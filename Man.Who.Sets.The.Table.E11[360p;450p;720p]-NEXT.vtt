00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.425
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.994
Even if you deny it, 
she's blood related to you.

3
00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:12.963
Get a paternity test.

4
00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:14.765
That will solve the problem.

5
00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:21.571
Why? What's wrong again?

6
00:00:21.872 --> 00:00:23.073
I want to go to the bathroom.

7
00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.509
That's why I told you to go to 
the bathroom before we leave.

8
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.914
Hurry up.

9
00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:32.215
Should I not go?

10
00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:36.820
That little girl is so rude. I'm offended.

11
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:39.122
Never mind.

12
00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:44.094
It doesn't matter whether someone 
else's child is rude or not.

13
00:00:44.428 --> 00:00:46.063
Everything will end tomorrow.

14
00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:52.869
Why is he here?

15
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.005
- Father. - Shut your mouth.

16
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:56.206
Wait a minute.

17
00:00:59.743 --> 00:01:01.845
Who is that child?

18
00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:03.680
I have a bad feeling.

19
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.083
I feel like there's a secret.

20
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.717
Stay here.

21
00:01:07.717 --> 00:01:10.520
Mom, wait for me.

22
00:01:11.388 --> 00:01:14.524
Where is this place? What department is it?

23
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.561
Genetic examination lab?

24
00:01:18.028 --> 00:01:21.665
Does genetic examination mean paternity test?

25
00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:23.467
Paternity test?

26
00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:24.601
What?

27
00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:31.108
Mom, I'm sure of it. It's written here.

28
00:01:31.108 --> 00:01:32.709
Genetic examination lab.

29
00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:34.311
Lower your voice.

30
00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:37.781
Do they do paternity tests here?

31
00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:40.283
We just saw it with our own eyes.

32
00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:42.752
Father went in there holding hands with a child.

33
00:01:46.623 --> 00:01:50.026
Your father-in-law is a man of energy.

34
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.364
He's as energetic...

35
00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.466
as eels in rice paddies.

36
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.969
Mom, this isn't the time to talk about his strength.

37
00:02:01.638 --> 00:02:04.641
I finally understand what happened.

38
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:07.911
So Won was with Father the day he slept out.

39
00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:10.447
The atmosphere between the two was suspicious.

40
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:13.750
They probably had an emergency meeting.

41
00:02:14.518 --> 00:02:16.987
Since the child is young,

42
00:02:18.088 --> 00:02:21.057
he must have been having an affair for 5 or 6 years.

43
00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:24.661
How could Mother not know at all?

44
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:28.398
Your Father is really smart.

45
00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.867
He was the director of a big company.

46
00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:35.839
He's in serious trouble in his life at a really old age.

47
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:37.274
Oh, my.

48
00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:43.280
Do you really want to laugh in this situation?

49
00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:45.549
Who is the mother of the child?

50
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:46.850
I'm not sure.

51
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.451
His secretary?

52
00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:52.989
What is the child's name?

53
00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.591
What's your name?

54
00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.093
Oh Han Gyul.

55
00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.462
Okay, Oh Han Gyul.

56
00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.165
- What's her date of birth? - Do you know it?

57
00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:07.671
- Who's her legal representative? - Lee So...

58
00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:09.873
Do you want to end So Won's career as a doctor?

59
00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:16.746
The moment the police takes Han Gyul in, the whole world will find out...

60
00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:20.850
that successful Doctor Lee So Won is a brazenface that ignores his child.

61
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:26.556
There's no need to involve So Won in this messy matter.

62
00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.625
Put Lee Shin Mo as her legal representative.

63
00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:30.927
Let's take some samples.

64
00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:35.532
Can you open your mouth?

65
00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:38.368
Open your mouth.

66
00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.611
Good job.

67
00:03:50.347 --> 00:03:53.250
- This is mine. - Okay.

68
00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.452
The results will be out right away tomorrow.

69
00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:57.687
Are the results accurate without any error?

70
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.557
Of course. It's accurate by 99.9 percent.

71
00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:03.126
Please do your best.

72
00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:06.496
Let's go.

73
00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.684
(Researcher Jung Su Hae)

74
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:41.431
I'm here to cook, not to clean toilets.

75
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.535
You're only a beginner. What do you expect?

76
00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:47.904
You'll easily give up on the things you acquired easily.

77
00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:50.173
Things that take effort will remain for a long time.

78
00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:56.980
Anyway, I became good at cleaning because of this.

79
00:04:58.982 --> 00:05:00.050
Let's go on to the next stall.

80
00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.926
Do you know that we're all booked today?

81
00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.096
You need to do your best at cleaning the kitchen during times like this.

82
00:05:13.663 --> 00:05:15.532
Especially the floor.

83
00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:18.101
Yes, ma'am.

84
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.278
You have a lot of dandruff. I didn't expect that from you.

85
00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:38.421
Is it okay for us to go visit her unexpectedly like this?

86
00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:42.058
Don't worry. Ru Ri will be really glad to see us.

87
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.528
You'll see when you get there, but it's really luxurious.

88
00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:47.530
She will want to show it off to you.

89
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.167
I'm proud of her when she goes to work every morning...

90
00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:52.569
dressed properly in a suit.

91
00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:56.906
It's all thanks of me. Please don't forget that.

92
00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:59.609
Okay, thank you.

93
00:06:00.477 --> 00:06:03.680
But will we be able to eat with her?

94
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.783
Of course. It's not that busy after peak time.

95
00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:09.419
A menu developer is very successful.

96
00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:11.688
She probably just has to point out things and not get messy.

97
00:06:16.493 --> 00:06:18.728
It's really big and luxurious.

98
00:06:18.728 --> 00:06:20.029
It is.

99
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:21.431
Please sit down.

100
00:06:25.602 --> 00:06:28.338
Since I will leave soon,

101
00:06:28.338 --> 00:06:31.040
I will order as much as I want.

102
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:34.477
Okay. Order whatever you want to eat.

103
00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:37.614
Really? I'm going to order everything.

104
00:06:40.784 --> 00:06:42.051
Hello, Ms. Hong.

105
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.889
Manager Jung.

106
00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:47.724
Hello, Manager Jung.

107
00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:51.494
I came here because I wasn't sure if it was you. What brings you here?

108
00:06:51.795 --> 00:06:56.900
I was curious of where Ru Ri was working.

109
00:06:57.534 --> 00:06:59.536
- Welcome. - Salute.

110
00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:01.404
I brought her here.

111
00:07:01.404 --> 00:07:04.240
She really wanted to see you.

112
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.044
Thank you for the holiday gift.

113
00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:10.980
This isn't much.

114
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.416
It's homemade jam.

115
00:07:14.784 --> 00:07:16.219
Thank you for the gift.

116
00:07:16.286 --> 00:07:18.922
Where is Ru Ri?

117
00:07:19.222 --> 00:07:21.157
She's getting trained in the kitchen.

118
00:07:21.157 --> 00:07:22.926
Oh, my. She's getting trained?

119
00:07:23.092 --> 00:07:25.094
That sounds awesome.

120
00:07:25.094 --> 00:07:27.096
Let's go see her.

121
00:07:28.665 --> 00:07:29.866
Can we do that?

122
00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:32.402
I'm curious how she is at work.

123
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.976
Yes, let's do that.

124
00:07:40.243 --> 00:07:41.478
Goodness.

125
00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:44.113
This is amazing.

126
00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:45.281
Let's go.

127
00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:47.217
This way.

128
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.295
Let's hurry. The customers are waiting.

129
00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:00.296
- Yes, chef. - Yes, chef.

130
00:08:00.296 --> 00:08:02.098
- The dish is coming! - Okay.

131
00:08:02.098 --> 00:08:03.800
Hurry, and cook the pasta for table three.

132
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.101
- Yes, chef! - Yes, chef!

133
00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:08.805
Chef!

134
00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:10.840
Are you all right?

135
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.842
Hey, Intern!

136
00:08:12.842 --> 00:08:15.411
You! Can't you do your work properly?

137
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:17.046
Do you clean the floor or not?

138
00:08:19.716 --> 00:08:20.850
Intern.

139
00:08:21.184 --> 00:08:22.685
Don't you understand Korean?

140
00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:26.356
Didn't I tell you to clean the floor just now?

141
00:08:26.356 --> 00:08:28.658
I just wiped the floor.

142
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:29.792
What?

143
00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:32.729
Then come here and touch the floor yourself.

144
00:08:32.862 --> 00:08:34.497
See if it's slippery or clean.

145
00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:36.666
- Excuse me? - I said to come here!

146
00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:40.003
- Goodness. - Be careful.

147
00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:43.072
I think I hurt my back badly.

148
00:08:45.074 --> 00:08:46.543
Touch it yourself right now.

149
00:08:50.647 --> 00:08:53.182
How is it? Is it clean just like you said?

150
00:08:54.584 --> 00:08:55.919
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:57.554 --> 00:09:00.623
You don't have common sense at all.

152
00:09:01.057 --> 00:09:03.293
Can't you see that the kitchen is filled with oil?

153
00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:06.296
When it's dinner rush, the oil gets all over the floor.

154
00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.631
Don't you know that the floor is covered with oil?

155
00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:11.134
You don't have the basic knowledge of how kitchen works.

156
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.369
How could you be so shameless to work at my kitchen?

157
00:09:14.571 --> 00:09:17.073
Goodness, you don't know your place.

158
00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:20.543
I'm sorry. I'll work on that.

159
00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:23.179
You're such a klutz who makes everyone's job harder than it is.

160
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:25.315
If I were you, I would've resigned long ago.

161
00:09:26.516 --> 00:09:28.318
Move! You're in my way.

162
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.422
Be careful.

163
00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:34.958
Chef, are you all right?

164
00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.960
- I was behind with dirty dishes. - Oh, my.

165
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.695
- I'm sorry. - Goodness.

166
00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:41.531
What are you doing? Clean up this mess.

167
00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:46.803
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

168
00:10:11.628 --> 00:10:12.929
Ma'am, the truth is...

169
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:16.299
Ms. Hong!

170
00:10:21.404 --> 00:10:22.639
Chef Jung.

171
00:10:22.939 --> 00:10:24.407
Your mom just saw everything.

172
00:10:33.583 --> 00:10:36.019
Mom, Mom!

173
00:10:36.452 --> 00:10:40.323
Mom! Why did you come without telling me?

174
00:10:40.623 --> 00:10:41.824
Let go of me.

175
00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:45.128
Mom, Mom.

176
00:10:45.528 --> 00:10:46.763
Please look at me, Mom.

177
00:10:46.763 --> 00:10:49.265
Please? I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

178
00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:51.934
I'm sorry that you had to see that.

179
00:10:53.369 --> 00:10:55.271
Do you have to work here?

180
00:10:55.304 --> 00:10:58.041
Is this the only job you can get? Is that why you're putting up with it?

181
00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.811
Unbelievable. I can't even speak. It's breaking my heart.

182
00:11:02.045 --> 00:11:03.646
I know how you must feel, Mom.

183
00:11:03.646 --> 00:11:06.282
I completely understand how you feel right now, Mom.

184
00:11:06.382 --> 00:11:09.318
But I'm really okay.

185
00:11:09.318 --> 00:11:12.588
No matter how humiliating this job is, I can deal with it.

186
00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:15.058
I deserved what just happened. That was my fault.

187
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.260
Ru Ri.

188
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.763
And my legs are all swollen because I have to stand the whole day.

189
00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:24.033
Look at my hands. Even though my hand is hurt badly,

190
00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:25.635
I'm really excited to work here.

191
00:11:25.802 --> 00:11:28.304
For the first time in my life, I found out what I can be good at.

192
00:11:28.304 --> 00:11:30.940
I just began to learn them one by one.

193
00:11:31.574 --> 00:11:34.877
Mom, I'm really doing okay.

194
00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:38.781
Okay, to be honest, it's physically demanding, and I'm tired.

195
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.451
But I'm happy. I'm serious, Mom.

196
00:11:45.054 --> 00:11:46.189
Ru Ri.

197
00:11:46.522 --> 00:11:48.758
Please watch me do this job for a while.

198
00:11:49.025 --> 00:11:52.028
This is the first job I chose.

199
00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:55.698
I might not be able to be good at this job, but...

200
00:11:56.532 --> 00:11:59.435
Dad didn't pick this job for me. I did.

201
00:11:59.702 --> 00:12:02.271
I want to be responsible of my choice until the end.

202
00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:07.410
Mom, cut me some slack until then. Please?

203
00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:16.119
I should have been more thoughtful.

204
00:12:16.953 --> 00:12:18.287
I'm sorry, ma'am.

205
00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:25.661
I...

206
00:12:27.063 --> 00:12:30.032
did my best to raise my daughter, Ru Ri.

207
00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:32.802
I never let her cook ramyeon growing up.

208
00:12:33.436 --> 00:12:36.539
I never let her wash a dirty pair of socks.

209
00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:42.912
But now that I look back,

210
00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:44.547
that's where I made my mistake.

211
00:12:48.918 --> 00:12:50.753
She's not street-smart...

212
00:12:50.753 --> 00:12:52.789
and isn't good at anything.

213
00:12:52.789 --> 00:12:54.557
She's sloppy in everything she does.

214
00:12:55.892 --> 00:12:58.327
She has just started working in this industry.

215
00:12:59.328 --> 00:13:01.697
Please scold her if she does something wrong.

216
00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:03.199
And if she's lacking,

217
00:13:06.669 --> 00:13:08.171
please teach her a lot.

218
00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:09.872
This is what I'd like to ask of you.

219
00:13:16.445 --> 00:13:17.580
Ms. Hong!

220
00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:29.292
I...

221
00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.661
am going to make it here.

222
00:13:33.196 --> 00:13:35.798
Whatever happens, I'm going to endure this.

223
00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:40.536
The next time my mom comes,

224
00:13:41.037 --> 00:13:44.574
I won't make my mom cry.

225
00:13:45.308 --> 00:13:46.542
Never.

226
00:13:49.212 --> 00:13:53.316
770, 780, 790, 800!

227
00:13:53.316 --> 00:13:54.784
With the savings, that makes 1,500 dollars!

228
00:13:54.784 --> 00:13:56.686
You can sign up for the hairdressing courses!

229
00:13:56.686 --> 00:13:59.488
Yes! Thanks for helping me out.

230
00:13:59.488 --> 00:14:01.424
When you get successful and open up a hair salon,

231
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.692
you'll have to do my hair for free.

232
00:14:02.692 --> 00:14:04.126
Say no more!

233
00:14:04.293 --> 00:14:06.028
Well, for the time being, have this instead.

234
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:09.765
It's good.

235
00:14:10.633 --> 00:14:12.001
You got crumbs on your mouth.

236
00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:13.636
Wipe them for me.

237
00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:19.775
There.

238
00:14:20.576 --> 00:14:24.447
Eun Byul, you're pretty.

239
00:14:25.414 --> 00:14:28.017
Do you know what my friends say about us? They say we're dating.

240
00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:29.118
Aren't you worried?

241
00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:31.888
You should hang out with your peers, but you spend your time with me.

242
00:14:31.888 --> 00:14:33.656
You know that I'm quite intelligent.

243
00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:35.658
My peers are so immature, so I don't like them.

244
00:14:35.658 --> 00:14:37.760
My maturity level is of the same with yours.

245
00:14:37.927 --> 00:14:40.763
What about you? Is it okay for you to hang out only with me?

246
00:14:40.763 --> 00:14:42.298
I don't like my friends either.

247
00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.433
They are stupidly too manly.

248
00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:46.936
You can't change your mind. Okay?

249
00:14:46.936 --> 00:14:49.739
Okay. You're coming with me to register for the courses, right?

250
00:14:49.739 --> 00:14:50.706
Yes.

251
00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:06.088
Sir.

252
00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:09.292
We must be at a factory in Daegu. We should leave now.

253
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.296
Cancel all of my schedule for today.

254
00:15:24.073 --> 00:15:25.141
(Jung Hwa Young)

255
00:15:25.141 --> 00:15:26.642
It's Ms. Jung Hwa Young's number.

256
00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:30.646
Since it's confirmed that she is Anna Kang,

257
00:15:31.147 --> 00:15:33.049
it'd be better if you meet her personally.

258
00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:38.521
I don't know how she will react.

259
00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:43.059
It's possible that she had already forgotten all about me.

260
00:15:43.292 --> 00:15:44.393
If that's the case,

261
00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.296
she wouldn't have come back to the cafe.

262
00:16:02.078 --> 00:16:04.780
Come to Flamenco in Hongdae at 2pm on Thursday.

263
00:16:04.914 --> 00:16:07.416
I'll show you what kind of woman you're living with.

264
00:16:13.656 --> 00:16:15.858
Why? Is it too loud?

265
00:16:16.025 --> 00:16:17.760
That's the soundtrack for my class tomorrow.

266
00:16:20.162 --> 00:16:21.797
I have a question to ask you.

267
00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:24.700
What is it? Tell me.

268
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.135
Do you know a dance studio Flamenco...

269
00:16:27.136 --> 00:16:28.637
in Hongdae?

270
00:16:32.041 --> 00:16:33.376
You know the studio, don't you?

271
00:16:33.709 --> 00:16:36.278
That viper, Choi Sun Young, found the place.

272
00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:38.080
How?

273
00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:40.182
How did she find the place?

274
00:16:40.182 --> 00:16:41.784
I think she met up with Woo Joo's birth dad.

275
00:16:43.452 --> 00:16:45.187
What a scumbag.

276
00:16:45.554 --> 00:16:48.324
I think she's going to go there at 2pm today.

277
00:16:48.557 --> 00:16:49.792
What?

278
00:16:50.793 --> 00:16:54.296
No, she can't go there.

279
00:16:56.198 --> 00:16:59.268
Did you check if the Latin dance instructor will be there today?

280
00:16:59.502 --> 00:17:02.138
I heard the instructor is the owner Flamenco.

281
00:17:02.138 --> 00:17:03.372
Is that so?

282
00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:05.641
Then she should be there.

283
00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:08.778
Will Mr. Go Jung Do be there as well?

284
00:17:09.045 --> 00:17:11.180
Yes, he'll be there. I'm sure of it.

285
00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:14.650
I bet he's even more curious to find out her true colors than I.

286
00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:23.692
Is this Flamenco?

287
00:17:24.326 --> 00:17:25.895
This is urgent.

288
00:17:25.895 --> 00:17:28.230
Can I talk to Ms. Yeon?

289
00:17:29.732 --> 00:17:32.701
Is that so? Okay.

290
00:17:33.836 --> 00:17:35.104
She's not in the studio?

291
00:17:35.104 --> 00:17:36.939
She stepped out for a moment.

292
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.443
What if she's meeting up with Choi Sun Young?

293
00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:41.811
No way.

294
00:17:42.211 --> 00:17:44.880
That viper will at least wait for me until 2pm.

295
00:17:45.247 --> 00:17:48.350
She's desperately trying to break us apart.

296
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.456
We only have 10 minutes left. Let's hurry.

297
00:17:53.622 --> 00:17:54.657
Okay.

298
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.408
Excuse me for a moment.

299
00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:20.416
It's been a long time.

300
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.451
Who are you?

301
00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:24.420
Mi Joo.

302
00:18:25.254 --> 00:18:26.822
I don't know you.

303
00:18:26.956 --> 00:18:31.560
Didn't you pretend not to know me when we met a few years ago?

304
00:18:32.895 --> 00:18:34.430
I'm sorry. I did that because...

305
00:18:34.964 --> 00:18:37.867
I was in a bad situation then.

306
00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.902
Has the situation changed?

307
00:18:40.336 --> 00:18:42.204
To make you come here in person?

308
00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:45.141
We came here to ask you a favor. Please help us.

309
00:18:46.509 --> 00:18:50.112
Mi Joo, someone will visit you soon.

310
00:18:50.179 --> 00:18:53.449
If they ask about me, just say that you don't know anything.

311
00:18:53.582 --> 00:18:55.651
That person must not know about me.

312
00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:57.453
Anna Kang.

313
00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:03.559
Please. My life depends on your words.

314
00:19:03.692 --> 00:19:05.628
Please help me. It'll be like saving my life.

315
00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:12.835
I ask sincerely. I heard that you were friends.

316
00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:14.103
Please help her.

317
00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:38.561
Did you make a reservation?

318
00:19:38.561 --> 00:19:41.197
I'm here to meet your boss. Is she here?

319
00:19:41.197 --> 00:19:43.065
- She's downstairs. - Really?

320
00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:45.067
I'll go downstairs then.

321
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.435
You can't.

322
00:19:46.702 --> 00:19:49.738
She's with other guests. I'll bring her here.

323
00:19:54.743 --> 00:19:55.978
Other guests?

324
00:20:07.856 --> 00:20:09.959
Seattle Dance Academy?

325
00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:27.243
I ask sincerely. Please help her.

326
00:20:27.243 --> 00:20:29.478
Think of our old friendship. You only have to not say anything.

327
00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:31.981
Say that you don't know my name or anything about me.

328
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:35.117
Just say that we've never met.

329
00:20:37.453 --> 00:20:38.687
Please.

330
00:20:41.423 --> 00:20:42.558
Do me a favor.

331
00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:46.528
A guest is asking for you.

332
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.598
Who?

333
00:20:49.598 --> 00:20:52.167
She's in her 50s and has short hair.

334
00:20:52.635 --> 00:20:54.703
Is this the person you're talking about?

335
00:20:54.703 --> 00:20:56.272
Yes. What should we do?

336
00:20:57.973 --> 00:21:00.309
Hurry, and follow me. We have a back door.

337
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:02.077
Thank you.

338
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.082
- Thank you. - Thank you.

339
00:21:07.082 --> 00:21:08.617
You don't have to thank me. Hurry.

340
00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:21.430
Why aren't they contacting me? There's no reason for that.

341
00:21:25.634 --> 00:21:27.169
Did you ask for me?

342
00:21:27.503 --> 00:21:28.637
Are you the owner here?

343
00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:33.075
Who are you?

344
00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:34.510
You don't have to know that.

345
00:21:34.743 --> 00:21:38.080
I'm going to be straightforward since you must be busy.

346
00:21:38.614 --> 00:21:40.649
Do you know a woman named Anna?

347
00:21:41.116 --> 00:21:42.251
Anna?

348
00:21:44.987 --> 00:21:47.222
Her other name is Jung Hwa Young.

349
00:21:48.524 --> 00:21:51.660
I don't think I've ever met her.

350
00:21:52.928 --> 00:21:54.430
Was she one of my guests?

351
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.864
Look again carefully.

352
00:21:56.865 --> 00:22:00.936
I have accurate information that you know her well.

353
00:22:05.174 --> 00:22:06.675
You made a wrong guess.

354
00:22:07.343 --> 00:22:10.679
I'll make it clear. I don't know this woman...

355
00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:12.915
nor Anna.

356
00:22:26.895 --> 00:22:27.996
What is that?

357
00:22:43.712 --> 00:22:44.947
What are you looking at?

358
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.015
I think Go Jung Do took the initiative.

359
00:22:47.216 --> 00:22:48.417
He just left this place.

360
00:22:49.918 --> 00:22:53.956
Of course. The owner seemed to know her, but didn't say anything.

361
00:22:53.956 --> 00:22:56.258
I'm sure that she knows about Jung Hwa Young.

362
00:22:56.358 --> 00:22:58.660
She went to the Seattle Dance Academy.

363
00:22:58.927 --> 00:23:00.596
They were both dancers.

364
00:23:00.929 --> 00:23:03.332
They said that Jung Hwa Young was quite good at English.

365
00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:06.935
There are too many things in common to say that they are strangers.

366
00:23:06.935 --> 00:23:08.704
- Should we go again? - There's no use.

367
00:23:09.071 --> 00:23:11.006
They must have silenced her.

368
00:23:11.407 --> 00:23:14.176
Find out how we can make her talk again...

369
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.677
with any means possible.

370
00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:17.079
Yes, ma'am.

371
00:23:29.258 --> 00:23:32.060
He must be getting a paternity test.

372
00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:43.238
It's always the quiet ones that get in trouble.

373
00:23:43.739 --> 00:23:47.176
Oh, my. I never imagined...

374
00:23:48.243 --> 00:23:50.679
that gentleman doing anything seedy,

375
00:23:50.879 --> 00:23:52.448
especially of that scale.

376
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.752
- Mom. - Yes?

377
00:23:56.919 --> 00:23:59.688
What should I do?

378
00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:02.658
Should I reveal his affair or not?

379
00:24:03.325 --> 00:24:05.727
I'm thinking about it.

380
00:24:06.395 --> 00:24:07.963
So Won must also know.

381
00:24:08.263 --> 00:24:12.201
Isn't it better for Mother if we reveal it as fast as we can?

382
00:24:12.468 --> 00:24:16.171
What will you do if she asks for a divorce...

383
00:24:16.738 --> 00:24:20.609
and not a graduation?

384
00:24:21.009 --> 00:24:25.747
No, she's too soft-hearted. She could never do that.

385
00:24:26.248 --> 00:24:30.219
I'm going to tell her everything since I feel so bad for Mother.

386
00:24:30.953 --> 00:24:32.488
Honey, I'm home.

387
00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:34.957
He's here. I'm going to reveal it.

388
00:24:34.957 --> 00:24:36.091
Do it.

389
00:24:36.325 --> 00:24:38.927
Honey, something serious happened.

390
00:24:39.661 --> 00:24:42.798
She also has a big mouth like me.

391
00:24:42.998 --> 00:24:46.969
Her father-in-law will be in big trouble today.

392
00:25:00.148 --> 00:25:01.250
Are you done eating?

393
00:25:01.683 --> 00:25:02.751
Why?

394
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.492
Stop eating. You had enough.

395
00:25:10.492 --> 00:25:12.594
Your little stomach is going to explode.

396
00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:22.371
Who is your dad?

397
00:25:26.074 --> 00:25:28.677
You must remember who your birth father is.

398
00:25:29.378 --> 00:25:30.479
You saw him, right?

399
00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:35.417
Tell me. Who is your dad?

400
00:25:36.218 --> 00:25:37.419
Give me some water.

401
00:25:40.856 --> 00:25:44.092
Okay. I shouldn't expect a lot from you.

402
00:25:53.502 --> 00:25:54.903
What is it?

403
00:25:54.937 --> 00:25:58.173
I called you because I haven't heard from you today.

404
00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.441
Where are you?

405
00:25:59.508 --> 00:26:02.311
Where would I be? I'm outside.

406
00:26:02.844 --> 00:26:03.912
Really?

407
00:26:04.413 --> 00:26:08.317
I thought you were at So Won's place so I was going to bring you food.

408
00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:11.653
You don't have to come here. I'll be home soon.

409
00:26:11.687 --> 00:26:12.921
Give me water.

410
00:26:14.523 --> 00:26:17.159
I'll be home soon. I'll hang up.

411
00:26:23.799 --> 00:26:25.334
Where are you going?

412
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.369
I'm going with you.

413
00:26:27.903 --> 00:26:29.071
What?

414
00:26:30.772 --> 00:26:32.174
I can't believe this.

415
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.678
What did you want to tell me?

416
00:26:37.312 --> 00:26:40.349
Something really serious happened. Don't be surprised after hearing it.

417
00:26:40.482 --> 00:26:42.417
Don't you also know about it?

418
00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:43.752
What is it?

419
00:26:44.219 --> 00:26:46.588
I'm not surprised easily. Just tell me.

420
00:26:47.723 --> 00:26:50.392
Honey, that is...

421
00:26:50.392 --> 00:26:52.928
Father...

422
00:26:53.662 --> 00:26:56.298
My heart is racing. Mom, tell him about it for me.

423
00:26:57.933 --> 00:27:01.603
You have a younger sibling.

424
00:27:03.939 --> 00:27:06.174
- A younger sibling? - Yes.

425
00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:12.247
We met your Father accidentally at the hospital.

426
00:27:12.681 --> 00:27:15.951
We met him at the paternity test room...

427
00:27:15.951 --> 00:27:18.920
with a child this big.

428
00:27:20.188 --> 00:27:23.592
Oh, my. Are you okay, honey?

429
00:27:24.192 --> 00:27:27.229
See? I told you not to be surprised.

430
00:27:27.596 --> 00:27:31.366
Did you really see Father with Han Gyul?

431
00:27:32.434 --> 00:27:33.502
Oh, my.

432
00:27:34.002 --> 00:27:36.438
How do you know the child's name?

433
00:27:36.605 --> 00:27:37.639
Sorry?

434
00:27:38.974 --> 00:27:40.642
That's because...

435
00:27:40.976 --> 00:27:45.147
Since it turned out this way, let's just tell Mother.

436
00:27:45.313 --> 00:27:48.750
It's better to face difficulties as early as possible. I'll tell her.

437
00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:51.186
- Let me call her. - Wait a minute.

438
00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:53.355
Trust me with this.

439
00:27:54.256 --> 00:27:56.658
Since we're not sure,

440
00:27:56.658 --> 00:27:59.761
let's tell her after we find out the truth.

441
00:27:59.961 --> 00:28:01.663
But still...

442
00:28:01.663 --> 00:28:02.931
It just takes one day.

443
00:28:03.331 --> 00:28:06.968
It will take one day to check if the child is his or not.

444
00:28:07.502 --> 00:28:09.971
Please wait until then. I beg you.

445
00:28:11.707 --> 00:28:13.842
All right. But...

446
00:28:14.009 --> 00:28:18.113
I'll only wait 1 more day. 1 day.

447
00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:22.451
We'll wait one more day. Okay?

448
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.905
She's not street-smart...

449
00:28:44.406 --> 00:28:46.508
and isn't good at anything.

450
00:28:46.508 --> 00:28:48.477
She's sloppy in everything she does.

451
00:28:48.477 --> 00:28:50.879
Please scold her if she does something wrong.

452
00:28:50.879 --> 00:28:53.682
And if she's lacking, please teach her.

453
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:55.584
This is what I'd like to ask of you.

454
00:29:02.657 --> 00:29:04.493
Ru Ri, how do you feel?

455
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.895
You've completed the two weeks of work training.

456
00:29:07.429 --> 00:29:09.097
I'm very upset.

457
00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:11.433
I still don't know anything...

458
00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:13.902
and lack in so many ways, but it's already over.

459
00:29:15.103 --> 00:29:17.405
From next week, you'll work at the Menu Research and Development Team.

460
00:29:17.405 --> 00:29:19.174
You can work harder there.

461
00:29:19.174 --> 00:29:20.242
Let's go for now.

462
00:29:20.442 --> 00:29:23.678
I'll buy you dinner to congratulate you for surviving well.

463
00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:26.047
You should go. I need to stay behind and practice.

464
00:29:26.047 --> 00:29:27.082
Hey.

465
00:29:27.916 --> 00:29:30.218
You won't get better overnight.

466
00:29:30.418 --> 00:29:32.654
You've done so much so far. You should get some rest.

467
00:29:32.654 --> 00:29:33.889
Resting is part of the job.

468
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:35.423
I said no.

469
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.426
I'm so anxious. This is the least I can do.

470
00:29:39.127 --> 00:29:41.363
I made a promise to my mother.

471
00:29:41.496 --> 00:29:42.998
And Manager Joo...

472
00:29:43.665 --> 00:29:46.067
tries to get rid of me every day.

473
00:29:46.668 --> 00:29:48.603
I want to become better as soon as possible,

474
00:29:48.603 --> 00:29:50.172
so that I can be confident in front of her.

475
00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:03.518
Scores for Lee Ru Ri's work as an intern.

476
00:30:04.252 --> 00:30:06.421
The first evaluator's opinion.

477
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:10.091
There is no possibility that she could ever improve.

478
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:12.727
Paying her to work for us will be a total waste of money.

479
00:30:12.928 --> 00:30:16.631
I strongly suggest that we fire her.

480
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:24.706
Aren't you going home yet?

481
00:30:25.607 --> 00:30:26.741
Dad!

482
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.879
I'm the manager. I need to set an example.

483
00:30:33.248 --> 00:30:35.417
You must have been evaluating the interns.

484
00:30:35.417 --> 00:30:38.353
Yes. Before we send them to the actual team,

485
00:30:38.353 --> 00:30:40.021
I think we need to fire Lee Ru Ri first.

486
00:30:40.889 --> 00:30:42.157
She's an intern for six months,

487
00:30:42.157 --> 00:30:43.758
but I can do whatever I want with her, right?

488
00:30:44.159 --> 00:30:45.594
Lee Ru Ri?

489
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:48.230
Isn't she Jung Tae Yang's assistant?

490
00:30:48.463 --> 00:30:49.664
Yes, she is.

491
00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:51.933
Is there a problem?

492
00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:53.668
You should reconsider it.

493
00:30:53.969 --> 00:30:56.538
Why? She's such a nuisance.

494
00:30:56.538 --> 00:31:00.175
Do you remember the man who saved my life in Bali?

495
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.478
Do you mean the man...

496
00:31:03.478 --> 00:31:05.947
who worked at the hotel and served your meal?

497
00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:08.416
That man was Chef Jung Tae Yang.

498
00:31:09.751 --> 00:31:12.787
I've been looking for him all over the place,

499
00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:14.956
but I met him here by destiny.

500
00:31:15.824 --> 00:31:17.926
He has skills, and he's a great man overall.

501
00:31:17.926 --> 00:31:19.461
I'm keeping an eye on him to see if he's really all right.

502
00:31:19.895 --> 00:31:21.863
You are keeping an eye on him?

503
00:31:23.865 --> 00:31:27.102
Are you planning to give him an important job at the company?

504
00:31:27.102 --> 00:31:28.370
I might.

505
00:31:32.707 --> 00:31:36.678
That's why I want you to pay special attention to him.

506
00:31:37.646 --> 00:31:38.647
Okay?

507
00:31:40.248 --> 00:31:41.383
Good luck with your work.

508
00:31:45.587 --> 00:31:46.821
This is unbelievable.

509
00:31:47.689 --> 00:31:50.058
Jung Tae Yang was the man who saved my dad's life?

510
00:31:51.893 --> 00:31:54.429
Then I should really make sure that Lee Ru Ri doesn't stay here.

511
00:32:02.938 --> 00:32:04.172
(Basic Italian Food)

512
00:32:13.581 --> 00:32:15.016
(Anyone can cook if they try.)

513
00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:17.585
(The way to success is to eat food I like, cheer up, and try harder.)

514
00:32:20.822 --> 00:32:23.758
I want to get my life back.

515
00:32:23.959 --> 00:32:27.128
I've never lived my life as I wanted.

516
00:32:27.128 --> 00:32:30.165
This is the first job I chose.

517
00:32:30.432 --> 00:32:31.633
I...

518
00:32:32.233 --> 00:32:33.868
am going to make it here.

519
00:32:37.372 --> 00:32:39.074
What am I going to do with this fool?

520
00:32:41.743 --> 00:32:43.912
If you can see the core of the noodle after you cut it,

521
00:32:43.912 --> 00:32:46.414
that means you boiled it just the right amount.

522
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:48.316
All right.

523
00:32:57.659 --> 00:32:59.661
What? Where's the core?

524
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.199
Should I just throw it at the wall?

525
00:33:08.069 --> 00:33:11.172
Oh, my. It stuck on the wall. Yes!

526
00:33:12.374 --> 00:33:14.409
Oh, my. No.

527
00:33:15.677 --> 00:33:16.878
Gosh, it's hot.

528
00:33:22.517 --> 00:33:23.752
What is this smell?

529
00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:29.657
Oh, gosh.

530
00:33:30.392 --> 00:33:32.927
I can't believe this.

531
00:33:32.927 --> 00:33:33.962
Gosh, it's hot!

532
00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:35.930
Gosh.

533
00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:40.769
Gosh, Ru Ri.

534
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:49.577
You're not just dumb.

535
00:33:51.212 --> 00:33:52.480
You're the dumbest person on earth.

536
00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.156
You won't have any fingers left if you continue to do that.

537
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.392
Didn't you go home yet?

538
00:34:05.627 --> 00:34:06.828
Did you make all these?

539
00:34:17.138 --> 00:34:18.440
This is...

540
00:34:18.773 --> 00:34:21.576
Who are you going to kill with this food?

541
00:34:21.776 --> 00:34:24.279
Why are you playing with food?

542
00:34:26.047 --> 00:34:28.083
Don't interrupt me. Just leave.

543
00:34:28.249 --> 00:34:31.186
I'll master how to cook tomato pasta today.

544
00:34:42.497 --> 00:34:43.498
Try it.

545
00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:44.666
What is it?

546
00:34:54.943 --> 00:34:57.712
Did you boil cow bones in here?

547
00:34:58.213 --> 00:34:59.247
And?

548
00:35:00.048 --> 00:35:03.618
I can taste onions and celeries.

549
00:35:03.751 --> 00:35:05.286
And of course, there are tomatoes.

550
00:35:09.124 --> 00:35:10.692
There's butter...

551
00:35:11.693 --> 00:35:12.894
and bay leaf!

552
00:35:13.561 --> 00:35:14.596
Did I get it right?

553
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:16.831
It's western meat broth.

554
00:35:17.398 --> 00:35:20.335
It's called "brown stock". You got nearly everything right.

555
00:35:22.537 --> 00:35:25.607
It doesn't matter anyway. I can't make it myself.

556
00:35:26.508 --> 00:35:27.542
Lee Ru Ri,

557
00:35:28.209 --> 00:35:29.911
you don't cook alone.

558
00:35:30.712 --> 00:35:33.481
If everyone does his or her job,

559
00:35:33.982 --> 00:35:35.717
the food will taste wonderful.

560
00:35:36.684 --> 00:35:39.254
So, for now, I'll do the cooking,

561
00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:43.057
and you can help me with your sensitive taste.

562
00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:44.459
Chef Jung.

563
00:35:44.459 --> 00:35:46.728
If you're too anxious, you'll only make more mistakes.

564
00:35:47.529 --> 00:35:49.731
What you need now is not speed,

565
00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:51.866
but to believe in yourself.

566
00:35:55.503 --> 00:35:58.139
Why? You can't believe me again?

567
00:36:00.608 --> 00:36:02.577
Do you want me to teach you...

568
00:36:03.478 --> 00:36:04.579
how valuable you are?

569
00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:11.619
What? Mrs. Yang saw you at the hospital?

570
00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:14.923
So? Were you dumb enough to tell her everything?

571
00:36:15.056 --> 00:36:18.226
Calm down. Everyone thinks that...

572
00:36:18.793 --> 00:36:20.728
it was you, not me.

573
00:36:20.728 --> 00:36:22.797
What?

574
00:36:23.598 --> 00:36:25.733
They think it was me?

575
00:36:26.334 --> 00:36:30.505
So you mean to tell me that after 60 years of living in pureness,

576
00:36:30.505 --> 00:36:33.374
that blame is on me?

577
00:36:34.042 --> 00:36:35.810
How could you?

578
00:36:37.812 --> 00:36:39.948
Wait, no.

579
00:36:40.715 --> 00:36:41.749
No.

580
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:44.419
Yes.

581
00:36:44.752 --> 00:36:47.522
This is a relief...

582
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.857
that I took the blame.

583
00:36:50.058 --> 00:36:51.893
We can't keep it a secret anymore.

584
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.728
They saw me while I was doing the paternal test.

585
00:36:53.728 --> 00:36:55.063
We can't do anything anymore.

586
00:36:55.063 --> 00:36:56.431
Don't make it worse.

587
00:36:56.431 --> 00:36:59.267
It will be finished tomorrow. You don't need to make it worse.

588
00:36:59.267 --> 00:37:02.537
What if she is my child?

589
00:37:02.937 --> 00:37:06.441
I told you that it's not possible.

590
00:37:07.008 --> 00:37:08.409
Look at her.

591
00:37:09.143 --> 00:37:12.313
How can she be of our blood?

592
00:37:15.516 --> 00:37:16.751
Look at her eyes.

593
00:37:17.318 --> 00:37:19.120
They look like yours and mine.

594
00:37:19.187 --> 00:37:20.888
She also has long eyelashes.

595
00:37:22.457 --> 00:37:25.727
Children nowadays all have long eyelashes...

596
00:37:25.727 --> 00:37:27.562
because of fine dust.

597
00:37:28.096 --> 00:37:30.465
And moreover,

598
00:37:30.698 --> 00:37:34.269
if you look at how she acts, you just know she's not one of us.

599
00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:36.170
She has no manners at all.

600
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.106
And she eats too much.

601
00:37:38.106 --> 00:37:40.441
Look at her. Look at how she eats.

602
00:37:45.913 --> 00:37:47.348
She's just like Ru Ri.

603
00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:49.250
She can eat up to four servings.

604
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.019
I told you it's not possible.

605
00:37:51.219 --> 00:37:54.088
Anyways, look after her.

606
00:37:54.088 --> 00:37:55.757
Where are you going?

607
00:37:56.357 --> 00:37:59.327
So Won, I haven't gone home for two days.

608
00:38:00.328 --> 00:38:03.231
Try babysitting. You'll realize how hard it is.

609
00:38:07.235 --> 00:38:08.603
Gosh.

610
00:38:28.956 --> 00:38:31.559
For the first time in my life, I found out what I can be good at.

611
00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:34.028
I just began to learn them one by one.

612
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:38.099
Mom, I'm really doing okay.

613
00:38:38.966 --> 00:38:42.003
Okay, Ru Ri. Try your best.

614
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:45.273
I had a dream once too.

615
00:38:55.817 --> 00:38:59.387
(Certificate)

616
00:38:59.487 --> 00:39:00.788
(This certifies the above student...)

617
00:39:00.788 --> 00:39:02.056
(completed Seoul City Commentator program.)

618
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.597
Why didn't you greet me even though I'm home?

619
00:39:10.832 --> 00:39:13.101
- Did you have dinner? - Don't worry about it.

620
00:39:14.502 --> 00:39:16.838
I'm tired. Fill the bathtub for me.

621
00:39:17.372 --> 00:39:18.506
Gosh.

622
00:39:24.078 --> 00:39:27.749
What made him so tired?

623
00:39:31.919 --> 00:39:37.158
Gosh. I'm tired.

624
00:39:37.158 --> 00:39:38.559
My goodness.

625
00:39:39.026 --> 00:39:41.829
Farming is better than babysitting.

626
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.066
No human can do this.

627
00:39:53.307 --> 00:39:54.442
Honey.

628
00:39:54.976 --> 00:39:57.211
Honey. We're in trouble.

629
00:39:57.211 --> 00:39:59.547
Honey. Wake up. We're in trouble.

630
00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:02.617
What? What is it?

631
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.752
What's going on?

632
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.788
Father.

633
00:40:09.557 --> 00:40:12.660
What's going on?

634
00:40:12.927 --> 00:40:15.997
Hey. Why would you bring her here?

635
00:40:16.597 --> 00:40:19.434
- Do you know her? - No. It's...

636
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.036
Whatever, Father. It's over now.

637
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.105
Over? What is?

638
00:40:24.105 --> 00:40:26.140
My mother-in-law found out. I'm divorced now.

639
00:40:26.374 --> 00:40:27.809
She kicked me out of my hospital.

640
00:40:28.142 --> 00:40:29.277
What?

641
00:40:29.877 --> 00:40:31.946
What's going on?

642
00:40:31.946 --> 00:40:33.981
Han Gyul. Say hello.

643
00:40:34.148 --> 00:40:36.818
She's your grandmother.

644
00:40:36.818 --> 00:40:38.119
How are you?

645
00:40:41.789 --> 00:40:42.957
Honey.

646
00:40:43.524 --> 00:40:45.660
This isn't real.

647
00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.063
This can't be happening. No.

648
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:51.599
This can never happen. No. Never.

649
00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:53.935
No. No. No.

650
00:40:53.935 --> 00:40:56.170
This can't happen. No. Not this.

651
00:40:56.170 --> 00:41:02.043
- No. No. No. - Honey.

652
00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:04.912
No. No. No.

653
00:41:08.115 --> 00:41:10.418
Where's So Won?

654
00:41:10.518 --> 00:41:12.620
Were you dreaming?

655
00:41:13.387 --> 00:41:16.290
You must be very tired.

656
00:41:17.658 --> 00:41:21.963
You're sweating so much.

657
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:23.831
Look at you.

658
00:41:25.666 --> 00:41:28.102
What is it? Did you have a nightmare?

659
00:41:28.603 --> 00:41:30.538
How old are you this year?

660
00:41:30.771 --> 00:41:33.541
Why? I'll be 60 soon.

661
00:41:35.276 --> 00:41:36.777
You're still young.

662
00:41:37.411 --> 00:41:39.146
Life starts when you turn 60.

663
00:41:42.316 --> 00:41:46.020
Since we're on the topic,

664
00:41:46.888 --> 00:41:48.789
do you get bored lately?

665
00:41:49.891 --> 00:41:53.928
I do. Ru Ri's out working.

666
00:41:55.062 --> 00:41:58.266
The day is long. The time flies. Nothing's worthwhile.

667
00:42:00.668 --> 00:42:03.938
Since we're at it,

668
00:42:04.672 --> 00:42:07.708
do you want to live with a purpose?

669
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:09.443
What do you mean?

670
00:42:10.811 --> 00:42:13.714
Do you want to raise a kid? It's a girl.

671
00:42:13.948 --> 00:42:15.016
What?

672
00:42:15.416 --> 00:42:20.087
Does Yeon Ju want us to babysit when she gives birth?

673
00:42:20.121 --> 00:42:22.957
They're rich, so I'll never get a chance,

674
00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:25.660
but I'd never say yes, so don't ever talk about it.

675
00:42:25.793 --> 00:42:27.728
My goodness. I can't believe she said that.

676
00:42:28.663 --> 00:42:30.665
Why not? Don't you want to?

677
00:42:31.332 --> 00:42:35.369
The only thing you're good at is raising a kid.

678
00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:38.673
Haven't you heard about the "grandchild sickness"?

679
00:42:38.673 --> 00:42:40.508
You'll hurt all your joints in your body,

680
00:42:40.508 --> 00:42:42.810
and you'll end up getting depression and exasperation.

681
00:42:42.944 --> 00:42:48.249
Also, I'm so fed up with being a mother for the last 34 years.

682
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:50.685
I want to live as Hong Young Hye now.

683
00:42:51.018 --> 00:42:54.188
Not a mother or anyone else, but myself, Hong Young Hye.

684
00:42:54.622 --> 00:42:56.791
Goodness. That's hilarious.

685
00:42:57.191 --> 00:43:01.162
Hey, you're useless as Hong Young Hye.

686
00:43:01.295 --> 00:43:04.465
You were useful because you were a mother.

687
00:43:04.799 --> 00:43:06.601
- What? - And...

688
00:43:06.867 --> 00:43:09.003
don't you have maternal affection?

689
00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:12.640
Everyone becomes grandparents and babysits at late age.

690
00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.408
Do you think you're different?

691
00:43:14.408 --> 00:43:17.078
Your son's asking you to babysit because he's having trouble.

692
00:43:17.078 --> 00:43:19.647
You don't want to do it that you cut it so coldly?

693
00:43:20.414 --> 00:43:21.682
What did you say?

694
00:43:21.749 --> 00:43:24.118
If that's so easy, you do it.

695
00:43:24.218 --> 00:43:27.388
I'm going to do what I want from now on.

696
00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:29.056
What do you want to do?

697
00:43:29.624 --> 00:43:33.227
I only did chores until now after I married you at the age of 23.

698
00:43:33.227 --> 00:43:35.496
I want to have a job or something like that.

699
00:43:35.596 --> 00:43:38.366
Have what? A job?

700
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.236
You're so funny.

701
00:43:43.004 --> 00:43:45.640
Who would hire you...

702
00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.810
when you have no work experience but house chores?

703
00:43:49.944 --> 00:43:53.848
You're not even strong enough to wash the dishes in a restaurant.

704
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:57.852
You're less competitive than a 40-year-old Chinese woman...

705
00:43:57.852 --> 00:44:01.389
who can't speak a word of Korean.

706
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:04.892
So stop being so smart,

707
00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:08.229
know your position, and just babysit at home.

708
00:44:10.498 --> 00:44:11.732
Are you done now?

709
00:44:11.966 --> 00:44:13.834
Yes, I'm done. So what?

710
00:44:16.937 --> 00:44:18.039
Never mind.

711
00:44:18.039 --> 00:44:22.576
I was stupid to think that you've changed.

712
00:44:23.277 --> 00:44:25.146
The bath is ready. Go wash now,

713
00:44:25.146 --> 00:44:26.981
and wash your filthy mouth too.

714
00:44:27.815 --> 00:44:30.518
What? Hey, Hong Young Hye.

715
00:44:30.685 --> 00:44:32.119
Hey, Hong Young Hye.

716
00:44:34.622 --> 00:44:38.125
Why's she so edgy?

717
00:44:38.392 --> 00:44:40.661
It's not like the kid is here right now.

718
00:44:41.962 --> 00:44:44.999
I only brought it up just in case.

719
00:44:45.866 --> 00:44:47.268
Gosh.

720
00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:55.276
Father. You need to come fast.

721
00:44:55.376 --> 00:44:58.045
If I sleep out again, Mother said she will raid.

722
00:44:58.646 --> 00:45:00.214
Darn it.

723
00:45:00.915 --> 00:45:05.352
What should I say to go out in the middle of the night?

724
00:45:05.686 --> 00:45:07.588
My gosh.

725
00:45:08.422 --> 00:45:10.624
Talking about competitiveness.

726
00:45:10.624 --> 00:45:14.428
He forced me to do chores at home.

727
00:45:18.099 --> 00:45:20.968
What? Okay.

728
00:45:22.103 --> 00:45:23.237
I'll see you there.

729
00:45:30.044 --> 00:45:32.480
What? Are you going out?

730
00:45:33.748 --> 00:45:34.949
Didn't you hear?

731
00:45:35.916 --> 00:45:38.018
Dong Ki's father passed away.

732
00:45:39.019 --> 00:45:42.757
He passed away last year. You even went to his funeral.

733
00:45:43.524 --> 00:45:45.126
It's...

734
00:45:46.527 --> 00:45:50.231
It's not his father. It's his wife.

735
00:45:50.431 --> 00:45:52.500
You said she's buried in the family ground

736
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.168
What?

737
00:45:55.936 --> 00:46:00.040
I must be so shocked. I keep getting confused.

738
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:03.444
Dong Ki.

739
00:46:06.213 --> 00:46:07.982
Dong Ki's dead.

740
00:46:08.749 --> 00:46:09.850
What?

741
00:46:10.818 --> 00:46:12.853
Did you want to see me, Manager Joo?

742
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.390
I'm sorry. I wanted to discuss something with you.

743
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:18.359
Discuss what?

744
00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:20.561
Fairness is my motto.

745
00:46:20.961 --> 00:46:23.230
Regardless of how wealthy you are,

746
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:25.866
I believe people should be judged by their skill.

747
00:46:25.866 --> 00:46:28.235
That's right. I agree with you 100 percent.

748
00:46:28.235 --> 00:46:31.539
Aren't you offended, Chef No?

749
00:46:33.507 --> 00:46:34.608
About what?

750
00:46:35.142 --> 00:46:38.445
Jung Tae Yang and Lee Ru Ri were appointed by orders from above.

751
00:46:39.046 --> 00:46:42.750
They got the job by knowing the chairman instead of their skills.

752
00:46:43.584 --> 00:46:44.752
That's not all.

753
00:46:44.852 --> 00:46:47.788
They keep causing trouble depending on the chairman,

754
00:46:47.788 --> 00:46:49.857
and they don't even feel guilty.

755
00:46:49.957 --> 00:46:52.293
That's right. That's what I wanted to say.

756
00:46:52.526 --> 00:46:54.461
- But they still try very hard... - Hey.

757
00:46:58.833 --> 00:47:02.169
What should I do, Manager Joo?

758
00:47:04.638 --> 00:47:07.274
I'm on your side.

759
00:47:08.209 --> 00:47:12.079
I'll give you all my support. Let's cooperate.

760
00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:17.818
Okay. Thank you.

761
00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:19.687
Thank you.

762
00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.062
We're on a rooftop.

763
00:47:28.963 --> 00:47:30.598
- Lie down. - What?

764
00:47:31.465 --> 00:47:33.367
- Why? - I told you.

765
00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:36.370
I'll teach you how valuable you are.

766
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:37.738
It's fine.

767
00:47:38.138 --> 00:47:40.908
I know I'm not that valuable,

768
00:47:41.108 --> 00:47:42.910
so you don't need to cheer me up.

769
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:45.045
Lie down. It's not hard to lie down.

770
00:47:46.413 --> 00:47:47.481
There.

771
00:47:50.317 --> 00:47:53.120
You always tell me to lie down.

772
00:47:58.392 --> 00:48:00.828
It's been a while since we lay down together.

773
00:48:01.328 --> 00:48:03.464
I don't have time to joke around.

774
00:48:03.464 --> 00:48:05.099
Stay still.

775
00:48:06.267 --> 00:48:08.102
Let's get this over with.

776
00:48:11.005 --> 00:48:12.139
What do you see?

777
00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:14.608
I see some stars in the sky.

778
00:48:14.608 --> 00:48:16.477
Chef Jung, I'm busy and...

779
00:48:16.477 --> 00:48:18.178
You're lucky.

780
00:48:18.812 --> 00:48:22.082
Don't you know how hard it is to see stars in Seoul?

781
00:48:30.057 --> 00:48:32.726
I told you about my family, right?

782
00:48:34.395 --> 00:48:35.396
Yes.

783
00:48:36.997 --> 00:48:39.099
You don't know your real father,

784
00:48:39.767 --> 00:48:42.436
and your mother has been married three times.

785
00:48:43.637 --> 00:48:45.039
When I was young,

786
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.808
people treated me like a weirdo.

787
00:48:48.943 --> 00:48:50.811
Whenever I was in town,

788
00:48:50.911 --> 00:48:52.746
people would talk behind my back.

789
00:48:54.214 --> 00:48:55.849
It was the same at school.

790
00:48:57.518 --> 00:49:00.020
Mom got too upset about it,

791
00:49:00.988 --> 00:49:02.656
so I pretended to be strong...

792
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.525
and bright.

793
00:49:05.659 --> 00:49:06.827
That's how I grew up.

794
00:49:09.596 --> 00:49:11.398
Do you know why I wandered around in other countries?

795
00:49:13.667 --> 00:49:17.538
Maybe because you wanted to learn recipes from all over the world?

796
00:49:20.307 --> 00:49:22.943
I wanted to be in a place where nobody knew who I was.

797
00:49:23.978 --> 00:49:26.347
I didn't want to act as if I were stronger or brighter.

798
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.982
I wanted to be myself.

799
00:49:29.016 --> 00:49:30.751
I wanted to live as I wanted.

800
00:49:32.186 --> 00:49:33.520
That's where I wanted to be.

801
00:49:34.288 --> 00:49:36.457
Then are you all right now?

802
00:49:37.558 --> 00:49:39.460
You came back to Korea.

803
00:49:40.294 --> 00:49:42.997
Yes, I came back.

804
00:49:43.831 --> 00:49:45.165
Do you know why?

805
00:49:48.102 --> 00:49:51.105
I met someone who could see me as who I was.

806
00:49:53.307 --> 00:49:54.808
When I'm with you,

807
00:49:55.209 --> 00:49:57.644
I don't need to pretend like I'm stronger or brighter.

808
00:49:58.812 --> 00:50:00.147
That's why I came back.

809
00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:02.116
It was because of you.

810
00:50:16.663 --> 00:50:17.898
Do you see now?

811
00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:21.602
You're a very valuable person.

812
00:50:44.024 --> 00:50:45.793
(Chairman Kevin Miller)

813
00:50:48.228 --> 00:50:49.329
(Jung Hwa Young)

814
00:50:49.329 --> 00:50:50.831
It's Ms. Jung Hwa Young's number.

815
00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:22.396
Don't worry. I'm keeping your secret.

816
00:51:22.396 --> 00:51:24.331
That witch won't come back again.

817
00:51:26.433 --> 00:51:27.468
Is it Mi Joo?

818
00:51:28.068 --> 00:51:29.036
Yes.

819
00:51:30.037 --> 00:51:32.806
There's no one else who knows about my secret now.

820
00:51:33.707 --> 00:51:35.409
Now I don't need to be worried.

821
00:51:40.481 --> 00:51:41.849
Can I just ask you one thing?

822
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:46.019
That day, Mi Joo called you...

823
00:51:46.887 --> 00:51:48.355
Anna Kang.

824
00:51:49.756 --> 00:51:51.859
Is that your real name?

825
00:51:54.061 --> 00:51:55.229
Tell me...

826
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:58.065
how you lived in the past.

827
00:52:11.812 --> 00:52:13.180
Hello?

828
00:52:14.047 --> 00:52:15.249
Hello?

829
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:18.085
Please talk. Hello?

830
00:52:21.688 --> 00:52:22.856
What is this?

831
00:52:23.123 --> 00:52:24.258
It's me.

832
00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:29.329
You wouldn't have forgotten my voice.

833
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:32.566
Jay?

834
00:52:35.102 --> 00:52:36.336
We need to meet.

835
00:52:37.137 --> 00:52:40.307
I'll wait for you at the coffee shop until you come.

836
00:52:44.211 --> 00:52:46.847
What is it? Who is it?

837
00:52:48.682 --> 00:52:50.184
Hwa Young, are you all right?

838
00:52:53.487 --> 00:52:54.988
What is it, Hwa Young?

839
00:52:59.526 --> 00:53:01.728
What is it, Hwa Young?

840
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:06.733
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

841
00:53:07.734 --> 00:53:09.269
Hwa Young, wait a moment.

842
00:53:10.037 --> 00:53:11.605
Hwa Young, here.

843
00:53:12.039 --> 00:53:14.942
Here. Breathe in. Hurry.

844
00:53:17.644 --> 00:53:18.912
Slowly.

845
00:53:19.246 --> 00:53:21.248
Slowly.

846
00:53:25.185 --> 00:53:26.353
Are you all right now?

847
00:53:29.556 --> 00:53:30.891
What is the matter?

848
00:53:30.891 --> 00:53:32.626
Who was that on the phone?

849
00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.894
(Expiration date, June 18, 2017)

850
00:54:19.006 --> 00:54:21.642
"I found a way to make Yeon Mi Joo talk."

851
00:54:31.918 --> 00:54:33.120
Hey.

852
00:54:52.773 --> 00:54:54.041
Sit up.

853
00:54:58.278 --> 00:54:59.546
Take this medicine.

854
00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:02.215
You couldn't breathe because you were too scared.

855
00:55:04.418 --> 00:55:05.519
Here.

856
00:55:12.893 --> 00:55:14.161
Take it.

857
00:55:14.895 --> 00:55:17.497
It's a tranquilizer. It'll help you to sleep.

858
00:55:17.831 --> 00:55:20.434
You'll get better after you get some sleep.

859
00:55:59.706 --> 00:56:02.209
(30 years ago, Seattle Dance Studio)

860
00:56:23.096 --> 00:56:25.599
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

861
00:57:06.606 --> 00:57:07.941
This feels like a dream.

862
00:57:09.075 --> 00:57:10.677
I was thinking about...

863
00:57:10.677 --> 00:57:13.547
the first time we met.

864
00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:17.417
It has been 30 years.

865
00:57:18.485 --> 00:57:20.353
It's been a while.

866
00:57:27.027 --> 00:57:29.229
You look pale. Drink some water.

867
00:57:29.496 --> 00:57:31.097
This could take long.

868
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:49.616
You don't need to be afraid.

869
00:57:50.016 --> 00:57:51.751
I'm not like the person I once was.

870
00:57:52.385 --> 00:57:54.421
Just like you're not your old self.

871
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.124
You look good.

872
00:57:58.959 --> 00:58:00.293
Unlike how you were before.

873
00:58:05.499 --> 00:58:07.000
Is there anything you want to say?

874
00:58:09.503 --> 00:58:12.005
I never forgot about that day.

875
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.676
I tried my best to forget it, but I couldn't,

876
00:58:17.577 --> 00:58:19.312
so I suffered...

877
00:58:20.981 --> 00:58:22.148
my whole life.

878
00:58:24.017 --> 00:58:27.587
You looked so happy to say that.

879
00:58:32.459 --> 00:58:33.894
Thank you...

880
00:58:35.529 --> 00:58:37.063
for staying alive, Anna Kang.

881
00:58:37.464 --> 00:58:38.732
I also want to thank you...

882
00:58:39.499 --> 00:58:42.636
for coming back alive.

883
00:58:57.717 --> 00:58:59.619
Let's talk for a moment.

884
00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:01.888
You already have my answer.

885
00:59:02.522 --> 00:59:05.191
I'm opening soon. Please leave.

886
00:59:07.561 --> 00:59:10.297
This place probably costed you quite a lot.

887
00:59:10.897 --> 00:59:12.966
It'll be a great loss to close this.

888
00:59:13.333 --> 00:59:14.868
What do you mean?

889
00:59:14.868 --> 00:59:18.038
You should've listened when I told you to say it.

890
00:59:18.038 --> 00:59:21.441
Hey, look. I don't know who you are talking about.

891
00:59:21.441 --> 00:59:22.709
Give me the phone.

892
00:59:28.481 --> 00:59:30.116
Do you know what's inside?

893
00:59:30.817 --> 00:59:33.620
You put two refrigerators outside in the hallway, didn't you?

894
00:59:33.687 --> 00:59:36.523
Running after open hours. That's not all.

895
00:59:36.756 --> 00:59:39.793
You had expired food inside the refrigerators.

896
00:59:39.793 --> 00:59:44.230
If I report this, you'll be suspended for seven days.

897
00:59:44.497 --> 00:59:45.599
Is that what you want?

898
00:59:45.599 --> 00:59:47.167
Are you threatening me?

899
00:59:48.335 --> 00:59:49.669
You don't get it.

900
00:59:49.936 --> 00:59:51.037
Call them now.

901
00:59:57.310 --> 00:59:58.578
Is this food sanitation supervision?

902
01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:01.648
What do you want?

903
01:00:02.082 --> 01:00:05.919
Everything you know about Anna.

904
01:00:15.662 --> 01:00:16.830
Hello?

905
01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:20.367
Hello, I'm Oh Dong Ki, the acupuncturist.

906
01:00:22.068 --> 01:00:24.871
Doctor Oh?

907
01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.407
Where are you going?

908
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:30.577
Dong Ki.

909
01:00:33.246 --> 01:00:34.981
Dong Ki's dead.

910
01:00:36.616 --> 01:00:40.754
How are you? Are you well?

911
01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:43.456
Of course. I don't have any problem.

912
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:48.028
I'm planning to go hiking, but I couldn't get hold of Shin Mo.

913
01:00:48.128 --> 01:00:49.295
Is he home?

914
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:51.197
Actually...

915
01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:54.167
I'll tell him to call you.

916
01:00:54.968 --> 01:00:56.603
Yes. Bye.

917
01:00:59.706 --> 01:01:01.708
He said he's going to the funeral.

918
01:01:01.941 --> 01:01:04.277
Where did he sleep after lying to me?

919
01:01:05.679 --> 01:01:06.980
Did he go to the So Won's apartment?

920
01:01:12.852 --> 01:01:16.122
Where are you?

921
01:01:16.556 --> 01:01:20.060
What do you mean? I'm at Dong Ki's funeral.

922
01:01:21.661 --> 01:01:22.796
When will you come home?

923
01:01:23.596 --> 01:01:27.167
My friend died. I should stay until the end.

924
01:01:28.001 --> 01:01:30.637
Okay. Bye.

925
01:01:38.311 --> 01:01:39.746
Why would she ask?

926
01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.588
Why would you open the refrigerator?

927
01:01:48.755 --> 01:01:50.056
You ate everything inside.

928
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.292
- I'm hungry. - What?

929
01:01:52.726 --> 01:01:56.730
We just shared three servings of ramyeon.

930
01:01:56.830 --> 01:01:59.099
It hasn't even been an hour yet. Why are you hungry?

931
01:01:59.733 --> 01:02:04.137
Gosh. There must be a bum inside your stomach.

932
01:02:04.237 --> 01:02:06.639
There must be like 10 of them.

933
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.309
You eat so much. Gosh.

934
01:02:18.118 --> 01:02:19.519
Where are you going?

935
01:02:21.254 --> 01:02:23.056
I'm going to buy bread for you.

936
01:02:23.256 --> 01:02:24.390
I'm coming with you.

937
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.728
Gosh, what a life.

938
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:33.767
Let's bear it. I'll get the result today.

939
01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:35.168
I'll bear it until then.

940
01:02:50.416 --> 01:02:52.218
Is that a mail?

941
01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.255
Do you live here?

942
01:02:56.556 --> 01:02:58.258
It's a mail for Lee Shin Mo.

943
01:02:58.391 --> 01:03:00.727
Yes. I'm his wife.

944
01:03:00.727 --> 01:03:03.296
I see. Here.

945
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.269
Please sign here.

946
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:11.638
Thank you.

947
01:03:11.771 --> 01:03:13.039
Thank you.

948
01:03:20.747 --> 01:03:22.615
Genetics laboratory.

949
01:03:24.984 --> 01:03:26.119
What's this?
