1
00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:28.376
Doctor Song, wake up. Doctor Song!

2
00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:32.145
Doctor Song!

3
00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:34.546
What is it?

4
00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:37.215
- We have a big problem. - What do you mean?

5
00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:38.916
Is there an emergency patient?

6
00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:41.516
It's not that.

7
00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:44.825
I don't know what to do.

8
00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:00.435
Is something wrong?

9
00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:02.836
Mr. Chu.

10
00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:06.076
What's going on?

11
00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:16.886
(Episode 25)

12
00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:19.085
- It's okay. - What are you saying?

13
00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:20.856
What are you doing after work today?

14
00:01:20.856 --> 00:01:22.925
Gosh, it stinks in here.

15
00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.496
Goodness, what's all this?

16
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.065
Whom did you take it from?

17
00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:30.266
Who are you?

18
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:32.835
Who is the boss here?

19
00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:35.975
There.

20
00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:39.915
I'm eating breakfast. Why is it so noisy?

21
00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:42.615
- Are you the boss? - I'm the owner of this place.

22
00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:45.315
The owner?

23
00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:47.686
What do you sell here?

24
00:01:47.686 --> 00:01:49.986
- Do you sell human organs? - What?

25
00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:52.656
What did you say to my friend?

26
00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:55.096
You told her to sell her organs, didn't you?

27
00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:56.496
Who's your friend?

28
00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:59.395
Song Eun Jae, the surgeon on the hospital ship.

29
00:02:03.736 --> 00:02:05.305
What a crazy punk.

30
00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.675
Put that spoon down.

31
00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:12.446
Put it down before I break your wrist, you jerk.

32
00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:14.446
Yes, sir.

33
00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:26.826
- Sir! - Mr. Yang!

34
00:02:26.826 --> 00:02:29.055
- Mr. Yang. - You're bleeding.

35
00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:30.895
- What? - Are you okay?

36
00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:35.136
Loan sharks?

37
00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:37.865
And you just let them go?

38
00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:38.905
Yes.

39
00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:42.775
My goodness, this is terrible.

40
00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:45.206
You should've stopped them.

41
00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.576
Mr. Yang went there too.

42
00:02:46.576 --> 00:02:48.446
Choon Ho can't handle them either.

43
00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:50.685
Loan sharks are...

44
00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:53.356
mostly gangsters, okay?

45
00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:56.286
Darn it.

46
00:02:57.286 --> 00:02:59.826
Aren't you worried about them?

47
00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:02.395
Of course, I am. I'm very worried.

48
00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:04.425
Then why are you looking at the computer?

49
00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:07.166
I still have to take care of the patients. What can I do?

50
00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:10.736
If something happens to Doctor Song and Mr. Chu...

51
00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:12.305
I should focus on my job even more then.

52
00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:14.775
- Gosh, you got... - A lot of guts?

53
00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:18.946
That's right. You have plenty of guts.

54
00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:21.416
It can even fill up the Pacific.

55
00:03:21.976 --> 00:03:24.286
Gosh. Oh, it must be them.

56
00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:31.756
My gosh, we thought you were Doctor Song.

57
00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:35.956
Why are you waiting for her?

58
00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:37.865
Is something wrong?

59
00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:40.066
It's none of your business.

60
00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:41.965
You're not one of us.

61
00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:57.016
You're here. How was your holiday?

62
00:03:57.516 --> 00:03:59.685
Can I talk to you for a second?

63
00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:02.155
Can it wait? I have to make an urgent call.

64
00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:13.025
You seem upset.

65
00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:18.665
- Or scared. - Excuse me?

66
00:04:19.006 --> 00:04:21.905
What are you so scared of? Losing him?

67
00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:23.746
Doctor Kim.

68
00:04:25.045 --> 00:04:26.206
Or...

69
00:04:28.076 --> 00:04:29.376
is it because he might find out?

70
00:04:30.116 --> 00:04:31.985
What do you mean?

71
00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:34.116
What do you think I meant?

72
00:05:05.116 --> 00:05:08.116
The person you're trying to reach is not available.

73
00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:11.985
What if something really happened to them?

74
00:05:17.126 --> 00:05:18.626
I'm so scared!

75
00:05:23.165 --> 00:05:24.266
Go kill them!

76
00:05:32.176 --> 00:05:33.215
Kill me!

77
00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:35.176
Leave him alone!

78
00:05:35.946 --> 00:05:37.045
What do you want?

79
00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.016
I'll kill you all!

80
00:05:39.816 --> 00:05:41.956
Kill me! Come on!

81
00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:44.056
What will you do?

82
00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:45.155
Oh dear.

83
00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:49.426
You stay here. I'll go and get them.

84
00:05:49.826 --> 00:05:51.366
You can't do that.

85
00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:55.636
They'll be the death of me.

86
00:05:56.035 --> 00:05:58.035
Did they all pass out?

87
00:06:10.045 --> 00:06:11.186
Hello.

88
00:06:12.886 --> 00:06:14.155
Sit up straight.

89
00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:16.525
Eyes downward. Don't you dare look straight at her.

90
00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:17.556
Mr. Yang.

91
00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:19.585
What are you doing?

92
00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:21.525
You see, these fools...

93
00:06:21.525 --> 00:06:23.566
Do you think it's okay to beat people up?

94
00:06:24.126 --> 00:06:25.196
What?

95
00:06:28.636 --> 00:06:30.165
(Errands, Loans)

96
00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:31.835
(October Loans)

97
00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:34.936
Nothing's broken. Just a few bruises.

98
00:06:35.105 --> 00:06:37.006
You'll heal in two weeks.

99
00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:38.806
Thank you.

100
00:06:39.006 --> 00:06:41.915
You're treating the fools who tried to hurt you.

101
00:06:42.176 --> 00:06:44.746
Our big sister's heart is as big as the ocean.

102
00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:48.355
I'd really wanted to ask you something.

103
00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:50.525
Are you really older than him?

104
00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:54.456
I can't help but think that you're younger.

105
00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.496
Right.

106
00:06:55.496 --> 00:06:57.366
- Chil Goo. - Yes, sir.

107
00:06:57.866 --> 00:06:58.926
I should just...

108
00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:02.266
You know,

109
00:07:02.636 --> 00:07:04.335
I respect her with all my heart.

110
00:07:04.766 --> 00:07:06.735
Age is not an issue.

111
00:07:07.876 --> 00:07:09.775
Since the day she reattached his hand,

112
00:07:09.775 --> 00:07:11.345
she's become our big sister.

113
00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:13.275
That's right.

114
00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:14.576
Right, big sis?

115
00:07:14.576 --> 00:07:16.816
- Stop chatting, and put these on. - Okay.

116
00:07:17.116 --> 00:07:18.186
Next.

117
00:07:21.556 --> 00:07:22.616
Did you see that?

118
00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:24.256
Even I obey her.

119
00:07:24.626 --> 00:07:26.225
She's really tough.

120
00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:28.525
That's why...

121
00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:32.225
you need to redo your calculations.

122
00:07:32.725 --> 00:07:33.895
My calculations?

123
00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:38.866
Go on in.

124
00:07:42.436 --> 00:07:44.405
Welcome.

125
00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.006
Sit.

126
00:07:46.915 --> 00:07:49.345
Shall we have a look?

127
00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:52.845
The principal is 40,000 dollars, and the interest is...

128
00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:54.186
100,000 dollars?

129
00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:55.215
That's right.

130
00:07:55.215 --> 00:07:57.686
Oh dear. Do you want all that back?

131
00:07:58.355 --> 00:08:00.295
This loan went to China two years ago.

132
00:08:00.525 --> 00:08:03.025
I know the borrower, so I gave him a discount...

133
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:05.025
Come on now, Chil Goo.

134
00:08:05.025 --> 00:08:06.395
There's no way he'll pay me.

135
00:08:06.835 --> 00:08:07.866
Right?

136
00:08:08.965 --> 00:08:10.706
Let's have another look.

137
00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:13.206
Doctor Song's interest in arrears is...

138
00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:16.676
She paid back 10,000 dollars already.

139
00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:19.816
It says here her dad sent 5,000 dollars too.

140
00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:21.275
Let's deduct all that.

141
00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:24.215
That leaves 25,000 dollars.

142
00:08:24.446 --> 00:08:25.915
No. 40,000 dollars.

143
00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:27.886
- Just the principal. - 20,000.

144
00:08:28.085 --> 00:08:29.155
I can't do that.

145
00:08:29.155 --> 00:08:32.156
Hitting someone isn't the only kind of violence.

146
00:08:32.585 --> 00:08:34.056
What did you say to her?

147
00:08:34.196 --> 00:08:35.595
That she should sell an organ?

148
00:08:35.926 --> 00:08:37.666
That's violence too.

149
00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:41.495
She could sue him for psychological damage as well.

150
00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:43.806
Don't make her do that.

151
00:08:44.265 --> 00:08:45.806
That's would be too harsh.

152
00:08:46.036 --> 00:08:47.475
Then how about...

153
00:08:48.406 --> 00:08:51.245
- 22,000? - 27,500 dollars.

154
00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:52.546
23,000 then, you jerk.

155
00:08:52.546 --> 00:08:54.546
25,000. That's not a big ask.

156
00:08:55.046 --> 00:08:56.076
- Deal. - What?

157
00:08:58.046 --> 00:08:59.755
Thanks for the great deal.

158
00:08:59.885 --> 00:09:01.255
There's no taking back.

159
00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:32.946
Okay.

160
00:09:33.215 --> 00:09:34.355
Take care.

161
00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.656
Who was it? Doctor Song?

162
00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:41.696
It worked out.

163
00:09:42.026 --> 00:09:44.095
- They're on their way back. - Great.

164
00:09:46.796 --> 00:09:48.735
What? Do you want to talk?

165
00:09:49.436 --> 00:09:51.865
Yes. We need to sort things out.

166
00:09:52.206 --> 00:09:54.806
- How do you mean? - Can I claim Doctor Song?

167
00:09:56.105 --> 00:09:58.345
You've been spending a lot of time with Ms. Choi.

168
00:09:58.605 --> 00:10:01.115
- Aren't you back together? - We aren't.

169
00:10:01.115 --> 00:10:03.615
- Then why are you always together? - That's because...

170
00:10:04.715 --> 00:10:05.715
Why won't you answer?

171
00:10:05.885 --> 00:10:08.456
You can't divulge your patient's condition?

172
00:10:08.916 --> 00:10:09.985
What do you mean?

173
00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:12.526
Ms. Choi went to Seoul because she was sick.

174
00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:14.956
Ever since then, your desk...

175
00:10:16.965 --> 00:10:18.225
was cluttered with papers.

176
00:10:25.605 --> 00:10:27.076
Does she have leukemia?

177
00:10:29.176 --> 00:10:30.576
What are you offering?

178
00:10:30.975 --> 00:10:32.806
Treatment? Pity?

179
00:10:33.546 --> 00:10:34.615
Love?

180
00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.845
- All three? - Jae Geol.

181
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.115
What? Do you want to say no?

182
00:10:40.186 --> 00:10:42.156
Then you should've gotten her another doctor.

183
00:10:42.686 --> 00:10:44.426
Even if your ex is dying,

184
00:10:44.426 --> 00:10:46.396
you can't do this if you don't feel anything.

185
00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:48.625
You still have feelings for her...

186
00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:49.826
She's my patient.

187
00:10:51.166 --> 00:10:52.426
Nothing more than that.

188
00:10:57.036 --> 00:10:58.536
What about Doctor Song, then?

189
00:11:00.135 --> 00:11:01.635
No relationship there either?

190
00:11:03.676 --> 00:11:05.505
She might think so,

191
00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:07.046
- but... - But what?

192
00:11:10.946 --> 00:11:12.085
I feel differently.

193
00:11:14.156 --> 00:11:15.255
You like her?

194
00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:20.095
Let's not turn it into a joke by saying...

195
00:11:20.456 --> 00:11:21.855
it needs to be sorted out.

196
00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:27.566
Who said it's a joke?

197
00:11:29.835 --> 00:11:31.835
You said Doctor Song thinks there's nothing between you two.

198
00:11:32.265 --> 00:11:34.475
- Don't I have a shot, then? - Jae Geol.

199
00:11:34.475 --> 00:11:36.406
If I do, I don't want to give it up.

200
00:11:37.676 --> 00:11:38.946
You know the reason why...

201
00:11:39.975 --> 00:11:40.975
I can't do that.

202
00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:45.985
Just how great a woman Doctor Song is...

203
00:11:49.255 --> 00:11:51.956
is something you know better than I do for now.

204
00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:07.536
(New message)

205
00:12:07.536 --> 00:12:10.375
Schedule for treatment is ready. Bring patient to hospital.

206
00:12:16.686 --> 00:12:18.686
Doctor, this is Kwak Hyun.

207
00:12:19.786 --> 00:12:20.816
Yes.

208
00:12:21.355 --> 00:12:23.985
I'd like to make a suggestion regarding Young Eun's treatment.

209
00:12:31.595 --> 00:12:33.026
What are you so scared of?

210
00:12:33.465 --> 00:12:34.495
Losing him?

211
00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:36.335
- Doctor Kim. - Or...

212
00:12:38.605 --> 00:12:39.635
is it because he might find out?

213
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.215
What?

214
00:12:52.015 --> 00:12:53.085
Is something wrong?

215
00:12:55.456 --> 00:12:57.686
No. Nothing's wrong.

216
00:12:58.385 --> 00:13:01.556
It's just that things aren't quite working out.

217
00:13:03.526 --> 00:13:05.125
It happens when you're sick.

218
00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:08.865
Doctor Go texted me.

219
00:13:09.566 --> 00:13:11.206
Your treatment schedule's out.

220
00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:14.235
I don't work tomorrow.

221
00:13:15.005 --> 00:13:16.005
I'll take you.

222
00:13:17.906 --> 00:13:18.975
Must I...

223
00:13:19.975 --> 00:13:21.015
go?

224
00:13:21.546 --> 00:13:22.546
Ms. Choi.

225
00:13:22.776 --> 00:13:27.015
Okay. I'll go. I will.

226
00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:29.316
Don't be scared.

227
00:13:29.826 --> 00:13:30.885
It'll be fine.

228
00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:44.166
The slave hunters are back!

229
00:13:45.505 --> 00:13:47.676
Mr. Chu, are you all right?

230
00:13:47.676 --> 00:13:51.046
Choon Ho did something great.

231
00:13:51.046 --> 00:13:52.845
It was nothing.

232
00:13:52.845 --> 00:13:54.015
Tomorrow's a Saturday.

233
00:13:54.515 --> 00:13:55.546
Let's have soju.

234
00:13:55.546 --> 00:13:56.546
You'll pay?

235
00:13:56.546 --> 00:13:59.286
- Soju's so cheap. - Then what?

236
00:13:59.646 --> 00:14:01.515
- And beer. - And pork belly.

237
00:14:01.615 --> 00:14:03.556
- Deal. - Hooray.

238
00:14:03.826 --> 00:14:05.326
What about us, doctor?

239
00:14:05.326 --> 00:14:08.056
Of course, she'd invite you too.

240
00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.595
We're all invited.

241
00:14:09.595 --> 00:14:12.426
Yes, let's celebrate. My treat.

242
00:14:14.536 --> 00:14:15.965
This is great.

243
00:14:16.436 --> 00:14:19.166
We owe all this to Mr. Yang, don't we?

244
00:14:19.505 --> 00:14:20.505
Absolutely.

245
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:24.605
You're so cool. You're a true man.

246
00:14:24.605 --> 00:14:27.546
I'd rather you not call me that. I'm embarrassed now.

247
00:14:28.245 --> 00:14:30.115
A manly man.

248
00:14:30.115 --> 00:14:31.186
Oh, right.

249
00:14:31.345 --> 00:14:32.985
I have a good idea.

250
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:36.985
Get back to work. You can't all stay here.

251
00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:38.526
Come on, people.

252
00:14:38.526 --> 00:14:40.556
- That's right. Work. - Come along.

253
00:14:40.556 --> 00:14:43.095
We have some cleaning up to do.

254
00:14:43.725 --> 00:14:45.426
Choon Ho, get some rest.

255
00:14:50.906 --> 00:14:52.605
He doesn't know yet.

256
00:14:53.406 --> 00:14:55.635
That's why he mentioned a treatment schedule.

257
00:14:56.446 --> 00:14:58.646
If she told the Korean Medicine doctor,

258
00:14:58.646 --> 00:15:01.845
it's a matter of time before she tells Hyun.

259
00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.585
Jeong Rim, I'll call you back.

260
00:15:09.286 --> 00:15:10.326
Was it you?

261
00:15:14.426 --> 00:15:16.426
Did you tell the Korean Medicine doctor?

262
00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:19.396
- Tell him what? - You know what I mean.

263
00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:23.965
So it's true.

264
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:26.576
Believe it or not, I didn't tell him.

265
00:15:27.306 --> 00:15:30.576
- He happened to find out. - What do you mean?

266
00:15:30.745 --> 00:15:33.245
I think he overheard us in the room next door.

267
00:15:34.845 --> 00:15:37.286
- Should I believe that? - It's the truth.

268
00:15:38.385 --> 00:15:40.115
If you're that anxious, why did you do it?

269
00:15:41.515 --> 00:15:44.556
It's not too late. Tell Dr. Kwak...

270
00:15:44.556 --> 00:15:45.826
Tell him what?

271
00:15:46.456 --> 00:15:49.796
Tell him everything so that I ruin myself?

272
00:15:50.026 --> 00:15:52.125
Why would I do that?

273
00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:55.995
Keep Dr. Kim under control, and stay out of my business.

274
00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:12.251
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 25 Hospital Ship "Big Sister"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

275
00:16:23.296 --> 00:16:25.566
Why did you do that to Ms. Choi?

276
00:16:25.566 --> 00:16:28.536
I scared her to give her a hard time.

277
00:16:28.635 --> 00:16:29.635
Dr. Kim.

278
00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:32.505
As I said, I like to play fair.

279
00:16:33.206 --> 00:16:36.446
If I start with more advantage than Dr. Kwak,

280
00:16:37.776 --> 00:16:39.206
it's not fun.

281
00:16:40.816 --> 00:16:43.885
You should go unless you want acupuncture. I'm studying.

282
00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:46.416
Do you have time today?

283
00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:50.426
Want to eat dinner together?

284
00:16:51.926 --> 00:16:54.826
- That sounds good. - You can pick the restaurant.

285
00:16:54.826 --> 00:16:56.465
I don't know any.

286
00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:23.126
(Ji Eun)

287
00:17:24.856 --> 00:17:26.285
Hello, Ji Eun.

288
00:17:26.285 --> 00:17:28.196
Are you coming this weekend?

289
00:17:28.755 --> 00:17:31.765
- This weekend? - Did you forget already?

290
00:17:31.765 --> 00:17:34.535
You're supposed to get your suit tailored for my engagement.

291
00:17:34.535 --> 00:17:37.866
Seung Won's trying his on that day, so we can all eat together.

292
00:17:37.866 --> 00:17:41.005
What will you do about Dad?

293
00:17:43.606 --> 00:17:45.406
Stay here.

294
00:17:45.406 --> 00:17:48.475
My brother is at the hospital ship, so I can't hear him well.

295
00:17:48.575 --> 00:17:50.616
- Okay, see you soon. - Okay.

296
00:17:56.015 --> 00:17:58.285
Why are you bringing up Dad?

297
00:17:58.285 --> 00:18:00.825
Tell his family about our dad and introduce him.

298
00:18:01.626 --> 00:18:03.866
- Hyun. - Let's do that.

299
00:18:03.866 --> 00:18:05.265
Don't you dare.

300
00:18:05.265 --> 00:18:07.336
I'll cancel the wedding.

301
00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.235
Then I'll kill myself.

302
00:18:11.836 --> 00:18:13.735
Is there a problem?

303
00:18:14.336 --> 00:18:16.676
No, not at all.

304
00:18:16.676 --> 00:18:19.606
Then why do you look so serious?

305
00:18:19.815 --> 00:18:23.045
He won't get his suit tailored since he's too busy.

306
00:18:24.946 --> 00:18:26.755
Men can be like that.

307
00:18:26.755 --> 00:18:28.956
Don't be so sensitive.

308
00:18:28.956 --> 00:18:30.626
Still...

309
00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:33.126
Let's go. I'll buy you something delicious.

310
00:18:33.525 --> 00:18:36.156
I need to get back to work after lunch.

311
00:18:36.725 --> 00:18:37.896
Let's go.

312
00:18:55.846 --> 00:18:58.886
The hospital ship has an announcement to make.

313
00:18:58.886 --> 00:19:01.156
At the hospital ship today,

314
00:19:01.156 --> 00:19:04.285
there will be flu vaccination.

315
00:19:04.285 --> 00:19:06.186
Please come,

316
00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:11.396
and make sure to get your flu shot.

317
00:19:11.495 --> 00:19:14.035
I'll repeat the announcement.

318
00:19:14.035 --> 00:19:16.565
Brace yourselves today.

319
00:19:16.565 --> 00:19:19.136
When we provide flu vaccination for free,

320
00:19:19.235 --> 00:19:22.136
the hospital gets extremely crowded.

321
00:19:22.136 --> 00:19:24.106
- I'm scared. - Me too.

322
00:19:24.106 --> 00:19:26.475
All right, let's go.

323
00:19:38.586 --> 00:19:40.495
Isn't that Geun Ja?

324
00:19:40.495 --> 00:19:43.626
Is she picking vegetables today?

325
00:19:44.295 --> 00:19:46.495
She's so peculiar.

326
00:19:46.596 --> 00:19:49.166
What is she wearing while picking vegetables?

327
00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:52.065
Give her a break. She's from Seoul.

328
00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:53.706
No, she isn't.

329
00:19:53.706 --> 00:19:55.676
Be nice to her.

330
00:19:55.676 --> 00:19:57.505
She hasn't been back home in a long time.

331
00:19:58.706 --> 00:20:01.275
Hey, Geun Ja.

332
00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:02.846
"Geun Ja"?

333
00:20:09.116 --> 00:20:11.825
Geun Ja, are you picking vegetables?

334
00:20:11.825 --> 00:20:14.725
My name is Geun Hee, not Geun Ja.

335
00:20:15.295 --> 00:20:18.025
I changed my name a long time ago. Don't call me Geun Ja.

336
00:20:18.025 --> 00:20:20.965
- What's the difference? - What?

337
00:20:22.265 --> 00:20:25.206
When did you arrive? Did you come alone?

338
00:20:25.206 --> 00:20:26.606
Of course, I came alone.

339
00:20:27.505 --> 00:20:30.706
Why? Your mom was waiting for you.

340
00:20:30.906 --> 00:20:34.245
Why didn't you bring your husband and son?

341
00:20:34.876 --> 00:20:36.946
Why would they come here?

342
00:20:37.045 --> 00:20:39.015
Don't you know that life in Seoul is busy?

343
00:20:39.616 --> 00:20:41.656
Gosh, I forgot.

344
00:20:41.656 --> 00:20:44.285
You spent your whole life in the countryside.

345
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:45.626
How would you know?

346
00:20:45.626 --> 00:20:48.325
- What did you say? How dare you? - Gosh.

347
00:20:48.325 --> 00:20:50.426
Stop it.

348
00:20:50.795 --> 00:20:53.596
We aren't children anymore.

349
00:20:54.035 --> 00:20:56.906
I'm turning 60 soon.

350
00:20:56.906 --> 00:20:59.065
Didn't you see how aggressive she was?

351
00:20:59.065 --> 00:21:00.876
You started it by bragging.

352
00:21:00.876 --> 00:21:02.406
That's enough!

353
00:21:05.376 --> 00:21:09.846
Both of you should come to my house tonight.

354
00:21:10.515 --> 00:21:11.815
What's going on?

355
00:21:12.416 --> 00:21:14.815
Makgeolli aged really well.

356
00:21:14.916 --> 00:21:19.426
You used to love makgeolli that I made at home.

357
00:21:19.426 --> 00:21:20.626
I did?

358
00:21:20.626 --> 00:21:23.265
Of course. Don't you remember?

359
00:21:23.265 --> 00:21:24.965
After drinking it with sugar,

360
00:21:24.965 --> 00:21:27.465
you cried and got completely drunk.

361
00:21:29.805 --> 00:21:31.235
When did I do that?

362
00:21:32.366 --> 00:21:33.575
You'll come, right?

363
00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:41.045
No, thanks. I don't drink much these days.

364
00:21:41.575 --> 00:21:45.646
All I drink is some wine when I can't fall asleep.

365
00:21:46.045 --> 00:21:48.215
What? What did you say?

366
00:21:48.686 --> 00:21:51.525
Don't you know what wine is?

367
00:21:52.386 --> 00:21:54.196
Forget about drinking.

368
00:21:54.295 --> 00:21:56.596
She gave me bad luck before I went diving.

369
00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:07.005
Hurry up. Aren't you going to dive?

370
00:22:07.906 --> 00:22:10.275
My goodness.

371
00:22:12.275 --> 00:22:13.646
Come tonight.

372
00:22:14.116 --> 00:22:17.916
I'll keep a bottle for you.

373
00:22:38.235 --> 00:22:41.376
Aren't we going to the hospital ship for the vaccination?

374
00:22:41.376 --> 00:22:43.676
We can't dive after getting a flu shot.

375
00:22:43.676 --> 00:22:45.406
- You're such a hick. - What?

376
00:23:02.926 --> 00:23:05.065
Mom, I'm home.

377
00:23:06.196 --> 00:23:08.366
You like these vegetables, don't you?

378
00:23:08.366 --> 00:23:10.735
I'll cook them for you.

379
00:24:02.586 --> 00:24:06.025
They cried because they were so scared.

380
00:24:06.025 --> 00:24:08.255
- Is it my turn? - Come this way.

381
00:24:08.255 --> 00:24:10.926
Let's get vaccinated.

382
00:24:10.926 --> 00:24:13.596
- See you later. - Good luck.

383
00:24:13.596 --> 00:24:16.465
It shouldn't be too bad.

384
00:24:16.465 --> 00:24:17.866
Is it my turn?

385
00:24:17.866 --> 00:24:20.336
- Are your children healthy? - Yes.

386
00:24:22.305 --> 00:24:23.846
I'll listen to your breathing.

387
00:24:30.515 --> 00:24:32.646
- What's the temperature? - 36.5°C.

388
00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:35.086
- Everything looks good. - Is that so?

389
00:24:35.086 --> 00:24:36.555
You may get vaccinated.

390
00:24:36.856 --> 00:24:39.896
- Follow me to the injection room. - Goodbye.

391
00:24:42.626 --> 00:24:46.065
Hello, sir. The shot won't hurt at all.

392
00:24:51.606 --> 00:24:54.936
- Nurse Pyo, flu shot, please. - Okay.

393
00:24:56.606 --> 00:24:58.206
Press it down hard.

394
00:24:58.305 --> 00:25:01.515
Take off your jacket, and pull up your sleeve.

395
00:25:01.515 --> 00:25:03.515
- Is that so? - Yes.

396
00:25:03.515 --> 00:25:06.616
Next is Heo Geun Hee.

397
00:25:06.616 --> 00:25:09.055
- Yes. - Go to the doctor's office.

398
00:25:13.055 --> 00:25:16.666
- Please have a seat. - Hello.

399
00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:22.136
(Blood test results)

400
00:25:24.235 --> 00:25:25.535
Are you here for the vaccination?

401
00:25:26.005 --> 00:25:27.936
It was you.

402
00:25:28.275 --> 00:25:29.336
I'm sorry?

403
00:25:29.336 --> 00:25:33.045
You have my mom's name, Mo Mak Jeom, on that piece of paper.

404
00:25:33.475 --> 00:25:35.446
You're her daughter.

405
00:25:36.116 --> 00:25:37.946
Whenever we talk on the phone,

406
00:25:37.946 --> 00:25:40.416
she won't stop saying good things about you.

407
00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:42.416
I always wanted to meet you.

408
00:25:43.015 --> 00:25:46.055
She hurt her hip joint. How is she doing?

409
00:25:47.825 --> 00:25:50.866
She won't be able to move around for a while.

410
00:25:51.325 --> 00:25:54.096
Change her position often to prevent bedsores.

411
00:25:54.565 --> 00:25:57.735
I'll give you some enemas as well.

412
00:25:57.936 --> 00:25:59.235
She likes dried persimmons,

413
00:25:59.235 --> 00:26:01.176
so she has bad constipation.

414
00:26:02.136 --> 00:26:05.646
Gosh, you know so much about her.

415
00:26:05.646 --> 00:26:09.245
You're much better than her own son or grandson.

416
00:26:09.886 --> 00:26:11.646
No, not at all.

417
00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:15.255
Are you feeling okay? Your hands are very hot.

418
00:26:16.686 --> 00:26:18.255
Oh, I almost forgot why I was here.

419
00:26:18.255 --> 00:26:20.856
I've done all kinds of chores since I got here,

420
00:26:20.856 --> 00:26:22.555
so I must've caught a cold.

421
00:26:22.555 --> 00:26:26.325
I have a fever and chills.

422
00:26:26.896 --> 00:26:29.065
- Take her body temperature first. - Okay.

423
00:26:32.866 --> 00:26:34.906
- Let me take your body temperature. - Sure.

424
00:26:38.206 --> 00:26:39.975
It's 37.3℃.

425
00:26:41.376 --> 00:26:43.985
You have a mild fever. When did it start?

426
00:26:45.545 --> 00:26:48.015
I think I've had it for about 3 to 4 days.

427
00:26:48.015 --> 00:26:49.215
What about other symptoms?

428
00:26:49.215 --> 00:26:51.725
Have you had a cough, a runny nose, or phlegm as well?

429
00:26:52.225 --> 00:26:54.926
I've been coughing a little.

430
00:26:55.356 --> 00:26:58.325
What about when you swallow your saliva? Does it hurt?

431
00:27:00.465 --> 00:27:02.096
- Just a little. - I see.

432
00:27:03.206 --> 00:27:05.235
- Please open up. - Okay.

433
00:27:10.446 --> 00:27:12.346
Your throat doesn't look so swollen.

434
00:27:13.146 --> 00:27:14.815
Let me listen to your chest.

435
00:27:15.646 --> 00:27:17.315
Excuse me.

436
00:27:26.225 --> 00:27:28.126
- Please turn around. - Okay.

437
00:27:29.965 --> 00:27:32.626
- Take a deep breath. - Okay.

438
00:27:34.936 --> 00:27:36.505
One more time, please.

439
00:27:40.505 --> 00:27:42.275
Your breathing is not bad either.

440
00:27:42.975 --> 00:27:45.475
For now, I think you're showing early symptoms of a cold.

441
00:27:45.805 --> 00:27:47.245
Take the medicine for a few days.

442
00:27:47.245 --> 00:27:49.545
If you still have a fever and feel the same,

443
00:27:49.545 --> 00:27:50.916
please come back.

444
00:27:50.916 --> 00:27:52.846
You can come back here if possible.

445
00:27:52.846 --> 00:27:56.525
If not, please go to a hospital on land.

446
00:27:57.525 --> 00:27:59.225
I'll probably get better before then.

447
00:27:59.686 --> 00:28:00.725
Of course.

448
00:28:02.356 --> 00:28:04.495
- Choon Soon. - Ma'am!

449
00:28:04.495 --> 00:28:06.025
Choon Soon!

450
00:28:06.436 --> 00:28:07.596
Ma'am!

451
00:28:20.916 --> 00:28:23.015
- Ma'am! - Choon Soon!

452
00:28:25.346 --> 00:28:27.656
Choon Soon!

453
00:28:28.055 --> 00:28:29.985
Goodness, Choon Soon!

454
00:28:30.126 --> 00:28:33.055
Oh, gosh. Choon Soon.

455
00:28:33.626 --> 00:28:36.525
What? An accident at sea?

456
00:28:37.366 --> 00:28:39.866
The patient is a diver?

457
00:28:39.866 --> 00:28:41.735
Try to get up.

458
00:28:43.336 --> 00:28:45.706
Oh, my goodness. Do you think you can?

459
00:28:47.906 --> 00:28:50.606
Your arms. Try lifting your arm.

460
00:28:50.775 --> 00:28:52.446
Lift it now!

461
00:28:53.146 --> 00:28:55.616
What about your legs?

462
00:28:55.975 --> 00:28:57.616
Can you lift them?

463
00:29:00.715 --> 00:29:02.315
Not even your legs?

464
00:29:02.886 --> 00:29:05.126
You really can't lift them?

465
00:29:05.956 --> 00:29:07.696
- Oh, dear. - What should we do?

466
00:29:07.696 --> 00:29:11.396
- Choon Soon! - Oh, my goodness.

467
00:29:11.565 --> 00:29:15.396
Choon Soon! Oh, gosh. Choon Soon.

468
00:29:15.396 --> 00:29:19.106
It's very serious. She's completely paralyzed.

469
00:29:19.106 --> 00:29:20.505
Completely paralyzed?

470
00:29:21.775 --> 00:29:24.206
Where are you right now?

471
00:29:25.245 --> 00:29:27.045
Oh, is it nearby?

472
00:29:27.045 --> 00:29:28.916
Okay. I got it.

473
00:29:31.586 --> 00:29:36.725
We have an emergency patient.

474
00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:43.025
Yes. Okay, we will.

475
00:29:43.866 --> 00:29:46.265
The patient's name is Baek Choon Soon. A 58-year-old female.

476
00:29:46.265 --> 00:29:47.795
She's a diver,

477
00:29:47.795 --> 00:29:49.596
but there was a problem while floating.

478
00:29:49.596 --> 00:29:51.035
She's completely paralyzed now.

479
00:29:51.035 --> 00:29:53.106
- Is the Coast Guard coming? - In 30 minutes.

480
00:29:53.106 --> 00:29:54.176
Let's go.

481
00:30:08.616 --> 00:30:10.755
Doctors! It's this way!

482
00:30:11.686 --> 00:30:13.926
Ma'am. Can you tell me your name?

483
00:30:14.225 --> 00:30:15.356
Ma'am.

484
00:30:18.065 --> 00:30:19.166
Ma'am.

485
00:30:25.903 --> 00:30:27.903
(Episode 26 will air shortly.)
