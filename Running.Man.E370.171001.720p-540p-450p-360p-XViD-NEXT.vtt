(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

2
00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:17.337
(Those with 3 I Go Stickers must travel with another member.)

3
00:00:17.337 --> 00:00:22.709
(Haha and So Min were chosen to receive a penalty.)

4
00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:25.712
(So Min's destination is...)

5
00:00:25.712 --> 00:00:28.181
(Indonesia Manual Wooden Cable Car.)

6
00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:34.187
(So Min's partner is Kwang Soo, the penalty maniac.)

7
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:37.357
(The day finally came.)

8
00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:42.629
(Kwang Soo and So Min leave to receive the penalty.)

9
00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.800
(Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour started.)

10
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.270
(The only money they got was the allowance from the members.)

11
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.210
(They had to pick envelopes that seem to contain a lot of money.)

12
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.646
(Kwang Soo picked Jong Kook, Seok Jin, and Jae Seok's envelopes.)

13
00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:01.881
(So Min picked Haha, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan's envelopes.)

14

(Kwang Soo received 96 dollars and So Min received 54 dollars.)

15
00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:11.458
(Let's see you in Indonesia for Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour.)

16
00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:16.529
(They finally go to their destination.)

17
00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:22.535
(A steep cliff and violent waves)

18
00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:28.174
(The riders must fight against the waves on a wooden cable car.)

19
00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:31.778

(Find the one who is speaking the truth.)

22
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.993
(The fierce battle for the truth between the tiger moths starts now.)

23
00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:51.164
(It's an autumn day that contains the abundance of Chuseok.)

24
00:01:51.564 --> 00:01:53.199
- Hello. - Hello.

25
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:56.369
- Hello. - Hello.

26
00:01:56.703 --> 00:01:58.705
- What is this? - Hello.

27
00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:00.073
Hello.

28
00:02:00.173 --> 00:02:01.174
What is this?

29
00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:05.512
This must be a historic site.

30
00:02:05.512 --> 00:02:07.547
(C rest stop has a statue of a Goguryeo warrior on a horse.)

31
00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:08.782
Is that Genghis Khan?

32
00:02:08.782 --> 00:02:09.916
(Does he think he is in Mongolia?)

33
00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:11.451
Genghis Khan?

34
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:13.553
- Why would Genghis Khan be here? - Seriously.

35
00:02:13.553 --> 00:02:15.688
Why would Genghis Khan be here?

36
00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:17.457
I see.

37
00:02:17.457 --> 00:02:18.892
It looks like a statue of an unknown warrior.

38
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.796
We need to take a look at Haha's outfit.

39
00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:25.265
(The statue isn't the only thing we need to take a look at.)

40
00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:27.567
(He is armed with an outfit of bright colors.)

41
00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:28.935
Everyone was laughing when he came in.

42
00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.206
(The fashionista who spreads hipness in North Chungcheong Province, Haha)

43
00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:35.008
He is wearing Lee Deok Hwa's clothes again.

44
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:36.309
I burst out laughing as soon as I saw him.

45
00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:39.546
(He is wearing Lee Deok Hwa's clothes again.)

46
00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:41.781
It's morning soccer league fashion.

47
00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:43.316
Chris Brown.

48
00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:44.918
- What? - Chris Brown.

49
00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:46.820
- For goodness' sake. - Be quiet and eat brownie.

50
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.122
- Chris Brown, my foot. - He doesn't dress like that.

51
00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:51.558
- You have toothpaste on your shirt. - Where?

52
00:02:51.558 --> 00:02:53.726
(You should worry about yourself.)

53
00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:55.028
Really?

54
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:56.095
- Where? - Really?

55
00:02:56.095 --> 00:02:57.730
- It's all over the shirt. - He wears it at home,

56
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.567
at a shoot, when he sleeps, and when he works out.

57
00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:03.303
He is well-known for not having a lot of clothes.

58
00:03:03.303 --> 00:03:05.505
- Listen. - I should buy him clothes.

59
00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:09.142
I really have multiple sets of the same items.

60
00:03:09.142 --> 00:03:10.143
- I plan to post a picture of them. - I see.

61
00:03:10.143 --> 00:03:14.247
After the late Steve Jobs...

62
00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:16.449
(He only wears black clothes.)

63
00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:17.617
- He is incredible. - It's comfortable.

64
00:03:17.617 --> 00:03:19.052
- You should post a picture. - It's comfortable.

65
00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:20.887
- He only wears one outfit. - His fashion never changes.

66
00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:23.256
- It's comfortable. - He only wears one outfit.

67
00:03:23.423 --> 00:03:26.826
So Min wants people to talk about her outfit, too.

68
00:03:26.893 --> 00:03:29.062
- No, I don't. - Her outfit matches Jae Seok's.

69
00:03:29.062 --> 00:03:30.630
You should pull down your pants a little.

70
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.265
- Look at her pants. - Seriously.

71
00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:33.967
- You pulled up your pants too high. - Listen.

72
00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:36.736
Don't say such things to So Min.

73
00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:37.904
- Why not? - So Min will find it funny.

74
00:03:37.904 --> 00:03:39.839
- She will pull up her pants higher. - That's right.

75
00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.241
- She will pull up her pants higher. - That's right.

76
00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:42.275
She will pull them up to her chest.

77
00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:44.010
She will wear them as a top.

78
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.011
She will pull them up to here.

79
00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:46.746
She takes things to extremes.

80
00:03:47.146 --> 00:03:48.915
These pants come with suspenders.

81
00:03:48.915 --> 00:03:49.916
My goodness.

82
00:03:50.116 --> 00:03:51.818
Kwang Soo got his hair cut.

83
00:03:51.818 --> 00:03:53.052
I got my hair cut.

84
00:03:53.052 --> 00:03:55.221
- It's refreshing to look at. - He looks like a human being now.

85
00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:56.289
A haircut is necessary.

86
00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.425
People said a haircut will make him look better, but he looks the same.

87
00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:00.426
(He looks the same.)

88
00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:02.829
You say that because you are used to my changing styles.

89
00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.099
Didn't Ahn Jung Hwan have that hairstyle in 2002?

90
00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.701
- The windswept hairstyle. - What are you talking about?

91
00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:10.537
What are you doing?

92
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:14.207
(He tries a kiss on the ring.)

93
00:04:14.207 --> 00:04:15.174
All right.

94
00:04:15.174 --> 00:04:17.777
(The producer cuts them off.)

95
00:04:18.144 --> 00:04:20.079
He knows when to cut us off.

96
00:04:20.647 --> 00:04:22.348
- That was clean. - He knows we are out of ideas.

97
00:04:22.348 --> 00:04:24.817
- "All right." - It's time to move on.

98
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:28.922
We have an announcement to make before the start of the race.

99
00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:30.290
- Okay. - My goodness.

100
00:04:30.557 --> 00:04:32.525
Similar to So Min and Kwang Soo,

101
00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.794
Haha and Se Chan had planned...

102
00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:38.231
to go to Giant Canyon Swing to carry out their penalty.

103
00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:43.336
(They were supposed to go to Giant Canyon Swing in September.)

104
00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:44.337
Why aren't they going?

105
00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:47.240
Due to complications,

106
00:04:47.807 --> 00:04:50.043
the media visa is getting delayed.

107
00:04:50.043 --> 00:04:51.411
They don't have the media visa yet.

108
00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:53.746
Before the end of this year...

109
00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:54.914
- Our penalty is gone. - Nice!

110
00:04:54.914 --> 00:04:55.915
- Yes! - Really?

111
00:04:56.015 --> 00:04:58.117
- Let's pass! - That's complete nonsense.

112
00:04:58.117 --> 00:04:59.719
- There is no way we can go. - Can a penalty go away like that?

113
00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.821
- Look for something in Korea. - It's still valid.

114
00:05:02.188 --> 00:05:04.157
(The situation can't be helped.)

115
00:05:04.157 --> 00:05:06.326
I learned about this...

116
00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:08.161
from "Live Info Show".

117
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:09.829
- The longest zipline... - That's right.

118
00:05:09.996 --> 00:05:11.230
- in Korea was just made. - A zipline.

119
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.700
- Send them over there. - It's the longest zipline in Korea.

120
00:05:15.201 --> 00:05:19.606
(The length of 389m promises to make them forget about the US.)

121
00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:21.341
Why would you watch something like that?

122
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:22.375
Seriously.

123
00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:25.545
- It's incredible. - It's on par with the one in Spain.

124
00:05:25.612 --> 00:05:28.414
You can get a beautiful view of the nature.

125
00:05:28.615 --> 00:05:30.416
Seriously. It will be beautiful.

126
00:05:30.416 --> 00:05:32.185
- It will be incredible. - The view will be beautiful.

127
00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:34.320
- Thank you for a nice input. - All right.

128
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.757
I bet my entire fortune Jae Seok will end up on it.

129
00:05:37.757 --> 00:05:41.160
(I bet my entire fortune Jae Seok will end up on it.)

130
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.729
Seriously. It will happen before this year passes.

131
00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.297
- Hey. - Jae Seok...

132
00:05:44.297 --> 00:05:46.799
Jae Seok will hit his own mouth...

133
00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:48.735
and say that he shouldn't have said anything.

134
00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:50.937
I bet you will sit next to him with your entire fortune.

135
00:05:51.704 --> 00:05:54.641
I bet he will be holding a crocodile.

136
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:57.310
- He will be holding a crocodile. - That's right.

137
00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.514
(Kwang Soo and Jae Seok enjoy the longest zipline in Korea.)

138
00:06:01.514 --> 00:06:03.082
- For goodness' sake. - A crocodile.

139
00:06:03.082 --> 00:06:04.584
That's right.

140
00:06:04.717 --> 00:06:08.287
Anyway, we must complete the penalty before the year passes.

141
00:06:08.287 --> 00:06:09.288
That's right.

142
00:06:09.288 --> 00:06:11.124
That's why we came up with a plan to replace it with another swing.

143
00:06:11.124 --> 00:06:13.126
The original destination was Giant Canyon Swing.

144
00:06:13.526 --> 00:06:15.028
When we visit Australia for Kwang Soo's penalty,

145
00:06:15.028 --> 00:06:17.196
we will visit New Zealand as well.

146
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.666
- That's a good idea. - You will go to New Zealand.

147
00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:22.802
Then they can go on Nevis Swing.

148
00:06:22.802 --> 00:06:26.105
(Let's go to Nevis Swing, the place the crew recommends.)

149
00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:29.342
(It's the biggest swing in the world.)

150
00:06:29.342 --> 00:06:33.546
(It's a destination the members were the wariest of.)

151
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.915
That's a good idea. They always find a way.

152
00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:37.850
- Are you saying we will go on it? - Why?

153
00:06:38.317 --> 00:06:40.820
The zipline that was on "Live Info Show"...

154
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.622
- would be preferable. - Seriously.

155
00:06:42.822 --> 00:06:44.090
Nevis Swing seemed intense.

156
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.325
It sounds like...

157
00:06:46.793 --> 00:06:49.362
we should come to an agreement.

158
00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:51.330
Since it isn't the destination we picked,

159
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.266
we should come to an agreement.

160
00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:55.034
What do you think about the change?

161
00:06:55.034 --> 00:06:56.302
- My head hurts. - They should do it.

162
00:06:56.536 --> 00:06:58.905
As a viewer, I am curious.

163
00:06:58.905 --> 00:07:01.040
The viewers would be upset...

164
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.775
- if they don't hold their promise. - For goodness' sake.

165
00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.244
Those crazy swings should be destroyed.

166
00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:07.547
They must be frustrated.

167
00:07:07.547 --> 00:07:09.182
I am glad I won't be going on that swing.

168
00:07:09.282 --> 00:07:11.918
That place would make a nice alternative, too.

169
00:07:11.918 --> 00:07:14.087
- Which place? - The one from "Live Info Show".

170
00:07:14.087 --> 00:07:15.822
Did you invest in that zipline?

171
00:07:15.822 --> 00:07:17.390
You brought it up so many times.

172
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.125
Isn't it better than Nevis Swing?

173
00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:20.193
It's definitely better.

174
00:07:20.193 --> 00:07:22.428
- It's much better. - You won't have to go abroad.

175
00:07:22.428 --> 00:07:26.532
Would you please let us choose from a few options?

176
00:07:26.532 --> 00:07:28.735
- The one in New Zealand is... - We will look up all the swings.

177
00:07:29.035 --> 00:07:30.470
We will look up all the swings.

178
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.771
There is a swing in Jamsil, too.

179
00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:33.306
Let's move on so that we can relocate to the shade.

180
00:07:33.306 --> 00:07:35.508
(The producer cuts them off.)

181
00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:37.710
Finally, Indonesia Manual Wooden Cable Car...

182
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.911
Is the talk over?

183
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:39.912
Are we really going?

184
00:07:39.912 --> 00:07:41.614
You are really going.

185
00:07:41.614 --> 00:07:43.015
You are going.

186
00:07:43.015 --> 00:07:44.417
(Do we really need to go?)

187
00:07:44.784 --> 00:07:47.487
Since the two countries are close, choosing either of them...

188
00:07:47.487 --> 00:07:50.022
If I choose either of them, the production cost will be reduced.

189
00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:51.724
- The plane tickets. - You are right.

190
00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:53.726
- They can visit the two countries. - That's right.

191
00:07:53.726 --> 00:07:55.695
The three of you should go.

192
00:07:55.828 --> 00:07:57.897
Will one person see crocodiles and ride the swing?

193
00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:00.233
Haha, you are in trouble.

194
00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:02.635
(Am I going as Kwang Soo's plus one?)

195
00:08:02.635 --> 00:08:04.170
You have to see the crocodiles, too.

196
00:08:04.604 --> 00:08:06.038
Why do I need to go?

197
00:08:06.873 --> 00:08:08.107
Seriously.

198
00:08:08.107 --> 00:08:09.876
- It's your penalty. - I get that, but...

199
00:08:09.876 --> 00:08:11.277
I get that it's my penalty, but...

200
00:08:11.277 --> 00:08:12.678
Can I shave my head instead?

201
00:08:12.678 --> 00:08:15.815
(Can I shave my head instead?)

202
00:08:15.815 --> 00:08:17.416
Let's say for now that you are going.

203
00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:19.118
(The producer is resolute.)

204
00:08:19.285 --> 00:08:22.054
He isn't interested in Haha shaving his head.

205
00:08:22.155 --> 00:08:24.257
- I guess he really wants you to go. - Seriously.

206
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:27.426
He isn't interested in Haha shaving his head.

207
00:08:27.426 --> 00:08:28.628
He doesn't care whether he shaves his head...

208
00:08:28.628 --> 00:08:29.996
- or not. - That's right.

209
00:08:29.996 --> 00:08:32.598
He and I can go to Brazil and get Brazilian waxing.

210
00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.167
We can do that.

211
00:08:34.167 --> 00:08:35.168
All right.

212
00:08:35.168 --> 00:08:36.235
(He isn't interested in waxing either.)

213
00:08:36.235 --> 00:08:38.304
- Will it end like this? - All right.

214
00:08:38.304 --> 00:08:41.207
He doesn't care whether you get Brazilian waxing or not.

215
00:08:42.942 --> 00:08:45.711
Not too long ago, Kwang Soo and So Min rode...

216
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:48.614
- Indonesia Manual Wooden Cable Car. - Yes.

217
00:08:48.614 --> 00:08:50.716
(They are done with their penalty.)

218
00:08:50.716 --> 00:08:52.485
How was it, So Min?

219
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.854
What is it?

220
00:08:54.887 --> 00:08:58.090
I survived on the allowances you sent me.

221
00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.091
That's right.

222
00:08:59.091 --> 00:09:00.726
We had a race with that money.

223
00:09:00.726 --> 00:09:03.429
- Really? - I got 100 dollars.

224
00:09:03.429 --> 00:09:04.497
(Their race piques the other members' interest.)

225
00:09:04.497 --> 00:09:06.098
- So Min got 50 dollars. - Really?

226
00:09:06.365 --> 00:09:08.634
All right. So this is the race we have prepared for today.

227
00:09:08.634 --> 00:09:10.436
It's Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game.

228
00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:13.306
(The crew prepared Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game.)

229
00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:15.007
It's Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game.

230
00:09:15.007 --> 00:09:17.577
- Truth or Dare? - I used to host the show back then.

231
00:09:17.777 --> 00:09:19.245
Kwang Soo is good at this game.

232
00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:20.880
I like this game.

233
00:09:21.747 --> 00:09:24.050
This game will be an individual match.

234
00:09:24.116 --> 00:09:26.018
There will be four rounds in total.

235
00:09:26.018 --> 00:09:27.186
- It's an individual match? - Yes.

236
00:09:27.186 --> 00:09:30.489
We will watch the clips from Tiger Moth Tour in Indonesia soon.

237
00:09:30.756 --> 00:09:33.726
Questions of the game will be based on this trip.

238
00:09:33.726 --> 00:09:34.961
(Questions about their trip will be presented.)

239
00:09:34.961 --> 00:09:36.996
Kwang Soo and So Min will read the question...

240
00:09:36.996 --> 00:09:39.031
and choose either one of Truth or False Cards.

241
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:41.534
(Kwang Soo and So Min will choose either one of Truth or False Cards.)

242
00:09:41.534 --> 00:09:44.737
Answer according to your cards, and claim that you're telling the truth.

243
00:09:45.338 --> 00:09:46.439
We have to find out who's telling the truth.

244
00:09:46.439 --> 00:09:48.274
Other members will listen to So Min and Kwang Soo...

245
00:09:48.274 --> 00:09:50.176
and choose the person you think is telling the truth.

246
00:09:50.176 --> 00:09:54.247
(Members must choose who they think is telling the truth.)

247
00:09:54.447 --> 00:09:56.249
Whoever chooses the correct member will be exempted from the penalty.

248
00:09:56.415 --> 00:09:57.817
From what penalty will we be exempted?

249
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.586
Whoever makes the wrong guess will face the penalty...

250
00:10:00.586 --> 00:10:02.455
and receive a penalty badge.

251
00:10:02.455 --> 00:10:03.990
The penalty badge is at stake for every round.

252
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.492
- I see. - It's for every round?

253
00:10:06.492 --> 00:10:09.528
Kwang Soo and So Min. Regardless of the result of the rounds,

254
00:10:09.528 --> 00:10:11.764
you will be exempted if the majority of the members chooses you.

255
00:10:12.098 --> 00:10:14.500
If you aren't chosen by the majority, you'll face the penalty...

256
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.135
and receive the penalty badge.

257
00:10:16.135 --> 00:10:20.406
(Whoever isn't chosen will face the penalty and get the badge.)

258
00:10:20.806 --> 00:10:22.008
After the race,

259
00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:24.677
two members with the most number of penalty badges...

260
00:10:24.677 --> 00:10:27.546
will get to proceed with Chuseok live travel broadcast.

261
00:10:27.546 --> 00:10:31.784
(2 members with most badges must broadcast on Chuseok about traffic.)

262
00:10:32.018 --> 00:10:33.352
Goodness, this is the worst.

263
00:10:33.352 --> 00:10:35.221
- Broadcast on Chuseok? - You want us to do a live show?

264
00:10:35.454 --> 00:10:36.822
You want us to do a live show?

265
00:10:36.822 --> 00:10:38.291
(Are you serious?)

266
00:10:39.025 --> 00:10:44.330
(2 members will deliver a live segment on Chuseok in real life.)

267
00:10:45.231 --> 00:10:46.399
On which date though?

268
00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:47.667
- It will be on October 8. - Sorry?

269
00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:49.201
- October 8? - The 8th?

270
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:51.871
- It's the last Sunday. - The last Sunday of the holidays.

271
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:53.639
- I bet the traffic will be heavy. - The traffic is the worst then.

272
00:10:54.507 --> 00:10:56.275
- I really don't want to do this. - Where will we broadcast?

273
00:10:56.275 --> 00:10:57.510
- 2 of us will do it? - Yes, 2 of you will do it.

274
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.645
- You know how it looks. - Basically, I...

275
00:10:59.645 --> 00:11:03.582
(A man only gazes afar while the announcement is made.)

276
00:11:03.582 --> 00:11:05.084
- He only tells lies. - It's all a lie.

277
00:11:06.285 --> 00:11:08.287
I can't focus on the game today.

278
00:11:08.788 --> 00:11:10.790
He keeps asking me the questions.

279
00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:12.124
"Is it over?"

280
00:11:13.326 --> 00:11:19.598
(I can only think about how I will be on that swing.)

281
00:11:19.765 --> 00:11:23.436
Unless it's hilarious, I don't think I can laugh today. I keep...

282
00:11:23.436 --> 00:11:25.237
- I can see the despair on his face. - You should go and face it then.

283
00:11:25.237 --> 00:11:27.940
You should get on the lane bound for Seoul and go to Seoul.

284
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.642
(You can go home early today.)

285
00:11:29.642 --> 00:11:31.177
Lane bound for Seoul?

286
00:11:32.211 --> 00:11:33.579
You can just head to Gimpo International Airport.

287
00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:35.681
- I must get on it after my work. - I mean it's...

288
00:11:36.015 --> 00:11:39.018
All right. We will begin Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game now.

289
00:11:39.018 --> 00:11:40.319
- All right. - Excuse me.

290
00:11:40.319 --> 00:11:43.422
- I should do my best then. - I must make the correct guesses.

291
00:11:43.422 --> 00:11:44.557
Otherwise, I'll work during the holidays.

292
00:11:44.557 --> 00:11:45.758
- Tell me the rules of the game. - I need to try my best today.

293
00:11:46.158 --> 00:11:47.727
- Everything? - I wasn't paying attention.

294
00:11:47.927 --> 00:11:49.395
This will happen in the morning of the eighth?

295
00:11:50.162 --> 00:11:51.831
We'll end up getting on the Nevis Swing.

296
00:11:51.831 --> 00:11:53.899
(Don't even worry about the game. We'll end up going there.)

297
00:11:56.869 --> 00:11:58.604
This is the 1st round of 4 rounds.

298
00:11:58.604 --> 00:12:00.406
Let the first round of the Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game begin.

299
00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:02.475
We're starting? Gosh, I need to do a good job.

300
00:12:02.475 --> 00:12:04.110
I have to do well today. I'm serious.

301
00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:05.211
To be honest,

302
00:12:05.211 --> 00:12:08.280
- I'm free on the last day. - Right.

303
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.317
But I don't want to come in for work on the last day of the holidays.

304
00:12:11.417 --> 00:12:13.319
- We'll spend at least two hours. - Exactly.

305
00:12:13.319 --> 00:12:16.022
I'm not chosen for the penalties that we have to go abroad because...

306
00:12:16.022 --> 00:12:19.158
I'm not scared and because I actually want to go.

307
00:12:19.158 --> 00:12:21.527
- But I don't want this penalty. - Is that so?

308
00:12:21.527 --> 00:12:23.929
- But I think I might get this. - Why don't you like this penalty?

309
00:12:23.929 --> 00:12:25.598
- What's there to like it? - Why do you say that?

310
00:12:25.598 --> 00:12:28.467
- I have to come in on a day off. - Let's help Jong Kook get this one.

311
00:12:28.467 --> 00:12:30.936
- Because it's not a scary ride? - Right.

312
00:12:30.936 --> 00:12:32.738
- So this is bothersome to him. - He doesn't want to waste his time.

313
00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:34.040
Let me ask this.

314
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.741
What's your plan on the last day of the holidays?

315
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:38.677
(Why don't you want to put aside time on the last day?)

316
00:12:38.677 --> 00:12:40.546
I need to work out.

317
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.715
- I must exercise. - Hold on a minute.

318
00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:46.185
- I have to work out. - You only need to work out.

319
00:12:46.185 --> 00:12:47.820
It's annoying to go back and forth.

320
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.156
But the idea of coming to work on that day is the worst.

321
00:12:50.156 --> 00:12:51.357
- I agree. - But still.

322
00:12:51.357 --> 00:12:54.827
On this round, a meal ticket at the rest stop is at stake.

323
00:12:54.827 --> 00:12:55.861
(1st round of Truth Game)

324
00:12:55.861 --> 00:12:58.597
The member who gets the answer will win a meal ticket.

325
00:12:58.864 --> 00:13:00.466
- The food there is great. - This is amazing.

326
00:13:00.666 --> 00:13:02.802
The member who gets the wrong answer will not be allowed to eat...

327
00:13:02.802 --> 00:13:04.470
and will receive a penalty badge.

328
00:13:05.304 --> 00:13:07.706
We win when we get the majority of the votes, right?

329
00:13:07.706 --> 00:13:08.908
Kwang Soo and So Min.

330
00:13:08.908 --> 00:13:11.811
The one who gets the majority of the votes can eat.

331
00:13:12.711 --> 00:13:15.247
- Or you'll get a penalty badge. - I might not get to eat.

332
00:13:15.247 --> 00:13:18.117
Kwang Soo is terrible at lying, but So Min is just as horrible.

333
00:13:18.117 --> 00:13:21.754
- They easily get flustered. - Besides, they tell small lies.

334
00:13:21.754 --> 00:13:23.155
Our credibility is in the gutter.

335
00:13:23.155 --> 00:13:25.825
I can spot his lies when I observe his face,

336
00:13:25.825 --> 00:13:28.327
- but not So Min. I don't know hers. - I don't know her tell.

337
00:13:28.327 --> 00:13:29.462
- But she gets flustered. - But...

338
00:13:29.462 --> 00:13:31.030
don't you trust me though?

339
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.932
- No way. - What nonsense are you saying?

340
00:13:32.998 --> 00:13:34.100
No, we don't trust you.

341
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.802
So Min tends to tell small lies...

342
00:13:36.802 --> 00:13:38.237
instead of lying about important stuff.

343
00:13:38.337 --> 00:13:39.438
But...

344
00:13:39.438 --> 00:13:41.707
the only thing he does in his life is lie.

345
00:13:41.707 --> 00:13:44.076
How could you? How could you criticize about my life?

346
00:13:44.076 --> 00:13:45.878
- She's not wrong though. - What do you mean...

347
00:13:45.878 --> 00:13:47.012
- by that? - She's right.

348
00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:48.981
His life is filled with lies. It's true.

349
00:13:48.981 --> 00:13:50.616
What do you mean my life is filled with lies?

350
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.619
I'll play the first video of the Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game.

351
00:13:53.619 --> 00:13:55.354
All we have to do is choose, right?

352
00:13:55.354 --> 00:13:57.056
What kind of a clip is this?

353
00:13:57.056 --> 00:13:59.325
It's been a while hosting a show while sitting down.

354
00:13:59.325 --> 00:14:01.127
- While sitting down? - I'm serious.

355
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.529
- We are sitting down. - We're watching clips.

356
00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:05.064
Let me play the clip.

357
00:14:05.064 --> 00:14:06.532
Play the video.

358
00:14:06.532 --> 00:14:08.167
(The video for the 1st round is played.)

359
00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:12.071
(The 1st question of the Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game)

360
00:14:13.105 --> 00:14:14.440
We are really going.

361
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.508
(2 weeks ago, Incheon International Airport)

362
00:14:15.508 --> 00:14:17.576
(We are really going to Indonesia at last.)

363
00:14:17.576 --> 00:14:19.278
- There are so many people here. - I can't believe this is happening.

364
00:14:20.246 --> 00:14:22.581
Am I going to Indonesia or Australia?

365
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.152
There are so many people.

366
00:14:26.552 --> 00:14:28.220
They must be going to Indonesia...

367
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.089
- to receive the penalty. - What are you talking about?

368
00:14:30.489 --> 00:14:31.557
Come to your senses.

369
00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:33.259
You should wash your face on the plane.

370
00:14:37.296 --> 00:14:43.869
(They set out to Yogyakarta which takes 10 hours in total.)

371
00:14:43.869 --> 00:14:45.738
(From Jakarta to Yogyakarta, it takes 1 hour and 20 minutes.)

372
00:14:46.372 --> 00:14:48.007
(9pm, at Adisutjipto International Airport)

373
00:14:48.007 --> 00:14:49.141
- Hey. - Goodness.

374
00:14:49.441 --> 00:14:50.676
This is nice.

375
00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:53.679
(Various cultures coexist in Indonesia.)

376
00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:56.048
- Was that good? - It was so good.

377
00:14:57.216 --> 00:14:59.151
(Noises fill the airport.)

378
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:01.687
- You got to try it? - Kwang Soo surprised me.

379
00:15:01.687 --> 00:15:03.556
- He's the Prince of Asia. - Right.

380
00:15:04.256 --> 00:15:06.659
(Welcome, Prince of Asia.)

381
00:15:07.726 --> 00:15:09.762
Pay attention to his face now.

382
00:15:09.762 --> 00:15:11.330
- So Min told me... - But the thing is...

383
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.232
she was disgusted by his facial expression then.

384
00:15:13.966 --> 00:15:16.001
(They're excited to see Kwang Soo.)

385
00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:17.536
Look at that face.

386
00:15:17.536 --> 00:15:19.672
(He puts on a look as if he's the national guest.)

387
00:15:19.672 --> 00:15:21.207
But the thing is that...

388
00:15:21.207 --> 00:15:24.076
- he never does this with his hands. - That's my point.

389
00:15:24.076 --> 00:15:25.811
- He doesn't do that. - He rarely does this.

390
00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:27.346
- But aren't you envious? - But this...

391
00:15:27.746 --> 00:15:32.184
(They welcome the betrayer couple.)

392
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:34.119
- There were so many people. - Lee Kwang Soo!

393
00:15:34.386 --> 00:15:37.856
- Kwang Soo! - Look at you.

394
00:15:39.558 --> 00:15:40.960
Kwang Soo is so popular.

395
00:15:41.327 --> 00:15:43.929
It's not something that we can witness in Korea.

396
00:15:44.396 --> 00:15:46.031
Look at his unusual smile.

397
00:15:47.066 --> 00:15:50.169
(But at the thought of the penalty, he gets sad.)

398
00:15:50.169 --> 00:15:51.737
We really came.

399
00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:53.672
This is where we finally ended up.

400
00:15:54.506 --> 00:15:56.475
I had no idea that we'd be here.

401
00:15:56.475 --> 00:15:59.578
(The Tiger Moth Tour begins. What kinds of misfortunes are awaiting?)

402
00:15:59.578 --> 00:16:00.746
We're here.

403
00:16:00.746 --> 00:16:02.648
- We are finally here. - Your hotel is nice.

404
00:16:02.648 --> 00:16:04.516
- Gosh, that's a fancy hotel. - That's a five-star hotel.

405
00:16:04.917 --> 00:16:06.218
Tell us about our schedule.

406
00:16:06.852 --> 00:16:08.787
We were informed the seventh floor is the lobby.

407
00:16:08.787 --> 00:16:12.591
I'll share the schedule in the lobby.

408
00:16:12.658 --> 00:16:15.728
We prepared a meal since we figured you'd be hungry.

409
00:16:16.395 --> 00:16:18.197
And you can have a good night's sleep.

410
00:16:18.197 --> 00:16:20.566
You'll face the penalty tomorrow. That's the schedule.

411
00:16:20.699 --> 00:16:21.900
Then we can sleep tonight?

412
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.737
(Since tomorrow will be a long day, they're letting us rest.)

413
00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:27.506
(They arrive in the lobby at ease.)

414
00:16:27.506 --> 00:16:29.375
You jumped in Korea, remember?

415
00:16:29.675 --> 00:16:31.110
- Do we have to do it? - Let's jump again.

416
00:16:32.044 --> 00:16:33.779
- We arrived here. - You know how it works, right?

417
00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:35.881
- We'll jump, and we'll be here. - We arrived here from Korea.

418
00:16:36.248 --> 00:16:37.416
1, 2, 3.

419
00:16:37.416 --> 00:16:38.517
(Jumping)

420
00:16:39.151 --> 00:16:42.788
(What on earth are you doing?)

421
00:16:43.489 --> 00:16:47.760
(But they're doing their best acting the scene.)

422
00:16:49.428 --> 00:16:51.597
- Why didn't you edit that? - Why didn't you edit it?

423
00:16:51.597 --> 00:16:52.865
- You promised us. - Why didn't you edit that?

424
00:16:53.532 --> 00:16:55.434
- But no one does that nowadays. - Right.

425
00:16:55.668 --> 00:16:56.869
- That... - I used to do that.

426
00:16:56.869 --> 00:16:59.004
- Didn't "Wooroemae" use that? - Exactly.

427
00:16:59.004 --> 00:17:01.307
(Didn't "Wooroemae" use that?)

428
00:17:01.307 --> 00:17:02.574
So Min suggested doing it.

429
00:17:02.841 --> 00:17:03.909
1, 2, 3.

430
00:17:03.909 --> 00:17:06.912
(This technique was seen in "Wooroemae" in 1986.)

431
00:17:06.912 --> 00:17:10.215
(Where are you, villains?)

432
00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:13.085
(Grabbing him by his collar)

433
00:17:13.085 --> 00:17:14.386
What are you doing? What's going on?

434
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.722
(What is your problem?)

435
00:17:16.722 --> 00:17:19.091
- It's from this morning. - What's wrong with you?

436
00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:20.125
(From this morning?)

437
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.897
(She grabbed him by his collar in the morning,)

438
00:17:24.897 --> 00:17:28.367
(and it continues even in Indonesia.)

439
00:17:28.367 --> 00:17:30.769
- Combine it from the morning. - What's wrong with you?

440
00:17:31.937 --> 00:17:33.672
How can they combine the two clips?

441
00:17:33.939 --> 00:17:35.941
This is so weird. Are we in Indonesia?

442
00:17:36.575 --> 00:17:37.976
We are in Indonesia, right?

443
00:17:38.644 --> 00:17:40.779
- Yes, we are in Indonesia. - We're in Yogyakarta.

444
00:17:41.947 --> 00:17:44.249
Anyway, you have arrived in Indonesia.

445
00:17:44.249 --> 00:17:47.386
Since it's been a long day, give us your bags. We'll move them for you.

446
00:17:47.386 --> 00:17:48.654
Hand us your bags.

447
00:17:49.054 --> 00:17:51.090
We'll give you the cards for your rooms.

448
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.891
Kwang Soo, you have Room 549.

449
00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:55.928
- So Min, here's yours. - Thank you.

450
00:17:55.928 --> 00:17:57.529
It's Room 501.

451
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:59.298
Can't I put the bag in my room?

452
00:17:59.832 --> 00:18:01.100
- No, let us. - I can do it.

453
00:18:01.767 --> 00:18:03.669
- Something's going on. - I can do it.

454
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:06.438
- They gave us the card, but why... - You can't give them that easily.

455
00:18:06.972 --> 00:18:08.540
You willingly gave them your luggage.

456
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.509
You have received the cards for your rooms.

457
00:18:10.809 --> 00:18:13.278
Take a brief recess, and we'll resume later.

458
00:18:13.479 --> 00:18:14.747
We can go up now?

459
00:18:14.747 --> 00:18:16.048
- Yes. - I can take a shower now?

460
00:18:16.281 --> 00:18:17.916
Yes, you can. Do whatever you want.

461
00:18:17.916 --> 00:18:19.051
(But what about our bags?)

462
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:20.185
Can we take my luggage?

463
00:18:20.386 --> 00:18:22.221
I need my luggage to wash.

464
00:18:22.788 --> 00:18:24.456
Why did they take the luggage?

465
00:18:24.456 --> 00:18:25.824
(But the luggage the crew took hasn't moved.)

466
00:18:25.824 --> 00:18:27.459
Your luggage...

467
00:18:27.926 --> 00:18:29.862
has been confiscated by the crew.

468
00:18:32.264 --> 00:18:34.266
(It's confiscated by the crew?)

469
00:18:34.266 --> 00:18:36.468
(Confiscated!)

470
00:18:37.136 --> 00:18:38.237
(No way.)

471
00:18:38.237 --> 00:18:39.304
What are you doing?

472
00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:42.674
- I saw that coming. - This is so awkward.

473
00:18:42.674 --> 00:18:44.376
Seriously. Why did you give it to them?

474
00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:45.577
- You fell for it so easily. - What are you doing?

475
00:18:45.577 --> 00:18:48.781
- The producer isn't normal. - It's confiscated?

476
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:50.816
There's a reason that we took away your luggage.

477
00:18:50.816 --> 00:18:51.884
It's right in front of us.

478
00:18:51.884 --> 00:18:54.086
I can just take this, can't I?

479
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.454
How could you...

480
00:18:57.756 --> 00:19:03.595
There are only two ways of retrieving your luggage.

481
00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:05.998
You will have to either accomplish your given mission.

482
00:19:06.131 --> 00:19:08.167
Or for 30 dollars, you may take...

483
00:19:08.167 --> 00:19:10.436
- 30 dollars? - 1 item.

484
00:19:10.436 --> 00:19:11.670
(They must pay 30 dollars per item.)

485
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.938
(Unbelievable)

486
00:19:12.938 --> 00:19:14.339
I only have 50 dollars.

487
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.075
- Isn't it three dollars? - This is stealing.

488
00:19:17.276 --> 00:19:19.211
They're thieves.

489
00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:21.447
Do we pay if we fail the mission?

490
00:19:21.547 --> 00:19:24.116
- If you clear the mission... - Can we take it?

491
00:19:24.116 --> 00:19:26.518
If you clear it, you may take the luggage for free.

492
00:19:26.585 --> 00:19:28.720
I keep asking, but did I do something wrong?

493
00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:31.857
- All my things... - Our trip here was too easy.

494
00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:33.392
I thought it was strange.

495
00:19:33.392 --> 00:19:35.994
Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour...

496
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:37.696
has started.

497
00:19:37.996 --> 00:19:40.666
Here's your first mission.

498
00:19:40.866 --> 00:19:46.872
Let's start Catch the Bag If You Can.

499
00:19:46.872 --> 00:19:48.407
- There's a title. - Does someone...

500
00:19:48.407 --> 00:19:49.508
come up with the title?

501
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:51.109
We do a lot of research.

502
00:19:51.109 --> 00:19:52.311
(We work hard constantly.)

503
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:53.979
Catch the Bag If You Can.

504
00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:58.517
There's a traditional Indonesian game called Spoon and Marble Race.

505
00:19:58.517 --> 00:20:00.886
- Spoon and Marble Race? - You must pass the goal while...

506
00:20:00.886 --> 00:20:03.088
holding a spoon with a marble with your mouth.

507
00:20:04.089 --> 00:20:06.391
Didn't we play that often?

508
00:20:06.391 --> 00:20:07.459
- Right. - Right?

509
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.796
We're in a hotel, so we can't run.

510
00:20:10.996 --> 00:20:13.866
Hold the spoon in your mouth. Without dropping the marble,

511
00:20:13.866 --> 00:20:15.367
transfer it to the person next to you.

512
00:20:15.367 --> 00:20:18.871
You succeed if you place the marble in the cup.

513
00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:20.806
- This is easy. - Are we on the same team?

514
00:20:20.806 --> 00:20:22.574
Yes. You have 60 seconds.

515
00:20:22.808 --> 00:20:25.711
You succeed if you place over 10 marbles in the goal.

516
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:27.880
- This is possible. - I agree.

517
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.916
They're given a mission as soon as they arrive.

518
00:20:30.916 --> 00:20:32.184
I bet it was annoying.

519
00:20:32.184 --> 00:20:33.886
I couldn't believe it.

520
00:20:35.487 --> 00:20:39.791
(Let's make 10 marbles in the goal.)

521
00:20:40.058 --> 00:20:43.729
10 marbles in 60 seconds means you succeed.

522
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:46.231
You may take your luggage without paying.

523
00:20:46.231 --> 00:20:48.800
If you fail, you must pay.

524
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.335
- Okay. - Get ready.

525
00:20:50.636 --> 00:20:51.937
Let's do it.

526
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.705
Start.

527
00:20:53.705 --> 00:20:55.340
(Spoon and Marble Race starts.)

528
00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.975
(Being careful)

529
00:20:59.511 --> 00:21:01.647
It's similar to the marble game during childhood.

530
00:21:01.647 --> 00:21:03.682
- It doesn't seem hard. - It wasn't.

531
00:21:03.682 --> 00:21:06.552
- They should move faster. - We play games often.

532
00:21:06.752 --> 00:21:08.754
Kwang Soo is getting faster.

533
00:21:09.288 --> 00:21:11.957
So Min should lower herself to make it faster.

534
00:21:11.957 --> 00:21:13.559
They should have switched places.

535
00:21:13.926 --> 00:21:16.395
Transferring the marble is easier.

536
00:21:16.395 --> 00:21:17.896
So Min wanted to do it.

537
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.765
- I see. - Marbles are heavy.

538
00:21:19.765 --> 00:21:21.500
They might knock over the cup.

539
00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:23.969
- It isn't difficult. - 30 seconds passed.

540
00:21:23.969 --> 00:21:24.970
You have 10 seconds.

541
00:21:26.905 --> 00:21:29.174
- He's good at receiving it. - Right.

542
00:21:29.942 --> 00:21:31.076
How many are there?

543
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.745
- 3, 2, 1. - We did it.

544
00:21:33.745 --> 00:21:34.746
(How many marbles are in the cup?)

545
00:21:34.746 --> 00:21:36.048
Time is up.

546
00:21:36.748 --> 00:21:38.016
Let's count the marbles.

547
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.351
My teeth hurt.

548
00:21:39.351 --> 00:21:40.352
(It's time to count.)

549
00:21:40.352 --> 00:21:43.755
1, 2, 3, 4,

550
00:21:43.755 --> 00:21:47.659
5, 6, 7, 8.

551
00:21:47.926 --> 00:21:50.429
(Currently, there are 8 marbles.)

552
00:21:50.429 --> 00:21:51.797
(Did they place 10 marbles?)

553
00:21:51.797 --> 00:21:53.532
- Is it less than 10? - They have 8.

554
00:21:53.532 --> 00:21:55.701
We cleared the mission in one go.

555
00:21:57.035 --> 00:21:58.837
- 8, 9, 10. - We have 10.

556
00:21:58.837 --> 00:22:00.706
(They succeed.)

557
00:22:00.706 --> 00:22:02.107
We have 10.

558
00:22:02.674 --> 00:22:03.976
- We made it. - Didn't we?

559
00:22:04.977 --> 00:22:06.945
- We work well as a team. - That was fast.

560
00:22:06.945 --> 00:22:08.647
It was hard to succeed.

561
00:22:08.647 --> 00:22:09.648
(They feel overwhelmed.)

562
00:22:09.648 --> 00:22:11.617
- We worked well together then. - Right.

563
00:22:11.617 --> 00:22:13.418
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo could put 11.

564
00:22:13.418 --> 00:22:15.787
Of course. We would make it easily.

565
00:22:16.088 --> 00:22:18.156
- Did you think you said the answer? - Yes.

566
00:22:18.457 --> 00:22:20.192
(She was nervous.)

567
00:22:20.192 --> 00:22:22.394
- I shouldn't say anything. - You shouldn't.

568
00:22:23.795 --> 00:22:25.964
- We made it. - It was almost impossible.

569
00:22:25.964 --> 00:22:26.965
(They can take the luggage for free.)

570
00:22:26.965 --> 00:22:28.667
- You cleared the mission. - Okay.

571
00:22:29.735 --> 00:22:32.437
- Our teamwork makes it possible. - You'll get your luggage.

572
00:22:32.437 --> 00:22:34.306
Between the two of you,

573
00:22:34.306 --> 00:22:36.274
choose which luggage you'll open.

574
00:22:39.277 --> 00:22:40.946
- Must we choose one? - I have everything in it.

575
00:22:40.946 --> 00:22:43.148
- Can't we open both? - Do we open only one?

576
00:22:43.315 --> 00:22:45.217
You can open only one of them.

577
00:22:45.217 --> 00:22:46.918
You didn't tell us before.

578
00:22:47.319 --> 00:22:48.820
You're so mean.

579
00:22:50.956 --> 00:22:53.925
You must take items in the luggage.

580
00:22:53.925 --> 00:22:56.461
I want to slap Chul Min on the neck.

581
00:22:56.828 --> 00:22:59.197
- I'm serious. - What do you have in your bag?

582
00:22:59.564 --> 00:23:01.166
- What do you have? - I have everything.

583
00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:02.668
- Me too. - I have two luggage.

584
00:23:03.735 --> 00:23:07.005
I have everything in my luggage. Let's open mine.

585
00:23:09.441 --> 00:23:11.176
I will let you if you pay me 2.5 dollars.

586
00:23:12.077 --> 00:23:13.278
How about 2.3 dollars?

587
00:23:14.846 --> 00:23:16.348
- Pay two dollars. - I don't have much money.

588
00:23:16.782 --> 00:23:19.584
Let's open mine. I'll pay you two dollars.

589
00:23:20.052 --> 00:23:21.586
- I can't give more than two. - Okay.

590
00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:23.188
- Two dollars? - Okay.

591
00:23:23.188 --> 00:23:24.256
(They agree to open Kwang Soo's.)

592
00:23:24.256 --> 00:23:26.825
Kwang Soo pays two dollars to open his luggage.

593
00:23:26.825 --> 00:23:28.126
- Okay. - Goodness.

594
00:23:28.126 --> 00:23:29.728
- I gave her two dollars. - Let's open his.

595
00:23:29.728 --> 00:23:30.796
(Current mission money status)

596
00:23:30.796 --> 00:23:33.131
- So Min has 56 dollars. - Kwang Soo has a lot.

597
00:23:34.566 --> 00:23:35.767
(He finally opens his luggage.)

598
00:23:35.767 --> 00:23:37.035
Here are the toiletries.

599
00:23:37.869 --> 00:23:39.204
You have nothing in it.

600
00:23:39.204 --> 00:23:40.839
You can only open it once.

601
00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:42.874
- I'll take my toiletries. - You can only open it once.

602
00:23:42.874 --> 00:23:45.811
Show us what you have inside the luggage.

603
00:23:45.811 --> 00:23:46.912
I have this.

604
00:23:46.912 --> 00:23:48.380
(Is that a game player?)

605
00:23:49.915 --> 00:23:52.384
Why did you bring it all the way here?

606
00:23:52.951 --> 00:23:54.286
We have a lot of free time.

607
00:23:54.286 --> 00:23:56.922
- Why did you pack that? - Why did you take a game player?

608
00:23:56.922 --> 00:23:58.857
He has the wrong attitude.

609
00:23:58.857 --> 00:24:00.826
- He has no common sense. - I agree.

610
00:24:01.727 --> 00:24:04.029
(Goodness)

611
00:24:04.396 --> 00:24:07.399
You shouldn't waste electricity at the hotel.

612
00:24:07.399 --> 00:24:08.567
Electricity?

613
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.435
What's wrong with using it?

614
00:24:10.435 --> 00:24:13.438
- Put back the item that you chose. - Okay.

615
00:24:13.438 --> 00:24:15.407
(He puts it back in the luggage.)

616
00:24:15.407 --> 00:24:17.109
What's this?

617
00:24:17.109 --> 00:24:18.944
- It glows in the dark. - Why did you bring it?

618
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:21.480
- Why did you pack that? - What for?

619
00:24:21.947 --> 00:24:24.116
- Why did you take the frog? - What is it for?

620
00:24:24.316 --> 00:24:25.617
It's for sleeping.

621
00:24:25.617 --> 00:24:27.285
(Frog that glows in the dark makes him sleep better.)

622
00:24:27.285 --> 00:24:28.954
I get scared to sleep in unfamiliar places.

623
00:24:28.954 --> 00:24:31.556
You may take only one item...

624
00:24:31.556 --> 00:24:33.959
from your luggage.

625
00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:35.660
I must take toiletries.

626
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.929
To take an item from the luggage,

627
00:24:38.096 --> 00:24:41.466
throw an Indonesian coin into the luggage.

628
00:24:44.336 --> 00:24:46.938
(He may take the item that he hits with a coin.)

629
00:24:46.938 --> 00:24:49.374
You may take the first item that you hit with the coin.

630
00:24:49.374 --> 00:24:51.176
You should tell us before.

631
00:24:51.176 --> 00:24:52.778
- Why didn't you? - Is there another mission?

632
00:24:52.778 --> 00:24:55.046
- That's so unfair. - Come on.

633
00:24:55.347 --> 00:24:56.882
That's horrible.

634
00:24:56.882 --> 00:24:58.917
- Let's be fair. - Goodness.

635
00:24:58.917 --> 00:25:01.787
There are too many missions.

636
00:25:01.787 --> 00:25:03.188
- Does that make sense? - That's too much.

637
00:25:03.188 --> 00:25:04.956
We already cleared the mission.

638
00:25:04.956 --> 00:25:06.258
How could you, Chul Min?

639
00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:09.094
Am I going to New Zealand?

640
00:25:09.094 --> 00:25:10.695
(He only thinks of himself.)

641
00:25:10.695 --> 00:25:12.464
Watch the video. Forget about New Zealand.

642
00:25:12.464 --> 00:25:14.366
I can't concentrate.

643
00:25:15.567 --> 00:25:16.868
What about the two dollars that I paid?

644
00:25:17.536 --> 00:25:20.071
- Throw the coin behind the line. - I remember these boxers.

645
00:25:22.107 --> 00:25:23.675
(Which boxers?)

646
00:25:23.675 --> 00:25:25.377
- I remember them. - What are you doing?

647
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.580
- What are you doing? - Remember the ones you showed?

648
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.816
- I wore each of them. - Remember?

649
00:25:32.384 --> 00:25:34.319
(It was during a family special.)

650
00:25:34.319 --> 00:25:36.054
I remember the rainbow boxers.

651
00:25:36.054 --> 00:25:37.455
- Is it that one? - Yes.

652
00:25:37.455 --> 00:25:39.524
- Do you still have them? - Didn't they rot?

653
00:25:39.524 --> 00:25:42.494
Kwang Soo likes those colors.

654
00:25:42.494 --> 00:25:44.329
- Didn't they stretch? - No, they didn't.

655
00:25:44.329 --> 00:25:45.831
They shrank when I washed them.

656
00:25:47.265 --> 00:25:48.867
This is an Indonesian coin.

657
00:25:48.867 --> 00:25:51.837
Excuse me, Mr. Producer.

658
00:25:51.837 --> 00:25:52.838
(She calls the producer.)

659
00:25:52.838 --> 00:25:55.106
Can you tell us if there's another mission?

660
00:25:55.106 --> 00:25:57.175
- Is it the last mission? - It should be.

661
00:25:57.175 --> 00:25:59.110
- It's the last. - There can't be more.

662
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.645
Who throws the coin?

663
00:26:00.645 --> 00:26:02.681
- One of you can do it. - It's me.

664
00:26:02.681 --> 00:26:03.715
(Trust me.)

665
00:26:03.715 --> 00:26:05.317
- Can you do it? - Of course.

666
00:26:06.518 --> 00:26:07.919
I don't think you can.

667
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.188
There's something that we brought.

668
00:26:10.188 --> 00:26:12.257
It's called slime monster.

669
00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.259
- Try to throw it. - It's hard to throw.

670
00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:16.761
(He throws the slime monster to test it.)

671
00:26:16.761 --> 00:26:19.331
- Gosh. - It's okay.

672
00:26:19.331 --> 00:26:20.665
- What do you mean? - I'll try again.

673
00:26:20.665 --> 00:26:22.067
It's not okay.

674
00:26:22.067 --> 00:26:26.004
(The grip isn't so bad.)

675
00:26:26.104 --> 00:26:29.474
- It's good enough. - It won't work.

676
00:26:29.474 --> 00:26:30.675
- I don't think so. - It doesn't matter.

677
00:26:30.675 --> 00:26:32.978
Throw the coin instead. Kwang Soo.

678
00:26:33.278 --> 00:26:36.081
(What's going on?)

679
00:26:36.414 --> 00:26:37.949
(The slime monster is everywhere.)

680
00:26:37.949 --> 00:26:39.651
- Gosh. - What happened?

681
00:26:40.685 --> 00:26:42.954
It's all over my clothes.

682
00:26:43.588 --> 00:26:44.656
What is it?

683
00:26:46.024 --> 00:26:48.326
- It's slime. - What?

684
00:26:49.494 --> 00:26:50.929
Please say, "challenge".

685
00:26:50.929 --> 00:26:52.364
(He decides to throw the coin.)

686
00:26:54.199 --> 00:26:56.401
- It's because of the slime monster. - Can he take the whole luggage?

687
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:58.670
(It's not as easy as he thought.)

688
00:26:59.871 --> 00:27:01.239
- Goodness. - Wait.

689
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.975
Can you pull it toward the right?

690
00:27:04.109 --> 00:27:06.011
(Hello.)

691
00:27:06.011 --> 00:27:07.846
It's still here.

692
00:27:07.846 --> 00:27:08.847
(He finds more slime monster.)

693
00:27:08.847 --> 00:27:11.016
It's everywhere. What's going on?

694
00:27:11.016 --> 00:27:13.051
- It's like cell division. - What is it?

695
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:15.120
Did it reproduce?

696
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.521
What's going on?

697
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:17.956
I keep finding more.

698
00:27:18.456 --> 00:27:19.791
It's slime monster.

699
00:27:19.791 --> 00:27:20.926
(It's an invasion of a green monster.)

700
00:27:20.926 --> 00:27:22.594
My clothes turned green.

701
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.898
Challenge.

702
00:27:26.898 --> 00:27:28.366
(He plays the game.)

703
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:33.004
(Question for Round 1 of Truth Game)

704
00:27:33.004 --> 00:27:35.340
- Please. - Is this the question?

705
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.741
I remember it.

706
00:27:36.741 --> 00:27:40.178
(He throws the coin to determine which item to take.)

707
00:27:40.845 --> 00:27:43.815
- The coin could fall in between. - Which item did it hit?

708
00:27:44.215 --> 00:27:45.717
It's the first item that the coin hits.

709
00:27:45.717 --> 00:27:47.285
(Here's the first question.)

710
00:27:47.285 --> 00:27:48.586
Which does the coin hit?

711
00:27:48.586 --> 00:27:49.988
It's where the coin lands.

712
00:27:49.988 --> 00:27:51.589
(Which item did Kwang Soo get?)

713
00:27:51.589 --> 00:27:56.962
- Is it the first item that it hits? - What is it?

714
00:27:56.962 --> 00:27:58.396
This is the question.

715
00:27:58.396 --> 00:28:00.765
- Do you remember it? - I remember it clearly.

716
00:28:00.765 --> 00:28:02.600
What was in his luggage?

717
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.869
- Boxers and toiletries. - A game player and a bag.

718
00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:07.205
- Medicine. - Glow-in-the-dark frog.

719
00:28:07.205 --> 00:28:10.508
It's not easy for the coin to land on the frog.

720
00:28:10.575 --> 00:28:13.311
Kwang Soo and So Min.

721
00:28:13.845 --> 00:28:16.848
Choose an envelope, and decide whether it's true or not.

722
00:28:16.848 --> 00:28:18.650
- Really? - True or false?

723
00:28:18.817 --> 00:28:20.819
Is it only one of them who tells the truth?

724
00:28:20.819 --> 00:28:22.821
- That's right. - Is that so?

725
00:28:22.821 --> 00:28:26.191
(Which will Kwang Soo and So Min choose?)

726
00:28:26.458 --> 00:28:29.527
Please come to the front 1 by 1.

727
00:28:29.728 --> 00:28:32.130
- Make your statement. - Is it a statement?

728
00:28:32.664 --> 00:28:35.000
- I state that... - We must listen carefully...

729
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.201
when Kwang Soo makes an argument.

730
00:28:36.201 --> 00:28:38.236
I say that it's true.

731
00:28:38.236 --> 00:28:39.304
He looks relaxed.

732
00:28:39.304 --> 00:28:40.705
- Also, - His face looks relaxed.

733
00:28:40.705 --> 00:28:43.541
the coin landed on my underwear. I remember it clearly.

734
00:28:43.541 --> 00:28:44.876
I remember it clearly.

735
00:28:44.876 --> 00:28:47.345
(He says the coin landed on his underwear.)

736
00:28:47.645 --> 00:28:50.215
Round 1 is easy.

737
00:28:50.215 --> 00:28:51.716
You know it by looking at my face.

738
00:28:51.716 --> 00:28:52.751
- Right. - Yes.

739
00:28:52.751 --> 00:28:54.386
Will you only say the truth?

740
00:28:54.386 --> 00:28:55.787
Yes. I'll only say the truth.

741
00:28:55.787 --> 00:28:58.690
During Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour,

742
00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.526
- did you sneak into So Min's room? - Sorry?

743
00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.094
No, I didn't.

744
00:29:03.094 --> 00:29:05.597
- What's with the glow-in-the-dark? - Sorry?

745
00:29:05.597 --> 00:29:07.298
- The frog. - Did someone give it to you?

746
00:29:07.298 --> 00:29:09.067
- Everyone's curious. - I bought it.

747
00:29:09.734 --> 00:29:11.936
I don't like to sleep in the dark.

748
00:29:11.936 --> 00:29:14.305
Did you buy two and give one to someone else?

749
00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:16.207
This game doesn't work that way.

750
00:29:16.207 --> 00:29:17.208
(Speechless)

751
00:29:17.208 --> 00:29:18.710
When was your last kiss?

752
00:29:19.544 --> 00:29:20.578
- Excuse me. - What's with you?

753
00:29:20.578 --> 00:29:21.946
Do you have a girlfriend?

754
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.381
Shut it.

755
00:29:24.349 --> 00:29:26.351
- I don't. What's with you? - You don't?

756
00:29:26.351 --> 00:29:27.886
Tell us the truth.

757
00:29:27.886 --> 00:29:28.887
I'm telling you the truth.

758
00:29:28.887 --> 00:29:29.988
He's getting angry.

759
00:29:29.988 --> 00:29:32.390
We have to find the truth.

760
00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.426
It's a truth game.

761
00:29:34.426 --> 00:29:36.494
It's not the kind you play when you drink.

762
00:29:36.528 --> 00:29:38.029
Why are you so worked up?

763
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:39.631
- I mean... - You look angry.

764
00:29:39.898 --> 00:29:43.268
When you lie, you tend to say a lot.

765
00:29:43.268 --> 00:29:45.136
Your explanation gets long. But let me tell you.

766
00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.805
- Where did the coin end up? - Look at the bag.

767
00:29:46.838 --> 00:29:49.007
Which item is taking...

768
00:29:49.007 --> 00:29:51.309
the most space?

769
00:29:51.309 --> 00:29:52.544
- The game console? - Exactly.

770
00:29:52.744 --> 00:29:55.246
It has a solid surface and takes up a lot of space.

771
00:29:55.747 --> 00:29:57.615
Also, I think it was intentional.

772
00:29:57.715 --> 00:29:59.284
He probably wanted to play games so badly.

773
00:29:59.284 --> 00:30:03.521
(So Min says the coin ended up on the game console.)

774
00:30:03.755 --> 00:30:06.024
Let me ask you one more question.

775
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:09.227
(Jae Seok wants to ask another question.)

776
00:30:09.227 --> 00:30:12.664
What material was your toiletry bag?

777
00:30:12.897 --> 00:30:15.266
What's with you?

778
00:30:15.266 --> 00:30:16.267
(Stop pretending to be sharp.)

779
00:30:16.267 --> 00:30:18.736
Stop playing detective.

780
00:30:18.736 --> 00:30:20.638
- What was the material? - What's with the way you speak?

781
00:30:20.805 --> 00:30:22.674
- Was it cloth? - Let me stand up.

782
00:30:22.674 --> 00:30:23.875
- What was the material? - What?

783
00:30:24.676 --> 00:30:26.377
- Am I a criminal? - What was it?

784
00:30:26.377 --> 00:30:27.378
Cut it out.

785
00:30:28.346 --> 00:30:30.515
It's not easy for the coin to end up right in the middle.

786
00:30:30.515 --> 00:30:33.218
Did it go in directly or bounce in?

787
00:30:33.218 --> 00:30:34.819
To be honest, I don't remember.

788
00:30:34.819 --> 00:30:35.887
- You don't remember? - I don't.

789
00:30:35.887 --> 00:30:38.957
Kwang Soo is telling the truth.

790
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:40.158
Let me explain.

791
00:30:40.158 --> 00:30:41.926
Stop trying to manipulate us.

792
00:30:41.926 --> 00:30:43.261
You're like Solomon.

793
00:30:43.261 --> 00:30:44.729
Kwang Soo is telling the truth.

794
00:30:44.929 --> 00:30:46.331
- Gosh. - You're telling the truth.

795
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:47.565
My goodness.

796
00:30:47.565 --> 00:30:49.267
We don't have to hear anymore.

797
00:30:49.267 --> 00:30:51.236
Are you being honest?

798
00:30:51.236 --> 00:30:54.005
Of course. Kwang Soo packed the game console himself.

799
00:30:54.005 --> 00:30:55.907
- It means he wanted to use it. - Then...

800
00:30:55.907 --> 00:30:56.908
did he play games that night?

801
00:30:57.675 --> 00:30:58.676
He said he did.

802
00:31:00.278 --> 00:31:01.346
- He said he did. - What?

803
00:31:01.346 --> 00:31:03.314
If he got the game console, he must have played games.

804
00:31:03.314 --> 00:31:04.415
What is she saying?

805
00:31:04.415 --> 00:31:05.517
- I mean... - He played alone?

806
00:31:05.517 --> 00:31:07.185
- I didn't play games. - How can you not know?

807
00:31:07.185 --> 00:31:09.287
She's either lying or talking gibberish.

808
00:31:09.287 --> 00:31:13.525
I'd guess Kwang Soo is telling the truth,

809
00:31:13.658 --> 00:31:16.928
- but I hate to see that face. - What do you mean?

810
00:31:16.928 --> 00:31:18.897
(Jae Seok hates that Kwang Soo looks so confident.)

811
00:31:18.897 --> 00:31:20.999
- It's disgusting. - It's disgusting.

812
00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:22.934
- He looks so confident. - Right?

813
00:31:22.934 --> 00:31:24.936
His face is disgusting.

814
00:31:24.936 --> 00:31:27.205
- No, listen. - Your face is disgusting.

815
00:31:27.205 --> 00:31:28.206
Gosh.

816
00:31:28.406 --> 00:31:30.708
- I'm telling the truth. - If you want to shoot on the 8th,

817
00:31:31.176 --> 00:31:32.844
- do whatever you want. - Oh, right.

818
00:31:32.844 --> 00:31:35.246
- I won't say anymore. - I forgot about that.

819
00:31:35.246 --> 00:31:37.448
- Let's have a good start. - That depends on this.

820
00:31:37.448 --> 00:31:40.251
It'll decide whether we'll shoot on the 8th.

821
00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:44.155
(Who is telling the truth, Kwang Soo or So Min?)

822
00:31:44.155 --> 00:31:46.558
- One... - Hold on.

823
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:48.226
- Gosh. - My goodness.

824
00:31:48.226 --> 00:31:49.894
This is huge.

825
00:31:49.894 --> 00:31:52.030
If you get it wrong, you won't get any food.

826
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.264
One.

827
00:31:53.264 --> 00:31:54.365
(If they get it wrong, they'll get a penalty badge.)

828
00:31:54.365 --> 00:31:55.366
- 2. - 2.

829
00:31:55.366 --> 00:31:56.634
It'd be absurd if I lose.

830
00:31:56.634 --> 00:31:57.835
Three.

831
00:31:57.835 --> 00:31:59.237
(Whichever attracts more supporters will get to eat.)

832
00:31:59.237 --> 00:32:00.939
(Whom will the members choose?)

833
00:32:00.939 --> 00:32:02.006
- All right. - I choose So Min.

834
00:32:03.007 --> 00:32:05.577
(Jae Suk and Ji Hyo choose So Min.)

835
00:32:06.211 --> 00:32:07.946
(Kwang Soo attracted more supporters.)

836
00:32:07.946 --> 00:32:10.048
Gosh! This is frustrating.

837
00:32:10.048 --> 00:32:12.350
Why would you choose So Min?

838
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.486
Kwang Soo was so calm.

839
00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.790
So Min looked so frustrated.

840
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.326
Which item did Kwang Soo get?

841
00:32:21.326 --> 00:32:22.560
Please put on your earphones.

842
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.661
Let's see it.

843
00:32:23.661 --> 00:32:26.264
- Let's see it. - If Kwang Soo lied,

844
00:32:26.264 --> 00:32:28.166
it means he's a real actor.

845
00:32:28.166 --> 00:32:30.134
So Min looked so frustrated.

846
00:32:30.134 --> 00:32:31.436
You're a real actor.

847
00:32:31.436 --> 00:32:33.238
So Min looked so...

848
00:32:33.238 --> 00:32:36.741
Let's watch the video.

849
00:32:36.741 --> 00:32:38.810
- Gosh. - Kwang Soo looked so natural.

850
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.445
So Min is still innocent.

851
00:32:41.145 --> 00:32:42.747
Please. I'm worried.

852
00:32:43.014 --> 00:32:47.418
(They can get only one item. Where did the coin end up?)

853
00:32:49.387 --> 00:32:50.355
(The game console is right in the middle.)

854
00:32:50.355 --> 00:32:52.490
- The game console was there? - It was there?

855
00:32:52.657 --> 00:32:55.126
Then the coin might have ended up there.

856
00:32:55.426 --> 00:32:57.695
- The game console was there? - Just watch.

857
00:32:59.897 --> 00:33:04.035
(Did the coin end up on the underwear bag?)

858
00:33:05.737 --> 00:33:07.238
(Game console)

859
00:33:07.238 --> 00:33:09.407
You're getting the game console.

860
00:33:09.841 --> 00:33:10.875
Hey.

861
00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:13.411
(I can't believe this.)

862
00:33:13.544 --> 00:33:15.146
He got the game console.

863
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.748
- The game console? - I got it right.

864
00:33:16.748 --> 00:33:17.749
Did I win?

865
00:33:17.749 --> 00:33:21.019
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo get it right.)

866
00:33:21.019 --> 00:33:22.287
- We got it right. - So Min.

867
00:33:22.287 --> 00:33:24.055
- So Min. - We got it right.

868
00:33:24.055 --> 00:33:31.195
(The ones who were fooled by Kwang Soo will get no food.)

869
00:33:32.597 --> 00:33:35.466
(The only item they will have is the game console.)

870
00:33:35.466 --> 00:33:36.434
Kwang Soo.

871
00:33:36.434 --> 00:33:37.435
(The only item they will have is the game console.)

872
00:33:38.236 --> 00:33:40.104
Can you wash your body with the game console?

873
00:33:40.838 --> 00:33:43.207
Why did you bring that?

874
00:33:43.207 --> 00:33:44.876
You won't play games here.

875
00:33:45.677 --> 00:33:47.545
I thought we wouldn't have a lot to do.

876
00:33:47.545 --> 00:33:48.546
(I wanted to play games during our free time.)

877
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:52.650
Hold on.

878
00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.886
- I was telling the truth. - Hold on.

879
00:33:55.019 --> 00:33:56.954
Thank you for believing me.

880
00:33:57.455 --> 00:33:58.756
Thank you.

881
00:33:58.756 --> 00:34:01.726
It's Jong Kook's fault.

882
00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.896
You led us on.

883
00:34:05.096 --> 00:34:07.398
Jong Kook said it too loudly...

884
00:34:07.398 --> 00:34:09.367
in the beginning.

885
00:34:09.367 --> 00:34:11.336
- Right? - It's Jong Kook's fault.

886
00:34:11.336 --> 00:34:13.004
Jong Kook got so many in trouble.

887
00:34:13.004 --> 00:34:14.238
Stop doing that.

888
00:34:14.238 --> 00:34:15.940
- I... - It's all his fault.

889
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.308
overlooked one thing.

890
00:34:17.775 --> 00:34:19.944
I thought I was very close with Kwang Soo, but I wasn't.

891
00:34:19.944 --> 00:34:21.245
(I wasn't so close with Kwang Soo.)

892
00:34:21.846 --> 00:34:23.681
- You were being fooled. - I didn't know that.

893
00:34:23.681 --> 00:34:25.016
- You were fooled. - I didn't know.

894
00:34:25.016 --> 00:34:26.451
I thought I was close with him.

895
00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:28.920
Kwang Soo was fooling you with that sly look.

896
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.356
Haha, why do you never trust me?

897
00:34:31.556 --> 00:34:33.424
- I trusted you. - Why do you never trust me?

898
00:34:33.424 --> 00:34:35.526
- I trusted you. - Does it make me a bad person...

899
00:34:35.526 --> 00:34:37.028
and So Min a good person?

900
00:34:37.028 --> 00:34:38.730
What is going on?

901
00:34:39.197 --> 00:34:40.898
Everyone's apologizing to So Min.

902
00:34:40.898 --> 00:34:42.767
You've lost your innocence.

903
00:34:42.767 --> 00:34:44.235
- What? - You've lost your innocence.

904
00:34:44.335 --> 00:34:46.537
Before, it showed when he was lying.

905
00:34:46.904 --> 00:34:48.106
(Tiger Moth Tour Badges)

906
00:34:48.106 --> 00:34:50.675
Order whatever you want.

907
00:34:50.675 --> 00:34:51.809
Let's go.

908
00:34:52.577 --> 00:34:54.345
- It's coming. - It's coming.

909
00:34:55.146 --> 00:34:57.415
This is the charm of rest areas.

910
00:34:57.749 --> 00:34:59.751
Who ordered pork cutlet? It looks so tasty.

911
00:34:59.917 --> 00:35:02.387
This rest area has their own dishes.

912
00:35:02.387 --> 00:35:03.488
It's stew.

913
00:35:03.521 --> 00:35:04.655
It looks tasty.

914
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:06.157
It tastes so good.

915
00:35:06.157 --> 00:35:07.825
(Let's enjoy our food.)

916
00:35:08.526 --> 00:35:10.495
Are we really not getting any food?

917
00:35:10.995 --> 00:35:12.029
Really?

918
00:35:13.097 --> 00:35:14.465
It looked like the food was already ready.

919
00:35:14.665 --> 00:35:15.666
The stew...

920
00:35:15.666 --> 00:35:17.034
(Only Kwang Soo and the smart ones can enjoy lunch.)

921
00:35:17.034 --> 00:35:18.169
It tastes amazing.

922
00:35:18.169 --> 00:35:20.238
(Only Kwang Soo and the smart ones can enjoy lunch.)

923
00:35:20.238 --> 00:35:22.206
Is there no lunch for us?

924
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.175
I'm sure there's another chance.

925
00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:25.676
Are we really having no food?

926
00:35:25.676 --> 00:35:26.677
(They were fooled, and they get no food.)

927
00:35:26.677 --> 00:35:27.678
Seriously?

928
00:35:27.678 --> 00:35:30.314
(Aren't you giving us any food?)

929
00:35:30.314 --> 00:35:32.350
I get no food at home or at work.

930
00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.186
(I'm so sad.)

931
00:35:35.286 --> 00:35:37.255
You get no food at home or at work?

932
00:35:37.755 --> 00:35:39.624
Where can I eat?

933
00:35:39.624 --> 00:35:40.658
You get no food at home?

934
00:35:41.025 --> 00:35:43.528
- Where can I eat? - Prepare your own food.

935
00:35:43.528 --> 00:35:45.496
- What? - Prepare your own food.

936
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.365
I thought you were on a diet.

937
00:35:47.365 --> 00:35:49.634
I look thinner, right? I've lost 2kg.

938
00:35:49.634 --> 00:35:50.635
(He's lost 2kg.)

939
00:35:50.635 --> 00:35:52.236
Why are you not giving us any food?

940
00:35:53.237 --> 00:35:57.275
(Everybody's laughing except for one person.)

941
00:35:57.275 --> 00:36:00.211
(Panicking)

942
00:36:00.211 --> 00:36:02.780
- What's wrong? - He thought about Nevis Swing.

943
00:36:03.414 --> 00:36:06.350
- I thought about Nevis Swing. - Stop it.

944
00:36:06.517 --> 00:36:09.120
I can't get this song out of my head.

945
00:36:09.187 --> 00:36:12.156
(Swing, swing, swing, my baby)

946
00:36:12.857 --> 00:36:14.926
(He's going to ride Nevis Swing with Se Chan.)

947
00:36:14.926 --> 00:36:15.927
It keeps on playing in my head.

948
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.465
I can't stand it anymore.

949
00:36:20.465 --> 00:36:22.467
(They're upset.)

950
00:36:22.934 --> 00:36:24.335
Ji Hyo, give me some.

951
00:36:24.335 --> 00:36:25.369
That seemed natural.

952
00:36:25.736 --> 00:36:26.737
That seemed very natural.

953
00:36:26.737 --> 00:36:29.207
(What are you doing?)

954
00:36:29.207 --> 00:36:30.374
It looked very natural.

955
00:36:31.275 --> 00:36:32.944
Gosh.

956
00:36:32.944 --> 00:36:36.747
(Seok Jin was stopped by Jae Seok.)

957
00:36:36.747 --> 00:36:39.217
What am I doing with a spoon in my hand at 50?

958
00:36:39.717 --> 00:36:40.918
- Gosh. - Seok Jin.

959
00:36:40.918 --> 00:36:43.521
I used to do that back in middle school.

960
00:36:43.521 --> 00:36:45.656
One of my friends is a managing director of a company.

961
00:36:45.656 --> 00:36:49.327
(He's upset.)

962
00:36:49.327 --> 00:36:51.028
He's a managing director.

963
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:54.265
Another one is a senior managing director.

964
00:36:54.365 --> 00:36:55.500
I have money too.

965
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.134
A friend of yours is retired even.

966
00:36:57.335 --> 00:36:59.737
Observe the rules.

967
00:36:59.737 --> 00:37:01.906
- What's with you? - Don't break the rules.

968
00:37:01.939 --> 00:37:03.040
At your age.

969
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.176
Think of your age.

970
00:37:05.376 --> 00:37:07.345
I can at least eat the salad, right?

971
00:37:07.345 --> 00:37:09.747
If you don't even let me eat the salad, I'll get mad.

972
00:37:09.747 --> 00:37:12.416
Do you have to eat it?

973
00:37:12.416 --> 00:37:13.618
(Jae Seok stops him.)

974
00:37:13.618 --> 00:37:15.586
Hey.

975
00:37:16.387 --> 00:37:17.788
You punk.

976
00:37:18.656 --> 00:37:21.025
I'm seriously getting angry.

977
00:37:21.025 --> 00:37:22.159
I mean it.

978
00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:23.294
(Seok Jin is not even allowed to eat the salad.)

979
00:37:23.294 --> 00:37:25.196
Let me at least eat the salad.

980
00:37:25.429 --> 00:37:27.665
- I got him. - Let me eat the salad.

981
00:37:28.666 --> 00:37:29.667
Give up.

982
00:37:29.667 --> 00:37:31.536
- I'm going to drink some water. - Give up.

983
00:37:32.537 --> 00:37:33.538
Gosh, it's so annoying.

984
00:37:33.538 --> 00:37:35.806
(All Seok Jin got was a sip of water.)

985
00:37:37.675 --> 00:37:39.877
Please take the same seats as before.

986
00:37:42.179 --> 00:37:43.447
(Good luck, Haha.)

987
00:37:44.048 --> 00:37:45.516
It's you, right?

988
00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.985
- Hey. - You're riding Nevis Swing with me.

989
00:37:47.985 --> 00:37:50.388
Aren't you scared? Why are you so lively?

990
00:37:50.388 --> 00:37:51.556
We're not there yet.

991
00:37:51.556 --> 00:37:52.657
Gosh.

992
00:37:52.657 --> 00:37:54.659
I'm so jealous of you two.

993
00:37:54.659 --> 00:37:56.227
(I love New Zealand.)

994
00:37:56.794 --> 00:37:57.995
- Really? - Yes.

995
00:37:57.995 --> 00:37:59.897
This is why you never get penalized.

996
00:37:59.897 --> 00:38:02.266
But you'll get penalized today.

997
00:38:02.266 --> 00:38:04.535
Kwang Soo would never take you with him.

998
00:38:04.535 --> 00:38:06.270
Why don't we do this?

999
00:38:06.337 --> 00:38:08.005
Se Chan and I will ride the swing,

1000
00:38:08.005 --> 00:38:09.840
and you can just hang on to the rope.

1001
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.475
(Just hang on to the rope.)

1002
00:38:12.276 --> 00:38:13.377
(That sounds fun.)

1003
00:38:13.377 --> 00:38:15.346
- He'll die. - Hey.

1004
00:38:15.646 --> 00:38:17.248
And...

1005
00:38:17.248 --> 00:38:19.350
put some oil on your hands beforehand.

1006
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:20.351
(It'll be exciting.)

1007
00:38:20.351 --> 00:38:21.919
I'm sorry.

1008
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.621
(Scared)

1009
00:38:24.155 --> 00:38:25.957
That was risky.

1010
00:38:25.957 --> 00:38:30.027
I haven't heard Seok Jin's scared voice in a long time.

1011
00:38:30.127 --> 00:38:31.395
- This time, - He wants me dead.

1012
00:38:31.395 --> 00:38:33.431
Jong Kook got seriously angry.

1013
00:38:33.431 --> 00:38:35.566
Seok Jin was looking Jong Kook in the eye,

1014
00:38:35.566 --> 00:38:36.534
but then...

1015
00:38:36.534 --> 00:38:38.035
(Seok Jin lowered his eyes.)

1016
00:38:38.035 --> 00:38:40.538
I can't help it. I'm older than him,

1017
00:38:40.838 --> 00:38:42.239
but I can't help it.

1018
00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:44.475
You'll pretend you're not scared even if you are, right?

1019
00:38:44.575 --> 00:38:46.444
I won't.

1020
00:38:46.644 --> 00:38:48.045
Even if he's scared,

1021
00:38:48.145 --> 00:38:49.947
he'll just say, "This is a bit scary."

1022
00:38:50.181 --> 00:38:51.616
- You're right. - It's not funny at all.

1023
00:38:51.616 --> 00:38:53.150
- Right? - You're right.

1024
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.986
- "This is kind of scary." - "This is a bit scary."

1025
00:38:54.986 --> 00:38:56.754
- "This is scary." - And then, he'll jump.

1026
00:38:57.388 --> 00:38:58.556
- And then, he'll jump. - "This is not easy."

1027
00:38:58.556 --> 00:39:00.224
It's because he's Kim Jong Kook.

1028
00:39:00.625 --> 00:39:01.726
- Right? - Right.

1029
00:39:01.726 --> 00:39:03.427
- He has to do it. - It's hard.

1030
00:39:03.928 --> 00:39:05.596
And I'm Haha.

1031
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.264
Hey, you.

1032
00:39:07.264 --> 00:39:09.834
- This isn't a special about that. - It's driving me crazy.

1033
00:39:09.834 --> 00:39:11.335
- Keep your mouth shut. - Hey!

1034
00:39:11.335 --> 00:39:12.637
You should've told me at the end.

1035
00:39:12.837 --> 00:39:14.839
- I can't focus. - Right now...

1036
00:39:15.206 --> 00:39:16.741
I'm about to lose it.

1037
00:39:17.074 --> 00:39:18.175
All right.

1038
00:39:18.175 --> 00:39:20.111
I'll play the clip for the second round of Tiger Moth Tour...

1039
00:39:20.111 --> 00:39:22.847
Truth Game that the loser of the game will broadcast live on Chuseok.

1040
00:39:22.847 --> 00:39:24.615
- Please put on your earphones. - Wait. This is...

1041
00:39:24.615 --> 00:39:26.751
As you've seen before, look how good Ji Hyo is at this.

1042
00:39:26.751 --> 00:39:28.886
- We must be very observant. - I must follow Ji Hyo's decision.

1043
00:39:28.886 --> 00:39:30.054
I'm going to get it right now.

1044
00:39:30.488 --> 00:39:32.089
All right. We'll play the clip now.

1045
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:33.624
Play the video.

1046
00:39:33.624 --> 00:39:34.725
(Who will get the penalty badge?)

1047
00:39:35.259 --> 00:39:38.996
(The 2nd question of Tiger Moth Tour)

1048
00:39:38.996 --> 00:39:40.965
Why did you bring that here?

1049
00:39:40.965 --> 00:39:42.466
You wouldn't even play with it.

1050
00:39:42.566 --> 00:39:44.168
Tell him you'll give him the money and do it again.

1051
00:39:44.735 --> 00:39:46.370
- Kwang Soo... - Can't I get a chance with money?

1052
00:39:47.805 --> 00:39:49.206
I will sell this device.

1053
00:39:49.206 --> 00:39:50.474
(He's selling it rather hurriedly.)

1054
00:39:50.474 --> 00:39:51.709
It's expensive.

1055
00:39:51.709 --> 00:39:54.145
All right. First off, take out your gaming device.

1056
00:39:54.278 --> 00:39:57.314
- I don't need this. - If that's the case,

1057
00:39:57.314 --> 00:39:59.817
give me five dollars, and I'll give you another chance.

1058
00:39:59.817 --> 00:40:01.519
- Just one. - What do you think? Should we pay?

1059
00:40:02.186 --> 00:40:03.354
Pay him, and let's do it again.

1060
00:40:03.354 --> 00:40:05.356
You gave me 2 dollars and 3 dollars.

1061
00:40:05.356 --> 00:40:06.791
(They earn another chance after paying 5 dollars.)

1062
00:40:06.991 --> 00:40:09.126
I counted the money, and it's five dollars.

1063
00:40:09.126 --> 00:40:10.628
(Let's do well this time.)

1064
00:40:10.628 --> 00:40:11.796
- It's So Min's turn. - Okay.

1065
00:40:11.796 --> 00:40:14.465
Take out the gaming device. You might select that again.

1066
00:40:14.799 --> 00:40:16.367
- That's so big. - The controllers...

1067
00:40:16.367 --> 00:40:17.868
(The controllers are separate.)

1068
00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:20.137
- The controllers... - Let me throw it this time.

1069
00:40:20.137 --> 00:40:21.405
I can't take them out?

1070
00:40:21.605 --> 00:40:24.275
- I can take them out too, can't I? - They are part of the device too.

1071
00:40:24.475 --> 00:40:27.545
- I can take them out though. - Take out the device only.

1072
00:40:27.678 --> 00:40:28.779
(What?)

1073
00:40:28.779 --> 00:40:31.615
You could've taken them out together if they were connected.

1074
00:40:33.017 --> 00:40:34.085
(Whispering)

1075
00:40:35.886 --> 00:40:37.054
She told me to hit you once.

1076
00:40:37.054 --> 00:40:38.055
(Producer, let me hit you.)

1077
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:41.325
This device has neither the cables nor the controllers.

1078
00:40:41.759 --> 00:40:44.328
The only thing I can do with this is to hit someone.

1079
00:40:44.328 --> 00:40:46.030
(It's heavy.)

1080
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.766
- That's the only thing I can do. - Fine.

1081
00:40:48.766 --> 00:40:51.368
- You can take out the controllers. - This is bad.

1082
00:40:51.368 --> 00:40:52.837
- Okay. - We'll let you do that.

1083
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.939
- He ought to exclude them. - That's right.

1084
00:40:55.406 --> 00:40:57.575
Kwang Soo, move. Let me practice.

1085
00:40:57.575 --> 00:40:59.477
(Kwang Soo, move. Let me practice.)

1086
00:41:00.444 --> 00:41:01.479
(Throwing)

1087
00:41:04.148 --> 00:41:05.316
Hey.

1088
00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.885
What are you doing? I can't exactly go into your room.

1089
00:41:09.887 --> 00:41:11.689
- Come on! - Don't say something like that!

1090
00:41:11.689 --> 00:41:13.190
- Your lines are so lame. - No, the rule...

1091
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.625
- It was the rule. - That was terrible.

1092
00:41:14.825 --> 00:41:16.727
- That was the rule of the game. - Your line is disgusting.

1093
00:41:16.727 --> 00:41:18.596
That's the worst line of today.

1094
00:41:18.696 --> 00:41:20.164
- It's really disgusting. - What's wrong with you?

1095
00:41:20.564 --> 00:41:21.966
It was like a joke.

1096
00:41:21.966 --> 00:41:24.635
- It was harder than it looked. - What was that?

1097
00:41:25.336 --> 00:41:28.205
(No one is interested in this fleeting romance.)

1098
00:41:28.739 --> 00:41:30.775
- You may start now. - Okay.

1099
00:41:31.108 --> 00:41:33.477
- Let's go. We can do this. - I'll try now.

1100
00:41:33.878 --> 00:41:35.045
Let me try it.

1101
00:41:35.045 --> 00:41:36.247
- You'll try it now. - Yes.

1102
00:41:37.047 --> 00:41:41.585
(She desperately needs toiletries to wash away her long day.)

1103
00:41:41.585 --> 00:41:44.255
(Will her coin land on the toiletries?)

1104
00:41:44.655 --> 00:41:46.056
(It did land on something.)

1105
00:41:46.056 --> 00:41:47.124
Where did it go?

1106
00:41:48.325 --> 00:41:49.326
Where is it?

1107
00:41:50.161 --> 00:41:52.029
(It lands on top of the padded vest.)

1108
00:41:52.029 --> 00:41:53.864
- It fell here. - It did fall on top of that.

1109
00:41:54.298 --> 00:41:56.167
They aren't clothes.

1110
00:41:56.167 --> 00:41:57.735
- It's your padded vest. - What is this?

1111
00:41:57.735 --> 00:42:01.005
- Why did you bring it to Indonesia? - I mean...

1112
00:42:01.005 --> 00:42:02.807
I wrapped the gaming device with this to avoid breaking it.

1113
00:42:02.807 --> 00:42:04.975
(I didn't have bubble wraps.)

1114
00:42:04.975 --> 00:42:06.777
I didn't bring this to wear.

1115
00:42:07.545 --> 00:42:10.714
- Congratulations. - I wrapped the device with this.

1116
00:42:11.515 --> 00:42:13.350
You think I'm crazy? Why would I bring this...

1117
00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.219
- to Indonesia? - This is a duck down vest.

1118
00:42:15.219 --> 00:42:16.287
(It looks warm.)

1119
00:42:16.287 --> 00:42:18.355
This isn't the end. Aren't you hungry?

1120
00:42:19.056 --> 00:42:20.925
- Why don't you have your meal? - Goodness.

1121
00:42:22.026 --> 00:42:23.227
What do I wear tomorrow then?

1122
00:42:23.294 --> 00:42:24.428
Wear this.

1123
00:42:25.129 --> 00:42:26.330
I don't need this.

1124
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.766
(They head to the restaurant with the warm, padded vest.)

1125
00:42:28.766 --> 00:42:30.434
Hey, what time was that?

1126
00:42:30.434 --> 00:42:31.936
Gosh, you were on a tight schedule.

1127
00:42:31.936 --> 00:42:33.070
We were just starting.

1128
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:34.605
(They began their journey at 9am, but the current time is 11pm.)

1129
00:42:35.105 --> 00:42:37.474
- Aren't you hungry? - Yes.

1130
00:42:37.474 --> 00:42:40.177
We'll start the mission for your dinner.

1131
00:42:41.946 --> 00:42:44.215
How many games did you play?

1132
00:42:44.248 --> 00:42:45.749
- The whole day is over. - It's only the beginning.

1133
00:42:46.517 --> 00:42:47.685
There's a mission for dinner?

1134
00:42:47.685 --> 00:42:49.420
- I'm so sick of missions. - Before...

1135
00:42:49.587 --> 00:42:52.356
Currently, you're carrying out the penalty in Indonesia.

1136
00:42:52.356 --> 00:42:54.158
- You said we'll rest. - We even played...

1137
00:42:54.158 --> 00:42:56.360
games from the flight to Indonesia because she wanted to play games.

1138
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.996
Did I hear it wrong? He said we'll have to do a mission?

1139
00:42:58.996 --> 00:43:00.497
We're going to start a mission for your dinner.

1140
00:43:00.497 --> 00:43:04.635
Take out an item that you need from your luggage.

1141
00:43:04.668 --> 00:43:05.836
It's the luggage again.

1142
00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.304
- The luggage? - Take out an item...

1143
00:43:07.304 --> 00:43:08.739
- from the luggage. - Just one?

1144
00:43:08.739 --> 00:43:09.907
(It's a special chance for them.)

1145
00:43:09.907 --> 00:43:12.776
(They take out an item they need from their luggage.)

1146
00:43:13.544 --> 00:43:14.745
Take out only one item.

1147
00:43:14.745 --> 00:43:16.680
- Will you take out toiletries? - Yes.

1148
00:43:17.414 --> 00:43:18.649
I got mine.

1149
00:43:19.016 --> 00:43:21.485
- You took out your toiletries. - Yes.

1150
00:43:21.585 --> 00:43:22.987
- What about you, So Min? - Wait, no.

1151
00:43:22.987 --> 00:43:24.555
I should take out the outfit for tomorrow.

1152
00:43:24.788 --> 00:43:26.457
I can't take out the whole outfit?

1153
00:43:26.457 --> 00:43:27.558
(A whole outfit)

1154
00:43:27.558 --> 00:43:28.926
- Should I allow that? - Yes, please.

1155
00:43:28.926 --> 00:43:31.195
- But that's not fair. - So...

1156
00:43:31.195 --> 00:43:34.064
I'm okay with that, but the viewers might think it's unfair.

1157
00:43:34.064 --> 00:43:35.165
Hey, shut your mouth.

1158
00:43:36.166 --> 00:43:39.136
It looks like he's favoring you.

1159
00:43:39.136 --> 00:43:41.405
Just take out one item that you really need.

1160
00:43:41.438 --> 00:43:42.539
Pants.

1161
00:43:43.207 --> 00:43:46.277
Pants. Which one should I wear?

1162
00:43:46.277 --> 00:43:47.544
(She's seriously worried.)

1163
00:43:47.544 --> 00:43:49.346
They look the same. Why are you thinking about this?

1164
00:43:49.446 --> 00:43:51.415
- No, they're different. - What?

1165
00:43:52.016 --> 00:43:55.185
- They're different. - I thought you had the same pants.

1166
00:43:55.286 --> 00:43:57.454
How are they different? Even the lengths are the same.

1167
00:43:57.454 --> 00:43:59.056
This pair has buttons, and this pair has a zipper.

1168
00:43:59.056 --> 00:44:01.025
This is a high-waist pair.

1169
00:44:01.325 --> 00:44:03.360
But no one will know about the buttons or the zipper except you.

1170
00:44:04.028 --> 00:44:05.429
Please choose one for me.

1171
00:44:05.429 --> 00:44:07.197
(Stop talking, and choose one.)

1172
00:44:07.197 --> 00:44:08.365
That one.

1173
00:44:09.199 --> 00:44:11.235
- This one? This? Okay. - Yes.

1174
00:44:11.235 --> 00:44:13.671
(She chose a pair of pants with buttons for tomorrow.)

1175
00:44:13.804 --> 00:44:14.805
All right.

1176
00:44:14.805 --> 00:44:16.707
It does look like they're on their honeymoon.

1177
00:44:17.675 --> 00:44:20.144
You'll have your meal soon. Bring the food in, please.

1178
00:44:20.144 --> 00:44:21.345
(It's time for dinner they've been waiting for.)

1179
00:44:21.745 --> 00:44:23.714
- Thank you. This looks tasty. - What is that?

1180
00:44:23.714 --> 00:44:27.184
Your dinner will be a traditional dish of Indonesia.

1181
00:44:27.184 --> 00:44:28.886
This is Indonesian stir-fried rice, nasi goreng.

1182
00:44:29.086 --> 00:44:30.688
I know this dish.

1183
00:44:30.688 --> 00:44:33.157
And this is called ikan gurame.

1184
00:44:33.157 --> 00:44:35.125
This is made with a fish called gurame.

1185
00:44:35.259 --> 00:44:36.827
I see. This is a gurame.

1186
00:44:37.027 --> 00:44:38.829
All right. You can...

1187
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:41.966
only eat this through your decisions.

1188
00:44:42.266 --> 00:44:44.568
Your choice, the mission for your dinner.

1189
00:44:44.668 --> 00:44:47.204
Will you choose the item you need?

1190
00:44:47.204 --> 00:44:50.140
Or will you choose delicious dishes to fill your empty stomach?

1191
00:44:51.008 --> 00:44:56.146
(Will they choose the item they need or the food to fill their hunger?)

1192
00:44:56.747 --> 00:45:00.017
Depending on your choices, you can get either the item or food.

1193
00:45:00.484 --> 00:45:01.785
To be honest, I'm hungry.

1194
00:45:03.587 --> 00:45:05.289
This is a new way of stressing me out.

1195
00:45:05.289 --> 00:45:06.457
(To wash or to eat.)

1196
00:45:06.457 --> 00:45:07.825
This isn't a team mission, is it?

1197
00:45:07.825 --> 00:45:10.327
- She can choose the pants or this. - That's correct.

1198
00:45:10.627 --> 00:45:12.296
I can choose either the toiletries or the food.

1199
00:45:12.596 --> 00:45:15.866
I'll choose the pants. You should choose the food and share it.

1200
00:45:15.866 --> 00:45:16.934
You want us to share?

1201
00:45:16.934 --> 00:45:19.136
I'll choose the toiletries. Or you can pay me two dollars.

1202
00:45:20.504 --> 00:45:22.139
Give me two dollars in exchange. Or this deal is off.

1203
00:45:22.206 --> 00:45:23.307
Okay. Hurry.

1204
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.776
- We don't have time. I'm hungry. - Let's rock-paper-scissors.

1205
00:45:25.776 --> 00:45:27.544
- And then what? - The loser will pay two dollars.

1206
00:45:28.379 --> 00:45:31.115
- The loser can make a choice. - If I lose,

1207
00:45:31.115 --> 00:45:33.217
I'll give you two dollars and take my toiletries.

1208
00:45:33.217 --> 00:45:34.685
- And we share the food. I'm in. - Yes.

1209
00:45:34.885 --> 00:45:36.186
Rock-paper-scissors.

1210
00:45:36.387 --> 00:45:38.288
(So Min wins.)

1211
00:45:39.056 --> 00:45:41.158
Give me two dollars. Give it to me.

1212
00:45:41.925 --> 00:45:44.395
- I'll save up 30 dollars like this. - I have to take out a loan soon.

1213
00:45:44.395 --> 00:45:46.130
And it'd be better for me to buy the items.

1214
00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:47.965
- Give me my two dollars. - What's happening now?

1215
00:45:47.965 --> 00:45:49.867
I'll choose the stir-fried rice.

1216
00:45:49.867 --> 00:45:52.736
Then I'll choose the toiletries, okay?

1217
00:45:52.736 --> 00:45:53.804
All right.

1218
00:45:54.405 --> 00:45:56.306
- We'll take out the pants. - Okay.

1219
00:45:56.407 --> 00:45:57.408
I chose the toiletries.

1220
00:45:57.808 --> 00:45:59.176
I used up all of the singles.

1221
00:45:59.176 --> 00:46:00.477
(Kwang Soo pays 2 dollars.)

1222
00:46:00.778 --> 00:46:02.146
Try this. This is good.

1223
00:46:02.146 --> 00:46:03.280
(A tasty dish brings peace to them.)

1224
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.715
I think this is a spicy pepper.

1225
00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:07.317
- Was it good? - It was so good.

1226
00:46:07.317 --> 00:46:08.519
- It's really tasty. - This is delicious.

1227
00:46:11.855 --> 00:46:13.824
- It smells great. - It's like it's their honeymoon.

1228
00:46:13.824 --> 00:46:15.325
- But they don't like each other. - It's good.

1229
00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:16.827
- They were forced to get married. - Exactly.

1230
00:46:16.827 --> 00:46:19.396
(They're quite at last. They're finally in peace.)

1231
00:46:19.396 --> 00:46:20.764
I really like the rice.

1232
00:46:20.764 --> 00:46:22.066
I like how dry it is.

1233
00:46:22.066 --> 00:46:23.567
- You like it dry? - Isn't it tasty?

1234
00:46:23.967 --> 00:46:25.736
What do people call this kind of rice?

1235
00:46:26.136 --> 00:46:28.839
(He's referring to Annam rice.)

1236
00:46:28.839 --> 00:46:31.675
- Wasn't the rice offered to Buddha? - No, that wasn't it.

1237
00:46:31.675 --> 00:46:33.677
(There he turns into a klutz again.)

1238
00:46:33.677 --> 00:46:35.779
That's from the story of Simcheong, and she offered 300 rice bags.

1239
00:46:36.046 --> 00:46:37.114
Oh, right.

1240
00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:40.984
You're going to lend me the cleansing foam, right?

1241
00:46:40.984 --> 00:46:41.985
(I'm sharing my food.)

1242
00:46:45.456 --> 00:46:46.657
Why aren't you answering me?

1243
00:46:47.758 --> 00:46:49.126
- You'll let me borrow it, right? - For a dollar.

1244
00:46:49.359 --> 00:46:50.694
- No. - For a dollar.

1245
00:46:51.195 --> 00:46:52.629
- You ate my food. - What are you doing?

1246
00:46:52.796 --> 00:46:54.364
You're eating my food, and you also took the toiletries.

1247
00:46:54.665 --> 00:46:56.500
It's so hard to meddle with you right now.

1248
00:46:57.234 --> 00:46:58.936
I hate this power struggle with you.

1249
00:46:58.936 --> 00:47:00.404
Promise me in front of the cameras.

1250
00:47:00.404 --> 00:47:01.705
That you're going to lend me your cleansing foam.

1251
00:47:01.939 --> 00:47:02.940
For a dollar,

1252
00:47:04.308 --> 00:47:05.609
I'll lend you the toothbrush and cleansing foam.

1253
00:47:06.276 --> 00:47:08.178
Then stop eating. Don't eat.

1254
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.449
Didn't I pay for this fair and square? I gave you two dollars.

1255
00:47:14.318 --> 00:47:16.186
This is so interesting. What is this?

1256
00:47:16.186 --> 00:47:17.354
(I can't hear anything.)

1257
00:47:17.754 --> 00:47:19.089
For a dollar, I'll lend you a toothbrush, toothpaste,

1258
00:47:19.089 --> 00:47:20.424
shampoo, and conditioner.

1259
00:47:20.824 --> 00:47:21.925
I can't give you more than these.

1260
00:47:21.925 --> 00:47:23.794
- You get shampoo and conditioner. - Then take just a spoonful.

1261
00:47:24.595 --> 00:47:25.696
Goodness.

1262
00:47:25.696 --> 00:47:27.998
(How can she be so mean? Who is this girl?)

1263
00:47:29.166 --> 00:47:31.235
You made a promise. Have your spoonful, and give up.

1264
00:47:31.835 --> 00:47:32.936
Eat up.

1265
00:47:34.404 --> 00:47:35.539
Fine.

1266
00:47:38.976 --> 00:47:41.278
(Gobbling up)

1267
00:47:42.746 --> 00:47:45.616
(I'll only have a mouthful.)

1268
00:47:47.784 --> 00:47:50.587
(He eats every grain of leftover rice on the plate.)

1269
00:47:51.255 --> 00:47:52.756
Don't you think this is too much?

1270
00:47:57.094 --> 00:47:58.095
Give me 50 cents.

1271
00:47:58.829 --> 00:48:00.230
You ate 50-cents' worth of food. Give me 50 cents.

1272
00:48:00.764 --> 00:48:01.798
That would be 50 cents.

1273
00:48:02.666 --> 00:48:03.834
I won't give you the money.

1274
00:48:03.967 --> 00:48:05.936
- Why? - I had a change of heart.

1275
00:48:05.936 --> 00:48:07.204
(He changes his attitude.)

1276
00:48:07.504 --> 00:48:10.007
(Why?)

1277
00:48:10.107 --> 00:48:11.875
I didn't say out loud that I was going to pay you.

1278
00:48:12.709 --> 00:48:14.545
(He is true to his reputation.)

1279
00:48:14.545 --> 00:48:16.246
I don't need to pay you, and I won't lend you the toiletries.

1280
00:48:18.815 --> 00:48:21.818
(Now that he's been fed, he's feeling sleepy.)

1281
00:48:21.818 --> 00:48:22.886
Excuse me?

1282
00:48:24.188 --> 00:48:25.355
Excuse me?

1283
00:48:25.355 --> 00:48:26.390
(What a jerk.)

1284
00:48:27.257 --> 00:48:28.358
Give me water, please.

1285
00:48:30.994 --> 00:48:32.029
Water, please.

1286
00:48:32.429 --> 00:48:33.964
(He's very satisfied with the stir-fried rice.)

1287
00:48:33.964 --> 00:48:35.165
This is good.

1288
00:48:35.766 --> 00:48:37.234
Give me. You said you'll give me the money.

1289
00:48:37.234 --> 00:48:38.669
I got you on the cameras.

1290
00:48:38.669 --> 00:48:40.337
It's a promise you made with your fans in Indonesia.

1291
00:48:40.437 --> 00:48:41.605
No matter how hard...

1292
00:48:43.006 --> 00:48:45.676
Why are you bringing my fans into this?

1293
00:48:46.276 --> 00:48:48.679
This is a promise with all those fans at the airport.

1294
00:48:48.679 --> 00:48:50.047
(We believe in you, Kwang Soo.)

1295
00:48:50.047 --> 00:48:51.348
As the Prince of Asia...

1296
00:48:51.348 --> 00:48:52.849
You're talking trash.

1297
00:48:53.417 --> 00:48:54.685
What on earth are you saying?

1298
00:48:54.685 --> 00:48:55.919
Keep your promise.

1299
00:48:55.919 --> 00:48:57.487
(The first meal of Tiger Moth Tour ends with them fighting.)

1300
00:48:58.155 --> 00:49:00.090
You may go to your rooms now.

1301
00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:01.225
(It's 1:30am.)

1302
00:49:01.225 --> 00:49:02.626
After you get some sleep,

1303
00:49:02.626 --> 00:49:04.728
we'll go to Indonesian Manual Wooden Cable Car at last.

1304
00:49:04.728 --> 00:49:05.896
(They go to Manual Wooden Cable Car tomorrow.)

1305
00:49:06.597 --> 00:49:07.898
- Do you have... - I'm not surprised.

1306
00:49:07.898 --> 00:49:10.067
any good news? We heard nothing good today.

1307
00:49:10.067 --> 00:49:13.437
That's why we have good news.

1308
00:49:13.437 --> 00:49:15.205
(Good news?)

1309
00:49:15.405 --> 00:49:18.775
You're given one more chance to open the luggage.

1310
00:49:19.409 --> 00:49:21.545
Here's your second mission to open the luggage.

1311
00:49:21.945 --> 00:49:23.914
It's called It's 4am, Not 4pm.

1312
00:49:23.914 --> 00:49:25.816
(It's 4am, Not 4pm)

1313
00:49:26.817 --> 00:49:29.920
(In Indonesia, it's 4am, Not 4pm?)

1314
00:49:30.287 --> 00:49:31.555
(Was the rhyme intentional?)

1315
00:49:31.555 --> 00:49:32.689
"It's 4am, Not 4pm"?

1316
00:49:32.689 --> 00:49:34.725
- Isn't it incredible? - What a great punch line.

1317
00:49:35.025 --> 00:49:37.594
You mean the good news is...

1318
00:49:38.295 --> 00:49:40.697
you allowing me to take...

1319
00:49:41.064 --> 00:49:43.867
one item out of so many from my luggage?

1320
00:49:44.368 --> 00:49:47.104
(He's speechless.)

1321
00:49:47.104 --> 00:49:49.539
Can you just give back my luggage? It's ridiculous.

1322
00:49:50.674 --> 00:49:52.509
How could you...

1323
00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:55.245
Here's the mission called It's 4am, Not 4pm.

1324
00:49:55.946 --> 00:49:57.814
When it's 4am in Indonesia,

1325
00:49:57.814 --> 00:49:59.449
it's 6am in Korea.

1326
00:49:59.449 --> 00:50:02.319
- Right. - Call other members at that time...

1327
00:50:02.486 --> 00:50:04.254
to proceed the mission.

1328
00:50:04.488 --> 00:50:06.657
You may call any member.

1329
00:50:07.157 --> 00:50:10.160
You fail immediately if you hear any assigned taboo words.

1330
00:50:10.494 --> 00:50:14.164
You get a chance to open the luggage if you succeed.

1331
00:50:14.164 --> 00:50:16.099
The taboo words you have to avoid...

1332
00:50:16.099 --> 00:50:19.169
will be given at 4am at the corridor on the 5th floor.

1333
00:50:19.169 --> 00:50:21.538
Have a good night.

1334
00:50:21.538 --> 00:50:22.606
(They get three hours of sleep.)

1335
00:50:23.206 --> 00:50:26.109
(He's speechless again.)

1336
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:28.045
Look how sad I look.

1337
00:50:28.045 --> 00:50:29.479
(She tears up.)

1338
00:50:29.479 --> 00:50:30.714
You just look sleepy.

1339
00:50:32.015 --> 00:50:33.216
Go to bed now.

1340
00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.086
- Go to bed. - How can I sleep without changing?

1341
00:50:36.486 --> 00:50:38.055
Keep these clothes on.

1342
00:50:38.055 --> 00:50:39.456
Is that all?

1343
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:41.224
Will you give them to me?

1344
00:50:41.325 --> 00:50:43.527
- I'm sorry. - I need to wash up.

1345
00:50:43.527 --> 00:50:45.929
- I don't have much. - I must brush teeth for your sake.

1346
00:50:47.297 --> 00:50:48.999
- That's why... - It's okay.

1347
00:50:49.566 --> 00:50:51.134
I won't talk much with you tomorrow.

1348
00:50:51.134 --> 00:50:52.636
(He won't talk to her tomorrow.)

1349
00:50:54.104 --> 00:50:55.205
Let's go.

1350
00:50:55.205 --> 00:50:57.708
(You're watching Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour.)

1351
00:50:57.908 --> 00:51:01.545
The mission starts at 4am. It must be 1am then.

1352
00:51:01.645 --> 00:51:04.114
We had to clear another mission after three hours.

1353
00:51:04.114 --> 00:51:06.450
- It was terrible. - We had no food or sleep.

1354
00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:08.485
- We couldn't even wash. - We couldn't sleep.

1355
00:51:08.585 --> 00:51:10.554
We can tell from your facial expression.

1356
00:51:10.954 --> 00:51:12.789
It's horrible in Indonesia.

1357
00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:14.624
It must be worse for Nevis Swing.

1358
00:51:15.025 --> 00:51:16.927
- We won't go. - I can imagine.

1359
00:51:17.394 --> 00:51:18.528
No way.

1360
00:51:19.229 --> 00:51:21.365
(He sighs.)

1361
00:51:21.998 --> 00:51:23.066
(They go into their separate rooms.)

1362
00:51:23.066 --> 00:51:25.235
- Here it is. - Lend me your foam cleanser.

1363
00:51:25.335 --> 00:51:27.804
- Please? - This is what I earned.

1364
00:51:28.305 --> 00:51:29.806
I have to wash my hair.

1365
00:51:29.806 --> 00:51:31.375
(She begs Kwang Soo.)

1366
00:51:31.475 --> 00:51:32.509
Please, Kwang Soo.

1367
00:51:33.009 --> 00:51:34.244
I'll lend you the game console.

1368
00:51:34.845 --> 00:51:37.047
What can I do with this? May I sell it?

1369
00:51:38.815 --> 00:51:39.850
What's this?

1370
00:51:41.418 --> 00:51:42.786
May I sell it?

1371
00:51:42.786 --> 00:51:45.155
(He finds something on the game controller.)

1372
00:51:45.155 --> 00:51:46.990
- It's the slime monster. - It is.

1373
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:48.425
It's everywhere.

1374
00:51:49.059 --> 00:51:51.395
It's on all of my items.

1375
00:51:51.795 --> 00:51:53.196
Please, Kwang Soo.

1376
00:51:53.196 --> 00:51:55.565
I beg you, Kwang Soo.

1377
00:51:56.266 --> 00:51:57.667
- What? - Foam cleanser.

1378
00:51:58.335 --> 00:52:01.338
(She begs for his foam cleanser.)

1379
00:52:01.805 --> 00:52:04.708
(Kwang Soo decides to be generous after she begs desperately.)

1380
00:52:05.909 --> 00:52:08.545
- Don't give it to me now. - Take it now.

1381
00:52:08.545 --> 00:52:09.780
How can I use it later?

1382
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.448
(He gives her the foam cleaner on her hand.)

1383
00:52:11.815 --> 00:52:13.150
There isn't even much left.

1384
00:52:14.684 --> 00:52:17.654
(She sighs.)

1385
00:52:19.756 --> 00:52:22.325
How can I use it if you give it to me all at once?

1386
00:52:22.659 --> 00:52:24.694
- Keep it somewhere. - Where?

1387
00:52:24.694 --> 00:52:26.630
What can I do with it?

1388
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:28.165
I can only give it to you now.

1389
00:52:28.165 --> 00:52:29.566
I don't have a place to store it.

1390
00:52:29.566 --> 00:52:30.934
- Give me a plastic bag. - I'll do it carefully.

1391
00:52:30.934 --> 00:52:32.636
- They will get mixed. - Let me do it.

1392
00:52:32.636 --> 00:52:34.504
- They will get mixed. - What's this?

1393
00:52:34.504 --> 00:52:36.506
(What is this?)

1394
00:52:36.706 --> 00:52:40.877
- It's the slime monster. - Why is it here?

1395
00:52:40.877 --> 00:52:41.878
(The slime monster is everywhere.)

1396
00:52:41.878 --> 00:52:44.014
I never opened the bag. How did it get in here?

1397
00:52:44.214 --> 00:52:46.450
- It's the slime monster. - Is it a real monster?

1398
00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:47.517
(What's it made of?)

1399
00:52:48.185 --> 00:52:50.187
- Why is it here? - Where did it come from?

1400
00:52:50.187 --> 00:52:51.288
I don't know.

1401
00:52:54.424 --> 00:52:56.827
Is the monster alive? I keep finding more.

1402
00:52:56.927 --> 00:52:58.094
Seriously.

1403
00:52:58.094 --> 00:53:00.697
- What else can I do? - I can't use it if you give it now.

1404
00:53:01.565 --> 00:53:02.866
Give me a lot of conditioner.

1405
00:53:03.667 --> 00:53:05.435
Give me more. I have long hair.

1406
00:53:05.535 --> 00:53:08.305
- I have long hair too. - My hair is longer.

1407
00:53:08.305 --> 00:53:09.639
(They argue about hair length.)

1408
00:53:09.639 --> 00:53:11.475
I'll help you later.

1409
00:53:11.575 --> 00:53:14.744
Give me more. That's enough only for the tip of my hair.

1410
00:53:14.845 --> 00:53:16.146
I need to wash the back.

1411
00:53:16.146 --> 00:53:18.615
Use the soap. I don't have much left.

1412
00:53:18.849 --> 00:53:20.617
There's no soap either.

1413
00:53:21.184 --> 00:53:22.385
Hey, stop it.

1414
00:53:22.385 --> 00:53:23.587
(They argue over little things.)

1415
00:53:23.587 --> 00:53:25.555
Give me some toothpaste.

1416
00:53:26.056 --> 00:53:27.424
Are we prisoners?

1417
00:53:27.924 --> 00:53:29.759
- What are we doing? - Are we prisoners?

1418
00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.330
What's the reason? Is this necessary?

1419
00:53:33.763 --> 00:53:36.399
You're on Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour to be penalized.

1420
00:53:36.666 --> 00:53:38.935
Are they on "The Law of Jungle"?

1421
00:53:38.935 --> 00:53:40.337
It's terrible.

1422
00:53:40.337 --> 00:53:41.438
(Around 4am)

1423
00:53:41.438 --> 00:53:42.806
It was so tiring.

1424
00:53:43.807 --> 00:53:46.376
(2 minutes before 4am)

1425
00:53:48.578 --> 00:53:50.146
Hello.

1426
00:53:50.247 --> 00:53:52.649
- What time is it over there? - She looks like a frog.

1427
00:53:52.649 --> 00:53:53.717
It's 4am.

1428
00:53:53.717 --> 00:53:55.318
- My face was swollen. - She looks like a frog.

1429
00:53:55.318 --> 00:53:56.720
(What's going on?)

1430
00:54:01.324 --> 00:54:02.325
Hello.

1431
00:54:02.659 --> 00:54:04.194
He's a ghost in the subway.

1432
00:54:04.794 --> 00:54:06.096
He looks like a wrestler.

1433
00:54:06.596 --> 00:54:09.666
Current time 4:01am.

1434
00:54:09.699 --> 00:54:11.167
(It's 6am in Korea.)

1435
00:54:12.035 --> 00:54:15.605
The luggage in the 7th floor lobby is open.

1436
00:54:16.306 --> 00:54:18.375
- Pardon me? - You may not go.

1437
00:54:18.375 --> 00:54:20.076
The member to clear the mission...

1438
00:54:20.176 --> 00:54:21.845
may take...

1439
00:54:22.746 --> 00:54:26.116
the items of his or her choice in the black bag.

1440
00:54:26.116 --> 00:54:27.484
(Pack your items in the black bag.)

1441
00:54:27.484 --> 00:54:28.885
Is this necessary?

1442
00:54:29.586 --> 00:54:31.555
Just give me my things.

1443
00:54:32.255 --> 00:54:33.456
Please.

1444
00:54:34.057 --> 00:54:37.327
You may move once you get another member on the phone.

1445
00:54:37.327 --> 00:54:39.796
You must keep them on the line until you take your items.

1446
00:54:40.196 --> 00:54:42.766
You aren't allowed to tell them not to hang up.

1447
00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:45.735
You fail the mission if the other says the taboo words.

1448
00:54:45.735 --> 00:54:46.736
(The other must not say the taboo words.)

1449
00:54:46.736 --> 00:54:48.505
He can't say the taboo words or hang up?

1450
00:54:48.505 --> 00:54:49.606
Right.

1451
00:54:49.706 --> 00:54:54.444
The taboo words are "Let me sleep" or "I'm going to sleep."

1452
00:54:54.778 --> 00:54:56.479
Please start the mission.

1453
00:54:58.148 --> 00:55:01.284
(So Min tries calling someone right away.)

1454
00:55:04.888 --> 00:55:08.058
- Hello? - Se Chan.

1455
00:55:08.058 --> 00:55:09.826
I had an event,

1456
00:55:10.026 --> 00:55:11.728
so I was at the airport back then.

1457
00:55:11.728 --> 00:55:13.597
- I see. - It's me.

1458
00:55:13.597 --> 00:55:14.764
(She gets lucky.)

1459
00:55:14.764 --> 00:55:15.899
Hello, So Min.

1460
00:55:16.766 --> 00:55:18.234
(She must prolong the call.)

1461
00:55:18.234 --> 00:55:19.536
- What's up? - Se Chan.

1462
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.237
By the way...

1463
00:55:22.405 --> 00:55:24.374
Can you sing me a song?

1464
00:55:24.374 --> 00:55:25.475
(She asks for a song.)

1465
00:55:25.475 --> 00:55:26.776
What? A song?

1466
00:55:26.776 --> 00:55:28.345
Can you sing me a song?

1467
00:55:28.345 --> 00:55:29.946
(She asks him to sing at 6am.)

1468
00:55:29.946 --> 00:55:33.016
- Are you drunk? - No, I'm not.

1469
00:55:33.016 --> 00:55:34.117
(She sounds drunk.)

1470
00:55:34.117 --> 00:55:35.285
What's going on?

1471
00:55:36.019 --> 00:55:38.355
I thought she was drunk. She kept saying nonsense.

1472
00:55:38.488 --> 00:55:41.725
It'd be funny if Se Chan said something strange.

1473
00:55:42.325 --> 00:55:43.460
(I couldn't sleep at the thought of you.)

1474
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.628
I'd be in trouble.

1475
00:55:45.629 --> 00:55:48.164
I'll call Seok Jin first.

1476
00:55:48.164 --> 00:55:49.666
(He calls Seok Jin.)

1477
00:55:51.735 --> 00:55:54.104
- Did you call me? - Seok Jin wouldn't pick up.

1478
00:55:54.104 --> 00:55:56.406
- I bet he's sleeping. - I couldn't answer.

1479
00:55:56.706 --> 00:55:58.808
(He's not helpful at all.)

1480
00:55:58.808 --> 00:56:00.110
How about Jae Seok?

1481
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:01.544
(He calls Jae Seok next.)

1482
00:56:01.544 --> 00:56:04.414
(Will diligent Jae Seok pick up?)

1483
00:56:04.414 --> 00:56:06.316
- I couldn't hear the phone ring. - You couldn't?

1484
00:56:06.316 --> 00:56:07.584
You called me back.

1485
00:56:07.584 --> 00:56:09.119
I called you back later.

1486
00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:11.254
I think he's sleeping. I'll try Se Chan.

1487
00:56:12.088 --> 00:56:14.124
The number you have dialed is busy.

1488
00:56:15.158 --> 00:56:16.459
It must be So Min.

1489
00:56:17.994 --> 00:56:19.696
- Hello? - Se Chan.

1490
00:56:19.696 --> 00:56:20.797
(She enters the 7th floor lobby.)

1491
00:56:20.797 --> 00:56:23.500
Can you sing me a song please?

1492
00:56:25.335 --> 00:56:27.504
- Are you drunk? - No I'm not.

1493
00:56:27.504 --> 00:56:30.040
Why would I drink at work?

1494
00:56:30.874 --> 00:56:32.575
It's so out of the blue.

1495
00:56:32.709 --> 00:56:36.980
It's because I suddenly missed you.

1496
00:56:38.214 --> 00:56:39.416
What time is it over there?

1497
00:56:39.616 --> 00:56:42.118
Can you sing me a song?

1498
00:56:42.118 --> 00:56:43.486
He's such a gentleman.

1499
00:56:43.486 --> 00:56:46.256
- What? - You have a good voice.

1500
00:56:46.256 --> 00:56:47.424
(You have a good voice, Se Chan.)

1501
00:56:48.825 --> 00:56:50.226
Right now,

1502
00:56:51.695 --> 00:56:53.530
I'm tired.

1503
00:56:55.765 --> 00:56:58.835
I can't sing for you now.

1504
00:56:59.636 --> 00:57:00.704
Really?

1505
00:57:00.704 --> 00:57:02.505
He was close to saying the words.

1506
00:57:02.505 --> 00:57:05.075
- Normally... - Are you on a mission?

1507
00:57:05.075 --> 00:57:06.276
(She has to hurry before he hangs up!)

1508
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:07.944
- Are you on a mission? - Me?

1509
00:57:09.145 --> 00:57:10.613
- Yes. - No, I'm not.

1510
00:57:11.815 --> 00:57:13.216
- It's not that. - Really?

1511
00:57:13.216 --> 00:57:15.785
Excuse me, but where are my pants with buttons?

1512
00:57:16.286 --> 00:57:17.854
You took them from me.

1513
00:57:17.854 --> 00:57:18.955
It's nothing.

1514
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:21.324
(Meanwhile...)

1515
00:57:21.324 --> 00:57:22.826
I'll call Haha.

1516
00:57:22.826 --> 00:57:24.828
(He tries to call Haha this time.)

1517
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:29.065
- He wouldn't pick up. - Of course not.

1518
00:57:29.065 --> 00:57:31.234
- He would be sleeping. - He's sleeping.

1519
00:57:31.234 --> 00:57:32.936
He wouldn't pick up.

1520
00:57:37.006 --> 00:57:38.908
Why does everyone sleep so much?

1521
00:57:39.576 --> 00:57:42.245
I'll try Jong Kook. He recently finished a project.

1522
00:57:45.014 --> 00:57:48.017
(He failed again.)

1523
00:57:49.119 --> 00:57:51.187
I heard the phone ringing, but I didn't pick up.

1524
00:57:51.187 --> 00:57:52.188
Really?

1525
00:57:52.188 --> 00:57:53.656
Who would anyone be up at 6am?

1526
00:57:53.656 --> 00:57:56.559
When he calls me early in the morning, he's usually drunk.

1527
00:57:56.559 --> 00:57:58.328
That's why I don't pick up any calls at that time.

1528
00:57:58.328 --> 00:57:59.796
(Kwang Soo likes drunk dialing.)

1529
00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:01.297
(Sad)

1530
00:58:01.297 --> 00:58:02.365
(Why don't you try calling Ji Hyo?)

1531
00:58:02.365 --> 00:58:03.967
Why don't you try calling Ji Hyo?

1532
00:58:04.067 --> 00:58:05.835
She'd be sleeping anyway.

1533
00:58:06.336 --> 00:58:08.605
(She's only awake in the afternoon.)

1534
00:58:08.605 --> 00:58:10.106
She's definitely sleeping.

1535
00:58:11.007 --> 00:58:14.644
(He tries calling Ji Hyo as his last hope.)

1536
00:58:16.646 --> 00:58:18.214
- Change the caller ringtone please. - Okay.

1537
00:58:18.214 --> 00:58:20.416
- She's had it for four years. - I'm tired of it.

1538
00:58:29.534 --> 00:58:31.194
Why don't you try calling Ji Hyo?

1539
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:32.926
She'd be sleeping anyway.

1540
00:58:34.197 --> 00:58:35.806
(She's only awake in the afternoon.)

1541
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.200
She's definitely sleeping.

1542
00:58:38.201 --> 00:58:41.204
(He tries calling Ji Hyo as his last hope.)

1543
00:58:43.854 --> 00:58:45.342
- Change the caller ringtone please. - Okay.

1544
00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:47.662
- She's had it for four years. - I'm tired of it.

1545
00:58:50.814 --> 00:58:52.310
- Kwang Soo. - Ji Hyo.

1546
00:58:52.315 --> 00:58:53.650
(She's awake at this hour?)

1547
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:54.918
- Yes? - Why are you awake?

1548
00:58:56.753 --> 00:58:58.321
I'm with someone.

1549
00:58:58.788 --> 00:59:00.790
- What? - Where are you?

1550
00:59:01.324 --> 00:59:02.525
I'm in Indonesia.

1551
00:59:03.927 --> 00:59:05.995
Where in Indonesia are you? I'm in Indonesia too.

1552
00:59:05.995 --> 00:59:07.764
Right. You're in Indonesia too, right?

1553
00:59:07.931 --> 00:59:10.133
- You were in Indonesia? - She was in Indonesia too.

1554
00:59:10.133 --> 00:59:11.201
- Really? - Really?

1555
00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:13.069
- That's unbelievable. - You had a shoot?

1556
00:59:14.003 --> 00:59:15.071
Really?

1557
00:59:16.039 --> 00:59:17.507
I was so surprised.

1558
00:59:17.507 --> 00:59:20.476
I have to go. We've been talking for eight minutes.

1559
00:59:21.678 --> 00:59:22.779
Are you hanging up on me?

1560
00:59:23.546 --> 00:59:25.815
Bye. I have to go.

1561
00:59:26.149 --> 00:59:27.884
Really? Okay.

1562
00:59:28.151 --> 00:59:29.652
(Kwang Soo appears.)

1563
00:59:29.652 --> 00:59:30.687
I mean...

1564
00:59:31.354 --> 00:59:33.156
- Bye. - How long will you be here?

1565
00:59:33.356 --> 00:59:34.457
Bye.

1566
00:59:37.026 --> 00:59:39.262
- Really? - Sorry?

1567
00:59:39.262 --> 00:59:41.865
Is this all the hats? I brought more.

1568
00:59:41.865 --> 00:59:43.499
(Kwang Soo has to buy time.)

1569
00:59:43.499 --> 00:59:45.568
- Hey. - Who is it?

1570
00:59:46.135 --> 00:59:47.136
Did you have breakfast?

1571
00:59:47.971 --> 00:59:49.038
Who is it?

1572
00:59:49.839 --> 00:59:50.840
Did you have breakfast?

1573
00:59:52.842 --> 00:59:54.510
Aren't you tired?

1574
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:56.012
Get some sleep.

1575
00:59:56.479 --> 00:59:57.513
Hey.

1576
00:59:57.513 --> 00:59:58.581
Ji Hyo.

1577
00:59:58.581 --> 01:00:02.018
(Kwang Soo is angry.)

1578
01:00:02.652 --> 01:00:05.555
He looks seriously angry.

1579
01:00:05.822 --> 01:00:07.490
I don't remember it.

1580
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:08.892
- That's hilarious. - I don't remember it.

1581
01:00:09.092 --> 01:00:11.995
Why are you awake at this hour?

1582
01:00:11.995 --> 01:00:13.396
Aren't you tired?

1583
01:00:13.396 --> 01:00:15.565
She's okay. Her voice sounds fine.

1584
01:00:15.565 --> 01:00:18.167
I'll call you soon.

1585
01:00:18.835 --> 01:00:19.903
Ji Hyo.

1586
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:22.739
(Kwang Soo focuses on moving the stuff.)

1587
01:00:22.805 --> 01:00:24.007
It fits.

1588
01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:26.309
So Min is calling me.

1589
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:28.111
- Don't get it. She's drunk. - Please answer it.

1590
01:00:29.212 --> 01:00:31.414
- She's drunk. - Ji Hyo.

1591
01:00:31.414 --> 01:00:32.515
(I'm not drunk.)

1592
01:00:32.515 --> 01:00:34.450
- She's drunk. - I thought she really was drunk.

1593
01:00:35.184 --> 01:00:37.120
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

1594
01:00:37.754 --> 01:00:38.788
Ji Hyo.

1595
01:00:39.989 --> 01:00:42.825
Ji Hyo, this is So Min.

1596
01:00:43.192 --> 01:00:45.895
(So Min is talking to Ji Hyo?)

1597
01:00:45.895 --> 01:00:47.697
- She hung up on me. - This is So Min.

1598
01:00:48.564 --> 01:00:50.433
Why are you awake?

1599
01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:53.903
It's too late. Go to bed.

1600
01:00:53.937 --> 01:00:54.971
(I still have a lot left.)

1601
01:00:54.971 --> 01:00:55.972
Call me later.

1602
01:00:58.608 --> 01:01:00.643
You're definitely going to Australia.

1603
01:01:00.643 --> 01:01:01.644
(So Min, I'm taking you to Australia.)

1604
01:01:02.445 --> 01:01:03.880
(After three hours of war,)

1605
01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.914
(the penalty day starts.)

1606
01:01:04.914 --> 01:01:05.915
Good morning.

1607
01:01:05.915 --> 01:01:07.617
(After three hours of war, the penalty day starts.)

1608
01:01:07.617 --> 01:01:08.985
Aren't we jumping today?

1609
01:01:08.985 --> 01:01:11.087
(We should teleport.)

1610
01:01:11.087 --> 01:01:12.822
Let's jump to the cable car.

1611
01:01:13.289 --> 01:01:14.357
- To the cable car? - Yes.

1612
01:01:14.357 --> 01:01:15.358
Isn't it...

1613
01:01:16.526 --> 01:01:17.527
Let's try.

1614
01:01:18.294 --> 01:01:20.697
Please use the best one.

1615
01:01:20.697 --> 01:01:21.698
(We'll jump many times.)

1616
01:01:21.698 --> 01:01:22.865
1, 2, 3.

1617
01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:28.571
- They used it. - You used it.

1618
01:01:28.571 --> 01:01:29.672
I'm touched.

1619
01:01:29.672 --> 01:01:30.673
(I'm really touched.)

1620
01:01:31.274 --> 01:01:32.408
1, 2, 3.

1621
01:01:33.009 --> 01:01:35.378
(They succeeded after 7 tries.)

1622
01:01:35.678 --> 01:01:38.114
- This is fun. - We're inside now.

1623
01:01:38.114 --> 01:01:39.882
This is fun.

1624
01:01:42.785 --> 01:01:44.954
Was it really necessary?

1625
01:01:44.954 --> 01:01:46.089
(They can't teleport anymore.)

1626
01:01:46.089 --> 01:01:47.090
Are we going to keep doing it?

1627
01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:48.324
(They'll move by a car from now.)

1628
01:01:48.658 --> 01:01:50.893
It's getting a bit boring, right?

1629
01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.696
We'll give you a mission where you can win additional fees.

1630
01:01:53.696 --> 01:01:55.498
Additional fees? We don't have to pay to play, right?

1631
01:01:55.498 --> 01:01:57.900
- You'll compete with each other. - Okay.

1632
01:01:58.101 --> 01:02:00.603
We'll compete with each other? That'd be weird.

1633
01:02:01.104 --> 01:02:02.605
I'm ready for anything.

1634
01:02:03.006 --> 01:02:07.310
I'll give you a quiz on Indonesia.

1635
01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:10.146
- On Indonesia? - If you say the right answer,

1636
01:02:10.213 --> 01:02:11.781
you'll get five dollars.

1637
01:02:11.781 --> 01:02:12.815
- Five dollars? Okay. - Okay.

1638
01:02:13.149 --> 01:02:14.517
Here goes the question.

1639
01:02:14.951 --> 01:02:16.619
In Indonesia,

1640
01:02:17.153 --> 01:02:20.656
you should not touch a certain body part of a child.

1641
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:23.092
- Which part is it? - What about adults?

1642
01:02:23.693 --> 01:02:25.428
(Thinking)

1643
01:02:25.428 --> 01:02:26.963
Let me answer. Are there options?

1644
01:02:27.864 --> 01:02:28.865
No, there aren't.

1645
01:02:28.931 --> 01:02:30.600
- Let me answer. - I was faster.

1646
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.601
The head.

1647
01:02:31.601 --> 01:02:33.002
(Which part of a child's body should you not touch in Indonesia?)

1648
01:02:33.002 --> 01:02:35.538
- The head? - Yes, including hair.

1649
01:02:35.772 --> 01:02:37.206
- Correct. - Wait.

1650
01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:40.610
We'll give you the money later.

1651
01:02:41.344 --> 01:02:43.579
Indonesians consider the head sacred.

1652
01:02:43.579 --> 01:02:45.314
If you touch someone's head,

1653
01:02:45.314 --> 01:02:47.150
they think you're intruding into his or her soul's shelter.

1654
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:48.217
- You knew the answer? - Yes.

1655
01:02:48.217 --> 01:02:49.786
- You're lying. - I'm serious.

1656
01:02:49.786 --> 01:02:51.921
It's even worse to touch the head with your left hand, right?

1657
01:02:51.921 --> 01:02:53.489
No. Is that correct?

1658
01:02:53.623 --> 01:02:55.558
- Is it true? - If you touch the head...

1659
01:02:55.558 --> 01:02:58.661
with your left hand, it's unacceptable.

1660
01:02:58.928 --> 01:02:59.962
Exactly.

1661
01:03:00.463 --> 01:03:03.299
You should never touch children's heads, thinking they're adorable.

1662
01:03:03.299 --> 01:03:04.667
You really knew it.

1663
01:03:04.901 --> 01:03:08.371
Anyway, So Min won five dollars for question number 1.

1664
01:03:08.371 --> 01:03:09.372
Right.

1665
01:03:09.739 --> 01:03:11.140
Here goes the next question.

1666
01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.876
I'm getting serious. I'm serious.

1667
01:03:13.876 --> 01:03:14.911
(The second question)

1668
01:03:14.911 --> 01:03:17.013
In Indonesia,

1669
01:03:17.513 --> 01:03:20.416
how do girls greet...

1670
01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:22.118
each other?

1671
01:03:22.118 --> 01:03:23.119
Let me answer.

1672
01:03:23.519 --> 01:03:26.389
They pretend they kiss the other on the cheek.

1673
01:03:26.389 --> 01:03:28.524
Isn't that the French way?

1674
01:03:28.524 --> 01:03:32.128
(Isn't that the French way?)

1675
01:03:32.128 --> 01:03:33.396
You're such a know-it-all.

1676
01:03:35.465 --> 01:03:36.899
- Correct. - Yes!

1677
01:03:37.033 --> 01:03:38.101
What?

1678
01:03:39.135 --> 01:03:40.136
They kiss the other on the cheek.

1679
01:03:40.136 --> 01:03:41.404
(Kwang Soo wins five dollars.)

1680
01:03:42.939 --> 01:03:44.307
I think I've seen it.

1681
01:03:44.307 --> 01:03:45.308
- It gave me the chills. - How?

1682
01:03:45.308 --> 01:03:46.309
Like this?

1683
01:03:46.876 --> 01:03:50.279
(What are you doing?)

1684
01:03:50.279 --> 01:03:51.647
It's called cipika cipiki.

1685
01:03:51.647 --> 01:03:52.748
- Cipika? - Cipika?

1686
01:03:53.015 --> 01:03:54.317
- Cipika. - Cipika cipiki.

1687
01:03:54.317 --> 01:03:55.451
- Cipika cipiki. - Cipika cipiki.

1688
01:03:55.852 --> 01:03:57.320
What about between a guy and a girl?

1689
01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.321
(I'm suddenly curious.)

1690
01:03:58.321 --> 01:04:00.022
- They don't do it. - That's what...

1691
01:04:00.022 --> 01:04:01.557
they'll decide by themselves.

1692
01:04:02.258 --> 01:04:03.593
I'm just curious.

1693
01:04:04.393 --> 01:04:05.928
The next question is about a gesture.

1694
01:04:05.928 --> 01:04:07.497
I'll make a certain gesture.

1695
01:04:07.497 --> 01:04:11.367
Guess what it means in Indonesia.

1696
01:04:12.135 --> 01:04:13.202
Here we go.

1697
01:04:13.336 --> 01:04:15.938
(What does this gesture mean in Indonesia?)

1698
01:04:15.938 --> 01:04:16.973
Let me answer.

1699
01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.641
You're stopping your sweat...

1700
01:04:19.342 --> 01:04:20.877
from going into your eyes.

1701
01:04:20.877 --> 01:04:23.346
Stopping your sweat from going into your eyes?

1702
01:04:23.346 --> 01:04:25.148
- Wrong. - Why do you know so much?

1703
01:04:25.148 --> 01:04:26.382
It must have been close.

1704
01:04:26.816 --> 01:04:28.551
- It wasn't close at all. - No.

1705
01:04:28.751 --> 01:04:30.553
- He was just teasing me. - Did you make a deal?

1706
01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.121
(What does this gesture mean in Indonesia?)

1707
01:04:32.121 --> 01:04:33.856
"Stop it."

1708
01:04:33.856 --> 01:04:35.191
- Wrong. - Let me answer.

1709
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:36.492
(Wrong)

1710
01:04:36.492 --> 01:04:37.527
Go to the left.

1711
01:04:37.527 --> 01:04:39.228
(Go to the left.)

1712
01:04:39.262 --> 01:04:40.396
Wrong.

1713
01:04:40.396 --> 01:04:43.099
Let me answer. "Don't come here."

1714
01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.569
- Wrong. - "I'm drunk."

1715
01:04:47.336 --> 01:04:48.738
"You're stupid."

1716
01:04:48.838 --> 01:04:49.906
"You're stupid."

1717
01:04:49.906 --> 01:04:51.807
It doesn't have a good meaning.

1718
01:04:52.074 --> 01:04:53.075
Let me answer.

1719
01:04:53.509 --> 01:04:54.644
"Get lost."

1720
01:04:54.944 --> 01:04:56.279
- I was going to say that too. - Wrong.

1721
01:04:56.312 --> 01:04:57.480
I thought the same.

1722
01:04:57.947 --> 01:04:59.182
It doesn't have a good meaning?

1723
01:04:59.415 --> 01:05:01.317
In Korea, we do this.

1724
01:05:02.018 --> 01:05:03.152
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

1725
01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:05.988
No.

1726
01:05:05.988 --> 01:05:07.823
"You're nuts."

1727
01:05:07.857 --> 01:05:09.192
Please use proper words.

1728
01:05:09.192 --> 01:05:11.460
- Let me answer. "A crazy person". - "A crazy girl".

1729
01:05:11.561 --> 01:05:12.995
- "A crazy person". - "A crazy girl".

1730
01:05:12.995 --> 01:05:14.397
The correct answer is, "A crazy person".

1731
01:05:14.397 --> 01:05:17.934
(Kwang Soo wins 5 dollars.)

1732
01:05:17.934 --> 01:05:20.369
You have to say, "Let me answer" first.

1733
01:05:20.369 --> 01:05:21.370
The producer...

1734
01:05:21.771 --> 01:05:24.073
didn't say you could answer.

1735
01:05:24.073 --> 01:05:25.374
I was faster.

1736
01:05:25.441 --> 01:05:29.378
- Why did you let him cheat? - Cheat?

1737
01:05:29.745 --> 01:05:32.215
You took the money without permission too.

1738
01:05:32.215 --> 01:05:33.416
You didn't have the permission.

1739
01:05:33.416 --> 01:05:34.884
But I gave you my stuff.

1740
01:05:35.284 --> 01:05:37.086
Do you expect me to do everything your way?

1741
01:05:37.587 --> 01:05:39.121
How much do you expect me to give up?

1742
01:05:39.121 --> 01:05:40.389
Can't you be more generous?

1743
01:05:40.389 --> 01:05:42.558
(They're arguing like real siblings.)

1744
01:05:42.558 --> 01:05:43.659
You're going to Australia with me.

1745
01:05:43.659 --> 01:05:45.361
(You're going to the crocodile cage.)

1746
01:05:45.361 --> 01:05:47.930
(You're a crazy person.)

1747
01:05:48.097 --> 01:05:51.934
(They touch each other's head with their left hands.)

1748
01:05:51.934 --> 01:05:56.305
(They insult each other in the Indonesian way.)

1749
01:05:56.305 --> 01:05:58.841
You're both out of your mind.

1750
01:05:58.841 --> 01:06:01.143
- You two are crazy. - But you're cute together.

1751
01:06:02.011 --> 01:06:05.314
Here goes the second mission.

1752
01:06:05.314 --> 01:06:06.449
It's pretty simple.

1753
01:06:06.449 --> 01:06:08.117
It's Kwang Soo's favorite, roulette.

1754
01:06:08.517 --> 01:06:09.819
What's my favorite?

1755
01:06:09.952 --> 01:06:12.088
Both of you will spin two wheels.

1756
01:06:12.488 --> 01:06:13.956
The 1st wheel has numbers 1 to 8 on it.

1757
01:06:13.956 --> 01:06:15.891
The other one has plus and minus signs on it.

1758
01:06:16.659 --> 01:06:19.795
The numbers determine how much you will get.

1759
01:06:20.363 --> 01:06:24.000
If I get a minus sign, do I lose money?

1760
01:06:24.033 --> 01:06:25.768
- We'll take it away. - And...

1761
01:06:25.768 --> 01:06:28.404
you can even end up with a minus amount, right?

1762
01:06:29.105 --> 01:06:30.573
(So Min gives it a try.)

1763
01:06:30.573 --> 01:06:31.774
I should pick a good number.

1764
01:06:31.774 --> 01:06:32.808
The number is not important.

1765
01:06:33.042 --> 01:06:34.343
1, 2, 3.

1766
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:36.579
It doesn't make any sound.

1767
01:06:36.646 --> 01:06:38.414
- What's that? - On the way here,

1768
01:06:38.414 --> 01:06:40.216
- Is it broken? - it broke.

1769
01:06:40.616 --> 01:06:42.218
Aren't you supposed to throw a dart?

1770
01:06:42.218 --> 01:06:43.953
It won't stop spinning.

1771
01:06:43.953 --> 01:06:49.191
(Which number will So Min get?)

1772
01:06:49.191 --> 01:06:50.192
- It's a 6. - It's a 6.

1773
01:06:50.192 --> 01:06:51.193
- 60 dollars. - 60 dollars.

1774
01:06:51.193 --> 01:06:53.296
I hope I get a plus sign.

1775
01:06:53.296 --> 01:06:55.731
(As she got a big number, she has to get a plus sign.)

1776
01:06:55.731 --> 01:06:57.500
(If she gets a plus sign, she'll have more money than Kwang Soo.)

1777
01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.302
That's the sound it should make.

1778
01:06:59.302 --> 01:07:01.070
(If she gets a plus sign, she'll have more money than Kwang Soo.)

1779
01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:07.410
(Will So Min get plus 6 or minus 6?)

1780
01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:09.345
- It's a plus sign. - Oh, my.

1781
01:07:09.345 --> 01:07:10.413
(Plus 6)

1782
01:07:10.413 --> 01:07:12.715
I'm getting 60 dollars.

1783
01:07:12.715 --> 01:07:15.718
Did you see? Please capture this. I'm getting 60 dollars.

1784
01:07:15.718 --> 01:07:16.819
You're getting 60 dollars.

1785
01:07:16.819 --> 01:07:17.953
I knew it.

1786
01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.022
- I'm so lucky. - So Min...

1787
01:07:20.022 --> 01:07:22.391
has won 100 dollars in this car.

1788
01:07:22.591 --> 01:07:23.693
I won 100 dollars.

1789
01:07:23.693 --> 01:07:24.694
(So Min won 100 dollars in the car alone.)

1790
01:07:24.694 --> 01:07:26.062
It's Kwang Soo's turn now.

1791
01:07:26.395 --> 01:07:28.464
Let me hold it for you.

1792
01:07:29.465 --> 01:07:31.033
I'm already ahead of her.

1793
01:07:31.033 --> 01:07:33.035
Kwang Soo is ahead of So Min.

1794
01:07:33.035 --> 01:07:36.972
(The roulette can turn the situation around.)

1795
01:07:36.972 --> 01:07:41.110
(Will Kwang Soo be able to maintain the first place?)

1796
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:42.111
I'm getting dizzy.

1797
01:07:44.046 --> 01:07:45.147
(The result is out.)

1798
01:07:45.147 --> 01:07:46.148
It's an eight.

1799
01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:48.050
- It's a 1. - It's a 1?

1800
01:07:48.617 --> 01:07:49.885
It's 10 dollars.

1801
01:07:50.586 --> 01:07:51.587
It's a one.

1802
01:07:51.587 --> 01:07:53.656
(Kwang Soo got the smallest number.)

1803
01:07:53.656 --> 01:07:55.725
Will it be a plus sign or a minus sign?

1804
01:07:56.258 --> 01:07:59.028
It won't make a big difference. Take it easy.

1805
01:08:00.363 --> 01:08:01.364
Start.

1806
01:08:01.697 --> 01:08:02.732
Is this even worth anything?

1807
01:08:02.732 --> 01:08:04.700
(Does it matter if he gets plus or minus?)

1808
01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:07.570
- You never know. - I'm neither happy nor sad.

1809
01:08:08.437 --> 01:08:09.538
I'll spin it.

1810
01:08:09.538 --> 01:08:10.906
(It's still better to get a plus.)

1811
01:08:10.906 --> 01:08:16.879
(Would he win or lose 10 dollars?)

1812
01:08:19.315 --> 01:08:21.317
(It's a minus.)

1813
01:08:21.317 --> 01:08:22.451
It's a minus.

1814
01:08:23.486 --> 01:08:24.720
He got a minus.

1815
01:08:27.156 --> 01:08:28.190
I turned it around.

1816
01:08:28.357 --> 01:08:29.458
I turned it around completely.

1817
01:08:30.259 --> 01:08:31.794
- Kwang Soo is so bad. - He got minus 8.

1818
01:08:31.794 --> 01:08:33.829
All the roulettes...

1819
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:36.298
What if you spin it again,

1820
01:08:36.932 --> 01:08:38.801
and if you get a plus, you can take 20 dollars.

1821
01:08:38.801 --> 01:08:40.903
If you get a minus, you lose 20 dollars.

1822
01:08:41.737 --> 01:08:43.506
- Just plus or minus? Not this? - No.

1823
01:08:43.506 --> 01:08:45.074
What if you spin the plus or minus,

1824
01:08:45.274 --> 01:08:47.943
and if you get a minus, you lose the 15 dollars you won.

1825
01:08:48.043 --> 01:08:50.079
- You'll lose everything. - You'll get zero dollars.

1826
01:08:50.079 --> 01:08:51.914
- But if you win... - You'll get 20 dollars.

1827
01:08:51.914 --> 01:08:53.249
If you get a plus, you get 20 dollars.

1828
01:08:53.249 --> 01:08:54.250
Okay.

1829
01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:56.218
(He can win 20 dollars if he gets a plus.)

1830
01:08:56.519 --> 01:08:57.686
Good luck.

1831
01:08:58.587 --> 01:09:00.055
I hope you're happy.

1832
01:09:00.055 --> 01:09:02.658
(He spins it as best as he can.)

1833
01:09:02.658 --> 01:09:03.893
Please.

1834
01:09:05.027 --> 01:09:08.230
(If it's a plus, he gets 20 dollars. If it's a minus, he gets 0.)

1835
01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:10.366
- Okay. - What will it be?

1836
01:09:10.366 --> 01:09:12.601
This is the question.

1837
01:09:13.135 --> 01:09:15.404
- It's a minus. - I remember now.

1838
01:09:15.404 --> 01:09:16.906
- I don't remember. - He is...

1839
01:09:16.906 --> 01:09:18.607
- really unlucky. - He is, right?

1840
01:09:18.607 --> 01:09:21.110
Please come forward, and take the truth or false cards.

1841
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:23.679
- You didn't know the question. - You remember, right?

1842
01:09:23.913 --> 01:09:25.047
Yes, I remember.

1843
01:09:25.047 --> 01:09:26.982
(Who will tell the truth, and who will lie?)

1844
01:09:26.982 --> 01:09:28.350
Gosh.

1845
01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:30.219
I can't trust them.

1846
01:09:30.686 --> 01:09:32.555
I'm going to look at their eyes.

1847
01:09:32.688 --> 01:09:35.724
I'll tell you exactly what happened.

1848
01:09:35.891 --> 01:09:37.927
Kwang Soo is usually unlucky,

1849
01:09:37.993 --> 01:09:40.196
but sometimes, he gets lucky in the beginning.

1850
01:09:40.196 --> 01:09:43.032
- Right, right. - He got a plus and won the money.

1851
01:09:43.032 --> 01:09:46.135
(So Min claims that Kwang Soo got a plus and won the money.)

1852
01:09:46.135 --> 01:09:47.303
That's right.

1853
01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:48.704
- Let me tell you this. - Kwang Soo did.

1854
01:09:48.704 --> 01:09:51.340
- So Min is convincing. - She's calm.

1855
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.344
I had much more money than her.

1856
01:09:55.344 --> 01:09:57.012
I started with 100 dollars, and she had 50.

1857
01:09:57.012 --> 01:09:58.147
In the end...

1858
01:09:58.214 --> 01:09:59.381
I can say the result, right?

1859
01:09:59.682 --> 01:10:00.749
It doesn't matter.

1860
01:10:00.749 --> 01:10:01.917
In the end, I lost.

1861
01:10:01.917 --> 01:10:03.319
(In the end, I lost.)

1862
01:10:03.686 --> 01:10:04.854
She overtook me.

1863
01:10:04.854 --> 01:10:07.690
(Kwang Soo claims he got a minus, and So Min overtook him.)

1864
01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:09.158
That wasn't the only game.

1865
01:10:09.158 --> 01:10:10.559
- There were games after this. - There were, right?

1866
01:10:10.559 --> 01:10:12.862
-That's right, So Min. - There weren't games like this.

1867
01:10:12.862 --> 01:10:16.198
I don't have much to say about this.

1868
01:10:16.198 --> 01:10:18.400
It's either a plus or minus.

1869
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.302
Excuse me, but are you listening to the radio?

1870
01:10:20.302 --> 01:10:25.307
(Excuse me, but are you listening to the radio?)

1871
01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:27.109
What are you doing?

1872
01:10:27.109 --> 01:10:28.844
Can you lower the volume?

1873
01:10:28.844 --> 01:10:30.279
What are you doing?

1874
01:10:30.279 --> 01:10:32.548
- I don't really know him. - I thought this was free time.

1875
01:10:32.548 --> 01:10:34.149
I'm still debating.

1876
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:36.151
- You're listening. - Right.

1877
01:10:36.285 --> 01:10:39.088
I lost most of my money here.

1878
01:10:39.088 --> 01:10:40.089
You punk.

1879
01:10:40.089 --> 01:10:42.124
(You punk)

1880
01:10:42.124 --> 01:10:43.626
Stop lying. Tell the truth.

1881
01:10:43.626 --> 01:10:46.662
(What punk?)

1882
01:10:46.662 --> 01:10:47.863
(Stop lying. Tell the truth.)

1883
01:10:47.863 --> 01:10:49.532
I was watching you.

1884
01:10:49.732 --> 01:10:51.100
Who are you, mister?

1885
01:10:51.867 --> 01:10:53.235
Who are you?

1886
01:10:53.235 --> 01:10:56.005
Punk, I was watching you. Stop lying.

1887
01:10:56.005 --> 01:10:57.640
- You punk. - You punk.

1888
01:10:57.706 --> 01:10:59.375
Kwang Soo.

1889
01:10:59.375 --> 01:11:00.543
You're telling the truth.

1890
01:11:00.543 --> 01:11:03.579
(Kwang Soo, you're telling the truth.)

1891
01:11:03.579 --> 01:11:05.247
Thank you. I'm serious.

1892
01:11:05.581 --> 01:11:06.749
Again?

1893
01:11:06.749 --> 01:11:08.684
(Nobody believes him, but Jong Kook does.)

1894
01:11:08.684 --> 01:11:10.920
You're indeed Justice Kook.

1895
01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:14.356
If you're lying, you're in trouble.

1896
01:11:14.356 --> 01:11:15.658
- Please give us some advice. - What's this about?

1897
01:11:15.925 --> 01:11:19.194
So Min suggested this game.

1898
01:11:19.295 --> 01:11:21.931
He lost, so he asked So Min to play another round.

1899
01:11:22.064 --> 01:11:23.799
That's why there were other games after this.

1900
01:11:23.799 --> 01:11:25.134
- No. - Mister.

1901
01:11:25.134 --> 01:11:27.336
I've been watching you.

1902
01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:29.371
- If you think... - Excuse me.

1903
01:11:29.371 --> 01:11:30.673
Keep watching me then.

1904
01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.409
- Don't say anything. Just watch. - All right.

1905
01:11:33.542 --> 01:11:34.643
Sure.

1906
01:11:34.643 --> 01:11:37.179
- You're right. - You were watching me.

1907
01:11:37.179 --> 01:11:39.882
- Why would you speak now? - That's true.

1908
01:11:39.949 --> 01:11:41.250
I'm telling you everything.

1909
01:11:41.283 --> 01:11:43.719
- Whatever situation... - Kwang Soo.

1910
01:11:43.719 --> 01:11:44.753
I'm being honest.

1911
01:11:44.753 --> 01:11:46.221
- He doesn't look confident. - He's sweating.

1912
01:11:46.221 --> 01:11:47.456
No, it's oil.

1913
01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:50.492
Listen to me. I'm serious.

1914
01:11:50.492 --> 01:11:51.660
I started going downhill...

1915
01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.928
Stop it, you punk.

1916
01:11:53.162 --> 01:11:54.663
You punk.

1917
01:11:54.663 --> 01:11:59.168
(Kwang Soo explodes.)

1918
01:11:59.168 --> 01:12:00.369
I let you go a few times.

1919
01:12:01.003 --> 01:12:02.538
- Fine. - Do you want to be handcuffed?

1920
01:12:02.538 --> 01:12:04.039
I think you are right.

1921
01:12:04.039 --> 01:12:05.608
- I am. - Give me a vote.

1922
01:12:05.608 --> 01:12:07.810
Please give me a vote. I'm certain.

1923
01:12:07.943 --> 01:12:09.111
All right.

1924
01:12:09.111 --> 01:12:11.580
We won't be using these cards for this round.

1925
01:12:12.014 --> 01:12:13.882
We'll decide using the Car of Truth.

1926
01:12:13.882 --> 01:12:16.986
(They'll decide using the Car of Truth.)

1927
01:12:16.986 --> 01:12:18.220
- Car of Truth? - In the parking lot,

1928
01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.557
there are two buses with Kwang Soo and So Min's names on them.

1929
01:12:21.657 --> 01:12:24.960
Please get on the bus of the person you think is telling the truth.

1930
01:12:25.194 --> 01:12:26.261
However,

1931
01:12:26.362 --> 01:12:30.933
the penalty for this round is a very scary ride.

1932
01:12:30.933 --> 01:12:35.804
(If you make the wrong choice, you get a scary penalty.)

1933
01:12:36.372 --> 01:12:39.742
(The staff members already tried it out.)

1934
01:12:39.742 --> 01:12:42.344
(They couldn't recover from it.)

1935
01:12:42.344 --> 01:12:43.679
Let's end this here.

1936
01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:45.414
Oh, my goodness. I don't like rides.

1937
01:12:45.414 --> 01:12:46.982
This is so difficult.

1938
01:12:46.982 --> 01:12:48.317
Please make up your minds.

1939
01:12:48.951 --> 01:12:52.688
Let's move to the Car of Truth.

1940
01:12:52.688 --> 01:12:53.756
(If you want to avoid the penalty, you must get on the Car of Truth.)

1941
01:12:54.657 --> 01:12:56.859
(It's time to choose.)

1942
01:12:56.859 --> 01:12:58.293
Come here, everybody.

1943
01:12:59.662 --> 01:13:00.929
Please come.

1944
01:13:01.263 --> 01:13:02.798
- Jeon So Min. - I'm serious.

1945
01:13:02.798 --> 01:13:05.501
- Jeon So Min. - I think you know.

1946
01:13:05.601 --> 01:13:07.536
- I'm truthful. - Truth gets told,

1947
01:13:07.536 --> 01:13:09.171
and justice wins.

1948
01:13:09.638 --> 01:13:11.540
I think So Min is lying.

1949
01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.676
That's what I thought from the beginning.

1950
01:13:13.676 --> 01:13:14.910
I lost in the end.

1951
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:17.846
I was ahead of her by 50 dollars, but I lost.

1952
01:13:17.846 --> 01:13:19.815
Remember the first time.

1953
01:13:19.948 --> 01:13:22.685
Kwang Soo is really good at lying now.

1954
01:13:22.685 --> 01:13:23.752
I'm serious.

1955
01:13:24.019 --> 01:13:25.921
- You punk. - There he goes again.

1956
01:13:26.021 --> 01:13:27.589
What?

1957
01:13:27.589 --> 01:13:30.192
If you're lying, I won't leave you alone.

1958
01:13:30.192 --> 01:13:31.960
Is he a mental patient?

1959
01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.462
- What is wrong with you? - I won't leave you alone.

1960
01:13:33.462 --> 01:13:35.097
Jae Seok, trust me this time. I'm telling the truth.

1961
01:13:35.497 --> 01:13:37.399
I think it's So Min.

1962
01:13:37.399 --> 01:13:38.400
(Ji Hyo uses her instincts.)

1963
01:13:38.867 --> 01:13:40.135
- Okay. - Really.

1964
01:13:40.135 --> 01:13:41.670
I'm serious, Haha.

1965
01:13:42.137 --> 01:13:43.205
Okay.

1966
01:13:43.205 --> 01:13:46.341
You have to go on the ride.

1967
01:13:46.642 --> 01:13:47.676
I'm serious.

1968
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:48.944
Se Chan.

1969
01:13:48.944 --> 01:13:50.379
Please trust me this time.

1970
01:13:50.379 --> 01:13:51.747
Haha, let's go.

1971
01:13:51.747 --> 01:13:53.449
Haha.

1972
01:13:54.683 --> 01:13:56.752
- Go away, you liar. - It's over.

1973
01:13:56.752 --> 01:13:57.886
Once you get on, it's over.

1974
01:13:58.053 --> 01:13:59.588
It'll most likely be you.

1975
01:14:00.322 --> 01:14:02.424
- Hold on. - He usually doesn't talk a lot.

1976
01:14:02.424 --> 01:14:04.226
He doesn't talk a lot.

1977
01:14:04.226 --> 01:14:06.095
When he's lying...

1978
01:14:06.095 --> 01:14:07.362
I know we're going on the Nevis Swing together,

1979
01:14:07.362 --> 01:14:10.499
but don't try to control me.

1980
01:14:10.499 --> 01:14:11.934
Follow me, Haha.

1981
01:14:12.167 --> 01:14:14.670
You're a coward.

1982
01:14:14.670 --> 01:14:15.771
- Hold on. - Follow me.

1983
01:14:15.771 --> 01:14:18.040
- You're going to get on, right? - Where are you going to go?

1984
01:14:18.107 --> 01:14:20.342
- I don't know yet. - Don't regret it. He's wrong.

1985
01:14:21.143 --> 01:14:22.311
I'm honest.

1986
01:14:23.011 --> 01:14:24.079
Let's see how this looks.

1987
01:14:24.079 --> 01:14:25.447
(He peeks into So Min's bus.)

1988
01:14:25.714 --> 01:14:26.915
I'm here,

1989
01:14:26.949 --> 01:14:28.751
- your younger brother. - All right.

1990
01:14:28.751 --> 01:14:29.952
- Se Chan. - Yes, brother.

1991
01:14:29.952 --> 01:14:32.921
Think about how terrible you felt when you lost to Kwang Soo.

1992
01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:34.356
- Right. - Think about it.

1993
01:14:34.523 --> 01:14:36.458
Even if we get lied to,

1994
01:14:36.458 --> 01:14:38.827
- it's better to let So Min fool us. - I agree.

1995
01:14:42.331 --> 01:14:43.465
I'll get on this bus.

1996
01:14:45.834 --> 01:14:47.836
Do I have no credibility?

1997
01:14:47.836 --> 01:14:49.438
No, this is better.

1998
01:14:49.438 --> 01:14:50.973
This is so unfair.

1999
01:14:50.973 --> 01:14:52.674
Am I not credible?

2000
01:14:52.674 --> 01:14:54.243
I can't believe Haha went there.

2001
01:14:54.243 --> 01:14:55.444
Are you still debating, Ji Hyo?

2002
01:14:56.779 --> 01:14:58.113
No, I think it's Kwang Soo.

2003
01:14:58.113 --> 01:15:01.416
If Ji Hyo gets this right,

2004
01:15:01.683 --> 01:15:04.653
I feel sorry for your previous boyfriends.

2005
01:15:04.653 --> 01:15:06.455
(You can never lie to her.)

2006
01:15:06.455 --> 01:15:07.890
They can't lie to you at all.

2007
01:15:08.724 --> 01:15:11.794
- She knows everything. - She's good at this.

2008
01:15:12.194 --> 01:15:13.662
- Somebody's coming. - Seok Jin.

2009
01:15:14.029 --> 01:15:15.397
(She touts them with prizes.)

2010
01:15:15.397 --> 01:15:16.832
- Okay. - Look at this.

2011
01:15:17.733 --> 01:15:19.601
- Seok Jin. - I have low energy.

2012
01:15:19.601 --> 01:15:21.970
Enjoy the ride.

2013
01:15:22.171 --> 01:15:24.273
- Enjoy the ride. - I'll drink it up.

2014
01:15:24.273 --> 01:15:25.707
- Ji Hyo. - Watch her.

2015
01:15:26.475 --> 01:15:27.776
I wish you luck.

2016
01:15:28.377 --> 01:15:30.546
I wish you luck.

2017
01:15:31.013 --> 01:15:33.415
I'm so tired these days because I'm babysitting.

2018
01:15:33.482 --> 01:15:34.817
- Have one. - It's ginseng.

2019
01:15:34.817 --> 01:15:36.718
(They love the free gifts.)

2020
01:15:36.718 --> 01:15:38.821
(Gulping)

2021
01:15:39.621 --> 01:15:41.256
- This is sweet. - It's good.

2022
01:15:41.256 --> 01:15:42.991
- It's the pure extract. - It's good.

2023
01:15:43.792 --> 01:15:45.894
I like this.

2024
01:15:47.362 --> 01:15:49.198
Thank you. Oh, really?

2025
01:15:49.565 --> 01:15:52.534
- The bus can't leave. Come. - Me?

2026
01:15:52.668 --> 01:15:54.503
It's time to go. Why aren't you coming?

2027
01:15:54.503 --> 01:15:55.671
What do you mean?

2028
01:15:55.671 --> 01:15:58.307
- That wasn't the plan. - He told me something.

2029
01:15:58.307 --> 01:16:00.042
I'm certain.

2030
01:16:00.042 --> 01:16:01.844
- Why are you trying to take me? - Don't go.

2031
01:16:01.844 --> 01:16:03.812
- Seok Jin, why do you think so? - We took a vote,

2032
01:16:03.812 --> 01:16:06.782
and you're the most gullible one from here.

2033
01:16:06.782 --> 01:16:07.983
(He's so gullible.)

2034
01:16:07.983 --> 01:16:09.184
- Seok Jin. - Why do you think so?

2035
01:16:09.184 --> 01:16:10.953
Seok Jin, that bus is cooler.

2036
01:16:10.953 --> 01:16:12.321
(It's at least cooler.)

2037
01:16:12.321 --> 01:16:15.357
(He gets up without a second thought.)

2038
01:16:15.357 --> 01:16:17.426
Let go.

2039
01:16:17.426 --> 01:16:19.161
- It's so hot here. - Focus.

2040
01:16:19.161 --> 01:16:22.064
- It's so hot here. - Focus. Focus!

2041
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:24.333
- Seok Jin. - He doesn't care.

2042
01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:25.834
You'll be punished for sure.

2043
01:16:26.168 --> 01:16:27.703
You'll be punished.

2044
01:16:28.103 --> 01:16:29.171
Okay.

2045
01:16:29.605 --> 01:16:32.140
(I don't like the heat.)

2046
01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:33.642
- Who is it? - It's Seok Jin.

2047
01:16:33.642 --> 01:16:35.878
- Seok Jin. - All right.

2048
01:16:35.878 --> 01:16:38.480
- Isn't it cooler here? - It's So Min.

2049
01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.782
- Okay. - It's a lot cooler here, right?

2050
01:16:40.816 --> 01:16:42.985
- Good job. - Why aren't they coming here?

2051
01:16:42.985 --> 01:16:44.887
- Good job. - Let's go.

2052
01:16:45.454 --> 01:16:47.422
(How will Kwang Soo and So Min defend themselves?)

2053
01:16:47.422 --> 01:16:49.558
As long as more people don't come here...

2054
01:16:49.558 --> 01:16:51.493
Aren't you certain though?

2055
01:16:51.827 --> 01:16:53.495
- I'm not. - I'm not.

2056
01:16:53.495 --> 01:16:57.266
- Look at this situation. - This is the strange thing, Ji Hyo.

2057
01:16:57.332 --> 01:17:01.670
Let's do the opposite of Jae Seok.

2058
01:17:01.837 --> 01:17:03.805
- For sure. - Let's do that.

2059
01:17:03.805 --> 01:17:06.742
You have to ride the Navy Swing anyway. Do you want this too?

2060
01:17:06.742 --> 01:17:10.012
(You have to ride the Navy Swing anyway.)

2061
01:17:10.012 --> 01:17:11.179
Isn't it the Nevis Swing?

2062
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.315
Is it? Nevis Swing.

2063
01:17:13.315 --> 01:17:15.684
(It's the same thing.)

2064
01:17:17.185 --> 01:17:18.353
I'm telling the truth.

2065
01:17:18.353 --> 01:17:19.955
(If Kwang Soo's claim is a lie, they both get punished.)

2066
01:17:19.955 --> 01:17:21.390
This is the truth.

2067
01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:23.425
I think So Min...

2068
01:17:23.425 --> 01:17:26.061
She didn't act like it was unfair.

2069
01:17:26.061 --> 01:17:28.363
She looked like she was pulling our legs.

2070
01:17:28.363 --> 01:17:30.632
- I think... - That's why.

2071
01:17:30.632 --> 01:17:35.170
I see her motive in wanting to take the members.

2072
01:17:36.672 --> 01:17:42.077
(Is So Min's plea a lie?)

2073
01:17:42.077 --> 01:17:44.112
We have a lie detector ready if you need it.

2074
01:17:44.112 --> 01:17:46.048
The one you put your hand on?

2075
01:17:46.081 --> 01:17:47.683
I can do it.

2076
01:17:47.916 --> 01:17:49.151
- Should we try it? - I can do it.

2077
01:17:49.151 --> 01:17:50.619
(They bring in a special equipment.)

2078
01:17:50.619 --> 01:17:51.753
Put your hand on this.

2079
01:17:51.753 --> 01:17:53.388
(It's a lie detector.)

2080
01:17:53.388 --> 01:17:54.957
- All right. - Your hands are sweaty.

2081
01:17:54.957 --> 01:17:56.191
- So Min. - Yes.

2082
01:17:56.391 --> 01:18:00.062
- Is this a lie or not? - It's not.

2083
01:18:00.662 --> 01:18:01.730
It's the truth.

2084
01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:03.131
- Are you certain? - I am.

2085
01:18:03.131 --> 01:18:04.433
(She says she's not lying.)

2086
01:18:05.434 --> 01:18:07.669
(What will their special equipment make out?)

2087
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:08.837
I am.

2088
01:18:09.404 --> 01:18:10.505
(Zapping)

2089
01:18:10.505 --> 01:18:15.177
That stings.

2090
01:18:15.978 --> 01:18:17.346
No.

2091
01:18:17.846 --> 01:18:19.581
Can we change our minds?

2092
01:18:19.915 --> 01:18:21.183
- Gosh. - Hold on.

2093
01:18:21.183 --> 01:18:23.318
This made me lose trust in you.

2094
01:18:23.685 --> 01:18:24.987
I'm telling the truth.

2095
01:18:24.987 --> 01:18:26.688
Wait. This is saying she's lying.

2096
01:18:26.688 --> 01:18:28.523
They're both actors,

2097
01:18:28.523 --> 01:18:30.659
so they're great at acting. They'll always trick us.

2098
01:18:30.659 --> 01:18:34.596
I can't act without a script.

2099
01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:37.299
- What do you mean? - I can't do it on the spot.

2100
01:18:37.299 --> 01:18:39.301
- Put your hand on this. - Ad-libbing?

2101
01:18:39.301 --> 01:18:40.569
Try it again.

2102
01:18:41.503 --> 01:18:43.605
I can't act without a script.

2103
01:18:43.605 --> 01:18:45.374
This is not acting. This is for real.

2104
01:18:45.374 --> 01:18:46.475
- Are you sure? - This is the truth.

2105
01:18:46.475 --> 01:18:48.410
Should we trust her?

2106
01:18:48.844 --> 01:18:50.112
I'm getting anxious.

2107
01:18:51.013 --> 01:18:52.848
I'm telling the truth.

2108
01:18:52.848 --> 01:18:54.483
- Are you certain? - I am.

2109
01:18:54.483 --> 01:18:59.621
(Will it be true this time?)

2110
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:03.992
(It's the truth.)

2111
01:19:03.992 --> 01:19:06.128
It's fine. Please take this away.

2112
01:19:06.128 --> 01:19:07.696
We'll trust So Min.

2113
01:19:07.696 --> 01:19:09.798
Hold on. Why was she...

2114
01:19:09.931 --> 01:19:12.567
- so surprised? - I know, right?

2115
01:19:13.568 --> 01:19:16.304
(Was she surprised...)

2116
01:19:16.304 --> 01:19:18.573
(that it was deemed to be true?)

2117
01:19:18.573 --> 01:19:20.409
Why was she shocked by the result?

2118
01:19:20.609 --> 01:19:22.411
No, I thought it was going to be a lie.

2119
01:19:22.411 --> 01:19:24.880
- You never know. - If she was telling the truth,

2120
01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.150
she would have been like, "Right?"

2121
01:19:28.150 --> 01:19:30.719
But she was surprised. That's strange.

2122
01:19:30.719 --> 01:19:32.854
Listen to the way she said it.

2123
01:19:32.954 --> 01:19:36.525
If she was lying,

2124
01:19:36.691 --> 01:19:38.760
she would have breathed in while saying that.

2125
01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.863
But she breathed out.

2126
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:44.099
There's such thing.

2127
01:19:44.099 --> 01:19:46.501
I think she's telling the truth.

2128
01:19:47.235 --> 01:19:48.437
Wait.

2129
01:19:48.437 --> 01:19:50.138
- He's just... - There's such thing?

2130
01:19:50.138 --> 01:19:51.540
- guessing today. - There is.

2131
01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.308
If somebody else said that, you would have disagreed.

2132
01:19:53.308 --> 01:19:55.010
- Her exclamation... - Am I not right?

2133
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:56.878
She was surprised that this was right.

2134
01:19:56.878 --> 01:19:59.581
- That's what she meant. - Are you sure?

2135
01:19:59.581 --> 01:20:00.849
Of course, I am.

2136
01:20:00.849 --> 01:20:03.351
We're not doubting her anymore after what Jong Kook said.

2137
01:20:04.319 --> 01:20:06.054
He's so convincing.

2138
01:20:06.054 --> 01:20:08.256
- Do you want to try it? - No, I'm scared of it.

2139
01:20:08.256 --> 01:20:09.291
- Why? - It scares me.

2140
01:20:09.291 --> 01:20:10.425
Try it.

2141
01:20:10.425 --> 01:20:11.760
- Try it. - Put your hand on it.

2142
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.828
(Seok Jin becomes a subject to verify the special equipment.)

2143
01:20:12.828 --> 01:20:14.629
- Why are you ramping it up? - I'm not.

2144
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:16.331
(Seok Jin becomes a subject to verify the special equipment.)

2145
01:20:16.331 --> 01:20:18.266
Ask me a question. I'm getting sweaty.

2146
01:20:18.266 --> 01:20:19.468
Wait. Do you have...

2147
01:20:20.635 --> 01:20:21.770
a question for him?

2148
01:20:22.003 --> 01:20:24.940
That burns.

2149
01:20:25.941 --> 01:20:27.175
He's full of lies.

2150
01:20:27.375 --> 01:20:29.044
He's full of lies.

2151
01:20:29.044 --> 01:20:31.513
- That burns. - I didn't even ask a question.

2152
01:20:31.513 --> 01:20:33.982
He's a liar.

2153
01:20:33.982 --> 01:20:36.351
He's a liar himself.

2154
01:20:36.351 --> 01:20:38.520
The lie detector is confusing us.

2155
01:20:38.653 --> 01:20:40.655
This is confusing us more.

2156
01:20:40.655 --> 01:20:42.691
Can we try this on Kwang Soo?

2157
01:20:42.958 --> 01:20:44.659
They're probably doing it.

2158
01:20:44.659 --> 01:20:46.194
They probably are.

2159
01:20:47.529 --> 01:20:50.432
I'll answer truthfully to your questions.

2160
01:20:50.432 --> 01:20:52.100
"I'm lying right now."

2161
01:20:52.167 --> 01:20:53.168
No.

2162
01:20:53.168 --> 01:20:56.671
(He says no.)

2163
01:20:56.671 --> 01:20:57.706
I'm confident.

2164
01:20:57.706 --> 01:21:00.642
(What does the lie detector think?)

2165
01:21:00.642 --> 01:21:03.378
I got a minus. Look.

2166
01:21:03.378 --> 01:21:05.313
(It thinks he's telling the truth.)

2167
01:21:05.313 --> 01:21:07.382
"I'm lying right now."

2168
01:21:07.682 --> 01:21:08.750
I'm confident.

2169
01:21:09.217 --> 01:21:10.285
No.

2170
01:21:10.552 --> 01:21:11.920
I'm telling the truth.

2171
01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.488
(He gets asked the same question.)

2172
01:21:13.722 --> 01:21:14.923
(Zapping)

2173
01:21:14.923 --> 01:21:18.860
(It's a lie.)

2174
01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:22.164
(Were you lying, Kwang Soo?)

2175
01:21:22.164 --> 01:21:24.499
You punk, you can lie to us one time...

2176
01:21:24.833 --> 01:21:27.435
- but not twice. - You can't lie to us twice.

2177
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:32.674
The culprit always returns to the scene of the crime.

2178
01:21:32.674 --> 01:21:33.742
I'm telling the truth.

2179
01:21:34.309 --> 01:21:36.144
Please give me another chance.

2180
01:21:37.379 --> 01:21:40.949
"When I went to Indonesia,"

2181
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:44.219
"I went into So Min's room."

2182
01:21:44.886 --> 01:21:46.788
I didn't.

2183
01:21:46.788 --> 01:21:53.128
(He says no.)

2184
01:21:53.128 --> 01:21:54.796
I don't know why I should be doing this.

2185
01:21:54.796 --> 01:21:57.332
"I went into So Min's room." Yes or no.

2186
01:21:57.632 --> 01:21:59.534
- No. - No? Are you sure?

2187
01:21:59.534 --> 01:22:02.003
Why should I be doing this?

2188
01:22:02.003 --> 01:22:03.438
(He says no again.)

2189
01:22:03.438 --> 01:22:05.273
This is how truthful...

2190
01:22:05.941 --> 01:22:07.042
(It's true again.)

2191
01:22:07.042 --> 01:22:08.176
Then,

2192
01:22:08.710 --> 01:22:12.981
"So Min came into my room." Yes or no.

2193
01:22:13.448 --> 01:22:14.549
No.

2194
01:22:14.549 --> 01:22:19.688
(He says she didn't come into his room.)

2195
01:22:19.688 --> 01:22:22.524
(Zapping)

2196
01:22:22.724 --> 01:22:25.026
(It's a downright lie.)

2197
01:22:25.026 --> 01:22:26.361
I was thinking.

2198
01:22:26.695 --> 01:22:28.330
She came when we were filming.

2199
01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:31.032
- She came. I'm right. - My gosh.

2200
01:22:31.199 --> 01:22:33.034
I know this sounds weird,

2201
01:22:33.268 --> 01:22:34.669
but she came to film.

2202
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:37.172
I'm being honest. This is a malfunction.

2203
01:22:38.039 --> 01:22:39.140
Please give it back.

2204
01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:40.742
You can't just take it back.

2205
01:22:40.942 --> 01:22:42.911
What does that make me?

2206
01:22:42.911 --> 01:22:45.513
(It leaves many questions behind.)

2207
01:22:45.513 --> 01:22:46.748
Can you give me that?

2208
01:22:47.048 --> 01:22:49.384
- Let's see how you usually are. - Is this what they used?

2209
01:22:49.384 --> 01:22:50.685
Spin it three times.

2210
01:22:50.986 --> 01:22:52.153
I don't know.

2211
01:22:52.821 --> 01:22:54.623
Spin it like how you did before.

2212
01:22:54.623 --> 01:22:55.690
This is how it felt like.

2213
01:22:55.690 --> 01:22:56.758
(It's the same roulette Kwang Soo said he got a minus on.)

2214
01:22:59.027 --> 01:23:01.263
See? You get lucky sometimes too.

2215
01:23:01.263 --> 01:23:02.430
Try it again.

2216
01:23:02.864 --> 01:23:04.432
If you get a plus, you are done.

2217
01:23:06.134 --> 01:23:08.370
See? It works.

2218
01:23:08.403 --> 01:23:10.939
- He can get a plus. - What's going on?

2219
01:23:12.841 --> 01:23:16.711
(The third spin)

2220
01:23:16.711 --> 01:23:19.314
See? He got a plus all three times.

2221
01:23:19.314 --> 01:23:22.884
This is so interesting.

2222
01:23:22.884 --> 01:23:25.887
A lie detector? A roulette?

2223
01:23:25.887 --> 01:23:27.422
- That's how it seems. - He doesn't have to...

2224
01:23:27.422 --> 01:23:29.224
get minuses all the time.

2225
01:23:29.224 --> 01:23:31.192
He got pluses all three times.

2226
01:23:31.192 --> 01:23:32.427
It always goes the opposite.

2227
01:23:32.427 --> 01:23:34.829
That's the strange thing. It gives me goosebumps,

2228
01:23:34.829 --> 01:23:36.264
but I got a minus last time.

2229
01:23:36.965 --> 01:23:39.367
Please prove yourself. Spin it for the last time.

2230
01:23:39.634 --> 01:23:41.236
Today's a weird day for me.

2231
01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:46.708
(If you're telling the truth, prove yourself.)

2232
01:23:48.143 --> 01:23:51.780
(The last spin...)

2233
01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:53.915
(is a plus again.)

2234
01:23:53.915 --> 01:23:55.050
See?

2235
01:23:56.184 --> 01:23:59.287
- Who am I supposed to trust? - Fine.

2236
01:23:59.287 --> 01:24:00.455
This might seem weird.

2237
01:24:00.455 --> 01:24:02.324
It was weird that I got four pluses in a row.

2238
01:24:03.191 --> 01:24:04.526
However, that day...

2239
01:24:04.526 --> 01:24:06.027
(Why is Kwang Soo getting lucky all of a sudden?)

2240
01:24:06.027 --> 01:24:07.329
What am I supposed to do?

2241
01:24:07.329 --> 01:24:08.963
I did get a minus. How am I supposed to prove it?

2242
01:24:08.963 --> 01:24:11.533
This is what happened today, and it was different last time.

2243
01:24:13.368 --> 01:24:14.936
(What is he saying?)

2244
01:24:14.936 --> 01:24:16.471
Okay. It's strange.

2245
01:24:16.471 --> 01:24:18.606
- What is he saying? - I know it's strange.

2246
01:24:18.606 --> 01:24:20.709
"What am I supposed to do?"

2247
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:22.077
(Is it Kwang Soo or So Min who's telling the truth?)

2248
01:24:22.077 --> 01:24:23.111
I'm being honest.

2249
01:24:24.346 --> 01:24:25.847
(This is where the truth will be revealed.)

2250
01:24:25.847 --> 01:24:27.882
Why are we going bungee jumping?

2251
01:24:27.882 --> 01:24:29.851
- No way. - I won't do it.

2252
01:24:29.851 --> 01:24:31.820
- We won't do it. - We can't.

2253
01:24:31.953 --> 01:24:33.955
We can't bungee jump.

2254
01:24:33.955 --> 01:24:36.424
- We can't. - It's the one that springs up.

2255
01:24:36.424 --> 01:24:38.393
- Is it zip lining? - Seok Jin and I did it before.

2256
01:24:40.862 --> 01:24:43.231
- This is it. - That's right.

2257
01:24:43.365 --> 01:24:45.900
I don't like bungee jumping, but I don't like this either.

2258
01:24:46.101 --> 01:24:47.535
This is driving me nuts.

2259
01:24:47.535 --> 01:24:49.771
I'm sorry.

2260
01:24:49.771 --> 01:24:51.906
I'm sorry that I keep saying this,

2261
01:24:52.107 --> 01:24:57.212
but this made me wet myself a little bit.

2262
01:24:57.979 --> 01:25:00.148
What am I supposed to do about the Nevis Swing?

2263
01:25:00.148 --> 01:25:01.816
- Stop it, Haha. - Gosh.

2264
01:25:01.883 --> 01:25:03.151
Stop it.

2265
01:25:03.151 --> 01:25:05.420
Stop talking about the Nevis Swing.

2266
01:25:06.821 --> 01:25:08.323
I'd rather become their honorary ambassador.

2267
01:25:08.757 --> 01:25:10.425
It's a slingshot.

2268
01:25:10.425 --> 01:25:12.193
- Have you decided? - Yes.

2269
01:25:12.427 --> 01:25:13.495
I'm telling the truth.

2270
01:25:13.495 --> 01:25:15.029
I believe...

2271
01:25:15.029 --> 01:25:16.865
- the pieces of the puzzle... - Were you telling me the truth?

2272
01:25:16.865 --> 01:25:19.234
came together on the bus.

2273
01:25:19.367 --> 01:25:21.503
I don't know about these two.

2274
01:25:21.503 --> 01:25:22.937
Please make your final decisions.

2275
01:25:22.971 --> 01:25:25.640
If you think it was a minus, please pick Kwang Soo.

2276
01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:28.176
If you think it was a plus, please pick So Min.

2277
01:25:28.176 --> 01:25:29.477
Please decide.

2278
01:25:29.477 --> 01:25:31.212
(If it was a plus, you need to pick So Min.)

2279
01:25:31.579 --> 01:25:32.814
One,

2280
01:25:33.581 --> 01:25:34.716
two...

2281
01:25:34.716 --> 01:25:36.518
(The person with more votes gets the penalty exemption.)

2282
01:25:36.518 --> 01:25:40.522
(What will the 6 members say?)

2283
01:25:40.522 --> 01:25:41.956
- Three. - I have no idea.

2284
01:25:43.191 --> 01:25:47.061
(It's 3 on 3.)

2285
01:25:47.228 --> 01:25:50.832
- It's 3 on 3. - It's a tie.

2286
01:25:50.832 --> 01:25:52.901
- Seok Jin... - That means Kwang Soo...

2287
01:25:53.201 --> 01:25:54.335
has to go on.

2288
01:25:54.335 --> 01:25:55.770
Really? Why?

2289
01:25:55.770 --> 01:25:57.138
If there's a tie,

2290
01:25:57.138 --> 01:25:58.706
Kwang Soo has to go on.

2291
01:25:58.706 --> 01:26:00.442
He lost in the Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game.

2292
01:26:00.442 --> 01:26:02.911
Let me reveal the answer.

2293
01:26:02.911 --> 01:26:04.712
I don't know about this.

2294
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.615
I hope you're happy.

2295
01:26:07.949 --> 01:26:12.220
(Jae Seok, Jong Kook, and Se Chan picked plus.)

2296
01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:14.222
Please. Let it be a minus.

2297
01:26:14.322 --> 01:26:15.356
Please.

2298
01:26:18.092 --> 01:26:19.127
Please.

2299
01:26:20.495 --> 01:26:22.964
(Was it a plus or minus?)

2300
01:26:22.964 --> 01:26:25.900
(It's a minus.)

2301
01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:27.268
It doesn't work for you.

2302
01:26:27.268 --> 01:26:29.103
- It's a minus. - It is.

2303
01:26:29.103 --> 01:26:31.372
- It's a minus. - It's a minus.

2304
01:26:31.372 --> 01:26:33.541
(Seok Jin, Haha, and Ji Hyo get the penalty exemption.)

2305
01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:34.609
You were telling the truth.

2306
01:26:35.710 --> 01:26:37.579
Didn't we win? We guessed it right.

2307
01:26:37.579 --> 01:26:39.280
See?

2308
01:26:39.681 --> 01:26:40.949
- So Min. - Where did she go?

2309
01:26:41.716 --> 01:26:43.751
- So Min. - My gosh.

2310
01:26:43.852 --> 01:26:47.455
So Min, this won't do.

2311
01:26:48.556 --> 01:26:50.658
I won't trust her anymore.

2312
01:26:51.292 --> 01:26:52.927
Remember what I said?

2313
01:26:53.127 --> 01:26:56.197
(It's so unfair for him.)

2314
01:26:57.432 --> 01:26:59.033
Please come forward.

2315
01:26:59.033 --> 01:27:02.070
You must convince the members according to what your card says.

2316
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:04.672
Your goal is to get as many on your side as possible.

2317
01:27:04.672 --> 01:27:06.241
(He was supposed to tell the truth,)

2318
01:27:06.241 --> 01:27:11.045
(and he spun it the same way he did in Indonesia.)

2319
01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:15.016
See? It works.

2320
01:27:16.084 --> 01:27:18.686
See? He got a plus all three times.

2321
01:27:20.488 --> 01:27:21.556
See?

2322
01:27:22.423 --> 01:27:25.527
(He got pluses four times in a row.)

2323
01:27:26.227 --> 01:27:27.228
This might seem weird.

2324
01:27:27.228 --> 01:27:29.964
What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to prove it?

2325
01:27:29.964 --> 01:27:32.534
This is what happened today, and it was different last time.

2326
01:27:32.534 --> 01:27:34.469
(You should've been honest beforehand.)

2327
01:27:36.304 --> 01:27:38.306
There are four members who got selected.

2328
01:27:38.306 --> 01:27:39.574
So Min, come on.

2329
01:27:39.741 --> 01:27:42.710
Only 2 out of 4 will go on the ride.

2330
01:27:42.710 --> 01:27:43.778
- Okay. - Okay.

2331
01:27:43.778 --> 01:27:45.880
We prepared some rice cakes.

2332
01:27:45.947 --> 01:27:48.216
2 are filled with honey, and 2 are wasabi.

2333
01:27:48.216 --> 01:27:49.350
I can't do this.

2334
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:50.485
Gosh.

2335
01:27:50.485 --> 01:27:55.123
(2 are honey-filled rice cakes, and 2 are wasabi.)

2336
01:27:56.457 --> 01:27:59.961
I think this is honey, Jae Seok.

2337
01:28:00.595 --> 01:28:03.031
- Be quiet. - Go away.

2338
01:28:03.598 --> 01:28:06.167
(It's all thanks to you that we are doing this.)

2339
01:28:06.334 --> 01:28:08.236
The unlucky members can choose first.

2340
01:28:08.336 --> 01:28:09.571
- Kwang Soo, choose. - He is right.

2341
01:28:09.637 --> 01:28:12.340
It will be funny if the ones Jong Kook and Se Chan didn't pick...

2342
01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:14.242
- contain wasabi. - That's right.

2343
01:28:14.242 --> 01:28:16.144
- Hurry up. - That's why we will pick first.

2344
01:28:16.144 --> 01:28:17.512
- We will try our luck. - Okay.

2345
01:28:17.512 --> 01:28:18.947
- Okay. - Okay.

2346
01:28:19.948 --> 01:28:21.482
- I pick this one. - Okay.

2347
01:28:21.883 --> 01:28:24.052
We really are unlucky.

2348
01:28:24.052 --> 01:28:25.787
(Kwang Soo picks the rice cake Jae Seok wanted to pick.)

2349
01:28:25.787 --> 01:28:27.755
- He chose the heavy one. - I had a good feeling about it.

2350
01:28:27.822 --> 01:28:28.957
I felt an affinity...

2351
01:28:28.957 --> 01:28:30.425
- the moment I laid my eyes on it. - I bet you like that one.

2352
01:28:30.425 --> 01:28:32.060
- I knew it. - I like this one.

2353
01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.162
- I like this one. - I did, too.

2354
01:28:34.228 --> 01:28:36.731
- I will pick this one. - Okay. That's good.

2355
01:28:36.731 --> 01:28:38.132
(They finish choosing the rice cake.)

2356
01:28:38.132 --> 01:28:39.133
What's inside?

2357
01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.835
How did the unlucky members do?

2358
01:28:41.336 --> 01:28:43.071
- Shall we go? - I hope mine contains honey.

2359
01:28:43.071 --> 01:28:44.072
(It's time to choose who will go on the slingshot.)

2360
01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:50.912
(The one with wasabi rice cake are the lucky winners.)

2361
01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:57.952
(Which 2 members were chosen by wasabi rice cake?)

2362
01:28:58.953 --> 01:29:01.155
- In 2, 3. - Wasabi will hit them hard.

2363
01:29:01.155 --> 01:29:02.323
(They put rice cake in their mouths at the same time.)

2364
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:04.092
Wasabi will hit them hard.

2365
01:29:04.325 --> 01:29:05.760
It hit Jae Seok.

2366
01:29:06.327 --> 01:29:08.363
- Jae Seok is enduring it. - That's right.

2367
01:29:08.363 --> 01:29:09.631
It hit Jae Seok.

2368
01:29:10.231 --> 01:29:12.000
(My goodness.)

2369
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.267
Does mine contain honey?

2370
01:29:13.267 --> 01:29:14.402
It hit Se Chan.

2371
01:29:14.402 --> 01:29:16.170
- It hit Se Chan. - It hit Se Chan.

2372
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:17.338
(Jae Seok and Se Chan eat wasabi rice cake.)

2373
01:29:17.338 --> 01:29:18.506
It's Jae Seok and Se Chan.

2374
01:29:20.408 --> 01:29:22.043
Are they okay?

2375
01:29:22.343 --> 01:29:23.344
Is it sweet? How does it taste?

2376
01:29:24.245 --> 01:29:26.147
- It's Se Chan. - It's Se Chan.

2377
01:29:26.147 --> 01:29:27.548
(Jae Seok and Se Chan are chosen to go on the slingshot.)

2378
01:29:27.548 --> 01:29:28.850
Se Chan is struggling.

2379
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:30.551
(Jae Seok pretends like it isn't him.)

2380
01:29:31.019 --> 01:29:32.754
Jae Seok, you will die if you eat it.

2381
01:29:32.754 --> 01:29:35.757
(Don't pretend like yours isn't wasabi rice cake.)

2382
01:29:35.757 --> 01:29:37.592
- Look at him. - Gosh, I can smell it.

2383
01:29:38.026 --> 01:29:39.027
Jae Seok.

2384
01:29:40.128 --> 01:29:41.529
- Jae Seok. - Brush your teeth.

2385
01:29:41.529 --> 01:29:47.402
You have wasabi on your front teeth.

2386
01:29:47.402 --> 01:29:50.405
(Wasabi colors his teeth green.)

2387
01:29:50.705 --> 01:29:52.373
I can smell wasabi from here.

2388
01:29:53.841 --> 01:29:54.876
Doesn't it make your teeth tingle?

2389
01:29:54.876 --> 01:29:57.945
(With the taste of wasabi in their mouths,)

2390
01:29:57.945 --> 01:30:00.882
(Jae Seok and Se Chan board the slingshot.)

2391
01:30:02.116 --> 01:30:03.951
How should we position our heads?

2392
01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:06.821
- My goodness. - This is happening for real.

2393
01:30:07.055 --> 01:30:09.123
They're pulling the ropes now, right?

2394
01:30:09.357 --> 01:30:10.892
Make it tight like a slingshot.

2395
01:30:11.159 --> 01:30:12.326
I am so scared.
