3
00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:23.364
Hey, Jung Hee.

4
00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:27.175
Jung Hee.

5
00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:29.474
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:31.745
I...

7
00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:35.345
Ae Sook.

8
00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:37.014
What?

9
00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:38.654
I...

10
00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:40.955
need to talk to you.

11
00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:44.224
What is it? Darn it.

12
00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:47.565
Shoot.

13
00:00:50.294 --> 00:00:51.535
What is it?

14
00:00:52.194 --> 00:00:55.264
Why did I drag Ae Sook away...

15
00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:57.135
like that at that moment?

16
00:00:57.934 --> 00:00:59.275
For Ae Sook?

17
00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:00.974
For Hae Joo?

18
00:01:00.974 --> 00:01:02.175
What is it?

19
00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:10.314
Did you see my twin brother Bong Soo...

20
00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.454
at the coffee shop in town?

21
00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:16.255
What? Are you stupid?

22
00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:17.924
Why are you asking me?

23
00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:21.394
Young Choon is the only man I see.

24
00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:22.965
That fish head?

25
00:01:22.965 --> 00:01:24.865
I'm not interested in the slightest.

26
00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:27.764
Why is Bong Soo a fish head?

27
00:01:27.764 --> 00:01:29.904
The fish head is Dong Moon.

28
00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:44.055
Dong Moon must be soaked.

29
00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:46.454
Has she lost her mind?

30
00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:47.585
(Episode 6)

31
00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:49.355
Why is she asking me about that fish head?

32
00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:55.325
Hey, Hae Joo. I warned you...

33
00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:57.534
to stay away from Young Choon.

34
00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:00.034
Stay away?

35
00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:01.404
You stay away.

36
00:02:03.034 --> 00:02:04.534
What were you doing inside?

37
00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:07.704
What else? I sold her medicine.

38
00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:09.105
What medicine?

39
00:02:13.984 --> 00:02:16.815
What? What medicine did you sell her?

40
00:02:17.385 --> 00:02:19.514
Who goes to a pharmacy so often?

41
00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:21.355
Young Choon!

42
00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:33.605
Jung Hee.

43
00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:35.734
Hae Joo.

44
00:02:37.304 --> 00:02:38.575
Are you okay?

45
00:02:41.674 --> 00:02:42.674
And you?

46
00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:45.744
I'm fine.

47
00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:49.815
See you at school.

48
00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:54.785
Jung Hee.

49
00:02:58.024 --> 00:03:00.924
Thank you for taking the punishment with me.

50
00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:03.935
I told you.

51
00:03:04.364 --> 00:03:06.364
I didn't do it for you.

52
00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:10.174
Bye.

53
00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:16.345
Still.

54
00:03:17.445 --> 00:03:18.514
Thank you.

55
00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:21.915
Darn it, Jung Hee.

56
00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:24.285
Why can't you give a cool response?

57
00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:51.945
Why do you keep going to that communist's house?

58
00:03:57.285 --> 00:03:58.285
Hae Joo!

59
00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:05.294
Jin.

60
00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.394
Sorry for coming back.

61
00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:10.994
How's your father?

62
00:04:11.394 --> 00:04:12.494
He's fine.

63
00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.804
Good. I'm glad.

64
00:04:20.104 --> 00:04:21.104
You look...

65
00:04:22.144 --> 00:04:23.375
terrible.

66
00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:26.375
I'm fine too.

67
00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:29.084
Look.

68
00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:35.055
If you need anything,

69
00:04:35.584 --> 00:04:36.795
call me.

70
00:04:37.894 --> 00:04:38.894
Promise.

71
00:04:42.464 --> 00:04:43.594
Thank you.

72
00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:01.644
Your legs are all hard. You poor thing.

73
00:05:01.644 --> 00:05:03.854
Don't tell my mom and dad...

74
00:05:03.854 --> 00:05:04.954
that I was punished.

75
00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:06.454
Don't you worry.

76
00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:22.104
Auntie.

77
00:05:22.735 --> 00:05:26.274
- Yes? - Can two people...

78
00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:29.075
of very different status like each other?

79
00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:32.414
Like a servant...

80
00:05:32.914 --> 00:05:35.014
and the master's daughter.

81
00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:36.315
I don't know.

82
00:05:37.214 --> 00:05:39.115
I think so. No?

83
00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:42.055
I read in a book...

84
00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:45.224
that true love is being blind to status...

85
00:05:45.224 --> 00:05:46.925
and money.

86
00:05:47.524 --> 00:05:48.695
Have you ever...

87
00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:51.135
experienced love like that?

88
00:05:53.034 --> 00:05:54.034
What?

89
00:05:59.204 --> 00:06:00.545
What are you two doing?

90
00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:05.774
The two of you get along so well.

91
00:06:06.014 --> 00:06:09.344
People would think you were Auntie's child.

92
00:06:09.344 --> 00:06:11.755
What? Am I not Auntie's child?

93
00:06:11.755 --> 00:06:13.055
I thought I was.

94
00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:16.024
How did you know?

95
00:06:16.224 --> 00:06:17.724
That was top secret.

96
00:06:19.695 --> 00:06:22.495
Auntie. Bring in some more soybean paste.

97
00:06:22.495 --> 00:06:23.594
Yes, ma'am.

98
00:06:23.594 --> 00:06:25.365
You're not eating dinner, you brat.

99
00:06:35.704 --> 00:06:38.144
My gosh. That looks good.

100
00:06:38.844 --> 00:06:39.844
Let's eat.

101
00:06:41.385 --> 00:06:42.445
Hold on.

102
00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:46.055
This afternoon, the town leaders and I...

103
00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:48.325
went to the meeting of...

104
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:50.195
the justice committee...

105
00:06:50.495 --> 00:06:52.255
at the police station.

106
00:06:54.224 --> 00:06:55.224
Jung Hee.

107
00:06:55.394 --> 00:06:57.995
There's a Park Hae Joo in your class, right?

108
00:06:58.334 --> 00:06:59.995
- What? - What about Olivia?

109
00:07:01.664 --> 00:07:04.404
Ol... Olivia?

110
00:07:04.675 --> 00:07:06.534
No... Nothing.

111
00:07:06.604 --> 00:07:09.344
Jung Hee, are you close with her?

112
00:07:13.714 --> 00:07:17.615
She isn't close at all with that girl. Why?

113
00:07:17.615 --> 00:07:21.185
Good. Stay away from that Park Hae Joo girl...

114
00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:22.784
from now on too. Okay?

115
00:07:24.055 --> 00:07:25.055
Why?

116
00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:26.594
What do you mean?

117
00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:31.534
Did that rumor reach the police too?

118
00:07:32.635 --> 00:07:33.664
What rumor?

119
00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:36.065
You know too?

120
00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:39.534
Don't you mean about her and Young Choon dating?

121
00:07:39.534 --> 00:07:42.545
- What? - With Young Choon?

122
00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:43.745
What do you mean?

123
00:07:43.745 --> 00:07:46.745
That Park Hae Joo girl is dating that thug,

124
00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:48.344
Young Choon?

125
00:07:48.584 --> 00:07:49.844
Madam.

126
00:07:51.485 --> 00:07:52.854
Is that not it?

127
00:07:52.854 --> 00:07:54.055
Mom.

128
00:07:54.055 --> 00:07:57.024
I told you. Hae Joo is not dating Young Choon.

129
00:07:57.154 --> 00:07:59.024
How do you know?

130
00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:00.164
Whatever.

131
00:08:00.524 --> 00:08:02.394
Anyway. Jung Hee,

132
00:08:02.695 --> 00:08:06.534
don't even talk to Park Hae Joo, got it?

133
00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:10.575
Let's eat.

134
00:08:13.604 --> 00:08:16.344
Thank you for your hard work.

135
00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:18.914
Thanksgiving is just around the corner,

136
00:08:18.914 --> 00:08:20.885
so please keep it up until then.

137
00:08:21.045 --> 00:08:22.584
- Okay. - Okay.

138
00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:26.885
Gosh. It's gotten so late.

139
00:08:28.284 --> 00:08:29.784
I hear...

140
00:08:29.985 --> 00:08:32.224
there's some weird guy in the next town over.

141
00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:35.724
That pervert, right?

142
00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.494
- Yes. - I heard.

143
00:08:37.494 --> 00:08:40.405
This rat hides until a woman comes...

144
00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:42.665
and opens his coat when one is near.

145
00:08:43.805 --> 00:08:45.474
That's what I heard!

146
00:08:45.474 --> 00:08:47.704
That little worm.

147
00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:50.445
Number three. Don't you live there?

148
00:08:50.445 --> 00:08:52.015
I do.

149
00:08:52.015 --> 00:08:54.685
That's right. You do.

150
00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:58.515
Okay, okay! I'm here to close up the factory!

151
00:08:58.515 --> 00:08:59.954
I'm glad you're here.

152
00:08:59.954 --> 00:09:02.224
Take number three home.

153
00:09:04.724 --> 00:09:07.765
No. I have no time. I have homework.

154
00:09:07.765 --> 00:09:10.065
Brat. Since when did you care about homework?

155
00:09:10.065 --> 00:09:13.364
That's true, but I really don't have time today.

156
00:09:13.364 --> 00:09:15.604
It's okay. I always went by myself anyway.

157
00:09:15.604 --> 00:09:16.734
See? She's fine.

158
00:09:16.734 --> 00:09:19.834
- Right? - You are such a coward.

159
00:09:19.834 --> 00:09:20.974
I'm your son!

160
00:09:20.974 --> 00:09:22.045
Gibberish.

161
00:09:22.045 --> 00:09:23.305
- Whatever. Bye. - Hey.

162
00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:25.344
Let's wrap up and go!

163
00:09:25.575 --> 00:09:26.714
Go home.

164
00:09:26.714 --> 00:09:28.185
- Good night. - Let's go.

165
00:09:32.915 --> 00:09:34.025
What was that?

166
00:09:34.384 --> 00:09:36.454
Is it that pervert?

167
00:09:39.825 --> 00:09:43.634
Mommy. I'm so scared. Mommy.

168
00:09:46.435 --> 00:09:49.104
Mommy!

169
00:09:49.104 --> 00:09:50.234
Mommy!

170
00:09:50.234 --> 00:09:51.504
Hey, you pervert!

171
00:09:52.075 --> 00:09:54.175
You jerk!

172
00:09:55.905 --> 00:09:57.045
Come here!

173
00:10:05.214 --> 00:10:06.384
Jerk!

174
00:10:06.884 --> 00:10:07.984
You...

175
00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:11.555
Are you all right?

176
00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:14.724
Here.

177
00:10:15.695 --> 00:10:18.134
- Try getting up. - Okay.

178
00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:24.004
Aren't you from Jung Hee's factory?

179
00:10:27.145 --> 00:10:28.945
You're Jung Hee's teacher.

180
00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:31.575
Thank you so much.

181
00:10:31.974 --> 00:10:33.915
You're bleeding.

182
00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:36.954
- Pardon? - You can wipe with this.

183
00:10:37.584 --> 00:10:39.315
- Are you okay? - Yes.

184
00:10:39.484 --> 00:10:42.254
What do I do? You're bleeding a lot.

185
00:10:43.084 --> 00:10:44.854
- Thank you. - Yes.

186
00:11:07.185 --> 00:11:09.445
Here, wear these.

187
00:11:10.214 --> 00:11:12.614
- Are those socks? - I want to thank you.

188
00:11:20.425 --> 00:11:22.594
- A communist? - Be quiet.

189
00:11:23.895 --> 00:11:26.364
Hae Joo's dad is a communist?

190
00:11:26.805 --> 00:11:28.665
- Are you sure? - Yes.

191
00:11:29.035 --> 00:11:32.575
Her dad disappeared for a few days.

192
00:11:33.004 --> 00:11:36.104
It turns out, he was taken for interrogation.

193
00:11:36.374 --> 00:11:37.545
Really?

194
00:11:44.254 --> 00:11:45.685
Do you want me to teach you?

195
00:11:53.395 --> 00:11:55.165
Hae Joo was punished?

196
00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:57.094
Yes, Jung Hee too.

197
00:11:59.494 --> 00:12:00.704
I think...

198
00:12:01.364 --> 00:12:04.374
everyone seems to dislike Hae Joo.

199
00:12:05.035 --> 00:12:08.004
From what I heard, her father...

200
00:12:08.004 --> 00:12:10.004
is an activist professor.

201
00:12:17.655 --> 00:12:18.685
Did you know?

202
00:12:20.254 --> 00:12:21.984
My father is a police chief.

203
00:12:23.954 --> 00:12:25.254
You're in big trouble.

204
00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:27.624
How can you say such a thing to me?

205
00:12:27.925 --> 00:12:29.765
I know you're a hypocrite,

206
00:12:31.535 --> 00:12:33.905
but I don't think you would be so shameless.

207
00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.575
You're wrong.

208
00:12:38.275 --> 00:12:39.775
I'm shameless.

209
00:12:51.614 --> 00:12:54.224
It's my number. Call me if something happens...

210
00:12:55.084 --> 00:12:56.354
to Hae Joo.

211
00:12:57.624 --> 00:13:00.665
Today's lesson...

212
00:13:00.724 --> 00:13:02.395
is for civilians like yourselves...

213
00:13:02.525 --> 00:13:04.864
to be able to provide first aid during a war...

214
00:13:04.864 --> 00:13:07.964
for the injured soldiers.

215
00:13:08.004 --> 00:13:10.775
It would be a training for triumph.

216
00:13:11.474 --> 00:13:14.645
It's a very necessary training.

217
00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:19.214
I explained it to you so much. What is this?

218
00:13:23.285 --> 00:13:24.384
Hae Joo.

219
00:13:25.285 --> 00:13:27.785
You did it nice and tight.

220
00:13:29.285 --> 00:13:32.195
Look here. This is how it should be.

221
00:13:38.094 --> 00:13:39.165
All right.

222
00:13:39.494 --> 00:13:42.464
Next up, we'll try the sling.

223
00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:01.155
"Go away, communist"?

224
00:14:09.195 --> 00:14:10.494
What is this?

225
00:14:13.265 --> 00:14:14.435
Who did this?

226
00:14:18.035 --> 00:14:19.234
Shim Ae Sook.

227
00:14:21.844 --> 00:14:23.614
- It's you, isn't it? - What?

228
00:14:35.884 --> 00:14:38.655
- It's not me. - Don't lie.

229
00:14:39.325 --> 00:14:40.364
Ma'am.

230
00:14:42.895 --> 00:14:44.165
It's not...

231
00:14:45.334 --> 00:14:46.634
Ae Sook.

232
00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:49.805
Then who did it?

233
00:14:51.134 --> 00:14:52.234
What?

234
00:14:53.334 --> 00:14:54.504
Anyway,

235
00:14:56.045 --> 00:14:58.275
it wasn't her.

236
00:15:12.124 --> 00:15:13.224
Hey.

237
00:15:18.065 --> 00:15:19.665
Did you tell Kyo Ryun...

238
00:15:20.234 --> 00:15:22.305
- that it was me? - I'm not like you.

239
00:15:22.435 --> 00:15:23.734
I wouldn't tattle like a coward.

240
00:15:23.734 --> 00:15:25.874
Don't you dare tell her.

241
00:15:26.474 --> 00:15:28.004
If you do...

242
00:15:29.445 --> 00:15:30.714
What?

243
00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:40.285
- Park Gwi Ja. - Yes?

244
00:15:40.655 --> 00:15:43.724
I dare you to frame me one more time.

245
00:15:44.624 --> 00:15:46.594
I'll pull out your eyes...

246
00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:50.494
and give them to kids to play with marbles.

247
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.134
Okay?

248
00:15:54.905 --> 00:15:56.234
I won't do it again.

249
00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:58.535
I'm leaving...

250
00:16:02.805 --> 00:16:05.244
Hey! You're a bully.

251
00:16:05.244 --> 00:16:06.614
You little...

252
00:16:10.484 --> 00:16:11.685
Lee Jung Hee.

253
00:16:12.884 --> 00:16:14.384
Do you think I'll thank you...

254
00:16:14.384 --> 00:16:15.884
for taking my side?

255
00:16:17.494 --> 00:16:18.695
No way.

256
00:16:20.665 --> 00:16:22.165
Don't be mistaken.

257
00:16:22.165 --> 00:16:24.265
I didn't take your side.

258
00:16:26.834 --> 00:16:28.004
Aren't you going to the washroom?

259
00:16:40.645 --> 00:16:43.185
What's wrong with you? Mom! She's crazy!

260
00:16:43.685 --> 00:16:45.384
- Just this once. - Don't!

261
00:16:45.384 --> 00:16:47.325
- Don't touch my head! - I have to practice!

262
00:16:47.325 --> 00:16:49.185
- Come on. - Don't touch me!

263
00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:51.655
- Mom! - Come on, just once.

264
00:16:52.454 --> 00:16:53.525
Jung Hee.

265
00:16:54.765 --> 00:16:55.994
Let's start our tutor lesson.

266
00:17:02.165 --> 00:17:04.374
Stay still.

267
00:17:05.134 --> 00:17:06.205
Okay.

268
00:17:08.005 --> 00:17:11.015
It's hard to do since you have uneven hair.

269
00:17:17.854 --> 00:17:19.815
You look really familiar.

270
00:17:20.924 --> 00:17:22.084
Don't I...

271
00:17:22.755 --> 00:17:25.225
look a lot like Anthony?

272
00:17:25.455 --> 00:17:26.924
An injured Anthony.

273
00:17:37.604 --> 00:17:39.174
No, it's not Anthony.

274
00:17:44.275 --> 00:17:45.344
What is this?

275
00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:48.245
Hey, I figured it out.

276
00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:50.914
You look like Kkeobeong.

277
00:17:51.584 --> 00:17:53.084
Gil Chang Deok's Kkeobeong.

278
00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.154
Kkeobeong?

279
00:17:54.154 --> 00:17:55.825
- Ouch. What? - Hey.

280
00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.525
He looks like Kkeobeong.

281
00:17:57.725 --> 00:17:59.255
Doesn't he?

282
00:18:00.795 --> 00:18:02.225
He's Kkeobeong.

283
00:18:03.194 --> 00:18:04.735
- He looks just like him. - You're Kkeobeong.

284
00:18:05.065 --> 00:18:06.465
Don't you know him?

285
00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:09.334
- What's Kkeobeong? - That's you.

286
00:18:09.465 --> 00:18:10.505
You look like him.

287
00:18:14.775 --> 00:18:17.644
Hold it up. This is the injured arm.

288
00:18:18.344 --> 00:18:19.775
Gosh.

289
00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:21.985
I have to make dinner.

290
00:18:22.215 --> 00:18:24.184
I did well on my midterms.

291
00:18:24.515 --> 00:18:26.184
If I do well on the practical exam,

292
00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:28.225
I might bring my mark up.

293
00:18:28.225 --> 00:18:31.694
That's why I'm letting you do this to my head.

294
00:18:32.594 --> 00:18:35.894
But looking at you, this is not your thing.

295
00:18:36.465 --> 00:18:40.265
You're bad with your hands just like your dad.

296
00:18:40.265 --> 00:18:42.965
- Don't you agree? - She just needs practice.

297
00:18:43.475 --> 00:18:45.834
Come and grab this. Is anyone home?

298
00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:47.874
Yes. Coming!

299
00:18:49.404 --> 00:18:50.844
Are you home?

300
00:18:50.844 --> 00:18:53.075
The manager kept on insisting I take this.

301
00:18:58.614 --> 00:19:00.455
Did you get hurt? How?

302
00:19:01.184 --> 00:19:03.795
- It's not... - Why won't you...

303
00:19:03.854 --> 00:19:05.894
be careful?

304
00:19:06.025 --> 00:19:08.664
Don't get hurt. Don't take it off.

305
00:19:18.075 --> 00:19:21.245
What's going on? What's with the bandages?

306
00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:23.374
It's Jung Hee's homework.

307
00:19:24.715 --> 00:19:25.715
Homework?

308
00:19:28.785 --> 00:19:30.715
Gosh, what a bother.

309
00:19:34.285 --> 00:19:37.555
What's with the fuss? It's not like him.

310
00:19:37.894 --> 00:19:41.225
He acted like Bong Soo got hurt.

311
00:20:11.194 --> 00:20:13.354
Are you back?

312
00:20:13.664 --> 00:20:17.094
It feels like you're always wiping...

313
00:20:17.094 --> 00:20:19.634
this disgusting chamber pot.

314
00:20:20.364 --> 00:20:21.364
Gosh.

315
00:20:27.075 --> 00:20:29.104
By the way,

316
00:20:29.705 --> 00:20:31.215
you said that...

317
00:20:31.374 --> 00:20:33.884
you got separated with your husband?

318
00:20:34.815 --> 00:20:36.614
It's not really a separation.

319
00:20:37.154 --> 00:20:38.914
I was thrown out.

320
00:20:38.914 --> 00:20:41.154
Did he find a new woman?

321
00:20:41.924 --> 00:20:43.055
Yes.

322
00:20:44.755 --> 00:20:47.225
What an evil man. He deserves to die.

323
00:20:47.694 --> 00:20:49.624
How can he leave such a beautiful wife?

324
00:20:57.904 --> 00:21:00.705
You should find yourself a partner.

325
00:21:01.944 --> 00:21:03.815
How can you keep living like this?

326
00:21:07.584 --> 00:21:10.485
Right. We should be receiving...

327
00:21:10.815 --> 00:21:12.715
the fabric at the factory today.

328
00:21:13.455 --> 00:21:14.755
I'll get going.

329
00:21:28.235 --> 00:21:29.334
Now,

330
00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:31.505
we'll pick partners to perform...

331
00:21:31.505 --> 00:21:33.545
our bandaging practical exam.

332
00:21:39.075 --> 00:21:40.545
Park Gwi Ja...

333
00:21:42.644 --> 00:21:43.755
and Kim Uhn Joo.

334
00:21:45.884 --> 00:21:47.255
Kim Ki Ryuh...

335
00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:51.094
and Shim Ae Sook.

336
00:21:53.965 --> 00:21:55.565
Lee Jung Hee...

337
00:21:57.465 --> 00:21:58.834
You're lucky, Jung Hee.

338
00:22:00.164 --> 00:22:01.364
Park Hae Joo.

339
00:22:01.604 --> 00:22:03.575
I'm jealous.

340
00:22:03.934 --> 00:22:05.475
Ahn Jae Yeon...

341
00:22:06.134 --> 00:22:07.275
and Kim Hong Joo.

342
00:22:07.874 --> 00:22:10.045
- Ki Ryuh. - Stay still.

343
00:22:10.045 --> 00:22:11.344
How do I use this?

344
00:22:11.344 --> 00:22:13.584
- You have to do this. - I know.

345
00:22:13.584 --> 00:22:14.644
What are you doing?

346
00:22:14.644 --> 00:22:17.354
Do you want to go practice at home?

347
00:22:17.955 --> 00:22:19.315
No way.

348
00:22:19.884 --> 00:22:21.985
You want to go to your place...

349
00:22:22.725 --> 00:22:24.055
to practice?

350
00:22:25.894 --> 00:22:29.295
My dad is ill,

351
00:22:29.624 --> 00:22:30.834
so I'm worried.

352
00:22:35.334 --> 00:22:37.904
We can practice here if you don't want to.

353
00:22:40.575 --> 00:22:43.815
It's okay. Let's go to your place.

354
00:22:52.455 --> 00:22:53.555
- Done. - Guys.

355
00:22:54.154 --> 00:22:56.525
Here, have some of this.

356
00:22:56.525 --> 00:22:57.854
Dad, that's heavy.

357
00:22:57.854 --> 00:22:59.325
- No, no. - I was going to bring it.

358
00:22:59.325 --> 00:23:01.894
It's okay, I'm fine now.

359
00:23:02.225 --> 00:23:04.795
Jung Hee, do you like tteokbokki?

360
00:23:04.795 --> 00:23:06.664
I make a mean tteokbokki.

361
00:23:06.664 --> 00:23:07.805
Do you want some?

362
00:23:08.765 --> 00:23:10.535
Yes, please make it for us.

363
00:23:10.674 --> 00:23:12.904
His tteokbokki is the best.

364
00:23:13.104 --> 00:23:15.805
Great. Let me make some.

365
00:23:16.075 --> 00:23:17.174
Hae Joo.

366
00:23:17.174 --> 00:23:20.075
-Yes? - Play some music.

367
00:23:20.075 --> 00:23:21.745
Oh, right.

368
00:23:24.384 --> 00:23:25.985
I'll take requests.

369
00:23:25.985 --> 00:23:27.924
Okay, then...

370
00:23:28.455 --> 00:23:30.225
I want Hyun Kyung and Young Ae's "I Miss You".

371
00:23:30.225 --> 00:23:32.124
That's a good one.

372
00:23:32.124 --> 00:23:34.094
I want to listen to Hye Eun Yi.

373
00:23:34.965 --> 00:23:36.124
What about you, Jung Hee?

374
00:23:37.694 --> 00:23:38.795
I'm not sure.

375
00:23:39.235 --> 00:23:41.205
Hae Joo, play "Hey Jude" too.

376
00:23:41.205 --> 00:23:42.965
Okay, sure.

377
00:23:49.045 --> 00:23:50.144
It was shocking.

378
00:23:50.144 --> 00:23:52.444
- Dad. - What?

379
00:23:52.444 --> 00:23:55.384
Unlike my dad who calls me names...

380
00:23:55.614 --> 00:23:57.985
and practices authority over us,

381
00:23:59.184 --> 00:24:00.384
Hae Joo's dad...

382
00:24:00.985 --> 00:24:03.255
was nice like a friend.

383
00:24:04.394 --> 00:24:07.525
To me, it was shocking.

384
00:24:10.065 --> 00:24:11.634
Here, try it.

385
00:24:24.674 --> 00:24:25.674
How is it?

386
00:24:27.384 --> 00:24:28.614
It's delicious.

387
00:24:31.515 --> 00:24:33.854
I was so nervous. Wait.

388
00:24:34.025 --> 00:24:35.285
I'll bring you water.

389
00:24:35.285 --> 00:24:36.354
Okay.

390
00:24:39.094 --> 00:24:40.194
My dad...

391
00:24:40.725 --> 00:24:42.465
must be in a good mood.

392
00:24:53.174 --> 00:24:55.205
Thank you, Jung Hee.

393
00:24:55.874 --> 00:24:57.315
For what?

394
00:24:57.874 --> 00:24:59.315
For coming over.

395
00:25:01.844 --> 00:25:03.914
It's been a long time...

396
00:25:03.914 --> 00:25:05.354
since I've seen him smile.

397
00:25:06.485 --> 00:25:08.354
Come over often.

398
00:25:08.985 --> 00:25:10.055
Will you?

399
00:25:11.094 --> 00:25:12.094
Come on.

400
00:25:13.664 --> 00:25:14.664
Okay.

401
00:25:22.805 --> 00:25:23.874
Dad!

402
00:25:24.275 --> 00:25:26.075
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

403
00:25:26.075 --> 00:25:28.075
- I'm fine. - Dad!

404
00:25:28.245 --> 00:25:30.575
No! What do I do? Dad!

405
00:25:30.575 --> 00:25:32.475
Are you okay? What do I do?

406
00:25:32.475 --> 00:25:33.614
Dad!

407
00:25:34.285 --> 00:25:35.344
Dad!

408
00:25:36.414 --> 00:25:38.015
Dad!

409
00:25:45.394 --> 00:25:46.825
Yes, Jung Hee.

410
00:25:48.424 --> 00:25:49.424
Hae Joo...

411
00:25:50.295 --> 00:25:51.765
Hae Joo's dad...

412
00:25:58.205 --> 00:26:00.575
Dad. Dad...

413
00:26:04.075 --> 00:26:05.575
- Be careful. - Okay.

414
00:26:10.785 --> 00:26:12.384
Be careful. Good.

415
00:26:13.825 --> 00:26:15.654
Hae Joo, I'll be right behind you.

416
00:26:28.005 --> 00:26:29.005
Jung Hee.

417
00:26:31.505 --> 00:26:32.575
Jung Hee!

418
00:26:35.045 --> 00:26:36.775
- What happened? - Dong Moon,

419
00:26:36.975 --> 00:26:38.475
Hae Joo's dad...

420
00:26:45.884 --> 00:26:47.325
You must be startled.

421
00:26:47.354 --> 00:26:48.424
It's okay.

422
00:26:49.725 --> 00:26:51.025
He'll be fine.

423
00:26:54.864 --> 00:26:57.295
- What did you say? - We performed first aid,

424
00:26:57.295 --> 00:26:59.265
but our director is in Seoul right now.

425
00:26:59.265 --> 00:27:01.305
He can't get treatment right away.

426
00:27:01.305 --> 00:27:04.374
Then please send him to another hospital.

427
00:27:04.904 --> 00:27:07.944
I'm scared if something very serious...

428
00:27:07.944 --> 00:27:09.045
has happened to him.

429
00:27:09.045 --> 00:27:11.245
That's not something I can decide.

430
00:27:11.245 --> 00:27:13.545
Someone's life is on the line.

431
00:27:13.545 --> 00:27:15.515
You can't decide?

432
00:27:16.785 --> 00:27:19.455
Are you joking me? If there is no doctor,

433
00:27:19.455 --> 00:27:20.955
then find us a new hospital!

434
00:27:20.955 --> 00:27:23.084
Who are you yelling at?

435
00:27:23.084 --> 00:27:24.094
It's not like that...

436
00:27:24.094 --> 00:27:25.995
The patient coughed up blood and fainted.

437
00:27:25.995 --> 00:27:27.795
How can you say that?

438
00:27:27.795 --> 00:27:29.065
Jung Hee.

439
00:27:29.594 --> 00:27:32.664
Ma'am, please send him to another hospital.

440
00:27:34.434 --> 00:27:35.705
I'll look at him.

441
00:27:35.705 --> 00:27:37.735
What brings you here, sir?

442
00:27:37.735 --> 00:27:39.205
- Is this the room? - Yes.

443
00:27:41.705 --> 00:27:42.775
I brought him.

444
00:27:42.775 --> 00:27:44.644
How did you know?

445
00:27:44.644 --> 00:27:46.475
I called Jin.

446
00:27:48.884 --> 00:27:50.584
He's my uncle.

447
00:27:50.955 --> 00:27:52.684
He works at a university hospital.

448
00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:54.584
He talked to the director of this hospital,

449
00:27:54.584 --> 00:27:55.884
so he'll take good care of your dad.

450
00:27:57.295 --> 00:27:58.624
Thank you.

451
00:27:59.694 --> 00:28:02.025
Thank you so much, Jin.

452
00:28:23.045 --> 00:28:25.515
It's tuberculosis? Is it serious?

453
00:28:25.515 --> 00:28:27.654
We don't have to worry for now.

454
00:28:36.525 --> 00:28:39.035
Really? What do we do?

455
00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:41.265
Is he okay now?

456
00:28:41.334 --> 00:28:42.465
Yes.

457
00:28:43.505 --> 00:28:46.705
That's why I have to stay here for tonight.

458
00:28:46.705 --> 00:28:48.444
Hae Joo doesn't have a mom,

459
00:28:48.604 --> 00:28:49.904
so I feel bad for her.

460
00:28:50.614 --> 00:28:51.914
Tell Mom...

461
00:28:51.914 --> 00:28:54.545
I'm staying at Eun Ja's to practice for the exam.

462
00:28:55.015 --> 00:28:56.084
Hey.

463
00:28:57.084 --> 00:28:58.184
Hello?

464
00:29:01.084 --> 00:29:03.225
Okay, I got it.

465
00:29:03.225 --> 00:29:05.325
Call me if something happens.

466
00:29:05.325 --> 00:29:06.725
Okay, be careful.

467
00:29:06.725 --> 00:29:07.864
Okay.

468
00:29:09.594 --> 00:29:11.094
Ma'am...

469
00:29:13.265 --> 00:29:15.834
Jung Hee is definitely your daughter.

470
00:29:16.205 --> 00:29:19.505
She tells you whenever something happens.

471
00:29:20.775 --> 00:29:23.104
That's not true.

472
00:29:30.414 --> 00:29:31.584
Take some food...

473
00:29:31.584 --> 00:29:34.725
to the hospital tomorrow for Jung Hee.

474
00:29:36.055 --> 00:29:37.495
Okay.

475
00:29:48.505 --> 00:29:50.305
That girl...

476
00:29:50.904 --> 00:29:54.075
Why is she scared of telling me the truth?

477
00:29:57.099 --> 00:30:00.331
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E06 Girls' Generation 1979 "Dangerous Instincts"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

478
00:30:08.584 --> 00:30:11.755
Do you really not have to go home?

479
00:30:11.955 --> 00:30:13.894
My mom gave me permission.

480
00:30:15.194 --> 00:30:17.795
Your parents don't complain...

481
00:30:17.894 --> 00:30:19.364
about being with me?

482
00:30:19.995 --> 00:30:21.035
What?

483
00:30:22.265 --> 00:30:23.475
I know...

484
00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:27.045
that the adults don't like my family.

485
00:30:29.275 --> 00:30:30.815
What do you mean?

486
00:30:31.344 --> 00:30:33.144
Why would they not?

487
00:30:34.245 --> 00:30:36.914
I'm so envious of you.

488
00:30:38.215 --> 00:30:41.684
I grew up with a father who constantly says...

489
00:30:42.485 --> 00:30:45.725
"a girl" this, "a girl" that.

490
00:30:47.664 --> 00:30:50.664
I've never seen a father who's so nice...

491
00:30:50.834 --> 00:30:52.194
to his daughter.

492
00:30:54.005 --> 00:30:57.934
You have no idea how much I envy you.

493
00:31:00.644 --> 00:31:02.545
Thank you, Jung Hee.

494
00:31:05.975 --> 00:31:07.584
Shouldn't...

495
00:31:08.344 --> 00:31:10.684
Dong Moon go home?

496
00:31:10.914 --> 00:31:12.015
It's fine.

497
00:31:14.154 --> 00:31:15.985
My family doesn't care about me.

498
00:31:16.684 --> 00:31:17.894
Liar.

499
00:31:22.025 --> 00:31:23.535
Your dad's awake.

500
00:32:05.735 --> 00:32:06.805
Hi.

501
00:32:09.245 --> 00:32:11.315
My dad came home.

502
00:32:15.414 --> 00:32:16.755
Thank you.

503
00:32:18.084 --> 00:32:19.414
I didn't do anything.

504
00:32:19.755 --> 00:32:20.924
Mister.

505
00:32:21.255 --> 00:32:23.525
I know you stayed at the hospital...

506
00:32:24.325 --> 00:32:25.424
until morning.

507
00:32:29.565 --> 00:32:32.565
It made me feel safe.

508
00:32:34.834 --> 00:32:36.235
I wasn't afraid.

509
00:32:41.374 --> 00:32:43.075
Goodness.

510
00:32:46.884 --> 00:32:47.985
Don't you have a delivery to make?

511
00:32:47.985 --> 00:32:50.354
- I'm going. - Hurry up.

512
00:32:54.725 --> 00:32:56.485
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

513
00:33:03.565 --> 00:33:05.694
Do you mean it?

514
00:33:06.465 --> 00:33:07.604
Yes.

515
00:33:08.535 --> 00:33:10.735
Your father processed it.

516
00:33:14.174 --> 00:33:17.975
He also said if you see that girl Hae Joo again,

517
00:33:18.545 --> 00:33:20.785
it'll be bad for her father.

518
00:33:29.525 --> 00:33:30.755
Where are you going?

519
00:33:35.624 --> 00:33:36.694
Jin.

520
00:33:59.815 --> 00:34:02.354
He also said if you see that girl Hae Joo again,

521
00:34:02.955 --> 00:34:05.154
it'll be bad for her father.

522
00:34:11.064 --> 00:34:12.194
Jin.

523
00:34:18.475 --> 00:34:19.504
Jung Hee.

524
00:34:21.245 --> 00:34:24.015
Are you here to see Hae Joo?

525
00:34:24.814 --> 00:34:25.915
What?

526
00:34:25.915 --> 00:34:27.814
I'll get her.

527
00:34:36.895 --> 00:34:38.855
- Jung Hee. - Yes?

528
00:34:39.524 --> 00:34:40.665
Do you want...

529
00:34:41.895 --> 00:34:43.094
to watch a movie?

530
00:34:47.665 --> 00:34:48.864
Can you...

531
00:34:50.435 --> 00:34:52.875
just stay with me?

532
00:34:56.305 --> 00:35:00.114
I'm sure Jin came to see Hae Joo.

533
00:35:01.444 --> 00:35:04.015
I'm sure I'm an excuse.

534
00:35:05.154 --> 00:35:06.314
But...

535
00:35:12.995 --> 00:35:14.024
Sorry.

536
00:35:16.835 --> 00:35:17.964
I'll go.

537
00:35:26.274 --> 00:35:29.605
I know that, but I couldn't refuse...

538
00:35:30.314 --> 00:35:34.044
because he looked so sad.

539
00:35:39.314 --> 00:35:40.524
Why are you so late?

540
00:35:40.955 --> 00:35:44.625
Sorry. Can you smell my uniform for me?

541
00:35:48.825 --> 00:35:49.895
Where's Jung Hee?

542
00:35:50.495 --> 00:35:51.835
I thought she was back.

543
00:35:52.234 --> 00:35:53.335
Jung Hee?

544
00:35:53.665 --> 00:35:57.174
She was all excited about going on a date.

545
00:35:58.504 --> 00:36:00.004
A date?

546
00:36:00.145 --> 00:36:01.245
That's right.

547
00:36:02.174 --> 00:36:04.415
With Jin?

548
00:36:04.475 --> 00:36:05.515
That's right.

549
00:36:05.515 --> 00:36:09.044
They took the bus and went far, far away.

550
00:36:09.044 --> 00:36:10.754
They're very meticulous.

551
00:36:10.785 --> 00:36:11.915
Meticulous?

552
00:36:15.085 --> 00:36:18.024
Don't you worry. You have me.

553
00:36:24.995 --> 00:36:28.105
I've always dreamed of this moment.

554
00:36:29.234 --> 00:36:32.305
Sitting next to Jin at a theater...

555
00:36:32.605 --> 00:36:34.105
and watching a movie.

556
00:36:35.875 --> 00:36:39.844
My dream came true, but I'm not happy at all.

557
00:36:41.484 --> 00:36:45.214
It isn't because I am Hae Joo's fill-in.

558
00:36:46.254 --> 00:36:49.024
It's because Jin seems so sad,

559
00:36:49.524 --> 00:36:52.825
but there's nothing I can do to comfort him.

560
00:36:58.895 --> 00:37:00.035
Father?

561
00:37:04.475 --> 00:37:05.504
What's wrong?

562
00:37:08.205 --> 00:37:10.075
Father? Watching a movie?

563
00:37:11.044 --> 00:37:12.245
That's odd.

564
00:37:15.714 --> 00:37:17.585
- My father. - Father?

565
00:37:17.585 --> 00:37:19.814
- My father. - Let's go.

566
00:37:31.665 --> 00:37:33.864
I'm sorry, Jin.

567
00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:35.864
It's okay.

568
00:37:36.335 --> 00:37:38.335
You'll get in trouble if your father sees you.

569
00:37:41.705 --> 00:37:42.805
Let's go eat.

570
00:37:43.745 --> 00:37:45.114
How about dumplings?

571
00:37:46.174 --> 00:37:47.214
Sounds good.

572
00:37:52.455 --> 00:37:55.055
What? Auntie?

573
00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:57.625
Let's go.

574
00:37:59.794 --> 00:38:00.924
Okay.

575
00:38:05.335 --> 00:38:07.435
Maybe I was mistaken.

576
00:38:08.335 --> 00:38:10.335
2, 4.

577
00:38:13.774 --> 00:38:16.975
We're so busy. Why is it so busy today?

578
00:38:16.975 --> 00:38:19.975
I couldn't even pee today.

579
00:38:22.685 --> 00:38:23.714
Hey.

580
00:38:24.185 --> 00:38:27.154
Did Auntie say when she'd be back?

581
00:38:27.424 --> 00:38:29.625
She's delivering products to Hyangcheon-dong Market,

582
00:38:29.754 --> 00:38:31.995
and visiting a relative who lives there.

583
00:38:32.125 --> 00:38:33.254
Okay.

584
00:38:34.364 --> 00:38:36.765
Auntie had a relative...

585
00:38:36.835 --> 00:38:38.564
in Hyangcheon-dong?

586
00:38:47.344 --> 00:38:48.904
We're friends, right?

587
00:38:49.075 --> 00:38:50.774
Yes, of course.

588
00:38:51.575 --> 00:38:54.484
I can't see you anymore.

589
00:38:54.714 --> 00:38:56.344
I came to tell you that.

590
00:38:57.055 --> 00:38:58.814
We have to break up now.

591
00:38:59.484 --> 00:39:00.855
I mean it.

592
00:39:01.055 --> 00:39:03.955
I don't think we are a suitable pair.

593
00:39:09.125 --> 00:39:11.765
Smile, Yang Ja. Keep your promise.

594
00:39:12.134 --> 00:39:13.165
Earlier...

595
00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:27.314
Why aren't you eating?

596
00:39:28.585 --> 00:39:29.915
Don't you like dumplings?

597
00:39:30.154 --> 00:39:32.285
Yes, I do.

598
00:39:32.585 --> 00:39:35.185
Eat up. This place is famous.

599
00:39:35.855 --> 00:39:36.855
Okay.

600
00:39:43.835 --> 00:39:44.964
It's strange.

601
00:39:45.395 --> 00:39:47.265
Why does it taste so bad?

602
00:39:48.234 --> 00:39:49.404
Jung Hee.

603
00:39:49.805 --> 00:39:51.975
She ate so well when she came with me.

604
00:39:52.004 --> 00:39:55.274
What? Is she acting coy in front of Jin?

605
00:39:58.714 --> 00:39:59.875
Dong Moon?

606
00:40:07.825 --> 00:40:08.955
Dong Moon again?

607
00:40:14.694 --> 00:40:15.694
That's right.

608
00:40:16.194 --> 00:40:17.294
Dong Moon.

609
00:40:18.165 --> 00:40:19.667
You're always out playing.

610
00:40:19.692 --> 00:40:20.789
When do you study?

611
00:40:21.105 --> 00:40:23.064
I heard you came in first in your grade again.

612
00:40:23.575 --> 00:40:24.875
First in his entire grade?

613
00:40:25.274 --> 00:40:26.404
For real?

614
00:40:26.904 --> 00:40:30.544
You're much smarter than you look.

615
00:40:31.075 --> 00:40:32.075
Well...

616
00:40:43.185 --> 00:40:44.225
You two eat.

617
00:40:44.825 --> 00:40:45.825
I'll go first.

618
00:40:47.524 --> 00:40:48.524
But...

619
00:40:49.094 --> 00:40:50.335
Bye.

620
00:40:52.094 --> 00:40:53.094
What...

621
00:40:58.174 --> 00:40:59.205
Jung Hee.

622
00:41:08.544 --> 00:41:09.544
What?

623
00:41:10.884 --> 00:41:13.314
I wanted to say bye.

624
00:41:14.325 --> 00:41:17.194
Thank you for taking me...

625
00:41:17.895 --> 00:41:19.125
to the movie.

626
00:41:25.835 --> 00:41:27.665
- Jung Hee. - Yes?

627
00:41:28.035 --> 00:41:29.134
I was sorry...

628
00:41:30.335 --> 00:41:31.774
for many things.

629
00:41:32.935 --> 00:41:34.375
You're a good kid.

630
00:41:35.844 --> 00:41:36.875
You're kind...

631
00:41:37.875 --> 00:41:38.975
and cute.

632
00:41:46.254 --> 00:41:47.254
Bye.

633
00:42:18.654 --> 00:42:20.325
You're leaving?

634
00:42:21.254 --> 00:42:24.055
Yes. I found a job near my parents' home.

635
00:42:25.754 --> 00:42:27.325
- Also... - Also what?

636
00:42:28.864 --> 00:42:30.694
I can't do this...

637
00:42:34.435 --> 00:42:35.435
Do Ha.

638
00:42:36.435 --> 00:42:37.535
Must you go?

639
00:42:37.535 --> 00:42:38.774
I'm sorry.

640
00:42:43.944 --> 00:42:45.645
Aren't you Jung Hee's Auntie?

641
00:42:45.774 --> 00:42:46.785
Auntie...

642
00:42:51.415 --> 00:42:53.154
Jung Hee's father.

643
00:43:03.064 --> 00:43:04.564
Stop following me.

644
00:43:05.564 --> 00:43:07.035
I'm not following you.

645
00:43:07.064 --> 00:43:08.335
I'm walking you home.

646
00:43:08.864 --> 00:43:10.734
It's dangerous at night.

647
00:43:11.174 --> 00:43:12.375
Leave.

648
00:43:12.805 --> 00:43:13.975
I'm home now.

649
00:43:14.475 --> 00:43:16.075
Was I that wrong?

650
00:43:20.384 --> 00:43:23.285
- What? - Is it my fault that...

651
00:43:24.455 --> 00:43:26.085
I was there when you were on a date?

652
00:43:26.154 --> 00:43:27.555
It wasn't a date.

653
00:43:29.524 --> 00:43:30.654
At least you know.

654
00:43:33.424 --> 00:43:34.424
Hey.

655
00:43:35.395 --> 00:43:36.464
Don't you...

656
00:43:37.435 --> 00:43:39.064
follow me anymore.

657
00:43:39.364 --> 00:43:40.765
It's annoying.

658
00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:46.174
I'm annoying?

659
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:48.404
I'm also...

660
00:43:49.774 --> 00:43:53.114
sick of following you like a puppy dog...

661
00:43:53.114 --> 00:43:54.314
when you don't even look at me.

662
00:43:56.444 --> 00:43:57.555
I'll stop.

663
00:43:58.785 --> 00:44:00.654
I won't follow you around anymore.

664
00:44:01.484 --> 00:44:02.484
Sorry...

665
00:44:03.495 --> 00:44:04.694
for annoying you.

666
00:44:22.245 --> 00:44:23.614
You brat.

667
00:44:23.975 --> 00:44:26.444
Where were you this late at night?

668
00:44:27.185 --> 00:44:29.685
Why is your skirt so short?

669
00:44:29.745 --> 00:44:31.285
Maybe I grew.

670
00:44:32.384 --> 00:44:33.855
I was at Eun Ja's house.

671
00:44:36.955 --> 00:44:38.194
Madam.

672
00:44:38.754 --> 00:44:40.024
I'm sorry I'm late.

673
00:44:40.024 --> 00:44:41.524
No need to be sorry.

674
00:44:41.524 --> 00:44:43.665
You need time off too.

675
00:44:44.194 --> 00:44:46.495
I should be doing that.

676
00:44:46.495 --> 00:44:48.004
I'll change and come out.

677
00:44:48.004 --> 00:44:49.004
Auntie.

678
00:44:50.174 --> 00:44:52.205
- What? - Today, at Hyangcheon...

679
00:44:56.404 --> 00:44:57.415
Never mind.

680
00:44:58.875 --> 00:45:00.714
Mom, Father was...

681
00:45:06.384 --> 00:45:07.384
Never mind.

682
00:45:08.285 --> 00:45:10.654
Punk. What about your father?

683
00:45:10.654 --> 00:45:11.654
Nothing.

684
00:45:11.654 --> 00:45:13.825
What? What did he do?

685
00:45:16.424 --> 00:45:17.535
Go rest.

686
00:45:18.964 --> 00:45:19.964
Okay.

687
00:45:21.935 --> 00:45:23.035
I couldn't tell Mom...

688
00:45:23.234 --> 00:45:25.674
that I saw Father in the theater...

689
00:45:28.774 --> 00:45:31.714
or that I saw Auntie...

690
00:45:33.314 --> 00:45:35.444
in front of the theater.

691
00:45:39.384 --> 00:45:41.585
Because she can't know that I went...

692
00:45:41.585 --> 00:45:43.125
to that theater.

693
00:45:46.154 --> 00:45:48.125
No. It was more because...

694
00:45:50.294 --> 00:45:51.495
It was more because...

695
00:46:06.214 --> 00:46:08.245
My instincts told me...

696
00:46:08.714 --> 00:46:11.754
there was a bigger reason why I shouldn't say...

697
00:46:12.484 --> 00:46:14.455
I was in Hyangcheon-dong.

698
00:46:19.524 --> 00:46:21.524
Dangerous instincts.

699
00:46:23.064 --> 00:46:24.165
Where are we going?

700
00:46:24.165 --> 00:46:26.734
I told you. I need to tell you something.

701
00:46:26.734 --> 00:46:28.605
- Let go. - Come here.

702
00:46:28.605 --> 00:46:29.935
Stop it.

703
00:46:29.935 --> 00:46:32.035
Don't be like that. Just have one drink.

704
00:46:32.035 --> 00:46:34.475
Let go already.

705
00:46:35.245 --> 00:46:37.245
That brat.

706
00:46:37.614 --> 00:46:39.745
Get over here. Come on.

707
00:46:39.745 --> 00:46:41.314
Come here.

708
00:46:41.314 --> 00:46:43.714
- Just one drink. - Stop it. Let go.

709
00:46:48.484 --> 00:46:50.294
Hey, Young Choon.

710
00:46:50.924 --> 00:46:52.725
Didn't you switch from Ae Sook...

711
00:46:53.225 --> 00:46:54.364
to the communist?

712
00:46:54.964 --> 00:46:57.335
- Communist? - That's right. Communist.

713
00:46:58.064 --> 00:47:00.435
Communist?

714
00:47:00.435 --> 00:47:03.205
- Stop it. Young Choon. - You want to die?

715
00:47:03.205 --> 00:47:05.105
Stop it already.

716
00:47:05.105 --> 00:47:08.305
What if you end up back in the slammer?

717
00:47:08.674 --> 00:47:10.274
Stop it.

718
00:47:17.884 --> 00:47:19.915
This is nice.

719
00:47:20.424 --> 00:47:22.685
The night air is sweet.

720
00:47:23.694 --> 00:47:26.325
- Let go. - I don't want to.

721
00:47:26.995 --> 00:47:28.024
Do you want to walk?

722
00:47:35.335 --> 00:47:36.634
Young Choon.

723
00:47:38.705 --> 00:47:41.344
You like Hae Joo, don't you?

724
00:47:43.274 --> 00:47:45.274
There's a bad rumor about her.

725
00:47:45.645 --> 00:47:47.085
There's a bad rumor about you too.

726
00:47:48.585 --> 00:47:49.645
Same for me.

727
00:47:49.645 --> 00:47:52.585
I don't care about that.

728
00:47:54.085 --> 00:47:55.884
As long as you...

729
00:47:56.555 --> 00:47:58.225
like me...

730
00:48:02.625 --> 00:48:03.634
Walk home.

731
00:48:37.864 --> 00:48:39.064
Mister.

732
00:48:39.265 --> 00:48:40.535
Why are you out here?

733
00:48:41.765 --> 00:48:42.935
Is something wrong?

734
00:48:42.935 --> 00:48:45.475
Just. I wanted some air.

735
00:48:46.375 --> 00:48:47.875
I thought I'd take a walk.

736
00:48:54.145 --> 00:48:55.145
Okay, then.

737
00:48:58.214 --> 00:48:59.314
If you want some air,

738
00:49:01.384 --> 00:49:02.685
how about a ride?

739
00:49:29.944 --> 00:49:31.254
Hold on tight.

740
00:49:31.855 --> 00:49:32.884
You'll get hurt.

741
00:49:46.035 --> 00:49:47.105
Hold on tight.

742
00:49:47.765 --> 00:49:48.765
I'm going to speed up.

743
00:50:04.754 --> 00:50:06.114
I don't care either.

744
00:50:07.154 --> 00:50:08.484
As long as...

745
00:50:09.225 --> 00:50:11.325
I can look at you without anyone's knowing,

746
00:50:12.455 --> 00:50:13.625
it doesn't matter.

747
00:50:35.314 --> 00:50:38.415
I was sorry for many things.

748
00:50:41.855 --> 00:50:43.254
Jin.

749
00:50:44.424 --> 00:50:46.355
Is something wrong?

750
00:51:06.614 --> 00:51:09.844
What the... Why did Dong Moon show up?

751
00:51:10.984 --> 00:51:12.515
Get lost, Dong Moon.

752
00:51:32.835 --> 00:51:34.245
What the...

753
00:51:40.145 --> 00:51:41.515
Dong Moon...

754
00:51:42.415 --> 00:51:44.455
seemed really hurt.

755
00:51:52.395 --> 00:51:54.424
Hello, Mr. Bae.

756
00:51:54.564 --> 00:51:57.935
Thank you for coming even on a Sunday.

757
00:51:58.995 --> 00:52:01.504
But... Are you going out?

758
00:52:02.904 --> 00:52:06.134
I'm going to a gathering, sir.

759
00:52:06.475 --> 00:52:08.745
Please, there's no need to be so formal.

760
00:52:08.745 --> 00:52:09.844
Yes, there is.

761
00:52:10.075 --> 00:52:13.415
You work so hard to teach our two birdbrains.

762
00:52:13.484 --> 00:52:15.984
I must be formal and respectful.

763
00:52:16.544 --> 00:52:17.785
Mom, are you going...

764
00:52:19.685 --> 00:52:22.125
You're not going like that, are you?

765
00:52:23.825 --> 00:52:25.424
Why? Is it weird?

766
00:52:25.594 --> 00:52:28.564
It's crazy weird. You'll make people sick.

767
00:52:30.294 --> 00:52:31.564
You punk.

768
00:52:33.294 --> 00:52:37.205
You punk. Listen to your teacher,

769
00:52:37.205 --> 00:52:39.205
and study hard. Got it?

770
00:52:39.734 --> 00:52:42.605
Jung Hee! Your teacher's here!

771
00:52:42.975 --> 00:52:44.044
Jung Hee!

772
00:52:46.814 --> 00:52:48.814
- I'm not deaf. - Gibberish.

773
00:52:49.944 --> 00:52:51.214
I'll go now.

774
00:52:56.654 --> 00:52:58.194
Mom, you should...

775
00:52:58.924 --> 00:53:00.125
Gibberish.

776
00:53:03.794 --> 00:53:06.535
- Hello. - Hello.

777
00:53:07.904 --> 00:53:10.835
- Jung Hee's dad? - I saw with my own eyes.

778
00:53:11.705 --> 00:53:12.975
Gibberish.

779
00:53:13.274 --> 00:53:15.344
Why are we meeting here and wasting money?

780
00:53:15.344 --> 00:53:17.174
We could've just met in our neighborhood.

781
00:53:23.754 --> 00:53:25.154
Were you badmouthing me again?

782
00:53:25.384 --> 00:53:27.055
That I have a bad temper.

783
00:53:27.484 --> 00:53:29.024
Go ahead, keep going.

784
00:53:29.524 --> 00:53:32.955
It's not like you're cutting me open.

785
00:53:33.225 --> 00:53:36.495
It doesn't hurt me, so go right ahead.

786
00:53:38.964 --> 00:53:40.864
How could you say that?

787
00:54:06.725 --> 00:54:07.725
What?

788
00:54:11.794 --> 00:54:12.895
Didn't you tell her?

789
00:54:13.364 --> 00:54:15.734
About what? Oh, that?

790
00:54:15.765 --> 00:54:17.734
No, not yet.

791
00:54:18.975 --> 00:54:20.004
About what?

792
00:54:21.975 --> 00:54:24.614
- What is it? - About... You know, Jin.

793
00:54:24.614 --> 00:54:26.984
Jin is transferring to a school in Seoul.

794
00:54:32.214 --> 00:54:34.424
He's leaving today, right?

795
00:54:35.455 --> 00:54:37.625
Since Jin's father...

796
00:54:37.754 --> 00:54:39.254
is loaded,

797
00:54:39.424 --> 00:54:41.864
he processed the transfer in like a day.

798
00:54:45.134 --> 00:54:47.605
When will we ever solve all of these?

799
00:54:54.805 --> 00:54:55.904
Jung Hee.

800
00:54:56.375 --> 00:54:58.515
I'm going to get my workbook.

801
00:55:03.884 --> 00:55:05.185
Okay, okay.

802
00:55:11.094 --> 00:55:12.194
He's leaving?

803
00:55:13.725 --> 00:55:15.094
He's leaving like this?

804
00:55:19.694 --> 00:55:20.864
Then, was that...

805
00:55:22.564 --> 00:55:24.174
the last time?

806
00:55:32.075 --> 00:55:33.645
Go if he wants. Whatever.

807
00:55:47.165 --> 00:55:48.325
Here.

808
00:55:49.294 --> 00:55:51.064
- Take this with you. - What about you?

809
00:55:51.495 --> 00:55:52.634
I'm fine.

810
00:55:55.064 --> 00:55:56.634
This isn't right.

811
00:56:10.415 --> 00:56:11.515
You're brave.

812
00:56:12.114 --> 00:56:13.214
Are you hurt?

813
00:56:16.384 --> 00:56:17.725
You almost fell again.

814
00:56:18.555 --> 00:56:19.955
This isn't right.

815
00:56:21.325 --> 00:56:23.794
Even if I meant nothing...

816
00:56:24.094 --> 00:56:25.864
to Jin,

817
00:56:27.665 --> 00:56:29.064
this isn't right.

818
00:56:31.605 --> 00:56:32.875
Seoul, please.

819
00:56:53.294 --> 00:56:54.395
Jung Hee.

820
00:56:55.964 --> 00:56:57.064
Jung Hee!

821
00:57:08.444 --> 00:57:09.504
Get on.

822
00:57:11.015 --> 00:57:14.185
You can't see Jin if you run there.

823
00:57:15.544 --> 00:57:16.955
Get on. Hurry.

824
00:57:33.035 --> 00:57:34.734
(Bus Schedule)

825
00:58:06.964 --> 00:58:09.364
That's it. That's his bus.

826
00:58:19.174 --> 00:58:20.344
Jin!

827
00:58:20.544 --> 00:58:21.844
Jin!
