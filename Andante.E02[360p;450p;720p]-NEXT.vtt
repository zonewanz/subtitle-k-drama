<i>[Episode 2: Birth of Bernard]</i>

2
00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:34.478
Dad, I want to go up there.

3
00:01:34.478 --> 00:01:37.380
Help me up. Help me up.

4
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.649
That's too high for you, Bom.

5
00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.954
No, no. I'm going to go up there.

6
00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:45.555
Help me up there.

7
00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:47.557
Fine, but only once.

8
00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:48.725
Yeah!

9
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.696
<i>Fine, but only once.</i>

10
00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:57.601
<i>Dad is sick now,
so it's hard to hold you, Bom.</i>

11
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:07.277
<i>[Congratulations on your birthday.
Here is a coupon for your birthday.]</i>

<i>[Customer Kim Bom]</i>

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.647
<i>[30 percent off on your birthday.]</i>

<i>[Mom]</i>

15
00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:53.323
Hello.

16
00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:54.925
<i>Since when do you pick up your phone?</i>

17
00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.460
Why did you call?

18
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.964
You're going to receive
a package today, so stay home.

19
00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:03.300
What package?

20
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.602
I packed up all your stuff
here and sent it.

21
00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.305
<i>I told you to take it ages ago.</i>

22
00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:11.641
But I know you don't like
it when I come by.

23
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:13.910
Can't you come when
the family isn't here?

24
00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:16.813
<i>Anyway, I sent it all</i>

25
00:03:16.813 --> 00:03:17.948
so just be there.

26
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:13.029
<i>Whether it's Seoul or here...</i>

27
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:17.367
<i>all the girls in Korea
look the same from behind.</i>

28
00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:21.638
<i>Long hair, school uniform,
and short skirts.</i>

29
00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:25.742
<i>They even look similar
from the side and the front.</i>

30
00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:29.079
<i>They're either looking at their phones,
taking selfies, or gossiping.</i>

31
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.339
<i>Ah, it's the corpse girl.</i>

32
00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:04.647
<i>There is a girl in Korea
who is different from all the others.</i>

33
00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:22.532
Hey! Get up already.

34
00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:01.671
Hey, this isn't the school.

35
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.407
This is the place we passed last night.

36
00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:08.411
Well, she was getting off.

37
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:12.482
Everyone stayed on and one person
got off, yet you followed the one girl?

38
00:07:12.482 --> 00:07:14.083
She was in a uniform!

39
00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:16.853
Wow, seriously everything you do is...

40
00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.655
You were sleeping with your mouth open.

41
00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:20.123
You find your own way then!

42
00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:22.492
I couldn't sleep at all because
Grandma was snoring, okay?

43
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:28.598
Hey, should we just change
our plans and not go to school?

44
00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:35.138
What's going on? Do you need help?

45
00:07:38.174 --> 00:07:40.510
Ah, my name is Park Ga Ram.

46
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.979
I saw you guys yesterday
during the funeral rites.

47
00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:45.248
Oh, you were there.

48
00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:48.384
Yes, it was Min Suk's grandmother's
funeral. He's in our class.

49
00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:49.652
Everyone was there.

50
00:07:49.652 --> 00:07:53.022
I heard you two are staying
with Grandma Duk Boon.

51
00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:55.391
My father works at the hospice.

52
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:56.392
So?

53
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.862
Aren't you on your way to school?

54
00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:01.731
Yes, Gaon High School.

55
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:02.966
Then, what are you doing here?

56
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.535
It's a pretty long walk.

57
00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:10.773
I can give one of you a ride.

58
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.346
Ah... give Shi Young a ride.

59
00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:18.781
- I'll run there.
- You...

60
00:08:19.282 --> 00:08:20.850
I'll run.

61
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.185
Fine, you do that.

62
00:08:32.462 --> 00:08:33.530
Will you be okay?

63
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.265
Hurry up and go.

64
00:08:44.374 --> 00:08:45.942
Hey, Lee Shi Kyung!

65
00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.143
Where are you going?

66
00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:52.749
<i>For me, school is a place
I can start attending tomorrow. </i>

67
00:08:52.749 --> 00:08:53.783
<i>As usual...</i>

68
00:09:00.823 --> 00:09:02.892
Yes, this is it.

69
00:09:02.892 --> 00:09:05.628
It wouldn't be Korea
without an internet cafe.

70
00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:07.997
Where is it?

71
00:09:07.997 --> 00:09:10.033
Excuse me, young man.

72
00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.503
Do you live in this neighborhood?

73
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.471
No.

74
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:17.473
I mean... yes.

75
00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:19.542
It's complicated.

76
00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:23.813
Sorry to ask you since we've just met,
but can I ask you a favor?

77
00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.181
A favor?

78
00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.884
You know that hospice?

79
00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:34.857
Can you deliver it to this patient?

80
00:09:34.857 --> 00:09:37.927
You can go yourself, or send
her a message on the phone.

81
00:09:38.928 --> 00:09:40.697
She won't respond to any of my messages.

82
00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:44.567
She refuses to meet me and
won't let me near her room.

83
00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:56.679
She's a patient with big eyes
and a pretty smile.

84
00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:57.780
Please do me this favor.

85
00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:06.022
Where's the internet cafe?

86
00:10:25.742 --> 00:10:26.909
Put that down.

87
00:10:26.909 --> 00:10:28.878
Hey, don't do it.

88
00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.079
Give it to me.

89
00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:31.848
- You can't.
- Hey, seriously.

90
00:10:31.848 --> 00:10:33.716
Hey, give it back.

91
00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:36.085
Are you really going to be like this?

92
00:10:40.123 --> 00:10:41.424
Attention, everyone.

93
00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:47.196
We have two students transferring
into our class from Seoul.

94
00:10:47.196 --> 00:10:49.632
Wow! Seoul.

95
00:10:49.632 --> 00:10:52.368
Goodness, don't act like
such small-town people.

96
00:10:52.368 --> 00:10:53.403
Be quiet, now.

97
00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:54.904
Lee Shi Young.

98
00:10:58.474 --> 00:10:59.475
That's it?

99
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.947
They are your new classmates.
You should say a few words.

100
00:11:04.947 --> 00:11:08.051
My name is Lee Shi Young.
This is my first time transferring.

101
00:11:08.051 --> 00:11:10.386
I won't say fake things like,
"Let's all get along."

102
00:11:10.386 --> 00:11:12.488
We'll get used to each other over time.

103
00:11:12.488 --> 00:11:14.524
Oh, don't ask me for my phone number.

104
00:11:14.524 --> 00:11:15.591
I don't have a phone.

105
00:11:16.793 --> 00:11:18.761
She's a great speaker.

106
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:20.329
She has charisma.

107
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:23.566
Shi Young doesn't have a phone.
She says she has no phone.

108
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.636
Let's all get along.

109
00:11:26.636 --> 00:11:27.704
Okay.

110
00:11:28.838 --> 00:11:31.474
Shi Young, you can sit beside Ji Ae.

111
00:11:38.081 --> 00:11:40.616
Why isn't the other
transfer student here?

112
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:43.953
Is 3rd and 4th period
the death experience?

113
00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.555
Yes.

114
00:11:45.555 --> 00:11:47.623
We should all go together.

115
00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:50.526
Shi Young, why don't you go
take your funeral portrait now?

116
00:11:50.526 --> 00:11:51.594
What?

117
00:12:00.336 --> 00:12:01.604
What is the death experience?

118
00:12:01.604 --> 00:12:03.172
Oh, that.

119
00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:07.410
It's just like it sounds. You experience
death by lying in a coffin.

120
00:12:08.244 --> 00:12:10.646
You want me to die
as soon as I transfer here?

121
00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:15.618
It's a character program. It's unique.

122
00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:16.953
It only exists at this school.

123
00:12:16.953 --> 00:12:18.354
Why do you do things like that?

124
00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.924
It's weird at first.

125
00:12:21.924 --> 00:12:25.928
When you keep dying,
suddenly something comes to you.

126
00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:28.264
What comes to you?

127
00:12:28.264 --> 00:12:30.399
Something does come.
You'll feel it later.

128
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.802
You'll get used to it soon.

129
00:12:32.802 --> 00:12:34.971
The atmosphere here is
"to die for" and unique.

130
00:12:34.971 --> 00:12:36.939
I don't want to get used to it.

131
00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:39.375
Do you know where to go
for your funeral portrait?

132
00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:40.910
I'll take you there.

133
00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.727
Ah... I'm hungry.

134
00:13:04.934 --> 00:13:06.936
I don't know how many years it has been.

135
00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:09.105
Places like this don't change much.

136
00:13:09.105 --> 00:13:11.507
It may seem like it hasn't,
but it has changed.

137
00:13:11.507 --> 00:13:13.476
There's even a hospice now.

138
00:13:13.476 --> 00:13:15.845
There must be a job
as a nurse at the hospice.

139
00:13:15.845 --> 00:13:17.346
You probably need a license.

140
00:13:18.848 --> 00:13:20.449
You want me to do a job like that?

141
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:22.451
There's nothing for you to do here.

142
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:25.621
You graduated with an art degree
and have a license in art therapy.

143
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:27.056
That doesn't help at all.

144
00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.425
It has never helped me out.

145
00:13:30.793 --> 00:13:34.096
What about you?
Get a contract position as a lecturer.

146
00:13:34.096 --> 00:13:37.133
I wish I could too.
Don't say any more about that.

147
00:13:39.202 --> 00:13:40.670
This looks so good.

148
00:13:48.678 --> 00:13:49.712
Get out.

149
00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.648
- Mom!
- Get out.

150
00:13:52.648 --> 00:13:55.184
Shi Kyung, what are you doing here?

151
00:13:55.184 --> 00:13:57.520
Why are you not in school?

152
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.723
You're going to the
internet cafe, aren't you?

153
00:14:00.723 --> 00:14:02.325
No, it's not that.

154
00:14:02.325 --> 00:14:04.794
Ah, I had some mail from Seoul.

155
00:14:05.361 --> 00:14:06.829
I was on my way to school just now.

156
00:14:07.363 --> 00:14:09.298
My bag... I'll go get my bag.

157
00:14:10.366 --> 00:14:12.835
Hey, you better come back out right away.

158
00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:14.303
Seriously, that kid.

159
00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:17.840
I'm so damn unlucky.

160
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:27.683
I'm going to school right now, okay?

161
00:14:27.683 --> 00:14:30.853
Why are you here though?
You left with Shi Young.

162
00:14:30.853 --> 00:14:32.922
It's your first day.
You should be at school now.

163
00:14:32.922 --> 00:14:34.991
Why are you at an internet cafe? Why?

164
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.494
Well, to play games...

165
00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:42.465
Nice answer you have there.
Nice answer!

166
00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:43.866
- Really?
- That hurts.

167
00:14:44.834 --> 00:14:46.569
I have to go to school.

168
00:14:46.569 --> 00:14:48.137
Are you going to do this here too?

169
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:50.172
Are you not going
to get your act together?

170
00:14:50.172 --> 00:14:52.275
Sis, just send him to school for now.

171
00:14:52.275 --> 00:14:53.509
Right, Aunt?

172
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:55.511
How do I get to school?

173
00:14:56.212 --> 00:14:57.713
Are you going to school?

174
00:14:59.949 --> 00:15:02.852
It sounds like you need to get to school.

175
00:15:02.852 --> 00:15:04.787
I can give you a ride.

176
00:15:04.787 --> 00:15:07.356
Who are you?

177
00:15:07.356 --> 00:15:08.958
Thank you. I'll go.

178
00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.626
Hey!

179
00:15:10.626 --> 00:15:13.763
I'm the vice-principal
of Gaon High School.

180
00:15:13.763 --> 00:15:16.532
I stepped out and was on
my way back to school.

181
00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:17.934
Please don't worry.

182
00:15:17.934 --> 00:15:22.505
That student was at an internet cafe
and is on his way back to school.

183
00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:23.973
We can head back together.

184
00:15:24.874 --> 00:15:26.475
Ah... yes.

185
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.478
Yes, let's meet again soon.

186
00:15:29.478 --> 00:15:30.546
Okay.

187
00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:36.819
Gosh, that kid.

188
00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.628
I don't think I've seen you
at school before.

189
00:15:45.628 --> 00:15:47.463
Yes, I just transferred.

190
00:15:47.463 --> 00:15:49.565
Oh, the siblings from Seoul.

191
00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:51.033
How did you know that?

192
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.235
There are only two classes per grade.

193
00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:55.338
I can't help but know the students.

194
00:15:56.238 --> 00:15:57.974
You're curious about who I am, right?

195
00:15:58.741 --> 00:16:01.610
I'm not going to tell you.

196
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.913
<i>I'm not curious.</i>

197
00:16:03.913 --> 00:16:05.915
<i>I never asked you.</i>

198
00:16:05.915 --> 00:16:08.284
This place is very different
from Seoul, isn't it?

199
00:16:08.284 --> 00:16:09.352
What do you think?

200
00:16:09.352 --> 00:16:10.886
I don't know.

201
00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:12.888
Well...

202
00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:14.957
Oh, I saw a funeral procession.

203
00:16:15.825 --> 00:16:18.627
Yesterday, they had a funeral procession
for Min Suk's grandmother.

204
00:16:19.595 --> 00:16:21.931
- Was that your first time seeing one?
- Yes.

205
00:16:22.832 --> 00:16:25.634
The neighborhood seems a little strange.

206
00:16:25.634 --> 00:16:29.672
A funeral procession,
hospice, and even coffins.

207
00:16:29.672 --> 00:16:31.640
You're right. This place...

208
00:16:32.842 --> 00:16:34.076
is "to die for."

209
00:16:34.944 --> 00:16:37.079
- Excuse me?
- You'll understand once you live here

210
00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:39.215
just how much this place is "to die for."

211
00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:43.652
The juniors should be in the
death experience class now.

212
00:16:43.652 --> 00:16:45.654
You better go to the hospice.

213
00:16:45.654 --> 00:16:46.822
Death experience?

214
00:16:46.822 --> 00:16:48.524
What is that?

215
00:16:48.524 --> 00:16:52.395
Lying inside... a coffin.

216
00:16:52.395 --> 00:16:53.896
A coffin?

217
00:16:54.063 --> 00:16:55.498
"Dad."

218
00:16:56.198 --> 00:16:58.367
"Life is like looking down
from the skies."

219
00:16:58.367 --> 00:17:02.605
"It's like a breeze that looks
upon a still sleep."

220
00:17:03.572 --> 00:17:04.573
"Goodbye."

221
00:17:05.307 --> 00:17:08.377
"My dad, whom I long for
again and again."

222
00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:18.788
Just like this poem,
think of someone you long for.

223
00:17:20.756 --> 00:17:26.195
Call out to that person in your heart.

224
00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:29.732
Parents.

225
00:17:30.566 --> 00:17:31.634
Friends.

226
00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.536
- Grandma.
- Lastly...

227
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.840
someone you wish to see
just one more time.

228
00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:44.480
Say goodbye to those people
for the last time.

229
00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:46.816
What was your life like?

230
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.654
Let them hear about it.

231
00:17:55.024 --> 00:17:56.025
<i>Dad.</i>

232
00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.895
<i>My life... my life was...</i>

233
00:17:59.895 --> 00:18:01.764
It is time to go now.

234
00:18:01.764 --> 00:18:05.201
The coffin will be closed.

235
00:18:05.201 --> 00:18:09.772
While in the coffin,
think about your tombstone inscription.

236
00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.575
Ponder that.

237
00:18:44.773 --> 00:18:47.009
Min Suk, you cried.

238
00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:49.111
Yes, I was thinking about my grandmother.

239
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:51.780
Why do I feel so comfortable
and good inside a coffin?

240
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.948
Coffins must suit me.

241
00:18:52.948 --> 00:18:55.551
We're supposed to gather
in front of the hospice now.

242
00:18:57.286 --> 00:18:59.788
How was it? It was strange, right?

243
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.959
It was really weird, at first.

244
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.429
In the middle of it,
something came to me like you said.

245
00:19:07.429 --> 00:19:09.331
I was a little moved.

246
00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:12.902
It was when the teacher said
"to think of someone I long for."

247
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.039
Still, it was weird.

248
00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.807
Is there anything else like this here?

249
00:19:18.807 --> 00:19:23.012
Hm, tombstone inscription, volunteering
at the hospice, and that's it.

250
00:19:23.012 --> 00:19:24.880
What's with all of that? So dark.

251
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.017
Why isn't your older brother here?

252
00:19:28.017 --> 00:19:29.919
Did he get lost or something?

253
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.488
Lee Shi Kyung? He isn't coming.
Don't worry about him.

254
00:19:33.055 --> 00:19:34.990
Maybe he went to school.

255
00:19:35.558 --> 00:19:38.127
School? Lee Shi Kyung?

256
00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.536
There's a death experience room
on the second floor.

257
00:19:47.536 --> 00:19:49.672
- You can go there.
- Okay.

258
00:19:49.672 --> 00:19:52.908
They only do this class once
in junior year.

259
00:19:52.908 --> 00:19:54.343
You should go even if you're late.

260
00:19:54.343 --> 00:19:57.446
<i>Gosh, I have already experienced
enough time in a coffin.</i>

261
00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:59.515
Who are you though, Lady?

262
00:19:59.515 --> 00:20:00.849
Lady?

263
00:20:00.849 --> 00:20:04.153
I'm the vice-principal.

264
00:20:04.153 --> 00:20:06.322
Don't skip classes too often.

265
00:20:18.867 --> 00:20:21.303
<i>[Gaon Hospice]</i>

266
00:20:23.672 --> 00:20:26.475
The letter! Oh no.

267
00:20:29.378 --> 00:20:30.512
Sorry.

268
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.051
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:37.886 --> 00:20:39.088
Hold on.

270
00:20:40.389 --> 00:20:41.690
Sorry, sorry.

271
00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:45.094
What happened to it?

272
00:20:47.196 --> 00:20:48.364
Where is it?

273
00:21:00.776 --> 00:21:01.877
Who threw it out?

274
00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:16.125
You're that student from last time.
What are you doing here?

275
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.261
- Are you okay now?
- Yes.

276
00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:23.465
Is there a patient named Lee Myung...
Lee Myung Joo?

277
00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:24.767
She has big eyes.

278
00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:26.902
She just passed away a while ago.

279
00:21:26.902 --> 00:21:29.038
- Why?
- She passed away?

280
00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:32.408
She's a lady with big eyes
and a pretty smile.

281
00:21:32.408 --> 00:21:33.942
- Is that her?
- Yes.

282
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.512
How do you know Lee Myung Joo anyway?

283
00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:45.754
<i>If only I had delivered
the letter right away...</i>

284
00:21:47.623 --> 00:21:49.491
Oh, this is the other transfer student.

285
00:21:50.326 --> 00:21:51.627
Lee Shi Kyung?

286
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:54.263
What are doing here?

287
00:21:54.263 --> 00:21:57.166
Ah, are you here to do
the death experience?

288
00:21:57.166 --> 00:22:01.070
Attention, I told you there was another
transfer student, Lee Shi Kyung.

289
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.005
- Hi.
- Hello.

290
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.042
Are you two siblings?

291
00:22:07.042 --> 00:22:08.677
No, I don't know him.

292
00:22:09.278 --> 00:22:10.512
Oh, really?

293
00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:17.653
Well, you've all met now.
Let's go back to school.

294
00:22:17.653 --> 00:22:19.254
You all hate being late for lunch.

295
00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:21.690
- Yeah!
- I'm so hungry.

296
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.559
- Hurry, hurry.
- What's for lunch?

297
00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:26.428
I'm so hungry!

298
00:22:27.696 --> 00:22:28.964
Will you help me?

299
00:22:38.073 --> 00:22:40.442
This is Lee Myung Joo's mortuary.

300
00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:44.279
There's almost no one here.

301
00:22:45.347 --> 00:22:46.448
Why do you need to be here?

302
00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.318
I thought I should, at least, do this.

303
00:23:00.829 --> 00:23:06.068
"Right now... I feel as if I am
pouring out all the blood in my body"

304
00:23:06.068 --> 00:23:08.036
"as I write this letter to you."

305
00:23:09.438 --> 00:23:12.374
"I am sorry to use a phrase
like this with you since you're ill."

306
00:23:13.208 --> 00:23:17.579
"But, I truly feel like I am
pouring out everything I have in me."

307
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.983
"Do you remember that film
we saw together?"

308
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:24.186
"A dead person met a live person."

309
00:23:25.954 --> 00:23:27.990
"A daughter aged faster than her father."

310
00:23:29.124 --> 00:23:32.361
"Time and space, life and death..."

311
00:23:33.228 --> 00:23:36.198
"There is a different world
than the one we know."

312
00:23:39.768 --> 00:23:41.036
"That is what I believe."

313
00:23:42.771 --> 00:23:44.973
"So, even if you leave this world"

314
00:23:44.973 --> 00:23:47.075
"I have decided to believe
you are not truly gone."

315
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:52.681
"So, do not say we do not have much time
left and shouldn't be together."

316
00:23:53.515 --> 00:23:57.753
"I... will marry you."

317
00:24:09.064 --> 00:24:13.168
"You don't have much time left,
and you foolishly use it to avoid me."

318
00:24:13.168 --> 00:24:16.638
"That is not the best thing for us."

319
00:24:18.574 --> 00:24:19.641
"Let's get married."

320
00:24:20.609 --> 00:24:21.677
"Let's do it right away."

321
00:24:23.312 --> 00:24:24.446
"That is the only way."

322
00:24:31.186 --> 00:24:32.221
What?

323
00:24:42.598 --> 00:24:45.467
What? That wasn't her?

324
00:24:45.467 --> 00:24:47.970
Lee Myung Joo is married
and even has children.

325
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.872
Then, what is this letter about?

326
00:24:49.872 --> 00:24:51.473
I think I know who it is.

327
00:24:51.473 --> 00:24:54.710
There is a patient named Lee Myung Ji.

328
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.446
You got that letter
from a soldier, didn't you?

329
00:24:57.446 --> 00:24:58.480
How did you know?

330
00:24:59.047 --> 00:25:01.250
I remember a soldier came
to see her many times.

331
00:25:44.693 --> 00:25:45.761
Thank you.

332
00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:50.966
Thank you so much.

333
00:26:10.185 --> 00:26:13.155
The hospice is a place where you
don't know what will happen tomorrow.

334
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:15.657
You say to people, see you tomorrow.

335
00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:18.360
When you come the next day,
the patients have often died.

336
00:26:19.861 --> 00:26:23.065
Still, I'm relieved she got the letter
before she passed away.

337
00:26:25.467 --> 00:26:27.336
I guess they'll get married
here in the ward.

338
00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:29.605
Marry in a hospice ward?

339
00:26:29.605 --> 00:26:32.708
Yes, the patient can't leave here.

340
00:26:32.708 --> 00:26:33.976
You never know what can happen.

341
00:26:40.382 --> 00:26:42.384
I think we took too long.

342
00:26:43.685 --> 00:26:45.854
Our homeroom teacher wants
to see you in his office.

343
00:26:59.835 --> 00:27:02.904
Wow, you truly got a taste of this
neighborhood as soon as you got here.

344
00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:04.906
Well, that's all good.

345
00:27:04.906 --> 00:27:06.908
You and Kim Bom
missed the death experience.

346
00:27:06.908 --> 00:27:08.377
You'll have to do it on your own.

347
00:27:08.377 --> 00:27:10.746
- Do I have to do it?
- Yes.

348
00:27:10.746 --> 00:27:13.849
Other things are optional,
but this is mandatory for all juniors.

349
00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:14.883
School rules.

350
00:27:14.883 --> 00:27:17.019
Gosh, I have coffin trauma.

351
00:27:18.687 --> 00:27:22.124
Coffin trauma? I've never heard of that.

352
00:27:22.124 --> 00:27:23.225
It's true.

353
00:27:24.359 --> 00:27:27.429
Okay, well I can't force you.

354
00:27:27.429 --> 00:27:29.164
Let's think about it.

355
00:27:29.164 --> 00:27:32.200
There's an assignment. You have
to come up with a tombstone inscription.

356
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.335
Tombstone inscription?

357
00:27:47.349 --> 00:27:48.984
What is all of this?

358
00:27:48.984 --> 00:27:51.053
You don't even have money.
Why did you buy so much?

359
00:27:51.053 --> 00:27:52.354
I know, right?

360
00:27:52.354 --> 00:27:55.424
But, I have to earn points with Mother.

361
00:27:55.424 --> 00:27:57.592
With your cooking skills?

362
00:27:57.592 --> 00:27:59.094
What?

363
00:28:00.028 --> 00:28:02.364
Is my cooking that bad?

364
00:28:02.364 --> 00:28:06.368
No, I mean the kids and I
have no choice but to eat it.

365
00:28:06.368 --> 00:28:07.536
No choice?

366
00:28:07.869 --> 00:28:10.639
You make your own food starting today.
What "no choice"?

367
00:28:10.639 --> 00:28:15.911
No, I meant that your food
may suit our tastes, but...

368
00:28:15.911 --> 00:28:20.315
I know. My mother-in-law
is famous for being a picky eater.

369
00:28:21.583 --> 00:28:24.653
She's a great cook,
so I guess she's picky too.

370
00:28:24.653 --> 00:28:29.357
Why not cook something she doesn't
know instead of something she cooks well?

371
00:28:29.357 --> 00:28:31.893
Is there something you're good at making?

372
00:28:32.994 --> 00:28:33.995
Ramen?

373
00:28:34.563 --> 00:28:35.564
Forget it.

374
00:28:37.165 --> 00:28:39.735
Let me try first. You never know.

375
00:28:39.735 --> 00:28:43.505
I may win her over, and
she might hand the kitchen over to me.

376
00:28:43.505 --> 00:28:45.440
She might let me manage the household.

377
00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:48.443
My sister must be getting old.

378
00:28:48.443 --> 00:28:50.712
She's in denial of the situation
she's currently in.

379
00:28:50.712 --> 00:28:52.881
Be quiet and help me cook.

380
00:28:52.881 --> 00:28:56.184
Think of it as preparing
a meal for royalty.

381
00:28:56.184 --> 00:28:58.253
I will win with
the thought I put into it.

382
00:28:58.253 --> 00:29:02.124
Yeah, sometimes your food turns out good.

383
00:29:02.124 --> 00:29:04.326
Today could be that day if you're lucky.

384
00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:07.863
Hey, go inside if you
aren't going to help me.

385
00:29:13.702 --> 00:29:15.804
Mother, how is it?

386
00:29:15.804 --> 00:29:17.572
Is the food to your liking?

387
00:29:19.908 --> 00:29:21.076
This is salty.

388
00:29:22.544 --> 00:29:24.112
This lacks flavor.

389
00:29:24.813 --> 00:29:28.250
The taste of the food
is all over the place.

390
00:29:28.984 --> 00:29:32.687
I don't know what kind
of food you like yet.

391
00:29:32.687 --> 00:29:36.958
You didn't know anything
when you married 20 years ago.

392
00:29:40.162 --> 00:29:42.430
There is nothing unusual about my taste.

393
00:29:43.098 --> 00:29:47.135
You've been feeding them food like this.
No wonder the kids are so thin.

394
00:29:47.135 --> 00:29:49.704
What will you put
on your tombstone when you die?

395
00:29:49.704 --> 00:29:51.473
Hey, Lee Shi Kyung.

396
00:29:51.473 --> 00:29:54.342
What kind of rude question
is that to ask your grandmother?

397
00:29:54.342 --> 00:29:56.344
What? It's for my homework.

398
00:29:56.344 --> 00:29:58.880
I have to write my tombstone
inscription and my family's.

399
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.015
It's all right.

400
00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:04.953
In this town, we talk about
people dying as often as we eat.

401
00:30:05.987 --> 00:30:09.958
I'm going to be cremated,
so I don't need a tombstone inscription.

402
00:30:09.958 --> 00:30:12.794
Still, if you were going to have one,
what would it say?

403
00:30:12.794 --> 00:30:14.563
I said I was going to be cremated!

404
00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:17.799
Grandma, why did you say nothing
to Shi Kyung but get mad at me?

405
00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:20.235
- We asked the same thing.
- Stop that.

406
00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:22.404
I told you not to call him Shi Kyung.

407
00:30:26.141 --> 00:30:28.643
Lee Shi Young, get back here!

408
00:30:28.643 --> 00:30:30.545
She has no manners...

409
00:30:31.813 --> 00:30:33.481
just like you.

410
00:30:34.683 --> 00:30:37.052
Mother, when did I ever--

411
00:30:49.698 --> 00:30:52.133
Ah, what is this?

412
00:30:52.133 --> 00:30:55.904
It's so dark out, and there's
nothing to do for fun.

413
00:30:55.904 --> 00:30:57.806
I have to think of
a tombstone inscription.

414
00:31:15.924 --> 00:31:17.926
<i>I can't hear a single thing.</i>

415
00:31:17.926 --> 00:31:21.596
<i>Night time in a rural town
makes me feel like I'm suffocating.</i>

416
00:31:26.735 --> 00:31:28.303
Knock, would you? Knock.

417
00:31:29.571 --> 00:31:32.807
<i>I was so bored that I was
almost happy to see Shi Young.</i>

418
00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:36.278
Must be nice for someone
who has his own room.

419
00:31:37.712 --> 00:31:39.014
Lee Shi Young!

420
00:31:51.026 --> 00:31:53.929
This is just like my life...
this sweet potato.

421
00:31:58.867 --> 00:32:01.903
<i>[I knew if I stayed around long enough,
something like this would happen.]</i>

422
00:32:11.846 --> 00:32:13.581
<i>Why is my tombstone inscription up there?</i>

423
00:32:13.581 --> 00:32:15.283
<i>Did I get caught copying Dad's writing?</i>

424
00:32:18.286 --> 00:32:19.287
Eom Yong Gi?

425
00:32:20.655 --> 00:32:23.158
Tell me what you think of this sentence.

426
00:32:24.092 --> 00:32:25.961
You write very poorly.

427
00:32:27.929 --> 00:32:29.965
Yes, my writing is messy.

428
00:32:29.965 --> 00:32:33.368
But, tell me how you feel
about what's written there.

429
00:32:33.368 --> 00:32:35.070
Being on the run.

430
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:36.504
Being on the run?

431
00:32:36.504 --> 00:32:39.674
When one can't flee and gets caught,
he might say something like that.

432
00:32:39.674 --> 00:32:42.210
That's a fun interpretation.
So like you, Eom Yong Gi.

433
00:32:42.944 --> 00:32:45.480
Next, Lee Shi Young.

434
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.915
It seems like someone's life.

435
00:32:46.915 --> 00:32:48.416
Explain more.

436
00:32:48.416 --> 00:32:51.853
Sticking around, living life carefree,
and when life ends

437
00:32:51.853 --> 00:32:53.321
I think that's what he would say.

438
00:32:53.321 --> 00:32:55.890
<i>Look at her blatantly insulting me.</i>

439
00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.092
<i>Seriously.</i>

440
00:32:57.092 --> 00:32:59.527
Who is this someone?

441
00:32:59.527 --> 00:33:01.262
He probably knows who he is.

442
00:33:01.262 --> 00:33:03.264
He is probably getting
very mad right now.

443
00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:07.402
All right... next.

444
00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:08.670
Park Ga Ram.

445
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:10.505
I know this one.

446
00:33:10.505 --> 00:33:12.007
Okay, tell me.

447
00:33:12.007 --> 00:33:14.042
It's Bernard Shaw's
tombstone inscription.

448
00:33:14.042 --> 00:33:16.244
<i>Bern... who?</i>

449
00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:18.313
And who is Bernard Shaw?

450
00:33:18.313 --> 00:33:20.448
He was a British writer
who won the Nobel Prize.

451
00:33:20.448 --> 00:33:22.984
He was a voracious writer
until the age of 94.

452
00:33:24.019 --> 00:33:26.087
He enjoyed humor, wit, and satire.

453
00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:30.925
I personally think that his tombstone
inscription is humorous and mischievous.

454
00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:33.628
- Wow!
- Applause.

455
00:33:37.332 --> 00:33:40.301
Just like Ga Ram said, this quote...

456
00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:45.673
is what is inscribed
on writer Bernard Shaw's tombstone.

457
00:33:46.307 --> 00:33:51.579
But, someone in our class used
this for his tombstone inscription.

458
00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:54.282
He submitted it like this.

459
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.787
The fake Bernard Shaw
can submit a new one.

460
00:33:58.787 --> 00:34:02.657
It doesn't need to be unique,
but something honest, okay?

461
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:12.700
I see Bom is here.

462
00:34:14.569 --> 00:34:16.971
Shi Kyung and Bom,
come to my office after class.

463
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:19.441
Also, there's a wedding at the hospice.

464
00:34:19.441 --> 00:34:21.476
Anybody who has time, please go help out.

465
00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:23.645
Come see me to sign up to volunteer.

466
00:34:23.645 --> 00:34:26.881
Okay, that's all. Class President?

467
00:34:26.881 --> 00:34:28.349
Attention.

468
00:34:29.417 --> 00:34:30.452
Bow.

469
00:34:40.762 --> 00:34:43.965
Wow! Aren't you Bernard Shaw?

470
00:34:49.604 --> 00:34:50.939
What do you mean?

471
00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:05.186
Really, Dad?

472
00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:08.089
Why didn't you mark it somewhere,
so I would know it was a quote?

473
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:11.793
You made your son look like a fool.

474
00:35:12.794 --> 00:35:14.129
Bernard, what are you doing?

475
00:35:14.129 --> 00:35:15.463
Get out.

476
00:35:15.463 --> 00:35:17.732
Who told you to keep
coming in without knocking?

477
00:35:17.732 --> 00:35:21.469
Bernard, what happened in the office
with that girl, Kim Bom?

478
00:35:24.072 --> 00:35:25.173
She didn't come.

479
00:35:25.773 --> 00:35:27.909
She comes to school when she wants.

480
00:35:27.909 --> 00:35:29.677
She attends things
only when she wants to.

481
00:35:29.677 --> 00:35:30.812
What is she up to?

482
00:35:33.781 --> 00:35:36.718
- What?
- Do you have any right to say that?

483
00:35:36.718 --> 00:35:38.419
What? It was a joke. I'm not that bad--

484
00:35:38.419 --> 00:35:41.923
Kim Bom transferred here also.
Apparently, she's very weird.

485
00:35:42.924 --> 00:35:43.925
Really?

486
00:35:44.993 --> 00:35:49.397
Bernard, the kids are going to buy
some things for the wedding tomorrow.

487
00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:51.466
- Are you going?
- Why would I go?

488
00:35:52.066 --> 00:35:54.836
Since it's Saturday,
I'm going to go play some games...

489
00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:57.038
I heard you were
the matchmaker, Bernard.

490
00:35:57.038 --> 00:35:59.107
Stop saying Bernard, Bernard!

491
00:35:59.107 --> 00:36:02.177
Also, it wasn't like that.
I just ran an errand for someone.

492
00:36:02.177 --> 00:36:03.278
Right?

493
00:36:03.278 --> 00:36:06.848
Bernard would never do
something that thoughtful.

494
00:36:06.848 --> 00:36:09.150
Get out! Just get out.

495
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.685
Bernard, I still have more to say.

496
00:36:10.685 --> 00:36:13.588
Get out. Stop calling me Bernard!

497
00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:16.024
Gosh.

498
00:36:38.813 --> 00:36:39.814
What?

499
00:36:43.084 --> 00:36:46.621
Hey... why are the lights on?

500
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:48.156
My goodness.

501
00:36:48.156 --> 00:36:50.825
Oh my goodness.

502
00:36:54.929 --> 00:36:58.433
Oh, why aren't you sleeping?

503
00:36:58.433 --> 00:36:59.934
I thought my heart was going to stop.

504
00:37:00.535 --> 00:37:02.103
I can't sleep.

505
00:37:02.103 --> 00:37:06.674
You have the lights on, and you're
wearing a mask, so how could you sleep?

506
00:37:06.674 --> 00:37:09.577
I turned on the lights and put this on
because I couldn't sleep.

507
00:37:09.577 --> 00:37:12.113
You have to turn off the lights
in order to sleep.

508
00:37:12.113 --> 00:37:14.616
Turn off the lights now,
and put that mask away.

509
00:37:14.616 --> 00:37:17.452
Grandma, can't you stop snoring?

510
00:37:18.052 --> 00:37:20.555
Snoring? Who?

511
00:37:21.689 --> 00:37:22.790
Me?

512
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.225
Do you think I'm the one snoring?

513
00:37:24.225 --> 00:37:26.828
You've got the wrong person.

514
00:37:26.828 --> 00:37:28.930
I don't snore.

515
00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:30.865
What the heck.

516
00:37:30.865 --> 00:37:32.700
"What the heck"?

517
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.937
What kind of rude comment is that?

518
00:37:35.937 --> 00:37:38.506
Why is that rude?

519
00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:40.408
What is it then? Isn't it a curse word?

520
00:37:40.408 --> 00:37:42.810
It's not a curse word.

521
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.412
Then, what is it?

522
00:37:44.412 --> 00:37:47.382
It's just a saying.
What else could it be?

523
00:37:47.382 --> 00:37:49.751
My goodness. Just a saying, yeah right.

524
00:37:49.751 --> 00:37:51.052
Do you think I enjoy it?

525
00:37:51.052 --> 00:37:53.688
Grandma, you're making
me say "what the heck."

526
00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:56.157
I've never done that.
Hurry up, and turn off the lights.

527
00:37:56.157 --> 00:37:59.427
I don't want to.
You'll start snoring again if I do.

528
00:37:59.427 --> 00:38:02.964
Then... keep the light on all night.

529
00:38:02.964 --> 00:38:07.335
You can keep the mask on all night
and say "what the heck" all you want.

530
00:38:09.304 --> 00:38:10.338
My gosh.

531
00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:14.208
What the heck.

532
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:23.951
You were still sleeping?

533
00:38:24.786 --> 00:38:26.020
It's Saturday.

534
00:38:26.854 --> 00:38:28.356
You must have nothing to do at night.

535
00:38:28.356 --> 00:38:30.358
I heard you don't have a computer.

536
00:38:30.358 --> 00:38:32.593
Sleeping late is a habit,
so I can't fall asleep.

537
00:38:34.462 --> 00:38:37.131
You're going to the market today, right?
I want to go too.

538
00:38:37.131 --> 00:38:38.299
I want to see it.

539
00:38:39.434 --> 00:38:41.602
Sure. What about you, Shi Kyung?

540
00:38:41.602 --> 00:38:43.104
Me?

541
00:38:45.173 --> 00:38:46.708
Why don't you come, Bernard?

542
00:38:47.942 --> 00:38:49.444
I'll come. I will.

543
00:38:50.278 --> 00:38:51.946
I told you to stop that.

544
00:38:53.915 --> 00:38:56.117
- I'll be right back.
- Oh yeah.

545
00:38:56.117 --> 00:38:57.952
Do you have a suit?

546
00:38:57.952 --> 00:38:59.187
Why do I need a suit?

547
00:38:59.187 --> 00:39:01.155
Does that make sense?

548
00:39:01.155 --> 00:39:03.658
Why would I walk the bride
down the aisle?

549
00:39:03.658 --> 00:39:06.260
The bride doesn't have parents
or any siblings.

550
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.363
She's getting married
thanks to Lee Shi Kyung.

551
00:39:08.363 --> 00:39:09.897
Isn't that why?

552
00:39:09.897 --> 00:39:10.932
Yes.

553
00:39:11.833 --> 00:39:14.936
A lot of things that don't make sense
happen in the hospice.

554
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:17.305
It's not like I'm her family.

555
00:39:17.305 --> 00:39:20.641
I would do it happily if I were you.
You don't know when she may die.

556
00:39:20.641 --> 00:39:23.745
It might be hard for you
to get a suit. You're very tall.

557
00:39:23.745 --> 00:39:26.647
Isn't one of Dad's suits at home?
He was tall too.

558
00:39:26.647 --> 00:39:27.949
You actually remember that?

559
00:39:27.949 --> 00:39:29.550
You don't remember?

560
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.452
I suppose that's how Bernard would be.

561
00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:32.653
I told you to stop that.

562
00:39:32.653 --> 00:39:33.821
- Let go.
- Let go now.

563
00:39:33.821 --> 00:39:35.390
- You let go first.
- Let go now!

564
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:36.891
- You let go first.
- Let go.

565
00:39:36.891 --> 00:39:38.092
You let me go first!

566
00:39:38.092 --> 00:39:39.894
Let go!

567
00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:44.432
They must have pounded
the laundry with this, right?

568
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.735
I need to start working.

569
00:39:47.735 --> 00:39:50.371
There are no jobs, are there?

570
00:39:50.371 --> 00:39:52.473
What about you? Aren't you going to work?

571
00:39:52.473 --> 00:39:54.709
Then just go back home to Jeju Island.

572
00:39:54.709 --> 00:39:57.745
No, I can't do that.
Mom will try to set me up with men.

573
00:39:57.745 --> 00:40:01.416
Just wait a little bit.
I'll find a contract position.

574
00:40:01.416 --> 00:40:05.153
Hey, we have other sisters.
Why are you living off me?

575
00:40:05.153 --> 00:40:07.288
I'm most comfortable with you.

576
00:40:08.322 --> 00:40:10.525
Comfortable? You mean I'm a pushover.

577
00:40:10.525 --> 00:40:12.727
That's not true.

578
00:40:14.228 --> 00:40:15.229
Mom.

579
00:40:16.964 --> 00:40:18.699
This is Dad's suit, right?

580
00:40:18.699 --> 00:40:20.868
Where did you find that?

581
00:40:20.868 --> 00:40:23.004
I think he wore this long ago.

582
00:40:23.004 --> 00:40:24.539
It was in Grandma's closet.

583
00:40:24.539 --> 00:40:26.407
It would fit Shi Kyung, wouldn't it?

584
00:40:26.407 --> 00:40:29.043
Shi Kyung needs a suit? Why?

585
00:40:29.043 --> 00:40:30.311
You haven't heard yet?

586
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:33.514
For the first time in his life,
Shi Kyung is the star of a moving story.

587
00:40:33.514 --> 00:40:35.616
What are you talking about?

588
00:40:35.616 --> 00:40:37.452
Isn't that Shi Yoon's suit?

589
00:40:37.452 --> 00:40:39.487
Why did you take that out?

590
00:40:39.487 --> 00:40:42.089
I need to use it for something.
Why? Can I use it?

591
00:40:42.089 --> 00:40:45.126
What are you going to do with it?
Are you going to trash it?

592
00:40:45.126 --> 00:40:48.062
No, Shi Kyung's going to wear it.

593
00:40:48.062 --> 00:40:50.832
Shi Kyung's going to wear a suit?

594
00:40:50.832 --> 00:40:54.469
Would that fit him?
It needs to be ironed.

595
00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:01.476
Hey, I need to speak with you.

596
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:18.192
What are you planning to do?

597
00:41:18.192 --> 00:41:21.095
Pardon? About what?

598
00:41:21.095 --> 00:41:23.531
If you spend all day at home...

599
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:27.101
will money grow from the ground
or drop down from the sky?

600
00:41:27.101 --> 00:41:30.505
I am looking for a job,
but nothing is suitable.

601
00:41:30.505 --> 00:41:33.007
You haven't suffered enough yet.

602
00:41:33.007 --> 00:41:36.177
Are you in a position to be choosy?

603
00:41:36.177 --> 00:41:40.348
Still, there are jobs I would be
good at and jobs I would be bad at.

604
00:41:41.048 --> 00:41:43.851
Is this the time for you
to be picky about jobs?

605
00:41:45.019 --> 00:41:47.622
Go to the hospice and help out there.

606
00:41:58.099 --> 00:42:00.868
Now, I've seen everything.
You're wearing a suit.

607
00:42:00.868 --> 00:42:02.136
I know.

608
00:42:03.337 --> 00:42:04.906
Let me see.

609
00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:10.912
What is it? Is it strange?

610
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.381
No.

611
00:42:14.549 --> 00:42:18.052
Your dad's suit fits you perfectly,
although it is a bit old-fashioned.

612
00:42:19.554 --> 00:42:21.889
Why does that matter?
I'm only going to wear it once.

613
00:42:24.892 --> 00:42:26.727
Why did you bother coming here anyway?

614
00:42:26.727 --> 00:42:28.663
Do you have business here?

615
00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:31.566
No, it's not that.

616
00:42:31.566 --> 00:42:32.767
Are you all ready?

617
00:42:36.404 --> 00:42:37.505
Wow.

618
00:42:37.505 --> 00:42:39.640
- Should I go now?
- Yes.

619
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.243
Go get the bride
and come out to the lobby.

620
00:42:42.243 --> 00:42:45.179
I heard there's a congratulatory song.
Who's singing it?

621
00:42:45.179 --> 00:42:46.647
My aunt is a good singer.

622
00:42:47.448 --> 00:42:49.183
The groom prepared something.

623
00:44:30.184 --> 00:44:31.952
An art therapist?

624
00:44:31.952 --> 00:44:36.424
Ah... that's not something
we need right now.

625
00:44:37.324 --> 00:44:41.028
Do you happen to have
a license as a hospice nurse?

626
00:44:41.896 --> 00:44:42.897
No.

627
00:44:42.897 --> 00:44:47.368
We need nurses, people
to clean, cook, and do laundry.

628
00:44:47.935 --> 00:44:51.138
This place is so far out
that people don't want to come here.

629
00:44:52.373 --> 00:44:57.278
Then... is cleaning and laundry
something that I could do right away?

630
00:44:57.278 --> 00:44:58.279
Yes.

631
00:44:58.279 --> 00:45:01.882
But, that's not something
just anyone can do either.

632
00:45:01.882 --> 00:45:03.718
The work here can get very busy.

633
00:45:03.718 --> 00:45:05.953
It's difficult for everyone
if one person struggles.

634
00:45:06.654 --> 00:45:07.722
I see.

635
00:45:08.522 --> 00:45:10.791
Lee Myung Ji is having an emergency.

636
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:11.826
Okay.

637
00:45:14.595 --> 00:45:18.299
She passed out right after the wedding.
I was really worried about her.

638
00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:20.367
Yeah, I was shocked too.

639
00:45:20.367 --> 00:45:23.437
Thankfully, she isn't in danger now.
She should be okay, right?

640
00:45:23.437 --> 00:45:25.239
She has to be.
They love each other so much.

641
00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:27.675
By the way, your brother...

642
00:45:27.675 --> 00:45:29.043
What brother?

643
00:45:29.043 --> 00:45:31.512
I heard that Shi Kyung
is your older brother.

644
00:45:31.512 --> 00:45:34.815
- He said that?
- No, Ga Ram told me.

645
00:45:34.815 --> 00:45:37.051
What about it?

646
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:39.420
He looked really handsome in there.

647
00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:43.691
When he pushed the bride's wheelchair in,
he was like totally awesome...

648
00:45:43.691 --> 00:45:46.694
You will really regret
saying that later on.

649
00:45:46.694 --> 00:45:48.262
Regret it? Why?

650
00:45:48.262 --> 00:45:49.830
Just wait a little while.

651
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.166
You'll see Bernard's true nature soon.

652
00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:53.801
- Huh?
- What was that?

653
00:45:58.906 --> 00:46:00.541
That was Bom, right?

654
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:02.810
How unusual to see her at the hospice.

655
00:46:04.745 --> 00:46:05.813
Why is she here?

656
00:46:06.614 --> 00:46:09.450
What a relief.
She's no longer in danger.

657
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:11.385
Is she really okay?

658
00:46:12.653 --> 00:46:15.156
You never know at the hospice.

659
00:46:16.223 --> 00:46:17.892
She just got married.

660
00:46:18.859 --> 00:46:20.127
She has to live a long time.

661
00:46:21.595 --> 00:46:22.730
Oh yeah.

662
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:24.932
Why don't you do
the death experience now?

663
00:46:24.932 --> 00:46:28.402
Do I have to do that?
What happens if I don't?

664
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:32.106
Well, I don't really know.

665
00:46:32.106 --> 00:46:33.808
No one has ever held out and refused.

666
00:46:35.376 --> 00:46:37.812
<i>Honestly...</i>

667
00:46:39.713 --> 00:46:41.282
<i>I never had coffin trauma.</i>

668
00:46:42.983 --> 00:46:46.720
<i>I simply might have been
too lazy to do all of this.</i>

669
00:46:47.655 --> 00:46:49.890
<i>Finding meaning in something like this.</i>

670
00:46:54.295 --> 00:46:56.931
I'll close the coffin.
Just rest comfortably.

671
00:46:57.698 --> 00:47:00.467
Don't force yourself to think
about your tombstone inscription.

672
00:47:17.585 --> 00:47:18.686
Lee Shi Kyung.

673
00:47:19.553 --> 00:47:20.654
Just listen.

674
00:47:21.355 --> 00:47:22.389
<i>Just now...</i>

675
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.960
<i>Lee Myung Ji passed away.</i>

676
00:47:28.229 --> 00:47:32.199
She wanted you to know
that she was thankful.

677
00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:38.873
I really hate this kind of thing.

678
00:47:40.341 --> 00:47:41.642
What am I doing?

679
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:45.246
So, what?

680
00:47:46.213 --> 00:47:49.650
What changes if I lie in this coffin and
think about my tombstone inscription?

681
00:47:50.684 --> 00:47:54.355
I just want to go to school
and sleep during class.

682
00:47:54.355 --> 00:47:56.123
I want to play games at internet cafes.

683
00:47:57.691 --> 00:48:00.027
I just want to live like that.

684
00:48:00.027 --> 00:48:02.730
Why do I have lie down here?

685
00:48:03.664 --> 00:48:07.268
Why do I have to hear about the
death of a bride who just got married?

686
00:48:11.305 --> 00:48:15.442
She was so happy to receive that letter.
Why do I have to hear about her death!

687
00:48:15.442 --> 00:48:17.311
You're so loud, seriously!

688
00:48:19.914 --> 00:48:20.948
Kim Bom.

689
00:48:20.948 --> 00:48:23.450
You made me forget the
tombstone inscription I thought up.

690
00:48:24.818 --> 00:48:26.553
Ah, the thing is...

691
00:48:29.056 --> 00:48:30.557
You can do my assignment too.

692
00:49:06.093 --> 00:49:07.428
<i>Hot tears.</i>

693
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:10.731
<i>Warm hand.</i>

694
00:49:31.118 --> 00:49:33.287
<i>Someone with a bright smile...</i>

695
00:49:38.425 --> 00:49:40.427
<i>is now gone from this world.</i>

696
00:49:53.674 --> 00:49:55.542
<i>Still, the morning came as always.</i>

697
00:49:56.377 --> 00:49:57.711
<i>As for me,
who was still alive...</i>

698
00:49:59.446 --> 00:50:01.849
<i>I opened my eyes
to the aroma of soybean stew.</i>

699
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:04.585
<i>Lee Shi Kyung, wake up and come eat.</i>

700
00:50:08.555 --> 00:50:11.458
Today's soybean stew
is special, so enjoy it.

701
00:50:12.092 --> 00:50:13.527
Soybean stew is soybean stew.

702
00:50:19.633 --> 00:50:20.667
Awesome!

703
00:50:23.771 --> 00:50:25.172
Totally awesome.

704
00:50:25.172 --> 00:50:26.473
You made this, Mom?

705
00:50:26.473 --> 00:50:29.076
No, your grandma made it.

706
00:50:29.076 --> 00:50:30.511
No wonder.

707
00:50:30.511 --> 00:50:32.846
Shi Kyung, you try it too.

708
00:50:32.846 --> 00:50:34.415
Shi Kyung doesn't like soybean stew.

709
00:50:34.415 --> 00:50:36.050
Just try one spoonful.

710
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:38.385
This is no average soybean stew.

711
00:50:38.385 --> 00:50:39.420
Okay.

712
00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:46.527
Wow.

713
00:50:50.764 --> 00:50:52.699
How can soybean stew taste like this?

714
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.169
- This is art.
- Right?

715
00:50:55.169 --> 00:50:57.671
What was that soybean stew
Mom had been making for us?

716
00:50:59.807 --> 00:51:02.643
<i>I was alive and my appetite was too.</i>

717
00:51:02.643 --> 00:51:04.311
You look like you're enjoying it.

718
00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:08.315
Seeing how well you eat,
my grandson will live well.

719
00:51:08.315 --> 00:51:10.150
You sure know good food.

720
00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:14.955
Here you go. Eat up.

721
00:51:14.955 --> 00:51:17.558
No matter how much of this you eat,
you won't get tired of it.

722
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:23.464
Mom, Lee Shi Kyung went
to an internet cafe yesterday.

723
00:51:24.364 --> 00:51:25.365
Again?

724
00:51:26.066 --> 00:51:28.168
- Lee Shi Kyung, you--
- That's enough.

725
00:51:28.168 --> 00:51:30.704
One doesn't even bother
a dog when it is eating.

726
00:51:30.704 --> 00:51:33.907
Eat up, nice and full.

727
00:51:33.907 --> 00:51:37.010
Mother, did you give Shi Kyung money?

728
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.245
What do you mean?

729
00:51:38.245 --> 00:51:41.348
It's just that he wouldn't have
money for internet cafes.

730
00:51:41.348 --> 00:51:45.519
Internet cafes or whatever,
I told you to stop while he's eating.

731
00:51:49.289 --> 00:51:50.524
This won't do.

732
00:51:50.524 --> 00:51:53.260
Lee Shi Kyung, you are not
getting an allowance starting today.

733
00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.095
- Mom!
- Mother.

734
00:51:55.095 --> 00:51:58.165
You cannot give Shi Kyung
money in the future.

735
00:51:58.165 --> 00:52:00.367
Why do I have to listen to you?

736
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:03.203
Mother, he's going to be
in trouble, at this rate.

737
00:52:03.203 --> 00:52:06.340
You're in bigger trouble, in my opinion.

738
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.609
Why can't you trust your own child?

739
00:52:08.609 --> 00:52:12.012
He's Shi Yoon's son.
I'm sure he can take care of himself.

740
00:52:12.012 --> 00:52:13.514
Leave him alone!

741
00:52:13.514 --> 00:52:14.615
Mother!

742
00:52:14.615 --> 00:52:16.450
<i>Oh, Grandma.</i>

743
00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:19.920
You couldn't trust your husband,
and you harassed him.

744
00:52:22.823 --> 00:52:25.692
I worry about him

745
00:52:25.692 --> 00:52:27.528
because he's Lee Shi Yoon's son.

746
00:52:27.528 --> 00:52:30.697
What did you say? You--

747
00:52:34.868 --> 00:52:37.704
Forget it. That's enough this morning.

748
00:52:40.574 --> 00:52:43.877
I can breathe because
I have two nostrils.

749
00:52:43.877 --> 00:52:45.913
Breathe.

750
00:52:47.814 --> 00:52:51.084
You said one doesn't even
bother a dog when it's eating.

751
00:52:52.586 --> 00:52:53.654
What?

752
00:52:54.888 --> 00:52:56.256
<i>As for me, who is still alive...</i>

753
00:52:57.257 --> 00:53:01.562
<i>I really need money to go
to the internet cafe today.</i>

754
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.185
How can there not even be any coins?

755
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:11.765
<i>What's with her?</i>

756
00:54:12.499 --> 00:54:14.534
<i>She has a different face
every time I see her.</i>

757
00:54:14.534 --> 00:54:16.637
<i>She's doing something strange
every time I see her.</i>

758
00:54:16.637 --> 00:54:18.305
<i>Look at her now.</i>

759
00:54:18.905 --> 00:54:20.807
<i>She's making me do her homework.</i>

760
00:54:20.807 --> 00:54:22.509
<i>Where is she going all alone?</i>

761
