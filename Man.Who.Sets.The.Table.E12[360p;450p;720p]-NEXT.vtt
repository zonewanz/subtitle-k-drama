00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.770
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.340
Her eyes light up whenever 
she sees something to eat.

3
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.020
Here.

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.520
Pick whatever you want to eat.

5
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.620
The test results should be in.

6
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.830
Let's call them.

7
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.340
I left my phone.

8
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.280
Are you going to eat all of this?

9
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.120
She must think I'm really rich.

10
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.350
No, just buy three.

11
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.590
Okay, fine.

12
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.660
You can't eat like this when 
you're at a children's shelter.

13
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.280
Okay, I'll buy all of this.

14
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.800
What is a shelter?

15
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.510
Let's see. It's...

16
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.410
a place where kids like you...

17
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.200
gather, play, study,

18
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.880
and live.

19
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.550
Stay here. I'll pay for this.

20
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.900
I want to live with Dad.

21
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.470
Why is he here?

22
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.510
Genetic examination lab?

23
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.430
Paternity test?

24
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.940
Please wait one day.

25
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.380
Please do something 
after the results are in.

26
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.220
Today is the day.

27
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.840
I need to dress up for a day like this.

28
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.490
After that, I will solve 
this matter elegantly.

29
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.800
Mom.

30
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.780
- Mom. - Yes?

31
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.970
Are you going somewhere?

32
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.190
Why are you so slow for a young person?

33
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.240
Don't just fill your stomach 
with things like that.

34
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.410
Fill your brain with knowledge.

35
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.770
Your head and mine are both empty.

36
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.020
So where are you going?

37
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.490
Today's the day your 
father-in-law's paternity test comes in.

38
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.430
That's right. It's today.

39
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.280
Should we go to my in-law's house?

40
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.010
We shouldn't go there.

41
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.020
They're probably over "There".

42
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.730
Let's go "There".

43
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.050
Where is "There"?

44
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.860
They can't take a kid to a motel or a sauna.

45
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.530
"There" is the only place.

46
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.740
Okay.

47
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.530
Mom, are we meddling too much with their affairs?

48
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.200
I have three younger siblings.

49
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.270
Whenever your aunts and uncles were in trouble,

50
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.160
I would solve their matters for them.

51
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.550
I would always solve matters for my friends too.

52
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.570
My nickname is "The Whistle of Cheongdam".

53
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.520
Okay.

54
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.640
- Do your best blowing the whistle. - Okay.

55
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.190
Oh, my goodness.

56
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.330
What a mess they made.

57
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.080
Where did they all go?

58
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.420
Unbelievable.

59
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.500
Wait.

60
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800
This is a kid's sock. Why is it here?

61
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.290
Why are there baby shoes? What are those?

62
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.860
I bought them as a present for So Won's wife.

63
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.050
But now that she isn't carrying a baby, I'll give them to her later.

64
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.550
Is there a kid in this house?

65
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.330
Yes, So Won.

66
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.820
Why are you answering his phone?

67
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.940
I called Father.

68
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.310
He must have forgotten his phone here.

69
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.960
Mom, where are you now?

70
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.260
At your studio.

71
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Hey, does a kid live in this studio?

72
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.380
What?

73
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.150
A kid? Why do you ask?

74
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.640
I saw kid's socks.

75
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.520
Last time, I saw kid's shoes too.

76
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.190
I see. Well, that...

77
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.400
A kid from next door comes by time to time. Don't worry about that.

78
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.220
Wait, Mom. Don't stay there.

79
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.020
You should go home now. Hurry.

80
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.950
Hey, there's no way.

81
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.220
The house is in such a mess. I should clean before I go.

82
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.760
I don't want you to get tired. Just go home.

83
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.890
Hurry.

84
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.830
Don't worry about me.

85
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.900
But So Won,

86
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.530
there's a registered mail under your dad's name.

87
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.070
It's from the DNA Testing Center from Korean General Hospital.

88
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.140
What is this about?

89
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.060
What? That's...

90
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.690
Mom, did you open it?

91
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.280
You didn't open it, did you?

92
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.210
No, not yet.

93
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.220
What is this?

94
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.450
Don't open it. You must not.

95
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.320
Mom, you can't ever open that. Okay? You cannot open it.

96
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.940
I'm on my way, so don't open it.

97
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.010
This is driving me crazy.

98
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.970
Mr. Kim, if you see a fruit stand on the way, stop the car.

99
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.970
Why would you buy fruit at a time like this?

100
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.210
Look at you.

101
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.640
There's a kid. How can I go without bearing gifts?

102
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.080
Besides, that kid isn't just anyone.

103
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.460
That's your sister-in-law.

104
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.370
Hey, don't be mean to your sister-in-law.

105
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.390
You're right.

106
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.320
Now that I think about it, she's my youngest sister-in-law.

107
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.080
Goodness, it's unbelievable.

108
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.470
Don't open it. You must not.

109
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.250
You can't ever open that. Okay? You cannot open it.

110
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.400
What is this? Why is he making a fuss over this?

111
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.650
"DNA Testing Center from Korean General Hospital"?

112
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.340
(DNA Testing Center from Korean General Hospital)

113
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.440
"Grand-prize winner among hospitals with high level of satisfaction..."

114
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.310
"in paternity tests."

115
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.320
A paternity test?

116
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.750
What does this all mean?

117
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:24.070
"The test result shows a 99 percent probability of paternity..."

118
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.580
"between the client, Lee Shin Mo, and the subject, Oh Han Gyul."

119
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.880
What?

120
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.330
Do you want to live with a purpose?

121
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.990
Do you want to raise a kid? It's a girl.

122
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.330
This was it.

123
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.640
Mom!

124
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.580
(The result shows a 99 percent chance of blood relation.)

125
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.700
Did you know?

126
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:22.630
Did you?

127
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.070
This...

128
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.770
This was why.

129
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.710
Your father didn't even come home.

130
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.640
He spent days here.

131
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.900
Mom, please calm down. I'll explain everything.

132
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.530
Dad has done nothing wrong.

133
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.600
So don't get the wrong idea about this.

134
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.770
This is all a big misunderstanding.

135
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.090
A misunderstanding?

136
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.960
Then what is this?

137
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.230
It says his name, Lee Shin Mo.

138
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.560
It's clearly written on here.

139
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.280
Are you saying that this isn't his paternity test?

140
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.020
This is the test he requested.

141
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.890
He did have a DNA test.

142
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.490
But it's not what you think, Mom.

143
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.890
It says it's a 99 percent probability,

144
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.080
but this isn't Father's fault. What I mean is that...

145
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.000
Mom, please don't get the wrong idea.

146
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.030
Stop. I don't want to hear it.

147
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.740
Stop saying it's a misunderstanding. Where is your father?

148
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.290
Well, I don't know where he is.

149
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.060
So Won, are you here?

150
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.560
Yes, Father!

151
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.440
Take her off my back. She fell asleep.

152
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.570
Goodness, she's heavy.

153
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.390
Father, we have a problem.

154
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.890
A problem? What is it?

155
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.400
Mom's inside.

156
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.550
What?

157
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.120
Hey, why did you tell me that now?

158
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.290
I didn't come in here. Got that?

159
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.550
Young... Young...

160
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.400
Young Hye, you're here.

161
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.020
She's the next-door-neighbor.

162
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.160
I don't know why she sleeps here.

163
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.030
Goodness, she's strange.

164
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.480
Hey, take her home. Oh, my.

165
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.420
Goodness.

166
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.450
What are you doing?

167
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.430
What is this?

168
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.460
(The result shows a 99 percent chance of blood relation.)

169
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.980
How did this...

170
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.470
I was right.

171
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.670
Han Gyul is our family.

172
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.540
Oh, my.

173
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.840
When...

174
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.660
will it end with you?

175
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.350
You mistreated me and poured out your anger on me for 34 years!

176
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.220
As that wasn't enough, are you determined to ruin my life?

177
00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.410
You want to drag my life into the gutter, don't you?

178
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.460
That's what you want, isn't it?

179
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.250
Honey, I take that you read this paper.

180
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.910
You mustn't jump to conclusions.

181
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.380
I swear to the universe.

182
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.390
I've lived my life without leaving a trace of shame.

183
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.120
Just because of this piece of paper,

184
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.890
I can't forgive you if you treat me like a scumbag,

185
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.980
cheater, and piece of trash.

186
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.980
What? Forgive me? You don't have the right to forgive me.

187
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.770
You don't want me to treat you as such because of a piece of paper?

188
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.670
Fine. Then you'd better start talking then.

189
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.590
That kid. Who is that kid?

190
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.410
The rest result shows a 99 percent chance of paternity with you.

191
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.050
So Won said himself that she's our family.

192
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.700
Who is that kid?

193
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.390
Mom, it's...

194
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.710
No. I clearly told you not to jump to conclusions.

195
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.500
Do you want me to make you regret treating me like a scumbag?

196
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.090
Mr. Lee Shin Mo!

197
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.820
Fine. I got it. I'll tell you.

198
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.910
I have nothing that's stopping me now.

199
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.750
I'll explain this clearly so you won't be able to talk back to me.

200
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.300
Don't be surprised when you hear this.

201
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.300
This kid...

202
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.970
is...

203
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.690
She is...

204
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.040
Father!

205
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.360
The door was open.

206
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.500
Goodness, it's already over.

207
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.520
Ms. Hong, I can't imagine what you must be going through now.

208
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.420
I can't believe this.

209
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.830
Everyone knew?

210
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.200
Everyone was in on this? You made a fool out of me?

211
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.250
How could you do this to me?

212
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.050
- Ms. Hong, men are... - I'm glad this happened.

213
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.250
This isn't something you can hide.

214
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.260
You'd better explain everything in front of everyone.

215
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.340
That kid.

216
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.940
Whose kid is that?

217
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.150
I'll tell you everything.

218
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.220
Mom.

219
00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.560
The truth is...

220
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.660
she is...

221
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.100
- my... - His sister!

222
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.930
It's So Won's sister.

223
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.430
So...

224
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.970
she's my daughter.

225
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.710
I'm sorry, Young Hye.

226
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.590
Mom.

227
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.200
Did her mom die suddenly?

228
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.530
Why did you bring her so suddenly?

229
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.700
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.440
Goodness.

231
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.580
Mom, let me explain.

232
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.900
Calm down first.

233
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.290
Don't say anything.

234
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.450
I don't want to hear anything right now.

235
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.360
Just leave me alone.

236
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.690
- Mom. - Just leave me alone.

237
00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.930
How did I become an adult like this?

238
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.330
I'm not welcome anywhere. I'm living life as a loser.

239
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.580
What's on your mind?

240
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.250
I'm thinking about the past.

241
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.450
Just a few months ago, I failed my interview,

242
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.690
and I was dumped by Myung Tae.

243
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.360
I even thought about ending my life.

244
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.590
What about now?

245
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:35.900
From tomorrow, I'm finally going to work at the headquarters.

246
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.470
I'm filled with emotion.

247
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.600
That's why life is exciting.

248
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.240
You don't know what will happen.

249
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.310
I have something to give you.

250
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.310
Close your eyes and hold out your hand.

251
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.910
My hand?

252
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.190
This is so sudden.

253
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.060
My fingers are rather thick.

254
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.540
Don't open your eyes.

255
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.170
Okay.

256
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.580
What is this?

257
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.950
Did you want to give me this?

258
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.860
Did you expect something else like a ring?

259
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.460
- I'll go buy one. - No.

260
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.560
I wasn't expecting a ring.

261
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.530
I'll open this.

262
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.200
What could this be?

263
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.040
It's a knife I used when first started.

264
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.420
Congratulations...

265
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.920
on properly entering the cooking world.

266
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.190
Start using this tomorrow.

267
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:12.930
Chef.

268
00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:15.960
They say you shouldn't give a knife as a present to a cook.

269
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.600
I can't accept money from you.

270
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:28.380
I paid you generously.

271
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.210
You're being naughty.

272
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.280
I'm going to do my best.

273
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:37.950
Really?

274
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.090
Let's go shop for groceries as a date.

275
00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.140
This is really expensive.

276
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.780
Why are you shopping now when we're starting work tomorrow?

277
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.650
It's Manager Joo's orders.

278
00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.380
She asked to prepare a special meal since she'll eat with the chairman.

279
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.520
We need to go prepare beforehand.

280
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.990
That's why you're spending money generously.

281
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.760
The chairman must be very picky, right?

282
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.760
He must be. He has fine taste.

283
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.300
I'm curious about...

284
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.210
the private life of the successful businessman who was an adoptee.

285
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.510
He also had a lot of rumors at the hotel...

286
00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.950
that he was very mysterious.

287
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.120
He hid his real name, so he was called "Mr. X".

288
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.120
That sounds like something a rich man would do. What else?

289
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.690
There was something unusual.

290
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:51.460
He doesn't like alcohol, so we couldn't use alcohol in his food.

291
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.960
He even threw out the alcohol from the minibar of his hotel room.

292
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.670
Is he allergic to alcohol like me?

293
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.900
Who did he travel with?

294
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.170
He was always alone.

295
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.340
Rumor has it that he was wounded by love,

296
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.890
so he remained single for the rest of his life.

297
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.510
Wounded by love?

298
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.480
Was he wounded by Manager Joo's mother?

299
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.880
Why are you so curious?

300
00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.220
Ask him yourself when you meet him tomorrow.

301
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.700
It's hard to imagine...

302
00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.770
that you're drinking something else than alcohol.

303
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.540
It's also hard to imagine...

304
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.170
that you are a mother now.

305
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.840
Do you only have a son and a daughter that I saw last time?

306
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.620
Of course, they're my only children.

307
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.090
Why are you asking that?

308
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.690
Just to be sure.

309
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.860
You wanted to have a child then.

310
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.730
That's why you wanted to get married.

311
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.110
Stop talking about the past.

312
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.630
I don't even want to think about it.

313
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.930
It looks like...

314
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.890
you're successful.

315
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.040
Successful?

316
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.010
I always thought about you.

317
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.620
Your sister said that you went missing from the river.

318
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.520
I never believed that.

319
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.460
That's why I wanted to make you regret...

320
00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.690
when I saw you again.

321
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.230
That's why I was determined to make a lot of money.

322
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.430
Do you still own the restaurant in Seattle?

323
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.390
- Do you want me to? - I don't...

324
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.510
want to be involved with you anymore.

325
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.680
Please go back to America immediately.

326
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.950
I don't know how you found me,

327
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:57.180
but I'm not the old me that you knew.

328
00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.750
I changed my name, and I have a family to take care of.

329
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.190
I won't let my family get hurt...

330
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.960
because of my past with you.

331
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.860
So?

332
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.700
You only hurt me,

333
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.640
and I committed a big sin to you.

334
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.610
But we're both unharmed and that's enough.

335
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.150
Let's completely end our ties here.

336
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.290
I came here to tell you that.

337
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.260
I came here thinking...

338
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.460
that there was something left in our relationship.

339
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.200
Are you saying that the past is just the past?

340
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.370
Okay.

341
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.340
As you said,

342
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.210
if we don't have anything left in our relationship,

343
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.240
it makes sense to ends things.

344
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.150
We'll never meet again.

345
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:03.750
Please go back.

346
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.290
Thank you.

347
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.430
It's all over now.

348
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.960
It really is all over now.

349
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.840
This is a photo when I first met Anna.

350
00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.500
When you went to the Seattle Dance Academy?

351
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.320
Anna immigrated to follow her sister.

352
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.390
So was she a Korean-American?

353
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.540
Why did she change her name to Jung Hwa Young...

354
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.190
to live in Korea?

355
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.530
Was she in trouble in America?

356
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.800
She suddenly disappeared one day.

357
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.470
There were rumors that she was living with a man.

358
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.440
A man?

359
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:30.590
Who?

360
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.670
He was as student.

361
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.780
She met him while she was working part-time at the dance academy.

362
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.780
He told me he was managing a rather big restaurant in Seattle.

363
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.320
I don't quite remember his name.

364
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.290
Wait, it was "Jay". His name was Jay.

365
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:47.440
Is he American?

366
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.990
No, he was a Korean-American.

367
00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.680
After that, I came back to Korea...

368
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.480
and haven't heard about her since.

369
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.460
Wait. You told me she had a sister.

370
00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.080
Is she still in America?

371
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.270
I think so.

372
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.990
Her name is Sarah Kang.

373
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.540
She was a teacher at the Seattle Dance Academy.

374
00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:08.380
Really?

375
00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.210
Sarah Kang.

376
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.070
I beg you. She's happy right now.

377
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.180
Please don't do anything bad to her.

378
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.640
I don't know what this is about,

379
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.040
but it's already been 30 years.

380
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.610
Of course.

381
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.680
I was just curious.

382
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.900
Don't worry.

383
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.940
Please, I can't wait any longer.

384
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.710
I'm so anxious and worried. I need to know.

385
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.650
Who...

386
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.120
are you?

387
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.670
Is Anna Kang your real name?

388
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.690
Why did you change your name and hide your past?

389
00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.030
What is it that you're hiding?

390
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.700
All right. I'll tell you everything.

391
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.270
But you should know this.

392
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
The reason why I didn't tell any of this to you or Tae Yang...

393
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.710
was because I didn't want you to share my burden.

394
00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.930
If you had found out about this,

395
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.200
you would have been burdened, just like I was.

396
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.350
Tell me. It's fine by me. Tell me.

397
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.390
My name...

398
00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:27.960
is Anna Kang.

399
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:33.080
I was in eighth grade when I moved to America.

400
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.300
My sister had married an American and was living in Seattle.

401
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.970
Is that...

402
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.700
where you met Tae Yang's father?

403
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.200
While I was living at her house,

404
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.410
I was stressed because I felt like I was being a nuisance.

405
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.140
That's when he came...

406
00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.850
to me like a miracle.

407
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.120
Six months later, we decided to move in together,

408
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.190
and we were happy at first.

409
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.390
But when his business began to fail,

410
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.360
he began to change as well.

411
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.460
How?

412
00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.610
He started drinking.

413
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.220
I tried my best to stop him.

414
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.850
I coaxed him, got angry at him,

415
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.700
and even tried to have a baby thinking it could change him.

416
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.380
And then... And then...

417
00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.330
"the incident" happened.

418
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.410
"The incident"? What incident?

419
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.560
I have a son and a daughter that I had with my husband.

420
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.890
But I didn't have your child.

421
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.550
Sir, you need to pay for that.

422
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.700
Let me go.

423
00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.640
Tell me. What happened?

424
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.630
Tell me.

425
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.110
What happened in America?

426
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.920
It was an accident.

427
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.250
I didn't do it on purpose. It was an accident.

428
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.210
Where are you going?

429
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.680
Let me go. I can't live like this.

430
00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.000
Gosh. How dare you?

431
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.240
I did everything for you.

432
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.210
Why are you trying to leave me too?

433
00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.740
Why?

434
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.250
Why? Why do you want to leave me?

435
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:20.690
Why do you want to leave me?

436
00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:47.000
That's why you ran away to Korea?

437
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.180
I thought he was dead.

438
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.520
Jay! Jay!

439
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.490
Jay! Jay!

440
00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:55.960
Jay!

441
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.660
That's why I hid everything...

442
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.270
and lived as an unregistered person until I met Jin Ho.

443
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.910
But he's alive.

444
00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.250
I just met him.

445
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.450
It was self-defense, but the fact that I had killed someone...

446
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.650
troubled me so much.

447
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.460
But now that I know he's alive,

448
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.660
I feel freed from that burden.

449
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:34.490
Does he...

450
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.200
know about Tae Yang?

451
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.770
He doesn't.

452
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:43.240
I found out that I was pregnant only after I came to Korea.

453
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.390
He won't find out about Tae Yang.

454
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.740
And he mustn't.

455
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.280
And he has no feelings for you...

456
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.000
left?

457
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.890
He promised not to appear in front of me again.

458
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.020
All right.

459
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.620
I am relieved.

460
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.260
As long as he doesn't find out about Tae Yang,

461
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.200
we don't need to see him again.

462
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.600
I'm sorry.

463
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.840
Are you disappointed in me?

464
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.370
To be honest,

465
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.740
I am very shocked.

466
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.740
Gosh, I'm so happy that we're going to...

467
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.040
dine with Chairman Kevin tomorrow.

468
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.980
I am worried already...

469
00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.800
that you might keep eating even when the chairman is talking.

470
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.570
I'm worried about myself too.

471
00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:49.890
In that case, I'll eat something before the meeting.

472
00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:50.890
About four meals?

473
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.090
How about three?

474
00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.420
Then I can eat an average amount when we dine.

475
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.680
I should definitely do that.

476
00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.110
Wait.

477
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.950
- Isn't that Chairman Kevin? - I think you're right.

478
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:11.520
Chairman Kevin, are you all right?

479
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.890
Chairman Kevin!

480
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.860
Should I call 911?

481
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.380
Help me walk.

482
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.920
Can you walk?

483
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.970
Yes.

484
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.000
You should come out slowly.

485
00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:27.890
Take me to my room.

486
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.360
I'll clean up. You should go first.

487
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.360
- Thanks. - Sure.

488
00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.450
Let's go.

489
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:47.730
Chairman Kevin, you should sit over here.

490
00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.880
Medicine... Give me my medicine.

491
00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.970
Medicine? Where is it?

492
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.870
Here. It's in my desk drawer.

493
00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.190
(Treatment for Alcoholism)

494
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.800
Dad!

495
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.400
Are you all right?

496
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.600
Here's the medicine.

497
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.290
Why are you here? Get out.

498
00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:34.710
- If there's anything I could... - I said, get out!

499
00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:40.780
Hold on.

500
00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.920
Don't tell anyone about this.

501
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.650
Yes.

502
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:15.050
I'm so worried that I don't feel like eating.

503
00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:18.920
What's going to happen to my youngest sister-in-law?

504
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:21.320
People should...

505
00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:24.160
be generous.

506
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.980
People even adopt children from orphanage.

507
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.400
She's her husband's child.

508
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.800
She has no choice but to raise her.

509
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.190
I'm sure you'd do that...

510
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.910
since you're so generous.

511
00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.570
No way.

512
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:44.510
I'm generous in every sense,

513
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.950
but I won't accept someone else's child.

514
00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:48.380
Why not?

515
00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.920
I have a reason...

516
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.260
from a long time ago.

517
00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.820
That's all you need to know.

518
00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.460
Really?

519
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.970
I wonder...

520
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.970
who her mother is.

521
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.470
Where did Father meet her and got her pregnant?

522
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:17.640
It's so obvious. There's no other place.

523
00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.650
It's either from work or while he was drinking.

524
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.670
Genetics are really something else.

525
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:29.490
She looks just like your father-in-law.

526
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:31.090
No.

527
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.080
I was surprised to see how she resembles my husband.

528
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.600
Why would you be surprised? You idiot.

529
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.200
That's obvious between brother and sister.

530
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:43.470
That's right.

531
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:45.920
Chae Min must love her dad.

532
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.730
She stays next to her dad.

533
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.010
What are you doing?

534
00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.280
She doesn't care.

535
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.300
What are you going to do now?

536
00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.170
Gosh.

537
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.410
I think you made a mistake.

538
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:24.010
I can't lie anymore.

539
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.650
What else then?

540
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.970
Are you going to confess that she's your child...

541
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.220
and get divorced?

542
00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.670
If you get divorced,

543
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.110
you'll lose everything including your house and hospital.

544
00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.920
You'll be left with nothing.

545
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.140
You know what Mrs. Yang is like.

546
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.080
She'll be furious that you made her only daughter cry.

547
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.350
She'll take everything.

548
00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.900
But I can't put the blame on you.

549
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.740
You may be fine, but I can't do this to Mom.

550
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.610
I know your mom better than you do.

551
00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.280
She'll be like that for a few days, then she'll give in.

552
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.370
That's how much she loves me.

553
00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.740
If that's true, why does she want a marriage graduation?

554
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.550
That's because other people instigated her.

555
00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.860
Anyway, don't worry about a thing.

556
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.400
I asked her before.

557
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.900
She said she will never babysit her grandchild.

558
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.640
So I must say she's my child...

559
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.000
for your mom to take care of her.

560
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.670
My goodness.

561
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.010
Hey, So Won.

562
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.150
I'm old now,

563
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.220
but you're still young.

564
00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.760
There's nothing left in my life...

565
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.260
except for making you successful.

566
00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.030
You need to go higher,

567
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:51.900
be happier,

568
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.700
and be prouder.

569
00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.240
Why would you leave a blemish?

570
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:02.710
I'll take care of all the unpleasant tasks,

571
00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.050
so don't worry about anything, and walk on the flower path.

572
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.550
Like now. Okay?

573
00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.080
Understand?

574
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.200
She's my daughter.

575
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:49.260
(Consensual divorce intention confirmation date)

576
00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.130
It's on Thursday.

577
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:59.620
Mom. Mom. What's going on?

578
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.890
Why are you home so early?

579
00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.550
You sounded sad.

580
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:06.340
Are you sick?

581
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.210
Sit down.

582
00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:25.270
What's going on?

583
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:26.760
Tell me.

584
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.400
Ru Ri.

585
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.470
I'm so sorry.

586
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:37.670
I was going to wait until you get married...

587
00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.380
in case you get criticized, but I can't take it anymore.

588
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.240
I'm so angry and stressed out...

589
00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.550
that if this continues, I'll die.

590
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.950
I can't do this anymore.

591
00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.670
What's wrong?

592
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:55.320
Did Dad say something?

593
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:02.260
What's going on? Tell me.

594
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.130
What's wrong?

595
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.130
Mom.

596
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:10.570
Ru Ri.

597
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.170
What am I going to do now?

598
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.280
Ru Ri. You have...

599
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.060
What is it?

600
00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.000
You have a younger sister.

601
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.400
A half-sister.

602
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:41.670
What?

603
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.510
A half-sister?

604
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:56.520
She eats a lot just like Ru Ri.

605
00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.990
Wait. No.

606
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:04.090
She's still my granddaughter.

607
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.690
I should raise her well.

608
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.900
Nowadays, it costs...

609
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.800
200,000 dollars to raise a child.

610
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.400
I should come up with a strategy.

611
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:23.510
(Working after retirement)

612
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.650
This is the answer.

613
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:38.760
Lifelong career development service?

614
00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.760
(Lifelong career development program)

615
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.240
I boiled nurungji for you.

616
00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.070
I know you didn't eat anything all day. Have some.

617
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.380
Do you want jangjorim?

618
00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.260
What's wrong? Do you have an upset stomach?

619
00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.260
Mom.

620
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:27.940
Are you okay, Mom?

621
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.140
You're sweating so much.

622
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.710
Your face is so pale, Mom.

623
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.550
I don't know why my chest feels so heavy.

624
00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:40.420
What's wrong with Dad?

625
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.760
Mom. Let's just move out together.

626
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.680
I have a job now. Let's find a place with cheap rent,

627
00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.200
and live on our own.

628
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.740
(Employment welfare center)

629
00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.740
(Elderly employment counseling)

630
00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.170
What field did you work in before?

631
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.280
I need to know your strengths and weaknesses before I help you.

632
00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:12.420
I worked for a construction company for 34 years.

633
00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.690
I retired as an executive.

634
00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:18.220
I'll lower my expectation.

635
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.980
Please help me find a job as soon as I can.

636
00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.130
Okay.

637
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:26.170
I'm in a rush...

638
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.970
to raise my young child.

639
00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.970
- Young child? - Yes.

640
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:32.840
I see.

641
00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:36.530
Let's focus on career development.

642
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:39.550
You can start with Lifelong Career Development.

643
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:50.260
I hope you can get reemployed after taking this class.

644
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:52.190
So...

645
00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.760
Please come in.

646
00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.900
Excuse me.

647
00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.600
Wait a moment.

648
00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.200
She must be your granddaughter,

649
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.780
but we don't allow children here.

650
00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.240
My granddaughter... I mean...

651
00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.520
My daughter is so young,

652
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.290
and I couldn't leave her alone.

653
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:10.980
- She's his daughter? - She's his daughter?

654
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.800
- She's your daughter? - Yes.

655
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:18.050
Oh, my. I respect you.

656
00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:22.040
Do you think we can let him and his little girl stay?

657
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.590
- Of course. - Of course.

658
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:27.480
You should sit over there.

659
00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.080
- You must still be strong. - I respect you.

660
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.530
You're really cool.

661
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.560
Today's the first class of this program.

662
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.390
We'll look back to our career in the past.

663
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:43.710
He's not my dad!

664
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.500
If I get reemployed,

665
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.100
I'll buy you everything you want.

666
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.320
So be quiet.

667
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.710
I'm sorry. Don't mind her.

668
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:57.260
Look here.

669
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.760
Today's topic is...

670
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:05.510
I'll take care of all unpleasant tasks,

671
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:08.830
so don't worry about anything, and walk on the flower path.

672
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:10.740
Like now.

673
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.240
Gosh, honey. Honey!

674
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.670
What are you doing? I know you're upset,

675
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:30.060
but this will ruin your stomach.

676
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:34.590
I feel like human trash.

677
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.460
Why would you say that?

678
00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.960
It was your father's fault.

679
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:43.040
I can't imagine how upset your mother must be.

680
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.960
If I were in her position, I'd have bitten my tongue...

681
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.110
and killed myself on the spot.

682
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:52.650
But did she actually say she'll accept the baby?

683
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.280
I mean, the child is so cute.

684
00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:01.700
That's why I want to ask you, Yeon Ju...

685
00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.710
What?

686
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.140
If... If...

687
00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.210
Yes?

688
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:09.630
If mom doesn't want to raise the child,

689
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.570
should we raise her?

690
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.150
Us?

691
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:16.970
It's difficult for you to get pregnant,

692
00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.110
and you think she's cute.

693
00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.960
No, I don't want to.

694
00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.240
It will ruin the family tree.

695
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.000
She'd be my sister-in-law and my daughter.

696
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.020
For you, she'd be your sister and daughter at the same time.

697
00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:33.670
Gosh, I don't know. It's so confusing.

698
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:37.320
And my mom will never allow it.

699
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.310
She's okay with everything else but not adopting someone.

700
00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:42.190
She'll make us get divorced.

701
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.870
Of course. You're right.

702
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.960
Is this your house?

703
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.560
I told you...

704
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.380
that you need to call me dad from now on.

705
00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.110
- Gosh. - Say it.

706
00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:01.610
"Dad."

707
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.220
"Dad."

708
00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.130
Even for you, it'll be hard to think of me as a dad.

709
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.700
If you go inside, you'll meet your grandmother.

710
00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:22.570
You need to behave in front of her.

711
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.470
You should practice greeting her.

712
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.510
Like this.

713
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.280
"Hello."

714
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.450
"This is a present for you."

715
00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.150
Try it.

716
00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.490
"Hello."

717
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:50.500
Gosh, you're so stubborn. I guess you have my blood after all.

718
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.400
Let's go.

719
00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.340
Mom.

720
00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.330
Where are you trying to go this late at night?

721
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.600
I'm so sick of him.

722
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.400
I don't want to see him anymore.

723
00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.080
No, I don't even want to breathe in the same room as him.

724
00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.320
I'll get a room somewhere.

725
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.570
Mom, in that case, just wait a moment.

726
00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:20.810
You shouldn't be alone.

727
00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:22.340
I'll go with you.

728
00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.810
Just wait a moment, okay?

729
00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:26.200
Honey. Honey!

730
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.070
I'm here, Mrs. Hong.

731
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.740
Dad's here.

732
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.250
You're here.

733
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:42.610
Oh, my.

734
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.190
My sweet daughter is home early.

735
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:52.760
It seems like you've already heard everything.

736
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:57.400
Well, it just happened.

737
00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:01.200
Anyway, well done.

738
00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:06.470
It would have been hard for me to explain everything to you.

739
00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:08.840
Well done.

740
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:13.780
Wait.

741
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.320
Come in.

742
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.920
Come here.

743
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:25.660
Is this her?

744
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.130
Yes.

745
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:30.460
She's... She's your sister.

746
00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.630
Han Gyul, say hello to your grandmother...

747
00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:39.420
I mean, your stepmother.

748
00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.510
Here.

749
00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:43.510
Good.

750
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.550
Dad!

751
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:03.400
Ru Ri, take her to your room.

752
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.400
- Mom. - Go.

753
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:11.670
Follow me.

754
00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:21.010
Gosh, they look like great sisters.

755
00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.420
It looked like...

756
00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.890
two friendly rabbits going out...

757
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:36.460
You don't even deserve to be human.

758
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:43.640
Honey. Honey.

759
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.290
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

760
00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:48.010
It was a mistake.

761
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:50.080
I will never make the same mistake again.

762
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.890
If you forgive me one last time,

763
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:55.330
I'll pull out all my hair if I need to.

764
00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:58.000
Please, I beg you. Just forgive me this once.

765
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.440
Please forgive me.

766
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.740
Let me go.

767
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.420
I can't. I won't.

768
00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.260
If I let you go, you'll go out.

769
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:08.760
You know me well.

770
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.050
I never had any women problems.

771
00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.420
I'm as pure and clean as the top of Mt. Halla.

772
00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.750
It was just once. It was just one mistake.

773
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:18.290
That's why this happened.

774
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:21.790
If you're jealous about her mother,

775
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:23.780
you don't need to worry about that.

776
00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:28.100
She's nothing compared to you.

777
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:31.470
It's something like a bird dropping to me.

778
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.320
It's the bird's fault, not mine.

779
00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:39.880
Yes, yes, that's how I feel.

780
00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.580
I'm so shocked, at a loss for words, and taken aback.

781
00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:46.800
So this is something that we can laugh away.

782
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:48.320
Lee Shin Mo.

783
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:53.440
I won't burden you by telling you to raise that child.

784
00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.330
I went to the Career Development Center...

785
00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:58.880
and a kindergarten today.

786
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.850
9 to 5.

787
00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:04.270
The kindergarten will look after the child from 9am to 5pm.

788
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:06.340
You don't need to worry.

789
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.300
- Listen to me. I don't want to... - No, no.

790
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.640
No, no, no, no, no, no.

791
00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.480
I will talk first. I will talk first.

792
00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:17.750
You're so shocked that you can't think rationally.

793
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:21.400
It's not that I want to raise her for my own good.

794
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:25.020
Don't you know how nice it would be for you to have a kid again?

795
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.690
It's the second chapter of your life.

796
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:29.020
You'll start again from the age of 60.

797
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.790
Thanks to the kid, we'll try to keep healthy,

798
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:33.600
be happier together,

799
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.920
and moreover, we'll be patriots in this hypofertile age.

800
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.540
It's been proven statistically.

801
00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.640
Women with late kids live younger.

802
00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.860
That's what happened to you.

803
00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.130
What? What is this?

804
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:03.560
Application for Divorce by Mutual Consent?

805
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.680
Do you remember that?

806
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.650
We went to court together.

807
00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:11.320
(Application for Divorce by Mutual Consent)

808
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.440
Did you bring your identification card?

809
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.940
We can't do it now, but...

810
00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.590
What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing?

811
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.760
Gosh, she's spiteful.

812
00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:25.800
It was a month ago.

813
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:29.670
It'll be at 2pm on Thursday. See you at the court.

814
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.170
Divorce?

815
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.810
Who said I'll divorce you?

816
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.140
I begged your forgiveness. I just didn't kneel down,

817
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.880
but I begged you as much as I can.

818
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.720
You're backstabbing me again?

819
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.550
Do you think a divorce is that easy?

820
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:51.960
Fine. Try getting a divorce then.

821
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:56.130
I'm never going to divorce you. No matter what.

822
00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:01.800
Divorce by consent won't happen if I don't show up.

823
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:05.550
No matter how many times you request,

824
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:09.610
I'm never going to show up.

825
00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.280
Is that so? Then I'll sue you.

826
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.420
Sue me? You think that's easy?

827
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.490
It could take up to five years.

828
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:23.710
If you want to be a divorced woman even when you're old,

829
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:25.520
go ahead.

830
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.190
Why are you doing this to me?

831
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:32.560
Why won't you divorce me even after all this?

832
00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.530
You still don't know?

833
00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:37.400
Do you seriously not know?

834
00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.010
Do you seriously not know how I feel?

835
00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.150
Because I love you.

836
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:53.720
Because I love you forever.

837
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.250
Please stop, Dad.

838
00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:01.260
Dad. What you're doing isn't love.

839
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.260
Mom said she can't stand it.

840
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.800
Mom said she's going to die.

841
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.400
Look at Mom.

842
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:08.780
Look at Mom.

843
00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.740
Look at her if you have eyes.

844
00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.610
Why is it...

845
00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.210
It's all because of you.

846
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.880
It's because she's stressed.

847
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:24.650
Fester and scab. Fester and scab. That's how she lived until now.

848
00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:27.550
Why are you doing this to Mom?

849
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:30.110
Why would you bug Mom so much?

850
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:31.860
Don't you feel sorry?

851
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.710
Don't you feel pity for her?

852
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:35.590
Why would you be like this?

853
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:42.230
Mom. Mom. Mom.

854
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:44.940
- Mom. Mom. - Honey.

855
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.510
- Mom. - Honey.

856
00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:49.610
Honey. Young Hye.

857
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:50.880
- Mom. - What's wrong?

858
00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:53.100
- Mom. - What's wrong with her?

859
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.730
Honey. Honey. Young Hye.

860
00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:56.310
Honey. Honey.

861
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.620
Are you disappointed in me?

862
00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.260
Honestly...

863
00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:10.500
I'm shocked.

864
00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:20.510
Mom. Dad said to come outside.

865
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:21.860
Why?

866
00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.380
I don't know. He looked serious.

867
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.120
Now, for our beloved Jung Hwa Young,

868
00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.730
we'll sing for you.

869
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:52.200
Since you're so down today,

870
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.940
cheer up listening to your favorite song.

871
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:05.000
I always miss you my dear

872
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.820
Where have you gone

873
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:15.130
to Your warmth left current of tears

874
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:19.160
Dear, come back to me

875
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:25.470
Come back dear, come back to me

876
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:30.010
I think only of you

877
00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:37.820
You can't avoid my fiery love

878
00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.790
Dear, come back

879
00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:45.620
To me

880
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:55.570
Aren't they beautiful?

881
00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:57.970
I'm really lucky.

882
00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:02.710
Tae Yang. Woo Joo. Eun Byul.

883
00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.880
I have the whole universe.

884
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:08.380
Someone as lucky like me...

885
00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:11.220
must try harder than I did.

886
00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.990
You asked me if I was disappointed, right?

887
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.420
I'll love you more...

888
00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.690
than before I knew you.

889
00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.400
Honey.

890
00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.970
They say most precious thing in the world...

891
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.740
is the old wife who has spent her youth with you.

892
00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.340
Let's...

893
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:41.950
get old together.

894
00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:49.220
Come here.

895
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:52.760
Me too.

896
00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:44.610
What?

897
00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:47.380
Who is she?

898
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:51.220
Right. She's Ru Ri's half-sister.

899
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:54.820
She asked me to babysit her. I guess she hasn't come back yet.

900
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:56.990
What am I going to do?

901
00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.320
I need to go to the army.

902
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.960
Healthy food for liver.

903
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.070
What's good for the base?

904
01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:16.440
Why are you calling so early in the morning?

905
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.410
I'm in trouble, Manager Jung.

906
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:20.780
Ru Ri might not make it to work today.

907
01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.320
It's her first day at headquarters. Is something wrong?

908
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:28.320
She cried so much last night.

909
01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.920
Her mom collapsed.

910
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.620
What?

911
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:34.860
Which hospital is she at?

912
01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.270
Honey. Wake up. Honey.

913
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.580
Honey.

914
01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.550
Are you okay, Mom?

915
01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.420
How do you feel?

916
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.220
Honey. Honey.

917
01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:05.690
You don't need to worry. I'm right here. Honey.

918
01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.030
Get out.

919
01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:10.630
- Get out. Get out. - Mom.

920
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.350
- Get out. - Honey, calm down.

921
01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:15.780
It's me.

922
01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.620
Ru Ri. Tell your dad to leave.

923
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.660
- Calm down, Mom. - Get out.

924
01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.890
- Calm down. - Mom.

925
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.730
Honey. It's me.

926
01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:25.340
- It's me. - Excuse me.

927
01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.230
It's fine. Calm down.

928
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:29.360
Everyone, please leave.

929
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.650
The patient needs to stay calm. Hurry.

930
01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:59.540
Sir. We need to talk.

931
01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.030
It's pretty serious.

932
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:19.200
Why? Are the test results bad?

933
01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.930
Is my wife suffering from a serious disease?

934
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.240
That's not it.

935
01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.110
I think she needs to see a psychiatrist.

936
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:28.910
Psychiatrist?

937
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:33.750
Is there something wrong...

938
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:36.610
with her mentality?

939
01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.550
That's not it.

940
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.540
Her veins are fine according to the test,

941
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:45.260
but she collapsed because her frontal heart isn't moving.

942
01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.310
What does that mean?

943
01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:51.250
Has she ever said she has a trouble breathing...

944
01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:53.160
or feels suffocated?

945
01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:54.800
She did.

946
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.790
I always reprimanded her saying that its due to lack of exercise.

947
01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:01.670
Anyway, I'll talk to the psychiatrist.

948
01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.180
Thank you.

949
01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.850
What was all that about?

950
01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:12.220
Why would he make her sound like a crazy woman?

951
01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.590
Gosh.
