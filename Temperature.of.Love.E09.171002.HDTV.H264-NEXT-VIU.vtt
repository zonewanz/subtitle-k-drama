1
00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:10.458
I heard they called the contest winners today.

2
00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:13.057
I got a call.

3
00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:14.698
So you were selected?

4
00:00:15.127 --> 00:00:16.128
Yes.

5
00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:18.697
Why are you telling me this now? I feel embarrassed.

6
00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:21.168
I told you already. I'm okay.

7
00:00:21.168 --> 00:00:22.438
I'm still young.

8
00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:24.208
Congratulations.

9
00:00:38.887 --> 00:00:39.887
Hey, Hong Ah.

10
00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:41.257
Come to Seoul.

11
00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:43.488
I need to hang out with someone I can take my anger out on.

12
00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:45.058
Okay.

13
00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:55.238
Hong Ah, I was just about to leave.

14
00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:57.168
Why are you so foolishly nice?

15
00:00:57.338 --> 00:00:58.738
Why would you come just because I tell you to?

16
00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:01.437
You're so easy to use.

17
00:01:01.738 --> 00:01:03.208
I'm only like this to you.

18
00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:05.147
Have you already started taking your anger out on me?

19
00:01:05.507 --> 00:01:06.748
Why do you like me?

20
00:01:07.447 --> 00:01:10.147
There'd be no misery if people had a reason for liking someone.

21
00:01:11.848 --> 00:01:12.848
I want to be alone.

22
00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:14.917
Is there something wrong?

23
00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:17.488
I failed the contest.

24
00:01:18.757 --> 00:01:20.057
You can enter it again.

25
00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:22.328
You have a knack for making people angry.

26
00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.598
It'll do well as long as you melt in your personality in your writing.

27
00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:28.298
Did you mean that as a consolation or a compliment?

28
00:01:28.998 --> 00:01:30.037
It's just me being pitiful...

29
00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:32.667
by trying hard to impress you even in this kind of situation.

30
00:01:42.447 --> 00:01:43.447
It's okay.

31
00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:45.917
It's no big deal that I failed the contest.

32
00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:10.548
What are you going to do after you graduate?

33
00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:12.407
I'm just going to have fun.

34
00:02:12.747 --> 00:02:14.078
My parents are rich.

35
00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:15.877
- My gosh. - My gosh.

36
00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:17.048
How impressive.

37
00:02:17.418 --> 00:02:19.448
There's a restaurant nearby that sells delicious steamed seafood.

38
00:02:19.448 --> 00:02:20.557
- Do you want to go with us? - Won Joon.

39
00:02:21.888 --> 00:02:22.918
Let's go.

40
00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:25.127
Bye, you guys.

41
00:02:28.557 --> 00:02:30.027
It's not a big deal that you failed the contest.

42
00:02:30.268 --> 00:02:32.127
You know that it's not easy to become a writer.

43
00:02:35.497 --> 00:02:37.508
I finally know why I feel so miserable.

44
00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.508
Hyun Soo passed the contest,

45
00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:44.177
and that bothers me more than the fact that I failed.

46
00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:48.448
That shows what a loser I am.

47
00:02:49.988 --> 00:02:51.018
And I'm miserable...

48
00:02:51.948 --> 00:02:53.018
for being a loser.

49
00:03:04.668 --> 00:03:05.668
This is so nice.

50
00:03:05.997 --> 00:03:08.038
It must feel nice. You passed the contest,

51
00:03:08.038 --> 00:03:09.738
which means you're going to debut and become a writer.

52
00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:13.478
I meant it feels nice to be able to treat you to a meal here.

53
00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:17.377
You still remember that?

54
00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:20.418
Of course. Back when I felt down after failing the contest,

55
00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:23.247
you offered to treat me to a meal here.

56
00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:26.087
I was really grateful for your gesture back then.

57
00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:32.988
I didn't know you ate here.

58
00:03:33.557 --> 00:03:34.997
- Hello. - Hi, Ms. Lee.

59
00:03:35.557 --> 00:03:37.367
I saw the drama. Did you like it?

60
00:03:37.527 --> 00:03:39.967
Yes, I think I was the worst.

61
00:03:40.168 --> 00:03:42.097
The director and actors all did a very good job.

62
00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:44.937
My gosh, you're too humble. Are you being pretentious right now?

63
00:03:45.168 --> 00:03:47.177
I'd love it if she was from time to time.

64
00:03:47.538 --> 00:03:49.008
She signed a contract with my company.

65
00:03:49.238 --> 00:03:51.907
Really? Treat her well. She passed the contest this year.

66
00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:55.018
Let's go now. We should let them enjoy their meals.

67
00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:57.617
- Enjoy your meals. - You too.

68
00:03:59.288 --> 00:04:00.418
I'll pay for your table.

69
00:04:00.888 --> 00:04:02.988
Don't refuse. I'll get angry if you do.

70
00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:13.997
I should be the one to pay.

71
00:04:14.597 --> 00:04:17.268
Today's meal doesn't count. I'll buy you a nice meal next time.

72
00:04:17.737 --> 00:04:19.777
He's head over heels for you.

73
00:04:20.438 --> 00:04:22.808
I'm jealous that you're dating the CEO of a management company.

74
00:04:23.647 --> 00:04:25.078
We're not dating.

75
00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:26.678
You said he proposed to you.

76
00:04:26.948 --> 00:04:28.318
Plus, you even signed a contract.

77
00:04:29.178 --> 00:04:31.647
Wouldn't you call him the perfect prince?

78
00:04:31.748 --> 00:04:33.717
Well, I'm not Cinderella.

79
00:04:34.618 --> 00:04:36.188
And I had no choice but to sign a contract with him.

80
00:04:36.657 --> 00:04:38.157
He's the first person to have acknowledged my skills.

81
00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.628
This isn't a matter of man and woman.

82
00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:45.597
That's how love always begins.

83
00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:49.198
I loved her although she rejected me.

84
00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:55.277
Of course she'd reject you.

85
00:04:55.508 --> 00:04:58.448
It doesn't make sense for you two to be together.

86
00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:01.147
She's dating a guy that's a big shot right now.

87
00:05:01.147 --> 00:05:02.977
He's older than her,

88
00:05:02.977 --> 00:05:04.347
richer, and handsome. He only cares about her.

89
00:05:04.347 --> 00:05:07.018
He's the perfect guy any woman would want.

90
00:05:09.487 --> 00:05:10.857
Why aren't you saying anything?

91
00:05:12.058 --> 00:05:13.357
Are you in shock?

92
00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.428
I was prepared for this.

93
00:05:16.928 --> 00:05:18.797
She's pretty and nice.

94
00:05:19.498 --> 00:05:21.397
There's no way she'd stay single for long.

95
00:05:21.797 --> 00:05:25.068
I'm the one who always hears that I'm too pretty and nice...

96
00:05:25.068 --> 00:05:26.938
to stay single for long.

97
00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:30.508
Hyun Soo is more of the plain and modest type.

98
00:05:32.107 --> 00:05:34.047
You're pretty confident about your looks.

99
00:05:34.078 --> 00:05:36.078
I never thought you're pretty.

100
00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:39.547
You're the first man to treat me this bad.

101
00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:43.128
But I don't mind it. It makes me feel comfortable.

102
00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:45.428
Do you want to go out with me?

103
00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:48.128
What?

104
00:05:48.128 --> 00:05:51.368
You and I have a lot of similarities.

105
00:05:52.928 --> 00:05:54.967
You really like me.

106
00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:57.938
We're not similar at all.

107
00:06:01.438 --> 00:06:03.448
Go out with someone who makes your heart race.

108
00:06:03.808 --> 00:06:05.078
I'm not the one for you.

109
00:06:05.808 --> 00:06:07.618
Is it because of Hyun Soo?

110
00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:10.717
I told you she has a boyfriend.

111
00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:13.518
Just because she's going out with someone else,

112
00:06:13.688 --> 00:06:15.587
that doesn't mean I should date another woman.

113
00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:19.458
How could you be so mean to me?

114
00:06:20.998 --> 00:06:22.797
If a girl asks you out first,

115
00:06:22.797 --> 00:06:25.198
shouldn't you at least pretend to think about it?

116
00:06:26.268 --> 00:06:28.537
How could you be so firm in rejecting me?

117
00:06:28.797 --> 00:06:31.868
You have to be firm, especially between a man and woman.

118
00:06:31.868 --> 00:06:34.977
Good for you. What a jerk.

119
00:06:36.078 --> 00:06:37.477
Why are you two fighting?

120
00:06:37.477 --> 00:06:38.578
Hi Won Joon.

121
00:06:38.808 --> 00:06:40.318
I made my decision.

122
00:06:40.318 --> 00:06:42.578
Once I finish my military service, I'm going to become a chef.

123
00:06:43.748 --> 00:06:46.018
Do you think dreams come true that easily?

(Script by Lee Hyun Soo)

126
00:07:07.008 --> 00:07:09.907
With the shared goal of becoming a TV drama writer,

127
00:07:10.678 --> 00:07:12.977
Hong Ah and I shared a lot of time and emotions together.

128
00:07:13.948 --> 00:07:15.477
I loved Hong Ah.

("Unruly Detectives")

130
00:07:19.248 --> 00:07:23.328
I don't want to know why Hong Ah became hostile against me.

131
00:07:24.258 --> 00:07:25.888
Some things simply reveal themselves in time...

132
00:07:27.027 --> 00:07:29.357
even when you don't want to know what they are.

00:07:33.837 --> 00:07:34.837
(2017)

135
00:07:34.837 --> 00:07:36.708
Did you forget that you didn't pick up my call?

136
00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:38.107
How can I forget?

137
00:07:38.107 --> 00:07:41.107
Do you know how much I regretted it, and how much it hurt?

138
00:07:42.107 --> 00:07:44.008
Why did you regret it, and why were you hurt?

139
00:07:46.178 --> 00:07:47.518
You have a big shot boyfriend,

140
00:07:47.518 --> 00:07:50.217
and your dream of becoming a writer came true.

141
00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:52.547
Why did you regret it, and why were you hurt?

142
00:07:58.188 --> 00:07:59.527
Why are you still outside?

143
00:08:06.438 --> 00:08:08.167
A stranger might think...

144
00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:10.467
that you're having a couple's quarrel.

145
00:08:16.337 --> 00:08:18.547
This is my favorite man.

146
00:08:18.607 --> 00:08:20.047
So cheesy.

147
00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.248
This is my favorite woman.

148
00:08:23.347 --> 00:08:26.018
Since I'm with my two favorite people,

149
00:08:27.018 --> 00:08:28.357
I feel great.

150
00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:33.497
Let's go inside.

151
00:08:45.938 --> 00:08:47.308
Thank you.

152
00:08:53.178 --> 00:08:54.178
How is it?

153
00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:56.318
It's nice.

154
00:08:56.387 --> 00:08:58.347
Don't give me terse answers.

155
00:08:58.347 --> 00:09:00.587
Add some adjectives to describe how you feel.

156
00:09:00.587 --> 00:09:03.017
You're a writer but all you say is "it's nice" or "it's not nice".

157
00:09:05.227 --> 00:09:07.028
Well, it's nice.

158
00:09:10.127 --> 00:09:12.528
Gosh, he has a new woman again.

159
00:09:12.528 --> 00:09:15.237
It's because of guys like you that rumors fly around.

160
00:09:15.237 --> 00:09:17.438
She's not a girlfriend. She's a business client.

161
00:09:17.438 --> 00:09:20.007
You're always so protective of him.

162
00:09:20.007 --> 00:09:22.877
Are you doing this so that he'll invest in your own place?

163
00:09:22.877 --> 00:09:25.908
You watch too much TV. Now you're writing your own drama?

164
00:09:25.908 --> 00:09:27.818
You two can't be together for not even a minute.

165
00:09:27.818 --> 00:09:29.377
But who's he?

166
00:09:29.377 --> 00:09:31.448
He kind of looks like a gigolo?

167
00:09:31.448 --> 00:09:33.318
He's a CEO? CEO of what?

168
00:09:33.318 --> 00:09:35.117
Our boy here has no filter.

169
00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:36.357
You must have gotten beaten up a lot.

170
00:09:36.357 --> 00:09:38.587
You look like you're from the US,

171
00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:41.727
but your words are so cheap and old school, Cutie Pie.

172
00:09:41.727 --> 00:09:43.127
Stop it. That's gross.

173
00:09:43.127 --> 00:09:44.727
Cutie Pie, why are you grossed out?

174
00:09:44.727 --> 00:09:46.367
Do you want me to scold him? Who did it?

175
00:09:46.367 --> 00:09:48.767
You two just love picking on the youngster, don't you?

176
00:09:48.767 --> 00:09:51.237
- Okay, okay. - My goodness.

177
00:09:51.438 --> 00:09:53.607
Stop watching and go back to your stations.

178
00:09:53.607 --> 00:09:54.708
They're our first dinner guests.

179
00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:56.178
- Yes, Chef. - Yes, Chef.

180
00:10:00.977 --> 00:10:02.078
Let's have a word.

181
00:10:04.448 --> 00:10:06.347
Where did you meet Hyun Soo?

182
00:10:06.487 --> 00:10:07.688
In front of here.

183
00:10:08.257 --> 00:10:09.757
She didn't you avoid you this time?

184
00:10:09.857 --> 00:10:11.328
She couldn't.

185
00:10:11.328 --> 00:10:14.458
Jung Woo was right there. She had nowhere to run.

186
00:10:15.227 --> 00:10:17.428
How do Mr. Park and Hyun Soo know each other?

187
00:10:18.497 --> 00:10:20.038
It's probably the same as me.

188
00:10:20.038 --> 00:10:21.637
Contractor and contracted.

189
00:10:23.107 --> 00:10:24.337
What did she say to you?

190
00:10:24.607 --> 00:10:26.107
Why did she run away?

191
00:10:26.267 --> 00:10:28.808
Didn't she run from you because she still has feelings for you?

192
00:10:28.877 --> 00:10:30.477
You didn't hear what Hong Ah said?

193
00:10:30.778 --> 00:10:32.107
She has a boyfriend,

194
00:10:32.107 --> 00:10:34.148
and it looks like they'll get married too.

195
00:10:34.818 --> 00:10:38.387
Apparently she's happy as if she has the world in her hands.

196
00:10:39.717 --> 00:10:40.818
I have to protect her.

197
00:10:40.818 --> 00:10:42.757
That's just what Hong Ah said.

198
00:10:42.918 --> 00:10:45.087
You didn't hear that from Hyun Soo herself.

199
00:10:45.558 --> 00:10:47.727
She says she barely sees Hyun Soo now.

200
00:10:47.727 --> 00:10:49.627
Things may have changed.

201
00:10:49.627 --> 00:10:51.627
It's a fact that she rejected me.

202
00:10:51.627 --> 00:10:54.568
I'm the past for Hyun Soo, and it's the same for me.

203
00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:56.967
We weren't meant to be.

204
00:10:57.337 --> 00:10:59.107
But you still have feelings for her.

205
00:11:02.708 --> 00:11:06.078
Right now, I'm in charge of everyone at Good Soup.

206
00:11:06.078 --> 00:11:09.347
It's been eight months since we opened but we're at a deficit.

207
00:11:13.487 --> 00:11:16.928
Mr. Park is strict in separating his private life from work.

208
00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:20.698
After the first investment year, he'll fire a couple employees.

209
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:22.727
Since he won't be able to fire you.

210
00:11:22.727 --> 00:11:25.168
He can do much more than that.

211
00:11:25.867 --> 00:11:27.568
If you go on TV,

212
00:11:27.568 --> 00:11:30.308
people will talk about you and Good Soup will become famous.

213
00:11:30.867 --> 00:11:32.068
But you don't want to, right?

214
00:11:32.507 --> 00:11:35.737
I don't want to get attention for anything other than cooking.

215
00:11:36.078 --> 00:11:37.877
You're very firm.

216
00:11:38.747 --> 00:11:40.347
Does Hyun Soo know?

217
00:11:40.578 --> 00:11:43.387
You went on TV despite being such a purist...

218
00:11:43.387 --> 00:11:45.017
only because of her.

219
00:11:45.017 --> 00:11:46.788
I wanted to be supportive.

220
00:11:46.788 --> 00:11:49.257
I didn't have any other intentions, so don't make things up.

221
00:11:49.987 --> 00:11:52.058
Good Soup is all I care about right now.

222
00:11:52.528 --> 00:11:55.097
Why don't people appreciate fine dining?

223
00:11:55.257 --> 00:11:57.767
They spend hundreds of dollars in barbecue places.

224
00:11:57.767 --> 00:12:00.398
Those complaints are only for amateurs.

225
00:12:00.398 --> 00:12:03.408
We haven't been able to impress people with our food.

226
00:12:03.408 --> 00:12:04.708
We have to try harder.

227
00:12:05.607 --> 00:12:06.678
Yes, Chef.

228
00:12:08.808 --> 00:12:11.408
Bring me the herb powder I ground last night.

229
00:12:11.408 --> 00:12:12.607
It's at my place.

230
00:12:17.048 --> 00:12:18.788
Here is your mushroom tart.

231
00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:21.658
You have to leave a record of these things.

232
00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.528
Tell Chef On to come out here.

233
00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.087
Yes, sir.

234
00:12:33.337 --> 00:12:35.038
(Dinner Course Menu)

235
00:12:35.767 --> 00:12:39.038
Mushroom tart. How does it taste?

236
00:12:48.678 --> 00:12:49.678
It's nice.

237
00:12:50.587 --> 00:12:52.087
Don't tease me.

238

("Unruly Detectives")

239
00:13:03.668 --> 00:13:04.798
"Unruly Detectives".

240
00:13:07.837 --> 00:13:09.808
("Unruly Detectives")

241
00:13:11.538 --> 00:13:12.538
What?

242
00:13:12.538 --> 00:13:13.938
(Assistant Writer Ji Hong Ah)

243
00:13:14.607 --> 00:13:16.578
Hong Ah was the assistant writer?

244
00:13:22.178 --> 00:13:23.548
Do you want some ramyeon before you go?

245
00:13:23.948 --> 00:13:25.017
Sure.

246
00:13:28.418 --> 00:13:29.487
You never cook,

247
00:13:29.487 --> 00:13:31.958
but you never refuse when offered.

248
00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.097
Did you ask hoping I'd refuse?

249
00:13:34.497 --> 00:13:37.467
No. I was just wondering if everyone had a set fate.

250
00:13:38.367 --> 00:13:41.568
You're used to having others do everything for you.

251
00:13:42.038 --> 00:13:43.507
But ever since I was born,

252
00:13:43.507 --> 00:13:45.967
I had to do everything for myself if I wanted to live.

253
00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:48.737
I'm practically your maid when we're together.

254
00:13:49.308 --> 00:13:51.208
But in the end, we're both assistants.

255
00:13:51.648 --> 00:13:53.918
What's better about my life than yours?

256
00:13:54.477 --> 00:13:55.548
You're right.

257
00:13:56.148 --> 00:13:58.087
I'm the more miserable one.

258
00:13:58.188 --> 00:14:00.188
I was born with so much more than you.

259
00:14:00.188 --> 00:14:01.587
But now we're the same.

260
00:14:02.387 --> 00:14:03.887
You're right.

261
00:14:04.158 --> 00:14:06.058
That makes me feel better.

262
00:14:06.328 --> 00:14:07.898
Enjoy the ramyeon.

263
00:14:07.898 --> 00:14:10.267
I suddenly feel terrible.

264
00:14:15.038 --> 00:14:16.867
(Won Joon)

265
00:14:18.837 --> 00:14:19.977
What's up?

266
00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:22.178
You were Hyun Soo's assistant?

267
00:14:30.887 --> 00:14:32.117
How did you find out?

268
00:14:33.158 --> 00:14:34.357
We need to talk.

269
00:14:38.428 --> 00:14:39.458
What was that?

270
00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:40.928
Who called?

271
00:14:43.997 --> 00:14:47.497
Hyun Soo's having dinner with the chief producer after their meeting.

272
00:14:47.867 --> 00:14:50.068
- She's quite the saleswoman. - "Saleswoman"?

273
00:14:50.708 --> 00:14:52.867
You're talking nonsense again.

274
00:15:03.217 --> 00:15:04.617
I've known you for five years,

275
00:15:05.617 --> 00:15:06.887
and you really haven't changed.

276
00:15:07.158 --> 00:15:08.587
You're happy even when knocked down.

277
00:15:10.357 --> 00:15:13.227
What else can I do? I still need to live.

278
00:15:13.458 --> 00:15:14.597
Yes, you're right.

279
00:15:18.928 --> 00:15:19.967
Is it okay?

280
00:15:21.168 --> 00:15:22.767
- What are you talking about? - The food.

281
00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:26.208
You should be asking Ms. Lee, not me.

282
00:15:26.367 --> 00:15:27.678
Today's her first time eating here.

283
00:15:30.778 --> 00:15:31.877
It tastes delicious.

284
00:15:33.117 --> 00:15:34.117
I'm relieved to hear that.

285
00:15:35.578 --> 00:15:36.788
Why are you talking to me so politely all of a sudden?

286
00:15:38.747 --> 00:15:40.087
You're the one who started it.

287
00:15:43.288 --> 00:15:44.688
What's wrong with you two?

288
00:15:45.227 --> 00:15:46.727
Why are you guys so hostile towards each other?

289
00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:48.558
Do you have something to say to me?

290
00:15:49.528 --> 00:15:50.967
No, come sit down.

291
00:15:51.597 --> 00:15:54.538
I can't sit with a customer during working hours. It's etiquette.

292
00:15:54.698 --> 00:15:56.038
It's nice to see you emphasize on that...

293
00:15:56.267 --> 00:15:57.908
even when we're so close.

294
00:15:57.908 --> 00:15:59.267
You should put more emphasis on that too.

295
00:15:59.607 --> 00:16:01.237
Why did you call me over when you have nothing to say?

296
00:16:02.038 --> 00:16:03.648
I apologize, Chef On.

297
00:16:03.948 --> 00:16:07.178
I must've mistook you for a close friend, not a chef.

298
00:16:07.178 --> 00:16:10.288
Oh, is that so? Then I'll be off now.

299
00:16:19.288 --> 00:16:21.658
Should we start talking about work now?

300
00:16:22.627 --> 00:16:24.028
Are we going to talk about the script?

301
00:16:24.528 --> 00:16:25.528
No.

302
00:16:26.097 --> 00:16:27.967
I don't want to talk about anything else other than the script.

303
00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:30.408
You can handle business matters.

304
00:16:31.038 --> 00:16:33.308
Writers don't only write scripts these days.

305
00:16:33.837 --> 00:16:35.107
They also need to learn how to do business.

306
00:16:36.038 --> 00:16:39.347
But if you sign a lifetime contract with me, you won't need to.

307
00:16:40.648 --> 00:16:41.747
What do you say?

308
00:16:44.448 --> 00:16:45.788
Do you know the name of this wine?

309
00:16:53.798 --> 00:16:54.798
Is it ready?

310
00:16:55.727 --> 00:16:56.767
Yes, Chef.

311
00:17:02.337 --> 00:17:03.938
You plated it wrong. Give me the cooking tweezer.

312
00:17:16.517 --> 00:17:19.047
Where did Won Joon leave to after giving me the herb powder?

313
00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:21.217
He said he's going to go meet a school friend.

314
00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:22.987
It's working hours right now. What school friend?

315
00:17:23.557 --> 00:17:26.428
There aren't even any customers. He probably just went...

316
00:17:33.668 --> 00:17:35.698
We're still going to do our jobs whether we have customers or not.

317
00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.007
- Yes, Chef. - Yes, Chef.

318
00:17:48.848 --> 00:17:49.848
That was quick.

319
00:17:51.388 --> 00:17:52.618
Don't be sarcastic.

320
00:17:53.287 --> 00:17:55.658
Don't act as if you know my weakness too.

321
00:17:56.787 --> 00:17:58.658
Is being Hyun Soo's assistant writer...

322
00:17:59.188 --> 00:18:01.698
that big of a deal to call it your weakness?

323
00:18:03.628 --> 00:18:04.868

Does Jung Sun know as well?

Are you scared that he might?

327

Yes.

328

It's better for him to not know that I'm the bad girl.

329
00:18:27.257 --> 00:18:28.817
Do you even think of what you did as bad?

330
00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.327
No.

331
00:18:31.428 --> 00:18:33.757
People might think that way,

332
00:18:33.928 --> 00:18:35.527
but all I did was just keep quiet.

333
00:18:36.057 --> 00:18:37.497
It's not like I ever lied about it.

334
00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:40.598
You talked as if you rarely get to meet Hyun Soo.

335
00:18:40.598 --> 00:18:42.168
And we understood it that way.

336
00:18:43.108 --> 00:18:45.138
You even talked as if she was going to get married soon.

337
00:18:46.577 --> 00:18:47.777
So it is a bad thing.

338
00:18:47.977 --> 00:18:49.878
Did anyone suffer a loss from what I said?

339
00:18:50.807 --> 00:18:52.678
Did I harm anyone by saying that?

340
00:18:53.577 --> 00:18:55.118
I'm going to tell Jung Sun about this.

341
00:18:57.547 --> 00:19:00.487
You know that Jung Sun and Hyun Soo used to like each other.

342
00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:03.287
I was embarrassed!

343
00:19:06.428 --> 00:19:09.767
Hyun Soo and I started out studying to become a writer together.

344
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.027
I fail at every contest I enter.

345
00:19:14.967 --> 00:19:16.267
Hyun Soo suggested it first.

346
00:19:17.267 --> 00:19:18.868
She said if I see the process of a drama production,

347
00:19:18.868 --> 00:19:21.438
it'll help me with my writing. She asked if I was interested.

348
00:19:22.938 --> 00:19:24.807
And I wanted to do...

349
00:19:26.108 --> 00:19:27.148
whatever I could...

350
00:19:28.017 --> 00:19:29.787
to become a writer.

351
00:19:31.348 --> 00:19:32.618
But this is still wrong.

352
00:19:32.618 --> 00:19:33.817
How could I tell him that...

353
00:19:35.487 --> 00:19:36.858
I'm working for...

354
00:19:37.257 --> 00:19:39.588
the woman who he used to love?

355
00:19:40.198 --> 00:19:41.797
How was I supposed to tell him that,

356
00:19:45.797 --> 00:19:47.567
when he's the guy I want to be with?

357
00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:57.823
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E09 Temperature of Love "I Regretted It"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

358
00:20:05.418 --> 00:20:06.888
Please just turn a blind eye.

359
00:20:15.527 --> 00:20:16.628
You're a fool.

360
00:20:18.497 --> 00:20:20.138
You're a fool for me.

361
00:20:39.388 --> 00:20:40.557
(Joon Ha)

362
00:20:43.188 --> 00:20:44.188
Yes?

363
00:20:45.458 --> 00:20:46.557
Are you okay?

364
00:20:47.327 --> 00:20:48.358
Are you drunk?

365
00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:51.297
Yes, I had a drink.

366
00:20:53.898 --> 00:20:56.198
I came to Hyun Soo's office, but she's not here.

367
00:20:56.507 --> 00:20:57.507
Is she...

368
00:21:02.077 --> 00:21:04.507
Jung Woo, Yi Bok said he wants me...

369
00:21:04.507 --> 00:21:07.477
to help his main staff with the drama shoot. What should I do?

370
00:21:07.678 --> 00:21:09.948
Say you'll do it. If you join the crew,

371
00:21:10.517 --> 00:21:12.217
Hyun Soo will feel reassured.

372
00:21:14.017 --> 00:21:15.057
But...

373
00:21:16.287 --> 00:21:18.487
Yi Bok just hired another writer.

374
00:21:18.787 --> 00:21:21.497
I'm not supposed to tell you this, but I feel so bad for Hyun Soo.

375
00:21:22.158 --> 00:21:23.827
He hired another writer?

376
00:21:27.368 --> 00:21:28.438
Okay.

377
00:21:29.198 --> 00:21:31.138
Director Min sure is dramatic.

378
00:21:36.747 --> 00:21:37.807
It's nothing.

379
00:21:38.448 --> 00:21:40.418
We should call it night, and get back to work.

380
00:21:41.077 --> 00:21:42.118
Okay.

381
00:21:43.618 --> 00:21:44.648
Cheer up.

382
00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:53.327
You too, Mr. Park.

383
00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:05.438
I'm going to sleep at my house tonight.

384
00:22:05.668 --> 00:22:07.178
I'll drive you to your place then.

385
00:22:07.438 --> 00:22:09.577
It's close enough for me to walk.

386
00:22:10.807 --> 00:22:13.277
I want to walk by myself, and clear my head.

387
00:22:14.747 --> 00:22:15.747
Okay, then.

388
00:22:16.047 --> 00:22:17.088
Bye.

389
00:22:17.317 --> 00:22:18.388
You go first.

390
00:22:19.717 --> 00:22:20.717
Okay.

391
00:22:26.287 --> 00:22:27.297
My gosh, my back.

392
00:22:33.027 --> 00:22:34.338
Good work, everyone.

393
00:22:34.338 --> 00:22:35.368
Thank you.

394
00:22:35.737 --> 00:22:37.467
- Min Ho. - Yes?

395
00:22:37.608 --> 00:22:38.608
How's work treating you?

396
00:22:38.668 --> 00:22:41.007
I've never given up on something I already decided to do.

397
00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:43.747
That's pretty impressive.

398
00:22:44.477 --> 00:22:45.747
Give me 10 dollars.

399
00:22:46.047 --> 00:22:47.118
What's with you guys?

400
00:22:47.477 --> 00:22:49.217
Ha Sung bet me 10 dollars...

401
00:22:49.517 --> 00:22:51.487
that Min Ho will end up quitting...

402
00:22:51.487 --> 00:22:53.088
in less than a week.

403
00:22:54.358 --> 00:22:56.217
- Then I guess this is mine. - Hey!

404
00:22:56.217 --> 00:22:57.757
- Run, Min Ho! - Hey!

405
00:22:58.588 --> 00:22:59.588
Hong Ah.

406
00:23:00.158 --> 00:23:02.227
Hong Ah, long time no see.

407
00:23:02.898 --> 00:23:03.967
Hey, you guys.

408
00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:06.497
Who's this? Is he a new recruit?

409
00:23:06.497 --> 00:23:08.438
Who said you could treat me like your friend?

410
00:23:09.037 --> 00:23:11.767
Don't mind him. He might be gone next week.

411
00:23:11.767 --> 00:23:13.277
What are you talking about?

412
00:23:13.277 --> 00:23:15.438
You really have no sense of humor.

413
00:23:15.438 --> 00:23:17.507
Stop it. I told you not to get too close like a girl.

414
00:23:17.507 --> 00:23:20.217
- I won't allow you to be rude. - It's hot.

415
00:23:20.217 --> 00:23:21.817
Guess what I got for you guys?

416
00:23:23.588 --> 00:23:26.517
Why isn't she coming? I asked her to join us.

417
00:23:26.517 --> 00:23:29.088
You're beautiful inside and out, Hong Ah.

418
00:23:29.418 --> 00:23:30.557
I'm so happy.

419
00:23:32.928 --> 00:23:34.027
I think they're all the same.

420
00:23:36.027 --> 00:23:37.227
I think so too.

421
00:23:37.628 --> 00:23:39.067
I don't think mine has any cheese inside.

422
00:23:40.838 --> 00:23:41.938
That's mine.

423
00:23:45.668 --> 00:23:47.237
- I don't have any cheese either. - Gosh, stop it.

424
00:23:47.237 --> 00:23:48.237
Aren't you going to eat?

425
00:23:50.747 --> 00:23:52.178
Why are you suddenly so caring?

426
00:23:52.448 --> 00:23:54.477
I wasn't caring. I just gave you what's yours.

427
00:23:54.747 --> 00:23:56.118
You really can't be nice, can you?

428
00:23:56.348 --> 00:23:58.348
Does it hurt to say, "Thank you"?

429
00:23:59.148 --> 00:24:03.327
- Thank you. - What a good boy.

430
00:24:04.287 --> 00:24:05.928
I really can't hate you.

431
00:24:13.598 --> 00:24:15.237
I have a favor to ask of you.

432
00:24:16.267 --> 00:24:19.368
I even bought snacks for everyone, so I'm hoping you won't refuse.

433
00:24:31.817 --> 00:24:33.158
You thought I was just going to leave, didn't you?

434
00:24:37.128 --> 00:24:38.128
Get in.

435
00:24:39.727 --> 00:24:41.158
Thank you, Mr. Park.

436
00:24:42.128 --> 00:24:44.267
You're good at drawing the line.

437
00:24:44.297 --> 00:24:45.967
You always call me Mr. Park.

438
00:24:46.368 --> 00:24:47.967
Then what else should I call you?

439
00:24:50.307 --> 00:24:51.307
Well, Jung Woo?

440
00:24:53.037 --> 00:24:54.237
Jung Woo?

441
00:24:57.577 --> 00:24:59.178
Don't do it. It makes me cringe.

442
00:25:01.577 --> 00:25:03.547
Come with me. I have something to show you.

443
00:25:05.188 --> 00:25:06.287
Why are you following me?

444
00:25:06.287 --> 00:25:08.088
I told you I'd bring it to you.

445
00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:11.027
(Rooibos, Fruit Blending)

446
00:25:11.257 --> 00:25:12.588
I don't want to wait.

447
00:25:12.588 --> 00:25:14.557
I'm mad at my life these days.

448
00:25:14.557 --> 00:25:16.227
You've been mad for a long time.

449
00:25:17.267 --> 00:25:20.067
You were mad when I came to Korea and met you for the first time.

450
00:25:22.797 --> 00:25:25.938
I never thought my life...

451
00:25:26.777 --> 00:25:29.178
would be this down in the dumps.

452
00:25:29.178 --> 00:25:31.378
If that's how you feel about your life,

453
00:25:31.378 --> 00:25:32.507
then it is in the ditch.

454
00:25:32.507 --> 00:25:33.618
Hey.

455
00:25:34.747 --> 00:25:36.817
All addictions are bad.

456
00:25:36.817 --> 00:25:39.487
Just because you like my special blend of tea,

457
00:25:39.487 --> 00:25:41.618
you shouldn't rely on it for sleep all the time.

458
00:25:42.158 --> 00:25:43.827
My life isn't that bad.

459
00:25:43.827 --> 00:25:45.027
I'm talented.

460
00:25:45.027 --> 00:25:47.227
I'll become the head writer before I turn 30.

461
00:25:47.398 --> 00:25:50.497
This blend is eight parts rooibos and two parts lemongrass.

462
00:25:50.497 --> 00:25:52.428
It'll relax you and you'll sleep like a baby.

463
00:25:52.428 --> 00:25:53.467
Okay.

464
00:25:54.797 --> 00:25:57.807
Why am I becoming so submissive to you?

465
00:25:57.938 --> 00:26:00.777
I can't understand. You're not even nice to me.

466
00:26:00.777 --> 00:26:03.648
What do you mean by that when I'm giving you my tea?

467
00:26:04.277 --> 00:26:05.448
You're right.

468
00:26:05.908 --> 00:26:08.477
But why do I feel like you're not being nice to me?

469
00:26:12.047 --> 00:26:13.257
I met Hyun Soo.

470
00:26:14.618 --> 00:26:16.928
So? Did you like it?

471
00:26:17.928 --> 00:26:19.997
Are you two not close anymore?

472
00:26:20.057 --> 00:26:22.527
You haven't really talked about her over the past few years.

473
00:26:23.868 --> 00:26:26.868
Hyun Soo and I no longer have a relationship where...

474
00:26:26.868 --> 00:26:28.698
being close or not matters.

475
00:26:29.638 --> 00:26:31.138
We're following the same path.

476
00:26:31.967 --> 00:26:35.408
You can't have a stronger bond than that.

477
00:26:44.148 --> 00:26:45.348
There's no path.

478
00:26:46.118 --> 00:26:48.057
I'm not here for a path.

479
00:26:49.057 --> 00:26:50.227
Hello.

480
00:26:51.257 --> 00:26:52.628
This one here is a fighter.

481
00:26:56.297 --> 00:26:58.098
What a beautiful flower.

482
00:26:58.227 --> 00:27:00.138
Right? It's pretty.

483
00:27:01.467 --> 00:27:03.208
It's been five years since I saw this flower.

484
00:27:04.307 --> 00:27:06.307
Every year around this time,

485
00:27:07.237 --> 00:27:09.537
it says hello and asks me, "Are you doing well..."

486
00:27:09.537 --> 00:27:10.908
"just like me?"

487
00:27:11.878 --> 00:27:13.118
And then this is what I say.

488
00:27:13.918 --> 00:27:14.948
"Yes."

489
00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:17.017
"I'm alive and well."

490
00:27:18.148 --> 00:27:20.188
It's not "I'm living my life well."

491
00:27:22.487 --> 00:27:23.688
It's "I'm alive."

492
00:27:26.928 --> 00:27:30.198
This is why you stayed bright after hitting rock bottom?

493
00:27:38.208 --> 00:27:39.608
I guess you must be scared.

494
00:27:47.618 --> 00:27:49.418
Aren't I pretty great?

495
00:27:53.717 --> 00:27:55.888
I stayed nice for five years...

496
00:27:55.888 --> 00:27:57.658
right in front of the woman I confessed my feelings to.

497
00:28:00.827 --> 00:28:01.997
Thank you.

498
00:28:02.358 --> 00:28:03.698
What are you thanking me for?

499
00:28:04.368 --> 00:28:05.527
For giving up on my feelings?

500
00:28:06.497 --> 00:28:08.237
If that's the case, it's too early to thank me.

501
00:28:09.908 --> 00:28:11.368
You were the first one to recognize my talent,

502
00:28:11.368 --> 00:28:12.838
and you trusted me all this time.

503
00:28:12.838 --> 00:28:15.507
You're drawing the line again, me as the CEO and you the writer.

504
00:28:16.547 --> 00:28:18.648
When are you going to stop drawing the line?

505
00:28:21.577 --> 00:28:23.133
It's because you're my woman,

506
00:28:23.158 --> 00:28:24.712
not because you're a writer.

507
00:28:26.557 --> 00:28:28.918
I don't like writers. Most of them are crazy.

508
00:28:29.557 --> 00:28:32.158
I'm crazy too. Didn't you know?

509
00:28:33.598 --> 00:28:34.598
No, I didn't know.

510
00:28:36.928 --> 00:28:38.297
Why are you so surprised?

511
00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:44.007
What did Joon Ha say?

512
00:28:44.608 --> 00:28:45.807
Tell me now.

513
00:28:46.777 --> 00:28:50.007
I want to know exactly what's going on and deal with it.

514
00:28:54.118 --> 00:28:55.577
They hired another writer.

515
00:29:02.517 --> 00:29:04.487
Stay lively like this flower.

516
00:29:07.757 --> 00:29:09.428
This is too difficult.

517
00:29:20.138 --> 00:29:23.277
(Episode 10 will be aired shortly.)
