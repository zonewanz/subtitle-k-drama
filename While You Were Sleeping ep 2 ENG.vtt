00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:08.687
(Kiyoung Hospital)

2
00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:10.986
A suspect interview?

3
00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:12.357
What is going on?

4
00:00:12.357 --> 00:00:15.256
You know, that lady who woke up after being in a coma for 10 months.

5
00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:17.256
I heard that a prosecutor will interview her here.

6
00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:18.256
In her ward?

7
00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:19.667
- It's Room 610. - Oh, they're here.

8
00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:21.397
That man must be the prosecutor.

9
00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:23.667
- Are you her guardian? - No.

10
00:00:36.147 --> 00:00:37.216
Ms. Nam,

11
00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:39.687
you know you're being investigated for violating...

12
00:00:39.687 --> 00:00:41.516
the Special Cases Concerning Traffic Accidents Act, right?

13
00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:43.556
You have the right to remain silent and refuse...

14
00:00:43.617 --> 00:00:46.487
to answer questions that may be used against you.

15
00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:50.096
Remaining silent will not be used against you.

16
00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:53.697
Because it's me,

17
00:00:54.697 --> 00:00:56.337
I can believe you.

18
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.806
You also have the right...

19
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.437
to consult an attorney and have an attorney present during questioning.

20
00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:10.176
Okay.

21
00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:14.587
February 14, 2016,

22
00:01:14.587 --> 00:01:17.217
on your way home in your mother's car,

23
00:01:17.357 --> 00:01:20.187
you hit Mr. Han Woo Tak at an intersection in Sanggu-dong...

24
00:01:20.257 --> 00:01:22.127
with the car and killed him. Correct?

25
00:01:23.757 --> 00:01:25.467
I didn't drive.

26
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.797
The man I was with, Lee Yoo Bum, drove the car.

27
00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:32.866
Right, that's what you said in the interview with the detective.

28
00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:36.576
Yes. He didn't believe me though.

29
00:01:42.377 --> 00:01:45.147
I interviewed Mr. Lee as well.

30
00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:48.016
What did he say?

31
00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:50.116
I asked him if he drove the car that day, and he said...

32
00:01:54.726 --> 00:01:56.127
That's what I regret the most.

33
00:01:56.857 --> 00:01:58.127
I should've driven that day.

34
00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:00.197
I tried to stop her.

35
00:02:00.297 --> 00:02:02.096
I told her she shouldn't drive as the roads were slippery,

36
00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:05.067
but she said she has to rush home because her mom wasn't picking up.

37
00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:07.206
I couldn't let her go alone.

38
00:02:07.636 --> 00:02:09.837
That's why I went with her. I was worried.

39
00:02:11.277 --> 00:02:13.607
That's a lie. He's lying.

40
00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:17.447
I know that he's the one... He's the one who drove that day.

41
00:02:19.846 --> 00:02:23.587
We analyzed the blood on the airbag from the driver's seat,

42
00:02:24.087 --> 00:02:26.426
and your DNA was found on it.

43
00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:28.386
That's impossible.

44
00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:30.397
Even the dashboard camera footage from the ambulance...

45
00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:32.866
shows that you were rescued from the driver's seat.

46
00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:35.697
Mr. Lee was rescued from the passenger seat.

47
00:02:35.897 --> 00:02:39.266
I swear. I did not drive.

48
00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:42.206
Then how will you explain your DNA and the dashboard camera footage?

49
00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:44.806
I'm sure someone tampered with the evidence.

50
00:02:51.317 --> 00:02:53.987
Hong Joo, Hong Joo, Hong Joo!

51
00:02:58.527 --> 00:03:00.527
I lost my consciousness as soon as the accident happened.

52
00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:03.596
Somebody must've moved me to the driver's seat.

53
00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:07.067
He must've wiped his blood off the airbag and left mine on it,

54
00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:09.397
then sat on the passenger seat.

55
00:03:20.547 --> 00:03:22.947
By "somebody", are you referring to...

56
00:03:22.947 --> 00:03:24.147
It must've been Yoo Bum.

57
00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:27.717
I bet he dumped everything on me so that he can get out of it.

58
00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:29.487
You think he framed you.

59
00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:32.857
That's a speculation.

60
00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:37.697
We trust evidence more than mere speculations.

61
00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:41.467
Unfortunately, none of the evidence supports your claim.

62
00:03:45.937 --> 00:03:47.406
Then what should I do?

63
00:03:49.136 --> 00:03:50.937
There's nothing I can do to prove my innocence.

64
00:03:54.346 --> 00:03:56.947
All the evidence points to you.

65
00:03:57.377 --> 00:03:59.147
Admitting it will be the best for your sake...

66
00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:03.016
because it can be recognized as a mitigating sentencing factor.

67
00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:07.286
Even though I didn't cause the accident?

68
00:04:08.627 --> 00:04:10.556
The victim's family is demanding punishment for you.

69
00:04:11.357 --> 00:04:12.897
Continuing to deny it...

70
00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:15.366
might act as an aggravating factor that increases your sentence.

71
00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:38.187
(Lee Yoo Bum)

72
00:04:57.676 --> 00:04:59.976
If something happens to you because of me,

73
00:05:00.206 --> 00:05:02.246
I won't be able to go on with my life.

74
00:05:03.777 --> 00:05:05.886
You're the only one I have in this whole world,

75
00:05:06.447 --> 00:05:08.687
so don't leave me.

76
00:05:09.757 --> 00:05:10.917
Okay?

77
00:05:32.976 --> 00:05:35.516
Ms. Nam. What on earth are you doing now?

78
00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:37.917
Don't come near me!

79
00:05:40.246 --> 00:05:42.556
- I'll jump if you come any closer. - Just come down first.

80
00:05:43.116 --> 00:05:44.556
We can take time and talk about everything.

81
00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:46.386
What is that going to change?

82
00:05:46.987 --> 00:05:48.326
I already told you everything.

83
00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:50.726
It was Valentine's Day, and it snowed!

84
00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:54.297
That's why Yoo Bum drove instead of me,

85
00:05:54.366 --> 00:05:55.897
and someone died.

86
00:05:57.366 --> 00:06:00.406
Then he made it look like I was the driver!

87
00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:05.076
No one believes me no matter how hard I try to explain.

88
00:06:05.777 --> 00:06:07.076
What's the point?

89
00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:11.277
I'll believe you.

90
00:06:19.056 --> 00:06:20.226
I'll believe what you say,

91
00:06:21.456 --> 00:06:22.456
so please here.

92
00:06:32.737 --> 00:06:34.136
If this was a dream,

93
00:06:35.837 --> 00:06:37.437
I'd be so happy.

94
00:06:41.507 --> 00:06:43.217
If this was your dream...

95
00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.286
Thank you...

96
00:06:51.616 --> 00:06:53.087
for saying that you'll believe me.

97
00:06:54.987 --> 00:06:56.127
Ms. Nam.

98
00:06:58.156 --> 00:06:59.226
- Gosh! - No!

99
00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:19.016
No!

100
00:07:31.096 --> 00:07:32.366
Oh, my gosh.

101
00:07:32.897 --> 00:07:34.397
How can a dream...

102
00:07:35.397 --> 00:07:36.536
feel so real?

103
00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:42.507
(February 14, 2016)

104
00:07:48.107 --> 00:07:49.377
My gosh.

105
00:07:51.886 --> 00:07:52.886
You're up?

106
00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:54.917
Gosh, you totally scared me.

107
00:07:55.286 --> 00:07:56.516
Why are you up so early?

108
00:07:56.656 --> 00:07:58.286
I had a weird dream.

109
00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:00.987
It creeped me out, and it felt so real.

110
00:08:01.087 --> 00:08:02.357
What was it about?

111
00:08:05.197 --> 00:08:08.027
I saw the girl who lives across the street.

112
00:08:08.996 --> 00:08:11.667
I knew something was going to happen the moment you called her rude.

113
00:08:11.766 --> 00:08:13.766
That's how typical romantic comedies begin.

114
00:08:14.007 --> 00:08:16.507
And she even showed up in your dream.

115
00:08:17.306 --> 00:08:19.647
I like where this is going. What was the genre?

116
00:08:19.746 --> 00:08:21.746
Romantic comedy? Passionate melodrama?

117
00:08:21.746 --> 00:08:23.277
Or was it X-rated?

118
00:08:26.487 --> 00:08:28.516
That girl died in my dream.

119
00:08:30.056 --> 00:08:31.056
What?

120
00:08:34.286 --> 00:08:35.357
No!

121
00:08:38.426 --> 00:08:40.766
What? Then it's a thriller.

122
00:08:41.266 --> 00:08:43.766
That's right. A thriller that feels so real.

123
00:08:45.337 --> 00:08:46.906
Real, my foot.

124
00:08:47.737 --> 00:08:49.277
You said that woman died in the dream too.

125
00:08:49.437 --> 00:08:50.636
Look, she's totally fine.

126
00:08:51.107 --> 00:08:52.147
I'm relieved.

127
00:08:52.147 --> 00:08:54.576
And why did Yoo Bum show up in your dream? That's so random.

128
00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:56.116
I ran into him a little while ago.

129
00:08:56.147 --> 00:08:57.947
You let him walk away? You should've punched him.

130
00:08:57.947 --> 00:09:00.886
I just said hi with a big smile on my face like a total idiot.

131
00:09:00.886 --> 00:09:02.456
If I were you, I would've cussed him...

132
00:09:02.456 --> 00:09:04.087
and spat on his face like this.

133
00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:13.326
By the way, was that girl seeing Yoo Bum in the dream?

134
00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:16.437
They were meeting on Valentine's Day, so I guess so.

135
00:09:16.437 --> 00:09:17.567
It's just a nightmare.

136
00:09:17.866 --> 00:09:20.136
Two people you hate the most showed up in your dream.

137
00:09:20.136 --> 00:09:21.766
You basically wrote a bad soap opera.

138
00:09:22.176 --> 00:09:23.277
What's the date today?

139
00:09:23.277 --> 00:09:24.306
February 14.

140
00:09:25.476 --> 00:09:28.176
It's Valentine's Day, and you're supposed to pick up your new car.

141
00:09:28.176 --> 00:09:29.917
All couples will be lovey-dovey,

142
00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:32.917
and you'll test-drive your new car looking all pathetic.

143
00:09:34.016 --> 00:09:36.116
- Do you have any plans? - I do.

144
00:09:38.527 --> 00:09:40.726
Cancel them. You better not be late.

145
00:09:42.726 --> 00:09:43.826
Gosh, seriously!

146
00:10:11.286 --> 00:10:12.426
What do you want?

147
00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:14.757
Why are you sitting here out of all the seats?

148
00:10:17.197 --> 00:10:18.726
I want to ask you something.

149
00:10:19.096 --> 00:10:20.096
Me?

150
00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:22.397
Do you know a guy named Lee Yoo Bum?

151
00:10:24.337 --> 00:10:26.036
How did you know...

152
00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:29.837
You've been stalking me, haven't you?

153
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:32.507
You gathered intel on me to make a move on me, right?

154
00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:34.806
Well, you know Lee Yoo Bum?

155
00:10:35.746 --> 00:10:37.377
- Taxi! - Wait.

156
00:10:37.377 --> 00:10:38.717
You're meeting him later today, right?

157
00:10:38.987 --> 00:10:41.886
You better not do this. I'll scream if you keep this up.

158
00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:45.826
I know that I must sound totally crazy right now,

159
00:10:45.826 --> 00:10:47.226
but please just hear me out.

160
00:10:47.456 --> 00:10:49.926
Don't meet him today, and do not drive because it'll snow.

161
00:10:49.926 --> 00:10:51.797
Don't even go near cars, okay?

162
00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:56.937
Hey, did you hear what I just said?

163
00:11:07.706 --> 00:11:08.817
Are you all right?

164
00:11:09.147 --> 00:11:11.076
He must be a stalker.

165
00:11:11.076 --> 00:11:14.047
Why does he care whether I drive or not? It's none of his business.

166
00:11:15.357 --> 00:11:18.956
Why do you care? It's none of your business.

167
00:11:21.226 --> 00:11:24.156
Sir, do you know if it's supposed to snow today?

168
00:11:24.257 --> 00:11:26.766
No, it's supposed to be sunny all day.

169
00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:43.947
Thank you.

170
00:11:44.147 --> 00:11:45.447
Bye.

171
00:11:57.226 --> 00:11:59.366
Hey, do you know what time it is right now?

172
00:12:01.426 --> 00:12:03.036
- Yoo Bum. - What's up?

173
00:12:03.036 --> 00:12:04.237
Do you have a date?

174
00:12:05.136 --> 00:12:07.036
My gosh, did you get a new car?

175
00:12:08.337 --> 00:12:09.777
What brings you here?

176
00:12:09.906 --> 00:12:11.377
I have a date.

177
00:12:12.976 --> 00:12:14.047
Ms. Nam Hong Joo?

178
00:12:14.107 --> 00:12:15.246
Yoo Bum!

179
00:12:19.647 --> 00:12:21.687
Yoo Bum, you said you'd treat me to sushi.

180
00:12:21.786 --> 00:12:22.786
Let's go now.

181
00:12:22.786 --> 00:12:25.456
Hey, today won't work. We already have other plans.

182
00:12:27.656 --> 00:12:29.726
I have no plans, so treat me today, okay?

183
00:12:30.056 --> 00:12:32.467
Hey, what's with you? Today is Valentine's Day.

184
00:12:32.467 --> 00:12:33.496
That's why...

185
00:12:37.496 --> 00:12:39.806
I'm craving sushi so much right now,

186
00:12:39.806 --> 00:12:42.036
but eating sushi alone on Valentine's Day will look weird.

187
00:12:42.036 --> 00:12:45.476
Two guys eating sushi together on Valentine's Day will look weirder.

188
00:12:45.647 --> 00:12:46.746
What are you doing out here?

189
00:12:47.047 --> 00:12:48.047
Hey, you.

190
00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:54.817
I told you to just go straight home today.

191
00:12:56.016 --> 00:12:58.726
Why do I have to do that? Tell me why.

192
00:13:00.987 --> 00:13:02.556
- It's... - Hang on a second.

193
00:13:03.627 --> 00:13:05.926
Am I the only one who has no idea what's going on right now?

194
00:13:10.996 --> 00:13:12.136
Let's go, Hong Joo.

195
00:13:13.266 --> 00:13:16.107
Hey, you and I will have to talk about this another day.

196
00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:17.976
Let's go.

197
00:13:25.987 --> 00:13:27.147
Sorry. I'm late, right?

198
00:13:28.386 --> 00:13:30.917
Oh, my. This car is a beauty.

199
00:13:31.687 --> 00:13:34.257
Gosh, what is all this? Did you get all the options?

200
00:13:34.286 --> 00:13:35.456
My, look at this.

201
00:13:37.527 --> 00:13:40.996
My friend is having a piano recital today. Do you want to go?

202
00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:44.697
All right, I'll go.

203
00:13:44.797 --> 00:13:46.237
I should mind my own business. Let's go.

204
00:13:54.547 --> 00:13:56.817
What? It's not supposed to snow today.

205
00:14:03.516 --> 00:14:04.817
I already told you everything.

206
00:14:05.326 --> 00:14:07.527
It was Valentine's Day, and it snowed!

207
00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:15.136
Hey, I know that this will sound crazy,

208
00:14:15.766 --> 00:14:17.467
but I think things are happening exactly like my dream.

209
00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:19.136
The nightmare you had this morning?

210
00:14:20.107 --> 00:14:21.706
- Yes. - Jae Chan,

211
00:14:21.737 --> 00:14:24.136
that's crazy talk. Cut the nonsense, and let's go.

212
00:14:26.547 --> 00:14:28.576
I need to check one more thing. Just one more thing.

213
00:14:30.217 --> 00:14:31.917
Gosh, it'll start soon.

214
00:14:44.826 --> 00:14:46.326
I forgot to lock the door.

215
00:14:46.697 --> 00:14:49.496
I didn't lock the door. I should rush back home.

216
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.752
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E02 While You Were Sleeping "The Accident"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

217
00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:19.726
It was true.

218
00:15:20.866 --> 00:15:22.866
Yoo Bum really drove the car.

219
00:15:28.806 --> 00:15:29.806
Yoo Bum!

220
00:15:30.237 --> 00:15:31.337
Ms. Nam!

221
00:15:32.607 --> 00:15:33.746
Stop!

222
00:15:37.346 --> 00:15:38.647
Jae Chan, what's going on?

223
00:15:39.217 --> 00:15:40.947
Hey, call the police right now.

224
00:15:41.016 --> 00:15:43.317
Tell them to stop the car with the plate number ending in 4773.

225
00:15:44.556 --> 00:15:46.886
Have you lost your mind? Call the police and say what?

226
00:15:46.886 --> 00:15:49.926
"According to my brother's dream, there will be an accident soon"?

227
00:15:50.297 --> 00:15:51.627
This is crazy.

228
00:15:51.797 --> 00:15:53.397
You're acting so weird.

229
00:15:53.467 --> 00:15:55.096
Why do you care so much about that girl?

230
00:15:55.096 --> 00:15:56.636
It's not that I care about her. I just...

231
00:15:59.937 --> 00:16:01.706
I just don't want her to end up like me.

232
00:16:02.536 --> 00:16:04.676
What if she lets him dump everything on her like an idiot?

233
00:16:05.306 --> 00:16:08.007
Meeting Yoo Bum again must've really stressed you out.

234
00:16:08.147 --> 00:16:09.846
That's probably why you had that nightmare.

235
00:16:13.116 --> 00:16:14.386
Come on.

236
00:16:15.717 --> 00:16:16.917
Let's go.

237
00:16:20.487 --> 00:16:22.496
Yes, I really should mind my own business.

238
00:16:22.996 --> 00:16:25.127
If I go any further, I'll look like a total lunatic.

239
00:16:37.636 --> 00:16:39.176
Gosh, seriously.

240
00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:42.647
Jae Chan, wait up. Jae Chan, stop!

241
00:16:45.116 --> 00:16:46.846
How can you just take off like that?

242
00:17:02.136 --> 00:17:04.467
An accident? What are you talking about?

243
00:17:04.797 --> 00:17:07.136
Well, I'm not talking about right now.

244
00:17:07.536 --> 00:17:09.437
Something like that might happen in the future.

245
00:17:12.107 --> 00:17:13.976
I'll be okay even if that happens,

246
00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:16.246
so keep my mom safe for me.

247
00:17:16.877 --> 00:17:17.917
Okay.

248
00:17:18.016 --> 00:17:20.717
No matter what happens, I'll be sure...

249
00:17:20.817 --> 00:17:22.817
to keep you and your mom safe. Are we good now?

250
00:17:27.556 --> 00:17:30.027
By the way, what happened between you and Jae Chan?

251
00:17:31.096 --> 00:17:32.627
It looked like he was...

252
00:18:27.886 --> 00:18:29.087
Are you okay?

253
00:19:20.266 --> 00:19:21.366
Did you get hurt?

254
00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:26.906
Are you all right?

255
00:19:28.076 --> 00:19:29.076
Yes.

256
00:19:33.286 --> 00:19:34.286
Jae Chan.

257
00:19:35.047 --> 00:19:36.217
Did you just hit this car?

258
00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:39.687
Yes, I guess my car slipped because of the snow.

259
00:19:40.527 --> 00:19:41.726
This...

260
00:19:42.527 --> 00:19:43.926
was intentional, wasn't it?

261
00:19:44.027 --> 00:19:45.926
No, I told you that my car slipped in the snow.

262
00:19:45.926 --> 00:19:47.596
- I'm sorry. - Hey.

263
00:19:48.837 --> 00:19:49.897
Hey!

264
00:19:51.536 --> 00:19:52.967
Do you think I'm blind or what?

265
00:19:53.107 --> 00:19:54.766
You followed us and crashed the car.

266
00:19:54.766 --> 00:19:56.806
It was obviously intentional.

267
00:19:56.976 --> 00:19:59.746
How dare you lie to my face?

268
00:20:00.676 --> 00:20:02.917
- That's not what happened. - Then what just happened?

269
00:20:03.016 --> 00:20:04.976
Hey, answer me!

270
00:20:05.417 --> 00:20:06.687
Do you need money?

271
00:20:06.687 --> 00:20:08.317
Is this a car accident scam or what?

272
00:20:10.857 --> 00:20:13.027
Hadn't I done what I did, you would've killed a person.

273
00:20:13.187 --> 00:20:14.826
You've totally lost your mind.

274
00:20:15.697 --> 00:20:17.127
You've gone crazy.

275
00:20:19.826 --> 00:20:22.397
Are you doing this because of that motorcycle accident?

276
00:20:25.837 --> 00:20:28.237
What should we do, Jae Chan? I think the police are coming.

277
00:20:31.706 --> 00:20:32.976
Darn it, this is crazy.

278
00:20:34.076 --> 00:20:36.047
Dad will find out I bought that motorcycle.

279
00:20:47.456 --> 00:20:49.357
You should beg the police when they get here.

280
00:20:49.527 --> 00:20:51.866
Tell them that you're sorry and that you'll pay for the damages.

281
00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:53.226
What are you talking about?

282
00:20:53.596 --> 00:20:55.496
You drove it. Why should I pay for the damages?

283
00:20:56.366 --> 00:20:58.706
Tell them that you drove it. That will look more natural.

284
00:20:58.706 --> 00:21:00.136
Are you saying you'll lie to them?

285
00:21:00.906 --> 00:21:02.377
No, Jae Chan.

286
00:21:02.806 --> 00:21:04.976
I'm saying I'll tell them what makes more sense.

287
00:21:05.076 --> 00:21:06.507
Let's be honest.

288
00:21:09.076 --> 00:21:10.746
It makes more sense that you did it.

289
00:21:14.087 --> 00:21:16.817
It doesn't make any sense! This is your fault.

290
00:21:16.987 --> 00:21:19.656
I'll tell the police the truth when they get here.

291
00:21:21.826 --> 00:21:22.857
Really?

292
00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:30.837
("Criminal Law: Practice Questions")

293
00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:37.337
I'll tell them that it was your doing.

294
00:21:38.036 --> 00:21:40.576
- Yoo Bum! - There are no witnesses,

295
00:21:42.516 --> 00:21:44.147
and you and I are the only ones here.

296
00:21:51.087 --> 00:21:52.127
I'm curious.

297
00:21:53.286 --> 00:21:54.556
Whom do you think the police...

298
00:21:56.127 --> 00:21:57.397
will believe?

299
00:22:06.406 --> 00:22:08.167
I almost killed someone?

300
00:22:09.007 --> 00:22:11.076
Stop spewing such nonsense, okay?

301
00:22:11.076 --> 00:22:14.047
Jae Chan, you've totally lost your mind. Are you aware of that?

302
00:22:15.447 --> 00:22:17.717
No, I'm totally sane.

303
00:22:18.516 --> 00:22:21.547
You would've killed that man had I not stopped the car.

304
00:22:21.786 --> 00:22:23.987
Also, you would've tampered with evidence...

305
00:22:23.987 --> 00:22:25.956
to frame her for driving the car.

306
00:22:25.956 --> 00:22:27.857
Enough, you crazy jerk!

307
00:22:27.857 --> 00:22:30.697
She would've ended up with a criminal record for killing someone,

308
00:22:31.357 --> 00:22:33.496
and the shock would've killed her mom too.

309
00:22:34.496 --> 00:22:35.697
And that woman...

310
00:22:36.136 --> 00:22:38.837
would've taken her own life like an idiot from feeling victimized.

311
00:22:39.007 --> 00:22:40.136
You...

312
00:22:42.176 --> 00:22:44.337
are more than capable of doing that.

313
00:22:47.976 --> 00:22:49.417
You haven't changed one bit.

314
00:22:49.917 --> 00:22:52.587
You still blame others for everything and give lame excuses.

315
00:22:54.187 --> 00:22:56.187
The truth is, you almost killed us.

316
00:22:58.527 --> 00:22:59.527
No.

317
00:23:00.926 --> 00:23:02.397
I did it to save lives.

318
00:23:16.437 --> 00:23:18.136
Who on earth would believe that?

319
00:23:20.906 --> 00:23:21.917
Hong Joo.

320
00:23:23.277 --> 00:23:24.976
Do you believe what this lunatic is saying?

321
00:23:40.297 --> 00:23:41.326
Right.

322
00:23:42.136 --> 00:23:43.536
Who'd believe me...

323
00:23:44.697 --> 00:23:46.667
if I say that I saw you in my dream...

324
00:23:49.976 --> 00:23:52.147
and that I came here to change what I saw in my dream...

325
00:23:54.746 --> 00:23:56.676
because you looked so sad in it.

326
00:23:59.047 --> 00:24:00.647
No one will believe...

327
00:24:01.587 --> 00:24:02.917
that I changed your future.

328
00:25:16.297 --> 00:25:17.297
I...

329
00:25:17.956 --> 00:25:19.226
believe in you.

330
00:25:21.996 --> 00:25:23.067
Because it's me,

331
00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:26.406
I can believe you.

332
00:25:35.147 --> 00:25:36.476
Thank you.
