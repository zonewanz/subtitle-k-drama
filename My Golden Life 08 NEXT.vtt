(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:11.034
I've had enough of this. You're just going too far.

4
00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:13.165
I knew you'd be like that though.

5
00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.165
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:16.534
What was your name? Seo Ji An?

7
00:00:17.404 --> 00:00:20.305
Get out of our house now.

8
00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:24.345
- What? - Get out of this house!

9
00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:27.944
How much do you want before you leave?

10
00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.884
How much did you expect before you came here?

11
00:00:30.544 --> 00:00:33.315
What... What are you talking about?

12
00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:36.325
You're here for money. I'll pay you that money.

13
00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:43.365
How much will you pay me?

14
00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:44.794
What?

15
00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:46.865
You should've done this earlier.

16
00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:48.135
This is who you really are.

17
00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:50.304
Why act like my brother and make me uncomfortable?

18
00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:53.675
Never mind. It must've been fun to fool me.

19
00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:54.874
Fool you?

20
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:57.815
Is that how you describe...

21
00:00:58.145 --> 00:00:59.675
my concerns and efforts for you?

22
00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:01.245
I never asked for any of that,

23
00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:04.084
and I said you shouldn't make unnecessary efforts.

24
00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.354
You're just incorrigible.

25
00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:07.584
Who do you think you are...

26
00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:10.824
- to say that to me? - The way you address me!

27
00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:14.295
That proves how terrible a person you are.

28
00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.694
Do I have to call you brother...

29
00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:18.065
when I can't see you as a brother?.

30
00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:20.565
You used to be the person I hated the most.

31
00:01:20.565 --> 00:01:21.964
What about Mother and Father?

32
00:01:23.164 --> 00:01:24.304
Did you not address them as Mother and Father...

33
00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:25.505
because you deny them?

34
00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:29.944
The person you hated the most is now your brother.

35
00:01:30.774 --> 00:01:32.545
And you decided to join this family...

36
00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:34.084
when you're not even ready to call them your parents.

37
00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:37.045
- About our parents... - You think I blame you...

38
00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:38.515
for joining our family because of money?

39
00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:40.155
Not at all.

40
00:01:40.384 --> 00:01:42.884
I'm not blaming you for that. That's normal.

41
00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:45.724
But why act like a beggar when you want money?

42
00:01:45.724 --> 00:01:47.365
Why would you want it for free?

43
00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:48.694
When did I ask for anything...

44
00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:49.964
at no cost?

45
00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:52.265
I never asked for anything.

46
00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:54.434
Only beggars ask for free stuff.

47
00:01:54.434 --> 00:01:56.604
Do you want it for free or what?

48
00:01:56.964 --> 00:01:59.175
How dare you lie to Mr. Myung...

49
00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:00.235
and make him lie too?

50
00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:02.545
You should've given up when Mother caught you.

51
00:02:02.744 --> 00:02:03.944
How dare you keep lying to her?

52
00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:06.115
Also, how dare you go in and out of the outhouse...

53
00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:08.244
for your hidden things at this hour of the night?

54
00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:13.314
And the 20,000 dollars...

55
00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:16.784
Don't...

56
00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:19.594
worry about our parents. They're my parents too.

57
00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:22.665
I only spent one night here.

58
00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:24.464
I'll handle it myself.

59
00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:26.395
Also, I don't think...

60
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:30.064
all siblings must be friendly with each other.

61
00:02:30.334 --> 00:02:31.934
Parents and siblings aren't the same.

62
00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:35.304
I learned lying is bad while growing up.

63
00:02:35.344 --> 00:02:37.645
It was a lie Mr. Myung wouldn't suffer from.

64
00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:41.084
And I lied because I had my own reasons.

65
00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:43.015
I'll be more careful from now on.

66
00:02:44.654 --> 00:02:46.415
But you can't kick me out just like that.

67
00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:48.024
You're not my parents.

68
00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:51.355
- That's just too much. - You sure are something.

69
00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:54.425
You have a knack for testing my patience.

70
00:02:54.665 --> 00:02:55.865
And this isn't your first time.

71
00:02:57.225 --> 00:02:58.934
You don't want to address me as your brother?

72
00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:00.295
Then get out.

73
00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:03.265
You gave away my gift like it's nothing?

74
00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:05.205
Get out of this house instead of patronizing us.

75
00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:06.475
I wasn't patronizing you.

76
00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:08.874
Looking down on me means you're looking down on us.

77
00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:10.645
I told you.

78
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.615
We have our own set of rules here.

79
00:03:13.314 --> 00:03:14.985
Do you want to be treated like my brother that much?

80
00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:17.145
No way. From someone like you?

81
00:03:18.214 --> 00:03:21.325
When you bought those gifts for your old family,

82
00:03:21.624 --> 00:03:23.825
did you buy a single gift for our family?

83
00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:26.455
You didn't even think about us, did you?

84
00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:30.195
You got money from Mom.

85
00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:33.765
And you didn't buy a gift for Mom, Dad, or Seo Hyun.

86
00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:38.105
You might not remember or love us.

87
00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:40.135
Well, it's the same with me.

88
00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:41.705
But...

89
00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:44.615
my parents are a different story.

90
00:03:46.015 --> 00:03:47.344
No matter who you are,

91
00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:50.045
to them, you are their daughter.

92
00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:53.515
They were happy and excited to have you back.

93
00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:56.925
So...

94
00:03:57.554 --> 00:03:59.195
don't live in this house...

95
00:04:00.195 --> 00:04:02.494
if you will keep lying to Mom...

96
00:04:02.564 --> 00:04:04.534
and care only to give your old family...

97
00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:07.635
the presents they turned down.

98
00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:14.844
You hated me the most until a few days ago?

99
00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:18.374
So did I. I felt the same.

100
00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:20.744
Fine.

101
00:04:21.285 --> 00:04:22.715
Do as you please.

102
00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:27.215
But unless you follow the rules of our family,

103
00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:29.884
I won't let you slide.

104
00:04:49.908 --> 00:04:54.908
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

105
00:05:22.975 --> 00:05:24.845
To them, you are their daughter.

106
00:05:25.374 --> 00:05:27.514
They were happy and excited to have you back.

107
00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:42.124
Why does she have to be my sister?

108
00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:56.304
Who is it?

109
00:05:56.475 --> 00:05:58.215
Ms. No wants you to come down.

110
00:05:58.675 --> 00:05:59.715
Okay.

111
00:06:07.184 --> 00:06:09.824
- Did you call for me... - Take a seat.

112
00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:17.764
This is your schedule. Take a look.

113
00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:20.194
My... My schedule?

114
00:06:20.634 --> 00:06:22.934
(Weekly Lessons Schedule)

115
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.905
You were supposed to start next week.

116
00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:27.675
But things at work have gotten busy.

117
00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:29.905
Go to the gym this morning,

118
00:06:29.905 --> 00:06:31.514
and start from training your body.

119
00:06:31.944 --> 00:06:34.585
After gym, Ms. Yang will be here at 2pm.

120
00:06:34.684 --> 00:06:36.585
At 2pm?

121
00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:40.014
I'm supposed to have lunch with a friend today.

122
00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:41.425
A friend?

123
00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:44.025
Yes, it was promised beforehand.

124
00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:45.624
Is that so?

125
00:06:46.324 --> 00:06:49.295
Then have lunch with your friend,

126
00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:50.494
and come back home by 3pm.

127
00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:52.095
I'll postpone the lesson for an hour.

128
00:06:52.564 --> 00:06:54.264
Okay.

129
00:06:54.934 --> 00:06:56.804
Do you have any other plans?

130
00:06:57.235 --> 00:06:58.304
No.

131
00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:02.345
I'd like you not to make plans for the time being.

132
00:07:03.074 --> 00:07:04.744
You lost 25 years with us.

133
00:07:05.244 --> 00:07:07.275
Don't you want to get them back quickly?

134
00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:09.684
Yes, I understand.

135
00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:18.855
It's bread. This is surprising.

136
00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:20.795
Today, let's have this together.

137
00:07:21.064 --> 00:07:22.595
I'm going to have a cup of milk and head out.

138
00:07:24.095 --> 00:07:25.194
Take a seat.

139
00:07:26.035 --> 00:07:27.865
You need to taste this.

140
00:07:29.064 --> 00:07:30.975
This bread is very delicious.

141
00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:32.835
How delicious could a bread get?

142
00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:39.014
- It's good. - Isn't it?

143
00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:41.814
I'm thinking of selling this at the cafe.

144
00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:45.155
Customers ask for bread or sandwiches time to time.

145
00:07:46.684 --> 00:07:47.855
Okay. You should do that.

146
00:07:47.855 --> 00:07:49.485
Hey.

147
00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:51.425
Where are you going? Why rush so early?

148
00:07:52.194 --> 00:07:53.795
I have plans. I'll catch you later.

149
00:07:58.994 --> 00:08:01.535
Isn't this your first time making a suggestion?

150
00:08:05.934 --> 00:08:07.004
I'll call you.

151
00:08:20.314 --> 00:08:22.355
I'm sorry that this place is too shabby.

152
00:08:22.684 --> 00:08:24.394
Once your identity is made aware,

153
00:08:24.394 --> 00:08:26.954
you'll be going to a gym in a hotel.

154
00:08:27.295 --> 00:08:29.824
Until then, please utilize this establishment.

155
00:08:30.194 --> 00:08:33.264
Well, this gym is good enough for me.

156
00:08:34.205 --> 00:08:37.374
Thank you for coming back.

157
00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:39.274
Oh, okay.

158
00:08:39.705 --> 00:08:42.144
Thank you for welcoming me.

159
00:08:46.874 --> 00:08:51.985
47, 48, 49, 50.

160
00:08:52.884 --> 00:08:54.024
Open your eyes.

161
00:08:57.924 --> 00:09:00.794
Your pelvis is rotated to the right.

162
00:09:01.024 --> 00:09:03.124
And you are leaning forward with your weight.

163
00:09:03.965 --> 00:09:05.134
You're right.

164
00:09:05.335 --> 00:09:08.835
Since your body fat and muscles are below average,

165
00:09:08.835 --> 00:09:11.374
we'll begin with stretching.

166
00:09:11.374 --> 00:09:12.374
Okay.

167
00:09:12.374 --> 00:09:14.345
I'll head back now.

168
00:09:14.644 --> 00:09:17.004
You must come home by 2:30pm.

169
00:09:17.004 --> 00:09:18.744
Don't forget your makeup.

170
00:09:18.845 --> 00:09:21.085
Yes, I'll have lunch with my friend...

171
00:09:21.085 --> 00:09:23.044
and return home in time.

172
00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:44.634
Please put it here.

173
00:09:45.975 --> 00:09:48.605
I'll place another order for next month.

174
00:09:48.605 --> 00:09:49.744
Okay. Take care.

175
00:09:49.744 --> 00:09:51.575
Okay. Thank you.

176
00:09:56.284 --> 00:09:58.284
Mr. Kang, what is that?

177
00:09:58.284 --> 00:10:00.115
This is none of your business.

178
00:10:00.254 --> 00:10:02.185
Isn't that the secret ingredient...

179
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.384
that goes in the water for batter?

180
00:10:08.264 --> 00:10:10.565
So this was it.

181
00:10:11.894 --> 00:10:14.365
Wait, these aren't grains.

182
00:10:18.205 --> 00:10:20.605
- Hey! What are you doing? - Well, I...

183
00:10:21.975 --> 00:10:23.345
I'm sorry. Are you...

184
00:10:24.345 --> 00:10:25.445
Mr. Kang.

185
00:10:27.985 --> 00:10:30.485
You little rascal.

186
00:10:31.055 --> 00:10:32.455
I'm going to fire you.

187
00:10:32.955 --> 00:10:34.254
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:37.055
- I won't smell it again. - Goodness.

189
00:10:48.904 --> 00:10:50.365
Oh, my. The cafe owner.

190
00:10:53.374 --> 00:10:54.605
Are you sure?

191
00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:57.715
Yes, I'm thinking of selling it at the cafe.

192
00:10:58.715 --> 00:11:00.445
Why don't you take a look at our baked goods then?

193
00:11:04.585 --> 00:11:07.014
You have a variety of baked goods here.

194
00:11:08.555 --> 00:11:09.685
But...

195
00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.654
I take it that your boss isn't here?

196
00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:15.494
No, he must've gone to the storage room...

197
00:11:15.494 --> 00:11:17.565
to put away the ingredients.

198
00:11:18.764 --> 00:11:21.404
When you see my boss,

199
00:11:21.404 --> 00:11:23.465
you don't have to mention the delivery.

200
00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:24.904
When you place an order to me,

201
00:11:24.904 --> 00:11:26.735
I can deliver them to you.

202
00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:29.305
Can you do that?

203
00:11:29.644 --> 00:11:32.215
If you can, it'd be great.

204
00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.555
Hyuk, where do you want to meet?

205
00:11:43.284 --> 00:11:44.394
In front of my house?

206
00:11:44.394 --> 00:11:45.595
You wanted to meet at noon.

207
00:11:45.994 --> 00:11:47.664
Weren't you heading out from your house?

208
00:11:47.664 --> 00:11:49.494
You didn't have to come all the way to my house.

209
00:11:49.494 --> 00:11:51.264
We can meet at a cafe in the neighborhood.

210
00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.134
It's nothing. Just come out already.

211
00:11:53.134 --> 00:11:55.134
I'm at the alley in front of your house.

212
00:11:55.134 --> 00:11:56.735
You're at the alley in front of my house?

213
00:12:14.884 --> 00:12:16.884
This is my sister's phone.

214
00:12:16.884 --> 00:12:18.424
I see.

215
00:12:29.065 --> 00:12:30.565
What's taking her so long?

216
00:12:30.735 --> 00:12:32.034
Hyuk!

217
00:12:35.404 --> 00:12:36.744
Why is she coming from that way?

218
00:12:41.215 --> 00:12:42.514
What's with you?

219
00:12:42.514 --> 00:12:44.585
Why are you waiting in front of my place?

220
00:12:44.585 --> 00:12:46.315
Why did you come from that way?

221
00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:49.384
Where were you? And what are you wearing?

222
00:12:53.154 --> 00:12:54.494
I knew it.

223
00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:57.164
You knew what? What do you mean?

224
00:13:03.034 --> 00:13:04.205
This is 20,000 dollars.

225
00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:06.575
Pay that person back right away with this,

226
00:13:06.735 --> 00:13:08.345
and come work for me to pay me back monthly.

227
00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:09.874
There will be no interest.

228
00:13:11.044 --> 00:13:12.975
Hey, why are you being like this?

229
00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:15.815
Look who's talking. Have you lost your mind?

230
00:13:18.254 --> 00:13:20.014
What kind of mess have you gotten yourself in?

231
00:13:20.514 --> 00:13:22.585
- What do you mean? - You borrowed money?

232
00:13:22.884 --> 00:13:25.624
No one would just lend you 20,000 dollars.

233
00:13:25.754 --> 00:13:26.955
You got it back?

234
00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:29.624
No one would return that money under no condition.

235
00:13:29.624 --> 00:13:30.935
Don't even try to make excuses.

236
00:13:31.365 --> 00:13:33.595
I started working before college to make money...

237
00:13:33.595 --> 00:13:35.664
for my tuition fees, and I even have my business.

238
00:13:35.705 --> 00:13:37.374
I've seen and been through enough to know.

239
00:13:38.835 --> 00:13:40.975
I can't watch you ruin your life like this,

240
00:13:42.174 --> 00:13:44.615
so take this and quit it immediately.

241
00:13:46.544 --> 00:13:48.414
What do you think I've been up to?

242
00:13:48.414 --> 00:13:51.055
You must work at a bar or have a sugar daddy.

243
00:13:51.115 --> 00:13:52.914
Hey, how can you say such a thing?

244
00:13:53.615 --> 00:13:54.884
Should I teach you a lesson?

245
00:13:54.884 --> 00:13:57.394
What would you say if you were me?

246
00:14:02.494 --> 00:14:04.435
I guess I'd think like that too.

247
00:14:05.565 --> 00:14:08.435
But I really don't need this money.

248
00:14:09.164 --> 00:14:10.805
I really got it back,

249
00:14:10.935 --> 00:14:12.975
and I'm not up to anything suspicious like that.

250
00:14:14.044 --> 00:14:15.105
But...

251
00:14:16.174 --> 00:14:17.975
I can't tell you more at the moment.

252
00:14:18.244 --> 00:14:19.274
I mean,

253
00:14:19.744 --> 00:14:21.345
I don't want to tell you.

254
00:14:21.414 --> 00:14:24.115
Why? Why don't you want to tell me?

255
00:14:24.254 --> 00:14:25.654
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

256
00:14:27.985 --> 00:14:31.455
What will you do if you had super-rich parents?

257
00:14:31.455 --> 00:14:32.524
Will you go live with them?

258
00:14:32.524 --> 00:14:33.624
No, I won't.

259
00:14:33.695 --> 00:14:35.325
What if your birth parents are not rich?

260
00:14:35.524 --> 00:14:38.335
What if they are much poorer than your parents?

261
00:14:38.695 --> 00:14:39.835
Would you still leave your parents?

262
00:14:39.935 --> 00:14:41.065
No, I wouldn't.

263
00:14:41.164 --> 00:14:42.935
So you're leaving your parents for money.

264
00:14:43.205 --> 00:14:45.335
If you choose someone for money,

265
00:14:45.335 --> 00:14:46.674
how could you call them your parents?

266
00:14:48.744 --> 00:14:52.044
I just want to tell you about it another time.

267
00:14:52.845 --> 00:14:55.544
Just know that it's not what you're thinking.

268
00:14:55.544 --> 00:14:58.215
- So don't worry and... - I can't take this.

269
00:14:59.055 --> 00:15:00.355
Let's go talk somewhere else.

270
00:15:02.955 --> 00:15:05.225
Where on earth are we going now?

271
00:15:05.424 --> 00:15:06.695
You'll see when we get there.

272
00:15:07.494 --> 00:15:08.764
Do you have feelings for me or what?

273
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.095
Why does that sound like scolding to me?

274
00:15:12.935 --> 00:15:14.705
Just give up if that's what this is about.

275
00:15:14.805 --> 00:15:16.034
We're not right for each other.

276
00:15:17.205 --> 00:15:18.435
Don't overreact.

277
00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.374
How can I like you when we met again only recently?

278
00:15:21.774 --> 00:15:23.705
Hey, you're the one who's overreacting.

279
00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:26.644
You're acting so weird right now.

280
00:15:26.644 --> 00:15:28.244
No one can beat you when it comes to...

281
00:15:28.244 --> 00:15:29.985
being nosy about friends' lives.

282
00:15:36.654 --> 00:15:38.154
Why isn't he back yet?

283
00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:55.105
- What is it? - Pardon me?

284
00:15:55.274 --> 00:15:57.414
You smile like that when you have something to say.

285
00:15:57.575 --> 00:15:59.244
You always chuckle like that.

286
00:15:59.514 --> 00:16:01.445
Well...

287
00:16:01.685 --> 00:16:03.544
I have to confess to you.

288
00:16:05.855 --> 00:16:07.485
I told someone we'd sell our bread to her cafe...

289
00:16:07.485 --> 00:16:08.884
without your permission.

290
00:16:12.855 --> 00:16:14.424
You know that bike guy, right?

291
00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:16.365
It's the only way I can see him.

292
00:16:16.365 --> 00:16:18.835
I did it because it's really the only way.

293
00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:20.865
It's where I bought this chair.

294
00:16:20.865 --> 00:16:22.004
Do it.

295
00:16:22.365 --> 00:16:24.174
- Sorry? - Sell them the bread,

296
00:16:24.774 --> 00:16:26.174
and take responsibility.

297
00:16:26.174 --> 00:16:27.874
Take responsibility? What do you mean?

298
00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:30.715
I don't want the owner to come here and complain,

299
00:16:31.345 --> 00:16:32.445
so you deliver it to them.

300
00:16:33.445 --> 00:16:34.585
Really?

301
00:16:40.115 --> 00:16:42.884
The day I see that cafe owner at my store...

302
00:16:42.924 --> 00:16:44.754
It'll be the day I'll get fired.

303
00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:57.534
You're really acting odd today.

304
00:16:58.004 --> 00:17:00.744
Why couldn't you tell me that we were coming here?

305
00:17:01.075 --> 00:17:03.144
And did we have to come all the way here to talk?

306
00:17:03.144 --> 00:17:04.575
There are many cafes nearby.

307
00:17:05.015 --> 00:17:06.845
Go get me coffee. Then I'll tell you why.

308
00:17:06.845 --> 00:17:09.944
- I should buy you coffee? - Hey, I'm a businessman.

309
00:17:11.785 --> 00:17:12.954
I want an Americano.

310
00:17:24.535 --> 00:17:26.065
Two Americanos, please.

311
00:17:36.075 --> 00:17:37.714
You want me to work here?

312
00:17:37.714 --> 00:17:39.075
We're looking for someone anyway.

313
00:17:39.414 --> 00:17:41.245
Work part-time here until you find a job.

314
00:17:42.414 --> 00:17:44.355
So that's why you brought me here.

315
00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:46.654
I can help you if you're okay with small companies.

316
00:17:50.654 --> 00:17:52.855
- You don't like the idea? - If you keep this up,

317
00:17:53.325 --> 00:17:54.894
I'll block your number.

318
00:17:55.724 --> 00:17:56.724
What?

319
00:17:56.724 --> 00:18:00.295
So stop. I don't want to lose a good friend.

320
00:18:02.005 --> 00:18:03.704
If you're really my friend,

321
00:18:04.674 --> 00:18:07.234
give me some time.

322
00:18:08.204 --> 00:18:09.474
Soon,

323
00:18:10.075 --> 00:18:11.174
I'll tell you everything.

324
00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:13.914
I should get going.

325
00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:28.325
Will you really tell me everything soon?

326
00:18:35.005 --> 00:18:36.565
He's not a boyfriend?

327
00:18:37.904 --> 00:18:40.535
She really needs to get ahold of herself.

328
00:18:48.785 --> 00:18:49.914
Oh, right.

329
00:18:50.115 --> 00:18:51.654
I'm in Yeonnam-dong now.

330
00:18:52.615 --> 00:18:54.525
The bakery Ji Soo works at is also in this area.

331
00:18:58.325 --> 00:18:59.355
What?

332
00:19:02.865 --> 00:19:04.065
Taxi!

333
00:19:25.954 --> 00:19:28.924
You just awoke a sleeping lion.

334
00:19:43.904 --> 00:19:45.575
The meeting will start in 30 minutes.

335
00:19:50.644 --> 00:19:52.615
Have fun looking for your phone.

336
00:20:01.355 --> 00:20:02.585
What should I do?

337
00:20:06.325 --> 00:20:07.795
(Revenue and Profit Chart)

338
00:20:11.934 --> 00:20:13.664
(Eun Seok)

339
00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:20.005
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

340
00:20:24.944 --> 00:20:27.545
You told me to just show her around and get back,

341
00:20:27.785 --> 00:20:29.815
so I got back right away.

342
00:20:29.884 --> 00:20:31.654
Eun Seok's phone is off.

343
00:20:32.214 --> 00:20:33.954
She's with a friend, so...

344
00:20:33.954 --> 00:20:36.484
Then why is her phone off?

345
00:20:38.525 --> 00:20:40.865
You told her to get back by 2:30pm.

346
00:20:41.194 --> 00:20:42.924
There's still 10 minutes left.

347
00:20:43.924 --> 00:20:45.795
You should still call the fitness club...

348
00:20:45.795 --> 00:20:47.605
and find out when she left.

349
00:20:48.134 --> 00:20:50.164
And call me right away if she comes home.

350
00:20:58.075 --> 00:21:00.684
Honey! Eun Seok's phone is off.

351
00:21:00.984 --> 00:21:02.345
She hasn't come home yet either.

352
00:21:02.745 --> 00:21:04.785
She said she was meeting a friend for lunch,

353
00:21:05.214 --> 00:21:06.714
and she was supposed to be back by 2:30pm.

354
00:21:06.714 --> 00:21:08.654
It's past 3pm now, but she's still not back.

355
00:21:09.025 --> 00:21:11.495
She has a lesson with Ms. Yang at 3pm.

356
00:21:11.495 --> 00:21:12.755
She hasn't even called.

357
00:21:14.365 --> 00:21:16.565
I'm sure she forgot while catching up with friends.

358
00:21:16.565 --> 00:21:18.835
I said, her phone is off!

359
00:21:20.095 --> 00:21:22.105
- Honey. - Eun Seok.

360
00:21:22.835 --> 00:21:25.335
What if she got abducted?

361
00:21:25.505 --> 00:21:26.505
What?

362
00:21:27.174 --> 00:21:28.904
What are you talking about?

363
00:21:28.904 --> 00:21:30.815
Kids these days don't leave their phones off...

364
00:21:31.045 --> 00:21:32.374
for hours like this.

365
00:21:33.275 --> 00:21:35.285
I get that she could have forgotten about it,

366
00:21:35.845 --> 00:21:37.555
but it's past 3pm, and she hasn't even called.

367
00:21:37.785 --> 00:21:39.384
It makes no sense!

368
00:21:43.424 --> 00:21:44.954
Which friend did she say she was meeting?

369
00:21:45.194 --> 00:21:46.394
I didn't ask.

370
00:21:46.924 --> 00:21:48.265
I should've asked her.

371
00:21:58.775 --> 00:22:00.134
Then let's do this, Mr. Park.

372
00:22:00.575 --> 00:22:02.904
The effort needed for the sales goal...

373
00:22:02.904 --> 00:22:04.245
is counterproductive.

374
00:22:04.914 --> 00:22:07.414
We should reach out to domestic companies first.

375
00:22:07.615 --> 00:22:09.115
If that doesn't work, let's try Guangzhou.

376
00:22:09.115 --> 00:22:10.815
And if that fails too, we should forget it.

377
00:22:11.184 --> 00:22:12.515
Okay, understood.

378
00:22:13.785 --> 00:22:14.954
Anything else?

379
00:22:17.755 --> 00:22:19.795
We should select the final proposal...

380
00:22:19.795 --> 00:22:21.164
for Haesung Apparel's anniversary event.

381
00:22:21.164 --> 00:22:22.164
(Dad)

382
00:22:22.765 --> 00:22:23.765
Let's see.

383
00:22:24.634 --> 00:22:26.495
Three of them got the same score.

384
00:22:26.634 --> 00:22:29.904
Yes, please choose one among them.

385
00:22:30.974 --> 00:22:32.434
Why did you...

386
00:22:32.434 --> 00:22:35.505
give all proposals two As...

387
00:22:35.874 --> 00:22:37.745
and ask me to make the call?

388
00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:39.545
- My gosh. - That is true.

389
00:22:43.285 --> 00:22:45.285
"Festival of Flowers".

390
00:22:45.414 --> 00:22:47.585
They'll be arranged by color?

391
00:22:48.654 --> 00:22:51.825
What about people who are allergic to flowers?

392
00:22:53.255 --> 00:22:55.464
"I Love Dogs Festival".

393
00:22:56.694 --> 00:22:59.694
A dog-only zone in the square?

394
00:23:00.194 --> 00:23:02.105
It'll get so chaotic.

395
00:23:04.634 --> 00:23:06.404
"Five Senses Project".

396
00:23:07.234 --> 00:23:08.974
Oh, this one.

397
00:23:08.974 --> 00:23:11.275
It was the best even in the preliminary screening.

398
00:23:12.015 --> 00:23:13.474
Then we'll go with that one.

399
00:23:13.474 --> 00:23:14.484
Sure.

400
00:23:47.015 --> 00:23:48.315
You want to go live with them?

401
00:23:48.884 --> 00:23:51.055
I know that things have been tough,

402
00:23:51.884 --> 00:23:54.724
but do you really want to leave us like this?

403
00:23:56.785 --> 00:23:58.154
Dad...

404
00:24:00.394 --> 00:24:03.464
When you bought those gifts for your old family,

405
00:24:03.795 --> 00:24:05.894
did you buy a single gift for our family?

406
00:24:06.164 --> 00:24:08.005
And you decided to join this family...

407
00:24:08.005 --> 00:24:09.535
when you're not even ready to call them your parents.

408
00:24:09.535 --> 00:24:10.904
You might remember.

409
00:24:11.134 --> 00:24:13.474
We've been living here even before you were born.

410
00:24:13.474 --> 00:24:15.374
We kept your room,

411
00:24:15.374 --> 00:24:17.345
but your mother just renovated it.

412
00:24:17.575 --> 00:24:18.674
Eun Seok.

413
00:24:28.055 --> 00:24:29.355
You borrowed money?

414
00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:31.995
No one would just lend you 20,000 dollars.

415
00:24:31.995 --> 00:24:34.295
But I couldn't turn a blind eye knowing...

416
00:24:34.295 --> 00:24:36.224
this would ruin your life. That's why I came back.

417
00:24:36.224 --> 00:24:37.664
I must return it to you.

418
00:24:37.664 --> 00:24:40.134
You must work at a bar or have a sugar daddy.

419
00:24:40.134 --> 00:24:41.464
It must be a loan shark.

420
00:24:41.464 --> 00:24:43.105
Who else would lend you this kind of money?

421
00:24:46.374 --> 00:24:49.305
I'm not giving this back because it's worthless.

422
00:24:49.305 --> 00:24:50.845
You should've done this earlier.

423
00:24:50.845 --> 00:24:51.845
This is who you really are.

424
00:24:51.845 --> 00:24:53.984
Why act like my brother and make me uncomfortable?

425
00:24:53.984 --> 00:24:56.714
Never mind. It must've been fun to fool me.

426
00:24:56.714 --> 00:24:57.714
Fool you?

427
00:24:57.714 --> 00:24:59.414
Is that how you describe...

428
00:24:59.414 --> 00:25:00.984
my concerns and efforts for you?

429
00:25:00.984 --> 00:25:03.154
Only beggars ask for free stuff.

430
00:25:03.154 --> 00:25:05.154
Do you want it for free or what?

431
00:25:30.815 --> 00:25:33.184
Ms. Choi seems fine.

432
00:25:33.984 --> 00:25:36.785
I'm relieved to hear that, but where has she been?

433
00:25:39.495 --> 00:25:41.164
I'm home.

434
00:25:42.865 --> 00:25:44.995
Eun Seok, did something happen?

435
00:25:45.535 --> 00:25:47.704
Where have you been?

436
00:25:48.065 --> 00:25:49.605
Your lesson was scheduled for 3pm.

437
00:25:49.605 --> 00:25:51.075
But your phone's been off.

438
00:25:52.335 --> 00:25:54.075
Oh, I'm so sorry.

439
00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:56.974
- I lost my phone. - Eun Seok.

440
00:25:59.414 --> 00:26:00.714
Thank goodness you're okay.

441
00:26:01.345 --> 00:26:02.345
Mother.

442
00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:09.855
She just lost her phone.

443
00:26:12.255 --> 00:26:13.755
Even if you lost your phone,

444
00:26:13.755 --> 00:26:15.265
you could've called us.

445
00:26:15.265 --> 00:26:16.464
And what about your lesson?

446
00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:19.365
I was preoccupied with finding my phone.

447
00:26:20.134 --> 00:26:23.134
From my contact list to photos and notes,

448
00:26:23.704 --> 00:26:25.704
it has so many important things,

449
00:26:26.535 --> 00:26:29.374
so I totally forgot about the lesson.

450
00:26:29.374 --> 00:26:31.775
Did you not think about how worried I'd be?

451
00:26:32.015 --> 00:26:33.345
Thinking something might've happened...

452
00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:35.384
made me so anxious and worried.

453
00:26:35.384 --> 00:26:37.015
I thought I might lose you again.

454
00:26:38.454 --> 00:26:39.585
I'm sorry.

455
00:26:42.984 --> 00:26:45.894
From now on, you're not allowed to go out alone.

456
00:26:45.954 --> 00:26:47.525
Mr. Myung must accompany you at all times.

457
00:26:52.464 --> 00:26:53.565
Why aren't you answering?

458
00:26:55.105 --> 00:26:56.365
Okay.

459
00:27:01.775 --> 00:27:02.974
Do Kyung, you're home.

460
00:27:03.105 --> 00:27:06.174
Yes, I got your message telling me to rush home.

461
00:27:06.174 --> 00:27:07.714
I heard you were in a meeting.

462
00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:09.984
We couldn't contact Eun Seok,

463
00:27:09.984 --> 00:27:11.855
so your mom was very worried.

464
00:27:12.484 --> 00:27:14.525
I asked you to rush home just in case.

465
00:27:14.525 --> 00:27:16.424
Mom almost fainted.

466
00:27:17.124 --> 00:27:18.124
Really?

467
00:27:20.194 --> 00:27:22.164
Mom, are you okay?

468
00:27:22.595 --> 00:27:24.664
Do Kyung, spare me a second.

469
00:27:34.644 --> 00:27:35.845
Behave yourself.

470
00:27:36.374 --> 00:27:38.874
And break up with that guy before Mom finds out.

471
00:27:39.775 --> 00:27:40.984
I'm sorry.

472
00:27:44.255 --> 00:27:46.815
I should've been more thoughtful.

473
00:27:47.525 --> 00:27:49.424
And about everything you said yesterday.

474
00:27:50.454 --> 00:27:52.654
- You were right. - I don't care.

475
00:27:53.325 --> 00:27:55.694
Whether you're thoughtless or sly,

476
00:27:55.724 --> 00:27:57.394
it doesn't matter to me.

477
00:27:57.934 --> 00:27:59.595
Just don't break our family rules.

478
00:28:00.664 --> 00:28:02.164
You can ignore me all you want.

479
00:28:02.934 --> 00:28:06.404
One more thing. I don't have a boyfriend.

480
00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:27.894
Gosh, I'm so glad I found this.

481
00:28:38.374 --> 00:28:39.634
In your purse,

482
00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:41.204
you'll find an envelope with a check.

483
00:28:41.704 --> 00:28:44.515
I'm asking you this as an old friend of yours.

484
00:28:44.775 --> 00:28:46.115
Pay that person back,

485
00:28:46.115 --> 00:28:47.884
and live a better life, Ji An.

486
00:29:02.995 --> 00:29:04.035
Hey, Ji Ho!

487
00:29:05.035 --> 00:29:06.065
- Hey. - Gosh.

488
00:29:06.835 --> 00:29:09.765
- What is it? - You're still sleeping?

489
00:29:11.575 --> 00:29:12.934
Did you just get back from the gym?

490
00:29:14.974 --> 00:29:18.015
Hey, will you hang out here on your days off?

491
00:29:18.174 --> 00:29:19.374
You should go out.

492
00:29:19.374 --> 00:29:22.144
Go out, and look around. It's a nice day.

493
00:29:22.144 --> 00:29:24.714
I've been so stressed out because of my family.

494
00:29:25.515 --> 00:29:26.585
I guess it burnt me out.

495
00:29:26.585 --> 00:29:28.355
Gosh, I'm so sick of this.

496
00:29:31.894 --> 00:29:33.124
You must think I'm a nuisance.

497
00:29:33.124 --> 00:29:34.164
Yes.

498
00:29:34.164 --> 00:29:36.724
I always stay at your place on our days off.

499
00:29:38.835 --> 00:29:41.265
Hey, it's not a nuisance,

500
00:29:42.005 --> 00:29:43.765
but it's been months.

501
00:29:43.765 --> 00:29:45.704
Don't you think you should find a place?

502
00:29:46.105 --> 00:29:47.944
What do you say? Don't you have savings?

503
00:29:47.944 --> 00:29:51.115
Gosh, that's my seed money to start a business.

504
00:29:52.815 --> 00:29:54.315
I'm so stressed out too.

505
00:29:54.315 --> 00:29:56.085
I work at the department store and serve too.

506
00:29:56.144 --> 00:29:58.585
Every morning, I have to leave at 8am for my class.

507
00:29:59.454 --> 00:30:00.785
It's exhausting.

508
00:30:01.224 --> 00:30:03.325
My parents think that I'm doing nothing but study.

509
00:30:03.755 --> 00:30:05.495
How can I get my own place?

510
00:30:05.495 --> 00:30:08.394
Tell them that you don't want to waste your time.

511
00:30:08.394 --> 00:30:10.424
Until the college entrance exam or something,

512
00:30:10.424 --> 00:30:12.335
you should rent a room in a gosiwon or something.

513
00:30:12.595 --> 00:30:14.065
Right, gosiwon.

514
00:30:14.065 --> 00:30:15.664
Why haven't I thought of that?

515
00:30:16.035 --> 00:30:17.404
Hallelujah.

516
00:30:17.505 --> 00:30:20.105
Those rooms are pretty nice these days.

517
00:30:20.105 --> 00:30:22.204
On your days off,

518
00:30:22.204 --> 00:30:24.474
you can sleep all day long, right?

519
00:30:24.474 --> 00:30:26.874
Totally. It's a great idea.

520
00:30:28.914 --> 00:30:31.285
Haesung has done its best for the last 40 years.

521
00:30:31.285 --> 00:30:33.454
What was that? Anyway, I need to take a shower.

522
00:30:33.454 --> 00:30:35.355
Can you tidy up, please?

523
00:30:35.424 --> 00:30:37.954
- I'll be right back. - Yes, sir.

524
00:30:41.795 --> 00:30:44.234
Look at that. It's Ji An's parents' company.

525
00:30:44.664 --> 00:30:48.605
Well, let me hear what it's like to live there.

526
00:30:49.105 --> 00:30:50.234
Dear lady.

527
00:30:51.805 --> 00:30:54.305
The number you've dialed is out of service.

528
00:30:54.305 --> 00:30:55.345
I called the right number.

529
00:30:57.745 --> 00:31:00.374
- The number you've... - No way.

530
00:31:01.184 --> 00:31:03.214
Did she change her number?

531
00:31:04.255 --> 00:31:05.384
As soon as she moved there?

532
00:31:05.384 --> 00:31:06.884
She didn't even tell me.

533
00:31:08.954 --> 00:31:11.124
First message.

534
00:31:11.555 --> 00:31:13.825
Dad, it's me, Ji An.

535
00:31:15.795 --> 00:31:18.035
Did you arrive in Daejeon safely?

536
00:31:20.595 --> 00:31:22.265
I'm sorry about earlier.

537
00:31:27.805 --> 00:31:29.045
Earlier, I was...

538
00:31:34.015 --> 00:31:35.015
I was so...

539
00:31:36.615 --> 00:31:39.315
I felt so bad, and I took it out on you.

540
00:31:40.515 --> 00:31:44.654
I don't resent you like that. I really don't.

541
00:31:46.095 --> 00:31:49.595
You've been so good to me and all of us.

542
00:31:49.595 --> 00:31:51.095
You've been such a great dad.

543
00:31:52.464 --> 00:31:53.964
I know all of that,

544
00:31:55.434 --> 00:31:57.335
so I feel horrible about saying I'd live with them,

545
00:31:58.835 --> 00:32:00.644
but it's what I want to do.

546
00:32:02.005 --> 00:32:03.874
It looked like you were trying to stop me.

547
00:32:03.874 --> 00:32:05.414
That's why I got mad at you.

548
00:32:09.545 --> 00:32:10.914
I'll go there...

549
00:32:12.255 --> 00:32:14.785
so that I can get out of my current situation.

550
00:32:15.424 --> 00:32:16.585
Right now,

551
00:32:17.255 --> 00:32:19.654
I just can't hold up any longer.

552
00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:22.865
I don't want to fall apart like this.

553
00:32:25.394 --> 00:32:26.964
I love you, Dad.

554
00:32:28.005 --> 00:32:29.404
I love you, Dad.

555
00:32:30.974 --> 00:32:31.974
And...

556
00:32:33.075 --> 00:32:34.174
stay healthy.

557
00:32:43.785 --> 00:32:46.255
He doesn't call and only listens again.

558
00:32:46.555 --> 00:32:48.684
What are you listening to?

559
00:32:50.454 --> 00:32:52.855
Why are you working already?

560
00:32:52.855 --> 00:32:54.365
It's break time.

561
00:32:54.365 --> 00:32:57.865
I'm going to Seoul today. I need to finish my part.

562
00:32:57.865 --> 00:32:58.964
Don't worry.

563
00:32:59.565 --> 00:33:00.734
Gosh.

564
00:33:02.934 --> 00:33:06.105
I believe we first met. I'm Kim Sung Min.

565
00:33:06.404 --> 00:33:08.745
Likewise. I'm Lee Soo A.

566
00:33:09.745 --> 00:33:11.015
Likewise?

567
00:33:13.474 --> 00:33:14.984
I believe that we first met too.

568
00:33:16.245 --> 00:33:17.484
You are humorous.

569
00:33:19.055 --> 00:33:21.384
By the way, you look young for your age.

570
00:33:21.755 --> 00:33:24.394
That's because I'm immature and reckless.

571
00:33:24.954 --> 00:33:26.995
Maybe I should become immature and reckless...

572
00:33:27.194 --> 00:33:29.224
to look young like you.

573
00:33:29.964 --> 00:33:31.634
I have too many thoughts on my mind.

574
00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:33.964
It is of no use having a lot on your mind.

575
00:33:34.535 --> 00:33:36.634
You reach for the stars, but you'll just grab dirt.

576
00:33:38.775 --> 00:33:40.404
Maybe that's not for you.

577
00:33:41.474 --> 00:33:42.775
I heard you're an accountant.

578
00:33:43.874 --> 00:33:45.674
- We are now much younger. - Okay.

579
00:33:46.815 --> 00:33:48.414
We look forward to serve more youngsters.

580
00:33:48.845 --> 00:33:51.585
We'll be your companion when you are in need.

581
00:33:52.555 --> 00:33:53.684
Mr. Seo.

582
00:33:54.255 --> 00:33:56.085
People aren't receiving flyers.

583
00:33:56.424 --> 00:33:59.995
We do the same thing when we go out for lunch.

584
00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:02.394
- What should we do then? - Don't ask me.

585
00:34:02.394 --> 00:34:03.495
Just make them receive it.

586
00:34:05.595 --> 00:34:07.134
Are you interested in Taoism?

587
00:34:07.134 --> 00:34:08.335
- Not really. - Then...

588
00:34:08.335 --> 00:34:10.265
- how about a cooperative? - Pardon?

589
00:34:10.975 --> 00:34:12.805
We're a young cooperative.

590
00:34:13.075 --> 00:34:14.705
We're here to say hello to young people.

591
00:34:15.004 --> 00:34:17.345
We even have a special offer for young people.

592
00:34:17.345 --> 00:34:19.415
- Okay. - Thank you.

593
00:34:19.745 --> 00:34:21.814
We give warm advice for young people.

594
00:34:22.714 --> 00:34:24.455
It's been only three days,

595
00:34:24.515 --> 00:34:26.854
but we got this contract worth 670,000 dollars.

596
00:34:27.154 --> 00:34:29.225
So how much do we promise?

597
00:34:29.685 --> 00:34:31.694
100 percent in 10 weeks!

598
00:34:31.924 --> 00:34:34.694
You'll get your money back in two and a half months.

599
00:34:34.765 --> 00:34:36.265
Do you think that'd be it?

600
00:34:37.334 --> 00:34:39.765
Do you know how many kinds...

601
00:34:39.765 --> 00:34:41.904
of health-functional foods the foundation...

602
00:34:41.904 --> 00:34:42.964
exports to Vietnam with us?

603
00:34:43.305 --> 00:34:44.504
It's lucky seven.

604
00:34:46.205 --> 00:34:47.645
It's seven!

605
00:34:47.975 --> 00:34:49.375
Once those seven...

606
00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:51.674
health-functional foods are exported to Vietnam,

607
00:34:52.075 --> 00:34:55.544
you won't be able to see your family a lot. Why?

608
00:34:55.785 --> 00:34:58.254
Because you'll have too much money to spend.

609
00:35:00.725 --> 00:35:01.754
Really?

610
00:35:02.524 --> 00:35:05.225
Sir, where are you going?

611
00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:06.895
I'm going home.

612
00:35:06.955 --> 00:35:10.095
It'll end in 10 minutes. You don't want to miss it.

613
00:35:10.095 --> 00:35:11.995
A profit of 100 percent in 10 weeks?

614
00:35:12.395 --> 00:35:15.064
Do you still delude people with that nonsense?

615
00:35:15.765 --> 00:35:17.834
What age do you think we are living in?

616
00:35:18.435 --> 00:35:19.904
We are your warm neighbors.

617
00:35:19.935 --> 00:35:22.674
Who's neighbors? Neighbors of young people. Thanks.

618
00:35:23.305 --> 00:35:25.674
We are now a much younger cooperative. Thank you.

619
00:35:26.245 --> 00:35:29.044
I'm going to open a nail salon.

620
00:35:29.044 --> 00:35:32.214
Can I get a loan at this bank?

621
00:35:32.214 --> 00:35:33.354
Of course.

622
00:35:33.915 --> 00:35:36.754
I'm Seo Ji Tae. Please visit our branch later.

623
00:35:36.754 --> 00:35:38.955
- Gosh. Thank you. - Thank you.

624
00:35:41.365 --> 00:35:42.495
Mr. Seo.

625
00:35:43.095 --> 00:35:44.734
Is this about appearance?

626
00:35:45.194 --> 00:35:47.334
Appearance does give you a competitive edge.

627
00:35:47.535 --> 00:35:49.464
I'll show you how competence...

628
00:35:49.535 --> 00:35:50.705
outdoes appearance.

629
00:35:51.134 --> 00:35:54.174
I'll be somewhere else. See you in 30 minutes.

630
00:35:55.645 --> 00:35:57.415
I'll leave once I'm done.

631
00:36:23.535 --> 00:36:24.734
I'm Seo Ji Tae.

632
00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:28.345
I'm glad to meet you. I'm Lee Soo A.

633
00:36:28.674 --> 00:36:30.174
Are you glad to meet me? We just met.

634
00:36:31.015 --> 00:36:34.044
We might say goodbye like bitter foes as we go home.

635
00:36:34.515 --> 00:36:37.354
I'm sure that will never happen.

636
00:36:37.354 --> 00:36:38.984
That's why I said I was glad to see you.

637
00:37:06.774 --> 00:37:08.415
Hey, Jang Seok Doo.

638
00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:10.345
How could you do this to me?

639
00:37:11.714 --> 00:37:14.254
I don't even need to talk. Forget about investment.

640
00:37:15.785 --> 00:37:17.854
Let's talk in person. I'll be right there.

641
00:37:19.294 --> 00:37:22.765
Maybe this is why he told me to go there alone.

642
00:37:23.595 --> 00:37:24.964
What a jerk.

643
00:37:26.734 --> 00:37:29.935
The wine bar is nearby. I'll leave the car here.

644
00:37:30.234 --> 00:37:31.404
Okay.

645
00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:35.104
If we go to the wine bar after this restaurant,

646
00:37:35.104 --> 00:37:36.345
we're likely to...

647
00:37:38.115 --> 00:37:39.245
Soo A?

648
00:37:42.084 --> 00:37:43.345
Do you know him?

649
00:37:44.685 --> 00:37:47.115
- No. Let's go. - Okay.

650
00:37:48.424 --> 00:37:49.584
Hey, Lee Soo A!

651
00:37:51.254 --> 00:37:52.424
Soo A!

652
00:37:57.194 --> 00:37:58.694
Hey, Mr. Eligible Bachelor,

653
00:37:58.895 --> 00:38:01.064
are you interested in a girl playing double?

654
00:38:01.634 --> 00:38:03.464
If so, you can stay here and watch this.

655
00:38:04.134 --> 00:38:05.334
Soo A.

656
00:38:08.875 --> 00:38:10.104
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:10.575 --> 00:38:11.975
Goodbye.

658
00:38:22.285 --> 00:38:24.595
- What are you doing here? - What about you?

659
00:38:25.225 --> 00:38:26.625
You said you were working late.

660
00:38:27.424 --> 00:38:29.165
Are you working overtime in Hongdae?

661
00:38:29.265 --> 00:38:31.234
- Were you spying on me? - What were you doing?

662
00:38:32.265 --> 00:38:34.665
You lied to me to go on a blind date?

663
00:38:34.665 --> 00:38:35.734
And at the coffee shop...

664
00:38:36.535 --> 00:38:37.975
where we first met?

665
00:38:38.234 --> 00:38:39.674
He decided where to meet.

666
00:38:40.435 --> 00:38:43.544
You know it is a popular place for blind dates.

667
00:38:43.544 --> 00:38:45.145
Do you think that's what I'm talking about?

668
00:38:46.345 --> 00:38:47.515
That day,

669
00:38:48.415 --> 00:38:50.115
you said I was snobby...

670
00:38:50.654 --> 00:38:52.285
just because I ordered lobster.

671
00:38:53.254 --> 00:38:55.225
But when I told him to split the check,

672
00:38:55.225 --> 00:38:56.625
he offered to pay for dinner.

673
00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:59.154
Do you call that an excuse for this situation?

674
00:39:00.024 --> 00:39:02.995
You just got caught cheating.

675
00:39:02.995 --> 00:39:04.294
What's wrong about that?

676
00:39:04.834 --> 00:39:06.365
I thought we'd agreed on this.

677
00:39:06.464 --> 00:39:08.435
It's okay to see someone else.

678
00:39:08.705 --> 00:39:10.004
You said you'd be fine with that.

679
00:39:10.004 --> 00:39:11.305
But we didn't break up!

680
00:39:11.575 --> 00:39:12.805
Is that what we had to do?

681
00:39:13.035 --> 00:39:15.604
I thought I could see anyone else anytime.

682
00:39:19.314 --> 00:39:20.415
- Hey. - Let go of me.

683
00:39:20.714 --> 00:39:22.714
- Lee Soo A! - What?

684
00:39:23.044 --> 00:39:25.884
Hey! Hey, Lee Soo A!

685
00:39:25.884 --> 00:39:27.555
You don't deserve to get mad at me.

686
00:39:28.325 --> 00:39:30.254
I want to get married.

687
00:39:30.555 --> 00:39:33.924
But you don't. You said you'd never get married.

688
00:39:33.924 --> 00:39:36.625
Soo A, you also said you'd never get married.

689
00:39:36.625 --> 00:39:39.134
Didn't you know what I really meant?

690
00:39:39.564 --> 00:39:41.104
That's why I went on a blind date.

691
00:39:41.705 --> 00:39:43.165
You scumbag.

692
00:39:43.365 --> 00:39:45.174
When I said I'd go to Canada for a blind date,

693
00:39:45.205 --> 00:39:46.205
you were fine with it.

694
00:39:46.205 --> 00:39:47.604
That's because I knew you wouldn't go.

695
00:39:48.044 --> 00:39:49.604
You don't want to live abroad.

696
00:39:49.604 --> 00:39:52.044
So you stayed here when your parents emigrated.

697
00:39:52.044 --> 00:39:53.774
You told me to just give you a call...

698
00:39:54.285 --> 00:39:56.444
if I liked my date in Canada.

699
00:39:56.845 --> 00:39:59.115
- That's what you said! - I know.

700
00:39:59.884 --> 00:40:00.884
I did.

701
00:40:01.055 --> 00:40:03.285
I just said it because I trusted you.

702
00:40:03.524 --> 00:40:05.825
But I did say that.

703
00:40:06.354 --> 00:40:08.225
So what? Did you go to Canada?

704
00:40:08.395 --> 00:40:10.424
- Are we in Canada now? - What's the difference?

705
00:40:10.895 --> 00:40:12.834
What difference does it make?

706
00:40:13.895 --> 00:40:15.634
You told me to go on a blind date.

707
00:40:16.035 --> 00:40:18.575
You told me to see someone else whenever I wanted.

708
00:40:19.004 --> 00:40:20.274
Why are you making a fuss now?

709
00:40:22.645 --> 00:40:24.145
Is it because I didn't tell you beforehand?

710
00:40:25.044 --> 00:40:26.845
All right. I'm sorry.

711
00:40:27.544 --> 00:40:29.845
I'm sorry about that. Are you happy now?

712
00:40:30.444 --> 00:40:32.455
- No, I'm not. - What?

713
00:40:32.654 --> 00:40:34.154
"I don't..."

714
00:40:35.154 --> 00:40:36.555
"love you anymore."

715
00:40:37.395 --> 00:40:39.194
"I don't have feelings for you anymore."

716
00:40:40.125 --> 00:40:41.165
You...

717
00:40:41.895 --> 00:40:43.365
didn't say any of that.

718
00:40:44.895 --> 00:40:45.895
Say it.

719
00:40:46.365 --> 00:40:47.634
Only then will everything be over.

720
00:40:48.234 --> 00:40:49.665
Just break up with me,

721
00:40:50.734 --> 00:40:52.134
and do whatever you want.

722
00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:55.104
- As we promised. - Really...

723
00:40:56.504 --> 00:40:58.145
You don't love me, do you?

724
00:40:59.845 --> 00:41:02.785
That's right. You can't do this to me if you love me.

725
00:41:04.955 --> 00:41:07.154
Say it before you leave.

726
00:41:11.924 --> 00:41:15.125
Your family can't even afford a single room.

727
00:41:16.024 --> 00:41:18.095
But you always try to be a good son.

728
00:41:18.895 --> 00:41:20.865
- I don't like it. - So?

729
00:41:21.964 --> 00:41:23.464
So you don't have feelings for me anymore?

730
00:41:24.705 --> 00:41:25.975
You're a jerk.

731
00:41:26.935 --> 00:41:28.274
Say it before you leave!

732
00:41:28.674 --> 00:41:30.774
- Gosh. - What just happened?

733
00:41:31.314 --> 00:41:32.475
Soo A.

734
00:41:35.484 --> 00:41:38.084
You idiot! You jerk!

735
00:41:39.555 --> 00:41:40.854
What do you want me to say?

736
00:41:41.584 --> 00:41:42.884
What am I supposed to say?

737
00:41:43.325 --> 00:41:45.395
How could you do this to me?

738
00:41:54.104 --> 00:41:55.305
All right.

739
00:41:57.165 --> 00:41:58.305
That's enough.

740
00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:01.745
Go.

741
00:42:02.745 --> 00:42:04.075
Just leave!

742
00:42:04.845 --> 00:42:07.384
You're right. I'll never get married!

743
00:42:07.745 --> 00:42:09.214
I don't want to get married.

744
00:42:10.685 --> 00:42:12.984
I'm the oldest son of a poor family.

745
00:42:14.084 --> 00:42:15.884
I'm hopeless, so I'll never get married.

746
00:42:17.555 --> 00:42:18.955
I just can't...

747
00:42:19.854 --> 00:42:22.424
pass down my poverty to my own children.

748
00:42:23.225 --> 00:42:24.435
So I won't get married.

749
00:42:25.765 --> 00:42:27.265
You, Lee Soo A.

750
00:42:28.404 --> 00:42:30.904
I can't afford an apartment you want.

751
00:42:31.634 --> 00:42:33.004
So I won't get married.

752
00:42:33.075 --> 00:42:34.504
I won't ever!

753
00:42:39.714 --> 00:42:40.944
So...

754
00:42:45.314 --> 00:42:46.384
go.

755
00:44:23.345 --> 00:44:24.455
Tae Soo.

756
00:44:24.754 --> 00:44:27.325
How bad was it that you won't say a word?

757
00:44:27.325 --> 00:44:28.584
It's been an hour.

758
00:44:30.754 --> 00:44:32.055
Let's eat.

759
00:44:32.524 --> 00:44:35.265
He didn't make 670,000 dollars in 3 days,

760
00:44:35.265 --> 00:44:36.765
but he did make a lot.

761
00:44:37.464 --> 00:44:39.694
And they are exporting to Hanoi.

762
00:44:39.694 --> 00:44:41.734
That's why I was interested.

763
00:44:43.604 --> 00:44:46.234
Did he go too far to get investors?

764
00:44:46.234 --> 00:44:47.234
Seok Doo.

765
00:44:48.674 --> 00:44:50.504
When we worked together,

766
00:44:51.174 --> 00:44:53.575
I did better than you, didn't I?

767
00:44:54.645 --> 00:44:57.285
Why are you mentioning those days?

768
00:44:57.285 --> 00:44:59.714
Of course you did better. Much better.

769
00:44:59.714 --> 00:45:02.084
When we left to start our own businesses,

770
00:45:02.984 --> 00:45:04.854
I helped you out a lot.

771
00:45:05.754 --> 00:45:07.895
You sent a lot of your clients to me.

772
00:45:07.895 --> 00:45:10.935
If I hadn't gone bankrupt then,

773
00:45:11.935 --> 00:45:14.234
wouldn't I be doing quite well right now?

774
00:45:14.805 --> 00:45:16.464
You bet.

775
00:45:16.464 --> 00:45:19.334
That's why I suggested we go to Vietnam together.

776
00:45:21.174 --> 00:45:22.205
Back then...

777
00:45:23.174 --> 00:45:24.674
I was too afraid.

778
00:45:25.714 --> 00:45:26.814
You were afraid?

779
00:45:27.384 --> 00:45:28.944
When Min Sang...

780
00:45:28.944 --> 00:45:31.785
disappeared with all the company's money,

781
00:45:32.984 --> 00:45:35.024
I hit rock bottom overnight.

782
00:45:35.384 --> 00:45:36.455
My kids.

783
00:45:36.884 --> 00:45:39.095
I had four kids to feed.

784
00:45:40.294 --> 00:45:42.165
Ji Tae was in university,

785
00:45:42.225 --> 00:45:44.595
Ji An and Ji Soo were in high school,

786
00:45:44.595 --> 00:45:46.035
Ji Ho was in middle school.

787
00:45:47.834 --> 00:45:50.564
Kids their age can and need to eat well.

788
00:45:50.875 --> 00:45:52.935
We fled Seoul to avoid the creditors...

789
00:45:53.134 --> 00:45:55.104
and stayed in Masan and Busan.

790
00:45:56.645 --> 00:45:58.075
I was so afraid.

791
00:45:59.245 --> 00:46:01.245
I was over 50 then, and if...

792
00:46:01.745 --> 00:46:03.685
I started over and failed again,

793
00:46:04.254 --> 00:46:06.314
I was sure my family would starve.

794
00:46:07.654 --> 00:46:10.694
So why do you want to start again now?

795
00:46:10.694 --> 00:46:11.924
You're over 60.

796
00:46:12.995 --> 00:46:14.125
I should've...

797
00:46:15.225 --> 00:46:17.535
tried to start over back then.

798
00:46:18.395 --> 00:46:19.964
I should've taken the plunge.

799
00:46:22.334 --> 00:46:23.435
Mr. Jang.

800
00:46:24.604 --> 00:46:26.774
What has happened to me?

801
00:46:27.944 --> 00:46:30.714
I never rested a day since I got married.

802
00:46:31.444 --> 00:46:33.345
I ran and kept on running.

803
00:46:36.615 --> 00:46:37.685
I am...

804
00:46:38.714 --> 00:46:41.654
the most worthless dad in the world.

805
00:46:44.625 --> 00:46:47.325
Is that bean sprout kimchi ramyeon?

806
00:46:48.095 --> 00:46:50.265
I'll make one more.

807
00:46:50.365 --> 00:46:51.995
I'll eat this then.

808
00:46:52.294 --> 00:46:54.535
That's typically you, little big sis.

809
00:46:55.035 --> 00:46:56.464
I'm your only big sis.

810
00:46:56.464 --> 00:46:58.035
Ji An's gone.

811
00:46:58.104 --> 00:47:00.604
Have you heard from her?

812
00:47:01.575 --> 00:47:03.245
Why would she call me?

813
00:47:03.975 --> 00:47:06.415
Did she change her number on purpose?

814
00:47:06.475 --> 00:47:08.984
I called and her number doesn't exist.

815
00:47:11.884 --> 00:47:13.654
You're eating ramyeon so late?

816
00:47:13.654 --> 00:47:15.984
Mom, has Ji An called you?

817
00:47:20.055 --> 00:47:21.194
Come in.

818
00:47:24.634 --> 00:47:26.334
What are you wearing?

819
00:47:26.895 --> 00:47:28.334
Change into your pajamas.

820
00:47:29.464 --> 00:47:33.234
It's what I wear to bed. It's more comfortable.

821
00:47:33.234 --> 00:47:34.805
You can't go with comfort.

822
00:47:34.805 --> 00:47:36.645
You must stick to formalities.

823
00:47:36.944 --> 00:47:38.814
Nothing comes without effort.

824
00:47:39.915 --> 00:47:41.484
I'll put in some effort.

825
00:47:41.484 --> 00:47:43.785
I'll change after you leave.

826
00:47:45.555 --> 00:47:48.354
Let's sleep together tonight.

827
00:47:48.685 --> 00:47:49.754
What?

828
00:47:50.055 --> 00:47:51.225
Just for tonight.

829
00:47:52.024 --> 00:47:53.924
Okay.

830
00:48:12.245 --> 00:48:13.274
You've had...

831
00:48:14.745 --> 00:48:16.444
a hard time so far.

832
00:48:21.884 --> 00:48:23.055
Never once...

833
00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:26.395
did I forget you.

834
00:48:55.055 --> 00:48:56.154
Mom.

835
00:48:58.654 --> 00:49:00.395
Sleep with me tonight.

836
00:49:01.424 --> 00:49:02.524
You aren't asleep?

837
00:49:03.464 --> 00:49:04.595
Did I wake you?

838
00:49:05.865 --> 00:49:07.665
Sleep with me.

839
00:49:07.665 --> 00:49:09.665
Just for tonight, okay?

840
00:49:12.375 --> 00:49:13.435
Okay.

841
00:49:19.615 --> 00:49:20.745
Ji Soo.

842
00:49:21.314 --> 00:49:22.415
Yes, Mom?

843
00:49:24.785 --> 00:49:26.455
Are you happy?

844
00:49:27.154 --> 00:49:28.225
Yes.

845
00:49:29.285 --> 00:49:31.694
Never once in my life...

846
00:49:31.694 --> 00:49:33.555
was I unhappy until now.

847
00:49:36.765 --> 00:49:38.535
But now, I'm unhappy.

848
00:49:39.595 --> 00:49:41.134
Because Ji An's gone.

849
00:50:28.044 --> 00:50:29.185
Did I...

850
00:50:29.785 --> 00:50:31.384
sleep with her?

851
00:50:44.035 --> 00:50:45.995
Did you sleep...

852
00:51:01.245 --> 00:51:03.645
How did you like sleeping with your mom?

853
00:51:04.314 --> 00:51:06.884
Mom, did you sleep with Eun Seok?

854
00:51:07.354 --> 00:51:09.024
I was so jealous.

855
00:51:09.225 --> 00:51:12.125
Honey, can I sleep with her for a night?

856
00:51:12.225 --> 00:51:15.225
She is your daughter, but she's grown up.

857
00:51:15.964 --> 00:51:17.495
I was just kidding.

858
00:51:18.234 --> 00:51:19.634
It was a joke.

859
00:51:19.865 --> 00:51:21.035
I know.

860
00:51:21.805 --> 00:51:24.705
I like sleeping with Mom.

861
00:51:26.004 --> 00:51:27.035
Eun Seok.

862
00:51:27.035 --> 00:51:29.475
I said you mustn't talk with your mouth full.

863
00:51:35.145 --> 00:51:36.544
Sorry.

864
00:51:37.214 --> 00:51:40.924
Seo Hyun, you can stop pointing things out now.

865
00:51:40.924 --> 00:51:43.154
She'll start her lessons today.

866
00:51:43.154 --> 00:51:45.024
Oh, okay.

867
00:51:45.395 --> 00:51:46.995
Will she be taught...

868
00:51:46.995 --> 00:51:49.424
not to wash her clothes...

869
00:51:49.665 --> 00:51:50.995
in the bathroom?

870
00:51:53.165 --> 00:51:54.734
Did you wash your clothes?

871
00:51:55.464 --> 00:51:58.134
That's what I used to do before.

872
00:51:58.134 --> 00:51:59.774
If you do all that,

873
00:51:59.774 --> 00:52:02.075
why would we hire helpers?

874
00:52:02.705 --> 00:52:05.145
Don't you know what not to do?

875
00:52:05.845 --> 00:52:07.384
I'll be more careful.

876
00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:16.225
Seo Hyun.

877
00:52:18.254 --> 00:52:20.895
You don't have a lecture this morning.

878
00:52:21.165 --> 00:52:23.765
Shall we have some tea?

879
00:52:25.064 --> 00:52:26.234
Sure.

880
00:52:35.004 --> 00:52:36.845
You're a cello major.

881
00:52:37.444 --> 00:52:39.075
What'll you do after you graduate?

882
00:52:39.075 --> 00:52:41.115
I'll go and study at The Juilliard School.

883
00:52:41.584 --> 00:52:42.814
The Juilliard School?

884
00:52:43.145 --> 00:52:44.955
That sounds great.

885
00:52:45.254 --> 00:52:47.825
- Will you be a musician? - No.

886
00:52:48.584 --> 00:52:50.725
After about a year in New York,

887
00:52:50.725 --> 00:52:52.125
I'll meet New World Group's chairman's...

888
00:52:52.125 --> 00:52:53.754
second son who studies at NYU.

889
00:52:54.325 --> 00:52:55.665
We'll meet at a showing of "Cats" or...

890
00:52:55.665 --> 00:52:57.194
"Phantom of the Opera"...

891
00:52:57.194 --> 00:52:59.194
and fall in love like destiny.

892
00:53:00.334 --> 00:53:02.035
What do you mean?

893
00:53:02.265 --> 00:53:04.375
We'll get engaged, I'll get...

894
00:53:04.375 --> 00:53:05.975
a Master's, and then married.

895
00:53:06.375 --> 00:53:07.805
It's all set up.

896
00:53:07.904 --> 00:53:09.805
I'll marry into New World Group.

897
00:53:11.774 --> 00:53:14.115
You don't know the man yet.

898
00:53:14.115 --> 00:53:16.345
You don't know if you'll like him.

899
00:53:16.345 --> 00:53:17.854
I will like him.

900
00:53:19.654 --> 00:53:21.125
I finished my tea.

901
00:53:21.424 --> 00:53:22.654
May I leave now?

902
00:53:22.785 --> 00:53:24.524
What? Oh, sure.

903
00:53:25.854 --> 00:53:28.464
You don't have to be so polite to me.

904
00:53:28.464 --> 00:53:30.294
Speak freely.

905
00:53:30.964 --> 00:53:32.035
Why?

906
00:53:32.765 --> 00:53:34.305
So we can get closer.

907
00:53:34.765 --> 00:53:36.165
Let's become close.

908
00:53:36.935 --> 00:53:39.274
How? We have nothing in common.

909
00:53:40.075 --> 00:53:42.404
I hope you get settled soon.

910
00:53:47.884 --> 00:53:50.484
Does that mean she doesn't want to be close?

911
00:53:52.154 --> 00:53:54.225
- Miss? - Yes?

912
00:53:56.455 --> 00:53:59.294
Your mother says you can use this phone.

913
00:53:59.455 --> 00:54:00.895
Is that so?

914
00:54:00.895 --> 00:54:03.265
Then I'll go and get it registered.

915
00:54:03.265 --> 00:54:05.035
I didn't get to report the other one missing yet.

916
00:54:05.035 --> 00:54:06.464
That one's registered.

917
00:54:08.004 --> 00:54:10.334
Give me your ID, and I'll cancel your phone.

918
00:54:10.404 --> 00:54:12.174
But that means...

919
00:54:12.174 --> 00:54:14.845
my number will change.

920
00:54:15.044 --> 00:54:18.115
I just do as Ms. No says.

921
00:54:18.944 --> 00:54:20.814
Your teacher will be here soon.

922
00:54:20.915 --> 00:54:22.245
You must stay at home.

923
00:54:23.645 --> 00:54:25.354
Okay, then.

924
00:54:28.625 --> 00:54:30.995
(Mom)

925
00:54:31.625 --> 00:54:32.895
(Mom)

926
00:54:36.865 --> 00:54:37.995
Hello?

927
00:54:38.665 --> 00:54:41.134
Mom, it's me, Ji An.

928
00:54:41.535 --> 00:54:42.834
Ji An.

929
00:54:44.205 --> 00:54:46.174
I lost my phone and they got me a new one...

930
00:54:46.174 --> 00:54:48.044
with a new number.

931
00:54:48.645 --> 00:54:50.004
Oh, I see.

932
00:54:50.604 --> 00:54:52.745
Give Dad, Ji Tae, and Ji Ho...

933
00:54:52.745 --> 00:54:54.015
my new number.

934
00:54:54.015 --> 00:54:55.245
I'll call Ji Soo.

935
00:54:56.685 --> 00:54:59.254
Ji An, did you tell them?

936
00:54:59.785 --> 00:55:01.424
To send you abroad?

937
00:55:01.584 --> 00:55:04.354
No, I've only been here a few days.

938
00:55:05.254 --> 00:55:08.225
I'll call again soon. I have to go downstairs.

939
00:55:08.694 --> 00:55:10.424
Okay, bye.

940
00:55:18.334 --> 00:55:20.035
I have a delivery.

941
00:55:21.205 --> 00:55:23.345
Here. It's what you ordered yesterday.

942
00:55:23.345 --> 00:55:25.174
It's 1 of each of the 4 flavors.

943
00:55:26.115 --> 00:55:27.884
I didn't order that many.

944
00:55:27.884 --> 00:55:29.015
Thanks for coming by.

945
00:55:29.015 --> 00:55:30.544
Don't worry.

946
00:55:30.544 --> 00:55:33.185
I like being able to get out and exercise.

947
00:55:33.415 --> 00:55:35.984
It can get stuffy being indoors all day.

948
00:55:36.354 --> 00:55:39.654
Don't ever think of coming by.

949
00:55:39.654 --> 00:55:41.125
Call me at any time.

950
00:55:41.924 --> 00:55:43.125
Thank you.

951
00:55:46.495 --> 00:55:49.634
He has to come by often because of the furniture.

952
00:55:50.705 --> 00:55:52.774
Does he have a regular schedule?

953
00:56:05.415 --> 00:56:08.384
(There's money in the bag. Accept it and be happy.)

954
00:56:09.955 --> 00:56:11.924
There's no reply from Ji An.

955
00:56:22.305 --> 00:56:23.904
Hello, I'm Seo...

956
00:56:24.334 --> 00:56:26.774
I'm Choi Eun Seok.

957
00:56:27.475 --> 00:56:30.875
Hello. You can call me Ms. Yang.

958
00:56:30.975 --> 00:56:32.814
Okay, then, Ms. Yang.

959
00:56:32.814 --> 00:56:35.115
Would you like to sit here?

960
00:56:40.415 --> 00:56:42.984
Okay... Then, Ms. Min.

961
00:56:42.984 --> 00:56:44.895
Could we have some tea?

962
00:56:45.024 --> 00:56:47.125
Tea and snacks are on the dinner table.

963
00:56:47.365 --> 00:56:48.765
Oh, really?

964
00:56:48.765 --> 00:56:52.495
Ms. Yang, would you like to have some tea?

965
00:56:52.734 --> 00:56:55.165
Could you please sit down first?

966
00:56:55.604 --> 00:56:56.765
Sure.

967
00:56:59.774 --> 00:57:02.575
I was told everything about you.

968
00:57:02.575 --> 00:57:04.015
You can speak freely.

969
00:57:04.515 --> 00:57:05.575
Okay.

970
00:57:05.575 --> 00:57:08.845
You don't have to stand and bow deeply to me.

971
00:57:08.845 --> 00:57:11.615
I'm an employee who is being paid.

972
00:57:13.115 --> 00:57:15.785
But still, you're a guest...

973
00:57:15.785 --> 00:57:17.754
and my teacher, so...

974
00:57:17.754 --> 00:57:19.524
I'm not saying to not greet me.

975
00:57:19.524 --> 00:57:22.665
A glance and a slight nod will do.

976
00:57:22.665 --> 00:57:24.294
Oh, okay.

977
00:57:24.964 --> 00:57:26.595
Keep your back straight.

978
00:57:26.895 --> 00:57:29.404
Spread your shoulders and look slightly downward.

979
00:57:29.904 --> 00:57:31.774
Look straight into the other's eyes...

980
00:57:31.774 --> 00:57:33.504
and keep a relaxed expression.

981
00:57:34.375 --> 00:57:36.705
Instead of asking for one's opinion,

982
00:57:36.944 --> 00:57:40.415
take charge and say, "Let's have some tea."

983
00:57:42.984 --> 00:57:44.714
Haesung FNB...

984
00:57:44.754 --> 00:57:47.354
offers various sets for dating couples...

985
00:57:47.354 --> 00:57:50.955
as well as pizzas or pastas for families.

986
00:57:57.194 --> 00:57:58.634
(Sieve 200g of soft flour...)

987
00:58:02.935 --> 00:58:04.104
Mom.

988
00:58:04.274 --> 00:58:06.634
Why are you always out most of the day?

989
00:58:06.634 --> 00:58:08.875
- I had things to do. - Did you eat?

990
00:58:09.805 --> 00:58:11.845
- Yes. - You haven't.

991
00:58:11.845 --> 00:58:13.415
Your eyes are sunken in.

992
00:58:13.415 --> 00:58:15.714
- I'll set the table. - I'm not hungry.

993
00:58:16.714 --> 00:58:19.185
How about noodles with ripe kimchi?

994
00:58:19.185 --> 00:58:20.455
I can make it in 10 minutes.

995
00:58:20.455 --> 00:58:22.254
I said I'm not hungry!

996
00:58:25.125 --> 00:58:27.395
Why do you keep offering when I said no?

997
00:58:27.395 --> 00:58:28.825
Why? Why?

998
00:58:30.125 --> 00:58:32.365
When did you ever cook for me?

999
00:58:33.435 --> 00:58:35.104
Don't act out of character.

1000
00:58:35.904 --> 00:58:38.104
Until now we had Ji An.

1001
00:58:40.504 --> 00:58:42.345
She used to do everything.

1002
00:58:43.145 --> 00:58:46.615
But now she's gone.

1003
00:58:48.084 --> 00:58:51.115
Now I'm your only daughter.

1004
00:58:51.714 --> 00:58:53.515
So I have to cook for you.

1005
00:58:54.754 --> 00:58:56.354
Don't you feel sorry for Ji Soo?

1006
00:58:57.895 --> 00:58:59.495
So you steal someone's dream?

1007
00:58:59.694 --> 00:59:01.225
That's theft.

1008
00:59:03.365 --> 00:59:05.665
What's wrong, Mom? Are you sick?

1009
00:59:08.064 --> 00:59:09.165
No.

1010
00:59:11.035 --> 00:59:12.134
I'm grateful.

1011
00:59:13.035 --> 00:59:14.104
And sorry.

1012
00:59:14.805 --> 00:59:16.575
But I really can't eat now.

1013
00:59:18.115 --> 00:59:21.015
I already chopped up the kimchi.

1014
00:59:22.245 --> 00:59:24.484
Let's make fried rice for breakfast tomorrow.

1015
00:59:25.254 --> 00:59:26.384
Okay.

1016
00:59:27.754 --> 00:59:28.854
Tomorrow, then.

1017
00:59:43.104 --> 00:59:45.274
Ji Soo, eat this.

1018
00:59:46.134 --> 00:59:47.404
What's this?

1019
00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:50.475
Something you can eat fast since you slept in.

1020
00:59:50.745 --> 00:59:52.345
What's the occasion?

1021
00:59:52.345 --> 00:59:54.185
You never let us eat bread at home.

1022
00:59:56.845 --> 00:59:57.915
It's so good.

1023
00:59:58.214 --> 00:59:59.955
Slow down or you'll get sick.

1024
01:00:00.254 --> 01:00:01.285
I'm late.

1025
01:00:05.725 --> 01:00:07.055
Why are you taking that?

1026
01:00:07.865 --> 01:00:09.125
To eat on the way.

1027
01:00:09.294 --> 01:00:10.794
See you later.

1028
01:00:15.504 --> 01:00:17.604
Why is she so sweet?

1029
01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:24.345
Oh, my phone.

1030
01:01:25.834 --> 01:01:27.305
To find her parents,

1031
01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:29.674
we need a photo of when we found her.

1032
01:01:39.185 --> 01:01:40.185
Good.

1033
01:01:45.325 --> 01:01:47.254
What a good girl.

1034
01:01:47.254 --> 01:01:48.495
You took such a pretty photograph.

1035
01:01:48.495 --> 01:01:51.435
Come to me, sweetie.

1036
01:01:58.504 --> 01:01:59.904
I'm sorry.

1037
01:02:02.604 --> 01:02:03.975
I'm sorry.

1038
01:02:04.444 --> 01:02:06.115
I'm sorry.

1039
01:02:10.214 --> 01:02:13.015
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1040
01:02:17.694 --> 01:02:20.024
She pretended to be okay.

1041
01:02:20.595 --> 01:02:22.665
She must be thinking about Ji An.

1042
01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:25.564
What a witch.

1043
01:02:28.904 --> 01:02:30.064
Mi Jung.

1044
01:02:32.774 --> 01:02:33.904
Hey.

1045
01:02:33.904 --> 01:02:34.904
What?

1046
01:02:37.245 --> 01:02:38.814
Were you crying?

1047
01:02:40.274 --> 01:02:42.745
Why are you crying while looking at a picture?

1048
01:02:43.515 --> 01:02:45.354
Are you crying because you miss Ji An?

1049
01:02:45.354 --> 01:02:46.584
Give it back.

1050
01:02:46.785 --> 01:02:48.185
Is this Ji An?

1051
01:02:48.725 --> 01:02:51.555
Why is she so red?

1052
01:02:51.924 --> 01:02:53.694
Did she have chickenpox?

1053
01:02:54.064 --> 01:02:57.024
Even though I rent your house for cheap price,

1054
01:02:57.024 --> 01:02:59.694
you still can't just walk in like this.

1055
01:02:59.694 --> 01:03:01.305
Look at you.

1056
01:03:01.305 --> 01:03:03.265
I know the password because...

1057
01:03:03.265 --> 01:03:06.174
I was helping you out when you had a myoma.

1058
01:03:07.745 --> 01:03:09.875
But still, it's...

1059
01:03:10.274 --> 01:03:11.645
What are you doing here by the way?

1060
01:03:12.615 --> 01:03:16.115
I told my husband Ji An's actually...

1061
01:03:16.115 --> 01:03:18.785
Haesung Corporation's daughter on the phone.

1062
01:03:18.785 --> 01:03:20.654
Then when he came,

1063
01:03:20.754 --> 01:03:22.584
he brought this picture with him.

1064
01:03:23.084 --> 01:03:24.995
This picture.

1065
01:03:30.964 --> 01:03:31.995
How...

1066
01:03:33.395 --> 01:03:34.634
How...

1067
01:03:35.535 --> 01:03:37.234
How does he have this?

1068
01:03:37.234 --> 01:03:39.904
It's from the twin's first birthday party.

1069
01:03:40.075 --> 01:03:42.645
My husband brought his camera with him.

1070
01:03:42.705 --> 01:03:44.075
That's when he took this.

1071
01:03:44.075 --> 01:03:46.115
He said it was in his stuff.

1072
01:03:46.875 --> 01:03:49.115
When was it?

1073
01:03:49.314 --> 01:03:52.455
When we looked at albums during your housewarming.

1074
01:03:52.785 --> 01:03:54.484
You said you lost all your albums when you went...

1075
01:03:54.484 --> 01:03:55.584
to Dubai.

1076
01:03:55.584 --> 01:03:57.654
I guess he remembered it.

1077
01:03:58.495 --> 01:04:01.225
He told me to give it to you, since you...

1078
01:04:01.225 --> 01:04:02.895
wouldn't have any pictures of the late Ji An.

1079
01:04:04.035 --> 01:04:07.634
But who's dead Ji An and who's Ji Soo...

1080
01:04:07.634 --> 01:04:09.104
in this picture?

1081
01:04:09.904 --> 01:04:11.575
I remember...

1082
01:04:11.875 --> 01:04:14.805
one held the stethoscope on her right hand,

1083
01:04:14.805 --> 01:04:16.245
and the other on her left hand,

1084
01:04:16.245 --> 01:04:18.615
and refused to let it go,

1085
01:04:19.475 --> 01:04:21.285
but I can't tell who's Ji Soo.

1086
01:04:22.444 --> 01:04:24.254
Who's left handed?

1087
01:04:24.254 --> 01:04:26.455
I have to leave now.

1088
01:04:26.455 --> 01:04:28.154
You should go.

1089
01:04:28.154 --> 01:04:30.325
Where are you going? It's only morning.

1090
01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.495
I have to go somewhere. Hurry up.

1091
01:04:32.495 --> 01:04:33.895
I'll talk to you later.

1092
01:04:33.895 --> 01:04:35.924
Fine. I'll leave.

1093
01:04:35.924 --> 01:04:37.194
Bye.

1094
01:05:02.685 --> 01:05:03.754
Mom.

1095
01:05:08.895 --> 01:05:09.964
You...

1096
01:05:10.895 --> 01:05:13.595
left earlier. How...

1097
01:05:14.265 --> 01:05:15.634
Why are you...

1098
01:05:16.964 --> 01:05:18.104
Mom.

1099
01:05:19.134 --> 01:05:21.345
Why did you call her Ji An?

1100
01:05:21.975 --> 01:05:23.075
This is me.

1101
01:05:28.099 --> 01:05:33.099
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1102
01:05:57.104 --> 01:05:59.714
(My Golden Life)

1103
01:06:00.345 --> 01:06:02.515
Are you crying? What's wrong?

1104
01:06:02.515 --> 01:06:05.285
I'm just so glad to see you.

1105
01:06:05.285 --> 01:06:06.515
Are we strangers?

1106
01:06:06.515 --> 01:06:09.024
Everyone's a stranger except for yourself.

1107
01:06:09.225 --> 01:06:12.294
Ji Soo. I'm so far away.

1108
01:06:12.294 --> 01:06:14.165
I think you have something to tell me.

1109
01:06:14.964 --> 01:06:15.964
Yes.

1110
01:06:15.964 --> 01:06:17.765
I may be Eun Seok in this house,

1111
01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:20.064
but I'm still Seo Ji An.

1112
01:06:20.064 --> 01:06:21.564
Clean up everything Eun Seok brought.

1113
01:06:21.564 --> 01:06:22.765
Don't even miss a thing.

1114
01:06:22.765 --> 01:06:24.604
She caused this.

1115
01:06:24.604 --> 01:06:26.205
You threw it out? How could you?

1116
01:06:26.205 --> 01:06:27.944
You didn't even tell me. It's my stuff.

1117
01:06:27.944 --> 01:06:29.475
I thought you were smart,

1118
01:06:29.475 --> 01:06:30.915
but I must've been wrong.

1119
01:06:30.915 --> 01:06:32.415
I'm sorry, Dad.
