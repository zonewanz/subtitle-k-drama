1
00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.762
So Won didn't go home last night,

2
00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.400
He's never done this before,
Why didn't he go home?

3
00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:20.337
Oh, my,

4
00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:23.173
I came to the wrong house,

5
00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:24.641
I'm sorry,

6
00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:28.545
Father, come in,

7
00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:35.452
Is this your house?

8
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.588
Who is this child?

9
00:00:39.022 --> 00:00:41.491
This child is your granddaughter,

10
00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:44.728
What?

11
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:56.606
Baby, don't cry,

12
00:00:56.673 --> 00:01:00.677
It breaks my heart when you cry,

13
00:01:01.078 --> 00:01:05.682
Wait, Your mother-in-law says
she will find out,

14
00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:07.684
I'm certain he's having an affair,

15
00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:10.554
That's why he was being
so good to me,

16
00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:13.390
They say your husband is having an
affair when he's good for no reason,

17
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.425
Be quiet,

18
00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:18.028
Be careful what you ask for,

19
00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:19.563
I'm serious,

20
00:01:19.563 --> 00:01:22.999
He sometimes turns his phone off
and completely disappears,

21
00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.335
He must have been in surgery,

22
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:26.803
I have proof that he's having
an affair,

23
00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:28.705
Here,

24
00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:33.443
What is this?

25
00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:35.645
They're both tickets for violating
traffic signals,

26
00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:37.447
What about them?

27
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:39.116
Look at the address,

28
00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:40.951
They're both in Jeongleung,

29
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:44.421
Why would he speed at night when
he has no relation there,

30
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.689
You're right,

31
00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:49.860
He has absolutely,,,

32
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.329
no ties with this neighborhood,

33
00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.831
I'm sure that he's keeping a second
home with another woman,

34
00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:58.468
That's why he had 2 speeding
tickets in 1 year,

35
00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:02.139
He must have speeded in order to see
that woman as fast as he can,

36
00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:05.942
You're making sense,

37
00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:09.946
Doctor Lee, your life
is in my hands today,

38
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.420
(Episode 10)

39
00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.626
Tell me, What is this nonsense?

40
00:02:23.093 --> 00:02:24.728
Han Gyul, go into the room,

41
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.371
Jung Su Mi,

42
00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:36.606
Do you remember her?

43
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:38.675
What about her?

44
00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:41.111
She's Han Gyul's mother,

45
00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:42.546
What?

46
00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:45.582
So? Did she appear with her?

47
00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.318
Does she insist
that she's your child?

48
00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.522
- That's not the case,
- I knew that,

49
00:02:52.622 --> 00:02:56.993
I had a bad feeling
from the moment I met her,

50
00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:00.830
She looked coy, and I knew
she was extraordinary,

51
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.768
You're so naive, she would've
tricked 10 of you,

52
00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:08.338
- Father,
- You shouldn't be tricked,

53
00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:10.207
It's all a fraud, Just stay
out of it,

54
00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:12.442
I'll meet her again,,,

55
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:15.545
- and make her stay away from you,
- Please listen to me,

56
00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:18.148
- It's not a fraud,
- How do you know that?

57
00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:21.651
She's in jail,
How could she fraud me?

58
00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:25.522
She's in Cheongju Penitentiary,

59
00:03:31.494 --> 00:03:32.862
Goodness,

60
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.769
He went to find So Won,
Why have I heard from him yet?

61
00:03:41.271 --> 00:03:45.041
Why did he get a room
without letting Yeon Ju know?

62
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:46.142
Goodness,

63
00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:50.447
Who is it?

64
00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:59.522
Why are you here?

65
00:03:59.623 --> 00:04:01.858
Where is So Won?

66
00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:03.994
He won't answer my calls,

67
00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:05.695
Really?

68
00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.067
Father went to meet him,
Let's wait for a while,

69
00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:12.202
What?

70
00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:16.539
Did you two already know about it?

71
00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.108
That he has a second home
with another woman?

72
00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:20.010
A second home?

73
00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:23.747
If you put it that way, I suppose
there's nothing I can say otherwise,

74
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.384
You're so shameless,

75
00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:31.054
I have a hot temper, so I don't know
what I'll do,

76
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:34.557
Tell us where he is right now,

77
00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:36.559
He's in Jeongleung, right?

78
00:04:36.993 --> 00:04:39.996
Did you know about that?

79
00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.634
Hey,

80
00:04:44.934 --> 00:04:48.071
Give me the address right now,
I can find it out easily,

81
00:04:48.138 --> 00:04:50.874
Tell me the address right now,

82
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:55.445
Please be generous and forgive him,

83
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.181
He didn't have any bad intentions,

84
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:01.051
He goes there sometimes
to refresh himself,

85
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.253
Why would he have to
refresh himself?

86
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.489
- He's married, he can't do that,
- That's enough,

87
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.994
I don't know what I'll do,

88
00:05:11.127 --> 00:05:13.697
Lead us right now,

89
00:05:13.763 --> 00:05:16.633
Someone might die today,

90
00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.307
Tell me the truth now,

91
00:05:24.507 --> 00:05:27.744
Su Mi told me that we broke up
because of you, Is that true?

92
00:05:28.311 --> 00:05:30.380
Did you meet her while I was
in the military?

93
00:05:31.815 --> 00:05:33.516
Yes, I met her,

94
00:05:34.317 --> 00:05:37.020
I didn't like
her from the beginning,

95
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.621
Did you put on a show?

96
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:40.190
You pretended to accept
our engagement,,,

97
00:05:40.323 --> 00:05:41.991
only to separate us behind my back!

98
00:05:42.058 --> 00:05:43.693
Did she say that?

99
00:05:43.993 --> 00:05:46.563
Did she say that you broke up
all because of me?

100
00:05:46.563 --> 00:05:48.264
I'm about to go crazy,

101
00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:51.701
Please tell me the truth now,

102
00:05:52.635 --> 00:05:55.271
She knew from the start,,,

103
00:05:56.306 --> 00:05:58.808
that I disapproved of your marriage,

104
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.245
What do you mean?

105
00:06:02.412 --> 00:06:04.581
After you went to the military,

106
00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:08.051
she visited me at my office,

107
00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:20.830
Is there something
you want to tell me?

108
00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:25.602
It's all okay, Please tell me
what's going on,

109
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:30.874
I knew it's rude of me to come
here, but I had no choice,

110
00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:34.744
This is too important of a matter
for me to handle on my own,

111
00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:39.182
But I couldn't tell this to So Won
as he's in the army now,

112
00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:42.552
You know how men can
cause a problem sometimes,

113
00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:44.487
What is this regarding?

114
00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:46.256
Well,,,

115
00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.325
It's all right, Tell me,

116
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:00.637
Please me upfront with me then,

117
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:04.808
Are you going to give your
blessing for our marriage?

118
00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:08.445
I believe I already answered
that question,

119
00:07:08.445 --> 00:07:10.113
I told you we'll think about,,,

120
00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:12.816
your marriage after he gets
discharged and gets a stable job,

121
00:07:12.816 --> 00:07:15.018
I don't need excuses,

122
00:07:15.452 --> 00:07:17.053
I'd like to know
your real intention,

123
00:07:19.322 --> 00:07:22.559
If I were to tell you the best
thing I did in my life is,

124
00:07:22.992 --> 00:07:26.062
it'd be that I brought So Won
into this world and raised him,

125
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:28.865
He's my precious son
and means the world to me,

126
00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.134
I can't let him marry just anyone,

127
00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:34.871
I assume that you meant me
when you said, "anyone",

128
00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:37.740
What is it that you want?

129
00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.079
I supported myself financially
since I was young,

130
00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:44.747
I'm mature for my age,

131
00:07:45.315 --> 00:07:46.816
So Won is a good son,

132
00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:48.952
I know too well that
you'll have your way,,,

133
00:07:48.952 --> 00:07:51.821
even if I beg So Won to marry me,

134
00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:53.189
So?

135
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:55.425
I want to break up with him,

136
00:07:56.626 --> 00:07:58.127
But there's a problem,

137
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:00.063
What is it?

138
00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:01.564
I need money,

139
00:08:01.998 --> 00:08:03.500
A lot of money,

140
00:08:06.936 --> 00:08:08.071
Look,

141
00:08:08.872 --> 00:08:09.939
Who do you think,,,

142
00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:13.009
I'm more than qualified
to ask you for that,

143
00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:15.078
You're ridiculous,

144
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:16.679
I cannot do that,

145
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.982
Haven't you figured it out?

146
00:08:19.482 --> 00:08:21.184
Don't you know
why I ordered juice,,,

147
00:08:22.018 --> 00:08:23.553
instead of coffee?

148
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.065
So,,,

149
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.269
you're saying that
Su Mi was pregnant,,,

150
00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:42.038
with Han Gyul at the time?

151
00:08:42.872 --> 00:08:44.040
There's no way,

152
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.409
She told me herself that
she wouldn't give birth to her,

153
00:08:46.409 --> 00:08:48.011
I gave her everything she asked for,

154
00:08:48.878 --> 00:08:50.346
Everything she asked for?

155
00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:53.116
Did you give her money?

156
00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:54.350
Yes,

157
00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:57.654
She said that she needed money
for her mom's liver transplant,

158
00:08:57.854 --> 00:09:00.123
I gave her a handsome
amount of money,

159
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:11.267
So it's impossible
that she's your kid,

160
00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:14.003
I bet that kid is someone else's,
and she's putting on an act,

161
00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:16.739
She would never do that,
She's nice,,,

162
00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:18.274
Then why would she be in prison?

163
00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:19.776
And whose fault is that?

164
00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:23.613
If you haven't separated us,

165
00:09:23.613 --> 00:09:25.615
Su Mi's life wouldn't have
been destroyed like that,

166
00:09:25.882 --> 00:09:27.750
You should've told me that you
didn't like her in the first place,

167
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.152
It was for your sake,

168
00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.021
I didn't want you to get hurt,

169
00:09:32.021 --> 00:09:33.890
I didn't want you to hate me,

170
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:34.991
Father!

171
00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.394
Hey, So Won,

172
00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.265
You only studied your entire life,
so you're not street-smart,

173
00:09:42.265 --> 00:09:45.335
I'll take care of everything,
so just stay out of this,

174
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:47.870
Don't put your foot in the gutter,

175
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.739
Focus on your family,

176
00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:52.976
Right now, your wife and
mother-in-law are in an uproar,

177
00:09:52.976 --> 00:09:55.612
Come on, Go home, Go now,

178
00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:01.084
- Yoo Ra, come, Hurry,
- I'm hurrying,

179
00:10:01.084 --> 00:10:02.385
- Is this the class?
- Oh, my,

180
00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:03.753
What should I do?

181
00:10:09.892 --> 00:10:11.594
It's all done, Do you like it?

182
00:10:11.594 --> 00:10:14.497
Amazing, It looks like I have
stars on my nails,

183
00:10:14.964 --> 00:10:16.833
- You're amazing,
- These are so cute,

184
00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:18.334
Hey, hey, Seo Eun Joo,

185
00:10:18.334 --> 00:10:20.203
It's my turn, Move,

186
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.871
What are you talking about?

187
00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:23.906
What? You got all
of your nails done,

188
00:10:23.906 --> 00:10:26.042
Do you only have fingernails?

189
00:10:26.743 --> 00:10:29.412
- Please do my toenails too,
- Oh, my, That's not right,

190
00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.114
Sure,

191
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.052
You know that toenails
cost twice as much,

192
00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.587
Don't worry,

193
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.757
Eun Byul, make yourself useful
and take photos for me,

194
00:10:41.257 --> 00:10:42.492
Okay,

195
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:47.997
- Hey, let me take one too,
- I want to take a photo too,

196
00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:52.702
You'd better move away from him,
You all look ridiculous,

197
00:10:52.702 --> 00:10:55.505
No, I'm a big fan of your brother,

198
00:10:55.505 --> 00:10:56.539
- So am I!
- Me too!

199
00:10:56.539 --> 00:10:58.241
- Come on, Take one already,
- Hurry and take a photo,

200
00:10:58.775 --> 00:11:00.743
In 1, 2, 3,

201
00:11:01.844 --> 00:11:03.746
Hey guys, pay me four dollars,

202
00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.015
Hey, you told me
it was three dollars,

203
00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:08.384
You have to pay an extra dollar
to even be in my brother's fan meet,

204
00:11:08.384 --> 00:11:10.653
- Seriously? No way
- Goodness, Unbelievable,

205
00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.722
- You're so cheap,
- What is this?

206
00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:28.004
Just give up,

207
00:11:28.004 --> 00:11:31.040
If you try to stay,
you'll experience the abyss,

208
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.776
Or is it the abyss already?

209
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:38.114
Fine, Let's see who's standing
at the end of this fight,

210
00:11:38.514 --> 00:11:40.116
It was so hard for me to get a job,

211
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.019
Even if I'm already in an abyss,

212
00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:44.787
I'll slug it out,

213
00:11:59.869 --> 00:12:01.337
Can you go outside?

214
00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.974
No, I cannot,

215
00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:07.410
I have to finish cleaning this
and do the dishes,

216
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.246
Think of me as a cleaning lady,

217
00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:12.381
Please go inside,
and take care of your business,

218
00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:19.856
It sounds like you're mad at me,

219
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.091
Did I upset you?

220
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:23.359
No, forget it,

221
00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:27.230
How can someone
who works in a warm hall,,,

222
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.766
understand the disappointment
of someone who works in the back?

223
00:12:29.766 --> 00:12:31.167
I'm all right,

224
00:12:34.737 --> 00:12:35.972
Hey, intern!

225
00:12:36.272 --> 00:12:38.508
Intern,

226
00:12:38.608 --> 00:12:40.510
Aren't you going to throw out
the trash in the kitchen?

227
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.346
Oh, the trash,
I'll throw it out now,

228
00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:46.482
Do I have to look for you?
I'm so busy right now,

229
00:12:47.383 --> 00:12:49.852
Hey, take Clorox bleach, Goodness,
That little,,,

230
00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:54.791
Hang in there, Ru Ri,

231
00:12:55.792 --> 00:12:57.527
Every cloud has a silver lining,

232
00:13:00.129 --> 00:13:02.865
Goodness, come, trash, Come,

233
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.869
This is so tiring,

234
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:08.037
Hold on,

235
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:10.273
What are you doing?

236
00:13:10.273 --> 00:13:13.876
The chef told me
to take out the trash,

237
00:13:26.989 --> 00:13:29.192
Can't you throw
out the trash properly?

238
00:13:29.525 --> 00:13:32.161
Is there anything
you can actually do?

239
00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:35.631
Don't you know that the fine
for mixing garbage and food waste,,,

240
00:13:35.631 --> 00:13:38.000
will be more than your
three months' salaries?

241
00:13:38.267 --> 00:13:40.703
Before I kick you out,
recycle the trash,

242
00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:42.004
Right now?

243
00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:43.873
Without gloves?

244
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:47.109
Yes, do it right now,

245
00:14:44.767 --> 00:14:47.270
I see wrinkles around her eyes,

246
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.572
but this is Anna, I'm sure of it,

247
00:14:50.106 --> 00:14:51.374
Anna Kang,

248
00:14:57.013 --> 00:14:59.515
Sir, this is what you asked for,

249
00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.487
This is the owner
of the Vehicle 9378,

250
00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:05.888
(Go Jung Do, 127 Myeonmok-ro,
Jungnang-gu, Seoul)

251
00:15:05.888 --> 00:15:07.757
Should I dig deeper about him?

252
00:15:07.757 --> 00:15:10.893
No, Time is pressing,
I must meet her in person,

253
00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:12.995
Yes, sir,

254
00:15:21.203 --> 00:15:23.005
This is the right address, sir,

255
00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:25.107
I see,

256
00:15:26.742 --> 00:15:28.344
Let me ask around,,,

257
00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.713
to see if the lady, Anna,
lives in that house,

258
00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:35.117
No, There's no need,

259
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.726
Don't say such a thing, honey,
Let's just go,

260
00:15:43.726 --> 00:15:45.995
I believe she's the lady you saw
in the basement parking lot,

261
00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:53.502
I take that the man next
to him is Go Jung Do?

262
00:15:56.772 --> 00:15:57.974
Follow them,

263
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:12.121
This crab pasta is a piece of art,

264
00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:14.123
- Isn't it?
- What's your secret?

265
00:16:14.857 --> 00:16:16.625
Do you know the taste of crab?

266
00:16:16.625 --> 00:16:18.494
Do you think you'll be able to
imitate if I teach you?

267
00:16:18.494 --> 00:16:20.629
You and I are on a different level,

268
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.733
I think this shrimp pilaf is better,

269
00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:26.969
Are you choking?

270
00:16:26.969 --> 00:16:29.372
What's wrong? Drink some water,

271
00:16:29.872 --> 00:16:31.007
Eat slowly,

272
00:16:31.374 --> 00:16:34.010
I'm done separating the garbage,

273
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.211
Okay,

274
00:16:35.878 --> 00:16:37.613
Although I'm not sure
if you did a good job,

275
00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.583
You should be hungry, Eat,

276
00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:42.752
I made the shrimp pilaf
that you like,

277
00:16:43.052 --> 00:16:44.754
Eat four full servings,

278
00:16:45.821 --> 00:16:48.991
Thank you, Manager, no Chef,

279
00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.368
People are happiest when they eat,

280
00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:08.911
What is this? They didn't leave
any left,

281
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:15.751
I should just eat instant noodles,

282
00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:30.433
I'm hungry, but I'll just eat
two today,

283
00:17:49.185 --> 00:17:51.320
Oh, my, What are you doing?

284
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:56.225
Do you have to give off cheap
smells at an Italian restaurant?

285
00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:57.693
Get rid of it,

286
00:17:58.294 --> 00:18:01.897
- They ate all of the food,
- You can eat it outside,

287
00:18:01.997 --> 00:18:04.166
Okay, I'll do that,

288
00:18:05.067 --> 00:18:06.402
I'll eat outside,

289
00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:17.179
Okay,

290
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.982
Why are you so slow?
Get out right now,

291
00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:23.719
It's so hot,

292
00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.988
You need cold water,

293
00:18:27.256 --> 00:18:28.457
It's so cold,

294
00:18:33.462 --> 00:18:34.530
Ru Ri,

295
00:18:38.968 --> 00:18:40.269
Are you okay?

296
00:18:45.007 --> 00:18:47.343
Stop exaggerating and clean this up,

297
00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:50.446
It's obvious that
you didn't get hurt,

298
00:18:52.248 --> 00:18:54.683
You're causing so much harm,

299
00:18:55.184 --> 00:18:58.254
0 points for dishwashing and
0 points for separating trash,

300
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.055
You even have a problem with safety,

301
00:19:00.856 --> 00:19:04.593
You're shameless to want to earn
money like this,

302
00:19:07.163 --> 00:19:09.498
Why? Do you have any complaints?

303
00:19:10.666 --> 00:19:11.934
Then quit,

304
00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:15.004
No one is going to stop you,

305
00:19:16.071 --> 00:19:17.173
Isn't that true?

306
00:19:33.222 --> 00:19:34.456
Go change your clothes,

307
00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:36.759
We need to start preparing
for dinner,

308
00:19:40.229 --> 00:19:41.297
Hurry,

309
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:05.521
It's just that I'm moved,

310
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.891
Everyone treated me as a loser,

311
00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:14.430
I'm so happy that I finally have
a position in this society,

312
00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:20.069
You're causing so much harm,

313
00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:22.104
Then quit,

314
00:20:22.571 --> 00:20:25.441
No one is going to stop you,

315
00:20:41.056 --> 00:20:42.258
There's no time to cry,

316
00:20:42.791 --> 00:20:44.059
Wash up, and come back,

317
00:20:46.061 --> 00:20:47.596
I'm not going back,

318
00:20:49.898 --> 00:20:54.503
I'm going to disappoint
people, give up,

319
00:20:56.272 --> 00:20:58.340
and live like a loser,
I think that suits me better,

320
00:20:59.642 --> 00:21:02.311
I really resent you,

321
00:21:02.978 --> 00:21:04.213
What do you mean?

322
00:21:04.413 --> 00:21:06.982
Why did you give me
unnecessary hope?

323
00:21:07.249 --> 00:21:09.051
You can do it, You have talent,

324
00:21:09.051 --> 00:21:10.486
You have an absolute taste,

325
00:21:10.586 --> 00:21:13.522
I now know
that everything was a lie,

326
00:21:14.056 --> 00:21:15.491
Do you really think so?

327
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:18.394
Yes, You just needed an assistant
to participate in the contest,

328
00:21:18.394 --> 00:21:21.830
That's why you flattered me,

329
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.767
I believed that,,,

330
00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:27.603
and you don't know
how hopeful I was,

331
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.539
You must have had fun watching me,

332
00:21:30.773 --> 00:21:32.474
a talentless loser,

333
00:21:32.474 --> 00:21:35.244
trying hard to climb upwards without
knowing her position,

334
00:21:35.944 --> 00:21:37.279
Was it fun watching me not know,,,

335
00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:40.849
that people were making fun of me
and trying my best?

336
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:45.187
I can't do this anymore,

337
00:21:46.021 --> 00:21:49.291
I'm so hurt and miserable, I'll just
go back to my old life,

338
00:21:49.925 --> 00:21:51.960
I'll go back to being a loser who
doesn't know how to do anything,,,

339
00:21:52.027 --> 00:21:55.264
and fails miserably at everything,

340
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:58.033
Is that as far as you can go?

341
00:21:59.601 --> 00:22:02.571
Will you quit your dream of being
a chef before you hold a knife,,,

342
00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:05.307
because you're defeated by chores?

343
00:22:06.775 --> 00:22:08.210
Yes,

344
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.545
Even though I'm angry,

345
00:22:09.545 --> 00:22:12.047
it's true that I don't know how
to do anything but cause harm,

346
00:22:12.047 --> 00:22:13.315
Just as Manager Joo said,

347
00:22:13.315 --> 00:22:15.217
You're only a beginner,
What do you expect?

348
00:22:18.554 --> 00:22:20.689
You'll give up easily the things
you acquired easily,

349
00:22:21.557 --> 00:22:23.559
Things that take effort will remain
for a long time,

350
00:22:24.993 --> 00:22:27.329
I pretended not to know
because of that,

351
00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:30.599
But you want to give up now?

352
00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:32.601
You want to go back to your life?

353
00:22:35.871 --> 00:22:39.441
Okay, If you thought the world was
easy like that,

354
00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:43.312
go back and marry an appropriate
person your father chooses,,,

355
00:22:43.545 --> 00:22:45.013
and live an ordinary life,

356
00:22:46.515 --> 00:22:50.719
I'll remember you as a loser instead
of Lee Ru Ri,

357
00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:18.280
What should I do?

358
00:23:19.782 --> 00:23:22.985
What do you want me to do?

359
00:23:36.532 --> 00:23:37.766
Han Gyul, let's go,

360
00:23:38.033 --> 00:23:39.268
Where?

361
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.504
My house,

362
00:23:44.706 --> 00:23:45.774
Let's go,

363
00:24:17.973 --> 00:24:21.009
Take a left turn there,

364
00:24:23.245 --> 00:24:25.814
It really was Jeongleung,

365
00:24:25.948 --> 00:24:29.551
I didn't believe it, but it's real,
How could he trick me like this?

366
00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:30.719
Be quiet,

367
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:34.223
You'll only embarrass yourself
if you keep talking about it,

368
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.095
Please excuse me,

369
00:24:42.698 --> 00:24:47.002
So Won we're going to your place
with your mother-in-law,

370
00:24:47.002 --> 00:24:50.239
Oh, my, We're trying to catch
him at the scene,

371
00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:51.974
Are you interrupting us?

372
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.809
That's not the case,

373
00:24:53.809 --> 00:24:56.245
What's not the case? It really is,

374
00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:58.747
- Stop lying,
- Excuse me,

375
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.649
I'll take this for now,

376
00:25:01.316 --> 00:25:04.753
I'm going to destroy So Won,

377
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.421
Mr, Kim, drive faster,

378
00:25:06.421 --> 00:25:07.489
Yes,

379
00:25:10.292 --> 00:25:13.495
Wear this and go to work first,

380
00:25:13.795 --> 00:25:17.733
Father, I'm too shocked,
I can't do surgery in this state,

381
00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:19.968
Even my hands are shaking,

382
00:25:20.502 --> 00:25:23.906
There's no need to be nervous,

383
00:25:24.072 --> 00:25:25.240
Don't you know me?

384
00:25:25.507 --> 00:25:28.777
I'll meet her
and put everything in order,

385
00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:30.779
Take your mind off this
and focus on your work,

386
00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:32.214
What about Han Gyul?

387
00:25:32.214 --> 00:25:35.217
What about her?
She's not your child,

388
00:25:35.217 --> 00:25:37.252
We're going to take her to her mom,

389
00:25:37.252 --> 00:25:38.654
What if she is my child?

390
00:25:38.654 --> 00:25:41.990
I'm telling you, There is no way,

391
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.460
I can assure you 100 percent,
You don't have to worry,

392
00:25:46.995 --> 00:25:49.831
Even if this was from your past,

393
00:25:49.932 --> 00:25:53.035
your mother-in-law will kill you
if she finds out about this,

394
00:25:53.402 --> 00:25:56.371
Oh, my, It's horrible to just think
about it,

395
00:26:01.476 --> 00:26:04.446
- Are you expecting someone?
- No,

396
00:26:04.446 --> 00:26:06.181
Open the door,

397
00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:08.517
I know you are in there,

398
00:26:08.517 --> 00:26:09.851
Open the door,

399
00:26:10.185 --> 00:26:12.521
I am angry, Open the door,

400
00:26:13.522 --> 00:26:16.525
- It's my mother-in-law,
- Speak of the devil,

401
00:26:16.525 --> 00:26:18.760
Wait, what should we do?

402
00:26:19.061 --> 00:26:20.495
How did she find out about
this place?

403
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.499
Wait, why are you going out
like that?

404
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:25.934
What do you think?

405
00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:28.203
I will have to reveal everything,

406
00:26:28.203 --> 00:26:29.738
Are you out of your mind?

407
00:26:29.771 --> 00:26:31.239
Just wait,

408
00:26:31.707 --> 00:26:33.408
Wait, Stay there,

409
00:26:35.944 --> 00:26:38.013
Hey, you, Come here,

410
00:26:39.748 --> 00:26:41.283
Come here quickly,

411
00:26:43.051 --> 00:26:44.152
Goodness,

412
00:26:44.319 --> 00:26:46.154
You are so much like your mother,

413
00:26:46.154 --> 00:26:47.923
Why don't you listen to me?

414
00:26:48.657 --> 00:26:50.392
Come here, Come here,

415
00:26:50.525 --> 00:26:51.660
Hey, is there a back gate
out of here?

416
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.662
- Let me go,
- Of course not,

417
00:26:53.662 --> 00:26:55.397
- Let me go,
- Gosh,

418
00:26:55.397 --> 00:26:57.566
You're too noisy, Be quiet,

419
00:26:57.733 --> 00:26:59.835
- Are there any windows?
- We're on the 15th floor,

420
00:26:59.835 --> 00:27:02.304
Let me go, Let me go,

421
00:27:02.304 --> 00:27:03.939
What,,, How,,,

422
00:27:03.939 --> 00:27:05.307
Hey,

423
00:27:05.307 --> 00:27:07.409
Do you really need to
make a fuss right now?

424
00:27:07.409 --> 00:27:09.044
- Be quiet,
- No, no,

425
00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:11.279
We need to give up, It's over,

426
00:27:11.313 --> 00:27:13.281
- Let me go,
- Wait, wait,

427
00:27:13.281 --> 00:27:15.550
There is a way out
of every situation,

428
00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:16.718
How can we do that?

429
00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:19.755
Please help me, Please help me,

430
00:27:19.755 --> 00:27:21.423
Gosh, be quiet,

431
00:27:21.423 --> 00:27:23.392
- Let me go,
- Please help me,

432
00:27:23.392 --> 00:27:25.794
- Let me go,
- Just once,

433
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:27.095
Dr, Lee,

434
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:29.331
I'm crazy,

435
00:27:29.331 --> 00:27:32.100
Honey, open the door,
Why won't you open the door?

436
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.502
I'm crazy too!

437
00:27:33.502 --> 00:27:35.904
- Yeon Ju,
- Open the door,

438
00:27:36.171 --> 00:27:37.939
Let's just wait for a while,

439
00:27:37.939 --> 00:27:39.708
He could be taking a shower,

440
00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:41.543
Why would he take a shower?

441
00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:44.513
What do you think?
It's probably what I think it is,

442
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.649
He's probably going to take a shower
so that he can get ready,

443
00:27:47.649 --> 00:27:50.419
I can't put up with this any longer,

444
00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:52.621
I saw a store that sells locks
downstairs,

445
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:55.424
Bring someone from the store,
I need to break this door,

446
00:27:55.424 --> 00:27:56.425
All right,

447
00:28:03.398 --> 00:28:04.566
Hello,

448
00:28:04.833 --> 00:28:06.001
Are you visiting this house?

449
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:09.204
Yes, I had an appointment
with So Won,

450
00:28:10.172 --> 00:28:11.239
Mom,

451
00:28:12.908 --> 00:28:14.142
What kind of an appointment?

452
00:28:14.142 --> 00:28:17.412
Twice a week, I help So Won
warm up a little,

453
00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:21.750
Mother, she just said she helps him
warm up,

454
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.219
What do you mean by that?

455
00:28:24.219 --> 00:28:26.221
Do you really not get
what that means?

456
00:28:26.221 --> 00:28:27.923
That's obvious,

457
00:28:27.923 --> 00:28:30.792
How long have come here
to warm him up?

458
00:28:32.194 --> 00:28:34.830
It's been three years now,

459
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.064
- Three years?
- Three years?

460
00:28:37.032 --> 00:28:39.301
Yeon Ju, call the ambulance,

461
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:41.737
I'm going to do something bad
and just go to prison,

462
00:28:46.007 --> 00:28:47.008
Hey!

463
00:28:47.042 --> 00:28:48.510
Oh, my gosh,

464
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.146
- How dare you?
- Darn it,

465
00:28:51.513 --> 00:28:54.516
How dare you ruin a family?

466
00:28:54.516 --> 00:28:56.785
How dare you ruin a decent family?

467
00:28:56.785 --> 00:28:57.953
That's right,

468
00:28:57.953 --> 00:29:00.789
You deserve this, You do,

469
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:01.857
How dare you?

470
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.526
- You ruined my family,
- Yeon Ju,

471
00:29:04.526 --> 00:29:06.461
- How dare you?
- You ruined my family,

472
00:29:09.431 --> 00:29:11.233
Oh, my, Mrs, Yang?

473
00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:14.002
- Die, Just die,
- Mrs, Yang, Mrs, Yang,

474
00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:16.438
- Just die, Who is it?
- Oh, my,

475
00:29:17.706 --> 00:29:18.974
Gosh, Mrs, Yang,

476
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:21.843
Mrs, Yang, what is,,,

477
00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:32.654
Ms, Oh,

478
00:29:32.654 --> 00:29:33.755
Ms, Oh?

479
00:29:35.157 --> 00:29:36.525
Ms, Oh?

480
00:29:36.525 --> 00:29:38.160
She's my yoga teacher,

481
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.262
She comes twice a week
to teach me yoga,

482
00:29:40.262 --> 00:29:41.263
What happened?

483
00:29:43.899 --> 00:29:46.101
Gosh, Ms, Oh,

484
00:29:46.501 --> 00:29:48.703
I had said, "Hello",

485
00:29:48.703 --> 00:29:51.506
"Why are you here?"

486
00:29:51.506 --> 00:29:55.010
You should have told me
that you are his yoga teacher,

487
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.946
If you had proven that to me,
it would have been okay,

488
00:29:57.946 --> 00:30:01.850
Why did you just stay still
when we hit you?

489
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.185
And, Ms, Oh,

490
00:30:03.752 --> 00:30:05.754
I can't survive in a prison,

491
00:30:05.754 --> 00:30:07.255
I'll pay you,

492
00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:12.227
All right,

493
00:30:22.771 --> 00:30:25.507
Gosh, it's such a relief
that it ended like this,

494
00:30:25.974 --> 00:30:28.310
You should scold So Won,,,

495
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.945
and tell him to sell this house,

496
00:30:30.045 --> 00:30:31.746
Do you realize it now?

497
00:30:31.847 --> 00:30:34.015
Your precious So Won,,,

498
00:30:34.015 --> 00:30:35.650
can cause trouble too,

499
00:30:36.218 --> 00:30:37.519
So,,,

500
00:30:38.153 --> 00:30:40.655
you should treat Ru Ri nicely
as well,

501
00:30:41.223 --> 00:30:42.991
She got employed
with such difficulty,

502
00:30:42.991 --> 00:30:45.093
You should encourage her
to work hard too,

503
00:30:46.962 --> 00:30:48.196
Are you listening to me?

504
00:30:48.196 --> 00:30:50.899
All right, I will do that,

505
00:30:51.833 --> 00:30:54.402
Shin Mo, do you mean it?

506
00:30:56.304 --> 00:30:58.340
What? What did you say?

507
00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.674
What is wrong with you?

508
00:31:00.342 --> 00:31:02.477
Why are you staring into the room?

509
00:31:02.477 --> 00:31:04.746
I'm not,

510
00:31:05.413 --> 00:31:07.782
What's going on?
Is something in the room?

511
00:31:07.782 --> 00:31:10.719
No, no, There's nothing there,

512
00:31:10.719 --> 00:31:11.953
There's nothing,

513
00:31:12.254 --> 00:31:14.456
You should go back home,

514
00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:15.957
This is strange,

515
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:19.761
Why are you suddenly so intent
on sending me out?

516
00:31:19.761 --> 00:31:22.430
Why do you think
I'm trying to make you leave?

517
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.066
You must have been surprised
since this morning,

518
00:31:25.066 --> 00:31:28.503
You should go home first
and take a rest,

519
00:31:30.438 --> 00:31:31.539
Go home,

520
00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.475
Go,

521
00:31:33.475 --> 00:31:34.643
How about you?

522
00:31:34.776 --> 00:31:38.346
If I go too, you won't get any rest
because you need to cook for me,

523
00:31:38.813 --> 00:31:40.916
You should go, Don't worry,

524
00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:41.950
All right,

525
00:31:42.651 --> 00:31:44.552
I'll go first, Come back later,

526
00:31:44.552 --> 00:31:46.321
All right, No, it's not this way,

527
00:31:46.321 --> 00:31:48.323
Why are you coming this way?
What are you looking at?

528
00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:50.692
- Shin Mo,
- It's that way, Let's go,

529
00:31:50.692 --> 00:31:53.261
Don't worry, Go home,

530
00:31:54.896 --> 00:31:56.331
- Shin Mo,
- Yes?

531
00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:02.737
Why is there baby shoes?
What are those?

532
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.444
It's mine,

533
00:32:11.746 --> 00:32:14.749
I,, I mean,,,

534
00:32:14.783 --> 00:32:17.419
I bought this as a present
for So Won's wife,

535
00:32:17.419 --> 00:32:19.454
But now that she isn't carrying
a baby, I'll give them to her later,

536
00:32:20.221 --> 00:32:23.325
Go home, Go home, Go,

537
00:32:24.225 --> 00:32:26.394
Go home and rest, You look tired,

538
00:32:26.394 --> 00:32:28.096
Go home and rest,

539
00:32:41.643 --> 00:32:44.012
Hey, why did you come outside?

540
00:32:44.012 --> 00:32:46.247
I told you to stay in the room,
Why did you come outside?

541
00:32:46.247 --> 00:32:47.282
I'm hungry,

542
00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:52.854
Gosh, you're driving me crazy,

543
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:57.726
I can't believe this,
He's concerned about me,

544
00:33:02.897 --> 00:33:07.102
I bought this as a present
for So Won's wife,

545
00:33:10.939 --> 00:33:13.475
It looked used,

546
00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:16.845
That's weird,

547
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.017
Dr, Lee, this is not a normal
Soy Sauce Marinated Crab,

548
00:33:22.017 --> 00:33:24.052
It's made out of a King Crab,

549
00:33:24.052 --> 00:33:28.023
You should have this with rice,

550
00:33:28.023 --> 00:33:31.826
You'd have starved since morning,
You must be hungry,

551
00:33:31.826 --> 00:33:32.994
Thank you,

552
00:33:33.762 --> 00:33:35.463
Here,

553
00:33:37.565 --> 00:33:40.935
I'm so sorry, honey,
You're not angry, right?

554
00:33:41.903 --> 00:33:44.973
Why should I be? It's all my fault,

555
00:33:45.573 --> 00:33:48.777
I fell asleep
while reading a thesis,

556
00:33:48.777 --> 00:33:50.311
I caused such a big fuss,

557
00:33:50.512 --> 00:33:53.581
I'm so sorry, Mother-in-law,

558
00:33:53.581 --> 00:33:57.185
No, no, It was all my mistake,

559
00:33:57.252 --> 00:34:00.355
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry,

560
00:34:01.222 --> 00:34:04.793
It must have been so hard
to live here with me,

561
00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:07.462
That's why you got a second house,

562
00:34:07.662 --> 00:34:08.830
Dr, Lee,

563
00:34:09.497 --> 00:34:12.801
I'll try to do my best,

564
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:14.936
So please don't keep any secrets,,,

565
00:34:14.936 --> 00:34:18.506
that might surprise us like that,

566
00:34:18.506 --> 00:34:20.275
I'm asking you nicely, Please,

567
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:25.580
I won't forgive you next time,
honey,

568
00:34:26.181 --> 00:34:27.582
Okay?

569
00:34:28.817 --> 00:34:30.185
- Eat up,
- Yes, ma'am,

570
00:34:39.794 --> 00:34:41.563
Okay, If you thought the world was
easy like that,

571
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:45.433
go back and marry an appropriate
person your father chooses,,,

572
00:34:45.834 --> 00:34:47.402
and live an ordinary life,

573
00:34:47.502 --> 00:34:49.270
I'll remember you as a loser,,,

574
00:34:49.771 --> 00:34:51.706
instead of Lee Ru Ri,

575
00:35:14.562 --> 00:35:15.763
Yes, Mom,

576
00:35:15.897 --> 00:35:18.666
Did I interrupt you at work?

577
00:35:18.766 --> 00:35:20.668
No, it's fine, What is it?

578
00:35:21.269 --> 00:35:23.771
Why's your voice like that?
Did you cry?

579
00:35:24.072 --> 00:35:25.773
No, I didn't,

580
00:35:26.441 --> 00:35:28.376
Oh, my, Maybe you're sick,

581
00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:30.478
It must be hard for you
to start working so suddenly,

582
00:35:31.012 --> 00:35:32.147
It is,

583
00:35:34.182 --> 00:35:35.316
That's why,,,

584
00:35:35.316 --> 00:35:38.186
Ru Ri, I have some good news,

585
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.624
Your father finally allowed you
to work at the company,

586
00:35:43.024 --> 00:35:46.227
He's not very certain,
so you should work hard,,,

587
00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:48.730
and prove to him
that you can do well too,

588
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.900
I'm so excited for you,

589
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.503
You must be busy,
You should go back to work,

590
00:35:55.503 --> 00:35:57.872
Cheer up, my daughter!

591
00:36:35.476 --> 00:36:38.813
I'm sorry for causing trouble,
Chefs,

592
00:36:38.913 --> 00:36:42.083
I'll work even harder,
so make me work even more,

593
00:36:42.183 --> 00:36:44.352
I beg you, I'm sorry,

594
00:36:45.253 --> 00:36:46.955
You're so shameless,

595
00:36:47.322 --> 00:36:49.290
- Wash the dishes,
- Yes,

596
00:36:53.027 --> 00:36:55.530
Hey, Intern, Garlic! Garlic!

597
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.631
Yes, Chef,

598
00:36:57.265 --> 00:36:58.666
- Hurry up,
- Yes,

599
00:37:01.436 --> 00:37:03.671
- Shrimp, please,
- Yes,

600
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.108
- Hurry up,
- Yes, Chef,

601
00:37:10.011 --> 00:37:12.647
Hey, Intern, Did you wipe the floor?

602
00:37:12.647 --> 00:37:14.082
I'll do that now,

603
00:37:14.082 --> 00:37:15.683
- Hurry up,
- Yes,

604
00:37:23.224 --> 00:37:24.959
- Wipe it clean,
- Yes,

605
00:37:24.959 --> 00:37:26.160
- Harder,
- Yes,

606
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.762
- Hey, here,
- Yes,

607
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.431
- It's done now,
- Okay,

608
00:37:37.705 --> 00:37:39.140
I beg you,

609
00:37:39.741 --> 00:37:42.377
Please don't hurt my family,

610
00:37:42.543 --> 00:37:45.780
Leave my wife and Tae Yang alone,

611
00:37:48.516 --> 00:37:49.817
How naive!

612
00:37:50.952 --> 00:37:52.854
No matter how much you beg,

613
00:37:53.354 --> 00:37:55.123
I'll end,,,

614
00:37:56.124 --> 00:37:58.293
Jung Tae Yang and your family,

615
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:10.772
Kim Jin Ho just called,

616
00:38:10.972 --> 00:38:12.240
He confirmed the money,

617
00:38:12.273 --> 00:38:14.275
So when's he coming?

618
00:38:14.275 --> 00:38:16.544
He wants to change
where we're meeting,

619
00:38:16.811 --> 00:38:17.912
To where?

620
00:38:30.291 --> 00:38:31.859
What's he doing here?

621
00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:40.001
What are they doing?

622
00:38:41.336 --> 00:38:42.503
How was school?

623
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.973
They must have a daughter and a son,

624
00:38:46.774 --> 00:38:49.410
- They must be students,
- Yes,

625
00:38:49.911 --> 00:38:51.913
They look like an elementary student
and a high school student,

626
00:38:54.382 --> 00:38:57.685
Do they have more children?

627
00:38:58.353 --> 00:38:59.721
Do you want me to find out?

628
00:39:00.588 --> 00:39:03.358
No, I'll find out for myself,

629
00:39:08.763 --> 00:39:09.897
Follow them,

630
00:39:10.531 --> 00:39:13.401
Are you practicing judo hard,
Woo Joo?

631
00:39:14.335 --> 00:39:15.670
Of course!

632
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.606
Don't lie! Your coach called,

633
00:39:19.974 --> 00:39:22.610
Why did you skip the practice? Are
you giving up going to university?

634
00:39:24.145 --> 00:39:27.482
- Actually,,,
- He hurt his ankle,

635
00:39:28.683 --> 00:39:30.351
- What?
- What?

636
00:39:30.752 --> 00:39:31.919
Is that true?

637
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.522
You were fine a moment ago,

638
00:39:34.689 --> 00:39:37.392
Hey, get up and walk, Now!

639
00:39:37.392 --> 00:39:39.560
- Get up,
- I'm fine,

640
00:39:40.995 --> 00:39:42.764
My leg, it hurts,

641
00:39:47.201 --> 00:39:50.571
Why didn't you tell me?

642
00:39:51.606 --> 00:39:54.976
- Gosh, Let's go to hospital,
- Okay,

643
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:56.911
No, I'm getting better,

644
00:39:56.911 --> 00:39:59.147
Right, He had acupuncture treatment,
He'll be better in a few days,

645
00:39:59.147 --> 00:40:00.481
She's right,

646
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:03.684
You should be careful,

647
00:40:03.951 --> 00:40:07.188
Kids, Please don't make Mom worry,

648
00:40:07.188 --> 00:40:10.224
Who do I love the most in the world?

649
00:40:10.224 --> 00:40:11.526
- Ms, Jung Hwa Young,
- Ms, Jung Hwa Young,

650
00:40:11.793 --> 00:40:12.894
You know it,

651
00:40:14.796 --> 00:40:16.063
Jung Hwa Young,

652
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.932
She's not Anna Kang?

653
00:40:21.369 --> 00:40:22.470
Hold on,

654
00:40:26.374 --> 00:40:28.142
What's up? You're at work,

655
00:40:28.276 --> 00:40:30.511
He's here in the restaurant,

656
00:40:31.212 --> 00:40:32.313
Woo Joo's dad,

657
00:40:34.749 --> 00:40:35.850
With whom?

658
00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:37.518
Actually,,,

659
00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:45.026
Okay, I'll look into it,

660
00:40:52.066 --> 00:40:54.702
- What's wrong? Who called?
- It's nothing,

661
00:40:55.269 --> 00:40:57.505
Let's go, I have to go somewhere,

662
00:40:57.505 --> 00:40:59.273
I was having fun,

663
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.375
Let's eat out, It's been a while,

664
00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:02.910
You always want to have fun,

665
00:41:03.244 --> 00:41:04.512
Let's go, Hurry up,

666
00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:10.318
Let's go, Let's go, Let's go,

667
00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:45.853
Honey, What's wrong?

668
00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:48.122
Nothing,

669
00:41:48.122 --> 00:41:50.391
- Let's go,
- Okay,

670
00:41:53.027 --> 00:41:54.128
Get in,

671
00:41:54.462 --> 00:41:55.563
Get in,

672
00:42:28.329 --> 00:42:30.264
I'm full now,

673
00:42:31.332 --> 00:42:33.801
Since we're in a restaurant,

674
00:42:34.402 --> 00:42:35.970
let's have one more steak,

675
00:42:37.939 --> 00:42:40.141
You should pay me back
if you had enough,

676
00:42:40.141 --> 00:42:42.276
Tell me what you know,

677
00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:44.879
You're so cheap,

678
00:42:45.746 --> 00:42:48.950
Looking at the size here,
you probably made a lot of money,

679
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.451
I said tell me,

680
00:42:50.585 --> 00:42:53.521
What do you know about
Jung Hwa Young?

681
00:42:55.723 --> 00:42:56.891
Let me digest first,

682
00:43:02.129 --> 00:43:03.931
Are you a swindler,,,

683
00:43:03.931 --> 00:43:06.434
I'm good at gambling,

684
00:43:06.434 --> 00:43:09.370
I may gamble, but I don't swindle,

685
00:43:12.106 --> 00:43:13.240
(Yeon Mi Joo)

686
00:43:17.411 --> 00:43:18.746
(Yeon Mi Joo)

687
00:43:18.746 --> 00:43:19.914
Flamenco?

688
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:23.017
You know Latin dance,

689
00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:24.685
Like this,

690
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.455
Find a woman who does that dance,

691
00:43:27.588 --> 00:43:28.723
And?

692
00:43:32.026 --> 00:43:35.429
Ask her about Anna,
Then you'll find out,

693
00:43:35.796 --> 00:43:36.931
Anna?

694
00:43:43.771 --> 00:43:47.208
Finish the workbook
until I come back,

695
00:43:47.274 --> 00:43:48.376
I'm going to check,

696
00:43:57.852 --> 00:43:59.453
I'm so sick of studying,

697
00:43:59.453 --> 00:44:01.355
- Go in,
- Okay,

698
00:44:34.622 --> 00:44:36.023
- Ms, Jung Hwa Young,
- Ms, Jung Hwa Young,

699
00:44:36.023 --> 00:44:37.124
You know it,

700
00:44:56.544 --> 00:45:00.081
Sir, Is she Anna?

701
00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:01.682
I'm not sure,

702
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:03.851
She has a different name,

703
00:45:04.018 --> 00:45:06.721
Maybe she just look alike,

704
00:45:08.222 --> 00:45:10.091
She looks just like her though,

705
00:45:10.624 --> 00:45:13.294
Her height and the way she smiles,

706
00:45:13.894 --> 00:45:15.162
It's still the same,

707
00:45:16.163 --> 00:45:17.798
Maybe she changed her name,

708
00:45:22.603 --> 00:45:24.505
I'll check,

709
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.890
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
but I have a question,

710
00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:45.059
The man who was sitting here,,,

711
00:45:45.793 --> 00:45:47.361
The man in a suit?

712
00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:49.163
What about him?

713
00:45:49.296 --> 00:45:51.499
I just want to check
if he's someone I know,

714
00:45:51.499 --> 00:45:54.168
- Did he leave?
- Yes, He just left,

715
00:45:54.835 --> 00:45:56.003
Okay,

716
00:45:56.704 --> 00:46:01.041
Does he come here often?

717
00:46:01.642 --> 00:46:04.779
No, It was his first time,

718
00:46:05.579 --> 00:46:06.747
Thank you,

719
00:46:14.221 --> 00:46:16.724
What did she just ask?

720
00:46:17.091 --> 00:46:18.192
Pardon?

721
00:46:23.297 --> 00:46:24.331
(50 dollars)

722
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.701
You talked for a while,

723
00:46:28.102 --> 00:46:31.605
She asked about the man
who sat over there,

724
00:46:32.273 --> 00:46:34.375
She said she wants to confirm
if he's someone she knows,

725
00:46:43.584 --> 00:46:44.685
How did it go?

726
00:46:44.685 --> 00:46:47.021
I think she's Anna,

727
00:46:47.021 --> 00:46:48.622
She came back to the cafe,,,

728
00:46:48.722 --> 00:46:50.391
and asked about you,

729
00:46:50.624 --> 00:46:52.660
- Are you sure?
- Yes,

730
00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.563
She said she might know you,

731
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:17.751
(Yeon Mi Joo)

732
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:26.160
Ask the Latin dancer about Anna,

733
00:47:27.228 --> 00:47:28.295
Anna,

734
00:47:36.604 --> 00:47:38.272
I see you often,

735
00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:40.774
Why did you meet Kim Jin Ho?

736
00:47:42.243 --> 00:47:43.811
You're fast,

737
00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:45.679
I'm warning you,

738
00:47:46.146 --> 00:47:47.815
No matter how hard you try,

739
00:47:47.815 --> 00:47:50.584
you'll never find anything
about her,

740
00:47:50.684 --> 00:47:54.121
I'll guarantee
you won't find anything,

741
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:56.490
so mind your own business, Get it?

742
00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:58.192
Don't you want to know,,,

743
00:47:58.192 --> 00:48:00.160
the real side of the woman
you live with?

744
00:48:01.662 --> 00:48:04.565
2pm on Thursday,
Flamenco in Hongdae,

745
00:48:04.765 --> 00:48:07.768
I'll show you the truth about
that woman when you come,

746
00:48:08.435 --> 00:48:09.570
The truth?

747
00:48:10.204 --> 00:48:13.540
I'm telling you once more time
that it's useless, You'll see,

748
00:48:13.607 --> 00:48:15.209
Suit yourself,

749
00:48:15.409 --> 00:48:18.312
I'll tell the world anyway,

750
00:48:18.312 --> 00:48:20.314
You'll find out later,

751
00:48:20.748 --> 00:48:23.584
Really? Then do as you please,

752
00:48:24.184 --> 00:48:25.853
You won't find anything,

753
00:48:47.041 --> 00:48:49.710
Come to Flamenco in Hongdae
at 2pm on Thursday,

754
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.579
I'll show you what kind of woman
you're living with,

755
00:49:14.335 --> 00:49:16.870
Are you almost done? Everyone left,

756
00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:20.274
Go first, I have to finish this,

757
00:49:24.812 --> 00:49:26.814
That's not how you do it,
Give me the gloves,

758
00:49:35.022 --> 00:49:36.023
Oh, my,

759
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:39.059
Use your wrist, Wrist,

760
00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.561
My goodness,

761
00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:44.631
Try it,

762
00:49:45.165 --> 00:49:46.200
Wrist,

763
00:49:50.871 --> 00:49:52.639
Use my wrist,,,

764
00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:55.809
like this,

765
00:49:57.044 --> 00:49:58.379
Practice until you get it,

766
00:49:59.279 --> 00:50:02.449
Teach me how to peel potatoes,

767
00:50:02.816 --> 00:50:05.152
If not, I have to stay up all night,

768
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.589
Fine, Try it again,

769
00:50:12.393 --> 00:50:14.628
Like this,

770
00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:19.066
Here,

771
00:50:20.701 --> 00:50:22.102
Use your wrist,

772
00:50:24.972 --> 00:50:26.140
Use it,

773
00:50:31.812 --> 00:50:33.647
Wrist,,,

774
00:50:34.181 --> 00:50:36.550
- Do you have hand tremors?
- No,

775
00:50:53.434 --> 00:50:54.835
You don't know the basics,

776
00:50:56.503 --> 00:50:57.704
Basics?

777
00:51:24.064 --> 00:51:25.332
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

778
00:51:29.103 --> 00:51:30.204
Yesterday,

779
00:51:32.372 --> 00:51:35.776
No, it was the day before that,
I was so tired,

780
00:51:36.777 --> 00:51:38.545
The basic requirement of
being a chef is tidiness,

781
00:51:38.979 --> 00:51:40.647
I'll go first, Work hard,

782
00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:43.050
You should wash your hair today,

783
00:51:44.084 --> 00:51:45.853
All right, I'm sorry,

784
00:51:49.289 --> 00:51:50.390
That was so embarrassing,

785
00:51:54.061 --> 00:51:56.430
Why did he have to come so close?
Gosh,

786
00:52:04.471 --> 00:52:06.340
How old are your parents?

787
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.109
They are in their mid-50s,

788
00:52:11.645 --> 00:52:15.315
A lot of people today have
red ginseng to restore their energy,

789
00:52:15.682 --> 00:52:17.017
Really?

790
00:52:18.519 --> 00:52:20.087
They would like this,

791
00:52:20.454 --> 00:52:22.956
Thanks to this, I'll be loved
this Chuseok,

792
00:52:23.857 --> 00:52:24.992
I'll have this one,

793
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.701
(You should have this red ginseng
so that you can wash your hair,)

794
00:52:38.772 --> 00:52:41.275
You should have this red ginseng
so that you can wash your hair,

795
00:52:41.441 --> 00:52:42.776
And give the other one
to your mother,

796
00:52:43.043 --> 00:52:46.280
I want to thank her
for giving birth to you,

797
00:52:55.022 --> 00:52:58.458
Manager Jung, Manager Jung!

798
00:52:58.592 --> 00:53:02.062
I was so startled that I thought
my heart was going to stop,

799
00:53:02.629 --> 00:53:03.830
Do you like me that much?

800
00:53:04.798 --> 00:53:06.099
Don't go,

801
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.704
I'll name you my favorite assistant,

802
00:53:21.982 --> 00:53:26.019
Honey, can you make some time for me
this afternoon?

803
00:53:26.453 --> 00:53:29.990
The obstetrician told me
to bring you with me,

804
00:53:31.024 --> 00:53:32.893
Yeon Ju, I told you,

805
00:53:32.893 --> 00:53:34.294
We don't need to hurry,

806
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:38.532
Why are you so negative?

807
00:53:38.532 --> 00:53:41.201
The reason why you are concerned
about other things,,,

808
00:53:41.201 --> 00:53:44.004
and have another house,,,

809
00:53:44.204 --> 00:53:47.341
is because you don't have a baby
with Yeon Ju,

810
00:53:47.374 --> 00:53:52.379
So every night, you need to try
to make a baby,

811
00:53:52.579 --> 00:53:53.680
If a baby,,,

812
00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:00.954
cries the house every day,
it would seem so much more alive,

813
00:54:01.255 --> 00:54:02.889
Eat up,

814
00:54:16.003 --> 00:54:17.604
Who are you visiting?

815
00:54:19.973 --> 00:54:21.241
Victory,

816
00:54:21.241 --> 00:54:25.112
I'm here to visit Room 705,

817
00:54:25.679 --> 00:54:27.080
Victory,

818
00:54:28.582 --> 00:54:29.750
Goodbye,

819
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.855
Victory,

820
00:54:35.022 --> 00:54:39.293
I'm here to say goodbye to
Ru Ri and her mother,

821
00:54:41.228 --> 00:54:43.563
Goodbye? Are you going somewhere?

822
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:45.332
Yes, what are you wearing?

823
00:54:45.332 --> 00:54:47.067
People might think
you're going to the army,

824
00:54:47.301 --> 00:54:49.269
You're right, I am,

825
00:54:49.269 --> 00:54:50.604
- What?
- What?

826
00:54:51.104 --> 00:54:53.473
You're going to the army?

827
00:54:53.473 --> 00:54:56.009
I only realized after
failing all interviews,,,

828
00:54:56.143 --> 00:54:58.312
and breaking up with Oh Mok Sin,,,

829
00:54:58.545 --> 00:55:02.082
that there is no man or company
in Korea that can accept my face,

830
00:55:02.582 --> 00:55:06.019
That's why I decided to
devote myself to this nation,

831
00:55:07.954 --> 00:55:10.290
Did the army accept you?

832
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:12.025
I will take a test,

833
00:55:12.025 --> 00:55:13.293
There's a test I need to pass first,

834
00:55:14.528 --> 00:55:16.897
By the way, where is Father?

835
00:55:16.897 --> 00:55:19.499
He didn't come home yesterday,

836
00:55:20.334 --> 00:55:22.002
Where did he go?

837
00:55:22.769 --> 00:55:23.870
Well,

838
00:55:24.471 --> 00:55:28.275
he slept at So Won's apartment
so that Mom could take a rest,

839
00:55:29.209 --> 00:55:32.179
Gosh, thanks to Oh Mok Sin, your
father has become a changed man,

840
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.314
What's this?

841
00:55:34.314 --> 00:55:37.584
Mom, this is a present,

842
00:55:38.952 --> 00:55:43.023
Manager Jung wanted to thank you
for giving birth to me,

843
00:55:43.623 --> 00:55:45.859
You should drink this first,

844
00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.829
You need to think about your health,

845
00:55:53.834 --> 00:55:55.102
Please thank him for me,

846
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:04.044
I should share this
with your father,

847
00:56:04.978 --> 00:56:07.647
Mother, are you really the one who
wanted a marriage graduation?

848
00:56:09.316 --> 00:56:12.219
Ru Ri's dad has been acting
very nice these days,

849
00:56:20.394 --> 00:56:23.430
Her number is 601,
and her name is Jung Su Mi,

850
00:56:29.202 --> 00:56:31.338
- What is it?
- I'm hungry,

851
00:56:32.272 --> 00:56:34.541
We can't buy anything here,
You need to wait,

852
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:36.276
I'm hungry,

853
00:56:44.017 --> 00:56:47.754
Nothing's worse than
watching someone else eat,

854
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:57.898
My goodness,

855
00:57:05.372 --> 00:57:07.340
Excuse me,

856
00:57:07.774 --> 00:57:10.911
but can you give some bread
for the child to eat,

857
00:57:13.914 --> 00:57:15.015
Yes,

858
00:57:16.416 --> 00:57:17.517
Thank you,

859
00:57:18.018 --> 00:57:19.119
Let's go,

860
00:57:24.691 --> 00:57:27.894
Here, Take this, and keep quiet,

861
00:57:38.338 --> 00:57:40.273
- What is it now?
- I'm thirsty,

862
00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:43.043
Goodness,

863
00:57:43.543 --> 00:57:47.681
What did I do to deserve this
at this age?

864
00:58:00.293 --> 00:58:01.394
Here,

865
00:58:07.267 --> 00:58:09.436
Visitors for prisoner 601?

866
00:58:09.436 --> 00:58:11.371
- Yes?
- Come here,

867
00:58:12.105 --> 00:58:16.142
You should stay here, all right?

868
00:58:16.409 --> 00:58:17.644
Where are you going?

869
00:58:18.812 --> 00:58:21.147
Your mother,,, I mean,,,

870
00:58:21.181 --> 00:58:24.684
You don't need to know that,
Just stay here,

871
00:58:27.854 --> 00:58:28.955
Excuse me,

872
00:58:29.723 --> 00:58:32.559
I need to go and visit someone,

873
00:58:32.726 --> 00:58:35.562
Can you look after her please?

874
00:58:36.062 --> 00:58:37.831
- Okay,
- Thank you,

875
00:58:40.567 --> 00:58:43.203
You look handsome,

876
00:58:43.503 --> 00:58:45.539
You'd be popular to girls,

877
00:58:46.473 --> 00:58:47.707
I am a girl,

878
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:52.279
I'm sorry that we had to meet again,

879
00:58:52.913 --> 00:58:54.180
What were you charged for?

880
00:58:55.682 --> 00:58:56.950
I'm an economic criminal,

881
00:58:58.051 --> 00:58:59.753
I've embezzled some money,

882
00:59:01.721 --> 00:59:03.356
You've ruined your life,

883
00:59:03.356 --> 00:59:05.859
Without Han Gyul,
it wouldn't have been like this,

884
00:59:05.892 --> 00:59:08.562
It wasn't easy
raising a child on my own,

885
00:59:14.401 --> 00:59:17.504
(Memorandum)

886
00:59:18.004 --> 00:59:19.706
Do you remember this?

887
00:59:23.476 --> 00:59:26.746
I, Jung Su Mi, vow that,,,

888
00:59:27.013 --> 00:59:29.249
I will never ask Lee So Won,,,

889
00:59:29.449 --> 00:59:32.619
to take any responsibility
for the child,

890
00:59:32.752 --> 00:59:33.954
Of course,

891
00:59:34.955 --> 00:59:38.024
I signed that memorandum
on the day of my mother's surgery,

892
00:59:39.392 --> 00:59:42.762
I made a vow to not give birth
to his child,

893
00:59:42.929 --> 00:59:45.932
Then what are you trying to do?

894
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.336
You made a promise,

895
00:59:49.336 --> 00:59:51.271
I was planning on raising her
by myself,

896
00:59:52.172 --> 00:59:56.409
I was so in love with So Won
that I wanted something of his,

897
00:59:56.643 --> 00:59:59.412
Do you want me to believe that?

898
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.750
I don't know
why you are doing this,,,

899
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:06.252
Even if you want to deny this,
she's your granddaughter,

900
01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:09.689
If you don't help raise her,
she'll go to the orphanage,

901
01:00:11.091 --> 01:00:12.726
Are you going to be
all right with that?

902
01:00:12.792 --> 01:00:14.294
Are you threatening me?

903
01:00:15.295 --> 01:00:16.796
No, I'm begging you,

904
01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:20.200
If I hadn't been locked up here,
I wouldn't have done this,

905
01:00:20.767 --> 01:00:22.936
If you can't believe this,
you should ask So Won,,,

906
01:00:23.603 --> 01:00:27.974
how Han Gyul ended up
in So Won's hospital,

907
01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.812
I know you planned this
with your sister,

908
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.184
I will hand her over to the police,

909
01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:40.620
Do you want So Won's career to end?

910
01:00:42.522 --> 01:00:44.724
The moment you hand her over
to the police,

911
01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:47.160
everyone in the world will know,,,

912
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.331
that the famous Dr, Lee
rejected his own child,

913
01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:53.700
What?

914
01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.268
How dare you?

915
01:00:55.268 --> 01:00:56.970
You should make them take DNA tests,

916
01:00:56.970 --> 01:00:58.505
You can check it out for yourself,

917
01:01:00.607 --> 01:01:01.641
All right then,

918
01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:04.310
Fine, I'll do that,

919
01:01:06.046 --> 01:01:08.081
so that you will never do this,

920
01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:09.416
Under one condition,

921
01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:12.218
Since you could trick it,

922
01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:14.721
do it in the hospital I know,

923
01:01:16.122 --> 01:01:17.357
Paternity test?

924
01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:20.126
Yes, That's the only way,,,

925
01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.896
to get out of this pit,

926
01:01:23.063 --> 01:01:24.764
I think she's my kid,

927
01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:26.599
That's why she's so confident,,,

928
01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:30.103
You don't know anything about her,

929
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.272
When she asked me for money,

930
01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.373
and this time again,

931
01:01:33.373 --> 01:01:35.542
She's also in prison
for embezzlement,

932
01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:37.811
She can do anything,

933
01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:39.679
I don't know what to do,

934
01:01:39.679 --> 01:01:41.381
Mother said it's because
I don't have a child,

935
01:01:41.381 --> 01:01:43.249
She urges me to have a child,

936
01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:45.418
What if she finds out?

937
01:01:45.418 --> 01:01:48.588
That's why we should have
paternity test,

938
01:01:49.489 --> 01:01:51.024
I'll handle it,

939
01:01:51.024 --> 01:01:52.892
You don't need to worry,

940
01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:57.764
What about Doctor Lee?

941
01:01:57.764 --> 01:02:00.300
He said he'll be here
for the appointment,

942
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.141
Mommy,

943
01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:12.479
I'll be a mother one day
if I try, right?

944
01:02:12.545 --> 01:02:14.414
Of course,

945
01:02:14.781 --> 01:02:17.016
Life is mean,

946
01:02:17.016 --> 01:02:21.087
Someone who wants a baby is sterile,

947
01:02:21.087 --> 01:02:23.623
but someone who doesn't want
a baby,,,

948
01:02:23.623 --> 01:02:25.525
gets pregnant so easily,

949
01:02:25.658 --> 01:02:27.293
My goodness,

950
01:02:28.361 --> 01:02:29.395
Oh, my,

951
01:02:29.929 --> 01:02:32.198
What's he doing here?

952
01:02:32.432 --> 01:02:33.800
Who?

953
01:02:35.902 --> 01:02:39.472
Maybe Father's here to cheer me up,

954
01:02:39.472 --> 01:02:40.473
- Father,
- Quiet,

955
01:02:40.473 --> 01:02:42.642
Be quiet, Wait,

956
01:02:48.948 --> 01:02:51.017
Who's that kid?

957
01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:54.420
I'd be a shaman if I know,

958
01:02:54.587 --> 01:02:55.922
I sense something,

959
01:02:55.922 --> 01:02:58.358
I sense a secret,

960
01:02:58.458 --> 01:02:59.659
Wait here,

961
01:02:59.726 --> 01:03:02.495
Mom, Wait for me,

962
01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:19.813
What do they do here?
What's this department?

963
01:03:19.813 --> 01:03:21.047
(DNA Laboratory)

964
01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:22.949
DNA lab?

965
01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:25.051
DNA,,,

966
01:03:25.318 --> 01:03:27.453
Paternity test,

967
01:03:27.754 --> 01:03:28.955
Paternity test?

968
01:03:28.955 --> 01:03:30.123
What?

969
01:03:30.723 --> 01:03:32.792
Oh, my goodness,

970
01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:33.793
Hold on,
