1
00:00:06.584 --> 00:00:09.315
We can stay here for now.
We will go inside later.

2
00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:10.515
(There are 12 cars in line
in this autumn night.)

3
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.079
We are supposed to wear
autumn outfits today.

4
00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:15.850
Yes. That's why I'm wearing this.

5
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.120
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hello.

6
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.020
There's no welcome scene.

7
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.219
There's no more.

8
00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.560
(They look stylish.)

9
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.560
We see each other very often
these days.

10
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.260
- Should I go?
- Eun Hyuk.

11
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.060
- Hello.
- I think I saw you recently.

12
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.900
- We are all dressed up for autumn.
- I know.

13
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.900
- Let's strike a pose.
- Okay.

14
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.339
(They pose for the camera
as they're dressed up for today.)

15
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.370
- Hi.
- Long time no see.

16
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.570
-Henry.
- Come here.

17
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.140
(And a new player arrives.)

18
00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:46.680
(Lee Elijah is
a young beautiful actress.)

19
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.250
(Hani is
charismatic and charming.)

20
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.320
Hi, Hani.

21
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.559
- Hi.
- Hello.

22
00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.559
Hello.

23
00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.029
- Gosh.
- Hi.

24
00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:00.159
There's another Player.

25
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.290
Hello.

26
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.830
I feel awkward.

27
00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.529
- Let's say hi together.
- Hello.

28
00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:08.339
(The oldest member of B1A4,
Sin Woo)

29
00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:10.200
- Hi.
- Did you get here now?

30
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.909
- Hello.
- Hi.

31
00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670
- Hi, P.O.
- What's going on?

32
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.009
I should go and say hi first
to other Players.

33
00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:16.480
You're here.

34
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.450
We can greet each other
later. Look for the keys first.

35
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.950
We have to look for the keys.

36
00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.179
- Hello.
- Let's do that first.

37
00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:23.480
- Find the keys first.
- Did he find something?

38
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.050
We shouldn't just walk.
We have to find the keys. Run.

39
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.590
- Let's go.
- We don't have time.

40
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.459
- We have to look for the keys.
- Oh, is this how it starts?

41
00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:30.190
- We have to find them
- Okay.

42
00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.560
- Do we have to find them now?
- Yes.

43
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.289
- Come this way.
- Find the keys.

44
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.759
- Hurry up.
- Do we have to look for the keys?

45
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.759
We have to be hurry. Find the keys.

46
00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.369
- What's going on?
- This way.

47
00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.700
It must be here somewhere.

48
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:43.269
- Gosh.
- What's going on?

49
00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.739
I can't find it anywhere.

50
00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:47.869
(Meanwhile)

51
00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:48.879
It's a helicam.

52
00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.050
(She's so relaxed.)

53
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.250
You have to find the key first.

54
00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.179
(Running)

55
00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.220
- Has it started already?
- Yes, it has.

56
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.289
Do I have to look for the key now?

57
00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.550
(She finally understands
what was going on.)

58
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.920
How do I find the key?

59
00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.090
Let's have a look.

60
00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.959
I should have put my running
shoes on.

61
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.300
Gosh. Su Geun. Give me one.

62
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.070
- No.
- How many keys did you find?

63
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.200
- Hello.
- Hani, I have something for you.

64
00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.439
What is this?

65
00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.739
(Is it the key?)

66
00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:23.880
Key is in my hand though.

67
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.410
Thank you. That's how it looks like.

68
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.119
- You know how it looks like.
- Yes.

69
00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:30.749
Good.

70
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.290
(Min Gyu found the key.)

71
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.820
I feel lucky today.

72
00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.730
(Elijah walks straight.)

73
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.200
Will you give me the key
if you find one?

74
00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:45.929
Hold on. No. Wait a second.

75
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.399
Okay. You can have it.

76
00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:50.100
You're very helpful.

77
00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.540
(Elijah found the key
with her quick move.)

78
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.540
You must be happy now.

79
00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:55.910
Yes, I am. Thanks to you.

80
00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.179
(P.O and CNU found the keys.)

81
00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.880
I'm so happy to find one.

82
00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.679
What is it?

83
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.749
I found it so quickly.

84
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.420
I can't really see at night.

85
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.989
I can't really see well.

86
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.660
Gosh. Where is it?

87
00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.100
My gosh.

88
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.170
(Every Player managed to
find the keys.)

89
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.540
I found it.

90
00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.010
- It was here.
- Okay. Let's go then.

91
00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.050
Who was the female player?
Elina?

92
00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:36.450
No. I think her name is Lee Elijah.

93
00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.249
- Lee Elijah?
- Okay.

94
00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.249
- Is she Korean?
- No, I don't think so.

95
00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:41.249
Hello.

96
00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:42.989
- Lee...
- Elijah.

97
00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.519
- Hi, Elijah.
- Hi.

98
00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.860
- You are Jong Min.
- Yes.

99
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.989
(Yes. I'm Jong Min.)

100
00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.029
- You are Lee Ye Jin?
- It's for the game.

101
00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.459
- Lee Elijah.
- Elijah.

102
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.700
- You're Elijah.
- Yes.

103
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.100
(It looks like...)

104
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.369
(they are on a blind date.)

105
00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.809
Today, we were asked...

106
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.369
- to wear autumn outfits.
- Yes, we were.

107
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.779
Let me have a look.

108
00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.110
- P.O.
- P.O and...

109
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.820
Min Gyu look both nice today.
Before we go inside,

110
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.219
let's vote for the most stylish
with autumn outfits.

111
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:15.219
You shouldn't dance.
He's showing off his moves.

112
00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:21.860
(He concentrates more
on his dance than his outfits.)

113
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.759
Go 1 by 1.

114
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.400
He is standing still.

115
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.670
I feel so jealous people
who can dance well.

116
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.770
- I feel as well.
- Look at his shoes.

117
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.710
- Hey, you're dusty.
- It's your turn now.

118
00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:37.879
- He's so tall.
- He looks great.

119
00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.650
He looks like an English gentleman.

120
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.720
- Min Gyu, you look great.
- He looks good.

121
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.350
- Great.
- He's stylish.

122
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.119
His legs are so long.

123
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.989
Everyone is so tall these days.

124
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.790
They are tall.

125
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.629
I wasn't the smallest
when I was younger.

126
00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:55.860
What are you talking about?

127
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.999
You were the smallest.

128
00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:58.869
Please do not put your heads
together.

129
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.639
- Please don't.
- They won't.

130
00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.970
(Please, no.)

131
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.840
My goodness.

132
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.670
(A disgusting forehead kiss)

133
00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:08.540
- Good.
- I was so surprised.

134
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.110
You guys are so outdated.

135
00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:12.650
- Let's go inside.
- Let's go.

136
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.809
- Okay.
- Let's go.

137
00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:15.949
We have to guess two people who
might have...

138
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.689
- the Master Keys.
- Find your places.

139
00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.790
(Players can find the real
Master Keys in here.)

140
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:23.619
- It's awesome.
- What is this room?

141
00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.860
This place looks great.

142
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.559
(Even when people are amazed...)

143
00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:30.559
I love this place.

144
00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.929
(Even when people are amazed,
they look for the Master Keys.)

145
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.639
This is fun.

146
00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.540
(Players have entered.)

147
00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:41.710
We all have 12 keys...

148
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.239
since there are 12 of us.

149
00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:45.679
There are only 2 Master Keys
among 12 keys.

150
00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.150
If we find two players
who have the Master Keys,

151
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.949
we will be the winner
of Master Village.

152
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.819
If one of the players who has the
Master Key finds the other player...

153
00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.020
with the Master Key without
getting caught,

154
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.929
they will both win.

155
00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:01.730
People who have the Master Keys...

156
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.600
have to be very careful.

157
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.730
First of all, you need to control
your face expressions very well.

158
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.929
- You were so bad last week.
- You were so bad.

159
00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:08.170
You were the worst player.

160
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.369
- I realized it later.
- It was his first time last week.

161
00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.309
You will see something
on the screen later.

162
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:13.509
It tells you whether your
keys are the Master Keys or not.

163
00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:14.670
It shows O or X.

164
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.379
Place your keys on the
Judgment Cabinet.

165
00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:20.910
Ask this question,
"Is this key the Master Key?"

166
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.119
You will find the answer
in the cabinet.

167
00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:24.280
It will answer with O or X.

168
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.920
They don't decide who is going
to be the owner of Master Key.

169
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.790
People who found the Master Keys
earlier...

170
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.660
- have the Master Keys now.
- As if it was your fate.

171
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.360
- The colors.
- Exactly.

172
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.730
CNU is already controlling
his facial expressions.

173
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.270
We will check the keys now.

174
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.069
Place your keys in the cabinet.

175
00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:44.569
Only two players will see
O on the screen.

176
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.470
"Is this key the Master Key?"

177
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.739
No, it isn't.

178
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.079
Don't get scared.
No one knows the answer yet.

179
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.520
You can't see it.

180
00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.689
I can't see well.

181
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.489
- Did you check it?
- Yes.

182
00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:02.520
Look at him.

183
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.590
He surely doesn't have
the Master Key.

184
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.790
You always have
the same look on your face.

185
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.730
I don't think he has the Master Key.

186
00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:09.900
He doesn't have it.

187
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.470
I look forward to having one
every week.

188
00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:14.530
- Hani, check your key.
- It's Hani's turn.

189
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.499
- I place my key in the cabinet.
- Yes.

190
00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:17.540
Ask the question.

191
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.970
Is this key the Master Key?

192
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.340
- P.O, don't look.
- Only Hani can check it.

193
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.550
- We can't see your face then.
- Show your face a little.

194
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.309
I can't see her face at all.

195
00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:29.819
- Show your face a little.
- You have to show your face.

196
00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:31.920
Okay, everyone.

197
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.590
Why are you guys so interested?

198
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.259
You have to show your face a little.

199
00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:37.360
- Okay.
- Just a little.

200
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.189
You don't need to show us
your whole face.

201
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:40.329
Look at her.

202
00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:42.129
- Show us your face a little.
- Gosh.

203
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:45.270
- Did you check?
- Look at her smiling.

204
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.530
She smiled a little.

205
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.900
- No. She didn't.
- She has the Master Key.

206
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.699
- No.
- I think she has one.

207
00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:52.470
- She doesn't have one.
- It's P.O's turn next.

208
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.210
P.O, get yourself ready.

209
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.579
P.O is similar to Eun Hyuk.

210
00:07:56.579 --> 00:07:57.840
He can't control his facial
expressions.

211
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.210
- P.O's ears are so red.
- No. I wasn't that bad last week.

212
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.949
- His hands are even shaking.
- No.

213
00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:03.749
- I think he has the Master Key.
- Ask the question.

214
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.850
Is this key the Master Key?

215
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.020
He's smiling already.

216
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.520
- Don't open it yet.
- Gosh.

217
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.460
Show us your face.

218
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.829
- He's saying "O".
- "O".

219
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.429
(He can't keep his neck still.)

220
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.600
- What was that?
- What is he doing?

221
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.100
- P.O.
- I think he got an X.

222
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.040
Are you nervous to be on a show?

223
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.840
No. I'm just shy.

224
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:30.110
- He's shy.
- Okay. I will check mine now.

225
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.949
We will know his result anyway.

226
00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:34.780
I've been practicing my facial
expressions.

227
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.379
Do it comfortably.

228
00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:38.079
We will still know his result.

229
00:08:38.079 --> 00:08:40.319
I think so too.
I could tell last week.

230
00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:43.020
I'm different from the last week.

231
00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.929
(What will his result be?)

232
00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:46.660
Is this key the Master Key?

233
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.829
- No.
- Wait.

234
00:08:49.199 --> 00:08:51.900
(He gets provoked so easily.)

235
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.400
(He eases his mind
and checks inside the cabinet.)

236
00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.270
He's trying so hard.

237
00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:02.740
He doesn't have one.

238
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.010
- He doesn't have it.
- He doesn't.

239
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.679
He doesn't have one.
He reacted differently last week.

240
00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.520
- He looks different today.
- He does.

241
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.520
It will be very hard to read CNU.

242
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.589
- We won't be able to read him.
- It will be hard.

243
00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:13.589
Gosh.

244
00:09:13.589 --> 00:09:16.490
Is this key the Master Key?

245
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.559
We won't be able to read his mind.

246
00:09:20.189 --> 00:09:22.059
He doesn't have
any facial expressions.

247
00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:23.599
He just made the sound.

248
00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:27.000
He must be good at controlling
his facial expressions or...

249
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.500
he just has no ideas.

250
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.839
Is this key the Master Key?

251
00:09:32.469 --> 00:09:33.540
Awesome.

252
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.179
- It's not showing yet.
- He reacted so quickly.

253
00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:38.040
- It's not on the screen yet.
- It is.

254
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.880
- It's not showing anything yet.
- Now he saw it.

255
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.479
I could tell this time.

256
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.490
- I'm so embarrassed.
- I could tell this time.

257
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.920
He's blushing

258
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.059
- What was your result?
- I'm sure he doesn't have the Key.

259
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.520
It's Elijah's turn.

260
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.689
- Is this key the Master Key?
- She might have the Master Key.

261
00:09:52.689 --> 00:09:54.490
She's an actress as well.

262
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.069
(Nodding)

263
00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:03.439
She's nodding because...

264
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.770
(Her facial expression is
hard to read.)

265
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.240
She's nodding.

266
00:10:10.479 --> 00:10:12.510
I don't know.

267
00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:15.949
Just check Chan Sung's ears
and you will know his result.

268
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.520
(His ears were red after
checking his result last week.)

269
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.490
Is this key the Master Key?

270
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.020
It's nerve-wracking.

271
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.020
"Yes."

272
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.020
Check his ears.

273
00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:26.790
- Check his ears.
- His ears are fine.

274
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.260
- Check his ears.
- I checked the result.

275
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.329
His ears are not blushing.

276
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.260
- He's not sweating either.
- He's not blushing.

277
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.500
He got an X this week.

278
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.000
It was hot last week that's why.

279
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.240
You got an X this week.

280
00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:36.740
I will check mine now.

281
00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:39.010
- Is this key...
- No. It's not.

282
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.439
- the Master Key?
- No. It's not.

283
00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:41.910
- No.
- "Master Key".

284
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.740
- Master Key.
- "Master Key".

285
00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:47.410
He looks like a detective.

286
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.949
Henry the detective.

287
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.120
He doesn't have the Master Key.

288
00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:52.189
- Okay.
- When are you going to...

289
00:10:52.189 --> 00:10:53.250
improve your acting skill?

290
00:10:54.859 --> 00:10:56.089
Poor Henry.

291
00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:59.189
We will be able to read
Min Gyu's mind since he's young.

292
00:11:00.589 --> 00:11:02.760
Is this key the Master Key?

293
00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.530
Check him carefully.

294
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:06.069
It's nerve-wracking, right?

295
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.069
He looks like as if he was
peeking at someone's house.

296
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:13.170
(His result is on.)

297
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.469
I'm done checking.

298
00:11:14.709 --> 00:11:15.780
He's cute.

299
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.449
Did you expect the result?

300
00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:19.510
Yes.

301
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:21.920
- It was result that I expected.
- Did you want an X?

302
00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.920
Is this key the Master Key?

303
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.719
Hong Gi isn't good
at hiding either.

304
00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:29.390
I hope he can understand
how I felt last week.

305
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.790
I hope he gets an O this week.

306
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.429
He opened it.

307
00:11:32.429 --> 00:11:33.459
He had the Master Key last week.

308
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.559
What?

309
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.130
It's an X.

310
00:11:36.599 --> 00:11:38.059
- Yes.
- Yes.

311
00:11:39.329 --> 00:11:42.599
His hands show that he's nervous.

312
00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:44.670
Don't think too much.

313
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.670
(He's casting a spell.)

314
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.510
(He's casting a spell.)

315
00:11:50.339 --> 00:11:52.510
It's an old skit.

316
00:11:52.849 --> 00:11:55.319
(Old skits are always funny.)

317
00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.920
- I think he has the Master Key.
- Is this key...

318
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.849
the Master Key?

319
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.160
Give me strength.

320
00:12:04.219 --> 00:12:06.790
Why? Why?

321
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.359
He's the worst comedian in acting
among the ones I know.

322
00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:11.929
- He's really bad.
- I realize that every week.

323
00:12:11.929 --> 00:12:14.329
- Let's move to the locker room.
- Let's go.

324
00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:16.370
We will get changed in
the locker room.

325
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.599
Do you have the Master Key?

326
00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:19.010
(Every Player moves
to the locker room.)

327
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.569
It's a weird color to wear.

328
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:22.640
- Gosh.
- I don't mind the color.

329
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.679
I think the staff members felt
sorry for me.

330
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:26.449
They gave me a waterproof jacket.

331
00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:27.780
They did.

332
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.319
(He got wet last week.)

333
00:12:29.319 --> 00:12:30.420
Hong Gi.

334
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.990
- I think they felt sorry for you.
- I felt sorry too.

335
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:34.490
They gave me a waterproof jacket.

336
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.790
- I think I will get wet again.
- You always get wet.

337
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.089
Of course.

338
00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:40.189
- Do we get changed now?
- Do we get changed here?

339
00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:41.459
Yes. We do.

340
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.959
Let's get changed.

341
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.500
I admit that I have the Master Key.

342
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.770
Okay. Whatever.

343
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.040
No one knows who have the Key.

344
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.910
- Yes.
- No one knows.

345
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.150
It's also hard to pick up
the Master key...

346
00:12:58.349 --> 00:13:00.550
- out of 12 keys.
- Yes.

347
00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:02.050
You can talk freely in here,
Min Gyu.

348
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.250
Do you have the Master Key?

349
00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:06.390
- Really?
- Yes, you can.

350
00:13:06.589 --> 00:13:08.620
The footage from this locker room...

351
00:13:08.719 --> 00:13:09.790
Just tell me then.

352
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.890
The footage from this room...

353
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.459
will be out after the show.

354
00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.530
Yes.

355
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.929
I saw the trailer of this show
before I came here.

356
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.270
- He isn't easy.
- I saw the trailer already.

357
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.500
CNU's ears are blushing only now.

358
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.599
No.

359
00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:25.670
CNU changed a lot.

360
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.870
(They are trying to find out.)

361
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.839
He became so bright all of a sudden.

362
00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:30.510
- I...
- He had a smile on his face.

363
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.380
I think this week...

364
00:13:32.609 --> 00:13:35.380
we should also be careful
of Jong Min.

365
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.819
He somehow looks so calm today.

366
00:13:37.819 --> 00:13:41.319
He becomes very calm
when he feels responsible.

367
00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:42.459
Look at him.

368
00:13:42.719 --> 00:13:45.189
- Is it you then?
- Is it you?

369
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:46.359
Jong Min's ears are blushing.

370
00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:48.760
He's not saying anything either.

371
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.030
It's a scary place here.

372
00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:55.370
(They start searching
for the Master Keys.)

373
00:13:58.969 --> 00:14:01.709
Each team should put all the keys
in each team's box.

374
00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:02.939
- Okay.
- Okay.

375
00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:06.280
- Hong Gi.
- Why are you struggling?

376
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.979
Is it hard to put it in
since it's the Master Key?

377
00:14:07.979 --> 00:14:10.349
- It doesn't fit.
- Gosh. Hong Gi.

378
00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:12.490
- It's okay.
- Gosh. Hong Gi.

379
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.819
Was the Master Key designed
differently than the others?

380
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.260
I can't put it in.

381
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.459
- He's funny.
- I can't put it in.

382
00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.699
He should get wet.

383
00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:25.069
We will check the Key Guide again.

384
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:26.929
- Yes.
- This is...

385
00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:31.099
A team that wins in a game can
choose one hint...

386
00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:32.670
from the Key Guide which can be used
for guessing the Master Key.

387
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.910
The hints are different
from the last week.

388
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.479
- All right, guys.
- It's different this week.

389
00:14:35.479 --> 00:14:37.880
"Five Players get picked randomly."

390
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.449
We can choose five Players.

391
00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:41.380
- It will be one-fifth of chance.
- That's right.

392
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.780
If I'm doubtful about Eun Hyuk,

393
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.650
then there would be four left
including Eun Hyuk.

394
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.420
- We can weed them out.
- Exactly.

395
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.319
- This one is the best hint.
- Which one?

396
00:14:49.319 --> 00:14:51.459
- We don't know it.
- I remember all of them.

397
00:14:51.459 --> 00:14:53.829
- Really?
- I remember all the places.

398
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:55.599
- I saw them all.
- Really?

399
00:14:55.599 --> 00:14:57.729
I know Eun Hyuk and yours.

400
00:14:57.729 --> 00:14:59.130
I don't have the Master Key.

401
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.370
- If they show us...
- Yes.

402
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.270
the places where
the Master Keys were,

403
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.910
we can try to recall who
picked their keys from those places.

404
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.540
Eun Hyuk, can you not understand
what it means?

405
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.579
I can.

406
00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:10.209
- I understand fully.
- If you don't,

407
00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:12.079
- just ask me.
- Ask him later.

408
00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.349
- You have to tell me.
- Okay.

409
00:15:13.349 --> 00:15:14.380
- Okay?
- Good.

410
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.849
I actually don't understand
one little thing.

411
00:15:15.849 --> 00:15:16.920
What is it?

412
00:15:17.219 --> 00:15:18.319
Why are they going to show us
the pictures?

413
00:15:18.319 --> 00:15:19.449
"Why are they going to show us
the pictures?"

414
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.089
Why do you think they filmed us
when we were looking for the keys?

415
00:15:22.219 --> 00:15:23.890
If you think carefully of...

416
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.189
the places that the Players
found their keys...

417
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:27.890
You didn't expect this kind of hint,
did you?

418
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.199
It shows that you were discharged
recently from the army.

419
00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:33.069
Do you understand?

420
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:35.199
(I need some more time.
Variety shows are hard.)

421
00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:39.209
All right.
This is the worst game of all.

422
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.170
It's even worse for me.

423
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.010
I can stand by this when I say it.

424
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.109
My band is more popular
overseas than in Korea.

425
00:15:45.109 --> 00:15:46.579
That's right.
Our fans all live abroad.

426
00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.620
- They are popular in Japan.
- Isn't Koyote famous overseas too?

427
00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:51.349
- What did you say?
- Isn't Koyote famous overseas?

428
00:15:51.349 --> 00:15:52.390
KYT.

429
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.620
- Koyote?
- Yes.

430
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.819
Shin Ji basically owns the group.

431
00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:00.030
(He's one honest guy. He's always
grateful to have her in the group.)

432
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.260
That is actually true.

433
00:16:01.329 --> 00:16:04.229
Please reveal the player
the Watchers supported the most.

434
00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:05.429
Goodness. I...

435
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.270
(The most popular player
the Watchers voted for is...)

436
00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:11.300
It's Min Gyu.

437
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.309
(Min Gyu)

438
00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.679
(Min Gyu is chosen!)

439
00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:17.640
I heard EBS, the three most popular
groups, owns the music scene.

440
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.280
They are Exo, BTS, and Seventeen.

441
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.410
(They are known
as the 3 popular boy groups)

442
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.550
- EBS?
- Good for him.

443
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.880
- Don't tell us what it is.
- Okay.

444
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.449
You can just use the Card
whenever you want.

445
00:16:24.449 --> 00:16:26.349
- Okay.
- It wasn't easy to read it.

446
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.819
He hasn't completely
understood the rules yet.

447
00:16:28.819 --> 00:16:30.559
- He chose it without hesitating.
- Make sure we can't see it.

448
00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:32.260
(This Chance Card will change
the course of the game.)

449
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.929
Min Gyu, I'll explain it to you.

450
00:16:34.329 --> 00:16:35.559
- How is the card?
- I can see that he's young.

451
00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:37.000
- It's great.
- Isn't it just amazing?

452
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.030
- Yes.
- Eun Hyuk...

453
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.370
- You're smart, aren't you?
- Let's start.

454
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.469
- All right. Let's do this.
- I think this is a good one.

455
00:16:41.469 --> 00:16:43.040
It's great
if you do well in any given game.

456
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.209
The most important part is
winning the group games.

457
00:16:46.209 --> 00:16:47.540
We are confident
about that, aren't we?

458
00:16:47.939 --> 00:16:49.579
Once we see it...
Wait, what is that car?

459
00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:51.650
- What is that car doing here?
- What is it?

460
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.010
I see. There's another one coming.

461
00:16:53.209 --> 00:16:54.579
I guess one player
from each team will go in.

462
00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:55.750
(Vans suddenly show up.)

463
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.020
Gosh, this is like a blockbuster.

464
00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.650
Gosh, these vans are coming in.

465
00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.150
Gosh, this is totally new.

466
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.160
What is this?
What are we supposed to do?

467
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.390
This is a game that we don't
get to play every day.

468
00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:06.589
This looks fun.

469
00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.000
You can see the vans are parked now.

470
00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:12.169
This is a game where we need to run
through the back seats in a relay.

471
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:14.200
- We have to open it and go in.
- We have to go into the car.

472
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.270
- We have to open it and get out.
- That's right.

473
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.300
Isn't this how we play this game?

474
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.909
Then will this be more advantageous
to players with small builds?

475
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:22.339
To whom were you addressing
so casually?

476
00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:23.440
Was that a question?

477
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.010
- Are you feeling nervous?
- I was talking to myself.

478
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.980
- Are you nervous now?
- You were talking to yourself.

479
00:17:27.149 --> 00:17:29.220
- Yes, I was.
- We must stand over here.

480
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.720
We should be ready over here,
and when we start the race,

481
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.720
- the next player can move up.
- Okay.

482
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.290
- Hong Gi, do you want to go first?
- I'll go against Henry.

483
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.460
Hong Gi and Henry will go first.

484
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.490
- Girls should go 3rd.
- Girls will go 3rd.

485
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.629
- I'll go second.
- Sure.

486
00:17:38.629 --> 00:17:39.960
- You can go 2nd.
- Great. Min Gyu will go 2nd.

487
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.829
- Then P.O ought to go against him.
- Min Gyu and P.O will compete.

488
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.030
Let's play it fair.

489
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.329
(They are all set
for the Van Relay Race.)

490
00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.399
Don't do anything weird.

491
00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:48.069
I'm sorry, but could you please
leave tissues inside the vans?

492
00:17:48.069 --> 00:17:49.540
I'm going to make Hyun Moo
get a nosebleed.

493
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.069
I'm serious.

494
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.569
I'm going to elbow him.

495
00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:55.540
I will make one
of your eyebrows go up.

496
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.540
I will punch you like this.

497
00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.540
- Get ready! Let's go!
- Wait.

498
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.879
- Be careful.
- Let's do this.

499
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.950
- Hey, push forward.
- Get ready.

500
00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.149
Get ready! Go for it!

501
00:18:02.379 --> 00:18:03.780
(Come on.)

502
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.720
- I got it. Okay.
- Let's have fair play.

503
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.520
Okay. Let's play it fair. Let's go.

504
00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:10.020
(The reason Henry
is especially energetic)

505
00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:11.859
(Last week, he lost a game.)

506
00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:14.030
(And...)

507
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.930
(he suffered the humiliation
of the finger flick.)

508
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.030
Let's play it again.

509
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.430
(He hasn't forgotten the indignity
he felt on that day.)

510
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.839
How could you hit him so hard?

511
00:18:21.839 --> 00:18:25.639
(This is a revenge match in which
the guys' pride is at stake.)

512
00:18:28.609 --> 00:18:29.780
(Hong Gi takes the lead.)

513
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.149
- Hong Gi is doing great.
- Nice!

514
00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:33.550
Hong Gi, you're doing well.

515
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.980
- Henry is grabbing Hong Gi.
- Get out!

516
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.419
- This is like a penalty.
- What are you doing?

517
00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:38.050
(Henry plays dirty
by removing the shoe.)

518
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.950
- He got rid of the shoe.
- What good will this do?

519
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.889
Who's next?

520
00:18:41.889 --> 00:18:43.059
- Who is next?
- You're doing good!

521
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.659
(However, Hong Gi runs well
even without one shoe.)

522
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.099
- Who's going next?
- Gosh, he plays dirty.

523
00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:51.569
(He runs so well to the point
Henry might be annoyed.)

524
00:18:51.569 --> 00:18:53.930
(Screaming in pain)

525
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.369
(He gets out of the struggle.)

526
00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:57.500
Hey, hey.

527
00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.770
- He can't do that.
- What just happened?

528
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.210
- Where are we starting?
- Play it fair.

529
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.270
(Team Su Geun is leading.)

530
00:19:02.139 --> 00:19:03.280
- Where are we starting?
- Play it fair.

531
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.309
- You can't cheat.
- It's right here, P.O.

532
00:19:05.409 --> 00:19:06.649
No, they're going to start here.

533
00:19:06.649 --> 00:19:09.879
Oh, my. We can only play
this game on this show.

534
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.119
Hey!

535
00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:13.149
- We don't have it.
- It's the same.

536
00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.260
Hey, just run for it.

537
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.159
(Henry hugs Hong Gi
as his last move.)

538
00:19:18.159 --> 00:19:20.190
- You can do it.
- P.O, run. Just run.

539
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.260
- No, he must come out first.
- He has to come down from the van.

540
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.329
Then you can pass the baton.

541
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.629
Both of his feet must
touch the ground.

542
00:19:24.629 --> 00:19:25.869
- Here he comes.
- Pass the baton.

543
00:19:25.869 --> 00:19:27.730
- His feet must touch the ground.
- Didn't we say they don't have to?

544
00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:28.899
Both of your feet must
touch the ground.

545
00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:29.970
(Hong Gi's feet haven't
touched the ground.)

546
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:30.970
Run.

547
00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.139
(Which player will come out first?)

548
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.639
Your feet must touch the ground.

549
00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:39.909
(Hong Gi's feet touch the ground.)

550
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:41.280
You're in the clear!

551
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.349
Hurry! Don't get caught.

552
00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:44.649
Move away from there.

553
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.149
Who's going next?

554
00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:48.619
- Hey, he grabbed my underwear.
- Nice.

555
00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:53.290
(Team Su Geun is still leading
with the second player.)

556
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.960
P.O. I'm sorry.

557
00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.669
(Another guy is hugging
during the game.)

558
00:19:59.669 --> 00:20:01.369
- My hands are tied.
- Okay, okay.

559
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.369
You can do it, Min Gyu.

560
00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:06.109
(Team Hyun Moo is catching up
as Min Gyu hugs P.O.)

561
00:20:06.109 --> 00:20:08.139
- Hey, hey.
- He caught up.

562
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.980
- I heard them breaking everything.
- He caught up.

563
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.040
(It sounds like
it's a close battle.)

564
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.250
Min Gyu caught up.

565
00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:14.409
He got P.O.

566
00:20:14.409 --> 00:20:15.480
(They arrive at the same time.)

567
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.649
He caught up.

568
00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:17.879
- Everyone.
- Hurry.

569
00:20:17.879 --> 00:20:19.250
- No.
- You must go now.

570
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.389
- It's dangerous.
- Let's go.

571
00:20:20.389 --> 00:20:22.159
- Hey, hurry. Run.
- Okay.

572
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.129
(The third match is
Hani versus Elijah.)

573
00:20:25.129 --> 00:20:26.230
- Are you okay?
- You did well.

574
00:20:26.589 --> 00:20:27.760
- Hey, hurry. Run.
- Okay.

575
00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:31.869
- Hani is doing great.
- Elijah.

576
00:20:31.869 --> 00:20:34.099
- Elijah.
- Hani got Elijah.

577
00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:35.139
(I should hug you too.)

578
00:20:35.139 --> 00:20:36.899
- Hani called Elijah.
- She called Elijah.

579
00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.740
- Whoever is next should move up.
- Elijah.

580
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.869
Elijah, Elijah.

581
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:41.980
(Elijah)

582
00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:44.680
- Don't. Hey.
- Elijah.

583
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.149
I can't do anything about this.

584
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:48.750
- You're going to get hurt.
- This is hard.

585
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.450
(The one in the front is
always opening the door.)

586
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.490
I'm opening all of the doors.

587
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.950
I look like a gatekeeper.

588
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.819
(Laughing)

589
00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:57.559
You can't chat over there.

590
00:20:58.089 --> 00:21:00.030
- She doesn't act like she's older.
- What should I do?

591
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.129
- Hold on.
- Let me open it.

592
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.899
I can't do anything because
I'm worried I might hurt you.

593
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.300
Goodness, Elijah.

594
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:08.740
Thank you.

595
00:21:10.899 --> 00:21:13.270
- Jong Min, get ready. You're next.
- I'm a gatekeeper.

596
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.280
(The third players
are full of love.)

597
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.609
It sounds like
they're dating each other.

598
00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:19.579
They look so happy over there.

599
00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:20.649
They got close.

600
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.250
(Hani begins to use her strength.)

601
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.520
Let's go together.

602
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.720
- It's my turn.
- Hold on. Her feet must...

603
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.889
Hold on. Her feet must touch
the ground when you start.

604
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.159
- Her feet must touch the ground.
- They must touch it.

605
00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:33.930
- That's it. Jong Min, go!
- Hey.

606
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:34.930
(Team Su Geun begins.)

607
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:40.200
(With Eun Hyuk's skill, Team
Hyun Moo manages to take the lead.)

608
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.230
Grab him.

609
00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:43.569
(Oh, no. Too bad that
the tables are turned.)

610
00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:45.569
Eun Hyuk, hold on. Wait.

611
00:21:45.569 --> 00:21:47.639
(I have no choice.)

612
00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:49.510
(He starts using dirty tricks.)

613
00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.139
Hey, my underwear.

614
00:21:51.139 --> 00:21:53.010
(He smacks Eun Hyuk's head and
pulls him by his underwear.)

615
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:55.050
- Eun Hyuk.
- My underwear.

616
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.379
(Eun Hyuk advances
overcoming the dirty tricks.)

617
00:21:56.379 --> 00:21:57.419
Eun Hyuk. Eun Hyuk.

618
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.250
(So this is how it's going to be.)

619
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.220
Jong Min. My sweater.

620
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.790
You're taking off my sweater. Stop.

621
00:22:05.329 --> 00:22:07.690
When Hyun Moo comes
out of the van,

622
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.500
I'll make sure you get
to see him naked.

623
00:22:11.329 --> 00:22:12.829
He will be completely bare.

624
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.970
I will let you even see
his body hair.

625
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.010
(Were you...)

626
00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:22.180
(referring to something like this?)

627
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.980
(It gets hectic as his upper
body is exposed.)

628
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.309
Hey, go!

629
00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.849
We could have lost.

630
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.849
(The race only left him wounded.)

631
00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:31.919
(Will that happen to me too?)

632
00:22:32.619 --> 00:22:33.750
He grabbed me.

633
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:34.750
(Feeling dizzy)

634
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:35.790
Are you all right?

635
00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:38.290
Great. We took the lead again!

636
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.990
(Meanwhile, Team Su Geun
takes the lead again.)

637
00:22:44.829 --> 00:22:46.770
(He can put up with the struggles.)

638
00:22:48.369 --> 00:22:50.270
(In no time,)

639
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.609
(the fifth players are
about to finish the race.)

640
00:22:52.609 --> 00:22:56.740
(The last race between the team
leaders are about to begin.)

641
00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.510
(The match where the hosts, Hyun
Moo and Su Geun's pride are stake.)

642
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.680
They didn't even arrive yet.

643
00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.190
- He looks really cool.
- That's not it.

644
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.250
(Chan Sung arrives first.)

645
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.990
- Su Geun is so fast.
- He's so quick.

646
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.260
- My goodness.
- Look at him.

647
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.319
I couldn't beat him.

648
00:23:11.319 --> 00:23:12.889
- Su Geun is amazingly fast.
- What is this?

649
00:23:12.889 --> 00:23:15.629
(Su Geun tries to widen the gap
as he is in the lead.)

650
00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:17.359
- He's amazing.
- He's so good.

651
00:23:19.369 --> 00:23:20.470
Are you serious?

652
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:21.700
What are you doing?

653
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.770
- That's not cool.
- Gosh, he plays really dirty.

654
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.270
He's going to rip it.

655
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.040
He really might tear
his clothes apart.

656
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.109
They're fighting.

657
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:28.879
(Is it really happening?)

658
00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:31.710
(Didn't I warn you or not?)

659
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.349
Hey, mister.

660
00:23:33.379 --> 00:23:34.409
(Su Geun, please don't do this.)

661
00:23:34.409 --> 00:23:35.819
- Hey.
- Stop it.

662
00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:37.149
Hey, you can't do that here.

663
00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:40.490
(Meanwhile, Su Geun dashes away.)

664
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.559
(I can't be the only one.)

665
00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:42.690
I saw that coming.

666
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.930
Why is your chest so hairy?

667
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:48.730
Those two are very friendly.

668
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.200
(Their dirty battle turns
into the battle of stamina.)

669
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.040
Su Geun, tire him out completely.

670
00:23:55.399 --> 00:23:57.169
Su Geun, you should tire him out.

671
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:58.240
(They walk through the fourth car.)

672
00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.309
This is the last one.

673
00:23:59.569 --> 00:24:01.139
Their shirts are completely ripped.

674
00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:02.210
- Hyun Moo.
- Su Geun.

675
00:24:02.379 --> 00:24:03.440
Who will win?

676
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.609
(Their battle gets fiercer.)

677
00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:05.950
Their shirts are completely ripped.

678
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.280
- Hyun Moo.
- Su Geun.

679
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.950
- All I hear is them panting.
- Hit Hyun Moo's temple.

680
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.819
- Hit his temple.
- In the back...

681
00:24:11.819 --> 00:24:14.589
- Su Geun, be determined.
- That was so not cool.

682
00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:17.359
(Both players have
given their best.)

683
00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:21.700
(What is the result of their battle
with all of their strength?)

684
00:24:25.129 --> 00:24:26.230
(Oh, my goodness!)

685
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.569
(Oh, my goodness!)

686
00:24:29.069 --> 00:24:31.669
(Team Su Geun wins the 1st round
thanks to Su Geun's effort.)

687
00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:34.210
Isn't he on my team?

688
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:37.409
(Contrary to his promise,
he is the one who came out naked.)

689
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.280
(I lost.)

690
00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.280
Isn't he on my team?

691
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:43.450
(Su Geun's strategy didn't
spare his body at all.)

692
00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:44.520
What is this?

693
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.649
Pass me the shirt quickly.

694
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.460
That was one dirty race.

695
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.720
But why are you so tanned?

696
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.629
- Why are you so tanned?
- Are you okay?

697
00:24:51.629 --> 00:24:53.659
I was so surprised.
Hyun Moo's chest was so hairy.

698
00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:55.760
Give me the cover.

699
00:24:55.829 --> 00:24:57.800
- But he was good.
- The race was cutthroat.

700
00:24:57.859 --> 00:24:58.930
Anyway...

701
00:24:59.069 --> 00:25:01.770
I thought they were filming
an outdoor clothing commercial.

702
00:25:02.139 --> 00:25:05.139
- It was hairy from here to here.
- It was a game.

703
00:25:05.869 --> 00:25:06.869
It was so shocking.

704
00:25:06.869 --> 00:25:08.639
He tried to grab it
thinking it was my hair.

705
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.379
I thought how he got his head there.

706
00:25:11.379 --> 00:25:12.450
That was gross.

707
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:13.909
His chest is so hairy.

708
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:15.480
Oh, my goodness. It is hairy.

709
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.119
- Why did you look?
- I was curious.

710
00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:18.720
(This is the last chance for Team
Hyun Moo to turn the table around.)

711
00:25:18.919 --> 00:25:20.520
- Go.
- That's great. She's fast.

712
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.720
Watch your hands.

713
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.359
- The doors are heavy.
- You lose your energy.

714
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.030
- Next.
- Jong Min.

715
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.690
(They will determine the winning
team by adding the records.)

716
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:27.829
The black van...

717
00:25:27.829 --> 00:25:29.260
Chan Sung is really fast!

718
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.000
- Goodness.
- He's passing through. Chan Sung!

719
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.200
(Chan Sung, the Flash)

720
00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.399
- Chan Sung!
- You can do it!

721
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:38.169
- We have a shot at winning.
- Gosh, you're fast.

722
00:25:38.569 --> 00:25:40.569
(Team Hyun Moo's race follows.)

723
00:25:40.569 --> 00:25:41.579
He's fast.

724
00:25:41.579 --> 00:25:42.680
- He's fast.
- Continue.

725
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.740
He's weak.

726
00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:44.809
Henry!

727
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:47.050
- That's great!
- All right.

728
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.020
The doors are heavy.

729
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.680
That's right.

730
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.149
Look at Hani.

731
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:53.589
(I will shorten our record!)

732
00:25:53.589 --> 00:25:55.319
- She's so strong.
- Look at her.

733
00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:56.389
What just happened?

734
00:25:57.059 --> 00:25:58.659
Goodness, who is she?

735
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.329
(Hani, the strong girl and the best
player of Team Hyun Moo)

736
00:26:01.829 --> 00:26:03.730
- Hey.
- I think we might've won.

737
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.470
Your record is
2 minutes and 4 seconds.

738
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.599
We won!

739
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.440
The ladies will break the ties.

740
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.809
- Ladies will determine the victory.
- It's an individual match.

741
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.109
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
for the inner course.

742
00:26:15.639 --> 00:26:17.379
- You should play it.
- It's ripped.

743
00:26:17.379 --> 00:26:18.950
- Can I just take it?
- That's right.

744
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.409
- You want to just take the course?
- What do you think?

745
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:23.349
Do they have to take
off their earrings?

746
00:26:23.419 --> 00:26:24.819
- Is it because you're older?
- No, no.

747
00:26:24.889 --> 00:26:26.619
- It's not that.
- Only they will play it.

748
00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:28.050
Get ready. Set.

749
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.020
(Elijah makes a false start.)

750
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.899
(I wanted to run
a bit earlier than her.)

751
00:26:34.899 --> 00:26:37.829
- Goodness.
- It's a game. Hani, go all out.

752
00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:39.829
- We have to win.
- Did you get that?

753
00:26:39.829 --> 00:26:43.399
(I think she really might go all out
if you tell her to do so.)

754
00:26:43.399 --> 00:26:45.109
(Hani is getting her energy.)

755
00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.139
(On this final race,
their pride is at stake.)

756
00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:49.780
- We have to win.
- What should I do?

757
00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.440
Go, go, go!

758
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.680
Go, go, go!

759
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.119
Hani, go! Hani, go!

760
00:26:56.119 --> 00:26:57.550
(Hani opens the door.)

761
00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.950
- Go!
- Go, Hani!

762
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.859
(She beats the advantage
by her speed and power.)

763
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.720
Hani, go! Hani, go!

764
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.290
(She moves to the second van.)

765
00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.089
- That's right. Use more force.
- You're doing great!

766
00:27:08.089 --> 00:27:10.599
(Hani uses more power.)

767
00:27:10.599 --> 00:27:12.530
You should block her!

768
00:27:13.129 --> 00:27:15.270
That's it. There you go!

769
00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:18.669
(It seems Hani might have the race
in the bag by the looks of it.)

770
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:22.440
(I will beat the advantage
you have with my power.)

771
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.809
- Hani should've gone against a guy.
- She's strong.

772
00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:25.909
- Indeed.
- That's right.

773
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.109
The way she got out
of the van was no joke.

774
00:27:28.109 --> 00:27:29.619
I want to go up against Hani.

775
00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:31.319
(Many of them won't be able
to beat Hani in the race.)

776
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.819
You just need to beat her
at the last van.

777
00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.889
(Only two vans are remaining.)

778
00:27:37.889 --> 00:27:38.990
I'm grabbing you.

779
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.030
(I can't lose out to you like this.)

780
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.629
(If you're going to hold onto me,
then I'll drag you with me.)

781
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.740
(Hani, Wonder Woman,
explodes with her power.)

782
00:27:52.169 --> 00:27:53.270
She's so dependable.

783
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.540
(The door of the last van opens.)

784
00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.879
Who is it?

785
00:27:57.879 --> 00:27:59.010
(The door of the last van opens.)

786
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.349
(Will Hani win as expected?)

787
00:28:03.079 --> 00:28:06.349
(Hani wins the final race!)

788
00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.460
(Since I won...)

789
00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.960
Gosh, she looks so chic.

790
00:28:12.589 --> 00:28:14.430
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

791
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:15.800
- She looks mad.
- Is that why?

792
00:28:16.129 --> 00:28:17.230
No, no.

793
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.230
- Gosh, Hani was...
- She was very good.

794
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.000
I don't know if she has the Key,
but she surely owned this game.

795
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.210
She was the Master Key of this game.

796
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.770
The best one is...

797
00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.909
- Let's hurry.
- But the thing is...

798
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:31.180
No, we should get this.

799
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.250
Right now, we don't know
any clues, but if we use this,

800
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.020
- we can narrow down to five people.
- They're talking about us.

801
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.950
- I can hear...
- We won't need to use it then.

802
00:28:39.089 --> 00:28:40.849
- I'm nervous.
- With this, we can find out...

803
00:28:40.849 --> 00:28:43.389
if 1 out of 2 has the Mastery Key or
not with a 20 percent probability.

804
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.990
- I think she's right.
- I agree.

805
00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:47.460
All right then. We will...

806
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.829
choose the one with picking
5 players of 1 holds the Key.

807
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.329
- Hani, you should say it.
- Okay.

808
00:28:54.869 --> 00:28:57.270
One of them has the Master Key.

809
00:28:57.639 --> 00:28:58.710
Open it.

810
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.809
(She asks the Question of Fate.)

811
00:29:00.609 --> 00:29:05.409
(Among 5 players shown on the
Judgement Cabinet, 1 has the Key.)

812
00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:08.720
(Which players will show up
on the Judgement Cabinet?)

813
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.520
(Jun Hyun Moo, Henry, Hani,
Kim Jong Min, and CNU)

814
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.250
- Okay.
- Whom are you looking at?

815
00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:16.260
Look.

816
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:17.919
- Okay.
- Whom are you looking at?

817
00:29:18.359 --> 00:29:20.960
- No way. It's driving me crazy.
- They don't look...

818
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:23.700
- Stop acting.
- This is fun.

819
00:29:23.899 --> 00:29:25.000
Seriously?

820
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.500
- Later on...
- How could...

821
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:27.970
This is unbelievable.

822
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.440
- We will explain it to you.
- This is so shocking.

823
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.440
- So the five of us are nominated?
- Everyone.

824
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.639
Are you getting ready
for the second game?

825
00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:36.339
- Are five players from their team?
- We were done.

826
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.250
- No, five from the whole cast.
- Let's get going.

827
00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.079
(Please understand the rules.)

828
00:29:40.079 --> 00:29:41.819
We should go this way. Let's go.

829
00:29:41.819 --> 00:29:42.950
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

830
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.149
It's a new rule.

831
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:45.490
(Which player has the Key?)

832
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.960
(High likely to hold the Key)

833
00:29:49.419 --> 00:29:50.819
(What is their second mission?)

834
00:29:50.819 --> 00:29:52.389
This is the second game.

835
00:29:52.629 --> 00:29:53.889
It's Timer Talk.

836
00:29:53.889 --> 00:29:56.599
(The 2nd mission is Timer Talk.)

837
00:29:57.659 --> 00:29:58.669
This sounds fun.

838
00:29:58.669 --> 00:30:01.030
You will ask the player
next to you a question...

839
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.740
as you hand over the cell phone.

840
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.970
When the alarm goes off, the player
with the cell phone is eliminated.

841
00:30:07.069 --> 00:30:08.240
In a nutshell,
the phone is like a bomb.

842
00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:12.680
We have to ask questions
within the time limit the crew...

843
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:13.849
has set.

844
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.750
The team of the last player
wins the game, right?

845
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:20.220
- The team of the last player wins.
- Exactly.

846
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.059
- Can we ask any questions?
- Of course.

847
00:30:23.059 --> 00:30:24.490
- Even uncomfortable ones?
- You don't need to hold back.

848
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.930
- I won't hold back anything.
- Remember it's a major TV station.

849
00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:29.500
- I'm going to do my best.
- Shall we start?

850
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.629
- We started.
- We used to do this in the 90s.

851
00:30:33.629 --> 00:30:35.200
- We started.
- Yes, I know that.

852
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.339
- I'll ask a question. Eun Hyuk.
- Yes?

853
00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:41.139
When was your last kiss
after you were discharged?

854
00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:42.780
- Did you start already?
- Yes.

855
00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.609
- You went too far. We just started.
- That's a hard one.

856
00:30:47.379 --> 00:30:49.619
- Don't think about it.
- When was the last kiss?

857
00:30:50.379 --> 00:30:52.220
- Answer it.
- The time is ticking.

858
00:30:52.319 --> 00:30:55.020
- It's been...
- Are you really going to answer?

859
00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.690
What are you talking about?

860
00:30:57.159 --> 00:31:00.089
- Why are you doing that?
- It was about 2 or 3 years ago.

861
00:31:00.089 --> 00:31:01.599
- It's been quite long.
- It's before your military service.

862
00:31:01.599 --> 00:31:03.930
- Ask the next question.
- I'll ask right away.

863
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.970
Ask.

864
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.030
Can I ask only the player
in the opposing team? Or can I...

865
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.000
- You can ask your teammates.
- Are you going to attack your team?

866
00:31:09.139 --> 00:31:10.899
(The time is up.)

867
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.710
(Eun Hyuk, flustered by the first
question, is eliminated.)

868
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.750
(I got him at my first try!)

869
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:21.210
- That was too quick.
- Your question was too difficult.

870
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.250
(The first question was
a bit too much.)

871
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:24.990
- Goodness.
- Who are they?

872
00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.050
(10 Punishers enter.)

873
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.690
- What's going on?
- What is it?

874
00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:33.260
- He's right there.
- He's the one.

875
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.159
(You should get your penalty.)

876
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.129
- Gosh, that was harsh.
- What just happened?

877
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.829
(Did they really smack
him with toy hammers?)

878
00:31:40.829 --> 00:31:44.069
Eun Hyuk revealed the answer
he didn't have to.

879
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.510
- What is this?
- I had no idea about this.

880
00:31:46.609 --> 00:31:47.740
- I didn't know.
- This...

881
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.409
- He thought too long.
- I mean...

882
00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:50.809
Why did you ask me such a question?

883
00:31:51.139 --> 00:31:52.950
I mean, seriously.

884
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.020
Can this air?

885
00:31:55.649 --> 00:31:58.319
- There are no practice rounds.
- Okay. It was a practice round.

886
00:31:58.319 --> 00:31:59.550
Okay.

887
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.790
I'm sorry, but could you
remove your chair?

888
00:32:02.089 --> 00:32:03.960
(I'm sorry. We are fully booked.)

889
00:32:04.059 --> 00:32:05.359
It was fun.

890
00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:06.559
Good job.

891
00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:08.859
Gosh, that was so mean.

892
00:32:08.859 --> 00:32:10.030
(Why did I answer that?)

893
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.030
(A harsh welcome-back
initiation of variety shows)

894
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.069
- Hong Gi should start.
- Hong GI can start us off.

895
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.700
- Shall I?
- Okay.

896
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.809
- That was the shortest.
- That was too harsh.

897
00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:23.339
- Hurry. You never know.
- I'm all right.

898
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.109
- Tell me the name...
- Whom are you asking?

899
00:32:26.309 --> 00:32:28.649
of the most recent movie you saw
with someone...

900
00:32:28.649 --> 00:32:31.119
of your opposite sex at the theater.

901
00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:32.720
Tell me when you saw it.

902
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.859
- This is an easy question.
- With someone of opposite gender.

903
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.819
- Of opposite gender.
- Tell me the recent movie you saw.

904
00:32:37.319 --> 00:32:38.889
I saw it with four days ago.

905
00:32:38.889 --> 00:32:41.329
- With whom?
- One with Ma Dong Seok.

906
00:32:41.329 --> 00:32:43.159
- It's "The Outlaws".
- "The Outlaws".

907
00:32:43.159 --> 00:32:45.300
- With whom did you watch it?
- It has to be a girl.

908
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.500
- You must tell the name.
- Tell us the name.

909
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.500
Why?

910
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.540
Goodness.

911
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.669
- You must say her name.
- Do we know the girl?

912
00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:56.210
- She was Korean American.
- What's her name?

913
00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.379
- Jessica.
- Tell us her name.

914
00:32:59.879 --> 00:33:01.879
- Jessica?
- No, not the singer!

915
00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:03.550
- No.
- Jessica?

916
00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.389
- You should ask a question.
- Ask a question.

917
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.089
Gosh, he's on my team.

918
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:09.520
- You should ask a question.
- Ask and pass it on.

919
00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:11.059
Do you like to drink?

920
00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:12.359
I'm a lightweight drinker.

921
00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:14.030
- Ask a question.
- That was nice.

922
00:33:14.059 --> 00:33:16.099
Ask anything. Ask Hyun Moo...

923
00:33:16.099 --> 00:33:18.059
if he's been seeing that lady.

924
00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:20.500
(Su Geun gives her a tip
about Hyun Moo's private life.)

925
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.540
- What are you doing?
- When was your last relationship?

926
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.669
- Ask everything including the kiss.
- When was your last relationship?

927
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:25.909
- Let's do this.
- When was it?

928
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:27.270
- When was...
- It was six months ago. Here.

929
00:33:27.569 --> 00:33:28.710
Six months ago?

930
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.139
- Stop lying.
- You didn't ask her a question.

931
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.879
- When was your last kiss?
- What a joker.

932
00:33:31.879 --> 00:33:34.680
My last kiss? I did it on a drama.

933
00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.180
- It was this year. When...
- Hurry and pass it to him.

934
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.290
(At last,)

935
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.589
(is it time for me
to answer the question?)

936
00:33:41.589 --> 00:33:43.220
When was your last kiss?

937
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.960
- It was six months ago.
- Stop lying.

938
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.829
- When was...
- I bet he's lying.

939
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.800
- When was...
- Ask her the question.

940
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.430
(He's jabbering at the last minute.)

941
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.069
(Hyun Moo is eliminated
as he looks back on his past.)

942
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.040
(Here comes the party
with toy hammers!)

943
00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.369
(Take my smack twice!)

944
00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:01.109
Who was that? Who was it?

945
00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:03.010
(I thought I was going to lose.)

946
00:34:03.139 --> 00:34:04.540
Can he lie that his last
relationship was six months ago?

947
00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.349
- What are you talking about?
- Stop lying.

948
00:34:06.349 --> 00:34:08.379
- What on earth are you saying?
- I know you're lying.

949
00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:10.950
How could you say it's six months
ago? She will be disappointed.

950
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:13.789
Even though I wanted to lie
about my last kiss,

951
00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:15.589
- Right.
- I couldn't help but be serious.

952
00:34:16.519 --> 00:34:18.019
It's because...

953
00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:22.030
Not being able to kiss
for a long time hurts my pride,

954
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.030
but admitting having kissed a girl
recently feels a bit weird.

955
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.930
- Then your kiss was recent.
- You kissed a girl recently.

956
00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:30.069
No, no. I was merely...

957
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:31.240
(I shouldn't talk a lot today.)

958
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.240
- Forget it.
- CNU should start.

959
00:34:33.339 --> 00:34:35.580
Ask difficult questions.
That's how you can stall time.

960
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.839
Only players from our team
were hit.

961
00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.780
(He has picked his first target.)

962
00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.479
Why are you staring at me?

963
00:34:43.519 --> 00:34:45.550
- Ask the question.
- Did we start?

964
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.149
- Do it.
- When was your last kiss?

965
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:48.390
- There you go.
- Seriously?

966
00:34:48.819 --> 00:34:51.060
- It was two days ago.
- You did it recently.

967
00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:53.490
- Come on. Don't lie.
- When my wife was...

968
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:55.100
It was like a soft peck.

969
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.930
- That doesn't count.
- He asked about the kiss.

970
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.999
- He asked about the kiss.
- I can't kiss anymore.

971
00:34:58.999 --> 00:35:01.300
When you are married, you can't
have passionate kisses.

972
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.839
I gently kiss her
as I leave the hose.

973
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.839
I kiss her when I get home.

974
00:35:05.839 --> 00:35:07.140
Do you kiss your wife?

975
00:35:07.769 --> 00:35:09.740
- No one kisses at home.
- Why wouldn't they?

976
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.050
It was hard for us to decide
to even agree upon gentle kisses.

977
00:35:12.149 --> 00:35:15.450
(Goodness, he can
be brutally honest.)

978
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.919
- He's the worst.
- Whom should I ask?

979
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.450
- He's going to ask you.
- Hani, you should try.

980
00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:20.019
When was your last relationship?

981
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:22.260
Every question is
about the last relationship.

982
00:35:22.359 --> 00:35:24.560
- It was about 2 years ago.
- 2 years ago?

983
00:35:24.859 --> 00:35:26.589
- Is that so?
- She looks so serious.

984
00:35:26.689 --> 00:35:28.200
Did you manage to poop?

985
00:35:28.399 --> 00:35:30.830
- Yes, I did.
- Poop?

986
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.499
- What does that mean?
- It means to poop.

987
00:35:33.499 --> 00:35:34.769
All right. Who is next?

988
00:35:35.439 --> 00:35:36.499
- It's our team.
- It's Min Gyu.

989
00:35:36.499 --> 00:35:38.910
What was the most recent
erotic film you've seen?

990
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.240
He asked about an erotic film
out of the blue.

991
00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.640
You must answer truthfully.

992
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.780
- If it's not you, then who is it?
- How much did you pay?

993
00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.780
- A movie?
- Yes.

994
00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.810
- A short movie.
- A movie.

995
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.879
Or it can be a video.

996
00:35:46.879 --> 00:35:48.649
A video. A drama.

997
00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.649
Hurry up. What are we going to do?

998
00:35:52.019 --> 00:35:54.149
- He needs time to think.
- My goodness.

999
00:35:54.149 --> 00:35:55.560
I can't believe this.

1000
00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.620
(He's finally speaking up.)

1001
00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.890
- What are you going to do?
- Jong Min.

1002
00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.359
(Time's up.)

1003
00:36:02.729 --> 00:36:04.499
(Min Gyu failed.)

1004
00:36:04.499 --> 00:36:05.870
It was risky.

1005
00:36:06.569 --> 00:36:08.300
(What kind of movie did he watch?)

1006
00:36:09.539 --> 00:36:10.899
(Mission accomplished.)

1007
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.410
They're hitting each other.

1008
00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:17.580
We're so naive.

1009
00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:19.280
- Hey, Min Gyu.
- Yes?

1010
00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.379
You're so naive. They got you.

1011
00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:23.280
- It's fine.
- You should just leave.

1012
00:36:23.419 --> 00:36:25.249
(Min Gyu. We trust you.)

1013
00:36:27.289 --> 00:36:29.089
(Due to Team Su Geun's continuous
great work)

1014
00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:30.789
- The thing is...
- Hani.

1015
00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:33.260
Hani helped us win.

1016
00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.100
Hani's so smart.

1017
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.399
Hani can't win.
Jong Min and I will win.

1018
00:36:37.399 --> 00:36:39.700
We'll give a chance to Hani.

1019
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.439
Hani. You need to kill four people.

1020
00:36:42.439 --> 00:36:44.240
- Hani please.
- Maybe she has a plan.

1021
00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.910
At least two people please.

1022
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:51.010
(What will be her question?)

1023
00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:52.850
Are you the Master Key?

1024
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.919
(A pretty quick Master Key question)

1025
00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:03.990
(It's important to check
who has the Master Key.)

1026
00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.689
(About this man)

1027
00:37:07.689 --> 00:37:12.600
(When he was checking
the final result last week,)

1028
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.600
(his red ears couldn't hide
that he's the Master Key.)

1029
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.640
(Will his ears respond again?)

1030
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.910
- Master Key?
- No.

1031
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.609
(Chan Sung's quite different
from the last time.)

1032
00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:25.709
Good job, Hani.

1033
00:37:25.709 --> 00:37:27.609
(His ears didn't change.)

1034
00:37:27.609 --> 00:37:30.050
- I should ask everyone.
- Good job, Hani.

1035
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.149
Explain how you reconcile with
the members after having a fight.

1036
00:37:33.149 --> 00:37:35.720
We drink and have a talk.

1037
00:37:36.419 --> 00:37:37.620
- Good job.
- Okay.

1038
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.129
- Are you the Master Key?
- Okay.

1039
00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:45.399
(She takes this chance
to check on Hong Gi.)

1040
00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:50.899
(When he was checking
the Master Key for the first time,)

1041
00:37:50.899 --> 00:37:54.269
(he made a mysterious look.)

1042
00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:57.209
(His first reaction was firm.)

1043
00:37:57.209 --> 00:37:58.780
- Good job.
- Are you the Master Key?

1044
00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.709
No.

1045
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:03.479
- What if you...
- I think it's you.

1046
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.050
(Is he acting?)

1047
00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.319
What if you go on a trip with CNU?

1048
00:38:07.319 --> 00:38:09.589
- Just the two?
- Where would you like to go?

1049
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.990
Borabora Island.
I really want to go there.

1050
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.629
- Where's that?
- With CNU?

1051
00:38:13.629 --> 00:38:15.560
- Borabora Island with CNU?
- Yes.

1052
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.859
She'd like to go to an island
with CNU.

1053
00:38:17.859 --> 00:38:22.370
(She needs a stronger question.)

1054
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.839
- What?
- Not yet.

1055
00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:26.010
How do you find me?

1056
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.609
- Good.
- You're really nice.

1057
00:38:29.609 --> 00:38:30.810
- How do you find me?
- Good.

1058
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.479
(He's being so honest.)

1059
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.379
(She didn't expect that reaction.)

1060
00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:37.450
Jong Min loves you.

1061
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.019
How do you find me?

1062
00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.390
(This is the chance.)

1063
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:44.830
I don't like you.

1064
00:38:45.689 --> 00:38:47.430
There's no point of talking.

1065
00:38:47.789 --> 00:38:49.100
Why would you even ask?

1066
00:38:49.629 --> 00:38:51.359
- She's reckless.
- It's this way.

1067
00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:52.899
How many times have you been
in a relationship?

1068
00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.899
This is the trap.

1069
00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.069
You'll stop laughing.

1070
00:38:56.439 --> 00:38:58.039
(Time's up.)

1071
00:39:00.169 --> 00:39:01.370
(P.O's out.)

1072
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.580
My goodness.

1073
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.950
(These questions are hard.)

1074
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.379
- Good job.
- That was good.

1075
00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:09.720
Great job, Hani.

1076
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.080
- She never sits down.
- Go sit down over there.

1077
00:39:11.919 --> 00:39:14.419
- See?
- How would you like the propose?

1078
00:39:14.419 --> 00:39:16.720
- This is a good one.
- Good.

1079
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.330
On a ship or something?

1080
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.100
As long as he proposes me in person.

1081
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.999
- In person.
- Directly in front of you?

1082
00:39:23.999 --> 00:39:25.430
- Yes.
- And do what?

1083
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.169
- It's the heart that matters.
- Right.

1084
00:39:27.169 --> 00:39:28.669
So that I can feel his heart.

1085
00:39:28.669 --> 00:39:30.439
Don't you need a present
or anything?

1086
00:39:30.439 --> 00:39:32.569
- No.
- It's not your turn.

1087
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:33.669
(Wait for your turn.)

1088
00:39:34.169 --> 00:39:35.609
Have you ever suffered
from hemorrhoids?

1089
00:39:35.609 --> 00:39:37.410
No. I never get it.

1090
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.310
What's the man's age
you can date up to?

1091
00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:45.149
(His evil intention again)

1092
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.620
It depends.

1093
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.890
I think I can date someone who's
10 years older than me.

1094
00:39:51.189 --> 00:39:53.330
(He's listening carefully.)

1095
00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.300
But I don't think I can date
anyone younger.

1096
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.560
- She likes older people.
- She has a good personality.

1097
00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.100
Which part of a woman's body...

1098
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.970
do you find attractive?

1099
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:03.539
- Ask Hong Gi.
- It's obvious.

1100
00:40:03.539 --> 00:40:07.410
(Time's running out, Hong Gi.)

1101
00:40:07.539 --> 00:40:10.140
- As I get old,
- Good job.

1102
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.609
(Time's up.)

1103
00:40:13.879 --> 00:40:15.649
Good job, Hong Gi.

1104
00:40:15.649 --> 00:40:18.490
(He should've been brief.)

1105
00:40:19.149 --> 00:40:21.919
You're talking too much.
You don't need to be nice.

1106
00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:24.019
(You'll never win this way.)

1107
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.589
Good job, Hani.

1108
00:40:28.499 --> 00:40:29.959
Hani's leading the team.

1109
00:40:29.959 --> 00:40:31.300
She's working hard.

1110
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.430
(She continues to work hard.)

1111
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.539
Good job, Hani.

1112
00:40:35.539 --> 00:40:38.169
You can never guess
when the time will end.

1113
00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:40.709
Tell me the three charms...

1114
00:40:40.709 --> 00:40:42.479
you think I have.

1115
00:40:42.479 --> 00:40:44.339
- You have pretty eyes.
- Right.

1116
00:40:44.339 --> 00:40:45.810
- You have a nice voice.
- Right.

1117
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.450
- And you're tall.
- Right.

1118
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:48.519
- She's pretty.
- You're pretty.

1119
00:40:48.519 --> 00:40:50.550
I can list more than 10.

1120
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.589
Keep going.

1121
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:55.220
By looking at the appearance,
which actor...

1122
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:56.660
do you like the best?

1123
00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.530
- Ideal type?
- Kang Ha Neul...

1124
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.300
- "Midnight Runners"?
- from "Midnight Runners".

1125
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.030
I've been thinking he's very hot.

1126
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.470
You can date him if you want.

1127
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.300
I'm not interested in relationships.

1128
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.569
Why?

1129
00:41:10.569 --> 00:41:13.310
Don't fall for it. Ask someone else.

1130
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:15.810
(She already fell for it.)

1131
00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.910
(Time's up.)

1132
00:41:19.249 --> 00:41:21.080
(Hani's out.)

1133
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:24.550
(She tried her best,
but Su Geun got her.)

1134
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.149
I got her.

1135
00:41:26.789 --> 00:41:27.789
Hani.

1136
00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:31.530
You did good, Hani.
Round of applause for her please.

1137
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.729
- Good job.
- She was honest.

1138
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.100
She was great.

1139
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.640
We don't know anything.

1140
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.669
- Right.
- No one's suspicious.

1141
00:41:43.669 --> 00:41:45.569
I'd choose this one.

1142
00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:47.970
- Anyway...
- Come on.

1143
00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.180
- Are you going to share with us?
- Listen to me.

1144
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.109
Someone could lie.

1145
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:53.450
Don't you trust your team?

1146
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:56.280
No. We're almost done now.

1147
00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.979
If you get a picture of your own,

1148
00:41:57.979 --> 00:41:59.720
you wouldn't say it's yours.

1149
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.089
Then let's go with this.

1150
00:42:01.419 --> 00:42:02.819
Not the place.

1151
00:42:02.819 --> 00:42:04.160
- Let's go with the dice.
- This one?

1152
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.030
- Let's go with this.
- Not the dice.

1153
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.160
- Let's just try it once.
- Isn't this the one?

1154
00:42:07.289 --> 00:42:08.899
- We'll go with the dice.
- The dice?

1155
00:42:08.899 --> 00:42:10.760
Who would you like to know, Hong Gi?

1156
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.499
- Who is it?
- The youngest.

1157
00:42:12.499 --> 00:42:13.499
- Min Gyu?
- Min Gyu.

1158
00:42:13.499 --> 00:42:15.600
He desperately wants Min Gyu's.

1159
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.499
I hope it's not from our own team.

1160
00:42:17.499 --> 00:42:19.470
(Don't kill your own team, Hong Gi.)

1161
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:24.479
(Time to check the key
by throwing the dice.)

1162
00:42:24.479 --> 00:42:25.950
I hope it's not from our own team.

1163
00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:28.479
(Who will the dice...)

1164
00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:32.950
(choose?)

1165
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.459
Are you throwing it?

1166
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.019
(Min Gyu?)

1167
00:42:38.019 --> 00:42:39.729
- Jun Hyun Moo.
- My gosh.

1168
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:41.760
Are you throwing it?

1169
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.999
(It looked like it was going to be
Min Gyu,)

1170
00:42:43.999 --> 00:42:46.269
(but it's Hyun Moo as it hits
the camera.)

1171
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.069
I can't believe this.

1172
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:50.370
It was Min Gyu at first.

1173
00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:51.910
Only if it wasn't the camera.

1174
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:54.339
Hyun Moo seemed pretty suspicious
today.

1175
00:42:54.339 --> 00:42:55.339
Is it going to be Hyun Moo?

1176
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.539
Yes. We choose him.

1177
00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.810
Okay.

1178
00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:02.019
(He gives a mysterious smile.)

1179
00:43:02.019 --> 00:43:04.950
Say it out loud, Elijah.

1180
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.390
- Yes.
- Say it out loud.

1181
00:43:07.189 --> 00:43:11.990
(It's time to judge.)

1182
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:14.289
Is this key the Master Key?

1183
00:43:14.289 --> 00:43:16.200
(Is this key the Master Key?)

1184
00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:21.430
(What is the truth...)

1185
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:25.269
(they will face?)

1186
00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:28.479
(After the first search mission,)

1187
00:43:28.479 --> 00:43:31.879
(they checked the 5 candidates.)

1188
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:35.580
(Hyun Moo was one of them.)

1189
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.519
(Is Hyun Moo's key...)

1190
00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:41.720
(the Master Key?)

1191
00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:48.700
(Or are four people's keys
the Master Key?)

1192
00:43:49.629 --> 00:43:51.430
(Hyun Moo's key...)

1193
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:55.439
(is revealed to Team Su Geun.)

1194
00:43:56.363 --> 00:43:59.595
<font color="#80ffff">[Kocowa Ver] SBS  E03 Master Key</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

1195
00:44:01.519 --> 00:44:04.450
Say it out loud, Elijah.

1196
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:05.890
- Yes.
- Say it out loud.

1197
00:44:06.689 --> 00:44:11.490
(It's time to judge.)

1198
00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:13.789
Is this key the Master Key?

1199
00:44:13.789 --> 00:44:15.700
(Is this key the Master Key?)

1200
00:44:18.229 --> 00:44:20.930
(What is the truth...)

1201
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:24.769
(they will face?)

1202
00:44:24.769 --> 00:44:27.979
(After the first search mission,)

1203
00:44:27.979 --> 00:44:31.379
(they checked the 5 candidates.)

1204
00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:35.080
(Hyun Moo was one of them.)

1205
00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.019
(Is Hyun Moo's key...)

1206
00:44:39.019 --> 00:44:41.220
(the Master Key?)

1207
00:44:41.419 --> 00:44:48.200
(Or are four people's keys
the Master Key?)

1208
00:44:49.129 --> 00:44:50.930
(Hyun Moo's key...)

1209
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:54.939
(is revealed to Team Su Geun.)

1210
00:44:56.169 --> 00:44:58.740
(Is his key the Master Key?)

1211
00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.310
(Hyun Moo...)

1212
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.749
(has the Master Key.)

1213
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.310
I can't see anything.

1214
00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:07.649
I didn't see it.

1215
00:45:07.819 --> 00:45:08.879
(Goodness)

1216
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.220
I can't see anything.

1217
00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:12.819
(Is what I saw...)

1218
00:45:12.819 --> 00:45:15.160
(real?)

1219
00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.220
It's just as I expected.

1220
00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.930
(Jun Hyun Moo)

1221
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:19.160
(After the result is out,)

1222
00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.459
(he quietly controls
the expression.)

1223
00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.669
(They don't know what's going on.)

1224
00:45:25.229 --> 00:45:26.569
(He tries to stay calm.)

1225
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:28.800
- How dare you!
- What?

1226
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.800
(He pretends it's not him.)

1227
00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.539
- Are you the one?
- Me?

1228
00:45:31.539 --> 00:45:33.609
Am I right?

1229
00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.539
Tell me if I'm right.

1230
00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.879
(It was clear...)

1231
00:45:38.879 --> 00:45:41.979
(from the beginning.)

1232
00:45:43.479 --> 00:45:47.819
(He was always so talkative
during the key judgment time.)

1233
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:52.089
(But something made him quiet
from the beginning.)

1234
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.399
(You have...)

1235
00:45:54.399 --> 00:45:56.629
(the Master Key.)

1236
00:45:56.959 --> 00:45:59.470
(After he checked the result,)

1237
00:45:59.729 --> 00:46:02.499
(he couldn't stop smiling.)

1238
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:06.769
(Hyun Moo starts to hide
the expression.)

1239
00:46:06.769 --> 00:46:12.550
(Other members' suspicions
helped him.)

1240
00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:16.379
(And he had a chance.)

1241
00:46:16.519 --> 00:46:23.019
(The list of five candidates...)

1242
00:46:23.019 --> 00:46:26.330
(had his name on it.)

1243
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:34.800
(He deceived the members,)

1244
00:46:34.999 --> 00:46:39.410
(and at the same time,)

1245
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:44.080
(Hyun Moo confirmed the other four
don't have the Master Key.)

1246
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:48.019
(He's revealed to Team Su Geun.)

1247
00:46:48.019 --> 00:46:50.120
Every life has...

1248
00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.890
an unexpected twist.

1249
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:53.220
He's such a great actor.

1250
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.459
(He must find the other person.)

1251
00:46:54.689 --> 00:46:55.890
We must stay together.

1252
00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.089
- Is it true, Hyun Moo?
- They're lying.

1253
00:46:58.089 --> 00:46:59.129
- Hyun Moo.
- Yes?

1254
00:46:59.129 --> 00:47:00.229
(Other Team Hyun Moo members still
don't understand what's going on.)

1255
00:47:00.229 --> 00:47:01.229
Is it you?

1256
00:47:01.229 --> 00:47:02.229
(You'll be surprised to
see the result.)

1257
00:47:02.229 --> 00:47:03.800
- Really? Aren't you nervous?
- You'll be amazed.

1258
00:47:04.899 --> 00:47:06.870
- I'm so curious.
- Are you acting?

1259
00:47:07.269 --> 00:47:08.939
Would you say it if you were me?

1260
00:47:08.939 --> 00:47:10.169
Just this once please.

1261
00:47:10.439 --> 00:47:11.569
Then now...

1262
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:13.970
You're so good.
You're a great actor.

1263
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:15.310
We must win the last game.

1264
00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:16.740
- We need to win.
- We must win.

1265
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.749
(Team Hyun Moo must win
the last game.)

1266
00:47:17.749 --> 00:47:19.080
I find...

1267
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:20.850
Su Geun suspicious.

1268
00:47:21.249 --> 00:47:24.350
(Hong Gi suddenly finds Su Geun
suspicious.)

1269
00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.720
(Why Su Geun...)

1270
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.160
(out of the blue?)

1271
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.689
- It's so out of the blue.
- He knows...

1272
00:47:31.689 --> 00:47:33.990
where the key is hidden,

1273
00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.999
but he's not showing the picture.

1274
00:47:35.999 --> 00:47:37.830
That's nonsense.

1275
00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.800
(That's a good source
of information.)

1276
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:42.740
I know where you found the key.

1277
00:47:42.839 --> 00:47:44.970
- The thing is...
- Why would you interrupt?

1278
00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:46.539
Why are we going individual?

1279
00:47:46.539 --> 00:47:48.010
Thank you for the information.

1280
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:49.439
Let's keep going.

1281
00:47:49.439 --> 00:47:51.780
- We should find it.
- You're looking for the key.

1282
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.580
(Is Su Geun the Master Key
as Hong Gi expected?)

1283
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.249
We shouldn't use the last key yet.

1284
00:47:57.249 --> 00:47:59.649
You picked the wrong person.

1285
00:47:59.649 --> 00:48:01.789
He's pretty suspicious.

1286
00:48:01.789 --> 00:48:03.160
What are you talking about?

1287
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.890
What are you doing?
I'm older than you.

1288
00:48:06.229 --> 00:48:09.229
(Su Geun's hiding the picture
of the key,)

1289
00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:14.269
(and Hong Gi's pointing at him.)

1290
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.839
(Who's the last Master Key?)

1291
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.749
- This is the last game.
- Let's do it.

1292
00:48:26.749 --> 00:48:28.550
The last round. The last game.

1293
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.620
"Monkey Bars".

1294
00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.249
(The third search mission,
"Monkey Bars")

1295
00:48:33.819 --> 00:48:36.789
It's simple. Both teams hang
to the monkey bar,

1296
00:48:36.789 --> 00:48:40.459
and you must drop the whole team
to win.

1297
00:48:40.629 --> 00:48:41.660
You're out as soon as you fall.

1298
00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.899
Is this the resting area?

1299
00:48:43.899 --> 00:48:46.169
Can we come back here
if we get tired?

1300
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:49.899
We're going to play three rounds.

1301
00:48:49.899 --> 00:48:51.970
- We must pick...
- Who's going to play?

1302
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.939
players for each round.

1303
00:48:54.939 --> 00:48:57.109
I won't be in the first round.

1304
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:59.979
We need to get the start on them.

1305
00:49:00.609 --> 00:49:02.220
How can you all agree?

1306
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:04.490
- You should say no.
- No.

1307
00:49:04.649 --> 00:49:06.050
No.

1308
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:07.419
They know you're going to lose.

1309
00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:09.890
I can't reach it.

1310
00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:11.930
They know you're going to lose.

1311
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:12.959
(He becomes shy in front of
monkey bars.)

1312
00:49:12.959 --> 00:49:15.200
Hey, Hyun Moo.

1313
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.330
I'm sorry, but...

1314
00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.499
I can't reach it.

1315
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.499
You should've thought about me.

1316
00:49:22.499 --> 00:49:23.700
I didn't know you're on a mat.

1317
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.910
(He spits.)

1318
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.339
(He spits with all his heart.)

1319
00:49:28.339 --> 00:49:30.080
- Why would you spit?
- I'm sorry.

1320
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.209
What if I fall from trying to
grab it?

1321
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.310
- Out.
- Then you're out.

1322
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.519
(If he falls from trying to go on,
he's out.)

1323
00:49:34.519 --> 00:49:35.580
You're out as soon as
you touch the ground.

1324
00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.289
- I have to jump high.
- He's not strong enough.

1325
00:49:38.289 --> 00:49:40.050
- I'm not strong enough.
- Go on someone's back.

1326
00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:41.160
What are you talking about?

1327
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.019
I wouldn't go on someone's back.
I'm over 40.

1328
00:49:43.019 --> 00:49:44.189
(He's too old to go on
someone's back.)

1329
00:49:44.189 --> 00:49:46.760
- Go ahead.
- Who am I competing against?

1330
00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.800
That's up to us.

1331
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.459
- We have to keep going.
- Sure.

1332
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.999
- Then...
- Someone easy for the start.

1333
00:49:51.999 --> 00:49:54.339
- Come here, Henry.
- Good.

1334
00:49:54.339 --> 00:49:56.370
(Hong Gi chooses Henry.)

1335
00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:57.910
No way.

1336
00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.669
(There can't be two suns
in Master Key.)

1337
00:49:59.669 --> 00:50:01.109
He can reach it at once.

1338
00:50:01.609 --> 00:50:03.479
(It's time to check who the man
of Master Key is.)

1339
00:50:03.479 --> 00:50:05.450
You're out if you touch
the green mat.

1340
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.850
(This is a rivalry match.)

1341
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:10.720
(The 1st match between
Hong Gi and Henry)

1342
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.189
(Hong Gi wins.)

1343
00:50:14.189 --> 00:50:16.919
(Take this.)

1344
00:50:18.229 --> 00:50:19.729
That probably hurt.

1345
00:50:19.729 --> 00:50:21.600
(It burns.)

1346
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.660
Come on, Hong Gi.

1347
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:26.030
(The 2nd match between
Hong Gi and Henry)

1348
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.470
(Henry wins.)

1349
00:50:29.269 --> 00:50:30.470
Henry wins.

1350
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:32.640
(And today, the last match begins.)

1351
00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.439
- I approve.
- You still did good.

1352
00:50:35.209 --> 00:50:36.780
I'm sorry.

1353
00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:37.810
It's three out.

1354
00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:39.379
Okay, first round.

1355
00:50:39.379 --> 00:50:41.580
- We must win.
- Get ready.

1356
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.019
- Go, Hong Gi.
- Set.

1357
00:50:43.019 --> 00:50:44.050
(Which team will win the first round
of Monkey Bar?)

1358
00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:45.120
(The 1st round begins.)

1359
00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.189
- Good job.
- Good.

1360
00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.789
Go, Hong Gi.

1361
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:49.120
- Good job.
- Good.

1362
00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.519
- Don't hurt yourselves.
- Good job.

1363
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:52.260
Raise your knees.

1364
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.560
- Goodness.
- I'm scared.

1365
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.060
(He's deep into the game.)

1366
00:50:56.359 --> 00:50:57.629
- Watch out.
- Get closer.

1367
00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:00.269
- It's too dangerous.
- Protect yourself.

1368
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:07.370
(Henry's out.)

1369
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:09.180
Now's your chance.

1370
00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.209
(He barely touched him.)

1371
00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:13.649
What was that?

1372
00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:18.350
(The light kick made him fall
like a feather.)

1373
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.319
(I'm the real winner.)

1374
00:51:21.319 --> 00:51:22.560
It was so strong.

1375
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.859
- What?
- We won.

1376
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:26.689
I'm sorry that I have long legs.

1377
00:51:26.689 --> 00:51:27.859
(The winner's body)

1378
00:51:27.859 --> 00:51:29.129
It was unexpected.

1379
00:51:29.129 --> 00:51:30.459
Good job, Hong Gi.

1380
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.800
Here I come.

1381
00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.899
(Next up is Jong Min and Eun Hyuk.)

1382
00:51:33.899 --> 00:51:34.939
Wait.

1383
00:51:34.939 --> 00:51:36.970
Eun Hyuk's pretty good.

1384
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:38.010
He's got skills.

1385
00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:39.539
- I can do it.
- What are you doing?

1386
00:51:39.539 --> 00:51:41.180
Don't do that.

1387
00:51:41.439 --> 00:51:42.780
That's it.

1388
00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:45.609
That's it.

1389
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:49.080
(Attack like a chicken)

1390
00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.220
(Look at him.)

1391
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.220
His feet stink.

1392
00:51:51.289 --> 00:51:54.519
I need your help, Su Geun.

1393
00:51:54.519 --> 00:51:55.519
Hey.

1394
00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:57.490
(The short leader marches.)

1395
00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:00.999
You have to help him, Min Gyu.

1396
00:52:00.999 --> 00:52:03.129
(Min Gyu joins.)

1397
00:52:03.129 --> 00:52:04.200
That's it.

1398
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.269
(Long leg attack)

1399
00:52:05.269 --> 00:52:06.430
Min Gyu can do it.

1400
00:52:06.999 --> 00:52:08.069
They're short.

1401
00:52:09.669 --> 00:52:12.810
(Four people left in each team.)

1402
00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:13.839
What was that?

1403
00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.539
Hurry up.

1404
00:52:16.539 --> 00:52:18.479
Hurry up before they go back.

1405
00:52:19.649 --> 00:52:21.649
That's awesome.

1406
00:52:21.649 --> 00:52:22.720
Go help him.

1407
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.720
(Strong high kick)

1408
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.350
That's great.

1409
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:28.359
(After a long match between
the long legs)

1410
00:52:28.359 --> 00:52:29.519
Go help him.

1411
00:52:29.819 --> 00:52:30.819
Good job, Hong Gi.

1412
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.189
(Min Gyu's out.)

1413
00:52:34.189 --> 00:52:36.300
- Help him.
- Get him.

1414
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.069
Come back, Hong Gi.

1415
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:40.200
Come back, Hong Gi.

1416
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.600
Hong Gi has really long legs.

1417
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.470
Come back, Hong Gi.

1418
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:45.539
(CNU is ready to march.)

1419
00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.010
I want to help him.

1420
00:52:48.539 --> 00:52:49.609
Try it, Hong Gi.

1421
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:50.709
(He marches forward.)

1422
00:52:51.479 --> 00:52:52.510
No.

1423
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:55.120
(Hong Gi puts his legs around him.)

1424
00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.580
(Here I come.)

1425
00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:57.580
(How dare you!)

1426
00:52:57.850 --> 00:52:58.950
Go, Su Geun.

1427
00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.419
- Hey, wait.
- No.

1428
00:53:00.419 --> 00:53:02.260
Go help him.

1429
00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.289
Get him.

1430
00:53:03.919 --> 00:53:04.930
Get him.

1431
00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:05.930
(It's a mess.)

1432
00:53:09.359 --> 00:53:10.459
(His leg slips in.)

1433
00:53:11.399 --> 00:53:14.399
(The counterattack of a short leg)

1434
00:53:15.939 --> 00:53:17.269
Who's in the game?

1435
00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:19.470
(He's chocked.)

1436
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:20.539
Hong Gi's out.

1437
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:23.879
Why would you step on me, Su Geun?

1438
00:53:23.879 --> 00:53:26.080
He got it.

1439
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:28.680
(He's on it.)

1440
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.749
I got it.

1441
00:53:29.749 --> 00:53:32.089
- He got it.
- I got it.

1442
00:53:33.519 --> 00:53:34.560
He got it.

1443
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.620
(Eun Hyuk and CNU are out.)

1444
00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.789
No way.

1445
00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:40.289
Who's playing the game?

1446
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:43.560
I'm sorry.

1447
00:53:44.899 --> 00:53:45.899
- I'm sorry.
- No.

1448
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.640
(I tried my best.)

1449
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.839
- Good job.
- What did you think?

1450
00:53:51.209 --> 00:53:52.439
You were great.

1451
00:53:52.439 --> 00:53:53.609
Compliment me.

1452
00:53:53.609 --> 00:53:55.810
I thought he was a snake.

1453
00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:57.010
He got in between.

1454
00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:58.550
He slipped in.

1455
00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:00.550
- How did you get here?
- I just did.

1456
00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:01.819
(Elijah and Chan Sung on Team
Su Geun and Hani on Team Hyun Moo)

1457
00:54:01.819 --> 00:54:03.280
- Hey, Hani.
- Why am I always the last?

1458
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.450
You have to sacrifice yourself.

1459
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:05.720
You're our last hope.

1460
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.260
Hani's the solution to our team.

1461
00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.459
- It's Hani.
- Pardon?

1462
00:54:09.459 --> 00:54:11.430
Let's start, Hani.

1463
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:12.589
Here it goes.
The game between women.

1464
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:15.300
Revenge.

1465
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.959
(Will it be a revenge or
continuous winning?)

1466
00:54:17.729 --> 00:54:20.370
(The first search mission
five hours ago)

1467
00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:22.339
(She was...)

1468
00:54:22.339 --> 00:54:24.069
(pushed around.)

1469
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:27.370
(Lee Elijah suffered.)

1470
00:54:28.339 --> 00:54:30.539
(I'll never forget this.)

1471
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.310
(This is the real revenge match.)

1472
00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:34.850
Let's start, Hani.

1473
00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:36.519
Make her pay for what happened
in the car.

1474
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.149
- Good.
- Good.

1475
00:54:38.149 --> 00:54:39.689
(March forward.)

1476
00:54:39.689 --> 00:54:40.919
- Good.
- Why would you hit me?

1477
00:54:40.919 --> 00:54:43.490
Good. Awesome.

1478
00:54:44.459 --> 00:54:46.390
What's that?

1479
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:47.490
It's advantageous to Hani.

1480
00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:49.830
Little more.

1481
00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:51.370
(They're hitting each other.)

1482
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:53.700
(The audience is excited.)

1483
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.800
Watch out, Hani.

1484
00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.870
That's great.

1485
00:54:56.339 --> 00:54:58.609
- Go.
- That's right.

1486
00:54:58.609 --> 00:55:01.580
(She wraps her legs
around her waist.)

1487
00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:02.910
- That's it.
- That's good.

1488
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:05.479
(Will she fall or keep hanging?
That's the question.)

1489
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:07.580
- I'm sorry.
- Pull her down.

1490
00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.149
Wrap your legs around.

1491
00:55:10.519 --> 00:55:11.550
Chan Sung.

1492
00:55:12.519 --> 00:55:13.850
(I'm coming.)

1493
00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:15.060
Chan Sung.

1494
00:55:15.189 --> 00:55:16.560
(He swings his legs around.)

1495
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.760
What are you doing?

1496
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.229
(He attacks by wrapping
his legs around.)

1497
00:55:19.229 --> 00:55:20.229
Are you a man?

1498
00:55:20.959 --> 00:55:22.200
How could you?

1499
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.830
(He thinks it should be
a fair play.)

1500
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.300
- Are you a man?
- Wait.

1501
00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.939
(Elijah is eliminated.)

1502
00:55:28.939 --> 00:55:30.700
- Stop it.
- Don't give up.

1503
00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:34.410
You're doing well.

1504
00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:36.180
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

1505
00:55:38.749 --> 00:55:40.010
Nice game.

1506
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:41.919
Hani, you're impressive.

1507
00:55:41.919 --> 00:55:43.350
- I'm sorry.
- Seriously.

1508
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:45.419
- I'm sorry, Hani.
- She's not a man.

1509
00:55:45.519 --> 00:55:47.859
Hani isn't a man.

1510
00:55:48.019 --> 00:55:50.120
- Chan Sung is crazy.
- I usually...

1511
00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.560
don't attack women, but she's a man.

1512
00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:53.830
"She's a man"?

1513
00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:55.200
How could you say that?

1514
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.229
No one can defeat her
except Chan Sung.

1515
00:55:57.399 --> 00:55:59.970
- That's right.
- She should be considered a man.

1516
00:56:00.399 --> 00:56:02.140
- Let's see.
- The score is 1 to 0.

1517
00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.740
Shall we hold the final round?

1518
00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.810
- Team leaders go in the middle.
- Right.

1519
00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:07.839
- Hong Gi and Chan Sung.
- Okay.

1520
00:56:08.209 --> 00:56:10.910
- CNU and Min Gyu.
- If we win this, we're the winner.

1521
00:56:11.479 --> 00:56:13.580
- Get ready.
- Keep the promise.

1522
00:56:13.879 --> 00:56:15.050
Get ready.

1523
00:56:15.879 --> 00:56:17.550
- You can do it.
- Let's go.

1524
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:20.519
- You can do it.
- Let's go.

1525
00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.720
(Kicking hard)

1526
00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.830
(Consecutive high kicks)

1527
00:56:26.289 --> 00:56:28.629
(This round is extremely fun.)

1528
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.129
- I'll help you.
- Be careful.

1529
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.899
- Chan Sung.
- Go and help him.

1530
00:56:34.939 --> 00:56:36.600
- Go.
- Chan Sung.

1531
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.709
- That's right.
- Put your weight on him.

1532
00:56:39.669 --> 00:56:41.879
(Min Gyu aims for Hong Gi's hand.)

1533
00:56:43.039 --> 00:56:45.280
(Goodness)

1534
00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.950
(Hong Gi is out.)

1535
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:49.620
- Are you okay? I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

1536
00:56:50.019 --> 00:56:51.289
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

1537
00:56:51.289 --> 00:56:52.720
(How dare you treat
Hong Gi like that?)

1538
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:58.229
(Show us your strength, Su Geun.)

1539
00:57:00.689 --> 00:57:02.200
- Su Geun.
- What is he doing?

1540
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.729
(What did you do?)

1541
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:06.470
Su Geun.

1542
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:09.269
(He falls and crashes.)

1543
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.339
(Slipping)

1544
00:57:11.939 --> 00:57:14.379
(He hangs for 1 second.)

1545
00:57:14.379 --> 00:57:15.379
I'm sorry.

1546
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:17.339
Don't come near me.

1547
00:57:17.379 --> 00:57:18.680
Goodness.

1548
00:57:19.879 --> 00:57:21.749
I'm sorry. Don't come near me.

1549
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:23.120
Don't come near me.

1550
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:26.819
I'm sorry. Don't come near me.

1551
00:57:28.459 --> 00:57:29.459
(He hits.)

1552
00:57:30.289 --> 00:57:31.390
What are you doing?

1553
00:57:31.689 --> 00:57:32.959
Are you protecting me?

1554
00:57:32.959 --> 00:57:35.399
What are you doing? Stop it.

1555
00:57:35.999 --> 00:57:38.600
- Wait a minute.
- Stop.

1556
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:40.830
What are you doing?

1557
00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:42.700
It's 2 to 2.

1558
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.269
- What?
- What did you do?

1559
00:57:44.709 --> 00:57:46.140
What are the old men doing?

1560
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.939
I tried to grab this one,
but I slipped.

1561
00:57:48.979 --> 00:57:51.709
- Me too.
- They both fell quickly.

1562
00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:54.149
(Goodness)

1563
00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.149
(After Su Geun falls off...)

1564
00:57:57.149 --> 00:57:58.919
(Flapping)

1565
00:57:58.919 --> 00:58:00.450
(He falls as well.)

1566
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:01.959
What are you doing?

1567
00:58:01.959 --> 00:58:03.689
You're not as tall as you think.

1568
00:58:03.689 --> 00:58:06.060
- I tried to grab it.
- Me too.

1569
00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.030
I felt for you like a father,
Chan Sung.

1570
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:11.229
- What?
- I let the bar go.

1571
00:58:11.229 --> 00:58:13.129
Why did you dive?

1572
00:58:13.669 --> 00:58:15.470
That was difficult.

1573
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.870
- They're the best players.
- Let's go.

1574
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:19.709
You can do it.

1575
00:58:21.339 --> 00:58:23.109
He's attacking him.

1576
00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.310
He got it.

1577
00:58:24.709 --> 00:58:25.749
(Kicking)

1578
00:58:27.149 --> 00:58:28.220
(It's volatile.)

1579
00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.479
Come on, Chan Sung.

1580
00:58:29.479 --> 00:58:31.089
- It's fierce.
- Let's win.

1581
00:58:31.089 --> 00:58:33.089
- They're so strong.
- Let's win.

1582
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:34.959
Don't fall.

1583
00:58:34.959 --> 00:58:36.019
(They're face to face.)

1584
00:58:36.019 --> 00:58:37.459
He plays rough.

1585
00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:39.160
They play rough.

1586
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.629
(He tries to exhaust Chan Sung.)

1587
00:58:42.629 --> 00:58:44.569
- Come on.
- Go up.

1588
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:47.129
That's right.

1589
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:49.539
You should do well this time, CNU.

1590
00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:55.680
We won.

1591
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.539
That was amazing.

1592
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:59.879
We won.

1593
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:01.879
We won.

1594
00:59:01.879 --> 00:59:04.149
(Strength was
the determining factor.)

1595
00:59:04.149 --> 00:59:06.220
(They play another round
as the score is tied.)

1596
00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.289
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1597
00:59:08.859 --> 00:59:10.519
- I didn't even touch it.
- Did you go?

1598
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.430
- I didn't even touch it.
- I did.

1599
00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:13.990
- It's over.
- Really?

1600
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.330
I touched the bar.

1601
00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.430
(Screaming)

1602
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:19.729
- Really?
- I'm impressed.

1603
00:59:19.729 --> 00:59:21.769
I was too self-conscious to do it.

1604
00:59:23.039 --> 00:59:24.939
- It's 1 to 1.
- I see.

1605
00:59:24.939 --> 00:59:28.080
This final round is
the last round for today.

1606
00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:32.010
Both teams will get
a crucial hint.

1607
00:59:32.209 --> 00:59:33.749
We're almost there.

1608
00:59:33.749 --> 00:59:35.319
- We practically won.
- We're close.

1609
00:59:35.319 --> 00:59:37.149
- I'll play against Hong Gi.
- Should we start first?

1610
00:59:37.149 --> 00:59:39.089
No, I'll play against Jong Min.

1611
00:59:39.089 --> 00:59:41.319
- I play against Jong Min.
- The score is 1 to 1.

1612
00:59:41.319 --> 00:59:43.120
- Get ready.
- Will you grab it?

1613
00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.390
- 1, 2.
- Move more forward.

1614
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:47.260
- Goodness.
- That's right.

1615
00:59:48.459 --> 00:59:51.200
(They advance toward the opponents.)

1616
00:59:51.229 --> 00:59:53.970
- You look great.
- Which bar should I grab?

1617
00:59:54.569 --> 00:59:56.470
- You have to go, Jong Min.
- I know. Wait.

1618
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:59.339
- You must start, Jong Min.
- How? Wait.

1619
00:59:59.569 --> 01:00:02.510
(Hong Gi starts to climb up.)

1620
01:00:02.879 --> 01:00:05.410
- You must start, Jong Min.
- Come down.

1621
01:00:06.209 --> 01:00:08.249
(They move back.)

1622
01:00:08.249 --> 01:00:11.490
Go back. That's right.

1623
01:00:11.689 --> 01:00:12.789
Move forward, Hong Gi.

1624
01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:15.120
- Attack him.
- Gosh.

1625
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:18.260
That's cheating.

1626
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.160
I can't move back.

1627
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:24.930
Trust me, Hyun Moo.

1628
01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:27.330
Let go of your hands.

1629
01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:29.169
Just trust me.

1630
01:00:29.339 --> 01:00:30.640
Come on.

1631
01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.209
- Trust me.
- You must let go.

1632
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:34.609
You must let go.

1633
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:37.510
(He gets an electric shock.)

1634
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:39.350
Let go of your hands. I got you.

1635
01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:40.649
"Let go of your hands"?

1636
01:00:41.479 --> 01:00:43.050
This is torture.

1637
01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:44.050
(Goodness)

1638
01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:45.589
This is torture.

1639
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:47.660
(Hyun Moo is out.)

1640
01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.990
What have you done?

1641
01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:53.930
- Hey.
- Why did he grab me?

1642
01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.330
Go, Jong Min.

1643
01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:59.399
(Henry's target changes
to Jong Min.)

1644
01:00:59.569 --> 01:01:01.140
- Go, Jong Min.
- What is he doing?

1645
01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.939
- Why did he go there?
- Gosh.

1646
01:01:03.939 --> 01:01:06.410
- What are you doing?
- What?

1647
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:07.609
What are you doing?

1648
01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.039
- Elijah.
- Help me.

1649
01:01:10.039 --> 01:01:11.749
You should climb up.

1650
01:01:11.749 --> 01:01:13.109
Go up from the back.

1651
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:14.350
- Wait.
- Pull him.

1652
01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:15.479
He's out.

1653
01:01:15.479 --> 01:01:19.149
(Jong Min is out.)

1654
01:01:20.149 --> 01:01:22.919
(Henry's target changes to Elijah.)

1655
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:25.430
You're doing well.

1656
01:01:25.689 --> 01:01:27.330
- Wait.
- That's good.

1657
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:29.560
- Keep going.
- Hang onto him.

1658
01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.499
- Hang onto him.
- That hurts.

1659
01:01:31.769 --> 01:01:34.399
(She wraps her legs around
from the back.)

1660
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.470
I'm behind you.

1661
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:37.600
(She wraps around his neck.)

1662
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.370
Grab him tightly.

1663
01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.839
- Grab him tightly.
- That's good.

1664
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:45.280
(Henry is out.)

1665
01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.649
- You did it.
- Get some rest.

1666
01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:49.620
- Goodness.
- He freely moves back and forth.

1667
01:01:50.379 --> 01:01:52.950
- Seriously.
- Is this your home, Hong Gi?

1668
01:01:53.419 --> 01:01:55.819
- Wait, time out.
- Our team did well.

1669
01:01:56.819 --> 01:02:00.160
Shouldn't you look less confident
in this situation, Hani?

1670
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:02.200
Why do you look so confident?
It's 2 against 1.

1671
01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.030
She can handle it...

1672
01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:06.669
- as long as it's not Chan Sung.
- She's so confident.

1673
01:02:06.669 --> 01:02:07.769
(She's ready to fight
except Chan Sung.)

1674
01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:11.169
I'm a man, so I'll move
forward and wait.

1675
01:02:12.209 --> 01:02:13.910
- Okay.
- All right.

1676
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:15.310
- Will you grab the bar?
- Go.

1677
01:02:15.479 --> 01:02:16.640
Start first.

1678
01:02:17.209 --> 01:02:20.010
- He did it accurately.
- He's good.

1679
01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:21.479
Why is he so good?

1680
01:02:22.749 --> 01:02:24.689
(Get out of my way.)

1681
01:02:25.149 --> 01:02:27.789
He's crossing a bridge of love.

1682
01:02:27.859 --> 01:02:29.260
He looks like
he's from a golf course.

1683
01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:30.720
Just hit him.

1684
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.930
What is he doing?

1685
01:02:32.229 --> 01:02:33.629
He looks like
he's from a golf course.

1686
01:02:33.629 --> 01:02:35.160
Just hit him.

1687
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.959
Is this your home, Hong Gi?

1688
01:02:40.169 --> 01:02:41.769
Wrap your legs around his waist.

1689
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.999
That's right.

1690
01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.439
What's going on?

1691
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:48.240
- Move forward, Hong Gi.
- His arms are trembling.

1692
01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:49.740
She doesn't go easy on him.

1693
01:02:51.479 --> 01:02:54.479
(Hong Gi is out.)

1694
01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:56.149
Come here.

1695
01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.589
Are you okay?

1696
01:02:58.589 --> 01:03:00.120
- Hong Gi.
- She doesn't go easy on him.

1697
01:03:00.249 --> 01:03:01.260
We lost.

1698
01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:03.160
How could you dare
to go easy on her?

1699
01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.729
You lost a fair game.

1700
01:03:04.859 --> 01:03:07.729
Hani, you're the only hope
on our team.

1701
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:10.660
- Elijah is quite competitive too.
- Let's finish it.

1702
01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:12.569
This is the last game for today.

1703
01:03:12.569 --> 01:03:13.729
Get ready.

1704
01:03:13.899 --> 01:03:15.539
- Set.
- You win if you hold out.

1705
01:03:15.539 --> 01:03:16.569
(It's the last game.)

1706
01:03:16.569 --> 01:03:20.109
(Who will win this final round?)

1707
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:21.780
It's the last round.

1708
01:03:21.979 --> 01:03:23.410
- Set.
- You win if you hold out.

1709
01:03:23.839 --> 01:03:25.350
(The final round starts.)

1710
01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:26.410
It's about strength.

1711
01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:29.120
- You must start now.
- That's right.

1712
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.490
Can you give me another glove?

1713
01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:34.890
What is she doing? Ma'am?

1714
01:03:34.959 --> 01:03:36.620
- What are you doing?
- Is this a circus?

1715
01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.890
It's difficult only with arms.

1716
01:03:38.359 --> 01:03:41.060
- Why is she climbing up?
- What are you doing, ma'am?

1717
01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.030
She's smart.

1718
01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.499
She's advancing.

1719
01:03:44.629 --> 01:03:46.399
- There's nowhere to go.
- She must go back.

1720
01:03:46.629 --> 01:03:48.769
- Wait, it's difficult.
- What's wrong?

1721
01:03:48.769 --> 01:03:49.800
(She's relaxed.)

1722
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.870
What are you doing?

1723
01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:55.310
- Seriously.
- Start now.

1724
01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:57.180
- Come down.
- I'm so nervous.

1725
01:03:58.149 --> 01:03:59.180
(Elijah starts.)

1726
01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.720
- Hani is professional at this.
- She's so strong.

1727
01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.749
That's great.

1728
01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.350
That's great.

1729
01:04:05.419 --> 01:04:06.649
Keep attacking.

1730
01:04:06.649 --> 01:04:08.189
- Push her down.
- You got it.

1731
01:04:08.189 --> 01:04:09.660
- Push her.
- That's good.

1732
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.430
(She uses one foot
to keep her torso down.)

1733
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.629
- Go.
- Push her down.

1734
01:04:13.629 --> 01:04:15.359
- Come this way.
- Keep going.

1735
01:04:15.499 --> 01:04:17.899
(Elijah's unexpected attack)

1736
01:04:17.999 --> 01:04:20.399
- Come this way, Hong Gi.
- Push her down.

1737
01:04:20.399 --> 01:04:22.140
- Spread out the mat.
- I'm sorry, Hani.

1738
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:24.769
(Will she hold on or fall?)

1739
01:04:24.769 --> 01:04:26.169
You must climb up.

1740
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:28.379
- Hold it.
- Let go.

1741
01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:30.439
I'm sorry, Hani.

1742
01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:33.249
- Please catch her.
- We got her.

1743
01:04:33.249 --> 01:04:34.450
Let me go down.

1744
01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:35.979
Catch her now.

1745
01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:37.620
Put her down.

1746
01:04:37.819 --> 01:04:39.019
Put her down.

1747
01:04:39.019 --> 01:04:40.419
We're so kind.

1748
01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:42.760
- What?
- Aren't we very kind?

1749
01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.959
She came down like this.

1750
01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.430
Elijah wins.

1751
01:04:46.729 --> 01:04:48.660
She's very strong.

1752
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.760
(Team Su Geun wins.)

1753
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.499
Elijah is also smart.

1754
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.229
She saved her energy.

1755
01:04:54.229 --> 01:04:55.240
At the end,

1756
01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:56.269
she waited and got it.

1757
01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:57.669
Gather up, everyone.

1758
01:04:57.669 --> 01:04:59.839
- Which one should we pick?
- The photograph one for sure.

1759
01:04:59.839 --> 01:05:00.939
I don't know where it is.

1760
01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:03.039
Why would we choose
the photograph one?

1761
01:05:03.439 --> 01:05:05.180
- You're strange.
- Why are you so nervous?

1762
01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.780
He's strange too. Why
recommend the photograph one?

1763
01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:08.819
(Su Geun is acting strangely.)

1764
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:12.390
(6 hours ago, they were
looking for the key.)

1765
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:16.990
(Hong Gi was with Su Geun
at the key spot.)

1766
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.930
(This is amazing.)

1767
01:05:18.930 --> 01:05:20.490
(I've seen the spot.)

1768
01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:25.269
(They're starting to
be suspicious of him.)

1769
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:29.439
(I'm suspicious of Su Geun.)

1770
01:05:30.499 --> 01:05:32.510
(I know where Su Geun
found the key.)

1771
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:36.979
(Su Geun intentionally
avoids the photograph option...)

1772
01:05:36.979 --> 01:05:41.149
(on the Key Guide.)

1773
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.350
He's seen something.

1774
01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:44.990
Only the person who has
the key knows it. Nobody else.

1775
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:46.249
It's not that nobody else
knows it.

1776
01:05:46.249 --> 01:05:47.760
Jong Min doesn't know.
Nobody knows.

1777
01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.160
It's because you are
at an advantage.

1778
01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.830
- Please mind your own business.
- You remember who was beside you.

1779
01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:54.399
- We don't know.
- Why wouldn't you know that?

1780
01:05:54.399 --> 01:05:56.499
Let's check him with a lie detector.

1781
01:05:56.499 --> 01:05:58.169
It's the last round.

1782
01:05:58.169 --> 01:05:59.700
- How can I...
- Remember who was near you.

1783
01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.069
trust you?

1784
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:02.169
Will you tell me?

1785
01:06:02.169 --> 01:06:04.609
I will tell you.
I will really tell you.

1786
01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:06.640
I will really tell you.

1787
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.439
Why would you go with
the photograph one?

1788
01:06:08.439 --> 01:06:09.709
Su Geun is too worried.

1789
01:06:09.709 --> 01:06:11.080
- Let's go with that then.
- Let's go with this.

1790
01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.680
- Let's check one of our keys.
- Let's check one of our keys.

1791
01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.749
- We will check one of our keys.
- Okay.

1792
01:06:13.749 --> 01:06:16.080
- We will check one of our keys.
- We will check one of our keys.

1793
01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.580
We will go with Hong Gi.

1794
01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.390
Why? We should vote.

1795
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:21.089
- It's him.
- I want to see Su Geun's.

1796
01:06:21.089 --> 01:06:22.189
- How about you?
- I want to see Su Geun's.

1797
01:06:22.189 --> 01:06:24.459
- I choose Hong Gi.
- Choose one.

1798
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:27.189
- Su Geun.
- It's certainly Hong Gi.

1799
01:06:27.189 --> 01:06:28.629
- Su Geun.
- Hong Gi.

1800
01:06:28.629 --> 01:06:30.700
- It's Su Geun.
- It's him.

1801
01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.330
Okay. Go ahead.

1802
01:06:33.399 --> 01:06:35.669
- You are very flustered.
- He is very flustered.

1803
01:06:35.669 --> 01:06:37.200
But I don't know if he's
pretending to be flustered.

1804
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.069
- His face says he's got it.
- Why aren't you checking it?

1805
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:40.910
Why would I check my key?

1806
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:42.910
(Or is Hong Gi intentionally
making Su Geun look suspicious?)

1807
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:44.510
- His face says he's got it.
- He's very nervous.

1808
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:46.680
- Is this key the Master Key?
- Is this key the Master Key?

1809
01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.850
You can't hide it.

1810
01:06:48.249 --> 01:06:49.580
Su Geun, you can't block the view.

1811
01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.689
We have to check their faces.

1812
01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:54.089
Don't block the view.

1813
01:06:54.089 --> 01:06:56.959
(They are focused.)

1814
01:06:56.959 --> 01:06:58.660
Share the result
with your facial expression.

1815
01:06:59.859 --> 01:07:03.359
- Yes. Check their faces.
- Yes. Check their faces.

1816
01:07:03.499 --> 01:07:04.669
Don't block the view.

1817
01:07:07.939 --> 01:07:10.140
(Does Su Geun
have the Master Key?)

1818
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:12.439
What is it?

1819
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:14.580
(Su Geun is suspected
to have the Master Key.)

1820
01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:16.209
Why did you do that then?

1821
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:18.850
- What is it?
- Hong Gi's face showed it.

1822
01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:20.780
I told you.

1823
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.680
It's our goal to take the key.

1824
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.519
That's important. Okay?

1825
01:07:25.519 --> 01:07:26.620
He's gotten very talkative.

1826
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.319
That's what we need to do.

1827
01:07:28.319 --> 01:07:30.160
- Min Gyu, the Gold Chance Card.
- Yes.

1828
01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.589
- All right.
- I got it.

1829
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:33.260
I got it.

1830
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:35.100
Come on, Min Gyu.

1831
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.160
Choose 1 of the 2.

1832
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.769
(He can choose one
Gold Chance Card and use it.)

1833
01:07:37.769 --> 01:07:40.899
We got it. We got it.

1834
01:07:40.899 --> 01:07:42.470
If we won just once more...

1835
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.569
We don't have conviction either.

1836
01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:46.539
Nothing is certain at this point.

1837
01:07:46.539 --> 01:07:48.080
(It's their last chance to
narrow down the list.)

1838
01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.450
(Which Gold Chance Card
did Min Gyu choose?)

1839
01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:53.050
(You can check the key
of anyone you choose.)

1840
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:55.280
CNU, he's going to
ask to check my key.

1841
01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.780
Let's see.

1842
01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.950
- He's writing my name.
- All right.

1843
01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.519
He's written it already.

1844
01:08:00.519 --> 01:08:02.589
We got it. We got it.

1845
01:08:02.589 --> 01:08:05.229
(Who did Min Gyu choose?)

1846
01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.859
The lowered his hand
to write the middle letter.

1847
01:08:07.859 --> 01:08:09.160
- Lee Su...
- Lee.

1848
01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.470
(He chose Lee Hong Gi.)

1849
01:08:12.229 --> 01:08:14.300
He must've wrote down
his two guesses.

1850
01:08:14.939 --> 01:08:15.999
That key?

1851
01:08:16.939 --> 01:08:19.510
Is that key the Master Key?

1852
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:21.539
(He asked if Hong Gi's key
is the Master Key.)

1853
01:08:21.539 --> 01:08:22.740
Master Key.

1854
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:28.120
(It's the last chance
to find the Master Key.)

1855
01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.189
(Did Min Gyu
make the right guess?)

1856
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:32.319
Master Key.

1857
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.490
- He's disappointed.
- He's disappointed.

1858
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:41.859
- He's disappointed.
- Min Gyu.

1859
01:08:41.859 --> 01:08:43.959
- Isn't he disappointed?
- He's disappointed.

1860
01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.669
There's nothing much to it.

1861
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:48.669
- Next time...
- Let's keep it that way.

1862
01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:51.310
The person who can use it well
should get that.

1863
01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:53.539
- I know.
- It's hard to use it well.

1864
01:08:54.039 --> 01:08:56.180
- Let's go to the Master Key Room.
- Let's go.

1865
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.209
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1866
01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.019
- Wait. Wait.
- You are...

1867
01:09:05.019 --> 01:09:06.490
- I can't remember...
- You're asking me now.

1868
01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:08.560
I can't remember
which game we played.

1869
01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.830
I don't want to know
what the answer was.

1870
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:14.830
What were the questions?

1871
01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:15.859
I can't tell you.

1872
01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:17.629
It's just that I can't remember it.

1873
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:20.900
How many hours
have we spent on this?

1874
01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.100
(Who has the other Master Key?)

1875
01:09:22.699 --> 01:09:25.169
I am certain about Hong Gi.

1876
01:09:25.169 --> 01:09:27.209
He kept insisting
to go with the photograph one.

1877
01:09:27.369 --> 01:09:29.209
- That was confusing.
- He won't let us roll the dice.

1878
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:31.909
He knew we would find out about
him if ever his name comes out.

1879
01:09:31.909 --> 01:09:33.379
He was so worked up.

1880
01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.520
It's not me, you know?

1881
01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.050
But the photograph one...

1882
01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:39.390
would've put him on the spot.

1883
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:41.720
I think I got it wrong.

1884
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.390
He keeps smiling.

1885
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:45.959
Why is he smiling?

1886
01:09:46.089 --> 01:09:47.699
I know it now.

1887
01:09:47.699 --> 01:09:49.959
(Or is there another person?)

1888
01:09:49.959 --> 01:09:54.169
Finally, it's time
to find the winner.

1889
01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.470
This is too difficult.

1890
01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:59.669
- This is crazy.
- Let me get it just once.

1891
01:09:59.669 --> 01:10:01.209
Do we get to say
one final statement?

1892
01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.239
I don't know which one to write.

1893
01:10:03.239 --> 01:10:05.909
Everyone is looking around.

1894
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:08.550
(They get to vote on 2 people
suspected to have the Master Key.)

1895
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:11.220
Stop acting, Hong Gi.

1896
01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.249
(They are finished voting.)

1897
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:13.989
Here you go.

1898
01:10:13.989 --> 01:10:16.890
(The dice of fate is cast.)

1899
01:10:17.159 --> 01:10:20.129
Now, we will check...

1900
01:10:20.129 --> 01:10:22.900
the two people who
got the most votes.

1901
01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.300
Please light the two people...

1902
01:10:26.629 --> 01:10:28.169
who got the most votes.

1903
01:10:29.999 --> 01:10:31.709
That surprised me.

1904
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:34.709
It shouldn't be me. I am shy.

1905
01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.079
No. No.

1906
01:10:36.079 --> 01:10:40.709
(Hyun Moo has the Master Key.)

1907
01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:46.720
It's Hyun Moo.

1908
01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.320
(Hyun Moo is caught.)

1909
01:10:49.589 --> 01:10:50.860
This is crazy.

1910
01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.730
(Who is the other person
who got the most votes?)

1911
01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:57.230
(It's Lee Hong Gi.)

1912
01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:01.570
This is crazy.

1913
01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.869
(Does Hong Gi have
the other Master Key?)

1914
01:11:05.869 --> 01:11:07.169
If he doesn't have it,
he doesn't have it.

1915
01:11:07.169 --> 01:11:10.680
Here's the prize box.

1916
01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.749
- What is it?
- Is that the prize box?

1917
01:11:12.749 --> 01:11:16.749
(Only the winner gets
the golden prize.)

1918
01:11:16.749 --> 01:11:21.020
(Who will get this box?)

1919
01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.289
That surprised me.

1920
01:11:22.289 --> 01:11:23.919
Hong Gi and I will
go up the podium.

1921
01:11:23.919 --> 01:11:26.589
It never fails to surprise me
each week.

1922
01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.600
What do you think it is?

1923
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.499
I will say one last thing.

1924
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:37.709
I managed to fool people
so perfectly today,

1925
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:41.279
and that made me realize that
I should go back to acting.

1926
01:11:41.279 --> 01:11:44.310
People are debating
about this in the back.

1927
01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:46.010
Some say you two
are the right choices,

1928
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:47.550
- and some say you are not.
- I have no idea.

1929
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:49.579
- Look at that.
- Some think you're not the one.

1930
01:11:49.579 --> 01:11:52.089
- It's up here.
- Hong Gi is saying...

1931
01:11:52.119 --> 01:11:55.489
he's glad that he got to
fool everyone with his great acting.

1932
01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.629
He say he's good enough
to star in dramas again.

1933
01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:02.029
All right. Let's check it.

1934
01:12:02.129 --> 01:12:05.400
Let's check the Master Key.

1935
01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.070
This is really nerve-racking.

1936
01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.770
Please put the Master Key
in the hole.

1937
01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:12.770
(Is Hong Gi the one
on the same boat as Hyun Moo?)

1938
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:13.770
It's in.

1939
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:15.480
Are they the two people
who have the Master Keys?

1940
01:12:15.779 --> 01:12:18.749
Let's check the Master Key.

1941
01:12:19.779 --> 01:12:21.180
(It's open.)

1942
01:12:21.749 --> 01:12:23.779
(Hyun Mo's identity
is revealed.)

1943
01:12:23.779 --> 01:12:24.850
Bye.

1944
01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:28.419
(Now Hong Gi has the other key.)

1945
01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.860
(I am suspicious of Su Geun.)

1946
01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.629
(Hong Gi continuously insisted
to suspect Su Geun.)

1947
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:40.970
(Was it part of his plan? Or was
he really suspicious of Su Geun?)

1948
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:42.070
Here we go.

1949
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:46.470
(The truth will be revealed now.)

1950
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:50.079
(Does Hong Gi have
the other Master Key?)

1951
01:12:55.579 --> 01:12:59.050
(His key is not the Master Key.)

1952
01:13:00.919 --> 01:13:04.860
(Hong Gi is crossed out
from the list.)

1953
01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.329
- I told you I don't have it.
- What?

1954
01:13:07.329 --> 01:13:09.560
You should be on a drama.

1955
01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:12.999
I have to go back to acting.

1956
01:13:12.999 --> 01:13:14.900
- I don't have it.
- He doesn't have it.

1957
01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:17.499
I said I don't have it. He's got it.

1958
01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.980
(At the Room of Fate)

1959
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.610
Hong Gi talks when he's nervous.

1960
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:25.180
I hope Hong Gi gets to feel
how I felt last week.

1961
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:26.709
Or Jong Min.

1962
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:30.079
(Hong Gi didn't
have the Master Key.)

1963
01:13:30.579 --> 01:13:33.050
It's clear that Hyun Moo has it.

1964
01:13:33.489 --> 01:13:36.989
Elijah is the second person
who got the most votes.

1965
01:13:37.489 --> 01:13:39.089
- Please go up the podium.
- Is it Hyun Moo and Elijah?

1966
01:13:39.089 --> 01:13:41.260
- It's them.
- Is it Hyun Moo and Elijah?

1967
01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.360
Yes.

1968
01:13:42.829 --> 01:13:45.470
She suddenly started laughing,
and it's scary.

1969
01:13:46.199 --> 01:13:47.699
She suddenly looks scary.

1970
01:13:47.699 --> 01:13:48.699
What?

1971
01:13:48.699 --> 01:13:50.070
She's a great actress.

1972
01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:51.970
Elijah.

1973
01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:53.169
(Is there another truth
behind her smile?)

1974
01:13:53.169 --> 01:13:56.909
Let's check Elijah's key.

1975
01:13:58.379 --> 01:13:59.579
- Elijah.
- Does she have the Master Key?

1976
01:13:59.579 --> 01:14:01.320
If she has the Master Key,
she's the best actor among us.

1977
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.520
- All right.
- I had no idea.

1978
01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.249
Let's check Elijah's key.

1979
01:14:08.459 --> 01:14:11.260
(It failed to unlock.)

1980
01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:13.789
- Is it not her?
- It's not her.

1981
01:14:13.789 --> 01:14:14.999
That surprised me.

1982
01:14:14.999 --> 01:14:16.400
The possibility is going higher.

1983
01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.900
- Is it not her? Who is it?
- Who is it then?

1984
01:14:19.699 --> 01:14:23.270
Min Gyu got the third most votes.

1985
01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:24.470
- Please go up the podium.
- Min Gyu.

1986
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:26.209
- It's not Min Gyu.
- If it's Min Gyu...

1987
01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:27.539
- Min Gyu?
- I am suspicious of him too.

1988
01:14:27.539 --> 01:14:29.909
- I suspected him.
- You'd get goosebumps, right?

1989
01:14:29.909 --> 01:14:31.180
- Min Gyu.
- Why is he smiling?

1990
01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.949
- Right?
- Wait.

1991
01:14:32.949 --> 01:14:34.180
You don't have it, do you?

1992
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.850
- I've got no surprise.
- No?

1993
01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:38.449
Let's check Min Gyu's key.

1994
01:14:39.619 --> 01:14:40.850
(It's not the Master Key.)

1995
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:42.619
(Min Gyu is crossed out
from the list too.)

1996
01:14:42.619 --> 01:14:44.430
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

1997
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:45.829
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

1998
01:14:45.829 --> 01:14:47.699
- Really?
- It's not him.

1999
01:14:48.199 --> 01:14:49.529
Should I go?

2000
01:14:49.529 --> 01:14:50.959
We have to keep going
until we find that person.

2001
01:14:51.199 --> 01:14:53.230
Next is Hyun Moo and I.

2002
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:54.600
But he's not the one.

2003
01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.339
- I think it's him.
- Really?

2004
01:14:56.339 --> 01:14:58.839
I don't think so.

2005
01:14:58.839 --> 01:15:01.510
Please put the Mater Key.

2006
01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.539
It feels different going in,
doesn't it?

2007
01:15:03.839 --> 01:15:04.980
It feels different going in,
doesn't it?

2008
01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:06.110
(Su Geun is unusually
confident today.)

2009
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:07.879
- It's in.
- I think it's him.

2010
01:15:07.879 --> 01:15:09.449
- All right.
- Su Geun.

2011
01:15:09.449 --> 01:15:11.089
(Does he have the Master Key?)

2012
01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:12.320
No way.

2013
01:15:12.589 --> 01:15:16.419
(Whenever Hong Gi mentioned
about the photograph hint,)

2014
01:15:16.419 --> 01:15:18.959
(he was strongly against it.)

2015
01:15:20.089 --> 01:15:24.430
(He was unusually sensitive
when checking the Key Guide.)

2016
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:26.499
(Is he the one
with the other Master Key?)

2017
01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.470
- It's in.
- I think it's him.

2018
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:31.070
- All right.
- Su Geun.

2019
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:32.970
- Please say the line.
- Let's check it.

2020
01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:35.039
- Let's check Su Geun's key.
- Let's check Su Geun's key.

2021
01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:37.909
(What's the truth behind...)

2022
01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:39.949
(Su Geun's key?)

2023
01:15:39.949 --> 01:15:41.050
- Please say the line.
- Let's check it.

2024
01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:42.220
Let's check...

2025
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.379
- Su Geun's key.
- Let's check Su Geun's key.

2026
01:15:43.379 --> 01:15:46.520
(They check Su Geun's key.)

2027
01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.619
(It's not the Master Key.)

2028
01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:55.300
(Su Geun is crossed out as well.)

2029
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.430
(Now 3 people remain.)

2030
01:15:56.730 --> 01:15:59.999
- Now...
- What's going on?

2031
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:01.999
Wait. This can't happen.

2032
01:16:01.999 --> 01:16:03.940
- Is it him?
- Let's pause.

2033
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.209
- Tell us who are remaining.
- Tell us who are remaining.

2034
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:06.470
- Tell us.
- Will you tell us that?

2035
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:07.640
Just tell us who are remaining.

2036
01:16:07.739 --> 01:16:09.180
Which ones are remaining?

2037
01:16:09.879 --> 01:16:11.180
No way.

2038
01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:12.180
(1 of them must
have the Master Key.)

2039
01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:14.320
Please come up...

2040
01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.379
to the podium..

2041
01:16:15.379 --> 01:16:16.379
(They check who has
the other Master Key.)

2042
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:18.190
(Who has fooled everyone?)

2043
01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:19.419
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

2044
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:20.850
Is it an error?

2045
01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:21.890
(Eun Hyuk goes up the podium.)

2046
01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:28.659
(Eun Hyuk had
the other Master Key.)

2047
01:16:28.659 --> 01:16:32.199
(He's been having the Master Key
for 2 consecutive weeks.)

2048
01:16:32.199 --> 01:16:34.339
- No way.
- He's a con artist.

2049
01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:35.400
Eun Hyuk.

2050
01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.640
Who did you write?

2051
01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.110
You improved a lot in a week.

2052
01:16:40.339 --> 01:16:41.940
Is this key the Master Key?

2053
01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:44.709
(At the Judgement Cabinet,)

2054
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:45.779
(He's acting.)

2055
01:16:45.779 --> 01:16:49.720
(he checked that
his key is the Master Key.)

2056
01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.220
His is not the Master Key.

2057
01:16:51.289 --> 01:16:52.589
He doesn't have it.

2058
01:16:52.589 --> 01:16:53.690
He doesn't have it.

2059
01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:55.789
(I can't believe I found
the Master Key twice in a row.)

2060
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.629
One of them has the Master Key.

2061
01:16:58.629 --> 01:17:00.230
(Eun Hyuk learned from last week
and moved stealthily.)

2062
01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.100
(Hyun Moo, Henry, Hani,
Jong Min, CNU)

2063
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:04.329
(One of them had
the Master Key,)

2064
01:17:04.329 --> 01:17:08.440
(but his name wasn't on it.)

2065
01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.869
(He began stealthily
planning to conceal his identity.)

2066
01:17:11.539 --> 01:17:17.379
(Eun Hyuk has been tracking
the Master Key owner until the end.)

2067
01:17:17.579 --> 01:17:20.409
(Meanwhile, he quietly and
stealthily watched everyone.)

2068
01:17:20.409 --> 01:17:23.520
(It was the judgement time.)

2069
01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:29.659
Who's taking it?
I don't know.

2070
01:17:29.959 --> 01:17:32.690
What happens
if only one of them has it?

2071
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:34.029
Then it means another person
has the Master Key.

2072
01:17:34.029 --> 01:17:35.560
So another person will go up there.

2073
01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.129
Right. The person who has
the second most votes will go up.

2074
01:17:37.129 --> 01:17:38.169
(Until the last moment,
he hid his identity.)

2075
01:17:38.999 --> 01:17:42.140
(Even now, he's keeping
a poker face.)

2076
01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:44.169
Let's check his key.

2077
01:17:44.169 --> 01:17:45.709
(Eun Hyuk's key is checked.)

2078
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:47.110
He's got the Master Key.
It's spinning.

2079
01:17:47.539 --> 01:17:50.640
(His key is the Master Key.)

2080
01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.010
I didn't suspect him at all.

2081
01:17:53.010 --> 01:17:54.879
He improved so much
in just a week.

2082
01:17:54.879 --> 01:17:56.949
I am starting to get better.

2083
01:17:57.279 --> 01:17:59.249
So two people from the same team
had the Master Keys.

2084
01:17:59.249 --> 01:18:01.159
That's not the problem.

2085
01:18:01.159 --> 01:18:03.360
Usually, nobody is interested in me,

2086
01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.060
so nobody doubted me.

2087
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.659
That made me feel so good.

2088
01:18:06.659 --> 01:18:08.459
I was thrilled about
all the gold I was going to take.

2089
01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:10.959
But I am so unlucky.

2090
01:18:10.959 --> 01:18:12.900
- The dice.
- The dice...

2091
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:16.999
hit the camera,
and my name was chosen.

2092
01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:20.669
- That shattered me.
- I thought you got X there.

2093
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:23.310
- Actually at that time...
- Why did you fail to guess him?

2094
01:18:23.539 --> 01:18:24.650
I had no idea that it could be him.

2095
01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:26.850
I thought he got an X.

2096
01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:27.980
- Right.
- They didn't know about each other.

2097
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:31.119
Please. Please let me come back.

2098
01:18:31.119 --> 01:18:32.489
Please let me come back
next week.

2099
01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:33.650
No way.

2100
01:18:33.690 --> 01:18:35.560
Good job, everyone.

2101
01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.260
Good job.

2102
01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:38.890
Master Key!

2103
01:18:38.890 --> 01:18:41.199
(The new story unfolds.)

2104
01:18:41.199 --> 01:18:43.060
We will come back next week.

2105
01:18:45.999 --> 01:18:47.029
(The new beginning)

2106
01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:55.180
(There will be 12 new players.)

2107
01:18:55.180 --> 01:19:00.850
(Two keys will shake their fates.)

2108
01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:02.879
(There are Angel's Master Key...)

2109
01:19:02.879 --> 01:19:06.550
(and Demon's Master Key.)

2110
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.890
(The new rules are set
for Angel and Demon Special.)

2111
01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.129
Raise your hands
if you are the angel.

2112
01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.860
(Everybody claims to be an angel.)

2113
01:19:14.129 --> 01:19:15.159
An angel enters.

2114
01:19:15.159 --> 01:19:16.659
(The moment you trust
another person,)

2115
01:19:16.659 --> 01:19:18.329
(you will be betrayed.)

2116
01:19:18.329 --> 01:19:19.930
(Sighing)

2117
01:19:20.329 --> 01:19:21.600
What will you do
if I am the demon?

2118
01:19:21.999 --> 01:19:23.770
I will bet everything
you want me to bet.

2119
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:28.310
(It will be a happy ending if
they find the Angel's Master Key.)

2120
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:32.610
(If they choose the Demon's,
they will lose everything.)

2121
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:33.980
(The angel will share everything.)

2122
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:35.919
What is that?

2123
01:19:35.919 --> 01:19:38.150
(Beautiful defeat versus
ugly victory)

2124
01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:41.020
(What would you choose?)

2125
01:19:41.589 --> 01:19:43.959
(The whereabouts of the Angel's
Master Key causes a chaos.)

2126
01:19:44.119 --> 01:19:45.959
(The demon swallows
everything alone.)

2127
01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:47.659
One of them is surely the demon.

2128
01:19:47.659 --> 01:19:53.730
(The moment you trust
the demon, you lose everything.)

2129
01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.400
(Angel's whisper
versus demon's temptation)

2130
01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:02.539
(Who will you hold hands with?)

2131
01:20:02.539 --> 01:20:03.839
This is the pit of fire.
