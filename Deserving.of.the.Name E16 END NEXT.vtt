00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.009
(Last Episode)

2
00:00:23.943 --> 00:00:25.582
Why are you so weak?

3
00:00:25.843 --> 00:00:27.053
Harder.

4
00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:32.353
I am trying hard.

5
00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:38.563
What is this sound?

6
00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:43.133
I feel that they are doing something intense upstairs.

7
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.633
Are they fighting?

8
00:00:48.073 --> 00:00:49.273
Go, Yeon Kyung.

9
00:01:00.713 --> 00:01:03.183
Next, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

10
00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:05.883
Throw back the head and raise the chin.

11
00:01:06.353 --> 00:01:08.652
- Why do we do this? - To open the airway.

12
00:01:08.652 --> 00:01:10.262
I know that.

13
00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:12.762
Yeon Kyung,

14
00:01:13.092 --> 00:01:15.392
I should demonstrate this on you.

15
00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:16.693
That's enough.

16
00:01:16.762 --> 00:01:18.902
Breathe two times, right now.

17
00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:27.073
Put pressure on the chest 30 times.

18
00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:31.282
Straighten your arms.

19
00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:32.982
Your palms should be located in the middle of the chest.

20
00:01:32.982 --> 00:01:35.012
Your fingers shouldn't touch the ribs.

21
00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:37.523
Why should I learn this?

22
00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:39.383
This?

23
00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:41.152
Don't you know how important this is?

24
00:01:41.152 --> 00:01:44.323
They don't have an ambulance there. You should at least learn...

25
00:01:44.323 --> 00:01:46.223
this before you go and save one more person.

26
00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:48.032
I am good at saving...

27
00:01:48.532 --> 00:01:49.863
people without this.

28
00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:52.062
I know, but...

29
00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:04.913
You should go back to the place where you belong.

30
00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:06.913
You saw...

31
00:02:07.883 --> 00:02:09.713
how people here live.

32
00:02:10.683 --> 00:02:12.352
There's no war here,

33
00:02:13.752 --> 00:02:15.752
and we have a lot of doctors and hospitals.

34
00:02:16.692 --> 00:02:17.863
We have emergency services,

35
00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.493
medicines, and food.

36
00:02:23.963 --> 00:02:25.803
We can live without your help.

37
00:02:27.402 --> 00:02:29.072
But Joseon is at war,

38
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:31.472
and there aren't many hospitals nor doctors.

39
00:02:33.613 --> 00:02:35.543
They lack medicine and food.

40
00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:40.713
There are many people who need your help.

41
00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:43.683
You need to go back to Joseon and protect it.

42
00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:45.622
But before that,

43
00:02:46.553 --> 00:02:48.293
just give me three days.

44
00:02:50.622 --> 00:02:51.822
Just three days.

45
00:02:58.502 --> 00:03:00.233
We're done with this one.

46
00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:02.872
Next, we have...

47
00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:10.043
Which one do you prefer?

48
00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:15.352
What is this?

49
00:03:18.222 --> 00:03:19.622
Is she not pretty?

50
00:03:19.622 --> 00:03:21.752
Did you meet another woman when you were in Joseon?

51
00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:23.562
No, that is not it.

52
00:03:23.562 --> 00:03:24.763
Look closely.

53
00:03:27.363 --> 00:03:30.132
She has a flat nose and small eyes.

54
00:03:30.132 --> 00:03:32.703
Gosh, she's not pretty enough.

55
00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:37.243
Gosh, you're so bad at this. Gosh, this is going to be a problem.

56
00:03:37.243 --> 00:03:38.372
It is you, Yeon Kyung.

57
00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:43.213
Oh, my. She's so pretty.

58
00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:47.252
I told you she was pretty. She's literally shining. So pretty.

59
00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:48.483
You're really good at drawing.

60
00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:52.523
Give it to me. Send this picture to Yeon Kyung.

61
00:03:56.652 --> 00:03:57.923
I am sending the picture.

62
00:04:03.062 --> 00:04:04.402
It's here.

63
00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:07.333
Oh, my. She's so pretty.

64
00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:08.532
What is next?

65
00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:11.402
Do you want to do this next?

66
00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:13.143
I want to do this next.

67
00:04:13.143 --> 00:04:14.143
We should do this.

68
00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:16.173
We have this too. How about this?

69
00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:17.812
Why do we need to decide what we do first?

70
00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:19.283
We can just do anything we want.

71
00:04:19.882 --> 00:04:21.913
Then why are we even making plans?

72
00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:23.952
Then why did you ask me to help you?

73
00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:25.553
Are you saying we shouldn't do anything?

74
00:04:25.683 --> 00:04:27.853
I want to do everything. But we do not have much time.

75
00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:29.923
We should do this first.

76
00:04:29.923 --> 00:04:31.723
I want to do this first.

77
00:04:31.723 --> 00:04:33.122
Then let's do this first.

78
00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:51.012
We don't need to go grocery shopping in a hurry.

79
00:04:51.483 --> 00:04:53.212
Gosh, why are you always hungry?

80
00:04:54.613 --> 00:04:56.452
Try living in Joseon.

81
00:04:57.223 --> 00:04:59.452
I don't normally eat much, so it'll be all right.

82
00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:03.122
If you say that in Joseon, people will get angry at you.

83
00:05:03.692 --> 00:05:06.022
Why do you always say that?

84
00:05:06.562 --> 00:05:07.793
Because you are always like that.

85
00:05:08.132 --> 00:05:09.832
You should order poison as my death penalty instead.

86
00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:14.973
Why did you have to buy so much? No one's going to eat this much.

87
00:05:15.072 --> 00:05:16.403
I will eat everything.

88
00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:18.142
Make sure you keep your word.

89
00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:19.803
If there are leftovers, I will take them to Joseon.

90
00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:22.512
We spent the whole day grocery shopping.

91
00:05:22.673 --> 00:05:24.113
I am leaving soon. That is the least you can do.

92
00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:27.582
Why do you keep saying that? I know that already.

93
00:05:27.913 --> 00:05:29.252
If you know that, you should not act like that.

94
00:05:29.252 --> 00:05:31.053
If I were you, I would treat you really nicely.

95
00:05:31.223 --> 00:05:32.653
That is not too hard to do.

96
00:05:34.752 --> 00:05:36.653
Why did you not do this for me earlier?

97
00:05:37.093 --> 00:05:38.892
We would not have bought so much and it would have taken less time.

98
00:05:40.192 --> 00:05:42.363
- Take a seat. - Oh, my.

99
00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:44.262
I made these food...

100
00:05:44.533 --> 00:05:45.962
for Master Choi, Byung Ki, and Jae Sook.

101
00:05:46.363 --> 00:05:48.473
I did the cooking. Take a seat.

102
00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.603
All right. It looks delicious.

103
00:05:51.173 --> 00:05:53.002
Oh, my. It smells nice.

104
00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:55.012
There's so much food here.

105
00:05:55.372 --> 00:05:57.113
You prepared so much.

106
00:05:57.683 --> 00:05:59.243
Is today a special day?

107
00:05:59.582 --> 00:06:00.983
It's not Master Choi's birthday.

108
00:06:00.983 --> 00:06:02.712
I realized that we never had a meal together.

109
00:06:04.053 --> 00:06:06.122
Please enjoy the meal we prepared for you.

110
00:06:07.153 --> 00:06:08.153
All right.

111
00:06:08.192 --> 00:06:10.593
We have more inside, so eat as much as you want.

112
00:06:12.822 --> 00:06:14.692
Master Choi, is it delicious?

113
00:06:14.793 --> 00:06:15.832
Yes.

114
00:06:17.062 --> 00:06:18.933
Yes, it's delicious.

115
00:06:19.702 --> 00:06:21.973
Jae Sook, do you like it?

116
00:06:23.002 --> 00:06:24.642
Is this even for human?

117
00:06:25.942 --> 00:06:29.312
It's delicious. I'm going to eat so much today.

118
00:06:30.543 --> 00:06:31.913
Enjoy your meal.

119
00:06:38.322 --> 00:06:39.622
Eat up.

120
00:07:26.903 --> 00:07:29.502
Why is she taking so long? We are in a hurry.

121
00:07:54.632 --> 00:07:57.062
Are you ready? Get in your position.

122
00:07:57.062 --> 00:07:59.363
You're complaining again. Go back to your place.

123
00:08:00.202 --> 00:08:01.332
We're ready.

124
00:08:04.202 --> 00:08:06.543
I'm ready. I'll press the button now.

125
00:08:18.752 --> 00:08:19.952
It's all right now.

126
00:11:02.612 --> 00:11:04.383
Next patient please.

127
00:11:10.923 --> 00:11:12.023
Dr. Heo?

128
00:11:14.092 --> 00:11:16.533
Why are you here?

129
00:11:16.533 --> 00:11:18.903
You asked for the next patient.

130
00:11:19.133 --> 00:11:20.933
I came here to get acupuncture.

131
00:11:20.933 --> 00:11:23.602
I have been going on so many dates with Dr. Choi...

132
00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:27.173
that my shoulder has started to ache since yesterday.

133
00:11:44.763 --> 00:11:46.763
Please go easy on me.

134
00:11:47.933 --> 00:11:50.202
I didn't apply acupuncture yet.

135
00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:55.933
If I were you, I would apply acupuncture at a different spot.

136
00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:59.003
It is about Houxi, Kunlun, and Tonggu.

137
00:12:00.212 --> 00:12:01.543
Are you teasing me?

138
00:12:01.913 --> 00:12:04.913
Why did you come here if you don't trust me anyway?

139
00:12:04.913 --> 00:12:08.852
Gosh, how come a descendant treat his ancestor...

140
00:12:08.852 --> 00:12:10.352
in such an insolent way?

141
00:12:10.352 --> 00:12:13.283
Are you going to apply acupuncture not giving a cup of tea first?

142
00:12:16.962 --> 00:12:17.962
Thank you.

143
00:12:24.462 --> 00:12:26.832
You seem to be near my age.

144
00:12:27.202 --> 00:12:30.903
Since when have you been good...

145
00:12:31.102 --> 00:12:32.803
at applying acupuncture?

146
00:12:32.803 --> 00:12:33.812
Well,

147
00:12:34.413 --> 00:12:35.773
I have been good at it since when I started it.

148
00:12:39.913 --> 00:12:41.712
Kidding. I do not know since when.

149
00:12:42.712 --> 00:12:45.523
I have treated so many patients since I became a doctor.

150
00:12:45.982 --> 00:12:47.153
I do not know when.

151
00:12:48.492 --> 00:12:50.862
How many could you have treated at your age?

152
00:12:51.822 --> 00:12:53.123
How many have you treated?

153
00:12:54.832 --> 00:12:58.062
Dozens a day, sometimes over 100, for 10 years.

154
00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:02.373
Dozens? 100 patients...

155
00:13:03.433 --> 00:13:06.403
Gosh. I cannot believe that old man.

156
00:13:06.773 --> 00:13:08.742
He should have told me earlier.

157
00:13:09.472 --> 00:13:13.612
You don't have fingerprints on your thumb and index finger because...

158
00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:19.153
You cannot get anything for free, right?

159
00:13:19.753 --> 00:13:21.623
You show yourself off so much.

160
00:13:27.492 --> 00:13:30.163
Jae Ha, you have a good heart as a doctor.

161
00:13:30.862 --> 00:13:32.033
I am sure you will do well.

162
00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.072
What's going on here?

163
00:13:35.933 --> 00:13:37.572
- It can't be. - Well...

164
00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:40.742
Do not be so happy about it.

165
00:13:41.873 --> 00:13:44.413
What about Yeon Kyung, then?

166
00:13:46.582 --> 00:13:48.653
I hope you can treat her politely...

167
00:13:50.183 --> 00:13:52.023
from now on, Jae Ha.

168
00:13:55.623 --> 00:13:57.523
Next to me, you are the one...

169
00:13:58.362 --> 00:14:00.362
who worry about her, as a younger brother does to his sister.

170
00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:02.192
Younger brother, I mean.

171
00:14:04.633 --> 00:14:07.273
Are you here to ask me to care for Yeon Kyung?

172
00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:10.342
I have one more favor to ask you.

173
00:14:52.383 --> 00:14:54.183
Yeon Kyung.

174
00:14:56.712 --> 00:14:57.923
Grandpa.

175
00:15:01.352 --> 00:15:03.423
Can I go with him?

176
00:15:05.962 --> 00:15:08.232
I want to be with him.

177
00:15:10.962 --> 00:15:12.133
Oh, my.

178
00:15:16.003 --> 00:15:18.643
I cannot do anything without him now.

179
00:15:21.013 --> 00:15:22.812
Grandpa, please.

180
00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:27.253
Let me go with him, please.

181
00:15:29.383 --> 00:15:31.822
I want to go with him.

182
00:15:44.562 --> 00:15:47.072
I want to go, Grandpa.

183
00:15:48.273 --> 00:15:51.503
I want to go with him. I don't care.

184
00:15:51.572 --> 00:15:53.303
I want to go.

185
00:15:54.442 --> 00:15:55.543
Grandpa.

186
00:15:56.673 --> 00:15:59.383
Grandpa, let me go with him.

187
00:16:01.783 --> 00:16:02.783
Okay.

188
00:16:07.992 --> 00:16:10.192
Sorry, Grandpa.

189
00:17:36.212 --> 00:17:38.113
I will forget these tears.

190
00:17:39.643 --> 00:17:41.153
Only your smile,

191
00:17:43.252 --> 00:17:45.383
that I will take with me. Only your smile.

192
00:17:49.353 --> 00:17:51.623
If you give me what I cannot take there,

193
00:17:53.192 --> 00:17:55.192
there is not enough space...

194
00:17:56.933 --> 00:17:59.202
for what I really should take with me.

195
00:18:13.212 --> 00:18:15.212
Your hand that held a scalpel.

196
00:18:17.823 --> 00:18:20.022
You in a lab coat.

197
00:18:21.123 --> 00:18:23.153
Your heart towards your patients.

198
00:18:23.992 --> 00:18:25.762
Those are things I will take with me.

199
00:18:35.302 --> 00:18:37.202
Just remember this.

200
00:18:38.143 --> 00:18:39.343
My heart that beats...

201
00:18:40.942 --> 00:18:42.573
because of you.

202
00:20:26.242 --> 00:20:27.613
If you have nowhere to go,

203
00:20:28.452 --> 00:20:29.752
you can stay a little longer.

204
00:20:30.623 --> 00:20:33.022
The rain sounds very nice today.

205
00:21:03.212 --> 00:21:04.683
I promised you...

206
00:21:05.052 --> 00:21:08.522
that I would never leave you alone.

207
00:21:45.192 --> 00:21:48.462
I made tea by boiling down green tea, kudzu flower, and arrowroot.

208
00:21:48.663 --> 00:21:50.403
Take it every morning and evening.

209
00:21:50.462 --> 00:21:51.532
What?

210
00:21:51.702 --> 00:21:52.833
Is it for me?

211
00:21:54.472 --> 00:21:56.502
- I will. - In my opinion,

212
00:21:56.502 --> 00:21:58.502
rather than that Cheol Soo guy whom I have never met,

213
00:21:59.573 --> 00:22:01.343
this idiot here is a much better man.

214
00:22:03.272 --> 00:22:04.313
Jae Sook.

215
00:22:05.212 --> 00:22:06.512
Don't call me an idiot.

216
00:22:09.212 --> 00:22:11.423
And I know it is shameless of me to ask you for this favor,

217
00:22:13.183 --> 00:22:14.522
but please look after...

218
00:22:15.423 --> 00:22:16.923
Ms. Kkot Bun and Bong Sik once in a while.

219
00:22:17.823 --> 00:22:19.663
Sure, I'll do that.

220
00:22:21.292 --> 00:22:23.192
What should I do this this fool?

221
00:22:23.863 --> 00:22:25.633
I know what is trendy nowadays,

222
00:22:26.502 --> 00:22:28.272
but girls these days prefer straightforward men.

223
00:22:28.272 --> 00:22:29.673
Straightforward men...

224
00:22:31.442 --> 00:22:32.802
What does that mean?

225
00:22:35.712 --> 00:22:36.742
What?

226
00:22:38.113 --> 00:22:41.512
Thank you so much for everything.

227
00:23:14.083 --> 00:23:16.813
- Master. - Just bowing is enough.

228
00:23:17.853 --> 00:23:19.123
You don't need to say a long goodbye.

229
00:23:19.923 --> 00:23:21.593
It's tiring.

230
00:23:22.423 --> 00:23:25.323
Go on. She must be waiting for you.

231
00:23:27.363 --> 00:23:30.202
Please be healthy.

232
00:23:32.232 --> 00:23:33.433
Don't worry.

233
00:23:34.272 --> 00:23:38.542
I'll stay by Yeon Kyung's side for a long, long time.

234
00:23:42.313 --> 00:23:43.442
Then, goodbye.

235
00:24:03.663 --> 00:24:06.002
I feel so bad even though we said goodbye to each other.

236
00:24:06.002 --> 00:24:09.333
Why do you feel so bad? I bet he'll come here again soon.

237
00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:10.873
"Come hither." Like this.

238
00:24:12.173 --> 00:24:15.042
Where on earth is he going by the way?

239
00:24:15.113 --> 00:24:16.613
Without any needles too.

240
00:24:16.772 --> 00:24:19.413
Seeing how he's dressed up, Joseon perhaps?

241
00:24:20.452 --> 00:24:22.353
This isn't a time to joke around.

242
00:24:22.883 --> 00:24:24.222
I wasn't joking around.

243
00:25:16.002 --> 00:25:19.403
Around this season, cold and dry air...

244
00:25:21.242 --> 00:25:22.772
could damage your lungs.

245
00:25:26.643 --> 00:25:28.583
So make sure to keep yourself warm.

246
00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:33.653
It must be colder in winter there.

247
00:25:36.552 --> 00:25:38.762
Thank you for joining me...

248
00:25:41.032 --> 00:25:42.192
in this strange destiny.

249
00:25:48.933 --> 00:25:50.103
Now,

250
00:25:52.002 --> 00:25:53.813
you won't be hurt anymore.

251
00:26:01.853 --> 00:26:03.722
I am sorry I could not keep my promise.

252
00:26:11.292 --> 00:26:12.363
Now,

253
00:26:14.992 --> 00:26:16.863
I won't be waiting for you.

254
00:26:58.673 --> 00:26:59.873
Goodbye.

255
00:27:29.603 --> 00:27:31.173
You'll be lonely alone.

256
00:27:35.972 --> 00:27:37.343
I'll be with you.

257
00:32:59.202 --> 00:33:01.232
I will save you.

258
00:33:22.123 --> 00:33:23.923
My world where I left...

259
00:33:24.823 --> 00:33:25.923
you by yourself.

260
00:33:26.563 --> 00:33:27.792
Doctor Heo.

261
00:33:29.692 --> 00:33:30.962
It is a bullet wound patient.

262
00:33:43.982 --> 00:33:45.482
This land has become...

263
00:33:46.242 --> 00:33:48.052
a land full of...

264
00:33:48.552 --> 00:33:51.022
death, pain, and screams everywhere.

265
00:33:51.022 --> 00:33:52.183
Wake up.

266
00:33:52.252 --> 00:33:53.282
Hey.

267
00:33:53.952 --> 00:33:55.923
There are more lives that I am not able to save...

268
00:33:57.222 --> 00:33:59.423
than the ones that I can.

269
00:34:08.632 --> 00:34:10.543
I am facing their death and pain...

270
00:34:11.402 --> 00:34:15.072
like it is my fate.

271
00:34:28.123 --> 00:34:29.952
I am weak...

272
00:34:30.463 --> 00:34:32.722
in front of war.

273
00:34:36.963 --> 00:34:39.233
I cannot stop this journey...

274
00:34:39.233 --> 00:34:41.003
because there are people...

275
00:34:43.003 --> 00:34:44.643
who do not give up...

276
00:34:45.943 --> 00:34:47.713
and wait for me.

277
00:34:55.813 --> 00:34:58.822
When I lose a patient and cannot even cry,

278
00:34:58.882 --> 00:35:00.123
I think about it.

279
00:35:04.193 --> 00:35:06.362
Could we save more patients...

280
00:35:09.793 --> 00:35:12.402
with the medical technology from your world?

281
00:35:18.773 --> 00:35:19.943
What kind of patient is this?

282
00:35:19.972 --> 00:35:22.643
A traffic accident patient. He drove the steering wheel to his chest.

283
00:35:22.643 --> 00:35:24.282
- What about his blood pressure? - 70 and 80.

284
00:35:24.282 --> 00:35:25.612
His pulse is 130.

285
00:35:25.913 --> 00:35:27.583
I think there's blood pooled in his heart.

286
00:35:27.583 --> 00:35:29.253
We'll go to the operation room right away. Move him.

287
00:35:38.523 --> 00:35:39.762
No.

288
00:35:47.302 --> 00:35:48.532
Patient Lee Jae Woong...

289
00:35:50.003 --> 00:35:51.842
died...

290
00:35:55.572 --> 00:35:57.183
on October 1, 2017,

291
00:35:58.143 --> 00:35:59.512
15:31pm.

292
00:35:59.583 --> 00:36:02.853
There are still a lot of lives we can't save...

293
00:36:02.983 --> 00:36:06.382
at this place where medical technology has made great progress.

294
00:36:06.382 --> 00:36:08.293
Please clench your fist.

295
00:36:13.293 --> 00:36:16.933
Sometimes, unexplainable miracles happen.

296
00:36:23.543 --> 00:36:24.672
Thank you.

297
00:36:25.302 --> 00:36:26.802
However, I know...

298
00:36:28.373 --> 00:36:30.342
that those aren't miracles.

299
00:36:33.413 --> 00:36:35.083
Please give her some pain relievers.

300
00:36:43.123 --> 00:36:44.623
As you said,

301
00:36:45.793 --> 00:36:47.262
life and death...

302
00:36:47.793 --> 00:36:49.463
are predestined.

303
00:36:49.463 --> 00:36:50.463
It's an emergency patient.

304
00:36:50.463 --> 00:36:52.503
- We need to go. - It's an emergency.

305
00:36:52.503 --> 00:36:54.333
Doctors are doing their best...

306
00:36:55.003 --> 00:36:56.632
every day...

307
00:36:57.402 --> 00:36:59.472
to prevent a single death...

308
00:37:00.143 --> 00:37:02.273
in the middle of life or death.

309
00:37:40.143 --> 00:37:41.913
Are you crying today...

310
00:37:43.253 --> 00:37:44.853
in your world...

311
00:37:47.722 --> 00:37:49.893
because you lost...

312
00:37:49.893 --> 00:37:51.663
someone you must have saved?

313
00:38:01.572 --> 00:38:03.132
How many deaths...

314
00:38:04.503 --> 00:38:06.103
have you faced today...

315
00:38:06.543 --> 00:38:09.273
in your world?

316
00:38:15.612 --> 00:38:16.713
Are you...

317
00:38:19.552 --> 00:38:20.652
Are you...

318
00:38:23.992 --> 00:38:25.722
doing okay?

319
00:38:32.032 --> 00:38:33.362
Are you okay?

320
00:38:54.677 --> 00:38:57.278
Doctor Heo. You are here.

321
00:38:57.378 --> 00:38:59.577
Thank you for coming.

322
00:38:59.847 --> 00:39:01.077
Where is the patient?

323
00:39:01.747 --> 00:39:03.117
Here.

324
00:39:19.468 --> 00:39:20.497
Mom.

325
00:39:20.597 --> 00:39:21.668
Doctor.

326
00:39:21.697 --> 00:39:24.867
Boil some honeysuckle and licorice in water.

327
00:39:25.037 --> 00:39:26.867
Make her drink that frequently.

328
00:39:26.867 --> 00:39:29.977
Thank you so much.

329
00:39:30.108 --> 00:39:32.347
Will she live now?

330
00:39:32.347 --> 00:39:34.847
Yes, do not worry.

331
00:39:34.847 --> 00:39:36.477
She will get better.

332
00:39:38.947 --> 00:39:40.318
Thank you.

333
00:39:40.318 --> 00:39:41.787
- Thank you. - You are welcome.

334
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.232

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

335
00:40:22.197 --> 00:40:24.597
He got sick while he evacuated.

336
00:40:24.867 --> 00:40:27.537
He could not get treated because there was no doctor there.

337
00:40:27.968 --> 00:40:30.738
It seems like he will not last for a few days.

338
00:40:31.608 --> 00:40:33.677
Who is it?

339
00:40:33.677 --> 00:40:36.537
He is Heo Im from Haeminseo.

340
00:40:36.637 --> 00:40:40.617
Heo Im, you punk.

341
00:40:41.278 --> 00:40:42.278
I regret...

342
00:40:42.617 --> 00:40:47.017
not killing you...

343
00:40:48.517 --> 00:40:51.628
before I die.

344
00:40:54.327 --> 00:40:55.898
I came to treat you...

345
00:40:56.497 --> 00:40:58.128
because I heard you were ill.

346
00:41:00.537 --> 00:41:01.898
How dare you...

347
00:41:02.197 --> 00:41:04.068
May I read your pulse for a second?

348
00:41:04.338 --> 00:41:06.708
Do you think I am not aware...

349
00:41:07.637 --> 00:41:09.438
of your scheme?

350
00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:14.117
I am sure you are here to humiliate me all you want...

351
00:41:15.718 --> 00:41:19.617
and take revenge for what I have done to you.

352
00:41:21.057 --> 00:41:22.218
What?

353
00:41:24.128 --> 00:41:27.327
Do you feel so satisfied to see me...

354
00:41:29.258 --> 00:41:30.997
dying like this?

355
00:41:31.867 --> 00:41:33.367
I will leave you if you do not want me...

356
00:41:34.168 --> 00:41:35.338
to read your pulse.

357
00:41:38.438 --> 00:41:42.278
You cannot just leave like this.

358
00:41:45.048 --> 00:41:46.247
Please...

359
00:41:48.218 --> 00:41:50.718
Please save me.

360
00:42:02.758 --> 00:42:04.497
Please save him.

361
00:42:05.327 --> 00:42:08.338
Please show mercy.

362
00:42:14.008 --> 00:42:17.378
Then I shall take a look.

363
00:42:32.128 --> 00:42:36.327
It is malignant tumors. They already have spread everywhere in his body.

364
00:42:37.497 --> 00:42:38.767
It is too late.

365
00:42:44.367 --> 00:42:45.608
Doctor.

366
00:42:45.708 --> 00:42:47.938
She would not have survived even if you applied acupuncture.

367
00:42:48.177 --> 00:42:50.407
But I at least wanted to make my mother feel better.

368
00:43:00.718 --> 00:43:02.318
What I can do now...

369
00:43:02.818 --> 00:43:05.028
is to reduce his pain.

370
00:43:10.398 --> 00:43:11.528
Do not worry.

371
00:43:12.068 --> 00:43:16.168
You are only a patient who needs a doctor's treatment.

372
00:44:01.378 --> 00:44:02.517
All right.

373
00:44:03.918 --> 00:44:06.747
I should visit the slave, Sam Wol's house next. Where is the place?

374
00:44:10.088 --> 00:44:11.287
It must be this way.

(Shinhae Hospital)

376
00:44:16.927 --> 00:44:19.128
I said I don't want it.

377
00:44:19.197 --> 00:44:21.798
I told you so many times already. Take it away from me.

378
00:44:21.798 --> 00:44:24.168
What's wrong with you again?

379
00:44:26.037 --> 00:44:27.508
- Min Jae. - Yes?

380
00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:31.177
Oh, right. I forgot that you're an assistant doctor. Sorry.

381
00:44:32.108 --> 00:44:33.847
- Soo Ho. - Yes?

382
00:44:34.418 --> 00:44:37.747
Call the cafeteria and tell them to do a better job in preparing meals.

383
00:44:37.847 --> 00:44:42.787
How could they provide greasy food to a patient with a heart disease?

384
00:44:42.787 --> 00:44:43.827
Yes, ma'am.

385
00:44:43.827 --> 00:44:46.327
Tell them to give her some light meat,

386
00:44:46.327 --> 00:44:48.958
- fish, and vegetables. - Okay.

387
00:44:49.557 --> 00:44:53.528
They better give only tasty food since she's a picky eater.

388
00:44:54.938 --> 00:44:56.838
This place needs to be cleaned again too.

389
00:44:58.468 --> 00:45:00.278
Don't you know we must keep the wards clean?

390
00:45:00.508 --> 00:45:01.677
Do a better job.

391
00:45:01.838 --> 00:45:03.008
Sorry.

392
00:45:05.077 --> 00:45:06.148
Bye.

393
00:45:13.918 --> 00:45:15.157
What a teenager.

394
00:45:34.307 --> 00:45:37.278
You have a surgery coming up soon. Where are you going at this hour?

395
00:45:37.278 --> 00:45:39.048
It's none of your business.

396
00:45:39.148 --> 00:45:41.148
What? Are you going to stop me?

397
00:45:41.148 --> 00:45:43.548
No, why would I do that?

398
00:45:46.387 --> 00:45:48.017
I'm going to go with you.

399
00:45:48.017 --> 00:45:49.258
I...

400
00:45:50.287 --> 00:45:51.557
have a car too.

401
00:45:55.358 --> 00:45:58.668
Wear your holter monitor first before then.

402
00:45:59.168 --> 00:46:02.738
I've got everything you need here...

403
00:46:03.267 --> 00:46:05.108

(Opening of the Child Cardiology Center in Shinhae Hospital)

405

Gosh, Dr. Choi.

406
00:46:29.128 --> 00:46:30.927
It's been such a long time.

407
00:46:31.798 --> 00:46:33.528
I heard you got your doctor's degree recently.

408
00:46:33.528 --> 00:46:35.398
That's impressive to achieve in your age.

409
00:46:36.267 --> 00:46:37.807
I still have a lot to learn.

410
00:46:37.807 --> 00:46:42.077
You're a skilled doctor and your theses are outstanding.

411
00:46:42.077 --> 00:46:45.307
You'll be an assistant and associate professor in the near future.

412
00:46:45.307 --> 00:46:47.077
- Don't you think so? - Of course.

413

She's an indispensable doctor in our hospital.

414

Ha Ra's mother donated a huge amount of money...

415

in respect for our Dr. Choi.

416

I don't know how I should...

417
00:46:59.358 --> 00:47:01.128
repay your kindness.

418
00:47:02.458 --> 00:47:05.997
Why is that my kindness to you?

419
00:47:06.898 --> 00:47:07.968
What?

420
00:47:09.938 --> 00:47:11.838
It's not for you,

421
00:47:11.907 --> 00:47:14.708
but for sick children like Ha Ra.

422
00:47:15.807 --> 00:47:18.648
Right. You're right about that.

423
00:47:20.048 --> 00:47:22.718
Please work hard so that there aren't any children...

424
00:47:23.517 --> 00:47:25.287
who can't get treated due to lack of money.

425
00:47:26.387 --> 00:47:27.818
- Sure. - Please do so, Dr. Han.

426
00:47:27.818 --> 00:47:30.227
Sure.

427

That's the message from Ha Ra's mother.

428

On Ha Ra's death anniversary not long ago.

430
00:47:41.438 --> 00:47:44.668
Then please excuse me now that I delivered her message.

437
00:48:13.528 --> 00:48:14.637
What?

438
00:48:15.197 --> 00:48:16.907
Are you jealous because I got my Ph.D before you?

439
00:48:16.907 --> 00:48:18.267
No, no, no.

440
00:48:18.367 --> 00:48:22.378
I'll just live this way if I have to work as hard as you to get it.

441
00:48:22.378 --> 00:48:24.508
- What? - You operate on patients every day.

442
00:48:24.508 --> 00:48:25.977
That's not living, you see.

443
00:48:26.077 --> 00:48:30.347
A doctor is nothing without patients and operations.

444
00:48:33.488 --> 00:48:35.318
You think you're the only doctor, don't you?

445
00:48:35.418 --> 00:48:38.427
This is serious. You will never be able to fix this mental disease.

Gosh, that arrogant punk is here again.

449
00:48:52.907 --> 00:48:55.508
Why do I feel so down every time I see him?

450
00:48:55.708 --> 00:48:58.077
He bought only two cups of coffee too.

451
00:48:58.407 --> 00:49:01.148
- Do you feel down? - Maybe it's because of his height.

452
00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:03.378
Then...

453
00:49:04.617 --> 00:49:05.818
eat this.

454
00:49:06.548 --> 00:49:07.657

455
00:49:10.988 --> 00:49:14.298
Hey. Do you think I'm still a child?

456
00:49:14.798 --> 00:49:16.628
My goodness. I'm going back.

457
00:49:18.028 --> 00:49:20.338
What is this? Is it a wedding invitation?

458
00:49:20.838 --> 00:49:22.068
It's next month.

459
00:49:23.068 --> 00:49:26.108
He came to Seoul Station last week and handed the invitations out.

460

finally having a daughter-in-law.

462
00:49:32.347 --> 00:49:34.218
He got back together with his son a year ago...

463
00:49:34.818 --> 00:49:36.718
and started to work as a security guard.

464
00:49:36.747 --> 00:49:39.117
He bragged so much about how he paid for...

465
00:49:39.218 --> 00:49:41.718
his son's wedding with the money he saved up.

466
00:49:42.918 --> 00:49:44.157
I see.

467
00:49:45.657 --> 00:49:46.958
I'm glad to hear that.

468
00:49:47.358 --> 00:49:49.657
The other guys...

469
00:49:49.997 --> 00:49:53.028
planned up a schedule to wash their clothes...

470
00:49:53.028 --> 00:49:55.898
and go to a sauna before the wedding day.

471
00:50:03.907 --> 00:50:06.577
Why are you looking at me like that?

472
00:50:06.747 --> 00:50:08.048
It's just...

473
00:50:09.718 --> 00:50:11.048
I'm just proud of you.

474
00:50:14.418 --> 00:50:16.258
I'm sure you're busy as is.

475
00:50:17.488 --> 00:50:19.588
But I heard from Grandpa...

476
00:50:19.787 --> 00:50:21.657
that you visit them...

477
00:50:22.758 --> 00:50:24.227
once every two weeks regularly.

478
00:50:25.697 --> 00:50:28.968
I'm not going there because Heo Im asked me to.

479
00:50:29.597 --> 00:50:31.367
- What? - I mean...

480
00:50:32.668 --> 00:50:35.807
I did go there because he asked me to at first.

481
00:50:36.947 --> 00:50:38.447
Now, I like going there.

482
00:50:39.508 --> 00:50:40.918
It's out of my own will.

483
00:50:41.617 --> 00:50:42.918
I know.

484
00:50:45.947 --> 00:50:47.787
My skills improved a lot too.

485
00:50:47.887 --> 00:50:49.557
I want to show him,

486
00:50:51.358 --> 00:50:52.787
but I can't.

487
00:50:52.927 --> 00:50:54.298
I know.

488
00:50:54.927 --> 00:50:57.097
He'd be so happy if he found it out.

489
00:51:00.668 --> 00:51:02.238
And we could go to the wedding together.

490
00:51:26.088 --> 00:51:28.997
Gosh, are you going to stab my flesh with that?

491
00:51:28.997 --> 00:51:30.298
Yes.

492
00:51:30.298 --> 00:51:33.298
You cannot possibly hurt my body that my parents have given me.

493
00:51:33.298 --> 00:51:35.197
It has already been hurt.

494
00:51:35.197 --> 00:51:38.767
It would be better for you to keep your life this way.

495
00:51:38.767 --> 00:51:40.977
- Face the front. - But still...

496
00:51:40.977 --> 00:51:42.037
Let me see.

497
00:51:43.407 --> 00:51:45.708
It is going in.

498
00:51:48.747 --> 00:51:50.177
Superintendent.

499
00:51:50.918 --> 00:51:53.347
Superintendent. Superintendent Heo.

500
00:51:54.958 --> 00:51:56.157
Let us stop here.

501
00:51:56.927 --> 00:51:59.188
Mak Gae, Mak Gae.

502
00:51:59.188 --> 00:52:02.758
Did I not tell you to stop calling me like that?

503
00:52:07.637 --> 00:52:08.637
Oh, my.

504
00:52:11.367 --> 00:52:12.767
You are Sayaga.

505
00:52:12.767 --> 00:52:16.077
Thank you for remembering who I am. But...

506
00:52:16.208 --> 00:52:18.577
please forget that name.

507
00:52:19.378 --> 00:52:20.418
I am...

508
00:52:21.048 --> 00:52:22.378
Kim Cheon Sung.

509
00:52:29.557 --> 00:52:31.427
Do you remember me?

510
00:52:37.028 --> 00:52:39.867
I didn't even thank you then.

511
00:52:40.338 --> 00:52:42.798
Thank you for saving my life.

512
00:52:46.367 --> 00:52:49.977
Welcome... Welcome...

513
00:52:54.617 --> 00:52:57.988
I heard that a general had become Korean with his soldiers,

514
00:52:57.988 --> 00:52:59.517
but I did not know that it was you.

515
00:52:59.517 --> 00:53:00.787
I had also...

516
00:53:01.517 --> 00:53:04.528
heard that there was a doctor who went into the battlefield...

517
00:53:04.927 --> 00:53:07.097
and saved a lot of people.

518
00:53:07.628 --> 00:53:08.898
That was you.

519
00:53:11.597 --> 00:53:14.537
How did we end up on the same side?

520
00:53:16.398 --> 00:53:18.838
We just chose the life...

521
00:53:19.068 --> 00:53:20.907
that fit us the most.

522
00:53:22.677 --> 00:53:25.177
And my life was given to me again...

523
00:53:25.177 --> 00:53:27.918
so that I could live for you.

524
00:53:34.258 --> 00:53:37.327
Is the woman you were with doing well?

525
00:53:41.898 --> 00:53:43.398
I think so.

526
00:53:43.398 --> 00:53:44.468
Are you...

527
00:53:45.367 --> 00:53:47.068
not with her now?

528
00:53:49.767 --> 00:53:52.108
She went back to where she belongs.

529
00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:57.177
You two...

530
00:53:58.847 --> 00:54:00.318
were beautiful together.

531
00:54:04.947 --> 00:54:06.387
Were we?

532
00:54:06.387 --> 00:54:07.488
If you...

533
00:54:09.117 --> 00:54:10.588
meet her again,

534
00:54:11.088 --> 00:54:13.927
you need to tell her...

535
00:54:15.597 --> 00:54:17.367
how your life changed...

536
00:54:17.898 --> 00:54:21.037
after you met her.

537
00:54:24.508 --> 00:54:26.867
She would know already.

538
00:54:57.767 --> 00:55:00.208
- What is this? - You startled me.

539
00:55:00.907 --> 00:55:02.577
Gosh.

540
00:55:03.177 --> 00:55:05.177
Did you come in through the back door?

541
00:55:05.778 --> 00:55:08.278
It is so pretty. I have never seen that before.

542
00:55:08.548 --> 00:55:09.617
Is it?

543
00:55:10.818 --> 00:55:13.387
It is called a heart.

544
00:55:13.617 --> 00:55:16.057
It has two meanings.

545
00:55:16.117 --> 00:55:17.458
One indicates your organ,

546
00:55:17.458 --> 00:55:19.758
and the other your feelings when you like others.

547
00:55:21.128 --> 00:55:24.028
A girl that looked just like you told me this.

548
00:55:25.028 --> 00:55:26.898
- Mister. - Yes?

549
00:55:26.898 --> 00:55:29.568
When can I start learning about medicine?

550
00:55:29.568 --> 00:55:30.767
Medicine?

551
00:55:32.438 --> 00:55:35.878
When you grow up after some time,

552
00:55:36.378 --> 00:55:37.508
and you grow older...

553
00:55:37.508 --> 00:55:38.677
Mister!

554
00:55:38.677 --> 00:55:40.977
Gosh, an adult is talking to you.

555
00:55:43.017 --> 00:55:44.088
Oh, my.

556
00:55:44.548 --> 00:55:46.548
I was the one that saved her,

557
00:55:46.688 --> 00:55:48.557
and yet, she does not even hug me.

558
00:55:48.557 --> 00:55:52.258
Oh, my. Yeon Yi, you are here.

559
00:55:52.258 --> 00:55:54.458
Yes, I have come here to look at herb medicine.

560
00:55:54.458 --> 00:55:56.927
You will become a great doctor in the future.

561
00:55:56.927 --> 00:56:01.468
Yes, I will become a better doctor than Dr. Heo.

562
00:56:01.468 --> 00:56:02.867
Gosh, Yeon Yi.

563
00:56:03.137 --> 00:56:04.738
You do not know who I am.

564
00:56:05.168 --> 00:56:08.738
We do. You are the superintendent who have been in Haeminseo...

565
00:56:08.738 --> 00:56:10.378
for 10 years.

566
00:56:11.807 --> 00:56:13.648
There is someone to blame for that.

567
00:56:13.648 --> 00:56:15.117
Is that me?

568
00:56:17.017 --> 00:56:19.117
Why did you come here?

569
00:56:19.418 --> 00:56:22.117
You are a busy doctor that looks after the King in the palace.

570
00:56:22.117 --> 00:56:23.927
That is why I came here.

571
00:56:29.157 --> 00:56:33.097
The ringing in the King's ears does not seem to be getting better.

572
00:56:33.267 --> 00:56:36.238
The King offered to receive acupuncture,

573
00:56:37.137 --> 00:56:38.708
so I recommended you.

574
00:56:41.477 --> 00:56:43.307
Did I make the wrong choice?

575
00:56:45.108 --> 00:56:48.378
It is for you to decide. Why are you glaring at me?

576
00:57:14.708 --> 00:57:15.938
Dr. Heo!

577
00:57:16.577 --> 00:57:17.807
Dr. Heo!

578
00:57:18.807 --> 00:57:20.818
Please save my son!

579
00:57:20.847 --> 00:57:22.947
He was butted by a cow.

580
00:57:23.548 --> 00:57:26.218
Dr. Heo, please save him.

581
00:57:26.218 --> 00:57:29.318
No, he has to go to the palace right now.

582
00:57:29.318 --> 00:57:31.057
You should go to another doctor.

583
00:57:31.057 --> 00:57:33.128
No, I cannot.

584
00:57:33.128 --> 00:57:36.227
If it is not Dr. Heo, my son will die.

585
00:57:37.727 --> 00:57:40.898
It looks as if he will soon be dead.

586
00:57:42.037 --> 00:57:43.097
Let us go.

587
00:57:43.097 --> 00:57:44.708
Move him into the room.

588
00:57:45.668 --> 00:57:48.137
And bring some water, needles,

589
00:57:48.137 --> 00:57:49.838
and the seed of morus bark.

590
00:57:50.008 --> 00:57:51.447
Yes, master. Follow me.

591
00:57:51.447 --> 00:57:52.447
Thank you.

592
00:57:53.008 --> 00:57:54.278
What are you doing?

593
00:57:55.177 --> 00:57:56.247
Dr. Heo,

594
00:57:57.387 --> 00:57:59.887
are you going to make the King wait?

595
00:57:59.887 --> 00:58:02.258
Please tell him that there is a patient in danger...

596
00:58:02.258 --> 00:58:04.657
- and that he needs to wait. - What?

597
00:58:05.028 --> 00:58:06.028
Hey.

598
00:58:06.787 --> 00:58:08.958
Hey, are you out of your mind?

599
00:58:09.028 --> 00:58:10.798
How dare you do that to his Majesty?

600
00:58:11.468 --> 00:58:13.367
You will need to take responsibility for this.

601
00:58:16.168 --> 00:58:17.938
He is His Majesty's people.

602
00:58:18.838 --> 00:58:21.977
He is someone that His Majesty needs to protect and look after.

603
00:58:23.878 --> 00:58:26.608
If you stop me and let the boy die,

604
00:58:27.177 --> 00:58:29.677
will you be able to take care of the angry people?

605
00:58:35.358 --> 00:58:38.258
Gosh, how can this be?

606
00:58:38.488 --> 00:58:39.557
Oh, my.

607
00:58:42.097 --> 00:58:43.358
Oh, my.

608
00:58:45.597 --> 00:58:47.568
Fortunately, his organs have not been hurt,

609
00:58:47.838 --> 00:58:50.097
but the stab wounds could be dangerous for him.

610
00:58:51.208 --> 00:58:52.637
I need to stitch them up.

611
00:58:52.637 --> 00:58:53.637
Really?

612
00:58:54.077 --> 00:58:56.537
Stitch them up? How?

613
00:58:56.537 --> 00:58:57.878
For the wounds to heal faster,

614
00:58:57.878 --> 00:58:59.708
we need to stitch the wounds up.

615
00:58:59.708 --> 00:59:01.947
What? The flesh?

616
00:59:01.947 --> 00:59:04.418
Oh, my.

617
00:59:16.057 --> 00:59:17.168
Oh, my.

618
00:59:27.307 --> 00:59:28.378
Oh, my.

619
01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:02.537
Gosh, you scum.

620
01:00:02.677 --> 01:00:04.878
How dare you make His Majesty wait?

621
01:00:05.508 --> 01:00:07.617
We forgave your sins because of what you have done...

622
01:00:07.617 --> 01:00:09.517
during the war.

623
01:00:09.718 --> 01:00:11.548
But have you still not come to your senses?

624
01:00:14.387 --> 01:00:15.858
Gosh.

625
01:00:15.858 --> 01:00:18.227
Ask for forgiveness to His Majesty.

626
01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:24.898
So did you save...

627
01:00:25.697 --> 01:00:27.097
the child?

628
01:00:28.597 --> 01:00:30.468
Thanks to your grace,

629
01:00:31.508 --> 01:00:33.338
he is alive.

630
01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:34.838
Then it is enough.

631
01:00:36.477 --> 01:00:38.577
We shall not mention it any longer.

632
01:00:41.617 --> 01:00:45.287
I have heard of your abilities as a doctor,

633
01:00:45.387 --> 01:00:49.588
but this is something that my doctors could not treat.

634
01:00:50.688 --> 01:00:53.597
And how would I be able to trust you...

635
01:00:54.097 --> 01:00:55.697
after what you did to me last time?

636
01:00:55.697 --> 01:00:56.758
Your Majesty,

637
01:00:58.128 --> 01:01:00.838
I do not know well about acupuncture.

638
01:01:01.537 --> 01:01:03.267
But Heo Im's treatments...

639
01:01:03.267 --> 01:01:05.668
are different from other doctors.

640
01:01:05.767 --> 01:01:07.137
Also, he saved...

641
01:01:07.137 --> 01:01:10.307
many patients with his unique acupuncture technique...

642
01:01:10.577 --> 01:01:13.378
that is different from other doctors.

643
01:01:14.447 --> 01:01:15.947
Please trust him.

644
01:01:23.188 --> 01:01:26.287
Start your treatment.

645
01:01:39.637 --> 01:01:43.537
Did you not hear that the king ran away early in the morning?

646
01:01:43.648 --> 01:01:45.708
The angry people...

647
01:01:45.708 --> 01:01:48.318
are setting everything on fire.

648
01:01:49.017 --> 01:01:52.218
- He deserves to be torn to pieces. - How could he run away?

649
01:02:06.697 --> 01:02:09.838
What are you doing? Start your treatment.

650
01:02:21.707 --> 01:02:23.008
Ringing in the ears...

651
01:02:23.508 --> 01:02:25.877
is a very painful illness...

652
01:02:26.537 --> 01:02:30.178
because only you know the pain and other people do not know it.

653
01:02:31.377 --> 01:02:34.988
Because of that, it is also called the crying of the heart.

654
01:02:41.287 --> 01:02:43.798
I hope that the crying of your heart...

655
01:02:44.627 --> 01:02:46.428
is tears of atonement and console...

656
01:02:46.557 --> 01:02:48.298
for the innocent people who fell down...

657
01:02:49.028 --> 01:02:51.738
because of the war.

658
01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:55.767
I will concentrate on Shaofu and Zhongzhu...

659
01:02:56.368 --> 01:02:58.307
and apply acupuncture on six places to console your heart.

660
01:02:58.707 --> 01:03:01.908
After that, I will stop the wind sounds from your head...

661
01:03:03.077 --> 01:03:05.247
by applying acupuncture in three points behind your neck.

662
01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:42.207
The rumors about you were true.

663
01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:55.827
Heo Im should receive the royal command.

664
01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:04.397
Doctor Heo Im of Haeminseo...

665
01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:08.868
will be appointed to the Royal Infirmary.

666
01:05:08.868 --> 01:05:11.937
Focus on taking care of the health...

667
01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:13.747
of the king and prince.

668
01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:28.258
I was promoted six levels today.

669
01:05:28.588 --> 01:05:30.127
They want me to work at the palace.

670
01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:33.127
Why is your facial expression like that then?

671
01:05:33.897 --> 01:05:36.267
You have been waiting to be successful and work there so much.

672
01:05:36.468 --> 01:05:39.397
They are giving this to me just because I treated a small illness...

673
01:05:39.838 --> 01:05:42.537
of the king, not because I saved the lives of people during the war.

674
01:05:42.537 --> 01:05:45.207
You should be punished.

675
01:05:45.278 --> 01:05:46.477
Just because you treated a small illness of the king?

676
01:05:47.548 --> 01:05:49.147
Why do you not just tell them about this?

677
01:05:51.178 --> 01:05:52.618
Important rewards...

678
01:05:53.577 --> 01:05:55.787
are not given meaningless like that.

679
01:05:57.118 --> 01:06:00.158
Special gifts visiting you...

680
01:06:00.588 --> 01:06:02.588
when you desperately want it.

681
01:06:04.658 --> 01:06:06.627
That is a good reward.

682
01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:08.798
Anyway,

683
01:06:10.397 --> 01:06:13.598
I will catch up with you soon.

684
01:06:14.368 --> 01:06:17.377
I am three levels higher than you.

685
01:06:18.277 --> 01:06:19.938
You do not know yet.

686
01:06:20.447 --> 01:06:23.348
Our descendants regard me higher.

687
01:06:25.277 --> 01:06:26.478
They say...

688
01:06:27.787 --> 01:06:28.917
I am the best.

689
01:06:31.957 --> 01:06:33.688
- I am the top. - Gosh.

690
01:06:34.428 --> 01:06:36.888
You are so outdated.

691
01:06:37.157 --> 01:06:39.858
We say things like, "Awesome. Cool. Thumbs up."

692
01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:42.697
What?

693
01:06:43.098 --> 01:06:45.968
I cannot believe the generation gap.

694
01:06:58.877 --> 01:07:00.077
Did you still have that...

695
01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:03.487
and not eat it?

696
01:07:04.258 --> 01:07:06.117
How could I eat this?

697
01:07:06.588 --> 01:07:09.728
They will know how we live.

698
01:07:10.598 --> 01:07:13.398
But we have no way to find out how they live.

699
01:07:17.268 --> 01:07:19.898
I am curious whether Chun Sool is okay.

700
01:07:39.018 --> 01:07:40.457
Chun Sool?

701
01:07:49.367 --> 01:07:51.598
Why do you want to drink in the middle of the day?

702
01:07:51.598 --> 01:07:52.968
Are you like this these days?

703
01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:55.407
I have a couple of drinks when I'm bored.

704
01:07:56.438 --> 01:07:58.838
I'm not an alcoholic, so don't worry.

705
01:07:58.838 --> 01:08:01.548
I heard you were busy going fishing and going to the mountains.

706
01:08:01.808 --> 01:08:05.317
I'm really busy. I might die because I'm too busy being unemployed.

707
01:08:06.277 --> 01:08:09.117
It's good that you look healthy.

708
01:08:09.117 --> 01:08:10.558
I'm healthy.

709
01:08:11.218 --> 01:08:14.688
Since I gave up my greed and false reputation like you said,

710
01:08:14.688 --> 01:08:16.558
my heart and body are healthier than ever.

711
01:08:17.228 --> 01:08:19.127
You are finally becoming mature.

712
01:08:20.968 --> 01:08:22.997
Since we're talking about it,

713
01:08:24.697 --> 01:08:28.037
can I work here as a doctor and get paid?

714
01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:29.268
What?

715
01:08:29.268 --> 01:08:31.138
You're talking nonsense.

716
01:08:31.178 --> 01:08:34.447
I'm healthy. Why would an old oriental medicine clinic need...

717
01:08:34.678 --> 01:08:36.207
two doctors?

718
01:08:36.207 --> 01:08:38.478
I'll receive only half of the pay. No, I'll work for free.

719
01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.487
When will you start working?

720
01:08:44.188 --> 01:08:46.117
Look at your eyes twinkling.

721
01:08:46.117 --> 01:08:47.957
You just stopped drinking.

722
01:08:49.188 --> 01:08:51.558
I know that my liver isn't mine anymore.

723
01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:54.728
Can't you see that I'm drinking with my eyes since I can't drink?

724
01:08:54.728 --> 01:08:57.567
That's soju, not beer. You can't drink it with your eyes.

725
01:08:57.567 --> 01:08:59.737
If you can't take it anymore, just drink some arrowroot tea...

726
01:08:59.737 --> 01:09:02.707
and kudzu tea. Did you drink your green tea in the morning?

727
01:09:02.707 --> 01:09:05.138
Why are you getting more talkative?

728
01:09:05.138 --> 01:09:07.648
Should I marry you or not?

729
01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:11.018
The wedding invitations are already printed.

730
01:09:11.377 --> 01:09:12.947
I really want to cancel.

731
01:09:20.858 --> 01:09:22.327
- Cut. - Cut.

732
01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:27.098
- Finish it up. - You did a great job.

733
01:09:27.928 --> 01:09:30.167
- Good work. - You're the best.

734
01:09:30.268 --> 01:09:32.768
- You're fast and clean. - Thank you.

735
01:09:33.567 --> 01:09:34.768
Thank you.

736
01:09:39.338 --> 01:09:40.777
Thank you.

737
01:10:11.678 --> 01:10:12.978
If you feel down,

738
01:10:12.978 --> 01:10:15.548
go have fun at a club after a long time.

739
01:10:16.148 --> 01:10:17.148
Gosh.

740
01:10:17.817 --> 01:10:19.848
It's been a while since I last went to a club anyway.

741
01:10:20.148 --> 01:10:21.188
Shall I?

742
01:10:22.688 --> 01:10:23.787
Do you want to join me?

743
01:10:26.888 --> 01:10:27.987
Gosh, my back.

744
01:10:28.987 --> 01:10:30.497
Gosh, my neck.

745
01:10:30.497 --> 01:10:31.858
Do you think I'll be okay?

746
01:10:32.058 --> 01:10:34.067
- No, you shouldn't go. - No, right?

747
01:10:35.127 --> 01:10:36.598
I just can't dance.

748
01:10:39.867 --> 01:10:42.608
Nurse Jung.

749
01:10:42.608 --> 01:10:45.678
What do you do when you miss someone...

750
01:10:47.048 --> 01:10:48.377
so much?

751
01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:51.218
There's nothing much. You just go see them.

752
01:10:54.218 --> 01:10:55.718
You just go see them.

753
01:10:57.188 --> 01:10:58.688
If you can't,

754
01:11:00.627 --> 01:11:02.287
see them from your heart.

755
01:11:43.468 --> 01:11:44.838
Count to 200 before you eat it.

756
01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:50.777
Count to 200.

757
01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:53.808
I shall come back before the end of the count.

758
01:12:00.388 --> 01:12:01.388
One.

759
01:12:02.817 --> 01:12:03.817
Two.

760
01:12:04.957 --> 01:12:05.957
Three.

761
01:12:06.518 --> 01:12:07.588
Four.

762
01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:09.457
Five.

763
01:12:10.558 --> 01:12:11.657
Five.

764
01:12:26.178 --> 01:12:27.178
Here.

765
01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:30.277
I wanted to be someone who makes others' hearts beat.

766
01:12:36.987 --> 01:12:38.487
Press here.

767
01:12:38.588 --> 01:12:41.428
If you press this point whenever your heart feels exhausted,

768
01:12:41.428 --> 01:12:44.228
it will clear and revive your heart.

769
01:13:14.428 --> 01:13:15.888
What is this?

770
01:13:16.188 --> 01:13:18.827
I told you to prepare for next year's medical exam.

771
01:13:19.457 --> 01:13:21.468
Those books will help your studies.

772
01:13:21.468 --> 01:13:22.728
Read them closely.

773
01:13:24.838 --> 01:13:26.438
Goodness.

774
01:13:26.938 --> 01:13:29.438
You should not hate studying so much like this.

775
01:13:30.338 --> 01:13:34.377
Do you think simply picking up the skills is enough to be a doctor?

776
01:13:40.588 --> 01:13:41.848
Mak Gae.

777
01:13:44.058 --> 01:13:47.088
You should not run errands here forever.

778
01:13:49.127 --> 01:13:51.957
About the world that lady lives in.

779
01:13:53.657 --> 01:13:57.938
You heard women can be a doctor there, right?

780
01:14:01.067 --> 01:14:03.037
Yes, that's right.

781
01:14:04.508 --> 01:14:05.678
It must be nice.

782
01:14:14.987 --> 01:14:16.417
Do not think about useless stuff,

783
01:14:16.787 --> 01:14:18.518
and focus on your studies.

784
01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:20.758
Silly brat.

785
01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:24.997
Gosh, I do not want to study.

786
01:14:37.508 --> 01:14:40.848
When will she be able to start living as a woman?

787
01:14:45.178 --> 01:14:47.048
Mak Gae, you brat.

788
01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:51.817
Dr. Heo.

789
01:14:53.117 --> 01:14:55.388
It is getting late at night. Why did you not come tomorrow?

790
01:14:55.388 --> 01:14:58.428
I was worried you might feel hungry...

791
01:14:58.598 --> 01:15:00.197
after working hard until this time.

792
01:15:02.667 --> 01:15:04.567
They should have saved this...

793
01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.737
to feed themselves instead.

794
01:15:07.138 --> 01:15:09.138
Deliver them my gratitude.

795
01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:10.438
Okay, doctor.

796
01:15:13.237 --> 01:15:14.808
Mak Gae.

797
01:15:15.008 --> 01:15:17.447
I told you not to run.

798
01:15:18.777 --> 01:15:21.888
They just love to play around so much.

799
01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:42.968
(Choi Yeon Kyung)

800
01:15:49.277 --> 01:15:52.148
It must hurt a lot. How did you get this?

801
01:15:52.518 --> 01:15:55.018
I heard the whistle and ran away.

802
01:15:55.247 --> 01:15:56.718
Then I fell down on stairs.

803
01:15:56.987 --> 01:15:59.858
Don't forget to watch your step even if you're in a rush.

804
01:16:02.157 --> 01:16:04.957
Always be careful.

805
01:16:04.957 --> 01:16:06.098
Okay.

806
01:16:06.957 --> 01:16:08.567
You saw what I did, right?

807
01:16:08.567 --> 01:16:10.197
I'll give you this,

808
01:16:10.197 --> 01:16:12.598
so take this and treat your wound once every day.

809
01:16:12.598 --> 01:16:14.008
It's to prevent any infections.

810
01:16:14.008 --> 01:16:15.707
- Thank you. - Bye.

811
01:16:15.707 --> 01:16:16.768
Bye.

812
01:16:17.277 --> 01:16:19.808
We come here once every two weeks.

813
01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.678
Stop by if you need something.

814
01:16:26.577 --> 01:16:27.648
Nurse Jung.

815
01:16:29.287 --> 01:16:32.018
I'm sorry to call you out here when it's your day off today.

816
01:16:32.018 --> 01:16:33.518
Don't mention it.

817
01:16:33.787 --> 01:16:34.987
The weather is nice,

818
01:16:34.987 --> 01:16:36.558
so it's better to be here than to stay at home.

819
01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:38.398
I really wanted to participate in this too,

820
01:16:38.398 --> 01:16:40.298
so thank you for asking me.

821
01:16:40.298 --> 01:16:42.527
Thanks for taking it that way.

822
01:16:43.398 --> 01:16:45.167
Next person in line. Please go in.

823
01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.438
You have a back problem.

824
01:16:46.438 --> 01:16:48.067
Who is that man?

825
01:16:48.067 --> 01:16:49.737
I guess they're filming historical drama around here.

826
01:16:49.737 --> 01:16:51.938
Or maybe there's a place that rents out Joseon clothes near here.

827
01:16:51.938 --> 01:16:52.978
I guess so.

828
01:18:51.058 --> 01:18:52.428
It must've hurt a lot.

829
01:18:56.167 --> 01:18:57.968
How did you get yourself injured?

830
01:18:59.497 --> 01:19:01.367
I was on my way to meet someone.

831
01:19:03.737 --> 01:19:05.377
I fell down from my bike...

832
01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:07.247
as I was too much in a rush.

833
01:19:30.997 --> 01:19:32.268
I missed you.

834
01:19:40.848 --> 01:19:42.877
I am sorry that I came too late.

835
01:20:00.367 --> 01:20:02.827
In your life, there comes a time that you long for something...

836
01:20:03.567 --> 01:20:04.737
or want something.

837
01:20:05.298 --> 01:20:07.138
Then, an unexpected present visits you.

838
01:20:07.867 --> 01:20:09.407
That is a real reward.

839
01:20:11.008 --> 01:20:12.308
Did you not miss me?

840
01:20:15.447 --> 01:20:16.848
Are you going to be here for a little while?

841
01:20:17.478 --> 01:20:20.688
What do you mean, a little while? I am here to live with you.

842
01:20:21.787 --> 01:20:23.247
Who's going to live with you?

843
01:20:23.718 --> 01:20:25.487
Do you have a boyfriend by any chance?

844
01:20:26.358 --> 01:20:28.258
I have many male friends.

845
01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:30.027
What is a male friend?

846
01:20:30.657 --> 01:20:33.058
What is a male friend? Boyfriend, male friend.

847
01:20:33.558 --> 01:20:35.697
- What is the difference... - When are you leaving?

848
01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:40.067
I told you already. I came here to live with you.

849
01:20:40.567 --> 01:20:42.108
You said the same thing before.

850
01:20:42.108 --> 01:20:43.707
So I came here again.

851
01:20:44.138 --> 01:20:45.277
I am sorry.

852
01:20:45.678 --> 01:20:48.178
That's fine. You abandoned me once. You could abandon me twice then.

853
01:20:48.178 --> 01:20:49.707
I have never abandoned you.

854
01:20:49.707 --> 01:20:52.617
It is not like that. I thought it was impossible for me to live here.

855
01:20:52.617 --> 01:20:53.718
Forget it.

856
01:20:54.447 --> 01:20:56.188
Where else can I go?

857
01:20:56.447 --> 01:20:58.157
I cannot live without you now.

858
01:21:42.728 --> 01:21:49.567
(You should just remember this. You made my heart beat.)

859
01:21:54.008 --> 01:21:57.417
(Those of you who do your best are living up to your name now.)

860
01:21:57.417 --> 01:21:58.917
(Thank you for supporting "Live up To Your Name, Dr. Heo/Deserving of the Name".)
