00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:09.083
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:11.855
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

3
00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.464
Are you back from your mother's hospital?

4
00:00:19.994 --> 00:00:21.035
What?

5
00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:22.734
Yes.

6
00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:24.765
How's she? Is she okay?

7
00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:28.075
I told you not to act like you know anything about it.

8
00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:31.375
I asked because I was concerned.

9
00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:49.295
I will never tell anyone. I promise.

10
00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:51.365
What is...

11
00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:53.565
your name?

12
00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:55.595
You don't know my name?

13
00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:58.035
I was in the same class with you last year.

14
00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:00.335
Do I have to know everyone's name in the same class?

15
00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:01.674
Of course!

16
00:01:01.674 --> 00:01:04.305
That's the duty and manner...

17
00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:05.944
as a classmate.

18
00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:08.674
I didn't know I had such duty.

19
00:01:11.414 --> 00:01:13.684
Gosh, I even went to see her concert.

20
00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:25.694
Are those cases all assigned to me?

21
00:01:26.464 --> 00:01:28.565
Then do you think they're mine?

22
00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:30.565
Hold on.

23
00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:35.305
There's no space.

24
00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:40.714
Why don't you borrow Prosecutor Shin's cabinet?

25
00:01:40.714 --> 00:01:44.384
She works on the case so fast that there's no unsolved case.

26
00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:46.055
And there's much space in her cabinet.

27
00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:47.855
I'm fast too.

28
00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:50.424
Have you reserved a restaurant for our lunch today?

29
00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:51.454
That's your role.

30
00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:53.255
- I was going to. - Where?

31
00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:54.694
That's not what's important.

32
00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:58.664
It is. They say that juniors' performance reviews depend on...

33
00:01:58.664 --> 00:02:01.164
how well you reserve restaurants, rather than solving cases.

34
00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:04.634
You should be very careful in picking restaurants.

35
00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:07.434
I'll ask Prosecutor Shin's advice and decide carefully.

36
00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:10.605
Will she tell you?

37
00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:13.315
Of course, we are very close because we went to the same college.

38
00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:17.515
Hey, Hee Min.

39
00:02:18.585 --> 00:02:19.714
Hey, Shin Hee Min.

40
00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:23.525
Prosecutor Shin. Hello?

41
00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:26.055
Hey, Prosecutor Shin.

42
00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:28.025
(Office of Investigation Officer)

43
00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:31.724
Can't she hear well?

44
00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:34.734
You should've called her formally.

45
00:02:37.605 --> 00:02:41.305
You can't call her Hee Min. You should call her Prosecutor Shin.

46
00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:44.704
You can't be casual with her as she became a prosecutor before you.

47
00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:47.515
What is it? Why are you calling her so desperately?

48
00:02:48.474 --> 00:02:50.984
I heard that she was responsible for reserving restaurants before me.

49
00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:52.414
So I was going to ask her for tips.

50
00:02:52.414 --> 00:02:53.555
You brat. Just memorize them.

51
00:02:54.055 --> 00:02:58.055
Senior Prosecutor here does not like wet meat, so avoid shabu-shabu.

52
00:02:58.184 --> 00:03:00.795
The chief prosecutor does not like raw meat, so avoid sashimi.

53
00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:02.394
The assistant prosecutor has foot odor,

54
00:03:02.394 --> 00:03:04.164
so he doesn't like taking his shoes off.

55
00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:06.994
Prosecutor Shin doesn't like Italian cuisine, so remember that.

56
00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:10.434
Goodness, you shouldn't let him know those hard-earned tips.

57
00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:13.674
You're right, sir. He should pay me for these.

58
00:03:13.674 --> 00:03:15.404
You brat. Pay me...

59
00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:19.144
I'll get going, sir.

60
00:03:24.184 --> 00:03:25.285
What's wrong with him?

61
00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:27.714
It seems like he has hard feelings on you.

62
00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:31.625
I used to tutor Prosecutor Jung before.

63
00:03:32.184 --> 00:03:34.894
He probably thought I was treating him like my student.

64
00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:36.825
Even so. You must be embarrassed.

65
00:03:36.825 --> 00:03:39.664
No, I'm okay. I should have been more careful. It's my fault.

66
00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:54.244
I think it's that runaway soldier that was on the news.

67
00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:57.884
What do we do, Dad? What if we die like we did in my dream?

68
00:03:59.144 --> 00:04:02.355
Don't worry. No one's going to die today.

69
00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:07.224
I will...

70
00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:11.025
tell all the passengers to get off, saying the bus has broken down.

71
00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:12.295
Then,

72
00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:20.275
Gosh, I'm sorry.

73
00:04:20.275 --> 00:04:22.974
There seems to be a problem with the tires.

74
00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:24.605
I think I need to fix it.

75
00:04:25.204 --> 00:04:27.444
I'm sorry, but could you all use the next bus?

76
00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:29.174
- Darn it. - Gosh.

77
00:04:29.174 --> 00:04:31.285
- How can this happen? - Goodness.

78
00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:33.615
- What a waste of time. - I'm sorry.

79
00:04:34.184 --> 00:04:36.154
The next bus will be here soon.

80
00:04:36.154 --> 00:04:38.125
Gosh, what's wrong with the tires?

81
00:04:39.954 --> 00:04:42.355
- I'm sorry. - Oh no, it's raining so much.

82
00:04:42.724 --> 00:04:43.765
It's raining so much.

83
00:04:43.925 --> 00:04:44.994
Hey, Mr. Soldier.

84
00:04:48.894 --> 00:04:51.934
Hurry up and go. Go faster.

85
00:04:52.034 --> 00:04:54.235
Go faster!

86
00:05:08.784 --> 00:05:11.525
Could you give me a hand in changing the tires?

87
00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:14.125
Can you help me?

88
00:06:13.614 --> 00:06:15.925
Dad!

89
00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:41.945
Dad!

90
00:06:56.195 --> 00:06:58.425
(February 18, 2016. Seung Won...)

91
00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:08.375
(will become a murderer because of his brother.)

92
00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:12.244
Who is Seung Won?

93
00:07:13.974 --> 00:07:15.514
Who is he going to kill?

94
00:07:17.514 --> 00:07:18.784
Who is his brother?

95
00:07:29.764 --> 00:07:31.264
If you can't handle it, ignore all your dreams.

96
00:07:32.525 --> 00:07:34.335
As if they never happened.

97
00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:52.985
I need to talk to you.

98
00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:56.255
Are they flirting?

99
00:07:56.255 --> 00:07:58.485
- Oh, my goodness. - I never knew.

100
00:07:58.485 --> 00:07:59.494
Follow me.

101
00:08:11.804 --> 00:08:13.235
I told you not to act like you know it.

102
00:08:13.605 --> 00:08:15.605
I told you not to open your mouth!

103
00:08:16.074 --> 00:08:17.974
I saw you searching those in the computer lab.

104
00:08:21.545 --> 00:08:23.514
Why did you look up patricide sentence?

105
00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:25.385
Why did you look up...

106
00:08:25.414 --> 00:08:27.414
how to purchase potassium cyanide and the amount enough to kill?

107
00:08:29.824 --> 00:08:32.554
What are you thinking? Are you...

108
00:08:34.425 --> 00:08:35.965
going to kill your father?

109
00:08:36.094 --> 00:08:37.565
I'm saving my mom.

110
00:08:38.764 --> 00:08:40.195
My dad has to be gone,

111
00:08:41.264 --> 00:08:42.835
so that my mom can live.

112
00:08:42.864 --> 00:08:45.164
Why do you have to do that? You reported it to the police already.

113
00:08:46.175 --> 00:08:48.875
The prosecutor should have prosecuted the case already.

114
00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:50.905
Your father will be put on trial and sent to jail.

115
00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.105
Then you don't have to...

116
00:08:52.105 --> 00:08:53.715
What if he can't be prosecuted?

117
00:08:53.715 --> 00:08:56.545
- Why can't he? He committed crime. - He can't.

118
00:08:57.315 --> 00:09:00.255
My dad will never be put on trial because...

119
00:09:02.155 --> 00:09:03.824
prosecutors are dumb...

120
00:09:04.454 --> 00:09:05.925
and lawyers are sly.

121
00:09:05.925 --> 00:09:08.494
- Gosh. Hello. - You're here.

122
00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:12.594
I'm here as the lawyer of Park Jun Mo.

123
00:09:13.534 --> 00:09:16.264
Park Jun Mo? The one whose case was sent for domestic violence?

124
00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.034
That's right. He's my regular.

125
00:09:18.405 --> 00:09:20.875
Oh, you must know that pianist, Park So Yoon.

126
00:09:21.005 --> 00:09:22.474
- It's her dad. - I see.

127
00:09:22.505 --> 00:09:24.505
It seemed like a typical domestic violence.

128
00:09:28.074 --> 00:09:29.644
Have you finished reviewing the records?

129
00:09:30.644 --> 00:09:34.085
Yes. He kicked his wife with his shoes on.

130
00:09:34.085 --> 00:09:36.324
He broke six of her ribs.

131
00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:38.284
It's a case of injury.

132
00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:41.324
It should be dealt as assault.

133
00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:45.224
That sly lawyer will...

134
00:09:45.864 --> 00:09:48.635
make the case as assault, not injury.

135
00:09:49.405 --> 00:09:52.704
What's the difference between a case of injury and assault?

136
00:09:52.735 --> 00:09:54.534
If she's not hurt, it's an assault.

137
00:09:54.835 --> 00:09:56.204
If she's hurt, then it's an injury case.

138
00:09:56.344 --> 00:09:58.775
But your mother got hurt. She has broken ribs.

139
00:09:59.045 --> 00:10:01.375
So it must be an injury case, right?

140
00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:03.784
No, it's an assault case.

141
00:10:09.585 --> 00:10:11.155
That's Ms. Do Geum Sook's medical report.

142
00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:13.155
She has multiple ribs broken and a contusion.

143
00:10:14.295 --> 00:10:16.594
How can it be an assault case when there's a medical report?

144
00:10:17.295 --> 00:10:20.335
Hey, you should check the dates.

145
00:10:20.335 --> 00:10:22.735
The incident occurred on February 14.

146
00:10:22.764 --> 00:10:25.565
The medical report was written on February 10.

147
00:10:27.304 --> 00:10:28.675
(Issued on February 10, 2016)

148
00:10:28.675 --> 00:10:33.114
Does that mean Park Jun Mo didn't cause those broken ribs?

149
00:10:34.014 --> 00:10:36.385
- That's exactly right. - How did that happen?

150
00:10:37.885 --> 00:10:41.255
This is Ms. Do Geum Sook's credit card statement.

151
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:43.585
If you look at what she spent on February 10,

152
00:10:43.885 --> 00:10:48.025
she used a gondola and rented ski equipment at Chungyeon Resort.

153
00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:55.905
That means those ribs were not broken because of Park Jun Mo.

154
00:10:56.304 --> 00:10:59.635
Do Geum Sook broke them while skiing.

155
00:10:59.905 --> 00:11:01.034
Unless something comes up,

156
00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:03.474
that sly lawyer will...

157
00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:06.844
succeed in making the injury case into an assault case.

158
00:11:07.114 --> 00:11:08.715
Say that you're right.

159
00:11:09.945 --> 00:11:12.954
What's wrong with an assault case? It's a crime to be indicted too.

160
00:11:13.554 --> 00:11:14.554
You're right.

161
00:11:16.554 --> 00:11:18.425
It is indeed a crime, but is a strange one.

162
00:11:19.355 --> 00:11:22.454
It's a crime that can be punished if the victim approves of it.

163
00:11:24.594 --> 00:11:26.735
So if the victim does not want the assaulter to be punished,

164
00:11:27.235 --> 00:11:29.965
there's nothing that stupid prosecutor can do.

165
00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:31.465
The crime will disappear.

166
00:11:31.965 --> 00:11:34.875
Then you must ask your mom to approve the punishment.

167
00:11:35.605 --> 00:11:38.704
No, Prosecutor. I don't want him to be punished.

168
00:11:39.474 --> 00:11:41.574
It's true that I got hurt in a ski resort.

169
00:11:41.914 --> 00:11:43.784
My husband has nothing to do with it.

170
00:11:44.045 --> 00:11:45.545
Mom will tell them...

171
00:11:46.815 --> 00:11:48.585
that she doesn't want him to be punished, like she always did.

172
00:11:49.985 --> 00:11:51.954
- Yes. - Why not?

173
00:11:53.494 --> 00:11:56.894
- Mom is... - I'm sorry for causing trouble.

174
00:11:56.965 --> 00:11:58.994
more scared of my dad than the law.

175
00:12:08.804 --> 00:12:10.505
That's how it's

176
00:12:13.644 --> 00:12:15.545
done. I was really curious.

177
00:12:16.114 --> 00:12:18.244
- About what? - You said this earlier.

178
00:12:18.545 --> 00:12:20.315
That Park Jun Mo is your regular.

179
00:12:21.085 --> 00:12:23.585
How can a director of educational institution be your regular?

180
00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:25.485
What must he have done to make you his lawyer when you've become one...

181
00:12:25.485 --> 00:12:26.994
less than a year ago?

182
00:12:28.594 --> 00:12:32.664
From what you're wearing, it seems like you charge a lot.

183
00:12:32.764 --> 00:12:34.635
Why did you take such an obvious case?

184
00:12:36.434 --> 00:12:38.164
I was curious, but now I get it.

185
00:12:40.275 --> 00:12:43.005
- What is it that you want to say? - Do you do this all the time?

186
00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:46.675
Turning injury cases into assault ones...

187
00:12:46.844 --> 00:12:48.875
by fixing few documents, threatening the victims to not press charges,

188
00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:50.614
and make them sign consent forms?

189
00:12:51.184 --> 00:12:54.114
You erased his crimes, so that he can be your regular.

190
00:12:55.014 --> 00:12:56.855
How many times does he have to visit you to become a regular?

191
00:12:57.324 --> 00:12:58.655
Shouldn't we stop them?

192
00:13:00.454 --> 00:13:03.664
Prosecutor Jung, I think you are crossing the line.

193
00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:11.105
I wasn't sure, but you are as I expected.

194
00:13:14.735 --> 00:13:17.804
I get it that you have a grudge against me for something...

195
00:13:17.844 --> 00:13:19.344
that happened 13 years ago.

196
00:13:19.675 --> 00:13:21.715
But that should've ended with me.

197
00:13:21.844 --> 00:13:23.815
Why are you being grumpy to my client?

198
00:13:24.514 --> 00:13:25.514
Grumpy?

199
00:13:25.514 --> 00:13:27.715
Do you have any other words to explain what you've done to me...

200
00:13:27.755 --> 00:13:29.925
for the past few days?

201
00:13:31.284 --> 00:13:34.295
I can't understand it with any other words than grumpy.

202
00:13:35.224 --> 00:13:37.465
Listen. First of all,

203
00:13:38.195 --> 00:13:41.835
why did you flirt with my girlfriend and tell her to stop seeing me?

204
00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:44.034
Unbelievable.

205
00:13:45.664 --> 00:13:49.974
Second. Why did you bump into my car?

206
00:13:51.045 --> 00:13:52.375
He bumped into his car?

207
00:13:54.074 --> 00:13:55.074
Third.

208
00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:59.355
Why are you bothering me with a case that's so obvious?

209
00:13:59.355 --> 00:14:02.625
Why are you trying to start an argument?

210
00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:05.125
Don't be ridiculous. They are separate matters.

211
00:14:05.184 --> 00:14:06.195
Okay.

212
00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:10.894
But I think those three incidents lead to one reason.

213
00:14:12.164 --> 00:14:13.264
You're taking a revenge.

214
00:14:19.605 --> 00:14:20.835
This is crazy.

215
00:14:24.744 --> 00:14:25.775
Unbelievable.

216
00:14:25.775 --> 00:14:28.875
Prosecutor Jung purposely bumped into Prosecutor Lee's car.

217
00:14:30.585 --> 00:14:31.684
What?

218
00:14:32.784 --> 00:14:33.784
Why?

219
00:14:34.585 --> 00:14:37.925
I don't know. They were talking about revenges.

220
00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:41.355
They must have a back story we don't know about.

221
00:14:42.094 --> 00:14:43.195
A back story?

222
00:14:44.664 --> 00:14:45.824
What story?

223
00:14:46.864 --> 00:14:49.735
They say that Prosecutor Jung stole Prosecutor Lee's girlfriend.

224
00:14:50.434 --> 00:14:51.704
Maybe it's related to affairs!

225
00:14:53.574 --> 00:14:54.675
Affairs?

226
00:14:57.375 --> 00:14:59.644
How wild and messy.

227
00:15:00.474 --> 00:15:04.514
I'm not asking you to work miracles just because I know you.

228
00:15:05.514 --> 00:15:08.385
I'm not even asking you to not punish him.

229
00:15:09.054 --> 00:15:12.224
I'm just asking you to follow the law and principles we learned.

230
00:15:15.394 --> 00:15:18.525
Get it approved by senior prosecutor and make it unprosecutable.

231
00:15:18.764 --> 00:15:21.164
Don't be grumpy to my client.

232
00:15:25.135 --> 00:15:26.905
Follow the laws, won't you?

233
00:15:28.434 --> 00:15:29.445
I'll get going.

234
00:15:31.005 --> 00:15:36.014
And please stop acting like a child.

235
00:15:36.114 --> 00:15:38.985
Your behavior is too childish for me to handle.

236
00:15:42.655 --> 00:15:43.655
I'm really going.

237
00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:45.224
Goodbye.

238
00:15:45.224 --> 00:15:46.625
- Bye. - See you.

239
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:56.164
That stupid prosecutor will never save my mom.

240
00:15:57.335 --> 00:15:59.235
That's how it always has been.

241
00:16:00.005 --> 00:16:02.744
There must be another way.

242
00:16:03.175 --> 00:16:05.204
The old sayings are never wrong.

243
00:16:07.514 --> 00:16:08.815
Where drums beat,

244
00:16:10.045 --> 00:16:11.184
laws are silent.

245
00:16:12.985 --> 00:16:14.054
That's how it is.

246
00:16:33.574 --> 00:16:36.074
Hey, Hee Min. I'm here.

247
00:16:36.744 --> 00:16:38.244
Hee Min, over here.

248
00:16:38.505 --> 00:16:39.974
Over here. Hey!

249
00:16:40.144 --> 00:16:41.914
It's not that she can't hear you.

250
00:16:41.914 --> 00:16:43.684
Just call her Prosecutor Shin.

251
00:16:45.414 --> 00:16:47.585
Hee Min! Hey!

252
00:16:48.114 --> 00:16:49.625
Shin Hee Min, over here.

253
00:16:51.855 --> 00:16:53.394
You guys were there.

254
00:16:53.525 --> 00:16:54.925
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:55.855 --> 00:16:57.864
The sign is so small. I got lost.

256
00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:02.764
What's your religion, Prosecutor Jung?

257
00:17:03.534 --> 00:17:04.835
I don't have one.

258
00:17:12.945 --> 00:17:14.375
Why, what's wrong with that?

259
00:17:15.175 --> 00:17:18.014
No, no. It's just all of us share the same religion.

260
00:17:18.014 --> 00:17:19.815
We take turns in praying before our meal.

261
00:17:20.454 --> 00:17:22.985
Don't worry about us and go ahead first.

262
00:17:22.985 --> 00:17:24.755
- Okay. - Let's pray.

263
00:17:25.755 --> 00:17:28.525
Prosecutor Cha, why don't you begin for today?

264
00:17:28.525 --> 00:17:29.565
All right.

265
00:17:29.894 --> 00:17:34.465
Thank you so much for giving us this meal. Give blessings to...

266
00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:38.335
those who don't believe in you.

267
00:17:38.534 --> 00:17:41.704
Please give a guidance to Prosecutor Jung to find a restaurant...

268
00:17:41.835 --> 00:17:45.105
with a bigger sign, so that nobody gets lost while looking for it.

269
00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:48.715
I belong in an organization where manners and order are important.

270
00:17:48.715 --> 00:17:51.844
Teach those poor lambs that order and manners are more important...

271
00:17:51.844 --> 00:17:54.855
than an age. Please give them blessings.

272
00:17:54.914 --> 00:17:57.525
Unsolved cases are piling up at Prosecutor Jung's office.

273
00:17:57.755 --> 00:18:01.394
Please give him guidance to quickly deal with the cases,

274
00:18:01.394 --> 00:18:02.824
so that the victims don't have to shed any more tears.

275
00:18:02.894 --> 00:18:06.965
Also, please help the soul who disgraced all prosecutors with...

276
00:18:07.094 --> 00:18:10.864
wrong attire. Allow him to have the wisdom to pick the right clothes.

277
00:18:11.065 --> 00:18:13.505
The world is filled with jealousy and anger.

278
00:18:13.534 --> 00:18:16.445
That's why some people can't let go of their past and hold grudges.

279
00:18:16.445 --> 00:18:19.204
They sometimes can't work on cases fairly.

280
00:18:19.204 --> 00:18:20.244
That's because...

281
00:18:20.244 --> 00:18:22.514
Even when we get angry with grudges,

282
00:18:23.114 --> 00:18:26.315
we must solve the cases with rational mindset.

283
00:18:26.684 --> 00:18:29.585
Please guide those to...

284
00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:33.125
keep the principles of prosecutors. I pray hard for them.

285
00:18:33.155 --> 00:18:34.724
- Amen. - Amen.

286
00:18:35.295 --> 00:18:36.465
Let's eat.

287
00:18:37.465 --> 00:18:39.864
Oh, hey. What happened? Why haven't you started?

288
00:18:40.235 --> 00:18:42.494
Oh, I was eating all right.

289
00:18:43.135 --> 00:18:45.635
Here. Have one of these.

290
00:18:47.804 --> 00:18:49.375
- Enjoy. - You too.

291
00:18:56.014 --> 00:18:57.014
What are you doing?

292
00:18:57.684 --> 00:19:00.485
What do you mean? I'm dealing with these today.

293
00:19:02.485 --> 00:19:04.885
Isn't that a bit too much to finish within today?

294
00:19:04.885 --> 00:19:07.224
I'm going to stay up all night if I have to.

295
00:19:07.525 --> 00:19:10.764
I can empty that stupid cabinet within a day if I try.

296
00:19:12.394 --> 00:19:14.295
What a great timing. It's Park Jun Mo case.

297
00:19:14.764 --> 00:19:17.335
It has medical reports and a consent form.

298
00:19:17.335 --> 00:19:19.905
I can just be done with it if I treat it as unprosecutable.

299
00:19:20.335 --> 00:19:22.474
It'll only take five minutes.

300
00:19:23.344 --> 00:19:24.344
Here we go.

301
00:19:24.945 --> 00:19:26.144
Accused, Park Jun Mo.

302
00:19:26.144 --> 00:19:28.014
He's charged for assault.

303
00:19:28.275 --> 00:19:32.485
The injured party does not wish the accused to be punished.

304
00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:35.014
Therefore, the case is unprosecutable.

305
00:19:35.454 --> 00:19:36.454
The end.

306
00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:38.485
It didn't even take five minutes.

307
00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:40.195
At this rate, I won't have to stay up all night.

308
00:19:40.295 --> 00:19:42.324
Let's see. The next case is regarding unregistered license.

309
00:19:44.695 --> 00:19:45.894
This will take only three minutes.

310
00:19:46.735 --> 00:19:47.795
Unregistered license.

311
00:19:47.934 --> 00:19:50.465
What's gotten into him? I can't get used to it.

312
00:19:52.704 --> 00:19:54.505
He's completely drunk.

313
00:19:55.335 --> 00:19:56.344
Are we going home early today?

314
00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:05.985
I'm at the funeral home of Inspector Jung Il Seung and the bus driver...

315
00:20:05.985 --> 00:20:09.585
Nam Chul Du who saved people from the runaway soldier.

316
00:20:10.684 --> 00:20:14.195
The politicians requested to award national merit and make them...

317
00:20:14.195 --> 00:20:17.295
martyr for the courage they showed to save the citizens.

318
00:20:20.864 --> 00:20:23.335
Where's his son? I thought he was on the bus with him.

319
00:20:23.605 --> 00:20:25.105
I need to get his interview again.

320
00:20:25.264 --> 00:20:27.704
I know. I heard that he evacuated every passenger.

321
00:20:27.775 --> 00:20:29.445
Where's that boy?

322
00:20:29.704 --> 00:20:32.474
The congressman wants to deliver a consoling word.

323
00:20:32.574 --> 00:20:36.144
Reporter Mun, did you take the photo of our congressman paying respect?

324
00:20:36.815 --> 00:20:38.445
Yes, I did. You did, right?

325
00:20:38.644 --> 00:20:40.485
- Let's go. - Let's go.

326
00:20:58.764 --> 00:20:59.775
Sir.

327
00:21:03.505 --> 00:21:04.804
He's burned out.

328
00:21:05.275 --> 00:21:06.744
I knew it was too much for him.

329
00:21:08.344 --> 00:21:10.284
- No! - Gosh! That was startling.

330
00:21:14.114 --> 00:21:15.114
You startled me.

331
00:21:15.454 --> 00:21:16.784
My heart almost burst.

332
00:21:20.295 --> 00:21:22.224
Did you have a bad dream?

333
00:21:24.394 --> 00:21:25.695
No, I wasn't sleeping.

334
00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:27.795
I think you're crying right now.

335
00:21:29.405 --> 00:21:30.405
No, I'm not.

336
00:21:40.514 --> 00:21:43.485
- Hold on. - Jae Chan, save me.

337
00:21:43.485 --> 00:21:45.445
It wasn't me.

338
00:21:45.445 --> 00:21:46.585
It wasn't me.

339
00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:54.125
Hello?

340
00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:55.695
Where are you?

341
00:21:56.864 --> 00:21:57.925
I'm at school.

342
00:21:58.125 --> 00:21:59.164
Did anything happen?

343
00:21:59.434 --> 00:22:01.664
Are you sick or did you get hurt somewhere?

344
00:22:01.795 --> 00:22:03.405
Nothing happened. Why?

345
00:22:05.664 --> 00:22:06.735
Okay. That's all.

346
00:22:07.505 --> 00:22:08.505
What time are you coming home?

347
00:22:10.644 --> 00:22:12.405
I don't know. Maybe around 10pm.

348
00:22:12.405 --> 00:22:14.945
Don't go anywhere and come home straight. Got it?

349
00:22:15.045 --> 00:22:17.514
Who do you think I am? I have nowhere else to go.

350
00:22:18.144 --> 00:22:19.144
Okay.

351
00:22:34.565 --> 00:22:36.065
I'm saving my mom.

352
00:22:36.405 --> 00:22:37.835
My dad has to be gone,

353
00:22:38.905 --> 00:22:40.505
so that my mom can live.

354
00:22:44.644 --> 00:22:48.914
That's right. It was just a dream. It's nothing.

355
00:22:52.514 --> 00:22:54.855
- Let me go! - You shouldn't do this.

356
00:22:56.655 --> 00:22:58.525
I told you to believe me.

357
00:23:00.925 --> 00:23:03.824
If you believed me, you could have stopped it.

358
00:23:06.835 --> 00:23:08.364
Gosh.

359
00:23:10.105 --> 00:23:11.635
Gosh, darn it.

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

361
00:23:50.844 --> 00:23:51.844
Then,

362
00:23:52.614 --> 00:23:54.644
check if everyone's off the bus.

363
00:23:56.184 --> 00:23:59.885
When everyone got off, take them as far away as you can. Okay?

364
00:23:59.885 --> 00:24:01.755
Let's just run away together.

365
00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:03.724
This is exactly like my dream.

366
00:24:03.724 --> 00:24:07.394
I'm the captain of this bus. How can I just leave everyone behind?

367
00:24:07.494 --> 00:24:09.155
Dad, please.

368
00:24:09.195 --> 00:24:12.264
You brat. Say for instance that a catcher avoids the ball.

369
00:24:12.264 --> 00:24:14.795
The referee will get hit instead and the game will be a total mess.

370
00:24:16.235 --> 00:24:17.704
I will grow my hair.

371
00:24:18.664 --> 00:24:20.605
I know that's what you want.

372
00:24:22.775 --> 00:24:25.744
I'll grow my hair, so please get off with me.

373
00:24:25.804 --> 00:24:26.815
Really?

374
00:24:28.215 --> 00:24:29.215
Okay.

375
00:24:30.114 --> 00:24:32.184
I will make sure to watch you grow hair.

376
00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:35.715
Get off first, okay?

377
00:25:15.255 --> 00:25:17.664
But that kid was his daughter, not a son.

378
00:25:18.465 --> 00:25:20.565
That kid who was on the bus.

379
00:25:21.094 --> 00:25:22.704
It was a daughter, not a son.

380
00:25:23.164 --> 00:25:24.505
Really?

381
00:25:28.804 --> 00:25:31.545
Ma'am, where's your daughter?

382
00:25:35.914 --> 00:25:39.114
Hong Joo is not here right now.

383
00:25:44.724 --> 00:25:45.755
You startled me.

384
00:25:49.795 --> 00:25:52.094
What's so urgent at this hour?

385
00:25:54.735 --> 00:25:56.704
I'm not here because I changed my mind.

386
00:25:57.364 --> 00:25:59.775
I came to explain why I don't believe your words.

387
00:26:01.235 --> 00:26:02.235
Tell me.

388
00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:03.445
I'm a prosecutor.

389
00:26:04.445 --> 00:26:06.875
What I do is to prosecute people when crimes occur.

390
00:26:07.275 --> 00:26:08.474
I don't prevent crimes.

391
00:26:09.644 --> 00:26:12.755
I mean there's nothing I can do even if you tell me your dreams.

392
00:26:13.054 --> 00:26:15.255
I don't care who dies in your dream.

393
00:26:15.255 --> 00:26:17.554
I don't have to suffer from it.

394
00:26:18.625 --> 00:26:19.625
But...

395
00:26:22.025 --> 00:26:23.394
You feel like a catcher, don't you?

396
00:26:30.565 --> 00:26:32.905
A ball is thrown at the speed of 160km per hour.

397
00:26:33.304 --> 00:26:34.675
You're too scared to catch it.

398
00:26:35.534 --> 00:26:37.304
But you can't avoid it because you'll ruin the game then.

399
00:26:38.244 --> 00:26:39.244
That's it, right?

400
00:26:43.514 --> 00:26:44.514
You're right.

401
00:26:45.244 --> 00:26:47.184
I can't ignore it even if I don't want to believe it.

402
00:26:47.684 --> 00:26:49.684
It's because I'm having those dreams too.

403
00:26:50.585 --> 00:26:52.224
Why did you transmit it to me?

404
00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:55.494
- Why me? - I don't know why it's you either.

405
00:26:55.594 --> 00:26:58.764
I don't even know why I started having such dreams.

406
00:26:59.335 --> 00:27:02.295
But there must be a reason why it has to be you and me.

407
00:27:48.644 --> 00:27:49.684
I don't know.

408
00:27:51.385 --> 00:27:53.885
What if there is? So what?

409
00:27:54.184 --> 00:27:55.454
You can't prevent them because you are a prosecutor,

410
00:27:55.454 --> 00:27:56.925
and you don't want to believe my words.

411
00:27:57.025 --> 00:27:58.355
And you're blaming it all on me?

412
00:27:58.684 --> 00:28:00.155
Is that why you're here?

413
00:28:06.264 --> 00:28:07.264
Help me.

414
00:28:12.974 --> 00:28:14.704
You appeared in my dream.

415
00:28:16.445 --> 00:28:18.574
You resented me for not listening to your words.

416
00:28:18.704 --> 00:28:21.275
Seung Won got on a police car or an ambulance and disappeared.

417
00:28:22.614 --> 00:28:23.985
What kind of dream is this?

418
00:28:25.244 --> 00:28:26.355
Seung Won...

419
00:28:27.784 --> 00:28:28.914
Who is Seung Won?

420
00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:32.355
My little brother. Why?

421
00:28:36.894 --> 00:28:37.994
In my dream,

422
00:28:38.894 --> 00:28:40.295
that Seung Won guy...

423
00:28:42.494 --> 00:28:43.965
killed a person.

424
00:28:46.605 --> 00:28:47.704
Pardon?

425
00:29:09.965 --> 00:29:10.965
Seung Won.

426
00:29:12.264 --> 00:29:14.434
Hey, you remembered my name.

427
00:29:15.034 --> 00:29:16.804
Then he blamed...

428
00:29:17.105 --> 00:29:19.574
his older brother for the murder.

429
00:29:22.804 --> 00:29:25.244
Then that older brother is you?

430
00:29:28.675 --> 00:29:31.045
Did you follow me?

431
00:29:32.445 --> 00:29:35.684
Yes, let's go together. I'll take you home.

(While You Were Sleeping)

434
00:30:18.264 --> 00:30:20.965
Is it related to Park Jun Mo case? Because you let him go...

435
00:30:20.965 --> 00:30:21.965
It's all because of you.

436
00:30:21.965 --> 00:30:23.304
Don't you have contact lens?

437
00:30:23.304 --> 00:30:25.135
Do I look different without glasses? Are you falling for me again?

438
00:30:25.135 --> 00:30:26.235
Isn't the case over?

439
00:30:26.235 --> 00:30:27.235
I brought it back.

440
00:30:27.434 --> 00:30:28.875
I'm going to dig it until the end.

441
00:30:28.905 --> 00:30:30.974
Why is it so hard to hear that I'm expecting much?

442
00:30:30.974 --> 00:30:32.744
That means you'll be disappointed if I fail.

443
00:30:32.744 --> 00:30:35.474
Why do you especially don't want to disappoint me? Why me?

444
00:30:35.474 --> 00:30:37.114
What do you do, Ms. Nam Hong Joo?

445
00:30:37.114 --> 00:30:38.545
Are you interested in me?

446
00:30:38.545 --> 00:30:39.885
Does that mean we're starting something?
