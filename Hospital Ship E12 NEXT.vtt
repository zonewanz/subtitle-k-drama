00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:09.937
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:28.444
My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's...

3
00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:30.675
two years ago.

4
00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:35.614
He got out of Syria and was diagnosed in Turkey.

5
00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:40.084
He hid it.

6
00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:44.025
Do you think he didn't want to return?

7
00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:48.925
Maybe he didn't want to be a burden.

8
00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:54.434
As his condition worsened, he started to lose his way.

9
00:00:55.904 --> 00:00:57.504
The rebels caught him.

10
00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:02.074
They released him for being a doctor...

11
00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:05.644
But everyone found out.

12
00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.114
We got a call...

13
00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:10.545
to pick him up.

14
00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:14.384
That was when...

15
00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:17.925
the real battle began.

16
00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:21.724
I think my dad's memory...

17
00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:23.894
is frozen to when he was in the rebel camp.

18
00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:29.265
Maybe Seoul felt like a huge base.

19
00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:32.134
He never stopped...

20
00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:34.405
trying to escape.

21
00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:41.845
Dad.

22
00:01:42.444 --> 00:01:43.485
Dad!

23
00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:52.925
I must get away.

24
00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.644
I was studying for my exams, working the night shift,

25
00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:19.054
and playing hide and seek...

26
00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.355
with my dad every single day.

27
00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:25.955
It's okay now, Dad.

28
00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:29.325
He's flat-lining.

29
00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:31.334
Oxygen. Defibrillator.

30
00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:33.295
Clear!

31
00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:35.535
Hurry.

32
00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:44.614
Then I messed up.

33
00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.214
I made a mistake that no fellow,

34
00:02:49.184 --> 00:02:51.214
not even an intern does.

35
00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:54.855
Do you call yourself a doctor?

36
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:57.184
Not even an intern makes that mistake.

37
00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.524
Remember this.

38
00:02:59.524 --> 00:03:01.964
That patient died because of you.

39
00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:03.825
You're no doctor.

40
00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:20.415
That's when...

41
00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:23.015
my left hand became useless.

42
00:03:31.755 --> 00:03:34.195
Whenever my dad's lucid, he asks me...

43
00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:36.825
for some morphine.

44
00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:39.894
So he can die.

45
00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:44.675
Isn't that funny?

46
00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:48.175
A doctor dad wants...

47
00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:50.575
his doctor son to kill him.

48
00:03:54.415 --> 00:03:56.045
My dad's the reason...

49
00:03:57.184 --> 00:03:59.255
I didn't stop Mr. Seol.

50
00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:03.184
I couldn't.

51
00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:06.255
I didn't want to stop him.

52
00:04:07.255 --> 00:04:09.795
Even if it's not Alzheimer's like my dad,

53
00:04:10.094 --> 00:04:12.864
an illness can take over the patient's psyche, can't it?

54
00:04:14.735 --> 00:04:16.334
Mr. Seol wants to...

55
00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:18.675
keep his pride intact.

56
00:04:19.574 --> 00:04:21.045
He wants to die...

57
00:04:21.145 --> 00:04:24.175
a dignified and decent death.

58
00:04:29.845 --> 00:04:31.554
Maybe that's better.

59
00:04:33.754 --> 00:04:36.754
Maybe that's better than living an extended life...

60
00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:39.994
with a crushed self like my dad.

61
00:04:46.694 --> 00:04:48.335
You're right.

62
00:04:51.134 --> 00:04:52.704
Maybe I do lack...

63
00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:55.475
the right to be a doctor.

64
00:05:41.054 --> 00:05:44.525
(Orthopedic Surgery)

65
00:05:53.994 --> 00:05:55.405
What happened?

66
00:05:55.405 --> 00:05:58.105
Have you still not persuaded Mr. Seol?

67
00:05:58.804 --> 00:06:01.874
- Not yet. - He was discharged a while ago.

68
00:06:02.074 --> 00:06:05.215
What if you wait too long and miss the opportunity?

69
00:06:06.675 --> 00:06:09.985
It can't be helped. Don't be too upset.

70
00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:12.554
You'll get plenty of shots at...

71
00:06:12.554 --> 00:06:15.285
completing your paper in the future.

72
00:07:03.634 --> 00:07:05.905
It's me. Is the offer...

73
00:07:06.934 --> 00:07:08.675
still on the table?

74
00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:10.675
(Staff members only)

75
00:07:10.675 --> 00:07:11.814
Who was it?

76
00:07:13.215 --> 00:07:16.114
Eun Jae's getting more and more amusing.

77
00:07:22.124 --> 00:07:23.124
Thank you.

78
00:07:23.124 --> 00:07:24.624
- Take care. - Bye.

79
00:07:29.725 --> 00:07:30.795
Hello?

80
00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:34.704
You're whom?

81
00:07:38.134 --> 00:07:39.605
I'm here.

82
00:07:43.675 --> 00:07:45.944
Mr. Seol. Mr. Seol.

83
00:07:46.244 --> 00:07:48.415
Mr. Seol. Mr. Seol.

84
00:07:49.684 --> 00:07:51.514
Mr. Seol. Mr. Seol.

85
00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:53.684
Mr. Seol.

86
00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:56.155
Mr. Seol.

87
00:08:09.764 --> 00:08:12.634
Do you know where you are?

88
00:08:17.145 --> 00:08:18.215
Who...

89
00:08:18.215 --> 00:08:20.244
Doctor Kwak brought you in.

90
00:08:24.184 --> 00:08:26.384
He went out to make a call.

91
00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:34.824
Thank you.

92
00:08:36.194 --> 00:08:38.635
I had a terrible stomach ache.

93
00:08:39.934 --> 00:08:41.334
I feel better now.

94
00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:44.734
I think I'll be able to...

95
00:08:44.734 --> 00:08:47.234
Will you discharge yourself?

96
00:08:48.474 --> 00:08:49.545
Yes.

97
00:08:50.545 --> 00:08:52.714
This is just a temporary solution.

98
00:08:53.474 --> 00:08:55.415
Without any treatment...

99
00:08:56.684 --> 00:08:59.155
Things will only get worse.

100
00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:00.755
- So... - In November...

101
00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:04.054
I will publish a book of poems.

102
00:09:05.495 --> 00:09:08.064
I'm a few poems short, and I need to...

103
00:09:08.064 --> 00:09:09.625
keep writing.

104
00:09:11.295 --> 00:09:12.464
Mr. Seol.

105
00:09:13.064 --> 00:09:16.104
I've been writing a column for over 10 years.

106
00:09:16.104 --> 00:09:18.204
I can't suddenly stop.

107
00:09:18.405 --> 00:09:20.675
That's no way to treat my readers.

108
00:09:21.175 --> 00:09:23.145
What's most important...

109
00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:27.275
is the upcoming autumn picnic with the kids.

110
00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:29.615
It's six months.

111
00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:33.115
You may love to teach and write,

112
00:09:33.854 --> 00:09:37.495
but you can only do that for six more months.

113
00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:41.265
- If you're unlucky... - Three months.

114
00:09:44.934 --> 00:09:46.734
I'll have three months.

115
00:09:48.064 --> 00:09:50.005
That's a long time.

116
00:09:51.005 --> 00:09:53.405
If I were to die on the table,

117
00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:56.204
I can't even dream about it anymore.

118
00:10:17.934 --> 00:10:19.365
He wants to leave.

119
00:10:20.165 --> 00:10:21.934
As soon as possible.

120
00:10:22.765 --> 00:10:24.234
He must catch the first boat...

121
00:10:25.905 --> 00:10:27.844
to make it to class in time.

122
00:10:30.275 --> 00:10:31.574
Are you still...

123
00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:35.045
reluctant to persuade him?

124
00:10:36.984 --> 00:10:40.054
I'm not saying his dignity isn't important.

125
00:10:40.655 --> 00:10:41.724
But...

126
00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:47.054
is that more important than his life?

127
00:10:54.304 --> 00:10:58.104
It's the same blue sky and blue sea,

128
00:10:58.505 --> 00:10:59.834
but it's not like yesterday's.

129
00:11:01.604 --> 00:11:03.675
It's so very different.

130
00:11:05.175 --> 00:11:06.574
If I were a doctor,

131
00:11:07.785 --> 00:11:09.515
if I'm to have the right,

132
00:11:10.084 --> 00:11:12.084
I shouldn't be leaving with you.

133
00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:16.125
If I can't persuade you, I must abduct you...

134
00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:18.324
and get you into the OR.

135
00:11:19.995 --> 00:11:21.125
Hyun.

136
00:11:21.564 --> 00:11:23.895
A doctor fights instead of giving in.

137
00:11:24.295 --> 00:11:25.895
Death is a failure.

138
00:11:26.694 --> 00:11:27.934
Whatever people say,

139
00:11:28.734 --> 00:11:30.464
death is a failure.

140
00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:34.245
That's why a doctor, if I were a doctor,

141
00:11:35.545 --> 00:11:37.944
I shouldn't accept failure so readily.

142
00:11:38.515 --> 00:11:41.115
I shouldn't give in. I must fight.

143
00:11:42.944 --> 00:11:45.285
Why do you think death is a failure?

144
00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:49.724
Death comes to everyone equally when the time comes.

145
00:11:49.824 --> 00:11:51.425
Why is that a failure?

146
00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:55.925
Death is a conclusion, not a failure.

147
00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:59.165
That's just the conclusion I chose.

148
00:12:00.234 --> 00:12:04.474
I can't say I'm not scared at all,

149
00:12:05.135 --> 00:12:06.505
but I'm okay.

150
00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:10.844
My wife...

151
00:12:11.275 --> 00:12:14.314
has been waiting for me for 10 years.

152
00:12:15.984 --> 00:12:19.554
She's shy and has trouble making friends.

153
00:12:19.554 --> 00:12:21.724
She must be so lonely.

154
00:12:22.925 --> 00:12:24.094
I want to...

155
00:12:26.954 --> 00:12:28.765
go and see her.

156
00:12:33.464 --> 00:12:34.865
I'm really sorry.

157
00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:37.405
And thanks.

158
00:12:39.074 --> 00:12:40.474
Your eyes.

159
00:12:41.204 --> 00:12:44.214
Your eyes always look at me, worry about me,

160
00:12:44.645 --> 00:12:47.275
and at times, hurt more for me.

161
00:12:47.484 --> 00:12:50.984
Because of those eyes, I didn't feel like I was sick.

162
00:12:57.594 --> 00:12:59.025
You know,

163
00:13:01.165 --> 00:13:02.895
I think...

164
00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:05.995
those eyes of yours,

165
00:13:06.734 --> 00:13:09.564
and the intensity with which you empathize with patients...

166
00:13:10.104 --> 00:13:12.875
will be the best medical treatment...

167
00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.204
that you can provide to patients.

168
00:13:45.228 --> 00:13:48.460

169
00:14:18.974 --> 00:14:23.604
Every day, When the sun sets, I walk to the trees.

170
00:14:25.175 --> 00:14:30.015
Every day, When the sun sets, I walk to the river.

171
00:14:32.385 --> 00:14:37.155
Every day, When the sun sets, I walk to the mountain.

00:14:38.094 --> 00:14:39.125
Get it.

173
00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:40.495
It is beautiful

174
00:14:40.495 --> 00:14:43.295
- To walk to the trees, mountain, - Got it!

175
00:14:43.724 --> 00:14:45.434
- And river when the sun sets. - She caught it.

176
00:14:54.204 --> 00:14:58.314
When the sun sets, I long for my love,

177
00:14:58.875 --> 00:15:03.444
And walk toward my love.

178
00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:07.255
Nothing in this world is more beautiful than that.

179
00:15:11.224 --> 00:15:12.454
What are you doing?

180
00:15:13.795 --> 00:15:16.224
Is that a poetry book? Do you read poems often?

181
00:15:16.224 --> 00:15:18.434
It's been 14 years and 8 months.

182
00:15:21.005 --> 00:15:23.304
I see they're all Mr. Seol's poems.

183
00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.474
Someone said...

184
00:15:27.775 --> 00:15:29.444
if I want to persuade someone,

185
00:15:30.175 --> 00:15:32.314
I must understand him first.

186
00:15:33.314 --> 00:15:35.944
- What do you think? - It's moving.

187
00:15:39.184 --> 00:15:41.724
But it isn't more moving than a life.

188
00:15:43.885 --> 00:15:46.925
- Where are you going? - I told you.

189
00:15:47.724 --> 00:15:49.795
It isn't more moving than a life.

190
00:15:49.795 --> 00:15:51.265
Leave him alone.

191
00:15:51.265 --> 00:15:53.694
No, I can't do that.

192
00:15:53.694 --> 00:15:55.665
Why do you want to operate so badly?

193
00:15:56.135 --> 00:15:58.005
Why are you so obsessed?

194
00:15:58.005 --> 00:16:01.745
Does a doctor need a reason to save a patient's life?

195
00:16:01.745 --> 00:16:04.074
No, there's another reason.

196
00:16:04.074 --> 00:16:06.145
What do you want me to say? Aren't you sick of this yet?

197
00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:08.444
- You have another reason. - Fine, I'm selfish.

198
00:16:08.444 --> 00:16:11.854
I'm selfish, and I'm obsessed with returning to Seoul.

199
00:16:11.854 --> 00:16:14.684
- I'm trying to fill my thesis... - Stop lying.

200
00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:16.785
If the thesis...

201
00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:19.495
was so important, why did you offer it to Dr. Kim Do Hoon?

202
00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:22.224
I heard you said if he lets you operate,

203
00:16:22.224 --> 00:16:24.464
and gives you the best staff possible,

204
00:16:24.964 --> 00:16:26.995
he could keep your thesis.

205
00:16:29.135 --> 00:16:32.074
Why are you willing to go so far to operate?

206
00:16:34.145 --> 00:16:36.145
My mom died...

207
00:16:38.245 --> 00:16:39.675
because I wasn't there.

208
00:16:41.944 --> 00:16:45.015
But I'm here for that patient.

209
00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:50.084
She could've lived.

210
00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:54.525
She could've lived, but I...

211
00:16:55.495 --> 00:16:59.734
But I cut off the opportunity...

212
00:17:01.005 --> 00:17:03.304
for my mom to live.

213
00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:11.514
I won't repeat that.

214
00:17:12.474 --> 00:17:14.484
The patient is still alive,

215
00:17:14.984 --> 00:17:17.284
and as long as he's alive, there's hope.

216
00:17:19.954 --> 00:17:22.925
So I can't give up. No, I won't.

217
00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:26.754
If I give up, I...

218
00:17:37.335 --> 00:17:39.075
It isn't your fault.

219
00:17:42.474 --> 00:17:44.375
It isn't your fault.

220
00:18:18.145 --> 00:18:20.544
Mr. Seol asked me to bring this to you.

221
00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:24.115
What is it?

222
00:18:24.454 --> 00:18:26.484
He's donating his body.

223
00:18:27.425 --> 00:18:30.655
He wants to donate it to you.

224
00:18:31.494 --> 00:18:33.425
He says he's sorry for not getting the surgery,

225
00:18:34.665 --> 00:18:36.825
but that he wants to contribute to the research.

226
00:18:40.534 --> 00:18:43.165
Mr. Seol Jae Chan said...

227
00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:44.805
death...

228
00:18:46.274 --> 00:18:48.905
is not a failure, but a conclusion.

229
00:18:51.514 --> 00:18:53.744
What do you think?

230
00:18:55.284 --> 00:18:57.014
I'm not sure yet.

231
00:18:58.315 --> 00:19:00.014
It's too difficult a problem.

232
00:19:00.355 --> 00:19:02.585
It's also a question...

233
00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:07.155
we'll keep facing as long as we are doctors.

234
00:19:27.244 --> 00:19:29.085
Baby shark

235
00:19:30.014 --> 00:19:31.385
Cute

236
00:19:31.984 --> 00:19:33.385
In the ocean

237
00:19:34.055 --> 00:19:35.684
Baby shark

238
00:19:35.684 --> 00:19:37.284
Mommy shark

239
00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:39.425
They're dancing

240
00:19:40.254 --> 00:19:41.595
Good.

241
00:19:41.724 --> 00:19:43.095
- Goodness. - Hello.

242
00:19:43.095 --> 00:19:46.165
Thank you for coming all the way here.

243
00:19:46.335 --> 00:19:47.464
Gosh.

244
00:19:48.234 --> 00:19:50.734
- We should've gone... - Thank you.

245
00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:52.575
- to the center. - Okay.

246
00:19:52.675 --> 00:19:55.774
But his knee is too weak.

247
00:19:56.645 --> 00:19:58.115
It hurts.

248
00:19:58.115 --> 00:19:59.575
Does it hurt a lot?

249
00:20:00.944 --> 00:20:02.484
I'll give you some medicine.

250
00:20:12.325 --> 00:20:14.224
(Hospital Ship: On-land Clinic)

251
00:20:14.224 --> 00:20:15.825
Okay.

252
00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:18.635
- Hello, everyone! - Hello.

253
00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:19.665
Long time no see.

254
00:20:19.665 --> 00:20:21.534
- Hello. - Are you okay?

255
00:20:21.534 --> 00:20:23.534
- Careful. - Hi there.

256
00:20:23.534 --> 00:20:26.305
- Have you eaten? - Hello.

257
00:20:26.504 --> 00:20:28.905
- Take your time. - Hello.

258
00:20:28.905 --> 00:20:30.504
Walk slowly.

259
00:20:30.504 --> 00:20:31.714
Exhale.

260
00:20:31.714 --> 00:20:33.915
- So... - Okay then.

261
00:20:33.915 --> 00:20:35.615
When did it start?

262
00:20:35.615 --> 00:20:37.184
- Here you go. - Thank you.

263
00:20:37.415 --> 00:20:39.954
- Drink it up. - Thank you.

264
00:20:39.954 --> 00:20:41.524
This way.

265
00:20:45.825 --> 00:20:48.825
- Hi. It's someone I know. - Hello.

266
00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:51.095
- Why are you here? - My back hurts.

267
00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:53.635
- How did you hurt it? - How about some entertainment?

268
00:20:53.635 --> 00:20:56.135
Please welcome our singer, Yoo Ah Rim!

269
00:20:57.305 --> 00:20:58.875
1, 2, 3, 4.

270
00:21:02.504 --> 00:21:06.315
What's wrong with my age

271
00:21:06.744 --> 00:21:11.885
There's no age in love

272
00:21:11.984 --> 00:21:13.385
- Ma'am. - What?

273
00:21:13.385 --> 00:21:15.754
- Remember to take your medicine. - Okay.

274
00:21:15.754 --> 00:21:17.325
- You too, okay? - Okay.

275
00:21:22.095 --> 00:21:23.395
Hello, Dr. Song?

276
00:21:24.794 --> 00:21:26.294
The wrong bag?

277
00:21:26.694 --> 00:21:31.034
Yes. If there's anyone who isn't busy right now...

278
00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:34.145
Never mind. I'll go there.

279
00:21:40.115 --> 00:21:42.744
Doctor, we're going on a picnic.

280
00:21:42.915 --> 00:21:45.315
They said we can use the entire bus.

281
00:21:45.885 --> 00:21:48.585
We're going to take this all the way to Seoul.

282
00:21:48.585 --> 00:21:49.855
Lucky you.

283
00:21:52.595 --> 00:21:56.125
You're going on the picnic as planned.

284
00:21:57.694 --> 00:21:58.764
How do you feel?

285
00:21:58.764 --> 00:22:01.734
Dr. Kwak comes frequently to take care of me.

286
00:22:07.234 --> 00:22:10.105
No, I'm already on the bus.

287
00:22:11.075 --> 00:22:12.875
Yes, I'm on my way.

288
00:22:14.415 --> 00:22:15.984
Mr. Chu left already.

289
00:22:19.315 --> 00:22:21.684
Dr. Song.

290
00:22:21.885 --> 00:22:23.325
What's going on?

291
00:22:23.754 --> 00:22:26.355
Dr. Song. Dr. Song!

292
00:22:51.115 --> 00:22:53.315
Hurry. Please hurry.

293
00:22:54.855 --> 00:22:55.885
Run.

294
00:22:57.024 --> 00:22:59.754
- Hurry. - Run.

295
00:23:00.325 --> 00:23:02.925
- This way. - Over there.

296
00:23:04.194 --> 00:23:06.895
Come out. It's okay.

297
00:23:06.895 --> 00:23:08.234
It's okay.

298
00:23:08.405 --> 00:23:09.835
Dr. Song, please take her.

299
00:23:09.835 --> 00:23:12.534
Okay. It's okay.

300
00:23:14.244 --> 00:23:15.405
Oh my gosh.

301
00:23:15.875 --> 00:23:17.204
- Mommy. - It's okay.

302
00:23:19.014 --> 00:23:21.484
- Oh no. - What's going on?

303
00:23:24.615 --> 00:23:25.984
- Where does it hurt? - Here.

304
00:23:26.014 --> 00:23:27.115
Take a deep breath.

305
00:23:27.454 --> 00:23:28.484
Good.

306
00:23:31.724 --> 00:23:33.454
Okay. Hang in there.

307
00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:35.194
Where does it hurt?

308
00:23:35.964 --> 00:23:37.434
You'll be okay.

309
00:23:37.434 --> 00:23:38.895
- Mr. Seol. Are you okay? - Hey.

310
00:23:38.895 --> 00:23:41.964
Yes, I'm fine. Go treat the kids.

311
00:23:42.365 --> 00:23:43.905
Go on. Hurry.

312
00:23:45.474 --> 00:23:46.504
Dr. Song.

313
00:23:47.675 --> 00:23:49.544
- Where's the chopper? - 30 minutes away.

314
00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:50.645
A boat is an hour away.

315
00:23:50.744 --> 00:23:52.075
The triage is almost complete.

316
00:23:52.075 --> 00:23:53.675
Luckily, there aren't many in critical condition.

317
00:23:54.214 --> 00:23:56.585
Ah Rim, please give 578 a neck brace.

318
00:23:56.585 --> 00:23:57.615
- Yes, doctor. - Dr. Kwak...

319
00:23:59.014 --> 00:24:00.385
What's wrong? What is it?

320
00:24:00.585 --> 00:24:02.284
It's nothing. I think it's dislocated.

321
00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:03.555
We need to pop it back in.

322
00:24:03.555 --> 00:24:05.855
Listen to patient 23 first.

323
00:24:05.855 --> 00:24:08.395
He's struggling to breathe. Hopefully, it isn't pneumothorax.

324
00:24:08.395 --> 00:24:09.425
(Pneumothorax: collapsed lung)

325
00:24:09.425 --> 00:24:10.494
Go on.

326
00:24:15.764 --> 00:24:16.905
Let me look at your arm.

327
00:24:19.075 --> 00:24:20.105
Treat the patients first.

328
00:24:20.105 --> 00:24:21.605
You're a patient too right now.

329
00:24:22.004 --> 00:24:23.504
If you lose circulation in your arm,

330
00:24:23.504 --> 00:24:25.274
you may even lose use of your arm.

331
00:24:27.315 --> 00:24:28.315
Don't you trust me?

332
00:24:29.184 --> 00:24:30.684
- Have you done it before? - Many times.

333
00:24:32.184 --> 00:24:33.284
- Then... - It'll hurt.

334
00:24:46.764 --> 00:24:48.135
I said I've done it many times.

335
00:24:59.444 --> 00:25:01.585
Oh my gosh.

336
00:25:01.585 --> 00:25:03.415
Over here!

337
00:25:03.415 --> 00:25:04.915
- Come here! - Okay.

338
00:25:05.415 --> 00:25:08.284
- Careful. - Over here.

339
00:25:08.425 --> 00:25:09.925
Where does it hurt?

340
00:25:11.595 --> 00:25:12.595
Sir.

341
00:25:12.895 --> 00:25:15.464
I feel like my insides are all jumbled.

342
00:25:15.694 --> 00:25:17.434
I feel like vomiting.

343
00:25:17.434 --> 00:25:19.165
- Doctor. - Here.

344
00:25:20.065 --> 00:25:22.204
Doctor. Your arm...

345
00:25:22.204 --> 00:25:23.865
Let's lay you down slowly. Help me.

346
00:25:23.865 --> 00:25:24.875
Hold on.

347
00:25:24.875 --> 00:25:26.274
- Here. - Let me.

348
00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:27.305
Help me.

349
00:25:28.544 --> 00:25:30.675
It's okay. Let me see your mouth.

350
00:25:35.744 --> 00:25:36.815
Milk.

351
00:25:37.184 --> 00:25:39.754
Check every bag and see if there's any milk.

352
00:25:40.315 --> 00:25:41.325
Okay.

353
00:25:43.855 --> 00:25:44.895
There.

354
00:25:46.254 --> 00:25:47.865
- Unbutton his shirt. - Okay.

355
00:25:54.305 --> 00:25:56.135
Oh my gosh!

356
00:25:56.135 --> 00:25:57.135
Captain.

357
00:25:58.734 --> 00:26:00.105
What?

358
00:26:00.105 --> 00:26:03.204
What's wrong with my stomach?

359
00:26:04.214 --> 00:26:06.444
What happened? Is there a problem?

360
00:26:06.444 --> 00:26:07.484
Yes.

361
00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:10.784
Is it serious?

362
00:26:10.784 --> 00:26:11.954
I can't say it isn't.

363
00:26:11.954 --> 00:26:13.014
Doctor.

364
00:26:13.014 --> 00:26:16.184
Then will I die?

365
00:26:16.984 --> 00:26:18.625
Will I?

366
00:26:18.794 --> 00:26:21.165
No, you will not. Saline.

367
00:26:21.825 --> 00:26:24.395
Saving patients is what we doctors do.

368
00:26:24.694 --> 00:26:25.734
Right?

369
00:26:26.934 --> 00:26:29.504
Sir. You are extremely lucky.

370
00:26:30.105 --> 00:26:33.034
You're with a top surgeon. Take a deep breath.

371
00:26:38.575 --> 00:26:39.875
Okay, shall we begin.

372
00:26:40.885 --> 00:26:41.915
How can I help?

373
00:26:41.915 --> 00:26:44.155
We'll make an abdominal silo. Do you know what I mean?

374
00:26:44.784 --> 00:26:45.784
Let's begin.

375
00:26:47.825 --> 00:26:49.024
Hang in there.

376
00:26:51.494 --> 00:26:52.694
Hang in there.

377
00:26:52.694 --> 00:26:53.754
Here, doctor.

378
00:26:53.954 --> 00:26:55.125
- Hold the gauze. - Okay.

379
00:26:56.065 --> 00:26:57.065
Let's tape it down.

380
00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:01.065
Hang in there.

381
00:27:03.565 --> 00:27:04.575
One more.

382
00:27:08.075 --> 00:27:10.474
Give him fluids, and move him on the first transport.

383
00:27:10.474 --> 00:27:11.514
Okay.

384
00:27:12.444 --> 00:27:15.145
Hey! Come over here, and help!

385
00:27:17.014 --> 00:27:18.714
Have you seen San?

386
00:27:18.714 --> 00:27:20.454
I can't find San.

387
00:27:21.125 --> 00:27:22.484
Hurry. That way.

388
00:27:22.484 --> 00:27:23.524
Hyuk.

389
00:27:23.825 --> 00:27:26.524
- Yes? - He's not here. San isn't here.

390
00:27:28.264 --> 00:27:29.565
- San isn't here? - No.

391
00:27:33.494 --> 00:27:34.964
San. Kang San!

392
00:27:38.605 --> 00:27:39.675
San.

393
00:27:47.014 --> 00:27:48.014
No!

394
00:28:25.585 --> 00:28:28.984
(Thank you, Mr. Kim Yong Taek, for letting us use your poem.)
