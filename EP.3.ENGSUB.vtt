<i>English Subtitles by Avengers Subbing Club</i>

2
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.440
With me.

3
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.080
Don’t you want to make a deal?

4
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.380
A deal?

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.440
Yes. I want to make a deal with Madam.

6
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.680
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.520
Do you know why I’ve come into this house?

8
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.920
Revenge.

9
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.520
I want to get revenge.

10
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.760
Why are you saying such things to me?

11
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.820
I thought Madam, like me, probably would
want to get revenge.

12
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.200
So?

13
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.920
If Madam will be on my side,
I’ll leave this house after a year.

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.240
As a condition for leaving this house,
you want me to be on your side?

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.400
So, just until next year, be patient with you.

16
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.840
Would it be right if I understand it that way?

17
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.420
Yes.

18
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.520
Can you leave right now?
Yes.

19
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.760
Can you leave right now?

20
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.960
What you say isn’t enough to make a deal.

21
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.260
If you’re thinking of leaving, then before then
before it gets any later, now is the best time.

22
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.240
Even better would have been for you to
not come in here at all.

23
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.960
If I weren’t born, it would have been even better.

24
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.680
I don’t know about other things,
but what I’m sure about…

25
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.420
is that you and I do not have the kind of relationship
where we can talk about this.

26
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.900
I’m not saying that I’ll simply leave this house
or anything like that.

27
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.400
I’m going to cut all ties with my birth parents.

28
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.180
They have me as they please and don’t ever
even look in on me.

29
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.260
And now deciding to turn my life upside down

30
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.440
makes me feel really terrible!

31
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600
Until I graduate, I’m going to pretend to be a good son.

32
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.600
When I come of legal age, I’m going to slap
the back of their heads and run away.

33
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.580
The bad feelings I have about my birth parents,
Madam must have them also.

34
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.700
If I leave…

35
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.480
Then Madam will also be happy.

36
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.880
It’s not that simple an issue.
It’s a matter for adults.

37
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.420
Are you telling me to stay still
until I become an adult?

38
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.160
I don’t think I can do that.

39
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.700
Father!

40
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.400
Son!

41
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.600
Yah, the two of you have done your homework well.

42
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.720
You look very close.

43
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.160
Here!

44
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.960
What is this?

45
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.420
Start by listening to this.

46
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.000
And if you need a tutor, I’ll find one.

47
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.900
This is a tablet, isn’t it? This?

48
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.440
You know how I feel, right?

49
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.340
Of course, I know.

50
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.540
And I’ve prepared this for you.

51
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.560
Necklace?

52
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.180
Your throat is a work of art after all.

53
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.860
But they’re earrings.

54
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.420
Oh, right. Earrings.

55
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.520
It’s right that it’s a necklace.

56
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.000
Using a person, father.

57
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.660
This kid.

58
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.480
I don’t think he’s an ordinary kid.

59
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.280
Seems so. He seemed so bashful.

60
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.180
So he wants to take revenge together?

61
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.740
I oppose to that.

62
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.280
That child. He’s already been hurt by
his birth parents.

63
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.820
If he wasn’t completely turned upside down any further
by adult things, it would be better.

64
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.000
Whether that child’s words might be truth or lies.

65
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.200
It could be something that helps him though.

66
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.120
Mi Sook’s words have some value.

67
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.700
Taking a child and inserting him into these kinds of matters
is a little bit like that.

68
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.720
Hiding out true intentions and pretending to help him
is also just using the child.

69
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.040
For me, that child is unfortunate and pitiable.

70
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.100
Of course, your position must be difficult as well.

71
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.440
What is his personality like?

72
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.400
Let’s see…

73
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.480
How should I put it?

74
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.600
Don’t push me from the back.

75
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.020
If I also roll and fall down the staircase,
then what will you do?

76
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.640
Who pushed whom anyway?
He just fell down by himself.

77
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.780
You saw that, but you just left,
didn’t you?

78
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.340
Yah, if no one had discovered it and something bad
had happened to him,

79
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.760
then someone would have been charged
for committing death.

80
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.180
Do you know that?

81
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.360
Become a case? Whatever.

82
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.260
He by himself got caught in the trash can and fell,
so why would the law be interested?

83
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.880
Also, rather than being charged for causing death,

84
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.840
it would probably be a charge for committing murder.

85
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.620
I know that, too!

86
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.420
Aigoo. Since the smell of trash is mixing with the
fishy smells of fish...

87
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.320
Yah. Yah. Vomit. Vomit.

88
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.560
It’s really coming out. Oh. Yah.

89
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.920
Hey, fish cafe!

90
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.340
Yah, in order to pay the settlement money,
your mother must have had to work hard.

91
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.980
If the settlement money is $5,000,
then how many fish do you have to sell?

92
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.660
Wow, did you receive $5,000?
Then you have to buy a round, jerk!

93
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.220
What are you saying?

94
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.520
Look at him ignoring us.
Look at him.

95
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.580
Hey, why don’t you hit me once as well?

96
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.620
Yah, yah, yah. He…

97
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.480
Doesn’t have a dad, mom sells fish at the market,
so he wasn’t able to receive proper family training…

98
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.220
Yah, Hwang Jung Wook!

99
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.280
Yah, yah. You’re going to hit me?
You’re going to hit me? Hit me? Aigoo.

100
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.380
I’ll throw it away for you.

101
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.380
Aigoo. Why don’ t you try hitting my ear
this time?

102
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.840
Yah! Aish!

103
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.380
Yah! Aish!

104
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.720
You bastard!

105
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.160
It’s the third floor.

106
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.840
You bastard.
Just wait right there.

107
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.600
Thank you.

108
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.900
Crazy.

109
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.840
Where do I have to put these away?

110
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.880
I can’t tell what kind of kid he is.

111
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.260
Where is he?

112
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.900
Yah.
Haven’t you seen a jerk with a pail?

113
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.680
Whoever the bastard is,
I’ll chase him to hell.

114
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.320
For this much, you should be thankful.

115
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.520
Rather than being the culprit,
you were the accomplice.

116
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.740
It was just because it would have been bothersome
to have gotten involved.

117
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.620
So would you get lost, too?

118
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.660
Anyway, I think not getting entangled with him
would be a good thing.

119
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.580
I just wonder whether we would just be betrayed
at some point as well.

120
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.560
Anyway, he’s a child.
One who needs his parents.

121
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.760
I think I know now.

122
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.820
To be honest, the kid is a kid.
However...

123
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.360
Jung Hye, I’m more worried about you.

124
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.100
The money you gave to Hee Soo,
if you don’t take it back...

125
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.960
Then we can’t take even a step forward together.

126
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.740
If a person is caught up by money,

127
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.460
Then becoming a monster takes only a second.

128
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.380
Yes, hurry and take it.

129
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.180
Take it. Here.

130
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.900
In the future, I can’t even give Hee Soo
any spending money?

131
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.320
Just enough to buy ramen.

132
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.580
$500?

133
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.320
We three...

134
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.640
Going forward, we’ll be okay,
won’t we?

135
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.840
Yah, Lee Soo Gyum! Why aren’t you staying for the
late study session?

136
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.860
I’m studying until my nose bleeds at home.

137
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.520
That nosebleed, I can wash it off for you.

138
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.960
Jeez.

139
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.660
Why are you here again?

140
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.620
The water shower just a while ago, that was you,
wasn’t it, Hyung?

141
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.940
Is that right?

142
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.620
Would you like to eat some bread?

143
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.620
Do you think that I just eat bread every day?

144
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.560
Then something else?

145
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.460
Why don’t you just compete a round
with your brother?

146
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.760
Depending on the score, that will decide
who is the older brother.

147
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.580
Aigoo, older brother!

148
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.900
Hey, is your mother in a club or something?

149
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.700
A club?

150
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.220
She won’t even go to a health club because
she doesn’t want to spend the money.

151
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.240
Oh, is that right?

152
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.080
By the way, what did you say you put in
that ramen you were going to make?

153
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:52.960
Yes?

154
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.520
That time, didn’t you say that you would
make me ramen, didn’t you?

155
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.920
Enjoy your drink.

156
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.540
Hong Do, change a thousand won for me?

157
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.280
Who are they?

158
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.000
Why are you so curious about everything?

159
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.160
Don’t use it as an excuse to talk.

160
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.820
Go already.

161
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.200
Unnie!

162
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.360
Oh, put it on the tab.

163
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.500
Oh! Fine!

164
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.640
Bye.

165
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.560
I’ve decided.

166
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.080
Revenge. I’m not going to do it with him.

167
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.680
And, it could be dangerous for our Avengers Club as well.

168
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.120
Mom!

169
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.560
Hee Soo!

170
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.460
I thought you said you were going to go straight home.
Did you forget your key?

171
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.760
That’s not it. Mom, this is that senior that
I mentioned to you.

172
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.160
Hello.
My name is Lee Soo Gyum.

173
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.100
That time. Me. Staircase. 119.

174
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.280
Oh! Oh, my word!
Aigoo. Aigoo Just a second.

175
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.820
I’ve heard so much about you from Hee Soo.
Student Soo Gyum, thank you.

176
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.220
Oh. I smell fishy so I had better not.

177
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.820
That’s okay!

178
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.980
However, looking at it now,
Hee Soo has taken after you a lot.

179
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.160
That’s right, isn’t it?
It’s a relief that he took after me.

180
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.740
Sit, sit, sit.

181
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.680
No, that’s fine.

182
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.320
That’s okay. Sit, sit, sit.

183
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.940
Ajumma. Hello.

184
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.080
Yes, hello.

185
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.360
That ajumma is also mom’s friend.

186
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.920
Ah. Hello.

187
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.540
Yes. You must be Hee Soo.

188
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.660
Yes.

189
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.120
Ajumma’s friend.

190
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.540
The three of you look very good together.

191
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.940
That’s right, don’t we?

192
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.920
We look like the Three Beautiful Maidens of Fate,
don’t we?

193
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.800
Can you give me some ingredients to make ramen?

194
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.260
Okay. Fine.

195
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.360
I’m going to go.

196
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.300
What? You’re going already?

197
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.240
I also…

198
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.260
Goodbye.

199
00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.340
Spending money.

200
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.920
Thank you.

201
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.380
Goodbye.

202
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.380
I’ve returned!

203
00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.120
Oh, Student Soo Gyum, you’ve come.
Have dinner!

204
00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.940
Hasn’t Madam had her dinner yet?

205
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.840
She says that she doesn’t want any.
I think she’s feeling very sensitive right now.

206
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.160
Sit.

207
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.140
I will also skip dinner today.
I’m not very hungry.

208
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.480
It’s very hard, isn’t it?

209
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.640
Thanks to you, ajumma, it’s okay.

210
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.700
Go ahead and go home now.
I’ll let them know.

211
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.100
Thank you. Thank you.

212
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.340
I wondered whether we were just going
to be betrayed somehow anyway.

213
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.160
I’ve brought the evening meal I prepared.

214
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.060
What is a family? Isn’t it eating meals together?

215
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.800
Do you think that we’re a family?

216
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.440
It’s seafood ramen. I’ve tried making it with the ingredients
that Hee Soo’s mom gave us.

217
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.820
My request, have you thought about it some?

218
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.480
I’m not making any deals with you.

219
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.780
Then let’s not make any deals.
Let’s just become closer.

220
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.020
Let’s become closer, us.

221
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.000
Fine. Let’s make a deal.

222
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.320
I’ll go ahead and wait until next year,
so you just have to not do that thing.

223
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.600
Becoming closer.

224
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.060
Mom!

225
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.360
Hee Soo!

226
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.560
Oh! Hee Kyung!

227
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.060
Noona, did you leave your home?

228
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.180
I’ve come home, kid.

229
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.200
What is going on?

230
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.340
I’m having too hard a time.

231
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.480
Dinner?

232
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.300
I’ve eaten.

233
00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.900
Mother!

234
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.840
Little brother!

235
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.520
I…

236
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.900
have finally gotten a job!

237
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.580
A job?

238
00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.260
A job?

239
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.020
I’m going to start my life as a high school
physical education teacher!

240
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.260
Of course, only as a contract employee.

241
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.880
However, I’ll just attend for a while and see if
this is the job that fits me well, and see how it goes.

242
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.020
Surely not my school?

243
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.960
That’s my alma mater as well.

244
00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.280
Oh, that’s well done.
Oh, my daughter!

245
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.020
Mom.

246
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.200
My daughter!
You did well, my daughter!

247
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.660
I’m going to buy everything for you.
Buy everything.

248
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.040
She had said she wanted to study longer
for the exams…

249
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.500
Seo Yeon, are you sleeping?

250
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.000
[Name tag: Baek Seo Jin]

251
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.950
<i> I rather envy Baek Seo Jin.</i>

252
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.410
What on earth are you?

253
00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.430
Don't you understand the deal condition?

254
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:56.960
We won't get closer. We never pretend to be close.
We can't never be close.

255
00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.850
It's nothing like that...

256
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.400
Don't dare to come into my room.
Don't dare to touch my belongings.

257
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.190
You don't allow family do this?

258
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.340
Get out.

259
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.760
Get out right now.

260
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.350
Aish!

261
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.120
Hee Kyung.

262
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.950
The social life is...

263
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.010
Endure, endure then endure.

264
00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.700
Even if it's disgusting, dirty, shameful,
I should endure and endure.

265
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.600
You will fill 100 times, mother.

266
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.230
I'm worried too, Noona.
Keep your temper, Um?

267
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.310
- Aigoo you just...
- Ah...

268
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:08.590
You're doing this, so this mom...

269
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.920
- I'm going to school...
- I'm going to school.

270
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.750
She may kill the kid.

271
00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:23.710
Young master went out early in the morning.

272
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.050
Yes.

273
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.640
Principal, this is the temporary P.E. teacher
working from today.

274
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.940
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Hee Kyung.

275
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.050
Nice to meet you.

276
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:15.080
Aigoo, our teacher Kim looks more like a dance teacher
than a P.E. teacher.

277
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.200
I majored Taekwondo.

278
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.560
Ahh.. Taekwondo?

279
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.560
Aigoo..

280
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.750
that's why it's so solid. Um?

281
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.500
Please treat me right.

282
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.850
If you're doing hard, you can be a real teacher.

283
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.250
Our foundation is flexible in that side.

284
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.720
Teacher Kim graduated from our school, Mr. Principal.

285
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.160
Ah did you?

286
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.800
Then I should take more care of you. Um?

287
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.050
Really nice to see you.

288
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.280
Yes. I'll do my best.

289
00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.920
Congratulations.

290
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:31.950
Congratulations on your first going to work.

291
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.570
Teacher Kim Hee Kyung, congratulations
on your first going to work.

292
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.410
Thanks.

293
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.160
Tada!

294
00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:09.290
- Aigoo, why do you even tear with this?
- We touched her too much?

295
00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.290
Was it too much? Aigoo.

296
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.040
Mom...

297
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.040
Hee Soo...

298
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.520
What happened to you?
Hee Kyung?

299
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.680
I think I will be fired.

300
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:26.680
Huh?

301
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.500
Fighting...

302
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.900
How do you feel about this?

303
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.000
Isn't the mood good being in our school?

304
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.250
Right. The mood wasn't like this when I came at first.

305
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.320
Principal, have one more glass.
You've worked hard today.

306
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.010
To whom shall I give this glass?

307
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.330
Here, Teacher Park.

308
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.760
One shot. Come on, come on.

309
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.720
One shot. Come on, come on.

310
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.080
To the bottom.

311
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.520
Ah hot. Ah hot.

312
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.540
What to do?

313
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.050
- Teacher Kim, what are you doing?
- What to do?

314
00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.840
Ah how much he felt hot.

315
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.950
- Hot, hot, hot.
- What are you doing!

316
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.950
Where is that bastard?

317
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.420
- Mom..
- Let's go together, Mom.

318
00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.330
Why are you leaping too? Ah, Mom.

319
00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.950
Hey, Where is that bastard's home.
Lead me quickly.

320
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.950
How would I know that?

321
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.560
How about you?

322
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.950
Don't know either...

323
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.930
Aww Mom, you told me to endure.

324
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.450
It's nothing to endure.

325
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.600
Those garbage should be removed right now.

326
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.200
Taekwondo should be used for that moment.

327
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.000
You should have broken his limbs to pieces.

328
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Then my life should be broken to pieces too!

329
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:03.610
Ah.

330
00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:15.600
Ah.

331
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.640
You guys trust mom, right?

332
00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.000
[Do Hee Unnie:  Urgent meeting]

333
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.350
You just came back from business trip.

334
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.350
Then you work till night again.

335
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.290
Aren't you keeping your wife too lonely?

336
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.130
- Aigoo, she isn't the person who knows that kind of thing.
- Right...

337
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:28.000
A wife is for ornamental.
Don't touch, just look.

338
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.920
It is, right?

339
00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.870
Professor Baek's home looks different.

340
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.840
- Is there some touch?
- Ah.

341
00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.720
No such thing.

342
00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.720
Then let's say so.

343
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.900
Director Lee is shining glossily.

344
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.150
Maybe you had no moment to feel lonely
during your business trip?

345
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.400
It's said that the women there are that
much pretty, right?

346
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.150
Aigoo. My schedule was too tight, I had no spare time.
I couldn't even get a glimpse.

347
00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.000
Then why did you go there?

348
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.410
Oh right, how is your son?

349
00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.040
Yeah, well, he’s going alright.

350
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.650
Perhaps it’s because he takes after me,

351
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:09.320
but he is doing well in his studies and I think
he’s able to get along with people.

352
00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.120
A piece of luck is a lucky piece, huh?

353
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.760
Professor Baek, what happened with the obstacles
at the school?

354
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.930
Before I declared my candidacy,
I worked it out, of course.

355
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.200
If there is something I can do to help,

356
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.680
just let me know any time.

357
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
In that case, how do you feel about
doing an event

358
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.480
where you meet directly with the parents
of the students?

359
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.330
Good idea.

360
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.330
I had better talk you up with..

361
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.970
- ..the “nellies”.
- The “nellies”?

362
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.970
Oh. You don’t know “nellies”?

363
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.900
Neighborhood ladies who only help me.

364
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:48.640
Hong Sang Man was my teacher in high school.
We called him Pervert Hong.

365
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.390
Oh, my goodness.

366
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.400
Aigoo, bastard.

367
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.200
How should I deal with him?

368
00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.780
How about reporting him?

369
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.800
I thought about it, too.

370
00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.010
But hearing what Hee Kyung's story...

371
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.330
There's no legal way to deal with.

372
00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.480
And there is no evidence.
If he pretended not to know, it becomes nothing.

373
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:11.880
Ooooooh!!!

374
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:13.290
Aigoo!

375
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.280
How about this?

376
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.920
Since he is easily seduced…

377
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.390
We trap him then collect the evidence?

378
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.750
He'll recognize Mi Sook Unnie’s and my faces, so we can’t.

379
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.720
The only one possible is…

380
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:33.850
Me?

381
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.520
Neighborhood lady?

382
00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.640
Do you think I can seduce him?

383
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:10.670
I think we should follow the standard procedure so it won't
happen anymore in the future.

384
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.020
Report to the Ministry of Education...

385
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.660
and request the investigation.

386
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.530
We can also gather the parents, and then…
- Ah, w-wait, wait a minute.

387
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.950
Before we can succeed,
that person will die of old age.

388
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.650
Should we just cut *it* off?

389
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.200
Tools? Does just anyone use them?

390
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.200
A method which leaves wounds are not allowed.

391
00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:08.280
That’s right. It’s not our method.

392
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.040
How should I erase this trash?

393
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.260
Oooh!! I’m so furious!

394
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:20.000
He said that he’s our husbands’ senior,
right?

395
00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.080
Really? That’s how you’re all connected?

396
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.480
Then, should we look into it more?

397
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.450
Let’s think of a plan separately,
and meet again later.

398
00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.880
Unnie, I know that you must feel
the world is unfair,

399
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.610
but let’s look for the right solution together.

400
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.020
I won’t let him go.

401
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:50.590
Thank you. Thank you.

What do you mean whose?
This land’s owner, of course.

Surely, you haven’t left the Buam-dong house?

Who are those people!

424
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:46.700
Shhh...

425
00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:51.900
It’s just…

426
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.700
It’s just that Byung Soo has some interest in it.

427
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.050
So, I told him to take a look around it.

428
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:57.850
With whose permission?!

429
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.200
I said to not touch the house or the mountain, didn’t I?

430
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:08.150
No matter how much you say that you’re going to inherit,

and you’re just a minor.

432

Oh you, in the future we’re going to have so much,
so why do you care about some country land like this?

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.550
Do you know what day today is?

434
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.250
What day is it?

435
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:28.950
Is it your birthday?

436
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.700
I thought that I had you on a cold day.

437
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.150
- Come this way. This way.
- Yes.

438
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.550
- Careful.
- Yes.

439
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.400
I said leave immediately!

Yah! You bastard!

- Yes, okay.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.860
- Is Seo Yeon doing well in school?
- Of course.

445
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:23.260
Her father might be elected to the Board of Education,
so it wouldn’t do if the child is a mess.

446
00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:29.020
Ah, Seo Yeon's principal is going to have

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:32.840
- Principal Hong Sang Man?
- Yes.

448
00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:34.510
Whoa, your memory is good...

449
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.890
- When you announced your candidacy, we met him then.
- Ahh... that's right.

450
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.330
Since that gentleman has said that
he’ll help campaign for me,

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.590
I think you should go to the meeting and
greet the other parents.

452
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.190
Meeting in person is important.  
You know what I mean, right?

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.230
I understand.

in front of the parents.

461
00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.810
I know it’s a good opportunity to embarrass him
in front of many people,

462
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.210
but I think it will be too burdensome for us.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:38.990
You’re right.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.430
But I don’t feel right about you guys

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.400
I’m his guardian.

480
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.230
He doesn't seem to know you.

481
00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:01.320
Well...this kid, he's not in his right mind.

482
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.060
You.

483
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.880
Do you want to upset your dad?

484
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.810
Imagine how worried your dad is about you,
waiting for you.

485
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.110
For such well you know,

486
00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.140
Did you make Grandma wait for 18 years?

487
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:29.180
Do whatever you want!

488
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:33.960
Excuse me, you're right,
he beat up these guys up.

489
00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.250
I just have to give a victim’s statement, right?

490
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.170
Over here?

491
00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.630
It doesn't have to be a guardian.

492
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.430
In situations like this, there must be someone
you can call?

493
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.820
I could've gone alone.

494
00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.630
You can’t. You don’t know what will happen.
Based on what you said,

495
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.500
It doesn’t seem like an easy problem.
So we can't let you go alone.

496
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.480
Do you know what's this thing
at the police substation?

497
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.680
I hope it’s nothing big.

498
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:29.150
But...

499
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.000
It looks like we are going somewhere far.

500
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.480
We can go back by dinner time right?

501
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.910
How about 8 PM?

502
00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:43.960
10 PM?

503
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.410
12 AM?

504
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.050
Ah, It feels nice.

505
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.790
Avengers Club…

506
00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.050
Fighting!

507
00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.040
Omo, look.  It's falling.

508
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.240
Aigoo...

509
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.980
You trust me, right?

510
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.100
Aigoo...

511
00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.430
Oh, Mister. Mister… ohh!

512
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.330
Oh. Anyone, stop! Omona!

513
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.060
- Ah, why?
- Why?

514
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.240
Smelly…

515
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:53.640
Then do you prefer to ride an open car
in this kind of situation?

516
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:58.280
Well, yes...

517
00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.800
Well, okay.... the view is nice, the air is great...

518
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:14.860
Ah, I want to go plaaaaaaay!

519
00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.010
Soo Gyum, why are you here?

520
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.660
Mother, please come and sign here.

521
00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.130
Me?

522
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.150
Next time, tell me where you're going.    

523
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.870
Or else get into a fight closer to home.

524
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.050
I don’t know if it’s okay to just sit here
like this!

525
00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.590
Ah, there's nothing to do anyway.

526
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.150
I just picked some random things from the garden
and made soup.

527
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.360
Oh, this is a proper feast!

528
00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.200
Oh, let’s see.

529
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:41.920
Hmm! Oh, it’s delicious!
Oh, what in the world!

530
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:51.550
It’s delicious.

531
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.400
You must have some recipe secrets.

532
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.180
Oh, I really like squash leaf wraps.

533
00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:08.360
Oh, there isn’t any meat though.

534
00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.350
Still, this is so good.

535
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.360
I ate well (Thank you).

536
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:19.400
This is the first time I’ve eaten a meal
prepared for me by someone else.

537
00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.050
Is there anything that you’re lacking?

538
00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.920
You’re good-looking, your personality is good,
you have a tender hea…

539
00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:27.320
You don’t have to call home?

540
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:28.960
Oh!

541
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:35.390
I’m at the hospital.

542
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.360
I think I’m going to be late...
- Oh, it's mom.

543
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.480
So make sure you eat the dishes in the refrigerator.
- I'm out with friends.

544
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.580
You’re not going to call?
- Go ahead and sleep first.

545
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.580
He won’t notice that I haven’t gone home yet.

546
00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.030
I might not be able to get home tonight.

547
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.030
Right.
- Yes.

548
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:51.310
- I’ll clean up and bring some dessert.
- No! No!

549
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.450
- Let’s do it together. Together.
- No, that’s not necessary.

550
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:54.840
Oh, let’s do it together.

551
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:56.460
Careful, careful.

552
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:03.650
<i>- Aigoo, I’ll do it. Ai.
- Ai, ai. it’s okay. </i>

553
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:11.250
<i> Unnie, just go rest.
-Aigoo, aigoo, let me do it. Aigoo. What are you doing?
Go rest. Aigoo. No.</i>

554
00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.380
Omona, look at how nicely he’s cut up the apples.

555
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.800
I’ll eat it well.

556
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.780
Oh, I have to say what needs to be said.

557
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.810
Our Soo Gyum...

558
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.360
I’m not saying this just because he saved
my Hee Soo...

559
00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.210
But just by looking at him...

560
00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.600
One can tell that he was raised by his grandparents well.

561
00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.300
Don't you think so?

562
00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.300
Ah, yes.

563
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.500
If I you think I’m okay.

564
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:55.880
Please include me.

565
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.000
Include where?

566
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:01.230
Avengers Club.

567
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.790
It looks like a fun club.

568
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:09.720
Please let me join.

569
00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.210
W-w-what are you talking about?

570
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.700
The three members who are sitting here

571
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:16.200
and the objects of the revenge

572
00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:17.160
Hwang Jung Wook

573
00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.000
and Madam’s husband...

574
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.680
...my real father.

575
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.820
Did you have me investigated?

576
00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:22.960
Would I have done that?

577
00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.920
I coincidentally overheard it.

578
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.020
I’ve decided.

579
00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.410
I won’t seek revenge together with him.

580
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.580
And, it could be dangerous for
our Avengers Club.

581
00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:34.170
Mom!

582
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:36.200
Oh, Hee Soo!

583
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:41.900
If you’re going to get revenge on my father,

584
00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.330
I think I’ll be of help.

585
00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:45.850
No, you can’t.

586
00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.720
Why?
It would be beneficial for both of us.

587
00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:51.000
Soo Gyum, this is a matter for adults.

588
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:52.600
That’s right, you can’t. This...

589
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:55.480
It’s something that has to be done
in secret anyway.

590
00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.350
and we agreed that we wouldn’t add any more
members, and also…

591
00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.840
I can also work secretly!

592
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:03.440
- And, increasing it just by one member...
- Only women are allowed in.

593
00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:06.430
- Oh,yes.
- Oh, yes, that's right.

594
00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:12.220
Why are you laughing?

595
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:14.030
It’s nothing.

596
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:16.800
Ah, it was a condition that I didn’t even think of.

597
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.320
Truthfully.

598
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:26.680
I made a deal with my real mom.

599
00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.440
If I go and live in Father’s house,

600
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.400
she’ll leave this house and land alone.

601
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.240
However, that deal was broken.

602
00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:38.480
I can’t wait until next year.

603
00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:42.720
I wanted to become a useless child
to my real parents

604
00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.560
but that won’t be enough.

605
00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.160
I'm going to make him regret

606
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:50.480
taking me in.

607
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:54.300
So that I can protect this place, please help me.

608
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.500
Let’s to it together... revenge.

609
00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.750
You make sure to protect this house.

610
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:05.240
We’ll do the revenge instead.

611
00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.260
He's not coming?

612
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.600
I'll go and get him.

613
00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.440
Until I get revenge, I'll stay in Seoul.

614
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:33.950
I won't come back here.

615
00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.520
Excuse me.

616
00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.640
Hello. Do you remember me?

617
00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:01.610
Yes, we do.

618
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.180
Then what happened to the kid?

619
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:07.000
Was he?

620
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:08.410
Taken away?

621
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.900
His mom came for him.

622
00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:12.400
And so did his aunts.
The three of them came together.

623
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.070
But I'm his mom.

624
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:16.400
What are you talking about?

625
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.310
- I don't think this is his mom.
- I agree.

626
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:22.080
I'm his mom.

627
00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:23.100
I don't think so.

628
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.150
But I'm his mother!

629
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.640
No way, could it be that woman?

630
00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:00.620
Do you think we can do this ourselves?

631
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:02.440
We already bought it.

632
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:05.180
Jung Hye, can we do this?

633
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:07.960
It's an academic event.

634
00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.400
We have to.

635
00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:11.880
It's our Avengers Club's mission.

636
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:14.300
Right, right. Us, together.

637
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:16.080
Avenger's Club.

638
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:17.260
Fighting!

639
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:39.350
So why did they decide to hold this event today?

640
00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:40.620
Who knows.

641
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.880
They don’t expect even 10% participation.

642
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.330
If they’re going to do it, then they should do it properly.

643
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:09.330
Teacher Kim Hee Kyoung.

644
00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:11.310
Yes.

645
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.730
Today your outfit is a bit…

646
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:19.840
I’ll be running together with the kids
so I thought this will be more comfortable.

647
00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.260
Still today, we will have important guests...

648
00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:28.930
Hmm, that’s good, I have something
I’d like you to do.

649
00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.040
Okay.

650
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:33.130
Once you are done with the task I give you
let’s go eat.

651
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:38.420
The doengjang soup like the last time was quite
delicious, wasn’t it?

652
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:29.260
Ow! Mom!

653
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.350
What are you doing out here?

654
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.350
What would I be doing?

655
00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.130
I’m doing one of the things that
my job requires me to do.

656
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:40.530
Stop immediately.
Just quit it all!

657
00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.310
Oh, it’s okay, mom.

658
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.710
That bastard told you to do it,
didn’t he?

659
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:49.860
That petty bastard.
Today, you’re going to die and I’m going to die.

660
00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.080
Oh, mom! Mom! Mom!

661
00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.680
I want to keep working here.

662
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:56.640
Whatever you say, is it harder than
it is for mom?

663
00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.640
I also want to be of help to mom.

664
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:04.600
Mom raised you wrong.

665
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.510
A child is not supposed to worry
about her parents.

666
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:16.400
She’s just supposed to look at the path
that she has to go.

667
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.750
Eh… you should have at least worn a hat.

668
00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.020
Done.

669
00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:34.550
- We're done right?
- Done.

670
00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:29.330
Hurry! Hurry!

671
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:39.640
Aigoo… Miss Jung Hye.

672
00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:44.110
No, that’s not it. Should I be calling you
Soo Gyum’s Mother now?

673
00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:46.080
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

674
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:51.000
Whenever I see you…
you are really always the same.

675
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.680
Whatever. Now, I’ve aged a lot.

676
00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:04.220
If we keep doing this, we might knock our
wisdom teeth together.

677
00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.820
Aigoo. Isn’t it Professor Baek’s wife?

678
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:22.600
You came early.

679
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.130
Today, please take care of me well.

680
00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:28.680
Ah, yes.

681
00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.880
On your hand, this dust is…
it’s really not coming off.

682
00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:42.330
I told you to clean this place well.

683
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:43.860
I did do that.

684
00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:47.600
Since there is still some time left, why don’t we go to
the principal’s office, and have a cup of tea.

685
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.110
Ah, yes.

686
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:50.420
Let’s go.

687
01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:30.880
Hello, hello. Oh, Min Wo's mom! Finally, you are here.
Come out more often.

688
01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.880
Hello.

689
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.730
Oh, hello.

690
01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:38.570
- Hello. Let’s see each other often.
-Yes.

691
01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:44.880
Hello. Hello.

692
01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.370
The seat is taken.

693
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:52.770
I know the seat is there that’s why I sat in it.

694
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.440
There is someone sitting there.
<i>**(The seat has an owner.)</i>

695
01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.930
Owner my foot…
If I sat down then it’s mine.

696
01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:01.750
They will come later and you will
have to move back.

697
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:03.600
Don’t you know who I am?

698
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:08.930
This was originally my seat, student parents' representative,
the person closest to the principal.

699
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:10.400
Don’t you know?

700
01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:12.400
Jong Wook's mom.

701
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.840
Oh yes, Mr. principal.

702
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.930
I’m sorry but could you move another seat.

703
01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:20.800
I.. I..

704
01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.880
We are not that close to be sitting next to each other.

705
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:38.220
She must not even have any pride.

706
01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.480
She’s even pretending to be Chairman Hong’s family.

707
01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.910
- Really?
- Yes.

708
01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:57.970
That is why…

709
01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:59.660
what I want to say is

710
01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:03.130
our principal who is always willing to work with us

711
01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:07.880
students’ parents is really always to be respected.

712
01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.820
For those fine words, thank you.

713
01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.930
The reason that I have gathered everyone at this event…

714
01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.440
Do you have something you want to say?

715
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:28.550
Not too long ago, there was news that a principal who
compromised a student was sent to jail, wasn’t there?

716
01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:30.080
Whether our school is safe…

717
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.840
Kim Hee Soo’s mother!

718
01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.910
How could you ask such an inappropriate question
of our principal?

719
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:37.110
It’s because I had heard some stories,
that’s why!

720
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.840
Principal.

721
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:28.060
Now, now, now.

722
01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.420
What is the point of getting worked up about something

723
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.350
that happened at another school, parents?

724
01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:35.970
Anyway, in the upcoming elections,

725
01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:39.460
that one of our student’s parents
is going to be a candidate,

726
01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.330
did you know that?

727
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:46.130
Today, at this event, the candidate’s wife…

728
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:50.080
Ah, yes. She has stood up.

729
01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.510
The two persons…

730
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:53.480
I...

731
01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:56.860
have something to say.

732
01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:59.170
Yes, please do so.
That would be good.

733
01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:01.420
In this place,

734
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.860
To Principal Hong Sang Man,

735
01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.280
there is something that I have to say to him.

736
01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.970
To me? What?

737
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:25.130
Just a moment. Sorry.
Just a moment.

738
01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:37.930
Are you okay?

739
01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:41.150
Oh, this looks like glue.

740
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.150
Please help!

741
01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:49.080
<i>- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?</i>

742
01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.240
Oh, principal!

743
01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:59.170
Principal, perhaps you should just take off
your trousers?

744
01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:01.240
Hey! Take my pants off?

745
01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:09.200
I have to quickly…

746
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.930
Let’s go. Let’s go.

747
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:15.280
9-1-1.
Call 119!

748
01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.730
What do we do?

749
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:23.310
Oh, principal! What to do?!
Oh, principal!

750
01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.680
One. Two. Three.

751
01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:03.930
<i>Just know that this isn’t the end,
you bug-like son of a dog.</i>

752
01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:07.730
<i>Just think if your family suffered
the same things.</i>

753
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:12.860
<i>Your memorable past is not forgotten.
Of course, with evidence.</i>

754
01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:16.510
<i>To be continued. BJ
***(stands for Bok Ja Club aka Avengers Club)</i>

755
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:18.910
BJ? What is it?

756
01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:09.680
Okay, now...

757
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:14.660
shall we really start?
