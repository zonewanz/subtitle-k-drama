1
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.125
Mom.

2
00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:11.294
Why did you call her Ji An, Mom?

3
00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:12.829
This is me.

4
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.935
Why did you tell Hae Ja this is Ji An?

5
00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:21.104
Isn't this me?

6
00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:25.208
It is you.

7
00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:28.812
This is me, right?

8
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.548
Then why did you say it's Ji An?

9
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.352
I...

10
00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:39.990
switched you and Ji An.

11
00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:42.993
What... What did you say?

12
00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:46.163
I'm sorry, Ji Soo.

13
00:00:47.364 --> 00:00:48.432
I sent Ji An...

14
00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:52.536
instead of you.

15
00:00:53.737 --> 00:00:55.305
I did so because of my greed.

16
00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:58.575
It wasn't Ji An.

17
00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:01.344
It was you.

18
00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:18.328
When did I say it was Ji An?

19
00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:21.998
I never said that. You heard it wrong.

20
00:01:22.032 --> 00:01:25.535
No. She said it's Ji An.

21
00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:28.205
Hae Ja's mistaken.

22
00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:31.441
I just didn't say anything 
because she rushed in.

23
00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:33.477
Then why were you crying 
looking at my picture?

24
00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:37.581
- What? - I heard you crying.

25
00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:39.616
I came back to get my cell phone...

26
00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:41.284
before Hae Ja was here.

27
00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:43.587
You kept crying.

28
00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:47.090
That's...

29
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:50.727
I wasn't crying...

30
00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.430
looking at your picture.

31
00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:55.832
Sometimes,

32
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:59.870
I just feel like crying.

33
00:02:01.238 --> 00:02:02.839
At my age, people cry...

34
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.476
even by watching leaves fall in the rain.

35
00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:09.112
I'm in menopause.

36
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.148
Liar.

37
00:02:13.984 --> 00:02:16.286
You cried because you miss Ji An.

38
00:02:20.857 --> 00:02:22.459
Did you cry...

39
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.162
in secret every day?

40
00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:29.132
Don't be upset.

41
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:33.703
She's doing better in a rich family.

42
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.540
You saw how well she's doing last time.

43
00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:40.243
You're right.

44
00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:46.249
Did you cry because...

45
00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:48.051
I missed Ji An so much?

46
00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:51.054
Is that why you cried looking 
at my picture?

47
00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.523
You said...

48
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.793
you should be at work
 before customers arrive.

49
00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:58.128
You're right.

50
00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:02.032
I couldn't leave because 
you were crying so much.

51
00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.135
Then is this left-handed 
girl my dead sister?

52
00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:07.304
Is she the real Ji An? And is this me?

53
00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.407
You're late. Hurry up.

54
00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:14.110
- I have to leave too. Go. - Okay.

55
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:15.779
See you later.

56
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.098
Eun Seok.

57
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.666
Yes.

58
00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:38.368
What are your plans for today?

59
00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:42.906
I have an English speaking lesson at 10...

60
00:03:44.608 --> 00:03:48.945
But I can speak English.

61
00:03:50.113 --> 00:03:51.414
It's phonics.

62
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:53.683
You didn't learn English from abroad.

63
00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.418
You need to fix your pronunciation.

64
00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:57.354
I see.

65
00:03:58.788 --> 00:04:01.825
I have a manners lesson from 2pm to 4pm.

66
00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:04.427
Then have dinner outside with me tonight.

67
00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:07.230
You should wait...

68
00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:10.567
until Father comes back.

69
00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:13.303
I'll tell Mr. Yang...

70
00:04:13.303 --> 00:04:15.605
to train her until the evening.

71
00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.675
What for? She's already studying all day.

72
00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:20.877
It's not good manners 
to do her own stuff...

73
00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:23.780
while answering an adult's question...

74
00:04:24.147 --> 00:04:25.548
just like she did now.

75
00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:27.217
Father's returning soon.

76
00:04:27.217 --> 00:04:29.519
I can't let him see her 
being rude like this.

77
00:04:30.287 --> 00:04:33.456
It's not easy to change 
her habits by studying.

78
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:35.659
She still has enough time.

79
00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:38.094
It's not enough to get
 rid of the bad habits...

80
00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:39.596
she had for 25 years.

81
00:04:45.402 --> 00:04:48.838
You'll be working as a regular employee...

82
00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:50.974
at Haesung Apparel's Marketing Team.

83
00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:53.343
Haesung Apparel?

84
00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:56.646
Honey, we agreed to ask about her opinion first.

85
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.481
The chairman confirmed it.

86
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.022
I heard you always wanted to be a regular employee.

87
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:08.958
Yes.

88
00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:12.395
Why do you want her in the Marketing Team?

89
00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.298
We've already registered our DNA.

90
00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.534
Your parents recently told you...

91
00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:21.037
the secret behind your birth,

92
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:24.607
so you registered your DNA yourself...

93
00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:26.042
to find your real parents.

94
00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:31.047
We found each other in December.

95
00:05:31.715 --> 00:05:33.850
That's why we will reveal you to the public...

96
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.418
at our company's 40th anniversary.

97
00:05:36.152 --> 00:05:37.520
Before we do that,

98
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.523
don't you think it'd be better if you were...

99
00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:42.459
working at the Marketing Team of our company?

100
00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:47.530
I don't think I understand what you mean by that.

101
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.467
We wanted to introduce you as soon as we found you.

102
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.168
But if that happens,

103
00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:55.538
the public and the press will gossip about us.

104
00:05:55.972 --> 00:05:57.841
That includes you and our company.

105
00:06:00.477 --> 00:06:02.045
Until then, you must become...

106
00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:06.049
someone that everyone recognizes as one of us.

107
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.418
But...

108
00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:10.787
I was already fired from your company.

109
00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:13.356
Will I be employed by special employment?

110
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.292
Is that why you separated the Marketing Team?

111
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.294
It was your Strategic Planning Team...

112
00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:19.963
which suggested separating the Marketing Team.

113
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.798
We only...

114
00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:24.167
made the decision now.

115
00:06:31.608 --> 00:06:33.343
- Seo Hyun. - What are you doing?

116
00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.412
Oh, did I startle you?

117
00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:37.046
How couldn't I be?

118
00:06:37.614 --> 00:06:39.549
Why did you knock if you were going to open it?

119
00:06:39.582 --> 00:06:40.650
What?

120
00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:42.552
Eun Seok.

121
00:06:42.852 --> 00:06:45.955
You knock as a way of asking if you can come in.

122
00:06:46.423 --> 00:06:49.592
Even Mom and Dad don't come in unless I respond.

123
00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:53.029
I see. I'm sorry.

124
00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:55.365
It's okay. It's your first time.

125
00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:56.833
What is this about?

126
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.335
Well,

127
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.707
I just wanted to get back the necklace I gave you.

128
00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:08.211
It was you who gave it to me to begin with.

129
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:09.412
You said that it wasn't your taste...

130
00:07:09.412 --> 00:07:10.980
and that it looked better on me.

131
00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:13.283
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:16.586
It is true that it looks better on you.

133
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.522
But I've been thinking that it was a mistake.

134
00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.357
It was a meaningful gift,

135
00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.660
but it wasn't polite of me to give it away.

136
00:07:23.893 --> 00:07:25.161
Hold on.

137
00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:32.268
Here.

138
00:07:33.403 --> 00:07:35.104
Thank you. And I'm sorry.

139
00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:37.207
Okay. I need to go to school,

140
00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.408
so I should change now.

141
00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:40.477
Sure, sure.

142
00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:47.050
Unbelievable.

143
00:07:47.584 --> 00:07:49.419
Why is she pestering me?

144
00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:23.953
- Please enjoy. - Have a good day.

145
00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:26.789
- Ji Soo. - Yes?

146
00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:28.024
I can manage on my own.

147
00:08:28.024 --> 00:08:29.325
Go, and do your delivery.

148
00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:31.794
Since yesterday was the first day,

149
00:08:31.794 --> 00:08:34.364
I'll go and see how much of them were sold first.

150
00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:36.466
Okay. That's a good idea.

151
00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:39.402
You want to see the bicycle guy twice.

152
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.772
It's only until I find out when he comes to the cafe.

153
00:08:43.907 --> 00:08:45.275
I'll be back.

154
00:08:52.248 --> 00:08:54.784
She would have called back if she saw the check.

155
00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:05.328
Nice... Nice to see you.

156
00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:07.030
Hi.

157
00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:11.801
I came to see how much of the bread...

158
00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.403
was sold yesterday.

159
00:09:16.172 --> 00:09:17.440
What do you mean?

160
00:09:18.408 --> 00:09:21.911
Our bakery supplies our baked goods to this cafe.

161
00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.413
We started yesterday.

162
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:29.285
It was all sold out.

163
00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.654
Oh, I see.

164
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:34.557
Then I'll hurry back and bring the bread for you.

165
00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.159
I'll be back soon.

166
00:09:39.028 --> 00:09:41.497
We're making good use of the chairs.

167
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.771
- Hee. - It's... It's only...

168
00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:50.773
because their baked goods are delicious. Really.

169
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.142
And the customers asked for something to eat too.

170
00:09:53.142 --> 00:09:54.377
But still.

171
00:09:57.413 --> 00:09:58.414
By the way,

172
00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:01.184
how much did she pay for the chairs?

173
00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:02.986
1,000 dollars.

174
00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:04.654
Didn't I tell you?

175
00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:06.656
1,000 dollars?

176
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:10.693
Mr. Kang, I'll be back.

177
00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:21.004
I have a question for you.

178
00:10:21.804 --> 00:10:23.039
For me?

179
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.576
You bought those chairs to use them here, right?

180
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.411
Yes.

181
00:10:28.645 --> 00:10:31.047
The elders visit our bakery sometimes.

182
00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:34.150
The bakery's owner must've paid for them, right?

183
00:10:34.517 --> 00:10:35.685
Yes.

184
00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.054
Hello.

185
00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.156
Did you give her 1,000 dollars?

186
00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:42.425
- What? 1,000 dollars? - Wait.

187
00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:43.893
Well, that was...

188
00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:47.030
If you don't mind, may I ask how much you gave her?

189
00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:51.901
I gave her 100 dollars.

190
00:10:54.504 --> 00:10:55.505
I understand.

191
00:10:58.007 --> 00:10:59.008
What should I do?

192
00:11:02.045 --> 00:11:03.046
Here is 900 dollars.

193
00:11:03.046 --> 00:11:05.281
I was told that I was to decide the price.

194
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:07.116
So... That's why I decided to pay that much.

195
00:11:07.116 --> 00:11:08.651
You were just running an errand.

196
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.825
I'll take these.

197
00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:18.027
Goodbye.

198
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.898
Hey.

199
00:11:22.398 --> 00:11:23.866
Goodness.

200
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:27.804
But you did manage to see him twice though.

201
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:30.673
He's angry, isn't he?

202
00:11:32.742 --> 00:11:33.910
Hey, you...

203
00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:42.051
You're still here.

204
00:11:42.051 --> 00:11:43.886
I figured you had something to tell me.

205
00:11:44.654 --> 00:11:46.255
How did you know?

206
00:11:46.422 --> 00:11:47.423
You've been...

207
00:11:47.824 --> 00:11:49.826
wanting to talk to me before too, right?

208
00:11:50.326 --> 00:11:51.327
Sorry?

209
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.871
- Yes. I... - Don't say it.

210
00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.174
- Pardon me? - Let's keep it that way.

211
00:12:05.675 --> 00:12:07.877
I don't want you to tell me anything.

212
00:12:07.877 --> 00:12:08.911
I...

213
00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:11.047
like someone else.

214
00:12:12.915 --> 00:12:13.950
Please.

215
00:12:30.032 --> 00:12:32.802
Right. He likes someone else.

216
00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:37.774
It must be that girl back then.

217
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.486
How many days do you want?

218
00:12:51.621 --> 00:12:52.755
Sorry?

219
00:12:52.789 --> 00:12:54.423
Don't you need to cry for a few days?

220
00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.059
Women crying is what I hate the most.

221
00:12:57.293 --> 00:12:58.561
So take a few days off.

222
00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:01.531
I won't cry.

223
00:13:02.498 --> 00:13:04.300
I already knew this would happen.

224
00:13:05.668 --> 00:13:08.271
I gave him my number, but he never called back.

225
00:13:09.172 --> 00:13:11.174
And I already knew...

226
00:13:11.174 --> 00:13:12.909
that he likes someone else.

227
00:13:16.913 --> 00:13:19.816
But how did he know I was going to confess my love?

228
00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:25.054
Mom, Eun Seok isn't ready yet.

229
00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:26.823
I think it'd be better...

230
00:13:26.823 --> 00:13:28.825
if you delayed bringing her into the company.

231
00:13:28.925 --> 00:13:31.527
If she is too prepared, she might stand out.

232
00:13:31.994 --> 00:13:33.663
Other employees will remember her...

233
00:13:33.663 --> 00:13:35.565
from when she had the contract job.

234
00:13:37.266 --> 00:13:39.168
I didn't think that far.

235
00:13:42.638 --> 00:13:44.173
She's bright and intelligent.

236
00:13:44.173 --> 00:13:45.575
(Resume)

237
00:13:46.809 --> 00:13:48.778
Her grades are good.

238
00:13:48.778 --> 00:13:51.013
And her evaluation from the Marketing Team is too.

239
00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:54.784
She should've been given the permenant position.

240
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.287
I can see that she did everything she could.

241
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:00.623
But Do Kyung,

242
00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.025
you are being a little harsh on Eun Seok.

243
00:14:03.025 --> 00:14:04.327
What is going on?

244
00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:07.530
She needs to be straightened out a bit.

245
00:14:09.632 --> 00:14:10.766
(General Manager Min)

246
00:14:14.237 --> 00:14:15.238
What is it?

247
00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:18.040
Eun Seok wants to go out?

248
00:14:21.744 --> 00:14:24.914
Eun Seok wants to go out for an hour.

249
00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.183
Let her, and test her.

250
00:14:27.917 --> 00:14:31.020
I'm sorry, but I'd like to get a refund for this.

251
00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:38.694
May I ask why you want to get a refund?

252
00:14:40.029 --> 00:14:41.697
Please just refund this for me.

253
00:14:50.773 --> 00:14:52.875
Ji Tae, you said you'd never get married.

254
00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:54.310
I'll never get married!

255
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.745
I don't want to get married.

256
00:14:55.945 --> 00:14:57.747
You told me to go on a blind date.

257
00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:00.549
You told me to see someone else whenever I wanted.

258
00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:02.919
I'm the oldest son of a poor family.

259
00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:05.688
I'm hopeless, so I'll never get married.

260
00:15:07.423 --> 00:15:08.791
I just can't...

261
00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:12.328
pass down my poverty to my own children.

262
00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.263
So I won't get married.

263
00:15:14.797 --> 00:15:17.199
I can't even afford the apartment you want.

264
00:15:18.034 --> 00:15:19.168
So I won't get married.

265
00:15:19.435 --> 00:15:20.870
I won't ever!

266
00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:45.528
Tae Soo!

267
00:15:48.898 --> 00:15:50.766
- Thank you. - Thanks for coming.

268
00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:54.637
Aren't you going to have lunch?

269
00:15:54.637 --> 00:15:56.572
Of course I am. I am working so I can eat.

270
00:15:57.139 --> 00:15:58.507
I'll have spicy nakji bokkeum.

271
00:16:00.776 --> 00:16:03.012
Aren't online lessons too expensive for our budget?

272
00:16:03.412 --> 00:16:06.615
We grew up taking lessons on TV, but time's changed.

273
00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:09.685
- What's for lunch? - Wait. I'm almost done.

274
00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:11.520
(Sending)

275
00:16:11.787 --> 00:16:13.122
Do I get to choose?

276
00:16:13.422 --> 00:16:14.790
Are you craving for anything in particular?

277
00:16:16.492 --> 00:16:18.527
I want something spicy enough to burn my stomach.

278
00:16:34.176 --> 00:16:36.412
What's wrong? Did you fight with Ji Tae?

279
00:16:36.445 --> 00:16:37.513
What do you mean?

280
00:16:37.513 --> 00:16:40.416
It seems like you two are angry at each other.

281
00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:43.052
Let's go eat kkomjangeo instead of nakji bokkeum.

282
00:16:43.052 --> 00:16:44.053
Sure.

283
00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.825
Fortunately, your bones are fine.

284
00:16:49.825 --> 00:16:53.129
But don't lift anything heavy for two weeks.

285
00:16:53.396 --> 00:16:54.797
Two weeks?

286
00:16:54.997 --> 00:16:57.133
Yes. Considering your age,

287
00:16:57.133 --> 00:16:59.368
it's better to rest for a longer period.

288
00:17:02.938 --> 00:17:04.573
I can take out the garbage...

289
00:17:04.573 --> 00:17:07.309
and assist the carpenter.

290
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:08.778
I can lift lighter loads.

291
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.012
No, you can't.

292
00:17:10.012 --> 00:17:12.415
If you get hurt again, you won't be able to work.

293
00:17:12.415 --> 00:17:13.549
Mr. Kang,

294
00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:15.551
I am not doing this for money.

295
00:17:15.551 --> 00:17:17.453
You can pay me half.

296
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.523
You must be avoiding your wife after fighting.

297
00:17:20.823 --> 00:17:22.491
Why don't you just reconcile with her?

298
00:17:22.992 --> 00:17:25.528
I have to finish what I have started.

299
00:17:25.528 --> 00:17:27.563
You should just go home and rest.

300
00:17:27.563 --> 00:17:30.800
I will call you again when our next project begins.

301
00:17:37.373 --> 00:17:39.875
A hamburger steak is usually served on a plate.

302
00:17:40.009 --> 00:17:43.312
But our hamburger steak is served in a clay pot.

303
00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:46.682
But it is quite heavy.

304
00:17:46.682 --> 00:17:48.951
Why do you insist serving it in a clay pot?

305
00:17:49.618 --> 00:17:50.953
First of all,

306
00:17:50.953 --> 00:17:52.855
clay pots keep the food warm...

307
00:17:52.855 --> 00:17:54.557
until the customers finish the food.

308
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.792
And since it's a traditional earthenware,

309
00:17:56.792 --> 00:17:59.528
it adds sentimental values to the dish as well.

310
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:01.297
I see.

311
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.578
Honey.

312
00:18:17.046 --> 00:18:18.047
Hey.

313
00:18:19.315 --> 00:18:20.382
Well...

314
00:18:21.617 --> 00:18:23.219
Did you quit work?

315
00:18:25.287 --> 00:18:26.288
Give that to me.

316
00:18:29.992 --> 00:18:31.861
What's wrong? Did you get hurt?

317
00:18:32.228 --> 00:18:34.063
No, it's nothing.

318
00:18:34.763 --> 00:18:37.266
It's not nothing. You even got a cast.

319
00:18:37.766 --> 00:18:40.436
How bad is it? How did you get hurt?

320
00:18:41.337 --> 00:18:42.538
What do you have there?

321
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.108
(Gyeongseong Hambagu)

322
00:18:46.442 --> 00:18:47.776
What is it?

323
00:18:48.511 --> 00:18:49.778
You know what it is.

324
00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:52.414
I went to the training of the franchise...

325
00:18:53.849 --> 00:18:55.584
Haesung Corporation is opening for us.

326
00:19:03.325 --> 00:19:05.227
Are you out of your mind?

327
00:19:08.998 --> 00:19:11.133
You never told me not to do it.

328
00:19:11.133 --> 00:19:13.702
I left the contract wide-open on the table.

329
00:19:13.702 --> 00:19:15.104
Didn't you know what that meant?

330
00:19:15.104 --> 00:19:17.339
Did you think that would stop me?

331
00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:19.708
Yes. I thought that would stop you.

332
00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:22.278
How can you accept it? Do you have no shame?

333
00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:24.680
This is why I accepted it.

334
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.249
I didn't know when you'd become like this.

335
00:19:27.683 --> 00:19:28.684
What?

336
00:19:28.851 --> 00:19:31.754
How can we live off your daily wage?

337
00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:36.492
Living with 1,500 dollars a month was hard enough.

338
00:19:38.627 --> 00:19:40.296
I know how you feel,

339
00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:43.832
but this is not for me. It's for our children.

340
00:19:43.832 --> 00:19:45.501
Don't use our children as excuses.

341
00:19:45.834 --> 00:19:48.938
Aren't you ashamed to use that for our children?

342
00:19:51.807 --> 00:19:53.209
Go cancel the contract.

343
00:19:53.742 --> 00:19:55.678
I will earn more money.

344
00:19:56.378 --> 00:19:59.048
Why haven't you done that all along?

345
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.285
No matter what you say,

346
00:20:03.485 --> 00:20:05.054
I am going to run this restaurant.

347
00:20:06.689 --> 00:20:09.058
Ji Soo. Yes. Our dear Ji Soo.

348
00:20:09.058 --> 00:20:11.794
If it weren't for us, she would've died there.

349
00:20:12.428 --> 00:20:14.330
Don't you remember?

350
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.532
We did raise her after all.

351
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:19.735
I will just consider it as a payment for that.

352
00:20:20.102 --> 00:20:21.103
Honey.

353
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:22.905
I am going to do well...

354
00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:25.808
and send her abroad to study baking.

355
00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:28.510
Stop being ridiculous. Please, honey.

356
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.546
Please stop. You must cancel the contract.

357
00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:32.348
I will work harder.

358
00:20:32.348 --> 00:20:36.085
How can you work harder? What can you do?

359
00:20:36.085 --> 00:20:37.720
You are too old for that.

360
00:20:39.188 --> 00:20:40.990
Let's run this together,

361
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.192
marry off Ji Tae,

362
00:20:43.425 --> 00:20:44.526
and Ji Ho...

363
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.031
Do you know how hard Ji Ho studies?

364
00:20:50.766 --> 00:20:52.201
Thank you, my dear friend.

365
00:20:52.935 --> 00:20:54.103
Good job.

366
00:20:54.236 --> 00:20:55.371
Don't forget.

367
00:20:55.371 --> 00:20:57.640
If you move out, you're going to treat me.

368
00:20:58.207 --> 00:21:00.242
If I succeed to move out, I will treat you.

369
00:21:01.277 --> 00:21:04.780
If my business succeeds, I will treat you for life.

370
00:21:05.814 --> 00:21:09.518
Move out before making any promises.

371
00:21:11.587 --> 00:21:13.355
- I'm leaving now. - Bye.

372
00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:17.226
What is that?

373
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.529
- It's a foreshadow. - A foreshadow?

374
00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:23.932
Everything needs a sign.

375
00:21:23.932 --> 00:21:25.267
(Report Card)

376
00:21:25.768 --> 00:21:30.306
This is the key that will get me stand on my own.

377
00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:34.943
Seriously. Come to your senses, boy.

378
00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:37.980
What will you do if Ji Ho goes...

379
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.848
- to college next year? - Nice.

380
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.785
Do you have money...

381
00:21:43.452 --> 00:21:45.354
to pay for Ji Ho's college tuition?

382
00:21:46.355 --> 00:21:49.525
- I do. - For four years?

383
00:21:51.527 --> 00:21:54.596
Do you want Ji Ho to work and study like Ji An?

384
00:21:54.596 --> 00:21:56.699
Or will you ask for money from Ji Tae again?

385
00:22:01.003 --> 00:22:02.137
I'm home.

386
00:22:03.939 --> 00:22:05.741
How did you get here, Dad?

387
00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:08.544
Ji Tae, you're home.

388
00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:12.548
What happened to your hand?

389
00:22:13.482 --> 00:22:16.085
He got hurt.

390
00:22:17.052 --> 00:22:19.054
So he quit his job.

391
00:22:19.988 --> 00:22:22.825
You quit your job?

392
00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:28.564
No. I am going back soon.

393
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:32.034
I won't die out like this.

394
00:22:32.034 --> 00:22:34.603
Don't you worry. I got everything planned.

395
00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:37.873
- Okay. Get some rest. - Okay.

396
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:40.509
The kids don't know about this yet.

397
00:22:49.585 --> 00:22:52.020
I left some documents at the office.

398
00:22:52.254 --> 00:22:54.022
I need to finish it by tonight.

399
00:22:54.223 --> 00:22:55.958
Okay. Go then.

400
00:23:09.972 --> 00:23:12.374
(Ji Tae)

401
00:23:20.516 --> 00:23:21.517
Hello?

402
00:23:23.185 --> 00:23:25.687
I'm outside your house. Would you come out?

403
00:23:29.258 --> 00:23:31.860
Please bring out my suit if you haven't tossed it.

404
00:23:33.629 --> 00:23:34.763
Okay.

405
00:23:47.209 --> 00:23:49.711
Have a seat. Don't be old-fashioned.

406
00:24:06.128 --> 00:24:07.596
It's cold outside today.

407
00:24:10.566 --> 00:24:11.600
Thanks.

408
00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:18.540
I am sorry about the other day.

409
00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:21.477
I was thoughtless.

410
00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:24.713
I should've waited...

411
00:24:25.914 --> 00:24:27.115
until you parted with that guy.

412
00:24:28.817 --> 00:24:30.052
Why didn't you?

413
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.188
I was too hungry.

414
00:24:36.925 --> 00:24:38.494
I am sorry about going on a blind date...

415
00:24:39.761 --> 00:24:42.197
- without a notice. - Sorry I embarrassed you.

416
00:24:42.197 --> 00:24:45.300
It was fine. He wasn't my type.

417
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.269
And yet, you went to get more drinks.

418
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:49.137
- You never know. - Let's break up.

419
00:24:51.773 --> 00:24:53.308
Didn't we break up that day?

420
00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:57.279
Lee Soo A.

421
00:24:58.046 --> 00:25:00.215
We can't break up fighting after four years, can we?

422
00:25:01.116 --> 00:25:02.384
We should break up with a smile.

423
00:25:03.118 --> 00:25:04.586
We talked about this.

424
00:25:05.053 --> 00:25:07.523
We are supposed to wish each other good luck.

425
00:25:09.858 --> 00:25:10.926
Right.

426
00:25:12.294 --> 00:25:13.428
You're right.

427
00:25:22.037 --> 00:25:23.472
I hope you meet a good man.

428
00:25:25.107 --> 00:25:26.475
Don't date a man like that guy the other day.

429
00:25:27.976 --> 00:25:29.778
His smile looks like he's a playboy.

430
00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:33.749
Is he rich enough?

431
00:25:37.719 --> 00:25:39.988
I heard he has a three-bedroom apartment.

432
00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:44.726
What does he do?

433
00:25:45.494 --> 00:25:46.528
He's an accountant.

434
00:25:47.262 --> 00:25:50.032
Gosh. I feel even more sorry.

435
00:25:54.536 --> 00:25:55.604
Stay healthy.

436
00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:59.374
You won't get married anyway,

437
00:26:00.275 --> 00:26:02.644
so I won't tell you to meet a good woman.

438
00:26:03.245 --> 00:26:04.813
This is all I got to say.

439
00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:09.384
It's been a pleasure being with you.

440
00:26:13.255 --> 00:26:14.256
Me too.

441
00:26:18.427 --> 00:26:19.528
Take care.

442
00:26:23.065 --> 00:26:24.099
You too.

443
00:26:53.795 --> 00:26:57.833
(Dormitory)

444
00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:01.236
Great.

445
00:27:02.304 --> 00:27:03.538
You're home, Ji Tae.

446
00:27:09.778 --> 00:27:11.747
Why are you going to bed with your clothes on?

447
00:27:12.948 --> 00:27:14.983
Why do you have another suit?

448
00:27:47.849 --> 00:27:49.017
Dad.

449
00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:51.053
Gosh, Ji Soo.

450
00:27:51.853 --> 00:27:53.588
What is this? Are you crying?

451
00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:54.790
Is something wrong?

452
00:27:56.258 --> 00:27:57.926
I am just happy.

453
00:27:58.827 --> 00:28:01.730
I am just happy to see you.

454
00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:23.385
(Refund receipt)

455
00:28:23.585 --> 00:28:26.955
I returned the gifts for my other family.

456
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:31.460
Didn't you give it to them?

457
00:28:33.028 --> 00:28:34.329
They refused.

458
00:28:35.497 --> 00:28:38.033
I didn't tell you about it...

459
00:28:38.033 --> 00:28:39.735
because I was planning to take it back to them.

460
00:28:40.535 --> 00:28:42.104
But I was thoughtless.

461
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:45.507
I am sorry to have caused trouble...

462
00:28:46.074 --> 00:28:48.276
for both my previous and my current parents.

463
00:28:53.615 --> 00:28:55.617
Yes. I gave you that money...

464
00:28:56.051 --> 00:28:58.553
to spend it in a day, but you couldn't.

465
00:28:59.254 --> 00:29:00.355
So I will take it back.

466
00:29:04.192 --> 00:29:06.528
You won't be leaving home for a while,

467
00:29:06.528 --> 00:29:08.363
and you will be with the driver if you need to.

468
00:29:09.064 --> 00:29:10.799
Keep this for any emergencies.

469
00:29:13.034 --> 00:29:14.302
I will do as you say.

470
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:29.951
Why are you listening to music at home?

471
00:29:29.951 --> 00:29:31.620
You used to hate listening to music at home.

472
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.522
That was because I was stressed...

473
00:29:33.522 --> 00:29:35.090
about the graduation recital.

474
00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.692
This is our date, so I don't mind it.

475
00:29:39.227 --> 00:29:40.262
Eun Seok.

476
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.698
You're listening to music.

477
00:29:43.965 --> 00:29:45.033
Have a seat.

478
00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:47.803
Have a seat if you want to listen to music.

479
00:29:52.374 --> 00:29:55.177
You listen to classical music with Do Kyung.

480
00:29:55.477 --> 00:29:56.545
When he was studying abroad,

481
00:29:56.545 --> 00:29:58.180
we once went on a music trip.

482
00:29:59.548 --> 00:30:00.949
The La Scala was great, wasn't it?

483
00:30:01.516 --> 00:30:03.618
Did you like the Covent Garden better?

484
00:30:04.286 --> 00:30:05.854
I said the Metropolitan was the best.

485
00:30:05.987 --> 00:30:06.988
The Vienna State Opera is the second.

486
00:30:07.956 --> 00:30:11.092
Are those the places you visited on the trip?

487
00:30:11.459 --> 00:30:13.295
No, they are opera houses.

488
00:30:14.796 --> 00:30:16.598
You must study a lot to catch up.

489
00:30:17.465 --> 00:30:19.234
I just started studying.

490
00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:21.369
I need to study more.

491
00:30:21.937 --> 00:30:25.240
Seo Hyun, I know that you like Mahler,

492
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.575
but Symphony Number 3 is far too long.

493
00:30:27.209 --> 00:30:29.544
Do you want to listen to Number 5, Adagietto?

494
00:30:29.544 --> 00:30:31.213
I'm not a fan of Alma Mahler.

495
00:30:31.213 --> 00:30:32.914
Let's go with Number 2, Resurrection.

496
00:30:37.452 --> 00:30:38.720
What do you think about this song?

497
00:30:39.287 --> 00:30:41.556
I don't know well,

498
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.092
but it's lovely to listen to.

499
00:30:44.726 --> 00:30:46.895
Is that so? Then keep listening.

500
00:30:48.697 --> 00:30:50.765
Let's listen to Resurrection after this.

501
00:30:55.337 --> 00:30:56.905
I forgot I had homework.

502
00:30:56.905 --> 00:30:58.773
Eun Suk, I will go back to my room first.

503
00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.315
They're so scary.

504
00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:11.186
When will they stop being mad at me?

505
00:31:21.363 --> 00:31:23.298
Eat slowly.

506
00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:25.734
Why are you so crazy about food made with flour?

507
00:31:25.934 --> 00:31:27.369
I got it from you.

508
00:31:27.535 --> 00:31:29.137
Mom always nags you for it,

509
00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:30.438
but you still love eating sujebi.

510
00:31:33.074 --> 00:31:34.075
Ji Soo.

511
00:31:34.442 --> 00:31:36.278
What do you want to do in the future?

512
00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:39.781
Do you want to open a bakery?

513
00:31:40.548 --> 00:31:42.584
I don't want a bakery. I don't have money either.

514
00:31:44.019 --> 00:31:46.688
If you had money, would you like to open one?

515
00:31:46.855 --> 00:31:48.556
I have never thought about that.

516
00:31:48.823 --> 00:31:51.293
I just want to make bread.

517
00:31:53.094 --> 00:31:54.095
Then...

518
00:31:54.696 --> 00:31:57.365
why don't you make bread professionally?

519
00:31:57.499 --> 00:31:59.701
You can study baking abroad.

520
00:31:59.701 --> 00:32:01.236
Abroad?

521
00:32:01.236 --> 00:32:03.238
No, I don't want to go abroad.

522
00:32:03.538 --> 00:32:05.273
Why do you ask that?

523
00:32:05.507 --> 00:32:07.108
I don't need to study baking abroad.

524
00:32:07.108 --> 00:32:08.476
I just want to...

525
00:32:08.476 --> 00:32:10.545
become Mr. Kang's apprentice.

526
00:32:10.545 --> 00:32:11.579
I just need to learn his skills...

527
00:32:11.579 --> 00:32:13.048
and make the bread exactly like he does.

528
00:32:13.048 --> 00:32:15.116
It's exactly what I was looking for.

529
00:32:17.118 --> 00:32:19.721
It's because I am poor, isn't it?

530
00:32:20.221 --> 00:32:22.991
If your parents were rich, you'd change your mind.

531
00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:25.260
Dad, if I would do that,

532
00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.895
why would I have tried stopping Ji An?

533
00:32:26.962 --> 00:32:30.198
- You tried to stop Ji An? - I tried so hard.

534
00:32:30.665 --> 00:32:32.434
That's why I don't talk to her anymore.

535
00:32:32.834 --> 00:32:34.836
I would never leave you. Never.

536
00:32:36.338 --> 00:32:37.505
Why wouldn't you?

537
00:32:38.106 --> 00:32:40.742
I love everything I eat.

538
00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:42.577
And I especially love eating bread.

539
00:32:42.677 --> 00:32:44.312
I don't need money.

540
00:32:46.114 --> 00:32:48.850
Still, they are your real parents.

541
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.518
What? Dad.

542
00:32:50.518 --> 00:32:53.355
It's such an old-fashioned way of thinking.

543
00:32:53.488 --> 00:32:56.458
Adoption. Share-houses.

544
00:32:56.458 --> 00:32:57.726
These days,

545
00:32:57.726 --> 00:32:59.894
even strangers may become a family.

546
00:33:00.095 --> 00:33:01.463
I read this somewhere.

547
00:33:01.463 --> 00:33:03.798
They say that family means...

548
00:33:03.798 --> 00:33:06.034
"people you share food with."

549
00:33:06.034 --> 00:33:08.470
Anyone you share your food with is your family.

550
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.105
So why would you go to your biological parents...

551
00:33:10.105 --> 00:33:12.607
just because you share blood?

552
00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:16.444
Is that right?

553
00:33:19.314 --> 00:33:21.282
Why do you keep looking at me?

554
00:33:21.883 --> 00:33:25.887
I feel full just by watching you eat.

555
00:33:26.955 --> 00:33:29.190
Do you want to eat more? Here, have this.

556
00:33:29.924 --> 00:33:31.459
These noodles are so good,

557
00:33:31.459 --> 00:33:34.095
but the portion is a bit too small, right?

558
00:33:48.777 --> 00:33:50.979
Oh, Do Kyung.

559
00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:53.948
Practice the speech with Eun Seok.

560
00:33:55.483 --> 00:33:57.252
Your aunt and uncle will be there too.

561
00:33:57.285 --> 00:33:59.354
She shouldn't make any mistakes being nervous.

562
00:34:00.188 --> 00:34:01.222
Okay.

563
00:34:02.924 --> 00:34:04.526
Have a good day.

564
00:34:07.529 --> 00:34:08.763
Meet me at 6pm.

565
00:34:08.763 --> 00:34:10.298
Mr. Myung will know where to go.

566
00:34:10.432 --> 00:34:12.567
That's unnecessary.

567
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.136
But it's necessary for our family.

568
00:34:15.804 --> 00:34:17.806
It's my duty as the son of Haesung Corporation...

569
00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:19.507
to teach you if I am told to do so.

570
00:34:26.114 --> 00:34:27.549
(Personnel Transfer Report)

571
00:34:28.450 --> 00:34:29.484
Mr. Sung.

572
00:34:29.884 --> 00:34:30.985
Yes, Vice Chairman Choi.

573
00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:32.754
Isn't this odd?

574
00:34:32.754 --> 00:34:34.489
Pardon me? What do you mean?

575
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.558
Are these the only temporary employees...

576
00:34:36.558 --> 00:34:38.393
who became regular employees?

577
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.295
Nobody from the Marketing or Sales Department...

578
00:34:40.295 --> 00:34:42.430
became a regular employee. Why is that?

579
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:43.798
About that...

580
00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.733
It was our decision...

581
00:34:45.733 --> 00:34:47.368
to hire someone more equipped for the job.

582
00:34:47.368 --> 00:34:49.204
Did you fill the positions with special admissions?

583
00:34:50.238 --> 00:34:52.407
- Yes. - When advertising...

584
00:34:52.407 --> 00:34:53.641
for temporary employees,

585
00:34:53.641 --> 00:34:55.944
we promised some of them will be hired permanently.

586
00:34:56.277 --> 00:34:57.445
And you ignored that?

587
00:34:57.445 --> 00:35:00.115
Specially admitted people filled in the positions.

588
00:35:00.582 --> 00:35:01.950
And this happened.

589
00:35:03.284 --> 00:35:04.652
This is pathetic.

590
00:35:05.653 --> 00:35:06.754
To save the faces of the executives,

591
00:35:06.754 --> 00:35:09.257
you would jeopardize the company's image?

592
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:12.060
Temporary employees are a sensitive issue now.

593
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.795
Instead of being a role model,

594
00:35:13.795 --> 00:35:15.196
you broke our promise.

595
00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:17.165
What would that do to our company image?

596
00:35:18.133 --> 00:35:19.334
I apologize, sir.

597
00:35:19.334 --> 00:35:21.703
Give permanent positions to the number of people...

598
00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:23.004
you promised on the advertisement.

599
00:35:23.104 --> 00:35:24.239
I will do that, sir.

600
00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:26.574
Choose among the temporary employees...

601
00:35:26.574 --> 00:35:28.309
in order of their competency.

602
00:35:28.409 --> 00:35:29.844
There must be temporary employees who would've...

603
00:35:29.844 --> 00:35:32.547
been chosen if it weren't for the privileged ones.

604
00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:35.450
Yes. I will fix it and report it to you.

605
00:35:35.617 --> 00:35:36.684
You may leave.

606
00:35:48.863 --> 00:35:49.931
Ji Soo.

607
00:35:50.198 --> 00:35:51.199
Yes?

608
00:35:51.199 --> 00:35:53.301
What are you doing? It's past 10 already.

609
00:35:53.868 --> 00:35:54.969
You should go now.

610
00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:57.305
Okay.

611
00:36:04.946 --> 00:36:07.582
I know the bike man project ended so soon,

612
00:36:07.615 --> 00:36:09.784
but you are in charge of the bread delivery.

613
00:36:09.984 --> 00:36:11.052
I know that.

614
00:36:16.324 --> 00:36:17.992
If they have any unsold, bring it back to me.

615
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.695
- Why? - That's for my pride.

616
00:36:21.062 --> 00:36:22.964
I can't let them sell day-old bread.

617
00:36:24.299 --> 00:36:25.633
Okay.

618
00:36:31.806 --> 00:36:32.874
Go.

619
00:36:47.055 --> 00:36:48.156
Hello.

620
00:36:48.656 --> 00:36:50.058
This is the bread for today.

621
00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:52.794
If you have any bread left from yesterday, give me.

622
00:36:53.394 --> 00:36:55.930
It sold out yesterday.

623
00:36:56.097 --> 00:36:57.832
Oh, is that so?

624
00:36:58.099 --> 00:37:00.034
Okay then. Goodbye.

625
00:37:22.156 --> 00:37:23.825
Gosh, what do I do?

626
00:37:25.827 --> 00:37:28.096
That was so embarrassing. I was like a fool.

627
00:37:28.329 --> 00:37:29.464
Seriously.

628
00:37:32.233 --> 00:37:34.369
Please don't say anything to me.

629
00:37:36.738 --> 00:37:38.473
Don't say anything to you?

630
00:37:39.307 --> 00:37:42.010
He feels like a different man.

631
00:37:46.781 --> 00:37:49.117
No... No, Doctor. I can't do that.

632
00:37:49.217 --> 00:37:51.653
You promised me I'll be working at the front desk.

633
00:37:51.653 --> 00:37:53.154
I know.

634
00:37:53.154 --> 00:37:55.657
But Ms. Lee can't come as her appendix burst.

635
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.759
I need someone to take her place.

636
00:37:58.159 --> 00:37:59.927
It's your major though.

637
00:38:00.161 --> 00:38:01.696
Please do this for just one day.

638
00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:05.033
You know I have a lot of patients today.

639
00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:06.934
Doctor.

640
00:38:06.934 --> 00:38:09.203
It's just today. Only one day.

641
00:38:09.604 --> 00:38:11.806
I'll have someone else tomorrow. Okay?

642
00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.809
Okay. Good.

643
00:38:16.811 --> 00:38:18.112
- Sir. - Yes?

644
00:38:18.112 --> 00:38:19.280
Please keep your jaw relaxed.

645
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.281
- Okay. - Okay.

646
00:38:21.282 --> 00:38:22.784
That's it.

647
00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:29.424
Ji Soo.

648
00:38:36.097 --> 00:38:37.198
Hold it for just a moment.

649
00:38:40.635 --> 00:38:41.969
- Relax your jaw. - Okay.

650
00:38:42.136 --> 00:38:44.005
- Please be patient. - Okay.

651
00:38:44.205 --> 00:38:45.239
It's almost done.

652
00:38:50.044 --> 00:38:51.679
Okay. It's done.

653
00:38:51.946 --> 00:38:53.314
Thank you for your patience.

654
00:38:53.314 --> 00:38:55.717
Ji Soo, Please wrap it up.

655
00:39:15.303 --> 00:39:17.372
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry, sir.

656
00:39:17.372 --> 00:39:19.640
Gosh, what do you think you are doing?

657
00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.343
- I'm sorry, sir. - I can't believe this.

658
00:39:24.412 --> 00:39:26.314
Gosh, what is this? Get away from me.

659
00:39:26.714 --> 00:39:29.350
Hey. Darn it!

660
00:39:30.618 --> 00:39:33.154
Did you just retch while looking at my teeth?

661
00:39:33.154 --> 00:39:34.555
Well... About that...

662
00:39:34.555 --> 00:39:37.759
I... I really didn't mean to do that.

663
00:39:37.825 --> 00:39:39.093
You didn't mean to?

664
00:39:39.827 --> 00:39:42.096
Gosh, so are you saying...

665
00:39:42.597 --> 00:39:44.565
my teeth are so filthy that it made you retch?

666
00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:47.201
Well... That's just...

667
00:39:47.201 --> 00:39:49.303
Gosh, this is just unbelievable.

668
00:39:49.303 --> 00:39:51.005
What kind of wench are you?

669
00:39:53.007 --> 00:39:54.742
What are you?

670
00:39:54.842 --> 00:39:57.845
I know you're upset, but you can't use violence.

671
00:39:58.946 --> 00:40:01.616
Who do you think you are? Why would you butt in?

672
00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:05.353
Do you even know what she just did to me?

673
00:40:05.553 --> 00:40:06.788
Let go, you punk.

674
00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:10.825
By the way...

675
00:40:11.392 --> 00:40:14.796
You wouldn't want to give her settlement money.

676
00:40:15.196 --> 00:40:16.564
And for beating a woman?

677
00:40:17.432 --> 00:40:19.634
Okay. I understand. Please let go of me.

678
00:40:31.913 --> 00:40:33.347
Gosh, this shouldn't get wet.

679
00:40:34.215 --> 00:40:35.550
I must give this to him.

680
00:40:35.716 --> 00:40:36.884
What should I do?

681
00:41:17.625 --> 00:41:18.593
Take this.

682
00:41:32.507 --> 00:41:34.008
Well, this is for you...

683
00:41:38.346 --> 00:41:40.848
I only chose the good ones.

684
00:41:44.952 --> 00:41:47.154
He was so nice...

685
00:41:47.788 --> 00:41:51.058
and kind to me back then. But why be like this now?

686
00:42:01.035 --> 00:42:02.403
Why do I hate her so much?

687
00:42:02.904 --> 00:42:04.472
That is why I don't like her.

688
00:42:04.639 --> 00:42:07.308
She doesn't even say hi because she's embarrassed.

689
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.178
She was just like that back then.

690
00:42:15.082 --> 00:42:18.252
A dental hygienist who retches at her patient?

691
00:42:20.154 --> 00:42:22.890
After that fuss, she went out to buy some bread.

692
00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:24.058
And she came back eating it.

693
00:42:26.327 --> 00:42:28.429
She's like a ghost that starved to death.

694
00:42:29.697 --> 00:42:30.865
Gosh, she was ridiculous.

695
00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:33.868
How would I like such a woman?

696
00:42:34.468 --> 00:42:36.237
I'd even hate her if she were a man.

697
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.139
She's irresponsible and indifferent.

698
00:42:38.306 --> 00:42:39.640
She's just so gluttonous.

699
00:42:41.642 --> 00:42:44.579
Not all people can be smart and skillful.

700
00:42:44.579 --> 00:42:47.315
It's not that she isn't smart. She's pathetic.

701
00:42:47.548 --> 00:42:49.584
She worked at a dental clinic and a restaurant.

702
00:42:49.584 --> 00:42:50.618
And now, she works at a bakery.

703
00:42:51.118 --> 00:42:53.154
She doesn't even have a goal in her life.

704
00:42:53.354 --> 00:42:54.655
She has no plans.

705
00:42:54.755 --> 00:42:57.325
You didn't tell her what you just said,

706
00:42:57.325 --> 00:42:58.826
did you?

707
00:42:59.193 --> 00:43:01.028
I just told her I like someone else.

708
00:43:01.929 --> 00:43:03.297
And I asked her not to say anything to me.

709
00:43:04.098 --> 00:43:05.466
You're mean.

710
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:09.303
I would've been mean if I gave her false hope.

711
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:11.205
Is it mean to help her move on?

712
00:43:13.307 --> 00:43:15.076
Mom and Aunt don't get on well each other.

713
00:43:16.277 --> 00:43:17.511
And Chairman No Yang Ho doesn't want to...

714
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:19.413
hand over the company to his daughters.

715
00:43:20.414 --> 00:43:22.350
He found a good guy for his son-in-law instead.

716
00:43:23.117 --> 00:43:24.485
It's Dad and President Jung Myung Soo.

717
00:43:25.653 --> 00:43:28.055
That's why Mom and Aunt don't get along.

718
00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:30.825
Dad is the vice president though.

719
00:43:31.392 --> 00:43:32.994
Why would they not get along?

720
00:43:33.094 --> 00:43:35.529
It's not guaranteed that he'll be the president.

721
00:43:35.963 --> 00:43:37.465
It could be Dad, Uncle, or someone else.

722
00:43:37.832 --> 00:43:40.368
Chairman No left the position open.

723
00:43:41.369 --> 00:43:43.904
But Mom is his eldest daughter.

724
00:43:43.904 --> 00:43:45.973
- Then why... - Straighten your back.

725
00:43:48.009 --> 00:43:49.176
Your face has a set expression.

726
00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:54.115
Didn't Ms. Yang teach you abdominal respiration?

727
00:43:54.548 --> 00:43:55.783
What have you learned from her so far?

728
00:43:57.385 --> 00:44:00.154
Make sure to speak with a smile no matter what.

729
00:44:00.488 --> 00:44:01.756
Keep your back straight.

730
00:44:03.057 --> 00:44:05.426
As I talked about Mom and Aunt,

731
00:44:05.426 --> 00:44:07.328
you became a little girl who likes to gossip.

732
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.331
I'm sorry.

733
00:44:15.002 --> 00:44:16.137
Let's eat.

734
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:30.718
- You're hopeless. - Pardon?

735
00:44:42.363 --> 00:44:45.132
Cut meat in small pieces. Take small sips of wine.

736
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.502
Can't you even eat food properly?

737
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:51.205
Okay. I'll remember that.

738
00:44:52.006 --> 00:44:54.575
This dinner table is not just about eating food.

739
00:44:54.675 --> 00:44:56.410
The point is what happens during the dinner.

740
00:44:57.078 --> 00:44:59.613
The food is just a prop for a smooth conversation.

741
00:44:59.613 --> 00:45:01.115
Especially in business.

742
00:45:01.716 --> 00:45:03.951
Don't lose your mind by focusing on eating.

743
00:45:04.285 --> 00:45:06.754
In front of Chairman No, President No and Jung.

744
00:45:07.755 --> 00:45:08.923
Okay.

745
00:45:13.294 --> 00:45:14.895
Grandpa was a son of a butcher.

746
00:45:16.764 --> 00:45:19.633
But now, he's here today. He's not an ordinary man.

747
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:22.369
He has a humble taste,

748
00:45:22.369 --> 00:45:24.138
but that doesn't mean he's easygoing or something.

749
00:45:24.805 --> 00:45:26.307
He's a redoubtable man.

750
00:45:28.442 --> 00:45:29.744
His word is the law,

751
00:45:30.077 --> 00:45:31.445
the path, and the truth.

752
00:45:32.012 --> 00:45:33.013
Okay.

753
00:45:47.328 --> 00:45:48.329
Leave it.

754
00:45:49.096 --> 00:45:50.097
Yes, sir.

755
00:45:53.834 --> 00:45:54.869
Leave your glass.

756
00:45:57.538 --> 00:45:59.140
When someone pours you wine,

757
00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.175
leave the glass on the table.

758
00:46:01.642 --> 00:46:03.511
That means you trust the sommelier...

759
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:05.546
or whoever is serving you.

760
00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:11.886
I didn't learn that yet.

761
00:46:11.886 --> 00:46:13.654
You could've noticed that night...

762
00:46:13.654 --> 00:46:15.055
when we had dinner together.

763
00:46:15.556 --> 00:46:16.891
You're dull-witted.

764
00:46:26.734 --> 00:46:28.402
I'm done eating.

765
00:46:33.307 --> 00:46:35.409
- Let's go then. - There's still dessert.

766
00:46:38.846 --> 00:46:41.415
You still think we're here to eat.

767
00:46:41.882 --> 00:46:44.285
There's no point in eating dessert with someone...

768
00:46:44.285 --> 00:46:46.053
who forgets everything she hears.

769
00:46:47.254 --> 00:46:48.255
Let's go.

770
00:47:03.003 --> 00:47:04.104
You could've...

771
00:47:05.139 --> 00:47:07.141
called for a designated driver.

772
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:08.809
Why didn't you have any wine?

773
00:47:14.114 --> 00:47:15.449
I asked a question.

774
00:47:15.449 --> 00:47:17.218
Isn't it rude to ignore it...

775
00:47:17.384 --> 00:47:18.719
and not answer?

776
00:47:18.719 --> 00:47:21.255
I told the waiter at the restaurant...

777
00:47:21.488 --> 00:47:24.124
that I won't drink because I must drive.

778
00:47:24.491 --> 00:47:26.293
I made my intentions clear,

779
00:47:26.293 --> 00:47:28.596
so not asking why I didn't call a driver...

780
00:47:28.863 --> 00:47:30.965
is something only close friends can do.

781
00:47:34.335 --> 00:47:35.603
I understand.

782
00:47:42.176 --> 00:47:43.444
Don't look around.

783
00:47:44.011 --> 00:47:45.579
It's very unrefined to...

784
00:47:45.579 --> 00:47:47.681
look around someone else's car,

785
00:47:47.781 --> 00:47:49.683
and I dislike it very much.

786
00:47:49.783 --> 00:47:51.619
You're spying my personal space.

787
00:47:52.786 --> 00:47:54.355
I wasn't spying.

788
00:47:54.755 --> 00:47:56.056
I was looking for water because I was thirsty.

789
00:47:56.056 --> 00:47:57.925
If there is any here, is it yours?

790
00:47:58.325 --> 00:47:59.693
It's someone else's space.

791
00:47:59.927 --> 00:48:01.695
Can you drink anything you find?

792
00:48:01.695 --> 00:48:03.931
"I am thirsty. Do you have water?"

793
00:48:04.598 --> 00:48:05.866
Is that so hard?

794
00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:09.737
Are we strangers?

795
00:48:09.737 --> 00:48:12.406
Anyone other than yourself is a stranger.

796
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.276
And I don't have any water.

797
00:48:17.845 --> 00:48:19.914
If you're impolite, at least be quick-witted.

798
00:49:09.863 --> 00:49:10.864
Is she sick?

799
00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:13.834
Did she take some medicine?

800
00:49:14.535 --> 00:49:15.803
I'm sure she did.

801
00:49:15.803 --> 00:49:17.471
She'll call Ms. Min if she needs help.

802
00:49:18.806 --> 00:49:20.174
Why am I worried?

803
00:49:20.174 --> 00:49:21.241
She'd survive even if...

804
00:49:21.241 --> 00:49:22.676
she was to be left in a desert.

805
00:49:42.463 --> 00:49:43.564
Ji Soo.

806
00:49:44.965 --> 00:49:46.800
I'm sick.

807
00:49:48.802 --> 00:49:49.870
Medicine?

808
00:49:51.505 --> 00:49:53.140
I don't know where it is.

809
00:49:54.408 --> 00:49:56.176
I'm scared to ask.

810
00:49:58.345 --> 00:49:59.513
If I said...

811
00:50:01.615 --> 00:50:03.384
I did too much wrong to a man...

812
00:50:03.384 --> 00:50:05.252
who turned out to be my brother...

813
00:50:06.787 --> 00:50:09.656
and couldn't keep down what we ate for dinner,

814
00:50:11.158 --> 00:50:13.293
they might treat me even worse.

815
00:50:15.195 --> 00:50:16.430
My sister?

816
00:50:19.733 --> 00:50:21.368
She won't let me in.

817
00:50:23.037 --> 00:50:24.972
If you were here,

818
00:50:25.406 --> 00:50:27.674
you'd have caused a fuss...

819
00:50:27.975 --> 00:50:30.744
and pricked my finger to let out blood.

820
00:50:37.985 --> 00:50:39.253
I miss you.

821
00:50:42.056 --> 00:50:43.323
I feel...

822
00:50:44.758 --> 00:50:46.393
so lonely here.

823
00:51:07.948 --> 00:51:11.285
Sorry I'm late. I was on the phone with France.

824
00:51:11.285 --> 00:51:12.653
Well done.

825
00:51:14.888 --> 00:51:16.824
Why are you eating this?

826
00:51:18.826 --> 00:51:20.194
What's wrong with this?

827
00:51:20.561 --> 00:51:22.463
I like western food.

828
00:51:25.299 --> 00:51:26.867
Do you have a lot to do today?

829
00:51:29.736 --> 00:51:31.371
Ms. Yang will teach me...

830
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:33.173
manners and arts this morning.

831
00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.509
Then I learn about makeup in Cheongdam-dong,

832
00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:37.244
and I have Pilates training afterwards.

833
00:51:37.244 --> 00:51:38.912
After that, I have English lessons.

834
00:51:39.046 --> 00:51:40.047
What about lunch?

835
00:51:41.782 --> 00:51:43.951
You should give her time to eat.

836
00:51:44.885 --> 00:51:46.887
I told her to pack some sandwiches.

837
00:51:47.054 --> 00:51:49.223
She'll have little time to eat at the company.

838
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.992
She must learn as much as she can before that.

839
00:51:52.092 --> 00:51:53.760
Hang in there for just a few more days.

840
00:51:54.061 --> 00:51:56.029
Things will get better once you're at work.

841
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:57.831
Yes, I understand.

842
00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:10.177
(Vietnam economy)

843
00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:26.093
- Ji An. - Hey.

844
00:52:43.343 --> 00:52:45.012
Who is this?

845
00:52:45.779 --> 00:52:46.914
Ji Soo.

846
00:52:47.181 --> 00:52:49.183
What... What happened to your voice?

847
00:52:50.551 --> 00:52:52.219
Ji An.

848
00:52:58.258 --> 00:53:00.827
Something urgent came up. Go back home first.

849
00:53:01.261 --> 00:53:02.829
- Taxi. - Miss.

850
00:53:07.801 --> 00:53:08.802
Ji Soo.

851
00:53:13.073 --> 00:53:14.508
Who are you?

852
00:53:15.075 --> 00:53:17.077
Why do you look like Ji An?

853
00:53:17.844 --> 00:53:19.846
You can't even drink half a can of beer.

854
00:53:21.848 --> 00:53:23.951
Ji Soo, what's wrong?

855
00:53:25.385 --> 00:53:27.221
Is it really you?

856
00:53:27.387 --> 00:53:30.824
- Gosh. It really is you. - Yes, it's me.

857
00:53:31.558 --> 00:53:32.826
Don't be silly.

858
00:53:34.795 --> 00:53:36.196
Look out, Ji Soo.

859
00:53:36.763 --> 00:53:38.532
Ji Soo, are you all right?

860
00:53:38.732 --> 00:53:40.801
Let go. Let go of me.

861
00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:43.136
Why are you holding me back?

862
00:53:43.237 --> 00:53:45.739
Leave. I cut you out of my life.

863
00:53:45.739 --> 00:53:47.174
I cut you out.

864
00:53:47.174 --> 00:53:48.575
Ji Soo.

865
00:53:50.244 --> 00:53:52.012
What happened to you?

866
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:55.215
He told me...

867
00:53:56.283 --> 00:53:57.951
not to do it.

868
00:53:58.785 --> 00:54:00.954
He says I should not say anything.

869
00:54:01.888 --> 00:54:03.824
He told me not to say anything.

870
00:54:04.558 --> 00:54:06.426
Did you confess to Mr. Sun?

871
00:54:06.426 --> 00:54:07.928
No.

872
00:54:08.695 --> 00:54:11.698
I haven't said anything to him yet,

873
00:54:11.865 --> 00:54:14.468
but he told me not to.

874
00:54:15.202 --> 00:54:16.970
- Come here. - Why?

875
00:54:18.505 --> 00:54:21.375
Sit down here and tell me what happened.

876
00:54:21.742 --> 00:54:23.443
What do you mean by you saying nothing,

877
00:54:23.443 --> 00:54:25.612
and him telling you not to say anything?

878
00:54:25.712 --> 00:54:27.848
He likes someone else.

879
00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:30.183
He likes someone else?

880
00:54:30.617 --> 00:54:32.753
Yes, he said so.

881
00:54:33.887 --> 00:54:35.255
No, he does.

882
00:54:35.989 --> 00:54:37.924
I actually saw her.

883
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.462
And you still like him?

884
00:54:43.096 --> 00:54:46.366
Didn't you even check on things like that?

885
00:54:46.366 --> 00:54:47.801
You said you spied on him.

886
00:54:47.801 --> 00:54:49.603
Didn't you know he had a girlfriend?

887
00:54:49.603 --> 00:54:51.905
No, that's not it.

888
00:54:51.905 --> 00:54:54.908
I don't know yet if she's his girlfriend.

889
00:54:54.908 --> 00:54:57.411
Do you think I'm an idiot?

890
00:54:57.411 --> 00:55:00.113
Would I like a guy who has a girlfriend?

891
00:55:00.113 --> 00:55:01.448
Even if they aren't dating,

892
00:55:01.448 --> 00:55:03.483
you said you saw the girl he likes.

893
00:55:04.117 --> 00:55:05.952
You should've given up then...

894
00:55:05.952 --> 00:55:08.055
or told him you liked him sooner.

895
00:55:08.055 --> 00:55:10.023
I wrote down what you should say.

896
00:55:10.023 --> 00:55:11.558
Why didn't you read that...

897
00:55:11.558 --> 00:55:13.660
only to end up in this mess? This is upsetting.

898
00:55:14.261 --> 00:55:15.862
Are you upset?

899
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:20.634
Right now... I feel like...

900
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:23.804
someone's stabbing me here with a needle.

901
00:55:28.508 --> 00:55:29.576
Does it hurt a lot?

902
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:31.545
Yes.

903
00:55:31.678 --> 00:55:33.113
You know,

904
00:55:33.213 --> 00:55:35.882
it feels like a really small needle,

905
00:55:36.183 --> 00:55:37.718
something 10 times smaller...

906
00:55:37.718 --> 00:55:39.986
than what you use to sew things up,

907
00:55:40.053 --> 00:55:43.924
is stabbing my heart, and it hurts a lot.

908
00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:47.194
It must really hurt.

909
00:55:49.363 --> 00:55:50.864
What should I do now?

910
00:55:51.932 --> 00:55:52.933
Get over him.

911
00:55:53.834 --> 00:55:55.369
If the guy's that adamant,

912
00:55:56.002 --> 00:55:57.137
it won't work.

913
00:55:58.605 --> 00:56:00.640
If I tell myself to forget,

914
00:56:01.308 --> 00:56:02.943
will I be able to?

915
00:56:03.176 --> 00:56:05.445
Stop drinking.

916
00:56:08.048 --> 00:56:11.351
I see why you always drank beer.

917
00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:13.987
Drinking this...

918
00:56:14.054 --> 00:56:16.223
makes the pain go away.

919
00:56:16.923 --> 00:56:19.059
I feel so dizzy.

920
00:56:20.327 --> 00:56:21.928
No, Ji Soo.

921
00:56:22.562 --> 00:56:23.563
Ji Soo.

922
00:56:36.576 --> 00:56:39.613
Get rid of everything Eun Seok brought with her.

923
00:56:44.117 --> 00:56:45.485
My goodness, Ji An.

924
00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:48.155
What happened to her?

925
00:56:48.889 --> 00:56:50.557
What happened?

926
00:56:50.891 --> 00:56:52.058
Oh, dear.

927
00:56:56.797 --> 00:56:58.465
Thank you. You should go.

928
00:56:58.465 --> 00:57:00.233
Mom, let me catch my breath.

929
00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:03.370
Go home. Why do you keep coming here?

930
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:08.008
Well, I called Ji Soo, but she was drunk.

931
00:57:08.141 --> 00:57:11.845
You should've called me. Why did you come over?

932
00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:13.413
Don't do that ever again.

933
00:57:15.449 --> 00:57:17.217
Don't scold her.

934
00:57:17.951 --> 00:57:19.653
Dad's in Seoul.

935
00:57:19.653 --> 00:57:21.888
Get going before he sees you.

936
00:57:22.055 --> 00:57:26.793
- I'll call you soon. - But is Dad okay?

937
00:57:26.793 --> 00:57:28.028
Yes, now go.

938
00:57:31.097 --> 00:57:33.867
Taxi service? This is Daebang-dong...

939
00:57:48.949 --> 00:57:50.617
Dad, I'm sorry.

940
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:13.006
Why does she always cause trouble?

941
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.809
Why? Did something happen again?

942
00:58:15.809 --> 00:58:17.310
Was she sick by any chance?

943
00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:18.578
Not at all.

944
00:58:18.578 --> 00:58:20.947
She skipped all her lessons and disappeared.

945
00:58:21.348 --> 00:58:22.782
Again?

946
00:58:23.116 --> 00:58:24.851
She also took back her necklace.

947
00:58:25.752 --> 00:58:27.721
Does she even want to become our family?

948
00:58:27.954 --> 00:58:29.256
What necklace?

949
00:58:29.523 --> 00:58:30.991
The one you gave her.

950
00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:34.261
She wanted it back saying she'd been rude to you.

951
00:58:34.661 --> 00:58:37.264
I guess she looked up how much it cost.

952
00:58:39.733 --> 00:58:42.235
Sorry. I didn't think it through.

953
00:58:42.802 --> 00:58:46.006
Everything you said yesterday is right.

954
00:58:55.982 --> 00:58:56.983
What's all that?

955
00:58:57.083 --> 00:58:59.052
Ms. No told me to get rid of it all.

956
00:59:07.761 --> 00:59:10.463
She finally got herself into this mess.

957
00:59:15.702 --> 00:59:17.037
I'm home.

958
00:59:24.744 --> 00:59:26.012
I'm sorry.

959
00:59:27.581 --> 00:59:28.615
Sit.

960
00:59:34.888 --> 00:59:36.823
I didn't ask for permission...

961
00:59:36.823 --> 00:59:38.825
It must have been related to your old family.

962
00:59:40.994 --> 00:59:44.331
Yes. My sister was having a hard time.

963
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:46.132
You joined our family now.

964
00:59:46.132 --> 00:59:48.034
You're a member of the Haesung family.

965
00:59:48.335 --> 00:59:51.137
I set a schedule so you wouldn't be so foolish.

966
00:59:51.137 --> 00:59:52.505
Yet, you let me down like this?

967
00:59:53.573 --> 00:59:55.175
I thought you were smart.

968
00:59:55.575 --> 00:59:57.077
I was wrong.

969
00:59:58.178 --> 00:59:59.279
We were twins...

970
00:59:59.946 --> 01:00:02.482
for the past 25 years.

971
01:00:03.717 --> 01:00:04.985
She needed me.

972
01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:10.523
I said we must make up for the lost 25 years...

973
01:00:11.224 --> 01:00:13.426
and that you shouldn't go off alone.

974
01:00:14.394 --> 01:00:16.029
Do you not know what that means?

975
01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:20.600
I can't cut them out of my life...

976
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.402
just like that, Mother.

977
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.772
There's nothing you can't do with determination.

978
01:00:26.272 --> 01:00:29.809
Do you think you can be higher or special...

979
01:00:29.909 --> 01:00:33.713
by acting like others and doing all you wish?

980
01:00:34.848 --> 01:00:37.717
She is my sister.

981
01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:39.252
She used to be.

982
01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:40.654
Mother.

983
01:00:41.655 --> 01:00:44.658
Fine. This girl who was your sister.

984
01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:46.526
Let's hear about...

985
01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.561
why you needed to be there for her.

986
01:00:51.598 --> 01:00:54.734
Was the girl who was your sister at death's door?

987
01:00:56.503 --> 01:00:57.704
Why...

988
01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:00.907
Why am I not allowed to see my family?

989
01:01:02.008 --> 01:01:04.044
Just because I'm with you now...

990
01:01:04.344 --> 01:01:06.546
doesn't mean they're no longer my family.

991
01:01:07.113 --> 01:01:09.182
My siblings cannot become strangers.

992
01:01:11.217 --> 01:01:12.252
Is that so?

993
01:01:13.953 --> 01:01:15.755
Here, I'm Eun Seok,

994
01:01:17.824 --> 01:01:18.892
but...

995
01:01:19.192 --> 01:01:22.595
I'm still Seo Ji An no matter how hard I try.

996
01:01:22.595 --> 01:01:23.596
Then...

997
01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:26.800
shall I call you Ji An and not Eun Seok?

998
01:01:29.235 --> 01:01:30.236
I'm not...

999
01:01:30.804 --> 01:01:32.906
used to all this yet.

1000
01:01:34.474 --> 01:01:36.309
Until the paperwork's complete,

1001
01:01:37.844 --> 01:01:39.145
I'd like you to...

1002
01:01:39.713 --> 01:01:42.082
call me Ji An.

1003
01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:50.423
The choice to return...

1004
01:01:51.491 --> 01:01:53.693
was yours, so do not forget that.

1005
01:01:53.693 --> 01:01:54.761
With choices...

1006
01:01:55.328 --> 01:01:56.863
come responsibilities.

1007
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:59.032
Didn't you think of that?

1008
01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:03.636
Because of you,

1009
01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:05.705
me, your dad, brother, and sister...

1010
01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.674
will all become fodder for gossip.

1011
01:02:09.008 --> 01:02:10.076
If that were to happen,

1012
01:02:12.078 --> 01:02:13.713
you shouldn't have come back.

1013
01:02:32.198 --> 01:02:34.467
I don't know what she's thinking.

1014
01:02:35.101 --> 01:02:36.369
Okay, so keep quiet.

1015
01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.008
Eun Seok.

1016
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:47.280
You can't talk back to Mom and Dad like that.

1017
01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:52.051
Just do as you're told. Is that so hard?

1018
01:02:52.085 --> 01:02:54.721
If I had grown up here like you did,

1019
01:02:55.555 --> 01:02:58.324
it would've been easy to follow the rules.

1020
01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.862
Sorry for making you bother.

1021
01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.302
Ms. Min.

1022
01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:44.737
Everything I brought is gone from my room.

1023
01:03:46.673 --> 01:03:48.975
I took everything by Ms. No's order.

1024
01:03:49.442 --> 01:03:50.810
Where to?

1025
01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:53.112
I threw everything away.

1026
01:03:55.448 --> 01:03:56.683
What do you mean?

1027
01:03:57.183 --> 01:03:59.552
How... How could you do that to my possessions...

1028
01:03:59.552 --> 01:04:01.454
without my permission? They're mine.

1029
01:04:02.055 --> 01:04:03.923
We only did as we were told.

1030
01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:06.492
Where are they? Where do you keep the trash?

1031
01:04:06.893 --> 01:04:08.561
They'll be gone by now.

1032
01:04:23.776 --> 01:04:24.777
What should I do?

1033
01:04:25.311 --> 01:04:27.614
What should I do?

1034
01:05:02.782 --> 01:05:05.285
How could there not be even a single can of beer?

1035
01:05:26.072 --> 01:05:27.073
Seo Ji An.

1036
01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.775
(My Golden Life)

1037
01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:05.545
Is this her?

1038
01:06:06.012 --> 01:06:07.447
I'm Eun Seok.

1039
01:06:08.448 --> 01:06:09.449
That's tomorrow.

1040
01:06:09.449 --> 01:06:10.950
What are you doing with her tomorrow?

1041
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:12.285
It's a secret.

1042
01:06:12.585 --> 01:06:14.387
Hey, Eun Seok!

1043
01:06:15.621 --> 01:06:17.123
Gosh, what am I doing?

1044
01:06:17.123 --> 01:06:18.157
Do Kyung!

1045
01:06:18.157 --> 01:06:19.258
Yes, I'm here!

1046
01:06:19.826 --> 01:06:21.060
What's wrong with her?

1047
01:06:21.094 --> 01:06:22.862
She must've liked you a lot.

1048
01:06:22.929 --> 01:06:25.264
Can't you deliver the bread to the cafe?

1049
01:06:25.264 --> 01:06:26.866
No. I'm the owner.

1050
01:06:26.866 --> 01:06:29.469
Why would I? Gosh.

1051
01:06:29.469 --> 01:06:31.304
I got a call that I became a regular employee...

1052
01:06:31.304 --> 01:06:32.505
for the Marketing Team.
