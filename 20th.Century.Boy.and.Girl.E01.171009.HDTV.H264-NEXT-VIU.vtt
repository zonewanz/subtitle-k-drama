1
00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.836
- How old is she? - Well,

2
00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:11.635
she is as old as I am.

3
00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:16.145
Oh, my.

4
00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:18.616
What would he do?

5
00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:20.345
(1991, when Jin Jin was 9 years old)

6
00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:21.945
They think she's too old.

7
00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:25.316
If she's 29 years old, she's nearly a grandmother.

8
00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:26.586
28 years old?

9
00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:28.586
I never believed I could ever get that old.

10
00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:30.685
It's a problem of life and death.

11
00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:32.456
I know it is important.

12
00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:34.895
But it doesn't matter. I'm a doctor.

13
00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:36.365
I only date women who are all right.

14
00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:40.795
- Gosh, that lipstick is so pretty. - Yes.

15
00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:41.905
- Yes. - Gosh.

16
00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:45.975
I don't think I'll ever get married.

17
00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:47.975
(1997, when Jin Jin was 15 years old)

18
00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:49.505
She's so pretty.

19
00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:51.916
It's not too late.

20
00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:53.475
Oh, my. It is too late.

21
00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:56.685
Do you think it's too late to get married when you're 26 years old?

22
00:00:56.685 --> 00:00:59.856
Yes, I think it's too late.

23
00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.526
- Me too. - Spinster.

24
00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:04.925
I thought spinsters were the poorest things on earth.

25
00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:06.526
- Hey! - Hey!

26
00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:09.726
There's a movie called "Funny Pink".

27
00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:11.565
(2005, when Jin Jin was 23 years old)

28
00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:15.806
"It's harder for women over 30 to date than to die from atomic bombs."

29
00:01:16.065 --> 00:01:19.136
This should be the most famous quote out of all the movies in the world.

30
00:01:19.536 --> 00:01:21.476
There haven't been such lines...

31
00:01:21.476 --> 00:01:23.575
that describe spinsters as they are.

32
00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:25.246
You should go home, wash your feet,

33
00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:29.815
and read this. Don't even dream of getting married.

34
00:01:30.015 --> 00:01:33.315
Hey. Do you pity Sam Soon or me?

35
00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:37.056
Hey, we're still young.

36
00:01:37.996 --> 00:01:39.396
- Right? - Yes.

37
00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:44.636
We thought it was a sin to be 30 and not be married.

38
00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:47.565
We used to think it was true.

39
00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:50.235
I'm done with my exercises today.

40
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.075
Time passed so quickly,

41
00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:55.276
and we became 35 years old.

42
00:01:58.075 --> 00:01:59.476
Park Bo Gum or Song Joong Ki?

43
00:02:00.175 --> 00:02:01.545
Park Bo Gum is more famous.

44
00:02:01.545 --> 00:02:04.146
- I prefer Song Joong Ki. - Sohn Suk Hee or Jung Woo Sung?

45
00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:06.586
- Sohn Suk Hee. - I choose Jung Woo Sung.

46
00:02:07.515 --> 00:02:09.186
You're still too young.

47
00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:13.795
Men should look nice in shirts rather than have nice appearances.

48
00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:16.025
Jung Woo Sung is a model for a suit line.

49
00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:17.966
- What should I do with you? - What?

50
00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:19.436
You're missing the details.

51
00:02:19.436 --> 00:02:20.936
You're missing everything.

52
00:02:21.406 --> 00:02:22.906
What's the most important thing when wearing a shirt?

53
00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:25.136
- Wearing a necktie? - No, definitely not.

54
00:02:26.406 --> 00:02:29.946
I will tell you the answer right now.

55
00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:31.615
The answer is...

56
00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:36.346
the tendon that starts from here to here.

57
00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:38.015
The tendon!

58
00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:41.356
For a man to be sexy, he needs to be a busy man.

59
00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:43.656
He should have a lot of work. His work should be piled up.

60
00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:45.726
But everyone keeps calling him for help.

61
00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:46.955
Do you know why?

62
00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:48.596
It's because he is capable.

63
00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:52.835
Imagine this man unbuttoning his shirt,

64
00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:56.305
rolling up his sleeves, holding a pen,

65
00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:59.136
and concentrating. And at that moment,

66
00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:03.045
you need to look at his beautiful tendon.

67
00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:11.916
And whom do you think I just described?

68
00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:15.325
It's Sohn Suk Hee.

69
00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:20.756
What should I do with you guys?

70
00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:22.596
That's why you are still...

71
00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:27.166
Do you want me to tell you a story?

72
00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.835
Six years ago,

73
00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:31.805
when the spring breeze was...

74
00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:34.545
Hey, didn't you tell me it was summer?

75
00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:39.075
Anyway, what I mean is, your body will all decay in the end.

76
00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:41.446
Stop treasuring it so much.

77
00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:43.085
- What will you do with it? - That's enough.

78
00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:45.316
Let's have the final round.

79
00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:47.825
It has five stars, and it's the most difficult one so far.

80
00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:52.256
Gong Yoo...

81
00:03:56.925 --> 00:03:58.865
or Anthony?

82
00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:05.075
Anthony! Anthony! Anthony!

83
00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:09.075
Anthony! Anthony!

84
00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:11.976
Anthony! Anthony!

85
00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:15.045
Anthony! Anthony!

86
00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:17.346
Anthony, I love him so much.

87
00:04:17.346 --> 00:04:19.086
- Gosh! - Get a hold of yourself.

88
00:04:19.086 --> 00:04:23.026
Living as a 30-year-old woman who is unmarried in 2017?

89
00:04:24.156 --> 00:04:27.195
We don't believe marriage is a happy ending, but it's still the same.

90
00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:32.036
People treat me like a fool and cast disapproving looks that hurt.

91
00:04:32.896 --> 00:04:34.305
But I won't blame myself.

92
00:04:35.235 --> 00:04:37.976
Today was great, and I look forward to tomorrow.

93
00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:43.606
Whoever is listening to my story, I hope you will feel the same.

94
00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:47.545
Yes, I'm talking about you.

95
00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:05.135
(The first story)

96
00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:09.536
(The Boy We Loved Back Then)

97
00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:14.675
Someone with the phone number 8244 sent us a question.

98
00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:18.815
"Anthony, do you like people who look like cats or dogs?"

99
00:05:21.416 --> 00:05:22.646
I...

100
00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:24.555
I like people who look like dogs.

101
00:05:24.555 --> 00:05:25.786
- Dogs? - Yes.

102
00:05:25.786 --> 00:05:27.685
You took some time to think.

103
00:05:27.925 --> 00:05:29.555
Number 7066 asked,

104
00:05:29.956 --> 00:05:31.995
"You took some time to think."

105
00:05:31.995 --> 00:05:33.026
Are you happy?

106
00:05:33.026 --> 00:05:34.925
"Do you always have a lot of concerns?"

107
00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:38.435
Do I look like a cat or a dog?

108
00:05:38.435 --> 00:05:40.466
- You? - Don't I look like a dog?

109
00:05:41.805 --> 00:05:42.836
You...

110
00:05:43.565 --> 00:05:44.935
are just ugly.

111
00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:49.045
Your manager is here!

112
00:06:30.416 --> 00:06:33.916
Gosh, she's so pretty.

113
00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:35.985
Whose daughter is that?

114
00:06:38.295 --> 00:06:39.396
Welcome.

115
00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:40.755
Hey, pretty lady.

116
00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.526
That girl over there...

117
00:06:43.526 --> 00:06:45.596
What was her name again?

118
00:06:45.596 --> 00:06:48.766
- Do you mean Sa Jin Jin? - Yes, Sa Jin Jin.

119
00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:51.505
I don't know who her mother is, but I envy her.

120
00:06:52.235 --> 00:06:55.505
She comes here often with her mother. They live nearby.

121
00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:57.945
- Really? - Yes.

122
00:06:57.945 --> 00:07:00.045
I haven't seen her,

123
00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:03.185
but they say her mother looks nothing like her.

124
00:07:03.416 --> 00:07:06.185
I don't know if I should say this, but she's said to be mean-looking.

125
00:07:07.216 --> 00:07:08.826
You don't know anything.

126
00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:10.786
You don't know how kind she is.

127
00:07:12.596 --> 00:07:14.226
Yes, of course.

128
00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:17.026
Are you looking for something in particular?

129
00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:20.596
Can we get the lipstick that Sa Jin Jin is advertising?

130
00:07:20.596 --> 00:07:22.106
Do you want to try them?

131
00:07:22.336 --> 00:07:23.836
- Come inside. - Yes, of course.

132
00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:28.505
- Let's just try them on. - Gosh.

133
00:07:30.045 --> 00:07:31.545
Hello!

134
00:07:32.216 --> 00:07:33.516
Chang Wan,

135
00:07:34.385 --> 00:07:36.245
I'd like some cool beer.

136
00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:38.115
Did you go hiking?

137
00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:40.586
What would I do at home?

138
00:07:42.055 --> 00:07:45.026
- Have you heard about this? - What?

139
00:07:45.026 --> 00:07:48.795
The most expensive dish is made by your wife who makes you feel guilty.

140
00:07:48.795 --> 00:07:50.995
Be thankful that she cooks for you every time.

141
00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:52.565
She made me curry.

142
00:07:52.565 --> 00:07:55.706
It's not like we're Indian.

143
00:07:55.706 --> 00:07:57.635
Wait. I'll fry you some chicken.

144
00:07:57.635 --> 00:07:59.675
Gosh, thank you.

145
00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:02.706
Here you go.

146
00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:06.776
You've gotten quite old. You should stop working.

147
00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:09.745
The only thing I can do is fry chicken.

148
00:08:09.745 --> 00:08:12.216
I should work hard when I still can.

149
00:08:12.216 --> 00:08:14.985
You have a successful daughter. Why do you worry so much?

150
00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:16.625
Her money isn't mine.

151
00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:20.026
Do you mean she'll keep all her money?

152
00:08:20.026 --> 00:08:23.365
It's up to her to decide what she does with it.

153
00:08:23.365 --> 00:08:25.435
Goodness, Chang Wan.

154
00:08:25.435 --> 00:08:28.536
Are you simply kind or foolish?

155
00:08:29.906 --> 00:08:32.735
Why did you cover up your beautiful daughter?

156
00:08:32.735 --> 00:08:34.706
Leave it alone.

157
00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:42.015
(Double the thrilling taste, beer that's only for you)

158
00:08:46.155 --> 00:08:48.326
Sa Jin Jin probably lives on morning dew.

159
00:08:48.785 --> 00:08:50.625
She's my ideal type.

160
00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:53.826
I've been her fan for a long time...

161
00:08:53.826 --> 00:08:55.566
since she was an idol singer.

162
00:08:55.566 --> 00:08:56.726
That's right.

163
00:08:56.726 --> 00:08:59.735
Everyone, please calm down.

164
00:08:59.836 --> 00:09:02.206
It's Wednesday with the master of popular idol singers.

165
00:09:02.206 --> 00:09:03.405
Is it Law of Love segment?

166
00:09:03.405 --> 00:09:05.275
No, it's not. It's more like...

167
00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:08.645
Sa Jin Jin's fan meeting today.

168
00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:12.476
Are you listening to us, Sa Jin Jin? If you are...

169
00:09:12.476 --> 00:09:15.115
Peekaboo. She's right here.

170
00:09:15.115 --> 00:09:16.846
I'm so jealous.

171
00:09:17.586 --> 00:09:20.015
There's a line of men waiting for you.

172
00:09:20.015 --> 00:09:21.655
You have nothing to lose.

173
00:09:22.086 --> 00:09:24.255
If we reveal all the text messages that you received,

174
00:09:24.255 --> 00:09:26.356
all the girls will have a fit.

175
00:09:26.356 --> 00:09:28.495
Please tune in right away.

176
00:09:28.495 --> 00:09:31.035
Every Wednesday,

177
00:09:31.035 --> 00:09:34.365
many of Jin Jin's fans are waiting.

178
00:09:34.566 --> 00:09:37.905
If you're listening to our show, please visit us.

179
00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:40.235
Why don't we listen to a song?

180
00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:41.346
That sounds good.

181
00:09:41.346 --> 00:09:44.775
Let's go back to the time when Jin Jin was an idol singer.

182
00:09:44.775 --> 00:09:46.775
It's "Lovely Day" by Daeri Girls.

183
00:09:46.775 --> 00:09:49.515
- Here it is. - I love this song.

184
00:09:50.686 --> 00:09:52.915
(Sa Jin Jin, the Highest Value in the Market)

185
00:09:52.915 --> 00:09:55.785
- What's FA? - Why?

186
00:09:56.785 --> 00:09:59.426
- It's related to baseball players. - Do you play baseball?

187
00:10:00.056 --> 00:10:02.196
In the headline, it says...

188
00:10:02.495 --> 00:10:04.495
"Sa Jin Jin, the Highest Value in the Market."

189
00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:06.096
"Will she be on FA Market?"

190
00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:08.905
What does it mean?

191
00:10:10.405 --> 00:10:12.375
Hong Hee, do you have the draft?

192
00:10:12.806 --> 00:10:14.446
(President Jang Ki Bong)

193
00:10:20.676 --> 00:10:21.885
Hello, Reporter Yoon.

194
00:10:23.015 --> 00:10:25.485
Yes, the contract has ended.

195
00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:29.155
All the agencies want to work with Jin Jin.

196
00:10:29.686 --> 00:10:31.395
I'm aware of the offers.

197
00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:33.495
I know that they're aggressive.

198
00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:36.865
How would I know if she'll take them?

199
00:10:36.865 --> 00:10:39.836
The decision is completely up to the actress.

200
00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:43.005
(After using the makeup, notice the changes in the skin.)

201
00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:45.505
Why are there two models for the makeup?

202
00:10:45.905 --> 00:10:47.135
Is President Jang behind this?

203
00:10:47.135 --> 00:10:50.005
- He may offer it to Jeong Da Yeong. - Stop it.

204
00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:54.346
Da Yeong's skin is terrible.

205
00:10:57.515 --> 00:10:58.915
- Which one is it? - Park Myeong Soo.

206
00:10:58.915 --> 00:11:00.615
It startled me.

207
00:11:00.686 --> 00:11:02.655
- One. - Jung Si Eun.

208
00:11:04.025 --> 00:11:05.296
- Jung Si Eun. - Jung Si Eun.

209
00:11:06.356 --> 00:11:08.765
- Everyone. - Look, it's Sa Jin Jin.

210
00:11:09.296 --> 00:11:10.525
This is unbelievable.

211
00:11:12.535 --> 00:11:14.405
- Hey. - Yes?

212
00:11:14.606 --> 00:11:17.336
- Did you see that? - It's different indeed.

213
00:11:17.336 --> 00:11:20.875
The level and the sizes are very different.

214
00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:24.245
- Right? - But I'm not familiar with it.

215
00:11:24.245 --> 00:11:26.076
You should talk to our president.

216
00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:27.915
Our president already knows.

217
00:11:27.915 --> 00:11:29.846
Really? Our boss does?

218
00:11:29.846 --> 00:11:31.415
Of course.

219
00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:33.615
Everyone knows that Sa Jin Jin is always on time.

220
00:11:33.615 --> 00:11:35.155
She doesn't exercise in the car.

221
00:11:35.155 --> 00:11:38.456
She doesn't waste her energy since she's the top.

222
00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:39.926
- Hey! - What?

223
00:11:39.926 --> 00:11:43.966
I was talking about Sa Jin Jin's van. Her van.

224
00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:46.296
- Van? - I want to...

225
00:11:46.296 --> 00:11:47.966
ride that van.

226
00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:54.606
The makeup and hairstylist managers are in the studio.

227
00:11:55.905 --> 00:11:58.046
We should have brought more staff.

228
00:11:58.046 --> 00:12:00.615
I bet Jeong Da Yeong brought a huge crew.

229
00:12:01.645 --> 00:12:03.716
Hello, Director Cho.

230
00:12:03.716 --> 00:12:06.586
We're almost there. We are...

231
00:12:06.985 --> 00:12:10.485
- Gangnam. - Dosan Intersection.

232
00:12:10.485 --> 00:12:12.995
We'll be right there. See you.

233
00:12:12.995 --> 00:12:14.995
- Director Cho. - Yes, sir.

234
00:12:14.995 --> 00:12:16.025
Where's Jeong Da Yeong?

235
00:12:16.025 --> 00:12:18.665
They've been saying for an hour that they're close.

236
00:12:18.665 --> 00:12:20.395
Do they consider me a fool?

237
00:12:20.395 --> 00:12:22.635
They aren't even good liars.

238
00:12:23.405 --> 00:12:26.635
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

239
00:12:26.635 --> 00:12:28.976
- I'm so sorry. - I'm sorry.

240
00:12:28.976 --> 00:12:30.846
I'm so sorry, director.

241
00:12:30.846 --> 00:12:34.015
My manager woke up late today.

242
00:12:34.415 --> 00:12:35.785
You should do better.

243
00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:40.155
- Gosh, I'm sorry. - Sorry.

244
00:12:42.226 --> 00:12:44.956
Goodness. Hello, Jin Jin.

245
00:12:44.956 --> 00:12:47.995
I'm sorry. I'll hurry.

246
00:12:48.495 --> 00:12:49.665
Excuse me.

247
00:12:59.689 --> 00:13:02.921
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E01 20th Century Boy & Girl "The Boy We Loved Back Then"</font>

248
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:14.485
Da Yeong, you should get changed.

249
00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:16.726
Okay.

250
00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:21.495
By the way, director.

251
00:13:21.495 --> 00:13:23.066
Take a look at me.

252
00:13:23.066 --> 00:13:26.066
This dress has a beautiful neckline...

253
00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:27.765
for the collarbone.

254
00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:30.765
I have a beautiful neck and collarbone.

255
00:13:30.765 --> 00:13:31.976
Da Yeong.

256
00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:34.245
I can hold water in here too.

257
00:13:36.046 --> 00:13:39.176
Come on.

258
00:13:39.176 --> 00:13:41.546
Just take a look at me.

259
00:13:41.546 --> 00:13:43.415
- I put a lot of thought into it. - Jeong Da Yeong.

260
00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:47.485
Let's hurry up the shoot so we can leave. Okay?

261
00:13:49.785 --> 00:13:50.895
Okay, Jin Jin.

262
00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:02.436
- Whitening. - Instant anti-aging.

263
00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:05.505
It's the only masterpiece for beauty.

264
00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:10.405
Cut. Okay.

265
00:14:10.405 --> 00:14:12.115
- Thank you. - Thank you.

266
00:14:12.115 --> 00:14:13.615
- Thank you. - Thank you.

267
00:14:13.615 --> 00:14:16.415
- See you later. - You did a great job today.

268
00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:18.985
- Thank you. - Thank you, everyone.

269
00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:20.586
- Goodbye. - See you again.

270
00:14:20.586 --> 00:14:22.326
Good job today.

271
00:14:22.326 --> 00:14:24.556
Thank you, everyone.

272
00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:29.895
Aren't you hot?

273
00:14:29.895 --> 00:14:32.566
- I am. - I'm so hot.

274
00:14:32.566 --> 00:14:35.235
- Where are my slippers? - I'll bring them from the car.

275
00:14:35.235 --> 00:14:36.706
- Wait. - What?

276
00:14:44.346 --> 00:14:46.846
Take a seat, and put them on. You did a good job.

277
00:14:46.846 --> 00:14:49.346
- You're hot, aren't you? - Yes.

278
00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:51.186
They don't turn on the air conditioner.

279
00:14:51.186 --> 00:14:54.255
- I had a hard time today. - I know.

280
00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:56.326
What do you want to eat?

281
00:14:56.326 --> 00:14:57.726
You did a great job.

282
00:14:58.525 --> 00:15:00.255
- Thank you. - Thank you.

283
00:15:00.255 --> 00:15:01.895
- Da Yeong. - Goodbye.

284
00:15:01.895 --> 00:15:03.995
- See you again. - Thank you for your work.

285
00:15:03.995 --> 00:15:05.235
Da Yeong.

286
00:15:16.676 --> 00:15:18.076
Go to her now.

287
00:15:18.546 --> 00:15:19.745
Hurry.

288
00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:34.966
I was wrong. I thought your eyelashes came off.

289
00:15:35.765 --> 00:15:37.635
Goodness.

290
00:15:38.066 --> 00:15:41.405
- By the way, do you know this? - Pardon?

291
00:15:41.765 --> 00:15:44.436
A star who was cursed after acting like a brat.

292
00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:45.606
What?

293
00:15:45.606 --> 00:15:49.106
A star. A star in the sky.

294
00:15:51.245 --> 00:15:52.615
You don't know, do you?

295
00:15:52.716 --> 00:15:55.216
Look up Cassiopeia.

296
00:16:00.316 --> 00:16:03.356
"A constellation in the northern sky,"

297
00:16:03.356 --> 00:16:05.125
"Cassiopeia,"

298
00:16:05.125 --> 00:16:07.056
"was a queen of Ethiopia."

299
00:16:07.765 --> 00:16:10.525
"She was arrogant and full of greed."

300
00:16:10.525 --> 00:16:12.296
"After enraging Poseidon,"

301
00:16:12.296 --> 00:16:16.865
"she was placed upside-down on a chair in the sky as a punishment."

302
00:16:17.165 --> 00:16:18.775
How did you know about it?

303
00:16:18.875 --> 00:16:20.905
I saw it on "Surprise".

304
00:16:38.995 --> 00:16:40.426
Gosh.

305
00:16:49.566 --> 00:16:51.005
My goodness.

306
00:16:51.336 --> 00:16:54.806
If I ever drink again,

307
00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:58.245
it means that I have no common sense.

308
00:16:58.245 --> 00:16:59.476
(Young Shim)

309
00:16:59.476 --> 00:17:00.816
(Hello...)

310
00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:02.716
How's your stomach, Ah Reum?

311
00:17:02.716 --> 00:17:04.255
(This is applicant Jang Young Shim.)

312
00:17:04.255 --> 00:17:05.385
By the way,

313
00:17:05.385 --> 00:17:10.326
how can Jin Jin love Anthony and Anthony only?

314
00:17:12.425 --> 00:17:14.566
"Anthony". Gosh.

315
00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:16.296
Why doesn't she ask him out?

316
00:17:16.296 --> 00:17:17.895
She's more popular than he is.

317
00:17:18.435 --> 00:17:22.536
She'll complain about his ideal type of women.

318
00:17:25.776 --> 00:17:27.475
There's no greater star than you.

319
00:17:28.145 --> 00:17:29.746
She must be pretty, kind,

320
00:17:29.746 --> 00:17:30.975
educated, and from a good family.

321
00:17:30.975 --> 00:17:32.816
She must be able to support you.

322
00:17:32.816 --> 00:17:34.316
She can't be a celebrity or a star.

323
00:17:34.316 --> 00:17:36.215
You must meet an amazing woman.

324
00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:39.986
When you're 80.

325
00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:44.026
Do you think...

326
00:17:44.185 --> 00:17:46.455
she suffers from Bongo's Curse?

327
00:17:46.895 --> 00:17:50.425
She's the great Sa Jin Jin. I just don't get it.

328
00:17:50.826 --> 00:17:52.836
You can never understand a fangirl.

329
00:17:52.836 --> 00:17:54.365
She's just incredible.

330
00:17:54.736 --> 00:17:56.365
It's been 20 years, right?

331
00:17:57.435 --> 00:17:59.306
Even a fairy tale character would give in.

332
00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:02.175
Poor her.

333
00:18:02.405 --> 00:18:03.905
We're all the same.

334
00:18:04.675 --> 00:18:06.915
Today? Hanoi.

335
00:18:06.915 --> 00:18:10.986
Forget the flight. I wish I could have a nice bowl of pho.

336
00:18:12.016 --> 00:18:14.925
Yes. Okay, I'll get you some coffee.

337
00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:24.026
Hello, Ms. Han.

338
00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:26.296
I'm Lee Dong Hoon, a co-pilot.

339
00:18:26.496 --> 00:18:28.306
We flew to Sapporo last month.

340
00:18:30.205 --> 00:18:33.635
Flight 102 to Sapporo will last 2 hours and 10 minutes.

341
00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:36.846
We will leave Gate 36 at 2pm...

342
00:18:37.506 --> 00:18:40.516
and land in Sapporo at 4:20pm local time.

343
00:18:40.915 --> 00:18:42.915
189 seats were reserved.

344
00:18:42.915 --> 00:18:45.915
We will fly at an altitude of 37,000 feet.

345
00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:49.155
Due to weather and jet streams, for 40 minutes after takeoff,

346
00:18:49.455 --> 00:18:50.925
there will be some turbulence.

347
00:18:51.195 --> 00:18:55.225
If the turbulence is severe, we'll light the seat belt sign twice.

348
00:18:55.266 --> 00:18:57.425
The weather here and at our destination...

349
00:18:57.425 --> 00:18:59.135
is less than optimal.

350
00:18:59.635 --> 00:19:02.635
Incheon Airport's security level is yellow,

351
00:19:03.135 --> 00:19:06.836
so as soon as the plane comes in, do a thorough check.

352
00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:09.375
- He's cute. - Today's secret security code...

353
00:19:09.475 --> 00:19:10.705
is "blue horse".

354
00:19:13.846 --> 00:19:16.685
You're that co-pilot. Hello.

355
00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:22.786
Are you flying to Hanoi today?

356
00:19:23.086 --> 00:19:24.655
I overheard you talking.

357
00:19:25.796 --> 00:19:28.296
- Yes. - Me too.

358
00:19:29.195 --> 00:19:33.096
I see. Please ensure we get a smooth landing.

359
00:19:33.096 --> 00:19:34.365
I will.

360
00:19:39.606 --> 00:19:41.046
What is this?

361
00:19:49.415 --> 00:19:50.615
Why won't you eat?

362
00:19:51.715 --> 00:19:52.955
Are you on a diet?

363
00:19:55.655 --> 00:19:56.756
Good idea.

364
00:19:57.455 --> 00:19:59.556
Other people take diet pills.

365
00:19:59.556 --> 00:20:01.395
Eat first, talk later.

366
00:20:03.026 --> 00:20:04.266
I'm done.

367
00:20:08.435 --> 00:20:11.006
Why does my stomach keep coming out?

368
00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:16.945
What did you want to say?

369
00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:22.986
Hong Kong.

370
00:20:23.986 --> 00:20:25.756
- You know. - A variety show?

371
00:20:25.856 --> 00:20:27.185
VP Nam.

372
00:20:27.725 --> 00:20:29.756
He helped you debut.

373
00:20:29.756 --> 00:20:32.856
He looked out for us since we started in that tiny office.

374
00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:34.566
He did so much for you.

375
00:20:35.096 --> 00:20:36.996
He's on the verge of losing his job.

376
00:20:37.225 --> 00:20:40.036
He wants you on your first variety show in 10 years.

377
00:20:40.965 --> 00:20:43.705
- Let's help him out. - I'm not funny.

378
00:20:43.705 --> 00:20:44.806
You are funny.

379
00:20:45.006 --> 00:20:46.175
Come on.

380
00:20:46.306 --> 00:20:47.975
Do you want to go on a talkshow?

381
00:20:48.175 --> 00:20:50.945
Or wear a mask and sing in front of a crowd?

382
00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:54.715
Wouldn't it be better to go to Hong Kong and chat for a while?

383
00:20:55.685 --> 00:20:58.155
- Give me the script. - That's old school.

384
00:20:58.455 --> 00:21:00.155
They don't have scripts these days.

385
00:21:00.155 --> 00:21:02.326
- What do I do then? - Just wing it.

386
00:21:02.526 --> 00:21:04.496
Don't think something up...

387
00:21:04.655 --> 00:21:07.225
and try to be haughty or act strange.

388
00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:08.996
People hate that these days.

389
00:21:08.996 --> 00:21:10.195
Are you afraid I'll flop?

390
00:21:11.365 --> 00:21:14.566
Look at you. I know you'll do just fine.

391
00:21:16.635 --> 00:21:18.506
Spend the night in Hong Kong,

392
00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.546
and take a break, okay?

393
00:21:24.546 --> 00:21:26.316
- Okay. - Okay.

394
00:21:37.326 --> 00:21:39.455
I'm Kim Gi Min from Morning Calm Entertainment.

395
00:21:39.455 --> 00:21:41.096
I'd like to offer you a contract.

396
00:21:41.225 --> 00:21:43.165
I'll wait to hear from you.

397
00:21:45.036 --> 00:21:46.195
Is it a guy?

398
00:21:46.766 --> 00:21:48.036
No.

399
00:21:49.606 --> 00:21:51.006
Tell me first.

400
00:21:51.405 --> 00:21:54.645
I need to know if I'm to do damage control.

401
00:21:54.645 --> 00:21:56.076
It's not like that.

402
00:22:02.385 --> 00:22:03.445
(Jeong Da Yeong)

403
00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:06.615
What do you think about her?

404
00:22:10.256 --> 00:22:11.455
She's pretty.

405
00:22:13.955 --> 00:22:15.425
Is that why you crushed her?

406
00:22:15.796 --> 00:22:18.195
- What? - You embarrassed her.

407
00:22:18.736 --> 00:22:22.236
She cried so much that her eyes puffed up.

408
00:22:22.435 --> 00:22:25.106
You can't do that to young kids.

409
00:22:25.405 --> 00:22:26.736
Is that what she said?

410
00:22:26.736 --> 00:22:29.346
Why? Will you go back and chew her out?

411
00:22:31.746 --> 00:22:33.715
That's what old people do.

412
00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:37.316
Don't lecture others just because you've been around a while.

413
00:22:43.326 --> 00:22:44.596
Good job.

414
00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:46.826
- Take care. - Get some rest.

415
00:22:49.865 --> 00:22:52.365
Do you want to go to the night market later?

416
00:22:52.536 --> 00:22:54.536
- Sure. - Do you like banh mi?

417
00:22:54.635 --> 00:22:56.865
I found a famous place between the locals.

418
00:22:57.875 --> 00:22:58.975
Ms. Han.

419
00:22:59.306 --> 00:23:00.536
Ms. Han.

420
00:23:03.246 --> 00:23:04.576
You did great today.

421
00:23:04.615 --> 00:23:06.746
Thanks. You too.

422
00:23:08.615 --> 00:23:11.256
Would you mind giving me...

423
00:23:12.016 --> 00:23:13.185
your number?

424
00:23:14.756 --> 00:23:16.225
Buy me some beer.

425
00:23:19.756 --> 00:23:21.496
Sure. Why not?

426
00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:36.606
That's mine.

427
00:23:40.816 --> 00:23:42.346
This is for you.

428
00:23:47.415 --> 00:23:50.786
(Chocolate gift box meaning)

429
00:23:53.155 --> 00:23:54.596
What's going on?

430
00:23:56.165 --> 00:23:58.465
(Chocolate: I love you)

431
00:24:02.836 --> 00:24:04.875
Let's go to the night market.

432
00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:06.975
Ms. Han.

433
00:24:07.006 --> 00:24:09.276
The night market's the least of our worries.

434
00:24:10.076 --> 00:24:12.145
What'll you do about this?

435
00:24:13.346 --> 00:24:17.346
- What? - You two shot lasers at each other.

436
00:24:17.715 --> 00:24:19.115
I got it right away.

437
00:24:20.486 --> 00:24:21.556
I think...

438
00:24:22.685 --> 00:24:24.625
this is exactly that.

439
00:24:24.856 --> 00:24:26.395
- What? - Flirting.

440
00:24:38.205 --> 00:24:40.836
(Incheon Airport)

441
00:25:04.996 --> 00:25:06.465
What are you doing?

442
00:25:06.536 --> 00:25:07.806
News flash.

443
00:25:08.106 --> 00:25:10.365
- I'm getting married. - What?

444
00:25:10.566 --> 00:25:13.336
I need to go to the hospital. Where's Young Shim? I'll be brief.

445
00:25:13.336 --> 00:25:15.046
It's okay. Get in.

446
00:25:21.145 --> 00:25:22.846
How far along are you?

447
00:25:24.145 --> 00:25:26.715
28 weeks. 8 months.

448
00:25:27.586 --> 00:25:29.425
- Still a way to go, then. - Yes.

449
00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:34.566
The fibroid is in a bad spot.

450
00:25:34.796 --> 00:25:38.865
There are four sized 6cm near your bladder.

451
00:25:40.365 --> 00:25:42.465
- Was your period irregular? - Yes.

452
00:25:43.836 --> 00:25:44.905
Doctor.

453
00:25:45.776 --> 00:25:48.546
Will I be an old mom even if I get pregnant today?

454
00:25:49.346 --> 00:25:52.516
Some women have their first babies in their 50s.

455
00:25:53.445 --> 00:25:56.586
Once you get the fibroids out and make a full recovery,

456
00:25:56.586 --> 00:25:58.715
you can get pregnant and have a child no problem.

457
00:25:58.715 --> 00:25:59.885
Okay.

458
00:26:00.486 --> 00:26:03.086
You'll be admitted in 2 days for 4 nights and 5 days.

459
00:26:03.086 --> 00:26:04.756
The surgery will be in three days.

460
00:26:05.125 --> 00:26:06.856
Have you had sex before?

461
00:26:09.596 --> 00:26:11.336
Yes, I have.

462
00:26:13.895 --> 00:26:17.336
Okay, so my first goal is...

463
00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:20.336
to get physical. To have a physical conversation.

464
00:26:20.635 --> 00:26:22.806
You're getting ahead of yourself.

465
00:26:22.846 --> 00:26:25.875
Not this time. A flight attendant noticed it first.

466
00:26:25.875 --> 00:26:28.286
So what? Did he call you?

467
00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:30.715
No. I'm playing hard to get.

468
00:26:30.816 --> 00:26:33.115
No. He isn't into you.

469
00:26:33.115 --> 00:26:36.056
No. He's afraid of the social prejudice.

470
00:26:36.286 --> 00:26:38.195
He's seven years younger.

471
00:26:38.195 --> 00:26:40.455
A man makes a beeline for a woman he likes.

472
00:26:40.455 --> 00:26:41.725
He never confuses her.

473
00:26:42.096 --> 00:26:44.935
This is why when a veteran fights a novice,

474
00:26:44.935 --> 00:26:46.996
- the novice wins. - What?

475
00:26:46.996 --> 00:26:50.566
The rules of flirting are completely different.

476
00:26:50.566 --> 00:26:52.405
Why try to fit it to a script?

477
00:26:52.606 --> 00:26:54.546
I will show you both.

478
00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:56.776
Just wait until my operation's done.

479
00:26:57.205 --> 00:26:58.915
Do you have his photo?

480
00:26:58.915 --> 00:27:00.016
No.

481
00:27:01.016 --> 00:27:03.645
Oh, he looks like that guy.

482
00:27:04.816 --> 00:27:06.016
Jung Woo Sung.

483
00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:10.385
Bongo Man? The face genius?

484
00:27:14.296 --> 00:27:16.895
My name is Jung Woo Sung.

485
00:27:16.895 --> 00:27:18.165
(Jung Woo Sung)

486
00:27:18.965 --> 00:27:20.266
Him?

487
00:27:21.266 --> 00:27:23.536
He was so cool when he spoke in that dialect.

488
00:27:23.536 --> 00:27:24.675
Him?

489
00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:26.736
He said he liked me.

490
00:27:26.736 --> 00:27:29.175
What are you saying? He liked me.

491
00:27:29.175 --> 00:27:31.276
- Don't say that. - It's true.

492
00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:33.076
- What? - I'm serious.

493
00:27:33.615 --> 00:27:34.715
Hey.

494
00:27:35.086 --> 00:27:36.346
Do you remember?

495
00:27:36.546 --> 00:27:40.516
We once nearly ended our relationship because of a man.

496
00:27:41.086 --> 00:27:42.225
- Right? - When?

497
00:27:43.986 --> 00:27:46.256
- We look great here. Look at this. - Show me.

498
00:27:46.256 --> 00:27:47.425
Show me.

499
00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:49.596
- This looks great. - I like this one and that one.

500
00:27:50.195 --> 00:27:52.736
- We look great here. - I'm not in that one.

501
00:27:53.165 --> 00:27:55.865
- We look great here. - Let me see.

502
00:27:55.865 --> 00:27:58.506
- See? - Only you look good here.

503
00:27:58.506 --> 00:28:00.675
That's all we need.

504
00:28:00.675 --> 00:28:03.375
Hey, my legs look so fat here.

505
00:28:03.475 --> 00:28:04.975
- Hey! - Hey!

506
00:28:04.975 --> 00:28:07.615
- My legs are worse. - You're too thin to say that.

507
00:28:08.016 --> 00:28:10.215
Hey, I look really weird here.

508
00:28:10.215 --> 00:28:13.316
- You really do. - You look angry here.

509
00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:14.685
- No. - You do.

510
00:28:14.685 --> 00:28:16.526
- Gosh. - I'll pick this one.

511
00:28:16.526 --> 00:28:19.026
- Don't do that. - Don't write your name.

512
00:28:19.925 --> 00:28:22.195
- Hey! - Hey, wait.

513
00:28:22.195 --> 00:28:23.625
- Hey. - Gosh.

514
00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:28.606
- Those shoes... - He always wear those shoes.

515
00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:30.465
- I saw this every day. - Me too.

516
00:28:30.465 --> 00:28:31.536
Does he even wash them?

517
00:28:31.536 --> 00:28:33.276
- No. - No.

518
00:28:41.846 --> 00:28:45.115
(11046 Han Ah Reum)

519
00:28:45.115 --> 00:28:48.155
(11027 Jang Young Shim)

520
00:28:48.155 --> 00:28:52.195
(11031 Sa Jin Jin)

521
00:28:55.225 --> 00:28:57.895
Yes, we did.

522
00:28:58.465 --> 00:29:01.536
- We wrote something then. - Yes.

523
00:29:01.836 --> 00:29:03.566
Why doesn't this work?

524
00:29:08.076 --> 00:29:10.975
Guys, I bought a camera. I'll take pictures of you. Come out.

525
00:29:10.975 --> 00:29:12.546
- Yes! - Yes!

526
00:29:13.576 --> 00:29:15.246
- Here. - Thanks.

527
00:29:15.246 --> 00:29:17.415
Come outside. Stop right there.

528
00:29:17.415 --> 00:29:18.955
Come outside quickly.

529
00:29:19.455 --> 00:29:20.556
(Pledge Written in Blood)

530
00:29:20.556 --> 00:29:22.155
- Han Ah Reum... - Sa Jin Jin...

531
00:29:22.155 --> 00:29:23.225
And Jang Young Shim...

532
00:29:23.256 --> 00:29:26.895
- promise never to fight over men... - Promise never to fight over men...

533
00:29:26.895 --> 00:29:29.195
- and will be friends forever. - and will be friends forever.

534
00:29:29.526 --> 00:29:32.096
It's not valid now. Let's just hope someone gets married.

535
00:29:32.096 --> 00:29:34.465
Yes, you should go first.

536
00:29:34.465 --> 00:29:38.276
I will get married when I meet a thick guy.

537
00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:39.506
That's how men should be.

538
00:29:39.506 --> 00:29:41.645
Why do you care about the thickness?

539
00:29:42.246 --> 00:29:44.006
You won't know even if I tell you.

540
00:29:44.006 --> 00:29:47.586
You haven't felt the weight of a man yet, so you won't know.

541
00:30:06.236 --> 00:30:13.776
- Please look over here. - Please look over here.

542
00:30:13.776 --> 00:30:16.375
- Another pose, please. - Please look over here.

543
00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:18.776
- Sa Jin Jin, over here. - Please look over here.

544
00:30:18.776 --> 00:30:20.776
- Please look over here. - You're so pretty.

545
00:30:20.776 --> 00:30:22.885
- Please look over here. - Please look over here.

546
00:30:23.246 --> 00:30:25.655
- Please look over here. - Please look over here.

547
00:30:25.655 --> 00:30:28.026
- Look over here. - Sa Jin Jin.

548
00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:29.155
- Please look over here. - Sa Jin Jin.

549
00:30:30.725 --> 00:30:32.625
Jin Jin, where are you going?

550
00:30:33.225 --> 00:30:35.096
I'm going to Hong Kong to shoot a variety show.

551
00:30:35.096 --> 00:30:37.965
You haven't been on a variety show for a while. Everyone is waiting.

552
00:30:37.965 --> 00:30:40.865
Gosh, my face looks so fat.

553
00:30:41.135 --> 00:30:42.935
Gosh, you look so thin.

554
00:30:42.935 --> 00:30:44.975
What's your fashion concept today?

555
00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:48.806
- Gosh, that's my cellphone. - It's a "see-through look".

556
00:30:48.806 --> 00:30:49.846
- Really? - Yes.

557
00:30:49.846 --> 00:30:51.276
You look pretty.

558
00:30:51.276 --> 00:30:54.046
You look prettier every day. Are you dating someone?

559
00:30:54.286 --> 00:30:56.046
I wish I could.

560
00:30:57.415 --> 00:30:59.786
- Mi Dal, come quickly. - If you ever date someone,

561
00:30:59.786 --> 00:31:01.786
- Wait a moment! - please tell us.

562
00:31:01.786 --> 00:31:02.955
- Jin Jin! - Yes.

563
00:31:02.955 --> 00:31:04.225
Promise?

564
00:31:04.225 --> 00:31:05.256
(Jin Jin, call us if you ever date someone.)

565
00:31:05.725 --> 00:31:08.596
Oh gosh.

566
00:31:10.725 --> 00:31:13.096
I still have a 30-month-long monthly installment plan left.

567
00:31:13.096 --> 00:31:14.905
I must have been out of my mind.

568
00:31:14.905 --> 00:31:16.266
You are driving me crazy too.

569
00:31:16.266 --> 00:31:19.236
Why did they tell me to share a room with you? There's only one bed.

570
00:31:19.236 --> 00:31:22.405
I don't feel like joking around.

571
00:31:33.215 --> 00:31:34.885
Please turn off the light.

572
00:31:43.566 --> 00:31:45.195
You should sleep on the bed.

573
00:31:47.865 --> 00:31:49.806
Let's sleep in the same bed.

574
00:31:57.246 --> 00:31:59.276
Let's not sleep right next to each other.

575
00:32:07.185 --> 00:32:10.425
Oh, my. This is what Hong Kong looks like at night.

576
00:32:10.425 --> 00:32:12.026
It's so beautiful.

577
00:32:41.685 --> 00:32:43.625
- Hello. - Where to?

578
00:32:43.625 --> 00:32:45.556
- Zhong Wan, please. - All right.

579
00:32:56.165 --> 00:32:58.175
This is not a distressed asset.

580
00:32:58.175 --> 00:33:01.046
But still, we should monitor the Chinese market further.

581
00:33:01.905 --> 00:33:03.306
Yes, that is correct.

582
00:33:08.415 --> 00:33:09.945
- Good morning, guys. - Good morning.

583
00:33:09.945 --> 00:33:12.955
Samantha, whatever Nick says, don't listen to him.

584
00:33:12.955 --> 00:33:15.056
- What? - Hey.

585
00:33:15.056 --> 00:33:16.155
Good morning, people.

586
00:33:16.155 --> 00:33:18.225
- Good morning. - Good morning.

587
00:33:18.326 --> 00:33:19.425
Hey, Jimmy.

588
00:33:19.425 --> 00:33:22.225
- Look closely. Always double check. - Okay.

589
00:33:36.705 --> 00:33:40.246
For now, most of the Chinese markets are slightly unstable.

590
00:33:40.246 --> 00:33:43.016
Yes, I understand. But I guarantee it's going to be fine soon.

591
00:33:43.016 --> 00:33:47.016
So actually we don't need... Tim, hold on a second.

592
00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:49.056
This is Gong speaking.

593
00:33:49.056 --> 00:33:51.356
2.15 percent going down.

594
00:33:52.326 --> 00:33:53.526
So, Tim. Listen.

595
00:33:53.526 --> 00:33:58.296
Second of all, we want accurate numbers. That's all we need, okay?

596
00:33:58.296 --> 00:33:59.395
Bye.

597
00:34:07.546 --> 00:34:08.846
Ji Won.

598
00:34:10.046 --> 00:34:12.276
You have an appointment with Chairman Li Ka-shing of National.

599
00:34:13.915 --> 00:34:16.145
It's at 2pm. Let's go. I'll take you there.

600
00:34:16.245 --> 00:34:17.616
Okay.

601
00:34:23.086 --> 00:34:26.595
By the way, for the meeting with President Sung of chemical section,

602
00:34:26.696 --> 00:34:28.796
he suggested you have dinner with some drinks.

603
00:34:29.526 --> 00:34:33.035
I know he's picky, and it's hard to get an appointment with him,

604
00:34:33.035 --> 00:34:35.106
which is why I agreed.

605
00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:37.165
But it's right after you arrive in Korea. Is it too much for you?

606
00:34:37.606 --> 00:34:40.336
It's all right. We should do as he wants.

607
00:34:41.006 --> 00:34:43.406
Gosh, you're going back to Korea without a chance to get a rest.

608
00:34:43.676 --> 00:34:45.745
You have different schedules every minute.

609
00:34:46.475 --> 00:34:48.386
All right. Cheer up.

610
00:34:48.946 --> 00:34:52.015
I'll come back to get you when your meeting is over.

611
00:34:52.216 --> 00:34:54.185
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

612
00:34:54.185 --> 00:34:55.756
It's Sa Jin Jin.

613
00:34:56.055 --> 00:34:58.526
Gosh, she's really pretty.

614
00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:07.935
- Hello, Sa Jin Jin. - Hello.

615
00:35:08.035 --> 00:35:09.765
Did you sleep well last night?

616
00:35:10.205 --> 00:35:12.606
I didn't sleep well last night.

617
00:35:13.676 --> 00:35:14.946
Is it because you were nervous?

618
00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:16.875
You shouldn't be nervous. If you act normally,

619
00:35:16.875 --> 00:35:19.176
we'll make sure to make a good program.

620
00:35:23.285 --> 00:35:25.116
So this is how you shoot this.

621
00:35:25.116 --> 00:35:26.616
She's so pretty.

622
00:35:27.685 --> 00:35:30.656
I visited this place for shooting several times.

623
00:35:30.656 --> 00:35:33.325
But it's the first time I came here for a variety show.

624
00:35:33.325 --> 00:35:37.665
Well, we'll wrap up here for now.

625
00:35:37.665 --> 00:35:38.836
All right.

626
00:35:40.116 --> 00:35:41.560
(Episode 2 will air shortly.)
