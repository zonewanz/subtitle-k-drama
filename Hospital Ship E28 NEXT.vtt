00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:10.175
(Episode 28)

2
00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:15.945
Do you have no intention of loving me,

3
00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.014
or are you not interested in love at all?

4
00:00:19.314 --> 00:00:20.374
Both.

5
00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:22.874
I don't care about love,

6
00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:25.714
but even if I did, you wouldn't be...

7
00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:27.775
the one I'd fall for.

8
00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:49.815
How can you be so sure?

9
00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:53.075
Tell me.

10
00:00:55.274 --> 00:00:56.715
What makes you so certain?

11
00:00:58.315 --> 00:00:59.944
Would you like me to tell you?

12
00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:04.744
It's because there is a man you love.

13
00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:11.044
You know who he is.

14
00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.444
That's why you can be that sure I'm not the one.

15
00:01:20.044 --> 00:01:21.074
Who is it?

16
00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.645
- Is it Hyun? - No.

17
00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:25.444
It's not him.

18
00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:18.444
How do you do it?

19
00:02:19.975 --> 00:02:21.014
Do what?

20
00:02:22.315 --> 00:02:24.444
Tell me your secret of positioning yourself.

21
00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:26.845
Basketball?

22
00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:28.044
No, women.

23
00:02:29.785 --> 00:02:31.644
You're a healthy man in his 30s,

24
00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:34.944
and the woman you love wants to just stay as colleagues.

25
00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:39.285
How can you be so calm without worrying?

26
00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.345
Who says I'm calm?

27
00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:47.745
Oh, so you're saying...

28
00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:51.614
you're holding out because there isn't anything you can do?

29
00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:53.815
I'm not holding out.

30
00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:59.074
I'm just letting things go the way they go.

31
00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:02.944
At least,

32
00:03:05.144 --> 00:03:08.044
she doesn't feel uncomfortable to be around me.

33
00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:11.215
What if nothing changes forever?

34
00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:14.044
That'd be good too.

35
00:03:15.444 --> 00:03:18.375
If she's not the one, there will be a different path.

36
00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:23.245
If you let things flow,

37
00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:26.144
time will teach you everything.

38
00:03:29.444 --> 00:03:30.514
You sound like an old man.

39
00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:35.775
Don't sweat it.

40
00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:38.914
Time will solve all matters.

41
00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:43.215
When grown-ups said this to me in the past,

42
00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:45.074
I just found it ridiculous.

43
00:03:47.014 --> 00:03:48.144
But now,

44
00:03:49.674 --> 00:03:51.875
I think they were right.

45
00:03:52.644 --> 00:03:55.014
Stop pretending to be a grown-up.

46
00:03:55.014 --> 00:03:56.644
Aren't we grown-ups?

47
00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:02.345
You and I, we're both in our 30s.

48
00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:09.775
Let's go. The others will be waiting.

49
00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:10.944
Okay.

50
00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:16.575
Don't you think we get along too well?

51
00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:20.445
Aren't we kind of love rivals?

52
00:04:22.544 --> 00:04:23.945
That only stands...

53
00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:27.515
if Doctor Song considers us real guys.

54
00:04:28.914 --> 00:04:32.215
What am I if not a real guy?

55
00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:35.174
Ask Doctor Song.

56
00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:37.075
What?

57
00:04:37.275 --> 00:04:38.575
News summary.

58
00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:41.775
Police arrested a gang trying to smuggle...

59
00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:44.145
methamphetamine into Korea.

60
00:04:44.515 --> 00:04:46.544
They were found with firearms...

61
00:04:46.544 --> 00:04:48.374
which was an added shock.

62
00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:50.314
The next story.

63
00:04:50.575 --> 00:04:53.414
Shortly after a minor was assaulted in Busan,

64
00:04:53.414 --> 00:04:55.314
- in Cheonan... - What are you doing?

65
00:04:55.314 --> 00:04:57.314
The GPS is acting up.

66
00:04:57.314 --> 00:04:59.114
It's such a nuisance.

67
00:04:59.114 --> 00:05:00.975
- For assaulting a friend... - This GPS.

68
00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:03.414
Two girls aged 14, one surnamed Seo...

69
00:05:03.414 --> 00:05:05.215
were arrested and charged.

70
00:05:05.215 --> 00:05:09.374
What do you think the world is coming to?

71
00:05:09.374 --> 00:05:12.544
They're kids themselves. How could they hurt a friend?

72
00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:15.775
A lot of them copy what they see adults do.

73
00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:18.645
That's true. Oh, by the way.

74
00:05:19.215 --> 00:05:22.275
We've been sleeping and eating on board for two days.

75
00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:24.414
Do they seem to be managing okay?

76
00:05:24.414 --> 00:05:26.174
They're all settled in now.

77
00:05:26.874 --> 00:05:28.515
What about the dentist?

78
00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:30.775
How is his seasickness these days?

79
00:05:30.775 --> 00:05:33.544
How could that ever go away?

80
00:05:33.544 --> 00:05:35.945
He just has to learn how to deal with it.

81
00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:37.515
Oh, right.

82
00:05:38.044 --> 00:05:41.845
Is the team dinner tonight still on?

83
00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:45.345
We're busy putting everything together.

84
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.945
You'd better. A team dinner's long overdue.

85
00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:54.275
What's that? Are you playing games again?

86
00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:56.874
Yes. Don't talk to me, I might die.

87
00:05:57.744 --> 00:05:59.374
I need to play as well.

88
00:06:00.645 --> 00:06:03.414
At 4am this morning, near Jangseungpo Port,

89
00:06:03.414 --> 00:06:05.845
Police arrested a gang trying to smuggle...

90
00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:08.174
methamphetamine into Korea.

91
00:06:08.445 --> 00:06:11.515
The street value of the meth seized was 31 million dollars.

92
00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:13.044
The gang was planning to...

93
00:06:13.044 --> 00:06:15.044
sell them off to Japan.

94
00:06:15.044 --> 00:06:18.244
- Give me that. - They were found with firearms...

95
00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:20.244
which was an added shock.

96
00:06:20.244 --> 00:06:23.145
Lee, the leader of the gang...

97
00:06:23.145 --> 00:06:25.374
and five other members are still at large.

98
00:06:25.374 --> 00:06:27.914
Police are focusing efforts to track them down.

99
00:06:27.914 --> 00:06:30.145
- It's really hot. - Make some room.

100
00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:31.645
Tonight around 9pm...

101
00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:35.645
Something smells delicious.

102
00:06:36.614 --> 00:06:37.945
Are you on dinner duty?

103
00:06:37.945 --> 00:06:38.975
- Yes. - Yes.

104
00:06:38.975 --> 00:06:41.814
- Is this your treat, Doctor Song? - Yes.

105
00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:44.174
Why did you spend so much?

106
00:06:44.174 --> 00:06:46.374
Did you sell half your house or something?

107
00:06:46.374 --> 00:06:47.544
Just half?

108
00:06:48.244 --> 00:06:50.575
A cake. I forgot to get a cake.

109
00:06:50.575 --> 00:06:52.475
A cake? What for?

110
00:06:52.475 --> 00:06:54.244
It's Mr. Yang's birthday today.

111
00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:57.674
- Is it really? - I'm so embarrassed now.

112
00:06:57.674 --> 00:06:59.814
He has to make a wish then.

113
00:07:00.345 --> 00:07:03.414
Shall we go to the supermarket by the dock?

114
00:07:03.414 --> 00:07:06.674
- To get something to make a cake. - Shall we?

115
00:07:06.674 --> 00:07:09.475
No. You don't have to go.

116
00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:18.715
Did you know about it beforehand?

117
00:07:18.715 --> 00:07:21.374
That it's his birthday?

118
00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:22.814
How?

119
00:07:22.914 --> 00:07:26.544
I just happened to find out.

120
00:07:26.544 --> 00:07:27.945
You happened to?

121
00:07:31.645 --> 00:07:35.715
- Something's fishy. - Don't say that.

122
00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:40.015
Nothing's going on.

123
00:07:43.215 --> 00:07:46.515
For the doctors and nurses of the hospital ship...

124
00:07:46.515 --> 00:07:50.215
who care for patients day and night...

125
00:07:50.215 --> 00:07:53.614
Before we begin, let me show you what I brought.

126
00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:56.345
- Again? - I like that.

127
00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:58.445
Take one each.

128
00:08:01.975 --> 00:08:04.374
- Did you all take a packet? - Yes, yes.

129
00:08:04.374 --> 00:08:06.744
Doctor Song, stand up, please.

130
00:08:08.674 --> 00:08:12.244
Today, she spent her hard-earned cash...

131
00:08:12.244 --> 00:08:15.374
to buy meat to nourish the flesh and bone of the staff...

132
00:08:15.374 --> 00:08:16.945
and crew of the hospital ship.

133
00:08:16.945 --> 00:08:19.314
Our dear Doctor Song deserves...

134
00:08:19.314 --> 00:08:21.744
our love and a toast.

135
00:08:21.744 --> 00:08:23.374
- Cheers. - Cheers.

136
00:08:23.374 --> 00:08:25.674
Down your first drink on an empty stomach.

137
00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:29.145
Thank you, Doctor Song.

138
00:08:29.145 --> 00:08:31.544
- Thank you. - Thank you.

139
00:09:13.274 --> 00:09:15.415
- Okay. - Let's go.

140
00:09:30.345 --> 00:09:31.345
- Go! - Let's go!

141
00:09:43.014 --> 00:09:44.874
Just die!

142
00:10:14.144 --> 00:10:16.644
Happy birthday, Choon Ho.

143
00:10:19.575 --> 00:10:20.874
Thank you.

144
00:10:20.874 --> 00:10:22.514
You make a nice couple.

145
00:10:22.514 --> 00:10:24.445
Maybe it's the cake.

146
00:10:24.445 --> 00:10:27.244
- What? - I was kidding.

147
00:10:27.774 --> 00:10:31.114
Smudge some cream on Choon Ho's face.

148
00:10:31.114 --> 00:10:33.175
You two should just...

149
00:10:34.415 --> 00:10:36.075
She really did it.

150
00:10:36.075 --> 00:10:38.514
She actually did as she was told.

151
00:10:38.915 --> 00:10:41.075
Get the lights. Lights!

152
00:10:50.774 --> 00:10:52.075
Our boss.

153
00:10:52.274 --> 00:10:55.014
- Where's our boss? - Boss.

154
00:10:55.575 --> 00:10:56.675
- Boss! - Boss!

155
00:11:11.445 --> 00:11:14.675
What now? Shouldn't we take him to a hospital?

156
00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.445
Were you shot in the head?

157
00:11:17.215 --> 00:11:18.244
Do you think...

158
00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:21.415
the doctors will welcome us if we go looking like this?

159
00:11:21.644 --> 00:11:25.244
They'd call the police before doing anything to help him.

160
00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:28.815
Then what? Will we leave him to die?

161
00:11:31.144 --> 00:11:32.614
We can't do that.

162
00:11:33.014 --> 00:11:35.144
He knows something worth a fortune.

163
00:11:36.575 --> 00:11:40.014
- What should we do? - Shut your mouth for a bit.

164
00:11:40.774 --> 00:11:42.175
Let me think.

165
00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:47.614
- Boss. - Didn't you hear me? Shut it.

166
00:11:48.144 --> 00:11:49.614
I have an idea.

167
00:11:49.614 --> 00:11:51.244
If it's not a good one,

168
00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:53.915
I will shoot you in the head myself.

169
00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:56.545
Look.

170
00:12:00.114 --> 00:12:03.514
- A hospital ship? - Yes, a hospital ship.

171
00:12:03.845 --> 00:12:05.744
There's a serious doctor...

172
00:12:05.744 --> 00:12:07.644
who takes out appendices...

173
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.644
and sews on severed hands.

174
00:12:10.845 --> 00:12:12.215
Who's that?

175
00:12:18.345 --> 00:12:20.075
(Surgeon Song Eun Jae)

176
00:12:20.075 --> 00:12:21.575
Song Eun Jae?

177
00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:24.845
This pretty girl is a monster surgeon?

178
00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:27.545
Yes, according to the news articles.

179
00:12:27.545 --> 00:12:29.445
- Not only that... - There's more?

180
00:12:29.445 --> 00:12:32.514
Her ship is docked very near by.

181
00:12:38.774 --> 00:12:41.715
I really stuffed myself for once in a long while.

182
00:12:41.715 --> 00:12:43.915
- That was good. - Wasn't it?

183
00:12:43.915 --> 00:12:45.715
Did you drink a lot, Nurse Yoo?

184
00:12:45.715 --> 00:12:48.114
You agree with what I say?

185
00:12:48.114 --> 00:12:50.215
What's there not to agree with?

186
00:12:50.715 --> 00:12:52.274
We wrapped up early.

187
00:12:53.114 --> 00:12:56.345
We're on duty tomorrow. Then I have to be at the ER.

188
00:12:57.045 --> 00:13:00.274
- Aren't you going downstairs? - I have some work to do.

189
00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:13.744
Why won't you tell him Ms. Choi isn't sick?

190
00:13:13.915 --> 00:13:16.945
You should if he's your friend. Why?

191
00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:20.114
You wouldn't want a friend to be duped.

192
00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:23.675
Or end up ruining his life because of a witch.

193
00:13:24.445 --> 00:13:25.845
But still, you have...

194
00:13:28.075 --> 00:13:29.715
no intention of telling him.

195
00:13:29.715 --> 00:13:31.244
- That's... - Because...

196
00:13:32.075 --> 00:13:34.144
you don't want him to feel ashamed?

197
00:13:36.874 --> 00:13:38.045
No.

198
00:13:38.675 --> 00:13:41.815
You don't want to look like a jealous woman.

199
00:13:42.445 --> 00:13:44.315
You don't want the man you like...

200
00:13:45.445 --> 00:13:47.614
to think less of you.

201
00:13:51.545 --> 00:13:52.675
No.

202
00:13:53.644 --> 00:13:55.144
It's not that.

203
00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.644
Sewoon Hospital?

204
00:14:02.014 --> 00:14:03.244
Put me through to Choi Young Eun...

205
00:14:03.244 --> 00:14:05.415
who's in the Hemato-oncology Department.

206
00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:09.144
What's the patient's name again?

207
00:14:09.144 --> 00:14:10.445
Choi Young Eun.

208
00:14:10.874 --> 00:14:13.374
She's Chief Choi Hyun Shik's niece.

209
00:14:14.845 --> 00:14:16.675
I'm sorry, but...

210
00:14:16.675 --> 00:14:19.614
we don't have a record of a patient with that name.

211
00:14:19.744 --> 00:14:21.374
She wasn't admitted?

212
00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:32.114
(Hyun)

213
00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:36.945
Why won't you take it?

214
00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:40.244
How can I when I sound drunk?

215
00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:42.975
What will you tell him later?

216
00:14:45.744 --> 00:14:48.114
I'll say that I was being treated.

217
00:14:53.175 --> 00:14:55.575
What an incredible hospital suite this is.

218
00:15:06.475 --> 00:15:08.014
What are you doing?

219
00:15:08.614 --> 00:15:12.614
What are you doing with my son?

221
00:16:38.975 --> 00:16:41.915
Did one of the ropes come undone?

222
00:17:00.014 --> 00:17:01.374
The duty journal.

223
00:17:02.045 --> 00:17:03.644
Who are you?

224
00:17:07.645 --> 00:17:09.314
The duty journal.

225
00:17:10.244 --> 00:17:12.814
Do you know what that is?

226
00:17:18.445 --> 00:17:19.645
Answer me.

227
00:17:25.514 --> 00:17:27.774
It's over there.

228
00:17:30.774 --> 00:17:31.945
This?

229
00:17:47.715 --> 00:17:50.744
- The cake was delicious. - Was it really?

230
00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:29.715
Captain Bang Sung Woo and 17 other staff.

231
00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:33.344
That means there's a total of 18 people on board.

232
00:18:43.574 --> 00:18:45.314
You sneaky jerk.

233
00:18:45.945 --> 00:18:47.014
What?

234
00:18:47.915 --> 00:18:50.875
Were you going to signal for help?

235
00:18:56.244 --> 00:18:58.074
I'm in control of the wheelhouse.

236
00:18:58.615 --> 00:19:01.274
- Move in. - Yes, boss.

237
00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:03.074
Yes, boss.

238
00:19:24.574 --> 00:19:25.715
Tie him up.

239
00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:27.715
I said tie him up.

240
00:19:46.014 --> 00:19:48.175
Tie him up. Hurry.

241
00:20:27.274 --> 00:20:28.574
You jerk.

242
00:20:31.574 --> 00:20:32.675
Hands up!

Keep quiet!

245
00:20:49.675 --> 00:20:51.945
Walk. Get in there, now!

246
00:20:52.014 --> 00:20:54.675
- Hurry up. - Let's move it.

247
00:20:54.675 --> 00:20:55.945
Move!

248
00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.115
Move it!

Song Eun Jae.

250

Who's Song Eun Jae?

251
00:21:29.774 --> 00:21:31.074
This is her.

252
00:21:42.915 --> 00:21:44.574
Nurse Pyo.

253
00:21:45.145 --> 00:21:47.574
Nurse Pyo. Are you okay?

254
00:21:48.945 --> 00:21:50.445
Doctor Song.

255
00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:59.115
You're prettier in the flesh.

256
00:22:03.915 --> 00:22:06.314
Are you that great a surgeon?

257
00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:09.514
I need you to operate on someone.

258
00:22:10.574 --> 00:22:12.445
- Take her. - Yes, boss.

259
00:22:12.744 --> 00:22:14.044
Take her.

260
00:22:14.844 --> 00:22:16.415
- Doctor! - No!

261
00:22:16.415 --> 00:22:17.514
Wait.

262
00:22:30.145 --> 00:22:32.645
- Didn't you hear something? - Hear what?

(Coast Guard)

264
00:22:34.675 --> 00:22:36.744
I think it came from the hospital ship.

265
00:22:41.044 --> 00:22:43.215
Hey, hey.

266
00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:46.814
Who are you?

267
00:22:50.875 --> 00:22:52.244
You said you have someone...

268
00:22:52.915 --> 00:22:55.615
- who needs emergency surgery. - So what?

269
00:22:55.615 --> 00:22:58.945
Even the simplest of surgeries can't be done alone.

270
00:23:00.244 --> 00:23:02.645
- And? - I'll come too.

271
00:23:05.774 --> 00:23:08.574
Who are you? Are you a doctor?

272
00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:12.675
- Check. - Yes, boss.

274
00:23:22.314 --> 00:23:24.814
He's a doctor. Internal Medicine, Kwak Hyun.

275
00:23:28.014 --> 00:23:29.314
Bring him too.

276

Come along.

277
00:23:32.645 --> 00:23:35.814
- No, Doctor Song! - Doctor Song.

278
00:23:35.875 --> 00:23:37.074
Doctor Song!

279
00:23:38.115 --> 00:23:39.145
Doctor Song.

281
00:23:47.215 --> 00:23:48.314
What?

282
00:23:52.244 --> 00:23:54.615
Hospital ship, please respond.

283
00:23:55.074 --> 00:23:56.244
Hospital ship, respond.

284

This is Coast Guard.

285
00:23:58.544 --> 00:24:00.844
Hospital ship, please respond.

286
00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:02.244
Answer it.

287
00:24:02.945 --> 00:24:06.044
If you want to save people on the hospital ship,

288
00:24:07.044 --> 00:24:08.115
answer it.

289
00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:10.344
Now.

290
00:24:13.074 --> 00:24:15.145
Captain, what is this sound?

291
00:24:15.145 --> 00:24:16.445
Is there a problem?

292
00:24:18.274 --> 00:24:19.274
Captain.

293
00:24:19.715 --> 00:24:20.774
Captain?

294
00:24:21.615 --> 00:24:22.744
It's me.

295
00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:26.514
No, there's no problem.

296
00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:31.645
There must be a problem with the distribution panel.

297
00:24:32.744 --> 00:24:33.814
Hurry.

298
00:24:44.744 --> 00:24:45.744
Hurry up.

299
00:24:48.344 --> 00:24:49.774
Why did you do it? It wasn't necessary.

300
00:24:50.314 --> 00:24:51.675
I couldn't let you go alone.

301
00:24:56.645 --> 00:24:57.675
Come out.

302
00:24:58.044 --> 00:24:59.044
Come out now.

303
00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:11.514
(Coast Guard does its best.)

304
00:25:19.544 --> 00:25:21.915
Captain, why is there an undocking ship?

305
00:25:22.145 --> 00:25:23.645
Do you have an emergency patient?

306
00:25:25.675 --> 00:25:27.244
Yes.

307
00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:29.744
We have an emergency patient.

308
00:25:30.074 --> 00:25:31.615
I see. Thank you.

309
00:25:32.074 --> 00:25:34.074
Thank you.

310
00:25:35.044 --> 00:25:37.215
That's good. Put it down.
