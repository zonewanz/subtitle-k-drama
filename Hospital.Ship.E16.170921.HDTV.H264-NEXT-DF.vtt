<i>[Episode 16]</i>

3
00:00:25.887 --> 00:00:27.626
<i>Why isn't she coming back up?</i>

4
00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:37.207
<i>What are you going to do? Are you
going to pull her out by her hair?</i>

5
00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:39.865
<i>Of course. Who does she think she is?</i>

6
00:00:41.694 --> 00:00:44.103
<i>Should I check just once?</i>

7
00:00:45.014 --> 00:00:48.631
<i>Won't Doctor Kwak be sad
if I have suspicions?</i>

8
00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:53.408
<i>Yeah, you should check it out.
It doesn't matter who it's for.</i>

9
00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:18.364
<i>Where are you going?</i>

10
00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:23.254
<i>Who do you think you are
to sleep with Doctor Kwak?</i>

11
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:50.423
Song Eun Jae, what are you doing?

12
00:01:56.028 --> 00:02:00.501
I won't waste my life
with useless games of emotion.

13
00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:32.129
<i>Mind your own business.
Don't look at them.</i>

14
00:02:37.317 --> 00:02:40.645
- Good morning.
- It is.

15
00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:44.450
Is it the fresh air?
I slept really well last night.

16
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:46.280
That's good.

17
00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:01.431
Geez, that was a good sleep.

18
00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:07.425
- Hyun.
- Hey, come here.

19
00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:09.628
What is it? Are you going to
shower together?

20
00:03:09.628 --> 00:03:11.295
Let go of me.

21
00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:16.038
And why don't you go to a hotel

22
00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:18.753
or worry about your dress code?

23
00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:22.307
I... don't mind seeing this.

24
00:03:22.307 --> 00:03:24.748
But this is a shared house.

25
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.282
What are you doing?

26
00:03:58.282 --> 00:04:00.945
What's the matter?
I came because I missed you.

27
00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:02.700
- Leave.
- I don't want to.

28
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.126
- Be quiet. You'll wake people up.
- You started it.

29
00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:09.933
Let's sleep. Lie down. Let's sleep.

30
00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:11.525
I have no choice then.

31
00:04:56.283 --> 00:04:57.908
Here you are.

32
00:04:57.908 --> 00:04:59.682
I looked for you
because I wanted to talk.

33
00:04:59.682 --> 00:05:02.024
But you left early. Did you go for a run?

34
00:05:08.923 --> 00:05:10.225
Are you okay?

35
00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:21.884
Doctor.

36
00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:25.624
Doctor Song.

37
00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.199
It looks like she seriously
misunderstood.

38
00:05:36.684 --> 00:05:38.315
It seems that way.

39
00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:40.709
It's a good thing.

40
00:05:41.286 --> 00:05:44.726
At least you know she's bothered by it.

41
00:06:05.435 --> 00:06:06.923
Hello?

42
00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:11.327
Who is this?

43
00:06:40.588 --> 00:06:44.596
<i>Let's meet this evening.
I need to talk to you.</i>

44
00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:57.017
<i>[Doctor Song Eun Jae]</i>

45
00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.399
Yes, Section Chief. This is Song Eun Jae.

46
00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:13.223
I want to change my ER schedule.

47
00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:16.711
Yes. It's not that.

48
00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:19.012
I'll take all the shifts
until the weekend.

49
00:07:19.012 --> 00:07:22.312
<i>Will you be okay? Isn't that too much?</i>

50
00:07:24.122 --> 00:07:25.596
Please do that for me.

51
00:07:27.403 --> 00:07:29.783
- What is it?
- I have something to say.

52
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.389
- Is it work-related?
- No.

53
00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:33.413
- Then don't say it.
- About yesterday...

54
00:07:33.413 --> 00:07:35.858
- That's enough.
- Don't misunderstand. Nothing...

55
00:07:35.858 --> 00:07:37.408
I told you not to say it.

56
00:07:37.408 --> 00:07:41.829
Regardless of your relationship, or what
you did, it has nothing to do with me.

57
00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:44.988
I don't have enough free time
to worry about those things.

58
00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:19.057
Yes, I don't know.

59
00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.692
I really don't know.

60
00:08:25.692 --> 00:08:30.144
Father... didn't even show up
at Mom's funeral.

61
00:09:20.007 --> 00:09:22.386
How have you been?

62
00:09:22.386 --> 00:09:24.294
Let me take a look.

63
00:09:28.994 --> 00:09:30.646
Hello!

64
00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:33.335
It's this house.

65
00:09:37.674 --> 00:09:41.757
Please hang in there. I'll do it
so it doesn't hurt. Good job.

66
00:09:41.757 --> 00:09:44.256
Doctor, pass me the bandage.

67
00:09:45.713 --> 00:09:48.810
Doctor. Bandage.

68
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.276
Yes.

69
00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.494
Doctor.

70
00:10:21.962 --> 00:10:23.638
Hello.

71
00:10:56.387 --> 00:10:59.597
Doctor, we still have a lot to do today.

72
00:11:00.127 --> 00:11:03.637
- Give me your gloves.
- Let's go.

73
00:11:09.688 --> 00:11:13.020
- Does your head hurt?
- Yes, a little bit.

74
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.780
Don't you feel out of breath
and have tightness in your chest?

75
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:19.599
You don't have an appetite
either, do you?

76
00:11:19.599 --> 00:11:22.742
I noticed you haven't been eating much.

77
00:11:22.742 --> 00:11:25.319
- I'll get better.
- You won't.

78
00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:27.641
It'll get worse.

79
00:11:28.435 --> 00:11:31.761
These are all symptoms
of falling in love...

80
00:11:31.761 --> 00:11:33.628
Excuse me...

81
00:11:33.628 --> 00:11:36.143
It's not your first time, is it?

82
00:11:39.104 --> 00:11:40.661
Is it your first time?

83
00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:45.318
It is! Is that why
you're just avoiding it?

84
00:11:45.318 --> 00:11:48.584
Don't avoid it, face it head on!
Love is a good thing!

85
00:11:48.584 --> 00:11:51.108
Love is everything! Don't you know that?

86
00:11:52.473 --> 00:11:57.824
And, I'm not sure if you've heard,
but nothing happened with Artist Choi!

87
00:11:57.824 --> 00:12:02.151
I heard Doctor Kwak slept in
the doctor of oriental medicine's room!

88
00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:25.079
- Doctor Song Eun Jae.
- Who are you?

89
00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:28.391
That's right. I've seen you on TV

90
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:30.617
but I guess you wouldn't know me.

91
00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:33.071
I'm Jae Geol's mother.

92
00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:35.917
- I see. Hello.
- Hello.

93
00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:38.287
- Please speak comfortably.
- Yes.

94
00:12:39.988 --> 00:12:43.070
- Then...
- I'm Director Kim's wife.

95
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.699
It's nice to meet you.

96
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:50.883
Are you sick?

97
00:12:51.922 --> 00:12:56.553
It's a chronic illness.
I don't have a very healthy stomach.

98
00:12:56.553 --> 00:13:00.411
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.
Let's shake hands.

99
00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:01.763
Yes.

100
00:13:11.031 --> 00:13:12.588
Please wait inside.

101
00:13:13.489 --> 00:13:15.018
Thank you.

102
00:13:19.373 --> 00:13:21.594
She can't digest very well?

103
00:13:27.987 --> 00:13:30.723
<i>[Surgical Ward]</i>

104
00:13:32.713 --> 00:13:34.154
- You scared me.
- Oh my.

105
00:13:34.954 --> 00:13:36.897
What brings you here?

106
00:13:36.897 --> 00:13:41.018
Invite me to sit down.
Like father like son.

107
00:13:41.018 --> 00:13:44.065
You're both so cold.

108
00:13:44.065 --> 00:13:45.853
It's because of the villa, isn't it?

109
00:13:48.743 --> 00:13:53.450
Yeah. I got a call from Mr. Hong.

110
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.994
Why are you messing with the villa?

111
00:13:54.994 --> 00:13:58.044
Why did you get rid
of the perfectly fine door sills?

112
00:13:58.044 --> 00:14:01.289
- Why is it under construction?
- Because I need it.

113
00:14:01.289 --> 00:14:04.698
What for? Are you going to live there?

114
00:14:04.698 --> 00:14:08.385
Yes. With Grandpa.

115
00:14:08.385 --> 00:14:09.875
What?

116
00:14:19.415 --> 00:14:22.125
<i>Grandpa has palsy and lives by himself.</i>

117
00:14:23.345 --> 00:14:27.123
If I think about what he did
for us all this time

118
00:14:27.123 --> 00:14:29.494
this is the least we can do.

119
00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:32.430
Is this the time
to worry about other people?

120
00:14:35.386 --> 00:14:37.631
Gosh, my life...

121
00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:50.887

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

122
00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:02.095
Yes.

123
00:15:08.882 --> 00:15:11.415
Give me some water
and digestive medicine.

124
00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:15.405
- Why do you need digestive medicine?
- My chest feels tight.

125
00:15:15.405 --> 00:15:17.648
So give me some digestive medicine.

126
00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:24.909
She doesn't need digestive medicine.

127
00:15:24.909 --> 00:15:27.973
It's not because of indigestion.
Ma'am, please lie down.

128
00:15:27.973 --> 00:15:30.286
"Ma'am?"

129
00:15:30.286 --> 00:15:32.233
We don't have time. Hurry.

130
00:15:37.246 --> 00:15:39.179
Please take a deep breath.

131
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.402
Please lie on your left side.

132
00:15:49.587 --> 00:15:51.541
Hold your breath.

133
00:15:53.537 --> 00:15:56.747
I know it's hard, but one more time.

134
00:16:00.429 --> 00:16:02.810
What are you doing?

135
00:16:24.378 --> 00:16:26.314
- Call for a helicopter.
- What?

136
00:16:26.314 --> 00:16:29.901
- I think it's a heart attack...
- A heart attack?

137
00:16:30.585 --> 00:16:33.882
- This makes no sense.
- Doctor Song.

138
00:16:33.882 --> 00:16:35.834
Call the coast guard
and ask for a helicopter!

139
00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:38.742
You diagnosed her with a heart attack
with a stethoscope?

140
00:16:38.742 --> 00:16:43.327
You can't diagnose a heart attack
with a stethoscope. Let's get an EKG.

141
00:16:43.327 --> 00:16:44.919
I heard it.

142
00:16:48.275 --> 00:16:50.671
I've definitely heard this sound before.

143
00:16:59.079 --> 00:17:01.061
- Bring the nitroglycerin!
- Yes!

144
00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:02.184
Yes!

145
00:17:11.896 --> 00:17:14.338
- Follow me with the monitor.
- Yes.

146
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.437
- Did you really hear this sound?
- Yes.

147
00:17:28.437 --> 00:17:30.392
Jae Geol, let's call the coast guard.

148
00:17:30.392 --> 00:17:32.402
We have to if she heard
anything like this sound.

149
00:17:32.402 --> 00:17:34.637
I don't know what you're talking about.

150
00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:36.982
We don't have time, so just listen.

151
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.008
I'll call them.

152
00:17:39.008 --> 00:17:42.469
You might feel like you are suffocating,
so I'll undo your buttons for you.

153
00:17:44.047 --> 00:17:47.179
- Are you certain?
- Wait outside.

154
00:17:48.496 --> 00:17:50.289
What are you doing...

155
00:17:50.289 --> 00:17:54.899
We will monitor you until the helicopter
arrives. You don't have to worry.

156
00:17:55.956 --> 00:17:57.272
Here.

157
00:17:57.924 --> 00:17:59.923
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

158
00:17:59.923 --> 00:18:02.697
There's no way. I'll look at her myself.

159
00:18:02.697 --> 00:18:04.517
Jae Geol, what is it?

160
00:18:04.517 --> 00:18:07.774
Doctor, her oxygen level
is decreasing.

161
00:18:07.774 --> 00:18:09.759
Mom! Mom...

162
00:18:12.436 --> 00:18:15.875
- She's not breathing.
- Mom, wake up! Mom! Mom!

163
00:18:15.875 --> 00:18:18.125
- Get him out of here!
- Mom!

164
00:18:18.868 --> 00:18:20.793
Let go of me! Mom!

165
00:18:20.793 --> 00:18:22.492
Let's intubate her!

166
00:19:08.108 --> 00:19:09.983
<i>This is my mom!</i>

167
00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:13.121
This is my mom...

168
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.057
Charge!

169
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.138
Charge!

170
00:20:00.396 --> 00:20:03.123
I heard you diagnosed her
heart attack with a stethoscope.

171
00:20:03.123 --> 00:20:04.723
Good work, Doctor Song Eun Jae.

172
00:20:04.723 --> 00:20:06.860
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

173
00:20:38.387 --> 00:20:39.988
Hyun.

174
00:20:39.988 --> 00:20:41.884
Everyone left, so why don't we also...

175
00:20:41.884 --> 00:20:43.529
Artist Choi, please stop.

176
00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:48.213
Can you... leave me alone?

177
00:20:50.281 --> 00:20:54.025
What's wrong with you today?
Why are you...

178
00:21:51.639 --> 00:21:53.656
Where's your mother?

179
00:21:53.656 --> 00:21:55.117
She's inside.

180
00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:08.819
You...

181
00:22:08.819 --> 00:22:12.692
- Did you provoke your mother again?
- Yes, a little bit.

182
00:22:12.692 --> 00:22:15.131
You damned bastard.

183
00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:19.669
So why did you go
to oriental medical school?

184
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:21.505
Did you want to rub salt into my wound?

185
00:22:21.505 --> 00:22:24.307
If you do that, your mother's heart
explodes too, you punk!

186
00:22:24.307 --> 00:22:26.213
- Father!
- What?

187
00:22:26.213 --> 00:22:29.889
Doctors of oriental medicine are doctors
too? Fine, then what did you do for her?

188
00:22:29.889 --> 00:22:32.383
What did you do for your mother?

189
00:22:32.383 --> 00:22:34.608
You did nothing.
Are you going to keep insisting

190
00:22:34.608 --> 00:22:36.835
that doctors
of oriental medicine are doctors?

191
00:22:38.014 --> 00:22:39.867
He's her guardian.

192
00:22:41.168 --> 00:22:43.610
The reason why Doctor Kim Jae Geol
couldn't do anything

193
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.884
wasn't because he's a doctor of oriental
medicine, but because he's her guardian.

194
00:22:46.884 --> 00:22:50.537
- Doctor Song Eun Jae...
- Isn't it the same for us too?

195
00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:54.416
Even if we save dozens of lives
every day, it's hard to be doctors

196
00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:56.631
when it comes to family.

197
00:22:56.631 --> 00:23:00.706
We lose our objectivity...
or become absentminded.

198
00:23:01.278 --> 00:23:03.514
The surgery went well.

199
00:23:03.514 --> 00:23:07.671
She's in the recovery room, so she'll
be transferred to a hospital room soon.

200
00:24:46.422 --> 00:24:48.019
When did it start?

201
00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:55.809
After your mother passed away...

202
00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.039
did you listen to this every day?

203
00:25:10.812 --> 00:25:12.416
If...

204
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:17.351
I had examined
your mother more closely...

205
00:25:18.184 --> 00:25:19.779
I wonder what would have happened.

206
00:25:23.179 --> 00:25:25.823
If I had given her
a closer examination...

207
00:25:25.823 --> 00:25:27.768
and checked her condition.

208
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:37.394
Didn't you... resent me?

209
00:25:40.462 --> 00:25:42.972
I didn't have time to do that.

210
00:25:44.716 --> 00:25:46.992
I was too busy resenting myself.

211
00:25:55.405 --> 00:25:56.905
I'm sorry.

212
00:26:48.412 --> 00:26:50.511
I heard.

213
00:26:51.765 --> 00:26:54.019
I heard that I'm alive...

214
00:26:55.373 --> 00:27:00.181
because... of your mother.

215
00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:13.733
From now on...

216
00:27:14.457 --> 00:27:16.366
I'll be your mother.

217
00:27:17.918 --> 00:27:20.356
Think of me as your mother.

218
00:27:22.906 --> 00:27:24.731
Thank you.

219
00:27:26.701 --> 00:27:31.211
Thank you... for staying alive.

220
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.249
Geez.

221
00:28:30.101 --> 00:28:32.156
She's pretty when she cries.

222
00:28:57.876 --> 00:29:00.729
Are you back to work now?
How's your mother?

223
00:29:00.729 --> 00:29:02.850
How much do you like Song Eun Jae?

224
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.415
If you like her, take good care of her.

225
00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:08.458
I might want to steal her away.

226
00:29:16.303 --> 00:29:21.303
