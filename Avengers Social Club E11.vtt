Episode 11

3
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.720
Oppa is the one who wanted
to go overseas to study?

4
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.720
Seo Yeon, go inside.

5
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.100
Since he had failed science,
dad was ashamed of him.

6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.740
So, you told him that he might
as well go overseas to study.

7
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.520
Oppa said so much that
he didn't want to!

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.820
That he was afraid!
But, you forced him to go!

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.720
Yah, Baek Seo Yeon!

10
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.960
What do you think you know that you rudely
talk back to your father like this?!

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.480
Why?

12
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.460
Are you going to hit me, too?!

13
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.820
I wish I were dead as well!

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.660
You brat!

15
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.660
How dare you raise your hand to her?

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.120
You...

17
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.900
You...

18
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.480
are finished!

19
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440
Pack your things, Seo Yeon.

20
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.840
Ay!

21
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.240
What are you doing?!

22
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The reason that I
endured you until now...

23
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.740
that since you were the
father of our children...

24
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.380
that even if it's a small thing, at least
you didn't raise a hand to Seo Yeon.

25
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.080
You saw her also. That girl,
she said wanted to die as well!

26
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.560
How must Seo Yeon have felt!

27
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.400
Because of protecting your reputation, we
couldn't even send Seo Jin off properly.

28
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.400
And now, using even a dead child,
can you call yourself a dad?

29
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.140
How many times do I have to say this?!
I'm not doing this just for my own good!

30
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.980
For you and for Seo Yeon,
for our family...!

31
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.820
You...

32
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.020
not even one time,
have you ever done something for us.

33
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.780
Where are you going?

34
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.880
Stop right there!

35
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.660
I've returned.

36
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.200
You're late today.

37
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.240
I was playing over at
Hee Soo's before I came.

38
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.660
That person.

39
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.380
She happily accepted it, didn't she?

40
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.360
It's good that it happened anyway.

41
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.620
After she does the interview,
she's going to leave immediately.

42
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.520
Now I really will be able
to live without seeing her.

43
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.940
Before she leaves, perhaps just once...

44
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.220
I'm sick and tired of it.

45
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.660
Madam hasn't changed your mind either,
have you?

46
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.960
After that person's interview goes out,

47
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.740
not even Geon Ah will
be able to stop it.

48
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.360
Yes.

49
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.140
If that happens,

50
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.820
then not even Grandfather will
be able to hold onto Madam.

51
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.680
I don't want to.

52
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.620
I will not eat them.

53
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.040
Then, I guess I'll have to eat them all.

54
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.820
I will eat them.

55
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.980
Thank you.

56
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.700
Child.

57
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.900
You are pretty.

58
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.520
You are nice.

59
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.440
My pretty baby.

60
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.540
Grandmother.

61
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.540
Even to Seo Yeon?!

62
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.280
Yah...

63
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.220
That person.
It's really the end for him.

64
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.020
The end!
There is just no way to improve him.

65
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.660
Son of a...! Just kill him!

66
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.080
Oh!

67
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.600
That's why... I hit him.

68
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.700
Y-y...

69
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.040
You hit that person?

70
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.960
Yes.

71
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.360
What that person did to Seo Yeon,
I returned the same to him.

72
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.640
You should have returned everything that
you had received from him till now as well!

73
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.740
I said let's kill him!

74
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.280
Please calm down a little!

75
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.800
So, is Seo Yeon okay?

76
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.140
She was very shocked, but

77
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.920
she's doing fine with grandmother now.

78
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.600
I should have hit him as well.

79
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.740
You? Why?

80
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.500
Father is trying to get rid of
Madam and me from this land.

81
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.180
What?

82
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.840
But, how?

83
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.940
He says he's sending us overseas.

84
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.900
He told this child to pick a school,

85
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.380
and he told me to pick a house.

86
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.580
Ah!

87
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.680
Ah, those persons.

88
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.080
The two of them, even came by my store,
but they were both acting so stupidly...

89
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.700
So, what are you going to do?

90
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.400
I've asked everyone I can for help,
but...

91
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.060
I am still feeling troubled.

92
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.200
Mi Sook, what about you?

93
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.440
For me, for the time being, I can just
stay with mother-in-law at the hospital.

94
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.440
However, the situation for
the two of you is more urgent.

95
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.440
You don't even know when
he'll put you on the plane.

96
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.480
No!

97
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.380
Before that happens,
shouldn't we just send him off first?

98
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.860
Send who off?

99
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.960
Lee Byung Soo, of course!

100
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.280
That's right!

101
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.140
Why should we go?

102
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.160
Yes...

103
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.700
We should send him off,
that human being.

104
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.500
I like it.

105
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.320
But, how?

106
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.520
The person who can
send Lee Byung Soo off,

107
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.760
there is just one
person who can do that.

108
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.020
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

109
00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.040
Grandfather.

110
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.780
Ah, the Chairman?

111
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.920
The Chairman will make Jung
Hye's husband back off?

112
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.960
- That's exactly it!
- That's exactly it!

113
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.540
Then, this time as well, Jung Hye...

114
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.740
you'll have to come up with
a fantastic idea, won't you?

115
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.400
This time, it's going to be even cooler.

116
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.920
Fighting!

117
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.580
<i>[Haerang Construction,
Public Announcements]</i>

118
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.020
<i>[Haerang Construction 52nd
Regular Board Meeting]</i>

119
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.020
What is it?

120
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.140
Do you have something to say to me?

121
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.560
You just have to sign.

122
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.680
Just as you've always done.

123
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Thank you.

124
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.740
This is the first time I've seen her,
too.

125
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.860
They say that she doesn't
know how to do anything.

126
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.340
Oh.

127
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.680
Isn't that the elder daughter-in-law?

128
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.940
She never gets involved
in company business.

129
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.060
That is true.

130
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.800
Really.

131
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.220
Why are you here?

132
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.100
From now on, I've decided to take on all
my responsibilities as a shareholder.

133
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.860
It looks good (<i>to have her here</i>),
Father.

134
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.866
Hyung, you must feel supported.

135
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.340
Oh.

136
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.940
I asked her to come.

137
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.960
She should have some interest
in the business now after all.

138
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.460
You took my proxy yesterday.

139
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Let's get started.

140
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.475
The business meeting for the
proposed 2018 project of the

141
00:09:25.675 --> 00:09:27.340
Shanghai Shopping Center in China

142
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.160
is arranged for tomorrow.

143
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.040
Is that for certain?

144
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.420
I thought that Hosan Construction
had the inside line on that project.

145
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.380
The proposal that we
submitted with Geon Ah Group

146
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.880
is certainly looking attractive
to the buyers on that side.

147
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.660
Because that side had been working
with Geon Ah for a long time already,

148
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.780
Geon Ah was the one who brought us in.

149
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.360
I think that I should take charge...

150
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.080
I have!

151
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.000
already prepared everything.

152
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.600
Then, I will take part also.

153
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.320
Yes.

154
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.280
I will make sure it goes
off without a hitch.

155
00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:58.820
However,

156
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.380
where is the location of the meeting?

157
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.280
We appreciate you taking
interest in the company.

158
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.320
Going forward,
I'll take a greater interest.

159
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.840
Since this is the first time that
I've seen this side of you in 10 years,

160
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.180
I was a little surprised.

161
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.840
Did you have something
that concerned you?

162
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.700
As father-in-law also knows,
this person is much lacking.

163
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.700
From now on, I didn't think
that I should just stay still.

164
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.400
Hey!

165
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.660
This person, so embarrassing!

166
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.500
Father, I will take care of everything.

167
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.120
Just take care of yourself.

168
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.500
Those buyers, they're reputed to be
unbelievably proper and inflexible.

169
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.680
Are you sure you'll be okay?

170
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.600
I know.
That they abhor any time-wasting.

171
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.760
I've checked everything already.

172
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.000
Can I really trust you this time?

173
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.600
Yes.

174
00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.349
Because they said
that their schedule was tight,

175
00:10:59.549 --> 00:11:00.800
and they wanted to meet in the morning,

176
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.485
I also will spend the night at the hotel,

177
00:11:02.685 --> 00:11:04.440
so that I can be there
first thing in the morning.

178
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.220
This time, I'm really certain.

179
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.800
Please believe me, Father.

180
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.980
This is your final chance.

181
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.060
Why did you really come?

182
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.360
I had something to talk about
with brother-in-law and...

183
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:19.900
Why?

184
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.340
Were you going to give him your shares?

185
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.360
We'll see.

186
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.180
Really, that person...

187
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.620
Aigoo!

188
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.780
So,

189
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.700
you're saying that your husband
meeting that Chinese person

190
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.500
is a very important thing, right?

191
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.820
If that is messed up,

192
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.380
then the Chairman to
Jung Hye's husband...

193
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.400
Will completely kick him out.

194
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.940
Game over.

195
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.040
Then we'll have to do everything we can,
so that he doesn't meet them.

196
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.200
Let's get to work.

197
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
How do we mess it up?

198
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.820
Since he said that he's
sleeping at the hotel tonight...

199
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.820
We have to upend it tonight!

200
00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:57.300
Ah!

201
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.160
How about this?

202
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.540
Sister-in-law has left the house?

203
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.500
Why?

204
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.360
Someone was hit.

205
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.840
You hit her?

206
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.180
I was hit. I was.

207
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.560
Oh...

208
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.840
Oh...

209
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.400
Oh, what did you do that
sister-in-law would use violence...

210
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.480
Oh, I can't believe that...

211
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.540
Sister-in-law looks like
such a refined person.

212
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.440
That was the first time I knew of it
as well, that she had that side to her.

213
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.600
She'll return soon.

214
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.180
Keep up your strength, Sunbae.

215
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.700
The reception to the interview was good.

216
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.020
So, if you keep going this way to
the election, totally smooth...

217
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.060
How are you doing?

218
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.700
Apparently, the child's birth mother
came to the office

219
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.380
and raised a ruckus and everything?

220
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.400
Oh... trying to take care of that,
I had a really hard time.

221
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.080
The Chairman must have
been really angry.

222
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.220
This time, I'm going to get him to release
all of his anger at me in one shot.

223
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.900
Tomorrow, there is going to be
a major meeting with a buyer.

224
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.320
Oh, at least we have to do well.

225
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.720
How could things get
so bad for Sang Man...

226
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.320
I don't know how he's doing these days.

227
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.880
He said he was going to try to
form an organization or something.

228
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.780
That Avengers Club or whatever,

229
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.140
doesn't it seem as if we
shouldn't just ridicule it?

230
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.320
Oh, that's because Hong
Sunbae did some wrong things.

231
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.920
What could ajummas really do,
even if they try?

232
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.280
I'm just going to have this,
then I'll get up.

233
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.280
Since I have to prepare for
the meeting tomorrow morning.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.660

Oh.

What did you say?

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.300
- Do something! Quickly!
- Oh, wait! Mr. Chow! Mr. Chow! Mr. Chow!

333
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.570
Chow! Whoa. Whoa.

334
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.020
Whoa.

335
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.540
Whoa. I have a lot of contempt for you!

336
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.540
I have a lot of contempt for you!

337
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:24.000
Contempt for you!

338
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.470
Lee Byung Soo. Cleared!

339
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.670
Oh! Oh, it is different because
it's an expensive place.

340
00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.690
Aigoo.

341
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.510
Aigoo, this is so relaxing.

342
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.420
Aigoo.

343
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.920
Ah. Omo.

344
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.680
Ah! Oh! What is this?
Why are you suddenly so rough?

345
00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.210
Oh, just stay like that. Stay like that.

346
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.680
Oh, what are you doing?!

347
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.569
Jah, you have to do it like this
in order for it to be relaxing.

348
00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:04.110
Ah!

349
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.960
Ah! Ah!

350
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.800
Ah! What you are you doing?

351
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.580
- What are you doing? Ah!
- Don't scream.

352
00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.545
You'll dislocate your chin.

353
00:27:12.745 --> 00:27:14.440
There is something else
that you will have to do.

354
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.830
- What is this?! It was you? Ow! Ow!
- Do you want to do it or not?

355
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.530
- Stop this!
- Answer me first.

356
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.200
You have to let me up
so that I can speak. Ow!

357
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.680
Ow!

358
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.040
Ow!

359
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.040
Aw..

360
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.040
Aw.. it hurts so much.

361
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.950
Who is this? Who is this woman?

362
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.700
I'm Jung Hye's sister. What of it?

363
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.133
So, will you do it or not?

364
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.520
So. So, I don't know what it is, but
you'll have to give me more money for it.

365
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.440
Ah... No...

366
00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.840
Let's live kind lives, us.

367
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:05.630
Hurry.

368
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.140
Hurry up and pay me.

369
00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.915
Let's do the calculation after
you've done the interview.

370
00:28:09.115 --> 00:28:09.340
Ay!

371
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.340
Try acting properly for once.

372
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.800
But, what in the world is this picture?

373
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
There are a lot of eyes watching,
so why don't you leave?

374
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.320
Oh, I'm so scared.

375
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.760
Here, the room service is not that
great. Please tell them for me?

376
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.280
I'll see you later. Bye!

377
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:38.250
Then shall we go and debrief?

378
00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.710
Shall we go?

379
00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.710
Let's go. Let's go.

380
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.580
You trusted such a big business
deal to General Manager Lee.

381
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.120
Chairman, you must still have had some
expectations left of General Manager Lee.

382
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.457
Well, it was some business
that General Manager Lee

383
00:28:51.657 --> 00:28:53.300
had been in charge of
from the beginning.

384
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.000
When doing business, things can happen
that one didn't intend to happen.

385
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.433
I had thought that the Chairman
was someone who got things done.

386
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.980
However, I seem to have seen you wrong.

387
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.360
What does that mean?

388
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.053
Just because a grandson appeared,
you're giving General Manager Lee

389
00:29:06.253 --> 00:29:07.500
chances beyond reason right now.

390
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:10.200
In today's world,

391
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.880
a son, a son...

392
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.670
Isn't everyone like that?

393
00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:18.930
Even accomplished President Kim

394
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.233
would probably find it difficult to
become the successor to the Geon Ah Group.

395
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.280
That company whose meeting was messed
up is also an important partner of ours,

396
00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.965
if you take care of business like this,

397
00:29:28.165 --> 00:29:30.320
it makes us who introduced
them to you also look bad.

398
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.320
That was unfortunate.

399
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:36.060
- To Chairman Kim, I will separately...
- I..

400
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.060
have already told my father.

401
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.520
That our relationship
with Hae Rang has to be reconsidered.

402
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.800
I will directly see
him and speak with him.

403
00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.160
With this,
we can definitely send him off, right?

404
00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.000
Since grandfather saw, it's finished.

405
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.290
You saw the chairman's face.

406
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.520
The mission this time was
completely to my taste.

407
00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:06.970
Avengers Club!

408
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.960
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

409
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.020
I'm home!

410
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.700
Hee Soo!

411
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.860
Hello.

412
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.910
Here!

413
00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.490
All of these?

414
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.390
Shall I help you?

415
00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.140
Don't do it.

416
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.370
I'll help you.

417
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.010
Yes.

418
00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.133
Ramen needs green onions.

419
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.100
Should I put another one in?

420
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.000
What?

421
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.370
Why?

422
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.360
Come stay here. You can't just
continue to stay at the hospital.

423
00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.930
Hee Soo and Hee Kyung will
be uncomfortable, too.

424
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.760
No. Hee Kyung said she was going
to go to Noryangjin soon.

425
00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.633
Since there will be an empty room,
bring Seo Yeon and come stay here.

426
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.366
I'll talk it over with Seo Yeon.

427
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.500
Mi Sook, think about it carefully.

428
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.520
When you first came
to the Avengers Club,

429
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.933
you said that you were enduring
it for Seo Yeon's sake.

430
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:20.933
But, look.

431
00:31:21.133 --> 00:31:23.130
Seo Yeon is getting hurt, too.

432
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.920
So, I'm very sorry to Seo Yeon.

433
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.490
The way you feel,
now Seo Yeon will understand it as well.

434
00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.670
If there is anything that
unnie can help you with,

435
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.370
just tell me whatever and whenever.
Okay?

436
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.710
Please eat the ramen!

437
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.650
Let's go eat ramen.

438
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.430
Let's eat.

439
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.820
Let's eat. Let's eat. Let's eat.

440
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.080
I will eat well.

441
00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.240
What's so special about this?
All ramen are pretty.

442
00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.440
It is delicious anyway.

443
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.800
Oh, Jung Hye, you're going to burn
yourself. You'll burn. Burn. Oh!

444
00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.966
He can make more... oh, your hair... oh.

445
00:32:23.666 --> 00:32:26.860
Put some more water on the stove. Oh.

446
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.931
Wow, that's a total sweet potato,
sweet potato (something frustrating).

447
00:32:30.131 --> 00:32:31.640
Yes.

448
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.350
What is that?

449
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.000
What a sweet potato is...

450
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.890
Here are some sweet potatoes! Here.

451
00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.400
It's about time for the cider to come out.
(something refreshing or cleansing)

452
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.370
Hee Soo,
there some cider in the refrigerator.

453
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:55.320
Why do you keep laughing?

454
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.300
Cider tastes best after one
has eaten a sweet potato.

455
00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.910
I'll get you some cider.

456
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.180
What is he saying?

457
00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.040
He must have had a bite
go down the wrong way.

458
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.210
Oh, this has been really fun these days.

459
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:15.400
Definitely,
there has to be a proper slap.

460
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.620
Sister-in-law?
Isn't she coming home today either?

461
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:24.750
Just drink.

462
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:30.400
B.J. I should really do something
about them. I can't stand it any more.

463
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.520
BJ? What now?

464
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.460
Do you know what I suffered today?

465
00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.490
You suffered, too?

466
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.200
Father and the clients were all waiting,

467
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:40.760
but in the morning as
I was trying to leave,

468
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.320
the clothes were all gone, all the
telephone lines were disconnected.

469
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:44.920
The only clothes that were there,
the smell was...

470
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.840
Ow..

471
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.200
What the hell happened?
Did you get any evidence?

472
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.320
The hotel clerks say that the
CCTV is not allowed to be viewed.

473
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.270
However, there was no need to see them.

474
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.190
They left signs that they
were "BJ" everywhere.

475
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.510
Now they have nothing to be afraid of,

476
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.380
and their skills are evolving.

477
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.080
Why on earth are they doing this to us?

478
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.170
When did things go so wrong?

479
00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.980
Anyway, because of them,

480
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.850
I'm about to be kicked
completely OUT by father.

481
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.680
He told me to never even
step near the company.

482
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.880
Aw, I'm really going crazy.

483
00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:21.790
I'm going crazy, too.

484
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.360
Mom, shall we meet directly
at the market tomorrow?

485
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.220
Yes. I will be there buying groceries,
so come there quickly after school.

486
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.970
After mom and I prepare everything,

487
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.970
let's call noona just
when the ceremony begins.

488
00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.120
Yes. She is almost living
in the library these days.

489
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.280
- Mom,
- What?

490
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.110
are you not meeting
your friend these days?

491
00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.780
My friends just left a little while ago.

492
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.720
No, that time when you were
in front of the house...

493
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:52.960
Um?

494
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.170
No.

495
00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:57.640
Good night.

496
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.800
Hey!

497
00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.520
Get out.

498
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.830
Was it fun?

499
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.080
Yes. It was really worth watching.

500
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.470
Wow, now you just have nothing
to be cautious about, do you?

501
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.040
If you're drunk, just go to bed quietly.

502
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.120
- How dare you come here making a fuss?
- You..

503
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.730
Did you take your property back
to do these kinds of things?

504
00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.560
BJ! Do you think I will
just leave you alone?

505
00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:31.950
- And, if you don't?
- Uh?

506
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.980
You guys disturbed three people already!

507
00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.040
I don't know what you're talking about,
but first bring some evidence.

508
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.180
I, who was victimized,...
We are the evidence!

509
00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.800
Stop doing silly things
and just pack your bags!

510
00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:58.000
Sh.. You son of b...

511
00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.810
Oh no! I can't.

512
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:06.880
It's an examinee's room,
why don't you knock?

513
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.520
Whatever. Just unlock this quickly.

514
00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.880
How would I know father's pattern?

515
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:13.580
If you don't know, then who would know?

516
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.550
I feel unfairly treated.

517
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.590
Oww. OK. Just do something.

518
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.210
It will be... or...

519
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.350
It was...

520
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.160
Oww..

521
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:34.240
You.. really..

522
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:40.280
You... that... I know all about you doing
weird things hanging out with the ajummas!

523
00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.310
Stop it while I'm still
telling you nicely, ok?

524
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:44.600
What are you talking about?

525
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.620
I need to study. Please get out.

526
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.160
Aigoo, this!

527
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:53.690
I clearly warned you.

528
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.740
What is it?

529
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.230
What? She's at the hotel?

530
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.230
Yes. But the reservation
was made in madam's name.

531
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.340
What? Right now...

532
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:18.970
Just leave it as it is for now.

533
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.030
These people...

534
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.520
Lee Byung Soo is trying to send
that child and me abroad.

535
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:34.640
So?

536
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.960
I heard father has given his permission.

537
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:40.200
Does father pay any attention
to you wherever you are?

538
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.570
It's just that General
Manager Lee pushed for it,

539
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.670
and Jung Joon also
joined in asking for it,

540
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.380
so that's why he did it.

541
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.890
I will not leave.

542
00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:51.920
Is there anything you
can do as you want to?

543
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.830
I will make it happen as I want it to.

544
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.540
Anyway the decision will be
made by General Manager Lee.

545
00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.130
He always did after all?

546
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.170
I'm going to throw away Lee Byung Soo.

547
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.560
Will that be accepted
by the two families?

548
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.440
That's why I suggested a deal to you.

549
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.820
Are you asking me to stand on your side?

550
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.300
The stock shares that I have

551
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.330
isn't that what you need the most?

552
00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.740
Oh! We meet again here.

553
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:40.620
- Ah. We meet again.
- Yes, we are.

554
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.280
He is my son.

555
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.410
Ah, is he? He is good looking.

556
00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:51.790
Are you going home?

557
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.830
Ah, yes.

558
00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.320
Your packages look heavy,
I will drive you to your home.

559
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.760
I brought my car.

560
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.650
We're ok.

561
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.990
Then...

562
00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.520
Ah, does your knife work well?

563
00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.140
Ah, yes, yes.

564
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.230
That's good.

565
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.440
You're the first person who ever
came to me to sharpen a knife.

566
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.560
- I will see you again.
- Yes.

567
00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.440
Let's go.

568
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.430
I told you to come after you finish
your studies, why did you come so early?

569
00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.680
I myself should cook
the greens father liked.

570
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.160
- Uh, aigoo. Where is my head?
- Why?

571
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.030
Did you not get something?

572
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.720
I didn't buy the bracken.

573
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.720
That..

574
00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.120
is what father likes the most.

575
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.800
Why is he being like that?

576
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.720
Your father did indeed
love bracken a lot.

577
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.740
Come to think of it, these days,

578
00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:09.560
he would start to say something then
stop, start to say something then stop.

579
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.960
- Mom, by any chance...
- What?

580
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:20.170
- Son.
- Yes?

581
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.390
Hee Soo.

582
00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:33.660
It's not like that.

583
00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:39.760
That ajusshi a while ago,
did you think he was my boyfriend?

584
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.400
I also saw him drive you home before.

585
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.930
Ah, at that time, I just...

586
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.500
I just went to him to sharpen a knife,
and it was raining...

587
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:58.330
Anyway,
it's not like what you're thinking.

588
00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:02.060
He is just a carpenter, a carpenter.

589
00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.010
For me, it's because mom
didn't tell me anything,

590
00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:09.230
that was what made me sad. For me, it's
because mom didn't tell me anything,

591
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:10.460
that was what made me sad.

592
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:17.820
And, I can't yet imagine a man who
isn't my dad standing beside you.

593
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.380
Aigoo. Aigoo, my son.

594
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:28.120
If I did have a boyfriend,
I would first ask you to check him out.

595
00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:31.770
Let's quickly get things ready.

596
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.500
Noona will ruin it all.

597
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.000
Yes yes.

598
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.290
You have to help in order
to make things properly.

599
00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.280
Yes, Seo Yeon. I'm packing the luggage
at home right now so that I can go.

600
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.080
Yes. I'll go now.

601
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.400
Yeobo.

602
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.180
Let go.

603
00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:00.280
I did wrong, so stop doing this
and come back home with Seo Yeon.

604
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.490
The elections are going to be soon.
And, tomorrow, we have a couple meeting.

605
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.160
Stop it.

606
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:07.760
What?

607
00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.440
The election, stop it.

608
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:11.980
You are not qualified.

609
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.110
You made our Seo Jin like that.

610
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.380
And not only me,
but also you did it to Seo Yeon.

611
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.070
And you're making it
harder on mother now.

612
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.170
If I become the Superintendent of
Education, everything will be fine,

613
00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:21.500
but you can't even endure
it just a few more days?!

614
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.800
I have no more reason
to endure it any longer.

615
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.200
Hey!

616
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.920
At that time, I did something
that I was apologetic for,

617
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.490
so I was going to treat you once.

618
00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:46.620
However, sister-in-law called
me first even. I feel happy.

619
00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.700
I heard you met my father?

620
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.630
To ask him to send Jung Hye
and the child abroad?

621
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.860
Ah, sister-in-law,
you also saw the rumor tabloid, right?

622
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.950
Aigoo. It was so hard to block that.

623
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.440
I don't know how father-in-law knew
about it, but he was also very concerned.

624
00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.640
General Manager Lee was the
one who told him, weren't you?

625
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.250
Maybe because the kid was born
and raised in the countryside,

626
00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:18.440
he just wasn't able to
become accustomed to things.

627
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:20.730
So if he can broaden his
horizons at a foreign university,

628
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.910
it would be good for him.

629
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.640
Then,
sending just the child should be enough.

630
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:31.550
Aiooo. Definitely,
the mother should take care of him.

631
00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.930
Anyway, she has nothing to do here.

632
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.520
You're working hard,
General Manager Lee.

633
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.490
If you get rid of the two of them,
do you think anything will be changed?

634
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:48.800
What are you talking about?
It's for the sake of those two people.

635
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.760
I will discuss it again with my father.

636
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.490
There's no need to rush, right?

637
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.320
Sister-in-law seemed
to be a little strange.

638
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.180
I thought she would be the happiest one
if my wife were gone.

639
00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:07.600
Haha...

640
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.040
Of course I have to continue to do it.

641
00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.220
Anyway, Father-in-law doesn't
care about my wife at all.

642
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.020
Are you going somewhere?

643
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.680
I am asking you.

644
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.640
When did you start to
have such interest in me?

645
00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:54.500
Depart.

646
00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:56.680
Tsk.

647
00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.240
Today's concept is

648
00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.780
sorrowful mistress style.

649
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.200
It should be photogenic,
don't you think?

650
00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.340
The interview material...

651
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.720
you have memorized it, haven't you?

652
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.360
Ow, how many times do have I said it?

653
00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.960
19 years old Han Soo Ji first
met 20 years old Lee Byung Soo

654
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.520
And the two of them were
together for one night.

655
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.560
In the situation of finding out that I
was pregnant, I was dumped by the asshole.

656
00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.060
And I gave birth to the child by myself.

657
00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.840
Then I myself dumped the child.

658
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.580
Ah... ah..

659
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.340
Ah...

660
00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.460
The most important thing
is what comes after that.

661
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.380
I was going to say that...

662
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:36.440
Impatient, impatient.

663
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.560
You are too impatient.

664
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.152
Lee Byung Soo wouldn't
recognize the existence

665
00:45:40.352 --> 00:45:41.820
of the child for all of these 18 years.

666
00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.520
Then in order to become the successor,

667
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.280
he brought the child home.

668
00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.020
But now he thinks the child is annoying,

669
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.320
so he is dumping the child again.

670
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.320
That's right, isn't it?

671
00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.160
Any questions regarding Soo Gyum,
don't answer them.

672
00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.100
Ah... I know it.

673
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.440
How many times do I have to say it?

674
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.120
Now, let's go.

675
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.080
Are you getting used to living there?

676
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.120
Better than staying at home.

677
00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.680
There's no need to look at me like that.

678
00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.740
What did I do?

679
00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.720
Since I like it a lot better now.

680
00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:33.460
You had asked before me
whether I really hate my mom, right?

681
00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:34.460
I did.

682
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.060
That the reason mom was enduring
everything was because of me.

683
00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.080
That was what I hated.

684
00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.080
If it was truly for me,

685
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.360
then that wasn't it.

686
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.080
Yes.

687
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.680
I think I get what you mean.

688
00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.960
Hae Rang Construction
General Manager Lee Byung Soo

689
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.780
I first met him when I was 19 years old.

690
00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.260
It was love at first sight.

691
00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.880
So, we became passionate lovers.

692
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.620
And, I became pregnant.

693
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.540
But once he found out
about my pregnancy,

694
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.200
that person suddenly started to change.

695
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.280
I told you not to come.

696
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.780
How can I take it easy?

697
00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.320
Who knows what useless thing
she is going to do?

698
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.560
The article will be
released tomorrow morning.

699
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.040
And, Han Soo Ji will leave before that.

700
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.040
That's great.

701
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.680
After the article is published,

702
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.600
Father will be busy
taking care of his mess.

703
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.740
And, Madam can carry on with your plan.

704
00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.020
I have agreed to make a deal with
President Kim Jung Yoon.

705
00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:18.340
A deal?

706
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.480
Like the one she made with me?

707
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.900
For the price of giving her my shares,

708
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.680
she agreed to stand my side to help me.

709
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.300
You didn't have to do that.

710
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:29.900
Grandfather.

711
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.140
My "ankle".

712
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.920
I'll let you " grab" it.

713
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:33.880
What?

714
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.460
It looks as if you have a request.

715
00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.700
Please let go of Madam.

716
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.420
I will let you "grab my ankle".

717
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.100
But instead,

718
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.680
please let Madam go.

719
00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.800
You don't have to do this.

720
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.500
This is also my revenge.

721
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.580
You must definitely leave this home.

722
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.680
For revenge?

723
00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.440
For yourself.

724
00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.620
Get out, and live a free life.

725
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.080
That is the real revenge.

726
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.080
Son.

727
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.120
Goodbye.

728
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.320
Son.

729
00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.680
You're not going to be hurt by
this kind of stuff like a hick, are you?

730
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:38.860
Go your own way.

731
00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:41.560
That's right.

732
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:43.460
If only you had made this
decision so cleanly before,

733
00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.440
wouldn't it have been
better for both of us?

734
00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.240
Each of us should now
separately live well.

735
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:04.220
Let's go.

736
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:13.466
[A special gift from the ASC family.]

737
00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.900
You know that the real
interview is tomorrow?

738
00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.020
Of course.

739
00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:26.680
Just quickly give me what you promised.

740
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.720
After the interview is finished,
after I've confirmed it.

741
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:30.900
Sigh...

742
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.760
Then just quickly give me the script.

743
00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:34.920
What did you want me to say?

744
00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.880
Do it properly for once.

745
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.880
This will be the last
time for you and me.

746
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.840
You definitely promised to give me
double of what that woman gave me.

747
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.260
I know. I will!

748
00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.060
The article is definitely
being released tomorrow?

749
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.060
I understand.

750
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.760
Seo Jin...

751
00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:21.240
My baby.

752
00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:24.780
Mom.

753
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.520
Grandmother has been sleeping
continuously since yesterday.

754
00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:31.820
It's strange.

755
00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.160
Here.

756
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.460
Mom will go bring the doctor.

757
00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.340
Okay.

758
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.040
Yeobo.

759
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:12.860
Yeobo!

760
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:14.680
That...

761
00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:15.740
Mother-in-law now...

762
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.080
Why haven't you been
answering your phone?

763
00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:17.840
What?

764
00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:19.340
This...

765
00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:20.260
You...

766
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.140
I'm so busy anyway,
did you have to make me come here?

767
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.980
Didn't I tell you that we have a couples
gathering today with Senator Choi?

768
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.780
Now is not the time for this.

769
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.480
Mother-in-law...

770
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.920
Stop making excuses using Mother!

771
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.420
It is not as if it's
only been once or twice!

772
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.360
You're trying to destroy what I am
doing, so you're doing this on purpose!

773
00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:42.440
You really want to see me go crazy?

774
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:44.900
Mom!

775
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.260
Grandmother is...!

776
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.140
Mother-in-law.

777
00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.200
Yes?

778
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:43.740
Here.

779
00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.280
Mother-in-law.

780
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:54.980
My daughter.

781
00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.380
I'm fine.

782
00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:04.440
Everything is fine.

783
00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.580
You can't.

784
00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.720
If Mother-in-law leaves,
then what will I do?

785
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.080
My daughter.

786
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.060
My Mi Sook.

787
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.360
Now

788
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.460
don't suffer

789
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.540
any longer...

790
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:39.940
Mother!

791
00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:41.320
<i>Autumn night,</i>

792
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:41.750
Mother! <i>Autumn night,</i>

793
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.980
<i>Autumn night,</i>

794
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:42.600
Grandmother! <i>Autumn night,</i>

795
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:42.460
<i>Autumn night,</i>

796
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:42.940
Mother! <i>Autumn night,</i>

797
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:43.220
<i>Autumn night,</i>

798
00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:43.940
Mother! <i>Autumn night,</i>

799
00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:44.660
<i>Autumn night,</i>

800
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.160
<i>Silent night,</i>

801
00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.440
Mother... <i>Silent night,</i>

802
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:48.320
Mother...

803
00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:53.140
<i>A sleepless night.</i>

804
00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.700
<i>When the cry of the wild goose</i>

805
00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.560
Mother.
<i>When the cry of the wild goose</i>

806
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.420
<i>When the cry of the wild goose</i>

807
00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:01.400
<i>rises and falls,</i>

808
00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.780
Mother. <i>rises and falls,</i>

809
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.160
<i>rises and falls,</i>

810
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:17.020
<i>Missing mom's arms,</i>

811
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:23.120
<i>tears start to fall,</i>

812
00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.320
<i>At the end of the floor,</i>

813
00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.740
<i>sit down with me</i>

814
00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:40.160
<i>and count the stars.</i>

815
00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:17.780
Sir.

979
01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.400
Let's go together.

980
01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:27.220
Let's go. I think I know where she is.

981
01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:29.220
I'm going to leave first.

982
01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.050
Yes, this is she.

983
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.120
My mother's hospital?

984
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:43.650
<i>Is everything Han Soo Ji said all true?</i>

985
01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:46.800
<i>Is it true you threatened
her financially?</i>

986
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.070
<i>Is this something that Geon Ah Group and
Haerang Construction already knew also?</i>

987
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:50.170
<i>Did Geon Ah tell you to do it?</i>

988
01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:52.200
<i>- Please say a word.
- Is it true?</i>

989
01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:57.850
<i>What do you say to the allegations? Do
you acknowledge it? Please say something.</i>

990
01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:01.550
While changing the sheets on the bed,
I found this.

991
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.270
Yes, thank you.

992
01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:07.970
What is it?

993
01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:17.650
What is this?

994
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.370
Th-th-thiis is that? Right?

995
01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:42.920
Yes. I think it is.

996
01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:45.550
Wow. This is daebak.

997
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.900
Outside,
there seemed to be quite a commotion.

998
01:08:58.150 --> 01:08:59.970
You, how far do you want to take this?

999
01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:00.850
You?

1000
01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:03.050
Where did you hide that woman?

1001
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.520
I packed up the larger items.

1002
01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:08.600
Who said we were going?

1003
01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.800
What's your reason for doing this?

1004
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.600
I already told you.

1005
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.750
Soo Gyum will go and get a good education,
and you will be able to live freely.

1006
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:18.600
This is good for everyone.

1007
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.970
Do you think you'll get your way?

1008
01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.820
Right now, father-in-law and my
father are both in an uproar.

1009
01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:26.550
To get rid of you immediately.

1010
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:31.870
So, get a grasp of the situation,
and prepare yourself quickly.

1011
01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:34.900
Ow!

1012
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:38.070
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

1013
01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:40.160
The person you are makes me sick.

1014
01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.950
What about me? You think I like this?

1015
01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:44.020
I regret all the time
I spent enduring you!

1016
01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.400
Do you think you were the only
one who had to endure it?!

1017
01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.570
In order to try to live with you,
I had to put in so much effort!

1018
01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:49.320
Effort?

1019
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.970
Are you a human being
even capable of that?

1020
01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.020
What makes you think
you can act this way?

1021
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:59.820
Back then you told me that
I was nothing, didn't you?

1022
01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:00.720
Then what about you?

1023
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.620
Illegitimate daughter of Geon Ah Group,

1024
01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.300
daughter-in-law of Haerang Group,

1025
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.420
wife of Lee Byung Soo!

1026
01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.150
Of those things, what do you think you
were able to get on your own merits?

1027
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:10.670
That's why I've decided to
live differently this time.

1028
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:15.750
Why?

1029
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:19.020
You want to try a divorce?

1030
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:20.820
What a shame.

1031
01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.070
That should have come
out of my mouth first.

1032
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:25.820
Let me say it again then.

1033
01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:27.620
Lee Byung Soo,

1034
01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:29.820
I won't live with you any longer.

1035
01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.820
Let's divorce.

1036
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:37.520
You don't know your place.

1037
01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.950
Divorce?

1038
01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:41.220
Listen carefully.

1039
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.920
If you end it with me, you are nothing.

1040
01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.350
What remains of you without me?

1041
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:49.460
It would leave me.

1042
01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.570
And what are you?

1043
01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:51.970
I...

1044
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:55.600
am Kim Jung Hye.

1045
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.750
Preview

1046
01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:28.200
If it ends this way, we're all dead.

1047
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:28.900
Is there no way?

1048
01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.150
We need to stop them.

1049
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.600
How?

1050
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.600
My wife, because of that shock,

1051
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.500
right now is being treated with
powerful psychiatric drugs.

1052
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.520
Now there is no longer
anything to hide or lie about.

1053
01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.750
We can live the way we want.

1054
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:43.070
Now, no matter what those women say,
no one will believe them.

1055
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:45.820
I will now show you an exclusive.

1056
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:48.220
Avengers Club. Do you think that
it will happen as you want it to?

1057
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.500
Now, there is nothing to be afraid of
and nothing that I won't be able to do.

1058
01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:52.750
Let's talk separately.

1059
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:53.800
You,

1060
01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.420
I told you I wouldn't leave you alone.

1061
01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.620
"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas,
Oppas, Unnies and Dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club"
