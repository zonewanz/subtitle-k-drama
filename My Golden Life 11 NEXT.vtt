00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.730
(Episode 11)

4
00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:20.010
Hello.

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.179
I'm newly appointed as a regular employee...

6
00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:24.649
at the Haesung Apparel Marketing Team.

7
00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.090
My name is Seo Ji An.

8
00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.260
Nice to meet you.

9
00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:33.959
Ji An.

10
00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.230
- Ji An's here. - Ji An.

11
00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:38.400
How are you?

12
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.870
What's going on?

13
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.809
Well, she used to be on the regular employee list.

14
00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510
That list was found during an internal inspection.

15
00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:49.279
Really?

16
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.550
But we didn't mean to do that to her.

17
00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:56.779
Sir, shouldn't you check on this?

18
00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:58.650
As the marketing team was separated,

19
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.319
we were supposed to be in charge of the apparel,

20
00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.389
and the FNB Marketing Team was newly composed.

21
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.090
Why is she on our team instead of the other one?

22
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.760
Right. I think there's been a mistake.

23
00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.999
Why must this happen while I was away at a funeral?

24
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.770
Anyway, welcome.

25
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.240
Welcome, Ji An.

26
00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.180
Sir, shouldn't we assign her a seat first?

27
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.150
She's even wearing a regular employee card.

28
00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:34.159
Use the empty desk next to Ha Jung.

29
00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:35.960
Yes, sir.

30
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.689
Good to see you all again.

31
00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:40.329
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

32
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.570
Nice to see you again, Ji An.

33
00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:46.529
Nice to see you too.

34
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.809
I bet you all missed my coffee.

35
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.609
I'll serve coffee to celebrate my first day.

36
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.779
Ji An, you don't have to bring us coffee anymore.

37
00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:58.680
I'm aware of that. It's been a while though.

38
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.579
I'll bring you coffee for my reemployment.

39
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.079
This is the last time though.

40
00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:13.830
What happened to you?

41
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.400
The company was wise enough to mend mistakes,

42
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.099
so they corrected it as it should have been.

43
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.430
That's not what I meant.

44
00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.900
Did you win the lottery or something?

45
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.800
I'm talking about the outfit you're wearing,

46
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.270
including your bag, shoes, and earrings.

47
00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.180
Maybe I did win the lottery.

48
00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.450
You did?

49
00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.650
I just dressed up because it's my first day back.

50
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.890
But you can't afford those.

51
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.219
Your entire outfit would cost over 5,000 dollars.

52
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.759
Ms. Yoon.

53
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.059
Don't pry into my personal life.

54
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.729
Are we friends?

55
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.059
Not anymore.

56
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.400
Treat me as your alumna and colleague only.

57
00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.469
Hey, I'm your senior colleague.

58
00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.170
I would have been your senior colleague...

59
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.569
if I became a regular employee on schedule.

60
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.180
You stole my position with your connections.

61
00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.009
Anyway, since I was hired after I was fired,

62
00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.650
I will accept you as my senior colleague.

63
00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.090
But only if you behave like one.

64
00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:22.114
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

65
00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.969
Ha Jung, you must feel awkward.

66
00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.370
Did you apologize to her?

67
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.499
What apology?

68
00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:31.640
She has connections too.

69
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.870
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.640
She had the best performance review.

71
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.240
Ms. Song,

72
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.879
do you know how much her bag costs?

73
00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:42.249
That's a designer handbag.

74
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.620
That's not a designer handbag.

75
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.490
It's just a simple leather bag.

76
00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.289
When people buy designer handbags by a rare chance,

77
00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:51.229
they buy handbags from Louis Vuitton, Gucci,

78
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.960
or Prada to show off they're expensive bags.

79
00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.330
But really rich people...

80
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.629
carry brands that only they know.

81
00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.170
Items that don't look too obvious.

82
00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.930
Come on. I'm sure it's a knockoff.

83
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.999
Her outfit isn't the only thing that has changed.

84
00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.900
She's giving off a whole different aura.

85
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.710
She's feeling confident and showing off.

86
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.340
Don't be unreasonable.

87
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.840
Apologize, and think about how you two can get along.

88
00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.879
Besides, connections don't form that quickly.

89
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.319
If she had connections, she wouldn't be nice.

90
00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.820
She would have kicked you out and stolen your seat.

91
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.250
I was hired by a special employment plan!

92
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.460
I can go home already?

93
00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:24.130
We sold all of our baked goods,

94
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.859
and don't you need to prepare for Chuseok too?

95
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.429
Where are you going for the holidays?

96
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.960
Are you visiting your parents?

97
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.340
That's none of your business.

98
00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.469
Oh, right. And why do you always eat cup noodles?

99
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.779
- What's wrong with that? - I mean...

100
00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:43.539
You put all of your effort...

101
00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.279
into the bread our customers eat,

102
00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:47.349
but you don't take care of yourself.

103
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.450
If you accept me as your pupil,

104
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.219
I will treat you as my master.

105
00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.289
I can cook you all three of your daily meals.

106
00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.960
I cook Korean, Chinese, and Japanese food.

107
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.229
I'm not interested.

108
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.900
Gosh, do you still not like me?

109
00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.539
Let me tell you this one last time.

110
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.369
I don't want to make a lot of money,

111
00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:12.710
I don't want to leave behind my skills,

112
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.840
and I'm afraid that I might live a long life.

113
00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:17.750
So Ji Soo, I only need you...

114
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.810
as a part-timer.

115
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:20.979
Okay?

116
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.179
If you don't like that, you may resign.

117
00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:24.950
Why though?

118
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.260
Why won't you leave behind your dough-making skills?

119
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.429
When I leave,

120
00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.099
I don't want to leave a trace of me.

121
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.369
You're going to close down?

122
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.440
Mr. Kang!

123
00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.109
No more questions.

124
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.340
Merry Chuseok.

125
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.580
He really has no plans of teaching me his skills.

126
00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:18.770
Excuse me. Is anyone home?

127
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.250
Ji An. Seo Ji An.

128
00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.060
That's Mr. Sun.

129
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.060
What is he doing in our neighborhood?

130
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.169
Ha Jung.

131
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.710
Is the Five Senses Project going well?

132
00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.779
Of course. I'm planning how to carry it out.

133
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.450
When will you be done looking over the proposal?

134
00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:00.279
When will you contact the enterprises...

135
00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:01.779
and select them?

136
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.650
I'm not looking it over. I'm planning it now.

137
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.989
Hold on, sir.

138
00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:10.419
This proposal was submitted by Ji An first.

139
00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:13.659
Then shouldn't she execute the project?

140
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.799
The Five Senses Project...

141
00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:18.570
Were you talking about the proposal I came up with?

142
00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:20.169
No way.

143
00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.640
You ordered me to take charge of that project.

144
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.070
I did say that because Ji An wasn't here then...

145
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.810
What are you doing with my proposal?

146
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.279
That was an event for the 40th anniversary.

147
00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:30.340
That's precisely it.

148
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.479
A celebratory event for Haesung Apparel's...

149
00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:33.950
40th anniversary.

150
00:07:34.049 --> 00:07:35.049
Really?

151
00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:37.820
Well, I read your proposal after you left,

152
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.289
and I thought it was a good idea.

153
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.859
So I submitted it under Ha Jung's name.

154
00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:43.119
Then...

155
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.460
my proposal was selected?

156
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.299
That's not what's important here.

157
00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:48.500
Then what is?

158
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.299
Carrying it out is what matters now.

159
00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:53.200
It's me who's been handling it for weeks...

160
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.570
under the general manager's orders.

161
00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:57.969
That was only a rough draft.

162
00:07:57.969 --> 00:07:59.710
The details weren't included in the proposal.

163
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.179
I came up with that over only one night.

164
00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:02.310
How has it been developed?

165
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.250
Why should I tell you that?

166
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.380
Sir,

167
00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:07.919
I think you should give it back to Ji An.

168
00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:10.919
But Ha Jung has been working on it until now.

169
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.590
Do you want to work on it together?

170
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.060
- I don't want to. - Together?

171
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.890
How about this?

172
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.390
Since we need the detailed draft of the proposal,

173
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.960
both of them should work on it,

174
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.200
and we'll decide between the two during a meeting.

175
00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:25.900
That's a good idea. Does everyone agree?

176
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.299
That would be reasonable.

177
00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:29.500
- I agree. - Sure.

178
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.869
- I agree as well. - So do I.

Gosh, did I still have this?

00:09:33.629 --> 00:09:35.200
I used to be so successful.

189
00:09:35.739 --> 00:09:38.969
But why am I struggling to get back out there?

190
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.190
Honey, are you...

191
00:09:52.489 --> 00:09:54.790
really thinking about running a business again?

192
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.489
Don't prepare the table for Chuseok.

193
00:09:56.489 --> 00:09:58.160
I'll visit my mom's grave...

194
00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.690
and hold the memorial service there.

195
00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:02.530
Okay. Have it your way.

196
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.229
Tell me how your first day of work went.

197
00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:09.840
Didn't they make you feel uncomfortable?

198
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.540
Everyone was so nice to me.

199
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.780
At first, they felt a bit awkward,

200
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.310
but they got over that quickly.

201
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.609
That's how your colleagues treated you.

202
00:10:18.609 --> 00:10:20.210
He's asking about how you felt.

203
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.349
It was touching.

204
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.219
I became a regular employee at the company...

205
00:10:27.219 --> 00:10:28.660
where I used to work as a contract employee.

206
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.859
"It was touching"?

207
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.790
Are you still not aware of who you are?

208
00:10:35.999 --> 00:10:38.369
It would be more dangerous if she changed so quickly.

209
00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:40.269
Do Kyung is right on this.

210
00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:42.769
Before we make our official announcement,

211
00:10:42.969 --> 00:10:45.570
she must stay as an employee, Seo Ji An.

212
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.210
She may behave as such,

213
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.210
but she must prepare herself.

214
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.379
It's because I'm a bit excited.

215
00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:55.749
There's a chance that I might be...

216
00:10:55.749 --> 00:10:58.149
in charge of the 40th anniversary event.

217
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.790
Why would they give you such a big project...

218
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.160
as soon as you are rehired?

219
00:11:02.619 --> 00:11:04.430
There was a contest for proposals for the event,

220
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.690
and it was open to all employees.

221
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.060
But contract workers couldn't participate,

222
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.430
so I wasn't going to submit mine.

223
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.530
However, the manager let me submit...

224
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.340
since he was sure I would become a regular employee.

225
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.310
The Five Senses Project?

226
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.639
How did you know about that?

227
00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:21.540
That was yours?

228
00:11:21.609 --> 00:11:23.280
But it wasn't under your name.

229
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.180
My contract had ended,

230
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.619
but he really liked my proposal.

231
00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:31.519
So he submitted it under someone else's name.

232
00:11:31.719 --> 00:11:33.619
He plagiarized your idea?

233
00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:35.989
I was going to tell you about this.

234
00:11:35.989 --> 00:11:38.629
We should hold a training session for our employees.

235
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.259
They broke our promise to contract workers too.

236
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.859
Let's talk about work at the company.

237
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.729
Eun Seok, you may go upstairs.

238
00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:48.800
Yes. I must come up with a detailed proposal too.

239
00:11:48.969 --> 00:11:50.469
I will go up now.

240
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:56.239
She seems to be motivated.

241
00:11:57.109 --> 00:11:59.410
It's as if someone is making it all work.

242
00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:02.550
If she takes charge of the event and does well,

243
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.119
she would be making a big contribution.

244
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.359
Support her without making it obvious.

245
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.989
I will.

246
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.530
I'm coming.

247
00:12:24.239 --> 00:12:25.639
- Welcome. - Welcome.

248
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.109
Eun Seok, say hello.

249
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.979
They are your aunt and uncle.

250
00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:39.950
How have you been, Aunt and Uncle?

251
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.560
Not "Hello", but "How have you been"?

252
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.499
Look how elegant she is.

253
00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.229
I am glad you're back, Niece.

254
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.369
Thank you.

255
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.139
I'm glad to see you again, Niece.

256
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.080
Thank you for welcoming me.

257
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.050
She's just like when Myung Hee was young.

258
00:13:05.609 --> 00:13:07.780
She's just as clever as her.

259
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.960
When you were young, you resembled your mom.

260
00:13:18.229 --> 00:13:19.989
But now, you resemble your dad more.

261
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:21.629
Does she?

262
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:25.430
Isn't it hard to keep up with your mom's training?

263
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.170
I'm still not enough, so I'm trying to learn a lot.

264
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.310
It's strange to eat without having...

265
00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:39.080
the ancestral ritual.

266
00:13:39.979 --> 00:13:42.719
Dad, I know Ji An left,

267
00:13:42.719 --> 00:13:44.920
but we're still here. Why don't we have the ritual?

268
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.389
Our grandparents would be upset.

269
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.989
I am going to go and hold a ritual alone.

270
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160
Are you going...

271
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.430
to Gangwon Province right after breakfast?

272
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.200
Let's go together.

273
00:13:57.229 --> 00:13:58.300
- I'll come too. - Me too.

274
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.700
No. I want to go alone.

275
00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:03.200
I want to...

276
00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:05.410
It happens when you get old.

277
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.840
I want to go back...

278
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.680
to being a young son again and sit in front of them.

279
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.780
I see. Is that why old people are like babies?

280
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.050
Eat up.

281
00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:25.160
I have something to say before Dad leaves.

282
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.930
Why are you so serious?

283
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.460
Well,

284
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.200
until the college entrance exam,

285
00:14:32.869 --> 00:14:35.739
can I stay at a dorm next to the academy?

286
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.340
A dorm?

287
00:14:37.469 --> 00:14:39.739
Because I leave early and take the last train home,

288
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:43.609
I lack sleep. I get five hours of sleep.

289
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.149
It's a waste of time going back and forth.

290
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.979
Your study fees and allowances are big enough.

291
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.619
Ji An stopped giving us money too,

292
00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.920
but you want to move out?

293
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.090
I won't spend to travel, and they will feed me.

294
00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.030
The exam is only in one and a half months.

295
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:02.859
Also, I already have made arrangements...

296
00:15:02.859 --> 00:15:04.469
for part-time jobs after the exam.

297
00:15:04.769 --> 00:15:05.969
No.

298
00:15:05.969 --> 00:15:08.070
You have anemia, and even your nose bled.

299
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.139
You should at least keep having homemade meals.

300
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.340
His nose bled?

301
00:15:13.769 --> 00:15:15.540
Perhaps you picked your nose?

302
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.940
That's not it.

303
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.050
His face had turned pale because he got dizzy.

304
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.749
You only have a month and a half until the exam.

305
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:25.019
Change of environment won't do you any good.

306
00:15:25.649 --> 00:15:28.019
You've been living here, but your grades went up.

307
00:15:34.999 --> 00:15:36.259
Ms. Oh.

308
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.229
We thought Eun Seok was with you, but she's back.

309
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.769
She will greet you.

310
00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.090
You can move back.

311
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.160
Myung Soo.

312
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.330
Yes, Father.

313
00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:11.999
I ordered to appoint Do Kyung...

314
00:16:11.999 --> 00:16:14.070
as the vice president of Haesung Apparel.

315
00:16:14.869 --> 00:16:15.869
What?

316
00:16:17.099 --> 00:16:19.210
When the sea is too calm for too long,

317
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.509
the wind won't blow.

318
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.979
If you are frustrated,

319
00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:26.509
let the young man make a change.

320
00:16:28.849 --> 00:16:29.979
Yes, sir.

321
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.019
Step forward now.

322
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.729
Father is the eldest among his four siblings.

323
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.700
His parents have all passed away.

324
00:16:49.999 --> 00:16:51.440
If he's the eldest,

325
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:54.780
why isn't he having a ritual for his family?

326
00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.810
He goes to his hometown after the holidays.

327
00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.509
As the eldest son-in-law, he should host our ritual.

328
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.349
Besides, his parents have all passed away.

329
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.320
But still, they are his parents.

330
00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:08.720
Shouldn't he hold a ritual for them as the eldest?

331
00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:10.119
Then what about here?

332
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.290
Grandfather has only two daughters.

333
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.060
Well, he could take turns then.

334
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.929
Or they could host the rituals together here.

335
00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:18.570
It was Dad's choice.

336
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.939
That's why he's the vice chairman of Haesung Group.

337
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.240
Even Uncle Myung Soo comes here for the holidays.

338
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.340
Always.

339
00:17:29.109 --> 00:17:31.409
Since this family owns Haesung Group,

340
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.220
should everything revolve around this family?

341
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.419
And should Mother always have the final decision?

342
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.530
Mother is Haesung Group's eldest daughter.

343
00:17:46.659 --> 00:17:49.300
Father earned much more by marrying Mother.

344
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.970
Mother is the eldest child of Haesung Group's leader.

345
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.270
So she is expected to play the role of a son.

346
00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.310
To gain a lot, you must pay a big price.

347
00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.740
To rich people, family matters are business too.

348
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.050
In this world, nothing is given without a cost.

349
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.550
Don't forget that.

350
00:18:21.459 --> 00:18:22.530
Honey.

351
00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:27.230
Please send someone good for Hee.

352
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.639
You made a mistake...

353
00:18:30.199 --> 00:18:31.970
and sent her to a bad man,

354
00:18:32.939 --> 00:18:35.209
so shouldn't you send her a good man now?

355
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.840
Stop it, Dad.

356
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.050
Not all men are bad, you know?

357
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.520
Of course. There are more good men.

358
00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:44.090
I won't get remarried.

359
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.919
You're almost 40 now.

360
00:18:47.619 --> 00:18:48.959
Will you live alone for the rest of your life?

361
00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:51.260
Yes. I am going to live alone.

362
00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:54.629
How many times must I say it? I won't get wed.

363
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.070
Don't you tell me that ever again.

364
00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:01.340
You too, Hyuk.

365
00:19:01.369 --> 00:19:04.109
We're not asking you to get remarried right now.

366
00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:05.109
Hyuk,

367
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.209
am I a burden to you?

368
00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:09.609
All right. Then we should live separately.

369
00:19:09.879 --> 00:19:11.679
I can leave tomorrow.

370
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.050
I just want you to be happy.

371
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:24.359
I know.

372
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.659
I understand too.

373
00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:30.800
I won't say it again until you change your mind.

374
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.139
Please stop Dad too.

375
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.470
You heard her.

376
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:41.780
I won't.

377
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.679
I won't say it.

378
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.609
I really won't.

379
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.580
You must be hungry.

380
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.490
Let's eat here and drink tea at the cafe.

381
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.159
This is quite nice.

382
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.830
Did she raise her children well too?

383
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.849
Have some hotteok.

384
00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:32.590
How dare you seduce my daughter?

385
00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:36.560
I told you to stay away. You should've listened.

386
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.169
How dare you!

387
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.480
Why is she with her family for Chuseok?

388
00:20:53.449 --> 00:20:55.320
I heard her husband was the eldest son.

389
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:25.580
Oh, my darling.

390
00:21:37.389 --> 00:21:40.389
Honey, nobody reported for a missing child...

391
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.970
Honey, isn't she just like her?

392
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.399
You thought she was Ji Soo too, didn't you?

393
00:21:47.399 --> 00:21:49.970
Why did you cut her hair like that?

394
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.109
You said nobody reported a missing child.

395
00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:55.540
See? Her parents abandoned her.

396
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.409
All right.

397
00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:02.220
Look. She looks just like Ji Soo.

398
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.990
They won't recognize her at the airport.

399
00:22:09.689 --> 00:22:10.830
Tae Soo.

400
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.090
Yes. Ji An.

401
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.030
Why didn't you stop her, Mother?

402
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:22.099
Can't you just let her do what she wants?

403
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.470
You saw her every time you came here.

404
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.909
While staying here...

405
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:27.939
for two months after Ji Soo died,

406
00:22:27.939 --> 00:22:31.149
Mi Jung has been out of her mind.

407
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:35.780
Her real parents might look for her later.

408
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.020
They wouldn't have left her there if they cared.

409
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.720
They left her there to die.

410
00:22:40.189 --> 00:22:41.959
She doesn't even know her own name.

411
00:22:41.959 --> 00:22:43.790
She just babbles "Seok".

412
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.899
She is a child...

413
00:22:51.429 --> 00:22:53.629
that our dear Ji Soo has sent for us.

414
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.970
All night, she wouldn't wake up even once...

415
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.740
and slept right next to me.

416
00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.369
She wouldn't cry either.

417
00:23:00.139 --> 00:23:02.709
You have to go to Dubai...

418
00:23:02.709 --> 00:23:04.449
just the day after tomorrow.

419
00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:06.310
How could you leave her in that state?

420
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.149
I think that child will make her herself again.

421
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.689
Consider this as a favor for her,

422
00:23:11.689 --> 00:23:14.389
and please take in the child. I beg you.

423
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.099
Father.

424
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:27.970
Mother.

425
00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.970
I am sorry.

426
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.869
It's Chuseok,

427
00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.349
but I stopped your grandchildren from coming.

428
00:23:52.129 --> 00:23:54.830
I miss you so much today, Mom.

429
00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.109
Mom, you just wait and see.

430
00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.609
I am going to earn a lot of money...

431
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.580
and bring Ji An back, okay?

432
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.020
What else would I do?

433
00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:23.159
Of course,

434
00:24:23.689 --> 00:24:25.459
I'll be very sorry to their family.

435
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.330
Mom.

436
00:24:32.099 --> 00:24:34.500
What should I do?

437
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.840
Our dear Ji Tae, Ji An,

438
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.939
Ji Soo, and Ji Ho.

439
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.119
Dad. Mom.

440
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.659
Could you please ask to give me some more time?

441
00:24:58.629 --> 00:25:00.159
Please tell him...

442
00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.459
to cut me some slack.

443
00:25:03.459 --> 00:25:05.300
Help me try to earn more money.

444
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.099
Please talk to him, would you?

445
00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:11.070
Talk to the man up there.

446
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.369
Please talk to him for me.

447
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.919
Ji Soo.

448
00:25:30.419 --> 00:25:31.760
How have you been?

449
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.760
Daddy is here.

450
00:25:44.869 --> 00:25:47.340
I am trying to adjust to the life here.

451
00:25:48.609 --> 00:25:50.649
I miss you so much,

452
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.280
but I am going to stay away for a while.

453
00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.379
I will visit you...

454
00:25:55.379 --> 00:25:56.750
when I get used to this life.

455
00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.810
Ta-da.

456
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.750
Last year, you said you'd eat it while working late.

457
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.550
Who did you say it was for this time?

458
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.260
I said I'm giving it to my ex-colleague...

459
00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:36.220
from my military service who lives alone.

460
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.060
What will you say next year?

461
00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.399
Who says I'm going to do this again next year?

462
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.500
That might really come true.

463
00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:47.599
There's no tomorrow for us.

464
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.540
That's why we get along so well.

465
00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:52.139
You're right about that.

466
00:26:52.709 --> 00:26:53.709
Eat.

467
00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.320
I don't mind living alone.

468
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.750
But holidays are tough.

469
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.849
When my roommate goes to her hometown,

470
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.060
I miss my dad, mom,

471
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.959
and even my troublesome brother.

472
00:27:13.129 --> 00:27:14.399
That's why...

473
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.929
I make all kinds of excuses every holiday...

474
00:27:16.929 --> 00:27:18.470
to bring food for you.

475
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.470
I meant, it was like that until I met you.

476
00:27:45.959 --> 00:27:47.129
Honey.

477
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:48.629
You're here.

478
00:27:49.199 --> 00:27:51.230
Sit down. You're here early today.

479
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.669
I bought some drinks.

480
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:54.500
I'll use the ladies' room.

481
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.500
Okay.

482
00:29:20.349 --> 00:29:21.820
Hey, Ji Tae.

483
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.629
Are you taking a trip down the memory lane?

484
00:29:33.629 --> 00:29:36.300
- You embarrass me. - You're home.

485
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.109
Take this for me. It's heavy.

486
00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:39.169
Give it to me.

487
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.639
Here.

488
00:29:42.639 --> 00:29:44.209
It reminded me of old memories.

489
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.849
I guess even young people have memories.

490
00:29:49.649 --> 00:29:51.520
I am not young anymore. I am 33.

491
00:29:51.849 --> 00:29:53.389
How is a 33-year-old not young?

492
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:55.560
Does that mean I'm a grandpa since I'm over 60?

493
00:29:55.889 --> 00:29:57.159
That's not what I meant.

494
00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.530
If you think you're not young,

495
00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.359
why don't you think about getting married?

496
00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:04.300
You should think about starting a family.

497
00:30:04.599 --> 00:30:07.439
I told you that I don't have plans to get married.

498
00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:08.939
But why don't you want to get married?

499
00:30:09.869 --> 00:30:11.609
There's no such reason.

502
00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:24.590
- You're back. - Yes.

503
00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.020
Come here, and have a seat.

504
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.159

Why don't we talk in our room?

507
00:30:36.199 --> 00:30:37.629
I want to discuss about Ji Ho.

508
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.929
What about Ji Ho?

509
00:30:40.899 --> 00:30:43.399
- You're back, Dad. - Yes.

510
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.810
Ji Ho,

511
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:47.939
move into the dorm.

512
00:30:48.109 --> 00:30:50.179
I will pay for it.

513
00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:55.149
Thank you, Dad.

514
00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.320

Yes, I should go pack now.

Thank you, Dad.

521
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.970
Why would you make Ji Ho move out?

522
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:18.470
You said you are going to run a shop.

Gosh, it's so comfortable, isn't it?

It'll be okay, Mom.

Madam Yoon of Seoyi Gallery said...

she got a few new paintings and sculptures.

544
00:32:40.449 --> 00:32:43.959
So I invited some wives of the executives.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.959
And I invited Chairman Jin of Jaeneung Foundation.

Aren't you being too hasty?

547

Mr. Jang's daughter will meet Do Kyung this winter,

to play golf with my father.

569

By the way, you can't say this to other people.

I don't understand why you're saying that then.

you can start with the bio-industry or such.

Ha Jung.

605
00:35:47.709 --> 00:35:50.879
Do you think we'd make a decision...

606
00:35:50.879 --> 00:35:53.280
without checking the contents of the proposal?

607
00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:56.149
Then tell me why.

608
00:35:56.249 --> 00:35:57.649
The biggest reason would be money.

609
00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.789
Ha Jung, your proposal requires press releases,

610
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.959
casting 50 singers with high performance fee,

611
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:07.959
open air concerts, and a firework festival.

612
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.859
It goes over the budget.

613
00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:12.070
And think about "Retro Foods".

614
00:36:12.269 --> 00:36:14.269
Experiencing snacks around the world?

615
00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:16.439
It's like putting the cart before the horse.

616
00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:20.309
Ji An suggested to cast college student singers...

617
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:22.809
and give them a chance to sing in front of people.

618
00:36:22.809 --> 00:36:24.280
At the same time,

619
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.079
they'll make people recall the good old days.

620
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.519
That was brilliant.

621
00:36:29.519 --> 00:36:32.050
Your proposal is not much different from Ji An's.

622
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.890
Ji An has various ideas for experience events...

623
00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.829
such as a fashion show, a hand printing contest,

624
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:39.590
a natural dyeing event, and even a free market.

625
00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.100
So we've come up with a conclusion...

626
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.700
in a fair and democratic voting process.

627
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.570
Ji An, you should do this right.

628
00:36:51.039 --> 00:36:53.169
This event is for our 40th anniversary.

629
00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:55.079
Okay.

630
00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:57.109
I'll make it work out well.

631
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:12.660
Ji An.

632
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.399
Congratulations. You must be happy.

633
00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.970
Thanks.

634
00:37:18.629 --> 00:37:20.600
I'm really happy about this.

635
00:37:21.499 --> 00:37:22.840
How do you feel? Are you upset?

636
00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:27.140
Not really. I was just afraid I'd be busy.

637
00:37:27.379 --> 00:37:30.479
I felt sorry for you, so I just tried to be nice.

638
00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:32.879
Did you?

639
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:34.879
I'm serious.

640
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.350
If I didn't, you would've been overloaded...

641
00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:39.519
with too much work.

642
00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.490
Too much work? What work?

643
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.289
Now, since the FNB team has been separated,

644
00:37:43.289 --> 00:37:45.059
you should separate the marketing data.

645
00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:47.229
Separate the data from the past 10 years,

646
00:37:47.229 --> 00:37:49.499
and send me the data for Haesung Apparel.

647
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.169
The past 10 years?

648
00:37:52.169 --> 00:37:54.499
You should go now. It's in the data room.

649
00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.600
Do you want me to do it now?

650
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.539
That's what I did. So it's your job now.

651
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:03.010
That was the rookie's job.

652
00:38:06.649 --> 00:38:08.220
Okay, I will.

653
00:38:10.249 --> 00:38:11.419
Are you smiling at me?

654
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:12.919
Why?

655
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.559
I just realized...

656
00:38:16.289 --> 00:38:18.760
what is going on.

657
00:38:19.729 --> 00:38:20.859
What do you mean?

658
00:38:20.959 --> 00:38:23.260
I'm not offended to whatever you say.

659
00:38:23.499 --> 00:38:27.030
I can just do my work without being deflated.

660
00:38:28.269 --> 00:38:29.800
It feels like I'm just letting you off.

661
00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:32.609
So this is how it feels.

662
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.439
You're just letting me off?

663
00:38:35.939 --> 00:38:39.550
Hey, you have nothing. You're not letting me off!

667
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.450
She's the wife of the chairman of New World.

668
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.890
And she's the wife of the head of State Affairs.

669
00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:21.689
I've heard so much about you.

670
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:23.519
I'm Son Mi Na.

671
00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:25.959
Nice to meet you. I'm Han Go Eun.

672
00:39:26.129 --> 00:39:27.959
I've always wanted to meet you.

673
00:39:28.059 --> 00:39:30.669
We'll get related by marriage someday.

674
00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:33.829
So President No's daughter will...

675
00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.499
Yes. With my second son.

676
00:39:39.269 --> 00:39:42.280
Madam Yoon said she got new valuable artworks.

677
00:39:42.479 --> 00:39:46.550
I invited you two to show you the artworks first.

678
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.919
Is that it? Egon Schiele.

679
00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.249
I like pop art these days.

680
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.789
Madam Yoon should be here to explain the artwork.

681
00:39:55.789 --> 00:39:57.189
Why is she late?

682
00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.859
- Give her a call now. - Okay.

683
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.430
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

684
00:40:03.129 --> 00:40:04.700
Madam Hong.

685
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:07.570
I didn't know you were coming.

686
00:40:07.669 --> 00:40:11.769
I heard Seoyi Gallery took some good artworks first.

687
00:40:11.939 --> 00:40:13.240
So I came here to see them.

688
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:17.280
And I wanted to meet someone here.

689
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:20.749
Hello, ma'am.

690
00:40:30.289 --> 00:40:33.090
Madam Yoon, why did you bring her?

691
00:40:33.329 --> 00:40:35.100
She just dropped in without calling me.

692
00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:38.629
I didn't have an excuse to make her leave.

693
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:53.749
All right.

694
00:41:00.419 --> 00:41:02.320
Year 2010.

695
00:41:10.229 --> 00:41:12.229
Oh no, this is very expensive.

696
00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:21.240
Ms. No, I love paintings too.

697
00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.979
Please call me when you have something good.

698
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:25.249
Of course.

699
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.490
My husband wants to have dinner...

700
00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:35.459
with your couple before your daughter comes home.

701
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:41.459
Is it because things are going well? You look good.

702
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.459
Do I?

703
00:41:44.229 --> 00:41:46.100
She looks good because she found her daughter.

704
00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:52.939
What do you mean...

705
00:41:52.939 --> 00:41:54.709
by saying that she found her daughter?

706
00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.879
You know her big daughter had disappeared, right?

707
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.350
They got her back.

708
00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.649
I was waiting to see...

709
00:42:06.649 --> 00:42:08.919
when she'd share the good news,

710
00:42:08.919 --> 00:42:10.260
but I heard nothing.

711
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.329
Why and how.

712
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.260
Did she grow up well?

713
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.840
How did you find out?

714
00:42:23.269 --> 00:42:24.470
Ms. No,

715
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.769
do you think so little of me?

716
00:42:27.379 --> 00:42:30.609
You can't ask me to reveal my source.

717
00:42:30.609 --> 00:42:31.780
You know better.

718
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.249
My goodness. Then you really did find her.

719
00:42:39.789 --> 00:42:41.859
Yes, I did.

720
00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:44.990
You'll hear about it soon enough.

721
00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:47.300
Please give me some more time.

722
00:42:48.059 --> 00:42:49.059
This is...

723
00:42:50.669 --> 00:42:52.129
a bit perplexing.

724
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:54.669
You'll see for yourself later,

725
00:42:54.669 --> 00:42:56.269
but she grew up well.

726
00:42:56.269 --> 00:42:58.709
I'm sure you have a plan that involves the company.

727
00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.140
I understand that.

728
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.479
But we can't just accept that.

729
00:43:02.539 --> 00:43:04.780
We could possibly become in-laws.

730
00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.350
This could be a disaster.

731
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.820
What if she blows up like a landmine?

732
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.890
Am I wrong?

733
00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:12.490
That wouldn't happen.

734
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.990
Ms. No, introduce your daughter to us.

735
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:24.100
Very well.

736
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.399
I'll arrange something very soon. However...

737
00:43:27.399 --> 00:43:29.600
Don't worry too much, Ms. No.

738
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:31.669
Whatever state she's in,

739
00:43:31.669 --> 00:43:34.079
we're willing to wait until...

740
00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:36.780
you train her enough to make the announcement.

741
00:43:38.609 --> 00:43:40.109
Madam Hong.

742
00:43:40.249 --> 00:43:42.149
You're very wrong.

743
00:43:42.149 --> 00:43:43.850
She's family.

744
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:46.550
She wasn't raised by a rich family,

745
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.559
but she studied business at Hyorim University...

746
00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:51.189
and was already working at Haesung.

747
00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:53.160
She works at Haesung?

748
00:43:53.559 --> 00:43:56.829
Yes. That made me realize...

749
00:43:56.829 --> 00:44:00.169
that blood has a way of bringing you together.

750
00:44:00.169 --> 00:44:02.700
Then you can introduce her to us today.

751
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.240
Why wait until some other day?

752
00:44:06.539 --> 00:44:07.840
Today?

753
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.950
Yes, Ms. No. If you'd do that for us,

754
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:14.019
we could all go home feeling assured.

755
00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.439
(Mother)

756
00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.709
Hello.

757
00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:39.809
Are you off work?

758
00:44:39.809 --> 00:44:41.410
No, I'm still at work.

759
00:44:41.709 --> 00:44:43.180
You should get off soon.

760
00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.709
Come to Seoyi Gallery's VIP room.

761
00:44:47.479 --> 00:44:49.280
There are some people you must meet.

762
00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:50.720
Right now?

763
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.820
I'm working...

764
00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.859
in the archive room now.

765
00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:56.660
It's so dusty that...

766
00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.930
my clothes and hair are a mess.

767
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.459
You have one hour.

768
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.970
That's barely enough time to change.

769
00:45:07.129 --> 00:45:08.669
Okay, then.

770
00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:10.669
See you in an hour.

771
00:45:17.079 --> 00:45:19.280
Why did she pretend not to hear me?

772
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.680
Oh, no. What should I do?

773
00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.550
(Space Marketing Strategy)

774
00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.959
Put these in the vice president's office...

775
00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:33.490
and those in the cabinet for my successor.

776
00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.600
Okay.

777
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.370
(Younger sister)

778
00:45:39.499 --> 00:45:40.700
Hi, it's me.

779
00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.939
Do Kyung, Mom just called.

780
00:45:42.939 --> 00:45:45.709
I have an hour to get to Seoyi Gallery's VIP room.

781
00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:47.240
She says there are some people I should meet.

782
00:45:47.439 --> 00:45:49.439
"Seoyi Gallery's VIP room"?

783
00:45:49.439 --> 00:45:50.439
"To meet some people"?

784
00:45:50.749 --> 00:45:52.209
But while I was working...

785
00:45:52.209 --> 00:45:54.479
in the archive room, I tore my clothes,

786
00:45:54.479 --> 00:45:56.379
and I'm all dusty. What should I do?

787
00:45:56.519 --> 00:45:58.720
Did you tell Mom you're a mess?

788
00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.490
I told her all that,

789
00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:02.820
but she gave me an hour and just hung up.

790
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.590
What? Go wash your face.

791
00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:07.829
I'll call you back. Hurry up.

792
00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:10.229
Is something wrong?

793
00:46:10.229 --> 00:46:11.399
We got found out.

794
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.370
Who leaked the news?

795
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:15.570
One hour?

796
00:46:16.439 --> 00:46:18.309
Call a taxi and a van.

797
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:19.439
Okay.

798
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.579
(Gi Jae)

799
00:46:24.209 --> 00:46:26.579
Gi Jae, tell your personal shopper...

800
00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:29.079
to bring some size 44 clothes...

801
00:46:29.079 --> 00:46:31.649
for a 170cm woman to the back of your building.

802
00:46:31.649 --> 00:46:32.649
It's an emergency.

803
00:46:32.649 --> 00:46:33.649
What's wrong?

804
00:46:33.649 --> 00:46:35.359
You have your own shopper.

805
00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:36.390
There's a problem.

806
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:37.660
She's a working woman.

807
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.760
She can't look too flashy or too simple.

808
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.800
And...

809
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:53.979
Hello.

810
00:46:53.979 --> 00:46:55.039
Come out to the back.

811
00:46:55.039 --> 00:46:56.280
You'll find a taxi.

812
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.979
Get out wherever it drops you off.

813
00:46:57.979 --> 00:46:59.809
Are you kidding me?

814
00:46:59.809 --> 00:47:03.050
It's an emergency. I'm not kidding, so run.

815
00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.350
Okay.

816
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.379
Get in.

817
00:47:36.519 --> 00:47:38.249
What is this van?

818
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:40.519
I think you got found out.

819
00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:42.390
How?

820
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.059
I don't know that yet.

821
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:46.689
She gave you an hour to get to Seoyi Gallery.

822
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.300
That means she's with people she can't avoid.

823
00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:51.070
With whom?

824
00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.100
Secretary Yoo, call to see if they're ready.

825
00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.100
Okay.

826
00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.970
Who are those people?

827
00:47:57.269 --> 00:47:59.740
I can't go there looking like this.

828
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:01.539
I won't let that happen.

829
00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.840
No, wait. That's not the problem.

830
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.450
I can't just show up so suddenly like this.

831
00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.079
What if I mess up?

832
00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:09.350
You can do this.

833
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:11.519
You did it in Yangpyeong.

834
00:48:11.789 --> 00:48:14.090
You suddenly showed up and didn't tremble at all.

835
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:16.890
That was a very different situation from this.

836
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:20.059
I don't want to go unprepared.

837
00:48:20.059 --> 00:48:21.859
You can't refuse because you don't want to.

838
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.729
This is very important.

839
00:48:24.899 --> 00:48:26.970
You can't do this to me.

840
00:48:27.669 --> 00:48:29.899
If Mom can't avoid the situation,

841
00:48:30.039 --> 00:48:32.039
they must be really important people.

842
00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:35.180
What should I say if they ask me any questions?

843
00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.609
Say whatever you want.

844
00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:37.709
What?

845
00:48:37.709 --> 00:48:39.709
Say whatever you want,

846
00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:41.180
and it will be the right answer.

847
00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.490
How is your son?

848
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:50.220
He's very well.

849
00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.660
He's a cunning boy.

850
00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.459
He's so cheeky too.

851
00:48:53.459 --> 00:48:55.930
He's such a good-looking young man.

852
00:48:56.059 --> 00:48:58.800
I hope Eun Seok called Do Kyung.

853
00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.499
What if she just shows up?

854
00:49:01.769 --> 00:49:03.840
You and your son...

855
00:49:13.149 --> 00:49:14.320
Don't overdo it.

856
00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.249
It's been 10 hours since she put on her makeup.

857
00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:19.649
It has to look like it's naturally smudged.

858
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.419
Understood, sir.

859
00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:38.140
Here you go.

860
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.289
- Wear these. - Okay.

861
00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.100
This too.

862
00:50:19.809 --> 00:50:21.120
These shoes are too small.

863
00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:35.959
Good. A successful transformation.

864
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:38.970
Let's go.

865
00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.340
Call Mom now.

866
00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.579
She'll be worried that I'll look like a mess.

867
00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:51.280
Not when there are people watching.

868
00:50:51.649 --> 00:50:52.950
What do you mean?

869
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:54.550
This is like a game.

870
00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:56.780
If Mom gets a text or call, she loses.

871
00:50:57.850 --> 00:50:59.950
You have to just show up...

872
00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:01.320
without prior announcement.

873
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.559
This life isn't that easy either.

874
00:51:06.559 --> 00:51:07.899
Seoyi Gallery's Madam Yoon...

875
00:51:07.899 --> 00:51:09.300
and Mom go way back.

876
00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.700
They collect artworks.

877
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.100
When a rare piece comes in,

878
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.100
a small group gathers to look at it and chat.

879
00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.439
Then she's just with some friends.

880
00:51:18.439 --> 00:51:20.070
They exchange information,

881
00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.609
meet new people, and make new connections.

882
00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:25.180
They meet each other because of such needs.

883
00:51:26.879 --> 00:51:30.019
Mr. Jang's wife would probably be there.

884
00:51:30.749 --> 00:51:33.749
And the chair of the board of Jaeneung Foundation.

885
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:35.820
Mom funds them.

886
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.490
Ms. Jin offers moral support in return.

887
00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:41.430
Madam Yoon will be there, of course.

888
00:51:41.959 --> 00:51:44.700
The person who'd force Mom into calling you over...

889
00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:48.740
Madam Han, Seo Hyun's future mother-in-law?

890
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:51.410
I think that's everyone,

891
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.609
but I can't think of anyone else.

892
00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.410
There's more than that?

893
00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:59.780
None of those people would threaten Mom like this.

894
00:52:00.749 --> 00:52:03.780
Someone who knows you and wants to see you now.

895
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.300
You're on your own from here.

896
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.669
Go on. You have seven minutes.

897
00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:28.410
What if I mess up and cause Mom...

898
00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:31.749
I mean, our whole family a lot of trouble?

899
00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.620
That won't happen. You won't mess up.

900
00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:37.550
Do Kyung.

901
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.749
Now, repeat after me.

902
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.160
I am Choi Eun Seok.

903
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.229
Gosh, do you think I don't know that?

904
00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:47.329
Say it.

905
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:50.300
I am Choi Eun Seok.

906
00:52:51.729 --> 00:52:56.100
- I am Choi Eun Seok. - I am not Seo Ji An.

907
00:52:59.269 --> 00:53:00.410
Say it now.

908
00:53:03.539 --> 00:53:05.350
- I am... - Look at me.

909
00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:08.120
- What? - Look into my eyes.

910
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.390
I am not Seo Ji An.

911
00:53:15.019 --> 00:53:16.220
I am...

912
00:53:17.729 --> 00:53:18.890
I am...

913
00:53:21.129 --> 00:53:24.169
- not Seo Ji An. - Who are you?

914
00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:27.840
Choi... Eun Seok.

915
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.200
Again.

916
00:53:29.669 --> 00:53:31.570
You are Choi Do Kyung's sister. Who are you?

917
00:53:32.209 --> 00:53:34.039
Choi Eun Seok.

918
00:53:34.039 --> 00:53:36.640
The daughter of Choi Jae Sung. Who?

919
00:53:36.879 --> 00:53:37.879
Choi Eun Seok.

920
00:53:37.879 --> 00:53:40.280
The daughter of No Myung Hee. Who?

921
00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.879
- Choi Eun Seok. - You are...

922
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:44.120
whom?

923
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:46.249
Choi Eun Seok.

924
00:53:47.019 --> 00:53:48.120
Okay.

925
00:53:48.919 --> 00:53:51.329
Good. 30 minutes.

926
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:53.430
Hang in there for just 30 minutes.

927
00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:01.100
I like that too.

928
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:03.800
Pick just one today.

929
00:54:04.209 --> 00:54:07.309
You can't stop once you start collecting art.

930
00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.680
Ms. No, it looks like she won't show up.

931
00:54:13.209 --> 00:54:16.079
Ms. Jin, can't you even tell the time?

932
00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.350
We still have five minutes left.

933
00:54:24.359 --> 00:54:25.859
A guest has arrived.

934
00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:51.149
Excuse me for interrupting your meeting.

935
00:54:51.519 --> 00:54:53.749
I came here because Mother called.

936
00:54:54.189 --> 00:54:55.760
I'm Choi Eun Seok.

937
00:54:58.629 --> 00:54:59.689
Hello.

938
00:55:00.359 --> 00:55:02.499
They're viewing some artworks.

939
00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:05.300
- Wait for us outside. - Sure.

940
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.600
That would be rude after telling her to come here.

941
00:55:09.499 --> 00:55:11.240
We can introduce ourselves later.

942
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:13.709
Are you interested in art?

943
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.309
Yes.

944
00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:18.479
Then join us.

945
00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.410
Thank you.

946
00:55:22.749 --> 00:55:25.620
Oh, this is Min Bok Jin's work.

947
00:55:26.249 --> 00:55:27.660
Do you know him?

948
00:55:28.019 --> 00:55:29.789
He's such a famous artist.

949
00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:32.559
Prints of this sculpture are everywhere.

950
00:55:33.129 --> 00:55:34.530
Yes, but...

951
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:37.870
my favorite out of all his work is "Love".

952
00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.499
I see your mom taught you art first.

953
00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.510
If you could buy just one, which would you choose?

954
00:55:50.439 --> 00:55:53.510
That one, by Lee Yong Sool.

955
00:55:54.379 --> 00:55:56.120
Do you know him too?

956
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:58.390
He's not that famous.

957
00:55:59.149 --> 00:56:02.289
He has a consistently unique style.

958
00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:05.129
I thought it was a photo and was surprised...

959
00:56:05.129 --> 00:56:06.660
by the three-dimensional effect.

960
00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:09.260
An actual photo of a bowl,

961
00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:12.430
and a painting that creates an illusion.

962
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.340
Out of those two,

963
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:17.410
which is closer to the actual image of the bowl?

964
00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:20.740
It's a unique way of portraying...

965
00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:21.979
one's own illusions.

966
00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.479
Did you study art?

967
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:27.079
No, I studied business.

968
00:56:38.629 --> 00:56:40.229
Has it not been 30 minutes yet?

969
00:56:40.899 --> 00:56:42.430
When did she go inside?

970
00:56:44.269 --> 00:56:46.100
Wait just five more minutes.

971
00:56:46.729 --> 00:56:48.039
That's enough.

972
00:56:48.269 --> 00:56:49.740
I should go inside now.

973
00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:54.079
You can head home. I'll bring the van to work.

974
00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:56.879
Yes, sir.

975
00:56:58.109 --> 00:57:00.979
Egon Schiele drew many self-portraits.

976
00:57:00.979 --> 00:57:02.620
And he had complex relationships.

977
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:04.749
He even left a long-term lover...

978
00:57:04.749 --> 00:57:06.519
for someone with a better background.

979
00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:10.419
They both studied under Klimt, so their works...

980
00:57:10.519 --> 00:57:12.490
look similar to "Life and Death",

981
00:57:12.689 --> 00:57:15.129
but I prefer Kokoschka's "Bride of the Wind".

982
00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:17.030
It was more touching.

983
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.800
He loved only one woman, Alma.

984
00:57:21.269 --> 00:57:24.740
He suffered in the end as he couldn't have her,

985
00:57:25.539 --> 00:57:27.209
but I think that love...

986
00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:30.280
isn't about not changing. It is something eternal.

987
00:57:30.609 --> 00:57:32.709
Do you know who Alma is?

988
00:57:32.979 --> 00:57:35.280
I believe she was married to Gustav Mahler.

989
00:57:35.479 --> 00:57:38.689
Though she remarried a few times after his death.

990
00:57:40.959 --> 00:57:42.019
Seo Hyun.

991
00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:44.189
I know you like Mahler,

992
00:57:44.189 --> 00:57:46.959
but number three's too long. I'm not Alma.

993
00:57:46.959 --> 00:57:48.600
Number two, Resurrection.

994
00:57:50.629 --> 00:57:53.470
You know very much about art.

995
00:57:54.269 --> 00:57:57.140
But I don't know much of pop or installation art.

996
00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:01.240
Ms. No, you should send her to art school.

997
00:58:01.809 --> 00:58:05.180
I might consider that. I'm shocked myself.

998
00:58:09.249 --> 00:58:10.720
Gosh, Mr. Choi.

999
00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:14.320
It's good to see you.

1000
00:58:15.019 --> 00:58:16.990
Sorry for the intrusion.

1001
00:58:17.689 --> 00:58:19.890
What are you doing here?

1002
00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:23.030
The chairman wanted to have dinner with Eun Seok.

1003
00:58:23.129 --> 00:58:25.970
She said she'd be here, so I came to get her.

1004
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:29.370
Did we keep you from a family dinner?

1005
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.240
I feel so sorry now.

1006
00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.109
I called her over...

1007
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.379
so Madam Son and Madam Han could meet her.

1008
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:42.850
I'm sure my father will understand.

1009
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:46.490
I apologize, Ms. No.

1010
00:58:48.689 --> 00:58:50.090
Sorry, Mr. Choi.

1011
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:53.789
Now, he is the vice president.

1012
00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:57.570
He got promoted already?

1013
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.870
By the chairman's orders.

1014
00:59:21.959 --> 00:59:23.019
Eun Seok.

1015
00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.100
My dear daughter. I'm so proud of you.

1016
00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:32.399
Mom, why did you follow us?

1017
00:59:32.399 --> 00:59:34.399
To find out what happened.

1018
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:37.140
Are you wearing Cinderella's shoes?

1019
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.470
How did you change in just one hour?

1020
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:41.840
Do Kyung helped me out.

1021
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:44.450
I know he did.

1022
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:46.309
Of all the things you did,

1023
00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:49.220
calling him was the best you did.

1024
00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.490
See you at home. I won't be long.

1025
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:57.990
I need to sort out those women.

1026
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.579
I think I'm about to die.

1027
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:19.079
I was so nervous that my neck has gone stiff.

1028
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:21.919
Gosh, I need some fresh air.

1029
01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.789
It felt as if the air in the room was thinning.

1030
01:00:26.149 --> 01:00:28.660
Did it? I couldn't tell at all.

1031
01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:30.959
Well done, Choi Eun Seok.

1032
01:00:32.059 --> 01:00:33.329
Then buy me some beer.

1033
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.329
Buy me some beer.

1034
01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:38.729
Mom will be home soon. Don't drink just yet.

1035
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:41.939
A can of beer is like soda to me.

1036
01:00:43.169 --> 01:00:46.709
Beer, beer, beer.

1037
01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:51.249
Let's go to the bar of our hotel on the way.

1038
01:00:51.579 --> 01:00:52.979
I don't like enclosed spaces.

1039
01:00:54.519 --> 01:00:55.720
Let's go to my hangout.

1040
01:00:55.979 --> 01:00:57.450
You have a hangout?

1041
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:07.629
Do your feet hurt much?

1042
01:01:07.859 --> 01:01:09.899
They're just a bit achy.

1043
01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.870
I'm sorry for not asking your shoe size before,

1044
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.140
but must you do that in public?

1045
01:01:16.499 --> 01:01:18.709
I'm afraid someone might see us.

1046
01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.510
I feel so alive now.

1047
01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:27.010
What's that scar on your foot?

1048
01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.550
Oh, this?

1049
01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.350
I got stitches when I was a kid.

1050
01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.120
How bad was it to still have a scar?

1051
01:01:35.189 --> 01:01:37.430
Stop staring. I feel embarrassed.

1052
01:01:39.859 --> 01:01:43.200
But why didn't you tell us you knew about Alma?

1053
01:01:44.229 --> 01:01:46.430
I only know that Mahler was a composer,

1054
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:47.999
but I don't know anything about music.

1055
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.340
But I do know...

1056
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.870
that Mahler's wife is Alma.

1057
01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:53.740
What's the point of saying that?

1058
01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.539
The look on your face said that back then.

1059
01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:56.910
How was I?

1060
01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:00.550
"I'll kill you with my face."

1061
01:02:00.879 --> 01:02:02.979
You were as cold as 30 degrees below zero.

1062
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:06.249
I admit that I can be very scary.

1063
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.559
I should be very careful to avoid that.

1064
01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.359
I noticed you know quite a lot about paintings.

1065
01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:14.530
I wanted to go study arts.

1066
01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.959
Really?

1067
01:02:15.959 --> 01:02:18.229
Did you want to become a painter?

1068
01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:19.370
A sculptor.

1069
01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.870
I wanted to be a sculptor like...

1070
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:24.870
Niki de Saint Phalle who made...

1071
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:27.979
Camille Claudel schemed by Rodin look petty.

1072
01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:30.240
Why did you study business instead of fine arts then?

1073
01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:37.079
I'm sorry. You probably had your reasons.

1074
01:02:37.079 --> 01:02:38.189
It's fine.

1075
01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:41.490
What about you? What was your dream?

1076
01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:44.559
- Dream? - Your childhood dream.

1077
01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:45.890
What did you write...

1078
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:47.829
for your dream when you were a student?

1079
01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:52.329
President. President. Chairman.

1080
01:02:52.329 --> 01:02:53.970
President? Chairman?

1081
01:02:55.499 --> 01:02:57.039
That... That was your dream?

1082
01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.340
Of course.

1083
01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:00.470
I'm the only son of Haesung Corporation.

1084
01:03:03.209 --> 01:03:04.510
It must've been hard.

1085
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:06.050
What?

1086
01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.320
I said that it must've been hard.

1087
01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.649
What is? What's there to be hard?

1088
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.649
Your path was determined since you were young.

1089
01:03:13.649 --> 01:03:15.160
It was already determined.

1090
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:19.789
I thought you led a life...

1091
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:21.530
where you had everything you wanted.

1092
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:25.999
I feel sorry for you too.

1093
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:27.769
Hey.

1094
01:03:27.769 --> 01:03:30.039
I'm going to be the leader of Haesung Corporation.

1095
01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.370
Whatever.

1096
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:34.079
You missed the chance...

1097
01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.180
to find out what kind of person you really are...

1098
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.180
if you couldn't even dream of anything else.

1099
01:03:42.479 --> 01:03:44.850
Why didn't you dream if that was already granted?

1100
01:03:45.019 --> 01:03:46.890
Dreaming things like that makes you happy.

1101
01:03:49.189 --> 01:03:52.829
Drinking time is up. Let's go. I'm hungry.

1102
01:03:53.559 --> 01:03:54.729
Okay.

1103
01:04:05.439 --> 01:04:07.209
But she's a girl.

1104
01:04:07.209 --> 01:04:09.209
You should've had plastic surgery to sew it up.

1105
01:04:09.209 --> 01:04:10.910
That's what I meant.

1106
01:04:11.379 --> 01:04:13.979
I didn't have a choice back then.

1107
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.180
Your grandmother insisted to celebrate...

1108
01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.350
her 60th birthday at home...

1109
01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:19.490
when your dad was working abroad.

1110
01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.419
I couldn't go to a large hospital...

1111
01:04:21.419 --> 01:04:23.059
in Jeongseon at night.

1112
01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:25.789
Ji An was bleeding so much.

1113
01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.329
I had no choice but to go to a nearby clinic...

1114
01:04:28.329 --> 01:04:30.669
and go to a large hospital the next day.

1115
01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:35.999
It made me so nervous that I couldn't look at it.

1116
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.769
Grandmother told me later...

1117
01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:40.510
that an old doctor who was almost 80 years old...

1118
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:43.109
sewed it up with magnifying glasses on.

1119
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:45.709
80? Magnifying glasses?

1120
01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:48.220
The coke bottle lid was so sharp.

1121
01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.189
She fell while rubbing against it.

1122
01:04:52.919 --> 01:04:55.359
How would a one-year-old's bones bare that?

1123
01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:58.329
The city hospital doctor told me...

1124
01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:01.030
that she was lucky her nerves weren't hurt...

1125
01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.160
as he put a cast on her.

1126
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.499
Mom, please. Stop.

1127
01:05:04.999 --> 01:05:06.700
Even though he was my in-law's grandson,

1128
01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.769
I hit him a few times the next day.

1129
01:05:08.999 --> 01:05:10.539
I couldn't treat her wound...

1130
01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:12.039
because of the cast.

1131
01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.209
How would a one-year-old's bones bare that?

1132
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:19.379
When I was a year old,

1133
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:21.749
it was 1991.

1134
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:24.390
Eun Seok went missing...

1135
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:27.050
in August, 1992.

1136
01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:28.289
Three years old.

1137
01:05:29.019 --> 01:05:31.859
If I hurt my foot in 1991,

1138
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:35.899
I'm...

1139
01:05:37.729 --> 01:05:39.370
can't be...

1140
01:05:40.939 --> 01:05:42.100
Choi Eun Seok.

1141
01:05:47.124 --> 01:05:52.124
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1142
01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:05.530
(My Golden Life)

1143
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:08.800
I'm now the vice president of Haesung Apparel.

1144
01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.930
How do you want that girl who stole your job?

1145
01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:12.269
You're more like my sister now.

1146
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:13.729
You fit into Haesung Corporation now.

1147
01:06:13.729 --> 01:06:14.970
When you found me,

1148
01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.539
did you have a DNA test?

1149
01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:18.140
We couldn't have found you without it.

1150
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:20.709
- Excuse me. - Are you here for Ji An?

1151
01:06:20.709 --> 01:06:22.240
Did you give 20,000 dollars to Ji An?

1152
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.680
Why do you call her Ji An?

1153
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:27.209
Why did she throw out the photos of me and Ji Soo?

1154
01:06:27.209 --> 01:06:29.579
Do you remember me when I was young?

1155
01:06:29.579 --> 01:06:30.850
Before we left for Dubai,

1156
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:32.749
you returned from Grandmother's house.

1157
01:06:32.749 --> 01:06:34.720
But Ji Soo looked different.

1158
01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:35.959
Ji Soo?
