00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:09.020
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:19.163
Who owns that white car?

3
00:00:22.093 --> 00:00:23.392
It's mine.

4
00:00:23.392 --> 00:00:24.432
What about this one?

5
00:00:24.763 --> 00:00:25.763
It's mine.

6
00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:27.203
We can go to the police station later.

7
00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:29.032
You two should get treated first.

8
00:00:29.332 --> 00:00:30.373
All right.

9
00:01:00.963 --> 00:01:01.963
Are you okay?

10
00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:09.672
I'm okay, so stop staring at me.

11
00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:10.672
Pardon?

12
00:01:12.612 --> 00:01:13.612
Okay.

13
00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:21.082
I believe in you...

14
00:01:22.552 --> 00:01:23.593
because it's me.

15
00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:25.823
That's why I trust you.

16
00:01:28.832 --> 00:01:30.162
How can you trust me?

17
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:31.933
Sorry?

18
00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:36.032
What do you mean?

19
00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:37.202
About what I said earlier.

20
00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:41.273
I told you that you and your mom will die because of Yoo Bum.

21
00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:43.572
I would never believe my words if I were you.

22
00:01:44.942 --> 00:01:46.113
I would even be furious.

23
00:01:49.412 --> 00:01:50.412
I'm not mad.

24
00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:53.382
I really believe that you saved me.

25
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:56.423
Why do you believe in me?

26
00:01:59.493 --> 00:02:00.993
I'm not saying that I lied.

27
00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:01.993
You dreamed about it, didn't you?

28
00:02:03.463 --> 00:02:05.702
And your dreams kept becoming real.

29
00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:06.863
Am I right?

30
00:02:08.403 --> 00:02:09.833
How did you know that?

31
00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:12.472
I have such dreams too.

32
00:02:13.502 --> 00:02:15.843
And my dreams always come true.

33
00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:18.143
Just like yours.

34
00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:04.352
Excuse me, are you okay?

35
00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:06.262
You're sweating so much.

36
00:03:08.593 --> 00:03:10.333
It's a little hot in here.

37
00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:12.803
Are you okay, honey?

38
00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:14.803
Yes.

39
00:03:17.972 --> 00:03:19.643
You keep having such dreams?

40
00:03:20.743 --> 00:03:22.313
Yes, and I have a lot of them.

41
00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:23.972
Was that your first time?

42
00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:25.583
Yes.

43
00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:28.643
How far can you...

44
00:03:29.183 --> 00:03:30.952
What I mean is, how far can you predict?

45
00:03:32.683 --> 00:03:34.822
I'm not asking this because I believe your words.

46
00:03:35.493 --> 00:03:36.493
There's no limit.

47
00:03:37.423 --> 00:03:40.462
It can be a month away or tomorrow.

48
00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:43.233
It can even be a few minutes later.

49
00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:45.063
Have your dreams ever been wrong?

50
00:03:46.363 --> 00:03:47.363
Never.

51
00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:50.973
There are dreams that haven't come true, but none of them were wrong.

52
00:03:50.973 --> 00:03:52.002
You've never tried to alter them?

53
00:03:54.072 --> 00:03:56.072
That's why you are amazing.

54
00:03:57.743 --> 00:03:59.382
I really did save someone?

55
00:03:59.743 --> 00:04:00.743
That's right.

56
00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:03.652
Then what's going to happen?

57
00:04:05.483 --> 00:04:08.452
I mean, it's not that I believe your words,

58
00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:12.223
but say for example that I really changed the future.

59
00:04:12.223 --> 00:04:14.392
Let's just say that I did.

60
00:04:14.892 --> 00:04:16.262
Then what's going to happen?

61
00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:20.632
I'm not sure.

62
00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:26.342
When you stop the running water, it diverts its course.

63
00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:29.813
You stopped things from happening, just like stopping the running water.

64
00:04:30.813 --> 00:04:32.613
Time will flow differently.

65
00:04:34.683 --> 00:04:36.313
Gosh, I need to lose weight.

66
00:04:36.882 --> 00:04:38.252
Why were you so late today?

67
00:04:38.313 --> 00:04:39.652
Don't even bring it up.

68
00:04:41.022 --> 00:04:42.423
I almost died.

69
00:04:43.553 --> 00:04:45.892
I might die if I don't lose weight.

70
00:04:50.132 --> 00:04:52.563
Yes, I tried to maintain the best condition for myself,

71
00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:54.002
and I practiced hard.

72
00:04:54.163 --> 00:04:56.332
Ms. Park So Yoon, you made it to the finals of...

73
00:04:56.332 --> 00:04:58.473
the International Chopin Competition for the first time as a Korean.

74
00:04:58.533 --> 00:05:00.002
Please comment on that.

75
00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:03.072
Many people rooted for me.

76
00:05:03.272 --> 00:05:05.842
I will do my best, so I wouldn't disappoint...

77
00:05:06.183 --> 00:05:07.342
- Oh, no. - What happened?

78
00:05:07.683 --> 00:05:09.113
- Mom. - Honey.

79
00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:11.483
Ma'am? Call 911 now.

80
00:05:13.183 --> 00:05:14.183
- Honey. - Mom.

81
00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:17.022
- What's happening? - What's going on?

82
00:05:17.022 --> 00:05:18.553
What is this?

83
00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:23.433
- Can you see? - Don't take photos.

84
00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:25.433
I did not do this.

85
00:05:28.163 --> 00:05:30.873
Hello? Is this the police?

86
00:05:31.173 --> 00:05:33.142
I want to report a domestic violence.

87
00:05:33.142 --> 00:05:34.642
I told you I didn't do this!

88
00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:36.142
Get out of the way.

89
00:05:36.142 --> 00:05:37.842
- Mom, please get up. - Don't take photos.

90
00:05:37.842 --> 00:05:39.283
- Hurry and come, please. - Mom.

91
00:05:41.313 --> 00:05:42.983
If time passes the other way,

92
00:05:43.483 --> 00:05:44.952
which way does it go to?

93
00:05:45.283 --> 00:05:47.382
To a better direction? Or the other way?

94
00:05:47.723 --> 00:05:49.493
I have yet to try changing how time passes.

95
00:05:49.923 --> 00:05:50.952
I don't know also.

96
00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:52.363
But what I can assure you is that...

97
00:05:53.863 --> 00:05:57.563
people don't notice that time has changed in the beginning.

98
00:05:58.293 --> 00:06:01.132
Then, as time passes by,

99
00:06:02.002 --> 00:06:04.072
the difference will get bigger.

100
00:06:04.173 --> 00:06:05.942
Do you know who I am?

101
00:06:19.783 --> 00:06:20.783
So Yoon.

102
00:06:22.392 --> 00:06:23.392
Are you all right?

103
00:06:25.423 --> 00:06:26.623
How could you come here?

104
00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:28.262
I just...

105
00:06:29.993 --> 00:06:31.692
I just dropped by.

106
00:06:34.402 --> 00:06:38.132
Don't you ever say a word about what happened today.

107
00:06:38.803 --> 00:06:41.043
You saw nothing today. Do you understand?

108
00:06:42.442 --> 00:06:43.442
Understood.

109
00:06:52.183 --> 00:06:54.423
I won't tell anyone. Never.

110
00:06:59.822 --> 00:07:00.822
All right.

111
00:07:01.923 --> 00:07:02.933
Thank you.

112
00:07:04.863 --> 00:07:05.962
One thing is certain...

113
00:07:06.363 --> 00:07:09.072
from now on, time will pass the other way.

114
00:07:10.103 --> 00:07:13.072
Whether it passes to a good direction or bad.

115
00:07:13.803 --> 00:07:14.803
I guess so.

116
00:07:16.543 --> 00:07:18.072
Now, it's my turn to ask you.

117
00:07:20.783 --> 00:07:22.212
Why did you come save me?

118
00:07:22.452 --> 00:07:24.283
I was only a dream to you.

119
00:07:24.613 --> 00:07:26.983
Why did you save me even when you had your car crushed...

120
00:07:26.983 --> 00:07:28.723
and got hurt like this?

121
00:07:31.793 --> 00:07:32.923
I don't know.

122
00:07:35.692 --> 00:07:36.933
Are you not sure?

123
00:07:37.493 --> 00:07:39.233
I think I know why.

124
00:07:40.202 --> 00:07:41.202
What do you mean?

125
00:07:44.873 --> 00:07:45.902
When did it start?

126
00:07:46.803 --> 00:07:47.873
Since when did you fall in love with me?

127
00:07:48.743 --> 00:07:51.613
What? Fall in love with you?

128
00:07:51.743 --> 00:07:53.183
Who? Me?

129
00:07:56.952 --> 00:07:57.952
Bingo!

130
00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:03.253
There must have been a misunderstanding.

131
00:08:03.293 --> 00:08:04.692
You fell in love with me when I hugged you, right?

132
00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:06.393
That's why you hugged me back, right?

133
00:08:06.592 --> 00:08:10.533
No, I only hugged you because you hugged me first. I had no feelings.

134
00:08:10.533 --> 00:08:13.503
You felt nothing? But you hugged me tight. You even patted my back.

135
00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:15.232
So you just hug any girls?

136
00:08:15.232 --> 00:08:16.232
No way.

137
00:08:16.872 --> 00:08:18.403
So I am not just any girl.

138
00:08:18.872 --> 00:08:20.942
What was it that was so special about me?

139
00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:22.442
What did you like so much about me?

140
00:08:23.572 --> 00:08:27.543
I'm confused. Why do you put it this way?

141
00:08:28.242 --> 00:08:29.253
No, I was wrong.

142
00:08:29.253 --> 00:08:32.053
You hugged me after you saved me.

143
00:08:32.423 --> 00:08:33.423
Then was it...

144
00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:35.082
at the bus stop?

145
00:08:36.692 --> 00:08:38.592
Or when you brought me...

146
00:08:39.523 --> 00:08:40.663
the rice cake?

147
00:08:42.692 --> 00:08:45.063
Oh, my goodness. So it was then!

148
00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:47.832
Did you fall in love with my voice?

149
00:08:48.332 --> 00:08:50.273
Goodness. Wait, that's not it.

150
00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:54.102
Did you move next to my house because of me?

151
00:08:55.173 --> 00:08:56.942
You are driving me crazy.

152
00:08:59.442 --> 00:09:02.082
(The Good Guy)

153
00:09:02.313 --> 00:09:03.612
(Seoul)

154
00:09:07.822 --> 00:09:10.293
Which police station? Yes.

155
00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:13.622
What's the crime and sentence for it?

156
00:09:13.862 --> 00:09:16.692
(The Bad Guy)

157
00:09:19.263 --> 00:09:20.263
I got goosebumps.

158
00:09:21.232 --> 00:09:23.872
So it's true you moved because of me.

159
00:09:24.102 --> 00:09:27.372
(The Weird One)

160
00:09:27.372 --> 00:09:30.612
(The Good Guy, The Bad Guy, The Weird One)

161
00:10:04.913 --> 00:10:05.982
Are you all right?

162
00:10:20.592 --> 00:10:21.722
Hey, get up already!

163
00:10:21.722 --> 00:10:23.793
Five more minutes.

164
00:10:25.763 --> 00:10:26.903
We're late.

165
00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:28.602
We are late!

166
00:10:29.273 --> 00:10:30.572
Hey, you!

167
00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:32.403
You little brat!

168
00:10:32.403 --> 00:10:33.403
What time is it?

169
00:10:39.883 --> 00:10:41.383
Make my cereal too.

170
00:10:42.513 --> 00:10:44.183
You make it yourself.

171
00:10:44.452 --> 00:10:45.722
I'm having a hard time.

172
00:10:46.883 --> 00:10:48.822
You are acting weird.

173
00:10:48.893 --> 00:10:50.222
What are you, a teenager?

174
00:10:51.322 --> 00:10:52.322
Jae Chan.

175
00:10:52.992 --> 00:10:53.992
What?

176
00:10:54.423 --> 00:10:56.962
Don't you ever say a word about what happened today.

177
00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:02.063
- It's nothing. - What? Are you being mysterious?

178
00:11:04.472 --> 00:11:06.403
Anyway, what's with you and the girl next door?

179
00:11:06.403 --> 00:11:07.403
You two going out?

180
00:11:08.643 --> 00:11:09.712
Do you want to die?

181
00:11:09.712 --> 00:11:11.472
Life is boring for you, isn't it?

182
00:11:11.513 --> 00:11:14.482
Why? You worried so much about her.

183
00:11:14.482 --> 00:11:16.883
You saved her despite crushing your new car.

184
00:11:18.513 --> 00:11:22.722
Mom, that guy fell in love with me completely.

185
00:11:23.553 --> 00:11:24.822
Who is that guy?

186
00:11:25.192 --> 00:11:27.092
That new guy next door.

187
00:11:27.293 --> 00:11:28.862
Young and handsome.

188
00:11:29.133 --> 00:11:32.933
Goodness. Then what about that lawyer?

189
00:11:35.303 --> 00:11:37.773
Mom, don't even start talking about him.

190
00:11:38.332 --> 00:11:41.543
He would have used me so he can make a living.

191
00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.013
So will you break up with him?

192
00:11:43.472 --> 00:11:44.712
Then do you want me to keep seeing him?

193
00:11:44.712 --> 00:11:46.683
He could've destroyed both of us.

194
00:11:46.683 --> 00:11:48.543
So now you want to go out with the guy next door?

195
00:11:50.183 --> 00:11:51.183
No, it's not that.

196
00:11:52.013 --> 00:11:53.753
It's not that I want to change my boyfriend.

197
00:11:54.253 --> 00:11:56.192
I'm just going to pay him back for saving me.

198
00:11:56.793 --> 00:11:59.192
Pay him back? What do you mean by that?

199
00:11:59.192 --> 00:12:03.133
Jae Chan saved both of our lives.

200
00:12:03.293 --> 00:12:05.803
I must pay him back for the rest of my life.

201
00:12:06.163 --> 00:12:07.702
It's only the right thing to do.

202
00:12:08.163 --> 00:12:10.273
How will you pay back?

203
00:12:10.332 --> 00:12:14.202
He seems like he has never dated any girls.

204
00:12:14.602 --> 00:12:17.273
What can I do? I should save him, shouldn't I?

205
00:12:17.372 --> 00:12:18.673
You should think this through.

206
00:12:18.673 --> 00:12:21.313
It could be paying back with disgrace.

207
00:12:21.813 --> 00:12:22.813
Disgrace?

208
00:12:24.053 --> 00:12:25.482
That sounds nice too.

209
00:12:25.622 --> 00:12:27.153
Like Romeo and Juliet.

210
00:12:28.553 --> 00:12:29.722
It makes me excited.

211
00:12:33.362 --> 00:12:34.923
She is a total lunatic.

212
00:12:35.462 --> 00:12:38.533
She thinks I fell in love with her. She's a total narcissist.

213
00:12:38.832 --> 00:12:40.903
She should go see a therapist.

214
00:12:40.962 --> 00:12:44.633
Or there should be a law to distinguish such mad people.

215
00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:45.842
That way we can avoid people like her.

216
00:12:46.303 --> 00:12:48.342
I was so unlucky to run into her.

217
00:12:48.342 --> 00:12:50.043
But you said it yourself...

218
00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:53.082
that she seemed so sad in your dream.

219
00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:54.513
She wasn't sad!

220
00:12:54.942 --> 00:12:56.082
It was rather scary.

221
00:12:56.253 --> 00:12:57.883
Yes, I saved her because she was scary.

222
00:12:57.952 --> 00:13:00.352
No. Actually, I didn't save her.

223
00:13:00.582 --> 00:13:02.952
I never said anything about my dream.

224
00:13:02.952 --> 00:13:05.692
People will think I'm crazy if they hear about my dream.

225
00:13:06.622 --> 00:13:08.322
All right. Fine.

226
00:13:13.263 --> 00:13:14.263
Who could it be at this hour?

227
00:13:18.803 --> 00:13:20.303
Hey, it's the girl next door.

228
00:13:22.143 --> 00:13:23.143
What?

229
00:13:27.683 --> 00:13:29.883
Hi, I'm Hong Joo from next door.

230
00:13:29.913 --> 00:13:31.683
Hi, how can I help you?

231
00:13:31.753 --> 00:13:33.783
Oh, whose voice is so handsome?

232
00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:36.592
Show me your face. I'm curious.

233
00:13:37.352 --> 00:13:39.423
- What's wrong with her? - See? I told you.

234
00:13:39.423 --> 00:13:40.462
She needs to be distinguished.

235
00:13:40.492 --> 00:13:41.893
I can hear you both.

236
00:13:42.732 --> 00:13:45.702
I made some rice balls to share with you.

237
00:13:46.732 --> 00:13:48.563
- Excuse me, Ms. Nam Hong Joo. - Yes?

238
00:13:48.872 --> 00:13:51.133
I can't believe what you told me about dreams.

239
00:13:51.503 --> 00:13:53.403
So it's not like I saved you.

240
00:13:53.403 --> 00:13:55.102
And you don't have to pay me back.

241
00:13:55.342 --> 00:13:56.942
You can take back your rice balls.

242
00:14:00.942 --> 00:14:02.283
She should have understood what I said.

243
00:14:03.053 --> 00:14:04.553
Oh, you can't believe it?

244
00:14:08.153 --> 00:14:09.923
I absolutely understood what you meant.

245
00:14:23.033 --> 00:14:25.072
(Flowers)

246
00:14:25.643 --> 00:14:27.673
- Good morning. - Hello.

247
00:14:52.697 --> 00:14:55.929
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E03 While You Were Sleeping "The Dream"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

248
00:15:16.753 --> 00:15:17.822
- What does a chick say? - Cheep, cheep.

249
00:15:17.822 --> 00:15:19.822
- What does a puppy say? - Bow-wow.

250
00:15:19.822 --> 00:15:21.893
- What does a bird say? - Chirp, chirp.

251
00:15:21.893 --> 00:15:23.893
- What does a chick say? - Cheep, cheep.

252
00:15:23.893 --> 00:15:26.063
- What does a puppy say? - Bow-wow.

253
00:15:26.063 --> 00:15:28.163
- What does a bird say? - Chirp, chirp.

254
00:15:28.163 --> 00:15:29.173
What does a chick say?

255
00:15:29.173 --> 00:15:32.242
It's this very tall guy with really long arms.

256
00:15:34.403 --> 00:15:36.013
His name is Jung Jae Chan.

257
00:15:47.523 --> 00:15:49.852
Thank you, Mr. Jung Jae Chan.

258
00:16:03.332 --> 00:16:04.332
Here is your coffee.

259
00:16:04.472 --> 00:16:05.673
Hello, welcome.

260
00:16:09.572 --> 00:16:10.572
Hello, welcome.

261
00:16:11.043 --> 00:16:14.813
In three minutes, a tall guy will come and make his order.

262
00:16:14.883 --> 00:16:16.553
He is wearing a beige outer.

263
00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:19.582
If he comes, please do this for me.

264
00:16:21.222 --> 00:16:22.692
-I'll have... -You are ordering an Americano...

265
00:16:22.692 --> 00:16:24.423
with double shots and hazelnut syrup, right?

266
00:16:26.122 --> 00:16:28.223
Yes, that will be it.

267
00:16:31.162 --> 00:16:32.332
I'll make the payment.

268
00:17:09.832 --> 00:17:12.303
The train will now approach...

269
00:17:17.443 --> 00:17:19.582
Please get on board after everyone gets out of the train.

270
00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:46.172
Do you know each other?

271
00:17:46.203 --> 00:17:47.243
- No. - Yes.

272
00:17:47.773 --> 00:17:48.813
- Do you want me to change seats? - No, it's fine.

273
00:17:48.813 --> 00:17:49.872
Thank you.

274
00:17:54.912 --> 00:17:57.582
The door on your left will open.

275
00:17:57.582 --> 00:18:00.382
It's me. Nam Hong Joo from next door.

276
00:18:00.523 --> 00:18:01.622
I know.

277
00:18:03.053 --> 00:18:05.053
You must have many questions now.

278
00:18:05.693 --> 00:18:07.662
You must be wondering if I followed you,

279
00:18:07.662 --> 00:18:10.033
but that's not the case because I was in the train before you.

280
00:18:10.332 --> 00:18:12.703
It seems weird to be coincidence.

281
00:18:13.503 --> 00:18:14.503
Am I right?

282
00:18:14.533 --> 00:18:16.102
Are you reading my mind now?

283
00:18:16.632 --> 00:18:17.932
I actually followed you.

284
00:18:18.503 --> 00:18:20.973
Because I saw where you were going in my dream.

285
00:18:26.912 --> 00:18:29.152
I saw the balloon getting stuck in the tree.

286
00:18:30.783 --> 00:18:32.053
I saw you ordering coffee too.

287
00:18:34.922 --> 00:18:37.622
And I saw you taking the subway to go to work.

288
00:18:38.122 --> 00:18:39.892
I also saw which stations you got on and off.

289
00:18:44.432 --> 00:18:47.632
I told you I can foresee the future in my dream.

290
00:18:48.362 --> 00:18:50.332
So it's true that you saved me.

291
00:18:50.332 --> 00:18:52.142
And it's true I owe you big time.

292
00:18:52.342 --> 00:18:53.342
Right?

293
00:19:05.553 --> 00:19:06.852
Why are you so quiet?

294
00:19:07.082 --> 00:19:08.852
I came all the way to hear your answer.

295
00:19:09.753 --> 00:19:12.392
Oh, right. You will need this later on.

296
00:19:12.963 --> 00:19:15.592
Please stand behind the yellow line.

297
00:19:15.932 --> 00:19:18.362
I don't believe in your words.

298
00:19:18.432 --> 00:19:19.803
You said you dreamed about me.

299
00:19:19.803 --> 00:19:21.132
Why are you denying it?

300
00:19:21.233 --> 00:19:22.572
I'm not denying it.

301
00:19:23.533 --> 00:19:24.632
I'm just not believing it.

302
00:19:25.273 --> 00:19:26.273
What?

303
00:19:26.303 --> 00:19:27.973
I don't want to believe it.

304
00:19:29.813 --> 00:19:32.983
I will never believe it even if I dream the same thing again.

305
00:19:33.243 --> 00:19:35.483
I don't care who dies in my dream.

306
00:19:36.453 --> 00:19:37.483
- Why not? - If I do,

307
00:19:37.483 --> 00:19:40.523
I have to save whoever is dying. If I can't do that,

308
00:19:40.523 --> 00:19:41.953
I'll have to blame myself endlessly.

309
00:19:42.122 --> 00:19:43.152
I can't handle that.

310
00:19:45.822 --> 00:19:47.162
Can you handle it?

311
00:19:53.162 --> 00:19:54.162
No, I can't.

312
00:19:58.273 --> 00:19:59.842
If you can't handle it, ignore all your dreams.

313
00:20:01.102 --> 00:20:02.842
As if they never happened.

314
00:20:02.842 --> 00:20:04.243
That will make you suffer less.

315
00:20:04.443 --> 00:20:07.443
If you really want to make a change, look for someone else.

316
00:20:11.983 --> 00:20:13.422
I could not find anyone else.

317
00:20:40.013 --> 00:20:41.642
I don't know why it had to be you.

318
00:20:50.822 --> 00:20:51.922
Look for someone else harder.

319
00:20:52.422 --> 00:20:54.322
If there are 2, there must be 3 and 4 too.

320
00:21:07.902 --> 00:21:09.213
I told you there isn't anyone else.

321
00:21:10.773 --> 00:21:11.943
It's just you.

322
00:21:18.453 --> 00:21:21.582
Dad, I dreamed something weird last night.

323
00:21:22.122 --> 00:21:23.122
Like what?

324
00:21:23.352 --> 00:21:24.793
1, 2,

325
00:21:26.293 --> 00:21:27.293
three.

326
00:21:29.892 --> 00:21:31.263
You died in my dream.

327
00:21:32.662 --> 00:21:33.763
How did I die?

328
00:21:34.533 --> 00:21:35.572
Did I bleed a lot?

329
00:21:37.203 --> 00:21:39.003
A lot of blood means a good sign.

330
00:21:39.743 --> 00:21:41.003
Snap it with your wrist.

331
00:21:41.743 --> 00:21:44.973
- Let's try again. - Your bus had an explosion.

332
00:21:46.082 --> 00:21:48.443
An explosion? How?

333
00:21:48.443 --> 00:21:50.249
A young soldier got on your bus.

334
00:21:50.274 --> 00:21:52.346
He had grenades and guns.

335
00:21:52.483 --> 00:21:54.652
Hong Joo, this is not the US.

336
00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:57.953
Your dream is very unlikely to happen.

337
00:21:57.953 --> 00:21:59.122
But what I saw was real!

338
00:21:59.592 --> 00:22:04.162
He threw the grenade in the bus. Then everyone died.

339
00:22:05.392 --> 00:22:09.102
Dad, can you not go to work today?

340
00:22:10.473 --> 00:22:12.102
My dream was too realistic.

341
00:22:12.803 --> 00:22:14.902
Was it? Then...

342
00:22:17.773 --> 00:22:21.112
if you do one thing for me, I'll think about it.

343
00:22:21.182 --> 00:22:22.283
What kind?

344
00:22:26.322 --> 00:22:28.793
No way! I will never do it.

345
00:22:32.053 --> 00:22:34.763
I didn't ask you something big. Why wouldn't you do it for me?

346
00:22:48.572 --> 00:22:50.513
You'll need this later.

347
00:22:55.213 --> 00:22:56.283
Darn it.

348
00:23:00.523 --> 00:23:03.422
Goodness. The weather forecast is never right.

349
00:23:04.652 --> 00:23:06.422
Sir, good morning.

350
00:23:06.463 --> 00:23:08.592
Goodness. I didn't know I'd run into you here.

351
00:23:08.693 --> 00:23:11.362
Hey, did you bring an umbrella?

352
00:23:13.102 --> 00:23:15.063
No, I'll run to the convenience store and get one.

353
00:23:15.063 --> 00:23:17.303
- Sir. - Hey, Ms. Shin.

354
00:23:17.402 --> 00:23:18.743
Where's your car?

355
00:23:18.872 --> 00:23:20.842
I couldn't bring it today due to our policy.

356
00:23:21.943 --> 00:23:23.872
Do you happen to have an umbrella?

357
00:23:25.943 --> 00:23:27.082
Of course.

358
00:23:27.082 --> 00:23:28.213
Gosh.

359
00:23:28.243 --> 00:23:30.352
I'll take you to the office safely.

360
00:23:30.352 --> 00:23:31.682
That's good news.

361
00:23:35.122 --> 00:23:37.922
Prosecutor Jung, what shall we do? My umbrella is too small for three.

362
00:23:37.953 --> 00:23:41.662
Oh, it's okay. I'll be fine, so just take him with you.

363
00:23:43.432 --> 00:23:44.693
Okay. Bye then.

364
00:23:46.402 --> 00:23:48.563
- Let's go, sir. - All right.

365
00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:53.872
By the way, why does he talk casually to you?

366
00:23:54.743 --> 00:23:56.672
I guess it's because he was a senior back in college.

367
00:23:56.672 --> 00:23:59.213
That was in college. He should respect the order in our office.

368
00:23:59.412 --> 00:24:01.612
That guy must have no idea.

369
00:24:02.152 --> 00:24:06.322
I know. He has a long way to go.

370
00:24:31.813 --> 00:24:33.783
I'm sorry for being late.

371
00:24:33.813 --> 00:24:35.682
It suddenly started to rain.

372
00:24:36.813 --> 00:24:39.352
Mr. Park, you went overboard this time.

373
00:24:39.652 --> 00:24:42.523
According to her medical report, you broke six of her ribs.

374
00:24:44.753 --> 00:24:48.622
Our employees had a hard time getting rid of those CCTV footages.

375
00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:52.203
I know they had a hard time. That's why I pay a hefty amount.

376
00:24:55.703 --> 00:24:59.342
A charge of injury will complicate things, so I'll talk with...

377
00:24:59.342 --> 00:25:00.973
the doctors and make it an assault.

378
00:25:01.102 --> 00:25:04.513
Write letters of apology for each date, just in case.

379
00:25:07.142 --> 00:25:08.813
You know what comes next if you get charged with assault, right?

380
00:25:09.553 --> 00:25:12.422
You must get a consent form signed by your wife.

381
00:25:12.523 --> 00:25:14.582
- So that... - I won't be prosecuted...

382
00:25:14.582 --> 00:25:18.922
because she does not have the right of arraignment. I know that much.

383
00:25:21.493 --> 00:25:23.432
Your wife will sign the form, right?

384
00:25:24.862 --> 00:25:27.432
If she doesn't, that means she will put me in jail.

385
00:25:27.662 --> 00:25:28.662
Don't worry.

386
00:25:29.902 --> 00:25:34.602
She will never make So Yoon a daughter of a convict.

387
00:25:45.553 --> 00:25:48.622
Right. Yoo Bum might think it's absurd.

388
00:25:49.053 --> 00:25:50.852
He was blamed for something he didn't do.

389
00:25:50.993 --> 00:25:52.523
And I was hugging someone else.

390
00:25:53.763 --> 00:25:55.122
It's only natural.

391
00:26:03.033 --> 00:26:04.372
Be calm.

392
00:26:05.003 --> 00:26:06.443
Talk with common sense.

393
00:26:07.072 --> 00:26:09.043
Break up with him rationally.

394
00:26:10.713 --> 00:26:11.743
You're here.

395
00:26:12.082 --> 00:26:13.412
What kind of coffee do you want?

396
00:26:14.783 --> 00:26:16.882
No, I'm leaving soon.

397
00:26:17.453 --> 00:26:20.453
I wanted to see you because I have a lot to hear from you.

398
00:26:20.822 --> 00:26:21.822
For example,

399
00:26:22.693 --> 00:26:23.753
your apology.

400
00:26:24.523 --> 00:26:25.693
I know...

401
00:26:26.662 --> 00:26:28.122
that you're disappointed by...

402
00:26:29.263 --> 00:26:31.233
how I behaved...

403
00:26:32.332 --> 00:26:33.332
when the accident occurred.

404
00:26:34.233 --> 00:26:35.703
I'm glad that you know that.

405
00:26:35.773 --> 00:26:37.303
I know what I'm doing right now...

406
00:26:37.503 --> 00:26:39.473
is not sensible at all.

407
00:26:39.642 --> 00:26:42.313
I also know that you didn't do anything wrong.

408
00:26:42.313 --> 00:26:45.313
But I'll sleep better if I end the relationship here.

409
00:26:46.983 --> 00:26:49.182
Hey, excuse me, Hong Joo.

410
00:26:49.182 --> 00:26:51.313
So let's end it here.

411
00:26:51.483 --> 00:26:54.822
Call me crazy or wish the worst of me. But I have nothing to say.

412
00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:55.822
I'm sorry!

413
00:26:56.453 --> 00:27:00.293
Are you calling this an apology?

414
00:27:00.293 --> 00:27:04.293
Yes, it is an apology. I get louder when I feel really sorry.

415
00:27:04.332 --> 00:27:07.503
Everything is my fault. I deserve all the blame.

416
00:27:07.503 --> 00:27:08.902
I sincerely apologize!

417
00:27:19.682 --> 00:27:21.483
- Hello, welcome. - Hello.

418
00:27:21.483 --> 00:27:23.152
Hello. Be careful of the slippery floor.

419
00:27:23.553 --> 00:27:25.953
Hey, why are you here?

420
00:27:26.882 --> 00:27:28.082
Why aren't you at school?

421
00:27:28.283 --> 00:27:30.652
I'm here because I'm worried.

422
00:27:32.693 --> 00:27:36.763
Goodness. If you had more dreams like that, you'd quit school.

423
00:28:02.822 --> 00:28:06.662
Dad, I saw that guy in my dream.

424
00:28:09.493 --> 00:28:10.993
It's just a coincidence.

425
00:28:19.773 --> 00:28:22.473
Dad, I think he has a gun in his bag.

426
00:28:27.713 --> 00:28:29.053
Breaking news.

427
00:28:29.582 --> 00:28:33.983
A private first class left the army base with a loaded riffle...

428
00:28:33.983 --> 00:28:36.852
and two grenades in Gangwon Province.

429
00:28:36.852 --> 00:28:39.862
He shot a police officer in a convenience store located in Seoul.

430
00:28:39.862 --> 00:28:41.993
The police and army are in search of him.

431
00:28:42.092 --> 00:28:44.832
The police officer who got shot died on the spot.

432
00:28:44.932 --> 00:28:47.763
Reporter Kim Moo Kyung will fill you in the details.

433
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.860
(Episode 4 will air shortly.)
