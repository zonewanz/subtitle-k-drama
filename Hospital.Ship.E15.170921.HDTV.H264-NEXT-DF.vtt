<i>[Episode 15]</i>

3
00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.153
Please show me your arm.

4
00:00:14.153 --> 00:00:16.671
Miss, please show me your arm.

5
00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.382
You have to show it to me
so I can treat it.

6
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.752
If you were going to be stubborn,
why did you come here?

7
00:00:24.752 --> 00:00:26.813
Can't you speak Korean?

8
00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:30.808
Do you speak Korean? Yes or no?

9
00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:34.361
If not, do you speak English?

10
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:36.860
Can you speak it or not?

11
00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:45.823
What's the matter?

12
00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:48.835
I think she hurt her arm,
but she won't talk.

13
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.077
She's talking right now.

14
00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:57.413
She is, isn't she?

15
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.068
<i>Why don't you want treatment?</i>

16
00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:05.646
<i>- I'm not here for myself.
- Then?</i>

17
00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:08.194
<i>My son is sick.</i>

18
00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:10.408
<i>Where's your child?</i>

19
00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:12.084
<i>At home.</i>

20
00:01:13.048 --> 00:01:17.965
<i>Don't worry. I can help your child.</i>

21
00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.408
<i>Where is your house?</i>

22
00:01:32.798 --> 00:01:34.277
It's that face.

23
00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:42.123
It was that expression on my man's
face that I missed so much.

24
00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.349
Your man?

25
00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.440
I guess you didn't know.

26
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.697
Doctor Kwak and I are engaged.

27
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.558
- There's another patient.
- Another patient?

28
00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:12.753
It's an emergency. I'll bring
the patient here, but in the meantime

29
00:02:12.753 --> 00:02:15.126
please treat his guardian.

30
00:02:21.477 --> 00:02:23.496
Isn't Hyun pretty cool?

31
00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:33.714
The workplace is where we work.
If you want a deeper relationship

32
00:02:33.714 --> 00:02:37.650
we can no longer be colleagues,
that's why...

33
00:02:38.782 --> 00:02:40.593
Is this the wall?

34
00:02:41.317 --> 00:02:43.972
Are you telling me not to cross it?

35
00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:45.503
That's right.

36
00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:51.141
I got it. If that's what you want.

37
00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:55.641
But, remember this.

38
00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:59.758
This might not be a wall, but a door.

39
00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:03.330
So you can open it whenever you're ready.

40
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.917
I'll be waiting on the other side.

41
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.010
Lidocaine.

42
00:03:56.365 --> 00:04:01.872
It was that expression on my man's
face that I missed so much.

43
00:04:01.872 --> 00:04:03.913
Isn't Hyun pretty cool?

44
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:12.910
Doctor.

45
00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.115
- Doctor.
- Yes?

46
00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:19.415
Aren't you going to do the sutures?

47
00:04:19.415 --> 00:04:20.564
Hand me Nylon #4.

48
00:04:20.564 --> 00:04:23.928
You're holding it right now.
It's in your hands.

49
00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:25.995
Yes.

50
00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:31.675
Did you... blank out, by any chance?

51
00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:45.488
Bring the monitor. Hurry.

52
00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:54.649
- Nurse, prepare the fluids.
- Yes, Doctor.

53
00:04:57.834 --> 00:05:02.067
His temperature is 38.7. He had
a stomachache and diarrhea for 12 hours.

54
00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:05.822
His blood pressure is 80/50.
His heart rate is over 130.

55
00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:08.853
- Then...
- It could be blood poisoning, right?

56
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:14.805
Did he have a fever or cough
in the last 10 days?

57
00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.507
Did his head hurt?

58
00:05:18.507 --> 00:05:21.838
<i>He was like this since yesterday.</i>

59
00:05:21.838 --> 00:05:25.302
- Did he eat raw seafood?
- Vibrio vulnificus septicemia?

60
00:05:25.302 --> 00:05:26.812
It's not out of the question.

61
00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:31.319
<i>Did you feed him any raw seafood?</i>

62
00:05:36.947 --> 00:05:40.927
There are no wounds infected by sea
water. And if he didn't eat raw seafood...

63
00:05:40.927 --> 00:05:44.254
Then we can exclude
vibrio vulnificus septicemia.

64
00:05:44.254 --> 00:05:45.997
What could the cause be?

65
00:05:45.997 --> 00:05:49.538
We'll give him an arteriopressor
and antibiotics and see his progress.

66
00:05:49.538 --> 00:05:51.202
Nurse Ah Rim.

67
00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:54.945
We'll give him 0.2 micrograms
of norepinephrine every hour.

68
00:05:54.945 --> 00:05:58.300
750 milligrams of cefotetan
and 250 milligrams of metronidazole.

69
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.493
Yes.

70
00:06:00.523 --> 00:06:03.231
It's not an emergency,
but we must hospitalize him.

71
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:07.225
We must culture his blood to check the
strain to give him the right treatment.

72
00:06:07.225 --> 00:06:09.324
We'll depart soon,
so we can transfer him, right?

73
00:06:09.324 --> 00:06:11.399
I'll ask the ambulance
to meet us when we arrive.

74
00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:12.586
Yes.

75
00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:19.930
Prepare the defibrillator.

76
00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:27.139
Excuse me, please calm down.

77
00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.029
- Take her out!
- Yes.

78
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:34.130
Please calm down.
It'll be okay. It'll be fine.

79
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.930
- Geez.
- Be careful.

80
00:06:39.242 --> 00:06:42.427
- 160. Doctor Song.
- Charged!

81
00:06:42.923 --> 00:06:45.165
Three, two, one. Clear!

82
00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:52.848
- Charge to 110. Doctor Song.
- Charged!

83
00:06:52.848 --> 00:06:55.295
Three, two, one. Clear!

84
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.089
- I don't think it's just an infection.
- There must be another reason.

85
00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:12.221
Doctor Song.

86
00:07:19.656 --> 00:07:21.401
If there are wounds
in an area like this...

87
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:24.444
- It's vibrio vulnificus septicemia.
- Vibrio vulnificus septicemia? Then...

88
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:28.911
If we don't treat it right away,
he could die in the next 48 hours.

89
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:31.028
I'll transfer him to the operating room.

90
00:07:32.855 --> 00:07:35.719
- Geez.
- If you just calm down...

91
00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:37.797
- Excuse me.
- Geez.

92
00:07:37.797 --> 00:07:39.430
Wait.

93
00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:45.356
Young Eun, tell her that his life will be
at risk if we don't operate immediately.

94
00:07:45.356 --> 00:07:47.329
Yeah, I'll do that.

95
00:07:48.052 --> 00:07:50.745
You're the only one who can speak
to her. Take care of her, okay?

96
00:07:50.745 --> 00:07:52.589
I got it, Hyun.

97
00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:59.024
If they don't operate right away,
his life will be at risk.

98
00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:02.499
<i>What do we do about my son?</i>

99
00:08:27.829 --> 00:08:29.536
"Young Eun?"

100
00:08:30.361 --> 00:08:33.468
Why did you call Artist Choi,
"Young Eun?"

101
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:40.545
What's your relationship
with Artist Choi?

102
00:08:41.904 --> 00:08:45.571
Nurse Yoo, don't you see the patient?
Is that important right now?

103
00:08:48.944 --> 00:08:50.390
Scalpel.

104
00:09:14.561 --> 00:09:17.165
<i>Your child will be okay.</i>

105
00:09:17.165 --> 00:09:21.074
<i>A good doctor is treating him.</i>

106
00:09:24.968 --> 00:09:28.881
Please be careful. You can
come this way. Yes, that's right.

107
00:09:28.881 --> 00:09:32.387
- Hey.
- What? Who is this?

108
00:09:32.387 --> 00:09:33.825
He's the boy's father.

109
00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:38.013
He's hurt, so we helped him get here.

110
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.799
<i>What do we do about our son?</i>

111
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.772
Welcome.

112
00:09:58.772 --> 00:10:01.659
Welcome, Artist Choi.
Please have some coffee.

113
00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:03.574
Thank you.

114
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:16.762
We only have instant coffee.

115
00:10:16.762 --> 00:10:19.449
I'm grateful for any kind of coffee.

116
00:10:23.344 --> 00:10:26.959
By the way, how are you
so good at sign language?

117
00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.537
I learned it with Hyun.

118
00:10:29.537 --> 00:10:32.863
Are you like brother
and sister with Hyun?

119
00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:37.113
Yes, kind of.

120
00:10:37.113 --> 00:10:41.069
- Is he your boyfriend?
- How did you meet Doctor Kwak?

121
00:10:42.617 --> 00:10:46.405
- Sign language class.
- Sign language class?

122
00:10:51.574 --> 00:10:55.949
This means, "I like you."
You must make a fist.

123
00:10:55.949 --> 00:11:02.007
And then touch your nose
with your fist. "I like you."

124
00:11:02.007 --> 00:11:03.853
- I...
- I...

125
00:11:03.853 --> 00:11:05.842
- like...
- like...

126
00:11:05.842 --> 00:11:08.290
- you.
- you.

127
00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:16.727
Tardy student.

128
00:11:17.801 --> 00:11:21.296
Let's move on. Let's try it together.

129
00:11:21.296 --> 00:11:23.212
This means, "I love you."

130
00:11:23.212 --> 00:11:25.766
For this, make a fist with your left hand

131
00:11:25.766 --> 00:11:30.025
and wave your right hand
on top of it. "I love you."

132
00:11:30.025 --> 00:11:33.008
- I love you.
- Please face your partner.

133
00:11:33.008 --> 00:11:38.292
Please ask your partner
what their favorite season is.

134
00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:43.166
What is your favorite season?

135
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.714
I like winter.

136
00:11:46.714 --> 00:11:51.571
What is your favorite season?

137
00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:55.435
I also... like winter.

138
00:11:55.435 --> 00:11:59.310
<i>He was in fourth year medical school,
and I was in my last year of art school.</i>

139
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.493
You're good.

140
00:12:00.493 --> 00:12:04.275
<i>- Why did you learn sign language?</i>
- I'm the tardy student.

141
00:12:04.275 --> 00:12:07.513
<i>Well, I wanted some artistic inspiration.</i>

142
00:12:07.513 --> 00:12:10.626
<i>The fact that our hands
can speak is magical.</i>

143
00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:14.502
- And Hyun...
- What about Doctor Kwak?

144
00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:16.527
He said it was because of a patient.

145
00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:17.988
A patient?

146
00:12:21.797 --> 00:12:23.510
Se Jin, we need to give you a shot.

147
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.940
<i>In his practical training,
he became close with a sick patient.</i>

148
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.100
<i>The child was deaf.</i>

149
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.826
Se Jin, you need to get better,
so you can play with your friends.

150
00:12:35.826 --> 00:12:37.563
Se Jin, you can do a good job, right?

151
00:12:37.563 --> 00:12:41.613
Se Jin, your friends said they miss you.

152
00:12:43.428 --> 00:12:47.420
He wanted to know
what that child was saying.

153
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.339
He wanted to hear her.

154
00:12:49.339 --> 00:12:53.305
He must have studied hard.
He's so good now.

155
00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:56.223
Yes, he was the most superb student.

156
00:12:56.223 --> 00:13:00.164
That patient was lucky.
That patient must have been happy.

157
00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:04.135
Well, not necessarily.

158
00:13:25.585 --> 00:13:27.042
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

159
00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:31.234
<i>Did I wake you up?</i>

160
00:13:31.234 --> 00:13:35.305
<i>How... do you know sign language?</i>

161
00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:37.053
<i>I learned because we're friends.</i>

162
00:13:39.503 --> 00:13:42.637
<i>- Is there anything you need?
- Water.</i>

163
00:13:42.637 --> 00:13:45.242
<i>- Water?
- I'm thirsty.</i>

164
00:13:45.242 --> 00:13:47.190
<i>Please give me some water.</i>

165
00:13:48.209 --> 00:13:50.142
<i>I'm on it.</i>

166
00:14:03.053 --> 00:14:06.339
Se Jin. Se Jin.

167
00:14:06.339 --> 00:14:08.590
- Doctor Yoon.
- Move.

168
00:14:12.507 --> 00:14:15.563
Prepare the defibrillator. Charge to 100.

169
00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.010
Clear!

170
00:14:18.943 --> 00:14:22.122
150. Clear!

171
00:14:39.669 --> 00:14:41.565
What about the child?

172
00:14:45.316 --> 00:14:46.728
She's gone.

173
00:14:49.934 --> 00:14:51.806
She said she wanted water.

174
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:55.641
She asked for water
because she was thirsty.

175
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.954
She said she wanted water...

176
00:15:02.808 --> 00:15:05.556
but I couldn't even do that for her.

177
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.812
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] Episode 15 Hospital Ship "Sign Language"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

178
00:15:39.849 --> 00:15:42.848
A grown man was crying his eyes out.

179
00:15:42.848 --> 00:15:46.420
Gosh, poor thing...

180
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.350
That's when I decided

181
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:52.243
I'd make him my man,
and that I'd never let him go.

182
00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:54.957
- That was what I thought.
- Wow.

183
00:15:54.957 --> 00:15:57.651
That's so romantic.

184
00:16:04.137 --> 00:16:07.638
- Do you think it's true?
- Who knows?

185
00:16:07.638 --> 00:16:09.973
Didn't Hyun say
he didn't have a girlfriend?

186
00:16:09.973 --> 00:16:13.414
- We both heard it.
- Then what's with Artist Choi?

187
00:16:13.414 --> 00:16:16.359
How would I know? Ask her directly.

188
00:16:17.332 --> 00:16:21.411
Was it because of Doctor Song?
Because he wanted to date her?

189
00:16:22.991 --> 00:16:25.478
Are you sure they're having a fling?

190
00:16:26.175 --> 00:16:29.627
- That's what my intuition tells me.
- Is he a cheater?

191
00:16:29.627 --> 00:16:31.906
Wow, I see him in a new light.

192
00:16:31.906 --> 00:16:35.638
How can Hyun cheat,
when Jae Geol can't even do it?

193
00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:39.128
That's true.
Wait, but Hyun isn't that type.

194
00:16:39.128 --> 00:16:42.614
You know how it is.
The quiet ones are unpredictable.

195
00:16:53.968 --> 00:16:59.152
<i>We dealt with the emergency,
but he needs more treatment.</i>

196
00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:02.010
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

197
00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:06.296
<i>There's a nurse at the hospital who knows
sign language, so I gave her a heads up.</i>

198
00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:08.026
<i>That's why...</i>

199
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.404
His guardians can get in.

200
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.635
Six years? Are you serious?

201
00:17:27.635 --> 00:17:29.908
Yeah, they dated really passionately.

202
00:17:29.908 --> 00:17:33.763
- It looks like they'll get married.
- They're... getting married?

203
00:17:36.953 --> 00:17:39.635
Why doesn't this door close properly?

204
00:17:41.401 --> 00:17:43.368
It'll be difficult for me to
butt in, won't it?

205
00:17:43.368 --> 00:17:46.989
- That's a given.
- It'll be hard.

206
00:17:46.989 --> 00:17:50.365
Engaged? Who's engaged?

207
00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:51.845
You.

208
00:17:51.845 --> 00:17:53.889
Geez, seriously.

209
00:17:53.889 --> 00:17:56.670
Was everything Artist Choi said a lie?

210
00:17:57.495 --> 00:18:00.230
No, it's true we dated.

211
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:04.427
Did you dump her before you came
to serve in the military? You did.

212
00:18:05.003 --> 00:18:08.228
- It's been a while.
- That's strange.

213
00:18:08.228 --> 00:18:10.695
Then why is she telling
everyone you're engaged?

214
00:18:10.695 --> 00:18:13.465
I guess she couldn't find anyone else.

215
00:18:13.465 --> 00:18:15.883
That's true.
It's hard to compete with you.

216
00:18:15.883 --> 00:18:19.182
- Where is she?
- How would I know? Call her.

217
00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:22.710
- I don't have her number.
- Did you delete it?

218
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.341
Wow, if you deleted her number,
it's really over.

219
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:27.754
So why?

220
00:18:27.754 --> 00:18:31.700
I'm sure she doesn't want anyone else to
have him, even if she doesn't want him.

221
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.940
Who? Doctor Song?

222
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.210
- Hey.
- Then is there someone else?

223
00:18:44.744 --> 00:18:48.688
Geez, these look like flowers.

224
00:18:48.688 --> 00:18:51.306
We're back...

225
00:18:51.306 --> 00:18:53.123
Welcome!

226
00:18:53.123 --> 00:18:55.708
Did Artist Choi make all of this?

227
00:18:55.708 --> 00:18:59.549
- Of course!
- What's that smell?

228
00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:04.104
- It looks delicious.
- Why are you standing there?

229
00:19:04.104 --> 00:19:07.795
- Hurry up and sit down.
- It looks delicious!

230
00:19:08.628 --> 00:19:10.930
Hurry up and eat.

231
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:16.850
- Wow, this is good!
- This is amazing.

232
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.536
You're a great cook.

233
00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:22.199
Her art is even better.
We need to sell her work

234
00:19:22.199 --> 00:19:25.000
and buy a lot of new equipment.

235
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.315
Doctor Song, is there anything you need?

236
00:19:27.315 --> 00:19:30.554
Tell me what you need.
I'll buy you everything!

237
00:19:30.554 --> 00:19:33.841
Look at you getting ahead of yourself.

238
00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:36.959
These are words of blessing.
Words of blessing.

239
00:19:36.959 --> 00:19:39.649
I'm telling her to create
more beautiful art.

240
00:19:40.336 --> 00:19:43.580
And by the way, Artist Choi

241
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.988
will live here starting today.

242
00:19:46.878 --> 00:19:49.253
- Huh?
- Why?

243
00:19:49.253 --> 00:19:51.409
Why is she barging into our dorm?

244
00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:54.613
What do you mean?
Why are you being so brutal?

245
00:19:54.613 --> 00:19:58.265
I don't paint people's bodies,
but their hearts.

246
00:19:58.265 --> 00:20:01.597
If I want to get to know their hearts,
it's best to live with them.

247
00:20:01.597 --> 00:20:03.567
It's good to eat and sleep together.

248
00:20:03.567 --> 00:20:07.701
You speak so eloquently.
You shine very brightly.

249
00:20:07.701 --> 00:20:11.258
Artist Choi, I understand your intent

250
00:20:11.258 --> 00:20:13.586
but why don't you look elsewhere?

251
00:20:13.586 --> 00:20:16.176
This place isn't very suitable
for you to stay.

252
00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:19.267
And we only have three rooms upstairs.

253
00:20:19.267 --> 00:20:22.498
That's right. I share one with
Nurse Pyo, and the other one...

254
00:20:22.498 --> 00:20:25.307
Doctor Song must use it alone.

255
00:20:26.793 --> 00:20:29.481
- Yes.
- Let's share, Bis Sister.

256
00:20:35.644 --> 00:20:37.245
Let's do that then.

257
00:20:59.853 --> 00:21:02.460
This... is your room?

258
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.029
Why is your room so empty?

259
00:21:05.653 --> 00:21:08.501
Are you going to leave soon?

260
00:21:09.162 --> 00:21:10.596
Unpack your bags.

261
00:21:12.142 --> 00:21:15.649
- Where are you going?
- Do I have to answer that?

262
00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:17.901
No.

263
00:21:26.779 --> 00:21:28.588
Don't you have anything to say to me?

264
00:21:29.613 --> 00:21:31.199
I don't.

265
00:21:34.968 --> 00:21:38.431
- What are you doing?
- Why don't you have anything to say?

266
00:21:38.431 --> 00:21:41.783
I'm sure you heard the rumors
about Young Eun and me...

267
00:21:44.068 --> 00:21:45.697
Haven't you heard?

268
00:21:46.756 --> 00:21:50.633
- I heard it.
- Then why aren't you doing anything?

269
00:21:50.633 --> 00:21:52.523
You should be mad and ask
for an explanation.

270
00:21:52.523 --> 00:21:55.206
"What's wrong with you? What happened?"

271
00:21:55.206 --> 00:21:57.683
"What did you do to me?"
Something like that.

272
00:21:57.683 --> 00:21:59.301
Why?

273
00:21:59.301 --> 00:22:02.350
Why should I be curious about that?

274
00:22:02.965 --> 00:22:04.535
Because...

275
00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:08.381
Are you really unfazed?

276
00:22:09.287 --> 00:22:13.555
Am I... nothing to you?

277
00:22:14.864 --> 00:22:16.421
Of course.

278
00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:19.651
Hyun.

279
00:22:20.974 --> 00:22:23.710
Here you are. Let's go for a walk.

280
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:32.011
Hurry. Let's go, okay?

281
00:22:32.011 --> 00:22:34.830
- Let's go outside.
- For a walk?

282
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.562
Let's talk.

283
00:23:14.048 --> 00:23:17.472
Is this the best place to come
after one year of not seeing each other?

284
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.291
Pack your bags.

285
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.403
- Go back.
- I'm here to work.

286
00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:27.123
If you're here to work, just work
instead of spreading rumors.

287
00:23:27.123 --> 00:23:28.835
What?

288
00:23:28.835 --> 00:23:31.692
- Are we engaged?
- Aren't we?

289
00:23:31.692 --> 00:23:32.874
Young Eun.

290
00:23:32.874 --> 00:23:38.555
We have couple rings, and we promised
to have two children that look like us.

291
00:23:38.555 --> 00:23:42.603
Doesn't that mean we're engaged? Do we
have to have a ceremony to be engaged?

292
00:23:42.603 --> 00:23:45.115
- This was before we broke up.
- We never broke up.

293
00:23:45.115 --> 00:23:47.709
- It's been over a year.
- I said, we never broke up.

294
00:23:47.709 --> 00:23:49.690
- You left me.
- That was a mistake.

295
00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:50.885
Young Eun.

296
00:23:50.885 --> 00:23:54.864
I made a mistake,
and you never broke up with me.

297
00:23:54.864 --> 00:23:59.389
Don't you see this? This was
the last message you sent me.

298
00:23:59.389 --> 00:24:00.882
Don't you remember?

299
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:04.689
I remember. But that night...

300
00:24:08.497 --> 00:24:13.655
<i>[Young Eun...]</i>

301
00:24:35.747 --> 00:24:37.350
That night?

302
00:24:38.566 --> 00:24:40.605
What about that night?

303
00:24:42.353 --> 00:24:44.730
Is it because I didn't reply?

304
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.353
Forget it. It's all in the past anyway.

305
00:24:47.353 --> 00:24:49.495
Yeah, forget everything.

306
00:24:49.495 --> 00:24:53.870
This happened multiple times already.
You were always there when I returned.

307
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.724
You always waited in the same place,
and accepted me whenever I came back.

308
00:24:57.724 --> 00:25:00.805
- Am I wrong?
- I wanted to be serious about our love.

309
00:25:00.805 --> 00:25:02.795
Don't talk in the past tense.

310
00:25:03.413 --> 00:25:04.920
I...

311
00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.907
reflected on my actions,
so please... just this once...

312
00:25:10.907 --> 00:25:13.372
No, I can't do that anymore.

313
00:25:13.372 --> 00:25:15.987
- Why not?
- I don't want to explain.

314
00:25:16.965 --> 00:25:19.959
What's your reason?
Are you seeing someone else?

315
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.001
- Finish your work and go back.
- Hyun.

316
00:25:24.001 --> 00:25:27.344
I'm Doctor Kwak. Can you call me
Doctor Kwak from now on?

317
00:25:27.344 --> 00:25:29.747
I'll call you Artist Choi from now on.

318
00:25:29.747 --> 00:25:32.539
- No.
- Let's use formalities too.

319
00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:35.772
- Let's talk about it.
- I have nothing more to say.

320
00:25:35.772 --> 00:25:39.192
And this is the last time
we'll meet alone.

321
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.122
You must like exercising.

322
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.567
- Yes.
<i>- Artist Choi!</i>

323
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.539
They told you to use these.

324
00:26:27.539 --> 00:26:30.593
Gosh, how am I supposed to sleep
with such thin blankets?

325
00:26:30.593 --> 00:26:32.720
It'll make my back hurt.

326
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.990
Then, ask Doctor Song for her bedding.

327
00:26:38.445 --> 00:26:41.644
That's okay. I'll just sleep with Hyun.

328
00:26:43.994 --> 00:26:45.863
What?

329
00:26:48.115 --> 00:26:53.051
What is it? Where is Artist Choi
going in that attire?

330
00:26:53.051 --> 00:26:56.918
"Gosh, it'll make my back hurt."

331
00:26:57.559 --> 00:27:00.751
"I'll just sleep with Hyun."

332
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:04.229
What? Is she crazy?

333
00:27:04.229 --> 00:27:07.481
- Doctor Song, does this make sense?
- What if it doesn't?

334
00:27:07.481 --> 00:27:11.353
- Are you unfazed by it?
- Should I be affected by it?

335
00:27:11.353 --> 00:27:13.692
Well, I guess not.

336
00:27:13.692 --> 00:27:17.903
Let's sleep. We have to start
an hour earlier tomorrow morning.

337
00:27:18.987 --> 00:27:20.817
Let's do that then.

338
00:27:24.886 --> 00:27:27.918
- That's weird.
- What's weird?

339
00:27:27.918 --> 00:27:30.052
You don't have to know.

340
00:27:35.363 --> 00:27:37.298
Is she really unfazed?

341
00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:41.894
My gut instinct has never been wrong.

342
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:11.107
