1
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:20.300
Chungmyung Police station requested cooperation...

2
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.870
related to a serial sex offender.

3
00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:25.670
The culprit knew well about the victims' house structure.

4
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.111
He cut the power and went in through the unlocked door.

5
00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:32.150
The culprit would be looking for his next victim.

6
00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:35.720
It wouldn't be so easy to be in a team that focuses on...

7
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.021
sexual assault cases.

8
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:40.350
Prior to leaving the team, I had to take a difficult case.

9
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:42.521
Sun Woo had a hard time.

10
00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.691
In the end, she was sent to another team.

11
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:48.261
He will move again in a few days.

12
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.561
We need to use a bait.

13
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:50.970
I will do it.

14
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:54.441
The culprit works for the research company's security.

15
00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:57.341
Ha Sun Woo.

16
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:59.040
Sun Woo isn't here.

17
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:01.710
I found the car.

18
00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:09.181
Promise me that you will arrest him.

19
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.550
I promise.

20
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.701
(Episode 19)

21
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.561
Why did you come so late?

22
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:54.901
I already had two cups of coffee.

23
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:56.500
Kim Yong Chul.

24
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.500
Where is Chief Director Baek?

25
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.871
Why are you in such a hurry?

26
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.901
Don't just stand there. Take a seat.

27
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:06.640
There must be a lot of things you'd like to hear from me.

28
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:08.440
Don't think about doing anything stupid.

29
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.051
Kang Ki Hyung, your pet is rather noisy.

30
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.450
You won't be able to step out of this room.

31
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:21.720
Do you want to make a bet?

32
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:26.190
Let's see if I can just walk out of this room in 10 minutes or not.

33
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.350
Do you know about Rimbaud, the poet?

34
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:53.151
He is a crazy man who died because he liked coffee so much.

35
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.331
Kang Ki Hyung.

36
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.831
Do you think I'm crazy?

37
00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:07.030
Don't try to fool around with me.

38
00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:08.470
Oh, my.

39
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.611
It'd be nice if you could just admit that in the end,

40
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.980
you are just like me.

41
00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:18.611
You are just a killing machine.

42
00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:21.880
Why do you think I'm like this?

43
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:24.190
Don't even dream of making a deal...

44
00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:26.421
with me.

45
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:29.361
Why am I like this?

46
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.260
Why?

47
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:35.260
Once upon a time, there was a boy.

48
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.600
He had a father who beat him every day,

49
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.241
and a mother who had to lay low like a dead body.

50
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.540
Living was no better than being dead to him.

51
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:49.181
Nobody paid attention to that boy.

52
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.111
Just before he nearly lost his life,

53
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.820
to escape from the fiery fit,

54
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.521
he set the place on fire.

55
00:03:58.051 --> 00:03:59.421
He barely escaped.

56
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.991
That boy was imprisoned in the mental hospital...

57
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:08.700
when he was 14 years old.

58
00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:12.500
He had a hard time after he killed his parents.

59
00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:15.301
While he was imprisoned in the mental hospital,

60
00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:17.741
he was injected with unknown substances,

61
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:20.440
beaten up, and experienced auditory hallucinations.

62
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.640
The boy was abused continuously...

63
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.880
and racked by the guilt of having killed his parents.

64
00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:30.221
So he set the hospital on fire and escaped.

65
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:32.221
And then...

66
00:04:36.861 --> 00:04:39.161
he became a real devil.

67
00:04:43.431 --> 00:04:45.570
Once people make mistakes,

68
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.741
it's hard to escape from the viscous cycle.

69
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.140
Humans act weak to the strong,

70
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.811
and strong to the weak.

71
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.811
Kang Ki Hyung.

72
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.911
Do you know what people call this kind of society?

73
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.750
Kim Yong Chul, I understand your pain.

74
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.991
But you do not know what pain is like...

75
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.590
because you can't feel anything.

76
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.931
You even killed people...

77
00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:18.531
that the society doesn't care about,

78
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:22.840
that are without rights, and forgotten by others.

79
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:26.210
That's your problem.

80
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:28.741
Can't you think simply?

81
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:34.380
Chief Director Baek San understood me.

82
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.221
But then,

83
00:05:36.981 --> 00:05:40.090
he's the type that pushes his luck.

84
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.911
I told you.

85
00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:01.281
I'll get to walk out of here on my own accord.

86
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.351
But don't you want to know...

87
00:06:05.911 --> 00:06:08.721
what's inside the bag that belongs to a psychopath?

88
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.481
What is this?

89
00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:16.791
This is my ticket to my way out of here.

90
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.250
You must know that there's been a lot of word...

91
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.361
going around inside and outside of NCI about Sun Woo.

92
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.661
Fortunately, at the scene of the incident,

93
00:06:52.991 --> 00:06:55.061
detectives from the police station in charge were present,

94
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:56.900
so it was considered as self-defense.

95
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.371
She only received three months suspension from the job,

96
00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:04.811
but it's also true that the status of NCI fell greatly because of it.

97
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.880
This lecture is one way we can calm down...

98
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.080
the negative public sentiment.

99
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.721
We need to inform people in and out of NCI that we're still..

100
00:07:16.981 --> 00:07:18.890
In a great state through the lecture.

101
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.090
One profiler compared the job to Samjokgu,

102
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.161
an imaginary animal that appears in Jeju Island's folktale.

103
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:26.960
It's an animal that can catch the legendary fox with nine tails.

104
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:29.830
It's helpful to humans,

105
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.601
but with only three legs, it's an incomplete being in the real world.

106
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.270
Historically, it's been said that its incompleteness...

107
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.241
is its simple but perfect weapon that allows it...

108
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:42.880
to hunt the legendary fox.

109
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:46.880
It stays near humans, but it cannot be one of them.

110
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.890
But when the danger is imminent, it does its job.

111
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.820
The good and bad represented by Samjokgu and the legendary fox...

112
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.760
is like the relationship of a profiler and a psychopath.

113
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.760
If crimes ceased to exist,

114
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.231
there would no longer be profilers like us.

115
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.101
We'll take some questions now.

116
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.371
Do you have any questions?

117
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:11.940
Yes?

118
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.281
By saying that you can catch criminals by thinking like them,

119
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.750
are you saying that the criminals and the profilers...

120
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:26.190
are on the same line, like two different sides of the same coin?

121
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.361
Just like you said, the features of profilers and psychopaths...

122
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:32.491
are like two different sides of the same coin.

123
00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:36.100
It's all about not crossing the line between the good and the bad.

124
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:38.570
And protecting law and justice.

125
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:42.740
That would be the eternal dilemma...

126
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:44.511
and issue for profilers.

127
00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:47.740
I'd like to ask Profiler Kang Ki Hyung a question.

128
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.051
It's been a while since the Reaper has escaped from prison.

129
00:08:51.181 --> 00:08:53.751
If you're on the other side of the coin like you said,

130
00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:56.521
you must know what the Reaper must have on his mind.

131
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.421
Why haven't you arrested him yet?

132
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.990
And what do you think made him...

133
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.161
stop killing after escaping from prison?

134
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:08.901
I'm sorry, but I do not think I can answer that question here.

135
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:10.761
Please understand.

136
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:13.901
But I can tell you this. We can arrest him,

137
00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:16.171
and we will.

138
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:20.811
- Thank you. - Thank you.

139
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.141
- Thank you. - Thank you.

140
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.350
- Thank you. - Thank you.

141
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.021
Can I have your autograph?

142
00:09:35.891 --> 00:09:38.061
Where did you get this book?

143
00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:40.360
It has gone out of print and is hard to come by.

144
00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:42.860
Here.

145
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.771
What's your name?

146
00:09:44.771 --> 00:09:49.041
Yes. I'm a future profiler, Ko Joon Hee.

147
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.141
(Root of Evil)

148
00:09:58.281 --> 00:09:59.281
Good luck.

149
00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:03.551
Can I get your business card?

150
00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:18.401
The office looks empty without Sun Woo.

151
00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:19.830
I know.

152
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.171
I didn't know Sun Woo had taken such a big part of my heart.

153
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.570
Should we send her a picture?

154
00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:27.781
Why not?

155
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:29.240
- Take a picture of me here. - Okay.

156
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.251
Here we go.

157
00:10:35.021 --> 00:10:36.181
(You can use live focus.)

158
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:38.051
1, 2, 3.

159
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:41.590
How do I look? Let me take a look.

160
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.761
The background looks a little too empty.

161
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:48.200
It does. Sun Woo might be worried.

162
00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:50.230
In that case, let's do this.

163
00:10:52.271 --> 00:10:53.870
Blurring the background makes it look a lot better.

164
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.940
It does.

165
00:10:55.271 --> 00:10:57.940
We're still working hard.

166
00:10:58.011 --> 00:10:59.171
Don't worry.

167
00:10:59.771 --> 00:11:02.141
I look much better like this.

168
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.251
Should I send this?

169
00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:06.210
Send.

170
00:11:06.281 --> 00:11:07.350
(Loading)

171
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:09.080
(The image has been saved to the camera folder.)

172
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:17.391
I'm so sorry.

173
00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:33.641
Do you want some help?

174
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:47.990
Here.

175
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:19.551
We found her early this morning.

176
00:12:19.551 --> 00:12:21.291
Out of her belongings,

177
00:12:21.921 --> 00:12:24.830
we found your business card.

178
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:27.761
What's her identity?

179
00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:30.761
She's a student majoring in criminal psychology.

180
00:12:32.271 --> 00:12:36.541
Yes. I'm a future profiler, Ko Joon Hee.

181
00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:47.311
The first one who found her is a detective from this area.

182
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.220
Detective Choi.

183
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.531
I'm Choi Hyun Jin. I work in the Female and Youth Division.

184
00:12:57.761 --> 00:12:58.830
I'm Kang Ki Hyung.

185
00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:02.261
Did you find anything suspicious?

186
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.901
(Root of Evil)

187
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.041
(Ko Joon Hee)

188
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.271
We found it on the scene.

189
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.281
The scene?

190
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.450
Are you referring to here?

191
00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:21.921
No.

192
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.151
Where she was kidnapped is different from where we found her.

193
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.661
This book was found in an alley near her home.

194
00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:31.431
When we checked the CCTV,

195
00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:33.531
we confirmed that she was kidnapped there.

196
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.340
Sir.

197
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.940
Something's bothering me.

198
00:13:47.311 --> 00:13:50.811
Ko Joon Hee's parents received a video of her being tortured.

199
00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:54.421
The way she was kidnapped...

200
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.220
resembles Song Yoo Kyung's case.

201
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:00.090
Could it be a copycat crime?

202
00:14:05.031 --> 00:14:06.291
Do you want some help?

203
00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.411
- Honey. - Yes?

204
00:14:19.411 --> 00:14:21.181
Let's watch it together.

205
00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:22.240
Okay.

206
00:14:26.251 --> 00:14:27.751
What is it? It sounds strange.

207
00:14:38.391 --> 00:14:40.561
I need to go see the victim's mother.

208
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.100
Is the field where we found your daughter...

209
00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.870
a special place...

210
00:14:54.881 --> 00:14:56.940
for you and Joon Hee?

211
00:14:58.751 --> 00:15:01.021
They tore it down,

212
00:15:02.921 --> 00:15:04.791
and it's just a lot now,

213
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:07.021
but it was the very first...

214
00:15:07.661 --> 00:15:09.220
place we bought.

215
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:12.631
It's where Joon Hee was born.

216
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.200
Even after we moved,

217
00:15:17.501 --> 00:15:18.970
the two of us sometimes...

218
00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:25.070
went to visit.

219
00:15:35.551 --> 00:15:37.151
(Criminal Psychology)

220
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.311
It bothers me...

221
00:16:03.881 --> 00:16:07.450
that she came to listen to our lecture that day.

222
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.990
If the criminal is copying Song Yoo Kyung's case,

223
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:16.860
could he have an accomplice too?

224
00:16:16.921 --> 00:16:18.960
It's a possibility.

225
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.761
Copycat criminals...

226
00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:22.901
consider themselves as equals as the original criminal.

227
00:16:22.901 --> 00:16:24.401
Not only do they copy the crimes,

228
00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:27.501
but they also think they're at the same level.

229
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.911
Are you saying they see the murderers as heroes?

230
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.970
Most copycat criminals...

231
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.681
put themselves in the same level as the murderers and admire them.

232
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.011
It's like a fandom.

233
00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:41.580
They praise the murderer and admire their crimes.

234
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.151
If it's a planned copycat murder,

235
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:46.251
they copy it exactly as if reviewing the original.

236
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:48.460
They would understand the crimes inside and out.

237
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.820
The culprit for this case...

238
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.330
copied the methods and pattern of the Song Yoo Kyung case.

239
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.061
It's as if he saw it in person and replicated it.

240
00:16:56.061 --> 00:16:57.801
The problem here...

241
00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:01.070
is that he didn't just copy the method and pattern.

242
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:04.470
Leaving the corpse in the meaningful place...

243
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.211
for the mother and the victim...

244
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.281
is not something others know.

245
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.410
That was the unrevealed signature of the Song Yoo Kyung case too.

246
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.011
How did the murderer...

247
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.920
know about that signature?

248
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.590
(Author Son Suk Ju, publishing event)

249
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.390
I thought...

250
00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:28.761
he was hiding to avoid the Reaper who escaped from prison.

251
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.630
It's surprising to see him here.

252
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:33.130
While Kim Yong Chul hid his true identity...

253
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.241
and lived with the victim's name,

254
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.110
Son Suk Ju was the only person he kept in contact with.

255
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.441
It's about Reporter Son Suk Ju.

256
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.610
I was checking on his whereabouts...

257
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.150
when I noticed that he called and received calls from one number.

258
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.021
Why would Reporter Son Suk Ju...

259
00:17:54.761 --> 00:17:58.691
The book is mostly about the interviews of the case.

260
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.330
That means, it would have been impossible...

261
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.830
to write such things without contacting Kim Yong Chul.

262
00:18:03.501 --> 00:18:04.870
Anyway,

263
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:07.271
he's the person that knows...

264
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.600
about the murderer Reaper's true identity, Kim Yong Chul.

265
00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.680
- I'm sure he expected this. - There's an announcement.

266
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.511
The scheduled meet and greet with Son Suk Ju at 3pm...

267
00:18:20.511 --> 00:18:22.951
has been canceled due to personal reasons.

268
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.150
I repeat.

269
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.561
The scheduled meet and greet with Son Suk Ju at 3pm...

270
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.971
(Me, me, me)

271
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.451
Are you all right?

272
00:19:00.491 --> 00:19:03.320
That's why I told you to take a vacation.

273
00:19:03.461 --> 00:19:04.860
How was the lecture?

274
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.090
Good.

275
00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.170
Someone asked a question.

276
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.400
"If you think like the psychopathic criminals,"

277
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.741
"why can't you catch the Reaper?"

278
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.640
It'll only get more difficult...

279
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.410
to not to go past that line...

280
00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:27.820
when we're on the border.

281
00:19:32.191 --> 00:19:34.051
Give yourself some time to rest.

282
00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:36.791
I heard there was a copycat murder case.

283
00:19:36.791 --> 00:19:37.791
Yes.

284
00:19:39.231 --> 00:19:42.061
They even copied the signature that wasn't exposed through media.

285
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.900
I think Son Suk Ju disappeared for good.

286
00:19:46.301 --> 00:19:49.201
I went through his email records, and they were sent from the US.

287
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:50.771
However, he never left the country.

288
00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:53.441
Do you think it has something to do with the Reaper?

289
00:19:53.511 --> 00:19:55.680
The scheduled meet and greet was canceled.

290
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:58.511
Even the publisher doesn't know where he is.

291
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.180
How can he suddenly get out of reach?

292
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.080
It's strange.

293
00:20:04.251 --> 00:20:05.251
Sun Woo.

294
00:20:12.231 --> 00:20:14.461
No, it's nothing.

295
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.580
Why did you suddenly barge in? We almost crashed!

296
00:20:55.471 --> 00:20:56.771
Are you crazy?

297
00:20:57.001 --> 00:20:58.840
This will be recorded on my dash cam.

298
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.311
What a crazy man.

299
00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:01.410
Gosh.

300
00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.241
Are you all right?

301
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:38.251
What happened?

302
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.551
I'll call an ambulance for you.

303
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.400
Jang Ae Ran. She's a victim of shooting incident...

304
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.670
that happened around 3am near the beltway entrance...

305
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.041
by Sin Mok Stream.

306
00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.110
The culprit chose highway at dawn on purpose...

307
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.580
when there's no one.

308
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.850
There's an entrance to the construction...

309
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.350
that's connected to the nearby intersection.

310
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.691
The road just opened, so there's no surveillance camera yet.

311
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.160
Considering the victim's age, gender, the use of a shotgun,

312
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.961
and choosing the construction area where the road gets narrow,

313
00:22:28.061 --> 00:22:29.660
it's just like Jang Gi Tae incident.

314
00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:44.080
Hey.

315
00:22:49.551 --> 00:22:50.551
Are you all right?

316
00:22:50.551 --> 00:22:52.721
It's fine. I'll call an ambulance for you.

317
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.701
He perfectly reenacted even the details of the crime.

318
00:23:10.201 --> 00:23:11.711
He's not a simple copycat.

319
00:23:20.011 --> 00:23:23.850
2 copycat crimes occurred in just 2 weeks.

320
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:25.951
It not only happened in short time,

321
00:23:25.951 --> 00:23:29.191
but if the public finds out he imitated the crime NCI solved,

322
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:33.231
it'll become a huge issue.

323
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.330
We'll suppress the media as much as possible and resolve it.

324
00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:40.231
This is very strange.

325
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.670
Do you think there's someone behind this incident?

326
00:23:49.211 --> 00:23:52.251
There will be a limit to stop the pressure from the superior office,

327
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.951
but I'll try my best to support you.

328
00:23:58.251 --> 00:23:59.920
Resolve the case...

329
00:24:00.551 --> 00:24:02.761
as if it'll be your last one.

330
00:24:03.991 --> 00:24:04.991
Yes, sir.

331
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.910
(The Reaper)

332
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.801
The dash cam and even the navigation are completely destroyed.

333
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.241
He's not a human.

334
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.311
How could he do this to someone?

335
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.311
He visited the site in advance,

336
00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:58.110
and committed crime meticulously.

337
00:24:59.251 --> 00:25:02.620
He expressed his anger even more than Jang Gi Tae.

338
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:04.451
He shot the shoulder first,

339
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.890
and fired at random after the car stopped.

340
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.830
It's the same method as the last victim of Jang Gi Tae incident.

341
00:25:13.231 --> 00:25:14.461
He committed crime...

342
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:17.461
with an evolved pattern of Jang Gi Tae.

343
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.241
Who would do this?

344
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.600
And why?

345
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.680
She has...

346
00:25:31.011 --> 00:25:32.680
an initial bracelet on her wrist.

347
00:25:36.281 --> 00:25:39.221
He passed over the previous victim's belonging to the next one.

348
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:43.721
That's the Reaper's signature.

349
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.160
Go over Kang Ho Young incident again.

350
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.271
If he's really behind this,

351
00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:54.971
that's where we should start.

352
00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:56.941
Yes, sir.

353
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.370
I looked over all the documents you mentioned.

354
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.981
A button on the trousers is missing.

355
00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:09.721
According to the forensics in charge of the case,

356
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.991
there was never a button on the trousers.

357
00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:16.691
They searched the area, but never found it.

358
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.670
A button?

359
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.011
There wasn't any.

360
00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.120
JH...

361
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:50.160
could be Ko Joon Hee's initials.

362
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.691
It's highly likely.

363
00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.930
According to the victim's mother, she wore this necklace...

364
00:26:58.001 --> 00:26:59.570
for a few years.

365
00:27:00.771 --> 00:27:02.941
Is this really from the Reaper?

366
00:27:04.541 --> 00:27:06.741
Why would the Reaper do this?

367
00:27:18.221 --> 00:27:22.660
("A Serial Murder Took Place in the Same Town at Dawn")

368
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.281
What about this one?

369
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.420
It will hide your belly.

370
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.580
I don't have belly.

371
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.521
I'm saying even if you get belly...

372
00:27:51.721 --> 00:27:53.350
For me? Really?

373
00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:54.920
What's gotten into you?

374
00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.941
Hae Won.

375
00:28:26.021 --> 00:28:28.791
Remember, Kang Ki Hyung.

376
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.561
He'll never give up.

(The Phantom Club)

378
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.910
(Criminal Psychology Research Club)

379
00:29:19.211 --> 00:29:20.441
Hey, Nana. Can you...

380
00:29:20.441 --> 00:29:23.011
Can I do it later?

381
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:25.380
I'm quite busy right now. I'm sorry.

382
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:26.981
Nana. Where are you...

383
00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:56.481
This book...

384
00:29:57.711 --> 00:29:59.650
has two people's writings.

385
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.350
It has mixed tenses.

386
00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.920
Also, everyone has his or her own way of writing,

387
00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:10.491
but the expressions used here...

388
00:30:12.061 --> 00:30:13.660
aren't just one person's.

389
00:30:16.531 --> 00:30:19.971
I'm so nervous. Why do I get so nervous from seeing you?

390
00:30:20.301 --> 00:30:21.471
How did it go?

391
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.340
Ever since the book was published,

392
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.840
there's been an increase of secret fan clubs.

393
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.110
I looked into every website.

394
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.451
First, you access through a normal domain,

395
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:35.751
but once another website approves you,

396
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:37.281
you'll get an invitation.

397
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.221
Then there will be an administrator's approval.

398
00:30:40.521 --> 00:30:43.420
You can finally join the website after that.

399
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.691
That's not the end.

400
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:47.360
After you put the password,

401
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.900
there's a code they share.

402
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:53.001
There's a shield to prevent anyone from accessing.

403
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.400
It's a complete secret club.

404
00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:58.140
I was able to break through the protection program,

405
00:30:58.741 --> 00:31:00.170
but it's crazy.

406
00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.511
I don't understand why they make something so horrible.

407
00:31:04.751 --> 00:31:06.451
(The Reaper)

408
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:11.491
But I couldn't break the final stage.

409
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.291
I'd be able to find something only if I could break it,

410
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:18.031
but there's a lock on the password.

411
00:31:18.991 --> 00:31:20.031
What are we going to do now?

412
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.070
Han! What are you doing here?

413
00:31:30.741 --> 00:31:33.941
I think I know the password.

414
00:31:43.281 --> 00:31:45.751
The secret school book clubs...

415
00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.261
hide the password in books.

416
00:31:51.691 --> 00:31:52.890
If we were to say...

417
00:31:53.691 --> 00:31:54.701
that this...

418
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.961
was written by the Reaper,

419
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.370
not Reporter Son Suk Ju,

420
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:02.441
the first IP number would refer...

421
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:03.771
to his first book.

422
00:32:05.811 --> 00:32:08.640
If that's the case, the 3rd IP number "232"...

423
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.011
would indicate the total pages of this book.

424
00:32:12.211 --> 00:32:15.781
The 2nd number "11" refers to the number of chapters,

425
00:32:16.051 --> 00:32:19.120
and the 4th number "27" refers to the line.

426
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.021
"The man that undoes the buttons..."

427
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:24.291
"goes past a woman's hand with rings on it..."

428
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:26.160
"and picks up his glasses."

429
00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:29.860
Let's pick words from here and type them in.

430
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.471
Button, man, ring,

431
00:32:36.741 --> 00:32:38.771
woman, hand, and glasses.

432
00:32:42.011 --> 00:32:43.041
Wait.

433
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.211
Buttons and rings are...

434
00:32:45.511 --> 00:32:48.721
signatures from recent serial copycat crimes.

435
00:32:49.751 --> 00:32:50.890
I'll choose...

436
00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.920
things that can be left behind and arrange them again.

437
00:32:58.261 --> 00:32:59.330
Oh, my gosh.

438
00:33:03.201 --> 00:33:07.570
Buttons and rings have already been used as signatures.

439
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:09.340
Then what would...

440
00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:11.610
the glasses mean?

441
00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.741
(The Phantom Club)

442
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.211
What if...

443
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.080
Team Manager Kang, if you think about it,

444
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.080
the fact that the Reaper leaves unique signatures...

445
00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:26.721
is something that everyone can recognize if they have...

446
00:33:26.721 --> 00:33:28.191
studied criminology.

447
00:33:28.461 --> 00:33:32.090
The media has covered the data as well.

448
00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:36.031
The problem is that the copycat had Kang Ho Young's buttons.

449
00:33:36.301 --> 00:33:39.900
That means that the Reaper and the copycat are related.

450
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.340
The copycat must be committing murder...

451
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.541
under the order of the Reaper or someone related...

452
00:33:45.541 --> 00:33:47.041
to the Reaper.

453
00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:53.481
Team Manager Kang,

454
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.481
I'm not sure if I should be doing this, but...

455
00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:02.561
The culprit has been telling us the dates of the murders.

456
00:34:07.561 --> 00:34:10.330
What do you mean he was telling us? What do you mean?

457
00:34:10.901 --> 00:34:13.901
I thought you were suspended.

458
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:19.970
Team Manager Kang, arresting the Reaper is more important.

459
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:22.280
I'll try to be careful.

460
00:34:33.091 --> 00:34:34.660
(The Phantom Club)

461
00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.321
This is the website that worships the Reaper.

462
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.330
If you look at the dates at the bottom of the page,

463
00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.700
these indicate dates prior to the recent serial murders.

464
00:34:43.361 --> 00:34:45.470
Someone had been announcing...

465
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:47.430
the murder in advance.

466
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:51.771
It's just like we thought. Someone had given orders,

467
00:34:51.771 --> 00:34:54.410
and the copycat committed the murder on the given date.

468
00:34:54.881 --> 00:34:58.350
That means it could be any one of the members from this website.

469
00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.111
We searched through the website,

470
00:35:00.111 --> 00:35:02.251
but that was all the indication of dates we could find.

471
00:35:02.421 --> 00:35:05.151
There hasn't been a notice indicating the next murder.

472
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:06.751
Keep checking the website,

473
00:35:06.751 --> 00:35:10.160
and find out about the members and the administrators of the website.

474
00:35:10.591 --> 00:35:11.591
Yes, sir.

475
00:35:12.731 --> 00:35:15.100
This is really like a phantom club.

476
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.631
We can't check their personal details with this.

477
00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:19.631
If you look at the pattern of the 1st and the 2nd case,

478
00:35:19.631 --> 00:35:21.140
after someone uploads the fanfiction,

479
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.401
the murder happens within five days.

480
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640
Team Manager Kang,

481
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.311
I've been tracking the IP address of the administrator.

482
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.450
The website has been managed secretly,

483
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.620
and it's been using proxy servers.

484
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.321
It's impossible for me to track anymore.

485
00:35:37.521 --> 00:35:39.050
We do not know...

486
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.961
when the murder would happen,

487
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:43.921
who the victim would be,

488
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.890
nor which crime he would copy.

489
00:35:45.961 --> 00:35:48.001
We can't determine the time of the murder either.

490
00:35:48.061 --> 00:35:49.260
The story...

491
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.600
just indicates the place.

492
00:35:53.171 --> 00:35:54.171
Team Manager Kang,

493
00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.640

00:36:41.151 --> 00:36:43.751
goes deeper inside while lowering himself.

500
00:36:44.291 --> 00:36:45.321
In the dark room,

501
00:36:45.521 --> 00:36:47.591
a middle-aged man puts his hand in pure water...

502
00:36:47.591 --> 00:36:49.220
and bows down.

503
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:53.361
That's when the man's knife heads toward the other's neck.

504
00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:34.001
Help me! Help me!

505
00:37:43.711 --> 00:37:45.780
Help me. Please help me.

506
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.010
Someone is trying to kill me.

507
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.981
Please help me.

508
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.751
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

509
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.561
Please don't kill me.

510
00:38:10.585 --> 00:38:13.817
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 19 Criminal Minds</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

511
00:38:26.921 --> 00:38:29.620
The man covers the middle-aged man's eyes with a black cloth.

512
00:38:30.061 --> 00:38:32.061
After killing the middle-aged man,

513
00:38:32.061 --> 00:38:35.231
the man leaves like a shadow.

514
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.811
The story is describing the crime scene in detail again.

515
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:54.421
Stained glass. In front of a cross.

516
00:38:54.881 --> 00:38:56.881
A middle-aged man who bows his head.

517
00:38:59.751 --> 00:39:01.720
The story is describing a church.

518
00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.260
The culprit...

519
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.930
is trying to imitate Jung Do Il and commit a murder at a church.

520
00:39:15.541 --> 00:39:17.640
Only public law shall be like water.

521
00:39:21.211 --> 00:39:24.080
Team Manager Kang, the culprit has committed another murder.

522
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.680
This time, the culprit committed murder at the same time that...

523
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.550
the story was updated.

524
00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:35.620
- They're here. - They're here.

525
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:40.291
Does this case have anything to do with the past cases of NCI?

526
00:39:40.291 --> 00:39:41.760
This does not seem to be the copycat's crime.

527
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.300
What does the NCI think about this?

528
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.631
People have been saying that the Reaper is behind this.

529
00:39:45.631 --> 00:39:47.501
What do you think about this?

530
00:39:47.571 --> 00:39:49.970
- Please make a comment on it. - Please say a word.

531
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.671
- Please comment. - Please say something.

532
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.961
He did copy Jung Do Il's case,

533
00:40:13.591 --> 00:40:15.030
but the pattern is a little different.

534
00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.700
It's not like the previous murders,

535
00:40:17.631 --> 00:40:20.970
which were conducted in a relaxed and a calm state.

536
00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.111
Also, this is not the place that was mentioned in the story.

537
00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.740
The wounds suggest...

538
00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:34.950
that the culprit stabbed the victims' bodies hastily.

539
00:41:02.381 --> 00:41:04.680
The victims must have run all the way here...

540
00:41:04.811 --> 00:41:07.580
from the church to escape from the culprit.

541
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.450
This would only be possible if the culprit had been...

542
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:11.850
met with an unexpected situation.

543
00:41:13.091 --> 00:41:15.760
The culprit would have been startled by the situation,

544
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:17.691
but he could not postpone...

545
00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.091
the D-Day.

546
00:41:20.591 --> 00:41:23.300
The period between each murder is getting shorter.

547
00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.300
They probably want to prove to the world...

548
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:28.300
that we are not strong...

549
00:41:28.501 --> 00:41:31.041
and that the government authority can fail.

550
00:41:33.171 --> 00:41:34.580
But why didn't they...

551
00:41:34.811 --> 00:41:37.981
leave the previous victim's belongings as a signature?

552
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:43.981
This was left next to the body.

553
00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:45.890
I thought it was the victim's,

554
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.091
but according to his family, they're not his glasses.

555
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:52.691
(Written by Son Suk Ju)

556
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.600
It's Son Suk Ju's glasses.

557
00:42:00.483 --> 00:42:02.923
On four different fan fiction uploads,

558
00:42:02.923 --> 00:42:04.894
there is a comment that's repeatedly uploaded.

559
00:42:06.593 --> 00:42:09.834
What is this "MW99" that's right beside the comment?

560
00:42:10.034 --> 00:42:11.563
I'm not sure.

561
00:42:11.588 --> 00:42:12.934
Could it be the administrator's nickname?

562
00:42:12.934 --> 00:42:14.003
What could it mean?

563
00:42:14.974 --> 00:42:17.403
It looks like an abbreviation of some sort.

564
00:42:17.903 --> 00:42:21.374
Could it be like a secret code that only they know?

565
00:42:21.374 --> 00:42:23.343
If it's their code,

566
00:42:23.613 --> 00:42:27.014
then "MW" must be referring to the same thing.

567
00:42:27.014 --> 00:42:28.054
I'll look it up.

568
00:42:31.823 --> 00:42:32.923
"Mystery World".

569
00:42:33.423 --> 00:42:35.693
The "MW" stands for "Mystery World".

570
00:42:35.894 --> 00:42:38.093
It's a tabloid newspaper provided for the mystery novel advocates...

571
00:42:38.093 --> 00:42:41.793
and the students majoring in criminal psychology.

572
00:42:43.733 --> 00:42:47.034
I'm sure there will be a clue somewhere on here.

573
00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:51.974
Detective club members are usually...

574
00:42:52.644 --> 00:42:55.443
the main readers of chain newspapers like us.

575
00:42:56.144 --> 00:42:58.843
It's hard to select which story to publish.

576
00:42:59.014 --> 00:43:01.713
Do you know where these papers are distributed?

577
00:43:02.014 --> 00:43:04.883
Mostly to universities and mystery club rooms.

578
00:43:05.224 --> 00:43:07.253
If we weren't servicing online,

579
00:43:07.494 --> 00:43:09.224
we wouldn't have any business.

580
00:43:09.923 --> 00:43:12.624
People continue to buy space for advertisement,

581
00:43:12.624 --> 00:43:14.233
so we're able to make a living.

582
00:43:14.564 --> 00:43:15.564
Advertisements?

583
00:43:15.834 --> 00:43:17.863
Sun Woo, look at this.

584
00:43:18.334 --> 00:43:20.363
Look at these past advertisements.

585
00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:22.503
This is the same location and time for Ko Joon Hee's case,

586
00:43:22.673 --> 00:43:26.043
and this one matches Jang Ae Ran's case.

587
00:43:27.573 --> 00:43:30.343
Can you tell us who paid for these advertisements?

588
00:43:30.443 --> 00:43:31.943
Those?

589
00:43:32.983 --> 00:43:35.084
They just sent us money starting last month.

590
00:43:35.354 --> 00:43:37.483
They wanted to stay anonymous.

591
00:43:38.354 --> 00:43:40.153
It's hard to find out exactly who.

592
00:43:41.153 --> 00:43:44.724
We're happy to print advertisements as long as we're paid.

593
00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.133
Yes.

594
00:43:57.133 --> 00:43:59.974
Sir, the criminals used newspaper advertisements...

595
00:44:00.043 --> 00:44:02.443
to share the time and location in advance.

596
00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:04.383
Okay.

597
00:44:13.383 --> 00:44:15.523
Check the CCTV footages from the day of the lecture,

598
00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:17.963
and compare them to the CCTV footages of this area.

599
00:44:18.363 --> 00:44:20.494
See if there is anyone that look the same.

600
00:44:22.334 --> 00:44:23.363
Okay.

601
00:44:30.733 --> 00:44:31.903
(Unidentified Number)

602
00:44:38.814 --> 00:44:41.454
(Unidentified Number)

603
00:44:47.253 --> 00:44:48.923
It's been a while, Kang Ki Hyung.

604
00:44:52.863 --> 00:44:53.894
How are they?

605
00:44:55.334 --> 00:44:58.403
Do you like my presents this time?

606
00:44:59.034 --> 00:45:01.173
If you're still trying to make a deal with me,

607
00:45:02.334 --> 00:45:03.834
it'd be better that you stop.

608
00:45:12.914 --> 00:45:16.184
I guess you didn't like the presents.

609
00:45:16.284 --> 00:45:17.523
Kim Yong Chul.

610
00:45:18.523 --> 00:45:21.954
It's me that you want. Don't touch other people.

611
00:45:24.894 --> 00:45:26.624
I'm not sure.

612
00:45:29.034 --> 00:45:30.963
I must be getting old.

613
00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:35.104
I'm getting greedy.

614
00:45:39.474 --> 00:45:41.514
Do you like surprises?

615
00:45:44.744 --> 00:45:45.883
Kim Yong Chul.

616
00:45:48.414 --> 00:45:50.153
You scared me.

617
00:45:51.954 --> 00:45:53.854
You must like surprises...

618
00:45:54.054 --> 00:45:57.354
to startle me like that. You can look forward to it...

619
00:45:58.894 --> 00:46:00.793
because it's going to get fun.

620
00:46:36.733 --> 00:46:39.104
No. I'm fine, Mom.

621
00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:41.204
Something busy came up for him at work.

622
00:46:42.304 --> 00:46:43.503
It's nothing.

623
00:46:44.133 --> 00:46:45.673
I told you, everything's fine.

624
00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:47.974
Dad's always busy.

625
00:46:49.144 --> 00:46:53.284
Mom. I'm fine, so don't worry.

626
00:46:53.684 --> 00:46:54.753
Okay?

627
00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:16.903
Sir, I analyzed the CCTVs near the scene of the third murder.

628
00:47:17.573 --> 00:47:20.204
Out of the people that were at the open lecture,

629
00:47:20.343 --> 00:47:23.613
I found the identities of three people that look similar.

630
00:47:24.144 --> 00:47:26.443
All three are rather tall,

631
00:47:26.983 --> 00:47:28.684
and they're members of the mystery club.

632
00:47:29.014 --> 00:47:32.354
All three of them were at the lecture with Ko Joon Hee.

633
00:47:33.153 --> 00:47:35.894
Check if any of the three have relationships...

634
00:47:35.894 --> 00:47:37.693
with the other victims.

635
00:47:37.863 --> 00:47:41.293
Also, check their criminal records or anything out of ordinary.

636
00:47:41.494 --> 00:47:43.133
Yes, sir. I'll check right away.

637
00:47:44.164 --> 00:47:46.334
What could the Reaper be planning?

638
00:47:46.534 --> 00:47:47.704
Gather the team for me.

639
00:47:48.434 --> 00:47:49.434
Okay.

640
00:48:26.144 --> 00:48:28.014
Out of the cases we solved,

641
00:48:28.043 --> 00:48:30.843
let's condense down to the cases with unique signatures.

642
00:48:30.843 --> 00:48:33.883
There aren't too many cases the culprit can copy.

643
00:48:34.354 --> 00:48:35.354
Sir.

644
00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:38.454
There is another update of the fan fiction.

645
00:48:41.253 --> 00:48:42.854
It's a prediction of the fourth murder.

646
00:48:45.863 --> 00:48:47.463
(The Phantom Club)

647
00:48:47.463 --> 00:48:49.963
(There are cars passing by. A man is in a car.)

648
00:49:06.814 --> 00:49:10.923
Hello, I'm the one that called yesterday.

649
00:49:12.753 --> 00:49:14.554
I see you.

650
00:49:20.423 --> 00:49:21.934
No, I'll go over.

651
00:49:21.934 --> 00:49:25.434
(She laughs and says...)

652
00:49:27.104 --> 00:49:29.733
It's very close to the Ahn Sang Cheol case...

653
00:49:29.974 --> 00:49:31.903
that kidnapped women he met by making secondhand deals.

654
00:49:32.244 --> 00:49:35.943
If they uploaded a new posting, there must be a new advertisement.

655
00:49:36.244 --> 00:49:37.914
I was just looking at it.

656
00:49:38.014 --> 00:49:40.744
It just says 3:50pm for gathering.

657
00:49:42.454 --> 00:49:44.184
We only have three hours.

658
00:49:44.684 --> 00:49:46.253
We have to figure out the location quickly.

659
00:49:47.224 --> 00:49:49.293
Just as the fan fiction says,

660
00:49:49.494 --> 00:49:52.523
I'll look into bus stops in front of department stores.

661
00:49:52.523 --> 00:49:54.023
I'll get started.

662
00:49:55.264 --> 00:49:57.963
In the fan fiction, there is a passage that goes like this...

663
00:49:57.963 --> 00:49:59.164
before the deal happens.

664
00:50:00.133 --> 00:50:02.974
"I could feel the Reaper's phantom that was chasing me."

665
00:50:03.474 --> 00:50:06.843
"The Reaper shattered into pieces and scattered all over."

666
00:50:07.814 --> 00:50:09.173
"They jumbled up in front of my eyes."

667
00:50:09.443 --> 00:50:10.443
This...

668
00:50:11.144 --> 00:50:13.684
must refer to anagrams.

669
00:50:14.684 --> 00:50:16.684
If the word "Reaper" gets scattered and letters get mixed up...

670
00:50:16.854 --> 00:50:18.483
R, E, A, P, E, R.

671
00:50:18.653 --> 00:50:21.323
The letters in "Reaper" were used to make new words.

672
00:50:21.494 --> 00:50:22.753
There are three vowels,

673
00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:26.593
and on top of that, they are two of the same vowel.

674
00:50:26.994 --> 00:50:28.233
You can't make a new word from this combination.

675
00:50:32.534 --> 00:50:33.534
Parere.

676
00:50:33.903 --> 00:50:36.434
It means "to like" in Italian.

677
00:50:36.773 --> 00:50:39.104
Sir, parere is often used...

678
00:50:39.744 --> 00:50:42.343
for naming restaurants or cafes.

679
00:50:43.244 --> 00:50:45.744
Nana. Out of the places you found,

680
00:50:45.784 --> 00:50:49.253
are there any cafes with the word "parere" in it?

681
00:50:49.314 --> 00:50:51.124
Find out if there are any stores with the word "parere".

682
00:50:51.684 --> 00:50:53.684
Yes. I'm sorting them out right now.

683
00:50:54.394 --> 00:50:57.224
Among them, within 1km,

684
00:50:57.293 --> 00:51:00.023
there are three cafes with the same initials.

685
00:51:00.463 --> 00:51:02.534
Parere, amio parere,

686
00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:04.403
and parere special rateau.

687
00:51:05.264 --> 00:51:07.903
We can't have a lot of manpower in this secret investigation.

688
00:51:08.374 --> 00:51:10.304
You can only contact the site support team.

689
00:51:10.304 --> 00:51:13.704
Divide into three places, and lay in wait.

690
00:51:52.043 --> 00:51:54.914
(The Phantom Club)

691
00:52:02.423 --> 00:52:05.164
(The Reaper)

692
00:52:10.793 --> 00:52:13.204
There must be at least one person...

693
00:52:13.963 --> 00:52:16.874
with a motive to murder around the victims.

694
00:52:18.804 --> 00:52:19.843
Wait.

695
00:52:20.673 --> 00:52:21.744
Min Young.

696
00:52:23.113 --> 00:52:24.184
Look at this.

697
00:52:27.483 --> 00:52:28.584
The Phantom Club...

698
00:52:28.684 --> 00:52:30.954
originates from a mystery solving website, "Journal Holmse".

699
00:52:31.784 --> 00:52:32.784
What about it?

700
00:52:32.784 --> 00:52:34.323
The first victim Ko Joon Hee.

701
00:52:34.523 --> 00:52:35.994
JH on her ring.

702
00:52:36.994 --> 00:52:40.023
That's not her initials,

703
00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:41.793
but the website's initials?

704
00:52:41.793 --> 00:52:43.093
Yes, I think so.

705
00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:45.133
Although this website is closed,

706
00:52:45.334 --> 00:52:46.633
the initial administrator...

707
00:52:47.874 --> 00:52:49.173
was Ko Joon Hee.

708
00:52:51.273 --> 00:52:53.503
It must be related to the suspects.

709
00:53:03.983 --> 00:53:05.983
Please look up a website called Journal Holmse.

710
00:53:06.253 --> 00:53:07.653
- Journal Holmse? - Yes.

711
00:53:10.793 --> 00:53:12.093
It's closed.

712
00:53:12.593 --> 00:53:13.863
Look up...

713
00:53:13.863 --> 00:53:16.793
if any of the suspects was a member of the website.

714
00:53:20.704 --> 00:53:21.704
I found it.

715
00:53:22.173 --> 00:53:23.233
Kang Chi Hwan.

716
00:53:23.374 --> 00:53:27.543
He's a classmate of the first victim, Ko Joon Hee.

717
00:53:31.744 --> 00:53:34.284
If the birth of the Phantom Club is Journal Holmse,

718
00:53:34.684 --> 00:53:38.854
it means both of them belonged to the same club all along.

719
00:53:42.253 --> 00:53:43.323
Look here.

720
00:53:43.323 --> 00:53:45.463
(Ko Joon Hee)

721
00:53:45.963 --> 00:53:49.894
Do you think Ko Joon Hee realized what Kang Chi Hwan was after?

722
00:53:50.133 --> 00:53:52.164
If they were in a relationship,

723
00:53:52.733 --> 00:53:54.403
it'd be easier to notice.

724
00:53:55.173 --> 00:53:58.704
What do you think made him stop killing after escaping from prison?

725
00:54:01.673 --> 00:54:05.983
He currently goes to the same school as Ko Joon Hee went to.

726
00:54:06.244 --> 00:54:07.784
He doesn't have any previous record,

727
00:54:07.784 --> 00:54:09.554
but he has a record of early discharge...

728
00:54:09.554 --> 00:54:12.383
from the army due to a mental illness.

729
00:54:13.784 --> 00:54:16.023
I searched the name Shin Hye Mi...

730
00:54:16.023 --> 00:54:17.454
who sent money to Mysterious World account.

731
00:54:18.463 --> 00:54:19.764
I confirmed...

732
00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:22.834
that those two are currently operating Phantom Club.

733
00:54:23.133 --> 00:54:24.733
Send the suspect file...

734
00:54:25.363 --> 00:54:27.003
to Kim Hyun Jun immediately.

735
00:54:30.034 --> 00:54:32.244
(Account details of Kang Chi Hwan)

736
00:54:32.804 --> 00:54:34.213
Phantom.

737
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:42.021
that those two are currently operating Phantom Club.

738
00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.920
Send the suspect file...

739
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:46.190
to Kim Hyun Jun immediately.

740
00:54:49.221 --> 00:54:51.431
(Account details of Kang Chi Hwan)

741
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:53.400
Phantom.

742
00:55:04.454 --> 00:55:05.823
It's 3:50pm.

743
00:55:05.894 --> 00:55:08.024
Do you think the culprit noticed?

744
00:55:22.704 --> 00:55:23.943
We had a breakout.

745
00:55:24.544 --> 00:55:27.244
There was a cleverly disguised IP.

746
00:55:28.414 --> 00:55:29.814
I'll change the plan.

747
00:55:35.323 --> 00:55:36.483
Let's go out first.

748
00:56:17.664 --> 00:56:18.994
Are you here for a camera?

749
00:56:18.994 --> 00:56:21.463
Yes. You're late.

750
00:56:21.463 --> 00:56:22.733
I'm sorry.

751
00:56:22.733 --> 00:56:25.403
It took me a while to find a parking spot.

752
00:56:27.303 --> 00:56:29.374
Where's the camera?

753
00:56:29.374 --> 00:56:33.314
It's in the car. I also brought some accessories.

754
00:56:34.613 --> 00:56:35.644
Will you go with me?

755
00:56:36.084 --> 00:56:37.414
I'll give you the camera,

756
00:56:37.914 --> 00:56:40.454
and I will also...

757
00:56:40.653 --> 00:56:41.823
give you a ride.

758
00:56:43.624 --> 00:56:44.624
Sure.

759
00:56:44.624 --> 00:56:45.724
Let's go.

760
00:57:09.184 --> 00:57:10.184
It's Kang Chi Hwan.

761
00:57:11.013 --> 00:57:13.883
C48. By the crosswalk. We found the suspect.

762
00:57:54.153 --> 00:57:55.193
Move!

763
00:57:55.624 --> 00:57:56.624
Don't come.

764
00:57:58.494 --> 00:57:59.494
Come here.

765
00:57:59.633 --> 00:58:00.633
Come here.

766
00:58:05.104 --> 00:58:06.104
Kang Chi Hwan.

767
00:58:06.803 --> 00:58:08.504
Put down the knife, and let's talk.

768
00:58:09.144 --> 00:58:11.013
We're not in that stage yet.

769
00:58:11.013 --> 00:58:12.173
Kang Chi Hwan.

770
00:58:15.584 --> 00:58:17.013
Everyone get out!

771
00:58:27.794 --> 00:58:29.823
What's going on? What's wrong with him?

772
00:58:29.823 --> 00:58:30.823
What?

773
00:58:31.564 --> 00:58:33.763
What's going on?

774
00:58:35.204 --> 00:58:36.363
My goodness.

775
00:58:36.664 --> 00:58:37.874
Put the gun down.

776
00:58:38.633 --> 00:58:40.033
Put the gun down!

777
00:58:45.244 --> 00:58:46.343
Kang Chi Hwan.

778
00:58:47.244 --> 00:58:48.314
Calm down.

779
00:58:55.354 --> 00:58:56.584
Let her go,

780
00:58:57.423 --> 00:58:58.693
and let's talk.

781
00:58:59.954 --> 00:59:01.564
We can talk this out.

782
00:59:03.693 --> 00:59:06.164
Don't try to trick me.

783
00:59:06.533 --> 00:59:07.664
No!

784
00:59:29.383 --> 00:59:32.193
You followed the posting on the website.

785
00:59:32.193 --> 00:59:35.394
Don't you want to know what it feels like to kill someone?

786
00:59:35.664 --> 00:59:37.394
There must be another follower.

787
00:59:38.033 --> 00:59:39.193
Chief Director?

788
00:59:39.693 --> 00:59:41.334
What are you trying to do with me?

789
00:59:41.463 --> 00:59:44.033
Kill her if you want to save your daughter.

790
00:59:47.774 --> 00:59:49.774
You crazy jerk.

791
00:59:49.774 --> 00:59:51.943
You are just a killing machine.

792
00:59:52.073 --> 00:59:53.644
Now that he began,

793
00:59:53.644 --> 00:59:55.283
he'll never stop.

794
00:59:55.383 --> 00:59:58.914
The Reaper wanted to destroy our team in the first place.
