1
00:00:05.908 --> 00:00:10.908
In a moment, the Tribe has begun
their survival in Taveuni Island.

2
00:00:11.338 --> 00:00:13.348
- We did it.
- They finished building the house.

3
00:00:13.508 --> 00:00:16.077
One team goes to the river, and
another team goes to the forest...

4
00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:17.378
for their night hunting.

5
00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:19.618
- Here it is!
- And at last,

6
00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:22.888
they are face to face with the
biggest treasure of the jungle.

7
00:00:23.388 --> 00:00:25.789
However, their sweet dreams lasted briefly.

8
00:00:26.028 --> 00:00:28.629
The Tribe fell into an unexpected
peril during their survival.

9
00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.829
What's their fate at the crossroad?

10
00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:36.068
The Law of Jungle in the
Garden of Spirits begins now.

11
00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:41.008
We came far so we have
to take something back.

12
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:43.479
- Okay.
- We won't go back if we don't.

13
00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:45.918
- We must catch something.
- The water is cold.

14
00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:50.818
(Determined to catch fish, they
will succeed by all means.)

15
00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.558
(Fish, come to me.)

16
00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.589
There's nothing here.

17
00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:59.527
(At last, )

18
00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:01.089
(she spots a big one.)

19
00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.158
Okay.

20
00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.098
Hey, stay there.

21
00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.137
(Hey, fish. Stay where you are.)

22
00:01:10.138 --> 00:01:12.739
(I will catch you under the
name, Master of Taekwondo.)

23
00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:16.437
(She gets her harpoon ready.)

24
00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:18.039
(Shoot!)

25
00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:20.607
I didn't get it?

26
00:01:20.608 --> 00:01:23.017
(The whereabouts of the fish are unknown.)

27
00:01:23.018 --> 00:01:25.619
(I guess I missed it by a close call.)

28
00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:30.009
(After she puts on the swimming
goggles, she pursues the fish.)

29
00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:34.229
(I'm going to find out!)

30
00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:38.357
(Even the low water
temperature can't stop...)

31
00:01:38.358 --> 00:01:40.998
(Bo Mi's strong will to hunt.)

32
00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:46.667
(Tae Gon, Dam, and Yun Hyeong are
searching around the waterfall.)

33
00:01:46.668 --> 00:01:49.108
(It's Yun Hyeong's first
time hunting in the jungle.)

34
00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:53.048
(There's something here.)

35
00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:57.917
(He aims his harpoon after
spotting something.)

36
00:01:57.918 --> 00:01:59.718
(Prodding)

37
00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:03.319
(It's just a stick.)

38
00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:06.889
(He's so embarrassed.)

39
00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.329
(Dam is also searching for
the fish the best he can.)

40
00:02:12.628 --> 00:02:15.268
(However, the water is very murky.)

41
00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.098
(It's not easy to find fish.)

42
00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:20.869
Can you see anything?

43
00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:23.679
You can't see, can you?
Isn't it really murky?

44
00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.777
On top of that fact that
I can't see anything,

45
00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.178
There's nothing here.
- A single fish hasn't passed by me.

46
00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.519
- There's no fish here.
- I haven't spotted one fish.

47
00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:32.518
Shall we head toward the waterfall?

48
00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.649
Let's go there.

49
00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.018
(Tae Gon dives deep near the
waterfall with full of energy.)

50
00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.027
I dove into the water, but it was the same.

51
00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:42.028
(There's none in deep water too.)

52
00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.059
I spotted a few of small
fish near the bottom.

53
00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.027
I thought we weren't lucky
in the food department.

54
00:02:47.028 --> 00:02:49.239
(Gosh, this is too cruel.)

55
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.285
I thought I would pass out
before I caught a fish.

56
00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.538
That's when we decided to call it a day.

57
00:02:56.408 --> 00:02:59.248
There's none. No matter how
hard I looked, there's nothing.

58
00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:01.978
The water is freezing cold.

59
00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.589
(Their body temperature drops down.)

60
00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.989
- Let's get out.
- Okay.

61
00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.919
Gosh, it's so cold in here.

62
00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.257
- Gosh, it's so cold.
- I can't see well.

63
00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:15.498
I can't even see what's in front of me.

64
00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.929
I dove all the way to the bottom,
but there's still no fish.

65
00:03:18.968 --> 00:03:20.298
(Even the king of fishing can't
do anything as there's no fish.)

66
00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.299
It's raining.

67
00:03:21.938 --> 00:03:24.438
(What's worse is that it starts raining.)

68
00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.507
We should get out of the water first.
There's no fish here.

69
00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.437
(We walked over 1 hour to get here...)

70
00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:33.477
(and we were in the water
for over 30 minutes.)

71
00:03:33.478 --> 00:03:36.718
(Oh, no. How mean of the fish.)

72
00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.747
(Oh, spirits! Where are the fish?)

73
00:03:41.748 --> 00:03:42.918
Fish!

74
00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.018
(Fish, )

75
00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.187
(I want to see you.)

76
00:03:46.188 --> 00:03:47.828
You're losing it.

77
00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.598
- There's no fish. Not even one.
- You're slowly losing it.

78
00:03:50.628 --> 00:03:52.268
(They decide to return to the base camp.)

79
00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:53.929
I'm starving.

80
00:03:54.498 --> 00:03:55.578
Hang in there a bit longer.

81
00:03:57.098 --> 00:04:00.108
(They are preparing to build
the columns after the floor.)

82
00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.209
(Jin Woon, the 4th timer, is in
charge of making the columns.)

83
00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.448
(Kang Nam, the 9th timer, is
in charge of digging holes.)

84
00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.119
(Moon Sik, the 2nd timer,
is wrapping up flooring.)

85
00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:14.818
(What is Cho Rong, the first timer, doing?)

86
00:04:16.188 --> 00:04:19.087
(She's placing the bamboo
tree on top of the fire.)

87
00:04:19.088 --> 00:04:23.029
(Is she using the bamboo
tree as the firewood?)

88
00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:26.198
They're for the pot.

89
00:04:27.498 --> 00:04:29.338
Should I close it with
the lid to cook them?

90
00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.708
I'm trying to cook the bananas.

91
00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:37.479
When I just put them in, only
the banana peels got burnt.

92
00:04:37.638 --> 00:04:38.747
Do you need to cook it more?

93
00:04:38.748 --> 00:04:40.747
Yes. I'm going to put
them back into the fire.

94
00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:41.988
I want to cook them a bit more.

95
00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:47.618
(She rolls bananas with the banana
leaves to avoid burning them.)

96
00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:49.458
I need to cook something for them.

97
00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.187
Great.

98
00:04:53.188 --> 00:04:55.228
(She places it gently on
top of the bamboo tree.)

99
00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.128
You know the rice cooked with bamboo trees?

100
00:04:57.828 --> 00:05:01.429
If they are in direct contact with
the fire, they will get burnt.

101
00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.438
It'd be harder to eat them.

102
00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:05.809
Gosh, that looks great.

103
00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.539
- Don't they look nice?
- They do.

104
00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.637
We just need to wait for
these to get cooked.

105
00:05:10.638 --> 00:05:12.358
(The hard cassavas go right into the fire.)

106
00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:15.719
This somewhat looks nice.

107
00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:17.517
It feels like we're on a retreat.

108
00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:20.118
(This unique presentation radiates
organic flavors of jungle.)

109
00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:24.659
(Cho Rong's roasted bananas and cassavas)

110
00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:28.729
(Amazed)

111
00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.827
- That's hot.
- Look at these.

112
00:05:31.828 --> 00:05:33.588
(She exclaims at the
sight of the cassavas.)

113
00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:37.638
- Should we eat this now?
- That's a cassava.

114
00:05:38.198 --> 00:05:39.368
(Swallowing)

115
00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:41.409
- That's cooked.
- That's completely cooked.

116
00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:42.908
Should we peel it with a knife and eat it?

117
00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.837
- Let's eat it.
- I'll prepare it for you.

118
00:05:44.838 --> 00:05:45.908
(Let's eat first.)

119
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.409
Okay. Then let's take a break for snacks.

120
00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:50.619
- Let's stop for a moment.
- I'm starving.

121
00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.049
- This is nice.
- You need to eat in order to work.

122
00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.648
Did you bring the rice wine?

123
00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:56.258
- Rice wine?
- Rice wine?

124
00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:57.958
We're eating snacks.

125
00:05:58.628 --> 00:06:00.428
This looks like a sweet potato.
Look at this.

126
00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:02.397
It's golden brown.

127
00:06:02.398 --> 00:06:04.358
(The steamy cassava is
cooked to a golden brown.)

128
00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.739
(Enjoy the cassava.)

129
00:06:11.068 --> 00:06:12.239
(It's good.)

130
00:06:14.268 --> 00:06:16.148
It's sweet potato. It
tastes like chestnut too.

131
00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:19.678
(He's in a hurry. It's hot.)

132
00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:20.708
It's really good.

133
00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:22.747
This is our first meal of the day, right?

134
00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:24.478
(They feel full and warm
from having snacks.)

135
00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.849
(She's happy.)

136
00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:28.349
There's so much water now.

137
00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.419
- Right.
- It's scary.

138
00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:33.028
I think the water will reach here.

139
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:34.187
(The tide is rising so
the waves are strong.)

140
00:06:34.188 --> 00:06:35.228
Will they?

141
00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.627
(Will they be okay?)

142
00:06:37.628 --> 00:06:38.668
(Snack time is over. They
resume building the house.)

143
00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.728
This might be hard,

144
00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.198
but if we make marks with the saw...

145
00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:46.568
and stick them in, it'll be much stronger.

146
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.978
(They're trying to build
a strong foundation.)

147
00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:50.979
That's right.

148
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.778
(He makes a hole to fit the pillar in.)

149
00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:53.849
This...

150
00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:55.317
(Lifting)

151
00:06:55.318 --> 00:06:57.878
This fixes it.

152
00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.419
- It worked.
- Like this.

153
00:07:00.188 --> 00:07:02.187
We don't have to do that.

154
00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:03.817
Just put some stones here and step on them.

155
00:07:03.818 --> 00:07:04.887
(The foundation is being built
under Moon Sik's leadership.)

156
00:07:04.888 --> 00:07:06.087
Big stones are okay too.

157
00:07:06.088 --> 00:07:07.088
(The foundation is being built
under Moon Sik's leadership.)

158
00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:08.598
This is a real house.

159
00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:09.897
(They're proud of themselves.)

160
00:07:09.898 --> 00:07:11.458
We're descendants of Byung Man.

161
00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:14.067
Push it more this way.

162
00:07:14.068 --> 00:07:15.068
(The roof gets built.)

163
00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.137
That's good.

164
00:07:16.138 --> 00:07:17.437
(They work together.)

165
00:07:17.438 --> 00:07:18.637
(This is good.)

166
00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:19.638
It worked.

167
00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:21.739
- Let's finish in an hour.
- Sure.

168
00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:23.837
Let's do it in an hour.

169
00:07:23.838 --> 00:07:27.708
(They pour their efforts in it.
How will it look?)

170
00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:29.278
Let's stack them up from this side.

171
00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:30.348
(It's time to put the roof up.)

172
00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:33.517
Let's start from here and keep going.

173
00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:35.049
(They lay the banana leaves down.)

174
00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:37.559
This will never fall.

175
00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:41.529
(They tie the poles together
so that they don't move.)

176
00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:43.627
(Hard work never betrays you.)

177
00:07:43.628 --> 00:07:44.628
What happens if we leave them here?

178
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.029
(Hard work never betrays you.)

179
00:07:46.698 --> 00:07:47.799
This is great.

180
00:07:48.838 --> 00:07:51.739
It's much better than what I imagined.

181
00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:54.408
I thought we weren't going
to put so much effort in.

182
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:55.478
(The jungle house gets built nicely
with their combined efforts.)

183
00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:58.039
The Hunting Team is going to get
shocked when they see this.

184
00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:00.707
- It's done.
- Do you think it's enough?

185
00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:03.147
- This is great.
- It's spectacular.

186
00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:04.648
It definitely is.

187
00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:08.247
The bamboo floor will shelter them...

188
00:08:08.248 --> 00:08:09.688
from the cold ground and the bugs.

189
00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:12.457
The sturdy pillars support...

190
00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:14.888
the wide roof made out of banana leaves.

191
00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:18.058
Byung Man's Tribe's spacious home...

192
00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:20.169
has been built.

193
00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:24.698
You built the jungle
house without the Chief.

194
00:08:24.969 --> 00:08:28.577
Moon Sik. He's Byung Man number two.

195
00:08:28.578 --> 00:08:30.738
He's that good in many ways.

196
00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:32.378
"Let's build a house here."

197
00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:34.978
"You do this. You do that."
He assigns you stuff to do.

198
00:08:35.618 --> 00:08:38.947
He was very enthusiastic when
we were building the house.

199
00:08:38.948 --> 00:08:41.617
He was very helpful,

200
00:08:41.618 --> 00:08:44.389
so I just had to follow his lead.

201
00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.888
I fell for Moon Sik's leadership.

202
00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:48.957
(She's drawn by his leadership.)

203
00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:49.998
I'm serious.

204
00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:52.597
Byung Man is so skilled.

205
00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:54.068
I can't copy him.

206
00:08:54.499 --> 00:08:58.399
I was lucky that I got this much done.

207
00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:01.937
- I'm so hungry.
- While they were building,

208
00:09:01.938 --> 00:09:03.338
it got dark.

209
00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:06.648
By the way, where did the Hunting Team go?

210
00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:07.708
What if it gets dark?

211
00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:11.118
(They're returning to the survival zone.)

212
00:09:12.488 --> 00:09:13.889
The tide is rising.

213
00:09:15.289 --> 00:09:16.457
It's dangerous.

214
00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:19.028
(It seems dangerous.)

215
00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:20.129
The tide is rising.

216
00:09:21.488 --> 00:09:22.957
What's going on?

217
00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.399
(They are anxious.)

218
00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:26.669
Look at the waves.

219
00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:29.737
(The water is flooding due
to the incoming waves.)

220
00:09:29.738 --> 00:09:32.338
It's dangerous. It looks cold.

221
00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:37.638
When they were crossing this
river a few hours earlier,

222
00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:40.809
the current was strong but they
could still cross it easily.

223
00:09:42.078 --> 00:09:43.817
- It's dark now...
- It's windy.

224
00:09:43.818 --> 00:09:45.987
And because of the rising
tide and the rough waves,

225
00:09:45.988 --> 00:09:48.149
it's difficult to cross the river.

226
00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:52.087
How will they overcome this obstacle?

227
00:09:52.088 --> 00:09:53.505
(Hunting Team faces another obstacle.)

228
00:09:53.529 --> 00:09:54.588
How do we cross it?

229
00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:56.327
Hold on. Let's have a look.

230
00:09:56.328 --> 00:09:57.328
(They're puzzled.)

231
00:10:00.169 --> 00:10:03.567
(Tae Gon takes a look.)

232
00:10:03.568 --> 00:10:06.107
- The water is so cold.
- Hold on.

233
00:10:06.108 --> 00:10:07.409
It's dangerous for Bo Mi.

234
00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:09.539
We don't know.

235
00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:12.649
It's quite strong.

236
00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:14.549
This is the river.

237
00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:16.347
There's too much water.

238
00:10:16.348 --> 00:10:17.818
(He's worried.)

239
00:10:18.478 --> 00:10:21.289
When it rains, the water grows very fast.

240
00:10:21.718 --> 00:10:24.888
It could be dangerous because of the water.
Not only us,

241
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:27.129
but the staff members too.
We might get isolated.

242
00:10:27.488 --> 00:10:29.028
I was really worried.

243
00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:30.728
(There's not a moment to lose.)

244
00:10:31.968 --> 00:10:34.968
Let's do this. I have a rope.

245
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:38.607
I'll go across first and tie it.
You can hold it and walk across.

246
00:10:38.608 --> 00:10:39.868
Okay.

247
00:10:41.338 --> 00:10:43.408
(Tae Gon is planning to use his rope.)

248
00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:45.977
We have to connect the
ropes and walk across.

249
00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:47.785
(He's planning to connect
both sides of the river.)

250
00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:50.518
(He ties it tightly to one side...)

251
00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:53.617
(and walks across to connect
to the other side.)

252
00:10:53.618 --> 00:10:54.818
Be careful.

253
00:10:57.618 --> 00:11:00.957
(The jungle is even darker now.)

254
00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.429
(The waves are getting rougher.)

255
00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:14.438
(Tae Gon uses his flashlight
to find his way.)

256
00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:19.077
(He slows down.)

257
00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:20.848
- Be careful.
- The current is strong.

258
00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:24.419
(He goes slowly.)

259
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.617
Please don't hurt yourself.

260
00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:27.588
(He takes small steps.)

261
00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:30.659
(It dips in.)

262
00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.759
(The water level drops all of a sudden.)

263
00:11:37.198 --> 00:11:40.098
(It's up to his thighs.)

264
00:11:41.698 --> 00:11:45.467
(He can't see so it's hard
to walk in the water.)

265
00:11:45.468 --> 00:11:46.638
The water's here now.

266
00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.408
(The water's filling up around them.)

267
00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:49.409
It's up to here.

268
00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:55.108
(He's halfway through now.)

269
00:11:57.649 --> 00:12:00.919
(He falters again.)

270
00:12:03.688 --> 00:12:04.788
(The current is getting rougher.)

271
00:12:04.789 --> 00:12:06.458
The water is so strong.

272
00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:13.499
(The others are very worried.)

273
00:12:15.698 --> 00:12:17.968
(Fumbling)

274
00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:22.379
(It's tough for him and he's fit.)

275
00:12:23.938 --> 00:12:26.848
(He finally reaches the other side.)

276
00:12:28.249 --> 00:12:32.048
(He gets on land...)

277
00:12:32.049 --> 00:12:34.548
(and looks for a spot to tie the rope.)

278
00:12:34.549 --> 00:12:35.869
Did the rope get stuck somewhere?

279
00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:38.088
- It didn't.
- It didn't.

280
00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:40.159
It's not enough.

281
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.258
(The rope is too short.)

282
00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:43.358
It's not enough.

283
00:12:46.429 --> 00:12:47.867
Goodness.

284
00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:49.668
(The water rushes in.)

285
00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:50.738
This is so scary.

286
00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:54.269
- It's so strong.
- It's rushing in.

287
00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:58.379
- My goodness.
- Take our bags.

288
00:12:58.948 --> 00:13:02.078
(There's no safe zone anymore.)

289
00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.178
How is this possible?

290
00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:05.448
I was shocked.

291
00:13:06.289 --> 00:13:07.318
The water...

292
00:13:08.249 --> 00:13:10.987
rushed in all of a sudden.

293
00:13:10.988 --> 00:13:12.789
I got scared.

294
00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:17.578
- I'm so scared.
- You have to be careful of the sea.

295
00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:19.299
It'll swallow you.

296
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:23.198
(Meanwhile, at the jungle house)

297
00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:26.838
(Shrieking)

298
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:30.737
(The water reaches their feet.)

299
00:13:30.738 --> 00:13:33.208
What's this? It came this far?

300
00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:36.948
This is emergency.

301
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.649
(That was totally unexpected.)

302
00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:40.018
Look at that.

303
00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:43.457
(The waves lurk near their jungle house.)

304
00:13:43.458 --> 00:13:44.458
It came this far.

305
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.789
This is shocking.

306
00:13:48.488 --> 00:13:52.769
What if we can't sleep in our house?
We worked so hard on it.

307
00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:54.169
What do we do?

308
00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:01.338
(Tae Gon is trying to tie
the rope to a fallen tree.)

309
00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:06.809
Can we come?

310
00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:09.748
(The safety rope is ready.)

311
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:10.779
You can come across.

312
00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:13.079
He said we can come. Let's go.

313
00:14:14.818 --> 00:14:15.818
Be careful.

314
00:14:15.819 --> 00:14:17.118
(Stumbling)

315
00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:19.587
- Look down.
- Okay.

316
00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:20.789
(Safety first)

317
00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:23.499
It's deep.

318
00:14:25.929 --> 00:14:27.028
Put it in your armpit.

319
00:14:27.029 --> 00:14:29.337
(The three of them move slowly
with the rope in their hands.)

320
00:14:29.338 --> 00:14:30.398
Be careful.

321
00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:32.368
I'll lift it up. Go slowly.

322
00:14:32.568 --> 00:14:33.738
Okay. Thank you.

323
00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:37.509
(Tae Gon shines the light
in front of them.)

324
00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.708
There's a big rock.

325
00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:43.548
Be careful.

326
00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.488
(Yun Hyeong stumbles.)

327
00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:51.687
It was dark so we couldn't see the floor.

328
00:14:51.688 --> 00:14:54.458
It was slippery too.
Some parts dipped down.

329
00:14:54.929 --> 00:14:56.857
We couldn't see anything,

330
00:14:56.858 --> 00:14:58.868
so we relied on the rope.

331
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:02.438
The current is strong.

332
00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:05.268
It was deep too,

333
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:07.008
but the current was really strong.

334
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:09.438
We couldn't move forward
without the safety rope.

335
00:15:13.049 --> 00:15:14.548
The current is so strong.

336
00:15:14.549 --> 00:15:17.029
(They have a rope but they're
swaying because of the current.)

337
00:15:19.948 --> 00:15:21.888
(Splashing)

338
00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:22.988
Be careful.

339
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:26.587
(Dam loses balance and falls.)

340
00:15:26.588 --> 00:15:28.429
Are you okay, Dam?

341
00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:29.958
What is it?

342
00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:35.867
(He didn't lose the rope
so he gets back up.)

343
00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.899
(That was close.)

344
00:15:39.368 --> 00:15:41.508
It's so much better with the rope.

345
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:43.337
(They reach the other side safely.)

346
00:15:43.338 --> 00:15:44.379
Come here.

347
00:15:47.478 --> 00:15:50.478
(Dam finishes crossing last.)

348
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:54.149
You saved us. This was our life line.

349
00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.258
It was so hard tying the rope.

350
00:15:57.259 --> 00:15:58.518
(It's time for the staff members to cross.)

351
00:15:58.519 --> 00:15:59.558
(The water grew even more.)

352
00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:00.559
There's so much water now.

353
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.587
(The water grew even more.)

354
00:16:01.588 --> 00:16:02.698
Who's left?

355
00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:04.727
(They can't be relieved yet.)

356
00:16:04.728 --> 00:16:06.499
There's one cameraman.

357
00:16:07.698 --> 00:16:10.398
(The staff holds onto the
safety rope to cross.)

358
00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.597
Come slowly.

359
00:16:11.598 --> 00:16:13.518
(The staff holds onto the
safety rope to cross.)

360
00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:17.179
(Staggering)

361
00:16:18.909 --> 00:16:19.909
Come closer.

362
00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:20.909
(He is the last person to cross.)

363
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.378
Be careful. Walk slowly.

364
00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:26.088
(A cameraman is crossing
with a camera in his hand.)

365
00:16:27.718 --> 00:16:30.658
(A big wave rolls in.)

366
00:16:30.659 --> 00:16:31.957
There's a wave rolling in.

367
00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.788
(The cameraman staggers
because of the wave.)

368
00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:36.398
- Stop there for a moment.
- Stop and start walking again.

369
00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:37.457
(He tries hard to protect the camera.)

370
00:16:37.458 --> 00:16:38.698
It's dangerous.

371
00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.938
Step back. This is dangerous.

372
00:16:42.238 --> 00:16:45.039
(Waves are coming in from every direction.)

373
00:16:46.368 --> 00:16:48.408
(Groaning)

374
00:16:48.409 --> 00:16:49.409
(Ahn Hyo Il, Cameraman)

375
00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:50.878
Walk slowly.

376
00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:53.548
(Tae Gon walks over to help him.)

377
00:16:53.549 --> 00:16:56.679
(The cameraman starts moving carefully.)

378
00:16:57.948 --> 00:16:59.187
The water is rising fast.

379
00:16:59.188 --> 00:17:01.218
(The water rose waist-high.)

380
00:17:01.318 --> 00:17:02.358
Okay.

381
00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:04.318
(Tae Gon grabs the cameraman.)

382
00:17:05.928 --> 00:17:08.559
(The distance left is 5m!)

383
00:17:10.428 --> 00:17:12.567
(Everyone successfully crosses over!)

384
00:17:12.568 --> 00:17:15.199
That was dangerous. Everyone's here, right?

385
00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.167
I'm alive! We're alive.

386
00:17:18.168 --> 00:17:19.408
- I'm alive.
- We're back.

387
00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:20.709
We're alive.

388
00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:22.539
Let's go.

389
00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.509
Tae Gon should go back and untie the rope.

390
00:17:27.108 --> 00:17:29.218
(Hey!)

391
00:17:29.219 --> 00:17:32.218
(The Tribe finally laughs.)

392
00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:34.249
(I'm glad nothing happened.)

393
00:17:34.719 --> 00:17:35.959
All right. Let's go.

394
00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:37.917
Thanks to Tae Gon's
knowledge and experience,

395
00:17:37.918 --> 00:17:40.458
the Tribe and the staff
crossed the river safely.

396
00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:41.459
(Everyone has safely crossed the river.)

397
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.627
The shelter-building team that
was startled by the waves...

398
00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:46.999
start building a temporary seawall.

399
00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:50.238
- Where?
- Here.

400
00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:52.039
(They try to stop the
waves with a huge log.)

401
00:17:52.168 --> 00:17:53.308
1, 2, 3.

402
00:17:53.309 --> 00:17:55.138
(Heave-ho)

403
00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:56.709
- This is good.
- Good.

404
00:17:57.578 --> 00:17:59.177
This will work, right?

405
00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:00.509
It'll stop the waves here.

406
00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:05.917
(They pile the sand to make a hump, )

407
00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:08.918
(and they also dig a waterway.)

408
00:18:12.928 --> 00:18:14.888
(The waves are rolling in again.)

409
00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:16.959
(Startled)

410
00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:18.799
Gosh, that scared me.

411
00:18:23.068 --> 00:18:25.039
(The waves came all the way to the log.)

412
00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:29.178
Without this, the waves
would've came in all the way.

413
00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:32.078
The timing was perfect.

414
00:18:34.209 --> 00:18:35.978
It would've been dangerous without this.

415
00:18:35.979 --> 00:18:38.848
(The sea looks menacing.
I hope nothing happens.)

416
00:18:40.049 --> 00:18:41.218
Goodness.

417
00:18:41.219 --> 00:18:42.458
You're back.

418
00:18:42.459 --> 00:18:44.218
- Welcome back.
- Good work.

419
00:18:44.219 --> 00:18:46.288
Gosh. There was no fish.

420
00:18:46.289 --> 00:18:47.489
No worries.

421
00:18:47.989 --> 00:18:49.199
I couldn't see anything.

422
00:18:49.499 --> 00:18:50.758
- Nothing?
- You didn't catch anything?

423
00:18:50.759 --> 00:18:52.167
- Nothing.
- Really?

424
00:18:52.168 --> 00:18:53.228
(They had high expectation.)

425
00:18:53.229 --> 00:18:54.298
There was no fish.

426
00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:56.168
We couldn't see anything in the water.

427
00:18:56.439 --> 00:18:59.567
The water is too cold. I
couldn't even see my hand.

428
00:18:59.568 --> 00:19:01.907
- You tried.
- You couldn't see any fish?

429
00:19:01.908 --> 00:19:03.078
- No.
- Banana.

430
00:19:03.578 --> 00:19:05.778
Take a banana.

431
00:19:05.779 --> 00:19:07.809
Eat a banana.

432
00:19:08.078 --> 00:19:09.377
(Good work.)

433
00:19:09.378 --> 00:19:10.479
- It's hot.
- Take one.

434
00:19:10.648 --> 00:19:11.749
Thank you.

435
00:19:13.449 --> 00:19:14.688
(Taking a bite)

436
00:19:14.689 --> 00:19:15.958
- Eat a banana.
- He gave me one.

437
00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:17.958
- Eat this.
- It's hot.

438
00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:19.627
(It melts in her mouth.)

439
00:19:19.628 --> 00:19:20.935
- Gosh.
- How come it's so delicious?

440
00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:22.397
Why is this so delicious?

441
00:19:22.398 --> 00:19:23.459
(Thumbs up)

442
00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:30.097
(The hunting team fill their empty
stomachs with roasted banana.)

443
00:19:30.098 --> 00:19:31.799
- It's good.
- Isn't it?

444
00:19:31.969 --> 00:19:34.468
Do we need to survive with
cassava and banana tonight?

445
00:19:34.469 --> 00:19:35.509
We should go fishing.

446
00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:38.778
We'll regroup and catch eels.

447
00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:40.049
Let's go catch eels.

448
00:19:41.148 --> 00:19:43.877
- It's raining again.
- Goodness.

449
00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:44.948
(It's raining harder.)

450
00:19:44.949 --> 00:19:46.417
We'll be in trouble if the fire dies.

451
00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:47.749
(They need to protect the fire.)

452
00:19:48.858 --> 00:19:50.219
Let's erect a pillar.

453
00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:51.989
Put a poncho over it.

454
00:19:52.289 --> 00:19:55.258
Let's cut this in half and connect it.

455
00:19:55.259 --> 00:19:56.939
(They're using a plastic sheet as a tent.)

456
00:19:57.959 --> 00:20:00.098
(Taping)

457
00:20:00.898 --> 00:20:02.239
Hurry up. The fire is dying.

458
00:20:04.499 --> 00:20:06.137
- We got a hole here.
- There's a hole.

459
00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:07.907
(They put a bamboo in the center...)

460
00:20:07.908 --> 00:20:08.908
It's done.

461
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:09.938
(and put it over the
fire like an umbrella.)

462
00:20:09.939 --> 00:20:11.408
Put it up straight.

463
00:20:12.309 --> 00:20:14.449
(He ties it down tightly with a rope.)

464
00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:17.479
(Tying it hard)

465
00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:18.618
Good.

466
00:20:19.289 --> 00:20:20.587
The fire's still alive.

467
00:20:20.588 --> 00:20:22.188
(They built a tent to protect the fire.)

468
00:20:22.519 --> 00:20:23.587
Put it over.

469
00:20:23.588 --> 00:20:24.588
(They're strengthening the shelter.)

470
00:20:24.589 --> 00:20:26.189
Let's see.

471
00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:27.958
- Get the end.
- Line it up.

472
00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:29.427
(They're hoping it's waterproof.)

473
00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:31.058
- This is it.
- I got it.

474
00:20:31.059 --> 00:20:32.097
- This is the end.
- Tae Gon.

475
00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:33.198
- I got it.
- You got it?

476
00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:34.199
Yes, it's done.

477
00:20:34.328 --> 00:20:35.439
Gosh, it's cold.

478
00:20:36.699 --> 00:20:38.199
I'm all soaked.

479
00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:41.368
(She's super tired.)

480
00:20:42.578 --> 00:20:45.408
Honestly, I thought The Law
of Jungle would be easy.

481
00:20:45.648 --> 00:20:46.749
But it's really difficult.

482
00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.778
I realized it here.

483
00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:51.449
They told me we're having it easy today.

484
00:20:51.578 --> 00:20:54.689
They don't give us anything. It's real.

485
00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:57.719
The jungle changes rapidly.
We can't predict it.

486
00:20:58.318 --> 00:21:00.489
The Tribe won't stay put though.

487
00:21:00.928 --> 00:21:03.128
It's time to go out and collect food.

488
00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:07.268
- We'll go now.
- Team Eel.

489
00:21:07.269 --> 00:21:08.637
- Be careful.
- Take care.

490
00:21:08.638 --> 00:21:09.668
- Good luck!
- Go!

491
00:21:09.969 --> 00:21:11.739
What are we going to do?

492
00:21:11.908 --> 00:21:13.809
- We'll catch crabs.
- Crabs.

493
00:21:14.309 --> 00:21:16.009
We'll catch boars, if there are boars.

494
00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:17.638
Land animals.

495
00:21:18.108 --> 00:21:19.108
Let's go.

496
00:21:19.109 --> 00:21:20.607
- Good luck.
- It's our only hope.

497
00:21:20.608 --> 00:21:22.077
- Eels.
- Let's do a cheer.

498
00:21:22.078 --> 00:21:23.417
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

499
00:21:23.418 --> 00:21:25.249
- Eels, let's go!
- Eels, let's go!

500
00:21:25.888 --> 00:21:27.688
(They do a cheer for a successful hunt.)

501
00:21:27.689 --> 00:21:29.189
- Let's go.
- Okay.

502
00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:30.458
Good luck.

503
00:21:30.459 --> 00:21:31.579
(They hope for a big catch.)

504
00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:33.789
They might not be able to catch eels.

505
00:21:34.158 --> 00:21:35.397
- I feel like they can't.
- It feels like that.

506
00:21:35.398 --> 00:21:37.058
We'll have to catch something.

507
00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:38.729
Eels aren't easy to catch actually.

508
00:21:38.999 --> 00:21:40.897
We could be the winner.

509
00:21:40.898 --> 00:21:42.138
We have to be the winner.

510
00:21:42.338 --> 00:21:44.539
- Let's do it!
- Let's go.

511
00:21:45.098 --> 00:21:47.338
- Go!
- Let's go!

512
00:21:50.439 --> 00:21:52.177
When you shine the flashlight,

513
00:21:52.178 --> 00:21:55.979
sometimes squid and octopus come up.

514
00:21:56.678 --> 00:21:57.748
Be careful.

515
00:21:57.749 --> 00:22:00.117
(They check the sea near their shelter.)

516
00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:01.888
Please, something edible.

517
00:22:02.658 --> 00:22:04.158
Kang Nam, you saw fish earlier?

518
00:22:04.658 --> 00:22:05.658
There are fish here.

519
00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:06.888
(They're moving consistently.)

520
00:22:08.959 --> 00:22:10.528
Hey, I found something we can eat.

521
00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:12.168
- What is it?
- Gastropod.

522
00:22:12.729 --> 00:22:13.769
Look.

523
00:22:14.368 --> 00:22:16.344
It's delicious when you boil it.
There are so many.

524
00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:18.538
- Amazing.
- This.

525
00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:20.208
You see it, right?

526
00:22:20.209 --> 00:22:21.638
It's delicious when you boil it.

527
00:22:23.479 --> 00:22:25.347
It tastes good to suck on it.

528
00:22:25.348 --> 00:22:27.478
- What is it?
- There's more.

529
00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:28.847
- You see it, right?
- What is this?

530
00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:30.518
- That's it.
- What is this?

531
00:22:30.519 --> 00:22:32.088
Okay. They're all gastropods.

532
00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.719
- Right here.
- They're too tiny.

533
00:22:36.918 --> 00:22:37.988
(Let's just get them first.)

534
00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:39.689
- No.
- Yes, pick it up like that.

535
00:22:40.128 --> 00:22:42.999
This one has some meat. You can eat it.

536
00:22:43.398 --> 00:22:45.299
- Where is it?
- It's on the rock.

537
00:22:45.868 --> 00:22:47.397
Can't we eat the ones that are stuck?

538
00:22:47.398 --> 00:22:49.269
(They move toward the sea.)

539
00:22:49.898 --> 00:22:50.898
Here it is.

540
00:22:52.168 --> 00:22:53.568
Let's get these. They're good.

541
00:22:53.769 --> 00:22:55.008
They're on the rock.

542
00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:56.279
They look delicious.

543
00:22:59.309 --> 00:23:00.708
(The waves roll in from behind.)

544
00:23:00.709 --> 00:23:01.918
Gosh, it's cold!

545
00:23:03.618 --> 00:23:04.648
(Startled)

546
00:23:05.418 --> 00:23:07.488
Be careful.

547
00:23:07.489 --> 00:23:08.587
(The water rises up all of a sudden.)

548
00:23:08.588 --> 00:23:10.019
- What do I do?
- Come out.

549
00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:12.628
- What do I do?
- Water's coming in.

550
00:23:12.989 --> 00:23:14.758
Be careful. Come out.

551
00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:16.729
(Tide comes in without a warning.)

552
00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:18.059
Let's get out.

553
00:23:18.398 --> 00:23:19.968
(The beach is already immersed in water.)

554
00:23:19.969 --> 00:23:21.269
Let's get out.

555
00:23:23.098 --> 00:23:24.699
- It's crazy.
- It's dangerous.

556
00:23:25.969 --> 00:23:27.038
(Cho Rong's worried about Bo Mi.)

557
00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.138
I'm okay.

558
00:23:29.009 --> 00:23:30.337
- Dam.
- What's going on?

559
00:23:30.338 --> 00:23:32.248
Bo Mi. Grab his hand.

560
00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:34.077
- Be careful.
- That scared me.

561
00:23:34.078 --> 00:23:35.147
(Everyone gets out of the water.)

562
00:23:35.148 --> 00:23:36.279
That scared me.

563
00:23:36.449 --> 00:23:37.948
Good. We all got out.

564
00:23:37.949 --> 00:23:39.689
We shouldn't let our guards down.

565
00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:41.648
- Amazing.
- That startled me.

566
00:23:41.848 --> 00:23:42.989
The water rose so quickly.

567
00:23:43.289 --> 00:23:44.658
We shouldn't let our guards down.

568
00:23:46.229 --> 00:23:48.998
(They collected quite a bit of gastropods.)

569
00:23:48.999 --> 00:23:51.358
We'll be able to boil soup.

570
00:23:51.999 --> 00:23:53.597
The waves are so strong.

571
00:23:53.598 --> 00:23:55.199
(The night sea is scary.)

572
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:56.269
It's dangerous.

573
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.398
Let's go over there.

574
00:23:57.799 --> 00:23:59.269
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

575
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:01.567
- What is it?
- Gosh.

576
00:24:01.568 --> 00:24:04.209
- I'm sorry. A frog...
- Is there a frog?

577
00:24:04.678 --> 00:24:06.648
Why do I keep spotting frogs?

578
00:24:07.949 --> 00:24:10.749
(Soon after that...)

579
00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:12.449
- Gosh.
- What is it?

580
00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.887
- What's wrong?
- Why do I keep spotting frogs?

581
00:24:13.888 --> 00:24:14.918
- What?
- Frog?

582
00:24:15.219 --> 00:24:17.288
You're good at spotting them.
I don't see them.

583
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:18.289
(Where are they?)

584
00:24:18.489 --> 00:24:19.758
(Cameraman can't find it either.)

585
00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:21.759
We don't see them. How
are you spotting frogs?

586
00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:25.098
Wherever I shine my light, there's a frog.

587
00:24:25.699 --> 00:24:27.419
When you're startled, it's because of frog.

588
00:24:28.699 --> 00:24:30.068
Bo Mi, my heart is racing.

589
00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:33.809
- Frog...
- Don't look. Walk straight.

590
00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:35.309
Why?

591
00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:38.077
(They think they're done with the frogs.)

592
00:24:38.078 --> 00:24:40.548
- Gosh, Cho Rong. Come here.
- What?

593
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:41.648
- No.
- Gosh.

594
00:24:42.678 --> 00:24:43.719
(Shaking her head)

595
00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:45.348
- Amazing.
- Where?

596
00:24:45.388 --> 00:24:46.689
- There.
- A frog?

597
00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:48.518
It's like a gold frog.

598
00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:51.958
- Cho Rong. You should see that.
- No.

599
00:24:51.959 --> 00:24:53.729
- You should go first.
- Here.

600
00:24:54.189 --> 00:24:55.698
- You should go first.
- Here.

601
00:24:55.699 --> 00:24:56.758
(He's a professional.)

602
00:24:56.759 --> 00:24:58.028
You should film it.

603
00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:59.349
- No.
- You have to come in here.

604
00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:00.867
(Screaming)

605
00:25:00.868 --> 00:25:02.199
- But this is...
- Gosh.

606
00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:04.338
- Isn't it amazing?
- Why are you screaming?

607
00:25:04.598 --> 00:25:05.985
- You didn't even see it yet.
- You...

608
00:25:06.009 --> 00:25:07.039
What is it?

609
00:25:07.509 --> 00:25:08.708
(There are toads everywhere.)

610
00:25:08.709 --> 00:25:09.939
Goodness.

611
00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:13.209
She reacts so differently every time.

612
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:15.208
I thought there was only one reaction.

613
00:25:15.209 --> 00:25:16.878
There are four here.

614
00:25:16.979 --> 00:25:18.347
- No.
- There are four?

615
00:25:18.348 --> 00:25:20.088
The size is...

616
00:25:20.249 --> 00:25:21.817
Why are you so scared of toads?

617
00:25:21.818 --> 00:25:23.118
I'm...

618
00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:25.828
I can't even go near it.

619
00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:30.058
But I was able to walk that path.

620
00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:31.799
I felt like I became stronger.

621
00:25:32.469 --> 00:25:34.798
"I'm walking down this way."

622
00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:37.398
I guess it's because I saw so many toads...

623
00:25:37.499 --> 00:25:39.068
- There's a toad!
- No.

624
00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:41.209
Come on.

625
00:25:43.209 --> 00:25:45.008
Don't you think we can eat it?

626
00:25:45.009 --> 00:25:47.308
(Next to Cho Ron who is frozen...)

627
00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:49.718
Let's get the frogs.

628
00:25:49.719 --> 00:25:50.948
No, we can't it them.

629
00:25:50.949 --> 00:25:52.018
(Bo Mi is ready to attack.)

630
00:25:52.019 --> 00:25:53.318
You're in the same group, right?

631
00:25:54.749 --> 00:25:56.158
Can't we eat a moth?

632
00:25:56.489 --> 00:25:58.588
If you eat it, you'll be the first.

633
00:26:01.088 --> 00:26:03.199
Can't we eat these?

634
00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:08.597
It looks like a jujube.

635
00:26:08.598 --> 00:26:09.668
(Too bad.)

636
00:26:10.699 --> 00:26:12.638
I guess we don't eat everything.

637
00:26:12.809 --> 00:26:14.008
(What is she talking about?)

638
00:26:14.009 --> 00:26:16.838
I thought we would eat everything we find.

639
00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:20.808
- Let's go in the back.
- Caterpillars can be eaten.

640
00:26:20.809 --> 00:26:23.448
We need to look for crabs on the ground...

641
00:26:23.449 --> 00:26:24.449
(I want to find something.)

642
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.888
and fruits on the trees.

643
00:26:27.818 --> 00:26:30.158
We also need to look for
cassavas and taros.

644
00:26:30.219 --> 00:26:31.417
Why did you kick it?

645
00:26:31.418 --> 00:26:32.938
I wondered if something will come out.

646
00:26:34.628 --> 00:26:37.627
- Really?
- She is in a bad mood.

647
00:26:37.628 --> 00:26:42.469
They will have to find food
soon for the hungry Bo Mi.

648
00:26:43.699 --> 00:26:48.309
Meanwhile, the other team arrived
at the fishing point for eels.

649
00:26:49.378 --> 00:26:51.509
We will be able to catch eels.

650
00:26:52.648 --> 00:26:53.949
We need to catch eels.

651
00:26:55.519 --> 00:26:56.549
Isn't that shrimp?

652
00:26:57.019 --> 00:26:58.948
- Where?
- I see a pair of eyes.

653
00:26:58.949 --> 00:27:00.518
- It's shrimp.
- Shrimp.

654
00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:02.019
Catch the shrimp.

655
00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:04.959
- Look at those orange eyes.
- It's shrimp.

656
00:27:05.489 --> 00:27:06.529
Shine the flashlight.

657
00:27:06.729 --> 00:27:08.427
Let me catch this shrimp.

658
00:27:08.428 --> 00:27:10.228
The orange light belongs to the shrimp.

659
00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:13.127
(He approaches it carefully.)

660
00:27:13.128 --> 00:27:16.097
(He is looking for the perfect timing.)

661
00:27:16.098 --> 00:27:17.268
(It slides out...)

662
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:18.368
(like water.)

663
00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:21.637
(Jumping)

664
00:27:21.638 --> 00:27:23.607
(It annoys people.)

665
00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:26.377
(He drops the lantern in frustration.)

666
00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:28.377
(Embarrassed)

667
00:27:28.378 --> 00:27:30.078
(Only a fly stays with him.)

668
00:27:30.848 --> 00:27:32.989
- Shall we go somewhere else?
- What is that?

669
00:27:33.949 --> 00:27:34.988
It's a leaf.

670
00:27:34.989 --> 00:27:36.259
Let's look around the place.

671
00:27:36.959 --> 00:27:39.289
We can go further up too.

672
00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:40.827
All right.

673
00:27:40.828 --> 00:27:42.897
(He goes up the river and
tries to hunt again.)

674
00:27:42.898 --> 00:27:44.627
(He concentrates.)

675
00:27:44.628 --> 00:27:46.128
It's really big.

676
00:27:46.969 --> 00:27:48.327
(Jumping)

677
00:27:48.328 --> 00:27:50.597
(He puts his head inside the water, )

678
00:27:50.598 --> 00:27:52.137
It's really fast.

679
00:27:52.138 --> 00:27:53.138
(but the shrimp is gone.)

680
00:27:56.209 --> 00:27:58.607
(He is half a tempo slow.)

681
00:27:58.608 --> 00:28:01.948
(He keeps dropping the lantern.)

682
00:28:01.949 --> 00:28:03.549
(His hands always come up empty.)

683
00:28:05.449 --> 00:28:08.249
In the countryside, we
make shrimp pass out...

684
00:28:08.348 --> 00:28:09.918
in order to catch it.

685
00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:11.688
(He grabs a rock...)

686
00:28:11.689 --> 00:28:13.529
(to splash water.)

687
00:28:15.088 --> 00:28:19.097
(He grabs a stick...)

688
00:28:19.098 --> 00:28:20.698
(to slap water.)

689
00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:22.199
It's lucky.

690
00:28:24.739 --> 00:28:27.368
Since there are small ones,
there are bound to be big ones.

691
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:29.539
There it is.

692
00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:31.279
It hid.

693
00:28:32.848 --> 00:28:34.377
It looks fascinating. Is it shrimp?

694
00:28:34.378 --> 00:28:36.648
This one has pincers.

695
00:28:37.719 --> 00:28:38.719
Is it crayfish?

696
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.848
(It looks strong.)

697
00:28:40.588 --> 00:28:41.618
Does it bite?

698
00:28:42.189 --> 00:28:45.118
When I put my hand near it,
it approached to bite.

699
00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:46.659
- Did it approach your hand?
- Yes.

700
00:28:47.729 --> 00:28:49.258
This is hard.

701
00:28:49.259 --> 00:28:50.699
(They are standing face to face.)

702
00:28:52.828 --> 00:28:54.498
(He gathers his courage.)

703
00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:55.637
(Touch down)

704
00:28:55.638 --> 00:28:56.738
- Did you catch it?
- Yes.

705
00:28:56.739 --> 00:28:58.668
What is it? Is it crayfish?

706
00:28:59.108 --> 00:29:01.167
I am afraid it will jump
out when I open my hand.

707
00:29:01.168 --> 00:29:02.678
It won't bite.

708
00:29:02.709 --> 00:29:04.138
Do we have a pouch?

709
00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:08.248
Do we have a pouch? A net?

710
00:29:08.249 --> 00:29:11.348
Put your lantern down for a
second to use the other hand.

711
00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:13.718
Gosh, I didn't catch it.

712
00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:15.559
(He opens his hand.)

713
00:29:16.858 --> 00:29:18.317
For goodness' sake.

714
00:29:18.318 --> 00:29:19.988
(I was completely fooled.)

715
00:29:19.989 --> 00:29:21.059
(Embarrassed)

716
00:29:22.729 --> 00:29:23.897
There are fish.

717
00:29:23.898 --> 00:29:26.167
(Yun Hyeong came farther up the river.)

718
00:29:26.168 --> 00:29:27.198
Is that shrimp?

719
00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:29.268
(He finds mini shrimp.)

720
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:30.269
There are two shrimp.

721
00:29:30.999 --> 00:29:34.107
You see its antennae, right?

722
00:29:34.108 --> 00:29:35.709
Are these antennae?

723
00:29:35.979 --> 00:29:37.209
How should I catch it?

724
00:29:37.239 --> 00:29:38.847
My goodness.

725
00:29:38.848 --> 00:29:39.978
(Yun Hyeong is nervous about
catching its antennae.)

726
00:29:39.979 --> 00:29:41.077
(Pressing)

727
00:29:41.078 --> 00:29:42.078
(The veteran cameraman helps him.)

728
00:29:42.079 --> 00:29:44.848
Now, lift up the rock. I am sorry.

729
00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:46.518
It wasn't shrimp. I am sorry.

730
00:29:46.519 --> 00:29:48.189
It's not shrimp.

731
00:29:48.449 --> 00:29:49.519
The other one hid.

732
00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:52.628
What should I do? Wait, there it is.

733
00:29:52.989 --> 00:29:54.028
All right.

734
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:55.189
(I won't hesitate this time.)

735
00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:58.968
(He moves in.)

736
00:29:58.969 --> 00:29:59.969
(Grabbing)

737
00:30:01.068 --> 00:30:02.269
I don't know if I caught it.

738
00:30:02.699 --> 00:30:04.167
(Wriggling)

739
00:30:04.168 --> 00:30:05.508
- I caught it.
- Did you catch it?

740
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:06.738
I caught it. I can feel it.

741
00:30:06.739 --> 00:30:07.779
- Did you catch it?
- Yes.

742
00:30:09.108 --> 00:30:10.239
This is how it feels.

743
00:30:10.939 --> 00:30:12.848
It's only one shrimp,

744
00:30:13.709 --> 00:30:14.749
but it feels great.

745
00:30:15.878 --> 00:30:17.748
It's my first catch.

746
00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:19.029
(It's Yun Hyeong's first catch.)

747
00:30:19.189 --> 00:30:20.219
Don't run away.

748
00:30:21.618 --> 00:30:22.618
There it is.

749
00:30:22.619 --> 00:30:26.529
(There is nothing here.)

750
00:30:27.189 --> 00:30:28.189
What happened?

751
00:30:28.959 --> 00:30:29.959
I swear it was here.

752
00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:30.959
(Am I dreaming?)

753
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.999
(Their luck falls short of their passion.)

754
00:30:33.328 --> 00:30:35.044
- Maybe you were mistaken.
- What happened?

755
00:30:35.068 --> 00:30:36.738
(The three of them get played by shrimp.)

756
00:30:36.739 --> 00:30:37.969
I felt it.

757
00:30:38.739 --> 00:30:42.377
(The master of fishing, Tae Gon
is searching for his prey.)

758
00:30:42.378 --> 00:30:44.338
I will find something if
I search the area later.

759
00:30:48.148 --> 00:30:50.549
It's between the rocks.

760
00:30:51.878 --> 00:30:52.918
Do you see it?

761
00:30:53.348 --> 00:30:56.218
(Carefully)

762
00:30:56.219 --> 00:30:57.388
(Is it a bullet?)

763
00:30:59.928 --> 00:31:02.097
(I can't catch it with bare hands.)

764
00:31:02.098 --> 00:31:04.259
This is driving me crazy.
I felt it with my hands.

765
00:31:05.928 --> 00:31:06.928
(He finds the shrimp again.)

766
00:31:06.929 --> 00:31:09.367
Here it is. Hold on.

767
00:31:09.368 --> 00:31:10.498
(He approaches it with a
harpoon in his hand.)

768
00:31:10.499 --> 00:31:11.539
I found it.

769
00:31:12.138 --> 00:31:13.239
See? It's right there.

770
00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:15.878
I will catch it.

771
00:31:17.908 --> 00:31:19.008
(He prepares the harpoon.)

772
00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:20.049
Did you see it jump?

773
00:31:20.749 --> 00:31:22.624
It's exhausting to have a
war of nerves with it.

774
00:31:22.648 --> 00:31:24.049
It jumped into the air.

775
00:31:24.618 --> 00:31:25.888
You can't run away.

776
00:31:28.148 --> 00:31:29.158
(Hitting)

777
00:31:30.689 --> 00:31:32.458
(The harpoon lands like an arrow.)

778
00:31:32.459 --> 00:31:34.528
(How did it go?)

779
00:31:34.529 --> 00:31:36.699
(He succeeded in catching
the first shrimp.)

780
00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:39.799
How incredible!

781
00:31:40.328 --> 00:31:41.328
What is it?

782
00:31:41.329 --> 00:31:43.137
(Shouting)

783
00:31:43.138 --> 00:31:45.097
- How! It's big shrimp.
- Is there an eel?

784
00:31:45.098 --> 00:31:46.438
(Oriental river shrimp)

785
00:31:46.439 --> 00:31:48.678
I told you there is shrimp.

786
00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:52.448
- He caught it with a harpoon.
- I guess a tool is a must.

787
00:31:52.449 --> 00:31:54.278
Where should we put it?

788
00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:55.548
(Catch shrimp with a harpoon.)

789
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:56.578
That's incredible.

790
00:31:59.749 --> 00:32:00.749
I caught it.

791
00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:05.117
(The harpoon is faster than the shrimp.)

792
00:32:05.118 --> 00:32:06.258
I caught another one.

793
00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:07.379
Hurry up and take a picture.

794
00:32:07.529 --> 00:32:10.628
(He gets his picture taken to
celebrate the successful hunt.)

795
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:14.199
I had my eyes on it.

796
00:32:15.638 --> 00:32:18.269
There are a lot of fish.

797
00:32:18.868 --> 00:32:19.908
I want to catch them.

798
00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:22.177
(I will catch something too.)

799
00:32:22.178 --> 00:32:23.637
It's a big one.

800
00:32:23.638 --> 00:32:25.177
(They can spot shrimp very easily now.)

801
00:32:25.178 --> 00:32:26.248
Slowly.

802
00:32:26.249 --> 00:32:28.578
- How will I catch it?
- Aim carefully.

803
00:32:29.019 --> 00:32:30.019
There it is.

804
00:32:30.449 --> 00:32:31.847
(He aims.)

805
00:32:31.848 --> 00:32:32.848
My goodness.

806
00:32:33.348 --> 00:32:34.387
(He is in haste.)

807
00:32:34.388 --> 00:32:35.388
My goodness.

808
00:32:35.459 --> 00:32:37.088
- Go slowly.
- Go slowly.

809
00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:39.158
(Twinkling)

810
00:32:40.088 --> 00:32:41.088
(Shooting)

811
00:32:41.089 --> 00:32:42.127
I caught it!

812
00:32:42.128 --> 00:32:44.229
(He finally succeeded.)

813
00:32:44.928 --> 00:32:45.928
You did it.

814
00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:49.597
My goodness, that's incredible.

815
00:32:49.598 --> 00:32:51.068
Gosh, that startled me.

816
00:32:53.709 --> 00:32:55.039
I now know how to catch shrimp.

817
00:32:55.638 --> 00:32:57.009
There it is.

818
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:58.607
(He never misses his target.)

819
00:32:58.608 --> 00:33:01.378
I caught it! Lucky!

820
00:33:02.878 --> 00:33:05.618
This is incredible. I got lucky.

821
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:07.549
I caught a big one.

822
00:33:07.989 --> 00:33:09.087
There it is.

823
00:33:09.088 --> 00:33:11.058
(It's Yun Hyeong's show time.)

824
00:33:11.059 --> 00:33:12.857
(His aim was a bit off.)

825
00:33:12.858 --> 00:33:14.029
(Shocked)

826
00:33:15.128 --> 00:33:16.229
My goodness.

827
00:33:16.259 --> 00:33:18.898
My goodness, I caught it.

828
00:33:18.999 --> 00:33:20.127
(On the stage, he aims
for people's hearts.)

829
00:33:20.128 --> 00:33:22.239
(In the jungle, he aims for shrimp.)

830
00:33:22.838 --> 00:33:25.468
After catching a few shrimp,
I became confident.

831
00:33:25.469 --> 00:33:27.269
Later on, I even caught
shrimp with my hands.

832
00:33:27.608 --> 00:33:28.608
(The icon of the jungle)

833
00:33:28.608 --> 00:33:29.608
This is incredible.

834
00:33:30.178 --> 00:33:33.248
It was the kind of excitement
I have never felt before.

835
00:33:33.249 --> 00:33:34.809
Where else will I hunt?

836
00:33:35.009 --> 00:33:36.049
Do you want to go in?

837
00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:38.689
I am sorry. Don't run away.

838
00:33:39.949 --> 00:33:41.489
Your friends are here.

839
00:33:42.858 --> 00:33:44.218
(He satisfies his preys.)

840
00:33:44.219 --> 00:33:45.219
This is fun.

841
00:33:46.229 --> 00:33:47.229
There is one.

842
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:49.528
(Moon Sik has failed consecutive times.)

843
00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:52.528
(Focused)

844
00:33:52.529 --> 00:33:54.627
(Will he fail again?)

845
00:33:54.628 --> 00:33:55.968
(Nice catch)

846
00:33:55.969 --> 00:33:57.698
- I caught it.
- Did you catch it?

847
00:33:57.699 --> 00:33:58.708
Yes.

848
00:33:58.709 --> 00:33:59.709
(He finally caught it.)

849
00:34:02.138 --> 00:34:05.607
(In the end, )

850
00:34:05.608 --> 00:34:07.047
(he catches it after many tries.)

851
00:34:07.048 --> 00:34:09.249
What was that?

852
00:34:09.448 --> 00:34:11.019
Its foreleg fell off.

853
00:34:13.048 --> 00:34:15.088
It's very strong.

854
00:34:15.089 --> 00:34:16.419
Its foreleg fell off.

855
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:20.428
My goodness.

856
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:22.859
I saved my face.

857
00:34:25.528 --> 00:34:29.039
(A bit later)

858
00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:35.508
I caught shrimp's leg.

859
00:34:36.238 --> 00:34:39.749
(I have the leg you lost.)

860
00:34:42.178 --> 00:34:43.848
(He gives up.)

861
00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:46.795
It looks like I won't catch anything here.

862
00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:47.848
Did you catch something?

863
00:34:49.118 --> 00:34:51.059
I missed five shrimp.

864
00:34:52.089 --> 00:34:53.129
They were big too.

865
00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:56.229
- I caught one.
- I should have brought a tool.

866
00:34:57.129 --> 00:34:58.327
(He's upset.)

867
00:34:58.328 --> 00:35:01.069
I don't even feel upset because
I didn't catch anything.

868
00:35:02.999 --> 00:35:04.039
Did you catch it?

869
00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:07.109
I caught 4 or 5 of them.

870
00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:08.908
(It's this big.)

871
00:35:09.209 --> 00:35:11.538
- I caught 1.
- I caught 4.

872
00:35:11.539 --> 00:35:12.749
Good job.

873
00:35:13.149 --> 00:35:15.209
I wish they caught one crab.

874
00:35:15.249 --> 00:35:16.479
Did they catch crabs?

875
00:35:16.819 --> 00:35:18.248
I don't know how the other team is doing.

876
00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:20.117
- Let's go.
- I did my share.

877
00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:23.019
- I missed about five shrimp.
- They're so fast.

878
00:35:23.059 --> 00:35:24.658
They were big too.

879
00:35:25.158 --> 00:35:26.205
I missed about five shrimp.

880
00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:28.157
At that time, the Land Team goes...

881
00:35:28.158 --> 00:35:31.128
farther into the forest to look for food.

882
00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.698
Look at the ground.

883
00:35:34.629 --> 00:35:37.339
Won't coconut crabs be
near the coconut trees?

884
00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:39.569
You might find them...

885
00:35:39.638 --> 00:35:41.008
on the trunk of a tree.

886
00:35:41.169 --> 00:35:43.737
- It might fall from the above.
- Then we will faint.

887
00:35:43.738 --> 00:35:45.138
We will faint.

888
00:35:45.749 --> 00:35:47.748
Would you rather see a frog
fall or a coconut crab fall?

889
00:35:47.749 --> 00:35:48.948
- A coconut crab.
- Really?

890
00:35:49.948 --> 00:35:51.319
It's edible.

891
00:35:52.118 --> 00:35:54.887
Do coconut crabs...

892
00:35:54.888 --> 00:35:56.257
They only eat coconuts.

893
00:35:56.258 --> 00:35:57.289
Do they hold coconuts?

894
00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:59.987
They use their pincers to
dig out the coconut meat.

895
00:35:59.988 --> 00:36:01.628
- You will see the shells near it.
- It must be strong.

896
00:36:01.629 --> 00:36:05.058
There are a lot of shells
near the coconut crab.

897
00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:07.198
You will see the shells everywhere.

898
00:36:07.229 --> 00:36:08.738
You will see holes in the shells.

899
00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:10.097
These shells don't show that sign.

900
00:36:10.098 --> 00:36:11.297
(There are holes on the coconuts.)

901
00:36:11.298 --> 00:36:12.658
We must keep an eye out for those.

902
00:36:14.669 --> 00:36:16.908
We must go slow and look at them closely.

903
00:36:17.379 --> 00:36:20.078
(Let me explain about this
prince of the forest.)

904
00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:22.677
(Here it is!)

905
00:36:22.678 --> 00:36:23.678
(It's inside!)

906
00:36:23.678 --> 00:36:24.678
Here it is! Gosh!

907
00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:27.588
(From discovering coconut
crabs that are in hiding...)

908
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:30.319
(to catching the coconut crabs
with tremendous power...)

909
00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:32.358
That's right. In the special
in Solomon Islands,

910
00:36:32.359 --> 00:36:36.399
he had a long history with coconut crabs.

911
00:36:37.059 --> 00:36:40.229
Thanks to you, I got to
taste the coconut crabs.

912
00:36:40.868 --> 00:36:44.399
I will look forward to your amazing
skills as a veteran member.

913
00:36:45.439 --> 00:36:47.669
(He sets out with dignity.)

914
00:36:48.809 --> 00:36:52.048
The color is almost identical
to the color of the coconuts.

915
00:36:52.408 --> 00:36:53.677
They move in groups?

916
00:36:53.678 --> 00:36:54.708
(She tries her best as she's starving.)

917
00:36:54.709 --> 00:36:56.778
So when you spot one of them...

918
00:36:56.979 --> 00:36:58.649
(Her jaw is about to drop.)

919
00:36:58.988 --> 00:37:00.387
I don't think it's here.

920
00:37:00.388 --> 00:37:01.887
(Where on earth are the coconut crabs?)

921
00:37:01.888 --> 00:37:02.888
I hate bugs.

922
00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:06.058
- You startled me.
- What is it?

923
00:37:06.059 --> 00:37:07.887
- A bug went inside my mouth.
- Hey, what was that?

924
00:37:07.888 --> 00:37:09.058
(She was too focused with
her mouth wide open.)

925
00:37:09.059 --> 00:37:10.758
- I'm sorry.
- You startled me.

926
00:37:12.298 --> 00:37:13.628
(They look at the top of the trees.)

927
00:37:13.629 --> 00:37:15.349
There's nothing here. I can't see anything.

928
00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:18.398
There's nothing here. I
don't think they are here.

929
00:37:18.399 --> 00:37:19.507
(They look around the empty coconuts.)

930
00:37:19.508 --> 00:37:21.145
What if they're here, but
we can't just spot them?

931
00:37:21.169 --> 00:37:22.508
That's possible too.

932
00:37:23.479 --> 00:37:24.678
Gosh, there's none here.

933
00:37:25.548 --> 00:37:27.077
(I'm a bit sensitive
since I haven't eaten.)

934
00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.718
I wish I could eat a banana.

935
00:37:30.879 --> 00:37:33.819
What a bummer. I'm about
to faint out of hunger.

936
00:37:34.888 --> 00:37:36.488
(However, it's too early to give up.)

937
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:40.257
Under the tree... What is it?

938
00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:41.999
- Something's there.
- What's there?

939
00:37:42.399 --> 00:37:44.757
(Dam, the prince, is on the move.)

940
00:37:44.758 --> 00:37:45.827
(Could it be a coconut crab?)

941
00:37:45.828 --> 00:37:46.899
- What?
- Did you find it?

942
00:37:47.798 --> 00:37:50.367
Wait. That's not it. The
one on the right. Is it?

943
00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:51.539
- Where?
- It's big.

944
00:37:51.798 --> 00:37:52.839
What is this?

945
00:37:53.008 --> 00:37:55.137
- What is that?
- Isn't that a conch?

946
00:37:55.138 --> 00:37:57.539
- Baby coconut crabs are big.
- Hold on a minute.

947
00:37:57.678 --> 00:37:59.777
Oh, my. We might find some
crabs here if we are lucky.

948
00:37:59.778 --> 00:38:02.098
- Are there trails over there?
- Are there a lot of holes?

949
00:38:02.548 --> 00:38:04.379
It's not that. What is this?

950
00:38:04.778 --> 00:38:05.847
That's a hermit crab.

951
00:38:05.848 --> 00:38:07.648
- A hermit crab.
- We can't eat this, can we?

952
00:38:07.919 --> 00:38:09.258
This is sort of big.

953
00:38:09.859 --> 00:38:12.458
- I bet the crabs are here.
- Something like this.

954
00:38:12.459 --> 00:38:14.729
- What if they're in a pen?
- Look at that. Right?

955
00:38:14.758 --> 00:38:16.499
- There's a frog.
- Where? Hello.

956
00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:18.967
This one is inside the bucket.

957
00:38:18.968 --> 00:38:20.297
I have a feeling we might
find something here.

958
00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:22.938
- They must be somewhere like this.
- Really?

959
00:38:22.939 --> 00:38:24.859
I usually found them in a
place similar to this.

960
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:26.638
In a place like this?

961
00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:29.637
They hide between the trees.
We must look at them closely.

962
00:38:29.638 --> 00:38:31.438
(His pupils begin to dilate.)

963
00:38:31.439 --> 00:38:32.507
(And his radius begins to widen as well.)

964
00:38:32.508 --> 00:38:34.408
They might be at the top of the trees.

965
00:38:35.548 --> 00:38:37.447
- Like trees over there.
- What if they are somewhere there?

966
00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:40.047
- There must be holes.
- What kind of holes?

967
00:38:40.048 --> 00:38:41.768
- Like these?
- They make holes and dig up.

968
00:38:42.118 --> 00:38:45.018
- Here it is! Here it is!
- Gosh, you scared me.

969
00:38:45.019 --> 00:38:46.089
- Here it is.
- Where?

970
00:38:46.928 --> 00:38:49.527
(The prince wakes up the
entire, quiet forest.)

971
00:38:49.528 --> 00:38:50.927
- Here it is.
- Where?

972
00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:52.297
It's right there.

973
00:38:52.298 --> 00:38:53.867
(Where on earth is it?)

974
00:38:53.868 --> 00:38:55.668
- Where?
- It's right there. This is it!

975
00:38:55.669 --> 00:38:57.168
- That's huge.
- This is the crab.

976
00:38:57.169 --> 00:38:58.737
- Oh, my.
- Even I was surprised.

977
00:38:58.738 --> 00:39:00.468
- How are you going to catch it?
- Hold on.

978
00:39:00.769 --> 00:39:02.208
- Hold on. Stay here.
- It's over there.

979
00:39:02.209 --> 00:39:04.839
- It's humongous.
- They hide. We must look carefully.

980
00:39:05.178 --> 00:39:07.085
- We can push the tree away.
- Hang on a second.

981
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:08.677
- Hold on. That's...
- This is amazing.

982
00:39:08.678 --> 00:39:10.018
(He lifts the wooden post
which was concealing it.)

983
00:39:10.019 --> 00:39:12.219
- It's big. It looks like a monster.
- This one is big.

984
00:39:12.649 --> 00:39:13.649
Look at this.

985
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.418
- Yes! Food!
- It looks like an alien.

986
00:39:16.419 --> 00:39:17.859
It does look like an alien.

987
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.888
- Hey, get me the sticks.
- How did you spot that?

988
00:39:21.629 --> 00:39:22.698
We have to look closely.

989
00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:25.367
I must catch it with my hands.
I shouldn't use my power.

990
00:39:25.368 --> 00:39:26.867
They won't bite.

991
00:39:26.868 --> 00:39:28.327
- Be careful.
- I couldn't see anything.

992
00:39:28.328 --> 00:39:29.399
I have the saw.

993
00:39:30.039 --> 00:39:31.439
It really was hiding there.

994
00:39:31.939 --> 00:39:33.867
(As soon as Dam touches it,
it's ready to attack.)

995
00:39:33.868 --> 00:39:35.039
Its claw kicked at him.

996
00:39:36.078 --> 00:39:37.339
(They freeze.)

997
00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:39.777
Pick it up.

998
00:39:39.778 --> 00:39:41.378
(The power struggle is intense.)

999
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:43.277
But it looks exactly like that tree.

1000
00:39:43.278 --> 00:39:45.638
- Look. It's breaking everything.
- Did you hear the sound?

1001
00:39:45.689 --> 00:39:47.288
- It broke the wooden stick.
- Kang Nam, get me a strong one.

1002
00:39:47.289 --> 00:39:48.318
- Be careful.
- This one?

1003
00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:49.458
- Hey, you must be careful.
- I can just grab it.

1004
00:39:49.459 --> 00:39:50.959
No, no. You mustn't.

1005
00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:53.188
(Dam stops him from touching
it for safety reasons.)

1006
00:39:53.189 --> 00:39:54.887
- It'll cut your fingers. Watch out.
- I can grab its claws.

1007
00:39:54.888 --> 00:39:57.458
- You can, but you can't endure it.
- The claws?

1008
00:39:57.459 --> 00:39:58.739
It will try to spread its claws.

1009
00:39:58.968 --> 00:40:01.698
- Is it that powerful?
- We can't just grab the claws.

1010
00:40:03.939 --> 00:40:07.808
(Cho Rong picks up the
bamboo stick silently.)

1011
00:40:07.809 --> 00:40:10.677
(She's trying to squeeze in the
bamboo tree between claws.)

1012
00:40:10.678 --> 00:40:12.709
- Gosh, it's powerful. It's crazy.
- All right.

1013
00:40:13.209 --> 00:40:15.177
- It's really strong.
- There you go. Just grab it.

1014
00:40:15.178 --> 00:40:16.248
- We got it.
- Grab it.

1015
00:40:16.249 --> 00:40:19.047
- I can't lift this.
- Grab the stick.

1016
00:40:19.048 --> 00:40:21.225
(She contributes to a major
achievement by lifting it.)

1017
00:40:21.249 --> 00:40:23.009
(The strong claws don't
let go of the tree.)

1018
00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.835
- We did it. We did it!
- Gosh, it really is strong.

1019
00:40:25.859 --> 00:40:27.258
(Hanging in the air)

1020
00:40:27.988 --> 00:40:29.458
We must use strong tools
when we spread the claws.

1021
00:40:29.459 --> 00:40:32.427
(Cho Ring is demonstrating amazing
strength at a critical moment.)

1022
00:40:32.428 --> 00:40:34.467
(They did manage to lift it up.)

1023
00:40:34.468 --> 00:40:35.597
How can I put this in?

1024
00:40:35.598 --> 00:40:37.967
Hey, this looks really nasty.

1025
00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:39.538
- Open up the bag.
- Wait.

1026
00:40:39.539 --> 00:40:41.138
(I won't let go once I grab it.)

1027
00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:42.777
Hold on a minute. Open the bag.

1028
00:40:42.778 --> 00:40:44.077
- Open it?
- Yes.

1029
00:40:44.078 --> 00:40:45.138
Open it up.

1030
00:40:45.508 --> 00:40:46.978
- Let go.
- Even if I try...

1031
00:40:46.979 --> 00:40:48.819
Hey, let's just put the sticks too.

1032
00:40:49.419 --> 00:40:50.847
Just put everything into the bag.

1033
00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:52.648
- Let's hurry back.
- Just put everything in.

1034
00:40:53.189 --> 00:40:54.218
Put it in.

1035
00:40:54.689 --> 00:40:56.788
I would have never thought
it'd be this strong.

1036
00:40:56.789 --> 00:40:58.689
- It's big.
- Is it bigger than average?

1037
00:40:59.258 --> 00:41:02.257
I've seen one as big as this one,

1038
00:41:02.258 --> 00:41:03.435
but this one is still considered big.

1039
00:41:03.459 --> 00:41:04.798
It got so heavy.

1040
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:08.938
If Dam weren't there, we
wouldn't have found it.

1041
00:41:08.939 --> 00:41:10.338
He was really thorough.

1042
00:41:10.339 --> 00:41:13.237
He was more thorough than us.

1043
00:41:13.238 --> 00:41:15.068
When I saw him searching
the forest inside out,

1044
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:16.709
I thought he was really phenomenal.

1045
00:41:17.678 --> 00:41:18.708
(Even his voice is amazingly loud.)

1046
00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:20.749
I thought we got lucky.

1047
00:41:21.709 --> 00:41:25.149
Luckily, we found a big
one, not a small one.

1048
00:41:25.948 --> 00:41:27.847
Whenever I starred on this show,

1049
00:41:27.848 --> 00:41:30.487
I wasn't good at hunting,

1050
00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:33.028
but I was good at looking
and finding things.

1051
00:41:33.629 --> 00:41:35.258
Dam, you're incredible.

1052
00:41:35.899 --> 00:41:37.058
This is the coconut crab.

1053
00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:38.059
(Kang Nam is surprised.)

1054
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.568
I don't know when the other
team is going to come back.

1055
00:41:39.569 --> 00:41:41.168
(Anyway)

1056
00:41:41.169 --> 00:41:43.038
I think they might not come
back until they catch one.

1057
00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:44.568
(I want to tell this good news to them.)

1058
00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:46.368
Should we go and cook this?

1059
00:42:05.118 --> 00:42:07.888
- Good work, everyone.
- Great job.

1060
00:42:08.118 --> 00:42:09.688
- What about the crab?
- Great job.

1061
00:42:09.689 --> 00:42:10.757
- Did you catch some?
- What about the crab?

1062
00:42:10.758 --> 00:42:13.229
Well, we looked everywhere.

1063
00:42:13.658 --> 00:42:15.197
- You didn't find one?
- I had a feeling it'd be the case.

1064
00:42:15.198 --> 00:42:16.198
What is that?

1065
00:42:16.658 --> 00:42:17.858
It's heavy. Try lifting it.

1066
00:42:17.859 --> 00:42:18.927
(Do you want to look at
the shrimps I caught?)

1067
00:42:18.928 --> 00:42:20.729
- What are these?
- Be careful.

1068
00:42:21.028 --> 00:42:22.039
Be careful. They pop up.

1069
00:42:23.169 --> 00:42:24.237
What are those?

1070
00:42:24.238 --> 00:42:25.708
- They are shrimps.
- Shrimps!

1071
00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:27.068
- They're big.
- Hey, they're huge.

1072
00:42:27.069 --> 00:42:29.178
- It was hard for us to catch them.
- They are big.

1073
00:42:30.008 --> 00:42:32.178
- 1, 2 shrimps.
- That's nice.

1074
00:42:34.008 --> 00:42:35.047
These are shrimps.

1075
00:42:35.048 --> 00:42:36.077
(They keep bragging about shrimps.)

1076
00:42:36.078 --> 00:42:38.447
- They are so many. It looks tasty.
- You got them from the sea?

1077
00:42:38.448 --> 00:42:39.818
- There's another one.
- This is perfect for you.

1078
00:42:39.819 --> 00:42:41.117
- Shrimp.
- You still have more?

1079
00:42:41.118 --> 00:42:42.359
It's really hard to catch them.

1080
00:42:43.019 --> 00:42:44.657
- The big one.
- They are not coming out.

1081
00:42:44.658 --> 00:42:45.757
- There's another one.
- Another one?

1082
00:42:45.758 --> 00:42:47.858
Did you catch something?
Why aren't you excited?

1083
00:42:47.859 --> 00:42:50.197
- You must be surprised.
- We are.

1084
00:42:50.198 --> 00:42:52.427
My gut tells me Dam caught something.

1085
00:42:52.428 --> 00:42:54.938
His posture seems different from before.
Don't you agree?

1086
00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.637
- This is it.
- Great work.

1087
00:42:56.638 --> 00:42:57.668
I'll be back.

1088
00:42:57.669 --> 00:42:59.208
- What is it?
- Dam is acting strange.

1089
00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:01.614
- What is it? What did you bring?
- He must've caught something.

1090
00:43:01.638 --> 00:43:03.709
- What did he catch?
- That's a coconut crab!

1091
00:43:04.178 --> 00:43:05.338
- You caught it.
- Seriously?

1092
00:43:06.149 --> 00:43:07.547
- Goodness.
- Isn't that humongous?

1093
00:43:07.548 --> 00:43:08.548
Is that a coconut crab?

1094
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:09.577
(The main ingredient appears.)

1095
00:43:09.578 --> 00:43:10.738
- It cut the stick.
- No way!

1096
00:43:11.118 --> 00:43:12.847
- Is this the coconut crab?
- That's massive.

1097
00:43:12.848 --> 00:43:13.918
(How incredible!)

1098
00:43:13.919 --> 00:43:16.358
- Dam found it under the tree.
- Really?

1099
00:43:16.359 --> 00:43:17.387
- Yes.
- That's awesome.

1100
00:43:17.388 --> 00:43:19.458
I can only imagine how delicious
those claws will taste.

1101
00:43:19.459 --> 00:43:20.527
(The claws seem quite overwhelming.)

1102
00:43:20.528 --> 00:43:22.288
If you see this at night,
it might scare me.

1103
00:43:22.959 --> 00:43:25.367
When I saw it up close, it
scared me out of my wits.

1104
00:43:25.368 --> 00:43:26.498
This looks like a spider too.

1105
00:43:26.499 --> 00:43:27.527
(This is the coconut crab!)

1106
00:43:27.528 --> 00:43:29.368
- People might think it's a spider.
- Exactly.

1107
00:43:29.738 --> 00:43:31.669
I really wanted to see this.

1108
00:43:32.738 --> 00:43:34.637
- It was hiding really well.
- We have a lot to eat.

1109
00:43:34.638 --> 00:43:35.878
- How did it hide?
- It was...

1110
00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:37.938
- It looked like a tree.
- We couldn't see anything.

1111
00:43:37.939 --> 00:43:39.108
- It didn't move?
- No, it didn't.

1112
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:40.208
- Dam, you found it?
- Yes.

1113
00:43:40.209 --> 00:43:41.778
- Dam spotted it.
- You scored one.

1114
00:43:42.379 --> 00:43:44.887
Imagine how strong the claws are.
The crab cut the stick.

1115
00:43:44.888 --> 00:43:47.048
- Do you understand me?
- I really wanted to see this.

1116
00:43:47.289 --> 00:43:48.358
Try lifting it.

1117
00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.418
- I get to see it at last.
- That's it.

1118
00:43:49.419 --> 00:43:50.958
- It worked.
- Look at that.

1119
00:43:50.959 --> 00:43:53.004
- Look at its strength.
- It's only using just a claw.

1120
00:43:53.028 --> 00:43:55.728
It's lifting its entire
body with just a claw.

1121
00:43:55.729 --> 00:43:56.998
- Dose it have innards?
- It has innards and everything.

1122
00:43:56.999 --> 00:43:59.367
- That must be so tasty.
- The innards.

1123
00:43:59.368 --> 00:44:01.728
- Gosh, it's so strong.
- Let's dip shrimps in the innards.

1124
00:44:01.899 --> 00:44:04.019
- I can't touch it.
- Dam, you've cooked this before.

1125
00:44:04.269 --> 00:44:05.967
Boiling this is the best way to go at this.

1126
00:44:05.968 --> 00:44:08.908
Shouldn't we wash this once?
Wash it in the sea.

1127
00:44:09.138 --> 00:44:11.677
Since we have to crack the
shell to eat the crab meat,

1128
00:44:11.678 --> 00:44:13.478
- we can just cook it.
- We can just get rid of the sands.

1129
00:44:13.479 --> 00:44:15.519
- Can we just cook it?
- Gosh, that sounds so good.

1130
00:44:16.078 --> 00:44:17.398
- Let's hurry and cook.
- This...

1131
00:44:17.519 --> 00:44:20.819
- It is huge indeed.
- It is massive.

1132
00:44:21.689 --> 00:44:24.418
- All right. First, put it there.
- Let's boil the water first.

1133
00:44:24.419 --> 00:44:25.458
Put it there.

1134
00:44:25.459 --> 00:44:26.459
(Boil the water to cook the crab.)

1135
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.058
(To make shrimp soup, dunk only
the shrimps into the canteen.)

1136
00:44:28.059 --> 00:44:29.728
I bet this is going to taste great.

1137
00:44:29.729 --> 00:44:31.205
(To make shrimp soup, dunk only
the shrimps into the canteen.)

1138
00:44:31.229 --> 00:44:34.399
(They make the fire bigger
to cook it faster.)

1139
00:44:36.339 --> 00:44:38.268
That's right. We picked
chili peppers earlier.

1140
00:44:38.269 --> 00:44:40.068
- Should we put them in?
- We should...

1141
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:41.137
(For the soup, he chops the chili peppers.)

1142
00:44:41.138 --> 00:44:42.538
We should put the chili peppers in.

1143
00:44:45.278 --> 00:44:47.158
- It's spicy.
- Gosh, this smells really spicy.

1144
00:44:47.278 --> 00:44:48.319
It's spicy.

1145
00:44:49.078 --> 00:44:50.078
Put everything in.

1146
00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:51.318
(They put in everything
to make the soup spicy.)

1147
00:44:51.319 --> 00:44:52.919
It's going to be tasty since it's spicy.

1148
00:44:53.749 --> 00:44:56.218
- This is enough.
- Let's see how tasty it is.

1149
00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:59.299
- Have you eaten it before?
- This is my first time eating it.

1150
00:45:00.189 --> 00:45:01.927
I've never eaten it in the jungle.

1151
00:45:01.928 --> 00:45:03.558
(Welcome. Is this your first
time tasting a coconut crab?)

1152
00:45:03.559 --> 00:45:04.628
Hey, get the canteen ready.

1153
00:45:04.629 --> 00:45:05.668
(It's time to cook the coconut crab.)

1154
00:45:05.669 --> 00:45:06.899
- Look.
- Put it in.

1155
00:45:07.798 --> 00:45:09.899
- Gather your claws.
- Oh, no.

1156
00:45:09.939 --> 00:45:11.274
(They try to put the
coconut crab in water.)

1157
00:45:11.298 --> 00:45:12.907
- Be careful.
- Watch its pincers.

1158
00:45:12.908 --> 00:45:13.938
(It resists going into the water.)

1159
00:45:13.939 --> 00:45:15.408
(Flustered)

1160
00:45:16.408 --> 00:45:17.408
(It uses its strength to hold out.)

1161
00:45:17.409 --> 00:45:18.508
Hold on.

1162
00:45:20.979 --> 00:45:23.518
(He almost overturns the pot.)

1163
00:45:23.519 --> 00:45:25.148
My goodness, it's strong.

1164
00:45:25.149 --> 00:45:27.217
- Let's turn it over.
- Let's do that.

1165
00:45:27.218 --> 00:45:28.289
Turn it over.

1166
00:45:30.289 --> 00:45:32.058
- That's good enough.
- Its legs are too long.

1167
00:45:32.059 --> 00:45:33.128
- Hold on.
- It's okay.

1168
00:45:33.129 --> 00:45:34.589
It's okay. It went in.

1169
00:45:34.859 --> 00:45:36.499
It won't let go of the bamboo.

1170
00:45:36.959 --> 00:45:38.697
There we go. We got it inside.

1171
00:45:38.698 --> 00:45:39.827
(It finally goes inside the pot.)

1172
00:45:39.828 --> 00:45:42.367
- Is the pot too small?
- Put a rock on it.

1173
00:45:42.368 --> 00:45:43.438
(Putting a big rock on the
lid solves the problem.)

1174
00:45:43.439 --> 00:45:44.499
The pot is too small.

1175
00:45:44.669 --> 00:45:47.339
This is incredible. I will
get to taste coconut crab.

1176
00:45:47.908 --> 00:45:50.077
(They now need to wait for it to cook.)

1177
00:45:50.078 --> 00:45:52.547
(It's the hardest to wait for food.)

1178
00:45:52.548 --> 00:45:55.347
(They become hungrier.)

1179
00:45:55.348 --> 00:45:57.347
(They become tired.)

1180
00:45:57.348 --> 00:45:58.789
(Bo Mi is about to doze off.)

1181
00:46:00.019 --> 00:46:01.789
It's so quiet.

1182
00:46:02.819 --> 00:46:04.588
Shall we eat shrimp soup?

1183
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:06.328
- I love the idea.
- I think it's boiling.

1184
00:46:07.028 --> 00:46:09.798
Ta-da! Ta-da!

1185
00:46:10.158 --> 00:46:11.358
(Shrimp soup is revealed.)

1186
00:46:11.359 --> 00:46:13.499
- It's nice.
- Look at the color.

1187
00:46:14.868 --> 00:46:16.238
We can eat them now.

1188
00:46:17.499 --> 00:46:18.808
Tom yum goong.

1189
00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:19.809
(The soup contains habanero peppers...)

1190
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.209
I bet the soup tastes wonderful.

1191
00:46:21.238 --> 00:46:23.478
(and plump shrimp.)

1192
00:46:23.479 --> 00:46:25.479
Soup is the best.

1193
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:30.117
(Tae Gon tastes the soup first.)

1194
00:46:30.118 --> 00:46:31.789
(How does it taste?)

1195
00:46:32.988 --> 00:46:34.048
Gosh, it's hot.

1196
00:46:36.959 --> 00:46:38.859
Habanero peppers were hot.

1197
00:46:39.328 --> 00:46:41.797
(He added all of the spicy peppers.)

1198
00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:44.257
- You added too much.
- I thought so.

1199
00:46:44.258 --> 00:46:45.645
- You added too much.
- How many did you add?

1200
00:46:45.669 --> 00:46:46.697
(Coughing)

1201
00:46:46.698 --> 00:46:48.098
He added a lot of peppers.

1202
00:46:48.198 --> 00:46:50.068
- This is a disaster.
- It's not that spicy.

1203
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:53.208
- It's a bit spicy.
- That's right.

1204
00:46:53.209 --> 00:46:55.737
- It's too spicy.
- It's like spicy ramyeon...

1205
00:46:55.738 --> 00:46:57.277
with too much noodles.

1206
00:46:57.278 --> 00:47:00.177
- It's too spicy.
- You shouldn't had added a lot.

1207
00:47:00.178 --> 00:47:01.547
It needs a little bit of salt.

1208
00:47:01.548 --> 00:47:03.847
- It needs a little bit of salt.
- It's too spicy.

1209
00:47:03.848 --> 00:47:05.464
- I knew this would happen.
- It tastes good at the end.

1210
00:47:05.488 --> 00:47:07.948
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

1211
00:47:09.859 --> 00:47:12.487
Even though it's too
spicy, I want to eat more.

1212
00:47:12.488 --> 00:47:14.328
- It's tasty.
- It's for the youngest member.

1213
00:47:14.828 --> 00:47:17.097
- Thank you.
- You want soup when you are hungry.

1214
00:47:17.098 --> 00:47:18.628
- Here is one...
- It's spicy.

1215
00:47:18.629 --> 00:47:19.728
For another young member.

1216
00:47:19.729 --> 00:47:21.068
It's the one I caught.

1217
00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:23.798
Look at this. It's so picturesque.

1218
00:47:23.999 --> 00:47:25.108
- This is crazy.
- It's pretty.

1219
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:27.208
- It looks pretty from the front.
- It's in the perfect state.

1220
00:47:27.209 --> 00:47:29.737
This is the one I caught.
It's missing its pincer.

1221
00:47:29.738 --> 00:47:30.808
Moon Sik.

1222
00:47:30.809 --> 00:47:32.749
- You get a big one.
- Thank you.

1223
00:47:33.209 --> 00:47:34.407
Go ahead and eat.

1224
00:47:34.408 --> 00:47:35.725
(They hurriedly remove the shell.)

1225
00:47:35.749 --> 00:47:37.618
- Tell me how it tastes.
- You should eat too.

1226
00:47:38.019 --> 00:47:40.089
- Shall we clink them?
- Shall we?

1227
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:41.859
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1228
00:47:44.789 --> 00:47:47.388
(She carefully puts it in her mouth.)

1229
00:47:47.559 --> 00:47:50.128
(She gives a prayer of thanks.)

1230
00:47:50.129 --> 00:47:52.327
- My goodness.
- How does it taste?

1231
00:47:52.328 --> 00:47:53.797
It doesn't taste anything
like shrimp I am used to.

1232
00:47:53.798 --> 00:47:55.898
- How does it taste?
- It's incredibly delicious.

1233
00:47:55.899 --> 00:47:57.468
- Is it delicious?
- It's nutty.

1234
00:47:58.109 --> 00:48:00.069
We should catch more shrimp tomorrow.

1235
00:48:02.008 --> 00:48:03.178
It's nutty.

1236
00:48:03.678 --> 00:48:05.677
I am glad there is more
than one for each person.

1237
00:48:05.678 --> 00:48:06.847
It's so tasty!

1238
00:48:06.848 --> 00:48:08.277
- Really?
- Habanero pepper was a good choice.

1239
00:48:08.278 --> 00:48:10.778
- Really?
- It's seasoned just right.

1240
00:48:11.689 --> 00:48:12.887
- It's tasty.
- Seriously.

1241
00:48:12.888 --> 00:48:15.758
- It tastes like an expensive dish.
- Bite into it slowly.

1242
00:48:16.819 --> 00:48:18.788
- We finished it.
- It's tasty.

1243
00:48:18.789 --> 00:48:20.129
Eat the shell too.

1244
00:48:20.258 --> 00:48:22.328
It's really tasty.

1245
00:48:22.928 --> 00:48:24.158
It's really tasty.

1246
00:48:25.028 --> 00:48:26.768
- It's really tasty.
- It is, right?

1247
00:48:26.769 --> 00:48:28.569
- It's really tasty.
- We need to catch more.

1248
00:48:28.868 --> 00:48:31.407
When you watch the show, you
think, "It can't be that tasty."

1249
00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:33.339
- It tastes the best.
- Seriously.

1250
00:48:34.809 --> 00:48:37.809
It doesn't contain any flavor enhancer.

1251
00:48:38.379 --> 00:48:40.208
It warmed up my stomach.

1252
00:48:40.209 --> 00:48:41.918
(It's the perfect time
to eat coconut crab.)

1253
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.048
My stomach is warm.

1254
00:48:43.348 --> 00:48:45.348
How tasty will coconut crab be?

1255
00:48:45.419 --> 00:48:46.518
- This one?
- Seriously.

1256
00:48:46.519 --> 00:48:47.879
Coconut crab will be tasty, right?

1257
00:48:48.089 --> 00:48:51.728
Since they stimulated their
appetite with spicy shrimp soup,

1258
00:48:51.729 --> 00:48:55.328
it's time to try the
main dish, coconut crab.

1259
00:48:56.598 --> 00:48:58.128
- My goodness.
- Open it.

1260
00:48:58.129 --> 00:48:59.197
(The hero of the day, Ryu
Dam will open the lid.)

1261
00:48:59.198 --> 00:49:00.728
In 1, 2, 3.

1262
00:49:00.729 --> 00:49:01.898
(Here it comes.)

1263
00:49:01.899 --> 00:49:03.838
(The coconut crab shows itself.)

1264
00:49:03.839 --> 00:49:04.868
It looks nice.

1265
00:49:05.138 --> 00:49:07.007
- It's red.
- This is incredible.

1266
00:49:07.008 --> 00:49:08.038
(It's red.)

1267
00:49:08.039 --> 00:49:09.478
- It's cooked nicely.
- Seriously.

1268
00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:10.479
(The main dish shows off
its vibrant color.)

1269
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.578
What should we do?

1270
00:49:12.249 --> 00:49:14.048
It already looks tasty.

1271
00:49:14.348 --> 00:49:16.318
- This is incredible.
- It looks tasty.

1272
00:49:16.319 --> 00:49:17.625
(Welcome to the world of coconut crab.)

1273
00:49:17.649 --> 00:49:18.749
It looks tasty.

1274
00:49:22.988 --> 00:49:24.059
What should we do?

1275
00:49:25.328 --> 00:49:26.328
(She wears her cap
backwards in preparation.)

1276
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:27.888
I need to eat coconut crab like this.

1277
00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.657
Hold on. Let go of it.

1278
00:49:30.658 --> 00:49:31.668
(He picks up the coconut crab.)

1279
00:49:31.669 --> 00:49:33.598
- It's so big.
- Look at that color.

1280
00:49:34.399 --> 00:49:35.439
Be careful.

1281
00:49:35.638 --> 00:49:36.939
Let's eat the shell too.

1282
00:49:37.868 --> 00:49:39.788
- Let's eat the shell too.
- It looks delicious.

1283
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:41.169
The shell?

1284
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:44.039
It's the biggest coconut crab I have seen.

1285
00:49:45.548 --> 00:49:47.577
How shall we pull it apart?

1286
00:49:47.578 --> 00:49:49.378
(They can't take their
eyes off of the crab.)

1287
00:49:49.548 --> 00:49:52.348
(Dam takes off the pincers
for distribution.)

1288
00:49:52.819 --> 00:49:54.047
- Is that the tastiest part?
- Look at this.

1289
00:49:54.048 --> 00:49:55.117
(The pincer is bigger than Dam's hand.)

1290
00:49:55.118 --> 00:49:57.618
The meat from this part...

1291
00:49:57.758 --> 00:49:59.088
- is the best.
- Does it taste the best?

1292
00:49:59.089 --> 00:50:01.558
The pincers are the best.

1293
00:50:01.559 --> 00:50:02.798
- Really?
- The pincers.

1294
00:50:03.428 --> 00:50:05.498
I can smell it from here.

1295
00:50:05.499 --> 00:50:07.097
- It's so big.
- Is it the tastiest part?

1296
00:50:07.098 --> 00:50:09.169
- Whom should I give it to?
- Give it to the chief.

1297
00:50:09.598 --> 00:50:11.137
Whom should I give it to?

1298
00:50:11.138 --> 00:50:12.867
Does anyone want to work for it?

1299
00:50:12.868 --> 00:50:13.948
(Who will get the pincers?)

1300
00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:18.077
(Bo Mi begins to dance.)

1301
00:50:18.078 --> 00:50:21.677
(I want a pincer.)

1302
00:50:21.678 --> 00:50:24.819
- Give it to her.
- Bo Mi.

1303
00:50:25.089 --> 00:50:26.617
- Thank you.
- Bo Mi gets one.

1304
00:50:26.618 --> 00:50:27.648
(She worked for the pincer.)

1305
00:50:27.649 --> 00:50:29.718
Give us a performance of "NoNoNo".

1306
00:50:30.859 --> 00:50:32.229
It looks delicious.

1307
00:50:32.959 --> 00:50:35.728
The juice fell on my hand.

1308
00:50:35.729 --> 00:50:38.499
Here it comes! It came out!

1309
00:50:39.129 --> 00:50:41.228
(The crab meat from the
pincer shows itself.)

1310
00:50:41.229 --> 00:50:42.368
I want it.

1311
00:50:42.798 --> 00:50:44.467
- I want it.
- It smells good.

1312
00:50:44.468 --> 00:50:45.714
(It's just as I have seen on TV.)

1313
00:50:45.738 --> 00:50:48.278
- Chief.
- I want it.

1314
00:50:48.638 --> 00:50:50.479
- Chief.
- Thank you.

1315
00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:53.309
(Grateful and touched)

1316
00:50:55.048 --> 00:50:56.177
(She takes the first bite.)

1317
00:50:56.178 --> 00:50:57.698
- It looks incredible.
- Look at this.

1318
00:50:58.149 --> 00:50:59.988
(How does it taste?)

1319
00:51:00.388 --> 00:51:02.388
(Melting)

1320
00:51:06.488 --> 00:51:07.559
I am tearing up.

1321
00:51:08.729 --> 00:51:09.758
It's the best.

1322
00:51:10.129 --> 00:51:12.968
(Cho Rong tries it next.)

1323
00:51:13.229 --> 00:51:17.039
(She takes a big bite.)

1324
00:51:17.368 --> 00:51:19.109
(Smiling)

1325
00:51:19.269 --> 00:51:20.737
(There is no need for words.)

1326
00:51:20.738 --> 00:51:21.907
It must taste delicious.

1327
00:51:21.908 --> 00:51:24.637
Take one each. Pass it down.

1328
00:51:24.638 --> 00:51:26.348
- It's really tasty, right?
- It's hot.

1329
00:51:26.508 --> 00:51:28.778
You shouldn't eat all of it.

1330
00:51:29.848 --> 00:51:31.987
- Eat half of it.
- Why?

1331
00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:33.887
There are crab innards. They act as sauce.

1332
00:51:33.888 --> 00:51:36.218
- It's sweet and tasty.
- It's very tasty.

1333
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:37.819
It's hot.

1334
00:51:38.729 --> 00:51:41.827
(This is Tae Gon's first
time to eat coconut crab.)

1335
00:51:41.828 --> 00:51:43.327
(It's a big piece.)

1336
00:51:43.328 --> 00:51:45.169
Take this.

1337
00:51:45.629 --> 00:51:46.698
Here.

1338
00:51:46.968 --> 00:51:49.939
(The taste is real.)

1339
00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:54.507
(Jin Woon can't help but become impressed.)

1340
00:51:54.508 --> 00:51:55.609
It's so tasty.

1341
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:57.439
It's so tasty.

1342
00:51:57.508 --> 00:51:59.577
- It's the best.
- It's so tasty.

1343
00:51:59.578 --> 00:52:00.578
(She is absorbed in the
taste of coconut crab.)

1344
00:52:00.579 --> 00:52:01.918
It's unbelievable.

1345
00:52:01.919 --> 00:52:04.379
(The switch for eating mode turns on.)

1346
00:52:04.819 --> 00:52:06.088
(This is paradise.)

1347
00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:07.819
- Is it good?
- It's so tasty.

1348
00:52:10.118 --> 00:52:11.927
(Chewy)

1349
00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:14.657
(Look at this.)

1350
00:52:14.658 --> 00:52:16.859
(It's a crab meat bomb.)

1351
00:52:17.729 --> 00:52:19.867
(The crab meat disappears
into Bo Mi's mouth.)

1352
00:52:19.868 --> 00:52:22.697
There is a lot of crab meat.

1353
00:52:22.698 --> 00:52:24.168
Bo Mi looks like she is at Garak Market.

1354
00:52:24.169 --> 00:52:25.609
(She doesn't leave anything behind.)

1355
00:52:25.908 --> 00:52:27.007
This is incredible.

1356
00:52:27.008 --> 00:52:28.738
(While Bo Mi is having her fill, )

1357
00:52:29.539 --> 00:52:31.277
I can't eat it.

1358
00:52:31.278 --> 00:52:33.649
(Cho Rong is having trouble
cracking the shell.)

1359
00:52:33.678 --> 00:52:35.398
I want to eat it. This is driving me crazy.

1360
00:52:37.948 --> 00:52:39.019
No, no.

1361
00:52:39.649 --> 00:52:41.249
(Why can't I crack the shell?)

1362
00:52:41.819 --> 00:52:43.959
(I want to eat it.)

1363
00:52:44.258 --> 00:52:48.028
(Look at this, Cho Rong.)

1364
00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:52.068
(Cho Rong's determination
and Bo Mi's eating show)

1365
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:54.499
(Their situations are vastly different.)

1366
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:58.438
(After much effort, )

1367
00:52:58.439 --> 00:53:00.438
(she manages to get a piece of crab meat.)

1368
00:53:00.439 --> 00:53:04.109
(She puts it in her mouth right away.)

1369
00:53:07.078 --> 00:53:09.547
(Sighing)

1370
00:53:09.548 --> 00:53:10.548
This is...

1371
00:53:11.048 --> 00:53:14.689
The crabs I have had so
far weren't real crabs.

1372
00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:17.189
It's so tasty.

1373
00:53:17.888 --> 00:53:19.487
How can it be so plump?

1374
00:53:19.488 --> 00:53:21.205
(Before I met you, I thought
all crabs were small.)

1375
00:53:21.229 --> 00:53:23.158
All of these are innards.

1376
00:53:23.399 --> 00:53:24.728
- I see.
- Really?

1377
00:53:24.729 --> 00:53:26.068
(Here comes the sauce.)

1378
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:28.138
- It's really tasty.
- It's really tasty.

1379
00:53:31.198 --> 00:53:33.808
(Pouring out)

1380
00:53:33.809 --> 00:53:36.838
(It's a waterfall of crab innards.)

1381
00:53:36.839 --> 00:53:38.209
Do we dip crab meat in it?

1382
00:53:38.879 --> 00:53:40.907
(The 2nd round of eating...)

1383
00:53:40.908 --> 00:53:43.019
(is coming soon.)

1384
00:53:46.118 --> 00:53:48.689
(I must eat that.)

1385
00:53:49.819 --> 00:53:52.129
(She can't help but lick her lips.)

1386
00:53:52.959 --> 00:53:55.027
(They can't take their eyes off...)

1387
00:53:55.028 --> 00:53:56.928
(of the curry-colored crab innards.)

1388
00:53:58.298 --> 00:53:59.804
(Her switch for eating mode turns back on.)

1389
00:53:59.828 --> 00:54:00.867
(The crab innards sauce is ready.)

1390
00:54:00.868 --> 00:54:02.467
Dip crab meat in it.

1391
00:54:02.468 --> 00:54:04.838
- I was curious about it.
- My goodness.

1392
00:54:04.839 --> 00:54:05.908
I was curious about it.

1393
00:54:06.008 --> 00:54:07.038
(They dip crab meat in
the crab innards sauce.)

1394
00:54:07.039 --> 00:54:08.578
Eat crab innards with it.

1395
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:13.948
(I have been waiting for this moment.)

1396
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:18.447
(How does coconut crab meat
with crab innards sauce taste?)

1397
00:54:18.448 --> 00:54:21.959
(He has no words.)

1398
00:54:23.019 --> 00:54:25.888
(How will Kang Nam react?)

1399
00:54:26.859 --> 00:54:27.859
It's tasty.

1400
00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:30.698
It's really tasty.

1401
00:54:31.229 --> 00:54:33.399
It doesn't taste fishy at all.

1402
00:54:34.169 --> 00:54:35.399
It tastes like pasta sauce.

1403
00:54:35.499 --> 00:54:37.344
- It does, right?
- It tastes like pasta sauce.

1404
00:54:37.368 --> 00:54:39.709
(The taste brings a smile
to Moon Sik's face.)

1405
00:54:40.539 --> 00:54:43.407
- Look at this.
- This is fat from coconut.

1406
00:54:43.408 --> 00:54:45.488
(Cho Rong takes a big bite
of crab meat with sauce.)

1407
00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:47.277
(Sighing)

1408
00:54:47.278 --> 00:54:48.278
(Nodding)

1409
00:54:48.279 --> 00:54:50.618
- It tastes different.
- It does, right?

1410
00:54:50.819 --> 00:54:52.447
- This is crazy.
- It tastes like pasta sauce.

1411
00:54:52.448 --> 00:54:53.448
It's tasty, right?

1412
00:54:53.449 --> 00:54:54.648
This is...

1413
00:54:54.649 --> 00:54:55.657
(They move their hands
busily to deep the sauce.)

1414
00:54:55.658 --> 00:54:57.018
- This is crazy.
- Pasta sauce.

1415
00:54:57.019 --> 00:54:58.558
- It's tasty, right?
- Cream pasta.

1416
00:54:58.559 --> 00:54:59.628
It tastes like cream pasta.

1417
00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:01.328
How does it taste so wonderful?

1418
00:55:02.328 --> 00:55:03.358
It's tasty.

1419
00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:07.098
(Tae Gon drinks the innards.)

1420
00:55:07.598 --> 00:55:09.539
- It's like hangover soup.
- That's what.

1421
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:13.168
One of ingredients I wanted
to taste in the jungle was...

1422
00:55:13.169 --> 00:55:14.368
the coconut crab.

1423
00:55:14.669 --> 00:55:17.178
I've never seen crab as big as that,

1424
00:55:17.578 --> 00:55:20.098
but I couldn't believe how innards
could be eaten as the sauce.

1425
00:55:20.578 --> 00:55:22.948
They were sweet and perfectly seasoned.

1426
00:55:23.278 --> 00:55:26.048
That was my first time
tasting a coconut crab.

1427
00:55:26.419 --> 00:55:27.948
The innards were tasty,

1428
00:55:28.388 --> 00:55:32.487
but when I dipped it with the
crab meat, it was amazing.

1429
00:55:32.488 --> 00:55:34.959
Shouldn't we mix rice in this sauce?

1430
00:55:35.859 --> 00:55:39.128
We ate it when we were starving,
and I cannot forget...

1431
00:55:39.129 --> 00:55:40.999
how delicious it was.

1432
00:55:41.229 --> 00:55:45.138
I think now I truly understand
the real taste of crabs.

1433
00:55:45.368 --> 00:55:48.378
I'm going to eat all of the coconut crabs.

1434
00:55:48.379 --> 00:55:49.677
(She shows off her cute act.)

1435
00:55:49.678 --> 00:55:52.277
I'm really sorry. I'm truly sorry.

1436
00:55:52.278 --> 00:55:54.749
Viewers, I apologize.

1437
00:55:55.278 --> 00:55:58.048
The moment I ate this, I knew we
were in the Garden of Spirits.

1438
00:55:58.488 --> 00:56:01.589
Hadn't we tasted this, it wouldn't
have been the Garden of Spirits.

1439
00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:02.859
Right on.

1440
00:56:03.488 --> 00:56:04.488
I was surprised.

1441
00:56:04.689 --> 00:56:06.359
This is amazing.

1442
00:56:06.828 --> 00:56:09.028
- All we did was steam it.
- Exactly.

1443
00:56:09.059 --> 00:56:11.258
I'm full although I feel
like I haven't eaten a lot.

1444
00:56:11.629 --> 00:56:14.268
- Imagine if we didn't have these.
- You're right.

1445
00:56:14.269 --> 00:56:16.097
It would have been really hard.

1446
00:56:16.098 --> 00:56:17.468
(Kang Nam keeps on eating.)

1447
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:19.867
- This might explode.
- Doesn't it taste like pasta?

1448
00:56:19.868 --> 00:56:21.737
- It tastes just like pasta.
- You can't see this, can you?

1449
00:56:21.738 --> 00:56:23.379
He has the food all over his mouth.

1450
00:56:24.238 --> 00:56:25.248
(Looking dirty)

1451
00:56:25.249 --> 00:56:27.309
This is the tastiest.

1452
00:56:28.008 --> 00:56:29.018
Goodness.

1453
00:56:29.019 --> 00:56:30.619
(Kang Nam seems especially dirty today.)

1454
00:56:31.019 --> 00:56:33.848
("Kang Nam in the Jungle")

1455
00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:39.928
(Do you remember the days
when times were tough?)

1456
00:56:41.129 --> 00:56:44.157
- What is this?
- You can eat it. It's stuck.

1457
00:56:44.158 --> 00:56:46.228
(There lived a guy in the jungle,
wearing a plastic coat.)

1458
00:56:46.229 --> 00:56:48.838
(Perhaps, he likes the food he
has tasted for the first time.)

1459
00:56:48.839 --> 00:56:52.668
(He keeps on eating as he spills
and gets it all over his mouth.)

1460
00:56:52.669 --> 00:56:56.838
(It seems there's no more
food for him to consume.)

1461
00:56:56.839 --> 00:57:00.078
(However, he doesn't give up.)

1462
00:57:00.479 --> 00:57:01.479
(Feeling sad)

1463
00:57:01.879 --> 00:57:04.249
Kang Nam, stop licking the shells.

1464
00:57:06.218 --> 00:57:08.387
- There's nothing left anymore.
- I feel so much better now.

1465
00:57:08.388 --> 00:57:10.289
Hey, there's nothing
left for you to eat now.

1466
00:57:12.388 --> 00:57:14.288
(It seems Bo Mi can't get
enough of it as well.)

1467
00:57:14.289 --> 00:57:15.828
- Look at that.
- You will crack it.

1468
00:57:15.959 --> 00:57:17.119
You're almost done with that.

1469
00:57:18.028 --> 00:57:19.028
I'm done with this.

1470
00:57:19.028 --> 00:57:20.028
(Wanting more)

1471
00:57:21.298 --> 00:57:23.237
Where could we experience
this kind of luxury?

1472
00:57:23.238 --> 00:57:25.638
(Is there any more meat left here?)

1473
00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.138
There's nothing here.

1474
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:29.749
Bo Mi looks like she's very disappointed.

1475
00:57:30.178 --> 00:57:31.577
(She breaks into a bitter smile.)

1476
00:57:31.578 --> 00:57:33.908
Gosh, this was delicious.

1477
00:57:34.678 --> 00:57:36.379
- Gosh, this surprised me.
- Why?

1478
00:57:37.379 --> 00:57:40.987
- It was such a pleasant surprise.
- Are you done with this?

1479
00:57:40.988 --> 00:57:42.995
- Dam looks so cool right now.
- We're done with this.

1480
00:57:43.019 --> 00:57:44.059
There's nothing here.

1481
00:57:44.988 --> 00:57:46.459
We can catch more tomorrow.

1482
00:57:46.988 --> 00:57:49.757
- Dam, I really enjoyed it.
- Gosh, that was really tasty.

1483
00:57:49.758 --> 00:57:51.728
If Dam weren't here, we wouldn't
have known how to eat them.

1484
00:57:51.729 --> 00:57:53.899
- How would we have known?
- Exactly. When you...

1485
00:57:54.098 --> 00:57:56.698
- got innards out, you looked cool.
- No, you would've gotten it.

1486
00:57:56.769 --> 00:57:59.169
- Let's give up for him.
- Seriously.

1487
00:57:59.638 --> 00:58:01.538
- He's feeling shy.
- I think this is the best thing...

1488
00:58:01.539 --> 00:58:03.238
you've done so far.

1489
00:58:03.979 --> 00:58:04.979
I agree.

1490
00:58:05.278 --> 00:58:07.048
Byung Man had done it for us before.

1491
00:58:07.249 --> 00:58:10.478
I sort of understood how Byung Man
had felt when he gave us food.

1492
00:58:10.479 --> 00:58:13.188
How should I put it? It felt
like I became their mother.

1493
00:58:13.189 --> 00:58:15.688
It was heartwarming and rewarding.

1494
00:58:15.689 --> 00:58:20.229
Besides, I spotted, caught,
and gave the coconut crabs.

1495
00:58:20.559 --> 00:58:23.320
So I got a glimpse of the feeling
he must've felt during those times.

1496
00:58:23.758 --> 00:58:25.838
- Let's sleep. It's time for bed.
- We should sleep.

1497
00:58:26.198 --> 00:58:28.569
Thanks to Dam, the Tribe
could fill their stomachs.

1498
00:58:29.238 --> 00:58:30.638
Now that they are full,

1499
00:58:30.669 --> 00:58:32.938
- I bet they'll sleep well tonight.
- Great job today.

1500
00:58:32.939 --> 00:58:33.939
- Good work.
- Great job.

1501
00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.109
1, 2, 3.

1502
00:58:35.138 --> 00:58:37.578
(Bo Mi is happy after having a nice meal.)

1503
00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:41.479
All right. It's time for
them to wrap up their day.

1504
00:58:41.678 --> 00:58:43.677
They get ready for bed in a hurry.

1505
00:58:43.678 --> 00:58:46.487
(The Tribe is getting
ready to go to sleep.)

1506
00:58:46.488 --> 00:58:48.258
(Do we really sleep here?)

1507
00:58:50.158 --> 00:58:51.559
How was your day today?

1508
00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:56.598
I think this is going to be an
unforgettable memory later on.

1509
00:58:57.229 --> 00:59:00.899
I must say Ha Young and Eun Ji were
incredible for starring on the show.

1510
00:59:01.229 --> 00:59:05.769
The best part of today was... I'm
not saying it because I was hungry.

1511
00:59:06.638 --> 00:59:08.738
It was really good.

1512
00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:09.879
The food we ate.

1513
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.038
(Food takes 1st place.)

1514
00:59:11.039 --> 00:59:13.649
- What was the name? King crabs?
- You mean coconut crabs?

1515
00:59:13.678 --> 00:59:15.819
Yes, coconut crabs.

1516
00:59:16.419 --> 00:59:17.419
They were amazing.

1517
00:59:19.118 --> 00:59:22.559
It rained the whole day, so
the ground is still wet.

1518
00:59:22.888 --> 00:59:26.658
I didn't bring any blanket or pillow.

1519
00:59:26.689 --> 00:59:27.828
My head hurts.

1520
00:59:28.658 --> 00:59:30.858
- Wait.
- What if our head hurts tomorrow?

1521
00:59:30.859 --> 00:59:32.259
(They're worried about their head.)

1522
00:59:32.798 --> 00:59:35.238
But I really had no idea that
we would be sleeping like this.

1523
00:59:36.269 --> 00:59:38.867
If we didn't build the house, we
would've slept on the ground?

1524
00:59:38.868 --> 00:59:39.868
Yes.

1525
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:41.237
(No way.)

1526
00:59:41.238 --> 00:59:44.238
You didn't let us bring the sleeping bag.

1527
00:59:44.749 --> 00:59:45.847
(She's mad...)

1528
00:59:45.848 --> 00:59:47.378
(and upset.)

1529
00:59:47.379 --> 00:59:48.979
I'm starting to hate you guys.

1530
00:59:50.118 --> 00:59:51.749
Good night.

1531
00:59:52.249 --> 00:59:53.689
Great job today.

1532
00:59:53.848 --> 00:59:55.359
Good work.

1533
00:59:59.528 --> 01:00:01.229
It's their first night in the jungle.

1534
01:00:01.528 --> 01:00:05.868
They must have been exhausted.
It got quiet very quickly.

1535
01:00:06.968 --> 01:00:08.498
Good night, Tribe.

1536
01:00:08.499 --> 01:00:10.539
(Have a good first night
in the Garden of Spirits.)

1537
01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:14.137
(The wind blows hard.)

1538
01:00:14.138 --> 01:00:15.778
(Flapping)

1539
01:00:16.539 --> 01:00:19.577
(It gets windier when it's dawn.)

1540
01:00:19.578 --> 01:00:20.677
(At that moment)

1541
01:00:20.678 --> 01:00:21.678
(Falling)

1542
01:00:23.479 --> 01:00:24.748
What just happened?

1543
01:00:24.749 --> 01:00:25.847
(The plastic roof has collapsed.)

1544
01:00:25.848 --> 01:00:30.158
The plastic roof that was protecting
the fire fell due to rain and wind.

1545
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:33.528
If this continues, the
fire will go out soon.

1546
01:00:34.189 --> 01:00:36.198
(Someone has woken up?)

1547
01:00:39.328 --> 01:00:40.428
It was too cold.

1548
01:00:40.729 --> 01:00:42.249
I was cold even with my padded jacket.

1549
01:00:42.769 --> 01:00:45.238
I had to fix the fire too.

1550
01:00:46.868 --> 01:00:50.577
(Yun Hyeong installs the
roof at a lower height.)

1551
01:00:50.578 --> 01:00:54.178
(He continues to observe it out of worry.)

1552
01:00:54.649 --> 01:00:58.148
Thanks to his effort, he stopped
the fire from going out.

1553
01:00:58.149 --> 01:01:00.188
(With his effort, the Tribe manages
to avoid the worst scenario.)

1554
01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:04.359
However, they cannot stop the
pouring rain as the time passes.

1555
01:01:05.129 --> 01:01:08.027
Even the waves are getting
closer to their base camp.

1556
01:01:08.028 --> 01:01:10.027
(The waves are reaching close.)

1557
01:01:10.028 --> 01:01:14.669
Can they spend the first night
in the Garden of Spirits safely?

1558
01:01:17.098 --> 01:01:20.568
(Despite the worry, )

1559
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:22.578
(the dawn breaks soon.)

1560
01:01:24.008 --> 01:01:26.878
(It continues to rain even in the morning.)

1561
01:01:26.879 --> 01:01:28.778
(Everyone is sleeping like a rock.)

1562
01:01:30.749 --> 01:01:32.888
(So far, the morning seems peaceful.)

1563
01:01:35.218 --> 01:01:39.028
(The waves have reached right
up to their base camp.)

1564
01:01:39.528 --> 01:01:42.499
Now that it's morning, the sea
seems to be in an unusual state.

1565
01:01:45.269 --> 01:01:49.637
(In the end, )

1566
01:01:49.638 --> 01:01:52.269
(the waves crash over the breakwater.)

1567
01:01:52.839 --> 01:01:55.478
The waves sweep away the bonfire.

1568
01:01:55.479 --> 01:02:01.048
(This is the crew's tent.)

1569
01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:07.548
What's worse is that the waves
have slammed onto the crew's tent.

1570
01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:12.589
(Luckily, the waves didn't
sweep over Tribe's house.)

1571
01:02:14.258 --> 01:02:16.858
(However, their house is
hanging by a single thread.)

1572
01:02:16.859 --> 01:02:20.027
(The fearful waves are nearing.)

1573
01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:22.508
(The waves crash over the whole
place except for their house.)

1574
01:02:26.238 --> 01:02:27.467
(The waves are about to
slam onto their house.)

1575
01:02:27.468 --> 01:02:30.678
The Tribe's house isn't safe anymore.

1576
01:02:30.839 --> 01:02:33.879
It seems the waves are only a few
seconds away from sweeping over it.

1577
01:02:35.249 --> 01:02:37.479
(Moon Sik wakes up at
an impeccable timing.)

1578
01:02:40.218 --> 01:02:41.248
(He intuits they are in danger.)

1579
01:02:41.249 --> 01:02:43.518
Gosh, I couldn't get a wink of sleep.

1580
01:02:43.519 --> 01:02:47.289
The waves reached all the way here.
It was cold too.

1581
01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:51.498
I'm glad our house didn't float away.

1582
01:02:51.499 --> 01:02:52.927
(They are lucky the house is intact.)

1583
01:02:52.928 --> 01:02:54.568
The waves reached all the
way up to the house.

1584
01:02:54.569 --> 01:02:55.768
(The mess...)

1585
01:02:55.769 --> 01:02:57.868
(even flustered the experienced member.)

1586
01:02:58.738 --> 01:03:00.309
(Jin Woon is the second to wake up.)

1587
01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:04.638
(As soon as he wakes up, he's shocked.)

1588
01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:09.178
(What is this breakwater doing here?)

1589
01:03:09.649 --> 01:03:12.589
The waves must've gotten all the way here.
Close enough to push the log.

1590
01:03:13.249 --> 01:03:14.289
You're up.

1591
01:03:15.689 --> 01:03:17.265
How can the waves reach all the way here?

1592
01:03:17.289 --> 01:03:18.449
How are we going to fix this?

1593
01:03:18.959 --> 01:03:22.958
(While these two experienced members
are in a state of confusion, )

1594
01:03:22.959 --> 01:03:24.358
(in the end...)

1595
01:03:24.359 --> 01:03:25.368
(Startled)

1596
01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:30.039
(The waves are coming at
them with increasing vigor.)

1597
01:03:32.738 --> 01:03:36.577
(The Tribe are in direct
contact of the waves.)

1598
01:03:36.578 --> 01:03:39.508
(It's a catastrophe of the morning.)

1599
01:03:42.379 --> 01:03:45.048
(The waves keep on crashing at them.)

1600
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:52.527
(The entire Tribe wakes up as
they can't defend themselves.)

1601
01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:54.999
(The whole group is in a mental breakdown.)

1602
01:03:57.658 --> 01:04:01.297
(Is this really happening?
Or am I still dreaming?)

1603
01:04:01.298 --> 01:04:05.169
(They are calming their shocked nerves.)

1604
01:04:06.939 --> 01:04:09.109
- You could have floated away.
- Sorry?

1605
01:04:09.238 --> 01:04:11.598
You could've been swept away.
The waves reached up to here.

1606
01:04:12.508 --> 01:04:14.208
- Really?
- Over there.

1607
01:04:14.209 --> 01:04:17.649
(They are checking the
ruins of the catastrophe.)

1608
01:04:19.749 --> 01:04:23.018
(The threat of the waves doesn't stop.)

1609
01:04:23.019 --> 01:04:26.789
(Still drowsy from their sleep, they
let the waves sweep over them.)

1610
01:04:27.928 --> 01:04:31.399
I think this is how it feels to
suffer from the rainfall disaster.

1611
01:04:32.028 --> 01:04:33.999
I don't know where to start.

1612
01:04:35.499 --> 01:04:37.738
(It's certainly a gloomy and
tragic feeling to have.)

1613
01:04:38.738 --> 01:04:41.138
(They begin to move 1 by 1 as
they gather their senses.)

1614
01:04:43.339 --> 01:04:45.248
(Strong waves slammed into them.)

1615
01:04:45.249 --> 01:04:46.249
(Shouting)

1616
01:04:47.278 --> 01:04:50.078
(He fell over the log the
moment he let down his guard.)

1617
01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:55.788
(Even the cameraman staggers,
swept by the waves.)

1618
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:57.757
(However, they mustn't
lower their guard yet.)

1619
01:04:57.758 --> 01:04:59.987
(Running)

1620
01:04:59.988 --> 01:05:02.558
(My shoes are floating away.)

1621
01:05:02.559 --> 01:05:07.367
(Luckily, he manages to retrieve them.)

1622
01:05:07.368 --> 01:05:10.038
(The waves make their blood curdle.)

1623
01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.238
My feet got pinned by the tree.

1624
01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:16.308
(The sea is not forgiving.)

1625
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:18.879
(The staff's tent got destroyed too.)

1626
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:21.309
What do we do?

1627
01:05:21.778 --> 01:05:25.447
I've lost all my motivation to repair it.

1628
01:05:25.448 --> 01:05:26.689
(This is tragic.)

1629
01:05:27.848 --> 01:05:30.359
It's getting worse.

1630
01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:35.697
There was a thud and the
waves hit Dam and me.

1631
01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:37.129
We both got up.

1632
01:05:37.658 --> 01:05:40.467
We were wondering what it was.
I thought somebody hit us.

1633
01:05:40.468 --> 01:05:41.568
(They couldn't have imagined this.)

1634
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:42.598
There was a big thud.

1635
01:05:43.999 --> 01:05:47.138
It was gloomy. We didn't have an answer.

1636
01:05:48.008 --> 01:05:49.608
We lost fire.

1637
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:51.677
We put our shoes at the bottom...

1638
01:05:51.678 --> 01:05:53.879
and they got soaked and swept away.

1639
01:05:54.649 --> 01:05:57.019
There was water coming in...

1640
01:05:57.848 --> 01:05:59.388
underneath our house.

1641
01:06:00.019 --> 01:06:02.519
I wanted to cry.

1642
01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:07.027
It attacked our fireplace
so the flame went out.

1643
01:06:07.028 --> 01:06:08.028
(Moon Sik got up first
but he was helpless.)

1644
01:06:08.029 --> 01:06:10.927
Were we supposed to build a house again?

1645
01:06:10.928 --> 01:06:13.367
Were we supposed to move it back?
It was hopeless.

1646
01:06:13.368 --> 01:06:15.097
(He feels hopeless.)

1647
01:06:15.098 --> 01:06:16.538
Due to the rain that
poured all night long...

1648
01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:18.367
and the changing tide,

1649
01:06:18.368 --> 01:06:20.868
the sea level rose
significantly within a day.

1650
01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:24.577
It put Byung Man's Tribe's shelter...

1651
01:06:24.578 --> 01:06:25.978
in danger.

1652
01:06:25.979 --> 01:06:28.848
(How will they overcome this obstacle?)

1653
01:06:30.149 --> 01:06:35.088
(They lay the breakwater down
again to amend the situation.)

1654
01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:37.757
(They start lighting a fire again.)

1655
01:06:37.758 --> 01:06:40.128
(It's close.)

1656
01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.188
It's working.

1657
01:06:41.189 --> 01:06:44.658
(Wood is wet so it's not
easy to light it again.)

1658
01:06:45.629 --> 01:06:48.938
(Bo Mi gives it a try.)

1659
01:06:48.939 --> 01:06:50.069
(It's not working.)

1660
01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:54.208
(I wish it didn't rain.)

1661
01:06:54.209 --> 01:06:58.277
(Cho Rong comes back with an idea.)

1662
01:06:58.278 --> 01:07:00.777
(Jin Woon helps as well.)

1663
01:07:00.778 --> 01:07:03.177
(Ticking)

1664
01:07:03.178 --> 01:07:04.218
It worked.

1665
01:07:06.749 --> 01:07:08.888
(They finally get some ember.)

1666
01:07:09.488 --> 01:07:11.089
(I'm so good.)

1667
01:07:12.559 --> 01:07:13.559
It worked.

1668
01:07:15.199 --> 01:07:17.528
Our wishes came together.

1669
01:07:17.529 --> 01:07:18.967
We came together as one.

1670
01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:23.368
(Their hope for survival burns
as their wishes come together.)

1671
01:07:23.369 --> 01:07:24.467
(It's low tide now and the
waves are moving back.)

1672
01:07:24.468 --> 01:07:27.168
- Let's have cassavas and bananas.
- Let's have bananas.

1673
01:07:28.138 --> 01:07:29.178
We caught these yesterday.

1674
01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:31.707
They're like freshwater snails.

1675
01:07:31.708 --> 01:07:33.747
(They saved the gastropods for breakfast.)

1676
01:07:33.748 --> 01:07:34.978
We saved them for breakfast.

1677
01:07:34.979 --> 01:07:36.678
(She washes them with sea water.)

1678
01:07:39.418 --> 01:07:40.489
It's good.

1679
01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:44.189
(It goes on the fire.)

1680
01:07:45.059 --> 01:07:46.888
(Here are some cassavas too.)

1681
01:07:48.159 --> 01:07:50.627
We're lucky we have cassavas and bananas.

1682
01:07:50.628 --> 01:07:52.199
- We have them.
- We have more.

1683
01:07:52.798 --> 01:07:54.498
This is enough. I think we can eat.

1684
01:07:55.498 --> 01:07:56.667
Sit.

1685
01:07:56.668 --> 01:07:57.668
(It's time to eat.)

1686
01:07:58.968 --> 01:08:00.608
Look at these.

1687
01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:03.177
(The warm steam rises.)

1688
01:08:03.178 --> 01:08:04.238
That looks great.

1689
01:08:04.239 --> 01:08:05.449
We have food for breakfast.

1690
01:08:06.909 --> 01:08:08.047
- The sea.
- There's a scent.

1691
01:08:08.048 --> 01:08:09.079
It's from the sea.

1692
01:08:09.748 --> 01:08:11.428
The freshwater and the sea ones are mixed.

1693
01:08:12.149 --> 01:08:13.449
It's so good.

1694
01:08:14.189 --> 01:08:15.189
It's so sweet.

1695
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:17.059
(Bo Mi has breakfast too.)

1696
01:08:17.258 --> 01:08:19.758
It was a tough morning,

1697
01:08:20.159 --> 01:08:21.957
but they had a filling breakfast.

1698
01:08:21.958 --> 01:08:24.457
Byung Man's Tribe renewed
their will for survival.

1699
01:08:24.458 --> 01:08:26.045
(They have a renewed will for survival.)

1700
01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:27.198
Open it, Kang Nam.

1701
01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:30.297
Are these cassavas?

1702
01:08:30.298 --> 01:08:31.458
You haven't had these, right?

1703
01:08:32.468 --> 01:08:34.168
It's good.

1704
01:08:35.038 --> 01:08:37.808
The food probably tastes better
after what they've been through.

1705
01:08:37.809 --> 01:08:40.078
(They get rewarded for
having the worst morning.)

1706
01:08:40.079 --> 01:08:41.778
They have recharged themselves,

1707
01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:44.649
so they start repairing
the house right away.

1708
01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:46.764
We should have done this before it rained.

1709
01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.457
(They didn't know it was
going to rain this much.)

1710
01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:50.018
We realized after it rained.

1711
01:08:50.019 --> 01:08:53.729
They upgrade the bamboo house
so that no rain gets through.

1712
01:08:54.388 --> 01:08:56.699
(They are in charge of the fire.)

1713
01:08:57.529 --> 01:08:58.927
(However)

1714
01:08:58.928 --> 01:08:59.967
(7 people?)

1715
01:08:59.968 --> 01:09:04.699
(Where's Cho Rong?)

1716
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:10.337
(She sat down with her eyes covered.)

1717
01:09:10.338 --> 01:09:11.808
(Oh, no)

1718
01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:12.878
What's this?

1719
01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:16.979
If I look straight,

1720
01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:18.847
it hurts.

1721
01:09:18.848 --> 01:09:20.168
(The team doctor checks her out.)

1722
01:09:20.418 --> 01:09:21.458
My goodness.

1723
01:09:22.588 --> 01:09:25.659
(What happened to her?)

1724
01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:27.888
It's not blurry, right?

1725
01:09:28.059 --> 01:09:31.198
(She felt discomfort since breakfast.)

1726
01:09:31.199 --> 01:09:32.229
My eyes hurt.

1727
01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:35.497
What's wrong with my eyes?

1728
01:09:35.498 --> 01:09:36.498
(Why does she have pain?)

1729
01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:41.608
(She can't open her eyes.)

1730
01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:46.109
(She's trying to bear the pain.)

1731
01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:50.778
(It's best to relax.)

1732
01:09:50.779 --> 01:09:53.448
(The team doctor looks after her.)

1733
01:09:53.449 --> 01:09:54.888
(Groaning)

1734
01:09:57.689 --> 01:09:58.689
(Her fists are clenched.)

1735
01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:02.497
My eye started stinging all of a sudden.

1736
01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:05.968
I thought it was ashes,

1737
01:10:06.729 --> 01:10:09.798
so I was going to wash it away,

1738
01:10:10.399 --> 01:10:11.739
but my eye started swelling.

1739
01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:17.708
I had ashes in my eyes since last night.

1740
01:10:18.208 --> 01:10:20.479
I was trying to keep the fire alive.

1741
01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:24.547
In Cho Rong's case,

1742
01:10:24.548 --> 01:10:27.047
she was in front of the bonfire...

1743
01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:30.787
when her eye started
hurting and tearing up.

1744
01:10:30.788 --> 01:10:33.127
She probably had ashes
or debris in her eyes...

1745
01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:34.688
that led to the situation.

1746
01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:39.729
(She was protecting the fire
when she felt the pain.)

1747
01:10:41.468 --> 01:10:44.438
It happened to other members before too,

1748
01:10:44.439 --> 01:10:47.637
so we had necessary medicine ready.

1749
01:10:47.638 --> 01:10:50.377
I gave her eye drops and applied ointment.

1750
01:10:50.378 --> 01:10:51.498
I think it's getting better.

1751
01:10:52.878 --> 01:10:54.008
What's this?

1752
01:10:54.348 --> 01:10:58.217
(It's fortunate she got treated early.)

1753
01:10:58.218 --> 01:11:01.287
(But there's still pain.)

1754
01:11:01.288 --> 01:11:04.488
(They have to watch and see
how soon she improves.)

1755
01:11:04.489 --> 01:11:06.189
(Is it better now?)

1756
01:11:08.359 --> 01:11:09.528
(Tae Gon gets worried and comes over.)

1757
01:11:09.529 --> 01:11:10.559
What's that matter?

1758
01:11:11.428 --> 01:11:12.788
Did you get something in your eye?

1759
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:16.167
- Did you get something in your eye?
- I can't open my eyes.

1760
01:11:16.168 --> 01:11:18.338
(I can't open my eyes.)

1761
01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:20.468
She got eye drops.

1762
01:11:21.138 --> 01:11:24.408
(Cho Rong was always so strong, )

1763
01:11:24.409 --> 01:11:26.678
(so they're more worried about her.)

1764
01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.007
(2 hours later)

1765
01:11:28.008 --> 01:11:29.019
How's the weather?

1766
01:11:29.748 --> 01:11:31.148
(Cho Rong is taking a
rest inside the tent.)

1767
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:32.618
- Cho Rong.
- Yes?

1768
01:11:32.619 --> 01:11:34.248
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1769
01:11:34.649 --> 01:11:35.689
Are you better now?

1770
01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:38.189
What's everybody doing?

1771
01:11:38.788 --> 01:11:41.597
We're just sitting down and resting.

1772
01:11:41.598 --> 01:11:43.598
- We made the grill.
- Really?

1773
01:11:44.869 --> 01:11:46.467
We're resting now.

1774
01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:48.228
(Bo Mi emphasizes that
they're resting too.)

1775
01:11:50.138 --> 01:11:53.368
(She gets her a thick jacket
in case she gets cold.)

1776
01:11:53.369 --> 01:11:55.439
- This is yours, right?
- Yes. Thank you.

1777
01:11:56.609 --> 01:11:58.278
She has something in her eyes.

1778
01:11:58.279 --> 01:11:59.378
(She's sad.)

1779
01:12:00.208 --> 01:12:01.208
So...

1780
01:12:01.209 --> 01:12:02.717
(She's worried about Cho Rong.)

1781
01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:04.319
But she'll get better.

1782
01:12:06.319 --> 01:12:11.428
I thought of covering
one eye and keep going,

1783
01:12:11.829 --> 01:12:15.427
but I thought I might have to go home...

1784
01:12:15.428 --> 01:12:17.798
after one day in the jungle.

1785
01:12:18.428 --> 01:12:20.369
I was a little bit shocked.

1786
01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:25.968
I felt bad lying down the whole time.
I didn't feel good.

1787
01:12:26.638 --> 01:12:27.837
(She injured herself
while making the fire.)

1788
01:12:27.838 --> 01:12:30.377
I was sad. Why did I come...

1789
01:12:30.378 --> 01:12:32.149
if I was going to return in a day?

1790
01:12:32.779 --> 01:12:33.809
Did you cry?

1791
01:12:34.309 --> 01:12:37.048
I got really sad so I
wept when I was alone.

1792
01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:41.558
I don't want to cry.

1793
01:12:41.559 --> 01:12:45.559
(It still makes her tear
up thinking about it.)

1794
01:12:47.859 --> 01:12:54.097
(Will Cho Rong recover quickly?)

1795
01:12:54.098 --> 01:12:55.137
My gosh.

1796
01:12:55.138 --> 01:12:56.738
(Will Cho Rong recover quickly?)

1797
01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:57.798
(Next week)

1798
01:12:58.269 --> 01:12:59.938
(The survival continues.)

1799
01:12:59.939 --> 01:13:01.507
(Tae Gon and Dam look for marlins.)

1800
01:13:01.508 --> 01:13:03.677
(They face the extraordinary
Mother Nature.)

1801
01:13:03.678 --> 01:13:06.748
(They feel it with their body.)

1802
01:13:06.848 --> 01:13:10.979
(It's the Garden of the
Spirits that they dreamt of.)

1803
01:13:13.248 --> 01:13:14.787
We need the spirits.

1804
01:13:14.788 --> 01:13:16.758
(The Law of Jungle, next Friday at 10pm)
