1
00:00:16.156 --> 00:00:17.226
What's that?

2
00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:32.805
Hey, Goo Gil.

3
00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:34.406
Hey, Pil.

4
00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:37.775
This guy here is beating someone up.

5
00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:40.845
- An assault? - Yes, exactly.

6
00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:42.216
Where are you right now?

7
00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:46.586
I'm at the back alley of the supermarket.

8
00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:00.366
Pil.

9
00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:02.635
Give me a second.

10
00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:14.045
- Are you all right? - I'm sorry.

11
00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:15.586
Look at your face. Goodness.

12
00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:17.956
What do you want?

13
00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:30.965
Hello? Goo Gil. Goo Gil.

14
00:01:31.396 --> 00:01:32.736
Can you hear me?

15
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.575
Goo Gil. Goo Gil!

16
00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:16.146
Hello? Can you hear me?

17
00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:18.345
Goo Gil. Goo Gil.

18
00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:20.215
Hold on for a minute.

19
00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:22.815
Nothing is going on, and you're okay, right?

20
00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:25.815
You have to hold on. I'll be there soon.

21
00:02:27.055 --> 00:02:28.886
Hello? Can you hear me?

22
00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:31.796
Goo Gil, I'm nearby.

23
00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:33.766
Give me a moment.

24
00:02:34.965 --> 00:02:36.696
- Goo Gil. Goo Gil. - Bong Pil?

25
00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:40.965
Nothing's going on, right? Are you okay?

26
00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:50.315
Wait, what?

27
00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:52.116
Why did it have to be him?

28
00:02:55.845 --> 00:02:57.255
Goo Gil. Goo Gil!

29
00:03:03.426 --> 00:03:05.495
Goo Gil, wake up.

30
00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:06.766
Goo Gil.

31
00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:08.595
What happened to you?

32
00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:13.505
Is this the 911?

33
00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:15.005
A man is down.

34
00:03:15.065 --> 00:03:18.206
Yes, we are near 14 Hyehwa-dong.

35
00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:19.775
Yes, come quickly.

36
00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:20.775
(Episode 13)

37
00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:06.625
Did you know a lot about Jae Hyun before marriage?

38
00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.086
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

39
00:04:08.086 --> 00:04:09.486
I was wondering...

40
00:04:09.486 --> 00:04:11.495
if you got married to him after getting to know him.

41
00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:13.766
I'm not entirely sure if he's a good man.

42
00:04:14.565 --> 00:04:16.566
He may be good to you on the surface,

43
00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:18.865
but I'm sure there is something you don't know.

44
00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:24.775
Jae Hyun.

45
00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:27.345
- You're home late. - Yes.

46
00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:30.545
Why are you sweating so much?

47
00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:33.946
I ran home so I could do some exercise.

48
00:04:34.045 --> 00:04:35.485
I see.

49
00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:41.756
Yes?

50
00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:46.126
What? Goo Gil's hurt?

51
00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:49.996
Yes. Okay.

52
00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:52.795
What is it?

53
00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:54.235
What do I do, Jae Hyun?

54
00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:56.365
Goo Gil got assaulted.

55
00:04:56.365 --> 00:04:57.775
He's in the hospital.

56
00:04:57.775 --> 00:05:00.306
- What? - I need to go see him.

57
00:05:00.775 --> 00:05:02.775
- Okay, let's go. - Okay.

58
00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:10.256
Yes, it's me.

59
00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:12.215
I brought the assault victim...

60
00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:13.655
to a hospital.

61
00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:16.025
I'm with the victim.

62
00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:18.056
I'll call you back once I hear from the doctor.

63
00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:20.025
Okay.

64
00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:22.996
I administered first aid to the patient.

65
00:05:23.295 --> 00:05:24.365
Thank you.

66
00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.105
- Goo Gil! - Goo Gil.

67
00:05:34.975 --> 00:05:36.206
What happened?

68
00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:38.146
Goo Gil got assaulted.

69
00:05:38.646 --> 00:05:41.186
He witnessed an assault and called me.

70
00:05:41.386 --> 00:05:43.146
I think he got attacked too.

71
00:05:43.456 --> 00:05:45.516
How is he right now?

72
00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:47.186
He hasn't woken up yet,

73
00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:49.086
but I don't think it's a serious injury.

74
00:05:50.456 --> 00:05:53.126
Goo Gil.

75
00:05:54.425 --> 00:05:57.066
Goo Gil.

76
00:05:59.196 --> 00:06:01.035
- Hey. - Goo Gil.

77
00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:02.865
- Goo Gil. - Are you awake?

78
00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:08.076
Where am I?

79
00:06:08.545 --> 00:06:09.876
You're in a hospital.

80
00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:13.215
Pil found you and brought you here.

81
00:06:14.485 --> 00:06:15.746
Goo Gil, are you okay?

82
00:06:16.045 --> 00:06:17.355
Yes, I'm okay.

83
00:06:18.186 --> 00:06:20.086
- I'll get... - No.

84
00:06:20.086 --> 00:06:22.586
Goo Gil. Don't move.

85
00:06:22.586 --> 00:06:23.996
You need to have more tests.

86
00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:27.425
Look at your face.

87
00:06:28.525 --> 00:06:30.365
You should've ran away.

88
00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:32.165
Why did you get involved?

89
00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:35.136
How can I run away when someone's being attacked?

90
00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:38.605
Do you remember anything about the assailant?

91
00:06:39.206 --> 00:06:40.506
Did you see his face?

92
00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:42.376
No.

93
00:06:43.045 --> 00:06:45.675
It all happened so fast.

94
00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:53.485
Guys.

95
00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:54.985
- Soo Jin. - Soo Jin.

96
00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:56.655
Are you all right?

97
00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.295
Why did you come? It's nothing serious.

98
00:07:01.425 --> 00:07:04.196
I heard you got hurt. How could I not come?

99
00:07:06.095 --> 00:07:07.965
Jae Hyun, you came too.

100
00:07:08.006 --> 00:07:10.675
Of course. I was really worried about you.

101
00:07:10.675 --> 00:07:12.235
Thank you...

102
00:07:12.836 --> 00:07:14.475
for coming.

103
00:07:14.675 --> 00:07:16.516
Thank goodness you didn't get hurt more.

104
00:07:17.845 --> 00:07:20.215
By the way, did you catch the culprit?

105
00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:22.686
No, not yet.

106
00:07:24.415 --> 00:07:25.485
Goo Gil.

107
00:07:25.956 --> 00:07:28.186
I'll catch him no matter what.

108
00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:29.826
Don't worry.

109
00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:33.996
I have to go back to the scene.

110
00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:36.165
My colleagues must be there by now.

111
00:07:36.326 --> 00:07:38.436
Please take good care of him.

112
00:07:38.436 --> 00:07:41.035
Pil, be careful.

113
00:07:44.336 --> 00:07:46.235
- Bye. - Be careful.

114
00:07:48.545 --> 00:07:50.415
I can't believe this.

115
00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:51.646
What happened?

116
00:07:51.646 --> 00:07:53.485
I'm not sure.

117
00:07:53.485 --> 00:07:54.915
Goodness.

118
00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:04.396
Gosh. Please get out of the way.

119
00:08:07.896 --> 00:08:09.066
How is the victim?

120
00:08:09.066 --> 00:08:10.235
He didn't get any serious injury.

121
00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:11.965
I left after I saw him wake up.

122
00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:14.735
Did you find any evidence?

123
00:08:14.735 --> 00:08:16.936
No. Nothing at all. It's perfectly clean.

124
00:08:16.936 --> 00:08:19.035
He's terribly cunning.

125
00:08:31.516 --> 00:08:33.985
We need to check that surveillance camera.

126
00:08:35.456 --> 00:08:37.026
(Police)

127
00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:53.375
Wait.

128
00:08:54.406 --> 00:08:56.145
This guy is suspicious.

129
00:08:56.375 --> 00:08:58.176
Yes. Other than the victims,

130
00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:01.345
he's the only person who entered the scene.

131
00:09:01.745 --> 00:09:03.416
Zoom in.

132
00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:07.426
He's slim.

133
00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:09.786
He's about 180cm tall.

134
00:09:10.656 --> 00:09:13.125
His face is completely covered.

135
00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:17.166
It'd be nice if we have something more concrete.

136
00:09:17.696 --> 00:09:19.965
Let's go back to the scene...

137
00:09:19.965 --> 00:09:21.066
tomorrow morning.

138
00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:22.206
Yes, sir.

139
00:09:23.676 --> 00:09:25.576
He covered his whole face with a mask.

140
00:09:46.196 --> 00:09:47.666
There has been...

141
00:09:47.666 --> 00:09:49.895
another assault in the heart of Seoul.

142
00:09:50.365 --> 00:09:52.465
Last night, in a tunnel in Eunha-gu,

143
00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:56.066
a man assaulted Mr. Park for no reason.

144
00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:59.605
Then he attacked Mr. Yang, a witness.

145
00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:01.706
The police started an investigation.

146
00:10:02.406 --> 00:10:04.515
The police released...

147
00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:06.745
the surveillance video of the suspect...

148
00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:09.046
and announced him as being wanted.

149
00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:10.715
What are you watching?

150
00:10:10.755 --> 00:10:14.125
Jae Hyun. Goo Gil's case is on the news.

151
00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:17.556
The attacker was caught on tape.

152
00:10:17.725 --> 00:10:20.995
He was wearing a black cap and a black mask.

153
00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:23.696
Let's eat breakfast.

154
00:10:23.696 --> 00:10:25.036
- Okay. - The continuous...

155
00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:26.095
- assaults... - Wait.

156
00:10:26.906 --> 00:10:29.536
Jae Hyun, what happened to your neck?

157
00:10:29.536 --> 00:10:30.676
Did you get hurt?

158
00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:32.706
No, it's a shaving nick.

159
00:10:32.706 --> 00:10:35.546
That must hurt. Let me get some ointment.

160
00:10:35.546 --> 00:10:37.576
It's okay. I'll do it.

161
00:10:37.645 --> 00:10:39.245
- What? - Let's eat.

162
00:10:39.316 --> 00:10:41.145
Okay. It might leave a scar.

163
00:10:42.615 --> 00:10:44.316
There.

164
00:10:46.385 --> 00:10:49.086
Pil said he was on the case.

165
00:10:49.086 --> 00:10:50.355
Did he find anything?

166
00:10:50.355 --> 00:10:52.056
Well, I'm not sure.

167
00:10:52.056 --> 00:10:53.666
I haven't talked to him.

168
00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:55.326
I'll ask him when I see him.

169
00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:56.495
Okay.

170
00:10:56.895 --> 00:10:58.995
Jae Hyun, I'll get your suit out.

171
00:10:58.995 --> 00:11:00.235
Eat up.

172
00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:01.235
Okay.

173
00:11:08.745 --> 00:11:11.316
We secured a surveillance video.

174
00:11:11.316 --> 00:11:13.686
Was it this man?

175
00:11:15.845 --> 00:11:18.186
I'm not sure. I don't remember.

176
00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:21.355
He's dazed. Please catch the culprit.

177
00:11:21.586 --> 00:11:24.095
Hello. I have a question to ask you.

178
00:11:24.196 --> 00:11:26.965
There was an assault over there last night.

179
00:11:26.965 --> 00:11:28.326
I'm looking for a man.

180
00:11:28.426 --> 00:11:30.235
Have you seen this man?

181
00:11:31.036 --> 00:11:32.395
No.

182
00:11:33.066 --> 00:11:34.166
All right.

183
00:11:37.135 --> 00:11:39.436
Have you been waiting long?

184
00:11:39.436 --> 00:11:41.245
Hi, how are you?

185
00:11:41.245 --> 00:11:42.406
Not well.

186
00:11:42.406 --> 00:11:46.546
Did the attacker look like this?

187
00:11:46.885 --> 00:11:48.015
I'm not sure.

188
00:11:48.015 --> 00:11:50.215
I was completely out of it then.

189
00:12:10.706 --> 00:12:13.375
What? Goo Gil was assaulted?

190
00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:15.505
Yes. It was on the news.

191
00:12:16.446 --> 00:12:18.676
So that news was about Goo Gil?

192
00:12:19.176 --> 00:12:20.916
Goodness.

193
00:12:21.215 --> 00:12:22.786
Is Goo Gil okay?

194
00:12:22.786 --> 00:12:24.556
He's in the hospital.

195
00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:26.316
His injury isn't serious,

196
00:12:26.316 --> 00:12:27.625
but I was so shocked.

197
00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:30.225
Gosh, I can't believe it.

198
00:12:30.755 --> 00:12:33.395
What kind of madman would do that?

199
00:12:33.965 --> 00:12:35.166
I know.

200
00:12:35.666 --> 00:12:37.635
Don't go out at night.

201
00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:39.436
You be careful.

202
00:12:39.436 --> 00:12:42.536
Tell Jae Hyun to come home early.

203
00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:45.436
Even grown men are getting beat up.

204
00:12:45.436 --> 00:12:47.306
I don't feel safe.

205
00:12:47.706 --> 00:12:49.005
Me neither.

206
00:12:49.706 --> 00:12:51.916
I told Jae Hyun to close the pharmacy early.

207
00:12:52.245 --> 00:12:56.046
By the way, how are you and Jae Hyun doing?

208
00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:58.755
We're doing well.

209
00:13:00.056 --> 00:13:02.485
Be nice to Jae Hyun.

210
00:13:02.485 --> 00:13:04.255
I haven't seen anyone...

211
00:13:04.255 --> 00:13:06.196
as nice as Jae Hyun.

212
00:13:06.696 --> 00:13:08.666
Goodness, all right.

213
00:13:13.865 --> 00:13:14.965
This...

214
00:13:15.765 --> 00:13:18.105
is the kimchi and dried filefish Jae Hyun likes.

215
00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:20.105
Take them home with you.

216
00:13:20.105 --> 00:13:22.176
Yes! Thanks, Mom.

217
00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:24.515
I'll give some to Goo Gil too.

218
00:13:24.615 --> 00:13:25.745
All right.

219
00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:50.076
I think the juice truck is closed today.

220
00:13:50.306 --> 00:13:51.536
What happened?

221
00:13:52.536 --> 00:13:53.975
Can you call her and find out what happened?

222
00:13:53.975 --> 00:13:54.975
Yes, sir.

223
00:13:58.176 --> 00:13:59.176
Hello?

224
00:13:59.446 --> 00:14:02.115
Is the juice truck not open today?

225
00:14:02.186 --> 00:14:04.916
I want to order some drinks for our meeting.

226
00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:08.026
I see.

227
00:14:08.485 --> 00:14:10.796
Okay, bye.

228
00:14:11.595 --> 00:14:12.595
What did she say?

229
00:14:12.595 --> 00:14:14.326
She says it's closed for today.

230
00:14:16.696 --> 00:14:18.135
Did something happen?

231
00:14:20.666 --> 00:14:22.836
- Open up. - Okay.

232
00:14:27.105 --> 00:14:28.276
It's good to be hurt...

233
00:14:28.946 --> 00:14:30.745
because you feed me yourself like this.

234
00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:32.745
Shall I not recover?

235
00:14:32.845 --> 00:14:35.286
Stop the nonsense and eat up.

236
00:14:35.385 --> 00:14:37.215
Give me more meat.

237
00:14:38.885 --> 00:14:40.485
Here. Open up.

238
00:14:43.026 --> 00:14:44.355
You're eating.

239
00:14:44.826 --> 00:14:46.595
- You're here, Soo Jin. - Hi.

240
00:14:46.865 --> 00:14:48.595
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

241
00:14:49.495 --> 00:14:52.465
My mom gave me some side dishes to share with you.

242
00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:54.836
I made enough side dishes for him.

243
00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:56.735
But thanks, Soo Jin.

244
00:14:56.936 --> 00:14:58.605
You must be going through a lot.

245
00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:02.176
I saw it on the news about your case.

246
00:15:02.676 --> 00:15:03.816
I saw it too.

247
00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:05.475
By the way,

248
00:15:05.845 --> 00:15:07.985
I might be famous because of it. What do you think?

249
00:15:07.985 --> 00:15:09.885
It's not something to be happy about.

250
00:15:09.885 --> 00:15:12.215
Don't butt in others' business from now on.

251
00:15:12.215 --> 00:15:13.355
You aren't even good at fighting.

252
00:15:13.355 --> 00:15:15.385
I wasn't feeling well that day.

253
00:15:15.385 --> 00:15:16.385
Hit him some more.

254
00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:18.355
- Gosh, it hurts. - You need more beating.

255
00:15:19.696 --> 00:15:20.725
Pil, you're here.

256
00:15:22.495 --> 00:15:23.495
Hi.

257
00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:27.436
I didn't know you're here, Soo Jin.

258
00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:28.635
Hi.

259
00:15:29.105 --> 00:15:31.676
Did you find out anything about the culprit?

260
00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:33.306
Nothing yet.

261
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.276
I've talked to all the victims,

262
00:15:35.276 --> 00:15:37.316
and they said they didn't see his face.

263
00:15:37.316 --> 00:15:38.316
I have no clue.

264
00:15:38.316 --> 00:15:39.316
Hey,

265
00:15:40.115 --> 00:15:42.546
I have something to say to you about it.

266
00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:46.416
When I woke up,

267
00:15:46.416 --> 00:15:48.225
I remembered something.

268
00:15:48.456 --> 00:15:49.456
What is it?

269
00:15:49.725 --> 00:15:53.156
I think there was a scar on his wrist.

270
00:15:53.895 --> 00:15:55.566
- A scar? - Yes.

271
00:15:56.026 --> 00:15:57.865
It wasn't a small scar.

272
00:15:57.865 --> 00:16:00.365
It was pretty big.

273
00:16:01.635 --> 00:16:03.906
Jung Ae, can you get me a pen and a paper?

274
00:16:03.906 --> 00:16:04.906
Okay.

275
00:16:06.235 --> 00:16:07.276
Look.

276
00:16:08.005 --> 00:16:11.316
Like this. He had a long scar...

277
00:16:11.946 --> 00:16:13.345
on his wrist like this one.

278
00:16:16.656 --> 00:16:17.656
Right.

279
00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:19.656
Something like this one.

280
00:16:35.465 --> 00:16:37.406
Right, that's him.

281
00:16:38.276 --> 00:16:39.336
What do you mean?

282
00:16:39.605 --> 00:16:41.306
Well...

283
00:16:41.745 --> 00:16:45.745
I've seen a man with a scar like this before.

284
00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:47.916
- Who is that man? - Who is that punk?

285
00:16:48.046 --> 00:16:50.715
I caught him beating up a person then too.

286
00:16:50.715 --> 00:16:52.056
But I missed him in the end.

287
00:16:52.485 --> 00:16:53.956
I think it's the same person.

288
00:16:53.956 --> 00:16:56.556
You should've caught him then.

289
00:16:56.796 --> 00:16:58.956
Who on earth is doing this?

290
00:16:58.995 --> 00:17:01.166
I'm sure he's a lunatic.

291
00:17:01.926 --> 00:17:02.926
Dal Soo.

292
00:17:03.696 --> 00:17:05.635
I'll report this to the headquarters...

293
00:17:05.635 --> 00:17:07.605
so that they refer to it in their investigation.

294
00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:10.336
All right. Let's get him for certain.

295
00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:12.076
I want to see that punk's face.

296
00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:13.875
Please catch him for us.

297
00:17:18.816 --> 00:17:19.816
Soo Jin.

298
00:17:19.945 --> 00:17:21.615
You have a lot of stuff, I'll take you to home.

299
00:17:21.615 --> 00:17:22.645
It's fine.

300
00:17:22.645 --> 00:17:24.316
It seems heavy.

301
00:17:24.415 --> 00:17:26.056
No, I'm okay. It's not heavy.

302
00:17:26.986 --> 00:17:29.185
We're friends. You can accept this kind of favor.

303
00:17:29.185 --> 00:17:32.595
I won't be able to treat you like I did before...

304
00:17:32.655 --> 00:17:34.665
since you have hateful feelings toward Jae Hyun.

305
00:17:35.595 --> 00:17:36.935
We need some time.

306
00:17:37.365 --> 00:17:38.466
Bye.

307
00:17:39.336 --> 00:17:40.336
Soo Jin.

308
00:18:10.296 --> 00:18:11.566
Jae Hyun...

309
00:18:12.036 --> 00:18:14.806
You know how I become when I get mad.

310
00:18:16.006 --> 00:18:18.105
If you try to see her once again,

311
00:18:18.675 --> 00:18:21.506
I won't let it slide, so you better behave.

312
00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:41.095
If I can't have him,

313
00:18:46.236 --> 00:18:47.966
no one can have him.

314
00:19:04.556 --> 00:19:07.125
There's a scar on Jae Hyun's wrist too.

315
00:19:08.185 --> 00:19:09.955
I don't feel good about it.

316
00:19:10.955 --> 00:19:12.326
All right.

317
00:19:19.695 --> 00:19:20.766
Hello?

318
00:19:21.935 --> 00:19:23.536
It's me, Young Ju.

319
00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:26.036
Shall we have some tea together?

320
00:19:30.246 --> 00:19:31.316
Thank you.

321
00:19:33.786 --> 00:19:35.615
The weather is so nice.

322
00:19:35.945 --> 00:19:39.286
It would've been great to go take pictures with you.

323
00:19:39.286 --> 00:19:41.655
I know. Let's make sure to do that next time.

324
00:19:44.326 --> 00:19:47.066
I love your scarf by the way.

325
00:19:47.365 --> 00:19:49.165
Where did you get it?

326
00:19:51.635 --> 00:19:53.236
It's a gift from someone.

327
00:19:53.705 --> 00:19:54.736
Who?

328
00:19:55.135 --> 00:19:56.236
Your boyfriend?

329
00:19:56.365 --> 00:19:57.375
Yes.

330
00:19:58.036 --> 00:20:00.746
He has such good taste.

331
00:20:01.175 --> 00:20:02.375
You must be happy.

332
00:20:03.345 --> 00:20:04.516
In fact, I'm not.

333
00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:08.915
I was taken away that man by some woman.

334
00:20:09.786 --> 00:20:11.586
We dated for a long time,

335
00:20:12.955 --> 00:20:15.526
but he ended up marrying another woman.

336
00:20:17.496 --> 00:20:18.895
Goodness.

337
00:20:21.425 --> 00:20:23.435
It must be hard for you.

338
00:20:24.336 --> 00:20:25.395
It is.

339
00:20:26.836 --> 00:20:30.135
I love him very much even now.

340
00:20:35.246 --> 00:20:36.476
Cheer up.

341
00:20:36.776 --> 00:20:39.546
I'm sure you'll meet someone better than him.

342
00:20:41.516 --> 00:20:43.516
I don't need someone else.

343
00:20:44.816 --> 00:20:46.986
It has to be him.

344
00:20:51.556 --> 00:20:52.855
If there's...

345
00:20:53.226 --> 00:20:57.665
a woman who loves your husband more than you do,

346
00:20:58.095 --> 00:21:01.066
can you give up on him for her sake?

347
00:21:04.675 --> 00:21:05.806
My goodness.

348
00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:08.445
That's never going to happen.

349
00:21:09.205 --> 00:21:10.445
Why not?

350
00:21:12.175 --> 00:21:14.816
Jae Hyun was originally my man,

351
00:21:15.415 --> 00:21:17.586
so you must give him back to me!

352
00:21:19.216 --> 00:21:20.756
If it wasn't for you,

353
00:21:21.726 --> 00:21:23.355
I would've been...

354
00:21:24.056 --> 00:21:25.695
next to him now.

355
00:21:26.455 --> 00:21:28.865
You took away my place. Do you get it?

356
00:21:34.466 --> 00:21:35.466
Who...

357
00:21:36.435 --> 00:21:37.635
are you?

358
00:21:38.306 --> 00:21:39.306
Me?

359
00:21:41.605 --> 00:21:43.076
I am...

360
00:21:43.645 --> 00:21:45.516
Jae Hyun's lover.

361
00:21:47.486 --> 00:21:48.915
Let me give you a warning.

362
00:21:49.546 --> 00:21:52.056
You won't be able to live with him for a long time.

363
00:21:52.455 --> 00:21:54.955
Because I'm the only one...

364
00:21:56.355 --> 00:21:57.895
who can handle him.

365
00:22:02.095 --> 00:22:03.635
You're crazy.

366
00:22:06.665 --> 00:22:08.205
You're crazy.

367
00:22:09.905 --> 00:22:11.476
I have nothing more to say,

368
00:22:13.205 --> 00:22:14.945
so I'll go.

369
00:22:16.915 --> 00:22:18.046
Did you know...

370
00:22:19.316 --> 00:22:20.385
he was convicted for assault...

371
00:22:20.385 --> 00:22:22.445
and was hospitalized in a mental institute before?

372
00:22:31.526 --> 00:22:32.855
See?

373
00:22:34.066 --> 00:22:35.996
You can't handle him.

374
00:22:36.895 --> 00:22:38.635
I don't trust what you say.

375
00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:41.966
I don't trust you at all.

00:23:25.276 --> 00:23:26.586
Come to your senses.

379
00:23:27.816 --> 00:23:29.216
She's just a crazy woman.

380
00:23:32.086 --> 00:23:33.185
You shouldn't...

381
00:23:35.086 --> 00:23:36.355
trust what she said.

383
00:24:01.445 --> 00:24:03.256
Goodness, this is rather annoying.

384
00:24:16.195 --> 00:24:17.266
Is this a travel agency?

385
00:24:18.336 --> 00:24:20.105
I want to travel to the UK.

386
00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:22.105
Yes.

387
00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:30.476
Who's this?

388
00:24:30.776 --> 00:24:33.845
Oh, her? She's the one who found your phone.

389
00:24:33.845 --> 00:24:36.385
I met her again while I was taking some pictures.

390
00:24:37.516 --> 00:24:39.556
- Really? - Isn't she pretty?

391
00:24:43.326 --> 00:24:44.455
I'm sure it's not the case.

392
00:24:46.526 --> 00:24:47.695
It can't be.

393
00:24:53.435 --> 00:24:54.466
I'm home.

394
00:24:57.405 --> 00:24:58.576
Oh, hey.

395
00:24:58.935 --> 00:25:00.205
Is something going on?

396
00:25:00.976 --> 00:25:02.246
You don't look so well.

397
00:25:02.705 --> 00:25:05.145
Is it because your friend got hurt?

398
00:25:05.875 --> 00:25:06.885
No.

399
00:25:08.645 --> 00:25:11.355
Anyway, Jae Hyun.

400
00:25:15.756 --> 00:25:17.756
Do you remember the woman...

401
00:25:18.256 --> 00:25:21.665
who found your phone for you?

402
00:25:23.435 --> 00:25:25.266
Are you acquainted with her?

403
00:25:26.165 --> 00:25:27.865
Why do you ask?

404
00:25:29.365 --> 00:25:30.405
I...

405
00:25:31.336 --> 00:25:33.175
met Ms. Park Young Ju today.

406
00:25:35.445 --> 00:25:37.175
And she said...

407
00:25:38.445 --> 00:25:42.286
she dated you for a long time.

408
00:25:44.286 --> 00:25:45.486
Is that true?

409
00:25:45.955 --> 00:25:47.026
Yes.

410
00:25:57.466 --> 00:25:59.266
Then why did you ask me...

411
00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:02.665
like you didn't know her when I showed you?

412
00:26:02.966 --> 00:26:04.536
I didn't want...

413
00:26:05.506 --> 00:26:06.905
you to know about her.

414
00:26:10.046 --> 00:26:11.216
When I saw that picture,

415
00:26:11.915 --> 00:26:14.286
I figured she was trying to get to you.

416
00:26:15.185 --> 00:26:17.185
I went over to tell her to stop seeing you.

417
00:26:17.556 --> 00:26:18.556
But...

418
00:26:19.316 --> 00:26:21.026
I guess she didn't listen.

419
00:26:21.026 --> 00:26:22.155
I mean,

420
00:26:24.595 --> 00:26:26.455
you're a married man now.

421
00:26:27.296 --> 00:26:29.066
What's with her?

422
00:26:29.066 --> 00:26:30.895
If you met her, I'm sure you know by now...

423
00:26:31.496 --> 00:26:33.306
that she is mentally unstable.

424
00:26:33.705 --> 00:26:36.405
She's been stalking me and watching me...

425
00:26:37.076 --> 00:26:38.736
even after we broke up.

426
00:26:39.435 --> 00:26:42.246
She put me through a period of rough time.

427
00:26:43.076 --> 00:26:45.845
I thought about taking legal measures,

428
00:26:46.615 --> 00:26:49.786
but she was still someone I dated.

429
00:26:49.786 --> 00:26:51.316
So I couldn't go that far.

430
00:26:53.885 --> 00:26:54.986
Jae Hyun.

431
00:26:56.695 --> 00:27:00.425
You should've told me about this before.

432
00:27:01.365 --> 00:27:03.566
Do you know how shocked I was today?

433
00:27:06.736 --> 00:27:08.935
I'm sorry, Soo Jin.

434
00:27:09.905 --> 00:27:11.036
It's all my fault.

435
00:27:14.046 --> 00:27:16.816
You said she's mentally unstable.

436
00:27:18.546 --> 00:27:20.786
I'm sure you couldn't do anything about her.

437
00:27:26.726 --> 00:27:28.385
You must have been very surprised.

438
00:27:29.726 --> 00:27:33.296
I'll do something to make sure...

439
00:27:33.665 --> 00:27:34.895
she doesn't come near you.

440
00:27:35.966 --> 00:27:37.365
Okay.

441
00:27:39.296 --> 00:27:40.905
You should be careful too.

442
00:27:42.236 --> 00:27:43.306
Okay.

443
00:27:49.915 --> 00:27:51.175
Hello.

444
00:27:51.816 --> 00:27:53.016
Hello.

445
00:27:53.185 --> 00:27:56.115
Seok Tae, do you remember that park...

446
00:27:56.115 --> 00:27:58.786
with that manhole we closed up.

447
00:27:58.786 --> 00:27:59.955
Yes, why?

448
00:27:59.955 --> 00:28:01.385
What's happening with the maintenance?

449
00:28:01.385 --> 00:28:04.326
Someone reported that the cement is shattered.

450
00:28:04.326 --> 00:28:05.496
What?

451
00:28:10.296 --> 00:28:14.165
Goodness, Pil. He must be insane.

452
00:28:14.665 --> 00:28:16.105
What did he use?

453
00:28:17.336 --> 00:28:18.905
My gosh, where did he get this?

454
00:28:21.145 --> 00:28:23.816
Where is he right now? I'll get him.

455
00:28:24.216 --> 00:28:25.516
I'll kill him.

456
00:28:26.375 --> 00:28:27.786
A scar on his wrist?

457
00:28:28.046 --> 00:28:30.615
The victim said he had a long scar on his wrist.

458
00:28:30.615 --> 00:28:31.786
It was shaped like this.

459
00:28:33.115 --> 00:28:35.355
Don't you think this can be used as a lead?

460
00:28:35.355 --> 00:28:38.425
How can we find this guy with a scar?

461
00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:40.425
We can't go around searching for scars.

462
00:28:40.425 --> 00:28:42.796
We need some suspects to check their scars.

463
00:28:42.796 --> 00:28:45.266
It's better than nothing.

464
00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:47.736
We might find someone if we single out...

465
00:28:47.736 --> 00:28:49.605
an ex-convict with a scar on their wrist.

466
00:28:49.605 --> 00:28:51.336
Hand it over to the detective in charge.

467
00:28:51.336 --> 00:28:52.605
Yes, sir.

468
00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:55.175
How's your friend doing?

469
00:28:55.645 --> 00:28:58.016
Oh, he's still in the hospital.

470
00:28:58.016 --> 00:29:00.615
But he's recovering faster than I thought.

471
00:29:01.615 --> 00:29:03.185
That's a relief.

472
00:29:03.185 --> 00:29:06.286
I'm sure you're bummed out because of your friend,

473
00:29:06.286 --> 00:29:08.425
but hand over the case to the detective in charge,

474
00:29:08.425 --> 00:29:10.155
and keep it up in this patrol division.

475
00:29:10.155 --> 00:29:11.195
Yes, sir.

476
00:29:12.355 --> 00:29:13.625
Hey, Pil.

477
00:29:14.395 --> 00:29:16.026
Did you do that to the manhole at the park?

478
00:29:16.026 --> 00:29:17.236
What's with him?

479
00:29:17.236 --> 00:29:18.665
No, don't worry.

480
00:29:18.665 --> 00:29:20.865
I'll take care of this one.

481
00:29:20.865 --> 00:29:22.336
Hey, let's talk outside.

482
00:29:22.336 --> 00:29:24.605
- Yes, but... - Move, move.

483
00:29:24.605 --> 00:29:26.105
Come out.

484
00:29:26.605 --> 00:29:28.476
We need to talk.

485
00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:31.415
Are you crazy?

486
00:29:31.415 --> 00:29:32.546
Why did you do that?

487
00:29:32.546 --> 00:29:34.786
Were you trying to time travel again?

488
00:29:34.786 --> 00:29:37.486
Think about how desperate I was.

489
00:29:37.655 --> 00:29:39.415
You wouldn't do anything for me,

490
00:29:39.415 --> 00:29:40.586
so I had to do that myself.

491
00:29:40.586 --> 00:29:43.425
Are you into some kind of a new age religion?

492
00:29:43.425 --> 00:29:45.056
Is it called the Holy Manhole?

493
00:29:45.155 --> 00:29:47.566
You've been kind of crazy recently.

494
00:29:47.566 --> 00:29:49.865
I understand that you cannot believe me.

495
00:29:50.266 --> 00:29:52.736
But think about how I felt when I asked you for that.

496
00:29:52.736 --> 00:29:54.236
I knew I would come off as crazy.

497
00:29:54.236 --> 00:29:56.266
Do you understand how desperate I am?

498
00:29:56.935 --> 00:30:00.276
Fine, let's say what you said is true.

499
00:30:00.276 --> 00:30:02.905
Why are you trying to travel through time?

500
00:30:09.615 --> 00:30:11.016
Because I'm not happy.

501
00:30:12.486 --> 00:30:14.655
This isn't the reality which I chose.

502
00:30:15.056 --> 00:30:16.355
No matter how much I try,

503
00:30:16.355 --> 00:30:18.496
I can't change anything in this reality.

504
00:30:25.165 --> 00:30:26.195
Hey.

505
00:30:26.905 --> 00:30:30.236
If you sound this serious all of a sudden,

506
00:30:31.076 --> 00:30:32.806
did you think I would believe you?

507
00:30:32.976 --> 00:30:34.306
I'm warning you.

508
00:30:34.306 --> 00:30:35.845
If you do this again,

509
00:30:35.845 --> 00:30:37.845
I'll get you fired. Okay?

510
00:30:38.615 --> 00:30:39.776
Get ahold of yourself.

Goodness, I need to iron this shirt.

512
00:31:01.536 --> 00:31:02.736
The pants are...

513
00:31:03.105 --> 00:31:04.105
What?

514
00:31:06.506 --> 00:31:07.605
What's this?

515
00:31:19.415 --> 00:31:20.556
Jae Hyun.

516
00:31:20.955 --> 00:31:23.955
I found this inside your pocket.

517
00:31:23.955 --> 00:31:26.056
Why did you get tickets to go to the UK?

518
00:31:26.056 --> 00:31:29.226
It was a surprise, but you got me.

519
00:31:30.895 --> 00:31:33.036
It's our anniversary soon.

520
00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:35.705
You said you wanted to take pictures there,

521
00:31:35.705 --> 00:31:37.336
so I prepared those as a present.

522
00:31:39.976 --> 00:31:41.006
Jae Hyun.

523
00:31:41.006 --> 00:31:42.875
We'll close the pharmacy for a week...

524
00:31:42.875 --> 00:31:44.175
and travel there.

525
00:31:45.216 --> 00:31:46.615
Okay, then.

526
00:31:47.086 --> 00:31:48.845
Just thinking about that makes me feel excited.

527
00:31:49.746 --> 00:31:52.286
Oh, right. What happened to Goo Gil?

528
00:31:52.615 --> 00:31:54.326
He'll be discharged today.

529
00:31:55.155 --> 00:31:57.595
Did they find any lead on who did that to him?

530
00:31:57.595 --> 00:31:59.095
I don't think so.

531
00:31:59.425 --> 00:32:00.625
I mean, it was a random assault.

532
00:32:00.625 --> 00:32:02.026
He's not going to be caught easily.

533
00:32:02.026 --> 00:32:03.236
I guess you're right.

534
00:32:04.095 --> 00:32:05.296
Right.

535
00:32:05.296 --> 00:32:08.266
We have to do a homework before we go.

536

537

it's Mother's birthday while we're in the UK.

Let's meet up with her and get her a present.

539
00:32:17.945 --> 00:32:20.685
No way. You don't need to get her a present.

540
00:32:20.685 --> 00:32:23.016
I just need to give her enough cash.

541
00:32:23.016 --> 00:32:26.155
Cash? There's not much thought into that.

542

Look at you.

546
00:32:45.276 --> 00:32:47.205
You should've stayed there longer.

547

It's not like I'm dying.

548
00:32:50.216 --> 00:32:51.776
I needed to reopen this place too.

549
00:32:51.776 --> 00:32:54.385
You're overly diligent.

550

Yes, no. We can deliver.

Pardon?

557
00:33:14.736 --> 00:33:17.576
The same as before? So, 40 cups?

558

Yes, sure. Of course.

You should go and open your business.

You'll lose all of your customers.

I'm really fine. You should go.

567

Okay.

568

I'll be right back after the delivery.

569

So stay here and get some rest, okay?

- You mean Goo Gil? - Yes.

582
00:34:21.736 --> 00:34:24.935
It looks like he had an accident.

00:39:21.736 --> 00:39:22.906
Don't say that.

682
00:39:27.906 --> 00:39:28.906
Well...

683
00:39:29.346 --> 00:39:32.316
I need to go back to the pharmacy now.

684
00:39:32.316 --> 00:39:33.386
All right.

685
00:39:34.046 --> 00:39:35.415
Take your time.

686
00:39:36.185 --> 00:39:38.015
Okay. See you at home.

687
00:39:38.415 --> 00:39:39.955
- Bye, Jae Hyun. - Bye.

688
00:39:46.296 --> 00:39:47.526
- Eat up. - Okay.

689
00:39:50.736 --> 00:39:53.406
Hey, Jae Hyun left his cell phone.

690
00:39:53.406 --> 00:39:54.406
What do we do?

691
00:39:54.665 --> 00:39:55.665
Goodness.

692
00:39:57.836 --> 00:39:58.836
Well,

693
00:39:58.906 --> 00:40:01.575
I'll stop by the pharmacy on the way home.

694
00:40:01.575 --> 00:40:03.006
- Okay. - All right.

695
00:40:03.006 --> 00:40:04.075
Eat up.

696
00:40:06.586 --> 00:40:10.285
(Pharmacy)

697
00:40:10.285 --> 00:40:11.515
What brings you here?

698
00:40:14.185 --> 00:40:16.926
I'm distributing the wanted posters.

699
00:40:17.926 --> 00:40:20.196
I see. I hope you catch him soon.

700
00:40:20.265 --> 00:40:21.366
This is really serious.

701
00:40:21.366 --> 00:40:23.296
Give it to me. I'll put it up.

702
00:40:36.875 --> 00:40:38.975
I think a piece of it broke off.

703
00:40:40.645 --> 00:40:41.986
Is this key chain yours?

704
00:40:42.185 --> 00:40:43.455
Yes, why do you ask?

705
00:40:44.216 --> 00:40:45.216
It's broken.

706
00:40:46.415 --> 00:40:48.386
We found something similar...

707
00:40:48.725 --> 00:40:51.526
to this key at the crime scene near the tunnel.

708
00:40:55.265 --> 00:40:57.796
I pass by the tunnel every day,

709
00:40:57.796 --> 00:40:59.236
so I could've dropped it there.

710
00:41:00.105 --> 00:41:01.906
This was broken a long time ago.

711
00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:10.176
I think the attacker had a scar on his wrist.

712
00:41:13.316 --> 00:41:14.316
Excuse me.

713
00:41:15.986 --> 00:41:17.355
May I see your wrist?

714
00:41:17.756 --> 00:41:19.015
Why?

715
00:41:19.015 --> 00:41:20.586
I need to check something.

716
00:41:22.785 --> 00:41:25.055
Are you suspecting me as the attacker?

717
00:41:25.895 --> 00:41:29.165
The situation makes you seem suspicious.

718
00:41:31.495 --> 00:41:34.406
I know you don't like me because of Soo Jin.

719
00:41:35.035 --> 00:41:37.636
You shouldn't suspect a man for personal reasons.

720
00:41:40.105 --> 00:41:42.346
You wish that I was the assailant, right?

721
00:41:42.776 --> 00:41:44.975
Because then you can have Soo Jin.

722
00:41:46.046 --> 00:41:47.046
What?

723
00:41:49.415 --> 00:41:51.256
If you think I'm the culprit,

724
00:41:51.955 --> 00:41:53.185
catch me.

725
00:41:54.486 --> 00:41:56.656
What did you just say?

726
00:41:56.656 --> 00:41:59.055
Catch me if you can.

727
00:42:04.136 --> 00:42:05.136
Hey.

728
00:42:05.836 --> 00:42:06.836
You...

729
00:42:07.705 --> 00:42:09.305
You did it, didn't you?

730
00:42:16.475 --> 00:42:19.245
You jerk. Tell the truth.

731
00:42:19.276 --> 00:42:22.086
You did it, didn't you? You attacked Goo Gil!

732
00:42:28.526 --> 00:42:30.055
Why did you do it?

733
00:42:30.055 --> 00:42:31.696
Why did you do it, jerk?

734
00:42:32.855 --> 00:42:33.966
Answer me!

735
00:42:36.125 --> 00:42:37.765
Why did you do it, jerk?

736
00:42:45.006 --> 00:42:47.475
- Goodness. - Police?

737
00:42:47.475 --> 00:42:49.305
- I'm at a pharmacy. - Goodness.

738
00:42:49.305 --> 00:42:52.446
A policeman is hitting a pharmacist.

739
00:42:52.875 --> 00:42:55.316
- Please hurry up. - Goodness.

740
00:42:55.515 --> 00:42:57.486
- My gosh. - Call the police.

741
00:43:02.886 --> 00:43:05.156
Hey! What are you doing?

742
00:43:05.156 --> 00:43:06.156
Stop it.

743
00:43:07.265 --> 00:43:08.426
Jae Hyun, are you okay?

744
00:43:09.625 --> 00:43:10.696
Goodness.

745
00:43:11.596 --> 00:43:14.636
Pil. Why did you hit Jae Hyun?

746
00:43:14.805 --> 00:43:16.435
What's the reason?

747
00:43:17.435 --> 00:43:18.535
I think...

748
00:43:19.176 --> 00:43:22.075
Pil is suspecting me.

749
00:43:23.415 --> 00:43:24.975
The piece of a key chain he found...

750
00:43:25.346 --> 00:43:28.645
at the crime scene matches my key chain.

751
00:43:29.546 --> 00:43:31.785
It seems like he thinks I'm the assailant.

752
00:43:32.515 --> 00:43:33.526
What?

753
00:43:34.656 --> 00:43:35.656
Hey.

754
00:43:36.026 --> 00:43:37.325
Are you crazy?

755
00:43:37.325 --> 00:43:38.526
Are you out of your mind?

756
00:43:38.526 --> 00:43:40.926
How can you conclude that he's the culprit?

757
00:43:40.926 --> 00:43:41.995
How can you call yourself a police officer?

758
00:43:42.125 --> 00:43:43.236
Soo Jin.

759
00:43:43.636 --> 00:43:45.366
You must not trust this guy.

760
00:43:45.366 --> 00:43:47.136
He's dangerous.

761
00:43:47.665 --> 00:43:48.705
Pil.

762
00:43:49.466 --> 00:43:51.875
I don't think I can see you anymore.

763
00:43:52.676 --> 00:43:53.906
No, I won't see you anymore.

764
00:43:54.946 --> 00:43:57.176
Starting from today, you and I are strangers.

765
00:43:57.875 --> 00:44:00.015
You're not my friend anymore.

766
00:44:01.386 --> 00:44:02.446
Get out.

767
00:44:03.185 --> 00:44:04.316
Get out of here!

768
00:44:17.395 --> 00:44:18.796
Are you okay, Jae Hyun?

769
00:44:19.096 --> 00:44:20.265
- Oh, no. - Pil.

770
00:44:23.935 --> 00:44:25.406
There has been a report...

771
00:44:25.406 --> 00:44:27.975
that a police officer was fighting with a civilian.

772
00:44:28.846 --> 00:44:30.216
Was that you?

773
00:44:30.676 --> 00:44:31.716
Yes.

774
00:44:32.515 --> 00:44:34.346
Are you out of your mind?

775
00:44:34.346 --> 00:44:35.946
You can't do that!

776
00:44:40.026 --> 00:44:41.185
Why did you do it?

777
00:44:41.855 --> 00:44:43.725
What on earth is the reason...

778
00:44:43.725 --> 00:44:45.196
that a police officer would hit a civilian?

779
00:44:45.196 --> 00:44:46.325
Mr. Choi.

780
00:44:47.125 --> 00:44:49.765
He's the culprit of the assault case.

781
00:44:50.866 --> 00:44:53.096
- What? - The ornament...

782
00:44:53.096 --> 00:44:55.165
we found at the scene is a part of his key ring.

783
00:44:55.236 --> 00:44:56.466
Pil.

784
00:44:57.075 --> 00:44:59.535
You're not a prosecutor or a detective.

785
00:44:59.535 --> 00:45:01.875
Let's say he's the culprit like you claim.

786
00:45:01.875 --> 00:45:04.145
Can you beat the culprit up like that?

787
00:45:04.676 --> 00:45:07.185
If he takes it to court,

788
00:45:07.185 --> 00:45:09.316
it'll be considered seriously. Do you get it?

789
00:45:09.316 --> 00:45:11.515
Do you want to resign?

790
00:45:13.586 --> 00:45:16.285
After you leave work today, go beg him...

791
00:45:16.285 --> 00:45:18.455
for forgiveness, okay?

792
00:45:18.455 --> 00:45:20.196
I will never do that.

793
00:45:20.466 --> 00:45:21.526
Hey.

794
00:45:22.325 --> 00:45:23.995
Hey, Pil!

795
00:45:30.636 --> 00:45:32.236
It must hurt a lot.

796
00:45:33.006 --> 00:45:34.105
Does it hurt?

797
00:45:35.245 --> 00:45:36.816
I'm sorry, Jae Hyun.

798
00:45:38.116 --> 00:45:40.446
I didn't know...

799
00:45:40.446 --> 00:45:43.116
Pil hated you that much.

800
00:45:43.116 --> 00:45:44.555
You don't need to be sorry.

801
00:45:47.685 --> 00:45:49.026
Jae Hyun.

802
00:45:50.055 --> 00:45:51.296
By any chance,

803
00:45:52.055 --> 00:45:53.725
are you going to report him?

804
00:45:55.866 --> 00:45:59.366
I mean, it's true that he's at fault,

805
00:46:00.205 --> 00:46:03.975
but I think it's too harsh to make him get punished.

806
00:46:03.975 --> 00:46:06.946
How can you say that when I got beaten up by him?

807
00:46:10.575 --> 00:46:14.785
He became a police officer only recently.

808
00:46:14.986 --> 00:46:18.555
He might get fired if he gets in trouble for this.

809
00:46:19.355 --> 00:46:22.325
He studied so hard to become a police officer.

810
00:46:22.555 --> 00:46:23.895
It'll be too bad for him.

811
00:46:25.656 --> 00:46:26.725
Jae Hyun.

812
00:46:27.325 --> 00:46:29.296
Let's forgive him just once.

813
00:46:30.196 --> 00:46:31.736
Instead, I'll make sure...

814
00:46:31.966 --> 00:46:35.165
you won't get emotionally hurt because of him.

815
00:46:35.165 --> 00:46:36.236
Please.

816
00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:39.035
Jae Hyun?

817
00:46:40.946 --> 00:46:44.116
Okay. I'll go get washed up.

818
00:46:44.375 --> 00:46:45.446
Okay.

819
00:47:03.535 --> 00:47:04.736
Why did he...

820
00:47:05.495 --> 00:47:08.066
want to see my wrist?

821
00:47:28.285 --> 00:47:31.855
Why are things going so complicated?

Soo Jin.

825
00:48:00.256 --> 00:48:02.185
I try not to suspect him,

826
00:48:02.185 --> 00:48:04.796
but why do I keep feeling like he's a bad guy?

827
00:48:09.026 --> 00:48:10.796
I don't know about anything else,

828
00:48:12.966 --> 00:48:14.736
but I'm worried about you so much.

829
00:48:15.966 --> 00:48:18.136
I'm worried about you that it's driving me crazy.

830
00:48:33.685 --> 00:48:35.986
What brings you here, Mom?

831
00:48:35.986 --> 00:48:37.455
I bought a box of fruits,

832
00:48:37.455 --> 00:48:38.855
and there were too many so I brought you some.

833
00:48:38.855 --> 00:48:40.796
They'll only go bad if I keep them at home.

834
00:48:40.926 --> 00:48:42.966
- Oranges! - They're fresh.

835
00:48:43.596 --> 00:48:44.636
Hello.

836
00:48:44.636 --> 00:48:47.066
You didn't go for work yet.

837
00:48:47.066 --> 00:48:48.236
I'm about to.

838
00:48:48.236 --> 00:48:49.535
- Okay. - Enjoy your time.

839
00:48:49.535 --> 00:48:50.676
Okay, bye.

840
00:48:53.276 --> 00:48:54.975
Goodness, Soo Jin.

841
00:48:55.745 --> 00:48:57.475
What happened to his face?

Well... It's nothing.

843
00:49:00.216 --> 00:49:01.586
It's something.

844
00:49:02.346 --> 00:49:05.756
Is he the victim of the assault case?

845
00:49:05.756 --> 00:49:07.886
No, that's not it.

846
00:49:07.886 --> 00:49:10.596
Explain so I can understand!

847

848

00:49:20.665 --> 00:49:21.765
Look.

852
00:49:22.105 --> 00:49:23.535
Where's Pil?

853
00:49:23.676 --> 00:49:24.836
Why do you ask?

854
00:49:24.836 --> 00:49:26.375
I'm speechless.

855
00:49:26.375 --> 00:49:28.776
Can a police officer beat up a person?

856
00:49:28.776 --> 00:49:30.975
Pil beat up my son-in-law...

857
00:49:30.975 --> 00:49:33.185
that his face became a mess.

858
00:49:33.185 --> 00:49:34.486
What?

859
00:49:34.486 --> 00:49:36.685
I need to talk to Pil right now.

860
00:49:36.685 --> 00:49:38.086
Goodness.

861
00:49:38.086 --> 00:49:40.055
Pil, come out already!

862
00:49:40.055 --> 00:49:43.296
You must be mistaken. Calm down first.

863
00:49:43.296 --> 00:49:44.796
We're not mistaken.

864
00:49:44.796 --> 00:49:46.926
You all know that Pil isn't fond of...

865
00:49:46.926 --> 00:49:48.596
my son-in-law.

866
00:49:48.625 --> 00:49:51.236
What bad feelings does he have against Soo Jin...

867
00:49:51.236 --> 00:49:52.765
that he spent his entire life tormenting her?

868
00:49:52.765 --> 00:49:55.165
How long is he going to act like this?

869
00:50:09.616 --> 00:50:11.515
Pil, wake up.

870
00:50:17.895 --> 00:50:20.426
I heard you hit Jae Hyun.

871
00:50:20.426 --> 00:50:22.796
Why did you hit him? Tell us why you did that.

872
00:50:23.935 --> 00:50:25.836
Tell us already, you brat.

873
00:50:26.605 --> 00:50:27.935
I have nothing to say.

874
00:50:27.935 --> 00:50:30.575
Right, no words can justify your action.

875
00:50:30.575 --> 00:50:32.475
You took it out on him...

876
00:50:32.475 --> 00:50:35.305
because you're still not over Soo Jin, right?

877
00:50:35.305 --> 00:50:37.015
Is it really because of her?

878
00:50:37.776 --> 00:50:39.216
I'm sorry,

879
00:50:40.415 --> 00:50:42.586
but I don't want to say anything now.

880
00:50:42.616 --> 00:50:45.756
Please leave me alone.

881
00:50:45.756 --> 00:50:48.455
He's making my life so miserable.

882
00:50:48.455 --> 00:50:49.995
Why do you live like this?

883
00:50:49.995 --> 00:50:51.526
What are you going to do?

884
00:50:51.526 --> 00:50:53.966
Let's go out for now.

885
00:50:53.966 --> 00:50:55.366
Goodness.

886
00:50:55.366 --> 00:50:56.426
Let's go out.

887
00:51:05.975 --> 00:51:07.975
What? Pil hit Jae Hyun?

888
00:51:07.975 --> 00:51:11.645
Yes, so Soo Jin won't see him anymore.

889
00:51:11.645 --> 00:51:13.075
Why did he do that?

890
00:51:13.075 --> 00:51:14.616
What did he do so wrong?

891
00:51:14.616 --> 00:51:17.816
Pil drove him as the assailant.

892
00:51:18.216 --> 00:51:19.486
What?

893
00:51:19.685 --> 00:51:21.586
On what grounds?

894
00:51:21.586 --> 00:51:24.325
There's an ornament attached to his key ring.

895
00:51:24.325 --> 00:51:27.466
The broken part was found in the assault site.

896
00:51:27.466 --> 00:51:29.325
Still, he can't suspect Jae Hyun.

897
00:51:29.325 --> 00:51:30.836
He went too far.

898
00:51:30.836 --> 00:51:33.866
He didn't like Jae Hyun in the first place.

899
00:51:33.866 --> 00:51:35.665
He must've wanted to frame him.

900
00:51:35.665 --> 00:51:37.305
He's not in his right mind these days.

901
00:51:37.305 --> 00:51:40.406
He said that he time travels through a manhole.

902
00:51:40.406 --> 00:51:42.645
What nonsense is that?

903
00:51:42.645 --> 00:51:44.446
Time traveling?

904
00:51:44.446 --> 00:51:46.685
Wait a second. Hey, Pil.

905
00:51:46.685 --> 00:51:48.846
Where are you going? Come over here.

906
00:51:49.185 --> 00:51:50.915
Do you call yourself a human?

907
00:51:50.915 --> 00:51:53.055
How could you suspect Jae Hyun and hit him?

908
00:51:53.055 --> 00:51:54.926
Right, how did you manage to become...

909
00:51:54.926 --> 00:51:56.455
a police officer with those poor eyes of yours?

910
00:51:56.455 --> 00:51:58.225
He seemed to be a good guy.

911
00:51:58.256 --> 00:51:59.696
That's right.

912
00:51:59.796 --> 00:52:01.696
You went too far this time.

913
00:52:02.196 --> 00:52:04.535
Have you gone blind out of jealousy?

914
00:52:04.535 --> 00:52:07.105
You shouldn't have done that in any case.

915
00:52:07.105 --> 00:52:08.866
It's not that.

916
00:52:09.165 --> 00:52:10.736
Stop being nosy when you know nothing.

917
00:52:10.736 --> 00:52:12.105
Everyone else knows except for you...

918
00:52:12.105 --> 00:52:13.276
that he is a good guy.

919
00:52:13.276 --> 00:52:16.915
Soo Jin asked him not to report you...

920
00:52:16.915 --> 00:52:18.446
and he said okay.

921
00:52:18.446 --> 00:52:19.986
I would report you right away if I were him.

922
00:52:19.986 --> 00:52:22.486
Right. Be thankful...

923
00:52:22.486 --> 00:52:24.455
and repent, okay?

924
00:52:25.756 --> 00:52:26.955
- What? - Hey.

925
00:52:26.955 --> 00:52:27.986
Where is he going?

926
00:52:27.986 --> 00:52:30.796
He's all mad when he's the one who's at fault.

927
00:52:32.026 --> 00:52:35.566
I'm sorry for what my subordinate did to you.

928
00:52:35.566 --> 00:52:38.296
I apologize on his behalf.

929
00:52:39.336 --> 00:52:41.506
It's okay. I understand.

930
00:52:42.205 --> 00:52:44.136
He'll get punished...

931
00:52:44.136 --> 00:52:46.406
for what he's done,

932
00:52:48.305 --> 00:52:50.716
but could you forgive him and not report him?

933
00:52:50.776 --> 00:52:52.745
He's a young fellow with bright future,

934
00:52:52.745 --> 00:52:54.886
and one mistake shouldn't stop him.

935
00:52:54.986 --> 00:52:56.855
Sure, I'll let it go.

936
00:52:56.855 --> 00:52:58.285
He's not a stranger after all.

937
00:53:00.555 --> 00:53:02.256
You're so handsome...

938
00:53:02.825 --> 00:53:05.895
and broadminded as well. Thank you so much.

939
00:53:05.895 --> 00:53:07.526
I'll leave you then. Goodbye.

940
00:53:07.526 --> 00:53:08.725
Bye.

941
00:53:08.725 --> 00:53:09.966
Oh, right.

942
00:53:10.836 --> 00:53:12.696
Take these and share with your colleagues.

943
00:53:12.696 --> 00:53:15.366
Gosh, you shouldn't...

944
00:53:15.366 --> 00:53:17.236
Then I'll take just one.

945
00:53:17.236 --> 00:53:19.475
Thank you so much.

946
00:53:28.986 --> 00:53:31.386
So why did he act up?

947
00:53:43.966 --> 00:53:45.736
I just met with Mr. Park Jae Hyun.

948
00:53:47.466 --> 00:53:49.506
Thankfully, he wanted to show you mercy.

949
00:53:49.506 --> 00:53:51.435
It won't come down to the worst situation.

950
00:53:53.975 --> 00:53:56.346
You should be thankful that he's a good man.

951
00:53:57.046 --> 00:53:58.075
But still,

952
00:53:58.375 --> 00:54:01.685
you can't be forgiven for beating a civilian.

953
00:54:01.886 --> 00:54:03.986
You will be suspended for a month.

954
00:54:04.455 --> 00:54:05.455
Keep that in mind.

955
00:54:34.446 --> 00:54:35.515
No.

956
00:54:37.555 --> 00:54:38.855
People can be like that...

957
00:54:39.586 --> 00:54:40.926
when they get angry.

958
00:54:42.685 --> 00:54:43.756
It's nothing.

959
00:54:53.805 --> 00:54:55.336
Hey, wait.

960
00:54:58.935 --> 00:55:01.406
You can go ahead. I'll be right behind you.

961
00:55:01.406 --> 00:55:02.406
Sure.

962
00:55:08.216 --> 00:55:09.216
Soo Jin.

963
00:55:13.656 --> 00:55:15.225
- We need to talk. - Let go.

964
00:55:15.486 --> 00:55:16.995
I told you not to say hello to me.

965
00:55:17.495 --> 00:55:19.596
I heard you told Jae Hyun not to report me.

966
00:55:20.366 --> 00:55:21.625
Don't be delusional.

967
00:55:21.625 --> 00:55:23.125
I didn't do this for you.

968
00:55:23.265 --> 00:55:24.336
Why did you do that?

969
00:55:24.765 --> 00:55:26.366
You should've let him report me.

970
00:55:27.466 --> 00:55:30.276
I'm sure you resent and hate me for doing that.

971
00:55:30.276 --> 00:55:33.406
I thought of your parents who were so glad that...

972
00:55:33.406 --> 00:55:34.875
you finally got a job. That's why.

973
00:55:35.105 --> 00:55:36.546
If it wasn't for them,

974
00:55:36.546 --> 00:55:38.075
I would've reported you myself.

975
00:55:39.616 --> 00:55:41.015
As I told you yesterday,

976
00:55:41.015 --> 00:55:43.145
I don't think of you as a friend anymore.

977
00:55:43.386 --> 00:55:45.816
This is the last favor I do for you.

978
00:56:18.316 --> 00:56:20.625
No one will believe me.

979
00:56:22.526 --> 00:56:24.995
Soo Jin is beginning to hate me more and more.

980
00:56:31.165 --> 00:56:33.636
Each day just gets worse and worse.

981
00:56:44.245 --> 00:56:45.245
Hey.

982
00:56:46.276 --> 00:56:49.745
How can you take me away from this awful place?

983
00:56:52.685 --> 00:56:53.926
What can I do?

984
00:57:02.296 --> 00:57:04.895
What are you doing here?

985
00:57:11.975 --> 00:57:14.075
Hey, are you just getting off work?

986
00:57:14.946 --> 00:57:17.216
Are you trying to break into the manhole again?

987
00:57:18.145 --> 00:57:19.245
Don't worry.

988
00:57:19.816 --> 00:57:21.716
I don't have the energy to do that.

989
00:57:22.515 --> 00:57:23.555
Goodness.

990
00:57:24.616 --> 00:57:25.616
Hey.

991
00:57:25.785 --> 00:57:29.026
Stop causing trouble in Soo Jin's family...

992
00:57:29.026 --> 00:57:30.825
who's happily married.

993
00:57:31.125 --> 00:57:33.765
You need to get ahold of yourself.

994
00:57:33.796 --> 00:57:34.825
Sure.

995
00:57:35.596 --> 00:57:37.366
Everyone thinks I'm the bad guy.

996
00:57:38.895 --> 00:57:39.935
Would I...

997
00:57:41.265 --> 00:57:43.435
Would I do that to an innocent man?

998
00:57:43.435 --> 00:57:44.836
I don't care. Whatever.

999
00:57:44.836 --> 00:57:47.245
Anyway, anyone can see that you were wrong.

1000
00:57:47.245 --> 00:57:50.875
So you need to apologize to Jae Hyun...

1001
00:57:51.046 --> 00:57:52.575
and to Soo Jin.

1002
00:57:56.316 --> 00:57:58.855
I understand you still have feelings for her,

1003
00:57:59.515 --> 00:58:02.756
but if you like her, you can't do this to her.

1004
00:58:07.566 --> 00:58:09.466
You need to stop this for the sake...

1005
00:58:10.796 --> 00:58:12.096
of Soo Jin's happiness.

1006
00:58:41.165 --> 00:58:42.165
Welcome.

1007
00:58:44.366 --> 00:58:46.736
Wow, you don't look very well.

1008
00:58:46.966 --> 00:58:47.966
I guess so.

1009
00:58:48.906 --> 00:58:50.475
How are you feeling?

1010
00:58:51.136 --> 00:58:53.075
It seems like your wounds are healing.

1011
00:58:53.305 --> 00:58:57.015
I can really take a beating, you know.

1012
00:58:58.316 --> 00:59:00.216
I need an ointment to get rid of scars.

1013
00:59:00.216 --> 00:59:01.216
Sure.

1014
00:59:04.386 --> 00:59:07.125
You must be angry because of Pil.

1015
00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:11.125
He's been a bit odd since when he was a kid.

1016
00:59:12.596 --> 00:59:14.895
I thank you so much...

1017
00:59:15.125 --> 00:59:16.665
for showing him mercy.

1018
00:59:16.665 --> 00:59:17.696
It's nothing.

1019
00:59:17.696 --> 00:59:19.265
He's Soo Jin's friend too.

1020
00:59:19.906 --> 00:59:20.906
Here you are.

1021
00:59:30.745 --> 00:59:31.745
What is it?

1022
00:59:32.075 --> 00:59:33.346
Oh, it's nothing.

1023
00:59:35.515 --> 00:59:37.616
- How much is this? - Five dollars.

1024
00:59:37.616 --> 00:59:40.355
Five dollars. Here you are.

1025
00:59:42.256 --> 00:59:43.395
See you later.

1026
00:59:43.656 --> 00:59:44.756
Goodbye.

1027
00:59:51.866 --> 00:59:54.805
That looks like the scar which I saw on that day.

1028
01:00:00.645 --> 01:00:02.705
No, I doubt it.

1029
01:00:05.216 --> 01:00:06.276
It can't be him.

1030
01:00:07.716 --> 01:00:08.785
It can't be.

1031
01:00:09.185 --> 01:00:10.486
Gosh, my back.

1032
01:00:11.355 --> 01:00:13.055
Should I pack more long sleeves?

1033
01:00:16.895 --> 01:00:17.955
You're home.

1034
01:00:18.026 --> 01:00:19.300
You're right on time.

1035
01:00:19.325 --> 01:00:20.696
Where's your suitcase?

1036
01:00:20.696 --> 01:00:23.196
I'm packing up, but I don't see your suitcase.

1037
01:00:23.196 --> 01:00:25.596
It's in my trunk.

1038
01:00:25.665 --> 01:00:26.736
I'll bring it.

1039
01:00:26.906 --> 01:00:28.636
No. I'll go.

1040
01:00:28.636 --> 01:00:30.836
You should go and wash up. Key, please.

1041
01:00:31.906 --> 01:00:33.245
- Thank you. - Sure.

1042
01:01:01.535 --> 01:01:02.535
Here it is.

1043
01:01:07.006 --> 01:01:08.875
What's this?

1044
01:01:15.816 --> 01:01:16.816
What?

1045
01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:33.705
He was wearing a black cap and a black mask.

1046
01:01:33.705 --> 01:01:36.265
Jae Hyun was originally my man,

1047
01:01:36.906 --> 01:01:38.975
so you must give him back to me!

1048
01:01:39.006 --> 01:01:40.105
Do you know...

1049
01:01:40.805 --> 01:01:41.875
he was convicted for assault...

1050
01:01:41.875 --> 01:01:43.915
and was hospitalized in a mental institute before?

1051
01:02:00.296 --> 01:02:01.665
No.

1052
01:02:04.165 --> 01:02:05.636
It can't be.

1053
01:02:08.466 --> 01:02:10.776
It's can't be you, Jae Hyun.

1054
01:02:49.276 --> 01:02:52.375
(Manhole)

1055
01:02:53.116 --> 01:02:54.316
Come quickly.

1056
01:02:54.785 --> 01:02:56.145
I need to tell you something.

1057
01:02:56.586 --> 01:02:59.386
Soo Jin got into a hit-and-run accident.

1058
01:02:59.386 --> 01:03:01.355
You need to save Soo Jin!

1059
01:03:01.355 --> 01:03:03.495
I can't live if something happens to Soo Jin.

1060
01:03:03.656 --> 01:03:05.756
Can you please let me open up this manhole?

1061
01:03:06.296 --> 01:03:08.665
I was the one who said...

1062
01:03:08.895 --> 01:03:10.395
nothing bad will ever happen to you.

1063
01:03:10.566 --> 01:03:13.435
Do you remember anything about the accident?

1064
01:03:14.366 --> 01:03:17.935
I'll bring the evidence, so just you wait.
