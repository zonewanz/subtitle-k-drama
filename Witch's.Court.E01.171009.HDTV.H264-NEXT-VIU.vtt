00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:13.794
(1996)

4
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:32.941
(Episode 1)

5
00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:37.272
This way.

6
00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:38.672
Go.

7
00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.013
Come with me.

8
00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:05.873
Freeze. We're the police.

9
00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:29.163
Hey.

10
00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:31.993
Don't you think he's overdoing it a bit?

11
00:01:32.032 --> 00:01:33.163
Yes, a little.

12
00:01:33.163 --> 00:01:36.403
On TV, they catch them without using their guns.

13
00:01:36.403 --> 00:01:40.002
You're right. Don't they do that in foreign movies?

14
00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:42.903
Yes. And real detectives...

15
00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:46.073
are too busy to come to these places.

16
00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:50.043
You're right. Se Na's dad must not be busy.

17
00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:53.683
Okay. Who wants to try on these handcuffs?

18
00:01:53.683 --> 00:01:55.452
- Me! - Me!

19
00:01:55.452 --> 00:01:57.092
- Me! - Me!

20
00:01:57.092 --> 00:01:58.722
Isn't it kind of wrong...

21
00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:00.963
to put handcuffs on an innocent person?

22
00:02:00.963 --> 00:02:01.963
You're right.

23
00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.862
Hey. Ma Yi Deum. Jang Yoo Mi.

24
00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:07.502
You're just jealous, aren't you?

25
00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:08.503
- We are not. - We are not.

26
00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.733
As if.

27
00:02:09.902 --> 00:02:12.533
If you're so bitter, bring your dads too.

28
00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:15.302
That's right. You don't have dads.

29
00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:16.372
Stinks to be you.

30
00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:18.343
Why you...

31
00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:21.582
That hurts! Dad, shoot her.

32
00:02:21.582 --> 00:02:23.413
No fighting.

33
00:02:36.462 --> 00:02:41.763
(Yi Deum's Noodles)

34
00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:42.962
Let's get revenge.

35
00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:46.473
How?

36
00:02:46.573 --> 00:02:50.003
Ask your mom to make you a new dad.

37
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.313
A cop like Se Na's dad.

38
00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.112
My mom?

39
00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:03.723
- I take it back. - It's okay.

40
00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:04.922
If kids like us without dads....

41
00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:06.922
don't want to be looked down on,

42
00:03:06.922 --> 00:03:08.663
we have two options.

43
00:03:08.663 --> 00:03:09.763
What?

44
00:03:09.763 --> 00:03:11.733
Do crazy well in school,

45
00:03:11.932 --> 00:03:12.992
or...

46
00:03:13.802 --> 00:03:16.633
become a crazy pretty Miss Korea.

47
00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:19.432
That makes sense. Then I'll become Miss Korea.

48
00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:23.913
Yes, I think you have potential.

49
00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:27.043
Mom!

50
00:03:27.043 --> 00:03:30.142
Where did you hear such bad things?

51
00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:32.182
You always complain about not having a dad.

52
00:03:32.182 --> 00:03:34.952
What? I don't.

53
00:03:35.122 --> 00:03:36.823
Do you want me to lie that I do?

54
00:03:36.823 --> 00:03:38.422
At least you have a mom.

55
00:03:39.022 --> 00:03:41.763
Imagine if a brat like you didn't have a mom either.

56
00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.932
I don't have a mom either.

57
00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:50.473
You have your grandmother.

58
00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.503
She adores you so much.

59
00:03:53.772 --> 00:03:55.142
Anyway,

60
00:03:55.142 --> 00:03:57.443
you shouldn't whine about what you don't have.

61
00:03:57.443 --> 00:04:00.013
You should be thankful for what you have.

62
00:04:00.013 --> 00:04:01.983
That's how you make progress.

63
00:04:01.983 --> 00:04:03.513
- Breaking news. - Okay.

64
00:04:03.513 --> 00:04:08.122
The court found Chief of Police Cho Gap Soo...

65
00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.522
not guilty for sexual torture.

66
00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:13.193
He was accused of wrongful imprisonment...

67
00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:15.723
and sexual torture of female factory workers...

68
00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:20.033
for illegally striking in 1986. The court stated...

69
00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:23.463
there was insufficient evidence of his guilt.

70
00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.932
Please give us a statement.

71
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.543
How do you feel?

72
00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:29.043
Will you return to the force?

73
00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:33.112
A dog may bark,

74
00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:36.283
but the train must go its way.

75
00:04:39.182 --> 00:04:40.552
Will you appeal?

76
00:04:40.552 --> 00:04:42.882
What do you think about the decision?

77
00:04:48.023 --> 00:04:49.492
I strongly regret...

78
00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:52.393
that the court listened to the assailant's excuse...

79
00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:54.233
instead of the victim's testimony.

80
00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:57.233
The prosecution will not give in to this result.

81
00:04:57.802 --> 00:05:00.572
We'll prove the hideous crimes...

82
00:05:00.572 --> 00:05:03.843
Cho Gap Soo committed to innocent women.

83
00:05:05.213 --> 00:05:06.672
We'll wait for the victims in hiding...

84
00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:09.442
to make courageous decisions.

85
00:05:09.713 --> 00:05:11.182
Meanwhile, the victim...

86
00:05:11.182 --> 00:05:13.382
that claimed to have been raped by Cho Gap Soo...

87
00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:16.182
left a will complaining about the verdict...

88
00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:19.922
and jumped from the roof to commit suicide.

89
00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.122
The victim was a member of the union...

90
00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:23.862
at Hyungjae Factory in 1986.

91
00:05:23.862 --> 00:05:25.192
She participated in a strike...

92
00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:27.663
where she was arrested by the police...

93
00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.572
Mom, the knife. Knife!

94
00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:47.422
(Emergency)

95
00:05:54.422 --> 00:05:56.463
- Move out of the way! - Step back.

96
00:05:56.492 --> 00:05:57.932
Move!

97
00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:11.973
There's too much media.

98
00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.413
You should discharge tomorrow morning.

99
00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:18.812
What a bother.

100
00:06:19.252 --> 00:06:21.752
Also...

101
00:06:24.893 --> 00:06:26.223
It's regarding the victims.

102
00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.622
Will you really sue them for false accusations?

103
00:06:29.562 --> 00:06:32.593
It was hard to get the current verdict.

104
00:06:32.632 --> 00:06:34.163
What if there's a problem?

105
00:06:35.533 --> 00:06:37.502
Listen.

106
00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:43.043
You probably heard, but I passed the bar too.

107
00:06:43.973 --> 00:06:46.343
I didn't become a judge or a prosecutor,

108
00:06:46.983 --> 00:06:49.612
and was recruited by the police instead.

109
00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:59.552
If I end up leaving my post,

110
00:07:01.023 --> 00:07:03.093
I'm an attorney just like you.

111
00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:06.663
Do you understand me?

112
00:07:08.403 --> 00:07:09.463
Yes.

113
00:07:10.932 --> 00:07:13.942
Should I teach you a thing or two as your senior?

114
00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:17.742
If found not guilty, it's a false accusation!

115
00:07:17.913 --> 00:07:21.742
This is basic when it comes to rape cases.

116
00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:25.382
Yes, sir.

117
00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:27.822
I'll proceed with the complaint.

118
00:07:38.562 --> 00:07:41.703
What's the update? Did you find her?

119
00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:44.733
Well... Not yet.

120
00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:49.302
You were found innocent. I think you can rest easy.

121
00:07:51.213 --> 00:07:54.343
When we went to her house 10 years ago to get...

122
00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:57.182
her signature on paper not to sue me,

123
00:07:57.783 --> 00:07:59.853
I saw a cassette.

124
00:08:01.322 --> 00:08:03.793
That's what bothers me.

125
00:08:04.422 --> 00:08:07.822
If she had evidence, why would she stay quiet?

126
00:08:11.492 --> 00:08:14.703
She might have an ulterior motive.

127
00:08:20.172 --> 00:08:22.502
Hey! I hate that medicine.

128
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.343
- No, you need it. - It stings too much.

129
00:08:24.512 --> 00:08:26.742
Hold on. Just a little bit then.

130
00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:29.742
Hold on.

131
00:08:30.112 --> 00:08:31.552
Here I go.

132
00:08:32.983 --> 00:08:36.453
That stings! Be more gentle.

133
00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:37.892
You're such a crybaby.

134
00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:42.923
It's finished.

135
00:08:49.103 --> 00:08:50.433
Ma Yi Deum.

136
00:08:50.872 --> 00:08:51.872
Yes?

137
00:08:54.573 --> 00:08:56.443
Are you jealous of kids who have dads?

138
00:08:58.813 --> 00:09:01.612
Well... I guess...

139
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.083
I am these days.

140
00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:04.652
Then should I...

141
00:09:05.453 --> 00:09:07.853
get married to a handsome man...

142
00:09:08.522 --> 00:09:09.953
and make you a new stepdad?

143
00:09:12.323 --> 00:09:14.593
Why would a handsome man marry you?

144
00:09:15.362 --> 00:09:18.333
The world is not that easy.

145
00:09:19.132 --> 00:09:21.563
You're so rude.

146
00:09:21.803 --> 00:09:23.203
Come on!

147
00:09:30.673 --> 00:09:31.742
Hey.

148
00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:35.083
- Hey, Yi Deum. - What?

149
00:09:35.112 --> 00:09:37.012
Play with me!

150
00:09:37.012 --> 00:09:38.752
I'm reading a book!

151
00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:42.853
Gosh. What are you always studying to become?

152
00:09:43.053 --> 00:09:45.122
- A doctor. - A doctor?

153
00:09:45.953 --> 00:09:48.762
Sure, a doctor. That would be nice.

154
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.292
You can help the sick.

155
00:09:54.103 --> 00:09:57.103
You can go to remote places...

156
00:09:57.303 --> 00:09:59.473
- and volunteer too. - Volunteer?

157
00:10:00.473 --> 00:10:01.872
I'm not going to do that.

158
00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:04.642
I thought you were going to become a doctor.

159
00:10:05.242 --> 00:10:07.642
Yes. I'll become one and earn a lot of money.

160
00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:11.713
All you talk about is money.

161
00:10:11.882 --> 00:10:14.583
People will think your mom is homeless.

162
00:10:14.583 --> 00:10:16.423
I'm not doing this just for myself.

163
00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:19.193
I'm doing this for you.

164
00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.622
You don't know anything.

165
00:10:24.093 --> 00:10:25.563
Is that so?

166
00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:29.563
- Gosh, work hard. - Stop it...

167
00:10:29.803 --> 00:10:31.973
Let me live a luxury life thanks to you.

168
00:10:31.973 --> 00:10:33.032
Come here.

169
00:10:34.343 --> 00:10:36.343
Please, stop it.

170
00:10:40.742 --> 00:10:41.843
That hurt.

171
00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.782
Why won't you stop?

172
00:10:46.053 --> 00:10:47.122
It still hurts.

173
00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.723
(Cho Gap Soo)

174
00:11:30.892 --> 00:11:33.733
We'll prove the hideous crimes...

175
00:11:33.733 --> 00:11:35.002
Cho Gap Soo committed...

176
00:11:35.502 --> 00:11:37.473
to innocent women.

177
00:11:39.103 --> 00:11:40.803
We'll wait for the victims in hiding...

178
00:11:40.902 --> 00:11:43.173
to make courageous decisions.

179
00:12:20.382 --> 00:12:21.612
My friend,

180
00:12:22.912 --> 00:12:24.683
I'm sorry I came so late.

181
00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:28.122
I apologize.

182
00:12:57.353 --> 00:12:58.782
This is the Special Unit.

183
00:12:59.053 --> 00:13:02.382
Am I speaking to Prosecutor Min Ji Sook?

184
00:13:02.622 --> 00:13:03.853
Yes, this is she.

185
00:13:04.453 --> 00:13:06.093
I want to file a report.

186
00:13:07.492 --> 00:13:09.063
Yes, go ahead.

187
00:13:09.792 --> 00:13:11.632
It's regarding Cho Gap Soo.

188
00:13:13.233 --> 00:13:14.803
I have a tape...

189
00:13:15.563 --> 00:13:17.573
where Cho Gap Soo admits...

190
00:13:18.272 --> 00:13:20.402
what he did 10 years ago.

191
00:13:55.973 --> 00:13:58.612
Look who it is.

192
00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:03.882
It's the just prosecutor, Min Ji Sook.

193
00:14:04.353 --> 00:14:05.953
Good morning.

194
00:14:07.752 --> 00:14:10.522
Yes, I slept well very comfortably.

195
00:14:11.522 --> 00:14:14.463
This is why people say...

196
00:14:14.463 --> 00:14:15.892
you shouldn't commit a crime.

197
00:14:16.693 --> 00:14:19.093
You live up to your legend.

198
00:14:19.593 --> 00:14:21.203
You probably forgot...

199
00:14:21.463 --> 00:14:24.233
that the corpse of the victim...

200
00:14:24.673 --> 00:14:26.032
is just below us.

201
00:14:28.502 --> 00:14:32.242
You should have done a better job then.

202
00:14:42.823 --> 00:14:44.622
The trial isn't over yet,

203
00:14:44.892 --> 00:14:46.122
Cho Gap Soo.

204
00:14:56.973 --> 00:14:58.673
Did that woman...

205
00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:01.703
come here on purpose to annoy me?

206
00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:03.443
Well?

207
00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.882
(Cho Gap Soo)

208
00:15:35.843 --> 00:15:37.573
Excuse me. One moment, please.

209
00:15:39.943 --> 00:15:42.012
I'm sorry. It's an emergency.

210
00:16:52.313 --> 00:16:53.622
It's Min Ji Sook.

211
00:16:54.122 --> 00:16:55.453
I'm here.

212
00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:56.723
I'll wait for you.

213
00:17:10.847 --> 00:17:14.079

214
00:17:28.683 --> 00:17:31.893
The trial isn't over yet, Cho Gap Soo.

215
00:18:00.983 --> 00:18:02.052
Mom!

216
00:18:13.492 --> 00:18:15.332
I'm going to the market.

217
00:18:15.532 --> 00:18:17.032
I'll be back by 8am.

218
00:18:17.802 --> 00:18:19.433
Go eat breakfast at Yoo Mi's.

219
00:18:42.092 --> 00:18:43.522
We checked the CCTVs,

220
00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:45.562
but the resolution is bad and it's hard to tell.

221
00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:48.002
I think it was a prank call.

222
00:18:53.473 --> 00:18:54.572
Grandma!

223
00:18:56.203 --> 00:18:58.613
My child, what's the problem?

224
00:18:58.613 --> 00:19:00.042
Mom...

225
00:19:00.883 --> 00:19:02.983
Mom hasn't come home.

226
00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:05.852
- What? - She didn't come home.

227
00:19:08.552 --> 00:19:11.923
Kwak, who runs a diner in Janghyeon-dong,

228
00:19:11.923 --> 00:19:13.663
hasn't come home for 15 days.

229
00:19:13.663 --> 00:19:15.393
The police are under investigation.

230
00:19:15.393 --> 00:19:18.363
Have you seen a woman that looks like this...

231
00:19:18.363 --> 00:19:20.262
walking past here?

232
00:19:20.262 --> 00:19:22.562
Look at it carefully.

233
00:19:22.832 --> 00:19:23.933
- I don't think so. - No.

234
00:19:33.242 --> 00:19:35.683
This is my mom. Please call if you see her.

235
00:19:35.683 --> 00:19:36.812
This is my mom.

236
00:19:36.812 --> 00:19:39.653
This is my mom. Please report it...

237
00:19:41.552 --> 00:19:42.552

238
00:19:48.663 --> 00:19:50.223
- It's okay. - Please...

239
00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:52.863
Excuse me, this is my mom.

247
00:22:10.502 --> 00:22:11.572
Mom.

248

(Seoul, 2017)

263
00:23:23.643 --> 00:23:25.443
Hey, do you have a cigarette?

264
00:23:25.443 --> 00:23:27.183
I quit.

265
00:23:27.183 --> 00:23:30.143
How long are you planning to live?

266
00:23:30.312 --> 00:23:33.623
Gosh, I'm dying. How long has it been?

267
00:23:34.522 --> 00:23:36.322
- Shoot. Oh, no. - We came here...

268
00:23:36.322 --> 00:23:38.092
two days ago at 8am with the arrest.

269
00:23:38.252 --> 00:23:40.822
It's 4am now.

270
00:23:40.992 --> 00:23:42.923
It's been about 4 hours.

271
00:23:43.492 --> 00:23:46.832
That doctor looked like he knew the ins and outs.

272
00:23:46.832 --> 00:23:48.802
But his bank account is empty.

273
00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:50.433
Exactly. Someone claims they paid him,

274
00:23:50.433 --> 00:23:51.873
but we have no proof he received it.

275
00:23:51.873 --> 00:23:53.742
Our warrant will be rejected for sure.

276
00:23:53.742 --> 00:23:55.502
That's why he's still hanging in there.

277
00:23:55.502 --> 00:23:56.913
Exactly my point.

278
00:23:57.242 --> 00:23:59.913
Isn't Ms. Ma amazing?

279
00:23:59.943 --> 00:24:02.443
How did she manage to bring up...

280
00:24:02.443 --> 00:24:04.213
the corruption at the hospital?

281
00:24:04.213 --> 00:24:05.782
I admit she's talented.

282
00:24:05.782 --> 00:24:07.153
She's an ace.

283
00:24:07.153 --> 00:24:09.223
If she succeeds with this case,

284
00:24:09.223 --> 00:24:11.223
will she bypass you and get a promotion?

285
00:24:11.223 --> 00:24:12.322
She won't succeed.

286
00:24:13.153 --> 00:24:14.923
He'll be going to Macau in four hours...

287
00:24:14.923 --> 00:24:16.463
for his honeymoon.

288
00:24:16.463 --> 00:24:19.092
Macau? I'm so jealous.

289
00:24:19.092 --> 00:24:21.262
It's been so long since I had a vacation.

290
00:24:22.703 --> 00:24:25.002
- What did you say? - Hey, why...

291
00:24:25.002 --> 00:24:27.072
You said something about a honeymoon.

292
00:24:27.943 --> 00:24:29.143
Macau?

293
00:24:29.143 --> 00:24:30.143
Macau.

294
00:24:33.613 --> 00:24:35.443
You're dead meat.

295
00:24:43.483 --> 00:24:44.592
Ms. Son.

296
00:24:45.792 --> 00:24:47.762
Lee Do Jin's travel records. Hurry.

297
00:24:47.963 --> 00:24:49.022
Okay.

298
00:24:50.963 --> 00:24:52.032
What was that?

299
00:24:52.292 --> 00:24:54.302
Lee Do Jin. Macau.

300
00:24:55.863 --> 00:24:56.863
Okay.

301
00:24:59.802 --> 00:25:03.173
There's no use denying it.

302
00:25:21.663 --> 00:25:24.463
I can't get anything. What should I do?

303
00:25:24.963 --> 00:25:26.463
I told you...

304
00:25:27.802 --> 00:25:30.433
to wait until we had solid evidence.

305
00:25:32.072 --> 00:25:34.042
Who arrested him without anything?

306
00:25:35.403 --> 00:25:36.913
Where's Ma Yi Deum?

307
00:25:39.413 --> 00:25:40.443
Hey, Ma.

308
00:25:41.483 --> 00:25:42.782
What will you do about this?

309
00:25:42.943 --> 00:25:45.012
He won't say anything.

310
00:25:45.252 --> 00:25:47.582
We're going to look like complete idiots.

311
00:25:48.522 --> 00:25:49.852
I'll take care of it.

312
00:25:54.193 --> 00:25:55.363
What, punk?

313
00:25:55.663 --> 00:25:56.723
Why that...

314
00:26:04.703 --> 00:26:07.173
Let me head to the airport, will you?

315
00:26:08.042 --> 00:26:09.842
I need to get there...

316
00:26:09.842 --> 00:26:11.572
three hours before an international flight.

317
00:26:12.042 --> 00:26:14.012
You seem to like to travel.

318
00:26:14.282 --> 00:26:16.512
Why? Is that a problem too?

319
00:26:16.782 --> 00:26:20.252
Which of your trips abroad did you like best?

320
00:26:21.723 --> 00:26:23.352
What are you trying to do?

321
00:26:23.522 --> 00:26:25.923
I got curious, so I looked into it.

322
00:26:29.623 --> 00:26:31.433
Last January, Hong Kong, Macau.

323
00:26:31.663 --> 00:26:33.602
Last May, Hong Kong, Macau.

324
00:26:33.602 --> 00:26:35.963
Last July, Hong Kong, Macau.

325
00:26:36.002 --> 00:26:37.832
You must love Macau.

326
00:26:38.102 --> 00:26:40.542
I checked where you like to go domestically,

327
00:26:42.602 --> 00:26:44.113
and it was Jeongseon, Gangwon-do..

328
00:26:46.143 --> 00:26:47.643
There's a picture...

329
00:26:48.443 --> 00:26:50.282
that you took there that was nice.

330
00:27:01.963 --> 00:27:03.592
I went to just watch.

331
00:27:04.532 --> 00:27:06.832
And don't touch Mee Jin.

332
00:27:08.633 --> 00:27:11.173
Your fiancee isn't the one you should worry about.

333
00:27:13.903 --> 00:27:16.913
Do you know where I was before coming here?

334
00:27:19.272 --> 00:27:21.282
Special Unit, Chuncheon District Office.

335
00:27:24.413 --> 00:27:27.723
Wasn't she in the Criminal Trial Unit?

336
00:27:29.723 --> 00:27:31.752
She's using her skills again.

337
00:27:36.893 --> 00:27:40.703
I saw tons of jerks like you when I was there.

338
00:27:41.762 --> 00:27:42.832
Want to make a bet?

339
00:27:42.832 --> 00:27:46.572
Whether or not I find out which gambling houses...

340
00:27:46.572 --> 00:27:49.002
you went to, what you played and borrowed,

341
00:27:49.403 --> 00:27:51.242
Do you want to?

342
00:27:54.242 --> 00:27:56.082
What should we do?

343
00:27:56.443 --> 00:27:57.883
If we tack on illegal gambling...

344
00:27:57.883 --> 00:27:59.883
on top of illegal medical equipment,

345
00:28:00.483 --> 00:28:02.082
you'll lose your medical license.

346
00:28:06.092 --> 00:28:08.893
Will you give us a list of names and get just one,

347
00:28:09.693 --> 00:28:11.863
or will you deny it and get two?

348
00:28:15.403 --> 00:28:18.133
Of course, it's better for me if you get two.

349
00:28:19.173 --> 00:28:20.943
My review is coming up.

350
00:28:25.572 --> 00:28:28.643
How generous will you be if I give you the list?

351
00:28:29.943 --> 00:28:32.183
- We've got him. - Good work, sir.

352
00:28:41.423 --> 00:28:42.492
Good job, kid.

353
00:28:53.572 --> 00:28:55.572
It has been found that certain people...

354
00:28:55.873 --> 00:28:58.742
have received unnecessary shoulder surgery...

355
00:28:58.873 --> 00:29:00.812
to avoid mandatory military service.

356
00:29:01.143 --> 00:29:03.143
Among them were celebrities,

357
00:29:03.242 --> 00:29:06.082
athletes, and children of high officials,

358
00:29:06.082 --> 00:29:07.423
which has caused a stir.

359
00:29:07.653 --> 00:29:10.492
We'll give you more details soon...

360
00:29:10.693 --> 00:29:12.953
after the briefing by the Prosecutor's Office.

361
00:29:14.363 --> 00:29:18.062
We will pursue the harshest punishment.

362
00:29:18.762 --> 00:29:22.602
That ends the briefing.

363
00:29:23.233 --> 00:29:24.332
Finished!

364
00:29:27.042 --> 00:29:29.742
There's a ton of reporters here.

365
00:29:31.443 --> 00:29:33.582
Are you going out like that?

366
00:29:36.113 --> 00:29:37.282
Eye guck.

367
00:29:37.953 --> 00:29:40.953
Oh no. Dark circles. Darn it.

368
00:29:42.582 --> 00:29:46.092
Tap tap... Tap tap...

369
00:29:47.893 --> 00:29:48.923
Ms. Ma?

370
00:29:51.262 --> 00:29:53.332
When did that happen?

371
00:29:54.203 --> 00:29:55.233
Forget it.

372
00:30:05.673 --> 00:30:07.613
- How do I look? - Perfect.

373
00:30:14.282 --> 00:30:16.522
They performed shoulder surgery...

374
00:30:16.752 --> 00:30:18.492
on perfectly healthy shoulders,

375
00:30:18.592 --> 00:30:20.963
issued false diagnoses,

376
00:30:21.163 --> 00:30:23.592
and received 300,000 dollars in exchange.

377
00:30:24.092 --> 00:30:26.393
I found out what they were doing.

378
00:30:26.532 --> 00:30:29.403
I caught him when he tried to flee the country.

379
00:30:29.433 --> 00:30:32.802
I'm the one who got him to confess! Me!

380
00:30:32.802 --> 00:30:35.143
So? What could we do?

381
00:30:35.443 --> 00:30:37.512
Mr. Oh flipped out about a woman who never went...

382
00:30:37.512 --> 00:30:39.542
to the army giving the briefing.

383
00:30:39.613 --> 00:30:42.582
He sees me as a woman only at times like these!

384
00:30:42.582 --> 00:30:45.113
Let Woo have this one. He's more senior too.

385
00:30:45.183 --> 00:30:46.582
Senior, my foot.

386
00:30:46.953 --> 00:30:50.992
We believe there are more people involved...

387
00:30:51.893 --> 00:30:54.262
and plan to investigate further.

388
00:30:55.893 --> 00:30:58.032
I heard there was an important informant...

389
00:30:58.032 --> 00:31:00.363
that played a big role in getting the list.

390
00:31:01.802 --> 00:31:03.233
Who was that informant?

391
00:31:03.973 --> 00:31:06.673
Please tell us how you were able to get the list.

392
00:31:12.342 --> 00:31:14.383
That's not important.

393
00:31:14.383 --> 00:31:16.683
As the prosecutor in charge of the case,

394
00:31:16.683 --> 00:31:19.782
I think we should discuss that matter.

395
00:31:20.183 --> 00:31:21.252
Sir.

396
00:31:29.463 --> 00:31:30.532
Hello.

397
00:31:30.532 --> 00:31:31.663
I'm Ma Yi Deum,

398
00:31:31.663 --> 00:31:33.963
a prosecutor with Criminal Unit 2.

399
00:31:44.643 --> 00:31:47.443
It was not an informant, but the suspect's fiancee.

400
00:31:47.943 --> 00:31:50.852
She appealed to her future husband,

401
00:31:50.953 --> 00:31:52.953
and his conscience was moved.

402
00:31:53.213 --> 00:31:57.092
We were able to use that to get the list of names.

403
00:31:58.322 --> 00:32:00.492
We caught the suspect trying to leave...

404
00:32:00.522 --> 00:32:02.992
the country using his wedding as an excuse.

405
00:32:03.262 --> 00:32:06.332
I understand it stinks, but let Woo have this one.

406
00:32:06.492 --> 00:32:07.933
He's more senior too.

407
00:32:17.312 --> 00:32:18.772
I'm sorry.

408
00:32:24.352 --> 00:32:26.953
Isn't this that doctor?

409
00:32:27.352 --> 00:32:28.653
Who's the woman?

410
00:32:33.423 --> 00:32:35.492
I can't tell you right now.

411
00:32:36.193 --> 00:32:37.562
An informant?

412
00:32:40.092 --> 00:32:41.802
Please ask during the briefing.

413
00:32:45.102 --> 00:32:47.973
We hope this will help prevent...

414
00:32:47.973 --> 00:32:50.272
improper avoidance of military service.

415
00:32:50.812 --> 00:32:54.443
Once again, I am Ma Yi Deum.

416
00:32:54.613 --> 00:32:56.213
That concludes the briefing.

417
00:33:08.863 --> 00:33:10.463
Good job, Mr. Oh.

418
00:33:11.492 --> 00:33:12.492
Thank you.

419
00:33:15.002 --> 00:33:17.173
So you're Ma Yi Deum.

420
00:33:18.302 --> 00:33:19.602
I hear you're good at your job.

421
00:33:19.602 --> 00:33:21.272
Yes, sir. I'm kind of good.

422
00:33:21.403 --> 00:33:23.502
I'll do even better going forward.

423
00:33:24.143 --> 00:33:27.582
My love for you

424
00:33:27.582 --> 00:33:30.582
Is unconditional

425
00:33:30.812 --> 00:33:33.923
My love for you

426
00:33:34.252 --> 00:33:37.923
Is extra special

427
00:33:39.153 --> 00:33:42.463
I'll cross the Pacific, I'll cross the Atlantic

428
00:33:42.522 --> 00:33:45.762
I'll cross the Indian Ocean

429
00:33:46.163 --> 00:33:49.262
If you call me, I'll run to you

430
00:33:49.602 --> 00:33:52.973
I'll run right to you

431
00:33:57.572 --> 00:33:59.173
Thank you, Mr. Oh.

432
00:34:00.943 --> 00:34:03.913
- She's good. - Look at her.

433
00:34:05.052 --> 00:34:06.512
She's awesome.

434
00:34:07.623 --> 00:34:08.682
Hey, Ma.

435
00:34:09.452 --> 00:34:10.622
Stop singing,

436
00:34:11.622 --> 00:34:12.653
and come here.

437
00:34:14.093 --> 00:34:15.923
You're the only woman on our team.

438
00:34:16.792 --> 00:34:19.932
I want our only woman to pour me a drink.

439
00:34:22.562 --> 00:34:25.002
Of course. The only woman is coming.

440
00:34:28.502 --> 00:34:30.943
This is my go-to song. I'll go after this.

441
00:34:37.213 --> 00:34:39.553
Excuse me. Hello.

442
00:34:39.783 --> 00:34:41.252
The beautiful reporter, Ms. Han.

443
00:34:45.823 --> 00:34:46.823
Here.

444
00:35:01.272 --> 00:35:05.073
When will you disclose the list to the public?

445
00:35:06.443 --> 00:35:09.483
Help me get an exclusive.

446
00:35:13.682 --> 00:35:17.093
I'll help you all the way.

447
00:35:20.863 --> 00:35:21.863
Well...

448
00:35:22.763 --> 00:35:25.162
Jaeil News' reporter got an exclusive before,

449
00:35:25.162 --> 00:35:27.363
so I was almost fired, you know.

450
00:35:28.062 --> 00:35:31.702
Word among reporters is that you had his back.

451
00:35:35.403 --> 00:35:37.142
I don't remember.

452
00:35:43.082 --> 00:35:45.713
Please don't be like that.

453
00:35:45.713 --> 00:35:48.752
Can you at least give me the initials?

454
00:35:50.082 --> 00:35:51.452
For free?

455
00:35:52.792 --> 00:35:53.792
Really?

456
00:35:55.193 --> 00:35:57.133
Then how about a love shot?

457
00:35:57.292 --> 00:35:58.792
Forget that.

458
00:36:00.033 --> 00:36:03.033
Ms. Han. Why are you so stiff?

459
00:36:03.562 --> 00:36:06.173
If you want an exclusive, you need to provide...

460
00:36:06.173 --> 00:36:09.042
some intimacy with the informant.

461
00:36:09.042 --> 00:36:11.173
Stop, sir.

462
00:36:12.272 --> 00:36:13.343
Stop.

463
00:36:15.713 --> 00:36:17.312
Excuse me.

464
00:36:18.182 --> 00:36:19.283
Please stop.

465
00:36:22.522 --> 00:36:24.823
I should chop off his hand.

466
00:36:24.823 --> 00:36:26.522
Come on.

467
00:36:26.522 --> 00:36:28.263
Please.

468
00:36:28.263 --> 00:36:30.263
Excuse me.

469
00:36:30.263 --> 00:36:32.062
- Come on. - Oh, my gosh.

470
00:36:32.062 --> 00:36:34.463
- Mr. Oh, you're drunk. - What?

471
00:36:34.463 --> 00:36:36.403
- Please. - Hey.

472
00:36:36.403 --> 00:36:37.733
Stop it.

473
00:36:37.733 --> 00:36:39.872
Stop what?

474
00:36:41.372 --> 00:36:42.372
Stop.

475
00:36:47.312 --> 00:36:48.713
Stop it.

476
00:37:15.943 --> 00:37:17.972
You should've been careful.

477
00:37:17.972 --> 00:37:19.272
Come on.

478
00:37:19.272 --> 00:37:21.113
- Careful. - Hey.

479
00:37:21.113 --> 00:37:22.542
Careful.

480
00:37:22.542 --> 00:37:25.153
- Hey. - You get in first.

481
00:37:25.153 --> 00:37:26.513
- Goodbye. - That hurts.

482
00:37:26.513 --> 00:37:28.283
That hurts.

483
00:37:28.283 --> 00:37:29.852
- Good night. - Good night.

484
00:37:29.852 --> 00:37:30.923
Get home safely.

485
00:37:33.553 --> 00:37:35.392
I'm so tired.

486
00:37:35.792 --> 00:37:37.193
He's wasted.

487
00:37:37.193 --> 00:37:38.932
He fell down the stairs hard.

488
00:37:39.892 --> 00:37:43.233
He didn't fall. He was kicked.

489
00:37:43.233 --> 00:37:44.233
What?

490
00:37:44.872 --> 00:37:46.403
I'm going home.

491
00:37:51.173 --> 00:37:52.213
Sober up.

492
00:39:13.093 --> 00:39:14.093
Eight floor.

493
00:39:17.493 --> 00:39:18.533
Excuse me.

494
00:39:19.093 --> 00:39:20.263
Aren't you going to press it?

495
00:39:21.303 --> 00:39:22.303
Pardon?

496
00:39:22.763 --> 00:39:24.372
What floor are you going to?

497
00:39:25.903 --> 00:39:26.943
The eighth floor.

498
00:39:27.903 --> 00:39:29.303
I'm sure you are.

499
00:39:29.443 --> 00:39:33.642
Seriously. This is a night filled with perverts.

500
00:39:34.843 --> 00:39:35.843
Pardon?

501
00:39:35.843 --> 00:39:37.013
Pardon what?

502
00:39:37.013 --> 00:39:39.452
I'm talking about you.

503
00:39:41.823 --> 00:39:45.222
- Why is that? - I knew you were weird.

504
00:39:45.222 --> 00:39:48.122
You waited over there, but once I pressed this,

505
00:39:48.122 --> 00:39:50.263
you got in after me.

506
00:39:50.693 --> 00:39:53.133
I didn't know that one was for odd floors.

507
00:39:54.403 --> 00:39:55.403
What about this?

508
00:39:55.602 --> 00:39:56.803
I live on the eighth floor.

509
00:39:58.472 --> 00:40:01.243
Good. Let's go then.

510
00:40:01.243 --> 00:40:03.872
I'll report you if you're lying.

511
00:40:04.142 --> 00:40:05.142
Excuse me.

512
00:40:05.912 --> 00:40:08.142
Don't you think you're going overboard?

513
00:40:08.142 --> 00:40:10.412
Exactly. So go.

514
00:40:28.633 --> 00:40:30.733
Look at that sweat on your back.

515
00:40:31.202 --> 00:40:32.602
Just confess.

516
00:40:35.443 --> 00:40:37.713
Where are you going? That's my place...

517
00:40:49.682 --> 00:40:50.693
Happy?

518
00:40:57.832 --> 00:40:59.133
So embarrassing.

519
00:41:05.133 --> 00:41:06.502
Seriously.

520
00:41:07.042 --> 00:41:08.903
This is that rat Mr. Oh's fault.

521
00:41:09.102 --> 00:41:11.772
I'm so humiliated. Oh my gosh.

522
00:41:19.983 --> 00:41:21.082
What do I do?

523
00:41:22.823 --> 00:41:23.923
That reporter...

524
00:41:26.752 --> 00:41:27.792
No.

525
00:41:28.493 --> 00:41:29.792
It's not my business.

526
00:41:31.263 --> 00:41:32.763
It's not your business, Yi Deum.

527
00:41:35.133 --> 00:41:36.972
It's not your business, Yi Deum.

528
00:41:41.303 --> 00:41:44.513
(2 weeks later)

529
00:41:45.343 --> 00:41:46.542
(Subpoena)

530
00:41:46.542 --> 00:41:47.943
What's this?

531
00:41:48.182 --> 00:41:50.383
Ms. Son. What's this?

532
00:41:54.283 --> 00:41:55.823
It really came.

533
00:41:55.923 --> 00:41:58.323
- What is it? - Joonga News' Ms. Han.

534
00:41:58.323 --> 00:42:00.863
She reported Mr. Oh for sexual harassment.

535
00:42:01.923 --> 00:42:03.263
Who's the prosecutor on the case?

536
00:42:03.263 --> 00:42:05.033
I'm sure he's one of Mr. Oh's people.

537
00:42:05.033 --> 00:42:08.863
No. I think Mr. Oh is going to get it this time.

538
00:42:08.932 --> 00:42:11.372
The person in charge of this case...

539
00:42:11.372 --> 00:42:13.602
is Mr. Kim from Criminal Unit 8.

540
00:42:13.602 --> 00:42:16.142
The one whose promotion Mr. Oh took.

541
00:42:16.142 --> 00:42:19.542
And the investigator is supposed to be awesome.

542
00:42:19.542 --> 00:42:20.713
You punk.

543
00:42:22.213 --> 00:42:23.613
This rat.

544
00:42:25.452 --> 00:42:27.752
Don't you touch girls when you're drunk?

545
00:42:28.522 --> 00:42:29.522
Hey.

546
00:42:29.783 --> 00:42:32.093
If this is sexual harassment,

547
00:42:32.292 --> 00:42:35.423
every man in Korea needs to be locked up!

548
00:42:36.463 --> 00:42:37.832
Punk.

549
00:42:47.243 --> 00:42:49.272
What's that psycho's name?

550
00:42:50.173 --> 00:42:52.812
Yeo... Something.

551
00:42:52.812 --> 00:42:53.843
Yeo?

552
00:43:01.222 --> 00:43:03.323
(Prosecutor Yeo Jin Wook)

553
00:43:07.993 --> 00:43:11.033
What? He looks normal for a psycho.

554
00:43:17.073 --> 00:43:18.073
It's you, isn't it?

555
00:43:20.343 --> 00:43:21.642
The other day in that elevator.

556
00:43:22.343 --> 00:43:26.142
You do seem vaguely familiar, but no.

557
00:43:27.113 --> 00:43:28.483
I'll begin.

558
00:43:28.883 --> 00:43:31.383
You're a busy person, so I'll be quick.

559
00:43:33.113 --> 00:43:36.323
I hate getting involved in other people's matters.

560
00:43:37.193 --> 00:43:39.553
It isn't "other people's matters" if you saw it.

561
00:43:41.622 --> 00:43:43.522
Can you hear what I'm thinking?

562
00:43:43.993 --> 00:43:45.392
It's written on your face.

563
00:43:47.403 --> 00:43:48.733
I don't remember...

564
00:43:49.702 --> 00:43:51.002
what happened that day.

565
00:43:51.002 --> 00:43:52.772
I was wasted.

566
00:43:52.772 --> 00:43:55.403
I can't remember random parts of the night.

567
00:43:55.403 --> 00:43:57.912
Ms. Ma. Do you know something?

568
00:43:58.872 --> 00:44:00.883
Witnesses to a crime...

569
00:44:00.883 --> 00:44:03.713
often suffer similarly as the victims.

570
00:44:04.912 --> 00:44:06.483
At the elevator,

571
00:44:07.483 --> 00:44:10.892
I was carrying a plastic bag with water in it.

572
00:44:10.892 --> 00:44:12.892
I was wearing trainers and slippers.

573
00:44:12.892 --> 00:44:14.493
It was obvious...

574
00:44:14.722 --> 00:44:17.093
that I lived there.

575
00:44:17.392 --> 00:44:20.093
But what did you say as soon as you saw me?

576
00:44:20.633 --> 00:44:24.772
Seriously. This is a night filled with perverts.

577
00:44:25.533 --> 00:44:27.142
That night,

578
00:44:27.272 --> 00:44:29.943
you probably saw Mr. Oh sexually harass Ms. Han.

579
00:44:30.343 --> 00:44:32.042
You saw it clearly.

580
00:44:33.472 --> 00:44:35.082
You couldn't have liked watching that...

581
00:44:35.082 --> 00:44:36.812
happen to a fellow woman.

582
00:44:36.912 --> 00:44:38.412
And sex offenders...

583
00:44:39.553 --> 00:44:41.582
usually have their own patterns.

584
00:44:42.153 --> 00:44:43.622
I'm sure...

585
00:44:44.392 --> 00:44:46.392
you experienced something similar.

586
00:44:47.093 --> 00:44:48.193
Good job, kid.

587
00:44:50.863 --> 00:44:53.803
Hey, Ma. You're the only woman on our team.

588
00:44:54.102 --> 00:44:57.372
I want our only woman to pour me a drink.

589
00:44:58.272 --> 00:45:01.743
That's why you were much more confrontational...

590
00:45:02.343 --> 00:45:04.972
and overreacted when you saw me. Right?

591
00:45:07.883 --> 00:45:09.283
Please tell me.

592
00:45:10.283 --> 00:45:11.653
You saw, didn't you?

593
00:45:12.252 --> 00:45:13.352
Yes.

594
00:45:13.682 --> 00:45:14.752
Yes.

595
00:45:16.283 --> 00:45:17.292
No.

596
00:45:18.352 --> 00:45:20.263
- You just said, "Yes." - Me?

597
00:45:20.392 --> 00:45:22.423
No. I said, "No."

598
00:45:24.133 --> 00:45:25.533
I'm done.

599
00:45:25.593 --> 00:45:28.233
I was too drunk, and I can't remember.

600
00:45:31.772 --> 00:45:32.932
Really?

601
00:45:33.403 --> 00:45:34.972
That's awesome.

602
00:45:39.243 --> 00:45:40.412
Okay.

603
00:45:41.582 --> 00:45:42.812
Let's chat later.

604
00:45:44.613 --> 00:45:45.653
Ms. Ma.

605
00:45:47.582 --> 00:45:48.653
Yes?

606
00:45:48.752 --> 00:45:51.653
I just heard something very interesting...

607
00:45:51.653 --> 00:45:53.823
about Mr. Yeo.

608
00:45:54.222 --> 00:45:56.763
He used to be a psychiatrist.

609
00:45:57.763 --> 00:46:00.662
He was top of his class all through law school.

610
00:46:00.803 --> 00:46:02.803
And he scored the highest on the bar exam.

611
00:46:02.803 --> 00:46:03.872
Isn't that incredible?

612
00:46:04.472 --> 00:46:05.733
He was a psychiatrist?

613
00:46:06.772 --> 00:46:07.972
No wonder.

614
00:46:09.303 --> 00:46:10.412
Why?

615
00:46:12.343 --> 00:46:15.743
Did you tell him everything you saw?

616
00:46:16.082 --> 00:46:17.613
Ms. Son.

617
00:46:19.252 --> 00:46:21.553
Do you think tricks he uses on petty offenders...

618
00:46:21.553 --> 00:46:22.783
would work on me?

619
00:46:23.522 --> 00:46:24.553
On me?

620
00:46:27.823 --> 00:46:29.423
Hello? Ma Yi Deum speaking.

621
00:46:31.263 --> 00:46:32.292
Yes, sir.

622
00:46:32.432 --> 00:46:34.233
You saw the deputy at the briefing, right?

623
00:46:35.533 --> 00:46:38.173
Mr. Park is getting promoted to director.

624
00:46:39.602 --> 00:46:43.272
He's considering you and Woo for the last spot...

625
00:46:44.372 --> 00:46:47.682
on the Special Unit for the upcoming assignments.

626
00:46:48.743 --> 00:46:51.713
You've been asking for the Special Unit...

627
00:46:52.082 --> 00:46:54.082
- every time, right? - Yes.

628
00:46:56.252 --> 00:46:57.993
If you handle...

629
00:46:58.452 --> 00:47:00.292
Ms. Han for me,

630
00:47:00.892 --> 00:47:03.463
you may be able to join that unit.

631
00:47:04.133 --> 00:47:07.832
I gave my statement that I don't remember...

632
00:47:08.202 --> 00:47:09.463
to the prosecutor already

633
00:47:12.133 --> 00:47:13.702
That's not enough.

634
00:47:15.002 --> 00:47:17.312
You know the disciplinary hearing is tomorrow.

635
00:47:18.113 --> 00:47:20.943
Beg or threaten Ms. Han.

636
00:47:21.113 --> 00:47:23.182
Get her to drop the charges.

637
00:47:25.412 --> 00:47:28.383
Since you're both women, you'll get through to her.

638
00:47:29.452 --> 00:47:31.852
Take care of Ms. Han,

639
00:47:35.093 --> 00:47:36.323
and let's go up together.

640
00:47:54.812 --> 00:47:56.013
Mom.

641
00:48:38.323 --> 00:48:39.752
Who is it?

642
00:48:40.122 --> 00:48:41.622
Mommy.

643
00:48:42.093 --> 00:48:43.093
Come here.

644
00:48:55.772 --> 00:48:57.443
Drop the charges?

645
00:49:01.013 --> 00:49:03.312
Mr. Oh is impressive.

646
00:49:05.182 --> 00:49:08.252
He got my editor to tell me to drop the charges,

647
00:49:09.053 --> 00:49:11.193
and now he sends a prosecutor to my home?

648
00:49:14.062 --> 00:49:16.993
You saw what he did to me that night.

649
00:49:18.792 --> 00:49:20.562
Aren't you angry as a fellow woman?

650
00:49:20.803 --> 00:49:22.432
He said the same.

651
00:49:22.432 --> 00:49:25.702
That as a fellow woman, I'll get through to you.

652
00:49:28.403 --> 00:49:31.912
A female reporter was sexually harassed...

653
00:49:31.912 --> 00:49:33.443
by an assistant chief prosecutor.

654
00:49:33.743 --> 00:49:36.142
Other female reporters were there too,

655
00:49:36.483 --> 00:49:39.312
so she had a much stronger case than you.

656
00:49:39.713 --> 00:49:41.122
What do you think happened?

657
00:49:42.323 --> 00:49:44.952
The prosecutor on the case delayed investigating,

658
00:49:45.122 --> 00:49:46.852
and eventually stayed the case.

659
00:49:47.162 --> 00:49:50.493
The assistant chief prosecutor is now a chief.

660
00:49:51.263 --> 00:49:52.392
That woman quit,

661
00:49:52.562 --> 00:49:55.763
got treated for depression and is moving...

662
00:49:56.062 --> 00:49:57.602
to Australia or New Zealand.

663
00:49:58.372 --> 00:50:00.573
Be wise, Ms. Han.

664
00:50:01.102 --> 00:50:03.613
You people are incredible.

665
00:50:05.542 --> 00:50:09.142
A 70-year-old man got one year for sexual assault...

666
00:50:09.142 --> 00:50:11.713
for kissing a 7-year-old for being cute.

667
00:50:13.582 --> 00:50:16.852
But that scumbag who hugs a reporter, touches her,

668
00:50:17.823 --> 00:50:19.553
and follows her to the bathroom...

669
00:50:19.622 --> 00:50:22.823
and forcefully kisses her is innocent?

670
00:50:24.133 --> 00:50:26.193
He'll counter with a suit for filing a false claim.

671
00:50:26.363 --> 00:50:27.562
Mr. Oh...

672
00:50:27.733 --> 00:50:30.633
can destroy a reporter without breaking a sweat.

673
00:50:31.872 --> 00:50:33.803
How dare you threaten me?

674
00:50:48.783 --> 00:50:49.923
Hit me.

675
00:50:51.593 --> 00:50:52.693
What?

676
00:50:52.823 --> 00:50:56.722
Pretend I'm Mr. Oh. Let it out and hit me.

677
00:51:07.502 --> 00:51:09.542
You're incredible.

678
00:51:10.772 --> 00:51:12.972
Do you want to succeed this badly?

679
00:51:13.812 --> 00:51:16.513
I don't care what you say. Drop the charges.

680
00:51:16.513 --> 00:51:18.713
That's the only way you and I can survive.

681
00:51:18.783 --> 00:51:21.823
Mr. Oh will never apologize.

682
00:51:22.082 --> 00:51:24.792
Either you lose a year later or you drop it now.

683
00:51:25.222 --> 00:51:26.653
The result will be the same.

684
00:51:27.323 --> 00:51:28.392
Hit me.

685
00:51:38.803 --> 00:51:40.033
Three dollars, please.

686
00:51:43.573 --> 00:51:44.743
Thank you.

687
00:52:16.743 --> 00:52:18.013
Oh my gosh.

688
00:52:18.113 --> 00:52:19.542
- No. - Wait!

689
00:52:19.542 --> 00:52:21.542
- Sir. - Good.

690
00:52:21.713 --> 00:52:23.312
I'll open your door.

691
00:52:26.483 --> 00:52:29.122
Please look kindly on Woo.

692
00:52:30.752 --> 00:52:33.693
I'm closing the door. Be careful.

693
00:52:33.963 --> 00:52:35.562
Get home safely.

694
00:52:39.193 --> 00:52:40.233
Let's go.

695
00:52:40.633 --> 00:52:42.533
- Thank you. - Sure.

696
00:52:42.533 --> 00:52:44.173
- Let's go. - Let's go!

697
00:52:45.202 --> 00:52:47.372
- Thank you. - It's a done deal.

(Supreme Prosecutors' Office)

699
00:53:00.213 --> 00:53:02.722
I was drunk, so I don't remember,

700
00:53:04.593 --> 00:53:06.993
but I apologize if Ms. Han felt uncomfortable.

701
00:53:07.763 --> 00:53:10.633
However, please know that I didn't kiss her...

702
00:53:10.693 --> 00:53:13.832
against her will or anything like that.

703
00:53:14.102 --> 00:53:15.102
Ms. Han.

704
00:53:15.432 --> 00:53:18.932
Mr. Oh apologized, so let's end it here.

705
00:53:19.772 --> 00:53:21.472
- What? - That's right.

706
00:53:21.943 --> 00:53:23.502
We'll have to keep seeing each other.

707
00:53:23.812 --> 00:53:25.843
Don't be mad, and let's get along.

708
00:53:26.013 --> 00:53:27.343
That is not right.

709
00:53:27.682 --> 00:53:28.743
What, punk?

710
00:53:28.812 --> 00:53:32.153
We have clear proof of Mr. Oh's sexual assault.

711
00:53:39.653 --> 00:53:41.493
Please consider these in making your decision.

712

Yeo Jin Wook.

713
00:53:43.263 --> 00:53:45.832
This is a disciplinary hearing, not a trial.

714
00:53:46.432 --> 00:53:49.303
We aren't here to argue what's wrong or right.

715
00:53:49.363 --> 00:53:50.533
Sir...

716
00:54:05.713 --> 00:54:07.022
I'm Ma Yi Deum.

717
00:54:07.452 --> 00:54:10.292
I will testify as to what happened that day.

718
00:54:10.292 --> 00:54:11.323
Okay.

719
00:54:11.693 --> 00:54:14.423
Tell them everything that happened.

720
00:54:14.823 --> 00:54:15.863
Yes, sir!

721
00:54:17.193 --> 00:54:20.832
Ms. Han entered the room around 11:30pm.

722
00:54:21.162 --> 00:54:23.903
She came to ask about the list of offenders.

723
00:54:24.073 --> 00:54:26.832
She sat next to Mr. Oh and questioned him about it.

724
00:54:26.903 --> 00:54:29.102
Mr. Oh touched Ms. Han's thigh three times,

725
00:54:29.102 --> 00:54:30.772
rubbed her shoulders twice,

726
00:54:30.872 --> 00:54:33.272
and hugged her against her will once.

727
00:54:33.372 --> 00:54:36.142
Ms. Han was uncomfortable with his conduct,

728
00:54:36.142 --> 00:54:39.013
and fled to the bathroom at 12:10am.

729
00:54:39.283 --> 00:54:41.252
Mr. Oh followed her,

730
00:54:41.283 --> 00:54:44.452
shoved her up against the wall, and kissed her.

731
00:54:45.792 --> 00:54:48.923
I also saw Ms. Han stomp on his left foot...

732
00:54:48.923 --> 00:54:50.733
with her heel.

733
00:54:56.533 --> 00:54:57.533
What are you doing?

734
00:54:58.002 --> 00:54:59.733
Stop that.

735
00:55:01.573 --> 00:55:03.073
This is evidence of what happened.

736
00:55:10.312 --> 00:55:12.213
You told me to settle this case...

737
00:55:12.213 --> 00:55:14.423
and join the Special Unit together, right?

738
00:55:15.622 --> 00:55:18.193
Considering the two years that I worked for you,

739
00:55:18.392 --> 00:55:21.693
if you apologize sincerely to Ms. Han now,

740
00:55:22.062 --> 00:55:24.593
I'll keep quiet about that.

741
00:55:25.432 --> 00:55:28.033
What will you do, sir?

742
00:55:31.432 --> 00:55:34.542
- Are you insane? - You lied to me.

743
00:55:34.542 --> 00:55:38.113
- What? - I was tempted at first.

744
00:55:38.113 --> 00:55:40.113
But I started to doubt whether you,

745
00:55:40.113 --> 00:55:43.182
who hated me for two years would take me with you...

746
00:55:43.182 --> 00:55:45.352
to the Special Unit.

747
00:55:45.352 --> 00:55:48.222
And coincidentally, as I left Ms. Han's apartment,

748
00:55:48.222 --> 00:55:50.352
I saw you and Woo with the deputy... No.

749
00:55:50.352 --> 00:55:54.193
I saw you two kiss up to Director Park.

750
00:55:54.562 --> 00:55:56.622
I looked into it,

751
00:55:56.823 --> 00:56:00.263
and it was contrary to what you promised me.

752
00:56:00.263 --> 00:56:01.263
Is that why...

753
00:56:01.263 --> 00:56:04.573
I can't bring you success, but I can ruin you.

754
00:56:04.702 --> 00:56:07.173
I can't get into the Special Unit anyway.

755
00:56:07.173 --> 00:56:08.943
You shouldn't either! That's only fair!

756
00:56:08.943 --> 00:56:10.142
Why you...

757
00:56:13.113 --> 00:56:14.743
Oops. Sorry.

758
00:56:16.412 --> 00:56:18.783
Since I'm sorry anyway, let me add on rudeness.

759
00:56:18.783 --> 00:56:19.883
What?

760
00:56:20.082 --> 00:56:22.222
Hey, you. Oh Soo Chul.

761
00:56:23.252 --> 00:56:24.553
Don't touch me.

762
00:56:24.553 --> 00:56:27.292
Do you know why I always sing at our outings?

763
00:56:27.463 --> 00:56:30.093
You touch me whenever I sit next to you.

764
00:56:30.193 --> 00:56:32.363
And stop blowing air into my ear, pretending like...

765
00:56:32.363 --> 00:56:35.002
you're saying something important when it's not!

766
00:56:35.002 --> 00:56:36.463
I'm not a balloon!

767
00:56:37.772 --> 00:56:38.803
Seriously.

768
00:56:38.803 --> 00:56:40.573
- Why you little... - That's right.

769
00:56:41.073 --> 00:56:42.772
At my first team dinner,

770
00:56:42.772 --> 00:56:44.213
you grabbed my face...

771
00:56:44.213 --> 00:56:46.843
and kissed me, saying I was like a daughter.

772
00:56:46.843 --> 00:56:49.743
I should press charges for sexual harassment too.

773
00:56:51.452 --> 00:56:52.553
I'm leaving.

774
00:57:39.033 --> 00:57:41.162
Ms. Oh is dropping the charges.

775
00:57:42.363 --> 00:57:43.903
And she thanks you...

776
00:57:44.472 --> 00:57:46.573
for what you did at the disciplinary hearing.

777
00:57:46.903 --> 00:57:49.142
I see. Okay.

778
00:57:51.673 --> 00:57:52.743
Ms. Ma.

779
00:57:55.343 --> 00:57:56.513
I see...

780
00:57:56.883 --> 00:57:58.452
that you're a very good person.

781
00:58:00.113 --> 00:58:01.222
And?

782
00:58:04.292 --> 00:58:05.292
Well...

783
00:58:05.653 --> 00:58:08.363
Let's meet under better circumstances next time.

784
00:58:09.093 --> 00:58:10.863
That won't happen.

785
00:58:11.193 --> 00:58:12.763
Let's not meet again.

786
00:58:29.983 --> 00:58:31.053
Congratulations.

787
00:58:31.053 --> 00:58:33.923
You're finally a PWNF.

788
00:58:35.022 --> 00:58:36.153

Prosecutor With No Future.

790
00:58:38.493 --> 00:58:39.892
Says who?

791
00:58:39.892 --> 00:58:41.363
I haven't given up on my future.

792
00:58:41.722 --> 00:58:42.792
Sure.

793
00:58:42.792 --> 00:58:44.932
A person needs to have hope.

794
00:58:45.963 --> 00:58:47.863
I'll do that later.

795
00:58:48.033 --> 00:58:49.662
I'm packing my things.

796
00:58:49.662 --> 00:58:52.173
I'll end up where you go, so I'm packing in advance.

797

Oh, CAGU?

Ms. Min Ji Sook started that unit.

and worked only on sexual assault cases.

812
00:59:33.073 --> 00:59:35.912
But everyone is trying to avoid that unit.

813
00:59:35.912 --> 00:59:38.352
I'm going to lose my mind.

814

I volunteered.

823
01:01:00.662 --> 01:01:03.303
You volunteered to join the unit everyone avoids.

824
01:01:03.303 --> 01:01:05.903
Are you saying he raped a female teacher?

825
01:01:05.903 --> 01:01:07.073
I won't talk.

826
01:01:07.073 --> 01:01:09.403
Will you submit to it after we get a warrant...

827
01:01:09.403 --> 01:01:11.042
or do it quietly now?

828

01:01:20.983 --> 01:01:22.323
I refuse to testify.

834
01:01:22.323 --> 01:01:24.022
We should punish the crime and the criminal.

835
01:01:24.022 --> 01:01:26.292
Must we consider the perp's personal life?
