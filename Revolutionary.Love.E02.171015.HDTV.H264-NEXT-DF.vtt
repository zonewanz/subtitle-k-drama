00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:27.900
I think I'm in love with Joon.

3
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.902
I think I've finally met my soulmate.

4
00:01:15.687 --> 00:01:18.012
<i>[Episode 2]</i>
Joon.

5
00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:20.423
How can this food be so delicious?

6
00:01:20.423 --> 00:01:22.917
You know good food.
Do you want some more?

7
00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:24.602
500 won for an extra
bowl of rice, okay?

8
00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:26.539
- I'm in.
- Okay.

9
00:01:30.753 --> 00:01:35.114
This place with my soulmate and
my one and only childhood friend.

10
00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:38.176
This is my true paradise.

11
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:52.527
You look really surprised.

12
00:01:52.527 --> 00:01:54.250
Did you lose something?

13
00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:59.795
Ah, thank you for letting me
stay over yesterday, friend.

14
00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.054
Would you like to eat with us?

15
00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.492
Friend?

16
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.979
Why didn't you tell me
you were going up?

17
00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.417
You disappeared suddenly,
so I was looking for you.

18
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.517
You two are still speaking
formally to each another?

19
00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:14.672
Oh, Jae Hoon here isn't very outgoing.

20
00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:21.774
You should put away your blankets if
I allowed you to stay the night.

21
00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:23.842
Of course, my friend.

22
00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.670
First, let me have some rice.

23
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.469
Please tidy it up right now.

24
00:02:31.254 --> 00:02:34.522
Sure. I can do that, friend.

25
00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:41.219
Hey, did your chairman's son
cause trouble again?

26
00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.898
What is wrong with this guy?

27
00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:46.367
What is it? Which one is it?

28
00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:48.767
Hey, Kwon Jae Hoon. You're on TV now.

29
00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:49.827
Oh, it's this one.

30
00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:54.005
<i>The airplane disturbance case has
caused a great deal of controversy.</i>

31
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:58.170
<i>Gangsu Group has yet to release
any official statement on the matter.</i>

32
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.142
<i>At this time,
no formal charges have been made.</i>

33
00:03:02.142 --> 00:03:04.820
<i>People are lobbying
to have this case dismissed.</i>

34
00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:07.640
Lobbying to have the case dismissed?

35
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.932
Joon, the thing is...

36
00:03:10.932 --> 00:03:14.589
I guess you'll be busy again taking
care this rich reckless troublemaker.

37
00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.860
<i>Reckless troublemaker?</i>

38
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.529
<i>Why am I?</i>

39
00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:21.479
If he was born with
a silver spoon in his mouth

40
00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.428
he should be thankful and live quietly.

41
00:03:23.428 --> 00:03:26.040
Where does he get off acting
high and mighty with money?

42
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.875
People like this need to be erased
from the world. They're just evil.

43
00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:34.393
If this guy were in front
of me now... he'd be dead.

44
00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.352
<i>[Right here.]</i>

45
00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.742
Then there's you,
who makes money protecting him...

46
00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:43.289
I'd like to call the stations
and give them a tip.

47
00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:47.612
I'll hold myself back
because I'm very busy with work.

48
00:03:47.612 --> 00:03:49.629
You can do it if you want.

49
00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.909
- What?
- Don't hold back. Do what you want.

50
00:03:54.123 --> 00:03:55.957
<i>Troublemaker.</i>

51
00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:59.380
<i>Troublemaker, troublemaker...</i>

52
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.469
- Clean up your blankets.
- <i>Troublemaker...</i>

53
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.922
<i>[Mom]</i>

54
00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:16.480
<i>[Mom]</i>

55
00:04:22.473 --> 00:04:24.403
I'm in despair.

56
00:04:24.403 --> 00:04:26.655
She called me a troublemaker.

57
00:04:26.655 --> 00:04:30.694
Not just reckless, but a troublemaker.

58
00:04:30.694 --> 00:04:33.468
How can she be so mistaken?

59
00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:39.372
This won't do. I need to fix this.

60
00:04:39.372 --> 00:04:42.643
I need to fix this terrible
misunderstanding between me and Joon.

61
00:04:42.643 --> 00:04:44.912
I have made a decision, my friend.

62
00:04:44.912 --> 00:04:47.153
- What decision?
- I'm going to go.

63
00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:53.316
I'll fix this confusing misunderstanding.

64
00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:56.415
Don't get involved, don't start trouble.

65
00:04:56.415 --> 00:05:00.787
Go back to the hotel
and stay there, you got it?

66
00:05:17.246 --> 00:05:21.460
No, I've finally met my destiny.

67
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.528
I can't let her think
I'm this reckless troublemaker.

68
00:05:24.528 --> 00:05:28.977
I must prove to her
that I'm not an evil person.

69
00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:46.417
<i>[Gangsu Distribution: Byun Gang Ho]</i>
As for our home shopping site...

70
00:05:46.417 --> 00:05:48.814
we're being inundated
with negative comments.

71
00:05:48.814 --> 00:05:52.150
Of course, sales have gone down
in our mart and department stores.

72
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.610
<i>[Gangsu Foreign Franchise: Byun Geum Hee]</i>
What's the point?

73
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.338
Everyone is already
talking about a boycott.

74
00:05:56.338 --> 00:05:59.735
<i>[Gangsu Food Director: Seol Ki Hwan]</i>
If there is a boycott...

75
00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:01.735
it will hurt Gangsu Food the most.

76
00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.941
<i>[Gangsu Food President & Group CEO:
Byun Gang Su]</i>

77
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:06.812
How are the stock prices?

78
00:06:07.953 --> 00:06:09.973
Of course, Gangsu Group's
stock has taken a hit.

79
00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:14.564
Distribution, foreign franchise, and
food have all gone down.

80
00:06:14.564 --> 00:06:18.787
We need to start focusing on morals
and family culture from now on, CEO.

81
00:06:18.787 --> 00:06:21.610
Why bother talking in circles?

82
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.013
Brother.

83
00:06:23.013 --> 00:06:25.884
Please discipline your son.

84
00:06:25.884 --> 00:06:28.230
Why must we all suffer
because of your son?

85
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.961
President Byun Geum Hee,
this is a professional setting.

86
00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:32.881
Please refrain from
inappropriate comments.

87
00:06:34.124 --> 00:06:37.453
How dare you lecture your aunt?

88
00:06:37.453 --> 00:06:40.461
Why don't you take better care of
your younger brother?

89
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.749
Don't act up with me.

90
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:45.391
Hey, hey. It's not the first time
Hyuk has caused trouble.

91
00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:47.612
Also, you should cut it out, Geum.

92
00:06:47.612 --> 00:06:49.420
How upset do you think
our older brother is?

93
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.347
How can I cut it out?

94
00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:53.230
Our stock values have
plummeted overnight.

95
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.840
Hey, is it just you? Is it just you?

96
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.280
Who was whining all morning?

97
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.307
Hey! You don't even own that much.

98
00:07:00.307 --> 00:07:02.095
What do you mean I don't own much?

99
00:07:10.687 --> 00:07:12.792
I asked to meet to come up with a plan.

100
00:07:12.792 --> 00:07:15.307
Did I ask to meet to have
an embarrassing family fight?

101
00:07:16.747 --> 00:07:19.158
Our stock prices are dropping.

102
00:07:19.158 --> 00:07:23.299
We'll need to come up with
some sort of countermeasure... a plan!

103
00:07:29.071 --> 00:07:31.201
I have a plan.

104
00:08:04.841 --> 00:08:06.249
He showed up.

105
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:09.429
- What?
- He showed up.

106
00:08:09.429 --> 00:08:11.749
The airplane disturbance, the second son.

107
00:08:17.312 --> 00:08:19.939
Plan? What plan?

108
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.240
What kind of plan could you have?

109
00:08:25.523 --> 00:08:26.730
I'll turn myself in.

110
00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:37.044
I'll turn myself in
and take my punishment.

111
00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:40.244
I'll make everything
that went wrong, right again.

112
00:08:40.244 --> 00:08:43.989
I'll explain the situation,
so that it doesn't hurt the company.

113
00:08:43.989 --> 00:08:46.379
I will explain it all.
Please leave it to me.

114
00:08:48.374 --> 00:08:50.135
Don't do it.

115
00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:51.154
Excuse me?

116
00:08:51.154 --> 00:08:53.851
I don't need you to turn
yourself in or anything.

117
00:08:55.355 --> 00:08:57.308
Just don't do a thing.

118
00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:00.062
But, Father...

119
00:09:05.157 --> 00:09:07.273
Who are you to explain anything?

120
00:09:07.273 --> 00:09:09.783
Who would believe anything you say?

121
00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:13.183
Don't say a single word
and don't do anything!

122
00:09:14.293 --> 00:09:17.812
Just do what I tell you to and
go shrivel up somewhere.

123
00:09:19.263 --> 00:09:21.196
Still, I caused the problem
and I should fix...

124
00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:22.364
You punk!

125
00:09:24.134 --> 00:09:27.072
That's right. You did cause the problem.

126
00:09:27.072 --> 00:09:30.984
The bigger problem is that it made
an issue for the whole company.

127
00:09:30.984 --> 00:09:34.544
All because of you,
our company's image was damaged.

128
00:09:34.544 --> 00:09:37.893
Do you know what kind
of loss that created?

129
00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:39.023
It's unfair for me too.

130
00:09:39.023 --> 00:09:40.385
Why, you little...

131
00:09:42.403 --> 00:09:46.092
Unfair? What could be unfair for you?

132
00:09:47.936 --> 00:09:51.556
You go around making trouble
without a single thought.

133
00:09:51.556 --> 00:09:53.635
What's unfair for you?

134
00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:55.504
You are the most useless punk.

135
00:09:55.504 --> 00:09:59.986
You are a punk who doesn't
know how to do anything!

<i>All wounds are similar to flowers
and the radiance of flowers.</i>

137

<i>The wounds that bleed...</i>

138
00:10:17.014 --> 00:10:19.176
<i>give off the fragrance of flowers.</i>

139
00:10:29.105 --> 00:10:32.370
<i>The heart of the person
pierced with the fragrance...</i>

140
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.894
<i>has a large wound.</i>

141
00:10:36.134 --> 00:10:40.825
<i>From that wound,
there was a fragrance of flowers.</i>

142
00:10:42.207 --> 00:10:45.205
Die, you punk! Die!

143
00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:46.946
You little rascal.

144
00:10:49.403 --> 00:10:50.980
I ought to just...

145
00:10:53.192 --> 00:10:54.432
CEO Byun!

146
00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:33.124
Hide him away well.

147
00:11:33.124 --> 00:11:36.412
Put a collar on him or put him in a box!

148
00:11:38.384 --> 00:11:40.773
Make sure he can't get out.

149
00:11:40.773 --> 00:11:42.893
Make sure no one can see him.

150
00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:56.611
Goodness!

151
00:11:56.611 --> 00:11:57.893
Oh, seriously.

152
00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:30.354
My friend... Mon ami.

153
00:12:32.061 --> 00:12:33.677
My friend.

154
00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:40.124
Can you get up?

155
00:12:42.057 --> 00:12:43.313
Ow.

156
00:12:44.307 --> 00:12:46.374
Oh, this is nothing.

157
00:12:50.884 --> 00:12:52.354
You know my father?

158
00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.436
His fists have gotten much weaker.

159
00:12:59.148 --> 00:13:00.682
Maybe that's why...

160
00:13:02.124 --> 00:13:03.542
he's using his feet now.

161
00:13:25.744 --> 00:13:26.955
Hello.

162
00:13:26.955 --> 00:13:29.485
- Hello.
- Hello.

163
00:13:29.485 --> 00:13:31.193
Good morning.

164
00:13:38.669 --> 00:13:41.244
Did he go to help that rich troublemaker?

165
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.966
<i>[Mom]</i>

166
00:14:03.664 --> 00:14:06.289
I told you to go to that hotel.
Why did you come here?

167
00:14:08.624 --> 00:14:12.970
I wanted to prove that I wasn't
just a reckless troublemaker.

168
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.283
Chief Byun is doing what he can
to stop you from going to prison.

169
00:14:17.283 --> 00:14:21.268
He wants to buy time as long as
he can and end it with probation.

170
00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.451
Hyuk.

171
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:31.893
There's a car waiting for you in
the parking garage, so go to the hotel.

172
00:14:31.893 --> 00:14:34.033
Don't get caught
by the reporters outside.

173
00:14:34.033 --> 00:14:35.311
In the end...

174
00:14:36.683 --> 00:14:39.371
am I someone who can't
do anything on my own?

175
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:43.879
Take this.

176
00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:46.173
They might track
your phone, so turn it off.

177
00:14:55.051 --> 00:14:56.124
Let's go.

178
00:15:01.047 --> 00:15:02.826
Get out, get out, get out.

179
00:15:02.826 --> 00:15:04.277
I told you to go!

180
00:15:04.277 --> 00:15:06.518
Hurry up and get out!

181
00:15:06.518 --> 00:15:09.028
I told you, it's good for hangovers.

182
00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:11.177
You said it was good for stamina before.

183
00:15:11.177 --> 00:15:13.379
It's good for stamina and hangovers.

184
00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:14.961
I don't want it either way.

185
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:17.566
I'm busy so get out. Go, go!

186
00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:21.431
If you don't want it, that's fine.
No need to be like this.

187
00:15:21.431 --> 00:15:24.192
Don't be this way.
Just try it for one month.

188
00:15:24.192 --> 00:15:26.706
I told you I don't want it.
Take it and get out!

189
00:15:26.706 --> 00:15:29.667
You drank all the free ones
I gave you to try last week.

190
00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:31.946
You enjoyed the free ones.

191
00:15:31.946 --> 00:15:34.239
Do you take me for a fool?

192
00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:37.836
Hey, Smoothie.
You forcefully gave them to me.

193
00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:40.633
Now, you're trying strong-arm me?

194
00:15:40.633 --> 00:15:42.052
- Section Chief.
- Seriously...

195
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:53.465
It's fine if you don't want it.

196
00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:56.321
How could you throw it all on the ground?

197
00:15:56.321 --> 00:15:57.750
These are for drinking.

198
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.263
Hey, Manager Kim! Call security.

199
00:16:00.263 --> 00:16:02.452
Get this woman out of here now.

200
00:16:02.452 --> 00:16:04.153
This is so annoying,
early in the morning.

201
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:13.101
Ah, don't let it get to you.

202
00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:15.696
Don't let it get to you, Baek Joon.

203
00:16:19.047 --> 00:16:20.206
Hey, Hyuk.

204
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.508
What do I with these?

205
00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:32.735
Oh, thank you.

206
00:16:39.068 --> 00:16:41.355
Oh, Hyuk!

207
00:16:41.355 --> 00:16:45.182
How... what are you doing here?

208
00:16:45.182 --> 00:16:46.340
Wait.

209
00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:52.068
Hey... huh?

210
00:16:52.068 --> 00:16:53.191
Oh...

211
00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:12.208
Gosh, seriously... who are you?

212
00:17:15.214 --> 00:17:16.505
Oh!

213
00:17:16.505 --> 00:17:19.734
Yes, that's right. Oh... it's me.

214
00:17:19.734 --> 00:17:22.604
How... how did you end up here?

215
00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:26.113
You don't need to know that.
Why don't you just drink it?

216
00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:27.783
How much could it cost in a month?

217
00:17:27.783 --> 00:17:32.981
For a person trying to make a living
and smiling while doing it...

218
00:17:32.981 --> 00:17:35.183
there's nothing
more important than health.

219
00:17:35.183 --> 00:17:38.340
Yes, yes! Ah, yes.

220
00:17:39.904 --> 00:17:42.204
If you really don't have
the money for it...

221
00:17:42.204 --> 00:17:44.840
talk to your team manager,
Kwon, about it.

222
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.136
Yes, I understand.

223
00:17:48.136 --> 00:17:50.598
I'm sorry, Section Chief.

224
00:17:50.598 --> 00:17:53.273
Are you crazy? Let's go.

225
00:17:53.273 --> 00:17:54.754
I'm sorry.

226
00:17:54.754 --> 00:17:56.707
Joon!

227
00:17:56.707 --> 00:18:00.173
Hey, you! You, you... hey.

228
00:18:06.574 --> 00:18:11.434
<i>[CEO's troublemaker son,
Byun Hyuk, is in the office.]</i>

229
00:18:12.568 --> 00:18:14.171
<i>[CEO's troublemaker son,
Byun Hyuk, is in the office.]</i>

230
00:18:17.199 --> 00:18:20.513
Please don't post things like this
online, Section Chief Gong.

231
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:24.081
The company atmosphere
is already quite hectic.

232
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:39.289
What are you doing?

233
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:42.229
We're trying to make sales,
not force them into it.

234
00:18:42.229 --> 00:18:43.490
What do you mean force?

235
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.724
I was only trying to make him
understand as a human being.

236
00:18:46.724 --> 00:18:48.705
It looked like you were pressuring him.

237
00:18:48.705 --> 00:18:51.943
Anyway, that's not how you do sales.

238
00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:57.998
Hey... what's wrong with your face?

239
00:18:57.998 --> 00:19:00.150
- Did you get hit?
- Yeah.

240
00:19:03.293 --> 00:19:04.465
Just a bit.

241
00:19:04.465 --> 00:19:06.680
Tell me the truth.

242
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.238
Why did you come here?

243
00:19:10.869 --> 00:19:12.475
The thing about that is, Joon...

244
00:19:12.475 --> 00:19:16.697
To tell you the truth,
my father works here.

245
00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:18.472
Where? Which department?

246
00:19:18.472 --> 00:19:22.407
Not any department in particular,
but the entire company really.

247
00:19:22.407 --> 00:19:25.313
- Is he a laborer?
- Huh?

248
00:19:25.313 --> 00:19:28.490
Like janitorial or security?

249
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.166
- Security?
- Oh...

250
00:19:30.166 --> 00:19:32.507
So, he works in security.

251
00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:39.150
If you came to see your father,
why did you get hit like that?

252
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.163
Oh, because of what happened yesterday...

253
00:19:42.163 --> 00:19:44.860
He got very angry because you got
fired from the hotel, right?

254
00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.541
- Huh?
- I see.

255
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:49.111
It's not easy to get a job
like that these days.

256
00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:53.562
From your father's point of view,
I'm sure he's disappointed.

257
00:19:53.562 --> 00:19:57.361
How angry was he that he hit
his son's face like this?

258
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.654
Well... I'm always the son
who disappoints him.

259
00:20:13.101 --> 00:20:14.769
Yes?

260
00:20:14.769 --> 00:20:16.810
You should get back to the hotel.

261
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.875
All right.

262
00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:19.953
I will.

263
00:20:29.443 --> 00:20:31.747
I should get going.

264
00:20:31.747 --> 00:20:32.988
Thanks, Joon.

265
00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:39.598
- Hold on for now.
- What?

266
00:20:40.777 --> 00:20:43.244
The police might come around.

267
00:20:43.244 --> 00:20:45.538
It will be investigated
confidentially, so don't worry.

268
00:20:45.538 --> 00:20:47.850
I've already talked it over with them.

269
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:52.650
By any chance... was this planned
by the prosecutor's office?

270
00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.710
We would be in trouble
if this came out too.

271
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.031
Listen carefully.

272
00:20:59.031 --> 00:21:02.023
Since the media knows about it,
we need to make it look good.

273
00:21:02.023 --> 00:21:04.540
If the police find a case there,
it will have credibility.

274
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.985
It will depend, but there
could be an official investigation.

275
00:21:06.985 --> 00:21:09.589
You have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

276
00:21:13.473 --> 00:21:14.763
You have him, right?

277
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.570
Hide him well, so he doesn't get caught.

278
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.242
We can't control it if he shows up.

279
00:21:21.242 --> 00:21:24.238
Gangsu Group is not
the problem. We will be dead.

280
00:21:24.238 --> 00:21:26.284
That's why it's not us, kid.

281
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.579
Then I'll assume that's true
and get going.

282
00:21:32.579 --> 00:21:34.990
In my experience...

283
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.209
these things are usually
from someone on the inside.

284
00:21:40.123 --> 00:21:42.358
Enemies are usually someone close by.

285
00:21:53.431 --> 00:21:56.871
Someone on the inside? What do you mean?

286
00:21:56.871 --> 00:22:01.714
Do you still have that
original file that I gave you?

287
00:22:01.714 --> 00:22:06.449
Of course, I put it in my safe
right after you gave it to me.

288
00:22:06.449 --> 00:22:08.698
I'm certain about it so don't worry.

289
00:22:08.698 --> 00:22:11.149
You should make sure that
that flight attendant stays quiet.

290
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:15.231
It will really be a pain if she starts
giving interviews, crying and so on.

291
00:22:16.223 --> 00:22:17.402
I understand.

292
00:22:19.202 --> 00:22:22.063
Where is Hyuk now anyway?

293
00:22:25.614 --> 00:22:28.444
He's probably at the hotel.

294
00:22:35.666 --> 00:22:38.592
That's the new place
they're building. You see it?

295
00:22:38.592 --> 00:22:41.632
Today's the first day,
so they'll be carrying bricks.

296
00:22:41.632 --> 00:22:42.842
There's lots to do.

297
00:22:42.842 --> 00:22:44.396
- Don't worry. Let's go.
- Joon.

298
00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:46.127
- Oh, you're here.
- Joon!

299
00:22:46.127 --> 00:22:48.217
- Is this him?
- Yes.

300
00:22:48.217 --> 00:22:50.868
This is my friend, Byun Hyuk.

301
00:22:50.868 --> 00:22:53.883
He's going through a difficult time.
Please help him out.

302
00:22:53.883 --> 00:22:56.069
Joon, I don't know about this...

303
00:23:00.558 --> 00:23:02.954
He's a little soft. Will he be okay?

304
00:23:02.954 --> 00:23:05.507
What do you mean soft? It's all muscle.

305
00:23:08.567 --> 00:23:12.028
I know he's soft,
but he's got a lot of spirit.

306
00:23:12.028 --> 00:23:14.538
Please teach him well, okay?

307
00:23:14.538 --> 00:23:19.185
- Joon, must I do this?
- All right, since it's you asking.

308
00:23:19.185 --> 00:23:22.275
Hey, get over here Byun.

309
00:23:22.275 --> 00:23:24.044
What do you mean Byun?

310
00:23:24.044 --> 00:23:27.336
Yeah, what is that? Byun?

311
00:23:27.336 --> 00:23:29.836
Mister Byun, follow us.

312
00:23:31.989 --> 00:23:34.675
- Byun...
- Joon!

313
00:23:34.675 --> 00:23:36.197
You can make 90,000 won a day.

314
00:23:36.197 --> 00:23:38.185
It's hard to find a job like this.

315
00:23:38.185 --> 00:23:40.384
Don't complain, just learn the job.

316
00:23:40.384 --> 00:23:41.594
See you later.

317
00:23:45.406 --> 00:23:46.462
Joon!

318
00:23:47.675 --> 00:23:50.384
Why are you standing there?
Go work to earn your meal.

319
00:23:50.384 --> 00:23:52.344
Ma'am!

320
00:23:52.344 --> 00:23:53.904
Hurry.

321
00:23:53.904 --> 00:23:56.614
Hurry, hurry. Get going.

322
00:23:58.968 --> 00:24:02.093
You need to put more in there.

323
00:24:02.093 --> 00:24:03.384
Put more.

324
00:24:05.955 --> 00:24:07.111
Get going.

325
00:24:08.324 --> 00:24:11.062
All right. Let's go.

326
00:24:11.062 --> 00:24:13.442
You... you want me to carry this?

327
00:24:13.442 --> 00:24:15.109
Who else would do it?

328
00:24:15.109 --> 00:24:17.192
What are you doing? Hurry up.

329
00:24:18.492 --> 00:24:20.022
Okay. Go.

330
00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:24.175
All right. Go!

331
00:24:24.175 --> 00:24:25.504
Oh, oh. Wait.

332
00:24:25.504 --> 00:24:28.935
All right. Let's go!

333
00:24:30.738 --> 00:24:33.557
Mister Byun, hurry it up.

334
00:24:33.557 --> 00:24:34.904
Ouch.

335
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.296
Hey, Byun. Get over here.

336
00:24:47.296 --> 00:24:48.335
I can't do it.

337
00:24:48.335 --> 00:24:49.581
What do you mean you can't?

338
00:24:49.581 --> 00:24:51.025
Byun Hyuk!

339
00:24:52.182 --> 00:24:54.365
Keep it up!

340
00:24:54.365 --> 00:24:56.057
Stay strong! Woohoo!

341
00:24:56.944 --> 00:24:58.086
Woo!

342
00:25:03.092 --> 00:25:05.743
Ah... I think I'm going crazy.

343
00:25:11.654 --> 00:25:12.775
Hello.

344
00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:17.454
Where are you?
Are you at the hotel?

345
00:25:17.454 --> 00:25:19.216
Jae Hoon, please save me.

346
00:25:19.216 --> 00:25:22.134
- What are you talking about?
- This is hell.

347
00:25:22.134 --> 00:25:25.029
I followed Joon and now I'm
trapped in a part-time job.

348
00:25:26.092 --> 00:25:28.149
What? Who did you follow?

349
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:30.477
Why would you follow Joon?

350
00:25:30.477 --> 00:25:33.457
Please, Jae Hoon. Please save me.

351
00:25:33.457 --> 00:25:35.331
I'm scared and hungry.

352
00:25:35.331 --> 00:25:38.064
You rascal.

353
00:25:38.064 --> 00:25:40.173
Why are you hitting me?

354
00:25:40.173 --> 00:25:42.464
Hello... hello?

355
00:25:48.535 --> 00:25:50.362
He's not picking up.

356
00:25:54.427 --> 00:25:57.454
<i>This caller cannot take your call.</i>

357
00:26:01.358 --> 00:26:03.766
Hey, this is your life around here.

358
00:26:03.766 --> 00:26:05.478
You can't just take it off like that.

359
00:26:05.478 --> 00:26:06.836
Put it back on now.

360
00:26:06.836 --> 00:26:08.884
Why are you doing this to me, Mister?

361
00:26:08.884 --> 00:26:12.105
Why do you think?
I'm taking care of Joon's friend.

362
00:26:12.105 --> 00:26:14.312
You fool around every chance you get.

363
00:26:14.312 --> 00:26:15.440
Where's Joon?

364
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.131
Where do you think?
She's working hard.

365
00:26:25.454 --> 00:26:27.354
<i>Oh my goodness.</i>

366
00:26:27.354 --> 00:26:29.194
<i>That enchanting figure.</i>

367
00:26:29.194 --> 00:26:31.602
<i>Every movement filled with passion.</i>

368
00:26:31.602 --> 00:26:34.763
<i>A natural grace waiting to explode.</i>

369
00:26:34.763 --> 00:26:36.454
<i>Oh, Joon.</i>

370
00:26:36.454 --> 00:26:38.705
<i>You are beautiful
no matter what you are doing.</i>

371
00:26:41.425 --> 00:26:45.025
Hey, hey, hey.
You're drooling.

372
00:26:45.025 --> 00:26:47.485
Wipe your drool and follow me.

373
00:26:47.485 --> 00:26:49.407
What are you doing?

374
00:26:49.407 --> 00:26:51.226
Have you seen the news?

375
00:26:51.226 --> 00:26:52.977
I came because of the video leak.

376
00:26:52.977 --> 00:26:54.114
Are you...

377
00:26:55.935 --> 00:26:57.927
suspicious of me right now?

378
00:26:57.927 --> 00:27:00.267
You just saw me get off the plane.

379
00:27:00.267 --> 00:27:01.736
I wasn't even in the country.

380
00:27:01.736 --> 00:27:04.365
You could've given it to someone else.

381
00:27:04.365 --> 00:27:08.378
You really are just too much.

382
00:27:08.378 --> 00:27:10.172
I'm the victim.

383
00:27:10.172 --> 00:27:14.066
You people didn't take care of it and
now you're coming to threaten the victim?

384
00:27:14.066 --> 00:27:17.326
I hope you understand why I would
have to come talk to you.

385
00:27:17.326 --> 00:27:19.098
I'm doing my best to forget it.

386
00:27:21.156 --> 00:27:24.246
If you continue to come
looking for me regarding this...

387
00:27:24.246 --> 00:27:27.826
I might forget about this settlement.

388
00:27:27.826 --> 00:27:31.408
I hope I don't need to see
your face in the future.

389
00:27:33.637 --> 00:27:36.037
Someone from the media might contact you.

390
00:27:43.659 --> 00:27:46.065
Don't ever agree to an interview.

391
00:27:46.065 --> 00:27:50.188
Keep this a secret from your co-workers
and the people around you.

392
00:27:50.188 --> 00:27:54.609
If you break the contract,
we can breach this settlement, as well.

393
00:27:54.609 --> 00:27:55.637
Goodbye.

394
00:28:12.755 --> 00:28:13.958
Good job.

395
00:28:15.737 --> 00:28:18.007
Good job, young man.

396
00:28:18.007 --> 00:28:19.182
Good work.

397
00:28:20.277 --> 00:28:22.580
You should put some
muscle-healing pads on him.

398
00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.307
You're the one who suffered, Mister.

399
00:28:24.307 --> 00:28:26.214
Yeah, I guess.

400
00:28:26.214 --> 00:28:28.821
Hey, you're a young man.

401
00:28:28.821 --> 00:28:31.983
You need more strength.

402
00:28:31.983 --> 00:28:33.671
- Goodbye.
- Yeah.

403
00:28:41.583 --> 00:28:44.899
Ta-da! Today's pay, 90,000 won.

404
00:28:47.665 --> 00:28:50.712
10,000 won is for the lunch
you had earlier.

405
00:28:50.712 --> 00:28:53.495
20,000 won is for the shovel
you broke today.

406
00:28:53.495 --> 00:28:56.592
For the ramen yesterday, I'll give you
a discount since you suffered.

407
00:28:56.592 --> 00:29:01.394
Breakfast was 4,500 won, and tomorrow's
breakfast will be 20,000 won.

408
00:29:01.394 --> 00:29:02.969
Here. Good work.

409
00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:12.762
40,000 won.

410
00:29:14.592 --> 00:29:16.312
Just to earn this...

411
00:29:42.108 --> 00:29:44.160
You don't need to call your dad?

412
00:29:45.698 --> 00:29:49.548
He must feel bad
after hitting you like that.

413
00:29:49.548 --> 00:29:51.606
I told you.

414
00:29:51.606 --> 00:29:55.609
No news is good news
when it comes to me and my father.

415
00:29:55.609 --> 00:29:58.345
I don't know what the issue is.

416
00:29:58.345 --> 00:30:00.969
You should still be good
to him while he's around.

417
00:30:00.969 --> 00:30:02.986
It'll be too late once he passes away.

418
00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.925
What was your father like?

419
00:30:09.006 --> 00:30:10.095
My dad?

420
00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.755
He was a normal man.

421
00:30:18.685 --> 00:30:22.125
He was kind and warm.

422
00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:25.727
He was loving and sensitive.

423
00:30:25.727 --> 00:30:28.110
So, my mom found him
a little bit frustrating.

424
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.897
He was the best dad to me.

425
00:30:31.566 --> 00:30:33.719
If I think about it now...

426
00:30:33.719 --> 00:30:37.051
I think he got hurt by the world
a lot because he had so much love.

427
00:30:41.768 --> 00:30:43.910
- So, I...
- Wait, stop!

428
00:30:45.242 --> 00:30:46.359
What is it?

429
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:52.340
You were about step on
the dandelion seed flower.

430
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.669
Wait.

431
00:30:55.069 --> 00:30:57.718
Here we go.

432
00:31:36.711 --> 00:31:40.609
Whenever I see the dandelion seeds,
I want to let them fly.

433
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:46.269
It's like a wounded soul
is flying free somewhere.

434
00:31:47.971 --> 00:31:52.310
If they can find root
somewhere new and live there...

435
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.979
they can forget their past bad memories.

436
00:32:24.393 --> 00:32:25.742
Oh, Jae Hoon.

437
00:32:25.742 --> 00:32:28.362
Oh, my friend Jae Hoon.

438
00:32:30.042 --> 00:32:33.189
I guess he's coming home from work.

439
00:32:36.369 --> 00:32:39.239
What are you doing here?
You didn't go home?

440
00:32:39.239 --> 00:32:41.898
Oh, the thing is...

441
00:32:41.898 --> 00:32:45.739
He started working a job
with me today. 90,000 won a day.

442
00:32:45.739 --> 00:32:47.939
Yes, 90,000 won a day.

443
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.219
So, that's why I want to ask...

444
00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:55.069
can he stay with you
until he gets his own place?

445
00:32:55.069 --> 00:32:56.848
Can I, Jae Hoon, my friend?

446
00:32:56.848 --> 00:33:00.228
No, just go back to where you belong.

447
00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:04.169
If you don't want to,
then he can stay at my place.

448
00:33:04.169 --> 00:33:05.813
- Really?
- Are you crazy?

449
00:33:05.813 --> 00:33:08.561
I can go sleep downstairs at my
friend's place on the third floor.

450
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:12.420
But, it'll be 15,000 won a night.
What do you think?

451
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.225
I'll pay for two nights.

452
00:33:19.771 --> 00:33:21.890
Sounds good.

453
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.772
That's good.

454
00:33:23.772 --> 00:33:25.314
Let's go, Joon.

455
00:33:25.314 --> 00:33:26.709
Let's go!

456
00:33:29.377 --> 00:33:31.815
What? I paid already.

457
00:33:31.815 --> 00:33:34.965
What is your problem?
I'm going up to Joon's to sleep.

458
00:33:34.965 --> 00:33:36.887
I paid 30,000 won.

459
00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040
Geez.

460
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.852
Be quiet. Shut your mouth
and and go to bed here.

461
00:33:41.852 --> 00:33:44.271
Joon... Joon!

462
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:45.960
- Joon!
- Hey.

463
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.871
What? What? My 30,000 won.

464
00:33:51.589 --> 00:33:53.233
My 30,000 won.

465
00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.336
Joon.

466
00:33:56.429 --> 00:33:58.510
Joon!

467
00:34:08.053 --> 00:34:10.489
<i>[Mom]</i>

468
00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:14.089

469
00:34:17.297 --> 00:34:18.681

471
00:35:09.732 --> 00:35:10.857
Oh my.

472
00:35:13.027 --> 00:35:14.420
Oh, you scared me.

473
00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:18.357
What is this? Ha Yeon Hee.

474
00:35:21.457 --> 00:35:22.605
It's me.

475
00:35:23.547 --> 00:35:25.672
Look at you just drinking
soju with no food.

476
00:35:26.817 --> 00:35:29.196
You should've called if you were here.

477
00:35:29.196 --> 00:35:30.960
It's not right of you
to drink without me.

478
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.616
I wouldn't do that.

479
00:35:33.616 --> 00:35:36.857
This one is for our pretty Joon.

480
00:35:36.857 --> 00:35:38.882
Thank you very much.

481
00:35:40.408 --> 00:35:42.620
What is it? Something's wrong, huh?

482
00:35:43.696 --> 00:35:44.766
Joon.

483
00:35:46.245 --> 00:35:47.875
Have you seen the news?

484
00:35:48.757 --> 00:35:51.948
Third generation rich guy,
airplane disturbance.

485
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:55.544
It can't be...

486
00:35:55.544 --> 00:35:58.199
That flight attendant
whose face is blurred out.

487
00:35:58.199 --> 00:36:00.462
That person is...

488
00:36:02.486 --> 00:36:03.728
me.

489
00:36:06.877 --> 00:36:08.368
What... what?

490
00:36:12.853 --> 00:36:14.198
My friend.

491
00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:17.009
You see this money here?

492
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:23.161
It's the first money I earned
shedding blood and tears.

493
00:36:24.969 --> 00:36:28.966
I don't think I'll ever
be able to spend this.

494
00:36:30.149 --> 00:36:31.471
My lucky 10,000 won.

495
00:36:33.252 --> 00:36:35.245
I'll save it as a keepsake.

496
00:36:36.303 --> 00:36:39.281
Go ahead and do that.

497
00:36:39.281 --> 00:36:42.649
You won't ever have to do
hard labor to make money again.

498
00:36:43.799 --> 00:36:45.158
Do you know?

499
00:36:45.158 --> 00:36:50.928
Most people can't keep money
as a keepsake after earning it.

500
00:36:50.928 --> 00:36:54.435
They need to eat when they're hungry
and they need shelter to rest in.

501
00:36:54.435 --> 00:36:57.277
A life where income
and spending is equal.

502
00:37:02.545 --> 00:37:05.165
Yes! Hell Joseon.

503
00:37:05.165 --> 00:37:09.957
I feel like Neo,
who just took the red pill.

504
00:37:09.957 --> 00:37:12.116
What are you saying?

505
00:37:12.116 --> 00:37:15.045
The matrix I've been living in
has been shattered.

506
00:37:15.045 --> 00:37:19.734
The woman who gave me the drug
showing me the truth is my destiny.

507
00:37:19.734 --> 00:37:22.797
I really can't just go to sleep.

508
00:37:22.797 --> 00:37:24.464
I need to go have a drink with Joon.

509
00:37:24.464 --> 00:37:26.846
Can I buy some pork belly
with 10,000 won?

510
00:37:26.846 --> 00:37:28.216
No. Just sleep.

511
00:37:28.216 --> 00:37:29.574
Look here, friend.

512
00:37:29.574 --> 00:37:33.018
99 percent of you
is a very excellent friend.

513
00:37:33.018 --> 00:37:35.359
However, the one percent
bad part is so strong.

514
00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:37.761
You're so stubborn and hard-headed.

515
00:37:37.761 --> 00:37:39.216
Give it a rest and sleep.

516
00:37:39.216 --> 00:37:40.848
Don't stop me, friend.

517
00:37:40.848 --> 00:37:43.020
Just one drink, Joon.

518
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.120
Joon!

519
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.058
Hey, stop right there.

520
00:37:49.415 --> 00:37:51.312
<i>[Settlement - Kwon Jae Hoon]</i>

521
00:37:51.312 --> 00:37:54.074
You know, I really...

522
00:37:54.074 --> 00:37:57.033
didn't want to sign
this kind of contract.

523
00:37:58.484 --> 00:38:02.243
But, all the higher-up people
ended up settling.

524
00:38:02.243 --> 00:38:06.544
They were all just
telling me to do as I was told.

525
00:38:09.143 --> 00:38:11.632
You're telling me it was
this guy, Kwon Jae Hoon?

526
00:38:11.632 --> 00:38:14.283
The thin guy who looks
like this, Kwon Jae Hoon?

527
00:38:14.283 --> 00:38:17.181
Yes and it was fine up until there.

528
00:38:17.181 --> 00:38:20.701
Then he showed up
today and threatened me.

529
00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:25.792
He asked me if it I was
the one who leaked the video.

530
00:38:25.792 --> 00:38:28.029
This jerk is trash!

531
00:38:28.029 --> 00:38:29.728
Does that make sense?

532
00:38:29.728 --> 00:38:34.884
Who would leak a video of herself
getting sexually harassed?

533
00:38:34.884 --> 00:38:36.814
What kind of psycho would do that?

534
00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:38.582
No one would do that.

535
00:38:38.582 --> 00:38:42.176
I... I... will go and kill him.

536
00:38:43.607 --> 00:38:45.833
Joon! Joon!

537
00:38:46.884 --> 00:38:48.062
Joon!

538
00:38:49.743 --> 00:38:51.268
Let's have a drink.

539
00:38:51.268 --> 00:38:52.518
Hyuk, I...

540
00:39:45.281 --> 00:39:46.560
You punk!

541
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.426
No, this is all a misunderstanding.

542
00:39:52.152 --> 00:39:53.975
Why did you do that? Why there?

543
00:39:53.975 --> 00:39:55.100
You!

544
00:39:56.759 --> 00:39:59.940
You... you...

545
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.221
- You...
- What is it, Yeon Hee?

546
00:40:03.221 --> 00:40:05.042
This is the guy.

547
00:40:05.042 --> 00:40:06.067
Huh?

548
00:40:06.067 --> 00:40:08.121
This is that jerk!

549
00:40:08.121 --> 00:40:10.864
That reckless trouble-making
third generation son of Gangsu.

550
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:17.620
<i>[Third generation son of Gangsu]</i>

551
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.690
<i>[Third generation son of Gangsu]</i>

552
00:40:21.341 --> 00:40:25.131
No! I'm not him.

553
00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:27.971
Jae Hoon, tell her I'm not him.

554
00:40:27.971 --> 00:40:30.900
You're not him? You're not?

555
00:40:32.591 --> 00:40:33.741
You're not?

556
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:39.790
You're really that
third generation son of the Gangsu?

557
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:41.862
No, no. Joon, I'm not.

558
00:40:41.862 --> 00:40:46.321
It is him.

559
00:40:46.321 --> 00:40:50.359
It is him. I'm right.

560
00:40:50.359 --> 00:40:53.933
It's all a misunderstanding,
Joon. It really is.

561
00:40:53.933 --> 00:40:58.245
Shut your mouth,
you dandelion bastard jerk!

562
00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.433
Oh my goodness!

563
00:41:15.373 --> 00:41:18.073
Oh, Hyuk.

564
00:41:18.073 --> 00:41:19.415
What is it?

565
00:41:20.736 --> 00:41:23.777
Honey, our Hyuk...

566
00:41:23.777 --> 00:41:25.475
In my dream, Hyuk...

567
00:41:25.475 --> 00:41:27.806
It was just a crazy dream.

568
00:41:27.806 --> 00:41:29.216
Go back to sleep.

569
00:41:30.774 --> 00:41:32.975
This won't do.

570
00:41:32.975 --> 00:41:36.299
I need to go to see my spiritual guide
and ask him to look after Hyuk.

571
00:41:36.299 --> 00:41:39.728
I told you not to bring him up.

572
00:41:45.339 --> 00:41:46.399
Kwon Jae Hoon.

573
00:41:47.323 --> 00:41:50.183
Is this the son of that CEO you work for?

574
00:41:51.362 --> 00:41:52.746
Joon.

575
00:41:52.746 --> 00:41:54.096
Tell me now.

576
00:41:55.415 --> 00:41:56.915
That's right.

577
00:41:56.915 --> 00:41:59.765
Hyuk is that Byun Hyuk.

578
00:42:01.935 --> 00:42:04.946
So, you two planned it to fool me.

579
00:42:04.946 --> 00:42:08.234
We never planned it
or tried to fool you, Joon.

580
00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:10.149
"Nice to meet you."

581
00:42:10.149 --> 00:42:12.580
You used formal speech
to each other in front of me.

582
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.275
That's not planning?

583
00:42:14.275 --> 00:42:17.386
Don't get upset. Calm down, Joon.

584
00:42:17.386 --> 00:42:20.844
This all started from a small
misunderstanding.

585
00:42:20.844 --> 00:42:24.205
It was when you thought
I was a hotel employee.

586
00:42:24.205 --> 00:42:27.955
Right, you've been
lying to me since then.

587
00:42:27.955 --> 00:42:31.384
You pretended to be a poor
hotel employee who got fired.

588
00:42:31.384 --> 00:42:34.516
Yeah, did you have fun
playing me like that?

589
00:42:34.516 --> 00:42:36.094
Did you have fun?

590
00:42:36.094 --> 00:42:39.705
All I did was let him
sleep over when you brought him over.

591
00:42:39.705 --> 00:42:42.315
What did you two say when we
watched the news together?

592
00:42:42.315 --> 00:42:45.634
- That's because...
- That's because...

593
00:42:45.634 --> 00:42:48.643
You were criticizing me
so much after watching the news.

594
00:42:48.643 --> 00:42:50.315
Criticizing?

595
00:42:50.315 --> 00:42:53.431
You said I was a reckless troublemaker
and evil that needed to be erased.

596
00:42:53.431 --> 00:42:55.123
Well, aren't you?

597
00:42:55.123 --> 00:42:56.708
I'm not that bad, Joon.

598
00:42:56.708 --> 00:42:58.364
I'm not that reckless of a troublemaker.

599
00:43:02.114 --> 00:43:05.018
You're all dead now.

600
00:43:05.018 --> 00:43:07.788
I don't think I can stand by any longer.

601
00:43:07.788 --> 00:43:11.228
Hey... what kind of people are you?

602
00:43:11.228 --> 00:43:13.294
Yeon Hee, why don't you put this down?

603
00:43:13.294 --> 00:43:14.328
Move.

604
00:43:14.328 --> 00:43:16.330
Yes, you could hurt yourself.

605
00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:17.631
Please calm down.

606
00:43:17.631 --> 00:43:19.926
I'm already hurt!

607
00:43:19.926 --> 00:43:21.837
Forget it.
Both of you, get on your knees.

608
00:43:21.837 --> 00:43:22.855
- What?
- What?

609
00:43:22.855 --> 00:43:25.522
Get on your knees and apologize.

610
00:43:25.522 --> 00:43:27.719
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

611
00:43:27.719 --> 00:43:29.779
Why should I?

612
00:43:29.779 --> 00:43:32.678
I didn't do anything wrong,
so why should I?

613
00:43:32.678 --> 00:43:34.984
We should save people's lives first.

614
00:43:34.984 --> 00:43:37.094
The person who was wrong apologized.

615
00:43:37.094 --> 00:43:39.978
All I did was write the settlement
on behalf of another person.

616
00:43:39.978 --> 00:43:42.866
You just did what
you were told, is that it?

617
00:43:48.766 --> 00:43:49.966
Yeon Hee!

618
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.067
You can keep this piece of paper.

619
00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:59.228
You took the settlement money.
You can't act this way.

620
00:43:59.228 --> 00:44:01.183
Hey! Hey!

621
00:44:07.672 --> 00:44:11.433
Take all your money too.
I don't need any of it.

622
00:44:11.433 --> 00:44:13.569
Take it back. Take it all back.

623
00:44:13.569 --> 00:44:15.406
You bastards!

624
00:44:15.406 --> 00:44:18.326
You should never have accepted it.
Why are you causing a fuss now?

625
00:44:18.326 --> 00:44:20.435
Kwon Jae Hoon, shut your mouth now.

626
00:44:26.685 --> 00:44:28.998
You punks. I'll call the police now.

627
00:44:28.998 --> 00:44:30.491
- Joon.
- Do what you want.

628
00:44:30.491 --> 00:44:34.785
- Jae Hoon.
- You'll have to be investigated too.

629
00:44:34.785 --> 00:44:37.899
- Why?
- You'll have to explain why he was here.

630
00:44:37.899 --> 00:44:39.705
I didn't know who he was.

631
00:44:39.705 --> 00:44:41.158
You two lied to me.

632
00:44:41.158 --> 00:44:43.007
That's not what I'll say.

633
00:44:43.007 --> 00:44:47.377
I'll say you knew from the beginning,
hid him, and you're an accomplice.

634
00:44:47.377 --> 00:44:49.957
That's all I need to say.

635
00:44:49.957 --> 00:44:52.710
Wow, Kwon Jae Hoon. You're really petty.

636
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.388
He accidentally touched her
and she got 10 million won.

637
00:44:56.388 --> 00:44:58.422
Why would I get on my knees?

638
00:44:58.422 --> 00:45:01.710
Hey, are you done
talking now? Stop right there!

639
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.960
Jae Hoon!

640
00:45:11.781 --> 00:45:13.890
Yeon Hee... Yeon Hee.

641
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:17.922
Are you okay? What do I do?

642
00:45:17.922 --> 00:45:19.917
What should we do?

643
00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:20.953
Should I carry her?

644
00:45:20.953 --> 00:45:23.873
Get lost, you pervert!

645
00:45:23.873 --> 00:45:25.679
Get out of here.

646
00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:28.002
- Yeon Hee.
- Pervert?

647
00:45:31.719 --> 00:45:33.341
Hey, friend.

648
00:45:35.723 --> 00:45:37.746
No matter what...

649
00:45:37.746 --> 00:45:41.926
weren't you going too far,
provoking Joon like that?

650
00:45:41.926 --> 00:45:45.775
What if Joon still goes to the police?

651
00:45:48.007 --> 00:45:49.516
It's okay if they take me in.

652
00:45:49.516 --> 00:45:53.223
If I get arrested,
won't you be in trouble at work?

653
00:45:55.467 --> 00:45:59.636
Even if there is trouble for me,
all they can do is discipline or fire me.

654
00:45:59.636 --> 00:46:02.498
Jae Hoon, you don't mean that.

655
00:46:02.498 --> 00:46:04.495
I do mean it.

656
00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:09.792
All the trouble you cause, everything
you do wrong, even when you breathe...

657
00:46:09.792 --> 00:46:12.364
I have to take
responsibility for all of it.

658
00:46:12.364 --> 00:46:14.194
I am so sick and tired of it.

659
00:46:16.495 --> 00:46:21.006
Now, I want to see what my life
would be like without you.

660
00:46:42.895 --> 00:46:44.047
Jae Hoon.

661
00:46:46.002 --> 00:46:49.152
I know I've put you through a lot.

662
00:46:50.506 --> 00:46:53.150
Still, we have to stick together
through the hard times.

663
00:46:54.777 --> 00:46:57.388
What am I supposed to do by myself?

664
00:46:57.388 --> 00:46:58.435
Okay?

665
00:47:09.283 --> 00:47:10.437
This is yours.

666
00:47:16.886 --> 00:47:19.216
This is so absurd. It really is.

667
00:47:22.286 --> 00:47:25.076
One is a pervert.

668
00:47:25.076 --> 00:47:29.551
The other is a jerk
with no tears or blood.

669
00:47:29.551 --> 00:47:32.645
Those are my friends?

670
00:47:32.645 --> 00:47:33.855
Friends?

671
00:47:33.855 --> 00:47:36.051
They aren't my friends.

672
00:47:42.027 --> 00:47:44.053
Those bastards!

673
00:47:52.518 --> 00:47:53.609
Joon.

674
00:47:54.897 --> 00:47:57.743
I didn't mean to lie to you.

675
00:47:57.743 --> 00:48:02.098
You said I was a reckless,
evil, troublemaker.

676
00:48:02.098 --> 00:48:05.118
I lost my chance to tell you
who I really was. I'm really sorry.

677
00:48:08.578 --> 00:48:12.036
Yes, I know it's all my fault.

678
00:48:12.036 --> 00:48:14.928
I'll accept all the blame.

679
00:48:14.928 --> 00:48:19.728
One thing I really want to correct
is that you think I'm a pervert.

680
00:48:19.728 --> 00:48:23.058
You saw earlier that I
slipped on the soju bottle.

681
00:48:23.058 --> 00:48:27.288
The airplane incident
was because of turbulence too.

682
00:48:27.288 --> 00:48:30.245
How dare you give me your cheap excuses?

683
00:48:30.245 --> 00:48:32.591
It's not an excuse. It's a fact.

684
00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:34.908
If you want to apologize,
do it to Yeon Hee.

685
00:48:34.908 --> 00:48:37.109
Until you do,
you'll forever be a pervert to me.

686
00:48:39.658 --> 00:48:41.290
Until you forgive me...

687
00:48:44.078 --> 00:48:46.219
I won't take one step out of here.

688
00:48:49.819 --> 00:48:51.199
Do whatever you want.

689
00:48:53.129 --> 00:48:57.136
Joon, what happened to that
radiant humanism of yours?

690
00:48:58.373 --> 00:48:59.515
Joon.

691
00:49:01.513 --> 00:49:03.096
Joon?

692
00:49:04.353 --> 00:49:07.618
Joon!

693
00:49:09.187 --> 00:49:10.373
Oh, it's cold.

694
00:49:19.875 --> 00:49:21.944
Misunderstanding, yeah right!

695
00:49:38.027 --> 00:49:39.027
<i>[Joon! Designated Driver]</i>

696
00:49:49.948 --> 00:49:53.533
<i>Joon, are you very busy?
Let's talk for a bit.</i>

697
00:49:56.453 --> 00:49:58.054
<i>Why? What is it?</i>

698
00:50:06.841 --> 00:50:09.638
<i>Do you happen to have any money?</i>

699
00:50:17.042 --> 00:50:18.939
Why all of a sudden?

700
00:50:18.939 --> 00:50:22.326
Is someone sick this time or
did someone get in trouble?

701
00:50:22.326 --> 00:50:24.707
If you threw away your daughter
and got married, then live well.

702
00:50:24.707 --> 00:50:28.294
Why are you always asking
for money? Am I your husband?

703
00:50:28.294 --> 00:50:31.033
My life is hard too. It's hard.

704
00:50:31.033 --> 00:50:33.013
It's really hard for me too!

705
00:50:52.335 --> 00:50:54.855
<i>You worked so hard for Gangsu Group.</i>

706
00:50:54.855 --> 00:50:57.165
You devoted your entire youth to them.

707
00:50:57.165 --> 00:50:59.506
They worked you day and night.

708
00:50:59.506 --> 00:51:02.504
They fired you without even a warning?

709
00:51:04.268 --> 00:51:05.705
Give it a rest.

710
00:51:07.455 --> 00:51:10.024
I'm having a really hard time too.

711
00:51:10.024 --> 00:51:14.714
How could they do that? How could they?

712
00:51:14.714 --> 00:51:18.500
It's so unfair for you. How could they?

713
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.998
Don't you feel so wronged?

714
00:51:20.998 --> 00:51:22.131
<i>Hey, driver.</i>

715
00:51:23.888 --> 00:51:24.935
Yes.

716
00:51:34.806 --> 00:51:37.995
Things must be so hard
for you lately, Woo Sung.

717
00:51:37.995 --> 00:51:41.295
I heard your little brother is hiding
after the trouble he caused.

718
00:51:41.295 --> 00:51:43.775
You must be worried, right?

719
00:51:45.196 --> 00:51:47.308
I'm not worried.

720
00:51:47.308 --> 00:51:49.879
It'll all be resolved tomorrow morning.

721
00:51:49.879 --> 00:51:53.663
He's not going to turn himself in
to the prosecutors, is he?

722
00:51:53.663 --> 00:51:54.779
Wow.

723
00:51:54.779 --> 00:51:58.600
Then Gangsu Group would be yours, right?

724
00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.708
Hey, watch your mouth.

725
00:52:04.029 --> 00:52:07.529
Don't worry.
She's been with me for three years.

726
00:52:07.529 --> 00:52:12.140
She knows better than anyone that she
can't work for me if she talks easily.

727
00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.123
Right, Joon?

728
00:52:14.123 --> 00:52:15.998
Yes, of course.

729
00:52:18.361 --> 00:52:20.219
It's not that he's surrendering himself.

730
00:52:20.219 --> 00:52:23.788
If it's not that, then what?

731
00:52:23.788 --> 00:52:24.920
What is it?

732
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.774
I don't know. I'm tired.

733
00:52:26.774 --> 00:52:30.004
I'm dying of curiosity. Just tell me.

734
00:52:30.004 --> 00:52:32.051
What is it? Tell me.

735
00:52:36.009 --> 00:52:38.770
It's cold. It's cold.

736
00:52:39.853 --> 00:52:42.306
No, it's not cold.

737
00:52:42.306 --> 00:52:44.591
It's not cold.

738
00:52:44.591 --> 00:52:47.152
I will wait for Joon here.

739
00:52:47.152 --> 00:52:49.480
I will wait.

740
00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:54.237
I will show her that
my feelings are sincere.

741
00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:55.600
I will show her.

742
00:53:02.516 --> 00:53:05.641
No... no!

743
00:53:06.975 --> 00:53:10.141
No!

744
00:53:10.808 --> 00:53:13.797
Joon!

745
00:53:14.882 --> 00:53:21.524
Joon!

746
00:53:34.518 --> 00:53:35.685
Get up.

747
00:53:37.665 --> 00:53:40.803
No, I'm going to wait for Joon.

748
00:53:40.803 --> 00:53:42.609
Stop it and get up.

749
00:53:45.645 --> 00:53:48.712
What about Joon? Is she here?

750
00:53:48.712 --> 00:53:51.002
Please go back to the hotel.

751
00:53:51.002 --> 00:53:52.603
Please just go back.

752
00:53:52.603 --> 00:53:56.453
No, I'm going to wait here
for Joon's judgment.

753
00:53:56.453 --> 00:54:00.632
If you're going to be so stubborn,
then cut off your ties with me.

754
00:54:02.134 --> 00:54:04.324
Jae Hoon, why would you say such a thing?

755
00:54:12.154 --> 00:54:13.388
Aren't you going?

756
00:54:14.457 --> 00:54:15.578
I'll go.

757
00:54:42.449 --> 00:54:44.038
I told you.

758
00:54:44.038 --> 00:54:47.910
No news is good news
when it comes to me and my father.

759
00:54:56.529 --> 00:54:58.736
Honey, Honey!

760
00:54:58.736 --> 00:55:00.866
Honey!

761
00:55:00.866 --> 00:55:04.406
- Dad, Dad!
- Honey!

762
00:55:04.406 --> 00:55:07.525
Honey, Honey!

763
00:55:07.525 --> 00:55:10.712
Joon's Dad, Joon's Dad!

764
00:55:10.712 --> 00:55:12.944
Dad, Dad!

765
00:55:15.362 --> 00:55:16.703
<i>Honey!</i>

766
00:55:45.377 --> 00:55:48.263
<i>[Mom]</i>

767
00:56:01.502 --> 00:56:02.779
It's me, Mom.

768
00:56:05.828 --> 00:56:07.579
Have two starting today.

769
00:56:07.579 --> 00:56:11.349
Shouldn't you do that, at least,
considering what you did to me?

770
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:13.739
Otherwise, I might
really call the police.

771
00:56:21.427 --> 00:56:23.217
Let go of me.

772
00:56:30.018 --> 00:56:31.848
What are you planning to do?

773
00:56:31.848 --> 00:56:34.878
You're not really going
to the police, are you?

774
00:56:34.878 --> 00:56:37.708
Ah, I don't know.

775
00:56:37.708 --> 00:56:40.016
How much will you
give me if I stay quiet?

776
00:56:40.016 --> 00:56:42.105
I need some money quickly.

777
00:56:42.105 --> 00:56:43.556
Are you going to be this way?

778
00:56:43.556 --> 00:56:46.523
Because of that troublemaker
rich guy you work for

779
00:56:46.523 --> 00:56:49.878
I lost my hotel job and
things aren't so good for me.

780
00:56:49.878 --> 00:56:51.726
How much do you want to offer?

781
00:56:51.726 --> 00:56:54.186
How much do you want to offer
for me to keep my mouth shut?

782
00:56:56.179 --> 00:57:00.266
You should know there are many
other ways to do this.

783
00:57:01.884 --> 00:57:04.813
Oh, you're coming on strong.

784
00:57:04.813 --> 00:57:08.663
Why? Will you hurt me if I talk?

785
00:57:08.663 --> 00:57:11.179
Hey, you're not even the victim.

786
00:57:11.179 --> 00:57:13.643
She settled and accepted it.

787
00:57:13.643 --> 00:57:15.744
Do you think you have
the right to act like this?

788
00:57:15.744 --> 00:57:18.985
Social justice and
getting rid of corruption.

789
00:57:20.085 --> 00:57:22.835
I'm thinking I should cut off this
corruption while I can.

790
00:57:22.835 --> 00:57:25.324
I want to make this into a just country.

791
00:57:25.324 --> 00:57:26.683
What do you think?

792
00:57:28.748 --> 00:57:33.155
This is why people need
to walk a careful path.

793
00:57:33.155 --> 00:57:38.005
If employment status is unstable,
society will always act up and complain.

794
00:57:38.005 --> 00:57:40.815
That's the state you're in.

795
00:57:40.815 --> 00:57:42.083
That's correct.

796
00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:45.474
That's why I really
hate rich conglomerates.

797
00:57:45.474 --> 00:57:47.715
It's really funny if you think about it.

798
00:57:47.715 --> 00:57:52.706
Your chairman's son runs away and
society ends up with more power.

799
00:57:52.706 --> 00:57:55.764
The reporters are all waiting
in front of the company today too.

800
00:58:00.978 --> 00:58:02.021
Do you mean it?

801
00:58:02.021 --> 00:58:04.233
- What?
- Money.

802
00:58:04.233 --> 00:58:05.931
Do you really need it?

803
00:58:10.704 --> 00:58:13.192
You're not on the same side.

804
00:58:14.067 --> 00:58:15.163
What do you mean?

805
00:58:20.099 --> 00:58:23.271
He's not going to turn himself in
to the prosecutors, is he?

806
00:58:23.271 --> 00:58:24.996
It's not that he's surrendering himself.

807
00:58:24.996 --> 00:58:28.083
If it's not that, then what?

808
00:58:28.083 --> 00:58:30.137
What is it?

809
00:58:32.429 --> 00:58:33.889
What do you think?

810
00:58:36.424 --> 00:58:37.965
<i>In my experience...</i>

811
00:58:37.965 --> 00:58:40.088
<i>these things are usually
from someone on the inside.</i>

812
00:58:40.088 --> 00:58:42.985
Enemies are usually someone close by.

813
00:58:45.139 --> 00:58:47.485
Where is Hyuk now?

814
00:58:47.485 --> 00:58:50.125
Have you seen him before?

815
00:58:53.364 --> 00:58:57.728
He's the second son of Gangsu Group's
Byun Gang Su, Byun Hyuk.

816
00:58:57.728 --> 00:58:59.945
Do you know him?

817
00:58:59.945 --> 00:59:01.514
Ah, oh...

818
00:59:03.576 --> 00:59:08.011
We got a call that he caused a scene
here and got kicked out.

819
00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:12.951
How could you kick out
a VIP guest like that?

820
00:59:12.951 --> 00:59:15.719
If CEO Byun Gang Su finds out...

821
00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:19.574
that his son was chased out in that
manner, what do you think will happen?

822
00:59:19.574 --> 00:59:22.027
I... I'm sorry.

823
00:59:22.027 --> 00:59:26.587
Our hotel has never kicked anyone out.

824
00:59:26.587 --> 00:59:29.009
- You haven't?
- No. Never.

825
00:59:29.009 --> 00:59:33.958
That kind of unfortunate event
has never happened in our hotel.

826
00:59:33.958 --> 00:59:35.559
- Is that right?
- Of course.

827
00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:44.266
Hello.

828
00:59:48.219 --> 00:59:50.565
You know who I am now, right?

829
00:59:50.565 --> 00:59:52.358
Yes, of course.

830
01:00:06.056 --> 01:00:07.286
Hey, parking.

831
01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:10.681
The police may go looking for him.

832
01:00:10.681 --> 01:00:12.257
Hide him so he doesn't get caught.

833
01:00:12.257 --> 01:00:15.275
We can't fix it if he shows up now.

834
01:00:17.389 --> 01:00:19.246
Can I get a card for my room?

835
01:00:31.969 --> 01:00:34.766
Oh, that's a cool uniform.

836
01:00:34.766 --> 01:00:36.230
That's a great fit.

837
01:00:47.889 --> 01:00:49.764
<i>To his room!</i>

838
01:00:49.764 --> 01:00:50.840
Here you go.

839
01:00:52.047 --> 01:00:53.058
Thank you.

840
01:01:07.567 --> 01:01:10.293
Oops! Oh my, oh my.

841
01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:12.391
I'm so sorry. What can I do?

842
01:01:12.391 --> 01:01:14.478
- I'm sorry.
- This is nothing.

843
01:01:19.786 --> 01:01:22.895
Don't be like that. Just take it off.

844
01:01:22.895 --> 01:01:25.304
I can dry it for you.
It will only take 10 minutes.

845
01:01:25.304 --> 01:01:26.835
Exactly 10 minutes.

846
01:01:44.661 --> 01:01:47.257
I can't do that while I'm on duty.

847
01:01:47.257 --> 01:01:49.384
Goodbye, then.

848
01:01:49.384 --> 01:01:50.478
Excuse me.

849
01:01:52.476 --> 01:01:53.683
Excuse me...

850
01:02:49.101 --> 01:02:50.639
My sweet home.

851
01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:55.349
My sweet home. My sweet home.

852
01:03:34.858 --> 01:03:37.438
Home sweet home. Home sweet home.

853
01:03:41.304 --> 01:03:42.505
This is nice.

854
01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:15.460
Hey... what are you doing?

855
01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:18.050
Keep the car waiting downstairs.
I'll bring him out.

856
01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:19.777
We'll talk details later.

857
01:04:24.471 --> 01:04:28.521
I can't believe things
are over with Joon.

858
01:04:36.951 --> 01:04:38.382
Are you sad?

859
01:04:39.433 --> 01:04:40.652
I'm sad too.

860
01:04:46.786 --> 01:04:47.907
Is that Jae Hoon?

861
01:04:51.759 --> 01:04:54.212
<i>[My Friend, Jae Hoon]</i>

862
01:04:55.681 --> 01:04:57.842
- Yeah, Jae Hoon.
- Hurry up and open the door.

863
01:05:26.181 --> 01:05:29.434
I'm here for your
dry cleaning. Are you inside?

864
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:36.192
<i>Don't say a word.</i>

865
01:05:46.891 --> 01:05:48.924
Joon, what's going on? Why are you here?

866
01:05:48.924 --> 01:05:50.398
Are you working here again?

867
01:05:50.398 --> 01:05:51.893
- Get inside.
- Inside?

868
01:05:51.893 --> 01:05:54.123
I don't have time to explain. Get inside.

869
01:05:54.123 --> 01:05:55.554
<i>The police are outside.</i>

870
01:05:55.554 --> 01:05:58.436
I think they know you're here.

871
01:05:58.436 --> 01:06:01.556
Joon, you're here to help me?

872
01:06:01.556 --> 01:06:05.110
So, you were worried
about me, weren't you?

873
01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:07.498
No, I'm here because of money.

874
01:06:07.498 --> 01:06:09.587
- Huh?
- What?

875
01:06:09.587 --> 01:06:12.030
<i>There's a girl?</i>

876
01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:17.223
To put it simply, Hyuk has the fortune
of the folk character, On Dal.

877
01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:18.657
That's what I'm saying.

878
01:06:18.657 --> 01:06:24.326
So, Hyuk needs to be with this
girl in order to become a great man.

879
01:06:24.326 --> 01:06:28.085
She's already close to him,
a girl like Pyung Gang.

880
01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:31.866
I think I'll charge five million won
to get you out. How about it?

881
01:06:35.552 --> 01:06:37.509
No? I'll leave if you don't want to.

882
01:06:45.078 --> 01:06:46.152
I'm in.

883
01:06:49.465 --> 01:06:50.588
What?

884
01:06:51.811 --> 01:06:53.889
I have a condition too though.

885
01:06:53.889 --> 01:06:55.529
What's the condition?

886
01:06:55.529 --> 01:07:00.197
Until I can go home...
will you stay by my side, Joon?

887
01:07:00.197 --> 01:07:02.146
- What?
- Hey.

888
01:07:02.146 --> 01:07:05.052
I have nowhere to go because
the police are following me.

889
01:07:05.052 --> 01:07:07.844
I have to be on the run for now.

890
01:07:07.844 --> 01:07:10.871
I think I'll be less scared
with you by my side.

891
01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:13.141
What kind of crazy things
are you saying?

892
01:07:13.141 --> 01:07:16.371
I'll pay you the average salary
of a Gangsu Group secretary.

893
01:07:18.244 --> 01:07:21.320
You'll work from the time
you wake up until you go to sleep.

894
01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.433
What do you think?

895
01:07:30.828 --> 01:07:32.273
Hey, are you insane?

896
01:07:32.273 --> 01:07:34.822
- Who are you...
- My work schedule...

897
01:07:34.822 --> 01:07:37.246
will be 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

898
01:07:37.246 --> 01:07:39.092
- What?
- Okay.

899
01:07:39.092 --> 01:07:41.550
No personal conversation
and no personal chores.

900
01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:43.476
You are not allowed
to pretend we are friends.

901
01:07:44.802 --> 01:07:47.072
Isn't that kind of harsh?

902
01:07:47.072 --> 01:07:48.527
What? You don't like it?

903
01:07:51.608 --> 01:07:53.518
- I'm in.
- <i>Hey.</i>

904
01:07:53.518 --> 01:07:55.579
What are you two doing?

905
01:07:55.579 --> 01:07:57.648
Hello? Hello?

906
01:07:57.648 --> 01:08:00.259
- <i>Hello?</i>
- This is important. Can you be quiet?

907
01:08:00.259 --> 01:08:01.554
What did you say?

908
01:08:06.762 --> 01:08:11.087
Then is today our first day?

909
01:08:14.495 --> 01:08:16.120
Yes, day one.

910
01:08:17.164 --> 01:08:18.343
What? Day one?

911
