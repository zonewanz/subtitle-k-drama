3
00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:08.674
Is it starting or what?

4
00:00:09.174 --> 00:00:10.174
What?

5
00:00:11.313 --> 00:00:12.414
Seo Jin.

6
00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:17.553
That's right.

7
00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:22.654
- Hey! - What?

8
00:00:22.654 --> 00:00:24.654
Come here, and watch this.

9
00:00:24.654 --> 00:00:26.253
I don't think the girl will show up.

10
00:00:26.253 --> 00:00:27.764
- Kim Jong Min got tricked. - Is she coming?

11
00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:30.494
I think he got tricked.

12
00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:32.163
So Yeon!

13
00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:36.904
Why did you turn it off?

14
00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:37.974
I told you to play with Seo Jin.

15
00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:39.603
Why are you watching TV again?

16
00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:41.773
What's so interesting about a celebrity blind date?

17
00:00:41.773 --> 00:00:43.913
Blind dates give me the shudders.

18
00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:45.614
Because of you.

19
00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:47.444
If I studied harder back then,

20
00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:50.284
I could've become a judge, prosecutor, or doctor.

21
00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:52.853
It's not like I have fond memories of blind dates.

22
00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.324
Judge or prosecutor, my foot.

23
00:00:54.324 --> 00:00:56.523
Studying hard doesn't mean you'll become a judge or prosecutor.

24
00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.224
Usually people who study hard become judges or prosecutors.

25
00:01:02.423 --> 00:01:05.064
Right. Sure. Whatever.

26
00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:06.803
Anyway, if you hadn't seduced me,

27
00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:08.933
I wouldn't be living like this now.

28
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.773
You're the one who seduced me.

29
00:01:10.773 --> 00:01:11.874
You winked...

30
00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.713
like this. I thought you had an eye twitch.

31
00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:19.144
You're remembering it all wrong.

32
00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:20.683
You flirted with me first.

33
00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:24.084
You stared at me like you really wanted me.

34
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.183
Like this.

35
00:01:29.353 --> 00:01:31.053
You went like this first.

36
00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:33.663
You were acting all cute like this.

37
00:01:33.663 --> 00:01:34.663
Don't you remember?

38
00:01:34.663 --> 00:01:37.133
I picked you because I was scared. I'm serious.

39
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.734
No, you flirted first.

40
00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:41.663
You winked at me like this.

41
00:01:41.663 --> 00:01:43.603
No. No, I didn't.

42
00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.874
You flirted with me first.

43
00:01:44.874 --> 00:01:46.234
Why would I...

44
00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:56.144
(Episode 2, Memories are remembered at your convenience)

45
00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.394
Nam Gil. You have Professor Hwang's class, right?

46
00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:08.224
I got this from the seniors who took that class last year.

47
00:02:08.224 --> 00:02:09.363
Please take it.

48
00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:10.964
You should keep it.

49
00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:14.133
Nam Gil, this just came out. Try it.

50
00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.203
It's okay, you drink it.

51
00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:26.913
Goodness, who's your daddy?

52
00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.784
You're looking so fine.

53
00:02:28.784 --> 00:02:30.254
He's been brought up so well.

54
00:02:30.853 --> 00:02:33.224
Goodness, why did I leave him...

55
00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:35.724
for such a pathetic guy?

56
00:02:39.923 --> 00:02:41.323
Hello.

57
00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:44.733
Nam Gil.

58
00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:50.173
You must be going to your class.

59
00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:20.804
"You must be going to your class."

60
00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.733
Do you think he's here to play pool then?

61
00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:25.833
Have you lost your mind?

62
00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.004
Or are you feeling lonely all of a sudden...

63
00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:29.603
and want to go on a date?

64
00:03:29.603 --> 00:03:30.744
What?

65
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:32.774
I said hi because I was happy to see him.

66
00:03:33.643 --> 00:03:34.944
You were happy to see him?

67
00:03:35.684 --> 00:03:37.814
After you embarrassed him yesterday?

68
00:03:38.254 --> 00:03:39.254
What?

69
00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:42.154
- It's Nam Gil. - Goodness.

70
00:03:42.323 --> 00:03:44.054
- He's so handsome. - Gosh.

71
00:03:46.863 --> 00:03:47.863
You.

72
00:03:48.964 --> 00:03:50.363
Go on a date with me.

73
00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.293
- What? - He just asked her out.

74
00:03:52.293 --> 00:03:53.434
No.

75
00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.233
Why not?

76
00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:00.543
You smell like sweat.

77
00:04:05.043 --> 00:04:06.684
How dare she say no to Nam Gil?

78
00:04:06.684 --> 00:04:07.684
What's wrong with her?

79
00:04:07.684 --> 00:04:08.844
- Goodness. - What?

80
00:04:08.844 --> 00:04:11.054
- How dare she? - She's crazy.

81
00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.983
I'm shocked.

82
00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:14.684
Goodness.

83
00:04:16.854 --> 00:04:17.994
No way.

84
00:04:18.294 --> 00:04:19.694
When did I do that?

85
00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:21.593
Yesterday!

86
00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:24.463
Yesterday you dumped him because he smelled.

87
00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:26.763
Today you said hi because you were happy to see him.

88
00:04:29.263 --> 00:04:30.973
You're scary.

89
00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:34.843
Goodness. My gosh.

90
00:04:35.273 --> 00:04:37.473
That's why he looked hurt.

91
00:04:38.213 --> 00:04:39.244
My goodness.

92
00:04:39.573 --> 00:04:41.544
Why did I say that?

93
00:04:42.513 --> 00:04:44.314
How would I know?

94
00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:47.854
He must've smelled because he had just finished his workout.

95
00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.223
You're such a germaphobe.

96
00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:51.624
Right.

97
00:04:52.754 --> 00:04:54.694
I must be crazy.

98
00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:57.093
I'm crazy.

99
00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:01.434
Are you sick?

100
00:05:07.544 --> 00:05:09.403
It's not just kids these days,

101
00:05:09.403 --> 00:05:11.573
but kids in general are scary.

102
00:05:11.843 --> 00:05:13.883
Seniors of any department are your seniors.

103
00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:17.184
I know you guys are idiots,

104
00:05:17.354 --> 00:05:18.814
but I won't allow revolts.

105
00:05:19.354 --> 00:05:20.823
Stick to the rules.

106
00:05:20.823 --> 00:05:23.854
We'll deal with other seniors ourselves.

107
00:05:24.694 --> 00:05:26.323
Gosh, these punks.

108
00:05:26.323 --> 00:05:28.393
At least they're playing fair.

109
00:05:28.564 --> 00:05:30.994
I'm so tired.

110
00:05:30.994 --> 00:05:33.133
How long do I have to stay like this?

111
00:05:33.263 --> 00:05:34.633
I'm dying.

112
00:05:36.374 --> 00:05:37.533
Sir.

113
00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:40.044
How long do we need to do this?

114
00:05:40.044 --> 00:05:41.643
Don't whine.

115
00:05:41.773 --> 00:05:43.573
Unless a girl walks into this classroom,

116
00:05:43.573 --> 00:05:44.914
you'll stay like this.

117
00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:47.484
There are no girls in the engineering department.

118
00:05:48.013 --> 00:05:50.283
He's telling us to stay like this forever.

119
00:06:15.073 --> 00:06:16.073
It's a girl.

120
00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:28.453
It's a girl.

121
00:06:31.093 --> 00:06:33.194
Come in. Please come in.

122
00:06:34.023 --> 00:06:35.124
Come in.

123
00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:36.533
Come in here.

124
00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:37.633
(Hankook University, Civil Construction Department)

125
00:06:59.513 --> 00:07:00.754
I'm sorry I'm late.

126
00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:11.734
Crazy punk.

127
00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:15.004
Go Dok Jae.

128

Your hair.

129

Everyone, down!

130
00:07:31.254 --> 00:07:33.723
You have no conscience.

131
00:07:33.723 --> 00:07:35.653
He's a young man.

132
00:07:35.653 --> 00:07:37.794
Of course you sweat when you work out.

133
00:07:38.153 --> 00:07:40.364
Why did you dump him like that?

134
00:07:40.424 --> 00:07:42.624
Gosh, Ma Jin Joo.

135
00:07:59.314 --> 00:08:00.544
Hi, Jin Joo.

136
00:08:03.614 --> 00:08:06.054
- What's her name? - Hi.

137
00:08:06.054 --> 00:08:07.054
I think she's the department representative.

138
00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:09.723
Department representative, erase the board.

139
00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:10.794
Okay.

140
00:08:12.624 --> 00:08:13.624
I'm wrong.

141
00:08:14.023 --> 00:08:15.194
She's the department representative.

142
00:08:27.104 --> 00:08:28.104
Hey!

143
00:08:29.914 --> 00:08:30.914
Chun Sul!

144
00:08:34.544 --> 00:08:35.713
You're Chun Sul, right?

145
00:08:35.814 --> 00:08:37.113
What's wrong with you?

146
00:08:37.113 --> 00:08:38.884
You sound like you found your missing family.

147
00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:41.524
The professor is here. Sit down.

148
00:08:41.884 --> 00:08:43.353
Okay.

149
00:08:49.264 --> 00:08:52.564
That's right. This was when we used to always hang out.

150
00:08:52.634 --> 00:08:55.963
But she suddenly took a leave, and we lost contact.

151
00:08:59.003 --> 00:09:02.444
Did I do something wrong to Jin Joo?

152
00:09:05.213 --> 00:09:06.213
I'm not sure.

153
00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:09.083
Did she cause trouble this morning?

154
00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:10.654
Everyone's talking.

155
00:09:16.493 --> 00:09:17.924
Words travel fast.

156
00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:23.794
Why did she take a leave without saying anything?

157
00:09:26.264 --> 00:09:29.564
(Regent Heungseon versus Empress Myeongseong)

158
00:09:29.564 --> 00:09:32.274
Did you all prepare for your group presentations?

159
00:09:32.503 --> 00:09:33.843
- Yes. - Yes.

160
00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.174
I can't believe this.

161
00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:37.343
I'm back in school taking classes.

162
00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:39.644
In late Joseon Dynasty, Regent Heungseon,

163
00:09:39.644 --> 00:09:41.684
Empress Myeongseong's father-in-law, and the empress,

164
00:09:41.684 --> 00:09:45.853
were always in a power struggle over different policies.

165
00:09:45.853 --> 00:09:49.384
Even Empress Myeongseong was suffered by the in-laws.

166
00:09:49.483 --> 00:09:50.593
It's horrible.

167
00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.064
This led to the fall of Joseon Dynasty.

168
00:09:53.064 --> 00:09:55.963
Let's see how you prepared the presentation.

169
00:09:55.963 --> 00:09:58.664
Because of the refusal of establishing a trade policy,

170
00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:01.404
modernization was delayed. That is why...

171
00:10:01.404 --> 00:10:03.203
we support Empress Myeongseong.

172
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.503
She's on the daughter-in-law's side.

173
00:10:06.134 --> 00:10:09.073
Yes, you're going to go through that later.

174
00:10:09.473 --> 00:10:11.073
All right. Next group.

175
00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:14.814
Who's the presenter for the next group?

176
00:10:18.583 --> 00:10:19.613
Hey.

177
00:10:19.924 --> 00:10:21.083
- What are you doing? - What?

178
00:10:21.284 --> 00:10:22.424
Go.

179
00:10:23.054 --> 00:10:24.123
Where?

180
00:10:25.054 --> 00:10:26.323
Where's the presenter for the next group?

181
00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:29.194
You are the presenter for our group.

182
00:10:29.264 --> 00:10:30.534
- Go. - Me?

183
00:10:30.534 --> 00:10:31.863
- Go. - Me?

184
00:10:31.863 --> 00:10:32.934
What? Wait. Hey.

185
00:10:33.564 --> 00:10:35.103
- Go. - Good luck.

186
00:10:46.343 --> 00:10:47.514
Are you Ma Jin Joo from group three?

187
00:10:50.853 --> 00:10:51.884
What should I do?

188
00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:53.223
- Start. - Good luck.

189
00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:04.664
I...

190
00:11:06.463 --> 00:11:09.103
I forgot what we debated about in the group.

191
00:11:12.434 --> 00:11:14.743
Did you debate about it 10 years ago or something?

192
00:11:14.973 --> 00:11:16.644
It hasn't been long. How can you forget?

193
00:11:22.113 --> 00:11:24.483
Then just tell me what you think.

194
00:11:25.514 --> 00:11:27.583
Is it Regent Heungseon Daewongun or Empress Myeongseong?

195
00:11:30.593 --> 00:11:31.654
I...

196
00:11:33.093 --> 00:11:34.593
think Emperor Gojong was the one that made a mistake.

197
00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:40.733
Emperor Gojong? Why?

198
00:11:41.564 --> 00:11:44.473
It was a fight between his wife and his father.

199
00:11:44.473 --> 00:11:46.073
In that case,

200
00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:48.804
he has to step in so that they can move out or...

201
00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:52.843
We're talking about the palace in Joseon Dynasty.

202
00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.343
Yes.

203
00:11:54.444 --> 00:11:55.784
Regardless,

204
00:11:55.784 --> 00:11:59.284
in these types of households, the husband is always the problem.

205
00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:01.083
They can't mediate in the middle.

206
00:12:01.184 --> 00:12:03.493
There's no daughter-in-law who can win a father-in-law.

207
00:12:03.593 --> 00:12:07.294
But that doesn't mean she should listen to him blindly.

208
00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:09.993
Daughter-in-laws like us are not puzzles that fit in perfectly.

209
00:12:11.194 --> 00:12:12.294
Us?

210
00:12:16.264 --> 00:12:19.073
So you think Emperor Gojong led the country to its downfall?

211
00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:22.174
I believe that that is a possibility.

212
00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.514
It's a fresh opinion.

213
00:12:29.184 --> 00:12:30.253
Good.

214
00:12:31.154 --> 00:12:32.414
Who are the members of group three?

215
00:12:44.564 --> 00:12:46.703
(F, Lack of understanding of the topic)

216
00:12:47.404 --> 00:12:48.534
What did you do?

217
00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:50.274
We did this so long ago.

218
00:12:50.404 --> 00:12:51.774
How would I continue?

219
00:12:51.873 --> 00:12:53.843
We debated yesterday.

220
00:12:54.003 --> 00:12:56.274
Let's say you forgot the contents of the debate.

221
00:12:57.073 --> 00:12:58.573
But why did you say Emperor Gojong?

222
00:12:59.243 --> 00:13:01.213
She did ask my opinion.

223
00:13:01.483 --> 00:13:02.784
You don't know this,

224
00:13:02.784 --> 00:13:04.853
but father-in-laws are harder to please than mother-in-laws.

225
00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:08.424
He's so picky that he won't have kimchi with sand lance extract.

226
00:13:09.184 --> 00:13:10.493
Gosh, I thought about him again.

227
00:13:10.493 --> 00:13:12.093
- Who? - A father-in-law...

228
00:13:12.453 --> 00:13:14.524
who acts like a mother-in-law.

229
00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.034
Give it to me.

230
00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:19.733
Here.

231
00:13:25.274 --> 00:13:26.444
I taste sand lance extract.

232
00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:29.343
You know I don't have kimchi unless it's made from anchovy extract.

233
00:13:29.573 --> 00:13:31.243
Do it again. Do it again! I'm not eating this!

234
00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:32.814
I'm not eating this!

235
00:13:34.684 --> 00:13:37.514
It feels like I'm living with my mother-in-law.

236
00:13:37.554 --> 00:13:38.784
Isn't this too harsh?

237
00:13:39.453 --> 00:13:41.784
She wanted my opinion.

238
00:13:42.424 --> 00:13:43.593
I can't believe this.

239
00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:46.123
I can't believe this.

240
00:13:46.424 --> 00:13:47.863
Is this your concept today?

241
00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:52.294
(Movie Club)

242
00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:04.314
Gosh, it's been such a long time since I saw films like this.

243
00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:06.514
My goodness.

244
00:14:09.284 --> 00:14:10.914
"Grand Blue".

245
00:14:12.613 --> 00:14:15.483
We have "Flash Man" too.

246
00:14:19.194 --> 00:14:20.394
Brad Pitt.

247
00:14:22.164 --> 00:14:23.794
Now I remember.

248
00:14:23.993 --> 00:14:25.463
Dok Jae, your hair is the same as Brad Pitt.

249
00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:28.904
Gosh, you youngsters.

250
00:14:29.564 --> 00:14:31.674
When would I see you like this again?

251
00:14:31.674 --> 00:14:32.774
Come here.

252
00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:35.203
Gosh, you're adorable.

253
00:14:35.203 --> 00:14:36.743
What's wrong with you?

254
00:14:38.243 --> 00:14:39.514
You're adorable.

255
00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:42.314
Gosh, you're adorable.

256
00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:48.524
It's been so long.

257
00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:51.194
I will kill you.

258
00:14:52.493 --> 00:14:53.564
Hey.

259
00:14:54.664 --> 00:14:56.794
You can't say that to me.

260
00:14:56.794 --> 00:14:57.894
No,

261
00:14:57.993 --> 00:14:59.164
I meant him.

262
00:14:59.904 --> 00:15:01.103
You...

263
00:15:01.203 --> 00:15:02.434
Did you drink this morning?

264
00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:04.373
Why are you laughing over there?

265
00:15:05.503 --> 00:15:06.843
Do you see my hand shaking?

266
00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:10.044
You... Because of you my arm almost broke.

267
00:15:10.314 --> 00:15:12.814
Are you bored? Are you bored of your life or something?

268
00:15:12.973 --> 00:15:15.983
Is that why you have decided to live a spectacular life?

269
00:15:16.144 --> 00:15:17.483
My gosh.

270
00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:20.253
My life is already a spectacle.

271
00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.554
What is that crazy thing saying?

272
00:15:21.554 --> 00:15:22.784
Are you still drunk?

273
00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:25.154
Okay.

274
00:15:25.493 --> 00:15:27.623
Right, I'll explain everything to you.

275
00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:29.294
Listen carefully, kids.

276
00:15:29.294 --> 00:15:31.664
I don't know what this is.

277
00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:33.934
But what you are not seeing everything right.

278
00:15:34.003 --> 00:15:35.804
You think I'm Choi Ban Do,

279
00:15:36.134 --> 00:15:37.233
but I'm not...

280
00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:39.503
the Choi Ban Do you think I am.

281
00:15:39.804 --> 00:15:41.674
If you're not Ma Jin Joo, who are you?

282
00:15:41.973 --> 00:15:44.674
I mean to say that I'm not 20 years old.

283
00:15:44.674 --> 00:15:46.073
I came back to the past.

284
00:15:46.174 --> 00:15:48.384
How would I remember what happened 18 years ago?

285
00:15:49.613 --> 00:15:50.983
You're 38 years old?

286
00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:54.953
With this face?

287
00:16:00.963 --> 00:16:02.593
I have my 20-year-old face.

288
00:16:02.664 --> 00:16:05.164
When I opened my eyes this morning, I was 20.

289
00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:06.603
The year 1999.

290
00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:09.934
So it's something like a time slip, right?

291
00:16:09.934 --> 00:16:12.804
It's like something that happened in the movie "Back to the Future".

292
00:16:12.934 --> 00:16:15.373
Yes, that it. "Back to the Future".

293
00:16:15.503 --> 00:16:17.613
Gosh, you're clever, Jae Woo.

294
00:16:20.284 --> 00:16:21.743
What am I like in the future?

295
00:16:22.914 --> 00:16:23.953
You?

296
00:16:23.953 --> 00:16:26.253
Wait. This won't stop.

297
00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:27.753
Massage my hand.

298
00:16:29.323 --> 00:16:30.493
Goodness.

299
00:16:53.483 --> 00:16:54.583
Oh, my gosh.

300
00:16:54.983 --> 00:16:58.014
How much do you have to work out to make a body like that?

301
00:17:01.184 --> 00:17:02.684
Go easy on yourself.

302
00:17:02.753 --> 00:17:04.493
If we get hurt at our age, we can't even fix it.

303
00:17:04.694 --> 00:17:06.664
I'm more worried about your bodies.

304
00:17:09.223 --> 00:17:10.563
Work out more.

305
00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:12.094
How does my batting skills look?

306
00:17:12.793 --> 00:17:15.733
But the director keeps saying that I lost it.

307
00:17:16.503 --> 00:17:17.973
This season looks hopeful.

308
00:17:18.374 --> 00:17:19.503
We need to make it...

309
00:17:19.803 --> 00:17:21.003
to the Korean Series this time.

310
00:17:23.973 --> 00:17:27.684
(Cheerleading Fairy)

311
00:17:30.283 --> 00:17:31.614
You get healthy.

312
00:17:31.614 --> 00:17:32.753
Really healthy.

313
00:17:33.283 --> 00:17:34.523
How about him?

314
00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:36.453
Does he walk around in this?

315
00:17:36.453 --> 00:17:37.854
- Don't. - Gosh.

316
00:17:38.094 --> 00:17:39.924
His hair might fall out.

317
00:17:40.063 --> 00:17:41.664
Cut your hair. I don't want to see that.

318
00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:42.793
Shut it.

319
00:17:42.793 --> 00:17:44.394
Gosh, you shouldn't say that.

320
00:17:44.733 --> 00:17:45.793
No, Dok Jae,

321
00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:47.233
do anything you want to your hair.

322
00:17:47.303 --> 00:17:49.164
Get perms, cuts, and dyes. Do everything.

323
00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:51.074
Just don't shave it off.

324
00:17:51.074 --> 00:17:52.374
You can do that any time.

325
00:17:52.374 --> 00:17:53.644
What are you talking about?

326
00:17:54.803 --> 00:17:55.904
How about me?

327
00:17:56.043 --> 00:17:57.144
Do I...

328
00:17:57.844 --> 00:17:59.043
have a girlfriend?

329
00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:03.253
A girlfriend? Well...

330
00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:12.023
- Do you like it? - Yes.

331
00:18:12.354 --> 00:18:14.324
It's in the yacht.

332
00:18:21.003 --> 00:18:22.203
Honey...

333
00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:40.483
Do you think you only have a girlfriend?

334
00:18:40.584 --> 00:18:41.983
You also have a wife.

335
00:18:42.424 --> 00:18:43.953
I own an aerobic dance academy...

336
00:18:43.953 --> 00:18:45.253
and participate in a woman's rights group?

337
00:18:46.223 --> 00:18:47.293
Me?

338
00:18:49.023 --> 00:18:50.664
Imagine you are slapping someone.

339
00:18:52.063 --> 00:18:54.864
Imagine your husband in front of you. Slap him hard.

340
00:18:54.963 --> 00:18:56.104
Slap.

341
00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:58.404
Yes, just like that.

342
00:18:58.503 --> 00:19:00.473
Jump! Jump!

343
00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:01.743
Kick!

344
00:19:02.273 --> 00:19:04.674
Your husband is acting up. Kick!

345
00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:06.313
Go, go.

346
00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:08.983
If you hit the wrong part, it's your loss.

347
00:19:11.313 --> 00:19:13.654
You're not exactly a women's rights activist,

348
00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:15.324
but it's something similar to that.

349
00:19:16.993 --> 00:19:18.924
It sounds realistic.

350
00:19:19.723 --> 00:19:22.324
I don't know what this is,

351
00:19:22.324 --> 00:19:23.694
and I'm shocked.

352
00:19:23.793 --> 00:19:25.664
Until yesterday, I was with that...

353
00:19:29.364 --> 00:19:31.033
Gosh. Anyhow,

354
00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:33.444
I'm so shocked right now.

355
00:19:33.644 --> 00:19:36.003
It happened before my wounds could heal.

356
00:19:36.003 --> 00:19:39.344
I can't explain everything to you.

357
00:19:39.414 --> 00:19:41.243
But if I'm acting weirdly,

358
00:19:41.414 --> 00:19:44.813
please understand as I'm from the future.

359
00:19:46.253 --> 00:19:47.753
- You have wounds. - You have wounds.

360
00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:53.493
We didn't know that.

361
00:19:54.763 --> 00:19:55.963
It's okay.

362
00:19:57.134 --> 00:19:58.594
You idiot.

363
00:20:01.063 --> 00:20:02.233
You're crazy.

364
00:20:02.303 --> 00:20:03.574
You must be out of your mind.

365
00:20:03.574 --> 00:20:05.273
Is it April Fool's Day all over again?

366
00:20:05.503 --> 00:20:07.844
Maybe she became crazy because she studied too much.

367
00:20:07.844 --> 00:20:09.944
Your lies are evolving every day.

368
00:20:09.944 --> 00:20:11.313
Where's that time machine?

369
00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:13.344
Did you park it at your house?

370
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.114
Let's go see the time machine.

371
00:20:18.114 --> 00:20:19.154
I'm hungry.

372
00:20:19.154 --> 00:20:20.424
Let's go eat.

373
00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:22.924
Smart kids are meticulous.

374
00:20:22.924 --> 00:20:25.154
They tell such detailed lies.

375
00:20:26.924 --> 00:20:29.194
Do you think I'm saying this because I believe it?

376
00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:31.563
Wait for me.

377
00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.104
I don't know the way.

378
00:20:33.104 --> 00:20:35.104
Nobody would believe me.

379
00:20:36.473 --> 00:20:39.003
Gosh, those young punks.

380
00:20:39.003 --> 00:20:40.043
Wait for me.

381
00:20:41.703 --> 00:20:43.914
I don't know the way!

382
00:20:44.114 --> 00:20:45.444
Excuse me.

383
00:21:06.963 --> 00:21:09.003
I kept watching you.

384
00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:10.273
Because you're pretty.

385
00:21:16.973 --> 00:21:17.973
Me?

386
00:21:18.574 --> 00:21:19.574
Really?

387
00:21:20.084 --> 00:21:21.084
Yes.

388
00:21:22.844 --> 00:21:24.453
If you don't mind,

389
00:21:24.453 --> 00:21:26.354
could you give me your number?

390
00:21:27.184 --> 00:21:29.793
Goodness, I can't believe this.

391
00:21:30.154 --> 00:21:31.394
He thinks I'm pretty.

392
00:21:32.753 --> 00:21:34.263
Well...

393
00:21:34.263 --> 00:21:38.894
I don't have a cell phone or a pager.

394
00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:41.803
I see.

395
00:21:41.864 --> 00:21:43.533
Then can I get your home phone number?

396
00:21:44.074 --> 00:21:45.904
My home phone number? What is it?

397
00:21:46.203 --> 00:21:47.703
I can't remember.

398
00:21:47.703 --> 00:21:49.444
I don't remember...

399
00:21:50.114 --> 00:21:51.944
I'm not doing this on purpose.

400
00:21:52.374 --> 00:21:53.884
I really don't know.

401
00:21:54.243 --> 00:21:57.114
Then tell me your department and where you live.

402
00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:07.324
Goodness.

403
00:22:07.493 --> 00:22:10.793
Wait. I have a pager.

404
00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:12.063
Goodness.

405
00:22:15.604 --> 00:22:17.233
Isn't he that freshman from English department?

406
00:22:17.434 --> 00:22:19.003
What? Did you dump him too?

407
00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:20.803
Give him your number.

408
00:22:20.904 --> 00:22:22.273
It doesn't cost money.

409
00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:23.813
Giving your number doesn't mean you're going out.

410
00:22:24.114 --> 00:22:27.414
The pretty ones always act so snobby.

411
00:22:34.684 --> 00:22:37.053
He really told me I was pretty.

412
00:22:37.053 --> 00:22:38.394
Every time I pass by,

413
00:22:38.594 --> 00:22:41.523
he says, "You look pretty today."

414
00:22:41.723 --> 00:22:44.394
He's trying to sell something.

415
00:22:44.394 --> 00:22:46.094
Who's pretty? You?

416
00:22:46.094 --> 00:22:47.203
Is he on drugs?

417
00:22:48.003 --> 00:22:49.434
No.

418
00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:52.174
Even when I'm with the other ladies, he only says that to me.

419
00:22:53.273 --> 00:22:55.503
I guess you look the most gullible.

420
00:22:56.414 --> 00:22:57.644
No.

421
00:22:57.844 --> 00:22:59.944
He's saying that because I really am pretty.

422
00:23:01.884 --> 00:23:04.414
He always showed up around here.

423
00:23:20.334 --> 00:23:22.104
You look pretty today, as always.

424
00:23:23.703 --> 00:23:24.733
Well...

425
00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:26.203
Thank you.

426
00:23:26.203 --> 00:23:28.074
If you don't mind,

427
00:23:28.404 --> 00:23:30.013
could we talk for a moment?

This is an English study book for kids.

It's a bestseller in Gangnam.

431
00:23:46.463 --> 00:23:49.263
Because you're so pretty and seem to be interested in education,

I'll give you a 50 percent discount.

433
00:23:51.864 --> 00:23:54.303
Gosh, it's like I'm giving it to you for free.

434
00:23:54.434 --> 00:23:57.733
Goodness, you have such nice skin.

435
00:23:57.733 --> 00:23:59.473
It's glowing.

436
00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:02.043
It's blinding my eyes.

437
00:24:02.043 --> 00:24:03.374
You're so perfect.

438
00:24:03.374 --> 00:24:05.213
It's a bestseller in Gangnam.

Because you're so pretty and seem to be interested in education,

440

I'll give you a 50 percent discount.

441
00:24:11.453 --> 00:24:14.884
By the way, you have such nice skin.

442
00:24:14.884 --> 00:24:16.753
It's like a baby's skin.

443
00:24:17.753 --> 00:24:20.763
Gosh, there are so many pretty ladies in the neighborhood.

444
00:24:20.763 --> 00:24:22.223
I thought you were the only one.

445
00:24:23.463 --> 00:24:25.664
Anyway that guy is handsome...

446
00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:26.733
and so good at sales.

447
00:24:26.733 --> 00:24:27.834
He'll make it big.

448
00:24:28.303 --> 00:24:30.473
Let's go home, pretty lady number one.

449

- Guys. - Yes?

450
00:24:41.344 --> 00:24:44.184
I'm really pretty, aren't I?

451
00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:52.094
Let's go.

452

You need a beating.

Yes, the apocalypse.

00:25:22.253 --> 00:25:24.624
Who believes that?

464
00:25:24.993 --> 00:25:26.094
Did you choose?

465
00:25:26.194 --> 00:25:28.023
What? Choose what?

466
00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:30.394
July 24, the final moment.

467

What will you do?

468
00:25:32.293 --> 00:25:35.934
Gosh. Don't believe that. It's a lie.

469
00:25:36.033 --> 00:25:37.203
It's not a lie.

470
00:25:37.203 --> 00:25:39.604
Hey, the planets are all lined up.

471
00:25:39.604 --> 00:25:41.344
There will be an apocalypse.

The planets will collide, and we'll all die.

There's a rumor that there will be a world war.

474
00:25:45.013 --> 00:25:47.144
They say the abnormal change of weather...

475
00:25:47.144 --> 00:25:50.283
is controlled by someone in order to decrease the population.

476

We'll all die. There will be nobody left.

Goodness, she looked very slow,

Hey.

507
00:27:15.864 --> 00:27:17.634
Please take this.

508
00:27:17.773 --> 00:27:18.874
Okay.

509
00:27:20.874 --> 00:27:21.904
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:26.114
Gosh, you're...

511
00:27:26.813 --> 00:27:28.513
too nice.

512
00:27:28.743 --> 00:27:30.114
Don't be mad.

513
00:27:30.354 --> 00:27:31.553
He didn't do it on purpose.

514
00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:44.194
I told you you'd be dead.

515
00:27:50.334 --> 00:27:51.773
Without the glasses,

516
00:27:51.773 --> 00:27:53.543
it would've sprayed right on his face.

517
00:27:53.543 --> 00:27:55.043
That's too bad.

518
00:28:00.384 --> 00:28:01.384
(Ramyeon, 80 cents)

519
00:28:02.043 --> 00:28:03.453
(Meal, 1 dollar 50 cents)

520
00:28:03.453 --> 00:28:05.753
Amazing. 1 dollar 50 cents?

521
00:28:06.424 --> 00:28:08.384
A meal is a dollar fifty?

522
00:28:09.953 --> 00:28:11.793
That's really cheap.

523
00:28:11.924 --> 00:28:13.723
- What? - That's a bag of chips.

524
00:28:15.164 --> 00:28:16.164
Hey.

525
00:28:18.533 --> 00:28:20.063
(The director should explain himself!)

526
00:28:21.203 --> 00:28:22.533
(Why did the price increase?)

527
00:28:22.533 --> 00:28:25.634
(The director should explain the increase in meal price!)

528
00:28:29.104 --> 00:28:30.844
Are your chips made of gold?

529
00:28:30.844 --> 00:28:32.644
What do you mean by a bag of chips?

530
00:28:48.364 --> 00:28:49.424
It's delicious.

531
00:28:49.733 --> 00:28:50.733
It's good.

532
00:28:54.104 --> 00:28:55.334
Why aren't you eating?

533
00:28:55.963 --> 00:28:57.674
I am. Eat up.

534
00:29:10.453 --> 00:29:11.783
I'm full.

535
00:29:12.154 --> 00:29:13.154
You're full?

536
00:29:13.324 --> 00:29:15.523
- I'll take that. - I'll eat that.

537
00:29:19.594 --> 00:29:20.924
I don't have an appetite.

538
00:29:29.703 --> 00:29:30.973
How's the short rib soup?

539
00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:33.174
Let me try it.

540
00:29:39.574 --> 00:29:41.543
It tastes good because...

541
00:29:41.543 --> 00:29:43.253
they boil it in a huge pot for a long time.

542
00:29:43.253 --> 00:29:45.553
It doesn't taste like this when I make it at home.

543
00:29:45.553 --> 00:29:46.824
Did you starve for a few days?

544
00:29:46.824 --> 00:29:48.654
You usually don't eat other people's food.

545
00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:50.723
Why are you eating so fast?

546
00:29:51.124 --> 00:29:53.364
You'll understand when you have a kid.

547
00:29:53.364 --> 00:29:54.364
What?

548
00:29:57.664 --> 00:29:58.664
A kid?

549
00:30:00.434 --> 00:30:01.434
No.

550
00:30:01.434 --> 00:30:03.174
It's nothing.

551
00:30:03.473 --> 00:30:04.574
Eat up.

552
00:30:04.574 --> 00:30:06.604
It's so delicious when you mix them up.

553
00:30:09.104 --> 00:30:10.513
I'm so full I'm about to burst.

554
00:30:11.074 --> 00:30:12.174
I had such a great meal.

555
00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:15.283
You said you were going to eat less because you don't like feeling full.

556
00:30:15.644 --> 00:30:17.553
Being full is a good thing.

557
00:30:18.013 --> 00:30:19.884
It's so sad when you can't eat...

558
00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:22.453
because you have to take care of your baby.

559
00:30:22.753 --> 00:30:23.924
What?

560
00:30:27.263 --> 00:30:28.293
That's right.

561
00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:29.694
It's about time you change too.

562
00:30:30.434 --> 00:30:31.563
It was the right decision to make.

563
00:30:33.533 --> 00:30:35.134
Yes, all right.

564
00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:43.374
What will we do after lunch today?

565
00:30:44.813 --> 00:30:46.614
Why do you ask as if you don't know?

566
00:30:46.743 --> 00:30:48.144
What are we doing?

567
00:30:50.553 --> 00:30:53.013
We have a meeting.

568
00:30:53.013 --> 00:30:54.084
Meeting.

569
00:30:54.324 --> 00:30:56.654
Meeting? We're meeting girls?

570
00:30:56.793 --> 00:30:57.793
What's wrong with you?

571
00:30:59.394 --> 00:31:00.594
Yes!

572
00:31:04.993 --> 00:31:06.233
Why do I have to see him again?

573
00:31:06.503 --> 00:31:08.703
Gosh, let's not get involved with him.

574
00:31:12.374 --> 00:31:13.574
Ma Jin Joo.

575
00:31:14.444 --> 00:31:16.513
Let's stop meeting each other so often.

576
00:31:35.723 --> 00:31:36.934
Why is she here?

577
00:31:37.664 --> 00:31:39.594
What is this? Is this...

578
00:31:40.104 --> 00:31:41.334
Is this the first day I met her?

579
00:31:41.334 --> 00:31:43.233
Is this the first day I met him?

580
00:31:46.003 --> 00:31:49.344
Let's see how many of you can become couples.

581
00:31:55.114 --> 00:31:56.184
Hey,

582
00:31:56.313 --> 00:31:58.553
are they raising seagulls on their eyebrows?

583
00:31:59.654 --> 00:32:00.723
And did they do...

584
00:32:01.124 --> 00:32:03.293
something to their lips together?

585
00:32:06.053 --> 00:32:07.594
Did you invite that bomb?

586
00:32:10.263 --> 00:32:11.364
Did you see their hair?

587
00:32:11.834 --> 00:32:13.104
They are like traffic lights.

588
00:32:13.434 --> 00:32:15.063
Red, green... What is that?

589
00:32:15.263 --> 00:32:16.803
He's the worst of them all. Look at him.

590
00:32:17.604 --> 00:32:18.874
Gosh, he surprised me.

591
00:32:18.973 --> 00:32:20.303
- Gosh. - Gosh.

592
00:32:22.803 --> 00:32:26.313
Yes, this is where I met her.

593
00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:28.884
Why did it have to be today?

594
00:32:29.084 --> 00:32:31.414
No, it's a good thing.

595
00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:33.154
All I have to do is avoid her.

596
00:32:33.453 --> 00:32:34.684
Forever.

597
00:32:35.983 --> 00:32:38.154
Why am I having a nightmare?

598
00:32:38.324 --> 00:32:42.023
I've cursed this day and moment for the rest of my life,

599
00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:43.334
baby.

600
00:32:43.493 --> 00:32:44.963
Let's not get involved with her.

601
00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.094
Let's not get involved with him.

602
00:32:46.094 --> 00:32:47.303
Let's not get involved with her.

603
00:32:47.303 --> 00:32:48.303
Let's not get involved with him.

604
00:32:55.043 --> 00:32:56.713
You should eat first.

605
00:32:57.874 --> 00:32:58.914
Thank you.

606
00:32:59.713 --> 00:33:01.543
- Gosh. - Gosh.

607
00:33:01.884 --> 00:33:04.184
- Let's not get involved with her. - Let's not get involved with him.

608
00:33:04.553 --> 00:33:06.523
Should we introduce ourselves?

609
00:33:06.824 --> 00:33:08.453
I'm a freshman in civil construction major, Um Won Hee.

610
00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:10.394
It's not pronounced like "mother". It's Won Hee.

611
00:33:12.854 --> 00:33:14.324
I'm a freshman in civil construction major,

612
00:33:14.324 --> 00:33:16.594
and I call myself Kim Won Joon. I'm Lee Dae Young.

613
00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:21.233
I'm Go Dok Jae.

614
00:33:21.803 --> 00:33:23.033
Don't call me Dok Jae.

615
00:33:24.134 --> 00:33:25.834
Call me Go Dok.

616
00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:30.844
I'm Ahn Jae Woo.

617
00:33:31.213 --> 00:33:32.914
I like to listen to the radio,

618
00:33:32.914 --> 00:33:34.684
and my specialty is...

619
00:33:35.813 --> 00:33:37.384
Well, I'm thinking about it.

620
00:33:38.753 --> 00:33:40.253
- There's a cockroach! - Where?

621
00:33:40.253 --> 00:33:41.624
- Where? - Gosh!

622
00:33:43.223 --> 00:33:44.523
Where?

623
00:33:45.654 --> 00:33:47.793
This is my friend's specialty. His speed.

624
00:33:54.364 --> 00:33:55.703
You're funny.

625
00:33:57.674 --> 00:33:59.134
I just need to avoid her.

626
00:34:03.743 --> 00:34:05.344
I'm Choi Ban Do from civil construction major.

627
00:34:06.313 --> 00:34:07.513
I'm 20 years old.

628
00:34:07.713 --> 00:34:09.543
I was born in Byeonsanbando. That's why my name is Choi Ban Do.

629
00:34:12.253 --> 00:34:13.924
I'm always thankful to my parents.

630
00:34:13.924 --> 00:34:15.123
It's a good thing I wasn't named Byeon San.

631
00:34:20.364 --> 00:34:21.393
This is the end.

632
00:34:21.963 --> 00:34:23.634
You're just dung.

633
00:34:23.634 --> 00:34:24.793
A piece of dung.

634
00:34:25.364 --> 00:34:27.134
Now that men are done with introductions,

635
00:34:27.134 --> 00:34:28.833
the women should start introducing themselves.

636
00:34:32.034 --> 00:34:33.603
Let's start with you, Bo Reum.

637
00:34:35.643 --> 00:34:36.974
How did you know my name?

638
00:34:38.674 --> 00:34:39.813
What?

639
00:34:43.683 --> 00:34:46.353
It says over there. It says Yoon Bo Reum.

640
00:34:47.884 --> 00:34:49.284
(Yoon Bo Reum)

641
00:34:51.424 --> 00:34:52.523
Yoon Bo Reum.

642
00:34:53.764 --> 00:34:55.793
Gosh, I could've made a mistake. I didn't even realize I said it.

643
00:34:57.063 --> 00:34:59.134
Gosh, he surprised me. I nearly thought he knew her.

644
00:34:59.494 --> 00:35:01.034
We're the same age, so let's speak informally.

645
00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:03.134
I'm a freshman in history major, Yoon Bo Reum.

646
00:35:07.974 --> 00:35:10.074
Why is he setting himself up for heartbreak?

647
00:35:11.014 --> 00:35:12.313
Don't do it, my friend.

648
00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.313
I'm Chun Sul from history major.

649
00:35:15.944 --> 00:35:17.983
I'm in history major too. I'm Go Eun Bi.

650
00:35:19.824 --> 00:35:21.224
I think I see someone in your face.

651
00:35:22.154 --> 00:35:23.853
You look like Suzy.

652
00:35:24.793 --> 00:35:25.954
Kang Soo Ji?

653
00:35:26.194 --> 00:35:27.293
Kang Soo Ji?

654
00:35:29.194 --> 00:35:31.264
That's not who I meant.

655
00:35:31.433 --> 00:35:33.603
There's someone called Suzy who's young and pretty.

656
00:35:33.963 --> 00:35:35.933
You'll see when you grow up.

657
00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:39.534
No, it can't be.

658
00:35:40.804 --> 00:35:42.344
I'm Seol Hyun from history major.

659
00:35:42.773 --> 00:35:43.873
What?

660
00:35:44.114 --> 00:35:45.244
Seol Hyun.

661
00:35:49.713 --> 00:35:51.683
I'm Ma Jin Joo from history major.

662
00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:05.634
- Choi Ban Do. - What?

663
00:36:05.933 --> 00:36:07.534
You know you're the bomb squad today, right?

664
00:36:07.804 --> 00:36:09.333
Make sure you choose the bomb.

665
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:11.634
What do you mean bomb squad? You're grown up now.

666
00:36:11.704 --> 00:36:12.833
Let's just continue.

667
00:36:12.933 --> 00:36:14.003
Hey.

668
00:36:14.744 --> 00:36:16.344
It's your turn.

669
00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:17.844
My turn?

670
00:36:21.713 --> 00:36:22.784
Wait.

671
00:36:22.913 --> 00:36:24.654
How do I know it's her?

672
00:36:24.654 --> 00:36:26.424
They don't write their names down on their things.

673
00:36:26.824 --> 00:36:28.454
I can't do it if I don't know whose it is.

674
00:36:28.724 --> 00:36:30.654
Don't pretend like you don't know.

675
00:36:31.454 --> 00:36:32.694
It's not your first time.

676
00:36:33.194 --> 00:36:34.393
Do it properly.

677
00:36:57.213 --> 00:36:59.083
Why does she keep staring at me?

678
00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:00.183
It's scaring me.

679
00:37:00.183 --> 00:37:02.884
Did she just pick me as her date?

680
00:37:03.994 --> 00:37:05.654
Gosh, that's right.

681
00:37:05.753 --> 00:37:07.764
She used to like me first.

682
00:37:07.924 --> 00:37:10.163
That's why I ended up like that.

683
00:37:10.634 --> 00:37:11.793
Jin Joo,

684
00:37:12.134 --> 00:37:14.634
I'm sick of you.

685
00:37:14.904 --> 00:37:16.134
Suzy.

686
00:37:16.873 --> 00:37:18.074
Suzy.

687
00:37:18.904 --> 00:37:20.844
Who's going to go first?

688
00:37:23.913 --> 00:37:24.913
All right.

689
00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:42.194
My life is in ruins.

690
00:37:45.433 --> 00:37:46.933
I curse her.

691
00:37:47.204 --> 00:37:49.634
I wish she'd go to the abyss.

692
00:37:50.603 --> 00:37:52.404
Gosh, I'm so pathetic.

693
00:37:53.074 --> 00:37:54.674
I feel so bad for myself.

694
00:37:54.704 --> 00:37:57.444
My life has been ruined because of her.

695
00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:01.784
Yes, Jae Woo. Pick your destiny.

696
00:38:02.444 --> 00:38:03.614
I'll help you.

697
00:38:18.634 --> 00:38:19.733
You picked it up.

698
00:38:20.764 --> 00:38:21.864
The giraffe.

699
00:38:21.864 --> 00:38:23.603
Suzy.

700
00:38:24.974 --> 00:38:26.074
It's mine.

701
00:38:26.174 --> 00:38:27.204
What?

702
00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:29.444
How can this be yours? It's Suzy's.

703
00:38:29.543 --> 00:38:30.844
Even if you like him that much,

704
00:38:30.844 --> 00:38:32.043
you need to follow the rules.

705
00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:34.413
I wear different earrings.

706
00:38:34.784 --> 00:38:36.213
You wear giraffe earrings?

707
00:38:38.083 --> 00:38:39.083
It's hers.

708
00:38:40.454 --> 00:38:41.523
What?

709
00:38:41.523 --> 00:38:43.753
It's hers. It's not mine.

710
00:38:43.753 --> 00:38:45.054
Goodness, you brats.

711
00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:48.063
I heard there were people who wear different earrings.

712
00:38:48.663 --> 00:38:50.933
Shut it. You don't know how this could ruin your life.

713
00:38:51.134 --> 00:38:52.333
You can't choose her, all right?

714
00:38:52.393 --> 00:38:53.463
Shut it.

715
00:39:04.074 --> 00:39:05.373
Look at him now.

716
00:39:10.454 --> 00:39:11.753
There's two left.

717
00:39:11.753 --> 00:39:12.784
It's your turn, Ban Do.

718
00:39:15.384 --> 00:39:16.554
Choi Ban Do.

719
00:39:16.954 --> 00:39:18.194
You're here too?

720
00:39:18.853 --> 00:39:20.793
And yet you ignored me?

721
00:39:21.864 --> 00:39:23.733
Do you want a new life or something?

722
00:39:25.194 --> 00:39:27.103
Why does she keep doing that?

723
00:39:27.404 --> 00:39:30.034
We can't meet like this.

724
00:39:30.204 --> 00:39:31.933
Let's not get involved forever.

725
00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:47.424
I trust you, friend.

726
00:39:47.683 --> 00:39:50.224
I'll return the favor next time.

727
00:40:03.404 --> 00:40:05.873
So you don't want to get mixed up with me.

728
00:40:18.384 --> 00:40:20.083
You traitor!

729
00:40:21.483 --> 00:40:22.683
What?

730
00:40:22.683 --> 00:40:24.694
I got rid of the bomb.

731
00:40:24.694 --> 00:40:26.293
Bomb? Got rid of it?

732
00:40:26.293 --> 00:40:28.663
Hey, does she look like the bomb to you?

733
00:40:29.094 --> 00:40:30.433
The flying pig...

734
00:40:30.433 --> 00:40:32.293
is the bomb!

735
00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:35.563
Gosh, you don't know anything.

736
00:40:35.563 --> 00:40:38.074
The one I picked is the real bomb, a dynamite.

737
00:40:38.074 --> 00:40:39.804
Her personality is terrible.

738
00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:41.244
She's a shopaholic, germaphobe,

739
00:40:41.244 --> 00:40:42.804
and she has anger management issues.

740
00:40:42.804 --> 00:40:44.944
She's the ultimate bomb.

741
00:40:45.273 --> 00:40:48.483
Anger management issues?

742
00:40:49.683 --> 00:40:51.284
What's that?

743
00:40:51.284 --> 00:40:52.913
People who have bad tempers...

744
00:40:52.913 --> 00:40:55.154
and get mad spontaneously.

745
00:40:55.784 --> 00:40:56.793
Well...

746
00:40:57.094 --> 00:40:59.123
How do you know that?

747
00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:01.523
It's because I lived with...

748
00:41:01.864 --> 00:41:02.864
Lived with her?

749
00:41:04.463 --> 00:41:05.963
I mean, I heard it.

750
00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:09.063
Everyone knows except you.

751
00:41:09.063 --> 00:41:10.074
Let's go.

752
00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.304
Really?

753
00:41:15.344 --> 00:41:16.543
Everyone knows?

754
00:41:17.143 --> 00:41:18.643
Then why didn't I know about it?

755
00:41:20.784 --> 00:41:22.983
I don't feel good about this.

756
00:41:23.954 --> 00:41:24.954
Hey.

757
00:41:25.054 --> 00:41:26.683
Still the flying pig isn't...

758
00:41:26.683 --> 00:41:27.683
Hey.

759
00:41:38.893 --> 00:41:41.563
Now that we're all paired up, let's split up.

760
00:41:41.563 --> 00:41:42.704
We'll get going first.

761
00:41:48.974 --> 00:41:49.974
Thanks.

762
00:41:51.143 --> 00:41:52.244
No problem.

763
00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:54.543
We'll get going too.

764
00:41:55.514 --> 00:41:58.713
By the way, where's Dok Jae and his date?

765
00:42:01.123 --> 00:42:02.983
Flying pig?

766
00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:05.594
Hey, are you crazy?

767
00:42:06.864 --> 00:42:10.094
How dare you call me a bomb with a face like that?

768
00:42:16.674 --> 00:42:17.674
Hey.

769
00:42:18.003 --> 00:42:21.003
Jae Woo.

770
00:42:23.913 --> 00:42:24.944
- Jae Woo. - Hey.

771
00:42:24.944 --> 00:42:26.384
Look at me.

772
00:42:30.813 --> 00:42:32.253
I'm going for a drink.

773
00:42:32.654 --> 00:42:33.654
Follow me.

774
00:42:41.194 --> 00:42:42.563
He ignored me before.

775
00:42:42.563 --> 00:42:45.063
What is he trying to do now?

776
00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:47.963
I chose her so I could dump her...

777
00:42:47.963 --> 00:42:49.433
once and for all.

778
00:42:49.503 --> 00:42:50.904
How am I going to dump her?

779
00:42:52.373 --> 00:42:53.773
Aren't you going out?

780
00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:56.974
Pardon? Well...

781
00:42:59.674 --> 00:43:01.413
But...

782
00:43:01.413 --> 00:43:03.713
she looks quite pretty like this.

783
00:43:04.583 --> 00:43:07.623
You should've grown up just like this.

784
00:43:07.654 --> 00:43:08.753
Is he...

785
00:43:09.324 --> 00:43:10.893
trying to get back together...

786
00:43:11.154 --> 00:43:13.163
with me? He's crazy.

787
00:43:13.793 --> 00:43:16.364
No. You're crazy.

788
00:43:16.364 --> 00:43:18.764
You can't. End it here.

789
00:43:21.634 --> 00:43:23.704
Well, Ms. Ma Jin Joo.

790
00:43:24.373 --> 00:43:26.333
Your physiognomy tells me that...

791
00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:29.474
you should be studying.

792
00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:31.574
You're a smart woman, right?

793
00:43:31.574 --> 00:43:34.014
A housewife raising kids and doing chores isn't charming.

794
00:43:34.014 --> 00:43:35.114
Why stay home?

795
00:43:35.114 --> 00:43:37.413
You're hungry all the time when you're home.

796
00:43:37.413 --> 00:43:40.623
So what do you do? You devour your husband.

797
00:43:40.623 --> 00:43:41.683
All right.

798
00:43:41.683 --> 00:43:44.154
You not only devoured me,

799
00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:46.023
but you crushed me too.

800
00:43:46.994 --> 00:43:49.023
So don't think about seducing a guy here...

801
00:43:49.023 --> 00:43:50.494
and getting married.

802
00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:51.994
Go study.

803
00:43:51.994 --> 00:43:53.833
Study hard and become a career woman.

804
00:43:53.833 --> 00:43:56.333
"Gold Miss" is cool, isn't it?

805
00:43:56.603 --> 00:43:57.603
Okay?

806
00:43:57.804 --> 00:43:59.134
What did you just say?

807
00:43:59.273 --> 00:44:01.003
I know.

808
00:44:01.003 --> 00:44:03.574
I know you're upset. I know.

809
00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:04.713
But when you're older,

810
00:44:04.713 --> 00:44:07.114
you'll understand what I mean.

811
00:44:07.583 --> 00:44:08.583
Anyway,

812
00:44:09.114 --> 00:44:11.514
study hard. Good luck!

813
00:44:12.784 --> 00:44:13.784
I'll get going now.

814
00:44:19.623 --> 00:44:23.063
I just want to make sure that you know this.

815
00:44:23.733 --> 00:44:24.733
I...

816
00:44:24.864 --> 00:44:26.864
just dumped you...

817
00:44:27.134 --> 00:44:29.404
very harshly.

818
00:44:37.213 --> 00:44:39.643
My goodness.

819
00:44:41.643 --> 00:44:42.683
Gosh.

820
00:44:49.893 --> 00:44:51.293
I'm a hero.

821
00:44:51.293 --> 00:44:53.123
I saved so many people today.

822
00:44:53.123 --> 00:44:54.264
You said you wanted to study.

823
00:44:54.264 --> 00:44:55.594
Become a doctor or a judge or a prosecutor.

824
00:44:55.594 --> 00:44:57.364
Be whatever you want to be.

825
00:44:59.833 --> 00:45:01.503
Nobody else would've lived with you.

826
00:45:01.503 --> 00:45:03.833
Other men would've divorced you way before I did.

827
00:45:03.833 --> 00:45:05.204
You should know that.

828
00:45:23.393 --> 00:45:24.393
Min Seo Young?

829
00:45:26.194 --> 00:45:28.264
Hey, don't you remember my first love back in college?

830
00:45:28.264 --> 00:45:29.864
Min Seo Young, who majored in dance.

831
00:45:30.534 --> 00:45:32.563
I should've hit on her,

832
00:45:32.793 --> 00:45:34.904
but I too naive back then.

833
00:45:35.534 --> 00:45:37.074
Even if you go back in time,

834
00:45:37.074 --> 00:45:38.773
you won't be able to date Seo Young.

835
00:45:38.873 --> 00:45:40.373
If I go back in time, I'll date her.

836
00:45:40.373 --> 00:45:42.244
Why would I date Jin Joo?

837
00:46:09.804 --> 00:46:10.873
That crazy jerk.

838
00:46:10.873 --> 00:46:12.804
Did he pick me just to say that?

839
00:46:12.804 --> 00:46:14.074
Devour...

840
00:46:15.804 --> 00:46:17.143
Devour my husband?

841
00:46:18.944 --> 00:46:20.643
How dare he speak to me...

842
00:46:20.713 --> 00:46:21.983
That jerk.

843
00:46:22.614 --> 00:46:24.114
Where is he?

844
00:46:29.023 --> 00:46:31.623
You're not the only one who came back.

845
00:46:34.963 --> 00:46:35.963
Excuse me.

846
00:46:41.704 --> 00:46:43.773
You're Min Seo Young, aren't you?

847
00:46:46.944 --> 00:46:47.944
What?

848
00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:51.913
Is that...

849
00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:58.014
I'm sorry.

850
00:46:59.353 --> 00:47:00.353
Hi.

851
00:47:01.983 --> 00:47:03.893
Well... Do you...

852
00:47:05.054 --> 00:47:06.054
know me?

853
00:47:07.694 --> 00:47:08.793
You don't know me?

854
00:47:11.764 --> 00:47:15.704
I kind of know you, but not really.

855
00:47:18.134 --> 00:47:19.474
That means you know me.

856
00:47:20.744 --> 00:47:21.744
What?

857
00:47:56.844 --> 00:47:59.983
You're amazing, Choi Ban Do.

858
00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:02.083
You went straight to your first love.

859
00:48:04.253 --> 00:48:06.983
How did he live with me when he missed her so much?

860
00:48:12.424 --> 00:48:14.123
Is this why...

861
00:48:14.123 --> 00:48:16.933
you showed me a miracle today?

862
00:48:17.933 --> 00:48:19.833
Jin Joo, you lived in vain.

863
00:48:21.204 --> 00:48:22.304
It worked out well.

864
00:48:22.634 --> 00:48:24.404
I'm divorced.

865
00:48:25.574 --> 00:48:27.674
I was able to get closure.

866
00:48:38.454 --> 00:48:39.614
Seo Jin.

867
00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:58.233
Seo Jin.

868
00:49:04.813 --> 00:49:05.873
Seo Jin.

869
00:49:18.623 --> 00:49:19.724
Seo Jin.

870
00:49:22.393 --> 00:49:23.733
It's dangerous.

871
00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:25.594
Come here.

872
00:49:33.844 --> 00:49:35.204
What's wrong with me?

873
00:49:42.983 --> 00:49:44.083
That scumbag.

874
00:49:45.614 --> 00:49:46.824
Scumbag.

875
00:49:48.154 --> 00:49:49.154
Scumbag.

876
00:50:21.224 --> 00:50:23.824
Seongbuk-dong 31, please.

877
00:51:36.224 --> 00:51:37.433
We're here.

878
00:52:13.833 --> 00:52:15.003
At ease.

879
00:52:15.433 --> 00:52:16.574
Fall out.

880
00:52:18.074 --> 00:52:19.433
Hello, Director Jung.

881
00:52:26.583 --> 00:52:28.284
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

882
00:52:30.054 --> 00:52:31.313
You should leave.

883
00:52:31.483 --> 00:52:34.154
We're not normally that friendly to each other.

884
00:52:35.054 --> 00:52:36.924
Watch your mouth.

885
00:52:37.523 --> 00:52:40.324
You should have joined the student council instead of the useless ROTC.

886
00:52:41.924 --> 00:52:43.023
Why...

887
00:52:43.023 --> 00:52:45.034
don't you do everything I tell you not to?

888
00:52:45.364 --> 00:52:47.233
You even chose history major although I opposed.

889
00:52:49.463 --> 00:52:51.373
You should even go on a date now.

890
00:52:53.304 --> 00:52:54.574
That's a great idea.

891
00:53:04.454 --> 00:53:05.554
Gosh, look.

892
00:53:05.983 --> 00:53:07.324
He's so handsome.

893
00:53:10.123 --> 00:53:11.194
Do you...

894
00:53:12.594 --> 00:53:13.824
want to go on a date with me?

895
00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:18.393
- He asked her out. - What is this?

896
00:53:22.534 --> 00:53:23.674
I don't want to.

897
00:53:25.503 --> 00:53:26.744
She's crazy.

898
00:53:26.744 --> 00:53:28.373
- Ma Jin Joo must be crazy. - How dare she?

899
00:53:28.474 --> 00:53:30.174
Why would she reject Nam Gil?

900
00:53:30.174 --> 00:53:31.574
What's wrong with her?

901
00:53:32.043 --> 00:53:33.183
Why?

902
00:53:37.884 --> 00:53:39.724
You smell of sweat.

903
00:53:56.003 --> 00:53:57.333
Fool.

904
00:54:09.244 --> 00:54:10.413
What's wrong with her?

905
00:54:20.663 --> 00:54:24.634
In the movies, they go back on time machines.

906
00:54:25.634 --> 00:54:26.833
If it's not that...

907
00:54:28.534 --> 00:54:29.663
I might go back when I wake up.

908
00:54:31.804 --> 00:54:32.873
Aren't you going to sleep?

909
00:54:35.844 --> 00:54:37.373
No.

910
00:54:37.373 --> 00:54:39.014
I'm not going to sleep.

911
00:54:51.994 --> 00:54:55.224
(To my love, Mom)

912
00:54:56.994 --> 00:54:59.034
(Divorce, time slip, dream)

913
00:54:59.034 --> 00:55:00.933
(A miraculous day)

914
00:55:09.003 --> 00:55:10.213
Mr. Yoo!

915
00:55:16.284 --> 00:55:17.384
Look.

916
00:55:17.913 --> 00:55:19.313
Look. She's so funny.

917
00:55:19.753 --> 00:55:22.023
- She's the funniest one. - I think so too.

918
00:55:25.094 --> 00:55:27.324
What? What is it?

919
00:55:29.123 --> 00:55:31.694
Watch television, or go to your room and sleep.

920
00:55:32.494 --> 00:55:34.304
Why are you doing this to me?

921
00:55:42.603 --> 00:55:45.043
Did I feed her something wrong?

922
00:55:46.313 --> 00:55:48.444
What's wrong with her?

923
00:55:49.614 --> 00:55:51.554
Maybe it's a late puberty?

924
00:55:52.654 --> 00:55:54.083
It can't be.

925
00:55:54.384 --> 00:55:55.583
Don't you remember...

926
00:55:55.784 --> 00:55:58.393
how she was like in middle school?

927
00:55:59.194 --> 00:56:01.563
She can't be experiencing puberty again.

928
00:56:02.694 --> 00:56:03.963
Yes, you're right.

929
00:56:04.733 --> 00:56:05.963
Then what's wrong with her?

930
00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:15.873
It was good to see you,

931
00:56:16.543 --> 00:56:17.713
Mom.

932
00:56:19.713 --> 00:56:20.884
Mom.

933
00:56:22.183 --> 00:56:23.384
Mom.

934
00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:36.194
I'm scared of her.

935
00:56:37.833 --> 00:56:38.893
Me too.

936
00:56:47.574 --> 00:56:48.643
No.

937
00:56:51.014 --> 00:56:52.174
You shouldn't fall asleep.

938
00:56:52.674 --> 00:56:53.784
Don't fall asleep.

939
00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:04.853
No.

940
00:57:04.994 --> 00:57:06.094
Get a hold of yourself.

941
00:57:18.474 --> 00:57:19.574
What is this?

942
00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:21.704
Gosh.

943
00:57:22.373 --> 00:57:23.543
I'm the same as yesterday.

944
00:57:32.114 --> 00:57:34.554
Yes! Yes!

945
00:57:35.054 --> 00:57:36.183
I didn't go back.

946
00:57:44.634 --> 00:57:48.563
(What really happened in 1999)

947
00:57:48.634 --> 00:57:50.603
(Epilogue)

948
00:58:03.114 --> 00:58:04.183
Hey,

949
00:58:04.913 --> 00:58:07.454
are they raising seagulls on their eyebrows?

950
00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:09.523
And did they do...

951
00:58:09.954 --> 00:58:12.224
something to their lips together?

952
00:58:12.793 --> 00:58:13.893
Hey.

953
00:58:14.063 --> 00:58:15.764
Did you invite that bomb?

954
00:58:16.764 --> 00:58:18.393
She's about to explode.

955
00:58:19.764 --> 00:58:21.003
There's two two left.

956
00:58:21.503 --> 00:58:22.603
It's your turn, Ban Do.

957
00:58:24.373 --> 00:58:25.474
Hey,

958
00:58:25.833 --> 00:58:27.304
you know you're the bomb squad today, right?

959
00:58:27.543 --> 00:58:28.674
It's your turn today.

960
00:58:39.183 --> 00:58:41.183
Let me take a picture of you.

961
00:58:41.353 --> 00:58:44.154
Some people here might even get married for all we know.

962
00:58:48.563 --> 00:58:49.563
What are you doing?

963
00:59:10.554 --> 00:59:14.284
(Go Back Couple)

964
00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:17.154
- Give me everything we have. - Gosh.

965
00:59:17.253 --> 00:59:19.393
He's going to cause a big problem.

966
00:59:20.163 --> 00:59:22.194
Do you think I did something to live my life again?

967
00:59:22.364 --> 00:59:23.634
She's like Jeon Do Yeon.

968
00:59:23.933 --> 00:59:26.804
Now that we're back, I'm going to enjoy my life.

969
00:59:26.804 --> 00:59:27.904
Can I have your number?

970
00:59:28.503 --> 00:59:30.003
I told you not to flirt.

971
00:59:30.634 --> 00:59:31.833
I'm sorry.

972
00:59:32.074 --> 00:59:33.974
I didn't know I'd come to a club with you.

973
00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:35.444
Why did you come?

974
00:59:35.574 --> 00:59:37.373
When would I come to a place like this again?

975
00:59:38.643 --> 00:59:40.583
He's the one who's into me.

976
00:59:40.844 --> 00:59:41.983
Doctor Park?
