00:00:08.198 --> 00:00:09.857
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:18.408
- Sir. - Hyun.

3
00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:21.877
I... I can't breathe...

4
00:00:25.423 --> 00:00:27.392
I asked an internal medicine doctor for assistance,

5
00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:29.662
but he's inserting a stent and can't come right now.

6
00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:32.162
- Dr. Kwak, can you examine him? - Yes.

7
00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:34.933
Thanks. I have to get to another patient. Thanks!

8
00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:43.102
- On 3. 1, 2, 3. - 2, 3.

9
00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:48.583
I... I can't breathe.

10
00:00:49.043 --> 00:00:50.812
Hold on. I'll try to make you comfortable.

11
00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:53.513
- Let's get an EKG. - Yes, doctor.

12
00:00:58.153 --> 00:00:59.352
160 over 110.

13
00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:01.363
We can't rule out myocardial infarction.

14
00:01:01.363 --> 00:01:03.263
Let's get a blood test and run an ABGA.

15
00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.333
Give him nitroglycerin. One that dissolves under his tongue.

16
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.333
Yes, doctor.

17
00:01:07.432 --> 00:01:09.833
Sir. Does your chest hurt?

18
00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:11.102
How does it hurt?

19
00:01:15.143 --> 00:01:16.703
Did this happen before?

20
00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:24.052
The EKG looked good.

21
00:01:24.052 --> 00:01:26.152
The blood test and everything came back normal.

22
00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:27.852
The ultrasound was fine too.

23
00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:31.492
I felt like my chest was caving in.

24
00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:32.552
Even now?

25
00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:36.063
Well, I feel better now.

26
00:01:36.423 --> 00:01:37.733
I have your diagnosis.

27
00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:39.262
What do you mean?

28
00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:41.033
When is the deadline?

29
00:01:41.262 --> 00:01:44.173
One on Thursday, one by next Wednesday...

30
00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:47.373
Come to think of it, one already passed.

31
00:01:49.772 --> 00:01:53.173
- What are you trying to say? - The diagnosis is stress-induced...

32
00:01:53.173 --> 00:01:56.283
- It's psychological? - So cut back on your work.

33
00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:00.483
You know I can't refuse.

34
00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:04.352
Do you have two jobs?

35
00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:08.193
You really don't know?

36
00:02:08.392 --> 00:02:11.533
It's not like you lived under a rock or anything.

37
00:02:11.993 --> 00:02:14.732
How could you not know the poet, Seol Jae Chan?

38
00:02:15.832 --> 00:02:17.033
Haven't you ever dated?

39
00:02:17.172 --> 00:02:20.243
"The only thing that is beautiful as it disappears is the sun."

40
00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:23.612
"The only thing that is beautiful to lose in is love."

41
00:02:24.773 --> 00:02:27.512
That's right. That's it. That was great.

42
00:02:28.843 --> 00:02:29.982
Have you never...

43
00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:33.153
had a man recite those things to you?

44
00:02:35.753 --> 00:02:37.093
Tell us.

45
00:02:38.322 --> 00:02:40.563
Have you ever dated or not?

46
00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.662
You'll process his discharge, right?

47
00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:44.362
Pardon?

48
00:02:45.593 --> 00:02:47.063
She hasn't.

49
00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:49.762
She hasn't. Right?

50
00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:52.503
Stop that.

51
00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:56.473
Exercise and rest are the best at relieving stress.

52
00:02:56.473 --> 00:02:59.072
Don't take on every request that you get anymore.

53
00:02:59.072 --> 00:03:00.412
Take it easy.

54
00:03:00.943 --> 00:03:03.713
That way, you can write nice poems for many more years.

55
00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:07.023
Gosh. Okay, I got it already.

56
00:03:07.482 --> 00:03:08.523
How do you...

57
00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:13.123
- nag more than my late wife? - Doctor. Doctor.

58
00:03:13.963 --> 00:03:16.623
- I forgot this. - Okay. Thank you.

59
00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.803
What is that?

60
00:03:20.803 --> 00:03:23.403
I had ordered two different blood tests just in case.

61
00:03:25.303 --> 00:03:26.373
That's odd.

62
00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.602
Why is the platelet volume so low?

63
00:03:32.213 --> 00:03:36.743
- Does anything else hurt? - No, not really.

64
00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:39.783
Right.

65
00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:43.822
Actually, that's probably due to stress as well.

66
00:03:44.952 --> 00:03:46.153
Every so often,

67
00:03:49.822 --> 00:03:51.362
I see blood in my stool.

68
00:03:51.993 --> 00:03:53.493
- Blood? - Yes.

69
00:03:54.232 --> 00:03:55.403
Could it be hemorrhoids?

70
00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:04.943
Hey. Is this really necessary?

71
00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:06.982
It would be good to find out the cause like your chest pain.

72
00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:08.443
It'll put your mind at ease.

73
00:04:13.112 --> 00:04:14.153
Hey.

74
00:04:14.482 --> 00:04:16.053
Aren't you doing it?

75
00:04:16.282 --> 00:04:17.892
That isn't my specialty.

76
00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.892
Please turn around.

77
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.423
Okay.

78
00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:29.762
Cancer?

79
00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:32.373
We'll need to run an in-depth examination to be sure,

80
00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:35.373
but there's a 90-percent chance that it's rectal cancer.

81
00:04:37.373 --> 00:04:38.373
What in the world...

82
00:04:38.972 --> 00:04:41.012
You should call his legal guardian.

83
00:04:41.483 --> 00:04:42.712
He doesn't have one.

84
00:04:45.113 --> 00:04:46.183
How about his children?

85
00:04:46.983 --> 00:04:48.782
It was just him and his wife,

86
00:04:49.152 --> 00:04:51.152
and she passed away 10 years ago from uterine cancer.

87
00:04:54.623 --> 00:04:56.822
The only silver lining is that I have no appointments...

88
00:04:57.892 --> 00:04:59.462
for the next three days.

89
00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:02.563
At least I can be with him.

90
00:05:03.772 --> 00:05:05.832
I'll let you know once his examination is scheduled.

91
00:05:07.443 --> 00:05:08.443
It's best...

92
00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.243
to tell him after we get the results, right?

93
00:05:13.272 --> 00:05:14.413
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:28.623 --> 00:05:30.532
Why do I have to be admitted?

95
00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:33.632
Why? Is something wrong?

96
00:05:33.863 --> 00:05:35.832
Dr. Song doesn't think it's just hemorrhoids.

97
00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:38.202
She wants to run a few more tests.

98
00:05:38.472 --> 00:05:40.443
What about my class tomorrow?

99
00:05:41.272 --> 00:05:42.303
Darn it.

100
00:05:42.702 --> 00:05:44.772
How long will the tests take?

101
00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.882
It's set for 7am, so you'll be done by 9am.

102
00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:49.483
Thank goodness.

103
00:05:49.712 --> 00:05:51.382
I can miss just the morning class.

104
00:05:52.113 --> 00:05:53.152
Gosh.

105
00:05:53.282 --> 00:05:56.222
That's right. Let me use your phone.

106
00:05:56.892 --> 00:05:58.322
I couldn't think straight...

107
00:05:58.322 --> 00:06:00.423
when I was brought here and forgot my phone.

108
00:06:09.363 --> 00:06:10.402
Eun Mee?

109
00:06:11.032 --> 00:06:13.032
Why are you answering your mom's phone?

110
00:06:13.943 --> 00:06:15.142
A game?

111
00:06:15.303 --> 00:06:17.613
You punk. Do you know what time it is?

112
00:06:18.472 --> 00:06:20.582
You should go to sleep.

113
00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:21.983
Why did I call?

114
00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:24.882
Where's my head?

115
00:06:25.413 --> 00:06:29.152
I need to do something tomorrow morning.

116
00:06:30.152 --> 00:06:33.793
Have the kids study on their own, okay?

117
00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:35.892
No.

118
00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:39.433
If I take the 10am boat, I'll be there by 1pm.

119
00:06:54.243 --> 00:06:55.243
Ms. Oh?

120
00:06:56.613 --> 00:06:58.382
I'm Kwak Sung's guardian.

121
00:06:59.183 --> 00:07:00.253
Hello.

122
00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:03.722
How is he doing today?

123
00:07:05.493 --> 00:07:08.392
He was very calm today for some reason.

124
00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:10.993
He seems more alert.

125
00:07:14.663 --> 00:07:15.733
I see.

126
00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.272
Thank you.

127
00:07:29.743 --> 00:07:32.212
(Seoul Daehan Hospital)

128
00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:36.382
Dr. Kim.

129
00:07:37.193 --> 00:07:38.193
Come in.

130
00:07:40.522 --> 00:07:41.592
Why did you...

131
00:07:42.822 --> 00:07:43.993
I wanted to see you.

132
00:07:45.392 --> 00:07:47.163
I may have come because of the acquisition,

133
00:07:47.503 --> 00:07:51.003
but it's only right that I see the person who saved my life.

134
00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.173
I wouldn't say I saved your life. I simply...

135
00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:55.743
I see. I guess you just worked hard during the interview,

136
00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:57.243
and Dr. Song Eun Jae did all the work.

137
00:07:59.743 --> 00:08:01.543
Why did you kick her out?

138
00:08:01.543 --> 00:08:04.882
- Well, as I told you before... - That's right.

139
00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:07.652
She was a whistle-blower.

140
00:08:08.582 --> 00:08:09.952
You kicked out a traitor.

141
00:08:11.522 --> 00:08:13.693
Doctors are still sentimental,

142
00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:17.032
executing traitors in a swift motion like samurais.

143
00:08:17.892 --> 00:08:19.762
Business people like us could never do that.

144
00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:22.233
We need to embrace enemies if necessary.

145
00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:24.572
If we can't work with traitors,

146
00:08:25.032 --> 00:08:26.233
we can't survive.

147
00:08:28.272 --> 00:08:30.472
I envy you. I envy you a lot.

148
00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:45.322
Have you heard? Rumor has it Doosung is acquiring our hospital.

149
00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:47.663
Why are you relaying rumors to me?

150
00:08:48.023 --> 00:08:49.822
Does an assistant professor have nothing better to do?

151
00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:52.633
- Professor. - That's why you lose to Eun Jae.

152
00:08:52.693 --> 00:08:53.702
Eun Jae?

153
00:08:54.403 --> 00:08:55.732
Why are you suddenly...

154
00:09:04.773 --> 00:09:05.872
Hello.

155
00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:10.582
Do we have the results for Seol Jae Chan?

156
00:09:10.582 --> 00:09:11.883
We're still running the tests.

157
00:09:12.013 --> 00:09:14.222
He's an internal medicine doctor from the hospital.

158
00:09:14.222 --> 00:09:17.092
- I'm Kwak Hyun. - I heard.

159
00:09:17.193 --> 00:09:18.352
Well done.

160
00:09:18.793 --> 00:09:19.992
No results yet?

161
00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:22.193
- No, look at this. - It's out.

162
00:09:26.293 --> 00:09:27.862
It's rectal cancer.

163
00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:31.702
It's widely spread.

164
00:09:32.202 --> 00:09:35.002
The liver and IVC (inferior vena cava) too.

165
00:09:35.403 --> 00:09:37.273
What stage is it if it's this advanced?

166
00:09:37.273 --> 00:09:39.742
- Stage four. - What are the options?

167
00:09:39.742 --> 00:09:42.813
There's almost nothing we can do in surgery.

168
00:09:42.813 --> 00:09:44.582
That's not true.

169
00:09:45.383 --> 00:09:47.752
- We can operate. - You can operate?

170
00:09:47.752 --> 00:09:49.383
That's nonsense.

171
00:09:49.383 --> 00:09:51.423
The cancer reached the IVC (inferior vena cava).

172
00:09:51.793 --> 00:09:53.523
Doctor Kang's right.

173
00:09:53.523 --> 00:09:54.663
We must be cautious.

174
00:09:55.193 --> 00:09:58.133
If we act rashly, we could lose him on the table.

175
00:09:58.133 --> 00:10:00.303
That would be the case in any usual OR.

176
00:10:01.102 --> 00:10:03.602
Are you saying you have an unusual approach?

177
00:10:04.002 --> 00:10:06.502
The key point of this operation is whether we can...

178
00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:07.972
excise the cancer in...

179
00:10:07.972 --> 00:10:10.673
the liver and veins, not just the primary cancer.

180
00:10:10.773 --> 00:10:13.842
This is rarely attempted because it's so risky.

181
00:10:13.842 --> 00:10:17.313
I'm considering doing a post-exit hepatectomy.

182
00:10:18.053 --> 00:10:19.852
A post-exit hepatectomy?

183
00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:22.283
That sounds unfamiliar. Is it because I'm from Internal Medicine?

184
00:10:22.283 --> 00:10:24.023
No, I've never heard of it either.

185
00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:27.322
Can you explain what that is in simple terms?

186
00:10:27.322 --> 00:10:29.462
I'll cut off the liver's blood supply,

187
00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.033
take it out of the body to excise the tumor,

188
00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:34.362
then put it back in and reconnect it.

189
00:10:34.362 --> 00:10:37.072
Is that even possible?

190
00:10:37.072 --> 00:10:38.173
In simple terms,

191
00:10:38.173 --> 00:10:41.173
I'm merging liver transplant techniques with a hepatectomy.

192
00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:44.242
What's the success rate? How many patients survived?

193
00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:46.273
- None. - What do you mean?

194
00:10:46.273 --> 00:10:49.482
It's never been done in Korea.

195
00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:52.452
- Do you mean this'll be the first? - Yes.

196
00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:54.252
- You've never done it before? - No.

197
00:10:54.252 --> 00:10:57.553
- And you'll still do it? - It's the only viable treatment.

198
00:10:57.553 --> 00:10:59.222
It's still too risky a...

199
00:10:59.222 --> 00:11:01.622
That surgery is his only option.

200
00:11:02.023 --> 00:11:03.492
He has three months.

201
00:11:04.232 --> 00:11:06.133
He won't last over six.

202
00:11:08.763 --> 00:11:10.372
Call me when you're ready.

203
00:11:10.372 --> 00:11:12.803
I'll brief the patient myself.

204
00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:22.982
A post-exit hepatectomy?

205
00:11:23.342 --> 00:11:26.452
Why is she so confident when she's never done it before?

206
00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:29.252
Because she got a fantastic case.

207
00:11:30.053 --> 00:11:31.293
A case?

208
00:11:31.553 --> 00:11:33.923
Say she pulls off something like this.

209
00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:37.263
It's a matter of time before she's called back to Seoul.

210
00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:14.763
Doctor Kim? It's Eun Jae.

211
00:12:15.362 --> 00:12:18.002
I found a patient that fits the thesis.

212
00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:21.173
I'll send a list of information that I need.

213
00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:22.602
Send it as soon as possible.

214
00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:27.183
Congratulations, Doctor Song. A post-exit hepatectomy?

215
00:12:27.183 --> 00:12:29.242
You have my love and respect.

216
00:12:33.783 --> 00:12:35.352
What did you just say?

217
00:12:37.092 --> 00:12:38.622
She's doing what?

218
00:12:38.923 --> 00:12:42.393
A post-exit hepatectomy? Is that true?

219
00:12:42.992 --> 00:12:45.063
What if she makes a comeback?

220
00:12:56.372 --> 00:12:57.813
Did you tell him?

221
00:12:58.342 --> 00:12:59.443
No.

222
00:12:59.543 --> 00:13:02.612
I want to hear more from Doctor Song first.

223
00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:04.913
Forget about her.

224
00:13:04.913 --> 00:13:07.452
Why don't you get a second opinion?

225
00:13:09.322 --> 00:13:10.793
I think...

226
00:13:11.553 --> 00:13:14.023
she's excessively confident,

227
00:13:14.023 --> 00:13:15.592
and that bothers me.

228
00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:37.752
(Please review the files.)

229
00:13:41.622 --> 00:13:43.752
Hello, how are you?

230
00:13:44.822 --> 00:13:47.423
I just sent you an email.

231
00:13:47.423 --> 00:13:50.663
Hello, doctor. I just sent you an email.

232
00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.163
I just sent it.

233
00:13:55.663 --> 00:14:00.072
Is that so? No, I sent it to a few others. Okay.

234
00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.803
Thanks anyway.

235
00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:03.712
He's my dad's friend.

236
00:14:03.712 --> 00:14:06.112
Sung's friend is my friend too.

237
00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:09.413
Don't worry. I'll make it my first priority.

238
00:14:09.413 --> 00:14:11.452
Okay, please do.

239
00:14:24.092 --> 00:14:25.793
Oh dear.

240
00:14:32.602 --> 00:14:34.742
(Payment)

241
00:14:34.742 --> 00:14:36.972
What took you so long?

242
00:14:36.972 --> 00:14:38.543
Why did you ignore my calls?

243
00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:43.383
Can you get me discharged?

244
00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:46.082
They won't let me go unless a doctor clears me.

245
00:14:48.082 --> 00:14:49.553
Don't just stand there.

246
00:14:49.883 --> 00:14:52.952
It's 11am already. I might miss the afternoon classes as well.

247
00:14:52.952 --> 00:14:54.092
Mr. Seol.

248
00:14:57.992 --> 00:14:59.832
You should call the kids.

249
00:15:00.903 --> 00:15:03.163
I don't think you can leave for a while.

250
00:15:04.572 --> 00:15:05.832
What's going on?

251
00:15:06.903 --> 00:15:08.602
Am I very ill?

252
00:15:09.643 --> 00:15:13.143
What is it? Will I die or something?

253
00:15:29.523 --> 00:15:32.893
Why do I need to be admitted?

254
00:15:34.763 --> 00:15:37.602
I may know nothing about medicine,

255
00:15:37.602 --> 00:15:38.803
but stage four rectal cancer...

256
00:15:38.803 --> 00:15:41.742
is untreatable even by the best of doctors.

257
00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:44.242
No. Doctor Song...

258
00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:49.712
She can do something. She wants to operate.

259
00:15:51.683 --> 00:15:52.952
But you...

260
00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:55.183
aren't so sure.

261
00:15:55.683 --> 00:15:57.523
Why do you say that?

262
00:15:58.622 --> 00:16:00.893
Whenever you were unsure or had doubts,

263
00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:03.633
you would touch...

264
00:16:04.293 --> 00:16:05.862
the back of your neck.

265
00:16:06.193 --> 00:16:08.533
You still have your childhood habit.

266
00:16:10.403 --> 00:16:11.872
I'll get more information.

267
00:16:13.133 --> 00:16:14.202
Hyun.

268
00:16:18.842 --> 00:16:20.283
Sorry for the trouble.

269
00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:22.842
I'm just your dad's friend.

270
00:16:22.943 --> 00:16:24.482
Don't say that.

271
00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:27.852
I just tossed you some bait...

272
00:16:28.222 --> 00:16:30.183
so you'd look out for me.

273
00:16:32.153 --> 00:16:36.722
I can't help it if your dad gets jealous.

274
00:16:36.722 --> 00:16:39.293
As you already know,

275
00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:42.533
I have no one else.

276
00:16:50.712 --> 00:16:53.313
I thought I'd be calm and composed.

277
00:16:55.543 --> 00:16:57.252
I told myself that...

278
00:16:57.252 --> 00:17:00.752
even if I have a terminal illness, I'd stay calm...

279
00:17:00.952 --> 00:17:02.683
as if I was greeting an old friend.

280
00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:05.492
It's not that easy.

281
00:17:10.732 --> 00:17:11.833
I'm...

282
00:17:15.232 --> 00:17:17.833
a bit nervous and afraid.

283
00:17:20.843 --> 00:17:24.113
You'll be fine. It'll be okay.

284
00:17:27.482 --> 00:17:28.843
I'll do my best.

285
00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.212
I can do this.

287
00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:37.083
Hand the case over?

288
00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:39.583
Hand it over to whom?

289
00:18:39.583 --> 00:18:41.683
- That doesn't matter. - Director.

290
00:18:42.052 --> 00:18:45.323
This operation is too risky.

291
00:18:46.252 --> 00:18:49.393
It hasn't been tested or verified which is already a burden,

292
00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:52.193
and the operation range is too large.

293
00:18:54.603 --> 00:18:56.762
We need liver and gall bladder specialists,

294
00:18:56.762 --> 00:18:58.103
a colo-proctologist,

295
00:18:58.603 --> 00:19:01.542
urologist, maybe even a cardiothoracic surgeon.

296
00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:03.173
- Are you aware? - Yes.

297
00:19:03.613 --> 00:19:07.542
However, our doctors have almost no expertise with cancers.

298
00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:08.542
I know that.

299
00:19:08.542 --> 00:19:10.982
Then you should have transferred him already.

300
00:19:10.982 --> 00:19:13.353
There's no doctor to transfer him to.

301
00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:16.383
There are no doctors who can pull this off.

302
00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:20.363
You insist on operating?

303
00:19:21.323 --> 00:19:24.532
- Yes. - You may have to manage everything.

304
00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:25.792
I know.

305
00:19:26.093 --> 00:19:29.032
Based on the patient's age, if the surgery runs...

306
00:19:29.032 --> 00:19:30.272
10 hours.

307
00:19:31.373 --> 00:19:34.802
I'll run a simulation to see if I can finish in 10 hours.

308
00:19:36.913 --> 00:19:38.742
What if you determine that it is impossible?

309
00:19:38.843 --> 00:19:41.542
Then I will give up immediately.

310
00:19:44.312 --> 00:19:47.482
This is Song Eun Jae. May I get a cadaver?

311
00:19:49.153 --> 00:19:51.193
There's an unclaimed corpse?

312
00:19:52.022 --> 00:19:53.153
Thank you.

313
00:19:54.022 --> 00:19:56.933
Hey. Move it, will you?

314
00:20:11.673 --> 00:20:13.943
Will you teach us how to ride?

315
00:20:24.752 --> 00:20:25.923
Dr. Song?

316
00:20:26.693 --> 00:20:28.762
Why? Is something wrong?

317
00:20:28.823 --> 00:20:30.532
Okay. We'll be right there.

318
00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:32.562
Let's go.

319
00:20:32.693 --> 00:20:35.433
- What is it? - You'll see.

320
00:20:36.603 --> 00:20:38.333
(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

321
00:20:41.143 --> 00:20:43.103
I'm sorry for calling you in on your day off.

322
00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:46.212
I couldn't pull out nurses who were working for a simulation.

323
00:20:46.443 --> 00:20:50.812
It's okay. You've got my adrenaline pumping.

324
00:20:50.812 --> 00:20:52.913
Look how excited you are.

325
00:20:52.913 --> 00:20:55.183
It's like you're the one operating.

326
00:20:55.482 --> 00:20:58.093
Let's begin. Moment of silence.

327
00:21:06.163 --> 00:21:07.232
Scalpel.

328
00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:31.693
We will conduct resection and anastomosis of 2cm of the colon...

329
00:21:31.693 --> 00:21:33.522
between the sigmoid colon and the rectum.

330
00:21:50.413 --> 00:21:53.812
A post-exit hepatectomy is possible theoretically,

331
00:21:53.982 --> 00:21:55.883
but I'm not sure if it's realistic.

332
00:21:56.012 --> 00:21:58.913
If it were my family, I'd never suggest it.

333
00:21:59.113 --> 00:22:01.123
The only doctor who was optimistic...

334
00:22:01.123 --> 00:22:02.623
was Dr. Song.

335
00:22:02.623 --> 00:22:05.052
It's the common overconfidence of surgeons.

336
00:22:05.052 --> 00:22:06.353
Be rational.

337
00:22:06.452 --> 00:22:09.323
Pain management is the best treatment.

338
00:22:09.593 --> 00:22:12.532
Help him spend his final days peacefully.

339
00:22:27.683 --> 00:22:28.782
What is it?

340
00:22:29.843 --> 00:22:31.482
You still can't figure it out?

341
00:22:34.153 --> 00:22:35.252
Shall we...

342
00:22:37.423 --> 00:22:39.222
Do you think we should...

343
00:22:39.522 --> 00:22:40.562
Yes?

344
00:22:41.163 --> 00:22:43.193
Should we place our bet...

345
00:22:45.762 --> 00:22:47.232
on Dr. Song Eun Jae?

346
00:23:24.833 --> 00:23:28.272
Should I trust your frightening tenacity?

347
00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:32.443
Because at this moment,

348
00:23:33.373 --> 00:23:35.742
you seem to be the person...

349
00:23:36.413 --> 00:23:37.683
working the hardest...

350
00:23:38.482 --> 00:23:40.252
for the patient.

351
00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:48.663
Doctor.

352
00:23:50.593 --> 00:23:53.833
She completed the simulation in six hours.

353
00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:59.433
Then we have no reason to oppose the surgery.

354
00:24:00.502 --> 00:24:03.272
Sure, if it weren't for the cadaver.

355
00:25:40.502 --> 00:25:43.242
(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

356
00:25:52.353 --> 00:25:55.022
- It's so silly. - Not at all.

357
00:26:06.903 --> 00:26:09.762
What are you doing here?

358
00:26:09.762 --> 00:26:12.633
Shouldn't you greet your old professor?

359
00:26:16.073 --> 00:26:18.242
I asked what you were doing.

360
00:26:18.242 --> 00:26:20.512
Have you never seen a doctor examine a patient?

361
00:26:21.742 --> 00:26:25.982
I'm always moved by your poetry every time I read them.

362
00:26:26.353 --> 00:26:27.752
You're embarrassing me.

363
00:26:28.583 --> 00:26:32.893
Our medical staff will do our utmost for your treatment.

364
00:26:33.193 --> 00:26:35.222
Thank you.

365
00:26:38.693 --> 00:26:40.333
Let's talk.

366
00:27:02.423 --> 00:27:04.353
Are you out of your mind?

367
00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:07.693
You'll do what to this man? You'll operate on him?

368
00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:10.462
I will treat my patient as I see fit.

369
00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:12.333
You mean, "experiment" on him, not "treat".

370
00:27:13.032 --> 00:27:15.732
You're dying to add this to your thesis.

371
00:27:15.802 --> 00:27:18.032
Is adding to my thesis wrong?

372
00:27:18.032 --> 00:27:20.903
The patient must come first before the doctor's goals.

373
00:27:21.073 --> 00:27:22.742
When will you ever become a doctor?

374
00:27:24.242 --> 00:27:26.012
If this were three months ago,

375
00:27:26.212 --> 00:27:29.212
I would've pretended to fall for your tricks. What a shame.

376
00:27:29.212 --> 00:27:31.413
Post-exit hepatectomy has not been tested yet.

377
00:27:31.413 --> 00:27:33.653
- There's always a first. - You may fail.

378
00:27:33.653 --> 00:27:36.123
- Should I be afraid? - Of course.

379
00:27:37.323 --> 00:27:39.222
You should be very afraid.

380
00:27:39.393 --> 00:27:40.762
It may be the first, but this case...

381
00:27:40.762 --> 00:27:42.823
Case, case, case!

382
00:27:42.823 --> 00:27:45.492
How long will you treat a patient like a problem?

383
00:27:46.393 --> 00:27:48.133
He isn't a case, but a person.

384
00:27:48.562 --> 00:27:50.903
If you fail, a person by the name of Seol Jae Chan...

385
00:27:50.903 --> 00:27:52.373
will die.

386
00:27:52.673 --> 00:27:54.173
I told you.

387
00:27:54.443 --> 00:27:57.173
Science makes advancements through failures.

388
00:27:57.173 --> 00:27:59.343
I refuse such a heartless advancement.

389
00:28:00.413 --> 00:28:01.643
Dr. Song.

390
00:28:02.312 --> 00:28:06.012
I cannot accept you as Seol Jae Chan's physician.

391
00:28:31.772 --> 00:28:33.212
(Hospital Ship)

392
00:28:34.282 --> 00:28:36.242
He wants to maintain his dignity.

393
00:28:36.242 --> 00:28:38.552
He wants to finish his life with dignity.

394
00:28:38.552 --> 00:28:41.022
Is that more important than his life?

395
00:28:41.022 --> 00:28:42.952
Even if it isn't Alzheimer's like my father,

396
00:28:42.952 --> 00:28:45.522
the illness can make the person lose their sense of identity.

397
00:28:45.522 --> 00:28:47.163
Do you know what persuasion is?

398
00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:49.163
It's making a person feel a certain way.

399
00:28:49.363 --> 00:28:51.962
I'm here. Mr. Seol. Mr. Seol!

400
00:28:51.962 --> 00:28:53.863
Does the offer still stand?

401
00:28:53.863 --> 00:28:55.903
Eun Jae. You're becoming more and more amusing.

402
00:28:55.903 --> 00:28:57.702
Dr. Song? What is it?
