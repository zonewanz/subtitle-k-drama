1
00:00:22.278 --> 00:00:23.877
Where am I?

2
00:00:24.177 --> 00:00:25.217
What happened?

3
00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:27.147
I'm sure I went through that manhole.

4
00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:31.587
Soo Jin!

5
00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:38.727
Soo Jin!

6
00:00:53.338 --> 00:00:55.647
Soo Jin, are you all right?

7
00:00:57.418 --> 00:00:58.547
Who's that darned...

8
00:00:58.547 --> 00:00:59.948
Pil, let's go. We have to go.

9
00:00:59.948 --> 00:01:01.287
- Why? - That's Jae Hyun's car.

10
00:01:01.287 --> 00:01:02.388
- Really? - Hurry.

11
00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:50.938
(Episode 15)

12
00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:06.218
Soo Jin, are you okay?

13
00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:08.848
What...

14
00:02:09.947 --> 00:02:12.058
What happened?

15
00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:13.417
You must've been shocked.

16
00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:15.558
Did you get hurt?

17
00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:17.197
Pil.

18
00:02:18.357 --> 00:02:20.368
I remember...

19
00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:22.667
what just happened.

20
00:02:26.368 --> 00:02:30.137
Last time I saved you,

21
00:02:31.878 --> 00:02:34.808
but this time you saved me.

22
00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:47.957
- Soo Jin. - Yes?

23
00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:52.028
How do you remember that?

24
00:02:53.327 --> 00:02:56.297
I don't know. I just remember everything.

25
00:02:57.237 --> 00:02:59.737
The same situation happened again.

26
00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:02.968
I fell from the rooftop...

27
00:03:02.968 --> 00:03:04.908
trying to escape from Jae Hyun.

28
00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:07.408
You grabbed me last time.

29
00:03:08.648 --> 00:03:11.218
How did I come back here?

30
00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:15.947
What's going on, Pil?

31
00:03:19.158 --> 00:03:20.558
I believe...

32
00:03:24.297 --> 00:03:26.197
we rode the manhole together this time.

33
00:03:27.868 --> 00:03:28.928
What?

34
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.767
Ride the manhole?

35
00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:22.147
Why on earth...

36
00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:26.118
did you meet Pil?

37
00:04:28.387 --> 00:04:29.387
Were you...

38
00:04:30.527 --> 00:04:32.197
trying to report me?

39
00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:36.428
No way.

40
00:04:38.738 --> 00:04:40.837
You'd never do that.

41
00:04:46.378 --> 00:04:48.147
(Jin Sook)

42
00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:56.748
Hi, Jin Sook.

43
00:04:56.887 --> 00:04:57.988
Jae Hyun?

44
00:04:58.517 --> 00:04:59.988
Where's Soo Jin?

45
00:04:59.988 --> 00:05:02.858
I think she went out for a walk.

46
00:05:03.257 --> 00:05:04.858
I see.

47
00:05:05.327 --> 00:05:06.897
Okay. Please tell her...

48
00:05:06.897 --> 00:05:09.767
to call me when she gets back.

49
00:05:11.637 --> 00:05:12.697
Okay.

50
00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:20.137
Jin Sook.

51
00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:23.108
What? What's wrong? Why the long face?

52
00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:25.077
Soo Jin came by.

53
00:05:25.077 --> 00:05:26.947
She looked really upset.

54
00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:28.517
I called her,

55
00:05:28.517 --> 00:05:29.847
but Jae Hyun answered.

56
00:05:29.947 --> 00:05:32.217
Really? Is something wrong?

57
00:05:32.587 --> 00:05:33.757
I'm not sure.

58
00:05:34.087 --> 00:05:36.228
Do you think she had a fight with Jae Hyun?

59
00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.197
I'm worried.

60
00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:41.097
Lovers' quarrels never lasts long, you know.

61
00:05:41.097 --> 00:05:42.168
They'll make up soon.

62
00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:43.267
Right?

63
00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:45.238
I'm sure it's nothing.

64
00:05:45.238 --> 00:05:46.368
By the way,

65
00:05:46.368 --> 00:05:48.438
I saw Pil by the manhole.

66
00:05:48.438 --> 00:05:49.907
Again? Why?

67
00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:52.077
Is he trying to dig it up again?

68
00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:54.548
He's having a tough time getting over Soo Jin.

69
00:05:55.378 --> 00:05:58.748
It's hard for him to see her married to someone.

70
00:05:58.847 --> 00:06:01.347
He wants to travel back in time.

71
00:06:02.017 --> 00:06:03.387
That's ridiculous.

72
00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:05.517
He must be crazy.

73
00:06:05.517 --> 00:06:06.788
He's insane.

74
00:06:07.228 --> 00:06:08.327
I know.

75
00:06:08.488 --> 00:06:10.697
I think Pil will make a huge trouble soon.

76
00:06:11.097 --> 00:06:12.657
When will he grow up?

77
00:06:21.707 --> 00:06:22.767
Drink this.

78
00:06:23.108 --> 00:06:24.238
Thanks.

79
00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:28.407
Pil.

80
00:06:30.418 --> 00:06:31.548
So you're saying...

81
00:06:32.418 --> 00:06:35.717
that we traveled time through the manhole?

82
00:06:36.548 --> 00:06:37.558
Yes.

83
00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:40.527
Normally, I traveled time alone,

84
00:06:42.157 --> 00:06:43.897
but for some reason,

85
00:06:44.097 --> 00:06:45.957
we rode the manhole together this time.

86
00:06:49.628 --> 00:06:51.967
Even though I experienced it, it's hard to believe.

87
00:06:54.137 --> 00:06:56.007
How can this happen?

88
00:06:56.407 --> 00:06:58.438
I know how confused you are...

89
00:06:59.108 --> 00:07:00.777
right now.

90
00:07:02.207 --> 00:07:04.777
I was confused like you at first.

91
00:07:08.587 --> 00:07:10.017
Anyway...

92
00:07:10.688 --> 00:07:12.918
Jae Hyun was the hit-and-run driver.

93
00:07:13.657 --> 00:07:15.257
It's shocking.

94
00:07:15.988 --> 00:07:17.558
How can he stay by your side...

95
00:07:17.558 --> 00:07:19.697
when he's the one who hit you?

96
00:07:24.197 --> 00:07:25.967
You were right, Pil.

97
00:07:27.808 --> 00:07:28.907
About what?

98
00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:31.837
The assailant for the random attacks...

99
00:07:36.147 --> 00:07:37.847
was Jae Hyun.

100
00:07:41.447 --> 00:07:42.918
How did you find out?

101
00:07:46.587 --> 00:07:48.228
I found...

102
00:07:49.257 --> 00:07:53.358
the mask, cap, and clothes I saw on the news...

103
00:07:53.798 --> 00:07:56.967
in Jae Hyun's car trunk.

104
00:08:00.738 --> 00:08:02.137
I knew then...

105
00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:06.077
that he was the assailant.

106
00:08:10.007 --> 00:08:12.118
That's why I called you.

107
00:08:13.378 --> 00:08:15.347
I figured I needed your help.

108
00:08:19.788 --> 00:08:21.087
What should we do now?

109
00:08:22.928 --> 00:08:25.858
Should we report Jae Hyun to the police?

110
00:08:26.428 --> 00:08:27.467
No.

111
00:08:28.498 --> 00:08:31.637
I want to wrap my head around it first.

112
00:08:32.597 --> 00:08:34.367
I'm just too overwhelmed.

113
00:08:35.408 --> 00:08:37.178
I can't make any decisions right now.

114
00:08:40.847 --> 00:08:41.908
Okay.

115
00:08:43.278 --> 00:08:45.717
Let's think about what we're going to do.

116
00:08:46.178 --> 00:08:47.188
Okay.

117
00:08:55.188 --> 00:08:57.197
I'll take that. Be careful.

118
00:09:16.008 --> 00:09:18.117
(Yangyang 65km, Gangneung 12km)

119
00:09:25.457 --> 00:09:26.518
Uncle!

120
00:09:28.158 --> 00:09:29.888
- Uncle! - Who is it?

121
00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:33.058
Who the heck is it?

122
00:09:33.727 --> 00:09:35.668
What? Pil?

123
00:09:35.668 --> 00:09:37.997
- It's me, Uncle. - Hey.

124
00:09:37.997 --> 00:09:40.668
Why are you here this late?

125
00:09:42.068 --> 00:09:43.068
- What? - Hi.

126
00:09:43.138 --> 00:09:45.408
Wait. I know you.

127
00:09:45.408 --> 00:09:48.678
You're Pil's friend...

128
00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:50.818
Hello. You remember.

129
00:09:50.818 --> 00:09:52.918
Of course, I do.

130
00:09:52.918 --> 00:09:55.918
Pil used to follow you around...

131
00:09:55.918 --> 00:09:57.087
all the time.

132
00:09:57.087 --> 00:09:59.957
You don't have to bring that up.

133
00:09:59.957 --> 00:10:00.957
That was a long time ago.

134
00:10:00.957 --> 00:10:04.997
By the way, why are you here so late?

135
00:10:04.997 --> 00:10:07.727
- Well... - I see.

136
00:10:08.127 --> 00:10:11.197
I guess you guys are finally going out.

137
00:10:13.337 --> 00:10:15.967
Are you on a night trip to see the beach?

138
00:10:16.038 --> 00:10:17.938
No, it's not like that.

139
00:10:17.938 --> 00:10:20.408
We were in the area for some other business.

140
00:10:21.207 --> 00:10:23.548
Uncle. Can you let us sleep over?

141
00:10:23.548 --> 00:10:24.877
What? Sleep over?

142
00:10:24.877 --> 00:10:26.847
Of course. Come in.

143
00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:29.347
Uncle, do you have a first aid kit?

144
00:10:29.347 --> 00:10:30.558
First aid kit?

145
00:10:31.087 --> 00:10:33.158
Why? Did someone get hurt?

146
00:10:40.367 --> 00:10:41.367
Does it hurt a lot?

147
00:10:42.127 --> 00:10:43.898
Should we go to the hospital?

148
00:10:45.597 --> 00:10:47.638
I think it's more serious than we think.

149
00:10:47.638 --> 00:10:49.508
It's not that serious.

150
00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:51.638
I can do it.

151
00:10:51.638 --> 00:10:53.577
Stay still. I'll do it.

152
00:10:54.607 --> 00:10:55.607
Wait.

153
00:10:59.577 --> 00:11:01.347
Look at this.

154
00:11:01.347 --> 00:11:02.447
It'll leave a scar.

155
00:11:04.888 --> 00:11:06.558
If it hurts too much, let me know.

156
00:11:06.558 --> 00:11:08.758
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?

157
00:11:14.668 --> 00:11:15.668
Hold on.

158
00:11:17.138 --> 00:11:19.337
You got hurt too.

159
00:11:19.568 --> 00:11:21.068
It's pretty bad.

160
00:11:21.068 --> 00:11:22.467
Didn't you know?

161
00:11:23.568 --> 00:11:25.077
Goodness.

162
00:11:31.747 --> 00:11:33.217
Oh, no.

163
00:11:38.288 --> 00:11:39.418
You must've gotten this...

164
00:11:39.418 --> 00:11:41.227
when you rolled over to save me a while ago.

165
00:11:44.428 --> 00:11:45.428
I guess so.

166
00:11:45.597 --> 00:11:47.898
Take care of yourself before you...

167
00:11:47.898 --> 00:11:49.398
take care of me from now on.

168
00:11:50.997 --> 00:11:52.597
It's upsetting to see you...

169
00:11:53.068 --> 00:11:54.268
get hurt because of me.

170
00:11:58.077 --> 00:11:59.678
Gosh, it must hurt a lot.

171
00:12:14.388 --> 00:12:17.227
This much first-aid should be enough.

172
00:12:18.357 --> 00:12:20.097
Let's go to a hospital tomorrow...

173
00:12:20.298 --> 00:12:21.497
if it gets worse.

174
00:12:22.467 --> 00:12:23.467
Okay.

175
00:12:28.867 --> 00:12:29.867
By the way,

176
00:12:30.908 --> 00:12:33.308
shouldn't you call your parents?

177
00:12:33.308 --> 00:12:35.778
Oh, right. I should.

178
00:12:36.508 --> 00:12:37.518
My...

179
00:12:38.518 --> 00:12:39.518
What?

180
00:12:39.947 --> 00:12:41.048
Where's my cellphone?

181
00:12:42.217 --> 00:12:44.288
I think I dropped it somewhere.

182
00:12:44.617 --> 00:12:46.087
Let me use your cellphone.

183
00:12:46.117 --> 00:12:47.127
Okay.

184
00:12:49.028 --> 00:12:50.058
Thanks.

185
00:12:54.367 --> 00:12:56.367
(My Precious)

186
00:13:12.847 --> 00:13:15.018
(Pil)

187
00:13:26.528 --> 00:13:27.597
Hello?

188
00:13:28.827 --> 00:13:30.068
Hello?

189
00:13:31.467 --> 00:13:33.268
Did you pick up this phone by any chance?

190
00:13:33.967 --> 00:13:35.308
Hello?

191
00:13:36.168 --> 00:13:37.237
Hello?

192
00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:43.778
What's wrong?

193
00:13:44.648 --> 00:13:45.648
I don't know.

194
00:13:46.278 --> 00:13:48.117
They listened without saying anything...

195
00:13:48.117 --> 00:13:49.117
and hung up.

196
00:13:51.518 --> 00:13:52.617
Kang Soo Jin.

197
00:13:54.327 --> 00:13:57.357
So are you really going to spend the night with him?

198
00:13:58.097 --> 00:14:00.227
Hey. Who are you?

199
00:14:00.497 --> 00:14:02.398
You can't set a fire here.

200
00:14:02.398 --> 00:14:05.038
What if it spreads to the construction materials?

201
00:14:05.138 --> 00:14:06.697
Who are you?

202
00:14:06.967 --> 00:14:08.607
Goodness.

203
00:14:26.117 --> 00:14:27.127
Here.

204
00:14:28.788 --> 00:14:31.997
Fortunately, my uncle washed these blankets.

205
00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:35.627
He always keeps things clean and neat.

206
00:14:36.227 --> 00:14:38.798
Pil, you need to go get some sleep too.

207
00:14:38.798 --> 00:14:40.138
I'll do the rest.

208
00:14:40.138 --> 00:14:41.737
All right.

209
00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:44.308
- Good night. - Good night.

210
00:14:45.837 --> 00:14:48.207
What? What's going on?

211
00:14:49.048 --> 00:14:50.418
Did the power go off?

212
00:15:00.658 --> 00:15:03.758
- I'll go see... - Wait, don't go.

213
00:15:03.758 --> 00:15:06.197
Pil, don't go. I'm scared.

214
00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.568
- Don't go. - But I still need to...

215
00:15:08.568 --> 00:15:12.097
Hold on. Let me go with you then. I'm scared.

216
00:15:12.097 --> 00:15:13.837
- Okay. Let's go together. - Pil.

217
00:15:20.577 --> 00:15:21.607
It's on again.

218
00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.678
- You're right. - It went on.

219
00:15:24.678 --> 00:15:25.678
My gosh.

220
00:15:25.678 --> 00:15:26.947
Thank goodness.

221
00:15:27.788 --> 00:15:29.418
Get some rest now.

222
00:15:29.418 --> 00:15:30.418
Well...

223
00:15:30.518 --> 00:15:34.127
Where will you sleep by the way?

224
00:15:34.127 --> 00:15:36.727
I'll sleep somewhere over there.

225
00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:38.857
Okay, goodnight.

226
00:15:38.957 --> 00:15:40.127
- Bye. - Bye.

227
00:15:42.268 --> 00:15:44.497
Goodness.

228
00:15:47.638 --> 00:15:48.737
Are you okay?

229
00:16:04.758 --> 00:16:05.818
Soo Jin.

230
00:16:06.188 --> 00:16:07.188
What?

231
00:16:09.957 --> 00:16:10.997
Should we just...

232
00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:13.898
stay here instead of going back to Seoul?

233
00:16:17.197 --> 00:16:18.268
What are you...

234
00:16:18.898 --> 00:16:20.638
talking about all of a sudden?

235
00:16:21.768 --> 00:16:22.768
Well...

236
00:16:23.508 --> 00:16:24.508
It's just...

237
00:16:24.908 --> 00:16:26.908
that I don't want to be apart from you.

238
00:16:40.087 --> 00:16:43.798
Tell me if you need anything else.

239
00:16:44.857 --> 00:16:46.898
I'll go buy some stuff at the convenience store.

240
00:16:47.227 --> 00:16:48.367
Rest here.

241
00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:50.127
Okay.

242
00:17:09.687 --> 00:17:12.357
Why did you say you didn't want to go back to Seoul?

243
00:17:15.058 --> 00:17:16.458
Wake up, Pil.

244
00:17:31.482 --> 00:17:34.714
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 15 Manhole "Turn Yourself In"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

245
00:17:47.728 --> 00:17:48.788
Soo Jin.

246
00:20:23.478 --> 00:20:24.478
Soo Jin.

247
00:20:31.758 --> 00:20:32.758
Soo Jin.

248
00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.208
Pil.

249
00:20:53.708 --> 00:20:57.077
When you warned me that Jae Hyun was dangerous,

250
00:20:57.077 --> 00:20:58.617
why didn't I trust you?

251
00:21:00.048 --> 00:21:02.248
If I had listened to you at least once,

252
00:21:03.018 --> 00:21:05.258
things wouldn't have ended up this way.

253
00:21:07.127 --> 00:21:09.127
You didn't have a choice.

254
00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:12.157
He's the guy you chose.

255
00:21:13.127 --> 00:21:14.728
I'm sure you wanted to trust him.

256
00:21:18.468 --> 00:21:20.167
As I traveled through time,

257
00:21:20.867 --> 00:21:24.208
I came to realize that he wasn't a good man.

258
00:21:25.177 --> 00:21:26.308
But...

259
00:21:27.278 --> 00:21:29.008
no matter how the situation turns out,

260
00:21:30.077 --> 00:21:32.448
you just got closer and closer to him.

261
00:21:33.347 --> 00:21:35.988
I didn't know how I could bring this up.

262
00:21:39.058 --> 00:21:40.587
In order to convince you that I'm right,

263
00:21:41.427 --> 00:21:44.357
I knew I had to tell you that I have been...

264
00:21:44.357 --> 00:21:45.528
traveling through time.

265
00:21:47.427 --> 00:21:49.468
But there was no way you would believe that.

266
00:21:51.068 --> 00:21:52.768
That was the most frustrating.

267
00:21:56.367 --> 00:21:57.677
I get it now.

268
00:22:00.847 --> 00:22:02.508
It must've been...

269
00:22:03.048 --> 00:22:05.048
really frustrating and difficult for you.

270
00:22:08.347 --> 00:22:09.448
Pil.

271
00:22:10.248 --> 00:22:11.788
What on earth happened...

272
00:22:12.218 --> 00:22:14.187
as you traveled through time?

273
00:22:18.127 --> 00:22:19.597
A lot of things happened.

274
00:22:20.198 --> 00:22:21.927
You just don't know what they are.

275
00:22:24.397 --> 00:22:26.437
Whenever you were in danger,

276
00:22:26.937 --> 00:22:28.367
I saved you.

277
00:22:29.068 --> 00:22:31.177
Once I was unconscious...

278
00:22:31.177 --> 00:22:33.907
and spoke with you as a spirit.

279
00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:36.147
Come on.

280
00:22:40.117 --> 00:22:41.818
You might not remember,

281
00:22:41.917 --> 00:22:44.117
but you even asked me to marry you.

282
00:22:44.318 --> 00:22:46.788
Did I? Really?

283
00:22:46.788 --> 00:22:47.857
Yes.

284
00:22:49.627 --> 00:22:52.597
But after I got into the manhole again,

285
00:22:52.597 --> 00:22:54.867
everything that happened disappeared,

286
00:22:56.327 --> 00:22:59.198
and you and I grew further apart from each other.

287
00:23:07.877 --> 00:23:09.907
Do you see that temporary building?

288
00:23:12.948 --> 00:23:15.448
That building was on fire,

289
00:23:17.488 --> 00:23:19.718
and you were in it.

290
00:23:22.087 --> 00:23:23.998
I went in to save you...

291
00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:27.228
and almost died.

292
00:23:30.097 --> 00:23:31.198
And what?

293
00:23:32.038 --> 00:23:33.468
Did you save me?

294
00:23:33.468 --> 00:23:35.568
Of course, I did.

295
00:23:37.377 --> 00:23:39.637
Then I went into a coma,

296
00:23:41.077 --> 00:23:42.647
and I had to go around as a spirit.

297
00:23:44.177 --> 00:23:46.048
Why did you do that, you fool?

298
00:23:47.647 --> 00:23:50.318
You shouldn't risk your life to save me.

299
00:23:51.218 --> 00:23:52.417
I'm sure...

300
00:23:52.917 --> 00:23:55.687
you never heard me thank you for that either.

301
00:23:57.127 --> 00:23:59.327
I didn't do that to patronize you.

302
00:24:01.167 --> 00:24:03.528
I was always willing to risk my life for you.

303
00:24:03.528 --> 00:24:04.738
Ever since we were young.

304
00:24:13.107 --> 00:24:14.248
But...

305
00:24:15.508 --> 00:24:18.778
do you know when I was the most frustrated?

306
00:24:24.488 --> 00:24:27.958
I don't think I can say this to your face.

307
00:24:28.427 --> 00:24:30.627
So I'm leaving a message as a video.

308
00:24:31.657 --> 00:24:32.657
I...

309
00:24:34.367 --> 00:24:35.397
like you.

310
00:24:35.968 --> 00:24:38.538
I have never stopped for a day for 28 years.

311
00:24:40.038 --> 00:24:41.708
I might have skipped a few meals,

312
00:24:41.867 --> 00:24:44.137
but I never stopped liking you. Not even a day.

313
00:24:44.137 --> 00:24:46.978
When you couldn't remember anything when I finally...

314
00:24:48.677 --> 00:24:50.347
had the courage to tell you how I feel.

315
00:24:50.347 --> 00:24:52.417
- I... - I like you, Pil.

316
00:24:54.448 --> 00:24:55.518
What?

317
00:24:57.157 --> 00:24:59.587
And the day when you said that you like me,

318
00:25:00.728 --> 00:25:03.758
but turned very cold when I saw you the next day.

319
00:25:09.867 --> 00:25:11.397
That was heartbreaking.

320
00:25:12.937 --> 00:25:15.208
We finally found out that we liked each other,

321
00:25:16.607 --> 00:25:18.238
but everything was gone...

322
00:25:18.238 --> 00:25:19.877
when I went through the manhole again.

323
00:25:22.647 --> 00:25:24.647
That nearly drove me insane.

324
00:25:29.147 --> 00:25:30.318
You probably...

325
00:25:33.617 --> 00:25:35.587
blamed me a lot for that.

326
00:25:40.298 --> 00:25:41.568
I'm fine now.

327
00:25:44.568 --> 00:25:47.038
Now you and I...

328
00:25:47.038 --> 00:25:49.437
share the same memories.

329
00:25:51.137 --> 00:25:52.577
It feels like compensation...

330
00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:56.647
for all the hard times.

331
00:25:58.948 --> 00:25:59.978
Pil.

332
00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:03.818
I'm sorry that I gave you a hard time.

333
00:26:37.288 --> 00:26:39.187
Report on the victims.

334
00:26:39.558 --> 00:26:41.827
He's been moved to the hospital for treatment.

335
00:26:41.827 --> 00:26:44.397
However, he's not doing that well.

336
00:26:44.397 --> 00:26:46.228
Apparently, he hit him for no reason.

337
00:26:46.357 --> 00:26:48.698
The wound is the worst on his face.

338
00:26:56.308 --> 00:26:57.478
Sergeant Choi.

339
00:26:58.907 --> 00:27:00.677
Hyeong Gi is on his way from the headquarters.

340
00:27:00.847 --> 00:27:01.847
What about the victim?

341
00:27:01.847 --> 00:27:03.478
Undergoing treatments at a hospital.

342
00:27:03.508 --> 00:27:06.048
The victim took a very bad beating.

343
00:27:06.048 --> 00:27:07.248
His face is a complete wreck.

344
00:27:07.248 --> 00:27:08.548
Did he see the assailant's face?

345
00:27:09.018 --> 00:27:10.857
It was too dark, so he isn't sure.

346
00:27:11.117 --> 00:27:13.927
But he said he was tall and young.

347
00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:17.498
Why did this guy burn up so much stuff?

348
00:27:27.308 --> 00:27:28.637
The assailant of that random assault...

349
00:27:28.637 --> 00:27:30.068
- is him. - What?

350
00:27:30.068 --> 00:27:31.937
The ornament which was found at the site...

351
00:27:31.937 --> 00:27:33.907
was part of his key chain.

352
00:27:39.077 --> 00:27:40.387
Suspended?

353
00:27:42.387 --> 00:27:43.448
Yes.

354
00:27:44.558 --> 00:27:45.617
Yes.

355
00:27:47.587 --> 00:27:49.058
Yes, I understand.

356
00:28:00.238 --> 00:28:01.808
Could you prepare some lunch for me?

357
00:28:01.808 --> 00:28:03.538
I have to eat quickly and go.

358
00:28:03.538 --> 00:28:07.107
Honey, Pil has been suspended.

359
00:28:07.407 --> 00:28:08.708
I think he was punished...

360
00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:10.077
for hitting Soo Jin's husband.

361
00:28:11.917 --> 00:28:13.417
Goodness, this is only getting worse.

362
00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:15.417
And I don't see our car outside.

363
00:28:15.417 --> 00:28:17.117
He must've taken it.

364
00:28:17.117 --> 00:28:18.357
Did he suddenly go on a trip...

365
00:28:18.357 --> 00:28:20.018
because he was angry about his suspension?

366
00:28:20.018 --> 00:28:22.988
But still, he should tell us where he's going.

367
00:28:28.427 --> 00:28:31.038
- Goodness. - I don't believe this.

368
00:28:32.937 --> 00:28:36.008
Pil finally ended up causing trouble.

369
00:28:36.008 --> 00:28:38.437
Pil took Soo Jin away last night,

370
00:28:38.437 --> 00:28:39.738
and we haven't heard from her since.

371
00:28:39.738 --> 00:28:41.647
What are you talking about?

372
00:28:41.647 --> 00:28:44.677
Can you explain this so I could understand?

373
00:28:44.677 --> 00:28:48.347
Pil abducted Soo Jin. He abducted her!

374
00:28:48.847 --> 00:28:49.887
Abducted?

375
00:28:49.887 --> 00:28:52.117
Last night, he dragged Soo Jin away...

376
00:28:52.117 --> 00:28:55.327
in front of my son-in-law and took her in his car.

377
00:28:55.327 --> 00:28:56.758
Hasn't he called you two?

378
00:28:56.758 --> 00:28:59.558
What on earth are you talking about?

379
00:28:59.927 --> 00:29:01.298
Give me a moment.

380
00:29:01.327 --> 00:29:03.367
Let me call him.

381
00:29:08.268 --> 00:29:10.778
- Your call cannot be... - He won't pick up.

382
00:29:10.778 --> 00:29:13.107
As soon as I reach him, I will...

383
00:29:13.107 --> 00:29:14.948
How can we wait around for that?

384
00:29:14.948 --> 00:29:16.347
I can't let this go on.

385
00:29:16.347 --> 00:29:18.377
I don't care if they're childhood friends.

386
00:29:18.377 --> 00:29:20.218
I'm going to report him to the police.

387
00:29:20.218 --> 00:29:22.687
Will you please calm down?

388
00:29:22.687 --> 00:29:24.288
I'll find him no matter what it takes..

389
00:29:24.288 --> 00:29:26.558
and bring back Soo Jin safe and sound.

390
00:29:26.558 --> 00:29:29.528
Just please, don't call the police.

391
00:29:29.788 --> 00:29:32.357
Say something! My goodness.

392
00:29:33.528 --> 00:29:35.127
Goo Gil, Jung Ae.

393
00:29:35.127 --> 00:29:36.397
Have either of you seen or spoken...

394
00:29:36.397 --> 00:29:38.367
to Pil or Soo Jin since yesterday?

395
00:29:38.367 --> 00:29:39.667
Or have you seen them?

396
00:29:39.667 --> 00:29:40.708
No.

397
00:29:40.708 --> 00:29:42.708
What is it? What's going on?

398
00:29:42.968 --> 00:29:44.877
Pil abducted Soo Jin.

399
00:29:44.877 --> 00:29:46.808
And he did it in front of Jae Hyun.

400
00:29:46.808 --> 00:29:49.778
Goodness. What are you talking about?

401
00:29:49.778 --> 00:29:53.147
Soo Jin and Jae Hyun were supposed to go to the UK.

402
00:29:53.147 --> 00:29:55.018
But because Pil abducted Soo Jin,

403
00:29:55.018 --> 00:29:56.847
they couldn't go and he doesn't know where she is.

404
00:29:56.847 --> 00:29:58.617
He said he can't reach her either.

405
00:29:58.617 --> 00:30:01.087
Really? What do we do?

406
00:30:01.087 --> 00:30:03.087
Pil must be insane.

407
00:30:03.387 --> 00:30:05.058
That's unbelievable.

408
00:30:05.327 --> 00:30:07.228
Who did you hear this from?

409
00:30:07.228 --> 00:30:09.167
Wait up. I'll call him.

410
00:30:09.427 --> 00:30:11.568
- Unbelievable. - He won't pick up.

411
00:30:11.568 --> 00:30:12.867
He won't pick up.

412
00:30:12.867 --> 00:30:14.008
Give me a moment.

413
00:30:15.607 --> 00:30:17.337
What on earth are they talking about?

414
00:30:18.478 --> 00:30:20.677
Your call cannot be connected.

415
00:30:20.677 --> 00:30:22.948
- Please leave... - He won't pick up.

416
00:30:23.308 --> 00:30:29.018
She was the one whom I loved

417
00:30:30.218 --> 00:30:31.758
- Hello. - Hey.

418
00:30:31.758 --> 00:30:33.087
Are you cleaning up?

419
00:30:33.087 --> 00:30:36.488
Yes, I should get ready to open for business.

420
00:30:36.488 --> 00:30:38.657
Don't you wear your Marine uniform anymore?

421
00:30:38.657 --> 00:30:40.298
Oh, my uniform?

422
00:30:40.298 --> 00:30:43.028
Actually, I recently started dating.

423
00:30:43.627 --> 00:30:45.337
I needed to pull myself together.

424
00:30:45.538 --> 00:30:48.607
Anyway, it's already lunchtime.

425
00:30:48.607 --> 00:30:50.337
You must be hungry.

426
00:30:50.337 --> 00:30:52.607
I think Pil is making a lot of food...

427
00:30:52.607 --> 00:30:55.347
to give to his girlfriend.

428
00:30:55.347 --> 00:30:56.808
You should go over.

429
00:30:57.478 --> 00:30:59.917
Could I have two cups of coffee?

430
00:30:59.978 --> 00:31:01.288
Coffee?

431
00:31:01.288 --> 00:31:04.218
Will you two have it by yourselves?

432
00:31:04.587 --> 00:31:05.758
That sounds great.

433
00:31:06.687 --> 00:31:08.528
- Here you are. - You don't need to pay.

434
00:31:08.528 --> 00:31:09.988
No, it's okay.

435
00:31:09.988 --> 00:31:11.698
You're Pil's friend.

436
00:31:11.698 --> 00:31:14.167
You let me sleep over. Let me pay.

437
00:31:14.167 --> 00:31:17.498
My goodness. It's really okay.

438
00:31:17.568 --> 00:31:19.637
- Wait here. - Okay.

439
00:31:19.637 --> 00:31:21.708
I'll bring it out soon.

440
00:31:25.377 --> 00:31:27.377
Do you want it hot or cold?

441
00:31:27.377 --> 00:31:28.677
Cold, please.

442
00:31:28.677 --> 00:31:30.347
Okay, got it.

443
00:31:32.718 --> 00:31:35.087
Goodness. Pil must...

444
00:31:35.718 --> 00:31:38.988
like you a lot still.

445
00:31:39.657 --> 00:31:41.627
Stop teasing him,

446
00:31:41.687 --> 00:31:43.698
and accept his feelings already.

447
00:31:47.968 --> 00:31:51.498
Uncle, do you have a camera?

448
00:31:51.498 --> 00:31:53.667
If you do, can I borrow it?

449
00:31:53.667 --> 00:31:56.667
Camera? Let's see.

450
00:31:56.667 --> 00:31:58.238
I have an old one.

451
00:31:58.577 --> 00:31:59.907
Wait here.

452
00:31:59.907 --> 00:32:01.048
Thanks.

453
00:32:17.958 --> 00:32:20.528
(Moonlight Cafe Gangneung, purchase approved)

454
00:32:32.377 --> 00:32:33.377
Park Jae Hyun!

455
00:32:34.407 --> 00:32:35.478
Park Jae Hyun!

456
00:32:35.847 --> 00:32:37.147
Park Jae Hyun! Stop!

457
00:32:37.748 --> 00:32:39.778
- Hey! Park Jae Hyun! - Park Jae Hyun!

458
00:32:56.698 --> 00:32:57.937
Why did they come for me?

459
00:33:00.298 --> 00:33:03.107
Did Pil report me?

460
00:33:07.147 --> 00:33:09.177
(Power off)

461
00:33:18.488 --> 00:33:19.488
All right.

462
00:33:21.387 --> 00:33:23.087
It's hot.

463
00:33:26.698 --> 00:33:27.698
Okay.

464
00:33:35.968 --> 00:33:38.038
Pil, what are you doing?

465
00:33:38.038 --> 00:33:40.847
You should be resting, why did you come out?

466
00:33:40.847 --> 00:33:41.907
Thanks.

467
00:33:42.708 --> 00:33:44.478
What are you making?

468
00:33:44.478 --> 00:33:45.847
Chef Bong....

469
00:33:45.847 --> 00:33:48.647
is cooking just for you.

470
00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:50.818
Look at this fried egg. Isn't it amazing?

471
00:33:51.288 --> 00:33:52.488
It looks easy to do.

472
00:33:52.818 --> 00:33:54.887
But it's actually really hard.

473
00:33:57.627 --> 00:33:58.827
Good job.

474
00:34:00.198 --> 00:34:02.998
Pil, shall we eat at the beach?

475
00:34:02.998 --> 00:34:04.068
Sounds great.

476
00:34:05.798 --> 00:34:06.798
Hey.

477
00:34:07.167 --> 00:34:08.508
Where did you get the camera?

478
00:34:08.508 --> 00:34:10.837
I borrowed it from your uncle.

479
00:34:10.837 --> 00:34:12.107
It's nice out here.

480
00:34:12.107 --> 00:34:13.877
So I want to take some pictures.

481
00:34:15.877 --> 00:34:19.078
I'll be your handsome model today then.

482
00:34:20.517 --> 00:34:22.488
Wait just a minute. I'll pack these.

483
00:34:22.488 --> 00:34:24.118
Okay. Take your time.

484
00:34:24.118 --> 00:34:25.118
Okay.

485
00:34:25.718 --> 00:34:28.057
Where's the lunch box?

486
00:34:34.627 --> 00:34:36.627
Gosh, the weather's amazing.

487
00:34:36.727 --> 00:34:38.468
Pictures will turn out great.

488
00:34:38.638 --> 00:34:39.638
I think so.

489
00:34:41.368 --> 00:34:44.008
Hey, your leg must be hurting still.

490
00:34:44.178 --> 00:34:45.837
What? No, it's fine.

491
00:34:47.448 --> 00:34:49.147
Come on. Get on.

492
00:34:50.078 --> 00:34:51.348
Hey, it's okay.

493
00:34:51.348 --> 00:34:54.118
I'm giving you a piggyback because you hurt your leg.

494
00:34:54.118 --> 00:34:56.388
I have a broad back.

495
00:34:56.548 --> 00:34:58.287
- Come on. - Get up.

496
00:34:58.618 --> 00:35:00.857
It's really okay. Get on.

497
00:35:00.857 --> 00:35:03.528
- Hey. - Let's go.

498
00:35:03.727 --> 00:35:06.627
Gosh, why are you so light?

499
00:35:07.127 --> 00:35:08.497
You shouldn't skip your meals.

500
00:35:09.497 --> 00:35:11.667
Hey, Pil. You're so grown up now.

501
00:35:11.667 --> 00:35:13.397
You couldn't carry me before.

502
00:35:13.397 --> 00:35:14.408
When?

503
00:35:14.607 --> 00:35:15.607
Hey.

504
00:35:16.238 --> 00:35:18.178
I carried you in kindergarten.

505
00:35:18.278 --> 00:35:19.807
That was ages ago.

506
00:35:19.807 --> 00:35:22.707
I got muscular after kindergarten.

507
00:35:25.048 --> 00:35:27.888
All right. Hold on tight or you'll fall.

508
00:35:45.368 --> 00:35:46.968
Okay. One more time.

509
00:35:46.968 --> 00:35:49.607
- Goodness. - 1, 2...

510
00:35:53.278 --> 00:35:55.377
Hey!

511
00:35:58.618 --> 00:35:59.618
Put me down.

512
00:36:04.158 --> 00:36:06.787
Put me down!

513
00:36:09.488 --> 00:36:11.798
You hurt your leg.

514
00:36:36.587 --> 00:36:37.587
It's cold!

515
00:36:53.068 --> 00:36:54.307
Goodness.

516
00:36:55.207 --> 00:36:56.968
I got wet.

517
00:37:00.678 --> 00:37:02.607
It looks pretty good.

518
00:37:02.948 --> 00:37:06.218
Of course. I put my soul into it.

519
00:37:06.448 --> 00:37:07.917
So you have to finish it all.

520
00:37:07.917 --> 00:37:10.318
Okay. Let's see how it tastes.

521
00:37:13.218 --> 00:37:14.988
Hey, it's delicious.

522
00:37:15.457 --> 00:37:17.158
You're a good cook.

523
00:37:17.397 --> 00:37:18.758
You'd make a great husband.

524
00:37:18.828 --> 00:37:19.997
I don't cook often,

525
00:37:19.997 --> 00:37:22.667
but when I do I'm amazing at it.

526
00:37:23.198 --> 00:37:25.468
I've never cooked for anyone before.

527
00:37:25.468 --> 00:37:26.667
You should feel honored.

528
00:37:27.568 --> 00:37:29.238
Okay. Thank you.

529
00:37:31.578 --> 00:37:32.578
Pil.

530
00:37:34.377 --> 00:37:35.848
I better...

531
00:37:36.678 --> 00:37:38.718
get back to Seoul today.

532
00:37:39.417 --> 00:37:40.818
Today?

533
00:37:41.687 --> 00:37:42.687
Yes.

534
00:37:44.258 --> 00:37:46.658
I can't stay here forever.

535
00:37:48.388 --> 00:37:50.857
Can't we stay here longer?

536
00:37:50.928 --> 00:37:52.758
I'd be sad to leave.

537
00:37:57.037 --> 00:37:58.037
Here.

538
00:38:03.778 --> 00:38:06.078
I think this will be the last time...

539
00:38:07.948 --> 00:38:09.778
we spend time together.

540
00:38:12.848 --> 00:38:15.287
What do you mean it'll be the last time?

541
00:38:17.917 --> 00:38:21.227
I thought about it after hearing...

542
00:38:21.587 --> 00:38:23.187
your time travel stories.

543
00:38:26.298 --> 00:38:28.727
I don't think we should be together.

544
00:38:30.868 --> 00:38:33.767
You were always in danger...

545
00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:36.537
and suffering because of me.

546
00:38:39.107 --> 00:38:40.778
No.

547
00:38:41.408 --> 00:38:43.647
I never thought of it that way.

548
00:38:44.348 --> 00:38:46.448
I just want to be with you.

549
00:38:46.517 --> 00:38:48.348
That's all I want.

550
00:38:49.388 --> 00:38:50.388
Pil.

551
00:38:51.488 --> 00:38:53.318
I don't want you to be like that.

552
00:38:55.727 --> 00:38:58.098
I don't want you to be miserable...

553
00:39:00.127 --> 00:39:01.767
because of me.

554
00:39:02.568 --> 00:39:03.767
Soo Jin.

555
00:39:03.968 --> 00:39:05.997
You said it never..

556
00:39:06.638 --> 00:39:09.408
worked out between us when you traveled in time.

557
00:39:11.678 --> 00:39:13.107
That's because...

558
00:39:14.307 --> 00:39:16.477
we aren't meant to be.

559
00:39:18.477 --> 00:39:19.718
Look at us now.

560
00:39:21.587 --> 00:39:23.218
I'm already married,

561
00:39:24.618 --> 00:39:26.287
and we can't be together.

562
00:39:29.227 --> 00:39:30.227
Soo Jin.

563
00:39:30.627 --> 00:39:33.057
You know what Jae Hyun is really like.

564
00:39:33.057 --> 00:39:35.598
He's dangerous. You might get hurt.

565
00:39:35.598 --> 00:39:37.738
Deciding not to see you...

566
00:39:39.598 --> 00:39:41.707
has nothing to do with Jae Hyun.

567
00:39:43.607 --> 00:39:45.138
It's just what I decided.

568
00:39:51.618 --> 00:39:52.618
Pil.

569
00:39:54.348 --> 00:39:56.787
I want you to be happy.

570
00:40:00.787 --> 00:40:03.357
I don't know if you'll time travel again...

571
00:40:05.357 --> 00:40:08.468
or if you'll stay here.

572
00:40:09.868 --> 00:40:11.068
But from now on,

573
00:40:12.337 --> 00:40:14.267
regardless of what happens,

574
00:40:16.937 --> 00:40:18.707
don't choose me.

575
00:40:24.377 --> 00:40:25.917
I don't want...

576
00:40:27.618 --> 00:40:29.988
you to suffer because of me.

577
00:40:36.187 --> 00:40:37.557
I'll get going first.

578
00:40:39.028 --> 00:40:40.057
Take your time.

579
00:42:22.528 --> 00:42:24.337
Jae Hyun.

580
00:42:25.767 --> 00:42:26.937
Soo Jin.

581
00:42:41.848 --> 00:42:42.888
Soo Jin.

582
00:42:45.357 --> 00:42:46.658
Let's talk.

583
00:42:48.328 --> 00:42:51.198
Please hear me out.

584
00:42:54.568 --> 00:42:55.598
Please.

585
00:43:09.908 --> 00:43:11.548
How did you know I'm here?

586
00:43:11.977 --> 00:43:13.718
The cellphone which you dropped.

587
00:43:14.687 --> 00:43:16.187
I kept it all along.

588
00:43:18.087 --> 00:43:20.118
I read your billing history and came here.

589
00:43:25.098 --> 00:43:26.158
Soo Jin.

590
00:43:26.897 --> 00:43:28.897
I know you're very disappointed in me.

591
00:43:30.368 --> 00:43:32.098
You must've been so surprised and scared...

592
00:43:33.707 --> 00:43:35.937
when you found out what I did.

593
00:43:39.778 --> 00:43:41.008
I...

594
00:43:42.747 --> 00:43:43.848
can't forgive myself.

595
00:43:48.118 --> 00:43:50.988
When I was with Pil last night,

596
00:43:53.618 --> 00:43:54.658
did you...

597
00:43:55.627 --> 00:43:57.227
try to hit us with your car on purpose?

598
00:43:59.357 --> 00:44:01.127
When I saw you with Pil,

599
00:44:03.267 --> 00:44:04.468
I got mad.

600
00:44:06.198 --> 00:44:08.408
I did it without realizing what I was doing.

601
00:44:10.037 --> 00:44:11.607
Do you think that justifies it?

602
00:44:12.178 --> 00:44:13.207
So...

603
00:44:16.578 --> 00:44:18.477
Is that why you...

604
00:44:19.578 --> 00:44:20.718
randomly attack people?

605
00:44:21.587 --> 00:44:22.848
I don't know.

606
00:44:23.488 --> 00:44:24.587
I can't...

607
00:44:24.787 --> 00:44:26.818
control myself when I get mad.

608
00:44:27.727 --> 00:44:29.258
Even though I regret it,

609
00:44:30.258 --> 00:44:32.528
I can't control it. It drives me crazy.

610
00:44:36.298 --> 00:44:39.798
I still can't believe that you did such a thing.

611
00:44:42.908 --> 00:44:45.238
You were a nice person.

612
00:44:46.537 --> 00:44:48.278
But why did you do it?

613
00:44:51.118 --> 00:44:52.178
Never mind.

614
00:44:53.917 --> 00:44:55.787
Whatever excuse you give me,

615
00:44:56.548 --> 00:44:58.187
your deeds cannot...

616
00:44:58.658 --> 00:45:00.287
be overlooked.

617
00:45:04.428 --> 00:45:05.457
Jae Hyun.

618
00:45:08.568 --> 00:45:09.627
Turn yourself in.

619
00:45:11.497 --> 00:45:14.138
Pay for what you've done,

620
00:45:15.408 --> 00:45:16.738
and receive treatment.

621
00:45:19.138 --> 00:45:20.178
Then...

622
00:45:22.377 --> 00:45:24.147
you might get better.

623
00:45:30.287 --> 00:45:31.388
Okay.

624
00:45:32.787 --> 00:45:33.828
I'll turn myself in.

625
00:45:37.928 --> 00:45:39.298
Soo Jin,

626
00:45:41.198 --> 00:45:42.627
will you go with me?

627
00:45:53.238 --> 00:45:58.118
The person I loved

628
00:46:11.928 --> 00:46:13.057
Pil.

629
00:46:13.357 --> 00:46:14.828
Hi, Uncle. Where are you going?

630
00:46:14.828 --> 00:46:17.897
I'm going for grocery shopping.

631
00:46:18.298 --> 00:46:21.207
I saw Soo Jin with someone just now.

632
00:46:22.068 --> 00:46:23.508
- Someone? - Yes.

633
00:46:23.508 --> 00:46:25.908
He's about this tall.

634
00:46:26.037 --> 00:46:28.707
He looks manly and handsome.

635
00:46:29.607 --> 00:46:31.417
Who is he?

636
00:46:32.747 --> 00:46:35.448
Gosh, no.

637
00:46:35.448 --> 00:46:36.647
What?

638
00:47:31.008 --> 00:47:32.778
Park Jae Hyun is the culprit.

639
00:47:34.647 --> 00:47:36.247
Call the detective in charge.

640
00:47:36.508 --> 00:47:37.948
Tell him we've secured...

641
00:47:37.948 --> 00:47:39.517
the video footage of the assailant.

642
00:47:39.517 --> 00:47:40.818
Yes, sir.

643
00:47:44.258 --> 00:47:45.417
We should do something.

644
00:47:45.417 --> 00:47:47.857
Let's wait a little longer.

645
00:47:47.857 --> 00:47:49.388
Excuse me.

646
00:47:50.658 --> 00:47:52.758
We came in because the door was open.

647
00:47:52.857 --> 00:47:54.098
Excuse us.

648
00:47:54.328 --> 00:47:55.528
How may I help you?

649
00:47:55.528 --> 00:47:57.537
Is Ms. Kang Soo Jin here?

650
00:47:57.537 --> 00:47:58.897
She didn't answer her phone,

651
00:47:58.897 --> 00:48:00.228
and she wasn't at home,

652
00:48:00.253 --> 00:48:01.532
so we came here to see her.

653
00:48:02.508 --> 00:48:04.138
Why are you looking for my daughter?

654
00:48:04.377 --> 00:48:06.678
Did something happen to her?

655
00:48:07.508 --> 00:48:09.207
No, it's not that.

656
00:48:09.207 --> 00:48:11.778
Then why are you looking for her?

657
00:48:13.348 --> 00:48:14.787
Well...

658
00:48:15.448 --> 00:48:17.857
We want to ask her some things...

659
00:48:17.857 --> 00:48:19.917
regarding Mr. Park Jae Hyun.

660
00:48:19.917 --> 00:48:20.928
Park Jae Hyun?

661
00:48:21.828 --> 00:48:23.727
- Our son-in-law? - Yes,

662
00:48:24.028 --> 00:48:25.997
I'm sure you're aware of the random attacks...

663
00:48:25.997 --> 00:48:28.298
that have occurred in the neighborhood, right?

664
00:48:28.528 --> 00:48:29.698
- Yes. - Yes.

665
00:48:29.698 --> 00:48:32.497
What does it have to do with him though?

666
00:48:32.497 --> 00:48:34.037
Mr. Park...

667
00:48:34.468 --> 00:48:36.767
is the prime suspect of the case.

668
00:48:37.307 --> 00:48:39.238
- What? - What?

669
00:49:00.767 --> 00:49:01.798
Were you...

670
00:49:03.127 --> 00:49:05.098
with Pil last night?

671
00:49:05.468 --> 00:49:06.537
Yes.

672
00:49:08.937 --> 00:49:09.968
Did you...

673
00:49:10.707 --> 00:49:12.207
share a room with him?

674
00:49:14.948 --> 00:49:15.977
No.

675
00:49:16.678 --> 00:49:17.877
I can't do that.

676
00:49:17.977 --> 00:49:19.178
You're right.

677
00:49:19.448 --> 00:49:21.187
You would never do that.

678
00:49:35.198 --> 00:49:38.337
I thought we were going to Seoul.

679
00:49:39.537 --> 00:49:41.167
Why are you going this way?

680
00:49:42.807 --> 00:49:45.008
Let's drop by somewhere to get some fresh air.

681
00:49:47.977 --> 00:49:50.207
What are you talking about?

682
00:49:51.417 --> 00:49:53.247
You said you'd go turn yourself in.

683
00:49:54.218 --> 00:49:56.147
We couldn't even go on our trip to England.

684
00:49:56.147 --> 00:49:57.687
It'd be upsetting if we returned like this.

685
00:49:58.687 --> 00:50:00.357
We have enough time, so let's take it slow.

686
00:50:12.397 --> 00:50:13.468
Mr. Bong.

687
00:50:13.837 --> 00:50:14.868
Hello, Mr. Choi.

688
00:50:15.167 --> 00:50:17.278
Sorry, I'm a bit busy now.

689
00:50:17.278 --> 00:50:19.078
Are you with Soo Jin?

690
00:50:19.337 --> 00:50:20.377
What?

691
00:50:20.377 --> 00:50:22.548
If you are, come to Seoul with her quickly...

692
00:50:22.548 --> 00:50:23.977
so that she can testify.

693
00:50:25.917 --> 00:50:27.287
Like you said,

694
00:50:27.517 --> 00:50:29.118
Jae Hyun is the culprit.

695
00:50:29.318 --> 00:50:31.258
He turned his phone off...

696
00:50:31.258 --> 00:50:32.818
and is out of reach at the moment.

697
00:50:32.818 --> 00:50:33.928
I think he ran off.

698
00:50:33.928 --> 00:50:36.258
He's on the run in Gangneung...

699
00:50:36.258 --> 00:50:37.698
with Soo Jin now.

700
00:50:37.698 --> 00:50:39.658
- What? - I'm searching for them.

701
00:50:57.118 --> 00:50:59.917
Mr. Bong. What's going on?

702
00:51:13.457 --> 00:51:15.098
Why are you suddenly acting so weird?

703
00:51:51.537 --> 00:51:53.568
Hey, man. Learn how to drive.

704
00:52:06.618 --> 00:52:08.417
I think I lost Park Jae Hyun's vehicle.

705
00:52:09.048 --> 00:52:11.417
I'll search around the premise.

706
00:52:12.158 --> 00:52:13.158
Yes.

707
00:52:41.787 --> 00:52:42.948
You must be hungry.

708
00:52:43.118 --> 00:52:44.917
Give me a bit more time. I'll be done soon.

709
00:52:51.357 --> 00:52:52.357
Jae Hyun.

710
00:52:53.158 --> 00:52:54.698
Let's not do this,

711
00:52:54.897 --> 00:52:56.428
and go back to Seoul.

712
00:52:57.537 --> 00:53:00.068
You should go back and turn yourself in.

713
00:53:07.477 --> 00:53:09.408
It seems like you don't want to be here with me.

714
00:53:11.417 --> 00:53:12.448
What?

715
00:53:18.118 --> 00:53:20.017
It's been forever since we had a time like this.

716
00:53:20.428 --> 00:53:22.028
Let's forget about everything for now,

717
00:53:22.028 --> 00:53:23.187
and enjoy ourselves.

718
00:53:24.727 --> 00:53:25.798
Stay seated.

719
00:54:09.607 --> 00:54:10.977
(Your phone is loading.)

720
00:54:16.048 --> 00:54:17.048
(Pil)

721
00:54:23.318 --> 00:54:25.488
You must be hungry. Have this first.

722
00:54:25.587 --> 00:54:26.718
Sure, thanks.

723
00:54:31.127 --> 00:54:32.857
(Pil)

724
00:54:33.328 --> 00:54:34.397
Hello?

725
00:54:39.497 --> 00:54:40.638
Soo Jin.

726
00:54:40.968 --> 00:54:45.107
I finished cooking your favorite dish, steak.

727
00:55:04.158 --> 00:55:06.528
(Pil)

728
00:55:07.298 --> 00:55:09.098
Have some. I didn't have the right ingredients,

729
00:55:09.098 --> 00:55:10.468
so it might not be great.

730
00:55:10.468 --> 00:55:12.098
Sure, let's eat.

731
00:55:19.278 --> 00:55:21.278
How is it? Is it good?

732
00:55:21.278 --> 00:55:23.377
Yes, it's good.

733
00:55:24.647 --> 00:55:25.678
I had no idea...

734
00:55:26.618 --> 00:55:29.118
there was a place like this by the lake.

735
00:55:29.118 --> 00:55:30.457
Didn't I tell you?

736
00:55:31.118 --> 00:55:33.857
I think I said parents left me a summer house.

737
00:55:35.028 --> 00:55:36.388
I think you did.

738
00:55:37.698 --> 00:55:38.897
The lake we saw...

739
00:55:39.658 --> 00:55:42.028
on our way here was pretty splendid.

740
00:55:42.968 --> 00:55:44.298
What's it called?

741
00:55:47.267 --> 00:55:48.408
Haneul Lake.

742
00:55:50.037 --> 00:55:51.778
Oh, Haneul Lake.

743
00:55:53.747 --> 00:55:54.807
Isn't that a pretty name?

744
00:55:55.348 --> 00:55:57.318
It's prettier at dawn with the morning mist.

745
00:55:57.578 --> 00:55:58.718
It's really amazing.

746
00:55:59.848 --> 00:56:01.787
Okay, I'll make sure I catch that.

747
00:56:02.488 --> 00:56:03.587
Haneul Lake?

748
00:56:04.087 --> 00:56:05.457
Are you glad we came?

749
00:56:13.968 --> 00:56:14.968
Sure.

750
00:56:21.368 --> 00:56:23.468
(Pil)

751
00:57:16.957 --> 00:57:18.598
(49N4138)

752
00:57:24.568 --> 00:57:25.568
Thanks.

753
00:57:36.178 --> 00:57:37.848
- Soo Jin. - Yes?

754
00:57:38.848 --> 00:57:40.147
Should we leave Korea?

755
00:57:41.718 --> 00:57:42.917
What do you mean?

756
00:57:45.457 --> 00:57:47.627
If I turn myself in, I'll have to go to jail.

757
00:57:48.258 --> 00:57:50.287
Then you'll be too lonely by yourself.

758
00:57:55.198 --> 00:57:56.198
Why don't we...

759
00:57:56.667 --> 00:57:58.738
go live by ourselves in a remote place?

760
00:58:00.468 --> 00:58:01.807
Jae Hyun.

761
00:58:03.437 --> 00:58:05.678
All I need is you, Soo Jin.

762
00:58:07.107 --> 00:58:08.477
I don't need anyone else.

763
00:58:12.578 --> 00:58:14.718
Well, I...

764
00:58:20.787 --> 00:58:23.028
What is it? Is there something outside?

765
00:58:39.008 --> 00:58:40.747
(The last episode will be aired tomorrow.)
