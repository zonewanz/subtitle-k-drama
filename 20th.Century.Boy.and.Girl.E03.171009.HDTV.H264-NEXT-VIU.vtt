(The Four Bongos Forever)

3
00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:22.129
(Hello, Ah Reum and Young Shim.)

4
00:00:25.777 --> 00:00:27.277
"What do you want for dinner?"

5
00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.148
"Seafood noodles or tteokbokki?"

6
00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:39.288
"How long does it last?"

7
00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:43.358
It's asking how long we can continue doing this.

8
00:00:43.998 --> 00:00:45.398
What do you think "it" means here?

9
00:00:45.398 --> 00:00:46.458
- It means love. - It means love.

10
00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:48.928
How long do you think we can keep this love?

11
00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:51.197
How long will this love last?

12
00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.907
"Can love be measured by the hours in a day?"

13
00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:58.937
Can we measure the weight of love in hours?

14
00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:01.307
I'm not going to stay for self-study this evening.

15
00:01:01.648 --> 00:01:05.718
- I'm going to his Bangbae office. - Until the stars all burn away.

16
00:01:06.377 --> 00:01:08.147
Don't you want to experience this kind of love?

17
00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:09.187
- Yes. - Yes.

18
00:01:09.187 --> 00:01:12.017
Let's think about the lyrics while we sing the song again.

19
00:01:15.427 --> 00:01:18.028
I don't have anything to say. Why are we doing this?

20
00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:28.707
(Love Story)

21
00:01:31.308 --> 00:01:33.478
- A word, please. - Please look over here.

22
00:01:33.478 --> 00:01:35.177
- Please look over here. - How do you feel?

23
00:01:35.177 --> 00:01:37.448
Are you really the woman in the sex tape?

24
00:01:37.448 --> 00:01:40.888
- Are you the one in the video? - Are you the woman in the sex tape?

25
00:01:40.888 --> 00:01:44.187
- Please look over here. - Please look over here.

26
00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:46.517
- A word, please. - Please look over here.

27
00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:48.588
- A word please. - Please look over here.,

28
00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:50.358
- Please look over here. - How do you feel?

29
00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:53.058
- A word, please. - Please look over here.

30
00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:54.897
- Is it really you? - Did you do that?

31
00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:56.698
- Please look over here. - How do you feel?

32
00:01:56.698 --> 00:01:58.998
- A word, please. - Please look over here.

33
00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:01.638
- Please look over here. - How do you feel?

34
00:02:01.638 --> 00:02:05.278
- A word, please. - Please look over here.

35
00:02:05.278 --> 00:02:08.078
- A word, please. - Please look over here.

36
00:02:08.078 --> 00:02:10.047
- Tell us something. - Hey.

37
00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:11.617
Who was it in the video?

38
00:02:15.247 --> 00:02:18.457
- Is that your boyfriend? - Who is he?

39
00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:22.288
- What is he doing? - Is he the man in the video?

40
00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:24.497
- Who is he? - What's your relationship?

41
00:02:34.038 --> 00:02:35.267
Gong Ji Won.

42
00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:37.277
- Are you dating? - Please look over here.

43
00:02:37.578 --> 00:02:38.878
- A word, please. - Please look over here.

44
00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:40.948
- Please look over here. - How do you feel?

45
00:02:40.948 --> 00:02:43.578
- Please look over here. - Please look here.

46
00:02:43.578 --> 00:02:45.117
- Please look over here. - How do you feel?

47
00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:49.517
Jin Jin.

48
00:02:51.717 --> 00:02:54.158
Gosh. I'm here!

49
00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:56.587
President Jang! Hong Hee!

50
00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:58.897
- A word, please. - Please tell us something.

51
00:02:58.897 --> 00:03:00.598
- A word, please. - I'm here!

52
00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:02.568
Hurry up.

53
00:03:04.568 --> 00:03:05.698
Where's Jin Jin?

54
00:03:06.198 --> 00:03:08.108
Jin Jin! We're here.

55
00:03:10.038 --> 00:03:11.337
- A word, please. - Please tell us something.

00:03:23.017 --> 00:03:24.557
- A word, please. - Please tell us something.

59
00:03:25.217 --> 00:03:27.688
- Let's go! - A word, please.

60
00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:29.487
Let's go now!

61
00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:31.057
Please tell us something.

62
00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:33.258
Are you the man in the video?

63
00:03:43.638 --> 00:03:45.677
What's your relationship with Sa Jin Jin?

64
00:03:46.138 --> 00:03:48.608
- Please tell us. - Please talk.

65
00:03:49.147 --> 00:03:51.217
- A word, please - A word, please.

66
00:03:51.217 --> 00:03:53.848
- Look over here. - Please tell us something.

67
00:03:53.848 --> 00:03:55.388
- Please tell us. - Please talk.

68
00:03:55.388 --> 00:03:58.858
- Please tell us. - Hold on.

69
00:04:00.758 --> 00:04:02.128
Please tell us something!

70
00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:11.098
What video?

71
00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:17.337
Jin Jin, did you...

72
00:04:17.337 --> 00:04:19.977
- No. - It wasn't you, right?

73
00:04:22.207 --> 00:04:24.448
If you had... I mean...

74
00:04:24.717 --> 00:04:26.847
You need to tell me the truth so that I can take care of this.

75
00:04:26.847 --> 00:04:28.188
You crazy scum.

76
00:04:29.717 --> 00:04:31.017
You scum.

77
00:04:34.388 --> 00:04:36.628
(Resume)

78
00:04:56.277 --> 00:04:57.477
Why did you go to law school?

79
00:04:58.078 --> 00:05:00.147
Well, since I was young...

80
00:05:00.147 --> 00:05:01.948
People with good grades go to law school.

81
00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:06.488
What kind of lawyer do you want to be?

82
00:05:07.087 --> 00:05:10.357
I want to be a righteous lawyer who fights against the social evils.

83
00:05:10.897 --> 00:05:11.957
Is that all?

84
00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:15.727
- All right. - Wait.

85
00:05:16.068 --> 00:05:20.037
I remember what the director told us at the graduation ceremony.

86
00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:24.607
He told us that a lawyer is someone who listens to people.

87
00:05:25.477 --> 00:05:28.508
I don't have big dreams,

88
00:05:28.977 --> 00:05:31.277
but I want to be a lawyer...

89
00:05:32.078 --> 00:05:33.748
that listens to my clients.

90
00:05:35.948 --> 00:05:37.188
I'll give you an assignment.

91
00:05:43.227 --> 00:05:44.428
I'll come back after I have a smoke.

92
00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:46.128
All right.

93
00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:55.808
(Your desired salary)

94
00:05:58.938 --> 00:06:00.777
Ms. S, are you in Korea?

95
00:06:02.707 --> 00:06:05.417
Ms. S, answer me. Over.

96
00:06:09.217 --> 00:06:12.357
I just finished my interview. What happened?

97
00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:13.928
Ms. S, where are you?

98
00:06:15.428 --> 00:06:16.727
- Is it Jin Jin? - Gosh.

99
00:06:18.058 --> 00:06:20.227
Mind your own business.

100
00:06:20.428 --> 00:06:23.328
You should worry about me, your patient.

101
00:06:23.328 --> 00:06:25.498
You'll be fine. Ah Reum, look at this.

102
00:06:25.597 --> 00:06:27.068
Look.

103
00:06:27.068 --> 00:06:29.568
(Sa Jin Jin Arrives at the Airport and Leaves with a Mysterious Man.)

104
00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:32.277
Do you know this man?

105
00:06:33.548 --> 00:06:36.777
It was hard making sure the house gets fixed on the day you arrive.

106
00:06:36.777 --> 00:06:38.847
Gosh, you must have been through a lot.

107
00:06:38.847 --> 00:06:41.717
I did. There were so many things that had to be fixed.

108
00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:44.758
Well, the apartment is really old.

109
00:06:44.758 --> 00:06:45.957
I know.

110
00:06:46.357 --> 00:06:47.988
Why do you want to live there?

111
00:06:49.587 --> 00:06:51.058
Maybe because jajangmyeon tastes nice there?

112
00:06:51.058 --> 00:06:52.258
That's not even funny.

113
00:06:54.027 --> 00:06:55.727
Call your mother first.

114
00:06:56.837 --> 00:06:58.368
She's been waiting for your call.

115
00:07:08.347 --> 00:07:10.618
Look, she's coming over there.

116
00:07:28.868 --> 00:07:31.597
Don't worry. Don't use the internet.

117
00:07:31.597 --> 00:07:33.368
I'll take care of everything.

118
00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:36.037
By the way, you know there's a meeting, right?

119
00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:38.178
Try to read the scripts.

120
00:07:38.308 --> 00:07:40.277
- See you tomorrow, Hong Hee. - All right.

121
00:08:18.578 --> 00:08:19.948
Hello, Jin Jin.

122
00:08:20.017 --> 00:08:21.818
Hi, I'm home.

123
00:08:23.248 --> 00:08:25.717
Hi. You must be tired.

124
00:08:31.857 --> 00:08:34.768
Is it fun? Why are you watching that?

125
00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:37.367
What?

126
00:08:53.818 --> 00:08:54.847
Why?

127
00:08:55.217 --> 00:08:56.347
Have you eaten?

128
00:08:56.918 --> 00:08:59.257
- No. - You must be hungry.

129
00:08:59.257 --> 00:09:00.528
What shall I make you?

130
00:09:01.627 --> 00:09:05.227
- Bulgogi. - Is there anything else you want?

131
00:09:05.227 --> 00:09:06.558
Bulgogi is enough.

132
00:09:08.268 --> 00:09:09.597
Did you catch a cold?

133
00:09:09.597 --> 00:09:11.568
I'm okay. I just need some rest.

134
00:09:17.808 --> 00:09:19.207
It wasn't me, Mom.

135
00:09:19.207 --> 00:09:20.747
As you can see...

136
00:09:20.747 --> 00:09:22.308
It wasn't me.

137
00:09:22.648 --> 00:09:24.778
You have nothing to worry about.

138
00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:29.217
Okay.

139
00:09:47.237 --> 00:09:49.237
Ms. Sa Jin Jin, can we take a photo of you?

140
00:09:49.237 --> 00:09:50.278
Ms. Sa Jin Jin.

141
00:09:50.278 --> 00:09:52.308
- Look over here. - Is it really true?

142
00:09:52.308 --> 00:09:53.808
Can you tell us?

143
00:09:53.808 --> 00:09:55.607
- Is it really true? - Please say something.

144
00:09:55.607 --> 00:09:57.747
Was it you on the sex video?

145
00:09:57.747 --> 00:09:59.018
Are you the one in the video?

146
00:09:59.018 --> 00:10:00.318
Is it you...

147
00:10:00.318 --> 00:10:02.387
- in the sex video? - Ms. Sa Jin Jin.

148
00:10:02.387 --> 00:10:04.518
- Were you in the video? - Tell us the truth.

149
00:10:04.518 --> 00:10:07.688
- Please tell us. - Is the scandal true?

150
00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:15.597
Why isn't she picking up? I'm so worried.

151
00:10:15.597 --> 00:10:17.237
(Four Bongos)

152
00:10:18.798 --> 00:10:19.798
(New Message)

153
00:10:23.308 --> 00:10:24.538
(Four Bongos)

154
00:10:24.538 --> 00:10:26.578
My phone broke in Hong Kong.

155
00:10:26.578 --> 00:10:27.847
Were you worried?

156
00:10:27.847 --> 00:10:29.578
Don't get excited.

157
00:10:29.847 --> 00:10:32.518
Please calm down. We'll try again after five minutes.

158
00:10:32.518 --> 00:10:33.587
Okay.

159
00:10:35.387 --> 00:10:36.918
I didn't worry at all.

160
00:10:36.918 --> 00:10:39.658
I read an article that it'll be a severe punishment.

161
00:10:39.658 --> 00:10:41.558
Let's talk in person.

162
00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:44.528
When will you visit me? Hurry up. I'm bored to death.

163
00:11:19.957 --> 00:11:23.768
Gosh, there's not much to eat at home.

164
00:11:31.408 --> 00:11:34.707
Water is the most delicious.

165
00:11:34.707 --> 00:11:38.178
Goodness, that was a terrible meal.

166
00:11:40.247 --> 00:11:43.288
- This is delicious, Mom. - Help yourself.

167
00:11:43.288 --> 00:11:46.058
I'll be there after dinner. What about you, S?

168
00:11:46.058 --> 00:11:47.587
It'll be difficult tonight.

169
00:11:47.587 --> 00:11:49.788
Don't come. Stay home.

170
00:11:49.788 --> 00:11:52.457
No, you must come. Please?

171
00:11:52.457 --> 00:11:54.097
I'll be there after resting.

172
00:11:54.828 --> 00:11:57.938
- You must come. - Okay.

173
00:11:58.298 --> 00:12:01.768
- Who was that man? - Who?

174
00:12:02.768 --> 00:12:04.237
The man who saved you at the airport.

175
00:12:04.237 --> 00:12:06.607
Even his silhouette behind the blur stood out.

176
00:12:26.528 --> 00:12:27.828

00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:02.168

Tell me honestly

194
00:13:34.768 --> 00:13:38.038
I'm the only one for you

195
00:13:38.038 --> 00:13:40.068
- Yes - Only one for you

205
00:14:08.198 --> 00:14:09.367

215

They're so horrible.

216
00:16:25.367 --> 00:16:28.808
I was so upset that...

217
00:16:30.438 --> 00:16:32.607
It must have been hard.

218
00:16:35.148 --> 00:16:37.318
She still remained strong.

219
00:16:37.518 --> 00:16:39.818
She's Sa Jin Jin after all.

220
00:16:39.818 --> 00:16:43.587
She gained fame and experience despite all the difficulties.

290

It had always been there, but it was gone for some reason.

306

There's just a photo of the makeup.

307

- Mom. - Yes?

308
00:21:54.728 --> 00:21:56.167
So what?

309
00:21:57.137 --> 00:21:58.298
Tell me.

310

311
00:22:03.677 --> 00:22:05.877

312
00:22:06.337 --> 00:22:08.208
Should I complain to them?

00:23:22.988 --> 00:23:24.458
He's so strange.

332
00:23:24.687 --> 00:23:27.228
He should know whom he's asking.

333
00:23:29.528 --> 00:23:31.258
- Where are you going? - To Jin Jin.

334
00:23:31.498 --> 00:23:32.958
I'll bring it to her.

335
00:23:33.468 --> 00:23:34.627
Give it to me.

336
00:23:47.578 --> 00:23:48.647
Hi, Hong Hee.

337
00:23:48.847 --> 00:23:50.177
Hello.

338
00:23:51.478 --> 00:23:52.778
Have you eaten?

339
00:23:53.218 --> 00:23:56.518
Okay, so... Wait. Sit down.

340
00:23:59.988 --> 00:24:01.228
Just a moment.

341
00:24:05.498 --> 00:24:06.998
Jin Jin.

342
00:24:06.998 --> 00:24:08.768
Did you go to an OBGYN yesterday?

343
00:24:10.837 --> 00:24:11.937
Yes.

344
00:24:22.708 --> 00:24:23.778
(Sa Jin Jin, Missing for 7 Hours)

345
00:24:39.528 --> 00:24:40.968
What a mess.

346
00:24:42.328 --> 00:24:43.468
Hey.

347
00:24:43.768 --> 00:24:46.597
After what you did yesterday, you should've stayed at home.

348
00:24:46.837 --> 00:24:48.968
Why were you out in public?

349
00:24:49.607 --> 00:24:50.937
To an OBGYN?

350
00:24:50.937 --> 00:24:53.847
Ah Reum had surgery. Can't I visit a friend?

351
00:24:53.847 --> 00:24:55.778
Couldn't you have waited a few days?

352
00:24:55.778 --> 00:24:57.447
Or told me at least?

353
00:24:58.478 --> 00:25:00.788
What will you do about this?

354
00:25:00.788 --> 00:25:03.458
Just tell the media I visited a sick friend.

355
00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:05.718
It's easily said than done.

356
00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:11.157
Hello.

357
00:25:15.728 --> 00:25:18.897
I know you value the truth, but this is wrong.

358
00:25:18.897 --> 00:25:19.998
What's wrong?

359
00:25:20.508 --> 00:25:22.907
Was she at that hospital or not?

360
00:25:23.208 --> 00:25:25.637
She was there but to visit someone.

361
00:25:25.637 --> 00:25:27.708
We didn't write why she was there.

362
00:25:27.778 --> 00:25:29.748
We couldn't because we didn't know.

363
00:25:29.748 --> 00:25:32.218
You got an explanation out through another outlet.

364
00:25:32.218 --> 00:25:34.187
No one's believing us.

365
00:25:34.187 --> 00:25:36.988
What do you have against us that you'd do this?

366
00:25:37.018 --> 00:25:39.788
Sa Jin Jin went to an OBGYN.

367
00:25:40.187 --> 00:25:41.587
That's the only fact we have.

368
00:25:42.488 --> 00:25:45.328
Can you please take down that article?

369
00:25:45.558 --> 00:25:47.167
- Why? - "Why"?

370
00:25:49.468 --> 00:25:50.597
You scumbag!

371
00:25:53.708 --> 00:25:55.268
We're all in this swamp.

372
00:25:55.907 --> 00:25:58.278
How dare a tabloid write nonsense just to get a few more clicks?

373
00:25:58.407 --> 00:26:00.308
Don't ruin her life!

374
00:26:00.647 --> 00:26:02.078
You lowlife.

375
00:26:02.447 --> 00:26:06.048
Do whatever you want. I'll do whatever I want, okay?

376
00:26:07.788 --> 00:26:10.488
I'm tired. I have a cold.

377
00:26:11.657 --> 00:26:14.788
Get some sleep. You, get lost.

378
00:26:16.587 --> 00:26:19.258
You should've woken me up. I should go.

379
00:26:20.468 --> 00:26:22.697
Wear this. It's cold out.

380
00:26:24.998 --> 00:26:27.708
Sa Jin Jin got photographed leaving here last night.

381
00:26:27.867 --> 00:26:29.008
What?

382
00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:32.078
I bet she got an abortion. Have you heard the rumors?

383
00:26:32.778 --> 00:26:35.008
The nurses are really annoyed.

384
00:26:35.008 --> 00:26:39.447
They're busy already, and now, reporters are calling like crazy.

385
00:26:46.117 --> 00:26:48.627
She should admit to it now that there's proof.

386
00:26:48.927 --> 00:26:51.058
That video was a crucial hint.

387
00:26:51.328 --> 00:26:52.558
Unless she has a twin.

388
00:26:53.667 --> 00:26:56.867
"I drunk and drove, but it wasn't drink-driving."

389
00:26:57.238 --> 00:27:00.268
"I went to an OBGYN at night, but I'm not pregnant?"

390
00:27:00.667 --> 00:27:02.808
A celebrity's private life isn't news.

391
00:27:02.808 --> 00:27:04.238
Why is this a hot topic?

392
00:27:04.607 --> 00:27:07.048
I bet it's just for show.

393
00:27:07.548 --> 00:27:09.778
She makes way more than I do.

394
00:27:12.917 --> 00:27:15.687
She went into the hospital at 4am and left 7 hours later.

395
00:27:16.818 --> 00:27:17.887
Oh dear.

396
00:27:19.657 --> 00:27:21.788
What a total mess.

397
00:27:22.288 --> 00:27:26.258
The image she tried to create has gone down the drain.

398
00:27:27.798 --> 00:27:31.367
Reporter Kim, please write the truth.

399
00:27:32.068 --> 00:27:33.197
Okay.

400
00:27:33.837 --> 00:27:35.068
I love you.

401
00:27:39.677 --> 00:27:40.677
What's up?

402
00:27:41.508 --> 00:27:42.847
You should get going.

403
00:27:43.818 --> 00:27:45.748
It's Director Shin's first project in five years.

404

Jin Jin.

406
00:27:57.298 --> 00:27:59.157
Don't be too discouraged.

407
00:28:00.028 --> 00:28:01.068
Okay?

408
00:28:03.437 --> 00:28:05.068
Let's get going.

409
00:28:06.867 --> 00:28:08.038
Just a moment.

410
00:28:10.238 --> 00:28:11.407
Hi, Director Shin.

411
00:28:11.978 --> 00:28:13.447
We're just about to leave.

412
00:28:15.708 --> 00:28:16.708
What?

413
00:28:20.417 --> 00:28:21.488
Next time?

414
00:28:22.347 --> 00:28:23.758
Is this about the photo?

415
00:28:27.157 --> 00:28:28.788
Hey, have you not heard?

416
00:28:29.627 --> 00:28:31.228
- Heard what? - Jin Jin.

417
00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:35.328
- I know. - You do?

418
00:28:36.837 --> 00:28:38.837
Did I ask stupid questions last night?

419
00:28:38.837 --> 00:28:41.568
- Who cares? - I care.

420
00:28:41.867 --> 00:28:45.808
The biggest waste of time is worrying about celebrities.

421
00:28:45.808 --> 00:28:47.978
Whom should you worry about in your spare time?

422
00:28:48.078 --> 00:28:50.117
Me, Han Ah Reum, your patient.

423
00:28:50.117 --> 00:28:51.478
Will she be okay?

424
00:28:52.518 --> 00:28:54.488
What could you do if she isn't?

425
00:28:57.258 --> 00:28:59.087
I should apologize.

426
00:29:00.627 --> 00:29:04.197
Can you give me her phone number?

427
00:29:05.258 --> 00:29:08.468
It's for the best. We have too much on our minds.

428
00:29:08.828 --> 00:29:10.637
We can't go into a meeting like this.

429
00:29:11.568 --> 00:29:13.937
You need to rest. So do I.

430
00:29:13.937 --> 00:29:16.937
We rode a roller coaster over 100 times since yesterday.

431
00:29:23.107 --> 00:29:24.318
Hello, Mr. Kim.

432
00:29:26.218 --> 00:29:27.518
Breach of contract?

433
00:29:28.587 --> 00:29:31.357
It's not true, okay?

434
00:29:32.157 --> 00:29:34.387
SS Electronics and LGA Fashion too?

435
00:29:36.288 --> 00:29:38.157
It's really not true.

436
00:29:42.597 --> 00:29:44.137
- Let's go. - Jin Jin.

437
00:29:44.337 --> 00:29:46.738
The reporters surrounded your van.

438
00:29:47.137 --> 00:29:50.677
So I called you a limousine instead.

439
00:29:52.137 --> 00:29:53.907
Mi Dal, look straight ahead.

440
00:29:53.907 --> 00:29:56.478
Oh no. Save me.

441
00:29:56.478 --> 00:29:58.347
Mi Dal, get out of the way.

442
00:29:58.978 --> 00:30:01.847
Watch where you're going.

443
00:30:01.847 --> 00:30:03.657
Watch the road.

444
00:30:04.958 --> 00:30:06.927
Don't worry, Jin Jin.

445
00:30:06.927 --> 00:30:09.357
It's my second time on the road.

446
00:30:10.298 --> 00:30:13.768
What? Mi Dal, look.

447
00:30:14.367 --> 00:30:16.097
That was close.

448
00:30:16.097 --> 00:30:18.697
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

449
00:30:19.197 --> 00:30:20.607
(Jang Young Shim)

450
00:30:22.738 --> 00:30:25.008
- Young Shim. - Where are you?

451
00:30:25.008 --> 00:30:27.447
Reporters are camped outside your house. Come to my place.

452
00:30:27.447 --> 00:30:28.708
It's fine.

453
00:30:30.248 --> 00:30:32.218
It'll work out somehow.

454
00:30:33.278 --> 00:30:36.018
No. Okay, bye.

455
00:30:39.218 --> 00:30:41.627
Jin Jin, don't worry.

456
00:30:42.828 --> 00:30:44.657
What does your dad do?

457
00:30:46.058 --> 00:30:47.097
What?

458
00:30:47.097 --> 00:30:49.028
I think she's at home.

459
00:30:49.028 --> 00:30:50.028
Goodness.

460
00:30:50.028 --> 00:30:51.937
- What a mess. - It's a nuisance.

461
00:30:51.937 --> 00:30:53.607
Everyone knows already.

462
00:30:53.607 --> 00:30:56.107
- How long must we wait? - How much time is there?

463
00:30:56.107 --> 00:30:58.278
I really don't know anything.

464
00:30:58.278 --> 00:31:00.208
Bring me another battery.

465
00:31:01.308 --> 00:31:03.278
She wouldn't come out. Why would she?

466
00:31:03.278 --> 00:31:04.278
Is she in?

467
00:31:04.278 --> 00:31:06.377
I think she's in, but she won't come out.

468
00:31:06.548 --> 00:31:09.718
I hope all this waiting pays off.

469
00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:56.968
Hey, I heard that President Sung's really particular.

470
00:31:56.968 --> 00:31:59.968
My friend worked at his previous company.

471
00:31:59.968 --> 00:32:01.568
- Really? - Yes.

472
00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:06.177
He said that today's meeting didn't make any sense.

473
00:32:06.177 --> 00:32:08.847
Wasn't he friendly? First dinner, then drinks?

474
00:32:08.847 --> 00:32:11.917
I think he heard the rumors about you.

475
00:32:12.718 --> 00:32:15.617
The merger and acquisition expert from Hong Kong.

476
00:32:15.617 --> 00:32:18.788
That's you, Gong Ji Won.

477
00:32:19.687 --> 00:32:21.357
Stop laying on the pressure.

478
00:32:21.357 --> 00:32:23.528
I'm trying to lay it on as much as possible.

479
00:32:24.998 --> 00:32:26.197
Okay, thanks.

(National Chemicals Investment Report)

481
00:32:34.667 --> 00:32:37.238
Is it the 14th floor? Not the 15th?

482
00:32:39.208 --> 00:32:40.607
Let's try both.

483
00:32:43.478 --> 00:32:46.018
That chicken smells great.

484
00:32:46.647 --> 00:32:48.288
Where is it from?

485
00:32:49.447 --> 00:32:52.617
It's on the bag. Seoul Fried Chicken.

486
00:32:53.218 --> 00:32:54.328
What?

487
00:32:56.587 --> 00:32:57.758
I'll walk upstairs.

488
00:32:57.758 --> 00:32:58.758
Okay.
