1
00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:19.600
Don't move.

2
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.570
People all live according to their destiny.

3
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.250
Having a mother like me is your destiny.

4
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.310
Your daughter will live without 
her parents. That's also her destiny.

5
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.810
So don't blame me!

6
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.870
Mom. Mom!

7
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.830
Mom!

8
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.040
A woman who can kill her 
child can go to all lengths.

9
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.880
That is the reason I fear her.

10
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.590
Why did she suddenly appear 
after living so selfishly?

11
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.260
She came to visit me in my classroom.

12
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.060
She said she wants to work with me.

13
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.500
She just wants to use me...

14
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.200
to strengthen her position in her company.

15
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.700
What did you say to her?

16
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.400
Everything is over once you 
get involved with that woman.

17
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.340
I rejected her, but she 
won't give up easily.

18
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.010
- What will she do? 
- She will try to persuade me...

19
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.050
no matter what it takes.

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.750
Jung Hwa Young, 49 years old?

21
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.270
(Name: Jung Hwa Young)

22
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.090
Is she 10 years older than him?

23
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.560
She's completely a grandmother.

24
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.760
Who are these children?

25
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.510
They are her sons, 
Jung Tae Yang and Kim Woo Joo.

26
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.630
What?

27
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.540
They have different last names. 
Do they have different fathers?

28
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.740
Yes.

29
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.400
This is ridiculous.

30
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.090
Is Jung Do some kind of philanthropist?

31
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.280
She's not only old, but also 
had messy relationships with men.

32
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.130
What are the fathers like?

33
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.270
I found out about the father 
of the 2nd child, but not the 1st.

34
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.500
Why is that?

35
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.340
She must have given birth 
when she was 19 years old.

36
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.060
Strangely, there's no recorded
 information before her 20s.

37
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.640
What do you mean?

38
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.660
Well, I could not find any 
traces of her before her 20s.

39
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.400
What kind of secret does she have 
to have no traces of her whereabouts?

40
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.440
What does Jung Tae Yang do for living?

41
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.270
He's working at a resort in Guam.

42
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.740
I can't ask him in person then.

43
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.510
Find the father of the 
second child quickly.

44
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.120
He must have heard something 
if he had a child with her.

45
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.550
Yes, ma'am.

46
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.530
We don't know his father.

47
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.230
I sense something fishy here.

48
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.870
I will find something dirty in
 the end if I comb everything in detail.

49
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.570
I will be more thankful if 
the secret is fouler.

50
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.250
(Episode 5)

51
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.910
You must be anxious 
as you get nearer to Seoul.

52
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.480
- You keep sighing. 
- Don't mess with me.

53
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.180
You can be honest with me.

54
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.850
The menu development 
contest is just an excuse.

55
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.300
Your real intention is 
to chase after Ru Ri.

56
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.590
It was my mistake that day.

57
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.410
After you left, I was desperate 
of the thoughts of you.

58
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.740
I love you. Let's get married.

59
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.910
Lee Myung Rang.

60
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.580
I'm sorry. That was too much.

61
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.250
But Manager Jung,

62
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.400
you can't expect an easy, smooth path.

63
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.040
- It's going to be difficult. 
- What do you mean?

64
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.540
Persuading Ru Ri will be difficult.

65
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.060
But her father is even more difficult.

66
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.130
She has a curfew.

67
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.310
Her father will shave her head...

68
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.150
if she gets home after 9pm.

69
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.600
That's not the end.

70
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.710
During college, she couldn't 
drink or even participate in events.

71
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.210
How could she cause trouble 
in that circumstance?

72
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.360
I feel so bad for Myung Tae.

73
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.750
Even if they were in a relationship, 
they probably couldn't do anything.

74
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.820
I'm still envious of Ru Ri.

75
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.380
It means that he really loves her...

76
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.920
when he's concerned about her like that.

77
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.220
Why? What is your father like?

78
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.790
Mine?

79
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.300
My father is probably a rich man.

80
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.100
Really?

81
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.600
It's usually like that in dramas.

82
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.540
If you have a secret about your birth, 
you're a rich man's son.

83
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.110
Be good to me.

84
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.850
Then...

85
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.120
I've never seen the face of my real father.

86
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.560
Is he really the son of a rich man?

87
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.160
Samsong or Hyondai?

88
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.660
Or Xk?

89
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.170
Congratulations on getting discharged, Dad.

90
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.890
Congratulations on coming home unharmed.

91
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.840
This is my gift for your discharge.

92
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.110
What is this?

93
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.130
(Spa Ticket at Kings Hotel)

94
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.970
Father, you know that I prepared 
the gift, don't you?

95
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.720
Of course. Thank you.

96
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.220
Anyway,

97
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.430
today is a historical day.

98
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.950
Just as I returned from the jaws of death,

99
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.550
our family has been brought 
back to life again.

100
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.100
In other words, while I was 
having near-death experience,

101
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.060
I forgave your mom who was...

102
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.340
trying to break apart our family.

103
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.280
Mother, then did you give up 
on your marriage graduation?

104
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.570
This is great.

105
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.050
Mother, congratulations. 
Thank you, and good job.

106
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.010
You made the right decision, Mom.

107
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.810
I made concession for your guys' sake.

108
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.410
The best thing in this world 
is having a great family.

109
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.620
You're so right.

110
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.750
All right. Why don't we toast for that?

111
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.850
For us!

112
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.860
For men are powerful, 
for women are beautiful,

113
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.360
and today is a wonderful day!

114
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.860
To our family and our happiness!

115
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.410
- To us! - To us!

116
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.730
The photo arrived.

117
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.460
How is he?

118
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.170
He's 34 years old.

119
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.540
He went to an engineering school, and he's a promising...

120
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.840
assistant manager at the Korea Expressway Corporation.

121
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.420
Who is he?

122
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.410
What are you talking about? He's your future husband.

123
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.860
He's more than enough to be your husband.

124
00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.700
So go meet him on Saturday.

125
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.150
Dad.

126
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.600
Honey.

127
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.550
Hold on. Here we go.

128
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.290
I know I've committed a grave sin.

129
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.730
I'll do everything you tell me to do from now on.

130
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.500
Promises are meant to be kept.

131
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.180
I didn't know you were coming.

132
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.660
I want to try out the contest for menu developers.

133
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.430
You'll stay in Korea once you win the contest, right?

134
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.870
You should! I really missed you.

135
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.300
They're right. You're 30 now.

136
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.290
It's time for you to settle.

137
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.610
Hold on. I think you might have another reason for it.

138
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.790
Another reason?

139
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.680
You left no matter how hard we tried to keep you here.

140
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.980
Why did you come back all of a sudden?

141
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.450
I think the food contest is just an excuse.

142
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.490
Isn't there a real reason why you came back?

143
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.600
I got it! Tae Yang, you got a girlfriend, didn't you?

144
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.260
- What? - Goodness. That must be it.

145
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.610
Who is she? Is she pretty?

146
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.490
Bring her home. We'd like to meet her.

147
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.360
When is the contest?

148
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.870
As soon as it's over, I'll cook a big meal for you and her.

149
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.550
Goodness, calm down.

150
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.650
My family always gets ahead of themselves.

151
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.510
We're not that serious. She's just on my mind.

152
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.510
Then it's really about a girl?

153
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.090
- Awesome! - Awesome!

154
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.860
Let's shake hands.

155
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.920
You met ladies from all over the world.

156
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.970
You're into only one lady now.

157
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.300
Tae Yang, tell me. What is she like? How great is she?

158
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.670
She's not great. She's just different.

159
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.290
In what ways?

160
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.710
When I look at her,

161
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.900
she makes me smile.

162
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.120
- Goodness, look at you. - What's happening now?

163
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.990
I guess he really likes her.

164
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.730
Mom, I should go on the blind date, right?

165
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.080
You don't have to if you don't want to.

166
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.280
What happens if I don't?

167
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.200
I'll try to talk to your dad tomorrow.

168
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.420
To be honest, if you get married now after going on that blind date,

169
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.210
you'll end up in the same situation as mine.

170
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.190
Be financially independent.

171
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.850
Get married when you want to.

172
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.620
Or don't. It doesn't matter to me.

173
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.670
No, Mom.

174
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.270
Dad just recovered. I think I'm going to go on the date.

175
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.490
Besides, that guy won't like me. I know it for sure.

176
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.210
Men don't like me.

177
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.460
Someone once told me.

178
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.780
That I look ugly,

179
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.100
have a terrible body, and my career stinks.

180
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.570
Who told you such nonsense?

181
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.660
Ignore those guys who are foolish and can't recognize your worth.

182
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.470
Nothing is wrong with you.

183
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.890
You have your own charms.

184
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.350
You can just meet a guy who recognizes them.

185
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.300
Mom, you're the best.

186
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.770
- Mom. - Goodness.

187
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.170
I think you're the prettiest in the world.

188
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.860
Who are those fools?

189
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.020
They are, right?

190
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:06.130
It doesn't matter who you are and what your condition is.

191
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.370
Even if you have a problem sexually.

192
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.940
I'm ready to like you with all my heart.

193
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.580
No, I already like you.

194
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.360
Honestly, I've never thought about you like that.

195
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.360
Sometimes, your behavior and words don't match.

196
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.640
I was carried away by the atmosphere.

197
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.000
Hey, this is a marvel-of-Peru. What a beautiful scent.

198
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.970
This is beautiful. Oh, dear.

199
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.830
What's up with the color?

200
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.330
What is this juice?

201
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.530
Your daughter asked for this.

202
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.750
She did?

203
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.440
What on earth is this?

204
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.840
I get that this is healthy, but this is terrible.

205
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.340
It's salty like it's mixed with spit and snot.

206
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.550
Goodness, what on earth is this?

207
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.210
Good morning, Mommy.

208
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.450
Good morning.

209
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.520
- Hi. - I'm going to work.

210
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.000
I almost forgot. Here.

211
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.690
Honey, drink this before you go.

212
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.920
We're going to drink this every morning.

213
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.210
Drink up.

214
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.840
What is it?

215
00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.310
It's juice for our baby.

216
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.170
Green grapes, avocados, and perilla are in it.

217
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.490
My friend drank this juice and got pregnant with twins right away.

218
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.540
- Yeon Ju. - I told you.

219
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.440
I want a baby that takes after you.

220
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.440
Let's not waste our energy for nothing.

221
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.940
Let the nature take its own course. That's the best way.

222
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.600
Let's just live with whatever the universe gives us.

223
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.930
I'm going to work.

224
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.190
That punk. He and his temper.

225
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.160
He ought to cooperate if you want to have a baby.

226
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.830
He ought to do whatever it takes, as long as it helps you...

227
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.250
get pregnant.

228
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.970
It doesn't matter who drinks it, as long as it's effective.

229
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.950
From now on, stop talking.

230
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.220
Goodness.

231
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.230
What's wrong with you? You said you made the juice with all your heart.

232
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.490
No way.

233
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.510
Did you just have morning sickness?

234
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.050
Mom, does this mean I'm pregnant?

235
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.590
Oh, my! What are we going to do?

236
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.220
Goodness, you're pregnant.

237
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.590
My baby is having a baby.

238
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.390
- What do I do? - Hold on.

239
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.510
What should we do? Wait. Drink two cups. This is working.

240
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.460
Please get off the car, my lady.

241
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.730
Come on. Get off the car.

242
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.080
What's wrong with you? You're acting all awkward.

243
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.520
Come on. I told you.

244
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.150
To celebrate our reunion,

245
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.740
So Won told me to take care of you like a lady.

246
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.770
I only look like a lady,

247
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.470
but my heart has worn out.

248
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:37.810
That woman...

249
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.640
Yes? What is it?

250
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.270
Keep this in mind. Whatever you do,

251
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.910
make sure you win her heart over.

252
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.280
Hey, it's your day off. If you have time to call me,

253
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.880
spend some time with your wife.

254
00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.100
My wife and I are doing great. Just work on your relationship.

255
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.700
Just like you said, having a stable family matters the most.

256
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.640
Are you all ready?

257
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.680
After you change, please press the bell.

258
00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.990
Goodness, this is the best spa hotel in Gangnam.

259
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.960
This sure looks fantastic.

260
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:33.200
Hadn't it been for So Won, we wouldn't have had the chance.

261
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.000
Our son is the best.

262
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.640
Where are you going?

263
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.520
I'm going to change.

264
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.190
Come on. Don't act like this is the first time.

265
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.830
I've already seen your body. Just change here.

266
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:46.950
No.

267
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.070
I said it's okay.

268
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.800
Goodness. Just change your clothes here.

269
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.440
It's not like you have a great body or anything.

270
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.720
I don't want to.

271
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.630
How could you? Are we strangers?

272
00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.020
Okay, the lady should get changed here.

273
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.900
The servant will go inside.

274
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.760
It's being festered for a few years from stress.

275
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.090
Dad doesn't even know anything about it.

276
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.830
I wish you could be happy from now.

277
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.330
My lady.

278
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.610
Should I also take my underwear off?

279
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.890
Why would you take that off? That's indecent.

280
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.940
I thought we were going to the spa later.

281
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.700
My underwear will get wet from the spa.

282
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.070
Should I go home not wearing any underwear?

283
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.020
You can just wear the shorts in the spa.

284
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.360
Okay.

285
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.260
We're living in luxury today, thanks to our son.

286
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.460
I will do whatever you want me to do, my lady.

287
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.000
My lady.

288
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.370
Please change.

289
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.710
Gosh.

290
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.980
What's wrong?

291
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.940
Mom, what should I do?

292
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.850
Oh, my.

293
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.540
What's going on?

294
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.780
We counted our chickens before they hatched,

295
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.810
and we two made a big fuss about it.

296
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.680
That's embarrassing.

297
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.830
Don't cry.

298
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.270
What's the point of looking at it?

299
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.870
What is this?

300
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.200
Oh, my.

301
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.970
Are these two lines?

302
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.300
Are you pregnant?

303
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.700
- There's a baby in here right now. - There is.

304
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.940
- There is. - Mom, I need to call Father.

305
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.120
Wait a minute.

306
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.440
You need to be careful with important matters like this.

307
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.000
Let's do one more time to be certain.

308
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.650
Let's tell everyone when you have one that has two clear red lines.

309
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.620
So wait a minute. Stay still.

310
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.240
Is this a new one?

311
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.240
Urinate on this one.

312
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.190
Can you do it? Do it one more time.

313
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.700
I'll turn to my back.

314
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.830
That's right. It's not hard.

315
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.930
Go ahead. Thank you.

316
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.390
This is my reward for being kind in life.

317
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.490
7, 8, 9, 10.

318
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.130
Exhale and lower your feet.

319
00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.470
Namaste, you did a great job.

320
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.430
Namaste.

321
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.970
Thank you.

322
00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.980
(The Scent of Philosophy)

323
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.980
Young Hye, I love you.

324
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.970
You're embarrassing me. Why are you laughing?

325
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.230
You should be moved.

326
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.730
They say you'll die if you do things you haven't been doing.

327
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.630
You don't have to be like this. Just make me feel comfortable.

328
00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.730
Sit here.

329
00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:02.270
Why?

330
00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.070
Just sit here. Why do you talk so much?

331
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.410
Sit down.

332
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.480
What is wrong with you?

333
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.780
Hold on a second.

334
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.270
Oh, my.

335
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.080
What are you doing?

336
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.720
Stay still. I'm doing this because you're looking pretty today.

337
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.960
Let me go.

338
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.970
Stay still.

339
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.040
What are you doing when it's hot?

340
00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.150
Hey, do you hate me that much?

341
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.090
I can't believe this.

342
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.120
Honestly,

343
00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.800
I came back to my senses when you asked for a graduation.

344
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.770
Wait and see. I'm going to change completely.

345
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.990
I won't be troublesome like other retired men...

346
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.410
who ask for three meals a day.

347
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.540
I'll also give you an allowance to go on trips with your friends.

348
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.750
That's not what I want.

349
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.920
Then what do you want?

350
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.520
I want you to change your self-righteous personality.

351
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.460
Stop disregarding me for everything, and treat me like a human.

352
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.630
Understand and respect me.

353
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.180
I don't want to be your component. I want to be treated as a partner.

354
00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.420
That's all I need.

355
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.500
Okay, I will treat you equally...

356
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.040
as you want from now on.

357
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.640
No, I will treat you like a queen.

358
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.180
Is that enough?

359
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.320
I'm not kidding.

360
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.080
This really is the last time.

361
00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.470
What are you talking about?

362
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.320
I can't help it if you're offended.

363
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.530
If I continue living like this, I will probably die.

364
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.650
If you don't change,

365
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.330
I really won't stand it anymore.

366
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.620
Stop there.

367
00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.390
I understand, so stop nagging me.

368
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:20.470
Stop. It's an order. Stop.

369
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.420
(SC Food and Beverage is recruiting new menu developers.)

370
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.890
Today's the cooking competition. How are you feeling?

371
00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.830
Didn't you feel the house shaking?

372
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.330
Am I shaking?

373
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.030
Don't worry. It's obvious that you'll pass.

374
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.070
I dreamed a lucky dung dream for you.

375
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.690
You were so little,

376
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.110
and now you're teasing me just because you're big now?

377
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.510
Did anything happen at home?

378
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.880
Mom and Dad are shooting a melodrama throughout the year.

379
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.640
Something did happen. There was a scary witch.

380
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.140
- A witch? - Yes.

381
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.180
Dad's mother came to visit, and the atmosphere was frightening.

382
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.260
It feels dark like she will cause harm to us.

383
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:19.230
Since then, the two of them are whispering to each other every day.

384
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.570
I think they're worried, but they're not letting us know.

385
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.640
Really?

386
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.470
What kind of person is she?

387
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.440
Don't worry, leave it to me.

388
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.080
You should just focus on getting that funny girl.

389
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.400
Seoul is really nice. There are so many cute guys.

390
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.620
I would provide for the rest of their lives if they were mine.

391
00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.070
I'll earn a lot of money.

392
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.240
What are you mumbling about?

393
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.690
- I missed you. - Me too.

394
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.400
I'm happy to see you, but why are you dressed so old?

395
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.900
Did you get these from a bin? Why are there holes here?

396
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.020
Don't even talk about it. I'm embarrassed.

397
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.670
Why? Did something happen?

398
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.570
I'm going on a blind date set up by my dad.

399
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.860
Ru Ri.

400
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.800
What should you do?

401
00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.750
I'm really envious of you.

402
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.120
- You're envious? - Yes, I am.

403
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.150
Why would you be envious?

404
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.940
I really don't want to get married.

405
00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.140
Why, because of Manager Jung?

406
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.910
Are you crazy? I'm not interested in him.

407
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.760
They say strong denial is an affirmation.

408
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.980
It isn't.

409
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.930
I'm not going to see him again.

410
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.670
So don't even mention him ever.

411
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.820
Okay.

412
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.820
What's your blind date like?

413
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.990
Is he handsome?

414
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.690
He looks like this.

415
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.960
Oh, my.

416
00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.680
Doesn't he look unique?

417
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.590
Turn him over to me. I'll take him.

418
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.690
What? I thought you liked handsome men.

419
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.670
I'm not in a position to be picky.

420
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.190
You said you'd rather die than be on a blind date.

421
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.360
- I'll have him. - I can't do that.

422
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.930
He'll probably reject me, but I have to meet him because of my dad.

423
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.030
I'll do it for you.

424
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.440
Listen to me. It doesn't matter if he rejects you or me.

425
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.260
Your dad won't know at all.

426
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:24.220
You won't get hurt, and I'll get to go on a date...

427
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.660
with a guy after a long time.

428
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.330
I guess so.

429
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.620
Let me have him. I never asked you for anything like this.

430
00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.230
Toss him to me. Can't you do that for your friend?

431
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.430
Here. Just do a part-time job instead of me during that time.

432
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:44.430
This was really hard to get. It's really easy to do.

433
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.750
What kind of job is it?

434
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.410
You'll know when you get there.

435
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.550
Here.

436
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.870
- It smells so good. - Here are some side dishes.

437
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.190
All right.

438
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.710
For the woman whom I love the most in the world, Mrs. Jung.

439
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.710
Yes, but don't just say that.

440
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.780
Please stay in Seoul for good this time.

441
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.020
You shouldn't do that here.

442
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.220
Get off.

443
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.770
Why? What's wrong?

444
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.760
Do you think you can get away with that because you're pretty?

445
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.610
How can you let any men hug you like that?

446
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.160
It's starting again.

447
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.170
Tae Yang, I think I should go see a dermatologist.

448
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:23.500
I have goose bumps all over my body.

449
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.500
Gosh.

450
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.770
That's nothing.

451
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.490
I don't eat chicken anymore because I don't want to see goose bumps.

452
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.110
Really?

453
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.640
Today's menu was samgyetang, but there's nothing for you.

454
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.060
Give it back.

455
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.470
By the way, Mom, I heard Eun Byul's grandmother was here.

456
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:39.980
What is she like?

457
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.690
Well, she is...

458
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.690
You don't need to worry.

459
00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.260
She has nothing to do with me.

460
00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.960
You never have to meet her or get involved with her...

461
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.880
ever again.

462
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.400
You need to be ready for the food contest today.

463
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.480
Let's eat first. You can do this, Tae Yang.

464
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.200
Go, Tae Yang!

465
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.170
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

466
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.170
- 1, 2, 3. - Let's do this!

467
00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.840
There's no chicken soup for you.

468
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.870
- No. - Let's eat.

469
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.990
All right.

470
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.460
I'm going to get two servings.

471
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.700
(Menu developer candidates)

472
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.010
These are the candidates who got into the second round?

473
00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.070
Yes, these six candidates' menu portfolios have been accepted.

474
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:16.990
Is there anyone good enough?

475
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.990
There is one likely candidate called No Ji Shim.

476
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.140
He has won in every cooking competition.

477
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.650
If Chairman Kevin takes a liking to a person like that,

478
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.380
Jung Do will no longer have a place to work here.

479
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:33.250
By the way, what happened to the thing I asked you to do?

480
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.290
I told you to find out about Jung Hwa Young's second husband.

481
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:37.990
Here you go.

482
00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.570
(Name: Kim Jin Woo)

483
00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.190
Kim Jin Woo, 51 years old.

484
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.540
Former police officer.

485
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.820
He married Jung Hwa Young in 1995,

486
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.240
gave birth to their son Kim Woo Joo, and got divorced five years later.

487
00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.430
Is this it?

488
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.430
He was addicted to gambling, so he got divorced,

489
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.370
and he lost his job.

490
00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.890
So? Where is he now?

491
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.150
Well,

492
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.440
he doesn't have a permanent place where he is staying.

493
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.870
It's impossible to find him.

494
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:14.760
Bring him to me, even if that means you have to search the whole nation.

495
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.400
That's the only way I can separate Jung Do from that woman.

496
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:21.770
Do you understand?

497
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.240
Like this, slowly.

498
00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:31.210
Like this, slowly.

499
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.490
Hi, it's been a long time.

500
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.510
You've become like a Miss Korea since we got divorced.

501
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.630
You look so much better.

502
00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.920
Why did you come here again?

503
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.570
You said you won't see me again.

504
00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:00.140
It's been five years since you saw your ex-husband.

505
00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.140
Aren't you being a little cold?

506
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.640
Get out right now. I have nothing to talk to you about.

507
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.020
All right. I came here because of you.

508
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:13.820
Does it upset you so much that I am here?

509
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.320
I'm going.

510
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:16.820
By the way,

511
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.740
someone is doing a background check on you.

512
00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.200
Why is that?

513
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:25.130
What do you mean?

514
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:27.480
Who's doing a background check on me?

515
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.570
Someone was trying to find out information on me.

516
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.990
So I dug up a little.

517
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.690
I have a lot of police friends, you know.

518
00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.630
So? What does that have to do with me?

519
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.810
They weren't interested about me.

520
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.080
It was about you.

521
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.480
So be careful.

522
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.340
So what did you tell them?

523
00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.660
What did you tell them, Jin Woo?

524
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.010
Tell me what you said.

525
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.430
I'm thinking about what I should tell them.

526
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.450
Should I tell them everything about you?

527
00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.250
Or should I tell them what you want me to tell them?

528
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.260
No, you can't say anything.

529
00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.740
You shouldn't even meet them.

530
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.130
You can't. Don't meet them!

531
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.320
Of course. You're my son's mother.

532
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.720
I won't say anything bad about you.

533
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.390
But it seems like there are a lot of members learning here.

534
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:29.000
You must be earning a lot from here.

535
00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:31.900
How much?

536
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.500
How much do you need? How much do you want?

537
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.510
You didn't need to.

538
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.080
I'll give you my account number. Transfer the money.

539
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.310
I'm going.

540
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.680
I beg you. My son's life depends on you.

541
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.820
So please be careful.

542
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.520
You need to be clear on that one.

543
00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.260
You son is going to be in trouble.

544
00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.330
Jung Tae Yang.

545
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.930
You had a lot of secret from the past.

546
00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.470
If your son...

547
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.410
finds out about your secret,

548
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.480
what would happen?

549
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.180
(SC Food and Beverage)

550
00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.730
SC Food and Beverage?

551
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.970
What kind of job is this?

552
00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.740
(2017 SC Food and Beverage Menu Developing Contest)

553
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.980
Why isn't Myung Rang coming?

554
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.440
It's been a while.

555
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.000
What are you doing here?

556
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.240
I came here to work instead of Myung Rang.

557
00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:55.680
What?

558
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.080
What should I do with her?

559
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.920
What is it?

560
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:09.590
Follow me.

561
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.210
Where are you going?

562
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.510
To the menu developing contest.

563
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:15.260
You're going to be my assistant today.

564
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.460
What?

565
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.350
This must be one of her jokes.

566
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.130
She made you do her job.

567
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.540
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

568
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.410
Why not?

569
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.080
Have you forgotten...

570
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.750
what you said to me?

571
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.190
I don't want to be involved with you,

572
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.220
whether it's personal or job related.

573
00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:44.220
Goodbye.

574
00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.530
I want to be involved with you.

575
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.430
Personally.

576
00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.440
I'm sorry I hurt you that day.

577
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.540
I want to tell you something.

578
00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:06.080
Please forgive me, and let's enter the contest first.

579
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.430
After this, we can grab something to eat and talk over this.

580
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:10.580
I don't have...

581
00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.020
anything to talk about with you.

582
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.660
And it's too late for that.

583
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.760
I made a promise to my father to never meet you again.

584
00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.000
And I will keep that promise.

585

Lee Ru Ri.

586
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.170
Lee Ru Ri!

587
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:35.860
I'm sorry.

588
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.240
It's all right. You can go.

589
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.350
Gosh, he's so clumsy.

590
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.830
He looks familiar.

591
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.500
Where did I see him?

592
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.430
Isn't that Jung Hwa Young's son?

593
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.700
Why is he here?

594
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.940
Jung Tae Yang.

595
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.280
- He made it to the second round. - What?

596
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.810
How dare he come here?

597
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.480
Make sure you stop him from entering the contest.

598
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.370
Ma'am.

599
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.120
Don't say anything. Do whatever it takes to stop him.

600
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.760
Hey, Lee Myung Rang. How could you...

601
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.160
How was your reunion with him?

602
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.410
Did you hug him too?

603
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.400
- Hey, Myung Rang. - Be nice to him.

604
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.340
Manager Jung stayed up all night for it. You must win.

605
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.840
Please stop trying to connect me with him.

606
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.230
You'll be fat if you say things you don't mean.

607
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.800
You can thank me later. Bye now, dear.

608
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.230
I'm on a date...

609
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.240
with a guy after a long while.

610
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:53.910
Are you seriously my friend?

611
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:59.220
She's only making me more confused when I'm trying to forget him.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.200
Manager Jung. I really don't have any feelings left...

616
00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.720
I'm hurt.

617
00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.120
Help me, please.

618
00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.520
Hurry up.

619
00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.290
What?

620
00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:43.660
Where are you?

621
00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.700
Manager Jung.

622
00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.640
Are you okay?

623
00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.810
You're bleeding.

624
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:58.810
You're here.

625
00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:01.250
How can you smile?

626
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.050
What on earth happened?

627
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.220
Someone pushed me from the back,

628
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.670
but I'm not sure.

629
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:10.790
What?

630
00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:13.660
Who?

631
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.500
That's not what's important now. The competition is starting soon.

632
00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:19.730
In this condition?

633
00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:22.000
No, you can't. You're hurt.

634
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.700
You even hurt your hand.

635
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.110
Cook as I tell you today.

636
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.410
- I need you. - What?

637
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.080
Pick up the ingredients.

638
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.450
No. I don't know how to cook.

639
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.170
Mom never let me cook saying...

640
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:42.120
that I'll get to cook endlessly when I get married.

641
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.120
I really can't.

642
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.460
We need to go to the hospital. I'll go ask for help.

643
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.930

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.640
No. I really can't do it. There's no way.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.890
Is Mr. Jung Tae Yang not here?

658
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:35.140
Then he'll be considered withdrawn, and we'll begin the contest now.

659
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:39.310
Begin cooking for 80 minutes upon the sound of a buzzer.

660
00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:40.580
Wait a moment.

661
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.180
Jung Tae Yang is here.

662
00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:48.790
There was an accident, but I can cook.

663
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.060
- Did you bring yellow radishes? - Yes.

664
00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.490
In the South pole, there are six types of penguins...

665
00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.640
including emperor penguins.

666
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.310
Hello?

667
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:51.200
I'm in the hospital. Where else would I be?

668
00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.750
I just got out of a surgery.

669
00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:55.540
Come home fast.

670
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.970
My baby has a big problem.

671
00:39:57.970 --> 00:39:59.490
A big problem.

672
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.180
What do you mean?

673
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.280
You can check it yourself when you get here.

674
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.200
Hurry up. Come on. Come on. Hurry up.

675
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.040
She never leaves me alone.

676
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.540
Gosh, she's tiring.

677
00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:26.970
Here. Have a drink.

678
00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:28.590
You'll feel rested.

679
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.790
Are you okay to drink?

680
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.660
Don't worry about it.

681
00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.800
I'm fine now.

682
00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:41.430
Money is good.

683
00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.510
My skin feels so firm.

684
00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.370
Even a fly will slip.

685
00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.480
Feel my cheek here.

686
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.880
- It's okay. - Come on.

687
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:56.630
Try touching me.

688
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.090
It's smooth enough to slip.

689
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:07.460
Honey, did you mean what you said earlier?

690
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.930
Are you really going to understand and respect me?

691
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:18.000
I said don't worry about it.

692
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.090
How many times do I need to say it?

693
00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.010
Can't you tell from what I did today?

694
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:25.980
Then let me ask you a favor.

695
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.530
Yes. Go ahead. What is it?

696
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.520
Tell me. I'll do anything for you.

697
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.590
Don't be so mean to Ru Ri.

698
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.790
She doesn't want to go on a blind date.

699
00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:47.600
I'm fine with anything, but stay out of problems with Ru Ri.

700
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.720
You don't have a right to talk. Just enjoy the spa.

701
00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.640
- Honey. - What are you doing?

702
00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.740
No words can justify your action.

703
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:04.980
Who dragged her out from living in the bottomless mud?

704
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.700
If it wasn't for me, she'd be still...

705
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:12.660
living with that man in Guam.

706
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.530
He's a piece of garbage with no responsibility.

707
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:20.880
What if she had gotten pregnant?

708
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.050
That could have ruined Ru Ri's life.

709
00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:24.600
That's not true.

710
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.610
Ru Ri told me their relationship is nothing like that.

711
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.660
He's just a manager.

712
00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:32.760
- She was only borrowing a room. - How can you trust her?

713
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.400
She lied to me until now that she was working at...

714
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.920
the Visitors Bureau.

715
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.570
She was honest with me.

716
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.890
You will never know if she's being honest with you.

717
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:50.680
People who get in trouble aren't smart like So Won,

718
00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.520
but dumb and stupid like Ru Ri.

719
00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.000
My gosh. Watch your mouth, please.

720
00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.510
You always say she's stupid.

721
00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.530
That's why she's always discouraged and not confident.

722
00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:07.680
Why's that my fault?

723
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:10.580
Honestly, she's stupid because she takes after you.

724
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.620
Ru Ri is 29 now.

725
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.240
No one knows what her future will be like,

726
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.940
so please give her time.

727
00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.160
Stop it.

728
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:22.830
How dare you talk back to me?

729
00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:26.500
Marriage is the best for someone so helpless like Ru Ri.

730
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.850
She falls behind in every sense except that she's young.

731
00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.620
We must get rid of her before she turns 30.

732
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.310
It's pissing me off.

733
00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.380
Oh, dear.

734
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.050
Honey.

735
00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.920
Stop it now.

736
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:51.790
I worry about my daughter as much as you do.

737
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:56.450
I'll find the right man and make her marriage succeed like So Won's.

738
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:58.000
So Won's marriage?

739
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:01.400
Do you think that's so great?

740
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.550
He might be regretting his marriage.

741
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:07.640
What do you know?

742
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:11.580
There are so many doctors nowadays.

743
00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.760
Owning three keys is nothing now.

744
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.030
So Won was able to open his own clinic in Gangnam,

745
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.920
thanks to his in-law.

746
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:19.370
And that's not all.

747
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:22.520
His wife is so obedient, and his mother-in-law is rich.

748
00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.490
There's nothing to complain about.

749
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.390
Then why would he get himself a second house?

750
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.900
What?

751
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:32.100
What do you mean?

752
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.700
He said his house suffocates him,

753
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.220
so he got himself a studio without Yeon Ju knowing.

754
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.040
And he takes breaks there.

755
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.640
So Won's staying quiet,

756
00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:50.680
but it must be difficult to live with his in-law.

757
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.570
He never smiles, and he looks worried.

758
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:55.790
Don't think too much.

759
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.390
A man can get a second house if he's competent.

760
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:05.160
When I was his age, I wanted to get away from my family too.

761
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.720
If he's on good terms with his wife, it won't be a problem.

762
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.000
If that's the case, why don't they have any children?

763
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.120
So Won is not happy.

764
00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.390
Because of you, he's living unhappily...

765
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:20.180
with someone he doesn't like because she has good background.

766
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.580
We should have matched him with with Su Mi.

767
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.190
What?

768
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.140
Shut your mouth! How dare you...

769
00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.220
talk to me about that?

770
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:32.990
Honey.

771
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:37.730
She was a wicked girl who was going to ruin my son's life.

772
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.780
Don't ever talk to me about her.

773
00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:43.100
I don't even want to think about her.

774
00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.340
Honey.

775
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.640
Did you do it?

776
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.180
Did you meet her while So Won was in the military?

777
00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.360
If that wasn't the case, why would she leave him so suddenly...

778
00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.750
despite having been deeply in love with him?

779
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:01.800
Did you break them apart?

780
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.960
Is that true? Is that it?

781
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.060
Shut it.

782
00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.990
Shut it. Shut your mouth!

783
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:15.200
I'm warning you.

784
00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:18.870
Don't talk to me about her again.

785
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.210
I won't let it slide by.

786
00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:44.330
He has a good life now. What's the problem?

787
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.490
I'm home.

788
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.690
Doctor Lee,

789
00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.530
I called you a long time ago. What were you doing...

790
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.480
that took you so long?

791
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.320
I'm sorry. I was just finishing up a surgery.

792
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:08.470
But what happened to Yeon Ju?

793
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:12.810
Congratulations, congratulations

794
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:16.930
Let's celebrate our love

795
00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:20.520
You're all right. You startled me.

796
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.650
Gosh, this is a surprise for you.

797
00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:25.820
Hurry up and turn the light out.

798
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.010
Something great is going to happen.

799
00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.650
What is it?

800
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:35.250
Here.

801
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.660
You're...

802
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.750
In 10 months, you'll be a father,

803
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:52.600
and I'll be a mother.

804
00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.820
You were so negative, but I see...

805
00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.770
that you've been doing everything behind my back.

806
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:04.640
Do you like it? Are you excited? Are you happy?

807
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:07.480
Of course. Well done.

808
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:45.120
Do you want to watch...

809
00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.720
a movie with me?

810
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:55.060
Let's have a dinner after that.

811
00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:01.170
So Won said he booked one of the most popular restaurants for us.

812
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.700
You like nice dinners.

813
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:06.270
I heard it's nice.

814
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.430
Gosh, you're so mean.

815
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:13.600
You tease me, and then when I get angry,

816
00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.910
you pretend to be the victim and act all sad.

817
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.220
People would think that I'm the bad guy here.

818
00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.570
If you don't make me angry,

819
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.670
I'm as gentle as a sheep.

820
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.610
Why do you have to talk about the past that is unnecessary...

821
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:30.160
and make me look like a crazy person?

822
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.840
All right.

823
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:41.370
I will answer your question right now.

824
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:45.810
The person that made So Won break up...

825
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:48.850
with his ex-girlfriend wasn't me. I swear.

826
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:53.420
So don't suspect me of something like that.

827
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:59.790
Really?

828
00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.180
It really wasn't you?

829
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.100
Yes, I swear.

830
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:08.430
That's a relief.

831
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.500
If you were the one who did that...

832
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:14.220
and matched him with a girl as if you were selling him,

833
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.990
I will never be able to forgive you.

834
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:18.910
I told you it wasn't me. It wasn't.

835
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:30.690
Yes?

836
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:34.660
What?

837
00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.160
Is that true?

838
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.200
All right. Congratulations.

839
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:50.410
You don't need to worry about So Won anymore.

840
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:53.810
It has just proven that he's okay.

841
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.320
His wife has a baby.

842
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:02.790
Really?

843
00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:08.060
Now, leave Ru Ri's marriage to me.

844
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.900
Before she does anything strange, I will match her with someone.

845
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.620
Are you tired?

846
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.620
You're doing well.

847
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.940
10 minutes left.

848
00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:41.160
You need to finish up.

849
00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:56.260
What should we do?

850
00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.310
Everyone is finishing up, and yet this is all we have.

851
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:01.030
Don't worry.

852
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:03.300
We just need to pour the sauce, and we're done with the steak.

853
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.370
- Really? - Here's the sauce.

854
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:05.370
Okay.

855
00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:06.920
Take the meat out and...

856
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:11.390
No!

857
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:21.700
What are you doing?

858
00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:28.610
If you're going to cause problems, you should leave now.

859
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.480
I'm sorry, but I want to continue.

860
00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.560
There's eight minutes left. Would he be able to finish by then?

861
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.550
I'm so sorry, Manager Jung.

862
00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.850
Let's go inside.

863
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.250
I'm sorry, Manager Jung.

864
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:49.840
You ruined everything because of me.

865
00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.620
I can't do it anymore.

866
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.160
You're doing well. Let's go inside.

867
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.660
I don't want to.

868
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:00.780
You've been preparing a lot for this,

869
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.870
but I ruined everything.

870
00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:05.820
I should have told you that I couldn't do it from the start.

871
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.040
Listen to me.

872
00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:10.210
You can do it. Do you know why?

873
00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.030
Having impeccable taste is the most important thing in cooking.

874
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:18.150
I've never seen anyone eat something as well as you do.

875
00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:22.240
When you were in Guam, you recognized all the ingredients.

876
00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.960
That's just because I like eating, and I also eat a lot.

877
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:34.300
(Chinese pepper)

878
00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.370
Smell it.

879
00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:50.950
I don't know well, but it smells like Chinese pepper.

880
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:54.420
It's pepper used to season malatang.

881
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:58.210
My mom uses it to season sujebi because it tastes refreshing.

882
00:54:58.210 --> 00:54:59.760
She always uses it for sujebi.

883
00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.730
Am I still wrong?

884
00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:05.830
This is...

885
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:07.600
Let's not give up.

886
00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.270
We still have six minutes left.

887
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:16.810
Let's go.

888
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:31.090
I'll give you a riddle.

889
00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:37.560
What do you call the person who just got out of a restroom?

890
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.800
How should I know that?

891
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.550
Japanese.

892
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:45.640
What?

893
00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:47.460
Who went to the restroom.

894
00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.540
The person who went to the restroom. Japanese.

895
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.010
It's hilarious.

896
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.480
I see.

897
00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.200
Shall we get going now?

898
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.640
Shall we meet again on Friday?

899
00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.670
I'm sorry. I'll be working late.

900
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:05.070
- Then Saturday? - I'm going on a business trip.

901
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:06.890
- Then next week? - I'm...

902
00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.300
going to the army.

903
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:15.230
If you want this back, meet me here on Friday.

904
00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.050
Hey, Lee Ru Ri.

905
00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:19.640
Hey, I'll kill you if I catch you.

906
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:22.910
What's wrong with her?

907
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:29.410
Why doesn't she just leave?

908
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:38.790
She's scary.

909
00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:47.300
Pour it now.

910
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:54.040
Time's up.

911
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:57.010
Stop right there.

912
00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.700
We'll now judge it.

913
00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:04.350
(No Ji Shim)

914
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:17.660
I've mixed Korean food with Western food.

915
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:20.150
It's pork neck steak with kimchi pilaf.

916
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:22.150
You know you get no point for the presentation, right?

917
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:23.840
Yes. I'm sorry.

918
00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.270
I didn't have time for decoration because I redid it.

919
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:28.840
Please taste it first.

920
00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.780
Doesn't food taste good when it looks good?

921
00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:46.660
Sometimes there's an exception.

922
00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:57.100
(Hwa Young Dance Studio)

923
00:57:58.450 --> 00:58:02.040
You had a lot of secret from the past.

924
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:05.980
If your son finds out about your secret,

925
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:07.750
what would happen?

926
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.840
What are you doing here? Why didn't you pick up your phone?

927
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.290
I'm sorry. I had to clean up.

928
00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:24.660
Did you cry?

929
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.100
No. Dust went in my eyes.

930
00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:32.470
Are you hiding something?

931
00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:38.910
You said...

932
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:43.080
Mother will do anything to bring you back.

933
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.450
Does that include me?

934
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.750
What do you mean?

935
00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.520
Someone's going after me.

936
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:53.730
I can't think of anyone but Mother.

937
00:58:56.850 --> 00:58:58.430
That's possible.

938
00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:01.050
But why is that a problem?

939
00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:02.970
There's nothing about you.

940
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.040
I know...

941
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:13.650
there's something you're hiding from me,

942
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:19.450
but I can tell how much you suffered...

943
00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:23.460
from the fact that Tae Yang and Woo Joo have different fathers.

944
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:26.290
Don't worry about it.

945
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:31.080
I don't care what kind of person you were...

946
00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.930
or what you did in the past.

947
00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.470
I'm happy with who you are now.

948
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:55.420
Why can't you handle it properly?

949
00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:59.660
Because of you, Jung Tae Yang is about to enter my company.

950
01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:01.260
I'm sorry.

951
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:04.430
But there's still the third interview with the chairman.

952
01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.500
You'll be fired if you do anything that you'll be sorry for.

953
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:12.000
Bring Jung Hwa Young's second husband as soon as possible.

954
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.270
Yes, ma'am.

955
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.850
Here's your medicine, Manager Jung.

956
01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.190
Okay.

957
01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.830
Take it three times a day after the meal. Don't forget to take it.

958
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.100
Thank you.

959
01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:47.840
- It's a lucky day today. - Pardon?

960
01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.360
No bone is broken.

961
01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.360
Even though I'm the last, but I passed the second round.

962
01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.080
And I also found a useful assistant.

963
01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.450
I'll leave now since you're okay.

964
01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:06.490
What's wrong?

965
01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:09.560
The third round is next week.

966
01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:12.430
I won't get any better by then. We need to work together.

967
01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.230
I can't.

968
01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:18.100
I don't have a right nor the confidence.

969
01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:20.490
Find another assistant.

970
01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:23.540
I make the decision. You have a right and the confidence.

971
01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.080
So you must join me for the third round.

972
01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:27.980
I don't want to.

973
01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:31.530
Why not? Do you want a raise?

974
01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:33.220
That's not it.

975
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:38.620
Don't make me confused.

976
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.260
You are the one confusing me.

977
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.200
Can't you tell why I joined the menu development contest?

978
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.200
Can't you tell?

979
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.470
Are you saying it's for me?

980
01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.410
You said you're not interested in Guam.

981
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:07.920
I was wrong.

982
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:10.860
That's why I came back.

983
01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:14.580
Manager Jung. I...

984
01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.830
Hey, aren't you hungry?

985
01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.600
You can answer me after the meal.

986
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:21.700
