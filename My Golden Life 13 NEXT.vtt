(Episode 13)

4
00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:21.914
So you are...

5
00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.885
the real Ji Soo.

6
00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:28.984
My...

7
00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:31.824
dead sister?

8
00:00:34.364 --> 00:00:35.625
Ji An,

9
00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:37.334
you should not go to their house.

10
00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:49.358
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

11
00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:06.594
Mom.

12
00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:12.335
Mom.

13
00:01:14.835 --> 00:01:16.335
Mom, how...

14
00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:19.775
How could you?

15
00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:22.544
Mom, how...

16
00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:27.385
Mom.

17
00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:30.814
Mom, how could you do that?

18
00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:34.184
How? What should I do?

19
00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:40.294
Mom must have gone mad.

20
00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:45.365
They are...

21
00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:48.605
your real parents, Ji An.

22
00:01:52.074 --> 00:01:53.204
Eun Seok.

23
00:02:00.844 --> 00:02:02.285
On your 20th birthday,

24
00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:04.755
I bought this for your university admission.

25
00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:07.525
Take it. It's your allowance.

26
00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:10.024
I waited 25 years for this moment.

27
00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:16.824
What should I do?

28
00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:19.864
What should I do?

29
00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:28.945
How could you? What should I do?

30
00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:31.715
What should I do, Mom and Dad?

31
00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:34.744
What am I supposed to do now?

32
00:02:36.084 --> 00:02:37.584
What...

33
00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:50.535
Who's calling me now? Goodness.

34
00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:52.994
All right. Let me see.

35
00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:56.165
(Hae Ja)

36
00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:58.435
Yes, Hae Ja. What is it?

37
00:02:58.435 --> 00:03:01.644
Mi Jung, you left Ji Soo's stuff in my car.

38
00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:03.274
Oh, I must've forgotten.

39
00:03:03.274 --> 00:03:04.875
I would have brought it to you,

40
00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:07.084
but I'm changing our water purifier's filter today.

41
00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:09.744
It's okay. I'm on my way now. Okay.

42
00:03:24.294 --> 00:03:27.364
(Manager Jo Tae Gil)

43
00:03:35.244 --> 00:03:36.445
Yes, Manager Jo.

44
00:03:36.744 --> 00:03:37.774
Ji An.

45
00:03:37.774 --> 00:03:40.345
Where did you put the 2009 data for Haesung FNB?

46
00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:44.885
That must be in the data room.

47
00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:48.285
Ha Jung searched there, but she couldn't find it.

48
00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:51.195
I'm sorry, but come in and find the data.

49
00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:53.225
Someone from FNB will come for the data soon.

50
00:03:55.225 --> 00:03:57.494
Okay. I'll be on my way now.

51
00:04:16.384 --> 00:04:17.855
- Here. - Thanks.

52
00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:21.684
Hey, this just came to my mind.

53
00:04:21.684 --> 00:04:22.754
You said you don't want...

54
00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:24.294
to tell your children about the restaurant.

55
00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:26.054
Then don't tell them.

56
00:04:26.054 --> 00:04:27.465
What do you mean?

57
00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:29.265
You said Tae Soo is so against it.

58
00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:30.494
It will just cause trouble.

59
00:04:30.494 --> 00:04:32.165
Just open the restaurant first.

60
00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:33.804
Wait, no.

61
00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:36.504
Just tell them that you got a job.

62
00:04:36.864 --> 00:04:38.575
- A job? - Yes.

63
00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:43.715
In Vietnam, 80 percent of health supplements...

64
00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:46.814
are imported from overseas now.

65
00:04:46.814 --> 00:04:50.044
Most of the supplements are from the US and Korea.

66
00:04:50.684 --> 00:04:52.585
I did hear something about that.

67
00:04:52.754 --> 00:04:56.254
If you're interested in this business,

68
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.554
I assure you I'll export your products to Vietnam.

69
00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:01.725
Our headquarters is in Vietnam.

70
00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:04.494
Let's see that company of yours.

71
00:05:04.665 --> 00:05:06.294
See what?

72
00:05:07.335 --> 00:05:08.934
Your business card.

73
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.575
I must know who you are and where you work for...

74
00:05:11.575 --> 00:05:14.244
to consider your offer.

75
00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:17.944
I don't have a business card yet.

76
00:05:18.674 --> 00:05:20.614
You said your headquarters is in Vietnam.

77
00:05:20.614 --> 00:05:21.944
And yet, you don't have a business card?

78
00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:22.944
No, I don't.

79
00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:36.424
I call myself a businessman,

80
00:05:36.424 --> 00:05:39.194
but how can I forget about the basics? Gosh.

81
00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:44.905
Wait.

82
00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:48.575
Hey, Seok Doo.

83
00:05:48.575 --> 00:05:51.015
Tae Soo, I looked over the data you sent me.

84
00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:53.145
The hearing aids won't be profitable.

85
00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:55.345
A lot of people do have difficulties in hearing,

86
00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:59.085
but there are only a few who can afford them.

87
00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:00.725
Right.

88
00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:03.994
I did think that Vietnam's economy isn't so good.

89
00:06:04.294 --> 00:06:06.025
I'll tell you more after I look over the others.

90
00:06:06.025 --> 00:06:07.325
Sure, sure. Don't worry.

91
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.494
I can look for other potential products.

92
00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:12.494
Hey, and I think I need some business cards.

93
00:06:15.064 --> 00:06:16.535
What do you mean?

94
00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:19.234
You want to move up the 40th anniversary event...

95
00:06:19.234 --> 00:06:21.645
a month before the 40th anniversary?

96
00:06:21.645 --> 00:06:23.775
A suggestion came up in the marketing meeting.

97
00:06:23.775 --> 00:06:26.145
It's linked to the sales of our winter products.

98
00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:28.444
I've accepted it as it was a reasonable suggestion.

99
00:06:28.444 --> 00:06:30.884
You're not to judge if it's reasonable or not.

100
00:06:31.415 --> 00:06:33.114
Don't you think it's my decision to do so?

101
00:06:33.955 --> 00:06:35.884
And if it's directly linked to our sales,

102
00:06:35.884 --> 00:06:38.194
we must discuss about it with our branches.

103
00:06:38.194 --> 00:06:41.124
It's an important matter. How can you decide alone?

104
00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:45.595
Disregarding the chain of command is unacceptable.

105
00:06:45.794 --> 00:06:48.734
I'm sorry. I didn't think that far.

106
00:06:48.734 --> 00:06:51.674
Bring me a detailed report so I can understand...

107
00:06:52.004 --> 00:06:54.705
why we must move up the date of the event.

108
00:06:55.475 --> 00:06:58.544
Yes, sir. I'll bring it up as soon as possible.

109
00:07:03.984 --> 00:07:05.054
That was odd.

110
00:07:06.155 --> 00:07:09.355
It's not like him to show his feelings so visibly.

111
00:07:14.994 --> 00:07:16.025
Yes, Vice President Choi.

112
00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.434
Tell Ms. Seo to improve the proposal...

113
00:07:19.434 --> 00:07:21.035
for the anniversary event.

114
00:07:26.535 --> 00:07:27.705
(Haesung FNB, 2009)

115
00:07:35.915 --> 00:07:38.484
(Report on Customer Satisfaction Evaluations)

116
00:07:41.384 --> 00:07:43.254
Give it to me. Give it.

117
00:07:43.794 --> 00:07:45.855
No, that's fine, sir.

118
00:07:46.124 --> 00:07:48.525
- It's the data for 2009. - I see.

119
00:07:48.564 --> 00:07:49.864
Ask the men...

120
00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:51.895
to carry such heavy boxes next time.

121
00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:54.734
It looks like you found it somehow.

122
00:07:56.504 --> 00:07:59.105
Manager Jo, I think I have to go out again.

123
00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:00.335
No, you can't.

124
00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.775
The proposal for the anniversary event.

125
00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:05.814
You have to draft one for the president's approval.

126
00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:09.415
The reason for moving up the date seems critical.

127
00:08:09.915 --> 00:08:11.355
Can you do it by tomorrow afternoon?

128
00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:13.515
It's a direct order from the vice president.

129
00:08:14.124 --> 00:08:16.684
I see. I'll work on it.

130
00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:19.595
This is a major event.

131
00:08:19.655 --> 00:08:21.325
Your role will be extremely important.

132
00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:24.035
Okay.

133
00:08:24.835 --> 00:08:26.095
Mom.

134
00:08:27.564 --> 00:08:29.905
Wait. What are those?

135
00:08:32.374 --> 00:08:33.874
You didn't throw this out?

136
00:08:34.244 --> 00:08:37.445
You bought it when you first learned how to bake.

137
00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:39.414
You said you sold all of these off...

138
00:08:39.414 --> 00:08:41.144
and used up the money from them.

139
00:08:41.144 --> 00:08:43.014
I was trying to stop you from baking because...

140
00:08:43.014 --> 00:08:44.715
you were wasting your job as a dental hygienist.

141
00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:48.325
I couldn't put up with it due to my weak stomach.

142
00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:50.595
The insides of people's mouths are disgusting.

143
00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:53.095
Okay. Anyway,

144
00:08:53.524 --> 00:08:55.965
you got a job at a bakery. Do your best.

145
00:08:56.595 --> 00:08:58.595
I was going to bake some bread today,

146
00:08:58.595 --> 00:09:00.095
so I bought these disposable pans.

147
00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:01.764
Thank you, Mom. Thank you.

148
00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:29.825
(Plain Bread)

149
00:09:35.965 --> 00:09:39.335
I'm sure that Mr. Baker didn't use sweet pumpkin.

150
00:09:46.345 --> 00:09:48.215
Since you just opened,

151
00:09:48.215 --> 00:09:50.555
I don't think the wires would be the problem.

152
00:09:51.414 --> 00:09:54.185
Oh, I see. There are dregs from the coffee here.

153
00:09:54.585 --> 00:09:55.654
Right here.

154
00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:04.034
I guess you haven't had your meal today.

155
00:10:04.034 --> 00:10:06.764
Yes, I had a lot of repairs today.

156
00:10:11.404 --> 00:10:12.575
Thank you.

157
00:10:24.484 --> 00:10:26.815
I'm sorry, but are you married?

158
00:10:28.984 --> 00:10:30.185
You aren't, right?

159
00:10:30.654 --> 00:10:33.725
No, it's not that.

160
00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:35.725
Or you've been married before?

161
00:10:36.994 --> 00:10:38.795
Oh, I see.

162
00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:41.864
What's wrong with that? That's nothing these days.

163
00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:45.805
If you're done eating, you can leave the plate.

164
00:10:52.774 --> 00:10:55.014
Do you clean the grinder for the coffee often?

165
00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:57.055
I do it every day.

166
00:10:57.055 --> 00:10:59.384
But still, if you brew a lot of coffee,

167
00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:01.024
you must take good care of it.

168
00:11:01.585 --> 00:11:02.585
Okay.

169
00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.955
I'm 39 years old.

170
00:11:07.264 --> 00:11:08.795
Are you done with your food?

171
00:11:10.664 --> 00:11:12.065
- I'll do it. - Gosh!

172
00:11:14.234 --> 00:11:15.264
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:17.404
Goodbye.

174
00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:22.205
Let me. Please.

175
00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:24.514
No, you can just leave.

176
00:11:24.514 --> 00:11:26.575
- But you treated me. - I said it's fine!

177
00:11:26.575 --> 00:11:27.884
Please leave!

178
00:11:32.654 --> 00:11:33.654
Excuse me,

179
00:11:34.254 --> 00:11:37.154
but what did I do wrong?

180
00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:39.325
- Why are you... - What's going on here?

181
00:11:51.734 --> 00:11:53.774
Ms. Sunwoo Hee divorced Mr. Cha Kyung Soo...

182
00:11:53.774 --> 00:11:54.945
five years ago.

183
00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:57.475
The reason for divorce was domestic violence.

184
00:12:06.555 --> 00:12:08.925
Gosh. You should have had a happy marriage.

185
00:12:15.764 --> 00:12:18.295
Why... Why?

186
00:12:21.764 --> 00:12:23.565
Darn it.

187
00:12:34.244 --> 00:12:35.514
This smells delicious.

188
00:12:36.914 --> 00:12:38.284
The smell of happiness.

189
00:12:48.664 --> 00:12:49.764
1, 2, 3.

190
00:12:53.364 --> 00:12:54.435
There you go.

191
00:12:55.504 --> 00:12:56.565
I'm home.

192
00:12:57.605 --> 00:13:00.175
Eun Seok called Ms. Min that she'll be late.

193
00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:01.374
Why is she so busy?

194
00:13:01.545 --> 00:13:03.404
It's because I asked her for a favor.

195
00:13:04.014 --> 00:13:05.045
What did you ask her to do?

196
00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:07.345
Uncle wanted to confirm the proposal himself,

197
00:13:07.585 --> 00:13:09.114
so her proposal needed to be improved.

198
00:13:09.845 --> 00:13:11.014
Your uncle did that?

199
00:13:17.394 --> 00:13:19.254
Give out white t-shirts for free.

200
00:13:19.254 --> 00:13:21.595
It will positively affect the sales at the shop.

201
00:13:22.095 --> 00:13:25.465
The events will be held at the park and our shops.

202
00:13:35.605 --> 00:13:38.144
In the proposal for our 40th anniversary event,

203
00:13:38.144 --> 00:13:40.514
there are several suggestions for...

204
00:13:52.595 --> 00:13:53.795
We've arrived, ma'am.

205
00:14:14.014 --> 00:14:16.815
I wish this road would never end.

206
00:14:30.795 --> 00:14:31.835
Eun Seok.

207
00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:39.335
What's wrong?

208
00:14:39.805 --> 00:14:41.345
Why did you turn back?

209
00:14:42.605 --> 00:14:43.774
Well...

210
00:14:44.845 --> 00:14:47.614
I thought I'd go and get some air.

211
00:14:47.984 --> 00:14:49.445
But it's past midnight.

212
00:14:50.144 --> 00:14:53.315
But why are you outside when it's past midnight?

213
00:14:53.514 --> 00:14:55.654
I was the one who made you come home late.

214
00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:59.055
I know you are very stressed out,

215
00:14:59.055 --> 00:15:00.825
but how can you drink beer at this hour?

216
00:15:04.264 --> 00:15:06.664
And I can't make someone to follow you around.

217
00:15:07.465 --> 00:15:10.205
I am very worried about my unpredictable sister.

218
00:15:11.504 --> 00:15:13.605
Most people in this world...

219
00:15:15.075 --> 00:15:16.345
live like this.

220
00:15:16.744 --> 00:15:18.744
But you don't belong to that group.

221
00:15:19.575 --> 00:15:21.114
Is it still not clear?

222
00:15:22.815 --> 00:15:25.355
Right. I almost forgot.

223
00:15:25.914 --> 00:15:28.024
I got this from the second vendor.

224
00:15:28.725 --> 00:15:29.754
Is that right?

225
00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:32.154
But it's too dark to read.

226
00:15:32.154 --> 00:15:34.124
I'm tired. I'll go in now.

227
00:15:34.664 --> 00:15:35.795
What?

228
00:16:04.925 --> 00:16:06.254
Where is Eun Seok?

229
00:16:06.524 --> 00:16:08.465
She left at 5am.

230
00:16:08.465 --> 00:16:10.734
She had to go somewhere to do some research.

231
00:16:11.565 --> 00:16:12.965
5am?

232
00:16:13.595 --> 00:16:15.435
Why is she working so hard?

233
00:16:16.105 --> 00:16:17.534
It's because she got your mom's blood.

234
00:16:17.874 --> 00:16:20.805
She's driven, and she never gives up.

235
00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:24.215
She's trying to make sure her proposal passes...

236
00:16:24.514 --> 00:16:26.914
so she can save her brother's reputation.

237
00:16:27.284 --> 00:16:30.455
After the proposal passes, I should give her a break.

238
00:16:30.585 --> 00:16:31.585
You should.

239
00:16:31.784 --> 00:16:33.855
She's just passing through the marketing department.

240
00:16:34.085 --> 00:16:35.654
Tell her that she doesn't need to try too hard.

241
00:16:35.884 --> 00:16:38.055
Grandfather told her to make a contribution.

242
00:16:38.425 --> 00:16:40.154
Besides, it's the 40th anniversary event.

243
00:16:40.154 --> 00:16:41.565
It's only natural that she would feel pressured.

244
00:16:42.764 --> 00:16:45.835
Why don't you buy Eun Seok lunch and tell her that?

245
00:16:47.504 --> 00:16:48.935
I won't be going in today.

246
00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:50.705
Why not?

247
00:16:51.575 --> 00:16:53.105
I got something to take care of at home.

248
00:16:57.345 --> 00:16:58.874
The analysis results of winter product sales...

249
00:16:58.874 --> 00:17:01.144
from the past three years...

250
00:17:01.144 --> 00:17:03.984
prove that sales increase as the season changes...

251
00:17:03.984 --> 00:17:05.884
between the end of October and the start of November.

252
00:17:10.224 --> 00:17:12.855
Gosh, I thought nobody was in yet.

253
00:17:26.134 --> 00:17:29.775
How is it? I made it with my own recipe.

254
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.315
It's delicious.

255
00:17:31.644 --> 00:17:33.644
Is it delicious? What do you think, Mom?

256
00:17:34.444 --> 00:17:36.485
What did you put in it to make it so soft?

257
00:17:37.454 --> 00:17:38.585
It's my secret.

258
00:17:39.654 --> 00:17:41.624
How could you keep that a secret?

259
00:17:42.224 --> 00:17:44.194
I'm trying to copy Mr. Baker's recipe.

260
00:17:45.025 --> 00:17:47.295
By the way, why do you call him that?

261
00:17:47.495 --> 00:17:50.224
He's the baker, so I call him Mr. Baker.

262
00:17:50.224 --> 00:17:52.894
I'm supposed to call him Boss, but he hates that.

263
00:17:52.894 --> 00:17:55.265
So he told me to call him "Mr. Baker".

264
00:17:57.505 --> 00:17:58.974
Why are you so quiet?

265
00:18:00.575 --> 00:18:03.005
You could be a baker if you keep trying.

266
00:18:04.545 --> 00:18:06.144
All the other cuisines don't matter to me.

267
00:18:06.614 --> 00:18:07.845
This is the real deal.

268
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:09.985
To get a chance to work there, I got in line...

269
00:18:09.985 --> 00:18:11.855
every day as the first customer for three months.

270
00:18:14.454 --> 00:18:16.184
Ji An should try this too.

271
00:18:17.124 --> 00:18:19.325
Right. Ji An came to see me.

272
00:18:19.954 --> 00:18:22.124
She got into the Marketing Team.

273
00:18:31.204 --> 00:18:32.835
I am here, Mr. Baker.

274
00:18:35.644 --> 00:18:36.845
Start packing from over there.

275
00:18:36.845 --> 00:18:37.845
Okay.

276
00:18:39.714 --> 00:18:42.184
Are these all?

277
00:18:42.345 --> 00:18:44.055
Why did you bake so little?

278
00:18:44.454 --> 00:18:45.954
I wanted to bake only a little.

279
00:18:46.785 --> 00:18:49.025
You can't do that.

280
00:18:49.154 --> 00:18:52.724
Some people come from afar to get your bread.

281
00:18:52.724 --> 00:18:56.424
I don't make bread to please other people.

282
00:18:57.035 --> 00:18:58.164
Then why do you?

283
00:18:58.265 --> 00:19:00.035
Gosh. Just get to work.

284
00:19:00.864 --> 00:19:01.964
Okay.

285
00:19:03.105 --> 00:19:06.735
Right. Ms. Sunwoo asked for your bank details...

286
00:19:06.735 --> 00:19:08.505
so she can pay you for the bread.

287
00:19:09.874 --> 00:19:10.974
Bank details?

288
00:19:11.214 --> 00:19:14.015
I can just send her the invoice, right?

289
00:19:14.015 --> 00:19:16.414
Tell her to send it to your account.

290
00:19:16.884 --> 00:19:18.114
- My account? - Yes.

291
00:19:18.114 --> 00:19:19.585
- Why? - What?

292
00:19:20.454 --> 00:19:23.355
I need cash. That's all.

293
00:19:23.555 --> 00:19:26.025
But we get cash every day.

294
00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:28.424
I am desperate for cash.

295
00:19:28.565 --> 00:19:29.724
Are you satisfied now?

296
00:19:31.664 --> 00:19:32.894
Just pack these.

297
00:19:33.495 --> 00:19:34.505
Okay.

298
00:19:36.035 --> 00:19:37.934
Why are these here?

299
00:19:38.204 --> 00:19:41.045
I'll send a taxi again. Just take that, and come.

300
00:19:41.644 --> 00:19:44.614
Oh, no. I already ordered food.

301
00:19:44.775 --> 00:19:49.015
Are you giving up wild eel for delivery food?

302
00:19:49.515 --> 00:19:52.785
It's not good if people see us outside together.

303
00:19:52.884 --> 00:19:55.325
And I can't have lunch break for too long.

304
00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:58.154
You are more careful than I am.

305
00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:01.224
I think my food is here. I have to go.

306
00:20:08.565 --> 00:20:11.575
Gi Jae, I will eat lunch with you.

307
00:20:11.634 --> 00:20:13.005
But you said you can't.

308
00:20:13.374 --> 00:20:15.204
You asked me to pay you back.

309
00:20:17.315 --> 00:20:18.515
Aren't you going to tell me?

310
00:20:19.414 --> 00:20:23.085
You have a shopper. Why did you ask for mine?

311
00:20:23.954 --> 00:20:26.355
You asked for about 10 women's outfits,

312
00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:29.924
shoes, bags, and even accessories.

313
00:20:30.325 --> 00:20:32.825
You should fire that one. She's got a cheap mouth.

314
00:20:33.055 --> 00:20:35.624
If she doesn't answer my questions, she's out.

315
00:20:36.325 --> 00:20:38.634
You think I'm in some kind of a secret relationship,

316
00:20:38.765 --> 00:20:41.204
but I am not. So just wait a few months.

317
00:20:41.765 --> 00:20:44.805
Just a few months? What is this about?

318
00:20:45.005 --> 00:20:47.474
By the way, what was your dream job?

319
00:20:48.174 --> 00:20:49.275
My dream job?

320
00:20:49.474 --> 00:20:52.045
What did you write down when you were young?

321
00:20:52.114 --> 00:20:54.214
You wrote "president" and "chairman" too, right?

322
00:20:54.944 --> 00:20:56.214
When I was in high school,

323
00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.614
I ran away from home to be a fashion designer.

324
00:20:58.985 --> 00:21:00.085
You?

325
00:21:00.315 --> 00:21:02.485
I succeeded to get on a plane to Paris,

326
00:21:02.525 --> 00:21:03.954
but I got caught at the airport there...

327
00:21:03.954 --> 00:21:05.924
and got shoved into the plane coming back.

328
00:21:06.194 --> 00:21:08.295
But you were such a good student back then.

329
00:21:08.295 --> 00:21:10.464
How could you do such a ridiculous thing?

330
00:21:11.295 --> 00:21:13.595
The son of Sungho Medical being a fashion designer?

331
00:21:14.434 --> 00:21:17.204
But you wanted to become a war photographer.

332
00:21:18.305 --> 00:21:19.374
Me?

333
00:21:19.835 --> 00:21:22.275
Were you in 8th grade or 9th grade back then?

334
00:21:22.674 --> 00:21:24.545
You fell in love with Robert Capa's photograph.

335
00:21:25.775 --> 00:21:27.714
- "The Falling Soldier". - Yes.

336
00:21:27.845 --> 00:21:30.414
"The true journalism is in the battlefield."

337
00:21:30.515 --> 00:21:31.815
Do you remember that?

338
00:21:32.315 --> 00:21:35.355
I was immature back then. That wasn't my dream job.

339
00:21:36.025 --> 00:21:39.295
And Robert Capa was a handsome man.

340
00:21:39.295 --> 00:21:40.664
That's why I said that.

341
00:21:55.904 --> 00:21:57.644
Keep this in case of emergency.

342
00:22:17.864 --> 00:22:19.095
No, Ji An.

343
00:22:19.265 --> 00:22:21.464
If you reveal that now, we will all die.

344
00:22:21.805 --> 00:22:23.775
Just ask them to send you abroad.

345
00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.775
We can't help it now.

346
00:22:25.835 --> 00:22:28.305
I know I shouldn't have done it.

347
00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:30.345
But it was all for you.

348
00:22:30.545 --> 00:22:32.815
Mom.

349
00:22:41.355 --> 00:22:43.255
Made by Ji Soo.

350
00:23:08.144 --> 00:23:09.285
(Are you finally an apprentice?)

351
00:23:16.154 --> 00:23:17.755
Are you finally an apprentice?

352
00:23:18.954 --> 00:23:19.995
What's this?

353
00:23:21.325 --> 00:23:25.795
I knew she's the only one who recognizes my talent.

354
00:23:27.235 --> 00:23:28.235
(Ji An)

355
00:23:30.404 --> 00:23:31.404
(Whiner)

356
00:23:35.545 --> 00:23:36.545
Hey.

357
00:23:36.545 --> 00:23:38.315
It looks great, doesn't it?

358
00:23:38.315 --> 00:23:40.414
I really made that myself.

359
00:23:42.745 --> 00:23:44.454
Did you really make that?

360
00:23:44.855 --> 00:23:46.714
It's just like the bread they sell at a bakery.

361
00:23:46.714 --> 00:23:47.724
Right?

362
00:23:47.724 --> 00:23:50.724
Dad bought me an oven. I made it with that,

363
00:23:50.724 --> 00:23:53.224
and Dad ate my bread for breakfast.

364
00:23:53.864 --> 00:23:55.964
Did Dad finish working at the Daejeon site?

365
00:23:56.394 --> 00:23:59.694
No. He came back before it ended.

366
00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:03.634
He hurt his arm, so he had to quit.

367
00:24:05.434 --> 00:24:06.474
Is that right?

368
00:24:08.345 --> 00:24:10.874
Okay. Go, and work. I'll hang up now.

369
00:24:15.684 --> 00:24:17.355
Dad.

370
00:24:19.714 --> 00:24:20.954
Ji An,

371
00:24:21.855 --> 00:24:22.924
you must not...

372
00:24:23.855 --> 00:24:25.255
go to them.

373
00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:26.954
Why do you want to stop me?

374
00:24:26.954 --> 00:24:28.565
Why shouldn't I go?

375
00:24:28.565 --> 00:24:31.235
When other people ignore me and despise me,

376
00:24:31.235 --> 00:24:34.164
it makes me so miserable, poor, and servile.

377
00:24:34.164 --> 00:24:36.164
I can't stand it anymore.

378
00:24:39.735 --> 00:24:41.545
Why can't I be a daughter of a rich family?

379
00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:43.775
My real parents are conglomerates.

380
00:24:43.874 --> 00:24:46.414
Why can't I go when they're rich?

381
00:24:46.845 --> 00:24:47.884
I mean,

382
00:24:48.444 --> 00:24:51.454
why did you even pick me up in the first place?

383
00:24:51.454 --> 00:24:53.154
No matter how much I tried,

384
00:24:53.884 --> 00:24:55.684
I was already disqualified.

385
00:24:55.684 --> 00:24:57.325
I already don't have good grades or qualifications.

386
00:24:57.325 --> 00:24:59.025
How could I get good grades...

387
00:24:59.025 --> 00:25:01.224
when I was working at the same time?

388
00:25:01.224 --> 00:25:03.095
How can I win against kids who got pocket money,

389
00:25:03.095 --> 00:25:05.335
had private lessons, and studied abroad?

390
00:25:05.335 --> 00:25:07.364
Dad collapsed while chasing after you.

391
00:25:07.364 --> 00:25:09.934
He was following your car, but you ignored him.

392
00:25:32.025 --> 00:25:33.555
Look at her.

393
00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:36.265
She lied about the delivery food.

394
00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:39.664
Does she like that work that much?

395
00:25:41.065 --> 00:25:42.735
It wasn't her dream job anyway.

396
00:25:44.305 --> 00:25:45.535
Seriously.

397
00:25:58.684 --> 00:25:59.714
Here you go.

398
00:26:02.325 --> 00:26:04.355
I couldn't believe it when you said...

399
00:26:04.355 --> 00:26:05.595
you were going to treat me a cup of cafe latte.

400
00:26:05.595 --> 00:26:07.265
Don't look down on the vending machine.

401
00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:09.765
From latte to espresso, it's got everything.

402
00:26:09.765 --> 00:26:10.765
Are you kidding me?

403
00:26:11.694 --> 00:26:14.565
You always drink 30-cent vending machine coffee.

404
00:26:14.565 --> 00:26:16.204
So how much did you manage to save?

405
00:26:16.565 --> 00:26:18.204
Why would you want to know that?

406
00:26:18.704 --> 00:26:21.174
You must've saved a lot. How much...

407
00:26:21.245 --> 00:26:22.505
Did you already save 100,000 dollars?

408
00:26:22.505 --> 00:26:24.075
I got discharged from the army only a year ago.

409
00:26:24.075 --> 00:26:25.214
How could I have saved 100,000 dollars?

410
00:26:25.214 --> 00:26:26.614
Is 100,000 dollars a joke?

411
00:26:26.614 --> 00:26:29.745
You said you get paid well working as a waiter.

412
00:26:30.184 --> 00:26:32.985
Well, if you consider my university tuition saved,

413
00:26:32.985 --> 00:26:34.684
you could say I saved about that much.

414
00:26:34.684 --> 00:26:35.684
What?

415
00:26:35.825 --> 00:26:36.924
Look.

416
00:26:37.454 --> 00:26:41.864
1 year is 365 days. 4 years are 1460 days.

417
00:26:41.864 --> 00:26:45.464
If you spend 10 dollars a day for 1460 days,

418
00:26:45.464 --> 00:26:46.995
the total sum is 14,600 dollars.

419
00:26:47.265 --> 00:26:48.964
But you don't just use 10 dollars a day.

420
00:26:49.235 --> 00:26:50.634
Anyway,

421
00:26:50.634 --> 00:26:53.134
one semester of university costs 5,000 dollars.

422
00:26:53.134 --> 00:26:55.204
Multiply that by 8 and it becomes 40,000 dollars.

423
00:26:55.204 --> 00:26:56.805
If you combine everything, it becomes 60,000 dollars.

424
00:26:56.805 --> 00:26:58.545
And that's the minimum amount.

425
00:26:58.545 --> 00:27:02.745
If you work two jobs for four years,

426
00:27:04.214 --> 00:27:06.914
It's not 100,000 dollars. It's over 200,000 dollars.

427
00:27:08.285 --> 00:27:09.384
Really?

428
00:27:10.825 --> 00:27:12.224
If I start a business with 200,000 dollars,

429
00:27:12.224 --> 00:27:13.624
10 years later,

430
00:27:15.065 --> 00:27:17.265
I would be able to hire university graduates.

431
00:27:18.134 --> 00:27:20.134
But I would still go to university.

432
00:27:20.134 --> 00:27:21.605
Many people in this country...

433
00:27:21.605 --> 00:27:24.075
don't treat those who have no degree as humans.

434
00:27:24.335 --> 00:27:26.535
I won't treat them as humans either.

435
00:27:26.535 --> 00:27:27.874
Will I not be a human...

436
00:27:27.874 --> 00:27:29.204
if people don't treat me like a human?

437
00:27:29.204 --> 00:27:32.414
You're so good at talking, aren't you?

438

Here's the proposal.

451
00:28:04.714 --> 00:28:06.545
You must've worked really hard.

452

Did she finish already?

455
00:28:19.755 --> 00:28:20.795
Yes.

456
00:28:21.095 --> 00:28:22.964
I pushed Ms. Seo...

457
00:28:22.964 --> 00:28:26.894
to finish it by this afternoon.

458
00:28:27.765 --> 00:28:29.565
Why did you push her?

459
00:28:30.605 --> 00:28:33.204
I thought you were in a rush.

460
00:28:33.204 --> 00:28:35.374
Did I tell you to rush it?

461
00:28:36.904 --> 00:28:39.245
You didn't tell me directly.

462
00:28:39.275 --> 00:28:41.444
Can you communicate through telepathy?

463
00:28:42.085 --> 00:28:44.154
No, I can't.

464
00:28:44.154 --> 00:28:46.184
You can't communicate through telepathy.

465
00:28:46.184 --> 00:28:48.585
I don't want to know about why you thought...

466
00:28:48.585 --> 00:28:50.394
that I was in a rush.

467
00:28:51.694 --> 00:28:53.194
What I want to know...

468
00:28:53.194 --> 00:28:54.964
is why you finished your work...

473
00:29:04.904 --> 00:29:06.605
to have this finished by now.

474
00:29:07.174 --> 00:29:09.374
Don't tell me you didn't know that.

475
00:29:09.845 --> 00:29:11.444
I was just being considerate of my boss.

476
00:29:11.444 --> 00:29:13.045
And you don't care about your staff.

477
00:29:16.545 --> 00:29:17.755
You may go.

478
00:29:20.154 --> 00:29:21.224
Okay.

I can do it.

I must do it. I must do it.

You've gone all haughty because you're doing well.

Why would you leave your phone at the office...

484
00:29:46.644 --> 00:29:48.384
and make me come to find you?

485

488

- Take it out. - You take it out.

502
00:30:53.614 --> 00:30:54.845
You're so bad at staring,

503
00:30:54.845 --> 00:30:56.745
but you always challenge me.

504
00:30:58.985 --> 00:31:00.085
Goodness.

No, they are screening "Casablanca".

508
00:31:14.735 --> 00:31:16.605
You said it's your favorite movie.

509
00:31:18.374 --> 00:31:20.275
Why? Are you going to apply...

510
00:31:20.275 --> 00:31:21.704
and take me to see it?

511
00:31:21.704 --> 00:31:23.605
I might die from embarrassment.

512
00:31:23.644 --> 00:31:26.444
Who would do this for two movie tickets?

513
00:31:26.815 --> 00:31:28.144
I'd rather not see it.

514
00:31:31.315 --> 00:31:32.414
Soo A,

515
00:31:32.785 --> 00:31:35.825
I got the tickets to "Casablanca".

516
00:31:37.424 --> 00:31:39.154
I think you should take them.

517
00:31:40.325 --> 00:31:42.164
I will hand it to you on the rooftop.

518
00:31:42.525 --> 00:31:44.265
So tell me when you can spare me some time.

519
00:31:57.974 --> 00:31:59.345
Ji Ho.

520
00:31:59.345 --> 00:32:00.444
Hey, Dad.

521
00:32:01.114 --> 00:32:02.184
Hey.

522
00:32:03.144 --> 00:32:04.285
- Have you finished? - Yes.

523
00:32:04.285 --> 00:32:05.384
What are you doing here?

524
00:32:05.384 --> 00:32:06.884
I've come to buy you dinner.

525
00:32:07.855 --> 00:32:09.585
- Let's go. - Okay.

526
00:32:09.884 --> 00:32:10.995
All right.

527
00:32:11.995 --> 00:32:12.995
You're being silly.

528
00:32:12.995 --> 00:32:15.525
All you wanted was just some dakgalbi?

529
00:32:15.864 --> 00:32:18.364
It's been a year since I bought you dinner.

530
00:32:19.035 --> 00:32:20.295
I bet Ji An did the same.

531
00:32:21.035 --> 00:32:24.735
You're brainwashed that expensive food is good.

532
00:32:24.735 --> 00:32:27.704
To taste really good foods, trust your tongue.

533
00:32:28.704 --> 00:32:32.474
All right. This restaurant is good. It's delicious.

534
00:32:32.545 --> 00:32:33.985
Have some more.

535
00:32:35.684 --> 00:32:40.055
I wonder why you wanted to have dinner with me.

536
00:32:40.384 --> 00:32:41.525
So I can't really enjoy it.

537
00:32:44.224 --> 00:32:45.355
I should've...

538
00:32:45.995 --> 00:32:48.924
asked for your understanding first.

539
00:32:51.864 --> 00:32:53.235
Since you moved out,

540
00:32:53.934 --> 00:32:55.364
I told Ji Tae...

541
00:32:56.164 --> 00:32:58.575
to get married and stay in your room.

542
00:32:59.204 --> 00:33:00.235
Did he say yes?

543
00:33:01.474 --> 00:33:03.345
Why not? He's got a room.

544
00:33:04.345 --> 00:33:07.845
You'll move in again after the exam.

545
00:33:09.384 --> 00:33:10.785
So I was wondering...

546
00:33:13.085 --> 00:33:14.154
if you could...

547
00:33:14.985 --> 00:33:17.325
tell Ji Tae to get married. Could you?

548
00:33:18.724 --> 00:33:20.565
- Me? - Yes.

549
00:33:20.995 --> 00:33:23.795
You are still young. You can get by...

550
00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:26.765
living in a gosiwon for a while, right?

551
00:33:28.704 --> 00:33:32.035
I'll take care of your rent, okay?

552
00:33:32.775 --> 00:33:36.444
So let's get Ji Tae married.

553
00:33:37.444 --> 00:33:39.414
Okay. Don't worry about it.

554
00:33:40.245 --> 00:33:43.214
I don't think Ji Tae will listen to me,

555
00:33:43.714 --> 00:33:46.954
but I have this mysterious power...

556
00:33:47.555 --> 00:33:49.285
to move people's hearts.

557
00:33:50.755 --> 00:33:51.954
Gosh.

558
00:33:54.124 --> 00:33:55.964
- Ji Ho. - Yes?

559
00:33:57.595 --> 00:34:00.194
I'll do anything to make you...

560
00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:02.765
not need to work for your university tuition...

561
00:34:07.275 --> 00:34:08.345
All right.

562
00:34:08.874 --> 00:34:12.474
I'll work hard,

563
00:34:12.815 --> 00:34:15.715
so you must live the life you always dreamt of.

564
00:34:15.715 --> 00:34:17.115
Don't give up, okay?

565
00:34:17.485 --> 00:34:19.615
There's no other Seo Ji Ho under the sun.

566
00:34:19.784 --> 00:34:21.755
And you only live once.

567
00:34:23.284 --> 00:34:27.324
Exactly. You know what? I adore myself.

568
00:34:27.664 --> 00:34:30.835
Why would I stop myself from doing what I want?

569
00:34:31.965 --> 00:34:34.865
Don't worry, and be happy.

570
00:34:36.704 --> 00:34:38.275
It's good to see you being so high-spirited.

571
00:34:42.545 --> 00:34:44.874
Can I have another bottle of soju?

572
00:35:03.124 --> 00:35:04.494
Why today?

573
00:35:06.365 --> 00:35:07.565
What should I do?

574
00:35:12.405 --> 00:35:13.844
Hello?

575
00:35:14.704 --> 00:35:16.275
You're Ms. No's daughter.

576
00:35:16.704 --> 00:35:18.474
It's nice to see you again.

577
00:35:20.144 --> 00:35:21.485
You too.

578
00:35:22.244 --> 00:35:24.184
Are you here to see my mother?

579
00:35:24.184 --> 00:35:27.085
What? Well... Yes.

580
00:35:27.385 --> 00:35:29.124
I brought some wild ginseng.

581
00:35:32.054 --> 00:35:33.124
Okay.

582
00:35:38.795 --> 00:35:40.295
I'm home.

583
00:35:41.034 --> 00:35:42.704
Why are you home so early today?

584
00:35:44.534 --> 00:35:47.675
Well, we have a visitor.

585
00:35:53.275 --> 00:35:54.514
Ms. No.

586
00:35:56.344 --> 00:35:58.014
You didn't go home yet?

587
00:35:58.014 --> 00:36:01.385
I said I won't meet anyone and get some rest today.

588
00:36:04.355 --> 00:36:07.094
I've committed a grave sin. I made a mistake.

589
00:36:07.094 --> 00:36:08.664
I'm so sorry.

590
00:36:08.764 --> 00:36:10.365
Please forgive me.

591
00:36:10.365 --> 00:36:12.534
What are you doing? You're embarrassing me.

592
00:36:13.764 --> 00:36:16.605
Is it wrong to end my sponsorship?

593
00:36:17.735 --> 00:36:20.704
I just thought Taeyoung Foundation...

594
00:36:20.704 --> 00:36:22.204
would be a better choice than Mirae Foundation...

595
00:36:22.505 --> 00:36:26.014
to support poor students who are gifted in arts.

596
00:36:26.014 --> 00:36:28.184
I just did as I was told by Ms. No Jin Hee.

597
00:36:28.585 --> 00:36:29.585
She wanted me...

598
00:36:29.585 --> 00:36:31.454
to tell Shimsung that you found your daughter.

599
00:36:32.985 --> 00:36:35.085
Do you think I didn't know that?

600
00:36:35.525 --> 00:36:38.124
And she promised me.

601
00:36:38.425 --> 00:36:41.824
She'd never tell anyone about your daughter.

602
00:36:41.965 --> 00:36:43.735
Of course she wouldn't.

603
00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:46.365
She's the wife of Shimsung Corporation's owner.

604
00:36:46.365 --> 00:36:49.105
She wouldn't be so shallow to spread a rumor.

605
00:36:50.105 --> 00:36:51.574
If she did,

606
00:36:51.574 --> 00:36:54.945
she'd disgrace herself and her company.

607
00:36:55.644 --> 00:36:58.514
The construction of our boarding school stopped.

608
00:36:59.675 --> 00:37:02.184
Without the donation you promised,

609
00:37:02.815 --> 00:37:05.355
we won't be able to pay for the construction.

610
00:37:05.355 --> 00:37:06.985
Then you'd go bankrupt.

611
00:37:07.885 --> 00:37:10.255
We put up the building because you promised us.

612
00:37:10.255 --> 00:37:13.355
I didn't promise anything. I said I'd wait and see.

613
00:37:13.594 --> 00:37:15.425
You've always sponsored our foundation...

614
00:37:15.724 --> 00:37:17.534
saying the same thing.

615
00:37:18.465 --> 00:37:21.764
When I said that,

616
00:37:22.465 --> 00:37:25.905
you didn't get on my nerves.

617
00:37:26.105 --> 00:37:27.874
So please...

618
00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:29.804
I really don't know why I did that.

619
00:37:30.574 --> 00:37:32.615
I just wanted to educate the children well.

620
00:37:32.615 --> 00:37:34.715
But I didn't have enough money for a new building.

621
00:37:36.115 --> 00:37:38.454
So I fell for Ms. No Jin Hee's words.

622
00:37:38.454 --> 00:37:41.985
It's not about education. It's about real estate.

623
00:37:43.054 --> 00:37:46.525
You bought the building site under your name.

624
00:37:46.894 --> 00:37:48.365
Well, it's...

625
00:37:49.164 --> 00:37:53.494
Ms. No, I'll be doomed without your donation.

626
00:37:54.264 --> 00:37:56.735
I put all my fortune into this.

627
00:37:58.034 --> 00:38:00.335
I even got a loan for this.

628
00:38:00.574 --> 00:38:01.905
And private loans too.

629
00:38:02.204 --> 00:38:04.744
To hold out until you get the money from me.

630
00:38:04.744 --> 00:38:06.374
Please help me just this once.

631
00:38:06.715 --> 00:38:09.545
Please forgive me for old time's sake.

632
00:38:10.485 --> 00:38:12.585
I know this is crying over spilt milk,

633
00:38:12.585 --> 00:38:14.324
but I was careless.

634
00:38:15.525 --> 00:38:16.885
I just needed to pay the construction fee.

635
00:38:16.885 --> 00:38:20.695
You knew it'd be no use crying over spilt milk.

636
00:38:22.164 --> 00:38:25.465
You didn't see this coming when you did that?

637
00:38:26.335 --> 00:38:29.434
When you supported them at the gallery,

638
00:38:29.835 --> 00:38:31.304
I knew it was you.

639
00:38:31.534 --> 00:38:34.445
Ms. No, introduce your daughter to us.

640
00:38:35.874 --> 00:38:39.374
How dare you deceive No Myung Hee unscathed?

641
00:38:40.175 --> 00:38:41.885
I've committed a grave sin.

642
00:38:43.885 --> 00:38:45.985
I'll do whatever you want.

643
00:38:45.985 --> 00:38:48.454
If you committed a grave sin, go into a grave.

644
00:38:48.885 --> 00:38:51.655
Your husband is retired. You blew all your money.

645
00:38:51.655 --> 00:38:53.594
And now, you're in debt.

646
00:38:54.624 --> 00:38:56.865
You'll have to live on your son's salary.

647
00:38:57.965 --> 00:39:01.635
Your second son in the sales team of Haesung FNB.

648
00:39:02.304 --> 00:39:03.775
Was it Hyun Soo?

649
00:39:04.605 --> 00:39:05.704
He's promoted to Assistant Manager...

650
00:39:05.704 --> 00:39:06.735
in our Planning Team.

651
00:39:07.175 --> 00:39:08.304
Pardon?

652
00:39:08.304 --> 00:39:12.744
But your first son will remain unemployed.

653
00:39:12.815 --> 00:39:15.315
Because No Jin Hee won't be able to get him...

654
00:39:15.315 --> 00:39:17.155
a position at Hotel MJ as she has promised.

655
00:39:18.085 --> 00:39:19.585
So you should retire...

656
00:39:20.255 --> 00:39:22.324
and cook for your son and husband at home.

657
00:39:22.425 --> 00:39:23.755
Ms. No.

658
00:39:25.355 --> 00:39:26.855
You, Jin So Mi.

659
00:39:27.295 --> 00:39:29.394
I know you have a temper and guts.

660
00:39:29.594 --> 00:39:33.664
If you dare talk about my daughter again,

661
00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:37.374
your second son will lose his job as well.

662
00:39:39.405 --> 00:39:40.804
Forever.

663
00:39:47.784 --> 00:39:50.615
Chairman Jin, take care.

664
00:40:07.534 --> 00:40:09.135
I'm Choi Eun Seok.

665
00:40:09.905 --> 00:40:12.135
I came here because Mother called.

666
00:40:12.434 --> 00:40:14.105
I'm Choi Eun Seok.

667
00:40:15.974 --> 00:40:18.675
How dare you deceive No Myung Hee unscathed?

668
00:40:30.085 --> 00:40:31.525
Is it over?

669
00:40:32.624 --> 00:40:33.655
What?

670
00:40:33.655 --> 00:40:35.425
You're finally up here.

671
00:40:35.695 --> 00:40:36.994
Was it fun to watch?

672
00:40:38.394 --> 00:40:41.204
Gosh, you seem shocked.

673
00:40:41.534 --> 00:40:42.565
What?

674
00:40:43.264 --> 00:40:44.874
Well... A little.

675
00:40:45.934 --> 00:40:48.874
You just thought Mom is elegant and charismatic.

676
00:40:50.144 --> 00:40:51.945
Should I call it Mom's territory?

677
00:40:52.744 --> 00:40:55.184
Is it her pride? Lie?

678
00:40:55.914 --> 00:40:57.054
Deception.

679
00:40:57.485 --> 00:40:58.954
She never forgives that.

680
00:41:00.585 --> 00:41:02.684
She makes sure to let them pay for it.

681
00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:06.655
Housekeepers, drivers, or private tutors.

682
00:41:07.425 --> 00:41:09.724
If anyone leaks a word about our family,

683
00:41:09.724 --> 00:41:11.635
she'll do anything to make them lose their job.

684
00:41:12.534 --> 00:41:14.534
It's not just us. Everyone's the same.

685
00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:17.374
We have our own hot line.

686
00:41:17.905 --> 00:41:19.304
I see.

687
00:41:19.905 --> 00:41:21.804
We pay them a lot instead.

688
00:41:22.204 --> 00:41:24.115
Their salaries are much higher than normal.

689
00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:25.574
They should be worth it.

690
00:41:28.585 --> 00:41:31.414
There's a girl who spread a rumor about Do Kyung.

691
00:41:33.355 --> 00:41:35.755
Mom made even her father lose his job.

692
00:41:58.974 --> 00:42:00.244
(Soo A, I got the tickets to "Casablanca".)

693
00:42:00.244 --> 00:42:01.315
(I think you should take them.)

694
00:42:04.184 --> 00:42:05.684
She's just not texting me back since we're over.

695
00:42:06.014 --> 00:42:07.014
I'm sure she's fine.

696
00:42:26.374 --> 00:42:27.505
Soo A.

697
00:42:32.675 --> 00:42:33.715
Soo A.

698
00:42:35.144 --> 00:42:37.414
What's wrong? Are you sick?

699
00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:38.755
Where?

700
00:42:40.485 --> 00:42:42.724
Hey, why did you leave home like this?

701
00:42:43.025 --> 00:42:44.394
Can't you call a taxi?

702
00:42:44.394 --> 00:42:45.525
Where's your roommate?

703
00:42:46.054 --> 00:42:48.465
I couldn't get a taxi to come here.

704
00:42:49.894 --> 00:42:50.965
Wait.

705
00:42:51.434 --> 00:42:52.894
I'll take you to a hospital.

706
00:42:57.005 --> 00:42:59.374
Let me just take you to a hospital.

707
00:43:00.005 --> 00:43:01.244
What for?

708
00:43:05.144 --> 00:43:06.914
Because I'm all you have.

709
00:43:07.115 --> 00:43:08.485
I'm all you have.

710
00:43:10.585 --> 00:43:12.255
You know that.

711
00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.224
I'm sorry, Soo A.

712
00:43:19.925 --> 00:43:21.124
To be honest...

713
00:43:23.195 --> 00:43:24.695
I want to live with you.

714
00:43:26.434 --> 00:43:27.664
I want to.

715
00:43:29.304 --> 00:43:30.505
I really mean it.

716
00:43:34.744 --> 00:43:37.144
I love you, Soo A.

717
00:43:43.545 --> 00:43:45.985
Soo A. Soo A.

718
00:43:47.255 --> 00:43:48.324
Soo A.

719
00:43:52.994 --> 00:43:54.594
Nothing else is wrong.

720
00:43:55.025 --> 00:43:56.965
She just has a bad cold and is under much stress.

721
00:43:56.965 --> 00:43:58.664
She became too weak.

722
00:43:58.894 --> 00:44:00.664
She can leave when the drip is done.

723
00:44:02.204 --> 00:44:04.275
Feed her well, and let her rest.

724
00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:06.304
Okay. Thank you.

725
00:44:32.434 --> 00:44:33.635
Ji An.

726
00:44:34.835 --> 00:44:36.434
Why are you here so late?

727
00:44:37.874 --> 00:44:38.905
Mom.

728
00:44:39.704 --> 00:44:41.074
I know everything.

729
00:44:42.144 --> 00:44:45.115
"Everything"? What do you know?

730
00:44:46.115 --> 00:44:48.485
How could you do such a thing?

731
00:44:50.315 --> 00:44:52.315
How could you do that?

732
00:44:53.284 --> 00:44:56.585
How could you swap me and Ji Soo?

733
00:44:57.655 --> 00:44:58.724
Ji An.

734
00:44:59.824 --> 00:45:00.865
Come with me.

735
00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:03.065
Come and beg for forgiveness with me.

736
00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:05.934
Ji An.

737
00:45:10.804 --> 00:45:11.835
Dad.

738
00:45:14.474 --> 00:45:16.644
Why didn't you tell me then?

739
00:45:17.815 --> 00:45:19.715
Why didn't you tell me back then...

740
00:45:19.715 --> 00:45:21.385
that it wasn't me?

741
00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:23.315
It was Ji Soo.

742
00:45:28.885 --> 00:45:30.224
Come with me now.

743
00:45:30.655 --> 00:45:33.925
I can't stay in that house a single day longer.

744
00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:37.135
It's suffocating. My heart beats out of my chest.

745
00:45:37.894 --> 00:45:40.295
I can't use the card my new mom gave me.

746
00:45:40.295 --> 00:45:42.335
I eat and sleep in their house,

747
00:45:42.335 --> 00:45:44.335
wear clothes bought with their money,

748
00:45:44.335 --> 00:45:46.574
and take taxis, and it all drives me crazy.

749
00:45:49.974 --> 00:45:51.574
So come with me,

750
00:45:52.445 --> 00:45:54.945
tell them the truth, and beg for forgiveness.

751
00:46:17.505 --> 00:46:19.005
What is this?

752
00:46:19.074 --> 00:46:21.304
How dare you come here without a call?

753
00:46:22.704 --> 00:46:24.974
It must be so important if they're here so late.

754
00:46:26.014 --> 00:46:27.585
Are you Seo Tae Soo?

755
00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:30.585
What brought you both here?

756
00:46:32.954 --> 00:46:35.824
It's not Ji An.

757
00:46:35.824 --> 00:46:36.855
Ji Soo...

758
00:46:37.554 --> 00:46:39.394
is your daughter.

759
00:46:44.335 --> 00:46:45.594
What do you mean?

760
00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:47.105
What did you just say?

761
00:46:49.005 --> 00:46:51.934
Ji An is my daughter.

762
00:46:51.934 --> 00:46:53.005
Ji Soo...

763
00:46:53.434 --> 00:46:55.775
Ji Soo is your daughter.

764
00:46:57.874 --> 00:46:59.045
Say that again.

765
00:46:59.545 --> 00:47:02.514
Who... Ji An is your daughter?

766
00:47:02.644 --> 00:47:03.885
What nonsense...

767
00:47:04.554 --> 00:47:06.885
What nonsense are you talking about?

768
00:47:06.885 --> 00:47:09.155
Are you saying that you sent us your daughter?

769
00:47:14.525 --> 00:47:16.164
I deserve to die for this.

770
00:47:16.965 --> 00:47:20.094
It was me. I did it. He had no idea.

771
00:47:20.094 --> 00:47:21.405
Shut your mouth.

772
00:47:23.105 --> 00:47:25.204
You have no right to make any excuses.

773
00:47:30.615 --> 00:47:31.615
Ms. Min.

774
00:47:32.144 --> 00:47:35.644
Did you check up on their other kids?

775
00:47:40.014 --> 00:47:41.255
(Resignation)

776
00:47:41.255 --> 00:47:42.485
I'm really sorry.

777
00:48:05.815 --> 00:48:06.844
Mom.

778
00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:08.885
Dad. Dad.

779
00:48:10.244 --> 00:48:13.514
Ms. Min, my mom and dad...

780
00:48:13.514 --> 00:48:15.755
Were they here like this all night long?

781
00:48:16.784 --> 00:48:19.425
How dare you come back here?

782
00:48:19.554 --> 00:48:21.594
I came to apologize too.

783
00:48:22.195 --> 00:48:25.195
But... But could you please...

784
00:48:25.195 --> 00:48:26.764
let my mom and dad leave?

785
00:48:26.764 --> 00:48:28.235
They were here all night like this.

786
00:48:28.235 --> 00:48:29.264
My parents...

787
00:48:29.264 --> 00:48:30.835
You dare call us your parents?

788
00:48:31.374 --> 00:48:32.735
I apologize.

789
00:48:36.244 --> 00:48:38.215
Take these off right now.

790
00:48:41.115 --> 00:48:43.344
Strip her of everything I paid for.

791
00:48:43.344 --> 00:48:46.085
Strip her naked, and throw her out.

792
00:48:46.485 --> 00:48:48.054
Yes, ma'am.

793
00:50:37.565 --> 00:50:38.865
Dad.

794
00:50:42.235 --> 00:50:44.175
What should we do now?

795
00:50:48.175 --> 00:50:49.675
Back then...

796
00:50:51.545 --> 00:50:54.014
I'm so sorry for saying all those awful things.

797
00:50:57.115 --> 00:50:59.585
But you should've still told me then.

798
00:51:02.454 --> 00:51:03.454
No.

799
00:51:04.724 --> 00:51:07.164
How could he after everything I said?

800
00:51:09.724 --> 00:51:11.135
But he still should have.

801
00:51:12.894 --> 00:51:14.465
He should have told me that it wasn't me.

802
00:51:33.115 --> 00:51:36.025
(40th anniversary event)

803
00:51:51.534 --> 00:51:52.775
23rd,

804
00:51:53.275 --> 00:51:55.644
24th, 28th.

805
00:51:55.945 --> 00:51:57.175
Yoon Ha Jung.

806
00:51:57.974 --> 00:51:59.215
23rd.

807
00:52:01.784 --> 00:52:03.115
Finish preparations.

808
00:52:09.355 --> 00:52:10.755
Did you ask for me, sir?

809
00:52:11.624 --> 00:52:13.494
I like the new proposal.

810
00:52:14.094 --> 00:52:16.565
PR, marketing, and the 40th anniversary...

811
00:52:16.764 --> 00:52:18.235
all in one package.

812
00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:20.764
I see why you decided to pull up the schedule,

813
00:52:21.135 --> 00:52:24.204
and I like the idea of hosting a contest...

814
00:52:24.434 --> 00:52:27.644
to select one as our Design Team's prints.

815
00:52:28.644 --> 00:52:30.374
It was Seo Ji An's idea.

816
00:52:31.675 --> 00:52:33.615
There's not much time left.

817
00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:36.744
- Can she do it in time? - Don't worry.

818
00:52:37.115 --> 00:52:39.054
Ms. Seo already did a lot of the research...

819
00:52:39.054 --> 00:52:40.824
while writing the proposal.

820
00:52:42.284 --> 00:52:45.255
We'll mention this event in our PR video.

821
00:52:46.054 --> 00:52:47.465
In our corporation's promotion video?

822
00:52:47.695 --> 00:52:49.094
The chairman's orders.

823
00:52:49.764 --> 00:52:50.965
I see.

824
00:52:53.635 --> 00:52:55.434
Call me when you finish making our flyers...

825
00:52:55.434 --> 00:52:57.905
as mentioned in the detailed proposal.

826
00:53:00.304 --> 00:53:03.304
Are you done separating our files from FNB's?

827
00:53:03.474 --> 00:53:05.445
You can label them before lunch.

828
00:53:05.844 --> 00:53:08.144
Before lunch? No way.

829
00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.954
I have to check the names of our winter releases...

830
00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:11.985
and make a report about them.

831
00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:18.155
Hello, everyone.

832
00:53:27.135 --> 00:53:28.704
Do you know we're shooting...

833
00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:31.005
a PR video for Haesung FNB and...

834
00:53:31.335 --> 00:53:33.675
MJ Hotel's expansion into Europe?

835
00:53:34.974 --> 00:53:36.105
We've decided to include...

836
00:53:36.605 --> 00:53:39.574
the 40th anniversary event in that clip.

837
00:53:41.315 --> 00:53:44.755
But Haesung Apparel has no plans to enter Europe.

838
00:53:44.855 --> 00:53:46.215
The chairman's orders.

839
00:53:48.655 --> 00:53:52.094
It's because the event includes many programs...

840
00:53:52.525 --> 00:53:55.925
that foreigners would show interest in.

841
00:53:57.465 --> 00:53:58.764
Thanks to Ms. Seo.

842
00:54:03.005 --> 00:54:06.574
Then we must make sure everything looks good.

843
00:54:06.934 --> 00:54:09.675
Correct. The 40th anniversary event...

844
00:54:09.844 --> 00:54:11.715
is meaningful since Haesung Corporation...

845
00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:14.014
began from Haesung Apparel.

846
00:54:14.644 --> 00:54:16.414
It's also important because...

847
00:54:16.585 --> 00:54:19.385
it'll boost our sales which is in a plateau.

848
00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:22.985
This is the first big-scale event...

849
00:54:23.124 --> 00:54:25.755
for both me and you all.

850
00:54:27.224 --> 00:54:28.465
We'll do our best.

851
00:54:29.025 --> 00:54:31.934
That means nothing. You must do well.

852
00:54:34.005 --> 00:54:36.605
We can't ruin our PR video.

853
00:54:37.105 --> 00:54:39.905
This would greatly affect your performance ratings.

854
00:54:39.974 --> 00:54:41.175
Seriously?

855
00:54:43.275 --> 00:54:46.244
Ms. Seo will be under a lot of pressure.

856
00:54:46.744 --> 00:54:48.485
I hope you'll all help her out.

857
00:54:49.644 --> 00:54:51.985
Ms. Seo, I hope you can manage.

858
00:54:56.155 --> 00:54:58.255
You all heard what he said.

859
00:54:58.454 --> 00:55:01.164
Let's give Ms. Seo a round of applause.

860
00:55:07.664 --> 00:55:08.764
Thank you.

861
00:55:09.505 --> 00:55:11.204
Ms. Seo, come to my office.

862
00:55:11.534 --> 00:55:13.034
Come now with the proposal.

863
00:55:31.324 --> 00:55:32.824
Did you ask to see me?

864
00:55:33.554 --> 00:55:35.994
Speak freely. My office isn't bugged.

865
00:55:36.525 --> 00:55:39.865
No, sir. I don't want to mess up at work.

866
00:55:40.505 --> 00:55:41.735
Not bad.

867
00:55:42.835 --> 00:55:43.874
Have a seat.

868
00:55:48.974 --> 00:55:51.175
Seo Hyun said you seemed scared by seeing...

869
00:55:51.175 --> 00:55:52.215
what happened to Ms. Jin.

870
00:55:54.585 --> 00:55:55.644
Yes.

871
00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:57.414
It wasn't just because...

872
00:55:57.454 --> 00:55:59.914
Ms. Jin told others about you.

873
00:56:00.954 --> 00:56:03.925
The Head of State Affairs will be my father-in-law.

874
00:56:04.525 --> 00:56:06.094
And Seo Hyun will marry the New World Group.

875
00:56:08.224 --> 00:56:09.324
Right.

876
00:56:10.094 --> 00:56:12.365
I hadn't heard that you were engaged.

877
00:56:12.465 --> 00:56:13.735
I'm not engaged yet.

878
00:56:14.835 --> 00:56:16.465
I'll meet So Ra when...

879
00:56:17.105 --> 00:56:18.505
she returns this winter,

880
00:56:19.304 --> 00:56:21.244
and we'll be engaged about three months later.

881
00:56:22.074 --> 00:56:24.945
And I'll get married sometime next autumn.

882
00:56:26.914 --> 00:56:28.885
Seo Hyun said she was betrothed.

883
00:56:30.655 --> 00:56:32.715
I guess you are too.

884
00:56:32.885 --> 00:56:33.954
Our marriage...

885
00:56:33.954 --> 00:56:36.425
plays a big part in strengthening our company.

886
00:56:36.855 --> 00:56:38.655
That's why it had to be.

887
00:56:39.394 --> 00:56:41.724
If your cover's blown before you're ready,

888
00:56:42.124 --> 00:56:44.434
our arranged marriages could have fallen through.

889
00:56:45.365 --> 00:56:48.764
We don't get into losing deals.

890
00:56:49.264 --> 00:56:50.635
Marriage...

891
00:56:51.534 --> 00:56:52.804
is a deal?

892
00:56:52.974 --> 00:56:54.775
They look people up...

893
00:56:54.905 --> 00:56:56.974
to make sure they're eligible.

894
00:56:56.974 --> 00:56:58.344
It's not just any deal.

895
00:56:59.574 --> 00:57:01.784
Over 10 years, Ms. Jin...

896
00:57:02.184 --> 00:57:05.615
got regular support and large donations.

897
00:57:06.284 --> 00:57:09.054
So Mom couldn't forgive Ms. Jin for what she did.

898
00:57:11.054 --> 00:57:12.425
I see.

899
00:57:13.195 --> 00:57:15.925
You were already stressed by planning a huge event.

900
00:57:16.295 --> 00:57:18.894
Was seeing Mom angry put more pressure on you?

901
00:57:19.795 --> 00:57:22.365
Still, did you have to leave so early for work?

902
00:57:22.835 --> 00:57:24.704
I had so much to do.

903
00:57:25.605 --> 00:57:28.844
If that's all, I'd like to leave.

904
00:57:30.715 --> 00:57:32.815
Hang in there until the anniversary.

905
00:57:45.925 --> 00:57:46.925
We've decided to include...

906
00:57:46.925 --> 00:57:49.664
the 40th anniversary event in that clip.

907
00:57:50.365 --> 00:57:51.534
The chairman's orders.

908
00:57:52.735 --> 00:57:54.664
It's also important because...

909
00:57:55.005 --> 00:57:58.775
it'll boost our sales which is in a plateau.

910
00:57:59.374 --> 00:58:01.144
Ms. Seo will be under a lot of pressure.

911
00:58:01.445 --> 00:58:03.744
Ms. Seo, I hope you can manage.

912
00:58:05.144 --> 00:58:06.244
Why is everything...

913
00:58:07.744 --> 00:58:09.485
getting so muddled up?

914
00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:15.985
What should I do?

915
00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:31.874
(Exported technology and products)

916
00:58:44.284 --> 00:58:46.184
Can we talk for a moment?

917
00:58:51.525 --> 00:58:54.124
I think I'll tell the kids...

918
00:58:55.094 --> 00:58:57.135
that I got a job.

919
00:58:58.965 --> 00:59:00.034
A job?

920
00:59:00.635 --> 00:59:02.204
You know, the restaurant.

921
00:59:03.264 --> 00:59:06.905
It's the same thing. I earn money.

922
00:59:08.644 --> 00:59:09.905
Why say that?

923
00:59:10.474 --> 00:59:12.215
Don't do it if you're ashamed.

924
00:59:14.144 --> 00:59:16.085
Must you put it like that?

925
00:59:16.985 --> 00:59:19.115
Why do you think I accepted the offer?

926
00:59:24.624 --> 00:59:25.695
I told you...

927
00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:29.295
I was going to start a business again.

928
00:59:30.664 --> 00:59:32.865
It takes more than just words.

929
00:59:33.494 --> 00:59:35.065
How can I believe you?

930
00:59:35.664 --> 00:59:37.304
It's just a pipe dream.

931
00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:39.275
Then why didn't you stop me...

932
00:59:39.275 --> 00:59:41.605
after I was fired during the financial crisis?

933
00:59:41.974 --> 00:59:43.715
You were young back then.

934
00:59:44.974 --> 00:59:47.014
You're old, and you've lost your touch.

935
00:59:47.644 --> 00:59:49.445
You can't start a business now.

936
00:59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.255
I'm doing this to get Ji An back.

937
01:00:00.795 --> 01:00:03.735
I'll do whatever it takes to succeed.

938
01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.465
To get Ji An back...

939
01:00:06.465 --> 01:00:09.105
and send Ji Soo back to her parents.

940
01:00:10.534 --> 01:00:12.505
Do you think they'll let us be?

941
01:00:12.804 --> 01:00:15.045
I want to go over there right now...

942
01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.545
and beg for forgiveness.

943
01:00:16.675 --> 01:00:19.815
I'd give my life to get Ji An back now.

944
01:00:22.315 --> 01:00:23.344
Look.

945
01:00:24.115 --> 01:00:27.485
If Ji An were to find out while we're in this mess,

946
01:00:28.855 --> 01:00:30.425
how ashamed...

947
01:00:30.525 --> 01:00:33.025
and distraught do you think she'd be?

948
01:00:34.025 --> 01:00:35.865
That's why I won't go over there yet.

949
01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:40.465
Now you know.

950
01:00:41.835 --> 01:00:44.775
If you're the wife I wed over 30 years ago,

951
01:00:45.574 --> 01:00:47.144
don't think of opening the restaurant.

952
01:00:47.874 --> 01:00:49.545
You'll regret it later.

953
01:00:53.144 --> 01:00:54.385
I can't...

954
01:00:55.545 --> 01:00:56.844
trust you anymore.

955
01:00:58.184 --> 01:01:00.184
If your business succeeds,

956
01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.155
I'll quit then.

957
01:01:19.735 --> 01:01:22.045
Before lunch? No way.

958
01:01:22.275 --> 01:01:24.874
I have to check the names of our winter releases...

959
01:01:24.874 --> 01:01:26.014
and make a report about them.

960
01:01:50.905 --> 01:01:52.175
Why were you so surprised?

961
01:01:53.005 --> 01:01:54.844
It's like you did something wrong.

962
01:01:55.105 --> 01:01:58.914
It was all so sudden. Why are you here?

963
01:02:03.115 --> 01:02:04.684
Get in before you get noticed.

964
01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.445
I...

965
01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:32.675
Can you please stay quiet?

966
01:02:33.344 --> 01:02:34.414
What?

967
01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:35.815
Please stay quiet.

968
01:02:36.514 --> 01:02:37.954
I have a lot to think about.

969
01:02:55.978 --> 01:03:00.978
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

970
01:03:29.534 --> 01:03:31.034
I'm home.

971
01:03:31.204 --> 01:03:32.405
Sit down.

972
01:03:43.644 --> 01:03:46.385
I had to talk to you, so I had Do Kyung to bring you.

973
01:03:46.914 --> 01:03:49.184
You kept running away here and there.

974
01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:51.624
We could never see you at home.

975
01:03:55.394 --> 01:03:58.835
Listen to what we say now,

976
01:03:59.565 --> 01:04:01.534
and answer honestly.

977
01:04:04.434 --> 01:04:05.534
Yes.

978
01:04:07.175 --> 01:04:08.445
What do you think...

979
01:04:09.105 --> 01:04:10.675
about studying abroad?

980
01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:12.914
Pardon?

981
01:04:15.045 --> 01:04:16.885
Did the work stress you out?

982
01:04:16.885 --> 01:04:18.655
Didn't you hear us?

983
01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:19.815
Study abroad.

984
01:04:20.284 --> 01:04:22.324
Mother and Father will send you...

985
01:04:22.324 --> 01:04:24.094
to the United States to study art.

986
01:04:29.195 --> 01:04:31.164
I noticed last time in the gallery.

987
01:04:31.894 --> 01:04:33.065
I think...

988
01:04:33.065 --> 01:04:35.934
you should study art before it gets too late.

989
01:04:36.304 --> 01:04:37.704
What do you say?

990
01:04:40.474 --> 01:04:42.704
We haven't discussed it with the chairman yet,

991
01:04:43.374 --> 01:04:45.615
but it'd be better to reveal you...

992
01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:48.085
to the public after you come back from study.

993
01:04:49.744 --> 01:04:51.414
You should leave as Seo Ji An...

994
01:04:51.414 --> 01:04:53.255
if you go study abroad.

995
01:04:53.755 --> 01:04:55.655
Why are you so quiet?

996
01:04:55.954 --> 01:04:57.295
Don't you want to go?

997
01:04:57.724 --> 01:04:59.155
Do you like working at the company more?

998
01:04:59.755 --> 01:05:00.795
I...

999
01:05:01.894 --> 01:05:03.065
I'm...

1000
01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.164
Seo Ji An.

1001
01:05:06.534 --> 01:05:07.534
No.

1002
01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:09.365
Choi Eun Seok.

1003
01:05:11.335 --> 01:05:12.335
Eun Seok.

1004
01:05:13.105 --> 01:05:14.175
Go study abroad.

1005
01:05:15.175 --> 01:05:17.474
You couldn't do it because you lived in that house.

1006
01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:02.324
(My Golden Life)

1007
01:06:04.824 --> 01:06:07.195
Will you have breakfast with me?

1008
01:06:07.195 --> 01:06:08.594
I'm starving.

1009
01:06:08.894 --> 01:06:10.295
Mr. Baker.

1010
01:06:10.295 --> 01:06:12.764
He looks so different all dressed up.

1011
01:06:13.565 --> 01:06:14.804
Oh, hello.

1012
01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:15.835
Do you remember me?

1013
01:06:15.835 --> 01:06:16.934
What are you doing here?

1014
01:06:16.934 --> 01:06:19.675
- I'm Ji An's brother. - What?

1015
01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:20.675
Now that you're a regular employee...

1016
01:06:20.675 --> 01:06:22.105
and the vice president loves you,

1017
01:06:22.105 --> 01:06:23.715
you're devoting your life.

1018
01:06:23.715 --> 01:06:25.615
Sir, you should see what's on the bulletin board.

1019
01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:26.974
The bulletin board?

1020
01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:29.514
Who did this?

1021
01:06:29.514 --> 01:06:30.985
Call the board of directors now.

1022
01:06:30.985 --> 01:06:32.215
We're revealing Eun Seok today.

1023
01:06:32.215 --> 01:06:34.525
We're revealing you today, Eun Seok.

1024
01:06:34.885 --> 01:06:36.355
Hello.

1025
01:06:36.624 --> 01:06:38.425
My name is Seo Ji An.
