(Episode 12)

2
00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:57.286
What happened? Where did they go?

3
00:00:57.716 --> 00:00:58.886
Where did they go?

4
00:00:59.757 --> 00:01:01.257
- Did you see it? - Yes.

5
00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:02.786
I also saw it.

6
00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:37.087
We need to go back.

7
00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:39.227
We need...

8
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.436
Are you crazy?

9
00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:53.507
If you want to die, do it alone.

10
00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:13.156
What should we do with this girl?

11
00:02:13.797 --> 00:02:14.927
Leave her like that.

12
00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:17.327
She will die if we leave her like that.

13
00:02:17.496 --> 00:02:18.797
Let us go. Hurry.

14
00:02:31.476 --> 00:02:33.117
Are you okay?

15
00:02:55.737 --> 00:02:56.867
What happened?

16
00:02:56.867 --> 00:02:59.607
He ran into the road. I think he was committing suicide.

17
00:03:11.756 --> 00:03:13.017
Sir.

18
00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:15.457
Are you feeling all right?

19
00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:19.496
Sir, please calm down.

20
00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:21.696
- Give me your knife. - Calm down.

21
00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:22.996
Give me your knife.

22
00:03:25.036 --> 00:03:26.267
What are you doing? Get him!

23
00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:30.167
Give me your knife. Let me go.

24
00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:33.337
Let me go. Please let me go.

25
00:03:34.107 --> 00:03:36.246
- I need to go back. - Calm down.

26
00:03:44.587 --> 00:03:45.786
Stop.

27
00:03:50.587 --> 00:03:51.857
Who are you?

28
00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:54.196
A doctor is waiting for her. I need to take her.

29
00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:57.226
I am the doctor. I will treat her.

30
00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:34.396
Were you the man on the phone?

31
00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:35.636
Yes.

32
00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:38.307
He woke up right after he was brought here,

33
00:04:38.307 --> 00:04:42.246
but he made a big fuss saying he needed to die. We sedated him.

34
00:04:42.576 --> 00:04:44.917
Was he alone when you found him?

35
00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.547
Was he with someone? Was there a woman with him?

36
00:04:47.547 --> 00:04:49.446
No, I heard he was alone.

37
00:04:49.787 --> 00:04:52.516
By the way, his guardian is going to come here.

38
00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:53.756
His guardian?

39
00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:56.256
Yes, I answered a call from his phone,

40
00:04:56.527 --> 00:04:58.927
and it was from someone called "Director".

41
00:05:00.826 --> 00:05:02.027
My grandfather.

42
00:05:03.027 --> 00:05:04.167
I'll leave you to it.

43
00:05:15.907 --> 00:05:18.006
Hey, hey.

44
00:05:19.316 --> 00:05:22.686
Where is Yeon Kyung? Where is she? Why are you here by yourself?

45
00:05:33.427 --> 00:05:35.597
- She is in danger. - What?

46
00:05:36.527 --> 00:05:37.696
What do you mean?

47
00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:40.537
Why is she in danger?

48
00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:43.037
Can you... Can you untie me?

49
00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:45.277
I need to go back.

50
00:05:45.376 --> 00:05:48.477
Where is she? I'll go there. I'll go.

51
00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:53.217
Please, please let me go.

52
00:05:54.347 --> 00:05:55.847
She is in danger.

53
00:06:00.417 --> 00:06:01.557
Please.

54
00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:05.326
I need to go back.

55
00:06:09.566 --> 00:06:10.667
Please.

56
00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:14.136
Tell me everything when you come back.

57
00:06:14.737 --> 00:06:16.037
You need to bring her back.

58
00:06:25.177 --> 00:06:26.516
Where are my needles?

59
00:06:41.626 --> 00:06:42.667
Please.

60
00:06:43.696 --> 00:06:45.667
Please take me back there.

61
00:07:24.807 --> 00:07:26.006
What...

62
00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:31.946
What is this? Where is he?

63
00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:26.467
Yeon Kyung.

64
00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:33.537
Did anyone see Yeon Kyung?

65
00:08:34.907 --> 00:08:36.807
Did no one see her?

66
00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:39.417
Excuse me! Yeon Kyung!

67
00:08:39.677 --> 00:08:42.417
I need to call the police station. This cannot be happening.

68
00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:22.226
Who are you?

69
00:09:26.326 --> 00:09:27.557
Where am I?

70
00:09:27.557 --> 00:09:30.497
I saw you before.

71
00:09:41.436 --> 00:09:42.706
It's you.

72
00:09:44.846 --> 00:09:46.316
What's your name?

73
00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:48.787
- I am Yeon Yi. - Yeon Yi.

74
00:09:50.917 --> 00:09:52.186
It's a pretty name.

75
00:09:55.287 --> 00:09:57.486
Yeon Kyung! Yeon Kyung!

76
00:09:57.486 --> 00:09:58.696
Where are you, Yeon Kyung?

77
00:10:07.297 --> 00:10:09.936
- Who are you? - You need to follow me.

78
00:10:16.147 --> 00:10:17.706
How are you feeling?

79
00:10:21.686 --> 00:10:24.086
- Yes. - Fortunately, we stopped...

80
00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:26.017
the bleeding and you did not lose too much blood.

81
00:10:29.057 --> 00:10:33.657
This is Angelica sinensis. It will help with Qi and extravasated blood.

82
00:10:46.177 --> 00:10:47.576
It was you.

83
00:10:49.047 --> 00:10:50.807
20 year ago,

84
00:10:52.147 --> 00:10:55.116
you came to my world...

85
00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:56.946
like he did.

86
00:10:58.356 --> 00:10:59.616
You came to me.

87
00:11:00.956 --> 00:11:02.657
Do you remember me?

88
00:11:06.657 --> 00:11:08.057
20 years ago,

89
00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:11.096
I was so full of myself after becoming a doctor...

90
00:11:11.297 --> 00:11:13.866
that I failed to save a girl that I could have saved.

91
00:11:14.137 --> 00:11:17.466
I blamed myself saying I did not deserve to be a doctor,

92
00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:20.606
and I tried to slit my wrist.

93
00:11:25.716 --> 00:11:28.076
At that moment, I was transferred to a strange world.

94
00:11:28.647 --> 00:11:30.686
Even before I could find out where I was,

95
00:11:31.446 --> 00:11:34.586
I heard a devastating cry of a child.

96
00:11:34.616 --> 00:11:36.427
Dad.

97
00:11:37.586 --> 00:11:39.527
Dad.

98
00:11:43.667 --> 00:11:46.866
Dad. Dad.

99
00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:49.066
Dad.

100
00:11:53.777 --> 00:11:55.647
I could see at that moment...

101
00:11:56.206 --> 00:12:00.377
how her long life would be scarred by that incident.

102
00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.927
Child, it is all right.

103
00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:15.866
The child's eyes seemed to be asking for help.

104
00:12:17.297 --> 00:12:20.866
They were just like the eyes that the girl I could not save had.

105
00:12:26.476 --> 00:12:28.377
Even when you were young,

106
00:12:28.877 --> 00:12:31.716
you were blaming yourself for letting your father die.

107
00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:40.887
I really had to save you.

108
00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.576
However, I only treated half of you.

109
00:13:03.307 --> 00:13:06.116
You woke up, but you didn't remember what happened.

110
00:13:12.456 --> 00:13:15.057
They call this Sadangwon in Joseon.

111
00:13:17.127 --> 00:13:19.856
I am giving you this so that you will not cry, Yeon Kyung.

112
00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:28.267
You erased your memory on your own,

113
00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:30.037
but I thought it was better for you.

114
00:13:30.336 --> 00:13:32.877
Someday you would be old enough to be able to deal with that memory.

115
00:13:33.576 --> 00:13:36.346
You could meet someone who can help you heal that wound.

116
00:13:36.647 --> 00:13:38.976
Then that memory would come back to you.

117
00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:42.586
I could not finish treating you,

118
00:13:42.586 --> 00:13:44.047
but that person could finish it, I thought.

119
00:13:47.086 --> 00:13:48.726
By saving your life at that time,

120
00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.696
I could find my way to be a doctor.

121
00:13:54.726 --> 00:13:57.627
Have you met that someone yet?

122
00:14:01.096 --> 00:14:02.106
Yes,

123
00:14:04.307 --> 00:14:05.576
I have...

124
00:14:07.106 --> 00:14:08.206
met him.

125
00:14:15.116 --> 00:14:17.047
Where is she? In which room?

126
00:14:17.287 --> 00:14:18.287
She is in there.

127
00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:21.887
Yeon Kyung, Yeon Kyung!

128
00:14:29.897 --> 00:14:31.066
Are you okay?

129
00:14:32.897 --> 00:14:34.196
Are you sure you are okay?

130
00:14:38.307 --> 00:14:41.307
I am sorry. I am truly sorry.

131
00:14:43.446 --> 00:14:45.877
Thank you so much for staying alive.

132
00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:52.486
Are you really okay?

133
00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:01.127
It must have hurt a lot.

134
00:15:15.576 --> 00:15:17.047
I will not...

135
00:15:17.677 --> 00:15:20.517
I will not leave you alone. Not again.

136
00:15:24.517 --> 00:15:26.057
I will never do that.

137
00:15:27.517 --> 00:15:28.856
I am truly sorry.

138
00:15:35.297 --> 00:15:37.866
I really appreciate that you are alive.

139
00:15:47.677 --> 00:15:50.446
I heard that you are following the king.

140
00:15:50.877 --> 00:15:51.946
I hope...

141
00:15:53.047 --> 00:15:54.747
I can see you again.

142
00:16:05.826 --> 00:16:07.397
We should get going.

143
00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.566
Please take care of Mak Gae.

144
00:16:38.326 --> 00:16:40.527
After Dr. Heo leaves here this time,

145
00:16:40.897 --> 00:16:42.866
when is he coming back again?

146
00:16:43.966 --> 00:16:45.936
Is he ever going to come back?

147
00:16:48.936 --> 00:16:51.777
Thank you for soothing Yeon Kyung's heart.

148
00:16:52.076 --> 00:16:54.736
I appreciate that you treated Yeon Kyung, but...

149
00:16:55.946 --> 00:16:59.547
It did not end my old grudge against you, Master Heo.

150
00:16:59.716 --> 00:17:03.346
Yes. We still have matters to resolve between us.

151
00:17:05.616 --> 00:17:07.356
That is all in the past.

152
00:17:08.586 --> 00:17:11.697
I will not take the memory of this world with me when I leave.

153
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:14.227
If that is the only burden for the path you are going now...

154
00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:16.166
Yes.

155
00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:18.767
To erase the memory could be a solution...

156
00:17:19.596 --> 00:17:21.497
if only you are able to do that.

157
00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.836
If you think I will come back according to my own will,

158
00:17:26.507 --> 00:17:28.277
you should stop thinking that way.

159
00:17:28.307 --> 00:17:31.307
As it has been all along, everything is up to your choice.

160
00:17:31.376 --> 00:17:34.646
I am just fulfilling my duty which is given to me.

161
00:17:44.386 --> 00:17:45.997
I will wait for him.

162
00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:49.896
I will be waiting for him.

163
00:17:55.366 --> 00:17:58.106
Why did you not tell him about Yeon Yi?

164
00:17:59.176 --> 00:18:01.747
He would have been glad to find out that she is alive.

165
00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:03.507
He would have been glad.

166
00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:07.316
However, now is not the time.

167
00:18:08.116 --> 00:18:11.416
Now, she is holding out due to the medicine you are giving,

168
00:18:12.557 --> 00:18:15.656
but what if something happens to Yeon Yi...

169
00:18:15.656 --> 00:18:17.626
It is not because of the medicine I am giving her.

170
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.396
Yeon Yi is also waiting.

171
00:18:31.807 --> 00:18:33.277
Her waiting heart is...

172
00:18:33.477 --> 00:18:36.277
helping her holding out like that.

173
00:18:44.047 --> 00:18:47.356
(Shinhae Hospital)

174
00:18:47.356 --> 00:18:49.757
(Emergency Medical Center)

175
00:18:49.757 --> 00:18:51.727
An emergency patient is here!

176
00:18:51.727 --> 00:18:53.826
Please help! Anyone here?

177
00:18:54.057 --> 00:18:56.596
We could go to another hospital. Why did you have to come here?

178
00:18:56.596 --> 00:18:58.197
That is not important now.

179
00:18:58.197 --> 00:18:59.937
Excuse me! An emergency patient is here.

180
00:18:59.937 --> 00:19:03.166
Please help...Please help now!

181
00:19:06.076 --> 00:19:07.076
Help...

182
00:19:11.376 --> 00:19:12.376
Here...

183
00:19:12.576 --> 00:19:15.217
An emergency patient is here. Please give help now.

184
00:19:15.217 --> 00:19:16.346
There is no time to lose!

185
00:19:17.846 --> 00:19:19.757
She has been struck by a sword. Please look at her.

186
00:19:20.156 --> 00:19:21.156
Wait a minute, please!

187
00:19:21.156 --> 00:19:22.326
Yes, okay.

188
00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:25.926
There is no time to lose! Hurry...

189
00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:31.326
Who are you?

190
00:19:32.666 --> 00:19:34.237
I am her guardian.

191
00:19:34.906 --> 00:19:37.406
Are you Dr. Choi's boyfriend, by any chance?

192
00:19:37.406 --> 00:19:39.376
No! I'm not...

193
00:19:42.207 --> 00:19:43.307
yet.

194
00:19:48.346 --> 00:19:50.886
What... What is this?

195
00:19:50.886 --> 00:19:52.457
It looks like someone put...

196
00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:54.717
liquidambar formosana and old pine tree bark powder on her back.

197
00:19:54.926 --> 00:19:56.086
Those are effective...

198
00:19:56.086 --> 00:19:58.727
in stopping bleeding, disinfection, and healing the wound.

199
00:20:00.257 --> 00:20:01.497
He did a good job.

200
00:20:04.666 --> 00:20:06.437
Can you please sew it up a bit more gently?

201
00:20:06.467 --> 00:20:07.866
Please do it gently so that it would not hurt her.

202
00:20:08.197 --> 00:20:10.066
I did give her an anesthetic.

203
00:20:10.566 --> 00:20:11.906
I see.

204
00:20:12.207 --> 00:20:14.477
Still, it might hurt. More gently, please!

205
00:20:14.477 --> 00:20:15.507
You know...

206
00:20:15.676 --> 00:20:17.376
Go ahead.

207
00:20:17.507 --> 00:20:19.576
Can you please stay out for a while?

208
00:20:19.576 --> 00:20:20.646
That's what I'm saying.

209
00:20:21.047 --> 00:20:22.116
Can you stay outside?

210
00:20:22.116 --> 00:20:23.947
How can a guardian stay outside?

211
00:20:24.187 --> 00:20:25.787
I will keep quiet.

212
00:20:25.916 --> 00:20:29.356
Please do it gently so that it will not hurt her. Goodness.

213
00:20:30.586 --> 00:20:32.227
What is going on there?

214
00:20:32.797 --> 00:20:34.626
It is really odd.

215
00:20:34.626 --> 00:20:36.596
What's that couple outfit?

216
00:20:37.126 --> 00:20:38.336
Have they been shooting a historical drama somewhere?

217
00:20:38.336 --> 00:20:39.666
Where did she get that scar from a sword?

218
00:20:39.666 --> 00:20:41.037
Don't we have to report to the police?

219
00:20:41.037 --> 00:20:43.207
I think it'll be better if we stop caring.

220
00:20:43.406 --> 00:20:45.106
- I agree. - She's right.

221
00:21:08.596 --> 00:21:10.027
It was exactly this pulse.

222
00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.866
It seems that this pulse led me to you.

223
00:21:16.807 --> 00:21:19.576
I knew it the moment I felt your pulse.

224
00:21:20.576 --> 00:21:21.606
You are the woman...

225
00:21:22.346 --> 00:21:24.606
who has the same pulse like mine.

226
00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.386
Just like I have a shadow of my mother,

227
00:21:30.217 --> 00:21:32.356
you must have a scar from your father's death.

228
00:21:34.257 --> 00:21:36.626
That's how it began.

229
00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:41.027
We have a similar wound.

230
00:21:41.027 --> 00:21:43.767
We, who have a similar wound, grew up...

231
00:21:44.727 --> 00:21:46.997
that you became a doctor as you are now,

232
00:21:48.066 --> 00:21:50.237
and I became a doctor as I am now.

233
00:21:53.376 --> 00:21:54.576
No.

234
00:21:56.906 --> 00:21:58.576
We're just doctors.

235
00:22:00.846 --> 00:22:02.947
We treat and save people.

236
00:22:05.187 --> 00:22:07.386
We are on the same path. That's what we are, doctors.

237
00:22:17.366 --> 00:22:18.697
Master Choi.

238
00:22:18.697 --> 00:22:21.267
You punk!

239
00:22:21.267 --> 00:22:24.336
If you told me not to worry, you should not make me worry!

240
00:22:24.336 --> 00:22:26.106
What's this? Tell me what's going on!

241
00:22:26.106 --> 00:22:27.636
Please calm down.

242
00:22:27.636 --> 00:22:30.346
How can you let this happen to my precious granddaughter?

243
00:22:30.346 --> 00:22:31.406
How can you do this?

244
00:22:33.416 --> 00:22:36.146
I am sorry. I do not know what to say.

245
00:22:36.316 --> 00:22:37.517
My goodness!

246
00:22:41.856 --> 00:22:45.557
Then I will let you two talk.

247
00:22:54.096 --> 00:22:55.406
Are you okay?

248
00:22:55.906 --> 00:22:57.866
Are you sure you're okay?

249
00:23:00.207 --> 00:23:01.336
Grandpa.

250
00:23:03.707 --> 00:23:05.376
You knew it all, didn't you?

251
00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:08.146
- What? - Who he is...

252
00:23:09.987 --> 00:23:11.687
and where he came from.

253
00:23:20.757 --> 00:23:22.227
What is that?

254
00:23:23.197 --> 00:23:25.497
Mr. Heo Jun gave this to me.

255
00:23:25.866 --> 00:23:27.997
What? Heo Jun?

256
00:23:35.406 --> 00:23:36.477
Grandpa.

257
00:23:39.076 --> 00:23:40.176
I'm sorry...

258
00:23:44.616 --> 00:23:46.156
that I was too harsh on you...

259
00:23:47.816 --> 00:23:48.987
that day.

260
00:23:59.366 --> 00:24:01.437
Why did you not tell me?

261
00:24:02.906 --> 00:24:05.636
Would things have changed if I had told you?

262
00:24:07.707 --> 00:24:09.747
Come to think of it, it was strange indeed.

263
00:24:10.707 --> 00:24:13.176
You took me in when everyone else thought I was crazy.

264
00:24:14.116 --> 00:24:16.916
You also let me apply acupuncture when I did not have any certificate.

265
00:24:16.916 --> 00:24:21.116
You were dying to apply acupuncture, so I couldn't help it.

266
00:24:23.386 --> 00:24:24.487
How did you...

267
00:24:25.757 --> 00:24:27.326
find it out at first?

268
00:24:29.797 --> 00:24:30.967
That needle container.

269
00:24:32.066 --> 00:24:33.497
There was another person...

270
00:24:34.297 --> 00:24:37.106
who came to me carrying that container 20 years ago.

271
00:24:37.366 --> 00:24:38.477
20 years ago...

272
00:24:41.406 --> 00:24:43.277
Master Heo Jun...

273
00:24:44.007 --> 00:24:46.247
came here with that container too?

274
00:24:46.247 --> 00:24:48.816
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to travel time.

275
00:24:48.816 --> 00:24:53.086
Master, what on earth is this container?

276
00:24:53.156 --> 00:24:54.856
What is this...

277
00:24:56.126 --> 00:24:58.656
- that it came to me? - Why do you ask me?

278
00:24:59.257 --> 00:25:01.257
It's something that you need to figure out yourself.

279
00:25:06.697 --> 00:25:09.366
There are things...

280
00:25:10.106 --> 00:25:14.437
that can't be explained through human's knowledge in this world.

281
00:25:15.307 --> 00:25:18.616
Unreasonable incidents do happen.

282
00:25:19.116 --> 00:25:22.386
You come to realize it as you watch it for a long time.

283
00:25:22.987 --> 00:25:25.386
When something crazy happens out of nowhere,

284
00:25:25.386 --> 00:25:28.057
it's not a coincidence.

285
00:25:28.557 --> 00:25:31.156
There's an inevitable reason...

286
00:25:32.497 --> 00:25:35.096
behind the incident.

287
00:25:38.267 --> 00:25:41.066
It looks like you've reached about half of your way.

288
00:25:41.836 --> 00:25:43.836
You know what your homework is.

289
00:25:43.967 --> 00:25:45.906
Gosh, deal with it yourself.

290
00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:49.146
Don't ever take my granddaughter with you again.

291
00:25:49.547 --> 00:25:51.916
Go by yourself if you have to.

292
00:26:22.146 --> 00:26:23.346
Chun Sool,

293
00:26:23.576 --> 00:26:26.217
how have you been? This is Heo Jun.

294
00:26:27.217 --> 00:26:30.017
I was given such a huge present.

295
00:26:30.687 --> 00:26:34.656
I was glad to see Yeon Kyung as if I was seeing you.

296
00:26:35.356 --> 00:26:38.727
Do you remember what I told you right before I left you?

297
00:26:55.846 --> 00:26:59.316
So you do not need to worry anymore.

298
00:27:00.076 --> 00:27:03.717
She is a strong child, so I am sure she will overcome it.

299
00:27:11.086 --> 00:27:14.356
That's why they happened to meet each other.

300
00:27:16.727 --> 00:27:20.797
It's thankful and fortunate to know.

301
00:27:24.136 --> 00:27:25.437
I hope...

302
00:27:26.537 --> 00:27:30.376
Yeon Kyung puts up with it well when the time comes.

303
00:28:03.676 --> 00:28:05.717
Why were you sleeping in my bed?

304
00:28:06.547 --> 00:28:09.517
You told me to come up last night.

305
00:28:09.646 --> 00:28:10.987
When did I?

306
00:28:11.187 --> 00:28:13.316
Nurse Jung, I didn't.

307
00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:15.287
You asked me to hug you because you were cold.

308
00:28:17.287 --> 00:28:18.797
Nurse Jung.

309
00:28:27.666 --> 00:28:29.437
Here. Have it.

310
00:28:47.257 --> 00:28:49.156
- I'm okay. - Eat it.

311
00:28:53.426 --> 00:28:55.366
I am not sure if it is okay to eat a patient's meal.

312
00:28:56.096 --> 00:28:57.096
Goodness.

313
00:29:03.836 --> 00:29:05.207
Goodness, it hurts.

314
00:29:05.207 --> 00:29:06.836
Your back hurts?

315
00:29:06.836 --> 00:29:08.676
- Nurse! - I mean...

316
00:29:09.947 --> 00:29:12.376
- What's wrong? - Her back...

317
00:29:14.316 --> 00:29:15.316
I'm okay.

318
00:29:15.316 --> 00:29:17.386
- Are you sure? - Yes.

319
00:29:21.487 --> 00:29:23.257
- It hurts again. - Goodness.

320
00:29:23.257 --> 00:29:25.757
- Nurse! She says it hurts again. - What's wrong?

321
00:29:25.826 --> 00:29:28.396
- Please check her back. - Goodness.

322
00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:34.666
- Look. - What?

323
00:29:34.666 --> 00:29:38.406
Don't stick to me like gum, and go do your work.

324
00:29:38.636 --> 00:29:41.676
What is gum? I know what gun is,

325
00:29:41.747 --> 00:29:43.477
but I haven't heard of gum before.

326
00:29:46.146 --> 00:29:47.517
Don't you need to go to work?

327
00:29:47.616 --> 00:29:49.447
You wanted me to quit work before.

328
00:29:49.447 --> 00:29:53.116
And you got injured because of me. I will be with you until you recover.

329
00:29:53.217 --> 00:29:55.626
I cannot stitch up your wound, but I plan to do everything else.

330
00:29:56.326 --> 00:29:58.497
So do not tell me to go away.

331
00:30:01.257 --> 00:30:02.497
Then...

332
00:30:02.596 --> 00:30:04.197
go wash yourself.

333
00:30:04.937 --> 00:30:06.237
Get changed too.

334
00:30:06.997 --> 00:30:08.366
Get some sleep too.

335
00:30:08.767 --> 00:30:11.166
Can I stick to you like gum again...

336
00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:13.636
once I am done with everything you told me to do?

337
00:30:16.176 --> 00:30:18.777
Then I will go wash myself, get changed, and get some sleep.

338
00:30:19.076 --> 00:30:20.477
Wait here.

339
00:30:22.316 --> 00:30:24.086
Gosh, my clothes.

340
00:30:24.086 --> 00:30:25.487
I will be right back.

341
00:30:25.687 --> 00:30:27.316
I will get changed and wash myself.

342
00:30:55.146 --> 00:30:57.586
Were you able to release your anger...

343
00:30:57.586 --> 00:30:59.457
when you piled up the fortunes that you could not even use?

344
00:31:03.626 --> 00:31:06.096
Is it good to work here?

345
00:31:06.457 --> 00:31:08.326
Yes, it is.

346
00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.896
Doctors should never forget...

347
00:31:11.896 --> 00:31:15.507
the reason why they wanted to become a doctor in the first place.

348
00:31:15.507 --> 00:31:19.307
They must remember their first intention until the end.

349
00:31:23.606 --> 00:31:25.346
I'm going to remember...

350
00:31:25.646 --> 00:31:27.146
what you really are in my heart.

351
00:31:31.886 --> 00:31:33.586
(Director Ma)

352
00:31:47.437 --> 00:31:49.906
(Yoo Jae Ha)

353
00:32:19.096 --> 00:32:21.537
What about Yeon Kyung? Where is she?

354
00:32:21.537 --> 00:32:23.307
She is at the hospital now.

355
00:32:24.267 --> 00:32:25.636
But she is a bit hurt.

356
00:32:26.707 --> 00:32:28.076
Thank you for what you did yesterday.

357
00:32:31.376 --> 00:32:33.116
I didn't do it for your sake.

358
00:32:59.807 --> 00:33:01.507
Are you okay?

359
00:33:01.707 --> 00:33:03.376
How hurt are you?

360
00:33:03.846 --> 00:33:05.316
Let me take a look.

361
00:33:06.616 --> 00:33:08.116
Jae Ha, I'm okay.

362
00:33:08.747 --> 00:33:10.217
You must have been very worried.

363
00:33:10.386 --> 00:33:11.517
I'm...

364
00:33:12.287 --> 00:33:13.987
really okay.

365
00:33:14.416 --> 00:33:16.687
You disappeared and came back hurt.

366
00:33:19.057 --> 00:33:20.057
Are you okay?

367
00:33:20.057 --> 00:33:21.356
Oh, that?

368
00:33:22.096 --> 00:33:23.826
It's nothing.

369
00:33:25.037 --> 00:33:27.136
I was pricked by a sharp tree branch.

370
00:33:27.336 --> 00:33:29.307
I just had a few stitches.

371
00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:30.566
But...

372
00:33:31.437 --> 00:33:32.836
I'm really okay.

373
00:33:33.507 --> 00:33:34.507
Jae Ha.

374
00:33:36.406 --> 00:33:37.547
Sit down here.

375
00:33:45.586 --> 00:33:48.557
It's about the incident you saw that day.

376
00:33:48.886 --> 00:33:50.227
That's okay.

377
00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:52.557
Please don't say anything.

378
00:33:55.426 --> 00:33:58.197
I heard you helped him yesterday.

379
00:33:59.967 --> 00:34:01.096
Thank you.

380
00:34:02.037 --> 00:34:03.106
I don't know...

381
00:34:04.336 --> 00:34:06.876
why you feel so distant suddenly.

382
00:34:07.906 --> 00:34:09.106
What are you talking about?

383
00:34:09.106 --> 00:34:11.946
You're the closest thing to a younger brother to me.

384
00:34:12.017 --> 00:34:13.076
Younger brother?

385
00:34:14.176 --> 00:34:15.587
Okay, I understand.

386
00:34:15.886 --> 00:34:18.656
- Jae Ha. - What should I do now?

387
00:34:20.386 --> 00:34:21.486
About him...

388
00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:24.287
and about you.

389
00:34:34.837 --> 00:34:36.837
You're back from Joseon.

390
00:34:37.267 --> 00:34:38.276
Why?

391
00:34:38.406 --> 00:34:41.647
Do you still have lingering attachment to that place?

392
00:34:44.176 --> 00:34:45.317
Have you also met...

393
00:34:46.017 --> 00:34:48.216
Master Heo?

394
00:34:50.087 --> 00:34:51.817
Mr. Choi from Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic,

395
00:34:52.216 --> 00:34:53.587
you, and Master Heo.

396
00:34:54.517 --> 00:34:56.457
What happened between the three of you?

397
00:34:56.457 --> 00:34:58.357
Why would you want to rake over the past?

398
00:34:58.357 --> 00:34:59.957
It has nothing to do with you.

399
00:35:00.397 --> 00:35:01.526
You should just focus on...

400
00:35:01.826 --> 00:35:04.196
what you want to acquire from me.

401
00:35:06.567 --> 00:35:09.406
We have a business relationship.

402
00:35:11.937 --> 00:35:14.776
I did everything for you.

403
00:35:14.837 --> 00:35:17.247
From eating, living,

404
00:35:17.807 --> 00:35:19.147
and everything.

405
00:35:19.477 --> 00:35:21.946
I even prepared for your future.

406
00:35:22.247 --> 00:35:23.517
Did you already forget that?

407
00:35:24.017 --> 00:35:25.187
Of course not.

408
00:35:25.787 --> 00:35:28.656
How could I forget your kindness?

409
00:35:30.756 --> 00:35:31.997
That's right.

410
00:35:32.397 --> 00:35:34.897
That's why I like you.

411
00:35:49.846 --> 00:35:52.517
Let's talk for a minute.

412
00:35:54.276 --> 00:35:55.386
Okay.

413
00:35:58.256 --> 00:35:59.616
This is ridiculous.

414
00:35:59.787 --> 00:36:02.926
How could someone like him become the royal physician of Joseon?

415
00:36:09.397 --> 00:36:10.926
What do you want to say?

416
00:36:17.366 --> 00:36:19.477
Aren't you ashamed of yourself right now?

417
00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:22.676
Why should I be ashamed in front of you?

418
00:36:22.676 --> 00:36:24.576
When will you quit here?

419
00:36:24.776 --> 00:36:25.917
You're using someone else's name to be here.

420
00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:29.346
I know that you already found a way to kick me out.

421
00:36:32.417 --> 00:36:34.156
What will you do with Yeon Kyung?

422
00:36:34.957 --> 00:36:38.357
You'll go back anyway.

423
00:36:40.926 --> 00:36:42.627
If it's because of that,

424
00:36:43.526 --> 00:36:44.627
you don't have to worry.

425
00:36:45.767 --> 00:36:46.997
That won't happen.

426
00:36:57.747 --> 00:37:00.917
Aren't you going to tell what really happened?

427
00:37:00.917 --> 00:37:03.647
Who did this? Who bore a knife wound to you?

428
00:37:03.647 --> 00:37:05.716
Please don't be angry, it's not good for your liver.

429
00:37:05.716 --> 00:37:07.486
How can I not be angry?

430
00:37:07.486 --> 00:37:09.886
She has a scar now. What are you going to do about that?

431
00:37:10.957 --> 00:37:12.196
I'm really okay.

432
00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:13.997
Tell me who did it.

433
00:37:13.997 --> 00:37:15.826
I'm going to break them to pieces.

434
00:37:15.826 --> 00:37:17.796
Excuse me.

435
00:37:20.966 --> 00:37:22.607
This is a ward.

436
00:37:22.636 --> 00:37:25.107
Don't you know that you should be quiet in a hospital?

437
00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:26.276
What?

438
00:37:26.537 --> 00:37:29.776
Especially, Dr. Choi doesn't like it when people make a fuss...

439
00:37:29.776 --> 00:37:31.046
at a ward.

440
00:37:31.046 --> 00:37:33.147
I kind of don't like it.

441
00:37:34.276 --> 00:37:37.517
I know. I'm also a nurse.

442
00:37:37.517 --> 00:37:39.486
- Don't I? - Of course.

443
00:37:39.986 --> 00:37:42.357
If you're going to continue making a fuss like this,

444
00:37:42.787 --> 00:37:44.026
please leave.

445
00:37:46.057 --> 00:37:49.127
Yes, grandfather will wait for you. Go home now.

446
00:37:49.127 --> 00:37:50.997
Yes, Ms. Nurse.

447
00:37:51.667 --> 00:37:53.366
Let's go. Mr. Choi will wait for us.

448
00:37:53.366 --> 00:37:55.667
Text me the name of who did this to you.

449
00:37:59.307 --> 00:38:02.477
Yeon Kyung, are you okay? You look so thin.

450
00:38:02.477 --> 00:38:04.917
Are you eating well? Does the hospital meals suit your taste?

451
00:38:04.917 --> 00:38:06.676
- You're very considerate. - Yes, I am.

452
00:38:07.417 --> 00:38:08.986
We'll come back.

453
00:38:09.317 --> 00:38:10.446
Goodbye.

454
00:38:21.397 --> 00:38:23.167
I guess your friend became your boyfriend.

455
00:38:23.866 --> 00:38:25.596
- What? - It's worth the wait...

456
00:38:25.596 --> 00:38:27.437
and trusting you.

457
00:38:28.267 --> 00:38:29.267
So...

458
00:38:30.006 --> 00:38:31.236
do you know now?

459
00:38:31.906 --> 00:38:33.207
Know what?

460
00:38:33.437 --> 00:38:35.247
The true side of that person.

461
00:38:38.046 --> 00:38:39.046
Yes.

462
00:38:40.817 --> 00:38:41.986
I know now.

463
00:38:43.616 --> 00:38:44.616
I know everything now.

464
00:38:50.026 --> 00:38:52.156
Why were you staring so hard?

465
00:38:52.256 --> 00:38:54.326
Me? I didn't do that.

466
00:38:54.326 --> 00:38:55.767
You almost pierced her with your gaze.

467
00:38:55.767 --> 00:38:56.826
No.

468
00:38:57.227 --> 00:38:59.497
Mr. Choi keeps saying...

469
00:38:59.636 --> 00:39:02.567
that his heart feels stiff.

470
00:39:02.567 --> 00:39:04.366
Shouldn't we tell Yeon Kyung about that?

471
00:39:04.537 --> 00:39:05.937
What if Mr. Choi founds out?

472
00:39:05.937 --> 00:39:07.906
What will happen then?

473
00:39:09.607 --> 00:39:10.846
He's hurting too frequently.

474
00:39:10.846 --> 00:39:12.176
Are you two here?

475
00:39:14.986 --> 00:39:16.017
Who is he?

476
00:39:17.247 --> 00:39:18.357
He's Bong Tak.

477
00:39:19.216 --> 00:39:20.417
It is me.

478
00:39:25.756 --> 00:39:27.826
You must have come to see Yeon Kyung.

479
00:39:27.826 --> 00:39:30.026
Why did you not spend some more time with her?

480
00:39:31.466 --> 00:39:32.466
You're right.

481
00:39:33.636 --> 00:39:37.207
Is my mother doing okay?

482
00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:40.107
Yes, she's a lot better.

483
00:39:40.937 --> 00:39:42.307
That is good.

484
00:39:44.846 --> 00:39:47.446
I wonder if Bong Sik is doing okay.

485
00:39:47.446 --> 00:39:49.587
He must miss his brother a lot.

486
00:39:49.747 --> 00:39:50.817
You're right.

487
00:39:51.687 --> 00:39:53.857
You two must be busy.

488
00:39:53.857 --> 00:39:56.026
- I will see you next time. - Yes.

489
00:40:02.727 --> 00:40:04.966
- Be careful on your way. - Yes.

490
00:40:05.296 --> 00:40:06.296
- Oh, my. - Okay.

491
00:40:06.296 --> 00:40:07.866
- Let us stop. - Okay.

492
00:40:11.837 --> 00:40:12.837
What was that?

493
00:40:13.136 --> 00:40:15.647
You said he changed, that he was a complete brat.

494
00:40:15.647 --> 00:40:18.276
That's strange, he was a complete brat.

495
00:40:18.276 --> 00:40:19.676
You must be wrong.

496
00:40:19.676 --> 00:40:22.317
Did you see his shoes? Look at his shoes.

497
00:40:22.317 --> 00:40:24.116
That is amazing.

498
00:40:24.446 --> 00:40:26.087
Did I see wrong?

499
00:40:29.526 --> 00:40:30.886
Mr. Choi keeps saying...

500
00:40:31.087 --> 00:40:34.196
that his heart feels stiff.

501
00:40:47.406 --> 00:40:48.776
His heart...

502
00:41:03.886 --> 00:41:05.656
My mind must have forgotten about it,

503
00:41:06.596 --> 00:41:08.767
but my hands remembered...

504
00:41:09.596 --> 00:41:12.397
the moment my dad's heart stopped.

505
00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:17.837
Here.

506
00:41:18.107 --> 00:41:20.877
I wanted to become someone who made your heart beat.

507
00:41:26.747 --> 00:41:29.116
You saved countless lives with these hands.

508
00:41:29.486 --> 00:41:31.817
It must be a gift from your father.

509
00:41:33.216 --> 00:41:35.957
It might be an assignment.

510
00:41:44.866 --> 00:41:46.267
This acupuncture point is called "Nokeum".

511
00:41:46.466 --> 00:41:49.236
When you press here when your heart is tired and exhausted,

512
00:41:49.236 --> 00:41:52.037
your mind will become clear and lively.

513
00:41:54.076 --> 00:41:55.107
Do you know that?

514
00:41:56.176 --> 00:41:59.817
Our acupuncture points contain the principle of the universe.

515
00:42:02.647 --> 00:42:05.756
"Gok" from "Hapgok" means valley.

516
00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:08.326
"Gye" from "Yanggye" means stream.

517
00:42:10.156 --> 00:42:11.457
"Gokji" means pond.

518
00:42:12.227 --> 00:42:13.557
"Byunjung" means well.

519
00:42:14.326 --> 00:42:15.526
"Pungji" means...

520
00:42:20.736 --> 00:42:22.636
wind.

521
00:42:30.307 --> 00:42:32.917
Our face also has acupuncture points.

00:42:44.687 --> 00:42:46.026

529
00:44:23.317 --> 00:44:25.817
(Shinhae Hospital)

530
00:44:30.226 --> 00:44:31.357
Yeon Kyung.

531
00:44:32.027 --> 00:44:36.197
You haven't recovered fully yet. You shouldn't be working like this.

532
00:44:36.967 --> 00:44:38.996
I know it's hard for you to take care of my patients too.

533
00:44:38.996 --> 00:44:43.467
I feel so bad whenever I see your dark circles under your eyes.

534
00:44:43.936 --> 00:44:46.376
It's not like you don't want to owe me, is it?

535
00:44:46.777 --> 00:44:47.976
Of course not.

536
00:44:47.976 --> 00:44:50.007
Yeon Kyung, are you sure you're okay?

537
00:44:50.007 --> 00:44:52.447
Your wound seemed like it needed quite some time to heal.

538
00:44:52.447 --> 00:44:54.047
What if it worsens?

539
00:44:54.376 --> 00:44:55.717
I'm okay.

540
00:44:57.186 --> 00:45:00.387
I got treatment from Dr. Heo Jun.

541
00:45:03.657 --> 00:45:05.027
The Heo Jun who wrote...

542
00:45:05.626 --> 00:45:06.797
"Principles and Practice of Eastern Medicine".

543
00:45:08.297 --> 00:45:09.427
You can't trust me, can you?

544
00:45:09.427 --> 00:45:11.896
It's not like I can't trust you.

545
00:45:13.166 --> 00:45:17.107
Our ancestors' medical practices are incredible.

546
00:45:19.907 --> 00:45:23.306
Shouldn't we do a MRI scan on her head?

547
00:45:23.607 --> 00:45:26.547
The power of love is even more incredible.

548
00:45:26.677 --> 00:45:28.547
- What? - Let's just go.

549
00:45:39.956 --> 00:45:44.467
I was surprised to see the ambulance and hospital when I first came here.

550
00:45:48.306 --> 00:45:50.536
I was impressed that people in this world...

551
00:45:50.737 --> 00:45:52.806
can get treatment whenever they feel sick.

552
00:45:55.346 --> 00:45:59.476
Those patients outside will never be able to see a doctor's face.

553
00:46:02.246 --> 00:46:05.357
I applied acupuncture and moxa to unclog their blocked vessels.

554
00:46:05.556 --> 00:46:06.857
It is suffocating,

555
00:46:07.456 --> 00:46:09.427
but that is the only thing I can do for them now.

556
00:46:09.527 --> 00:46:11.527
He's feeling pain in his chest all of a sudden.

557
00:46:11.527 --> 00:46:13.857
- Does your chest hurt? - Goodness.

558
00:46:14.157 --> 00:46:15.427
I can't breathe.

559
00:46:15.427 --> 00:46:18.197
Is the pain like stabbing or tightening?

560
00:46:25.436 --> 00:46:27.436
I'll apply acupuncture...

561
00:46:27.637 --> 00:46:29.507
- from this point. - Okay.

562
00:46:29.507 --> 00:46:31.376
Please lie down first.

563
00:46:31.376 --> 00:46:33.246
- Okay. - Be careful.

564
00:46:34.646 --> 00:46:35.916
- Sir. - Goodness.

565
00:46:36.387 --> 00:46:37.846
It's the other way around.

566
00:46:38.157 --> 00:46:41.587
I know you always disagree with me.

567
00:46:44.956 --> 00:46:47.126
I told you it is not the spot.

568
00:46:47.956 --> 00:46:51.126
I told you several times that you need to apply acupuncture...

569
00:46:52.337 --> 00:46:53.596
on the other side of the painful spot.

570
00:46:54.036 --> 00:46:57.107
You are not a fool. I will do it myself if you excuse me.

571
00:47:01.476 --> 00:47:03.677
- Please face upwards. - Okay.

572
00:47:07.346 --> 00:47:08.516
Seungjang.

573
00:47:09.746 --> 00:47:10.887
Here.

574
00:47:20.927 --> 00:47:22.197
Seungjang.

575
00:47:29.166 --> 00:47:30.306
Dr. Heo?

576
00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:31.976
Yes?

577
00:47:33.876 --> 00:47:35.677
It is such a nice acupuncture spot.

578
00:47:37.677 --> 00:47:41.916
I get distracted whenever I see that acupuncture spot.

579
00:47:44.447 --> 00:47:47.657
I shouldn't feel this way when I'm treating male patients.

580
00:47:50.357 --> 00:47:52.226
How is it?

581
00:47:56.996 --> 00:47:58.137
It doesn't hurt anymore.

582
00:47:59.496 --> 00:48:00.596
Awesome.

583
00:48:02.737 --> 00:48:03.806
What?

584
00:48:05.237 --> 00:48:07.806
Make sure you do not forget about this next time.

585
00:48:07.806 --> 00:48:10.806
Do not make me repeat myself again.

586
00:48:14.317 --> 00:48:15.587
Fools.

587
00:48:15.987 --> 00:48:17.686
Goodness.

588
00:48:20.817 --> 00:48:22.387
So what?

589
00:48:22.387 --> 00:48:24.996
Doctors may have different ways of treating their patients.

590
00:48:25.697 --> 00:48:26.996
Am I wrong?

591
00:48:27.456 --> 00:48:29.467
You should as well jump on his band wagon.

592
00:48:31.596 --> 00:48:33.837
You need to look far ahead into the future.

593
00:48:34.666 --> 00:48:36.867
Otherwise, you will stay in your well forever.

594
00:48:37.936 --> 00:48:39.576
- Sir? - Yes.

595
00:48:39.677 --> 00:48:42.007
We are done with your oriental treatment.

596
00:48:42.007 --> 00:48:43.306
Yes, thank you.

597
00:48:46.117 --> 00:48:47.476
Okay.

598
00:48:47.476 --> 00:48:49.286
And then I...

599
00:48:49.286 --> 00:48:51.487
There's the doctor.

600
00:48:53.317 --> 00:48:54.617
Goodbye.

601
00:49:21.447 --> 00:49:22.846
It can't be.

602
00:49:43.436 --> 00:49:44.876
Are you a cardiothoracic doctor?

603
00:49:45.476 --> 00:49:46.637
That's right.

604
00:49:47.007 --> 00:49:48.706
- Was it a car accident? - Yes.

605
00:49:48.706 --> 00:49:51.007
We told you about him beforehand. He is a patient with aortic dissection.

606
00:49:53.177 --> 00:49:54.246
Let's go.

607
00:49:58.286 --> 00:49:59.286
Give it to me.

608
00:50:02.456 --> 00:50:04.186
Can I take a look at the record?

609
00:50:04.286 --> 00:50:07.056
He was driving when it happened. He hit his chest on the wheel.

610
00:50:07.056 --> 00:50:09.226
We did a CT scan on him and found that his ascending aorta ruptured.

611
00:50:09.726 --> 00:50:11.797
Is he the patient with aortic dissection?

612
00:50:11.797 --> 00:50:13.396
Yes, did you receive any words from the professor?

613
00:50:13.396 --> 00:50:15.467
He said to take him in first.

614
00:50:15.467 --> 00:50:17.007
- Is that the result of his CT scan? - Yes.

615
00:50:19.376 --> 00:50:22.206
- Who will operate on him? - I'm not sure yet.

616
00:50:36.126 --> 00:50:38.226
Operation is one problem,

617
00:50:38.726 --> 00:50:41.927
but he won't be able to recover even if it's done successfully.

618
00:50:42.166 --> 00:50:45.837
Right, he's unconscious at the moment too.

619
00:50:45.967 --> 00:50:47.697
He has multiple injuries,

620
00:50:48.137 --> 00:50:51.876
so I think we need to operate on him with doctors in other departments.

621
00:50:52.107 --> 00:50:55.277
Still, you specialize in operations regarding aortic dissection.

622
00:50:55.277 --> 00:50:56.947
Well, that's...

623
00:50:57.507 --> 00:51:00.677
I'm scheduled with another operation soon.

624
00:51:02.387 --> 00:51:04.317
- What do you think, Dr. Hwang? - Pardon?

625
00:51:06.056 --> 00:51:09.786
I need to head to a conference with the director soon.

626
00:51:13.697 --> 00:51:15.527
This is the third hospital.

627
00:51:15.626 --> 00:51:17.367
He has nowhere else to go.

628
00:51:17.496 --> 00:51:19.536
Can't you do something?

629
00:51:19.996 --> 00:51:22.706
The patient's condition is serious.

630
00:51:22.706 --> 00:51:26.507
He's unconscious and aged too.

631
00:51:26.637 --> 00:51:29.206
The probability of success is low.

632
00:51:29.947 --> 00:51:31.717
He might not able to recover even if...

633
00:51:32.177 --> 00:51:33.447
Mom.

634
00:51:35.547 --> 00:51:36.617
Doctor.

635
00:51:37.087 --> 00:51:38.817
Please save my dad.

636
00:51:38.887 --> 00:51:41.927
He worked so hard for 30 years so that he could raise us.

637
00:51:42.226 --> 00:51:43.956
Next month,

638
00:51:43.956 --> 00:51:46.096
he was going to go on his first trip with Mom.

639
00:51:46.226 --> 00:51:48.596
He had been saving the money for 10 years.

640
00:51:49.166 --> 00:51:51.697
He cannot die like that.

641
00:51:51.936 --> 00:51:54.567
He deserves a happy life.

642
00:51:55.036 --> 00:51:59.177
Please let him have a surgery. Please, doctor.

643
00:52:06.146 --> 00:52:09.587
According to the director, he said...

644
00:52:09.587 --> 00:52:10.617
Professor.

645
00:52:10.617 --> 00:52:12.786
- What is it? - Hello.

646
00:52:12.987 --> 00:52:15.087
The patient in the emergency room with aortic dissection...

647
00:52:15.556 --> 00:52:17.357
might die soon...

648
00:52:17.587 --> 00:52:19.226
if we do not operate on him.

649
00:52:20.826 --> 00:52:24.266
His family wants his operation too.

650
00:52:24.697 --> 00:52:26.536
Please think it over again.

651
00:52:26.536 --> 00:52:27.867
Gosh, Yeon Kyung.

652
00:52:28.367 --> 00:52:30.766
Weren't you listening?

653
00:52:30.766 --> 00:52:33.436
There was no bleeding according to the brain CT.

654
00:52:34.277 --> 00:52:37.447
It's not impossible that he might regain consciousness again.

655
00:52:39.076 --> 00:52:42.047
I do realize that the operation will not be easy.

656
00:52:42.047 --> 00:52:43.547
What are you doing?

657
00:52:43.547 --> 00:52:45.587
You're not in your first year as intern.

658
00:52:45.587 --> 00:52:48.387
There are too many surgeries as it is.

659
00:52:50.757 --> 00:52:51.757
In that case,

660
00:52:53.527 --> 00:52:55.226
I will operate on him.

661
00:52:57.527 --> 00:52:58.536
What?

662
00:53:01.907 --> 00:53:03.907
I know it's not because you cannot do this.

663
00:53:04.067 --> 00:53:05.507
You simply don't have the time.

664
00:53:07.507 --> 00:53:09.876
So I will do it instead.

665
00:53:11.346 --> 00:53:12.617
Please allow me to.

666
00:53:13.346 --> 00:53:15.916
Hey, Choi Yeon Kyung.

667
00:53:15.916 --> 00:53:19.516
You are so confident now that professors have complimented you...

668
00:53:20.117 --> 00:53:21.456
on what little talent you have, aren't you?

669
00:53:21.987 --> 00:53:23.626
It's not like that.

670
00:53:25.826 --> 00:53:26.927
It's just that...

671
00:53:27.626 --> 00:53:30.826
I want to do my best as a doctor.

672
00:53:31.197 --> 00:53:33.837
It's not an easy operation that takes 1 or 2 hours.

673
00:53:34.197 --> 00:53:36.706
Your wounds on your back haven't been healed yet.

674
00:53:36.706 --> 00:53:39.177
You can't perform a surgery that takes about 5 to 6 hours.

675
00:53:40.107 --> 00:53:43.607
I think you need to experience DOT again to think straight.

676
00:53:43.607 --> 00:53:44.677
Sir.

677
00:53:44.677 --> 00:53:45.876
What?

678
00:53:48.447 --> 00:53:49.817
Why not?

679
00:53:51.416 --> 00:53:53.757
- What? - We have everything...

680
00:53:54.617 --> 00:53:57.056
from doctors, medical equipment,

681
00:53:58.157 --> 00:53:59.657
and medicines.

682
00:54:01.396 --> 00:54:03.027
Why can't we operate on him?

683
00:54:06.837 --> 00:54:08.337
I'll get his family's consent...

684
00:54:08.607 --> 00:54:10.436
and start the operation.

685
00:54:10.666 --> 00:54:12.536
- What? - Wait.

686
00:54:12.637 --> 00:54:14.777
Hey, Choi Yeon Kyung! Hey!

687
00:54:22.587 --> 00:54:25.186
Professor Lee was so angry,

688
00:54:25.186 --> 00:54:27.916
and he made a big fuss about it with Professor Hwang.

689
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:30.456
He was blaming him for not teaching you properly as an academic adviser.

690
00:54:32.297 --> 00:54:33.657
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

691
00:54:34.697 --> 00:54:35.896
Are you sure you can do this?

692
00:54:36.166 --> 00:54:37.697
The surgery or the professors?

693
00:54:39.367 --> 00:54:40.637
If you're talking about the surgery,

694
00:54:41.666 --> 00:54:43.266
I'll do my best.

695
00:54:44.436 --> 00:54:47.277
If you're talking about professors, I'll just accept the consequences.

696
00:54:57.817 --> 00:54:59.587
Dr. Choi, are you all right?

697
00:54:59.587 --> 00:55:00.817
I heard you were hurt.

698
00:55:00.817 --> 00:55:02.027
I'm fine.

699
00:55:03.157 --> 00:55:04.996
- Kim Min Jae. - Yes?

700
00:55:05.357 --> 00:55:06.527
Are you ready?

701
00:55:06.556 --> 00:55:10.096
Yes, I'm ready, but I...

702
00:55:35.056 --> 00:55:36.826
- Kim Min Jae. - Yes?

703
00:55:37.857 --> 00:55:39.527
Is this your first time performing aorta replacement?

704
00:55:39.527 --> 00:55:43.166
Yes. I only heard that it's difficult.

705
00:55:43.326 --> 00:55:45.096
I'm doing this for the first time.

706
00:55:47.266 --> 00:55:48.806
I'm nervous too.

707
00:55:50.766 --> 00:55:51.907
Let's do this.

708
00:55:52.507 --> 00:55:53.507
Yes.

709
00:55:54.907 --> 00:55:56.677
I'm a Cardiothoracic fellow, Choi Yeon Kyung.

710
00:55:56.677 --> 00:55:59.076
I'm going to perform aorta replacement.

711
00:55:59.777 --> 00:56:00.777
Scalpel.

712
00:56:10.765 --> 00:56:11.905
He is called Chairman Min.

713
00:56:11.905 --> 00:56:14.805
He owns the best company in the distribution industry.

714
00:56:15.376 --> 00:56:16.675
What's his problem?

715
00:56:17.245 --> 00:56:18.845
He's not sick.

716
00:56:18.845 --> 00:56:20.175
He heard you were famous,

717
00:56:20.175 --> 00:56:22.745
and he wanted you to feel his pulse for diagnosis.

718
00:56:24.015 --> 00:56:25.486
He's paying a lot...

719
00:56:25.916 --> 00:56:27.316
for you to feel his pulse.

720
00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:42.066
These are all spoiled.

721
00:56:42.236 --> 00:56:43.506
He wants everything...

722
00:56:43.506 --> 00:56:45.876
when he can't even eat them all. Of course they get spoiled.

723
00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:48.506
Gosh, more goes into the trash than into his mouth.

724
00:56:48.945 --> 00:56:51.376
Gosh, this is such a waste.

725
00:56:51.876 --> 00:56:53.215
What should we do?

726
00:56:53.515 --> 00:56:56.986
Do you have a lot of ginseng in your world?

727
00:56:57.115 --> 00:56:58.586
Ginseng?

728
00:57:00.186 --> 00:57:01.215
Yes.

729
00:57:02.425 --> 00:57:03.486
Why?

730
00:57:03.486 --> 00:57:06.325
The soldiers are dehydrated, and they have lost a lot of blood.

731
00:57:06.956 --> 00:57:08.566
If we have some ginseng,

732
00:57:08.566 --> 00:57:10.825
we'd be able to help them regain their strength and blood.

733
00:57:32.986 --> 00:57:34.615
Hello.

734
00:57:35.655 --> 00:57:37.655
I'm sorry I was late after I invited you.

735
00:57:37.655 --> 00:57:39.825
We just arrived.

736
00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:43.925
By the way, you look so much younger compared to last year.

737
00:57:43.925 --> 00:57:46.336
- Really? - Yes.

738
00:57:47.296 --> 00:57:48.805
Do you want to know the secret?

739
00:57:48.805 --> 00:57:50.066
The secret?

740
00:57:50.336 --> 00:57:51.405
Follow me.

741
00:57:55.945 --> 00:57:58.845
This isn't just a snake.

742
00:57:58.845 --> 00:58:01.445
This is a snake that ate a toad.

743
00:58:01.445 --> 00:58:02.546
Gosh.

744
00:58:03.115 --> 00:58:06.086
This is the best thing for men's stamina.

745
00:58:06.086 --> 00:58:09.986
Of course, Chairman Min. I'd expect no less from you.

746
00:58:10.686 --> 00:58:13.526
Stamina is like power for men.

747
00:58:13.526 --> 00:58:14.995
Of course.

748
00:58:16.695 --> 00:58:19.465
Here. Please be careful with this.

749
00:58:19.765 --> 00:58:23.106
You can't even buy this with few years of your salary.

750
00:58:23.206 --> 00:58:25.405
And bring us the tea I ordered.

751
00:58:28.075 --> 00:58:29.206
- Here. - Thank you.

752
00:58:34.416 --> 00:58:37.686
This is a tea that was made out of a seal's penis...

753
00:58:38.186 --> 00:58:40.385
after it was dried and boiled.

754
00:58:40.456 --> 00:58:42.726
You bought it?

755
00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:45.756
- This is really rare. - The Chief of...

756
00:58:45.756 --> 00:58:49.166
Ministry of Strategy and Finance bought it on his business trip.

757
00:58:49.796 --> 00:58:52.336
That is why...

758
00:58:52.336 --> 00:58:53.965
I pulled some strings for him.

759
00:58:53.965 --> 00:58:55.206
Yes.

760
00:58:55.905 --> 00:58:57.865
You seem to know more...

761
00:58:57.865 --> 00:59:00.476
than I do about health, and I am an oriental doctor.

762
00:59:01.845 --> 00:59:03.876
So I brought him...

763
00:59:04.046 --> 00:59:05.816
so that he can learn from you.

764
00:59:06.146 --> 00:59:07.515
I'm Heo Bong Tak.

765
00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.615
I've heard a lot about you.

766
00:59:10.615 --> 00:59:12.615
You're younger than I thought you'd be.

767
00:59:13.155 --> 00:59:15.785
You should feel my pulse.

768
00:59:21.195 --> 00:59:22.796
I know what you'll say.

769
00:59:22.796 --> 00:59:26.796
Most oriental doctors tell me that I'll live until I'm 100 years old.

770
00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:28.506
People still think...

771
00:59:28.506 --> 00:59:31.206
- that I am in my 40s. - Be quiet.

772
00:59:34.035 --> 00:59:36.675
You are interrupting me while I feel your pulse.

773
00:59:41.046 --> 00:59:42.945
Oh, my.

774
00:59:45.586 --> 00:59:47.385
How can this be?

775
00:59:49.126 --> 00:59:51.055
Oh, my.

776
00:59:51.226 --> 00:59:53.796
What is it?

777
00:59:53.796 --> 00:59:56.195
Wait for a moment.

778
00:59:56.425 --> 00:59:57.425
Excuse me.

779
00:59:57.796 --> 00:59:58.796
Wait.

780
01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:11.776
You must be crazy.

781
01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:14.575
What are you doing? Do you know how much that costs?

782
01:00:14.575 --> 01:00:16.416
Dr. Heo, what are you doing?

783
01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.555
(Operation time, 5 hours and 12 minutes)

784
01:00:40.276 --> 01:00:42.805
Min Jae, grab it properly. Let go of one hand.

785
01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:44.776
Yes, I'm sorry.

786
01:00:44.876 --> 01:00:47.575
If you do a good job, the time on a heart-lung machine will decrease.

787
01:00:47.575 --> 01:00:49.445
That will increase the possibility of the patient to live.

788
01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:53.186
- Be alert. - Yes.

789
01:01:03.865 --> 01:01:06.166
No matter how good medicine is,

790
01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:07.965
it will be poison to you if it doesn't fit you.

791
01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:12.206
Before a snake eats it, toads are full of poison.

792
01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:16.075
It is most poisonous to people with high blood pressure like you.

793
01:01:16.075 --> 01:01:17.945
Poison?

794
01:01:18.316 --> 01:01:19.546
Also,

795
01:01:19.745 --> 01:01:21.715
the penis of a seal...

796
01:01:22.115 --> 01:01:24.646
adds energy to your male parts.

797
01:01:24.785 --> 01:01:28.115
If someone that originally has a lot of heat like you eats it,

798
01:01:28.925 --> 01:01:31.425
it will be like adding oil to fire.

799
01:01:31.825 --> 01:01:32.856
Here.

800
01:01:35.566 --> 01:01:36.666
Here.

801
01:01:41.635 --> 01:01:43.765
Everyone should have a drink.

802
01:01:43.765 --> 01:01:45.075
What is he doing?

803
01:01:45.075 --> 01:01:46.606
It is poison to you,

804
01:01:46.606 --> 01:01:49.845
but it is good medicine to these ladies who lack energy.

805
01:01:50.175 --> 01:01:53.115
What are you doing? Have a drink.

806
01:01:54.675 --> 01:01:58.046
Oh, my. Do you know how expensive those were?

807
01:01:58.046 --> 01:02:00.356
Dr. Heo, what are you doing?

808
01:02:01.015 --> 01:02:03.186
Also, expensive medicine like deer antlers and ginseng...

809
01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:06.595
are useless poison to an energetic man like you.

810
01:02:07.325 --> 01:02:10.695
Take as much as you want before he throws them all away.

811
01:02:10.695 --> 01:02:13.035
Hurry up, it might rot.

812
01:02:14.336 --> 01:02:16.166
Is he crazy?

813
01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:19.476
Leave. Get out of my house.

814
01:02:19.476 --> 01:02:20.976
Oh, my.

815
01:02:20.976 --> 01:02:22.976
- Oh, my. - Please come here.

816
01:02:33.686 --> 01:02:36.456
- Can I check your pulse? - What?

817
01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.256
Yes.

818
01:02:45.465 --> 01:02:47.836
How long has your throat been hoarse?

819
01:02:48.305 --> 01:02:51.135
It's been a few months.

820
01:02:52.836 --> 01:02:54.405
You're coughing slightly...

821
01:02:54.976 --> 01:02:56.476
right now and a moment ago.

822
01:02:57.575 --> 01:02:59.816
Your lungs aren't moist and dry.

823
01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:02.046
That's why you sound hoarse.

824
01:03:02.046 --> 01:03:06.155
I thought it was a cold.

825
01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:09.925
I just took medicine for that.

826
01:03:11.526 --> 01:03:13.856
Can I apply acupuncture on you?

827
01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.095
(Man from Joseon)

828
01:05:12.015 --> 01:05:13.075
Yeon Kyung.

829
01:05:14.816 --> 01:05:16.115
Yes, Jae Ha.

830
01:05:16.816 --> 01:05:18.856
Are you here to see Bong Tak?

831
01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:20.885
I had something to say.

832
01:05:21.586 --> 01:05:24.325
- He must have gone home. - He wasn't here for the afternoon.

833
01:05:26.995 --> 01:05:28.865
Really?

834
01:05:31.126 --> 01:05:32.865
- Yeon Kyung. - Yes?

835
01:05:33.265 --> 01:05:35.405
You said you were getting to know him.

836
01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:37.405
Do you know everything about him?

837
01:05:39.336 --> 01:05:40.405
Yes.

838
01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:43.805
I do.

839
01:05:44.445 --> 01:05:45.515
No,

840
01:05:46.215 --> 01:05:47.416
you don't.

841
01:05:48.816 --> 01:05:51.115
- What? - You don't know who he is...

842
01:05:51.115 --> 01:05:53.686
and what kind of figure he is.

843
01:05:55.686 --> 01:05:57.086
What do you mean?

844
01:05:57.086 --> 01:06:00.226
He will go back one day.

845
01:06:00.655 --> 01:06:03.126
No, he has to go back.

846
01:06:09.535 --> 01:06:11.465
The receiver cannot pick up your call.

847
01:06:11.836 --> 01:06:13.736
Gosh.

848
01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:17.276
Where is he? He's not picking up his phone.

849
01:06:20.675 --> 01:06:24.116
(Letter of resignation)

850
01:06:32.396 --> 01:06:35.566
He will go back one day.

851
01:06:35.965 --> 01:06:38.366
No, he has to go back.

852
01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:14.566
Hello, there.

853
01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:16.536
Hello, there.

854
01:07:17.736 --> 01:07:19.675
Gosh. Hello, there.

855
01:07:19.675 --> 01:07:21.776
Is he out of his mind?

856
01:07:25.246 --> 01:07:27.116
Mr. Choi, I am here.

857
01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:30.616
You two should talk.

858
01:07:33.786 --> 01:07:35.085
He didn't pay for the taxi.

859
01:07:35.686 --> 01:07:39.226
It didn't cost a lot since we were here last time.

860
01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:40.955
Will you pay by card?

861
01:07:43.196 --> 01:07:44.835
Home sweet home.

862
01:07:45.696 --> 01:07:48.066
How were you? I am here.

863
01:07:55.106 --> 01:07:56.305
Yeon Kyung.

864
01:07:57.805 --> 01:08:00.146
I am here. I am back.

865
01:08:03.186 --> 01:08:06.116
You need to pay for your taxi.

866
01:08:41.786 --> 01:08:44.455
(Live Up To Your Name, Dr. Heo/Deserving of the Name)

867
01:08:44.925 --> 01:08:47.726
Did you meet that person?

868
01:08:48.026 --> 01:08:51.465
Yes, I met that person.

869
01:08:53.036 --> 01:08:54.496
This was that pulse.

870
01:08:54.835 --> 01:08:57.205
I think this pulse led me to you.

871
01:08:58.005 --> 01:08:59.635
What will you do with Yeon Kyung?

872
01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:02.276
You'll go back anyway.

873
01:09:02.545 --> 01:09:05.276
If it is because of that, you do not have to worry.

874
01:09:05.276 --> 01:09:06.515
That will not happen.

875
01:09:07.146 --> 01:09:11.385
I will never leave you alone again.

876
01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:13.585
That will never happen.
