1
00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:19.803
Were you really trying 
to find out the truth,

2
00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:21.338
or were you trying to hide it?

3
00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:23.540
I told you to shut it!

4
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.144
Are you saying there's an accomplice 
among the police?

5
00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.380
I couldn't find a trace of him.

6
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.849
Let me go. I must stop Sergeant Oh.

7
00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:36.420
Find Kim Hyun Jun now!

8
00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:37.821
No!

9
00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:40.390
I am sorry.

10
00:00:41.158 --> 00:00:42.159
(Mo Ji Eun)

11
00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:45.395
Can you give me some more time?

12
00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:46.763
Is it the Reaper?

13
00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:47.998
Wait a second.

14
00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:49.599
Please find my daughter.

15
00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:51.435
The three girls all left 
the same text message.

16
00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:53.236
Maybe they really did go on a trip?

17
00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.872
They had an important match coming up.

18
00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:00.944
They found traces of the girls.

19
00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:05.015
How were three fully grown 
girls taken all at once?

20
00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:06.316
The abductor had an accomplice,

21
00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.219
or if not, he could have waited 
until they were separated.

22
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.522
They were found 30 minutes ago.

23
00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:14.624
Someone damaged them on purpose.

24
00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:16.960
It looks like an abduction case 
motivated by vengeance.

25
00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:21.598
(National Crime Investigation)

26
00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:23.700
(Episode 15)

27
00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:27.170
The police conducted a search around 
where they found the bags,

28
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.073
but there was nothing unusual.

29
00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:33.210
Is there anything suspicious about 
where they found the bags?

30
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.613
Maybe that area symbolizes something or...

31
00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:39.416
No, it didn't seem that way.

32
00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:42.452
If the culprit left such a clear 
evidence like that,

33
00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:45.021
it surely means...

34
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.791
that the vacant lot is
 somewhere special to him.

35
00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:52.762
Find out if there's any connection 
with the girls and the parents.

36
00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:53.797
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.499
What are the jobs of the victims' parents?

38
00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.368
Lee Yoo Jin's parents work in the real estate leasing service.

39
00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:00.670
Park Song Yi's mom works at a local call center.

40
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.507
Hong Hye In's dad owns his own law firm.

41
00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:05.375
The nature of a job in real estate and law...

42
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:09.446
could bring about some unavoidable troubles with people.

43
00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:12.048
You want me to look into that too, right? Okay.

44
00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:14.584
We couldn't find any evidence of resistance at the swimming pool,

45
00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:17.053
where the abduction likely happened.

46
00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:20.423
The girls could have easily followed the culprit without a doubt.

47
00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:24.694
The way you can overpower someone without using any force...

48
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.531
is either you threaten the victim to lose their motivation to resist,

49
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:28.965
or you build up the trust beforehand.

50
00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:30.333
There's no other way.

51
00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.670
If the culprits actually overpowered the girls,

52
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.973
they must have planned it out thoroughly.

53
00:02:37.274 --> 00:02:39.109
They must have looked up the girls' schedule.

54
00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.012
They also must have observed the girls for a while.

55
00:02:42.312 --> 00:02:46.149
The culprit could be someone living here or coming here often.

56
00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:48.852
If an outsider was stalking the girls,

57
00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:51.087
someone must have thought it was very suspicious.

58
00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:53.023
It's been three days already.

59
00:02:53.623 --> 00:02:54.824
It actually looks like...

60
00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:57.460
the girls could be already...

61
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.230
I don't think so. The girls are still alive.

62
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:04.401
If you look at the message, it specifically mentions...

63
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:06.870
that she will come back on Friday night.

64
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.439
(I will come back by Friday night. Don't worry.)

65
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:13.510
As it has been repeatedly mentioned,

66
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.247
that means that day has a meaning to the culprit.

67
00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:21.718
The culprit must have chosen Friday as the D-day.

68
00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.689
We don't even have two days until Friday.

69
00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.891
Bring the victims' parents to the police station...

70
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:29.693
and prepare the profile.

71
00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:32.295
I will join you after I tidy up some things here.

72
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.430
Yes, sir.

73
00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:46.743
I am so cold.

74
00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:49.246
You are not the only one.

75
00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:52.082
I am cold,

76
00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:54.618
thirsty, and hungry too.

77
00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:57.254
Yoo Jin is sick. She even has a fever.

78
00:03:57.387 --> 00:03:59.022
You need to think carefully.

79
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.159
Don't just stay there, and stare into nothing.

80
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:07.530
Your whining won't do anything.

81
00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:09.799
Do you really need to talk like that?

82
00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:12.736
Then...

83
00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:16.439
how do you want me to talk?

84
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:21.544
We need to find a way to escape this place somehow.

85
00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:23.980
Being anxious won't change anything.

86
00:04:24.114 --> 00:04:25.115
What?

87
00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:29.653
You haven't even moved a finger. You don't deserve to say that.

88
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.523
Guys, we shouldn't do this.

89
00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:38.228
We're fighting against each other. This is what he wants.

90
00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:41.464
Why did he abduct us?

91
00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.142
It seems like I'm getting numb from the hunger.

92
00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:56.112
Where are we? How long have we been locked here?

93
00:04:56.346 --> 00:04:57.347
I wonder.

94
00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.950
It wasn't like this in boot camp.

95
00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:03.653
I shouldn't have listened to her.

96
00:05:05.622 --> 00:05:07.490
She's the one who talked us into...

97
00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:09.092
going to a club without telling our parents.

98
00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:18.034
Let us out of here! Let us out of here!

99
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:20.170
Stop it. You're only wasting energy.

100
00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:23.039
Get ahold of yourself.

101
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.776
We might die here.

102
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.261
What is happening?

103
00:05:46.196 --> 00:05:47.364
Hello.

104
00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:48.798
- He is Hye In's father. - Okay.

105
00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:52.235
Hello, we're from NCI.

106
00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.438
She texted me saying she was going out with her friends.

107
00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.907
What is this about?

108
00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:02.312
That is... At first, we thought that was what had happened.

109
00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:04.814
But it seems like something has gone wrong.

110
00:06:05.048 --> 00:06:08.518
So Hye In has really been abducted?

111
00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:11.287
I will explain everything, Mr. Hong.

112
00:06:12.722 --> 00:06:16.092
As you know well enough, Hong Hye In, Lee Yoo Jin,

113
00:06:16.192 --> 00:06:17.927
and Park Song Yi went missing three days ago.

114
00:06:18.395 --> 00:06:22.332
We believe that these students are still alive.

115
00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.935
If what the culprit wanted was murder,

116
00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:29.939
they could have been killed right away.

117
00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.643
But as the culprit didn't kill them, it could mean that...

118
00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:37.714
abducting them or locking them up was more important than murder.

119
00:06:37.914 --> 00:06:42.252
The culprit mentioned this Friday.

120
00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:47.657
It is highly possible that the culprit has a plan for that day.

121
00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.929
We also need to focus on the fact that there are three victims.

122
00:06:53.263 --> 00:06:55.765
There are not many cases in which numerous victims...

123
00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:57.200
are abducted together.

124
00:06:57.434 --> 00:07:00.170
The culprit must have had a personal reason...

125
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.071
for him to abduct three people.

126
00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:03.907
We believe that the culprit is acquainted with the victims,

127
00:07:03.907 --> 00:07:06.676
and that he knows this town very well.

128
00:07:07.143 --> 00:07:10.280
And seeing as the culprit did not leave any traces,

129
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.449
damaged the victims' properties,

130
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.818
and exhibited them,

131
00:07:14.918 --> 00:07:19.189
we think that it's highly likely that this was caused by a grudge.

132
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.526
A grudge? But they are just kids.

133
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.663
Who would have such a grudge in this small town?

134
00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:30.300
No, we should think not only about the victims,

135
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.670
but also their parents and the people around them.

136
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.841
But such connections will not surface easily.

137
00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:40.777
For cases like this, it is highly likely that...

138
00:07:40.777 --> 00:07:44.614
the culprit is smart and well-planned.

139
00:07:45.415 --> 00:07:48.284
The culprit plans the crime and watches the victims...

140
00:07:48.952 --> 00:07:52.155
until the right moment comes and he feels confident.

141
00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:53.656
Then he acts it out.

142
00:07:53.957 --> 00:07:54.958
(Hong Hye In)

143
00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.694
(Park Song Yi)

144
00:08:00.663 --> 00:08:04.501
He would have prepared a space to lock them in.

145
00:08:04.801 --> 00:08:08.204
It is also possible that he could have made a space of his own,

146
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:11.274
like an underground bunker or storage to hide the victims.

147
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:13.776
What should we do first?

148
00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:17.714
First, please gather information incidents in the past...

149
00:08:17.814 --> 00:08:20.383
or records that might concern the victims.

150
00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:23.419
At the same time, I need you to search nearby storages...

151
00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:26.022
or unused buildings in this town.

152
00:08:26.022 --> 00:08:28.024
We only have one day left...

153
00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:31.594
until the D-day that the culprit has set.

154
00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:33.062
Please hurry.

155
00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:37.200
Yes, Nana.

156
00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:39.569
I did some research on the land.

157
00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:43.339
It is hard to determine who owns it as it's in litigation.

158
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.109
But until last year, it belonged to Nam Taek Jin,

159
00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:48.978
Lee Yoo Jin's grandfather.

160
00:08:49.812 --> 00:08:52.348
There was an old shopping center on the land.

161
00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:53.750
But it was torn down last year.

162
00:08:54.384 --> 00:08:57.287
But during the process, there have been conflicts...

163
00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.122
with its tenants.

164
00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:02.392
Thank you. Then please find out more about the tenants.

165
00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:08.965
Sun Woo, Hye In's father has disappeared suddenly.

166
00:09:09.499 --> 00:09:11.968
- What? - After I explained the incident,

167
00:09:12.068 --> 00:09:13.570
he suddenly went out.

168
00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:17.440
Mr. Hong, we're doing our best. Please wait a little.

169
00:09:17.707 --> 00:09:20.209
That scumbag. I will kill you.

170
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.913
But before he went out, he said something strange.

171
00:09:24.547 --> 00:09:26.015
He said he'd kill someone.

172
00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:29.385
Does that mean he knows who the culprit is?

173
00:09:29.752 --> 00:09:31.454
Track his phone.

174
00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:34.791
I know that strange things have happened.

175
00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:39.562
But this is when you should get ahold of yourself.

176
00:09:40.563 --> 00:09:42.432
I know I shouldn't say this,

177
00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:47.470
but this could be a chance for you.

178
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:52.041
You should do your best, so that you can do more for the...

179
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.812
What are you doing?

180
00:09:55.812 --> 00:09:58.781
- Where is my daughter? - What?

181
00:09:58.781 --> 00:10:02.218
You pervert. Where did you hide them?

182
00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:04.454
- You scumbag! - Are you out of your mind?

183
00:10:04.454 --> 00:10:06.155
- You scumbag! - No!

184
00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:07.590
- You! - No!

185
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.429
Did you think I wouldn't know?

186
00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:16.065
I will kill you, you jerk.

187
00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:18.201
What is he even doing?

188
00:10:19.302 --> 00:10:21.738
Gosh, I will kill him. Gosh.

189
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.541
I am so thirsty.

190
00:10:28.578 --> 00:10:31.648
Why am I suddenly so sleepy?

191
00:10:34.183 --> 00:10:37.387
Yoo Jin. Yoo Jin, don't sleep.

192
00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:44.293
Do you remember when we ran in the race last year?

193
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:47.930
You caught up by 10m. We won in the end.

194
00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:51.334
That wasn't 10m.

195
00:10:52.502 --> 00:10:54.103
It was more than that.

196
00:10:55.038 --> 00:10:57.940
We called you Queen Yoo Jin.

197
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.179
What does that have to do with this?

198
00:11:04.113 --> 00:11:06.282
We're going to die out here anyway.

199
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.087
I don't know how you can be at peace when we are in such a bad situation.

200
00:11:11.387 --> 00:11:13.356
Hong Hye In, stop it.

201
00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:15.358
What's going to happen to us?

202
00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:18.795
Are we really going to die here?

203
00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.029
No.

204
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:22.799
If he's watching us,

205
00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:26.135
there must be a way to lure him.

206
00:11:26.502 --> 00:11:27.637
How?

207
00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:31.574
If I had known that, I wouldn't be here like this.

208
00:11:32.075 --> 00:11:35.278
Don't treat Yoo Jin like that. She's sick.

209
00:11:35.545 --> 00:11:38.081
Do you think I'm not?

210
00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:40.049
I feel like I'm dying.

211
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.485
Stop it, Hong Hye In.

212
00:11:42.485 --> 00:11:45.722
I hate whining people.

213
00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:50.159
There are people who whine all day, while others solve their problems.

214
00:11:51.194 --> 00:11:53.162
I'm so sick of you.

215
00:12:00.536 --> 00:12:03.439
Hye In is scaring me.

216
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.146
(Motel)

217
00:12:23.192 --> 00:12:24.227
Oh, my gosh.

218
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.377
The damaged bag...

219
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:44.180
was found in a place related to Lee Yoo Jin's parents.

220
00:12:44.747 --> 00:12:45.815
In that case,

221
00:12:46.883 --> 00:12:50.586
there must be a reason why the victims' clothes were found here.

222
00:12:50.987 --> 00:12:53.956
The culprit must be trying...

223
00:12:53.956 --> 00:12:56.926
to disclose the secrets of the people he seeks revenge against.

224
00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:01.330
Thank you for your service.

225
00:13:04.967 --> 00:13:06.469
Is there anyone...

226
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.838
who looks familiar to you?

227
00:13:11.974 --> 00:13:13.342
Oh, wait!

228
00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.512
This guy. I've seen him before.

229
00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:24.420
So...

230
00:13:25.021 --> 00:13:27.323
why did he do that?

231
00:13:27.523 --> 00:13:31.127
He suddenly attacked me like a dog in heat!

232
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:33.062
Goodness.

233
00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:36.699
I don't think you are in a position to say so.

234
00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:38.000
What?

235
00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:42.038
These are the pictures I found on your computer in your office.

236
00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:47.043
How did you...

237
00:13:47.844 --> 00:13:51.180
Did you search my computer without my permission?

238
00:13:51.314 --> 00:13:53.683
What did you do in the evening of the last Monday?

239
00:13:53.783 --> 00:13:56.819
Are you suspecting me?

240
00:13:57.353 --> 00:13:59.622
Just answer my questions.

241
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.158
I'm... That hurts.

242
00:14:03.492 --> 00:14:05.428
It's not me.

243
00:14:06.162 --> 00:14:07.730
You are driving me nuts now.

244
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:11.634
He just wanted my land.

245
00:14:13.903 --> 00:14:15.438
Why am I here?

246
00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:19.375
You seem to be very sure that the coach is the culprit.

247
00:14:19.976 --> 00:14:22.078
May I ask you why?

248
00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:23.646
It is him.

249
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.717
He is the only one in town...

250
00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:29.852
who can do such a dirty thing like that.

251
00:14:30.186 --> 00:14:31.787
What do you mean?

252
00:14:33.155 --> 00:14:34.257
He...

253
00:14:34.724 --> 00:14:36.692
was previously convicted of sexual assault.

254
00:14:38.327 --> 00:14:41.397
According to what we found, there's no such record.

255
00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:46.135
A few years ago, he almost got sued for assaulting someone.

256
00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.004
So I helped him get away with it.

257
00:14:48.437 --> 00:14:50.706
That's how he could keep his job.

258
00:14:51.707 --> 00:14:54.210
I shouldn't have done that.

259
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:58.481
But I never knew he was that ungrateful.

260
00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:03.052
I was stupid.

261
00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:08.758
How could I let him take care of my daughter?

262
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:19.335
On the day your daughter was kidnapped,

263
00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:22.571
the coach has a solid alibi.

264
00:15:23.906 --> 00:15:24.907
What?

265
00:15:25.775 --> 00:15:27.243
Is that true?

266
00:15:27.443 --> 00:15:29.812
You said you were gone for three days for fishing.

267
00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:31.514
I did.

268
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:33.749
Are you sure you were just fishing?

269
00:15:34.116 --> 00:15:36.819
What do you mean?

270
00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:40.089
We found the girls' tracksuits...

271
00:15:40.222 --> 00:15:42.291
in front of the motel near the fishing site.

272
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.801
Who were you with in the motel room?

273
00:15:54.503 --> 00:15:56.839
Tell me now. Who was it?

274
00:15:58.007 --> 00:15:59.375
Her name is Ahn Eun Jin.

275
00:15:59.976 --> 00:16:01.877
She is my customer.

276
00:16:02.878 --> 00:16:05.147
This is my private life.

277
00:16:05.147 --> 00:16:07.650
This has nothing to do with the case.

278
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:10.286
Please keep this a secret.

279
00:16:10.786 --> 00:16:13.456
It's for her sake too.

280
00:16:18.961 --> 00:16:22.264
We confirmed the girls' coach, Kim Heung Sik's alibi.

281
00:16:22.264 --> 00:16:23.632
At the estimated time of the disappearance,

282
00:16:23.632 --> 00:16:26.535
the coach was treated by some other parents.

283
00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:27.903
What's the result of the bloodstain analysis?

284
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:32.108
The bloodstains we got from the tracksuits are not the girls'.

285
00:16:32.108 --> 00:16:35.011
At the moment, we don't have a DNA match.

286
00:16:37.213 --> 00:16:38.447
What's the result?

287
00:16:38.981 --> 00:16:42.618
The police is searching around the suspicious area now.

288
00:16:42.618 --> 00:16:43.719
But we didn't hear anything yet.

289
00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:47.189
What should we do? We are really running out of time.

290
00:16:49.058 --> 00:16:51.961
The culprit is very careful and cautious.

291
00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:53.162
He planned out every detail.

292
00:16:53.295 --> 00:16:56.399
Those two look far different from that.

293
00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:59.201
We analyzed all past events related to the victims' family...

294
00:16:59.201 --> 00:17:00.803
to see if anything came up.

295
00:17:00.803 --> 00:17:03.339
But we couldn't find any suspects who had an obvious cause.

296
00:17:03.973 --> 00:17:05.307
But the culprit left a trace...

297
00:17:05.408 --> 00:17:09.145
at the place that has something to do with the girls' parents.

298
00:17:10.212 --> 00:17:13.983
What if we are heading in the wrong direction?

299
00:17:13.983 --> 00:17:15.885
That's not it.

300
00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:19.789
There must be something among the parents.

301
00:17:20.356 --> 00:17:22.158
If there's anything...

302
00:17:22.158 --> 00:17:24.860
that's common among the parents...

303
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.529
and if they know about it too,

304
00:17:27.063 --> 00:17:30.199
they wouldn't want to hide anything at this moment.

305
00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:34.170
We also just saw what Hye In's dad was like.

306
00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:35.938
That could be something really small.

307
00:17:35.938 --> 00:17:38.574
So small that they wouldn't even think about it...

308
00:17:39.241 --> 00:17:42.311
while it was something important to the culprits.

309
00:17:43.079 --> 00:17:44.880
Are the parents together now?

310
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.981
Yes.

311
00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:47.650
Squad Chief.

312
00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:51.454
Please reveal every information little by little.

313
00:17:51.454 --> 00:17:52.755
What? What does that mean?

314
00:17:52.755 --> 00:17:55.257
They must be doubting each other now.

315
00:17:56.692 --> 00:17:59.428
While thinking about saving their kids,

316
00:17:59.728 --> 00:18:03.165
they must be also nervous about the person who hates them.

317
00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.834
Those two thoughts are coexisting in their minds at the moment.

318
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.036
We've got to stimulate them psychologically.

319
00:18:07.036 --> 00:18:10.272
And find out what happened in the past.

320
00:18:10.773 --> 00:18:11.974
Yes, I understand.

321
00:18:12.408 --> 00:18:14.110
This is horrible.

322
00:18:15.578 --> 00:18:16.745
I'm aware of it.

323
00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:20.316
I'll just pretend like I didn't hear anything.

324
00:18:21.484 --> 00:18:23.052
Can't you see how serious she is?

325
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.022
We are going to become like her soon.

326
00:18:27.256 --> 00:18:29.024
It's a matter of time.

327
00:18:30.659 --> 00:18:33.429
There will be a way.

328
00:18:33.629 --> 00:18:34.730
Like what?

329
00:18:36.132 --> 00:18:38.167
Did you not realize anything after everything?

330
00:18:39.735 --> 00:18:42.037
But... I don't think so.

331
00:18:43.906 --> 00:18:47.109
I don't think I can't do that. I can't.

332
00:18:47.109 --> 00:18:49.011
Even though we don't do anything,

333
00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:52.381
Yoo Jin is going to die first.

334
00:18:52.848 --> 00:18:54.016
Look at her.

335
00:18:54.517 --> 00:18:56.385
She's almost dead.

336
00:18:59.622 --> 00:19:00.623
Just...

337
00:19:01.023 --> 00:19:03.959
think like we are saving some time.

338
00:19:04.426 --> 00:19:05.427
But...

339
00:19:06.862 --> 00:19:07.997
Don't do this.

340
00:19:08.664 --> 00:19:11.700
Song Yi. You have to be realistic now.

341
00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:13.335
She is going to die anyway.

342
00:19:13.802 --> 00:19:15.437
We don't have to die too.

343
00:19:16.071 --> 00:19:17.072
Don't you think so?

344
00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:18.340
But...

345
00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:21.010
you want to kill our friend to save our lives?

346
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.079
We are best friends.

347
00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:25.981
Do you think I want to do it?

348
00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.718
But if this goes on,

349
00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:32.454
we are all going to die.

350
00:19:33.489 --> 00:19:35.524
We don't have a choice.

351
00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:37.459
You know it too.

352
00:19:38.394 --> 00:19:39.461
What if...

353
00:19:40.062 --> 00:19:42.831
we still cannot go out even when we do what he told us to do?

354
00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:45.868
What if he is someone gone completely mad?

355
00:19:46.635 --> 00:19:49.939
What if he just wants to kill us one by one like this?

356
00:19:51.407 --> 00:19:53.108
Let's do what he told us to do first.

357
00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:54.443
That's the only way.

358
00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:58.414
Let's just tell him Yoo Jin's dead.

359
00:19:59.048 --> 00:20:01.083
He's been watching us.

360
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.785
He will find it out soon.

361
00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:05.621
If we provoke him, it will make things only worse.

362
00:20:06.889 --> 00:20:08.524
We'll just do what he told us.

363
00:20:09.558 --> 00:20:10.559
Right?

364
00:20:11.694 --> 00:20:12.861
But I can't.

365
00:20:12.861 --> 00:20:14.897
Are you not worried about your mom?

366
00:20:15.564 --> 00:20:17.633
Your mom's sick.

367
00:20:18.867 --> 00:20:19.935
Mom...

368
00:20:21.904 --> 00:20:23.672
I'm the only one she has.

369
00:20:25.341 --> 00:20:28.377
She won't be able to live without me.

370
00:20:32.214 --> 00:20:34.817
Let's go home, Song Yi.

371
00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:44.326
We don't have a choice, right?

372
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.328
This is the only option, right?

373
00:20:46.595 --> 00:20:49.565
You are right. This is our only chance.

374
00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:51.200
Just think that way.

375
00:20:53.135 --> 00:20:55.304
Yoo Jin is going to die anyway.

376
00:20:55.771 --> 00:20:58.073
We're just speeding it up, right?

377
00:20:58.073 --> 00:20:59.275
That's right.

378
00:21:05.814 --> 00:21:06.815
Sir.

379
00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.051
We made our decision.

380
00:21:10.586 --> 00:21:11.587
Hello?

381
00:21:33.609 --> 00:21:34.877
What's going on?

382
00:21:36.745 --> 00:21:37.913
Nothing.

383
00:21:39.515 --> 00:21:40.816
We will sort it out.

384
00:21:51.593 --> 00:21:52.828
My Song Yi...

385
00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:57.199
The competition she's spent years preparing for is in two days.

386
00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:00.969
What can she do?

387
00:22:02.638 --> 00:22:05.341
My poor baby.

388
00:22:07.009 --> 00:22:09.511
Hey, is the competition even important now?

389
00:22:09.645 --> 00:22:11.246
I can't believe you.

390
00:22:12.014 --> 00:22:15.484
Are you saying that money is more important than that?

391
00:22:15.484 --> 00:22:16.552
What did you say?

392
00:22:16.952 --> 00:22:18.320
What is she saying now?

393
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.988
Don't get bothered.

394
00:22:19.988 --> 00:22:22.224
That's all she got.

395
00:22:22.324 --> 00:22:24.793
I don't even know why Yoo Jin hangs out with those kids.

396
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.763
Are you talking about my daughter, Song Yi?

397
00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:29.398
Did we say something wrong?

398
00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:32.434
Before knowing Song Yi and Hye In, Yoo Jin was...

399
00:22:32.434 --> 00:22:35.137
Don't do this again.

400
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:42.044
Song Yi...

401
00:22:49.218 --> 00:22:50.319
Hey.

402
00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:53.389
Just say something.

403
00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:54.823
Leave him alone.

404
00:22:54.823 --> 00:22:56.425
For what?

405
00:22:56.492 --> 00:22:59.495
How come the tracksuits were found at such a filthy place?

406
00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:03.565
What did you do to cause such a situation?

407
00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:04.633
What?

408
00:23:05.167 --> 00:23:07.069
I know things are bad,

409
00:23:07.169 --> 00:23:11.039
but you should think about the things you are saying. Gosh.

410
00:23:11.073 --> 00:23:13.909
I should think about what I say? Do we need to save your face?

411
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:15.344
My daughter might die.

412
00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:18.247
Who's dying now? I should be the one to say that.

413
00:23:18.914 --> 00:23:21.650
How are you going to explain the fact...

414
00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.153
that their bags were found on your father-in-law's land?

415
00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:25.187
What?

416
00:23:25.187 --> 00:23:26.822
Are you blaming us?

417
00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:30.959
Maybe you are the ones hiding something.

418
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.367
I didn't want to say this, but don't you know that...

419
00:23:38.367 --> 00:23:40.702
many people left this town because of your father-in-law?

420
00:23:40.702 --> 00:23:43.205
What? Is that all you have to say?

421
00:23:43.405 --> 00:23:45.641
How can you talk to us like that?

422
00:23:45.641 --> 00:23:46.942
Stop it.

423
00:23:47.776 --> 00:23:51.313
They are starting to blame one another.

424
00:23:51.613 --> 00:23:54.049
That might be what the culprit really wants.

425
00:23:54.249 --> 00:23:57.920
He could be watching us and enjoying himself.

426
00:23:58.487 --> 00:24:00.122
We should stop them.

427
00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:01.957
Something might come up.

428
00:24:03.091 --> 00:24:04.226
We should...

429
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:07.496
We should wait a little longer.

430
00:24:58.847 --> 00:25:02.317
You ignore others just because you are a little rich.

431
00:25:02.618 --> 00:25:04.620
And you treated the tenants really badly.

432
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.955
People in this town are always talking badly about you.

433
00:25:07.623 --> 00:25:09.892
You guys seem like the only ones who do not hear them.

434
00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:12.961
Did you think that just because they act nicely in front of you,

435
00:25:13.295 --> 00:25:15.364
they really like you?

436
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:16.865
What?

437
00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:19.101
You scumbag.

438
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:20.135
Don't.

439
00:25:20.569 --> 00:25:22.371
Is that all you have to say?

440
00:25:22.571 --> 00:25:24.973
Well, you were the one who tried to flatter us...

441
00:25:24.973 --> 00:25:26.909
so that you could get something out of us.

442
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:28.577
Flatter you?

443
00:25:28.911 --> 00:25:30.546
You scumbag!

444
00:25:30.546 --> 00:25:31.847
- You! - Stop.

445
00:25:31.847 --> 00:25:33.515
Stop this at once.

446
00:26:00.175 --> 00:26:02.678
Fighting, blaming, and attacking one another...

447
00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:04.980
are the things that the culprit wants.

448
00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:07.816
The culprit knows you well.

449
00:26:08.584 --> 00:26:12.254
That is why he wants to attack you and disclose your secrets.

450
00:26:12.688 --> 00:26:13.722
That means...

451
00:26:14.456 --> 00:26:18.427
you must know who the culprit is.

452
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.499
Did you think that just because they act nicely in front of you,

453
00:26:24.766 --> 00:26:26.802
they really like you?

454
00:26:27.369 --> 00:26:28.370
What?

455
00:26:29.204 --> 00:26:30.539
You scumbag.

456
00:26:30.606 --> 00:26:32.240
- Don't. - Let me go.

457
00:26:32.641 --> 00:26:34.476
Is that all you have to say?

458
00:26:34.643 --> 00:26:37.045
Well, you were the one who tried to flatter us...

459
00:26:37.045 --> 00:26:38.947
so that you could get something out of us.

460
00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:42.951
Find out if Mr. Hong has taken a case...

461
00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:46.154
that concerns Yoo Jin's family's properties...

462
00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:48.557
in the last few years.

463
00:26:48.557 --> 00:26:49.891
Yes, sir.

464
00:27:14.616 --> 00:27:15.817
All right.

465
00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:18.320
What do we need to do?

466
00:27:18.787 --> 00:27:21.356
He must be connected to all of you.

467
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.726
Please think carefully if there are people...

468
00:27:24.926 --> 00:27:26.428
that you all know.

469
00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:28.597
It doesn't have to be a close friend.

470
00:27:29.231 --> 00:27:32.134
You could have met by chance or just passed him by.

471
00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:34.202
If not,

472
00:27:35.837 --> 00:27:38.440
it could be someone from long ago or something trivial...

473
00:27:38.573 --> 00:27:40.175
that you forgot about him.

474
00:27:42.611 --> 00:27:44.680
I do not think...

475
00:27:45.047 --> 00:27:48.417
that we did anything bad that would make someone want to kill us.

476
00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:52.888
Yes, Nana.

477
00:27:53.221 --> 00:27:56.858
Hyun Jun, Park Song Yi's phone was turned on again.

478
00:27:57.192 --> 00:27:58.927
- Where is she? - She...

479
00:27:59.194 --> 00:28:03.198
She is within 500m radius of Halleung Police Station.

480
00:28:14.209 --> 00:28:15.277
Team Manager Kang.

481
00:28:20.882 --> 00:28:22.451
Don't let the parents out.

482
00:28:22.751 --> 00:28:24.319
There are only two girls.

483
00:28:24.753 --> 00:28:26.655
Something must have happened.

484
00:28:26.855 --> 00:28:27.889
Yes.

485
00:28:34.129 --> 00:28:35.597
- What happened? - Wait.

486
00:28:35.597 --> 00:28:36.665
- Yoo Jin! - Hye In!

487
00:28:36.665 --> 00:28:38.934
- Hye In! - The case is not over.

488
00:28:38.934 --> 00:28:40.135
- Please wait. - Let us go.

489
00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:42.604
- Yoo Jin! - Is that Song Yi? Is it?

490
00:28:42.604 --> 00:28:43.805
- Song Yi! - Gosh.

491
00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:45.073
Let us go.

492
00:28:45.073 --> 00:28:46.341
Why aren't you letting us go?

493
00:28:46.341 --> 00:28:48.243
Song Yi! Is that Song Yi?

494
00:28:48.243 --> 00:28:49.711
- Song Yi! - Yoo Jin!

495
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:50.846
Please wait for a moment.

496
00:28:50.846 --> 00:28:51.880
Move!

497
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.482
Where is Hye In?

498
00:28:56.284 --> 00:28:58.053
Didn't Hye In make it?

499
00:29:24.312 --> 00:29:25.914
Where is Hong Hye In?

500
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.918
Did you...

501
00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:32.988
know who it was?

502
00:29:46.101 --> 00:29:49.671
You need to tell me about the situation you were in.

503
00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:07.622
Yoo Jin.

504
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:11.159
I know it'll be hard for you,

505
00:30:11.459 --> 00:30:13.695
but please tell me everything you remember.

506
00:30:15.697 --> 00:30:17.833
Where were you locked up?

507
00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:24.005
Is Hong Hye In still there?

508
00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:29.311
What happened there?

509
00:30:31.012 --> 00:30:33.048
There was nothing we could do.

510
00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:35.650
Nothing.

511
00:30:38.053 --> 00:30:42.991
You've been through something I could never imagine.

512
00:30:43.959 --> 00:30:45.827
Whatever happened there,

513
00:30:47.662 --> 00:30:49.898
it wasn't your fault.

514
00:30:52.667 --> 00:30:53.802
Really?

515
00:30:56.071 --> 00:30:57.973
Do you really think so?

516
00:31:09.651 --> 00:31:10.719
Choose...

517
00:31:14.256 --> 00:31:17.659
He made us choose.

518
00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:23.732
Song Yi is defending herself because of her fear.

519
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.735
Don't ask her about the incident.

520
00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:29.537
Start slowly with daily questions.

521
00:31:30.772 --> 00:31:31.773
Yes.

522
00:31:31.773 --> 00:31:33.174
Listen to me.

523
00:31:33.174 --> 00:31:34.643
- No. - What happened?

524
00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:35.777
- Why don't you tell us anything? - What's going on?

525
00:31:35.777 --> 00:31:37.312
- Are they all right? - Why don't you tell us anything?

526
00:31:37.312 --> 00:31:38.313
Why?

527
00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:39.948
- Wait. - Are the children safe?

528
00:31:39.948 --> 00:31:41.549
- Tell us. - It's driving me crazy.

529
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:43.551
- Tell us something. - Wait.

530
00:31:43.551 --> 00:31:44.719
Hey, wait.

531
00:31:44.719 --> 00:31:46.187
Gosh, wait.

532
00:31:46.187 --> 00:31:47.923
In the alley where...

533
00:31:47.956 --> 00:31:50.025
the girls were found, we found a car.

534
00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:53.328
We think it was used for the crime.

535
00:31:58.867 --> 00:32:00.535
- It's me. - Team Manager Kang.

536
00:32:00.535 --> 00:32:02.904
I found some law suits you wanted me to find.

537
00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:07.042
Hong Min Seok, Hye In's father, was in charge of...

538
00:32:07.242 --> 00:32:09.744
three law suits related to Yoo Jin's family's properties.

539
00:32:09.844 --> 00:32:13.315
But there's no one who could be associated to this case.

540
00:32:13.581 --> 00:32:15.750
These are just civil suits.

541
00:32:16.418 --> 00:32:18.753
I'll send you the list of people involved in the case.

542
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.155
Okay.

543
00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:28.196
These don't seem like the right motive for this kind of crime.

544
00:32:28.463 --> 00:32:31.566
It says here that Lee Yoo Jin's parents lost these two cases.

545
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.170
It's hard to find connections to these law suits with Song Yi's mom.

546
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.107
But there must have been a reason for the culprit...

547
00:32:39.374 --> 00:32:41.176
to have targeted these three.

548
00:32:43.578 --> 00:32:47.349
It specifically mentions that she will come back on Friday night.

549
00:32:47.349 --> 00:32:49.384
(I will come back by Friday night. Don't worry.)

550
00:32:49.384 --> 00:32:51.820
It has been repeatedly mentioned,

551
00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.557
which means that day has a meaning to the culprit.

552
00:32:56.558 --> 00:32:58.526
Unlike what we thought, the culprit...

553
00:32:58.593 --> 00:33:00.095
released two people early.

554
00:33:00.695 --> 00:33:02.664
We don't know whether one of them is alive or dead.

555
00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:06.534
What could that mean?

556
00:33:06.735 --> 00:33:08.203
Some culprits...

557
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:10.772
expose themselves on purpose.

558
00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:12.674
They want the police or other people...

559
00:33:13.475 --> 00:33:15.310
to recognize them.

560
00:33:16.444 --> 00:33:18.313
Please take Song Yi's mother home.

561
00:33:22.183 --> 00:33:24.419
Do you know anyone here?

562
00:33:26.287 --> 00:33:28.857
Yes, I know a couple.

563
00:33:28.923 --> 00:33:31.259
We live in a very small neighborhood.

564
00:33:31.526 --> 00:33:33.561
Is there anyone here...

565
00:33:33.628 --> 00:33:35.663
who has a connection to you?

566
00:33:35.897 --> 00:33:36.898
Perhaps...

567
00:33:37.532 --> 00:33:40.001
someone whom you had a problem with.

568
00:33:40.635 --> 00:33:41.770
No.

569
00:33:47.642 --> 00:33:48.943
Yes, just a moment.

570
00:33:50.879 --> 00:33:53.181
Team Manager Kang, I found something.

571
00:33:53.681 --> 00:33:57.085
I looked up cases where the charges were dropped,

572
00:33:57.385 --> 00:34:00.555
and I found a person who sued and then dropped charges few years back.

573
00:34:01.356 --> 00:34:02.724
It's Ji Soo Chul, 52 years old.

574
00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:04.325
I looked up his address back then,

575
00:34:04.325 --> 00:34:06.261
and it was 54 Hannam-dong.

576
00:34:06.261 --> 00:34:07.362
Where is that?

577
00:34:07.562 --> 00:34:09.631
It's the empty lot where the girls' backpacks were found.

578
00:34:09.697 --> 00:34:11.166
A few buildings...

579
00:34:11.166 --> 00:34:14.102
were demolished there, and that's the location.

580
00:34:14.436 --> 00:34:17.172
Besides, Ji Soo Chul has a daughter.

581
00:34:17.472 --> 00:34:20.408
And she was in the sports team in the girls' high school.

582
00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:22.410
What's his current home address and where does he work?

583
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:24.245
His address is in the other city.

584
00:34:25.213 --> 00:34:27.916
There are records of him working at a distribution center here.

585
00:34:27.916 --> 00:34:30.051
But it says he quit.

586
00:34:31.052 --> 00:34:32.620
I'll send the information to you now.

587
00:34:33.054 --> 00:34:34.122
Good work.

588
00:34:36.691 --> 00:34:37.926
(Ji Soo Chul)

589
00:34:39.127 --> 00:34:40.361
Do you know him?

590
00:34:40.695 --> 00:34:41.763
Yes.

591
00:34:42.263 --> 00:34:43.965
It's Yeon Hee's father.

592
00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:47.135
They lived in this neighborhood, but they moved a few years ago.

593
00:34:47.368 --> 00:34:48.937
Do you remember anything...

594
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:51.306
about him?

595
00:34:51.773 --> 00:34:53.475
Nothing special.

596
00:34:53.975 --> 00:34:56.578
Goodness. It's not him.

597
00:34:56.911 --> 00:34:59.581
He's such a gentle and nice man.

598
00:35:00.215 --> 00:35:03.918
Everyone always said that he'd live fine without the law.

599
00:35:07.021 --> 00:35:08.022
What's wrong?

600
00:35:08.923 --> 00:35:10.525
Do you remember something?

601
00:35:11.593 --> 00:35:14.662
Yes, I just remembered.

602
00:35:14.963 --> 00:35:17.699
You did such a poor job managing this place.

603
00:35:17.765 --> 00:35:19.234
Please, Yoo Jin's father...

604
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.369
consider our situation.

605
00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:23.404
The sewage back flowed.

606
00:35:23.404 --> 00:35:25.173
How can you have us fix it?

607
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.209
You know our situation.

608
00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.212
We haven't been able to open for business for weeks.

609
00:35:31.212 --> 00:35:33.648
Is that our fault?

610
00:35:34.315 --> 00:35:36.484
No, that's not what I mean.

611
00:35:36.484 --> 00:35:38.786
Do you know how many chances I gave you...

612
00:35:38.786 --> 00:35:40.788
because both our daughters are in the sports team?

613
00:35:41.189 --> 00:35:44.526
Do you know how many months of rent you're backed up on?

614
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.829
If you don't want to fix it, just leave.

615
00:35:48.463 --> 00:35:49.464
Excuse me?

616
00:35:49.864 --> 00:35:52.934
Please, I beg of you. You know how we live.

617
00:35:52.934 --> 00:35:55.036
Please give me more time.

618
00:35:55.603 --> 00:35:57.505
- Miss. - Where are you touching?

619
00:35:57.505 --> 00:35:59.807
- Please. I'm sorry. - Goodness!

620
00:35:59.807 --> 00:36:00.942
This is so annoying.

621
00:36:00.942 --> 00:36:04.112
Goodness. This is pathetic.

622
00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:09.884
Why are you doing that to my dad?

623
00:36:10.151 --> 00:36:12.353
What did he do wrong?

624
00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.056
How dare you look at me like that, you little girl?

625
00:36:15.757 --> 00:36:16.758
Oh, no.

626
00:36:19.327 --> 00:36:20.328
I'm sorry.

627
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:23.965
Yeon Hee.

628
00:36:24.566 --> 00:36:27.302
And so? What happened afterwards?

629
00:36:28.102 --> 00:36:29.270
He asked me...

630
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:32.240
to be a witness.

631
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:34.709
And you refused that?

632
00:36:37.378 --> 00:36:40.481
I see them every day in this tiny neighborhood.

633
00:36:41.382 --> 00:36:43.351
I didn't want confrontation.

634
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:50.992
Find out where Ji Soo Chul is now.

635
00:36:51.059 --> 00:36:53.294
And see if he has a place to lock up the victims.

636
00:36:53.361 --> 00:36:55.630
Yes, I'm on it.

637
00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:01.970
Song Yi,

638
00:37:02.837 --> 00:37:05.807
I heard you were a runner until you were in middle school?

639
00:37:08.142 --> 00:37:10.278
I was in the running team in middle school too.

640
00:37:12.013 --> 00:37:13.881
I woke up early every morning...

641
00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:17.285
and ran 10 laps every morning.

642
00:37:17.752 --> 00:37:18.786
Right?

643
00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:21.623
Your mom told me.

644
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.193
You were good at every kind of sport,

645
00:37:25.393 --> 00:37:27.228
not just running.

646
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.531
But she made you swim...

647
00:37:30.598 --> 00:37:32.100
because she didn't want you to get tanned.

648
00:37:39.274 --> 00:37:42.443
Your mom was here for two days...

649
00:37:42.443 --> 00:37:43.845
without getting any sleep.

650
00:37:45.346 --> 00:37:46.948
She couldn't even eat.

651
00:37:47.815 --> 00:37:49.484
She said she wouldn't do anything...

652
00:37:50.318 --> 00:37:51.986
until she found you.

653
00:37:54.722 --> 00:37:55.857
So,

654
00:37:57.892 --> 00:38:01.562
can you tell me what happened now?

655
00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:06.968
It was so cold.

656
00:38:08.303 --> 00:38:09.804
I was so thirsty.

657
00:38:11.639 --> 00:38:12.640
And...

658
00:38:13.908 --> 00:38:15.943
I was so hungry.

659
00:38:18.613 --> 00:38:19.647
You want to...

660
00:38:20.214 --> 00:38:21.849
to use this?

661
00:38:21.949 --> 00:38:23.284
Don't get weak.

662
00:38:24.852 --> 00:38:27.922
This is the only way we can get out of here.

663
00:38:29.057 --> 00:38:31.959
No, I can't do it.

664
00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.862
You can't be like that. We already decided.

665
00:38:36.497 --> 00:38:39.167
No, I don't think I can do it.

666
00:38:39.367 --> 00:38:41.969
Song Yi, look at me.

667
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:45.773
This is an extreme situation.

668
00:38:47.442 --> 00:38:48.943
It's just like...

669
00:38:49.277 --> 00:38:52.680
those athletes who fell from the Andes Mountains in the movie.

670
00:38:52.947 --> 00:38:55.383
They got cold and hungry,

671
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.919
so they ended up eating their friend.

672
00:38:58.586 --> 00:39:00.621
Were they murderers from the beginning?

673
00:39:02.223 --> 00:39:03.391
No, they weren't.

674
00:39:04.592 --> 00:39:07.061
They were good people.

675
00:39:07.195 --> 00:39:10.331
The situation made them that way.

676
00:39:10.398 --> 00:39:12.633
They had no choice,

677
00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:14.435
just like us!

678
00:39:27.215 --> 00:39:30.618
So you killed her?

679
00:39:38.726 --> 00:39:41.763
I had no choice.

680
00:39:43.064 --> 00:39:46.567
If I hadn't, I would have died.

681
00:39:50.905 --> 00:39:51.939
Should I...

682
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.742
just have died?

683
00:40:00.014 --> 00:40:01.182
What do I do?

684
00:40:03.384 --> 00:40:06.487
What happens to me now?

685
00:40:13.094 --> 00:40:14.095
Yoo Jin,

686
00:40:15.029 --> 00:40:16.164
look here.

687
00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.409
Four years ago, Ji Soo Chul's daughter Ji Yeon Hee...

688
00:40:28.409 --> 00:40:31.512
was a swimmer good enough to be featured in the local papers.

689
00:40:32.013 --> 00:40:34.182
She failed to attend an important competition.

690
00:40:34.248 --> 00:40:36.250
Afterwards, she repeatedly received physical therapy.

691
00:40:36.451 --> 00:40:38.853
But in the end, she had to quit sports.

692
00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.856
That competition was on a Friday.

693
00:40:47.094 --> 00:40:51.065
It's where they stored pomegranates, this area's specialty.

694
00:40:51.132 --> 00:40:52.867
It's been years since it closed...

695
00:40:52.867 --> 00:40:54.735
ever since harvest's been low.

696
00:41:11.486 --> 00:41:12.520
Just a moment.

697
00:41:20.928 --> 00:41:23.297
Ji Soo Chul, get up.

698
00:41:27.869 --> 00:41:28.870
I...

699
00:41:30.037 --> 00:41:32.273
didn't do anything to her.

700
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:34.876
I told you to get up.

701
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.879
I didn't even come down here.

702
00:41:40.348 --> 00:41:42.183
You must have heard already,

703
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:45.686
but it's all their doing.

704
00:41:47.955 --> 00:41:49.624
All I did...

705
00:41:50.658 --> 00:41:54.295
was telling the world what kind of people they are.

706
00:42:01.035 --> 00:42:02.069
In the end,

707
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:06.440
they were no different from their parents.

708
00:42:30.264 --> 00:42:31.299
Miss.

709
00:42:31.799 --> 00:42:33.601
You saw it that day.

710
00:42:33.768 --> 00:42:36.370
Yoo Jin's father pushed Yeon Hee.

711
00:42:37.338 --> 00:42:41.542
But Hye In's father came to me and said Yeon Hee started the fight,

712
00:42:41.542 --> 00:42:43.878
and it's no use suing him.

713
00:42:43.878 --> 00:42:45.346
Does that make sense to you?

714
00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.683
Please help me.

715
00:42:49.317 --> 00:42:51.752
This is too unfair.

716
00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.923
Yeon Hee might not be able to do sports now.

717
00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:59.360
What am I going to do with my poor girl?

718
00:43:00.761 --> 00:43:03.598
Yeon Hee's Song Yi's friend.

719
00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:05.399
Here you go.

720
00:43:06.701 --> 00:43:07.902
Take care.

721
00:43:30.958 --> 00:43:32.893
No, that's not what I did.

722
00:43:33.461 --> 00:43:34.862
That's amazing.

723
00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:35.997
See, I told you.

724
00:43:35.997 --> 00:43:37.331
Goodness.

725
00:43:45.773 --> 00:43:46.874
Arrest him.

726
00:44:08.429 --> 00:44:09.664
Look.

727
00:44:10.464 --> 00:44:14.635
Even young girls like that killed their friend to live.

728
00:44:15.102 --> 00:44:16.771
That's what humans are.

729
00:44:16.937 --> 00:44:18.839
We're all selfish beings.

730
00:44:19.006 --> 00:44:23.044
No one cares even when a person's life is completely ruined.

731
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.043
I do feel sorry for that little girl, Yeon Hee,

732
00:44:56.243 --> 00:44:58.279
but all I did was legal.

733
00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.715
Making him drop charges?

734
00:45:01.215 --> 00:45:03.384
It was all for Yeon Hee's father.

735
00:45:04.518 --> 00:45:06.620
Why continue a case that's sure to lose?

736
00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:10.424
But what does that have to do with this?

737
00:45:10.991 --> 00:45:14.061
Did you find my Hye In?

738
00:45:15.496 --> 00:45:19.633
No, that was just a simple accident.

739
00:45:20.267 --> 00:45:23.604
Who knew she'd barge in like that?

740
00:45:23.738 --> 00:45:25.673
We suffered a lot of losses too.

741
00:45:26.874 --> 00:45:29.977
I felt quite bothered,

742
00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:33.414
so that's why I let him not pay me the two months' worth of rent.

743
00:45:34.415 --> 00:45:38.586
But why are you asking me this useless story?

744
00:45:39.153 --> 00:45:41.956
And why aren't you letting my Yoo Jin out?

745
00:45:42.256 --> 00:45:45.426
I hope you're not asking any weird questions to her!

746
00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:47.161
I did see Yoo Jin's father...

747
00:45:47.928 --> 00:45:50.164
push Yeon Hee.

748
00:45:53.267 --> 00:45:54.268
At first,

749
00:45:55.469 --> 00:45:57.304
I was worried...

750
00:45:57.905 --> 00:46:00.407
things would get uncomfortable if I get involved.

751
00:46:01.909 --> 00:46:04.578
To be honest, this is what I thought later on.

752
00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:09.283
Without Yeon Hee,

753
00:46:11.152 --> 00:46:14.655
my Song Yi would be able to enter the competition.

754
00:46:19.293 --> 00:46:21.896
A small hole sinks a ship.

755
00:46:22.496 --> 00:46:25.599
And a small crime destroys people.

(National Criminal Investigation)

758
00:46:35.276 --> 00:46:38.946
Everyone, how do you all feel...

759
00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:43.150
about a much needed hangout session tomorrow afternoon?

760
00:46:44.318 --> 00:46:46.153
I have to visit my mom tomorrow.

761
00:46:48.455 --> 00:46:50.591
I'm sorry. I have a press conference in the morning.

762
00:46:51.725 --> 00:46:53.027
Then Hyun Jun, we can...

763
00:46:53.027 --> 00:46:54.728
I'm sorry, but I already have plans.

764
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:14.949
What am I doing...

765
00:47:15.749 --> 00:47:17.184
when I'm 30 already?

766
00:47:18.752 --> 00:47:22.189
Who cares! I can eat, drink, and live alone!

767
00:47:22.489 --> 00:47:24.992
Everyone is alone in life.

768
00:47:30.664 --> 00:47:33.801
Hey, beautiful lady drinking cocktails.

769
00:47:34.668 --> 00:47:37.571
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

770

- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

773
00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:50.117
Happy birthday.

774
00:47:51.352 --> 00:47:54.288
Blow the candles, and then you'll get your gift.

775
00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:55.389
Really?

776
00:47:55.856 --> 00:47:57.558
I'm sorry for being late.

777
00:47:57.925 --> 00:48:01.328
A very nice man wanted me to give this to you.

778
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.935
Have I told you this?

779
00:48:08.135 --> 00:48:10.271
I'm always thankful.

780
00:48:10.437 --> 00:48:12.606
Happy birthday. Don't ever forget.

781
00:48:12.973 --> 00:48:15.009
Kang Ki Hyung is always behind your back.

782

(Seoul)

786
00:49:31.185 --> 00:49:33.253
Did you watch the soccer match yesterday?

787
00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:37.291
They should select players based on how well they play.

788
00:49:37.291 --> 00:49:39.026
But right now, it's all through connections.

789
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.864
Korean soccer is done for unless they completely switch it up.

790
00:49:44.164 --> 00:49:46.166
I still had a bit of hope for yesterday's match, but...

791
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.702
the coach wanted to switch strategies.

792
00:49:49.136 --> 00:49:51.405
They failed in controlling and passing the ball in the first half.

793
00:49:51.405 --> 00:49:53.741
No need to even mention their shooting.

794
00:50:00.514 --> 00:50:01.882

We're here.

What do you want to see here?

803
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.529
You have to take the elevator there...

804

(Vacant)

809
00:51:09.283 --> 00:51:10.918
Lee Hyun Jae. 41 years old.

810
00:51:11.218 --> 00:51:12.653
He was found murdered...

811
00:51:12.653 --> 00:51:15.255
in his taxi under Guwol Bridge early this morning.

812
00:51:15.456 --> 00:51:18.759
A deep cut from a sharp tool was found on his neck.

813
00:51:18.759 --> 00:51:21.428
He died from the excessive bleeding.

814
00:51:22.696 --> 00:51:24.498
There was an anomaly.

815
00:51:25.365 --> 00:51:29.770
There's a rock embedded deep in his ears.

816
00:51:30.304 --> 00:51:33.674
If you look closely, you can see that the handle is broken.

817
00:51:34.408 --> 00:51:37.377
It looks like he attached a handle to a rock and rammed it down.

818
00:51:37.845 --> 00:51:39.580
Is it like an arrowhead?

819
00:51:39.847 --> 00:51:42.149
He ground a rock to make it into a blade,

820
00:51:42.282 --> 00:51:45.119
and broke the handle, so that he could stab...

821
00:51:45.486 --> 00:51:46.987
deep into the victim's brain.

822
00:51:47.221 --> 00:51:48.755
Another abnormality...

823
00:51:48.755 --> 00:51:51.925
is that the victim's eyes were covered.

824
00:51:51.992 --> 00:51:53.560
If his eyes were covered,

825
00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.896
it means the suspect felt guilty.

826
00:51:55.996 --> 00:52:00.267
That depends on whether he covered them after or before the murder.

(National Criminal Investigation)

828

She was found a week ago in her studio apartment in Hanseo-gu.

832
00:52:15.816 --> 00:52:18.152
And this is a dentist, Kang Joon Suk, 30 years old.

833
00:52:18.285 --> 00:52:20.020
He was found 10 days ago.

834
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.688
The police found him in the kitchen...

835
00:52:21.688 --> 00:52:24.725
of his vacation home in Hupyeong two weeks after his death.

836
00:52:24.892 --> 00:52:27.227
Considering the murder method and pattern,

837
00:52:27.728 --> 00:52:29.062
one person did all this.

838
00:52:29.463 --> 00:52:31.131
The locations are different,

839
00:52:31.198 --> 00:52:33.467
and the victims have no relation with one another.

840
00:52:33.767 --> 00:52:36.370
There's a unique murder pattern found here.

841
00:52:36.503 --> 00:52:39.006
The local police determined that the murders would continue...

842
00:52:39.006 --> 00:52:40.774
and passed the case along to us.

843
00:52:41.441 --> 00:52:43.777
The local station didn't find any other clues?

844
00:52:44.044 --> 00:52:46.180
You'll see once you read the initial investigation report,

845
00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:48.315
but the suspect is practically a ghost.

846
00:52:48.382 --> 00:52:50.284
The murders occur in the middle of the night,

847
00:52:50.284 --> 00:52:51.652
so there is no witness.

848
00:52:51.718 --> 00:52:53.487
And none of the security cameras...

849
00:52:53.487 --> 00:52:57.291
near the scene picked up any suspicious activity.

850
00:52:57.324 --> 00:53:01.128
And the police has made all details private,

851
00:53:01.128 --> 00:53:02.396
so thankfully,

852
00:53:02.396 --> 00:53:05.832
the media hasn't figured out the connection among the three cases.

853
00:53:05.899 --> 00:53:07.234
This won't be easy.

854
00:53:07.534 --> 00:53:09.403
Profiling a murderer...

855
00:53:09.403 --> 00:53:12.573
who kills people without a set criteria...

856
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.841
is extremely difficult.

857
00:53:15.375 --> 00:53:18.745
Sun Woo and Hyun Jun, go visit the victims' homes.

858
00:53:18.879 --> 00:53:20.480
We'll meet up at the local station.

859
00:53:20.547 --> 00:53:21.548
Yes, sir.

860
00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:26.320
With murder patterns that exhibit an aggressive tendency,

861
00:53:26.386 --> 00:53:29.356
the killer is usually a man in his 20s to 30s.

862
00:53:29.489 --> 00:53:30.824
The murder spots were deserted,

863
00:53:30.824 --> 00:53:33.327
but he committed murder in the middle of downtown.

864
00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.562
He didn't leave a single trace,

865
00:53:36.163 --> 00:53:38.065
meaning he's highly intelligent.

866
00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.202
Yes, the murders seem spontaneous,

867
00:53:42.202 --> 00:53:44.104
but they're actually meticulously planned.

868
00:53:45.372 --> 00:53:47.341
The murderer carried a weapon around.

869
00:53:47.808 --> 00:53:49.943
And he used the same murder weapon...

870
00:53:50.077 --> 00:53:52.346
in the same way for all the murders.

871
00:53:55.015 --> 00:53:56.950
The fact that the murderer covered the victim's eyes...

872
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:58.752
means two things.

873
00:53:59.186 --> 00:54:01.421
Either the murderer is unsure of his deed,

874
00:54:01.488 --> 00:54:03.724
or he wants to hide his identity.

875
00:54:03.857 --> 00:54:06.126
I'm sure it's the victim who drove the taxi.

876
00:54:06.193 --> 00:54:07.294
Even in the initial investigation,

877
00:54:07.294 --> 00:54:10.731
they didn't find any of the killer's fingerprints in the car.

878
00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:42.696
(Vacant)

879
00:54:48.902 --> 00:54:50.871
The murderer didn't want...

880
00:54:50.871 --> 00:54:53.907
the victim to see him when he was killing him.

881
00:54:54.374 --> 00:54:56.843
He covered the victim's eyes after the murder,

882
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.146
meaning he felt guilty.

883
00:55:00.147 --> 00:55:02.716
Only the express train goes to Guwol Station past midnight.

884
00:55:03.016 --> 00:55:04.918
And the train doesn't stop at all...

885
00:55:05.152 --> 00:55:06.720
early in the morning when the victim was killed.

886
00:55:12.459 --> 00:55:14.928
Records say that his last passenger...

887
00:55:14.928 --> 00:55:16.863
was picked up at Youngsan-dong.

888
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:20.434
Youngsan-dong is a gate area to enter Seoul from West Gyeonggi.

889
00:55:21.435 --> 00:55:24.705
There's a famous driver restaurant street over there.

890
00:55:24.938 --> 00:55:26.340
Drivers always stop by for a meal...

891
00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.676
before their night shift begins.

892
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:35.282
Then that explains how the murderer...

893
00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:36.483
picked the taxi.

894
00:55:36.483 --> 00:55:38.985
He meticulously prepared and planned this.

895
00:55:50.197 --> 00:55:52.265
His neck was sliced here.

896
00:56:05.112 --> 00:56:07.247
And the stone axe was rammed into his ear here.

897
00:56:15.355 --> 00:56:17.991
I'm sure at first, Han Ju Young tried to run,

898
00:56:33.106 --> 00:56:34.374
but she was caught right away.

899
00:56:35.675 --> 00:56:37.110
And she fell here.

900
00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:54.294
He must have known the victim would die soon.

901
00:56:54.628 --> 00:56:56.496
Why do you think he bothered to stab the ears...

902
00:56:56.496 --> 00:56:57.931
and break the blade?

903
00:56:58.064 --> 00:56:59.800
There are a couple possibilities.

904
00:56:59.866 --> 00:57:01.868
First, if you stab the ears,

905
00:57:01.868 --> 00:57:05.138
the blade can penetrate the brain in the fastest time.

906
00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:07.174
The murderer must have intended...

907
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.477
to kill the girl in the most certain way.

908
00:57:10.544 --> 00:57:11.611
It must be a compulsion.

909
00:57:13.346 --> 00:57:14.815
He attempts the murder again...

910
00:57:14.881 --> 00:57:17.017
until he can be sure...

911
00:57:17.017 --> 00:57:18.652
that the victim is dead.

912
00:57:19.453 --> 00:57:21.254
Breaking the handle...

913
00:57:21.254 --> 00:57:23.723
occurs from time to time in prison stab cases.

914
00:57:24.024 --> 00:57:25.625
Once the handle is broken,

915
00:57:25.692 --> 00:57:27.561
the opponent, who's already drained,

916
00:57:27.627 --> 00:57:30.197
can't pull out the knife that's been deeply penetrated.

917
00:57:30.597 --> 00:57:33.099
You mentioned there might be a couple of possibilities.

918
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.701
What's the other one?

919
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:44.144
Two famous serial killers in the US, Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris,

920
00:57:44.211 --> 00:57:46.746
stabbed an ice pick on the victims' brains...

921
00:57:46.746 --> 00:57:48.315
and broke the handle.

922
00:57:48.849 --> 00:57:52.252
Afterwards, there have been a couple of similar copycat murders.

923
00:57:52.319 --> 00:57:53.620
Then are you saying...

924
00:57:53.687 --> 00:57:56.690
he's imitating a foreign serial killer right now?

925
00:57:56.756 --> 00:57:58.458
We can't say yet.

926
00:57:59.059 --> 00:58:01.828
What we do know is that the killer...

927
00:58:01.895 --> 00:58:04.531
has a complex profile.

928
00:58:04.598 --> 00:58:05.665
Excuse me,

929
00:58:06.433 --> 00:58:08.635
but does profiling really work?

930
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:14.107
Profiling is only the beginning to cut down the list of suspects.

931
00:58:14.174 --> 00:58:17.744
For example, if the killer stabbed the victim first,

932
00:58:17.911 --> 00:58:19.346
it means he wanted to...

933
00:58:19.346 --> 00:58:21.915
control the situation quicker and more efficiently.

934
00:58:22.048 --> 00:58:23.483
The killer probably thought...

935
00:58:23.583 --> 00:58:26.653
he couldn't control the victims with strength.

936
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:30.490
The easiest mistake to make when considering horrendous murders...

937
00:58:30.924 --> 00:58:34.694
is concluding that the killer is a strong, muscular man.

938
00:58:34.761 --> 00:58:36.963
Profiling refutes such errors...

939
00:58:36.963 --> 00:58:38.365
and opens up new possibilities.

940
00:58:38.365 --> 00:58:39.599
To put it simply,

941
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:41.835
the killer likely has physical problems,

942
00:58:41.835 --> 00:58:43.603
is small-built,

943
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:46.740
and lacks confidence.

944
00:58:46.806 --> 00:58:47.974
So,

945
00:58:48.475 --> 00:58:49.976
what's the conclusion of your profiling?

946
00:58:49.976 --> 00:58:53.680
Detective Kim, he was speaking.

947
00:58:53.713 --> 00:58:54.915
No, it's okay.

948
00:58:55.315 --> 00:58:56.883
Of course you are frustrated.

949
00:58:56.883 --> 00:58:59.019
Deducing the culprit with profiling...

950
00:58:59.019 --> 00:59:01.087
requires a lot of time.

951
00:59:01.154 --> 00:59:04.391
But I am sure of this. This murder...

952
00:59:04.457 --> 00:59:07.394
was meticulously planned and controlled.

953
00:59:07.394 --> 00:59:08.662
Considering the murder pattern,

954
00:59:08.662 --> 00:59:10.864
the killer is too tightly controlled.

955
00:59:11.097 --> 00:59:14.134
Considering the pattern the killer has shown us,

956
00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:17.070
you can tell it's like an execution...

957
00:59:17.137 --> 00:59:18.705
for the victims.

958
00:59:22.475 --> 00:59:25.912
Usually, the marks that appear in these serial murder cases...

959
00:59:25.912 --> 00:59:28.548
are a unique signature that no one can copy.

960
00:59:28.915 --> 00:59:33.086
In that sense, the culprit we are looking for commits murders...

961
00:59:33.119 --> 00:59:36.189
because he wants to satisfy the inner desire when committing murder.

962
00:59:36.189 --> 00:59:39.359
And the murders will continue until your fantasies are shattered.

963
00:59:39.426 --> 00:59:41.027
In other words, the culprit...

964
00:59:41.027 --> 00:59:44.397
won't stop murdering others until he's arrested.

965
00:59:45.765 --> 00:59:48.368
From now on, the details we find at the murder scene...

966
00:59:48.368 --> 00:59:50.203
must be kept as absolute secrets.

967
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:53.607
From this point on, we'll establish Urgent Investigations HQ in the NCI.

968
00:59:54.274 --> 00:59:56.810
I ask for your cooperation to find the killer as soon as possible.

969
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:57.911
Okay.

970
00:59:57.911 --> 01:00:00.680
If we've profiled correctly,

971
01:00:00.747 --> 01:00:03.249
the murderer will be feared much more...

972
01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:05.518
than your average serial killer story.

973
01:00:28.174 --> 01:00:30.276
The culprit apparently killed another person tonight.

974
01:00:31.945 --> 01:00:33.580
- Get out! - Stop!

975
01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:35.682
He confessed to his murders.

976
01:00:35.815 --> 01:00:38.752
This world is filled with people who don't deserve life.

977
01:00:38.752 --> 01:00:40.887
The police can't restore justice again,

978
01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:42.822
so they're doing things on the side and seeming more suspicious.

979
01:00:43.957 --> 01:00:46.159
You mean the murder suspect will become a hero?

980
01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:47.827
Interpreting shorthand?

981
01:00:47.827 --> 01:00:48.962
The judge is inside,

982
01:00:48.962 --> 01:00:51.297
and he knows the details of the cases.

983
01:00:52.966 --> 01:00:55.368
He must know that we're after him.

984
01:00:55.368 --> 01:00:57.737
There has to be another answer in here.
