1
00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:08.336
I'm going to give up on piano and everything else.

2
00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:09.666
I don't need his help.

3
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:13.236
I'm okay. I'm really okay, so don't give up on piano.

4
00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:16.677
I'll go talk to the prosecutor tomorrow and try everything I can.

5
00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:18.346
Please stop begging!

6
00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:23.317
Hong Joo.

7
00:00:23.687 --> 00:00:27.857
Oh, no. Hong Joo, what do we do?

8
00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:30.587
Oh, no. What am I supposed to do?

9
00:00:30.587 --> 00:00:32.227
What do we do?

10
00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:35.997
No!

11
00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:40.206
(Episode 7)

12
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.137
Hey.

13
00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:44.706
Someone repeatedly appears in my dream.

14
00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:46.607
How should I interpret this?

15
00:00:47.077 --> 00:00:49.546
There's only one way to explain that. It's love sickness.

16
00:00:51.247 --> 00:00:52.417
Who is the girl?

17
00:00:56.747 --> 00:00:58.387
Seung Won. Seung Won!

18
00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:02.527
It's not a girl. It's mostly a man.

19
00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:06.327
Is... Is that what you like?

20
00:01:06.327 --> 00:01:07.327
What do you mean?

21
00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:12.837
No, it's not like what you think.

22
00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:14.506
Is that so?

23
00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:17.367
Then why does the man keep appearing in your dream?

24
00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:18.406
I don't know.

25
00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.006
But do you know what's more absurd?

26
00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:24.316
What is it?

27
00:01:24.676 --> 00:01:28.687
I feel like the dream will really come true.

28
00:01:29.587 --> 00:01:31.717
Have you gone mad?

29
00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:35.457
Maybe you're not feeling so well.

30
00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:37.596
I'll treat you some meat later.

31
00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:39.427
Let's go have pork belly meat.

32
00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:44.997
It's okay.

33
00:01:45.997 --> 00:01:48.737
I feel like I'm going to meet someone.

34
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.707
You feel like?

35
00:01:56.647 --> 00:01:57.677
I'm curious.

36
00:01:58.277 --> 00:02:00.277
I'm curious of one little detail I changed.

37
00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:02.647
Will that little detail...

38
00:02:03.517 --> 00:02:05.786
be able to prevent something horrible...

39
00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.487
that's going to happen soon?

40
00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:26.036
Don't worry so much.

41
00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:30.707
I didn't tell Mr. Park that I'm meeting you two here.

42
00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:33.076
Why did you come see us?

43
00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:34.617
Let me be honest.

44
00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.647
I'm a lawyer who used to be a prosecutor.

45
00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:38.987
I dealt with many similar cases when I was a prosecutor.

46
00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:40.717
At first, I wanted to get better performance reviews,

47
00:02:40.717 --> 00:02:42.557
so I always prosecuted the offenders.

48
00:02:42.726 --> 00:02:44.156
Just like Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan.

49
00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:46.096
But I've changed.

50
00:02:46.297 --> 00:02:49.166
I don't care whether Mr. Park goes to jail or not.

51
00:02:49.497 --> 00:02:51.596
But you two are the ones I care about.

52
00:02:52.136 --> 00:02:54.536
If this case is put on a trial,

53
00:02:55.606 --> 00:02:58.006
Mr. Park will stop supporting you financially right away.

54
00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:02.606
So Yoon's career as a pianist and major competitions will all be gone.

55
00:03:02.606 --> 00:03:05.446
Your daughter will lose her talent, future, and everything else.

56
00:03:06.547 --> 00:03:09.747
I can't bear to hear you talk rubbish anymore.

57
00:03:09.747 --> 00:03:12.856
Do you think she can't survive without her husband?

58
00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:14.726
Don't be scared.

59
00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:16.587
After you get divorced, divide the property...

60
00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:18.297
and receive child support expenses from him.

61
00:03:19.397 --> 00:03:22.626
That's right. The documents are ready too.

62
00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:27.666
Do you think Mr. Park isn't even ready for those?

63
00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:30.036
I'm not sure, but he must have hidden all his property...

64
00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:32.906
under someone else's name or siphoned off everything to overseas.

65
00:03:33.707 --> 00:03:38.017
He could have prepared to not give even a penny to you when divorced.

66
00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:43.086
With Mr. Park and So Yoon's reputation,

67
00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:45.516
your trial will be exposed to media for certain.

68
00:03:45.756 --> 00:03:47.386
Whenever people watch So Yoon's performance,

69
00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:49.987
they will think of her convicted dad.

70
00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:53.227
Mr. Park is not the one who will lose everything after the trial.

71
00:03:53.497 --> 00:03:54.566
It's you two.

72
00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:58.696
That's why I gave him the consent form not to prosecute him.

73
00:03:58.797 --> 00:04:00.597
What more can I do from here?

74
00:04:00.597 --> 00:04:04.737
Prosecutor Jang will prosecute him anyway, ignoring that consent form.

75
00:04:04.907 --> 00:04:07.706
You have to do more. You have to beg him if you need to.

76
00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:10.247
It's for your daughter.

77
00:04:21.256 --> 00:04:23.026
Then what's to come next?

78
00:04:25.227 --> 00:04:26.727
My dad will be released...

79
00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:31.237
and the horrible days will return.

80
00:04:32.737 --> 00:04:33.836
It'll be different this time.

81
00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:36.836
This is the letter of apology your dad wrote.

82
00:04:37.336 --> 00:04:40.076
You'll notice how he's changed after you read it.

83
00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:42.576
I'm going to give up on piano and everything else.

84
00:04:43.247 --> 00:04:44.776
I don't need his help.

85
00:04:45.977 --> 00:04:47.376
I don't need this either.

86
00:04:48.086 --> 00:04:49.417
I'll go talk to the prosecutor.

87
00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:51.687
Mom.

88
00:04:51.816 --> 00:04:55.626
I'm okay. I'm really okay, so don't give up on piano.

89
00:04:56.187 --> 00:04:59.597
I'll go talk to the prosecutor tomorrow and try everything I can.

90
00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:03.927
Please stop begging!

91
00:05:15.977 --> 00:05:17.206
There's no need for that.

92
00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:26.016
Jae Chan.

93
00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:30.427
I think this case is an injury case.

94
00:05:30.557 --> 00:05:33.497
I'm going to prosecute him no matter how much you cry.

95
00:05:35.927 --> 00:05:36.927
I definitely will.

96
00:05:38.497 --> 00:05:41.407
I've read through Mr. Park's letter of apology,

97
00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:43.766
but nothing has changed from his last letter of apology.

98
00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:46.737
He's either not too creative, or he's never changed.

99
00:05:47.237 --> 00:05:49.376
"I will never let this happen if you let me go this time."

100
00:05:50.506 --> 00:05:51.776
It's the same line as the one from four months ago.

101
00:05:52.677 --> 00:05:54.716
And the same thing happened again.

102
00:05:57.047 --> 00:05:58.557
Goodness, there's another same line here.

103
00:05:58.857 --> 00:06:00.756
"I'll slip out of my old skin and become a new man."

104
00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:04.927
You know, humans don't slip out of their skins.

105
00:06:07.797 --> 00:06:08.826
Only snakes do.

106
00:06:08.927 --> 00:06:12.266
Snakes become bigger and creepier as they slip out of their old skins.

107
00:06:13.696 --> 00:06:15.607
Please leave the table, Prosecutor Jang.

108
00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:18.037
I'm here to give them my advice.

109
00:06:18.037 --> 00:06:19.807
That's not an advice, but a threat.

110
00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:23.477
Go give Mr. Park an advice since he's the one you care about.

111
00:06:24.516 --> 00:06:26.316
Tell him to confess, and I'll see if I can have mercy on him.

112
00:06:31.886 --> 00:06:33.917
Don't cry. Don't be scared either.

113
00:06:34.586 --> 00:06:37.927
I know this man well. He knows he'll lose if we follow the laws,

114
00:06:37.927 --> 00:06:40.497
so he came to bluff like a tiger,

115
00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:42.727
but he's only a cat.

116
00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:46.196
What I mean is, we can just follow the laws.

117
00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:49.566
You have to be firm on him, so he doesn't bother you again.

118
00:07:02.086 --> 00:07:04.886
Don't worry. I'll make sure to protect your mother.

119
00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:08.657
How childish.

120
00:07:11.427 --> 00:07:12.657
I'm not a kid.

121
00:07:13.297 --> 00:07:15.266
Why did you bring up a tiger and a cat?

122
00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:20.367
I'm sorry. What I meant was...

123
00:07:20.367 --> 00:07:21.407
It's okay.

124
00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:24.206
I understood it all right.

125
00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:53.537
- What happened? - Goodness.

126
00:07:53.537 --> 00:07:56.537
What do we do? She's bleeding.

127
00:07:56.907 --> 00:07:59.177
Gosh, what do we do?

128
00:07:59.407 --> 00:08:02.007
My goodness, this is horrible.

129
00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:12.157
The little detail I changed stopped something horrible from happening.

130
00:08:27.606 --> 00:08:29.637
I'll wash them, so you can go inside.

131
00:08:29.637 --> 00:08:30.767
You can't hurt your hands.

132
00:08:31.407 --> 00:08:32.976
That'd be better.

133
00:08:33.576 --> 00:08:35.377
Then I wouldn't need to play the piano,

134
00:08:35.407 --> 00:08:37.816
and my mom won't have to get hit and cry.

135
00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:39.116
That'd be better.

136
00:08:39.547 --> 00:08:43.746
So what? Were you going to stab your hand with a chopstick?

137
00:08:45.517 --> 00:08:46.557
Yes.

138
00:08:50.257 --> 00:08:52.427
I can live without a piano,

139
00:08:54.027 --> 00:08:55.627
but I can't live without my mom.

140
00:09:02.066 --> 00:09:03.537
I know how you feel.

141
00:09:04.537 --> 00:09:05.907
What do you know?

142
00:09:08.706 --> 00:09:10.507
I do know. I completely know how you feel.

143
00:09:11.576 --> 00:09:13.346
You don't. You completely don't know how I feel.

144
00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:35.966
What... What is it?

145
00:09:36.537 --> 00:09:38.606
I should help them as a neighbor when they're busy.

146
00:09:38.606 --> 00:09:41.576
I noticed it when you gave them rice cakes when we first moved here.

147
00:09:41.576 --> 00:09:43.576
I noticed you love your neighbors very much.

148
00:09:43.746 --> 00:09:46.346
You're such a sweet and righteous man.

149
00:09:46.576 --> 00:09:48.047
That's because I take after you.

150
00:09:48.787 --> 00:09:49.917
Me? Why?

151
00:09:51.586 --> 00:09:53.557
You better keep that promise you made to So Yoon.

152
00:09:54.086 --> 00:09:55.127
I believe in you.

153
00:09:56.287 --> 00:09:57.657
Take off that apron.

154
00:10:00.826 --> 00:10:04.196
Two servings of pork belly meat and doenjang jjigae.

155
00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:05.397
That's 32 dollars. Are you paying by card?

156
00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:06.437
Yes.

157
00:10:12.637 --> 00:10:14.877
- That's a relief. - What?

158
00:10:15.677 --> 00:10:17.576
I mean... Just everything.

159
00:10:22.446 --> 00:10:24.657
Mr. Han Woo Tak, this is not a coincidence, is it?

160
00:10:25.017 --> 00:10:27.257
How you met me earlier and brought me here.

161
00:10:27.257 --> 00:10:29.627
And Yu Beom being here. You knew all that, didn't you?

162
00:10:31.856 --> 00:10:32.927
I'll answer you.

163
00:10:34.326 --> 00:10:35.427
Only if you treat the next round.

164
00:10:40.537 --> 00:10:44.777
I mean, shouldn't this be an even deal?

165
00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:47.307
I treated you to pork belly meat and doenjang jjigae.

166
00:10:48.976 --> 00:10:50.507
And you're being this petty?

167
00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:53.777
Look. I'm not going to consider this as the next round.

168
00:10:55.616 --> 00:10:57.586
Stop bluffing and answer me.

169
00:10:57.816 --> 00:10:59.456
How can you explain what happened today?

170
00:11:00.356 --> 00:11:02.687
You might think I'm a crazy man if you hear this.

171
00:11:03.086 --> 00:11:05.196
Honestly, I can't believe this situation myself.

172
00:11:06.856 --> 00:11:07.966
Actually,

173
00:11:09.566 --> 00:11:11.537
I've seen what happened earlier in my dream.

174
00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:15.336
Gosh. You dream such things too?

175
00:11:15.437 --> 00:11:18.177
Hold on. What do you mean? You do too?

176
00:11:18.877 --> 00:11:19.907
I have such dreams too.

177
00:11:20.307 --> 00:11:22.547
I dream about what's going to happen later in reality.

178
00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:23.807
No way.

179
00:11:23.846 --> 00:11:25.346
I had that dream of what happened on the Valentine's day,

180
00:11:25.346 --> 00:11:27.116
so I could prevent the accident.

181
00:11:29.787 --> 00:11:30.787
This is unbelievable.

182
00:11:31.616 --> 00:11:34.757
Is this a common thing?

183
00:11:34.757 --> 00:11:36.257
Well, I'm not really sure about that.

184
00:11:37.387 --> 00:11:38.726
She is one of us too.

185
00:11:43.627 --> 00:11:44.667
What?

186
00:11:47.366 --> 00:11:52.606
(Episode 7: A Few Good Men)

187
00:11:55.446 --> 00:11:58.246
Is this a transferrable disease?

188
00:11:58.777 --> 00:11:59.917
I don't know.

189
00:12:00.346 --> 00:12:02.647
I haven't figured out why this happens.

190
00:12:02.746 --> 00:12:05.157
Is there anyone else who has such dreams other than us?

191
00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:08.787
No. I've been having such dreams for a long time.

192
00:12:08.787 --> 00:12:09.887
I've never seen anyone else except you two.

193
00:12:09.887 --> 00:12:12.027
Then there must be a common base among us.

194
00:12:14.527 --> 00:12:16.027
We all were born in the same year.

195
00:12:17.566 --> 00:12:19.537
There are so many people who were born that year.

196
00:12:20.496 --> 00:12:21.706
What's your blood type?

197
00:12:21.966 --> 00:12:22.966
- B type. - O type.

198
00:12:23.007 --> 00:12:24.007
Which month were you born?

199
00:12:24.007 --> 00:12:25.037
- April. - September.

200
00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.377
That's not it then.

201
00:12:33.576 --> 00:12:35.746
Hold on. Stop. This must be it.

202
00:12:35.946 --> 00:12:37.716
We all lick off from the cover.

203
00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.086
Amazing.

204
00:12:40.257 --> 00:12:42.787
Everyone in our country does except for the super riches.

205
00:12:44.226 --> 00:12:45.226
Is that so?

206
00:12:45.627 --> 00:12:49.127
Hold on. If all of this is true,

207
00:12:49.127 --> 00:12:50.696
we are like heroes.

208
00:12:50.826 --> 00:12:53.366
We stopped your brother from doing stupid things because of Mr. Park.

209
00:12:54.307 --> 00:12:55.336
We also saved your hand.

210
00:12:55.537 --> 00:12:56.836
Think of it the other way.

211
00:12:57.407 --> 00:13:00.307
If we didn't stop all those, horrible things would have happened.

212
00:13:00.507 --> 00:13:02.446
And Park Jun Mo case isn't even over yet.

213
00:13:03.507 --> 00:13:07.846
That'll be over once Prosecutor Jung gets him prosecuted.

214
00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:10.287
You're confident to keep that promise, right?

215
00:13:10.517 --> 00:13:11.557
I'll look forward to it.

216
00:13:12.557 --> 00:13:14.086
You don't have to.

217
00:13:18.427 --> 00:13:20.456
Why did you follow us to the convenience store?

218
00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:24.897
Oh, right. I had something to tell you.

219
00:13:25.866 --> 00:13:28.366
If you're going to tell me that you'll look forward to it,

220
00:13:28.366 --> 00:13:29.566
you believe me, or I should keep the promise, don't say it.

221
00:13:29.566 --> 00:13:30.877
I've heard enough.

222
00:13:31.106 --> 00:13:33.836
I especially don't want to hear those from you.

223
00:13:34.746 --> 00:13:36.076
That's not it.

224
00:13:37.777 --> 00:13:41.287
Open your coat wide as a way of promoting our store...

225
00:13:41.316 --> 00:13:43.316
so that people can see the apron well.

(Hong Joo Samgyeopsal)

227
00:13:46.517 --> 00:13:47.586
Gosh.

228
00:13:49.726 --> 00:13:51.956
Why don't you want to hear people say they'll look forward to it?

229
00:13:52.226 --> 00:13:53.427
That's their way of supporting you.

230
00:13:53.496 --> 00:13:55.326
It's more like a threat.

231
00:13:55.427 --> 00:13:56.966
It means they'll get disappointed...

232
00:13:56.966 --> 00:13:59.096
if I fail to save people.

233
00:13:59.866 --> 00:14:01.767
So you don't want to disappoint people.

234
00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:03.507
Wait.

235
00:14:05.836 --> 00:14:06.937
Then why is it me?

236
00:14:07.106 --> 00:14:09.547
Why don't you want to especially disappoint me?

237
00:14:10.446 --> 00:14:11.877
You're on it again.

238
00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:15.946
I don't want to disappoint anyone, even the dogs on the street.

239
00:14:17.687 --> 00:14:20.157
I think I get what you mean.

240
00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:22.726
I have this ability to understand...

241
00:14:22.726 --> 00:14:24.897
even the most complicated things.

242
00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:27.566
Gosh. Complicated, my foot.

243
00:14:29.066 --> 00:14:30.096
Goodness.

244
00:14:34.466 --> 00:14:37.507
Why does she have to understand it so well?

245
00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:45.746
He's leaving.

246
00:14:47.076 --> 00:14:49.687
Hey, why do we have to hide?

247
00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:51.517
It's not like we did something.

248
00:14:51.517 --> 00:14:54.527
I just didn't want him to misunderstand us.

249
00:14:54.687 --> 00:14:55.726
Gosh.

250
00:14:56.127 --> 00:14:58.057
Where is your brother going at this hour?

251
00:14:58.096 --> 00:14:59.196
I think he's going to work.

252
00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:01.696
At this hour? Why does he have to?

253
00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:03.027
I'm not sure.

254
00:15:04.066 --> 00:15:07.966
He probably doesn't want to disappoint anyone.

Good morning.

257
00:15:48.346 --> 00:15:49.377
Why did you stop midway?

258
00:15:50.507 --> 00:15:51.576
What's he doing?

259
00:15:51.746 --> 00:15:53.346
I wouldn't have stopped midway if I knew that.

260
00:15:54.716 --> 00:15:57.287
- Good morning. - Have you stayed up to work?

261
00:15:58.316 --> 00:15:59.917
Of course. What else would I have done here?

262
00:16:00.616 --> 00:16:03.856
Oh, Ms. Moon. Could you borrow all the previous records of Park Jun Mo?

263
00:16:04.527 --> 00:16:05.527
Park Jun Mo again?

264
00:16:05.726 --> 00:16:08.927
I think I've become best friends with Park Jun Mo now.

265
00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:11.897
Mr. Choi, let's go investigate the scene with me.

266
00:16:11.966 --> 00:16:15.167
- The scene? - I want to go alone too,

267
00:16:15.736 --> 00:16:18.277
but it's the right procedure to go together. I'll do the investigation.

268
00:16:18.576 --> 00:16:20.706
- Let's go. - All right.

269
00:16:26.047 --> 00:16:27.846
Why are we investigating the scene?

270
00:16:27.846 --> 00:16:29.746
I took off my underclothes.

271
00:16:31.087 --> 00:16:32.157
Let me borrow your lotion.

272
00:16:33.657 --> 00:16:35.226
Why do you have to apply it?

273
00:16:35.627 --> 00:16:36.927
Prosecutor Jung, wait up!

274
00:16:39.157 --> 00:16:40.327
I'm tired of them.

275
00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:55.506
Are you drawing it?

276
00:16:55.677 --> 00:16:58.177
- Yes. - Goodness. You're good.

Thank you.

278

What's the fifth number?

279
00:17:12.696 --> 00:17:15.367
It's number 27 on the red ball.

280
00:17:15.526 --> 00:17:16.796
The sixth ball is...

281
00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:20.266
number 33 on the grey one.

282
00:17:20.367 --> 00:17:22.937
Gosh. Nothing works for me.

It's numbers 45, 15, 35, 43, 27,

287
00:17:34.347 --> 00:17:37.587
33, and 16. Congratulations.

I can't believe it's morning already.

289
00:18:10.917 --> 00:18:12.756
Have some breakfast before you go. I made an egg rice.

290
00:18:12.786 --> 00:18:13.956
I can't. I'm too busy.

291
00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:15.456
I'll get going.

292
00:18:19.327 --> 00:18:20.526
Darn it.

Woo Bin, is it good?

294
00:18:34.177 --> 00:18:36.147
I think this would taste better than mine if I add some seasoning.

00:18:43.147 --> 00:18:45.187
You make monkfish jjim at home?

296
00:18:45.187 --> 00:18:47.387
I've been dying to make it at home,

297
00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:49.456
but there are just two of us, so I couldn't.

298
00:18:49.556 --> 00:18:52.996
But I made it because there are four of us today.

299
00:18:53.157 --> 00:18:54.427
We have something to celebrate too.

300
00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:56.627
Celebrate? What is it?

301
00:18:56.726 --> 00:18:58.996
Today, we got a call from Evan Foundation.

302
00:18:59.266 --> 00:19:00.766
They wanted to support So Yoon.

303
00:19:01.036 --> 00:19:03.407
Really? Then are you going to study abroad?

304
00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:06.407
Well, I can go if nothing else happens.

305
00:19:06.577 --> 00:19:10.046
I think we can go into our house within this week.

00:19:10.046 --> 00:19:12.716
Oh, right. You told me this week is the last week for investigation.

00:19:12.716 --> 00:19:14.746
Prosecutor Jung called me earlier.

308
00:19:14.986 --> 00:19:17.347
He told me that Jun Mo won't be released easily this time.

309
00:19:17.347 --> 00:19:18.986
He told me not to worry much.

310
00:19:19.056 --> 00:19:21.127
My gosh. He's such a sweet person.

311
00:19:21.127 --> 00:19:22.486
He even gave you a call?

312
00:19:22.556 --> 00:19:25.456
Yes, he did. He's so trustable.

313
00:19:25.756 --> 00:19:28.966
I know, right? He is a decent man.

314
00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:31.097
He's also very competent.

315
00:19:44.817 --> 00:19:45.847
Thank you.

316
00:19:47.417 --> 00:19:48.446
Thank you.

317
00:21:12.266 --> 00:21:13.667
We're here. Get up.

318
00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:16.006
Thanks.

319
00:21:16.107 --> 00:21:19.006
If you're grateful, then get up. Hurry now.

320
00:21:20.107 --> 00:21:21.147
Mr. Jung Jae Chan.

321
00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:26.647
You must have had a dream.

322
00:21:27.347 --> 00:21:28.347
What did you dream about?

323
00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:30.347
Did you dream about something that's going to happen later?

324
00:21:32.887 --> 00:21:35.256
- No, I didn't - Then what was it?

325
00:21:35.286 --> 00:21:36.887
Press the bell. We have to get off here.

326
00:21:36.887 --> 00:21:38.327
This station is Prosecutors' Office.

327
00:21:39.056 --> 00:21:41.766
Please get off safely.

328
00:21:53.536 --> 00:21:55.677
Ms. Nam, what do you do for living?

329
00:21:55.677 --> 00:21:56.976
Don't you have a job?

330
00:21:56.976 --> 00:21:59.847
Wait, are you finally interested in me?

331
00:22:00.046 --> 00:22:02.946
That interest will lead to love interest.

332
00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:06.587
Are you going to take that typical procedure?

333
00:22:06.786 --> 00:22:09.387
Then I'd love to be a part of it.

334
00:22:10.157 --> 00:22:11.357
Be a part of what?

335
00:22:11.597 --> 00:22:13.927
I asked you because you follow me around every day.

336
00:22:13.927 --> 00:22:15.526
But this is only the second time.

337
00:22:15.526 --> 00:22:16.867
- Do you want it every day? - No, I don't.

338
00:22:16.867 --> 00:22:19.437
I don't want it at all, but you always follow me around.

339
00:22:20.196 --> 00:22:21.736
There's a reason I do that.

340
00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:23.407
A reason?

341
00:22:23.407 --> 00:22:26.877
I dreamed of you, and you ended up sleeping until the last stop.

342
00:22:27.476 --> 00:22:30.476
You were super late, so you got scolded by your boss.

343
00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:32.377
I'm sorry I'm late.

344
00:22:32.377 --> 00:22:34.847
It's almost lunch time and you're here now?

345
00:22:35.786 --> 00:22:38.956
You're going to have a rough day because of Park Jun Mo’s case.

346
00:22:39.917 --> 00:22:42.756
I followed you to save the trouble of getting scolded.

347
00:22:44.827 --> 00:22:45.857
A rough day?

348
00:22:48.526 --> 00:22:49.526
I won't allow that.

349
00:22:50.127 --> 00:22:52.266
I couldn't sleep more than 5 hours for the last 4 days...

350
00:22:52.266 --> 00:22:54.266
because I had to deal with the cases I couldn't deal with.

351
00:22:54.736 --> 00:22:57.776
If I finish Park Jun Mo case today, we'll be able to prosecute him.

352
00:22:58.036 --> 00:23:01.077
In the term of baseball, I'd call it a cold game.

353
00:23:15.857 --> 00:23:17.427
Why are you making that face again?

354
00:23:17.427 --> 00:23:18.756
Did you have a bad dream?

355
00:23:19.127 --> 00:23:20.226
No, I didn't.

356
00:23:20.226 --> 00:23:23.367
Then don't make such a serious face.

357
00:23:23.367 --> 00:23:26.097
It makes me anxious. I'm going.

358
00:23:27.337 --> 00:23:28.367
Mr. Jung Jae Chan.

359
00:23:29.036 --> 00:23:30.036
What again?

360
00:23:30.837 --> 00:23:31.837
You can do it!

361
00:23:33.437 --> 00:23:36.647
- You can do it. - I told you not to support me.

362
00:23:50.357 --> 00:23:52.756
I don't think I need to go to the Prosecutor's Office for questioning.

363
00:23:52.756 --> 00:23:54.127
Why has this gotten so big?

364
00:23:54.127 --> 00:23:57.567
I can't do anything about it because your wife wants you to be punished.

365
00:23:57.637 --> 00:23:58.796
You have to answer them.

366
00:24:02.637 --> 00:24:04.236
I don't think just one will do.

367
00:24:04.476 --> 00:24:06.536
You're weaker than I thought.

368
00:24:07.377 --> 00:24:09.006
It's my first time in the Prosecutors' Office.

369
00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:11.647
We have the original files of the CCTV footages.

370
00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:14.847
We also bribed the doctor who wrote the medical report.

371
00:24:16.317 --> 00:24:19.286
We're ready for everything. Why are you so worried?

372
00:24:19.716 --> 00:24:22.627
Other lawyers can't even say much when they're in the Prosecutors' Office.

373
00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:25.827
I'm different. If anything happens, I can cover for you.

374
00:24:26.357 --> 00:24:27.397
So don't worry.

375
00:24:27.726 --> 00:24:29.667
- Let's go. - I'm not worried.

376
00:24:29.667 --> 00:24:31.536
I know how meticulous your work style is.

377
00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:32.567
Hold on.

378
00:24:33.036 --> 00:24:34.837
You can relax.

379
00:24:35.536 --> 00:24:36.806
You're not guilty, are you?

380
00:24:37.706 --> 00:24:39.137
Of course not.

381
00:24:39.677 --> 00:24:40.907
Don't be too relaxed.

382
00:24:41.907 --> 00:24:42.907
You look too shameless.

383
00:24:45.647 --> 00:24:46.847
Gosh, it's so difficult.

384
00:24:50.617 --> 00:24:52.256
(Police Station)

385
00:24:52.587 --> 00:24:55.657
The common factor among the three of us is that we were born in 1988.

386
00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:58.157
Our birthdays and blood types don't match.

387
00:25:00.327 --> 00:25:01.367
We're good looking.

388
00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:03.327
- That place makes nice japchae. - Right.

389
00:25:04.196 --> 00:25:06.337
Hey, you can go have lunch now.

390
00:25:06.796 --> 00:25:09.536
- Yes, sir. - Where is Chief Oh, by the way?

391
00:25:10.236 --> 00:25:12.776
He went to the Prosecutors' Office as a witness for Park Jun Mo case.

392
00:25:12.877 --> 00:25:15.706
Chief Oh is so weak-hearted. He should be strong there.

393
00:25:15.907 --> 00:25:18.446
Then you're going to have lunch alone, Lieutenant Han.

394
00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:21.317
Do you want me to go along?

395
00:25:21.587 --> 00:25:24.256
I had a small lunch, so...

396
00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:26.256
No, it's okay. I think I'm going to meet someone.

397
00:25:26.857 --> 00:25:28.687
Oh, right. I knew that was going to happen.

398
00:25:29.827 --> 00:25:31.827
(Hong Joo Samgyeopsal)

399
00:25:37.367 --> 00:25:38.397
Excuse me.

400
00:25:39.367 --> 00:25:41.567
- My goodness. - You're that guy.

401
00:25:41.567 --> 00:25:43.736
You're the one who found my cell phone, aren't you?

402
00:25:43.736 --> 00:25:45.976
Yes, I am. Hello.

403
00:25:45.976 --> 00:25:47.607
What are you doing? Why don't you go in?

404
00:25:47.607 --> 00:25:49.677
- Well, I just... - Come on.

405
00:25:49.706 --> 00:25:50.746
Okay.

406
00:25:52.746 --> 00:25:54.687
I heard that the highest level of eating alone is...

407
00:25:54.687 --> 00:25:56.147
grilling meat, isn't that right?

408
00:25:56.417 --> 00:25:59.486
Yes, you're right. I loved the meat last time I came.

409
00:25:59.486 --> 00:26:01.427
It tasted like the meal my mom prepared for me.

410
00:26:01.427 --> 00:26:03.256
Okay, I got you.

411
00:26:04.256 --> 00:26:05.796
Stop flattering me.

412
00:26:06.597 --> 00:26:08.427
What's the purpose of your visit?

413
00:26:08.726 --> 00:26:11.496
There's none. I really love the food here.

414
00:26:15.337 --> 00:26:16.867
- Hong Joo. - Hey.

415
00:26:17.306 --> 00:26:18.476
Are you here to have lunch?

416
00:26:18.706 --> 00:26:19.937
What? Yes, I am.

417
00:26:19.937 --> 00:26:21.347
You're having pork belly meat alone?

418
00:26:21.347 --> 00:26:24.617
Yes, I love having pork belly meat alone during lunch time.

419
00:26:25.046 --> 00:26:26.077
You're unique.

420
00:26:26.377 --> 00:26:29.986
Hong Joo, I'm going to organize things. You grill the meat for him.

421
00:26:30.016 --> 00:26:31.056
Okay.

422
00:26:31.687 --> 00:26:33.556
Let's eat together. I ordered two portions.

423
00:26:35.286 --> 00:26:38.097
How about we have a party later in the evening?

424
00:26:38.097 --> 00:26:39.427
Let's make Prosecutor Jung treat us.

425
00:26:39.427 --> 00:26:41.927
I can't let that happen. He must be feeling awful later.

426
00:26:41.927 --> 00:26:44.667
Why is that? Isn't today the last day of investigation on Park Jun Mo?

427
00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:46.867
I had a dream about it, and the investigation is all ruined.

428
00:26:46.867 --> 00:26:47.867
He won't be prosecuted.

429
00:26:48.167 --> 00:26:50.706
So we can't have a party, unless we're going to console him.

430
00:26:51.236 --> 00:26:52.236
I had the opposite dream.

431
00:26:53.236 --> 00:26:56.306
In my dream, Prosecutor Jung prosecuted Park Jun Mo well.

432
00:26:57.177 --> 00:26:58.516
And Park Jun Mo begged him.

433
00:26:58.746 --> 00:26:59.776
Really?

434
00:27:06.387 --> 00:27:07.387
Mr. Park Jun Mo.

435
00:27:08.087 --> 00:27:10.327
You said this in last year's investigation.

436
00:27:11.226 --> 00:27:13.597
"It's all because of my wife who deserves the beating."

437
00:27:15.696 --> 00:27:16.966
In that case,

438
00:27:17.466 --> 00:27:20.496
is it the women's fault when perverts take their photos?

439
00:27:21.036 --> 00:27:24.067
Is it the victims' fault if they get their money stolen by a thief?

440
00:27:25.306 --> 00:27:26.306
Then...

441
00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:34.216
even if I do anything to you in here,

442
00:27:36.087 --> 00:27:38.456
it'll be your fault for saying wrong things.

443
00:27:39.786 --> 00:27:40.887
It'll be your fault.

444
00:27:47.996 --> 00:27:49.897
It's your fault.

445
00:27:50.526 --> 00:27:51.567
Is that too rude?

446
00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:53.496
It is in your fault.

447
00:27:55.506 --> 00:27:57.266
That's too awkward.

448
00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:00.137
Is there anything that's more impressive?

449
00:28:00.137 --> 00:28:03.407
I need to say something more impressive.

450
00:28:13.917 --> 00:28:15.427
What on earth is he doing?

451
00:28:15.657 --> 00:28:17.526
What's he doing? It's not like the old days.

452
00:28:17.526 --> 00:28:19.327
Look at him. Is he a royal inspector or something?

453
00:28:21.196 --> 00:28:24.897
He doesn't know that we are sitting here, does he?

454
00:28:24.937 --> 00:28:26.837
Well, he wouldn't do that if he knew.

455
00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:30.337
He's only doing that because he wants to do well.

456
00:28:30.407 --> 00:28:32.306
Let's just pretend we didn't see anything.

457
00:28:32.306 --> 00:28:34.806
Even if he does that, Park Jun Mo won't confess.

458
00:28:34.806 --> 00:28:36.177
Raise your hand if you think he won't be prosecuted.

459
00:28:38.276 --> 00:28:40.847
Oh, my. Goodness, look at him.

460
00:28:42.162 --> 00:28:45.171
(Episode 8 will air shortly.)
