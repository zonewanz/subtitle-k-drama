(Episode 10)

4
00:00:26.844 --> 00:00:28.012
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.149
The doctor won't let her go.

6
00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:33.217
She's a cardiothoracic doctor, Choi Yeon Kyung.

7
00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:35.553
It looks like she won't give up. What should we do?

8
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.123
Okay, I'll do that.

9
00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:44.929
It looks like you should get treated first.

10
00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.366
How will you treat patients when you're always trembling like that?

11
00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:52.804
You jerk.

12
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:57.942
How much do you get paid from my father for this?

13
00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.678
If it's not money, do you get a fancy car?

14
00:01:02.347 --> 00:01:04.148
Did he say he would buy you a building?

15
00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:12.824
Oh, my. You punk.

16
00:01:13.324 --> 00:01:15.493
Take him to his room.

17
00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:26.437
The doctor says it is endocarditis.

18
00:01:26.604 --> 00:01:28.005
According to the doctor...

19
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:30.508
If it was all right for me to take him to the doctor,

20
00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:33.244
why would I have called you?

21
00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:35.079
He is my only son.

22
00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.181
I can't let him live the rest of his life...

23
00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:39.317
as a drug addict and a criminal.

24
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.651
Take this,

25
00:01:40.918 --> 00:01:42.153
and leave.

26
00:01:43.054 --> 00:01:45.523
I don't want to see you ever again.

27
00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:24.162
Pour water in here and wait for three minutes.

28
00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:25.763
You should count to 200...

29
00:02:25.763 --> 00:02:26.998
after pouring in water.

30
00:02:27.832 --> 00:02:29.901
Plug this in, and press the button.

31
00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:32.603
After that, you wait.

32
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:51.422
One,

33
00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:56.727
2, 3.

34
00:02:58.596 --> 00:02:59.597
Four.

35
00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:02.500
Five.

36
00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:04.669
He looks better on the outside,

37
00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.504
but he's become a really bad person.

38
00:03:06.504 --> 00:03:07.572
Really?

39
00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:09.540
He just passed you by without saying hello?

40
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.510
I told you so. He didn't even say hello to me.

41
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.045
That scumbag.

42
00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:16.013
What would happen to Kkot Bun?

43
00:03:16.013 --> 00:03:18.382
She always talks about him.

44
00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:21.619
I know. He shouldn't have called her "Mother" in the first place.

45
00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:22.787
I'm so upset.

46
00:03:22.787 --> 00:03:25.089
You are, aren't you? I'm upset too.

47
00:03:31.762 --> 00:03:34.732
It looks like you should get treated first.

48
00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:38.069
How will you treat patients when you're always trembling like that?

49
00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:41.072
Do you have any right to call yourself a doctor?

50
00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:06.864
No, Jae Sook. You shouldn't drink.

51
00:04:06.864 --> 00:04:07.965
It's not good for your liver.

52
00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:10.134
I'll take care of myself.

53
00:04:10.134 --> 00:04:13.070
Let's just have chicken skewers instead of alcohol.

54
00:04:16.574 --> 00:04:17.775
Is it you, Yeon Kyung?

55
00:04:18.276 --> 00:04:19.844
Hello, Jae Sook.

56
00:04:19.844 --> 00:04:20.978
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:20.978 --> 00:04:24.015
You should have dinner at home. Why are you eating out here?

58
00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:25.383
The director was cooking something.

59
00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:28.886
Yes. Why are you eating noodles and drinking soda by yourself?

60
00:04:28.886 --> 00:04:31.522
If you're at a cart bar, you should at least have soju.

61
00:04:32.223 --> 00:04:34.158
Ma'am, we'd like to have chicken skewers and soju please.

62
00:04:34.158 --> 00:04:36.961
Jae Sook, Yeon Kyung doesn't drink.

63
00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:39.830
As a doctor, she's prepared to perform...

64
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.533
at an unexpected place or time just in case she meets a patient.

65
00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:45.102
She even has medical equipment in her bag.

66
00:04:45.102 --> 00:04:46.704
But aren't you drinking too many sodas?

67
00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:48.139
You can get drunk from this too.

68
00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.974
Jae Sook, you should learn from her.

69
00:04:49.974 --> 00:04:52.410
Why are you so talkative today?

70
00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:55.079
She's a doctor, but I am not.

71
00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:56.814
Gosh, you stupid man.

72
00:04:57.715 --> 00:04:59.350
Do I deserve to be a doctor?

73
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.851
What are you talking about?

74
00:05:01.352 --> 00:05:03.955
Heo Bong Tak is the one who doesn't deserve to be a doctor.

75
00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:07.158
That scumbag. How can a man change so much?

76
00:05:07.158 --> 00:05:10.461
That's why people say you shouldn't take in strangers to your home.

77
00:05:11.462 --> 00:05:13.598
Pour me some drinks, stranger.

78
00:05:13.598 --> 00:05:16.701
No, you shouldn't drink this. He was like that from the start.

79
00:05:16.701 --> 00:05:18.336
He wasn't.

80
00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.037
He has changed.

81
00:05:20.037 --> 00:05:22.206
No, he was like that from the start.

82
00:05:22.206 --> 00:05:23.708
He has changed.

83
00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.843
Why do you keep taking the drink? He was always like that.

84
00:05:25.843 --> 00:05:28.346
- No one is born kind. - He has changed.

85
00:05:28.346 --> 00:05:30.514
- Why do you keep taking this? - I decide what I drink.

86
00:05:30.514 --> 00:05:33.150
- Your liver is not in a good state. - Gosh.

87

(Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic)

89
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.600
Gosh. What should I do? What should I do?

90
00:05:50.635 --> 00:05:53.270
Hey, aren't you Bong Tak?

91
00:05:57.575 --> 00:06:00.945
Gosh, you were here.

92
00:06:00.945 --> 00:06:05.349
Ms. Kkot Bun went out to give you some snacks...

93
00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.152
and fainted on the way.

94
00:06:09.353 --> 00:06:10.588
Where is she?

95
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.041
Mother.

96
00:06:42.153 --> 00:06:43.154
Mother.

97

Mother.

98
00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:13.150
I brought snacks for you.

99
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.153
When you were little,

100
00:07:16.153 --> 00:07:20.024
you wanted to have this so much.

101
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.135
You did not need to give me this.

102
00:07:31.702 --> 00:07:33.037
Mother, I am sorry.

103
00:07:33.838 --> 00:07:36.073
Mother, it is my fault.

104
00:07:37.475 --> 00:07:38.476
It is all right.

105
00:07:38.976 --> 00:07:41.278
It is all right.

106
00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:46.283
The pulse is beating slowly.

107
00:07:46.784 --> 00:07:48.219
The pulse of her heart...

108
00:07:49.086 --> 00:07:50.254
is stopping.

109
00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:53.090

Excuse me,

111
00:08:11.842 --> 00:08:12.910
is anyone there?

112
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.079
Someone is dying here.

113

Is there anyone nearby? Please help!

114

I heard Ms. Kkot Bun has fainted nearby. I'm on my way there.

All right.

Please, please help her.

140
00:10:07.091 --> 00:10:08.459
Her heart...

141
00:10:08.826 --> 00:10:10.461
is stopping.

142
00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:13.297
Her pulse is too slow.

143

It was my fault.

145
00:10:50.434 --> 00:10:52.970
Are you done? Is she going to be all right?

146
00:10:53.203 --> 00:10:54.204
No.

147
00:10:54.705 --> 00:10:56.874
But the worst is over.

148
00:10:57.341 --> 00:10:59.576
I called the ambulance. When they arrive,

149
00:11:00.844 --> 00:11:02.980
she needs to go to the hospital and get examined.

152
00:11:31.075 --> 00:11:32.476
It went all right.

153
00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:34.712
However, she might have an arrhythmia.

154
00:11:34.712 --> 00:11:37.982
Goodness, she said it went all right.

saved Bong Sik's mom!

- It's true. - Yes, she's my granddaughter.

Goodness. Everyone knows that she's so competent.

161

Come on. Haven't heard that before?

162
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.303
- My goodness. - She has a reputation...

163

that she's so good at treating patients.

164

How is that patient doing? Is he all right?

he could be in danger if he's not treated soon.

170
00:12:41.211 --> 00:12:43.347
You'd better bring him to the hospital as soon as possible.

171
00:12:45.749 --> 00:12:47.851
He's not your patient anymore.

172
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.121
If you cannot trust me,

173
00:12:53.057 --> 00:12:54.725
I could recommend another doctor.

174
00:12:56.994 --> 00:12:59.997
Have your shoulder treated too before it gets infected.

175
00:13:01.598 --> 00:13:02.733
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:07.237 --> 00:13:11.575
I knew how much you could get hurt by what I said.

177
00:13:16.847 --> 00:13:18.582
You didn't say anything wrong.

178
00:13:20.484 --> 00:13:22.252
When something like that kept happening,

179
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.955
I became worried myself.

180
00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:31.628
I thought I might lose a patient at a critical moment.

181
00:13:33.197 --> 00:13:35.566
Whether I could keep working as a doctor,

182
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:38.469
and whether I deserve to be one.

183
00:13:39.603 --> 00:13:40.804
Just now,

184
00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:43.841
you saved that old lady.

185
00:13:46.677 --> 00:13:48.579
You're a great doctor as ever.

186
00:13:51.215 --> 00:13:52.716
You will also be in the future.

187
00:14:00.224 --> 00:14:02.226
I know you will come back.

188
00:14:02.693 --> 00:14:04.228
You should just resent me.

189
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.233
Tell me I am a doctor who ignores a dying patient and lusts for money.

190
00:14:12.469 --> 00:14:15.005
- You can turn your back on me. - I won't.

191
00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:19.510
I will trust you and wait for you.

192
00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:24.481
I know what kind of a person you are.

193
00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:35.759
When my dad died when I was young,

194
00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:39.830
a man gave me this candy.

195
00:14:41.165 --> 00:14:43.066
That candy had a strange shape,

196
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.571
but I felt better after eating it.

197
00:14:48.338 --> 00:14:49.473
Since then,

198
00:14:50.274 --> 00:14:51.708
when I'm depressed,

199
00:14:53.343 --> 00:14:54.711
or when I need to cheer up,

200
00:14:56.613 --> 00:14:57.915
I eat candy.

201
00:15:05.956 --> 00:15:07.191
Candy is...

202
00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.727
for such occasions.

203
00:15:43.093 --> 00:15:44.361
- What? - Gosh.

204
00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:47.297
I got you, you punk!

205
00:15:48.966 --> 00:15:51.301
When are you going to pay my 87 dollars back?

206
00:15:53.003 --> 00:15:55.072
It's amazing that you recognized me at a glance.

207
00:15:55.072 --> 00:15:56.340
Goodness.

208
00:16:01.545 --> 00:16:03.247
I think you got the wrong person.

209
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:05.582
Way to go, punk.

210
00:16:05.816 --> 00:16:08.585
You're a doctor who cannot take care of your body.

211
00:16:09.086 --> 00:16:11.054
It's done.

212
00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:19.696
So, do you like working here?

213
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.100
Yes, I do.

214
00:16:24.167 --> 00:16:26.503
A doctor should...

215
00:16:26.503 --> 00:16:30.107
not forget his original intention...

216
00:16:30.107 --> 00:16:34.144
why he wanted to be a doctor.

217
00:16:37.047 --> 00:16:40.851
By the way, where's the acupuncture kit you carried all the time?

218
00:16:41.318 --> 00:16:44.254
- Pardon? - When you were with Ms. Kkot Bun,

219
00:16:44.488 --> 00:16:47.457
you couldn't do anything and cried like a child, I heard.

220
00:16:47.457 --> 00:16:50.227
Who says I cried? I didn't.

221
00:16:51.194 --> 00:16:52.562
About the acupuncture kit,

222
00:16:53.697 --> 00:16:54.865
I threw it away.

223
00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:57.634
Good job, good job.

224
00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:00.937
How can a doctor throw away his kit? It's just like his other self.

225
00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:04.608
Now that you changed your clothes and everything,

226
00:17:04.975 --> 00:17:07.678
did you feel it inconvenient to carry it around?

227
00:17:08.512 --> 00:17:09.646
I forgot!

228
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.316
Bok Man must be waiting for me.

229
00:17:12.316 --> 00:17:14.418
I promised him to make stir fried rice.

230
00:17:15.719 --> 00:17:19.222
You should come if you'd like it.

231
00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:20.557
Bye now.

232
00:17:21.058 --> 00:17:22.459
Take care, sir.

233
00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:39.476
He must have gotten an idea.

234
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.145
What was he thinking to throw the kit away?

235
00:17:42.713 --> 00:17:43.914
It's not like...

236
00:17:44.514 --> 00:17:46.983
it will ever go away.

237
00:17:57.728 --> 00:18:00.163
A doctor should...

238
00:18:00.731 --> 00:18:04.267
not forget his original intention ...

239
00:18:04.267 --> 00:18:08.038
why he wanted to be a doctor.

240
00:18:18.782 --> 00:18:20.283
Gosh! Hey!

241
00:18:20.484 --> 00:18:22.753
Teach me medical techniques.

242
00:18:23.253 --> 00:18:25.122
You're driving me crazy.

243
00:18:26.957 --> 00:18:29.259
Please teach me, please!

244
00:18:29.393 --> 00:18:31.194
- Gosh. - Please.

245
00:18:33.163 --> 00:18:35.232
This is called jechim.

246
00:18:35.232 --> 00:18:38.969
You use this to open an acupuncture point when the patient feels weak.

247
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:41.138
- Amazing. - Hey.

248
00:18:41.805 --> 00:18:44.107
- Is it that amazing? - Yes, it is.

249
00:18:44.107 --> 00:18:45.509
What's so amazing?

250
00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:49.246
How can this long needle go into a human body...

251
00:18:49.913 --> 00:18:53.283
and how can you treat an illness just by piercing the needle?

252
00:18:53.417 --> 00:18:54.684
It's all so amazing.

253
00:18:54.684 --> 00:18:57.454
- Do you want to hold it yourself? - Sure!

254
00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:04.995
By the way, why do you want to be a doctor?

255
00:19:05.562 --> 00:19:06.963
Who is it that you want to treat?

256
00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.435
- It's my mom. - What?

257
00:19:12.436 --> 00:19:14.037
I heard that your mom passed away.

258
00:19:15.439 --> 00:19:17.274
I mean, people like my mom.

259
00:19:49.406 --> 00:19:50.707
I won't turn my back on you.

260
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:52.976
I will trust you, and wait for you.

261
00:19:53.877 --> 00:19:55.946
I know what kind of a person you are.

262
00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:02.719
- Gosh, what is that? - My goodness!

263
00:20:02.719 --> 00:20:05.155
- Gosh. - Hey! Stop!

264
00:20:05.155 --> 00:20:07.924
- Catch it! - My goodness!

265
00:20:08.191 --> 00:20:09.559
- Goodness! - What is it?

266
00:20:12.562 --> 00:20:14.664
- Goodness, my baby. - Excuse me, ma'am.

267
00:20:14.664 --> 00:20:17.534
You're not allowed to bring a pig to a hospital.

268
00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:21.605
This one is not a pig. He's Bong Sik.

269
00:20:22.005 --> 00:20:24.307
He's that lady's younger son.

270
00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:27.644
Bong Sik, Bong Sik.

271
00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:30.514
She's been waiting for him so much.

272
00:20:30.514 --> 00:20:32.182
What shall we do then? Tell me.

273
00:20:32.182 --> 00:20:34.451
- Goodness! - No! My goodness!

274
00:20:36.987 --> 00:20:38.722
You shouldn't do this.

275
00:20:38.989 --> 00:20:42.192
You're disturbing other patients.

276
00:20:42.259 --> 00:20:43.960
You should take Bong Sik back home, ma'am.

277
00:20:45.862 --> 00:20:49.432
Bong Sik, let's go home and wait for Mom, okay?

278
00:20:49.733 --> 00:20:51.701
- Be careful on your way home. - Okay.

279
00:20:54.037 --> 00:20:58.141
Gosh, Bong Tak. Have you come to see your mom?

280
00:21:01.745 --> 00:21:06.182
Don't forget to come back home. We'll be waiting for you.

281
00:21:08.418 --> 00:21:10.954
Bye, Bong Sik!

282
00:21:11.988 --> 00:21:13.523
- All right. - Come back home!

283
00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:15.759
Yes, I will. Bye.

284
00:21:21.631 --> 00:21:23.533
Did you treat your wound?

285
00:21:25.502 --> 00:21:27.504
If you didn't, I'll do it for you.

286
00:21:27.504 --> 00:21:29.472
I can take care of myself.

287
00:21:29.739 --> 00:21:31.174
I am not a child.

288
00:21:33.109 --> 00:21:34.210
Go in.

289
00:21:35.011 --> 00:21:36.680
I know you're here to see Ms. Kkot Bun.

290
00:22:15.385 --> 00:22:16.786
(What are you doing?)

291
00:22:16.786 --> 00:22:17.954
Dr. Choi, what are you doing?

292
00:22:24.227 --> 00:22:26.162
You're following the precautions, right?

293
00:22:26.696 --> 00:22:28.765
Have you gotten any closer with that mister?

294
00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:30.333
(Have you gotten any closer with that mister?)

295
00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:31.968
(You're taking the medicine in time, right?)

296
00:22:31.968 --> 00:22:34.170
You're taking the medicine in time, right?

297
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.574
(You're taking the medicine in time, right?)

298
00:22:37.574 --> 00:22:38.975
Did you two fight?

299
00:22:38.975 --> 00:22:41.444
(Did you two fight?)

300
00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:43.213
(Did he say that he had a fight with me?)

301
00:22:43.213 --> 00:22:46.249
Did he say that he had a fight with me?

302
00:22:46.249 --> 00:22:50.053
(Did he say that he had a fight with me?)

303
00:22:50.053 --> 00:22:52.389
So I'm right. I was just trying to get an answer out of you.

304
00:22:52.389 --> 00:22:57.293
(So I'm right. I was just trying to get an answer out of you.)

305
00:22:57.293 --> 00:22:58.862
(Don't come to the hospital.)

306
00:22:58.862 --> 00:23:00.697
Don't come to the hospital.

307
00:23:02.165 --> 00:23:03.900
I won't even if you tell me to.

308
00:23:08.705 --> 00:23:10.707
Please give this to Dr. Choi.

309
00:23:11.074 --> 00:23:12.042
Okay.

310
00:23:13.176 --> 00:23:14.811
Where's Dr. Choi?

311
00:23:21.217 --> 00:23:23.553
- Strange seeing you here. - I guess so.

312
00:23:23.553 --> 00:23:26.856
Can you be wandering around during working hours like this?

313
00:23:26.856 --> 00:23:28.224
Can you?

314
00:23:28.224 --> 00:23:29.559
I'm here because my patient canceled the reservation.

315
00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:31.661
That patient made a reservation to see me.

316
00:23:36.366 --> 00:23:38.268
Do you have time this evening?

317
00:23:38.568 --> 00:23:39.569
Why do you...

318
00:23:39.569 --> 00:23:41.638
We didn't get to throw a team dinner since you came.

319
00:23:41.638 --> 00:23:43.673
I thought we could do that tonight.

320
00:23:46.176 --> 00:23:48.178
It's to celebrate your joining our hospital.

321
00:23:49.145 --> 00:23:50.714
I'd really like you to come.

322
00:23:52.482 --> 00:23:53.516
Okay.

323
00:23:58.188 --> 00:24:05.061
(What is a team dinner?)

324
00:24:05.862 --> 00:24:06.863
Well...

325
00:24:07.864 --> 00:24:09.499
What is a team dinner?

326
00:24:17.907 --> 00:24:21.544
It seems like Dr. Heo's voluntary service overseas was fabricated.

327
00:24:21.911 --> 00:24:24.214
There is no such name in that team.

328
00:24:33.757 --> 00:24:36.359
You might get hurt if you try to open any door.

329
00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:38.128
Is there a door you cannot open with your strength?

330
00:24:38.128 --> 00:24:40.363
There are doors you're not allowed to go through.

331
00:24:40.363 --> 00:24:41.965
You can simply come out if you think it is not right.

332
00:24:41.965 --> 00:24:43.733
- That will happen to you soon... - Oh, sorry.

333
00:24:48.872 --> 00:24:49.973
Yes, Director Ma.

334
00:24:50.473 --> 00:24:52.675
Sure, I will be right there.

335
00:25:03.553 --> 00:25:08.424
Chairman Park's son asked for the continuous treatment from you.

336
00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:14.063
The patients know the best just how effective your acupuncture is.

337
00:25:14.764 --> 00:25:17.901
I was worried my plan might go in vain.

338
00:25:18.067 --> 00:25:19.269
I'm glad it didn't.

339
00:25:19.636 --> 00:25:21.771
If this business becomes successful,

340
00:25:21.905 --> 00:25:24.674
your future life will be on track.

341
00:25:29.212 --> 00:25:30.513
7pm tonight.

342
00:25:31.247 --> 00:25:33.249
I'll text you the location.

343
00:25:34.517 --> 00:25:35.518
Bye.

344
00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:42.058
About Chairman Park's son who came in yesterday.

345
00:25:42.058 --> 00:25:45.662
I wonder what his illness is that everyone made a fuss.

346
00:25:45.662 --> 00:25:47.297
They say it's endocarditis.

347
00:25:47.297 --> 00:25:49.165
Endocarditis?

348
00:25:49.632 --> 00:25:53.670
But you ordered to delete the record of his emergency checkup.

349
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:54.804
Oh, that.

350
00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:57.473
Chairman Park asked me for it.

351
00:25:59.409 --> 00:26:00.677
Wait a second.

352
00:26:01.945 --> 00:26:05.048
He asked me to delete the record.

353
00:26:05.048 --> 00:26:07.116
It means that there's something behind this.

354
00:26:10.687 --> 00:26:12.956
The cause of endocarditis is...

355
00:26:14.524 --> 00:26:15.692
So...

356
00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:17.227
did you delete it?

357
00:26:17.994 --> 00:26:19.896
Do you think I deleted it?

358
00:26:19.896 --> 00:26:21.698
I saved it somewhere in secret.

359
00:26:21.698 --> 00:26:23.666
Good job.

360
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.421
It is all done.

361
00:26:45.555 --> 00:26:47.657
This is the end of your acupuncture treatment.

362
00:26:49.225 --> 00:26:51.127
I know it's not done yet.

363
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:54.764
The treatment.

364
00:26:59.168 --> 00:27:00.203
I...

365
00:27:01.871 --> 00:27:03.973
I'll try.

366
00:27:08.444 --> 00:27:09.746
I'll try it.

367
00:27:12.782 --> 00:27:13.983
Stop the car.

368
00:27:14.784 --> 00:27:15.785
Pardon?

369
00:27:16.953 --> 00:27:18.688
Stop the car right now.

370
00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:31.034
What are you doing? Let go!

371
00:27:33.603 --> 00:27:36.606
Step back if you want to save this patient.

372
00:27:39.709 --> 00:27:41.044
Hey. Hey!

373
00:27:44.247 --> 00:27:47.784
Try escaping from my grip on your own if you want.

374
00:27:47.984 --> 00:27:50.453
Let go. Let go of me.

375
00:27:50.887 --> 00:27:53.022
Hey. Get him off me right now.

376
00:27:55.158 --> 00:27:56.159
Why?

377
00:27:56.926 --> 00:27:58.461
Can you not do it by yourself?

378
00:27:59.762 --> 00:28:01.264
Until when...

379
00:28:01.731 --> 00:28:04.934
Until when will you let others...

380
00:28:05.134 --> 00:28:07.470
control your body and mind?

381
00:28:08.171 --> 00:28:10.673
- What? - If you cannot escape now,

382
00:28:11.207 --> 00:28:13.543
you will live this way in the future too.

383
00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.945
You will not be able to see the person you miss.

384
00:28:16.312 --> 00:28:18.381
You will not be able to keep your promise.

385
00:28:18.381 --> 00:28:20.416
What are you talking about?

386
00:28:20.416 --> 00:28:22.251
If you keep on relying on that mere drug,

387
00:28:22.952 --> 00:28:24.887
you will slowly die...

388
00:28:25.221 --> 00:28:26.622
without being able to do anything by yourself.

389
00:28:29.425 --> 00:28:31.194
Do you want to live in regrets...

390
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:34.063
for what you did in the past?

391
00:28:36.265 --> 00:28:38.234
The reason for your living.

392
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.739
Think carefully about that reason.

393
00:28:49.912 --> 00:28:50.980
Please...

394
00:28:52.615 --> 00:28:53.783
call my father.

395
00:29:09.132 --> 00:29:11.034
I don't want to live this way anymore.

396
00:29:11.034 --> 00:29:12.635
Please let me go.

397
00:29:13.703 --> 00:29:15.972
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

398
00:29:16.606 --> 00:29:18.408
You have everything you want.

399
00:29:18.641 --> 00:29:19.642
What more do you want?

400
00:29:19.642 --> 00:29:20.977
Father.

401
00:29:21.778 --> 00:29:23.613
You think money can solve everything?

402
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.315
I can't even protect someone I love.

403
00:29:27.016 --> 00:29:28.951
I miss her so much that I'm going crazy here.

404
00:29:29.385 --> 00:29:31.621
What good is all that money?

405
00:29:32.422 --> 00:29:33.656
Please.

406
00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.758
Trust me.

407
00:29:37.293 --> 00:29:38.895
Please, Father.

408
00:30:06.155 --> 00:30:07.190
Mister.

409
00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:10.226
You look so handsome today as well.

410
00:30:10.226 --> 00:30:11.861
Hi, there.

411
00:30:15.932 --> 00:30:17.166
I'll have the SSC cake.

412
00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:18.167
Sure.

413
00:30:19.135 --> 00:30:22.472
- SSC? - Strawberry chocolate cream cake.

414
00:30:22.472 --> 00:30:23.573
Don't you know?

415
00:30:24.373 --> 00:30:26.375
Then again, you can't even get people's numbers.

416
00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:29.545
Come on. I know how to get people's numbers now.

417
00:30:30.012 --> 00:30:31.314
And I know this cake too.

418
00:30:31.314 --> 00:30:33.616
It is the sweet cake you eat whenever you feel...

419
00:30:33.616 --> 00:30:37.353
It's best to have sweet cake whenever you're down.

420
00:30:37.887 --> 00:30:39.455
You're right.

421
00:30:42.525 --> 00:30:43.793
Goodness.

422
00:30:44.527 --> 00:30:46.562
I knew it.

423
00:30:47.063 --> 00:30:48.064
Hold on.

424
00:30:51.234 --> 00:30:52.635
I'll pay with this.

425
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:55.004
Thank you for your order.

426
00:30:56.005 --> 00:30:57.607
How did you do that?

427
00:30:58.474 --> 00:30:59.909
Can I do it with mine?

428
00:30:59.976 --> 00:31:01.344
Do I just hold this out?

429
00:31:01.344 --> 00:31:02.612
Goodness.

430
00:31:06.816 --> 00:31:07.884
Is it delicious?

431
00:31:08.551 --> 00:31:11.053
This is it. The sweet and sour taste.

432
00:31:11.687 --> 00:31:14.257
It's best to have something sweet when you feel down.

433
00:31:14.457 --> 00:31:15.491
Try some.

434
00:31:15.491 --> 00:31:17.360
No, I am fine.

435
00:31:20.663 --> 00:31:23.032
- Open your mouth. - I am okay.

436
00:31:23.032 --> 00:31:24.700
Hurry up and eat. Open your mouth.

437
00:31:33.042 --> 00:31:34.043
Isn't it good?

438
00:31:35.778 --> 00:31:37.013
It is good.

439
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.082
It makes me feel better.

440
00:31:40.283 --> 00:31:43.452
Will it make me feel a lot better if I eat a lot?

441
00:31:45.988 --> 00:31:48.958
Let us fly the sky today.

442
00:31:57.667 --> 00:31:59.435
It is working.

443
00:32:09.412 --> 00:32:10.446
Look here.

444
00:32:14.417 --> 00:32:15.952
Oh, my.

445
00:32:16.219 --> 00:32:18.654
Why did you make a face like this?

446
00:32:19.188 --> 00:32:21.190
I did not know that you used that thing like that.

447
00:32:21.357 --> 00:32:24.594
Gosh. Can't you be more photogenic?

448
00:32:27.129 --> 00:32:28.464
This is nice.

449
00:32:34.604 --> 00:32:37.306
You're looking at me like that again.

450
00:32:41.544 --> 00:32:44.013
It is because you remind me of someone.

451
00:32:45.281 --> 00:32:47.450
Who? Your daughter?

452
00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:49.518
I do not have a daughter.

453
00:32:50.286 --> 00:32:52.688
I am still young. Do not say that.

454
00:32:53.356 --> 00:32:54.824
Then who is it?

455
00:32:59.962 --> 00:33:02.632
There is a child who I could not keep a promise with.

456
00:33:07.503 --> 00:33:09.205
Please live healthily.

457
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.974
What are you talking about?

458
00:33:14.377 --> 00:33:16.879
Why did you fight with Dr. Choi?

459
00:33:18.247 --> 00:33:20.783
Did she tell you that we fought?

460
00:33:21.284 --> 00:33:23.052
Why are you two the same?

461
00:33:23.552 --> 00:33:24.854
What else did she say?

462
00:33:25.888 --> 00:33:27.857
Did I become unlikeable?

463
00:33:27.857 --> 00:33:30.793
I want something.

464
00:33:34.263 --> 00:33:37.333
You do not answer my questions and only say what you want.

465
00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:38.801
You are just the same as someone.

466
00:33:41.537 --> 00:33:44.440
Tell me. I have a lot of money.

467
00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.312
It is very shiny.

468
00:33:49.312 --> 00:33:51.013
It looks very interesting.

469
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:54.717
Please choose some heart shapes for me.

470
00:33:55.718 --> 00:33:56.886
Heart?

471
00:33:57.053 --> 00:33:59.722
Don't you know what a heart is? It's this thing.

472
00:34:01.724 --> 00:34:02.958
Your heart?

473
00:34:04.627 --> 00:34:07.430
When you like someone, your heart races.

474
00:34:07.697 --> 00:34:10.733
Hearts also mean love.

475
00:34:12.935 --> 00:34:14.804
I did not know that it had such a deep meaning.

476
00:34:18.607 --> 00:34:20.042
This is pretty.

477
00:34:23.546 --> 00:34:26.382
This looks like a Buddhist rosary.

478
00:34:27.283 --> 00:34:28.918
That's not how you do it.

479
00:34:29.752 --> 00:34:31.487
Among these hearts,

480
00:34:31.654 --> 00:34:33.622
my heart is the shiniest one.

481
00:34:34.357 --> 00:34:35.758
Then this one is mine.

482
00:34:37.026 --> 00:34:38.961
Can you pack this in a pretty package?

483
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:42.732
Here, give this to Dr. Choi.

484
00:34:45.835 --> 00:34:48.771
Why would you give this to Dr. Choi? This is yours.

485
00:34:48.871 --> 00:34:51.107
It's a gift. Don't you know what a gift is?

486
00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.478
What did I say about going straight?

487
00:34:55.978 --> 00:34:59.382
You should apologize first, and give a heartful gift.

488
00:35:01.717 --> 00:35:03.819
I will buy one right now.

489
00:35:03.819 --> 00:35:05.488
Seriously.

490
00:35:05.488 --> 00:35:08.858
I'm okay, so give this to her and apologize.

491
00:35:08.858 --> 00:35:11.260
Make some progress, okay?

492
00:35:11.994 --> 00:35:13.162
I'm going.

493
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.665
Do not run so fast.

494
00:35:17.433 --> 00:35:19.602
I'm okay now.

495
00:35:19.835 --> 00:35:22.004
Please tell her about my heart.

496
00:35:28.644 --> 00:35:30.880
I told her to not run like that.

497
00:35:42.792 --> 00:35:44.293
A heart.

498
00:36:48.958 --> 00:36:50.993
I'm here because someone wanted to see me.

499
00:36:51.961 --> 00:36:53.896
Are you Dr. Choi?

500
00:36:57.566 --> 00:36:59.935
Yes, I am. Who are you?

501
00:36:59.935 --> 00:37:02.738
Please treat my son well.

502
00:37:03.172 --> 00:37:04.206
What?

503
00:37:06.509 --> 00:37:09.512
He won't listen to me when I told him to go to the VIP ward.

504
00:37:09.812 --> 00:37:12.481
I don't know why he insists.

505
00:37:12.648 --> 00:37:14.884
He kept talking strangely about hearts and minds.

506
00:37:14.884 --> 00:37:18.754
I don't know how his acupuncture affected my son.

507
00:37:25.127 --> 00:37:26.896
Doctor.

508
00:37:26.896 --> 00:37:28.264
What happened?

509
00:37:29.064 --> 00:37:30.833
How did you come back?

510
00:37:30.833 --> 00:37:34.436
Dr. Heo said that I had to go back to you.

511
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.873
He said that you were an excellent doctor.

512
00:37:42.645 --> 00:37:43.913
Welcome back.

513
00:37:44.647 --> 00:37:46.315
I'll do my best.

514
00:38:37.032 --> 00:38:43.739
- Heo Bong Tak. - Heo Bong Tak.

515
00:38:43.739 --> 00:38:45.174
("Chilgapsan")

516
00:38:45.174 --> 00:38:46.275
Heo...

517
00:38:47.376 --> 00:38:48.711
Mother.

518
00:39:03.258 --> 00:39:04.627
Mother.

519
00:39:06.261 --> 00:39:07.463
Are you okay?

520
00:39:21.443 --> 00:39:23.045
I will help you.

521
00:39:23.312 --> 00:39:26.315
- Honey. - Dad.

522
00:39:33.355 --> 00:39:36.291
- Cheers. - Cheers.

523
00:39:42.164 --> 00:39:45.934
Dr. Heo, why are you not drinking at all?

524
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:48.003
Can't you drink?

525
00:39:49.204 --> 00:39:51.874
It is not that I cannot. I will not drink.

526
00:39:52.007 --> 00:39:53.876
Are you afraid of making a mistake?

527
00:39:54.877 --> 00:39:56.045
That is not the case.

528
00:39:56.512 --> 00:39:59.982
An oriental medicine doctor should feel the pulse and check the Qi.

529
00:39:59.982 --> 00:40:03.419
It will be bad if my hands start to tremble.

530
00:40:10.793 --> 00:40:12.294
Dr. Heo.

531
00:40:12.661 --> 00:40:16.432
Did you say that you went to Cambodia to volunteer a year ago?

532
00:40:16.932 --> 00:40:19.034
Cambodia?

533
00:40:19.501 --> 00:40:23.706
Did you go to Angkor Wat?

534
00:40:23.706 --> 00:40:27.876
In the last scene of "In the Mood for Love",

535
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.512
Tony Leung Chiu-wai places a secret message...

536
00:40:30.546 --> 00:40:34.783
on the temple walls and leaves.

537
00:40:35.217 --> 00:40:38.253
I was so moved by that scene.

538
00:40:38.253 --> 00:40:40.589
I have always wanted to go there.

539
00:40:41.623 --> 00:40:42.891
I haven't yet.

540
00:40:46.528 --> 00:40:49.131
Of course, I went there.

541
00:40:49.565 --> 00:40:52.134
There were a lot of pillars and people.

542
00:40:52.835 --> 00:40:54.236
It was very nice.

543
00:40:58.941 --> 00:41:00.142
You're here.

544
00:41:00.542 --> 00:41:01.643
Hello.

545
00:41:04.313 --> 00:41:06.048
This is my friend.

546
00:41:06.048 --> 00:41:10.085
He went with you on the medical volunteer trip to Cambodia.

547
00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:12.588
I called him because I thought Dr. Heo would be happy to see him.

548
00:41:13.522 --> 00:41:16.759
You two also went to the same medical school.

549
00:41:16.792 --> 00:41:19.394
I don't know. It's my first time seeing him.

550
00:41:19.962 --> 00:41:21.163
Do you know me by any chance?

551
00:41:28.237 --> 00:41:29.238
Well...

552
00:41:30.506 --> 00:41:31.607
Well...

553
00:41:33.776 --> 00:41:36.044
- Hello. - No, stay seated.

554
00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:38.313
I don't know if I'm interrupting you.

555
00:41:38.313 --> 00:41:39.715
No way.

556
00:41:39.715 --> 00:41:42.985
I came to give you some money for your team dinner.

557
00:41:43.685 --> 00:41:44.853
Thank you.

558
00:41:45.687 --> 00:41:47.222
- Thank you. - My pleasure.

559
00:41:47.756 --> 00:41:50.392
Who is this guy?

560
00:41:51.026 --> 00:41:52.261
He's new to me.

561
00:41:53.796 --> 00:41:56.231
He went to the same college as Dr. Heo's.

562
00:41:56.231 --> 00:41:59.168
He did the voluntary service in Cambodia too, so I invited him.

563
00:41:59.168 --> 00:42:00.936
So that they can catch up.

564
00:42:00.936 --> 00:42:02.004
I see.

565
00:42:03.105 --> 00:42:06.942
Then you must've taken lectures of Professor Lee Sung Hyun.

566
00:42:06.942 --> 00:42:07.943
Yes.

567
00:42:08.877 --> 00:42:11.880
He's the person who wrote Dr. Heo's recommendation.

568
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.682
- Is that right? - Yes.

569
00:42:13.682 --> 00:42:15.384
We had many students in our class.

570
00:42:15.384 --> 00:42:17.186
That must be why I couldn't recognize you.

571
00:42:17.686 --> 00:42:18.754
It's nice to meet you.

572
00:42:28.764 --> 00:42:30.332
What were you trying to do?

573
00:42:31.166 --> 00:42:32.935
Do you realize what you just did?

574
00:42:32.935 --> 00:42:34.236
Then what about you?

575
00:42:35.704 --> 00:42:37.472
Do you realize what you're doing?

576
00:42:37.472 --> 00:42:39.508
What do you mean?

577
00:42:41.143 --> 00:42:43.111
You fabricated that man's background.

578
00:42:46.548 --> 00:42:49.251
I know that you're working on a business in Gyeongin-si.

579
00:42:49.585 --> 00:42:51.687
You're contacting people with high ranks to gain support.

580
00:42:52.487 --> 00:42:54.590
By doing something you shouldn't do as a doctor.

581
00:42:55.757 --> 00:42:58.093
Jae Ha, I'm not doing this to satisfy my greed...

582
00:42:58.093 --> 00:43:00.062
when I'm at this age.

583
00:43:00.062 --> 00:43:01.763
Don't you know it'll all go to you in the future?

584
00:43:01.763 --> 00:43:04.299
Don't use my name as an excuse to cover your desire.

585
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:08.337
It'll be over next month.

586
00:43:09.338 --> 00:43:10.772
Don't mess up with...

587
00:43:11.707 --> 00:43:12.741
Bong Tak until then.

588
00:43:14.142 --> 00:43:15.344
What if I do?

589
00:43:16.812 --> 00:43:18.046
Will you...

590
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.482
frame me and kick me out like you did to my dad?

591
00:43:20.682 --> 00:43:21.683
What?

592
00:43:22.718 --> 00:43:24.052
How did you...

593
00:43:25.087 --> 00:43:27.756
- Where did you hear such... - It won't be the same.

594
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.858
Like you said,

595
00:43:30.859 --> 00:43:32.494
I'm different from my dad.

596
00:44:09.965 --> 00:44:11.133
Okay?

597
00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:13.302
Apologize first.

598
00:44:13.302 --> 00:44:15.337
Make sure you prepare a gift to give her when you apologize.

599
00:44:34.756 --> 00:44:37.893
- Ha Ra. - A pedestrian found her on a road.

600
00:44:37.893 --> 00:44:40.295
She was found late as she was unconscious in a remote alley.

601
00:44:40.295 --> 00:44:42.564
Her pulse rate and blood pressure are very high.

602
00:44:43.732 --> 00:44:44.733
Ha Ra.

603
00:44:45.434 --> 00:44:47.836
Ha Ra, pull yourself together.

604
00:44:59.548 --> 00:45:00.582
Ha Ra.

605
00:45:16.098 --> 00:45:17.866
Something's collected in her heart.

606
00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.169
Her hemoglobin level is low at five.

607
00:45:21.169 --> 00:45:23.138
It must be due to the bleeding in her heart.

608
00:45:23.672 --> 00:45:25.741
We're going to the operating room. Hold it.

609
00:45:34.716 --> 00:45:36.885
Can you feel my heart...

610
00:45:37.452 --> 00:45:38.653
you fixed for me?

611
00:45:40.422 --> 00:45:42.557
Will it be okay to operate on her?

612
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:44.426
Of course.

613
00:45:45.427 --> 00:45:46.695
Stay focused.

614
00:45:46.762 --> 00:45:47.763
Okay.

615
00:46:02.878 --> 00:46:05.914
The patient was found too late, so her heart has been pressed a lot.

616
00:46:06.081 --> 00:46:07.983
Her blood pressure will drop lower if we take much time on anesthesia.

617
00:46:07.983 --> 00:46:10.018
It might cause a cardiac arrest. We better hurry up.

618
00:46:10.018 --> 00:46:11.019
Scalpel.

619
00:46:15.023 --> 00:46:16.024
Suction.

620
00:46:17.192 --> 00:46:18.193
Gauze.

621
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.036
- No. - Please stay in the waiting room.

622
00:46:28.036 --> 00:46:29.971
Let me go in.

623
00:46:30.105 --> 00:46:31.106
I...

624
00:46:31.406 --> 00:46:33.642
I am that girl's friend.

625
00:46:33.642 --> 00:46:35.944
Please let me in.

626
00:46:35.944 --> 00:46:37.846
I will stay quiet.

627
00:46:43.151 --> 00:46:44.219
What is the problem?

628
00:46:46.354 --> 00:46:47.456
What is wrong?

629
00:46:47.456 --> 00:46:49.991
Where we operated on last time looks fine.

630
00:46:50.025 --> 00:46:52.094
There isn't any bleeding in the cannulation site.

631
00:46:52.394 --> 00:46:54.696
The pulmonary artery ligation site looks fine.

632
00:46:55.997 --> 00:46:57.432
There's nothing except for...

633
00:46:57.499 --> 00:46:59.835
the bleeding around the sternum and adipose tissue.

634
00:46:59.835 --> 00:47:00.936
Then what is the problem?

635
00:47:00.936 --> 00:47:02.003
I think...

636
00:47:02.571 --> 00:47:05.107
it's a delayed bleeding caused by anticoagulant.

637
00:47:06.074 --> 00:47:08.543
We'll stop the bleeding and suture first.

638
00:47:08.577 --> 00:47:09.678
Bovie, please.

639
00:47:17.886 --> 00:47:20.355
Ha Ra! Do you hear me?

640
00:47:20.956 --> 00:47:22.724
Remember what I said.

641
00:47:23.024 --> 00:47:25.527
It is your will to survive.

642
00:47:25.527 --> 00:47:27.062
Do not give up on your will.

643
00:47:27.062 --> 00:47:29.264
They'll be distracted if you keep on doing this.

644
00:47:29.364 --> 00:47:30.365
Let's report him.

645
00:47:30.365 --> 00:47:32.467
What are you doing?

646
00:47:32.934 --> 00:47:34.236
Fight back.

647
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:36.605
You must fight.

648
00:47:37.572 --> 00:47:38.607
Please...

649
00:47:39.841 --> 00:47:43.278
You must live healthy.

650
00:47:45.547 --> 00:47:46.581
Ha Ra...

651
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:50.752
Ha Ra.

652
00:48:00.729 --> 00:48:01.730
It's done.

653
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:04.533
We stopped the bleeding now.

654
00:48:04.633 --> 00:48:07.102
I will start the final stitch now.

655
00:48:07.669 --> 00:48:08.670
Wait.

656
00:48:09.905 --> 00:48:11.106
Just 10 seconds.

657
00:48:13.275 --> 00:48:15.043
Let's watch for 10 more seconds.

658
00:48:15.544 --> 00:48:16.545
Okay.

659
00:48:33.461 --> 00:48:34.462
It's cardiac arrest.

660
00:48:37.332 --> 00:48:38.533
Bring the defibrillator.

661
00:48:38.533 --> 00:48:39.601
The defibrillator.

662
00:48:44.873 --> 00:48:46.074
It's cardiac arrest.

663
00:48:47.542 --> 00:48:48.710
What is that?

664
00:48:51.079 --> 00:48:53.081
Her heart is stopping from beating.

665
00:48:56.918 --> 00:48:58.553
Charge 17J. Shock.

666
00:49:01.022 --> 00:49:02.524
Charge 20J.

667
00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:04.492
Shock.

668
00:49:06.261 --> 00:49:08.029
Charge 30J. Shock.

669
00:49:25.113 --> 00:49:26.448
No, Ha Ra.

670
00:49:27.649 --> 00:49:29.317
Ha Ra, please come back.

671
00:49:30.652 --> 00:49:33.321
Please, Ha Ra. This isn't right.

672
00:50:16.197 --> 00:50:17.532
Dad.

673
00:50:18.033 --> 00:50:19.668
Dad.

674
00:50:20.335 --> 00:50:21.870
Dad.

675
00:50:22.771 --> 00:50:24.272
Dad.

676
00:50:24.639 --> 00:50:26.341
Dad.

677
00:50:26.841 --> 00:50:28.543
Dad.

678
00:50:29.344 --> 00:50:30.879
Dad.

679
00:50:41.823 --> 00:50:44.392
That's enough, Yeon Kyung.

680
00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.494
- Stop. - Let me go.

681
00:50:49.097 --> 00:50:52.067
Get up, please.

682
00:50:54.002 --> 00:50:55.937
Can you feel...

683
00:50:58.206 --> 00:50:59.541
the heart you fixed for me?

684
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.295
Yeon Kyung.

685
00:52:02.437 --> 00:52:04.072
15-year-old female patient,

686
00:52:05.373 --> 00:52:06.674
Oh Ha Ra,

687
00:52:09.878 --> 00:52:11.045
has passed away...

688
00:52:15.116 --> 00:52:17.018
on September 10,

689
00:52:22.257 --> 00:52:23.591
9:17pm.

690
00:53:13.842 --> 00:53:14.943
Doctor.

691
00:53:15.443 --> 00:53:16.945
What happened to Ha Ra?

692
00:53:33.094 --> 00:53:34.329
I'm sorry.

693
00:53:36.064 --> 00:53:37.632
You're sorry?

694
00:53:39.968 --> 00:53:41.803
The surgery went well.

695
00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:49.444
But she had a sudden cardiac arrest after the surgery.

696
00:53:51.946 --> 00:53:54.449
Despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation,

697
00:54:01.155 --> 00:54:02.590
she did not recover,

698
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.028
and passed away.

699
00:54:11.332 --> 00:54:13.668
Honey. Honey.

700
00:54:14.536 --> 00:54:18.773
Why? I thought you were good at your job.

701
00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.842
I thought you were skillful.

702
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:24.946
Save Ha Ra! Save Ha Ra!

703
00:54:29.951 --> 00:54:31.452
Go back inside.

704
00:54:31.586 --> 00:54:32.820
Go inside!

705
00:54:33.354 --> 00:54:36.257
Ha Ra will come back alive. Go inside!

706
00:54:36.257 --> 00:54:38.893
- Go inside! - Calm down.

707
00:54:48.269 --> 00:54:49.571
Ha Ra.

708
00:54:50.238 --> 00:54:52.974
Ha Ra.

709
00:54:56.377 --> 00:54:58.479
You should take me with you.

710
00:54:58.846 --> 00:55:02.317
You should take me with you, Ha Ra.

711
00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:05.320
I'm sorry.

712
00:55:07.088 --> 00:55:10.391
Take me too, Ha Ra. I want to go too.

713
00:55:11.259 --> 00:55:13.227
Ha Ra!

714
00:55:18.466 --> 00:55:20.535
My baby.

715
00:55:46.027 --> 00:55:47.729
I keep my promises.

716
00:55:50.231 --> 00:55:51.532
My promise to save patients.

717
00:55:52.533 --> 00:55:53.534
That's why...

718
00:55:55.169 --> 00:55:56.971
I became a surgeon.

719
00:56:04.812 --> 00:56:09.017
I want to ride roller coasters with my friends,

720
00:56:10.051 --> 00:56:11.285
and when I grow up,

721
00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.322
I want to dance in clubs.

722
00:56:18.626 --> 00:56:20.628
And I want to have a dream.

723
00:56:32.874 --> 00:56:34.175
I'm sorry I was late.

724
00:56:42.884 --> 00:56:44.786
Can you feel...

725
00:56:47.155 --> 00:56:48.456
the heart you fixed for me?

726
00:56:51.292 --> 00:56:53.494
Your heart feels warm.

727
00:56:56.731 --> 00:56:59.033
Yeon Kyung, he seems all right.

728
00:56:59.133 --> 00:57:01.602
You should stop playing mind games and make a move.

729
00:57:57.191 --> 00:57:58.192
Yes?

730
00:57:58.259 --> 00:58:02.363
Do you remember Chairman Hwang you met a few days ago?

731
00:58:02.396 --> 00:58:05.666
He hurt his back while playing golf today.

732
00:58:06.667 --> 00:58:08.436
I want you to come.

733
00:58:09.337 --> 00:58:13.674
As I told you before, he'd be of help for you in the future.

734
00:58:14.675 --> 00:58:16.611
I'm on my way to the hospital,

735
00:58:16.611 --> 00:58:18.613
so I'll be there in five minutes.

736
00:58:18.746 --> 00:58:19.847
No.

737
00:58:21.015 --> 00:58:22.250
I cannot go there.

738
00:58:23.518 --> 00:58:24.952
I have an important patient here.

739
00:58:24.952 --> 00:58:27.221
What? What are you talking about?

740
00:59:12.233 --> 00:59:14.135
(Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic)

741
00:59:20.708 --> 00:59:22.043
You came home early today.

742
00:59:22.343 --> 00:59:25.646
Did you eat dinner? If you didn't, I'll set the table for you.

743
00:59:25.646 --> 00:59:26.814
You must have really hated...

744
00:59:28.883 --> 00:59:30.818
me until now.

745
00:59:31.185 --> 00:59:33.054
What do you mean?

746
00:59:33.988 --> 00:59:35.556
It would've been hard for you...

747
00:59:36.991 --> 00:59:38.860
to take care of the granddaughter...

748
00:59:39.927 --> 00:59:41.662
that killed your son.

749
00:59:42.363 --> 00:59:44.532
Yeon Kyung.

750
00:59:44.532 --> 00:59:46.901
How funny was it for you...

751
00:59:48.569 --> 00:59:51.239
when that kid said she was going to medical school...

752
00:59:52.206 --> 00:59:54.041
to become a surgeon to save lives?

753
00:59:54.175 --> 00:59:57.144
That's not true.

754
00:59:59.046 --> 01:00:00.615
So that's why.

755
01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:04.018
That's why I was so crazy...

756
01:00:04.585 --> 01:00:07.054
about the life and death of patients.

757
01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:11.292
I didn't know that.

758
01:00:12.693 --> 01:00:14.762
I thought I became an excellent doctor.

759
01:00:14.762 --> 01:00:16.163
Yeon Kyung.

760
01:00:16.397 --> 01:00:19.100
Listen to me.

761
01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:23.304
That's not true.

762
01:00:32.246 --> 01:00:33.848
You were right.

763
01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.352
I don't have any right to be a doctor.

764
01:00:40.488 --> 01:00:41.489
That's why...

765
01:00:43.024 --> 01:00:45.226
I couldn't save a patient that I really had to.

766
01:00:46.761 --> 01:00:48.829
Wait a minute. I have something to tell you.

767
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.351
Yeon Kyung.

768
01:01:11.218 --> 01:01:14.455
Jae Ha, take me to anywhere.

769
01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.746
It's all my karma.

770
01:01:38.813 --> 01:01:40.314
It's my karma.

771
01:01:40.881 --> 01:01:43.884
Yeon Kyung is receiving the punishment...

772
01:01:45.486 --> 01:01:47.989
I should have received as a father.

773
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:49.957
Yes, Father.

774
01:01:50.224 --> 01:01:52.193
It's all my fault.

775
01:01:52.326 --> 01:01:53.928
Yes.

776
01:01:53.928 --> 01:01:56.263
Why you ungrateful...

777
01:02:05.272 --> 01:02:07.408
Yeon Kyung is here.

778
01:02:09.543 --> 01:02:10.911
Do you want to eat chicken with me?

779
01:02:10.911 --> 01:02:12.246
Yes, that sounds good.

780
01:02:12.446 --> 01:02:13.848
Okay, let's go.

781
01:02:18.386 --> 01:02:19.854
Goodness.

782
01:02:50.451 --> 01:02:51.685
Yeon Kyung, do you like it?

783
01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.554
Isn't it good to ride the motorcycle with me?

784
01:02:53.554 --> 01:02:55.156
Yes, it's good.

785
01:02:58.059 --> 01:02:59.727
Dad, my doll fell down.

786
01:02:59.727 --> 01:03:02.363
- Dad, my doll fell down. - Okay.

787
01:03:02.363 --> 01:03:04.799
Wait a minute.

788
01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:07.735
Here.

789
01:03:12.506 --> 01:03:13.707
Yeon Kyung.

790
01:03:14.175 --> 01:03:15.409
I'll get it for you.

791
01:03:15.976 --> 01:03:19.680
Wait for me here. Okay?

792
01:03:19.947 --> 01:03:20.948
Yes.

793
01:03:32.493 --> 01:03:33.561
Yeon Kyung.

794
01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:20.534
Dad.

795
01:05:39.153 --> 01:05:40.487
Dad.

796
01:05:41.222 --> 01:05:42.756
Dad.

797
01:05:51.398 --> 01:05:53.100
Dad.

798
01:05:53.534 --> 01:05:55.402
Dad.

799
01:05:56.904 --> 01:05:58.672
Dad.

800
01:06:08.082 --> 01:06:09.283
Jae Ha.

801
01:06:10.851 --> 01:06:12.286
Can you stop the car?

802
01:06:13.153 --> 01:06:16.090
I can't. I'll stop it a little later.

803
01:06:20.294 --> 01:06:21.762
I need to get off.

804
01:06:30.371 --> 01:06:32.506
Are you okay?

805
01:06:37.177 --> 01:06:38.178
Hey.

806
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:57.631
Dr. Choi.

807
01:06:59.133 --> 01:07:01.302
She said she doesn't want your help.

808
01:07:17.184 --> 01:07:18.185
Yeon Kyung.

809
01:07:57.825 --> 01:08:00.694
(Live Up To Your Name, Dr. Heo)

810
01:08:01.228 --> 01:08:02.596
I will show you...

811
01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:06.700
what I can do in this new world.

812
01:08:08.369 --> 01:08:09.803
Don't avoid me.

813
01:08:09.803 --> 01:08:11.372
Don't run away from me.

814
01:08:16.076 --> 01:08:19.747
What if I Iose a patient at a very critical moment?

815
01:08:22.116 --> 01:08:24.451
Can I continue being a doctor?
