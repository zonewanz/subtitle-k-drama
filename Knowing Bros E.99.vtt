2
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:15.250
(The autumn wind has gotten
much colder)

3
00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.414
(Everyone should be careful
not to get sick!)

4
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:20.742
I didn't know you were that sickly,
Hee-chul.

5
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.242
(Kim Hee-chul, still suffering from
car accident 11 years ago)

6
00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:27.546
- Careful not to catch a cold.
- You caught a cold?

7
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:31.195
Hee-chul's definitely a pro, he finished
shooting despite having high fever.

8
00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:33.561
(I must've lost my mind!)

9
00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:35.531
(What was that?)

10
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:39.007
(He comes to school without
yelling this time)

11
00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:41.375
That was a nice meal!

12
00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:43.617
Why do you always act when you come?

13
00:00:43.703 --> 00:00:45.375
"The food for your soul"?

14
00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:47.289
They say books are food for soul.

15
00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:49.898
Do you hear it? I'm gaining weight
in my heart.

16
00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:53.058
No, just gaining weight physically.

17
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.632
You have no other body parts to gain
weight in, so you do that to your heart?

18
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:57.937
I told you before, right?

19
00:00:57.968 --> 00:01:00.593
You lose your way in life if you
don't read!

20
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.859
But you got lost so many times!

21
00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:06.039
I told you, books are a navigation
in your life!

22
00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:08.085
I heard you're bad with directions.

23
00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:10.859
Ho-dong brought a really thick
book last time.

24
00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:13.195
I saw him, but he just kept reading
the preface.

25
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:14.460
With a bookmark!

26
00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:15.851
And he used it as a pillow.

27
00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:16.883
But these days...

28
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:21.335
- I  heard all he does is to read.
- Who said that?

29
00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:22.959
There are rumors.

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.632
That's my brother talking,
a fellow athlete.

31
00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:28.148
"Che-dong!" [acronym]

32
00:01:28.173 --> 00:01:30.851
That stands for "my athlete brother"!

33
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.203
Go ahead and continue.

34
00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.445
I heard from many people that
he's been reading a lot.

35
00:01:35.508 --> 00:01:36.718
False rumors.

36
00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:37.921
He said he heard it.

37
00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:42.628
I also heard it's because his son Si-hoo
thinks he's dumb.

38
00:01:42.648 --> 00:01:45.117
Si-hoo thinks his dad doesn't
know anything.

39
00:01:46.797 --> 00:01:48.390
It's about that age he starts
to ask questions.

40
00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:51.007
Ho-dong's so shocked by it that he
started reading a lot.

41
00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:53.546
Hee-chul, you don't read either, do you?

42
00:01:53.593 --> 00:01:56.193
What's the last book you read recently?

43
00:01:56.703 --> 00:01:58.632
That's why you've got no girlfriend!

44
00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:01.484
Is that why?

45
00:02:01.508 --> 00:02:03.992
It's totally empty up here, that's why!

46
00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:07.117
It doesn't matter how good-looking
you are, it's what's inside that counts.

47
00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:09.882
Wait, it's making me even more mad
that it might be true.

48
00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:12.414
I can't deny what he's saying.

49
00:02:12.422 --> 00:02:14.304
What book is that? Why'd you bring it?

50
00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.960
That's the only book you've read, right?

51
00:02:16.977 --> 00:02:19.312
What other books have you read recently?

52
00:02:19.387 --> 00:02:21.523
You read a restaurant menu
yesterday.

53
00:02:21.548 --> 00:02:22.898
It was well-written.

54
00:02:22.922 --> 00:02:24.367
He memorized it.

55
00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:28.085
Let's name books that we liked.

56
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:29.687
I'll go first.

57
00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:31.968
"Walden" by Henry David Thoreau.

58
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:33.500
It's a must-read!

59
00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:35.625
- Henry wrote it?
- Henry David Thoreau.

60
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.968
He was a Harvard professor, the book's
500 pages long.

61
00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:40.055
Let's stop now.

62
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:41.445
My head hurts.

63
00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:43.867
(Dizzy from the English title)

64
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:46.820
It's the most-sold book in America,
other than the Bible.

65
00:02:46.844 --> 00:02:49.789
- Every household's got one.
- What about you, Sang-min?

66
00:02:51.406 --> 00:02:54.054
The book I read recently was...

67
00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:57.164
"Do you want to own a house?
Or rent?"

68
00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:59.093
(Sad that it's so realistic)

69
00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:01.078
Isn't that a real estate pamphlet?

70
00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:07.039
It explains if one should buy a house or
rent instead, and invest elsewhere.

71
00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:10.257
It does a really good job
and comparing the two options.

72
00:03:10.304 --> 00:03:12.429
Have you been featured in a book?

73
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:14.921
Have you been mentioned in
a book title?

74
00:03:14.953 --> 00:03:16.742
I've been in the content of a book before.

75
00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:18.367
Really? Why?

76
00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.320
Lee Soo-man wrote a book before,
and he mentioned my name.

77
00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:22.312
- He wrote about you?
- Yeah.

78
00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:24.375
- That happened to me too!
- How?

79
00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:27.710
What was it called, "Love is..."

80
00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:29.566
"Love is a mean butterfly"?

81
00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:32.000
(A song released in 1983)

82
00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:35.781
(Can't quite remember)

83
00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:39.132
(He was mentioned in a book called
"Eun-gyo" before)

84
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.500
The characters of the book are watching
TV and they talk about me.

85
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:46.585
I get confused about the title though.

86
00:03:46.641 --> 00:03:50.164
I was once on a cover of a magazine,
every month!

87
00:03:50.742 --> 00:03:52.085
As a cover story!

88
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:53.359
(Wrestling Monthly)

89
00:03:56.952 --> 00:03:59.875
(A super model in the field of wrestling)

90
00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:02.684
Have you heard of "Jump Ball"?

91
00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:06.491
(He was also famous
in a basketball magazine)

92
00:04:06.615 --> 00:04:09.295
(Everyone's talking about how they were
featured on magazine covers)

93
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.898
(An actress famous for being sweet,
Lee Ha-nui!)

94
00:04:16.363 --> 00:04:17.963
Hello!

95
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.375
Isn't that Lee Ha-nui?

96
00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:22.859
Miss Korea!

97
00:04:23.452 --> 00:04:26.171
(A Miss Universe comes to school today)

98
00:04:31.514 --> 00:04:34.101
(A customized welcome song for Lee Ha-nui)

99
00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:36.328
Hello, I'm from...

100
00:04:36.648 --> 00:04:40.609
"The Brothers Wanted to See Me
So Badly" high school.

101
00:04:40.688 --> 00:04:43.492
I'm Lee Ha-nui, pretty just by breathing.

102
00:04:43.823 --> 00:04:46.187
(A huge smile)

103
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:48.195
Jang-hoon's got a huge smile on his face.

104
00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:49.999
Let me tell you something.

105
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.476
The production staff should
really thank me.

106
00:04:53.508 --> 00:04:55.148
You got her to come on the show?

107
00:04:55.188 --> 00:04:56.788
Enough already.

108
00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.671
The show staff have been trying to
get Lee Ha-nui to come on the show.

109
00:05:00.703 --> 00:05:03.484
And they asked me to help, to give
her a call.

110
00:05:03.555 --> 00:05:07.671
So I talked to her on the phone
for an hour and a half.

111
00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:10.085
- You convinced her?
- I did.

112
00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:14.058
That's why she came on the show,
because of my phone call.

113
00:05:14.124 --> 00:05:18.179
But you told them not to have
Jang Yun-jeong on the show?

114
00:05:19.227 --> 00:05:22.070
I couldn't come on the show
because of a certain person here.

115
00:05:22.102 --> 00:05:24.421
Because of him, Jang-hoon.

116
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:27.898
He said, "Only girl-groups
come on the show."

117
00:05:29.513 --> 00:05:32.007
He had told Jang Yun-jeong she
shouldn't come on the show.

118
00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:35.453
What percentage would you say
his phone call played a factor?

119
00:05:35.516 --> 00:05:38.132
I'd say about...

120
00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.359
About 60%.

121
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.367
It's because...

122
00:05:42.516 --> 00:05:45.585
He called me really late at night,
it was early morning.

123
00:05:45.648 --> 00:05:48.804
He asked what stops me from
coming on the show.

124
00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:51.156
I told him I was a little scared, and he
said,

125
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.046
"I'm here, you got nothing to worry about."

126
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.914
(Thank you, the heart-throb giant!)

127
00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:03.835
(Now he feels embarrassed)

128
00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:06.304
He's feeling so shy right now.

129
00:06:07.212 --> 00:06:10.171
I can't believe I told her that,
I was just so pressured.

130
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.585
I'm sure you talked to her for so long
that she was just fed up.

131
00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:16.671
An hour and a half on the phone?

132
00:06:16.703 --> 00:06:19.289
60% is a lot though.

133
00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:24.765
We used to be on the same show together
when I first started to be on TV.

134
00:06:24.805 --> 00:06:29.421
We'd spend 45 days straight
to shoot an episode, for 6 months.

135
00:06:29.703 --> 00:06:32.429
I heard about this survey
that Lee Ha-nui won.

136
00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:35.437
She looks the most different after
putting on her makeup.

137
00:06:36.088 --> 00:06:38.773
No one would recognize her if she
didn't wear her makeup,

138
00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:41.671
no matter how big of a scene
she might cause.

139
00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:44.164
She looks like a completely
different person!

140
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.656
Why didn't you put on your makeup today?

141
00:06:46.681 --> 00:06:50.337
Jang-hoon must've seen her
without makeup.

142
00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:53.421
She doesn't look that different,
not so extreme.

143
00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:56.039
I still look cute and pretty
without makeup on.

144
00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:59.015
(Embarrassed)

145
00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.828
She just looks a little younger
without it.

146
00:07:02.161 --> 00:07:05.710
If I can compare your face
to an animal, as people often do...

147
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:08.961
You think you got a dog face (Kye-sang)?
Or a cat face?

148
00:07:09.063 --> 00:07:10.320
I think a pig face.

149
00:07:10.344 --> 00:07:12.781
(Failed to make fun of her about
her boyfriend)

150
00:07:13.288 --> 00:07:15.406
I told him not to try it.

151
00:07:15.431 --> 00:07:16.884
He said it on purpose?

152
00:07:16.898 --> 00:07:19.531
I told him not to try it, no one
said anything.

153
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.265
He was just waiting for a chance to
mention his name by himself.

154
00:07:23.836 --> 00:07:26.281
"Kye-sang"? Or a cat face?

155
00:07:27.068 --> 00:07:28.773
Oh, that's what he was saying.

156
00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:31.015
I told him not to mention it!

157
00:07:32.155 --> 00:07:34.429
Doesn't she have a dog face? Like Kye-sang?

158
00:07:34.797 --> 00:07:36.375
(Boiling up in anger)

159
00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:37.648
You have a dog face!

160
00:07:37.672 --> 00:07:39.640
No, not a dog face. More like a cat.

161
00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:42.398
A dog face!

162
00:07:42.547 --> 00:07:44.414
A cat face, I'm telling you.

163
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.820
(I think Kye-sang...)

164
00:07:46.844 --> 00:07:49.906
This is fine, I like this kind of a vibe.
I'm used to it.

165
00:07:49.984 --> 00:07:52.281
I heard she did something amazing
recently.

166
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.101
What was it?

167
00:07:54.296 --> 00:07:57.123
She tried to get on
the Guinness World Records.

168
00:07:57.164 --> 00:08:01.039
She had 100 people play the gayageum
at the same time.

169
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.828
It was 1,000 people.

170
00:08:02.836 --> 00:08:04.890
Wow, 1,000 people?

171
00:08:05.007 --> 00:08:09.539
We tried to have 1,004 people
to be on the Guinness Book.

172
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.429
But more people came than expected.

173
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:16.710
We had almost 1,200 people playing
the gayageum at the same time.

174
00:08:16.727 --> 00:08:18.734
The motivation behind it

175
00:08:18.758 --> 00:08:24.921
was that China tried something similar with
about 800 people playing the gayageum.

176
00:08:25.444 --> 00:08:27.882
But that can raise an issue later
in the future,

177
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:30.226
since it's our own traditional instrument.

178
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.476
My mother actually thought of
doing that first.

179
00:08:33.516 --> 00:08:37.546
Her mother is a Living Human Treasure
for her gayageum performance.

180
00:08:38.036 --> 00:08:41.859
Many people agreed to the idea and intent
behind the performance.

181
00:08:41.898 --> 00:08:44.515
I was very grateful, it was like
a miracle to me.

182
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.898
I see that it's very meaningful.

183
00:08:46.938 --> 00:08:49.914
You know that gayageum sound that comes on
on the train?

184
00:08:49.938 --> 00:08:51.289
That's right.

185
00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:53.781
Isn't that a recording
of your sister playing the gayageum?

186
00:08:53.843 --> 00:08:57.671
It's with my sister, with my mom
and myself playing as an ensemble.

187
00:08:58.742 --> 00:09:01.882
I think of you every time
I get on the train.

188
00:09:03.398 --> 00:09:05.445
(Embarrassed)

189
00:09:05.648 --> 00:09:07.781
I heard you're learning it again
from your mother?

190
00:09:08.203 --> 00:09:10.960
I played it since I was 4, for about
20 years.

191
00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:14.820
More than 20 years, 20 to 30 years.

192
00:09:14.844 --> 00:09:16.444
Wow, since she was 4!

193
00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:18.921
It's got a very special place
in my heart.

194
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:22.710
It's not just about playing a musical
instrument or a hobby, or a career.

195
00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:24.484
It's life itself to you.

196
00:09:24.523 --> 00:09:26.265
You can say that.

197
00:09:26.492 --> 00:09:28.750
I want to see her play it.

198
00:09:28.906 --> 00:09:30.507
Let's hear her play the gayageum!

199
00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:33.507
A lot of people watch this show
overseas too.

200
00:09:33.593 --> 00:09:36.753
It's actually less interesting if you
show it, the viewers might look it up more

201
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:39.414
if they're more frustrated from
not seeing you play.

202
00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:41.851
(Teasing over the gayageum)

203
00:09:42.078 --> 00:09:43.678
(Her own gayageum)

204
00:09:44.406 --> 00:09:46.820
Isn't this the highest level of
playing the gayageum?

205
00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:49.038
You hit it like this and swords
come flying out of it?

206
00:09:49.063 --> 00:09:50.663
Like in a kung fu movie!

207
00:09:50.838 --> 00:09:52.998
(We can see it in real life!)

208
00:09:53.063 --> 00:09:56.460
This one's got 12 strings.
Some have 24, right?

209
00:09:57.085 --> 00:09:58.648
Have you tried playing one before?

210
00:09:58.672 --> 00:09:59.554
No, never.

211
00:09:59.563 --> 00:10:01.117
It's hard to get one, actually.

212
00:10:01.148 --> 00:10:03.117
I'll teach you how to play "Arirang."

213
00:10:03.466 --> 00:10:05.960
- I get to learn it?
- Hee-chul, sit here.

214
00:10:07.976 --> 00:10:09.312
No, sit here.

215
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:14.046
(An embarrassing moment
for the Big Star of the Universe)

216
00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:16.500
You looked totally ignorant.

217
00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:19.867
(I thought they sit in the middle
in the movies!)

218
00:10:22.408 --> 00:10:25.062
I saw it in Kung Fu Hustle!

219
00:10:25.354 --> 00:10:27.354
It looked respectful, it's OK.

220
00:10:28.492 --> 00:10:30.375
Sit here, like this.

221
00:10:30.469 --> 00:10:32.304
Hee-chul looks so womanly.

222
00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.500
It suits him.

223
00:10:36.685 --> 00:10:41.890
Left hand out straight, like a seagull
flying in the air.

224
00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:45.234
Just put it over the strings.

225
00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:49.554
And the right hand on top of this.

226
00:10:49.602 --> 00:10:52.289
Imagine holding an egg.

227
00:10:52.398 --> 00:10:53.968
Fold your fingers like that.

228
00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:56.078
Just like that!

229
00:10:58.392 --> 00:10:59.765
(Getting into it)

230
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:02.359
You've got a lot of passion.

231
00:11:03.015 --> 00:11:05.320
(Learning how to play Arirang)

232
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:10.054
(Intense focus)

233
00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:14.515
(A simple melody)

234
00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:18.382
(Yet it's beautiful and grabs
everyone's attention)

235
00:11:21.126 --> 00:11:22.835
Don't press anything there?

236
00:11:38.827 --> 00:11:40.804
(A private lesson by Ha-nui ends)

237
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.976
(Hee-chul's now playing it on his own!)

238
00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:50.447
Genius!

239
00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.679
Try following along with the left hand.

240
00:11:55.168 --> 00:11:56.382
(To a perfect finish)

241
00:11:58.202 --> 00:12:01.195
(Great job, Hee-chul!)

242
00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:03.343
(Amazed)

243
00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:07.070
(Can't believe it's his first time!)

244
00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:09.609
(Embarrassed)

245
00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:12.479
It would've been great if he joined
us for the Guinness Book challenge.

246
00:12:13.226 --> 00:12:15.499
(It's so unlike him to blush)

247
00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:18.468
(Everyone compliments him)

248
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.179
(Hides behind the giant)

249
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.554
- Don't compliment me so much.
- What a musician!

250
00:12:23.828 --> 00:12:25.921
(Then we'll compliment you even more!)

251
00:12:27.326 --> 00:12:29.617
I'm allergic to being complimented.

252
00:12:30.369 --> 00:12:32.757
(Time to listen to Ha-nui's
gayageum performance)

253
00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:36.343
I heard it sounds the best for
the person who's playing it.

254
00:12:36.368 --> 00:12:39.078
She's the closest person
to the instrument.

255
00:12:43.514 --> 00:12:47.500
(A beautiful melody comes as soon
as she touches the strings)

256
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:51.859
She's tuning.

257
00:12:51.989 --> 00:12:53.484
That's completely true!

258
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:57.876
The process is called "Dasereum,"
like controlling the notes.

259
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.500
We should call it that instead of
the word, "tuning."

260
00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:08.023
Even at the plastic surgery place,
"I'm here for a dasereum."

261
00:13:08.117 --> 00:13:10.757
"Yes, you need it all over your face!"

262
00:13:10.828 --> 00:13:12.929
"Where would you like to be
dasereum'd?"

263
00:13:12.977 --> 00:13:15.687
- "My nose, a little."
- "Dasereum your nose?"

264
00:13:16.637 --> 00:13:20.015
I like the slow songs more, actually.

265
00:13:20.078 --> 00:13:22.484
- Go ahead!
- Slow songs are great!

266
00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:24.531
But people don't like the slow songs.

267
00:13:24.547 --> 00:13:26.039
No, we'd like it.

268
00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:28.132
(Do what you want!)

269
00:13:28.157 --> 00:13:31.023
Well, it takes an hour to finish the song.

270
00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:32.953
I don't about an hour.

271
00:13:32.987 --> 00:13:35.132
Yeah, I figured.

272
00:13:35.191 --> 00:13:38.000
You can do that for an Internet show.

273
00:13:38.352 --> 00:13:41.179
We can release it separately online,
an hour-long clip.

274
00:13:41.227 --> 00:13:43.453
Let's see who wins, us or the viewers.

275
00:13:43.478 --> 00:13:45.945
We have a set time to shoot this show.

276
00:13:47.322 --> 00:13:48.945
I got it.

277
00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:50.750
(She starts to play)

278
00:13:58.096 --> 00:14:00.273
(Her hands move like they're dancing)

279
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.920
(With fine and detailed sounds)

280
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.570
(Getting into it)

281
00:14:14.546 --> 00:14:19.882
(A beautiful melody of gayageum,
perfect for an autumn evening)

282
00:14:21.096 --> 00:14:22.484
I'll stop here.

283
00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:25.640
(Everyone's amazed)

284
00:14:26.659 --> 00:14:28.459
(Can't help but to applaud)

285
00:14:28.484 --> 00:14:31.164
It's the left hand that really
moves a person's heart.

286
00:14:31.398 --> 00:14:34.531
Ho-dong, you really hit it
right on the point.

287
00:14:36.735 --> 00:14:41.117
This very Korean-feel of sounds
come from the left hand.

288
00:14:44.123 --> 00:14:49.820
(Sounds come in a variety of colors
as the left hand presses on the strings)

289
00:14:51.049 --> 00:14:52.859
It's truly amazing.

290
00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:58.726
Hee-chul was really good too, I know
he's good with musical instruments.

291
00:15:00.481 --> 00:15:02.109
So you studied Korean traditional music?

292
00:15:02.141 --> 00:15:03.843
I did, for a long time.

293
00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:05.695
I went to graduate school for it.

294
00:15:05.703 --> 00:15:07.132
She majored in it.

295
00:15:07.148 --> 00:15:08.757
Bring out what you filled out.

296
00:15:08.773 --> 00:15:10.804
Oh yes, I filled it out.

297
00:15:11.915 --> 00:15:14.062
(A famous Korean traditional song)

298
00:15:16.477 --> 00:15:19.039
Name: Lee Ha-nui.

299
00:15:19.195 --> 00:15:22.390
It's the name of a type of a wind, right?

300
00:15:22.817 --> 00:15:27.281
Yes, they say "ha-nui wind" gather fish
for the people. It's a good wind.

301
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:31.687
You should shoot a TV commercial
for an air filter, for good wind.

302
00:15:31.758 --> 00:15:33.914
"Ha-nui wind" means "a good wind"?

303
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:38.546
It's really for the fishermen, I wondered
if I had to marry a fisherman.

304
00:15:39.514 --> 00:15:41.960
Her name's got an awesome meaning.

305
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.476
From: "The Brothers Wanted to See Me
So Badly" high school."

306
00:15:46.102 --> 00:15:48.398
"Brother"? Isn't that the name of...

307
00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:50.601
Yes, I'm in a movie called "Brother."

308
00:15:50.648 --> 00:15:52.109
That's why you're here?

309
00:15:52.148 --> 00:15:55.679
- With Ma Dong-Seok?
- Yes, and with Lee Dong-hwi.

310
00:15:55.704 --> 00:15:57.625
It reminds me of "New World," the movie.

311
00:15:57.734 --> 00:16:00.281
It's our name too, "the Knowing Brothers."

312
00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:03.578
Isn't that our English name for the show?

313
00:16:05.647 --> 00:16:07.937
(Got it)

314
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.671
You couldn't understand our English?

315
00:16:09.703 --> 00:16:12.413
I thought you said, "Elderly Brothers."

316
00:16:12.617 --> 00:16:15.656
She thought we said, "Elderly Brothers."

317
00:16:18.414 --> 00:16:20.734
It's not totally wrong, actually.

318
00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:23.179
Her future dream is

319
00:16:23.203 --> 00:16:25.437
to be a Gypsy who's free.

320
00:16:25.492 --> 00:16:27.429
"You're a lonely and sad lady."

321
00:16:27.438 --> 00:16:30.320
"Crying without an end, following the
stars during the day."

322
00:16:30.345 --> 00:16:34.585
"Following the flowers at night,
the lonely Gypsy lady."

323
00:16:35.093 --> 00:16:38.187
("A Gypsy Lady," a song released in 1988)

324
00:16:38.469 --> 00:16:42.085
(They play along well with each other)

325
00:16:53.026 --> 00:16:54.710
Oh, that song!

326
00:16:54.757 --> 00:16:56.664
Yes, by Lee Chi-hyun and Friends!

327
00:16:56.703 --> 00:16:58.851
I thought it was a song from a musical.

328
00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:02.281
You really are "the Elderly Brothers."

329
00:17:02.336 --> 00:17:04.960
(Average age: 42)

330
00:17:05.717 --> 00:17:07.468
Is she a lot younger than us?

331
00:17:07.539 --> 00:17:09.203
You don't know this song?

332
00:17:09.227 --> 00:17:11.789
I just know the chorus.

333
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:14.632
- How old are you?
- Same age as you are.

334
00:17:14.686 --> 00:17:16.921
Born in a Year of the Pig?

335
00:17:16.961 --> 00:17:18.828
I wanted to meet Hee-chul because of it.

336
00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.500
- Born in 1984?
- In 1983.

337
00:17:20.555 --> 00:17:22.515
(She looks much more mature
than her age)

338
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.609
She looks her age without makeup,
she looks younger.

339
00:17:26.702 --> 00:17:29.093
But she looks more mature
with makeup on.

340
00:17:29.305 --> 00:17:30.851
She looks young now, too.

341
00:17:30.891 --> 00:17:33.357
Yes, but even younger without makeup.

342
00:17:33.414 --> 00:17:34.867
OK, fine!

343
00:17:35.016 --> 00:17:37.039
(Taken aback)

344
00:17:37.716 --> 00:17:41.218
(Calling over the jib out of embarrassment)

345
00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:43.593
(She feels embarrassed too)

346
00:17:45.188 --> 00:17:51.109
He went around every waiting room to ask
us not to mention Kye-sang.

347
00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.656
He came up to me, too.

348
00:17:55.187 --> 00:17:58.343
"I'm gonna kill you if you mention
anything about Kye-sang."

349
00:17:58.594 --> 00:18:00.265
(Embarrassed)

350
00:18:00.398 --> 00:18:02.695
He was trying to protect her
like she's Psy.

351
00:18:02.726 --> 00:18:06.093
She's a really close friend of mine.

352
00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:09.890
And she came on the show
because I asked her to.

353
00:18:10.304 --> 00:18:11.828
I have to take care of her.

354
00:18:11.853 --> 00:18:14.703
You shouldn't be so calculative
when you're shooting a show.

355
00:18:14.938 --> 00:18:16.679
(I shouldn't have said anything)

356
00:18:16.781 --> 00:18:18.581
This is a very honest show!

357
00:18:19.422 --> 00:18:21.265
Just go with whatever your heart tells you.

358
00:18:21.313 --> 00:18:24.000
Imagine how it was for me, we share
the same waiting room.

359
00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:28.625
She's on his "top three" list, for over
10 different categories!

360
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:32.070
(Everyone's complaining about Jang-hoon's
special treatment for Ha-nui)

361
00:18:32.094 --> 00:18:34.494
I like how Jang-hoon gets like that.

362
00:18:34.945 --> 00:18:39.054
He can be a tough guy, but he can't lie.

363
00:18:39.242 --> 00:18:42.906
I was worried that he might say something
wrong on TV.

364
00:18:43.148 --> 00:18:47.000
It's because I met him when he just
started to be on TV.

365
00:18:47.055 --> 00:18:50.125
He wasn't in a very good condition then.

366
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.875
In many ways!

367
00:18:51.914 --> 00:18:58.320
I was worried how he'd be able to
adjust to his new life as a TV celebrity.

368
00:18:58.633 --> 00:19:01.265
But he turned out really well!

369
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.601
He's totally blossomed in his new career.

370
00:19:04.648 --> 00:19:06.296
I'm so proud of him whenever I see him.

371
00:19:06.344 --> 00:19:09.476
He's well-adjusted on TV shows,
and is also looking for his new love.

372
00:19:09.531 --> 00:19:11.865
I really hope that happens for him.

373
00:19:11.938 --> 00:19:14.140
What kind of a woman will match him well?

374
00:19:14.172 --> 00:19:16.039
Actually, for Jang-hoon...

375
00:19:16.125 --> 00:19:17.984
(Wants to hear something nice)

376
00:19:18.062 --> 00:19:20.500
He should just live alone.

377
00:19:22.744 --> 00:19:25.484
(Applauding at this unexpected twist)

378
00:19:25.509 --> 00:19:27.421
(Consoling him)

379
00:19:28.236 --> 00:19:30.203
She's right, it's true.

380
00:19:30.242 --> 00:19:35.320
I watched him for a long time, we
practically lived together for the show.

381
00:19:36.687 --> 00:19:40.484
There are parts about him that must be
very difficult for a woman to handle.

382
00:19:40.509 --> 00:19:42.875
But they're not something I can criticize
him over.

383
00:19:42.898 --> 00:19:44.498
He's just like that.

384
00:19:44.939 --> 00:19:46.484
(Is that a good thing?)

385
00:19:46.672 --> 00:19:50.742
He's lived that way for 40 years, you can't
just tell him not to be so clean.

386
00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:54.195
"Don't use so many wet wipes," "Stop
nagging," "Don't be so cold..."

387
00:19:54.219 --> 00:19:56.781
You shouldn't tell him those things.

388
00:19:56.929 --> 00:20:00.062
It'll be great if he finds a woman who
can match him.

389
00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:02.070
Someone who won't try to change him.

390
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:02.804
He's got lots of pride.

391
00:20:02.843 --> 00:20:05.937
He needs to marry someone who doesn't
know how he is, outside of Korea.

392
00:20:05.984 --> 00:20:07.812
I... I can take care of myself.

393
00:20:07.883 --> 00:20:10.468
We can visit a foreign country if you
marry a foreigner!

394
00:20:10.492 --> 00:20:15.875
I thought everyone would get scared
when he'd get so serious like this.

395
00:20:15.945 --> 00:20:21.234
It's just here that Jang-hoon gets
treated so miserably like this.

396
00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:23.851
(Miserable)

397
00:20:24.398 --> 00:20:26.000
Her strength is really amazing.

398
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:28.695
I bet no one knows this game in the world.

399
00:20:28.742 --> 00:20:31.375
Her strength is limbo, but...

400
00:20:31.437 --> 00:20:33.343
It's "a conditional limbo."

401
00:20:34.063 --> 00:20:35.445
What do you mean by that?

402
00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:40.335
I wrote that because of Soo-geun
and Jang-hoon.

403
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.960
(Because of us?)

404
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.953
Oh, because of the difference in height.

405
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.726
It should start from where
our belly buttons are,

406
00:20:47.758 --> 00:20:50.007
then go lower by 5 cm each time.

407
00:20:50.047 --> 00:20:53.093
But if we just start at the same height,
it's too hard for Jang-hoon and

408
00:20:53.117 --> 00:20:55.125
it's too easy for Soo-geun.

409
00:20:55.272 --> 00:20:58.117
I go through many difficulties
because I'm short,

410
00:20:58.128 --> 00:20:59.760
I should be at an advantage for
at least this!

411
00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:01.612
Soo-geun, I'm really your fan though.

412
00:21:01.628 --> 00:21:02.628
OK, I agree then.

413
00:21:03.222 --> 00:21:05.667
(She really is a fan of his)

414
00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:09.182
You dance like an old woman,
I've never done that.

415
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.763
(She dances like she's an older woman)

416
00:21:12.132 --> 00:21:14.510
The shoulder-dance is for a different song.

417
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.534
(Many things can be understood
from the shoulder-dance)

418
00:21:19.815 --> 00:21:22.706
You have to be at least in your
mid-30s to dance like that.

419
00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:25.088
You dance like this when you're
in your 40s.

420
00:21:25.112 --> 00:21:27.424
Let's set up this conditional limbo game.

421
00:21:28.312 --> 00:21:30.409
(Conditional limbo match)

422
00:21:30.434 --> 00:21:33.034
(Starting from each person's
belly button height)

423
00:21:33.104 --> 00:21:36.010
Let's start from Jang-hoon's height.

424
00:21:36.393 --> 00:21:39.073
That's where Soo-geun's neck is.

425
00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:41.354
(You can really see
the difference in height)

426
00:21:41.416 --> 00:21:43.494
Wait, Ha-nui!

427
00:21:43.784 --> 00:21:45.565
You're wearing a watch.

428
00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:47.197
She's wearing one!

429
00:21:47.315 --> 00:21:48.518
What brand is it?

430
00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.907
I saw a lot of expensive ones here.

431
00:21:51.175 --> 00:21:52.690
You need to bet your watch.

432
00:21:52.885 --> 00:21:55.174
(Sang-min comes to appraise it)

433
00:21:56.278 --> 00:21:58.049
(It's hard to see...)

434
00:21:58.432 --> 00:22:00.838
He can't see so clearly anymore
from aging.

435
00:22:00.969 --> 00:22:02.542
(Hard to see)

436
00:22:02.558 --> 00:22:04.323
Forget about the watch.

437
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.080
What's your shoe size?

438
00:22:06.222 --> 00:22:07.534
260 mm.

439
00:22:07.573 --> 00:22:09.901
(We'll bet our shoes today)

440
00:22:10.544 --> 00:22:11.877
You fit in them?

441
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.768
(Ha-nui can fit in Soo-geun's shoes
perfectly!)

442
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.206
(How about Ha-nui's shoes?)

443
00:22:18.222 --> 00:22:19.822
(Perfect!)

444
00:22:20.018 --> 00:22:21.956
(How shocking)

445
00:22:22.603 --> 00:22:25.768
(They fit so well)

446
00:22:26.479 --> 00:22:29.510
(They didn't expect to have the
same shoe sizes)

447
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.370
Give up your shoes if you lose.

448
00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:33.112
OK!

449
00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:34.690
You wear size 260?

450
00:22:34.722 --> 00:22:36.417
255 to 260.

451
00:22:36.714 --> 00:22:39.065
(A match over their shoes since
they wear the same size)

452
00:22:39.283 --> 00:22:40.995
She's got huge feet compared to others.

453
00:22:41.011 --> 00:22:43.526
We should start with Jang-hoon,
it's at his height.

454
00:22:43.551 --> 00:22:46.455
There's no way we can beat a girl
when it comes to how flexible we are.

455
00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:48.917
I don't think I can do this,
there's no way.

456
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:50.690
How can I do that?

457
00:22:50.715 --> 00:22:51.901
With the legs first.

458
00:22:51.926 --> 00:22:54.120
Bend your back, then out.

459
00:22:54.299 --> 00:22:57.885
You need to learn how to see the world
from a lower position.

460
00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:00.924
Wow, he's really big from this angle.

461
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:05.620
(Jang-hoon fails on the first level)

462
00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:07.799
There's just no way I can do this.

463
00:23:07.824 --> 00:23:09.526
Let's go in the height order then.

464
00:23:09.565 --> 00:23:12.299
It's possible for Yeong-cheol, he's
got a clean back.

465
00:23:12.635 --> 00:23:15.549
He's never really used his back muscles
before.

466
00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:17.096
(Level 1 challenge)

467
00:23:18.258 --> 00:23:19.854
(Flexible)

468
00:23:24.872 --> 00:23:27.502
(Yeong-cheol clears Level 1 with ease)

469
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:31.581
Just finish it off in 3 tries.

470
00:23:31.628 --> 00:23:33.377
(Level 2 challenge)

471
00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:37.885
(Yeong-cheol also clears Level 2!)

472
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.627
(Sometimes we find hidden talents
with this guy)

473
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:41.987
That's amazing!

474
00:23:42.019 --> 00:23:43.542
Lowering it another 5 cm.

475
00:23:44.612 --> 00:23:47.338
- You're in your mid-40s.
- I should be good at this, at least.

476
00:23:47.401 --> 00:23:49.565
(Level 3 challenge)

477
00:23:50.456 --> 00:23:52.409
You got a very fresh back.

478
00:23:53.755 --> 00:23:55.690
Like a Hungarian gymnast, right?

479
00:23:55.706 --> 00:23:59.042
He actually tried gymnastics before,
but was rejected because of his face.

480
00:23:59.081 --> 00:24:01.018
(A gymnastic angel, Kim Yeong-cheol)

481
00:24:01.034 --> 00:24:02.768
I did want to get into gymnastics.

482
00:24:02.831 --> 00:24:04.502
I had no idea!

483
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.720
Good, good!

484
00:24:08.498 --> 00:24:09.667
This is hard.

485
00:24:10.263 --> 00:24:11.581
(Another success?)

486
00:24:13.007 --> 00:24:15.620
(He cheats by moving his head)

487
00:24:15.645 --> 00:24:18.362
- That's a fail.
- That's no good?

488
00:24:18.387 --> 00:24:20.815
(He fails despite his victory ceremony)

489
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:21.612
OK, next!

490
00:24:21.637 --> 00:24:23.643
It's not the right mentality
of an athlete.

491
00:24:25.308 --> 00:24:27.508
Kyung-hoon's good at this, right?

492
00:24:27.533 --> 00:24:29.081
(Kyung-hoon's Level 1 challenge)

493
00:24:30.244 --> 00:24:32.081
My back's been hurting lately.

494
00:24:33.147 --> 00:24:35.620
(He clears Level 1 with ease)

495
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.018
Everyone's so flexible?
Better than me, I think.

496
00:24:39.331 --> 00:24:41.682
(Now challenging Level 2)

497
00:24:43.856 --> 00:24:45.456
Everyone's so good!

498
00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:48.549
(Nervous)

499
00:24:52.844 --> 00:24:54.682
(He clears Level 2!)

500
00:24:54.745 --> 00:24:56.345
Go down another 5 cm.

501
00:24:56.544 --> 00:24:57.924
This can be dangerous.

502
00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.987
(Challenging Level 3!)

503
00:25:00.104 --> 00:25:01.792
This is where Yeong-cheol failed?

504
00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:03.221
Yes, at Level 3.

505
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:05.596
It's harder because of what's
in the middle.

506
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.588
You can't do that, I did it on the mat.

507
00:25:10.171 --> 00:25:11.448
It's up to me.

508
00:25:13.934 --> 00:25:15.362
That's fine, right?

509
00:25:20.066 --> 00:25:21.706
(He succeeds in clearing Level 3!)

510
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.135
He clears Level 3!

511
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.737
Wow, you're good!

512
00:25:25.386 --> 00:25:27.182
Let's try Level 4!

513
00:25:28.121 --> 00:25:29.799
This is no joke.

514
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:31.682
Here I go!

515
00:25:32.924 --> 00:25:34.729
Slowly, you can do it!

516
00:25:35.377 --> 00:25:37.315
(Almost...)

517
00:25:41.113 --> 00:25:42.980
(Kyung-hoon clears Level 4!)

518
00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.495
(Speechless)

519
00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:47.667
Fight on!

520
00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:49.940
Challenging Level 5!

521
00:25:51.956 --> 00:25:53.292
Slowly, yes!

522
00:25:53.308 --> 00:25:55.315
I might poop.

523
00:25:57.098 --> 00:25:59.088
(Will he poop?)

524
00:26:00.464 --> 00:26:02.064
(Or succeed?)

525
00:26:05.653 --> 00:26:08.026
(Kyung-hoon clears Level 5!)

526
00:26:08.051 --> 00:26:09.698
I can't believe it!

527
00:26:09.737 --> 00:26:10.924
No way!

528
00:26:10.956 --> 00:26:12.877
(Unbelievable!)

529
00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.018
He got it?

530
00:26:14.097 --> 00:26:16.838
(He's the star of the show again this week)

531
00:26:17.612 --> 00:26:18.979
Level 6!

532
00:26:19.003 --> 00:26:20.603
This is impossible!

533
00:26:22.034 --> 00:26:23.768
(Challenging Level 6!)

534
00:26:23.793 --> 00:26:25.182
This is really amazing.

535
00:26:27.663 --> 00:26:28.956
This is really low.

536
00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:30.909
I feel like my back hurts
from just watching.

537
00:26:32.248 --> 00:26:34.229
It's the last one to clear.

538
00:26:34.409 --> 00:26:36.190
You got it, you got it!

539
00:26:41.806 --> 00:26:43.495
(Kyung-hoon clears Level 6!)

540
00:26:43.558 --> 00:26:46.877
(God, is this really my own body?)

541
00:26:48.217 --> 00:26:50.042
(Shocked)

542
00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:52.284
(Can't think straight from the shock)

543
00:26:53.719 --> 00:26:56.893
(It's a sporting match, rather
than comedy)

544
00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:00.917
(Challenging Level 7!)

545
00:27:01.982 --> 00:27:04.635
Maybe I shouldn't be a singer
to make a living.

546
00:27:05.222 --> 00:27:07.752
I should look for a limbo competition.

547
00:27:08.775 --> 00:27:11.674
(The one who suggested the game
is already in shock)

548
00:27:13.637 --> 00:27:16.307
It's hard for me to just crawl
under it.

549
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:18.450
This is hard already.

550
00:27:21.097 --> 00:27:23.620
You're done already, just wait
in the waiting room.

551
00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:25.659
(Excuse me)

552
00:27:28.436 --> 00:27:29.745
Come on.

553
00:27:30.378 --> 00:27:31.978
This one!

554
00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.338
If you can clear this one, really...

555
00:27:34.448 --> 00:27:36.799
(Will he succeed in clearing Level 7?)

556
00:27:36.823 --> 00:27:40.229
I think he's already won the match
at Level 6.

557
00:27:40.283 --> 00:27:41.892
I think many people will criticize
this game.

558
00:27:41.917 --> 00:27:42.495
Why?

559
00:27:42.526 --> 00:27:44.604
I think this is Level 2 for me.

560
00:27:46.168 --> 00:27:48.252
All the short people will get mad.

561
00:27:48.277 --> 00:27:51.120
We should've played a game
for the short people.

562
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.425
(Unintentionally blamed)

563
00:27:53.628 --> 00:27:54.479
I'm gonna try.

564
00:27:54.503 --> 00:27:56.721
(Challenging Level 7!)

565
00:27:59.307 --> 00:28:00.862
This will be unprecedented!

566
00:28:01.105 --> 00:28:04.385
If you clear this, it's really incredible.

567
00:28:04.729 --> 00:28:07.464
(Slowly feeling the limitation
of what his body can handle)

568
00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:12.128
This was the only thing Yeong-cheol
could beat us in.

569
00:28:12.182 --> 00:28:15.815
- You haven't gone yet?
- Everyone forgot about me already.

570
00:28:18.342 --> 00:28:20.307
You got it, you got it!

571
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.854
I'm gonna try.

572
00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:26.073
You got it, you got it!

573
00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:33.581
(Kyung-hoon clears Level 7!)

574
00:28:34.885 --> 00:28:36.479
My legs are giving out now.

575
00:28:36.518 --> 00:28:38.432
(I'm so proud of you, my son!)

576
00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:41.221
(Challenging Level 8!)

577
00:28:42.335 --> 00:28:45.643
(Going for a new record, regardless
of winning)

578
00:28:45.753 --> 00:28:47.885
This will be the challenge of your life!

579
00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.420
He's the king of limbo!

580
00:28:50.456 --> 00:28:52.026
He should be called "Lim" Kyung-hoon.

581
00:28:52.066 --> 00:28:55.518
I am very responsible for things
that are given to me.

582
00:28:55.715 --> 00:28:59.714
But for Soo-geun to be at Level 8,
it'll be this low!

583
00:29:01.117 --> 00:29:02.268
People will blame you for this.

584
00:29:02.284 --> 00:29:04.229
It's down here for Soo-geun!

585
00:29:04.581 --> 00:29:06.604
(Feels bad for no reason)

586
00:29:06.629 --> 00:29:09.667
(Challenging the unprecedented Level 8!)

587
00:29:09.697 --> 00:29:12.364
You should dig the ground ahead of time.

588
00:29:12.605 --> 00:29:14.557
I might go even lower.

589
00:29:14.792 --> 00:29:16.926
- Level 8!
- Wow, let's see it!

590
00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:19.175
This might be hard.

591
00:29:19.728 --> 00:29:21.479
Hold on, whoa!

592
00:29:24.215 --> 00:29:25.339
(Please!)

593
00:29:27.558 --> 00:29:29.862
(Kyung-hoon fails at Level 8)

594
00:29:30.142 --> 00:29:32.690
(He failed, but put up a great fight!)

595
00:29:32.715 --> 00:29:35.316
That was an awesome failure.

596
00:29:35.378 --> 00:29:37.635
(Kyung-hoon is favored to win)

597
00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:40.604
(Soo-geun makes his challenge)

598
00:29:40.659 --> 00:29:42.128
I'll show you exactly where.

599
00:29:42.182 --> 00:29:43.698
(Peeking out)

600
00:29:43.731 --> 00:29:45.792
Your belly button is so cute!

601
00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.034
You're lifting up your belly button!

602
00:29:50.148 --> 00:29:52.010
(But it's still very low)

603
00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:55.284
Others' Level 5 is my Level 1.

604
00:29:55.745 --> 00:29:57.800
(Soo-geun's challenge in Level 1)

605
00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.495
The games are advancing more and more.

606
00:30:02.805 --> 00:30:03.995
(Soo-geun clears Level 1!)

607
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.956
He's got 2 kids!

608
00:30:06.425 --> 00:30:08.698
With great manners! I went
straight ahead.

609
00:30:08.761 --> 00:30:10.760
(Challenging Level 2!)

610
00:30:16.252 --> 00:30:17.964
I think he can totally do it.

611
00:30:21.578 --> 00:30:23.178
I stop here.

612
00:30:23.895 --> 00:30:26.479
(Soo-geun fails at Level 2!)

613
00:30:26.623 --> 00:30:28.643
I saw you tipping backwards.

614
00:30:28.668 --> 00:30:30.862
(Difficult even for Soo-geun,
our ace player)

615
00:30:30.887 --> 00:30:32.268
I felt like getting pulled.

616
00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:33.948
Lee Ha-nui, lastly!

617
00:30:33.972 --> 00:30:35.628
From where?

618
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.096
I'm right here.

619
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.182
Go higher.

620
00:30:38.214 --> 00:30:40.182
Her belly button's so high!

621
00:30:40.206 --> 00:30:41.893
She'll clear at least Level 3.

622
00:30:42.511 --> 00:30:45.510
Ha-nui, you can't come with
an extra belly button.

623
00:30:45.527 --> 00:30:47.127
(So ridiculous)

624
00:30:47.183 --> 00:30:49.612
You made another belly button
for this game!

625
00:30:49.699 --> 00:30:52.206
Your belly button's higher than mine?

626
00:30:52.445 --> 00:30:53.706
I'm right here1

627
00:30:53.738 --> 00:30:55.338
I'm here.

628
00:30:55.378 --> 00:30:58.409
(Skepticism over her belly button height)

629
00:30:58.503 --> 00:31:01.745
It's not so different than where
mine is.

630
00:31:01.784 --> 00:31:03.721
It's advantageous if you're tall
and flexible.

631
00:31:03.753 --> 00:31:06.206
Is that right? Should I try it?

632
00:31:07.722 --> 00:31:08.886
She suggested this game for a reason.

633
00:31:08.902 --> 00:31:12.190
- Have you done yoga?
- She probably cussed a lot [pun].

634
00:31:12.661 --> 00:31:13.862
(Challenging Level 1)

635
00:31:13.886 --> 00:31:15.604
She probably has in movies.

636
00:31:17.974 --> 00:31:19.574
She's struggling already.

637
00:31:20.222 --> 00:31:22.909
(Ha-nui barely clears Level 1!)

638
00:31:24.158 --> 00:31:26.948
I think Level 3, if miracle happens.

639
00:31:27.212 --> 00:31:29.128
(Unsure of herself)

640
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.526
How can a man be that good
in limbo?

641
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.651
(King of Limbo, "Lim" Kyung-hoon!)

642
00:31:33.722 --> 00:31:35.909
People don't play this game
that much anymore.

643
00:31:35.972 --> 00:31:38.136
Not since that old TV show.

644
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:39.456
Right?

645
00:31:41.656 --> 00:31:43.112
(Ha-nui clears Level 2!)

646
00:31:43.137 --> 00:31:44.846
Put it lower.

647
00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:47.089
(Challenging Level 3!)

648
00:31:48.128 --> 00:31:50.104
Kyung-hoon cleared Level 7!

649
00:31:50.129 --> 00:31:52.057
It'll be amazing if she did Level 9.

650
00:31:52.348 --> 00:31:53.800
How am I gonna do this?

651
00:31:53.831 --> 00:31:55.737
I feel my limit already.

652
00:32:00.358 --> 00:32:02.346
(Crack)

653
00:32:02.513 --> 00:32:04.925
(Stretching like a thug)

654
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:08.143
I can see what kind of stretching that is.

655
00:32:08.168 --> 00:32:10.792
(Everyone poses like a thug)

656
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.839
(Challenging Level 3!)

657
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.714
Cleared!

658
00:32:20.777 --> 00:32:23.573
(Ha-nui clears Level 3!)

659
00:32:23.644 --> 00:32:25.331
Women are more flexible.

660
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.807
I'm not that flexible considering.

661
00:32:27.839 --> 00:32:30.354
(Still leading by a lot)

662
00:32:31.018 --> 00:32:32.909
(Crack)

663
00:32:32.995 --> 00:32:35.628
She might clear Level 5.

664
00:32:35.925 --> 00:32:37.901
(Challenging Level 4!)

665
00:32:37.964 --> 00:32:41.745
How's Kyung-hoon so flexible
with his back?

666
00:32:43.613 --> 00:32:44.940
(Sighs)

667
00:32:45.782 --> 00:32:48.659
I suggested this game, Level 4
is not good enough.

668
00:32:52.827 --> 00:32:54.081
(Will she clear Level 4?)

669
00:32:54.106 --> 00:32:55.706
You got it, you got it!

670
00:32:57.935 --> 00:32:59.862
(Ha-nui fails at Level 4!)

671
00:33:00.251 --> 00:33:03.940
(Min Kyung-hoon wins the conditional
limbo match!)

672
00:33:04.034 --> 00:33:06.065
(He had no idea himself)

673
00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.745
(He's now got a nickname, "Lim Kyung-hoon")

674
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:11.221
I feel bad now.

675
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.870
We welcome her to our school!

676
00:33:13.894 --> 00:33:15.862
Congratulations, Ha-nui!

677
00:33:18.816 --> 00:33:20.815
It's time for her quiz.

678
00:33:20.988 --> 00:33:22.831
Leave your shoes behind when you go.

679
00:33:23.319 --> 00:33:25.003
(Oh, that's right!)

680
00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:27.596
Don't just leave after losing
the bet.

681
00:33:27.886 --> 00:33:29.901
Don't pretend like nothing happened.

682
00:33:30.376 --> 00:33:31.604
You "poop brother!"

683
00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.596
- You feel good that I'm here?
- Good!

684
00:33:33.628 --> 00:33:36.612
- How about you, the big brother?
- I feel good!

685
00:33:36.699 --> 00:33:38.714
Good, good! Me too.

686
00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:41.846
Did you have a drink during break time?

687
00:33:41.917 --> 00:33:44.432
This is how I am normally.

688
00:33:44.847 --> 00:33:46.378
Should I calm down a little?

689
00:33:46.402 --> 00:33:48.002
No, that's good!

690
00:33:48.745 --> 00:33:51.495
Let's start with the first question.

691
00:33:51.886 --> 00:33:55.026
I told you already that Jang-hoon
and I did a show together,

692
00:33:55.042 --> 00:33:56.925
"Four Sons and One Daughter."

693
00:33:56.949 --> 00:34:01.721
Something happened then when I felt
like Jang-hoon's such a great person.

694
00:34:01.745 --> 00:34:03.034
What do you think happened?

695
00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:04.214
I got it!

696
00:34:04.238 --> 00:34:05.854
I used to love that show.

697
00:34:05.879 --> 00:34:07.546
He said, "Just trust me."

698
00:34:07.589 --> 00:34:08.862
"Just trust me"? No.

699
00:34:08.893 --> 00:34:10.128
I got it!

700
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:14.393
When you saw Jang-hoon being so considerate
for all the staff members.

701
00:34:14.433 --> 00:34:17.761
When Ha-nui's manager didn't have
money for gas,

702
00:34:17.847 --> 00:34:21.651
Jang-hoon gave him 20,000 dollars
for gas money.

703
00:34:21.761 --> 00:34:23.284
That's not it.

704
00:34:23.308 --> 00:34:24.690
He was very nice to him though.

705
00:34:24.715 --> 00:34:26.589
Yeah, he knows how to treat
people well.

706
00:34:26.605 --> 00:34:27.534
I got it!

707
00:34:27.581 --> 00:34:31.628
He asked the elderly couple there
why they were still together.

708
00:34:31.675 --> 00:34:35.175
He asked them nicely, "Isn't it about
time you get sick of each other?"

709
00:34:35.252 --> 00:34:37.603
That I told them to break up?

710
00:34:38.017 --> 00:34:40.104
He suggested that they have
a new experience.

711
00:34:40.433 --> 00:34:45.557
No. It was the equivalent of my
asking him a favor, and he accepted.

712
00:34:45.635 --> 00:34:46.636
It was a hard one.

713
00:34:46.644 --> 00:34:48.244
I got it!

714
00:34:48.651 --> 00:34:50.182
A difficult favor...

715
00:34:50.206 --> 00:34:52.089
- You asked to borrow money from him.
- Money?

716
00:34:52.136 --> 00:34:55.336
Yeah, you asked to borrow like
100,000 dollars.

717
00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:56.440
A difficult favor, right?

718
00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:57.511
No, no.

719
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.089
It's got nothing to do with money.

720
00:34:59.144 --> 00:35:00.651
Honestly speaking...

721
00:35:00.682 --> 00:35:03.377
It's hard even for a real brother
to do this for me.

722
00:35:03.712 --> 00:35:05.604
(Jang-hoon himself isn't so sure either)

723
00:35:05.897 --> 00:35:10.854
He sucked out the spices of a piece of
kimchi because it was too spicy for you.

724
00:35:12.183 --> 00:35:13.901
(An amazing ability to imagine that)

725
00:35:15.622 --> 00:35:17.222
That can happen, right?

726
00:35:17.824 --> 00:35:19.886
Grandmas do that, right?

727
00:35:21.029 --> 00:35:22.831
Isn't that too disgusting?

728
00:35:22.933 --> 00:35:24.173
It's not about something dirty?

729
00:35:24.192 --> 00:35:26.823
Actually, it can feel that way depending
on what you make of it.

730
00:35:26.863 --> 00:35:31.073
He waited for you in front of the bathroom
because you were scared.

731
00:35:31.105 --> 00:35:33.628
And you fainted after at the sight of him.

732
00:35:34.226 --> 00:35:36.041
(That's possible!)

733
00:35:36.413 --> 00:35:38.706
(The giant can be scarier than the ghost)

734
00:35:38.753 --> 00:35:40.401
Bathroom?

735
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.167
Bathroom?

736
00:35:41.214 --> 00:35:44.440
I got it! Maybe there was no bathroom.

737
00:35:44.503 --> 00:35:45.386
Right.

738
00:35:45.411 --> 00:35:47.387
They don't have a lot of bathrooms
in the countryside.

739
00:35:47.417 --> 00:35:50.511
Maybe you had to go number 2 outdoors.

740
00:35:50.917 --> 00:35:53.823
You wanted to go, but you were embarrassed
over the noise you might make.

741
00:35:53.847 --> 00:35:57.612
So Jang-hoon beat-boxed to
the timing of your pooping.

742
00:36:01.988 --> 00:36:04.065
It's very close!

743
00:36:05.425 --> 00:36:07.292
I got it, I know the answer.

744
00:36:07.463 --> 00:36:12.471
There were a lot of people here,
but no one around on this side.

745
00:36:12.496 --> 00:36:14.136
So you can go easily there.

746
00:36:14.175 --> 00:36:17.800
You had to cross a stream, and he
became the bridge for you.

747
00:36:17.855 --> 00:36:18.971
So you stepped on him to go over.

748
00:36:19.011 --> 00:36:20.956
"Step on me to go over."

749
00:36:23.449 --> 00:36:26.167
Your real brother can't do that!

750
00:36:26.226 --> 00:36:28.643
Right? It's such a kind act.

751
00:36:28.699 --> 00:36:30.011
So creative!

752
00:36:30.764 --> 00:36:34.136
I think he could've, but refused because
he thought it's too dirty.

753
00:36:34.722 --> 00:36:37.284
Kyung-hoon's answer was very close.

754
00:36:37.331 --> 00:36:38.925
Almost there.

755
00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:41.159
I said he waited for her in front
of the bathroom.

756
00:36:41.292 --> 00:36:46.128
Jang-hoon kept talking so Ha-nui
won't get scared.

757
00:36:46.409 --> 00:36:49.495
(The giant's voice was soothing
for Ha-nui?)

758
00:36:51.448 --> 00:36:52.448
Where?

759
00:36:52.503 --> 00:36:53.581
Where?

760
00:36:53.635 --> 00:36:55.675
Sitting in front of you like this.

761
00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:01.440
- "Jang-hoon, what are you doing?"
- "Long time ago..."

762
00:37:01.542 --> 00:37:02.729
So you won't be scared.

763
00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:04.581
You're almost there!

764
00:37:04.613 --> 00:37:06.026
It wasn't at a bathroom.

765
00:37:06.042 --> 00:37:09.432
There probably weren't any street light
since it was at a countryside.

766
00:37:09.456 --> 00:37:11.331
It was completely dark.

767
00:37:11.385 --> 00:37:13.964
So you told him that you didn't
want to go outside alone,

768
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.526
and the bathroom was too far.

769
00:37:15.551 --> 00:37:17.484
You asked him to go with you.

770
00:37:17.527 --> 00:37:20.753
So while Ha-nui was taking care
of business...

771
00:37:20.778 --> 00:37:22.292
He stood by you to keep you
company.

772
00:37:22.331 --> 00:37:24.214
That's right! It's the correct answer.

773
00:37:24.253 --> 00:37:27.487
I had to go pee at night, in the mountains.

774
00:37:27.503 --> 00:37:28.925
He kept a look-out for me.

775
00:37:28.949 --> 00:37:30.862
(You're amazing, Jang-hoon!)

776
00:37:30.925 --> 00:37:32.768
I really had to go.

777
00:37:32.777 --> 00:37:36.057
There was a tub, but they left
cameras on.

778
00:37:36.191 --> 00:37:38.518
I couldn't use it, but I had to.

779
00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:40.940
There was a bathroom,
the squatting kind.

780
00:37:40.972 --> 00:37:45.753
It was far and there were many scary
dogs tied up on the way.

781
00:37:45.824 --> 00:37:48.987
I was so scared, whenever I got
near them,

782
00:37:49.012 --> 00:37:52.300
the dogs would go crazy at seeing
me since they weren't familiar.

783
00:37:52.347 --> 00:37:54.151
I just didn't have the courage
to go past them.

784
00:37:54.183 --> 00:37:56.331
I was also scared of snakes.

785
00:37:56.362 --> 00:37:58.612
And also scared that the dogs
might bite me.

786
00:37:58.675 --> 00:38:01.901
I thought of old ghost stories like
a ghost offering me different

787
00:38:01.925 --> 00:38:03.081
colors of toilet paper.

788
00:38:03.097 --> 00:38:05.143
All these thoughts were going through
my mind.

789
00:38:05.167 --> 00:38:07.815
I couldn't help it, so I woke Jang-hoon up.

790
00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:09.245
He was asleep?

791
00:38:09.284 --> 00:38:11.682
I asked him to walk me to the bathroom.

792
00:38:11.707 --> 00:38:14.050
He was taken aback at first.

793
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:15.096
He didn't know what to do.

794
00:38:15.121 --> 00:38:16.308
Of course he was.

795
00:38:16.347 --> 00:38:19.026
He probably thought she woke you up
for a different reason.

796
00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:20.681
(A different reason?)

797
00:38:20.706 --> 00:38:23.003
No, we weren't like that.

798
00:38:23.253 --> 00:38:26.315
That's when I first met her.

799
00:38:26.386 --> 00:38:28.104
It was our first house for the show.

800
00:38:28.129 --> 00:38:29.534
It was our first episode.

801
00:38:29.574 --> 00:38:31.956
It wasn't much of a bathroom.

802
00:38:32.026 --> 00:38:35.862
I actually slipped over frozen ground
and fell.

803
00:38:35.995 --> 00:38:41.315
I fell, then got up, and we were going
to the bathroom but she said she couldn't.

804
00:38:41.393 --> 00:38:45.167
Then I looked around and saw
a small hen house.

805
00:38:45.192 --> 00:38:51.245
And next to the hen house, there was
a place she could go just to pee.

806
00:38:51.316 --> 00:38:53.516
I asked the cameramen to go away.

807
00:38:53.644 --> 00:38:56.675
I told her she should go there and
kept a look-out for her where

808
00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.300
I couldn't see her.

809
00:38:58.386 --> 00:39:00.034
It was next to a hen house.

810
00:39:00.089 --> 00:39:03.800
She was about to go, and the chickens
started going crazy.

811
00:39:03.825 --> 00:39:05.643
I almost passed out, I was so scared.

812
00:39:05.659 --> 00:39:08.589
I already pulled down my pants
and I started to go.

813
00:39:08.613 --> 00:39:10.534
Then the chickens started going crazy.

814
00:39:10.573 --> 00:39:12.370
I screamed.

815
00:39:12.386 --> 00:39:13.932
But I still had to finish going.

816
00:39:13.995 --> 00:39:17.003
Jang-hoon must've thought you had to
let out a big one.

817
00:39:17.058 --> 00:39:20.065
"Where are you, Jang-hoon?"
"I'm right here."

818
00:39:20.097 --> 00:39:21.697
"Don't go anywhere!"

819
00:39:21.729 --> 00:39:25.956
But I didn't want him to hear me go,
"But don't come close!"

820
00:39:26.416 --> 00:39:28.956
"Don't go anywhere but don't come
close either."

821
00:39:29.103 --> 00:39:30.776
He had to stay there.

822
00:39:31.522 --> 00:39:34.112
He makes chicken noise really well.

823
00:39:34.274 --> 00:39:36.159
(He tricked Ha-nui)

824
00:39:36.183 --> 00:39:38.026
You thought they were chickens?

825
00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:39.440
(Was that the case?)

826
00:39:39.511 --> 00:39:41.276
He's an expert at making chicken noises.

827
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.487
(No one knew Jang-hoon had that talent)

828
00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:49.589
Ha-nui had a public image of being someone
so city-like and modern.

829
00:39:49.628 --> 00:39:52.534
But after seeing that episode...

830
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.784
People got to know how down-to-earth
she is from the show.

831
00:39:56.809 --> 00:39:58.714
You're making a lot of effort, Jang-hoon.

832
00:39:58.816 --> 00:40:03.042
But Gu-Ra was there, so were Min-jong
and Jae-won.

833
00:40:03.136 --> 00:40:04.768
Why'd you ask Jang-hoon?

834
00:40:05.378 --> 00:40:06.979
I just felt the most comfortable with him.

835
00:40:07.011 --> 00:40:08.611
With Jang-hoon?

836
00:40:08.824 --> 00:40:11.878
He felt like he was my real older
brother, I feel the same now.

837
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.909
What would you have said if she were
really your sister?

838
00:40:14.925 --> 00:40:17.104
And asked you to take her to
the bathroom?

839
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:18.526
One word, 100%.

840
00:40:18.671 --> 00:40:20.620
(I'm sleeping)

841
00:40:21.108 --> 00:40:22.518
(Right?)

842
00:40:22.581 --> 00:40:25.323
I'm sure I would've for my real sister.

843
00:40:25.378 --> 00:40:27.761
Jang-hoon that I know would've.

844
00:40:27.769 --> 00:40:30.143
That happens a lot in the countryside,
when you're little.

845
00:40:30.229 --> 00:40:32.666
Anything funny happened since he's so
down-to-earth?

846
00:40:32.699 --> 00:40:34.761
It was her who was so down-to-earth.

847
00:40:34.769 --> 00:40:36.003
Not really me.

848
00:40:36.057 --> 00:40:39.136
I didn't become this way, but I was always
like this since I was little.

849
00:40:39.183 --> 00:40:41.011
It's just her personality.

850
00:40:41.128 --> 00:40:45.159
I got in trouble a lot because of
this one habit that I had.

851
00:40:45.214 --> 00:40:46.651
What do you think it was?

852
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:48.307
You'd steal!

853
00:40:48.347 --> 00:40:49.839
Stealing out of people's wallets.

854
00:40:49.886 --> 00:40:53.659
No, I didn't do anything
criminal like that.

855
00:40:53.722 --> 00:40:55.989
- How old?
- Maybe around 4 or 5.

856
00:40:56.042 --> 00:40:58.417
A habit of yours when you were little?

857
00:40:59.802 --> 00:41:01.401
Did you wet your bed?

858
00:41:01.503 --> 00:41:03.103
Similar.

859
00:41:03.478 --> 00:41:04.807
You pooped in your bed?

860
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:10.440
You left the door open when you
went to the bathroom.

861
00:41:10.605 --> 00:41:12.205
No, not that.

862
00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:14.682
(That was funny, Yeong-cheol)

863
00:41:14.722 --> 00:41:16.721
That's true, what's similar to pee
is poop.

864
00:41:16.738 --> 00:41:18.979
You said it was similar!

865
00:41:19.425 --> 00:41:21.025
You'd pee standing up?

866
00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:23.018
(Close!)

867
00:41:23.043 --> 00:41:24.043
Pee...

868
00:41:24.058 --> 00:41:25.870
You'd pee while standing upside down!

869
00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:26.776
No.

870
00:41:26.801 --> 00:41:29.370
I got it, you'd pee on your dad's face!

871
00:41:30.517 --> 00:41:32.315
You just need to get the place right.

872
00:41:32.347 --> 00:41:36.557
Oh, you'd pee somewhere in your room,
like in your closet!

873
00:41:36.628 --> 00:41:38.081
- Not a closet
- Fridge?

874
00:41:38.097 --> 00:41:38.932
No, not a fridge.

875
00:41:38.964 --> 00:41:42.034
I got it! Because you were little...

876
00:41:42.113 --> 00:41:47.393
You'd pee on the mat where dogs
go pee on.

877
00:41:47.447 --> 00:41:47.924
No, not it.

878
00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:49.151
On your room floor?

879
00:41:49.167 --> 00:41:50.167
No.

880
00:41:50.386 --> 00:41:52.893
Some people might have this in your house
or not.

881
00:41:52.902 --> 00:41:54.815
Everyone's got washer and dryer,
or a fridge.

882
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:57.440
You'd pee in the flower pots to water them!

883
00:41:57.534 --> 00:41:58.182
No.

884
00:41:58.237 --> 00:41:59.800
Some might have it or not?

885
00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.995
Yes, like flower pots, some have them
but some don't.

886
00:42:03.019 --> 00:42:04.495
In the fish tank!

887
00:42:04.519 --> 00:42:06.221
That's right!

888
00:42:06.809 --> 00:42:09.206
(She'd pee in the fish tank?)

889
00:42:09.355 --> 00:42:10.581
How can you do that?

890
00:42:10.606 --> 00:42:13.964
I'd climb up to the fish tank
and go there.

891
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:16.604
Mine looked like a toilet bowl.

892
00:42:16.683 --> 00:42:18.416
For the turtles, actually.

893
00:42:18.488 --> 00:42:21.292
I'd climb up and get in position,
it felt like it was made

894
00:42:21.317 --> 00:42:24.096
for me to go there.

895
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.096
(It can happen if you're a kid)

896
00:42:27.167 --> 00:42:30.636
Did you have any habits that you
couldn't easily fix?

897
00:42:30.644 --> 00:42:32.448
I wet my bed until I was in middle school.

898
00:42:32.472 --> 00:42:33.472
- Really?
- Yeah.

899
00:42:33.481 --> 00:42:34.370
Me too, actually.

900
00:42:34.394 --> 00:42:37.331
- While you were asleep?
- Yeah, found out in the morning.

901
00:42:37.355 --> 00:42:39.362
It wasn't a wet dream?

902
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.893
Never mind.

903
00:42:40.951 --> 00:42:42.714
(Did we hear it wrong?)

904
00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:44.776
(So bright)

905
00:42:44.824 --> 00:42:46.495
She's like that!

906
00:42:46.665 --> 00:42:48.206
It's not weird to have a wet dream.

907
00:42:48.245 --> 00:42:51.487
I'd wet my bed until I was
in middle school.

908
00:42:51.512 --> 00:42:53.612
I had low blood pressure too, had anemia.

909
00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:54.862
(I see)

910
00:42:54.878 --> 00:42:57.682
I'd wet my bed until I was in the 5th
or 6th grade too.

911
00:42:58.429 --> 00:42:59.815
5th or 6th grade?

912
00:42:59.866 --> 00:43:02.721
There were many kids in the countryside
who'd wet their beds.

913
00:43:02.776 --> 00:43:04.995
I used to suck on my thumb for a long
time, too.

914
00:43:05.027 --> 00:43:07.227
Did you guys eat your booger too?

915
00:43:07.253 --> 00:43:09.807
- Yeah, I did.
- I didn't.

916
00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.081
A lot of kids would hide and eat it,
so they won't get in trouble.

917
00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:13.784
It's seasoned well.

918
00:43:14.128 --> 00:43:16.378
(Great with rice!)

919
00:43:16.534 --> 00:43:18.448
(That's what Soo-geun did?)

920
00:43:18.628 --> 00:43:19.862
Moving on to the third question.

921
00:43:19.886 --> 00:43:21.690
Finishing at my story?

922
00:43:21.794 --> 00:43:23.448
What is this?

923
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:25.729
It ends with your experience of
eating your booger!

924
00:43:25.754 --> 00:43:29.331
I'm sure we all did, whether or not
we remember it.

925
00:43:29.355 --> 00:43:31.557
(Sure, to make Soo-geun feel better)

926
00:43:31.597 --> 00:43:33.589
I'd drink from my runny nose!

927
00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:36.112
We do that still.

928
00:43:36.159 --> 00:43:37.800
It just happens.

929
00:43:38.742 --> 00:43:41.636
Besides that, did you do anything bad
while growing up?

930
00:43:41.667 --> 00:43:43.737
What was the worst thing you did?

931
00:43:43.761 --> 00:43:45.494
I ran away from home once.

932
00:43:45.527 --> 00:43:46.823
For how long?

933
00:43:46.848 --> 00:43:48.806
A few days. Not that long.

934
00:43:48.831 --> 00:43:50.073
How old were you?

935
00:43:50.159 --> 00:43:51.987
I did that often.

936
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.151
Even when I was little.

937
00:43:54.276 --> 00:43:58.917
My parents thought I was kidnapped,
and they put a prize to look for me.

938
00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:01.214
- Because you were mad at them?
- I just left.

939
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.581
When I was little, I'd just
leave the house.

940
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.300
And didn't come home for a few days?

941
00:44:05.354 --> 00:44:07.424
- Not like you ran away then.
- No, not then.

942
00:44:07.605 --> 00:44:09.651
You wanted to be a Gypsy even
when you were little!

943
00:44:09.659 --> 00:44:11.018
I think so, a little.

944
00:44:11.058 --> 00:44:13.643
Why'd you leave your home later on?

945
00:44:13.847 --> 00:44:15.761
Because I felt so frustrated.

946
00:44:16.747 --> 00:44:21.128
I felt really lost when I was in
middle school and high school.

947
00:44:21.214 --> 00:44:25.440
I felt very pressured from what I was
supposed to achieve.

948
00:44:25.519 --> 00:44:26.956
I know what you mean.

949
00:44:26.995 --> 00:44:31.307
How about you, Jang-hoon? I'm sure
it was hard training all the time.

950
00:44:31.363 --> 00:44:37.315
You'd come home after a hard day of
training, and your parents nag you more?

951
00:44:37.401 --> 00:44:39.886
It'll make you want to rebel, right?

952
00:44:39.964 --> 00:44:42.823
I ran away from home because of that.
But I had nowhere to go.

953
00:44:42.878 --> 00:44:45.268
It was a cold winter night.

954
00:44:45.355 --> 00:44:47.088
And I slept on the street.

955
00:44:47.113 --> 00:44:49.042
You left home and slept out
on the street?

956
00:44:49.066 --> 00:44:50.721
I had nowhere to go, it was very cold.

957
00:44:50.769 --> 00:44:53.120
I thought he was asking me a question.

958
00:44:53.159 --> 00:44:54.959
(But he told his own story)

959
00:44:57.295 --> 00:44:58.909
Why'd you ask me then?

960
00:44:58.941 --> 00:45:01.393
I'm saying that's what happened to me.

961
00:45:01.409 --> 00:45:03.042
I did that before, is what I'm saying.

962
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.206
I was a sensitive kid back then.

963
00:45:06.347 --> 00:45:10.378
I ran away from home for 5 days before,
and slept over at my friend's house.

964
00:45:10.433 --> 00:45:14.542
My dad raised me, and he actually told
me to just go to my friends' places.

965
00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:16.776
(The missing 5 days of Soo-geun's life)

966
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:19.019
He had no interest in my life.

967
00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.292
He didn't even know.

968
00:45:21.331 --> 00:45:23.011
He didn't even tell me to eat.

969
00:45:24.487 --> 00:45:28.057
I never ran away from home in middle
or high school.

970
00:45:28.081 --> 00:45:29.550
I was busy from training.

971
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:33.229
But in college, after getting into
Yonsei University...

972
00:45:33.277 --> 00:45:35.339
I was already pretty famous by then.

973
00:45:35.363 --> 00:45:39.565
I told my school that I was gonna quit
playing basketball, and left the school.

974
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:40.628
From the dorm?

975
00:45:40.667 --> 00:45:44.542
Yeah, and I spent a week at my friend's
house instead of going home.

976
00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:46.550
Why'd you want to quit?

977
00:45:46.683 --> 00:45:49.471
Let me just say that I got yelled
at a lot.

978
00:45:49.488 --> 00:45:51.534
I got yelled at a lot.

979
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:55.237
I was already known as a famous
basketball player,

980
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:58.925
but I got yelled at so much that I
wanted to quit playing basketball.

981
00:45:58.941 --> 00:46:01.159
I'm sure that's why you became
such a great player.

982
00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:03.596
Yes, that's true, I love my coach.

983
00:46:03.706 --> 00:46:06.581
But back then, I was younger.
I got yelled at a lot!

984
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.887
My coach gave me such a hard time.

985
00:46:09.613 --> 00:46:13.870
It was to the point that I didn't care
about basketball or winning championship.

986
00:46:13.902 --> 00:46:16.214
I stormed out and said I was quitting.

987
00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:17.996
It happened about 3 times.

988
00:46:18.011 --> 00:46:21.870
He looks very gentle, he doesn't look
like he'd do that.

989
00:46:21.894 --> 00:46:22.940
But he's really scary.

990
00:46:22.964 --> 00:46:24.823
I almost died a few times.

991
00:46:25.542 --> 00:46:27.534
Sorry, Coach.

992
00:46:30.458 --> 00:46:32.167
Here's my third question.

993
00:46:32.237 --> 00:46:34.511
When I was shooting the movie, "Tazza,"

994
00:46:34.573 --> 00:46:37.776
I laughed out hysterically because
of my manager once.

995
00:46:37.831 --> 00:46:39.190
What do you think happened?

996
00:46:39.214 --> 00:46:41.034
"Tazza" is about gambling, right?

997
00:46:41.059 --> 00:46:43.926
You asked the manager to shuffle the cards.

998
00:46:43.949 --> 00:46:47.415
And your manager slipped in
an extra card to cheat.

999
00:46:47.448 --> 00:46:51.495
And you made a lot of money
because of it.

1000
00:46:52.002 --> 00:46:52.791
No.

1001
00:46:52.831 --> 00:46:55.003
Your manager came on the movie!

1002
00:46:55.683 --> 00:46:56.683
No.

1003
00:46:56.706 --> 00:47:01.721
It's a mistake he made because
he didn't really know.

1004
00:47:01.815 --> 00:47:05.253
You said a line while shooting,
"What do you think you're doing?"

1005
00:47:05.269 --> 00:47:08.159
Then he answered you, "I'm sorry
Ha-nui!"

1006
00:47:08.214 --> 00:47:09.721
"I apologize!"

1007
00:47:09.753 --> 00:47:11.776
He got so used to getting beat up
by you.

1008
00:47:11.801 --> 00:47:14.636
So he said that out of habit, out loud.

1009
00:47:15.456 --> 00:47:17.542
While she was in the shoot already!

1010
00:47:17.567 --> 00:47:19.159
The manager replied to your line.

1011
00:47:19.184 --> 00:47:20.331
To give you a hint,

1012
00:47:20.363 --> 00:47:23.221
it was something that happened
over vitamins.

1013
00:47:23.246 --> 00:47:24.846
Oh, I got it!

1014
00:47:24.878 --> 00:47:29.995
You asked for vitamins because
you were tired.

1015
00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:32.050
But he got you laxatives instead.

1016
00:47:32.097 --> 00:47:33.511
No, not it.

1017
00:47:33.574 --> 00:47:37.714
They don't even sound similar!
How can he confuse them?

1018
00:47:38.214 --> 00:47:40.839
They do sound similar.

1019
00:47:42.065 --> 00:47:43.854
(Do they?)

1020
00:47:46.101 --> 00:47:50.589
I'm sure if someone else said it,
we'd get mad because it's not funny.

1021
00:47:50.636 --> 00:47:52.386
It's OK if Kyung-hoon says it.

1022
00:47:52.418 --> 00:47:57.596
You asked for vitamins but he brought
cold medicine out of nowhere.

1023
00:47:57.659 --> 00:48:00.151
That's very close, very similar.

1024
00:48:00.488 --> 00:48:04.823
You know the type that you mix in water
and it bubbles up?

1025
00:48:04.894 --> 00:48:06.737
I didn't' know about it.

1026
00:48:07.774 --> 00:48:09.690
But I just put it straight
into my mouth.

1027
00:48:09.752 --> 00:48:11.245
I wanted some vitamins.

1028
00:48:11.253 --> 00:48:13.886
But they didn't really work for me, and
made my face twice as big.

1029
00:48:13.917 --> 00:48:15.851
Twice as big, from that size?

1030
00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.581
You must've ballooned up,
floating in the air!

1031
00:48:18.597 --> 00:48:21.839
I guess some vitamins can have
side effects.

1032
00:48:22.049 --> 00:48:23.729
I was so shocked.

1033
00:48:23.792 --> 00:48:25.870
I think you said the answer.

1034
00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:28.753
The vitamin you're supposed to
put in water...

1035
00:48:28.769 --> 00:48:29.878
He just ate it.

1036
00:48:29.917 --> 00:48:34.190
He drank water after, then started
to bubble up in his mouth.

1037
00:48:34.448 --> 00:48:35.776
That's right!

1038
00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:39.307
(Stares at him)

1039
00:48:39.922 --> 00:48:42.432
I caught on from what you were saying.

1040
00:48:42.464 --> 00:48:45.354
I asked for vitamins,
the bubbling type.

1041
00:48:45.379 --> 00:48:48.386
But that manager never saw it before.

1042
00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:50.440
He was amazed at how it worked.

1043
00:48:50.464 --> 00:48:53.987
He was looking at it for a long time
in the car.

1044
00:48:54.066 --> 00:48:57.034
I was wondering why he kept
looking at it.

1045
00:48:57.058 --> 00:48:59.042
So I was watching him.

1046
00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:00.511
He's supposed to put it in water.

1047
00:49:00.536 --> 00:49:02.136
But he went...

1048
00:49:04.581 --> 00:49:06.181
That's what happened!

1049
00:49:06.446 --> 00:49:08.659
(Vitamin explosion in his mouth)

1050
00:49:09.216 --> 00:49:11.206
It was a huge fiasco.

1051
00:49:11.231 --> 00:49:13.167
I'm sure it gets worse when you
pour water into your mouth!

1052
00:49:13.191 --> 00:49:15.784
He was a big guy, as big as Ho-dong.

1053
00:49:15.917 --> 00:49:17.932
He was so pure-hearted.

1054
00:49:18.128 --> 00:49:21.011
He made a huge scene, he thought
he was gonna die.

1055
00:49:21.036 --> 00:49:22.550
That's what happened.

1056
00:49:22.605 --> 00:49:24.378
- That's cute.
- Yeah, he was.

1057
00:49:24.409 --> 00:49:27.018
It's hard to spit stuff out when you're
in shock.

1058
00:49:27.043 --> 00:49:29.104
If your glove catches on fire, you should
just take off the glove.

1059
00:49:29.113 --> 00:49:30.581
But people try to put it out.

1060
00:49:30.606 --> 00:49:33.550
He could've just spat it out, but he
was in shock that he couldn't.

1061
00:49:33.574 --> 00:49:35.753
That's true, out of shock.

1062
00:49:35.777 --> 00:49:37.034
Soo-geun, too!

1063
00:49:37.066 --> 00:49:39.573
He can just run away from Ho-dong if
Ho-dong beats him up,

1064
00:49:39.612 --> 00:49:41.839
but he just gets shocked and gets
beat up.

1065
00:49:42.696 --> 00:49:45.206
No, he beats me up in the waiting room
these days.

1066
00:49:46.972 --> 00:49:48.714
Yeah, I beat him up now.

1067
00:49:50.432 --> 00:49:51.792
Don't do it!

1068
00:49:52.384 --> 00:49:53.464
(Gets scared)

1069
00:49:53.495 --> 00:49:55.643
Any episode from taking the wrong medicine?

1070
00:49:56.102 --> 00:49:58.190
You should only take medicine after
talking to a pharmacist.

1071
00:49:58.245 --> 00:50:01.104
Everyone's careful about it?
Even before?

1072
00:50:01.324 --> 00:50:04.292
When I catch a cold, I'm fighting
a big one right now,

1073
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:09.089
I don't want the virus to think
less of me by taking medicine.

1074
00:50:09.128 --> 00:50:10.932
So I never take any cold medicine,
and never have.

1075
00:50:10.972 --> 00:50:12.479
- To strengthen your immune system?
- Yes.

1076
00:50:12.511 --> 00:50:14.854
There's this medicine you take,
made out of bee venom.

1077
00:50:14.933 --> 00:50:19.175
They inject you with it, given by
an acupuncturist.

1078
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:24.503
My back was hurting really bad once,
and that's what I got.

1079
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:28.620
He suggested that I get a lot of those
shots since I'm big.

1080
00:50:28.711 --> 00:50:32.023
- My back was no longer the problem.
- You get the chills.

1081
00:50:32.867 --> 00:50:37.523
- I was shivering like Yoo
Oh-seong on "Friend". - Friend!

1082
00:50:37.664 --> 00:50:41.202
I spent the next two days shivering.
I was like this.

1083
00:50:41.468 --> 00:50:45.046
- Really? - Two days later, my back
was better and so was my back.

1084
00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:49.467
It's because I was shivering so much I
forgot about how much my back hurt.

1085
00:50:49.492 --> 00:50:50.990
That's how my back got better.

1086
00:50:51.015 --> 00:50:55.263
I sprained my ankle playing soccer
since I loved playing soccer so much.

1087
00:50:55.289 --> 00:50:57.746
I couldn't put any weight on it.
I knew it was bad.

1088
00:50:57.992 --> 00:51:01.937
I was about to get bee acupuncture
and I shouldn't have said anything...

1089
00:51:02.148 --> 00:51:04.248
but I told him our family
owned a bee pollen farm.

1090
00:51:04.273 --> 00:51:06.913
I confidently told them
I had no fear of bees.

1091
00:51:07.218 --> 00:51:10.984
I was stung a lot before. I laid in
bed for two days after my treatment.

1092
00:51:11.633 --> 00:51:13.210
Your ankle was better, wasn't it?

1093
00:51:13.234 --> 00:51:16.975
Two days later, my shivers were
gone and I was so happy I...

1094
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.647
wasn't shivering that I got up
and got myself a drink of water.

1095
00:51:19.672 --> 00:51:20.812
I was so surprised.

1096
00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:24.093
You get the shivers so badly that
you forget how much pain you're in.

1097
00:51:24.328 --> 00:51:26.202
The shivering is worse than the pain.

1098
00:51:26.289 --> 00:51:27.991
You forget about the pain.

1099
00:51:28.289 --> 00:51:31.820
We might set a trend with bee
sting treatment after this show.

1100
00:51:32.187 --> 00:51:33.412
You can't over do-it.

1101
00:51:33.437 --> 00:51:37.546
They used excess on me because of my size.

1102
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.140
Him because of size, me
because of no fear of bees.

1103
00:51:40.312 --> 00:51:43.046
It's good if you get an exact amount.

1104
00:51:43.343 --> 00:51:44.475
That's so fascinating.

1105
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.668
Korean wrestlers hold onto bands.

1106
00:51:46.742 --> 00:51:49.445
They hold onto the waistbands like this.

1107
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:52.584
All our fingers are contorted
this way after the match.

1108
00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:54.621
These fingers are turned the other way

1109
00:51:54.758 --> 00:51:56.543
What about when you play the gayageum?

1110
00:51:56.568 --> 00:52:00.616
Not only do my fingers hurt
but my shoulders as well.

1111
00:52:00.695 --> 00:52:03.933
I feel like I'll keep living with
pain all my life. I'm used to it.

1112
00:52:04.093 --> 00:52:08.832
I'm not sure why it happens. My teacher
couldn't raise her arms before she died.

1113
00:52:09.312 --> 00:52:11.562
There was no physical therapy back then.

1114
00:52:11.687 --> 00:52:16.015
We always have to sit sideways. Hee-chul
felt how strong the strings are.

1115
00:52:16.265 --> 00:52:19.671
You have to keep picking at the
strings while keeping them down.

1116
00:52:19.945 --> 00:52:22.390
It's the worst posture since
one hand is holding it...

1117
00:52:22.415 --> 00:52:24.835
down, the other is playing
and your back is twisted.

1118
00:52:24.859 --> 00:52:26.820
It's not easy making beautiful music.

1119
00:52:26.843 --> 00:52:30.717
- All my friends, who play an instrument
go through pain. - That's true.

1120
00:52:30.742 --> 00:52:33.687
- My wrist hurts too. - Why?
- Because you hold your mic this way?

1121
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:37.163
No, because of my mouse and keyboard.
I have callus here as well.

1122
00:52:37.437 --> 00:52:40.296
Kyung-hoon and I have the same callus.
You see?

1123
00:52:40.492 --> 00:52:42.562
- You got callus from holding the mouse?
- Yeah.

1124
00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.851
- Really?
- Yes, show the camera.

1125
00:52:44.968 --> 00:52:46.199
My goodness.

1126
00:52:46.718 --> 00:52:50.013
- That's pretty serious.
- You can see the color difference here.

1127
00:52:50.039 --> 00:52:53.429
- Stop, it's not good for young viewers.
- You guys are too much.

1128
00:52:53.781 --> 00:52:55.661
- Should we move onto the next question?
- Yeah.

1129
00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:58.374
- Stop asking him questions.
- This humming conversation is fun.

1130
00:52:58.562 --> 00:53:00.078
Humming conversation.

1131
00:53:00.211 --> 00:53:01.843
- I'll ask the next question.
- Okay.

1132
00:53:02.039 --> 00:53:05.452
I love playing the gayageum,
but when I was in school...

1133
00:53:05.547 --> 00:53:09.359
I used to try to get out of
practice by being sneaky.

1134
00:53:09.843 --> 00:53:12.999
How did I act sneaky in high school
when I didn't want to practice?

1135
00:53:13.054 --> 00:53:16.342
Isn't it obvious? You said you had on
a lot of casts when you were young.

1136
00:53:16.367 --> 00:53:19.445
You weren't hurt but you
wore fake casts on purpose.

1137
00:53:19.843 --> 00:53:21.499
I did, but it wasn't that.

1138
00:53:21.562 --> 00:53:23.343
I usually did this during ensemble classes.

1139
00:53:23.508 --> 00:53:27.070
I purposely didn't go to
class, but how did I not go?

1140
00:53:27.875 --> 00:53:30.925
- You cut one of your gayageum strings.
- No.

1141
00:53:31.035 --> 00:53:32.769
Did you do it on purpose?

1142
00:53:33.015 --> 00:53:35.648
I depended on it. It was
an automatic reaction.

1143
00:53:36.281 --> 00:53:38.725
It's something I did when I
didn't want to go to class.

1144
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:40.195
I became the gayageum.

1145
00:53:40.398 --> 00:53:41.730
I became the gayageum.

1146
00:53:41.843 --> 00:53:45.058
You wanted to skip class and since
the gayageum case was so big...

1147
00:53:45.148 --> 00:53:47.730
you decided to hide
inside the gayageum case.

1148
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:49.905
That's the answer, isn't it? I'm right!

1149
00:53:50.039 --> 00:53:51.605
(Hee-chul gets it right)

1150
00:53:51.781 --> 00:53:52.781
He got it right?

1151
00:53:53.453 --> 00:53:54.453
She hid inside the case.

1152
00:53:54.531 --> 00:53:58.085
Honestly, I would take a nap
inside the gayageum case.

1153
00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:02.109
I used it like a sleeping bag
inside the instrument storage room.

1154
00:54:02.148 --> 00:54:05.655
No one could find me if I hid inside
the case like a sleeping bag.

1155
00:54:05.836 --> 00:54:07.546
- You can fit in there?
- Yeah, I can.

1156
00:54:07.648 --> 00:54:09.530
- Can we get a case?
- Do we have one?

1157
00:54:09.609 --> 00:54:11.202
That's really big.

1158
00:54:11.351 --> 00:54:13.109
- That's...
- It's as big as a sleeping bag.

1159
00:54:13.258 --> 00:54:16.382
You could use that outside in the winter.

1160
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.921
You can see how thick this is.

1161
00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:21.547
I think Jang-hoon could even fit in there.

1162
00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.552
It's been a long time
since I've laid in here.

1163
00:54:23.577 --> 00:54:27.008
This is what you used to do
in junior and high school.

1164
00:54:27.546 --> 00:54:29.124
I would lay here and zip it up.

1165
00:54:29.718 --> 00:54:32.168
- You want me to zip it up?
- Yeah.

1166
00:54:32.437 --> 00:54:33.897
I would sleep like this.

1167
00:54:33.922 --> 00:54:35.308
Watch your hands.

1168
00:54:36.125 --> 00:54:37.125
You slept like that?

1169
00:54:37.429 --> 00:54:38.990
Where's Ha-nui? Ha-nui!

1170
00:54:39.015 --> 00:54:41.332
- Where's Lee Ha-nui?
- Ha-nui isn't here.

1171
00:54:41.492 --> 00:54:42.832
(Rolling away)

1172
00:54:43.273 --> 00:54:45.655
Let's move onto the next corner!

1173
00:54:45.773 --> 00:54:48.811
- That's how she would avoid people?
- Can we lift you like this?

1174
00:54:48.836 --> 00:54:50.881
- That's fascinating.
- The handle might rip.

1175
00:54:50.906 --> 00:54:54.171
It's not so bad since it's
warm during the winter.

1176
00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.545
- You fit perfectly in there.
- She does.

1177
00:54:56.570 --> 00:55:00.445
- How does she fit in there? - Korean
wrestlers do the same thing during summer.

1178
00:55:00.476 --> 00:55:05.952
There are a lot of trees around the arena
and we'll lay our bands down on the grass.

1179
00:55:06.976 --> 00:55:08.607
We sleep on our bands.

1180
00:55:08.633 --> 00:55:10.004
Even on the streets.

1181
00:55:10.218 --> 00:55:12.632
No, not only can you sleep in there...

1182
00:55:13.117 --> 00:55:15.874
but you can play with it as well.

1183
00:55:16.648 --> 00:55:18.905
- Is it something you did?
- Yes, I did.

1184
00:55:19.414 --> 00:55:20.734
It's really hard to do.

1185
00:55:20.875 --> 00:55:23.390
What? Do you try to escape on your own?

1186
00:55:23.703 --> 00:55:25.710
- Escaping by yourself?
- Do you want to try?

1187
00:55:25.765 --> 00:55:27.976
No, no. I don't want to.

1188
00:55:28.281 --> 00:55:31.593
- Try it. Let's try it. Show us.
- Should we try it?

1189
00:55:32.718 --> 00:55:35.740
- You're being so enthusiastic today.
- You should go help her.

1190
00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:36.765
You're too much.

1191
00:55:37.265 --> 00:55:40.390
- You can show us with her.
- You can't help your enthusiasm, can you?

1192
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:43.757
I bet Jang Yun-jeong is crying
tears of blood right now.

1193
00:55:43.929 --> 00:55:46.413
I wasn't mean to Jang Yun-jeong!

1194
00:55:46.781 --> 00:55:49.257
Yun-jeong was afraid to come on the show.

1195
00:55:49.586 --> 00:55:52.530
This game is called hopping gayageum.

1196
00:55:52.734 --> 00:55:54.062
Hopping gayageum.

1197
00:55:55.570 --> 00:56:00.030
Do you guys remember
hopping in potato sacks?

1198
00:56:00.062 --> 00:56:03.718
It's a simple racing game
of going and coming back.

1199
00:56:03.765 --> 00:56:05.433
I bet this will be so fun.

1200
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:10.046
- Did gayageum students
actually play this game? - Yes.

1201
00:56:10.929 --> 00:56:14.324
- You have to be the fastest.
- I can't wait to play. Come on guys.

1202
00:56:14.461 --> 00:56:17.968
- He's so enthusiastic.
- His name is Seo Enthusiastic.

1203
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:22.332
- Jang-hoon is so supportive. - It looks
like a guitar case when you carry it.

1204
00:56:22.836 --> 00:56:26.187
- It looks like your underwear.
- That's a smaller case.

1205
00:56:26.476 --> 00:56:28.179
You can make the teams, Ha-nui.

1206
00:56:28.375 --> 00:56:30.132
Let's go three against three.

1207
00:56:30.211 --> 00:56:31.928
- Three against three.
- Two need to sit out.

1208
00:56:31.953 --> 00:56:34.421
- Like a relay?
- Hee-chul can't play this.

1209
00:56:34.515 --> 00:56:37.523
I think this will be alright for me.

1210
00:56:37.812 --> 00:56:40.873
- You can choose first, Ha-nui.
- Loser buys jajangmyeon?

1211
00:56:40.898 --> 00:56:41.898
- Okay.
- Okay.

1212
00:56:42.289 --> 00:56:44.952
- How about naengmyeon? - The losing
team leader has to buy for everyone.

1213
00:56:44.976 --> 00:56:47.765
- Okay.
- Can you order jajangmyeon, please?

1214
00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.957
(Team Ha-nui versus Team Jang-hoon)

1215
00:56:51.312 --> 00:56:53.523
- Ho-dong!
- You can't jump without your shoes on?

1216
00:56:53.625 --> 00:56:55.758
Look at him. My goodness.

1217
00:56:56.156 --> 00:56:59.062
- Are you ready? - Don't zip it up too far.

1218
00:56:59.218 --> 00:57:01.644
My goodness. Why is everyone so good?

1219
00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:04.490
Yeong-cheol and Kyung-hoon
aren't joking around.

1220
00:57:04.515 --> 00:57:05.515
We're not joking either.

1221
00:57:05.562 --> 00:57:08.218
- Let's try hard.
- You can jump any which way you like.

1222
00:57:08.343 --> 00:57:09.882
You can roll if you want to.

1223
00:57:10.117 --> 00:57:11.757
- Okay.
- Let's go, let's go.

1224
00:57:11.843 --> 00:57:14.241
- Get ready!
- Is everyone ready?

1225
00:57:14.383 --> 00:57:15.506
- Get ready.
- Let's not cheat.

1226
00:57:15.531 --> 00:57:17.764
- They ordered jajangmyeon for us.
- No pushing.

1227
00:57:23.609 --> 00:57:25.175
Ho-dong is cheating.

1228
00:57:25.398 --> 00:57:27.242
Geez, Ho-dong!

1229
00:57:27.961 --> 00:57:30.129
- Push him. Push him.
- You got this.

1230
00:57:30.468 --> 00:57:33.019
(They neck-and-neck through the midpoint)

1231
00:57:33.272 --> 00:57:35.668
(Ho-dong comes in a bit
faster and relays the baton)

1232
00:57:35.734 --> 00:57:37.874
- Take it off! Hurry.
- Take it off. You're good.

1233
00:57:38.062 --> 00:57:39.593
Hurry and put it on.

1234
00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.921
- You're good.
- Go, go, go.

1235
00:57:42.265 --> 00:57:44.133
We're supposed to be zipped up.

1236
00:57:44.226 --> 00:57:46.139
- Zip it up!
- You forgot to zip it.

1237
00:57:46.164 --> 00:57:48.765
- You can go!
- We have rules to keep. - Go!

1238
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.506
We have rules here.

1239
00:57:50.531 --> 00:57:53.999
Pull up the case higher. You
have to pull it up higher.

1240
00:57:54.445 --> 00:57:56.999
Hold onto the bottom of the case.

1241
00:57:57.156 --> 00:57:58.937
(Confusion and chaos)

1242
00:57:59.297 --> 00:58:01.726
- You need to hurry.
- Hold towards the bottom of the case.

1243
00:58:01.968 --> 00:58:03.566
You can take your time.

1244
00:58:03.711 --> 00:58:05.351
Hold it up, pull up the zipper.

1245
00:58:05.625 --> 00:58:07.030
You have to put your feet in.

1246
00:58:07.054 --> 00:58:10.154
- He's ahead of you.
- Jump longer. Have bigger strides.

1247
00:58:10.179 --> 00:58:12.052
He didn't even pull up the zipper.

1248
00:58:12.078 --> 00:58:13.078
(Collision)

1249
00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.160
Good, good.

1250
00:58:14.742 --> 00:58:16.304
What are we doing?

1251
00:58:16.508 --> 00:58:17.984
Is it my turn now?

1252
00:58:18.164 --> 00:58:21.234
Soo-geun! Soo-geun. Take
it and start running!

1253
00:58:21.843 --> 00:58:24.207
Hurry, pull up the zipper.
Pull up the zipper.

1254
00:58:24.232 --> 00:58:26.241
- Am I zipped up?
- Are you done zipping me up?

1255
00:58:26.265 --> 00:58:28.340
- You're done.
- I'm good to go!

1256
00:58:28.994 --> 00:58:31.437
(He purposely gets in Ha-nui's way)

1257
00:58:32.027 --> 00:58:33.592
You should use your words.

1258
00:58:33.734 --> 00:58:36.429
You have to pay for our
jajangmyeon delivery.

1259
00:58:36.771 --> 00:58:38.234
We won! We won.

1260
00:58:38.411 --> 00:58:41.265
Keep going, Ha-nui. You
have to finish the race.

1261
00:58:41.326 --> 00:58:44.614
- You can't fall over. Don't fall.
- You can push him aside.

1262
00:58:45.732 --> 00:58:46.732
(Easy-going)

1263
00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:48.691
They're starting to fight now.

1264
00:58:48.716 --> 00:58:50.773
- Hold on.
- It'll be disaster if he falls.

1265
00:58:50.896 --> 00:58:52.480
No, that's not what I meant!

1266
00:58:52.505 --> 00:58:53.988
It'll be disaster if he falls.

1267
00:58:54.013 --> 00:58:55.488
(Wow, thank you)

1268
00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:57.645
(Soo-geun wins with Ha-nui's help)

1269
00:58:57.865 --> 00:58:59.794
Jang-hoon cheated first.

1270
00:59:00.927 --> 00:59:02.394
Jang-hoon cheated first.

1271
00:59:02.576 --> 00:59:05.388
- This is a variety show.
- We're on a variety show!

1272
00:59:05.998 --> 00:59:08.864
This was our practice game.
It was just for practice.

1273
00:59:08.888 --> 00:59:09.888
From this point on...

1274
00:59:10.201 --> 00:59:14.591
- It was practice. - We'll accept her
wishes. This time, let's play really dirty.

1275
00:59:15.154 --> 00:59:17.013
- Cheat all you can.
- Really?

1276
00:59:17.185 --> 00:59:20.270
- It'll be a survival race.
- Really? Okay. Let's let them have it.

1277
00:59:20.412 --> 00:59:21.785
- Okay, okay.
- Alright?

1278
00:59:21.911 --> 00:59:23.535
- Spin-off.
- Spin-off.

1279
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.332
- Sounds good, a spin-off.
- Okay, spin-off.

1280
00:59:25.482 --> 00:59:27.966
This spin-off could become a regular game.

1281
00:59:28.419 --> 00:59:30.539
- Kyung-hoon is dangerous.
- Play as dirty as you can.

1282
00:59:30.599 --> 00:59:35.028
Watch me, Kyung-hoon. You won't
get hurt if you pull on the case.

1283
00:59:35.326 --> 00:59:38.466
It looked dangerous since
you were holding it so low.

1284
00:59:38.685 --> 00:59:41.606
- I'll do what I want.
- Okay, you do that.

1285
00:59:42.091 --> 00:59:43.091
Leave him alone.

1286
00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:45.060
Why don't you crawl there?

1287
00:59:45.427 --> 00:59:48.083
Ho-dong, play as dirty as you can.

1288
00:59:48.232 --> 00:59:50.224
Make one of them faint.

1289
00:59:50.498 --> 00:59:53.246
You have an opportunity to
show us something scary.

1290
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:55.097
You've been joking around too much.

1291
00:59:55.388 --> 00:59:57.411
Do anything you want that's
allowed on television.

1292
00:59:57.497 --> 00:59:59.864
- We can shove.
- Can't we hold onto them?

1293
01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.950
- You can't do that.
- I can lasso you guys like this.

1294
01:00:03.919 --> 01:00:05.179
No, you can't do that.

1295
01:00:05.357 --> 01:00:07.216
Try it if you can do it, Ho-dong.

1296
01:00:08.123 --> 01:00:10.879
- Let's do this.
- Where do you think you're looking?

1297
01:00:11.427 --> 01:00:13.019
My goodness, such a creep.

1298
01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:14.402
Get ready. Start.

1299
01:00:14.427 --> 01:00:16.606
Hurry. Hurry to the midpoint.

1300
01:00:16.943 --> 01:00:19.880
Hurry and when you come back,
I'll give him a side-kick.

1301
01:00:20.036 --> 01:00:22.997
Hurry! He's catching up to you.
He's going to get you!

1302
01:00:23.373 --> 01:00:24.731
(I'll catch you, no matter what)

1303
01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:26.261
That's good, that's good.

1304
01:00:26.287 --> 01:00:27.864
Turn around, Hee-chul!

1305
01:00:28.426 --> 01:00:30.000
(Someone save Hee-chul)

1306
01:00:30.435 --> 01:00:31.435
That's good.

1307
01:00:32.482 --> 01:00:33.746
Come this way!

1308
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:35.380
(Scared to death)

1309
01:00:36.113 --> 01:00:38.621
- Be careful, careful.
- Let's hurry up.

1310
01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:42.450
- You have to hurry up.
- Good job, good job.

1311
01:00:42.755 --> 01:00:44.152
Why is everyone so good?

1312
01:00:44.399 --> 01:00:47.136
(The two hassle one
another at the midpoint)

1313
01:00:47.724 --> 01:00:49.097
It's a battle of stamina.

1314
01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:51.411
That's it! We're going to win!

1315
01:00:51.443 --> 01:00:52.770
It's a battle of stamina.

1316
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:56.091
- That's it! We're going to win!
- Hurry back in!

1317
01:00:56.373 --> 01:00:57.373
(Laughing)

1318
01:00:57.552 --> 01:00:59.747
- What are you doing?
- You didn't turn.

1319
01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:02.325
You didn't go around the midpoint.

1320
01:01:02.482 --> 01:01:03.812
We win. We win.

1321
01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:06.513
- You did well.
- We win.

1322
01:01:06.826 --> 01:01:08.575
Wait for him, go easy on us.

1323
01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:10.833
(Crashes in)

1324
01:01:11.449 --> 01:01:13.422
(Yeong-cheol tries to stop the giant)

1325
01:01:13.529 --> 01:01:14.945
You hit me first.

1326
01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:17.336
He purposely bumped into me.

1327
01:01:17.361 --> 01:01:19.090
Come back in, Jang-hoon!

1328
01:01:21.263 --> 01:01:22.847
Come back in, Jang-hoon.

1329
01:01:23.771 --> 01:01:24.902
(Turns away)

1330
01:01:25.669 --> 01:01:27.356
This makes me so mad. Geez.

1331
01:01:27.677 --> 01:01:28.677
Just a little more.

1332
01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:31.911
- Good job, good job.
- Come in all the way!

1333
01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:35.965
(Only one person per team is left)

1334
01:01:37.865 --> 01:01:39.148
(Laying down)

1335
01:01:39.834 --> 01:01:40.834
(Looking around)

1336
01:01:40.927 --> 01:01:43.011
- What are you doing?
- Jump over me.

1337
01:01:43.146 --> 01:01:44.527
- Hands! Hands!
- No, I didn't.

1338
01:01:44.552 --> 01:01:47.513
- I'm only stopping you from going forward.
- Okay.

1339
01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.060
(Tries harder)

1340
01:01:49.326 --> 01:01:51.187
You're stronger than I thought.

1341
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.380
(Pushes again)

1342
01:01:52.657 --> 01:01:54.453
(Thank you for pushing me)

1343
01:01:55.076 --> 01:01:57.390
The more you hit me, the faster I'll go.

1344
01:01:57.646 --> 01:02:00.468
(She can't catch up to
Soo-geun, who is annoying her)

1345
01:02:00.677 --> 01:02:02.645
Push him. Push him with your butt.

1346
01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.754
Can I get some music?

1347
01:02:04.951 --> 01:02:07.250
I feel like I'm joking
with my older sister.

1348
01:02:07.607 --> 01:02:09.910
She could be your older
sister based on her height.

1349
01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:11.935
Push him and run away, Ha-nui.

1350
01:02:17.224 --> 01:02:19.988
(Soo-geun gets totally faked-out by Ha-nui)

1351
01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:24.004
(A horrible ending to
the king of annoyance)

1352
01:02:26.263 --> 01:02:27.433
You're so stupid!

1353
01:02:27.615 --> 01:02:28.732
(Ha-nui wins)

1354
01:02:28.904 --> 01:02:30.312
She's really good.

1355
01:02:30.568 --> 01:02:32.152
I really didn't know that would happen.

1356
01:02:32.177 --> 01:02:33.872
I swear to the heavens.

1357
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:37.560
I thought she was going to
push me back, I really did.

1358
01:02:37.693 --> 01:02:39.216
I can't believe we won.

1359
01:02:39.615 --> 01:02:42.270
- This was pretty fun.
- Jajangmyeon!

1360
01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:43.748
Let's go eat jajangmyeon!

1361
01:02:44.083 --> 01:02:46.501
I really didn't think she'd do that.

1362
01:02:48.219 --> 01:02:52.146
(A mansion that looks extravagant
but somewhat spooky)

1363
01:02:52.865 --> 01:02:55.294
(The mansion is silent)

1364
01:02:56.224 --> 01:02:58.044
Let go! Let go!

1365
01:02:58.623 --> 01:03:00.509
You'd better let go! Let go of me!

1366
01:03:00.857 --> 01:03:03.989
Did you two wash your hands
before holding onto me?

1367
01:03:04.427 --> 01:03:06.138
I'm sensitive to cleanliness.

1368
01:03:06.763 --> 01:03:07.763
Where am I?

1369
01:03:08.357 --> 01:03:09.357
Where am I?

1370
01:03:10.255 --> 01:03:11.380
(Surprised)

1371
01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:16.497
Did I just get kidnapped from them?
That makes no sense. Who, me?

1372
01:03:17.724 --> 01:03:20.271
I'm so taken aback. But, where am I?

1373
01:03:22.513 --> 01:03:24.275
This place is so luxurious.

1374
01:03:25.037 --> 01:03:27.825
- Hey!
- I can't see anything.

1375
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:30.067
- Can someone guide me?
- Where are we?

1376
01:03:30.092 --> 01:03:32.058
Did you put a blindfold on me?

1377
01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:34.755
Wait a second! Where are
you guys taking me?

1378
01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.488
I can see with my psychic powers.

1379
01:03:36.513 --> 01:03:39.380
Where are you taking us? Are
we doing a guerrilla concert?

1380
01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:42.333
I'm asking who put these blindfolds on me.

1381
01:03:42.623 --> 01:03:44.762
- Wait, stop it.
- I asked, who put this blindfold on me.

1382
01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.536
Is there free food somewhere?

1383
01:03:46.677 --> 01:03:49.145
Are you giving me a
surprise birthday party?

1384
01:03:49.302 --> 01:03:52.466
- Is there a special event?-
- Why are we all here?

1385
01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.114
- What's this?
- What's all this?

1386
01:03:55.263 --> 01:03:57.457
- Where are we?
- Wow, it's clean here.

1387
01:03:57.482 --> 01:03:59.903
- Who are all these bums?
- Wow, it's clean here.

1388
01:04:00.037 --> 01:04:02.528
- Who is he?
- Why was I brought here?

1389
01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.665
- You shouldn't be here, sir.
- Where am I?

1390
01:04:05.904 --> 01:04:08.114
Free meal tickets are over there.

1391
01:04:08.419 --> 01:04:10.708
I have something for you.
It's very precious to me.

1392
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.990
(Searching)

1393
01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.989
- Don't say such mean things.
- I want to try that too.

1394
01:04:17.935 --> 01:04:19.222
He always gets fooled by that.

1395
01:04:19.247 --> 01:04:22.613
- I want to try it too. - Would you
like one? It's my prized possession.

1396
01:04:22.638 --> 01:04:24.138
I've been saving it.

1397
01:04:24.287 --> 01:04:26.443
- Aren't you that guy?
- Who?

1398
01:04:27.162 --> 01:04:28.520
I saw you at Seoul Station.

1399
01:04:28.544 --> 01:04:31.395
I don't think you're a
bum from our country.

1400
01:04:32.099 --> 01:04:34.496
How can you call me a bum?
Gross, that was my hair.

1401
01:04:34.521 --> 01:04:36.278
Where are we though?

1402
01:04:36.318 --> 01:04:38.161
Why were we dragged here?

1403
01:04:38.513 --> 01:04:41.622
- I know. - I don't think the
guys here are all normal.

1404
01:04:41.951 --> 01:04:43.720
Don't I seem the most normal here?

1405
01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:45.540
You guys look really strange.

1406
01:04:45.771 --> 01:04:49.505
- What going on? - I'm scared!
You're scaring Ho-dong! Let go!

1407
01:04:49.662 --> 01:04:50.662
Let go of me!

1408
01:04:50.755 --> 01:04:53.574
- His clothes are clean.
- You'd better let go of me!

1409
01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:55.841
You could free yourself
without much effort.

1410
01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:58.376
You'd better let go of me! Where am I?

1411
01:04:58.693 --> 01:05:00.035
I can't see anything.

1412
01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.308
The blindfold actually covers his face.

1413
01:05:01.333 --> 01:05:04.794
You're going to be in big trouble!
Ho-dong is scared!

1414
01:05:06.271 --> 01:05:08.590
Why do you keep wearing that same wig?

1415
01:05:08.615 --> 01:05:11.208
- Hello.
- Is that wig your new trademark?

1416
01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:13.981
- Are you going to keep using that wig?
- His hair changed again.

1417
01:05:14.005 --> 01:05:16.958
Why were we all dragged here?

1418
01:05:17.044 --> 01:05:19.286
Who are you guys and what do you do?

1419
01:05:19.419 --> 01:05:22.575
- Why did they suddenly drag us here?
- Who are you guys?

1420
01:05:22.646 --> 01:05:24.755
All the neighborhood bums are here.

1421
01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:26.661
Let's hurry and run away.

1422
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:29.653
- Let's go. - I don't want to.
It's nice and clean here.

1423
01:05:29.868 --> 01:05:32.302
- Have we been captured?
- I can't stay here with you guys.

1424
01:05:32.451 --> 01:05:34.841
- I saw bodyguards here.
- Can we get out that way?

1425
01:05:34.935 --> 01:05:36.638
It's so luxurious here.

1426
01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:37.958
I like it here.

1427
01:05:38.982 --> 01:05:39.982
Who is she?

1428
01:05:41.129 --> 01:05:43.608
I see everyone is here.
Please, have a seat.

1429
01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:44.739
Sit down.

1430
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.990
She's pretty.

1431
01:05:46.701 --> 01:05:48.396
- Come here.
- Who are you?

1432
01:05:48.623 --> 01:05:50.560
I own this mansion.

1433
01:05:51.279 --> 01:05:53.325
Why did you bring us here?

1434
01:05:53.537 --> 01:05:57.122
You all look pretty bad for
suddenly being dragged here...

1435
01:05:57.505 --> 01:06:00.404
but you have the freedom
to leave, if you want to.

1436
01:06:00.429 --> 01:06:03.660
But! You should decide after you
listen to what I have to say.

1437
01:06:03.685 --> 01:06:05.872
- I want to leave.
- Me too, I want to leave.

1438
01:06:05.958 --> 01:06:09.942
- I don't need to be here either.
- I actually kind of like it here.

1439
01:06:10.731 --> 01:06:13.692
- I'll decide after I hear what she says.
- Me too, I'll sit here for a while.

1440
01:06:13.763 --> 01:06:15.449
I should leave, it's not my house.

1441
01:06:15.474 --> 01:06:17.505
The reason I brought all of you here is...

1442
01:06:17.716 --> 01:06:20.716
to find my long-lost brother
I lost when I was young.

1443
01:06:21.396 --> 01:06:23.946
- Your older brother?
- I had a younger sister.

1444
01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:25.730
- I had a younger sister.
- Hold on.

1445
01:06:25.755 --> 01:06:27.090
I had a younger sister.

1446
01:06:27.115 --> 01:06:29.841
I brought dried seaweed for her.

1447
01:06:30.154 --> 01:06:33.310
My father passed away recently,
but left us his inheritance.

1448
01:06:33.458 --> 01:06:36.161
- (Quickly sits back down)
- Inheritance! Inheritance!

1449
01:06:36.466 --> 01:06:38.708
Keep talking, my little sister.

1450
01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:42.036
My father demanded I share his
inheritance with my brother.

1451
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.958
Half of it. You need to share half.

1452
01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:46.427
I asked around to look for my brother.

1453
01:06:46.646 --> 01:06:49.638
All of you could be my older brother.

1454
01:06:49.693 --> 01:06:51.948
- One of us could be your real brother?
- Yes.

1455
01:06:51.973 --> 01:06:53.653
You're not her brother, I am.

1456
01:06:53.755 --> 01:06:56.480
- I'm her brother. - How can you be so
sure when you didn't know all this time?

1457
01:06:56.505 --> 01:06:58.544
- No, you're not.
- I knew I was her brother.

1458
01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.310
Who is my older brother?

1459
01:07:00.466 --> 01:07:03.466
Your older brother is me! It's me!

1460
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:05.630
I finally found my long-lost sister.

1461
01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:08.575
Didn't you marry her older sister?

1462
01:07:08.717 --> 01:07:09.717
(What?)

1463
01:07:11.076 --> 01:07:14.681
Do you know how long I've looked for you?
Don't you remember me?

1464
01:07:14.904 --> 01:07:18.770
- You don't look alike.
- Look! We look exactly the same!

1465
01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:22.400
I used to walk you to the bathroom
at night when you needed to go.

1466
01:07:22.482 --> 01:07:26.517
Don't you remember? You used to dance
like a crab in front of me, too.

1467
01:07:26.966 --> 01:07:29.927
- Try dancing! - I think I remember.
- That's right!

1468
01:07:31.373 --> 01:07:34.997
She's hungry, she's hungry.
My little sister is hungry.

1469
01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.107
- She's hungry.
- I think I remember.

1470
01:07:37.132 --> 01:07:39.333
- I'm not hungry, you bum!
- It's me!

1471
01:07:39.411 --> 01:07:43.942
(I now know the feeling of being alone)

1472
01:07:44.146 --> 01:07:47.107
(It was all a mistake)

1473
01:07:47.498 --> 01:07:51.099
(She naturally dances along
with his sudden singing)

1474
01:07:52.388 --> 01:07:54.394
Do you think she's Kim Ji-hyun?

1475
01:07:54.419 --> 01:07:56.738
Don't you remember dancing
with me when we were younger?

1476
01:07:56.763 --> 01:07:59.310
- I had a bruise here.
- That's right!

1477
01:07:59.841 --> 01:08:01.794
- I'm her older brother!
- Sang-min!

1478
01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:03.677
You can't believe them, Ha-nui!

1479
01:08:03.841 --> 01:08:05.722
- You look like an ostrich.
- Oh, Ha-nui!

1480
01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.731
- Let me hug you!
- Okay.

1481
01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:10.269
How dare you try to make a move?

1482
01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:12.700
Ha-nui is my little sister. Watch!

1483
01:08:12.787 --> 01:08:14.661
Can you smile for me, Ha-nui?

1484
01:08:15.904 --> 01:08:17.880
Look at our dimples!

1485
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.372
- It's the same as mine.
- Dimples!

1486
01:08:20.482 --> 01:08:23.333
Our dimples are deep
enough to carry our lunch.

1487
01:08:24.193 --> 01:08:26.169
How can he say such bold-faced lies?

1488
01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:29.193
- You must be kidding me.
- I can't believe him.

1489
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:31.009
(Even Jang-hoon is embarrassed for him)

1490
01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.064
(I didn't take you for that kind of person)

1491
01:08:33.115 --> 01:08:35.911
Any which way! You're my little sister!

1492
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:39.263
- No, she's my little sister.
- I have such faint memories.

1493
01:08:39.294 --> 01:08:40.732
She's my little sister!

1494
01:08:40.896 --> 01:08:43.724
No, she's my real sister. Look at them!

1495
01:08:44.263 --> 01:08:46.622
Is your face more like a dog or like a cat?

1496
01:08:46.716 --> 01:08:48.431
You look more like a pig!

1497
01:08:48.685 --> 01:08:50.681
Pig. Pig. Pig. Pig.

1498
01:08:50.935 --> 01:08:52.325
We look like pigs.

1499
01:08:52.685 --> 01:08:53.685
(Surprised)

1500
01:08:53.998 --> 01:08:56.255
I told you not to say that.

1501
01:08:56.419 --> 01:08:59.403
- I'm only stating the facts.
- She's my little sister.

1502
01:08:59.552 --> 01:09:01.895
Tell us why you think she's your sister.

1503
01:09:01.982 --> 01:09:05.395
Kimbab. She likes kimbab.
My sister is so pretty.

1504
01:09:05.537 --> 01:09:07.160
- You shouldn't eat that!
- I shouldn't?

1505
01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:10.707
Can't the bodyguards give him a
meal ticket and send him away?

1506
01:09:10.732 --> 01:09:12.082
That kimbab is five-years-old.

1507
01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:14.340
I've been saving this,
but I'll give it to you.

1508
01:09:14.365 --> 01:09:15.365
(Slaps)

1509
01:09:17.701 --> 01:09:19.568
He gets fooled all the time.

1510
01:09:19.841 --> 01:09:22.566
You had an older brother, who
is shorter than you, Ha-nui.

1511
01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:26.341
- A shorter brother? - You're tall,
so all our friends made fun of me.

1512
01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:29.021
Ha-nui was really ugly when she was young.

1513
01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:32.254
People say kids, who are ugly, grow
to be pretty when they're old.

1514
01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:35.466
I still can't stop myself from laughing
when I think how ugly you were.

1515
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:36.739
How ugly was she?

1516
01:09:36.841 --> 01:09:39.653
She was as ugly as him when she was young.

1517
01:09:39.794 --> 01:09:42.583
- Wait a minute.
- He's not her real brother!

1518
01:09:42.724 --> 01:09:45.613
- She's been pretty all her life.
- I can't see our family genes in you.

1519
01:09:45.638 --> 01:09:47.895
Take a close look at my face.
You'll remember.

1520
01:09:47.998 --> 01:09:50.013
I don't think he remembers, who he is.

1521
01:09:50.123 --> 01:09:54.278
Dad used to ask why his son looked like a
damned bum. That's why I became a bum.

1522
01:09:54.349 --> 01:09:57.661
- I remember dad saying that.
- That's why I became like this.

1523
01:09:57.802 --> 01:10:00.786
But Ha-nui is pretty. I
have to give Ha-nui kimbab.

1524
01:10:01.232 --> 01:10:04.200
I have kimbab, candy and chocolate.

1525
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:06.689
I have something else for you, Jang-hoon.

1526
01:10:07.052 --> 01:10:09.005
Show us one more time. One last time.

1527
01:10:09.162 --> 01:10:10.462
Show us one more time.

1528
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:12.310
I'll kill you if you do it again.

1529
01:10:12.388 --> 01:10:13.855
I won't let you get away with it!

1530
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.433
What are these bums thinking?
Look at our faces, we look alike.

1531
01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:20.591
Ha-nui! When you were young and
suffered from depression...

1532
01:10:21.349 --> 01:10:23.802
I sang all the time to make you laugh.

1533
01:10:23.998 --> 01:10:28.286
(Up, down, up, up and down)

1534
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:29.669
That's dirty.

1535
01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.775
That is dirty. He's a bum.

1536
01:10:31.888 --> 01:10:36.067
- He's a dirty bum. - You're not mistaking
me for that other Hani, are you?

1537
01:10:36.373 --> 01:10:39.013
That's Hani and I'm Ha-nui.

1538
01:10:39.341 --> 01:10:41.550
- He didn't know.
- You caught him!

1539
01:10:41.576 --> 01:10:42.957
You're the Hani's brother, not her brother!

1540
01:10:42.982 --> 01:10:46.481
- Your name isn't Hani?
- No, it's Ha-nui.

1541
01:10:47.005 --> 01:10:48.864
You're not her brother, Hee-chul!

1542
01:10:49.123 --> 01:10:51.075
- Go away!
- Then, what's your name?

1543
01:10:51.732 --> 01:10:53.786
Do you know, who I am?

1544
01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.083
Geez, seriously!

1545
01:10:55.458 --> 01:10:56.810
You're hurting me!

1546
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.990
Ha-nui!

1547
01:10:59.591 --> 01:11:02.489
- Next person, please.
- Watch me carefully, Ha-nui.

1548
01:11:03.114 --> 01:11:06.497
(I'm your older brother.
Your older brother!)

1549
01:11:06.982 --> 01:11:11.310
Security guard! He can't be my brother.
No one in my family looks like this.

1550
01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.493
- Take him away.
- Don't be like that, Ha-nui!

1551
01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:16.552
- Try smiling, Ha-nui.
- Me?

1552
01:11:16.638 --> 01:11:18.801
- Try smiling.
- It's a fact that they're not related.

1553
01:11:18.826 --> 01:11:20.747
Try smiling broadly, like this.

1554
01:11:21.287 --> 01:11:24.607
Do you see? You and I both
have the same scarlet gum-line.

1555
01:11:25.326 --> 01:11:26.810
I won't let go of you.

1556
01:11:27.372 --> 01:11:28.927
He's driving me crazy.

1557
01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:33.395
You need to be serious about this, Ha-nui.
Think very carefully.

1558
01:11:33.716 --> 01:11:35.001
Alright, alright.

1559
01:11:35.287 --> 01:11:37.403
I've heard from all of you.

1560
01:11:37.654 --> 01:11:42.130
Fortunately, dad left me some decisive
clues to finding my real brother.

1561
01:11:42.482 --> 01:11:47.177
- Great! - I'll see who my real
brother is through those tests.

1562
01:11:47.841 --> 01:11:52.864
The first clue my dad gave me was
that my brother was sort of a rebel.

1563
01:11:53.321 --> 01:11:55.564
Can't we test each to see who
the biggest rebel would be?

1564
01:11:55.654 --> 01:11:56.708
A rebel.

1565
01:11:56.849 --> 01:11:59.802
Great, Ho-dong! That's a great idea!

1566
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.247
I'll test everyone here to
see who the real rebel is.

1567
01:12:03.529 --> 01:12:05.684
- Good. - Do you all know
the cham, cham, cham game?

1568
01:12:05.708 --> 01:12:09.145
- Yes, we do! - Let's play the
rebel version of cham, cham, cham.

1569
01:12:09.248 --> 01:12:12.059
If you want to win, you'll follow my
fingers instead of going the other way.

1570
01:12:12.083 --> 01:12:15.044
You'll pass the test if you
can get five in a row.

1571
01:12:15.318 --> 01:12:18.884
- I think my real brother might be
able to do that. - You're right.

1572
01:12:18.998 --> 01:12:21.810
- I played this game a lot
when I was young. - Me too.

1573
01:12:21.826 --> 01:12:23.849
You can't stay still. You have to move.

1574
01:12:23.874 --> 01:12:25.347
You have to move, no matter what.

1575
01:12:25.373 --> 01:12:27.450
- You need five in a row?
- It has to be the same direction.

1576
01:12:27.474 --> 01:12:29.324
- How many times?
- Five times.

1577
01:12:29.349 --> 01:12:31.153
- In a row? - Yeah.
- I'm going first!

1578
01:12:31.333 --> 01:12:33.614
- Let's try this.
- Let's go.

1579
01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.138
- Cham, cham, cham!
- Hold on.

1580
01:12:36.201 --> 01:12:38.403
- Wait a second!
- Next! You're out!

1581
01:12:38.513 --> 01:12:40.638
Next person! You're out. Come sit down.

1582
01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:43.466
- Go in the same direction!
- Let's see how well you do.

1583
01:12:43.771 --> 01:12:45.685
- My sister!
- Go ahead and watch.

1584
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:47.191
My sister, I'm your brother.

1585
01:12:47.216 --> 01:12:50.013
- You're my older brother?
- Of course, I'm your older brother.

1586
01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:52.079
Cham, cham, cham!

1587
01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.384
- He was a bit late.
- He was.

1588
01:12:54.958 --> 01:12:56.989
(He passes the second time as well)

1589
01:12:58.013 --> 01:13:00.020
You really are my sister!

1590
01:13:01.724 --> 01:13:02.724
Brother!

1591
01:13:04.099 --> 01:13:05.535
(Somehow, she doesn't seem pleased)

1592
01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.911
- I'm your brother, aren't I?
- You have two more tries.

1593
01:13:08.044 --> 01:13:09.727
Cham, cham, cham!

1594
01:13:09.763 --> 01:13:11.519
- You're out!
- Come sit down.

1595
01:13:11.544 --> 01:13:12.544
(Punches him)

1596
01:13:13.794 --> 01:13:16.036
- Get out of here.
- We need to hurry up.

1597
01:13:16.154 --> 01:13:17.442
Cham, cham, cham!

1598
01:13:17.513 --> 01:13:19.403
- Let's go.
- Cham, cham, cham!

1599
01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.740
Get out of here!

1600
01:13:21.154 --> 01:13:22.154
Next person.

1601
01:13:23.294 --> 01:13:24.536
Cham, cham, cham!

1602
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:25.630
Get out of here.

1603
01:13:26.107 --> 01:13:28.270
Ha-nui! I'm your brother.

1604
01:13:28.544 --> 01:13:32.294
- We should all stand in line.
- Go in order, go in order.

1605
01:13:32.802 --> 01:13:35.528
- You can't go again!
- You need to go fast.

1606
01:13:35.623 --> 01:13:37.481
- Cham, cham, cham!
- Next!

1607
01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:38.630
Good try.

1608
01:13:40.998 --> 01:13:43.262
- Lower your hand for him.
- Okay, I'll lower my stance.

1609
01:13:43.287 --> 01:13:45.560
- She's my sister.
- Let's try it.

1610
01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.395
- I've never seen him around.
- Cham, cham, cham! - I got this.

1611
01:13:48.552 --> 01:13:50.849
- What are you doing?
- I got this.

1612
01:13:51.216 --> 01:13:53.532
Why are you looking at my breasts?

1613
01:13:54.287 --> 01:13:55.966
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

1614
01:13:56.255 --> 01:13:57.255
Why? Why?

1615
01:13:57.310 --> 01:14:00.707
Wait! Look from my height. I'm
not purposely looking there.

1616
01:14:00.732 --> 01:14:04.099
I didn't do anything wrong.
I'm just looking straight.

1617
01:14:04.419 --> 01:14:07.341
- Can you stop hitting me?
- Something is wrong with him.

1618
01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:10.606
- I'm just looking forward. Go higher.
- Okay.

1619
01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:13.368
- Cham, cham, cham!
- I can get everything right.

1620
01:14:13.393 --> 01:14:16.548
- Cham, cham, cham! - I can get
everything right. I'll go first.

1621
01:14:16.755 --> 01:14:19.255
I'll turn first, you can follow me, sis'.

1622
01:14:19.451 --> 01:14:20.451
Cham, cham, cham!

1623
01:14:20.638 --> 01:14:22.477
(He gets out on the third try)

1624
01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:24.356
- My sister!
- Let's go.

1625
01:14:25.005 --> 01:14:26.614
Here. Cham, cham, cham!

1626
01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.582
- You're out.
- You're out, stand back here.

1627
01:14:29.607 --> 01:14:31.739
- Hurry, hurry it up!
- We're going again?

1628
01:14:31.873 --> 01:14:32.873
Only three times now.

1629
01:14:33.162 --> 01:14:36.700
- We only need to do it three times
in a row. - Cham, cham, cham!

1630
01:14:36.926 --> 01:14:39.794
- Hit him as hard as you can.
- Get out.

1631
01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.024
- Cham, cham, cham!
- Hit him hard!

1632
01:14:42.146 --> 01:14:45.204
- You need to him them harder.
- Take off your glasses.

1633
01:14:45.904 --> 01:14:46.904
Cham, cham, cham!

1634
01:14:47.646 --> 01:14:50.677
- Cham, cham, cham!
- He got it wrong. - This is hard.

1635
01:14:50.998 --> 01:14:51.998
Cham, cham, cham!

1636
01:14:52.107 --> 01:14:54.497
- One-time. - Cham, cham, cham!
- Two-times!

1637
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:56.329
Cham, cham, cham!

1638
01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.267
(Ho-dong wins)

1639
01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:01.538
This can't be right!

1640
01:15:01.919 --> 01:15:04.028
(Ho-dong is my real brother?)

1641
01:15:06.107 --> 01:15:07.724
Yes, bow down to me!

1642
01:15:08.016 --> 01:15:10.383
- You do look like a pig.
- I think so too.

1643
01:15:11.743 --> 01:15:14.056
I wonder how big their inheritance is.

1644
01:15:14.188 --> 01:15:15.781
How big is the inheritance?

1645
01:15:16.016 --> 01:15:18.563
It's bigger than you can ever imagine.

1646
01:15:18.946 --> 01:15:20.244
Is it over a billion dollars?

1647
01:15:20.269 --> 01:15:23.583
It's not that much, but it'll
be enough to pay your debt.

1648
01:15:24.172 --> 01:15:26.161
Jang-hoon has more than that.

1649
01:15:26.305 --> 01:15:29.083
You can be my sister and
I'll just give you my half.

1650
01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:31.664
- I have about a billion.
- I'll be your brother.

1651
01:15:31.837 --> 01:15:35.281
- He's exaggerating his assets.
- Your assets grew since I last saw you.

1652
01:15:35.508 --> 01:15:37.217
Billion-dollar man, I'll be your brother.

1653
01:15:37.243 --> 01:15:40.695
Ho-dong seems the most rebellious
by being the green frog but...

1654
01:15:40.719 --> 01:15:43.352
- He doesn't look like a frog!
- More like a bullfrog.

1655
01:15:43.618 --> 01:15:44.992
He breaks the ecosystem.

1656
01:15:45.087 --> 01:15:47.258
We can't come to a conclusion yet.

1657
01:15:47.391 --> 01:15:50.133
My father left me another clue.

1658
01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:54.164
My real brother knows everything about me.

1659
01:15:54.805 --> 01:15:57.927
My brother knows what I
want, what I'm thinking...

1660
01:15:57.952 --> 01:16:01.266
and what I want to say just
by looking at my eyes.

1661
01:16:01.469 --> 01:16:03.880
- Of course, I know.
- I know everything.

1662
01:16:04.087 --> 01:16:06.320
I'm going to ask you a
couple of question...

1663
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:09.195
but I already wrote down all my answers.

1664
01:16:09.883 --> 01:16:13.774
Try to guess exactly what I
wrote down as my answers.

1665
01:16:14.032 --> 01:16:15.888
I'll ask my first question.

1666
01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:21.750
If a friend were to ask to borrow a large sum
of money without asking any questions...

1667
01:16:22.329 --> 01:16:24.891
what would Ha-nui do, in the end?

1668
01:16:24.922 --> 01:16:27.880
I got it! She'd give 1/100
of the amount requested.

1669
01:16:28.008 --> 01:16:29.922
I'd let them have it? Nope.

1670
01:16:30.172 --> 01:16:32.328
- You'd take a promissory note.
- Nope.

1671
01:16:32.547 --> 01:16:37.547
- You could lose a friend over
money, so you deny them. - Nope.

1672
01:16:37.852 --> 01:16:40.024
- You let them borrow on a high interest.
- Nope.

1673
01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:42.813
- You use body parts as insurance.
- Which body part?

1674
01:16:43.008 --> 01:16:44.688
- An organ.
- Nope.

1675
01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.192
I'll give you a hint.

1676
01:16:46.774 --> 01:16:49.219
They asked me to not to ask or comment...

1677
01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:53.039
- You ask them questions and
comment on their loan. - Wow!

1678
01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:55.867
He's right.

1679
01:16:57.672 --> 01:17:00.531
I know exactly what my
little sister is thinking!

1680
01:17:00.985 --> 01:17:03.727
Wait a second. You bury them first?

1681
01:17:04.321 --> 01:17:07.196
- You would bury them?
- And open their neck.

1682
01:17:07.704 --> 01:17:09.695
- She's a criminal!
- You'd open their neck?

1683
01:17:09.719 --> 01:17:12.194
I'm too scared to look for my sister.
I'm leaving.

1684
01:17:12.219 --> 01:17:15.225
You'd better sit down before I
cut your neck open and bury you.

1685
01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:17.360
- She uses dialects really well.
- I know.

1686
01:17:17.477 --> 01:17:20.602
It's very probable that
Ho-dong is my real brother.

1687
01:17:20.704 --> 01:17:22.172
He's like a green frog.

1688
01:17:22.415 --> 01:17:24.872
- Next question.
- She's good about lending money.

1689
01:17:25.126 --> 01:17:26.829
No, you shouldn't do that.

1690
01:17:26.946 --> 01:17:30.163
- I was cheated a lot. - You shouldn't
lend money when your brother is a bum.

1691
01:17:30.188 --> 01:17:31.997
You should've taken care of your brother.

1692
01:17:32.055 --> 01:17:35.211
Let's say Ha-nui was in a full
elevator when she farted.

1693
01:17:35.594 --> 01:17:37.992
The whole elevator reeked of her stench.

1694
01:17:38.368 --> 01:17:39.789
How would Ha-nui react?

1695
01:17:39.993 --> 01:17:41.700
I think she'd be honest. I got it!

1696
01:17:41.868 --> 01:17:43.633
- "I farted".
- You're wrong.

1697
01:17:43.883 --> 01:17:46.919
I got it. You'd slap the person next
to you and say, "What are you doing?".

1698
01:17:46.944 --> 01:17:49.234
- "You're in a crowded elevator!".
- No, that's wrong.

1699
01:17:49.243 --> 01:17:53.836
I got it. You farted, but you'd look
to the person next to you and do this.

1700
01:17:55.047 --> 01:17:56.367
- Like this.
- I'd hold my breath?

1701
01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:57.422
- Yeah.
- Nope.

1702
01:17:57.594 --> 01:18:00.319
You'd blame it on your
manager, standing next to you.

1703
01:18:00.344 --> 01:18:03.359
"How could you fart in here?
Are you crazy?".

1704
01:18:04.087 --> 01:18:06.226
I don't like being cowardly, like that.

1705
01:18:06.251 --> 01:18:09.219
- You only get caught because
of your reaction. - No.

1706
01:18:09.399 --> 01:18:11.477
"People have such bad manners".

1707
01:18:11.844 --> 01:18:13.962
(Her unique actions get her caught)

1708
01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:17.345
You start pooping since
you've already farted.

1709
01:18:18.313 --> 01:18:19.313
No, that's wrong.

1710
01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:20.462
I got it!

1711
01:18:20.977 --> 01:18:23.836
"Everyone, get out! I'd
like to be by myself!".

1712
01:18:25.499 --> 01:18:26.882
You make a commotion.

1713
01:18:26.907 --> 01:18:28.437
- I'd make a commotion?
- Yeah.

1714
01:18:28.462 --> 01:18:33.313
I'd suddenly start yelling, "Get out! I
told you to get out! I want to be alone!".

1715
01:18:33.907 --> 01:18:35.790
No. I wouldn't say anything.

1716
01:18:36.026 --> 01:18:39.989
No, I wouldn't say anything. It's not
an action, but some sort of sound.

1717
01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:41.083
I got it.

1718
01:18:42.915 --> 01:18:45.031
(She starts smelling people next to her)

1719
01:18:45.055 --> 01:18:47.133
- No. - I got it.
- I don't say a word.

1720
01:18:47.282 --> 01:18:49.188
You'd cough.

1721
01:18:49.477 --> 01:18:51.492
You'd clear your throat.

1722
01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:54.555
- Clear my throat. You're right.
- Yeah!

1723
01:18:54.962 --> 01:18:56.796
Why would you clear your
throat if you farted?

1724
01:18:56.821 --> 01:18:58.813
Let's say I farted and it started to smell.

1725
01:18:59.126 --> 01:19:01.195
(Clearing her throat)

1726
01:19:02.001 --> 01:19:04.039
You made it more noticeable.

1727
01:19:05.117 --> 01:19:08.391
- You're telling them you farted.
- Did she fart right now, too?

1728
01:19:09.227 --> 01:19:12.531
- Why don't you just accept it?
- You should just apologize.

1729
01:19:12.751 --> 01:19:16.477
Is that what I should do? It
seems awkward to apologize.

1730
01:19:18.297 --> 01:19:19.786
(Clearing her throat)

1731
01:19:19.899 --> 01:19:22.313
Everyone can tell she's the one who farted.

1732
01:19:22.665 --> 01:19:24.992
That's kind of what Westerners would do.

1733
01:19:25.016 --> 01:19:26.422
Is this a true story?

1734
01:19:26.469 --> 01:19:28.617
- Hasn't anyone done that before?
- No.

1735
01:19:28.766 --> 01:19:30.680
- You don't?
- It's only you.

1736
01:19:30.743 --> 01:19:33.297
- We might look like this, but
we wouldn't do that. - I see.

1737
01:19:33.376 --> 01:19:35.906
- Alright.
- That makes me the most upset.

1738
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:40.227
There are some restaurants that have
men and women use the same restrooms.

1739
01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:43.718
- There are. - I would use those
restrooms and only go number one.

1740
01:19:43.743 --> 01:19:48.024
I go in and someone before me had a
bowel movement that's very stinky.

1741
01:19:48.672 --> 01:19:52.266
The stench doesn't go away and
it lingers inside the restroom.

1742
01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:54.524
The odor lingers on the walls.

1743
01:19:54.922 --> 01:19:57.070
I only used the restroom to pee.

1744
01:19:57.704 --> 01:19:59.758
A lady would be waiting outside.

1745
01:20:00.251 --> 01:20:02.625
It's not like I can tell her
the stench wasn't from me.

1746
01:20:02.719 --> 01:20:06.098
You feel obligated to flush all the
toilets that people didn't flush.

1747
01:20:06.123 --> 01:20:08.422
You even clean up the urine sprays
because of people behind you.

1748
01:20:08.493 --> 01:20:11.555
People, who work here do it as well.

1749
01:20:11.844 --> 01:20:13.344
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

1750
01:20:13.376 --> 01:20:15.789
- Let's catch them.
- I flush everyone's toilet.

1751
01:20:15.813 --> 01:20:20.453
- It's none of us. - If you think about
it, it's odors that people make.

1752
01:20:20.478 --> 01:20:22.344
- Who cares?
- It must be you, Ho-dong.

1753
01:20:22.493 --> 01:20:23.625
(We caught him)

1754
01:20:23.714 --> 01:20:26.542
- Whenever I try to use the restroom
here... - It's him, the bullfrog!

1755
01:20:26.567 --> 01:20:29.624
It's always dirty and it's never
flushed after a bowel movement!

1756
01:20:29.649 --> 01:20:31.961
- That's right. - There's always
one person that never flushes.

1757
01:20:31.986 --> 01:20:35.319
Your story of the restroom
was actually about you.

1758
01:20:35.477 --> 01:20:37.430
Why are you blaming other people?

1759
01:20:37.665 --> 01:20:40.617
Next question. I'm stranded
on a deserted island.

1760
01:20:40.883 --> 01:20:42.555
What would Ha-nui first do?

1761
01:20:43.376 --> 01:20:45.641
- She'd look for things to eat.
- No.

1762
01:20:46.024 --> 01:20:50.156
She'd find a place to keep herself safe.

1763
01:20:51.563 --> 01:20:53.359
What would I do to find such a place?

1764
01:20:53.438 --> 01:20:55.086
- You'd go look for wood!
- No.

1765
01:20:55.188 --> 01:20:57.101
- You'd find an empty space.
- No.

1766
01:20:57.126 --> 01:21:00.438
If I were to really be stranded
on a deserted island...

1767
01:21:00.594 --> 01:21:02.992
I got it! You'd go look for Kim Byung-man!

1768
01:21:03.969 --> 01:21:06.211
- I got it, didn't I?
- No, you're wrong.

1769
01:21:06.303 --> 01:21:08.938
- You'd find a sharp rock.
- No, be realistic.

1770
01:21:09.204 --> 01:21:13.250
- I wasn't trying to be funny
or make a joke. - Can I guess?

1771
01:21:13.641 --> 01:21:15.535
You go looking around the island.

1772
01:21:15.844 --> 01:21:19.617
- You're right. - That's the worst
thing you can do on a deserted island.

1773
01:21:19.688 --> 01:21:22.843
- You've been to one?
- No, I heard it on a survival show.

1774
01:21:22.868 --> 01:21:25.726
You shouldn't waste energy by
walking around the island.

1775
01:21:25.751 --> 01:21:28.555
You should immediately find
a place to make your base.

1776
01:21:28.712 --> 01:21:30.211
It's not good to move around a lot.

1777
01:21:30.329 --> 01:21:33.102
Hi. Yeah, it's me. Hi, Byung-man. Okay.

1778
01:21:33.813 --> 01:21:36.969
He says it's best not to
go to a deserted island.

1779
01:21:37.227 --> 01:21:39.992
- Byung-man is very wise.
- He just called me.

1780
01:21:40.102 --> 01:21:44.171
- It's his twin brother. - You should take
a shower if you have money for a phone.

1781
01:21:44.196 --> 01:21:45.196
(Flinches)

1782
01:21:45.407 --> 01:21:47.852
- That's a new phone.
- That's the newest technology.

1783
01:21:47.899 --> 01:21:51.500
- How does a bum have a phone?
- Are you trying to be stylish?

1784
01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:55.211
I'm sorry but I still don't
know, who my brother is.

1785
01:21:55.618 --> 01:21:57.750
What else do I need to
do for you to trust me?

1786
01:21:57.813 --> 01:22:02.266
Ha-nui! Can't you see that you and I
are spitting images of one another?

1787
01:22:05.829 --> 01:22:07.679
- He got you.
- I thought she might be cold.

1788
01:22:07.704 --> 01:22:10.266
Why do you have so many flowers on?

1789
01:22:10.594 --> 01:22:12.570
- Now, now!
- They aren't flowers, they're mold.

1790
01:22:12.813 --> 01:22:14.352
Your mold is very colorful.

1791
01:22:14.377 --> 01:22:17.457
You look like Joey Wong from A Chinese
Ghost Story that hasn't washed herself.

1792
01:22:17.462 --> 01:22:18.617
You do look like Joey Wong.

1793
01:22:18.641 --> 01:22:22.637
Everyone should calm down. I'll tell
you the last clue my dad left me.

1794
01:22:22.868 --> 01:22:25.742
He told me, my brother and
I enjoyed doing this.

1795
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.524
Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1796
01:22:29.735 --> 01:22:31.038
- I remember!
- I remember!

1797
01:22:31.063 --> 01:22:32.883
We played this game before.

1798
01:22:33.016 --> 01:22:35.164
Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1799
01:22:35.501 --> 01:22:37.797
I thought those were molds!

1800
01:22:38.813 --> 01:22:43.641
I'm sure you're my real brother if you
remember playing this game with me.

1801
01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:44.930
Okay.

1802
01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:46.692
Should we start?

1803
01:22:47.352 --> 01:22:50.563
(A quest to find her brother: Lee
Ha-nui flower has bloomed game)

1804
01:22:50.816 --> 01:22:55.406
(The winner will put on pants and
a jacket and get to Ha-nui first)

1805
01:22:55.851 --> 01:22:57.969
(I'm ready)

1806
01:22:58.797 --> 01:23:01.125
- Let's get it.
- I'm ready, my sister!

1807
01:23:02.274 --> 01:23:04.629
(Who will be Ha-nui's real brother?)

1808
01:23:05.274 --> 01:23:06.274
I'll start.

1809
01:23:06.782 --> 01:23:09.008
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1810
01:23:09.391 --> 01:23:11.617
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1811
01:23:12.828 --> 01:23:15.121
You wilted as soon as you bloomed.

1812
01:23:15.399 --> 01:23:17.695
- Good, god.
- We're allowed to talk, aren't we?

1813
01:23:17.922 --> 01:23:20.195
Of course, you can keep talking.

1814
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:23.836
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1815
01:23:24.383 --> 01:23:25.664
(They turn to ice again)

1816
01:23:25.837 --> 01:23:28.617
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1817
01:23:30.735 --> 01:23:31.942
(Statue-mode)

1818
01:23:32.614 --> 01:23:34.762
Sang-min, you keep on moving.

1819
01:23:35.157 --> 01:23:36.567
I see everyone.

1820
01:23:38.297 --> 01:23:40.559
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1821
01:23:40.852 --> 01:23:43.172
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1822
01:23:44.805 --> 01:23:47.266
I think you guys are moving. Jang-hoon?

1823
01:23:48.852 --> 01:23:50.891
I thought I saw Jang-hoon move a bit.

1824
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:53.848
- I can't see that side well.
- Min Kyung-hoon, you're a jerk.

1825
01:23:54.274 --> 01:23:57.324
- My toes are getting cramped.
- You're moving!

1826
01:23:57.860 --> 01:23:59.727
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1827
01:24:01.804 --> 01:24:03.848
(Kyung-hoon and Hee-chul are in danger)

1828
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:06.672
Kyung-hoon's neck keeps on moving.

1829
01:24:08.087 --> 01:24:11.484
Do you think you'll be okay, Sang-min?
Alright, let's see.

1830
01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:16.113
(He falls down)

1831
01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:17.879
(Sang-min is out)

1832
01:24:19.079 --> 01:24:20.445
You're out, you're out.

1833
01:24:21.833 --> 01:24:23.535
(The game starts again)

1834
01:24:23.915 --> 01:24:28.633
Lee Ha-nui flower is about to bloom
or has it already bloomed already?

1835
01:24:29.047 --> 01:24:30.047
My goodness!

1836
01:24:30.454 --> 01:24:34.984
Lee Ha-nui flower is about to bloom
or has it already bloomed already?

1837
01:24:35.641 --> 01:24:36.641
My goodness!

1838
01:24:37.141 --> 01:24:38.719
I'm first. Right?

1839
01:24:39.251 --> 01:24:41.641
- I'm first, aren't I?
- You're hurting me.

1840
01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.242
Did I hear your knuckles cracking?

1841
01:24:44.399 --> 01:24:47.274
I'm in first place, right? I'm first!
I came in first!

1842
01:24:47.407 --> 01:24:48.407
Hold on.

1843
01:24:48.735 --> 01:24:51.793
- The clothes are too big.
- You guys are good.

1844
01:24:52.567 --> 01:24:55.336
- The pants are too big for me.
- You're really fast.

1845
01:24:55.805 --> 01:24:58.680
- Are you guys ready? - Yeah!
- Okay, okay.

1846
01:24:59.305 --> 01:25:00.836
- I'm starting.
- Okay.

1847
01:25:01.602 --> 01:25:02.602
Geez!

1848
01:25:03.391 --> 01:25:05.133
- Who was it?
- Lee Soo-geun just farted.

1849
01:25:05.188 --> 01:25:07.438
- Clear your throat.
- Get out of here.

1850
01:25:07.501 --> 01:25:10.031
You should clear your throat
if you fart in the elevator.

1851
01:25:10.055 --> 01:25:12.422
That's what Ha-nui told us to do.

1852
01:25:15.274 --> 01:25:16.625
(Take that)

1853
01:25:18.558 --> 01:25:19.914
She's so funny!

1854
01:25:20.758 --> 01:25:22.476
(Ha-nui plays it off perfectly)

1855
01:25:22.501 --> 01:25:25.320
Wait, Ha-nui. What makes
you think it was me?

1856
01:25:25.602 --> 01:25:27.969
- Is it because they told you?
- You cleared your throat.

1857
01:25:28.110 --> 01:25:31.567
I bet you anything that
Ha-nui's hand is going to rot.

1858
01:25:32.563 --> 01:25:34.043
Be careful, Ha-nui.

1859
01:25:34.672 --> 01:25:37.155
I left enough for you
to play your gayageum.

1860
01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:38.180
I'm starting.

1861
01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.350
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1862
01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:44.461
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1863
01:25:45.532 --> 01:25:48.828
Lee Ha-nui flower was about
to bloom and now it has!

1864
01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.524
Wow, that's good.

1865
01:25:50.549 --> 01:25:53.241
(It's hard to move rashly
with her irregular attacks)

1866
01:25:53.266 --> 01:25:55.859
Why do you look like that, Kyung-hoon?

1867
01:25:56.547 --> 01:25:57.547
Okay.

1868
01:25:57.977 --> 01:25:59.746
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1869
01:26:00.212 --> 01:26:02.445
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1870
01:26:03.219 --> 01:26:05.199
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1871
01:26:06.055 --> 01:26:07.055
(Moving)

1872
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:09.113
(He likes catching the other guys)

1873
01:26:09.493 --> 01:26:11.473
(He automatically poses for his penalty)

1874
01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:13.508
(Trying to make him fall down)

1875
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:16.020
He must've farted.

1876
01:26:17.782 --> 01:26:20.266
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1877
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:22.051
(Shaking)

1878
01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:25.899
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1879
01:26:27.817 --> 01:26:30.332
- Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!
- My goodness.

1880
01:26:31.327 --> 01:26:33.121
Aren't you automatically out?

1881
01:26:33.563 --> 01:26:36.445
Hyeong-cheol kind of moved as well.

1882
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:38.372
Tell him he's out. Just kick him out.

1883
01:26:38.751 --> 01:26:40.168
Okay, I'll do that.

1884
01:26:40.774 --> 01:26:42.899
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1885
01:26:43.141 --> 01:26:44.141
(Surprised)

1886
01:26:44.352 --> 01:26:45.844
Come here, Yeong-cheol.

1887
01:26:46.341 --> 01:26:48.305
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1888
01:26:49.102 --> 01:26:50.554
(Yeong-cheol is out)

1889
01:26:50.579 --> 01:26:53.234
- This is too hard.
- Come here, Yeong-cheol.

1890
01:26:53.258 --> 01:26:56.797
- This isn't going my way.
- We all knew you'd be out soon.

1891
01:26:57.113 --> 01:26:59.301
You knew he'd be out this time?

1892
01:26:59.907 --> 01:27:01.930
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1893
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:05.250
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1894
01:27:07.376 --> 01:27:09.215
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1895
01:27:10.266 --> 01:27:11.266
(Wiggling)

1896
01:27:11.344 --> 01:27:13.238
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1897
01:27:13.696 --> 01:27:15.500
Are they fighting over pants?

1898
01:27:15.922 --> 01:27:17.461
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1899
01:27:17.486 --> 01:27:19.171
(None of them are willing to give up)

1900
01:27:19.196 --> 01:27:21.156
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1901
01:27:22.367 --> 01:27:24.293
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1902
01:27:26.258 --> 01:27:28.297
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1903
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:31.109
They're having fun fighting over pants.

1904
01:27:31.704 --> 01:27:33.938
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1905
01:27:35.223 --> 01:27:36.906
(Tumbling down)

1906
01:27:38.165 --> 01:27:41.508
Wait! Did everyone get out?

1907
01:27:41.626 --> 01:27:42.626
Him, him, him!

1908
01:27:42.954 --> 01:27:44.438
- He's still in it.
- Is he?

1909
01:27:44.938 --> 01:27:46.367
Excuse me.

1910
01:27:46.899 --> 01:27:48.743
(I'm still in the game)

1911
01:27:50.289 --> 01:27:53.477
(Three people were still in
it after Yeong-cheol got out)

1912
01:27:53.985 --> 01:27:56.102
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1913
01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:57.863
(She's so excited)

1914
01:27:58.633 --> 01:28:00.008
(Ha-nui's perspective)

1915
01:28:00.235 --> 01:28:02.203
(Excuse me, wait a second)

1916
01:28:03.079 --> 01:28:04.079
(What about me?)

1917
01:28:04.104 --> 01:28:05.957
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1918
01:28:06.766 --> 01:28:08.660
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1919
01:28:08.685 --> 01:28:10.723
(What does she want me to do?)

1920
01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:14.227
(Keeps putting on his clothes)

1921
01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:18.981
(This horrible world only pays
attention to tall people)

1922
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.210
Why didn't you pay attention to Soo-geun?

1923
01:28:21.235 --> 01:28:23.570
- I didn't even see you.
- You should see your brother.

1924
01:28:23.829 --> 01:28:26.656
You and Jang-hoon can be in the finals.

1925
01:28:26.821 --> 01:28:30.578
I don't know if I won. She wouldn't
even look at me while I was moving.

1926
01:28:31.001 --> 01:28:33.195
Didn't you see Soo-geun?

1927
01:28:33.555 --> 01:28:35.086
Wow, this is amazing.

1928
01:28:35.219 --> 01:28:38.320
- She only looked at us.
- I know. She only saw you guys.

1929
01:28:38.345 --> 01:28:40.395
- I know.
- Wow, this is amazing.

1930
01:28:40.672 --> 01:28:42.656
You two can be in the finals.

1931
01:28:43.001 --> 01:28:45.664
That was really funny.

1932
01:28:46.102 --> 01:28:48.031
- This is the finals, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1933
01:28:49.454 --> 01:28:53.055
(Yipee-Dee-doo-dah! I'm spinning!)

1934
01:28:55.277 --> 01:28:57.797
(Just a bundle of joy)

1935
01:28:59.193 --> 01:29:01.195
Are you really my brother?

1936
01:29:01.243 --> 01:29:03.250
He really has gone crazy.

1937
01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:05.391
- I'm starting.
- Okay.

1938
01:29:05.508 --> 01:29:06.719
- This is it.
- Okay.

1939
01:29:07.088 --> 01:29:08.688
(Totally focused)

1940
01:29:09.735 --> 01:29:11.781
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1941
01:29:12.852 --> 01:29:14.731
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1942
01:29:15.415 --> 01:29:16.415
That doesn't  matter.

1943
01:29:16.766 --> 01:29:18.953
- Wow, he's using his head.
- I know.

1944
01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:21.938
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1945
01:29:22.438 --> 01:29:24.524
You need to wear your
clothes before you start.

1946
01:29:24.555 --> 01:29:26.867
- You need to wear it first, giant!
- What?

1947
01:29:27.172 --> 01:29:30.063
- He threw his clothes over there.
- Clothes don't matter.

1948
01:29:30.352 --> 01:29:32.319
He lost already. He was
supposed to wear it too.

1949
01:29:32.344 --> 01:29:36.766
Why are you guys fighting over this?
Can't you enjoy playing this game?

1950
01:29:37.016 --> 01:29:39.953
Isn't Lee Ha-nui flower has
bloomed supposed to be fun?

1951
01:29:40.352 --> 01:29:45.164
- Why are you being so competitive?
- That's right, it's all for fun.

1952
01:29:45.907 --> 01:29:46.907
I'm starting.

1953
01:29:48.141 --> 01:29:49.992
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1954
01:29:50.391 --> 01:29:51.874
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1955
01:29:52.108 --> 01:29:53.108
(Satisfied?)

1956
01:29:53.133 --> 01:29:56.367
Why are you explaining things to us?
It's just a game!

1957
01:29:56.696 --> 01:29:57.938
(Just keep going)

1958
01:29:58.126 --> 01:30:01.859
He probably thinks this is
kind of ambiguous as well.

1959
01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:04.570
- Don't ask us, ask Ha-nui.
- Okay, okay.

1960
01:30:04.688 --> 01:30:07.102
It's still okay. At least until now.

1961
01:30:07.462 --> 01:30:09.539
Try not to move at all.

1962
01:30:09.829 --> 01:30:13.120
Has Lee Ha-nui flower bloomed or not.
It bloomed!

1963
01:30:16.133 --> 01:30:18.246
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1964
01:30:18.922 --> 01:30:22.961
Has Lee Ha-nui flower bloomed or not.
It bloomed!

1965
01:30:25.944 --> 01:30:27.366
(The two are keeping each other in check)

1966
01:30:27.391 --> 01:30:29.586
Can you stop stepping on my clothes?

1967
01:30:29.899 --> 01:30:32.859
We're trying to be happy, why
are you guys so serious?

1968
01:30:32.954 --> 01:30:35.078
Can't you guys enjoy yourselves?

1969
01:30:35.547 --> 01:30:38.984
- This isn't a real tournament.
- No, this is fun and thrilling.

1970
01:30:39.172 --> 01:30:42.891
Has Lee Ha-nui flower bloomed or not.
It bloomed!

1971
01:30:44.762 --> 01:30:46.537
(A big accident)

1972
01:30:47.199 --> 01:30:49.414
Did we need to take the game so seriously?

1973
01:30:50.063 --> 01:30:51.836
Is my underwear showing?

1974
01:30:52.118 --> 01:30:54.734
I can't believe you're still not moving.

1975
01:30:54.837 --> 01:30:57.551
- Is my underwear showing?
- No, it's okay.

1976
01:30:57.719 --> 01:31:01.086
It's okay since we've already
seen everyone else's underwear.

1977
01:31:01.258 --> 01:31:03.484
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed!

1978
01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.679
(One viewer laughs his head off)

1979
01:31:05.704 --> 01:31:08.859
Has Lee Ha-nui flower bloomed or not.
It bloomed!

1980
01:31:09.751 --> 01:31:11.805
(The two aren't giving up an inch)

1981
01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:16.051
Has Lee Ha-nui flower bloomed or not.
It bloomed!

1982
01:31:17.258 --> 01:31:18.797
They're neck and neck.

1983
01:31:18.883 --> 01:31:19.883
It looks like street art.

1984
01:31:20.079 --> 01:31:22.570
They look like some sort of hip-hop team.

1985
01:31:23.473 --> 01:31:26.359
- They look like they're in a hip-hop club.
- That's right.

1986
01:31:26.993 --> 01:31:28.734
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1987
01:31:29.141 --> 01:31:30.586
(Flapping around)

1988
01:31:32.805 --> 01:31:35.703
- He's flying.
- Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1989
01:31:37.059 --> 01:31:38.327
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1990
01:31:38.352 --> 01:31:40.085
(Both of them only have pants left)

1991
01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:42.149
Lee Ha-nui flower has bloomed.

1992
01:31:43.258 --> 01:31:44.999
(He gets one foot in)

1993
01:31:45.024 --> 01:31:47.777
Has Lee Ha-nui flower bloomed or not.
It bloomed!

1994
01:31:48.993 --> 01:31:51.688
Has Lee Ha-nui flower bloomed or not.
It bloomed!

1995
01:31:52.148 --> 01:31:53.984
(He gets the other foot in)

1996
01:31:54.015 --> 01:31:55.015
Damn it!

1997
01:31:57.054 --> 01:31:58.984
(The giant falls)

1998
01:31:59.538 --> 01:32:00.538
(Jang-hoon loses)

1999
01:32:00.743 --> 01:32:04.063
- You tried everything to win.
- Why did you try so hard?

2000
01:32:04.391 --> 01:32:05.930
Why did you fall down?

2001
01:32:06.198 --> 01:32:08.149
(He loses from trying to be too greedy)

2002
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:11.992
- The pant legs got to him.
- I can't believe how serious he was.

2003
01:32:12.383 --> 01:32:14.195
Did you see how hard he was trying?

2004
01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:18.391
- Didn't he cause this to happen?
- He was so annoyed when he fell.

2005
01:32:20.032 --> 01:32:21.032
(Damn it!)

2006
01:32:22.126 --> 01:32:24.660
I can't believe how hard you tried.

2007
01:32:26.485 --> 01:32:27.676
Geez, seriously!

2008
01:32:27.930 --> 01:32:29.382
Good job, good job.

2009
01:32:29.407 --> 01:32:32.984
I thought I had won once I put
my left food through my pants.

2010
01:32:33.009 --> 01:32:36.844
I forced my foot in too
fast and I lost my balance.

2011
01:32:37.633 --> 01:32:39.074
When you were falling...

2012
01:32:39.446 --> 01:32:40.780
Your expression looked like this.

2013
01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:43.796
- Did you see how annoyed he was
when he was falling? - Yeah, I did.

2014
01:32:43.821 --> 01:32:47.703
- Because things didn't go his way.
- Jang-hoon really wanted to win.

2015
01:32:48.672 --> 01:32:51.242
Does this mean Soo-geun
is your real brother?

2016
01:32:51.524 --> 01:32:55.430
I really think I know who
my real brother is now.

2017
01:32:55.797 --> 01:32:59.164
If all of you open your
arms and yell, "Ha-nui"...

2018
01:32:59.547 --> 01:33:02.578
I'll go to my real brother
and give him a hug.

2019
01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:04.520
Can you give me some Fabreeze?

2020
01:33:04.545 --> 01:33:07.215
- Why?
- I'm afraid she won't come near me.

2021
01:33:08.719 --> 01:33:09.719
(Sniffing)

2022
01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:13.539
- Did Seo Jang-hoon win?
- Let's all open our arms.

2023
01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:17.984
- Push the guys you think aren't
your brother. - Okay, let's go.

2024
01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:19.626
I'm going.

2025
01:33:21.016 --> 01:33:25.344
- The person I know isn't my brother is...
- She's over on our side.

2026
01:33:26.337 --> 01:33:29.180
- She's coming this way.
- This feels really odd.

2027
01:33:29.567 --> 01:33:31.219
This feels really strange.

2028
01:33:32.313 --> 01:33:36.102
- Are you okay, Hee-chul?
- Bye, Hee-chul!

2029
01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.069
Why don't you think it's me?

2030
01:33:38.094 --> 01:33:40.141
You're my friend.

2031
01:33:40.477 --> 01:33:42.820
- You can't be my brother.
- That's true.

2032
01:33:42.985 --> 01:33:45.883
- I'm starting.
- It's better to get kicked off early.

2033
01:33:46.751 --> 01:33:48.195
(They close their eyes)

2034
01:33:48.813 --> 01:33:51.906
- My real brother is... - Kyung-hoon
is acting so serious by himself.

2035
01:33:52.165 --> 01:33:54.914
Wait! Everyone needs to close their
eyes and not look at each other.

2036
01:33:55.055 --> 01:33:57.141
Why did he suddenly close his eyes?

2037
01:33:57.844 --> 01:33:59.780
- Weren't we supposed to close our eyes?
- Close your eyes.

2038
01:33:59.805 --> 01:34:02.109
- Close your eyes.
- I'm starting.

2039
01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:06.352
She's kicking someone else out.

2040
01:34:06.610 --> 01:34:07.741
(Kyung-hoon is out)

2041
01:34:07.766 --> 01:34:09.719
- Why isn't it me?
- I'm still alive.

2042
01:34:09.782 --> 01:34:12.649
- You're younger than me.
- That's right, he is.

2043
01:34:12.751 --> 01:34:16.043
- Come here, Kyung-hoon. It's okay.
- I'm still in it.

2044
01:34:16.992 --> 01:34:20.117
(The next person to get
kicked out is Yeong-cheol)

2045
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:24.203
- Why not me?
- Just because.

2046
01:34:25.922 --> 01:34:29.156
- I thought so too. I knew this
would happen. - Last four.

2047
01:34:29.313 --> 01:34:31.133
(Unpredictably, only four are left)

2048
01:34:31.251 --> 01:34:33.046
Let's try playing fair this time.

2049
01:34:33.071 --> 01:34:35.352
You guys didn't know you'd
last this long, did you?

2050
01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:38.796
- Final four, final four!
- I went to the final last time as well.

2051
01:34:38.821 --> 01:34:39.821
Final four!

2052
01:34:40.266 --> 01:34:41.922
- Let's go.
- I'm starting.

2053
01:34:42.587 --> 01:34:44.703
My real brother is one of you guys.

2054
01:34:45.094 --> 01:34:47.242
Push him out with a round-house kick.

2055
01:34:47.305 --> 01:34:48.305
(Okay, I got it)

2056
01:34:48.876 --> 01:34:49.876
(Kicks)

2057
01:34:50.657 --> 01:34:52.078
(Round-house low kick)

2058
01:34:52.165 --> 01:34:53.165
Do it again.

2059
01:34:54.118 --> 01:34:57.047
- He's not budging.
- Did something happen?

2060
01:34:57.735 --> 01:35:00.024
No, no. Nothing happened at all.

2061
01:35:00.049 --> 01:35:01.840
You can't pretend like nothing happened!

2062
01:35:01.985 --> 01:35:06.414
Nothing happened. Close your eyes,
close your eyes, close your eyes.

2063
01:35:07.313 --> 01:35:10.238
- One of you is my brother.
- I can keep this up.

2064
01:35:10.263 --> 01:35:12.078
(Full-swing on the second-time)

2065
01:35:12.227 --> 01:35:14.234
(Something is making him itchy)

2066
01:35:14.641 --> 01:35:16.757
How come Ho-dong isn't your brother?

2067
01:35:16.782 --> 01:35:18.109
Three people left.

2068
01:35:18.329 --> 01:35:20.438
You're no better than a beggar.

2069
01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:25.358
- I don't look like a pig.
- That's right, he can't be her brother.

2070
01:35:25.383 --> 01:35:29.516
- Just as I thought, you look more
like a dog. - My dad told me...

2071
01:35:29.969 --> 01:35:34.418
"You didn't grow very tall because you
were busy taking care of your sister".

2072
01:35:34.782 --> 01:35:36.348
I'll decide now.

2073
01:35:36.837 --> 01:35:39.008
- It's time for a decision.
- This is good.

2074
01:35:39.579 --> 01:35:44.238
- Come on. - Is it really Jang-hoon,
who tried everything to win?

2075
01:35:44.426 --> 01:35:45.426
That's right.

2076
01:35:46.446 --> 01:35:49.867
Is it that person, who is
sweet but has a lot of debt?

2077
01:35:50.868 --> 01:35:54.500
Or, could it be this person, who
smells but tried his very best?

2078
01:35:54.712 --> 01:35:57.805
- I'll decide now.
- Dad told me to give this to my sister.

2079
01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:59.871
My real brother is...

2080
01:36:00.610 --> 01:36:03.164
Dad told me to give this to my sister.

2081
01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:05.891
My real brother is...

2082
01:36:06.258 --> 01:36:07.820
(Who will it be?)

2083
01:36:09.547 --> 01:36:10.547
This person.

2084
01:36:11.281 --> 01:36:12.766
- Why?
- Are you sure?

2085
01:36:13.547 --> 01:36:14.547
(Confused)

2086
01:36:14.837 --> 01:36:18.414
- What's with the turn of events?
- Is this a dream or what?

2087
01:36:19.274 --> 01:36:21.219
Your debts can be cleared now.

2088
01:36:21.399 --> 01:36:24.367
- Your debts can be cleared.
- I can't believe he won.

2089
01:36:24.392 --> 01:36:25.984
He didn't do anything!

2090
01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:30.086
- Where have been all this time?
- I've never seen a decision like this.

2091
01:36:30.313 --> 01:36:33.172
How did he get chosen when he didn't
come in first place for anything?

2092
01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:35.672
You could clear all your debt today.

2093
01:36:35.797 --> 01:36:37.929
- I didn't recognize my sister.
- I'm so happy to see you again.

2094
01:36:37.954 --> 01:36:39.774
I also have really good news.

2095
01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:43.953
Now that I've found you, I'll
split dad's inheritance with you.

2096
01:36:43.993 --> 01:36:46.563
Don't be surprised by dad's inheritance.

2097
01:36:46.821 --> 01:36:48.421
Dad's inheritance is 10 million dollars.

2098
01:36:48.462 --> 01:36:49.934
10 million dollars?

2099
01:36:50.313 --> 01:36:54.375
- He left us a debt of 10 million dollars!
- Why you damned #%^&*!

2100
01:36:54.915 --> 01:36:57.207
- He left you debt?
- His debt was 10 million.

2101
01:36:57.278 --> 01:37:00.334
If we split it, you'll only
owe 5 million dollars!

2102
01:37:00.359 --> 01:37:02.680
At least he has some experience.

2103
01:37:02.712 --> 01:37:06.492
- That's right, you have experience.
- I think Sang-min is really crying.

2104
01:37:06.782 --> 01:37:08.664
It's better than for him to pay the debt...

2105
01:37:09.008 --> 01:37:11.578
since he's already had
experience paying down his debt.

2106
01:37:11.603 --> 01:37:13.046
He's more experienced than anyone else.

2107
01:37:13.071 --> 01:37:14.594
Keep going until 2020.

2108
01:37:14.797 --> 01:37:18.320
- I need to confirm this through
paternity testing. - Sang-min!

2109
01:37:18.539 --> 01:37:20.640
- You're my brother.
- Really? - Yes, you are.

2110
01:37:20.665 --> 01:37:25.030
I need to find my younger brother as
well, so I can split the debt again.

2111
01:37:25.055 --> 01:37:26.594
I'm busy, I'll see you later.

2112
01:37:26.664 --> 01:37:29.117
- Bye, it was fun.
- Okay, bye! It was fun!

2113
01:37:29.415 --> 01:37:31.938
- Bye, brother!
- Bye, brother!

2114
01:37:32.696 --> 01:37:35.031
- Wow, congratulations.
- Not that way!

2115
01:37:35.297 --> 01:37:36.297
(Screaming)

2116
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:40.211
(An ending with many turn of events)

2117
01:37:40.376 --> 01:37:41.805
Did she fall off the cliff?

2118
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:44.570
We changed the cliff to go
on that side last time.

2119
01:37:45.206 --> 01:37:49.727
He said he was traumatized and couldn't
be on a show with you anymore, Ho-dong.

2120
01:37:50.243 --> 01:37:52.063
- Give me a name. Who?
- Ye-sung.

2121
01:37:52.758 --> 01:37:55.719
(The name has left Ho-dong
trembling with betrayal)

2122
01:37:55.984 --> 01:37:58.242
(Ye-sung, the name he couldn't speak of)

2123
01:37:58.710 --> 01:37:59.710
(He's here)

2124
01:38:00.387 --> 01:38:01.819
(Variety show idols, Super Junior)

2125
01:38:02.032 --> 01:38:04.492
Artistic voice! Ye-sung!

2126
01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:09.567
I try to avoid city named Chun Ho-dong
since I'm scared of the name.

2127
01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:11.772
He hid himself with his
hair because he's scared.

2128
01:38:11.797 --> 01:38:13.863
- You should cut this shorter.
- (Scared)

2129
01:38:13.969 --> 01:38:16.508
- You need to keep smiling. Smile.
- He's a terrorist.

2130
01:38:16.712 --> 01:38:19.574
Ho- dong, I love you.

2131
01:38:21.235 --> 01:38:22.235
Good job!

2132
01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:26.305
I think he's the best variety
show guest and idol.

2133
01:38:26.933 --> 01:38:29.594
(He dances Ho-dong's favorite dance)

2134
01:38:30.247 --> 01:38:31.247
(Swag)

2135
01:38:32.087 --> 01:38:35.281
- What's with the tongue?
- Square. - Something fat.

2136
01:38:35.391 --> 01:38:36.391
Try again.

2137
01:38:36.501 --> 01:38:38.141
(Try to guess this as well)

2138
01:38:38.274 --> 01:38:41.801
- You're missing a screw.
- No, my in-grown toenail is growing again.

2139
01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:44.758
I think I'd rather be a
part of Ask Us Anything.

2140
01:38:45.602 --> 01:38:47.445
His emotional highs and lows are extreme.

2141
01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:52.031
A girl group debuted, and I saw
two girls Hee-chul dated.

2142
01:38:52.212 --> 01:38:53.212
Dizzy)

2143
01:38:53.524 --> 01:38:55.524
No. Leeteuk, himself, is
our group's weak link.

2144
01:38:55.672 --> 01:38:58.631
There was a time when I
hated my group members.

2145
01:38:58.657 --> 01:39:00.031
I really hated them.

2146
01:39:00.321 --> 01:39:04.152
- I hate it when one of our members
does this. - When do you like us?

2147
01:39:04.563 --> 01:39:07.656
Do you think our album will be
promoted by us coming on this show?

2148
