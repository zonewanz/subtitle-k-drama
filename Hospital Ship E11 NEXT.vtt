1
00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:12.283
Doctor. Doctor Kwak.

2
00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:14.717
A post-exit hepatectomy...

3
00:00:14.717 --> 00:00:16.947
is the last hope for the patient.

4
00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:18.287
You refuse to take it?

5
00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:19.857
Is it right to let the patient die...

6
00:00:19.857 --> 00:00:21.427
during a risky operation?

7
00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:22.828
Paternalism isn't fair,

8
00:00:22.828 --> 00:00:24.657
but you have no right to decide.

9
00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:26.727
Only Seol Jae Chan...

10
00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:30.267
can decide whether to get the operation or not.

11
00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:38.538
What do you mean?

12
00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.078
You heard me.

13
00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:42.678
I refuse to be operated.

14
00:00:42.907 --> 00:00:44.447
You're making a rash decision.

15
00:00:44.748 --> 00:00:48.788
The operation doesn't seem safe either.

16
00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:52.118
Did Dr. Kwak influence your decision?

17
00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:55.627
Why do you ask?

18
00:00:55.627 --> 00:00:59.457
If he emphasized only the negative, I'd like to explain otherwise.

19
00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:00.627
No.

20
00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:03.568
He recommended the operation.

21
00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:06.168
He wanted to trust you.

22
00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:07.668
Then why?

23
00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:10.037
I don't want to waste my time.

24
00:01:12.877 --> 00:01:16.507
My wife died of cancer 10 years ago.

25
00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:18.748
It was terminal cancer.

26
00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:22.418
In other words,

27
00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:25.957
I know exactly what will happen to me...

28
00:01:25.957 --> 00:01:27.927
from now on.

29
00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:34.328
Mr. Seol.

30
00:01:35.198 --> 00:01:38.367
Mr. Seol, this isn't right.

31
00:01:39.138 --> 00:01:40.567
Let it go.

32
00:01:41.838 --> 00:01:44.978
We gave up the operation, not the entire treatment.

33
00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.177
Let's go to Seoul now.

34
00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:51.048
I don't want to. My kids are waiting.

35
00:01:54.487 --> 00:01:55.588
Mr. Seol.

36
00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:10.198
The cancer spread all over her body,

37
00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:14.038
and the doctor recommended the operation like you.

38
00:02:15.737 --> 00:02:17.267
Of course.

39
00:02:18.108 --> 00:02:20.277
How can a warrior avoid a fight?

40
00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:24.378
My wife didn't want the operation.

41
00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:29.617
However, I almost forced her to get it.

42
00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:33.457
We did everything the doctors told us to do...

43
00:02:34.117 --> 00:02:36.328
including surgery and chemotherapy.

44
00:02:37.927 --> 00:02:39.698
She didn't want it, but I...

45
00:02:39.698 --> 00:02:41.598
Don't blame yourself.

46
00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:44.128
As a guardian,

47
00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:46.598
you did the right thing.

48
00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:50.068
- For your wife... - No.

49
00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:54.448
It wasn't for my wife.

50
00:02:55.548 --> 00:02:57.307
I did it for myself.

51
00:02:58.647 --> 00:03:00.048
I felt so sorry.

52
00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:04.017
Her stomach was in so much pain,

53
00:03:04.957 --> 00:03:06.288
but all I gave her...

54
00:03:06.288 --> 00:03:10.728
was digestive medicine. I regretted it so much.

55
00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:14.198
I was sorry for what I've done.

56
00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:19.698
I was trying to make up...

57
00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:39.418
I shouldn't have done so.

58
00:03:44.497 --> 00:03:45.497
Do you know...

59
00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:49.098
how my wife was before she died?

60
00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:55.138
She couldn't even swallow rice.

61
00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:02.108
She said she preferred autumn leaves to flowers...

62
00:04:03.478 --> 00:04:04.677
and wanted to,

63
00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:08.017
for one last time, see the fallen leaves.

64
00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:10.858
I didn't even...

65
00:04:11.658 --> 00:04:13.057
grant her that wish.

66
00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:24.637
She stayed in a bed and stayed a patient...

67
00:04:25.697 --> 00:04:27.338
until she finally died.

68
00:04:35.548 --> 00:04:36.577
Hyun.

69
00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:44.918
I don't want to... end up dying like that.

70
00:05:02.108 --> 00:05:03.838
You must feel dejected.

71
00:05:07.677 --> 00:05:09.348
The patient refused surgery.

72
00:05:10.947 --> 00:05:13.418
The shock can cause a lapse in judgement.

73
00:05:14.218 --> 00:05:16.218
As soon as he calms down, I'll...

74
00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:18.588
You'll what? Try to persuade him?

75
00:05:19.757 --> 00:05:21.028
Wake up.

76
00:05:21.028 --> 00:05:23.387
His guardian's looking for other doctors.

77
00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:26.827
The Internal Medicine specialist.

78
00:05:27.197 --> 00:05:30.098
His father's the legendary surgeon, Kwak Sung.

79
00:05:30.427 --> 00:05:31.437
I know that.

80
00:05:31.437 --> 00:05:34.307
Then you must know how connected he is.

81
00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:37.437
He already contacted MD Anderson.

82
00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:40.848
I think they'll recommend us.

83
00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.418
We're more advanced in liver, gall bladder, and pancreatic medicine.

84
00:05:44.418 --> 00:05:46.418
Just get straight to the point.

85
00:05:46.418 --> 00:05:47.887
Mr. Seol...

86
00:05:48.418 --> 00:05:50.048
will choose us.

87
00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:53.057
He hasn't given up on surgery.

88
00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.627
He escaped from a young, untrustworthy female doctor.

89
00:05:56.728 --> 00:05:57.898
You should leave.

90
00:05:59.098 --> 00:06:00.158
Let's make a deal.

91
00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.468
I'll get the patient in our OR.

92
00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:10.007
You can pick any member of the team to scrub in.

93
00:06:10.338 --> 00:06:13.737
If you need other specialists' help, I'll get it for you.

94
00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:15.377
In return,

95
00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:18.247
publish the paper in my name.

96
00:06:20.048 --> 00:06:21.887
You're in no position to refuse.

97
00:06:24.158 --> 00:06:25.257
What do you mean?

98
00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:28.228
Who do you think called me all the way to this place?

99
00:06:31.098 --> 00:06:32.127
Yes.

100
00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:34.997
I called Doctor Kim over.

101
00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:37.327
May I ask why?

102
00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:38.898
I needed verification.

103
00:06:40.268 --> 00:06:43.038
It's my job to train skilled doctors,

104
00:06:43.408 --> 00:06:47.038
but it's also my job to protect patients from irrational ones.

105
00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.747
I thought that Doctor Kim, your teacher and mentor,

106
00:06:51.817 --> 00:06:54.548
would be the perfect man for the job.

107
00:06:55.117 --> 00:06:56.218
Is there a problem?

108
00:07:00.117 --> 00:07:02.427
- And your conclusion? - The operation...

109
00:07:02.658 --> 00:07:06.098
is a reckless one, just as I'd thought.

110
00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:10.268
Are you sure...

111
00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:13.468
you can convince the patient?

112
00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.137
It is a reckless attempt,

113
00:07:18.608 --> 00:07:20.038
but if it were impossible,

114
00:07:21.677 --> 00:07:24.478
Doctor Kim wouldn't have rushed over here right away.

115
00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:33.617
Hello.

116
00:07:36.788 --> 00:07:38.528
You'll open up the procedure?

117
00:07:39.257 --> 00:07:40.757
Is there a reason I can't?

118
00:07:40.757 --> 00:07:44.268
What if she succeeds? Doctor Song will leave immediately.

119
00:07:44.268 --> 00:07:45.997
The patient will live.

120
00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:47.237
If she fails?

121
00:07:48.307 --> 00:07:49.867
Doctor Song will remain.

122
00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:52.708
What do you think are the chances...

123
00:07:53.108 --> 00:07:55.348
of her pulling off the surgery?

124
00:07:57.048 --> 00:07:58.048
I don't know.

125
00:07:58.877 --> 00:08:01.247
Less than 10 percent, and that's being generous.

126
00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:03.117
Then the likelihood of her staying...

127
00:08:06.117 --> 00:08:07.827
is over 90 percent.

128
00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:19.197
Gosh, that's a great drawing.

129
00:08:19.497 --> 00:08:20.567
Were you fake sick?

130
00:08:21.608 --> 00:08:23.237
Why would I fake being sick?

131
00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:25.737
I'm sick in the heart.

132
00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:26.838
- Are you? - Yes.

133
00:08:26.838 --> 00:08:27.848
Sick in the heart?

134
00:08:28.148 --> 00:08:30.247
Then put on some ointment.

135
00:08:32.177 --> 00:08:33.248
I should.

136
00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.457
Don't tell the kids.

137
00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:47.528
You're all great artists.

138
00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:50.197
What's this? That's a beautiful picture of the sea.

139
00:08:50.197 --> 00:08:52.298
Teacher, I'll put some cream on for you.

140
00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:54.567
Do you call this cream?

141
00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.238
I don't want to be a burden.

142
00:08:56.638 --> 00:08:59.177
Not to the kids or the other inhabitants.

143
00:08:59.177 --> 00:09:01.707
- Me too, teacher. - You too.

144
00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:04.008
Don't. Stop it, all of you.

145
00:09:04.008 --> 00:09:06.248
Stop it. Don't paint me.

146
00:09:07.317 --> 00:09:09.918
- I'm next. - I surrender.

147
00:09:09.918 --> 00:09:12.357
Teacher, I'm not done yet.

148
00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:29.707
- Hello? - Where are you?

149
00:09:30.168 --> 00:09:31.238
At the school.

150
00:09:31.378 --> 00:09:32.437
Good.

151
00:09:33.307 --> 00:09:34.307
Why is that good?

152
00:09:34.447 --> 00:09:37.447
You didn't exhaust the patient by taking him to other hospitals.

153
00:09:37.447 --> 00:09:39.248
- But... - But what?

154
00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:42.347
It's illogical to refuse surgery.

155
00:09:42.488 --> 00:09:45.057
It's tough to be entirely logical about this.

156
00:09:45.317 --> 00:09:47.018
It can be so for the patient.

157
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.687
- Doctor Song. - The doctor mustn't be like that.

158
00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:52.057
Stop being Mr. Kwak the guardian,

159
00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:55.467
and be the rational Internalist Doctor Kwak.

160
00:09:55.868 --> 00:09:58.268
What do you think is logical and rational?

161
00:10:00.138 --> 00:10:01.538
See you at the dorm later.

162
00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:10.248
It looks so sweet.

163
00:10:10.248 --> 00:10:13.618
- It's nice and ripe. - It looks amazing.

164
00:10:15.087 --> 00:10:16.087
You're back early.

165
00:10:16.087 --> 00:10:18.217
What happened to the rectal cancer patient?

166
00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:19.658
Will he be operated on? When?

167
00:10:19.658 --> 00:10:21.927
Will you let me watch? I'll scrub in...

168
00:10:21.927 --> 00:10:23.187
What should I answer first?

169
00:10:23.427 --> 00:10:25.028
Have some watermelon first.

170
00:10:25.427 --> 00:10:26.528
Where's Doctor Kwak?

171
00:10:26.528 --> 00:10:27.768
Not back yet. Why?

172
00:10:27.768 --> 00:10:30.998
He will decide whether I'll operate or not.

173
00:10:31.868 --> 00:10:33.697
What do you mean?

174
00:10:33.697 --> 00:10:36.207
Mr. Seol Jae Chan is the patient.

175
00:10:38.607 --> 00:10:41.378
Oh dear. This is terrible.

176
00:10:47.177 --> 00:10:48.418
- What? - Have you heard?

177
00:10:48.587 --> 00:10:50.548
- Heard what? - Mr. Seol has cancer.

178
00:10:50.857 --> 00:10:51.918
Cancer?

179
00:10:52.288 --> 00:10:53.658
(Store)

180
00:10:54.788 --> 00:10:56.227
See you.

181
00:10:56.227 --> 00:10:57.498
- Bye. - Bye.

182
00:10:57.498 --> 00:10:59.057
- Take care. - Thanks.

183
00:10:59.197 --> 00:11:01.067
Gosh. Thank you.

184
00:11:01.398 --> 00:11:02.427
Thank you.

185
00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.138
How much are the royalties?

186
00:11:10.738 --> 00:11:12.437
A lot, I guess. He's a famous poet.

187
00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:15.847
He's childless. Who will it go to?

188
00:11:16.648 --> 00:11:18.118
Are you a psychopath?

189
00:11:18.748 --> 00:11:21.118
How can you talk about royalties when a man might die?

190
00:11:21.488 --> 00:11:24.317
Yes, because I wasn't born rich unlike someone else.

191
00:11:24.618 --> 00:11:25.618
Hey.

192
00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:28.028
Why did you study Korean Medicine?

193
00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:29.988
What do you mean?

194
00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:32.727
If you got in, that means you weren't entirely useless in school.

195
00:11:33.197 --> 00:11:34.697
Why not go to medical school?

196
00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:36.827
You can't inherit your dad's hospital.

197
00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:41.508
There was someone else to inherit it.

198
00:11:43.467 --> 00:11:44.908
When I came first in my class,

199
00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.548
he came first in his year, and I hated him.

200
00:11:48.577 --> 00:11:49.648
Who was that?

201
00:11:51.518 --> 00:11:52.548
An older brother?

202
00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:56.347
Why did you speak in past tense?

203
00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:57.988
Did he quit medicine?

204
00:11:58.957 --> 00:12:00.827
No. He died.

205
00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:03.357
In a car crash...

206
00:12:03.788 --> 00:12:06.528
while driving to the airport to pick me up.

207
00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:10.868
Why do you talk like he's a total stranger?

208
00:12:11.498 --> 00:12:12.538
How else should I say it?

209
00:12:13.038 --> 00:12:14.268
Should I cry as well?

210
00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:16.908
Forget it.

211
00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:19.077
This is no fun. Let's go.

212
00:12:22.077 --> 00:12:23.248
The royalties.

213
00:12:24.107 --> 00:12:26.077
Since he has no children...

214
00:12:26.077 --> 00:12:28.148
Will you stop it?

215
00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:33.788
Why does she look disappointed?

216
00:12:35.758 --> 00:12:37.927
You look so forlorn.

217
00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:40.498
One would think you're waiting for your lover.

218
00:12:40.758 --> 00:12:42.868
- Do you like being silly? - Yes.

219
00:12:47.197 --> 00:12:48.408
(Doctor Song)

220
00:12:59.118 --> 00:13:00.148
Mr. Seol.

221
00:13:00.317 --> 00:13:01.418
Are you done?

222
00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:04.048
Almost. There's not much left.

223
00:13:04.187 --> 00:13:05.187
Let's eat.

224
00:13:06.957 --> 00:13:09.227
Okay, just a moment.

225
00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:10.427
There.

226
00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:12.158
I'm done.

227
00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.437
- Here. - It smells great.

228
00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:27.648
It might only smell good.

229
00:13:32.648 --> 00:13:35.048
The taste is even more incredible.

230
00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:38.057
- It is? - Of course. Let's eat.

231
00:13:42.587 --> 00:13:44.528
Eat up.

232
00:13:44.528 --> 00:13:46.227
Eat, and take the last boat out.

233
00:13:46.557 --> 00:13:48.028
I'm sleeping over.

234
00:13:51.738 --> 00:13:53.168
Am I going to die tonight?

235
00:13:53.998 --> 00:13:55.807
How could you say that?

236
00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:58.677
Then why are you treating me like I'm dead already?

237
00:14:00.408 --> 00:14:02.878
I have a pile of work to do.

238
00:14:02.878 --> 00:14:04.317
You'll distract me,

239
00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:07.118
and I'll be inefficient if you're around.

240
00:14:08.118 --> 00:14:11.087
Just one night. Let me sleep over just one night.

241
00:14:11.288 --> 00:14:13.057
What about the hospital ship?

242
00:14:13.057 --> 00:14:14.457
Take me on the school boat.

243
00:14:14.457 --> 00:14:16.128
It's not far.

244
00:14:17.128 --> 00:14:20.057
- Just for one night then. - Okay.

245
00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:10.107
You can't sleep?

246
00:15:11.518 --> 00:15:12.577
No.

247
00:15:13.518 --> 00:15:15.118
It happens when you're old.

248
00:15:17.788 --> 00:15:19.018
Are you afraid?

249
00:15:24.827 --> 00:15:27.697
It's my first time dying, so...

250
00:15:30.837 --> 00:15:32.597
We can fight it.

251
00:15:34.707 --> 00:15:37.778
You can go back to the hospital and get surgery,

252
00:15:38.077 --> 00:15:40.008
or we can look for other doctors.

253
00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:44.217
But one thing for sure is,

254
00:15:45.118 --> 00:15:47.317
whatever you decide,

255
00:15:48.648 --> 00:15:49.947
I'll be with you.

256
00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.217
I'll stay with you all the way.

257
00:16:20.378 --> 00:16:21.687
Where are you coming from?

258
00:16:22.187 --> 00:16:25.687
Were you with the patient last night?

259
00:16:26.388 --> 00:16:28.227
Why weren't you answering your phone?

260
00:16:29.758 --> 00:16:30.998
What does that mean?

261
00:16:30.998 --> 00:16:33.927
You look like a wife nagging her husband for not coming home.

262
00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:36.128
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

263
00:16:36.868 --> 00:16:38.837
Is the patient okay?

264
00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.357
What is this?

265
00:16:59.357 --> 00:17:02.628
My thesis that I'm working on. Although I haven't completed yet...

266
00:17:05.298 --> 00:17:08.698
And these are the results of the animal testing.

267
00:17:09.327 --> 00:17:11.897
In some ways, animal testing is more difficult.

268
00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:13.798
Dogs may seem stronger than humans,

269
00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:15.538
but they are much weaker.

270
00:17:15.538 --> 00:17:18.738
Conclusively, if one succeeds on a dog, a human...

271
00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:20.577
Stop. That's enough.

272
00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:25.377
What does that mean?

273
00:17:26.948 --> 00:17:28.647
Do you think this will convince the patient?

274
00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:31.087
The patient is afraid because it's the first surgery of this type.

275
00:17:31.087 --> 00:17:34.018
- So we must give him assurance. - With animal testing data?

276
00:17:35.758 --> 00:17:37.827
Do you remember the name of the first patient you operated on?

277
00:17:38.097 --> 00:17:39.657
What was your first patient's name?

278
00:17:40.528 --> 00:17:41.827
You don't remember, do you?

279
00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:44.468
You can see the surgery clearly, as if it's a photograph,

280
00:17:44.468 --> 00:17:46.298
but you don't know the patient's name,

281
00:17:46.597 --> 00:17:50.268
appearance, struggles prior to surgery, things like that, do you?

282
00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:51.607
What's wrong with that?

283
00:17:51.607 --> 00:17:53.607
That's why you come up with something like this.

284
00:17:54.178 --> 00:17:56.248
Do you know what persuasion is?

285
00:17:56.248 --> 00:17:58.248
It's making a person feel a certain way,

286
00:17:58.248 --> 00:18:01.087
not holding data and just saying whatever you want.

287
00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:03.248
You need to listen first.

288
00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:06.758
"What does this person want? What does he fear most?"

289
00:18:06.917 --> 00:18:08.288
You have no desire to, do you?

290
00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:11.228
Because to you, a patient is nothing but a tool...

291
00:18:11.228 --> 00:18:13.057
for your success.

292
00:18:13.057 --> 00:18:14.867
Being a doctor is our job.

293
00:18:16.597 --> 00:18:18.968
Fixing patients is our job.

294
00:18:18.968 --> 00:18:21.807
We get paid for that and succeed.

295
00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:23.367
Is that bad?

296
00:18:23.538 --> 00:18:26.077
Fine. Let's just say...

297
00:18:26.607 --> 00:18:28.347
I'm a scumbag obsessed with success,

298
00:18:28.347 --> 00:18:30.877
who cares about my career more than a patient's life.

299
00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:34.317
What is it that you're doing?

300
00:18:34.688 --> 00:18:37.587
You can candy coat it all you want, but bottom line is,

301
00:18:37.587 --> 00:18:39.657
a patient is dying before your very eyes,

302
00:18:40.357 --> 00:18:42.928
but you won't do anything about it.

303
00:18:44.327 --> 00:18:46.827
- And you call yourself a doctor? - Doctor.

304
00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:05.048
- You're not going in there. - And you're not going up.

305
00:19:10.448 --> 00:19:12.587
Cohabitation means...

306
00:19:12.587 --> 00:19:15.657
you need rules. Rules.

307
00:19:15.657 --> 00:19:16.788
Especially you, Dr. Song.

308
00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:18.857
Since you were new and working in the ER,

309
00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:21.097
we have been very patient.

310
00:19:21.097 --> 00:19:24.738
But now, we'd like you to participate like the rest of us.

311
00:19:24.738 --> 00:19:25.938
What do you mean?

312
00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:27.807
(Hospital Ship Dorm Rules)

313
00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:35.147
(Hospital Ship Dorm Rules)

314
00:19:35.147 --> 00:19:36.508
What should I do?

315
00:19:37.278 --> 00:19:38.847
Here.

316
00:19:39.548 --> 00:19:40.948
Come now.

317
00:19:41.788 --> 00:19:43.448
- Ladder game? - Yes, ladder game.

318
00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:45.657
- That's how we always chose. - It's pure luck.

319
00:19:45.657 --> 00:19:46.958
- Okay? - Number one.

320
00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:47.958
- 9. - 2.

321
00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:49.087
- 4. - 6.

322
00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:50.157
- 5. - 8.

323
00:19:50.157 --> 00:19:51.557
- 3. - 7.

324
00:19:55.728 --> 00:19:58.698
- Yes. - Anything but the bathroom.

325
00:20:00.738 --> 00:20:02.307
The bathroom again?

326
00:20:02.307 --> 00:20:04.178
I have to bathe Bong Gu.

327
00:20:04.178 --> 00:20:07.478
Dr. Song has... Shopping?

328
00:20:07.478 --> 00:20:09.778
How lucky.

329
00:20:10.577 --> 00:20:12.248
You got shopping too?

330
00:20:17.147 --> 00:20:18.988
- Switch with me. - What is he saying?

331
00:20:18.988 --> 00:20:20.788
Okay. Get going. No fighting.

332
00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:24.028
Here, Dr. Kwak. Here's the list.

333
00:20:24.327 --> 00:20:26.498
It's been decided.

334
00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:34.167
Shopping list.

00:21:34.567 --> 00:21:36.228
and got everything in 10 minutes?

338
00:21:36.397 --> 00:21:38.637
It's nothing compared to memorizing the book on blood vessels.

339
00:21:40.538 --> 00:21:41.807
What's next?

340
00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.807
Try this too.

341
00:21:44.807 --> 00:21:47.678
I'll take this. Let me try it.

342
00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:52.647
Isn't it good?

343
00:21:52.748 --> 00:21:55.048
- Yes, this is good. - 20 dollars.

344
00:21:55.248 --> 00:21:58.387
Give me a discount. I'm going to buy a lot.

345
00:21:58.387 --> 00:21:59.688
What else are you getting?

346
00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:05.057
- What fish is good for a stew? - They're all good today.

347
00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:07.097
Rockfish, fish intestine, and spicy salted squid.

348
00:22:07.357 --> 00:22:09.167
The clams taste better.

349
00:22:09.298 --> 00:22:11.798
Life doesn't always go as planned.

350
00:22:14.238 --> 00:22:15.268
Okay.

351
00:22:17.307 --> 00:22:18.807
Don't you see this list?

352
00:22:19.107 --> 00:22:21.807
Come now. Your husband is completely right.

353
00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:24.278
- Wifey. - I'm not a wifey.

354
00:22:24.278 --> 00:22:26.377
Come to the car in five minutes, or I'm leaving.

355
00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:27.817
Do you have the car keys?

356
00:22:33.258 --> 00:22:34.357
Why that...

357
00:22:35.857 --> 00:22:38.798
She clearly is your wifey. Did you get into a fight?

358
00:22:39.097 --> 00:22:40.698
She's just acting, right?

359
00:22:41.798 --> 00:22:44.067
I'll take this and a lot of that.

360
00:22:44.567 --> 00:22:47.708
Goodness. It's so hard to make a living.

361
00:22:47.708 --> 00:22:49.538
- I'll give you a lot. - Thank you.

362
00:22:52.377 --> 00:22:53.438
Hello...

363
00:22:56.647 --> 00:22:58.317
You didn't take the food!

364
00:23:02.248 --> 00:23:03.587
What's wrong?

365
00:23:05.188 --> 00:23:06.317
Dr. Kwak.

366
00:23:07.317 --> 00:23:10.387
- What is it? - The patient went missing.

367
00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:20.397
Who's there?

368
00:23:20.397 --> 00:23:22.407
Sir.

369
00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:26.137
Open the door. Sir. Sir.

370
00:23:50.127 --> 00:23:53.097
What's serious is that a huge quantity of pain killers...

371
00:23:53.097 --> 00:23:54.807
also disappeared.

372
00:23:55.708 --> 00:23:56.968
Morphine?

373
00:23:57.637 --> 00:23:59.178
Why do you need morphine?

374
00:24:02.048 --> 00:24:03.508
Don't you know why?

375
00:24:04.377 --> 00:24:05.778
Do you want to die?

376
00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:07.788
Do you want me to kill you?

377
00:24:07.788 --> 00:24:10.347
- I'm already dead. - Father.

378
00:24:14.557 --> 00:24:15.688
Do you think...

379
00:24:17.127 --> 00:24:19.127
I'm living?

380
00:24:21.367 --> 00:24:23.397
Do you think that I'm alive?

381
00:24:42.887 --> 00:24:44.587
I'm sorry. Can you drive?

382
00:24:51.228 --> 00:24:53.157
(Jaae Rehabilitation Center)

383
00:24:55.298 --> 00:24:58.438
- Mr. Kwak. - Mr. Kwak.

384
00:24:58.698 --> 00:25:00.367
- Father. - Mr. Kwak.

385
00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:02.667
- Father. - Mr. Kwak.

386
00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:05.238
- Mr. Kwak. - Mr. Kwak.

387
00:25:05.238 --> 00:25:07.478
- Father. - Where are you?

388
00:25:07.478 --> 00:25:09.807
- Mr. Kwak. - Where are you?

389
00:25:09.807 --> 00:25:13.117
- Mr. Kwak. - Where are you, Mr. Kwak?

390
00:25:13.117 --> 00:25:14.518
Mr. Kwak.

391
00:25:15.288 --> 00:25:17.617
- Mr. Kwak. - Father.

392
00:25:47.218 --> 00:25:49.317
- Mr. Kwak. - Wait.

393
00:25:52.057 --> 00:25:53.157
Wait.

394
00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:55.857
Someone may get hurt if we make a move too quickly.

395
00:25:56.028 --> 00:25:58.028
The patient might harm himself.

396
00:25:59.397 --> 00:26:00.867
Calm down.

397
00:26:02.268 --> 00:26:03.867
We aren't your enemy.

398
00:26:07.438 --> 00:26:08.637
It's okay.

399
00:26:10.067 --> 00:26:11.238
It's all right.

400
00:26:13.178 --> 00:26:14.607
We aren't your enemy.

401
00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:30.357
Who are you?

402
00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:32.327
I'm a doctor.

403
00:26:34.428 --> 00:26:36.327
I'm also a doctor, sir.

404
00:26:39.367 --> 00:26:41.538
I'll finish treating the patient.

405
00:26:41.907 --> 00:26:43.008
So please...

406
00:26:44.208 --> 00:26:46.807
get some rest.

407
00:26:46.807 --> 00:26:48.407
You should also get treated.

408
00:26:50.347 --> 00:26:54.488
Shall I?

409
00:26:56.347 --> 00:26:58.057
Thanks to you,

410
00:26:59.788 --> 00:27:01.428
I feel much better.

411
00:27:11.738 --> 00:27:15.268
The nurses will take you to a place to stay.

412
00:27:24.948 --> 00:27:26.147
By the way,

413
00:27:28.948 --> 00:27:32.357
what is your name, doctor?

414
00:27:34.528 --> 00:27:35.627
Hyun.

415
00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:39.127
It's Kwak Hyun, doctor.

416
00:27:40.228 --> 00:27:42.327
"Kwak Hyun"?

417
00:27:54.377 --> 00:27:58.077
Your last name is the same as mine.

418
00:28:00.147 --> 00:28:02.218
Please take care of the patient.

419
00:28:03.117 --> 00:28:04.587
Doctor Kwak.

420
00:28:06.157 --> 00:28:07.627
Here.

421
00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:14.057
This is a painkiller.

422
00:28:14.327 --> 00:28:15.998
There was an attack.

423
00:28:16.468 --> 00:28:20.198
They'll need a lot of it tonight.

424
00:29:41.856 --> 00:29:44.556
(Episode 12 will air shortly.)
