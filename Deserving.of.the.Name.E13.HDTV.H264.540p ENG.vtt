00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:21.675
Why do you want to become a doctor?

2
00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:23.443
Who do you want to heal?

3
00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:26.613
- My mother. - What?

4
00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:28.548
I want to heal people like my mother.

5
00:00:35.422 --> 00:00:37.691
Do you want to learn acupuncture?

6
00:00:37.857 --> 00:00:38.858
Yes.

7
00:00:39.192 --> 00:00:43.530
You should always bring new water from the mountain in the morning...

8
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.333
to sharpen the needles.

9
00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:52.505
You should keep your position straight.

10
00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:55.475
It is important to sharpen the needles like that.

11
00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:00.046
Keep your position straight.

12
00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:02.749
- You. - Oh, my.

13
00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:04.150
Keep your position straight.

14
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:07.587
I told you that keeping your position straight is important.

15
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.057
This is fit to stick it in radishes.

16
00:01:12.392 --> 00:01:15.362
You have the wrong attitude.

17
00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:16.463
That is why you cannot do it.

18
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.398
Polish your mind...

19
00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:20.567
while you sharpen the needles.

20
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:28.007
The art of medicine handles people's lives.

21
00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:32.579
That means a doctor should become one with his needles.

22
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.949
The needles will know...

23
00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:38.618
if you have bad notions.

24
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.307
There.

25
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.111
Do not forget.

26
00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:07.280
The needles and doctor...

27
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.116
should always act straightly from the heart.

28
00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:13.553
Are you happy that you are home?

29
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:17.424
You had a hard time wandering from places.

30
00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:20.760
Let us do our best and establish a foundation here.

31
00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:30.403
Why did you come back?

32
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:33.840
I came to the place where I should be.

33
00:02:34.674 --> 00:02:36.009
Where you should be?

34
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.079
- Is this the place? - Yes, this is the place.

35
00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:43.082
Says who?

36
00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:45.785
Did you not say...

37
00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:48.888
that I should act properly as a doctor regardless where I am?

38
00:02:50.023 --> 00:02:52.325
How will you act properly as a doctor?

39
00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.561
It does not matter whether the patients live in a palace or a hut,

40
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:56.596
or whether they are hungry or not.

41
00:02:56.596 --> 00:02:58.698
A doctor is a person who is happy when he saves people...

42
00:02:58.698 --> 00:03:00.333
and feels good when he heals them.

43
00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:05.438
You told me to solve this assignment by myself.

44
00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:07.707
Allow me to solve it here.

45
00:03:09.242 --> 00:03:10.677
I am asking for your permission.

46
00:03:26.025 --> 00:03:28.328
Why did you come to me?

47
00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.064
What do you want from me?

48
00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:45.645
The patient isn't ready yet, right?

49
00:03:46.346 --> 00:03:47.780
Okay, I'm on my way.

50
00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:49.782
Okay.

51
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.224
He will go back one day.

52
00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:01.094
No, he has to go back.

53
00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:04.764

(Royal physician, Came up with new ways of acupuncture)

56
00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:19.145
Yeon Kyung.

57
00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:24.651
Are you going to work?

58
00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:27.320
Why are you leaving so early?

59
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.456
You should eat breakfast and leave a little later.

60
00:04:30.823 --> 00:04:33.092
I need to go because a patient is waiting.

61
00:04:33.493 --> 00:04:35.428
A patient is waiting for you.

62
00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.165
You need to go if a patient is waiting for you.

63
00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.805
I knew this would happen, so I prepared something for you.

64
00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:47.307
Please wait for a minute.

65
00:05:01.588 --> 00:05:03.056
Why don't we have any rice?

66
00:05:04.257 --> 00:05:07.293
I made some yesterday. Did someone eat it?

67
00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:11.798
Take this, and eat it.

68
00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:14.634
What is this?

69
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:18.237
They are rice balls. It seemed like you liked it last time.

70
00:05:18.504 --> 00:05:20.239
I put my skills to good use.

71
00:05:22.842 --> 00:05:26.112
It seems like you always do not eat breakfast.

72
00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:29.682
Keeping your stomach empty long is bad for your internal organs.

73
00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:32.118
I cannot do it every morning,

74
00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:34.120
but I will often prepare breakfast for you.

75
00:05:35.755 --> 00:05:37.156
Every morning?

76
00:05:39.592 --> 00:05:42.095
I cannot promise every morning.

77
00:05:42.395 --> 00:05:43.730
I will do it once a week.

78
00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:46.633
Once a week?

79
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:50.470
Once every four days.

80
00:05:50.937 --> 00:05:52.171
Once every four days?

81
00:05:52.238 --> 00:05:54.841
Okay, it is no big deal.

82
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:58.244
I will make rice balls for you every morning.

83
00:05:58.244 --> 00:06:00.980
Every morning.

84
00:06:01.614 --> 00:06:05.518
I will make rice balls for you every morning.

85
00:06:10.356 --> 00:06:11.658
It is no big deal.

86
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.499
You can go in now.

87
00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:22.268
Did you not forget anything?

88
00:06:22.568 --> 00:06:25.104
I tried so hard for you from early in the morning.

89
00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:27.607
What did I forget?

90
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:33.513
My heart almost dropped.

91
00:06:33.513 --> 00:06:35.815
People here call it "morning kiss".

92
00:06:36.582 --> 00:06:38.751
That's not how you do it.

93
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:40.319
Then how do you do it?

94
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.022
You need to make me want to go home early.

95
00:06:45.491 --> 00:06:47.326
You need to make me think about it all day long.

96
00:06:49.228 --> 00:06:51.464
But who is Cheol Soo?

97
00:06:51.464 --> 00:06:53.433
Why do you need to know?

98
00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:54.901
- Gosh, you surprised me. - Yeon Kyung.

99
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:56.869
- Are you going to work right now? - Hello.

100
00:06:57.236 --> 00:06:58.871
Hello.

101
00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:02.241
Why do you look so surprised? Are you going to work?

102
00:07:02.442 --> 00:07:04.744
Yes... Yes, I am.

103
00:07:04.977 --> 00:07:06.212
It's a good morning.

104
00:07:06.212 --> 00:07:08.681
It is, but you should say that in Korean.

105
00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:11.284
Yeon Kyung, you said your patient was waiting for you.

106
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.486
Yes, my patient is waiting for me. I need to get going.

107
00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:32.705
Oh, my.

108
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.075
I am sorry.

109
00:07:37.777 --> 00:07:39.445
Why are you looking at me like that?

110
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.350
I did not do anything. I did not.

111
00:07:49.422 --> 00:07:51.090
Let us get to work.

112
00:07:55.228 --> 00:07:56.963
The weather is really nice today.

113
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.135
What are you doing?

114
00:08:04.403 --> 00:08:06.572
We have been thinking about it all night long.

115
00:08:06.572 --> 00:08:09.776
We have... Have you? It's not good for your liver.

116
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:13.980
You left us so coldly.

117
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.481
And then you come back here?

118
00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:19.318
I did not leave for good. I just took a short leave.

119
00:08:19.318 --> 00:08:21.921
I came back and found that the clinic and its yard were so dirty.

120
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:24.490
Why is there so much dust?

121
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.926
I cleaned it like this.

122
00:08:26.926 --> 00:08:29.829
Oh, my. Why is this dust so big? Gosh, look at this.

123
00:08:30.763 --> 00:08:32.265
- Gosh. - What are you doing?

124
00:08:32.665 --> 00:08:35.635
Hey stupid, why are you doing this to me? I feel so hurt.

125
00:08:35.735 --> 00:08:39.105
Oh, my. Did he just say he felt hurt?

126
00:08:39.105 --> 00:08:40.573
Yes, he did. What?

127
00:08:40.807 --> 00:08:43.509
I shouldn't be doing this. He did something wrong to us.

128
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:45.011
I told you he was like this.

129
00:08:45.545 --> 00:08:49.515
But now that I am back, please welcome me back.

130
00:08:49.515 --> 00:08:51.284
Do you think I would have come back empty handed?

131
00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:52.518
Are you not?

132
00:08:53.452 --> 00:08:55.988
- I love you guys. - Me too, but what did you bring?

133
00:08:56.989 --> 00:08:58.324
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

134
00:08:58.324 --> 00:09:01.093
Even Yeon Kyung did not get to sit here yet.

135
00:09:01.093 --> 00:09:02.829
I bought it with my salary.

136
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:06.065
Thank you. This is great.

137
00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:08.668
What's this? Hangover removal?

138
00:09:08.668 --> 00:09:12.004
What is this? Did you drink again last night? But your liver...

139
00:09:12.004 --> 00:09:14.407
Cheol Soo, bottoms up.

140
00:09:14.841 --> 00:09:16.409
Let's drink more.

141
00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:19.212
What did you do? You did not fix her liver,

142
00:09:19.212 --> 00:09:21.380
nor her relationship with you, stupid.

143
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.716
We're so much closer now. You don't even know anything.

144
00:09:23.749 --> 00:09:25.685
But who's Cheol Soo? Who is he?

145
00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:28.087
Do you know who that is? Who is Cheol Soo?

146
00:09:28.721 --> 00:09:30.523
Is that the part-time worker from the convenience store?

147
00:09:30.623 --> 00:09:31.891
Who is he?

148
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:34.260
Nothing seems to have changed here.

149
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.063
Are you asleep already? It's only been five minutes.

150
00:09:37.096 --> 00:09:38.865
Who is Cheol Soo?

151
00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:47.373
That is why I like it here.

152
00:09:52.245 --> 00:09:55.314
He's a 62-year-old patient whose ascending aorta was ruptured.

153
00:09:55.314 --> 00:09:57.183
He had a valve replacement surgery.

154
00:09:57.783 --> 00:09:59.785
There wasn't any problem during the surgery,

155
00:09:59.986 --> 00:10:01.587
and his vitals are normal.

156
00:10:02.722 --> 00:10:05.825
But he hasn't gained consciousness yet.

157
00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:08.160
Did he have seizures or any other problems?

158
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.363
He did not have seizures, and his blood tests are fine.

159
00:10:11.364 --> 00:10:12.765
You should watch over him for 2 to 3 days.

160
00:10:13.332 --> 00:10:14.400
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:20.706 --> 00:10:23.643
You were happy when you thought the surgery had gone well.

162
00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:27.380
Do you realize now why I said it'd be hard for him to recover?

163
00:10:27.413 --> 00:10:30.082
You acted up as if you were the only doctor with conviction,

164
00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:31.784
but look at you now.

165
00:10:33.586 --> 00:10:35.721
To think I was embarrassed because of you...

166
00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:38.891
Gosh.

167
00:10:45.364 --> 00:10:47.166
That was a great surgery.

168
00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:55.141
You can only say that when the patient wakes up.

169
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:57.576
Even if he doesn't, I'd say it was.

170
00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:02.415
Why are you looking at me with such round eyes?

171
00:11:03.849 --> 00:11:05.251
No hugs, right?

172
00:11:17.063 --> 00:11:20.166
So? He went back there?

173
00:11:20.232 --> 00:11:22.835
- Yes, sir. - Gosh, I can't believe him.

174
00:11:29.208 --> 00:11:32.144
I have my trust in you, Director Shin.

175
00:11:32.144 --> 00:11:34.947
Yes, of course. I'll do my best.

176
00:11:42.655 --> 00:11:44.190
Take care.

177
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.629
Director Ma, did you just come here?

178
00:11:50.963 --> 00:11:52.164
Yes.

179
00:11:52.365 --> 00:11:54.900
Why is he here?

180
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.102
Yes, well,

181
00:11:56.836 --> 00:12:00.740
it seems like I've gotten lucky just before...

182
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.875
the appointment of the chief director.

183
00:12:03.242 --> 00:12:05.311
I had such good dreams last night too.

184
00:12:07.313 --> 00:12:11.484
By the way, what did you do at Chairman Min's house?

185
00:12:15.021 --> 00:12:16.155
And...

186
00:12:16.155 --> 00:12:19.592
he told me about creating an oriental medicine themed park.

187
00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:22.194
He wanted me to visit the place.

188
00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:25.931
But I don't know if I'd have the time today.

189
00:12:26.165 --> 00:12:27.700
Take care.

190
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.775
(Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic)

191
00:12:43.015 --> 00:12:45.951
Gosh, hello, Byun Ki.

192
00:12:45.951 --> 00:12:47.053
- Let's sit down. - Grandmother.

193
00:12:47.053 --> 00:12:48.854
- It's Byung Ki, not Byun Ki. - Gosh.

194
00:12:48.854 --> 00:12:50.790
- Yes, Byun Ki. - Gosh.

195
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.391
Hello, grandmother.

196
00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:12.044
Welcome to Haeminseo.

197
00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:14.380
I am an oriental doctor, Heo Bong Tak.

198
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.451
I will make sure to do my best so that you will not regret it.

199
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:20.352
What is he saying?

200
00:13:20.352 --> 00:13:21.954
Who is he?

201
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:27.560
You crazy man. Are you trying to sell things again?

202
00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.061
I am not.

203
00:13:29.495 --> 00:13:30.563
Move over.

204
00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:33.532
Bong Tak!

205
00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:37.203
Mother, you are here!

206
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.172
- Oh, my. - Bong Sik is here too.

207
00:13:40.272 --> 00:13:42.341
- Mother! - Is that Bong Tak?

208
00:13:42.842 --> 00:13:44.009
- Mother. - Oh, my.

209
00:13:44.743 --> 00:13:46.545
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

210
00:13:46.545 --> 00:13:48.080
Oh, my goodness.

211
00:13:49.281 --> 00:13:50.649
Mother.

212
00:13:51.951 --> 00:13:54.620
- Oh, my. - Mother, wait.

213
00:13:55.321 --> 00:13:56.622
- Gosh. - Welcome.

214
00:13:56.856 --> 00:13:58.991
- Oh, my. - Are you feeling better now?

215
00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:01.393
Yes, of course. I am much better.

216
00:14:01.494 --> 00:14:03.863
I'm fully recovered.

217
00:14:04.864 --> 00:14:06.432
- Oh, my. - It hurts.

218
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:11.303
Mother. Mother, it hurts.

219
00:14:13.305 --> 00:14:14.640
Recently,

220
00:14:16.041 --> 00:14:17.810
I met a child who was hurt.

221
00:14:19.111 --> 00:14:20.212
But...

222
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:24.150
I couldn't do anything about it.

223
00:14:25.985 --> 00:14:27.520
When I had nothing in my hand,

224
00:14:30.523 --> 00:14:32.491
I was no longer a doctor.

225
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.461
But then,

226
00:14:36.862 --> 00:14:40.900
I saved a child who was shot just with a scalpel.

227
00:14:44.904 --> 00:14:47.173
Come to think of it, it was a miracle.

228
00:14:48.974 --> 00:14:52.044
But he told me it was not a miracle.

229
00:14:53.012 --> 00:14:56.182
Just like you said, a brother's will to...

230
00:14:56.182 --> 00:14:59.251
save his sister must have saved him.

231
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.622
What is more important...

232
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.825
than the doctors' skill is the patients' will to live.

233
00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:11.263
To strengthen the patients' life force and healing power,

234
00:15:12.131 --> 00:15:15.801
I need to look into the patients' minds first.

235
00:15:18.871 --> 00:15:21.173
Medicine has developed so much.

236
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:25.811
But...

237
00:15:27.112 --> 00:15:28.814
there is nothing more I can do.

238
00:15:33.752 --> 00:15:34.954
So...

239
00:15:36.722 --> 00:15:38.023
that's why I'm going to trust you.

240
00:15:38.791 --> 00:15:39.892
Like he did.

241
00:15:43.162 --> 00:15:44.530
I will trust your will...

242
00:15:46.865 --> 00:15:48.400
and your love for your family.

243
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.650
When I was young,

244
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.354
I was really good at playing janggu.

245
00:16:08.454 --> 00:16:12.024
When I carried my janggu on my shoulder...

246
00:16:12.024 --> 00:16:14.093
and played it,

247
00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:16.362
all the boys in the village...

248
00:16:16.462 --> 00:16:18.464
stared at me with their mouths open.

249
00:16:20.232 --> 00:16:23.202
But even though I like playing janggu so much,

250
00:16:23.335 --> 00:16:24.903
I can't play anymore.

251
00:16:25.304 --> 00:16:27.573
It's because my shoulder hurts.

252
00:16:27.673 --> 00:16:29.475
Just wait a moment.

253
00:16:29.475 --> 00:16:31.910
Gosh, my back hurts.

254
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.212
Let me take a look.

255
00:16:33.212 --> 00:16:35.381
Gosh, my knee hurts. My ankle too.

256
00:16:35.381 --> 00:16:38.050
My head hurts so much.

257
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.120
Goodness. Where on earth should I apply acupuncture on her?

258
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.322
Nothing seemed to be wrong when I examined her pulse.

259
00:16:43.322 --> 00:16:47.559
Head, shoulders, knees, and toes

260
00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:48.861
You'd better apply it everywhere.

261
00:16:50.062 --> 00:16:51.630
- Where do you mean? - Hold on, hold on.

262
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.099
I can do it. Let me see.

263
00:16:58.504 --> 00:17:00.639
This is why people say...

264
00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:03.375
one's body is the same as one's resume.

265
00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:06.612
You get hurt here and there in your life.

266
00:17:06.612 --> 00:17:09.415
All those incidents remain in your body...

267
00:17:09.415 --> 00:17:12.251
and raise a clamor, right?

268
00:17:12.251 --> 00:17:14.820
Some people consider these signs in your body as a medal.

269
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.222
Others consider them as sorrow.

270
00:17:17.222 --> 00:17:19.491
But what can we do about it?

271
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:23.162
We should gently soothe the pain and live on.

272
00:17:23.162 --> 00:17:25.831
You're right. We should.

273
00:17:26.832 --> 00:17:27.833
Let's see.

274
00:17:30.135 --> 00:17:32.271
Here goes the needle.

275
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:38.010
Excuse me.

276
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.381
Mr. Choi, I am making my bow as an oriental doctor today.

277
00:17:42.881 --> 00:17:44.850
Could you please give me a chance?

278
00:17:45.284 --> 00:17:46.652
Will you do this?

279
00:17:46.652 --> 00:17:48.654
Yes.

280
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.691
Here we go.

281
00:17:53.592 --> 00:17:54.893
It feels so nice.

282
00:17:54.893 --> 00:17:56.261
Does it?

283
00:17:57.162 --> 00:17:58.230
My goodness.

284
00:17:58.664 --> 00:17:59.865
Good.

285
00:18:01.133 --> 00:18:02.701
Can you do it on my feet?

286
00:18:05.704 --> 00:18:07.272
Thank you for the acupuncture.

287
00:18:07.272 --> 00:18:10.275
- Bye. - Bye, Mom.

288
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.680
- Let's go. - Yes, let's go.

289
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:25.324
Do you think...

290
00:18:27.192 --> 00:18:29.061
we only treat illness here?

291
00:18:29.895 --> 00:18:31.630
To those old people,

292
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.032
it's not just a place where they get acupuncture.

293
00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:36.101
It's a place...

294
00:18:36.101 --> 00:18:38.170
where they embrace their heart and share the sadness.

295
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.674
Mr. Choi.

296
00:18:44.143 --> 00:18:46.745
I think you need to get treated too.

297
00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:49.381
It looks like your heart is not in a good condition.

298
00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:50.983
What are you talking about?

299
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.654
I'm an old man. It's natural that something is not working well.

300
00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.492
I can examine your pulse properly.

301
00:19:00.492 --> 00:19:03.195
You punk! I've examined pulse...

302
00:19:03.195 --> 00:19:05.431
thousands of times more than you've done so far.

303
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:07.132
I know well about my disease.

304
00:19:07.132 --> 00:19:09.435
So mind your own business!

305
00:19:13.071 --> 00:19:15.140
Don't say a thing about this to Yeon Kyung!

306
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.842
If you ever say something to her,

307
00:19:16.842 --> 00:19:18.744
I will definitely kick you out of here!

308
00:19:46.472 --> 00:19:49.575
Why in the world did you do that at Chairman Min's place?

309
00:19:49.842 --> 00:19:51.210
If I had not done so,

310
00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.512
you would not have let me go.

311
00:19:53.512 --> 00:19:56.215
Have you forgotten what I have done for you?

312
00:19:57.382 --> 00:19:59.051
No, I have not.

313
00:19:59.451 --> 00:20:01.620
You reminded me of the path I have to go.

314
00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:03.922
I will never forget that.

315
00:20:03.922 --> 00:20:04.990
So...

316
00:20:05.324 --> 00:20:08.460
is this old-fashioned oriental medicine clinic...

317
00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:10.762
the path you have to go?

318
00:20:10.762 --> 00:20:13.131
I could make money by selling medical techniques,

319
00:20:13.532 --> 00:20:15.701
but I thought that would not make me happy enough.

320
00:20:15.701 --> 00:20:17.002
What about your license?

321
00:20:17.302 --> 00:20:18.971
If I report you to the police,

322
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:20.873
you cannot get away with it.

323
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.709
You are the one who made it for me,

324
00:20:24.343 --> 00:20:26.144
so I guess you cannot get away with it either.

325
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.982
I guess you should go back now.

326
00:20:33.852 --> 00:20:35.053
Come to think of it,

327
00:20:36.822 --> 00:20:40.792
there's something I haven't taught you yet.

328
00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:45.230
Power and money.

329
00:20:46.999 --> 00:20:48.834
It's hard for a person to get them,

330
00:20:50.502 --> 00:20:53.872
but it's easy to be trampled on by them.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.392
Dr. Heo turned in his resignation...

335
00:21:13.392 --> 00:21:15.294
and went to Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic.

336
00:21:24.202 --> 00:21:25.270
Hey, Yeon Kyung!

337
00:21:27.239 --> 00:21:29.942
I heard that patient with aortic dissection hasn't woken up yet.

338
00:21:29.942 --> 00:21:32.611
So why did you ignore medical evidence and statistics?

339
00:21:32.611 --> 00:21:34.780
What's the use of becoming a fellow?

340
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.249
You're still thinking like an intern!

341
00:21:39.952 --> 00:21:41.954
Even if I become a professor and a department head,

342
00:21:43.322 --> 00:21:45.991
I would do the same thing in such a situation.

343
00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:49.294
You haven't come your senses yet.

344
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.232
Yes, that patient with aortic dissection...

345
00:21:54.933 --> 00:21:56.101
woke up, you said?

346
00:21:58.103 --> 00:22:00.172
Yes, I got it. Bye.

347
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.742
Is it a miracle then?

348
00:22:03.742 --> 00:22:06.511
Well, I'll see you again.

349
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:19.691
Sir.

350
00:22:21.393 --> 00:22:22.761
Can you hear me?

351
00:22:25.764 --> 00:22:27.299
Can you raise your arm?

352
00:22:31.169 --> 00:22:32.471
This time, your leg.

353
00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:41.179
You did a good job.

354
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.315
Thank you.

355
00:22:46.752 --> 00:22:50.622
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

356
00:22:58.764 --> 00:23:00.799
I didn't save the patient.

357
00:23:04.102 --> 00:23:06.972
The patient's love for his family...

358
00:23:07.773 --> 00:23:09.441
saved himself.

359
00:23:10.442 --> 00:23:11.543
What?

360
00:23:11.943 --> 00:23:14.513
You even speak in such a nice way!

361
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.382
He still needs joint treatment.

362
00:23:17.849 --> 00:23:21.219
He may need several more surgeries.

363
00:23:23.355 --> 00:23:25.090
You must brace yourself.

364
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.061
Doctor, thank you. Thank you so much.

365
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.085
I should tell him.

366
00:23:54.553 --> 00:23:57.522
I should share this good news with him.

367
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:05.030
I forgot. He doesn't have a cell phone.

368
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.899
What's the matter? Can't you reach your boyfriend?

369
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.901
Ms. Jung.

370
00:24:10.001 --> 00:24:12.170
You surprise me a lot these days.

371
00:24:13.105 --> 00:24:14.740
Is it the power of love?

372
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.041
Pardon?

373
00:24:17.042 --> 00:24:18.110
Come with me.

374
00:24:21.113 --> 00:24:22.080
Okay.

375
00:24:23.315 --> 00:24:24.483
(Sick leave application form)

376
00:24:25.383 --> 00:24:27.819
- It's sick leave application form. - Ms. Jung...

377
00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:29.821
You performed a surgery for a long time in such a bad condition.

378
00:24:29.821 --> 00:24:31.523
No wonder you're feeling sick.

379
00:24:33.391 --> 00:24:36.361
No, I'm fine.

380
00:24:36.361 --> 00:24:38.630
If you want to stay as a doctor for a short while,

381
00:24:39.164 --> 00:24:40.265
you may do so.

382
00:24:41.032 --> 00:24:42.100
Come on.

383
00:24:43.101 --> 00:24:45.470
Thank you for worrying about me,

384
00:24:46.104 --> 00:24:48.540
but I need to observe the patient's progress.

385
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.879
That patient's doctor changed a little while ago.

386
00:24:54.412 --> 00:24:55.413
What? Who is it?

387
00:24:55.413 --> 00:24:59.184
It's Dr. Kang Man Soo. He's a very competent one.

388
00:25:04.222 --> 00:25:05.223
Hey, Dr. Kang.

389
00:25:06.024 --> 00:25:07.893
Come on. You're not the only doctor here.

390
00:25:07.893 --> 00:25:11.029
I'm a doctor too. You may not consider anyone a doctor anyway.

391
00:25:11.163 --> 00:25:12.964
You think you're the only doctor.

392
00:25:13.331 --> 00:25:14.833
- What do you think? - I agree with you.

393
00:25:21.339 --> 00:25:22.574
Goodness.

394
00:25:31.049 --> 00:25:32.050
Jae Ha!

395
00:25:34.252 --> 00:25:35.353
What are you doing here?

396
00:25:35.353 --> 00:25:37.622
Why do you ask that all the time? You know the answer.

397
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.358
- Are you getting off? - Yes.

398
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.129
I took a sick leave for a few days.

399
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.332
You would not do that just because you're a little sick.

400
00:25:48.834 --> 00:25:50.802
Are you going to meet him?

401
00:25:53.305 --> 00:25:54.339
Yes.

402
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.775
What are you doing to do?

403
00:25:59.044 --> 00:26:00.312
Aren't you going to regret it?

404
00:26:01.813 --> 00:26:03.081
I may regret doing so.

405
00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:07.452
Still...

406
00:26:09.921 --> 00:26:11.923
he's staying with me.

407
00:26:15.393 --> 00:26:17.329
I'd like to follow my heart.

408
00:26:29.341 --> 00:26:30.909
Why is it so quiet here?

409
00:26:31.409 --> 00:26:33.511
Did they leave work already?

410
00:26:41.553 --> 00:26:42.921
Where did he go?

411
00:26:45.824 --> 00:26:47.792
Bong Tak.

412
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.042
What? Oh, you're here.

413
00:27:04.342 --> 00:27:06.711
- You finished work early... - Grandpa, where is he?

414
00:27:08.179 --> 00:27:09.514
Where is he?

415
00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:10.982
What?

416
00:27:26.831 --> 00:27:28.033
Bok Man.

417
00:27:28.033 --> 00:27:30.402
I made fried rice for you.

418
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:33.004
You shared your food last time, so I am giving you this out of gratitude.

419
00:27:33.305 --> 00:27:36.141
Do not mind it and enjoy the food.

420
00:27:38.043 --> 00:27:39.210
Good dog.

421
00:27:40.979 --> 00:27:42.280
So cute.

422
00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:46.651
You pretty dog.

423
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.322
Oh, you are here.

424
00:27:50.989 --> 00:27:52.190
Yeon Kyung.

425
00:28:04.703 --> 00:28:07.639
Yeon Kyung. Are you okay?

426
00:28:08.239 --> 00:28:11.509
Why did you fall down on your back? It's where you got injured.

427
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:12.844
Why did you do that?

428
00:28:15.714 --> 00:28:16.982
Are you crazy?

429
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.352
Why did you hurry so much?

430
00:28:20.352 --> 00:28:22.721
What if you bumped your head on the ground or something?

431
00:28:23.054 --> 00:28:26.191
Always be careful.

432
00:28:26.491 --> 00:28:29.394
Be careful while walking on streets. Be careful when you're in a car.

433
00:28:29.494 --> 00:28:31.730
It's dangerous everywhere here.

434
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.000
So walk slowly on streets, okay?

435
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.002
Take it slow.

436
00:28:50.982 --> 00:28:52.050
Have you forgotten?

437
00:28:54.452 --> 00:28:55.920
I promised you...

438
00:28:56.988 --> 00:29:00.291
that I would not leave you alone ever again.

439
00:29:04.329 --> 00:29:07.399
I will be extra careful from now on.

440
00:29:11.002 --> 00:29:12.771
Even if I happen to time travel again,

441
00:29:13.938 --> 00:29:15.273
I will come back right away.

442
00:29:16.641 --> 00:29:18.510
So do not worry about it.

443
00:29:31.723 --> 00:29:33.491
I wasn't worried.

444
00:29:44.135 --> 00:29:45.303
Ta-da.

445
00:29:49.174 --> 00:29:50.742
Look at you.

446
00:29:52.277 --> 00:29:55.213
Why would you take away what you gave me?

447
00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.581
Because it's mine.

448
00:30:00.118 --> 00:30:03.555
Come quickly. We have meat as our main dish today.

449
00:30:05.423 --> 00:30:06.991
It's meat.

450
00:30:07.292 --> 00:30:08.726
You won't have dinner with us?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

451
00:30:10.662 --> 00:30:11.830
You should...

452
00:30:17.302 --> 00:30:20.972
Well, it's been a while since I last had meat. Shall I have some?

453
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.842
Sit here.

454
00:30:23.842 --> 00:30:27.212
- It is meat. - I'll go get your rice.

455
00:30:42.393 --> 00:30:43.661
Not a chance.

456
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.664
I told you it's my meat.

457
00:30:51.302 --> 00:30:54.072
Still, it's such a delicious meal.

458
00:31:07.452 --> 00:31:09.254
You can't give him that much. It's for you.

459
00:31:09.254 --> 00:31:11.756
It is not that much. She gave me only this amount.

460
00:31:11.756 --> 00:31:13.091
Your bowl is full of meat.

461
00:31:13.591 --> 00:31:16.861
It looks a lot because the meat is big.

462
00:31:16.961 --> 00:31:18.396
Are you going to have it all?

463
00:31:35.747 --> 00:31:39.050
It is not late at night. Did she already go to bed?

464
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.325
Yeon Kyung.

465
00:31:48.693 --> 00:31:50.028
Yeon Kyung.

466
00:31:56.167 --> 00:31:58.102
- What are you doing? - Well...

467
00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.038
I cannot get to sleep.

468
00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:01.573
That's good.

469
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.441
Is Grandpa asleep?

470
00:32:05.543 --> 00:32:06.844
I think so.

471
00:32:10.615 --> 00:32:11.716
It's a gift for you.

472
00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.352
What is this?

473
00:32:15.386 --> 00:32:16.721
A cell phone.

474
00:32:21.893 --> 00:32:26.431
I was anxious not being able to reach you anyway.

475
00:32:27.031 --> 00:32:29.234
Thank you.

476
00:32:30.835 --> 00:32:32.036
Well...

477
00:32:32.704 --> 00:32:35.006
I need to get your number.

478
00:32:46.684 --> 00:32:49.153
(My Gum)

479
00:32:49.354 --> 00:32:51.322
"My gum"?

480
00:32:53.825 --> 00:32:55.493
This is great.

481
00:33:00.431 --> 00:33:01.633
Look.

482
00:33:02.767 --> 00:33:05.103
Do you not regret leaving everything behind?

483
00:33:07.205 --> 00:33:08.673
I know you love money.

484
00:33:10.475 --> 00:33:11.776
I do not.

485
00:33:11.876 --> 00:33:14.112
What is it that I saw in Joseon then?

486
00:33:16.114 --> 00:33:17.882
That is my anger and empty heart.

487
00:33:18.983 --> 00:33:20.585
And how I lived my life.

488
00:33:22.587 --> 00:33:24.422
In order to put up with...

489
00:33:26.291 --> 00:33:28.393
hardstanding moments as a doctor in such a generation,

490
00:33:31.062 --> 00:33:32.964
I needed to possess at least something.

491
00:33:35.133 --> 00:33:36.834
But no matter how much I saved up,

492
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.972
I could not fill my empty heart.

493
00:33:46.911 --> 00:33:50.415
Though I have nothing, I am the happiest now.

494
00:33:53.785 --> 00:33:55.820
I find happiness in trivial things.

495
00:33:57.922 --> 00:33:59.257
It is all thanks to you.

496
00:34:04.295 --> 00:34:07.532
You left me behind at the bar to secure your fortunes then.

497
00:34:07.832 --> 00:34:09.100
You are mistaken.

498
00:34:10.234 --> 00:34:12.236
You are mistaken. I already told you so.

499
00:34:12.236 --> 00:34:14.005
Then why did you go there?

500
00:34:14.005 --> 00:34:16.274
That was because I needed money for your security...

501
00:34:16.274 --> 00:34:18.676
in case something happened to me.

502
00:34:18.676 --> 00:34:21.112
Gosh, it is a misunderstanding.

503
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.550
Okay, let's say it's a misunderstanding.

504
00:34:25.683 --> 00:34:27.151
Gosh, what are you talking about?

505
00:34:27.151 --> 00:34:29.554
I mean it. It is really a misunderstanding.

506
00:34:29.554 --> 00:34:31.456
You are mistaken.

507
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:33.825
I said okay.

508
00:34:34.692 --> 00:34:35.860
Okay.

509
00:34:40.331 --> 00:34:41.833
My gum.

510
00:34:43.267 --> 00:34:44.535
Thank you so much.

511
00:34:49.307 --> 00:34:50.942
Bong Tak.

512
00:34:51.642 --> 00:34:53.578
Bong Tak.

513
00:34:55.213 --> 00:34:58.483
I wanted to sleep in. Why is it so noisy outside?

514
00:35:20.071 --> 00:35:21.406
It is too spicy.

515
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.012
All right. Begin.

516
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.481
It is an unbelievable moment.

517
00:35:30.481 --> 00:35:31.783
Wash it clean.

518
00:35:31.783 --> 00:35:34.252
Okay.

519
00:35:34.252 --> 00:35:36.888
I think this fits you. You're going to do this every time.

520
00:35:36.888 --> 00:35:39.424
Okay. What did I just say?

521
00:35:39.824 --> 00:35:42.360
Raise your right hand and tap here.

522
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.362
By tapping here, it will help your circulation.

523
00:35:44.362 --> 00:35:45.997
You will become energetic.

524
00:35:45.997 --> 00:35:47.064
Do the other side now.

525
00:35:48.633 --> 00:35:51.302
If we clap our hands like this,

526
00:35:51.302 --> 00:35:53.971
it will feel refreshing and our organs will become healthy.

527
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:56.808
You two really must be conscious about your health.

528
00:35:56.808 --> 00:35:58.042
Do you do it like this?

529
00:36:01.813 --> 00:36:03.681
Yeon Kyung, does it hurt? What's wrong?

530
00:36:03.681 --> 00:36:05.483
You're not hurt?

531
00:36:05.483 --> 00:36:07.452
Now embrace each other.

532
00:36:08.152 --> 00:36:09.454
You idiot.

533
00:36:10.087 --> 00:36:11.122
Idiot.

534
00:36:15.493 --> 00:36:18.362
- You should hug her. - I don't know what to do.

535
00:36:19.464 --> 00:36:20.765
Help us.

536
00:36:23.434 --> 00:36:24.702
Help us.

537
00:36:28.306 --> 00:36:30.174
- Oh, my. - What's wrong?

538
00:36:33.044 --> 00:36:34.745
Shin Myung Hoon became the new chairman...

539
00:36:34.745 --> 00:36:37.281
of the board of Shinhae foundation.

540
00:36:46.657 --> 00:36:49.060
- Of course. - Congratulations.

541
00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.463
- Thank you. - The flowers are beautiful.

542
00:36:53.297 --> 00:36:54.332
Thank you.

543
00:36:54.332 --> 00:36:57.301
(Shin Myung Hoon, 5th chairman of the board of Shinhae foundation)

544
00:36:57.301 --> 00:36:58.603
Hello.

545
00:37:12.116 --> 00:37:13.184
Get the car ready.

546
00:37:13.184 --> 00:37:14.385
Yes, sir.

547
00:37:18.422 --> 00:37:19.457
Lay him down.

548
00:37:38.643 --> 00:37:40.711
Does he have asthma?

549
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:42.880
- What? - Asthma.

550
00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.383
That's right. He has asthma.

551
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.386
His bronchial tubes are narrowed, so he can't breathe.

552
00:37:48.953 --> 00:37:51.022
I think he has acute asthma.

553
00:37:53.991 --> 00:37:55.126
Can you hear me?

554
00:37:55.693 --> 00:37:57.161
Please breathe deeply.

555
00:37:59.463 --> 00:38:00.731
One more time.

556
00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:07.672
Try breathing.

557
00:38:12.043 --> 00:38:14.345
I widened his bronchial tubes temporarily,

558
00:38:14.345 --> 00:38:16.447
but an emergency can happen anytime.

559
00:38:16.447 --> 00:38:17.815
I think we need to call the ambulance.

560
00:38:17.815 --> 00:38:19.717
Call the ambulance.

561
00:38:19.717 --> 00:38:22.153
We can't go to the hospital.

562
00:38:22.553 --> 00:38:24.722
We can't go.

563
00:38:24.722 --> 00:38:26.991
An emergency can happen anytime.

564
00:38:26.991 --> 00:38:28.793
We need to call the ambulance. Please call it.

565
00:38:28.793 --> 00:38:30.895
We can't. We will get caught.

566
00:38:31.295 --> 00:38:33.764
We will have to go home.

567
00:38:40.371 --> 00:38:43.507
Why do they not want to go to the hospital?

568
00:38:44.442 --> 00:38:47.044
It's because they are illegal aliens.

569
00:38:53.584 --> 00:38:56.587
We can't.

570
00:38:59.924 --> 00:39:03.494
Did you not say that patients did not need any qualifications?

571
00:39:03.894 --> 00:39:05.663
That's because...

572
00:39:07.031 --> 00:39:09.467
It's hard to explain.

573
00:39:12.803 --> 00:39:13.804
Then,

574
00:39:14.805 --> 00:39:16.140
can I try?

575
00:39:21.412 --> 00:39:23.080
They might look different from us,

576
00:39:23.681 --> 00:39:25.383
but their internal organs must be the same.

577
00:40:00.751 --> 00:40:02.053
It will not hurt.

578
00:40:21.272 --> 00:40:23.207
Please raise his knees.

579
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.722
It is okay.

580
00:40:38.522 --> 00:40:41.726
I will put acupuncture on you.

581
00:40:43.127 --> 00:40:45.262
Please do not move.

582
00:40:45.262 --> 00:40:47.031
I might pierce your lungs.

583
00:40:51.435 --> 00:40:53.170
- Please help me. - Okay.

584
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.573
Raise him. I need to put it deeper.

585
00:40:56.574 --> 00:40:59.143
- Okay. - Don't move.

586
00:41:09.453 --> 00:41:10.721
That's Cheondol.

587
00:41:11.122 --> 00:41:13.190
It's the most dangerous acupuncture point.

588
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:16.694
He's skillful enough to do it. Ordinary people can't.

589
00:41:45.956 --> 00:41:47.024
It is okay.

590
00:41:51.862 --> 00:41:53.831
- You're okay. - You endured it well.

591
00:41:54.431 --> 00:41:57.701
We must apply moxa and the steam of medicine to you.

592
00:41:57.701 --> 00:41:58.903
Please bear a little further.

593
00:41:58.903 --> 00:42:00.404
I can do that.

594
00:42:21.292 --> 00:42:22.593
I am okay now.

595
00:42:22.693 --> 00:42:24.795
You healed me.

596
00:42:24.862 --> 00:42:27.031
Thank you for saving my friend.

597
00:42:28.032 --> 00:42:29.066
This is your medicine.

598
00:42:29.066 --> 00:42:30.601
- Take it. - Thank you.

599
00:42:42.213 --> 00:42:43.581
This is my family.

600
00:42:44.014 --> 00:42:47.751
Thank you for letting me keep sending them money.

601
00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.422
They're adorable.

602
00:42:55.926 --> 00:42:57.761
Thank you so much.

603
00:42:59.997 --> 00:43:01.432
Take care.

604
00:43:08.272 --> 00:43:10.341
- Master Choi. - Why?

605
00:43:10.341 --> 00:43:12.543
I need to go somewhere.

606
00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:14.411
What?

607
00:43:16.814 --> 00:43:19.850
You are not even well.

608
00:43:20.651 --> 00:43:22.887
Just rest at home. Why are you being stubborn?

609
00:43:23.854 --> 00:43:25.856
Did you forget that I'm unpredictable?

610
00:43:25.856 --> 00:43:29.093
Are you my gum now?

611
00:43:39.837 --> 00:43:40.871
Jae Ha.

612
00:43:44.341 --> 00:43:46.710
Are you going somewhere together?

613
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:48.212
Yes.

614
00:43:53.884 --> 00:43:54.985
Why are you here?

615
00:43:55.653 --> 00:43:59.123
I'm going to do whatever I want from now on.

616
00:43:59.123 --> 00:44:01.091
Why would you want to come here?

617
00:44:01.091 --> 00:44:02.960
Why don't you just go back to Joseon?

618
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.161
I am not going.

619
00:44:04.662 --> 00:44:06.764
- Where are you going? - To do medical services.

620
00:44:06.764 --> 00:44:09.700
Really? I don't have any appointments in the afternoon.

621
00:44:10.067 --> 00:44:11.635
- Can I go with you? - You cannot.

622
00:44:11.635 --> 00:44:13.203
It's not a date.

623
00:44:13.203 --> 00:44:16.073
Isn't it better if you have more doctors for medical services?

624
00:44:17.241 --> 00:44:18.442
A date?

625
00:44:19.376 --> 00:44:20.711
Don't worry.

626
00:44:20.945 --> 00:44:22.880
I'm not going to bother you.

627
00:44:23.714 --> 00:44:26.517
I just want to check something.

628
00:44:28.786 --> 00:44:29.853
Follow us then.

629
00:44:30.154 --> 00:44:32.022
Yeon Kyung, let us go.

630
00:44:32.656 --> 00:44:33.691
Yeon Kyung.

631
00:44:35.192 --> 00:44:36.226
Let's drive my car.

632
00:44:36.527 --> 00:44:38.262
Don't you know that she's still a patient?

633
00:44:38.562 --> 00:44:42.132
You wouldn't know how hard driving is.

634
00:44:43.901 --> 00:44:45.602
- I'm okay. - Let's go.

635
00:44:49.707 --> 00:44:50.741
Wait.

636
00:44:54.712 --> 00:44:56.347
Yeon Kyung, get in.

637
00:45:30.714 --> 00:45:32.116
Do you want to go back?

638
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:35.486
No. What about me? I'm fine.

639
00:45:35.552 --> 00:45:37.621
- Really? - Yes.

640
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:41.191
Be quiet, you punks.

641
00:45:41.992 --> 00:45:43.027
Hello.

642
00:45:43.861 --> 00:45:46.397
Who... Wait, you!

643
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:47.731
Let's go.

644
00:45:53.404 --> 00:45:57.541
You ran away that day. Why are you here?

645
00:45:58.175 --> 00:46:01.211
Where is the man who suffered from stomachache that day?

646
00:46:02.513 --> 00:46:03.781
That guy?

647
00:46:04.381 --> 00:46:05.582
He's gone.

648
00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:08.585
He is gone? Do you mean...

649
00:46:08.585 --> 00:46:10.220
I said he's gone...

650
00:46:11.355 --> 00:46:12.423
over there.

651
00:46:25.335 --> 00:46:28.472
- Sir. - What? Who are you?

652
00:46:29.973 --> 00:46:34.111
I am an oriental doctor. May I check your pulse?

653
00:46:40.117 --> 00:46:41.852
Please lie down straight.

654
00:46:51.462 --> 00:46:53.630
It must have hurt a lot.

655
00:46:54.431 --> 00:46:56.033
It hurts even now.

656
00:46:56.033 --> 00:46:57.901
Let me apply acupuncture.

657
00:47:36.874 --> 00:47:40.210
It was killing me for several days.

658
00:47:40.611 --> 00:47:42.312
I feel much better now.

659
00:47:43.213 --> 00:47:44.314
I am glad to hear it.

660
00:47:49.953 --> 00:47:51.822
Take this medicine every day.

661
00:47:51.955 --> 00:47:55.192
It will not eat up too much of your time since it is easy to take.

662
00:47:55.993 --> 00:47:57.161
Thank you.

663
00:47:57.261 --> 00:47:58.762
I am sorry about the other day.

664
00:47:59.263 --> 00:48:00.330
What?

665
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.401
He's become...

666
00:48:04.401 --> 00:48:07.571
a totally different person.

667
00:48:09.473 --> 00:48:11.642
By the way,

668
00:48:12.242 --> 00:48:14.511
why are you not with your family at your house?

669
00:48:14.511 --> 00:48:16.747
It's more like...

670
00:48:17.381 --> 00:48:20.450
I can't go, and I can't meet them.

671
00:48:41.271 --> 00:48:42.506
Mr. Chairman.

672
00:48:43.473 --> 00:48:45.742
Please give me one more chance.

673
00:48:47.411 --> 00:48:48.645
Please.

674
00:48:48.712 --> 00:48:52.182
Well, if that's what you want...

675
00:48:53.417 --> 00:48:54.751
You know,

676
00:48:55.452 --> 00:48:58.322
the guy named Heo Bong Tak whom you mentioned the other day.

677
00:48:59.223 --> 00:49:00.290
Please go on.

678
00:49:01.291 --> 00:49:05.195
I'd like him to apply acupuncture on one of my family members...

679
00:49:06.396 --> 00:49:07.831
who is a patient.

680
00:49:12.603 --> 00:49:14.605
Your joint seems to work fine.

681
00:49:15.072 --> 00:49:17.341
I think it is due to the pain in your muscle.

682
00:49:28.252 --> 00:49:31.622
Hey, not everybody is allowed to check the pulse here.

683
00:49:31.622 --> 00:49:34.291
Come over here. You punk.

684
00:49:34.391 --> 00:49:36.960
- Dr. Heo. Help me. - Goodness.

685
00:49:37.194 --> 00:49:38.795
- Look at me. - Dr. Heo.

686
00:49:39.463 --> 00:49:41.131
- Dr. Heo. - Give me a moment.

687
00:49:42.332 --> 00:49:43.700
Just a second.

688
00:49:44.735 --> 00:49:47.471
- Calm down. - Goodness.

689
00:49:47.471 --> 00:49:49.706
Sir, this is Dr. Yoo Jae Ha.

690
00:49:49.806 --> 00:49:51.541
He is a competent oriental doctor.

691
00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:53.910
You can trust him.

692
00:49:54.311 --> 00:49:56.313
You should've told me sooner.

693
00:49:57.314 --> 00:50:00.284
There is nothing special to it. Just do what you have been doing.

694
00:50:01.351 --> 00:50:02.886
- Okay. - Relax.

695
00:50:02.986 --> 00:50:04.154
Relax.

696
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:22.873
Since when did you start to cough like this?

697
00:50:22.906 --> 00:50:26.043
A long time ago. My nose is stuffed up.

698
00:50:26.877 --> 00:50:28.812
I feel suffocated because of phlegm.

699
00:50:29.646 --> 00:50:34.051
I think it's postnasal drip. Could you open your mouth?

700
00:50:45.395 --> 00:50:47.431
Mucus is supposed to run forward,

701
00:50:47.864 --> 00:50:50.500
but yours goes backwards, and it's irritating your throat.

702
00:50:54.771 --> 00:50:56.173
Hey.

703
00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.342
Run away.

704
00:50:58.542 --> 00:51:01.411
- Hurry. - Run.

705
00:51:01.411 --> 00:51:02.746
- Hurry. - Goodness.

706
00:51:09.252 --> 00:51:11.521
- Why are we running? - I do not know.

707
00:51:11.621 --> 00:51:13.457
I am running because they are running.

708
00:51:13.457 --> 00:51:15.325
You don't know why you're running?

709
00:51:15.325 --> 00:51:16.993
The elderly is always right.

710
00:51:16.993 --> 00:51:18.462
Let us run first and think later.

711
00:51:47.391 --> 00:51:49.092
Those people...

712
00:51:56.933 --> 00:51:59.302
- What is that you are wearing? - Sunglasses.

713
00:51:59.302 --> 00:52:00.570
It looks awesome.

714
00:52:03.874 --> 00:52:05.475
Where are you, Yeon Kyung?

715
00:52:06.343 --> 00:52:09.112
Here. You are here.

716
00:52:13.016 --> 00:52:14.184
Women do that...

717
00:52:14.985 --> 00:52:16.853
in Joseon too.

718
00:52:17.754 --> 00:52:19.156
People are watching.

719
00:52:19.156 --> 00:52:20.690
It's pretty.

720
00:52:25.595 --> 00:52:27.564
I cannot check how I look.

721
00:52:31.034 --> 00:52:32.202
It is the sea.

722
00:52:37.474 --> 00:52:38.775
It is the sea.

723
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:41.011
You've never been to a sea before?

724
00:52:41.044 --> 00:52:43.480
I lived in Jeju Island for a long time, so it is not my first time.

725
00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.616
But it is great to be at a beach like this after 10 years.

726
00:52:46.883 --> 00:52:48.251
Thank you for taking me here.

727
00:52:48.652 --> 00:52:51.021
This is what you do at a beach.

728
00:53:08.371 --> 00:53:09.573
Look at that.

729
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.342
What is that?

730
00:53:13.643 --> 00:53:15.011
It is a heart.

731
00:53:15.712 --> 00:53:19.382
Ha Ra taught me about it.

732
00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:21.551
She said there are two meanings to it.

733
00:53:22.452 --> 00:53:23.620
Human's heart.

734
00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.823
Your heart races when you like someone.

735
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:30.093
So it means a human's heart and love as well.

736
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.562
The love for someone.

737
00:53:32.863 --> 00:53:34.731
I guess that is how you express your love in this world.

738
00:53:37.234 --> 00:53:38.401
I want one of that too.

739
00:53:41.271 --> 00:53:42.572
Wait a second.

740
00:53:42.973 --> 00:53:45.442
I will make it quickly.

741
00:53:56.052 --> 00:53:57.420
Draw it bigger.

742
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:02.392
Over there too.

743
00:54:06.796 --> 00:54:08.465
Don't come yet. Draw that side too.

744
00:54:21.011 --> 00:54:22.145
Follow me.

745
00:54:24.714 --> 00:54:25.782
Look.

746
00:54:25.782 --> 00:54:28.752
(Lim, Yeon Kyung)

747
00:54:29.586 --> 00:54:31.021
Is that Cupid's arrow?

748
00:54:31.221 --> 00:54:34.424
Cupid? What is that? I drew a needle.

749
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:36.893
Oh, that's a needle.

750
00:54:37.961 --> 00:54:39.563
It is my heart for you.

751
00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:42.432
The moment when you applied acupuncture on my heart.

752
00:54:42.832 --> 00:54:44.601
I will never be able to forget that moment.

753
00:54:55.946 --> 00:54:59.583
There's something I really wanted to do with a man on a beach.

754
00:54:59.883 --> 00:55:01.751
What is that?

755
00:55:02.852 --> 00:55:04.521
Catch me if you can.

756
00:55:07.424 --> 00:55:09.960
Why must I catch you?

757
00:55:12.062 --> 00:55:13.430
You won't come?

758
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:14.564
I will go.

759
00:55:26.743 --> 00:55:28.311
Yes! I placed first!

760
00:55:40.991 --> 00:55:42.192
You too.

761
00:55:42.993 --> 00:55:43.960
Yu Na.

762
00:55:46.963 --> 00:55:48.331
It's so delicious.

763
00:55:49.666 --> 00:55:51.001
Eat up.

764
00:55:51.001 --> 00:55:52.335
You should eat up too.

765
00:55:52.335 --> 00:55:53.336
All right.

766
00:56:26.503 --> 00:56:28.104
They did not give us medicine.

767
00:56:28.104 --> 00:56:31.007
They took away what we had.

768
00:56:31.007 --> 00:56:33.510
We do not know when the war will be over,

769
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:35.378
and yet, we have no medicine.

770
00:56:35.378 --> 00:56:36.780
This is a big problem.

771
00:56:39.683 --> 00:56:42.652
So are you going to stay?

772
00:56:43.153 --> 00:56:44.354
Are you out of your mind?

773
00:56:44.821 --> 00:56:46.523
All the warriors and officials...

774
00:56:46.523 --> 00:56:49.025
are running away leaving the people behind.

775
00:58:23.353 --> 00:58:25.321
He was a good doctor,

776
00:58:25.321 --> 00:58:27.423
one that we need in Joseon.

777
00:58:27.857 --> 00:58:30.693
It would not be easy to make him realize his faults,

778
00:58:31.294 --> 00:58:34.764
but I thought that you could be able to help him.

779
00:59:13.036 --> 00:59:14.971
Can we really do this?

780
00:59:14.971 --> 00:59:18.441
You should just do as I say.

781
00:59:18.741 --> 00:59:21.010
- Hello? - Here.

782
00:59:23.479 --> 00:59:24.714
Come back tomorrow.

783
00:59:24.714 --> 00:59:28.251
- Yes, thank you. - Thank you.

784
00:59:28.251 --> 00:59:30.687
- Come back tomorrow. - Come back tomorrow.

785
00:59:30.687 --> 00:59:32.822
Excuse me.

786
00:59:33.523 --> 00:59:35.058
It's me.

787
00:59:35.058 --> 00:59:37.160
Who are you?

788
00:59:37.627 --> 00:59:38.695
It's me.

789
00:59:38.995 --> 00:59:40.730
Oh, my. It's Mr. Kim.

790
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:41.731
Yes.

791
00:59:42.198 --> 00:59:43.633
Hello.

792
00:59:44.467 --> 00:59:46.135
Mr. Park is here too.

793
00:59:46.135 --> 00:59:47.136
Yes.

794
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:50.240
You look so different.

795
00:59:51.674 --> 00:59:52.842
Yes.

796
00:59:52.909 --> 00:59:54.744
Well, yes.

797
00:59:59.916 --> 01:00:01.918
- Sir. - Yes?

798
01:00:01.918 --> 01:00:04.621
The clinic looks traditional...

799
01:00:04.621 --> 01:00:06.623
and nice.

800
01:00:06.756 --> 01:00:09.659
You look so much better now.

801
01:00:09.659 --> 01:00:10.927
We do?

802
01:00:11.561 --> 01:00:15.331
The shelter provides us with clothes once in a while.

803
01:00:15.331 --> 01:00:18.268
We were going to visit your clinic,

804
01:00:18.268 --> 01:00:19.569
so we wanted to be well-dressed.

805
01:00:19.569 --> 01:00:22.205
You don't need to act too formally with me.

806
01:00:22.572 --> 01:00:24.641
But it's nice to see you like this.

807
01:00:26.476 --> 01:00:30.046
But why did you come here?

808
01:00:31.247 --> 01:00:33.983
Is anyone else ill?

809
01:00:33.983 --> 01:00:35.518
Well, it's...

810
01:00:36.085 --> 01:00:37.654
It's about me.

811
01:00:38.021 --> 01:00:40.323
Why? Are you feeling ill?

812
01:00:40.323 --> 01:00:44.327
I had pork and kimchi soup and soju yesterday.

813
01:00:44.327 --> 01:00:48.531
I must have an upset stomach. I feel so stuffed.

814
01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:49.599
Yes.

815
01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:50.667
Welcome.

816
01:00:50.667 --> 01:00:52.302
Is that the case? Come here then.

817
01:00:52.302 --> 01:00:53.303
Yes.

818
01:01:05.248 --> 01:01:07.050
I do not think he has an upset stomach.

819
01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:09.519
- What? - Your pulse changes and...

820
01:01:09.519 --> 01:01:11.020
the stomach hardens when you have an upset stomach.

821
01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.557
But your pulse is normal, and your stomach soft and flexible.

822
01:01:14.791 --> 01:01:17.827
That means there is nothing wrong with your stomach.

823
01:01:17.827 --> 01:01:20.897
What? No, that can't be.

824
01:01:20.897 --> 01:01:24.600
Even now, I feel stuffy. It's killing me.

825
01:01:27.136 --> 01:01:28.137
What?

826
01:01:28.604 --> 01:01:31.874
Do you think I am lying or something?

827
01:01:31.874 --> 01:01:33.910
No, it was not something like that.

828
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:37.880
In that case, I will apply acupuncture to make you feel better.

829
01:01:38.681 --> 01:01:41.351
No, I want...

830
01:01:41.751 --> 01:01:45.355
the director to apply acupuncture.

831
01:01:45.922 --> 01:01:50.326
It's not that I don't trust you.

832
01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.997
It's just because I'm used to him.

833
01:01:56.432 --> 01:01:57.433
Really?

834
01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.868
All right then.

835
01:02:01.871 --> 01:02:03.039
Here.

836
01:02:05.074 --> 01:02:07.443
Why are you so nervous?

837
01:02:07.443 --> 01:02:09.545
You've done this several times before.

838
01:02:10.713 --> 01:02:12.648
- Relax. - Okay.

839
01:02:16.586 --> 01:02:19.022
Gosh, go easy on me.

840
01:02:25.461 --> 01:02:27.730
Gosh, it hurts.

841
01:02:29.966 --> 01:02:31.167
Here.

842
01:03:05.468 --> 01:03:07.403
Rest here for a while,

843
01:03:08.204 --> 01:03:11.507
- and then come outside. - Thank you. Thank you.

844
01:03:35.832 --> 01:03:38.568
You do not seem well.

845
01:03:39.035 --> 01:03:40.369
Is there any problem?

846
01:03:40.369 --> 01:03:44.207
No, I'm fine.

847
01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:45.775
Goodbye, sir.

848
01:03:45.775 --> 01:03:47.577
All right. Take care.

849
01:03:47.577 --> 01:03:48.911
Look after yourselves.

850
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.081
Let's go.

851
01:03:58.721 --> 01:04:00.123
What is happening to me?

852
01:04:05.761 --> 01:04:07.430
- Mr. Kim! - Mr. Kim!

853
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:09.098
Gosh.

854
01:04:09.332 --> 01:04:10.366
Why is he...

855
01:04:10.633 --> 01:04:12.468
What is wrong with him?

856
01:04:12.468 --> 01:04:14.770
Hey, wake up.

857
01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:16.639
I... I...

858
01:04:17.039 --> 01:04:18.107
Oh, my.

859
01:04:19.442 --> 01:04:20.676
How can this be?

860
01:04:20.843 --> 01:04:21.944
Gosh.

861
01:04:26.082 --> 01:04:27.683
Move over. Move, please.

862
01:04:29.919 --> 01:04:30.953
Oh, my.

863
01:04:31.821 --> 01:04:34.490
This happened after getting acupuncture here.

864
01:04:35.591 --> 01:04:38.828
Is it you again?

865
01:04:38.828 --> 01:04:41.330
Not him, that person.

866
01:04:42.398 --> 01:04:43.466
This old man?

867
01:04:43.733 --> 01:04:46.802
He always brought fake medicine dealers from the station.

868
01:04:46.802 --> 01:04:49.805
He became like this after getting acupuncture from that old man.

869
01:04:50.206 --> 01:04:52.508
Oh, my. I feel pressure on my chest.

870
01:04:52.508 --> 01:04:54.744
That is not true. Tell them the truth.

871
01:04:55.578 --> 01:04:57.880
Explain it at the station.

872
01:04:58.114 --> 01:05:01.951
You're arrested red-handed for...

873
01:05:02.151 --> 01:05:03.686
professional negligence resulting in injury.

874
01:05:04.754 --> 01:05:06.689
What are you doing?

875
01:05:06.923 --> 01:05:09.125
Please let him go.

876
01:05:09.158 --> 01:05:10.860
- It is a misunderstanding. - Let's go.

877
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.395
Sir, Master Choi.

878
01:05:12.895 --> 01:05:15.398
The patient fainted an hour ago, and the vitals are okay.

879
01:05:19.202 --> 01:05:20.369
What's wrong?

880
01:05:21.103 --> 01:05:22.471
I think it's a medical malpractice.

881
01:05:24.207 --> 01:05:25.508
What is this?

882
01:05:25.641 --> 01:05:26.976
What's that?

883
01:05:26.976 --> 01:05:28.444
- It's a needle. - Yes.

884
01:05:28.444 --> 01:05:30.146
He fainted from getting acupuncture at an oriental medicine clinic.

885
01:05:30.146 --> 01:05:31.681
The investigator will come later.

886
01:05:35.685 --> 01:05:37.954
Can you hear me?

887
01:05:38.287 --> 01:05:39.355
Yes.

888
01:05:40.089 --> 01:05:41.457
He's still conscious.

889
01:05:42.358 --> 01:05:44.627
Take his X-ray, and prepare an ultrasonic cardiogram.

890
01:05:44.694 --> 01:05:45.728
Okay.

891
01:05:51.367 --> 01:05:52.768
What kind of incompetent doctor did this?

892
01:05:56.305 --> 01:05:57.373
How could this happen?

893
01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.243
How could this happen again?

894
01:06:04.847 --> 01:06:05.881
Oh, my.

895
01:06:06.482 --> 01:06:09.085
Professional negligence?

896
01:06:09.318 --> 01:06:10.953
What does that mean?

897
01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.456
It's a crime for hurting someone by mistake...

898
01:06:13.656 --> 01:06:16.459
while doing their professional work.

899
01:06:16.692 --> 01:06:18.261
Mistake? What do you mean?

900
01:06:19.061 --> 01:06:21.030
What mistake did he make?

901
01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:23.532
He said that he applied acupuncture incorrectly.

902
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.169
That old man applied acupuncture. I saw it with my own eyes.

903
01:06:31.974 --> 01:06:35.578
What will happen to Master Choi?

904
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.183
Imprisonment for less than 5 years or a fine for 20,000 dollars.

905
01:06:41.884 --> 01:06:44.287
Five years imprisonment?

906
01:06:45.821 --> 01:06:47.189
That old man...

907
01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:50.059
might go to jail.

908
01:06:58.701 --> 01:07:00.603
The end of the needle pierced the heart.

909
01:07:02.338 --> 01:07:04.540
There is some blood pooled around the heart.

910
01:07:09.578 --> 01:07:11.547
- Check his blood pressure again. - Yes.

911
01:07:14.116 --> 01:07:15.284
Yes.

912
01:07:15.818 --> 01:07:18.788
Yeon Kyung, Mr. Choi was taken to the police station.

913
01:07:20.222 --> 01:07:21.324
What?

914
01:07:21.324 --> 01:07:25.361
I clearly saw him doing it properly.

915
01:07:25.361 --> 01:07:27.463
Why do you not trust me?

916
01:07:27.463 --> 01:07:30.700
I usually trust what people say.

917
01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:33.135
But you are contradicting each other.

918
01:07:33.135 --> 01:07:35.271
How can I only trust one side?

919
01:07:37.206 --> 01:07:40.176
Master Choi did not put that needle.

920
01:07:40.409 --> 01:07:42.745
He is not someone who makes mistakes like that.

921
01:07:42.745 --> 01:07:44.280
His hands are shaky.

922
01:07:45.648 --> 01:07:47.516
I saw his hands shake when he applied acupuncture.

923
01:07:52.121 --> 01:07:54.023
They took Mr. Choi.

924
01:07:54.056 --> 01:07:56.926
They said he pierced a patient's heart while applying acupuncture.

925
01:07:57.259 --> 01:07:59.195
What is wrong with this patient?

926
01:07:59.528 --> 01:08:01.530
Wake up.

927
01:08:02.665 --> 01:08:05.634
What will happen to him if something bad happens to that patient?

928
01:08:40.603 --> 01:08:43.239
(Live Up To Your Name, Dr. Heo)

929
01:08:43.639 --> 01:08:45.107
I'm okay.

930
01:08:45.174 --> 01:08:48.177
Nothing should weaken you.

931
01:08:48.177 --> 01:08:49.745
I will save Master Choi.

932
01:08:49.745 --> 01:08:52.014
Who is he to do all of this?

933
01:08:52.014 --> 01:08:54.950
I will not look for you anymore if you do that task.

934
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.719
He went to do a dangerous task.

935
01:08:56.986 --> 01:08:58.053
I need to stop him.

936
01:08:58.554 --> 01:08:59.855
It's okay now.

937
01:09:00.723 --> 01:09:02.024
Everything is okay.

938
01:09:02.024 --> 01:09:04.026
Is there something you can do right now?

939
01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.529
You should go back.

940
01:09:06.695 --> 01:09:08.264
Can't you think about it again?

941
01:09:08.297 --> 01:09:11.567
Do not worry. I will return soon.
