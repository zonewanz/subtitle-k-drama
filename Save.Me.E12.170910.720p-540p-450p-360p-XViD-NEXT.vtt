00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:23.174
(Episode 12)

7
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:31.015
Mom.

8
00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:34.452
Is it you, Sang Jin?

9
00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:37.055
Sang Jin!

10
00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:41.693
Where do you think you're going? Let's have some fun.

11
00:00:42.393 --> 00:00:46.130
Don't you know that you'll never be able to get out of here?

12
00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:49.701
Sang Jin! Sang Jin.

13
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:51.602
- Help me, Sang Jin! - Mom!

14
00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:52.603
Sang Jin.

15
00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:54.906
You need to get out of here for Sang Mi to live,

16
00:00:55.173 --> 00:00:56.474
so please...

17
00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.010
Please save Sang Mi.

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.984
Sang Mi!

19
00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:40.685
No, Sang Mi.

20
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.888
Is it you, Sang Mi?

21
00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:47.325
Sang Mi, get out of here now. Sang Mi...

22
00:01:50.094 --> 00:01:51.329
You are...

23
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.332
Don't come closer.

24
00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.403
Where is Sang Mi?

25
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.105
It looks like the drugs have worn off.

26
00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:05.209
What kind of drugs...

27
00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:08.279
have you been dosing me up with?

28
00:02:11.282 --> 00:02:14.519
The drug that will allow you to stay in the paradise forever.

29
00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.891
Here, let's go back inside now.

30
00:02:22.927 --> 00:02:24.429
What are you...

31
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.832
trying to do to Sang Mi?

32
00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:30.435
What do you mean?

33
00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:33.971
We're just trying to help Sang Mi get on the Boat of Salvation first.

34
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:36.407
Do you know how blessed she is to be in that position?

35
00:02:38.142 --> 00:02:39.777
Why on earth...

36
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:43.414
are you doing this to us? Why?

37
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.585
You still don't see it.

38
00:02:48.653 --> 00:02:52.089
I have to make Sang Mi our Spiritual Mother...

39
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:55.860
so that my daughter and I can reach the paradise.

40
00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:04.969
Sang Mi.

41
00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:07.238
Sang Mi, run...

42
00:03:09.173 --> 00:03:10.341
Sang Mi.

43
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:13.277
Run... Run away.

44
00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:17.381
Sang Mi...

45
00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.819
- Is it for yourself? - I want to give it to my mom.

46
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.922
Oh, it's for your mom.

47
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.258
My mom...

48
00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:05.196
has never been outside of that place for three years.

49
00:04:10.034 --> 00:04:12.303
She has always liked butterflies.

50
00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:26.984
Do you know what this is?

51
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.988
People normally call it elephant injection.

52
00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:34.659
It's a tranquilizer that can even knock down an elephant...

53
00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:36.794
with just one shot.

54
00:04:49.607 --> 00:04:50.975
Don't worry.

55
00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:53.277
I won't inject too much of it.

56
00:05:24.742 --> 00:05:26.177
Sang Jin...

57
00:05:30.615 --> 00:05:31.782
That's right.

58
00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:33.851
Get some rest.

59
00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:37.355
You're in the paradise now.

60
00:06:02.346 --> 00:06:03.414
Mom!

61
00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.225
What are you doing to my mom?

62
00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:16.327
Can't you see?

63
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:18.496
Your mother's condition...

64
00:06:18.496 --> 00:06:21.365
has gotten worse because of you.

65
00:06:21.866 --> 00:06:25.936
Because you're not taking the training faithfully,

66
00:06:26.237 --> 00:06:28.506
the evil has gone inside your mother's body...

67
00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:30.875
to disturb your mind.

68
00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.910
If you want her to be healthy,

69
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.814
you have to take the training with all your heart.

70
00:06:38.816 --> 00:06:40.484
Stop talking nonsense...

71
00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:41.686
If you don't,

72
00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:44.255
we will perform an exorcism on her. Would you like that?

73
00:07:09.914 --> 00:07:11.215
I am...

74
00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:15.886
sorry, Apostle Kang.

75
00:07:18.956 --> 00:07:20.558
What are you sorry for?

76
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:22.193
Everything.

77
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:25.029
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:30.301
I really am sorry for everything.

79
00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:32.670
So please...

80
00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:35.906
let my mom go.

81
00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:39.643
You know that...

82
00:07:39.643 --> 00:07:43.614
I want her to be happy more than anyone in this place.

83
00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:47.585
So trust me, okay?

84
00:07:50.087 --> 00:07:51.355
Okay.

85
00:07:52.323 --> 00:07:53.991
I'll trust you.

86
00:07:54.658 --> 00:07:57.061
I trust you, Apostle Kang.

87
00:07:59.663 --> 00:08:00.698
All right.

88
00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.968
Shall we go back to the prayer room now?

89
00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:06.203
Please wait.

90
00:08:08.105 --> 00:08:10.174
I'd like to stay with my mom just for a little.

91
00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:14.378
Please, Apostle Kang.

92
00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:19.850
I'll wait for you outside.

93
00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:03.494
Mom.

94
00:09:04.795 --> 00:09:06.664
Hang in there a little longer.

95
00:09:08.265 --> 00:09:09.466
Just a little longer.

96
00:09:10.901 --> 00:09:12.903
Please hang in there a little longer.

97
00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:15.339
Okay?

98
00:09:16.574 --> 00:09:18.309
Don't you ever give up.

99
00:09:57.314 --> 00:09:58.682
So Rin,

100
00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:01.619
you shouldn't let Sang Mi go around by herself.

101
00:10:02.353 --> 00:10:03.854
Take better care of her.

102
00:10:04.388 --> 00:10:05.389
Okay.

103
00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:16.367
(Guseonwon)

104
00:10:22.172 --> 00:10:26.677
It looks like things are a little different from yesterday.

105
00:10:28.012 --> 00:10:30.381
We're having an exorcism service today.

106
00:10:31.115 --> 00:10:32.249
An exorcism service?

107
00:10:32.416 --> 00:10:34.652
Yes. You might not know this,

108
00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:38.989
but we're having spiritual battles with the evil every day.

109
00:10:41.158 --> 00:10:44.128
Illnesses, misfortunes,

110
00:10:44.128 --> 00:10:46.096
and accidents happen...

111
00:10:46.096 --> 00:10:48.966
because our souls are captured by the evil.

112
00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:57.174
Now, apostles, please help her come forward.

113
00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:05.149
Please be careful.

114
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.394
She's possessed by the evil.

115
00:11:17.394 --> 00:11:18.495
Who are you?

116
00:11:21.065 --> 00:11:22.499
I'm her father-in-law.

117
00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:26.003
She is a child of Almighty. How did you get inside of her?

118
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:30.074
I got inside of her when her faith was weakened.

119
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.980
Go away! Go away now, and take her sickness with you!

120
00:11:36.914 --> 00:11:38.182
I won't.

121
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.752
I will kill everyone.

122
00:11:44.555 --> 00:11:47.791
Almighty saved her life, didn't he?

123
00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:49.827
So why would I go?

124
00:11:57.568 --> 00:11:59.036
You caught me.

125
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.740
I just need to stay inside of her a little longer.

126
00:12:05.342 --> 00:12:06.944
You evil soul!

127
00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:09.980
Here, I curse you.

128
00:12:10.114 --> 00:12:13.450
Go away with her bad sickness at once!

129
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.461
My goodness.

130
00:12:27.364 --> 00:12:29.066
- Oh, gosh. - Goodness.

131
00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:31.502
- She's alive. - She's getting up.

132
00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:36.206
Spiritual Father. I'm no longer in pain.

133
00:12:36.373 --> 00:12:37.808
I don't feel any pain.

134
00:12:39.877 --> 00:12:43.380
Power, miracles, salvation, and eternal life.

135
00:12:43.547 --> 00:12:46.350
I shall give all of these...

136
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.220
to those who believe in me!

137
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.322
- Our wishes will be fulfilled! - Our wishes will be fulfilled!

138
00:12:52.423 --> 00:12:54.491
- I believe it! - I believe it!

139
00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.430
They're crazy.

140
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.365
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

141
00:13:03.233 --> 00:13:04.435
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

142
00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:06.203
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

143
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.008
How was today's service?

144
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.645
It was amazing. I didn't think ghosts exist.

145
00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:17.915
You can believe it now that you've seen it, right?

146
00:13:18.749 --> 00:13:20.050
See?

147
00:13:20.084 --> 00:13:22.586
Guseonwon is different from other churches.

148
00:13:22.586 --> 00:13:25.022
You can see everything here.

149
00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:28.926
We're totally different from churches that tell you to believe...

150
00:13:28.926 --> 00:13:30.494
something you can't even see.

151
00:13:31.929 --> 00:13:32.963
By the way...

152
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.332
Yes? Is there something you want to ask?

153
00:13:35.766 --> 00:13:38.869
When will we get to meet Spiritual Father?

154
00:13:41.705 --> 00:13:45.109
You must've been very impressed by our Spiritual Father today.

155
00:13:47.177 --> 00:13:49.780
If you want to see our Spiritual Father in person,

156
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.349
you need to receive the basic training process as a believer.

157
00:13:53.183 --> 00:13:55.219
Can't we just meet him right now?

158
00:13:56.386 --> 00:13:57.588
Dong Cheol.

159
00:13:58.288 --> 00:13:59.690
Do you want to lose your eyesight?

160
00:14:00.124 --> 00:14:03.627
- Pardon? - He's a very special being.

161
00:14:03.627 --> 00:14:07.097
If people like you who are spiritually weak meet him up close,

162
00:14:07.297 --> 00:14:10.634
you might end up losing your eyesight...

163
00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:13.203
because of the strong energy he lets out.

164
00:14:13.971 --> 00:14:16.106
Then what do we need to do?

165
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.542
You need to live here...

166
00:14:18.542 --> 00:14:21.678
and receive the basic training process for three weeks.

167
00:14:21.812 --> 00:14:23.080
We need to live here?

168
00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:27.217
That's how you'll be able to cleanse your body and soul.

169
00:14:29.386 --> 00:14:33.090
Do we need to pay money while we receive training?

170
00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:38.028
You'll be sleeping, eating, and receiving training for free.

171
00:14:38.095 --> 00:14:41.431
However, you need to make an offering to our Almighty later on...

172
00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:43.967
for the entry and completion of your training process.

173
00:14:45.936 --> 00:14:47.070
How much is that?

174
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.306
It's not that expensive. It costs 1,000 dollars each.

175
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.275
2,000 dollars?

176
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.944
2,000 dollars?

177
00:14:55.245 --> 00:14:56.346
Everyone.

178
00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:59.850
Will you choose to have eternal life in paradise...

179
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.352
by receiving training for three weeks?

180
00:15:02.352 --> 00:15:05.489
Or will you choose to live in eternal pain in the fiery pit...

181
00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:08.192
just by saving 2,000 dollars?

182
00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:12.296
Shall we go to the seminar room now? Let's go.

183
00:15:12.296 --> 00:15:13.363
Wait.

184
00:15:14.264 --> 00:15:16.567
Yes? Do you have another question?

185
00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:19.036
I need to go to the bathroom.

186
00:15:19.203 --> 00:15:21.838
Oh, I see. Yes, you should go.

187
00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:25.008
You can come to the seminar room after you're done.

188
00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:26.076
Okay.

189
00:16:14.258 --> 00:16:16.660
(Individual Prayer Room)

190
00:16:19.162 --> 00:16:20.497
Sang Mi told you not to worry.

191
00:16:20.497 --> 00:16:22.499
She's in the individual prayer room, so you can't meet her yet.

192
00:16:22.499 --> 00:16:24.001
But you'll be able to meet her soon.

193
00:16:37.147 --> 00:16:38.782
(Individual Prayer Room)

194
00:16:50.227 --> 00:16:51.662
What are you doing there?

195
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.765
What are you doing there?

196
00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:58.702
I heard a weird sound coming from this room...

197
00:16:58.702 --> 00:17:00.437
after I came out of the bathroom.

198
00:17:11.848 --> 00:17:13.617
It's not a weird sound.

199
00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:17.888
It's the sound of our believers crying in pain...

200
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:20.057
from deep down within their hearts.

201
00:17:21.558 --> 00:17:23.760
Oh, I see.

202
00:17:25.595 --> 00:17:27.230
The world...

203
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:31.435
does not listen to those people in pain these days.

204
00:17:32.369 --> 00:17:36.340
They only listen to those who are rich and powerful.

205
00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:43.313
However, it seems like you have a lot of anger and despair...

206
00:17:44.047 --> 00:17:47.584
deep down in your heart.

207
00:17:48.652 --> 00:17:52.556
You carried all that burden to finally come here.

208
00:17:53.924 --> 00:17:57.661
I can only imagine how painful and torturous it must've been.

209
00:18:09.206 --> 00:18:10.874
It's burning hot.

210
00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:14.845
If you keep neglecting all the resentment and sorrow in your heart,

211
00:18:17.314 --> 00:18:18.849
you'll end up burning yourself...

212
00:18:19.483 --> 00:18:22.753
as well as everything around you.

213
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.155
So now, you should...

214
00:18:25.956 --> 00:18:28.525
surrender everything to Almighty.

215
00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:33.263
That's the only way you'll be able to free your soul.

216
00:18:45.609 --> 00:18:46.910
What do I need to do?

217
00:18:48.945 --> 00:18:50.247
What should I do...

218
00:18:51.281 --> 00:18:53.450
to surrender my everything to Almighty?

219
00:18:59.356 --> 00:19:01.291
Pray to Almighty.

220
00:19:01.691 --> 00:19:04.161
After all, this is where people pray.

221
00:19:05.495 --> 00:19:09.032
However, this place is not open to all believers.

222
00:19:09.766 --> 00:19:12.369
So you should leave with me today.

223
00:19:14.271 --> 00:19:15.305
Okay.

224
00:19:17.908 --> 00:19:20.277
I want you to catch those jerks.

225
00:19:20.877 --> 00:19:23.713
You know I can't just let go of things, right?

226
00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:29.486
Welcome.

227
00:19:47.871 --> 00:19:49.806
What... What was that?

228
00:19:49.806 --> 00:19:51.541
Was that a bear or human?

229
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:55.011
Keep your promise, and restart the citizens' long-desired business.

230
00:19:55.011 --> 00:19:56.947
- Keep your promise! - Keep your promise!

231
00:19:56.947 --> 00:19:58.882
Don't disturb Muji's development.

232
00:19:58.882 --> 00:20:00.884
- Don't disturb Muji's development. - Yes, okay.

233
00:20:00.951 --> 00:20:04.488
- Keep your promise! - There are more protesters now.

234
00:20:04.488 --> 00:20:06.223
- Keep your promise! - Keep your promise!

235
00:20:06.223 --> 00:20:08.859
- Don't disturb Muji's development. - The press have gathered too.

236
00:20:08.859 --> 00:20:11.094
- Don't disturb Muji's development. - Don't disturb Muji's development.

237
00:20:11.094 --> 00:20:14.164
The governor of Muji should keep his promise!

238
00:20:16.766 --> 00:20:19.636
Are they still protesting?

239
00:20:20.437 --> 00:20:23.173
More and more people are taking part in the protest.

240
00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:27.077
The press also seems to be taking the other party's side now.

241
00:20:29.179 --> 00:20:30.714
Things are going as Mr. Cheon planned.

242
00:20:30.714 --> 00:20:33.450
People are going against you for no good reason.

243
00:20:33.717 --> 00:20:35.852
You can't just continue to do nothing and watch them from afar.

244
00:20:39.222 --> 00:20:40.924
There's a way you can get rid of Mr. Cheon,

245
00:20:40.924 --> 00:20:44.828
and make the terminal business into your own achievement.

246
00:20:46.062 --> 00:20:47.831
You should hold hands with Baek Jung Ki.

247
00:20:49.032 --> 00:20:50.634
I've looked into Guseonwon's offer,

248
00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:53.003
and it's pretty appealing.

249
00:20:53.637 --> 00:20:56.239
It's also something our citizens have been wanting for a long time.

250
00:20:57.574 --> 00:21:00.076
A general hospital with a sanitarium?

251
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.811
If we shorten the construction process...

252
00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:04.314
and successfully build it within your term,

253
00:21:04.314 --> 00:21:06.416
it'll work positively for you during the next election.

254
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.954
And if you succeed in using Baek Jung Ki wisely,

255
00:21:10.954 --> 00:21:12.956
you'll also be able to move Senator Park.

256
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.591
Really?

257
00:21:16.793 --> 00:21:17.827
Ji Hee.

258
00:21:18.728 --> 00:21:21.831
Then why don't you fix a schedule?

259
00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:24.367
I should go and see for myself...

260
00:21:25.435 --> 00:21:27.437
what kind of place Guseonwon is.

261
00:21:31.174 --> 00:21:32.175
Okay.

262
00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:48.658
Flowers tend to wither when their lives end.

263
00:21:51.328 --> 00:21:53.964
But you are very tenacious of life.

264
00:21:55.065 --> 00:21:57.033
Do you know why I take care of you?

265
00:21:58.168 --> 00:22:00.170
It's because you're a flower to me.

266
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.939
You're a flower that I can show off to others.

267
00:22:10.347 --> 00:22:12.582
You're still worth the use.

268
00:22:13.617 --> 00:22:16.886
So please stay dead like this until I'm done using you.

269
00:22:17.354 --> 00:22:19.089
I'll come visit you every day...

270
00:22:20.123 --> 00:22:21.324
to water you.

271
00:22:37.474 --> 00:22:38.642
What's going on?

272
00:22:43.413 --> 00:22:46.549
Apostle Kang gave my mom an injection.

273
00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:49.886
- What? - I'm sure of it.

274
00:22:50.387 --> 00:22:53.423
I saw her hiding the syringe that was in her hand.

275
00:22:54.824 --> 00:22:58.094
Okay, I'll look into what that could've been.

276
00:22:58.695 --> 00:23:00.463
And I think...

277
00:23:02.666 --> 00:23:05.602
It's okay. Please tell me.

278
00:23:09.172 --> 00:23:10.373
I think...

279
00:23:13.243 --> 00:23:16.780
your mother's condition got worse because of her medicine.

280
00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:21.518
What kind of medicine did she take?

281
00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:24.487
I'm still looking into it.

282
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:26.823
But I think it was a psychotropic drug.

283
00:23:26.956 --> 00:23:30.360
It's just a guess, but it could've been given to other people as well.

284
00:23:30.694 --> 00:23:33.930
If we confirm that they injected unidentified medicine illegally,

285
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.465
they will be subject to legal punishment.

286
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.338
Legal punishment?

287
00:23:44.474 --> 00:23:46.509
I'll try asking my friends for help.

288
00:23:46.876 --> 00:23:49.045
It'll be quicker if we all look for evidence together.

289
00:23:49.212 --> 00:23:51.548
Please help me get in touch with Dong Cheol.

290
00:23:52.015 --> 00:23:56.052
Okay. It might be easier for him to look around since he's a newcomer.

291
00:23:56.453 --> 00:24:00.056
However, a lot of believers have their eyes on us.

292
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.167
Evidence? Do I need to look for forged medical prescriptions...

293
00:24:11.167 --> 00:24:13.036
or strange drugs?

294
00:24:13.036 --> 00:24:16.706
Drug ledgers and medical charts will help too.

295
00:24:16.806 --> 00:24:19.776
It's a special kind of drug, so it'll be hidden somewhere.

296
00:24:19.776 --> 00:24:22.178
They're not red pills or clear liquid.

297
00:24:22.345 --> 00:24:25.448
Please look for a container with milk-like liquid.

298
00:24:26.616 --> 00:24:27.817
Milk-like liquid?

299
00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.512
She said they're not red pills.

300
00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:40.223
Where were you? I couldn't even find you in the prayer room.

301
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.127
I couldn't concentrate, so I took a look around.

302
00:25:44.994 --> 00:25:48.865
It must've cost a lot of money to build such a huge building...

303
00:25:49.065 --> 00:25:51.167
in the mountain.

304
00:25:52.802 --> 00:25:54.103
How much did it cost?

305
00:25:56.439 --> 00:25:57.841
My gosh.

306
00:25:59.142 --> 00:26:01.978
You sometimes seem very odd.

307
00:26:02.612 --> 00:26:05.615
Don't think about useless things. Just focus on receiving salvation.

308
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:07.650
- My goodness. - Okay.

309
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:11.054
- Get in. You need to go back. - Okay.

310
00:26:28.371 --> 00:26:30.640
- Dong Cheol. - Yes.

311
00:26:51.561 --> 00:26:52.695
Where are you?

312
00:27:12.448 --> 00:27:13.616
Aren't you hot?

313
00:27:15.018 --> 00:27:17.053
It's cold because there are air conditioners everywhere I go.

314
00:27:18.388 --> 00:27:20.456
It's not good to be around air conditioners for too long.

315
00:27:22.325 --> 00:27:24.227
Cold drinks aren't good for your body.

316
00:27:25.295 --> 00:27:27.764
You always had weak intestines.

317
00:27:30.066 --> 00:27:32.035
This is why it's great to have friends.

318
00:27:32.502 --> 00:27:33.970
Friends know everything about you.

319
00:27:35.939 --> 00:27:37.473
You don't need to sit down.

320
00:27:45.882 --> 00:27:47.483
I guess you're still quite dumb.

321
00:27:53.823 --> 00:27:54.991
There are rumors saying that...

322
00:27:55.858 --> 00:27:58.261
you're working for a policeman.

323
00:27:59.062 --> 00:28:02.332
I can't believe you're working for the police now.

324
00:28:02.565 --> 00:28:03.666
I'm surprised.

325
00:28:05.668 --> 00:28:08.638
The world we live in revolves around money.

326
00:28:10.073 --> 00:28:11.074
Then...

327
00:28:12.075 --> 00:28:14.477
shouldn't you work for someone who's stronger than...

328
00:28:14.477 --> 00:28:15.678
that policeman?

329
00:28:19.115 --> 00:28:23.219
I'll put in a good word for you to my boss.

330
00:28:23.886 --> 00:28:25.188
So let's work together.

331
00:28:25.421 --> 00:28:27.623
Let's forget about the past.

332
00:28:28.191 --> 00:28:29.425
We're...

333
00:28:29.792 --> 00:28:31.094
over 40 now.

334
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:35.298
That policeman and my boss...

335
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:37.600
are fighting for their own goods.

336
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.069
But that doesn't mean we have to fight each other as well.

337
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:44.273
Let's just earn our share of money from their fights.

338
00:28:54.584 --> 00:28:55.651
Hey.

339
00:28:56.719 --> 00:28:57.787
From now on,

340
00:28:58.588 --> 00:29:00.923
I'll give you 30 percent of what I earn from the club.

341
00:29:03.426 --> 00:29:05.695
Let's work together like old times...

342
00:29:05.962 --> 00:29:08.698
and take over Muji.

343
00:29:12.468 --> 00:29:13.836
What does a human being mean to you?

344
00:29:16.105 --> 00:29:19.275
- What? - Do you think of humans as objects?

345
00:29:19.475 --> 00:29:22.011
You're trying to get me on your side by saying what I want to hear.

346
00:29:22.011 --> 00:29:24.080
But are you going to abandon me again when you don't need me?

347
00:29:26.049 --> 00:29:29.085
What happened to you in prison?

348
00:29:29.385 --> 00:29:30.753
Why have you become so complicated?

349
00:29:32.622 --> 00:29:33.689
Do you know why...

350
00:29:34.023 --> 00:29:35.992
I haven't killed you yet?

351
00:29:37.226 --> 00:29:39.529
Why? Tell me.

352
00:29:40.229 --> 00:29:41.531
I'm trying to make you nervous.

353
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.134
So...

354
00:29:45.968 --> 00:29:47.804
you should start going to church.

355
00:29:51.407 --> 00:29:52.475
You should at least...

356
00:29:54.043 --> 00:29:55.878
go to paradise when you die.

357
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.594
I met...

358
00:30:12.562 --> 00:30:13.930
the cult leader today.

359
00:30:16.699 --> 00:30:17.733
Really?

360
00:30:19.702 --> 00:30:20.736
What happened?

361
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.406
When his hand touched my body,

362
00:30:24.674 --> 00:30:28.945
I seriously couldn't move an inch.

363
00:30:30.113 --> 00:30:31.280
I met...

364
00:30:31.781 --> 00:30:35.184
so many monsters in prison.

365
00:30:36.219 --> 00:30:38.788
But I've never met anyone like him.

366
00:30:39.188 --> 00:30:41.290
I couldn't feel any kinds of emotion in him.

367
00:30:41.657 --> 00:30:43.259
So I couldn't figure out...

368
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.862
what he was thinking...

369
00:30:46.929 --> 00:30:48.364
or what he was feeling.

370
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:50.266
Yes.

371
00:30:51.067 --> 00:30:53.703
When I also sneaked into his room,

372
00:30:53.903 --> 00:30:55.705
I could sense that...

373
00:30:56.472 --> 00:30:58.341
he was beyond insane judging by his actions.

374
00:31:00.943 --> 00:31:02.078
Sang Hwan.

375
00:31:03.412 --> 00:31:06.883
When I saw the look in that cult leader's eyes,

376
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.951
this is what came to my mind.

377
00:31:09.719 --> 00:31:14.323
I thought I was the only one who had to suffer in prison for three years.

378
00:31:16.092 --> 00:31:17.293
But I realized that...

379
00:31:18.394 --> 00:31:20.696
Sang Mi had been living in prison too.

380
00:31:25.835 --> 00:31:27.270
The same goes for you as well.

381
00:31:30.173 --> 00:31:31.374
So...

382
00:31:32.308 --> 00:31:34.310
it's now time for you and Sang Mi...

383
00:31:35.211 --> 00:31:37.480
to get out of that prison.

384
00:32:20.323 --> 00:32:24.060
We never know when Almighty might come to save us.

385
00:32:24.227 --> 00:32:27.997
So we always need to stay as a pure virgin with an awakened soul.

386
00:32:28.164 --> 00:32:29.565
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

387
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.568
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

388
00:32:32.935 --> 00:32:37.173
Hence, this early morning time is very important to us.

389
00:32:37.707 --> 00:32:40.676
When others are foolishly asleep,

390
00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:45.314
we must stay awake to prepare for the day Almighty will be here.

391
00:32:47.683 --> 00:32:48.851
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

392
00:32:49.085 --> 00:32:51.554
From now on, you should come here every day at this hour...

393
00:32:51.554 --> 00:32:53.322
and pray earnestly.

394
00:32:53.456 --> 00:32:54.590
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

395
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:59.528
I'm sure that Almighty will gift you with an astonishing revelation.

396
00:32:59.662 --> 00:33:02.031
Our wishes will be fulfilled. I believe it.

397
00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:04.967
Good.

398
00:33:05.468 --> 00:33:09.305
Go in, and begin your prayer with all of your heart.

399
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.409
Okay, Apostle Kang.

400
00:33:29.158 --> 00:33:30.326
Hello.

401
00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.062
This is the one who found the body.

402
00:33:33.062 --> 00:33:36.065
He's Park Seung Man, and he runs a health food store downtown.

403
00:33:36.065 --> 00:33:40.169
He has superb eyesight, which helps him find ginseng.

404
00:33:40.169 --> 00:33:42.371
Who knew he'd find a dead body too?

405
00:33:42.505 --> 00:33:43.806
- Hey. - Yes, sir.

406
00:33:43.873 --> 00:33:45.541
- Get his statement. - Sure.

407
00:33:45.541 --> 00:33:47.476
Sir, please come with me.

408
00:33:50.246 --> 00:33:52.114
Did you guys find anything on the scene?

409
00:33:52.114 --> 00:33:55.051
Oh, we found a wallet right beside the body.

410
00:33:55.051 --> 00:33:56.485
There was a social security card inside.

411
00:33:56.485 --> 00:33:58.354
Officer Choi, show it to him.

412
00:33:58.354 --> 00:33:59.655
Here you go, sir.

413
00:34:02.425 --> 00:34:03.693
(Kim Hae Eun)

414
00:34:07.096 --> 00:34:10.499
(Kim Hae Eun, age 18, religion, ran away from home)

415
00:34:12.902 --> 00:34:15.638
Please find my granddaughter.

416
00:34:15.805 --> 00:34:18.974
I'll look into it and be in touch with you.

417
00:34:21.243 --> 00:34:22.311
What's the matter?

418
00:34:22.311 --> 00:34:23.346
Sorry?

419
00:34:24.313 --> 00:34:25.915
It's nothing. Never mind.

420
00:34:36.592 --> 00:34:37.660
Hey.

421
00:34:38.427 --> 00:34:40.129
What's that building over there?

422
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:43.199
Oh, it's Guseonwon.

423
00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:47.570
- Guseonwon? - Yes.

424
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.139
They locked her up because they want her to marry the cult leader.

425
00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:52.074
We wouldn't have come here if we could talk to them!

426
00:34:52.074 --> 00:34:54.110
- Detective Kim, take this guy. - Yes, sir.

427
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.845
Stop, please!

428
00:34:56.045 --> 00:34:57.513
I'll go back.

429
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.250
I'll go back to Guseonwon, so please let them go.

430
00:35:24.707 --> 00:35:32.081
(Guseonwon)

431
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.529
Excuse me. What is that?

432
00:35:48.764 --> 00:35:51.000
- Living Water. - Living Water?

433
00:35:52.468 --> 00:35:55.604
Even those who are bedridden with a terminal illness...

434
00:35:55.604 --> 00:35:58.340
get up and laugh when they drink this water.

435
00:35:58.541 --> 00:36:02.478
- Just drinking this isn't enough. - Right.

436
00:36:02.478 --> 00:36:04.914
You have to have faith in it.

437
00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:07.016
Yes, absolutely.

438
00:36:07.149 --> 00:36:09.318
By the way, why is the color of your lid gold?

439
00:36:09.318 --> 00:36:15.191
This is special Living Water blessed by Spiritual Father's face.

440
00:36:15.191 --> 00:36:16.459
Blessed by his face?

441
00:36:16.459 --> 00:36:19.662
Spiritual Father washed his face with this water.

442
00:36:20.696 --> 00:36:22.698
And you sprinkle it on your food?

443
00:36:23.899 --> 00:36:26.502
I guess you don't know these things because you're new.

444
00:36:26.502 --> 00:36:29.104
It's considered the most precious Living Water.

445
00:36:29.405 --> 00:36:31.640
It's priceless.

446
00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:35.044
Then what's yours?

447
00:36:35.344 --> 00:36:39.281
Spiritual Father washed his feet with this water.

448
00:36:39.615 --> 00:36:42.952
Water that touched his body and received his blessings...

449
00:36:42.952 --> 00:36:44.420
is the most precious water of all.

450
00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.454
Absolutely.

451
00:36:46.422 --> 00:36:49.425
Well, I'm not saying that we can't punish them.

452
00:36:49.425 --> 00:36:53.128
Cornering them won't do you any good because they'll take action.

453
00:36:53.128 --> 00:36:54.497
Chief.

454
00:36:54.497 --> 00:36:56.999
Those jerks abducted my daughter.

455
00:36:56.999 --> 00:36:59.535
They'll take action? What does that even mean?

456
00:36:59.535 --> 00:37:02.171
Your daughter stated that she wanted them to take her,

457
00:37:02.171 --> 00:37:04.039
so it can't be considered an abduction.

458
00:37:04.039 --> 00:37:05.174
Also,

459
00:37:05.941 --> 00:37:07.643
it looked like those guys got assaulted.

460
00:37:08.177 --> 00:37:11.413
That I can explain. We were on our way to a morning service,

461
00:37:11.413 --> 00:37:13.048
and they blocked our car out of the blue.

462
00:37:13.048 --> 00:37:15.518
Then they tried to take Sang Mi from us forcibly,

463
00:37:15.518 --> 00:37:17.186
so we punched them a few times to try to stop them.

464
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:22.725
There's one more thing.

465
00:37:22.725 --> 00:37:25.828
We heard that she was locked up here.

466
00:37:25.828 --> 00:37:27.329
What are you talking about?

467
00:37:27.329 --> 00:37:30.699
Detective, you're out of line.

468
00:37:30.766 --> 00:37:34.169
We never locked up anyone. Everyone here came here at their own will.

469
00:37:34.236 --> 00:37:37.540
They're here to cure their souls. You're calling it confinement...

470
00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.776
because you don't understand our religion, and it's very rude.

471
00:37:43.279 --> 00:37:46.248
Right, I do apologize.

472
00:37:46.715 --> 00:37:50.252
But there are a few things I'd like to check.

473
00:37:50.252 --> 00:37:52.221
Would I be able to meet the pastor here?

474
00:37:52.221 --> 00:37:56.025
We call him Spiritual Father, not "pastor".

475
00:37:56.025 --> 00:37:57.026
Pardon me?

476
00:37:58.327 --> 00:37:59.695
Isn't this a church?

477
00:38:00.095 --> 00:38:01.430
I see a cross there too.

478
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:04.233
This place is different from the churches...

479
00:38:04.233 --> 00:38:06.035
that you know of.

480
00:38:06.035 --> 00:38:08.504
Other churches are all fake.

481
00:38:08.504 --> 00:38:10.139
Only we worship the truth.

482
00:38:10.172 --> 00:38:11.206
I see.

483
00:38:12.107 --> 00:38:13.409
Then may I meet your pastor...

484
00:38:15.711 --> 00:38:18.213
I mean, would I be able to meet Spiritual Father for a quick talk?

485
00:38:18.213 --> 00:38:21.216
Chief, you're so clueless.

486
00:38:21.317 --> 00:38:24.486
Lowlifes can't have the honor to meet him...

487
00:38:24.486 --> 00:38:27.022
even if they want to.

488
00:38:28.357 --> 00:38:31.594
What did you say? Look, Mister.

489
00:38:31.594 --> 00:38:32.995
Did you just call me a lowlife?

490
00:38:32.995 --> 00:38:36.599
Please don't cause a scene here. Let's talk in my office.

491
00:38:37.266 --> 00:38:39.301
You came to Almighty's sanctuary,

492
00:38:39.301 --> 00:38:42.905
so I should at least bring out some tea for you. That's true love.

493
00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.079
I'm Chief Lee Kang Su from the Serious Crimes Unit.

494
00:38:50.412 --> 00:38:52.715
As you know, there was the abduction case,

495
00:38:52.715 --> 00:38:54.950
and something else broke out around here yesterday,

496
00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:56.385
so I'd like to ask you a few questions.

497
00:38:57.186 --> 00:38:58.454
Sure, please go ahead.

498
00:38:58.821 --> 00:39:01.090
About that girl, Sang Mi...

499
00:39:01.256 --> 00:39:04.426
Have you ever demanded sexual relations from her?

500
00:39:06.128 --> 00:39:07.796
Of course not.

501
00:39:07.863 --> 00:39:11.967
According to her, she was told that she has to marry you.

502
00:39:12.368 --> 00:39:15.971
When Almighty's world is strictly seen from the worldly point of view,

503
00:39:16.372 --> 00:39:19.074
such misunderstandings can certainly arise.

504
00:39:19.508 --> 00:39:20.542
Pardon me?

505
00:39:21.543 --> 00:39:23.812
The spiritual wedding is...

506
00:39:23.812 --> 00:39:26.915
a wedding in a symbolic sense where 2 souls become 1.

507
00:39:26.915 --> 00:39:30.052
It's a ritual that aims to achieve a spiritual cohesion.

508
00:39:30.152 --> 00:39:31.920
Well, what I'm trying to say is...

509
00:39:32.521 --> 00:39:36.058
I'm not here to talk about your religious doctrine.

510
00:39:36.058 --> 00:39:39.328
Does your so-called "spiritual wedding" involve...

511
00:39:39.395 --> 00:39:42.297
any sexual aspect? That was my question.

512
00:39:44.166 --> 00:39:49.204
You keep approaching it in the worldly point of view.

513
00:39:49.204 --> 00:39:51.874
Gosh, you're at it again. You're making it sound so complicated.

514
00:39:51.874 --> 00:39:55.344
Chief, I'm her father.

515
00:39:55.344 --> 00:39:59.181
What father will force his daughter to have sexual relations?

516
00:39:59.181 --> 00:40:01.917
No parents in their right mind would do such a thing.

517
00:40:02.951 --> 00:40:06.689
I don't think you're understanding my question clearly.

518
00:40:06.689 --> 00:40:09.958
What I'm asking is if the spiritual wedding...

519
00:40:09.958 --> 00:40:13.362
You said it's a ritual where two souls seek a spiritual cohesion.

520
00:40:13.362 --> 00:40:16.765
I'm asking if having sexual relations is a mandatory part of it.

521
00:40:17.199 --> 00:40:20.502
Chief, it doesn't look like you want to believe...

522
00:40:20.502 --> 00:40:22.404
what we're telling you.

523
00:40:24.306 --> 00:40:25.674
Apostle Kang.

524
00:40:25.808 --> 00:40:27.910
Yes, she'll be here shortly.

525
00:40:30.479 --> 00:40:33.916
You should ask her directly.

526
00:40:47.563 --> 00:40:51.467
Your dad, Sipritual Father, and these apostles are saying...

527
00:40:51.633 --> 00:40:55.037
that you were never confined or coerced in any way. Is it true?

528
00:40:55.904 --> 00:40:57.272
Don't worry, and tell me honestly.

529
00:40:59.308 --> 00:41:02.111
Yes, such things never happened.

530
00:41:02.945 --> 00:41:06.548
This isn't the kind of place you think it is.

531
00:41:06.849 --> 00:41:09.218
- Last time I saw you, you said... - That day, I was a bit...

532
00:41:09.218 --> 00:41:10.986
I wasn't really myself that day.

533
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.056
You saw my medical report too.

534
00:41:14.523 --> 00:41:17.693
I'm suffering from depression.

535
00:41:17.826 --> 00:41:20.696
It's because she still needs to work on her faith.

536
00:41:20.963 --> 00:41:22.231
She's my daughter.

537
00:41:22.231 --> 00:41:25.701
Think about it. What father doesn't know how his daughter feels?

538
00:41:26.535 --> 00:41:29.438
Spiritual Father, the afternoon service will start shortly.

539
00:41:29.438 --> 00:41:31.440
Shall I delay it a little?

540
00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.175
No, there's no need.

541
00:41:33.375 --> 00:41:36.445
Our believers came all the way here for it.

542
00:41:36.812 --> 00:41:38.480
I cannot make them wait.

543
00:41:40.249 --> 00:41:41.316
Detective.

544
00:41:42.618 --> 00:41:45.454
Please excuse me.

545
00:41:46.455 --> 00:41:48.690
- Okay, then one last question. - That's enough.

546
00:41:49.024 --> 00:41:52.361
I know that you're a cop, but this is out of line.

547
00:41:52.494 --> 00:41:55.464
I mean, it's not like we're criminals.

548
00:41:55.631 --> 00:41:57.699
We live in a country where everyone has the freedom of religion.

549
00:41:58.367 --> 00:41:59.701
Aren't I right?

550
00:42:04.373 --> 00:42:05.841
Why did you just laugh?

551
00:42:06.008 --> 00:42:07.576
Well, you know.

552
00:42:08.744 --> 00:42:10.846
You said exactly what I was expecting to hear.

553
00:42:12.147 --> 00:42:13.282
Sorry?

554
00:42:13.282 --> 00:42:16.285
I was wondering when you'd bring it up, and you finally did.

555
00:42:16.285 --> 00:42:17.486
The freedom of religion.

556
00:42:19.421 --> 00:42:21.957
Well, I'll get going then.

557
00:42:32.201 --> 00:42:34.269
Sang Hwan, Sang Hwan! Come over here quickly.

558
00:42:34.269 --> 00:42:36.138
- What's going on? - We have big news.

559
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.175
- We uploaded a video, you know. - Right.

560
00:42:40.175 --> 00:42:42.978
Someone posted a photo after seeing the cross in the video.

561
00:42:42.978 --> 00:42:44.079
Have a look at this.

562
00:42:44.546 --> 00:42:45.647
Isn't it exactly the same?

563
00:42:46.882 --> 00:42:49.218
Hey, do you know where this is?

564
00:42:49.218 --> 00:42:52.154
I've been messaging the person who posted this, but no reply yet.

565
00:42:52.154 --> 00:42:53.355
There's no phone number either.

566
00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:55.691
Hey, can you zoom in on that thing?

567
00:42:56.792 --> 00:42:57.893
This?

(Daegu Express, Moving and Delivery Services)

569
00:43:03.232 --> 00:43:04.600
Does that mean it's Daegu?

570
00:43:06.335 --> 00:43:07.402
Should we try to find her?

571
00:43:08.136 --> 00:43:10.539
Hey, Daegu isn't a tiny country town.

572
00:43:10.606 --> 00:43:12.140
And it's not like we're deliverymen.

573
00:43:13.942 --> 00:43:15.143
There's Pil Soo.

574
00:43:29.558 --> 00:43:31.326
Our believers won't appreciate that.

575
00:43:33.762 --> 00:43:34.963
Sorry.

576
00:43:36.098 --> 00:43:39.401
And if you happen to see those young men again,

577
00:43:39.635 --> 00:43:41.904
please pass along my message to them.

Sure, what is it?

Please let them know that I'd really like to meet them again.

580
00:43:46.975 --> 00:43:48.710
We need to clear up the misunderstandings.

581
00:44:11.967 --> 00:44:13.101
Sir.

582
00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:16.605
- Nice to meet you. - It's an honor to meet you.

583
00:44:16.605 --> 00:44:18.740
- Let's go in. - Sure.

584

are you guys up to?

586
00:44:37.292 --> 00:44:39.594
- Chief. - What did they say?

587
00:44:39.728 --> 00:44:43.131
They said that she and her grandmother fought a lot...

588
00:44:43.131 --> 00:44:44.633
about money before she ran away from home.

589
00:44:48.003 --> 00:44:50.639
- Money? - She said to her grandmother...

590
00:44:50.706 --> 00:44:53.742
that she has to go to the paradise or whatever it's called...

591
00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:57.846
and begged for 2,000 dollars, but her grandmother said no.

592
00:44:58.246 --> 00:45:02.784
Then she yelled at her grandmother calling her a demon and stormed out.

593
00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:10.225
Oh, Chief. Where are you going?

594
00:45:10.392 --> 00:45:12.294
Let's go out for soju. It's been too long.

595
00:45:13.328 --> 00:45:16.565
Go home early, and tend to your family.

You all got the questionnaire, right?

599
00:45:25.107 --> 00:45:26.308
- Yes. - Yes.

600
00:45:26.608 --> 00:45:30.846
If you can't answer "yes" to all the questions with conviction,

601
00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:33.048
you won't be able to get on the Boat of Salvation.

602
00:45:33.248 --> 00:45:36.051
All right then. Who wants to answer the questions?

603
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.654
Dong Cheol?

604
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:42.691
Me?

605
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:44.453
Apostle Kang, are you inside?

606
00:46:45.854 --> 00:46:50.125
Do you know and firmly believe that your name is in the "Book of Life"?

607
00:46:51.693 --> 00:46:53.962
Oh, the "Book of Life"...

608
00:46:55.764 --> 00:46:56.765
No.

609
00:46:56.898 --> 00:46:59.367
Do you believe that Almighty is alive?

610
00:47:00.302 --> 00:47:01.369
No.

611
00:47:02.771 --> 00:47:05.807
The rest of you should answer the questions in your head too.

612
00:47:06.408 --> 00:47:09.244
Do you trust that you'll get on the Boat of Salvation?

613
00:47:11.446 --> 00:47:12.481
No.

614
00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:16.318
Do you believe Spiritual Father to be your parent spiritually?

615
00:47:16.518 --> 00:47:19.020
No, not yet.

616
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.723
How many questions did you answer "no" to?

617
00:47:24.926 --> 00:47:26.394
I don't think I said "yes" to anything.

618

What about you guys?

619
00:47:31.533 --> 00:47:35.470
Then none of you will be able to reach the paradise.

620

Do you all want to end up in the fiery pit?

621
00:47:38.907 --> 00:47:43.378
I'll show you the difference between the paradise and the fiery pit.

622
00:47:43.378 --> 00:47:45.413
Let's watch a video about it.

630
00:51:48.289 --> 00:51:49.758
- You made it. - Yes.

631
00:51:49.758 --> 00:51:51.426
- Please have a seat. - Sure.

632

633
00:51:58.166 --> 00:52:01.102
that you've been chosen by Almighty.

634
00:52:01.669 --> 00:52:02.837
I'm flattered.

635
00:52:03.405 --> 00:52:07.642
Almighty loves you very much, Mr. Han.

636

639
00:52:20.121 --> 00:52:23.925
Of course. Now that you've become our fellow believer,

640
00:52:23.925 --> 00:52:26.861
Muji-gun will become an even better place to live.

643
00:52:36.538 --> 00:52:38.339
- You! - Yes.

644
00:52:39.174 --> 00:52:42.610
How many years have I been devoted to the delivery industry?

645
00:52:43.044 --> 00:52:44.145
Well...

646
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.349
You got into the industry in middle school, so it's been over 20 years.

647
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:49.551
What about me?

648
00:52:49.551 --> 00:52:51.286

00:53:27.088 --> 00:53:30.358
Oh, he's carrying the delivery bag in his left hand.

659
00:53:30.458 --> 00:53:34.028
Look at this angle as he's making a turn. He sure is a pro.

660
00:53:34.996 --> 00:53:38.900
A lefty who's a pro. There aren't many guys that are like that.

661
00:53:39.334 --> 00:53:41.703
- Would it be Forehead? - He retired last year.

662
00:53:41.703 --> 00:53:44.038
- Why? - He hurt a disc on his wrist.

663
00:53:44.038 --> 00:53:47.108
Seriously? My goodness, he's not even 30 yet.

664
00:53:48.142 --> 00:53:49.878
Hey, can this guy be...

665
00:53:49.878 --> 00:53:52.580
You idiots are wasting all your time here.

666
00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:54.849
Gosh, ma'am. What's your problem now?

667
00:53:54.849 --> 00:53:58.486
Ma'am? You're only a few years younger than me.

668
00:53:58.786 --> 00:54:00.922
You're right, miss. Please calm down.

669
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:02.590
My bad.

670
00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:04.492
I didn't say anything.

671
00:54:04.492 --> 00:54:05.994
Will you guys drive your scooter drunk?

672
00:54:05.994 --> 00:54:08.296
Gosh, I'm done for the day.

673
00:54:08.296 --> 00:54:09.464
Me too.

674
00:54:09.464 --> 00:54:10.665
Is that right?

675
00:54:11.533 --> 00:54:13.268
Then order some food!

676
00:54:13.268 --> 00:54:15.036
Munch on squid or something, you punks!

677
00:54:15.036 --> 00:54:18.172
- Gosh, wait. It hurts! - Let go!

678
00:54:18.172 --> 00:54:20.375
How can you be so strong? Goodness.

679
00:54:21.743 --> 00:54:24.078
Gosh, what's wrong with her?

680
00:54:25.446 --> 00:54:26.915
Goodness gracious.

681
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:30.919
If you order ever again, I'll make sure your noodles are all sodden.

682
00:54:31.386 --> 00:54:35.657
Gosh, that woman has such a nasty temper. Unbelievable.

683
00:54:35.924 --> 00:54:39.127
By the way, weren't you going to say something to us?

684
00:54:39.127 --> 00:54:42.630
Oh, right. I think that guy is Cheetah.

685
00:54:44.632 --> 00:54:45.733
Cheetah?

686
00:54:45.967 --> 00:54:48.469
- Yes! It's Cheetah. - Right?

687
00:54:48.469 --> 00:54:51.839
I heard from other guys that he works in Daegu now.

688
00:54:52.407 --> 00:54:53.608
I knew it.

689
00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:57.078
You're sure, right?

690
00:54:57.178 --> 00:55:00.648
Sang Hwan, I've been in this line of work for two decades.

691
00:55:00.782 --> 00:55:02.183
Of course I'm sure.

692
00:55:24.105 --> 00:55:26.307
I heard you wanted to see me.

693
00:55:40.722 --> 00:55:42.690
Come closer.

694
00:55:53.001 --> 00:55:54.068
Only believe...

695
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:58.339
in Almighty and pray.

696
00:56:03.478 --> 00:56:05.046
Empty your mind of everything.

697
00:56:06.514 --> 00:56:11.886
Are you ready to accept Almighty with all of your heart?

698
00:56:23.031 --> 00:56:24.232
Why did you...

699
00:56:25.733 --> 00:56:27.468
choose me as Spiritual Mother?

700
00:56:29.103 --> 00:56:32.173
You've been chosen to atone for all of our sins on our behalf,

701
00:56:32.173 --> 00:56:34.776
and it was Almighty's choice.

702
00:56:34.776 --> 00:56:38.212
That's not what I was asking. Tell me the real reason.

703
00:56:39.313 --> 00:56:40.915
Why did it have to be me?

704
00:56:42.483 --> 00:56:43.818
Why my dad?

705
00:56:45.253 --> 00:56:46.487
Why my mom?

706
00:56:48.322 --> 00:56:49.991
Why did it have to be my family?

707
00:56:50.625 --> 00:56:51.793
It's all...

708
00:56:52.727 --> 00:56:55.496
part of Almighty's plan.

709
00:56:55.496 --> 00:56:56.564
You know...

710
00:56:58.199 --> 00:57:01.135
that I'm not sincerely obeying you now.

711
00:57:02.704 --> 00:57:05.473
I'm only doing this to protect my mom, and you know it.

712
00:57:11.946 --> 00:57:13.281
Why are you doing this to me?

713
00:57:15.116 --> 00:57:16.617
What is the real reason?

714
00:57:19.587 --> 00:57:20.788
Sang Mi,

715
00:57:22.457 --> 00:57:25.760
you don't believe in me even though I'm Spiritual Father.

716
00:57:27.762 --> 00:57:28.830
All right.

717
00:57:35.937 --> 00:57:37.305
A long time ago,

718
00:57:39.073 --> 00:57:43.911
there was a female volunteer who used to visit my place.

719
00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.382
She had such a pure soul,

720
00:57:49.383 --> 00:57:50.818
and she was very pretty too.

721
00:57:53.221 --> 00:57:54.922
But I guess I was...

722
00:57:57.925 --> 00:58:00.561
too impatient back then.

723
00:58:03.264 --> 00:58:06.567
Fruit has to ripen...

724
00:58:07.335 --> 00:58:08.569
to taste sweeter...

725
00:58:09.804 --> 00:58:11.539
and more delicious.

726
00:58:18.546 --> 00:58:20.448
One day, I heard...

727
00:58:20.848 --> 00:58:24.152
that she jumped to her death from the rooftop at her school.

728
00:58:25.386 --> 00:58:28.756
It was very sad.

729
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.159
All I wanted was...

730
00:58:32.326 --> 00:58:36.030
to teach her the secret to salvation.

731
00:58:39.801 --> 00:58:45.106
That's why I thought this when I first saw you.

732
00:58:46.607 --> 00:58:47.742
"This time,"

733
00:58:49.577 --> 00:58:51.546
"I must not fail."

734
00:59:00.721 --> 00:59:01.823
Now,

735
00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:06.394
do you understand the real reason why I chose you?

736
00:59:19.473 --> 00:59:22.944
You have nowhere to run.

737
00:59:23.911 --> 00:59:26.414
If you step back, you'll be standing on the edge of a cliff.

738
00:59:36.657 --> 00:59:37.892
Try all you want,

739
00:59:40.127 --> 00:59:41.996
and scream for help.

740
00:59:45.399 --> 00:59:48.236
Here, there's only one person who can save you.

741
00:59:49.804 --> 00:59:50.938
Me.

742
00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:53.574
There's no one else.

743
01:00:05.987 --> 01:00:07.221
Are you saying...

744
01:00:08.289 --> 01:00:10.858
you're doing all this because I look like the girl you killed?

745
01:00:11.792 --> 01:00:14.295
Is that why you chose me and my family?

746
01:00:18.132 --> 01:00:20.534
If you keep this up,

747
01:00:21.602 --> 01:00:25.840
I might have to change my ways.

748
01:00:48.129 --> 01:00:50.798
(Save Me)

749
01:00:54.669 --> 01:00:55.703
Hey.

750
01:00:56.537 --> 01:00:57.705
Get up already.

751
01:00:57.705 --> 01:00:58.873
I...

752
01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:01.909
I don't like you, Chief.

753
01:01:02.276 --> 01:01:03.678
I don't even trust you...

754
01:01:03.678 --> 01:01:05.513
because of what happened with Dong Cheol three years back...

755
01:01:05.513 --> 01:01:09.684
and how you made Sang Mi go back there a while ago.

756
01:01:10.451 --> 01:01:13.654
But I need your help now.

757
01:01:13.788 --> 01:01:18.426
Right now, I need someone who has investigative authority,

758
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.829
so I really need you.
