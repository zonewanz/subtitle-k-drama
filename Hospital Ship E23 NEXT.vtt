1
00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:11.314
Of course, I'll do it.

2
00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:14.654
Your father's life depends on it.

3
00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:16.025
What you did was disgraceful,

4
00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:18.395
but doing the operation is only right.

5
00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:21.424
- Thank you. - Unfortunately,

6
00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.935
I can't free up my schedule because it's already packed.

7
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.305
When I worked with a talented doctor like you,

8
00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:32.104
I could free up a day or two.

9
00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:35.244
However, it's impossible to do that now.

10
00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:36.604
Professor...

11
00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:38.644
You should find another doctor.

12
00:00:39.574 --> 00:00:41.314
Please consider it one more time.

13
00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:45.385
I feel bad, but I have no choice.

14
00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:47.525
- Professor... - You should leave.

15
00:00:50.924 --> 00:00:52.155
I beg you.

16
00:00:59.564 --> 00:01:01.265
I beg you, professor.

17
00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:07.074
Please save my father.

18
00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:12.014
If you save my father,

19
00:01:12.014 --> 00:01:14.785
I will do everything I can to return the favor.

20
00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:17.714
So please...

21
00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:19.755
Why are you doing this, Eun Jae?

22
00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:22.624
You're making me look like I'm a bad doctor...

23
00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:24.255
who is choosing not to do the surgery.

24
00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:32.264
How can you do this to her?

25
00:01:33.294 --> 00:01:35.464
Think about how Doctor Song helped you.

26
00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:37.604
- You can't do this to her. - What are you doing?

27
00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:39.234
You are choosing not to do it.

28
00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:41.305
You just want her to pay for betraying you.

29
00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:43.874
Doctor Kim, what are you doing?

30
00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:46.244
- Stop it right now. - Doctor Song.

31
00:01:46.244 --> 00:01:48.014
Apologize to Professor Kim.

32
00:01:48.214 --> 00:01:49.415
I don't want to.

33
00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:52.854
I'm sorry for causing a big fuss.

34
00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:54.624
Everything is my fault.

35
00:01:54.624 --> 00:01:56.824
But please forgive...

36
00:01:57.494 --> 00:01:59.755
Doctor Kim this time.

37
00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:13.875
Doctor Song!

38
00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:18.715
Doctor Song!

39
00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:22.885
I don't think I've been a good teacher to you.

40
00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:24.084
Why do you say that?

41
00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:27.924
Is this how I taught you?

42
00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:31.024
Where did you learn to doubt...

43
00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:32.454
fellow doctors?

44
00:02:33.024 --> 00:02:36.065
Would you have done that?

45
00:02:36.764 --> 00:02:39.195
Would you refuse to save a patient...

46
00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:41.905
just because of a grudge you're holding against someone...

47
00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:44.274
even though you have enough time?

48
00:02:44.274 --> 00:02:47.044
- Of course not. - But why do you think he would?

49
00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:49.044
- That's because... - Keep this in mind.

50
00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:52.644
Professor Kim is not only your teacher...

51
00:02:52.644 --> 00:02:54.285
but also your colleague.

52
00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:56.745
If you don't trust your colleagues,

53
00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:58.415
you can't operate properly with them.

54
00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:01.685
If you can't operate with them, you can't save your patients.

55
00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:06.225
Do you understand what I am talking about?

56
00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:10.065
- Yes, Doctor Song. - All right then.

57
00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:39.625
Dad, wake up. Dad!

58
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:42.465
Excuse me! Please come here!

59
00:03:42.995 --> 00:03:44.935
What's wrong with you, Dad?

60
00:03:45.264 --> 00:03:48.905
We have a code blue in room 112. We have a code blue in room 112.

61
00:03:55.774 --> 00:03:58.745
- Eun Jae! Eun Jae! - What is it, Woo Jae?

62
00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:02.584
There's something wrong with Dad.

63
00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:05.854
Woo Jae, calm down, okay?

64
00:04:06.984 --> 00:04:09.584
Did you call a doctor?

65
00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:13.764
- Take me to the airport. Quickly. - All right.

66
00:04:14.524 --> 00:04:17.195
Woo Jae, listen to me carefully.

67
00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:20.305
I'm going there right now. Calm down.

68
00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:22.034
Get a hold of yourself, okay?

69
00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:24.875
All right, Eun Jae. Come quickly.

70
00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:27.745
Dad is going to be all right. Nothing bad is going to happen.

71
00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:35.584
Nothing bad is going to happen.

72
00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:38.115
Of course not.

73
00:04:39.615 --> 00:04:41.885
Can you hurry up, please?

74
00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:44.594
Someone must be sick.

75
00:04:48.664 --> 00:04:50.264
Please.

76
00:05:04.144 --> 00:05:05.675
Nothing's going to happen.

77
00:05:10.654 --> 00:05:13.485
Are we there yet?

78
00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:14.724
Miss.

79
00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:18.324
I think you already missed the last flight.

80
00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:19.695
What?

81
00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:32.675
Sir.

82
00:05:32.974 --> 00:05:34.844
Could you please...

83
00:05:35.204 --> 00:05:38.245
stop the car? Please?

84
00:06:04.704 --> 00:06:07.344
(Medical chart)

85
00:06:14.514 --> 00:06:15.914
Park Sung Ryeol.

(Park Sung Ryeol)

87
00:06:30.894 --> 00:06:32.135
Is it too late?

88
00:06:40.745 --> 00:06:43.914
Hello, this is Haeshim Island's clinic.

89
00:06:43.914 --> 00:06:45.474
Hi, sorry for calling so late.

90
00:06:45.474 --> 00:06:47.685
I'm Doctor Kwak Hyun from the hospital ship.

91
00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:48.815
Oh, hello.

92
00:06:48.885 --> 00:06:52.685
Have Park Sung Ryeol check his blood sugar on an empty stomach.

93
00:06:52.885 --> 00:06:54.485
I called ahead.

94
00:06:54.954 --> 00:06:58.195
He's bound to forget and eat breakfast straight away.

95
00:06:58.195 --> 00:06:59.255
I know.

96
00:06:59.255 --> 00:07:02.464
Don't you worry. I'll visit him early in the morning.

97
00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.594
Okay, thank you.

98
00:07:04.964 --> 00:07:05.995
Bye.

99
00:07:14.805 --> 00:07:16.344
(Song Eun Jae)

100
00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:22.144
Hello?

101
00:07:22.144 --> 00:07:23.144
This is...

102
00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:26.584
- Song Eun Jae. - Hi.

103
00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.125
Talk to me. What's wrong?

104
00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:35.995
Hello?

105
00:07:36.464 --> 00:07:37.464
Doctor Song.

106
00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:41.735
Where are you? Why are the cars so close?

107
00:07:44.574 --> 00:07:46.635
I need to board a plane,

108
00:07:47.574 --> 00:07:48.945
but I couldn't.

109
00:07:52.074 --> 00:07:54.385
I'm about to go to the station, but...

110
00:07:55.644 --> 00:07:56.685
Where are you?

111
00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.315
Tell me where you are. I'll come over.

112
00:08:00.724 --> 00:08:04.154
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

113
00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.264
Could you go to Woo Jae?

114
00:08:10.565 --> 00:08:13.164
I think they issued a Code Blue on my dad.

115
00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:18.305
My brother's all alone.

116
00:08:19.175 --> 00:08:20.204
That's why.

117
00:08:20.545 --> 00:08:21.675
Okay.

118
00:08:22.445 --> 00:08:23.574
I'll go over there.

119
00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.545
I'll stay with Woo Jae.

120
00:08:27.844 --> 00:08:29.685
So don't cry...

121
00:08:30.485 --> 00:08:31.685
and listen to me.

122
00:08:33.755 --> 00:08:34.784
Your dad...

123
00:08:36.585 --> 00:08:37.894
will be fine.

124
00:08:38.855 --> 00:08:41.794
I'll protect him with all my might, so...

125
00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:47.835
Take your time and get here safely.

126
00:08:50.475 --> 00:08:51.605
Don't get lost.

127
00:08:53.975 --> 00:08:54.975
Okay?

128
00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:01.644
Yes.

129
00:09:34.514 --> 00:09:35.585
Hello.

130
00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:41.684
He bled from the drainage tube, but he's stable now.

131
00:09:41.855 --> 00:09:43.794
They'll test him in the morning...

132
00:09:43.794 --> 00:09:44.794
No.

133
00:09:45.294 --> 00:09:46.965
He doesn't need tests.

134
00:09:46.965 --> 00:09:48.664
He needs surgery.

135
00:09:48.965 --> 00:09:52.064
We must open him up to find the cause of the bleeding.

136
00:09:52.764 --> 00:09:54.205
- If not... - Stop.

137
00:09:55.434 --> 00:09:56.605
That's enough.

138
00:09:57.934 --> 00:09:59.304
Don't think for now.

139
00:10:00.135 --> 00:10:01.605
I'll stay here tonight.

140
00:10:02.075 --> 00:10:04.245
Go to the dorm and sleep. Don't...

141
00:10:04.245 --> 00:10:06.615
No. I'm okay now.

142
00:10:08.944 --> 00:10:10.284
I'll stay.

143
00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:14.924
Okay then.

144
00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:35.075
Go to the dorm and sleep when Woo Jae wakes.

145
00:10:35.845 --> 00:10:38.544
Fortunately, you have tomorrow off.

146
00:10:39.174 --> 00:10:40.314
- I... - Still,

147
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:42.784
thank you.

148
00:10:44.455 --> 00:10:45.554
For thinking of me...

149
00:10:46.825 --> 00:10:48.455
when you needed someone.

150
00:10:51.125 --> 00:10:52.125
I'm off.

151
00:11:05.404 --> 00:11:07.904
(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

152
00:11:08.904 --> 00:11:09.975
Bleeding?

153
00:11:11.774 --> 00:11:14.784
- Is it serious? - Testing doesn't help now.

154
00:11:15.345 --> 00:11:17.184
Before he suffers from hypovolemic shock,

155
00:11:17.184 --> 00:11:20.085
we must open him up to identify the cause.

156
00:11:22.485 --> 00:11:24.694
We must rush the operation.

157
00:11:25.424 --> 00:11:27.694
- Yes. - What did Doctor Kim say?

158
00:11:27.694 --> 00:11:31.635
He has too many surgeries and can't free his schedule.

159
00:11:31.635 --> 00:11:33.534
Is that really his reason?

160
00:11:34.304 --> 00:11:36.875
He has too many patients and can't take one more?

161
00:11:37.575 --> 00:11:38.605
Of course.

162
00:11:39.005 --> 00:11:40.205
Tell the truth.

163
00:11:40.944 --> 00:11:44.314
- Does his grudge for you... - No. That's not true.

164
00:11:49.914 --> 00:11:52.914
I will operate on my dad, director.

165
00:11:53.184 --> 00:11:54.455
Doctor Song.

166
00:11:54.455 --> 00:11:55.954
If we stall any longer,

167
00:11:55.979 --> 00:11:57.418
I might not get a chance.

168
00:11:57.495 --> 00:11:58.625
Please say yes.

169
00:12:01.264 --> 00:12:03.024
I can't lose my dad too...

170
00:12:05.135 --> 00:12:07.465
without doing anything.

171
00:12:13.674 --> 00:12:14.674
Okay.

172
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:18.444
Let's give it a shot.

173
00:12:19.444 --> 00:12:20.544
Thank you.

174
00:12:24.455 --> 00:12:25.684
It's better with milk.

175
00:12:26.284 --> 00:12:28.524
- Try it. - Thank you.

176
00:12:30.825 --> 00:12:31.855
Did you hear?

177
00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:34.465
- Hear what? - Doctor Song's dad.

178
00:12:35.694 --> 00:12:36.865
She'll operate on him.

179
00:12:37.564 --> 00:12:39.164
- What? - What was that?

180
00:12:40.404 --> 00:12:42.664
Doctor Song will do what?

181
00:12:43.235 --> 00:12:45.205
Operate on her own dad?

182
00:12:45.205 --> 00:12:46.335
What does he have?

183
00:12:46.605 --> 00:12:48.774
Why didn't she tell us anything?

184
00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:50.674
Doctor Kwak.

185
00:12:51.444 --> 00:12:52.475
What's that look about?

186
00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.684
Are you upset he revealed a secret?

187
00:12:55.444 --> 00:12:57.684
I can't believe Doctor Song didn't tell,

188
00:12:58.115 --> 00:13:00.184
but I'm more upset with the both of you.

189
00:13:00.184 --> 00:13:01.225
Nurse Pyo.

190
00:13:01.855 --> 00:13:03.024
Aren't we family?

191
00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:06.294
How could you not tell us when Doctor Song's dad...

192
00:13:06.654 --> 00:13:08.924
is sick enough to need surgery?

193
00:13:09.225 --> 00:13:10.294
Try to understand.

194
00:13:10.835 --> 00:13:13.934
You know better than anyone what Doctor Song is like.

195
00:13:13.934 --> 00:13:15.335
I can't understand.

196
00:13:15.465 --> 00:13:17.674
I won't even try to.

197
00:13:18.274 --> 00:13:19.904
- Let go of me. - Nurse Pyo.

198
00:13:20.034 --> 00:13:21.644
Nurse Pyo.

199
00:13:22.944 --> 00:13:26.014
She's really upset this time.

200
00:13:26.674 --> 00:13:29.414
What if she doesn't want to be my partner?

201
00:13:29.414 --> 00:13:32.255
Why worry? You have me.

202
00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:35.225
What?

203
00:13:35.225 --> 00:13:38.424
Keep quiet. Now is not the time for jokes.

204
00:13:38.424 --> 00:13:39.725
Why are you so slow?

205
00:13:48.064 --> 00:13:49.135
Over here.

206
00:13:56.144 --> 00:13:57.774
You have a really important surgery.

207
00:13:58.615 --> 00:14:00.144
Why didn't you call me?

208
00:14:00.684 --> 00:14:02.245
Don't you need an assistant?

209
00:14:03.044 --> 00:14:05.355
- Nurse Pyo. - Sorry.

210
00:14:06.014 --> 00:14:09.385
We work together every day and I didn't know a thing.

211
00:14:10.394 --> 00:14:13.524
I should've been able to tell even when you said nothing.

212
00:14:14.524 --> 00:14:15.524
Right?

213
00:14:15.965 --> 00:14:18.135
What is going on here?

214
00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:25.804
You left as if you never wanted to see her again.

215
00:14:25.804 --> 00:14:28.105
When did I leave like that?

216
00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:31.014
You should tell us about these things.

217
00:14:31.014 --> 00:14:33.115
Why didn't you tell us?

218
00:14:33.314 --> 00:14:34.885
When someone's sick,

219
00:14:34.885 --> 00:14:38.755
you need to tell people so they can look out for cures.

220
00:14:39.814 --> 00:14:41.284
Doctor Song.

221
00:14:42.554 --> 00:14:43.755
Cheer up.

222
00:14:44.325 --> 00:14:47.194
We can't help you, but we'll support you from outside.

223
00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:49.164
Be strong.

224
00:14:50.164 --> 00:14:51.235
Good luck.

225
00:14:54.034 --> 00:14:55.034
Thank you.

226
00:14:55.534 --> 00:14:57.135
Come on.

227
00:14:57.135 --> 00:14:59.835
- I'm sorry, okay? - Okay.

228
00:14:59.835 --> 00:15:02.544
We should help at a time like this.

229
00:15:11.554 --> 00:15:13.755
What brought you all the way here?

230
00:15:13.924 --> 00:15:15.855
I had business in Seoul, so I stopped by.

231
00:15:17.855 --> 00:15:19.894
Do you have time for a cup of tea?

232
00:15:19.894 --> 00:15:22.325
Of course. Come with me.

233
00:15:28.264 --> 00:15:30.934
Dr. Song will do the operation herself?

234
00:15:32.475 --> 00:15:34.575
She has no other choice.

235
00:15:37.215 --> 00:15:38.514
Will you be okay?

236
00:15:39.444 --> 00:15:41.444
Be okay with what?

237
00:15:41.444 --> 00:15:44.855
Will you be okay with Dr. Song's operating...

238
00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:46.355
on her own father?

239
00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:48.485
What's your point?

240
00:15:48.485 --> 00:15:50.625
I'm giving you a chance.

241
00:15:51.355 --> 00:15:53.625
A chance to be a mature person.

242
00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:56.495
- Dr. Kim. - You're standing at a crossroad.

243
00:15:57.064 --> 00:16:00.404
Will you be a self-righteous and stubborn old man?

244
00:16:00.605 --> 00:16:04.105
Or will you be a wise and virtuous adult?

245
00:16:06.135 --> 00:16:08.444
What kind of a person do you want to be as you age?

246
00:16:23.468 --> 00:16:26.700
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 23 Hospital Ship "It's Not Your Fault"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

247
00:16:40.705 --> 00:16:43.274
- Is something wrong? - No.

248
00:16:44.174 --> 00:16:47.885
Did Jeil Hospital's director come because of Dr. Song?

249
00:16:48.644 --> 00:16:52.284
Song Eun Jae will perform the operation on her father.

250
00:16:53.585 --> 00:16:57.424
Why are you surprised? Isn't it obvious that she would?

251
00:16:57.424 --> 00:16:59.625
That's still...

252
00:17:04.434 --> 00:17:05.994
Professor.

253
00:17:07.004 --> 00:17:10.575
It's not my place, but I'd like to say something.

254
00:17:11.704 --> 00:17:14.004
I think you should let her win this time.

255
00:17:14.444 --> 00:17:16.914
No matter how much you hate her, this isn't right.

256
00:17:17.015 --> 00:17:19.575
You must perform the operation.

257
00:17:19.575 --> 00:17:21.714
Is that what you also think?

258
00:17:22.144 --> 00:17:25.254
Did I refuse to do the operation because I dislike Dr. Song?

259
00:17:25.355 --> 00:17:27.154
Isn't that why?

260
00:17:27.154 --> 00:17:29.085
It's not because I dislike her.

261
00:17:29.085 --> 00:17:31.224
What if it's because I'm afraid?

262
00:17:31.654 --> 00:17:33.595
Will you stop respecting me?

263
00:17:34.025 --> 00:17:35.795
Please don't say that.

264
00:17:36.095 --> 00:17:38.394
Have you seen her father's records?

265
00:17:39.295 --> 00:17:41.335
Not only does it require liver lobectomy,

266
00:17:41.335 --> 00:17:45.004
but it also involves whipple operation. It's a big deal.

267
00:17:45.535 --> 00:17:49.105
No matter how good you are, success rate is less than 30 percent.

268
00:17:51.115 --> 00:17:53.345
There's a selection for the director position at the hospital.

269
00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:55.914
I should be careful not to be eliminated.

270
00:17:55.914 --> 00:17:58.815
I can't put myself at risk to lose my job.

271
00:17:58.815 --> 00:18:01.855
- However... - It's Song Eun Jae of all people.

272
00:18:02.754 --> 00:18:05.924
She's smart enough to do a good job.

273
00:18:07.394 --> 00:18:09.494
She can do it.

274
00:18:10.664 --> 00:18:13.565
The patient's name is Song Jae Joon. He is 59 years old.

275
00:18:13.565 --> 00:18:16.004
The tumor started in the biliary tract.

276
00:18:16.004 --> 00:18:18.635
Currently, it has spread to the pancreas and the liver.

277
00:18:19.204 --> 00:18:20.404
For his case,

278
00:18:20.404 --> 00:18:23.204
I'll perform liver lobectomy and Whipple operation...

279
00:18:23.204 --> 00:18:25.045
simultaneously.

280
00:18:25.575 --> 00:18:27.815
The expected operation time is 12 hours.

281
00:18:47.704 --> 00:18:49.464
(Song Jae Joon)

282
00:19:09.125 --> 00:19:10.295
Drink this.

283
00:19:11.954 --> 00:19:15.095
Your face is screaming for caffeine.

284
00:19:22.004 --> 00:19:25.275
Or shall we go out and have a drink?

285
00:19:25.434 --> 00:19:28.305
- 1 drink is good for exhaustion. - Have 2.

286
00:19:29.944 --> 00:19:32.345
Have two drinks and sleep in the dormitory.

287
00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:33.615
It's okay.

288
00:19:34.815 --> 00:19:36.115
Listen to me.

289
00:19:36.115 --> 00:19:38.454
You need enough rest for the operation.

290
00:19:38.454 --> 00:19:40.585
Woo Jae is definitely right.

291
00:19:40.585 --> 00:19:44.025
Please take my sister to the dormitory.

292
00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:49.964
Eun Jae.

293
00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:53.194
It's this way.

294
00:20:00.135 --> 00:20:02.704
That can't be easy.

295
00:20:03.174 --> 00:20:05.644
How does she get lost at her own hospital?

296
00:20:05.644 --> 00:20:08.345
She still knows her way to the operation room.

297
00:20:08.345 --> 00:20:10.684
Are you trying to side with her?

298
00:20:19.894 --> 00:20:21.394
It's finally tomorrow.

299
00:20:22.194 --> 00:20:23.394
Are you worried?

300
00:20:24.464 --> 00:20:28.135
No, I won't worry.

301
00:20:30.704 --> 00:20:32.835
You're always so brave.

302
00:20:34.744 --> 00:20:36.704
Have you forgotten that I'm your senior?

303
00:20:37.275 --> 00:20:39.744
The way you're speaking isn't appropriate.

304
00:20:48.484 --> 00:20:51.924
Do you remember what you asked me?

305
00:20:53.154 --> 00:20:54.994
"Why do you keep pushing me away"?

306
00:20:57.835 --> 00:21:02.065
You asked if it's because you couldn't save my mother.

307
00:21:05.434 --> 00:21:07.305
You have the right to resent me.

308
00:21:10.075 --> 00:21:14.184
If I were you, I'd resent myself.

309
00:21:16.214 --> 00:21:17.585
I was her guardian.

310
00:21:20.525 --> 00:21:22.424
From the guardian's perspective...

311
00:21:23.595 --> 00:21:26.625
When you lose your family member unexpectedly,

312
00:21:28.025 --> 00:21:30.565
you can't help but resent someone.

313
00:21:32.565 --> 00:21:37.275
Even if it's a good doctor like you.

314
00:21:41.805 --> 00:21:43.404
I read the charts.

315
00:21:44.214 --> 00:21:46.644
Your diagnoses were meticulous.

316
00:21:48.115 --> 00:21:51.055
From stomach diseases to heart diseases,

317
00:21:52.815 --> 00:21:56.684
you made diagnoses that weren't obvious.

318
00:21:57.394 --> 00:21:58.694
More importantly,

319
00:22:00.055 --> 00:22:03.765
I'm sure that you explained kindly to my mother.

320
00:22:05.434 --> 00:22:09.404
Mom was afraid to come to my hospital because of me,

321
00:22:11.734 --> 00:22:14.045
but she mustered up the courage to see a doctor.

322
00:22:18.444 --> 00:22:19.775
That's why.

323
00:22:22.484 --> 00:22:25.385
It's the reason why I tried to push you away.

324
00:22:29.385 --> 00:22:34.025
It's because you're such a good doctor.

325
00:22:36.365 --> 00:22:38.135
I don't want to lose...

326
00:22:38.964 --> 00:22:40.904
such a great colleague.

327
00:22:45.375 --> 00:22:46.904
If we remain colleagues,

328
00:22:47.105 --> 00:22:51.275
we can work together for a long time.

329
00:23:17.775 --> 00:23:20.375
- Gosh. - The traffic is heavy.

330
00:23:20.944 --> 00:23:23.244
There's an endless line of buses...

331
00:23:23.244 --> 00:23:25.214
It's Chuseok.

332
00:23:25.575 --> 00:23:28.714
I wish it were after Chuseok.

333
00:23:31.385 --> 00:23:33.984
Do you mean the operation?

334
00:23:35.525 --> 00:23:36.625
Yes.

335
00:23:38.224 --> 00:23:39.325
Then...

336
00:23:40.994 --> 00:23:43.194
I could prepare...

337
00:23:44.635 --> 00:23:48.164
a memorial service for your mother.

338
00:23:49.404 --> 00:23:52.704
You can visit her grave when you get better after the operation.

339
00:23:53.644 --> 00:23:55.504
Mom will understand.

340
00:24:00.914 --> 00:24:01.944
What's wrong?

341
00:24:03.754 --> 00:24:05.885
It hasn't been told in a while...

342
00:24:05.885 --> 00:24:06.984
Never mind.

343
00:24:06.984 --> 00:24:10.085
Children play traditional games with their relatives.

344
00:24:10.085 --> 00:24:11.194
You're right.

345
00:24:16.424 --> 00:24:18.565
Let's do that.

346
00:24:19.234 --> 00:24:20.305
Okay.

347
00:24:24.635 --> 00:24:28.244
Patient Song Jae Joon. Are you ready?

348
00:24:28.404 --> 00:24:30.474
We'll transfer you to the operating room.

349
00:24:31.315 --> 00:24:34.144
- Pardon me, sir. - Let's go.

350
00:24:46.424 --> 00:24:49.565
(Operating Room)

351
00:24:51.035 --> 00:24:52.565
Please take care of him.

352
00:24:54.934 --> 00:24:56.035
Let's go.

353
00:24:56.035 --> 00:24:57.904
Stay strong, Dad.

354
00:24:57.904 --> 00:24:59.404
Do well, okay?

355
00:24:59.404 --> 00:25:01.275
It's nothing. You can do it.

356
00:25:01.275 --> 00:25:03.305
You can do it. Let's go.

357
00:25:03.305 --> 00:25:05.015
Let's go, Song Jae Joon.

358
00:25:05.214 --> 00:25:07.115
You can do it, Eun Jae.

359
00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:09.015
Stay strong.

360
00:25:33.004 --> 00:25:34.345
Are you scared?

361
00:25:36.375 --> 00:25:38.545
If I tell you I'm not scared,

362
00:25:41.585 --> 00:25:43.015
are you going to believe me?

363
00:25:43.244 --> 00:25:44.984
You don't need to be scared.

364
00:25:46.115 --> 00:25:47.254
I...

365
00:25:48.724 --> 00:25:50.525
I can do this.

366
00:25:54.295 --> 00:25:57.535
It will be all over by the time you wake up.

367
00:26:09.275 --> 00:26:10.575
If...

368
00:26:12.775 --> 00:26:15.885
If, Eun Jae...

369
00:26:16.855 --> 00:26:18.754
If...

370
00:26:20.015 --> 00:26:22.454
Even if something goes wrong,

371
00:26:27.595 --> 00:26:29.494
it's not your fault.

372
00:26:32.295 --> 00:26:33.765
It's not...

373
00:26:34.704 --> 00:26:36.404
your fault.

374
00:26:41.805 --> 00:26:43.375
Do you understand?

375
00:26:46.674 --> 00:26:48.785
Why don't you answer me?

376
00:26:51.015 --> 00:26:52.984
Answer me.

377
00:26:54.684 --> 00:26:56.254
Right now.

378
00:27:08.835 --> 00:27:10.504
You look great,

379
00:27:11.704 --> 00:27:13.075
my daughter.

380
00:27:16.644 --> 00:27:18.375
Your mom...

381
00:27:20.315 --> 00:27:21.414
raised...

382
00:27:23.045 --> 00:27:24.484
you...

383
00:27:25.515 --> 00:27:27.325
so well.

384
00:27:38.135 --> 00:27:39.265
Let's go.

385
00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:13.265
Breathe.

386
00:28:15.234 --> 00:28:17.075
It's your father on the table,

387
00:28:17.075 --> 00:28:19.504
but you should just think of him as cadaver.

388
00:28:19.875 --> 00:28:22.204
No, that's not right.

389
00:28:22.444 --> 00:28:24.744
You shouldn't think that he's not human.

390
00:28:25.015 --> 00:28:26.474
Doctor Kim.

391
00:28:26.984 --> 00:28:28.244
Which side is it?

392
00:28:29.115 --> 00:28:30.355
What are you doing here?

393
00:28:30.885 --> 00:28:33.285
What do you think? I'm here to assist you.

394
00:28:34.855 --> 00:28:36.254
Take it.

395
00:28:53.204 --> 00:28:54.875
I'm not too late, right?

396
00:28:55.144 --> 00:28:58.244
Why are you here?

397
00:28:59.674 --> 00:29:02.085
You should have called me earlier.

398
00:29:02.144 --> 00:29:04.214
I was frying vegetable pancakes when I heard,

399
00:29:04.214 --> 00:29:06.214
so I left the pancakes and came all the way here.

400
00:29:06.385 --> 00:29:08.424
Let's go, Doctor Song.

401
00:29:16.424 --> 00:29:17.734
Hurry up,

402
00:29:17.734 --> 00:29:20.535
or others will take your place.

403
00:29:20.535 --> 00:29:22.135
Gosh.

404
00:29:44.836 --> 00:29:46.736
(Episode 24 will air shortly.)
