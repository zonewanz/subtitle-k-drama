2
00:00:10.124 --> 00:00:12.718
(Class Motto:
Lose Your Mind, Follow Your Instinct)

3
00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:17.976
Wow, time flies!

4
00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:26.851
Time or whatever, do you know
what today is?

5
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.046
(Confused)

6
00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.710
Hee-chul's still not here?

7
00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:31.851
- Not yet.
- Everyone's too lax.

8
00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:33.734
Lee Sang-min!

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.289
What is today? Cue!

10
00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:39.718
"I prepared an event to celebrate today"

11
00:00:39.742 --> 00:00:42.718
"It's our 100th episode since
we first met!"

12
00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:46.695
(Ask Us Anything's 100th Episode!)

13
00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:48.554
100th episode swag!

14
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:51.226
It's our 100th episode today!

15
00:00:51.258 --> 00:00:52.523
That's right!

16
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.726
It's already the 100th episode!

17
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.117
- It's been more than 2 years.
- What was the most memorable?

18
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.375
For the past 100 episodes?
Well, actually...

19
00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:02.523
They almost canceled us by our
7th episode.

20
00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:05.500
(Terrifying moment of crisis)

21
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:08.820
People say it brings good luck if you
dream of poop.

22
00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:10.436
Or if you step on poop.

23
00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:13.242
Jang-hoon pooped on our first episode!

24
00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.406
- Really?
- Yes! It's true!

25
00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:18.976
(Episode 1: "A Man's Pride"
Holding their pee)

26
00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:25.718
If I don't go pee now, I'm gonna
have diarrhea.

27
00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:27.718
I really have to go.

28
00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:29.296
I'm serious.

29
00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:31.515
I'm sorry, but...

30
00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:33.187
Can you guys leave for a bit?

31
00:01:33.258 --> 00:01:35.570
(Took care of big business)

32
00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:37.320
I'm becoming a comedian.

33
00:01:37.353 --> 00:01:39.421
(Providing fertilizer for the show)

34
00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:41.359
Wow, you did all sorts of things.

35
00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.125
And the duck boat on Han River.

36
00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:45.937
(Waking up your sense in
extreme situations)

37
00:01:45.962 --> 00:01:48.625
I've never gotten on this duck boat
with my girlfriend before!

38
00:01:49.593 --> 00:01:51.148
Give my next mission!

39
00:01:51.543 --> 00:01:54.437
(They had to go through various
missions to solve problems)

40
00:01:54.703 --> 00:01:57.695
When I saw Kyung-hoon for the first time
in Han River,

41
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.492
I told him his band's too old.

42
00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:02.796
You're not as popular as back then.

43
00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:06.023
(Upset at his first appearance)

44
00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:08.617
Buzz, your band? That was so long ago.

45
00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:12.070
(20,000 Buzz fans got mad at him)

46
00:02:12.918 --> 00:02:15.187
I got in a lot of trouble for that.

47
00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:17.546
(Kyung-hoon got to see how much
his fans love him)

48
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.882
That's when Jang-hoon decidedly became
Kyung-hoon's mom.

49
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:25.882
Yeah, Jang-hoon started to take really
good care of me since then.

50
00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:28.343
(His fans made them father and son)

51
00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:31.671
If you said something like that now, you'd
have to live out in the jungle.

52
00:02:33.514 --> 00:02:35.476
You'll be King Kong then!

53
00:02:36.993 --> 00:02:39.468
As he keep pounding his chest.

54
00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:42.164
"Why did I say that?"

55
00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:44.945
(A lonely King Kong, full of regret)

56
00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:46.632
We're family now.

57
00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:50.421
Buzz fans love me very much too, by now.

58
00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.539
Yeong-cheol makes me feel sad though.

59
00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:55.929
He did so much on our first episode.

60
00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.101
He really carried the show
in the beginning.

61
00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:00.195
(Embarrassed)

62
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.548
(During a skit in Episode 1)

63
00:03:06.844 --> 00:03:09.789
(He grabbed Hee-chul's hair,
unthinkable in today's mood)

64
00:03:10.477 --> 00:03:12.539
(Getting slapped in all kinds of ways
in Episode 6)

65
00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.289
(A heavy slap with thick sausage)

66
00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:23.953
(Yeong-cheol gave big laughs
by sacrificing his body)

67
00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:26.812
But that fame didn't continue on.

68
00:03:27.502 --> 00:03:29.765
Why are you talking about the past?

69
00:03:29.797 --> 00:03:33.601
Don't be so mean, I'm sure he's
loved in his own family.

70
00:03:33.777 --> 00:03:34.929
I am!

71
00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:39.257
He's right! And I can't talk so well
when I feel self-conscious.

72
00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:43.593
We're so thankful that we lasted
this long to do our 100th episode.

73
00:03:43.602 --> 00:03:45.312
We went through some rough times.

74
00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:48.398
You think we got here because of your
quick remarks, Soo-geun?

75
00:03:48.422 --> 00:03:52.382
- I didn't say anything...
- It's because of the viewers' love for us!

76
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:57.453
And I was told that we had 120 guest
students for those past 100 episodes.

77
00:03:58.598 --> 00:04:02.039
It's all because of them that we got
to last this long.

78
00:04:02.064 --> 00:04:05.242
- I'm very thankful.
- We should be, with all sincerity.

79
00:04:07.188 --> 00:04:08.710
What's this?

80
00:04:09.387 --> 00:04:12.000
I was waiting in the back, you guys
talk so much!

81
00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:14.031
(He came through the front door today!)

82
00:04:14.047 --> 00:04:15.468
You're late!

83
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.718
Wow, it feels so awkward to stand here.

84
00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:19.937
Why are you wearing white today?

85
00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.585
I brought some friends of mine today.

86
00:04:22.609 --> 00:04:26.733
But they're too scared of Ho-dong that
they don't want to come in.

87
00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:28.468
I barely got them to feel safe.

88
00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:30.975
OK, come in!

89
00:04:31.703 --> 00:04:33.452
(Noisy)

90
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.671
Hurry up!

91
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:38.772
- It's OK!
- Come in.

92
00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:41.288
(Everyone looks)

93
00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:45.663
(Ye-sung is dragged in)

94
00:04:46.184 --> 00:04:49.343
(The idol-group Super Junior!)

95
00:04:49.724 --> 00:04:51.428
How've you been ,Ye-sung?

96
00:04:51.522 --> 00:04:52.343
Oh yes, I have.

97
00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:54.069
Ye-sung, you're my baby!

98
00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.935
You're not supposed to use honorifics here.

99
00:04:57.421 --> 00:04:59.671
(Ye-sung looks a bit uncomfortable)

100
00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:02.337
(And Ho-dong welcomes with much enthusiasm)

101
00:05:02.504 --> 00:05:05.968
A few of my members felt like you were
stalking them, they hated it.

102
00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:07.405
- Must be so stressful.
- Yes.

103
00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:09.296
- Name one, who?
- Ye-sung.

104
00:05:09.312 --> 00:05:10.912
Ye-sung.

105
00:05:12.622 --> 00:05:15.489
You really gave me a name!
It was Ye-sung?

106
00:05:15.998 --> 00:05:17.514
(Feel betrayed)

107
00:05:17.562 --> 00:05:20.304
Ye-sung? The one that sings well?

108
00:05:20.343 --> 00:05:22.804
He said he can't go on a TV show
with you anymore.

109
00:05:22.827 --> 00:05:25.241
He got really stressed out!

110
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.038
They're victims of Ho-dong.

111
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.264
- Really?
- Why?

112
00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:31.374
You don't understand how close Ye-sung
and I are.

113
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.507
He can't even look you in the eyes.

114
00:05:33.546 --> 00:05:35.725
You should say hello properly.

115
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.132
He covered his eyes with his hair
because he's so scared.

116
00:05:38.156 --> 00:05:39.936
He's so stiff1

117
00:05:40.126 --> 00:05:42.952
Why are you so scared of Ho-dong?

118
00:05:43.014 --> 00:05:45.077
Don't get scared, don't get scared!

119
00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:49.647
Let's continue on with this mode, let's not
reveal to them that we're actually close.

120
00:05:49.734 --> 00:05:51.952
Until the end, OK? Don't loosen up.

121
00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:53.233
Yes...

122
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:55.554
(We're only pretending to be awkward
with each other!)

123
00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:57.546
Don't use honorifics here!

124
00:05:57.862 --> 00:05:59.460
(Feeling shy)

125
00:05:59.561 --> 00:06:01.944
Ye-sung, don't be scared.
I'll protect you today.

126
00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:02.913
OK.

127
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.436
(Feels comforted)

128
00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.874
Introduce yourselves first.

129
00:06:06.984 --> 00:06:09.100
We're the original idol-group to be
TV show hosts.

130
00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:12.671
And we've returned to our original career
as singers for the first time in 2 years.

131
00:06:12.702 --> 00:06:15.100
We are Super Junior!

132
00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:17.046
(Welcome!)

133
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:18.624
(Awkward)

134
00:06:18.742 --> 00:06:20.616
Hee-chul, why are you being so modest?

135
00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:22.335
(Looking shy and proper)

136
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.250
You feel awkward, right?

137
00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:26.796
I felt more comfortable in that seat.

138
00:06:26.827 --> 00:06:28.679
Can everyone pay attention?

139
00:06:28.734 --> 00:06:30.155
Let me introduce myself.

140
00:06:30.187 --> 00:06:32.741
I'm the leader of Super Junior.

141
00:06:32.772 --> 00:06:35.232
I'm also the leader of "Attention-Seeker
Association."

142
00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.483
I'm an attention-seeker,
Lee Teuk.

143
00:06:38.194 --> 00:06:40.491
"Attention-Seeker Association"?

144
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:44.061
I ask for your constant love and care!

145
00:06:44.482 --> 00:06:46.218
OK, got it.

146
00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:49.702
Can I also get a camera designated
for myself?

147
00:06:49.734 --> 00:06:51.280
You need your own camera?

148
00:06:51.564 --> 00:06:53.164
Next!

149
00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:55.147
I'll introduce myself.

150
00:06:55.265 --> 00:06:57.436
I'm in charge of being the handsome and
self-radiant one.

151
00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:00.154
I'm Eun-hyuk, the Dancing Machine.

152
00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:02.085
Do it again.

153
00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:04.061
Sorry about that.

154
00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:06.905
I'm Eun-hyuk, the anchovy-looking member.

155
00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:08.382
Hey, do it better!

156
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:09.718
The anchovy...

157
00:07:09.743 --> 00:07:11.897
- Are you nervous?
- No I'm not.

158
00:07:11.984 --> 00:07:14.030
- He is!
- But Eun-hyuk...

159
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.155
You said earlier that you're
"self-radiant."

160
00:07:18.586 --> 00:07:20.734
And an anchovy is also shiny, it's
silver all around!

161
00:07:20.757 --> 00:07:22.780
- Both descriptions are fit you well.
- Thanks.

162
00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:25.491
He's helping me with my introduction.

163
00:07:26.347 --> 00:07:29.265
If Kyung-hoon's the one who's helping you,
your comments must be that frustrating.

164
00:07:29.423 --> 00:07:30.968
(You think so?)

165
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.390
If you're "the Dancing Machine," you should
show us your dance without any music!

166
00:07:35.523 --> 00:07:37.694
Show us! Don't leave us in suspense!

167
00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:39.366
(Dance time for the handsome and
self-radiant one)

168
00:07:39.413 --> 00:07:41.898
They like big moves, do "the rainbow."

169
00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:44.788
I know the type of dance moves
Ho-dong likes.

170
00:07:44.851 --> 00:07:47.411
You saw the episode with Yun-ho?
You have to do some pop-locking.

171
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.148
Pop-locking works the best here, like
Kim Jung-Nam from Turbo.

172
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.827
(With lots of force)

173
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.374
(A clean finish)

174
00:08:00.926 --> 00:08:02.976
(He likes it!)

175
00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:05.765
I know Ho-dong likes this style of dance.

176
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.944
Isn't that cool?

177
00:08:06.976 --> 00:08:09.780
I changed my dance style especially
for him.

178
00:08:10.132 --> 00:08:14.804
I'm in charge of being "Dong-hae" in
Super Junior, I'm Dong-hae.

179
00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:17.882
If you're charge of Dong-hae [east sea],
who's in charge of other seas?

180
00:08:17.907 --> 00:08:19.640
(Appalled at his bad joke)

181
00:08:19.687 --> 00:08:23.679
My dermatologist asked me to tell you
that you still owe him money for treatment.

182
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.460
(Is this for real?)

183
00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:30.015
Tell him I'll send payment over
by this week.

184
00:08:30.213 --> 00:08:32.694
Why are you mentioning that here?

185
00:08:32.843 --> 00:08:34.983
You see a dermatologist?

186
00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.288
Why are you blushing?

187
00:08:38.486 --> 00:08:40.976
You should pay your doctors!

188
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.460
I do!

189
00:08:42.485 --> 00:08:44.925
What happens if you don't get professional
care for your skin?

190
00:08:45.336 --> 00:08:47.366
My face gets totally messed up.

191
00:08:47.867 --> 00:08:49.648
I'm shocked that he goes to a
dermatologist.

192
00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:53.757
- Tell him by this week.
- OK, he asked me to tell you.

193
00:08:53.928 --> 00:08:57.538
When we were new, Dong-hae went on
a TV show called "Love Letter."

194
00:08:57.585 --> 00:09:02.812
He told me after that he was cracking jokes
on Ho-dong, but Ho-dong didn't respond.

195
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:05.624
In the end, Ho-dong just said, "It was fun
today," then left.

196
00:09:05.921 --> 00:09:07.827
(I did?)

197
00:09:08.107 --> 00:09:12.701
I told myself that I'd never go on
a funny TV show since then.

198
00:09:12.804 --> 00:09:14.404
(Determined)

199
00:09:14.578 --> 00:09:16.460
Ho-dong destroyed many people.

200
00:09:16.492 --> 00:09:19.202
So Ho-dong just ignored you the whole time.

201
00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:20.749
He didn't even respond.

202
00:09:21.382 --> 00:09:23.530
Oh, did I, really?

203
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.554
I went on that show too, in 2005.

204
00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:29.085
- What happened then?
- He ignored me too.

205
00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:32.710
I know how you feel, Dong-hae.

206
00:09:32.735 --> 00:09:35.046
Dong-hae, you really shouldn't
be like that.

207
00:09:35.086 --> 00:09:38.085
I thought we had a heart-to-heart
friendship.

208
00:09:39.205 --> 00:09:41.304
But he's got a very small heart.

209
00:09:43.848 --> 00:09:45.608
We're "Ho-Dong-hae"!

210
00:09:47.768 --> 00:09:49.304
Actually...

211
00:09:49.329 --> 00:09:51.921
I'm really thankful for Ho-dong
for one thing.

212
00:09:52.062 --> 00:09:53.687
You don't have to mention it.

213
00:09:53.711 --> 00:09:55.991
I was on "Star King" for the first time
in 6 years.

214
00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.280
And as he was taking off his microphone
after the show,

215
00:09:58.297 --> 00:10:00.758
he said, "Good job today," and left.

216
00:10:00.783 --> 00:10:02.194
I was really touched by it.

217
00:10:02.211 --> 00:10:03.890
By what he said?

218
00:10:03.922 --> 00:10:06.319
I was complimented for the first time
in 6 years.

219
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.804
6 years?

220
00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:09.632
It took too long.

221
00:10:09.672 --> 00:10:12.132
I go on funny TV shows once
every 6 years.

222
00:10:12.148 --> 00:10:14.366
And this is my first TV show appearance
in 6 years since then.

223
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.608
(His 3rd TV appearance is with
Ho-dong again)

224
00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:21.124
(We'll get to see Dong-hae on TV show
after 6 years from today)

225
00:10:21.164 --> 00:10:23.468
Dong-hae didn't know this because
he was too young then,

226
00:10:23.476 --> 00:10:27.124
but you should've paid him 30,000 dollars
when you met Ho-dong first.

227
00:10:27.164 --> 00:10:29.241
(A deposit to make others funny on TV)

228
00:10:29.297 --> 00:10:33.780
It took Ho-dong 6 years to be nice to you
because you didn't give him any money.

229
00:10:34.117 --> 00:10:35.812
I take bribes now.

230
00:10:36.273 --> 00:10:37.749
(Playing it off)

231
00:10:37.765 --> 00:10:39.718
I was so thankful that you told me that.

232
00:10:39.797 --> 00:10:42.257
So we'll see you in 2023?

233
00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:45.382
I plan to go on "Let's Eat
Dinner Together" in 6 years.

234
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:47.671
I'll hold on to the show until then.

235
00:10:47.696 --> 00:10:50.413
You did a great job with your
introduction!

236
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:53.390
(Pulling something out)

237
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.116
I'll give you another 30,000 dollars later.

238
00:10:58.336 --> 00:11:00.140
You know him very well, right?

239
00:11:00.165 --> 00:11:01.788
He came from North Korea.

240
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.560
(Looking similar)

241
00:11:03.593 --> 00:11:05.413
Let's give him an applause first.

242
00:11:05.438 --> 00:11:06.953
(A North-Korean style welcome)

243
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:08.601
Why do I have to do this?

244
00:11:08.648 --> 00:11:12.999
I'm in charge of being "Kang Ho-dong"
of Super Junior.

245
00:11:13.024 --> 00:11:16.289
I'm the knock-off Ho-dong,
Shin Dong!

246
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.929
(A memorable self-introduction)

247
00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:21.752
If Kang Ho-dong's too expensive,
come find me, "Shin Ho-dong."

248
00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:23.739
(That's good!)

249
00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:26.843
(Finally, Ye-sung's turn is next)

250
00:11:27.332 --> 00:11:28.413
Brighten your face!

251
00:11:28.445 --> 00:11:30.015
We're here because of you!

252
00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:32.015
(Already nervous)

253
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.640
He's from Cheonan, born on August
24, 1983.

254
00:11:35.664 --> 00:11:37.101
It's 1984.

255
00:11:37.132 --> 00:11:38.624
Yes!

256
00:11:38.672 --> 00:11:40.211
And his real name is Kim Jong-un.

257
00:11:40.218 --> 00:11:41.569
Introduce yourself.

258
00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:43.718
Your brother's name is Kim Jong-Jin.

259
00:11:45.563 --> 00:11:47.796
(Showing off)

260
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.757
He looked you up already.

261
00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:52.640
The artistic vocal cords, Ye-sung!

262
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.804
My brother and my baby!

263
00:11:55.299 --> 00:11:57.023
(Feeling pressured)

264
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.562
He looked this up 10 minutes before
he came in here.

265
00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:02.944
No, I knew that already.

266
00:12:02.969 --> 00:12:06.655
It's nice to meet you, I was born in 1984.

267
00:12:06.711 --> 00:12:08.023
My real name is Kim Jong-un.

268
00:12:08.048 --> 00:12:10.616
I'm the lead vocalist in the team.

269
00:12:10.656 --> 00:12:12.757
I think I'm in charge of being the
good-looking one, too.

270
00:12:12.781 --> 00:12:14.733
I think he's got an indigestion problem.

271
00:12:14.997 --> 00:12:16.757
(Looking pale)

272
00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:19.679
It's true, he looks so pale!

273
00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:22.390
What are you in charge of? Being
the good-looking one?

274
00:12:22.461 --> 00:12:24.562
Being good-looking.

275
00:12:24.617 --> 00:12:28.077
I thought he said he was in charge of
taking notes. [pun]

276
00:12:28.109 --> 00:12:29.819
I thought his job was to take notes.

277
00:12:30.878 --> 00:12:33.773
(While all the members are laughing
at Jang-hoon's misunderstanding)

278
00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:36.069
(Ye-sung's serious on his own)

279
00:12:36.226 --> 00:12:39.101
I had no idea I'd come on this show.

280
00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:43.507
I'd avoid going through Cheon-ho-dong
because it sounds like Ho-dong.

281
00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:45.131
I'd get scared.

282
00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:49.257
Cheon-ho-dong? Why?

283
00:12:49.327 --> 00:12:51.038
Isn't that too much?

284
00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:52.898
How about Geum-ho-dong?

285
00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:56.155
(Taken aback at his sudden question)

286
00:12:56.187 --> 00:12:58.116
That can be dangerous too.

287
00:12:58.141 --> 00:13:00.796
I'd like to get over my bad memory
of Ho-dong from the past.

288
00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:03.257
I came on the show to make peace.
Hope you treat me nicely.

289
00:13:03.273 --> 00:13:05.546
What really happened between you two?

290
00:13:05.578 --> 00:13:08.937
What really happened? We're so curious.

291
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.241
They're making it seem like something
happened between us.

292
00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:14.476
They're getting everyone's attention
their way.

293
00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:16.577
How clever!

294
00:13:16.624 --> 00:13:18.702
That's how you work TV shows.

295
00:13:18.727 --> 00:13:19.741
(Appreciated)

296
00:13:19.797 --> 00:13:21.296
You're really my baby.

297
00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:23.921
(Mood gets warmer all of a sudden)

298
00:13:24.757 --> 00:13:26.780
I went to your coffee shop in Yeouido often.

299
00:13:27.054 --> 00:13:28.624
Your mother didn't say anything?

300
00:13:28.671 --> 00:13:31.663
It's been 5 years since we moved
to a different part of town.

301
00:13:32.162 --> 00:13:34.062
(You moved 5 years ago?)

302
00:13:34.849 --> 00:13:36.624
(Feeling sad)

303
00:13:38.215 --> 00:13:39.687
(He's embarrassed himself)

304
00:13:39.712 --> 00:13:41.718
It's just over that bridge, right?

305
00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:45.671
Ye-sung, we're seeing a bad example
of looking up stuff on the Internet.

306
00:13:45.696 --> 00:13:47.718
(Got nothing to say)

307
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.374
You should've checked the dates too.

308
00:13:50.982 --> 00:13:52.624
(He wasn't thorough enough)

309
00:13:52.664 --> 00:13:54.773
He doesn't know a whole lot.

310
00:13:54.851 --> 00:13:59.960
Their album did come out, but Super Junior
is not here just to promote their album.

311
00:14:00.015 --> 00:14:02.187
They came with a sincere heart.

312
00:14:02.328 --> 00:14:06.109
- Super Junior doesn't need PR.
- They would've dressed in black suits.

313
00:14:06.684 --> 00:14:07.913
(Everyone's amazed)

314
00:14:09.507 --> 00:14:10.812
(You know my heart, right?)

315
00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:13.194
He means to count money.

316
00:14:13.902 --> 00:14:15.757
30,000 dollars!

317
00:14:15.824 --> 00:14:19.538
His real name is Kang Si-hoo,
make sure you transfer it right.

318
00:14:21.192 --> 00:14:23.265
(Make your deposit without a mistake)

319
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:25.484
Account holder: Kang Si-hoo.

320
00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:28.921
Don't talk about my son! You're using
my son's name to be funny?

321
00:14:29.007 --> 00:14:30.554
He'd like it.

322
00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:32.986
He would, actually, though he doesn't
know what it means.

323
00:14:33.031 --> 00:14:35.648
His wife takes care of money
in the household.

324
00:14:35.687 --> 00:14:39.194
Shin Dong has a way of telling the future.

325
00:14:39.703 --> 00:14:42.663
He said Yeong-cheol will go overseas
and it came true!

326
00:14:42.867 --> 00:14:45.405
It came true exactly as Shin Dong said it.

327
00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:49.257
(Yeong-cheol really got to go to Germany
after Shin Dong's prophecy)

328
00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:52.538
- I got to go to Germany.
- You really want to work overseas?

329
00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:55.076
I'd like to, I have my profile ready.

330
00:14:55.241 --> 00:14:57.288
Before you do that...

331
00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.195
You need to pay the dermatologist first.

332
00:14:59.462 --> 00:15:02.124
(So funny!)

333
00:15:02.878 --> 00:15:05.077
I'll take care of it!

334
00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:07.155
If someone provided service...

335
00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:09.132
What did he tell you?

336
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.718
Dong-hae made people laugh twice
in the opening, he's looking better.

337
00:15:12.962 --> 00:15:15.046
(Looking bright)

338
00:15:16.474 --> 00:15:18.702
Why did you pick me as a target?

339
00:15:18.797 --> 00:15:21.819
Teuk, you seem a little darker, actually.

340
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.546
It's because he's not getting enough
attention from people.

341
00:15:24.571 --> 00:15:25.804
What can we do for you?

342
00:15:25.812 --> 00:15:27.937
Just keep talking to me.

343
00:15:28.249 --> 00:15:30.101
A leader should be reserved.

344
00:15:30.406 --> 00:15:32.562
This isn't what I had in mind.

345
00:15:33.044 --> 00:15:34.991
Can we start over? From the beginning?

346
00:15:35.015 --> 00:15:36.944
I think we started on the wrong foot.

347
00:15:36.984 --> 00:15:39.507
No, Dong-hae already made everyone
laugh twice.

348
00:15:39.677 --> 00:15:41.277
(That's right!)

349
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.069
(You're the best, Soo-geun!)

350
00:15:46.235 --> 00:15:48.687
Dong-hae's definitely feeling satisfied.

351
00:15:48.898 --> 00:15:50.687
I think I did enough for the first half.

352
00:15:50.726 --> 00:15:52.326
You definitely did.

353
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.702
Ye-sung, act a little more upset.
A little more.

354
00:15:54.718 --> 00:15:55.905
A little more scared.

355
00:15:55.976 --> 00:15:57.655
(Ah... Sure...)

356
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.335
- Let's not get caught that we're close!
- Sorry?

357
00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:03.023
Don't show that we're actually
close friends.

358
00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:05.710
Anyone can tell you're not close!

359
00:16:05.906 --> 00:16:07.839
Can I go to the bathroom now?

360
00:16:08.732 --> 00:16:10.843
Can't you tell it's not the time for it?

361
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.710
(Ah...)

362
00:16:14.902 --> 00:16:17.694
The mood came your way, just
leak it little by little.

363
00:16:17.998 --> 00:16:19.202
(Little by little...)

364
00:16:19.233 --> 00:16:21.734
But Hee-chul, are you just gonna
stand there the whole time?

365
00:16:21.757 --> 00:16:23.890
No, we have to choose our partners.

366
00:16:23.976 --> 00:16:25.569
(Choosing Super Junior's partners)

367
00:16:25.624 --> 00:16:28.194
You already wrote down whom you'd
like to sit next to.

368
00:16:28.203 --> 00:16:31.116
Not much to look at, 90% of you
wrote Yeong-cheol.

369
00:16:31.164 --> 00:16:32.554
Wow, really? To be my partner?

370
00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:34.546
Lee Teuk: Kim Yeong-cheol.

371
00:16:35.109 --> 00:16:36.734
So I can look better in comparison.

372
00:16:37.225 --> 00:16:39.241
Shin Dong: Kim Yeong-cheol.

373
00:16:39.304 --> 00:16:41.085
He got to go overseas because of me.

374
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:43.398
Eun-hyuk also picked Yeong-cheol.

375
00:16:43.423 --> 00:16:44.187
Why me?

376
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:46.444
So I can seem funnier in comparison.

377
00:16:46.499 --> 00:16:48.421
Everyone's trying to use me!

378
00:16:49.609 --> 00:16:52.351
Dong-hae's more realistic, he put
Seo Jang-hoon.

379
00:16:52.398 --> 00:16:56.265
"Because he seems to be the most
popular one these days."

380
00:16:56.713 --> 00:16:59.671
(Dong-hae knows what's up)

381
00:17:00.297 --> 00:17:03.609
Hee-chul wrote something deep
from his heart.

382
00:17:03.664 --> 00:17:06.257
He put Kim Yeong-cheol with all sincerity.

383
00:17:06.312 --> 00:17:11.585
"I'm originally a student here, so my part
will be skipped over mostly today."

384
00:17:11.632 --> 00:17:13.468
"But other members shouldn't
have to suffer."

385
00:17:13.745 --> 00:17:16.405
(Sacrificing so other Super Junior
members can have more parts)

386
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.030
Most of what I say do get aired these days.

387
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:24.444
Ye-sung wrote something vague, hard
to tell whom he means.

388
00:17:25.218 --> 00:17:27.733
Ye-sung said, "Anyone but Ho-dong."

389
00:17:31.628 --> 00:17:32.819
He's good at this.

390
00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:34.335
It looks like he means it, right?

391
00:17:34.359 --> 00:17:36.312
Too many people want Yeong-cheol.

392
00:17:36.336 --> 00:17:38.069
Dong-hae's partner is set.

393
00:17:39.437 --> 00:17:42.640
(Jang-hoon and Dong-hae are
partners today!)

394
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.468
Dong-hae's already set, so make a poem
with my name.

395
00:17:49.852 --> 00:17:51.593
(Yeong-cheol's mission for them:
Make a poem with his name)

396
00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:53.366
Shin Dong first.

397
00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:54.257
"Kim"!

398
00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:55.882
Don't say things that are so flat. [pun]

399
00:17:55.898 --> 00:17:57.498
Shin Dong first.

400
00:17:57.711 --> 00:17:58.523
"Kim"!

401
00:17:58.539 --> 00:18:01.206
Don't say things that are so flat. [pun]

402
00:18:01.218 --> 00:18:01.851
"Yeong"!

403
00:18:01.875 --> 00:18:03.804
Nothing lasts forever. [pun]

404
00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:04.390
"Cheol"!

405
00:18:04.429 --> 00:18:05.796
You're so immature. [pun]

406
00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:07.584
(An unexpected twist)

407
00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:12.679
Not bad, right?

408
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:15.507
(Definitely to their liking)

409
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:18.812
Ye-sung needs to do it too.
He said "anyone but Ho-dong."

410
00:18:18.882 --> 00:18:21.694
Make a poem with Kang Ho-dong's name.

411
00:18:21.718 --> 00:18:22.444
Too much pressure.

412
00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:25.819
He was thinking of Kim Yeong-cheol
this whole time!

413
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.335
(Confused)

414
00:18:29.578 --> 00:18:30.788
"Kang"!

415
00:18:32.086 --> 00:18:34.155
A strong man. [pun]

416
00:18:34.507 --> 00:18:35.679
"Ho"!

417
00:18:35.734 --> 00:18:37.585
Ho-dong has...

418
00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:39.734
"Dong"!

419
00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:43.921
No sympathy. [pun]

420
00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:48.437
(What are you saying?)

421
00:18:48.834 --> 00:18:50.499
(A realistic poem without being funny)

422
00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:52.421
That was too serious!

423
00:18:53.774 --> 00:18:55.757
Should I do it again?

424
00:18:56.992 --> 00:18:58.925
It was from his heart though.

425
00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:01.429
Yeong-cheol, did you pick one?

426
00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:03.882
"Immature"! Shin Dong!

427
00:19:03.907 --> 00:19:07.007
(Shin Dong and Yeong-cheol are partners!)

428
00:19:07.809 --> 00:19:10.616
(The remaining members need to pick
new partners)

429
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.062
Then for me...

430
00:19:12.101 --> 00:19:14.054
I'll sit next to Sang-min.

431
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.554
I gotta go with the current flow,
he's popular these days.

432
00:19:17.952 --> 00:19:22.030
He's only popular in the other show,
not much going on here.

433
00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:25.851
I came in high expectations, but he's
not talking much today.

434
00:19:25.906 --> 00:19:27.609
I talked a lot today.

435
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.859
He talks to himself all the time here.

436
00:19:32.933 --> 00:19:36.366
(Lee Teuk and Sang-min are partners!)

437
00:19:37.628 --> 00:19:38.991
I pick Kyung-hoon.

438
00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:42.671
(Eun-hyuk and Kyung-hoon are partners!)

439
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.929
You know what Ye-sung just told me?

440
00:19:45.961 --> 00:19:48.554
"Please let me live, don't send me
to Ho-dong!"

441
00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:51.468
(Only Ho-dong and Soo-geun remain)

442
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.640
How about you, Hee-chul?

443
00:19:54.304 --> 00:19:57.507
I have to grant Ye-sung his wish.

444
00:19:58.072 --> 00:19:59.976
Ye-sung will sit here.

445
00:20:02.056 --> 00:20:04.382
(Welcome to Ho-dong!)

446
00:20:05.134 --> 00:20:06.499
My baby, come here!

447
00:20:08.968 --> 00:20:10.780
(Come on)

448
00:20:11.567 --> 00:20:13.460
(Treating him like a real baby)

449
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.655
Hold on.

450
00:20:20.955 --> 00:20:22.452
Your bone is shaped funny.

451
00:20:23.128 --> 00:20:24.194
It poked my thigh.

452
00:20:24.218 --> 00:20:25.749
I apologize.

453
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.952
(Apologizes right away)

454
00:20:28.922 --> 00:20:29.952
(Serious)

455
00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:33.671
(Ye-sung still feels so far from Ho-dong)

456
00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:35.991
Who goes up first for the quiz?

457
00:20:36.576 --> 00:20:38.765
Eun-hyuk starts it off!

458
00:20:39.117 --> 00:20:41.398
I feel pressured that I keep going
up first.

459
00:20:41.423 --> 00:20:43.601
They said his questions are funny.

460
00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:46.173
(Hm?)

461
00:20:48.974 --> 00:20:51.937
(Countdown to make us laugh!)

462
00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:56.030
(Guess who I am Quiz)

463
00:20:56.218 --> 00:20:59.218
The first question! Hot off the stove!

464
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.726
Really hot off the stove!

465
00:21:02.772 --> 00:21:04.148
(He definitely feels pressured)

466
00:21:04.173 --> 00:21:08.585
I went over to Dong-hae's house
last week.

467
00:21:08.648 --> 00:21:12.898
And I was really shocked by something.
What do you think happened?

468
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.124
He had a woman hiding in his house.

469
00:21:15.257 --> 00:21:16.991
(Of course it's wrong)

470
00:21:17.061 --> 00:21:20.163
You went to his house, and he was asleep.

471
00:21:20.195 --> 00:21:22.054
But he was sleeping naked!

472
00:21:22.124 --> 00:21:26.772
And you saw that he was so "healthy,"
you were shocked.

473
00:21:27.298 --> 00:21:28.819
Why should I be shocked that he's healthy?

474
00:21:28.836 --> 00:21:30.343
You would be!

475
00:21:30.359 --> 00:21:32.273
You think he knows the password
to my door lock?

476
00:21:32.335 --> 00:21:35.257
(First time knowing how healthy he is
in 12 years)

477
00:21:37.894 --> 00:21:39.468
He's not that healthy.

478
00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:41.179
(Really?)

479
00:21:41.625 --> 00:21:42.437
I got it!

480
00:21:42.491 --> 00:21:45.873
You went to his house, and the door opened
before you were about to open it.

481
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:49.273
Then a woman walked out saying, "I'll
take out the trash, Dong-hae!"

482
00:21:50.203 --> 00:21:52.734
(A mysterious woman in his house)

483
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.335
Then she took out the trash.

484
00:21:54.367 --> 00:21:56.616
Eun-hyuk saw her, then said

485
00:21:56.672 --> 00:21:59.116
"Honey, what are you doing here?"

486
00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:01.249
You guys are crazy!

487
00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:04.411
Then she got in Shin Dong's car
and left.

488
00:22:05.097 --> 00:22:07.429
(Feeling proud for some reason)

489
00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:10.437
(Hee-chul's coming back to life)

490
00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:13.741
First of all, it's not about women.

491
00:22:13.882 --> 00:22:15.398
Is it about men?

492
00:22:15.444 --> 00:22:18.444
You went to Dong-hae's house, and saw
a guy.

493
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.382
"Oppa!"

494
00:22:21.233 --> 00:22:22.687
I got it!

495
00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:25.609
You went to his house, and on his bed,

496
00:22:25.632 --> 00:22:29.382
there was Shin Dong in bed with Dong-hae.

497
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:33.007
I didn't say anything!

498
00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:38.890
You went to his house and saw that his
house was near the west sea, not the east.

499
00:22:38.929 --> 00:22:39.780
(Too much!)

500
00:22:39.805 --> 00:22:41.155
I want a new partner!

501
00:22:41.588 --> 00:22:44.077
No, this is where you should be.

502
00:22:44.477 --> 00:22:46.249
(Regretful)

503
00:22:46.507 --> 00:22:47.609
Hint!

504
00:22:47.625 --> 00:22:51.194
He told me to do something.

505
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.507
And I was shocked to hear it.

506
00:22:54.679 --> 00:22:56.788
I know your feet smell, so...

507
00:22:57.039 --> 00:22:58.898
(What are you talking about?)

508
00:22:58.906 --> 00:23:01.476
He told you to wash your feet before.

509
00:23:02.023 --> 00:23:02.929
No, no.

510
00:23:02.968 --> 00:23:04.171
It's not about that.

511
00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:06.343
What was that wrong answer for?

512
00:23:07.554 --> 00:23:08.921
I got it!

513
00:23:08.952 --> 00:23:10.885
You went to Dong-hae's house.

514
00:23:10.898 --> 00:23:12.359
And you had to go to the bathroom.

515
00:23:12.828 --> 00:23:16.546
You had to go, and he stopped you before
you went to the bathroom.

516
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:20.976
Then he said, "You have to get naked
before using the bathroom here."

517
00:23:21.007 --> 00:23:23.351
So yo had to take off all your clothes
before you went.

518
00:23:23.382 --> 00:23:24.968
It was similar!

519
00:23:25.015 --> 00:23:27.382
(Jang-hoon and Ho-dong both
want to answer)

520
00:23:28.623 --> 00:23:29.874
Go ahead.

521
00:23:29.898 --> 00:23:31.898
(Everyone's got a feel for it)

522
00:23:33.382 --> 00:23:37.187
They say your habits from when you were
little last you your life time.

523
00:23:37.265 --> 00:23:40.710
Dong-hae didn't have any toilet paper.
I saw this from before.

524
00:23:40.843 --> 00:23:43.413
So Eun-hyuk grabbed him a toilet paper.

525
00:23:43.461 --> 00:23:46.648
And saw that Dong-hae wasn't
sitting on the toilet seat.

526
00:23:46.656 --> 00:23:49.749
But he had climbed on the toilet bowl.

527
00:23:50.626 --> 00:23:52.132
This is how he was going.

528
00:23:52.157 --> 00:23:53.694
Some people do that!

529
00:23:54.173 --> 00:23:57.234
(Another new habit discovered)

530
00:23:57.995 --> 00:23:59.007
(That's not it)

531
00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.765
That's not it, but...

532
00:24:01.016 --> 00:24:02.609
(Ye-sung wants to answer)

533
00:24:04.545 --> 00:24:05.866
Ye-sung!

534
00:24:07.148 --> 00:24:09.562
You wanted to pee.

535
00:24:09.632 --> 00:24:11.499
But he told you to pee sitting down.

536
00:24:11.586 --> 00:24:13.186
Correct!

537
00:24:15.676 --> 00:24:17.523
(Good job, my baby!)

538
00:24:17.548 --> 00:24:19.312
Nice seat, right?

539
00:24:19.578 --> 00:24:21.304
Why go sitting down?

540
00:24:21.461 --> 00:24:24.937
I really had to go pee, so I was
walking into the bathroom.

541
00:24:24.962 --> 00:24:27.648
He said, "Hold on," and stopped me.

542
00:24:27.726 --> 00:24:30.530
He asked me if I was going to pee.

543
00:24:30.577 --> 00:24:33.874
I said yes, and he said, "Pee
sitting down."

544
00:24:34.926 --> 00:24:36.476
(Can't understand)

545
00:24:36.515 --> 00:24:38.398
I thought he was joking.

546
00:24:38.452 --> 00:24:40.687
"Stop messing around, I have to go."

547
00:24:40.703 --> 00:24:44.718
But he told me again, so seriously
that I need to pee sitting down.

548
00:24:45.485 --> 00:24:47.952
- I go sitting down too.
- Me too.

549
00:24:47.977 --> 00:24:49.319
Don't a lot of people do that?

550
00:24:49.382 --> 00:24:52.554
(Debate over urinating position)

551
00:24:52.727 --> 00:24:56.905
I afraid that it'll splash out. I go
like that too.

552
00:24:56.984 --> 00:25:02.601
I personally give much respect
for Dong-hae's preference.

553
00:25:03.161 --> 00:25:06.812
I go that way when I visit
someone else's house too.

554
00:25:06.843 --> 00:25:09.085
I don't want to make it dirty.

555
00:25:09.132 --> 00:25:09.788
It splashes.

556
00:25:09.812 --> 00:25:12.460
I think it's a matter of control, no?

557
00:25:13.463 --> 00:25:15.155
(No, it's not that)

558
00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.180
If you aim well to the side...

559
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.819
Even if you do that, it splashes
everywhere, unseen in our eyes.

560
00:25:19.843 --> 00:25:21.593
I heard it splashes over 2 meters!

561
00:25:21.656 --> 00:25:23.609
(The standing-up group is losing ground)

562
00:25:23.695 --> 00:25:24.975
You can just clean the bathroom.

563
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.476
You can aim to the angled side.

564
00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:30.960
It's just like when you open a beer can,
so it doesn't splash.

565
00:25:30.999 --> 00:25:33.062
It splashes no matter what you do.

566
00:25:33.234 --> 00:25:35.163
(Noisy)

567
00:25:35.273 --> 00:25:37.257
Anyone else who goes sitting down?

568
00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:39.905
(Hee-chul, Sang-min, and Lee Teuk)

569
00:25:39.914 --> 00:25:41.780
It's more sanitary.

570
00:25:41.921 --> 00:25:46.663
I go sitting down, and make sure I put
the lid down when I flush.

571
00:25:47.418 --> 00:25:49.179
That, I agree.

572
00:25:49.304 --> 00:25:52.601
I heard all the germs splash out
when you flush.

573
00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:55.734
It's the same as when you pee.
The lid should be down.

574
00:25:55.875 --> 00:25:57.632
Should I pee with the lid closed then?

575
00:25:57.703 --> 00:26:00.015
Yes, with the lid closed... What?

576
00:26:00.307 --> 00:26:03.984
We've been talking for 30 minutes
over how to pee.

577
00:26:04.833 --> 00:26:06.819
Next question!

578
00:26:07.125 --> 00:26:10.562
Come to think of it, since I debuted,

579
00:26:10.609 --> 00:26:12.898
I heard this phrase the most.

580
00:26:13.195 --> 00:26:15.194
What do you think it is?

581
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:17.843
"Eun-hyuk, I'm just gonna go home and
sleep tonight."

582
00:26:19.321 --> 00:26:21.319
(That's not it!)

583
00:26:21.343 --> 00:26:23.046
"I have a curfew!"

584
00:26:24.865 --> 00:26:27.359
He's in our team, why's he being that way?

585
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:29.780
Oh yeah, we need to promote our new album.

586
00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.312
"Oppa..."

587
00:26:31.367 --> 00:26:34.609
It doesn't start with "Oppa,"
it's not that.

588
00:26:35.129 --> 00:26:36.796
"Why are you so skinny?"

589
00:26:36.898 --> 00:26:37.702
No.

590
00:26:37.749 --> 00:26:40.804
"Doesn't it smell like anchovy somewhere?"

591
00:26:42.526 --> 00:26:44.007
"Do you smell something burning?"

592
00:26:44.031 --> 00:26:45.640
"Anchovies burning."

593
00:26:46.007 --> 00:26:47.607
I got it.

594
00:26:47.843 --> 00:26:49.382
"Why are you so ugly?"

595
00:26:49.687 --> 00:26:51.468
(Appalled)

596
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.304
Why are you so ugly?

597
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.859
Ye-sung's good-looking though.

598
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.601
Is it something the fans say?

599
00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.116
Is it about your looks?

600
00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:02.226
(I'm getting it!)

601
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.327
"Eun-hyuk, I think you're great
in every way."

602
00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:08.452
"But why is your mouth so close
to your nose?"

603
00:27:08.769 --> 00:27:10.491
(Won't show it)

604
00:27:11.538 --> 00:27:14.098
"You went through cosmetic surgery
but you still look like that?"

605
00:27:14.319 --> 00:27:15.952
I didn't have surgery!

606
00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.116
"Have you thought about getting
plastic surgery?"

607
00:27:19.398 --> 00:27:20.998
(These people...)

608
00:27:21.124 --> 00:27:24.359
I thought about it, but the management
told me not to.

609
00:27:24.547 --> 00:27:27.460
They said it'll be a huge procedure.

610
00:27:27.757 --> 00:27:30.734
- Is it a good thing? Or a bad thing?
- Yes, give us a hint!

611
00:27:30.851 --> 00:27:32.451
It's not a good thing.

612
00:27:32.492 --> 00:27:36.640
When I hear this, it makes me feel
like I have to work a lot harder.

613
00:27:36.679 --> 00:27:38.694
I got it!

614
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.984
Can I get it right?

615
00:27:40.007 --> 00:27:41.804
I don't think you know it.

616
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:44.538
(What people say to Eun-hyuk)

617
00:27:44.647 --> 00:27:46.515
"Lee Teuk, get ready!"

618
00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:49.687
Correct!

619
00:27:50.394 --> 00:27:55.327
"Lee Teuk! Hello!"
"Lee Teuk, we love seeing you on TV."

620
00:27:55.352 --> 00:27:56.952
(People get confused)

621
00:27:57.015 --> 00:27:58.788
I heard it so much!

622
00:28:01.159 --> 00:28:03.202
But you guys don't look alike.

623
00:28:03.273 --> 00:28:05.194
His body shape is Lee-Teuk-ish.

624
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.179
(Is it?)

625
00:28:08.054 --> 00:28:11.312
I think the sound of "Lee Teuk" just
stands out more.

626
00:28:11.337 --> 00:28:15.274
It's harder to remember "Eun-hyuk"
compared to "Lee Teuk."

627
00:28:15.299 --> 00:28:18.718
It sounds like one full name,
"Lee-Teuk-Eun-Hyuk."

628
00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:22.023
(The two can't be separated)

629
00:28:23.439 --> 00:28:25.554
Yeah, your face isn't so impressionable.

630
00:28:25.747 --> 00:28:27.843
(Speechless)

631
00:28:29.256 --> 00:28:32.709
Eun-hyuk was voted to be the worst-looking
one on "Strong Heart."

632
00:28:32.781 --> 00:28:34.569
So appalling, right?

633
00:28:35.664 --> 00:28:37.171
Why's that appalling?

634
00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.468
How do you think you rank in this room
for looks?

635
00:28:39.523 --> 00:28:41.929
Among us in here?

636
00:28:41.954 --> 00:28:44.109
How many people do you think you can
beat in looks?

637
00:28:44.672 --> 00:28:46.272
Tell us the number.

638
00:28:46.413 --> 00:28:48.851
I think at least 3 under me.

639
00:28:49.031 --> 00:28:51.319
Tell us who the three are!

640
00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:52.959
Who's the first one?

641
00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:57.999
Do you think they're the same three
we have in mind?

642
00:28:58.664 --> 00:29:01.640
We have "the Big Three" of the show here.

643
00:29:01.836 --> 00:29:04.937
(The Absolute Big Three)

644
00:29:05.007 --> 00:29:07.538
And the last two always fight at the end.

645
00:29:07.902 --> 00:29:09.687
(Guilty)

646
00:29:13.317 --> 00:29:15.460
I always won, among the two!

647
00:29:16.078 --> 00:29:18.905
I think Shin Dong, Yeong-cheol,
and Jang-hoon.

648
00:29:19.142 --> 00:29:20.742
(Me?)

649
00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:24.554
Two from this show, and one from
Super Junior.

650
00:29:25.272 --> 00:29:27.187
Yeong-cheol and Jang-hoon!

651
00:29:27.374 --> 00:29:29.491
It might not be me this time!

652
00:29:30.022 --> 00:29:32.022
Maybe not me this time either.

653
00:29:33.341 --> 00:29:34.718
(How dare you say that!)

654
00:29:34.743 --> 00:29:36.257
Tell us who!

655
00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:41.429
(Decisively Yeong-cheol)

656
00:29:41.578 --> 00:29:44.171
Why am I always last in these things?

657
00:29:45.828 --> 00:29:48.155
Who's the one from Super Junior?

658
00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:50.984
Shin Dong? Lee Teuk?

659
00:29:52.613 --> 00:29:55.015
Ye-sung always covers half of his face.

660
00:29:56.723 --> 00:29:59.523
(Tries to smile)

661
00:29:59.879 --> 00:30:02.405
Show us your forehead if you're confident.

662
00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:06.116
(Is it really Lee Teuk?"

663
00:30:06.141 --> 00:30:08.007
(Heart thumping)

664
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.420
It's Ye-sung!

665
00:30:11.445 --> 00:30:12.921
(Do not agree)

666
00:30:14.048 --> 00:30:15.890
So Ye-sung and I are about the same?

667
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:18.148
No, you're not.

668
00:30:18.515 --> 00:30:21.593
Draw the person, and we'll guess.

669
00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:25.327
It's Jang-hoon.

670
00:30:25.542 --> 00:30:27.609
That's enough, we got it!

671
00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:30.679
Draw more!

672
00:30:36.336 --> 00:30:38.140
(We got it!)

673
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.382
(It's gotta be Ho-dong)

674
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:48.374
(Jang-hoon wins again today,
the battle of the Big Three)

675
00:30:49.406 --> 00:30:52.218
I've never seen anyone taller than
the crane.

676
00:30:52.281 --> 00:30:54.226
You lose to me every time!

677
00:30:55.088 --> 00:30:57.476
Even I can tell who that is.

678
00:30:58.593 --> 00:31:01.319
We can imagine your eyes, nose, and mouth
on that face.

679
00:31:01.344 --> 00:31:03.687
(Right here!)

680
00:31:04.687 --> 00:31:06.374
You make a good pair.

681
00:31:08.706 --> 00:31:10.295
(The worst-looking pair, determined
by Eun-hyuk)

682
00:31:10.328 --> 00:31:12.749
The ugly ones are sitting together!

683
00:31:13.718 --> 00:31:15.663
(Hee-chul is up next!)

684
00:31:16.354 --> 00:31:17.671
We have to take his quiz too?

685
00:31:17.703 --> 00:31:19.109
I know, right?

686
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.187
I feel so awkward walking up there.

687
00:31:21.903 --> 00:31:23.882
It's a rare scene to see!

688
00:31:24.577 --> 00:31:26.562
(Hee-chul's Guess Who I Am Quiz)

689
00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:28.421
Is there something we don't know
about him?

690
00:31:28.531 --> 00:31:30.131
(The first question)

691
00:31:30.343 --> 00:31:33.280
I'm famous for being fearless.

692
00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.053
I don't get scared easily.

693
00:31:35.608 --> 00:31:43.163
But though I'm so daring, there's a time
I have a hard time and get insecure.

694
00:31:43.828 --> 00:31:45.069
When do you think that is?

695
00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:49.054
When Ho-dong stares you down
when you say something?

696
00:31:49.562 --> 00:31:51.382
(Not at all!)

697
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.069
I just spit out ink like an octopus
if he does that.

698
00:31:55.941 --> 00:31:57.671
Ow, my eyes!

699
00:31:58.687 --> 00:32:00.898
(I got hit again today)

700
00:32:02.677 --> 00:32:04.968
(Lee Teuk still isn't used to this vibe)

701
00:32:06.615 --> 00:32:08.948
I think this is the correct answer.

702
00:32:09.773 --> 00:32:13.054
A group-group came on the show
as guests.

703
00:32:13.218 --> 00:32:15.015
But in that one group...

704
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.640
There were 2 members you dated before.

705
00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:22.437
(Bingo!)

706
00:32:23.215 --> 00:32:26.202
(We'll just make this the correct answer)

707
00:32:27.703 --> 00:32:30.366
(The biggest crisis of Hee-chul)

708
00:32:30.422 --> 00:32:32.288
That's not it?

709
00:32:34.115 --> 00:32:35.905
Why are your ears so red?

710
00:32:36.017 --> 00:32:38.249
(Burning up)

711
00:32:39.653 --> 00:32:42.320
(A time of celebration for the brothers)

712
00:32:42.742 --> 00:32:45.288
We'll just call it the correct answer
and finish here.

713
00:32:45.327 --> 00:32:47.179
(No more questions)

714
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:51.389
(Revenge!)

715
00:32:51.452 --> 00:32:53.119
I think it might be this.

716
00:32:53.265 --> 00:32:54.905
A group-group came on the show,

717
00:32:54.937 --> 00:32:59.202
and one of them was someone you asked out
but got rejected.

718
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:00.976
I've never been rejected.

719
00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:03.077
(Upsetting)

720
00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:04.898
Oh, a boy-group came on...

721
00:33:08.881 --> 00:33:11.069
Go on, "A boy-group came on the show..."

722
00:33:11.838 --> 00:33:13.226
(Didn't hear him)

723
00:33:13.515 --> 00:33:18.601
So it wasn't a girl-group, but a boy-group
had 2 members you dated before.

724
00:33:18.626 --> 00:33:20.718
(I'm ruined!)

725
00:33:20.773 --> 00:33:22.991
He must be the one that started
the rumor!

726
00:33:23.061 --> 00:33:24.296
How can you do that?

727
00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:26.788
You're the one who started the rumor?

728
00:33:26.843 --> 00:33:28.523
It was a love-triangle!

729
00:33:29.156 --> 00:33:30.812
(Not boy-group)

730
00:33:31.829 --> 00:33:33.601
(Got the attention he wanted)

731
00:33:34.961 --> 00:33:37.726
Is it today? When members of your own
team come on the show.

732
00:33:37.757 --> 00:33:39.187
No, it's not like that.

733
00:33:40.617 --> 00:33:42.663
What you always thought as a rumor...

734
00:33:42.741 --> 00:33:47.702
The rumor that Ho-dong beats people
up after shooting...

735
00:33:48.562 --> 00:33:50.327
You saw it in real life.

736
00:33:51.241 --> 00:33:54.171
That did get me scared the first time
I saw it happen.

737
00:33:54.236 --> 00:33:55.836
(Not so pleased)

738
00:33:56.328 --> 00:33:59.109
If you're gonna say that, it needs to be
really funny.

739
00:33:59.375 --> 00:34:01.335
(I apologize)

740
00:34:02.211 --> 00:34:04.093
It needs to get bigger laugh than that.

741
00:34:04.968 --> 00:34:10.890
Remember when Kang Kyun-sung had
long hair, then cut it short?

742
00:34:10.961 --> 00:34:13.827
It's because Ho-dong grabbed and pulled
his hair, and he lost a lot of hair.

743
00:34:13.867 --> 00:34:15.467
That's why he cut it.

744
00:34:15.687 --> 00:34:18.218
Yeah, I grabbed and pulled his hair.

745
00:34:18.855 --> 00:34:20.359
I just plucked them out.

746
00:34:22.432 --> 00:34:24.265
Ye-sung's getting scared.

747
00:34:24.459 --> 00:34:26.835
Just what role are you playing here,
Ye-sung?

748
00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.999
(Not so comfortable)

749
00:34:32.093 --> 00:34:36.015
I think he's playing the role of
being a victim today, like a hostage.

750
00:34:36.156 --> 00:34:39.007
(All he did was to go on Star King before)

751
00:34:39.397 --> 00:34:41.296
(I'm happy!)

752
00:34:43.836 --> 00:34:49.765
It's not during shooting that I feel
scared or insecure.

753
00:34:50.172 --> 00:34:52.710
(Not during shooting the show?)

754
00:34:53.706 --> 00:34:55.827
Must be in the waiting room!

755
00:34:55.961 --> 00:34:57.827
That's a good direction to take.

756
00:34:57.852 --> 00:34:59.054
The waiting room!

757
00:34:59.101 --> 00:35:03.413
Got it! When Yeong-cheol tries to
talk to you in the morning.

758
00:35:04.405 --> 00:35:05.624
Why can't I talk to him?

759
00:35:05.656 --> 00:35:08.929
When he just talks about himself
when no one asked him!

760
00:35:09.122 --> 00:35:12.179
He doesn't respond when I talk to him
anyways.

761
00:35:12.699 --> 00:35:15.296
So he comes to my waiting room.

762
00:35:15.816 --> 00:35:18.913
Yeah, I go over to Kyung-hoon's waiting
room instead.

763
00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:21.976
Got it! Ho-dong...

764
00:35:22.945 --> 00:35:26.288
"Hee-chul, what do you want to eat?
A bowl of cold noodles?"

765
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:29.968
When Ho-dong asks you to eat with him,
when you don't want to.

766
00:35:30.007 --> 00:35:31.929
That might actually be better.

767
00:35:31.961 --> 00:35:35.780
He keeps ordering food right before
you guys are about to shoot.

768
00:35:37.113 --> 00:35:39.218
It's a bit similar but...

769
00:35:40.852 --> 00:35:44.929
Because you keep pestering
your stylists in the waiting room...

770
00:35:45.203 --> 00:35:48.132
I secretly filmed you being mean to them.

771
00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.874
And you're scared that I might release it.

772
00:35:50.929 --> 00:35:55.484
I was expecting him to say something
like that, I actually secretly filmed him.

773
00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:57.257
I'll put it on my social media.

774
00:35:57.289 --> 00:35:59.921
I clearly apologized.

775
00:36:01.837 --> 00:36:03.984
(I shouldn't have tried)

776
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.093
I won't discuss this any further.

777
00:36:06.156 --> 00:36:07.609
I know!

778
00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:12.632
I know this because I used to share
a waiting room with Ho-dong for years.

779
00:36:12.679 --> 00:36:15.479
He keeps telling me to turn off the light.

780
00:36:16.116 --> 00:36:19.241
He says he can't sleep if people
keep walking in and out.

781
00:36:19.312 --> 00:36:20.912
It's really similar!

782
00:36:21.571 --> 00:36:24.796
So I have to lie down too, though
I don't want to sleep.

783
00:36:24.836 --> 00:36:26.194
We lied down together?

784
00:36:26.234 --> 00:36:27.788
No, no.

785
00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:32.148
Then staff comes in, but they're too scared
to open the door.

786
00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:35.890
They knock and look, and I tell them,
"Come in, quietly."

787
00:36:35.953 --> 00:36:37.991
"We have to start shooting..."

788
00:36:38.179 --> 00:36:40.484
"Let me sleep a little more!"

789
00:36:41.507 --> 00:36:44.671
If you're gonna say that, it needs to
be funny.

790
00:36:44.703 --> 00:36:47.194
But Teuk can't lie and it's really similar.

791
00:36:47.203 --> 00:36:48.803
I got it!

792
00:36:48.882 --> 00:36:51.140
You have to go into shoot soon.

793
00:36:51.179 --> 00:36:52.484
- Right?
- Yeah.

794
00:36:52.531 --> 00:36:56.319
But you have to go somewhere after
this shoot.

795
00:36:56.812 --> 00:36:58.436
Wrong, close your mouth.

796
00:36:58.996 --> 00:37:00.596
(Yup)

797
00:37:02.882 --> 00:37:04.405
It's his first time talking!

798
00:37:06.218 --> 00:37:09.834
The staff needs to tell Ho-dong that
they have to start shooting.

799
00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:12.882
But they ask you to tell him instead.

800
00:37:13.797 --> 00:37:18.054
Really similar, mix it with what
Teuk said.

801
00:37:18.226 --> 00:37:19.132
Got it!

802
00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:22.710
You have to go into shoot, and you have
to wake up Ho-dong!

803
00:37:22.812 --> 00:37:24.412
Correct!

804
00:37:27.646 --> 00:37:29.382
(Appalled)

805
00:37:30.586 --> 00:37:32.819
(Is Hee-chul making up stuff?)

806
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:37.218
It's only our room that someone
can sleep in.

807
00:37:38.213 --> 00:37:39.632
I'm so baffled by this charge.

808
00:37:39.804 --> 00:37:41.413
There's a couch in the waiting room.

809
00:37:41.437 --> 00:37:42.991
And he'd sleep like this.

810
00:37:43.023 --> 00:37:45.374
You're the witness for this.

811
00:37:46.039 --> 00:37:48.530
Have you ever seen me sleep, ever?

812
00:37:49.195 --> 00:37:50.476
I don't sleep!

813
00:37:50.515 --> 00:37:52.449
(What are you talking about?)

814
00:37:52.791 --> 00:37:54.109
(OK, fine)

815
00:37:54.335 --> 00:37:56.602
(Gave his testimony with his eyes)

816
00:37:56.687 --> 00:37:58.749
He'd sleep like this on the couch.

817
00:37:58.804 --> 00:38:03.827
So when it's time to go into shoot,
the staff would come and tell us.

818
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:07.226
But if they feel like Ho-dong heard them
but he's still not getting up,

819
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.015
they get too scared to tell him again.

820
00:38:09.054 --> 00:38:13.046
Then they come and ask me to wake him up.

821
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:17.429
So I go and say, "Ho-dong, we have to
start shooting."

822
00:38:17.476 --> 00:38:18.999
"We'll start in 5 minutes."

823
00:38:19.023 --> 00:38:21.187
"OK, got it."

824
00:38:21.242 --> 00:38:25.663
Then the last resort for the staff
if they have to start shooting is...

825
00:38:25.687 --> 00:38:28.085
Right? They start yelling at
me and Yeong-cheol.

826
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:30.874
"We gotta start shooting, what are you
doing, Yeong-cheol?"

827
00:38:30.906 --> 00:38:33.218
"Hee-chul, I told you to hurry!"

828
00:38:33.265 --> 00:38:36.163
All I remember is that someone's always
yelling at me.

829
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.140
We didn't do anything wrong!

830
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.694
(Mistake to share a waiting room
with Ho-dong)

831
00:38:42.726 --> 00:38:45.226
Yeong-cheol's done getting dressed,
he's got his microphone on already.

832
00:38:45.257 --> 00:38:46.780
"Why aren't you still ready?"

833
00:38:46.827 --> 00:38:48.851
"I did, I'm going now!"

834
00:38:49.567 --> 00:38:51.710
- "Why aren't you dressed?"
- "I am."

835
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.820
You're so good at being funny on TV!

836
00:38:56.052 --> 00:38:58.507
(All his frustration comes out)

837
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.163
Was he always this good?

838
00:39:02.297 --> 00:39:05.296
Why does it feel like Ye-sung
keeps getting shorter?

839
00:39:06.285 --> 00:39:09.140
I was afraid Ho-dong's face won't
be shown in camera.

840
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.609
(Having fun watching him)

841
00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.859
(Stiff)

842
00:39:15.414 --> 00:39:17.452
You're slouching like that for me?

843
00:39:17.484 --> 00:39:19.257
To make sure the camera gets my face?

844
00:39:19.447 --> 00:39:21.507
(How Ye-sung changed his position)

845
00:39:22.208 --> 00:39:24.866
Thanks, you're bringing tears to my eyes.

846
00:39:25.187 --> 00:39:28.520
(The guest is making sure MC is getting
exposure)

847
00:39:28.562 --> 00:39:31.140
Can't you just take Ho-dong out then?

848
00:39:31.195 --> 00:39:33.390
The important ones are Jang-hoon and
Sang-min anyways.

849
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.843
You can't shoot if Ho-dong's not here?

850
00:39:38.164 --> 00:39:41.202
He won't come on TV for another
6 years, it's OK.

851
00:39:41.818 --> 00:39:43.788
I'm done after today!

852
00:39:46.259 --> 00:39:48.194
Ye-sung, that was clever.

853
00:39:48.289 --> 00:39:50.288
Was it OK?

854
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:51.819
That was good.

855
00:39:52.867 --> 00:39:54.929
On to the next question.

856
00:39:56.311 --> 00:40:01.976
I have trouble dating for a long time,
unlike how I seem.

857
00:40:02.062 --> 00:40:03.116
That's true.

858
00:40:03.141 --> 00:40:04.741
"Unlike how you seem"?

859
00:40:04.765 --> 00:40:08.327
- I always get dumped.
- You make it that way.

860
00:40:08.751 --> 00:40:10.827
(A straight-forward response from a member)

861
00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:13.210
(Must persevere)

862
00:40:13.828 --> 00:40:15.007
He's very clever.

863
00:40:15.031 --> 00:40:16.890
He knows what he's doing, right?

864
00:40:16.929 --> 00:40:19.265
He just makes the girl not
like him anymore.

865
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:22.273
He makes the girl break up with him
so he can feel better about himself.

866
00:40:22.281 --> 00:40:24.429
OK, my questions end here.

867
00:40:27.984 --> 00:40:33.444
I make it clear when I like someone,
and my confessions of love never failed.

868
00:40:33.656 --> 00:40:39.054
How do you think I confess my love to
someone, to succeed 100%?

869
00:40:39.414 --> 00:40:40.702
Got it.

870
00:40:40.726 --> 00:40:43.694
You don't clearly ask her to start
dating you.

871
00:40:43.734 --> 00:40:46.819
You make it confusing for the girl to
see if you're dating or not.

872
00:40:46.859 --> 00:40:50.280
- You just keep going on dates.
- Makes the girl confused.

873
00:40:51.124 --> 00:40:52.499
Is that right?

874
00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:56.234
You make the girl ask, "Are we
dating each other or not?"

875
00:40:56.312 --> 00:41:00.374
You never bring it up until the girl first
asks, "What are we doing?"

876
00:41:00.429 --> 00:41:02.210
That's just a very bad person.

877
00:41:02.281 --> 00:41:03.788
You think I'm a bad person?

878
00:41:03.836 --> 00:41:05.101
100%? I got it.

879
00:41:05.126 --> 00:41:07.163
(Lee Teuk and Eun-hyuk at the same time)

880
00:41:07.195 --> 00:41:09.804
Oh, I thought both of you are Lee Teuk.

881
00:41:09.828 --> 00:41:11.428
OK, the little Lee Teuk.

882
00:41:11.812 --> 00:41:13.077
With the guy...

883
00:41:13.117 --> 00:41:14.460
With the guy?

884
00:41:16.432 --> 00:41:18.874
(Punished more severely
for teasing him earlier)

885
00:41:20.922 --> 00:41:21.788
Got it.

886
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.202
You're known to be the man of stamina
on this show.

887
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.460
You show the girl your stamina.

888
00:41:27.538 --> 00:41:29.788
(How do you do that?)

889
00:41:30.546 --> 00:41:33.335
Like doing pull-ups all of a sudden.

890
00:41:33.406 --> 00:41:35.812
You start to exercise in front of her.

891
00:41:35.906 --> 00:41:38.960
You make a lot of TV appearances.

892
00:41:39.031 --> 00:41:43.882
So you'd tell the girl, "I'm gonna be on TV
today, make sure you watch it."

893
00:41:43.976 --> 00:41:47.843
Then you confess your love for her
on TV through a certain sign.

894
00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:51.210
The girl sees on TV that you're confessing
your love for her.

895
00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:53.265
Isn't that what you do?

896
00:41:53.898 --> 00:41:56.507
I noticed that you kept doing weird
things on TV.

897
00:41:57.172 --> 00:41:58.515
He keeps standing like this.

898
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.200
(Taken aback)

899
00:42:01.468 --> 00:42:03.952
(He wants to reach his love
beyond the screen)

900
00:42:05.364 --> 00:42:08.491
You like someone who's a ski jumper?

901
00:42:12.014 --> 00:42:14.148
(Never thought the story would go this way)

902
00:42:14.507 --> 00:42:18.234
I know Hee-chul very well, and he's
good at touching someone.

903
00:42:18.981 --> 00:42:20.843
(Me?)

904
00:42:21.093 --> 00:42:23.515
He told me these things many times.

905
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.437
So he kisses the girl first.

906
00:42:26.802 --> 00:42:28.546
"Will you date me now?"

907
00:42:29.023 --> 00:42:32.905
No, he first kisses her says, "That was to
 tell you that I have feelings for you."

908
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.476
Then he kisses her again and says,
"That was my propose."

909
00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:37.186
That's it!

910
00:42:37.398 --> 00:42:38.679
Wrong!

911
00:42:38.711 --> 00:42:40.351
Please think about my public image.

912
00:42:40.375 --> 00:42:42.484
Your public image?

913
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:46.819
You'd tell the girl to wait for you
for a moment,

914
00:42:46.843 --> 00:42:50.069
then you go to a convenience store
and  buy her a pack of cigarettes

915
00:42:50.086 --> 00:42:51.484
to confess your love.

916
00:42:53.028 --> 00:42:55.265
"Wanna make donuts together?"

917
00:42:56.065 --> 00:42:58.780
"If you smoke this, it means
we're dating now."

918
00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:01.218
Feels similar, but not it.

919
00:43:01.234 --> 00:43:03.132
This phrase works every time.

920
00:43:03.172 --> 00:43:05.359
- It's a phrase?
- Yes, a phrase.

921
00:43:05.406 --> 00:43:11.023
You might find something like this in
a romantic comic book.

922
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.257
Something weird like, "I want your lips."

923
00:43:14.484 --> 00:43:16.084
(What was that?)

924
00:43:16.147 --> 00:43:17.804
They say that in manga books.

925
00:43:17.836 --> 00:43:20.023
It should be something strong.

926
00:43:20.242 --> 00:43:22.890
"I'm gonna date you whether you like it
or not."

927
00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:24.952
(Wrong, but close)

928
00:43:24.992 --> 00:43:27.187
Or, "This is what I want!"

929
00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:30.843
You're just talking like a manga character.

930
00:43:31.983 --> 00:43:33.515
Was that Doraemon?

931
00:43:34.461 --> 00:43:35.984
Got it!

932
00:43:36.007 --> 00:43:38.437
I'll think that we're dating
starting today.

933
00:43:38.484 --> 00:43:43.226
If you don't like it, then don't pick up
my calls anymore, it's your choice.

934
00:43:43.257 --> 00:43:45.312
It's very similar!

935
00:43:45.445 --> 00:43:47.382
(Similar?)

936
00:43:47.922 --> 00:43:49.827
I'm gonna start dating you now.

937
00:43:49.851 --> 00:43:53.937
Since it's our first day dating,
I'm gonna kiss you now.

938
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.663
(He keeps doing that!)

939
00:43:57.711 --> 00:44:00.944
"If you want to date me too, kiss me back."

940
00:44:01.062 --> 00:44:03.944
"If you don't want to, just
close your mouth."

941
00:44:06.733 --> 00:44:08.327
Close your mouth for a second.

942
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.562
(Tried too hard for a second)

943
00:44:11.132 --> 00:44:13.538
I know you're trying, but calm down
a little bit.

944
00:44:13.624 --> 00:44:15.773
This seat makes me feel that way.

945
00:44:16.023 --> 00:44:17.623
Got it!

946
00:44:18.031 --> 00:44:20.202
"It's our first day as a couple today."

947
00:44:20.273 --> 00:44:24.226
"Since we're dating, call me "Unnie" from
now on, like 'big sister.'"

948
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.523
(Hee-chul Unnie!)

949
00:44:27.461 --> 00:44:29.859
(Changing gender as soon as he
starts to date)

950
00:44:31.242 --> 00:44:33.585
"You're the 'oppa' from now on,
and I'm the 'unnie.'"

951
00:44:34.159 --> 00:44:35.718
You're crazy!

952
00:44:36.906 --> 00:44:38.765
"I'm your sister!"

953
00:44:40.578 --> 00:44:42.765
So you're with the girl.

954
00:44:43.797 --> 00:44:47.124
"I'm gonna hold your hand. Let go
of it if you don't like it."

955
00:44:47.156 --> 00:44:49.062
It's so similar!

956
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:50.234
It's not the hand.

957
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:53.687
"I'll hold your foot, take your foot
out if you don't like it!"

958
00:44:55.773 --> 00:44:58.694
Wait, Ho-dong just stared down Ye-sung.

959
00:44:58.734 --> 00:45:00.007
Say what you want.

960
00:45:00.023 --> 00:45:01.851
That was funny.

961
00:45:01.953 --> 00:45:03.874
- Got it!
- Yes, Jang-hoon.

962
00:45:04.054 --> 00:45:07.085
"I'm gonna kiss you now, you can dodge
if you don't want to."

963
00:45:07.172 --> 00:45:08.772
Oh that's terrible!

964
00:45:09.492 --> 00:45:11.562
That's correct!

965
00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:14.905
He's so weird!

966
00:45:14.976 --> 00:45:16.874
(Dodge if you don't want to)

967
00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:18.538
How can you say that?

968
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:22.780
"Let's date each other. I'll keep
my eyes closed, kiss me if you want to."

969
00:45:22.812 --> 00:45:24.499
Oh, your eyes will be closed.

970
00:45:24.547 --> 00:45:26.359
"If you don't like me, you can
just leave."

971
00:45:27.172 --> 00:45:28.554
And they all kissed you?

972
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:29.749
Yeah.

973
00:45:29.773 --> 00:45:33.374
It's because that's you, if it were someone
else, they'll spit on his face!

974
00:45:33.531 --> 00:45:38.546
He's really manly, he'll tell us that he's
going to ask someone out that day.

975
00:45:38.586 --> 00:45:41.491
He'd say, "I'll call you if it works out."

976
00:45:41.609 --> 00:45:43.209
He just goes for it.

977
00:45:43.414 --> 00:45:45.828
I'll call her and she'll pick up,
"What's up?"

978
00:45:45.836 --> 00:45:49.702
"I'm on my way to confess my love for you,
come out."

979
00:45:50.554 --> 00:45:56.265
It's not that he's scared of rejection, but
he's confident not to get rejected.

980
00:45:56.343 --> 00:45:58.304
He's so confident that he does
whatever he wants.

981
00:45:58.343 --> 00:46:01.773
If I said, "Wait for me, I'm on my way
to ask you out,"

982
00:46:01.797 --> 00:46:03.460
"You're nuts!"

983
00:46:04.715 --> 00:46:07.429
(We can see how this will play out)

984
00:46:08.207 --> 00:46:09.968
That was my last question.

985
00:46:09.992 --> 00:46:12.187
(Lee Teuk's "Guess Who I Am" quiz)

986
00:46:12.233 --> 00:46:14.851
A lot of people call Lee Teuk "Eun-hyuk,"
too.

987
00:46:14.876 --> 00:46:16.624
They call you "Eun-hyuk"?

988
00:46:16.929 --> 00:46:18.257
No.

989
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:22.679
We went to Fashion Week together
recently.

990
00:46:22.734 --> 00:46:27.780
Someone put, "He's looking charming today,
Eun-hyuk" when Teuk came on.

991
00:46:28.089 --> 00:46:30.257
(I don't hear anything)

992
00:46:31.367 --> 00:46:32.967
OK, here's my quiz.

993
00:46:33.039 --> 00:46:33.890
So mean!

994
00:46:33.953 --> 00:46:38.757
Something happened recently that I felt
that I'm getting older.

995
00:46:38.835 --> 00:46:42.710
Guess what happened to make me
feel that way.

996
00:46:43.105 --> 00:46:46.999
When you found yourself scratching
your toes at home without realizing it.

997
00:46:47.047 --> 00:46:48.991
Then you smelled your fingers!

998
00:46:49.703 --> 00:46:51.921
Unintentionally,

999
00:46:51.968 --> 00:46:55.437
you found yourself humming an old trot
song you heard somewhere repeatedly.

1000
00:46:55.531 --> 00:46:56.085
No.

1001
00:46:56.125 --> 00:46:57.710
You like trot songs now.

1002
00:46:57.757 --> 00:47:02.468
You start to refer to yourself as
ahjuhsee [old man]" instead of "oppa."

1003
00:47:02.523 --> 00:47:04.148
No, it's not like that.

1004
00:47:04.241 --> 00:47:08.241
I feel that way from time to time,
it makes me sad.

1005
00:47:08.414 --> 00:47:14.952
After I eat a meal, I was able to get up
easily from my chair before.

1006
00:47:15.039 --> 00:47:17.241
But I make sounds these days.

1007
00:47:17.398 --> 00:47:19.827
"Ow, ow..."

1008
00:47:21.689 --> 00:47:24.484
(Older men make weird noises
wherever they are)

1009
00:47:24.632 --> 00:47:28.062
You start talking and singing to yourself
for no reason.

1010
00:47:30.353 --> 00:47:32.632
(The correct answer already?)

1011
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:35.343
You talk to yourself and sing to yourself?

1012
00:47:35.367 --> 00:47:37.530
Eun-hyuk is right!

1013
00:47:38.628 --> 00:47:41.507
It's when I talk with melody.

1014
00:47:42.406 --> 00:47:44.538
Men who are at my dad's age do that.

1015
00:47:44.578 --> 00:47:48.429
I live alone with my dog, and after
a certain point,

1016
00:47:48.492 --> 00:47:50.921
I'll say things to myself with melody.

1017
00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:56.296
"I open the door, feed my dog,
and take a shower."

1018
00:47:56.687 --> 00:47:59.093
(No way!)

1019
00:47:59.336 --> 00:48:01.469
(Feels like he's making this up)

1020
00:48:01.637 --> 00:48:04.187
(I'm being honest!)

1021
00:48:05.358 --> 00:48:06.958
That's enough!

1022
00:48:07.297 --> 00:48:09.726
(Everyone's criticizing that he's
making this up)

1023
00:48:09.797 --> 00:48:12.851
To make an honest confession...

1024
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.249
I do that sometimes too.

1025
00:48:14.288 --> 00:48:17.405
Me too, I hum to myself when I'm
in the shower.

1026
00:48:17.781 --> 00:48:20.257
"The water is hot!"

1027
00:48:21.039 --> 00:48:24.030
- But it's always the same melody!
- Yeah, same all the time.

1028
00:48:25.456 --> 00:48:28.132
"I'll get a drink of water."

1029
00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:29.132
My dad would go,

1030
00:48:29.164 --> 00:48:32.140
"I'm done eating now so..."

1031
00:48:32.187 --> 00:48:35.601
"I need to give medicine for my crop
in the field..."

1032
00:48:35.672 --> 00:48:38.148
"Soo-geun, if you're not going to school,
can you..."

1033
00:48:38.179 --> 00:48:39.585
"Help your dad?"

1034
00:48:39.815 --> 00:48:42.123
(That can't be true)

1035
00:48:42.244 --> 00:48:44.640
(Everyone feels that he made it up)

1036
00:48:44.879 --> 00:48:46.694
(Embarrassed)

1037
00:48:46.952 --> 00:48:49.460
Why would he go into R&B all of a sudden?

1038
00:48:49.515 --> 00:48:52.077
It seems unreal, but it really happens.

1039
00:48:52.086 --> 00:48:54.366
Like a trot song or choir music.

1040
00:48:54.445 --> 00:48:56.249
I'd MC when I'm alone too.

1041
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:58.554
When I get home after work...

1042
00:48:58.843 --> 00:49:01.288
You won't believe this, but I keep going...

1043
00:49:01.343 --> 00:49:03.812
"I'm gonna go and open the door now."

1044
00:49:06.126 --> 00:49:08.405
(Frustrated)

1045
00:49:09.148 --> 00:49:11.280
I think he might do that
in real life.

1046
00:49:11.711 --> 00:49:14.601
Ho-dong! You gave birth to
a monster!

1047
00:49:14.921 --> 00:49:16.359
You raised him to be like that!

1048
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.968
It's so frustrating that you don't
believe me.

1049
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.304
I'm constantly talking to myself alone
at home.

1050
00:49:22.531 --> 00:49:24.131
(Hope it's good)

1051
00:49:24.265 --> 00:49:25.929
"I'm gonna take off my shoes."

1052
00:49:25.961 --> 00:49:28.796
"Then I put my bag down."

1053
00:49:28.932 --> 00:49:30.491
"Now, it's time for food!"

1054
00:49:30.869 --> 00:49:33.124
(I guess we'll never know the truth)

1055
00:49:33.164 --> 00:49:39.843
So I prepared a quiz, mixing how I like to
MC all the time and this old-man feel.

1056
00:49:40.007 --> 00:49:41.607
It goes like this.

1057
00:49:41.625 --> 00:49:43.202
(Practice question)

1058
00:49:43.789 --> 00:49:45.389
Korea!

1059
00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.944
Correct!

1060
00:49:47.007 --> 00:49:48.663
It'll go like this?

1061
00:49:48.867 --> 00:49:52.343
- OK, give us the real question.
- Something hard for the first one.

1062
00:49:59.623 --> 00:50:00.718
Correct!

1063
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.288
It's the same as the other song!

1064
00:50:04.224 --> 00:50:05.835
It's slightly different.

1065
00:50:11.497 --> 00:50:13.819
(How's that any different?)

1066
00:50:13.998 --> 00:50:15.499
I think just your facial expression
was different.

1067
00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:17.679
No, the rhythm's different.

1068
00:50:18.406 --> 00:50:20.006
Next question.

1069
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:23.898
Got it! "Sorry Sorry!"

1070
00:50:23.937 --> 00:50:25.366
Correct!

1071
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.030
(Objection!)

1072
00:50:28.343 --> 00:50:30.749
(It sounds like another song!)

1073
00:50:31.139 --> 00:50:32.398
It's different.

1074
00:50:42.355 --> 00:50:44.827
(Still confusing)

1075
00:50:45.023 --> 00:50:47.356
The MC has to be good for this one.

1076
00:50:47.656 --> 00:50:50.359
It's funny that he's giving examples.

1077
00:50:50.703 --> 00:50:52.210
Next question!

1078
00:50:52.281 --> 00:50:54.405
Write the answer first.

1079
00:50:57.687 --> 00:51:00.421
We really can't trust each other that much?

1080
00:51:00.446 --> 00:51:02.913
We're so mean to each other, we're
just trying to have some fun.

1081
00:51:02.953 --> 00:51:06.819
But the game's not specific enough.

1082
00:51:06.929 --> 00:51:08.796
OK, I wrote the answer down.

1083
00:51:12.468 --> 00:51:13.890
Got it!

1084
00:51:15.864 --> 00:51:17.694
You're right!

1085
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:21.101
This was "the old man's beat game."

1086
00:51:21.543 --> 00:51:23.991
(Thank you, I'm your MC, Lee Teuk!)

1087
00:51:25.468 --> 00:51:27.905
(Ye-sung's quiz)

1088
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:31.055
For the first time on TV for me...

1089
00:51:31.163 --> 00:51:34.155
Sorry, but can you actually make
eye contact with us?

1090
00:51:35.531 --> 00:51:37.702
Where are you looking?

1091
00:51:37.797 --> 00:51:39.397
Who are you looking at?

1092
00:51:39.578 --> 00:51:43.054
I'll give you that question you've
all been waiting for.

1093
00:51:43.944 --> 00:51:49.116
Because of Ho-dong, I can't go to
Geum-ho-dong or Cheon-ho-dong.

1094
00:51:49.163 --> 00:51:55.530
I'm sure you all know that I get really
nervous on talk shows now.

1095
00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:01.749
What is it that Ho-dong said to me
for me to become this way?

1096
00:52:01.812 --> 00:52:03.413
Getting this nervous on TV shows?

1097
00:52:03.453 --> 00:52:06.476
Pandora's box is finally opening up!

1098
00:52:07.115 --> 00:52:09.480
(What happened between the two of them?)

1099
00:52:09.942 --> 00:52:10.942
Answer!

1100
00:52:11.746 --> 00:52:14.440
"I've never seen anyone
do worse than you!".

1101
00:52:14.465 --> 00:52:17.472
- That's bad.
- I would never be able to do a show then.

1102
00:52:18.152 --> 00:52:20.543
Yeong-cheol is talking from experience.

1103
00:52:20.629 --> 00:52:23.879
I got it. "I'd better not
see you around anymore".

1104
00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:27.019
- That's bad.
- It's similar.

1105
00:52:27.262 --> 00:52:28.754
It's similar to this?

1106
00:52:28.988 --> 00:52:31.625
Then, I wouldn't have come on this show.

1107
00:52:31.684 --> 00:52:35.000
To give you a hint, this
happened a while back.

1108
00:52:35.025 --> 00:52:37.300
- We were recording "Star King".
- They were recording.

1109
00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:42.183
We were in the studio and at that time,
there was over 20 quests on the panel.

1110
00:52:42.442 --> 00:52:45.691
It was when we all sat in rows oft
three, fans in the audience and...

1111
00:52:45.777 --> 00:52:48.175
all of the staff members were there.

1112
00:52:48.402 --> 00:52:49.785
That's where you were traumatized.

1113
00:52:49.879 --> 00:52:50.879
I got it!

1114
00:52:53.504 --> 00:52:56.535
- I'll pretend to be Ho-dong.
- Do what you want.

1115
00:52:57.098 --> 00:52:59.082
Let's say, you did something.

1116
00:52:59.723 --> 00:53:01.222
"What the hell are you doing?".

1117
00:53:01.317 --> 00:53:03.226
"What the hell are you doing?".

1118
00:53:04.332 --> 00:53:06.921
- "What the hell are you doing?".
- Nope.

1119
00:53:07.199 --> 00:53:09.156
I'm glad I'm wrong about my answer.

1120
00:53:09.348 --> 00:53:11.346
I was afraid that might be the answer.

1121
00:53:11.371 --> 00:53:13.574
I would've been shocked
if that was the answer.

1122
00:53:13.692 --> 00:53:16.418
If that was the case, I
would've peed in my pants.

1123
00:53:16.606 --> 00:53:18.144
You didn't pee in your pants?

1124
00:53:18.168 --> 00:53:22.621
I got it. You ambitiously shouted
a line on "Star King" but...

1125
00:53:22.856 --> 00:53:25.246
Ho-dong said, "You're a star?".

1126
00:53:26.543 --> 00:53:27.543
Well, that...

1127
00:53:27.723 --> 00:53:29.761
wasn't me, but Ryeowook.

1128
00:53:30.418 --> 00:53:32.894
- You said that to Ryeowook?
- I got it!

1129
00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:36.019
Wow, you're telling us he
said that to Ryeowook?

1130
00:53:36.973 --> 00:53:39.300
- "You're a star?"
- "You're a star?"

1131
00:53:39.325 --> 00:53:42.136
Ho-dong thought you were a regular person.

1132
00:53:42.231 --> 00:53:44.745
- I got it.
- "Audience members aren't allowed up here.

1133
00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:48.035
Let's say a couple of Super
Junior members went on the show.

1134
00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:52.199
For example, Lee Teuk, Shindong and
Eun-hyuk and you were on the show.

1135
00:53:53.535 --> 00:53:56.714
Ho-dong said, "You try too".
He didn't know your name.

1136
00:53:57.215 --> 00:53:58.721
He called you Ryeowook.

1137
00:53:58.746 --> 00:54:01.596
Instead of calling you Ye-sung,
he called you Ye-seung.

1138
00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:03.511
He kept calling you Ye-seung.

1139
00:54:03.652 --> 00:54:05.140
- Ye-seung.
- Ye-seung.

1140
00:54:05.363 --> 00:54:08.074
Daddy! I can't live without you.

1141
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:09.824
- Ye-seung.
- Daddy!

1142
00:54:10.387 --> 00:54:13.449
(He imitates Ha Jung-woo
and even Ryu Seung-ryong)

1143
00:54:13.809 --> 00:54:18.464
"You should concentrate on your singing
instead of doing variety shows".

1144
00:54:18.582 --> 00:54:22.464
He blatantly said that
on the show as a joke.

1145
00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:26.902
- That's supposed to be a joke?
- It doesn't seem funny.

1146
00:54:27.004 --> 00:54:28.252
- I got it.
- Answer.

1147
00:54:28.277 --> 00:54:32.371
You tried doing something and he said,
"Does this seem like a joke to you?".

1148
00:54:32.457 --> 00:54:34.890
Wow. That's taking it a bit too far.

1149
00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:38.925
(He begins to worry as the
misunderstanding grows)

1150
00:54:39.004 --> 00:54:40.371
That's going too far.

1151
00:54:40.473 --> 00:54:43.089
That makes it seem like he's some gangster.

1152
00:54:43.692 --> 00:54:44.692
(Getting mad)

1153
00:54:45.496 --> 00:54:49.519
The answer is something that would
come after what Hee-chul just said.

1154
00:54:49.926 --> 00:54:54.527
- I wonder what it is. - It would be hard
to say, even if you knew the answer.

1155
00:54:54.621 --> 00:54:58.019
I'm afraid it'll be more awkward
for you two after this question.

1156
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:02.683
"Don't say that during the recording, go
home and say it. What the heck is this?".

1157
00:55:03.706 --> 00:55:06.121
- It's kind of similar.
- That sounds more like Kyung-kyu.

1158
00:55:06.238 --> 00:55:08.808
- "Go home!".
- His voice sounds like Kyung-kyu.

1159
00:55:09.004 --> 00:55:10.230
It's a mixture.

1160
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:15.402
Ye-sung's voice tone doesn't go with
variety shows since it's a bit low.

1161
00:55:15.715 --> 00:55:16.715
"Yes, yes".

1162
00:55:17.386 --> 00:55:20.871
- That's the tone of your voice and...
- Can I throw this at him?

1163
00:55:21.371 --> 00:55:24.996
Your voice was depressing, so he
said, "What are you saying?".

1164
00:55:25.059 --> 00:55:28.136
You answered with your voice and he
asked again, "What are you saying?".

1165
00:55:28.161 --> 00:55:29.161
(Bang)

1166
00:55:30.481 --> 00:55:31.781
(Keeps at it)

1167
00:55:32.246 --> 00:55:34.414
(Let's see how far you want to take this)

1168
00:55:34.488 --> 00:55:35.859
You voice tone is...

1169
00:55:36.004 --> 00:55:37.304
(I told you to stop!)

1170
00:55:37.598 --> 00:55:40.089
He said something very standard.

1171
00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:44.558
- It's easier than you think.
- I got it! I got it!

1172
00:55:44.738 --> 00:55:46.894
Remember, I was much younger.

1173
00:55:47.035 --> 00:55:50.011
Back then, Ho-dong was worked
for a different agency than us.

1174
00:55:50.238 --> 00:55:52.995
So, when you tried answering a question...

1175
00:55:53.301 --> 00:55:56.886
"Why does the agency keep
sending this untalented kid?".

1176
00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.504
"I don't even like that agency company".

1177
00:56:01.027 --> 00:56:04.898
"I've never liked the chairman,
Lee Soo-man, in the first place".

1178
00:56:05.176 --> 00:56:07.674
"I don't know how that
company still exists".

1179
00:56:07.699 --> 00:56:11.518
"I wouldn't work for that company, even
if they gave me a million dollars".

1180
00:56:11.543 --> 00:56:13.260
(Hee-chul knows how to get to Ho-dong)

1181
00:56:13.285 --> 00:56:18.402
I got it. There was an opportunity for
Ye-sung to say a specific line but...

1182
00:56:18.434 --> 00:56:20.355
- you kept mumbling.
- Yes.

1183
00:56:20.793 --> 00:56:24.948
He said, "You shouldn't talk that way.
Talk properly, if you're going talk".

1184
00:56:24.973 --> 00:56:26.568
- "Yes, yes".
- (Getting mad)

1185
00:56:26.593 --> 00:56:30.491
This could make sense because if you
mumble something, I would say...

1186
00:56:30.516 --> 00:56:34.152
"That's great. Try not to come
on any more variety shows".

1187
00:56:34.434 --> 00:56:36.159
- That's probably what I did.
- Is that right?

1188
00:56:36.184 --> 00:56:41.277
No. I was actually very aggressive when I
was on the show and would yell, "I got it".

1189
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:43.198
- "I got it".
- I got it!

1190
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:44.481
Say, "I got it".

1191
00:56:45.371 --> 00:56:46.371
I got it!

1192
00:56:47.113 --> 00:56:49.355
"Stop trying to be a know-it-all".

1193
00:56:50.903 --> 00:56:53.925
(You should stop trying to
answer questions, Hee-chul)

1194
00:56:54.637 --> 00:56:57.566
That's too mean. It's
similar, but way too mean.

1195
00:56:57.723 --> 00:56:59.629
- It's similar?
- It is, but it's too mean.

1196
00:56:59.654 --> 00:57:02.013
- This isn't mean enough?
- He did yell, but...

1197
00:57:02.215 --> 00:57:03.215
"Hey!".

1198
00:57:04.934 --> 00:57:07.362
There's something more after that.
The tone is similar.

1199
00:57:07.387 --> 00:57:10.523
"Hey! Does your boss
live in Namchun-dong?".

1200
00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:12.895
What's with the act?

1201
00:57:12.981 --> 00:57:15.745
(They're busy showing off their
mimicking talents instead of the answer)

1202
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:18.800
- I needed to show them.
- What are you guys doing?

1203
00:57:18.934 --> 00:57:19.934
I got it.

1204
00:57:20.535 --> 00:57:23.339
- I got it.
- He pulled your arm out.

1205
00:57:27.574 --> 00:57:29.814
(This is more of a horror show
instead of a variety show)

1206
00:57:29.824 --> 00:57:31.846
You lifted your arm and he pulled it out?

1207
00:57:31.871 --> 00:57:36.175
- He might have three or four arms at home.
- Those are his trophies.

1208
00:57:37.043 --> 00:57:38.816
"I told you to stay quiet!".

1209
00:57:39.559 --> 00:57:42.773
- "Be quiet and stay still!".
- "I told you stay quiet!".

1210
00:57:42.856 --> 00:57:44.597
- I got it.
- It's really simple.

1211
00:57:44.622 --> 00:57:46.215
- "Be quiet".
- You got it.

1212
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:50.425
Shout, "I got it" for me.

1213
00:57:51.699 --> 00:57:53.824
- I got it!
- "Can't you be quiet?".

1214
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.421
"Can't you be quiet?".

1215
00:57:55.543 --> 00:57:57.030
"Can't you be quiet?".

1216
00:57:58.924 --> 00:58:00.707
You criticized him! Shame on you!

1217
00:58:00.949 --> 00:58:03.964
(New Break: Kang Ho-dong will be
making an important statement soon)

1218
00:58:04.074 --> 00:58:05.718
I can't take that back.

1219
00:58:06.207 --> 00:58:09.160
I'm totally done for. I
can't make that funny.

1220
00:58:09.606 --> 00:58:12.668
My reputation is gone. No moving
story can change this.

1221
00:58:12.761 --> 00:58:13.961
Good-bye everyone.

1222
00:58:14.756 --> 00:58:17.675
It's been fun, hasn't it? I've
had fun being on television.

1223
00:58:17.949 --> 00:58:20.722
I can't save my reputation.
Good-bye everyone.

1224
00:58:20.988 --> 00:58:21.988
(He hides first)

1225
00:58:22.106 --> 00:58:24.964
I'll come visit some other time.
I'll be going.

1226
00:58:25.348 --> 00:58:26.847
(Please leave comfortably)

1227
00:58:26.942 --> 00:58:29.605
- Bye. - One person is finally
getting fired from the show.

1228
00:58:29.762 --> 00:58:32.597
Good-bye everyone! It's
been nice working with you.

1229
00:58:33.621 --> 00:58:36.152
Take good care of the
show and the other kids.

1230
00:58:37.199 --> 00:58:38.671
(Gets thrown out)

1231
00:58:38.976 --> 00:58:41.538
You need to leave your uniform here!

1232
00:58:42.145 --> 00:58:44.370
Does this mean Shindong will
be sitting there next week?

1233
00:58:44.395 --> 00:58:47.808
Shindong, you can take Ho-dong's chair.
You'll be called Shin Ho-dong.

1234
00:58:48.035 --> 00:58:49.925
(Very ill at ease)

1235
00:58:50.067 --> 00:58:53.662
- Do you think I'll be okay? - The real
question here is how will he return?

1236
00:58:53.687 --> 00:58:56.957
How will the grand prize-winner
for variety shows return?

1237
00:58:57.192 --> 00:59:01.613
- How will a national emcee return to the
show? - That's right, a national emcee.

1238
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:05.785
Now, will everyone call out his name again?

1239
00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:07.987
- Is this "Love is in the Air"?
- Can we call him Ho-dong?

1240
00:59:08.012 --> 00:59:10.011
One, two...

1241
00:59:11.067 --> 00:59:13.574
- Three!
- Ho-dong!

1242
00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:16.734
(He sings his own background music)

1243
00:59:17.285 --> 00:59:18.824
- Let's call him again.
- Ho-dong!

1244
00:59:18.949 --> 00:59:21.511
- Ho-dong!
- Let try again, but louder!

1245
00:59:22.356 --> 00:59:24.668
- Ye-sung needs to call him.
- Ho-dong!

1246
00:59:24.996 --> 00:59:26.578
Let try again, but louder!

1247
00:59:26.856 --> 00:59:29.859
- Ye-sung needs to call him.
- Ho-dong!

1248
00:59:30.902 --> 00:59:32.933
- Is he here?
- Hello.

1249
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:35.504
- Is he here?
- Hello.

1250
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:37.871
Hello, my name is Ho-min.

1251
00:59:38.043 --> 00:59:39.956
(A new transfer student named Ho-min)

1252
00:59:39.981 --> 00:59:41.910
- Ho-dong!
- Hello.

1253
00:59:43.027 --> 00:59:45.172
Another transfer student is here.

1254
00:59:45.645 --> 00:59:46.914
Wow, that's funny.

1255
00:59:47.543 --> 00:59:49.824
(Ho-dong becomes Ho-min with just a mole)

1256
00:59:50.324 --> 00:59:51.691
It's nice to meet you.

1257
00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:54.175
Aren't you Dong-hae from Super Junior?

1258
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:55.777
Where did Ho-dong go?

1259
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:59.425
- I saw him running away crying.
- I see.

1260
00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:01.472
He seemed really upset.

1261
01:00:01.668 --> 01:00:04.585
I heard him saying he was
going to kill Ye-sung.

1262
01:00:04.856 --> 01:00:08.328
He really did say he was going to kill him.
He wasn't joking.

1263
01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:10.432
- Ye-sung should be careful.
- Yes.

1264
01:00:10.457 --> 01:00:12.363
My goodness. What are we going to do?

1265
01:00:12.393 --> 01:00:15.683
- He drew that mole on with a marker.
- Let's tread softly.

1266
01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:18.613
You guys know how Ho-dong is.

1267
01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:21.848
He probably said, "Can you be
quiet" very nicely, but since it was...

1268
01:00:21.873 --> 01:00:24.533
Ye-sung's first variety show,
he took it the wrong way.

1269
01:00:24.558 --> 01:00:26.160
He thought, "Did I do something wrong?".

1270
01:00:26.449 --> 01:00:29.386
Ye-sung is the type to over-think things.

1271
01:00:29.457 --> 01:00:35.488
I think it became even worse as time
passed by and he kept thinking about it.

1272
01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.644
- What was the situation? - It just
got worse. Am I that kind of person?

1273
01:00:39.762 --> 01:00:41.714
- You're not like that.
- I think time made it worse.

1274
01:00:41.793 --> 01:00:45.175
You imagined it that way and
now it's become a reality.

1275
01:00:45.285 --> 01:00:48.343
- It became his reality.
- Am I the only one who felt that way?

1276
01:00:48.809 --> 01:00:50.799
It's okay, Ye-sung. At
least he didn't hit you.

1277
01:00:50.824 --> 01:00:53.441
It's okay, Ye-sung. At
least he didn't hit you.

1278
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.968
(New Break: Kang Ho-min will be
making an important statement soon)

1279
01:00:59.262 --> 01:01:03.308
It's been fun while it lasted. It's
been fun for the last two-years.

1280
01:01:05.074 --> 01:01:06.550
It's alright, I'm okay.

1281
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:10.640
Lose weight and do better.
Be good as Shin Ho-dong.

1282
01:01:10.863 --> 01:01:13.378
- You can take my chair.
- This is pretty nice.

1283
01:01:13.824 --> 01:01:17.191
Thanks a lot. Thanks for biting
the hand that feeds you.

1284
01:01:17.216 --> 01:01:20.175
- Is he going to show up with two moles?
- Sorry guys.

1285
01:01:20.606 --> 01:01:24.546
- Take good care of the kids.
- You might need to color your whole face.

1286
01:01:24.793 --> 01:01:27.800
- You guys should visit the island I'm on.
- We will.

1287
01:01:27.856 --> 01:01:30.293
- See you later.
- Damn you!

1288
01:01:31.418 --> 01:01:33.043
(Hurry and get out of here)

1289
01:01:35.422 --> 01:01:37.980
Is he going to show up with another mole?

1290
01:01:38.168 --> 01:01:40.479
Don't you think he'll
show up without a mole?

1291
01:01:40.504 --> 01:01:42.605
We got him twice.

1292
01:01:43.356 --> 01:01:45.019
Alright, I'll see you later.

1293
01:01:45.044 --> 01:01:47.324
(Ho-dong is chased out again)

1294
01:01:49.093 --> 01:01:51.289
(Ho-dong has nowhere to go)

1295
01:01:51.965 --> 01:01:55.015
What am I going to do? I can't
put another mole on my face.

1296
01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:56.800
Do something for me, hurry.

1297
01:01:56.934 --> 01:01:59.230
Doesn't anyone have an idea or way?

1298
01:02:01.324 --> 01:02:03.472
Why did I leave in the first place?

1299
01:02:04.981 --> 01:02:09.207
I heard a new comedian will be
introduced to "Ask Us Anything".

1300
01:02:09.348 --> 01:02:12.160
- Really?
- Yeah, his name is Kang Goo.

1301
01:02:12.223 --> 01:02:13.808
Kang Goo! We have Sang-goo too.

1302
01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:15.800
I heard he beat out a lot of competitors.

1303
01:02:15.902 --> 01:02:17.816
Why is he so late?

1304
01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:20.605
- Kang Goo!
- Let's try calling him again.

1305
01:02:21.004 --> 01:02:23.136
Call Kang Goo really loud.

1306
01:02:23.387 --> 01:02:25.777
Now, one, two, three!

1307
01:02:25.988 --> 01:02:26.988
Kang Goo!

1308
01:02:28.152 --> 01:02:31.324
- Now, one, two, three!
- Kang Goo!

1309
01:02:35.738 --> 01:02:37.410
Kang Goo isn't here.

1310
01:02:38.737 --> 01:02:39.737
(Approves)

1311
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:41.130
(Standing ovation)

1312
01:02:42.621 --> 01:02:44.730
Kang Goo is here!

1313
01:02:44.832 --> 01:02:47.480
He usually doesn't do this for everyone.

1314
01:02:47.606 --> 01:02:50.291
He must've been in a hurry
to do a comedy skit.

1315
01:02:50.504 --> 01:02:52.457
- It was funny.
- Come over here.

1316
01:02:52.848 --> 01:02:54.964
- All my respects to you.
- Thank you.

1317
01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:58.385
- Is that cotton?
- No, it's toothpaste. It's stinging me.

1318
01:02:58.918 --> 01:03:01.206
- I thought it was cotton.
- Hurry, it hurts.

1319
01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:04.682
(Everyone is impressed with
Ho-dong's toothpaste make up)

1320
01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:09.254
He might have told me to stay quiet, but
I did a lot of shows after with Ho-dong.

1321
01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.964
To be honest, after that happened...

1322
01:03:12.473 --> 01:03:16.699
he said, "The reason I got mad is for
you to be more aggressive on shows".

1323
01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:20.284
He knew how hard it was for me to be
on variety shows with my team members.

1324
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:23.675
I really like him since he's
given me a lot of good advice.

1325
01:03:24.035 --> 01:03:27.285
(Even if you...)

1326
01:03:27.488 --> 01:03:29.605
(regret it now...)

1327
01:03:29.777 --> 01:03:30.777
Wait a second!

1328
01:03:31.012 --> 01:03:35.183
(It's of no use now)

1329
01:03:36.574 --> 01:03:38.324
Sang-min!

1330
01:03:38.762 --> 01:03:40.964
Don't you remember Ye-sung?

1331
01:03:41.981 --> 01:03:42.981
- Me?
- Yeah.

1332
01:03:43.496 --> 01:03:45.128
Haven't you seen Ye-sung before?

1333
01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:46.254
Where?

1334
01:03:46.762 --> 01:03:47.762
When did I see him?

1335
01:03:47.926 --> 01:03:50.441
- A long time ago.
- A show called "Cart Bar".

1336
01:03:50.466 --> 01:03:52.338
I went on the show as a
guest, don't you remember?

1337
01:03:52.363 --> 01:03:54.769
- "Cart Bar"?
- Please say he was mean too.

1338
01:03:54.887 --> 01:03:56.261
(Please say he was mean too)

1339
01:03:56.504 --> 01:04:00.019
I was a guest on their first
episode with Sang-min...

1340
01:04:00.496 --> 01:04:05.793
The hosts were Sang-min and Kim Gura.
Kim Tae-won was on the show as well.

1341
01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:08.746
- Tae-won was a guest as well.
- Please, please.

1342
01:04:09.168 --> 01:04:11.378
Sang-min came a bit late
since he was really busy.

1343
01:04:11.426 --> 01:04:14.417
Jung-hwan kept joking around with
me and when I saw Sang-min...

1344
01:04:14.442 --> 01:04:19.941
I got up really quickly and yelled, "Why
are you here now? Aren't you too late?".

1345
01:04:20.512 --> 01:04:22.347
As soon as he came in...

1346
01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.479
he said, "Who the heck is he?".

1347
01:04:24.504 --> 01:04:26.335
"Who the heck is he?".

1348
01:04:28.449 --> 01:04:29.449
That's rude.

1349
01:04:29.606 --> 01:04:33.695
(News Break: Lee Sang-min will be
making an important announcement)

1350
01:04:35.196 --> 01:04:37.585
(The giant doorman is quite busy today)

1351
01:04:38.772 --> 01:04:40.742
(He gets a marker ready for make up)

1352
01:04:40.767 --> 01:04:43.065
(Thank you for all your work, Lee Sang-min.
From the staff at "Ask Us Anything".

1353
01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:45.246
Super Junior was hot back then too.

1354
01:04:45.863 --> 01:04:47.057
"Who the heck is he?".

1355
01:04:47.082 --> 01:04:49.027
Ho-dong's words are
nothing compared to this.

1356
01:04:49.168 --> 01:04:51.918
I think your brand will be damaged by this.

1357
01:04:52.356 --> 01:04:54.011
This isn't good news for him.

1358
01:04:55.346 --> 01:04:56.346
I really don't remember.

1359
01:04:56.371 --> 01:04:59.367
I'll only see you on "My Ugly Duckling".

1360
01:05:00.277 --> 01:05:01.277
Get out!

1361
01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:05.199
How many people is Ye-sung
going to put out of business?

1362
01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:07.988
- "Who the heck is this?".
- We need to be nice to Ye-sung.

1363
01:05:08.184 --> 01:05:09.184
- Yeong-cheol.
- Yeah?

1364
01:05:09.246 --> 01:05:10.855
Don't you remember?

1365
01:05:11.371 --> 01:05:14.046
Is this the last episode
of "Ask Us Anything?".

1366
01:05:14.113 --> 01:05:15.354
Do we all need to get out?

1367
01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:16.877
(The last episode of "Ask Us Anything")

1368
01:05:16.902 --> 01:05:19.299
Wait a second, I've never
seen Ye-sung before.

1369
01:05:19.324 --> 01:05:22.371
- He's never seen you before?
- Just get out. - Get out!

1370
01:05:22.449 --> 01:05:24.879
- Do I have to leave?
- No, I was just joking.

1371
01:05:25.231 --> 01:05:27.770
- He was joking.
- A round of applause.

1372
01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:31.613
I heard a new singer is going
to be on "Ask Us Anything".

1373
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.621
- I heard their group name was Rola.
- What is it? - Rola.

1374
01:05:34.793 --> 01:05:37.074
- Rola?
- Was the group scared?

1375
01:05:37.324 --> 01:05:40.410
- Now, the new singer, Rola!
- Rola!

1376
01:05:40.613 --> 01:05:41.613
Come on out!

1377
01:05:47.879 --> 01:05:50.535
(It wasn't Rola, but Park Sang-min?)

1378
01:05:52.253 --> 01:05:53.941
(Singing as hard as he can)

1379
01:05:55.254 --> 01:05:58.527
I saw Lee Sang-min leaving,
but he was crying.

1380
01:05:59.301 --> 01:06:01.785
Why was Sang-min crying?

1381
01:06:03.246 --> 01:06:04.691
I really don't remember.

1382
01:06:05.074 --> 01:06:07.472
- I really did that?
- It was 10-years ago.

1383
01:06:07.582 --> 01:06:11.176
- It's been 10-years already?
- That's when you were ruthless.

1384
01:06:12.606 --> 01:06:14.605
I'll start my questions.

1385
01:06:14.973 --> 01:06:21.894
If I see this one thing, I'm willing to
give the other person everything I possess.

1386
01:06:22.262 --> 01:06:23.980
I'm sure I know this. Answer!

1387
01:06:24.621 --> 01:06:26.281
Your girlfriend's love.

1388
01:06:26.738 --> 01:06:28.441
"Dong-hae, I love you".

1389
01:06:28.871 --> 01:06:30.291
No, it's not a saying.

1390
01:06:30.465 --> 01:06:31.871
- Your friend.
- Friendship.

1391
01:06:32.082 --> 01:06:33.082
Kiss.

1392
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:36.722
- It's similar.
- Belief, hope, love.

1393
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:38.270
I'll say...

1394
01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.455
when you see eye-to-eye...

1395
01:06:42.043 --> 01:06:43.167
you'll give everything up.

1396
01:06:43.192 --> 01:06:45.496
- When you see eye-to-eye?
- Yes, when you fall in love.

1397
01:06:45.621 --> 01:06:48.043
Will you do something about that mole?

1398
01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.268
Your charisma goes out
the door with that mole.

1399
01:06:51.293 --> 01:06:54.199
- I got it!
- I'd give everything if I fell in love.

1400
01:06:54.332 --> 01:06:55.332
Give us a hint.

1401
01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:59.451
You're willing to give everything
when you see someone crying.

1402
01:07:00.238 --> 01:07:02.920
Some people lie when they're crying though.

1403
01:07:03.035 --> 01:07:04.769
It's something similar to that.

1404
01:07:04.848 --> 01:07:08.095
- When they smile with their eyes, you...
- That's you.

1405
01:07:08.863 --> 01:07:10.416
I'm wrong, aren't I?

1406
01:07:10.668 --> 01:07:14.779
Will being on "Ask Us Anything" be
of any help for our album promotion?

1407
01:07:15.059 --> 01:07:17.261
A meaningful kiss!

1408
01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:20.746
What if a guy is asking him something?

1409
01:07:20.817 --> 01:07:25.120
You're willing to give them everything,
if you think the kiss was meaningful.

1410
01:07:25.145 --> 01:07:28.129
- It's wrong, but the meaningful
part is right. - Really?

1411
01:07:28.467 --> 01:07:30.285
A meaningful look!

1412
01:07:32.824 --> 01:07:34.799
- Is that right?
- You'd know if it was meaningful?

1413
01:07:34.824 --> 01:07:37.302
- You're right!
- How would you know that?

1414
01:07:37.504 --> 01:07:39.730
- How can you tell a look is meaningful?
- What's that?

1415
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:42.943
My life motto is to not
ignore people in need.

1416
01:07:43.012 --> 01:07:46.324
I'm not the type to only
look out for myself.

1417
01:07:47.317 --> 01:07:50.129
That's my motto. An
incident happened when...

1418
01:07:50.824 --> 01:07:54.566
a junior high school friend of
mine, was in really bad place.

1419
01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:57.127
He was going through a rough time.

1420
01:07:57.199 --> 01:07:59.793
He said, "I'm going to start a store...

1421
01:08:01.363 --> 01:08:04.363
but could you just help
me, this one time?".

1422
01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:10.386
The amount of help he was asking
was a bit too much for me.

1423
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:12.361
Suddenly, my friend...

1424
01:08:12.902 --> 01:08:15.355
began thinking and looked at me...

1425
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:18.621
and said, "Just once".

1426
01:08:19.707 --> 01:08:21.365
As soon as he did that...

1427
01:08:22.488 --> 01:08:24.097
I couldn't stop myself from helping him.

1428
01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:27.463
- You did? What happened?
- They're in a lawsuit right now.

1429
01:08:28.168 --> 01:08:29.886
He's suing his friend?

1430
01:08:30.168 --> 01:08:31.871
That was great timing.

1431
01:08:32.434 --> 01:08:34.495
(His timing is good enough
for a standing ovation)

1432
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.384
Everyone should worship Ye-sung.

1433
01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:39.222
- Good job.
- That was a good one.

1434
01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:41.495
You finally made people
laugh, it only took 13 years.

1435
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.785
- Finally!
- Yes, after 13 years!

1436
01:08:44.199 --> 01:08:46.629
See? Ho-dong isn't telling you
to keep quiet any longer.

1437
01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:49.292
- It took him less than a second.
- Look over there, Ye-sung.

1438
01:08:49.317 --> 01:08:52.388
- Go over there for your ceremony.
- Yes, do a ceremony.

1439
01:08:52.413 --> 01:08:54.049
(He dances what Ho-dong likes seeing)

1440
01:08:54.074 --> 01:08:55.330
Are you impersonating Ho-dong?

1441
01:08:55.355 --> 01:09:00.261
Ye-sung doesn't stand for great vocal
chords, but a holy man of variety shows.

1442
01:09:01.629 --> 01:09:03.599
A holy man of variety shows?

1443
01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.910
He rose to fame by dissing
all of his colleagues.

1444
01:09:07.207 --> 01:09:08.558
Did you get your money back?

1445
01:09:08.637 --> 01:09:11.793
Well, it was quite a large amount of money.

1446
01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:16.050
I wanted to help my friend even
if I might lose all my money.

1447
01:09:16.199 --> 01:09:21.824
I wanted to trust my friend, but I vowed
never to do it again if it failed.

1448
01:09:22.543 --> 01:09:25.918
I wanted to trust him and
fortunately, his business succeeded.

1449
01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:27.511
What a relief.

1450
01:09:27.559 --> 01:09:31.957
That's how he repaid me for
the money I let him borrow.

1451
01:09:32.223 --> 01:09:34.417
- He's successful now.
- Wait a second.

1452
01:09:34.442 --> 01:09:37.076
Did you lie about him suing his friend?

1453
01:09:38.465 --> 01:09:40.605
You're so mean. That's scary.

1454
01:09:41.137 --> 01:09:44.371
- I thought you were telling the truth.
- I though he was in a lawsuit.

1455
01:09:44.535 --> 01:09:47.581
We would've believed the lawsuit
if we just passed the story.

1456
01:09:47.606 --> 01:09:49.209
I'll see you later, Ye-sung.

1457
01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:50.841
It was actually a happy ending.

1458
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:54.166
Variety shows need to be honest as well.
What happened?

1459
01:09:54.402 --> 01:09:57.502
I wanted to be acknowledged
by you, even if I had to lie.

1460
01:09:57.793 --> 01:10:00.939
I wanted to be acknowledged
by you, even if I had to lie.

1461
01:10:02.379 --> 01:10:03.862
(He's taken aback by
Ye-sung's sudden attack)

1462
01:10:03.887 --> 01:10:07.988
Why don't you try being nice to the kid?
He's starting to lie on purpose.

1463
01:10:08.387 --> 01:10:11.402
(He really needs to leave again)

1464
01:10:11.637 --> 01:10:14.527
Stop going away. I'm tired
of opening the door for you.

1465
01:10:14.809 --> 01:10:18.862
Go sit down! You don't have anything
else to do with your face anyways.

1466
01:10:18.887 --> 01:10:20.222
There's no more make up.

1467
01:10:20.309 --> 01:10:23.518
- Ye-sung was so nice, but he's starting
to lie. - We've got a big problem.

1468
01:10:23.543 --> 01:10:26.722
This is a classic example of loving
your children the wrong way.

1469
01:10:26.824 --> 01:10:28.549
He wanted to be acknowledged by Ho-dong.

1470
01:10:28.574 --> 01:10:32.699
It's a relief to hear you got your
money back. Next time, get collateral.

1471
01:10:33.098 --> 01:10:37.011
- That's good. - He wouldn't borrow
money from him, if he had collateral.

1472
01:10:37.106 --> 01:10:40.339
- He doesn't have any collateral.
- Well, that's true.

1473
01:10:40.364 --> 01:10:42.674
He went to ask you since he
didn't have any collateral.

1474
01:10:42.699 --> 01:10:44.323
If he doesn't have collateral...

1475
01:10:44.348 --> 01:10:47.041
Next time, ask him for a promissory note.

1476
01:10:48.012 --> 01:10:49.440
He would've gone to the
bank if he had collateral.

1477
01:10:49.465 --> 01:10:52.418
Try to pick one person, who
has the most meaningful look.

1478
01:10:52.574 --> 01:10:55.823
- Only the "Ask Us Anything" members.
- Yeah, since he already knows us.

1479
01:10:55.848 --> 01:10:58.369
Show me your most meaningful looks.

1480
01:10:58.745 --> 01:11:00.912
My whole posture is meaningful.

1481
01:11:01.067 --> 01:11:02.067
I'm very honest.

1482
01:11:02.213 --> 01:11:05.449
- What are you honest about?
- What's wrong with his face.

1483
01:11:05.613 --> 01:11:09.646
(Which one of the "Ask Us Anything" member
will have the most meaningful look?)

1484
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:11.941
I'd like to see Soo-geun's looks.

1485
01:11:13.543 --> 01:11:14.543
Well...

1486
01:11:14.981 --> 01:11:17.674
could you help me, just this once?
Please, Ye-sung?

1487
01:11:17.699 --> 01:11:19.269
(Ye-sung is sitting over here)

1488
01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:22.785
- Ye-sung is over here.
- I'm Ye-sung.

1489
01:11:22.996 --> 01:11:24.845
I was talking to you.

1490
01:11:25.465 --> 01:11:29.121
You look at other places when you talk.
I was just looking over there.

1491
01:11:29.754 --> 01:11:32.081
I'm curious if anyone has done the same.

1492
01:11:32.106 --> 01:11:36.293
Was there a situation or person that
made you want to give everything to?

1493
01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.362
Honestly, I've done that
with members in our group.

1494
01:11:39.387 --> 01:11:41.629
That's why I only lend money to our group.

1495
01:11:41.934 --> 01:11:43.104
You've lent money to someone?

1496
01:11:43.129 --> 01:11:44.611
I lent money to Shindong.

1497
01:11:44.699 --> 01:11:49.511
I've let a lot of people borrow money, but
he's the only person that has paid me back.

1498
01:11:50.192 --> 01:11:52.082
- I borrowed money from you too.
- I know.

1499
01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:53.863
How come you borrowed so much money?

1500
01:11:53.981 --> 01:11:56.105
Are you a gambler, Shindong?

1501
01:11:56.449 --> 01:11:59.105
- How much did you borrow from them?
- He did a lot of things.

1502
01:11:59.707 --> 01:12:02.621
He opened a lot of different businesses.

1503
01:12:02.817 --> 01:12:04.527
- He opened a PC room as well.
- Yes, the PC room.

1504
01:12:04.637 --> 01:12:06.746
It didn't work out, but
I paid everyone back.

1505
01:12:06.839 --> 01:12:08.832
We shouldn't quit our day jobs.

1506
01:12:08.926 --> 01:12:11.779
I feel bad, but I haven't
paid back one person.

1507
01:12:12.652 --> 01:12:14.699
I wish you'd pay me back quicker.

1508
01:12:15.892 --> 01:12:16.892
(Laughing)

1509
01:12:17.895 --> 01:12:20.885
I knew he paid them back, but
I haven't been paid back yet.

1510
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:22.542
I'll pay you back, don't worry.

1511
01:12:22.567 --> 01:12:24.823
Maybe he just more
comfortable with Eun-hyuk.

1512
01:12:24.848 --> 01:12:30.410
I got to learn about each member of Super
Junior's thoughts through this show.

1513
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:32.769
- I'm jealous.
- I found out a lot about them.

1514
01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:34.800
It's Shindong's turn now!

1515
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.091
- Shindong is last to go.
- You guys are amazing.

1516
01:12:38.293 --> 01:12:40.957
It's not easy lending
money to other people.

1517
01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:43.824
- It's hard lending money to friends.
- I know.

1518
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:46.206
I'll give you guys questions,
try to get it right.

1519
01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:50.738
There was a time when I really
hated the members in our group.

1520
01:12:52.012 --> 01:12:53.012
When was that?

1521
01:12:53.192 --> 01:12:54.979
When they made fun of you for being fat.

1522
01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:56.004
Being fat? No.

1523
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:59.377
When we didn't like you or
when you didn't like us?

1524
01:12:59.402 --> 01:13:00.732
What?

1525
01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:02.199
When we hated you?

1526
01:13:02.356 --> 01:13:04.986
There was a time when I
hated each one of you.

1527
01:13:05.199 --> 01:13:08.177
When they told you to
go back to North Korea?

1528
01:13:08.491 --> 01:13:09.491
(Lost for words)

1529
01:13:09.856 --> 01:13:12.823
You finally made it over and
started to make a living too.

1530
01:13:12.848 --> 01:13:18.058
When people clap normally for everyone
else, but only clap sideways for you.

1531
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:22.418
- No. - When they bring over your clothes.
- What about my clothes?

1532
01:13:22.652 --> 01:13:25.589
All of the other members
get nice clothes since...

1533
01:13:26.637 --> 01:13:29.980
they're all slim and in shape.

1534
01:13:30.192 --> 01:13:33.980
- That's possible. - There isn't
a lot of clothes you can wear...

1535
01:13:34.356 --> 01:13:37.410
so, they brought clothes that
weren't nice or it was ripped.

1536
01:13:37.606 --> 01:13:41.127
They made you wear clothes that
were altered or strange-looking.

1537
01:13:41.348 --> 01:13:45.629
When you guys go on-stage,
they look nice except for you.

1538
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:47.740
Has that happened to you before?

1539
01:13:48.246 --> 01:13:49.871
It's happened on this show.

1540
01:13:50.152 --> 01:13:53.355
No, that's not a reason for
me to hate the members.

1541
01:13:53.637 --> 01:13:56.121
- You guys aren't even close.
- I got it.

1542
01:13:57.207 --> 01:13:59.519
Before you became a member...

1543
01:13:59.926 --> 01:14:02.183
you needed to order 3 to
4 dishes for yourself...

1544
01:14:02.285 --> 01:14:04.121
No, it was when we were together already.

1545
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:05.270
Okay, pass.

1546
01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:08.433
- Okay, pass?
- No, never mind.

1547
01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:12.933
- When we first started, we all
lived together. - That's right.

1548
01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:15.167
- You're right.
- I got it.

1549
01:14:15.192 --> 01:14:19.027
When you lived together and something
smelled, they all looked at you.

1550
01:14:19.262 --> 01:14:22.097
- No, that was definitely Eun-hyuk.
- Fart smells?

1551
01:14:22.371 --> 01:14:23.371
Fart smells?

1552
01:14:23.785 --> 01:14:27.043
When we put in a dirty sock
for your birthday drink.

1553
01:14:27.106 --> 01:14:28.537
(Trying to remember)

1554
01:14:28.785 --> 01:14:32.238
- Did we do that? - That was my
birthday. You put his sock in my drink.

1555
01:14:32.371 --> 01:14:36.455
- That was Ye-sung's birthday. - I had
Shindong's sock in my birthday drink.

1556
01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:41.293
- Did you drink it? - You were all living
together. - Yes, discomfort from that.

1557
01:14:41.488 --> 01:14:44.793
You guys were living together, but
when there was anything missing...

1558
01:14:44.988 --> 01:14:50.261
from the refrigerator, they would
say, "When did you eat all of it?".

1559
01:14:50.543 --> 01:14:52.511
- But you didn't eat it.
- That could be.

1560
01:14:52.652 --> 01:14:56.355
Did that happen? It's not the answer,
but I think it could've happened.

1561
01:14:56.598 --> 01:14:59.027
Your clothes are a lot
bigger, so the members...

1562
01:14:59.231 --> 01:15:02.248
thought they were pajamas
and kept wearing it to bed.

1563
01:15:02.418 --> 01:15:04.457
- You got it!
- Really?

1564
01:15:04.731 --> 01:15:07.449
- You're exactly right.
- Are you serious?

1565
01:15:07.598 --> 01:15:09.339
Those were clothes you wanted wear out.

1566
01:15:09.402 --> 01:15:13.838
That's what I'm talking about. I'm sure
the rest of the guys don't know this.

1567
01:15:14.012 --> 01:15:17.011
- I bought clothes and they
were precious to me. - Really?

1568
01:15:17.231 --> 01:15:20.168
It had characters that I really loved.

1569
01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:23.265
I took time and patience
to pick out my clothes...

1570
01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:25.988
and it was a white shirt
I wanted to wear out.

1571
01:15:26.262 --> 01:15:27.799
I understand what you're saying.

1572
01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:30.847
That shirt cost me about $180 to buy.

1573
01:15:30.996 --> 01:15:34.238
It was really expensive and it was a
time when I didn't have much money.

1574
01:15:34.356 --> 01:15:38.629
I wore it once, washed it and
put it on the liner to dry but...

1575
01:15:38.856 --> 01:15:42.941
one of the members wore it to bed
and I saw him the next morning.

1576
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:46.347
- It was Dong-hae.
- Lee Dong-hae did that the most!

1577
01:15:46.496 --> 01:15:48.910
He was the one who did it the most.

1578
01:15:49.043 --> 01:15:50.243
They all wore it like pajamas?

1579
01:15:50.299 --> 01:15:54.563
Yeah, since all my shirts were super
big they wore it like pajamas.

1580
01:15:54.588 --> 01:15:55.862
Yeah, it would've been comfortable.

1581
01:15:55.887 --> 01:15:58.050
That was really hard on me.

1582
01:15:58.176 --> 01:16:01.714
No one wore my clothes,
they used it as blankets.

1583
01:16:02.449 --> 01:16:04.914
- They used it to cover themselves?
- Yeah.

1584
01:16:05.012 --> 01:16:09.199
Maybe it's my personality, but I
couldn't get myself to tell them.

1585
01:16:09.449 --> 01:16:10.976
I really didn't know.

1586
01:16:11.043 --> 01:16:13.199
I really hated my member back then.

1587
01:16:13.301 --> 01:16:15.222
When did you ever like us?

1588
01:16:16.621 --> 01:16:18.379
(Let me think about that)

1589
01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:20.886
Do you even like the
members on Super Junior?

1590
01:16:20.934 --> 01:16:22.292
Tell us what you like about us.

1591
01:16:22.317 --> 01:16:23.972
I like them all, I do but...

1592
01:16:24.074 --> 01:16:27.418
I've talked about this a
lot with them before.

1593
01:16:27.707 --> 01:16:30.308
We would make less mistakes if
we kept everything business...

1594
01:16:30.356 --> 01:16:34.254
but everyone in our group like
to do things like a family.

1595
01:16:34.746 --> 01:16:36.863
Shindong is more like a New Yorker.

1596
01:16:37.043 --> 01:16:38.972
- I kind of am.
- He's a cool guy.

1597
01:16:39.106 --> 01:16:41.315
He's likes to separate
business and pleasure.

1598
01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:44.324
That's why I got into a lot of
trouble from Dong-hae before.

1599
01:16:44.449 --> 01:16:48.223
He cursed at me over the phone, telling
me not to think the way I did.

1600
01:16:48.386 --> 01:16:49.987
Dong-hae did the same to me too.

1601
01:16:50.129 --> 01:16:53.402
- Is Dong-hae on the passionate side?
- Totally.

1602
01:16:53.668 --> 01:16:55.543
He'll get mad and start crying.

1603
01:16:56.067 --> 01:17:01.019
For instance, he'll get say, "Shindong!
We still need to stick together...

1604
01:17:01.519 --> 01:17:03.510
and act like a family. Shouldn't we?".

1605
01:17:03.543 --> 01:17:04.995
Bingo! That's right!

1606
01:17:05.949 --> 01:17:08.043
He's right. He always does that.

1607
01:17:08.175 --> 01:17:11.534
- He doesn't give us time to get mad.
- It's because he's sensitive.

1608
01:17:11.559 --> 01:17:15.515
He'll get mad and say, "Ye-sung!
What the heck is wrong with you?".

1609
01:17:16.277 --> 01:17:17.351
(Sniffling)

1610
01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:19.363
He gets mad and curses but...

1611
01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:20.831
He gets emotionally involved.

1612
01:17:20.856 --> 01:17:24.136
You try to react to what he
says, but can't do anything.

1613
01:17:24.285 --> 01:17:25.674
We start to feel bad.

1614
01:17:25.699 --> 01:17:29.285
It's because I get emotionally
attached and when I think about it...

1615
01:17:29.473 --> 01:17:30.473
I start to cry.

1616
01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:35.839
- That's why. - I've been watching him
and I can see his passion. - I know.

1617
01:17:36.067 --> 01:17:37.769
It's an emotional passion.

1618
01:17:38.012 --> 01:17:42.519
Yunho might show his passion through
noise, but Dong-hae shows it with tears.

1619
01:17:42.652 --> 01:17:43.652
That's right.

1620
01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:44.924
It's personality differences.

1621
01:17:44.949 --> 01:17:50.543
Why don't you tell each one us what
you don't like about that person?

1622
01:17:52.395 --> 01:17:55.996
I really hate one thing about Eun-hyuk.
I can't stand it!

1623
01:17:56.137 --> 01:17:58.601
I really wanted to say this to him.
I hate it.

1624
01:17:58.683 --> 01:18:03.011
When we go to karaoke rooms, he always
sings the songs I put in for myself!

1625
01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.338
- I know what you're saying.
- He's too much.

1626
01:18:05.363 --> 01:18:10.668
When he's drunk, he thinks it's his song
and doesn't even let me sing with him.

1627
01:18:10.863 --> 01:18:12.691
- He doesn't let go of the mic.
- Never.

1628
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:14.752
I don't have a lot of opportunity to sing.

1629
01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:17.101
I don't have a lot of opportunity to sing.

1630
01:18:17.786 --> 01:18:19.769
I have even less parts than you!

1631
01:18:20.145 --> 01:18:22.738
- I have less parts.
- I don't have a lot of opportunities.

1632
01:18:22.981 --> 01:18:25.940
- I have less parts than you.
- You have to be understanding.

1633
01:18:25.965 --> 01:18:26.965
You win.

1634
01:18:27.332 --> 01:18:28.651
I don't have a lot of parts.

1635
01:18:28.676 --> 01:18:30.146
What about Dong-hae?

1636
01:18:30.387 --> 01:18:31.387
Dong-hae?

1637
01:18:31.652 --> 01:18:35.074
- I'm still a bit uncomfortable
when we're alone. - For 13-years?

1638
01:18:35.606 --> 01:18:38.097
How about we go out for a meal together?

1639
01:18:38.238 --> 01:18:39.808
He doesn't like that!

1640
01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:42.957
He already said he wanted to
keep it more business-like.

1641
01:18:43.059 --> 01:18:45.214
(Everyone is so serious)

1642
01:18:45.824 --> 01:18:48.293
He doesn't like talking
to people by himself.

1643
01:18:48.395 --> 01:18:52.730
Now that I think about it, I think
good-looking people have a certain swag.

1644
01:18:52.887 --> 01:18:54.425
That's odd of you to say.

1645
01:18:54.606 --> 01:18:58.324
- Shindong and I have never
eaten together. - Never.

1646
01:18:58.504 --> 01:19:00.099
I keep asking to go eat with me but...

1647
01:19:00.124 --> 01:19:02.792
How did you borrow money,
when you won't eat with him?

1648
01:19:02.817 --> 01:19:04.849
I asked him through the phone.

1649
01:19:06.043 --> 01:19:08.277
I should call him if I need something.

1650
01:19:08.598 --> 01:19:10.708
He's seriously driving me crazy.

1651
01:19:10.981 --> 01:19:14.831
How did you verify his meaningful
look when you were on the phone?

1652
01:19:14.856 --> 01:19:17.644
- He just trusted Shindong.
- Yeah, we're in the same group.

1653
01:19:17.738 --> 01:19:19.915
- It wasn't a large amount.
- That's right.

1654
01:19:20.059 --> 01:19:21.059
That's funny.

1655
01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:24.643
Wait, why did you guys ask us to come here?

1656
01:19:24.707 --> 01:19:27.855
We should get our competition
going if we're all here.

1657
01:19:28.121 --> 01:19:30.855
Why do the kids who come
here, think we're so easy?

1658
01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.168
How come they always
want to compete with us?

1659
01:19:33.199 --> 01:19:35.281
How come this spider won't come off?

1660
01:19:35.996 --> 01:19:36.996
(Dusting off)

1661
01:19:37.449 --> 01:19:38.839
This is bothering me.

1662
01:19:39.129 --> 01:19:42.214
He only thinks about making
commercials when he's awake.

1663
01:19:42.402 --> 01:19:45.170
I wanted to see how the
members of "Ask Us Anything"...

1664
01:19:45.195 --> 01:19:47.573
and Super Junior competed
against one another.

1665
01:19:47.598 --> 01:19:50.464
We brought some activities
we were confident about.

1666
01:19:50.551 --> 01:19:53.191
- Please win us.
- We'll win, no matter what.

1667
01:19:53.301 --> 01:19:55.332
What will happen if we win?

1668
01:19:55.426 --> 01:19:58.230
I don't like doing this, but if we win...

1669
01:19:58.606 --> 01:20:00.504
- Our title song...
- Yes, "Black Suit".

1670
01:20:00.668 --> 01:20:03.511
Let us sing "Black Suit" on
the show for the audience.

1671
01:20:03.574 --> 01:20:06.424
- As of now, it's black sweats.
- What if you lose?

1672
01:20:06.449 --> 01:20:09.152
If you lose, you guys have
to buy us all a suit.

1673
01:20:09.715 --> 01:20:11.245
- Black suits.
- No.

1674
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:13.402
- One that costs $399.00.
- Why not?

1675
01:20:13.574 --> 01:20:15.074
I don't have any money.

1676
01:20:15.204 --> 01:20:16.204
Oh, really?

1677
01:20:16.598 --> 01:20:20.034
- You didn't get the money Shindong
borrowed. - I'll grant you a wish instead.

1678
01:20:20.059 --> 01:20:23.042
I already told you, my wish
is for you to buy me a suit.

1679
01:20:23.067 --> 01:20:25.050
Wait. Is it right for Hee-chul to be there?

1680
01:20:25.223 --> 01:20:29.460
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Should I be Jang
Sung-kyu for today since he's not here?

1681
01:20:29.832 --> 01:20:31.668
The PE teacher is here!

1682
01:20:31.926 --> 01:20:32.926
He's here.

1683
01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.722
I was running late. Jang Sung-kyu is here.

1684
01:20:35.801 --> 01:20:37.362
- You look hung over.
- No, I'm not.

1685
01:20:37.387 --> 01:20:38.588
Come here, let me see.

1686
01:20:38.613 --> 01:20:41.410
- When are you going to lose weight?
- I already lost 6 pounds.

1687
01:20:41.481 --> 01:20:43.629
- The three of us are the same age.
- Really?

1688
01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:45.269
- Really?
- Long time no see.

1689
01:20:45.387 --> 01:20:46.882
He's a year older than me?

1690
01:20:47.012 --> 01:20:49.963
How does a teacher only come to
school once every two months?

1691
01:20:49.988 --> 01:20:52.393
- I'm don't know either.
- Don't you come to work every day?

1692
01:20:52.418 --> 01:20:54.183
I'd like to come every day as well.

1693
01:20:54.434 --> 01:20:56.355
Let me introduce myself!

1694
01:20:56.567 --> 01:21:00.863
I'm your physical education
teacher, Professor Jang!

1695
01:21:01.004 --> 01:21:02.004
Okay, fine.

1696
01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:03.987
(Welcome, Professor Jang)

1697
01:21:04.012 --> 01:21:07.386
- That was good. - No one is happy to
see him. - What are we doing today?

1698
01:21:07.504 --> 01:21:11.261
The "Ask Us Anything" team will go
up against the Super Junior team.

1699
01:21:11.286 --> 01:21:13.557
Super Junior versus the
"Ask Us Anything" team...

1700
01:21:13.582 --> 01:21:16.917
in a 99-second teamwork competition!

1701
01:21:17.628 --> 01:21:21.034
- It's been a long time since we played
this. - We're really at this game.

1702
01:21:21.059 --> 01:21:24.129
The first mission is to
put a pencil in a bottle.

1703
01:21:24.154 --> 01:21:28.544
Put a band on your head that's attached
with a pencil and turn five times.

1704
01:21:28.569 --> 01:21:31.636
If you put the pencil in the
bottle after this, you pass.

1705
01:21:31.934 --> 01:21:36.074
The second mission is to play jacks and
catch all five jacks in one catch.

1706
01:21:36.457 --> 01:21:39.160
The third mission is to guess
a person through action.

1707
01:21:39.254 --> 01:21:42.855
Read the person's name on the sketch book
and use expression and movement for clues.

1708
01:21:43.012 --> 01:21:45.183
You'll have three chances to guess right.

1709
01:21:45.481 --> 01:21:48.269
The fourth mission is to pop five balloons.

1710
01:21:48.434 --> 01:21:51.089
You'll only pass if you
pop them with your butt.

1711
01:21:51.293 --> 01:21:54.745
The last mission is to pass a
ball while jumping rope together.

1712
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:58.254
You'll win the game if the last
person puts the ball in the basket.

1713
01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:00.121
"Ask Us Anything" team will go first.

1714
01:22:00.199 --> 01:22:02.362
Figure out who will perform each mission.

1715
01:22:02.387 --> 01:22:04.488
I'll be the person to play jacks.

1716
01:22:04.856 --> 01:22:06.786
I'll do jacks since I'm good at it.

1717
01:22:06.863 --> 01:22:08.879
- Your hands are too small.
- I'm good.

1718
01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:11.691
- You're good?
- I'll turn five-times.

1719
01:22:11.934 --> 01:22:14.688
(Unexpectedly, Ho-dong
decides to play jacks)

1720
01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:17.542
Let's see the "Ask Us Anything" team win.

1721
01:22:17.567 --> 01:22:18.863
Let's finish on our first try, Ho-dong.

1722
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:20.940
Don't drag this out, let's
finish on our first try.

1723
01:22:20.965 --> 01:22:22.167
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

1724
01:22:22.192 --> 01:22:23.511
I'm starting.

1725
01:22:23.934 --> 01:22:25.362
- I'm starting.
- Okay.

1726
01:22:25.387 --> 01:22:26.387
Start!

1727
01:22:28.689 --> 01:22:31.019
- Four, five.
- He's fast. He's going fast.

1728
01:22:32.067 --> 01:22:33.924
- Look at Kyung-hoon.
- It has to go in the bottle.

1729
01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:36.729
- That takes a long time.
- It needs concentration.

1730
01:22:36.754 --> 01:22:38.621
- It looks really difficult.
- He's got it.

1731
01:22:38.785 --> 01:22:42.261
- He's got this.
- I saw the staff trying this all morning.

1732
01:22:43.723 --> 01:22:45.207
- Let's get it.
- Almost.

1733
01:22:45.457 --> 01:22:49.035
Take your time, Kyung-hoon.
Go slowly and be precise.

1734
01:22:50.003 --> 01:22:52.597
- Let's go!
- You only have one chance.

1735
01:22:55.514 --> 01:22:58.028
- Okay.
- Good, you need to finish this.

1736
01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:02.270
- He has to do it again.
- You have to start all-over.

1737
01:23:02.652 --> 01:23:04.987
- Hurry, start turning.
- What's wrong with you, Ho-dong?

1738
01:23:05.012 --> 01:23:06.760
(A flurry of criticism)

1739
01:23:06.785 --> 01:23:09.363
Four, five. Do it again.

1740
01:23:09.839 --> 01:23:12.754
- We have plenty of time.
- Kyung-hoon is the only one suffering.

1741
01:23:12.831 --> 01:23:15.028
The first time was just an exercise.

1742
01:23:15.442 --> 01:23:18.004
- I need to stop the pencil first.
- That's a good idea.

1743
01:23:18.098 --> 01:23:20.542
- We can copy him.
- The pencil can't touch the ground.

1744
01:23:20.567 --> 01:23:21.567
It's a great idea.

1745
01:23:21.598 --> 01:23:23.402
It's in! Next mission!

1746
01:23:24.012 --> 01:23:26.893
Jacks is the easiest. He's the
one who said he wanted to do it.

1747
01:23:26.918 --> 01:23:28.635
That's good. They're on nicely.

1748
01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:32.438
You need to succeed, so we can see
what the other mission are like.

1749
01:23:32.785 --> 01:23:33.785
(He fails again)

1750
01:23:34.027 --> 01:23:36.972
- You kept bothering me!
- It's all your fault.

1751
01:23:37.168 --> 01:23:38.504
Let me do it!

1752
01:23:38.637 --> 01:23:40.262
"Ask Us Anything" Team, fail!

1753
01:23:40.442 --> 01:23:41.825
(All for nothing)

1754
01:23:42.106 --> 01:23:44.972
No one behind you could
try out their mission!

1755
01:23:46.356 --> 01:23:47.356
(Upset)

1756
01:23:47.863 --> 01:23:50.566
(How come everyone is so mean to me?)

1757
01:23:50.988 --> 01:23:54.831
- You're not allowed to practice!
- I'm disappointed in you, Ho-dong.

1758
01:23:54.856 --> 01:23:56.963
(Ho-dong and Yeong-cheol change missions)

1759
01:23:56.988 --> 01:23:57.988
I'll turn the rope.

1760
01:23:58.285 --> 01:24:00.582
- Okay, let's go!
- Be careful.

1761
01:24:01.488 --> 01:24:04.105
- Are you ready?
- Let's say a cheer first.

1762
01:24:04.231 --> 01:24:06.338
Yeah, let's say a cheer before we start.

1763
01:24:06.363 --> 01:24:08.589
Dong-hae is always passionate.

1764
01:24:09.129 --> 01:24:11.347
- One, two, three.
- Kill everyone!

1765
01:24:11.848 --> 01:24:13.597
(Their team cheer is brutal)

1766
01:24:14.488 --> 01:24:16.785
- Lee Teuk, let's go!
- Go for it!

1767
01:24:17.587 --> 01:24:20.011
One, two, three...

1768
01:24:20.356 --> 01:24:21.996
- Aren't you turning too fast?
- Five!

1769
01:24:22.059 --> 01:24:23.268
He turned five-times.

1770
01:24:23.293 --> 01:24:25.508
- Wow, this is...
- It's not easy, is it?

1771
01:24:25.668 --> 01:24:28.346
- It's not easy.
- You have plenty of time. Concentrate.

1772
01:24:28.371 --> 01:24:29.871
You have plenty of time.

1773
01:24:30.254 --> 01:24:33.254
- Slowly. - It's touching the floor!
- It's okay, if it touches the floor.

1774
01:24:33.473 --> 01:24:35.660
- Go slowly.
- He's almost got it.

1775
01:24:37.223 --> 01:24:39.136
- Let's do this!
- Don't laugh!

1776
01:24:39.379 --> 01:24:40.825
What's taking so long?

1777
01:24:41.089 --> 01:24:43.551
(The pencil starts moving
again due to Eun-hyuk's laugh)

1778
01:24:43.895 --> 01:24:45.315
Is there a magnetic field there?

1779
01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:48.940
- There's a magnetic field for the pencil.
- Put your hands behind your back!

1780
01:24:48.965 --> 01:24:50.910
What the heck are you doing?

1781
01:24:51.598 --> 01:24:53.149
(The time keeps passing)

1782
01:24:53.911 --> 01:24:56.539
(It looks like it might
go in, but it might not)

1783
01:24:56.934 --> 01:24:59.534
Kyung-hoon was a
professional at this sport.

1784
01:24:59.559 --> 01:25:01.438
I'm starting to get frustrated.

1785
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:04.230
- Pass!
- This is harder than it looks!

1786
01:25:04.598 --> 01:25:07.558
I kept getting three-dimensional
effect from it.

1787
01:25:08.457 --> 01:25:11.027
- You have to start again.
- Five times around.

1788
01:25:11.215 --> 01:25:13.988
- That must be hard.
- 1, 2, 3...

1789
01:25:14.317 --> 01:25:16.144
4, 5.

1790
01:25:16.871 --> 01:25:18.824
You're allowed to use the floor.

1791
01:25:19.074 --> 01:25:21.621
I can't tell distance
or dimension from here.

1792
01:25:21.676 --> 01:25:23.410
Concentrate. Don't talk.

1793
01:25:23.574 --> 01:25:25.511
- You're almost there.
- Oh, no.

1794
01:25:26.832 --> 01:25:29.868
- This is really hard.
- I'm about to have an anxiety attack.

1795
01:25:29.957 --> 01:25:30.957
(Screaming)

1796
01:25:32.152 --> 01:25:33.723
- Got it!
- He got it.

1797
01:25:34.012 --> 01:25:36.434
- We're finished.
- No, we still have time.

1798
01:25:37.113 --> 01:25:38.813
- Fail!
- What are you doing?

1799
01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:40.985
I thought you were good at playing jack!

1800
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:43.606
(These jacks are different than mine)

1801
01:25:43.762 --> 01:25:45.910
(In the end, Lee Teuk decides to play jacks)

1802
01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.316
These jacks don't work very well.

1803
01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:51.237
- It's not about being dizzy.
- Not every can do that.

1804
01:25:51.262 --> 01:25:53.957
It's okay to change missions if
you can't play the game well.

1805
01:25:54.067 --> 01:25:56.347
- Concentrate.
- Let's do this!

1806
01:25:57.176 --> 01:25:59.105
- You can't talk.
- Who is going to play jacks?

1807
01:25:59.246 --> 01:26:01.902
- Let me try one more time.
- No, you're done.

1808
01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:05.801
- Get ready to concentrate.
- "Ask Us Anything" Team! Start!

1809
01:26:06.808 --> 01:26:09.246
- Three, four.
- Five!

1810
01:26:09.645 --> 01:26:13.324
- Stop it from moving with the floor.
- Kyung-hoon is so good.

1811
01:26:14.707 --> 01:26:16.852
It's okay, we have plenty of time.

1812
01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.980
- Good, Kyung-hoon.
- Pass!

1813
01:26:19.277 --> 01:26:21.222
- Let's go.
- Fail!

1814
01:26:21.754 --> 01:26:23.536
How could you fail that?

1815
01:26:24.192 --> 01:26:27.743
- Is there a hidden camera on me?
- How can you fail that?

1816
01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.183
- You were fine before, what happened?
- I should go slowly.

1817
01:26:32.410 --> 01:26:34.276
This is turning into a one-two act.

1818
01:26:34.301 --> 01:26:36.488
- Slowly, Kyung-hoon.
- You have plenty of time.

1819
01:26:36.676 --> 01:26:38.957
Good, good, good. You're doing well. Good.

1820
01:26:39.129 --> 01:26:40.875
He's stopped it from moving.

1821
01:26:41.004 --> 01:26:43.183
- Put it in the bottle.
- Good job, you got it.

1822
01:26:43.223 --> 01:26:45.011
- Dang it.
- He said, "Dang it".

1823
01:26:45.207 --> 01:26:46.207
Pass!

1824
01:26:47.043 --> 01:26:50.332
- Yeong-cheol's turn.
- The teacher said, "Dang it".

1825
01:26:51.366 --> 01:26:53.777
You can only use movement and expression.

1826
01:26:54.942 --> 01:26:56.602
Jun Hyun-moo!

1827
01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.010
(They go to the fourth mission)

1828
01:26:59.035 --> 01:27:01.261
Fail! You can only pop them with your butt!

1829
01:27:01.379 --> 01:27:03.918
- You can only use your butt!
- Kyung-hoon!

1830
01:27:04.442 --> 01:27:06.582
You fail, "Ask Us Anything" Team!

1831
01:27:06.902 --> 01:27:09.206
- You're only supposed to use your butt.
- Wait.

1832
01:27:09.231 --> 01:27:10.941
I didn't use my hands or feet!

1833
01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:14.457
Now, it looks like the jacks
mission is the hardest.

1834
01:27:14.918 --> 01:27:17.682
- They changed members.
- Do well with the jacks!

1835
01:27:17.707 --> 01:27:19.527
Jacks is the most important stage.

1836
01:27:19.824 --> 01:27:22.925
Let's go, Super Junior Team. Get ready!

1837
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:26.574
It's harder if you turn faster.

1838
01:27:27.473 --> 01:27:29.175
Four, five.

1839
01:27:30.348 --> 01:27:32.152
It's over. 30-seconds have passed.

1840
01:27:32.262 --> 01:27:35.081
- Go, he's lying.
- Try standing with a wider stance!

1841
01:27:35.106 --> 01:27:37.831
- Go more, more, more, more.
- You forgot to turn once.

1842
01:27:37.856 --> 01:27:40.776
- Wait a second. - Go in straight!
- The pencil is still.

1843
01:27:40.801 --> 01:27:42.899
- Come up slowly.
- I can't watch this anymore.

1844
01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:45.989
- You're kind of bad at this.
- It's there! Put it in!

1845
01:27:46.387 --> 01:27:47.387
Pass!

1846
01:27:47.824 --> 01:27:50.050
- Good job.
- He's already ready.

1847
01:27:50.168 --> 01:27:52.175
- Be careful.
- Fail!

1848
01:27:52.387 --> 01:27:55.011
- Start again, Eun-hyuk!
- Go ahead, start turning!

1849
01:27:55.551 --> 01:27:58.246
- Change with me.
- Three, four!

1850
01:27:58.418 --> 01:27:59.973
I don't think I can do this.

1851
01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.996
- He's got it.
- He seems a bit better this time.

1852
01:28:03.442 --> 01:28:05.386
- Pass!
- He did it faster this time.

1853
01:28:05.496 --> 01:28:07.800
- Get ready.
- They've gotten used to it.

1854
01:28:08.067 --> 01:28:09.067
Good.

1855
01:28:09.621 --> 01:28:11.277
Pass! Very good!

1856
01:28:13.035 --> 01:28:14.886
Lee Young-ja!

1857
01:28:15.184 --> 01:28:16.184
He got it right!

1858
01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.104
(They go quickly to the fourth mission)

1859
01:28:18.129 --> 01:28:20.371
- Over there. - That's two!
- Over here.

1860
01:28:20.449 --> 01:28:21.964
- Get ready to turn the rope.
- Three!

1861
01:28:22.043 --> 01:28:24.191
- Who's turning the ropes?
- Last one.

1862
01:28:25.192 --> 01:28:26.192
That's five!

1863
01:28:26.918 --> 01:28:29.957
- It doesn't matter who, hurry.
- Jump in.

1864
01:28:30.402 --> 01:28:32.496
This is your last mission!

1865
01:28:33.442 --> 01:28:35.946
- Who throws the ball in?
- The very last person.

1866
01:28:36.098 --> 01:28:37.777
You're doing great. Good!

1867
01:28:37.926 --> 01:28:39.938
(Everyone gets in safely)

1868
01:28:40.447 --> 01:28:42.754
(They need to pass the ball
to the front of the row)

1869
01:28:42.848 --> 01:28:45.058
(Totally excited)

1870
01:28:45.598 --> 01:28:46.598
You've got this!

1871
01:28:46.763 --> 01:28:49.496
(Will they succeed after only two tries?)

1872
01:28:51.595 --> 01:28:52.595
(Shoot, goal!)

1873
01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:53.620
Fail!

1874
01:28:54.473 --> 01:28:57.807
- What? We failed? - You put the ball
in after you got caught on the rope.

1875
01:28:57.832 --> 01:29:00.222
- It's a shame, but you failed!
- It wasn't me.

1876
01:29:00.527 --> 01:29:02.691
(They grab anyone and blame it on them)

1877
01:29:04.698 --> 01:29:08.387
(The person who failed the
mission was Dong-hae)

1878
01:29:09.168 --> 01:29:11.074
That was a total fail.

1879
01:29:12.308 --> 01:29:14.472
- How can you say it was a total fail?
- Sorry.

1880
01:29:14.567 --> 01:29:15.567
That was close.

1881
01:29:16.035 --> 01:29:18.097
We'll start your round right away.

1882
01:29:18.457 --> 01:29:20.691
- Ready!
- (Start)

1883
01:29:21.223 --> 01:29:22.730
One, two...

1884
01:29:23.035 --> 01:29:24.910
three, four...

1885
01:29:25.027 --> 01:29:26.629
five!

1886
01:29:27.465 --> 01:29:29.799
- He's good. - Kyung-hoon is
finding it difficult as well.

1887
01:29:29.824 --> 01:29:32.925
You look like the grandpa that turns
well on "Capture the Moments".

1888
01:29:33.183 --> 01:29:36.699
- Now, now. Be careful.
- Try your best. Try your best.

1889
01:29:36.988 --> 01:29:39.097
Ry your best. Try your best.

1890
01:29:39.824 --> 01:29:41.035
(He shows his class)

1891
01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.137
This will end their streak.

1892
01:29:43.715 --> 01:29:44.715
Pass!

1893
01:29:45.692 --> 01:29:47.722
Only through your actions.

1894
01:29:48.457 --> 01:29:50.250
- I know what it is.
- What is it?

1895
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:52.133
(3. Getting angry)

1896
01:29:52.723 --> 01:29:54.464
- Lee Kyung-kyu!
- Pass!

1897
01:29:54.668 --> 01:29:57.096
- Get ready.
- It was from "Let's Have Dinner Together".

1898
01:29:57.121 --> 01:29:59.674
(Like an intense attack, they're
on their fourth mission)

1899
01:29:59.699 --> 01:30:01.276
They're going too fast.

1900
01:30:01.301 --> 01:30:04.386
- It's okay, we have time.
- Go slowly, take your time.

1901
01:30:04.527 --> 01:30:07.144
- Get yourselves ready.
- We have plenty of time.

1902
01:30:08.152 --> 01:30:11.331
- Why are you going in that direction?
- We have time. - Come in!

1903
01:30:11.356 --> 01:30:13.324
- Go slowly. - No!
- Come on in!

1904
01:30:13.472 --> 01:30:16.394
Are you going to put the ball in?
Are you putting the ball in?

1905
01:30:16.567 --> 01:30:18.328
Is it time for me to go in?

1906
01:30:18.692 --> 01:30:20.174
We're doing good. Great!

1907
01:30:20.199 --> 01:30:22.024
- Go forward.
- Pass the ball.

1908
01:30:22.301 --> 01:30:24.597
- No, you can't win!
- Don't do it!

1909
01:30:24.715 --> 01:30:26.328
(We can't lose like this)

1910
01:30:26.488 --> 01:30:28.719
(He begins to fiddle with his hair)

1911
01:30:29.801 --> 01:30:31.731
(Yeong-cheol gets caught in the ropes)

1912
01:30:31.871 --> 01:30:34.235
Why didn't you take the ball earlier?

1913
01:30:34.567 --> 01:30:35.567
(Has no excuses)

1914
01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:39.184
Yeong-cheol! You failed
because of your hair part!

1915
01:30:40.473 --> 01:30:43.293
- I don't think we can do this.
- I can't see because of my hair.

1916
01:30:43.426 --> 01:30:45.028
I should go tie my hair.

1917
01:30:45.129 --> 01:30:48.714
And also, why is Yeong-cheol
at the very end?

1918
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:50.691
He ran to the very front.

1919
01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.930
- He did it by himself?
- Yes.

1920
01:30:53.387 --> 01:30:56.074
- I'm a good jumper.
- He wanted to be the winner today.

1921
01:30:56.246 --> 01:30:59.761
Don't you think it would be
nice for me to do the finale?

1922
01:30:59.902 --> 01:31:02.651
- Let's win it this time.
- Yeah, let's succeed!

1923
01:31:02.809 --> 01:31:05.645
(They failed the second-time by a
hair, they want to win this time)

1924
01:31:05.834 --> 01:31:07.677
- Let's finish this.
- Okay, let's go.

1925
01:31:07.702 --> 01:31:10.178
Get ready, Super Junior Team!

1926
01:31:10.319 --> 01:31:13.108
- Okay! One, two, three, four.
- He's much faster.

1927
01:31:13.452 --> 01:31:15.850
- Five! He's faster.
- Very good!

1928
01:31:15.928 --> 01:31:18.014
Eun-hyuk has started to
control the pencil. Good.

1929
01:31:18.217 --> 01:31:19.586
Try to put it in.

1930
01:31:19.733 --> 01:31:20.733
- Okay!
- Pass!

1931
01:31:20.967 --> 01:31:24.219
(They pass the first mission easily)

1932
01:31:25.569 --> 01:31:27.559
- Fail!
- What happened?

1933
01:31:28.202 --> 01:31:32.467
- You have plenty of time. - Jacks is
a lot harder than everyone thinks.

1934
01:31:32.492 --> 01:31:34.575
(He ties his hair with a
piece of popped balloon)

1935
01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:35.600
Eun-hyuk!

1936
01:31:37.116 --> 01:31:40.270
They'll have a hard time even
if Eun-hyuk puts that in.

1937
01:31:40.382 --> 01:31:42.623
It's now. Put it in now.

1938
01:31:42.811 --> 01:31:43.811
Good, Lee Teuk.

1939
01:31:44.436 --> 01:31:45.436
Pass!

1940
01:31:46.163 --> 01:31:47.163
Let's go, let's go.

1941
01:31:47.288 --> 01:31:49.428
Lee Hyo-ri!

1942
01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:50.600
Pass!

1943
01:31:51.116 --> 01:31:53.125
(While Ye-sung starts popping balloons...)

1944
01:31:53.217 --> 01:31:55.235
(They all get ready to jump rope)

1945
01:31:55.389 --> 01:31:56.826
Pass!

1946
01:31:57.225 --> 01:31:59.279
- Hurry, come in.
- I'm going.

1947
01:31:59.897 --> 01:32:02.638
- Who's going to go in first?
- We'll need to see the direction.

1948
01:32:02.663 --> 01:32:03.663
Fail!

1949
01:32:05.842 --> 01:32:08.891
(They fail due to Ye-sung
getting caught in the ropes)

1950
01:32:09.116 --> 01:32:11.756
- Ye-sung!
- I got dizzy from that.

1951
01:32:12.733 --> 01:32:15.930
He's so dumb! He was tired
of popping the balloons.

1952
01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.069
- Ye-sung should've gone in last.
- Ye-sung!

1953
01:32:19.249 --> 01:32:22.930
- He told me to jump first since
he's tired. - Are you guys ready?

1954
01:32:24.045 --> 01:32:27.841
- Who will be the last to jump for our
team? - Let's start this right away.

1955
01:32:27.866 --> 01:32:29.828
"Ask Us Anything" Team, get ready!

1956
01:32:29.884 --> 01:32:30.884
(Start!)

1957
01:32:31.651 --> 01:32:34.217
(Both teams have gotten
used to the missions...

1958
01:32:34.242 --> 01:32:36.696
who will make the least
amount of mistakes?)

1959
01:32:36.936 --> 01:32:38.662
Now, slowly, slowly.

1960
01:32:38.882 --> 01:32:42.170
- You have to lower your body for this.
- He spread his legs too much.

1961
01:32:42.671 --> 01:32:44.657
(He succeeds in one try)

1962
01:32:44.868 --> 01:32:46.008
(Admiration)

1963
01:32:46.033 --> 01:32:48.506
- We have plenty of time.
- We play jacks the best.

1964
01:32:48.811 --> 01:32:49.811
They're getting faster.

1965
01:32:50.069 --> 01:32:52.508
- You have to play jacks well.
- I do.

1966
01:32:53.795 --> 01:32:55.029
Yoo Jae-suk!

1967
01:32:56.256 --> 01:32:58.896
(He gives it his all to popping
balloons with his butt)

1968
01:32:58.921 --> 01:33:00.754
- They're really fast.
- You got it.

1969
01:33:00.811 --> 01:33:02.506
Now, start turning the rope.

1970
01:33:02.811 --> 01:33:05.934
The ball-thrower should go first.
We have 60-seconds left.

1971
01:33:06.053 --> 01:33:07.936
He's in first again?

1972
01:33:07.961 --> 01:33:11.172
He went in as soon as I asked
who will throw the ball in.

1973
01:33:11.998 --> 01:33:14.756
- Come closer to the front.
- Come in, come in!

1974
01:33:14.905 --> 01:33:18.302
- We're looking good. - Why does he
still have the pencil on his head?

1975
01:33:18.327 --> 01:33:20.481
Kyung-hoon is amazing, isn't he?

1976
01:33:21.366 --> 01:33:23.852
- No one knows yet.
- They haven't won yet.

1977
01:33:24.108 --> 01:33:26.754
(They succeed in giving
the last person the ball)

1978
01:33:26.874 --> 01:33:28.493
(Yeong-cheol shoots)

1979
01:33:31.382 --> 01:33:34.242
(They fail because of Yeong-cheol again)

1980
01:33:35.367 --> 01:33:38.629
- Who told you to throw the ball again?
- Let's do this guys!

1981
01:33:38.758 --> 01:33:39.926
You guys fail!

1982
01:33:40.391 --> 01:33:44.069
- Who's throwing the ball? - Yeong-cheol,
you failed because you tied your hair.

1983
01:33:44.094 --> 01:33:45.983
The person throwing the ball is important.

1984
01:33:46.008 --> 01:33:47.008
(Sinner)

1985
01:33:47.586 --> 01:33:51.223
- Soo-geun should throw the ball.
- Let's slowly move this way.

1986
01:33:51.593 --> 01:33:52.593
(Brick)

1987
01:33:52.618 --> 01:33:55.499
- Seo Jang-hoon can't even put it in.
- Don't turn the rope too fast.

1988
01:33:55.524 --> 01:33:58.428
- One, two, three, kill everyone!
- Let's start again.

1989
01:33:58.453 --> 01:34:01.723
- What the heck, Jang-hoon!
- Give me the ball again.

1990
01:34:02.242 --> 01:34:04.107
Shooting the basket is
harder than you think.

1991
01:34:04.132 --> 01:34:06.030
You missed six-times, Jang-hoon.

1992
01:34:06.133 --> 01:34:08.187
(This isn't easy at all)

1993
01:34:08.274 --> 01:34:10.351
Okay, okay. Let's go, let's go!

1994
01:34:10.602 --> 01:34:13.137
(Super Junior Team gets
another opportunity)

1995
01:34:13.195 --> 01:34:15.367
Let's say our cheer again.

1996
01:34:15.891 --> 01:34:17.836
One, two, three, kill everyone!

1997
01:34:18.344 --> 01:34:19.481
Run, run, run!

1998
01:34:19.984 --> 01:34:21.914
Let's show them our teamwork.

1999
01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:24.710
- You're running alone.
- I know, he abandoned me.

2000
01:34:24.719 --> 01:34:25.766
Ready!

2001
01:34:25.868 --> 01:34:26.868
Concentrate.

2002
01:34:27.227 --> 01:34:30.461
- Let's go, Eun-hyuk. - Good job!
- He's getting much faster.

2003
01:34:32.508 --> 01:34:35.686
- I like your speed. - Spread your legs
further. - Do you want me to do it for you?

2004
01:34:35.711 --> 01:34:38.301
- His legs need to be wider.
- That's great!

2005
01:34:38.664 --> 01:34:41.000
Hurry and flip it over. Flip it over.

2006
01:34:41.281 --> 01:34:42.281
Pass!

2007
01:34:42.821 --> 01:34:44.021
Good job, Lee Teuk.

2008
01:34:45.008 --> 01:34:47.235
- Choi Yang-rak?
- You got it!

2009
01:34:48.438 --> 01:34:50.781
- You've got time.
- Go slowly.

2010
01:34:51.281 --> 01:34:53.141
We got this, we got this.

2011
01:34:53.422 --> 01:34:54.422
Start!

2012
01:34:54.524 --> 01:34:56.465
- Go slowly.
- I'll go in first.

2013
01:34:57.998 --> 01:35:00.301
Good. Ye-sung looks good this time.

2014
01:35:00.586 --> 01:35:02.671
Hee-chul is turning the rope?

2015
01:35:02.758 --> 01:35:04.266
It's too fast!

2016
01:35:05.211 --> 01:35:06.882
You guys are swinging too fast.

2017
01:35:07.039 --> 01:35:10.265
- They're going super fast.
- You're going too fast!

2018
01:35:10.977 --> 01:35:13.887
- Go slower!
- It's too fast, it's too fast!

2019
01:35:15.045 --> 01:35:17.364
(Jump roping in lunacy)

2020
01:35:18.821 --> 01:35:20.640
(They drop the ball and fail)

2021
01:35:20.875 --> 01:35:22.953
- Fail!
- Why did you drop the ball!

2022
01:35:23.383 --> 01:35:25.211
- It's too fast.
- You need to go slower.

2023
01:35:25.328 --> 01:35:27.601
- It's too fast.
- It's your fault!

2024
01:35:27.742 --> 01:35:29.098
This is all your fault.

2025
01:35:29.305 --> 01:35:31.828
- Why did you turn it so fast?
- Kim Hee-chul!

2026
01:35:32.086 --> 01:35:35.739
- I'd like to compliment you!
- What the heck? Are you the X-man?

2027
01:35:35.883 --> 01:35:37.648
- X-man!
- You're swinging too fast.

2028
01:35:37.805 --> 01:35:39.546
Why did he turn it so fast?

2029
01:35:39.773 --> 01:35:42.430
You should've jumped faster
if we're turning it faster.

2030
01:35:42.455 --> 01:35:46.805
- We should've kept to our plan.
- We should move closer to the bucket.

2031
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.578
- We can slowly move toward the bucket.
- Okay.

2032
01:35:50.742 --> 01:35:54.015
- That's not against the rules.
- Yeah, let's move closer.

2033
01:35:54.227 --> 01:35:57.086
- I didn't think of that before.
- We can do that if we have time.

2034
01:35:57.111 --> 01:35:59.149
Are you telling us
you're going to cheat?

2035
01:35:59.174 --> 01:36:01.481
No, it's not cheating.
You can do it too.

2036
01:36:01.633 --> 01:36:04.077
You're going to move closer
while turning the rope?

2037
01:36:04.102 --> 01:36:06.421
- You can do it too.
- We can? - Yeah.

2038
01:36:06.703 --> 01:36:09.241
- Both teams have a chance.
- Good. That's good.

2039
01:36:09.266 --> 01:36:11.929
- This is our last chance.
- You can dunk it , if you want.

2040
01:36:12.016 --> 01:36:14.184
"Ask Us Anything" Team, get ready!

2041
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:15.270
(Start)

2042
01:36:15.594 --> 01:36:19.203
(He's so good, he could close
his eyes and turn around)

2043
01:36:20.305 --> 01:36:21.305
Five, okay.

2044
01:36:22.727 --> 01:36:24.975
- This isn't good.
- The pencil is caught!

2045
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.375
You can go as slowly as you need.

2046
01:36:27.766 --> 01:36:32.102
- Kyung-hoon is concentrating. - We need
to do well since they're used to this too.

2047
01:36:33.313 --> 01:36:36.239
- Pass! - He got it. We have
to admit that he's good.

2048
01:36:36.563 --> 01:36:37.563
Pass!

2049
01:36:37.672 --> 01:36:38.672
Passed by a hair.

2050
01:36:39.141 --> 01:36:41.840
- Isn't he good?
- What's that? Who is that?

2051
01:36:42.164 --> 01:36:44.859
Kim Yeong-cheol, Lee Young-ja, Ha Chun-hwa!

2052
01:36:45.742 --> 01:36:48.381
- He got it right.
- I got it right in three chances.

2053
01:36:48.406 --> 01:36:49.797
Let's do this!

2054
01:36:50.745 --> 01:36:52.867
Let's try to be quicker.

2055
01:36:53.024 --> 01:36:54.718
That's the hardest part.

2056
01:36:54.844 --> 01:36:56.789
Let's go, Kyung-hoon! Come in.

2057
01:36:56.945 --> 01:36:59.602
- What? I can't go in.
- No, you can. Come in.

2058
01:37:00.367 --> 01:37:02.465
Hurry! The next person needs to come in.

2059
01:37:02.531 --> 01:37:05.288
(His body slowly starts to
melt with ambiguous sounds)

2060
01:37:05.313 --> 01:37:08.164
Go toward the front. You need to move.

2061
01:37:08.664 --> 01:37:11.625
The first person to jump
needs to move closer.

2062
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:14.890
Let's move forward! Move little-by-little!

2063
01:37:15.524 --> 01:37:17.860
- Move forward.
- He wants us to move forward.

2064
01:37:17.961 --> 01:37:21.359
- Give the ball to Kyung-hoon!
- Good, go for it. - Move closer.

2065
01:37:21.546 --> 01:37:22.789
(What happened?)

2066
01:37:22.930 --> 01:37:24.570
Move closer.

2067
01:37:25.836 --> 01:37:26.836
(Goal)

2068
01:37:29.117 --> 01:37:32.789
"Ask Us Anything" Team finishes with
24.39-seconds left on the clock.

2069
01:37:33.563 --> 01:37:35.289
- Good job.
- We did well!

2070
01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:38.090
- It's 24.39-seconds.
- Job well-done.

2071
01:37:38.305 --> 01:37:40.414
(We were white-hot out there)

2072
01:37:41.211 --> 01:37:44.584
- You guys can get closer too.
- Do you want to put the ball in?

2073
01:37:44.609 --> 01:37:48.164
- This is our last chance.
- They're not going to beat us!

2074
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:51.898
- Let's do this.
- One, two, three, kill them all!

2075
01:37:52.024 --> 01:37:55.320
- Good. - You can win if you
beat our time of 24.39-seconds.

2076
01:37:55.438 --> 01:37:57.312
Okay, let's go, let's go!

2077
01:37:57.484 --> 01:37:59.093
- Let's go!
- Yes!

2078
01:37:59.422 --> 01:38:02.273
It's Super Junior Team's last chance.
Get ready!

2079
01:38:04.117 --> 01:38:06.148
(He turns even faster)

2080
01:38:06.375 --> 01:38:08.492
(He accidentally knocks over the bottle)

2081
01:38:08.727 --> 01:38:10.256
He touched the bottle with his hands.

2082
01:38:10.281 --> 01:38:11.608
He can stand it back up.

2083
01:38:11.633 --> 01:38:14.464
- Don't get flustered.
- His pencil might fly off next time.

2084
01:38:14.489 --> 01:38:17.053
- Very good, you're doing well.
- You need to do it on the first time.

2085
01:38:17.078 --> 01:38:20.758
- You have plenty of time.
- He can't make the pencil stop moving.

2086
01:38:20.938 --> 01:38:22.171
Pass!

2087
01:38:23.367 --> 01:38:24.367
Pass!

2088
01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:26.066
You're good. You have time.

2089
01:38:26.091 --> 01:38:27.656
(Shoots a gun, pulls back his hair)

2090
01:38:27.765 --> 01:38:29.804
- Won Bin.
- Pass!

2091
01:38:29.829 --> 01:38:32.379
- We got this! We got this!
- They're super fast!

2092
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:34.613
This is really hard.

2093
01:38:35.719 --> 01:38:37.476
- Last one.
- Okay, okay.

2094
01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:40.570
- This is your last mission.
- Take your time.

2095
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:42.914
- Go slowly.
- If you fail, we win.

2096
01:38:43.102 --> 01:38:46.312
(Will Super Junior be able to show
their cover song on the show?)

2097
01:38:46.422 --> 01:38:49.437
- Go slowly. - More, more, more.
- You're doing well!

2098
01:38:49.462 --> 01:38:52.774
- You have plenty of time.
- They're starting to jump faster!

2099
01:38:54.469 --> 01:38:58.445
(How will the game end?)

2100
01:39:00.313 --> 01:39:02.731
- You're doing well!
- You have plenty of time.

2101
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.700
They're starting to jump faster!

2102
01:39:06.015 --> 01:39:08.504
(How will the game end?)

2103
01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:10.977
Do it!

2104
01:39:16.772 --> 01:39:18.833
(Totally an absurd way to lose)

2105
01:39:19.125 --> 01:39:20.125
You failed!

2106
01:39:20.914 --> 01:39:22.629
He got caught on the jump rope.

2107
01:39:22.808 --> 01:39:25.169
You had over 40-seconds left on the clock.

2108
01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:28.140
I can't believe you guys lost to them.

2109
01:39:28.633 --> 01:39:32.757
The "Ask Us Anything" Team wins the
99-second mission competition!

2110
01:39:34.407 --> 01:39:36.180
I was in too much of a rush!

2111
01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.733
Just as I suspected. Lee Teuk really
is Kang Ho-dong's descendant.

2112
01:39:41.609 --> 01:39:43.289
He's your descendant.

2113
01:39:43.633 --> 01:39:47.179
(There are no regrets from either
side since they tried their best)

2114
01:39:47.914 --> 01:39:51.734
- Were you trying to be funny?
- No, I really tried my best.

2115
01:39:52.961 --> 01:39:57.867
Super Junior will now listen to each
member's wish on "Ask Us Anything".

2116
01:39:58.414 --> 01:40:02.093
I'm curious, we're not allowed
to sing our title song today?

2117
01:40:02.313 --> 01:40:03.313
That can't be true.

2118
01:40:03.945 --> 01:40:08.695
I'm allowed to tell Super Junior our
wish from "Ask Us Anything", right?

2119
01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:12.007
- What the heck?
- Get over on your side.

2120
01:40:12.234 --> 01:40:13.234
Youngest!

2121
01:40:13.789 --> 01:40:16.577
- Fine, fine.
- What were you going to say as your wish?

2122
01:40:16.602 --> 01:40:18.695
- I'd like to say a wish.
- What?

2123
01:40:18.719 --> 01:40:22.070
- What is it? - Today is our 100th
episode, I want Super Junior...

2124
01:40:22.211 --> 01:40:27.140
to show us their new title song since
they were nice to come on the show today!

2125
01:40:28.391 --> 01:40:29.545
(Ho-dong must be Solomon)

2126
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:32.609
That's not right. We need
to say our wish. No way!

2127
01:40:33.641 --> 01:40:37.132
Kang Ho-dong! Kang Ho-dong! Kang Ho-dong!

2128
01:40:38.125 --> 01:40:42.528
- Doesn't anyone have a wish? - I'd
like to say Buzz is starting our tour.

2129
01:40:44.727 --> 01:40:46.992
Next person. You can tell us your wish.

2130
01:40:47.258 --> 01:40:49.656
Of course, I'd like to
hear Super Junior's song.

2131
01:40:49.859 --> 01:40:52.750
I'd like to request, "Sorry, Sorry".

2132
01:40:53.172 --> 01:40:54.875
Super Junior!

2133
01:40:55.890 --> 01:40:57.702
You're going to split Super Junior's heads?

2134
01:40:57.727 --> 01:41:00.195
Isn't this the first time
singing on our show?

2135
01:41:01.735 --> 01:41:04.993
(Her beautiful backside
instantly grabs attention)

2136
01:41:05.496 --> 01:41:07.102
(She's here)

2137
01:41:07.477 --> 01:41:08.993
Don't I look pretty?

2138
01:41:09.219 --> 01:41:11.762
- You're just tall.
- I liked the back better.

2139
01:41:11.984 --> 01:41:14.211
Look, it's Kim Tae-won! Kim Tae-won!

2140
01:41:14.406 --> 01:41:17.047
You're so mean. Didn't you date a model?

2141
01:41:17.265 --> 01:41:18.851
You must've liked her.

2142
01:41:19.008 --> 01:41:20.554
This is the worst.

2143
01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:21.820
(Wind-up of fury)

2144
01:41:22.477 --> 01:41:23.795
This is frustrating.

2145
01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:25.772
Weren't you supposed to leave, Yeong-cheol?

2146
01:41:25.797 --> 01:41:29.039
I stopped watching after 10-minutes.
Buzz isn't what it used to be.

2147
01:41:29.477 --> 01:41:32.141
- Who the heck are you?
- Why are you here?

2148
01:41:32.664 --> 01:41:35.054
He looks like a deflated Ko Chang-seok.

2149
01:41:35.305 --> 01:41:37.632
You can't compare me to Chang-seok!

2150
01:41:38.438 --> 01:41:41.820
(They learn how to walk
from a super-model)

2151
01:41:42.008 --> 01:41:43.712
(They all deny any normalcy)

2152
01:41:43.875 --> 01:41:45.184
Geez, seriously?

2153
01:41:45.621 --> 01:41:47.508
(Class is over)

2154
01:41:48.413 --> 01:41:50.817
(They try to become the best super-model)

2155
01:41:51.046 --> 01:41:52.444
What are we going to do?

2156
01:41:52.469 --> 01:41:54.817
(All the would-be models try to win)

2157
01:41:55.602 --> 01:41:58.203
(A model on a different class appears)

2158
01:41:58.617 --> 01:42:01.390
- That looks like house on her head.
- How big is your head?

2159
01:42:01.492 --> 01:42:05.751
- I'm today's best model.
- I'd bet $.50 cents on me being the best.

2160
01:42:07.258 --> 01:42:10.770
- I look most like a model.
- Your face needs to get in trouble.

2161
01:42:12.250 --> 01:42:15.520
- What's taking so long?
- I don't like these clothes.

2162
01:42:16.594 --> 01:42:19.141
- What happened?
- How did he change so fast?

2163
01:42:19.227 --> 01:42:21.937
(A competition where cheating is rampant)

2164
01:42:23.531 --> 01:42:25.192
What the heck is going on?

2165
01:42:25.414 --> 01:42:27.751
When you lose a shoe at a fashion show.

2166
01:42:27.906 --> 01:42:30.211
Please leave the runway.

2167
01:42:31.703 --> 01:42:32.703
(Sad)

2168
01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.993
("Ask Us Anything", every
Saturday night at 8:50)

2169
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:38.750
(First seen: Super
Junior's "Black Suit")

2170
01:42:44.438 --> 01:42:46.350
(The black suit that stole my heart)

2171
01:42:46.375 --> 01:42:48.196
Look at Kim Hee-chul!

2172
01:42:48.221 --> 01:42:51.430
(Your rouge headed straight for my heart)

2173
01:42:53.524 --> 01:42:56.774
(Move it up, you make me
fall with just a movement)

2174
01:42:56.945 --> 01:43:00.102
(My heart feels like
it'll burst, Mood)

2175
01:43:00.126 --> 01:43:02.126
