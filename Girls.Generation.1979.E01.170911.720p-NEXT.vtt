You stupid little brats!

- Study a little!

Hey, you!

11
00:01:39.316 --> 00:01:40.917

- Mommy!

12
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.722
Get back here! You brats!

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:09.646
- How do I look? 
- It doesn't look good.

17
00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:11.882
- It doesn't? 
- What?

18
00:02:12.182 --> 00:02:15.819
I hope the guys today will be hot.

19
00:02:15.986 --> 00:02:19.456
I lit candles and prayed last night.

Goodness.

21
00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:23.927
You can't expect anything from group dates.

22
00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:26.196
I have zero expectations.

23
00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:28.899
I'm going only because you said you needed...

24
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.066
another girl.

25
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.668
Sure, sure.

26
00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:32.936
Stop that!

Should we?

37
00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:15.078
I'm Kim Uhn Joo.

- Okay.

my name is Bae Dong Moon, miss.

Yes, that's right.

Don't people say you look like Brooke Shields?

62
00:05:06.523 --> 00:05:07.791
I don't know.

63
00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:11.294
I did hear that I look like Im Ye Jin.

64
00:05:11.294 --> 00:05:13.596
Yes, that's right.

65
00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:16.199
You do look like Im Ye Jin too.

66
00:05:25.842 --> 00:05:26.910
Look,

67
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.045

72

- Oh no. 
- What do we do?

73

They're coming this way.

- Oh no.

Freeze!

82
00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.640
- Get them. 
- Yes, ma'am!

83
00:05:58.141 --> 00:05:59.275
Run!

84
00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:13.490
Stop right there! Stop!

85
00:06:25.902 --> 00:06:27.704
- Hide here. 
- What are you doing?

86
00:06:27.704 --> 00:06:29.105
Get in there. Hurry.

87
00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:30.907
- Get down. 
- What are you doing?

88
00:06:41.718 --> 00:06:42.852
Hello.

No.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.103
You were too!

95
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.105
That was the uniform.

96
00:07:12.282 --> 00:07:13.283
Move.

97
00:07:14.217 --> 00:07:16.019
- Pardon? 
- I said to move.

98
00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:18.021
- I can't. 
- What?

99
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.022
Move!

100
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.356
I can't.

101
00:07:20.723 --> 00:07:22.292
Move.

102
00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:24.394
No. No. I cannot.

103
00:07:24.394 --> 00:07:25.795
- Get up. 
- What are you doing?

104
00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:27.297
- Get up. 
- No.

105
00:07:27.297 --> 00:07:29.532
- Get up. 
- No!

106
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:30.700
No.

107
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.702
- No. No. 
- Ma'am!

108
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.604
They went that way.

109
00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:37.273
- They did? 
- Yes, ma'am.

110
00:07:38.908 --> 00:07:40.276
- Lead the way. 
- Yes, ma'am.

111
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.591
She's gone.

112
00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:56.092
She's gone.

113
00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:57.827
She's gone.

114
00:08:01.197 --> 00:08:02.298
What...

115
00:08:02.832 --> 00:08:04.968
Why did you hit me?

116
00:08:04.968 --> 00:08:06.603
How dare you touch me?

117
00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:10.473
Sorry.

118
00:08:13.776 --> 00:08:14.844
Thanks.

119
00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:17.013
Wait.

120
00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:21.084
The thing is...

121
00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:22.919
So...

122
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:23.953
What?

123
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.224
I want...

124
00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:31.261
- to ask you out... 
- What?

125
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:35.532
Well, if you have time this Sunday...

126
00:08:35.532 --> 00:08:37.133
I don't have time.

127
00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:40.403
Then next Sunday...

128
00:08:40.403 --> 00:08:43.273
Sorry, but I'm busy next Sunday too.

129
00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.774
I'm busy every day.

130
00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:53.316
Attention.

131
00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:54.884
Listen while working.

132
00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.522
I know you guys have been complaining...

133
00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.292
about working late a lot lately.

134
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.895
I think this is because you lack...

135
00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:08.298
ownership in what you do.

136
00:09:08.865 --> 00:09:10.166
Are you tired?

137
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.768
Are you?

138
00:09:11.935 --> 00:09:13.503
I wasn't like that at your age.

139
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.871
Want to hear it?

140
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:16.539
I lost my parents...

141
00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:17.874
when I was a child,

142
00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:20.043
and had to support my family at age 12.

143
00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:22.645
I...

144
00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.181
really did all sorts of...

145
00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:27.183
- things back then. 
- There he goes again.

146
00:09:27.183 --> 00:09:29.252
What are you so tired from?

147
00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:30.520
Are you tired?

148
00:09:31.888 --> 00:09:33.690
That's more like it.

149
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.025
It's my fault for expecting anything.

150
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.695
Jung Hee.

151
00:09:38.695 --> 00:09:40.897
Eng Cho. What are you doing here?

152
00:09:40.897 --> 00:09:42.999
I came with Young Choon.

153
00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.200
You did?

154
00:09:46.736 --> 00:09:49.038
Did a sewing machine break again?

155
00:09:49.772 --> 00:09:50.773
Let's go.

156
00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:55.545
"This factory isn't Lee Ki Nam's factory,"

157
00:09:55.545 --> 00:09:57.313
"but my factory."

158
00:09:57.313 --> 00:10:00.249
"I am a proud member of this community."

159
00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:01.417
What?

160
00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:03.252
- I'm done. 
- You are?

161
00:10:03.252 --> 00:10:04.387
Test it out.

162
00:10:04.387 --> 00:10:05.388
Okay.

163
00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:13.997
- It works. 
- It works so well.

164
00:10:13.997 --> 00:10:15.531
Young Choon's the best.

165
00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:17.100
Did you fix it right?

166
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.769
It broke right away last time.

167
00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:21.137
Young Choon.

168
00:10:21.738 --> 00:10:23.773
Do you make it faulty on purpose?

169
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.409
To make money? No, right?

170
00:10:27.143 --> 00:10:28.511
Young Choon.

171
00:10:28.945 --> 00:10:30.680
- Oh my. 
- Eng Cho.

172
00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:35.551
I said to wait outside. Why did you come in?

173
00:10:36.152 --> 00:10:38.688
Jung Hee said I could come in.

174
00:10:38.688 --> 00:10:39.689
Jung Hee?

175
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:42.792
Are you back?

176
00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:44.293
Where were you?

177
00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:45.895
Your brother came home a while ago.

178
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.163
I'm home.

179
00:10:48.264 --> 00:10:50.433
I'm sure she was studying.

180
00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:53.036
Studying? Do it right!

181
00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:58.174
Gosh. All he ever does is nag.

182
00:11:07.684 --> 00:11:09.285
Thanks. Here.

183
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.387
Thank you.

184
00:11:11.387 --> 00:11:13.523
Young Choon, have some sweet potatoes.

185
00:11:13.523 --> 00:11:14.657
Eat with Eng Cho.

186
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.796
- I'll go now. 
- Okay. Bye.

187
00:11:20.163 --> 00:11:22.031
- Bye. 
- Bye.

188
00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:24.534
Okay. Thanks.

189
00:11:24.534 --> 00:11:26.369
Bye, Eng Cho.

190
00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:27.670
Bye.

191
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:32.542
Why are you so nice to Young Choon?

192
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.311
Hey.

193
00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:38.881
Be careful of Young Choon, okay?

194
00:11:39.048 --> 00:11:41.250
We don't know where he came from.

195
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.920
Don't smile at him...

196
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.388
and be easy.

197
00:11:45.655 --> 00:11:48.658
The boss is right about that.

198
00:11:48.658 --> 00:11:52.695
It's a scary world for women these days.

199
00:11:53.029 --> 00:11:54.063
That's right.

200
00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:58.000
- Especially number three. 
- Me?

201
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.236
Yes, you. Got it?

202
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.772
- Yes, sir. 
- Okay.

203
00:12:03.272 --> 00:12:05.408
It's hot. Back to work.

204
00:12:05.541 --> 00:12:07.143
- Go in. 
- Okay.

205
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:08.277
Goodbye.

206
00:12:09.278 --> 00:12:12.048
Even if I'm lonely or sad

207
00:12:12.048 --> 00:12:15.017
I won't cry

208
00:12:15.284 --> 00:12:19.188
I'll hold it in again and again

209
00:12:19.188 --> 00:12:22.158
Why would I cry?

210
00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.793
I'll laugh and run

211
00:12:23.793 --> 00:12:25.695
On the green field

212
00:12:25.695 --> 00:12:29.298
I'll sing toward the blue sky

213
00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:32.902
My name is My name is

214
00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.139
My name is Candy

215
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.180
Mom!

216
00:12:45.548 --> 00:12:46.649
Mom!

217
00:12:48.384 --> 00:12:49.519
Mom!

218
00:12:56.793 --> 00:12:58.161
What?

219
00:12:58.427 --> 00:13:01.297
Buy me some clothes. I have nothing to wear.

220
00:13:01.297 --> 00:13:03.166
How do you have nothing to wear?

221
00:13:03.166 --> 00:13:06.235
Your room is filled with clothes, you brat.

222
00:13:06.235 --> 00:13:09.005
Look for yourself. It is not!

223
00:13:09.005 --> 00:13:11.541
Mom! Look at this.

224
00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:13.543
It fits so well.

225
00:13:13.643 --> 00:13:15.111
Did you buy new clothes again?

226
00:13:15.778 --> 00:13:17.180
A brand name... Mom!

227
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.148
I said to change, idiot.

228
00:13:19.148 --> 00:13:20.950
What? Jung Hee.

229
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.521
Is only Bong Soo your child?

230
00:13:25.688 --> 00:13:27.390
You always give him brand name clothes,

231
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.258
but give me hand-me-downs.

232
00:13:29.258 --> 00:13:31.994
I told you to show your brother some respect!

233
00:13:32.361 --> 00:13:33.663
He's your big brother!

234
00:13:33.663 --> 00:13:35.131
He is not!

235
00:13:35.298 --> 00:13:38.534
We're twins! Why do you show him favoritism?

236
00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:41.904
Why are the women being so loud?

237
00:13:42.004 --> 00:13:44.073
- Hello. 
- Bong Soo.

238
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.742
- Welcome home, Father. 
- Hey.

239
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.612
Why you...

240
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.647
Jung Hee.

241
00:13:52.648 --> 00:13:54.016
Are you the same as Bong Soo?

242
00:13:55.551 --> 00:13:58.821
You'll end up leaving us for another family.

243
00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:01.791
Your brother is the only son for four generations.

244
00:14:03.025 --> 00:14:04.060
Got it?

245
00:14:05.161 --> 00:14:06.195
Let's eat.

246
00:14:06.796 --> 00:14:08.664
- Father. 
- "Father" what?

247
00:14:08.664 --> 00:14:10.299
You should just agree. What?

248
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.034
How dare you...

249
00:14:12.501 --> 00:14:14.370
How are you teaching her?

250
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.372
What do you do at home all day?

251
00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:19.008
Why don't you go wash up?

252
00:14:19.008 --> 00:14:20.142
You brat.

253
00:14:20.543 --> 00:14:22.545
- What did you buy? 
- Forget it.

254
00:14:23.012 --> 00:14:25.114
Cook up some pork for dinner.

255
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.250
- Okay. 
- Good day, Father.

256
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.818
Ma'am.

257
00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:35.324
Stop it, Jung Hee!

258
00:14:35.324 --> 00:14:36.893
Jung Hee. Stinks to be you.

259
00:14:36.893 --> 00:14:39.028
- Why that... 
- Stop it.

260
00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.665
Jung Hee.

261
00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:44.667
Come on, Jung Hee.

262
00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:50.139
What are you doing? Don't just clap.

263
00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:52.541
Do this. Like this.

264
00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:54.777
- Like this? 
- What?

265
00:14:55.244 --> 00:14:57.413
There's life in your dance.

266
00:14:57.413 --> 00:14:59.916
Okay, like this. Like this.

267
00:15:00.049 --> 00:15:02.418
Number three. Don't just clap.

268
00:15:02.418 --> 00:15:05.021
Dance like this.

269
00:15:05.521 --> 00:15:06.522
Like this?

270
00:15:07.423 --> 00:15:10.059
You're a natural dancer!

271
00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:11.894
Okay, all of you too.

272
00:15:11.894 --> 00:15:13.863
1, 2, 3.

273
00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.935
- Like this? 
- That's it. Good.

274
00:15:19.869 --> 00:15:22.905
Look at her dance. She's got moves.

275
00:15:25.274 --> 00:15:26.309
Okay.

276
00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:42.418
Oh my gosh.

277
00:16:44.153 --> 00:16:45.187
Yes?

278
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:53.529
Is this fun?

279
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.297
Yes.

280
00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.301
Eat this.

281
00:17:22.358 --> 00:17:25.061
I hate...

282
00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:26.962
everyone.

283
00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:33.235
My dictator of a father,

284
00:17:33.235 --> 00:17:37.473
(I hate everyone. My dictator of a father,)

285
00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:39.175
My mom...

286
00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:41.977
who acts like a servant...

287
00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:46.282
to my father and Bong Soo.

288
00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:49.819
The person...

289
00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.788
I hate most...

290
00:17:55.925 --> 00:17:57.560
is Lee Bong Soo.

291
00:18:02.298 --> 00:18:04.467
Why is Lee Jung Hee's 18th year on Earth...

292
00:18:05.134 --> 00:18:08.938
so lonely and boring?

293
00:18:18.747 --> 00:18:20.983
Jung Hee. Eat this.

294
00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:27.823
Where did you get this?

295
00:18:29.058 --> 00:18:30.993
Someone gave it to me earlier,

296
00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:32.962
and I thought of you.

297
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.732
Auntie. Thank you.

298
00:18:36.932 --> 00:18:39.068
You're all I have, you know.

299
00:18:39.468 --> 00:18:40.970
Do you feel better?

300
00:18:41.303 --> 00:18:42.438
Yes.

301
00:18:48.277 --> 00:18:50.513
It melts in my mouth.

302
00:18:51.247 --> 00:18:52.548
My father...

303
00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.484
never once bought me something like this.

304
00:18:55.985 --> 00:18:58.220
What do you mean?

305
00:18:58.354 --> 00:19:01.090
He would never. You know him.

306
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:03.359
When I started high school,

307
00:19:03.526 --> 00:19:05.728
he asked why a girl is going to high school.

308
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.830
Don't you remember?

309
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.198
You're right.

310
00:19:13.269 --> 00:19:14.503
It's yummy.

311
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.541
You are so pretty when you smile.

312
00:19:22.311 --> 00:19:23.779
It's really yummy.

313
00:19:26.849 --> 00:19:28.083
I'm fine.

314
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.599
Jung Hee.

315
00:19:46.302 --> 00:19:48.337
Subtract.

316
00:19:48.337 --> 00:19:50.372
- Add? 
- Subtract.

317
00:19:53.475 --> 00:19:54.610
Hyun Hee.

318
00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:56.679
Shut your trap.

319
00:19:58.214 --> 00:19:59.281
Darn it.

320
00:20:09.992 --> 00:20:13.095
You girls are worse than wild pigs.

321
00:20:14.697 --> 00:20:17.032
You can't even solve that?

322
00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:20.970
Uhn Joo, sit down.

323
00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:24.273
Ki Ryuh.

324
00:20:26.242 --> 00:20:27.610
Everyone else, line up.

325
00:20:28.544 --> 00:20:30.579
- But... 
- Line up!

326
00:20:36.685 --> 00:20:39.288
Listen up, okay? The DMZ...

327
00:20:39.722 --> 00:20:42.191
split the nation for 20 years.

328
00:20:43.592 --> 00:20:45.794
The communists up north are always...

329
00:20:45.794 --> 00:20:48.764
looking for ways to attack our country.

330
00:20:49.131 --> 00:20:51.700
You live comfortably and just study,

331
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.371
stuffing your faces with food they give you,

332
00:20:55.771 --> 00:20:58.807
and you can't solve a simple math problem?

333
00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:02.778
You're not even human.

334
00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:04.880
You're pigs.

335
00:21:06.282 --> 00:21:07.383
Get ready.

336
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.685
Okay.

337
00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:12.521
Are you ready?

338
00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:14.790
Yes.

339
00:21:20.629 --> 00:21:22.531
- Shoot. 
- Shoot.

340
00:21:22.765 --> 00:21:24.199
Bang! Bang!

341
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.601
That hurts.

342
00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:28.937
- Shoot. 
- Shoot.

343
00:21:28.937 --> 00:21:30.539
Bang! Bang!

344
00:21:33.042 --> 00:21:35.010
The communists shot them.

345
00:21:35.077 --> 00:21:37.279
- Seriously. 
- Take your seats.

346
00:21:45.287 --> 00:21:47.423
Hey. Page 55.

347
00:21:54.863 --> 00:21:58.033
It's all red. Darn it.

348
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.570
Oh Man Sang. I'll get him one day.

349
00:22:04.673 --> 00:22:07.676
Hey. Ae Sook is wearing something with a strap.

350
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.046
Where did she get that?

351
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.314
They don't sell it here.

352
00:22:12.548 --> 00:22:13.849
It's a secret.

353
00:22:13.849 --> 00:22:15.184
It's pretty.

354
00:22:19.722 --> 00:22:22.925
That's not pretty. That's for delinquents.

355
00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.129
Attention!

356
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.498
At ease!

357
00:22:30.733 --> 00:22:31.734
Attention!

358
00:22:32.101 --> 00:22:34.970
We will now begin your training.

359
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.872
About face!

360
00:22:36.872 --> 00:22:38.273
1, 2!

361
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:39.675
I'm sorry!

362
00:22:43.579 --> 00:22:44.580
What's your name?

363
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.014
Culture Night?

364
00:22:46.014 --> 00:22:48.150
Ki Wook, my partner from yesterday,

365
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.985
invited all of you to come.

366
00:22:49.985 --> 00:22:52.755
All the boys from yesterday will be there.

367
00:22:53.756 --> 00:22:55.357
Forward march.

368
00:22:55.758 --> 00:22:59.194
1, 2, 3, 4.

369
00:22:59.428 --> 00:23:00.696
Left.

370
00:23:00.696 --> 00:23:01.797
Forget it.

371
00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:04.266
I don't want to see that fish head.

372
00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:07.870
The fish head isn't the problem.

373
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.838
- What? 
- If Eun Ja goes,

374
00:23:09.838 --> 00:23:12.541
you can see Son Jin.

375
00:23:12.541 --> 00:23:13.675
Son Jin?

376
00:23:13.675 --> 00:23:15.878
Left.

377
00:23:15.878 --> 00:23:17.780
Who's Son Jin? A guy?

378
00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.782
Are you kidding? You don't know Son Jin?

379
00:23:19.782 --> 00:23:21.483
Are you a spy or something?

380
00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:23.552
He's the hottie of Gaeryong High.

381
00:23:23.552 --> 00:23:24.820
The student body president.

382
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.555
Is he that cute?

383
00:23:26.555 --> 00:23:28.490
That goes without saying.

384
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.226
Daegu is flooded with girls...

385
00:23:31.226 --> 00:23:33.462
obsessed with him.

386
00:23:33.462 --> 00:23:36.265
That's right. I'm so excited.

387
00:23:46.375 --> 00:23:48.811
Band together, and you will live.

388
00:23:49.278 --> 00:23:51.847
Scatter, and you will die!

389
00:23:53.382 --> 00:23:56.251
Because of the students who split from the pack,

390
00:23:57.252 --> 00:23:59.755
the entire class will be punished.

391
00:24:00.923 --> 00:24:04.259
Make sure this doesn't happen again.

392
00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:05.360
What?

393
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.196
- So all of you... 
- Hey.

394
00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:10.265
- This is your fault. 
- must be vigilant!

395
00:24:10.265 --> 00:24:11.600
Understand?

396
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.768
My arms will get thick.

397
00:24:12.768 --> 00:24:14.369
Understand?

398
00:24:16.738 --> 00:24:17.773
Over there.

399
00:24:18.674 --> 00:24:21.677
Jung Hee. Ae Sook. Come forward.

400
00:24:21.844 --> 00:24:23.479
Ma'am!

401
00:24:24.012 --> 00:24:25.981
I didn't do anything.

402
00:24:25.981 --> 00:24:28.250
Come forward. Now!

403
00:24:36.859 --> 00:24:41.029
You don't know how to repent.

404
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.031
Get down.

405
00:24:43.499 --> 00:24:44.600
- Ma'am! 
- Ma'am!

406
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.834
Get down.

407
00:24:47.035 --> 00:24:48.103
Get down!

408
00:24:49.872 --> 00:24:51.540
Forward march.

409
00:24:52.007 --> 00:24:55.544
1, 2, 3, 4.

410
00:24:55.811 --> 00:24:59.281
1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2.

411
00:24:59.448 --> 00:25:02.284
1, 2, 3, 4.

412
00:25:02.284 --> 00:25:06.522
Jung Hee. I will never forget this.

413
00:25:06.522 --> 00:25:08.824
Quiet. I'm tired.

414
00:25:10.993 --> 00:25:13.629
(Culture Night)

415
00:25:13.629 --> 00:25:16.498
If things go well, we may have a spontaneous date.

416
00:25:16.498 --> 00:25:17.733
What do you mean?

417
00:25:18.767 --> 00:25:21.236
You don't even know that?

418
00:25:21.236 --> 00:25:23.338
A group date that happens spontaneously.

419
00:25:23.338 --> 00:25:26.041
Jung Hee.

420
00:25:31.813 --> 00:25:34.082
Hello.

421
00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:36.818
Did you get home safely?

422
00:25:36.818 --> 00:25:39.521
That was ages ago. Why are you asking now?

423
00:25:40.989 --> 00:25:43.325
- Then do you... 
- Okay then.

424
00:25:45.294 --> 00:25:46.962
Okay then.

425
00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:57.239
There are so many guys.

426
00:25:58.073 --> 00:25:59.508
I'm so happy.

427
00:26:02.277 --> 00:26:04.212
Do you feel sick?

428
00:26:04.746 --> 00:26:07.182
She's wearing a girdle.

429
00:26:07.182 --> 00:26:08.584
- A girdle? 
- A girdle?

430
00:26:09.284 --> 00:26:10.786
You mean, a corset?

431
00:26:10.786 --> 00:26:12.788
Why? To look thin?

432
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:16.058
I can't do this.

433
00:26:16.792 --> 00:26:18.594
I need to take this off.

434
00:26:19.695 --> 00:26:20.996
I'll go with you.

435
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:27.302
I'm so gassy. My stomach's going crazy.

436
00:26:29.938 --> 00:26:33.108
Come on. What the...

437
00:26:34.543 --> 00:26:36.044
She's got guts,

438
00:26:36.044 --> 00:26:39.548
smoking in the church bathroom like that.

439
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.989
Look who this is.

440
00:26:47.489 --> 00:26:50.492
Enemies always meet, even without trying.

441
00:26:50.492 --> 00:26:51.860
I'm glad to see you here.

442
00:26:52.594 --> 00:26:54.796
What do you mean, enemies?

443
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.532
- Kiddos. 
- Get out.

444
00:26:58.834 --> 00:26:59.935
Get out!

445
00:26:59.935 --> 00:27:01.069
Go upstairs.

446
00:27:01.069 --> 00:27:02.237
Scram!

447
00:27:02.304 --> 00:27:04.039
- What are you doing? 
- Jung Hee.

448
00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:06.108
This pretty face of mine...

449
00:27:06.108 --> 00:27:08.510
got sunburned because I was being punished...

450
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:09.811
because of you.

451
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:11.380
Why was that my fault?

452
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.849
You hit me first.

453
00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:15.250
What?

454
00:27:15.784 --> 00:27:17.319
Have you lost your mind?

455
00:27:17.519 --> 00:27:18.520
Hey.

456
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.490
What do you take the Acacia Gang for?

457
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.325
Let's just go.

458
00:27:23.325 --> 00:27:25.093
Are you out of your mind?

459
00:27:25.093 --> 00:27:26.995
Go inside!

460
00:27:26.995 --> 00:27:28.797
Let me out!

461
00:27:28.797 --> 00:27:31.333
- Shut it! 
- What are you doing?

462
00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:32.534
What else?

463
00:27:32.534 --> 00:27:34.870
The Acacia girls are going to...

464
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.372
teach you a lesson. Got it?

465
00:27:42.477 --> 00:27:45.080
What was that? Am I a fly?

466
00:27:45.547 --> 00:27:47.516
Ae Sook, you're bleeding.

467
00:27:47.516 --> 00:27:48.517
What?

468
00:27:49.017 --> 00:27:50.185
Oh no.

469
00:27:50.185 --> 00:27:51.186
Let me see.

470
00:27:51.987 --> 00:27:53.822
Why you... Get her.

471
00:27:53.822 --> 00:27:55.090
Jung Hee!

472
00:27:55.724 --> 00:27:57.359
You're dead.

473
00:27:59.027 --> 00:28:01.129
- Jung Hee! 
- Stop it!

474
00:28:01.129 --> 00:28:02.931
Stop!

475
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:05.934
- Stop! 
- Get her!

476
00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:09.504
- Jung Hee! 
- Stop running!

477
00:28:09.504 --> 00:28:11.373
- Get back here. 
- Jung Hee!

478
00:28:11.373 --> 00:28:13.041
Get over here!

479
00:28:15.277 --> 00:28:18.080
Stop right there!

480
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:22.050
Open up.

481
00:28:22.084 --> 00:28:23.518
Come out while I'm being nice.

482
00:28:23.518 --> 00:28:26.088
- Jung Hee! 
- Open up!

483
00:28:26.088 --> 00:28:27.389
Hey. Push.

484
00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:29.491
Come on!

485
00:28:30.859 --> 00:28:32.360
It won't budge.

486
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.563
Get out here!

487
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.532
Why is she so strong?

488
00:28:38.033 --> 00:28:40.869
- Jung Hee! 
- Open the door.

489
00:28:40.869 --> 00:28:43.505
- Jung Hee! 
- Open up!

490
00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:45.140
Mommy.

491
00:28:49.177 --> 00:28:50.579
Jung Hee!

492
00:28:50.579 --> 00:28:52.781
Jung Hee! Open up.

493
00:28:52.781 --> 00:28:54.216
Open the door!

494
00:29:00.188 --> 00:29:01.323
Son Jin?

495
00:29:02.057 --> 00:29:03.291
Son Jin?

496
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.194
Son Jin?

497
00:29:06.194 --> 00:29:09.030
Daegu is flooded with girls...

498
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.800
obsessed with him.

499
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.435
That Son Jin?

500
00:29:13.435 --> 00:29:14.536
What's going on?

501
00:29:15.804 --> 00:29:18.673
Hello. By any chance,

502
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.042
- did a girl... 
- No.

503
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:23.512
This room is restricted.

504
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.252
I'm sorry.

505
00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:35.524
Let's go.

506
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.304
Are they gone?

507
00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.548
They're gone.

508
00:30:03.718 --> 00:30:05.954
You're brave, taking on three alone.

509
00:30:10.192 --> 00:30:12.594
Go out through that door. You'll be safe.

510
00:30:15.463 --> 00:30:17.199
Thank you.

511
00:30:22.537 --> 00:30:24.005
That was the moment.

512
00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.210
The first time I met Son Jin...

513
00:30:28.677 --> 00:30:30.212
and turned around...

514
00:30:40.222 --> 00:30:43.525
The world before me had suddenly changed.

515
00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:47.929
It was no longer boring and lonely.

516
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.031
It was a brand new world.

517
00:30:51.233 --> 00:30:52.701
A world...

518
00:30:53.235 --> 00:30:56.538
where a boy entered into my heart.

519
00:31:34.743 --> 00:31:35.777
I...

520
00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:38.079
was in love.

521
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:55.931
I...

522
00:31:56.431 --> 00:31:57.899
was in love.

523
00:32:23.959 --> 00:32:27.228
But I didn't realize that love meant...

524
00:32:29.631 --> 00:32:32.133
pain will soon ensue.

525
00:32:44.079 --> 00:32:47.782
And that I'd be hugging a rock...

526
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:50.785
wrapped in thorns in my heart.

527
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.722
I had no idea back then.

528
00:32:54.522 --> 00:32:56.424
1 over 4.

529
00:32:56.858 --> 00:32:59.961
And 1 over 4...

530
00:33:00.328 --> 00:33:02.964
minus 1 over 4.

531
00:33:03.798 --> 00:33:05.700
Okay. Got it?

532
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:07.535
Okay.

533
00:33:20.849 --> 00:33:22.217
Son Jin.

534
00:33:34.829 --> 00:33:36.598
Son Jin.

535
00:33:38.533 --> 00:33:42.203
1, 2, 3, 4.

536
00:33:42.203 --> 00:33:43.838
About face.

537
00:33:48.543 --> 00:33:49.544
Jung Hee.

538
00:33:50.979 --> 00:33:52.080
Lee Jung Hee!

539
00:34:19.574 --> 00:34:21.009
Son Jin.

540
00:34:23.178 --> 00:34:25.613
Oh, egg rolls! That looks good.

541
00:34:26.614 --> 00:34:28.216
Give me some.

542
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:29.984
Thanks.

543
00:34:30.251 --> 00:34:31.619
Yes.

544
00:34:32.253 --> 00:34:33.555
Okay.

545
00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:35.190
This one.

546
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:38.026
"Before I called her name,"

547
00:34:38.193 --> 00:34:42.130
"she was nothing more than a gesture."

548
00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.599
"The Flower"...

549
00:34:44.999 --> 00:34:48.570
by Kim Chun Su. Here is the last song.

550
00:34:49.571 --> 00:34:52.540
Barbara Streisand's...

551
00:34:52.841 --> 00:34:55.276
"The Way We Were".

552
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.418
Son Jin.

553
00:35:04.252 --> 00:35:06.754
What are you doing right now?

554
00:35:07.922 --> 00:35:10.458
Whether I look at a flower or the sky,

555
00:35:10.825 --> 00:35:12.694
all I think about is you.

556
00:35:13.228 --> 00:35:15.130
You have no idea, do you?

557
00:35:17.999 --> 00:35:19.300
I miss you.

558
00:35:20.268 --> 00:35:21.569
I want to see you.

559
00:35:24.072 --> 00:35:25.673
Jung Hee!

560
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:28.943
We have big news.

561
00:35:29.677 --> 00:35:31.179
I'm not interested.

562
00:35:31.179 --> 00:35:32.981
It's about Son Jin.

563
00:35:34.549 --> 00:35:37.919
I heard he goes to the Taehyang-dong library.

564
00:35:37.919 --> 00:35:39.053
Taehyang-dong?

565
00:35:39.687 --> 00:35:41.823
Why does he go so far to study?

566
00:35:41.823 --> 00:35:45.093
Girls bother him too much at libraries nearby.

567
00:35:45.093 --> 00:35:47.962
- Are you sure? 
- We're sure.

568
00:35:47.962 --> 00:35:50.798
It's top secret intel that my honey told me.

569
00:35:59.674 --> 00:36:02.443
What? You already have an alarm clock.

570
00:36:03.077 --> 00:36:05.947
One isn't enough, that's why.

571
00:36:09.551 --> 00:36:10.718
Are you deaf?

572
00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.557
Mom. I think Jung Hee went deaf.

573
00:37:02.303 --> 00:37:05.006
Oh no! Why didn't it go off?

574
00:37:07.442 --> 00:37:09.344
You're up.

575
00:37:09.477 --> 00:37:11.980
The alarms went off, but you wouldn't wake up.

576
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.849
You should've woken me!

577
00:37:18.052 --> 00:37:20.922
Don't just go. Eat something first.

578
00:37:21.055 --> 00:37:23.024
No. I have no time.

579
00:37:23.024 --> 00:37:25.360
I mixed it with an egg and sesame oil.

580
00:37:26.928 --> 00:37:28.296
Okay. Bye.

581
00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:30.198
Jung Hee.

582
00:37:30.965 --> 00:37:33.167
She didn't even eat.

583
00:37:34.068 --> 00:37:35.270
Out of my way!

584
00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:44.979
They say co-ed rooms fill up quickly.

585
00:37:56.457 --> 00:38:01.195
(Spies don't wear signs. We should all look.)

586
00:38:06.034 --> 00:38:07.168
Co-ed?

587
00:38:09.904 --> 00:38:11.673
That's strange. Co-ed?

588
00:38:18.212 --> 00:38:21.149
I want a white one. I want the co-ed room.

589
00:38:21.149 --> 00:38:22.250
It's full.

590
00:38:22.884 --> 00:38:24.052
No.

591
00:38:29.824 --> 00:38:31.959
Dong Moon? Dong Moon!

592
00:38:32.093 --> 00:38:33.361
Dong Moon!

593
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:36.698
Jung Hee.

594
00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:41.369
Come on. Trade with me.

595
00:38:43.004 --> 00:38:45.907
That's for the girl's room.

596
00:38:46.074 --> 00:38:47.342
Then...

597
00:38:47.809 --> 00:38:51.212
can't you give me that and get a new one?

598
00:38:51.779 --> 00:38:55.249
The boys' room will be filled by now.

599
00:38:57.385 --> 00:38:58.920
If I give this to you,

600
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.888
I have to wait until someone leaves.

601
00:39:01.255 --> 00:39:03.524
Dong Moon. Please?

602
00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:06.361
Come on, Dong Moon.

603
00:39:07.328 --> 00:39:08.429
Please?

604
00:39:17.305 --> 00:39:19.574
- Thanks. 
- Wait.

605
00:39:19.907 --> 00:39:21.342
Jung Hee...

606
00:39:30.418 --> 00:39:32.754
(Co-ed Room)

607
00:40:20.568 --> 00:40:22.069
Son Jin.

608
00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:24.672
Jin.

609
00:40:39.887 --> 00:40:42.190
Hi, Jin.

610
00:40:43.157 --> 00:40:45.293
Do you remember me?

611
00:40:48.029 --> 00:40:49.030
No.

612
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.069
The Culture Night...

613
00:40:55.803 --> 00:40:58.239
No. That's not right.

614
00:41:01.943 --> 00:41:05.446
Anyway, this is a chance of a lifetime.

615
00:41:07.148 --> 00:41:08.616
Don't shy away from it.

616
00:41:26.868 --> 00:41:28.269
Hello.

617
00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:32.840
Last time, at Culture Night...

618
00:41:34.842 --> 00:41:35.943
Why are you...

619
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.048
Why are you here?

620
00:41:43.918 --> 00:41:46.254
Jin, who was sitting here, just left.

621
00:41:46.254 --> 00:41:47.321
What?

622
00:41:52.293 --> 00:41:54.295
Jung Hee.

623
00:42:13.648 --> 00:42:16.484
- Jung Hee. 
- You'll get hurt! Move!

624
00:42:18.719 --> 00:42:20.821
Jung Hee. Where are you going?

625
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.405
Ouch.

626
00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:56.417
Are you okay?

627
00:44:01.055 --> 00:44:02.156
Are you hurt?

628
00:44:02.823 --> 00:44:03.858
Let me see.

629
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.829
Oh no. Can you stand?

630
00:44:34.188 --> 00:44:35.756
You're all cut up.

631
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.068
Are you okay?

632
00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:51.839
Excuse me.

633
00:44:52.339 --> 00:44:53.607
Are you okay?

634
00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:57.044
Are you badly hurt?

635
00:44:57.344 --> 00:44:58.546
That very moment,

636
00:44:58.679 --> 00:45:02.049
something made me feel very nervous.

637
00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:03.651
What is this?

638
00:45:03.651 --> 00:45:05.219
Are you okay?

639
00:45:06.887 --> 00:45:08.989
Are you okay?

640
00:45:09.924 --> 00:45:11.292
You're hurt badly.

641
00:45:11.292 --> 00:45:12.693
Let's go to the doctor.

642
00:45:13.027 --> 00:45:15.463
No, I'm fine.

643
00:45:15.529 --> 00:45:16.630
But you're bleeding.

644
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:19.133
I'm fine. I'll just go to the pharmacy.

645
00:45:19.133 --> 00:45:22.069
Sorry, but we were in the middle of moving...

646
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:24.672
Hae Joo. You should help her.

647
00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:26.173
Okay, Dad.

648
00:45:26.173 --> 00:45:27.842
Thanks.

649
00:45:30.277 --> 00:45:31.679
Can you walk?

650
00:45:34.048 --> 00:45:35.049
Get on.

651
00:45:38.119 --> 00:45:39.420
I said to get on.

652
00:45:47.228 --> 00:45:49.363
I'm dreaming.

653
00:45:49.363 --> 00:45:50.898
I'm still dreaming.

654
00:45:51.132 --> 00:45:53.901
If it's a dream, please don't wake up.

655
00:45:54.502 --> 00:45:56.070
Does it hurt that badly?

656
00:46:02.343 --> 00:46:05.279
Is this really happening?

657
00:46:07.948 --> 00:46:10.651
I can die happy now.

658
00:46:11.886 --> 00:46:14.421
She must be in a lot of pain. Oh no.

659
00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:20.427
Look. There's a pharmacy.

660
00:46:20.961 --> 00:46:21.962
Okay.

661
00:46:22.196 --> 00:46:23.397
It's open.

662
00:46:25.232 --> 00:46:27.735
(Kim's Pharmacy)

663
00:46:29.904 --> 00:46:33.841
That stupid. Why is it open on a Sunday?

664
00:46:38.112 --> 00:46:39.446
Go somewhere else.

665
00:46:39.947 --> 00:46:41.482
We're not open for business today.

666
00:46:43.551 --> 00:46:44.919
I'm sorry,

667
00:46:44.919 --> 00:46:46.654
but someone fell.

668
00:46:47.087 --> 00:46:48.322
Darn it.

669
00:47:01.135 --> 00:47:02.169
You look fine.

670
00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:04.805
No, not me.

671
00:47:06.407 --> 00:47:09.076
Jung Hee. What's wrong?

672
00:47:09.777 --> 00:47:11.612
Were you hurt?

673
00:47:11.846 --> 00:47:13.547
She fell off her bike.

674
00:47:13.848 --> 00:47:15.282
We need an antiseptic...

675
00:47:15.282 --> 00:47:16.483
Sir!

676
00:47:16.817 --> 00:47:19.053
Jung Hee's hurt. Please come out.

677
00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.089
You ride your bike so well.

678
00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:24.525
Where was your head?

679
00:47:24.525 --> 00:47:26.093
We need to stop the bleeding.

680
00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:29.029
- Please get us... 
- Ask the pharmacist.

681
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:30.898
Sir!

682
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:38.305
I'm sorry. It must hurt.

683
00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:40.441
Still, you have to get the dirt out.

684
00:47:41.208 --> 00:47:42.209
Let me see.

685
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.279
You have so much dirt on the wound.

686
00:47:56.924 --> 00:47:59.093
Jung Hee. Let me see.

687
00:48:01.729 --> 00:48:03.230
Let me get you an antiseptic.

688
00:48:03.998 --> 00:48:06.901
Okay. I'll go work then.

689
00:48:06.901 --> 00:48:08.369
Go ahead.

690
00:48:08.769 --> 00:48:11.138
You're going to be rich, Young Choon.

691
00:48:11.338 --> 00:48:12.740
You work so hard.

692
00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:13.774
Not at all.

693
00:48:14.041 --> 00:48:15.609
Let me see.

694
00:48:17.077 --> 00:48:18.479
That hurts.

695
00:48:18.612 --> 00:48:19.980
You crybaby.

696
00:48:26.654 --> 00:48:34.695
(Kim's Pharmacy)

697
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.135
Are you really okay?

698
00:48:41.635 --> 00:48:44.138
Yes, I'm fine now.

699
00:48:44.672 --> 00:48:46.607
I'll go then.

700
00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:53.981
Call me here if something else hurts...

701
00:48:53.981 --> 00:48:55.282
or anything.

702
00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:57.418
Okay?

703
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.921
I will.

704
00:49:20.107 --> 00:49:21.108
I...

705
00:49:21.909 --> 00:49:22.910
Yes?

706
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:25.446
I'm okay now.

707
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.281
I can go alone.

708
00:49:28.983 --> 00:49:31.518
No, I'll walk you home.

709
00:49:41.962 --> 00:49:43.030
But...

710
00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:45.399
where were you rushing to?

711
00:49:45.799 --> 00:49:48.502
What? Well...

712
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:50.938
Why do you go so far to study?

713
00:49:50.938 --> 00:49:51.939
What?

714
00:49:54.808 --> 00:49:55.943
You almost fell again.

715
00:49:55.943 --> 00:49:57.778
Well... I thought...

716
00:49:57.778 --> 00:50:00.481
a change of scenery...

717
00:50:00.614 --> 00:50:03.917
would help me study better.

718
00:50:04.818 --> 00:50:05.819
So?

719
00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.554
Did it?

720
00:50:07.821 --> 00:50:09.690
- What? 
- I guess not.

721
00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:11.358
That's why you left so early.

722
00:50:12.693 --> 00:50:14.461
That's not why.

723
00:50:15.029 --> 00:50:17.131
I had an errand to run.

724
00:50:17.131 --> 00:50:19.133
What's going on here?

725
00:50:19.133 --> 00:50:20.734
You left early in the morning to study,

726
00:50:20.734 --> 00:50:22.669
and you're flirting with a guy on the street?

727
00:50:22.669 --> 00:50:24.004
Who's this punk?

728
00:50:26.306 --> 00:50:27.341
Sir.

729
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.979
Hello. Oh no.

730
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.115
I attend Gaeryong High. I'm in... Which class?

731
00:50:35.115 --> 00:50:36.550
- 11-5. 
- 11-5.

732
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:38.385
- What's my number? 
- 28.

733
00:50:38.385 --> 00:50:40.788
Number 28, Lee Bong Soo.

734
00:50:41.021 --> 00:50:42.489
- Lee Bong Soo? 
- Yes.

735
00:50:43.023 --> 00:50:44.925
He's my brother. Twin brother.

736
00:50:44.925 --> 00:50:46.026
I see.

737
00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:48.028
You're Bong Soo.

738
00:50:48.862 --> 00:50:50.631
- What's your name? 
- I'm...

739
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:53.801
She's Jung Hee. Lee Jung Hee. My sister.

740
00:50:54.234 --> 00:50:56.070
- Jung Hee. 
- Yes.

741
00:50:56.637 --> 00:50:58.772
- Bong Soo. 
- Yes, sir.

742
00:50:58.772 --> 00:51:01.708
I left your sister's bike at the bike shop.

743
00:51:03.077 --> 00:51:04.078
What?

744
00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:06.113
Your sister's hurt,

745
00:51:06.713 --> 00:51:07.748
so you go pick it up.

746
00:51:07.748 --> 00:51:08.749
What?

747
00:51:08.849 --> 00:51:10.984
Okay.

748
00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:14.188
- Jung Hee. 
- Yes?

749
00:51:14.188 --> 00:51:15.189
See you again.

750
00:51:20.294 --> 00:51:22.129
Have a nice day, sir!

751
00:51:22.629 --> 00:51:23.730
Wait.

752
00:51:27.968 --> 00:51:29.236
Thank you.

753
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:32.072
Don't chase after me so hard next time.

754
00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:33.607
You'll get hurt.

755
00:51:34.108 --> 00:51:35.709
- What? 
- Get better soon.

756
00:51:47.321 --> 00:51:49.823
What's going on? Why was he with you?

757
00:51:51.058 --> 00:51:52.459
Are you chasing after him?

758
00:51:52.593 --> 00:51:54.595
You fell while chasing him, didn't you?

759
00:51:54.962 --> 00:51:56.330
Seriously!

760
00:51:59.967 --> 00:52:01.001
What the...

761
00:52:01.068 --> 00:52:03.137
Did you yell at your big brother?

762
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:05.005
I'm telling Dad.

763
00:52:05.005 --> 00:52:06.039
Get over here!

764
00:52:07.074 --> 00:52:08.108
Hey!

765
00:52:10.611 --> 00:52:12.112
I'm right.

766
00:52:12.613 --> 00:52:14.848
You're chasing Jin too, aren't you?

767
00:52:14.848 --> 00:52:17.551
Goodness. Jung Hee. What is your problem?

768
00:52:17.551 --> 00:52:19.419
Try using that energy to study.

769
00:52:19.419 --> 00:52:21.088
Shut it.

770
00:52:21.188 --> 00:52:24.324
I guess you're all better. You were dying earlier.

771
00:52:24.324 --> 00:52:27.127
Seriously! Just go, and get my bike.

772
00:52:27.528 --> 00:52:29.930
No. You get it yourself.

773
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:33.500
Why you... Jin told you to get it for me!

774
00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:34.668
You said you would!

775
00:52:34.668 --> 00:52:36.670
I don't care who said what.

776
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:38.839
Tell him to stuff it.

777
00:52:41.041 --> 00:52:43.410
What's that? Someone's moving in.

778
00:52:43.544 --> 00:52:45.045
- Where? 
- There.

779
00:52:48.448 --> 00:52:50.651
Look at Young Choon.

780
00:52:51.018 --> 00:52:52.486
He's everywhere.

781
00:52:52.519 --> 00:52:55.322
He works so hard for such a pretty boy.

782
00:52:59.092 --> 00:53:00.627
Where should I put this?

783
00:53:00.727 --> 00:53:02.362
Just leave it by the door.

784
00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.523
Is that an angel?

785
00:53:31.358 --> 00:53:32.759
She must be human, right?

786
00:53:32.759 --> 00:53:34.861
Hey. I'm leaving.

787
00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:37.297
Why are you going that way?

788
00:53:38.131 --> 00:53:39.132
Jung Hee!

789
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.901
Jung Hee!

790
00:53:41.768 --> 00:53:43.637
Wow. She's so pretty.

791
00:53:44.037 --> 00:53:45.072
Jung Hee!

792
00:53:45.906 --> 00:53:47.040
Jung Hee!

793
00:53:54.548 --> 00:53:55.782
I can do it.

794
00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:57.651
I'll take it.

795
00:53:59.886 --> 00:54:01.188
Thank you.

796
00:54:08.795 --> 00:54:10.998
Jung Hee!

797
00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:12.799
Jung Hee!

798
00:54:14.401 --> 00:54:16.169
- You're coming home now? 
- You...

799
00:54:16.737 --> 00:54:18.071
know where I live?

800
00:54:18.438 --> 00:54:20.907
No. You rushed out so suddenly,

801
00:54:21.074 --> 00:54:22.709
I was worried and ran after you.

802
00:54:30.417 --> 00:54:32.819
What happened... What happened there?

803
00:54:33.153 --> 00:54:34.688
None of your business. Just go.

804
00:54:38.592 --> 00:54:39.693
But hey.

805
00:54:40.794 --> 00:54:43.497
What were you doing at Taehyang Library?

806
00:54:45.999 --> 00:54:47.567
Well, the thing is...

807
00:54:48.302 --> 00:54:50.671
I guess Gaeryong High kids go there.

808
00:54:50.904 --> 00:54:54.841
True. Son Jin, the student body president, goes too.

809
00:54:55.342 --> 00:54:56.443
Right?

810
00:54:56.977 --> 00:54:58.779
Yes, that's right.

811
00:54:59.713 --> 00:55:02.649
What about you? Why did you go so far?

812
00:55:04.651 --> 00:55:06.486
- Dong Moon. 
- Yes?

813
00:55:07.521 --> 00:55:09.589
- You... 
- Yes?

814
00:55:09.656 --> 00:55:11.191
don't need to know.

815
00:55:24.171 --> 00:55:25.405
That must hurt.

816
00:55:36.383 --> 00:55:38.752
Jung Hee. Why are you home so early?

817
00:55:41.188 --> 00:55:42.389
Oh my gosh.

818
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:46.360
Oh my gosh. Are you hurt? How?

819
00:55:46.827 --> 00:55:48.028
It's nothing.

820
00:55:52.733 --> 00:55:53.867
Oh my gosh.

821
00:56:02.709 --> 00:56:04.845
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

822
00:56:05.045 --> 00:56:06.079
Let me see.

823
00:56:06.279 --> 00:56:09.049
Oh no. Can you stand?

824
00:56:09.249 --> 00:56:10.350
Jung Hee.

825
00:56:12.219 --> 00:56:13.320
See you again.

826
00:56:20.527 --> 00:56:21.728
Yes.

827
00:56:39.045 --> 00:56:41.948
Let me see. You have so much dirt on the wound.

828
00:56:47.521 --> 00:56:48.755
That's strange.

829
00:56:49.189 --> 00:56:51.324
I was so happy earlier.

830
00:56:51.691 --> 00:56:53.693
Why do I feel so down now?

831
00:57:02.169 --> 00:57:03.837
It's because I miss him.

832
00:57:04.137 --> 00:57:07.340
The more I think of him, the more I miss him.

833
00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:10.410
That's why I keep feeling down.

834
00:57:14.881 --> 00:57:17.918
How can I wait until Sunday?

835
00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.288
Keep it down!

836
00:57:21.822 --> 00:57:23.290
Go to sleep!

837
00:57:28.028 --> 00:57:29.629
Son Jin did that?

838
00:57:34.468 --> 00:57:37.804
Do you mean it? You were on Son Jin's back?

839
00:57:38.004 --> 00:57:39.172
Really?

840
00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.775
You rubbed your chest...

841
00:57:41.942 --> 00:57:44.578
onto Jin's back like this?

842
00:57:44.578 --> 00:57:46.947
Come on. I didn't do that.

843
00:57:46.947 --> 00:57:48.114
What do you mean?

844
00:57:48.648 --> 00:57:51.918
How could you be on his back without...

845
00:57:51.985 --> 00:57:53.420
rubbing them on it?

846
00:57:54.488 --> 00:57:56.423
- You're terrible! 
- Come on!

847
00:57:56.423 --> 00:57:57.757
Shut it!

848
00:57:58.358 --> 00:57:59.759
Keep it down!

849
00:58:02.095 --> 00:58:04.898
I'll take down all of your names.

850
00:58:08.502 --> 00:58:09.569
Be quiet.

851
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:11.838
Study.

852
00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:15.942
- Hush. 
- You brat.

853
00:58:19.212 --> 00:58:21.481
(Student Transcript)

854
00:58:41.801 --> 00:58:44.838
(It's game over.)

855
00:58:44.838 --> 00:58:47.607
It's game over.

856
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:51.444
That's right. Jung Hee,

857
00:58:51.444 --> 00:58:53.280
you're now the girlfriend...

858
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.248
of Daegu's hottie, Son Jin.

859
00:59:02.188 --> 00:59:04.925
It's not like that.

860
00:59:06.059 --> 00:59:07.327
It is too.

861
00:59:08.361 --> 00:59:10.096
There's a girl named Choi Duk Boon...

862
00:59:10.397 --> 00:59:12.132
from Dongsung Girls' School,

863
00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:14.467
who's infamous for following Jin around.

864
00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:18.138
She fell in front of his school one day,

865
00:59:18.338 --> 00:59:20.340
and was a total mess.

866
00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:23.209
Do you know what he did?

867
00:59:23.677 --> 00:59:24.778
What did he do?

868
00:59:31.484 --> 00:59:34.688
- Be careful. 
- And then he took off.

869
00:59:34.688 --> 00:59:37.591
She was bleeding in the middle of the street.

870
00:59:37.857 --> 00:59:41.027
No way. I'm sure she was not bleeding that much.

871
00:59:41.828 --> 00:59:43.096
Regardless.

872
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:45.365
That's how he is.

873
00:59:45.732 --> 00:59:48.635
That's right. He's cold and arrogant.

874
01:00:11.091 --> 01:00:12.292
That's right.

875
01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:16.696
He's famous for not giving girls a second look.

876
01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:17.998
But...

877
01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:21.001
he carried you on his back.

878
01:00:22.068 --> 01:00:23.403
He chose you.

879
01:00:26.406 --> 01:00:27.707
What do you mean?

880
01:00:32.779 --> 01:00:34.047
This.

881
01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:36.282
This?

882
01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:41.087
Awesome!

883
01:00:41.588 --> 01:00:44.524
Stop that. Sit down.

884
01:00:46.593 --> 01:00:48.094
Jung Hee. Ki Ryuh!

885
01:00:50.296 --> 01:00:52.399
You brats.

886
01:00:52.632 --> 01:00:55.402
Why are you worst students in the class...

887
01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:57.737
so excited about so early in the morning...

888
01:00:57.737 --> 01:00:59.406
and being loud?

889
01:01:02.509 --> 01:01:06.079
Jung Hee and Ki Ryuh. You will begin meditation.

890
01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.847
- What? 
- What?

891
01:01:08.982 --> 01:01:11.518
"What?" Why?

892
01:01:11.818 --> 01:01:12.919
You don't want to?

893
01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.922
Then do you want to get ready...

894
01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:17.757
and face a machine gun?

895
01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:21.728
- No. 
- Begin.

896
01:01:32.539 --> 01:01:34.207
While Jung Hee and Ki Ryuh...

897
01:01:35.408 --> 01:01:37.377
meditate this morning,

898
01:01:37.844 --> 01:01:41.381
I will introduce you to a new transfer student.

899
01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:43.650
- A transfer student? 
- Cool.

900
01:01:45.218 --> 01:01:46.252
Quiet.

901
01:01:49.155 --> 01:01:50.256
Come in.

902
01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:56.996
- She's so pretty. 
- Wow.

903
01:01:57.731 --> 01:01:59.899
- She's really pretty. 
- Seriously.

904
01:02:00.066 --> 01:02:02.569
- She's super pretty. 
- She is not.

905
01:02:04.504 --> 01:02:07.240
That girl is a high school student?

906
01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:13.379
Of all timing...

907
01:02:13.546 --> 01:02:15.882
Say hi to the class.

908
01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.186
Hello.

909
01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:23.490
I'm Park Hae Joo. I transferred from Seoul.

910
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:26.192
- Seoul? 
- Wow.

911
01:02:26.192 --> 01:02:28.862
- She's so pretty. 
- She's a Seoul girl.

912
01:02:31.631 --> 01:02:33.299
How humiliating.

913
01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:38.938
What is this...

914
01:02:39.939 --> 01:02:41.574
nervous feeling...

915
01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:43.276
that's sweeping over me again?

916
01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.556
(Girls' Generation 1979)

917
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:32.458
Jung Hee, isn't that your brother?

918
01:03:32.692 --> 01:03:34.828
Are they all here to see Hae Joo?

919
01:03:34.828 --> 01:03:36.863
What's so pretty about her?

920
01:03:36.863 --> 01:03:38.731
You told the teacher, didn't you?

921
01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:40.867
I really didn't do it.

922
01:03:40.867 --> 01:03:43.136
Jung Hee, just wait.

923
01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:45.438
Do you work at the pharmacy?

924
01:03:45.438 --> 01:03:47.841
Didn't you help us with our move?

925
01:03:47.841 --> 01:03:49.709
Joint? With Gaeryong?

926
01:03:49.709 --> 01:03:52.345
While preparing the show, you and Jin...

927
01:03:52.345 --> 01:03:53.880
It's too soon to relax.

928
01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.549
That pretty Seoul girl may be an obstacle.
