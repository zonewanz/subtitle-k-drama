1
00:00:18.408 --> 00:00:19.449
Again.

2
00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:21.449
It's that dream again.

3
00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:26.449
It hasn't happened yet,

4
00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.749
but the dream makes me feel like I'm already there.

5
00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.039
I feel as if I'm still in the midst of that dream even after waking up.

6
00:00:44.298 --> 00:00:47.669
It makes me feel like morning will never come.

7
00:00:48.108 --> 00:00:49.408
It is a complete nightmare.

8
00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:54.809
(Episode 9)

9
00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.048
There's a sound that wakes me up from the nightmare.

10
00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:02.218
It comforts me by letting me know...

11
00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:05.688
that the night and the nightmare are gone for the time being.

12
00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:08.828
It tells me, "Morning is here. You're okay now."

13
00:01:08.828 --> 00:01:10.298
It makes me feel relieved.

14
00:01:12.298 --> 00:01:15.628
To me, my mom is like the morning that banishes nights.

15
00:01:18.298 --> 00:01:21.468
Goodness, you kill me.

16
00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:27.149
I can't believe you're my daughter.

17
00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.408
Look at this mess. Your room looks like a pigsty.

18
00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:32.448
This is why I can't eat pork.

19
00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:34.489
Pigs remind me of you.

20
00:01:37.388 --> 00:01:38.758
Mom.

21
00:01:39.188 --> 00:01:41.329
Let me sleep like this for just five more minutes.

22
00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:44.399
What's with you? You're too old for this.

23
00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:53.269
Did you have that dream again?

24
00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:56.938
Yes.

25
00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.948
Gosh, I must be going crazy.

26
00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:48.829
Why do you leave so early these days?

27
00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.198
Do you have to meet someone?

28
00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:53.869
No, I'm leaving early to avoid someone.

29
00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:55.968
Who's that someone?

30
00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:00.869
Who is it?

31
00:03:01.508 --> 00:03:02.938
Okay, thank you.

32
00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:07.448
Jae Chan, the neighbor brought us mackerel.

33
00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:08.809
Can you go get it?

34
00:03:10.718 --> 00:03:11.918
Hey, you go.

35
00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:13.589
Just go. I have to go to the bathroom.

36
00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.019
No, I can't. She'll get the wrong idea if I see her looking like this.

37
00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.188
Why? You look good.

38
00:03:17.188 --> 00:03:19.158
Exactly. That's the problem.

39
00:03:19.158 --> 00:03:20.788
I'm too dressed up for just getting mackerel.

40
00:03:20.788 --> 00:03:22.929
It doesn't look natural. She'll totally get the wrong idea.

41
00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.059
I don't want any more misunderstandings, okay?

42
00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.568
What is this nonsense about?

43
00:03:26.568 --> 00:03:28.929
- Hey, please. - Gosh, let go!

44
00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:30.568
- I have to poop! - Hey, Seung Won.

45
00:03:30.568 --> 00:03:33.168
You brat. Hey! That little...

46
00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:44.749
It was you, Ms. Yoon.

47
00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.789
Your brother told me that you guys don't eat much breakfast.

48
00:03:49.148 --> 00:03:51.388
That's not good, especially for men. You'll be tired all day.

49
00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:53.229
I wrapped them individually.

50
00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.929
Keep them in your freezer and grill one at a time.

51
00:03:55.188 --> 00:03:57.398
They're already salted, so all you need to do is grill them.

52
00:03:57.398 --> 00:03:59.698
It's much easier than making ramyeon.

53
00:03:59.898 --> 00:04:01.169
Okay, thank you.

54
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:05.268
You must like mackerel. Gosh, I should've given you some sooner.

55
00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.518
You've been coming early these days.

56
00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:18.849
Yes. I'd like a double-shot Americano with...

57
00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.688
With hazelnut syrup, right? The lady with short hair just ordered it.

58
00:04:22.688 --> 00:04:25.419
She went to the washroom. She'll be back shortly.

59
00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:27.559
She came here this early?

60
00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:28.588
Yes.

61
00:04:28.859 --> 00:04:31.729
It looked like you two kept missing each other,

62
00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:35.128
so I told her that she'll be able to see you if she comes earlier.

63
00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:38.338
- Aren't you glad I told her? - No, why did you do that?

64
00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:40.068
She's back.

65
00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:43.208
Gosh. For goodness' sake.

66
00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.028
A double-shot Americano with hazelnut syrup.

67
00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:41.299
Right?

68
00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.999
Gosh, are you stalking me or what? Do you have nothing else to do?

69
00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:45.239
That's right. I have nothing to do.

70
00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:47.838
Do you have early morning meetings these days?

71
00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:49.578
I didn't know you've been leaving so early.

72
00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:51.039
I wasted my time for a few days.

73
00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.448
You said you're taking time off work. Shouldn't you go back?

74
00:05:53.448 --> 00:05:55.708
Then you won't be able to see me often.

75
00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:58.778
- Do you really want that? - Yes, I do. Very desperately.

76
00:05:58.878 --> 00:06:02.859
I'm sorry, but I enjoy seeing your face much more than working.

77
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.989
Isn't it just about not wanting to return to work?

78
00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.969
It's not that I don't want to go back.

79
00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:19.438
Shall I return to work or not?

80
00:06:21.438 --> 00:06:22.979
Why are you asking me?

81
00:06:23.438 --> 00:06:25.239
I really don't know what to do.

82
00:06:31.078 --> 00:06:32.719
Half of me wants to go back,

83
00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:34.619
but the other half doesn't.

84
00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:36.758
(Return to Work Request)

85
00:06:37.518 --> 00:06:39.318
So, you decide for me.

86
00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:42.088
I'll do as you say.

87
00:06:44.128 --> 00:06:47.429
Shall I go back to work or not?

88
00:06:48.628 --> 00:06:49.969
Is it stressful to work as a reporter?

89
00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:51.768
You don't want to return to your job that much?

90
00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:56.878
It's not that. I want to go back to work.

91
00:06:58.338 --> 00:07:00.148
I want to return so badly.

92
00:07:15.458 --> 00:07:17.458
(Seoul Hangang District Prosecutors' Office)

93
00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:21.568
You're looking great.

94
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:22.869
I was born with good looks.

95
00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:24.838
- Are you dating someone? - I sure am.

96
00:07:26.109 --> 00:07:27.169
Seriously?

97
00:07:27.438 --> 00:07:28.938
Yes, I'm committed to my cases.

98
00:07:30.278 --> 00:07:32.138
I see, your cases.

99
00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:38.119
- Hello. - Lawyer Lee!

100
00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:39.419
Good morning, everyone.

101
00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:40.448
- Hello. - Good morning.

102
00:07:40.818 --> 00:07:42.049
Press the close button.

103
00:07:43.018 --> 00:07:44.059
Get in.

104
00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:45.088
I'll take the next one.

105
00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:46.188
I guess he's going down.

106
00:07:48.128 --> 00:07:50.099
Just get in. There's so much space here.

107
00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:51.398
- Not really. - Please move back.

108
00:07:51.398 --> 00:07:53.499
- There isn't much space at all. - Hold on a second.

109
00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:54.729
- Isn't he going down? - Gosh.

110
00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:55.798
- It'll be quick. - Come on.

111
00:07:56.138 --> 00:07:57.369
Get in.

112
00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:00.109
I have to go relieve myself. Gosh.

113
00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:02.408
Hey, he has to go to the washroom. Just get in already.

114
00:08:07.609 --> 00:08:09.378
I would've been in trouble had he stalled us longer.

115
00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:10.678
That was...

116
00:08:13.719 --> 00:08:15.189
Have you made any progress yet?

117
00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:16.888
Things got done so quickly back in my days.

118
00:08:18.058 --> 00:08:20.558
Back then, a month was all I needed to...

119
00:08:20.558 --> 00:08:22.628
Enough. There are a lot of people here.

120
00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:25.628
I got awarded for my performance as a prosecutor in a month.

121
00:08:27.768 --> 00:08:30.268
Was that an inappropriate thing to say in front of you all?

122
00:08:30.268 --> 00:08:31.798
- No. - Not at all.

123
00:08:34.268 --> 00:08:37.479
You must've thought I was talking about a different kind of progress.

124
00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:39.808
About Ms. Nam Hong Joo?

125
00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.048
Nam Hong Joo?

126
00:08:46.249 --> 00:08:47.249
See you all later.

127
00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:48.548
- See you. - Have a good day.

128
00:08:50.089 --> 00:08:53.128
In terms of that kind of progress, I was much faster than you.

129
00:08:53.258 --> 00:08:54.758
- Going up. - You better step up your game.

130
00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:02.199
What progress? The kind that we're thinking of?

131
00:09:02.798 --> 00:09:03.939
The rumors must be true.

132
00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:06.168
I heard that he stole Lawyer Lee's girlfriend.

133
00:09:06.908 --> 00:09:08.969
- Are you serious? - I can hear everything.

134
00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:14.079
Since you heard us, you should give us an explanation.

135
00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:17.148
Such rumors always get out of hand if you don't do anything about them.

136
00:09:17.219 --> 00:09:20.089
The more I try to give excuses, the more they'll get out of control.

137
00:09:20.749 --> 00:09:24.089
About Ms. Nam Hong Joo... What's she like?

138
00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:25.388
I don't know.

139
00:09:25.388 --> 00:09:27.888
Nam Hong Joo? The girl at Hong Joo Samgyeopsal?

140
00:09:27.888 --> 00:09:29.288
- Yes. - She makes great kimchi stew.

141
00:09:29.288 --> 00:09:30.298
Yes, her.

142
00:09:30.298 --> 00:09:32.258
We'll be able to see her there. Have you been?

143
00:09:32.258 --> 00:09:33.268
No, not yet.

144
00:09:33.268 --> 00:09:37.268
But I heard that she's very pretty and intelligent.

145
00:09:37.268 --> 00:09:39.508
Pretty and intelligent? I wonder what she's like.

146
00:09:39.569 --> 00:09:41.038
Would she be like Prosecutor Shin?

147
00:09:42.638 --> 00:09:44.178
Gosh, of course not.

148
00:09:44.408 --> 00:09:47.349
Right, there will never be such rumors about Prosecutor Shin.

149
00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:49.648
That's what I'm saying. She's considered...

150
00:09:50.178 --> 00:09:52.418
good-looking only when she's among average people like us.

151
00:09:52.418 --> 00:09:55.018
- Exactly. - Ms. Nam is in a different league.

152
00:09:55.648 --> 00:09:58.418
People like us can't dare to compete with her.

153
00:09:58.989 --> 00:10:00.528
Right, Lawyer Lee said...

154
00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:02.898
that she's definitely the hard-to-get type.

155
00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:05.459
She sounds like a total femme fatale.

156
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:10.969
Sorry? What did you just say? Femme... What?

157
00:10:10.969 --> 00:10:12.099
You know.

158
00:10:12.268 --> 00:10:14.908
Those women who seduce men with their beauty and intelligence...

159
00:10:15.109 --> 00:10:18.479
but never give them their hearts. Femme fatale.

160
00:10:18.979 --> 00:10:21.949
You literally picked the bones clean.

161
00:10:22.008 --> 00:10:24.048
So what is it this time? Which part was missing?

162
00:10:24.048 --> 00:10:25.349
A drumstick was missing.

163
00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:27.918
It's the best part of chicken along with wings.

164
00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:31.558
Listen. I'm not a machine. When I pack them,

165
00:10:31.719 --> 00:10:36.158
a piece may end up in a different box. It happens.

166
00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:38.898
I'll be more careful from now on. Are we good now?

167
00:10:38.898 --> 00:10:42.599
I've ordered 26 chickens from this place to date.

168
00:10:42.628 --> 00:10:44.668
If a piece or two can end up in different boxes,

169
00:10:44.668 --> 00:10:46.408
some of the boxes must have extra pieces, right?

170
00:10:46.469 --> 00:10:48.408
- Right. - But you know what?

171
00:10:48.408 --> 00:10:50.538
I've never gotten an extra piece.

172
00:10:50.538 --> 00:10:51.839
It says "one chicken" on your menu.

173
00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:54.648
Why is it that I've never had a whole chicken?

174
00:10:54.808 --> 00:10:56.749
Where did all the missing pieces go?

175
00:10:56.849 --> 00:11:00.018
Do they get put in a box and are sold as "one chicken"?

176
00:11:00.018 --> 00:11:01.788
Gosh, you're really something.

177
00:11:01.918 --> 00:11:04.689
Are you one of those customers who make unreasonable complaints?

178
00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:06.959
They complain with no proof just to rip off business owners.

179
00:11:07.058 --> 00:11:09.428
You'll be punished if I sue you.

180
00:11:09.658 --> 00:11:11.599
You want proof? I have solid evidence.

181
00:11:12.099 --> 00:11:15.398
I recorded a video from the moment the fried chicken arrived.

182
00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:17.339
The video clearly shows that...

183
00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:19.839
Hey, I asked you to pick up groceries for me.

184
00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.109
What are you doing here?

185
00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:22.638
You're such a handful.

186
00:11:23.109 --> 00:11:25.538
I gave birth to this girl, but I cannot understand her.

187
00:11:25.538 --> 00:11:28.008
Never mind. Sorry.

188
00:11:28.008 --> 00:11:29.878
It seems to be the hardest work.

189
00:11:30.278 --> 00:11:31.378
- Come here. - I'll be back, okay?

190
00:11:31.378 --> 00:11:32.378
Come on.

191
00:11:32.378 --> 00:11:33.918
- Let's go! - I'll be watching you.

192
00:11:33.918 --> 00:11:36.119
Why would you watch him? Are you the Terminator or what?

193
00:11:36.119 --> 00:11:38.058
- You kill me. Gosh. - Let go. Mom, Mom!

194
00:11:39.319 --> 00:11:44.699
(Episode 9: Don't Trust Her)

195
00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:51.969
What is wrong with you? Tell me.

196
00:11:52.099 --> 00:11:55.369
I asked you to pick up groceries. Why did you cause a scene there?

197
00:11:55.508 --> 00:11:58.638
Right. It was stupid, wasn't it?

198
00:11:59.239 --> 00:12:02.709
I used to visit the prosecution, the police, and Congress for work.

199
00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:04.979
I can't believe I'm trying to dig up dirt on a fried chicken restaurant.

200
00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:10.219
What a waste of talent. I'm throwing my talent out the window.

201
00:12:13.628 --> 00:12:15.628
So? Are you planning on returning to work?

202
00:12:17.398 --> 00:12:19.258
- You saw it? - Of course.

203
00:12:19.359 --> 00:12:21.928
It looked like you put it on your desk for me to see it.

204
00:12:23.469 --> 00:12:24.939
Why aren't you answering my question?

205
00:12:24.939 --> 00:12:26.239
Will you go back to work?

206
00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:28.239
Yes.

207
00:12:31.908 --> 00:12:34.008
You said you saw yourself dying as a reporter in your dream...

208
00:12:34.178 --> 00:12:36.119
and that you're too scared to keep the job.

209
00:12:36.378 --> 00:12:38.778
You promised me that you'd just help me out here at the restaurant.

210
00:12:38.849 --> 00:12:41.388
Why the change of heart? What happened?

211
00:12:43.119 --> 00:12:44.719
It's not that I had a change of heart.

212
00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:46.558
The future might change, you know.

213
00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:47.989
You said it's unchangeable.

214
00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:50.699
You yourself said that knowing what will happen changes nothing.

215
00:12:50.699 --> 00:12:53.168
I learned that it can change. Look at Jae Chan.

216
00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:54.599
He saved both of our lives.

217
00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:56.668
So, you'll rely on him and return to work?

218
00:12:57.969 --> 00:13:00.569
Did he say that he'll save your life? Will he protect you?

219
00:13:00.569 --> 00:13:01.609
Well...

220
00:13:02.439 --> 00:13:03.808
Not exactly.

221
00:13:04.739 --> 00:13:07.349
Let's be honest. Why can't I change my future when he was able to do it?

222
00:13:07.349 --> 00:13:09.249
You can't! You'll never be able to change it.

223
00:13:09.648 --> 00:13:12.048
Why not? It's not like he's more competent than me...

224
00:13:12.048 --> 00:13:13.619
He is! In so many ways.

225
00:13:14.018 --> 00:13:16.518
Mom, I'm your daughter.

226
00:13:17.158 --> 00:13:18.788
Do you trust him more than me?

227
00:13:18.788 --> 00:13:21.058
That's right. In my eyes,

228
00:13:21.589 --> 00:13:24.459
you're much more unreliable and weaker than him.

229
00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:27.069
You worry me a lot more, and you're much...

230
00:13:30.038 --> 00:13:31.768
You're much more precious to me.

231

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

232
00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:38.439
You're...

233
00:13:39.278 --> 00:13:40.749
the only one I have in this world,

234
00:13:42.749 --> 00:13:44.518
so don't leave me.

235
00:13:47.018 --> 00:13:48.048
Okay?

236
00:13:50.558 --> 00:13:51.619
Okay.

237
00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:01.668
All right. That's my daughter.

238
00:14:01.928 --> 00:14:03.239
Gosh, my baby.

239
00:14:10.278 --> 00:14:12.178
Oh, my gosh.

240
00:14:12.178 --> 00:14:13.609
We're here to eat some pork belly.

241
00:14:13.609 --> 00:14:14.609
Hello!

242
00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:15.979
Again?

243
00:14:15.979 --> 00:14:18.378
We had to run around this morning, so we're starving now.

244
00:14:20.249 --> 00:14:23.518
44,007, 44,008.

245
00:14:24.558 --> 00:14:25.888
44,009.

246
00:14:25.888 --> 00:14:27.258
What's he doing now?

247
00:14:28.028 --> 00:14:29.558
The protest at Gwanghwamun yesterday, you know.

248
00:14:29.729 --> 00:14:32.699
He wants to count how many people were there...

249
00:14:32.699 --> 00:14:34.628
to see who's right between the police and organizers.

250
00:14:35.099 --> 00:14:37.168
I guess he has too much time on his hands.

251
00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.199
44,015.

252
00:14:38.199 --> 00:14:40.638
Hey, Du Hyun.

253
00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:42.038
Hong Joo is supposed to come back next week.

254
00:14:42.038 --> 00:14:44.178
What's her plan? Will she come back?

255
00:14:44.178 --> 00:14:47.008
44,019. Why are you asking me? 44,020.

256
00:14:47.008 --> 00:14:50.418
I need to know how many people need the uniform.

257
00:14:50.479 --> 00:14:51.678
You're her direct supervisor.

258
00:14:51.678 --> 00:14:53.089
You need to know these things.

259
00:14:53.089 --> 00:14:55.119
- 44,024. - 4.

260
00:14:55.119 --> 00:14:56.288
- 4. - 9.

261
00:14:56.288 --> 00:14:57.959
Nine... Captain!

262
00:14:57.959 --> 00:14:59.689
I lost track because of you!

263
00:14:59.689 --> 00:15:02.689
Aren't you my direct supervisor? I don't expect help from you,

264
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:04.599
but at least don't ruin things for me.

265
00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:06.768
Hey, people will think that you're my supervisor.

266
00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:09.499
What do you want me to do? Should I count her in or not?

267
00:15:09.499 --> 00:15:11.199
1, 2.

268
00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:12.599
- Gosh, this is so frustrating. - Three.

269
00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:14.268
- 4, 5. - You cold-blooded jerk.

270
00:15:15.038 --> 00:15:18.739
- 6, 7, 8. - Goodness.

271
00:15:19.609 --> 00:15:20.979
Has he totally lost his mind?

272
00:15:22.308 --> 00:15:23.619
Let's wrap up the meeting here.

273
00:15:23.878 --> 00:15:25.878
Where are we going for lunch today?

274
00:15:25.878 --> 00:15:26.888
Today, we'll go to...

275
00:15:26.888 --> 00:15:27.888
Sir.

276
00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:32.489
Why didn't you approve my request for the DUI hit-and-run case?

277
00:15:33.089 --> 00:15:35.788
I wrote "lack of evidence" as the reason.

278
00:15:36.199 --> 00:15:38.859
Indicting the passenger for aiding and abetting DUI...

279
00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:41.099
is too harsh. Don't you know?

280
00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:44.699
He'll be acquitted anyway if the case goes to court.

281
00:15:44.939 --> 00:15:46.808
That's what happened in the trial last month.

282
00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:48.369
So, where are we going?

283
00:15:48.508 --> 00:15:49.839
- Today... - Last year,

284
00:15:50.109 --> 00:15:52.808
similar offenders were sentenced to probation in Gwangju and Daejeon.

285
00:15:52.808 --> 00:15:55.349
There was the same case in Japan,

286
00:15:55.349 --> 00:15:57.548
and the passenger was sentenced to two years in prison.

287
00:15:57.548 --> 00:15:59.648
Oh, that's right. I read about that case too.

288
00:15:59.648 --> 00:16:00.918
Is your case similar?

289
00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:03.189
Yes. No, it's actually a lot worse.

290
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:04.189
Gosh, come on.

291
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:05.859
They drank together until they were totally drunk,

292
00:16:05.859 --> 00:16:07.628
and he picked up the keys from the valet services.

293
00:16:08.058 --> 00:16:11.158
Then he asked to be driven home, saying he knows how to avoid police.

294
00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:12.869
He basically instigated the offense.

295
00:16:12.869 --> 00:16:14.798
He instigated the driver to drive under the influence.

296
00:16:19.298 --> 00:16:22.808
A nine-year-old kid lost his parents due to the accident,

297
00:16:22.808 --> 00:16:26.209
and he has to wear a colostomy bag for the rest of his life.

298
00:16:27.479 --> 00:16:30.118
None of that would've happened had he stopped the driver.

299
00:16:30.118 --> 00:16:31.919
I'm actually going very easy on him.

300
00:16:31.919 --> 00:16:33.618
It's not harsh. He deserves a heavier punishment.

301
00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:37.459
He didn't even drive. All he did was give the driver his car keys.

302
00:16:37.588 --> 00:16:41.088
We, prosecutors, should not turn innocent people into criminals.

303
00:16:41.088 --> 00:16:42.959
- Sir. - Ms. Son!

304
00:16:45.258 --> 00:16:47.328
All right. We should have lunch first.

305
00:16:47.328 --> 00:16:49.439
We can't solve any cases on an empty stomach.

306
00:16:49.439 --> 00:16:51.169
Mr. Jung, where are we going for lunch?

307
00:16:51.169 --> 00:16:54.139
We'll go to Finest Tonkatsu, the tonkatsu place across the street.

308
00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:57.179
My, look at you. Did you read my mind or what?

309
00:16:57.179 --> 00:16:58.909
I've been craving tonkatsu.

310
00:16:58.909 --> 00:17:01.209
The food at Finest Tonkatsu is really good,

311
00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:05.749
but Mr. Park drank last night, so he'll need to cure his hangover.

312
00:17:05.749 --> 00:17:08.949
I heard the kimchi stew at Hong Joo Samgyeopsal is amazing.

313
00:17:09.389 --> 00:17:11.389
That restaurant is too far. We should go somewhere closer,

314
00:17:11.389 --> 00:17:12.659
like the one across the street.

315
00:17:12.659 --> 00:17:14.629
Yes, there are many good kimchi stew places nearby.

316
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:18.159
Well, let's go to Hong Joo Samgyeopsal, then.

317
00:17:18.629 --> 00:17:20.828
It's a nice day, so we could get some exercise by walking there.

318
00:17:21.028 --> 00:17:22.469
All right, let's go.

319
00:17:22.469 --> 00:17:24.068
Hasn't the weather been so nice?

320
00:17:24.969 --> 00:17:27.969
I always get off a stop early and walk here these days.

321
00:17:29.169 --> 00:17:30.278
Let's go.

322
00:17:31.508 --> 00:17:34.048
I tried to analyze the dreams the three of us have been having.

323
00:17:34.249 --> 00:17:36.379
You've been seeing a bunch of random people in your dreams,

324
00:17:36.379 --> 00:17:38.679
but Jae Chan has been appearing in them frequently as of late.

325
00:17:38.949 --> 00:17:40.449
- Right. - It looks like Jae Chan...

326
00:17:40.449 --> 00:17:42.048
usually has dreams about you,

327
00:17:42.318 --> 00:17:43.919
and I've been mainly having dreams about him.

328
00:17:44.518 --> 00:17:46.858
Really? That is odd.

329
00:17:47.028 --> 00:17:48.558
There are definitely some kinds of rules.

330
00:17:49.258 --> 00:17:51.028
You started having these dreams first.

331
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:53.429
After that, it was Jae Chan. Then it happened to me too.

332
00:17:53.429 --> 00:17:56.598
If this was a contagious disease, you'd be the first infectee,

333
00:17:56.899 --> 00:17:59.239
but it's obviously not spread through air or physical contact.

334
00:17:59.399 --> 00:18:01.669
Had it been the case, a lot more people would've been infected.

335
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:04.379
Hey, do you think I'm sick?

336
00:18:04.379 --> 00:18:06.479
Come on. I was just using that analogy to explain better.

337
00:18:07.409 --> 00:18:08.879
Do you not like those dreams?

338
00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:09.879
No, I don't.

339
00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.889
I wonder if I did something terrible in my past life.

340
00:18:13.018 --> 00:18:14.389
It must be a punishment of some sort.

341
00:18:14.588 --> 00:18:17.419
No, you must've saved the country or something in your past life.

342
00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:18.858
If we can find out what the rules are,

343
00:18:18.858 --> 00:18:20.558
we'll be able to prevent...

344
00:18:20.588 --> 00:18:22.229
all sorts of crimes and disasters.

345
00:18:22.558 --> 00:18:25.729
Hang on. What if I see a war or a terrorist attack in my dreams?

346
00:18:26.699 --> 00:18:29.768
Hong Joo, we should master a foreign language...

347
00:18:30.098 --> 00:18:32.499
in order to prevent such disasters at an international level.

348
00:18:32.499 --> 00:18:35.209
I can speak a little bit of German.

349
00:18:36.479 --> 00:18:38.078
- Good morning. - Lieutenant Han has...

350
00:18:38.078 --> 00:18:40.179
such good manners.

351
00:18:40.179 --> 00:18:42.379
He's handsome, and he has American-style manners.

352
00:18:43.018 --> 00:18:44.818
It's because he learned from me.

353
00:18:44.818 --> 00:18:46.989
I mean, he even looks just like me.

354
00:18:47.118 --> 00:18:51.018
People always assume that he's my little brother and tell me...

355
00:18:51.018 --> 00:18:52.788
that I've done such a good job of raising him.

356
00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.159
I can get a cash receipt, right?

357
00:18:55.159 --> 00:18:57.159
- Yes, of course. - Thank you.

358
00:18:57.199 --> 00:18:58.729
You seem so excited.

359
00:18:59.629 --> 00:19:01.199
Do you like having such dreams?

360
00:19:01.199 --> 00:19:02.469
Of course I do.

361
00:19:02.939 --> 00:19:05.239
What if you have a dream about your death?

362
00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:09.538
Don't say such an ominous thing.

363
00:19:09.808 --> 00:19:11.338
Well, you're a cop.

364
00:19:11.578 --> 00:19:14.108
What if you see yourself die while working on a tough case?

365
00:19:14.348 --> 00:19:15.608
Will you quit your job?

366
00:19:15.649 --> 00:19:19.318
Are you crazy? Do you know what I went through to become a cop?

367
00:19:20.189 --> 00:19:22.189
You might die though.

368
00:19:22.318 --> 00:19:24.219
Then I'll just change my future.

369
00:19:26.629 --> 00:19:27.788
I'll just have to change it.

370
00:19:28.588 --> 00:19:29.828
It can be changed.

371
00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:35.229
Really? Do you really think so?

372
00:19:37.399 --> 00:19:38.399
Get out!

373
00:19:42.008 --> 00:19:43.278
Mother, what's the matter?

374
00:19:43.278 --> 00:19:44.578
Don't call me like that. Get out.

375
00:19:44.639 --> 00:19:46.078
I said, get out!

376
00:19:46.449 --> 00:19:47.479
Mom.

377
00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:49.479
- Mother, why are you... - I'm not your mother.

378
00:19:49.479 --> 00:19:51.379
Stop spewing nonsense. Get out already!

379
00:19:51.379 --> 00:19:52.518
Go on. Get out!

380
00:19:52.518 --> 00:19:53.689
I'll get going, then.

381
00:20:08.699 --> 00:20:10.239
Why is she being like that all of a sudden?

382
00:20:10.239 --> 00:20:11.999
Did I say something inappropriate?

383
00:20:12.139 --> 00:20:14.969
No, I think she's mad at me.

384
00:20:16.068 --> 00:20:17.739
I asked her for a cash receipt.

385
00:20:17.879 --> 00:20:21.078
Gosh, why did you do that? It wasn't even that much.

386
00:20:21.078 --> 00:20:23.048
She even gave us free rice.

387
00:20:23.048 --> 00:20:25.879
- Gosh. - Gosh.

388
00:20:33.758 --> 00:20:34.758
Is that Han Woo Tak?

389
00:20:38.828 --> 00:20:40.469
(Prosecutor, Cop)

390
00:20:44.538 --> 00:20:45.538
Hello.

391
00:20:45.538 --> 00:20:46.538
Hello!

392
00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:47.969
You can take any table you like.

393
00:20:52.538 --> 00:20:55.308
My gosh. Hello, Prosecutor Jung.

394
00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:59.419
Oh, look at you. It seems like you know the owner well.

395
00:20:59.419 --> 00:21:01.018
Of course, he's our regular customer.

396
00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:05.018
Does that mean the rumor about you two is true?

397
00:21:05.018 --> 00:21:06.489
No, it is not true.

398
00:21:07.189 --> 00:21:10.929
Will we get some soda on the house if Prosecutor Jung is a regular?

399
00:21:11.199 --> 00:21:14.929
I think people who demand complimentary soda...

400
00:21:14.929 --> 00:21:17.999
or free appetizers at restaurants look so cheap.

401
00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:19.538
It's like they want to rip people off.

402
00:21:19.939 --> 00:21:22.709
No, not at all. Of course we'll give you something on the house.

403
00:21:23.608 --> 00:21:25.179
Just a moment, please.

404
00:21:26.308 --> 00:21:29.479
She must be Ms. Nam Hong Joo. She's so pretty.

405
00:21:29.479 --> 00:21:31.749
She also seems very intelligent. How should I describe her?

406
00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:33.489
The femme fatale type?

407
00:21:36.189 --> 00:21:37.358
What is it called again?

408
00:21:39.018 --> 00:21:40.028
Femme...

409
00:21:42.258 --> 00:21:46.768
Lord, you always give us your wisdom and grace.

410
00:21:46.768 --> 00:21:49.399
Please allow every prosecutor in Criminal Division Three...

411
00:21:49.399 --> 00:21:53.368
to benefit from your wisdom so that we can always...

412
00:21:53.368 --> 00:21:56.578
make sure to prosecute every offender fairly.

413
00:21:56.739 --> 00:21:59.338
A kid became an orphan due to an unfortunate accident,

414
00:21:59.449 --> 00:22:01.749
and he has to live with disabilities for the rest of his life.

415
00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:05.278
Both the person who caused the accident and the one...

416
00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:07.818
who let the accident happen instead of stopping it are sinners.

417
00:22:08.219 --> 00:22:10.419
Our Lord who is fair, please use your sword...

418
00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:12.719
to also punish the one who chose not to prevent the accident.

419
00:22:12.719 --> 00:22:16.058
Such accidents are considered crimes of criminal negligence.

420
00:22:16.058 --> 00:22:18.959
Since it was a mistake, aiding or abetting it was simply impossible.

421
00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:20.868
Therefore, we cannot accuse him of such an offense...

422
00:22:20.868 --> 00:22:23.098
Driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to accidents,

423
00:22:23.298 --> 00:22:26.068
so the accident could have been predicted and prevented.

424
00:22:26.068 --> 00:22:27.068
Absolutely.

425
00:22:27.068 --> 00:22:29.808
Father, the person who turned a blind eye to it all...

426
00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:32.709
certainly deserves a punishment, and that's why the law exists.

427
00:22:32.709 --> 00:22:36.348
According to that logic, everyone who hasn't made any donations...

428
00:22:36.348 --> 00:22:40.048
to starving children all over the world also deserves punishment.

429
00:22:40.048 --> 00:22:42.318
Please save us from those who are foolishly trying...

430
00:22:42.318 --> 00:22:43.518
to cloud the main issue.

431
00:22:43.518 --> 00:22:46.929
In this country, respecting elders is considered a virtue.

432
00:22:47.088 --> 00:22:48.629
We must treat our superiors with respect...

433
00:22:48.629 --> 00:22:49.659
Wait.

434
00:22:50.258 --> 00:22:52.868
Why are you talking about respecting elders and superiors?

435
00:22:52.868 --> 00:22:54.568
That's one of Confucius' teachings.

436
00:22:54.568 --> 00:22:56.639
Why can't I bring it up?

437
00:22:57.038 --> 00:22:58.368
Religions must unite for world peace!

438
00:22:58.469 --> 00:23:02.439
Please calm down. How about we vote to be fair and square?

439
00:23:02.639 --> 00:23:04.078
Let's handle this democratically.

440
00:23:04.078 --> 00:23:06.008
Excuse me. Please give us free soda on the house.

441
00:23:06.008 --> 00:23:08.278
No freebies, please. Make sure you add it to our bill.

442
00:23:08.278 --> 00:23:09.618
- Okay. - All right.

443
00:23:09.618 --> 00:23:11.348
Then let's vote.

444
00:23:11.578 --> 00:23:14.919
If you think the passenger also deserves to be punished,

445
00:23:14.949 --> 00:23:15.989
raise your hand.

446
00:23:22.288 --> 00:23:24.258
Please raise your hand if you disagree with that.

447
00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:30.568
Mr. Jung, what are you doing? You haven't raised your hand.

448
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:33.568
Both sides' arguments are valid,

449
00:23:33.739 --> 00:23:35.969
so I need more time to think.

450
00:23:36.479 --> 00:23:38.479
Don't worry about what others will think. Just be honest.

451
00:23:38.479 --> 00:23:40.449
Backing out now is such a cowardly thing to do.

452
00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:41.749
Aren't I right?

453
00:23:43.879 --> 00:23:46.689
Well, why are you asking me?

454
00:23:46.919 --> 00:23:50.288
I'm just curious whether I'm the only one who thinks it's cowardly.

455
00:23:54.929 --> 00:23:56.098
Well...

456
00:23:56.999 --> 00:23:59.058
I think that a prayer like this in and of itself goes against...

457
00:24:00.528 --> 00:24:04.139
religious neutrality which public officials are expected to observe.

458
00:24:04.838 --> 00:24:07.739
Well, all four of us are Christians.

459
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:09.808
No way. That can't be.

460
00:24:10.078 --> 00:24:11.139
Pardon me?

461
00:24:11.739 --> 00:24:15.209
Only 20 percent of Korea's population is Christian.

462
00:24:15.379 --> 00:24:17.548
It means that the probability of all four of you being Christian...

463
00:24:17.548 --> 00:24:20.118
is 0.2 to the power of 4, which equals 0.0016.

464
00:24:20.518 --> 00:24:23.858
It's less than the probability of seeing a double rainbow.

465
00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:25.288
In other words, it's impossible.

466
00:24:27.058 --> 00:24:29.499
I bet some of you are hiding your actual religion...

467
00:24:29.499 --> 00:24:31.758
to make sure you don't get on your superior's wrong side.

468
00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:34.629
And not praying along in this kind of organizational culture...

469
00:24:34.868 --> 00:24:36.899
shows that the person is not afraid of expressing his beliefs.

470
00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:42.268
I don't think he's scared or worried about what others might think.

471
00:24:42.939 --> 00:24:45.379
He must be thinking hard about what would be the right thing to do.

472
00:24:45.479 --> 00:24:47.278
He's being more careful than any of you.

473
00:24:48.848 --> 00:24:50.149
Does that answer your question?

474
00:24:53.588 --> 00:24:55.489
My gosh, who is that young lady?

475
00:24:55.489 --> 00:24:57.159
She's extremely well-spoken.

476
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:01.689
The way she talks...

477
00:25:02.798 --> 00:25:04.558
It sounds familiar.

478
00:25:18.538 --> 00:25:19.608
Nam Hong Joo!

479
00:25:19.608 --> 00:25:20.709
My gosh.

480
00:25:20.709 --> 00:25:22.008
You startled us.

481
00:25:22.278 --> 00:25:24.679
That lady at the restaurant. She's a reporter.

482
00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:25.818
Reporter Nam Hong Joo.

483
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:28.118
She was a city desk reporter at SBC.

484
00:25:29.689 --> 00:25:32.318
I couldn't recognize her because she cut her hair, but it's her.

485
00:25:32.618 --> 00:25:34.129
I thought her voice sounded familiar.

486
00:25:34.459 --> 00:25:35.689
What was she like as a reporter?

487
00:25:36.499 --> 00:25:38.629
Gosh, she was a tough cookie.

488
00:25:39.469 --> 00:25:40.499
Please say a few words.

489
00:25:40.499 --> 00:25:43.739
She always snagged the best spot whenever we were escorting suspects.

490
00:25:43.739 --> 00:25:45.239
- Say something to your son! - She'd come up...

491
00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:46.669
and bombard us with questions.

492
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:48.008
She was so loud too.

493
00:25:48.008 --> 00:25:49.578
She was always yelling at the top of her lungs.

494
00:25:49.578 --> 00:25:51.108
Please say a few words!

495
00:25:51.108 --> 00:25:53.778
The news that an assistant chief prosecutor has been molesting...

496
00:25:53.778 --> 00:25:56.979
female prosecutors at team dinners has left many of us shocked.

497
00:25:57.249 --> 00:25:58.318
Was it two years ago?

498
00:25:58.348 --> 00:26:00.419
The sexual assault incident at Yeonju Prosecutors' Office.

499
00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:02.419
She was the one who got the assistant chief prosecutor fired.

500
00:26:02.419 --> 00:26:05.959
He touched particular parts of the female prosecutors' bodies...

501
00:26:05.959 --> 00:26:07.889
and sexually assaulted them.

502
00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:11.129
Then she suddenly fell off the face of the earth.

503
00:26:11.699 --> 00:26:14.268
I assumed she was sent somewhere overseas as a correspondent.

504
00:26:14.268 --> 00:26:17.598
So, she had a successful career. Why is she working at a restaurant now?

505
00:26:17.739 --> 00:26:20.409
You're right. I'm curious too.

506
00:26:20.409 --> 00:26:22.508
She wouldn't quit her job as a reporter.

507
00:26:22.568 --> 00:26:24.639
I should ask around.

508
00:26:30.949 --> 00:26:34.588
The organizers of the protest stated that a total...

509
00:26:34.588 --> 00:26:36.219
of 70,000 people participated.

510
00:26:36.219 --> 00:26:38.288
However, the number that the police announced...

511
00:26:38.288 --> 00:26:41.189
is 15,000, which is significantly less.

512
00:26:41.929 --> 00:26:44.298
The difference was caused...

513
00:26:44.399 --> 00:26:47.169
by when and how the counting was done.

514
00:26:47.598 --> 00:26:50.469
The organizers counted all protest participants from the beginning...

515
00:26:50.598 --> 00:26:54.469
Then everyone should be arrested.

516
00:26:54.469 --> 00:26:56.538
Shall we arrest and prosecute everyone in this country?

517
00:26:56.538 --> 00:26:58.709
Let's go back to how it all started.

518
00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:00.979
- Goodness. - That person is...

519
00:27:01.179 --> 00:27:02.949
- responsible for the accident. - Well, it was...

520
00:27:02.949 --> 00:27:04.518
a traffic accident, you know.

521
00:27:06.118 --> 00:27:09.389
However, I counted the total number of protest participants myself...

522
00:27:09.989 --> 00:27:12.489
- and found out that there were... - Gosh!

523
00:27:12.889 --> 00:27:15.028
about 37,000 participants by 6pm alone.

524
00:27:15.659 --> 00:27:16.828
Did you cut yourself?

525
00:27:17.798 --> 00:27:18.858
Let me see.

526
00:27:19.768 --> 00:27:21.828
Gosh, you should've been careful.

527
00:27:21.929 --> 00:27:23.739
Just leave it. I'll finish it up.

528
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:28.608
Are you crying? Does it hurt a lot?

529
00:27:28.608 --> 00:27:30.078
Shall I take you to a hospital?

530
00:27:31.209 --> 00:27:34.348
Mom, I don't think these onions are fresh. My eyes are burning too much.

531
00:28:38.657 --> 00:28:42.957
(Episode 10 will air shortly.)
