00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.110
(The Master Key, Angel Versus Demon)

2
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.709
Among 12 keys the members have,

3
00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.090
one of the keys is Angel's Master
Key, and one is Demon's Master Key.

4
00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.759
(Angel's Master Key and
Demon's Master Key)

5
00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.020
(There are Angel and Demon
among these players.)

6
00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.660
(The Master Key's Game has become
more difficult.)

7
00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.500
I can't really lie to people
as I am quite an innocent person.

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.300
(Players fight to find the Angel.)

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.140
(Someone is lying.)

10
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.470
(The truth starts to come out.)

11
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.639
- You are the Demon.
- I am 100 percent sure.

12
00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:43.580
(Who are the Demon and Angel?)

13
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.279
- Hello.
- Hello.

14
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.319
- Hello.
- Hello.

15
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.050
(Fantastic players appear
with fresh breeze of autumn air.)

16
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.359
Hello.

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.359
- Hello.
- Hello.

18
00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:00.989
- Here is Chan Yeol.
- Hello.

19
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.499
Why are you so dressed up today,
Chan Yeol?

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.970
Hello.

21
00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:08.370
Min Ho is here too.

22
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.700
(The swag master of Winner,
Song Min Ho)

23
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:12.870
Hello.

24
00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.210
Hello.

25
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.040
(Jin Young of Got7,
Key of SHINee)

26
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.109
Do I have to go there?

27
00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.439
I am finally here at Master Key.

28
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.049
Cheers.

29
00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.279
(Actress Lee Sun Bin,
Sana of Twice)

30
00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:25.950
- Hello.
- How are you?

31
00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:28.419
You look good today.

32
00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:29.790
(The healing-inducing leader of
NU'EST, JR)

33
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.630
It will be so hard to read her face
since she is an actress.

34
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.559
- We are here.
- What is this?

35
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.370
Take your nameplates
and enter Room of Fate.

36
00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:41.870
- This is the Room of Fate.
- It feels different today.

37
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.169
We don't look for the keys anymore.

38
00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.299
It's better that way.

39
00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:46.340
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

40
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.809
- It looks nice in here.
- Do I take my nameplate with me?

41
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.409
- Hello.
- Hello.

42
00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.809
The room looks different today.

43
00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.480
- Hello.
- It looks different today.

44
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.120
The keys look different too.

45
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.090
We didn't have this before.

46
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.189
I like it.

47
00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.590
(12 keys are placed randomly.)

48
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.919
- Come inside.
- That is your cabinet.

49
00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.889
You just have to choose the key
that you think is the Master Key.

50
00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:09.400
You can stand anywhere.
Take your nameplate with you.

51
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.400
(As soon as they choose their key,
they become the owner of the key.)

52
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.700
Stand in front of the key
you choose.

53
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.200
- There is nothing special.
- There isn't.

54
00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.200
- I don't know where to stand.
- Don't think too hard.

55
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.669
You can just stand anywhere
you want.

56
00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.910
- Do I just stand here like this?
- You can choose first.

57
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.139
No, you can choose first.

58
00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.209
Do you want to stand here?

59
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.250
- Sana, did you choose the key?
- We have to work together.

60
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.649
- I will stand here.
- You have to discuss with me.

61
00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.480
(They have finished choosing
their places.)

62
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.179
- We have a lot to discuss.
- Min Ho.

63
00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.649
We have the best players today.
It is going to be fun today.

64
00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:37.459
What do you think?

65
00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.459
- JR.
- Yes?

66
00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.560
What do you think
of today's players?

67
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.630
- What?
- We have the best players today.

68
00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.200
- You want to team up with them?
- They are so handsome.

69
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.929
Who is the youngest player here?

70
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.730
- How old is Key?
- I am 22 years old.

71
00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.669
- How old are you, Seong Wu?
- I am 23 years old.

72
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.169
You must be their senior, right?

73
00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:55.239
No.

74
00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.480
- I debuted in 2014.
- Oh, really?

75
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.649
I am sorry, but I can't talk
casually to Sun Bin.

76
00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.720
I am 24 years old.

77
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.019
- Are you?
- She's still young.

78
00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.589
We thought she was older than that
as she is a great actress.

79
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.389
It will be the talk of town today...

80
00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.489
since we have the hottest
celebrities as today's players.

81
00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.530
- Yes.
- Right?

82
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.700
The rules have changed from
this week.

83
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.869
- It's a psychological warfare.
- Exactly.

84
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.169
Key Man will tell us
about the rules.

85
00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.639
Players.

86
00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.639
You can find the
real Master Key...

87
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.880
in Room of Fate.

88
00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.450
I will explain the rules
of games in Master Village.

89
00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.489
Open the cabinet in front of you.

90
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.889
There is an explanation.

91
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.760
There are 2 keys that can open...

92
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.959
the prize box among 12 keys.

93
00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.470
- Two keys.
- One is the Angel's Master Key...

94
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.200
and other one is Demon's Master Key.

95
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.769
You have to look for Angel's Master
Key and vote for the player.

96
00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:00.810
(You have to look for Angel's Master
Key and vote for the player.)

97
00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.179
If the players vote for the Angel
and open the prize box,

98
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.450
the players can win the prize...

99
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.250
- in the end.
- We have to look for the Angel.

100
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.049
(The prize will be shared to
the players equally.)

101
00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.220
If I was the Angel...

102
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.419
Angel.

103
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.160
If you were the Angel,

104
00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.430
you have to tell people to
vote for you.

105
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.700
The prize can be shared to players
equally.

106
00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.339
It will be better if more players
vote for Angel.

107
00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.310
- Sana, did you understand the rule?
- Yes.

108
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.709
If she understood,
it's good to start.

109
00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.649
However, if you vote for the Demon,

110
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.149
the number of players' votes
will multiply the prize.

111
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.920
The Demon can take the prize alone.

112
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.149
Then the players won't be able to
receive the prize.

113
00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:50.690
There will be two players then.

114
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.630
- Players who are Angel and Demon.
- That's right.

115
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.329
The Demon can tell people
that he's Angel.

116
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.800
He can win the votes like that
to take the prize.

117
00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:03.539
If 6 players vote for Demon,
his prize will be multiplied by 6.

118
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.769
It shouldn't happen like that.

119
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.969
We shouldn't let the Demon
take everything.

120
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.050
Players can also vote for a player
who doesn't have any of those keys.

121
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.120
The amount of prize will be same
as the number of players' votes.

122
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.920
The player can take the whole prize.

123
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.019
The other players won't be able
to receive the prize.

124
00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:26.430
(The player can take the prize.)

125
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.959
That means, there will be
three players.

126
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.130
Angel, Demon,
and a player with no keys.

127
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.430
A player can act like Angel.

128
00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.000
The player can also act
as Demon too.

129
00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:39.070
In that way, he can take the prize.

130
00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.079
Even if you are not Angel or Demon,
you can still win the prize...

131
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.810
by persuading people.

132
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.680
We had to use two keys to
open the prize box.

133
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.950
But now we only have to use one key.

134
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.320
I think today's episode will be...

135
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.690
a mess like dogs' fight.

136
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.260
- Because...
- It's inappropriate to say.

137
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.800
- "A mess like dog's fight."
- I haven't been on public shows.

138
00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:05.260
Which public show is this?

139
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.769
- It is a public show.
- Where are we?

140
00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:09.139
It is a public show you are on.

141
00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.440
Don't check your keys. Let's raise
hands if you think you're the Demon.

142
00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.510
Let's guess first.

143
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.680
- Sun Bin is Demon.
- Me?

144
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.680
- She's wearing dark clothes.
- I think so too.

145
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.250
I think she must be the Demon.

146
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.110
I also think I'm the Demon.

147
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.450
I think it will be hard to read her
since she is a good actress.

148
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.920
- No way.
- I think he's the one.

149
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.950
- It is also hard to read Min Ho.
- Yes.

150
00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:31.889
It will be really easy to read
Chan Yeol though.

151
00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.490
He won't find it easy to
control his facial expression.

152
00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.029
His ears will blush too.

153
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.000
Jin Young is also good at
controlling his facial expression.

154
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.630
- A poker face.
- Daniel.

155
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.099
I think JR is a hardest one to read.
He's so sly.

156
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.639
- I agree.
- Me?

157
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.870
It won't be easy to read him.

158
00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.209
Sana, are you good at
controlling your facial expression?

159
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.279
(She makes the cat face.)

160
00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:50.380
- I don't know.
- I think she's hard to read.

161
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.639
I think she's also good at
controlling her facial expression.

162
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.579
- "I don't know."
- Is she lying already?

163
00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:55.450
All right, Players.

164
00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.450
It's the time to check...

165
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.120
who has the Angel's Master Key
and Demon's Master Key.

166
00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:03.889
The first player to check is...

167
00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:06.630
Chan Yeol.

168
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.889
The easiest player goes first.

169
00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:10.729
Chan Yeol, place your key on the
cabinet...

170
00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:12.969
and ask the question.

171
00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:16.070
He looks like the actor from
"Constantine".

172
00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.070
He looks like Keanu Reeves.

173
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.510
You are Demon. I'm sure.

174
00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:23.339
- What are you talking about?
- Sorry.

175
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.050
Don't open the cabinet so wide.

176
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.149
I'm so nervous.

177
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.149
The color of light shows
that he has the Master Key.

178
00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:34.719
- The light came on.
- All right.

179
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.860
Is this key the Master Key?

180
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.159
Don't open it too wide.

181
00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.459
You have to show us your face too.

182
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.959
I don't think he will act well.

183
00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:44.800
Show us.

184
00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:47.630
I think...

185
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.969
- we caught you.
- He's the Demon.

186
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.269
He's also good at controlling
his facial expression.

187
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.339
It's Daniel's turn now.

188
00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.349
Is this key the Master Key?

189
00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:02.579
He opens it wide these days.

190
00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:05.219
What was that?

191
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.849
Why are you so bad at this?
Can't you do better than that?

192
00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:11.560
- He might act that way on purpose.
- Yes.

193
00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:13.289
(What will Daniel be?)

194
00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:15.159
What was that?

195
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.029
It will be hard to read Min Ho.

196
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.829
He is just...

197
00:08:19.229 --> 00:08:20.930
It will be hard to read Min Ho.

198
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.130
Is this key...

199
00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.700
- the Master Key?
- I think he has the Key.

200
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.670
- I think he has one.
- Min Ho.

201
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.639
Gosh, Min Ho.

202
00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:31.380
- Gosh.
- Whatever.

203
00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:33.250
Isn't it good to be Angel?

204
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.279
(He tells people
that he's the Angel.)

205
00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.719
- He's so bad at lying.
- He's not Angel.

206
00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:40.390
- Min Ho, you are so bad at this.
- It said I'm the Angel.

207
00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:43.259
He's saying that he's the Angel.

208
00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:46.190
- Is this key the Master Key?
- Is this key the Master Key?

209
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.959
Seong Wu can act well too.

210
00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:51.229
I hope none of them are Demon.

211
00:08:51.229 --> 00:08:53.070
- I think one of them is Demon.
- Firstly,

212
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.270
it will be better to team up
with me.

213
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.070
We can all team up.

214
00:08:58.239 --> 00:08:59.940
I think it was a wrong choice
to wear this outfit today.

215
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.209
Because you are Angel?

216
00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:04.440
Look at his neck.
He's wearing a Demon's belt.

217
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.209
We caught you.

218
00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:07.979
- Put your key in.
- Is this key...

219
00:09:07.979 --> 00:09:09.520
the Master Key?

220
00:09:09.719 --> 00:09:10.879
Master Key.

221
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.690
His name is also Key.

222
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.989
- He is Mr. Key.
- What Key are you?

223
00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:16.890
Did you see his face?

224
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.459
I am sure about Key.

225
00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:19.959
He looks flustered.

226
00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:21.459
Next player.

227
00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:24.560
Is this key the Master Key?

228
00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:26.869
Is this key the Master Key?

229
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.400
It's idol singer versus
the sly player.

230
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:30.869
It's idol singer versus
the sly player.

231
00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:34.369
(The players' facial expression is
also important when deciding.)

232
00:09:34.369 --> 00:09:36.109
- Did you see Jin Young's face?
- He looked awkward.

233
00:09:36.109 --> 00:09:38.410
- What?
- Did you see?

234
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.009
- You have the Master Key.
- He has one.

235
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.180
Is this key the Master Key?

236
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.050
No way.

237
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.349
- Does he?
- No way.

238
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.550
(Gosh)

239
00:09:52.219 --> 00:09:53.629
He's funny.

240
00:09:53.729 --> 00:09:55.959
He's trying so hard.

241
00:09:55.959 --> 00:09:57.099
(He's good at overreacting.)

242
00:09:57.099 --> 00:09:58.400
Do you need to go to the bathroom?

243
00:09:59.369 --> 00:10:01.200
I was surprised. Next.

244
00:10:02.129 --> 00:10:04.440
(He's good at making people laugh.)

245
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.440
Is this key the Master Key?

246
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.479
- She's cute.
- Master Key.

247
00:10:09.479 --> 00:10:11.310
Is this key the Master Key?

248
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.479
- Master Key.
- Master Key.

249
00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:14.709
- Master Key.
- Master Key.

250
00:10:14.709 --> 00:10:15.780
Show me.

251
00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:18.950
I think he has one.

252
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.849
(His acting never gets better.)

253
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.690
Did you really have to
act like that?

254
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:27.959
- She's pretty.
- Look at her.

255
00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:29.099
Is she the Angel?

256
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.459
Is this key the Master Key?

257
00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:32.499
No.

258
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.869
A lot of people want to be
friends with me

259
00:10:38.869 --> 00:10:40.440
Why is mine playing music?

260
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.479
That's strange.

261
00:10:42.579 --> 00:10:45.280
(He sings "Angel with No Wings"
to tell people that he's the Angel.)

262
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.979
Why are you singing that song?

263
00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:49.749
Why is there a long sentence
on mine?

264
00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:51.979
- What?
- It says "You are X", right?

265
00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:54.219
No. It doesn't say that.

266
00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:56.759
Doesn't it say that
"Your key is Angel's Master Key"?

267
00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:57.759
I got O.

268
00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:00.489
- How many Angels do we have then?
- O shows that you are Angel.

269
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.700
Everyone is trying so hard.

270
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.300
The Angel must work hard.

271
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.930
If you are the Angel,

272
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.770
you only have to find the Demon.

273
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.030
I am sure of it.

274
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.969
He keeps saying that he's Angel.

275
00:11:10.969 --> 00:11:13.270
Why do you think I do that?
Just trust me for once.

276
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.839
Raise your hands if you are
the Angel.

277
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.910
- What a joke.
- But...

278
00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:18.910
Raise your hands if you are
the Angel.

279
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.479
(Everyone is Angel.)

280
00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:23.550
(There is only one key for Angel.)

281
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.320
Jin Young, why didn't you raise
your hand?

282
00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:27.020
- Why didn't you?
- Because he's Demon.

283
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.589
Everyone is saying that
they are Angel.

284
00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:32.829
- Gosh. That was unexpected.
- He's good.

285
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.089
Okay then.

286
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.999
Players, please move to
the locker room.

287
00:11:37.999 --> 00:11:39.030
Let's go.

288
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.499
Angel and Demon must remain here.
Everyone else can go.

289
00:11:41.499 --> 00:11:42.800
I have to discuss something
with them.

290
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.040
No one will leave then.

291
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.739
Why do you keep telling people?

292
00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.810
Players who received X
always talk a lot.

293
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.739
Doesn't Angel have to tell others?

294
00:11:50.739 --> 00:11:53.009
I sang the song earlier.

295
00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:56.079
- Is that why you sang the song?
- Yes.

296
00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:58.280
No one knows the song
since they are all young.

297
00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.719
Only Key must know the song then.

298
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:00.989
Gosh.

299
00:12:00.989 --> 00:12:02.660
I think you really are Angel.

300
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.790
Can you give me Angel's wings
with computer graphics?

301
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.930
Please make the wings for me.

302
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.700
You guys are so bad at this.

303
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:12.900
We shouldn't act like that
at this stage.

304
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.030
Do we go that way?

305
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.229
Angel must...

306
00:12:15.229 --> 00:12:17.469
I can tell others about myself
if I am Angel, right?

307
00:12:17.469 --> 00:12:19.509
Yes. It's better to tell others.

308
00:12:19.869 --> 00:12:22.040
- The rules changed.
- Yes.

309
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.379
- Are you Angel?
- Yes.

310
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.349
You're so mean.

311
00:12:26.349 --> 00:12:28.609
- I am the Angel.
- He also says that he is the Angel.

312
00:12:28.609 --> 00:12:31.379
Min Ho is not the Angel.

313
00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:34.089
If I were the Angel, everyone must
work together to win the prize.

314
00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:35.920
I am the Angel.
Why do you keep saying you are?

315
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.219
I am the Angel.

316
00:12:37.219 --> 00:12:39.660
We have three Angels already.

317
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.989
He is not the Angel.

318
00:12:40.989 --> 00:12:42.700
Key, you have to
trust your instinct.

319
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.400
- Gosh.
- Look at him.

320
00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:48.629
Henry, you're acting weird today.

321
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.999
Min Ho, why don't you exercise?

322
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.369
Me? Angel doesn't need to exercise.

323
00:12:54.969 --> 00:12:56.940
I just have to tell others
if I am the Angel, right?

324
00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:59.079
I just have to tell others
if I am the Angel, right?

325
00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:00.109
- No.
- Everyone else is doing it.

326
00:13:00.109 --> 00:13:02.820
You guys can suit yourselves.

327
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.780
"You guys can suit yourselves."

328
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.820
JR, come here. Let's go.

329
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.420
You guys can stay here.

330
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.790
Where are we going?

331
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.829
(Su Geun secretly calls JR.)

332
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:14.089
- JR.
- Yes?

333
00:13:14.089 --> 00:13:15.729
Did you ever see me lying to people?

334
00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:16.999
You?

335
00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:19.369
This game is to win the prize.

336
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.170
- Yes.
- I know what you're thinking.

337
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.969
I know that you don't trust me now.

338
00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.770
- Really?
- Am I wrong?

339
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.770
That's not true.

340
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:26.910
I don't have any thoughts
at the moment.

341
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.040
You don't trust me, do you?

342
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.780
Su Geun, I'm the Angel though.

343
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.940
I am the Angel.

344
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.680
That's why you are not the Angel.

345
00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:36.650
I am the Angel.

346
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.920
What are you talking about?

347
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.920
I am the Angel.

348
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.390
- He's driving me crazy.
- I'm telling you.

349
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.489
- Hey.
- I am the Angel.

350
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.489
I beg you.

351
00:13:44.489 --> 00:13:46.530
Stop it now.

352
00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:48.329
You have to vote for me.

353
00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:50.900
Everyone can get the prize.

354
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.969
I am telling you.

355
00:13:52.969 --> 00:13:55.739
You have to trust me.

356
00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:57.200
- JR.
- Su Geun.

357
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.209
I'm doing this so that
you can also win the prize.

358
00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:03.040
(They both ask each other
to trust each other.)

359
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.109
If I am the Angel,
it's better to receive many votes.

360
00:14:06.109 --> 00:14:08.879
If I am the Angel...
I am the Angel actually.

361
00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:10.619
If I am the Angel...

362
00:14:10.619 --> 00:14:11.749
- I don't think you are.
- Okay.

363
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:12.790
All right.

364
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.719
That's why you have to vote for me.

365
00:14:15.089 --> 00:14:16.259
Why? Is it because you are Demon?

366
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.219
If you vote for Demon...

367
00:14:18.219 --> 00:14:21.489
- This is so unfair.
- If three of us vote for her,

368
00:14:21.489 --> 00:14:22.700
she will take the prize.

369
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.700
- We won't get any prize, right?
- Of course, we won't.

370
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.999
I find this situation quite unfair.

371
00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:29.440
I am telling people that
I'm the Angel.

372
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.339
Demon and a random player
must tell others that they're Angel.

373
00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:32.540
Everyone wants to be the Angel.

374
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.009
If Demon takes the prize,

375
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:35.709
no one will have the prize.

376
00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.239
- Just do as I say.
- I am the Angel though.

377
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.310
(Min Ho keeps telling people
that he's the Angel.)

378
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.509
He's driving me crazy.

379
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.280
Only Angels can enter.

380
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.719
I am the Angel.

381
00:14:46.089 --> 00:14:47.849
I can't say anything back to her.

382
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.890
I can't say anything back to her.

383
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.660
You have to look closely to those...

384
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.829
who stays quiet during the show.

385
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:58.329
Daniel is really good at
controlling his facial expression.

386
00:14:58.329 --> 00:15:00.530
- Yes. I am.
- He is not the Angel.

387
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.200
- Jin Young is the Angel I think.
- Why?

388
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.400
I think you are the one.

389
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.709
Everyone is trying so hard
from the beginning.

390
00:15:06.709 --> 00:15:07.770
I can't trust anyone.

391
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.540
I think he will do well
even if he was the Angel.

392
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.050
I am just scared that
he might be acting too.

393
00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.680
- He's the Demon.
- He is.

394
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.749
Is he?

395
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.719
- What about you, Chan Yeol?
- I won't say anything.

396
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.119
Why won't you say anything?

397
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.050
I want to just watch others for now.

398
00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.160
You have to tell others
if you are the Angel.

399
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.589
- That way...
- Everyone is saying that...

400
00:15:25.589 --> 00:15:26.989
they are the Angel. And that makes
it hard for me to trust.

401
00:15:26.989 --> 00:15:29.499
Everyone is confusing each other.

402
00:15:29.499 --> 00:15:32.729
I can give everything to prove
that you guys are not the Angel.

403
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.829
I am the Angel.

404
00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:36.339
Sana, why are you lying?

405
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.070
Sana says that she's the Angel.

406
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.009
Min Ho, what did you see on the
screen?

407
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.310
It said,
"Your key is Angel's Master Key."

408
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.079
- What did it say?
- "Angel's Master Key".

409
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.910
Angel's Master Key.

410
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.979
(Whatever)

411
00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:51.180
- What did he say?
- He said "Angel's Master Key".

412
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.249
(He doesn't sound too reliable.)

413
00:15:52.249 --> 00:15:53.619
He doesn't know what the
screen actually says.

414
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.560
"Your key is Angel's Master Key."

415
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.959
"Your key is Angel's Master Key"?

416
00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:00.530
No.
It says, "You are the Angel."

417
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:01.989
- I don't remember well.
- Excuse me.

418
00:16:01.989 --> 00:16:04.560
You are also not the Angel.

419
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:06.229
What about X then?

420
00:16:06.229 --> 00:16:07.499
It just shows X on the screen.

421
00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:09.800
- Does it show an X on the screen?
- Yes.

422
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.839
That's what you saw on your screen.
You were just surprised.

423
00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:13.109
That was written on your screen.

424
00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:14.369
I didn't know it.

425
00:16:14.369 --> 00:16:16.579
- Min Ho looks so surprised.
- That's what your screen showed.

426
00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:18.310
That's what your screen showed.

427
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.379
- I shouldn't say anything.
- I am the Angel though.

428
00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:22.249
We already know that you're lying.

429
00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:23.520
- Just watch me.
- I think...

430
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.249
- "Just watch me."
- He answered so awkwardly.

431
00:16:26.349 --> 00:16:27.820
There are three Angels now.

432
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.459
(These 3 friends came out
from the room secretly.)

433
00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:30.520
All right.

434
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.030
We can tell each other, right?

435
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.089
- I think so.
- I think so too.

436
00:16:35.089 --> 00:16:37.430
- I think Su Geun is lying.
- I think so too.

437
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.099
- I don't think he's the Angel.
- I don't know.

438
00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:42.570
What about the female players?

439
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.599
It is very hard to read
those female players.

440
00:16:44.969 --> 00:16:46.739
It is very hard to read them.

441
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.239
So you saw an X on your screen?

442
00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:51.339
(Nodding)

443
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.249
Okay. I will go inside now.

444
00:16:55.109 --> 00:16:57.579
- I will go inside now.
- Okay. Good.

445
00:16:58.619 --> 00:16:59.950
They don't trust me.

446
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.349
- Why don't you guys trust me?
- JR is not the Angel.

447
00:17:02.349 --> 00:17:05.290
- JR said he is not the Angel.
- When did I ever lie to you guys?

448
00:17:05.989 --> 00:17:08.430
(Angel's Master Key and
Demon's Master Key appear.)

449
00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:11.860
If you vote for Angel's Master Key
and open the prize box,

450
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.430
the players who voted for the Angel
receives the prize.

451
00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:18.600
(If they find the Angel's Master
Key, everyone will be happy.)

452
00:17:18.769 --> 00:17:21.370
If you vote for Demon's Master Key,

453
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:25.279
only the Demon will take the prize.

454
00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:27.709
The players who voted for Demon
won't be able to receive the prize.

455
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.819
(They have to be careful of Demon
who lies to players.)

456
00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:35.789
If a random player receives
the most votes,

457
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:38.289
the amount of prize will get bigger
as the number of votes increases.

458
00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:40.330
The random player will take
the whole prize.

459
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:45.630
(That means anyone can win
without Master Keys.)

460
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.499
(Will this harsh Master Key war
end happily?)

461
00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:54.370
I am telling you. I am the Angel.

462
00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.739
Why would I say this
if I was Demon?

463
00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:58.380
But you don't look like Angel.

464
00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.749
She keeps saying that
I don't look like one.

465
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.479
I look so innocent.

466
00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:06.319
You guys will end up voting me.

467
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.090
You guys might lose the game.

468
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.090
- Just be quiet.
- Okay.

469
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.630
I actually hate this game.

470
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.090
It's about winning Gold Chance Card.

471
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.700
A player who received
the most votes from the people...

472
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.100
will give Gold Chance Card.

473
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.729
Gosh. Today...

474
00:18:21.969 --> 00:18:23.069
Today will be a tough one.

475
00:18:23.069 --> 00:18:24.140
Yes, it will be.

476
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.910
We have members
from Exo, Wanna One,

477
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.170
- NU'EST, and SHINee.
- Last time...

478
00:18:28.269 --> 00:18:30.509
- I'm not sure.
- Min Ho is very popular too.

479
00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:31.680
- I don't know how it will turn out.
- We have a member from Twice too.

480
00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:34.110
- Don't forget Got7 as well.
- Got7. This is great.

481
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:37.880
Which player received
the most votes from the Watchers?

482
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.559
(The Gold Chance Card is at stake.
Which player got the most votes?)

483
00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:44.690
It's Chan Yeol!

484
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.259
(Chan Yeol is chosen!)

485
00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:51.100
From Exo, Baek Hyun was
chosen previously.

486
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.900
Go to the front and choose one.

487
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.969
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

488
00:18:53.969 --> 00:18:56.299
Starting today, we're going
to reveal the Gold Chance Card.

489
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.170
Chan Yeol will get an upper hand
if he's the Demon.

490
00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.769
- That's right.
- If he's not the Demon...

491
00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:01.840
- Read it.
- Or...

492
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.239
"Your vote will count twice."

493
00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:08.009
(It will count 2 times?)

494
00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:10.680
For example, he chose me,

495
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.180
that means I got two votes from him.

496
00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:13.719
So he's a special guy.

497
00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:14.989
- That's a good one.
- There was a similar one.

498
00:19:14.989 --> 00:19:17.759
- This might be either bad...
- Right.

499
00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:18.890
- or good.
- Or it might be good.

500
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.160
- What is it?
- There's something else.

501
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.860
- He can vote for the Demon twice.
- He can vote for the Demon twice.

502
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.299
- That's right.
- So he can take more money.

503
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.029
If you make a wrong guess
and vote for the Demon twice,

504
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:27.029
it won't be good.

505
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:30.239
(What will Chan Yeol's decision be?)

506
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.509
(Gold Chance Card will be either
helpful or disadvantageous.)

507
00:19:34.509 --> 00:19:37.840
(This crucial Card can turn
the table around the game.)

508
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.249
(Can Chan Yeol figure out
who the Angel is?)

509
00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:42.279
- Use it well.
- I will. Thank you.

510
00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:44.950
So what's our first mission?

511
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.719
This is Choose Your Race,
1-on-1 running race.

512
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:49.819
- You will choose one...
- Running race?

513
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.529
You will choose 1 of 2 paper doors,
and go through the chosen door.

514
00:19:52.529 --> 00:19:54.360
You must run your tracks
as fast as you can.

515
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.200
I take that the team with more wins
is going to take the victory.

516
00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.569
You can choose different paper
doors at each section.

517
00:20:01.569 --> 00:20:03.700
Decide the order of your players,
and participate in the races.

518
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.670
The players must take
off their shoes and socks.

519
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.170
When you go through the paper doors,

520
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.180
there are many things that can
throw you off your game.

521
00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.440
- What if there are Lego blocks?
- Imagine you went through the door,

522
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.150
and there's a 20m-deep pit.

523
00:20:13.309 --> 00:20:14.779
- You must run in the basement.
- That's right.

524
00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:16.319
- This is scaring me.
- I'm sure they dug the whole track.

525
00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:18.350
- There will be tacks too.
- Don't be surprised by the dark.

526
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.590
We'll give you a rope,
so you can climb back up.

527
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.420
My observation tells me Su Geun...

528
00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.059
is neither the Angel nor the Demon.

529
00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:26.029
He just feels pressured
to host the show.

530
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:27.360
- He has given up.
- He's just a host.

531
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.400
I presume he's desperate
to do something.

532
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.600
I agree.

533
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.469
Key, you can't say that to me.

534
00:20:32.469 --> 00:20:34.670
You'll be surprised later.

535
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.140
- I'm the best listener here.
- He just gave up.

536
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.269
- You're done.
- Fine, fine.

537
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.969
Let's start the race.
Pick the players.

538
00:20:40.969 --> 00:20:43.209
Sun Bin, you can't choose anyone
because you'll race with me.

539
00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:45.180
I was thinking the same.
I was going to race you.

540
00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:46.950
- I'm serious.
- You're shameless.

541
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.319
- Sun Bin...
- Since you're short, she might win.

542
00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:50.380
I used to run tracks.

543
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.580
So did I.

544
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.120
- I have wings.
- Then you two should compete.

545
00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.690
I bet you'll lose out to Sana.

546
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.559
I'll go against Sana then.

547
00:20:57.559 --> 00:21:00.830
(If I can go against Hyun Moo,
then I'm in luck.)

548
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.559
Gosh, you're cruel.

549
00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:04.799
- I'm a good runner.
- So am I.

550
00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:06.469
- What about you, Chan Yeol?
- Chan Yeol.

551
00:21:06.469 --> 00:21:08.170
- I'll choose Daniel.
- Daniel.

552
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.170
(Chan Yeol picks Daniel.)

553
00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.670
- Have a race with him.
- He's my senior.

554
00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.039
- What about you, Key?
- You're not a good runner, are you?

555
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.940
There are two things I'm bad at.

556
00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.140
They are running
and keeping a poker face.

557
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.809
(He's bad at running
and keeping a poker face.)

558
00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.910
Gosh, he just ruined the whole
suspense. He's something else.

559
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.180
What we should remember is
that speed is important,

560
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.279
but we never know
what lies ahead of us...

561
00:21:25.279 --> 00:21:27.420
- That's right.
- when we go through the doors.

562
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.660
- That sounds scary.
- Speed isn't everything.

563
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.819
All right then. Why don't we start?

564
00:21:31.819 --> 00:21:32.890
Come on!

565
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.330
(Depending on the players, the
difficulty level will be adjusted.)

566
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.299
- Sana, take off your shoes.
- I won't go easy on you.

567
00:21:39.069 --> 00:21:40.069
I'm fast.

568
00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.229
I'm really bad at running.

569
00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:44.969
Hyun Moo.

570
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.539
You're taking off your jacket? You
must be planning to go all out...

571
00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:48.610
against Sana.

572
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.979
- I'm going to win. I'm sorry!
- Unbelievable.

573
00:21:50.979 --> 00:21:53.009
(Sana, let me apologize in advance.)

574
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.279
- Go for it.
- Do you best and get ready.

575
00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:56.279
(Nervousness circles
around the tracks.)

576
00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:57.279
Move to the starting line.

577
00:21:57.719 --> 00:21:58.850
He stopped over.

578
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.350
You can do it.

579
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.059
- Get ready.
- Hold on!

580
00:22:04.019 --> 00:22:05.019
Start!

581
00:22:05.019 --> 00:22:06.660
(The race, Hyun Moo
versus Sana, begins.)

582
00:22:08.259 --> 00:22:10.200
(They run at full speed.)

583
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.630
(To those who desperately
want to win,)

584
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.170
(I'll give you the hurdles.)

585
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.870
(Sana walks on the massage track
since Hyun Moo took Sana's track.)

586
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.940
Sana, take the lead!
Beat him! There you go!

587
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.979
(Good luck. I'm going now.)

588
00:22:22.979 --> 00:22:24.380
Sana, take the lead. That's great!

589
00:22:24.709 --> 00:22:27.350
- Sana, keep running.
- What a fool.

590
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:28.910
(Bye, Hyun Moo.)

591
00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:30.219
- Sana, keep running.
- Keep going straight.

592
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.950
- That's awesome
- Sana.

593
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.350
- The tracks are switched now.
- Good job.

594
00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:35.450
(Screaming)

595
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.390
(You'll get healthy
without realizing it.)

596
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.029
(When you step on this track,
this is the normal reaction to it.)

597
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:47.029
- I bet that hurts.
- He sounds like he's crying.

598
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.200
(Sana is in the lead.)

599
00:22:51.969 --> 00:22:55.209
(She changes the course even though
Hyun Moo is clearly in pain.)

600
00:22:55.209 --> 00:22:57.080
(This time, Sana gets
the massage track.)

601
00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.080
That was great.

602
00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.080
(Is the massage track
easier for Sana?)

603
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.719
(She gently runs
on the massage track.)

604
00:23:03.719 --> 00:23:05.819
Sana! Sana!

605
00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:07.090
- Sana!
- You can hold it.

606
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.590
(Enduring is part of the youth.)

607
00:23:10.259 --> 00:23:11.259
Gosh, why are there so many?

608
00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:13.630
Gosh, why are there so many?

609
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.729
(Hyun Moo struggles
with both tracks.)

610
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.330
We won. This is our win.

611
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.360
(Yes! I won!)

612
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.269
We won. See? I told you
this isn't predictable.

613
00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:21.269
(The 1st round goes to Sana.)

614
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.340
(It seems as if he just
had his triathlon.)

615
00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.309
Sana!

616
00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:29.309
(He lost against her.)

617
00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:30.709
Gosh, the massage track
hurts so much!

618
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.610
Sana!

619
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:35.850
(The score is 0 to 1.)

620
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.180
- Sana is the winner
- She's so cool.

621
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:40.650
I've never won
a running race before.

622
00:23:42.489 --> 00:23:43.890
(It's my first win. Thank you.)

623
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.759
Sana said it's her first time
winning a running race.

624
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.729
(The crew sets up
the obstacles again.)

625
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.229
It's Daniel against Chan Yeol.

626
00:23:50.959 --> 00:23:52.360
This time...

627
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.469
Chan Yeol! Show him what you got!

628
00:23:54.469 --> 00:23:55.870
- You can do it.
- Go for it.

629
00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:57.870
(Their looks are captivating.)

630
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.969
(Is this race really happening?)

631
00:24:03.509 --> 00:24:04.539
You're ready, right?

632
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.049
My internal organs
aren't feeling good.

633
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.279
(Will Daniel of Wanna One win?)

634
00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.309
You're ready, right?

635
00:24:09.009 --> 00:24:11.049
(Or will Chan Yeol, the front man
of Exo, win the race?)

636
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.650
Start!

637
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:13.719
(The race begins.)

638
00:24:14.719 --> 00:24:15.959
Chan Yeol is fast.

639
00:24:15.959 --> 00:24:17.390
(Tingling)

640
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.130
Hey, Daniel.

641
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:24.229
- He's too fast.
- Goodness.

642
00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:25.259
He's just walking fast.

643
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.700
(Screaming in pain)

644
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.600
(I have given up on running.)

645
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.140
Daniel isn't running.

646
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.670
(Chan Yeol is skipping the hurdles
without any hesitation.)

647
00:24:34.769 --> 00:24:37.739
(Meanwhile, Daniel is...)

648
00:24:37.739 --> 00:24:39.910
(walking on the massage track
for the 2nd time.)

649
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.150
Goodness!

650
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.309
Seriously. Give me a break.

651
00:24:42.309 --> 00:24:43.380
(He walks in a sensuous manner.)

652
00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.019
Daniel.

653
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:47.590
Hey.

654
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.559
- Poor him.
- Hey, Daniel.

655
00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:51.489
(Pride of Exo)

656
00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:52.559
Poor Daniel.

657
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.630
(What will Chan Yeol's
third section?)

658
00:24:55.229 --> 00:24:56.229
Oh, no.

659
00:24:56.959 --> 00:24:58.559
(I have no choice
but to walk on it.)

660
00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:00.600
- I guess that really hurts.
- Catch up to him! Go after him!

661
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.900
He might not be able to catch up.

662
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.940
(If he gets hurdles, he has a shot.)

663
00:25:03.569 --> 00:25:06.110
- He can catch up.
- Gosh, this hurts so much.

664
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.709
I guess they can't walk
fast on that track.

665
00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:09.039
(This is my chance.)

666
00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:10.440
No one can walk fast on it.

667
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.910
(However, Chan Yeol gets
the last hurdles.)

668
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.380
I guess hurdles are better
than massage tracks.

669
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.150
(What awaits Daniel is...)

670
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.850
(the unlucky massage track.)

671
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.459
(I'm sorry, but...)

672
00:25:25.459 --> 00:25:27.759
- We lost. We definitely lost.
- This is fun. It's so much fun.

673
00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:29.130
Chan Yeol is good at skipping
the hurdles.

674
00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.299
(Chan Yeol advances with full force
after he regains his pace.)

675
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.200
Chan Yeol wins! Yes!

676
00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:38.440
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

677
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.309
Why are you walking?

678
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.039
(He finishes the race
with a struggle.)

679
00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.840
I guess you're not good at walking
on the massage track.

680
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.209
(The score is 1 to 1.)

681
00:25:46.209 --> 00:25:48.209
- It really hurts.
- It does indeed.

682
00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:53.019
(The man of the hour
on the massage track is me!)

683
00:25:53.019 --> 00:25:56.459
(And the man of the hour on the next
massage track is me again.)

684
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.989
Seriously. Give me a break.

685
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:03.229
(Daniel was chosen 3 times
by the massage track.)

686
00:26:05.529 --> 00:26:07.200
Hey, you look rosy after walking
on the massage tracks.

687
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.100
My internal organs aren't
in good condition.

688
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.170
(His internal organs' health
just improved.)

689
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.840
(After Jin Young bags a win,
Team Hyun Moo is leading.)

690
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.140
I have a feeling you're
good at running.

691
00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:18.739
(Su Geun shows off his fancy steps.)

692
00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:22.580
(Did he just discover
an unexpected talent?)

693
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.319
Hey, should we walk like this
on the massage track?

694
00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:26.450
- We should walk sideways.
- Sideways?

695
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.519
- Yes.
- Just like this?

696
00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:28.650
You have to walk sideways then.

697
00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.289
Are you game or not?

698
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:31.519
- I'm game.
- I'm in too.

699
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:33.989
(Meanwhile, on the other side...)

700
00:26:33.989 --> 00:26:35.130
Gosh, I'm hungry.

701
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.160
Chan Yeol, aren't you the Demon?

702
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.600
I think either you or Henry
is the Demon.

703
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.799
(Angel and Demon haven't
been revealed.)

704
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.900
(What if he's the Demon?)

705
00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.900
I won't tell you.

706
00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.840
Are you the Angel?

707
00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.680
(He puts on a mysterious smile.)

708
00:26:50.739 --> 00:26:52.450
- He answers with actions.
- I won't tell you.

709
00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.080
What about you, Daniel?
Are you the Demon?

710
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.549
I can't tell you now.

711
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.680
Then when will you tell me?
After the shoot ends?

712
00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.420
- You keep saying that.
- Not now.

713
00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.489
(Aren't you being too secretive?)

714
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.130
- Ready.
- Will you say, "start" or count?

715
00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:07.890
Ready, set...

716
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.959
(Regardless, Su Geun's
challenge continues.)

717
00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.130
Start!

718
00:27:10.299 --> 00:27:11.400
- She's fast.
- Gosh, she's fast.

719
00:27:11.559 --> 00:27:12.630
Start!

720
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.170
- She's fast.
- Gosh, she's fast.

721
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.630
(Sun Bin takes Su Geun's track.)

722
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.469
(What should I do?)

723
00:27:20.509 --> 00:27:23.039
- Sweet! Nice!
- Oh, no! What should I do?

724
00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:27.650
- That must hurt.
- Sweet! Nice!

725
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.620
(What will Su Geun's decision be?)

726
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:32.650
(Bravo!)

727
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.989
(I got the massage track again.)

728
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.660
(In pain)

729
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:41.660
What is it?

730
00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.630
- They're not fighting, right?
- How am I supposed to walk on this?

731
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.759
I think they might be fighting.

732
00:27:44.959 --> 00:27:46.299
How am I supposed to walk on this?

733
00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.630
(Laughing)

734
00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:52.739
(She's in despair.)

735
00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:55.809
Goodness!

736
00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:59.850
- Su Geun only got hurdles.
- He's good.

737
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.180
(He got the hurdles
3 times in a row.)

738
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.920
(Su Geun, the lucky guy)

739
00:28:03.719 --> 00:28:05.180
Goodness, look at that old man.

740
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.090
(The problem lies in his strength.)

741
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.650
- Goodness!
- What if Sun Bin wins?

742
00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.690
(As his strength dries up,
his luck does the same.)

743
00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:11.920
Su Geun!

744
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.789
(His strength begins to disappear.)

745
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:15.860
(It's time!)

746
00:28:17.259 --> 00:28:18.330
(Her last chance to take the lead)

747
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.330
No, no!

748
00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.170
- He's taking his sweet time!
- Sun Bin!

749
00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.999
(The distance between is
drastically decreasing.)

750
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.640
No, no!

751
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:28.469
Sun Bin!

752
00:28:28.469 --> 00:28:30.610
(Will Sun Bin be able to catch
up to Su Geun?)

753
00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:31.840
Sun Bin!

754
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.080
I think we're going to lose.

755
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.120
(Sun Bin skipped
over the last hurdle.)

756
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.249
(They are only a few steps away
from the finish line.)

757
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:45.830
(Which one of them will cross
the finish line first?)

758
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.930
(Sun Bin crosses
the finish line first.)

759
00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.299
Sun Bin wins!

760
00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:55.900
No, that's not it.

761
00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.670
Hey, look.

762
00:28:58.039 --> 00:29:00.370
Sun Bin crosses the white line
over there before you.

763
00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:01.670
- It wasn't the flag.
- No, it wasn't.

764
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.140
- You took your time at the end.
- Put that back.

765
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.580
Hey, run sideways and see
if I was taking my time or not.

766
00:29:07.249 --> 00:29:10.319
Su Geun struggled skipping hurdles
because he has short legs.

767
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:11.779
Sun Bin is good at running.

768
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.150
No.

769
00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.019
(I already used up half
of the calories for the day.)

770
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.259
Start!

771
00:29:16.259 --> 00:29:17.719
(The race, JR versus Henry, begins.)

772
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.200
(Welcome. This is your first time
on the massage track, isn't it?)

773
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.200
JR! JR! Start running.

774
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.200
JR.

775
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.969
JR, you must run!

776
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:33.209
(JR wins the race quite easily.)

777
00:29:36.479 --> 00:29:37.979
- That was cool.
- Good job, JR.

778
00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.749
- His ears are red.
- What's the score now?

779
00:29:39.749 --> 00:29:41.910
- It's 3 to 2.
- We're winning.

780
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.080
- One more point. Who's last?
- Is it 4 to 2?

781
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.150
(Who are the last players that
will determine the victory?)

782
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.319
(It's Key of SHINee versus
Seong Wu of Wanna One.)

783
00:29:51.759 --> 00:29:53.489
I'm really horrible at running.

784
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.860
I'm bad at it too.

785
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.559
You said you were good
at it earlier.

786
00:29:57.059 --> 00:29:59.900
All I've been doing is
singing and dancing.

787
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.799
I don't have the slightest
talent in sports.

788
00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:05.940
Not at all.

789
00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.170
Key, go for it!

790
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.340
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

791
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.080
Key, make sure you win! That's
how we'll go to the final.

792
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:16.019
I might lose.
Don't get your hopes up.

793
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.580
I'll be funny.

794
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.219
- Key! Key!
- Seong Wu! Seong Wu!

795
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.529
- Key! Key!
- Seong Wu! Seong Wu!

796
00:30:26.529 --> 00:30:30.059
(On the last round,
the Key Guide is at stake.)

797
00:30:31.259 --> 00:30:32.430
What? What is it?

798
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.600
(Key claims he's bad at sports,
and Seong Wu seems athletic.)

799
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.200
(The result may be obvious.)

800
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.239
Start!

801
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.739
(The race, Key versus
Seong Wu, begins.)

802
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:43.640
(Key, who's not athletic, gets
the hurdles in his first track.)

803
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.809
This hurts so much!

804
00:30:46.709 --> 00:30:48.680
(Look at him.
Didn't he say he can't run?)

805
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:53.390
(Key chooses the hurdles again.)

806
00:30:53.989 --> 00:30:55.489
(Seong Wu gets
the massage track again.)

807
00:30:55.489 --> 00:30:56.719
Oh, my. This hurts a lot.

808
00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:59.459
(At this rate,
I have a shot at winning.)

809
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.900
- Key, hurry! Run!
- Seong Wu!

810
00:31:03.499 --> 00:31:05.430
- Key! Key!
- Ong! Ong!

811
00:31:05.529 --> 00:31:07.600
Hey, Seong Wu isn't good at running.

812
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.900
(I'm going to turn
the table around.)

813
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.440
(Please let me have
the hurdles this time.)

814
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.640
(He's getting
his 3rd massage in a row.)

815
00:31:19.749 --> 00:31:21.549
- My feet hurt so much.
- Key!

816
00:31:21.749 --> 00:31:24.080
- Key! Key!
- Hurry, Key! Run faster!

817
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.350
- Go, Key!
- Go, Key!

818
00:31:26.489 --> 00:31:28.549
- Key!
- Seong Wu isn't good at running.

819
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:29.719
(Only one track remains.)

820
00:31:29.719 --> 00:31:31.860
Hey, Seong Wu can't run.

821
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.930
- What's going on?
- Key!

822
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:33.930
(Which track did Key choose?)

823
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:38.160
- Key! Key!
- Seong Wu isn't good at running.

824
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.430
- Key.
- This is amazing.

825
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.999
- Keep running, Key!
- Gosh, what's going on?

826
00:31:42.969 --> 00:31:46.910
(He's truly the luckiest.
He chose hurdles for all 4 tracks.)

827
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.309
(And he's the icon of bad luck.)

828
00:31:50.309 --> 00:31:52.850
Gosh, this hurts so much!

829
00:31:55.249 --> 00:31:57.880
- Start working out from today.
- Poor you. You're fine.

830
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:59.890
- Okay.
- This really hurts.

831
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.090
Are we tied then?

832
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.090
Yes, we are.

833
00:32:02.459 --> 00:32:04.719
- It's really painful.
- The score is even.

834
00:32:04.719 --> 00:32:06.289
You're fine.

835
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:08.090
- I guess it really hurts.
- Okay.

836
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.499
- Are we tied?
- Yes, we are.

837
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.529
Since it's 3 to 3,
let's have the final race.

838
00:32:13.529 --> 00:32:15.969
- Our team's best player is...
- Who's your best player?

839
00:32:16.499 --> 00:32:17.900
- Key.
- Should he play one more time?

840
00:32:17.999 --> 00:32:19.569
- Key!
- Key!

841
00:32:19.569 --> 00:32:21.709
- No, no.
- Key! Key!

842
00:32:21.709 --> 00:32:23.640
- Key.
- Who won in our team?

843
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.539
- Key!
- Key!

844
00:32:25.539 --> 00:32:27.410
(You should just do it, Key.)

845
00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:30.719
- Seong Wu can't. Definitely not.
- Should I try?

846
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.289
- Do you want to? Chan Yeol!
- Yes.

847
00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:35.819
Our team's best player is Chan Yeol.

848
00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:37.319
It's Exo versus SHINee.

849
00:32:37.319 --> 00:32:39.160
(A match between SHINee and Exo)

850
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.729
(Which team will
take the first Key Guide?)

851
00:32:44.259 --> 00:32:45.559
Gosh, this is really hard.

852
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.400
Who thought I'd be running
at full speed here?

853
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.269
Hey, drawing a picture with pens
is so much easier.

854
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:56.140
I can't believe I'm running.

855
00:32:59.549 --> 00:33:02.209
Getting smacked with whipped cream
is easy. I don't do anything for it.

856
00:33:02.249 --> 00:33:03.319
I guess you're right.

857
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.319
Running?

858
00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:08.890
Key! You can do this, Key!

859
00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:12.590
- Chan Yeol! Chan Yeol!
- Chan Yeol! Chan Yeol!

860
00:33:12.759 --> 00:33:15.259
- Key! Key!
- Chan Yeol!

861
00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:17.259
- Key!
- Are we doing it right?

862
00:33:17.259 --> 00:33:18.259
- Key!
- Chan Yeol!

863
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.569
I hope I choose hurdles.

864
00:33:22.569 --> 00:33:23.969
I hope I choose hurdles too.

865
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:29.039
(It's the last round,
Chan Yeol versus Key.)

866
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:33.979
- Here we go. Key!
- Chan Yeol!

867
00:33:33.979 --> 00:33:36.120
(Breaking through the doors)

868
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:40.190
(He runs at full speed
on the massage track.)

869
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.590
(Let's get out of this massage
track as fast as I can.)

870
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.830
Key, just do your best!

871
00:33:46.529 --> 00:33:48.959
(Screaming)

872
00:33:48.959 --> 00:33:50.999
(I can't lose out!)

873
00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.469
Key, just do your best!

874
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:53.930
- Key, you're doing great!
- He's running.

875
00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:56.799
(Chan Yeol gets a boost
in his speed.)

876
00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:04.110
(Despite the massage track,
he runs at full speed again.)

877
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.350
Key, you're doing great!

878
00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.680
- Key.
- No way!

879
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:10.620
(Key is taking the lead only
by a narrow margin.)

880
00:34:12.249 --> 00:34:16.620
(This is a doable. I can catch up.)

881
00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.060
- Hey!
- Keep running!

882
00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.430
- Chan Yeol!
- Run!

883
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:21.560
(Will Chan Yeol win?)

884
00:34:23.129 --> 00:34:25.870
Key, just do your best.
You're doing great!

885
00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:29.569
(Which player will cross
the finish line first?)

886
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.109
It's Chan Yeol!

887
00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.439
(He endured the pain
as he gritted his teeth.)

888
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.279
(Team Hyun Moo wins.)

889
00:34:40.279 --> 00:34:42.779
Growl, growl, growl

890
00:34:42.779 --> 00:34:44.450
- Growl
- He was amazing.

891
00:34:45.819 --> 00:34:47.890
(I gave my all to this race.)

892
00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:49.919
- We won!
- What is it?

893
00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:52.160
- He stepped over the line.
- What are you talking about?

894
00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:54.930
- Chan Yeol.
- You did well.

895
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.660
- I knew it.
- Goodness, Chan Yeol.

896
00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.029
- I did my best though.
- We'll get the Key Guide.

897
00:35:00.469 --> 00:35:01.529
You did a great job.

898
00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.569
- Well done. Excellent work.
- My feet hurt.

899
00:35:03.669 --> 00:35:06.410
All right. Our team will be getting
the first Key Guide, right?

900
00:35:06.669 --> 00:35:08.739
Yes! Team Hyun Moo wins!

901
00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:10.939
(What will they learn about Angel
and Demon Master Key?)

902
00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.850
(They enter the Room of Reason
to choose the Key Guide.)

903
00:35:17.149 --> 00:35:19.350
We're going to read the Key Guide.

904
00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.350
(Team Hyun Moo chooses
the Key Guide.)

905
00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.989
"Six players of the winning team..."

906
00:35:22.989 --> 00:35:25.160
"will each point at one player
of their choice."

907
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.129
"The players can check if the
chosen player has the Master Key..."

908
00:35:28.129 --> 00:35:29.460
"or not by themselves."

909
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.830
(Everyone will check
the information alone.)

910
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:31.930
This is incredible.

911
00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.069
- This is too easy.
- I'll finally have some allies!

912
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:38.100
But we won't know if the Key
is Angel's or Demon's?

913
00:35:38.169 --> 00:35:41.069
We don't know that. We'll only
know if it's a Master Key or not.

914
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:42.410
- That's limited.
- That's hard.

915
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:45.810
But isn't this too good
of a Key Guide from the start?

916
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.910
It's not set in stone that
we'll choose that one.

917
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.219
But you'll choose
the first one, won't you?

918
00:35:51.219 --> 00:35:52.950
- Right. You like it, right?
- Let's go with the first one.

919
00:35:52.989 --> 00:35:55.120
- The first one is the best.
- It is, isn't it?

920
00:35:55.189 --> 00:35:56.719
- I choose the 1st one too.
- Let's go with the 1st one.

921
00:35:56.919 --> 00:35:59.560
All right. I'm going to give
you the Judgement Cabinet.

922
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.290
You don't need to tell me
whom you're choosing.

923
00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.330
There are so many different phones.

924
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.399
(They can text the crew of
the player they suspect the most.)

925
00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:10.370
But we might ask
about the same player.

926
00:36:10.969 --> 00:36:13.210
Write the player you want
to know about.

927
00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.810
Including me? I don't have
to put down my name?

928
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.040
(Why would you type
in your name now?)

929
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.850
- Do whatever you want.
- I need to know who wrote whom.

930
00:36:21.149 --> 00:36:24.350
- Ask if that person has the Key.
- Got it.

931
00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.020
- Don't look. Stop looking.
- Okay.

932
00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:28.989
(He studies the room.)

933
00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.919
(He's not certain.)

934
00:36:31.719 --> 00:36:34.830
(Which players did players
of Team Hyun Moo choose?)

935
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:38.100
(Does Jin Young
have the Master Key?)

936
00:36:38.359 --> 00:36:39.669
This one is very obvious.

937
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.129
(Lee Su Geun)

938
00:36:44.469 --> 00:36:47.339
(Does Su Geun have the Master Key?)

939
00:36:47.339 --> 00:36:52.279
(- Does Su Geun have the Master Key?
- Does Daniel have the Master Key?)

940
00:36:52.279 --> 00:36:55.210
(Does Sana have the Master Key?)

941
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.649
(At this time, a familiar-looking
cameraman appears.)

942
00:36:57.649 --> 00:36:59.120
Could you bring the screen closer?

943
00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.649
(Be careful.)

944
00:37:01.649 --> 00:37:03.890
(Cameraman Su Geun films
him without a heads-up.)

945
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.100
Gosh, that was close.
I could've gotten him.

946
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.660
I bet he didn't notice me.

947
00:37:12.529 --> 00:37:14.799
- He could've read it.
- I was so close.

948
00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.169
I got it.

949
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.939
I got my answer.

950
00:37:19.939 --> 00:37:21.069
(Which player will figure out
the owner of the Key?)

951
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.879
(Jin Young's key is...)

952
00:37:25.239 --> 00:37:29.950
(- Sana's key is...
- Daniel's key is...)

953
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:34.850
(Does anyone among these players
hold the Key?)

954
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.859
(You have a new message.)

955
00:37:37.919 --> 00:37:39.390
(No way!)

956
00:37:39.689 --> 00:37:42.129
(Chan Yeol seems
to be taken aback.)

957
00:37:43.029 --> 00:37:44.700
(Seong Wu also seems surprised.)

958
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.399
Hey, we're close friends, aren't we?

959
00:37:47.799 --> 00:37:50.700
(I see.)

960
00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:54.569
(Chan Yeol, Seong Wu,
and Jin Young chose Su Geun.)

961
00:37:55.669 --> 00:38:01.210
(Su Geun has the Master Key.)

962
00:38:01.509 --> 00:38:06.219
(It's certain Su Geun is
either the Angel or the Demon.)

963
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.689
(Now, they understand
Su Geun's behavior.)

964
00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.890
(Find the angel)

965
00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.600
(This key is a Master Key.)

966
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:22.739
(After receiving the order
of the Master Key,)

967
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.609
(he emphasized that he's Angel.)

968
00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:30.810
(Is that a smile of Angel
to share the prize?)

969
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:37.219
(Or is it Demon's temptation to
take the prize all to himself?)

970
00:38:38.279 --> 00:38:41.290
(Only Su Geun knows.)

971
00:38:42.149 --> 00:38:43.660
Did you get a satisfactory result?

972
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.919
- I did.
- I did.

973
00:38:44.919 --> 00:38:45.930
I did.

974
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.960
Those who are satisfied must've
seen the O for sure.

975
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.399
Right.

976
00:38:50.399 --> 00:38:51.560
(3 people found
1 of the 2 Master Keys.)

977
00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.700
Let's share it between us.

978
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.069
Just to two of us.

979
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.040
(He might tell him the truth
or false.)

980
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.839
Let's go over there.

981
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:01.839
Okay.

982
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:03.810
Then we don't have
anything else to do.

983
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.339
You're not supposed to share it.

984
00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:07.310
You're not supposed to share it.

985
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.509
(The mind game
for the prize begins.)

986
00:39:10.649 --> 00:39:11.850
Are there two rooms?

987
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:15.189
- Since we have more information,
- This way, my team.

988
00:39:15.189 --> 00:39:17.319
- let's share it between us first.
- Come here.

989
00:39:17.319 --> 00:39:19.330
Please don't lie.

990
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:20.359
But...

991
00:39:20.359 --> 00:39:21.930
Let's be honest between us.

992
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.299
Let's be honest please.

993
00:39:23.299 --> 00:39:24.359
Let's start with you, Sun Bin.

994
00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:26.730
I honestly think...

995
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:28.000
- Not Jin Young?
- No.

996
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.600
(Sun Bin says Jin Young is not
the Master Key.)

997
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.899
What did you find?

998
00:39:31.939 --> 00:39:33.839
Su Geun's the one.

999
00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:36.509
What? Su Geun's the one?

1000
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.310
But I think...

1001
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.149
Su Geun's the Demon for sure.

1002
00:39:42.149 --> 00:39:43.649
- Who is?
- Su Geun.

1003
00:39:43.719 --> 00:39:46.649
Did anyone else find the Master Key?

1004
00:39:46.649 --> 00:39:48.149
Did you?

1005
00:39:48.149 --> 00:39:49.160
You won't believe it.

1006
00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.259
Who was it?

1007
00:39:51.259 --> 00:39:52.290
Sana.

1008
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:54.759
(Henry says Sana's the Master Key.)

1009
00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:56.029
Sana too?

1010
00:39:56.029 --> 00:39:59.669
I didn't expect Sana.

1011
00:39:59.669 --> 00:40:02.969
That's why she kept going like this.

1012
00:40:02.969 --> 00:40:05.469
- She avoided talking.
- She kept winking.

1013
00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:06.569
She's hiding something.

1014
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.140
- She's acting lonely.
- Right.

1015
00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.480
Are you saying Su Geun and Sana
are the Master Keys?

1016
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.450
There isn't one in this team.

1017
00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.580
(He doubts.)

1018
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:16.980
I'll be very upset if it turns out
that you're the Demon.

1019
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.350
I'm honest.

1020
00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:21.390
- Don't say it.
- I know it sounds suspicious.

1021
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:22.589
- Is it really?
- It's Sana.

1022
00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:24.960
I wish I can show you it's true.

1023
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.089
(Is he giving false information
to take the prize himself?)

1024
00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:29.100
Wait. Hold on.

1025
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.469
There's no guarantee they picked us.

1026
00:40:32.529 --> 00:40:34.930
They need to find out.

1027
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.370
I've played many tricks.

1028
00:40:37.939 --> 00:40:39.710
They might have picked me.

1029
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.640
- I'm sure they picked him.
- They probably all picked you.

1030
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.239
I'm sure they're surprised too.

1031
00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:44.580
I think they all picked you.

1032
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.680
Of course.

1033
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:47.649
- Let's check first.
- I trust you.

1034
00:40:47.649 --> 00:40:49.750
Why don't you think it could be me?

1035
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.719
Look. What's good if you're
the Demon?

1036
00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.790
You could make people think
you're the Angel,

1037
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:55.819
so you can get more money.

1038
00:40:55.819 --> 00:40:58.160
- That's why you're the Demon.
- So we shouldn't get caught.

1039
00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.160
Look.

1040
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.960
That makes you sound like
you're the Demon.

1041
00:41:02.859 --> 00:41:05.330
You're so fluent in Korean.

1042
00:41:05.799 --> 00:41:07.770
- You're the Demon.
- Don't be like this.

1043
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.239
You can trust me...

1044
00:41:09.299 --> 00:41:10.799
for sure.

1045
00:41:10.799 --> 00:41:13.739
My goodness.

1046
00:41:13.739 --> 00:41:16.739
- Let's be honest between us.
- Let's be honest.

1047
00:41:16.739 --> 00:41:18.279
Who did you see?

1048
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.850
Don't lie.

1049
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.580
I was really amazed.

1050
00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.779
(Who did Hyun Moo see
through the Key Guide?)

1051
00:41:23.779 --> 00:41:24.850
Kang Daniel.

1052
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.850
That's not right.

1053
00:41:27.049 --> 00:41:29.460
You didn't even talk about
Kang Daniel,

1054
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.589
but you got a message on him?

1055
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:33.529
I was actually...

1056
00:41:33.529 --> 00:41:35.489
going to choose Sana,

1057
00:41:35.489 --> 00:41:37.100
(He was going to choose Sana
at first.)

1058
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.270
but then Kang Daniel winked at me.

1059
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.529
That looked so suspicious.

1060
00:41:41.529 --> 00:41:43.799
(What does his wink mean?)

1061
00:41:43.799 --> 00:41:45.600
We should trust each other.

1062
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.439
First, tell me what you got.

1063
00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:49.739
What did you get?

1064
00:41:49.739 --> 00:41:50.939
- Me?
- Yes.

1065
00:41:50.939 --> 00:41:52.040
(What is the result on choosing
Kang Daniel?)

1066
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.810
- Don't try to trick us.
- He's the Master Key.

1067
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.250
(Hyun Moo says Kang Daniel
is the Master Key.)

1068
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:56.520
He's the Master Key.

1069
00:41:57.379 --> 00:41:58.919
Listen to me.

1070
00:41:58.919 --> 00:42:01.719
Isn't it Su Geun and Kang Daniel?

1071
00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:04.089
But Henry said it's Sana.

1072
00:42:04.089 --> 00:42:06.029
I can't trust Henry.

1073
00:42:06.029 --> 00:42:08.989
We must be honest to each other.

1074
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.500
- I know, but why are you lying?
- I'm being honest.

1075
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.529
(He was almost mistaken
he's in their team.)

1076
00:42:13.529 --> 00:42:14.629
- Who are you?
- Pardon?

1077
00:42:14.629 --> 00:42:16.469
What are you doing here?

1078
00:42:16.469 --> 00:42:18.000
It's definitely not Min Ho.

1079
00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:22.040
Did you check me?
Don't say that if you did.

1080
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.239
Did you check him?

1081
00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.509
- He could be lying.
- No.

1082
00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:27.180
Come here for a second.

1083
00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.819
(Me?)

1084
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.950
Wait. Wait.

1085
00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:37.419
Sit down.

1086
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.160
Look.

1087
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.390
(What does Chan Yeol wants to
talk about in secret?)

1088
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:41.830
Let me explain.

1089
00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:43.730
I'm...

1090
00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:46.899
telling you the truth.
We're one team.

1091
00:42:46.899 --> 00:42:49.029
- I'll trust you.
- I'm very naive,

1092
00:42:49.029 --> 00:42:50.540
and I can't lie.

1093
00:42:50.839 --> 00:42:52.969
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Okay.

1094
00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:54.810
First, you picked Jin Young,

1095
00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:56.540
but he's not the Master Key.

1096
00:42:56.939 --> 00:42:58.739
I chose Su Geun,

1097
00:42:58.839 --> 00:43:00.310
and it said he's the one.

1098
00:43:00.649 --> 00:43:03.049
Look. Su Geun is Demon for sure,

1099
00:43:03.049 --> 00:43:05.379
(Chan Yeol says Su Geun
is definitely Demon.)

1100
00:43:06.149 --> 00:43:09.890
so I'm Angel.

1101
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.629
Trust me. I'm Angel.

1102
00:43:12.629 --> 00:43:15.259
I'm telling you the truth
since we're allies.

1103
00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.259
Then...

1104
00:43:16.259 --> 00:43:17.660
I'm honest.

1105
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.100
(Chan Yeol could get two votes.)

1106
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.969
I'm going to vote for myself.

1107
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.600
Including you,

1108
00:43:25.339 --> 00:43:27.270
since you're not the Master Key,

1109
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.739
I'm going to gather one or two
people who're not the Master Key...

1110
00:43:30.739 --> 00:43:32.509
- from now on.
- Okay.

1111
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:36.549
Then you must pick Jin Young...

1112
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:38.049
- because...
- Because he's not it.

1113
00:43:38.049 --> 00:43:39.149
He really isn't.

1114
00:43:39.149 --> 00:43:40.219
(He's planning to open the box
by getting the most votes.)

1115
00:43:40.219 --> 00:43:42.989
(Is Chan Yeol really Angel?)

1116
00:43:43.319 --> 00:43:46.759
(What will happen to Chan Yeol
and Sun Bin's secret alliance?)

1117
00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:53.270
- They're so into it.
- Isn't it Chan Yeol?

1118
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:55.200
There's an entrance.

1119
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.640
I have no idea what's going on.

1120
00:43:57.969 --> 00:43:59.239
I can't tell what kind
of game it is.

1121
00:43:59.239 --> 00:44:01.169
Be quiet. The Angel is in.

1122
00:44:01.169 --> 00:44:02.339
(Angel is here.)

1123
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.609
The Angel is so fat.

1124
00:44:04.839 --> 00:44:09.049
Su Geun never gets tired.

1125
00:44:09.149 --> 00:44:12.279
We don't need to do this
if you trust me.

1126
00:44:12.279 --> 00:44:14.350
- You can just choose me.
- Stop it now.

1127
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:15.719
I'm sick of it.

1128
00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:17.020
(They don't know if Su Geun is
Angel or Demon.)

1129
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.989
For the second game to see
the Key Guide,

1130
00:44:20.989 --> 00:44:23.230
- What is it?
- you have to use a dough.

1131
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.529
From this...

1132
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:28.270
(Knead Dough in a Row)

1133
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.270
(Umbrella)

1134
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:30.640
If it's an umbrella,

1135
00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.870
you have to make an umbrella
when the rail is on,

1136
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.640
and the last person at the line...

1137
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.540
must say the answer is an umbrella.

1138
00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.549
Because it's on a rail,
you must hurry up.

1139
00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:42.250
You have to pass it on.

1140
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.149
If the last person doesn't
answer it right,

1141
00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:47.350
the rest of the team get a penalty.

1142
00:44:47.549 --> 00:44:51.259
It's good to be the last person.

1143
00:44:51.259 --> 00:44:52.390
I'll be the one to answer.

1144
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.660
- I'm really good at answering.
- I'm the best.

1145
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.930
I'm really good.

1146
00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:57.160
I'm really good at it.

1147
00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.230
I'm not good at kneading.

1148
00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.299
(I say yes when everyone says yes.)

1149
00:45:01.299 --> 00:45:03.399
Min Ho, you're in my team.

1150
00:45:03.399 --> 00:45:05.100
What are you doing over there?

1151
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.739
I can be the one to answer.

1152
00:45:06.969 --> 00:45:08.739
Go to your team.

1153
00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.939
- I'm good at kneading.
- I'm sure your team will lose.

1154
00:45:10.939 --> 00:45:12.239
You're blaming each other.

1155
00:45:12.239 --> 00:45:14.310
Look at my team.
Min Ho has a good sense.

1156
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.520
Key's good at making something.

1157
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.989
Sana's good enough to go to
a Fine Arts college.

1158
00:45:20.989 --> 00:45:23.790
That's what we agreed on.

1159
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:24.790
Right?

1160
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:26.660
He's threatening them.

1161
00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.730
JR performs with an artistic sense.

1162
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.060
(JR performs
with an artistic sense.)

1163
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.799
(Okay, fine.
You can be the one to answer.)

1164
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:36.739
You're good at Fine Arts.

1165
00:45:36.739 --> 00:45:38.839
(Is Team Hyun Moo going
to be democratic?)

1166
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:41.140
- I'm good at Fine Arts.
- Okay, then you can knead.

1167
00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.609
- No, no.
- Too late.

1168
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:45.180
- You can knead.
- You have to knead.

1169
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.009
- What just happened?
- What about you?

1170
00:45:47.009 --> 00:45:48.549
I'm good at making.

1171
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:50.120
I'm pretty confident too.

1172
00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.750
What about you, Seong Wu?
Do you feel confident?

1173
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:54.189
- Yes.
- What?

1174
00:45:54.189 --> 00:45:55.759
- Do you feel confident?
- Yes.

1175
00:45:55.759 --> 00:45:57.419
Okay, then I'll be the one
to answer.

1176
00:45:58.259 --> 00:46:00.029
Is something wrong?

1177
00:46:00.029 --> 00:46:01.930
You're all good at kneading.
I'm not.

1178
00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.029
- You'll end up making it.
- Hey.

1179
00:46:04.029 --> 00:46:05.899
- I can't.
- Go take a shower.

1180
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.600
You guys are so dirty.

1181
00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.069
- Go shower.
- He said they're dirty.

1182
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:12.839
My team agreed on me
answering the question.

1183
00:46:12.839 --> 00:46:14.009
(Did we?)

1184
00:46:14.009 --> 00:46:15.040
Hey.

1185
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.239
(Whatever.)

1186
00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:17.609
He's in there.

1187
00:46:17.609 --> 00:46:19.710
(Captain Jun rushed to take
the spot.)

1188
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.750
- You jerk.
- He took the spot.

1189
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:23.879
They said they're good at kneading.

1190
00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.549
They said they are.

1191
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:26.850
Hurry up and play the game.

1192
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.589
Here's the first category.

1193
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:31.859
Fairy tale, movie, and animal.

1194
00:46:31.859 --> 00:46:33.730
This is easy. Get ready.

1195
00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:36.100
Everyone, stretch.

1196
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.529
Stretch your fingers.

1197
00:46:38.799 --> 00:46:39.870
Stretch.

1198
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:44.299
(While Team Hyun Moo's busy
stretching,)

1199
00:46:44.299 --> 00:46:46.509
(Daniel's dough is ready.)

1200
00:46:47.169 --> 00:46:48.810
(He's playing with the dough
wishing the other team good luck.)

1201
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:49.879
Get ready.

1202
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:54.149
(I'm also ready!)

1203
00:46:54.509 --> 00:46:57.020
Ready, set, go. You have to rush.

1204
00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.719
- What's this?
- What?

1205
00:46:59.189 --> 00:47:01.689
(Here's the dough delivery.)

1206
00:47:01.689 --> 00:47:03.960
(What is this monster?)

1207
00:47:04.359 --> 00:47:06.489
Hey. Don't play dirty.

1208
00:47:06.489 --> 00:47:07.660
This is so hard.

1209
00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.000
- You can try.
- I don't know what that is.

1210
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.899
(Someone doesn't know the question.)

1211
00:47:12.899 --> 00:47:15.529
(Someone's having fun.)

1212
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:19.310
(He makes a lump.)

1213
00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:22.779
- What do I do?
- An apple.

1214
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:26.080
- Not yet.
- It's a movie.

1215
00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.549
You got it. He's almost done.

1216
00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:32.489
Oh, I know what it is.

1217
00:47:32.489 --> 00:47:34.390
What is he making?

1218
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:36.489
(I'll give you an apple.)

1219
00:47:36.489 --> 00:47:40.390
(You can make it a poisonous apple.)

1220
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.089
- What's this?
- What is that?

1221
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:46.870
(He crushes...)

1222
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.000
Yes. That's it.

1223
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.339
(the apple.)

1224
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:53.169
(What is he doing?)

1225
00:47:53.169 --> 00:47:56.279
(He decided to make seven dwarfs.)

1226
00:47:56.879 --> 00:47:58.739
Make it big.

1227
00:47:58.739 --> 00:48:00.109
This one's the big one.

1228
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.480
This one is good.

1229
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.049
There are so many.

1230
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.549
Just do it.

1231
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:06.950
What is that?

1232
00:48:07.219 --> 00:48:12.560
(I will add the details.)

1233
00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.029
(Ta-da.)

1234
00:48:16.359 --> 00:48:17.830
You got it.

1235
00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:21.029
(It looks somewhat
like a human being with his touch.)

1236
00:48:21.029 --> 00:48:23.140
(The plating completes art.)

1237
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.169
Wait for the next one.

1238
00:48:24.169 --> 00:48:25.169
(You have a delivery.)

1239
00:48:25.169 --> 00:48:26.609
- Hold on.
- What is that?

1240
00:48:26.609 --> 00:48:28.609
What is that?

1241
00:48:29.839 --> 00:48:30.879
Jun Hyun Moo!

1242
00:48:30.879 --> 00:48:33.009
(Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
entered.)

1243
00:48:33.009 --> 00:48:37.120
(It's worth arguing
if you look at it with love.)

1244
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:39.390
Jun Hyun Moo!

1245
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:42.419
(It's worth trying if he focuses on
the form and the number of pieces.)

1246
00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:47.089
(Will Hyun Moo understand
what his team aimed for?)

1247
00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.029
- What's this?
- You need it.

1248
00:48:50.029 --> 00:48:51.660
2, 1.

1249
00:48:51.899 --> 00:48:53.029
Do I just say the answer?

1250
00:48:53.029 --> 00:48:55.069
(Because time's up,)

1251
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:57.339
(they get cold water.)

1252
00:48:59.509 --> 00:49:02.169
(How could he not see it?)

1253
00:49:02.169 --> 00:49:05.040
- He looks like a baby.
- Time's up.

1254
00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.149
(He's sorry.)

1255
00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:08.109
Why did he change it?

1256
00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:09.219
What is this?

1257
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:10.649
I almost said Jeju Island.

1258
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.120
(Are these islands?)

1259
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.219
What are these?

1260
00:49:14.219 --> 00:49:15.290
Hyun Moo.

1261
00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.989
How many small pieces are there?

1262
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.430
- Seven.
- Then what's the big one?

1263
00:49:20.529 --> 00:49:22.330
Isn't it obvious the big one is
Snow White?

1264
00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.529
Are you saying this is Snow White?

1265
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
It's white.

1266
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
- They're all white.
- They're all white.

1267
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.469
It's obvious.

1268
00:49:31.469 --> 00:49:32.509
(By looking at other team's loss,)

1269
00:49:32.509 --> 00:49:34.009
I can tell what the rule is now.

1270
00:49:34.009 --> 00:49:36.040
We know how to play it now.

1271
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.509
(they get a sense of it.)

1272
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.350
Let's switch over.

1273
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.180
Follow me Team Angel.

1274
00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.680
Angel.

1275
00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.879
Angel.

1276
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:46.790
(Something fell out.)

1277
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:47.790
What's this?

1278
00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:51.120
(He found a shower head.)

1279
00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.189
You got water in there.

1280
00:49:53.759 --> 00:49:55.390
My team won't need towels.

1281
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:56.759
Do you trust me?

1282
00:49:56.759 --> 00:49:57.830
- Yes.
- I trust you.

1283
00:49:57.830 --> 00:49:59.200
Trust me. Let's do this.

1284
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.299
- I trust you.
- I do too.

1285
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:03.399
It was so cold.

1286
00:50:03.399 --> 00:50:04.399
(We'll pay you back the favor.)

1287
00:50:04.399 --> 00:50:05.469
What have they done?

1288
00:50:06.339 --> 00:50:08.509
It was like this
when we first received it.

1289
00:50:08.509 --> 00:50:09.739
- Really?
- Yes.

1290
00:50:09.739 --> 00:50:10.879
Are you ready to get hit by a rock?

1291
00:50:10.879 --> 00:50:11.879
(They're in trouble.)

1292
00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:13.649
Say May

1293
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:15.450
(He's having fun.)

1294
00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.049
Are you ready?

1295
00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:18.450
Here comes the question.

1296
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:19.549
(The theme is "Frozen".)

1297
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:20.549
(It's easier than the Snow White.)

1298
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:22.489
This is so easy.

1299
00:50:23.219 --> 00:50:25.319
This is so easy.

1300
00:50:26.129 --> 00:50:27.230
It's so easy.

1301
00:50:27.359 --> 00:50:28.759
It began.

1302
00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:30.330
Split it into two.

1303
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.000
Split it into two.

1304
00:50:32.259 --> 00:50:33.870
Olaf.

1305
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:34.899
Let's make Olaf.

1306
00:50:34.899 --> 00:50:35.939
(Olaf for "Frozen")

1307
00:50:35.939 --> 00:50:36.969
Olaf.

1308
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.839
(Team Su Geun decided to make Olaf.)

1309
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.669
(Excited, busy, worried, relaxed)

1310
00:50:41.669 --> 00:50:43.839
- It's so easy.
- He adds what he split.

1311
00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.509
(He completes making
the basic form...)

1312
00:50:46.509 --> 00:50:47.750
(calmly.)

1313
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:48.750
- What do I do?
- It's done.

1314
00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.649
(What do I add onto it?)

1315
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:51.750
The nose.

1316
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.589
- Nose?
- The carrot.

1317
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:55.489
The carrot nose and arms.

1318
00:50:55.489 --> 00:50:56.489
(It needs a carrot nose and arms.)

1319
00:50:56.489 --> 00:50:58.020
It's so easy.

1320
00:50:58.219 --> 00:50:59.390
It's an ordinary snowman.

1321
00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:01.730
(This is so easy.)

1322
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:03.259
Olaf has three bodies.

1323
00:51:03.399 --> 00:51:04.700
- Really?
- Yes.

1324
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.969
They need to talk to each other.

1325
00:51:06.469 --> 00:51:07.469
(Olaf has three bodies.)

1326
00:51:07.469 --> 00:51:08.629
It's an ordinary snowman.

1327
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:11.239
- It's an ordinary snowman.
- Make a long face.

1328
00:51:11.239 --> 00:51:12.669
Make a long face.

1329
00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:16.239
(They need to change the 2 body
snowman into 3 bodies.)

1330
00:51:16.439 --> 00:51:18.439
- It's an ordinary snowman.
- Make a long face.

1331
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.450
(Unexpected Christmas)

1332
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:22.919
- Great.
- The eyes.

1333
00:51:22.919 --> 00:51:24.350
It looks like a duck.

1334
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:26.350
That's a duck.

1335
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:27.790
It looks like a duck.

1336
00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:28.950
(A duck that wants to be Olaf
enters.)

1337
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:30.020
It's a duck.

1338
00:51:30.919 --> 00:51:32.629
(They were in rush that two bodied
Olaf with a long face is here...)

1339
00:51:32.629 --> 00:51:34.890
(instead of three bodies.)

1340
00:51:35.689 --> 00:51:38.100
("The Ugly Duckling"
who wants to be Olaf)

1341
00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:40.270
I know!

1342
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:45.469
(Will Su Geun answer it?)

1343
00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:48.939
(Please say Olaf.)

1344
00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.009
A duck!

1345
00:51:50.009 --> 00:51:51.080
(This is definitely a duck.)

1346
00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:54.450
(A sad premonition...)

1347
00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:57.480
(never misses.)

1348
00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:59.350
(Why can't he see it?)

1349
00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:00.350
Oh, it's cold.

1350
00:52:03.689 --> 00:52:06.230
(A passionate dance)

1351
00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.200
Is it a chicken?

1352
00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:10.629
"Frozen".

1353
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:12.700
It's "Frozen"?

1354
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.339
I'm more amazed that it's "Frozen".

1355
00:52:16.669 --> 00:52:17.969
It was so easy.

1356
00:52:17.969 --> 00:52:19.000
(How is this "Frozen"?)

1357
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.140
I'd get it if it's a penguin.

1358
00:52:21.609 --> 00:52:23.040
This isn't "Frozen" at all.

1359
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.779
How can you not see it?

1360
00:52:25.779 --> 00:52:27.279
Anyone can tell that this is Olaf.

1361
00:52:27.279 --> 00:52:29.680
We put so much effort in making it.

1362
00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.620
You told us to trust you.

1363
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.020
Hey, there were seven pieces
for the Seven Dwarfs.

1364
00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.319
Then what is this?

1365
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:37.759
What else can you make
for "Frozen"?

1366
00:52:37.759 --> 00:52:39.020
There wasn't enough time.

1367
00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:41.560
Why didn't you make a snowman
instead?

1368
00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:43.560
(Snowman...)

1369
00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.000
- It is.
- It is a snowman.

1370
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.730
- It's a snowman.
- It's a snowman.

1371
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.569
- What is this?
- Hands.

1372
00:52:48.799 --> 00:52:49.799
Arms.

1373
00:52:49.939 --> 00:52:51.140
What is this?

1374
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.739
- The carrot.
- Olaf's carrot.

1375
00:52:52.739 --> 00:52:53.810
It's Olaf.

1376
00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:54.939
Let's move on.

1377
00:52:54.939 --> 00:52:57.509
(He knows a snowman, but not Olaf.)

1378
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:58.779
What do you want to do?

1379
00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.410
Should we keep going or switch?

1380
00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:02.279
- I'll continue with kneading.
- With kneading.

1381
00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:03.319
Me too.

1382
00:53:03.319 --> 00:53:05.020
I want to rest,
but I don't want to be blamed.

1383
00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:06.250
Okay. Then I'll answer.

1384
00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:07.319
(Thank you, guys.)

1385
00:53:07.489 --> 00:53:09.589
They're weird.
They want to continue with kneading.

1386
00:53:09.859 --> 00:53:11.359
Please don't alter it.

1387
00:53:11.359 --> 00:53:12.989
Don't play dirty.

1388
00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:15.160
There's something we prepared.

1389
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:16.230
Get ready.

1390
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:18.060
We must communicate.

1391
00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:19.330
Set.

1392
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:21.129
(We'll get it this time.)

1393
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:22.439
Go.

1394
00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:24.669
- We need to communicate.
- This is easy.

1395
00:53:24.669 --> 00:53:25.870
Go.

1396
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:27.270
(Fair play, my foot.)

1397
00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.009
This is easy.

1398
00:53:30.009 --> 00:53:31.210
(They're making a shape
of a mermaid.)

1399
00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:33.410
- This is easy.
- We can do it.

1400
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.410
It's easy.

1401
00:53:34.649 --> 00:53:35.980
They got it.

1402
00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.520
They got it.

1403
00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.189
(It's only a dough now,)

1404
00:53:40.189 --> 00:53:42.189
(but with his touch...)

1405
00:53:42.189 --> 00:53:44.089
- It's seaweed.
- I can do this.

1406
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.560
What is that?

1407
00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:48.160
(He made what looks like a mermaid.)

1408
00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.200
I can do this.

1409
00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.469
(It's time for me to make
a princess.)

1410
00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:53.930
This.

1411
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:54.930
(He's full of ideas.)

1412
00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.270
Exaggerate.

1413
00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.770
No.

1414
00:53:58.299 --> 00:54:00.509
- It's the other way.
- Is it?

1415
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:02.739
(A princess maker)

1416
00:54:04.009 --> 00:54:06.750
(He's gone too far.)

1417
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:07.779
Come on.

1418
00:54:08.049 --> 00:54:09.080
What do you expect me to do?

1419
00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.250
(Fine art can be provocative
sometimes.)

1420
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:11.819
I give up. Whatever.

1421
00:54:11.819 --> 00:54:14.350
- Make the arms.
- You do it.

1422
00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:15.790
That's it. The arms.

1423
00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:17.589
- Make long arms.
- Make the arms.

1424
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:19.430
- Make long arms.
- And you know what it is.

1425
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:20.960
Make it sexy.

1426
00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:21.960
(It's finally Seong Wu's turn now.)

1427
00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.930
(The mermaid is missing something.)

1428
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:28.000
(The mermaid needs a tail.)

1429
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.939
- I think it's almost done.
- Why do I get all the blames?

1430
00:54:29.939 --> 00:54:31.339
It's so easy.

1431
00:54:31.799 --> 00:54:34.140
- Don't be like this.
- Why do I get all the blames?

1432
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.140
(The tail gives it off.)

1433
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.879
(He'll get it.)

1434
00:54:37.879 --> 00:54:39.180
It was so easy.

1435
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.250
We'll win.

1436
00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.049
We got this.

1437
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:44.279
(They're satisfied
with their mermaid.)

1438
00:54:44.279 --> 00:54:45.480
It's going in.

1439
00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.089
Please. Just this once.

1440
00:54:48.089 --> 00:54:49.359
(We gave you the mermaid.)

1441
00:54:49.359 --> 00:54:51.160
(Please get it!)

1442
00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.629
Please. Just this once.

1443
00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:53.759
I know!

1444
00:54:58.259 --> 00:55:00.930
(The tail gives it off.)

1445
00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:03.870
(It's all ready.)

1446
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:08.609
(He just needs to say it.)

1447

<font color="#80ffff">[Kocowa Ver] SBS  E04 Master Key</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

1448
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.310
Make it sexy.

1449
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:27.310
(It's finally Seong Wu's turn now.)

1450
00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:30.280
(The mermaid is missing something.)

1451
00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.350
(The mermaid needs a tail.)

1452
00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:35.289
- I think it's almost done.
- Why do I get all the blames?

It's so easy.

It was so easy.

1458
00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:45.600
We'll win.

1459

(They're satisfied

1461

1469
00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:13.959
(He just needs to say it.)

1470
00:56:15.859 --> 00:56:16.930
Mermaid.

1471
00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:21.030
(We did it!)

1472
00:56:23.069 --> 00:56:24.740
(Forming, shaping,)

1473
00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:27.810
(a sensitive touch, the tail details
and the finish)

1474
00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:29.010
Good job.

1475
00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:32.039
If we answer it this time,

1476
00:56:32.039 --> 00:56:33.379
who wins?

1477
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.310
- Was it Sun Bin's idea?
- It was Sun Bin's idea.

1478
00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:38.379
Our dough helped them.

1479
00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.450
(Daniel's dough...)

1480
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:43.419
(helped them.)

1481
00:56:43.419 --> 00:56:44.760
He made the shape for us.

1482
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.019
Right.

1483
00:56:46.419 --> 00:56:47.959
It's you!

1484
00:56:47.959 --> 00:56:48.990
(Poor Daniel)

1485
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:50.459
Are you a spy?

1486
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:53.200
Did he see it coming?

1487
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.870
It was long. It was helpful.

1488
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:55.930
Good job.

1489
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:57.330
Who's idea was it?

1490
00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:00.470
Henry finished it off.

1491
00:57:00.839 --> 00:57:02.470
- Henry.
- What did he do?

1492
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.410
- Don't be like this.
- Henry.

1493
00:57:04.879 --> 00:57:06.510
- That gave it off.
- Really?

1494
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:08.450
Your touch was weird.

1495
00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:10.379
How was it weird?

1496
00:57:10.379 --> 00:57:11.979
How else do I make it?

1497
00:57:12.149 --> 00:57:16.149
If we answer it this time,
it's a tie.

1498
00:57:16.149 --> 00:57:17.450
Right.

1499
00:57:18.089 --> 00:57:19.220
It's the same category.

1500
00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.189
- Okay.
- Wait.

1501
00:57:21.189 --> 00:57:23.589
- An animal in a children's movie.
- An animal in a children's movie.

1502
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:25.930
- A children's movie?
- I hope it's an animal.

1503
00:57:25.999 --> 00:57:27.260
My goodness.

1504
00:57:27.629 --> 00:57:29.330
- Spread it out.
- Like this.

1505
00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:31.539
- That's good enough.
- Like this.

1506
00:57:31.539 --> 00:57:32.669
What's that?

1507
00:57:33.399 --> 00:57:34.910
It's not cat's cradle.

1508
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:36.910
- Seriously.
- Are you done?

1509
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:38.609
- Is it a spider's web?
- Are you familiar?

1510
00:57:38.609 --> 00:57:39.839
- Gosh.
- It's from a movie.

1511
00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:42.450
- Can we trust you this time?
- It's a parasite.

1512
00:57:42.479 --> 00:57:44.080
Can we trust you this time?

1513
00:57:44.879 --> 00:57:46.680
He's ready.

1514
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.950
(Is he worth trusting or not?)

1515
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:50.019
Get ready.

1516
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.419
(It's Team Su Geun's last chance.)

1517
00:57:52.419 --> 00:57:53.990
I bet it'll be difficult.

1518
00:57:55.189 --> 00:57:56.990
Get ready, set, go.

1519
00:57:57.689 --> 00:57:59.660
- What should we do?
- It's very easy.

1520
00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.729
(It's their keyword
of highest difficulty.)

1521
00:58:01.769 --> 00:58:02.830
What can we do with that?

1522
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:05.240
Come on, it's too easy.

1523
00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:07.700
- No way. It's too easy.
- You can't lift it.

1524
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.870
- You shouldn't lift it.
- What should I do?

1525
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:11.379
- You must communicate.
- How about this finger?

1526
00:58:11.379 --> 00:58:13.280
- It's already shaped.
- How about this shape?

1527
00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.550
- How about this shape?
- It's already shaped.

1528
00:58:15.609 --> 00:58:17.780
- How about this?
- It's already shaped.

1529
00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.789
(Min Ho makes something similar
to a spider shape.)

1530
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:25.519
(We need to add something else.)

1531
00:58:25.959 --> 00:58:27.289
That's all we need.

1532
00:58:27.289 --> 00:58:30.229
(The difference between
a man and Spider Man)

1533
00:58:30.459 --> 00:58:32.499
Gosh, it's too easy.

1534
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.229
Look at that.

1535
00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.100
That's a good idea.

1536
00:58:40.169 --> 00:58:42.039
- It's more similar.
- Goodness.

1537
00:58:42.569 --> 00:58:45.180
- It's getting dangerous.
- Are you doing well?

1538
00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.910
What's with the facial expression?

1539
00:58:47.039 --> 00:58:49.810
- I'm worried.
- They're so good.

1540
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:51.519
It's difficult after all.

1541
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:54.379
- They're so good.
- It's difficult after all.

1542
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:56.819
- She ruined it.
- Stop it.

1543
00:58:57.019 --> 00:58:58.890
- That's good.
- Is it a tadpole?

1544
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.129
- It's good.
- Excuse me.

1545
00:59:02.189 --> 00:59:04.289
- Is it a tadpole?
- Do this.

1546
00:59:04.399 --> 00:59:07.129
- It looks good.
- It's impossible to guess wrong.

1547
00:59:07.129 --> 00:59:09.600
- It's a drunk person in Gangnam.
- Wake up.

1548
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.970
It's someone drunk. There are many
during New Year's.

1549
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:14.609
- He's completely drunk.
- Right.

1550
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:17.069
- It's done.
- He threw up.

1551
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:21.609
(We did our best.
Please guess the right answer.)

1552
00:59:21.649 --> 00:59:23.749
- Will he guess right?
- He threw up?

1553
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.149
I know the answer.

1554
00:59:26.149 --> 00:59:29.050
(He shouts confidently.)

1555
00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:30.890
(Its lying down pose)

1556
00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.930
I know the answer.

1557
00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:41.229
(He won't guess wrong again.)

1558
00:59:41.229 --> 00:59:47.539
(Will he recognize their intention
behind their creation?)

1559
00:59:47.539 --> 00:59:48.609
"Superman".

1560
00:59:49.539 --> 00:59:50.609
"Superman".

1561
00:59:50.609 --> 00:59:53.310
(How could he get this wrong?)

1562
00:59:53.839 --> 00:59:54.879
"Superman".

1563
00:59:57.010 --> 01:00:02.720
(Water falls on them
thanks to their team leader.)

1564
01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.319
(They want to cry.)

1565
01:00:06.319 --> 01:00:07.419
Is it wrong?

1566
01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:09.890
Come on.

1567
01:00:10.229 --> 01:00:12.129
- Goodness.
- "Spiderman".

1568
01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:13.930
What?

1569
01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.069
You aren't observant at all.

1570
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:18.569
- They made spider webs.
- I didn't see them.

1571
01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.839
- I resent him.
- On the hands,

1572
01:00:20.839 --> 01:00:22.140
she added some detail.

1573
01:00:22.269 --> 01:00:25.039
Gosh, I didn't see them.

1574
01:00:25.339 --> 01:00:27.280
Team Hyun Moo wins.

1575
01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.680
(Team Hyun Moo wins
the second mission.)

1576
01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:31.050
We lost again.

1577
01:00:31.479 --> 01:00:34.249
Listen, everyone. I'm really sorry.

1578
01:00:34.519 --> 01:00:37.419
I gave you useful information
that I'm the Angel.

1579
01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.490
(She can't believe her ears.)

1580
01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:40.919
I'm the Angel.

1581
01:00:40.919 --> 01:00:42.990
I'm the Angel.

1582
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:44.129
- Stop lying.
- I'm...

1583
01:00:44.129 --> 01:00:46.459
Please stop it. I'm the Angel.

1584
01:00:46.459 --> 01:00:49.129
- It's me.
- I gave you useful information.

1585
01:00:49.129 --> 01:00:51.370
I've never seen her this angry.

1586
01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:56.109
(He insists that everyone is Angel.
What is he?)

1587
01:00:57.609 --> 01:00:59.839
Why do they think that about me?

1588
01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:03.310
This is not even...

1589
01:01:04.249 --> 01:01:06.180
worth listening to.

1590
01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:07.789
I'm the Angel.

1591
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:09.950
(His voice echoes into
an empty space.)

1592
01:01:11.419 --> 01:01:14.430
(Get people's votes.)

1593
01:01:15.959 --> 01:01:18.760
(He's confused while eating.)

1594
01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:20.800
I'm the Angel.

1595
01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:23.069
I'm serious.

1596
01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.899
- What about Su Geun?
- I don't know.

1597
01:01:26.539 --> 01:01:28.370
We never verified it.

1598
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:31.780
He seems like Demon.
Give me a chance to prove it.

1599
01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:35.450
I'll find out when
I take my next chance.

1600
01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:36.510
- Really?
- Yes.

1601
01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:39.620
If it's true, I'll support you...

1602
01:01:40.019 --> 01:01:41.390
- Really?
- fully.

1603
01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:43.550
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

1604
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.990
Thank you for supporting me.

1605
01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.930
(I trust you, Seong Wu.)

1606
01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:50.089
Good luck.

1607
01:01:50.689 --> 01:01:51.930
- Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

1608
01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:55.800
(It's hard to earn votes.)

1609
01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.999
Being Angel is so lonely.

1610
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:01.109
I'm the Angel.

1611
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:02.510
(He tries to persuade Daniel.)

1612
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.539
Seriously. I don't want to be pushy.

1613
01:02:04.539 --> 01:02:06.379
- It's been unfair.
- Is that so?

1614
01:02:07.439 --> 01:02:10.649
If you vote for me,
both of us will be happy.

1615
01:02:10.979 --> 01:02:12.919
Everyone looks down on me,

1616
01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:15.890
but all of you will be surprised.

1617
01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.760
Seriously.

1618
01:02:20.019 --> 01:02:22.629
- I feel like a fool.
- Then I'm an Angel.

1619
01:02:22.629 --> 01:02:25.560
Give me a chance to prove myself.
I'm not asking you to vote.

1620
01:02:25.899 --> 01:02:28.370
Give me a chance...

1621
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:30.370
to prove myself.

1622
01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:31.839
- Has it been unfair?
- Yes.

1623
01:02:31.899 --> 01:02:33.999
Won't you be embarrassed
when the show gets aired?

1624
01:02:33.999 --> 01:02:35.640
Stop lying.

1625
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.609
- What should I do?
- I really...

1626
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.010
don't want to ask this.

1627
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.080
I'll bring it up next time
when we take a chance.

1628
01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.819
It's so difficult.
No one believes me.

1629
01:02:50.019 --> 01:02:51.120
I'll bring it up.

1630
01:02:51.359 --> 01:02:52.419
Trust me.

1631
01:02:52.859 --> 01:02:54.990
It's harder than
"Show Me The Money".

1632
01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:59.399
(Being Angel is harder than rap.)

1633
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:02.399
Gosh, it's so frustrating.

1634
01:03:03.729 --> 01:03:07.069
(Will Min Ho prove himself?)

1635
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:11.280
- What should we do?
- We must choose wisely.

1636
01:03:11.709 --> 01:03:15.479
Will we choose
three members to see...

1637
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:19.149
if they have a Master Key?
They can be from our team.

1638
01:03:19.149 --> 01:03:21.589
- This option allows...
- We choose who.

1639
01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:23.819
- Only one person can find out.
- only the team leader to find out.

1640
01:03:24.089 --> 01:03:25.689
However, the team leader can lie.

1641
01:03:25.689 --> 01:03:27.729
- I won't lie. Trust me.
- Jin Young.

1642
01:03:27.729 --> 01:03:30.430
- Jin Young.
- Let's choose three members.

1643
01:03:30.689 --> 01:03:32.030
- Who?
- Who?

1644
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:34.600
- Three members.
- Please pick me.

1645
01:03:35.569 --> 01:03:36.830
Let's pick him.

1646
01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:38.939
- No.
- That's a good idea.

1647
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:40.370
Please pick me.

1648
01:03:42.939 --> 01:03:44.640
(Let's see.)

1649
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:51.149
(Min Ho wants to prove himself.)

1650
01:03:51.149 --> 01:03:52.419
Give me a chance to prove myself.

1651
01:03:52.419 --> 01:03:54.050
Stop lying.

1652
01:03:56.689 --> 01:03:58.890
(What will Team Hyun Moo decide?)

1653
01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:00.620
Three members that we choose...

1654
01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.459
Who are they?

1655
01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:04.999
Sana.

1656
01:04:04.999 --> 01:04:07.060
(One of them is Sana.)

1657
01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.129
JR.

1658
01:04:08.129 --> 01:04:10.530
(Sana and JR)

1659
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:11.600
- Daniel.
- Okay.

1660
01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.370
(Sana, JR, and Daniel)

1661
01:04:14.709 --> 01:04:16.910
(Wait a minute.)

1662
01:04:17.539 --> 01:04:18.640
(He's speechless.)

1663
01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.839
Listen.

1664
01:04:19.839 --> 01:04:22.080
You don't seem suspicious at all.

1665
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:24.879
It's pointless to choose you.

1666
01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.680
Go to Judgement Cabinet.

1667
01:04:27.249 --> 01:04:29.249
This means that...

1668
01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.160
you don't trust me.

1669
01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.589
You'd better not lie.

1670
01:04:32.959 --> 01:04:34.430
None of them have it.

1671
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:36.229
- I trust you one last time.
- Okay.

1672
01:04:36.359 --> 01:04:37.629
- 1 for Sana.
- 1.

1673
01:04:37.629 --> 01:04:38.899
What if Jin Young is Demon?

1674
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:40.560
- JR.
- JR.

1675
01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:43.169
- I can't look, right?
- Daniel.

1676
01:04:43.169 --> 01:04:44.800
- Let's go.
- We have to stay away.

1677
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.510
(It's time to announce the result.)

1678
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:51.580
Does any of the three
have a Master Key?

1679
01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:56.810
(The answer will
determine their fate.)

1680
01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:03.390
(Everyone looks at Jin Young.)

1681
01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:06.859
(Only Jin Young can see the result.)

1682
01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:11.999
(What's the truth that he'll see?)

1683
01:05:13.399 --> 01:05:17.399
(Neither Sana, JR, nor Daniel
has a Master Key.)

1684
01:05:17.769 --> 01:05:19.439
(He's shocked.)

1685
01:05:19.439 --> 01:05:20.499
I saw the result.

1686
01:05:24.439 --> 01:05:28.109
(Henry suspects Sana.)

1687
01:05:29.879 --> 01:05:33.879
(Hyun Moo suspects Daniel.)

1688
01:05:35.149 --> 01:05:37.760
(Both of them are wrong.)

1689
01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.330
(They don't help the team at all.)

1690
01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.260
(You should have picked me.)

1691
01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.069
- I saw the result.
- You shouldn't lie. Come here.

1692
01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.069
- Is anyone close to him?
- No.

1693
01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:52.200
Can you tell if he's lying?

1694
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.769
- They're watching his lips.
- Tell us later.

1695
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:56.839
- You should hide.
- Hey.

1696
01:05:56.839 --> 01:05:58.810
- He can say what he read,
- Don't.

1697
01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:01.550
- but he could be lying.
- Stop trying to find out.

1698
01:06:01.649 --> 01:06:02.850
Okay.

1699
01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:04.379
- He could tell the truth.
- Pretend you didn't see it.

1700
01:06:04.379 --> 01:06:06.419
It's part of our strategy.

1701
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:10.819
(There is none.)

1702
01:06:11.519 --> 01:06:12.620
(Jin Young tells the truth.)

1703
01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.019
That's shocking.

1704
01:06:14.019 --> 01:06:15.729
My goodness.

1705
01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.030
(4 from Team Su Geun are revealed.)

1706
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:19.459
What should we do? Can we go on?

1707
01:06:19.629 --> 01:06:21.030
Let's continue.

1708
01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:22.729
(Will Team Hyun Moo
get closer to the Angel?)

1709
01:06:24.169 --> 01:06:25.740
- That was right.
- It's pointless.

1710
01:06:26.539 --> 01:06:28.339
- No one has it?
- Sana has no Master Key?

1711
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:30.470
- No.
- Wait, Hyun Moo.

1712
01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:32.780
Can the 4 of us talk for 5 minutes?

1713
01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:34.709
Without me?

1714
01:06:35.479 --> 01:06:36.950
Let us talk for five minutes.

1715
01:06:38.649 --> 01:06:42.890
(Daniel, Sana, and JR don't have
the Master Key.)

1716
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:47.930
(They find out that he was lying.)

1717
01:06:48.089 --> 01:06:49.890
We have a collaboration performance.

1718
01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:51.899
We have work schedule next week.

1719
01:06:52.459 --> 01:06:55.269
- Wait a minute.
- Give us five minutes.

1720
01:06:55.769 --> 01:06:57.970
- You can't do this to me.
- All we have to do...

1721
01:06:58.039 --> 01:07:00.740
- Shall we move away?
- is be honest.

1722
01:07:00.899 --> 01:07:02.839
You weren't honest first.

1723
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:05.810
- Henry wants to exclude you.
- What makes you think that?

1724
01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.910
- Exclude him.
- Let's talk.

1725
01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.609
He seems like a liar.

1726
01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:12.149
I like Jin Young,
so let me talk to him.

1727
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.519
Henry. Chan Yeol.

1728
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:19.160
To be exact,
I have two chances to vote.

1729
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.490
It's a huge advantage.

1730
01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:22.959
- You can vote for yourself.
- Right.

1731
01:07:22.959 --> 01:07:24.160
- You can vote for yourself.
- Can you?

1732
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.330
So I am going to
talk to three people.

1733
01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:30.569
That's already five votes,
including my votes.

1734
01:07:30.569 --> 01:07:33.300
If the votes get spread out there,

1735
01:07:33.339 --> 01:07:34.569
I will have a chance.

1736
01:07:34.569 --> 01:07:38.740
At first, I was going to
reveal that I was the Angel.

1737
01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.609
But everyone claimed
to be an Angel.

1738
01:07:40.839 --> 01:07:43.180
(Chan Yeol might be
telling the truth.)

1739
01:07:43.479 --> 01:07:46.419
Overall, we have the advantage.
And I...

1740
01:07:46.419 --> 01:07:48.550
- There he is.
- Jin Young.

1741
01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.419
You saw an X, didn't you?

1742
01:07:52.019 --> 01:07:55.060
Min Ho told me
he was an Angel too.

1743
01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:57.060
- What?
- You saw an X, didn't you?

1744
01:07:57.689 --> 01:07:58.959
It's me.

1745
01:07:59.399 --> 01:08:01.600
- Anyway, remember what I said.
- Okay.

1746
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.499
Everyone's got an X, right?

1747
01:08:03.499 --> 01:08:04.939
You saw an X here, didn't you?

1748
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:07.339
No. Yours...

1749
01:08:07.339 --> 01:08:08.709
(His words and action don't match.)

1750
01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:10.939
- Yours was an X.
- Look at you.

1751
01:08:11.479 --> 01:08:12.979
I saw an O here.

1752
01:08:12.979 --> 01:08:15.280
- You just saw an X, didn't you?
- I just saw an O.

1753
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.249
I think we're safe here.

1754
01:08:18.249 --> 01:08:20.850
- Anyway, I have two votes.
- Right.

1755
01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:22.919
If just 3 people vote for me,
I will get 5 votes,

1756
01:08:22.919 --> 01:08:25.289
and I will have a big chance
to win.

1757
01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:28.229
Sun Bin and I talked,

1758
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:31.729
and we became certain
that Su Geun is Demon.

1759
01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.100
My plan is...

1760
01:08:33.959 --> 01:08:35.729
to talk to Seong Wu,
Jin Young, and you.

1761
01:08:36.129 --> 01:08:39.800
If I get your votes,

1762
01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.910
I will be able to win nicely.

1763
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.180
Who should I point out
as an angel?

1764
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:48.180
It should be me.

1765
01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.609
- Are you Angel?
- Yes.

1766
01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:53.680
(Is he Angel too?)

1767
01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.319
- But at first, I...
- He could be telling the truth.

1768
01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:57.319
Right.

1769
01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:59.789
Anyway, I have two votes.

1770
01:09:00.419 --> 01:09:02.430
I am in an advantageous position.

1771
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.629
We just have to stay like this.

1772
01:09:04.629 --> 01:09:05.800
What will we do?

1773
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.100
Can't you trust me once?

1774
01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.499
- Just the three of you.
- Isn't it embarrassing to say it?

1775
01:09:10.499 --> 01:09:11.499
No.

1776
01:09:11.499 --> 01:09:14.470
We know. You fool...

1777
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:16.810
(Blonde Angel Min Ho
has entered the room.)

1778
01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:20.680
This team is fun. Everyone
pretends to be an angel.

1779
01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:24.050
Please trust me. Please, Min Ho.

1780
01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.249
Come on, Sana.

1781
01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:27.680
- Check the result.
- We will.

1782
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.789
I won't say more. You...

1783
01:09:34.489 --> 01:09:37.459
- He said he won't say no more.
- I am more confused.

1784
01:09:37.459 --> 01:09:39.529
- I am sorry I am late.
- I told you so many times.

1785
01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.699
Who came later than me?

1786
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:43.499
Mr. Demon.

1787
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:45.570
You are Demon.

1788
01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:48.039
(They both flap their arms.)

1789
01:09:48.039 --> 01:09:49.110
What's this?

1790
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:50.770
- I am flapping my wings.
- He's a bat.

1791
01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.709
Don't you see
the computer-generated wings?

1792
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:54.680
I see a bat. Demon.

1793
01:09:54.779 --> 01:09:55.909
This is the last game, isn't it?

1794
01:09:55.909 --> 01:09:57.510
Everyone wanted to
play this game again.

1795
01:09:57.510 --> 01:10:00.779
Everyone asked
for one more round of it.

1796
01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:02.320
- Do you remember it?
- Yes.

1797
01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:05.289
Even if you get only two letters,
you can shout an answer.

1798
01:10:05.289 --> 01:10:06.390
You can guess it.

1799
01:10:06.419 --> 01:10:10.060
This game is Don't Show Your Back.

1800
01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:13.060
The person who combines
the letters on the opponents'...

1801
01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.470
backs and comes up
with the answer wins.

1802
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:17.529
Each of you has to
be careful not to...

1803
01:10:17.529 --> 01:10:19.339
reveal the letter on your back.

1804
01:10:19.339 --> 01:10:21.140
And you should try to see
the letters on your opponent's back.

1805
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:24.369
If you have a guess, jump
and say the answer. Okay?

1806
01:10:24.369 --> 01:10:25.680
You have to get the mic.

1807
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.239
- Do you understand it, Sana?
- No.

1808
01:10:27.239 --> 01:10:29.379
- Each of us will wear...
- You can't see the back.

1809
01:10:29.379 --> 01:10:30.779
- one letter on our back.
- One letter each.

1810
01:10:30.779 --> 01:10:33.079
And the letters will be combined.
"Anck Su Namum".

1811
01:10:33.079 --> 01:10:35.419
Why would you use
"Anck Su Namum" as an example?

1812
01:10:35.419 --> 01:10:38.360
- That film is so old.
- She's an Egyptian queen.

1813
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.959
Our members are tall.
Our average height is tall.

1814
01:10:40.959 --> 01:10:42.529
- Let's go.
- Cheers.

1815
01:10:42.529 --> 01:10:44.289
What is it?

1816
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.560
- Watch out.
- They can see it.

1817
01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.070
Once they see this letter,
the game is over.

1818
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:49.970
The person who is strong
and who can hide it well...

1819
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:51.440
- should wear this.
- Should I...

1820
01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.699
Should I wear that one?

1821
01:10:52.839 --> 01:10:54.539
Yes. You can handle it, right?

1822
01:10:54.539 --> 01:10:56.369
- Is this an important one?
- It is.

1823
01:10:56.369 --> 01:10:57.980
- You can't let them see it.
- They can't see that.

1824
01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.239
They can't see that.

1825
01:10:59.239 --> 01:11:00.940
I am playing an important role,
right?

1826
01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.709
You are playing an important role.
You can't let them see it.

1827
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:04.249
Yours and Chan Yeol's are crucial.

1828
01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.879
Yes, I am playing an important role.

1829
01:11:05.879 --> 01:11:07.820
Gather up while facing the front.

1830
01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.890
Here's our strategy.
Key will infiltrate into their side.

1831
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:10.890
That's your job.

1832
01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:12.589
They will have no idea anyway.
Your job is to infiltrate.

1833
01:11:12.589 --> 01:11:13.919
You should run forward
as soon as the game begins.

1834
01:11:13.919 --> 01:11:15.989
- I will see everyone's letter.
- Let them see yours.

1835
01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.360
If he does his job well...

1836
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.659
We will be good.

1837
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:21.430
Let's go.

1838
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:22.900
Wait.

1839
01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:23.930
- Wait.
- All right.

1840
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:26.169
We might get hurt
if we play the game right away.

1841
01:11:26.169 --> 01:11:29.209
Why don't we dance first?

1842
01:11:29.409 --> 01:11:31.909
When the song ends,
we can start the game.

1843
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:34.079
Be careful.

1844
01:11:34.279 --> 01:11:36.650
(What just happened?)

1845
01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:40.220
- Be careful.
- Let's dance to the music.

1846
01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.020
Daniel. 1, 2, 3, go.

1847
01:11:46.789 --> 01:11:48.659
(He tries his best
not to show his back.)

1848
01:11:48.659 --> 01:11:51.699
(I won't show it to you.)

1849
01:11:51.699 --> 01:11:53.459
Next.

1850
01:11:53.659 --> 01:11:55.770
(Seong Woo counterattacks.)

1851
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:59.570
(He moves only minimally.)

1852
01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:02.709
Key.

1853
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:06.140
No. Key.

1854
01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.110
I saw it!

1855
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:09.550
(I got you.)

1856
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:10.680
I saw it.

1857
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.480
Who's next?

1858
01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:15.419
(Let me see your back.)

1859
01:12:15.419 --> 01:12:18.659
(While dancing, they try to
see what's on each other's back.)

1860
01:12:22.089 --> 01:12:24.190
(He nearly gave it to them.)

1861
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:26.529
Sana.

1862
01:12:26.999 --> 01:12:30.300
Let's go!

1863
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:32.440
(It's a new kind of dance.)

1864
01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:35.970
(How will we live without Sana?)

1865
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:37.909
Sun Bin, you're up next.

1866
01:12:37.909 --> 01:12:40.010
(Sun Bin enters the stage.)

1867
01:12:41.909 --> 01:12:45.650
(That was a perfect wave.)

1868
01:12:46.619 --> 01:12:47.680
(Round 1 starts.)

1869
01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.720
Let's go.

1870
01:12:49.289 --> 01:12:50.619
Let's go.

1871
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.419
Let's go.

1872
01:12:53.419 --> 01:12:58.129
Go, Key. Attack.

1873
01:12:58.959 --> 01:13:00.459
Attack, Key.

1874
01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:02.070
Watch out.

1875
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:03.270
(He bumps his head on the wall.)

1876
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:04.640
I am sorry.

1877
01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.869
(Is he hurt?)

1878
01:13:05.869 --> 01:13:07.539
(They check his letter.)

1879
01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:10.539
I am sorry.

1880
01:13:10.539 --> 01:13:11.839
("Ja")

1881
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:17.709
- It's "Ja".
- It's "Ja".

1882
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:18.779
Come here.

1883
01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.720
- Whose is it?
- I will show you my skill.

1884
01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:21.989
"Ja".

1885
01:13:21.989 --> 01:13:23.249
(Key attacks for the second time.)

1886
01:13:23.249 --> 01:13:24.249
(Key and Hyun Moo's
back are revealed at the same time.)

1887
01:13:24.249 --> 01:13:26.390
(It's "Gae" and "Ri".)

1888
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:27.989
I saw it.

1889
01:13:27.989 --> 01:13:29.589
It's "Gae".

1890
01:13:29.589 --> 01:13:31.060
- I see it.
- It's "Ri".

1891
01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:34.159
- "Ri".
- "Ja" and "Ri".

1892
01:13:34.159 --> 01:13:36.329
Come here. Whose is it?

1893
01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:38.999
- Whose was it?
- I'll show you my skill.

1894
01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:43.539
(He lies down and slides down
to the other side.)

1895
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:48.980
(He becomes one with the floor.)

1896
01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:51.650
Are you okay?
Can you get up?

1897
01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:53.350
(His letter will be revealed
as soon as he gets up.)

1898
01:13:54.119 --> 01:13:56.020
(He spots a prey.)

1899
01:13:56.249 --> 01:13:57.249
"Gae".

1900
01:13:57.890 --> 01:14:01.930
What are you doing?

1901
01:14:02.129 --> 01:14:03.589
What is he doing?

1902
01:14:03.589 --> 01:14:07.159
What are you doing?

1903
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.129
("Eun")

1904
01:14:09.869 --> 01:14:11.570
"Eun".

1905
01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:13.539
(3 letters from Team Hyun Moo
are revealed.)

1906
01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:15.770
("Pyo")

1907
01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.239
No. No.

1908
01:14:19.239 --> 01:14:21.550
- "Pyo".
- No.

1909
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:24.919
- "Eun", "Ri", "Pyo", "Ja".
- Wait.

1910
01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:26.779
- "Eun", "Ri", "Pyo", "Ja".
- "Eun", "Ri", "Pyo", "Ja"?

1911
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.449
- "Ri".
- "Pyo".

1912
01:14:28.919 --> 01:14:30.949
- Okay.
- No.

1913
01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:32.520
What's that?

1914
01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.119
What's that?

1915
01:14:34.119 --> 01:14:35.430
- What's that?
- What's that?

1916
01:14:35.489 --> 01:14:38.829
(The letter got stuck on the wall.)

1917
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:42.770
(It's "Eum".)

1918
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:45.270
- What's this?
- "Ja" and "Ri".

1919
01:14:45.369 --> 01:14:46.369
"Eum".

1920
01:14:46.369 --> 01:14:48.070
What is it? What's the answer?

1921
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:52.180
I got the answer.

1922
01:14:52.339 --> 01:14:53.610
A treble clef.

1923
01:14:53.610 --> 01:15:00.220
(A treble clef)

1924
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.550
Okay.

1925
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:04.119
Did you see that?

1926
01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.520
A treble clef.

1927
01:15:05.919 --> 01:15:07.119
Okay.

1928
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:11.329
(He revealed the crucial hint.)

1929
01:15:11.629 --> 01:15:13.300
- What's that?
- Did you see that?

1930
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.900
- What was that?
- Show them the letters.

1931
01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:18.470
We will shout the letters loudly.

1932
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:20.169
- We will shout the letters.
- Okay.

1933
01:15:20.169 --> 01:15:22.440
- Then you can guess the answer.
- You and I can guess the answer.

1934
01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.169
You can't be aggressive.

1935
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:26.409
Your letters got revealed
while moving around.

1936
01:15:26.409 --> 01:15:27.610
(The letters for Round 2
are revealed.)

1937
01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:29.709
- Which word has this letter?
- These two...

1938
01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:30.709
It's easy.

1939
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:32.180
- These two should be...
- What's this?

1940
01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.350
given to the people
who are good.

1941
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:34.650
This is important.

1942
01:15:34.650 --> 01:15:36.619
- This is...
- How about you?

1943
01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:37.760
- You should take that word.
- Can you do it?

1944
01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.159
- Should I take it?
- It's important.

1945
01:15:39.159 --> 01:15:41.060
- I never reveal my letter, do I?
- It's easy.

1946
01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:42.829
I just bite their hands.

1947
01:15:42.829 --> 01:15:44.529
You guys can reveal your letters.

1948
01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.430
(Team Hyun Moo's word
is mitochondria.)

1949
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:50.800
- What's this?
- Popcorn.

1950
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:53.300
(Come on, Henry.)

1951
01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.570
What's up with him?

1952
01:15:54.909 --> 01:15:56.810
- It's a different word.
- This is tough.

1953
01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:59.379
I don't know what it is.

1954
01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.579
Good job.

1955
01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.749
(She lies flat on top.)

1956
01:16:04.749 --> 01:16:06.119
(She guards it with her life.)

1957
01:16:06.119 --> 01:16:08.749
Nobody is looking.

1958
01:16:09.619 --> 01:16:10.690
Nobody is looking, Sun Bin.

1959
01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:11.919
That was so desperate.

1960
01:16:11.919 --> 01:16:13.520
- I thought she collapsed.
- She was amazing.

1961
01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.760
You take this one.

1962
01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.489
(She's determined
to guard the letter.)

1963
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.329
We have to dance again.

1964
01:16:19.329 --> 01:16:20.800
Music, please.

1965
01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.329
You know who's
in the infiltration team.

1966
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:25.070
(Yes, sir.)

1967
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:27.810
Should we do a group dance?

1968
01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:30.570
Let's dance together.

1969
01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:35.409
(Chan Yeol dances first,)

1970
01:16:35.409 --> 01:16:37.279
(and JR dances back.)

1971
01:16:37.279 --> 01:16:40.320
I will do it first. Follow me.

1972
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:44.190
1, 2, 3. Follow me.

1973
01:16:44.459 --> 01:16:45.520
Follow me.

1974
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.860
(The techno troop
marches forward.)

1975
01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:51.930
(This is how you
dance in group.)

1976
01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:53.029
Follow me.

1977
01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.730
- Let's do B-boying.
- We can't see anything.

1978
01:16:56.730 --> 01:16:57.940
B-boying.

1979
01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:58.999
He's good.

1980
01:16:59.239 --> 01:17:01.270
(Did you think
I was going to turn back?)

1981
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:02.510
Just tease them.

1982
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:08.980
(Here we go.)

1983
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:11.350
Let's go.

1984
01:17:11.379 --> 01:17:12.749
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1985
01:17:12.749 --> 01:17:13.949
Let's start.

1986
01:17:13.949 --> 01:17:16.119
- Watch out.
- We're playing in formation.

1987
01:17:16.119 --> 01:17:17.890
- Attack.
- Did it start?

1988
01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:19.089
- Attack!
- Watch out, Jin Young.

1989
01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.930
- We will know when we see one.
- Did it start?

1990
01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:22.989
Start.

1991
01:17:23.289 --> 01:17:26.459
(Chan Yeol attacks.)

1992
01:17:26.459 --> 01:17:28.400
(What?)

1993
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.829
"Ah".

1994
01:17:30.129 --> 01:17:31.739
(His letter got revealed
only in 1 second.)

1995
01:17:31.739 --> 01:17:33.369
("Ah")

1996
01:17:33.369 --> 01:17:34.409
What is it?

1997
01:17:34.409 --> 01:17:35.640
"Ah".

1998
01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.669
Chan Yeol.

1999
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:39.079
I got it.

2000
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:42.150
"Bi".

2001
01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:43.980
"Ah".

2002
01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.749
("Bi")

2003
01:17:45.749 --> 01:17:47.279
"Bi".

2004
01:17:47.279 --> 01:17:48.820
"Bi".

2005
01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:50.489
"Bi".

2006
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:52.459
Was it you?

2007
01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:53.659
Come on.

2008
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.930
("Ri")

2009
01:17:55.989 --> 01:17:57.329
"Ri".

2010
01:17:57.829 --> 01:17:59.230
"Ri".

2011
01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:03.770
(2 letters of Team Hyun Moo
are revealed.)

2012

(Chan Yeol attacks Min Ho.)

2013
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.800
("S")

2014
01:18:07.239 --> 01:18:08.310
"S".

2015
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:09.369
- "Ah" and "Ri".
- "S".

2016
01:18:09.369 --> 01:18:12.239
(2 letters are revealed
for each team.)

2017
01:18:12.239 --> 01:18:13.640
"S" something.

2018
01:18:13.810 --> 01:18:15.409
- "Ah" and "Ri".
- Don't show your letter. That's it.

2019
01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.550
Protect it.

2020
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:18.279
(Su Geun is protected.)

2021
01:18:18.279 --> 01:18:20.350
That's it. Protect it.

2022
01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:25.119
(Why is he so strange?)

2023
01:18:25.119 --> 01:18:26.489
(Chan Yeol attacks Su Geun.)

2024
01:18:26.489 --> 01:18:27.730
- Protect it.
- What's that?

2025
01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:30.360
(He's in trouble.)

2026
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:31.560
This letter is important.

2027
01:18:32.159 --> 01:18:33.959
- Can you...
- You should take this one.

2028
01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:35.329
Should I take this one?

2029
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:37.230
I never reveal mine, do I?

2030
01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:38.369
(They will be in trouble
if the letter "Moi" is revealed.)

2031
01:18:38.369 --> 01:18:39.499
I just bite their hands.

2032
01:18:39.499 --> 01:18:40.699
Sana and I...

2033
01:18:40.699 --> 01:18:48.279
(2 letters are revealed
for both teams.)

2034
01:18:48.279 --> 01:18:51.279
"Moi".

2035
01:18:51.279 --> 01:18:52.520
I got it.

2036
01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.919
- I know it.
- What is it?

2037
01:18:53.919 --> 01:18:56.289
- I got it.
- I know it.

2038
01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:59.860
(They got the important word.)

2039
01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:04.760
(They got "Bi" "S" and "Moi".)

2040
01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.159
- Mobius strip.
- Mobius strip.

2041
01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.369
Chan Yeol got it.

2042
01:19:11.739 --> 01:19:13.140
Come on, Su Geun.

2043
01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.739
You should've protected me.

2044
01:19:14.739 --> 01:19:16.339
Was I supposed
to protect you?

2045
01:19:16.339 --> 01:19:17.839
Two people should've
protected me.

2046
01:19:17.839 --> 01:19:20.140
What did you guys do?

2047
01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:21.810
What did you do there?

2048
01:19:22.079 --> 01:19:23.150
(Team Hyun Moo's
word is mitochondria.)

2049
01:19:23.249 --> 01:19:25.949
Come on. Stop that.

2050
01:19:25.949 --> 01:19:27.020
(Team Hyun Moo's
word is mitochondria.)

2051
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.089
This is the finals now.

2052
01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:30.720
It's the finals.

2053
01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.159
This is...

2054
01:19:32.159 --> 01:19:33.419
- This is easy.
- This is too easy.

2055
01:19:33.419 --> 01:19:35.529
This is too easy.

2056
01:19:35.529 --> 01:19:36.959
The ones with these two letters
will attack.

2057
01:19:36.959 --> 01:19:38.560
- This should be protected.
- This is bad.

2058
01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.169
If they attack you,
just beat them.

2059
01:19:41.169 --> 01:19:42.300
- Just beat them.
- Really?

2060
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:44.029
It's the finals now.

2061
01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.470
(They will have to fight
with their full force.)

2062
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:46.940
No. Then... Okay.

2063
01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.510
That's good.

2064
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:49.570
(They guard each other.)

2065
01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:50.770
That's not bad.

2066
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:53.239
(They copy right away.)

2067
01:19:53.239 --> 01:19:54.480
What are you doing?

2068
01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.110
(You should get the permission.)

2069
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:57.310
- It's not bad.
- Let's go.

2070
01:19:57.449 --> 01:19:58.820
(Which team will get another hint?)

2071
01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:00.720
- Go!
- Come on.

2072
01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.020
- The final round begins.
- Let's go.

2073
01:20:03.589 --> 01:20:04.720
This is the finals.

2074
01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.789
(The final round begins.)

2075
01:20:05.789 --> 01:20:06.860
Let's go.

2076
01:20:07.789 --> 01:20:08.930
Henry.

2077
01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:11.329
(Henry unexpectedly
approaches them.)

2078
01:20:12.999 --> 01:20:15.430
("Bo")

2079
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.339
"Bo".

2080
01:20:19.339 --> 01:20:20.339
(His letter is "Bo".)

2081
01:20:20.339 --> 01:20:21.409
"Bo".

2082
01:20:21.409 --> 01:20:22.940
They didn't see it.

2083
01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:23.970
They saw it.

2084
01:20:23.970 --> 01:20:26.379
- It's "Bo".
- "Bo".

2085
01:20:26.379 --> 01:20:27.409
(Everyone saw it.)

2086
01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.310
- "Bo".
- Wait.

2087
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:30.310
(Let's attack.)

2088
01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:32.050
- "Bo".
- What's that?

2089
01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:34.419
("Ma")

2090
01:20:34.419 --> 01:20:35.449
("Bo" and "Ma" are revealed.)

2091
01:20:35.449 --> 01:20:37.220
(Su Geun has an idea.)

2092
01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.220
- "Bo".
- What's that?

2093
01:20:42.159 --> 01:20:43.190
"Bo" and "Ma".

2094
01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:44.629
- "Bae".
- "Bae".

2095
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:46.800
Look at my letter.

2096
01:20:46.959 --> 01:20:49.430
Just show them your letters.
I am confident to win. Come on.

2097
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:51.669
Turn back. If you trust me,
turn back.

2098
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:53.270
- Why are you yelling?
- Come on!

2099
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:54.709
(What is he saying?)

2100
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:56.270
- Say the answer.
- Say it.

2101
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:57.369
- Trust me.
- Say the answer.

2102
01:20:57.369 --> 01:20:58.779
All right. I got the answer.

2103
01:20:59.409 --> 01:21:01.480
It's a movie title. You move back.

2104
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:03.110
Do you want me
to give you a chance?

2105
01:21:04.249 --> 01:21:05.619
Choi Min Sik is in it.

2106
01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:07.220
You're joking.

2107
01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.520
(Su Geun makes guesses.)

2108
01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.050
There's "Ma".

2109
01:21:10.050 --> 01:21:11.419
There's "Ma".

2110
01:21:11.419 --> 01:21:13.260
Why don't you trust me?

2111
01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.529
"I Saw the Devil".

2112
01:21:14.529 --> 01:21:19.560
("I Saw the Devil")

2113
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.699
"I Saw the Devil".

2114
01:21:25.869 --> 01:21:29.039
(Team Su Geun wins.)

2115
01:21:29.039 --> 01:21:30.409
Why didn't you trust me?

2116
01:21:31.339 --> 01:21:33.480
I told you to reveal your letters.
Why don't you trust me?

2117
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.050
I trusted you, but you were upset.

2118
01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:37.510
I am sorry, but it's not
as easy as you say.

2119
01:21:37.779 --> 01:21:40.850
It's just like you claiming
to be an angel.

2120
01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:42.289
We could...

2121
01:21:42.289 --> 01:21:43.550
(Team Su Geun obtains
the last Key Guide.)

2122
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:45.789
- This is great.
- It's really great.

2123
01:21:45.789 --> 01:21:46.959
"You're joking."

2124
01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.959
(It's time to make an inference.)

2125
01:21:49.959 --> 01:21:51.159
This is crazy.

2126
01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:53.629
Let me ask you a favor.

2127
01:21:53.629 --> 01:21:55.369
- What?
- Key.

2128
01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:58.339
If you are Demon,
I admire your acting skill.

2129
01:21:58.339 --> 01:22:01.310
But don't say that you are Angel.

2130
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.770
Say that to them.

2131
01:22:02.770 --> 01:22:04.839
You seem to be Angel.

2132
01:22:04.839 --> 01:22:06.239
It's so obvious.

2133
01:22:06.239 --> 01:22:07.640
You saw the sunlight
coming through, didn't you?

2134
01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.050
It's the Angel's light.

2135
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:10.110
It's my halo.

2136
01:22:11.279 --> 01:22:12.449
I am the Angel.

2137
01:22:13.619 --> 01:22:15.119
I think everyone is
buying Su Geun's idea.

2138
01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.619
Su Geun convinced them.

2139
01:22:17.619 --> 01:22:18.619
Wait.

2140
01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.020
I hid it because...

2141
01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:21.390
Why did you hid it?
Why did you...

2142
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:23.659
- I will explain from the start.
- Tell me everything.

2143
01:22:23.659 --> 01:22:26.659
- First of all...
- Who's the angel?

2144
01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.029
- How can you be so slow?
- I am the Angel.

2145
01:22:29.529 --> 01:22:32.539
- He talked to only a few...
- I approached one person each time.

2146
01:22:32.539 --> 01:22:35.610
I needed to get a lot of votes
and make it fun.

2147
01:22:35.610 --> 01:22:38.039
But actually...

2148
01:22:38.039 --> 01:22:40.239
So you are Angel.

2149
01:22:40.239 --> 01:22:41.249
- It should remain a secret.
- All right.

2150
01:22:41.249 --> 01:22:44.820
- So we're allies, right?
- We are.

2151
01:22:44.949 --> 01:22:46.650
- I can count on her.
- X.

2152
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:49.449
(Su Geun coughs.)

2153
01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:53.820
They must look at me...

2154
01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:55.360
and question why
I am being interviewed alone.

2155
01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.800
Nobody cares.

2156
01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:58.829
(They're not interested
in Su Geun at all.)

2157
01:22:59.129 --> 01:23:00.360
They all think of me as Demon.

2158
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:05.999
It's sad. I told them the truth.

2159
01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:10.110
For over six hours, I've been
telling them I'm Angel.

2160
01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.180
They should at least cast doubts.

2161
01:23:13.379 --> 01:23:15.050
Nobody trusts me.

2162
01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:17.010
Not even one person.

2163
01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:18.050
(I am desperate for your trust.)

2164
01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.850
Why isn't my team
looking for me?

2165
01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:22.789
Su Geun ruined everything.

2166
01:23:23.489 --> 01:23:25.820
(They are busy badmouthing him.)

2167
01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.020
Su Geun is Demon.

2168
01:23:28.029 --> 01:23:29.459
What's the truth?

2169
01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.600
Su Geun is Demon, and I am Angel.

2170
01:23:32.730 --> 01:23:35.070
(Is Min Ho telling the truth?
Or is he acting badly?)

2171
01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:36.529
It's certain then.

2172
01:23:36.999 --> 01:23:38.169
I was the only one
telling the truth.

2173
01:23:38.169 --> 01:23:39.369
Didn't Seong Wu say anything?

2174
01:23:39.739 --> 01:23:42.270
I want to use the chance
and check if he's telling the truth.

2175
01:23:42.570 --> 01:23:45.110
Then just put me
on the Judgement Cabinet.

2176
01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:49.879
- I mean it.
- Doesn't he sound truthful?

2177
01:23:49.879 --> 01:23:52.279
- I am.
- Both of them sound truthful.

2178
01:23:52.279 --> 01:23:53.779
- I am convinced that you're not.
- I think he is.

2179
01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:55.720
I want to trust you too.

2180
01:23:55.919 --> 01:23:57.089
Then you can trust him.

2181
01:23:57.089 --> 01:23:58.159
(He's been diligently
building trust.)

2182
01:23:58.159 --> 01:24:00.220
- I have to either trust you or...
- Right.

2183
01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.690
I won't force you to trust me.

2184
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:03.789
If you are Demon,
that would be shocking.

2185
01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:06.199
- I am not Demon.
- X.

2186
01:24:06.199 --> 01:24:07.260
(Is Chan Yeol really Angel?)

2187
01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:08.730
In my life,

2188
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:10.699
I was never considered a liar.

2189
01:24:10.699 --> 01:24:12.539
I am naive,

2190
01:24:12.539 --> 01:24:14.909
and I do my work well.
Why do they not trust me?

2191
01:24:14.909 --> 01:24:16.669
Can you scratch my bag?
Why is it so itchy?

2192
01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:18.440
Why is my back suddenly so itchy?

2193
01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:19.610
(What is the real identity
of Su Geun?)

2194
01:24:20.079 --> 01:24:23.110
This Key Guide is going to be
very important.

2195
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:24.249
(Who is Angel and who is Demon?)

2196
01:24:24.919 --> 01:24:26.850
Jin Young said he got an O.

2197
01:24:26.850 --> 01:24:28.850
How can he get an O
when my name isn't there?

2198
01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:30.650
I trust people too easily.

2199
01:24:31.789 --> 01:24:33.959
I am tired of this now.

2200
01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:36.089
The shoulders.

2201
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.860
Your shoulders must be
all relaxed now.

2202
01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.400
- We...
- Which one do we choose?

2203
01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.999
Choosing five people
randomly is the best option.

2204
01:24:42.029 --> 01:24:44.029
- We have nothing to lose.
- We got nothing to lose.

2205
01:24:44.029 --> 01:24:46.600
- What's the point of choosing one?
- This is our last chance.

2206
01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.739
I think that's the best option.

2207
01:24:47.739 --> 01:24:49.239
It's my idea.

2208
01:24:49.239 --> 01:24:51.879
But the ones we have
already checked...

2209
01:24:51.879 --> 01:24:54.110
might get chosen again.

2210
01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:56.409
This is the best option.

2211
01:24:56.409 --> 01:24:57.879
Yes, it is the best option.

2212
01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:59.050
We don't have many choices.

2213
01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:01.820
You are nothing, and
you act as if you're something.

2214
01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:03.050
I want to prove myself.

2215
01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:04.860
Hyun Moo.

2216
01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:08.230
We will choose five players
randomly,

2217
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:11.199
and check if one of them
has the Master Key.

2218
01:25:11.199 --> 01:25:12.459
- Yes.
- We will pick that one.

2219
01:25:12.459 --> 01:25:14.570
One of the five people
will have the Master Key.

2220
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:16.800
But only we get to
know the result, right?

2221
01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:18.640
Only our team can know the result.

2222
01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.169
One of them has the Master Key.

2223
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:23.610
- Please reveal the list.
- Reveal the list.

2224
01:25:24.169 --> 01:25:28.279
(Who are the 5 people
who might have the Master Key?)

2225
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:32.619
See? My name is on there.

2226
01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:34.050
(Daniel, Min Ho, Sana, JR,
and Chan Yeol)

2227
01:25:34.050 --> 01:25:35.220
I told you.

2228
01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:38.020
You can't say that loudly.

2229
01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.089
(1 of them has the Master Key,
and the other 4 don't have it.)

2230
01:25:39.089 --> 01:25:40.760
Keep your voice down.

2231
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:43.989
Min Ho was the most
active person without anything.

2232
01:25:46.029 --> 01:25:47.060
I checked it.

2233
01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:50.529
No way.

2234
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.839
Now it's certain.

2235
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:58.180
Now you have more reasons to trust me.

2236
01:25:58.279 --> 01:26:00.010
See? I told you.

2237
01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:02.110
- You have to trust me more.
- It's me.

2238
01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:04.419
Didn't you see it?
Only Demon remains a mystery.

2239
01:26:04.419 --> 01:26:06.249
- My head hurts now.
- I know.

2240
01:26:06.249 --> 01:26:08.949
I told you. You just have to
find who Demon is.

2241
01:26:08.949 --> 01:26:10.220
I am Angel.

2242
01:26:10.449 --> 01:26:12.390
1 of these 5 people
have the Master Key.

2243
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:14.159
Look at you.

2244
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:17.029
I am sorry, but can you move,
Mr. Nobody?

2245
01:26:18.659 --> 01:26:20.129
I am not worried at all.

2246
01:26:20.129 --> 01:26:22.230
- I am not worried at all.
- Are we certain now?

2247
01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.029
The rest are...

2248
01:26:24.029 --> 01:26:25.039
(Is Su Geun Angel or Demon?)

2249
01:26:25.039 --> 01:26:27.400
That was really surprising,
wasn't it?

2250
01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.409
This is really difficult.

2251
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:31.680
Now, it's time to decide.

2252
01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:33.039
Get your key...

2253
01:26:33.039 --> 01:26:34.310
- and...
- Room of Fate.

2254
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:36.150
Let's go to the Room of Fate.

2255
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:38.980
It's me. I am telling you.

2256
01:26:39.579 --> 01:26:41.020
It's Su Geun and...

2257
01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:42.690
Su Geun is Demon, and I am Angel.

2258
01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:44.320
- No.
- Why?

2259
01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.320
The Angel is Chan Yeol.

2260
01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.390
No, he got an X.

2261
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:52.129
It's really me. I mean it.

2262
01:26:52.329 --> 01:26:54.699
- Demon can't win in this world.
- Right.

2263
01:26:54.699 --> 01:26:56.800
I can't live in the world
where Demon wins.

2264
01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.869
Really?

2265
01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.369
If I am Demon...

2266
01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.640
What will you bet this time?

2267
01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.810
What should I bet?
What If I am Demon?

2268
01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:05.810
- What will you bet?
- Anything you want.

2269
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:06.980
- Really?
- I can bet anything.

2270
01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:09.209
Really?
Invite me to your concert.

2271
01:27:09.209 --> 01:27:11.550
Okay. I will. Say I'm Demon.

2272
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:12.749
I can invite you.

2273
01:27:13.150 --> 01:27:14.650
If I am Demon,
I'll invite you as our guest.

2274
01:27:14.650 --> 01:27:16.220
Really? Yes!

2275
01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:17.489
(Yes!)

2276
01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.959
You are really happy.

2277
01:27:19.159 --> 01:27:21.190
(I am a successful fan.)

2278
01:27:21.329 --> 01:27:23.890
You've got ballots.

2279
01:27:23.959 --> 01:27:27.829
Don't write down two names.
Write your name on the very top.

2280
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:31.570
Write down the name of the person
who has the Angel's Master Key.

2281
01:27:31.739 --> 01:27:32.739
- Okay? Just one person.
- Okay.

2282
01:27:32.739 --> 01:27:35.539
If you don't have any idea,
you may write my name for fun.

2283
01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:37.839
- Just for fun.
- He's very persistent.

2284
01:27:37.839 --> 01:27:39.779
Wait. How about Demon?

2285
01:27:39.779 --> 01:27:41.579
- Just Angel this time.
- Just Angel.

2286
01:27:41.579 --> 01:27:42.980
(They have to guess who has
the Angel's Master Key.)

2287
01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.480
(Who is the Angel?)

2288
01:27:46.279 --> 01:27:48.489
We have to write the name.

2289
01:27:48.489 --> 01:27:49.949
- I am happy.
- It's over.

2290
01:27:49.949 --> 01:27:51.489
- It's over.
- Should I put it here?

2291
01:27:52.289 --> 01:27:53.589
(The voting is over.)

2292
01:27:53.589 --> 01:27:55.659
It's really nerve-racking now.

2293
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:58.499
This is a blockbuster variety show,
Mater Key.

2294
01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:02.230
(The prize box is revealed.)

2295
01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:08.110
Please.

2296
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:12.409
The player who received
the most number of...

2297
01:28:12.539 --> 01:28:14.239
votes will be revealed.

2298
01:28:14.409 --> 01:28:16.810
- Who got the most number of votes?
- Who is it?

2299
01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:19.949
Many people thought
of this person to be the angel.

2300
01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.390
All right. Please reveal the result.

2301
01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:26.459
- This is really nerve-racking.
- I am scared.

2302
01:28:28.329 --> 01:28:30.029
It's beating fast.

2303
01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.060
A lot of people believed
this person to be the angel.

2304
01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:35.300
(Only 1 player will get the chance
to open the prize box.)

2305
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:36.300
Please reveal the result.

2306
01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:37.940
(Only 1 player will get the chance
to open the prize box.)

2307
01:28:40.739 --> 01:28:41.739
It's scary.

2308
01:28:42.739 --> 01:28:43.839
Really?

2309
01:28:43.839 --> 01:28:47.239
(Chan Yeol got the most votes.)

2310
01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:48.480
- Really?
- You made the right choice.

2311
01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.810
- Chan Yeol.
- Really?

2312
01:28:50.779 --> 01:28:51.779
Did Chan Yeol get the most votes?

2313
01:28:51.779 --> 01:28:53.480
- Really?
- He's Demon.

2314
01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:54.919
He's nothing.

2315
01:28:54.919 --> 01:28:56.949
- Chan Yeol, go up the podium.
- Yes.

2316
01:28:58.419 --> 01:29:00.860
- Chan Yeol is...
- I trust him.

2317
01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:02.730
- Chan Yeol...
- I trust you.

2318
01:29:02.989 --> 01:29:06.329
Whether he's the angel or not,
he will take the key.

2319
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:08.770
- A gold bar.
- He'll take the gold bar...

2320
01:29:09.199 --> 01:29:10.829
because he got the most votes.

2321
01:29:10.829 --> 01:29:13.400
- I am dizzy.
- But he's actually Demon.

2322
01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:15.909
- What is he?
- Put your key...

2323
01:29:16.209 --> 01:29:17.909
in the keyhole.

2324
01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.980
If the key doesn't unlock the box,

2325
01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.980
it means he's not the owner of
the Master Key.

2326
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:27.150
It means he's just a normal player.
But if the key unlocks the box,

2327
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:30.119
and if he's Angel,
the light will turn green.

2328
01:29:30.919 --> 01:29:33.589
If he's Demon,
the light will turn red.

2329
01:29:33.589 --> 01:29:36.329
If he's Demon,
he will get the prize...

2330
01:29:36.329 --> 01:29:39.100
- I wish he's Demon.
- multiplied by the votes.

2331
01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:41.300
- I think he's Demon.
- You better be Angel.

2332
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:43.999
- Check...
- I trust you.

2333
01:29:44.029 --> 01:29:45.839
- You didn't trust me.
- if it's the Master Key.

2334
01:29:46.169 --> 01:29:48.570
- This is crazy.
- It's in.

2335
01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.339
- Maybe he's Demon.
- Let's check...

2336
01:29:51.279 --> 01:29:52.279
if it's the Master Key.

2337
01:29:52.879 --> 01:29:54.310
- Should I turn the key?
- You should.

2338
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:55.980
He's Demon.

2339
01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.579
You are...

2340
01:29:58.279 --> 01:30:00.180
- I think he's Demon.
- No.

2341
01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:02.249
- Let's see.
- It's true.

2342
01:30:02.249 --> 01:30:04.560
- I am dizzy.
- You thought he was Angel.

2343
01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:06.459
Let's check if it's the Master Key.

2344
01:30:06.789 --> 01:30:09.230
(The box didn't open.)

2345
01:30:09.230 --> 01:30:11.629
(He wasn't the owner of
the Master Key.)

2346
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:13.129
- He's nobody.
- He was nobody.

2347
01:30:13.499 --> 01:30:14.629
Is he nobody?

2348
01:30:16.029 --> 01:30:17.470
Then why did he talk so much?

2349
01:30:17.839 --> 01:30:19.839
I talked the most.
Why didn't you choose me?

2350
01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.310
- He talked so much.
- I thought...

2351
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:25.010
(How did Chan Yeol win?)

2352
01:30:27.039 --> 01:30:31.249
(This key is not the Master Key.)

2353
01:30:32.079 --> 01:30:34.850
(Nothing was special until then.)

2354
01:30:36.989 --> 01:30:39.619
(He earned the Gold Chance Card
through the Watcher vote.)

2355
01:30:39.619 --> 01:30:42.629
(And he earned the chance
to vote twice in the final vote.)

2356
01:30:42.959 --> 01:30:44.190
I am getting replies.

2357
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.070
(And he checked that Su Geun was
the owner of the Master Key.)

2358
01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:52.300
At first, I didn't want anything,
but now I want to give it a go.

2359
01:30:53.039 --> 01:30:54.039
I am Angel.

2360
01:30:54.409 --> 01:30:55.640
I am Angel.

2361
01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:59.180
You are my ally,
so I am telling you this.

2362
01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:01.510
I have two votes, you know?

2363
01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:04.720
If their votes get dispersed,
I will have a chance.

2364
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:06.419
I am Angel.

2365
01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:07.720
It's...

2366
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:09.050
Chan Yeol is Angel.

2367
01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.589
Chan Yeol is Angel.

2368
01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:12.760
No, he got an X.

2369
01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.930
I am so nervous.

2370
01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:17.230
(It was the result of
his hard work.)

2371
01:31:17.230 --> 01:31:18.560
I started the fire.

2372
01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.730
(He got the most number of votes.)

2373
01:31:19.730 --> 01:31:20.730
This is a game.

2374
01:31:21.369 --> 01:31:24.199
(Chan Yeol wins the game.)

2375
01:31:24.199 --> 01:31:25.400
He was nobody.

2376
01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:28.640
- Was he nobody?
- Is he just the normal Player?

2377
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:31.279
- Did you get an X?
- Nobody from our team chose him.

2378
01:31:31.279 --> 01:31:33.980
- He's not Angel.
- Look at that.

2379
01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:35.749
- Seven votes?
- He gets everything.

2380
01:31:36.079 --> 01:31:37.350
- He gets seven.
- This is unfair.

2381
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:39.650
- Does he get 12 then?
- Does he get 12?

2382
01:31:39.850 --> 01:31:42.390
Be quiet.

2383
01:31:42.419 --> 01:31:44.589
This is crazy.

2384
01:31:44.589 --> 01:31:46.820
How could you...

2385
01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:48.989
- I trusted you.
- Stop it.

2386
01:31:48.989 --> 01:31:50.089
I can't believe it.

2387
01:31:50.159 --> 01:31:52.060
You're in no position to be
talking right now.

2388
01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.959
Who's Angel and who's Demon?

2389
01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.270
Who's Angel and who's Demon?

2390
01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.999
The two owners of the Master Key
should step forward.

2391
01:31:59.669 --> 01:32:00.869
My goodness.

2392
01:32:00.869 --> 01:32:01.869
Min Ho.

2393
01:32:02.239 --> 01:32:03.239
Is he Angel?

2394
01:32:03.570 --> 01:32:04.579
Is he Demon?

2395
01:32:05.379 --> 01:32:07.079
- You're not it.
- Please go up the podium.

2396
01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:09.110
- I told you. Right?
- Min Ho.

2397
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:12.350
- I knew about Min Ho.
- You didn't know.

2398
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:14.220
But I knew about you.

2399
01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:15.720
You were too talkative.

2400
01:32:15.789 --> 01:32:17.650
- You...
- Is it really Min Ho?

2401
01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:18.860
You...

2402
01:32:19.159 --> 01:32:20.390
- Min Ho.
- Really?

2403
01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:22.459
- What's up with her?
- Min Ho.

2404
01:32:23.029 --> 01:32:24.029
I am sorry.

2405
01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:26.060
Nobody listened to me.

2406
01:32:26.199 --> 01:32:28.270
You talked way too much.

2407
01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:31.539
Between Su Geun and Min Ho,

2408
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:32.940
who do you think is Angel?

2409
01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:34.409
I think it's Su Geun.

2410
01:32:35.239 --> 01:32:37.940
- I think so too.
- Two votes for Su Geun.

2411
01:32:39.339 --> 01:32:42.110
(Even if)

2412
01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:43.110
Hey.

2413
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:44.249
(You regret it now)

2414
01:32:44.249 --> 01:32:45.249
Su Geun.

2415
01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:48.650
Let's check...

2416
01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:51.760
- Su Geun's Master Key.
- Please.

2417
01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:53.459
- Please.
- Please.

2418
01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.529
Let's see.

2419
01:32:56.029 --> 01:32:57.730
(He had the Angel's Master Key.)

2420
01:32:57.730 --> 01:32:59.159
Why did I get beaten?

2421
01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.329
- What was it?
- A book fell down.

2422
01:33:01.329 --> 01:33:03.270
I planted you.

2423
01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:05.470
Min Ho was Demon.

2424
01:33:05.539 --> 01:33:06.900
My goodness.

2425
01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:11.279
(From the beginning, he's been
claiming to be Angel.)

2426
01:33:11.279 --> 01:33:12.579
(This key is the Angel's
Master Key.)

2427
01:33:12.579 --> 01:33:14.180
I am certain about it.

2428
01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:18.220
(He always spoke the truth.)

2429
01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:21.989
(But everyone doubted him.)

2430
01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.289
You know we're on the same boat.

2431
01:33:24.459 --> 01:33:25.919
I will put my hand on my chest
and say this.

2432
01:33:25.919 --> 01:33:33.930
(He put his hand on his chest
and even knelt down.)

2433
01:33:36.669 --> 01:33:43.909
(People continued to accuse him of
being the demon.)

2434
01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:46.680
It's not showing.

2435
01:33:47.339 --> 01:33:49.249
It's because you're nobody.

2436
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:52.919
(The other Master Key went
to Min Ho, the Demon.)

2437
01:33:52.919 --> 01:33:55.050
(He started pretending
to be Angel.)

2438
01:33:55.119 --> 01:33:57.489
What did it say on your screen?

2439
01:33:58.060 --> 01:33:59.560
- It said it was the Angel's Key.
- What was it?

2440
01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.919
The Angel's Key.

2441
01:34:01.459 --> 01:34:03.329
(Why did he stammer?)

2442
01:34:05.159 --> 01:34:09.730
(He couldn't
keep a good poker face.)

2443
01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:13.539
(So he decided to talk
to one person at a time.)

2444
01:34:13.539 --> 01:34:15.940
(But everyone turned away from him.)

2445
01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:17.570
I can't be the demon.

2446
01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.539
Why didn't you...

2447
01:34:20.539 --> 01:34:23.249
Why didn't you doubt for one
second that I could be Angel?

2448
01:34:23.749 --> 01:34:26.020
I trusted Chan Yeol.

2449
01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:27.379
- I am sorry.
- All right.

2450
01:34:27.379 --> 01:34:29.520
Today's winner is Chan Yeol.

2451
01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:31.520
Congratulations.

2452
01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:34.289
(What will happen
on the next episode?)

2453
01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:38.029
(The psychological warfare gets
even more intense.)

2454
01:34:38.029 --> 01:34:40.600
(The moment you trust someone,
you will be fooled.)

2455
01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:44.499
(The moment you are deceived,
you will lose.)

2456
01:34:44.839 --> 01:34:48.039
- I am Angel.
- Turn off the light.

2457
01:34:48.909 --> 01:34:52.739
(They have to run,
spin, and fight...)

2458
01:34:52.739 --> 01:34:56.010
(to find Angel and Demon.)

2459
01:34:56.310 --> 01:35:00.749
(Angel will whisper,
and Demon will lure.)

2460
01:35:01.619 --> 01:35:03.619
- Are you Angel or are you Demon?
- Are you Angel or are you Demon?

2461
01:35:03.619 --> 01:35:05.959
(The Master Key, Angel and Demon)
