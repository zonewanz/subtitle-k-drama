1
00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.561
"Great work, Doctor Kim."

2
00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:11.631
"I was able to save the patient, thanks to you."

3
00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:16.301
It looks like he beat you to it.

4
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:18.912
They make a better couple than I thought.

5
00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:23.041
Shall we make a toast too?

6
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:35.861
It's true.

7
00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:38.431
Do you still not believe it?

8
00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:40.292
Fine.

9
00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:44.332
I'm not going to deny something I witnessed myself,

10
00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:46.631
but I still can't acknowledge it.

11
00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:49.402
I'll think about this though.

12
00:00:49.772 --> 00:00:52.912
"There are things that science can't prove right now."

13
00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:55.111
"Is it okay to consider them false?"

14
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:58.012
Gosh, this is quite motivating.

15
00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:01.952
All right. I will prove it all to you even scientifically.

16
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:05.592
That's pretty.

17
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:09.292
You look much prettier when you smile.

18
00:01:26.572 --> 00:01:28.311
- You came here yourself? - Yes.

19
00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:31.311
It's a special order from the director. Be careful.

20
00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:34.822
- From my dad? - How is he related to the patient?

21
00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:39.421
Who is he? Why would the director care so much about him?

22
00:01:40.592 --> 00:01:42.322
Who is he?

23
00:01:42.322 --> 00:01:43.992
You should ask my dad.

24
00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:45.891
I'm curious what he'd say.

25
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:49.361
Please take good care of him.

26
00:01:50.102 --> 00:01:51.501
That depends on how you behave.

27
00:01:53.602 --> 00:01:54.702
Go to the hospital first.

28
00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:56.941
I'll come see you after work.

29
00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:02.482
Have a good day, Dr. Song.

30
00:02:02.482 --> 00:02:03.742
- Okay. See you later. - All right.

31
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.081
See you.

32
00:02:16.692 --> 00:02:17.762
Hello?

33
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:20.461
What?

34
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:27.572
- We have a problem. - What do you mean?

35
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:30.671
Is there a problem with Mr. Park Soo Bong?

36
00:02:31.912 --> 00:02:33.371
It's not that.

37
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:45.551
Mom!

38
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:48.792
What? Do you want me to feed you?

39
00:02:49.562 --> 00:02:50.591
Goodness.

40
00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:53.262
You must be confused.

41
00:02:53.262 --> 00:02:55.132
My mom always takes things too far.

42
00:02:55.602 --> 00:02:56.801
I'll take care of it now.

43
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:00.572
Mom, what's the matter with you?

44
00:03:00.702 --> 00:03:02.442
This is a clear invasion of privacy.

45
00:03:02.442 --> 00:03:03.771
Gosh, let go of me.

46
00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:06.072
She'll get sick protecting her privacy.

47
00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:09.482
She has such great responsibilities. She should at least sleep well.

48
00:03:09.482 --> 00:03:10.551
Mom.

49
00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:12.912
Is this too much?

50
00:03:15.051 --> 00:03:16.151
Of course, it is.

51
00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:19.651
A favor that one didn't ask for is not a favor.

52
00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:20.921
No.

53
00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:23.891
Thank you.

54
00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:26.431
It's okay, right?

55
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:29.002
I'm glad.

56
00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:32.401
I didn't buy these. I made them myself...

57
00:03:32.632 --> 00:03:34.271
so you can sleep comfortably.

58
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:36.341
Move over.

59
00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:42.982
Would you try lying down?

60
00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:21.622
Oh, dear.

61
00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:24.252
You must be thinking of your mother.

62
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:29.762
I know that face too.

63
00:04:32.362 --> 00:04:33.762
That's the face...

64
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:37.971
I see every day in the mirror.

65
00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:48.281
Can I give you a hug?

66
00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:52.252
I also...

67
00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:56.351
lost a child.

68
00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:59.952
I'd like to give you a hug.

69
00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:42.262
- Did you send your car away? - Yes.

70
00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:45.432
Wait here. I'll get mine.

71
00:05:47.802 --> 00:05:50.911
- Thank you. - I should thank you.

72
00:05:51.172 --> 00:05:53.141
You accepted my gifts without complaint.

73
00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.711
Sleep well, and don't skip your meals.

74
00:05:58.252 --> 00:06:00.281
- Okay. - And...

75
00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:03.452
visit me at home one day.

76
00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:06.791
I'm actually not too bad a cook.

77
00:06:08.622 --> 00:06:11.192
- But ma'am. - Yes?

78
00:06:11.192 --> 00:06:13.802
Thank you for the bedding and curtains.

79
00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:16.702
But could you let me pay for...

80
00:06:16.702 --> 00:06:18.432
the bed and drawers?

81
00:06:18.432 --> 00:06:20.672
The bed and drawers?

82
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:22.141
Yes.

83
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:26.442
- I didn't buy those. - Pardon?

84
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:29.781
Gosh, that's hot.

85
00:06:29.981 --> 00:06:32.281
Of course, we bought them.

86
00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:34.922
With our preciously tiny budget.

87
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:37.192
We took you seriously when you said...

88
00:06:37.192 --> 00:06:39.452
not to buy you anything.

89
00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:40.661
I brought you on board,

90
00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:43.591
but I didn't think you'd stay for long.

91
00:06:43.591 --> 00:06:46.091
- But... - It was my idea.

92
00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:47.401
You work day and night.

93
00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:50.771
You can't sleep on the floor in a sleeping bag.

94
00:06:50.971 --> 00:06:53.841
Do that, and your back will kill you when you're my age.

95
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:56.341
That, and I got the impression that...

96
00:06:56.341 --> 00:06:58.041
you'd be staying for a while.

97
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.041
What? Are you displeased?

98
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:04.581
Are you still trying to go back?

99
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:07.322
No. I like being on the hospital ship.

100
00:07:07.422 --> 00:07:10.622
Right? I thought you did.

101
00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:14.692
Is something bothering you?

102
00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:16.521
Not really.

103
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:18.932
Your expression says otherwise.

104
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:21.932
I should get going.

105
00:07:21.932 --> 00:07:23.971
Not now. Stay for dinner.

106
00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:27.802
We're cooking something that'll bring home the daughters-in-law.

107
00:07:28.172 --> 00:07:31.012
- What? - We're grilling gizzard shads.

108
00:07:31.012 --> 00:07:33.341
Doctor Kwak went to buy some. He won't be long.

109
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:35.641
Eat with us, then leave.

110
00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:38.651
It's almost time for my shift. Enjoy your meal.

111
00:07:40.952 --> 00:07:43.151
She rarely gets to eat on time.

112
00:07:43.382 --> 00:07:46.021
She might end up sick herself.

113
00:07:46.021 --> 00:07:50.192
I haven't seen her take a break at all this month.

114
00:07:50.192 --> 00:07:52.062
I think it's because of the debt.

115
00:07:52.062 --> 00:07:55.601
Half her salary is seized before she even gets paid.

116
00:07:56.661 --> 00:07:58.271
That goes to the bank.

117
00:07:58.731 --> 00:08:02.072
I think she's dealing with loan sharks this time.

118
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:06.242
What? Loan sharks?

119
00:08:51.422 --> 00:08:53.491
Five-car pile-up on Route 14.

120
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:54.792
Patients are incoming.

121
00:08:54.792 --> 00:08:56.361
Bruises and neck fracture.

122
00:08:56.361 --> 00:08:59.062
- Let's move it. - Do you hear me?

123
00:08:59.062 --> 00:09:01.662
Zone A, get a CT of his respiratory system.

124
00:09:01.662 --> 00:09:04.871
Check vitals, and get a head CT. Go to Zone A.

125
00:09:04.971 --> 00:09:07.702
Full-body burns!

126
00:09:07.702 --> 00:09:09.741
Take him to the burns unit.

127
00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:12.772
Move it. He's fading.

128
00:09:31.432 --> 00:09:34.961
1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3.

129
00:09:34.961 --> 00:09:36.702
- Swap with me. - Okay.

130
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:40.402
150 joules. Clear.

131
00:09:43.001 --> 00:09:44.072
1, 2,

132
00:09:44.072 --> 00:09:46.841
- 200 joules. - 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

133
00:09:46.841 --> 00:09:47.981
Clear.

134
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:55.182
02:52.

135
00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:58.121
The patient is dead.

136
00:09:58.892 --> 00:10:00.922
- Call his guardian. - Okay.

137
00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:18.042
If that's not it, is it about your mom?

138
00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:20.912
Because I couldn't save her?

139
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:24.351
Isn't that obvious?

140
00:10:25.481 --> 00:10:27.182
If you were me,

141
00:10:28.052 --> 00:10:31.322
would you be able to not hate me?

142
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:14.361
Okay, that'll do.

143
00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:29.841
What's this? Why is he bleeding?

144
00:11:30.782 --> 00:11:32.511
It's you, not him.

145
00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:35.954
Don't lean back.

146
00:11:35.979 --> 00:11:37.621
The bloodcould block your airway.

147
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:39.091
Do you want to suffocate?

148
00:11:39.221 --> 00:11:41.192
What surgeon doesn't know that?

149
00:11:49.216 --> 00:11:52.448
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 18 Hospital Ship "Do You Like Him?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

150
00:12:18.261 --> 00:12:19.562
Are you okay?

151
00:12:20.562 --> 00:12:21.961
You wouldn't be.

152
00:12:23.402 --> 00:12:26.772
- What are you doing? - Just come with me.

153
00:12:29.871 --> 00:12:31.741
What are you doing?

154
00:12:31.741 --> 00:12:34.542
I knew my dad was merciless,

155
00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:36.841
but this is just too much.

156
00:12:37.611 --> 00:12:40.721
How could he put a doctor through so much?

157
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:41.851
Doctor.

158
00:12:44.792 --> 00:12:46.892
- Doctor Kim. - 15 minutes.

159
00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:49.261
That's how long a cycle lasts.

160
00:12:57.231 --> 00:13:00.001
From the day my mom came in until today,

161
00:13:00.542 --> 00:13:02.642
you didn't take a day off.

162
00:13:02.871 --> 00:13:05.412
And today, you even performed a tough operation.

163
00:13:05.412 --> 00:13:07.481
If you work so hard without a break,

164
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:11.851
even healthy men collapse out of exhaustion.

165
00:13:12.312 --> 00:13:14.221
Empty your mind,

166
00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:17.322
and for just 15 minutes, let...

167
00:13:27.261 --> 00:13:28.861
She's resting already.

168
00:14:34.461 --> 00:14:35.702
You're here.

169
00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:39.432
Today, do you...

170
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:43.642
Why are you up?

171
00:14:45.542 --> 00:14:49.111
I was working on something.

172
00:14:52.052 --> 00:14:53.251
What's that?

173
00:14:53.251 --> 00:14:56.052
I got this in the mail today.

174
00:14:56.851 --> 00:14:59.121
It's from Doctor Song Eun Jae.

175
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:11.702
Will you answer them?

176
00:15:13.302 --> 00:15:14.841
As best I can.

177
00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:35.822
Doctor Song...

178
00:15:37.662 --> 00:15:39.861
always brings you back to me.

179
00:15:43.162 --> 00:15:44.272
But I...

180
00:15:45.772 --> 00:15:47.501
took her mother...

181
00:15:49.672 --> 00:15:51.072
away from her.

182
00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:56.682
But I can't give up.

183
00:16:00.652 --> 00:16:02.251
I just can't.

184
00:16:04.552 --> 00:16:06.522
You shouldn't give up.

185
00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:10.491
Until the last moment, a doctor...

186
00:16:21.042 --> 00:16:23.442
must never give up on his patient.

187
00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:28.341
Because from that moment,

188
00:16:30.952 --> 00:16:32.611
you are no longer a doctor.

189
00:17:15.061 --> 00:17:18.061
- You're early today. - I woke early.

190
00:17:20.632 --> 00:17:23.461
- Did you sleep well? - What's he doing here?

191
00:17:23.461 --> 00:17:25.801
To get things for the hospital.

192
00:17:28.442 --> 00:17:29.642
Thank you.

193
00:17:30.642 --> 00:17:32.642
I came to thank you too.

194
00:17:33.241 --> 00:17:36.211
Thank you for taking care of Pops.

195
00:17:37.882 --> 00:17:40.112
You shouldn't be thanking me.

196
00:17:40.152 --> 00:17:42.221
Family members help each other out.

197
00:17:42.821 --> 00:17:45.721
- I'm off. - Where's breakfast?

198
00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:48.862
Do you want it now?

199
00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:54.362
Can he stay as well?

200
00:18:07.511 --> 00:18:08.882
- So... - Dad...

201
00:18:08.882 --> 00:18:12.751
Are you two telepathic this morning?

202
00:18:14.481 --> 00:18:17.082
- Go ahead. - No, you first.

203
00:18:17.082 --> 00:18:19.491
You first. Don't make me repeat myself.

204
00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:24.531
- It's about Doctor Song. - Okay.

205
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:27.832
She works too hard in the ER.

206
00:18:28.301 --> 00:18:30.702
So what? Are you complaining?

207
00:18:31.102 --> 00:18:33.842
Will you protest against a ruthless employer?

208
00:18:33.942 --> 00:18:35.702
No, that's not it.

209
00:18:36.172 --> 00:18:38.241
I didn't tell her to work so hard.

210
00:18:38.541 --> 00:18:41.182
- She wanted to. - She wanted to?

211
00:18:41.182 --> 00:18:43.442
She seems to have a problem.

212
00:18:43.612 --> 00:18:46.251
- A problem? - Money problems, I think.

213
00:18:47.622 --> 00:18:50.692
Over half of her salary is seized every month.

214
00:18:53.092 --> 00:18:55.291
Do you want to take care of it?

215
00:18:55.622 --> 00:18:57.892
- Me? - What do you mean?

216
00:18:58.192 --> 00:19:00.231
I don't know what happened,

217
00:19:00.392 --> 00:19:03.702
but Doctor Song doesn't seem like the type to get into trouble.

218
00:19:04.471 --> 00:19:06.372
I think it's a family issue.

219
00:19:06.672 --> 00:19:08.672
We could sort it out for her.

220
00:19:08.672 --> 00:19:10.402
Honey, are you saying...

221
00:19:12.142 --> 00:19:14.281
What do you think about her?

222
00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:17.652
I would like to welcome her into our family.

223
00:19:17.652 --> 00:19:20.981
You can't say something like that out of the blue.

224
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:25.892
- Why? Do you disapprove? - No, I don't, but...

225
00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:29.122
shouldn't we ask what he thinks?

226
00:19:29.122 --> 00:19:30.491
What a day.

227
00:19:31.362 --> 00:19:32.362
What do you mean?

228
00:19:32.362 --> 00:19:35.662
Dad and I agree on something for once.

229
00:19:36.501 --> 00:19:38.172
- Hey. - Will you try?

230
00:19:38.231 --> 00:19:40.172
Yes, with all my might.

231
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:42.672
Then let's invite her over.

232
00:19:42.771 --> 00:19:46.471
- Why are you so rushed? - So is it a yes or a no?

233
00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:49.711
It's a yes, okay? Yes.

234
00:20:23.211 --> 00:20:25.682
- Who is it? - I'm from the hospital ship.

235
00:20:26.112 --> 00:20:28.122
- It won't take long. - Okay.

236
00:20:45.672 --> 00:20:47.902
I'm from the hospital ship. Is anyone home?

237
00:20:58.251 --> 00:21:00.352
- Did you finish your medicine? - Yes.

238
00:21:00.882 --> 00:21:02.021
How do you feel now?

239
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:04.452
- Are you breathing easier? - Yes.

240
00:21:05.092 --> 00:21:07.662
Good. I'll listen to your heart.

241
00:21:07.761 --> 00:21:09.892
Where does it hurt, ma'am?

242
00:21:09.892 --> 00:21:13.461
My knees are killing me.

243
00:21:13.461 --> 00:21:15.231
Oh dear.

244
00:21:15.902 --> 00:21:20.001
Don't you worry. I'll take the pain all away.

245
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:24.112
It will sting a bit.

246
00:21:25.672 --> 00:21:27.882
- What's going on? - I don't know.

247
00:21:28.442 --> 00:21:30.182
What brings you here?

248
00:21:30.342 --> 00:21:32.382
You're so kind today.

249
00:21:32.612 --> 00:21:34.051
Did you eat something bad?

250
00:21:34.051 --> 00:21:36.582
What do you mean? Being kind is good.

251
00:21:36.882 --> 00:21:38.922
We only live once.

252
00:21:40.521 --> 00:21:41.692
My goodness.

253
00:21:42.991 --> 00:21:45.791
- You don't have to see me out. - Take care, doctor.

254
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:49.362
- Goodbye. - I won't go far.

255
00:21:53.372 --> 00:21:55.571
- Take this. - You don't have to.

256
00:21:55.571 --> 00:21:57.912
It's okay. Share it with the others.

257
00:21:59.011 --> 00:22:00.711
I saw you take the bribe.

258
00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:04.781
You'll share, won't you?

259
00:22:06.612 --> 00:22:08.622
What time do you start at the ER today?

260
00:22:08.622 --> 00:22:10.152
I don't work today.

261
00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:12.152
Then...

262
00:22:13.392 --> 00:22:16.021
shall we have dinner together? I have something to say.

263
00:22:17.092 --> 00:22:21.061
Sorry, I can't. I have an important appointment.

264
00:22:34.682 --> 00:22:35.842
Over here.

265
00:22:41.422 --> 00:22:43.721
Sorry for being late.

266
00:22:43.922 --> 00:22:46.592
I got here early. Please, sit.

267
00:22:56.702 --> 00:22:59.231
Why did you ask to see me?

268
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:02.942
Take your time. Have some tea first.

269
00:23:10.781 --> 00:23:11.852
(Woo Jae)

270
00:23:15.122 --> 00:23:17.422
Take it. It could be urgent.

271
00:23:20.791 --> 00:23:23.622
No, I don't need to. I'll call back later.

272
00:23:24.192 --> 00:23:25.192
(Power off)

273
00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:37.711
Hello?

274
00:23:38.511 --> 00:23:40.372
Yes, this is the hospital ship dorm.

275
00:23:42.112 --> 00:23:43.981
She isn't in. Who's calling?

276
00:23:45.781 --> 00:23:47.152
Who?

277
00:23:48.221 --> 00:23:51.221
The phone has been turned off. Please leave a message.

278
00:23:54.521 --> 00:23:57.932
Would you not like to move back to Seoul to work?

279
00:23:59.832 --> 00:24:01.231
How about Sewoon Hospital?

280
00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:03.501
It's nothing like Seoul Daehan Hospital,

281
00:24:03.902 --> 00:24:06.172
but it's one of the top five hospitals in Korea.

282
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:08.602
Think about it.

283
00:24:08.741 --> 00:24:10.102
I'll pull some strings.

284
00:24:10.571 --> 00:24:13.571
How? What are your strings?

285
00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:16.781
My dad's older brother is on the board.

286
00:24:16.781 --> 00:24:19.412
It won't be hard. He likes me a lot.

287
00:24:19.511 --> 00:24:21.051
You're being too generous.

288
00:24:21.622 --> 00:24:24.592
I'm not being generous. I'm doing this for myself.

289
00:24:27.092 --> 00:24:28.592
Is it a win-win?

290
00:24:29.092 --> 00:24:32.531
I get a woman out of Hyun's sight,

291
00:24:32.531 --> 00:24:35.662
and you get a job at a major hospital.

292
00:24:38.432 --> 00:24:39.731
I should get going.

293
00:24:39.902 --> 00:24:42.071
- Is that a no? - Yes.

294
00:24:43.402 --> 00:24:44.811
What's your reason?

295
00:24:44.942 --> 00:24:47.711
Why do you want to stay on a shabby ship?

296
00:24:47.711 --> 00:24:49.142
Watch what you say.

297
00:24:49.612 --> 00:24:52.112
To the islanders, this ship is their savior.

298
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:55.281
- Is that why you want to stay? - That's right.

299
00:24:56.821 --> 00:24:59.221
Do you want to stay on the hospital ship...

300
00:24:59.652 --> 00:25:01.291
or stay near Hyun?

301
00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:06.261
Answer me.

302
00:25:06.731 --> 00:25:08.702
- Do you like him? - Yes.

303
00:25:09.902 --> 00:25:11.031
What did you say?

304
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:16.642
Is that really true?

305
00:25:16.842 --> 00:25:17.912
Of course.

306
00:25:18.842 --> 00:25:20.612
If I had plans...

307
00:25:21.281 --> 00:25:23.612
to include love in my life,

308
00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:26.912
Doctor Kwak would be on the other end.

309
00:25:27.821 --> 00:25:30.082
What do you mean?

310
00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:32.721
You should be relieved that...

311
00:25:33.221 --> 00:25:35.021
I'm not interested in love.

312
00:25:36.461 --> 00:25:39.092
Why aren't you interested in love?

313
00:25:39.231 --> 00:25:40.501
Must I explain?

314
00:25:42.531 --> 00:25:46.372
We aren't close enough for me to explain.

315
00:26:31.912 --> 00:26:34.021
- What's the current situation? - What happened?

316
00:26:34.082 --> 00:26:35.922
Will the patient survive?

317
00:26:37.592 --> 00:26:38.791
Please answer us.

318
00:26:44.031 --> 00:26:46.731
- How's the patient? - My goodness.

319
00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:48.662
- Are you okay? - Woo Jae.

320
00:26:48.662 --> 00:26:50.301
- Move out of the way. - Woo Jae.

321
00:26:50.301 --> 00:26:51.672
Wake up.

322
00:26:51.971 --> 00:26:55.571
About 12 were rescued, and 3 are missing.

323
00:26:55.902 --> 00:26:57.771
The search continues.

324
00:26:57.942 --> 00:27:00.882
We'll call and find out the details.

325
00:27:01.041 --> 00:27:02.382
Reporter Seo.

326
00:27:02.382 --> 00:27:05.082
- How much is it? - Today at 5pm...

327
00:27:05.082 --> 00:27:06.412
Are you drinking again?

328
00:27:06.412 --> 00:27:07.622
At the site...

329
00:27:07.622 --> 00:27:11.422
Why do you drink so much every day?

330
00:27:11.422 --> 00:27:12.422
How much is it?

331
00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:13.991
Just give me 10 dollars.

332
00:27:14.662 --> 00:27:16.521
Oh Hee Jung, a 42-year-old labor worker.

333
00:27:16.791 --> 00:27:20.862
