(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:10.733
I gave up on wanting to tell my story as I held on.

4
00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:14.374
But if I keep holding on,

5
00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:19.544
I felt like I would never be able to come back to my true self.

6
00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:26.414
Was it that wrong of me to do that?

7
00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:50.304
I was trying not to cry...

8
00:01:00.984 --> 00:01:03.113
I feel apologetic to you the most.

9
00:01:08.653 --> 00:01:10.024
You're drawing a line...

10
00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:13.763
even in this situation.

11
00:01:24.203 --> 00:01:26.004
Now, enough crying along with you.

12
00:01:27.774 --> 00:01:31.013
It's time for me to think about what I should do about this situation.

13
00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:32.284
But before I do,

14
00:01:32.713 --> 00:01:34.254
I need you to tell me your opinion on this.

15
00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:37.054
Are you sure you're not going to regret making this decision?

16
00:01:38.054 --> 00:01:40.593
This drama might do better after you quit.

17
00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:42.593
This happens a lot in this business.

18
00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:44.694
If you endure this,

19
00:01:45.394 --> 00:01:46.963
things might get easier next time.

20
00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:53.373
I might regret my decision.

21
00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:56.603
I might not be able to write again.

22
00:01:58.573 --> 00:02:01.314
But I still don't want to endure it. If I do,

23
00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:06.084
I think it's going to take me a million years to retrieve my pride.

24
00:02:10.483 --> 00:02:12.453
And after a million years, I'll no longer be here.

25
00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:16.863
I want to start writing again before I die.

26
00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:21.634
Okay.

27
00:02:22.263 --> 00:02:23.333
I'll drive you home.

28
00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:36.013
(Temperature of Love)

29
00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:38.543
- Good luck to us all! - Good luck to us all!

30
00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:40.353
Bottoms up.

31
00:02:40.353 --> 00:02:41.714
(Episode 15)

32
00:02:44.353 --> 00:02:46.384
I'd like to express my gratitude...

33
00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:48.453
for everyone's trust and support.

34
00:02:48.654 --> 00:02:50.624
Things have been so hectic for the past couple of days.

35
00:02:51.923 --> 00:02:53.994
Let's not get swayed by emotions, and keep our cool.

36
00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:56.393
I'll see you again after you guys take some rest for two days.

37
00:02:57.103 --> 00:02:58.803
Let's end the night with this last drink.

38
00:02:59.263 --> 00:03:00.434
- Good. - Soup.

39
00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:02.273
- We can do it! - We can do it!

40
00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:04.944
He's interpreting the dish in his own way.

41
00:03:04.944 --> 00:03:07.043
That's why it's a bit spicy.

42
00:03:08.474 --> 00:03:10.583
Everyone has priorities in life.

43
00:03:12.143 --> 00:03:13.814
She is a higher priority to me.

44
00:03:15.154 --> 00:03:17.124
Do I really like him?

45
00:03:18.423 --> 00:03:21.124
Or am I just obsessed with him because I got rejected by him?

46
00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:25.064
How many times am I watching this?

47
00:03:25.994 --> 00:03:27.164
Jung Sun.

48
00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:31.863
I love you with all my heart and soul.

49
00:03:32.134 --> 00:03:34.773
My gosh, what's wrong with you? You stink of sweat.

50
00:03:35.573 --> 00:03:36.643
You smell too.

51
00:03:36.643 --> 00:03:38.803
I know. That's why I'm not hugging you.

52
00:03:42.173 --> 00:03:43.244
(Hong Ah)

53
00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:44.613
Hey, it's Hong Ah.

54
00:03:45.143 --> 00:03:47.853
Now that you've rejected her, I'm finally getting my chance.

55
00:03:48.154 --> 00:03:49.483
You're incredible.

56
00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:51.184
Aren't you upset?

57
00:03:51.483 --> 00:03:53.793
My affection for her is too strong for me to feel upset.

58
00:03:54.154 --> 00:03:55.853
Do you have a woman who makes you feel this way?

59
00:03:58.293 --> 00:03:59.323
Hey, Hong Ah.

60
00:03:59.793 --> 00:04:00.863
I have someone like that too.

61
00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:05.333
(Missed Call: Lee Hyun Soo)

62
00:04:05.763 --> 00:04:06.833
She called me.

63
00:04:08.303 --> 00:04:10.374
(Lee Hyun Soo)

64
00:04:32.163 --> 00:04:33.934
Okay, I'll be right there.

65
00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:38.504
- The receiver cannot answer... - Is she not picking up?

66
00:04:38.634 --> 00:04:39.634
No.

67
00:04:40.273 --> 00:04:42.004
Hong Ah asked me to come over. I'll see you then.

68
00:04:42.004 --> 00:04:43.604
I'm also going to go see her even though she didn't ask me to.

69
00:04:43.744 --> 00:04:44.804
I thought she didn't pick up.

70
00:04:45.174 --> 00:04:47.544
I can't just go home on such a happy day.

71
00:04:47.744 --> 00:04:49.984
I'm at least going to go see if the lights are off at her place.

72
00:04:51.513 --> 00:04:53.143
How romantic.

73
00:04:53.614 --> 00:04:55.884
I'm going to go to your house, and take a shower before I go.

74
00:04:56.184 --> 00:04:57.523
I can't go in this filthy state.

75
00:04:58.884 --> 00:05:00.354
I'm just going to go like this.

76
00:05:03.494 --> 00:05:04.823
He's one confident fellow.

77
00:05:11.864 --> 00:05:13.434
You didn't have to get off.

78
00:05:15.703 --> 00:05:17.044
Thank you for today.

79
00:05:17.804 --> 00:05:21.143
"I'm sorry. I feel apologetic. Thank you."

80
00:05:22.073 --> 00:05:23.783
Don't ever say anything like that to me again.

81
00:05:24.884 --> 00:05:26.143
That's not what I want to hear.

82
00:05:26.884 --> 00:05:29.083
What I want to hear is a different response for my consideration...

83
00:05:30.124 --> 00:05:31.124
towards you.

84
00:05:33.494 --> 00:05:34.494
Mr. Park.

85
00:05:35.393 --> 00:05:37.364
Are you trying to approach me as a man?

86
00:05:39.934 --> 00:05:40.963
Yes.

87
00:05:46.703 --> 00:05:47.773
Thank you.

88
00:05:48.573 --> 00:05:50.104
You just gave me a good laugh.

89
00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:53.314
Good night.

90
00:06:43.763 --> 00:06:45.663
(Jung Sun)

91
00:06:47.634 --> 00:06:48.694
(Are you sleeping?)

92
00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:49.734
Are you sleeping?

93
00:06:51.903 --> 00:06:52.963
No.

94
00:06:53.634 --> 00:06:54.903
Do you want to meet?

95
00:06:57.573 --> 00:06:58.573
I'm scared.

96
00:06:59.573 --> 00:07:01.244
You pushed me away once.

97
00:07:01.744 --> 00:07:03.643
There's no reason why you wouldn't push me away again.

98
00:07:05.744 --> 00:07:08.554
Love requires two people, but I only thought of myself.

99
00:07:13.223 --> 00:07:14.554
I'll think about it.

100
00:07:19.593 --> 00:07:20.994
(Do you want to meet?)

101
00:07:20.994 --> 00:07:21.994
Where are you?

102
00:07:23.963 --> 00:07:25.033
I'm in the neighborhood.

103
00:07:30.374 --> 00:07:31.703
You surprised me.

104
00:07:32.044 --> 00:07:34.643
Then I succeeded. I was trying to surprise you.

105
00:07:35.643 --> 00:07:36.944
Why are you so happy?

106
00:07:37.384 --> 00:07:39.343
I drank with my Good Soup workers.

107
00:07:39.843 --> 00:07:41.854
The restaurant's packed with customers these days.

108
00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:46.794
My worst day turns out to be his best day.

109
00:07:47.523 --> 00:07:49.294
- I'll be right out. - No, don't come outside.

110
00:07:49.393 --> 00:07:50.963
It's too late. It's dangerous to come outside.

111
00:07:51.564 --> 00:07:52.794
Then do you want to come inside?

112
00:07:52.823 --> 00:07:55.434
No, I smell of sweat. I came right after exercising.

113
00:07:58.564 --> 00:07:59.663
Why did you call?

114
00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:03.304
I pressed the wrong button.

115
00:08:04.473 --> 00:08:06.174
You're attractive when you're honest.

116
00:08:06.343 --> 00:08:07.513
You just lost your charm.

117
00:08:11.143 --> 00:08:13.913
I saw your face, so I'll go now.

118
00:08:16.513 --> 00:08:17.884
People really don't change.

119
00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:21.593
I think the same goes for me.

120
00:08:25.163 --> 00:08:26.734
I thought I had changed.

121
00:08:27.663 --> 00:08:28.934
But I guess I was wrong.

122
00:08:31.933 --> 00:08:34.933
I don't wear my T-shirts inside out at home anymore.

123
00:08:35.004 --> 00:08:36.134
I got rid of that habit.

124
00:08:40.643 --> 00:08:41.714
The wind's cold.

125
00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:14.643
I despise stirring up emotions.

126
00:09:16.844 --> 00:09:19.313
I've never confused you.

127
00:09:19.313 --> 00:09:20.813
Why must I be the only one that assures you?

128
00:09:23.553 --> 00:09:25.653
Your problem is that you think too much,

129
00:09:26.954 --> 00:09:28.094
especially about love.

130
00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:31.563
Just do as your heart tells you.

131
00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:39.834
Hong Ah.

132
00:09:41.933 --> 00:09:43.403
Why did you make me wait?

133
00:09:43.403 --> 00:09:44.474
I took a shower.

134
00:09:45.173 --> 00:09:47.244
You're so foolish. Why did you take a shower when we're going to run?

135
00:09:47.443 --> 00:09:48.474
What?

136
00:09:50.484 --> 00:09:52.313
You can't call a fool foolish.

137
00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:15.303
I won.

138
00:10:16.134 --> 00:10:18.374
I'm going to win at everything.

139
00:10:21.813 --> 00:10:23.114
Aren't you going to pack your things?

140
00:10:23.114 --> 00:10:24.643
I can pack my own stuff.

141
00:10:24.913 --> 00:10:26.813
I thought we still had a week before having to move out.

142
00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:28.413
We still have some time.

143
00:10:28.854 --> 00:10:30.084
Where are you going to go?

144
00:10:30.454 --> 00:10:33.494
I'm going to live with my parents, and come to Seoul when I need to.

145
00:10:33.653 --> 00:10:36.293
Or I could just go live at my cousin's house.

146
00:10:38.324 --> 00:10:39.763
Do you want to live at my place?

147
00:10:41.793 --> 00:10:44.933
You were guaranteed a job until the end of this year.

148
00:10:46.464 --> 00:10:48.533
I don't want to burden you.

149
00:10:48.704 --> 00:10:50.673
You're not a burden.

150
00:10:50.673 --> 00:10:52.504
You should stay in Seoul if you want to keep writing.

151
00:10:52.504 --> 00:10:54.143
Especially if you're going to keep working as an assistant writer.

152
00:10:54.574 --> 00:10:55.913
Then I'll pay rent.

153
00:10:56.374 --> 00:10:58.844
Don't bother. You can just think of it as your own place.

154
00:10:59.783 --> 00:11:01.114
And you should start writing your own script.

155
00:11:01.584 --> 00:11:04.023
You can do some part-time jobs. It'd also be nice to be together.

156
00:11:05.754 --> 00:11:08.693
What's the point of writing? My work always fails to win competitions.

157
00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:10.793
I don't think I'm competent enough.

158
00:11:10.893 --> 00:11:12.893
No one knows that.

159
00:11:14.033 --> 00:11:16.033
I always doubted myself as well.

160
00:11:16.364 --> 00:11:19.163
Ms. Park told me that "The Man Who Eats Rare Steak" was terrible.

161
00:11:19.163 --> 00:11:21.933
But it won the competition. You were there too.

162
00:11:22.303 --> 00:11:23.374
You're right.

163
00:11:24.903 --> 00:11:27.214
Everything has its own right time. Your time will come.

164
00:11:27.744 --> 00:11:29.013
You just need to wait.

165
00:11:30.443 --> 00:11:32.513
Hyun Soo, you're the best.

166
00:11:32.913 --> 00:11:34.584
What should we eat for lunch?

167
00:11:37.084 --> 00:11:39.084
He's almost done with the dish.

168
00:11:39.084 --> 00:11:40.153
It smells great.

169
00:11:40.153 --> 00:11:43.594
Yes, it does. I'll go and have a taste.

170
00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:45.793
He's cooking bouillabaisse right now.

171
00:11:46.693 --> 00:11:49.364
I wonder how it'll taste.

172
00:11:50.533 --> 00:11:51.604
Why did you turn it off?

173
00:11:51.864 --> 00:11:53.834
You're so handsome.

174
00:11:54.033 --> 00:11:56.273
You're more handsome than most actors.

175
00:11:57.374 --> 00:12:00.173
Don't eat it yet. Wait until I give you the soup.

176
00:12:05.384 --> 00:12:06.813
I'm so jealous that you're young.

177
00:12:08.484 --> 00:12:10.984
You have a great future ahead of you.

178
00:12:11.454 --> 00:12:15.023
Do you know how proud I was in front of Daniel?

179
00:12:15.094 --> 00:12:16.393
You come to Seoul really often these days.

180
00:12:17.224 --> 00:12:19.124
That's because Daniel comes to Seoul often.

181
00:12:22.693 --> 00:12:23.864
You didn't season it right.

182
00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:25.864
I'm sure I did.

183
00:12:26.063 --> 00:12:28.834
Your taste buds aren't the same when you grow old.

184
00:12:29.803 --> 00:12:31.443
I'm not that old.

185
00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:33.874
But everything else tastes great.

186
00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:37.913
You're a great person.

187
00:12:38.813 --> 00:12:40.614
Thank you for being born as my son.

188
00:12:47.653 --> 00:12:48.653
Where are you going?

189
00:12:48.653 --> 00:12:50.393
It's my day off, so I'm going to slack off.

190
00:12:50.763 --> 00:12:52.624
Can't you spend some time with me?

191
00:12:52.893 --> 00:12:53.994
Do you want to go shopping?

192
00:12:53.994 --> 00:12:55.334
You can go with Mr. Min.

193
00:12:55.464 --> 00:12:57.663
Can't you call him Professor Min?

194
00:12:57.663 --> 00:12:59.663
Do I need to call him that when he's not even here?

195
00:13:02.104 --> 00:13:05.244
Professor Min makes me happy.

196
00:13:05.874 --> 00:13:07.513
So please be nice to him.

197
00:13:08.374 --> 00:13:11.484
Someone told me that happiness comes from within.

198
00:13:11.584 --> 00:13:13.183
It doesn't come from someone else.

199
00:13:13.754 --> 00:13:15.413
It's time for you to grow up.

200
00:13:17.884 --> 00:13:19.124
I don't want to grow up.

201
00:13:19.994 --> 00:13:21.754
I've always lived my life like this. If I suddenly grow up,

202
00:13:22.053 --> 00:13:24.824
I'll suddenly feel too embarrassed of my past.

203
00:13:26.393 --> 00:13:27.763
You're so good with words.

204
00:13:37.244 --> 00:13:40.413
Hyun Soo, you seem awfully fine.

205
00:13:40.874 --> 00:13:42.374
It's difficult to come to a decision.

206
00:13:44.143 --> 00:13:45.844
But I've already made up my mind.

207
00:13:46.214 --> 00:13:48.413
You're really incredible.

208
00:13:48.584 --> 00:13:50.923
As soon as you make a decision, you just go for it.

209
00:13:52.354 --> 00:13:53.793
Let's go on a trip.

210
00:13:54.193 --> 00:13:55.653
You worked hard until now.

211
00:13:55.653 --> 00:13:59.624
Should I think of a place that's great for our current situation?

212
00:13:59.624 --> 00:14:00.634
Yes.

213
00:14:01.193 --> 00:14:04.403
The place where General Yi Sun Shin wrote "War Diary".

214
00:14:04.504 --> 00:14:05.504
- Yeosu! - Yeosu!

215
00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:06.933
We said the same thing!

216
00:14:07.874 --> 00:14:09.433
I'll look for a place to stay.

217
00:14:09.533 --> 00:14:10.604
Okay.

218
00:14:11.574 --> 00:14:13.744
My gosh, it's Director Kim.

219
00:14:13.913 --> 00:14:16.714
We shouldn't have told him the passcode in the first place.

220
00:14:16.884 --> 00:14:18.813
Hi, guys. What's that? Are you eating instant noodles?

221
00:14:18.913 --> 00:14:20.313
This is all we have.

222
00:14:21.283 --> 00:14:22.313
Hey, Ms. Hwangbo.

223
00:14:22.354 --> 00:14:23.984
Don't even think about asking her to do anything.

224
00:14:23.984 --> 00:14:25.954
Why do you keep asking her for favors?

225
00:14:25.984 --> 00:14:27.994
In my opinion, you need to start dating someone.

226
00:14:28.124 --> 00:14:29.324
You're so emotionally dry.

227
00:14:29.324 --> 00:14:31.023
How long has it been since you last dated anyone?

228
00:14:31.023 --> 00:14:32.594
What does dating have anything to do with this?

229
00:14:32.594 --> 00:14:34.693
Anyone would say that considering your temperament.

230
00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:36.393
What about Hyun Soo's temperament?

231
00:14:36.393 --> 00:14:38.263
It's a hundred times better than yours.

232
00:14:38.334 --> 00:14:41.604
Go! You're the Unit B director of "Unruly Detectives".

233
00:14:41.604 --> 00:14:43.033
How could you come here?

234
00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:44.043
You go girl!

235
00:14:44.273 --> 00:14:45.943
How funny.

236

Jung Woo is having trouble with the network because of you.

237
00:14:51.513 --> 00:14:53.653
You're making this difficult, Mr. Park.

238
00:14:53.754 --> 00:14:56.153
You can't try to renegotiate the budget.

239
00:14:56.413 --> 00:14:59.754
You wanted me to sign the new writers team.

240
00:14:59.754 --> 00:15:01.893
The production company should cover that.

241
00:15:01.893 --> 00:15:03.893
Do you know how much we lost when our writer got fired?

242
00:15:03.893 --> 00:15:07.364
She wasn't fired. Writer Lee said she'd quit.

243
00:15:07.464 --> 00:15:10.663
Production companies sign with writers and then work with networks.

244
00:15:11.033 --> 00:15:12.903
What writer would want to work with us...

245
00:15:13.303 --> 00:15:15.433
if they hear we can't protect our own writers?

246
00:15:15.673 --> 00:15:18.574
Anyways, this issue is beyond me.

247
00:15:18.903 --> 00:15:20.474

I knew this would happen.

251
00:15:30.484 --> 00:15:33.724
Writer Lee Hyun Soo had to drop out due to health concerns.

252
00:15:35.594 --> 00:15:36.893
As if.

253
00:15:41.293 --> 00:15:44.734
My skin's gotten dry pulling all those all-nighters.

- Yes. - I was right.

259
00:16:08.423 --> 00:16:10.563
I said Hyun Soo would get fired.

260
00:16:10.964 --> 00:16:12.124
What are you going to do?

261
00:16:12.124 --> 00:16:14.793
She didn't get fired. She quit.

262
00:16:15.094 --> 00:16:17.634
Quitting or getting fired. It's basically the same thing.

263
00:16:17.634 --> 00:16:20.604
It's not the same. Quitting was her choice.

264
00:16:21.874 --> 00:16:23.134
She's doing well.

265
00:16:23.134 --> 00:16:25.773
You know her. She goes head on once she makes a decision.

Hyun Soo wants to live with me.

270
00:16:34.884 --> 00:16:37.824
That's burdening her. Why would you move in to her place?

271
00:16:37.923 --> 00:16:39.854
That's none of your business.

272

You can live a good life on your own.

I'm going to live with Hyun Soo. Bye.

I told you she wouldn't be downhearted.

Hyun Yi went to her in-laws. She's dropping Bo Ra off there.

00:17:28.203 --> 00:17:30.643
She should bring Bo Ra. I don't need Hyun Yi here.

It's better that you have Hyun Yi for when we're no longer around.

Let's take something for your headache.

328
00:19:54.084 --> 00:19:55.784
I don't like taking pills.

329
00:19:55.784 --> 00:19:57.524
I guess I have to take one since you're telling me to.

330
00:19:58.483 --> 00:19:59.993
I like that you always listen to me.

331
00:20:01.753 --> 00:20:03.264
Let's go eat something good for dinner.

332
00:20:03.624 --> 00:20:05.764
Yes, let's go somewhere nice.

333
00:20:06.094 --> 00:20:07.794
There are a lot of good restaurants in this neighborhood.

334
00:20:09.433 --> 00:20:11.804
I know a good place. Let's go there.

335
00:20:15.203 --> 00:20:16.604
We saw profit this month.

336
00:20:20.114 --> 00:20:22.673
So Good Soup is on its way to success?

337
00:20:22.844 --> 00:20:26.243
I won't have to worry about letting the employees go at least.

338
00:20:26.713 --> 00:20:27.814
I should get going.

339
00:20:28.554 --> 00:20:30.423
What are you doing tomorrow? You're off tomorrow too.

340
00:20:30.753 --> 00:20:31.854
I don't have plans.

341
00:20:32.753 --> 00:20:34.094
Let's hang out. It's been a while.

342
00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:36.963
Shouldn't you hang out with the person you're going to propose to?

343
00:20:40.134 --> 00:20:41.794
She's not in a situation to do that right now.

344
00:20:42.264 --> 00:20:45.703
Is she even real? I've never seen you with someone.

345
00:20:46.104 --> 00:20:48.173
I always do those things alone.

346
00:20:49.233 --> 00:20:50.604
Just get ready to greet her.

347
00:20:51.344 --> 00:20:52.604
I'll look forward to it.

348
00:20:53.473 --> 00:20:54.614
But where are you going now?

349
00:20:54.874 --> 00:20:57.814
Writer Lee Hyun Soo. She's dropping out of "Unruly Detectives".

350
00:20:57.913 --> 00:20:59.884
I'm very busy sorting that out.

351
00:21:02.054 --> 00:21:03.653
You guys decided on that in the end?

352
00:21:03.753 --> 00:21:05.983
Yes. That's what she decided.

353
00:21:06.594 --> 00:21:07.624
I'm taking off.

354
00:21:19.003 --> 00:21:21.074
(Restaurant closed.)

355
00:21:21.074 --> 00:21:22.774
(Restaurant closed on every Sunday and Monday.)

356
00:21:24.943 --> 00:21:27.143
This is where I wanted to take you guys.

357
00:21:29.544 --> 00:21:30.544
Good Soup?

358
00:21:31.044 --> 00:21:32.284
What a pretty name.

359
00:21:33.014 --> 00:21:34.753
Why did they have to close today?

360
00:21:34.953 --> 00:21:36.624
I know.

361
00:21:37.453 --> 00:21:38.653
It doesn't suit us.

362
00:21:38.653 --> 00:21:41.723
That's not true. You have no logic.

363
00:21:41.723 --> 00:21:43.893
What does logic have to do here?

364
00:21:43.893 --> 00:21:45.824
Why can't I think like that?

365
00:21:46.663 --> 00:21:50.304
You always make me mad even when I try to be nice.

366
00:21:50.403 --> 00:21:53.163
When have you ever tried to be nice?

367
00:21:53.703 --> 00:21:54.703
Stop it.

368
00:21:55.703 --> 00:21:58.243
Seeing your children fight in front of your eyes...

369
00:21:58.903 --> 00:22:00.374
is the most upsetting thing as a parent.

370
00:22:02.913 --> 00:22:04.213
I'm sorry, dad.

371
00:22:04.213 --> 00:22:05.614
I'm sorry, dad.

372
00:22:06.243 --> 00:22:07.413
(Restaurant closed.)

373
00:22:07.784 --> 00:22:09.054
- Let's go somewhere else. - Let's go somewhere else.

374
00:22:09.054 --> 00:22:10.054
Let's go.

375
00:22:26.003 --> 00:22:28.274
You're such a workaholic. It's our day off.

376
00:22:29.403 --> 00:22:31.203
- What's that? - Brine.

377
00:22:31.443 --> 00:22:33.044
Brining normally takes too long.

378
00:22:34.814 --> 00:22:36.743
You exceed me, Sous-chef.

379
00:22:36.943 --> 00:22:38.544
It's nothing, Chef.

380
00:22:39.743 --> 00:22:42.384
But you can make knife marks. Do you need the syringe?

381
00:22:42.483 --> 00:22:44.854
The syringe speeds it up and evens it out.

382
00:22:46.024 --> 00:22:49.024
I guess if you make holes, the seasoning seeps in better.

383
00:22:49.223 --> 00:22:50.223
You're quick.

384
00:22:50.594 --> 00:22:53.124
And it also lets the fat seep out more.

385
00:22:54.393 --> 00:22:55.493
Who are you making this for?

386
00:22:56.463 --> 00:22:57.733
I asked Hong Ah to come.

387
00:22:59.433 --> 00:23:01.534
Don't hate her too much.

388
00:23:02.074 --> 00:23:04.643
I know she's self-centered and selfish.

389
00:23:05.074 --> 00:23:07.544
She's too focused on her own desires to be considerate of others.

390
00:23:08.443 --> 00:23:10.943
Why would I hate her? It's none of my business.

391
00:23:11.943 --> 00:23:13.413
Love takes many forms.

392
00:23:14.453 --> 00:23:16.753
You and Hyun Soo aren't normal either.

393
00:23:19.423 --> 00:23:21.723
I want her to be in a normal relationship.

394
00:23:21.824 --> 00:23:24.893
Me too. I want that for Hyun Soo.

395
00:23:25.864 --> 00:23:27.663
You don't have to worry about Hyun Soo.

396
00:23:27.663 --> 00:23:30.134
She's the type to check again and again.

397
00:23:30.463 --> 00:23:31.634
She can't make mistakes.

398
00:23:33.334 --> 00:23:34.374
You're right.

399
00:23:35.034 --> 00:23:37.443
I get to retire next year.

400
00:23:37.544 --> 00:23:38.804
I don't have much time left.

401
00:23:39.804 --> 00:23:41.344
Let's just wait a bit more and hang in there.

402
00:23:41.643 --> 00:23:44.314
We get a pension, and we can collect our savings.

403
00:23:44.643 --> 00:23:46.114
All that's left is to have fun.

404
00:23:46.114 --> 00:23:47.514
If it's with you,

405
00:23:48.213 --> 00:23:50.084
waiting is fun too.

406
00:23:52.524 --> 00:23:54.524
Everyone said it wasn't good,

407
00:23:54.524 --> 00:23:56.253
but I enjoyed "Unruly Detectives".

408
00:23:56.993 --> 00:23:58.024
I could sympathize.

409
00:23:58.723 --> 00:24:00.034
It's about us.

410
00:24:00.534 --> 00:24:02.864
Right? It is about us, right?

411
00:24:04.634 --> 00:24:07.733
But hey, am I really that mean?

412
00:24:08.134 --> 00:24:10.203
Betraying his own brother for his career...

413
00:24:10.203 --> 00:24:12.544
If you were in the situation, you'd do the same without hesitation.

414
00:24:13.844 --> 00:24:15.713
But the director was bad at that.

415
00:24:16.274 --> 00:24:18.044
He didn't know how to build up the story.

416
00:24:18.284 --> 00:24:20.354
The theme seems to sibling love.

417
00:24:20.354 --> 00:24:22.983
But he shot it as an action show. All they do is fight and crash.

418
00:24:23.423 --> 00:24:24.723
I like you.

419
00:24:25.524 --> 00:24:27.524
I can almost forget all the horrible things you did to me.

420
00:24:27.753 --> 00:24:28.753
Horrible things?

421
00:24:29.124 --> 00:24:30.564
What an awful word to use.

422
00:24:32.024 --> 00:24:35.334
Just know that your family will always be...

423
00:24:35.364 --> 00:24:36.903
the last people standing for you.

424
00:24:43.243 --> 00:24:46.304
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

425
00:24:53.683 --> 00:24:54.884
Jung Woo, I'm here.

426
00:24:56.384 --> 00:24:57.423
You're here early.

427
00:24:57.923 --> 00:24:58.983
Didn't you shoot the drama today?

428
00:24:59.584 --> 00:25:01.723
We're not shooting tomorrow either. The script isn't ready yet.

429
00:25:02.153 --> 00:25:04.223
I'm sure it's not easy to continue what someone else had started.

430
00:25:04.893 --> 00:25:05.893
Why did you ask to see me?

431
00:25:07.064 --> 00:25:08.094
Have you ever read this script?

432
00:25:08.094 --> 00:25:09.134
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

433
00:25:09.834 --> 00:25:11.903
It's written by Hyun Soo.

434
00:25:12.104 --> 00:25:13.304
I heard about it.

435
00:25:14.173 --> 00:25:15.574
The main character is a chef,

436
00:25:15.574 --> 00:25:17.374
and Kind Soup is his online nickname.

437
00:25:17.774 --> 00:25:19.304
She wrote this before she wrote "Unruly Detectives".

438
00:25:19.304 --> 00:25:20.443
I like this one.

439
00:25:21.774 --> 00:25:23.284
I should produce a drama with this script.

440
00:25:23.483 --> 00:25:24.943
Isn't this a melodrama?

441
00:25:25.314 --> 00:25:26.884
I think I told you to forgot it.

442
00:25:27.953 --> 00:25:30.084
But this one has its own unique color.

443
00:25:30.784 --> 00:25:32.824
I think it would do well on a cable channel.

444
00:25:34.124 --> 00:25:37.294
You're really incredible. I'm so moved by your efforts.

445
00:25:38.024 --> 00:25:40.893
You stayed by the side of a woman who's not interested in you,

446
00:25:40.893 --> 00:25:42.134
and opened up opportunities for her.

447
00:25:42.693 --> 00:25:45.134
Jung Woo, can't you do the same for me too?

448
00:25:46.334 --> 00:25:47.834
Why are you so talkative?

449
00:25:50.903 --> 00:25:52.874
I want to direct this.

450
00:25:54.173 --> 00:25:55.874
Your work is really difficult to understand.

451
00:25:56.213 --> 00:25:59.183
That's because I never chose what I wanted to direct.

452
00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:00.713
I just directed what the upper management told me to.

453
00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:02.653
I want to direct this. Let me direct this.

454
00:26:02.884 --> 00:26:04.453
I want to try working with Hyun Soo.

455
00:26:11.163 --> 00:26:12.764
(Director Kim Joon Ha)

456
00:26:15.493 --> 00:26:16.663
Hey, Director Kim.

457
00:26:17.433 --> 00:26:18.503
How have you been?

458
00:26:20.233 --> 00:26:22.074
Just get to the point.

459
00:26:22.134 --> 00:26:23.874
You don't need to be formal and ask me how I'm doing.

460
00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:26.614
My gosh, why are you so cold?

461
00:26:26.614 --> 00:26:28.514
Your making me heart ache even more.

462
00:26:29.143 --> 00:26:31.183
Did you just say I made your heart ache even more?

463
00:26:31.913 --> 00:26:34.314
I can't believe you still use that pick up line.

464
00:26:34.453 --> 00:26:36.753
Why would I even try to seduce you?

465
00:26:36.884 --> 00:26:39.384
I'm not saying you're trying to seduce me.

466
00:26:39.854 --> 00:26:42.094
I'm just saying you're used to using pick-up lines all the time.

467
00:26:42.153 --> 00:26:44.463
Okay, whatever. I'm on my way to your studio right now.

468
00:26:44.594 --> 00:26:46.364
I'm going to barge in, so don't be surprised.

469
00:26:46.524 --> 00:26:49.733
Do whatever you want. I'm not there anyway.

470
00:26:50.534 --> 00:26:51.733
Are you with Hyun Soo right now?

471
00:26:52.233 --> 00:26:54.703
She just went outside saying that she needs to clear her head.

472
00:26:54.973 --> 00:26:57.074
Hyun Soo and I aren't going to be in Seoul starting from tomorrow.

473
00:27:09.054 --> 00:27:10.054
How does it taste?

474
00:27:11.453 --> 00:27:12.453
It's delicious.

475
00:27:12.653 --> 00:27:14.693
It's crispy on the outside, and it's moist on the inside.

476
00:27:14.693 --> 00:27:15.953
The texture is also great.

477
00:27:17.094 --> 00:27:19.463
Chef, I'll always be loyal to you.

478
00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:27.834
You're here.

479
00:27:28.134 --> 00:27:29.574
What's he doing here?

480
00:27:30.044 --> 00:27:32.874
You called me over to give me food, but I'm about to lose my appetite.

481
00:27:34.143 --> 00:27:36.344
I'll leave now, so that you can save your appetite.

482
00:27:36.743 --> 00:27:39.014
Since when were you so considerate?

483
00:27:39.713 --> 00:27:40.814
Just focus on what you need to.

484
00:27:40.814 --> 00:27:43.683
Hong Ah, you're really good at criticizing people.

485
00:27:43.683 --> 00:27:45.423
I'm not criticizing anyone. I'm just stating the facts.

486
00:27:47.324 --> 00:27:48.824
Do you know that Hyun Soo got fired?

487
00:27:48.993 --> 00:27:50.864
Her career might've just ended.

488
00:27:51.524 --> 00:27:52.564
Is it that bad?

489
00:27:52.663 --> 00:27:54.134
She's not persistent at all.

490
00:27:54.294 --> 00:27:57.264
She went through so much to get to where she is right now.

491
00:27:57.604 --> 00:28:00.733
Someone might think you actually care for her.

492
00:28:02.074 --> 00:28:04.844
You must be upset now that she's in a bad situation.

493
00:28:05.574 --> 00:28:08.374
I hope you suffer a lot because of her.

494
00:28:09.243 --> 00:28:12.913
Okay. I'll fulfill your wish and suffer a lot because of her.

495
00:28:13.554 --> 00:28:15.153
I'll also love her a lot as well.

496
00:28:34.774 --> 00:28:35.774
What's your name?

497
00:28:36.433 --> 00:28:38.774
I'm going to turn down your offer.

498
00:28:39.473 --> 00:28:40.473
Will you wait for me?

499
00:28:41.473 --> 00:28:43.114
Love is so meaningless.

500
00:28:43.443 --> 00:28:46.213
I can't waste my youth on something like that.

501
00:28:47.384 --> 00:28:48.784
I won't go if you tell me not to go.

502
00:28:49.354 --> 00:28:52.054
You don't need to put a meaning behind an irresponsible kiss.

503
00:28:52.524 --> 00:28:54.524
I wasn't being clingy.

504
00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:55.524
(On Jung Sun)

505
00:28:57.923 --> 00:28:59.163
I'm not going to pick up.

506
00:29:00.034 --> 00:29:02.294
I didn't know you were so rash.

507
00:29:02.534 --> 00:29:04.834
How could I check with you when you didn't even pick up my call?

508
00:29:04.834 --> 00:29:06.874
When did I not pick up?

509
00:29:10.344 --> 00:29:11.844
You didn't think you'd get rejected, did you?

510
00:29:11.903 --> 00:29:14.114
Do you think everything will be fine if you tell me that you regret it?

511
00:29:14.314 --> 00:29:16.243
You can't turn back time.

512
00:29:16.243 --> 00:29:18.284
Do you think I had fun during that time?

513
00:29:30.993 --> 00:29:32.723
You'll get tired if you take a break.

514
00:29:32.923 --> 00:29:34.433
You need to force yourself to keep running.

515
00:29:34.933 --> 00:29:35.933
I know that.

516
00:29:36.604 --> 00:29:37.733
If you know, you need to put that into action.

517
00:29:37.834 --> 00:29:38.933
- Okay. - Keep running.

518
00:29:39.064 --> 00:29:40.733
If your legs feel too heavy,

519
00:29:41.074 --> 00:29:42.534
you should consciously move your arms.

520
00:29:42.534 --> 00:29:44.344
- Like this? - Yes, that's great.

521
00:29:44.473 --> 00:29:45.544
Now, go forward.

522
00:29:46.203 --> 00:29:48.213
Gosh, I'm sorry. You can go first. I'll go by myself.

523
00:29:49.413 --> 00:29:51.344
It's a great day to commit murder.

524
00:29:51.544 --> 00:29:52.814
Who are you going to murder?

525
00:29:53.183 --> 00:29:54.614
It's the homework I got from the main writer.

526
00:29:56.453 --> 00:29:57.453
Do you want to go out with me?

527
00:29:58.284 --> 00:30:00.054
My gosh, you startled me.

528
00:30:00.324 --> 00:30:02.453
It's nothing compared to how startled I was.

529
00:30:02.524 --> 00:30:03.993
Why are you angry at me?

530
00:30:03.993 --> 00:30:05.193
Because it's you.

531
00:30:05.193 --> 00:30:07.594
Why are you angry at me? And why are you teasing me?

532
00:30:07.663 --> 00:30:10.564
I almost hugged you because I was so happy to see you.

533
00:30:27.983 --> 00:30:29.514
You're incredible.

534
00:30:30.683 --> 00:30:32.324
How did you manage to break through this wall?

535
00:30:38.094 --> 00:30:40.364
I promise that I'll live like you.

536
00:31:00.014 --> 00:31:02.753
- Why aren't you sleeping yet? - My gosh.

537
00:31:04.453 --> 00:31:06.024
It's not time for me to sleep yet.

538
00:31:07.124 --> 00:31:08.423
You seem okay.

539
00:31:09.124 --> 00:31:10.463
There's no reason for me not to be okay.

540
00:31:11.423 --> 00:31:12.594
I saw the article.

541
00:31:14.393 --> 00:31:18.104
"Writer Lee Hyun Soo had to drop out due to health concerns."

542
00:31:18.804 --> 00:31:20.233
You talk as if it has nothing to do with you.

543
00:31:20.403 --> 00:31:21.903
It doesn't have anything to do with me anymore.

544
00:31:23.203 --> 00:31:25.044
It's always hard to come to a decision.

545
00:31:25.143 --> 00:31:27.274
But once I do, I never turn back.

546
00:31:28.443 --> 00:31:30.084
It seems like you're going through a rough time,

547
00:31:30.183 --> 00:31:31.683
so I'll bear with the boasting.

548
00:31:38.483 --> 00:31:39.923
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

549
00:31:41.054 --> 00:31:42.124
With... With whom?

550
00:31:43.153 --> 00:31:45.564
With Kyung. You saw her once.

551
00:31:49.034 --> 00:31:51.703
She went through a lot while working with me.

552
00:31:52.034 --> 00:31:53.304
I want to show her a good time.

553
00:32:13.354 --> 00:32:14.753
(On Jung Sun)

554
00:32:15.953 --> 00:32:16.993
Hey.

555
00:32:17.564 --> 00:32:20.134
Jung Woo, can I cancel on our appointment tomorrow?

556
00:32:21.064 --> 00:32:23.804
You're making it hard for me to refuse.

557
00:32:24.334 --> 00:32:25.364
I'm sorry.

558
00:32:25.604 --> 00:32:28.574
I asked you out in a really long time, but you just rejected me.

559
00:32:28.733 --> 00:32:30.274
Are you doing this because you've become a hot shot?

560
00:32:31.003 --> 00:32:32.844
I'll pay you back tenfold.

561
00:32:33.413 --> 00:32:35.114
You better.

562
00:32:42.713 --> 00:32:44.183
What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving.

563
00:32:44.183 --> 00:32:45.223
Sit down.

564
00:32:47.824 --> 00:32:50.193
Jung Woo, it's time to take action.

565
00:32:50.294 --> 00:32:51.663
You've been watching her for too long.

566
00:32:52.124 --> 00:32:55.064
Hyun Soo probably wants you to make the first move.

567
00:32:55.893 --> 00:32:57.304
I don't agree with you.

568
00:32:57.304 --> 00:32:58.804
My gosh, trust me on this.

569
00:32:59.163 --> 00:33:00.203
What are you doing tomorrow?

570
00:33:01.034 --> 00:33:03.173
My appointment for tomorrow just got canceled.

571
00:33:04.503 --> 00:33:05.574
This is fate.

572
00:33:06.003 --> 00:33:09.544
I'll be the bridge to help you and Hyun Soo get together.

573
00:33:10.314 --> 00:33:12.544
Can you be clear, so that I can understand?

574
00:33:13.354 --> 00:33:15.054
I'm saying we should meet Hyun Soo tomorrow.

575
00:33:15.153 --> 00:33:16.653
Let's meet her accidentally on purpose.

576
00:33:22.393 --> 00:33:25.564
(Episode 16 will air shortly.)
