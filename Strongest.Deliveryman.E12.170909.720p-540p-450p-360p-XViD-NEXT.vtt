<i>[Episode 12]</i>

3
00:00:09.662 --> 00:00:10.830
It's nice to meet you.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.832
I've heard about you.

5
00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:15.835
Yes, I've heard a lot about you too.

6
00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:18.597
Could you clear the way for us?

7
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.841
I'm sorry, but we're on our way
to make a delivery.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.820
Couldn't you yield
for us first instead?

9
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:26.704
I'm sorry, but the word "yield"
doesn't exist in my vocabulary.

10
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.848
And I'm no good at
going back, either.

11
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.842
You sure are brimming with confidence.

12
00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:37.534
But to me, you seem like you
have a lot to learn.

13
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.550
I'm learning quite a bit from those
who I deem qualified to teach me.

14
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.864
Please step aside, already.
The food will get cold.

15
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.390
Someone who's in the restaurant
business should respect that much.

16
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:51.794
That's right, food should be
eaten while it's still warm.

17
00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:55.276
It's clear that the so-called food you're
delivering hardly qualifies as food.

18
00:00:55.276 --> 00:00:57.794
So it'll be truly inedible if
it's cold, to boot.

19
00:00:57.794 --> 00:00:59.239
Go on now, then.

20
00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.416
All right.

21
00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:01.790
Until next time, then.

22
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.181
Until next time.

23
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.870
We should get going now, too.

24
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.387
Go prepare for the lunch rush.

25
00:01:25.387 --> 00:01:26.387
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

26
00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:27.638
Do your best.

27
00:01:27.638 --> 00:01:32.864
Make it so that every single
customer here eats at our restaurants.

28
00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:34.277
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

29
00:01:38.643 --> 00:01:41.507
Ugh, look at that piece of work!

30
00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:43.816
She pisses me off so much!

31
00:01:45.598 --> 00:01:47.891
I don't feel pissed.
I just feel defeated.

32
00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:49.140
What do you mean?

33
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.631
Tell her that it's on, then!

34
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:53.619
I've been running my business
here for 20 years now!

35
00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.559
I won't go under overnight!

36
00:01:55.559 --> 00:02:00.184
What makes you so sure of that?
I'm scared out of my wits, here.

37
00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:01.961
- We have Kang Soo, though!
- What?

38
00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:04.958
Hanyang hung in there for so long,
all thanks to Kang Soo.

39
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.535
If we join forces with him,
we can get through this, too!

40
00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:12.001
You think Kang Soo is the guardian angel
of this street, or something?

41
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.078
You think he isn't, then?

42
00:02:13.078 --> 00:02:16.087
You're not going to join forces
with Kang Soo, then, Mr. Choi?

43
00:02:16.087 --> 00:02:19.964
I never said I wasn't.
I'm just saying.

44
00:02:19.964 --> 00:02:22.618
Yes, I understand.
We will come visit you soon.

45
00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:25.505
Was that someone
who wanted to partner with us?

46
00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:26.520
Yeah.

47
00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:31.866
Are you confident?

48
00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:33.854
- Yeah.
- Why are you so confident, though?

49
00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:37.445
I'm wearing these.

50
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.417
- Let's go.
- Yes, CEO Choi.

so we would appreciate it if you
took the stairs to the lower floors.

Hello! I'm here to make a delivery!

94
00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:18.760
What about Kang Soo?

95
00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:24.608
He's currently delivering a bowl
of Jeonju-style hangover stew.

96
00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:26.594
- What about Dan Ah?
- Just a moment.

97
00:05:28.346 --> 00:05:30.596
She is currently making a delivery
for Dami Restaurant.

98
00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:32.650
Can't I have those two deliver food
for only Lively Handmade?

99
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.573
No, we can't do that.

100
00:05:34.573 --> 00:05:38.930
The company has grown larger, we can't
set exclusive deliverymen for places.

101
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.116
Our company's system is to
send employees who aren't busy

102
00:05:41.116 --> 00:05:44.563
to make deliveries, in order,
when orders come in.

Are you the CEO?

104

I'm a director.

105
00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:49.270
So you could call me the
second-in-command.

106
00:05:50.596 --> 00:05:52.490
Here's the sweet and sour pork!

Yes, sir!

108
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:01.924
All right, then.

Where do you guys usually eat?

110
00:06:04.171 --> 00:06:06.998

- Yes, sir!

What are you planning to do for lunch?

123
00:06:47.264 --> 00:06:49.299
The owner of Dami Restaurant
told me to come and eat there.

124

What about you, Boss?

125
00:06:50.337 --> 00:06:52.856
The owner of Jeonju Hangover Soup
asked me to eat with them.

136
00:07:22.495 --> 00:07:24.399
Yeah. I don't know if it's
because I'm nervous

but I didn't even feel hungry.

00:09:03.822 --> 00:09:05.730
- No!
- Why would you leave?

163
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.975
I feel like I should go, though.

164
00:09:07.975 --> 00:09:10.305
- It's fine.
- Yeah, just stay.

165
00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:27.350
I think I really should go.

166
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.543
I told you, it's fine!

167
00:09:28.543 --> 00:09:29.829
Yeah, finish that before you go.

168
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:34.755
No, I feel like this is torture
for all of us.

169
00:09:35.504 --> 00:09:37.650
Enjoy your sausage, Ms. Dan Ah.

170
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.266
Um... okay.

171
00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:40.360
You too, Mister.

172
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.708
Um... okay.
Sure.

173
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.265
Goodbye.

174
00:09:58.669 --> 00:10:01.617
Goodbye, Mister!

175
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.749
I'll be coming to this location
often from now on.

176
00:10:13.749 --> 00:10:15.187
Yes, CEO Jung.

177
00:10:18.274 --> 00:10:21.702
How much did Hanyang steal from us
in sales, because of delivery?

178
00:10:21.702 --> 00:10:24.515
It was about one-tenths of
our sales in the beginning.

179
00:10:24.515 --> 00:10:27.808
But it kept rising, and it was
one-fifth of our sales at one point.

180
00:10:27.808 --> 00:10:29.763
They managed that, just with delivery?

181
00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:31.053
It wasn't only delivery, ma'am.

182
00:10:31.053 --> 00:10:34.061
They hung in there by making deliveries
and using other alternative strategies.

183
00:10:34.061 --> 00:10:36.072
They even lured away some of
our big groups of customers

184
00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:39.649
and stole away some of our customers
because of our wait times.

185
00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:41.981
I'm sure they're planning to use the
same strategy this time, too.

186
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:44.164
They'll hang in there through
doing delivery orders

187
00:10:44.164 --> 00:10:45.986
and stealing away queued-up customers.

188
00:10:45.986 --> 00:10:46.986
Yes.

189
00:10:46.986 --> 00:10:48.992
Think of a counterstrategy.

190
00:10:48.992 --> 00:10:52.939
You know about Jung Family Foods'
ultimate strategy, right?

191
00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:54.967
To suppress the nearby restaurants
within six months

192
00:10:54.967 --> 00:10:58.408
and then stabilizing our prices
to make the most profits we can.

193
00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.381
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

194
00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:01.559
Yes, CEO Jung.

195
00:11:04.073 --> 00:11:05.649
Don't see me out, and take care
of balancing the checkbooks.

196
00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:07.829
Yes, ma'am.
Goobye, CEO Jung.

You're a CEO now.

You have twelve employees,

travelling all over Seoul?

218

And yet, you've given up on that and
are staying here, so it's obvious.

00:12:47.811 --> 00:12:50.213
Um, yeah.
Things just ended up like that.

229
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.654

Sure.

Don't come in starting tomorrow, Mother.

232

leave without saying goodbye, but he did.

came up and left in a hurry.

Oh, I see.

241
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:02.846
And nothing happened between you two?

242
00:14:02.846 --> 00:14:06.981
Oh, of course not!
What could've happened between us?

243
00:14:06.981 --> 00:14:08.467
That's true.

244
00:14:08.467 --> 00:14:10.856
What are we going to do
about Hyun Soo, though?

245

No, Mother!

00:14:43.953 --> 00:14:45.789
To be frank, I should be thanking you.

256
00:14:45.789 --> 00:14:49.039
I'm sure you could have gotten a loan
from the best bank in the nation.

257
00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:51.295
And yet, you went out of your way

So I'd like to thank you again

No need to thank me.

260

You offered us the best deal, after all.

261
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.862
Oh, of course! You borrowed more than
10 billion won from us, after all.

262
00:14:59.862 --> 00:15:01.952
Is there anything else
I can assist you with?

263
00:15:02.794 --> 00:15:04.884
I wouldn't call it help, per se.

I just ask that you do
business ethically.

Um, I'm not quite sure
what you mean.

266
00:15:10.918 --> 00:15:12.592
I looked into it

267
00:15:12.592 --> 00:15:17.846
and most of the restaurants in that
neighborhood got loans from your bank.

00:15:24.304 --> 00:15:26.076
I think you owe me that.

Oh, I understand what you mean now.

273
00:15:29.068 --> 00:15:31.774

Yeah, the bank president that has a
strong hold on this neighborhood.

279
00:15:48.284 --> 00:15:51.396
Apparently, this man is
Ms. Soon Ae's ex-husband.

280
00:15:51.396 --> 00:15:52.486
Oh, really?

281
00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:55.586
Apparently, that woman Soon Ae's
father was a powerful guy

282
00:15:55.586 --> 00:15:58.967
but he sold off all his riches
when his only daughter got married

283
00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:01.182
and set up a nice little bank
for his daughter's husband.

284
00:16:01.182 --> 00:16:02.779
- Wow.
- But that guy

285
00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:05.793
framed his wife for adultery as soon
as his father-in-law died

286
00:16:05.793 --> 00:16:08.270
and kicked his wife out

Oh, so that's why Mr. Jang Dong Soo
was trying to beat that guy to a pulp

288
00:16:12.836 --> 00:16:13.971

That's right.

290
00:16:14.997 --> 00:16:17.338
He wanted to get a confession from him,
even if he had to beat it out of him.

291
00:16:17.338 --> 00:16:20.526
He beat him to a bloody pulp,
but didn't find out anything.

292
00:16:20.526 --> 00:16:22.553
Kim Jong Hyun is one
stubborn bastard, too.

293

Wait, then the person who planned
all this with Kim Jong Hyun

294
00:16:25.606 --> 00:16:28.256
and framed Ms. Soon Ae for
adultery was...

295
00:16:28.409 --> 00:16:32.279
Yeah, it's the guy who we promised
we'd hand over to Mr. Viper.

From now on, you two are eating

You're the CEO, right?
So all you need to do is say "okay!"

00:17:33.576 --> 00:17:36.373
The CEO can't just do anything
he pleases, though...

318
00:17:36.373 --> 00:17:37.651
Why are you getting involved?

319
00:17:37.651 --> 00:17:39.250
You're just an employee.

320
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.471
Come on, Soon Ae.

321
00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:41.894
Anyway, you're doing that from now on.

322
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:44.019
If you don't like it,
you can't have your office here!

323
00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:46.271
All right, I will discuss this
with my employees.

324
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.089
Really?

325
00:17:48.089 --> 00:17:49.375
Yes.

326
00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:52.878
Um... this isn't going to cause you
any trouble, is it?

327
00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:56.856
Yes. If we do that, I can take care
of some business at our office, too.

328
00:17:56.856 --> 00:17:58.596
Well, that's a relief, then.

329
00:17:58.596 --> 00:17:59.904
Anyway, do that.

330
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:02.632
I feel lonely without you guys around.

331
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:11.179
So I'd like it if Dan Ah and I only made
deliveries for Lively Handmade.

332
00:18:11.179 --> 00:18:12.327
What do you think?

333
00:18:12.327 --> 00:18:15.093
Well, I don't know. Let's hear out
everyone else's opinions first.

334
00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:16.192
That's the kind of company
we are, after all.

335
00:18:16.192 --> 00:18:19.112
All right.
All in favor, raise your hand.

336
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:21.395
One, two, three, four...

337
00:18:21.395 --> 00:18:22.979
I see, so it's unanimous.

338
00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:26.961
All right, be sure to stick
right next to each other.

339
00:18:26.961 --> 00:18:28.451
Why don't you guys just get married?

340
00:18:28.451 --> 00:18:30.250
- Hey!
- Whoa!

341
00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.400
Good idea!

342
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:37.106
- Get married! Get married!
- Get married! Get married!

343
00:18:39.606 --> 00:18:40.645
Shut up.

344
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.472
Um, yeah. Thanks for being
so understanding, everyone.

345
00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:47.094
Um, let's get to work.

346
00:18:47.094 --> 00:18:48.904
Let's head out
and get to work!

347
00:18:50.631 --> 00:18:51.681
Let's go!

348
00:18:54.857 --> 00:18:56.352
We got their permission.

349
00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:57.750
Let's stick right next to
each other now.

350
00:19:00.344 --> 00:19:04.695
Also, I'll send out Oh Jin Kyu's photo
in our group chat

351
00:19:04.695 --> 00:19:06.157
so our guys can look for him
while they make deliveries.

352
00:19:06.157 --> 00:19:07.256
Why, all of a sudden?

353
00:19:07.256 --> 00:19:10.819
Something just seems off.
I feel like something happened to him.

354
00:19:11.512 --> 00:19:15.048
Sure. To be honest,
I was a bit curious, too.

355
00:19:15.048 --> 00:19:16.489
So why didn't you say anything?

356
00:19:17.433 --> 00:19:21.529
Just in case.
I didn't want you to get upset.

357
00:19:22.347 --> 00:19:23.823
Ms. Lee Dan Ah.

358
00:19:23.823 --> 00:19:24.972
Yes, CEO Choi?

359
00:19:24.972 --> 00:19:26.289
Consider this a warning.

360
00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:28.346
I will be sure to heed it, sir.

361
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.105
<i>[Free meals at 10 o' clock]</i>

362
00:20:29.477 --> 00:20:31.199
Idiot.

363
00:20:44.665 --> 00:20:46.914
Here.
Drink this with your meal.

364
00:20:48.978 --> 00:20:51.423
I can't eat this. I feel like
the food is stuck in my throat.

365
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.875
Whoa! Hey, what are you
doing in there?

366
00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:14.933
Jeez!

367
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.481
Oh, damn it.

368
00:21:35.868 --> 00:21:38.681
Damn it, where did she go?

369
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:41.143
Oh man, this is bad.

370
00:21:41.143 --> 00:21:42.740
- Here I am.
- Whoa!

371
00:21:43.667 --> 00:21:44.856
My dad sent you,
didn't he?

372
00:21:44.856 --> 00:21:46.367
Um, no.
Not at all.

373
00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:48.929
I think you've misunderstood.

374
00:21:48.929 --> 00:21:52.652
I'm calling my dad. Want me to
tell him that I caught you?

375
00:21:52.652 --> 00:21:54.115
Oh, please, no!

376
00:21:54.115 --> 00:21:56.098
I'll be fired!

377
00:21:56.098 --> 00:21:59.013
I... actually have three kids.

378
00:21:59.013 --> 00:22:01.529
Answer my questions truthfully, then.

379
00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:03.727
There were originally three teams.

380
00:22:03.727 --> 00:22:07.279
I was assigned to you, and another
person was assigned to Choi Kang Soo.

381
00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:08.847
- Even Mister?
- Yes.

382
00:22:08.847 --> 00:22:11.866
All the men you meet with
are being watched, Ms. Ji Yoon.

383
00:22:11.866 --> 00:22:13.733
What is this?

384
00:22:13.733 --> 00:22:17.298
But Choi Kang Soo stopped being
monitored almost immediately.

385
00:22:17.298 --> 00:22:18.327
Why?

386
00:22:18.327 --> 00:22:21.948
Because it seems that he's dating
a woman named Lee Dan Ah.

387
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.317
Who's the last one, then?

388
00:22:25.317 --> 00:22:27.808
- Is it Mr. Jin Kyu?
- Yes, it's Oh Jin Kyu.

389
00:22:27.808 --> 00:22:29.048
Where is he now?

390
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.819
I don't think we can help
you out any longer.

391
00:22:31.819 --> 00:22:33.315
- What?
- Wait!

392
00:22:33.315 --> 00:22:36.837
What do you mean, we can't
push back our payment due date?

393
00:22:36.837 --> 00:22:38.683
That is what our office decided.

394
00:22:38.683 --> 00:22:41.807
I mean, but how could you do that
to us so suddenly?

395
00:22:41.807 --> 00:22:43.952
Business isn't even going
that well for us.

396
00:22:43.952 --> 00:22:45.625
At any rate, we cannot
grant you an extension.

397
00:22:45.625 --> 00:22:48.155
If any of you owe us any money,
please pay it back in full immediately.

398
00:22:48.155 --> 00:22:49.635
- Goodbye.
- Wait!

399
00:22:49.635 --> 00:22:50.722
Hey!

400
00:22:50.722 --> 00:22:54.573
- Oh my gosh, what do we do?
- What do we do?

401
00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:58.047
- How about we tell Kang Soo--
- He's not a bank!

402
00:22:59.048 --> 00:23:01.452
I mean, it's just because
I'm so frustrated!

403
00:23:02.356 --> 00:23:05.227
- We're all going to die!
- What do we do?

404
00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.721
Hello!

405
00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:08.739
Um, yeah.

406
00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:11.212
Is something the matter?

407
00:23:11.212 --> 00:23:12.739
No, it's nothing.

408
00:23:12.739 --> 00:23:14.112
What is it?

409
00:23:14.112 --> 00:23:15.587
Don't worry, it's our business.

410
00:23:15.587 --> 00:23:18.962
You focus on delivering, CEO Choi.

411
00:23:18.962 --> 00:23:22.366
That's the only way out for us now.

412
00:23:24.142 --> 00:23:26.411
All right, I'll work hard.

413
00:23:26.996 --> 00:23:32.359
But you have to tell me
if something happens, all right?

414
00:23:32.359 --> 00:23:35.068
Sure. Go on, now.

415
00:23:35.068 --> 00:23:37.135
All right.
Goodbye!

416
00:24:00.306 --> 00:24:02.069
A location tracker?

417
00:24:02.069 --> 00:24:04.214
Yeah, I put it in his shoe.

418
00:24:04.214 --> 00:24:07.443
I think he took the bait that
Viper tossed at him.

419
00:24:07.443 --> 00:24:08.642
Really?

420
00:24:08.642 --> 00:24:10.048
He'll definitely be
making moves again soon.

421
00:24:10.048 --> 00:24:13.124
And when he does, I'll find out
where he is, and teach him a lesson.

422
00:24:14.378 --> 00:24:16.628
But... I'm a bit scared.

423
00:24:17.068 --> 00:24:18.347
Can you come with me?

424
00:24:21.138 --> 00:24:24.779
But... wouldn't it be better to
report this to the cops?

425
00:24:24.779 --> 00:24:26.792
If I do that, they'll lock up
Dong Soo first!

426
00:24:26.792 --> 00:24:29.106
I'm sure he already did
something with Viper!

427
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:34.086
Oh, what are you doing here?

428
00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:36.895
Oh, um, nothing.
Let's go downstairs.

429
00:24:36.895 --> 00:24:37.895
All right.

430
00:24:50.325 --> 00:24:52.183
- Have a safe trip home!
- Have a safe trip home!

431
00:24:52.183 --> 00:24:54.084
- All right, good work.
- See you tomorrow.

432
00:25:02.285 --> 00:25:04.844
I guess the boss gave up on
following Ms. Soon Ae home now.

433
00:25:04.844 --> 00:25:06.277
Yeah, I guess so.

434
00:25:06.277 --> 00:25:08.205
Did something happen between them?

435
00:25:08.205 --> 00:25:10.152
No, not at all!

436
00:25:10.152 --> 00:25:13.156
Let's hurry and go inside!
We need to have our meeting.

437
00:25:26.116 --> 00:25:28.583
I really hate my photo.

438
00:25:28.583 --> 00:25:31.038
I need to take it again.
Jeez.

439
00:25:31.038 --> 00:25:32.567
<i>Yo, who's the hot chick
on your company website?</i>

440
00:25:32.567 --> 00:25:33.683
<i>Kang Soo's girlfriend.</i>

441
00:25:33.683 --> 00:25:34.917
<i>- Wow.
- Kang Soo dates?</i>

442
00:25:34.917 --> 00:25:36.396
<i>- She's so pretty!
- Did Kang Soo...</i>

443
00:25:36.396 --> 00:25:37.825
Does it look good?

444
00:25:37.825 --> 00:25:38.960
Yes.

445
00:25:41.252 --> 00:25:43.266
Good work, everyone!

446
00:25:45.834 --> 00:25:48.596
Let's keep this short,
and go get some rest.

447
00:25:48.596 --> 00:25:50.452
- Let's talk about our sales first.
- Sure.

448
00:25:50.452 --> 00:25:51.452
Here.

449
00:26:16.808 --> 00:26:18.397
Don't eat that!

450
00:26:20.199 --> 00:26:21.768
Oh.

451
00:26:21.768 --> 00:26:22.792
Hey, Ji Yoon.

452
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:27.257
- Let go of this!
- It's not like that!

453
00:26:27.257 --> 00:26:28.944
- Hurry up!
- No, it's not like that!

454
00:26:28.944 --> 00:26:30.318
Wait!

455
00:26:34.166 --> 00:26:36.328
- Just leave!
- Mr. Jin Kyu!

456
00:26:37.248 --> 00:26:40.295
Just leave me alone!
Let me be!

457
00:26:40.295 --> 00:26:43.021
Just let me live like this until I die!

458
00:26:43.021 --> 00:26:44.871
- Ugh!
- Ow!

459
00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:52.866
Why are you crying?

460
00:26:52.866 --> 00:26:54.242
I don't know!

461
00:27:08.525 --> 00:27:11.000
What's most important now
is advertising the app.

462
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.316
We have to make people think of
"Strongest Deliveryman"

463
00:27:12.316 --> 00:27:13.316
when they think of takeout.

464
00:27:13.394 --> 00:27:16.936
If the app spreads enough,
we can add group discounts.

465
00:27:16.936 --> 00:27:18.327
We could increase banquet guests.

466
00:27:18.327 --> 00:27:21.808
Is there something bigger we could
do besides fliers?

467
00:27:24.423 --> 00:27:27.058
Take off your shirts and run around
with fliers on your stomachs.

468
00:27:27.058 --> 00:27:28.298
People will start talking soon.

469
00:27:28.298 --> 00:27:31.200
Come on, Sung Jae.
We have our face to think of.

470
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.638
Yes and honestly my body will have
a negative effect.

471
00:27:36.646 --> 00:27:37.729
<i>[Soon Ae]</i>

472
00:27:37.729 --> 00:27:38.875
Lose some weight.

473
00:27:39.596 --> 00:27:40.798
One minute.

474
00:27:46.395 --> 00:27:47.756
Yes. It's Dan Ah.

475
00:27:47.756 --> 00:27:49.156
<i>He's making his move.</i>

476
00:27:50.519 --> 00:27:51.673
I was in bed to sleep.

477
00:27:51.673 --> 00:27:53.962
Just in case, I decided to check
and the mark moved

478
00:27:53.962 --> 00:27:55.923
He just crossed Cheonho Bridge.

479
00:27:55.923 --> 00:27:58.221
I'll take a taxi.
You ride your motorcycle.

480
00:27:58.474 --> 00:27:59.516
Okay, bye.

481
00:28:02.395 --> 00:28:03.992
He's dead.

482
00:28:10.425 --> 00:28:12.676
Sorry, but I have to head home.

483
00:28:12.676 --> 00:28:14.116
Why? Is something wrong?

484
00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:16.298
No, Yeon Ji wants me to come.

485
00:28:16.298 --> 00:28:18.359
Yeon Ji? She's already home from work?

486
00:28:18.359 --> 00:28:19.430
Mind your own business.

487
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.459
Bye.

488
00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.190
Let's continue.

489
00:28:35.721 --> 00:28:37.030
Did you starve too?

490
00:28:37.631 --> 00:28:39.099
- Yes.
- Why?

491
00:28:39.102 --> 00:28:40.251
I had no appetite.

492
00:28:40.251 --> 00:28:44.290
There was no one to annoy me while
I ate so I had no appetite.

493
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.202
This is why habits can be scary.

494
00:28:48.344 --> 00:28:50.560
Tell me if there's anything more
you want to eat.

495
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.182
I'm going to pay with the card
you gave me anyway.

496
00:28:55.128 --> 00:28:57.107
- Look at you laughing.
- Why?

497
00:28:57.378 --> 00:28:59.931
Do I seem like a moron laughing
in this situation?

498
00:28:59.931 --> 00:29:02.090
No, it's cute.

499
00:29:04.808 --> 00:29:05.837
What?

500
00:29:06.462 --> 00:29:08.036
Did something happen to you?

501
00:29:08.036 --> 00:29:09.750
- Yes.
- What?

502
00:29:10.491 --> 00:29:14.241
To keep it simple,
my first love was a failure.

503
00:29:14.241 --> 00:29:15.712
Ah, that.

504
00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:17.770
You seem pretty happy, considering.

505
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:21.480
I've always been quick to
pick up on the situation.

506
00:29:21.481 --> 00:29:23.279
So, I thought about it.

507
00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:26.461
Time is very precious.
I should move onto my second love.

508
00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:27.616
With who?

509
00:29:27.616 --> 00:29:28.770
You.

510
00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:35.326
Let's be together today.

511
00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:41.645
Are you... are you crazy?

512
00:29:41.645 --> 00:29:44.738
Yes, I'm crazy... for you.

513
00:29:46.587 --> 00:29:47.843
Don't do that.

514
00:29:48.757 --> 00:29:50.473
It's scary.

515
00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.260
Do you know what's really scary?

516
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:56.386
What could it be?

517
00:29:56.386 --> 00:29:59.191
You will be monitored by me
24 hours a day, Jin Kyu.

518
00:29:59.191 --> 00:30:01.249
You can never run away.

519
00:30:16.752 --> 00:30:17.805
Oh dear.

520
00:30:23.301 --> 00:30:25.954
So, we just need to monitor
Oh Jin Kyu now?

521
00:30:25.954 --> 00:30:27.042
Yes.

522
00:30:27.595 --> 00:30:31.477
Yes, we just need to do what
Ms. Ji Yoon says.

523
00:30:31.989 --> 00:30:33.079
All right.

524
00:30:41.733 --> 00:30:42.763
Yes.

525
00:30:43.443 --> 00:30:45.612
Yes, I crossed the bridge.

526
00:30:46.432 --> 00:30:48.164
Okay, I'll head over there.

527
00:30:52.234 --> 00:30:56.587
Oh! She looks a lot like
Kang Soo's girlfriend.

528
00:30:57.628 --> 00:30:58.912
Is that his girlfriend?

529
00:30:58.912 --> 00:31:00.770
Hold on. She's right here.

530
00:31:03.798 --> 00:31:06.180
I think it is his girlfriend.

531
00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.240
You're right.

532
00:31:09.346 --> 00:31:10.779
We'll finish here.

533
00:31:12.513 --> 00:31:14.529
- Good job, everyone.
- You too.

534
00:31:14.529 --> 00:31:15.922
- Go to sleep.
- Okay.

535
00:31:15.922 --> 00:31:17.443
- Bye.
- Bye, CEO Choi.

536
00:31:17.443 --> 00:31:18.748
Good night. Get home safely.

537
00:31:18.748 --> 00:31:20.137
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

538
00:31:20.978 --> 00:31:22.176
What are you doing, Gong Gi?

539
00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:24.426
I really don't like my picture on
the homepage.

540
00:31:28.404 --> 00:31:30.098
Hey. It's been a long time.

541
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.896
- What?
- <i>I just saw your girlfriend nearby.</i>

542
00:31:34.896 --> 00:31:36.750
<i>She's even prettier in real life.</i>

543
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.769
<i>Wow, I envy you.</i>

544
00:31:38.769 --> 00:31:40.433
Which way did she go?

545
00:31:40.434 --> 00:31:41.868
<i>She was headed towards Junggok-dong.</i>

546
00:31:41.868 --> 00:31:43.473
Okay. Thanks.

547
00:31:44.054 --> 00:31:45.064
Bye.

548
00:31:46.598 --> 00:31:48.306
What? Is something wrong?

549
00:31:48.974 --> 00:31:50.998
I think something's happened
to Dan Ah.

550
00:31:51.366 --> 00:31:53.720
- What?
- I have to go somewhere.

551
00:32:24.028 --> 00:32:25.097
Where is he?

552
00:32:25.097 --> 00:32:26.760
He's tied up inside.

553
00:32:28.174 --> 00:32:29.221
Go on in.

554
00:32:37.347 --> 00:32:38.767
What is it?

555
00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:41.166
Why would you place him
with his back to me?

556
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.537
What?

557
00:32:44.806 --> 00:32:46.116
You punk!

558
00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.483
Why you little...

559
00:33:06.385 --> 00:33:08.215
I'm sorry, Boss.

560
00:33:08.215 --> 00:33:10.113
I need to live too.

561
00:33:10.113 --> 00:33:12.150
I lied to you, Boss.

562
00:33:13.939 --> 00:33:16.087
How can I stay alive?

563
00:33:16.087 --> 00:33:17.556
Viper, you punk!

564
00:33:17.556 --> 00:33:20.579
Relax and go on before me.

565
00:33:24.064 --> 00:33:26.231
End it for him quickly.

566
00:33:26.231 --> 00:33:27.352
Yes, Boss.

567
00:33:30.914 --> 00:33:33.913
Hey, Jang Dong Soo! Where are you?

568
00:33:36.603 --> 00:33:38.410
You dumb idiot!

569
00:33:40.498 --> 00:33:42.656
Run!

570
00:33:44.445 --> 00:33:45.741
Catch them!

571
00:33:50.846 --> 00:33:52.327
Stop!

572
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.270
Untie me now if you want to live.

573
00:34:57.362 --> 00:34:58.454
Now.

574
00:34:59.085 --> 00:35:00.215
Yes, Boss.

575
00:35:10.826 --> 00:35:12.954
Why these little punks...

576
00:35:22.449 --> 00:35:23.518
That's enough!

577
00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:44.235
Please spare us, Boss.
Let me live, just this once.

578
00:35:44.235 --> 00:35:46.454
I've served you since I was 17.

579
00:35:46.454 --> 00:35:48.226
Think of the past and let me live.

580
00:35:48.614 --> 00:35:50.052
Let me live, Boss.

581
00:35:51.025 --> 00:35:53.184
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

582
00:35:54.454 --> 00:35:56.023
You're really dead if you do.

583
00:35:56.023 --> 00:35:57.264
Thank you!

584
00:36:00.126 --> 00:36:01.442
Thank you, Boss!

585
00:36:12.626 --> 00:36:14.840
Soon Ae, I'm sorry. I was truly wrong.

586
00:36:15.168 --> 00:36:16.496
Then just die.

587
00:36:19.891 --> 00:36:21.860
Kang Soo, take me home.

588
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.601
Yes.

589
00:36:32.277 --> 00:36:33.536
Get on. I'll drive you home.

590
00:36:33.536 --> 00:36:34.746
Are you crazy?

591
00:36:35.587 --> 00:36:36.605
Kang Soo.

592
00:36:36.605 --> 00:36:41.295
Sorry, I'm hurt, so I don't think
I can drive you.

593
00:36:41.295 --> 00:36:43.074
- Hey!
- Hurry up and get on.

594
00:36:43.074 --> 00:36:44.945
What's with you?
It's not the time for that.

595
00:36:44.945 --> 00:36:47.393
Please get on.
It is the time for that now.

596
00:36:48.389 --> 00:36:49.744
You stay out of it.

597
00:36:51.295 --> 00:36:52.367
Get on.

598
00:36:53.951 --> 00:36:55.925
Gosh, so annoying.

599
00:37:12.449 --> 00:37:13.581
I'll get going too.

600
00:37:13.581 --> 00:37:15.251
Thank you, Gong Gi.

601
00:37:23.201 --> 00:37:24.860
What were you doing?

602
00:37:29.181 --> 00:37:30.501
Why did you come alone?

603
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:34.041
Are you a police detective?

604
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.960
What would you have done if
you got hurt?

605
00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:43.561
What if you had died?

606
00:37:51.422 --> 00:37:52.565
You're fired.

607
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.362
I'm sorry.

608
00:38:23.835 --> 00:38:26.264
I thought you'd follow me if you knew.

609
00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:29.833
I didn't want to put you in danger.

610
00:38:34.054 --> 00:38:35.931
Stop being angry, okay?

611
00:38:37.105 --> 00:38:38.833
I'm really sorry.

612
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.842
Kang Soo.

613
00:38:46.621 --> 00:38:48.072
Please forgive me.

614
00:38:48.853 --> 00:38:50.206
I'm asking you.

615
00:38:51.594 --> 00:38:52.905
Just this once.

616
00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:58.016
Just this one time.
I won't do it again.

617
00:39:14.855 --> 00:39:16.279
Are you hurt at all?

618
00:39:18.224 --> 00:39:19.349
No.

619
00:39:21.371 --> 00:39:22.641
That's a relief.

620
00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.550
Kang Soo...

621
00:39:54.623 --> 00:39:55.719
Are you cold?

622
00:39:56.195 --> 00:39:57.297
What!

623
00:39:59.056 --> 00:40:00.326
Are you cold!

624
00:40:01.646 --> 00:40:03.016
Do I like it?

625
00:40:03.866 --> 00:40:05.206
You're crazy.

626
00:40:10.889 --> 00:40:13.842
Hey, shouldn't you be giving me
a ride?

627
00:40:14.362 --> 00:40:16.532
What? I can't hear you!

628
00:40:16.532 --> 00:40:17.985
Oh, seriously!

629
00:40:33.407 --> 00:40:36.001
Gosh, my hair looks like a
crazy girl's hair.

630
00:40:36.639 --> 00:40:37.811
Get lost now.

631
00:40:38.288 --> 00:40:39.431
I'm really sorry.

632
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.230
- To tell you the truth, Viper said...
- Shut up.

633
00:40:43.561 --> 00:40:47.079
Whatever that guy said,
it's all in the past.

634
00:40:48.139 --> 00:40:50.630
I've forgotten everything.
You should forget too.

635
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:54.259
You forget everything else,
so why do you remember the bad things?

636
00:40:54.259 --> 00:40:55.380
Yes, I'm sorry.

637
00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.851
I'm so sick of hearing those words.

638
00:40:59.686 --> 00:41:01.820
- Be careful getting home.
- You be careful!

639
00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:13.730
After we beat down the last guy,
it was daybreak.

640
00:41:14.259 --> 00:41:16.840
Wow, really?

641
00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:19.512
Then how many guys did you beat down?

642
00:41:20.337 --> 00:41:22.146
I see you didn't die.

643
00:41:22.757 --> 00:41:25.699
Yes, I was honestly surprised
at myself.

644
00:41:25.699 --> 00:41:27.177
I was very surprised.

645
00:41:27.177 --> 00:41:28.683
Then can we sleep now?

646
00:41:28.683 --> 00:41:29.815
Good night.

647
00:41:29.815 --> 00:41:31.329
Sweet dreams.

648
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.369
You rascals are annoying.

649
00:41:35.632 --> 00:41:39.862
How come this company hires new recruits
and doesn't have a welcome party?

650
00:41:40.333 --> 00:41:45.134
Now that you mention it,
should we go on a company retreat?

651
00:41:45.134 --> 00:41:46.224
It's a holiday this week.

652
00:41:46.224 --> 00:41:47.264
A company retreat?

653
00:41:47.264 --> 00:41:48.773
Yes, we should go.

654
00:41:48.773 --> 00:41:50.612
- Where should we go?
- Your hometown.

655
00:41:50.612 --> 00:41:52.293
You said the scenery is good there.

656
00:41:52.293 --> 00:41:53.407
Where is it?

657
00:41:53.407 --> 00:41:55.722
Hwaseong, Maehyangri.

658
00:42:03.257 --> 00:42:05.563
Wow, the scenery is great.

659
00:42:05.563 --> 00:42:07.733
It's beautiful here.

660
00:42:07.733 --> 00:42:08.887
Let's go.

661
00:42:10.748 --> 00:42:12.172
- Min Chan.
- Yes?

662
00:42:12.172 --> 00:42:13.797
Buy some land here once you earn money.

663
00:42:13.797 --> 00:42:15.741
You'll earn a lot of money once it's
developed.

664
00:42:16.159 --> 00:42:20.038
I do want to buy all the land here
if I ever have money.

665
00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:22.960
Then I won't let anyone build anything.

666
00:42:23.619 --> 00:42:24.750
Why?

667
00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:27.541
It's the most beautiful as it is now.

668
00:42:29.101 --> 00:42:31.190
I want to preserve it.

669
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.661
That would be hard to do in our
country though.

670
00:42:33.661 --> 00:42:34.791
Why is that hard?

671
00:42:35.132 --> 00:42:37.780
I'm going to help Min Chan buy all
the land here.

672
00:42:39.922 --> 00:42:41.420
That's our CEO.

673
00:42:45.538 --> 00:42:46.692
Wow.

674
00:42:46.717 --> 00:42:49.134
This was a firing range for
combat fighter jets.

675
00:42:49.134 --> 00:42:50.405
All of these fell down.

676
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.587
- Wow.
- Wow.

677
00:42:54.409 --> 00:42:56.012
Look at this.

678
00:42:56.012 --> 00:42:58.561
- Look at this.
- So heavy.

679
00:43:01.576 --> 00:43:03.746
Wow, so heavy!

680
00:43:09.416 --> 00:43:13.762
Ah, so this neighborhood was a
firing range for fighter jets.

681
00:43:13.762 --> 00:43:18.235
Yes, it was really like living in
a war zone back then.

682
00:43:18.824 --> 00:43:22.103
My ears were numb from the sounds
of bombs going off all day.

683
00:43:22.103 --> 00:43:25.994
Min Chan, how did you live in a
place like this?

684
00:43:27.425 --> 00:43:28.565
I don't know.

685
00:43:30.255 --> 00:43:31.835
I just lived.

686
00:43:32.617 --> 00:43:36.096
Everyone here... lived that way.

687
00:43:46.476 --> 00:43:48.123
Wow!

688
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:51.083
Look at that.

689
00:43:54.382 --> 00:43:55.869
Welcome.

690
00:43:56.639 --> 00:43:58.851
- Can we taste it?
- Yes.

691
00:43:59.215 --> 00:44:00.373
Here.

692
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.387
Here you go.

693
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:07.233
Here.

694
00:44:07.233 --> 00:44:08.491
Stop eating it.

695
00:44:08.491 --> 00:44:09.751
Me, me.

696
00:44:19.063 --> 00:44:21.009
This place reminds me of our hometown.

697
00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:23.201
Yeah, you're right.

698
00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:28.558
You must be thinking about your dad.

699
00:44:33.668 --> 00:44:35.779
Aren't you thinking about anyone?

700
00:44:36.116 --> 00:44:37.867
I'm just an orphan.
Who would I think about?

701
00:44:38.878 --> 00:44:40.628
I remember playing with you.

702
00:44:42.938 --> 00:44:45.891
How did you two become friends anyway?

703
00:44:45.891 --> 00:44:47.148
We just did.

704
00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.831
I was the one who beat up everyone.

705
00:44:50.449 --> 00:44:52.699
He did whatever he wanted
no matter how much you beat him up.

706
00:44:52.699 --> 00:44:54.699
Two idiots met each other.

707
00:45:02.201 --> 00:45:03.701
Tell me the truth.

708
00:45:03.726 --> 00:45:05.449
You're alone with Train Guy,
aren't you?

709
00:45:05.449 --> 00:45:08.382
I told you I'm not.
All the company people are here.

710
00:45:08.382 --> 00:45:09.661
Then put anyone on the phone.

711
00:45:09.951 --> 00:45:13.230
Put that Gong Gi rice guy on or
the guys that come to my class.

712
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.282
Forget it. Why should I?

713
00:45:15.282 --> 00:45:16.612
- Bye.
- Hey!

714
00:45:18.463 --> 00:45:21.440
Wow, Lee Dan Ah.
You're being reckless now.

715
00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.851
Hello!

716
00:45:23.722 --> 00:45:25.152
Who are you?

717
00:45:25.152 --> 00:45:27.201
I'm moving into the third floor.

718
00:45:27.201 --> 00:45:29.382
Ah, I see. Hello.

719
00:45:29.382 --> 00:45:30.550
Which floor are you?

720
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:32.268
I'm on the rooftop.

721
00:45:32.268 --> 00:45:34.617
Oh my! You live with Dan Ah.

722
00:45:34.617 --> 00:45:37.597
Do you know Dan Ah?
How do you know her?

723
00:45:37.597 --> 00:45:38.978
It's a long story.

724
00:45:38.978 --> 00:45:41.588
Please tell Dan Ah that Ji Yoon
is moving in.

725
00:45:41.933 --> 00:45:44.128
Okay. I'll do that.

726
00:45:45.059 --> 00:45:47.329
Then see you next time.

727
00:46:03.168 --> 00:46:04.929
Finished moving in.

728
00:46:06.297 --> 00:46:07.945
Wow, it's so big.

729
00:46:10.867 --> 00:46:13.518
It's more than enough space for two.

730
00:46:30.032 --> 00:46:33.492
Ah, I've totally been kidnapped.

731
00:46:34.637 --> 00:46:36.103
- Zero.
- Zero.

732
00:46:36.103 --> 00:46:37.605
- Seven.
- Bang!

733
00:46:46.797 --> 00:46:48.538
Indian rice!

734
00:46:56.498 --> 00:46:58.148
Zero, zero, seven, bang!

735
00:47:00.701 --> 00:47:02.824
Indian rice!

736
00:47:03.608 --> 00:47:04.940
Start!

737
00:47:13.773 --> 00:47:14.826
Stop.

738
00:47:14.826 --> 00:47:15.978
Start.

739
00:47:23.087 --> 00:47:25.288
Rock, paper, scissors.

740
00:47:51.601 --> 00:47:53.808
If we're done with the childish games,
let's drink now.

741
00:47:53.808 --> 00:47:56.030
Yes, we should have a drink.

742
00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.360
Did we buy alcohol though?

743
00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.659
Oh no. We didn't.

744
00:48:02.509 --> 00:48:05.322
Oh, you guys. How could you?

745
00:48:05.322 --> 00:48:08.257
Hey, Supervisor Song Min Chan.
Buy the alcohol.

746
00:48:08.257 --> 00:48:09.659
- Manager Kim.
- Deputy Chief Kim.

747
00:48:09.659 --> 00:48:10.913
- Section Chief Jung.
- Manager Han.

748
00:48:10.913 --> 00:48:12.282
Miss Lee... Lee.

749
00:48:16.472 --> 00:48:18.487
Fine, I'll buy it.

750
00:48:23.849 --> 00:48:26.393
I'll go with her.

751
00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.101
Just go for a walk.

752
00:48:29.101 --> 00:48:30.764
- Huh?
- We have drinks.

753
00:48:30.764 --> 00:48:32.393
We prepared this for you.

754
00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:36.579
Thank you.

755
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.436
You were the first to hit me!

756
00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:46.501
Senior! Can't we buy some beer too?

757
00:48:46.501 --> 00:48:49.114
You came to an MT and
you want to drink beer?

758
00:48:49.114 --> 00:48:51.204
- Are you crazy?
- You have to mix drinks.

759
00:48:51.204 --> 00:48:54.157
- Forget it.
- Senior, please buy us beer.

760
00:48:54.672 --> 00:48:56.536
- Beer!
- I don't have money.

761
00:48:56.536 --> 00:48:57.536
Hurry up.

762
00:48:58.027 --> 00:48:59.076
Dan Ah.

763
00:49:03.554 --> 00:49:05.570
- They have alcohol.
- What?

764
00:49:05.958 --> 00:49:07.380
Should we go for a walk?

765
00:49:11.378 --> 00:49:12.550
This place...

766
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:17.724
I noticed a lot of college students here.

767
00:49:18.362 --> 00:49:20.126
Yeah, I noticed that too.

768
00:49:22.306 --> 00:49:24.326
Didn't you ever want to go to college?

769
00:49:25.514 --> 00:49:27.094
What's the point of going?

770
00:49:27.326 --> 00:49:29.532
Even if you graduate,
there's no solution.

771
00:49:30.875 --> 00:49:34.996
Whether you graduate from college or not,
there's no hope in this place.

772
00:49:37.645 --> 00:49:39.532
Even a guy like me is the CEO of
a company.

773
00:49:41.208 --> 00:49:42.947
Isn't that doing pretty okay?

774
00:49:44.958 --> 00:49:46.177
What is it?

775
00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:48.677
Isn't that pretty hopeful?

776
00:49:48.677 --> 00:49:50.829
I'm happy you're the CEO of your
own company too.

777
00:49:52.416 --> 00:49:55.003
I'm sincerely cheering for you to
succeed and do well.

778
00:49:55.003 --> 00:49:56.067
But?

779
00:49:56.603 --> 00:49:58.184
Honestly, I'm nervous.

780
00:49:58.184 --> 00:50:03.344
I feel like a nice guy like you won't be
left alone to succeed.

781
00:50:03.344 --> 00:50:04.730
In this Hell Joseon...

782
00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:06.905
So, in the end...

783
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:10.925
you're going to leave.

784
00:50:16.755 --> 00:50:21.009
Wherever you are,
I want you to be happy.

785
00:50:22.835 --> 00:50:24.710
I felt that way the first time I saw you.

786
00:50:25.139 --> 00:50:27.409
- The first time?
- Yes.

787
00:50:29.128 --> 00:50:31.663
The moment I heard you had been
delivering for five years...

788
00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:39.454
Just one time, I saw a girl who did
deliveries like you.

789
00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:44.733
She came to the Chinese restaurant
I worked at and said she could do it.

790
00:50:45.884 --> 00:50:47.442
She really wanted the job.

791
00:50:47.855 --> 00:50:48.916
Then what?

792
00:50:48.916 --> 00:50:50.603
She quit in three days.

793
00:50:53.025 --> 00:50:55.418
Every time she went out with the
steel delivery case...

794
00:50:56.532 --> 00:50:59.465
people would stare at her as if
she was some side show.

795
00:50:59.465 --> 00:51:02.844
People would whisper and comment
whenever she walked by.

796
00:51:02.844 --> 00:51:04.804
Every time she received change...

797
00:51:05.675 --> 00:51:07.962
people would try to grab her hand.

798
00:51:11.179 --> 00:51:13.367
So, she came in crying everyday.

799
00:51:15.552 --> 00:51:17.340
Then she quit after three days.

800
00:51:20.766 --> 00:51:23.574
Once I heard you lasted five years...

801
00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:28.364
I felt pain without realizing it.

802
00:51:29.855 --> 00:51:33.315
I move from neighborhood to neighborhood
without much thought.

803
00:51:34.145 --> 00:51:36.134
For you to move to a new neighborhood...

804
00:51:38.597 --> 00:51:43.614
you must have to go through that
hardship all over again.

805
00:51:44.514 --> 00:51:48.300
That must be so hard and sad.

806
00:51:53.612 --> 00:51:55.132
I felt like I might know.

807
00:51:56.581 --> 00:51:58.181
So, my heart ached.

808
00:52:04.956 --> 00:52:06.038
Dan Ah.

809
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.059
Can't I make you happy?

810
00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:23.458
Can you not leave?

811
00:52:25.788 --> 00:52:27.893
If a person like me can succeed...

812
00:52:29.137 --> 00:52:30.876
you don't have to leave.

813
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.588
You could be happy here too.

814
00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:42.418
I don't know.

815
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:45.860
I just don't know.

816
00:52:57.277 --> 00:52:58.657
Don't go.

817
00:53:03.862 --> 00:53:05.179
Stay here.

818
00:53:06.471 --> 00:53:07.742
I'll try.

819
00:53:14.063 --> 00:53:15.891
I'll try to make you happy.

820
00:54:03.087 --> 00:54:13.087
