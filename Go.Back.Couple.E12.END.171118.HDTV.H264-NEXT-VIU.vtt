3
00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:09.909
Hello?

4
00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.179
Where are you?

5
00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.409
What?

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.079
I'm crying.

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.649
Should I cry by myself again?

8
00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:24.689
Don't cry.

9
00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.259
I'll be there.

10
00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.529
I'll be there. Stay right there.

11
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.730
- He's running out. - No.

12
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.730
Wait.

13
00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:06.870
Jun Su! Jun Su!

14
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.029
Ma Jin Joo!

15
00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.210
Oh, no...

16
00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:53.650
Ban Do. No...

17
00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.590
Stay with me, Ban Do.

18
00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.919
Honey!

19
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.129
No. No...

20
00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:09.729
No.

21
00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.469
No. Get up.

22
00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.069
Get up.

23
00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.569
No, no...

24
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.939
No, no...

25
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.140
Get up.

26
00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:29.620
Honey!

27
00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.719
Honey.

28
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.219
Get up.

29
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.920
Get up!

30
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.520
Ban Do.

31
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.849
(Operating room)

32
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.499
Ban Do.

33
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.710
Ban Do.

34
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.310
No...

35
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.110
No...

36
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.449
What are you doing?

37
00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.560
It's alive again.

38
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.560
It is, but...

39
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.129
did I water it too much?

40
00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.800
It's not looking well.

41
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.199
You have to water it consistently.

42
00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.729
It can't take it, if you water it too much at once.

43
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.469
Come out, honey.

44
00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.300
You said your hands and feet hurt. I'll massage them for you.

45
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.670
- Let me finish cleaning first. - Okay.

46
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.710
Please call his family. He needs surgery now.

47
00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:09.650
I'm his family.

48
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.479
I'll sign the form. Please operate on him now.

49
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.819
A friend can't sign this form.

50
00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.550
We need to know his blood type and his medications.

51
00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:16.819
I know them.

52
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.660
His blood type is A.

53
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.060
He has asthma.

54
00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:22.030
He's allergic to peaches.

55
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.360
I'm really his family.

56
00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:26.470
Please hurry.

57
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.129
What if something happens to him?

58
00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:29.569
Ban Do!

59
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.100
Where is he?

60
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.839
- Where is Ban Do? - Goodness.

61
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:33.970
Is he here?

62
00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:38.139
Mother.

63
00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:50.959
Hey.

64
00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:53.259
You didn't shave yourself clean again.

65
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.999
Goodness, you and your impatience.

66
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.069
You can't visit Choi Ban Do.

67
00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:03.639
Well...

68
00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.199
The operation went well, and he's recovering.

69
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.639
Why can't I see him?

70
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.170
You're right,

71
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.209
but only family members can see him.

72
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.509
What?

73
00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:15.350
Can I see him today?

74
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.519
No, not yet.

75
00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:18.949
Is he really okay?

76
00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:20.389
He's recovering.

77
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.550
You keep saying that.

78
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.660
No visitors allowed means he's not well.

79
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.189
Well...

80
00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:40.139
Mother.

81
00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:46.379
Ban Do's girlfriend?

82
00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:47.910
Pardon?

83
00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:50.579
Yes.

84
00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:53.949
I'm Ma Jin Joo.

85
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.050
You have a pretty name.

86
00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.519
I was so out of it that day, I couldn't talk to you.

87
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.660
You like Ban Do a lot, don't you?

88
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:06.670
I was shocked because you cried more than I did.

89
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.240
Ban Do woke up,

90
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.600
and he's okay now.

91
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.339
The hospital won't allow visitors.

92
00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:16.980
Don't worry, and go home.

93
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.439
I'll call you when you can visit him.

94
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.780
Take care.

95
00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:23.780
Mother.

96
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.620
Is he really okay?

97
00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:34.360
I believe Ban Do's surgery went well,

98
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.930
and he's recovering fast thanks to your prayers.

99
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.829
Don't worry.

100
00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.810
Yes. Okay, Mother.

101
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.209
Okay.

102
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.839
Bye.

103
00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:54.949
What did she say?

104
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.449
She says we don't have to come too early for the New Year.

105
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.449
Because your father will nag at us...

106
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.160
to have a baby.

107
00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:05.120
Gosh, Dad.

108
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.430
Don't mind him.

109
00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.759
I don't.

110
00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:13.470
I love it when...

111
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.800
your mother calls me "our Jin Joo".

112
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.399
Our Jin Joo?

113
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.910
She doesn't call me "my daughter-in-law".

114
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.439
She calls me our Jin Joo.

115
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.410
I think she's doing that so I wouldn't feel left out.

116
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.280
Anyway, I like that.

117
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.629
Please...

118
00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:47.030
don't worry.

119
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.939
Thank you.

120
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.730
She went home.

121
00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:24.240
She comes because she's worried about you.

122
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.110
Why won't you see her?

123
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.339
You even risked your life to save her.

124
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.609
Anyway, she's so nice and pretty.

125
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:42.089
She is.

126
00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:48.930
- Mom. - Yes?

127
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.729
Remember this even if you don't remember.

128
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.770
She was really good to you.

129
00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.640
You keep talking nonsense.

130
00:09:00.609 --> 00:09:01.640
Goodness.

131
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.510
Get some more rest.

132
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.459
Ban Do.

133
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.890
Jin Joo.

134
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.160
Did you see Ban Do?

135
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.959
No, because he isn't allowed to see visitors.

136
00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:27.130
What?

137
00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:28.900
What do you mean?

138
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.500
I'm here because Ban Do told me to come.

139
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.609
Let's get a divorce.

140
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.650
We're too unhappy together.

141
00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:45.150
I am unimaginably unhappy.

142
00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:48.420
I like being in your arms the most.

143
00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:57.329
Hey, you're here.

144
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.729
Ban Do.

145
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.349
Why?

146
00:10:18.349 --> 00:10:19.479
Why did you do that?

147
00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:22.689
I thought...

148
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.260
you were going to die.

149
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.489
My world became blank,

150
00:10:28.689 --> 00:10:30.130
and I couldn't breathe.

151
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.329
In that short moment,

152
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.930
I was so scared...

153
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.439
and afraid.

154
00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:40.969
Every cell in my body was frozen.

155
00:10:42.439 --> 00:10:43.540
Like when my mom died.

156
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.949
I couldn't do anything...

157
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.050
because I wasn't your family.

158
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.050
They said I wasn't family.

159
00:10:56.219 --> 00:10:58.160
I couldn't give consent to your surgery.

160
00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:03.300
My husband of 18 years was dying.

161
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.400
It was just for a surgery.

162
00:11:14.369 --> 00:11:15.540
Why did you?

163
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.339
Why did you avoid me?

164
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:23.819
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:26.589
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:28.719 --> 00:11:31.260
Why are you doing this to me?

167
00:11:35.089 --> 00:11:36.229
When...

168
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.400
I thought I was going to die,

169
00:11:40.369 --> 00:11:41.400
I could see then...

170
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.300
what I was doing...

171
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.739
to others for my own selfish good.

172
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.280
That's what you said...

173
00:11:51.579 --> 00:11:53.050
to Doctor Park's wife.

174
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.550
You said that there are more days to live than the days we have lived.

175
00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:03.319
We don't know how to go back anyway.

Jin Joo.

177
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.199
Let's forget everything...

178
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:14.400
and continue living here with your mother.

179
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:17.069
What?

180
00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:20.739
I thought I could make it work if I was sincere to you.

181
00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:21.939
But it wasn't like that.

182
00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:25.709
I don't think I can make you happy.

183
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.579
What about Seo Jin?

184
00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:35.589
What about Seo Jin?

185
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.130
Are you...

186
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.930
giving up on him?

187
00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:49.300
Are you?

188
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.040
To me,

189
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.239
you, who is my heart, are more important...

190
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.680
than my son, who has filled up my mind.

191

We found this at the scene of the accident.

192
00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:23.900
Is it yours?

193
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.380
Yes.

194
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.500
Seo Jin.

195
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.140
I like being in your arms the most.

196
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.109
Why are you so adorable these days?

197
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:07.910
Let's go.

198
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.619
Daddy's so sorry.

199
00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:33.040
I'm sorry, Seo Jin.

200
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.280
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:48.790
Jin Joo is stuck to you like glue today as well.

202
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.410
Jin Joo, why are you crying?

203
00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:32.530
Jin Joo. Jin Joo, wake up.

204
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:38.640
Someone's at the door.

205
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.339
Who?

206
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:42.640
A man.

207
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.660
What is this about? You didn't even call me.

208
00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:08.630
What? I...

209
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.000
If I had called you to play with me, you would've refused.

210
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.209
I... I'm not feeling well today.

211
00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:17.479
It's my birthday today.

212
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.579
Just hang out with me for a day.

213
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:31.160
That's him. The chairman's son.

214
00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:34.089
He looks rich, doesn't he?

215
00:16:44.199 --> 00:16:45.199
I give up.

216
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.410
I give up.

217
00:16:54.849 --> 00:16:56.579
Bo Reum, wait for me!

218
00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.489
Slow down, Sul. You might fall.

219
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.189
I won't.

220
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.420
Are you practicing again?

221
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.819
You said you have nationals soon.

222
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.990
Yes.

223
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.290
You'll be the center again, right?

224
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.730
I don't know that.

225
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.060
I need to take the audition.

226
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.800
Gosh, you're being humble.

227
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.569
If you don't, who can?

228
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.399
It'll be nice...

229
00:17:15.399 --> 00:17:17.399
if Jae Woo gets better and becomes your partner.

230
00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:21.310
That can't happen in just a few days.

231
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.409
It's fine.

You're good. You did great,

237
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.929
but you can't be the center. You'll be a part of the ensemble.

All right. Thank you.

239
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:49.169
Well done.

240
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.510
It seems like you're the only candidate for the center.

241
00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.510
Next?

242
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.609
Yes.

243
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.119
What? You're going too?

244
00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:09.589
I could at least take the audition, right?

245
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.260

Is it weird to want to be partners with my boyfriend?

to get to where I am.

297
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.369
The process is more important than the result.

298
00:21:49.639 --> 00:21:51.579
If you can't reach me after trying so hard, I can go.

You're very good.

315
00:22:46.329 --> 00:22:47.500
Tteokbokki?

316
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.109
You really prepared this yourself? Sundae?

317
00:22:55.169 --> 00:22:57.780
I can believe that you made some gimbap,

318
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:59.280
but not tteokbokki and sundae.

319
00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:01.109
You bought these.

320
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:02.879
Yes.

321
00:23:02.879 --> 00:23:03.980
I said I prepared them myself.

322
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.579
I didn't say I cooked.

323
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.050
Oh, sure.

324
00:23:08.319 --> 00:23:09.419
But still,

325
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.089
I put them in the lunch box myself.

326
00:23:20.169 --> 00:23:22.030
You can pop the sides on some of them.

327
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.399
Make it look homemade.

328

Yes, all right.

329
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.909
I'm making them look sloppy on purpose.

330
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.980
You can just bring them.

331
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.950
You didn't have to put these in a lunch box.

332
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.450
You were going to tell me the truth anyway.

333
00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:39.079
I didn't put them in there to lie to you.

334
00:23:39.619 --> 00:23:41.889
I wanted to make it feel more like a picnic.

335
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.990
Like Mom's lunch box.

336
00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.030

This is good.

339
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.569
Have some.

340
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.250
This is good.

00:24:27.929 --> 00:24:30.899
We didn't want to go to class, so I brought all of them here.

346
00:24:32.369 --> 00:24:33.869
Goodness.

347
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.210
Are you okay?

348
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.839
Finals are coming up soon.

349
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.579
Why did you get into a car accident?

350
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:42.149
I'm not okay. This really hurts.

351
00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:43.980
I heard you had a surgery.

352
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.750
Read these if you get bored.

353
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.089
Anyway, what's that?

354
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.889
Oh, this?

355
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:54.629
This isn't yours.

356
00:24:56.359 --> 00:24:57.429
It's ours.

357
00:24:57.599 --> 00:24:58.659
What is it?

358
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.669
My goodness.

359
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.040
You're all something.

360
00:25:06.569 --> 00:25:08.839
How did you think of getting this on your way to a hospital?

361
00:25:09.069 --> 00:25:10.510
I know you're all very young,

362
00:25:10.639 --> 00:25:12.540
but you really have no common sense.

363
00:25:12.609 --> 00:25:13.649
Hey.

364
00:25:13.649 --> 00:25:17.349
If you have common sense, stop taking that. You're sick.

365
00:25:17.419 --> 00:25:19.149
It's not manners to alcohol...

366
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:20.649
to not have any when you're in front of it.

367
00:25:21.089 --> 00:25:22.290
It's your fault for bringing this.

368
00:25:22.819 --> 00:25:23.889
While we're at it,

369
00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:25.260
- let's make a toast! - Cheers!

370
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.460
- Gosh. - All right!

371
00:25:29.429 --> 00:25:31.760
We had to get some because of him.

372
00:25:38.099 --> 00:25:40.139
Stop crying. You look awful.

373
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.669
You should be honored to do something for your country.

374
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:43.940
You're annoying.

375
00:25:44.339 --> 00:25:45.409
You'll be...

376
00:25:46.409 --> 00:25:47.510
What about me?

377
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.750
I can't serve in the army. I'm an only child.

378
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.419
What did this country ever do for me anyway?

379
00:25:53.089 --> 00:25:55.119
I don't want to go!

380
00:25:55.819 --> 00:25:57.020
No, forget it.

381
00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:58.919
It's okay.

382
00:25:58.919 --> 00:26:00.730
Two years will pass by in a flash.

383
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.000
Yes, we'll hang out with you even when we become juniors.

384
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.260
Leave him alone.

385
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.069
It won't be any use no matter what you say.

386
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.569
He'll need to deal with that time.

387
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.970
He's a part of the sensitive forces now.

388
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.940
Not the reserve forces?

389
00:26:16.139 --> 00:26:19.649
It begins with the draft notice, until you actually get enlisted.

390
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:22.480
Stage one.

391
00:26:23.379 --> 00:26:24.879
- Denial. - Denial?

392
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.550
No, this is wrong.

393
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.460
I know I was born early, but I can't get drafted now.

394
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.159
Something is definitely wrong.

395
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.359
Stage two.

396
00:26:37.399 --> 00:26:38.560
Anger.

397
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.270
Why me?

398
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.169
Why did it have to be me?

399
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.369
You and you weren't drafted.

400
00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:45.470
Why do I have to go first?

401
00:26:48.639 --> 00:26:50.780
Stage three. Compromise.

402
00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.280
Stage four. Depression.

403
00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.119
Ban Do.

404
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.919
You can take this.

405
00:27:02.319 --> 00:27:04.319
- A soldier can't wear a necklace. - Sure.

406
00:27:04.659 --> 00:27:06.560
Sul. This isn't jerky.

407
00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:08.490
Bo Reum.

408
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.929
Tie your hair with this. This is limited-edition.

409
00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.159
I'll talk to you later.

410
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.200
The final stage.

411
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.770
Acceptance. Acknowledgement.

412
00:27:19.099 --> 00:27:20.210
Hey.

413
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:21.869
What's he doing now?

414
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.879
He's memorizing your phone numbers.

415
00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:26.179
What?

416
00:27:26.349 --> 00:27:28.109
Hey, don't you dare call me.

417
00:27:28.109 --> 00:27:30.079
I'll block you right away.

418
00:27:38.889 --> 00:27:39.929
Don't pity me.

419
00:27:44.099 --> 00:27:46.800
I heard you got hurt trying to save Jin Joo.

420
00:27:47.829 --> 00:27:49.329
It could've been really bad, right?

421
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.040
It wasn't that bad.

422
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.040
It could've been really bad.

423
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.579
The crazy love of Ban Do.

424
00:27:56.579 --> 00:27:57.909
He even put out his life.

425
00:27:58.179 --> 00:27:59.280
What?

426
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.579
Whose love are you talking about?

427
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.079
The love between you and Jin Joo.

428
00:28:05.419 --> 00:28:06.649
Didn't you know?

429
00:28:07.119 --> 00:28:09.119
You and Jin Joo like each other.

430
00:28:10.359 --> 00:28:11.619
Didn't you guys know?

431
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.819
We did.

432
00:28:13.429 --> 00:28:14.889
You'd be a fool not to know.

433
00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:22.629
Let's go.

434
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:26.839
Hey.

435
00:28:28.639 --> 00:28:30.609
Thank you for that day.

436
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.349
The day of the accident. You called the 911 for us.

437
00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:38.720
I didn't help him to be thanked by you. Why are you thanking me?

438
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.919
He should be thankful.

439
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.560
Well,

440
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.060
he's my friend. That's why.

441
00:28:48.329 --> 00:28:50.560
The last time, I saved you,

442
00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:53.300
but Choi Ban Do,

443
00:28:54.369 --> 00:28:55.730
that guy came and thanked me.

444
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.740
What?

445
00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.440
When you should thank me,

446
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.139
he thanked me.

447
00:29:02.339 --> 00:29:03.740
And when he should thank me,

448
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.980
you thanked me.

449
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.919
I wonder what's so heartbreaking for you two.

450
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.349
I don't even have a chance.

451
00:29:16.589 --> 00:29:17.960
- Hey... - Let's go.

452
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.690
There's another place I want to go.

453
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:36.579
Excuse me, ma'am.

454
00:29:37.139 --> 00:29:40.010
What brings you to a market instead of a department store?

455
00:29:40.849 --> 00:29:43.480
I heard the food is fresh here, so I decided to check it out.

456
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.679
I see.

457
00:29:46.819 --> 00:29:48.250
Give me some small anchovies.

458
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.560
You bought a lot the last time. Did you finish them already?

459
00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.790
My kids won't eat breakfast, you know.

460
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.060
But I made them rice balls with some anchovies,

461
00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.129
and they liked it.

462
00:29:57.159 --> 00:29:59.829
Really? Maybe I should do that for my kids too.

463
00:30:00.329 --> 00:30:03.169
- They never want to eat breakfast. - Exactly.

464
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:04.399
Give me some more.

465
00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:06.310
My gosh.

466
00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.710
- Take it. - Okay.

467
00:30:13.379 --> 00:30:14.950
It's really small to me now.

468
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:16.780
The playground.

469
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.119
It's nothing much.

470
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.720
It's a playground. Of course, it's nothing much.

471
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.659
Did you think there would be a ghost?

472
00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:28.829
It was the one place I dreaded the most.

473
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.030
The playground?

474
00:30:31.159 --> 00:30:32.260
Yes.

475
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.129
When you're a kid, you'd be playing here.

476
00:30:36.069 --> 00:30:39.240
Then your friends will leave one by one when their moms come.

477
00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:42.470
But I was always left alone in an empty playground.

478
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.810
It was scary how my friends leave me one by one...

479
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:50.919
and how no one would come even if I continued to wait.

480
00:30:52.819 --> 00:30:54.119
That's why I never came here.

481
00:30:55.649 --> 00:30:57.560
It's not like I asked for much.

482
00:30:59.389 --> 00:31:01.460
I wanted what everyone else had. I just wanted a normal life.

483
00:31:03.099 --> 00:31:04.099
Mom.

484
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:08.030
That's the only thing I wished for.

485
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:10.639
But she wouldn't do that for me.

486
00:31:15.869 --> 00:31:17.740
Just because everyone does it,

487
00:31:18.079 --> 00:31:19.710
and because it's a normal thing to do,

488
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.210
doesn't mean it's easy.

489
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:24.720
Living as a mom...

490
00:31:26.589 --> 00:31:29.589
looks like a simple thing that everyone does,

491
00:31:30.589 --> 00:31:32.960
but actually it's something incredible.

492
00:31:34.089 --> 00:31:35.490
It feels like...

493
00:31:35.889 --> 00:31:37.230
your past, present, and future...

494
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.200
are disappearing.

495
00:31:41.129 --> 00:31:42.629
And your existence...

496
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.200
in this world...

497
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.940
seems useless...

498
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.139
and insignificant.

499
00:31:59.319 --> 00:32:01.790
Gosh, it's hot.

500
00:32:15.569 --> 00:32:19.270
You're pressured to become...

501
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.470
the strongest person in the world.

502
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.079
It's not easy.

503
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.710
You're doing something profound.

504
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:32.220
It's not that your mom didn't do it,

505
00:32:32.649 --> 00:32:34.250
she probably couldn't.

506
00:32:35.889 --> 00:32:37.490
Because she's human.

507
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.730
I don't know what to make of you.

508
00:32:45.859 --> 00:32:47.500
But being with you...

509
00:32:47.869 --> 00:32:49.000
makes me at ease.

510
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.710
You make me feel like I'm a warm person.

511
00:32:55.639 --> 00:32:57.409
Now that I really like you,

512
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.280
I finally realize...

513
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:02.849
where your heart is.

514
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.359
Ban Do. No...

515
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.790
Honey!

516
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.859
Honey.

517
00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.470
Get up.

518
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.399
Get up!

519
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.770
I better...

520
00:33:29.579 --> 00:33:31.179
tell you this now.

521
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.819
I...

522
00:33:38.419 --> 00:33:39.990
really like you a lot.

523
00:33:44.819 --> 00:33:46.089
I just want you to know that.

524
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.460
You don't even know that you're pretty.

525

526
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:10.619
Thank you...

527
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.480
for liking me.

528
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.619
Thanks for letting me know that I'm still...

529
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.889
a woman.

530
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.799
By the way, you don't know yourself.

531
00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.170
You don't know what a warm-hearted person you are.

532
00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:31.040
- What? - You just don't realize it.

533
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.139
A crying kitten.

534
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:34.940
Lonely people.

535
00:34:36.779 --> 00:34:39.980
You notice people's wounds.

536
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.610
You aren't ill-tempered.

537
00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.549
You aren't twisted.

538
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:48.849
You grew up well.

539
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.679
Today isn't your birthday, is it?

540
00:35:11.739 --> 00:35:13.980
- What? - I saw your ID earlier...

541
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.480
when you dropped your wallet.

542
00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.520
Then am I your first love?

543
00:35:20.989 --> 00:35:21.989
Does that make you happy?

544
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.719
Kind of.

545
00:35:24.719 --> 00:35:28.130
It's nice to be someone's first love.

546
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.659
It feels good to have someone...

547
00:35:30.659 --> 00:35:34.570
who is rooting for you without even knowing it.

548
00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.199
It's nice.

549
00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.340
You were like that to me before.

550
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.509
And you're still like that.

551
00:35:43.409 --> 00:35:45.040
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

552
00:35:49.579 --> 00:35:50.619
I'll take you home.

553
00:35:51.219 --> 00:35:52.250
It's okay.

554
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.659
It'll be perfect to say goodbye here.

555
00:35:57.659 --> 00:36:01.460
Also I don't want to leave you here alone.

556
00:36:01.889 --> 00:36:03.659
So you should go.

557
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:09.270
All right.

558
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.270
Bye.

559
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.599
- Jin Joo. - Yes, Mom?

560
00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:19.940
Where have you been?

561
00:37:20.369 --> 00:37:21.840
Did you go somewhere nice?

562
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.480
Well... I went to Han River...

563
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.679
and other places.

564
00:37:27.409 --> 00:37:28.449
Jin Joo.

565
00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:29.820
Yes?

566
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.250
Do you want to have a drink with me?

567
00:37:32.849 --> 00:37:33.849
What?

568
00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.820
This is nice.

569
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.060
I didn't know you drank.

570
00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.159
I've never seen you drink before.

571
00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:43.460
Of course!

572
00:37:43.659 --> 00:37:45.099
I could drink...

573
00:37:45.099 --> 00:37:48.429
better than any man in my neighborhood.

574
00:37:48.429 --> 00:37:50.599
That's interesting.

575
00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:53.409
It turns out that you're good at dancing,

576
00:37:53.409 --> 00:37:55.509
singing,

577
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.279
and drinking.

578
00:37:57.739 --> 00:38:00.079
I was a born dancer, singer, and drinker.

579
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:08.849
You're pretty.

580
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.590
You're so pretty.

581
00:38:12.759 --> 00:38:14.929
What? Me?

582
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:16.699
Yes.

583
00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.560
I really wanted to tell you that.

584
00:38:25.699 --> 00:38:27.340
You're pretty too.

585
00:38:28.409 --> 00:38:29.840
You're so pretty.

586
00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:32.909
Of course. I'm your daughter.

587
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:42.190
- Don't look at me - Don't look at me

588

- With those sad eyes - With those sad eyes

589
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:53.369
- The days are gone - The days are gone

590
00:38:54.299 --> 00:38:59.299
- But I won't forget them - But I won't forget them

591
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:05.279
- When it rains like today - When it rains like today

592
00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:09.210
- The old memories - The old memories

593
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:13.090
- Will come back to me - Will come back to me

594
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:17.820
- Don't look at me - Don't look at me

595
00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:23.960
- With those sad eyes - With those sad eyes

596
00:39:24.799 --> 00:39:29.469
- The days are gone - The days are gone

597
00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:35.210
- But I won't forget them - But I won't forget them

598
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:38.810
You're the best.

599
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.250
You're a singer.

600
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:50.759
Jin Joo.

601
00:39:52.119 --> 00:39:53.130
Yes?

602
00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.259
My pretty daughter.

603
00:39:57.159 --> 00:39:58.159
Yes.

604
00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.630
I'm your pretty daughter.

605
00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:07.170
You should...

606
00:40:09.469 --> 00:40:11.409
go back to your baby now.

607
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:24.790
Mom.

608
00:40:28.889 --> 00:40:30.799
Come out, honey. You said your hands and feet hurt.

609
00:40:30.799 --> 00:40:31.960
I'll massage them for you.

610
00:40:32.259 --> 00:40:34.170
- Let me finish cleaning first. - Okay.

611
00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:46.549
(Dear Mom)

612
00:40:48.449 --> 00:40:49.619
She's acting strange.

613
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.320
Your birthday is coming up.

614
00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.880
I guess it's because of that.

615
00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:57.060

616
00:41:01.389 --> 00:41:03.130

00:41:09.299 --> 00:41:11.770
(Mom's voice)

618
00:41:37.429 --> 00:41:38.500
Mom?

619
00:41:39.159 --> 00:41:40.929
You've never been in my dreams.

620
00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:42.599
I'm lucky today.

621
00:41:46.099 --> 00:41:47.670
It was nice to see you again.

622
00:41:48.509 --> 00:41:49.639
Mom.

623
00:42:02.049 --> 00:42:03.119
Oh, my.

624
00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:05.960
Gosh, she's so pretty.

625
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.029
You would...

626
00:42:07.929 --> 00:42:10.400
love to see my son.

627
00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:18.239
Seo Jin.

628
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.310
Seo Jin.

629
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:21.810
Seo Jin.

630
00:42:22.409 --> 00:42:23.509
Seo Jin.

631
00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:30.520
You've been through a lot.

632
00:42:32.179 --> 00:42:34.320
Thank you for giving birth to me.

633
00:42:50.599 --> 00:42:51.840
Go to a club.

634
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.270
Go to a public bath with Mom.

635
00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.639
Go to a karaoke with Mom.

636
00:42:57.639 --> 00:42:59.380
Drink with Mom.

637
00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:02.380
Say goodbye...

638
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.079
to Mom.

639
00:43:07.389 --> 00:43:09.590
Who is this Seo Jin?

640
00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.989
You must have liked him so much.

641
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.190
Mom.

642
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.889
Yes? Tell me.

643
00:43:15.889 --> 00:43:17.099
Let's go to a public bath.

644
00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.099
I'll scrub your back.

645
00:43:20.099 --> 00:43:21.230
What?

646
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.540
One's mind flows like water

647
00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.670
Mom.

648
00:43:26.369 --> 00:43:27.639
Do you want to go to a karaoke?

649
00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.790
I don't know what's happening.

650
00:43:42.989 --> 00:43:45.020
I don't know what this is.

651
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.730
But I know this.

652
00:43:49.929 --> 00:43:51.900
You can live without your parents,

653
00:43:53.199 --> 00:43:55.099
but you can't live without your child.

654
00:44:02.369 --> 00:44:03.710
You don't need to cry.

655
00:44:05.639 --> 00:44:09.150
Deal with whatever makes you sad.

656
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.250
You'll become hard.

657
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.790
That's how it is.

658
00:44:15.849 --> 00:44:17.159
I can't become hard.

659
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.529
I can't get used to it.

660
00:44:22.529 --> 00:44:23.829
I'm constantly sad.

661
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.099
I miss you constantly.

662
00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:30.799
How can I do that?

663
00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.509
Mom.

664
00:44:39.909 --> 00:44:41.610
You can do it...

665
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:43.980
if you raise a child.

666
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.349
You can do it.

667
00:44:54.429 --> 00:44:55.489
Mom.

668
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.650
Mom. Mom.

669
00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:39.639
Where are you going?

670
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:42.570
I need some fresh air.

671
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:43.880
I'll walk around for a bit.

672
00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.219
Don't go too far.

673
00:45:56.049 --> 00:45:57.860
Can we go home now?

674
00:45:58.619 --> 00:46:00.489
Yes, we're going home now.

675
00:46:30.389 --> 00:46:32.320

Let's go.

681
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.000
Let's go home.

682
00:47:45.199 --> 00:47:46.369
Are you going to school?

683
00:47:49.799 --> 00:47:51.699
- Yes. - Your father...

00:47:52.239 --> 00:47:53.509
is going to retire.

685
00:47:54.239 --> 00:47:56.610
You don't need to worry about it.

686
00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:58.440
Okay.

687
00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:01.210
Will you be okay without breakfast?

688
00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:02.920
Yes, I'll be fine.

689
00:48:05.049 --> 00:48:06.320
Then take this.

690
00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:12.520

Don't get nervous. I'm here.

Next,

696
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:58.239
it's the cheerleading squad from Hankook University, Asura.

Bo Reum! Bo Reum! Yoon Bo Reum!

701
00:50:24.659 --> 00:50:26.759
They don't go along well together,

702
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.560
but somehow, they look nice together.

703
00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.929
Bo Reum is out of his league,

704
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:32.659
but I don't want them to part.

705

Me neither.

706
00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:37.469
They should date forever, until they die.

- Ahn Jae Woo! - Yoon Bo Reum!

708

Sir, please.

712
00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:15.770
Make it look good.

713
00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:18.810
Please make it look as good as possible.

714
00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:21.049
You're shaving your head. I can't make you look good.

715
00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:22.250
Oh, no.

716
00:51:28.489 --> 00:51:29.520
That hurts.

717
00:51:31.219 --> 00:51:34.989
I was born as a man

One for you, Jin Joo.

726
00:52:30.719 --> 00:52:32.520
Honey, what about me?

727
00:52:32.989 --> 00:52:34.020
Eat whatever's there.

728
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.020
I'll cook it for you again later.

729

Eat up.

730
00:52:40.329 --> 00:52:42.259
Yes, thank you.

Yes?

If that's the case,

738
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.630
take good care of your dad.

739
00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:23.699
What?

740
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.070
How...

741
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.810
would your dad live without me?

742
00:53:54.969 --> 00:53:56.940
Go visit him from time to time,

743
00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.840
have a drink with him,

744
00:54:01.239 --> 00:54:03.440
and bring Seo Jin around often too.

745
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.179
Will you do that?

746
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:09.210
Father.

747
00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.190
I brought your favorite, skate.

748
00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:18.659
Why did you do that?

749
00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.860
I know you don't want to get remarried.

750
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:22.829
Jin Joo's mom...

751
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:26.199
asked me to not live a lonely life.

752
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.869
That's why I said that.

753
00:54:34.509 --> 00:54:36.540
Please take care of your dad.

754
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:08.770
Hey.

755
00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:11.610
I have a question.

756
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.909
May I ask?

757
00:55:14.909 --> 00:55:15.909
Ask away.

758
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:17.250
What is it?

759
00:55:18.119 --> 00:55:20.549
Why did Bo Reum and Jae Woo break up?

760
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:22.250
What?

761
00:55:24.889 --> 00:55:27.560
Hey, we're about to leave.

762
00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:28.960
And that's the question you ask?

763
00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:31.659
You know nothing about romance. Goodness.

764
00:55:31.659 --> 00:55:33.199
I mean, I got more curious...

765
00:55:33.199 --> 00:55:36.469
after seeing how lovey-dovey they were here.

766
00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:38.670
What is it?

767
00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:41.869
Bo Reum is infertile.

768
00:55:42.239 --> 00:55:43.679
She can't have babies.

769
00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:50.179
Oh, I see.

770
00:55:51.679 --> 00:55:54.119
But still, why didn't she say so?

771
00:55:54.849 --> 00:55:56.659
Why did she leave him like that?

772
00:55:56.659 --> 00:55:58.460
Jae Woo is an only child of three generation.

773
00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.790
How can she tell him that?

774
00:56:01.529 --> 00:56:03.400
She just let him go...

775
00:56:04.299 --> 00:56:05.900
for him to meet someone better.

776
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.940
So that's why you comforted her so much.

777
00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:11.500
I knew the reason.

778
00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:16.210
It wasn't easy for us to meet our son too.

779
00:56:18.679 --> 00:56:19.849
You're right.

780
00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:24.049
Shall we go, then?

781
00:56:24.849 --> 00:56:26.290
Let's go meet Seo Jin.

782
00:56:57.619 --> 00:56:59.119
Shall we kiss?

783
00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:20.469
I love you.

784
00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:23.610
Me too.

785
00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.889
Seo Jin. Seo Jin.

786
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:42.250
Seo Jin.

787
00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:45.159
My son, Mommy is here.

788
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.860
Mommy is here, Seo Jin.

789
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:53.099
Mommy is here.

790
00:59:01.909 --> 00:59:03.079
Honey.

791
00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.049
Seo Jin.

792
00:59:09.009 --> 00:59:10.119
Let me have him.

793
00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.820
Mommy, Mommy.

794
00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:20.829
Come here.

795
00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:24.099
Ban Do said that...

796
00:59:24.929 --> 00:59:29.639
we might have taken a short trip.

797
00:59:30.639 --> 00:59:32.199
And that we go on a trip...

798
00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:34.070
to return home...

799
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:36.279
and to cherish and love...

800
00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:37.980
what we have.

801
00:59:40.949 --> 00:59:42.480
How much do you make in a year?

802
00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:45.349
That must be very important to you.

803
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:47.849
Of course. We aren't here for a date. We're discussing a marriage.

804
00:59:47.849 --> 00:59:49.690
Then you must make quite a lot.

805
00:59:51.119 --> 00:59:53.730
My dream is to become a housewife.

806
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:57.130
A housewife.

807
00:59:57.299 --> 01:00:00.500
I believe the life of a lawyer is in their looks.

808
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.469
So that's why I always use a facial mask a day.

809
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.070
But it looks like you don't manage your looks.

810
01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:08.070
You have a lot of wrinkles on your neck.

811
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:10.239
What a crazy guy.

812
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.380
Hey.

813
01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:16.980
Are you challenging me?

814
01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.049
You look like a wasted gum.

815
01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:21.420
How dare you tell me that I have wrinkles?

816
01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.119
I don't believe you.

817
01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:25.590
My gosh, you really got me worked up.

818
01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.090
What do you want?

819
01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.469
Let's go, Seo Jin. Let's go.

820
01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.940
- Let's go. - Come in.

821
01:00:43.779 --> 01:00:47.049
Goodness, you're so adorable.

822
01:00:47.049 --> 01:00:48.380
Peek-a-boo.

823
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:51.119
- My baby, you're so adorable. - Mommy.

824
01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:54.290
- Do you want Mommy? - This.

825
01:00:54.489 --> 01:00:56.389
- This? - Do you like that?

826
01:00:56.389 --> 01:00:58.820
Put him down. You'll get tired.

827
01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.790
Give him to me. He's too heavy for you.

828
01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:02.730
It's okay. I can hold him.

829
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.599
I waited all week to see him.

830
01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:06.900
Right, Seo Jin?

831
01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:12.299
Shouldn't she be here soon?

832
01:01:13.409 --> 01:01:14.409
I know.

833
01:01:16.009 --> 01:01:18.009
Really? They're back together?

834
01:01:18.079 --> 01:01:19.409
They're getting married.

835
01:01:19.679 --> 01:01:21.210
Bo Reum and Jae Woo.

836
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:23.150
Gosh.

837
01:01:23.619 --> 01:01:26.049
I guess they were destined to be together.

838
01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.420
What about having kids then?

839
01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:30.290
They won't have kids.

840
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.489
They said they'd travel and live freely.

841
01:01:33.889 --> 01:01:35.159
That's cool.

842
01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.630
By the way,

843
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:38.599
we went back and went through all that,

844
01:01:38.599 --> 01:01:40.000
but we're still the same.

845
01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:42.329
- Nothing changed. - I know.

846
01:01:45.639 --> 01:01:47.270
You said your parents were coming.

847
01:01:47.639 --> 01:01:48.770
They'll be here soon.

848
01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:53.210
- What a nice car. - It's an expensive one.

849
01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:02.549
- Hey. What? - What?

850
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:05.520
- Mr. Kim. Wait outside. - Yes, sir.

851
01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.730
Mom.

852
01:02:07.989 --> 01:02:09.029
What...

853
01:02:12.659 --> 01:02:15.170
Why are you staring?

854
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.570
Well...

855
01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:18.869
What's up with your clothes?

856
01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:20.110
And this car?

857
01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:22.040
What? What about our clothes?

858
01:02:22.509 --> 01:02:23.610
What's wrong?

859
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.710
Aren't those expensive?

860
01:02:26.179 --> 01:02:27.549
Do you have money to burn or something?

861
01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:28.849
You punk.

862
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:31.619
Yes. I have money to burn.

863
01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:35.320
Are you trying to tell me that you're the one who made me rich?

864
01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:37.889
What?

865
01:02:38.659 --> 01:02:40.029
Did you...

866
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560
Pangyo?

867
01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.329
Come on, Ban Do.

868
01:02:43.329 --> 01:02:45.130
You told us to invest.

869
01:02:49.639 --> 01:02:51.500
Yes. It worked.

870
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:54.139
Dad. Are we rich then?

871
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:57.940
Then why are we still living in that small apartment?

872
01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.440
You punk.

873
01:02:59.579 --> 01:03:02.409
I'm rich, not you.

874
01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:04.320
Gosh.

875
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.849
Where is everyone? Let's go in.

876
01:03:08.049 --> 01:03:09.049
Goodness.

877
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:12.759
I forgot to bring kimchi for them.

878
01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.560
Why am I so forgetful these days?

879
01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.230
Am I getting Alzheimer's?

880
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:18.529
Alzheimer's my foot.

881
01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:20.799
We aren't even 70 yet.

882
01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:23.000
We're still young.

883
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:26.040
If I get Alzheimer's,

884
01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:27.810
send me to a nursing home.

885
01:03:27.969 --> 01:03:29.340
Send you to a nursing home?

886
01:03:30.179 --> 01:03:31.239
No way.

887
01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.579
You have me.

888
01:03:34.579 --> 01:03:37.219
I can carry you on my back.

889
01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.520
Let's go.

890
01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:42.119
All right, honey.

891
01:03:59.199 --> 01:04:02.469
My baby. You're smiling because you like me.

892
01:04:02.469 --> 01:04:03.739
Goodness.

893
01:04:04.239 --> 01:04:07.049
No. He smiled because he looked at me.

894
01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.279
Right?

895
01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:09.619
Peek-a-boo.

896
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.049
No, he looked into my eyes.

897
01:04:14.989 --> 01:04:17.060
And then he smiled.

898
01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.219
No, he looked at me.

899
01:04:21.889 --> 01:04:22.929
Mineral spring.

900
01:04:24.659 --> 01:04:25.960
Right, Seo Jin?

901
01:04:26.099 --> 01:04:29.369
You smiled at me every day, right?

902
01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.469
- Look at him. - Honey.

903
01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:33.040
Let's move.

904
01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.139
Let's move next to their place.

905
01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:38.110
What are you saying?

906
01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.449
- Goodness. - Mineral spring.

907
01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:42.710
Peek-a-boo.

908
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:44.719
Hi, honey.

909
01:04:45.219 --> 01:04:46.320
I'm sorry.

910
01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:50.119
I can't go home again because of a conference.

911
01:04:50.759 --> 01:04:54.489
I'm sorry. I have a date with my wife today.

912
01:04:55.429 --> 01:04:58.429
You've been married for so long. Do you still love her that much?

913
01:04:58.659 --> 01:05:00.130
Of course.

914
01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:03.239
She is pretty and kind. To me, she's perfect.

915
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.340
Yes.

916
01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:12.949
Honey.

917
01:05:17.779 --> 01:05:18.949
Honey.

918
01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:20.849
My wife is here. Bye.

919
01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:26.259
- Hi, honey. - Have you been waiting long?

920
01:05:26.259 --> 01:05:27.259
No.

921
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.829
- Have you eaten yet? - No, not yet.

922
01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:31.929
- Aren't you cold? - No, I'm okay.

923
01:05:32.099 --> 01:05:33.099
What do you want to eat?

924
01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:34.429
Well...

925
01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.070
- Anything. - Anything?

926
01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:40.239
- Let's have steak. - Okay!

927
01:05:40.239 --> 01:05:41.270
Okay!

928
01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.980
- Honey. - Honey, what are you doing?

929
01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:45.139
- Shall we kiss first? - Kiss? Okay.

930
01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.009
- Do you know her? - What?

931
01:05:48.849 --> 01:05:50.349
Well... No...

Hi. Is it you, Sul?

934
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:12.440
Where are you?

935
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.840
I'm in Madagascar.

936
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:15.310
Did you receive my book?

937
01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.940
Yes.

938
01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:18.980
You're amazing, Sul.

939
01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:21.710
Great. I'll call you when I'm back in Korea.

940
01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:23.219
Okay.

941
01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:30.360
Who was it?

942
01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.960
- Was it Sul? - Yes.

943
01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:33.889
Well...

944
01:06:33.929 --> 01:06:36.460
Mada... What did she say?

945
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:39.360
It ends with "car". She's somewhere there.

946
01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.699
That's amazing.

947
01:06:40.799 --> 01:06:43.599
She was the most soft-hearted, but she's a tough woman now.

948
01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:44.799
I know.

949
01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.670
Aren't you proud of her?

950
01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:53.810
Hello?

951
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:56.380
- Yes? - I'm calling from the court.

952
01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.880
If you don't submit the divorce papers...

953
01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.590
to the district office within three months, they'll be nullified.

954
01:07:02.449 --> 01:07:03.489
Okay.

955
01:07:03.759 --> 01:07:04.860
Okay.

956
01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:17.199
- Hey. - Il Won.

957
01:07:18.739 --> 01:07:20.139
Wait for daddy.

958
01:07:21.139 --> 01:07:22.170
All right.

959
01:07:24.909 --> 01:07:26.409
It's dangerous to go off alone.

Mommy's here.

963
01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:53.310
Someone who will courageously...

964
01:07:53.639 --> 01:07:56.110
stand by my side forever without hesitation...

965
01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:00.049
when I have to face the world.

966
01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.980
We survive in this tough world...

967
01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.349

When two strangers are living together,

how can it always be good?

972
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:28.009
It's not like we're divinities who have mastered everything.

973
01:08:30.879 --> 01:08:32.440
What did you just say, woman?

974
01:08:34.049 --> 01:08:35.910
I called you a cheapskate, Cheapskate.

975
01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:37.849
How rude.

976
01:08:38.219 --> 01:08:40.849
How dare you call me...

977
01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:44.719
I'm a divine being. What's wrong with you?

978
01:08:44.719 --> 01:08:46.490
You're my husband.

979
01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:47.889
And I'm a divine being too.

980

You aren't the only one.

981
01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:52.560
I married you because you begged me to marry you.

982
01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.200
How can you forget our wedding anniversary?

983
01:08:54.299 --> 01:08:56.129
You forgot because you don't want to buy me a gift.

984
01:08:56.129 --> 01:08:57.400
You cheapskate.

985
01:08:57.599 --> 01:09:00.169
Stop calling me cheapskate.

986
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.870
Do you know how miserable I am because I met you?

987
