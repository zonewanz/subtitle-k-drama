00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:55.414
Shi Kyung said he's studying with friends
for a performance assessment.

5
00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:56.714
Don't you need to?

6
00:00:56.714 --> 00:00:57.900
What do you mean?

7
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.094
Lee Shi Kyung is watching a movie
with his girlfriend.

8
00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:08.509
Seriously, that kid.

9
00:01:12.662 --> 00:01:14.577
So, that's Bom.

10
00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:16.788
Mom, you know Bom too?

11
00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:19.327
I've seen her at the hospital before.

12
00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:21.264
What's she like?

13
00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:23.049
I don't know her very well.

14
00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.684
From what I can tell,
she is smarter than Shi Kyung.

15
00:01:26.684 --> 00:01:28.509
She does better in school than Shi Kyung.

16
00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:31.083
That's a relief, at least.

17
00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.193
What does her father do?

18
00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:42.764
- What?
- What's with you adults?

19
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.097
You have to even if you don't want to.

20
00:01:53.097 --> 00:01:57.549
It may only be convulsions now,
but you could go into a coma.

21
00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.918
I really can't do it.

22
00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.749
I can do anything else but not that.

23
00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.100
Mrs. Shin Kyung Ae.

24
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.422
We understand why you feel this way.

25
00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:10.317
Still, you must get an enema
to stop these convulsions.

26
00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:12.918
You think you'll be able to talk
to your daughter with that hand?

27
00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.329
Why does my hand have to do this?

28
00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.131
No one will see.

29
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:25.150
I will be in here alone,
so you will feel at ease.

30
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.738
How can I feel at ease? How?

31
00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:49.455
You must like drip coffee.

32
00:02:50.493 --> 00:02:52.683
No, not me.

33
00:02:52.683 --> 00:02:54.785
The patient Song Kyung Ae requested it.

34
00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:58.195
I don't think she's allowed
to have coffee.

35
00:02:58.195 --> 00:02:59.214
What?

36
00:02:59.214 --> 00:03:03.648
When it comes to food and drinks,
you need to get the doctor's permission.

37
00:03:03.648 --> 00:03:06.397
Ah, I forgot.

38
00:03:06.397 --> 00:03:07.564
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:07.564 --> 00:03:10.063
What should I do then?
Should I put it away?

40
00:03:10.063 --> 00:03:12.783
No, just give it to me.

41
00:03:20.277 --> 00:03:22.934
Oh, what is that smell?

42
00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:31.635
Are you crazy? Why are you in here!

43
00:03:31.635 --> 00:03:33.756
I thought something happened
to you, Soo Bin's mom.

44
00:03:33.756 --> 00:03:36.675
What are you looking at?
Get out of here.

45
00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.194
Oh... yes.

46
00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:44.861
<i>What am I to do?</i>

47
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:48.141
Soo Bin, what is your mom going to do?

48
00:03:59.243 --> 00:04:01.478
<i>[Youth Art Show]</i>

49
00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:09.137
Do you know that painting?

50
00:04:09.137 --> 00:04:11.117
It's "The Scream" by Munch.

51
00:04:13.716 --> 00:04:15.831
After my children's father
went missing...

52
00:04:17.437 --> 00:04:20.611
I kept this painting by my side.

53
00:04:22.306 --> 00:04:23.409
Your husband?

54
00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:25.743
It has been over 10 years.

55
00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:33.455
I must have wanted to scream
like the person in this painting.

56
00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:38.289
I'm sorry about before.

57
00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:41.046
I was acting so crazy, wasn't I?

58
00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:43.875
I would've done the same.

59
00:04:48.385 --> 00:04:50.044
I'm craving coffee again.

60
00:04:51.387 --> 00:04:54.245
I bought beans.
Should I grind them for you?

61
00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:56.085
Could you?

62
00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:58.522
You can only enjoy the smell.

63
00:04:58.522 --> 00:05:00.935
Caffeine is not good for you right now.

64
00:05:20.517 --> 00:05:22.570
That movie was really fun, right?

65
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.493
You were funnier than the movie.

66
00:05:24.493 --> 00:05:25.962
Me?

67
00:05:25.962 --> 00:05:29.025
You have no idea how funny you look
when you laugh, do you?

68
00:05:29.025 --> 00:05:31.173
I've been told I look
very handsome when I laugh.

69
00:05:32.137 --> 00:05:33.191
Laugh.

70
00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:37.448
You see? It's funny.

71
00:05:40.183 --> 00:05:43.212
- What are you doing?
- Just enjoying my own private view.

72
00:05:43.212 --> 00:05:44.282
It's just something.

73
00:05:55.068 --> 00:05:57.128
Who is it that you're not answering?

74
00:05:57.128 --> 00:05:58.948
The president of a modeling agency.

75
00:05:58.948 --> 00:06:01.767
Why is the president of a
modeling agency calling you?

76
00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:04.299
I met him years ago on the street.

77
00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:07.301
He's been bothering me
about modeling ever since.

78
00:06:07.301 --> 00:06:12.611
Does he, perhaps... have
other motives toward you?

79
00:06:12.611 --> 00:06:13.662
Other motives?

80
00:06:13.662 --> 00:06:16.962
There are a lot of dark
and strange people out there.

81
00:06:16.962 --> 00:06:19.611
Isn't that why he's calling you?

82
00:06:21.072 --> 00:06:23.852
Give the phone to me
if he calls you again.

83
00:06:23.852 --> 00:06:26.887
What will you do if I give it to you?

84
00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:31.712
Once I pick up I will...

85
00:06:33.332 --> 00:06:34.601
Say he calls.

86
00:06:35.575 --> 00:06:37.510
Hello, uh...

87
00:06:38.313 --> 00:06:41.541
I'm from Violent Crimes
of the Gaon Police Department.

88
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:42.762
How can I help you?

89
00:06:43.714 --> 00:06:45.714
The president of a modeling agency?

90
00:06:47.953 --> 00:06:49.250
Oh, really.

91
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.032
- Forget it. Come on.
- What?

92
00:06:54.121 --> 00:06:57.914
"Gi Uk."

93
00:07:00.113 --> 00:07:03.263
Grandma, you sure like "Uk."

94
00:07:03.263 --> 00:07:05.644
It isn't "Uk." It's "Yeok."

95
00:07:05.644 --> 00:07:06.863
Like for the word seaweed.

96
00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:10.443
Okay, like for the word seaweed.

97
00:07:10.443 --> 00:07:13.551
Why didn't you say so to begin with?

98
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:14.983
"Yeok" like the word seaweed.

99
00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:18.373
What is this one?

100
00:07:18.373 --> 00:07:19.912
"Ni..."

101
00:07:25.354 --> 00:07:26.404
"Nyun."

102
00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:29.056
Oh, Grandma!

103
00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:31.087
This is "Nieun."

104
00:07:31.087 --> 00:07:33.529
Oh, it's not "Ni Nyun."

105
00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:35.238
- "Ni Eun."
- Why?

106
00:07:35.238 --> 00:07:37.291
"Stupid, dumb idiot."

107
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:39.385
"Eat crap and take a hike."

108
00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:41.804
You had no problem memorizing
those music lyrics.

109
00:07:41.804 --> 00:07:44.796
Why can't you memorize easy Korean?

110
00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:48.265
Because my old brain
is full of curse words.

111
00:07:48.265 --> 00:07:50.335
From now on, "Giyeok" and "Nieun."

112
00:07:50.335 --> 00:07:53.767
Read it out loud, and write it 20 times.

113
00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:55.844
20 times!

114
00:07:55.844 --> 00:07:58.568
That's how Dad taught Shi Kyung
how to read and write.

115
00:07:58.568 --> 00:08:02.686
If you can't memorize it,
read and write it until you can.

116
00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:05.358
I told you to stop calling
your older brother Shi Kyung.

117
00:08:05.358 --> 00:08:08.500
If you manage to learn all of this,
I'll call him "older brother."

118
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.142
You promise?

119
00:08:10.142 --> 00:08:11.152
Yes.

120
00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:19.544
"Ni...nyun."

121
00:08:19.544 --> 00:08:21.486
You are doing this out of spite.

122
00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:23.065
Stop picking on Grandma.

123
00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:24.318
Take care of your own problems.

124
00:08:24.318 --> 00:08:26.962
You told Mom you were studying
for our performance assessment.

125
00:08:26.962 --> 00:08:28.301
How did you know that?

126
00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:31.553
Mom came to town and
saw you two in the store.

127
00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:34.986
Really? You should have told me!

128
00:08:34.986 --> 00:08:37.313
She caught me
while I was taking out the trash.

129
00:08:38.122 --> 00:08:41.331
Was Mom mad? She didn't say anything?

130
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:44.390
She said something I can't repeat.

131
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.294
What am I supposed to tell Mom?

132
00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:49.640
Just tell her the truth.

133
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.167
"I like my girlfriend more than you."

134
00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:54.597
Hey, Mom would feel bad
if she heard me say that.

135
00:08:54.597 --> 00:08:56.928
Have you ever cared about Mom
when you have lied in the past?

136
00:08:56.928 --> 00:08:58.592
You only do it for your own comfort.

137
00:08:58.592 --> 00:09:01.592
That's not true!
I care about Mom, too.

138
00:09:01.592 --> 00:09:04.023
Sure, I'm sure you feel guilty, too.

139
00:09:04.023 --> 00:09:05.919
You wouldn't be human if you didn't.

140
00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:20.491
Lee Shi Kyung.

141
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.987
There you are.

142
00:09:29.467 --> 00:09:30.533
Eom Yong Gi.

143
00:09:31.536 --> 00:09:33.428
The music teacher wants to see you.

144
00:09:34.247 --> 00:09:37.823
I wonder if you and Shi Kyung should
just live in the consulting office.

145
00:09:37.823 --> 00:09:38.833
What?

146
00:09:39.491 --> 00:09:41.179
It's nothing.

147
00:09:41.179 --> 00:09:43.112
Get going. She's waiting.

148
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.381
What nonsense...

149
00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:49.630
Stop right there.

150
00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:53.813
What is it you want to say
that's making you take so long?

151
00:09:53.813 --> 00:09:57.225
I said some really nonsensical
things last time.

152
00:09:57.225 --> 00:09:58.307
So, you know.

153
00:09:59.472 --> 00:10:03.395
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Can I take it back?

154
00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.779
You're not even friends with Shi Kyung.

155
00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:09.765
I invited you to his
birthday party all on my own.

156
00:10:09.765 --> 00:10:11.576
I think I was really crazy
at that moment.

157
00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:13.947
Could you just take it
as nonsense and forget about it?

158
00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.366
I don't want to. I'm going to go.

159
00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:17.885
You're going to go?

160
00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:20.635
Yes. I was invited, so I'm going.

161
00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:21.866
That's my answer.

162
00:10:32.858 --> 00:10:36.385
You wouldn't have to worry about
getting caught if it was a normal call.

163
00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:39.795
Soo Bin says she has to see
my face once a day.

164
00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:42.077
Otherwise, she can't study.
What else can I do?

165
00:10:43.577 --> 00:10:45.685
I miss my Soo Bin, too.

166
00:10:46.567 --> 00:10:49.225
She shouldn't be able to see
the hospital building from here.

167
00:10:49.225 --> 00:10:50.664
It should be okay.

168
00:10:50.664 --> 00:10:51.726
I think so too.

169
00:10:52.795 --> 00:10:55.592
How do I look?
I don't look sick, do I?

170
00:10:55.592 --> 00:10:57.225
You still look very healthy.

171
00:11:00.245 --> 00:11:04.295
How long are you going
to hide it from Soo Bin?

172
00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:06.694
Until my daughter is accepted
into college...

173
00:11:08.275 --> 00:11:12.428
Soo Bin would stop studying
if she knew I was terminally ill.

174
00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:15.116
She would come running
to act as my nurse.

175
00:11:16.126 --> 00:11:17.254
Yes, but what if...

176
00:11:17.254 --> 00:11:19.342
What if I die before then?

177
00:11:21.904 --> 00:11:22.914
Even still...

178
00:11:23.862 --> 00:11:25.842
I still need to hide it.

179
00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:27.745
I will be gone someday.

180
00:11:27.745 --> 00:11:30.843
I don't want Soo Bin to destroy
her life because of me.

181
00:11:32.783 --> 00:11:34.721
That's the way all mothers feel.

182
00:11:37.972 --> 00:11:39.822
- It's time to talk to Soo Bin.
- Okay.

183
00:11:39.822 --> 00:11:41.083
I'll be over here.

184
00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:49.092
- Daughter.
- <i>Mom!</i>

185
00:11:50.097 --> 00:11:51.726
How are you feeling today?

186
00:11:51.726 --> 00:11:53.247
<i>Very good.</i>

187
00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:55.471
Did you do well on your
social studies presentation?

188
00:11:55.471 --> 00:11:57.709
I did just as you coached me.

189
00:11:57.709 --> 00:12:00.756
I discussed the issue of comfort women
using law and politics.

190
00:12:00.756 --> 00:12:03.007
The reaction was totally great.

191
00:12:03.007 --> 00:12:05.223
That's great!

192
00:12:05.223 --> 00:12:08.414
What about the book?
Did you read it and write a report?

193
00:12:08.414 --> 00:12:11.513
I wrote it and mailed it to you.

194
00:12:11.513 --> 00:12:12.683
You haven't read it yet?

195
00:12:14.624 --> 00:12:15.853
You did?

196
00:12:18.847 --> 00:12:22.384
I'm out at a college entrance exam
information session, so I haven't yet.

197
00:12:22.384 --> 00:12:24.515
I'll read it later and review it.

198
00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:33.799
Are you looking for someone?

199
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.744
Yes. My mom.

200
00:12:36.744 --> 00:12:40.290
I wronged my mom yesterday,
so I wanted to cheer her up.

201
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.552
I saw your mom out in the yard
with the patient Song Kyung Ae.

202
00:12:43.552 --> 00:12:46.550
Really? I better go see my mom.

203
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.731
Oh, Bom. Do you want come too?

204
00:12:52.502 --> 00:12:54.862
You know you have the TEPS exam
this weekend, right?

205
00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:57.475
Try to score at least a 920.

206
00:12:57.475 --> 00:12:59.664
<i>That's why I'm going to study all night.</i>

207
00:13:02.154 --> 00:13:03.715
Mom, this is Bom.

208
00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:07.179
<i>Mom, is someone there?</i>

209
00:13:07.179 --> 00:13:08.750
Oh, uh...

210
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.151
Say hello. This is my mom.

211
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:11.250
Hello.

212
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.919
Oh.

213
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.500
<i>Mom, who are you with right now?</i>

214
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:26.901
Oh... well, uh...

215
00:13:26.901 --> 00:13:30.347
Soo Bin! Hi, I'm your mom's friend.

216
00:13:30.347 --> 00:13:31.779
<i>Hello.</i>

217
00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:35.850
I went to the information session with
your mom, and we're resting in a park.

218
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.770
<i>Information session? Park?</i>

219
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.140
<i>Why is my mom acting like that?</i>

220
00:13:41.322 --> 00:13:42.345
Oh!

221
00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:47.943
The person who just spoke is my son.

222
00:13:48.713 --> 00:13:51.583
Shi Kyung is a junior just like you.

223
00:13:51.583 --> 00:13:54.502
Hi, my name is Soo Bin.

224
00:13:54.502 --> 00:13:56.764
Park Soo Bin. How about you?

225
00:13:58.564 --> 00:14:01.779
Oh... I'm Lee Shi Kyung.

226
00:14:08.895 --> 00:14:11.016
Isn't that totally absurd?

227
00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:12.467
What?

228
00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:16.120
Soo Bin's mom is in the
late stages of breast cancer.

229
00:14:17.218 --> 00:14:21.029
It has spread to her liver,
so she doesn't have much time left.

230
00:14:21.029 --> 00:14:25.369
But, she's hiding the cancer
from her daughter.

231
00:14:25.369 --> 00:14:27.399
Does that make sense?

232
00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:28.568
I understand it.

233
00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:30.047
You understand?

234
00:14:30.047 --> 00:14:34.236
Yes, I think I can understand
how Soo Bin's mom feels.

235
00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:37.490
Then what about Soo Bin?
What about her?

236
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.369
What happens once she finds out
after her mother dies?

237
00:14:40.369 --> 00:14:41.888
She'll go totally crazy.

238
00:14:41.888 --> 00:14:43.799
She will, at first.

239
00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:47.259
Wouldn't Soo Bin eventually
understand her mother's sincerity?

240
00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:48.750
<i>Sincerity?</i>

241
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.257
<i>You understand if it's sincere?</i>

242
00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:52.611
Shi Kyung.

243
00:14:54.888 --> 00:14:56.318
Hello, Grandma.

244
00:14:56.318 --> 00:14:59.970
Oh, it's my Shi Kyung's girlfriend.

245
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.257
You know that we're dating too?

246
00:15:02.257 --> 00:15:06.672
The whole town knows that you two are
a "gouple" or "couple," whatever it is.

247
00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:09.064
You're practically married.

248
00:15:09.064 --> 00:15:10.414
That's not good.

249
00:15:11.875 --> 00:15:14.606
You have a good one with our Shi Kyung.

250
00:15:14.606 --> 00:15:16.596
Grandma, you're the best.

251
00:15:17.174 --> 00:15:19.350
Grandma, I'll take that.
I'll carry it for you.

252
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.616
- Please put it in the director's office.
- All right.

253
00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:29.933
Grandma, Bom said
she met you in the past.

254
00:15:29.933 --> 00:15:30.948
Me?

255
00:15:32.592 --> 00:15:34.722
I don't remember that.

256
00:15:38.414 --> 00:15:40.322
I was so nervous I was sweating.

257
00:15:40.322 --> 00:15:42.463
Thanks to you, we got through it.

258
00:15:43.163 --> 00:15:45.121
Sorry about my Shi Kyung.

259
00:15:46.715 --> 00:15:47.852
Be careful.

260
00:15:52.573 --> 00:15:55.476
Shi Kyung must have a girlfriend.

261
00:15:55.476 --> 00:15:57.891
Yes, I recently found out myself.

262
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:02.773
It will be hard to study
if he already has a girlfriend.

263
00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:06.486
You're going to have big trouble,
Shi Kyung's mom.

264
00:16:06.486 --> 00:16:08.303
You are simpler than I thought.

265
00:16:09.292 --> 00:16:12.302
I don't know how much time you have left.

266
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.783
Learn from what I'm doing if you
want to send Shi Kyung to college.

267
00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:25.385
This one too?

268
00:16:25.385 --> 00:16:26.510
Why are there so many?

269
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.581
Is there something to eat?

270
00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:29.106
There are some yams in there.

271
00:16:33.028 --> 00:16:34.560
Hey, Shi Kyung.

272
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.876
How many assessments
have you done so far?

273
00:16:36.876 --> 00:16:37.976
How many have I done?

274
00:16:39.036 --> 00:16:42.350
Uh, the tombstone inscription...

275
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.826
The tombstone inscription...

276
00:16:44.826 --> 00:16:47.809
You can't even remember what you've done?

277
00:16:47.809 --> 00:16:49.086
Why do I have to remember?

278
00:16:50.396 --> 00:16:52.185
Forget I said anything.

279
00:16:52.185 --> 00:16:53.396
Why are you suddenly asking?

280
00:16:55.074 --> 00:16:57.009
Soo Bin's mom told me...

281
00:16:57.009 --> 00:17:00.324
that your personal profile is important
if you want to get into college.

282
00:17:00.324 --> 00:17:02.476
All these extra assessments
are part of your profile.

283
00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:06.136
<i>Mom has become strange
ever since she met Soo Bin's mom.</i>

284
00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:09.356
You've been reading
your books, haven't you?

285
00:17:10.215 --> 00:17:12.806
<i>In a very negative way, at that.</i>

286
00:17:15.156 --> 00:17:17.215
<i>Then, there's my friend, Ga Ram...</i>

287
00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:21.596
<i>He is regressing in a very positive way.</i>

288
00:17:23.507 --> 00:17:27.344
<i>Ga Ram, I'm sorry for being your friend.</i>

289
00:17:28.555 --> 00:17:29.575
Eat up.

290
00:17:36.065 --> 00:17:38.094
What is Bom giving you for your birthday?

291
00:17:38.094 --> 00:17:39.127
Oh yeah.

292
00:17:42.207 --> 00:17:43.716
Welcome.

293
00:17:43.716 --> 00:17:45.425
What can I help you with?

294
00:17:48.775 --> 00:17:51.647
<i>Kim Bom, I thought about it.</i>

295
00:17:51.647 --> 00:17:55.048
<i>The birthday present I want from you
is for you to come over to my house.</i>

296
00:17:55.048 --> 00:17:56.168
<i>That's more than enough.</i>

297
00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:04.448
<i>Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.</i>

298
00:18:04.448 --> 00:18:08.650
<i>Happy birthday, dear Shi Kyung.
Happy birthday to you.</i>

299
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.200
Woo!

300
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.400
Thank you.

301
00:18:12.101 --> 00:18:13.515
- Can I blow them out?
- Yes.

302
00:18:13.515 --> 00:18:14.515
All right.

303
00:18:22.582 --> 00:18:25.001
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

304
00:18:25.001 --> 00:18:26.454
Today's highlight!

305
00:18:26.454 --> 00:18:28.095
Next...

306
00:18:28.095 --> 00:18:31.538
Grandma Kim Duk Boon will now sing
a celebratory song for her grandson!

307
00:18:31.538 --> 00:18:34.207
We will now have a rap concert!

308
00:18:34.207 --> 00:18:35.695
Yeah!

309
00:18:35.695 --> 00:18:36.992
Grandma, rap.

310
00:18:36.992 --> 00:18:41.033
- Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!
- Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!

311
00:18:41.033 --> 00:18:43.073
What is this?

312
00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:48.277
Here you go.

313
00:18:48.277 --> 00:18:51.246
- Grandma, Grandma!
- Grandma, Grandma!

314
00:18:52.315 --> 00:18:55.207
<i>What are you saying
in those nonsense words?</i>

315
00:18:55.207 --> 00:18:57.997
<i>How could I be controlled by
my granddaughter at the age of 70?</i>

316
00:18:57.997 --> 00:19:00.136
<i>Look at this room. Look at your clothes.</i>

317
00:19:00.136 --> 00:19:03.772
<i>If you put a flower in your hair,
you're a crazy woman.</i>

318
00:19:03.772 --> 00:19:06.598
<i>- Grandma does not know.
- What don't I know?</i>

319
00:19:06.598 --> 00:19:09.275
<i>- She does not know a thing.
- Why wouldn't I know?</i>

320
00:19:09.275 --> 00:19:12.144
<i>- She doesn't know age 17.
- Why wouldn't I know?</i>

321
00:19:12.144 --> 00:19:13.843
<i>She does not know a thing.</i>

322
00:19:13.843 --> 00:19:15.901
Why are there so many requirements?

323
00:19:24.083 --> 00:19:25.243
Yes, Soo Bin's mom.

324
00:19:26.912 --> 00:19:28.033
What did you say?

325
00:19:30.342 --> 00:19:31.838
007 bang!

326
00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.188
007 bang.

327
00:19:35.671 --> 00:19:37.684
Wait, wait! I'll be her black knight.

328
00:19:37.684 --> 00:19:40.416
Oh! So annoying.

329
00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:43.498
That's not fair.

330
00:19:43.498 --> 00:19:46.294
It was you, right? Was it you?
Who punched me?

331
00:19:46.294 --> 00:19:48.084
Next round. Come on.

332
00:19:48.525 --> 00:19:49.762
007 bang!

333
00:19:57.556 --> 00:19:59.905
- Soo Bin's mom.
- Shi Kyung's mom.

334
00:19:59.905 --> 00:20:02.564
What do you mean Soo Bin
is in the emergency room?

335
00:20:02.564 --> 00:20:06.666
Soo Bin has a very high fever,
and she's in the ER.

336
00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:08.935
Is the teacher with her?

337
00:20:08.935 --> 00:20:10.784
Well, yes but...

338
00:20:10.784 --> 00:20:14.178
Soo Bin keeps rambling
and looking for her mom.

339
00:20:24.031 --> 00:20:26.150
Shi Kyung, Shi Kyung.

340
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.638
Can you go outside?

341
00:20:27.638 --> 00:20:30.036
Outside, why? Is someone here?

342
00:20:30.036 --> 00:20:34.069
Oh... Eom Yong Gi.

343
00:20:34.069 --> 00:20:35.530
Eom Yong Gi?

344
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.994
I invited him.

345
00:20:36.994 --> 00:20:40.107
- Aunt!
- It just worked out that way.

346
00:20:40.107 --> 00:20:42.800
What can I do?

347
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.303
Go on inside. I'll take care of it.

348
00:21:00.588 --> 00:21:02.225
I heard my aunt invited you.

349
00:21:02.998 --> 00:21:05.550
You can come in since you're here.

350
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.530
Are you insane? You think I would go
to a birthday party like a kid?

351
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.969
Then why are you here?

352
00:21:11.514 --> 00:21:12.561
This.

353
00:21:17.217 --> 00:21:21.237
This is what you were searching for
like crazy in the woods, right?

354
00:21:22.317 --> 00:21:23.907
Why do you have this?

355
00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:25.336
Because I found it there.

356
00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.846
<i>This was in the woods.</i>

357
00:21:31.477 --> 00:21:33.408
Is it real though?

358
00:21:34.476 --> 00:21:35.546
It's fake, right?

359
00:21:41.906 --> 00:21:43.811
007... bang!

360
00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:46.290
Hey, get over here.

361
00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.242
Indian rice!

362
00:21:49.317 --> 00:21:51.342
007 bang!

363
00:21:51.342 --> 00:21:53.175
Get over here.

364
00:21:53.175 --> 00:21:57.484
Indian rice!

365
00:21:59.025 --> 00:22:00.669
Who did that?

366
00:22:09.798 --> 00:22:11.083
Do you want something to drink?

367
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.301
No, I was just looking for Shi Kyung.

368
00:22:14.301 --> 00:22:17.494
He's probably in the bathroom.
Shi Kyung ate tons of food.

369
00:22:26.649 --> 00:22:29.314
You seem to get along well with everyone.

370
00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:32.640
I thought you wouldn't want to play
007 Bang because it's childish.

371
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.389
The game is a bit childish,
but it's fun playing with everyone.

372
00:22:36.389 --> 00:22:40.792
This is my first time
being part of a birthday party.

373
00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:42.255
Really?

374
00:22:42.255 --> 00:22:43.717
What do you do on your birthday?

375
00:22:43.717 --> 00:22:46.509
I buy a cake and light
a candle for myself.

376
00:22:46.509 --> 00:22:48.383
I play by myself.

377
00:22:48.383 --> 00:22:52.409
Now, I understand why you let
yourself go to have some fun.

378
00:22:52.409 --> 00:22:54.544
Let's go back in.
We should play more games.

379
00:22:54.544 --> 00:22:57.684
Later. I want a tour of the house.

380
00:22:57.684 --> 00:22:59.425
Okay, then.

381
00:22:59.425 --> 00:23:01.448
The front yard is the best part
of this house.

382
00:23:01.448 --> 00:23:04.026
The best part of it is
Grandma's clay jar stand.

383
00:23:04.026 --> 00:23:05.084
Take a look.

385
00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:53.868
I told you not to call me.

386
00:23:53.868 --> 00:23:57.219
How many times do I have to say it?
I'm not doing the dating service anymore.

387
00:23:57.803 --> 00:24:00.398
Fine. Let's meet up and talk.

388
00:24:00.398 --> 00:24:03.247
I'll meet you where you
dropped me off in an hour.

389
00:24:10.324 --> 00:24:13.496
<i>It's not a modeling agency,
but a dating service?</i>

390
00:24:28.286 --> 00:24:32.589
<i>Then, the girl in the
sports car was Kim Bom?</i>

391
00:24:34.205 --> 00:24:37.947
I wanted to see you
because I like you, Min Ji.

392
00:24:37.947 --> 00:24:39.588
Why are you being so difficult?

393
00:24:39.588 --> 00:24:41.769
I have no interest in you.

394
00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:43.777
I don't want to date you.

395
00:24:43.777 --> 00:24:45.358
You need money, don't you?

396
00:24:45.358 --> 00:24:46.738
I'll give you everything.

397
00:24:46.738 --> 00:24:50.342
I'll buy you everything you need.
You still don't like me?

398
00:24:50.342 --> 00:24:52.152
How many times do I have to tell you?

399
00:24:52.152 --> 00:24:54.417
If you keep this up,
I'm going to call my boyfriend.

400
00:24:54.417 --> 00:24:55.822
Boyfriend?

401
00:24:55.822 --> 00:24:57.850
Who? Him?

402
00:24:59.777 --> 00:25:00.821
Lee Shi Kyung!

403
00:25:03.278 --> 00:25:06.509
<i>Is this how it feels
to fall into a blackhole?</i>

404
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.599
It looks like your boyfriend
is a high school student too.

405
00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.447
Min Ji.

406
00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:18.245
<i>The whole world is
suddenly dark and spinning.</i>

407
00:25:18.245 --> 00:25:19.775
Just come to me.

408
00:25:19.775 --> 00:25:22.485
I'll be waiting for your call, Min Ji.

409
00:25:33.419 --> 00:25:34.428
Shi Kyung.

410
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:36.721
What was real?

411
00:25:38.392 --> 00:25:42.340
Out of all the things you have
told me... which ones were real?

412
00:25:56.704 --> 00:25:58.931
Yong Gi found this ring in the grass.

413
00:26:00.996 --> 00:26:02.607
You told me you found it.

414
00:26:03.627 --> 00:26:08.368
You said that the guy who just left
is the president of a modeling agency.

415
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.564
Yeah.

416
00:26:14.564 --> 00:26:16.642
- It was all a lie.
- Yes, but why!

417
00:26:17.941 --> 00:26:20.392
Why did you lie to me?

418
00:26:20.392 --> 00:26:23.617
- Why?
- I wanted to do something for you too!

419
00:26:25.845 --> 00:26:28.563
I tried to buy the same ring.

420
00:26:28.563 --> 00:26:29.842
It was too expensive.

421
00:26:29.842 --> 00:26:32.303
So, I felt I had no choice
but to work a job that paid a lot.

422
00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:41.953
Lee Shi Kyung, I did it
because I like you so much.

423
00:26:43.132 --> 00:26:44.604
<i>Because you like someone.</i>

424
00:26:49.322 --> 00:26:50.957
Whose cactus is that?

425
00:26:52.383 --> 00:26:53.697
Lee Shi Kyung's.

426
00:26:54.786 --> 00:26:58.887
Once Shi Kyung finds out the truth,
he'll be very disappointed.

427
00:26:58.887 --> 00:27:00.846
I'm still going to continue to do it.

428
00:27:00.846 --> 00:27:04.287
I want to see how this cactus
helps Lee Shi Kyung grow.

429
00:27:04.287 --> 00:27:05.900
I'm curious.

430
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.290
<i>[Lee Shi Kyung]
For the sake of someone's future...</i>

432
00:27:11.564 --> 00:27:13.368

00:27:13.368 --> 00:27:14.383
Thanks.

434
00:27:15.982 --> 00:27:17.019
Soo Bin.

435
00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:19.159
Mom. Where's my mom?

436
00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:23.832
Your mom? She was rushing to see you
and sprained her ankle.

437
00:27:23.832 --> 00:27:25.592
That's why I'm here instead.

438
00:27:27.228 --> 00:27:28.887
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

439
00:27:30.928 --> 00:27:33.012
<i>If you truly care for someone...</i>

440
00:27:34.002 --> 00:27:35.961
<i>you can even lie to that person.</i>

441
00:27:36.891 --> 00:27:38.546
I wanted to see my mom.

442
00:27:38.546 --> 00:27:40.255
<i>I felt like I understood that a little.</i>

443

It's your birthday present.

444
00:28:01.662 --> 00:28:06.133
I was going to give you this ring today
and tell you the truth.

445
00:28:09.809 --> 00:28:11.109
It's too late now.

446

449
00:29:09.816 --> 00:29:13.601
<i>What is this feeling that keeps
my feet planted to the ground?</i>

450
00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:37.296
What is that?

451
00:29:39.851 --> 00:29:42.630
<i>[What’s the one human trait

That's the topic for the ethics test
at the end of the term.

453
00:29:44.928 --> 00:29:47.912
- Oh no!
- I hate it.

454
00:29:47.912 --> 00:29:49.323
What is that?

00:29:49.323 --> 00:29:52.323
I know it's too hard for you.
But, just try it.

<i>- That's how I feel now.</i>
- You will present in groups.

Yes, his profile and grades

483
00:31:32.072 --> 00:31:35.321
How? As kids these days would say...

484
00:31:35.321 --> 00:31:39.553
How could you be such losers?

485
00:31:39.553 --> 00:31:40.633
To put it another way...

486
00:31:40.633 --> 00:31:42.255
Do you need this back now?

487
00:31:43.245 --> 00:31:45.922
- What?
- Can I look at it and return it?

488
00:31:45.922 --> 00:31:47.684
I want to look at it in detail.

489
00:31:51.082 --> 00:31:53.834
Okay. Look at it quickly,
and put it on my desk.

490
00:31:53.834 --> 00:31:56.707
Also, come back after school.

491
00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.284
We're going to have a consultation.

492
00:32:05.848 --> 00:32:07.688
Hey, I'm not done yet.

493
00:32:08.848 --> 00:32:10.070
Are you memorizing it?

494
00:32:15.709 --> 00:32:16.929
Can I look first?

495
00:32:20.063 --> 00:32:21.128
See you later.

496
00:32:46.295 --> 00:32:47.938
It's pretty.

497
00:32:47.938 --> 00:32:50.406
How can the colors be so vibrant?

498
00:32:51.637 --> 00:32:55.755
The green background
makes the flowers stand out.

499
00:33:00.305 --> 00:33:01.409
I like it.

500
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.236
I like it all.

501
00:33:03.979 --> 00:33:07.457
Music, art, sunlight.

502
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:11.811
A cup of coffee would make this perfect.

503
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:17.028
I'd do anything for a cup of
hand-drip Ethiopia Aricha from my cafe.

504
00:33:19.134 --> 00:33:21.976
I like Guatemala Antigua.

505
00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:28.130
You didn't know I was from Seoul and
owned a cafe that closed down, right?

506
00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:30.383
I know how to prepare hand-drip coffee.

507
00:33:30.971 --> 00:33:32.430
Really?

508
00:33:33.591 --> 00:33:36.253
I would have loved
to have gone to your cafe.

509
00:33:36.253 --> 00:33:38.460
I'll get some Aricha
for you and make it.

510
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.714
You can enjoy the fragrance.

511
00:33:42.561 --> 00:33:44.387
You're lucky.

512
00:33:44.387 --> 00:33:47.147
This music and art...

513
00:33:47.971 --> 00:33:50.857
This sunlight and coffee.

514
00:33:52.384 --> 00:33:54.313
Seeing the kids grow up.

515
00:33:55.742 --> 00:33:58.262
You can enjoy all of that.

516
00:34:00.581 --> 00:34:02.698
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

517
00:34:03.976 --> 00:34:06.022
The person who lives for today
is the winner.

518
00:34:08.355 --> 00:34:09.373
You think so?

519
00:34:13.214 --> 00:34:14.883
Anyway, I like it.

520
00:34:16.825 --> 00:34:18.639
I like it too.

521
00:34:40.914 --> 00:34:42.503
What did you just say?

522
00:34:42.503 --> 00:34:45.648
<i>I beat Jin Hyuk
on the test this time.</i>

523
00:34:45.648 --> 00:34:49.369
How did you do that? I thought
Jin Hyuk was impossible to beat.

524
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:51.032
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

525
00:34:51.032 --> 00:34:54.101
<i>But, Jin Hyuk has a girlfriend now, Mom.</i>

526
00:34:54.101 --> 00:34:58.052
Oh my! That's why he's not studying.

527
00:34:58.052 --> 00:34:59.336
What's he going to do?

528
00:34:59.336 --> 00:35:01.505
<i>It's not that he isn't.</i>

529
00:35:01.505 --> 00:35:02.561
<i>I don't know.</i>

530
00:35:02.561 --> 00:35:05.715
<i>I beat Jin Hyuk for the first time.
Can you believe it?</i>

531
00:35:06.919 --> 00:35:09.072
You're the best, Soo Bin!

532
00:35:09.072 --> 00:35:11.874
<i>Mom, I'm going to go out
with my friends this weekend.</i>

533
00:35:11.874 --> 00:35:13.361
- All right.
- <i>Wait, no.</i>

534
00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:15.472
<i>First, I want to eat your home cooking.</i>

535
00:35:15.472 --> 00:35:17.376
<i>I really miss your cooking, Mom.</i>

536
00:35:17.376 --> 00:35:20.546
<i>Ah, Mom. Is your foot better?</i>

537
00:35:20.546 --> 00:35:22.401
<i>You're well enough to drive, right?</i>

538
00:35:22.401 --> 00:35:25.622
Yes, I'm all better.

539
00:35:25.622 --> 00:35:27.171
I'll cook for you.

540
00:35:29.342 --> 00:35:32.374
Really? Shi Young
really gave this to you?

541
00:35:33.082 --> 00:35:34.673
She wouldn't do that.

542
00:35:35.932 --> 00:35:40.570
Lee Shi Young isn't the type of person
to give something like this away.

543
00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.592
I guess she thought my bike broke
because of her.

544
00:35:43.592 --> 00:35:45.577
Besides, she won this as a prize.

545
00:35:45.577 --> 00:35:49.336
Even so, Shi Young is the type
to want her cut of the prize.

546
00:35:50.296 --> 00:35:52.296
I think you're very wrong about her.

547
00:35:52.296 --> 00:35:54.260
Am I?

548
00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.503
Shi Young giving away a free bike?

549
00:35:58.084 --> 00:35:59.985
She would never do that.

550
00:35:59.985 --> 00:36:02.977
You must not know
Lee Shi Young very well yet.

551
00:36:02.977 --> 00:36:05.996
She would never do anything
that would cause her to suffer a loss.

552
00:36:05.996 --> 00:36:08.541
She is inhumane and revolting.

553
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.965
You just want to hit her
whenever you see her.

554
00:36:10.965 --> 00:36:12.436
So detestable.

555
00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:26.119
Hello. Yes, Grandma.

556
00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:30.175
Shi Young is here. Yes...

557
00:36:31.943 --> 00:36:33.226
I'll tell her.

558
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.034
How long have you been standing there?

559
00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:44.322
You're supposed to give Grandma
Korean lessons today.

560
00:36:45.793 --> 00:36:48.974
She said she's coming home early,
and you should come home early, too.

561
00:36:49.876 --> 00:36:53.907
- She said you weren't picking up.
- It's true that I gave him the bike.

562
00:36:55.767 --> 00:36:56.773
What?

563
00:37:07.063 --> 00:37:10.816
Lee Shi Young.
Hop on. I'll give you a ride.

564
00:37:10.816 --> 00:37:12.119
I'm not going home.

565
00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:14.492
Wherever you're going,
I'll take you.

566
00:37:14.492 --> 00:37:16.590
It's okay. I want to walk alone.

567
00:37:18.782 --> 00:37:22.675
If this is about the bike
that I gave you...

568
00:37:22.675 --> 00:37:24.570
It's not that.

569
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.820
You rode my bike as soon as you got here.

570
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.650
Use your designated driver,
Driver Park, often.

571
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.769
Okay.

572
00:37:33.769 --> 00:37:35.655
You can go on your own today, Driver.

573
00:37:35.655 --> 00:37:36.655
Next time.

574
00:37:42.747 --> 00:37:45.459
<i>[Where are you?
My mom invited you to dinner.]</i>

575
00:37:48.753 --> 00:37:50.713
<i>Grandma went out?</i>

576
00:37:50.713 --> 00:37:53.834
Yeah, she was waiting for Shi Young,
got angry, and left.

577
00:37:53.834 --> 00:37:55.775
- What happened to Shi Young?
- I don't know.

578
00:37:56.445 --> 00:37:58.825
I told her that Grandma would be waiting.

579
00:37:59.613 --> 00:38:00.722
Is that so?

580
00:38:01.543 --> 00:38:03.314
Let's eat for now.

581
00:38:04.526 --> 00:38:07.240
Ga Ram, enjoy your meal.

582
00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.240
If you feel up for it afterward,
study for the test with Shi Kyung.

583
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.568
- You can sleep over too.
- Okay.

584
00:38:12.568 --> 00:38:15.950
<i>So, that's why Mom invited
Ga Ram to come over.</i>

585
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:20.197
Jung Won, you have to be at a
similar level to study together.

586
00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:22.066
It would be a tutoring session
with these two.

587
00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:25.188
He would be tutoring him.

588
00:38:25.188 --> 00:38:27.938
Aunt Jung Soo is right.
You could pay Ga Ram a tutoring fee.

589
00:38:31.055 --> 00:38:33.508
Shi Young, have you had dinner?

590
00:38:34.669 --> 00:38:38.570
Hey, I told you Grandma would be waiting.

591
00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.385
How could you be so inconsiderate?

592
00:38:40.385 --> 00:38:43.541
Lee Shi Young, come sit down.

593
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:44.970
I don't feel like eating.

594
00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.191
Where have you been?
You broke your promise to Grandma, too.

595
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:50.700
Are you working during the exam period?

596
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.684
Are you determined not to study
in this town, too?

597
00:38:55.526 --> 00:38:57.490
Yes. I'm not going to study.

598
00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:00.829
Also, I'm not going to take the exams.

599
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:03.439
What? What did you just say?

600
00:39:03.439 --> 00:39:05.508
I'm not taking the exams.

601
00:39:05.508 --> 00:39:09.704
Also... I'm quitting school.

602
00:39:13.198 --> 00:39:14.807
What?

603
00:39:14.807 --> 00:39:17.486
<i>That... that human ticking time bomb.</i>

604
00:39:17.486 --> 00:39:18.736
<i>She has exploded again.</i>

605
00:39:27.834 --> 00:39:30.664
<i>Your words are unconvincing.</i>

606
00:39:30.664 --> 00:39:35.912
If you had never studied at all
like Shi Kyung, then I would understand.

607
00:39:35.912 --> 00:39:39.633
<i>Mom tricked me into thinking I was smart.
Never studied at all?</i>

608
00:39:39.633 --> 00:39:41.662
You were at the top
of your class in junior high.

609
00:39:41.662 --> 00:39:43.481
People said you were a genius.

610
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:46.760
That's all in the past.
I'm not that person anymore.

611
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:52.264
No. Being able to study that well
means that you're a natural at it.

612
00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:54.999
No, I have no interest in studying.

613
00:39:54.999 --> 00:39:57.590
There's no clear reason for me to study.

614
00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.481
Isn't this just your selfishness?

615
00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:02.660
Still, how can you quit school?

616
00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.691
What will you do if you quit?
What's your plan?

617
00:40:04.691 --> 00:40:07.840
I'll make money and think about
what I want to do.

618
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.820
It's better than going to school
when I'm not even studying.

619
00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.650
Is school a place only for studying?
That's not true.

620
00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:16.251
You just said I should keep going
because I'm good at studying.

621
00:40:16.251 --> 00:40:19.131
You are always contradicting yourself.
Do you know that?

622
00:40:19.131 --> 00:40:20.490
Are you serious?

623
00:40:24.735 --> 00:40:26.874
Why is it so noisy in here?

624
00:40:34.722 --> 00:40:37.881
It's not like I'm asking for a lot.

625
00:40:37.881 --> 00:40:39.651
What was that during a meal?

626
00:40:41.061 --> 00:40:43.381
- I liked it.
- What?

627
00:40:43.381 --> 00:40:45.680
It feels like a house
where people actually live.

628
00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.231
My house is just two guys,
and it feels totally lonely.

629
00:40:48.231 --> 00:40:50.332
I told you to take Lee Shi Young.

630
00:40:50.332 --> 00:40:52.211
Our house is quiet without her.

631
00:40:52.211 --> 00:40:53.371
Gosh, you.

632
00:40:54.731 --> 00:40:57.231
- Where are you going?
- Should I give you a ride?

633
00:40:57.231 --> 00:40:59.220
I'm going to take a bus out and walk.

634
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:05.030
You don't seem troubled over Shi Young.

635
00:41:06.001 --> 00:41:07.831
Is something going on with Bom?

636
00:41:07.831 --> 00:41:10.999
It's not like something's
going on or not.

637
00:41:10.999 --> 00:41:12.651
I don't really know.

638
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.351
Sorry.

639
00:41:15.351 --> 00:41:18.229
I want to help, but I'm not
so knowledgeable in this area.

640
00:41:18.229 --> 00:41:20.753
Don't they teach this in school?

641
00:41:20.753 --> 00:41:23.751
My feelings for my girlfriend are
complicated, so I don't know what to do.

642
00:41:23.751 --> 00:41:26.811
Complicated how?

643
00:41:26.811 --> 00:41:28.410
You wouldn't understand if I told you.

644
00:41:29.401 --> 00:41:32.530
You've only been with kids who are
like family, so how would you know?

645
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.300
That's true.

646
00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.858
See you at school tomorrow.

647
00:41:35.858 --> 00:41:36.878
Bye.

648
00:41:41.778 --> 00:41:42.968
<i>I miss her.</i>

649
00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:49.088
<i>But, I'm afraid of running into her.</i>

650
00:41:49.088 --> 00:41:50.787
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

651
00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:57.217
<i>Games are not even fun.</i>

652
00:41:58.793 --> 00:42:00.003
<i>How could this be?</i>

653
00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.849
<i>I can't go?</i>

654
00:42:49.249 --> 00:42:53.550
I'll only go for this one weekend.

655
00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.191
What did the doctor say?

656
00:42:55.191 --> 00:42:57.970
He's away at a seminar.

657
00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.615
When is he back?

658
00:42:59.615 --> 00:43:01.639
Please ask him for me.

659
00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.918
It's well-known that a trip
out is very dangerous.

660
00:43:09.157 --> 00:43:10.639
What if I go with her?

661
00:43:12.559 --> 00:43:13.782
Shi Kyung's mom.

662
00:43:13.782 --> 00:43:16.329
I'll go with her. I'll pack the medicine.

663
00:43:16.329 --> 00:43:17.805
If case something happens...

664
00:43:17.805 --> 00:43:20.137
And what if something happens?

665
00:43:20.137 --> 00:43:22.215
Would you be able
to take responsibility for it?

666
00:43:23.231 --> 00:43:26.012
- Well...
- I don't have the confidence to.

667
00:43:26.012 --> 00:43:31.043
I can't be responsible for what might
happen to a patient I allow out.

668
00:43:31.043 --> 00:43:32.331
That's why it's a no.

669
00:43:35.322 --> 00:43:36.907
Gosh, that woman.

670
00:43:36.907 --> 00:43:38.776
She wouldn't bleed if you pricked her.

671
00:43:40.767 --> 00:43:42.807
I can understand her.

672
00:43:43.597 --> 00:43:46.416
It would be a lot of trouble
if something happened to a patient.

673
00:43:48.838 --> 00:43:50.648
What should I do?

674
00:43:50.648 --> 00:43:54.246
I wanted to cook for Soo Bin
one last time.

675
00:43:57.197 --> 00:43:58.378
What do I do?

676
00:43:59.697 --> 00:44:03.537
My Soo Bin wants to eat her mom's food.

677
00:44:03.537 --> 00:44:05.896
She won't be able
to eat it in the future.

678
00:44:10.548 --> 00:44:12.438
Doctor Lee's phone number?

679
00:44:14.807 --> 00:44:16.577
What is this about?

680
00:44:16.577 --> 00:44:20.619
Are patients here
ever allowed a trip out?

681
00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:23.358
That would depend upon the patient.

682
00:44:23.358 --> 00:44:26.829
Ah, the chief nurse said no.

683
00:44:27.445 --> 00:44:28.822
How did you know?

684
00:44:28.822 --> 00:44:32.606
Doctor Lee and the chief nurse
often disagree on that.

685
00:44:32.606 --> 00:44:34.718
Doctor Lee wants to give them trips out.

686
00:44:34.718 --> 00:44:37.178
The chief nurse says no.

687
00:44:38.977 --> 00:44:40.207
Who is correct?

688
00:44:41.189 --> 00:44:43.818
They just approach things differently.

689
00:44:45.617 --> 00:44:49.798
I will give you Doctor Lee's number,
but don't tell anyone I gave it to you.

690
00:44:49.798 --> 00:44:52.119
I'm scared of the chief nurse.

691
00:44:53.463 --> 00:44:54.735
All right.

692
00:45:04.256 --> 00:45:07.885
You've never seen this neighborhood other
than the school and the hospice, right?

693
00:45:14.256 --> 00:45:15.285
Get on.

694
00:45:20.849 --> 00:45:21.880
Hold on tight.

695
00:45:48.521 --> 00:45:49.595
It's a chicken.

696
00:45:49.595 --> 00:45:51.124
Oh, that scared me.

697
00:45:56.742 --> 00:45:59.070
This land belongs to Ji Hoon's family.

698
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.303
You know that small guy with the glasses.

699
00:46:17.561 --> 00:46:19.619
You're good at these
discussions, Min Suk.

700
00:46:19.619 --> 00:46:21.077
You should lay down the basics.

701
00:46:21.477 --> 00:46:24.106
Isn't it better if each person
gives his input?

702
00:46:24.106 --> 00:46:27.986
No, no. You never know what he'll say.

703
00:46:29.246 --> 00:46:30.456
I'll keep my mouth full.

704
00:46:30.456 --> 00:46:31.996
Who's in Ga Ram's group?

705
00:46:31.996 --> 00:46:33.646
Ga Ram's the best at these discussions.

706
00:46:33.646 --> 00:46:34.910
You're so right.

707
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:36.811
Lee Shi Kyung, aren't you going home?

708
00:46:36.811 --> 00:46:39.311
I'm going to go.
I'm on clean-up duty today.

709
00:46:39.311 --> 00:46:42.642
You, Ga Ram, Bom, Yong Gi, and Shi Young.

710
00:46:42.642 --> 00:46:44.881
You're in the same group
for the ethics project, okay?

711
00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:47.014
No, this is the first I'm hearing of it.

712
00:46:47.014 --> 00:46:49.240
I told Bom already.

713
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.601
Guess she didn't tell you.

714
00:46:50.601 --> 00:46:54.610
I saw Bom this morning,
but I haven't seen her all day.

715
00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:56.332
I haven't seen Bom, either.

716
00:46:56.332 --> 00:46:59.014
You were with Bom in town yesterday.

717
00:47:02.122 --> 00:47:04.202
- What do you mean?
- Huh?

718
00:47:04.202 --> 00:47:05.503
I saw you.

719
00:47:05.503 --> 00:47:07.086
You saw me and Bom?

720
00:47:07.086 --> 00:47:09.968
Yes, you were in front of Bom.

721
00:47:09.968 --> 00:47:11.977
Bom was standing for a long time,
staring at you.

722
00:47:12.941 --> 00:47:14.901
- Where?
- Where was that?

723
00:47:15.802 --> 00:47:20.291
I thought you two were saying "bye bye,"
and Bom was sad to see you go.

724
00:47:20.291 --> 00:47:22.639
I was so envious.

725
00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:24.262
Wasn't that it?

726
00:47:24.262 --> 00:47:26.505
<i>Bom was watching me?</i>

727
00:47:29.561 --> 00:47:32.300
You have to tell your group,
especially Yong Gi!

728
00:47:32.923 --> 00:47:35.160
<i>Okay, I should go see her.</i>

729
00:47:36.001 --> 00:47:38.193
<i>Go see her and tell her everything.</i>

730
00:48:27.816 --> 00:48:29.892
This is where you hang out?

731
00:48:29.892 --> 00:48:31.883
There's a library in the hospice?

732
00:48:31.883 --> 00:48:34.316
Yes, but not many people come in here.

733
00:48:34.316 --> 00:48:35.342
Why?

734
00:48:37.193 --> 00:48:39.954
It was built, but people
don't make much use of it.

735
00:48:39.954 --> 00:48:41.722
It's practically my private study room.

736
00:48:43.135 --> 00:48:44.646
You study here?

737
00:48:46.202 --> 00:48:47.267
Let's go.

738
00:48:56.485 --> 00:48:57.717
What are you looking at?

739
00:48:58.343 --> 00:49:01.294
It's for Grandma.
I'm teaching her how to read Korean.

740
00:49:04.986 --> 00:49:08.287
Are you really quitting school?

741
00:49:08.287 --> 00:49:09.838
For real?

742
00:49:09.838 --> 00:49:12.298
Why? Are you going
to try to stop me, too?

743
00:49:13.407 --> 00:49:15.077
No, that's not it.

744
00:49:17.468 --> 00:49:20.956
I saw my dad's profile and grades
from when he attended our school.

745
00:49:20.956 --> 00:49:22.711
Shi Kyung didn't tell you, right?

746
00:49:22.711 --> 00:49:24.778
No, I hadn't heard.

747
00:49:24.778 --> 00:49:27.601
It felt very weird to see that.

748
00:49:27.601 --> 00:49:31.090
It felt like I was meeting my dad.

749
00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.269
My dad was ranked first for three years.

750
00:49:35.269 --> 00:49:38.204
He had the same goal
for his future for three years.

751
00:49:38.204 --> 00:49:40.932
Doctor, doctor, doctor...

752
00:49:41.923 --> 00:49:43.999
Then, he really became a doctor.

753
00:49:46.474 --> 00:49:47.986
I was a little envious.

754
00:49:49.334 --> 00:49:52.189
He had a reason to study
and the talent for it.

755
00:49:53.923 --> 00:49:56.802
It made me wonder why
I was going to school at all.

756
00:49:56.802 --> 00:50:00.200
What would happen if only people
like your dad went to school?

757
00:50:01.485 --> 00:50:04.575
Ah... you're like him, too.

758
00:50:04.575 --> 00:50:07.200
- What?
- You have talent and a reason.

759
00:50:08.256 --> 00:50:11.323
Oh! You're going to medical school, too.

760
00:50:12.044 --> 00:50:15.012
You're just like my dad.

761
00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:16.535
You goody two-shoes.

762
00:50:16.535 --> 00:50:17.651
I don't think so.

763
00:50:19.602 --> 00:50:22.778
I ran away from home in junior high.

764
00:50:22.778 --> 00:50:24.048
With my bicycle chain?

765
00:50:24.048 --> 00:50:26.659
Bicycle chain? Why?

766
00:50:28.057 --> 00:50:30.818
Do you want to see where I ran away to?

767
00:50:34.997 --> 00:50:38.557
<i>Okay, I'll pretend to be crazy
and get help from my dad again.</i>

768
00:50:43.318 --> 00:50:47.827
Dad, you know what state I'm in
even if I don't tell you.

769
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.298
Give me a hint.

770
00:50:50.298 --> 00:50:52.869
I'll close my eyes, count to three,
and open my eyes.

771
00:50:52.869 --> 00:50:55.997
Then show me a hint
right in front of my eyes, okay?

772
00:50:55.997 --> 00:50:57.081
I'm doing it.

773
00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:01.916
One, two, three.

774
00:51:01.916 --> 00:51:03.485
Three.

775
00:51:03.485 --> 00:51:04.948
<i>[I knew if I stayed around long enough,
something like this would happen.]</i>

776
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.997
Dad! That isn't it.

777
00:51:08.997 --> 00:51:12.102
People are calling me Bernard
because I used that quote.

778
00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:13.436
Again?

779
00:51:15.126 --> 00:51:17.809
Yes, yes.

780
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:19.088
An enema?

781
00:51:20.778 --> 00:51:22.229
I've never administered one.

782
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.090
Yes, I'll have my mother-in-law teach me.

783
00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:30.720
Have you gone over the medication
with the chief nurse?

784
00:51:32.403 --> 00:51:34.155
Oh, that's a relief.

785
00:51:34.155 --> 00:51:37.974
I'll organize the medication,
and let you know if anything happens.

786
00:51:37.974 --> 00:51:39.463
Okay.

787
00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.227
Is this about taking that patient out?

788
00:51:41.227 --> 00:51:44.421
Yes.

789
00:51:44.421 --> 00:51:47.111
I'm worried.
It should be okay, right?

790
00:51:47.111 --> 00:51:48.693
Take Shi Kyung or Shi Young.

791
00:51:48.693 --> 00:51:51.845
You never know.
You might need more people.

792
00:51:51.845 --> 00:51:53.602
That sounds good.

793
00:51:53.602 --> 00:51:55.325
Do you have time?

794
00:51:55.325 --> 00:51:59.218
No, the student dean wants me
to submit a lot of things by Monday.

795
00:51:59.218 --> 00:52:01.102
I'll lend you the car.

796
00:52:01.102 --> 00:52:02.517
Who should I take?

797
00:52:02.517 --> 00:52:03.742
Shi Kyung, of course.

798
00:52:03.742 --> 00:52:06.189
Would Shi Young even go
after your fight earlier?

799
00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:08.309
You haven't made up, right?

800
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:09.856
Sh Young's not home yet, right?

801
00:52:09.856 --> 00:52:11.918
She here, teaching her grandma.

802
00:52:11.918 --> 00:52:14.217
She seems to be in a good mood.

803
00:52:14.217 --> 00:52:16.405
- That's unusual.
- How long will that last?

804
00:52:16.405 --> 00:52:18.135
One or two days.

805
00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:21.305
Good thing you're here.
You're not busy this Saturday, are you?

806
00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:23.084
I have exams soon.

807
00:52:23.084 --> 00:52:25.577
What do exams have to do with you?

808
00:52:25.577 --> 00:52:27.195
Help your mom.

809
00:52:27.195 --> 00:52:29.316
<i>Mom is so sharp these days.</i>

810
00:52:31.816 --> 00:52:33.316
Oh my! Already?

811
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:35.974
I have so much to do.

812
00:52:35.974 --> 00:52:38.128
I'll get in trouble
if I stay around like this.

813
00:52:40.874 --> 00:52:43.584
<i>Dad, did you plan this with Mom?</i>

814
00:52:44.847 --> 00:52:47.443
<i>Dad was persistent.</i>

815
00:52:55.055 --> 00:52:57.195
Why are you just standing there?

816
00:53:08.579 --> 00:53:10.206
<i>Dad!</i>

817
