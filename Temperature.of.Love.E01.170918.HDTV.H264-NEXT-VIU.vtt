3
00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:21.334
It's very easy to make stir-fried noodles with seafood...

4
00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:23.034
- Cut! - Cut!

5
00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:26.073
- My gosh. - What's wrong?

6
00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:27.144
Excuse me.

7
00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:28.743
- Move. - Please make way.

8
00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:31.013
That's not what you were supposed to say.

9
00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:32.343
That is what I was supposed to say.

10
00:01:32.343 --> 00:01:33.843
He's right. The script says, "It's very easy to make..."

11
00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:35.453
I told you to ignore the script.

12
00:01:35.653 --> 00:01:37.953
Remember what you said when we first met?

13
00:01:37.953 --> 00:01:39.754
I liked what you said back then. Let's use that.

14
00:01:39.754 --> 00:01:41.054
That's my personal opinion.

15
00:01:41.054 --> 00:01:43.123
And I'm saying that I like your personal opinion.

16
00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:44.493
I want the show to be real.

17
00:01:45.123 --> 00:01:46.664
I'm sure the writer doesn't know anything about what's real.

18
00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:48.894
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

19
00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:51.634
Okay, let's go. I want you to begin with stir-frying the noodles again.

20
00:01:52.564 --> 00:01:54.274
Let's start over from stir-frying the noodles.

21
00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:55.373
Okay.

22
00:01:56.373 --> 00:01:57.743
I'm this close to just leaving.

23
00:01:57.743 --> 00:01:59.774
I'm sorry. Let's just try shooting it one more time.

24
00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:01.274
Please show us enthusiastic reactions.

25
00:02:01.274 --> 00:02:02.513
- Let's do this. - My gosh.

26
00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:03.944
- Get ready. - Let's do this.

27
00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:06.644
Everybody, standby.

28
00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:24.763
To be honest, I don't really like cooking simple meals.

29
00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:26.034
But today...

30
00:02:26.034 --> 00:02:27.263
Stop shooting.

31
00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:29.404
Cut! Who was that?

32
00:02:29.404 --> 00:02:31.474
Stop shooting. This isn't based on my script.

33
00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:32.874
What's wrong with that lunatic?

34
00:02:32.874 --> 00:02:33.904
- Ms. Lee. - Stop shooting.

35
00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:36.444
You can't do this here. Please don't do this.

36
00:02:37.374 --> 00:02:38.613
Do you even think of me as a writer?

37
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.513
How can you do this to me?

38
00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:42.254
Do you even hear yourself?

39
00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:44.884
It's us who should be asking you that question.

40
00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:46.423
What are you doing right now?

41
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:47.994
Did you finish writing the next script?

42
00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:49.124
I didn't write it.

43
00:02:49.553 --> 00:02:51.793
What's the point? You don't even follow it.

44
00:02:52.793 --> 00:02:53.793
You drive me crazy.

45
00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:57.094
You're not Shakespeare. Can't we make edits?

46
00:02:57.263 --> 00:02:59.534
Writers shouldn't be bossing people around.

47
00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:01.004
I understand you might want to make edits,

48
00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:04.103
but you should at least tell me where you made them.

49
00:03:04.103 --> 00:03:07.004
If the beginning changes, so should the end. I need to know.

50
00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:11.113
You're irresponsible. You can't just shoot without thinking.

51
00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:12.583
You're the irresponsible one!

52
00:03:13.184 --> 00:03:15.914
Do you think acting like this is responsible?

53
00:03:15.914 --> 00:03:17.654
You left me with no choice!

54
00:03:19.884 --> 00:03:22.494
I'm exaggerating a bit, but I asked you 100 times.

55
00:03:22.694 --> 00:03:26.064
However, nothing changed. You pushed me to the edge.

56
00:03:26.224 --> 00:03:30.034
Gosh. This is why I never work with new writers. I must be crazy!

57
00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:31.303
No, I'm the one going crazy.

58
00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:35.173
I was greedy about making my debut that I ignored rumors about you.

59
00:03:35.474 --> 00:03:38.203
I knew you change people's writings, but I thought you wouldn't with me.

60
00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:41.714
It's thanks to my edits that you get 10 percent in viewership.

61
00:03:41.714 --> 00:03:44.414
We'd get 10 percent even if you left it the way it was.

62
00:03:45.543 --> 00:03:47.583
You're impossible to talk to.

63
00:03:49.513 --> 00:03:52.184
If you hate my work so much, you should stop shooting it.

64
00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:55.754
Are you telling me you'll fire me?

65
00:03:56.694 --> 00:03:59.994
How can I fire you? I really can't talk to you.

66
00:03:59.994 --> 00:04:01.634
Look who's talking.

67
00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:04.404
Okay, watch.

68
00:04:04.404 --> 00:04:07.103
There are over 100 staff and cast. Ask them.

69
00:04:07.103 --> 00:04:10.004
Do any of you think she's right? Even just one person?

70
00:04:13.474 --> 00:04:14.773
See? There's not a single person.

71
00:04:15.073 --> 00:04:17.713
I pity myself.

72
00:04:17.843 --> 00:04:21.184
I can't believe I have to work with an emotional teenager.

73
00:04:22.984 --> 00:04:24.184
Really?

74
00:04:28.023 --> 00:04:29.254
No one?

75
00:04:29.254 --> 00:04:30.754
Of course not. Why are you asking?

76
00:04:33.663 --> 00:04:34.734
Get out of here.

77
00:04:35.263 --> 00:04:36.963
Let us just work.

78
00:04:41.773 --> 00:04:42.874
All right.

79
00:04:43.203 --> 00:04:45.843
I'll take responsibility for my actions today.

80
00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:46.973
It's okay.

81
00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:51.044
You don't have to be responsible for what you did when you were drunk.

82
00:04:51.544 --> 00:04:52.614
Director.

83
00:04:53.044 --> 00:04:54.184
There's one.

84
00:05:00.823 --> 00:05:01.823
Me.

85
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:12.134
What are you doing?

86
00:05:13.604 --> 00:05:15.073
You're not our staff.

87
00:05:15.674 --> 00:05:16.874
I am today.

88
00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:27.884
I ran into him again.

89
00:05:29.213 --> 00:05:31.624
It had to be at a time when I'm behaving disgracefully.

90
00:05:34.323 --> 00:05:36.593
I never forgot about him for a second.

91
00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:40.364
I desperately...

92
00:05:41.393 --> 00:05:44.033
wanted to see him again even if by chance.

93
00:05:46.463 --> 00:05:47.463
My first love...

94
00:05:48.374 --> 00:05:51.073
that disappeared at the end of my youth...

95
00:05:52.174 --> 00:05:53.273
at the age of 29.

96
00:06:02.583 --> 00:06:07.223
(Temperature of Love)

97
00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:10.294
(5 years ago)

98
00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:15.934
(Episode 1)

99
00:06:16.064 --> 00:06:17.234
What did you just call me?

100
00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:19.463
- That hurts. - Don't pick a fight.

101
00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:20.804
Who do you think you're touching?

102
00:06:20.804 --> 00:06:21.874
Keep it down!

103
00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:23.634
Gosh.

104
00:06:24.403 --> 00:06:25.504
What are you looking at?

105
00:06:32.343 --> 00:06:33.413
That surprised me.

106
00:06:38.484 --> 00:06:39.924
(Being Thirty)

107
00:06:40.354 --> 00:06:41.424
(Writer Park Eun Sung)

108
00:06:42.223 --> 00:06:43.723
No!

109
00:06:45.124 --> 00:06:46.424
No, no.

110
00:06:47.564 --> 00:06:49.364
Detective Kim. Sir.

111
00:06:54.104 --> 00:06:55.104
What do you want?

112
00:06:55.304 --> 00:06:56.674
Can you undo the cuffs?

113
00:06:57.643 --> 00:07:00.604
Already? It hasn't even been half an hour.

114
00:07:00.804 --> 00:07:03.544
The writer called me. I have to know what happened.

115
00:07:03.544 --> 00:07:06.884
All the other assistants left last night. Why are you still here?

116
00:07:07.384 --> 00:07:09.754
You wanted to sleep here and have the cuffs on too.

117
00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:12.583
They are better writers than I am. I have to work twice as hard.

118
00:07:13.684 --> 00:07:15.194
I like that you're humble.

119
00:07:17.924 --> 00:07:18.994
- Hurry. - Let's see.

120
00:07:19.593 --> 00:07:20.994
Hurry, hurry.

121
00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:23.763
Is Hong Ah the main writer?

122
00:07:25.864 --> 00:07:27.263
(Hong Ah)

123
00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.703
(What is drama?)

124
00:07:30.304 --> 00:07:32.403
The number you're calling...

125
00:07:32.403 --> 00:07:34.143
(She never picks up her phone.)

126
00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:35.314
What is it?

127
00:07:36.013 --> 00:07:38.444
What took you so long? I called you three times.

128
00:07:38.444 --> 00:07:40.114
You're just impatient.

129
00:07:40.783 --> 00:07:42.684
I was trying to call you back when you called me again.

130
00:07:42.984 --> 00:07:44.723
If you're done, come here.

131
00:07:45.484 --> 00:07:46.554
Where are you?

132
00:07:46.783 --> 00:07:49.624
I told you. I'm in Kind Soup's restaurant in Hongdae.

133
00:07:49.994 --> 00:07:51.064
Kind Soup?

134
00:07:52.463 --> 00:07:53.823
Oh, the one with bad spellings?

135
00:07:54.434 --> 00:07:56.194
(Wi-Fi: Why are you still up? Kind Soup: I had team dinner todai.)

136
00:07:56.963 --> 00:07:58.004
What?

137
00:07:58.004 --> 00:07:59.064
(Kind Soup: I maid food.)

138
00:07:59.064 --> 00:08:00.333
(Emergency Doctor: I packed lunch for the nurses.)

139
00:08:00.663 --> 00:08:01.773
What's wrong with him?

140
00:08:02.674 --> 00:08:03.903
(Jane loves Wi-Fi)

141
00:08:03.903 --> 00:08:06.473
Yes. The one you hate for being stupid.

142
00:08:06.773 --> 00:08:09.073
I never said that I hate him. We've never met.

143
00:08:09.413 --> 00:08:11.884
I just don't like him. What does he do there anyway?

144
00:08:12.213 --> 00:08:14.314
I told you he cooks. How many times do I have to tell you?

145
00:08:14.513 --> 00:08:18.054
I can't remember something I'm not interested in.

146
00:08:18.153 --> 00:08:20.624
Anyway, let's eat here and chat...

147
00:08:20.624 --> 00:08:21.823
until our running club meet together.

148
00:08:22.093 --> 00:08:24.624
The writers want coffee. I have to go back to the office.

149
00:08:24.763 --> 00:08:27.263
Can't your boss buy her own coffee?

150
00:08:27.523 --> 00:08:28.593
The bus is here.

151
00:08:29.093 --> 00:08:30.833
Gosh, you're so modest.

152
00:08:30.934 --> 00:08:33.433
You act as if you won the writing contest already.

153
00:08:33.704 --> 00:08:36.004
I would be acting much worse if I won the contest.

154
00:08:38.173 --> 00:08:40.074
I'd dance in the middle of Yeouido.

155
00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:43.714
Haven't they called you yet? Aren't the results out?

156
00:08:44.074 --> 00:08:45.244
I didn't get a call yet.

157
00:08:47.714 --> 00:08:49.783
Do you know anyone that got the call?

158
00:08:50.454 --> 00:08:52.384
Not that I know of.

159
00:08:52.384 --> 00:08:53.824
Thank goodness.

160
00:08:55.393 --> 00:08:59.094
What if I don't make it again? I'm so worried.

161
00:08:59.563 --> 00:09:01.094
It's not like you to get so depressed.

162
00:09:01.594 --> 00:09:02.834
Just come out later.

163
00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.094
I'll have to see.

164
00:09:04.964 --> 00:09:06.263
I'll call you if I can't make it.

165
00:09:06.403 --> 00:09:09.004
You'll die from exhaustion if you keep that up.

166
00:09:09.074 --> 00:09:10.943
Why would an assistant work so hard?

167
00:09:10.943 --> 00:09:12.943
You have to work hard if you want to become anything.

168
00:09:14.204 --> 00:09:15.244
See you later then.

169
00:09:17.074 --> 00:09:18.714
What do you know about being a writer?

170
00:09:18.714 --> 00:09:20.183
I'm sure it's not any different.

171
00:09:20.183 --> 00:09:23.084
If you're here, just eat and go. Why did you want to see me?

172
00:09:23.283 --> 00:09:24.984
Because I have to talk to you.

173
00:09:25.324 --> 00:09:27.923
I wouldn't have come if you had a cellphone.

174
00:09:27.923 --> 00:09:30.254
Why don't you have a phone? It's the 21st century.

175
00:09:31.523 --> 00:09:33.193
Come to Gyeongbok Palace later.

176
00:09:33.193 --> 00:09:36.094
Can't you see I'm working? We're busy during the weekends.

177
00:09:36.094 --> 00:09:37.393
Just come after you're done.

178
00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:40.533
You've never met Hyun Soo. Right, you wouldn't know her name.

179
00:09:41.033 --> 00:09:43.933
Her user name is Jane. You've chatted with her before.

180
00:09:44.244 --> 00:09:45.244
I don't remember.

181
00:09:45.244 --> 00:09:47.374
I'll introduce you to her. She's a fun person to hang out.

182
00:09:48.074 --> 00:09:51.313
There is only one reason why I joined the running club.

183
00:09:51.943 --> 00:09:52.943
What's that?

184
00:09:53.614 --> 00:09:55.984
To run. I don't want to socialize.

185
00:09:56.413 --> 00:09:58.754
I made this garnish. Enjoy it and leave.

186
00:10:27.614 --> 00:10:28.653
Hey, hey.

187
00:10:29.614 --> 00:10:31.124
That's too thick.

188
00:10:31.124 --> 00:10:33.283
How many times do I have to tell you to cut them thin?

189
00:10:39.324 --> 00:10:42.334
Sir, could I go to the washroom?

190
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.433
Just do it in your pants.

191
00:10:44.163 --> 00:10:46.933
- Go, I'll do it. - Thank you.

192
00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:51.673
Why did you go into the hall?

193
00:10:52.204 --> 00:10:54.474
Did you want to show off your garnish to a girl?

194
00:10:54.813 --> 00:10:56.913
You think you got it good since you skipped...

195
00:10:56.913 --> 00:10:58.913
being an assistant after you studied in France, right?

196
00:11:00.344 --> 00:11:01.854
Why are you ignoring me?

197
00:11:02.513 --> 00:11:05.354
Was that a question? I thought you were talking to yourself.

198
00:11:06.283 --> 00:11:07.854
You little...

199
00:11:08.224 --> 00:11:11.163
You must think you're a big shot after becoming a section chef.

200
00:11:11.163 --> 00:11:12.393
Don't you know I'm your superior?

201
00:11:12.393 --> 00:11:15.293
Could you look after the steak? I have to prepare the garnish.

202
00:11:15.864 --> 00:11:18.163
Hey. Do you take me for a joke?

203
00:11:18.504 --> 00:11:19.903
I respect you, chef,

204
00:11:20.303 --> 00:11:22.433
but let's talk after the lunch servings are done.

205
00:11:22.533 --> 00:11:24.704
I'm sorry if I did anything to offend you.

206
00:11:25.574 --> 00:11:27.874
Hey, are you all right?

207
00:11:29.074 --> 00:11:30.643
I'm okay.

208
00:11:32.183 --> 00:11:33.244
Hey.

209
00:11:33.244 --> 00:11:35.754
I told you to call it when you're behind someone.

210
00:11:35.984 --> 00:11:38.484
Didn't I tell you how exposed we are to injuries?

211
00:11:40.183 --> 00:11:41.594
I'll make a quick trip to the hospital.

212
00:11:43.423 --> 00:11:46.224
Shall I call your mother for you, so that she doesn't worry about you?

213
00:11:46.893 --> 00:11:50.364
You must not know her very well. She's very strong.

214
00:11:50.594 --> 00:11:52.364
She'd throw away her kid to a dog.

215
00:11:56.673 --> 00:11:58.504
We have an announcement.

216
00:12:03.374 --> 00:12:05.084
I'll get right to the point.

217
00:12:05.084 --> 00:12:06.143
(On Jung Sun)

218
00:12:06.143 --> 00:12:07.484
Find him as soon as possible.

219
00:12:07.754 --> 00:12:09.084
I'll pay as much as you want.

220
00:12:10.013 --> 00:12:11.053
All right.

221
00:12:15.094 --> 00:12:16.693
Let's see how long you can hide.

222
00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:20.933
Goodness.

223
00:12:22.293 --> 00:12:23.293
Are you all right?

224
00:12:24.763 --> 00:12:25.834
Yes, I'm fine.

225
00:12:26.004 --> 00:12:27.004
Are you sure?

226
00:12:28.903 --> 00:12:30.033
I'm really sorry.

227
00:12:32.374 --> 00:12:33.474
Could you help me?

228
00:12:33.474 --> 00:12:34.513
Of course.

229
00:12:34.513 --> 00:12:37.913
Anything for a beautiful woman like you.

230
00:12:39.244 --> 00:12:40.283
Please follow me.

231
00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:42.854
You are very beautiful.

232
00:12:47.084 --> 00:12:49.224
What did you do while I was sleeping?

233
00:12:49.224 --> 00:12:50.293
These are all useless.

234
00:12:50.393 --> 00:12:51.663
I'll edit them.

235
00:12:52.163 --> 00:12:53.724
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

236
00:12:54.163 --> 00:12:55.994
Don't you have any brilliant ideas?

237
00:12:57.763 --> 00:12:58.763
What do you think about pressing charges?

238
00:12:58.763 --> 00:13:00.163
That's already too common.

239
00:13:00.163 --> 00:13:01.303
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:01.474 --> 00:13:03.874
I want each of you to think about five ways in how...

241
00:13:03.874 --> 00:13:05.474
the main character can take revenge on the culprit.

242
00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:06.643
Should we just kill the culprit?

243
00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:08.173
- Kill the culprit? - Here's your latte.

244
00:13:09.214 --> 00:13:12.313
Yes, kill the culprit using the cruelest method you can think of.

245
00:13:12.313 --> 00:13:13.313
Okay.

246
00:13:13.313 --> 00:13:16.913
Summarize what we just discussed, and email it to all the others.

247
00:13:16.913 --> 00:13:18.584
- Okay. - Hey.

248
00:13:19.153 --> 00:13:20.923
How did it feel to sleep in a holding cell?

249
00:13:20.994 --> 00:13:22.454
Did it help you understand the culprit?

250
00:13:22.454 --> 00:13:23.693
Not really.

251
00:13:24.224 --> 00:13:26.494
I think having presumed that I'd be able to understand...

252
00:13:26.494 --> 00:13:29.163
the culprit when I'm not even guilty of anything...

253
00:13:29.163 --> 00:13:30.494
was already wrong to begin with.

254
00:13:30.494 --> 00:13:32.263
I told you it'd be a waste of time.

255
00:13:32.263 --> 00:13:34.504
It's not a waste of time.

256
00:13:34.604 --> 00:13:38.074
The content differs based on whether or not you've experienced it.

257
00:13:38.074 --> 00:13:40.374
- Yes, you're right. - Look at Hyun Soo.

258
00:13:40.374 --> 00:13:43.443
I don't need to tell her what to do. She does stuff on her own.

259
00:13:43.844 --> 00:13:44.913
I like your spirit.

260
00:13:45.384 --> 00:13:46.584
Thank you.

261
00:13:47.043 --> 00:13:49.183
I'll summarize what I've covered at the police station.

262
00:13:49.183 --> 00:13:50.214
Okay.

263
00:13:50.984 --> 00:13:54.084
I'm going to go home and come back tomorrow.

264
00:13:54.224 --> 00:13:56.254
- Give me my coffee. - Here you go.

265
00:13:56.793 --> 00:13:58.724
My mother-in-law says she wants to come visit.

266
00:13:59.263 --> 00:14:01.063
Don't get married. It's horrible.

267
00:14:03.393 --> 00:14:06.364
We'll also work at home and come back tomorrow.

268
00:14:06.464 --> 00:14:08.574
It will air in just a few days, and the director's still shooting.

269
00:14:08.574 --> 00:14:10.004
You girls need to be here.

270
00:14:10.004 --> 00:14:11.403
Hyun Soo, you can go home today.

271
00:14:11.744 --> 00:14:13.403
She worked hard on the cover.

272
00:14:13.704 --> 00:14:15.114
- See you. - Bye.

273
00:14:16.043 --> 00:14:17.214
- Bye. - Bye.

274
00:14:17.214 --> 00:14:18.484
- Work hard. - Okay.

275
00:14:18.484 --> 00:14:19.513
Okay.

276
00:14:21.584 --> 00:14:23.053
I can't believe we have to sleep here again...

277
00:14:23.313 --> 00:14:24.954
when she's going home.

278
00:14:25.523 --> 00:14:27.224
When is she going to finish writing everything?

279
00:14:27.923 --> 00:14:30.023
She's probably going to use the summary as reference.

280
00:14:30.254 --> 00:14:32.063
She can't write anything without us.

281
00:14:32.063 --> 00:14:34.063
Then she's going to take the credit for everything.

282
00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:35.763
If that upsets you, you should succeed.

283
00:14:35.994 --> 00:14:38.104
We need to put up with her until we make our debut as writers.

284
00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:42.173
Please send me the summary of today's meeting via email.

285
00:14:42.704 --> 00:14:45.604
What's wrong? Does it bother you to hear us talk behind her back?

286
00:14:47.004 --> 00:14:48.074
No, that's not it.

287
00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:50.673
You always stay quiet whenever we talk behind her back.

288
00:14:50.813 --> 00:14:52.313
You make us look bad.

289
00:14:53.183 --> 00:14:54.913
It's because she's used to being so polite.

290
00:14:55.354 --> 00:14:57.923
If politeness was a criterion in becoming a writer, you'd make it.

291
00:14:58.653 --> 00:15:00.754
Hyun Soo's worked in a large company before.

292
00:15:01.094 --> 00:15:02.254
She's different from us.

293
00:15:02.254 --> 00:15:04.464
We can't really force ourselves to do things we don't want to do.

294
00:15:06.763 --> 00:15:08.893
That goes the same for me.

295
00:15:10.933 --> 00:15:13.104
Please be consistent in how you choose to treat me.

296
00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:16.104
It's uncomfortable to be criticized and understood at the same time.

297
00:15:18.403 --> 00:15:21.813
Hyun Soo, why are you taking it so seriously?

298
00:15:21.813 --> 00:15:23.943
We were just joking around to relieve our stress.

299
00:15:24.484 --> 00:15:26.683
My goodness, you should go home.

300
00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:28.413
She gave you permission to go home.

301
00:15:30.354 --> 00:15:32.283
My gosh, I can't believe her.

302
00:15:32.283 --> 00:15:35.023
How can she talk back to every word I say?

303
00:15:35.594 --> 00:15:37.964
Is she still here? Hasn't she left yet?

304
00:15:41.594 --> 00:15:43.163
Would you like anything else?

305
00:15:44.763 --> 00:15:48.204
You don't need to care about me. I'm waiting for a friend to come.

306
00:15:48.303 --> 00:15:49.303
Jung Woo!

307
00:15:49.303 --> 00:15:50.474
I'm going to leave in 10 minutes.

308
00:15:50.474 --> 00:15:51.604
I'll see you when you leave then.

309
00:15:52.604 --> 00:15:55.074
Jung Woo, I'm sorry. I'll get on my knees if you want me to.

310
00:15:57.543 --> 00:15:59.344
Don't overreact, and sit down.

311
00:16:02.783 --> 00:16:03.854
Have you eaten?

312
00:16:04.114 --> 00:16:05.724
An idol star is appearing in our drama series.

313
00:16:05.754 --> 00:16:07.183
So we get a lot of food from his fans.

314
00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:09.724
By the way, why do you suddenly want to start a production company?

315
00:16:09.724 --> 00:16:11.824
It's time for me to spend the money I've earned.

316
00:16:12.193 --> 00:16:13.293
I'm going to use my money well.

317
00:16:13.293 --> 00:16:14.964
You're so good at sniffing money.

318
00:16:15.033 --> 00:16:17.763
Why have you still not given me the list of directors?

319
00:16:17.763 --> 00:16:19.864
I don't think you're well aware of this business yet.

320
00:16:19.864 --> 00:16:21.933
A production company makes money by hiring a lot of writers.

321
00:16:22.173 --> 00:16:24.704
Your road to success depends on how many...

322
00:16:24.704 --> 00:16:26.173
competent writers you have.

323
00:16:26.443 --> 00:16:28.374
Do you have any writers you'd like to recommend?

324
00:16:28.374 --> 00:16:31.084
I'm just a production assistant. How would I know a star writer?

325
00:16:32.143 --> 00:16:33.683
But I do know one...

326
00:16:33.913 --> 00:16:35.754
who comes running to me anytime I call her.

327
00:16:36.283 --> 00:16:37.354
What did she write?

328
00:16:37.354 --> 00:16:39.724
She graduated from our school, which kind of makes her your junior too.

329
00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:42.094
She quit working at a nice company.

330
00:16:42.094 --> 00:16:43.994
She now works as an assistant writer and gets paid 800 dollars a month.

331
00:16:43.994 --> 00:16:46.224
Forget it. I hate those kind of people.

332
00:16:46.324 --> 00:16:48.594
Those who are reckless and unrealistic.

333
00:16:48.793 --> 00:16:50.494
I like realistic dramas.

334
00:16:50.663 --> 00:16:52.033
She's really smart.

335
00:16:53.364 --> 00:16:54.604
You should meet her.

336
00:16:55.634 --> 00:16:56.704
No.

337

338
00:17:22.893 --> 00:17:24.134
(Bugger)

339
00:17:24.134 --> 00:17:26.733
When are you coming? Is it okay to sleep outside like this?

340
00:17:27.104 --> 00:17:29.903
You'll ruin yourself before you actually become a writer.

341
00:17:30.134 --> 00:17:31.804
Get me some sanitary pads on your way home.

342
00:17:32.274 --> 00:17:34.003
Buy some instant noodles and spring onions as well.

343
00:17:34.443 --> 00:17:36.443
There's nothing at home.

344
00:17:38.483 --> 00:17:41.683
You can talk all you want. I'm going to go my way.

345
00:17:42.753 --> 00:17:43.983
This is so yummy.

346
00:17:44.324 --> 00:17:45.953
Sweet potato chips are the best.

347
00:17:48.294 --> 00:17:49.824
(Meet me at 3pm tomorrow.)

348
00:17:52.193 --> 00:17:54.834
Meet me at 3pm tomorrow. I'll give you some work.

349
00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.733
Why isn't she replying?

350
00:17:58.733 --> 00:18:00.104
I'm not going to meet her.

351
00:18:00.104 --> 00:18:01.403
She just replied.

352
00:18:03.074 --> 00:18:04.203
Unbelievable.

353
00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:05.443
(Lee Hyun Soo)

354
00:18:06.903 --> 00:18:08.413
(Lee Hyun Soo)

355
00:18:10.443 --> 00:18:12.584
Set a date, so I can meet her. I suddenly want to meet her now.

356
00:18:27.764 --> 00:18:29.864
You haven't even eaten yet. Why are you making meringue?

357
00:18:30.134 --> 00:18:32.003
Don't you think it's time to change the soup?

358
00:18:32.104 --> 00:18:33.364
Are you going to make consomme?

359
00:18:33.503 --> 00:18:34.673
Yes, chef.

360
00:18:35.104 --> 00:18:37.233
You should try developing a single dish.

361
00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:38.673
I'll add that as a special menu.

362
00:18:39.003 --> 00:18:40.304
Thank you, chef.

363
00:18:40.604 --> 00:18:42.374
You can call me by my name when we're alone.

364
00:18:42.374 --> 00:18:43.574
Okay, chef.

365
00:18:45.084 --> 00:18:46.584
It's hard to get along with the others, isn't it?

366
00:18:46.743 --> 00:18:48.213
It's because you got your job through me.

367
00:18:48.354 --> 00:18:51.423
It's okay. I shouldn't be cooking if I'm going to complain about that.

368
00:18:52.183 --> 00:18:53.923
- You should rest today. - No.

369
00:18:53.923 --> 00:18:55.893
You need to at least seem a little approachable.

370
00:18:55.893 --> 00:18:57.393
You should become friends with everyone else.

371
00:18:58.124 --> 00:18:59.463
Teamwork is also part of your competence, you know.

372
00:18:59.963 --> 00:19:02.933
I don't want to purposely seem approachable just to make friends.

373
00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:28.094
My goodness.

374
00:19:38.304 --> 00:19:40.034
My gosh, I can't believe this.

375
00:19:57.213 --> 00:19:58.384
I'll come see you again.

376

<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E01 Temperature of Love "I Will Persue My Dream"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

377
00:20:17.034 --> 00:20:18.344
I totally agree.

378
00:20:18.344 --> 00:20:19.443
- Me too. - Yes.

379
00:20:19.443 --> 00:20:21.574
- It's so funny. - He kept asking...

380
00:20:21.574 --> 00:20:23.114
because he was curious.

381
00:20:23.114 --> 00:20:24.443
- I see. - So I told him.

382
00:20:24.443 --> 00:20:25.443
My gosh.

383
00:20:25.443 --> 00:20:27.584
Haven't you experienced the same thing?

384
00:20:27.584 --> 00:20:28.584
Why are you talking as if...

385
00:20:28.584 --> 00:20:29.854
- you know everything? - Calm down.

386
00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:30.854
We can do it.

387
00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:32.384
- We can do it. - Let's go!

388
00:20:41.493 --> 00:20:42.493
What was that for?

389
00:20:42.663 --> 00:20:44.804
I was checking if you drank after lying to me about...

390
00:20:44.804 --> 00:20:46.564
having to spend the night out for your cover.

391
00:20:46.604 --> 00:20:50.233
What's wrong with you? Would I ever lie to you about that?

392
00:20:50.473 --> 00:20:51.473
No.

393
00:20:52.203 --> 00:20:54.614
But you never know. People always change.

394
00:21:01.183 --> 00:21:02.584
Why did you buy this one?

395
00:21:02.884 --> 00:21:04.213
You use that one.

396
00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.753
I needed the ones without wings.

397
00:21:07.324 --> 00:21:08.393
Go back, and exchange these.

398
00:21:09.524 --> 00:21:10.524
Me?

399
00:21:11.723 --> 00:21:12.864
Then who else?

400
00:21:13.963 --> 00:21:14.963
You can go yourself.

401
00:21:18.203 --> 00:21:20.134
Why didn't you pay for last month's living expenses?

402
00:21:22.774 --> 00:21:25.304
To be exact, I couldn't pay.

403
00:21:25.544 --> 00:21:26.844
That's why I shopped for groceries.

404
00:21:26.844 --> 00:21:28.544
You can't end the deal with this.

405
00:21:28.544 --> 00:21:30.743
We're sisters. That's something you can always do for me.

406
00:21:30.743 --> 00:21:33.884
Can't you use that generosity on living expenses as well?

407
00:21:33.884 --> 00:21:36.683
No. Food and money are different.

408
00:21:36.683 --> 00:21:38.253
How are they different?

409
00:21:38.723 --> 00:21:40.884
I do all sorts of chores for you.

410
00:21:41.054 --> 00:21:43.923
If you convert my labor into money, I don't owe you anything.

411
00:21:44.193 --> 00:21:46.223
It's been five months since you haven't paid for living expenses.

412
00:21:49.764 --> 00:21:51.134
I'll go exchange them for you.

413
00:21:54.034 --> 00:21:56.703
This is why you shouldn't have quit your job,

414
00:21:56.703 --> 00:21:58.943
especially when it's a huge company that everyone wants to work at.

415
00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:01.574
There she goes again. She's making it obvious that she's a teacher.

416
00:22:01.574 --> 00:22:03.074
I can't stand her trying to lecture me.

417
00:22:03.344 --> 00:22:06.114
I can't even talk about you anywhere because I'm so embarrassed.

418
00:22:06.114 --> 00:22:08.653
You're so pathetic. Until when are you going to depend on me?

419
00:22:08.653 --> 00:22:10.653
You need to wake up.

420
00:22:10.653 --> 00:22:12.354
How much is your monthly pay?

421
00:22:22.393 --> 00:22:25.364
Why are you looking at me like that? And what's that smile on your face?

422
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:31.243
Did you imagine spraying this ketchup on me?

423
00:22:34.743 --> 00:22:37.243
How will you write dramas when you can't even lie properly?

424
00:22:37.473 --> 00:22:39.014
It's not too late.

425
00:22:39.014 --> 00:22:40.384
Just prepare for the government official exams.

426
00:22:40.584 --> 00:22:42.153
I wonder what Mom and Dad will think of you now.

427
00:22:42.153 --> 00:22:44.784
They've been only saying good things about you.

428
00:22:44.784 --> 00:22:46.483
Always nagging me to be like you.

429
00:22:46.483 --> 00:22:49.854
When are you going to get out of that idea?

430
00:22:49.854 --> 00:22:52.324
When are you going to stop your stupid psychoanalysis?

431
00:22:52.723 --> 00:22:54.733
I'll just stop talking. What did I expect?

432
00:22:57.604 --> 00:22:58.634
Hey!

433
00:23:04.304 --> 00:23:05.673
I shouldn't be too upset.

434
00:23:06.304 --> 00:23:08.774
She just got dumped. She's in a state of panic.

435
00:23:08.774 --> 00:23:10.374
She can be obsessed with food.

436
00:23:10.374 --> 00:23:11.584
I don't need your sympathy.

437
00:23:14.183 --> 00:23:16.453
I'm not obsessed with food just because I got dumped by him.

438
00:23:22.253 --> 00:23:23.753
I lost.

439
00:23:30.294 --> 00:23:31.334
Drink that.

440
00:23:31.963 --> 00:23:33.933
How could you make me wait?

441
00:23:33.933 --> 00:23:36.074
You should've gotten there first and waited for me.

442
00:23:36.334 --> 00:23:37.774
You know who I am.

443
00:23:37.774 --> 00:23:40.173
I ran to here as soon as I finished my work in Ganghwa.

444
00:23:41.044 --> 00:23:43.114
It's a bit spicy. What is this?

445
00:23:43.114 --> 00:23:44.913
I blended coriander powder with basil.

446
00:23:45.284 --> 00:23:46.844
My brother got coriander powder from India for me.

447
00:23:47.143 --> 00:23:49.653
I like this kind of taste. You were being considerate, weren't you?

448
00:23:50.784 --> 00:23:53.253
I forgive you for making me wait.

449
00:23:53.354 --> 00:23:54.594
Thank you.

450
00:23:55.794 --> 00:23:57.824
Should we pick up Hyun Soo on our way?

451
00:23:58.524 --> 00:23:59.993
Just be loyal to me.

452
00:24:01.193 --> 00:24:03.064
I went to Jung Sun's restaurant earlier.

453
00:24:03.294 --> 00:24:05.733
How come he doesn't have a cellphone in the 21st century?

454
00:24:05.733 --> 00:24:07.364
He has his own way of living.

455
00:24:07.774 --> 00:24:08.834
So is he coming?

456
00:24:09.173 --> 00:24:11.804
He is. He does everything I say.

457
00:24:11.804 --> 00:24:13.443
He doesn't.

458
00:24:13.443 --> 00:24:15.844
He just does what he feels like doing.

459
00:24:16.074 --> 00:24:17.844
I'm the only loyal one here.

460
00:24:18.084 --> 00:24:19.443
Why are you emphasizing that?

461
00:24:19.544 --> 00:24:21.814
I'm just saying I'm happy about it.

462
00:24:43.473 --> 00:24:44.673
What is that?

463
00:24:45.544 --> 00:24:48.243
Is that a letter? Or is it a writing?

464
00:24:49.713 --> 00:24:51.483
What's that dressing on his hand?

465
00:24:52.183 --> 00:24:53.884
He has a knife scar on his arm.

466
00:24:54.584 --> 00:24:55.584
Is he in a gang?

467
00:25:03.624 --> 00:25:04.693
Do I know you?

468
00:25:06.393 --> 00:25:07.764
No, you don't. Why?

469
00:25:08.733 --> 00:25:10.193
You've been staring at me for a while.

470
00:25:11.264 --> 00:25:12.334
I'm sorry.

471
00:25:15.104 --> 00:25:16.834
Why is she not here yet?

472
00:25:18.473 --> 00:25:20.344
- Hyun Soo! - Hey!

473
00:25:20.344 --> 00:25:22.044
You are early! You too!

474
00:25:22.743 --> 00:25:24.344
- I haven't seen you for a while. - I know.

475
00:25:25.483 --> 00:25:27.143
- Hi, Jung Sun! - Hey.

476
00:25:28.384 --> 00:25:30.923
Do you guys know each other?

477
00:25:30.983 --> 00:25:32.024
You know him too.

478
00:25:32.624 --> 00:25:34.024
We've met online already.

479
00:25:34.524 --> 00:25:35.554
He's Kind Soup.

480
00:25:36.153 --> 00:25:37.153
You are Jane.

481
00:25:42.993 --> 00:25:46.264
What is this? That's fancy. Look at mine.

482
00:25:46.264 --> 00:25:47.304
I'll keep your phone for you.

483
00:25:47.733 --> 00:25:50.374
It's okay. I don't want to cause any inconvenience.

484
00:25:50.703 --> 00:25:52.473
What do you mean? It's nothing

485
00:25:52.643 --> 00:25:54.143
You are too independent.

486
00:25:54.973 --> 00:25:55.973
Well, if you insist...

487
00:25:57.913 --> 00:25:59.983
Everyone! Come over here!

488
00:26:00.713 --> 00:26:02.253
As you know, today's running routes are...

489
00:26:02.253 --> 00:26:05.884
Gyeongbok Palace, Samcheong-dong, Bukchon, Insa-dong, and...

490
00:26:05.884 --> 00:26:09.524
Chenggyecheon, Gwanghwamun, and back to Gyeongbok Palace again.

491
00:26:09.893 --> 00:26:11.824
After a warm-up, we'll break into small groups.

492
00:26:11.824 --> 00:26:14.364
You can group yourselves by your pace.

493
00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:16.794
That means I can't run with you guys.

494
00:26:17.094 --> 00:26:18.903
You can be kkakdugi, the weakest one in the group.

495
00:26:19.364 --> 00:26:21.874
I like Kkakdugi. I want to eat it now.

496
00:26:22.834 --> 00:26:24.844
Do you want me to make you some?

497
00:26:25.304 --> 00:26:26.844
Radish from Ganghwa is amazing!

498
00:26:27.003 --> 00:26:29.574
- What do you think of that? - I love it.

499
00:26:29.973 --> 00:26:32.913
Look how happy you guys are.

500
00:26:35.653 --> 00:26:37.084
My knees are hurting already.

501
00:27:08.453 --> 00:27:09.614
Oh, my goodness.

502
00:27:14.923 --> 00:27:16.594
Hyun Soo! Run faster!

503
00:27:17.354 --> 00:27:19.064
If you take a break, you'll feel worse.

504
00:27:19.294 --> 00:27:20.624
You have to keep running.

505
00:27:20.993 --> 00:27:22.064
Does he think I don't know that?

506
00:27:25.604 --> 00:27:27.534
If you know it, then do it. You should be running.

507
00:27:29.233 --> 00:27:32.544
If your legs feel too heavy, try to move your arms at least.

508
00:27:32.943 --> 00:27:34.643
- Like this. - Like this?

509
00:27:34.643 --> 00:27:37.443
That's right. Now you have to go forward.

510
00:27:38.213 --> 00:27:40.243
I'm sorry, but I can't. You go first. I'll take care of myself.

511
00:27:42.253 --> 00:27:43.614
Are you going to give up?

512
00:27:43.614 --> 00:27:45.324
- Can't I? - No, you can't.

513
00:27:45.324 --> 00:27:48.453
I'm a pacemaker. I never let anyone give up.

514
00:27:48.923 --> 00:27:50.094
That's a problem.

515
00:27:50.354 --> 00:27:52.364
Your problem's based on your obsession for achievement.

516
00:27:52.364 --> 00:27:54.933
You shouldn't feel guilty about giving up. It's not good for you.

517
00:27:55.163 --> 00:27:57.604
You are really good at talking. I love that.

518
00:27:58.003 --> 00:27:59.034
Let's talk about it while running.

519
00:28:00.364 --> 00:28:02.874
Hyun Soo. Let's drink beer after this!

520
00:28:03.433 --> 00:28:05.673
That motivates me.

521
00:28:06.074 --> 00:28:07.544
I can do this!

522
00:28:09.874 --> 00:28:11.014
By the way,

523
00:28:11.443 --> 00:28:12.814
don't run behind me.

524
00:28:13.443 --> 00:28:15.814
If I run, that's because I want to run.

525
00:28:17.884 --> 00:28:18.884
I see.

526
00:28:26.693 --> 00:28:27.764
Goodness.

527
00:28:29.493 --> 00:28:30.634
How...

528
00:28:36.203 --> 00:28:37.233
What?

529
00:29:01.163 --> 00:29:02.534
I didn't know I could still find somewhere like this.

530
00:29:04.663 --> 00:29:05.663
This is amazing.

531
00:29:11.844 --> 00:29:12.903
Where's Hyun Soo?

532
00:29:14.274 --> 00:29:16.774
I think she's left behind again. I'll go look for her.

533
00:29:17.344 --> 00:29:19.443
I think I know where she is.

534
00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:26.467
(Episode 2 will air shortly.)
