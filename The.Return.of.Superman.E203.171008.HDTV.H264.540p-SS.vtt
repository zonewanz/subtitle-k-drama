00:00:00.047 --> 00:00:02.716
(Parental guidance advised...)

2
00:00:02.716 --> 00:00:04.768
(for viewers under the age of 12.)

3
00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:07.689
On one wonderful autumn day,

4
00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.689
the families have gathered at a village school.

5
00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.429
What will unfold here this time?

6
00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.499
The cat is sitting.

7
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.529
It's so cute.

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.499
(The kids are excited not knowing what's ahead.)

9
00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:21.470
There are 3 or 4.

10
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.839
(There is no point.)

11
00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:27.680
(This might be paradise.)

12
00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.710
Why is there such a commotion outside?

13
00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.390
(Why is there such a commotion outside?)

14
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.049
(The Master of this bunch appears.)

15
00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:39.989
Why are you all making a racket?

16
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.159
(Freezing in place)

17
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.589
Isn't this man...

18
00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.570
(The twins visited the school last year.)

19
00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.830
(One word from the Master...)

20
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.900
(incited tears.)

21
00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.710
Those of you who don't make it must live with me.

22
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.640
(This chaotic school is full of wails.)

23
00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.710
(The tiger Master has arrived.)

24
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.719
Why is there such a commotion outside?

25
00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:08.619
Why is there such a racket?

26
00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.690
(Feeling alarmed)

27
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.619
The adorable little rascals have arrived.

28
00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.160
Yes, I'm here.

29
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.430
(Seung Jae is here.)

30
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.729
Are you Seung Jae?

31
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.400
You adorable rascal.

32
00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:27.100
You've met me before, Seo Jun and Seo Eon.

33
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.940
Shouldn't you two be giving me a hug?

34
00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.339
(Seo Eon takes courage and gives him a hug.)

35
00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:35.010
There, there.

36
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.949
We met last year, right?

37
00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:38.050
Yes.

38
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.479
All right. Now who are you?

39
00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:42.949
- Kids. - We're Seol A and Soo A.

40
00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:44.419
You're Seol A and Soo A.

41
00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:46.490
I'm Si An.

42
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.559
You're Daebak, aren't you?

43
00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:49.960
No, I'm Si An.

44
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.130
Haven't you heard of Daebak?

45
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.199
That's strange. I've heard that there's a Daebak.

46
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.070
Uncle, what is this?

47
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.669
Uncle? I'm not your uncle.

48
00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:00.169
(He's never had to deal with toddlers before.)

49
00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:01.440
Grandpa.

50
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.570
- What is that, grandpa? - So you're...

51
00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:04.940
- This? - Yes.

52
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.410
Why do you...

53
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.149
speak informally and out of turn?

54
00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.780
(Seung Jae doesn't have a clue.)

55
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.220
(His little laughter will subside.)

56
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.690
(Roaring)

57
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.419
(What will happen to this little lovely bundle?)

58
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.459
- Grandpa, what is that? - Yes?

59
00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.229
This...

60
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.229
(Spreading open)

61
00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.870
- This is a fan. - It's...

62
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.870
- like a rainbow. - A rainbow?

63
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.209
You're a smart one, aren't you?

64
00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.169
I love you, grandpa.

65
00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.440
(They just met, but he loves him.)

66
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.049
Goodness. Come here. I'll give you another hug.

67
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.280
- You love grandpa? - Yes.

68
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.549
Now bring your belongings and step down here.

69
00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.859
Put on your backpacks and step down.

70
00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.429
Bring everything.

71
00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.359
Come here with all your stuff.

72
00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.859
- Are you all here? - Yes.

73
00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.100
Now you must listen to what I say.

74
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.769
How must you address me?

75
00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.870
- What... - Grandpa.

76
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.940
Grandpa? What else?

77
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.010
- Teacher. - What else?

78
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.479
Angel.

79
00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.280
Angel? Fair enough.

80
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.410
(Feeling flustered)

81
00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.179
Now listen well.

82
00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:20.049
This is the village school.

83
00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.820
You will study manners and etiquette...

84
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.690
and how to be dutiful to your parents.

85
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.090
If you're asked who the teacher is...

86
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.389
Look this way!

87
00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.290
I'm to be addressed as "Master".

88
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.459
How must I be addressed?

89
00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.729
- Master. - Master.

90
00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.000
- As what? - Master.

91
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.970
- Master. - Master.

92
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.840
Take out the contents of your bags...

93
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.970
so I can inspect them.

94
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.139
Take off your bags and spread them out.

95
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.910
There you go. You too.

96
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.739
Pour everything out in front of you.

97
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.079
Take everything out. There you go.

98
00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.519
I want to see what you all brought.

99
00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.120
Whether they're tasty food or toys,

100
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.320
I want to see them.

101
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.760
Place all your belongings in front of you.

102
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.620
There you go.

103
00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.329
Place it right there. There you go.

104
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.600
What did you bring, Seol A?

105
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.470
I brought earrings, a ring, and a tiara.

106
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.340
What did you bring these for?

107
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.870
I wanted to give them to my friends.

108
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.709
To give them to your friends?

109
00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.440
Who do you want to give these to then?

110
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.510
Seo Jun and Seo Eon.

111
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.310
(What? A tiara?)

112
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.849
Seo Jun and Seo Eon?

113
00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.149
Who do you want to give this tiara to?

114
00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.920
Who will be crowned?

115
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.889
(Seo Jun has been crowned.)

116
00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.990
It turned out to be Seo Jun.

117
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.060
(Grinning)

118
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.760
(You sure know how to judge character.)

119
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.490
Thank you.

120
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.060
What did you bring?

121
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.430
I brought sausages and jellies.

122
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.039
Jellies? What's this?

123
00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.300
It's mine?

124
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.139
What's his name?

125
00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.279
- He's Jjang An. - Jjang An?

126
00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:53.909
Is he your friend?

127
00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.579
- Now what's this? - This?

128
00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.680
- A top? - A top?

129
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.250
Back in the day, I had to whip it.

130
00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.149
How does it work?

131
00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.560
(He shows off his top to the Master.)

132
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.719
Let me see.

133
00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.230
Is that how it's done?

134
00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.230
You sure brought a lot of things.

135
00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.430
How about you Lo Hee?

136
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.399
- It's over here. - Did you bring a rabbit?

137
00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.440
- Is this yours? - Yes.

138
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.940
You speak very well.

139
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.610
Can you give this to me?

140
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.550
It's cute. All right.

141
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.849
- Lo Hee... - Here.

142
00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.149
You can have it, Master.

143
00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:34.149
(You can have this.)

144
00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.889
You addressed me properly.

145
00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.089
But you can't speak informally.

146
00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.389
You must show respect.

147
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.430
Please, receive this, Master.

148
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.099
You must give it to me with two hands.

149
00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:48.769
Thank you.

150
00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.240
Seung Jae, you're going to become somebody.

151
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.370
What does that mean?

152
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.579
It means that you're going to be a big person.

153
00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.980
Now what are these, Seung Jae.

154
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.349
They're dinosaurs.

155
00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:03.649
- Dinosaurs? - Yes.

156
00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:06.380
Now you're going to step forward.

157
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.990
All place all toys and food...

158
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.320
into the basket.

159
00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:12.789
(What?)

160
00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.459
You're going to place them in here.

161
00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:17.459
I will be keeping them for you...

162
00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:21.260
until it's time for you all to go home.

163
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.329
(Eyes opening wide)

164
00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.399
I don't want to.

165
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.180
Must you listen to me or not?

166
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.610
I don't have to.

167
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.909
(You're going to get in trouble.)

168
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.050
(Oh, gosh. I'm nervous.)

169
00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.019
(Glaring)

170
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.519
(Maybe this isn't it.)

171
00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.789
- I have to listen to you. - That's right.

172
00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.159
Place everything inside.

173
00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.490
Everything. Place everything inside.

174
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.690
All your belongings.

175
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.760
I will return everything when it's time to leave.

176
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.130
Place everything inside. Good.

177
00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.639
You too, Lo Hee.

178
00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.170
Good. Lo Hee is very obedient.

179
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.539
In a moment...

180
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.110
(You're a little prankster, like me.)

181
00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:09.880
An established prankster recognizes a newcomer.

182
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.449
(Don't run around. You'll get in trouble.)

183
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.589
(Stay still.)

184
00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:19.190
(The best similar-aged duo is featured together.)

185
00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:21.760
It's mischievous Seung Jae...

186
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.789
and Si An, the model student.

187
00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:27.500
The great duo is born.

188
00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:30.930
(Hey, let's eat a chili pepper.)

189
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.639
(That's going to kill us.)

190
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.269
With the four of them together,

191
00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:38.370
there is nothing to fear.

192
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.510
It's the oldest Seol A and Soo A...

193
00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:42.610
and the trustworthy twins, Seo Eon and Seo Jun.

194
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.250
And the adorable...

195
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.980
younger toddlers of The Return of Superman.

196
00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.389
(Chic and proud)

197
00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:52.620
Lo Hee, the chic princess.

198
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.760
(I am superbly cute.)

199
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.130
And the captivatingly cute baby, Will.

200
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.599
(Will)

201
00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:04.230
Will they get along with the fierce Master?

202
00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:07.399
The Return of Superman, Chuseok Holiday Special.

203
00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:09.870
"Wisdom Grows Like a Ripening Grain."

204
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.579
(They change and gather inside.)

205
00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:16.250
The children finally head inside for their lessons.

206
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.820
Let's all go inside.

207
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.449
They must sit according to indicating stickers.

208
00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:25.420
You're over here.

209
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.719
- How about me? - You?

210
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.929
- Over there? - You're here, Soo A.

211
00:08:30.929 --> 00:08:33.029
This is your spot, Seung Jae.

212
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:35.269
This is your spot.

213
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.130
Soo A, sit over there, and I'm here.

214
00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:39.139
(Where is my spot?)

215
00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:41.340
Lo Hee, you're over here.

216
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.569
This is your spot, Lo Hee.

217
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.309
(Seo Jun the gentleman holds her spot.)

218
00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:47.639
You're over there.

219
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.409
(Wiggling)

220
00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:51.210
(Thank you, everyone.)

221
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.179
Even Lo Hee, the youngest, sit down calmly.

222
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.149
(Seung Jae tip-toes away.)

223
00:08:57.149 --> 00:08:59.090
Where are you going, Seung Jae?

224
00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:03.230
(He lays on Seol A's back.)

225
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.429
- Do you like me? - Yes.

226
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.630
(Squirming about)

227
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.069
(Humming)

228
00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:18.210
Seung Jae, if you keep this up,

229
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.240
Master will scold you.

230
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.649
(Seung Jae is fond of Seol A and Soo A.)

231
00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:25.850
Hey, Seung Jae.

232
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.049
You're going to get in trouble.

233
00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:30.319
(He finds her front bangs fascinating.)

234
00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:31.990
Stop that.

235
00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:33.960
Surprise.

236
00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:36.059
You're mine.

237
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.029
You're mine.

238
00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:40.159
Hey, Seung Jae.

239
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.429
(Aren't you taking this too far?)

240
00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:45.600
You can't do that.

241
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.200
Stop.

242
00:09:47.669 --> 00:09:49.569
(Trembling)

243
00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:51.909
(Gosh. We're on edge.)

244
00:09:51.909 --> 00:09:53.279
Stop it.

245
00:09:53.539 --> 00:09:55.610
You can't scold him, Si An.

246
00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.279
You can't do that, Si An.

247
00:09:58.279 --> 00:09:59.980
(Okay, sister.)

248
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.519
Why are you making such a commotion?

249
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.090
Who is fooling around?

250
00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:06.659
(Flinching)

251
00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:09.559
Sit down at your places, you little rascals.

252
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.659
It's time to study.

253
00:10:11.659 --> 00:10:13.500
Is it okay to fool around or not?

254
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.429
Okay. I'm sitting.

255
00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:18.269
(Seung Jae hasn't grasped the situation yet.)

256
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:19.899
Is it okay to fool around or not?

257
00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:21.840
(Tapping)

258
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.340
What do you think this is?

259
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.380
(Even Seung Jae, who is usually bright,)

260
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.880
(is intimidated.)

261
00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:29.710
- It's wood. - Wood.

262
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.880
- It's wood. - Wood.

263
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.480
- It is wood, right? - Yes.

264
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.850
What do you think it is used for?

265
00:10:36.149 --> 00:10:37.319
For drumming.

266
00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:39.819
Drumming? You mean like this?

267
00:10:39.819 --> 00:10:40.990
Like this?

268
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.990
Yes.

269
00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:44.889
This is called a "switch".

270
00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:46.460
Follow after me. Say, "switch".

271
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.230
- Switch. - Switch.

272
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.970
This is how it's used. Listen well.

273
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:51.970
- All right. - All right.

274
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.769
It's for those of you who do not obey.

275
00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:55.909
Also, for those of you that cry.

276
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.439
For those of you who don't follow manners...

277
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.710
or show respect to your parents.

278
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.309
It's a good idea to study hard, right?

279
00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:04.450
- Yes. - Yes.

280
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.779
(The switch silences Seung Jae.)

281
00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:09.189
The room, which was noisy just a moment ago,

282
00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:11.990
has found order thanks to a single stick.

283
00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:14.889
Before we begin our studies,

284
00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:17.090
we will select a class president.

285
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.659
Raise your hands if you want to give it a try.

286
00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:21.730
Me.

287
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.370
Me.

288
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.669
Hold up your hands.

289
00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:28.000
- Me. - Hold them up.

290
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.269
Me, Si An.

291
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.510
- Okay. - Me, Si An.

292
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.539
Got it, Si An. Okay.

293
00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:34.740
- Me, me. - Tell me...

294
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.649
why you want to be the class president.

295
00:11:37.649 --> 00:11:39.350
(I want that.)

296
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.080
I want that.

297
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.950
You want to become class president to eat that?

298
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.450
- Yes. - Fair enough.

299
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.159
(He's been eyeing them before the selection.)

300
00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:51.789
He's been eyeing the yakgwa since class began.

301
00:11:51.789 --> 00:11:53.299
- Before we begin... - Master,

302
00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:54.960
why are those there?

303
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.639
I'm going to be gifting those out later.

304
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.340
- Gifts? - Don't they seem tasty?

305
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.470
Yes.

306
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.240
You want to become class president to eat that?

307
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.439
- Yes. - Fair enough.

308
00:12:06.439 --> 00:12:08.039
How about you, Seo Eon?

309
00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:12.120
I will listen to my mom.

310
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.620
Will you listen to your mother if you're chosen?

311
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.620
Yes.

312
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.590
But there are responsibilities to keep.

313
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.760
You have to perform chores for me.

314
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.760
And if your friends misbehave,

315
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.799
you might get spanked on their behalf.

316
00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:30.029
Raise your hands if you're still interested.

317
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:32.569
(Gosh)

318
00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:36.139
(Forget it)

319
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.470
Me.

320
00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:38.840
Me too.

321
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.639
(The 2 brave 4-year-olds)

322
00:12:41.639 --> 00:12:42.679
Me.

323
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.480
You two play rock-paper-scissors.

324
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.779
- Rock-paper... - Rock-paper...

325
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.620
- Scissors. - Scissors.

326
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.620
(Scissors wins, paper loses.)

327
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.360
I won.

328
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.090
You're the class president.

329
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.360
We'll pick you, okay?

330
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:57.789
Now, let's applause...

331
00:12:57.789 --> 00:13:00.360
and congratulate our class president.

332
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.769
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

333
00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:06.269
As the class president, you must watch out...

334
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:10.669
for those who do not obey and fool around.

335
00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:13.039
- All right. - Okay. There.

336
00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:15.980
Now we will begin our lesson on etiquettes.

337
00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.850
Place your hands like this and say, "attention".

338
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.819
(The two eldest boys follow along well.)

339
00:13:20.819 --> 00:13:21.950
Attention.

340
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.289
- Attention. - Attention.

341
00:13:23.289 --> 00:13:25.889
Say, "Hello, Master".

342
00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:29.260
- Hello, Master. - Hello, Master.

343
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.189
Now, take your seats.

344
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:32.360
Take your seats.

345
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.960
Sit on top of your cushions,

346
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.069
and sit cross-legged.

347
00:13:36.299 --> 00:13:37.630
Good. Straighten your backs.

348
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.840
Correct posture.

349
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.370
- Correct posture. - Correct posture.

350
00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:44.569
What do you think this character means?

351
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.539
"Hyo" stands for showing devotion to your parents.

352
00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:48.950
Repeat after me, "Respect your parents".

353
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.880
- Respect your parents. - Respect your parents.

354
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.980
Now who give it a try?

355
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.319
- I can. - Give it a try, Seo Eon.

356
00:13:56.319 --> 00:13:58.350
Respect your parents.

357
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.559
Great job. 100 percent.

358
00:14:01.059 --> 00:14:03.130
Who else can do it?

359
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.889
- Go ahead, Seo Jun. - Respect your parents.

360
00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:07.230
Respect your parents.

361
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.429
Great job. Applaud.

362
00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:10.630
- Good job, Seo Jun. - I want to try.

363
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.899
- Give it a try, Si An. - Respect your parents.

364
00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:14.439
- What? - Respect your parents.

365
00:14:14.439 --> 00:14:16.169
You get a 100 percent, class president.

366
00:14:16.169 --> 00:14:18.539
Respect your parents.

367
00:14:18.539 --> 00:14:20.779
Respect your parents.

368
00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:22.580
Great job. Applaud.

369
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.110
Soo A too.

370
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.880
Okay, Soo A.

371
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.850
She didn't do it.

372
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.490
(He's sure my brother.)

373
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.960
Give it a try, Soo A.

374
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.720
Respect your parents.

375
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.689
Great job. Applaud.

376
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.860
Everyone got it.

377
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.860
Where do sons and daughters belong?

378
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.429
They're beneath their parents.

379
00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:45.500
The characters for "parents" are above.

380
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.539
Characters for "son" and "daughter" are below.

381
00:14:47.539 --> 00:14:50.510
"Ja" stands for son.

382
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.439
On top, is "No", which stands for "elderly".

383
00:14:53.439 --> 00:14:55.450
Here is "father" and "mother".

384
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.980
Children are meant to be under their parents.

385
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.580
Do you follow that order?

386
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.189
No, we don't.

387
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:04.419
- You don't, right? - I don't as well.

388
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.960
Then where are you?

389
00:15:07.289 --> 00:15:08.460
I'm on top.

390
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:10.990
You're on top?

391
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.059
- Yes. - How come?

392
00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:14.429
My mom, dad, Seo Eon, and myself...

393
00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:16.700
are all on top.

394
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.069
But children should be beneath their parents.

395
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:22.309
All four of us are on top.

396
00:15:22.809 --> 00:15:25.010
Because I'm handsome,

397
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.309
I was born first.

398
00:15:27.309 --> 00:15:29.750
- You were born first? - No, it was me.

399
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.880
- That's not true. - You're wrong.

400
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.189
I'm always first, so I was born first.

401
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:39.319
No, I was born first.

402
00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:42.289
That's not true. I was born first.

403
00:15:42.289 --> 00:15:43.330
No.

404
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.500
- At first... - I'll tidy it up.

405
00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:48.029
You're the younger brother, right?

406
00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:49.769
She's your dear older sister, right?

407
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.200
She's not.

408
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.970
- Then who is she? - She's my sister.

409
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.799
(She's just my sister.)

410
00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:58.010
Yes, true. But a long time ago,

411
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.510
people showed respect to their older sisters.

412
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.350
- Try it. - She's just Seol A.

413
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.750
Then...

414
00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:06.620
I got it.

415
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.789
(He gives up.)

416
00:16:09.149 --> 00:16:12.289
Raise your hands if you're...

417
00:16:12.289 --> 00:16:14.760
rude and informal to your fathers.

418
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.330
(Being careful)

419
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.429
Who speaks informally and says,

420
00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:20.200
"What are you doing, dad?" and "Come here, mom"?

421
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.669
Raise your hands if you do.

422
00:16:22.669 --> 00:16:24.799
I'm never informal.

423
00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:26.139
- You're not? - Yes.

424
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.769
Really?

425
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:28.840
- Yes. - I kiss him.

426
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.840
You gave him a kiss?

427
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.480
I've heard that one of you poked his behind.

428
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.639
Who was it?

429
00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:36.080
(Feeling pangs)

430
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.120
(They've taken a liking to the prank lately.)

431
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.689
Poke, poke, poke.

432
00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:46.360
Did you do that, Seo Eon?

433
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.289
We did it together.

434
00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:51.830
You both poked your father's behind?

435
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:52.860
Yes.

436
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.360
You can't do that.

437
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.529
- You can't do that, okay? - Yes, master.

438
00:16:56.529 --> 00:16:59.139
I've also heard that one of you...

439
00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:01.439
sprays water on your father.

440
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.109
On the face. Who is it?

441
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.740
- It wasn't me. - Was it you, Seung Jae?

442
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.910
No.

443
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.210
Your nose will get longer if you lie.

444
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.579
That's right. Just like Pinocchio.

445
00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.119
It wasn't me.

446
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.950
You have to be honest. You mustn't lie.

447
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.059
Who sprayed their father in the face?

448
00:17:20.059 --> 00:17:21.160
Raise your hand.

449
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.059
I did it a while ago.

450
00:17:24.059 --> 00:17:26.730
- You did to it, right? - Yes.

451
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.099
(He poured water on his hungover father.)

452
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.640
(A gift of water)

453
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.079
You poke your parents in the rear...

454
00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:41.480
and pour water on them.

455
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.079
Is that acceptable or not?

456
00:17:43.079 --> 00:17:44.379
- It's not. - It's not, right?

457
00:17:44.379 --> 00:17:47.879
Si An, is your father old or young?

458
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.349
He's young.

459
00:17:49.349 --> 00:17:50.490
He's young.

460
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.859
Seo Eon, is your father old or young?

461
00:17:53.859 --> 00:17:54.960
He's old.

462
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.089
He's old?

463
00:17:56.629 --> 00:17:58.900
(Sorry, Hwi Jae.)

464
00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:01.400
Does he have facial hair?

465
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.799
Yes, a little bit.

466
00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:03.799
A little bit?

467
00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:06.299
- I see. - My dad doesn't have any.

468
00:18:06.299 --> 00:18:09.809
My dad doesn't have hair or a beard.

469
00:18:10.269 --> 00:18:12.740
(My ear is itching suddenly.)

470
00:18:13.379 --> 00:18:16.180
Seung Jae isn't really that mischievous.

471
00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.410
He changes based on his mood.

472
00:18:18.779 --> 00:18:20.849
His fluctuations are pretty severe.

473
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.019
He's up when he's playing.

474
00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:26.890
Did you get ambushed while laying down?

475
00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.319
- Yes, very often. - Really?

476
00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:30.490
There are low blows...

477
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.900
- and even elbows. - I see.

478
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.599
- And 1-2 punches. - I see.

479
00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:38.069
My kids learned about poking people in the rear.

480
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.599
They do it all the time now. But...

481
00:18:40.839 --> 00:18:41.970
(He can't fathom.)

482
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.039
These don't apply to me.

483
00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:45.039
- Really? - Yes.

484
00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:46.710
How does Lo Hee wake you up then?

485
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.710
She buries her face in my chest...

486
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.750
and says, "Daddy. I like you."

487
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.519
Then she kisses me.

488
00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:56.420
(Sighing)

489
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.450
That's how I'm woken up.

490
00:18:59.289 --> 00:19:00.890
She asks me to get up.

491
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.829
(Sons versus daughters)

492
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.430
That's so ideal.

493
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.059
I have something to say.

494
00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:07.599
- You've something to say? - Yes.

495
00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:09.799
I love you, Daddy.

496
00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:12.140
(Lo Hee loves her dad.)

497
00:19:12.599 --> 00:19:14.269
- Really? - Yes.

498
00:19:14.269 --> 00:19:16.240
(This is how mornings begin for this father.)

499
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.879
I get side-kicked and karate-chopped.

500
00:19:19.879 --> 00:19:22.250
We have to play with them physically.

501
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.150
It's a UFC match at home everyday.

502
00:19:27.019 --> 00:19:29.750
Meanwhile, another father with a son is on his way.

503
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.789
(William is here.)

504
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:33.859
William.

505
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.430
Can you see outside?

506
00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:38.829
It's all rice outside.

507
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.129
What is it that you eat? Say, "rice".

508
00:19:42.269 --> 00:19:44.529
Rice. Rice, rice.

509
00:19:44.529 --> 00:19:46.599
(Rice, rice, rice)

510
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.500
Hey, William.

511
00:19:48.569 --> 00:19:50.369
We're late...

512
00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:54.839
because you cried and pooped in the morning.

513
00:19:55.579 --> 00:19:57.309
(I feel falsely accused.)

514
00:19:57.309 --> 00:19:58.920
That's why we're late.

515
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.690
We haven't been in the car for so long, right?

516
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.760
- You're right. - Okay.

517
00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:10.260
Still, you're handling it well.

518
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.900
(He claps for himself.)

519
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.660
Hey, William. Today,

520
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.200
we'll be meeting the whole gang.

521
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:22.140
(Hurry up.)

522
00:20:23.109 --> 00:20:25.379
It's your first time at a school, right?

523
00:20:25.539 --> 00:20:27.879
What will happen there?

524
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.250
We'll be going that way.

525
00:20:32.619 --> 00:20:34.349
(William is excited.)

526
00:20:34.349 --> 00:20:35.420
Hey, William.

527
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:37.589
This is a scary place.

528
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.089
You have to behave.

529
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.690
What's over there, William? What is that?

530
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.700
It's a goat. Bleat.

531
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.359
Bleat.

532
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.970
Bleat.

533
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.670
(He does a gruff impression.)

534
00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:57.109
There you go.

535
00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.879
All right. Let's walk.

536
00:21:01.579 --> 00:21:02.710
Don't run.

537
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.379
Don't run.

538
00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:09.049
- Sam. - Hello.

539
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:10.319
Hello.

540
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:12.319
How you doing, man?

541
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.760
- Hello. - Hello.

542
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.460
It's been a while.

543
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.760
He's such a doll.

544
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.329
(Nice to meet you, uncles.)

545
00:21:22.329 --> 00:21:24.569
Hey, William.

546
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:26.140
Look at me.

547
00:21:27.569 --> 00:21:32.510
(Making a silly face)

548
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.849
(Grinning)

549
00:21:38.849 --> 00:21:40.420
I really like you.

550
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.920
I like you. Oh, the animals?

551
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.319
(I want to go there.)

552
00:21:45.319 --> 00:21:46.460
You want to go there?

553
00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:51.690
(Let's go.)

554
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.430
Sam, take him.

555
00:21:57.329 --> 00:21:59.200
- Okay, okay. - We have a lot of time.

556
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.170
- Bleat. - Bleat?

557
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.680
You wanted to see the goats?

558
00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.950
(Did you want to see me?)

559
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.450
It's a big one. It must be a dad.

560
00:22:12.879 --> 00:22:15.190
- It's the daddy goat. - Daddy.

561
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.289
Say, "Hello, daddy goat."

562
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.260
That's the mommy.

563
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.420
Say, "Hello, mommy goat."

564
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.629
There's your friend. Hello, there.

565
00:22:26.629 --> 00:22:27.829
(Nice to meet you.)

566
00:22:27.829 --> 00:22:30.629
Sam, you look great with facial hair.

567
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.140
- Really? - You look foreign now.

568
00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.440
Now, you finally look Australian.

569
00:22:36.069 --> 00:22:38.440
Don't I resemble Russel Crowe a bit?

570
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.910
- Russel Crowe? - Yes.

571
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.049
Yes, when he gained a lot of weight.

572
00:22:42.849 --> 00:22:45.010
(Coughing)

573
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.920
- First, go change, Sam. - Okay.

574
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.220
This is for William. One each.

575
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.160
Gosh. He's so cute.

576
00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:54.190
Young master.

577
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.789
(Young Master Will has arrived.)

578
00:22:58.059 --> 00:23:01.160
Young Master Will stands in a picturesque scenery.

579
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.269
(He holds a portable fan in his hand.)

580
00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.640
Is he a doll or a human?

581
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.700
(Come here.)

582
00:23:08.769 --> 00:23:11.339
- We'll be going there. - He seems...

583
00:23:11.369 --> 00:23:14.609
like a noble dressed like this.

584
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.349
- I feel like a peasant. - Oh, stop it.

585
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.279
Young master.

586
00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:22.690
Young Master Will.

587
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.160
William, you're really cute today.

588
00:23:28.589 --> 00:23:30.029
Why are you so cute?

589
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:32.599
(Sam is infatuated with his little son.)

590
00:23:33.129 --> 00:23:36.430
- Correct posture. - Correct posture.

591
00:23:37.769 --> 00:23:39.000
Good.

592
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.569
Good.

593
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.010
- Sorry for being late. - Welcome in.

594
00:23:45.069 --> 00:23:47.010
Let's go inside. Hold on.

595
00:23:47.609 --> 00:23:49.879
- It's William. - William is here.

596
00:23:49.879 --> 00:23:50.980
William.

597
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.420
- William is here. - William.

598
00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.720
All right.

599
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.119
Hello, William.

600
00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.160
What's wrong? Come here.

601
00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.220
William.

602
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.460
(William begins to cry.)

603
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.490
Hello, William.

604
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.359
(The grandpa is so scary.)

605
00:24:06.359 --> 00:24:07.400
Say hello.

606
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.930
(The grandpa is so scary.)

607
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.069
What's wrong?

608
00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:12.069
(What's wrong, William?)

609
00:24:12.069 --> 00:24:14.869
William, I'll give you a present. Stop crying.

610
00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:17.970
Look at this dragonfly.

611
00:24:18.609 --> 00:24:20.779
- Look at this. - Is that real?

612
00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:21.839
Of course.

613
00:24:21.839 --> 00:24:24.150
Now here's a present for you, William.

614
00:24:25.349 --> 00:24:30.619
(He looks at the dragonfly and...)

615
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:33.660
(The scary grandpa)

616
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.490
Is this no good too?

617
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.400
Oh, no. Is this no good too?

618
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.170
Then, I'll give you this.

619
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:44.730
William, I'll give you this.

620
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.869
- This. - Want to see it?

621
00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:49.339
Watch this.

622
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.369
I'll give it to you.

623
00:24:51.369 --> 00:24:52.609
(He's interested in the fan.)

624
00:24:52.609 --> 00:24:54.279
- Thank him. - Say, "Thank you."

625
00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:56.180
- Thank you. - Here you go.

626
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.450
Thank you.

627
00:24:57.849 --> 00:25:00.650
- William, thank him. - Thank you.

628
00:25:01.849 --> 00:25:02.920
Take a look here.

629
00:25:03.019 --> 00:25:05.859
Shall we sing a song for William?

630
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.990
Yes.

631
00:25:07.859 --> 00:25:12.500
(It's a song to cheer William up.)

632
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.329
(Grinning)

633
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.970
(High note explosion)

634
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.049
(Let's go outside, Daddy.)

635
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.019
(Gosh, Master...)

636
00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:40.289
I guess he doesn't like that too.

637
00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:41.519
(William enters the school with tears.)

638
00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:43.059
Don't cry.

639
00:25:44.129 --> 00:25:45.299
Gosh.

640
00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:46.559
William.

641
00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:48.200
(I'm sorry.)

642
00:25:50.129 --> 00:25:51.430
(They exit in a hurry.)

643
00:25:51.629 --> 00:25:53.799
Cross your legs. Correct posture.

644
00:25:54.039 --> 00:25:56.109
- Correct posture. - Correct posture.

645
00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.440
Now I'm going to step out briefly.

646
00:26:01.109 --> 00:26:03.950
Class president. Keep an eye out...

647
00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.049
for those who fool around.

648
00:26:06.819 --> 00:26:08.420
Be on the lookout...

649
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.390
- responsibly, okay? - Yes, Master.

650
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.990
- All right? - Yes, Master.

651
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.260
Now quietly meditate. Close your eyes.

652
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.029
Close your eyes completely. Good.

653
00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:22.769
You have to stay put. I'll be back shortly.

654
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.769
(The Master steps outside.)

655
00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:28.769
The children remain in the classroom.

656
00:26:28.769 --> 00:26:30.140
(Serene)

657
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.980
Will the children be able to endure?

658
00:26:36.379 --> 00:26:39.049
Mischievous Seung Jae opens his eyes first.

659
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:40.980
(Seung Jae opens his eyes.)

660
00:26:41.849 --> 00:26:44.250
Tyrannosaurus.

661
00:26:44.619 --> 00:26:48.990
You'll be punished if you open your eyes.

662
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.230
You have to be quiet.

663
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.029
I have to go to the bathroom.

664
00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:58.299
I have to go poo.

665
00:26:58.670 --> 00:26:59.970
You have to push.

666
00:27:01.099 --> 00:27:02.210
(Soo A escapes the classroom first.)

667
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.539
The kids escape 1-by-1 due to potty emergencies.

668
00:27:05.579 --> 00:27:07.710
What can be done?

669
00:27:08.109 --> 00:27:09.480
I have to pee.

670
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.150
Which one is mine?

671
00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.450
That's mine.

672
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.150
(Now only the three of them remain.)

673
00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.789
Seo Eon and Si An remain inside.

674
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.019
And of course Seung Jae.

675
00:27:19.019 --> 00:27:20.490
(His eyes are full of mischief.)

676
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:23.559
(Rising)

677
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.200
(What are you doing Seung Jae?)

678
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.269
(He steals a bite of yakgwa.)

679
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.809
(The 2 of them are unaware.)

680
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:39.839
I have to go pee too.

681
00:27:42.579 --> 00:27:43.980
I have to go.

682
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.049
(Even Seo Eon has to go.)

683
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.819
Is it just the two of us?

684
00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:53.289
(Tip-toeing)

685
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.559
(He takes another bite.)

686
00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.730
(He couldn't see again.)

687
00:28:00.599 --> 00:28:04.529
(He happily crawls on all fours.)

688
00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.539
(Glaring)

689
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.410
(This cannot be.)

690
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.910
Hey, stay still. You have to stay put.

691
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:18.250
(Seung Jae has unlimited energy.)

692
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.220
Stop running around.

693
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.250
You're going to get in trouble.

694
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.019
(He ignores him.)

695
00:28:26.619 --> 00:28:28.359
Stay still.

696
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.190
(Turning away)

697
00:28:31.329 --> 00:28:32.829
(He's about to escape.)

698
00:28:32.829 --> 00:28:34.359
You have to stay put.

699
00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:38.500
You can't go out.

700
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.109
You're going to get in trouble.

701
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.109
Everyone leaves the classroom.

702
00:28:44.109 --> 00:28:46.879
Only studious Si An remains.

703
00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:49.849
How praiseworthy.

704
00:28:49.879 --> 00:28:52.279
This is the line.

705
00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:53.279
(What's going on here?)

706
00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.119
(Seo Jun is given the green light first.)

707
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:58.519
(It's Seol A's turn.)

708
00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:01.660
(He's anxious and restless.)

709
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.260
(His legs continue to squirm.)

710
00:29:06.629 --> 00:29:09.000
(I really need to go.)

711
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.440
Seol A, what's taking you so long?

712
00:29:13.569 --> 00:29:15.609
(He ends up fertilizing the soil...)

713
00:29:15.609 --> 00:29:18.109
(by peeing on the grass.)

714
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.510
(Seo Jun returns to the classroom.)

715
00:29:23.809 --> 00:29:25.279
Is it okay?

716
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.819
I am going to smell it.

717
00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:32.720
(A piece of yakgwa is half-eaten.)

718
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:35.019
Who ate this?

719
00:29:35.019 --> 00:29:37.160
(Who ate this?)

720
00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.500
It's you, right?

721
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.760
(I didn't eat it.)

722
00:29:42.869 --> 00:29:43.900
You.

723
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.869
(If Si An didn't do it, you must have done it.)

724
00:29:45.869 --> 00:29:47.000
It's you, right?

725
00:29:47.369 --> 00:29:49.170
(Yes.)

726
00:29:49.769 --> 00:29:51.940
(A piece of yakgwa is half-eaten.)

727
00:29:52.609 --> 00:29:55.180
(Seo Jun watches him.)

728
00:29:56.349 --> 00:29:58.279
(Approaching)

729
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.920
(Seung Jae picks up the untouched piece.)

730
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.789
Eat the one you started on.

731
00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.260
- I'm going to eat this. - No.

732
00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.490
You need to eat the one you started on.

733
00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.400
(He puts the rest in his mouth.)

734
00:30:14.859 --> 00:30:16.299
No.

735
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.410
(Shocked)

736
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:26.079
What are we going to do? He ate everything.

737
00:30:26.079 --> 00:30:27.879
(What are we going to do? He ate everything.)

738
00:30:27.879 --> 00:30:29.450
No more.

739
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.180
(He's trying to protect it with his whole body.)

740
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.150
(He is full of good cheer.)

741
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.190
He's a little prankster, like me.

742
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.190
(The little prankster, Seung Jae.)

743
00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.589
Sit down and close your eyes.

744
00:30:45.629 --> 00:30:46.900
- Like this? - No.

745
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.599
Do it while you are sitting down.

746
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.940
(He's out of control.)

747
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.000
Everyone, sit down.

748
00:30:55.839 --> 00:30:57.640
(Shocked)

749
00:30:59.079 --> 00:31:00.309
It's not him.

750
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:02.910
(Soo A returns to the classroom.)

751
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:04.710
Soo A, sit down.

752
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.619
Teacher might return.

753
00:31:06.619 --> 00:31:07.680
Close your eyes.

754
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.450
It's a secret that we went out.

755
00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.359
(He locks the door.)

756
00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:15.529
Sit down, and close your eyes.

757
00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:16.890
That's right.

758
00:31:17.529 --> 00:31:19.129
(Coughing)

759
00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.329
(Master is here.)

760
00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:26.339
(The scary Master appears.)

761
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.269
Wait a minute.

762
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.910
I heard children chattering.

763
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.450
Class president, who chattered?

764
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.549
Seung Jae did.

765
00:31:38.779 --> 00:31:40.450
I did.

766
00:31:40.619 --> 00:31:42.750
- Were you loud? - Yes.

767
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.119
If you chattered or moved around,

768
00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:48.829
be honest and raise your hand.

769
00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.990
(Thinking)

770
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:52.160
- Who else? - Me too.

771
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.599
- Did you chatter? - Yes.

772
00:31:53.799 --> 00:31:56.470
Seo Jun, be honest. Did you chatter?

773
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.470
- Yes. - Good job.

774
00:31:58.599 --> 00:32:00.569
Soo A. Who else?

775
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.339
- Who else? - I did too.

776
00:32:03.339 --> 00:32:05.140
Seol A, did you chatter?

777
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.740
(I did too.)

778
00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.740
Si An too.

779
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.549
What did you say to them when they chattered?

780
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:12.019
I did this.

781
00:32:12.019 --> 00:32:13.879
(I told them to stop like this)

782
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:17.089
- You said, "Stop it." - Yes.

783
00:32:17.089 --> 00:32:18.349
- Did you do that? - Yes.

784
00:32:18.349 --> 00:32:20.819
Class president is a bit at fault.

785
00:32:20.819 --> 00:32:23.129
However, he did the best.

786
00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.260
- The thing is, he... - Seung Jae.

787
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.329
He ate that.

788
00:32:28.329 --> 00:32:29.700
What did he eat?

789
00:32:30.069 --> 00:32:33.339
He picked up a piece and ate it.

790
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:35.539
Why did he eat it?

791
00:32:36.039 --> 00:32:38.140
- Did you eat it? - Yes.

792
00:32:38.339 --> 00:32:39.440
Why?

793
00:32:39.879 --> 00:32:42.250
I ate it because I was hungry.

794
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.180
You should have gotten my permission.

795
00:32:46.519 --> 00:32:48.079
It's not a laughing matter.

796
00:32:48.079 --> 00:32:49.150
(Nervous)

797
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.990
What did you do as the class president?

798
00:32:52.519 --> 00:32:54.319
I told him not to eat it.

799
00:32:54.319 --> 00:32:56.559
- He didn't listen to you. - No.

800
00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:58.460
- Seung Jae, is it true? - Yes.

801
00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.529
You neither listened to the class president...

802
00:33:01.529 --> 00:33:04.129
nor got a permission from me.

803
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.500
Kneel.

804
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.970
- Like this? - Yes, kneel.

805
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.309
Raise your arms.

806
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:12.539
(He raises his arms.)

807
00:33:13.339 --> 00:33:16.450
You need to ask, "May I eat this?"

808
00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:17.950
- Okay? - Okay.

809
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.849
Everyone, kneel.

810
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.650
- All of us? - Yes.

811
00:33:22.849 --> 00:33:24.250
Everyone, raise your arms.

812
00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.420
Kneel!

813
00:33:27.089 --> 00:33:28.359
Close your eyes.

814
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.589
Raise your arms high.

815
00:33:31.329 --> 00:33:33.900
Think about what you did wrong.

816
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.369
(Reflect upon yourself.)

817
00:33:35.369 --> 00:33:37.029
If you did something wrong,

818
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:38.539
should you reflect upon yourself?

819
00:33:38.539 --> 00:33:40.869
- No. - No?

820
00:33:42.339 --> 00:33:43.510
(What did you say?)

821
00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.680
- Yes. - Yes.

822
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.609
Should you do it again?

823
00:33:47.609 --> 00:33:48.750
- No. - No.

824
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.150
- You shouldn't, right? - Yes.

825
00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:52.879
Are you confident you won't do it again?

826
00:33:52.879 --> 00:33:54.180
- Yes. - Yes.

827
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.519
Put your arms down.

828
00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.390
- Attention. - Attention.

829
00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:04.289
- Thank you. - Thank you.

830
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.359
I want to hurry up and eat snacks.

831
00:34:08.359 --> 00:34:12.069
When I call your name, take one each.

832
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:15.310
Sit up straight and wait for permission...

833
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:18.209
to eat the snack, okay?

834
00:34:18.209 --> 00:34:19.310
- Yes. - Yes.

835
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.310
Seol A, come on up and take a snack.

836
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:25.680
(She grabs one.)

837
00:34:25.779 --> 00:34:30.419
Seo Jun, come on up and take a snack.

838
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:33.319
(He keeps his hands in front of him.)

839
00:34:33.689 --> 00:34:35.529
Soo A, come on up and take a snack.

840
00:34:35.529 --> 00:34:37.660
Put your hands together. There you go.

841
00:34:38.959 --> 00:34:40.560
(He only has eyes for yakgwa.)

842
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.100
Seung Jae, come on up and take a snack.

843
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.669
Seo Eon, come on up and take a snack.

844
00:34:46.939 --> 00:34:48.069
(He acquires yakgwa.)

845
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:49.240
There you go.

846
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:52.609
Si An, come on up and take a snack.

847
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.640
There isn't one.

848
00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.310
Really?

849
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.010
(The tray is empty.)

850
00:34:58.109 --> 00:35:01.450
(He picks up the tray and checks.)

851
00:35:02.049 --> 00:35:03.249
There isn't one?

852
00:35:03.649 --> 00:35:05.319
How strange!

853
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.229
Isn't it because Seung Jae ate one?

854
00:35:09.229 --> 00:35:10.930
- Seung Jae ate one. - Yes.

855
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.330
- That must be why. - I see.

856
00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:15.799
Si An didn't get a piece of yakgwa.

857
00:35:15.799 --> 00:35:17.499
What should you do?

858
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:20.439
We can buy more.

859
00:35:20.439 --> 00:35:21.870
Who will go and buy it?

860
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.510
Where will we buy it?

861
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.810
What should we do?

862
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.209
Si An didn't get a piece of yakgwa.

863
00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.810
(He hesitates for a second.)

864
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.979
(He breaks his piece of yakgwa...)

865
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.520
(and hands it to Si An.)

866
00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.950
Will you give him a piece of yours?

867
00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:40.520
This is too small.

868
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.819
Thank you.

869
00:35:41.819 --> 00:35:43.589
(Thank you anyway, my friend.)

870
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:45.260
They share the snack...

871
00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.499
by giving up a piece of their yakgwa.

872
00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.100
They are very kind.

873
00:35:50.799 --> 00:35:51.970
Good girl.

874
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.100
Seol A is a good girl.

875
00:35:54.499 --> 00:35:57.010
(The pieces make up a whole yakgwa.)

876
00:35:57.339 --> 00:36:00.310
- Thank you for the snack. - Thank you for the snack.

877
00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.950
(They will remember this sweetness longer...)

878
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.419
(because they had it together.)

879
00:36:07.819 --> 00:36:09.589
Don't fight.

880
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:12.120
Be a good person.

881
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.160
- Okay. - Okay.

882
00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.729
This is the end of the class.

883
00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:19.959
Did you do a good job?

884
00:36:19.959 --> 00:36:22.169
Did you do a good job?

885
00:36:22.169 --> 00:36:24.169
- Hello. - Hello.

886
00:36:24.169 --> 00:36:26.470
Does Seung Jae listen at home?

887
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:28.439
Yes.

888
00:36:28.439 --> 00:36:29.810
(Excuse me?)

889
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.080
- Father. - "Father".

890
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.580
Seung Jae, will you listen to me now?

891
00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:35.810
- Yes. - Really?

892
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:37.549
I can put them on by myself.

893
00:36:37.549 --> 00:36:38.620
Really?

894
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.120
Listen to your father.

895
00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.819
- Okay. - All right.

896
00:36:41.819 --> 00:36:44.749
I will video call Seol A and Soo A's dad.

897
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.419
(Dad, we miss you.)

898
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.529
(Amazing Volley Shooter)

899
00:36:49.529 --> 00:36:50.689
It's your dad.

900
00:36:50.689 --> 00:36:52.229
- It's your dad. - Dad.

901
00:36:52.229 --> 00:36:54.830
- Dad. - Dad.

902
00:36:54.999 --> 00:36:58.499
- It's my dad. - Everyone has gathered.

903
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.669
Si An was the class president today.

904
00:37:01.669 --> 00:37:03.439
He did a good job.

905
00:37:03.439 --> 00:37:05.109
Si An, show him what you learned earlier.

906
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:06.310
There you go.

907
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:07.709
(Hello, Father.)

908
00:37:07.709 --> 00:37:10.109
Give him a round of applause.

909
00:37:10.779 --> 00:37:13.620
Cheer for Dad and uncles.

910
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.189
South Korea.

911
00:37:15.189 --> 00:37:17.020
That's it. Get ready.

912
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.859
- South Korea. - South Korea.

913
00:37:20.859 --> 00:37:22.760
- South Korea. - South Korea.

914
00:37:23.459 --> 00:37:24.760
(Cheer up, Uncles.)

915
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.660
- South Korea. - South Korea.

916
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.359
(Even though he is away, he feels proud.)

917
00:37:28.359 --> 00:37:30.600
- Lee Dong Gook, let's go! - Let's go!

918
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.700
Let's go.

919
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.040
(They find the goat siblings.)

920
00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.169
What are they? They are cute, right?

921
00:37:38.169 --> 00:37:39.439
(Hello, I am William.)

922
00:37:40.439 --> 00:37:41.640
(Petting)

923
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.979
How pretty!

924
00:37:43.979 --> 00:37:48.080
(William loves the goats.)

925
00:37:49.749 --> 00:37:51.120
This is hilarious.

926
00:37:54.459 --> 00:37:57.459
What sound does a goat make?

927
00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:00.799
(He tries to imitate a goat.)

928
00:38:01.459 --> 00:38:02.830
(He takes off the hat.)

929
00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.029
You don't want to wear it.

930
00:38:04.029 --> 00:38:05.669
- Let's go. - "Let's go"?

931
00:38:05.669 --> 00:38:07.669
(Let's go.)

932
00:38:07.669 --> 00:38:09.140
Where are we going?

933
00:38:10.339 --> 00:38:12.040
Hey, William.

934
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.709
(Let's hurry up and go.)

935
00:38:13.709 --> 00:38:17.010
You have to go with me,

936
00:38:17.549 --> 00:38:19.450
but I don't feel like going yet.

937
00:38:20.049 --> 00:38:22.490
There are goats here.

938
00:38:23.549 --> 00:38:25.359
Hey, William.

939
00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.660
(Why do you keep calling me?)

940
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.890
Come here.

941
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:30.959
William.

942
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:32.999
Come here.

943
00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.629
William.

944
00:38:34.629 --> 00:38:35.999
(He is walking backwards.)

945
00:38:35.999 --> 00:38:41.870
(I will show you how fast I am.)

946
00:38:42.709 --> 00:38:46.010
I am coming to catch you.

947
00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.549
(William can't beat Sam even if he runs.)

948
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.279
(Someone is watching them.)

949
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:57.990
It's Lo Hee.

950
00:38:58.149 --> 00:38:59.689
Hello, Lo Hee.

951
00:38:59.919 --> 00:39:02.390
William, say hi to Lo Hee.

952
00:39:03.089 --> 00:39:05.399
Lo Hee, do you want to touch the goats?

953
00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.430
Have you tried touching the goats?

954
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.200
(Come here, Lo Hee.)

955
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.439
Come here.

956
00:39:13.399 --> 00:39:15.709
(It's nice to meet you, Lo Hee.)

957
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.270
Are they goats or puppies?

958
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.339
Where is your mom?

959
00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:24.049
Goats can't talk.

960
00:39:25.749 --> 00:39:28.080
- Lo Hee. - It's Lo Hee.

961
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:31.919
(Unlike William, who is happy to see her,)

962
00:39:31.919 --> 00:39:33.260
It's Lo Hee.

963
00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.189
(Lo Hee studies him carefully.)

964
00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:39.529
When William couldn't walk yet,

965
00:39:39.859 --> 00:39:42.229
Lo Hee looked after him...

966
00:39:42.229 --> 00:39:44.970
as if he were her own brother.

967
00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.439
(Lo Hee took good care of him.)

968
00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:50.609
(He couldn't even hold a banana.)

969
00:39:52.479 --> 00:39:54.979
You want to play with her, right?

970
00:39:58.209 --> 00:40:00.049
(Hesitant)

971
00:40:01.819 --> 00:40:02.990
Lo Hee, where are you going?

972
00:40:04.689 --> 00:40:07.490
William slowly approaches Lo Hee.

973
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.029
Does he remember her?

974
00:40:12.029 --> 00:40:14.399
(I am not used to seeing you walk.)

975
00:40:16.299 --> 00:40:22.370
(Lo Hee, I missed you.)

976
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.410
(You became even prettier.)

977
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.350
(Turning away)

978
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.649
What are you doing?

979
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:38.450
What are you doing?

980
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:40.060
Are you being hot and cold?

981
00:40:40.419 --> 00:40:42.260
That's foul play. You shouldn't do that.

982
00:40:43.189 --> 00:40:45.399
You shouldn't play hard to get.

983
00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:47.629
(I don't know my own heart.)

984
00:40:48.299 --> 00:40:50.799
Since it's fall, the air is cool.

985
00:40:50.799 --> 00:40:52.240
There is a bit of wind.

986
00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.240
Hello.

987
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.540
- Hello. - Hello.

988
00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.240
(They see a group of residents.)

989
00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.040
- It's a cultivator. - A cultivator.

990
00:41:00.839 --> 00:41:03.410
- Hello. - Hello.

991
00:41:03.979 --> 00:41:06.649
You look familiar.

992
00:41:06.649 --> 00:41:08.549
Hello.

993
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.950
(He stops the cultivator to say hello to them.)

994
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:12.390
Where are you going?

995
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.020
- I am going to the field. - I see.

996
00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.790
For how many years have you been married?

997
00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.129
55 years.

998
00:41:18.129 --> 00:41:19.529
55 years!

999
00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.129
I bet you haven't taken a lot of pictures lately.

1000
00:41:22.129 --> 00:41:23.700
- No, I haven't. - You may not have known,

1001
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.899
but he is one of the best photographers in Korea.

1002
00:41:27.169 --> 00:41:29.910
- He is very talented. - Take a picture of me.

1003
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:33.279
Please come on down.

1004
00:41:33.279 --> 00:41:35.140
Please wait.

1005
00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.850
This will be the backdrop.

1006
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:38.979
My goodness.

1007
00:41:38.979 --> 00:41:40.220
Let's put this...

1008
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.790
- over there. - Okay.

1009
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:45.319
(Please stick out your lips.)

1010
00:41:45.319 --> 00:41:46.620
Don't put lipstick on my lips.

1011
00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.990
It's red.

1012
00:41:48.959 --> 00:41:50.589
Any color is fine.

1013
00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:52.859
- This is better. - This color is better...

1014
00:41:52.859 --> 00:41:54.499
than red.

1015
00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:57.669
(The cherry-like lips are complete.)

1016
00:41:57.669 --> 00:41:59.799
Move back a little so that I can get...

1017
00:41:59.799 --> 00:42:01.200
a full shot of the cultivator.

1018
00:42:01.399 --> 00:42:02.709
Be affectionate to each other.

1019
00:42:02.709 --> 00:42:03.870
One,

1020
00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:06.180
2, 3.

1021
00:42:07.379 --> 00:42:08.479
Let's take another one.

1022
00:42:08.479 --> 00:42:09.649
(Please stand in a natural way.)

1023
00:42:09.649 --> 00:42:11.310
(They look a bit stiff.)

1024
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.450
Sir, did you have a love marriage...

1025
00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:14.950
- or an arranged marriage? - An arranged marriage.

1026
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.749
How many times did you meet?

1027
00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:18.319
We met more than 10 times.

1028
00:42:18.319 --> 00:42:20.020
That's rare for an arranged marriage.

1029
00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.990
During the time you met 10 times,

1030
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:23.189
did you kiss her or not?

1031
00:42:23.189 --> 00:42:24.189
I couldn't.

1032
00:42:25.089 --> 00:42:26.260
It's true love.

1033
00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.260
(This is embarrassing.)

1034
00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.100
This is good.

1035
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.770
Take a picture of them now.

1036
00:42:34.299 --> 00:42:37.010
It's the three dads' collaborate work.

1037
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.609
Thanks to Hwi Jae's effort,

1038
00:42:38.609 --> 00:42:41.609
the couple is smiling in the picture.

1039
00:42:41.609 --> 00:42:44.249
(It's one of the best pictures of their lives.)

1040
00:42:46.049 --> 00:42:47.279
They have been married for 55 years.

1041
00:42:47.279 --> 00:42:48.649
(They take a picture as a souvenir.)

1042
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.020
- Come on. - Stand in the middle.

1043
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.819
- Come on out. - Stand in the middle.

1044
00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.990
- Come on. - My goodness.

1045
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:57.660
Here we go. In 1, 2, 3.

1046
00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.560
Kimchi.

1047
00:43:00.129 --> 00:43:01.830
Pizza.

1048
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.770
- He will take it now. - Smile.

1049
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:07.799
Kimchi.

1050
00:43:07.799 --> 00:43:09.470
- How nice! - Kimchi.

1051
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:10.870
(Laughing)

1052
00:43:11.879 --> 00:43:14.580
She takes a picture with the cute puppies.

1053
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.950
The three dads captured the residents' memories.

1054
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:19.749
It's the children's turn.

1055
00:43:21.249 --> 00:43:23.089
This is the picture...

1056
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:25.890
dads and uncles took together.

1057
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.020
Please find this house...

1058
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.660
and deliver it to grandpa and grandma.

1059
00:43:30.959 --> 00:43:32.930
This grandma's name is...

1060
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.669
Im Sang Kyu.

1061
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.330
- Im Sang Kyu. - Im Sang Kyu.

1062
00:43:40.439 --> 00:43:43.569
They embark on a journey to find her.

1063
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:47.109
The two sets of twins cross the stone bridge...

1064
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:49.149
that is famous in Jincheon to enter the village.

1065
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.680
I think it will be over there.

1066
00:43:53.819 --> 00:43:55.450
Chili peppers.

1067
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.560
Look at these chili peppers.

1068
00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.720
- It looks the same. - Chili peppers.

1069
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.290
Let's eat chili peppers.

1070
00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.930
You will die if you eat them.

1071
00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:11.999
I think that blue house is the one in the picture.

1072
00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.569
That's right.

1073
00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.310
(What is the clue in the picture?)

1074
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:16.740
What is the clue in the picture?

1075
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:19.479
Find the house with a blue roof...

1076
00:44:19.479 --> 00:44:21.310
that can be seen behind them.

1077
00:44:22.049 --> 00:44:24.850
Isn't it the house over there?

1078
00:44:25.149 --> 00:44:26.950
- Come here. - It's a dragonfly.

1079
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:28.549
(He takes care of her.)

1080
00:44:28.819 --> 00:44:31.220
Shall we try catching a dragonfly?

1081
00:44:31.689 --> 00:44:34.319
Let's walk together.

1082
00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:35.729
(Soo A approaches first.)

1083
00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:41.029
(Seo Jun is shy next to Soo A.)

1084
00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:42.669
Seo Jun.

1085
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.470
I saw a blue house earlier.

1086
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.040
Let's go quickly.

1087
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.140
(Did Seo Eon find it already?)

1088
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:54.339
(Seo Eon runs confidently.)

1089
00:44:54.339 --> 00:44:57.010
This is the place.

1090
00:44:59.149 --> 00:45:01.549
Seo Eon, I don't think this is the place.

1091
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.990
(This obviously isn't the place.)

1092
00:45:04.249 --> 00:45:05.459
I was wrong.

1093
00:45:05.959 --> 00:45:07.720
Let's go.

1094
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.790
(Seo Eon runs without a plan.)

1095
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:09.959
Run.

1096
00:45:09.959 --> 00:45:11.689
Look for a blue house.

1097
00:45:11.689 --> 00:45:12.760
(Seo Eon, wait for me.)

1098
00:45:13.529 --> 00:45:15.200
(Thinking)

1099
00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:17.330
This isn't the place.

1100
00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:20.600
From where are these pretty children?

1101
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.669
Is this the place?

1102
00:45:22.839 --> 00:45:25.410
Are you Grandma Im?

1103
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.209
- Yes, I am. - My goodness.

1104
00:45:28.749 --> 00:45:30.910
(Did we find them?)

1105
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:34.549
Seo Jun, come here. Is this the place?

1106
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:37.520
- Are you Grandma Im? - Where is Grandpa?

1107
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.189
- He went to the field. - He went to the field.

1108
00:45:40.419 --> 00:45:43.029
Is this you?

1109
00:45:43.029 --> 00:45:44.029
Let me take a look.

1110
00:45:44.029 --> 00:45:46.430
It's the other Grandma Im.

1111
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:48.529
The one who plays table tennis.

1112
00:45:48.569 --> 00:45:50.330
You look different.

1113
00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:51.830
Let me take a look.

1114
00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:53.339
- She lives over there. - She lives over there.

1115
00:45:53.339 --> 00:45:54.569
It's that house.

1116
00:45:54.669 --> 00:45:56.540
All right. Let's go.

1117
00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.470
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1118
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:59.810
Thank you.

1119
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:01.680
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1120
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.549
(Do they know where they are going?)

1121
00:46:04.649 --> 00:46:07.149
(Which house was it?)

1122
00:46:07.749 --> 00:46:09.689
(They got lost again.)

1123
00:46:09.689 --> 00:46:12.290
Come here.

1124
00:46:12.819 --> 00:46:14.120
Come here.

1125
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.260
Come here.

1126
00:46:16.729 --> 00:46:18.160
(Seol A is funny.)

1127
00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.330
- Come here. - Come here.

1128
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.169
(Winking)

1129
00:46:23.899 --> 00:46:25.100
Let's go.

1130
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.240
We must find Grandma's house.

1131
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.970
Come here.

1132
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:32.080
Seo Jun goes in a different direction.

1133
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.879
Soo A follows him.

1134
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.080
(Seo Jun, wait for me.)

1135
00:46:43.049 --> 00:46:46.660
Is this the house they were looking for?

1136
00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.319
(Is this the house?)

1137
00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.299
(I see.)

1138
00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:57.169
Seo Jun sees the pavilion and the blue roof.

1139
00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.200
Wait a minute.

1140
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.640
It looks similar.

1141
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.770
That's the place.

1142
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:06.140
That's the place.

1143
00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.379
Grandma.

1144
00:47:08.709 --> 00:47:11.249
Grandma.

1145
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:15.249
I hear a princess' voice.

1146
00:47:15.249 --> 00:47:18.149
There is a prince too.

1147
00:47:19.859 --> 00:47:21.660
What pretty children!

1148
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.729
Grandpa and Grandma are here.

1149
00:47:24.959 --> 00:47:26.430
- I think it's them. - Are we the right ones?

1150
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:28.260
- Are we the right ones? - Yes.

1151
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.470
All right.

1152
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:33.370
They are wearing the same clothes.

1153
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:35.470
You are so nice.

1154
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:37.669
I think you are the ones in the picture.

1155
00:47:37.669 --> 00:47:38.740
All right.

1156
00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.540
(He gives them the framed picture.)

1157
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.810
Thank you.

1158
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:44.950
It's a gift from a prince.

1159
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.979
- Thank you. - My goodness.

1160
00:47:46.979 --> 00:47:50.020
Seo Eon, Seol A.

1161
00:47:50.749 --> 00:47:53.160
I found them.

1162
00:47:53.919 --> 00:47:55.660
(Are they on a date?)

1163
00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.160
Seo Jun is my younger brother.

1164
00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:59.729
- Really? - Yes.

1165
00:47:59.729 --> 00:48:01.799
He is a prankster.

1166
00:48:01.999 --> 00:48:04.600
Seo Eon, are you strong?

1167
00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.799
Yes, I am stronger than Dad.

1168
00:48:06.799 --> 00:48:08.910
I weigh 18.4kg.

1169
00:48:09.569 --> 00:48:11.939
Then you should play soccer.

1170
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.680
Is this the place?

1171
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.910
(Where are the others?)

1172
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:17.549
Seo Jun.

1173
00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:20.279
Soo A.

1174
00:48:20.279 --> 00:48:22.490
Soo A, Seo Jun.

1175
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:24.049
(What is it?)

1176
00:48:24.049 --> 00:48:26.720
I hear them. They must be over here.

1177
00:48:27.089 --> 00:48:28.729
Hello.

1178
00:48:28.729 --> 00:48:30.129
Thank you.

1179
00:48:30.129 --> 00:48:32.260
- Thank you. - Take this one.

1180
00:48:32.499 --> 00:48:35.200
- I want this one. - This one?

1181
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.299
Thank you.

1182
00:48:36.299 --> 00:48:38.430
- Thank you. - You are so nice.

1183
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:40.399
Wipe your hands on this later.

1184
00:48:40.399 --> 00:48:42.470
Here you go.

1185
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.010
It's tasty.

1186
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:46.640
(Staring)

1187
00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.850
I want honey.

1188
00:48:50.149 --> 00:48:52.549
(Try it.)

1189
00:48:54.749 --> 00:48:57.089
Do you want a bite?

1190
00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:59.560
(Soo A takes a bite too.)

1191
00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:01.930
It's coffee flavor.

1192
00:49:02.029 --> 00:49:03.790
It's coffee flavor.

1193
00:49:04.689 --> 00:49:06.700
(It's chestnut honey flavor.)

1194
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.100
What brings you to this village,

1195
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:11.299
princesses and princes?

1196
00:49:11.669 --> 00:49:13.040
We came here to give you the picture.

1197
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:14.999
You came here to give us the picture.

1198
00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:19.180
We took a class from a scary teacher.

1199
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.910
- It's about filial piety. - Filial piety?

1200
00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.379
- Stay healthy. - All right.

1201
00:49:24.709 --> 00:49:29.149
My goodness, thank you.

1202
00:49:29.149 --> 00:49:30.689
(Grandpa and Grandma, stay healthy.)

1203
00:49:30.689 --> 00:49:33.020
Grow up healthy.

1204
00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.689
- Okay. - How nice!

1205
00:49:34.859 --> 00:49:36.430
Bye.

1206
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:40.930
Seung Jae and Si An are together.

1207
00:49:41.229 --> 00:49:43.029
It's a flower.

1208
00:49:44.299 --> 00:49:45.540
It's a dragonfly.

1209
00:49:47.299 --> 00:49:49.109
(It's nice to meet you, children from the city.)

1210
00:49:49.839 --> 00:49:51.140
(He takes his eyes off of it.)

1211
00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.510
I will catch it. It flew away.

1212
00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.450
(Seeing a dragonfly fly makes them laugh.)

1213
00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:58.879
(Barking)

1214
00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:02.790
There are dogs.

1215
00:50:03.149 --> 00:50:05.560
Dogs, don't cry.

1216
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:07.990
(Barking)

1217
00:50:09.959 --> 00:50:12.160
You will get scolded.

1218
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:14.129
(Barking)

1219
00:50:14.129 --> 00:50:16.600
You will get scolded.

1220
00:50:17.129 --> 00:50:19.939
(He stomps his feet from afar.)

1221
00:50:19.939 --> 00:50:22.510
I am not a bad person.

1222
00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.870
(Whatever)

1223
00:50:26.279 --> 00:50:27.640
Let's take this way.

1224
00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.180
(The friendly boy doesn't give up.)

1225
00:50:29.709 --> 00:50:32.319
(The two friends hold hands.)

1226
00:50:32.319 --> 00:50:35.549
(Together, we are fearless.)

1227
00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:39.319
(Flinching)

1228
00:50:40.359 --> 00:50:42.060
Gosh, that surprised me.

1229
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.160
Gosh, that surprised me.

1230
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.660
Gosh, that surprised me.

1231
00:50:45.999 --> 00:50:48.700
(It's okay, Si An. You have me.)

1232
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.970
(I am scared.)

1233
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.140
Let's go.

1234
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.069
(Screaming)

1235
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:59.939
(They are a duo of scaredy-cat.)

1236
00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:03.879
(Don't come here.)

1237
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:06.549
(They are tired after a tense moment.)

1238
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:08.220
(They won't come after us, will they?)

1239
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.189
(They bump into each other.)

1240
00:51:11.189 --> 00:51:13.419
I am sorry.

1241
00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.890
I am going to go first.

1242
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.600
(I am going to go quickly.)

1243
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.499
(Wait for me.)

1244
00:51:22.499 --> 00:51:24.129
(What?)

1245
00:51:25.129 --> 00:51:27.770
The residents are harvesting sesame.

1246
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:30.669
They can't pass by such an interesting sight.

1247
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:32.779
What are you doing?

1248
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.510
(Staring)

1249
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.310
Is this...

1250
00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.520
you?

1251
00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.950
Is that me?

1252
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.819
You are wearing a purple top.

1253
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.589
Is that me?

1254
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:49.459
It's a present for you.

1255
00:51:49.459 --> 00:51:51.529
- You are good at this. - Is it a present for me?

1256
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.859
- Yes. - Why don't you try it?

1257
00:51:54.129 --> 00:51:55.999
Try it.

1258
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:59.770
- I am strong, right? - Yes, you are.

1259
00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:01.439
You are good at this.

1260
00:52:01.439 --> 00:52:02.910
You are good at this.

1261
00:52:03.169 --> 00:52:04.439
What is this?

1262
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:06.140
It's sesame.

1263
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:07.879
What's sesame?

1264
00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.010
You put sesame on side dishes.

1265
00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:13.520
We will give you a glass of water. Come.

1266
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:15.390
We will give you a glass of water.

1267
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:17.020
- How nice of you. - How nice of you.

1268
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:20.220
The moment he enters the community center,

1269
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.129
Si An takes the massage chair.

1270
00:52:23.129 --> 00:52:24.790
(Heave-ho)

1271
00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:31.729
(He turns on the massage chair.)

1272
00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:38.810
(He has tried it when he was younger.)

1273
00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.479
(My goodness)

1274
00:52:43.149 --> 00:52:46.520
(This is great.)

1275
00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.959
(This is it.)

1276
00:52:53.819 --> 00:52:55.990
- Does it feel good? - Yes.

1277
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:58.359
- Doesn't it hurt? - No.

1278
00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.029
It doesn't hurt. It feels good.

1279
00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:05.770
(My goodness)

1280
00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:09.540
It's not done yet.

1281
00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.680
(While the president enjoys a massage,)

1282
00:53:13.939 --> 00:53:15.709
(a dinosaur appears.)

1283
00:53:15.879 --> 00:53:17.249
How scary!

1284
00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:20.649
- What are you imitating? - Ankylosaurus.

1285
00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.149
- Ankylosaurus. - Ankylo?

1286
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.520
I have never heard of that.

1287
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.660
(Tyrannosaurus appears.)

1288
00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.890
What are you imitating?

1289
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:31.189
Tyrannosaurus.

1290
00:53:31.999 --> 00:53:33.399
(I don't know what it is, but he is cute.)

1291
00:53:34.729 --> 00:53:35.830
(Seung Jae is excited to receive a compliment.)

1292
00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:37.330
You are good.

1293
00:53:37.799 --> 00:53:39.700
What are you doing?

1294
00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.240
(I am a dinosaur that headbutts.)

1295
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:46.379
(Si An becomes Taekwon V.)

1296
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.080
(1 punch, 2 punches)

1297
00:53:48.979 --> 00:53:51.049
(It's a match.)

1298
00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:52.220
Don't hit him.

1299
00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:54.979
Is that how you do it?

1300
00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:57.149
Good job.

1301
00:53:57.749 --> 00:54:00.290
- Bye. - How cute!

1302
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:02.859
- Bye. - How cute!

1303
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:05.899
Where is this grandma?

1304
00:54:05.899 --> 00:54:07.999
If you go this way,

1305
00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:10.930
you will find a house with a pole.

1306
00:54:10.999 --> 00:54:14.870
That's her house. Bring it to her.

1307
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:18.209
Please take this pumpkin...

1308
00:54:18.209 --> 00:54:20.310
- to her. - Okay.

1309
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:21.510
There you go.

1310
00:54:22.049 --> 00:54:23.350
It's heavy.

1311
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:24.680
(Screaming)

1312
00:54:26.649 --> 00:54:29.049
Is it a baby pumpkin?

1313
00:54:29.189 --> 00:54:30.689
It's an old pumpkin.

1314
00:54:30.749 --> 00:54:32.189
A grandma pumpkin?

1315
00:54:32.189 --> 00:54:34.020
Yes, it's a grandma pumpkin.

1316
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.560
Hold it together.

1317
00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.830
- Hold it together. - I will hold it.

1318
00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:41.129
(He uses his facial muscles.)

1319
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.899
(Surge, my power.)

1320
00:54:44.169 --> 00:54:46.240
Let's go and find this grandma.

1321
00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.339
(Grandma, come with me.)

1322
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.870
Bye, Grandma.

1323
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:53.479
Bye, Grandma.

1324
00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:55.450
Bye.

1325
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:56.850
I can do this.

1326
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.919
Si An, is it heavy?

1327
00:55:00.919 --> 00:55:02.990
(Si An, is it heavy?)

1328
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:04.020
No.

1329
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.419
Do you want to carry it together?

1330
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.160
I am strong.

1331
00:55:10.229 --> 00:55:11.330
Let's go.

1332
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.930
Gather your strength, my friend.

1333
00:55:16.029 --> 00:55:17.100
Okay.

1334
00:55:17.899 --> 00:55:20.399
(A man can't take back his words.)

1335
00:55:20.399 --> 00:55:21.839
(Struggling)

1336
00:55:21.839 --> 00:55:23.939
Gather your strength, my friend.

1337
00:55:24.209 --> 00:55:26.240
(Clueless)

1338
00:55:26.709 --> 00:55:28.240
(Struggling)

1339
00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:31.379
(Swaying)

1340
00:55:31.749 --> 00:55:33.049
It's heavy.

1341
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.450
(Finally)

1342
00:55:34.479 --> 00:55:37.189
Is it heavy? Shall we carry it together?

1343
00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:39.459
Carry this.

1344
00:55:40.689 --> 00:55:41.959
Carry this.

1345
00:55:41.959 --> 00:55:43.589
Carry this.

1346
00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:46.629
- Thank you. - It's heavy.

1347
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.569
(He gives up right away.)

1348
00:55:49.569 --> 00:55:51.970
I can't carry it.

1349
00:55:51.999 --> 00:55:53.140
Give me this one.

1350
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:56.939
What should we do?

1351
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:58.740
What should we do?

1352
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:00.839
(I have an idea.)

1353
00:56:03.649 --> 00:56:05.279
I put it on its side.

1354
00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:10.049
Let's go and find this grandma.

1355
00:56:10.649 --> 00:56:14.120
(It's great that Si An didn't give up.)

1356
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:17.990
(When he can't roll it very well...)

1357
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:19.260
I can do this.

1358
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.200
Gather your strength.

1359
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:25.439
I will do it now.

1360
00:56:27.569 --> 00:56:30.339
Roll it carefully.

1361
00:56:30.709 --> 00:56:35.709
(He rolls the pumpkin carefully.)

1362
00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:40.450
It's heavy. It's heavy.

1363
00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.390
(Thankful)

1364
00:56:43.649 --> 00:56:44.720
What is this?

1365
00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.419
A grandma pumpkin.

1366
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:49.390
- A pumpkin. - We have your picture.

1367
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:50.990
Is that you?

1368
00:56:51.189 --> 00:56:53.299
- It's me. - It's a present for you.

1369
00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.899
(It's a present for you.)

1370
00:56:54.899 --> 00:56:56.499
Thank you.

1371
00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.970
What were you doing?

1372
00:56:59.169 --> 00:57:00.569
I was plowing the field.

1373
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.669
- Shield? - Field.

1374
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:04.540
- Yield? - Field.

1375
00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:05.779
Fear?

1376
00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.209
(Si An and Seung Jae complete their task.)

1377
00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.819
Where is William?

1378
00:57:17.149 --> 00:57:20.390
William, we are here to deliver snacks.

1379
00:57:20.859 --> 00:57:23.430
The residents are very busy these days.

1380
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:25.799
(William will deliver snacks.)

1381
00:57:25.799 --> 00:57:27.859
We need to find them.

1382
00:57:28.499 --> 00:57:30.970
I heard that they have a cultivator. Where is it?

1383
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:35.540
(Dad, look over there.)

1384
00:57:36.939 --> 00:57:41.010
That's right. They are working hard.

1385
00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:43.879
Hello. Hello.

1386
00:57:43.879 --> 00:57:44.950
Hello.

1387
00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:46.950
- Hello. - Hello.

1388
00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:48.950
My goodness, thank you.

1389
00:57:49.319 --> 00:57:51.049
How cute!

1390
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:52.689
Whose baby is this?

1391
00:57:52.919 --> 00:57:53.990
He is my baby.

1392
00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.560
- Are you this person? - Yes, I am.

1393
00:57:56.629 --> 00:57:58.430
You are wearing the same outfit.

1394
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:01.200
- Was it taken today? - Earlier today.

1395
00:58:02.529 --> 00:58:03.830
Give it to him.

1396
00:58:03.899 --> 00:58:05.569
- Give it to him. - Thank you.

1397
00:58:05.899 --> 00:58:08.270
It's a great picture.

1398
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:11.339
- Thank you. - This is amazing.

1399
00:58:11.569 --> 00:58:13.439
Everyone, gather around.

1400
00:58:13.879 --> 00:58:15.040
Here you go.

1401
00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:22.549
- William. - This is tasty.

1402
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:24.089
William, he says it's tasty.

1403
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:26.919
- It's a success. - Good boy. He eats well.

1404
00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:28.790
He eats very well.

1405
00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.060
Won't the chili pepper be too spicy?

1406
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.930
(Oh, my goodness)

1407
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:38.899
(My goodness)

1408
00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:44.510
Which chili pepper are you growing?

1409
00:58:46.339 --> 00:58:48.279
- Cheongyang chili pepper? - We have that.

1410
00:58:48.279 --> 00:58:49.810
It's a spicy chili pepper.

1411
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:51.609
(Dad, are you okay?)

1412
00:58:51.979 --> 00:58:53.819
Kimchi is tasty too.

1413
00:58:53.819 --> 00:58:57.319
Where did you get this outfit?

1414
00:58:57.749 --> 00:59:00.819
He dressed up as the thing that keeps the birds away.

1415
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:04.060
- A scarecrow. - That's right.

1416
00:59:04.229 --> 00:59:06.859
I see. That's quite a unique outfit.

1417
00:59:06.859 --> 00:59:08.600
But he looks cute in it.

1418
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.700
- We don't want any birds. - Goodness.

1419
00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:12.569
I see. That's very cute.

1420
00:59:12.569 --> 00:59:13.939
(Don't come, sparrows.)

1421
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.339
We don't have babies in rural areas like here.

1422
00:59:17.339 --> 00:59:20.410
So I'm so thankful that you came to our area.

1423
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.279
The last time we heard a baby cry was...

1424
00:59:24.279 --> 00:59:27.950
about 14 or 15 years ago.

1425
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:29.049
I'm serious.

1426
00:59:29.049 --> 00:59:30.350
- Really? - Yes.

1427
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:32.390
So what brings you here?

1428
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:35.959
We came here to learn how to behave with manners.

1429
00:59:35.959 --> 00:59:38.700
But this guy is so scared of the Master.

1430
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:40.899
So he couldn't study today.

1431
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:43.700
- He's a bad student. - Is he?

1432
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.100
(I'm just going to eat some corns.)

1433
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.370
(What?)

1434
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:51.569
(This man picks the corns and eats.)

1435
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.709
(Let me try that too.)

1436
00:59:57.979 --> 00:59:59.779
- He's picking the corns. - Excuse me?

1437
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.390
I think he must be copying me.

1438
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.390
He loves copying people.

1439
01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:12.399
(This is useful. I must learn stuff like this.)

1440
01:00:12.399 --> 01:00:15.299
William, Daddy has to eat some food too.

1441
01:00:15.299 --> 01:00:18.169
I want you to shoo away the birds.

1442
01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:20.169
Chirp, please.

1443
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.040
(Chirping)

1444
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:25.410
(Sparrows, step back!)

1445
01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:27.510
(I'm on my way!)

1446
01:00:27.879 --> 01:00:29.680
(He chirps in a low-pitched voice.)

1447
01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:33.419
(What is he doing?)

1448
01:00:34.649 --> 01:00:37.689
(William the scarecrow is feeling defiant.)

1449
01:00:37.689 --> 01:00:39.990
(But how far are you going to go?)

1450
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.229
(Who are you?)

1451
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:46.560
William, do you want to ride that?

1452
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:48.399
(Yes!)

1453
01:00:48.399 --> 01:00:50.229
- He wants to ride it? - You want to?

1454
01:00:50.229 --> 01:00:52.439
Shall we ask the gentleman to give us a ride?

1455
01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.600
Ask him for a ride.

1456
01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.240
It'd be my pleasure. I'll give you a ride.

1457
01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.640
- Please give us a ride. - Sure. I'd love to.

1458
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:03.149
(The engine starts.)

1459
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:06.149
- We're going. - Vroom.

1460
01:01:06.149 --> 01:01:07.720
(I haven't been on a ride like this before.)

1461
01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.189
There are spiders here.

1462
01:01:11.149 --> 01:01:12.660
(Hello, spider.)

1463
01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.359
Those are potatoes.

1464
01:01:14.359 --> 01:01:17.060
I see. Aren't those corns?

1465
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.760
Right. This is for corns.

1466
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:21.629
The corns we had earlier.

1467
01:01:22.899 --> 01:01:24.100
Say hi.

1468
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.040
- William. - What's that sound?

1469
01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.240
William.

1470
01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:31.069
(Now that we look back, today,)

1471
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:33.979
(even Hwi Jae mispronounced his name.)

1472
01:01:33.979 --> 01:01:35.649
(And that includes his Master as well.)

1473
01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:38.350
William, isn't this nice?

1474
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:40.879
(This is great!)

1475
01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:43.220
Isn't this fun?

1476
01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.890
Hello, everyone.

1477
01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:47.319
(Now, you can call me "Williom".)

1478
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:50.660
But sir, where is everyone?

1479
01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.600
Everyone is at the center.

1480
01:01:53.729 --> 01:01:55.229
At the same time in the center,

1481
01:01:55.229 --> 01:01:57.069
everyone's partaking in a dance party.

1482
01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.470
- Hello. - Hi.

1483
01:02:00.399 --> 01:02:02.410
(William is perplexed.)

1484
01:02:03.209 --> 01:02:05.810
(A dance party with senior citizens above 70)

1485
01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:09.109
(Smiling)

1486
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:11.680
(Everyone, let's turn it up!)

1487
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.319
(Age is just a number when it's about having fun.)

1488
01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:16.490
(Right on!)

1489
01:02:16.919 --> 01:02:20.120
(Say goodbye to your sadness with William.)

1490
01:02:22.089 --> 01:02:24.330
(William, this cutie, is essential at parties.)

1491
01:02:26.999 --> 01:02:29.600
(Just follow my lead.)

1492
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.439
(I'll let you get back your lost excitement.)

1493
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:36.669
(Dance with William.)

1494
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:41.240
- He's done well. - Give him a hand please.

1495
01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.979
- Give him a hand. - Give him a hand.

1496
01:02:42.979 --> 01:02:44.609
(Clapping zealously)

1497
01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.450
- Come here, William. - Go to her.

1498
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:51.189
- Come to me. - Go ahead.

1499
01:02:51.189 --> 01:02:52.319
(Smiling)

1500
01:02:55.459 --> 01:02:57.589
He plays hard-to-get a lot.

1501
01:02:57.589 --> 01:03:00.229
- That makes it more fun. - He's handsome enough.

1502
01:03:00.529 --> 01:03:02.899
- Is he a boy? - Yes.

1503
01:03:02.899 --> 01:03:04.229
It's a boy.

1504
01:03:04.999 --> 01:03:06.839
(His beauty is good enough to fool them.)

1505
01:03:06.839 --> 01:03:08.569
We don't have anything for the baby.

1506
01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:11.270
- It's pumpkin porridge. - Oh, thank you.

1507
01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:14.180
Do you want some of this?

1508
01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.379
William, do you want some porridge?

1509
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:17.910
(He opens his mouth.)

1510
01:03:21.279 --> 01:03:22.490
This is tasty.

1511
01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:25.720
Goodness, you can eat.

1512
01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:27.660
I didn't know you were an eater.

1513
01:03:27.859 --> 01:03:29.459
Eat up. Open your mouth.

1514
01:03:29.629 --> 01:03:31.189
Look at you. Good job.

1515
01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:33.060
You can eat.

1516
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.600
(Give it to me. I can't wait to eat this up.)

1517
01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.939
Goodness. You're thanking us?

1518
01:03:40.499 --> 01:03:41.910
(What a good boy.)

1519
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:43.240
You're so sweet.

1520
01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.540
You have to say thank you.

1521
01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.040
Thank you for the pumpkin porridge.

1522
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:50.979
- He really likes it. - Your boy is...

1523
01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.249
- Say bye. - Bye, bye.

1524
01:03:55.249 --> 01:03:56.589
- Say goodbye. - Bye.

1525
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:58.419
- Bye. - What a good boy.

1526
01:03:58.419 --> 01:03:59.660
- Thank you. - Goodness.

1527
01:04:00.319 --> 01:04:02.160
Aren't you so kind?

1528
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:05.760
In no time, it becomes night.

1529
01:04:05.959 --> 01:04:09.669
- We are a quartet. - We are a quartet.

1530
01:04:10.299 --> 01:04:12.999
(These 4 are coming back from their errand.)

1531
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.910
Hey, you guys.

1532
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:18.740
- Welcome back. - Did you do your errand?

1533
01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.680
Give me a high-five. Well done.

1534
01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.049
Did the senior citizens say you did well?

1535
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:25.049
Yes!

1536
01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.249
Dad!

1537
01:04:27.779 --> 01:04:29.220
(The younger ones come back with Sam.)

1538
01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.149
- Great job. - You're back.

1539
01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.589
Si An, come here.

1540
01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.390
- What was that? - Si An!

1541
01:04:37.529 --> 01:04:39.100
(A tearful encounter of siblings)

1542
01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.200
Si An.

1543
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.830
- Seung Jae, you're back. - Yes.

1544
01:04:42.399 --> 01:04:44.129
- Did you do a good job? - I did.

1545
01:04:44.729 --> 01:04:47.770
(Gosh, isn't anyone going to welcome me?)

1546
01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:50.540
(William, you're back.)

1547
01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.680
You only have two teeth.

1548
01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.649
(She made me happy.)

1549
01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:02.419
Seung Jae, play with me.

1550
01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:04.620
(Better hide yourself well)

1551
01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.890
(Or I'll see you hair)

1552
01:05:07.189 --> 01:05:10.830
Are you done hiding? I want to play this game.

1553
01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:13.859
I'll hide then.

1554
01:05:13.859 --> 01:05:14.899
Okay.

1555
01:05:14.899 --> 01:05:15.970
(Si An is the tagger.)

1556
01:05:19.799 --> 01:05:22.410
(The tagger has hidden himself as well.)

1557
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:26.410
(Hide-and-seek without a tagger)

1558
01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.049
- Did you find everyone? - No.

1559
01:05:31.049 --> 01:05:32.319
I'm done.

1560
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.779
- Okay. - Why are you so loud?

1561
01:05:34.779 --> 01:05:36.120
(Startled)

1562
01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.089
Hey, hide!

1563
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:40.120
Si An, come and hide here.

1564
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.490
You have to hide here with me,

1565
01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.890
- so he can't find us. - Let's do that.

1566
01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.629
This should be enough.

1567
01:05:49.229 --> 01:05:52.069
(The Master became the tagger.)

1568
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.510
(These two friends are getting along well.)

1569
01:06:00.339 --> 01:06:03.010
Let's run!

1570
01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:05.379
(This is so much fun.)

1571
01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.819
Seung Jae.

1572
01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:12.089
Do you go to school with my sisters?

1573
01:06:12.089 --> 01:06:15.629
- Yes. - I'm in Class Elephant.

1574
01:06:15.629 --> 01:06:18.600
What about you?

1575
01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.160
I'm in Class Washington.

1576
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.600
- What? - Class Washington.

1577
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.899
- Class Washington? - That's right.

1578
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.740
Let's play jegi.

1579
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:32.779
Let's see who can throw it farther.

1580
01:06:33.339 --> 01:06:34.510
Yes!

1581
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:37.410
(You're good.)

1582
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.180
Yes!

1583
01:06:42.689 --> 01:06:44.749
(I'll do it if you do it.)

1584
01:06:44.919 --> 01:06:47.990
I want to do something cool.

1585
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:52.760
Seung Jae, do you know how to do taekwondo?

1586
01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.160
Do you know Taekwondo?

1587
01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.430
Taekwondo!

1588
01:06:56.499 --> 01:06:58.499
(He slips.)

1589
01:06:58.799 --> 01:07:00.040
You're bad at it.

1590
01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:01.870
Taekwondo!

1591
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:03.640
(This is how you do Taekwondo.)

1592
01:07:04.669 --> 01:07:05.879
Just like this.

1593
01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:09.549
Do you know how to kick a soccer ball?

1594
01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:11.010
No.

1595
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:14.049
I can kick a soccer ball.

1596
01:07:15.189 --> 01:07:16.720
I can do it.

1597
01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.790
I can teach you how to kick the ball.

1598
01:07:22.359 --> 01:07:24.359
Just like this?

1599
01:07:24.359 --> 01:07:25.459
No.

1600
01:07:25.899 --> 01:07:27.060
(He teaches Seung Jae passionately.)

1601
01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.600
- This is how you do it. - You're so good.

1602
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:32.200
(Here comes the soccer player, Si An.)

1603
01:07:37.439 --> 01:07:38.580
Goodness.

1604
01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:40.510
Are you okay?

1605
01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:42.149
Come here.

1606
01:07:42.149 --> 01:07:44.010
Hey, come out here.

1607
01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:49.120
(Kids are drawing on the ground outside.)

1608
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:54.459
Si An. Seung Jae.

1609
01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:56.490
- Yes? - What were you doing?

1610
01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.859
- We were drawing. - We were drawing.

1611
01:07:59.399 --> 01:08:01.600
Seung Jae, come here.

1612
01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.470
I love you, grandpa.

1613
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:06.740
Grandpa?

1614
01:08:07.569 --> 01:08:10.240
- I love you. - Oh, no. What will I do?

1615
01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:11.609
I love you.

1616
01:08:11.609 --> 01:08:13.379
Say, "I love you, Master."

1617
01:08:13.379 --> 01:08:15.480
- I love you, Master. - I love you, Master.

1618
01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:19.280
All right. You must help me.

1619
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.150
Will you listen to me or not?

1620
01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:23.089
- I will. - I will. Attention.

1621
01:08:23.089 --> 01:08:24.489
- Attention. - That's right.

1622
01:08:24.489 --> 01:08:26.489
You remember what we studied together?

1623
01:08:26.489 --> 01:08:29.760
When you go inside, there is...

1624
01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.629
a crock. I put it in there.

1625
01:08:32.629 --> 01:08:34.199
That's a very precious crock.

1626
01:08:34.199 --> 01:08:36.100
I want you...

1627
01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:39.400
to fill the crock with popped rice. Got it?

1628
01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.440
Yes, sir.

1629
01:08:41.869 --> 01:08:43.369
- Can you do this? - Yes, sir.

1630
01:08:43.369 --> 01:08:46.310
Go. Go to that room. Go to that side.

1631
01:08:46.739 --> 01:08:48.709
- Do a good job. - Yes, sir!

1632
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:50.409
Gosh, good boys.

1633
01:08:50.409 --> 01:08:52.350
Why did you call us that?

1634
01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:53.980
You're such nice boys.

1635
01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.350
There you go.

1636
01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:56.489
(Si An and Seung Jae enter.)

1637
01:08:57.449 --> 01:08:59.520
Let's put it in this.

1638
01:09:00.419 --> 01:09:04.060
(They first check the crock.)

1639
01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.230
Let's put it in here.

1640
01:09:06.459 --> 01:09:08.499
There. With this.

1641
01:09:08.499 --> 01:09:10.669
Hey, look at this.

1642
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:11.829
(I'll help you.)

1643
01:09:13.299 --> 01:09:14.339
What?

1644
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:18.909
Gosh, did it break?

1645
01:09:18.909 --> 01:09:22.409
(The precious crock is broken!)

1646
01:09:23.549 --> 01:09:25.350
It fell.

1647
01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:26.919
(This styrofoam crock was specially made.)

1648
01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.989
It wasn't a simple errand.

1649
01:09:29.989 --> 01:09:32.190
It was the Master's idea.

1650
01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:35.930
It's to build their problem solving skills.

1651
01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.390
When the kids face a problem,

1652
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:41.600
I want them to solve it while helping each other.

1653
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.299
I wanted to create an opportunity to train.

1654
01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.739
What?

1655
01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:51.110
Why did it fall?

1656
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:52.280
This...

1657
01:09:52.539 --> 01:09:53.839
(What is this?)

1658
01:09:53.839 --> 01:09:55.079
No...

1659
01:09:56.249 --> 01:09:58.879
(Seung Jae is putting the broken piece away.)

1660
01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.220
(They have no idea the crock is broken.)

1661
01:10:04.919 --> 01:10:09.360
(They're filling snacks in the broken crock.)

1662
01:10:10.959 --> 01:10:13.030
It's so fun!

1663
01:10:13.959 --> 01:10:16.869
(However, it's no use.)

1664
01:10:16.869 --> 01:10:18.900
(It's a waste of time.)

1665
01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:25.940
Why is it leaking?

1666
01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.980
(Si An finally noticed that something is wrong.)

1667
01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:32.220
It must be like that because of a hole.

1668
01:10:35.619 --> 01:10:39.320
(Is it leaking through that hole?)

1669
01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.320
(Ta-da)

1670
01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.629
There is a hole. What do we do?

1671
01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.699
I'll try to close the hole.

1672
01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:52.199
Where is it? Is it here?

1673
01:10:53.239 --> 01:10:56.539
(It's not easy to cover the hole.)

1674
01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.339
I think it...

1675
01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:02.249
It was ripped. What do we do?

1676
01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.010
It ripped.

1677
01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:07.379
We have to clean up.

1678
01:11:07.379 --> 01:11:10.549
The Master will yell at us.

1679
01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:11.820
Okay.

1680
01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:13.760
Hurry. Hurry up.

1681
01:11:14.089 --> 01:11:16.030
(Si An feels anxious.)

1682
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:17.659
We have to hurry.

1683
01:11:19.499 --> 01:11:21.430
(What is Seung Jae doing?)

1684
01:11:23.199 --> 01:11:26.039
(Eating)

1685
01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:29.039
Are you eating it?

1686
01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:32.010
Yes. It's delicious.

1687
01:11:32.909 --> 01:11:34.940
We have to hurry.

1688
01:11:35.039 --> 01:11:38.749
(He's too busy stuffing his face.)

1689
01:11:38.749 --> 01:11:40.350
Don't eat!

1690
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.049
Let's hurry up and clean.

1691
01:11:43.619 --> 01:11:46.589
The Master will be mad.

1692
01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.459
Okay.

1693
01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:51.629
(Is it that good?)

1694
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:53.199
(After having a taste,)

1695
01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.770
(he's having a fist full.)

1696
01:11:58.230 --> 01:11:59.799
We have to hurry.

1697
01:12:01.239 --> 01:12:04.110
I'll cover the hole.

1698
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:05.339
Okay.

1699
01:12:06.339 --> 01:12:10.350
(Si An is trying to cover the hole.)

1700
01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.980
My hands are too small.

1701
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:17.289
My hands are small. What do I do?

1702
01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.720
I got it.

1703
01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:23.930
(He's using the bowl.)

1704
01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.299
(If you're a human, you should use tools.)

1705
01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:26.400
I got it.

1706
01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.169
I'm covering it.

1707
01:12:29.629 --> 01:12:32.570
(Stop eating, my friend.)

1708
01:12:32.999 --> 01:12:34.640
You dropped some.

1709
01:12:36.039 --> 01:12:37.940
It's on your mouth.

1710
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:40.680
(They're so sweet to each other.)

1711
01:12:41.739 --> 01:12:42.780
(Shall we solve this?)

1712
01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:45.049
Seung Jae, hurry.

1713
01:12:45.079 --> 01:12:47.320
I'll do this too.

1714
01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:49.249
They might be shocked,

1715
01:12:49.249 --> 01:12:52.220
but they are trying to solve it together.

1716
01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.020
I'm proud of them.

1717
01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:55.060
(However, the bowl isn't helping.)

1718
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:59.560
Hold on.

1719
01:13:00.129 --> 01:13:03.030
(Si An thought of something else.)

1720
01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:05.400
Bottoms?

1721
01:13:06.499 --> 01:13:07.900
Like this?

1722
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.039
(Toad Si An is blocking the crock.)

1723
01:13:10.039 --> 01:13:11.440
I covered it.

1724
01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.180
I'm covering it with my bottoms.

1725
01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:18.579
Hurry up. Hurry.

1726
01:13:18.579 --> 01:13:20.350
I can't.

1727
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.249
Bottoms...

1728
01:13:22.249 --> 01:13:23.289
(Is it not working?)

1729
01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:27.060
(I didn't want to go this far...)

1730
01:13:27.419 --> 01:13:28.489
(Struggling)

1731
01:13:28.489 --> 01:13:31.159
Gosh, is he covering it with his whole body?

1732
01:13:31.159 --> 01:13:33.499
(What is going on?)

1733
01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.669
I'm covering it.

1734
01:13:37.169 --> 01:13:41.070
(He's trying to cover it by throwing himself.)

1735
01:13:42.339 --> 01:13:44.409
(Seung Jae is rushing out.)

1736
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:50.850
Master! Master!

1737
01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:51.980
Yes?

1738
01:13:52.449 --> 01:13:54.650
- Master. - Yes?

1739
01:13:54.650 --> 01:13:56.390
- By the way... - Yes?

1740
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:58.560
There is a hole.

1741
01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.690
There was suddenly a hole.

1742
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.089
You suddenly got a hole?

1743
01:14:02.089 --> 01:14:04.989
Yes! Si An stopped it!

1744
01:14:05.329 --> 01:14:07.959
Master, please hurry.

1745
01:14:07.959 --> 01:14:10.270
It's hard.

1746
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:13.039
Please come. Si An stopped it.

1747
01:14:14.699 --> 01:14:17.339
Look at this. Everything leaked.

1748
01:14:18.409 --> 01:14:19.810
It leaked.

1749
01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:21.010
(Please help me.)

1750
01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:23.409
Why are you on the floor, Si An?

1751
01:14:24.079 --> 01:14:26.020
Are you covering the hole?

1752
01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.020
Yes.

1753
01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.820
- To stop it from leaking? - Yes.

1754
01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.720
What should we do?

1755
01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.919
Seung Jae, did you help him?

1756
01:14:33.989 --> 01:14:36.260
No. I ate this.

1757
01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.690
Did you only eat?

1758
01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:38.699
Yes.

1759
01:14:38.699 --> 01:14:41.060
(You rascal...)

1760
01:14:42.570 --> 01:14:44.999
No, he helped me.

1761
01:14:44.999 --> 01:14:47.699
Seung Jae helped me.

1762
01:14:47.699 --> 01:14:50.470
(They're so loyal to each other.)

1763
01:14:50.869 --> 01:14:52.339
- I helped. - Did you?

1764
01:14:52.339 --> 01:14:54.239
- Yes. - How did you help?

1765
01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.810
Me? I helped once.

1766
01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:58.010
Did you help him?

1767
01:14:58.010 --> 01:14:59.020
Yes.

1768
01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:00.520
Great job.

1769
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.249
Let's see. Move back. Good job.

1770
01:15:03.419 --> 01:15:04.789
You can let go.

1771
01:15:05.659 --> 01:15:08.159
Gosh, it's broken.

1772
01:15:08.159 --> 01:15:12.030
I tried to cover it with my bottoms.

1773
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:13.060
It didn't stick.

1774
01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.100
It didn't work?

1775
01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:16.470
Seung Jae and Si An, come here.

1776
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:17.530
- Okay. - Why?

1777
01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:19.140
- From now... - Are we being punished?

1778
01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.169
No, you're not.

1779
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:22.770
You don't get punished every day.

1780
01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:25.480
Good job working together.

1781
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.039
Hug each other to say great work.

1782
01:15:27.039 --> 01:15:28.480
You two. Good.

1783
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.549
Good job.

1784
01:15:30.549 --> 01:15:33.079
Good. Good job.

1785
01:15:33.079 --> 01:15:34.749
Good job.

1786
01:15:36.749 --> 01:15:38.289
Will Seol A and Soo A...

1787
01:15:38.289 --> 01:15:40.589
be able to solve this problem too?

1788
01:15:40.589 --> 01:15:42.489
(How will they solve this problem?)

1789
01:15:43.329 --> 01:15:45.230
(Soo A can carry it by herself.)

1790
01:15:45.799 --> 01:15:47.760
(The crock is fine for now.)

1791
01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.299
Let's hurry up and do ours.

1792
01:15:49.299 --> 01:15:51.470
Let's pour in a lot.

1793
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:53.400
Let's fill it up.

1794
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:54.739
Okay.

1795
01:15:54.739 --> 01:15:58.270
(The twins are ambitious.)

1796
01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.409
Oh, no.

1797
01:16:02.049 --> 01:16:04.949
Seol A, you...

1798
01:16:04.949 --> 01:16:07.619
Let's pick up the ones we dropped.

1799
01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.919
Since you dropped it, you have to do it.

1800
01:16:09.919 --> 01:16:11.049
Pick it all up.

1801
01:16:11.049 --> 01:16:13.220
I'll pick it all up.

1802
01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.329
There.

1803
01:16:15.589 --> 01:16:16.890
(Oh, no)

1804
01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:18.060
(Peeking)

1805
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:21.329
I did it too. I'm sorry.

1806
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:25.570
(As they were filling up the crock...)

1807
01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:28.470
Things were going smoothly.

1808
01:16:29.339 --> 01:16:32.510
Then the crock suddenly broke.

1809
01:16:32.539 --> 01:16:34.409
How will the kids react?

1810
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:37.010
What?

1811
01:16:37.449 --> 01:16:39.020
The popped rice...

1812
01:16:39.419 --> 01:16:40.850
What do we do?

1813
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:44.489
Hey, they all fell out.

1814
01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:46.789
(Is it broken?)

1815
01:16:47.089 --> 01:16:48.860
Why is ours broken?

1816
01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:51.789
I don't know. Is it like this?

1817
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.999
What is this?

1818
01:16:54.199 --> 01:16:57.329
Why isn't it working? I have to fix it.

1819
01:16:57.829 --> 01:16:59.600
(She's pressing hard onto the piece.)

1820
01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.140
(Tapping)

1821
01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:02.310
I got it.

1822
01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:06.510
(Strong Soo A was able to fix it!)

1823
01:17:07.079 --> 01:17:10.709
Since you broke it, you have to put it in.

1824
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:14.949
No, you can't do that!

1825
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.159
You dropped a lot too!

1826
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.930
(Dumbfounded)

1827
01:17:26.199 --> 01:17:27.600
(Dropping)

1828
01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:32.839
(Things aren't going well for these two.)

1829
01:17:33.239 --> 01:17:34.440
(Sighing)

1830
01:17:35.869 --> 01:17:37.470
(Glancing)

1831
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:41.739
Why are you mean to me?

1832
01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.780
(I just wanted to do a good job.)

1833
01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.459
When Cinderella was young

1834
01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:55.629
She was mistreated

1835
01:17:57.430 --> 01:18:00.159
Seol A, help me.

1836
01:18:00.730 --> 01:18:03.970
(You're right. It's no time for this.)

1837
01:18:04.699 --> 01:18:08.909
Should we move this to a clean spot?

1838
01:18:08.909 --> 01:18:11.610
1, 2, 3. Here we go.

1839
01:18:12.379 --> 01:18:13.879
(Spilling)

1840
01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:19.879
(It's leaking again.)

1841
01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:24.619
No...

1842
01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:27.720
We worked so hard for it.

1843
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.360
No, no. No...

1844
01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:34.100
Please, no.

1845
01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.199
No, don't.

1846
01:18:37.199 --> 01:18:39.570
No, stop spilling.

1847
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:42.810
I can't believe it.

1848
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:44.470
No!

1849
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:47.739
(Soo A won't give up.)

1850
01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.249
(Soo A is punching with her powerful fist.)

1851
01:18:51.249 --> 01:18:53.749
(She's talented at fixing the crock.)

1852
01:18:53.749 --> 01:18:56.449
I fixed the crock.

1853
01:18:56.919 --> 01:18:58.890
Really?

1854
01:19:00.119 --> 01:19:02.260
Soo A, you're amazing.

1855
01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.860
How did you fix it?

1856
01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.430
Let's hurry.

1857
01:19:06.459 --> 01:19:07.629
Seol A.

1858
01:19:07.629 --> 01:19:10.770
Look at this. Let's go.

1859
01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:14.799
(They're snacking on it here and there.)

1860
01:19:18.539 --> 01:19:21.640
(They're working hard to fill the crock.)

1861
01:19:22.049 --> 01:19:23.709
Let's see.

1862
01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:29.089
We filled a lot, didn't we?

1863
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:32.089
I'll go get the Master.

1864
01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:35.530
Press hard on it until I come back.

1865
01:19:35.530 --> 01:19:36.560
Okay.

1866
01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.190
Keep watching it.

1867
01:19:42.329 --> 01:19:43.629
It spilled.

1868
01:19:44.329 --> 01:19:45.499
It spilled.

1869
01:19:45.499 --> 01:19:47.999
(What?)

1870
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:53.140
(You're a joker.)

1871
01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:55.180
Master!

1872
01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.879
It's spilling...

1873
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:58.549
No.

1874
01:19:59.049 --> 01:20:01.379
We filled it up!

1875
01:20:01.379 --> 01:20:03.190
Okay, okay.

1876
01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:06.619
We dropped a lot on the floor. A lot.

1877
01:20:06.619 --> 01:20:09.629
You dropped some? Why did you drop it?

1878
01:20:10.659 --> 01:20:12.930
(It's a complete mess.)

1879
01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:16.169
Why are there so much on the floor?

1880
01:20:16.169 --> 01:20:18.230
It's because there is a hole.

1881
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.869
It's broken.

1882
01:20:19.869 --> 01:20:20.970
Why did it break?

1883
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:23.940
Who broke this precious crock?

1884
01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:27.909
I was putting some in when it broke.

1885
01:20:27.909 --> 01:20:29.510
It broke when you were filling it?

1886
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:30.510
Yes.

1887
01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:32.449
Really?

1888
01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.949
But I fixed it.

1889
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:37.949
- You fixed it? Who did? - Soo A did.

1890
01:20:38.049 --> 01:20:40.890
We filled it up.

1891
01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:42.230
- Soo A did? - Yes.

1892
01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:44.159
You're so smart.

1893
01:20:44.159 --> 01:20:46.030
- It was broken. - Yes.

1894
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:48.669
However, you fixed it together.

1895
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:50.470
- You filled it too. - Yes.

1896
01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:53.140
If a problem like this happens again,

1897
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.239
you can work together to solve it.

1898
01:20:56.339 --> 01:20:58.539
- You'll become great. - Yes.

1899
01:20:58.539 --> 01:20:59.610
Good job.

1900
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:02.549
(What about Seo Eon and Seo Jun?)

1901
01:21:02.549 --> 01:21:04.409
Seo Eon and Seo Jun are unpredictable.

1902
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:07.619
How will these two solve the problem?

1903
01:21:07.619 --> 01:21:08.850
(The twins are checking the materials.)

1904
01:21:17.089 --> 01:21:19.459
The crock broke again.

1905
01:21:20.159 --> 01:21:21.530
How will the twins react?

1906
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:23.230
(What happened?)

1907
01:21:24.329 --> 01:21:26.669
There's a hole.

1908
01:21:27.539 --> 01:21:32.010
(They're trying to put the piece back.)

1909
01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:35.549
(It's not easy to put in.)

1910
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.650
What happened?

1911
01:21:39.949 --> 01:21:41.480
It's broken. What do we do?

1912
01:21:42.489 --> 01:21:44.720
What should we do?

1913
01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:48.530
This. What do we do with this?

1914
01:21:50.829 --> 01:21:54.560
(Genius Seo Jun is thinking hard.)

1915
01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.270
(The twins are looking around the room.)

1916
01:21:58.999 --> 01:22:01.140
There isn't anything.

1917
01:22:07.079 --> 01:22:09.249
Do you have anything we can block it with?

1918
01:22:10.879 --> 01:22:12.150
No, I don't.

1919
01:22:13.079 --> 01:22:15.589
(It's too bad.)

1920
01:22:15.650 --> 01:22:18.489
(In order to block the hole...)

1921
01:22:18.489 --> 01:22:19.989
Tape.

1922
01:22:20.919 --> 01:22:23.129
Tape...

1923
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:28.299
Where can I get some tape?

1924
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:31.999
(Where can I get some tape?)

1925
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:34.339
You probably should go to the other room.

1926
01:22:36.339 --> 01:22:38.909
(The twins are going to look for tape.)

1927
01:22:38.909 --> 01:22:40.440
I'm scared.

1928
01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:43.350
Sir, the kids are coming.

1929
01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:45.320
Why?

1930
01:22:46.150 --> 01:22:48.919
(He acts as if he's sleeping.)

1931
01:22:50.449 --> 01:22:51.619
(They're opening the Master's room.)

1932
01:22:51.619 --> 01:22:53.890
The twins carefully open the door.

1933
01:22:54.659 --> 01:22:57.260
(He's sleeping.)

1934
01:22:57.959 --> 01:23:01.600
They search after seeing the Master's asleep.

1935
01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.470
(The twins are looking for tape.)

1936
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:11.940
(What are they doing?)

1937
01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.980
They finally found tape.

1938
01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:20.680
(Halting)

1939
01:23:20.919 --> 01:23:22.190
Tape...

1940
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:26.720
(Grunting)

1941
01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.060
(I'll trust you, Seo Eon.)

1942
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.360
(He's being careful.)

1943
01:23:33.959 --> 01:23:37.730
(Seo Eon has collected a roll of tape.)

1944
01:23:37.869 --> 01:23:42.010
(They're quick to leave the room.)

1945
01:23:45.810 --> 01:23:47.739
(Gosh, you kids.)

1946
01:23:50.049 --> 01:23:51.079
I found it.

1947
01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:52.749
(We got it.)

1948
01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:54.220
We got it.

1949
01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:55.749
Right?

1950
01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:59.459
You're awesome. This is awesome.

1951
01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.390
(He's getting weak in the knees.)

1952
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:04.260
We got it. It's going to work.

1953
01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:05.860
It'll work.

1954
01:24:07.299 --> 01:24:09.270
I'll cover it now.

1955
01:24:09.499 --> 01:24:11.129
Seo Eon, I'll cover it.

1956
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:14.839
(All they have to do is tape it on.)

1957
01:24:14.839 --> 01:24:17.339
You got it. Okay.

1958
01:24:17.339 --> 01:24:18.739
(How do I cut this?)

1959
01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.110
(It won't rip with bare hands.)

1960
01:24:23.709 --> 01:24:25.350
We need scissors.

1961
01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:27.449
I better go get some.

1962
01:24:27.449 --> 01:24:28.850
Are you going to grab some?

1963
01:24:28.989 --> 01:24:30.220
We need scissors.

1964
01:24:32.589 --> 01:24:33.690
(Confident)

1965
01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:35.659
It's only hard the first time.

1966
01:24:35.659 --> 01:24:37.329
He more daring now.

1967
01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:42.400
(This place looks familiar.)

1968
01:24:43.799 --> 01:24:44.869
(Here they are!)

1969
01:24:44.869 --> 01:24:47.039
(He's so nervous, so he's biting his lips.)

1970
01:24:47.799 --> 01:24:49.369
(Coughing)

1971
01:24:49.369 --> 01:24:50.470
He scared me.

1972
01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:00.150
(Seo Jun, I got scissors.)

1973
01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:02.150
- Seo Jun, I got scissors. - Hey.

1974
01:25:03.489 --> 01:25:05.459
(Good job, partner.)

1975
01:25:06.489 --> 01:25:07.890
It was scary...

1976
01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:11.360
going into the Master's room, right?

1977
01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.999
- I faced it anyway. - Me too.

1978
01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.999
Keep holding it.

1979
01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:18.369
I'm going to tape it on.

1980
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:19.999
Tape...

1981
01:25:20.339 --> 01:25:21.570
There.

1982
01:25:21.570 --> 01:25:23.510
(The twins are fixing the broken crock.)

1983
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:25.640
- Keep holding it. - Did you stick it on?

1984
01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.579
It's fixed.

1985
01:25:29.049 --> 01:25:31.680
Let's put the rice in now.

1986
01:25:33.079 --> 01:25:37.320
(They fixed the problem without any spills.)

1987
01:25:38.089 --> 01:25:39.820
Not even a grain is falling.

1988
01:25:40.289 --> 01:25:41.360
Really?

1989
01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.129
It's pretty strong.

1990
01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:49.329
(Then one might suddenly question...)

1991
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:51.699
Why do we have to do this?

1992
01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:53.140
I don't know.

1993
01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.310
Why do they want us to move so much?

1994
01:25:57.539 --> 01:25:58.810
I don't know.

1995
01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:02.909
We can just eat it. Why are we moving it?

1996
01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:06.320
The Master must really like these.

1997
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.379
(It's their conclusion.)

1998
01:26:07.619 --> 01:26:10.390
(I see.)

1999
01:26:11.650 --> 01:26:13.919
The boys are quickly moving the popped rice.

2000
01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:15.089
Then...

2001
01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:20.329
(Seo Eon is studying the crock.)

2002
01:26:21.799 --> 01:26:22.999
It's still leaking.

2003
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:24.499
No.

2004
01:26:26.199 --> 01:26:27.600
It's coming out.

2005
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:30.739
Hold on. Let me try to fix it.

2006
01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:34.239
It's coming from this side.

2007
01:26:34.579 --> 01:26:36.079
Can you cut this?

2008
01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.280
I will cut it for you.

2009
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:40.350
I'll use the scissors.

2010
01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.619
Done. I'll put it on this time.

2011
01:26:42.619 --> 01:26:44.749
It's too fast. No.

2012
01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.560
It's all falling. What I need is speed.

2013
01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.629
(What I need is speed.)

2014
01:26:53.799 --> 01:26:55.900
- Let's stop. - It's done.

2015
01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:57.129
(They're done fixing the broken crock.)

2016
01:26:57.299 --> 01:26:59.039
Here comes the rice.

2017
01:27:00.199 --> 01:27:02.409
(They finished filling the crock.)

2018
01:27:03.869 --> 01:27:07.579
- Master, we're done! - Master, we're done!

2019
01:27:07.879 --> 01:27:11.049
Master, we're finished!

2020
01:27:11.579 --> 01:27:13.980
Gosh.

2021
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:16.489
My...

2022
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:19.320
What happened here?

2023
01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.829
There was a hole, so we fixed it with tape.

2024
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:28.430
Where did you get this tape from?

2025
01:27:29.530 --> 01:27:32.199
The twins are startled by the sudden question.

2026
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:34.470
How will they deal with the situation?

2027
01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:39.739
We couldn't find tape here,

2028
01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:44.049
so we brought it from your room.

2029
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:46.249
You were sleeping.

2030
01:27:46.379 --> 01:27:49.190
- You took it from me? - Yes.

2031
01:27:49.249 --> 01:27:51.520
Why didn't you wake me up?

2032
01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.159
(Smiling)

2033
01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:55.789
- Why... - We wanted you to sleep.

2034
01:27:55.959 --> 01:27:58.430
- You wanted me to sleep? - Yes.

2035
01:27:58.489 --> 01:28:01.129
Did you fill this up together?

2036
01:28:01.159 --> 01:28:02.230
- Yes. - Yes.

2037
01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:03.669
Good job.

2038
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:05.640
The reason why I made you do this...

2039
01:28:05.869 --> 01:28:09.010
is because I wanted to see what you would do...

2040
01:28:09.010 --> 01:28:12.980
if you were faced with a problem.

2041
01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.510
You should compliment each other.

2042
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:20.419
(The kids depended on each other.)

2043
01:28:20.419 --> 01:28:21.579
Good job.

2044
01:28:21.989 --> 01:28:23.289
Good job.

2045
01:28:23.289 --> 01:28:25.360
(Good job, boys.)

2046
01:28:25.919 --> 01:28:28.589
Single file. Stand in a line.

2047
01:28:29.129 --> 01:28:30.860
I'm in the middle.

2048
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:33.260
No, I'm in the middle.

2049
01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:36.030
- Attention. - Attention.

2050
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:38.230
- Let's get ready. - Hey, hey.

2051
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:39.839
Get ready.

2052
01:28:39.839 --> 01:28:41.799
Stop chasing it.

2053
01:28:41.799 --> 01:28:42.909
Where are you going?

2054
01:28:43.839 --> 01:28:45.879
No, this way. Hurry!

2055
01:28:45.879 --> 01:28:46.879
(William is free-spirited.)

2056
01:28:47.879 --> 01:28:50.379
(Lo Hee is free-spirited too.)

2057
01:28:50.549 --> 01:28:52.419
(I caught you.)

2058
01:28:53.919 --> 01:28:55.650
(Giggling)

2059
01:28:56.449 --> 01:28:59.890
Dear audiences and fans of The Return of Superman,

2060
01:28:59.989 --> 01:29:01.260
be happy.

2061
01:29:01.459 --> 01:29:03.230
- Be happy. - Be happy!

2062
01:29:03.289 --> 01:29:06.030
- Be happy. - Be happy.

2063
01:29:06.299 --> 01:29:07.730
- Bow. - Bow.

2064
01:29:07.829 --> 01:29:10.199
- Knees. - Sit down.

2065
01:29:10.329 --> 01:29:12.970
Hey, hey.

2066
01:29:12.970 --> 01:29:14.199
Get back up.

2067
01:29:14.739 --> 01:29:16.209
- Attention. - Hey.

2068
01:29:16.209 --> 01:29:17.640
- Attention. - Attention.

2069
01:29:18.010 --> 01:29:19.780
Thank you, everyone!

2070
01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:21.909
- Thank you. - Bow.

2071
01:29:21.909 --> 01:29:24.650
- Say thank you. - Bow. Attention.

2072
01:29:24.650 --> 01:29:26.180
- Attention. - Attention.

2073
01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:28.020
- Thank you. - Thank you!

2074
01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.549
Thank you!

2075
01:29:29.890 --> 01:29:31.919
Don't go over there.

2076
01:29:31.919 --> 01:29:34.459
You have say thank you. Thank you.

2077
01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:36.060
Thank you.

2078
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:38.289
Hey, it's too late for a bow.
