1
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.200
Kim Jae Hwan, come in right now. And Song Eun Jae, get out.

2
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.900
- Professor. - Didn't you hear me?

3
00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:18.998
(Episode 24)

4
00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.269
Why is the patient's guardian near the operating room?

5
00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:24.139
Song Eun Jae,

6
00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:25.970
didn't you hear me telling you to get out?

7
00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.780
I think this foolish doctor...

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.149
doesn't know where the waiting room is.

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.550
Director, will you show her the way?

10
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.550
Yes.

11
00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:39.920
Of course.

12
00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.990
Doctor Song, follow me outside.

13
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.170
Thank you,

14
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.869
Professor.

15
00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:57.410
Please treat...

16
00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.939
my father well.

17
00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:11.520
Doctor Song, let's go outside.

18
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.009
We'll begin the hepaticopancreatic duodenum...

19
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.619
resection surgery of Song Jae Joon.

20
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.050
Ease your shoulder and neck muscles.

21
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.819
It's a surgery we do every day.

22
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.559
You shouldn't get nervous because it's Doctor Song's dad.

23
00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:52.990
I understand.

24
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.429
Kim Jae Hwan, do you understand?

25
00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.100
Of course.

26
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.699
Let's begin.

27
00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:06.610
Scalpel.

28
00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.179
(Operating Room)

29
00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.950
What happened? Why are you already here?

30
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.460
- Did something happen to Dad? - No.

31
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.129
They're proceeding the surgery as planned.

32
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.860
But... But why are you here?

33
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.960
It's a long story.

34
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.820
Here. Eat it later.

35
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.420
We need to have a memorial service for our grandparents first.

36
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.129
But I'm hungry.

37
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.700
No one gave me food.

38
00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.349
Doctor Song's father...

39
00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.379
is in surgery.

40
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.059
If you weren't sick, you'd have...

41
00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.290
agreed to the surgery right away.

42
00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.200
Then,

43
00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:42.270
Doctor Song wouldn't have been so worried.

44
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.570
Right?

45
00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.440
(Kim Jae Min, "I always love you, Son.")

46
00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.299
Come here.

47
00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.500
Come here and...

48
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.140
give them to your brother.

49
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.710
Give them to him...

50
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.279
and say hi.

51
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.279
Go on. Don't make her wait.

52
00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:06.989
Go and say hi.

53
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.589
You haven't been here since your brother died.

54
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.359
He must've missed you so much.

55
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.380
(Kim Jae Min. We love you, son.)

56
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.669
- Honey. - Jae Geol.

57
00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:59.570
Stay here.

58
00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:19.060
What are you doing here?

59
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.930
You're right.

60
00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:26.940
I killed Jae Min.

61
00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:31.770
- I killed him. - You didn't.

62
00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.210
If only I hadn't called him.

63
00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.589
If I hadn't asked him to...

64
00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:47.289
pick me up at the airport on that rainy day.

65
00:06:49.989 --> 00:06:53.289
If only I hadn't traveled to places like India just so...

66
00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:56.859
I could brag about it.

67
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.039
Who made you want to leave home and Korea?

68
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:05.710
Who compared you to Jae Min...

69
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.010
and left you feeling inferior?

70
00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:12.310
And then,

71
00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:16.250
I took out my anger on you which was wrong too.

72
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.390
Dad.

73
00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:22.620
I was angry.

74
00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:27.799
Losing your brother so unexpectedly like that...

75
00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:29.399
left me so furious.

76
00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:33.270
I couldn't stand it.

77
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.810
I had to vent my fury at someone...

78
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.479
just so I could survive.

79
00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:51.349
I shouldn't have treated you like that.

80
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.289
It was wrong of me...

81
00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:57.359
to do that to my own son.

82
00:07:57.659 --> 00:07:58.760
No.

83
00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:02.359
It was only right.

84
00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:06.130
Jae Min died because of me.

85
00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:09.570
- So Dad... - Stop it.

86
00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:17.779
Doctor Kim.

87
00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:20.779
Give me your opinion as a doctor.

88
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.390
What was Kim Jae Min's cause of death?

89
00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:26.649
- Dad. - Your brother.

90
00:08:27.489 --> 00:08:29.190
Don't speak to me as his brother.

91
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.729
As a doctor who was last to diagnose a dying patient,

92
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.200
give me your opinion.

93
00:08:36.629 --> 00:08:38.330
What was the cause of death?

94
00:08:48.379 --> 00:08:49.979
Due to a traffic accident,

95
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.080
he suffered from multiple fractures...

96
00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:57.790
and a brain hemorrhage...

97
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.790
caused by external trauma.

98
00:09:04.489 --> 00:09:07.400
Right. I concur with that result.

99
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.570
So from now on, do not forget.

100
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.300
Your brother...

101
00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:15.670
did not die because of you.

102
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.670
(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

103
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.170
- Hey. - Mr. Chu.

104
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.170
What happened?

105
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.509
They just begun.

106
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:29.910
The arduous, 12-hour journey.

107
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.150
12 hours?

108
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.979
It depends on the patient's condition.

109
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.389
What are you doing here?

110
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:43.589
Didn't you say you were going to see the kids?

111
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.129
Well...

112
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.629
Who is it?

113
00:11:18.859 --> 00:11:21.560
- It's me. - What do you want?

114
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.430
It's Chuseok. I wanted to see the kids.

115
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.369
They aren't in.

116
00:11:30.369 --> 00:11:32.210
They're at the library, studying for their mid-terms.

117
00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:34.979
Couldn't you have given them the day off on a holiday?

118
00:11:34.979 --> 00:11:37.180
Students need to take breaks to...

119
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.349
What if they do?

120
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.979
We split up and can't afford to get them...

121
00:11:41.979 --> 00:11:43.619
private tutors or classes.

122
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.519
What will they become if they don't study?

123
00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:48.859
- Honey. - Don't call me that.

124
00:11:49.859 --> 00:11:52.930
We signed the divorce papers seven years ago.

125
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.599
The ink isn't only dry. It's fading.

126
00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:59.269
If you want to come by every now and then...

127
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.700
and pretend to be a caring dad when you can't offer anything else,

128
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.910
stop coming at all.

129
00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:06.469
- I just... - When they grow up,

130
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.180
the kids will find you even if I tell them not to.

131
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.410
So don't confuse them by coming over.

132
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:20.960
What's this?

133
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.160
My Chuseok bonus and some pocket money...

134
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.330
for the kids.

135
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.280
You shouldn't have worked so hard.

136
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.979
You should've left the hospital ship after 10 years.

137
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:52.950
I did consider doing that,

138
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.859
but when the time came, I didn't want to leave.

139
00:12:56.219 --> 00:12:57.859
It's not that you didn't want to.

140
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.330
You couldn't.

141
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.830
You had patients to tend to...

142
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.469
and young doctors to instill some sense into.

143
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:09.440
You didn't have the time to leave.

144
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.269
And now, you brought us a surgeon.

145
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.080
Regardless of what people say,

146
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.680
our ship got this far because of you.

147
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.790
We could've become shipwrecked long ago.

148
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.119
That's just pure nonsense.

149
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.359
Check your phone. It's been ringing off the hook.

150
00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:32.229
- Oh, right. - Here.

151
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.369
- Tell her to cheer up. - Are you with her?

152
00:13:37.369 --> 00:13:38.670
I'd be there if it weren't Chuseok.

153
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.969
What happened to Doctor Song's dad?

154
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.300
What is it?

155
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.410
The doctors and staff of the ship.

156
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:49.940
They're asking about Doctor Song's dad.

157
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.009
See? That's what they're like.

158
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:54.119
They all left for the holidays,

159
00:13:54.119 --> 00:13:57.190
and they assume you'll be at the hospital.

160
00:14:01.989 --> 00:14:03.389
If you're upset,

161
00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:07.060
try to brush it off, and cheer up.

162
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.729
You have so many followers.

Scissors.

167
00:14:39.989 --> 00:14:41.229
How are things?

168
00:14:41.229 --> 00:14:45.200
It's a tough operation, but things are going well so far.

169

00:15:20.239 --> 00:15:22.839
- Are you anxious? - No.

172
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.710
Sit down.

173
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.879
It's only been six hours.

174
00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:31.009
You said it'll take over 10 hours.

175
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.210
Did something go wrong? Wait here.

176
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.479
I'll go and check.

177
00:15:35.119 --> 00:15:37.619
I said it's only been six hours.

178
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.190
Is this what Hyun was worried about?

179
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:45.389
He told me to look after you.

180
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.030
He said it could be worse for you.

181
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.869
He also said this.

182
00:15:50.869 --> 00:15:52.570
"If they don't call you during the procedure,"

183
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.900
"it means the surgery is going smoothly."

184
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.040
"So don't get anxious, and just wait."

185
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.710
You know that, don't you?

186
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:05.550
Sit down. Let's take a break.

187
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.389
Drink this. I chose something to soothe you.

188
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.830
You're all grown up.

189
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.710
Doctor, blood.

190
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:40.249
Where's it coming from?

191
00:16:41.349 --> 00:16:42.719
Kim Jae Hwan, focus.

192
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.119
Will you take the blame if he dies of a hemorrhage?

193
00:16:56.143 --> 00:16:59.375

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

194
00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:10.950
His blood pressure's falling.

195
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.390
Where's the leak?

196
00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:20.019
Where's it coming from?

197
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.350
How did it go?

198
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.190
The surgery...

199
00:17:56.759 --> 00:17:58.789
went really well.

200
00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:04.900
Eun Jae.

201
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.069
We'll have to wait and see,

202
00:18:09.069 --> 00:18:11.569
but the tumor's well and completely out.

203
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.940
Eun Jae, will Dad live?

204
00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.279
He will make it, right?

205
00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:22.819
(Operating Room)

206
00:18:23.219 --> 00:18:25.749
Mr. Song. Mr. Song?

207
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.819
Wake up.

208
00:18:28.019 --> 00:18:29.789
Where are we?

209
00:18:30.229 --> 00:18:32.660
Mr. Song. Mr. Song.

210
00:18:33.759 --> 00:18:34.960
Dad.

211
00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:37.400
Dad, are you awake?

212
00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:38.969
Dad.

213
00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:17.809
Well done.

214
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.319
You did it.

215
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.979
Eun Jae?

216
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.579
Do you still drink sweet coffee after an operation?

217
00:20:00.749 --> 00:20:03.620
Of course, I do. Then it's really over.

218
00:20:08.289 --> 00:20:10.160
Two teaspoons of coffee, sugar, and creamer.

219
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.789
More sugar?

220
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.299
Why don't you just drown me in sugar?

221
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.360
Mine has three teaspoons of sugar.

222
00:20:16.829 --> 00:20:18.029
What?

223
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.710
You and I...

224
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.210
sat side by side drinking sweet coffee...

225
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.350
after many, countless surgeries.

226
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.120
We worked opposite each other...

227
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.249
on many cases too.

228
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:41.559
We worked great together.

229
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.160
You were a great leader.

230
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.729
I apologize.

231
00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.700
I ruined your holiday...

232
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.799
by asking for your help.

233
00:20:58.039 --> 00:21:01.239
It's fine. Since when did we get holidays off?

234
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.090
I know what it is that you want to say.

235
00:21:19.729 --> 00:21:21.630
You don't have to try so hard.

236
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.100
Professor.

237
00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:30.370
Thank you.

238
00:21:33.069 --> 00:21:35.140
I should thank you.

239
00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:38.850
You made the tougher decision.

240
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:41.650
Thank you.

241
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.190
For entrusting me to be the surgeon.

242
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:49.590
Thank you.

243
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.289
And sorry.

244
00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:57.130
When a surgeon makes a mistake in the operation room...

245
00:21:58.469 --> 00:21:59.529
To be honest,

246
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.670
although the patient and family will never wish to accept it,

247
00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.140
mistakes and accidents do happen during operations.

248
00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:12.350
Doctors are human after all.

249
00:22:14.019 --> 00:22:16.479
I tried to make my pupil cover up...

250
00:22:16.479 --> 00:22:18.620
my mistake and bury the truth.

251
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.259
That was wrong.

252
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.930
I don't know why I did that.

253
00:22:29.529 --> 00:22:30.799
I was scared.

254
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.269
I could only think of the things I would lose.

255
00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:37.210
The criticisms and attacks.

256
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.440
My ruined reputation.

257
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.809
I could risk my position and title.

258
00:22:45.809 --> 00:22:47.680
This is the fun of it.

259
00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.350
Whether others recognize me or not,

260
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.789
I act like I can take on the deities while being armed with a scalpel...

261
00:22:56.819 --> 00:22:59.789
and sweat all night in a room to save a patient.

262
00:23:00.329 --> 00:23:02.960
Then have a cup of cheap, sweet coffee.

263
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.069
I thought this would be...

264
00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:10.769
more than enough to keep me going.

265
00:23:16.009 --> 00:23:17.809
Thanks for the coffee.

266
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.219
I haven't had a cup this good in a while.

267
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:25.350
I hope I can enjoy this more often in the future.

268
00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:39.600
You've been through a lot since I exiled you.

269
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.069
I think you should come back.

270
00:23:43.969 --> 00:23:46.239
Jang Sung Ho wants you back,

271
00:23:46.239 --> 00:23:48.079
and the hospital director is feeling the pressure.

272
00:23:48.809 --> 00:23:51.009
You'll easily make an assistant professor.

273
00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:52.950
- So... - No.

274
00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.390
I want to stay on board the hospital ship.

275
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:59.989
You want to stay? Why?

276
00:24:02.289 --> 00:24:04.259
I guess like you,

277
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.529
I want to take on the deities while being armed with a scalpel.

278
00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:12.700
I'm the only surgeon on board.

279
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.539
I get a lot of opportunities.

280
00:24:15.739 --> 00:24:18.039
- What? - And...

281
00:24:19.309 --> 00:24:20.640
And what?

282
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.710
There's more?

283
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.559
- Here you go. - Here.

284
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.289
- What's all this? - Have a taste.

285
00:24:37.289 --> 00:24:38.989
He cooked it all.

286
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.999
The surgery went well.

287
00:24:40.999 --> 00:24:42.759
We should celebrate Chuseok.

288
00:24:42.759 --> 00:24:44.969
- You bet we should. - Thank you.

289
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.400
Oh dear.

290
00:24:46.499 --> 00:24:49.600
Gosh, you beat me to it.

291
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.009
I brought some food too.

292
00:24:51.469 --> 00:24:52.739
- Goodness. - Me too.

293
00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:54.910
Everyone brought something.

294
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.479
You said that we'd be first.

295
00:24:56.479 --> 00:24:59.150
I thought everyone would arrive later.

296
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.920
- My goodness. - Where's Eun Jae?

297
00:25:01.049 --> 00:25:02.380
She went to see the professor.

298
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.319
Did everyone plan to meet here?

299
00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:08.059
- Not at all. - We read each other's mind.

300
00:25:08.059 --> 00:25:09.690
They're like The Three Musketeers.

301
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.160
They even brought a cake.

302
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.059
Here are the chopsticks.

303
00:25:14.059 --> 00:25:16.860
- Everyone, eat. - That's right.

304
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.769
- Thank you. - Thank you.

305
00:25:20.069 --> 00:25:22.640
By the way, who is he?

306
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.009
Hello, I'm Woo Jae, Eun Jae's younger brother.

307
00:25:25.009 --> 00:25:26.910
- Are you Dr. Song's brother? - Yes.

308
00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.410
You're handsome.

309
00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.710
Nurse Yoo, can you sing for us?

310
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.410
- Sing. - Go ahead.

311
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.150
1, 2, 1, 2, 3.

312
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.620
It's Chuseok, it's Chuseok

313
00:25:39.019 --> 00:25:40.420
That's great.

314
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.590
Let's sing together.

315
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.100
Help yourselves.

316
00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:36.309
(Oh Hye Jung)

317
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.460
What is that?

318
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.299
What's that next to the photo of your mother?

319
00:26:56.059 --> 00:26:58.069
That's our family photo.

320
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.769
I put it there for Mom.

321
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.309
When was it?

322
00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.610
It was at the amusement park 100 days after Woo Jae was born.

323
00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.950
How do you remember that?

324
00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.950
It was our first time...

325
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.719
at an amusement park.

326
00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.660
It was also our first family photo.

327
00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:25.489
I think that was the first and the last time.

328
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.900
It isn't the last time.

329
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.729
We'll take photos every day.

330
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.600
Dad, turn around.

331
00:27:36.569 --> 00:27:38.640
Come this way. Eun Jae, come here now.

332
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.840
- What are you doing? - Come here.

333
00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:42.809
Stand right here.

334
00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:44.749
Why isn't he coming?

335
00:27:46.479 --> 00:27:47.479
Hello, Hyun.

336
00:27:48.579 --> 00:27:49.920
What brings you here?

337
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:51.850
I'm sorry for being late.

338
00:27:52.249 --> 00:27:54.190
I had to bring the camera from Seoul.

339
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.229
Why did you go all the way to Seoul? Any camera would be fine.

340
00:27:58.489 --> 00:28:01.460
No way. You haven't taken a family photo in a long time.

341
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.600
Please get ready. I'll take a photo.

342
00:28:06.069 --> 00:28:07.100
Okay.

343
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:08.969
(Oh Hye Jung)

344
00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.440
Can you smile?

345
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.450
Are you about to enter a combat? You look so grim.

346
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:21.779
Come on, Eun Jae.

347
00:28:22.749 --> 00:28:23.989
Smile.

348
00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:40.640
In 1, 2, 3.
