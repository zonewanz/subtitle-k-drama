3
00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:22.342
(Final Episode)

4
00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:24.611
Here. I will show you...

5
00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:28.882
what is true and what is false.

6
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.968
Apostle Kang.

7
00:00:53.573 --> 00:00:54.941
- No. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

8
00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:56.609
Oh, no.

9
00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:09.322
Now, take a look.

10
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:15.161
Do you think this Book of Salvation which burned to ashes is the truth?

11
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:19.299
Or am I, whom even the fire couldn't hurt, the truth?

12
00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:22.602
- Spiritual Father. - Goodness.

13
00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:25.739
I shall now stay within you.

14
00:01:26.272 --> 00:01:29.809
I shall declare the truth through your mouth.

15
00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:31.711
I shall lift your arm...

16
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.080
and perform miracles.

17
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.551
And I shall lead you to the door to salvation.

18
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:42.822
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

19
00:01:57.537 --> 00:01:59.172
Why did you want to see me?

20
00:01:59.172 --> 00:02:02.442
Where did you hide my mom?

21
00:02:02.742 --> 00:02:04.110
We didn't hide her.

22
00:02:04.577 --> 00:02:07.881
We just moved her to a better place for her treatment.

23
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:11.818
You satisfy your desire using a powerless person.

24
00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:14.087
It's just like that cult.

25
00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:16.423
You and my dad are...

26
00:02:16.423 --> 00:02:17.891
as crazy as them!

27
00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:19.893
You will realize it after a while.

28
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.861
In this world,

29
00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:25.832
what's real and what's false are not different.

30
00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:30.103
So don't try so hard to distinguish the real from the false.

31
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.572
It will only make your life harder.

32
00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.542
If that's how you live your life,

33
00:02:36.142 --> 00:02:38.077
I will never live mine the same way.

34
00:02:38.077 --> 00:02:39.913
I told you to give me...

35
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.382
the voice recorder if you want to see your mom.

36
00:02:45.518 --> 00:02:46.519
It looked like...

37
00:02:47.287 --> 00:02:49.622
your mom misses you a lot.

38
00:03:12.412 --> 00:03:15.682
Your... Your father...

39
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.017
He...

40
00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:20.220
pushed me.

41
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:22.822
How could you...

42
00:03:23.523 --> 00:03:25.458
How could you do this to me?

43
00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:27.026
Ji Hee is your assistant!

44
00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:28.061
It's a misunderstanding.

45
00:03:28.628 --> 00:03:31.631
There seems to be a big misunderstanding.

46
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:32.699
Withdraw your candidacy.

47
00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:35.702
What?

48
00:03:35.702 --> 00:03:37.170
If it's really a misunderstanding...

49
00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:39.472
just like you said,

50
00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.708
withdraw your candidacy.

51
00:03:43.343 --> 00:03:45.378
Tomorrow is the election.

52
00:03:45.378 --> 00:03:46.679
I want Sang Hwan...

53
00:03:48.448 --> 00:03:50.450
to lead an honorable life.

54
00:03:53.853 --> 00:03:54.988
If you don't,

55
00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:00.293
I will give this dash camera footage to Mr. Cheon, your competitor.

56
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.233
No. Give it to me.

57
00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:21.881
Hi, is this Mr. Cheon's campaign office?

58
00:04:22.348 --> 00:04:23.383
Yes.

59
00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:38.431
You...

60
00:04:39.098 --> 00:04:40.099
and I...

61
00:04:41.034 --> 00:04:43.303
will have a spiritual wedding...

62
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.940
and become one.

63
00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:51.578
I will be at your service.

64
00:04:52.512 --> 00:04:53.680
My savior.

65
00:04:54.914 --> 00:04:56.449
My eternal life.

66
00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:57.617
My...

67
00:04:58.718 --> 00:04:59.919
Spiritual Father.

68
00:05:42.128 --> 00:05:45.264
Your mother will be so happy when she sees you...

69
00:05:45.798 --> 00:05:47.133
wearing this wedding dress.

70
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.069
I'm sure Sang Jin will be happy too.

71
00:05:54.741 --> 00:05:55.942
It was that day.

72
00:05:57.644 --> 00:05:59.479
- What? - That day,

73
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.382
if I had done everything I could...

74
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:04.417
to stop you,

75
00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:07.620
would things have turned out differently?

76
00:06:09.188 --> 00:06:10.256
Sang Mi.

77
00:06:10.623 --> 00:06:13.259
Your mother shouldn't be taken to the hospital.

78
00:06:14.193 --> 00:06:15.862
The only place that can treat her is Guseonwon.

79
00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.200
Dad.

80
00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:25.738
I pity you now.

81
00:06:26.973 --> 00:06:28.675
What are you talking about?

82
00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:30.510
Why would you pity me?

83
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.711
Because...

84
00:06:32.512 --> 00:06:34.681
you're not aware of how horrible...

85
00:06:36.082 --> 00:06:37.283
this situation is.

86
00:06:42.722 --> 00:06:43.890
Sang Mi.

87
00:06:44.323 --> 00:06:46.359
You shouldn't think like that anymore.

88
00:06:46.993 --> 00:06:50.263
You should be grateful for how blessed you are.

89
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.298
Just look forward to all the miraculous things...

90
00:06:53.232 --> 00:06:54.600
that will come your way.

91
00:06:55.802 --> 00:06:57.103
Okay?

92
00:07:24.997 --> 00:07:27.700
(Flame Resistant)

93
00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:38.678
- My goodness. - Unbelievable.

94
00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:48.788
Apostle Kang.

95
00:07:52.358 --> 00:07:55.528
What are you doing here?

96
00:08:06.973 --> 00:08:08.508
Our Almighty said...

97
00:08:09.142 --> 00:08:13.412
we can use white lies as strategies for salvation.

98
00:08:14.514 --> 00:08:15.882
Aren't I right?

99
00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:19.152
It doesn't matter whether you tell the truth or lie.

100
00:08:19.418 --> 00:08:22.622
Spreading our Almighty's words is a great thing in itself.

101
00:08:22.722 --> 00:08:25.691
Therefore, our Almighty shall continue to be happy.

102
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:30.196
Are you...

103
00:08:30.963 --> 00:08:32.732
being swayed right now?

104
00:08:33.733 --> 00:08:34.834
No.

105
00:08:37.036 --> 00:08:39.071
My devotion towards our Almighty will never get swayed.

106
00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:40.339
Then why...

107
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.142
do I see...

108
00:08:43.876 --> 00:08:46.179
doubt in your eyes?

109
00:08:47.747 --> 00:08:50.583
It's not because I doubt our Almighty.

110
00:08:54.587 --> 00:08:56.289
It's because I doubt you.

111
00:09:09.702 --> 00:09:10.970
Did you just say that...

112
00:09:12.672 --> 00:09:14.774
you're doubting me right now?

113
00:09:19.312 --> 00:09:22.682
Evil spirits keep spreading in Guseonwon.

114
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:26.752
I'm doubtful if you're fulfilling your duty of spreading...

115
00:09:26.752 --> 00:09:28.621
our Almighty's...

116
00:09:30.022 --> 00:09:31.324
words.

117
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:33.693
Doubt.

118
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.761
Anxiety.

119
00:09:36.128 --> 00:09:37.363
Fear.

120
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:40.032
These are all...

121
00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:43.102
thoughts of the devil.

122
00:09:43.703 --> 00:09:45.872
I want you to go to the prayer room right now...

123
00:09:46.672 --> 00:09:48.241
and repent.

124
00:09:52.378 --> 00:09:55.281
If I don't contact you by tomorrow morning...

125
00:09:55.948 --> 00:09:58.851
Will you really be able to disclose all this?

126
00:09:59.118 --> 00:10:01.854
You're basically strangling your father with your own hands.

127
00:10:03.222 --> 00:10:04.390
You can...

128
00:10:05.524 --> 00:10:07.860
disclose everything about my dad.

129
00:10:21.307 --> 00:10:24.210
Is there a patient named Chae Min Hwa here?

130
00:10:25.678 --> 00:10:26.812
No.

131
00:10:26.979 --> 00:10:29.382
Can you check again? Her name is Chae Min Hwa.

132
00:10:29.382 --> 00:10:30.616
Please do me a favor.

133
00:10:37.924 --> 00:10:40.593
Hello? Excuse me!

134
00:10:44.597 --> 00:10:45.698
Hey, Man Hee.

135
00:10:46.933 --> 00:10:48.100
Is she not there either?

136
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:50.303
Okay.

137
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:53.472
I'll go downtown to look for her.

138
00:10:54.307 --> 00:10:57.410
Call me if you find anything. Okay, thanks.

139
00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:28.641
Why isn't anyone coming out?

140
00:11:53.099 --> 00:11:54.667
My goodness.

141
00:11:56.402 --> 00:11:58.904
- Are you okay? - Please...

142
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.608
call...

143
00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:05.811
my son.

144
00:12:06.212 --> 00:12:08.647
You want me to call your son?

145
00:12:09.015 --> 00:12:10.516
What happened?

146
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.388
They... They brought me here against my will.

147
00:12:15.888 --> 00:12:17.390
You were forced to come here?

148
00:12:24.563 --> 00:12:27.800
Han Sang...

149
00:12:29.602 --> 00:12:31.804
- Hwan. - What?

150
00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:34.640
Han...

151
00:12:35.274 --> 00:12:36.909
Han Sang...

152
00:12:37.977 --> 00:12:39.912
- Hwan. - Hwan.

153
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.817
Is that your son's name? Han Sang Hwan?

154
00:12:47.753 --> 00:12:49.221
Do you know his phone number?

155
00:12:55.961 --> 00:12:57.630
Salvation.

156
00:12:58.497 --> 00:13:00.199
Eternal life.

157
00:13:02.968 --> 00:13:04.403
Salvation.

158
00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:08.107
Eternal life.

159
00:13:09.141 --> 00:13:11.844
Salvation. Eternal life.

160
00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:15.781
Go to your room. You should go to sleep.

161
00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:19.919
Our Almighty. Our wishes will be fulfilled.

162
00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:36.569
Hello?

163
00:13:36.602 --> 00:13:37.837
Are you Han Sang Hwan?

164
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.205
Yes, that's me.

165
00:13:40.439 --> 00:13:43.042
Your mother's safe. Don't worry.

166
00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:47.146
Who are you? No. Where is she?

167
00:13:47.146 --> 00:13:51.083
She's at Guseonwon Sanitarium.

168
00:13:51.717 --> 00:13:53.953
Wait. Wait.

169
00:14:09.068 --> 00:14:11.403
Sang Hwan, it's going to happen today at dawn.

170
00:14:11.403 --> 00:14:13.706
I'm going to do as we planned. I'll see you at dawn.

171
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.086
(Reset Settings: You will not be able to restore any information.)

172
00:14:52.344 --> 00:14:55.014
How dare you try to seduce my daughter?

173
00:14:55.014 --> 00:14:56.882
That's enough, Apostle Im.

174
00:15:01.554 --> 00:15:03.422
This is the only way we can...

175
00:15:03.789 --> 00:15:04.990
shake this place upside down.

176
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:07.560
If he finds out that I'm Sang Hwan's friend,

177
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.162
he'll lock me up in the basement storage...

178
00:15:10.162 --> 00:15:11.530
with other people.

179
00:15:13.265 --> 00:15:16.268
He said he had a cellphone inside that water tank.

180
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.038
Why are you doing this to me?

181
00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:22.441
Stop it. It's all over now.

182
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.344
I found it.

183
00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:28.280
It was true.

184
00:15:30.249 --> 00:15:31.450
Take him.

185
00:15:45.464 --> 00:15:47.900
When you met him outside,

186
00:15:49.168 --> 00:15:52.338
what did he say to you?

187
00:15:52.705 --> 00:15:56.575
He said he would save people here...

188
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:59.979
if I pretend not to know him.

189
00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:02.681
Those evil demons.

190
00:16:03.682 --> 00:16:07.453
This is how foolish people in the outside world are.

191
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.755
Our wishes will be fulfilled. I believe it.

192
00:16:30.409 --> 00:16:32.911
Sir. Are you okay?

193
00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:35.714
Home... I want to go home.

194
00:16:39.952 --> 00:16:42.554
Excuse me. Please wake up.

195
00:16:43.122 --> 00:16:44.690
We have to get out of here.

196
00:17:05.711 --> 00:17:06.712
Excuse me.

197
00:17:06.712 --> 00:17:08.781
Please don't hurt me.

198
00:17:09.315 --> 00:17:13.152
You shouldn't have been born in the first place.

199
00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:15.421
Whenever I see you,

200
00:17:16.055 --> 00:17:20.092
I can feel my rage boiling up, you brat.

201
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.462
You should just die!

202
00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:28.434
Dad.

203
00:17:30.269 --> 00:17:32.805
Why... Why are you here?

204
00:17:34.139 --> 00:17:35.808
Why? Why!

205
00:17:37.209 --> 00:17:40.779
Don't hit me. Please don't hit me.

206
00:17:42.581 --> 00:17:43.749
Dad.

207
00:17:45.484 --> 00:17:49.054
Is this why you couldn't be there when Grandma died?

208
00:17:49.521 --> 00:17:53.559
Please don't kill me. Please.

209
00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:54.560
Please don't kill me.

210
00:18:00.132 --> 00:18:01.400
I am...

211
00:18:02.968 --> 00:18:04.770
never going to forgive you all.

212
00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:09.074
I'm going to kill all of you myself.

213
00:18:16.648 --> 00:18:18.484
Please don't kill me...

214
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:22.388
Please don't kill me...

215
00:18:22.454 --> 00:18:24.723
Please...

216
00:18:32.564 --> 00:18:33.732
Hi, Sang Hwan.

217
00:18:33.732 --> 00:18:35.768
Jung Hoon, do me a favor.

218
00:18:35.768 --> 00:18:36.802
What is it?

219
00:18:36.802 --> 00:18:38.670
I'm on my way to Guseonwon now.

220
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.105
We're going with Dong Cheol's plan.

221
00:18:40.105 --> 00:18:42.941
If you don't hear from me until the morning, report it to the police...

222
00:18:42.941 --> 00:18:44.109
and come to Guseonwon.

223
00:18:44.109 --> 00:18:46.912
No, Sang Hwan. That's not good. Hold on.

224
00:18:46.912 --> 00:18:48.781
Don't go there. Let's just...

225
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:50.849
Let's talk in person. Where are you now?

226
00:18:50.849 --> 00:18:53.819
Jung Hoon, Dong Cheol and Sang Mi are waiting for me now.

227
00:18:53.819 --> 00:18:55.154
- Please do as I said. - Sang Hwan, hang on.

228
00:18:55.154 --> 00:18:56.789
Sang Hwan. Sang Hwan...

229
00:19:09.735 --> 00:19:11.370
Guseonwon's secret funds are...

230
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.272
inside the vault in Spiritual Father's office.

231
00:19:13.472 --> 00:19:15.707
The believers will leave after the morning worship,

232
00:19:15.707 --> 00:19:17.509
so we'll get inside the office then.

233
00:19:17.609 --> 00:19:18.744
Okay?

234
00:19:20.379 --> 00:19:21.513
Almighty.

235
00:19:23.782 --> 00:19:26.018
Guseonwon, the Boat of Salvation, is...

236
00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:30.189
about to sink to the bottom of the sea now.

237
00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.691
Please...

238
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:38.230
do not let this Boat of Salvation sink.

239
00:19:39.631 --> 00:19:42.000
Please protect Guseonwon.

240
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.085
Yes, Almighty.

241
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.855
I will do it.

242
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.158
If you...

243
00:20:07.459 --> 00:20:10.329
use me as the guardian of the Boat of Salvation,

244
00:20:12.498 --> 00:20:16.201
I will change everything here into something new.

245
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.774
I will do that, Almighty.

246
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.105
Mom!

247
00:21:19.464 --> 00:21:22.834
Hey, carry this around you at all times.

248
00:21:23.969 --> 00:21:25.571
- What is this for? - It has...

249
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:27.439
a location-tracking device in it,

250
00:21:27.439 --> 00:21:29.074
so I can see where you are.

251
00:21:29.074 --> 00:21:30.909
If we end up going with your plan,

252
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.179
I can find you without searching around.

253
00:21:35.581 --> 00:21:36.782
Sang Hwan.

254
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.551
Although I'm here,

255
00:21:40.218 --> 00:21:42.120
I'm not worried at all.

256
00:21:43.589 --> 00:21:45.190
I know you will come for me.

257
00:21:47.059 --> 00:21:48.160
I know you will come...

258
00:21:50.228 --> 00:21:52.497
and tell me to stand tall just like before.

259
00:22:02.708 --> 00:22:03.909
Let's go.

260
00:22:06.345 --> 00:22:07.379
Are you feeling okay?

261
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.014
I'm fine.

262
00:22:09.348 --> 00:22:10.482
Let's go.

263
00:22:22.628 --> 00:22:23.829
Sang Mi!

264
00:22:36.708 --> 00:22:38.010
There you are, Sang Mi.

265
00:22:40.112 --> 00:22:42.180
Are you ready to do this now?

266
00:22:43.649 --> 00:22:44.683
Yes.

267
00:22:46.284 --> 00:22:47.953
I will save this place...

268
00:22:49.187 --> 00:22:50.689
no matter what.

269
00:22:52.324 --> 00:22:53.392
Yes.

270
00:23:16.715 --> 00:23:18.183
There is still enough time.

271
00:24:57.749 --> 00:24:59.951
The fire of our Almighty...

272
00:25:00.719 --> 00:25:05.524
will burn away all your sins, and it will...

273
00:25:06.391 --> 00:25:07.759
make you become...

274
00:25:08.794 --> 00:25:10.262
as light as a feather.

275
00:25:10.262 --> 00:25:12.430
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - We believe it!

276
00:25:12.631 --> 00:25:15.133
Those who wish receive the fire of our Almighty,

277
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.768
please stand up.

278
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:21.840
The fire of our Almighty shall be...

279
00:25:22.073 --> 00:25:25.110
generously given to everyone here.

280
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.745
- We believe it! - We believe it!

281
00:25:26.745 --> 00:25:27.779
- Our wishes will be fulfilled! - Our wishes will be fulfilled!

282
00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:31.149
Here is the fire of our Almighty!

283
00:25:32.083 --> 00:25:33.618
Fire!

284
00:25:34.619 --> 00:25:35.821
Fire!

285
00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:38.790
Fire!

286
00:25:56.374 --> 00:25:57.409
Wan Deok.

287
00:25:58.043 --> 00:25:59.211
Let's go.

288
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.075
Dong Cheol.

289
00:26:32.444 --> 00:26:33.879
Dong Cheol!

290
00:26:35.814 --> 00:26:36.982
Dong Cheol!

291
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.584
Sang Hwan.

292
00:26:42.621 --> 00:26:44.489
Sang Hwan! I'm in here!

293
00:26:46.958 --> 00:26:48.260
Sang Hwan!

294
00:26:49.794 --> 00:26:52.230
Sang Hwan! I'm in here!

295
00:26:54.099 --> 00:26:56.101
Sang Hwan! Over here!

296
00:26:57.569 --> 00:26:58.870
Sang Hwan!

297
00:27:09.214 --> 00:27:10.382
Spiritual Mother.

298
00:27:10.849 --> 00:27:13.818
It's time for you to go now.

299
00:27:58.964 --> 00:28:01.199
- Are you okay, Dong Cheol? - Yes, I'm okay.

300
00:28:04.903 --> 00:28:05.971
I can't believe this.

301
00:28:21.553 --> 00:28:23.888
It's me. It's me, Jung Hoon.

302
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.560
Dong Cheol. Dong Cheol, are you okay?

303
00:28:28.793 --> 00:28:30.328
Are you okay? My gosh.

304
00:28:32.263 --> 00:28:33.365
What is this place?

305
00:28:33.498 --> 00:28:35.133
I can't believe this.

306
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.602
Those people that you saw are all here.

307
00:28:37.902 --> 00:28:40.038
You should call the police,

308
00:28:40.338 --> 00:28:42.841
and take everyone here to the hospital.

309
00:28:43.241 --> 00:28:45.110
Okay, okay. What about you guys?

310
00:28:47.278 --> 00:28:48.680
We have to go save Sang Mi.

311
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.584
Okay, leave this place to us. You guys should go.

312
00:28:53.752 --> 00:28:54.919
Okay.

313
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.221
My dad's...

314
00:28:57.489 --> 00:28:58.990
in here as well.

315
00:29:01.092 --> 00:29:02.460
I thought he just left home.

316
00:29:03.294 --> 00:29:04.629
But I guess he was brought here.

317
00:29:07.932 --> 00:29:09.901
Please take good care of him.

318
00:29:11.369 --> 00:29:13.738
Okay. Don't worry.

319
00:29:13.872 --> 00:29:15.373
We'll take good care of him.

320
00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.208
Don't worry.

321
00:29:17.208 --> 00:29:18.309
Let's go.

322
00:29:20.378 --> 00:29:21.980
Be careful, okay?

323
00:29:34.959 --> 00:29:36.728
You and your daughter...

324
00:29:37.362 --> 00:29:39.731
were being controlled by the devil.

325
00:29:42.867 --> 00:29:45.103
That's why these pills never worked on you.

326
00:29:46.871 --> 00:29:49.707
I never should have brought your family here.

327
00:29:51.042 --> 00:29:52.610
You were once a mother yourself.

328
00:29:56.481 --> 00:29:59.050
I heard other people talk about you.

329
00:30:00.919 --> 00:30:02.353
I heard that...

330
00:30:03.588 --> 00:30:05.790
you also had a daughter like Sang Mi.

331
00:30:07.492 --> 00:30:10.261
Do you want Sang Mi to die like your daughter did?

332
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:19.704
If you were once a mother,

333
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.109
please let her go now.

334
00:30:34.552 --> 00:30:35.920
These are your clothes.

335
00:30:36.754 --> 00:30:39.491
You'll be spotted easily with that patient gown on.

336
00:30:40.758 --> 00:30:42.794
So you should change into something else and get out of here.

337
00:30:44.129 --> 00:30:45.530
Your daughter...

338
00:30:46.531 --> 00:30:49.100
will be sleeping with Spiritual Father soon.

339
00:31:03.648 --> 00:31:04.749
Okay.

340
00:31:07.819 --> 00:31:10.822
Let's just burn everything and start all over again.

341
00:31:14.792 --> 00:31:16.828
Then I'll be able to go to paradise...

342
00:31:17.862 --> 00:31:19.330
with my daughter...

343
00:31:20.632 --> 00:31:22.500
and meet our Almighty.

344
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.279
Come in, Sang Mi.

345
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.571
Apostle Im. You may now excuse us and go pray.

346
00:32:00.338 --> 00:32:04.008
Okay. Our wishes will be fulfilled. I believe it.

347
00:32:31.069 --> 00:32:32.670
Do not be afraid.

348
00:32:33.738 --> 00:32:34.939
You will...

349
00:32:36.307 --> 00:32:37.809
also enjoy this.

350
00:33:19.884 --> 00:33:21.452
You devils!

351
00:33:21.719 --> 00:33:23.187
How dare you come here?

352
00:33:23.187 --> 00:33:24.722
Get lost right now!

353
00:33:26.291 --> 00:33:28.960
Sang Hwan, you should go save her.

354
00:33:31.429 --> 00:33:33.431
Okay. I'll go first.

355
00:33:35.733 --> 00:33:36.968
Where do you think you're going?

356
00:34:50.708 --> 00:34:52.410
Don't refuse...

357
00:34:54.278 --> 00:34:56.080
the touch of Almighty.

358
00:35:04.422 --> 00:35:05.790
You devil.

359
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:07.658
Die!

360
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.529
I can't watch this anymore.

361
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:19.170
Dong Cheol.

362
00:35:19.704 --> 00:35:21.239
Let's do some workout, shall we?

363
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.008
You go first.

364
00:35:26.878 --> 00:35:30.148
In order to remove your sin,

365
00:35:31.149 --> 00:35:33.151
you have to share...

366
00:35:33.618 --> 00:35:35.820
both your body and soul with me.

367
00:35:36.254 --> 00:35:38.189
Only then will I...

368
00:35:38.689 --> 00:35:43.528
be able to give you my best spiritual energy.

369
00:35:43.528 --> 00:35:45.763
This is just the way you used to violate women.

370
00:35:45.763 --> 00:35:46.831
With your filthy tongue.

371
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:48.232
Don't try to fight this...

372
00:35:49.033 --> 00:35:51.869
if you do not wish to die...

373
00:35:52.503 --> 00:35:55.273
at such a young and beautiful age...

374
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.842
just like Apostle Kang's daughter, Yu Ra.

375
00:35:57.842 --> 00:35:58.943
How many were there?

376
00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.813
How many people have you killed?

377
00:36:01.813 --> 00:36:03.147
We will all...

378
00:36:04.248 --> 00:36:06.451
meet again in the paradise.

379
00:36:06.851 --> 00:36:08.219
Everyone including Sang Jin...

380
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.988
and Jeong Gu.

381
00:36:11.689 --> 00:36:13.124
Murderer.

382
00:36:14.358 --> 00:36:17.328
You are a murderer!

383
00:36:44.622 --> 00:36:46.224
I'm not too late, am I?

384
00:36:47.358 --> 00:36:48.493
Let's go.

385
00:36:54.732 --> 00:36:55.900
You crazy jerk.

386
00:36:58.803 --> 00:37:00.338
I'm Almighty.

387
00:37:00.738 --> 00:37:02.874
How dare you!

388
00:37:06.344 --> 00:37:07.512
You're a crazy man.

389
00:37:08.379 --> 00:37:10.348
Do you really believe you're Almighty?

390
00:37:11.282 --> 00:37:14.552
You're wrong. You're just a beast.

391
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:20.892
Sang Mi.

392
00:37:21.959 --> 00:37:22.994
Sang Mi!

393
00:37:23.728 --> 00:37:24.729
Mom!

394
00:37:24.729 --> 00:37:26.531
- Sang Mi! - Mom.

395
00:37:27.298 --> 00:37:29.000
Are you okay?

396
00:37:31.168 --> 00:37:33.170
I'm sorry I came too late.

397
00:37:33.237 --> 00:37:35.339
No, Mom. I'm okay.

398
00:37:38.209 --> 00:37:39.210
Are you okay?

399
00:37:41.879 --> 00:37:43.014
Did you get evidence?

400
00:37:48.853 --> 00:37:52.390
The truth of that filthy man is all recorded in here.

401
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.592
I'm going to reveal it now.

402
00:37:55.693 --> 00:37:57.962
Yes. Everything is over now.

403
00:37:58.729 --> 00:38:00.231
Come on. Let's get out of here.

404
00:38:00.231 --> 00:38:01.599
Let's go.

405
00:38:01.699 --> 00:38:02.733
Where do you think you're going?

406
00:38:03.367 --> 00:38:04.502
Sang Mi!

407
00:38:06.571 --> 00:38:07.939
Come on. Let's get out of here.

408
00:38:08.739 --> 00:38:09.840
Where do you think you're going?

409
00:38:10.408 --> 00:38:11.509
Sang Mi!

410
00:38:14.011 --> 00:38:15.346
Put that knife down.

411
00:38:16.581 --> 00:38:18.516
You can never get out of here.

412
00:38:18.516 --> 00:38:20.618
Sang Mi. Sang Mi!

413
00:38:20.651 --> 00:38:22.753
- Mom. - Move. I said, move!

414
00:38:22.954 --> 00:38:24.121
Sang Mi!

415
00:38:24.121 --> 00:38:25.489
Mom, don't come closer.

416
00:38:31.062 --> 00:38:32.463
Do not follow us.

417
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:33.998
If you do...

418
00:38:37.835 --> 00:38:38.936
Sang Mi...

419
00:38:40.504 --> 00:38:41.505
Ms. Kim.

420
00:38:41.505 --> 00:38:43.074
I'll take care of her. Go.

421
00:38:43.074 --> 00:38:44.108
Make sure she's okay.

422
00:38:45.977 --> 00:38:48.045
Ms. Kim, are you all right?

423
00:38:53.784 --> 00:38:55.019
Apostle Kang.

424
00:39:03.127 --> 00:39:04.261
Apostle Kang.

425
00:39:05.196 --> 00:39:06.230
What are you...

426
00:39:07.131 --> 00:39:08.499
doing right now?

427
00:39:09.634 --> 00:39:13.204
This is the divine message Almighty sent me.

428
00:39:14.205 --> 00:39:16.974
I heard a clear and distinct voice.

429
00:39:17.241 --> 00:39:20.378
I will burn down every filthy sin in this place...

430
00:39:21.679 --> 00:39:23.381
and start anew.

431
00:39:27.118 --> 00:39:28.953
Have you lost your mind?

432
00:39:44.735 --> 00:39:46.103
I'm Almighty.

433
00:39:47.271 --> 00:39:48.606
How dare you.

434
00:39:55.379 --> 00:39:56.681
Sang Mi.

435
00:40:03.788 --> 00:40:05.056
Almighty will...

436
00:40:06.023 --> 00:40:07.992
turn this place into a new one.

437
00:40:14.665 --> 00:40:15.700
What...

438
00:40:17.334 --> 00:40:18.636
are you doing?

439
00:40:18.636 --> 00:40:19.804
I will...

440
00:40:22.506 --> 00:40:24.241
burn down this filthy place.

441
00:40:25.009 --> 00:40:26.143
Sang Mi.

442
00:40:26.143 --> 00:40:27.211
What?

443
00:40:28.245 --> 00:40:29.380
Are you afraid?

444
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.882
I... I'm sorry.

445
00:40:33.217 --> 00:40:34.418
Forgive me.

446
00:40:35.319 --> 00:40:36.387
No.

447
00:40:38.055 --> 00:40:39.590
You deserve to die.

448
00:40:40.357 --> 00:40:41.559
Die...

449
00:40:42.326 --> 00:40:43.994
and fall into the fire pit!

450
00:40:44.195 --> 00:40:45.362
Sang Mi!

451
00:40:47.965 --> 00:40:49.166
Don't do that.

452
00:40:49.967 --> 00:40:51.202
If you do,

453
00:40:52.169 --> 00:40:53.771
you will become a murderer.

454
00:40:55.172 --> 00:40:56.240
No.

455
00:40:58.743 --> 00:40:59.810
I will...

456
00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:04.115
end his life myself no matter what.

457
00:41:06.517 --> 00:41:07.852
Didn't you tell me...

458
00:41:09.153 --> 00:41:11.322
you would get out of this horrible place...

459
00:41:11.322 --> 00:41:13.090
and go back to the world outside?

460
00:41:13.357 --> 00:41:14.558
Let's let him...

461
00:41:15.459 --> 00:41:16.827
be judged by the law.

462
00:41:18.362 --> 00:41:19.430
I am...

463
00:41:20.064 --> 00:41:21.532
I am Almighty.

464
00:41:24.602 --> 00:41:27.972
I have eternal life. I am immortal!

465
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.086
It's dangerous. Let's get out of here.

466
00:41:46.257 --> 00:41:48.225
Help me!

467
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.568
No!

468
00:41:58.836 --> 00:41:59.937
No!

469
00:42:08.846 --> 00:42:09.880
Are you okay?

470
00:42:13.984 --> 00:42:15.352
It's all over now.

471
00:42:16.453 --> 00:42:17.555
Finally,

472
00:42:19.023 --> 00:42:21.292
the time that felt like a nightmare is over.

473
00:42:21.926 --> 00:42:23.160
You've been strong.

474
00:42:26.263 --> 00:42:27.464
Can you walk?

475
00:42:29.466 --> 00:42:30.501
Yes.

476
00:42:31.569 --> 00:42:33.204
I will...

477
00:42:34.104 --> 00:42:35.940
walk out of here by myself proudly.

478
00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:48.052
This place became a total mess while I was gone.

479
00:43:07.304 --> 00:43:09.206
This is the paradise.

480
00:43:17.214 --> 00:43:20.050
Those evil devils. I'm going to kill them.

481
00:43:20.985 --> 00:43:23.354
Sang Mi. Spiritual Father.

482
00:43:23.387 --> 00:43:25.623
No. No!

483
00:43:37.134 --> 00:43:38.636
Listen to it and decide for yourself.

484
00:43:39.236 --> 00:43:40.237
My dad...

485
00:43:40.905 --> 00:43:41.972
I mean,

486
00:43:42.573 --> 00:43:44.942
the governor of Muji-gun. This will tell you everything...

487
00:43:45.209 --> 00:43:48.312
about the relationship between him and the cult leader.

488
00:43:49.847 --> 00:43:51.515
What if it's a complete waste of time again?

489
00:43:51.649 --> 00:43:55.085
And we'll get in trouble if Chief finds out about this.

490
00:43:55.319 --> 00:43:56.720
Shut it, you idiot.

491
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.155
Hey, drive faster.

492
00:43:58.255 --> 00:44:00.324
- You devils! - Go away!

493
00:44:00.691 --> 00:44:02.893
- Go away! - Leave our premises!

494
00:44:03.193 --> 00:44:05.396
- How dare you set foot here? - Get out of our premises!

495
00:44:05.863 --> 00:44:07.898
- Go away! - Get lost!

496
00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:11.936
- Almighty will punish you all. - Go away!

497
00:44:12.036 --> 00:44:13.837
- All right. Make way, please. - Go away!

498
00:44:14.138 --> 00:44:16.040
- Move out of our way! - Get lost!

499
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.841
How dare you set foot on these grounds?

500
00:44:17.875 --> 00:44:19.743
Spiritual Father is Almighty.

501
00:44:19.743 --> 00:44:21.545
- Go away, you devils! - Go away!

502
00:44:21.645 --> 00:44:23.147
Why are you guys just standing? Arrest them!

503
00:44:23.147 --> 00:44:25.115
- Make way! - Go away!

504
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:26.450
How dare you!

505
00:44:31.221 --> 00:44:32.990
- My gosh. - Who is he?

506
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:34.224
For goodness' sake.

507
00:44:34.491 --> 00:44:39.096
Aren't you believers of Almighty? Why are you acting like hoodlums?

508
00:44:40.764 --> 00:44:42.232
- Get that jerk. - Yes, let's go.

509
00:44:43.567 --> 00:44:45.235
- Get him! - Stop right there!

510
00:44:47.905 --> 00:44:49.573
- Stop! - Go away!

511
00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:00.651
No.

512
00:45:01.118 --> 00:45:03.821
My daughter must become Spiritual Mother.

513
00:45:04.521 --> 00:45:07.124
She must. I ought to make her become Spiritual Mother.

514
00:45:12.262 --> 00:45:14.498
- What about Sang Mi? - She'll be okay.

515
00:45:19.269 --> 00:45:21.638
Gosh, you rat. Dong Cheol.

516
00:45:22.406 --> 00:45:24.274
My life has become a mess because of you guys.

517
00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:26.410
You must be ready for the consequences.

518
00:45:28.178 --> 00:45:29.480
What should we do?

519
00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.848
Please don't worry.

520
00:45:31.682 --> 00:45:33.317
Stay right behind me, okay?

521
00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:34.752
Wan Deok.

522
00:45:54.338 --> 00:45:55.472
Dong Cheol!

523
00:46:02.346 --> 00:46:03.714
You rats ruined everything.

524
00:46:04.448 --> 00:46:05.849
Because of you punks...

525
00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:09.720
You jerks. It's all your fault.

526
00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.588
Hey, Mr. Curly Hair.

527
00:46:14.458 --> 00:46:15.726
Mr. Gatekeeper.

528
00:46:16.427 --> 00:46:17.561
Mom.

529
00:46:18.662 --> 00:46:21.698
I told you to never trust anybody.

530
00:46:21.899 --> 00:46:24.034
You guys are surely friends. You're like two peas in a pod.

531
00:46:25.569 --> 00:46:28.939
Hey, aren't you embarrassed that you're fighting with kids?

532
00:46:29.339 --> 00:46:30.874
How about a showdown with me?

533
00:46:31.642 --> 00:46:32.676
Mr. Curly Hair.

534
00:46:45.122 --> 00:46:46.690
- You piece of... - Jerk!

535
00:46:56.834 --> 00:46:57.868
You little...

536
00:47:11.415 --> 00:47:13.350
Jerk! You piece of...

537
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:16.487
You scum. Get a taste of this, jerk!

538
00:47:17.087 --> 00:47:19.990
You rats got me into this mess!

539
00:47:25.395 --> 00:47:28.832
I warned you not to act up, you scumbag.

540
00:47:54.725 --> 00:47:56.460
Gosh, those crazy pagans.

541
00:47:56.727 --> 00:47:58.228
They sure are persistent.

542
00:47:59.796 --> 00:48:01.198
Bring it on.

543
00:48:25.856 --> 00:48:27.591
Is it you, Apostle Jo?

544
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:35.399
Oh, look who's here.

545
00:48:37.134 --> 00:48:38.869
Sergeant Woo, it's you.

546
00:48:40.504 --> 00:48:43.907
What happened to you? What are you doing here?

547
00:48:46.443 --> 00:48:47.844
I must say,

548
00:48:48.178 --> 00:48:51.415
I think Almighty loves me very much.

549
00:48:52.149 --> 00:48:55.852
Who would've thought I'd run into you here?

550
00:48:56.587 --> 00:49:00.057
Please... Help me. Hurry, let's get out of here.

551
00:49:00.324 --> 00:49:02.626
I asked you what you're doing here.

552
00:49:04.294 --> 00:49:06.697
I hope you're not trying to flee alone.

553
00:49:10.934 --> 00:49:12.936
What are you doing now?

554
00:49:21.812 --> 00:49:24.448
You stay out. I'll take care of this.

555
00:49:35.926 --> 00:49:36.994
Wait.

556
00:49:50.974 --> 00:49:52.342
Do you think...

557
00:49:52.676 --> 00:49:54.945
that nothing will happen to you if I get arrested?

558
00:49:55.212 --> 00:49:58.915
You'll be doomed too. You got that?

559
00:50:01.418 --> 00:50:04.388
Those who have sinned must be punished.

560
00:50:14.498 --> 00:50:15.632
Officer Choi.

561
00:50:16.133 --> 00:50:17.634
Arrest both of us.

562
00:50:18.902 --> 00:50:21.338
- Sorry? - Didn't you hear me? Arrest us!

563
00:50:27.144 --> 00:50:28.445
Come on.

564
00:50:42.392 --> 00:50:43.527
No.

565
00:50:48.465 --> 00:50:49.833
Apostle Kang.

566
00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:54.938
A new chapter has begun.

567
00:50:56.073 --> 00:50:57.107
Sorry?

568
00:51:01.578 --> 00:51:03.714
This was what Almighty wanted.

569
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:07.718
Yes, Almighty.

570
00:51:08.919 --> 00:51:10.153
I'll rise again...

571
00:51:10.854 --> 00:51:14.424
and spread your word to the entire world.

572
00:51:19.129 --> 00:51:21.698
Will we really be able to rise again?

573
00:51:25.435 --> 00:51:26.703
Of course.

574
00:51:28.939 --> 00:51:30.807
- Come on! - Let go of us!

575
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.014
Dong Cheol.

576
00:51:38.548 --> 00:51:41.151
Take care of the rest for me. I need to find my mom.

577
00:51:41.351 --> 00:51:43.653
All right. I know that you'll find her, Sang Hwan.

578
00:51:45.422 --> 00:51:46.590
Just a second.

579
00:51:47.257 --> 00:51:49.359
Is your name Han Sang Hwan?

580
00:51:51.495 --> 00:51:52.529
Yes.

581
00:51:54.164 --> 00:51:55.232
Han...

582
00:51:55.632 --> 00:51:59.136
- Sang... Hwan. - Sang?

583
00:51:59.836 --> 00:52:02.706
Is your mother ill by any chance?

584
00:52:06.176 --> 00:52:08.412
Are you the one who called me?

585
00:52:08.745 --> 00:52:11.615
Yes, it was me. I'll show you where your mom is.

586
00:52:18.422 --> 00:52:20.857
- I'll get going. - All right. I'll see you later.

587
00:52:21.458 --> 00:52:22.659
Sang Hwan.

588
00:52:30.534 --> 00:52:31.701
Thanks.

589
00:52:32.936 --> 00:52:35.205
Had you not heard what I said...

590
00:52:36.106 --> 00:52:39.609
in the van that day, I would've fallen apart a long time ago.

591
00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.981
Save me.

592
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:54.124
What a surprise. I didn't think you'd ever thank me.

593
00:52:56.526 --> 00:52:57.661
See you later.

594
00:53:16.112 --> 00:53:18.381
- Mom. - Yes?

595
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:21.351
If an omnipotent being...

596
00:53:21.818 --> 00:53:23.587
really exists up there,

597
00:53:24.421 --> 00:53:26.189
he'll be sure to punish them, right?

598
00:53:28.492 --> 00:53:29.526
Of course.

599
00:53:31.094 --> 00:53:33.563
He will definitely answer our prayers.

600
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:40.470
In mountains in Muji-gun, North Gyeongsang Province,

601
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:43.707
many dead bodies have been found, and the news has left many in shock.

602
00:53:43.707 --> 00:53:47.377
They're speculated to have been buried by a religious organization,

603
00:53:47.511 --> 00:53:50.647
and wounds that could have been caused by assault have been found,

604
00:53:50.647 --> 00:53:53.917
so it looks like the police will carry out autopsies.

605
00:53:55.051 --> 00:53:57.821
My father, Governor Han Yong Min,

606
00:53:58.855 --> 00:54:00.924
colluded with a religious cult...

607
00:54:01.258 --> 00:54:02.993
and tried to build a sanitarium...

608
00:54:03.593 --> 00:54:05.529
in order to obtain and launder illegal funds.

609
00:54:06.796 --> 00:54:08.832
Also, in order to conceal his corrupt deeds,

610
00:54:09.232 --> 00:54:11.434
on June 29, 2016,

611
00:54:14.504 --> 00:54:15.705
he pushed my mother,

612
00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.609
Chae Min Hwa, down a mountain hill...

613
00:54:20.644 --> 00:54:22.812
in an attempt to kill her.

614
00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:27.684
I would like to take this chance to report my father,

615
00:54:29.219 --> 00:54:31.154
Governor Han Yong Min,

616
00:54:33.223 --> 00:54:35.659
- to the police. - How do you feel now?

617
00:54:35.659 --> 00:54:37.027
Don't worry.

618
00:54:37.027 --> 00:54:38.795
Things will quiet down very soon.

619
00:54:39.362 --> 00:54:42.632
You should hire lawyers first so that we can...

620
00:54:42.632 --> 00:54:44.167
This must be the end.

621
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:55.645
I wanted to see how high you can go up,

622
00:54:57.113 --> 00:54:59.382
but I ended up seeing you fall hard instead.

623
00:55:00.317 --> 00:55:01.384
Ji Hee.

624
00:55:10.994 --> 00:55:12.462
You should get going.

625
00:55:18.902 --> 00:55:20.170
Please come with us, Mr. Han.

626
00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:47.197
There he is! He's coming!

627
00:55:47.197 --> 00:55:48.898
- There he is. - He's here.

628
00:55:48.932 --> 00:55:50.000
He's here.

629
00:55:50.834 --> 00:55:54.204
Sir, do you admit that you attempted to murder your wife?

630
00:55:54.204 --> 00:55:56.339
Do you admit that you colluded with a religious cult?

631
00:55:56.339 --> 00:55:58.675
A reporter who was working on a story about them was murdered.

632
00:55:58.675 --> 00:56:00.076
Please say a few words.

633
00:56:00.477 --> 00:56:04.981
I will answer all questions in detail in court.

634
00:56:04.981 --> 00:56:06.616
- How do you feel now? - Say a few words.

635
00:56:06.616 --> 00:56:08.551
- Sir, please say a few words. - Sir!

636
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.561
Hello, Senator Choi.

637
00:56:19.162 --> 00:56:20.664
It's me, Lee Ji Hee.

638
00:56:27.103 --> 00:56:28.438
How have you been?

639
00:56:29.973 --> 00:56:33.109
I'm thinking of moving back to Yeouido.

640
00:56:33.476 --> 00:56:35.445
If you have some time...

641
00:56:36.546 --> 00:56:38.982
Ms. Lee, where do you think you're going?

642
00:56:40.183 --> 00:56:41.184
Sorry?

643
00:56:41.184 --> 00:56:42.719
You need to be interviewed as a witness.

644
00:56:42.719 --> 00:56:44.688
You were in the same boat with Mr. Han, you know.

645
00:56:47.057 --> 00:56:50.293
Sir, I'll call you back in a bit.

646
00:56:55.432 --> 00:56:58.134
Go on. I'll follow you.

647
00:57:04.641 --> 00:57:06.076
- There he is. - It must be him.

648
00:57:12.382 --> 00:57:14.484
Sir, how do you feel now?

649
00:57:15.218 --> 00:57:16.252
Please say a few words.

650
00:57:16.252 --> 00:57:18.421
- Please say a few words! - Are the allegations true?

651
00:57:18.421 --> 00:57:19.723
Sir!

652
00:57:19.723 --> 00:57:21.458
- We love you - We love you

653
00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:22.992
- Almighty - Almighty

654
00:57:22.992 --> 00:57:24.260
- Spiritual Father gives us joy - Spiritual Father gives us joy

655
00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:26.996
Do you really believe that your leader is still alive?

656
00:57:26.996 --> 00:57:28.498
How dare you!

657
00:57:28.498 --> 00:57:31.267
- I saw it with my own two eyes. - That's right.

658
00:57:31.434 --> 00:57:35.605
Spiritual Father ascended to the sky in a big whiff of smoke.

659
00:57:35.605 --> 00:57:37.907
He even waved his hand at me like this.

660
00:57:37.907 --> 00:57:39.642
I know that he'll be resurrected.

661
00:57:39.642 --> 00:57:42.412
Totally. Look at this. This is...

662
00:57:42.412 --> 00:57:44.247
his autograph.

663
00:57:44.247 --> 00:57:45.515
Salvation and immortal life.

664
00:57:45.515 --> 00:57:47.417
He'll be resurrected and return to us!

665
00:57:47.417 --> 00:57:48.518
That's right!

666
00:57:48.518 --> 00:57:51.688
You devils. If you look down on us,

667
00:57:51.688 --> 00:57:54.457
three generations of your family will end up in the fiery pit!

668
00:57:54.457 --> 00:57:56.626
His grace and kindness saved us.

669
00:57:56.626 --> 00:57:59.796
- He never duped us! - Exactly!

670
00:57:59.796 --> 00:58:00.930
She's absolutely right.

671
00:58:01.965 --> 00:58:09.873
- Spiritual Father gives me joy - Spiritual Father gives me joy

672
00:58:09.873 --> 00:58:12.408
- I love you, Almighty - I love you, Almighty

673
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:16.613
All of you survived...

674
00:58:17.413 --> 00:58:19.616
the Day of Judgment because...

675
00:58:20.083 --> 00:58:21.918
you were chosen by Almighty.

676
00:58:22.652 --> 00:58:23.920
Do you all believe it?

677
00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.822
- We believe it. - We believe it.

678
00:58:26.823 --> 00:58:27.824
"Ask,"

679
00:58:28.124 --> 00:58:30.260
"and you shall receive."

680
00:58:30.293 --> 00:58:31.594
"Seek,"

681
00:58:31.694 --> 00:58:33.463
"and you shall find the answer."

682
00:58:33.463 --> 00:58:34.831
"Knock,"

683
00:58:34.831 --> 00:58:36.733
"and the door will open."

684
00:58:36.733 --> 00:58:38.334
All those who ask shall receive,

685
00:58:38.334 --> 00:58:40.370
all those who seek will find the answer,

686
00:58:40.436 --> 00:58:42.872
and the door will open for all those who knock.

687
00:58:43.373 --> 00:58:44.808
So far, we've been...

688
00:58:45.041 --> 00:58:48.545
trying to find a way to make the Boat of Salvation float again...

689
00:58:48.545 --> 00:58:51.447
by asking and praying to Almighty with all of our hearts...

690
00:58:51.447 --> 00:58:53.516
to find the answer.

691
00:58:54.484 --> 00:58:57.587
And finally, Almighty...

692
00:58:57.587 --> 00:59:01.758
spoke clearly to me.

693
00:59:02.125 --> 00:59:03.726
He told me...

694
00:59:03.893 --> 00:59:07.163
that this place will become Guseonwon's new sanctuary.

695
00:59:07.363 --> 00:59:08.965
Do you all believe it?

696
00:59:09.232 --> 00:59:12.001
- We believe it, Spiritual Mother! - We believe it, Spiritual Mother!

697
00:59:13.603 --> 00:59:16.773
(Im Sang Jin, August 2, 1998 - March 10, 2014)

698
00:59:16.773 --> 00:59:17.874
Sang Jin.

699
00:59:19.709 --> 00:59:21.711
I'll never become weak like that again.

700
00:59:23.479 --> 00:59:25.248
Sang Mi and I will try to live our lives to the fullest,

701
00:59:28.151 --> 00:59:32.155
so you should rest in peace now.

702
00:59:36.759 --> 00:59:37.961
Sang Jin.

703
00:59:39.796 --> 00:59:43.533
Mom and I want to be happy now...

704
00:59:44.467 --> 00:59:45.535
so that...

705
00:59:46.936 --> 00:59:49.205
you don't have to worry about us...

706
00:59:49.672 --> 00:59:52.775
and smile in the real paradise.

707
01:00:07.757 --> 01:00:09.158
Bye, Son.

708
01:00:33.583 --> 01:00:35.218
Have you eaten yet?

709
01:00:38.988 --> 01:00:40.189
What about you?

710
01:00:41.791 --> 01:00:42.825
Not yet.

711
01:00:46.262 --> 01:00:47.530
Do you want to eat jjajangmyeon?

712
01:00:52.168 --> 01:00:53.169
Sure.

713
01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:57.674
My dad and I will challenge ourselves and see if we can do this.

714
01:00:57.674 --> 01:00:58.675
In how many minutes?

715
01:00:58.675 --> 01:01:02.078
All right. If we finish this in five minutes, we don't have to pay.

716
01:01:02.078 --> 01:01:03.680
- Do you think you can do it? - Yes, sure.

717
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.681
- Will you be okay? - Of course.

718
01:01:04.681 --> 01:01:06.516
Then before we pick up our chopsticks,

719
01:01:06.516 --> 01:01:08.217
we should drink this to protect our stomachs.

720
01:01:08.284 --> 01:01:09.953
- Cheers. - Cheers.

721
01:01:10.353 --> 01:01:11.688
All right, here we go.

722
01:01:12.322 --> 01:01:13.523
Start!

723
01:01:17.126 --> 01:01:18.995
Gosh, it's so spicy!

724
01:01:25.568 --> 01:01:28.538
Look at this idiot. I'm out.

725
01:01:28.538 --> 01:01:29.939
My mouth is on fire!

726
01:01:38.614 --> 01:01:41.985
Goodness, why is this beer so bland?

727
01:01:44.554 --> 01:01:45.621
Here.

728
01:01:46.322 --> 01:01:48.591
Goodness, cut it out.

729
01:01:48.891 --> 01:01:49.892
Come on.

730
01:01:52.395 --> 01:01:54.063
- Me? - Yes.

731
01:01:59.102 --> 01:02:00.603
Make sure you chew well.

732
01:02:01.337 --> 01:02:05.975
My gosh, what on earth has gotten into you two?

733
01:02:06.209 --> 01:02:09.112
Pil Soo, this guy can be so sweet like this.

734
01:02:09.112 --> 01:02:10.246
Aren't I right?

735
01:02:10.246 --> 01:02:11.681
Okay, I heard you.

736
01:02:12.315 --> 01:02:13.516
Eat up.

737
01:02:14.283 --> 01:02:16.419
Joon Gu, you should try this too.

738
01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.461
- Drink up, guys. - You too, Joon Gu.

739
01:02:25.461 --> 01:02:27.196
- Let's do this. - All right, cheers.

740
01:02:27.196 --> 01:02:28.364
Cheers.

741
01:02:29.165 --> 01:02:34.237
- I'll see you all soon. - All right.

742
01:02:34.704 --> 01:02:37.774
Sang Hwan, what you need in order to thrive here isn't your brain...

743
01:02:37.774 --> 01:02:39.976
but your guts. You know that, right?

744
01:02:39.976 --> 01:02:41.010
Is that right?

745
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.312
Is that why you got fired from the courier service?

746
01:02:43.413 --> 01:02:46.049
I hope you're not proud of that. You need to use your brain.

747
01:02:46.149 --> 01:02:47.650
You little...

748
01:02:48.851 --> 01:02:50.653
Sang Hwan, Sang Hwan.

749
01:02:50.653 --> 01:02:54.090
Gosh, my eyes are welling up with tears.

750
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:56.993
When he was a toddler, I changed his diapers...

751
01:02:56.993 --> 01:02:58.428
and fed him.

752
01:02:58.428 --> 01:03:00.863
- I even carried him around... - Isn't your enlistment next week?

753
01:03:00.863 --> 01:03:03.199
Shut it! I want to pause time.

754
01:03:03.199 --> 01:03:04.700
Time will keep flowing.

755
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:09.572
Make sure you don't skip meals, okay?

756
01:03:09.572 --> 01:03:10.840
Don't you worry.

757
01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.076
You should try to eat less, okay?

758
01:03:17.713 --> 01:03:19.916
I should go in now. Here, guys.

759
01:03:21.317 --> 01:03:22.552
Good luck.

760
01:03:22.985 --> 01:03:24.053
See you soon.

761
01:03:24.053 --> 01:03:25.188
I'll follow you soon.

762
01:03:25.855 --> 01:03:27.190
I'll see you guys soon.

763
01:03:57.487 --> 01:03:58.588
Has everything been well?

764
01:04:02.558 --> 01:04:05.394
You'll visit us too, right?

765
01:04:06.596 --> 01:04:08.931
We're all friends, you know.

766
01:04:11.601 --> 01:04:12.702
Yes.

767
01:04:21.043 --> 01:04:22.512
People ask me...

768
01:04:22.945 --> 01:04:26.115
how I was able to hold out at a place like that.

769
01:04:27.183 --> 01:04:30.686
The hope that I'll be able to get out of there one day.

770
01:04:31.721 --> 01:04:35.658
The hope that the real omnipotent being must be watching over us.

771
01:04:37.026 --> 01:04:39.262
The hope that someone will answer...

772
01:04:40.062 --> 01:04:42.431
upon hearing my desperate cry.

773
01:04:43.466 --> 01:04:46.435
Such hopes are what got me through those days.

774
01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:49.305
I believe...

775
01:04:50.039 --> 01:04:53.809
that such hopes still exist in this world.

776
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:43.526
(Save Me)

777
01:05:43.759 --> 01:05:46.662
Almighty is the king and the creator of the paradise.

778
01:05:46.929 --> 01:05:48.631
You must believe Almighty!

779
01:05:48.965 --> 01:05:51.067
The day of judgment is coming.

780
01:05:51.133 --> 01:05:54.103
All of us must pray and repent our sins.

781
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:57.573
This world is filled with evil souls.

782
01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:59.742
You must believe Almighty.

783
01:05:59.742 --> 01:06:02.645
Spiritual Father is still alive.

784
01:06:02.745 --> 01:06:04.714
Pray and repent your sins.

785
01:06:04.714 --> 01:06:07.683
The day of judgment is just around the corner.

786
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:10.119
The day of salvation is near.

787
01:06:10.553 --> 01:06:12.421
I'm certain that Spiritual Father...

788
01:06:12.788 --> 01:06:15.258
will return to us!
