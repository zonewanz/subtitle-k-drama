00:00:10.898 --> 00:00:12.867
(Episode 17)

2
00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:21.508
Are you coming back to work today?

3
00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:23.137
How is your mother?

4
00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:24.808
How much do you like Eun Jae?

5
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:27.422
If you like her, be careful.

6
00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:30.392
I might try to steal her from you.

7
00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:52.642
What a typical development of situation.

8
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:54.681
A love triangle?

9
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:56.611
Between you and that intimidating Dr. Song?

10
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:58.611
You have such peculiar tastes in women.

11
00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:01.852
While we're on this subject, let's spill the truth.

12
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:05.422
- How much do you like her? - Answer carefully.

13
00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:07.821
Make yourself clear, or you might lose her to me.

14
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:10.392
Gosh, don't be so scary.

15
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:12.732
- She's not even your type. - She's not.

16
00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:14.361
Why are you doing this then?

17
00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:16.672
I'd like to know the reason.

18
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:18.831
She knows when to sacrifice herself.

19
00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:20.471
That sounds rather grim.

20
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.441
Eun Jae saved my mom's life.

21
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:27.381
You repay a favor with your life in the world of chivalry.

22
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:28.982
Speak in plain language.

23
00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:33.422
What I'm saying is, if you ever make...

24
00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:35.622
Eun Jae cry because of Ms. Choi,

25
00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:38.252
I will take her from you by all means...

26
00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:40.491
even if it makes me bleed to death.

27
00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:43.461
Why?

28
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:46.062
Why would it make you bleed to death?

29
00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:47.961
- I might die. - Die?

30
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:49.661
If I flirt with her...

31
00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:52.471
and she chases me with a scalpel, I might die.

32
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:54.441
You silly man. Do you even know how to flirt?

33
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:57.672
Of course. I'm a grown man.

34
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:03.881
I guess you should try harder. Don't you lose Dr. Song to him.

35
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:06.851
Love shouldn't be that grim.

36
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.481
Good luck.

37
00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:11.492
Thanks.

38
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:27.772
Did you push me away...

39
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:29.402
because of Dr. Song?

40
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:32.712
Is it her?

41
00:02:32.712 --> 00:02:34.641
Eavesdropping isn't a good habit.

42
00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:38.511
I guess it's really her. Give her up, and come back to me.

43
00:02:39.112 --> 00:02:42.221
You will never be able to have her.

44
00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:45.622
What do you mean?

45
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:48.862
I heard that...

46
00:02:48.862 --> 00:02:51.391
you were the last doctor her mother saw before she died.

47
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:54.661
Her mother died because of you.

48
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:56.971
- Ms. Choi. - You could've saved her.

49
00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:58.601
- Choi Young Eun. - It's Eun Jae.

50
00:02:58.832 --> 00:03:01.902
She would think of it that way, not me.

51
00:03:03.612 --> 00:03:06.112
If it were your mother, would you be able to love...

52
00:03:06.712 --> 00:03:09.082
the doctor who let your mother die?

53
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:36.101
Song Jae Joon, your dad...

54
00:03:37.242 --> 00:03:38.712
If we can't find him,

55
00:03:38.712 --> 00:03:40.641
you have to repay his debt.

56
00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:43.951
Of course. I heard you were a doctor.

57
00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:47.652
If you can't pay us back,

58
00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:50.821
you should take out an organ from your body and sell it.

59
00:03:51.622 --> 00:03:54.221
If you can't do that yourself, I can do it for you.

60
00:03:59.191 --> 00:04:00.462
We'll be back.

61
00:04:01.761 --> 00:04:03.701
See you around.

62
00:04:05.872 --> 00:04:08.441
- Let's go. - Come on.

63
00:04:08.772 --> 00:04:10.372
- Let's go. - Who are they?

64
00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:12.671
Why do you care?

65
00:04:12.842 --> 00:04:15.342
Don't answer if you don't want to. I'll ask them myself.

66
00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:17.752
Let go of me.

67
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:24.021
Who are they?

68
00:04:24.552 --> 00:04:26.562
Why were they so rude to you?

69
00:04:26.562 --> 00:04:28.821
Who they are is none of your business.

70
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:32.292
So don't poke your nose into my problems.

71
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:43.972
I can't do that.

72
00:04:44.912 --> 00:04:46.542
Tell me who they are.

73
00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:48.912
- I don't want to. - Are they a patient's family?

74
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:51.112
Nothing happened on the ship.

75
00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:53.951
- Was there a problem in the ER? - No.

76
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:55.781
- Then what? - I won't answer.

77
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:56.792
Just answer.

78
00:04:57.021 --> 00:04:58.122
So I can help.

79
00:04:58.591 --> 00:04:59.622
Why?

80
00:04:59.992 --> 00:05:01.362
Why would you help me?

81
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:05.631
I told you we're colleagues. Nothing more, nothing less.

82
00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:09.631
So unless it's about work, I don't need your help.

83
00:05:11.002 --> 00:05:13.201
Why are you trying so hard to push me away?

84
00:05:14.502 --> 00:05:17.271
- Is it because I'm a colleague? - No.

85
00:05:17.542 --> 00:05:19.341
Are you bothered about Ms. Choi?

86
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:21.441
If so, I can explain.

87
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:23.112
Are you a narcissist?

88
00:05:24.081 --> 00:05:26.752
- Are you that sure of yourself? - Is that not it?

89
00:05:26.922 --> 00:05:29.052
I'm busy, so please leave.

90
00:05:29.352 --> 00:05:30.391
If not...

91
00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:33.922
If that's not it,

92
00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:35.662
is it about your mom?

93
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:39.191
Because I couldn't save her?

94
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:44.901
Isn't that obvious?

95
00:05:46.372 --> 00:05:47.701
If you were me,

96
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:50.372
would you be able to...

97
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:52.042
not hate me?

98
00:06:55.302 --> 00:06:56.641
(Woo Jae)

99
00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:01.312
(Woo Jae)

100
00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:04.211
What is it?

101
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:05.912
Hi, it's me.

102
00:07:05.912 --> 00:07:07.451
I know it's you. What is it?

103
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:12.292
Can you wire me just 500 dollars more?

104
00:07:12.622 --> 00:07:14.761
I wired your allowance just two weeks ago.

105
00:07:14.922 --> 00:07:18.292
It's the start of the term, and I need to spend some extra.

106
00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:21.362
I'm not a bank. Get your money elsewhere.

107
00:07:21.362 --> 00:07:23.472
Please, Eun Jae.

108
00:07:23.872 --> 00:07:25.602
Shall I cut you off next month?

109
00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:28.401
Anyway,

110
00:07:29.602 --> 00:07:31.141
did someone come see you?

111
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:36.982
What? Creditors asked you about Dad?

112
00:07:38.881 --> 00:07:41.682
Are you sure Dad's in Korea?

113
00:07:41.821 --> 00:07:42.881
Yes.

114
00:07:43.552 --> 00:07:46.662
Call me right away if you hear something. Okay?

115
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:49.321
Hang up then.

116
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.331
Woo Jae.

117
00:07:53.102 --> 00:07:54.802
I'll wire you 300 tomorrow.

118
00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:56.771
Just this month.

119
00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:58.672
Spend it wisely.

120
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.562
What?

121
00:08:22.162 --> 00:08:23.761
What did she say?

122
00:08:23.761 --> 00:08:26.162
I think she knows you're in Korea.

123
00:08:27.602 --> 00:08:28.602
What?

124
00:08:35.702 --> 00:08:36.972
What are you doing?

125
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:38.641
I have to leave.

126
00:08:39.342 --> 00:08:41.442
Your sister scares me more than...

127
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:43.411
the creditors or the cops.

128
00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:46.582
Where do you think you can go?

129
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:48.881
Get out of my way.

130
00:08:49.122 --> 00:08:51.122
Wait. Let's get something to eat.

131
00:08:51.852 --> 00:08:54.462
If you have to leave, at least eat first.

132
00:08:56.021 --> 00:08:57.692
You look hungry.

133
00:09:03.232 --> 00:09:05.631
The hospital ship is here.

134
00:09:05.732 --> 00:09:09.641
We have nice people and good medicine.

135
00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:13.482
You're shaking out sesame seeds. Hi, are you drying garlic?

136
00:09:13.781 --> 00:09:16.411
You're drying out your nets. How are you?

137
00:09:17.781 --> 00:09:19.281
Hello, everyone.

138
00:09:19.452 --> 00:09:22.281
Where are you going, ma'am?

139
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:24.752
Can't you see where I'm going?

140
00:09:24.752 --> 00:09:25.952
I see you.

141
00:09:26.092 --> 00:09:27.992
Are you taking your medicine?

142
00:09:27.992 --> 00:09:31.862
Silly me. I keep forgetting. I didn't take it today.

143
00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:34.732
You need to take it every day.

144
00:09:34.732 --> 00:09:36.002
I will.

145
00:09:36.002 --> 00:09:38.002
She's quite cranky.

146
00:09:38.002 --> 00:09:40.401
The hospital ship is here.

147
00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:42.901
We don't come here every day.

148
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:45.242
Come on out to the ship,

149
00:09:45.242 --> 00:09:48.811
see the doctors, and get your medicine.

150
00:09:49.582 --> 00:09:50.982
Are you in?

151
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:54.752
- Sir. - We're from the hospital ship.

152
00:09:56.921 --> 00:09:59.651
- Is he not in? - Did he go out?

153
00:10:00.592 --> 00:10:02.592
I don't think anyone's home.

154
00:10:02.592 --> 00:10:05.161
He rarely leaves home since he had a stroke.

155
00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:11.332
Why'd you do that?

156
00:10:12.431 --> 00:10:14.972
- What was that noise? - That scared me.

157
00:10:15.742 --> 00:10:16.872
Where is he going?

158
00:10:20.342 --> 00:10:21.342
Sir.

159
00:10:21.442 --> 00:10:22.842
- Oh dear. - Oh no.

160
00:10:22.842 --> 00:10:24.781
- Oh dear. - This looks bad.

161
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:26.482
Get him up.

162
00:10:26.482 --> 00:10:27.582
Come on.

163
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:30.222
Get on his back.

164
00:10:32.992 --> 00:10:34.492
Doctor Song!

165
00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.692
Watch your step. Careful.

166
00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:39.962
Doctor Song. We need help.

167
00:10:39.962 --> 00:10:41.431
Get out here.

168
00:10:43.832 --> 00:10:45.472
Yes, it's him.

169
00:10:45.472 --> 00:10:46.901
Your butler.

170
00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:48.442
Let's get him inside.

171
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:50.342
What happened?

172
00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:53.342
His lower abdomen seems to hurt.

173
00:10:53.342 --> 00:10:54.612
Why didn't you call?

174
00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.712
I said I couldn't visit because Mom's sick.

175
00:10:56.712 --> 00:10:58.752
I told you to call if something happened.

176
00:10:58.752 --> 00:10:59.822
Hurry.

177
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:02.722
- Lay him with his head to that end. - Okay.

178
00:11:03.891 --> 00:11:05.122
There you go.

179
00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:06.462
Poor Mr. Chu.

180
00:11:06.462 --> 00:11:08.791
You're always carrying people on your bad back.

181
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:09.992
Temperature and blood test.

182
00:11:09.992 --> 00:11:11.031
Got it.

183
00:11:13.301 --> 00:11:14.462
Sounds bad, right?

184
00:11:14.832 --> 00:11:16.161
He has pulmonary emphysema.

185
00:11:16.161 --> 00:11:17.202
Temperature?

186
00:11:17.202 --> 00:11:18.671
Up to 38.5°C.

187
00:11:18.671 --> 00:11:19.702
(Pulmonary emphysema is a lung condition.)

188
00:11:20.442 --> 00:11:22.072
- I'll palpate his stomach. - Okay.

189
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:25.212
Sir, I'll lower the belt of your pants.

190
00:11:25.442 --> 00:11:26.942
- Help me. - Okay.

191
00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:30.452
Don't try to help. We'll do it.

192
00:11:30.612 --> 00:11:31.651
Let me see.

193
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:35.452
It's a hernia.

194
00:11:36.322 --> 00:11:37.791
I can't fix it manually.

195
00:11:38.352 --> 00:11:40.092
I'll need to check with an ultrasound,

196
00:11:40.092 --> 00:11:43.061
but based on his fever, I say it's an strangulated hernia.

197
00:11:43.061 --> 00:11:45.761
His twisted guts cut off the circulation and started to rot.

198
00:11:45.761 --> 00:11:48.301
Can you fix him with an operation?

199
00:11:48.702 --> 00:11:50.031
Let's check first.

200
00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:52.602
- Get the ultrasound. - Okay.

201
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:06.452
It is a strangulated hernia.

202
00:12:08.421 --> 00:12:10.092
The blood test results.

203
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:14.161
His pulse is quickening.

204
00:12:14.161 --> 00:12:15.592
We must operate now.

205
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:27.242
Why is the INR index...

206
00:12:27.242 --> 00:12:28.602
(INR index measures blood coagulation.)

207
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:35.082
- You can't operate? - No.

208
00:12:35.082 --> 00:12:36.911
- I said we can. - She said yes.

209
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:37.911
I stopped her.

210
00:12:37.911 --> 00:12:39.681
When the surgeon said yes?

211
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:42.551
It's not a transplant. It's just a hernia.

212
00:12:43.852 --> 00:12:46.151
She's good enough to throw a scalpel and fix him.

213
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:47.391
She has to open him up.

214
00:12:47.962 --> 00:12:50.761
No operation is easy, and this patient...

215
00:12:52.462 --> 00:12:53.502
can't be anesthetized.

216
00:12:54.031 --> 00:12:56.232
His pulmonary emphysema is too advanced.

217
00:12:56.431 --> 00:12:58.271
He won't survive a general anesthesia.

218
00:12:58.372 --> 00:12:59.801
Numb him from the waist down.

219
00:13:00.242 --> 00:13:02.342
Numb his spine like the ruptured sclera patient.

220
00:13:03.411 --> 00:13:04.411
No.

221
00:13:05.572 --> 00:13:06.982
You know why not, right?

222
00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:08.811
Because of warfarin?

223
00:13:09.141 --> 00:13:10.551
After his brain surgery...

224
00:13:10.551 --> 00:13:11.582
(Warfarin thins blood)

225
00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:13.122
He must have kept taking it.

226
00:13:14.482 --> 00:13:15.722
We can't stop the bleeding.

227
00:13:16.852 --> 00:13:19.122
If a blood clot forms in his spinal cord,

228
00:13:19.452 --> 00:13:21.891
it could pose a risk on his nerve system.

229
00:13:23.131 --> 00:13:25.531
There's septicemia and infections too.

230
00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:27.202
Even before surgery, the anesthesia...

231
00:13:27.202 --> 00:13:28.261
Could kill him.

232
00:13:33.972 --> 00:13:35.742
Why did you say it could be done?

233
00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:38.572
What can you do?

234
00:13:40.212 --> 00:13:42.411
- Use lidocaine locally. - What?

235
00:13:42.482 --> 00:13:43.781
I said it's improbable.

236
00:13:43.852 --> 00:13:46.411
If we don't do anything, he'll die of septicemia.

237
00:13:46.881 --> 00:13:49.482
It's still dangerous, even if we use a local anesthetic.

238
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:52.891
Do you think the patient can withstand the pain?

239
00:13:52.992 --> 00:13:56.092
He'll clench his stomach muscles. Can you even get through?

240
00:13:56.092 --> 00:13:57.992
I'll put him under with propofol and in an hour...

241
00:13:57.992 --> 00:14:00.131
- Doctor. - Reach the hernia,

242
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:01.702
and cut out the bare minimum.

243
00:14:01.901 --> 00:14:03.332
Stop daydreaming.

244
00:14:03.332 --> 00:14:05.702
A similar case was in Doctor Kwak's notes.

245
00:14:05.872 --> 00:14:07.372
I studied it enough, so...

246
00:14:07.372 --> 00:14:08.901
That was a war zone.

247
00:14:09.242 --> 00:14:10.911
They had nothing, so they had to...

248
00:14:10.911 --> 00:14:11.942
What's so different now?

249
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:14.482
Our tools and medicine are useless.

250
00:14:14.482 --> 00:14:17.051
Wait. Let me get this straight.

251
00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:20.881
The only problem is anesthesia, isn't it?

252
00:14:21.752 --> 00:14:23.452
Then I can help.

253
00:14:27.291 --> 00:14:28.492
How?

254
00:14:28.891 --> 00:14:31.391
This may be impossible to believe...

255
00:14:31.832 --> 00:14:33.161
or approve.

256
00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:37.232
Acupuncture anesthesia is my area of expertise.

257
00:14:37.572 --> 00:14:39.671
This was my concentration...

258
00:14:39.972 --> 00:14:41.671
through internship and residency.

259
00:14:41.671 --> 00:14:43.972
Jae Geol, I understand how you feel.

260
00:14:43.972 --> 00:14:45.041
Look at this.

261
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:47.811
It may be impossible to operate only with acupuncture anesthesia.

262
00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:50.582
Apply local anesthesia with lidocaine.

263
00:14:50.582 --> 00:14:53.281
Then apply acupuncture anesthesia with sedative.

264
00:14:53.281 --> 00:14:55.181
It won't be general anesthesia,

265
00:14:56.492 --> 00:14:58.592
- but it can have similar effects. - Jae Geol.

266
00:14:58.592 --> 00:15:00.592
I know it's hard to believe. However...

267
00:15:01.561 --> 00:15:04.291
Even if it has no effect at all,

268
00:15:05.832 --> 00:15:07.862
we could give it a try.

269
00:15:08.332 --> 00:15:10.088
It isn't anesthetic gas.

270
00:15:10.113 --> 00:15:11.431
It won't leave a mark on the spine.

271
00:15:11.431 --> 00:15:13.942
It won't harm the patient at all.

272
00:15:20.641 --> 00:15:22.411
You'll do it no matter what.

273
00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:24.582
You can't...

274
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:28.381
afford to lose that patient.

275
00:15:29.222 --> 00:15:31.352
I can't lose that patient either.

276
00:15:31.622 --> 00:15:33.092
To me,

277
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:37.592
he's more precious than my father.

278
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:44.131
Surgeon...

279
00:15:44.801 --> 00:15:47.541
Listen, Hyun. I...

280
00:15:50.671 --> 00:15:51.811
Shall we...

281
00:15:52.872 --> 00:15:54.281
give it a try?

282
00:15:58.952 --> 00:16:01.982
You're going to have the surgery even if it's with local anesthesia.

283
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:04.192
If the operation is necessary,

284
00:16:04.391 --> 00:16:06.222
I need one more safety measure.

285
00:16:06.222 --> 00:16:09.462
Can acupuncture anesthesia be a safety measure?

286
00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:13.102
We don't have much of a choice.

287
00:16:13.661 --> 00:16:17.002
We must reduce the amount of pain to minimize the risk.

288
00:16:17.002 --> 00:16:20.942
We must do everything that we can...

289
00:16:21.401 --> 00:16:23.811
to reduce the pain for the patient.

290
00:16:24.511 --> 00:16:25.811
That's my opinion.

291
00:16:26.242 --> 00:16:29.982
He says that it's harmless even in the worst-case scenario.

292
00:16:30.752 --> 00:16:31.911
Doctor.

293
00:16:36.622 --> 00:16:37.921
Okay.

294
00:16:39.492 --> 00:16:42.291
- Really? - Let's try it.

295
00:16:46.732 --> 00:16:48.561
Let go of me.

296
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:51.671
- Give me your arm. - Let me go.

297
00:16:52.171 --> 00:16:55.442
I'll die like this...

298
00:16:55.442 --> 00:16:58.242
with my eyes wide open.

299
00:16:58.242 --> 00:17:00.982
How could you open my stomach?

300
00:17:00.982 --> 00:17:03.011
Stop being stubborn, sir.

301
00:17:03.011 --> 00:17:04.781
You need surgery.

302
00:17:04.781 --> 00:17:06.252
Get away from me!

303
00:17:06.752 --> 00:17:10.791
Oh, my goodness.

304
00:17:12.551 --> 00:17:13.692
Gosh.

305
00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:16.392
Could you...

306
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:19.902
help me get up? Please?

307
00:17:20.732 --> 00:17:21.902
I'm leaving.

308
00:17:22.432 --> 00:17:25.702
I want to go somewhere...

309
00:17:25.702 --> 00:17:28.271
and die like this.

310
00:17:28.271 --> 00:17:29.672
That's all.

311
00:17:30.912 --> 00:17:33.942
Please let go of me.

312
00:17:33.942 --> 00:17:36.952
I said let me go.

313
00:17:52.162 --> 00:17:55.101
Jae Geol, let's go home.

314
00:17:55.732 --> 00:17:58.831
No, let go of me.

315
00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:01.242
I'm leaving.

316
00:18:01.972 --> 00:18:03.811
I'll go anywhere...

317
00:18:05.841 --> 00:18:07.742
and kill myself.

318
00:18:07.742 --> 00:18:11.011
Gosh, you shouldn't say...

319
00:18:11.011 --> 00:18:13.482
terrible things like that.

320
00:18:13.821 --> 00:18:17.222
I'll fix your bicycle.

321
00:18:17.952 --> 00:18:20.662
No, don't.

322
00:18:21.662 --> 00:18:24.232
I hate Mom and Dad.

323
00:18:24.261 --> 00:18:26.162
I'll kill myself.

324
00:18:26.162 --> 00:18:27.462
Jae Geol.

325
00:18:28.132 --> 00:18:29.561
You're only a child.

326
00:18:29.871 --> 00:18:32.371
Don't say terrible things like that.

327
00:18:32.831 --> 00:18:34.101
Do you understand?

328
00:18:44.811 --> 00:18:46.521
Are you being grumpy?

329
00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.021
I'm the one who's good at being grumpy.

330
00:18:51.192 --> 00:18:53.192
Why are you copying me?

331
00:18:56.561 --> 00:18:57.861
Are you afraid?

332
00:19:01.101 --> 00:19:02.801
I was.

333
00:19:03.801 --> 00:19:07.271
I thought my parents would abandon me...

334
00:19:09.442 --> 00:19:11.912
if I stayed in the shadow of my brother.

335
00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.382
I was afraid.

336
00:19:15.982 --> 00:19:17.652
That's why I was grumpy.

337
00:19:21.051 --> 00:19:22.551
Every time I was grumpy,

338
00:19:23.351 --> 00:19:26.492
you held my hand tightly like this.

339
00:19:26.962 --> 00:19:28.422
You comforted me.

340
00:19:30.892 --> 00:19:35.132
You've done a lot for me with this hand.

341
00:19:37.402 --> 00:19:39.902
You taught me how to ride a bike.

342
00:19:40.841 --> 00:19:43.111
You put training wheels on my bike.

343
00:19:45.172 --> 00:19:47.581
Pops, you did everything...

344
00:19:49.382 --> 00:19:51.212
that a father would...

345
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:56.081
normally do for his child.

346
00:20:01.105 --> 00:20:04.337

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

347
00:20:12.672 --> 00:20:14.242
Jae Geol.

348
00:20:14.942 --> 00:20:16.402
When will you...

349
00:20:16.912 --> 00:20:20.081
stop calling me Pops?

350
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:25.452
When you were young,

351
00:20:26.152 --> 00:20:30.452
I let you call me Pops since you held a lot of grudges.

352
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.392
However,

353
00:20:32.952 --> 00:20:35.561
when I get better after the surgery,

354
00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:37.291
I'll...

355
00:20:38.591 --> 00:20:42.632
make sure that you keep your manners.

356
00:20:43.331 --> 00:20:44.632
Can we...

357
00:20:46.331 --> 00:20:47.642
proceed with the surgery?

358
00:21:03.422 --> 00:21:05.152
You're a man.

359
00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:08.861
Why are you crying?

360
00:21:15.761 --> 00:21:18.672
Gosh, it's big.

361
00:21:21.942 --> 00:21:24.712
When did Jae Geol's hands...

362
00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:27.942
get so big?

363
00:22:39.412 --> 00:22:40.952
Lidocaine, please.

364
00:22:56.702 --> 00:22:58.071
Give me one more.

365
00:23:10.152 --> 00:23:12.482
I feel extremely anxious.

366
00:23:12.482 --> 00:23:15.722
Stop moving about. You're making me dizzy.

367
00:23:15.722 --> 00:23:18.452
You have no sympathy, do you?

368
00:23:21.261 --> 00:23:23.192
What are you doing over there?

369
00:23:28.261 --> 00:23:29.561
Are you crying?

370
00:23:29.561 --> 00:23:32.232
What are you talking about?

371
00:23:32.232 --> 00:23:34.071
Is it because you're worried?

372
00:23:34.071 --> 00:23:36.571
No, I'm not.

373
00:23:36.841 --> 00:23:40.511
The doctors from different departments work as a team...

374
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:43.351
and try their best to save a patient.

375
00:23:43.351 --> 00:23:46.551
To see them that way makes me emotional.

376
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:49.682
Of course. I totally understand.

377
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:56.091
Retractor.

378
00:24:01.902 --> 00:24:03.002
Net.

379
00:24:03.601 --> 00:24:04.771
Forceps.

380
00:24:11.642 --> 00:24:13.942
Pull the retractor a little more so that I can see better.

381
00:24:20.952 --> 00:24:22.252
It's okay.

382
00:24:23.192 --> 00:24:24.992
It's just a feeling.

383
00:24:38.732 --> 00:24:41.942
Would the acupuncture really help them anesthetize the patient?

384
00:24:41.942 --> 00:24:44.871
I'm not sure. I work in Korean Medicine,

385
00:24:44.871 --> 00:24:47.212
but I can't really believe it either.

386
00:24:49.511 --> 00:24:51.752
Doctor. Doctor Cha.

387
00:24:51.882 --> 00:24:53.321
Can you believe it?

388
00:24:53.521 --> 00:24:55.621
I'm just praying...

389
00:24:55.722 --> 00:24:57.452
for a miracle.

390
00:25:01.662 --> 00:25:02.761
Doctor!

391
00:25:04.162 --> 00:25:06.162
His blood oxygen level is...

392
00:25:09.031 --> 00:25:12.402
Why is it so low? Are you sure the patient is stable?

393
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:15.601
Gosh, it startled me.

394
00:25:15.902 --> 00:25:18.942
I'm sorry. It must have fallen while we moved him.

395
00:25:27.452 --> 00:25:28.752
Let's continue.

396
00:25:29.992 --> 00:25:32.291
How much time do we have left?

397
00:25:32.291 --> 00:25:34.162
13 minutes.

398
00:25:44.132 --> 00:25:45.571
It drove me crazy.

399
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:48.841
Doctors.

400
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:51.472
How... How did it go?

401
00:25:53.011 --> 00:25:55.311
The surgery went well, right?

402
00:25:55.841 --> 00:25:58.752
- Of course. - Yes! It worked.

403
00:25:59.182 --> 00:26:02.051
- How? - What do you mean, how?

404
00:26:02.382 --> 00:26:04.521
Did the acupuncture really anesthetize him?

405
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:06.821
Come on, it couldn't have.

406
00:26:06.821 --> 00:26:09.321
I like to get acupunctures myself,

407
00:26:09.462 --> 00:26:11.061
but that's impossible.

408
00:26:11.432 --> 00:26:13.632
Mr. Park did a great job enduring it rather than you, Jae Geol.

409
00:26:13.632 --> 00:26:15.902
Maybe he desperately endured the pain to make you look good.

410
00:26:15.902 --> 00:26:17.202
Not a chance.

411
00:26:17.432 --> 00:26:20.041
How can someone endure the pain of an open surgery?

412
00:26:20.871 --> 00:26:23.611
Don't you think so, Doctor Song?

413
00:26:25.912 --> 00:26:27.111
Of course.

414
00:26:27.712 --> 00:26:31.081
It's not the kind of pain you can endure with willpower.

415
00:26:33.682 --> 00:26:37.021
Did she just take the side of a doctor of Korean Medicine too?

416
00:26:37.021 --> 00:26:39.992
Did you hear that? You should've stayed quiet at least.

417
00:26:40.021 --> 00:26:42.692
Jae Geol, come on. Don't be upset.

418
00:26:42.692 --> 00:26:43.892
Don't follow me.

419
00:27:25.232 --> 00:27:26.402
Here.

420
00:27:27.502 --> 00:27:28.902
Come on, take it.

421
00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:34.382
I will make sure...

422
00:27:35.242 --> 00:27:37.511
to pay you back for this someday.

423
00:27:40.152 --> 00:27:42.781
Great work. Cheers.

424
00:27:55.301 --> 00:27:58.232
Now, it's your turn.

425
00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:04.212
"Great work, Doctor Kim."

426
00:28:04.611 --> 00:28:07.581
"I was able to save the patient, thanks to you."

427
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.900
(Episode 18 will air shortly.)
