4
00:00:15.038 --> 00:00:18.025
Aren't you going to eat, Hyun Soo?

5
00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:21.729
You're the only person who read
the script for episode 9.

6
00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:24.772
I saw the location
where they're shooting today

7
00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:27.926
and it is not where you set episode 8.

8
00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:32.522
It's because it's always somewhere else
that it doesn't seem realistic.

9
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.385
They're all so busy
with the shoot

10
00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.137
that's probably why they didn't have
time to read the next episode.

11
00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:41.092
Let's eat something delicious
and get our spirits up.

12
00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:44.070
I made the reservation.

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.732
You pay, Soo Hyun.

14
00:00:45.732 --> 00:00:47.760
It's kind of an expensive place.

15
00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:54.287
You always know how to
make me feel better.

16
00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:04.200
Hello.

17
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.337
Yes, hello.

18
00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:06.849
Allow me to escort you to your seat.

19
00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.581
Have you been here before, Hyun Soo?

20
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:13.471
How did you think of
making a reservation here?

21
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:15.824
Because it seemed to me
that you wanted to come here.

22
00:01:15.824 --> 00:01:18.455
You asked me about
Chef Ohn Jung Seon last time.

23
00:01:20.468 --> 00:01:24.497
I love you to the stars
and back, Kyung.

24
00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:25.655
Really?

25
00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:31.486
Is the sea bream okay today, Ha Sung?

26
00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:32.486
Yes, Chef!

27
00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:33.956
Make sure you get the temperature right.

28
00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:34.958
Yes, Chef.

29
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.229
Table four, two lunch courses.

30
00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.533
We'll be serving them their
amuse-bouche soon

31
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.899
so put the fish in early!

32
00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.075
- Yes, Sir!
- Yes, Sir!

33
00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:45.494
Excuse me, Chef.

34
00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:49.078
The order that just came in is
for Writer Lee Hyun Soo's table.

35
00:01:58.215 --> 00:01:59.771
Isn't it really delicious?

36
00:02:00.477 --> 00:02:02.801
It's a good thing I brought you here.

37
00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:05.667
You look so happy while you're eating.

38
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:09.741
I'm just living in the moment.

39
00:02:10.378 --> 00:02:13.184
Because I don't know when I'll be
happy again when this moment passes.

40
00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:16.421
Hearing that makes me too sad.

41
00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:18.981
It sounds as if misfortune will
strike again almost immediately.

42
00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:23.278
Did you enjoy your meal?

43
00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.398
Oh.

44
00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:32.469
How did you know I was here?

45
00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:35.820
Oh... you're close with him, aren't you?

46
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.344
Seeing as how you're using informal
speech with each other.

47
00:02:38.344 --> 00:02:41.551
Yeah. This is mu junior,
whom I love.

48
00:02:45.354 --> 00:02:47.113
Oh, Hyun Soo!

49
00:02:48.274 --> 00:02:49.504
Why are you getting up?

50
00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:50.974
I'm going to go.

51
00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:53.320
You won't need to work
on your script, so just go home.

52
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.452
Your place is close by.

53
00:02:54.452 --> 00:02:56.391
I'll go to the studio
and monitor the situation

54
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:57.917
and I'll call you if anything changes.

55
00:02:57.917 --> 00:02:59.065
Goodbye.

56
00:03:02.267 --> 00:03:04.733
Why... is she being like that?

57
00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:07.940
I think she's telling you to
stay here longer.

58
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:12.574
You've never been to my place, right?

59
00:03:33.687 --> 00:03:35.941
You can't sit still because
you're so curious, huh?

60
00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:37.191
How'd you know?

61
00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:42.846
Wow, this smells great.

62
00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:44.578
It's Blue Mountain coffee.

63
00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:47.205
Not even you can afford it,
since it's too expensive.

64
00:03:47.205 --> 00:03:49.088
I received this as a gift.

65
00:03:51.188 --> 00:03:53.899
All right, my ears are open now.

66
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.894
If you're wondering whether you should
tell me or not, just tell me.

67
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:05.900
I heard from Hong Ah...

68
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.168
about you and her.

69
00:04:09.043 --> 00:04:12.487
Tell me exactly what you heard, so
there's no room for misunderstanding.

70
00:04:12.487 --> 00:04:15.428
How are you so resolute
and stoic all the time?

71
00:04:16.545 --> 00:04:18.520
I've rarely seen you
lose your cool.

72
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.103
You're so sure of your goals and
you don't care about what others think.

73
00:04:22.103 --> 00:04:24.032
I really envy you.

74
00:04:30.222 --> 00:04:33.619
I have nobody to catch me
if I stumble and fall.

75
00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.956
I don't have the luxury to stumble.

76
00:04:37.848 --> 00:04:40.432
So there's no need for you
to be envious of me.

77
00:04:41.603 --> 00:04:43.949
I feel like Hong Ah and I
are fighting over a guy

78
00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.477
and it makes me uncomfortable.

79
00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:49.287
Give up on me, then.

80
00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.787
If you like me so little that you can
give up on me, then just give up now.

81
00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:00.737
I loathe causing any emotional
distress in anyone.

82
00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:04.328
I never once caused you
emotional distress while we dated.

83
00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:09.711
So, Ms. Lee Hyun Soo, who says,
"humans are insignificant."

84
00:05:10.728 --> 00:05:14.588
Ms. Lee Hyun Soo, who pushes away the
man who loves her, because of reality.

85
00:05:16.944 --> 00:05:19.867
What reason can you give
me for us to start over?

86
00:05:22.847 --> 00:05:24.496
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:30.261
I'm scared.

88
00:05:31.307 --> 00:05:33.859
There's no reason that a woman who
dumped me once

89
00:05:33.859 --> 00:05:36.615
couldn't dump me again.

90
00:05:40.538 --> 00:05:42.658
Reality is always harsh.

91
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.865
I thought about only you.

92
00:06:03.795 --> 00:06:07.775
Love is something that two people share,
but I thought only about myself.

93
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.105
I treated it too lightly.

94
00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.386
I'll think about it.

95
00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:46.817
Congratulations.

96
00:06:46.817 --> 00:06:50.025
I said I'd come to you,
so why did you come here?

97
00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:52.514
I don't have a single moment
to waste by sitting down.

98
00:06:52.514 --> 00:06:54.357
I want to hurry up and leave.

99
00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:59.439
I want to hurry up and see my
dreams become reality.

100
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:05.355
Well, if you've been chosen as
a winner for HNC's open call

101
00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:08.419
you'll be contracted to work with
HNC for five years.

102
00:07:08.997 --> 00:07:12.540
It'll be difficult for us to collaborate
with you on this project.

103
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.905
Why do you think I chose your production
company among the many out there?

104
00:07:17.823 --> 00:07:21.222
All right, let's give this
some consideration.

105
00:07:22.078 --> 00:07:25.134
Have you read my script yet?

106
00:07:25.134 --> 00:07:28.431
It was a nice, easy read,
which was nice.

107
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:33.465
Things like birth secrets and conflicts
between the rich and poor never get old.

108
00:07:34.965 --> 00:07:36.186
That's what I was going for.

109
00:07:36.186 --> 00:07:39.662
Most of the characters in there are
based on the people I know.

110
00:07:39.662 --> 00:07:42.220
It'll be more realistic
than other TV shows.

111
00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:45.879
Let's think about whether we should
sign a contract or not.

112
00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:47.617
If we do sign a contract,
what I want

113
00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:50.153
is for you to pay me more than Hyun Soo,
even by just 10 won.

114
00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:52.961
That will be difficult.

115
00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:54.828
It's because of your
personal feelings, right?

116
00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:57.686
- It's because you like her...
- Ms. Ji Hong Ah.

117
00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:02.228
Writer Ji Hong Ah.

118
00:08:02.228 --> 00:08:06.008
There are some rules you need to follow
if you want to work with me.

119
00:08:06.948 --> 00:08:09.686
First, you must mind your manners.

120
00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:14.413
Writer Lee started as a
winner for an open call

121
00:08:14.413 --> 00:08:17.420
and then got great reviews on the
show she wrote after that.

122
00:08:18.674 --> 00:08:22.035
You're nowhere near that level yet.

123
00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:24.681
Hyun Soo wrote a one-act.

124
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:26.631
But I won with an episodic script.

125
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.287
Writing a TV show isn't about the words.

126
00:08:28.287 --> 00:08:30.655
They're judged by whether or not
they make it on the air.

127
00:08:54.884 --> 00:08:56.711
Yes, CEO Park?

128
00:08:56.711 --> 00:08:58.533
What are you up to?

129
00:08:59.486 --> 00:09:02.658
Um... thinking.

130
00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:04.063
Thinking?
As if.

131
00:09:04.063 --> 00:09:07.980
Come out. Thinking too much at a time
like this will only make your head hurt.

132
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.081
It's better to take a walk.

133
00:09:24.754 --> 00:09:26.318
It's not here.

134
00:09:26.865 --> 00:09:29.721
It headed back inside after
doing what it needed to do.

135
00:09:29.722 --> 00:09:31.461
It's not dead?

136
00:09:33.127 --> 00:09:35.600
Flowers bloom according
to the season, you know.

137
00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:41.072
Its season passed, so it'll
rest and come back out again.

138
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.514
I didn't know you had a side
like this, CEO Park.

139
00:09:51.514 --> 00:09:52.634
What kind of side?

140
00:09:53.206 --> 00:09:56.413
Being warm?
Being shy?

141
00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:59.755
Why did you start thinking that?

142
00:10:00.922 --> 00:10:04.459
Someone threw a bomb at me again.

143
00:10:04.928 --> 00:10:07.412
You wanted me to be prepared
before I was hit

144
00:10:07.412 --> 00:10:09.890
and you wanted to
show me how to be strong

145
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:14.211
and make sure I knew that life goes on,
or something like that, right?

146
00:10:15.653 --> 00:10:17.394
Something like that.

147
00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:25.036
Ms. Hong Ah came to see me
not too long ago, with her work.

148
00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:26.923
And I met with her today, too.

149
00:10:27.533 --> 00:10:28.774
What did she say?

150
00:10:28.774 --> 00:10:30.350
She wanted to sign a contract with me.

151
00:10:30.884 --> 00:10:32.817
Are you going to do it?

152
00:10:32.817 --> 00:10:34.749
I'm on the fence about it.

153
00:10:36.055 --> 00:10:39.005
Half of me really likes the
script because it's good.

154
00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:41.495
But another half of me feels like
her personality is too much.

155
00:10:43.461 --> 00:10:45.658
What does her personality matter?

156
00:10:45.658 --> 00:10:47.326
It's not like you'll be living with her.

157
00:10:48.943 --> 00:10:50.721
Why, are you going to live with her?

158
00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:53.044
No.

159
00:10:53.044 --> 00:10:55.461
Then just do as you always do.

160
00:10:59.637 --> 00:11:03.095
Wow, the sky is so beautiful.

161
00:11:04.182 --> 00:11:07.534
It's been a while since I've gotten
such a nice look at the sky.

162
00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:10.279
The sky really is pretty.

163
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.236
I have something I want to ask you.

164
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.028
Is it okay if I ask?

165
00:11:20.028 --> 00:11:23.028
You've never asked me if you
could ask something before you did.

166
00:11:24.029 --> 00:11:26.927
I change my mind a lot...

167
00:11:27.985 --> 00:11:30.076
and don't take things
very seriously, right?

168
00:11:32.318 --> 00:11:34.395
Who said that?

169
00:11:34.395 --> 00:11:35.993
Just someone.

170
00:11:35.993 --> 00:11:38.038
Someone said that.

171
00:11:38.586 --> 00:11:41.893
You're saying all sorts of crazy things
just because things aren't working out.

172
00:11:43.499 --> 00:11:46.081
That person has the
wrong idea about you.

173
00:11:47.485 --> 00:11:50.105
The problem with you is that
you think too much.

174
00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:52.047
Especially about love.

175
00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:54.481
You can just go where
your heart takes you.

176
00:11:55.999 --> 00:11:59.393
How much longer are you going to be alone
clinging to unsubstantial emotions?

177
00:11:59.393 --> 00:12:00.576
Stop that already.

178
00:12:01.783 --> 00:12:04.416
Stop keeping that man in your heart
if you can't have him.

179
00:12:06.201 --> 00:12:10.432
You're realistic, and yet you're not
when it comes to love.

180
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.326
Right now, your reality is me.

181
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.062
This view is always so amazing,
no matter when I see it.

182
00:12:25.062 --> 00:12:28.206
I hope that we can recoup our
losses for just this month.

183
00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.735
"A Star's Life Menu" needs to be a hit.

184
00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:34.139
We'll appeal to the masses with your
face first, before your food.

185
00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:35.908
What's so great about my face?

186
00:12:35.908 --> 00:12:38.539
You're handsome.
And you're miserly.

187
00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:40.507
That is charming to the ladies, too.

188
00:12:40.507 --> 00:12:42.394
What do you mean,
I'm miserly?

189
00:12:42.904 --> 00:12:45.725
You're stingy when it comes to
showing affection to women.

190
00:12:49.134 --> 00:12:52.293
It's because I've been burned
too many times.

191
00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:55.182
By people who have really severe
emotional ups and downs.

192
00:12:55.182 --> 00:12:56.731
It's difficult.

193
00:12:58.807 --> 00:13:01.620
But still, weren't you too
mean to Hong Ah?

194
00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:05.182
I mean, she's a girl, and she really...

195
00:13:05.182 --> 00:13:06.768
and she's no ordinary girl.

196
00:13:06.768 --> 00:13:08.496
And she's prettier than
the average pretty girl.

197
00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:11.196
So if a girl like that comes at you, you
should at least glance her way once.

198
00:13:11.196 --> 00:13:13.413
Why would I, when
I can't take responsibility?

199
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.050
You really are strange.

200
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.988
How could you say such things to me,
when you like Hong Ah?

201
00:13:19.807 --> 00:13:22.250
I don't like her.
I love her.

202
00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:28.187
I'm waiting for her.

203
00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:35.000
To be honest, a part of me was hoping
that you'd be really cruel to her.

204
00:13:35.596 --> 00:13:38.197
But when I see her now,
I feel bad for her.

205
00:13:40.475 --> 00:13:43.364
I'm reminded of my mom
all of the sudden.

206
00:13:43.846 --> 00:13:46.586
I think men and women are
such interesting creatures.

207
00:13:47.121 --> 00:13:50.057
If Hong Ah were a man, I would've ended
things already by beating her up.

208
00:13:54.991 --> 00:13:57.413
I really hope that things
work out for both of us.

209
00:13:57.413 --> 00:13:59.173
I hope "A Star's Life Menu"
becomes popular!

210
00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:01.502
Become successful!
Become successful!

211
00:14:01.502 --> 00:14:03.048
Have you made your decision?

212
00:14:03.048 --> 00:14:04.572
I want to apologize.

213
00:14:04.572 --> 00:14:06.884
You... want to apologize?

214
00:14:06.884 --> 00:14:10.086
- To Chef Ohn Jung Seon.
- I see.

215
00:14:10.086 --> 00:14:11.989
- To be honest, at first...
- Yes?

216
00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:15.267
I thought you only got on the show
because you're a pretty face, like me.

217
00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:17.601
You're just bursting with charisma
until the very end!

218
00:14:19.788 --> 00:14:20.918

The most searched name is Ohn Jung Seon,
and the second is Chef Ohn!

223
00:14:28.336 --> 00:14:29.403
Wow!

224
00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:31.139
The number one search result
right now is Ohn Jung Seon!

225
00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:33.464
"Is his face real?"

"Where's his restaurant?
I want to go visit!"

"Wow, the muscles moving around on

Let's make Chef Ohn
the most searched term!

230
00:14:44.692 --> 00:14:46.435
They said they want to come
to our restaurant!

231
00:14:46.435 --> 00:14:47.711
I really want them to come!

232
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:50.755
This is amazing.
Chef Ohn, you're a star!

False hopes are forbidden!

234
00:14:52.447 --> 00:14:55.230
Even so, tomorrow may be
different than yesterday!

235
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.230
Let's go! Yeah!

236
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.980

239
00:15:17.787 --> 00:15:19.596
- Get out.
- Here?

240
00:15:19.596 --> 00:15:22.224
Are you planning to die with me, then?

241
00:15:46.398 --> 00:15:49.356
Ugh, how boring.

242
00:15:49.356 --> 00:15:52.287
I'm sure the ratings will have
dropped like crazy by tomorrow.

243
00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:56.395
Why do they keep having
explosions, fires, and fights?

244
00:15:57.393 --> 00:15:59.666
They threw out pretty much
all of what I wrote.

245
00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:05.769
They had writers who were
working on this beforehand, Hyun Soo.

246
00:16:07.904 --> 00:16:09.471
You'll get through this.

247
00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:12.625
You're still the one being credited with
the writing. Who'll know?

248
00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:13.941
I will.

249
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:15.998
It might as well be everyone.

250
00:16:16.844 --> 00:16:18.584
Where are you going?

251
00:16:18.584 --> 00:16:20.259
I need to go see for myself.

252
00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:22.486
I can't just make judgment calls
based off assumptions.

253
00:16:27.645 --> 00:16:29.046
Oh, Writer Lee.

254
00:16:29.046 --> 00:16:31.890
We edited tomorrow's episode.
I didn't even have the chance to go home

255
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.121
because we finished the shoot so late.

256
00:16:33.121 --> 00:16:34.371
I saw the episode.

257
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.975
Yi Bok was working on this with other
writers, not just Writer Park.

258
00:16:39.975 --> 00:16:43.322
It would've been nice if someone
had told me about that beforehand.

259
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.452
Just think about this realistically.

260
00:16:46.452 --> 00:16:47.880
Just deal with it!

261
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.041
The writing is being
credited to you, anyway.

262
00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:51.760
You'll be a writer who has
a mini-series that was on the air!

263
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.854
It'll be easier for you
next time around.

264
00:17:03.265 --> 00:17:05.997
<i>Even up until the point that
I quit working at the company...</i>

265
00:17:05.997 --> 00:17:08.861
<i>I thought that I'd become
a writer immediately.</i>

266
00:17:10.525 --> 00:17:12.567
I like Yeouido.

267
00:17:13.612 --> 00:17:15.849
I told myself that I'd dance
in Yeouido Park

268
00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:19.033
if I was chosen as a winner
of the open call.

269
00:17:21.144 --> 00:17:22.520
Get lots of rest.

270
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.099
You're dishonest.

271
00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:26.546
You pretend that you're kind, care
for others, and that you work hard.

272
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:29.215
But I've never met someone as
wicked as you in my 10 years as a writer.

273
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.827
You want to become a writer, huh?

274
00:17:30.827 --> 00:17:32.897
Yeah, you'll probably make it.

275
00:17:33.812 --> 00:17:37.842
<i>Usually, the nasty bitches like you
are the ones that make it in this field!</i>

276
00:17:37.842 --> 00:17:40.946
And Writer Lee is no ordinary person.

277
00:17:40.946 --> 00:17:42.955
You know too, since
you've seen it for yourself!

278
00:17:42.955 --> 00:17:46.067
She looks so gentle and smiles a lot,
so I thought she was a kind person.

279
00:17:47.842 --> 00:17:51.197
<i>- They got new writers.
- They've been using other writers.</i>

280
00:17:51.197 --> 00:17:55.310
<i>Ms. Lee Hyun Soo, who always changes her
mind, saying humans are insignificant.</i>

281
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.248
<i>Ms. Lee Hyun Soo, who pushes away the
man who loves her because of reality.</i>

282
00:18:07.437 --> 00:18:09.792
CEO Park.

283
00:18:09.792 --> 00:18:12.650
The episode that aired today wasn't
based on Hyun Soo's script.

284
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.423
The ratings are higher than
they were last week.

285
00:18:15.423 --> 00:18:17.754
Things will probably get
difficult for Writer Lee.

286
00:18:21.272 --> 00:18:22.913
Do you think she'll be fired?

287
00:18:22.913 --> 00:18:24.702
No.

288
00:18:24.702 --> 00:18:26.795
It's Writer Lee's story,
so how could they fire her?

289
00:18:26.795 --> 00:18:29.796
They'll leave her name on there, but
the ghostwriter will keep writing.

290
00:18:29.796 --> 00:18:31.622
That's a relief!

291
00:18:31.622 --> 00:18:34.746
I was so scared that she'd be fired
since so many crazy things are happening.

292
00:18:35.852 --> 00:18:40.196
I came to ask you to stop that from
happening, just in case.

293
00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:42.651
Geez!

294
00:18:42.651 --> 00:18:45.716
Geez!
Ugh, I'm so tired!

295
00:18:45.716 --> 00:18:46.975
Ugh, I'm so worn out!

296
00:18:46.975 --> 00:18:50.026
Hey, hey, move it!
Ugh.

297
00:18:50.026 --> 00:18:52.265
I hate all of the people
from the broadcasting company!

298
00:18:52.265 --> 00:18:53.622
Why are you being like that?

299
00:18:54.775 --> 00:18:57.176
I'll get going now, CEO Park.

300
00:18:57.244 --> 00:18:59.072
Did you not hear me,
Ms. Kyung?

301
00:18:59.072 --> 00:19:00.696
Excuse me!
Ms. Kyung!

302
00:19:00.696 --> 00:19:02.053
Hey!

303
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.081
Who's writing the script now?

304
00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:06.039
There's a team of three
people writing it.

305
00:19:07.123 --> 00:19:09.385
They won't be able to fire Hyun Soo
if she doesn't quit herself.

306
00:19:09.385 --> 00:19:10.697
So tell her to just hang in there.

307
00:19:10.697 --> 00:19:14.100
And that this contempt will
surely bring her glory later.

308
00:19:14.706 --> 00:19:19.013
What good will it do her to get glory
if she's broken inside?

309
00:19:20.949 --> 00:19:22.413
Are you going to stay here?

310
00:19:22.413 --> 00:19:23.830
Are you going somewhere?

311
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.933
There's someone I need to meet up with.

312
00:19:45.834 --> 00:19:48.221
Congrats. People loved you.

313
00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:49.594
Ugh.

314
00:19:49.594 --> 00:19:51.552
I'm sure you're still giddy about it.

315
00:19:51.552 --> 00:19:53.228
Chef Ohn Jung Seon.

316
00:19:54.623 --> 00:19:57.571
I don't know if I deserve to be
congratulated for this.

317
00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:58.840
It is something to be
congratulated for.

318
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.706
They're all enamored by you,
even though they don't even know you.

319
00:20:00.706 --> 00:20:02.957
- You think so?
- Yeah.

320
00:20:02.957 --> 00:20:04.965
You're now loved by everyone
without even trying.

321
00:20:05.898 --> 00:20:07.775
It's all thanks to you.

322
00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:09.428
It's definitely worth celebrating.

323
00:20:09.428 --> 00:20:10.835
And it had nothing to do with luck.

324
00:20:18.596 --> 00:20:20.885
Did you come here this late at night
to congratulate me?

325
00:20:20.885 --> 00:20:22.515
Well, that, too.

326
00:20:22.515 --> 00:20:24.448
But I had a favor to ask of you.

327
00:20:24.448 --> 00:20:25.661
What is it?

328
00:20:25.661 --> 00:20:27.875
I want to propose to someone.

329
00:20:27.875 --> 00:20:31.042
When?
And, to whom?

330
00:20:31.042 --> 00:20:34.760
I usually make the really
important decisions by myself.

331
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.056
Wow, this woman who is really
important to you must be happy.

332
00:20:39.413 --> 00:20:41.142
Do you really think so?

333
00:20:41.142 --> 00:20:43.448
Yeah. You really are a
man among men.

334
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:46.938
I want to do it at Good Soup.

335
00:20:46.938 --> 00:20:50.343
Go ahead. I'll make it
super fancy for you.

336
00:20:50.343 --> 00:20:51.667
Thanks.

337
00:21:01.654 --> 00:21:03.392
- You're curious, right?
- Yeah.

338
00:21:09.016 --> 00:21:10.041
Were you sleeping?

339
00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:11.347
Yeah.
What's going on?

340
00:21:11.347 --> 00:21:12.690
Why are all of you here?

341
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.985
Bo Ra!

342
00:21:14.985 --> 00:21:16.972
I heard there was an article
about you, Aunt!

343
00:21:16.972 --> 00:21:18.027
Bo Ra!

344
00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.777
Stop it, Mom.
You'll scare her.

345
00:21:20.675 --> 00:21:22.820
Oh, you're so good at talking, Bo Ra!

346
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.556
She talks at a level that is way above
an average four-year-old's.

347
00:21:25.556 --> 00:21:26.652
Right?

348
00:21:27.457 --> 00:21:28.632
Yeah.

349
00:21:28.632 --> 00:21:29.902
She takes after her aunt.

350
00:21:29.902 --> 00:21:31.350
Hyun Soo was just like that.

351
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:35.015
Yeah, Hyun Soo has been really clever
ever since she was young.

352
00:21:35.015 --> 00:21:38.190
If I heard you all say this before I got
married, I would've thrown a fit.

353
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.103
I really like my brother-in-law
and have a lot of love for him

354
00:21:41.103 --> 00:21:44.524
but the one thing I always want to ask
is, why would he marry Hyun Yi?

355
00:21:44.524 --> 00:21:46.652
- Big Sis.
- Just look.

356
00:21:46.652 --> 00:21:48.722
Back then, she would've
kicked me for that.

357
00:21:50.085 --> 00:21:51.745
What was the article about?

358
00:21:53.937 --> 00:21:57.818
I heard that you wrote the show
with someone else.

359
00:21:57.818 --> 00:21:58.962
Yeah.

360
00:21:58.962 --> 00:22:00.856
Hyun Yi is really good
at this kind of thing.

361
00:22:00.856 --> 00:22:03.054
Saying the things that are
difficult to say.

362
00:22:07.315 --> 00:22:08.781
You didn't know?

363
00:22:08.781 --> 00:22:10.825
No, I did, but it still hurts.

364
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.652
It still hurts.

365
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:18.536
But you got a show you wrote on the air!
You're doing so much better than before.

366
00:22:19.695 --> 00:22:21.916
Let's eat this, Mom.

367
00:22:21.916 --> 00:22:24.087
We have to feed her.
If we do, she'll feel better.

368
00:22:24.087 --> 00:22:25.590
Right, Bo Ra?

369
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.255
Oh, you're such a cutie.

370
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.187
Yes. I understand.

371
00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:38.966
One reservation for two guests on Sunday,
October 14th, at 7 p.m. has been made.

372
00:22:38.966 --> 00:22:40.996
- Make some fillets!
- All right!

373
00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:00.574
Yes, this is Good Soup.

374
00:23:00.574 --> 00:23:02.930
- All done!
- Cool it down!

375
00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:06.459
We're short on fillets.
We need to make more.

376
00:23:06.459 --> 00:23:07.570
We're packed for lunch, too.

377
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.705
Yes, Chef.

378
00:23:08.705 --> 00:23:11.460
- Two steaks for table 10.
- Yes, Chef.

379
00:23:15.363 --> 00:23:16.541
Wow.

380
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:17.798
My blood sugar is so low that
I taste sweetness in my mouth.

381
00:23:17.798 --> 00:23:18.832
- Mm.
- Wow.

382
00:23:18.832 --> 00:23:20.261
You guys are so energetic.

383
00:23:20.261 --> 00:23:22.687
I guess the differences between us
are getting clearer now.

384
00:23:23.444 --> 00:23:24.635
You guessed it yourself, Sous Chef!

385
00:23:24.635 --> 00:23:26.170
Stop that, already.

386
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.735
You always have to confirm
people's beliefs.

387
00:23:27.735 --> 00:23:29.232
Hey, you're even worse!

388
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.379
You said all of our dinner reservations
are booked, right?

389
00:23:33.379 --> 00:23:35.963
Yes. We're almost fully booked
for this entire week, too.

390
00:23:35.963 --> 00:23:40.340
- Wow!
- Wow!

391
00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.516
Chef.

392
00:23:41.516 --> 00:23:44.089
We can't just let
this historical day pass us by!

393
00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.365
Nope!

394
00:23:45.365 --> 00:23:46.972
Let's sweat it out later
and celebrate.

395
00:23:46.972 --> 00:23:48.000
Sound good?

396
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.116
- Sounds great!
- Sounds great!

00:24:17.462 --> 00:24:19.977
- Should I endure it?
- Endure it!

403
00:24:21.192 --> 00:24:22.968
- You need to say it, too.
- Hm?

Um, yeah.

I'll quit.

407
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.527
I'll withdraw from the production
of "Foul Detective."

408
00:24:58.709 --> 00:25:01.283
Why are you being like this,
Writer Lee?

409
00:25:01.283 --> 00:25:04.767
I told you to think realistically! You
only need to endure it for a short while!

410
00:25:04.767 --> 00:25:06.116
I can't.

411
00:25:06.116 --> 00:25:08.617
I have no idea why I should endure.

412
00:25:09.631 --> 00:25:11.150
I'm sorry.

413
00:25:12.189 --> 00:25:14.716
You were so kind to me, Chief Producer.

414
00:25:16.773 --> 00:25:18.325
But I give up.

415
00:25:18.325 --> 00:25:20.978
You'll regret it!

416
00:25:20.978 --> 00:25:24.722
If you want to survive in this industry
and be a part of it, listen to me!

417
00:25:25.373 --> 00:25:27.021

Looks like you caused trouble again,
Writer Lee Hyun Soo.

432
00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:56.300
I got a call from
Chief Producer Yoo Hong Jin.

433
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.263
Are you really going to be like this?

434
00:26:58.729 --> 00:27:00.093
Come to the office!

435
00:27:12.454 --> 00:27:15.033

want to say, then say it.

Hurry up and scold me.
I want to leave.

437
00:27:25.334 --> 00:27:29.058
Why do you think that
I'm going to scold you?

438
00:27:30.795 --> 00:27:33.001
Because I couldn't endure.

439
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.919
I never told you to endure, though.

440
00:27:43.093 --> 00:27:46.791
You rejected all of my
goodwill toward you.

441
00:27:48.599 --> 00:27:50.106
You said that you'd do it yourself.

442
00:27:50.106 --> 00:27:52.148
You made me do something
that I couldn't handle.

443
00:27:54.719 --> 00:27:57.629
Do you know how difficult it is...

444
00:27:57.629 --> 00:27:59.723
to say that you can't
endure something?

445
00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:02.717
Everyone else told me
to hang in there.

446
00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:06.467
But that isn't the work
that I wrote.

447
00:28:08.084 --> 00:28:10.110
That's not what I wanted to say.

448
00:28:10.798 --> 00:28:13.588
But they said that everything will be
solved if I just endured this.

449
00:28:14.469 --> 00:28:16.753
How does that make any sense?

450
00:28:20.736 --> 00:28:23.437
I endured this because I wanted
my work to be on TV.

451
00:28:26.136 --> 00:28:27.694
Director Min...

452
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:31.386
sent me multiple signs indicating
that he had different thoughts.

453
00:28:31.386 --> 00:28:34.206
But I ignored it, because
I wanted to like him.

455
00:28:42.658 --> 00:28:45.046
If my name was credited on the

456
00:28:46.392 --> 00:28:50.294
my parents would be happy, and those
around me would see me in a new light.

457
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.043
I threw away the innocent thought of
wanting to tell my story while I held on.

458
00:29:02.405 --> 00:29:04.132
I felt that, if I endured this...

459
00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:11.019
I thought it'd be difficult to return to
being to the person I truly want to be.

460
00:29:16.633 --> 00:29:18.969
Was that so wrong of me?

461
00:29:51.604 --> 00:29:53.236
Oh, I told myself I wasn't going to cry.
