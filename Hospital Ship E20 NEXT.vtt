00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:09.902
(Episode 20)

2
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.491
What's all this?

3
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.261
- Aren't these Ms. Choi's things? - She won't work here.

4
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.871
She said she'll send someone to get her things.

5
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.200
She has 2 arms and 2 legs. Can't she take them herself?

6
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.170
Why is she sending someone else?

7
00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.718
- That's odd. - What is?

8
00:00:39.718 --> 00:00:41.278
Could it be...

9
00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:43.818
No, no.

10
00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:45.818
Could it be what?

11
00:00:46.218 --> 00:00:47.858
Do you think Ms. Choi...

12
00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.388
has leukemia?

13
00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:54.629
Leukemia?

14
00:00:56.928 --> 00:00:59.229
What nonsense is that?

15
00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.468
Then why else would Dr. Kwak be looking it up...

16
00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:04.209
whenever he can?

17
00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.679
Starting exactly the day Ms. Choi left to go to hospital.

18
00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.509
All this is so strange too.

19
00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.849
She forced her way into our dorm,

20
00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:16.819
and now, she's moving out.

21
00:01:17.218 --> 00:01:19.718
I guess you have a point.

22
00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.298
Hello?

23
00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:33.498
She refused the test?

24
00:01:33.768 --> 00:01:36.869
I sent her home thinking she was just too anxious.

25
00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.138
You gave me your diagnosis.

26
00:01:39.238 --> 00:01:41.778
That was based on the records she'd brought.

27
00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.849
I need to test her to set up a treatment plan.

28
00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:50.089
Unless it's a transplant, chemotherapy is her best bet.

29
00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:51.949
Let me call her.

30
00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.028
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

31
00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:08.539
Hello? Young Eun?

32
00:02:08.638 --> 00:02:10.638
It's Woo Jae.

33
00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:17.779
Dr. Song.

34
00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.819
Don't tell my sister for now.

35
00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.988
- What is it? - It's nothing.

36
00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.759
Where are you going? It's a weekend.

37
00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.629
To work at the ER.

38
00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.259
Take care.

39
00:02:49.578 --> 00:02:51.208
- Hello. - Where are you?

40
00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:53.749
- At my dorm. - Shall we have lunch?

41
00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.018
I have an ER shift.

42
00:02:55.018 --> 00:02:57.388
Take your time. I sent a car for you.

43
00:03:29.578 --> 00:03:30.719
Please.

44
00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.618
Must I take a boat too?

45
00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:36.428
It's not far away. Just a 10-minute ride.

46
00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:17.868
We get off here.

47
00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:30.508
Hello. She just got off.

48
00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.969
Does your dad really have cancer?

49
00:05:26.068 --> 00:05:28.698
- I think so. - How do you know?

50
00:05:31.868 --> 00:05:35.079
Here's the written diagnosis he got in China.

51
00:05:36.808 --> 00:05:40.378
It's a mix of Chinese and English, so I don't know for sure,

52
00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:41.748
but isn't cancer...

53
00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:43.988
what I think it is?

54
00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.959
Is it bad?

55
00:05:51.688 --> 00:05:53.428
Where is he right now?

56
00:05:54.128 --> 00:05:56.529
How bad is it?

57
00:06:12.008 --> 00:06:13.149
You're late.

58
00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.219
What are you doing here?

59
00:06:17.318 --> 00:06:19.289
Did you forget I'm his son?

60
00:06:21.858 --> 00:06:23.229
It's a family gathering.

61
00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:25.988
You're our guest.

62
00:06:27.798 --> 00:06:28.998
Feeling the pressure?

63
00:06:32.198 --> 00:06:35.099
The next step might make you feel worse.

64
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:39.469
Come along.

65
00:06:59.188 --> 00:07:00.399
Dad.

66
00:07:02.128 --> 00:07:05.469
- Hello. - Hello, sir.

67
00:07:07.198 --> 00:07:09.839
Dr. Song, come closer to me.

68
00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:14.709
- Jae Geol, excuse us. - Okay.

69
00:07:15.608 --> 00:07:18.479
What did I say? I said you'd feel worse.

70
00:07:18.678 --> 00:07:19.849
Good luck.

71
00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:29.019
Have you...

72
00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:31.928
ever been fishing before?

73
00:07:32.488 --> 00:07:33.698
It's my first time.

74
00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:36.198
You should try it.

75
00:07:36.198 --> 00:07:39.099
It's a perfect hobby for surgeons like us.

76
00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:42.039
It's good to zone out...

77
00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:44.909
and think about nothing every now and then.

78
00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.508
You can't do that yet, can you?

79
00:07:53.318 --> 00:07:56.919
Did you know that this used to be a deserted island?

80
00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:59.149
No, I didn't know.

81
00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:02.818
A fisherman found it when he was...

82
00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:05.358
washed up here in a storm.

83
00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:08.758
To him, the storm was a crisis,

84
00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:10.399
but he cared for the island...

85
00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:12.729
and made it what it is now.

86
00:08:12.729 --> 00:08:16.539
It turned out to be a great opportunity.

87
00:08:20.308 --> 00:08:21.539
I think...

88
00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:26.448
you are like this island to my family.

89
00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:30.889
My wife met a storm...

90
00:08:32.188 --> 00:08:35.489
and you provided the perfect shelter.

91
00:08:36.318 --> 00:08:39.289
- No, sir, I only... - Now, it's our turn.

92
00:08:41.698 --> 00:08:44.629
Like the fisherman tended to this island,

93
00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:48.438
it's our turn to look after you and support you.

94
00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:53.909
Okay.

95
00:08:54.678 --> 00:08:57.208
Let's go. Lunch is ready.

96
00:08:57.208 --> 00:08:58.279
Okay.

97
00:09:11.058 --> 00:09:12.958
We could have eaten out,

98
00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.499
but I wanted to serve you home-cooked food.

99
00:09:15.499 --> 00:09:18.428
I asked the owners to lend me the kitchen.

100
00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:22.039
We're good friends with the family.

101
00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:23.139
I see.

102
00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:25.039
Please, eat.

103
00:09:25.769 --> 00:09:27.708
I hope you like my cooking.

104
00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:29.978
You know how good a cook you are.

105
00:09:29.978 --> 00:09:31.448
I'm an intellectual,

106
00:09:31.448 --> 00:09:33.649
and an intellectual must be humble.

107
00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:35.718
Ignore her, and eat.

108
00:09:35.718 --> 00:09:38.249
You'll starve trying to keep up with her chatting.

109
00:09:38.249 --> 00:09:39.958
How could you?

110
00:09:53.698 --> 00:09:56.169
- Is it just ringing? - Yes.

111
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:57.609
Try again.

112
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:03.048
(Heo Jeong Rim)

113
00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:11.448
- Hello? - Did you call?

114
00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:17.958
Yes. To ask if you know where Young Eun is.

115
00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.558
She's with me.

116
00:10:20.058 --> 00:10:21.659
Can you put her on?

117
00:10:22.058 --> 00:10:23.869
She just went out.

118
00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:28.399
She must be feeling okay then.

119
00:10:28.568 --> 00:10:32.438
Yes. She doesn't look too bad.

120
00:10:32.869 --> 00:10:35.178
What's going on?

121
00:10:35.178 --> 00:10:37.078
Did you two get back together?

122
00:10:37.948 --> 00:10:39.478
Call me when she comes back.

123
00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:41.978
If she won't, you can.

124
00:10:43.188 --> 00:10:44.688
Thanks. Bye.

125
00:10:53.698 --> 00:10:55.058
Is it still ringing?

126
00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:59.968
He used to pick up.

127
00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:03.968
What if he's passed out somewhere?

128
00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:05.708
What if that's why he won't answer?

129
00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:07.708
What then?

130
00:11:08.178 --> 00:11:09.678
Don't get too scared.

131
00:11:13.249 --> 00:11:16.519
You said you got him the phone, right?

132
00:11:17.489 --> 00:11:19.348
- Yes. - In whose name?

133
00:11:19.448 --> 00:11:21.989
Mine, just in case.

134
00:11:24.688 --> 00:11:26.129
Track it down.

135
00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:28.558
If it's in your name, you can trace it.

136
00:11:28.558 --> 00:11:30.669
You're right, I can.

137
00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:31.999
(Locate my device)

138
00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:43.379
- This is... - Do you know where that is?

139
00:11:43.909 --> 00:11:44.978
Yes.

140
00:11:46.818 --> 00:11:48.619
Do you have a car?

141
00:11:59.558 --> 00:12:02.399
- Try this as well. - Thank you.

142
00:12:05.828 --> 00:12:07.598
Come on, eat up.

143
00:12:08.698 --> 00:12:10.968
You're too thin.

144
00:12:12.539 --> 00:12:13.838
I am trying.

145
00:12:24.718 --> 00:12:27.289
- Sorry, it's the hospital. - Take it.

146
00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.098
Dr. Kang?

147
00:12:36.468 --> 00:12:37.769
Okay.

148
00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:42.269
What is it?

149
00:12:43.169 --> 00:12:44.409
They need me.

150
00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:46.338
I got Dr. Kang to replace you.

151
00:12:46.978 --> 00:12:49.139
He can't work. He has acute gastroenteritis.

152
00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:50.578
(Symptoms are vomiting and diarrhea.)

153
00:12:50.578 --> 00:12:53.119
- Okay, you should go. - Oh dear.

154
00:12:53.218 --> 00:12:55.218
You didn't even finish your meal.

155
00:12:55.218 --> 00:12:56.588
Take her there.

156
00:12:57.289 --> 00:12:59.548
- Yes, keep her safe. - Okay.

157
00:13:04.058 --> 00:13:05.159
Goodbye.

158
00:13:23.183 --> 00:13:26.415
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 20 Hospital Ship "Shall We Get Married?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

159
00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:43.928
Get in.

160
00:13:58.208 --> 00:13:59.478
Wear your seatbelt.

161
00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:02.149
Or I'll help if you want some romance.

162
00:14:37.218 --> 00:14:38.249
Dad.

163
00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:39.989
Dad.

164
00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:43.629
- Sir. Sir. - Dad.

165
00:14:43.859 --> 00:14:46.129
Dad, wake up. What's wrong with you?

166
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:48.359
Is he okay? Is he?

167
00:14:48.698 --> 00:14:51.399
Wake up, Dad.

168
00:14:57.539 --> 00:14:59.009
Did you enjoy fishing?

169
00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:01.208
I don't know.

170
00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:04.149
He doesn't fish with just anyone.

171
00:15:04.609 --> 00:15:06.779
He chooses his partners with great care.

172
00:15:07.318 --> 00:15:09.119
What are the criteria?

173
00:15:09.119 --> 00:15:11.688
Family or comrades.

174
00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:13.218
I'm neither.

175
00:15:13.218 --> 00:15:14.989
I think you're both.

176
00:15:15.818 --> 00:15:17.989
It looks like my dad wants you...

177
00:15:17.989 --> 00:15:20.428
to be his family and comrade.

178
00:15:22.198 --> 00:15:23.598
Shall we get married?

179
00:15:24.828 --> 00:15:26.769
We need someone to inherit the hospital.

180
00:15:26.769 --> 00:15:28.468
I'm not in the right field.

181
00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:31.009
I think he wants to leave it to you.

182
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:33.938
As his daughter-in-law.

183
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:37.149
Are you interested?

184
00:15:37.649 --> 00:15:38.779
Sure.

185
00:15:39.409 --> 00:15:41.149
Is it that easy?

186
00:15:42.048 --> 00:15:44.749
Why should it be hard? I get a hospital.

187
00:15:45.619 --> 00:15:46.919
You don't like me.

188
00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:50.359
No, I do like you.

189
00:15:52.228 --> 00:15:54.198
You really don't like me.

190
00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:56.669
If you got that, focus on driving.

191
00:15:59.198 --> 00:16:01.968
What about Hyun? Do you like him?

192
00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:06.838
No, that's...

193
00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:19.789
This is interesting.

194
00:16:43.808 --> 00:16:46.009
I feel quite invigorated.

195
00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:48.279
I like it when it's complicated.

196
00:16:48.818 --> 00:16:50.289
Especially when the woman's tough.

197
00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:56.019
Dad... Dad...

198
00:16:57.289 --> 00:16:58.789
- Dad. - Woo Jae.

199
00:16:58.928 --> 00:17:01.298
- Sis! - He needs to get inside.

200
00:17:01.298 --> 00:17:04.299
His temperature's 38.5℃, and his vitals are unstable.

201
00:17:07.639 --> 00:17:09.708
Did he just call you "sis"?

202
00:17:10.038 --> 00:17:11.409
Is he your brother?

203
00:17:12.708 --> 00:17:14.778
Who's the patient?

204
00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:22.379
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

205
00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:24.549
Hook him up.

206
00:17:25.448 --> 00:17:27.718
Sir. Sir, wake up. Where are you?

207
00:17:27.718 --> 00:17:30.589
Sir. Sir? Let me see.

208
00:17:30.688 --> 00:17:32.458
He's badly jaundiced.

209
00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.928
Check his temperature. 38.5℃?

210
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:39.399
Get the ultrasound, and call for a CT.

211
00:17:39.399 --> 00:17:41.498
- Okay. - Let's see why he's jaundiced.

212
00:17:41.569 --> 00:17:44.038
- Doctor, look at this. - What is it?

213
00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:45.639
His written diagnosis from China.

214
00:17:45.768 --> 00:17:48.109
According to this, he has biliary tract cancer.

215
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.438
What?

216
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:54.018
Then the jaundice and septicemia is all because...

217
00:17:54.018 --> 00:17:56.278
the tumor blocked his biliary tract?

218
00:17:58.448 --> 00:18:00.059
Did you know about this?

219
00:18:03.159 --> 00:18:05.389
Eun Jae, what should we do?

220
00:18:05.389 --> 00:18:07.659
What will happen to him now?

221
00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:12.198
Wait here, Woo Jae.

222
00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:18.109
- Dad. - This is serious.

223
00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:23.948
Doctor.

224
00:18:25.178 --> 00:18:26.278
Dr. Song.

225
00:19:12.589 --> 00:19:14.728
It's cardiac arrest. Get the defibrillator.

226
00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:16.799
- Dad. - Get him out!

227
00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:18.028
- Dad, no! - Now!

228
00:19:18.028 --> 00:19:20.299
Dad! Let go of me.

229
00:19:23.409 --> 00:19:24.569
Dad.

230
00:19:25.409 --> 00:19:26.678
Calm down.

231
00:19:28.278 --> 00:19:29.579
Charge to 200 joules!

232
00:19:33.718 --> 00:19:35.349
Clear. Get back!

233
00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:36.988
Shock.

234
00:19:41.018 --> 00:19:42.389
Charge to 300 joules.

235
00:19:46.458 --> 00:19:49.198
Clear. Get back. Shock.

236
00:19:59.008 --> 00:20:00.409
Get the ultrasound.

237
00:20:01.079 --> 00:20:02.708
- Dr. Song. - A fever and jaundice...

238
00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:04.909
are signs of acute biliary tract cancer.

239
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:06.849
We must check and do a PTBD.

240
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:09.248
- Will you do it yourself? - Yes.

241
00:20:09.748 --> 00:20:10.919
You don't have to.

242
00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.319
We can get a radiologist to do it.

243
00:20:13.319 --> 00:20:14.659
If we don't do it now,

244
00:20:14.659 --> 00:20:16.788
all his organs will fail.

245
00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:18.589
- Nurse. - Okay.

246
00:20:21.498 --> 00:20:22.799
What's going on?

247
00:20:22.928 --> 00:20:24.869
They'll insert thoracic drain in the bile duct.

248
00:20:24.968 --> 00:20:27.299
It's her father. Will she do it herself?

249
00:20:39.748 --> 00:20:42.678
The infection is caused by a tumor that clogged biliary tract.

250
00:20:42.919 --> 00:20:45.748
We'll insert a thoracic drain here...

251
00:20:45.988 --> 00:20:47.718
to remove excessive bile.

252
00:20:48.089 --> 00:20:50.329
This will treat septicemia.

253
00:20:54.928 --> 00:20:58.399
He's your father. Can you really do it?

254
00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:06.839
Let's start.

255
00:21:52.988 --> 00:21:54.059
What happened?

256
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:55.688
Go inside.

257
00:22:08.369 --> 00:22:11.208
Doctor Song. I got a call from the operation room.

258
00:22:11.208 --> 00:22:12.609
There's an emergency operation.

259
00:22:13.309 --> 00:22:15.379
- I'll go upstairs now. - Okay.

260
00:22:16.109 --> 00:22:17.109
What?

261
00:22:18.678 --> 00:22:21.778
Can't she take a break from operations today?

262
00:22:22.218 --> 00:22:23.549
Can they call someone else?

263
00:22:23.889 --> 00:22:25.849
Of course, it's possible.

264
00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:27.059
Then why?

265
00:22:27.288 --> 00:22:28.659
She doesn't want that.

266
00:22:29.319 --> 00:22:30.829
She said it herself.

267
00:22:31.359 --> 00:22:32.428
I'm leaving.

268
00:23:42.528 --> 00:23:44.299
Dad, Dad.

269
00:23:46.069 --> 00:23:47.069
Yes.

270
00:23:48.038 --> 00:23:49.198
Are you awake?

271
00:23:52.109 --> 00:23:53.109
Yes.

272
00:23:54.438 --> 00:23:55.909
Gosh.

273
00:23:58.278 --> 00:24:01.049
I thought you were going to die.

274
00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:05.919
Where am I?

275
00:24:07.159 --> 00:24:09.559
We're at a hospital where Eun Jae works.

276
00:24:20.738 --> 00:24:23.768
(Operating Room)

277
00:24:27.478 --> 00:24:28.508
Good job.

278
00:24:29.708 --> 00:24:31.109
Your father is awake.

279
00:24:31.349 --> 00:24:33.819
His fever is gone, and the vitals are normal.

280
00:24:37.948 --> 00:24:39.889
He's in the new building.

281
00:24:41.188 --> 00:24:42.389
He's in the VIP room.

282
00:24:42.758 --> 00:24:45.389
Compared to big hospitals in Seoul,

283
00:24:45.829 --> 00:24:47.258
it's not really VIP.

284
00:24:49.829 --> 00:24:51.399
That wasn't necessary.

285
00:24:51.899 --> 00:24:53.369
Of course, it was.

286
00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:55.768
Think of all the lives you've saved.

287
00:24:56.538 --> 00:24:59.978
Among them is the wife of the hospital director.

288
00:25:01.139 --> 00:25:03.708
You deserve such a privilege.

289
00:25:04.609 --> 00:25:05.678
Just enjoy it.

290
00:25:20.428 --> 00:25:21.498
Hyun.

291
00:25:22.198 --> 00:25:23.928
- Hey. - What are you doing here?

292
00:25:24.028 --> 00:25:26.129
- I was looking everywhere for you. - Did you eat dinner?

293
00:25:26.329 --> 00:25:28.738
I enjoyed it. Thank you.

294
00:25:31.508 --> 00:25:34.438
Dad wants to see you for a minute.

295
00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:36.579
He wants to see me?

296
00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:58.968
- Hello. - Hello, sir.

297
00:25:59.268 --> 00:26:01.069
Woo Jae told me.

298
00:26:02.139 --> 00:26:03.339
You're the one...

299
00:26:05.508 --> 00:26:08.678
who saved my life.

300
00:26:09.339 --> 00:26:12.178
No, I didn't do much.

301
00:26:14.819 --> 00:26:16.389
Doctor.

302
00:26:17.819 --> 00:26:18.849
How could I...

303
00:26:19.788 --> 00:26:21.718
repay you for what you've done?

304
00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:23.228
Don't say that.

305
00:26:23.528 --> 00:26:25.359
You can speak casually with me, sir.

306
00:26:26.129 --> 00:26:27.129
Goodness.

307
00:26:30.428 --> 00:26:31.629
Shall I?

308
00:26:33.369 --> 00:26:34.438
Yes.

309
00:26:36.768 --> 00:26:39.238
I wanted to see you because...

310
00:26:44.309 --> 00:26:45.778
I'd like to...

311
00:26:47.018 --> 00:26:48.049
ask you a favor...

312
00:26:48.778 --> 00:26:51.089
without letting Eun Jae know.

313
00:27:07.339 --> 00:27:09.538
Since you saved my life,

314
00:27:14.379 --> 00:27:15.579
could you...

315
00:27:16.609 --> 00:27:18.248
help me out a bit more?

316
00:27:19.678 --> 00:27:21.149
What do you mean?

317
00:27:32.788 --> 00:27:35.028
Your father is much better now.

318
00:27:36.768 --> 00:27:37.799
Thank you.

319
00:27:41.369 --> 00:27:44.968
I subscribed to a cancer insurance plan a month ago.

320
00:27:46.579 --> 00:27:49.238
If I'm diagnosed with cancer...

321
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:54.018
90 days after the subscription, I get paid 15,000 dollars.

322
00:27:54.678 --> 00:27:55.748
I have 10 plans.

323
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:59.248
Until then, there can't be any...

324
00:28:00.258 --> 00:28:02.018
records of diagnosis.

325
00:28:04.258 --> 00:28:06.129
I don't understand what you mean.

326
00:28:12.129 --> 00:28:13.169
The fact that...

327
00:28:13.768 --> 00:28:16.839
I was diagnosed with cancer today...

328
00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:18.938
must be deleted.

329
00:28:20.178 --> 00:28:21.178
Are you...

330
00:28:22.778 --> 00:28:24.349
asking me to...

331
00:28:26.178 --> 00:28:28.079
He's asking you to alter his chart.

332
00:28:35.258 --> 00:28:36.458
Stay outside.

333
00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:39.359
Come out.

334
00:28:40.758 --> 00:28:42.258
Don't listen to his nonsense.

335
00:28:42.928 --> 00:28:43.968
Come out now.
