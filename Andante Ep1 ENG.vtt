<i>[Episode 1: First Death]</i>

00:00:57.874 --> 00:01:00.110
<i>That guy is acting up again.</i>

6
00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:08.151
I may not have that weapon,
but I can beat the likes of you.

7
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.953
Huh? Okay. Hey.

8
00:01:09.953 --> 00:01:13.924
Attack. Hey, you have to protect me.
What are you doing?

9
00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:18.462
Okay, turn around. You're on defense.

10
00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:20.797
We have to do this all at once,
all at once.

11
00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:28.939
Okay, let's go. Let's go!

12
00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.175
Hey, hey, hey. Get them.

13
00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:34.211
Okay!

14
00:01:37.214 --> 00:01:38.982
Hey, you see that?

15
00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:41.084
I told you all to listen to me.

16
00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:44.187
You have to do this and this to win.

17
00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.856
Look at this.

18
00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:48.291
All you need to do is listen to me.

19
00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:56.500
<i>It's Mom!</i>

20
00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:04.674
<i>The speed of light is not
just a turn of phrase.</i>

21
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.447
<i>There are times when a person can
actually move at the speed of light.</i>

22
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.031
Are you asleep?

23
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:30.333
No. I'm going to study a little more.

24
00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.470
Your face is so thin
from all that studying.

25
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.105
Don't push yourself too hard.

26
00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:36.673
Okay.

27
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:43.380
By the way...

28
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:46.016
you're in here alone, right?

29
00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:47.083
Why?

30
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:50.854
I thought I heard someone yelling
from your room.

31
00:02:51.555 --> 00:02:52.789
Was it the neighbors?

32
00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:56.893
Was it this?

33
00:02:56.893 --> 00:02:59.162
I had it on loud a moment ago.

34
00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:04.100
Oh... turn off the lights before bed.

35
00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.946
<i>Oh, hey. Follow him. Follow him.</i>

36
00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:18.982
No one is watching.
I'll never make money.

37
00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:21.084
Would you watch a crappy thing like that?

38
00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.354
Who would watch trash like that?

39
00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:26.523
It's better than that trash
you're wearing.

40
00:03:28.358 --> 00:03:30.360
Oh, I wish my eyes had never seen it.

41
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.661
Just take care yourself.

42
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:33.863
I told you to call me Older Brother.

43
00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:35.932
You have the mentality
of a little child.

44
00:03:35.932 --> 00:03:37.634
- How dare you!
- You.

45
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.303
I noticed you even fabricated
your report card this time.

46
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.340
- How did you...
- Should I tell Mom the truth?

47
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.374
No.

48
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:46.776
Go to sleep.

49
00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:49.713
Are you going to the convenience store?
Bring me back banana ice cream.

50
00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:51.681
You know I don't have money.

51
00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:52.682
Really?

52
00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:56.319
Then should I wake up Mom
and tell her?

53
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:01.358
Okay. Banana, banana.

54
00:04:01.358 --> 00:04:03.360
A beverage would be nice too.

55
00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:32.856
Hey, who are you?

56
00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:36.626
Do you know him?

57
00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:39.963
Jae Hoon.

58
00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:44.134
No, I don't know him.

59
00:04:44.768 --> 00:04:45.802
Shi Kyung...

60
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.507
You two know each other?
Get over here.

61
00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:54.444
Get over here. Hey, get over here.

62
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:10.727
Hey! Go that way.

63
00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.638
Gosh, that little rat.

64
00:05:21.638 --> 00:05:23.907
Wait until I catch you!

65
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:42.292
Hi.

66
00:05:43.293 --> 00:05:46.162
What can you do? I know
this place like the back of my hand.

67
00:05:46.162 --> 00:05:49.599
Sorry, you can take everything I have.

68
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.243
Sorry, but I'm on a diet.

69
00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:01.978
My girlfriend says I need to lose weight.

70
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.181
Don't you have anything else
besides this?

71
00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:17.494
Punk... you didn't waste my time.

72
00:06:18.395 --> 00:06:20.830
Don't you have any credit cards?

73
00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.166
No.

74
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.873
Next time, get some cards.

75
00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:35.979
I'm going enjoy eating this.

76
00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.118
Darn it.

77
00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:45.488
What? Jae Hoon reported me?

78
00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:46.523
Yes.

79
00:06:46.523 --> 00:06:49.959
But, why would he report me?

80
00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.095
He said you were a witness.

81
00:06:52.095 --> 00:06:53.963
I heard you saw Jae Hoon being attacked.

82
00:06:55.098 --> 00:06:57.467
Were you beat up too?

83
00:06:57.467 --> 00:07:00.036
No... I fell.

84
00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:02.605
You need to tell us the truth.

85
00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:06.242
This won't do.
Tell your mother to come by.

86
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.244
I'll be a witness.

87
00:07:08.244 --> 00:07:10.547
Is it that difficult for your mother
to come by once?

88
00:07:10.547 --> 00:07:11.614
She's busy.

89
00:07:17.887 --> 00:07:19.656
Witness? You?

90
00:07:20.457 --> 00:07:23.126
Are you sure you're a witness?
You weren't fighting too?

91
00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:24.427
What happened to your face?

92
00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:26.529
No, I told you I fell.

93
00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:30.300
Aunt, he can't fight.
He always loses to me.

94
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.935
Lee Shi Young.

95
00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:34.471
You're going to say I shouldn't
talk to my brother that way

96
00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:36.539
and to not use my cell phone
at the table.

97
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:37.874
You know, so why do it?

98
00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.844
You know your nagging is useless,
so why do you keep doing it, Mom?

99
00:07:40.844 --> 00:07:43.046
- What?
- You continue to nag.

100
00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.047
I keep acting this way.

101
00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:47.183
What's the difference?
Neither of us changes our habits.

102
00:07:47.183 --> 00:07:49.452
Hey, how is that the same?

103
00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:50.553
You sure talk well.

104
00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:53.056
Forget it. Let's stop talking about it.

105
00:07:55.592 --> 00:07:58.595
Hey, Lee Shi Young. Come back here.

106
00:07:58.595 --> 00:07:59.896
Shi Kyung.

107
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:05.435
<i>At times like this, Aunt,
I am very thankful for you.</i>

108
00:08:05.435 --> 00:08:08.304
<i>Nothing good will come
by following her.</i>

109
00:08:08.304 --> 00:08:09.873
Seriously, now.

110
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.544
Now that I think about it,
I haven't visited the kids' school.

111
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.750
But, I suppose it would be odd
to visit out of the blue.

112
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.190
- Yeah!
- He hasn't died yet.

113
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.691
Wow. Amazing.

114
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:30.693
That's awesome.

115
00:08:30.693 --> 00:08:33.096
Wow, this is seriously amazing.

116
00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:35.999
<i>Son, you're at school, right?</i>

117
00:08:38.902 --> 00:08:40.837
<i>Of course, I'm studying hard.</i>

118
00:08:42.472 --> 00:08:44.941
<i>Okay, study hard. See you soon.</i>

119
00:08:46.042 --> 00:08:48.411
<i>I'm finishing up self-study time
and going to the cafe.</i>

120
00:09:00.557 --> 00:09:02.025
Oh, too bad

121
00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:03.560
He was winning.

122
00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:07.797
Aunt! Aunt, Aunt.

123
00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.632
Aunt, where's Mom?

124
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:10.633
Why isn't she picking up?

125
00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.436
I don't know. She told me
to watch the cafe and left.

126
00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:16.573
That's strange. Is it a short circuit?

127
00:09:16.573 --> 00:09:18.308
This made a buzzing sound.

128
00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:19.809
You can fix electrical issues, right?

129
00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.312
<i>No way. Impossible.</i>

130
00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:25.214
<i>Mom isn't the type to visit school.</i>

131
00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:28.184
<i>Why do I feel so anxious?</i>

132
00:09:28.184 --> 00:09:29.953
<i>"See you soon"?</i>

133
00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:32.689
I asked you if you can fix this!

134
00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:35.525
Aunt, did Mom mention
going to my school?

135
00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:38.661
Oh yeah. She said she was going.

136
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.531
She said last night that
she was going to your school.

137
00:09:45.568 --> 00:09:47.003
<i>I must stop her!</i>

138
00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:51.874
<i>As soon as Mom meets my homeroom teacher,
my entire ecosystem will end.</i>

139
00:10:00.717 --> 00:10:03.186
Are you really Shi Kyung's
homeroom teacher?

140
00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:08.358
His homeroom teacher must have changed.

141
00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:11.094
- No, it hasn't.
- What?

142
00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.565
That's strange. I thought it was a man.

143
00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:17.734
I'm glad you came though.

144
00:10:17.734 --> 00:10:21.471
I told Shi Kyung I wanted to meet
his mother, yet you never came.

145
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:23.239
You never answered your phone either.

146
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.476
- Excuse me?
- I'm sure you must know.

147
00:10:26.476 --> 00:10:28.645
Shi Kyung is a severe case.

148
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.682
Severe case? In what way?

149
00:10:32.682 --> 00:10:37.220
His grades went up a lot recently, and
he stays up late studying every night.

150
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.356
He stays up late listening
to lectures on the internet.

151
00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:44.293
Shi Kyung's grades went up?

152
00:10:45.662 --> 00:10:46.696
Yes.

153
00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:49.365
This is his last report card.

154
00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:52.402
I brought it for us to discuss.

155
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.870
Here you go.

156
00:11:21.064 --> 00:11:24.333
This is a fake, ma'am.

157
00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:25.334
What?

158
00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.504
I never thought Shi Kyung
would do something like this.

159
00:11:35.378 --> 00:11:38.181
These are Shi Kyung's real grades.

160
00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:39.582
They are progressively declining.

161
00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:53.730
Mom!

162
00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:59.502
Why didn't you tell me you were
planning to come to school?

163
00:12:01.237 --> 00:12:02.472
What about my homeroom teacher?

164
00:12:03.673 --> 00:12:04.674
Did you two meet?

165
00:12:06.876 --> 00:12:08.778
No. Why?

166
00:12:08.778 --> 00:12:10.246
Well, the thing is...

167
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:13.850
my homeroom teacher is away at a funeral.

168
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.184
You probably can't reach him.

169
00:12:15.184 --> 00:12:16.552
Is that so?

170
00:12:16.552 --> 00:12:18.087
You know that number I gave you?

171
00:12:18.955 --> 00:12:20.189
You can call that number.

172
00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:22.859
Why did you come today of all days?

173
00:12:22.859 --> 00:12:25.228
I jumped over walls, rushing to get here.

174
00:12:28.765 --> 00:12:29.799
Mom?

175
00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:32.435
Mother?

176
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.839
Oh... all right.

177
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:37.874
I'll call.

178
00:12:39.308 --> 00:12:42.245
But... why are you here?

179
00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:43.246
Me?

180
00:12:44.547 --> 00:12:46.115
Ah, well...

181
00:12:47.817 --> 00:12:50.686
I had to buy a workbook,
so I came by.

182
00:12:52.088 --> 00:12:54.824
Then, I wanted to go
to the cafe. You know how it is.

183
00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:59.996
Aunt said you were at school, and
you weren't picking up your phone.

184
00:12:59.996 --> 00:13:01.397
So, I ran over.

185
00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.668
Okay, you should head inside.

186
00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.004
Okay, I will.

187
00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:09.772
I have lots to study.

188
00:13:11.174 --> 00:13:13.709
Where's your workbook? You didn't buy it?

189
00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:16.479
Workbook? What workbook?

190
00:13:17.613 --> 00:13:18.681
Ah!

191
00:13:20.283 --> 00:13:22.752
They didn't have it.
I'll go to a big bookstore tomorrow.

192
00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:26.689
All right. Get going.

193
00:13:47.543 --> 00:13:49.979
Hey... it's me.

194
00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:52.849
My mom might call you later.

195
00:13:54.217 --> 00:13:56.052
Well, what happened is...

196
00:13:57.053 --> 00:13:59.222
Never mind. I'll be right there.

197
00:14:14.136 --> 00:14:15.504
Please let go of me.

198
00:14:15.504 --> 00:14:16.572
Hey.

199
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.008
What's your ranking?

200
00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:22.111
You can see, just by looking
at him... he's given up.

201
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:23.646
Given up on the exams and college.

202
00:14:23.646 --> 00:14:25.815
It's written all over his face.

203
00:14:25.815 --> 00:14:28.451
This guy is ranked number one,
our school's ace.

204
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:31.354
His father is the real power
behind our school.

205
00:14:31.354 --> 00:14:34.023
Do you know what I'm saying?

206
00:14:34.023 --> 00:14:35.124
Hey, shut up.

207
00:14:36.192 --> 00:14:39.295
My school record is too clean
to dirty it up with assault.

208
00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:42.899
Let's make sure it stays clean.

209
00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:45.835
Yeah, we were just joking around.

210
00:14:45.835 --> 00:14:47.436
Why is everyone overreacting?

211
00:14:47.436 --> 00:14:49.038
If you are going to be a witness...

212
00:14:49.038 --> 00:14:51.807
go and say "I don't know anything."

213
00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:53.609
"I heard wrong."

214
00:14:53.609 --> 00:14:55.411
You've seen that a lot on TV.

215
00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:57.046
Just don't go at all!

216
00:14:58.848 --> 00:15:00.149
If you attend as a witness...

217
00:15:01.117 --> 00:15:03.119
you are dead. Understand?

218
00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:07.556
Do you understand?

219
00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:10.159
What should we do?

220
00:15:11.027 --> 00:15:13.296
Should we review it again
in case you don't understand?

221
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.398
Huh?

222
00:15:27.543 --> 00:15:30.546
Gosh! Why are they picking on me?

223
00:15:36.152 --> 00:15:38.187
Did you not get enough sleep
at school today?

224
00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:39.221
You're very sensitive.

225
00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:42.325
You said your mom never met
your homeroom teacher.

226
00:15:44.093 --> 00:15:46.796
Is something else going on with you?

227
00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:49.398
- No.
- That's good then.

228
00:15:49.398 --> 00:15:52.535
Hey, don't come here and throw tantrums.

229
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:57.006
I'm sick and tired of dealing
with the temper tantrums of loser kids.

230
00:15:57.006 --> 00:15:58.708
I feel like things are going wrong.

231
00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.676
Hey, hey. Just be careful.

232
00:16:00.676 --> 00:16:02.645
You've been a bit much lately.

233
00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:04.447
Fabricating your report card?

234
00:16:05.281 --> 00:16:07.350
Isn't that practically a crime?

235
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.652
That's what I'm saying.
I think I've gone too far.

236
00:16:10.953 --> 00:16:12.755
I have a bad feeling about this and that.

237
00:16:13.522 --> 00:16:16.392
Just enjoy the ramen.

238
00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.861
Throw out the soup over there
when you're done.

239
00:16:25.634 --> 00:16:26.769
It's your mom.

240
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.338
Really? See, I told you.

241
00:16:29.338 --> 00:16:30.806
I knew she would call.

242
00:16:30.806 --> 00:16:33.275
Bro, you have to do a good job.

243
00:16:33.275 --> 00:16:34.810
You're at a funeral, okay?

244
00:16:36.812 --> 00:16:38.080
Okay.

245
00:16:39.448 --> 00:16:40.483
Hello.

246
00:16:40.483 --> 00:16:42.518
Yes. Hello, Shi Kyung's mother.

247
00:16:42.518 --> 00:16:44.987
I am Shi Kyung's homeroom teacher.

248
00:16:44.987 --> 00:16:46.522
Why are you calling?

249
00:16:46.522 --> 00:16:50.493
Me? I'm currently at a funeral.

250
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.729
What? You want to come here?

251
00:16:53.729 --> 00:16:54.730
No.

252
00:16:56.332 --> 00:17:00.269
That won't do.
I'm not in Seoul right now.

253
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:02.705
I'm far away... very far.

254
00:17:02.705 --> 00:17:05.808
Pardon me? Oh, where am I?

255
00:17:05.808 --> 00:17:07.309
Jeju Island... Jeju Island.

256
00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:10.046
I'm on Jeju Island.

257
00:17:10.046 --> 00:17:14.583
The father of my friend on Jeju Island
passed away suddenly.

258
00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:16.685
- I suddenly had to--
- I am in Jeju Island now.

259
00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:18.487
Homeroom Teacher.

260
00:17:18.487 --> 00:17:20.122
What?

261
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.024
What is it?

262
00:17:36.572 --> 00:17:39.241
That's hot! Oh, it's hot.

263
00:17:52.054 --> 00:17:55.891
Come home and show me all of the
internet lectures on your computer.

264
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:57.259
- No!
- Why?

265
00:17:57.259 --> 00:18:00.196
Why can't you?
What kind of lectures are they, exactly?

266
00:18:00.196 --> 00:18:03.165
Why are your grades so low
if you watch them every night?

267
00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:07.369
What could you be watching that would
turn you into one who fabricates grades?

268
00:18:07.369 --> 00:18:09.004
I'm so curious. I have to see it.

269
00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:12.108
No, you can't see it...
It will raise you blood pressure.

270
00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:14.043
It's porn, isn't it?

271
00:18:14.043 --> 00:18:16.245
Mom! How can you say that out loud?

272
00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.350
Did you see it when I wasn't there?
You can't do that!

273
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.755
That hurts.

274
00:18:26.755 --> 00:18:29.692
I heard you're ranked number one
at playing those games.

275
00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:32.628
What? You were watching
internet lectures all night?

276
00:18:33.462 --> 00:18:35.798
- Playing games and watching porn.
- Mom!

277
00:18:36.499 --> 00:18:37.666
No violence. Use words.

278
00:18:38.734 --> 00:18:39.768
Ouch!

279
00:18:39.768 --> 00:18:41.270
Words, yeah right.

280
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.038
Words are used for people.

281
00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:44.673
Are you even a person? Are you?

282
00:18:44.673 --> 00:18:46.709
All my friends do it!

283
00:18:48.277 --> 00:18:49.445
Where are you going?

284
00:18:49.445 --> 00:18:52.314
We're putting a stop to this today.

285
00:18:54.517 --> 00:18:55.551
Wait.

286
00:18:58.087 --> 00:18:59.855
Yes. Hello.

287
00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:02.124
Speaking.

288
00:19:03.459 --> 00:19:04.560
The police station?

289
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.229
<i>Whoever it is, thank you very much.</i>

290
00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:12.168
What?

291
00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:14.737
What did you say?

292
00:19:17.072 --> 00:19:20.643
<i>I'm sorry. I'll make sure
this doesn't happen again.</i>

293
00:19:20.643 --> 00:19:22.511
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

294
00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:24.013
<i>Sorry.</i>

295
00:19:28.951 --> 00:19:30.386
Why isn't Shi Young coming?

296
00:19:31.053 --> 00:19:32.087
I'll get her.

297
00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:41.664
We're sorry.

298
00:19:41.664 --> 00:19:43.332
- Bye.
- Bye.

299
00:19:50.339 --> 00:19:51.507
Why are you acting up too?

300
00:19:51.507 --> 00:19:53.642
Really, why are you acting like this?

301
00:19:53.642 --> 00:19:54.643
What did I do?

302
00:19:54.643 --> 00:19:57.913
Looking like this,
fighting with college students.

303
00:19:57.913 --> 00:19:59.682
It wasn't a fight.

304
00:19:59.682 --> 00:20:02.685
We had an argument,
she got a small scratch and...

305
00:20:02.685 --> 00:20:04.620
that college student totally overreacted.

306
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.654
So annoying.

307
00:20:05.654 --> 00:20:07.223
Gosh, seriously.

308
00:20:08.057 --> 00:20:10.793
Do you want to wear trash
and act like trash?

309
00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:11.994
What did you say? Trash?

310
00:20:11.994 --> 00:20:13.429
Stop it. That's enough.

311
00:20:14.096 --> 00:20:16.165
I really can't stand it.

312
00:20:19.101 --> 00:20:21.270
<i>[Jung Soo]</i>

313
00:20:33.682 --> 00:20:37.119
The electricity was acting up,
so I stepped out for a bit.

314
00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:40.089
These strange people came running in.

315
00:20:42.258 --> 00:20:43.592
Sis.

316
00:20:43.592 --> 00:20:48.564
They must work for the place we borrowed
money from when we were desperate.

317
00:20:49.732 --> 00:20:53.269
I pleaded with them
to wait just a little longer.

318
00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:14.023
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

319
00:21:14.023 --> 00:21:17.092
I used the children's father's
inheritance as collateral.

320
00:21:17.092 --> 00:21:19.061
Sorry. I'm very sorry.

321
00:21:21.764 --> 00:21:22.798
Who was that?

322
00:21:24.233 --> 00:21:25.467
Grandma.

323
00:21:25.467 --> 00:21:27.903
Why would Grandma call us?

324
00:21:27.903 --> 00:21:29.738
Did this happen to her house too?

325
00:21:34.443 --> 00:21:36.445
Let's move.

326
00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:37.513
What?

327
00:21:40.582 --> 00:21:42.651
I thought we had nowhere to go.

328
00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:43.852
We do have a place.

329
00:21:43.852 --> 00:21:45.254
Let's move.

330
00:21:45.254 --> 00:21:47.323
Mom, are you serious?

331
00:21:47.323 --> 00:21:49.892
Where are we going and when?

332
00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:51.894
I have to show up as a witness.

333
00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:54.496
We'll go as soon as we
lose this house to the bank.

334
00:21:54.496 --> 00:21:57.666
Will I have to transfer schools?
I don't want to!

335
00:21:57.666 --> 00:21:59.034
Listen carefully.

336
00:21:59.034 --> 00:22:01.904
From this point on, don't tell me
what you want or don't want.

337
00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.439
That is a luxury for us right now.

338
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.377
They say you need to die and come back
to life several times to become an adult.

339
00:22:08.377 --> 00:22:11.480
Consider this a death, and listen to me.

340
00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:15.217
Where, exactly, are we going?

341
00:22:15.217 --> 00:22:17.653
Where are we going?
You're scaring us like this.

342
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:34.136
Hey... I'm cold.

343
00:22:34.136 --> 00:22:35.537
Close it.

344
00:22:38.474 --> 00:22:40.776
Hey, I said I'm cold.

345
00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:44.146
Hey. It's cold.

346
00:22:45.714 --> 00:22:46.949
We'll probably get kicked out.

347
00:22:47.716 --> 00:22:48.717
Why?

348
00:22:48.717 --> 00:22:51.053
Will Grandma take us in?

349
00:22:51.053 --> 00:22:54.623
Don't you remember going there when we
were younger, and she wouldn't open up?

350
00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:55.657
Did she?

351
00:23:00.963 --> 00:23:02.531
- Hello.
- <i>Hey.</i>

352
00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:05.067
<i>Why would you call over something
as stupid as that?</i>

353
00:23:05.067 --> 00:23:06.101
Okay...

354
00:23:07.436 --> 00:23:08.437
Who is this?

355
00:23:10.239 --> 00:23:12.841
You've forgotten me already?

356
00:23:14.209 --> 00:23:15.744
I'm a little hurt.

357
00:23:16.378 --> 00:23:20.182
<i>I knew you wouldn't have
the courage to be a witness.</i>

358
00:23:20.182 --> 00:23:22.618
Be well, okay?

359
00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:25.454
<i>Be a coward, as usual.</i>

360
00:23:25.454 --> 00:23:26.889
I will do it!

361
00:23:31.126 --> 00:23:33.796
Hello? Hey!

362
00:23:35.297 --> 00:23:36.999
What was that? What's wrong?

363
00:23:37.766 --> 00:23:39.134
It's nothing.

364
00:23:45.107 --> 00:23:46.241
Are you going to transfer?

365
00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:50.712
Listen to me.

366
00:23:50.712 --> 00:23:52.080
Give that to me.

367
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.049
Let's just say we're going
to live in Seoul.

368
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:57.586
We can live at a friend's place
or rent a room.

369
00:23:57.586 --> 00:23:59.655
I don't want to live with Grandma.

370
00:23:59.655 --> 00:24:02.791
I don't want to either,
but that's not so easy.

371
00:24:02.791 --> 00:24:04.393
Mom could help...

372
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:17.473
Hey!

373
00:24:17.473 --> 00:24:20.142
Mom, my cell phone fell out of the car.

374
00:24:20.142 --> 00:24:22.211
Stop the car. Stop the car!

375
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:24.847
Mom... Mom!

376
00:24:24.847 --> 00:24:26.982
Mister, my phone fell out.

377
00:24:26.982 --> 00:24:29.618
Mister! Stop for a second.

378
00:24:29.618 --> 00:24:32.588
Mom, I'm paying for that
in 36 monthly installments.

379
00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:10.759
Wow!

380
00:25:28.644 --> 00:25:31.847
I'm already here.
I'm in front of Grandma's house.

381
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.984
Oh, that? I brought it.

382
00:25:35.984 --> 00:25:39.354
Okay, I got it. Just hurry up.

383
00:25:50.766 --> 00:25:54.303
<i>Jung Soo, Jung Soo, Jung Soo.</i>

384
00:25:57.072 --> 00:25:59.474
The GPS is giving me weird directions.

385
00:26:00.108 --> 00:26:01.510
Is the address wrong?

386
00:26:02.277 --> 00:26:03.579
Hold on, Mister.

387
00:26:04.346 --> 00:26:08.083
We're almost there,
and I'm confused. Where is it?

388
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:10.285
Is it over there?

389
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.340
What is that? They pretend
to be corpses here too?

390
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.341
Pretend to be corpses?

391
00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:34.142
Kids at my school do that a lot.

392
00:26:34.142 --> 00:26:35.811
But, I've never seen anyone do it alone.

393
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:37.846
What are you doing with my phone?

394
00:27:07.476 --> 00:27:10.846
Hey, what is this on my phone?

395
00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:15.317
Don't delete it.

396
00:27:47.616 --> 00:27:50.552
Mom! What are you going
to do about my phone?

397
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:56.491
What do you think you're doing!

398
00:28:05.567 --> 00:28:06.702
Mother.

399
00:28:07.903 --> 00:28:09.071
It's been a long time.

400
00:28:09.071 --> 00:28:13.442
I'm very sorry to show up,
with all our belongings, like this.

401
00:28:13.442 --> 00:28:16.344
You people... what is...

402
00:28:16.344 --> 00:28:20.182
There is no other way
for the three of us to live.

403
00:28:20.182 --> 00:28:22.784
They're your bloodline,
so please take us in.

404
00:28:22.784 --> 00:28:24.419
- Please.
- What?

405
00:28:25.187 --> 00:28:26.455
"Take us in"?

406
00:28:27.589 --> 00:28:31.226
After what happened to their father,
we never saw you again, Mother.

407
00:28:31.893 --> 00:28:34.963
So, I tried to do
whatever I could on my own.

408
00:28:37.532 --> 00:28:42.337
But, there is nowhere I can go
and nothing more I can do.

409
00:28:42.337 --> 00:28:43.538
I have no money either.

410
00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:46.241
Please help me.

411
00:28:46.241 --> 00:28:47.642
You must be crazy.

412
00:28:48.376 --> 00:28:50.679
You're wasting your time.
Go back.

413
00:29:13.869 --> 00:29:16.338
Shi... Shi...

414
00:29:17.072 --> 00:29:18.373
Shi Yoon.

415
00:29:19.141 --> 00:29:21.009
He's the eldest, Shi Kyung.

416
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:24.246
He looks very much like his father.

417
00:29:25.247 --> 00:29:28.049
But, he is a terrible student.

418
00:29:28.049 --> 00:29:31.586
He's addicted to games and even had
the guts to fabricate his report card.

419
00:29:33.321 --> 00:29:37.159
I don't know if you remember,
but this is Shi Young.

420
00:29:37.159 --> 00:29:40.629
I thought she was smart,
so I sent her to school a year early.

421
00:29:40.629 --> 00:29:42.964
Now, she's full of hot air and
goes around acting strange.

422
00:29:43.765 --> 00:29:45.867
What do you expect me to do?

423
00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:52.374
I was busy making a living, and
I couldn't focus on my children.

424
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:55.944
If I don't focus on them now,
I don't know what will happen to them.

425
00:29:56.545 --> 00:29:58.747
They are your grandchildren.
Please take them in.

426
00:29:58.747 --> 00:30:00.682
You raised them poorly.

427
00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:02.784
What do you expect me to do?

428
00:30:03.618 --> 00:30:04.653
There's nothing I can do.

429
00:30:06.288 --> 00:30:07.322
Go away.

430
00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.293
Mother, Mother.

431
00:30:17.499 --> 00:30:20.168
Mister, please unload the truck for now.

432
00:30:20.168 --> 00:30:22.070
What are you planning to do?

433
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.339
- What about the tent?
- It's here.

434
00:30:24.339 --> 00:30:27.375
Shi Kyung, unload the truck
with the driver.

435
00:30:28.143 --> 00:30:31.446
No, let's all unload the truck,
and then pitch the tent.

436
00:30:31.446 --> 00:30:33.815
Mom, we're pitching a tent.

437
00:30:33.815 --> 00:30:35.383
How? Why?

438
00:30:36.284 --> 00:30:38.420
<i>No, that's wrong.</i>

439
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.989
<i>Pull that side. Pull it.</i>

440
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.159
<i>Shi Kyung, are you not going
to pay attention?</i>

441
00:30:44.159 --> 00:30:45.994
Pull it hard, okay?

442
00:30:46.761 --> 00:30:47.896
Hold it.

443
00:30:51.466 --> 00:30:53.301
What is this?

444
00:30:53.301 --> 00:30:56.071
How many hours have the four
of us spent on this tent?

445
00:30:56.071 --> 00:30:58.673
- Then do it alone, Mom.
- What?

446
00:30:58.673 --> 00:31:00.909
You can't do it alone,
so why take it out on us?

447
00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:01.977
Shi Young.

448
00:31:01.977 --> 00:31:04.446
Aunt, are you sure this is a proper tent?

449
00:31:04.446 --> 00:31:07.315
I don't know. Your mom
just told me to bring it.

450
00:31:07.315 --> 00:31:10.452
Mom, suppose we do pitch it...

451
00:31:10.452 --> 00:31:12.754
do you really think we can sleep here?

452
00:31:12.754 --> 00:31:13.788
He's right.

453
00:31:13.788 --> 00:31:17.692
Not even for a night.
How can four people sleep in this?

454
00:31:17.692 --> 00:31:20.896
Do you think if we do this,
Grandma will pity us and open the door?

455
00:31:20.896 --> 00:31:22.964
So what if it makes no sense?

456
00:31:22.964 --> 00:31:25.934
Unless you have a better solution

457
00:31:25.934 --> 00:31:27.769
don't say another word
and put up the tent.

458
00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:29.537
Anything else would be
better than the tent.

459
00:31:29.537 --> 00:31:30.739
I hate this tent!

460
00:31:30.739 --> 00:31:32.674
Lee Shi Young, get back here.

461
00:31:32.674 --> 00:31:34.409
This isn't Seoul, you know.

462
00:31:34.409 --> 00:31:35.710
Get back here!

463
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.512
Why, that little...

464
00:31:37.512 --> 00:31:38.680
I'll go get her.

465
00:31:40.081 --> 00:31:41.349
Hey, Lee Shi Young!

466
00:31:41.349 --> 00:31:43.285
Stop right there.

467
00:31:45.787 --> 00:31:46.922
Hold it up.

468
00:31:50.759 --> 00:31:51.793
Hey.

469
00:31:58.466 --> 00:32:00.635
Wait up, seriously.

470
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:09.945
What is that?

471
00:32:09.945 --> 00:32:11.379
I know, right?

472
00:32:48.083 --> 00:32:49.217
Wow.

473
00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:52.253
Things like that still happen.

474
00:32:54.489 --> 00:32:55.991
You think you can live here?

475
00:32:56.591 --> 00:32:59.527
There was that girl pretending
to be a corpse and now this funeral.

476
00:32:59.527 --> 00:33:01.229
Doesn't it all feel wrong?

477
00:33:02.163 --> 00:33:03.164
So what if it is?

478
00:33:03.164 --> 00:33:04.532
Let's run away to Seoul.

479
00:33:04.532 --> 00:33:07.102
Where and how will you live?

480
00:33:07.102 --> 00:33:08.670
We can get part-time jobs.

481
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.139
You're friends with Myung Soo,
so stay at the internet cafe.

482
00:33:11.139 --> 00:33:12.874
I'll look into staying
at friend's house.

483
00:33:12.874 --> 00:33:15.677
I'm sure Mom will get a place
for us, at some point.

484
00:33:17.479 --> 00:33:20.482
Let's go back for now, make the tent,
and pretend to listen to Mom.

485
00:33:20.482 --> 00:33:22.617
We can hide our stuff
in Aunt Jung Soo's car.

486
00:33:22.617 --> 00:33:24.753
You want to go tonight? How?

487
00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:26.788
Are you going to sleep in that tent?

488
00:33:27.822 --> 00:33:28.857
No.

489
00:33:28.857 --> 00:33:31.226
I'll look for a way to leave. Come on.

490
00:34:10.398 --> 00:34:11.666
Hurry up and get out.

491
00:34:11.666 --> 00:34:14.936
We can't all sleep in there.
We're all going to sleep in here.

492
00:34:14.936 --> 00:34:16.604
Just sleep in the tent. Get out.

493
00:34:16.604 --> 00:34:18.873
Are you planning on doing
a tent protest to Grandma?

494
00:34:18.873 --> 00:34:20.775
Just come out. Come out and talk.

495
00:34:20.775 --> 00:34:22.877
Come out now. Come out.

496
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:29.384
Mother.

497
00:34:32.287 --> 00:34:35.256
Mother. Mother, please just listen.

498
00:34:35.256 --> 00:34:36.391
Mother!

499
00:34:37.926 --> 00:34:40.862
Mother, please hear me out. Mother.

500
00:34:40.862 --> 00:34:42.597
I know we showed up suddenly.

501
00:34:42.597 --> 00:34:44.566
Shi Kyung, I think you should go--

502
00:34:47.735 --> 00:34:49.404
Please...

503
00:34:49.404 --> 00:34:51.005
Mother.

504
00:34:54.542 --> 00:34:56.177
Where did they go?

505
00:35:01.282 --> 00:35:02.984
You're out this late at night?

506
00:35:02.984 --> 00:35:04.786
You're still here?

507
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.156
I'm supposed to meet Yong Gi's grandpa.

508
00:35:08.156 --> 00:35:10.692
Oh yeah. You must have visitors at home.

509
00:35:12.594 --> 00:35:14.229
How did you know that?

510
00:35:14.729 --> 00:35:17.832
I heard from Ga Ram.
He said he saw some kids.

511
00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:24.405
My daughter-in-law and
grandchildren came barging in.

512
00:35:24.405 --> 00:35:25.406
What?

513
00:35:25.406 --> 00:35:27.709
It's been a long time.

514
00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:29.811
You must happy to see them.

515
00:35:29.811 --> 00:35:33.515
The problem is that I'm
not happy to see them at all.

516
00:35:33.515 --> 00:35:38.553
- Why?
- Did they ever visit or call me?

517
00:35:38.553 --> 00:35:41.823
Did they ever send me anything
for the holidays?

518
00:35:41.823 --> 00:35:48.196
Since now they have nowhere to go,
they're barging in with all their stuff.

519
00:35:48.196 --> 00:35:52.033
Did they think I would come running out
with no shoes on and greet them?

520
00:35:52.867 --> 00:35:56.037
That's odd. I don't remember it that way.

521
00:35:57.438 --> 00:35:58.773
What do you mean?

522
00:35:58.773 --> 00:36:02.277
Even last year,
your daughter-in-law came with the kids.

523
00:36:02.277 --> 00:36:05.079
Who locked the doors and chased them off?

524
00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:06.681
Was it someone else?

525
00:36:06.681 --> 00:36:08.750
I never did that.

526
00:36:10.718 --> 00:36:13.254
When your daughter-in-law
called during the holidays

527
00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:14.923
you hung up telling her to be quiet.

528
00:36:15.957 --> 00:36:19.127
I saw it with my own eyes.
That wasn't you either?

529
00:36:21.396 --> 00:36:23.765
So, what did you do?

530
00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:25.066
Did you chase them away?

531
00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:30.138
Since when do you have so much
interest in the affairs of others?

532
00:36:30.138 --> 00:36:33.074
Others? You're not just another person.

533
00:36:33.074 --> 00:36:34.976
You're a hospice family member.

534
00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:37.912
That is correct.

535
00:36:37.912 --> 00:36:41.916
The hospice family is more
than enough for me.

536
00:36:41.916 --> 00:36:44.485
I don't care if they leave or stay.

537
00:36:44.485 --> 00:36:46.287
Tell them to do as they wish.

538
00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:50.258
Yong Gi's grandpa went
to the storage area.

539
00:37:02.937 --> 00:37:05.039
Stop that. You're going
to attract ghosts.

540
00:37:05.039 --> 00:37:07.609
Hey, this is pretty addictive.

541
00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:16.517
Hey, there are stars.

542
00:37:17.385 --> 00:37:19.954
Wow... wow.

543
00:37:19.954 --> 00:37:22.490
We are going to miss the last bus.

544
00:37:57.992 --> 00:37:59.694
They're not picking up.
What should we do?

545
00:37:59.694 --> 00:38:01.629
Shouldn't we report it to the police?

546
00:38:01.629 --> 00:38:03.698
- No, leave them be.
- Sis!

547
00:38:03.698 --> 00:38:05.566
They planned it and ran away.

548
00:38:05.566 --> 00:38:07.235
Leave them, and let them suffer.

549
00:38:07.235 --> 00:38:10.838
They don't know the roads,
and they don't have money.

550
00:38:10.838 --> 00:38:13.174
They'll come back
if they have nowhere to go.

551
00:38:13.174 --> 00:38:15.176
It's cold. Let's go in the tent.

552
00:38:17.045 --> 00:38:19.447
I'm seriously going crazy.

553
00:38:22.183 --> 00:38:24.585
I know it's cold,
but try to sleep a little.

554
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.022
It's okay. I'll stay up all night.

555
00:38:28.923 --> 00:38:29.957
All right, then.

556
00:38:31.659 --> 00:38:34.162
I don't think I could sleep anyway.

557
00:38:34.162 --> 00:38:37.498
You surprised me so many times today.

558
00:38:38.666 --> 00:38:41.769
It was a real mystery why you
told me to bring this tent.

559
00:38:41.769 --> 00:38:44.939
You knew how Grandma would react.

560
00:38:44.939 --> 00:38:48.343
When you know her, it's easy to predict.

561
00:38:48.343 --> 00:38:51.412
I thought you would be
a bit naive like me.

562
00:38:52.814 --> 00:38:54.882
You're surprisingly strong.

563
00:38:54.882 --> 00:38:57.318
Honestly, you're a bit shameless...

564
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.089
What about you? You followed me.
Aren't you shameless?

565
00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:04.258
I'm just including myself here
in case she lets you guys in.

566
00:39:05.326 --> 00:39:07.428
- Are you an extra bonus?
- Maybe not.

567
00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:09.931
Regardless, I'm not the main lead.

568
00:39:09.931 --> 00:39:11.933
But, you and Grandma
have lived like strangers.

569
00:39:11.933 --> 00:39:14.569
Now, you brought everything,
and you're coming at her like this.

570
00:39:15.136 --> 00:39:18.005
What can I do? This is my only option.

571
00:39:18.005 --> 00:39:20.274
I know I followed you here.

572
00:39:20.274 --> 00:39:24.345
But, I'm so scared of Grandma that
I feel like my heart's going to stop.

573
00:39:24.345 --> 00:39:26.848
You really are something.

574
00:39:26.848 --> 00:39:28.716
I'm really not.

575
00:39:28.716 --> 00:39:30.618
It's just my survival instinct.

576
00:39:31.519 --> 00:39:34.722
What are we going to do?
Are you leaving the kids like this?

577
00:39:34.722 --> 00:39:36.324
I can't do anything right now.

578
00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:40.728
I have to wait for Mother
to open the door.

579
00:39:40.728 --> 00:39:43.564
All I can do is wait
for the kids to come back.

580
00:39:43.564 --> 00:39:47.101
Will Grandma really open the door?

581
00:39:47.101 --> 00:39:48.202
I don't know.

582
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.372
After what happened
to the kid's father...

583
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.675
she detests me.

584
00:39:57.779 --> 00:40:00.181
She may never open the door.

585
00:40:00.948 --> 00:40:03.584
Then, what are we going to do?

586
00:40:04.385 --> 00:40:07.622
She wouldn't open the door for me.

587
00:40:07.622 --> 00:40:10.792
I thought she would
change her mind for the kids.

588
00:40:10.792 --> 00:40:13.761
<i>[Seoul]</i>
Mister, Mister, Mister!

589
00:40:16.063 --> 00:40:17.365
Mister, Mister!

590
00:40:18.399 --> 00:40:19.801
Hey, seriously?

591
00:40:19.801 --> 00:40:22.303
It's your fault we missed the last bus!

592
00:40:22.303 --> 00:40:24.005
- It's because you're ugly.
- What?

593
00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:25.573
- Put on makeup.
- Why don't you?

594
00:40:25.573 --> 00:40:27.642
- You ugly thing.
- Don't you look in the mirror?

595
00:40:27.642 --> 00:40:28.643
I don't have a mirror!

596
00:40:32.246 --> 00:40:34.315
Oh! Hold the sign up.

597
00:40:34.315 --> 00:40:35.349
Mister!

598
00:40:40.054 --> 00:40:42.156
Oh, they stopped.

599
00:40:42.156 --> 00:40:43.458
- Hey, hey.
- They stopped.

600
00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:45.193
That driver must be blind.

601
00:40:54.302 --> 00:40:55.336
Hi.

602
00:40:58.973 --> 00:41:00.107
This guy.

603
00:41:00.107 --> 00:41:02.143
Why is he making me run again?

604
00:41:02.143 --> 00:41:04.812
Lee Shi Kyung, where are you going?

605
00:41:04.812 --> 00:41:06.414
What's wrong?

606
00:41:07.515 --> 00:41:08.649
Gosh.

607
00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:14.055
What? What do you mean?

608
00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:15.323
Why would Shi Kyung do that?

609
00:41:15.957 --> 00:41:19.560
Your aunt and I will come there,
so don't go anywhere.

610
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.230
No, first, we have to call the police.

611
00:41:22.997 --> 00:41:25.433
Police? Did something happen
to Shi Kyung?

612
00:41:25.433 --> 00:41:27.602
Hurry and find the number
of the police station here.

613
00:41:27.602 --> 00:41:28.669
Police station number.

614
00:41:28.669 --> 00:41:30.171
Stop following me!

615
00:41:30.171 --> 00:41:32.540
- Stop running.
- You're dead.

616
00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.609
- What?
- Get him.

617
00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:37.345
- Why would you follow me here?
- Hey!

618
00:41:37.345 --> 00:41:38.946
Gosh.

619
00:41:47.355 --> 00:41:48.389
Hey.

620
00:41:59.233 --> 00:42:00.835
<i>Look, who are you people?</i>

621
00:42:00.835 --> 00:42:03.471
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

622
00:42:05.072 --> 00:42:06.474
He's gone.

623
00:42:06.474 --> 00:42:09.143
Oh, Honey!

624
00:42:11.379 --> 00:42:12.747
Let us pray.

625
00:42:12.747 --> 00:42:15.383
Kim Yi Ji, Susannah, who has
left us today...

626
00:42:15.383 --> 00:42:18.586
Honey!

627
00:42:35.236 --> 00:42:36.537
That punk is like a little rat.

628
00:42:38.005 --> 00:42:40.775
What are we doing
in the middle of nowhere?

629
00:42:40.775 --> 00:42:42.777
I think this is fun.

630
00:42:42.777 --> 00:42:44.912
Isn't it kind of cute how
he's playing hard to get?

631
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.881
Maybe not.

632
00:42:46.881 --> 00:42:48.416
Where is he though?

633
00:42:48.416 --> 00:42:51.452
I suppose it'll be fun once
we get to stomp on him.

634
00:42:59.594 --> 00:43:02.863
- Maybe he's here.
- I don't think so.

635
00:43:03.831 --> 00:43:06.300
I'm telling you, he's not here.

636
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.002
He is definitely in here.

637
00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:10.004
- He's not here.
- Why would he be here?

638
00:43:12.073 --> 00:43:13.841
I have a feeling he's in here.

639
00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.445
He's here.

640
00:43:17.445 --> 00:43:19.880
Hey, he isn't here.

641
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.582
Let's stop now and go.

642
00:43:21.582 --> 00:43:24.251
<i>Would he really be a witness
when we've scared him this much?</i>

643
00:43:24.251 --> 00:43:25.419
This guy...

644
00:43:29.657 --> 00:43:30.891
<i>Let's go.</i>

645
00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:33.227
Wait.

646
00:43:41.435 --> 00:43:43.938
No, no. You can't.

647
00:43:43.938 --> 00:43:45.439
Have a nice nap.

648
00:43:46.173 --> 00:43:47.642
Rest while you're in there.

649
00:43:47.642 --> 00:43:50.544
- No, no, no!
- You should've showered first.

650
00:43:50.544 --> 00:43:52.079
- Travel safe.
- Open up.

651
00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:53.547
No!

652
00:43:54.682 --> 00:43:56.250
No!

653
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:58.252
Hey, be quiet.

654
00:43:59.053 --> 00:44:03.190
I have a confession
to make. I like you.

655
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.426
Let's see each other again, okay?

656
00:44:05.426 --> 00:44:07.528
In the next life, okay?

657
00:44:08.429 --> 00:44:10.831
Open it. Open it. Open it!

658
00:44:10.831 --> 00:44:12.166
Please open it!

659
00:44:12.166 --> 00:44:14.902
- <i>Please open it.</i>
- Bye.

660
00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:17.104
Please save me!

661
00:44:18.372 --> 00:44:19.907
<i>Mom!</i>

662
00:44:22.443 --> 00:44:24.845
<i>Is anyone there? Anyone out there?</i>

663
00:44:24.845 --> 00:44:28.582
<i>You have to die and come back to life
several times to become an adult.</i>

664
00:44:28.582 --> 00:44:30.484
<i>I suddenly recalled Mom's words.</i>

665
00:44:31.285 --> 00:44:35.256
<i>Is this my first death?</i>

666
00:44:37.692 --> 00:44:40.394
Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom.

667
00:44:41.595 --> 00:44:44.165
Mom... Mom.

668
00:44:44.165 --> 00:44:47.001
Shi Kyung.
Why was he being chased?

669
00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:48.002
Did you call the police?

670
00:44:48.002 --> 00:44:50.671
- Did you see where they went?
- They ran that way.

671
00:44:51.539 --> 00:44:52.807
What's over that way?

672
00:44:52.807 --> 00:44:53.941
I don't know.

673
00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:00.347
You reported that someone
was being chased?

674
00:45:00.347 --> 00:45:01.682
Shi Kyung... Lee Shi Kyung.

675
00:45:01.682 --> 00:45:03.951
It was three people.
Three people followed him.

676
00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:08.022
Someone at the hospice said that
four male student intruders came in.

677
00:45:08.022 --> 00:45:10.224
- Let's go there.
- We'll be right behind you.

678
00:45:10.224 --> 00:45:12.359
Get in. Hurry up.

679
00:45:12.359 --> 00:45:13.861
Hospice?

680
00:45:16.163 --> 00:45:18.199
Why would students be here?

681
00:45:18.199 --> 00:45:20.601
We don't know.
This has never happened before.

682
00:45:20.601 --> 00:45:22.903
They didn't look like
they were from around here.

683
00:45:22.903 --> 00:45:24.872
Strange things keep happening.

684
00:45:24.872 --> 00:45:27.541
- Get a coffin ready.
- All right.

685
00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:30.077
Who needs the coffin today?

686
00:45:30.077 --> 00:45:33.080
It's a young man who
was in a motorcycle accident.

687
00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.216
He had no relatives either.

688
00:45:37.384 --> 00:45:41.422
I thought he ought to be sent off
in burial clothing, so I made him some.

689
00:45:41.422 --> 00:45:43.057
I see.

690
00:45:54.268 --> 00:45:56.704
Mother. What are you doing here?

691
00:45:56.704 --> 00:45:59.039
Did you follow me all the way here?

692
00:46:01.542 --> 00:46:04.145
<i>There's a person in the coffin!</i>

693
00:46:04.678 --> 00:46:06.113
What are you talking about?

694
00:46:06.113 --> 00:46:08.682
We are going to use
the coffin at the funeral.

695
00:46:11.886 --> 00:46:13.020
Is it a corpse?

696
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:17.792
I don't know. I have to open it.

697
00:46:25.232 --> 00:46:28.402
Lee Shi Kyung!
What are you doing in there?

698
00:46:30.504 --> 00:46:31.705
Shi Kyung.

699
00:46:32.573 --> 00:46:34.842
Is he alive?

700
00:46:36.377 --> 00:46:37.745
He is alive.

701
00:46:37.745 --> 00:46:39.613
Let's move him to the hospice ward.

702
00:46:39.613 --> 00:46:41.115
Lee Shi Kyung...

703
00:47:01.302 --> 00:47:02.403
Shi Kyung.

704
00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:04.505
Lee Shi Kyung, are you okay?

705
00:47:04.505 --> 00:47:06.273
Shi Kyung.

706
00:47:06.273 --> 00:47:07.408
Where...

707
00:47:10.811 --> 00:47:12.780
No!

708
00:47:13.214 --> 00:47:15.749
Open it. Please open it!

709
00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:20.821
Shi Kyung, what happened?

710
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:24.892
Those three boys did it, right?
We need to report this to the police.

711
00:47:24.892 --> 00:47:27.061
No! It's not like that.

712
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:28.529
What?

713
00:47:28.529 --> 00:47:31.465
It's a crime to trap
a person in a coffin.

714
00:47:31.465 --> 00:47:33.067
I told you it's not like that.

715
00:47:34.201 --> 00:47:36.570
I got into the coffin myself.

716
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:39.206
What do you mean?

717
00:47:39.206 --> 00:47:41.342
You couldn't have hammered
the nails in yourself.

718
00:47:41.342 --> 00:47:43.344
I fell asleep there.

719
00:47:44.345 --> 00:47:45.913
Someone must have done it by accident.

720
00:47:45.913 --> 00:47:47.381
Does that make sense?

721
00:47:47.381 --> 00:47:49.516
How could one not know you were in there?

722
00:47:49.516 --> 00:47:51.085
You climbed in there yourself?

723
00:47:51.085 --> 00:47:53.187
You got in that coffin yourself?

724
00:47:53.187 --> 00:47:54.822
Why did you do it?

725
00:47:55.556 --> 00:47:56.624
Just because...

726
00:47:57.992 --> 00:47:59.493
I didn't have a place to sleep.

727
00:47:59.493 --> 00:48:01.128
What?

728
00:48:01.128 --> 00:48:02.863
I didn't want to sleep in the tent.

729
00:48:02.863 --> 00:48:05.566
Because you don't like tents?
That doesn't make sense.

730
00:48:05.566 --> 00:48:07.101
Tell us the truth now.

731
00:48:07.101 --> 00:48:10.104
That is the truth.
I didn't want to sleep in the tent.

732
00:48:10.104 --> 00:48:11.672
There was nowhere to sleep.

733
00:48:11.672 --> 00:48:14.275
Shi Kyung is right about that.

734
00:48:20.748 --> 00:48:22.917
I can take him now, right?

735
00:48:22.917 --> 00:48:25.819
I'm sick. I'm really sick.

736
00:48:26.854 --> 00:48:29.423
He isn't injured anywhere.

737
00:48:29.423 --> 00:48:30.724
He can go.

738
00:48:30.724 --> 00:48:33.227
No, I really am sick.

739
00:48:33.227 --> 00:48:37.097
I have a lot of mental trauma
and feel panicky.

740
00:48:38.098 --> 00:48:41.669
I feel very dizzy, and
my arms and legs feel numb.

741
00:48:44.104 --> 00:48:45.139
Let's go.

742
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:57.451
Let's get as much in the yard as we can
before Mother changes her mind, okay?

743
00:48:57.451 --> 00:48:58.886
Do it properly.

744
00:48:59.853 --> 00:49:01.855
Sis, Sis.

745
00:49:16.103 --> 00:49:18.472
You two can share
the room on the inside.

746
00:49:19.239 --> 00:49:20.808
Keep this lump with you.

747
00:49:22.876 --> 00:49:25.312
Mother, thank you.

748
00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:28.482
You can share with me.

749
00:49:28.482 --> 00:49:29.750
I don't want to.

750
00:49:31.085 --> 00:49:33.687
Shi Kyung, you can use
that room over there.

751
00:49:33.687 --> 00:49:37.558
That room hasn't had the spirit
of a person in it for a long time.

752
00:49:37.558 --> 00:49:38.826
It will feel cold.

753
00:49:38.826 --> 00:49:42.529
I turned on the heat
and put blankets in there.

754
00:49:42.529 --> 00:49:44.832
Why does Shi Kyung get
his own room and I--

755
00:49:44.832 --> 00:49:48.035
Why do you refer to your older brother
by his name, Shi Kyung?

756
00:49:48.035 --> 00:49:50.537
So I call Shi Kyung, Shi Kyung.
What of it?

757
00:49:52.873 --> 00:49:56.310
They're in the same grade,
so I haven't been able to fix that.

758
00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:57.344
Sorry, Mother.

759
00:49:57.344 --> 00:50:01.682
Before your father left for college,
that was his room.

760
00:50:01.682 --> 00:50:04.518
He used it when he was about your age.

761
00:50:04.518 --> 00:50:07.321
He always had so many secrets.

762
00:50:08.956 --> 00:50:10.791
He used to lock it with a key.

763
00:50:10.791 --> 00:50:14.461
Now, you can use it.

764
00:50:17.097 --> 00:50:21.402
You will get sick if you suffer.
Just get some rest.

765
00:50:29.343 --> 00:50:33.080
I think we need to start getting
on Shi Kyung's good side.

766
00:51:04.645 --> 00:51:06.814
<i>This is what my dad looked like
when he was my age?</i>

767
00:51:24.465 --> 00:51:25.466
<i>Secrets?</i>

768
00:51:26.467 --> 00:51:27.568
<i>What were they?</i>

769
00:51:38.679 --> 00:51:41.181
<i>Strangely, I have no memories of my dad.</i>

770
00:51:53.961 --> 00:52:00.033
<i>That night, I had a dream of being lost
in a place I didn't recognize.</i>

771
00:52:09.776 --> 00:52:12.813
<i>Shi Kyung. Wake up, Shi Kyung.</i>

772
00:52:31.765 --> 00:52:34.735
<i>[I knew if I stayed around long enough,
something like this would happen.]</i>

773
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:36.703
<i>Lee Shi Kyung, you need to go to school.</i>

774
00:52:39.139 --> 00:52:40.174
School?

775
00:52:43.944 --> 00:52:45.479
What school?

776
00:52:51.385 --> 00:52:52.486
You want us to use these?

777
00:52:52.486 --> 00:52:55.989
Mom, who uses these nowadays?

778
00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.192
Give it back then.

779
00:53:01.528 --> 00:53:04.264
Hey, where are you going?
You don't know the way there.

780
00:53:04.264 --> 00:53:06.133
Hey, Lee Shi Kyung.

781
00:53:06.133 --> 00:53:08.402
You're banned from games
and forbidden to stay out late.

782
00:53:08.402 --> 00:53:09.436
Mom!

783
00:53:10.237 --> 00:53:13.106
Also, who were those
three boys last night?

784
00:53:13.106 --> 00:53:15.642
Was it about you being a witness?

785
00:53:15.642 --> 00:53:17.211
No.

786
00:53:18.412 --> 00:53:20.414
It's nothing, so don't worry, Mom.

787
00:53:20.414 --> 00:53:21.782
I said it's not.

788
00:53:21.782 --> 00:53:23.951
You have to not worry me so much.

789
00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:25.550
That's true.

790
00:53:25.552 --> 00:53:28.622
- You're killing me.
- Ouch, ouch.

791
00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:32.159
Mom! I was a patient
in the hospital yesterday.

792
00:53:32.159 --> 00:53:36.863
Don't even think about trying
to slide by like you did in Seoul.

793
00:53:38.165 --> 00:53:41.768
Still, this isn't right.
I suffered a lot yesterday.

794
00:53:41.768 --> 00:53:44.204
Ow... ow, ow.

795
00:53:45.672 --> 00:53:48.375
Mom, I think I need a CT scan.

796
00:53:49.209 --> 00:53:50.644
Hurry up and follow Shi Young.

797
00:53:51.545 --> 00:53:54.248
Jung Soo, what are you doing?
We need to head out.

798
00:53:54.915 --> 00:53:56.783
I'm in pain.

799
00:54:06.994 --> 00:54:08.962
<i>Whether it's Seoul or here...</i>

800

<i>all the girls in Korea
look the same from behind.</i>

801
00:54:14.301 --> 00:54:17.504
<i>Long hair, school uniform,
and short skirts.</i>

802
00:54:18.372 --> 00:54:21.642
<i>They even look similar
from the side and the front.</i>

803
00:54:21.642 --> 00:54:25.212
<i>They're either looking at their phones,
taking selfies, or gossiping.</i>

804
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:52.272
<i>Ah, it's the corpse girl.</i>

805
00:54:57.377 --> 00:55:00.914
<i>There is a girl in Korea who is
different than all the others.</i>

I'm a transfer student.</i>

812
00:55:35.916 --> 00:55:38.218
<i>I won't say fake things like,
"Let's all get along."</i>

813
00:55:38.218 --> 00:55:40.687
<i>This is a place of death.</i>

814
00:55:40.687 --> 00:55:41.722
<i>Excuse me?</i>

815
00:55:41.722 --> 00:55:44.858
<i>Think about someone you long to see.</i>

816
00:55:45.992 --> 00:55:50.230
<i>"You don't have much time left,
and you foolishly use it to avoid me."</i>

817
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:51.698
<i>"Marry me."</i>

818
00:55:51.698 --> 00:55:54.668
<i>What will you have inscribed
on your tombstone when you die?</i>

819
00:55:54.668 --> 00:55:56.503
<i>Hey, Lee Shi Kyung.</i>

820
00:55:58.939 --> 00:56:02.642
<i>So, you guys lie in coffins and
think about your tombstone inscriptions.</i>

821
00:56:02.642 --> 00:56:03.810
<i>How are you any different?</i>
