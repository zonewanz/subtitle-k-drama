3
00:00:07.058 --> 00:00:08.129
Mom.

4
00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:11.259
Why did you call her Ji An, Mom?

5
00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:12.798
This is me.

6
00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:18.898
Why did you tell Hae Ja this is Ji An?

7
00:00:19.698 --> 00:00:21.069
Isn't this me?

8
00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:25.179
It is you.

9
00:00:26.078 --> 00:00:28.808
This is me, right?

10
00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.518
Then why did you say it's Ji An?

11
00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:35.319
I...

12
00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.989
switched you and Ji An.

13
00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:42.989
What... What did you say?

14
00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:46.158
I'm sorry, Ji Soo.

15
00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:48.398
I sent Ji An...

16
00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:52.499
instead of you.

17
00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.269
I did so because of my greed.

18
00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.538
It wasn't Ji An.

19
00:01:00.338 --> 00:01:01.349
It was you.

20
00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:11.373
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

21
00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:18.299
When did I say it was Ji An?

22
00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:21.969
I never said that. You heard it wrong.

23
00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:25.498
No. She said it's Ji An.

24
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:28.168
Hae Ja's mistaken.

25
00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:31.409
I just didn't say anything because she rushed in.

26
00:01:31.478 --> 00:01:33.439
Then why were you crying looking at my picture?

27
00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.549
- What? - I heard you crying.

28
00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.618
I came back to get my cell phone...

29
00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:41.288
before Hae Ja was here.

30
00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:43.549
You kept crying.

31
00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:47.058
That's...

32
00:01:48.288 --> 00:01:50.728
I wasn't crying...

33
00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.429
looking at your picture.

34
00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:55.799
Sometimes,

35
00:01:56.368 --> 00:01:59.868
I just feel like crying.

36
00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:02.808
At my age, people cry...

37
00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.439
even by watching leaves fall in the rain.

38
00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:09.079
I'm in menopause.

39
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.148
Liar.

40
00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.248
You cried because you miss Ji An.

41
00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.459
Did you cry...

42
00:02:23.158 --> 00:02:25.158
in secret every day?

43
00:02:27.058 --> 00:02:29.098
Don't be upset.

44
00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:33.699
She's doing better in a rich family.

45
00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:36.509
You saw how well she's doing last time.

46
00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.239
You're right.

47
00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.248
Did you cry because...

48
00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.019
I missed Ji An so much?

49
00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.019
Is that why you cried looking at my picture?

50
00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:53.519
You said...

51
00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.759
you should be at work before customers arrive.

52
00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.098
You're right.

53
00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.028
I couldn't leave because you were crying so much.

54
00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.098
Then is this left-handed girl my dead sister?

55
00:03:05.098 --> 00:03:07.269
Is she the real Ji An? And is this me?

56
00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:10.368
You're late. Hurry up.

57
00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:14.079
- I have to leave too. Go. - Okay.

58
00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:15.778
See you later.

59
00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:35.068
Eun Seok.

60
00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:36.628
Yes.

61
00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:38.368
What are your plans for today?

62
00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.868
I have an English speaking lesson at 10...

63
00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.908
But I can speak English.

64
00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.378
It's phonics.

65
00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:53.679
You didn't learn English from abroad.

66
00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:55.389
You need to fix your pronunciation.

67
00:03:55.748 --> 00:03:57.318
I see.

68
00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.789
I have a manners lesson from 2pm to 4pm.

69
00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.429
Then have dinner outside with me tonight.

70
00:04:05.898 --> 00:04:07.199
You should wait...

71
00:04:07.568 --> 00:04:10.528
until Father comes back.

72
00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:13.299
I'll tell Mr. Yang...

73
00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.568
to train her until the evening.

74
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.638
What for? She's already studying all day.

75
00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:20.849
It's not good manners to do her own stuff...

76
00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.748
while answering an adult's question...

77
00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:25.518
just like she did now.

78
00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.219
Father's returning soon.

79
00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:29.489
I can't let him see her being rude like this.

80
00:04:30.248 --> 00:04:33.419
It's not easy to change her habits by studying.

81
00:04:34.258 --> 00:04:35.628
She still has enough time.

82
00:04:36.058 --> 00:04:38.099
It's not enough to get rid of the bad habits...

83
00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:39.558
she had for 25 years.

84
00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:48.839
You'll be working as a regular employee...

85
00:04:49.068 --> 00:04:50.938
at Haesung Apparel's Marketing Team.

86
00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:53.339
Haesung Apparel?

87
00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:56.649
Honey, we agreed to ask about her opinion first.

88
00:04:56.708 --> 00:04:58.479
The chairman confirmed it.

89
00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.018
I heard you always wanted to be a regular employee.

90
00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:08.929
Yes.

91
00:05:09.328 --> 00:05:12.399
Why do you want her in the Marketing Team?

92
00:05:12.498 --> 00:05:15.299
We've already registered our DNA.

93
00:05:16.068 --> 00:05:17.498
Your parents recently told you...

94
00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.039
the secret behind your birth,

95
00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.578
so you registered your DNA yourself...

96
00:05:24.578 --> 00:05:26.039
to find your real parents.

97
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.049
We found each other in December.

98
00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.849
That's why we will reveal you to the public...

99
00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.388
at our company's 40th anniversary.

100
00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:37.489
Before we do that,

101
00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:40.489
don't you think it'd be better if you were...

102
00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:42.429
working at the Marketing Team of our company?

103
00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.498
I don't think I understand what you mean by that.

104
00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.469
We wanted to introduce you as soon as we found you.

105
00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.169
But if that happens,

106
00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.539
the public and the press will gossip about us.

107
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:57.839
That includes you and our company.

108
00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.049
Until then, you must become...

109
00:06:02.878 --> 00:06:06.049
someone that everyone recognizes as one of us.

110
00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:08.419
But...

111
00:06:08.948 --> 00:06:10.789
I was already fired from your company.

112
00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:13.318
Will I be employed by special employment?

113
00:06:13.758 --> 00:06:16.289
Is that why you separated the Marketing Team?

114
00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:18.258
It was your Strategic Planning Team...

115
00:06:18.258 --> 00:06:19.958
which suggested separating the Marketing Team.

116
00:06:20.698 --> 00:06:21.799
We only...

117
00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:24.169
made the decision now.

118
00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:33.308
- Seo Hyun. - What are you doing?

119
00:06:33.638 --> 00:06:35.409
Oh, did I startle you?

120
00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:37.008
How couldn't I be?

121
00:06:37.578 --> 00:06:39.549
Why did you knock if you were going to open it?

122
00:06:39.578 --> 00:06:40.649
What?

123
00:06:41.448 --> 00:06:42.518
Eun Seok.

124
00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.958
You knock as a way of asking if you can come in.

125
00:06:46.388 --> 00:06:49.558
Even Mom and Dad don't come in unless I respond.

126
00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:52.998
I see. I'm sorry.

127
00:06:53.558 --> 00:06:55.328
It's okay. It's your first time.

128
00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:56.828
What is this about?

129
00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:59.339
Well,

130
00:07:00.438 --> 00:07:04.708
I just wanted to get back the necklace I gave you.

131
00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:08.208
It was you who gave it to me to begin with.

132
00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:09.409
You said that it wasn't your taste...

133
00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:10.979
and that it looked better on me.

134
00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:13.279
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:16.589
It is true that it looks better on you.

136
00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:19.489
But I've been thinking that it was a mistake.

137
00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:21.359
It was a meaningful gift,

138
00:07:21.359 --> 00:07:23.659
but it wasn't polite of me to give it away.

139
00:07:23.888 --> 00:07:25.128
Hold on.

140
00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:32.239
Here.

141
00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:35.068
Thank you. And I'm sorry.

142
00:07:35.068 --> 00:07:37.169
Okay. I need to go to school,

143
00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:38.378
so I should change now.

144
00:07:38.378 --> 00:07:40.438
Sure, sure.

145
00:07:45.878 --> 00:07:47.049
Unbelievable.

146
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:49.419
Why is she pestering me?

147
00:08:21.748 --> 00:08:23.948
- Please enjoy. - Have a good day.

148
00:08:24.688 --> 00:08:26.758
- Ji Soo. - Yes?

149
00:08:26.758 --> 00:08:27.989
I can manage on my own.

150
00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:29.289
Go, and do your delivery.

151
00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:31.799
Since yesterday was the first day,

152
00:08:31.799 --> 00:08:34.328
I'll go and see how much of them were sold first.

153
00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:36.429
Okay. That's a good idea.

154
00:08:37.129 --> 00:08:39.369
You want to see the bicycle guy twice.

155
00:08:40.238 --> 00:08:42.738
It's only until I find out when he comes to the cafe.

156
00:08:43.869 --> 00:08:45.238
I'll be back.

157
00:08:52.218 --> 00:08:54.789
She would have called back if she saw the check.

158
00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:05.328
Nice... Nice to see you.

159
00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:07.029
Hi.

160
00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:11.769
I came to see how much of the bread...

161
00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:13.369
was sold yesterday.

162
00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:17.438
What do you mean?

163
00:09:18.409 --> 00:09:21.879
Our bakery supplies our baked goods to this cafe.

164
00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:23.379
We started yesterday.

165
00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:29.249
It was all sold out.

166
00:09:29.948 --> 00:09:31.619
Oh, I see.

167
00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:34.558
Then I'll hurry back and bring the bread for you.

168
00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.159
I'll be back soon.

169
00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:41.468
We're making good use of the chairs.

170
00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:48.738
- Hee. - It's... It's only...

171
00:09:48.738 --> 00:09:50.779
because their baked goods are delicious. Really.

172
00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:53.108
And the customers asked for something to eat too.

173
00:09:53.108 --> 00:09:54.348
But still.

174
00:09:57.419 --> 00:09:58.419
By the way,

175
00:09:58.919 --> 00:10:01.188
how much did she pay for the chairs?

176
00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:02.948
1,000 dollars.

177
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:04.619
Didn't I tell you?

178
00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:06.619
1,000 dollars?

179
00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:10.698
Mr. Kang, I'll be back.

180
00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:20.968
I have a question for you.

181
00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:23.039
For me?

182
00:10:23.608 --> 00:10:26.578
You bought those chairs to use them here, right?

183
00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:28.409
Yes.

184
00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:31.049
The elders visit our bakery sometimes.

185
00:10:31.318 --> 00:10:34.119
The bakery's owner must've paid for them, right?

186
00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:35.688
Yes.

187
00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:38.058
Hello.

188
00:10:38.358 --> 00:10:40.119
Did you give her 1,000 dollars?

189
00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:42.429
- What? 1,000 dollars? - Wait.

190
00:10:42.429 --> 00:10:43.889
Well, that was...

191
00:10:43.889 --> 00:10:47.029
If you don't mind, may I ask how much you gave her?

192
00:10:50.568 --> 00:10:51.899
I gave her 100 dollars.

193
00:10:54.468 --> 00:10:55.468
I understand.

194
00:10:57.978 --> 00:10:58.978
What should I do?

195
00:11:02.049 --> 00:11:03.049
Here is 900 dollars.

196
00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:05.279
I was told that I was to decide the price.

197
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:07.078
So... That's why I decided to pay that much.

198
00:11:07.078 --> 00:11:08.649
You were just running an errand.

199
00:11:14.188 --> 00:11:15.789
I'll take these.

200
00:11:16.858 --> 00:11:18.029
Goodbye.

201
00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:21.899
Hey.

202
00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:23.828
Goodness.

203
00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:27.769
But you did manage to see him twice though.

204
00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:30.669
He's angry, isn't he?

205
00:11:32.708 --> 00:11:33.879
Hey, you...

206
00:11:40.318 --> 00:11:42.019
You're still here.

207
00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:43.848
I figured you had something to tell me.

208
00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:46.218
How did you know?

209
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:47.389
You've been...

210
00:11:47.828 --> 00:11:49.828
wanting to talk to me before too, right?

211
00:11:50.328 --> 00:11:51.328
Sorry?

212
00:11:59.098 --> 00:12:01.838
- Yes. I... - Don't say it.

213
00:12:03.108 --> 00:12:05.179
- Pardon me? - Let's keep it that way.

214
00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:07.848
I don't want you to tell me anything.

215
00:12:07.848 --> 00:12:08.879
I...

216
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:11.049
like someone else.

217
00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:13.948
Please.

218
00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:32.769
Right. He likes someone else.

219
00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:37.738
It must be that girl back then.

220
00:12:49.149 --> 00:12:50.448
How many days do you want?

221
00:12:51.588 --> 00:12:52.718
Sorry?

222
00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:54.389
Don't you need to cry for a few days?

223
00:12:55.188 --> 00:12:57.058
Women crying is what I hate the most.

224
00:12:57.259 --> 00:12:58.558
So take a few days off.

225
00:13:00.198 --> 00:13:01.499
I won't cry.

226
00:13:02.468 --> 00:13:04.299
I already knew this would happen.

227
00:13:05.669 --> 00:13:08.238
I gave him my number, but he never called back.

228
00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:11.139
And I already knew...

229
00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:12.879
that he likes someone else.

230
00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.818
But how did he know I was going to confess my love?

231
00:13:22.688 --> 00:13:25.019
Mom, Eun Seok isn't ready yet.

232
00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:26.818
I think it'd be better...

233
00:13:26.818 --> 00:13:28.828
if you delayed bringing her into the company.

234
00:13:28.929 --> 00:13:31.529
If she is too prepared, she might stand out.

235
00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.659
Other employees will remember her...

236
00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:35.529
from when she had the contract job.

237
00:13:37.228 --> 00:13:39.169
I didn't think that far.

238
00:13:42.608 --> 00:13:44.179
She's bright and intelligent.

239
00:13:44.179 --> 00:13:45.578
(Resume)

240
00:13:46.808 --> 00:13:48.749
Her grades are good.

241
00:13:48.749 --> 00:13:50.978
And her evaluation from the Marketing Team is too.

242
00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:54.789
She should've been given the permenant position.

243
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.289
I can see that she did everything she could.

244
00:13:58.988 --> 00:14:00.588
But Do Kyung,

245
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:03.029
you are being a little harsh on Eun Seok.

246
00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:04.328
What is going on?

247
00:14:05.698 --> 00:14:07.529
She needs to be straightened out a bit.

248
00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:10.738
(General Manager Min)

249
00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:15.208
What is it?

250
00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:18.039
Eun Seok wants to go out?

251
00:14:21.708 --> 00:14:24.919
Eun Seok wants to go out for an hour.

252
00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.179
Let her, and test her.

253
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:30.988
I'm sorry, but I'd like to get a refund for this.

254
00:14:36.228 --> 00:14:38.698
May I ask why you want to get a refund?

255
00:14:40.029 --> 00:14:41.698
Please just refund this for me.

256
00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:52.838
Ji Tae, you said you'd never get married.

257
00:14:52.838 --> 00:14:54.308
I'll never get married!

258
00:14:54.308 --> 00:14:55.708
I don't want to get married.

259
00:14:55.909 --> 00:14:57.718
You told me to go on a blind date.

260
00:14:58.119 --> 00:15:00.549
You told me to see someone else whenever I wanted.

261
00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:02.919
I'm the oldest son of a poor family.

262
00:15:03.948 --> 00:15:05.688
I'm hopeless, so I'll never get married.

263
00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:08.789
I just can't...

264
00:15:09.728 --> 00:15:12.328
pass down my poverty to my own children.

265
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:14.228
So I won't get married.

266
00:15:14.769 --> 00:15:17.198
I can't even afford the apartment you want.

267
00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:19.139
So I won't get married.

268
00:15:19.438 --> 00:15:20.838
I won't ever!

269
00:15:44.499 --> 00:15:45.499
Tae Soo!

270
00:15:48.869 --> 00:15:50.738
- Thank you. - Thanks for coming.

271
00:15:53.468 --> 00:15:54.608
Aren't you going to have lunch?

272
00:15:54.608 --> 00:15:56.568
Of course I am. I am working so I can eat.

273
00:15:57.108 --> 00:15:58.478
I'll have spicy nakji bokkeum.

274
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:02.978
Aren't online lessons too expensive for our budget?

275
00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:06.578
We grew up taking lessons on TV, but time's changed.

276
00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:09.688
- What's for lunch? - Wait. I'm almost done.

277
00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:11.488
(Sending)

278
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:13.088
Do I get to choose?

279
00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:14.759
Are you craving for anything in particular?

280
00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:18.499
I want something spicy enough to burn my stomach.

281
00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:36.379
What's wrong? Did you fight with Ji Tae?

282
00:16:36.448 --> 00:16:37.478
What do you mean?

283
00:16:37.478 --> 00:16:40.379
It seems like you two are angry at each other.

284
00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:43.019
Let's go eat kkomjangeo instead of nakji bokkeum.

285
00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:44.019
Sure.

286
00:16:47.728 --> 00:16:49.828
Fortunately, your bones are fine.

287
00:16:49.828 --> 00:16:53.098
But don't lift anything heavy for two weeks.

288
00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:54.769
Two weeks?

289
00:16:54.968 --> 00:16:57.098
Yes. Considering your age,

290
00:16:57.098 --> 00:16:59.338
it's better to rest for a longer period.

291
00:17:02.938 --> 00:17:04.578
I can take out the garbage...

292
00:17:04.578 --> 00:17:07.309
and assist the carpenter.

293
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:08.778
I can lift lighter loads.

294
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:09.978
No, you can't.

295
00:17:09.978 --> 00:17:12.379
If you get hurt again, you won't be able to work.

296
00:17:12.379 --> 00:17:13.518
Mr. Kang,

297
00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.518
I am not doing this for money.

298
00:17:15.518 --> 00:17:17.419
You can pay me half.

299
00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.518
You must be avoiding your wife after fighting.

300
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.458
Why don't you just reconcile with her?

301
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.528
I have to finish what I have started.

302
00:17:25.528 --> 00:17:27.569
You should just go home and rest.

303
00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.768
I will call you again when our next project begins.

304
00:17:37.379 --> 00:17:39.879
A hamburger steak is usually served on a plate.

305
00:17:39.978 --> 00:17:43.309
But our hamburger steak is served in a clay pot.

306
00:17:43.309 --> 00:17:46.649
But it is quite heavy.

307
00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.919
Why do you insist serving it in a clay pot?

308
00:17:49.619 --> 00:17:50.919
First of all,

309
00:17:50.919 --> 00:17:52.819
clay pots keep the food warm...

310
00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:54.559
until the customers finish the food.

311
00:17:54.788 --> 00:17:56.758
And since it's a traditional earthenware,

312
00:17:56.758 --> 00:17:59.528
it adds sentimental values to the dish as well.

313
00:18:00.028 --> 00:18:01.298
I see.

314
00:18:14.309 --> 00:18:15.579
Honey.

315
00:18:17.048 --> 00:18:18.048
Hey.

316
00:18:19.319 --> 00:18:20.379
Well...

317
00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:23.188
Did you quit work?

318
00:18:25.288 --> 00:18:26.288
Give that to me.

319
00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.859
What's wrong? Did you get hurt?

320
00:18:32.198 --> 00:18:34.069
No, it's nothing.

321
00:18:34.728 --> 00:18:37.228
It's not nothing. You even got a cast.

322
00:18:37.738 --> 00:18:40.399
How bad is it? How did you get hurt?

323
00:18:41.339 --> 00:18:42.508
What do you have there?

324
00:18:45.008 --> 00:18:46.109
(Gyeongseong Hambagu)

325
00:18:46.409 --> 00:18:47.748
What is it?

326
00:18:48.478 --> 00:18:49.748
You know what it is.

327
00:18:50.679 --> 00:18:52.379
I went to the training of the franchise...

328
00:18:53.849 --> 00:18:55.589
Haesung Corporation is opening for us.

329
00:19:03.329 --> 00:19:05.198
Are you out of your mind?

330
00:19:08.968 --> 00:19:11.139
You never told me not to do it.

331
00:19:11.139 --> 00:19:13.669
I left the contract wide-open on the table.

332
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:15.109
Didn't you know what that meant?

333
00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:17.339
Did you think that would stop me?

334
00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:19.679
Yes. I thought that would stop you.

335
00:19:20.079 --> 00:19:22.248
How can you accept it? Do you have no shame?

336
00:19:23.278 --> 00:19:24.649
This is why I accepted it.

337
00:19:24.649 --> 00:19:27.218
I didn't know when you'd become like this.

338
00:19:27.649 --> 00:19:28.649
What?

339
00:19:28.849 --> 00:19:31.718
How can we live off your daily wage?

340
00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:36.458
Living with 1,500 dollars a month was hard enough.

341
00:19:38.629 --> 00:19:40.298
I know how you feel,

342
00:19:41.228 --> 00:19:43.829
but this is not for me. It's for our children.

343
00:19:43.829 --> 00:19:45.468
Don't use our children as excuses.

344
00:19:45.798 --> 00:19:48.909
Aren't you ashamed to use that for our children?

345
00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:53.179
Go cancel the contract.

346
00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:55.649
I will earn more money.

347
00:19:56.379 --> 00:19:59.018
Why haven't you done that all along?

348
00:20:01.048 --> 00:20:03.248
No matter what you say,

349
00:20:03.448 --> 00:20:05.059
I am going to run this restaurant.

350
00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:09.059
Ji Soo. Yes. Our dear Ji Soo.

351
00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:11.798
If it weren't for us, she would've died there.

352
00:20:12.399 --> 00:20:14.329
Don't you remember?

353
00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:16.498
We did raise her after all.

354
00:20:16.768 --> 00:20:19.698
I will just consider it as a payment for that.

355
00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:21.109
Honey.

356
00:20:21.369 --> 00:20:22.869
I am going to do well...

357
00:20:22.869 --> 00:20:25.809
and send her abroad to study baking.

358
00:20:26.438 --> 00:20:28.478
Stop being ridiculous. Please, honey.

359
00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.548
Please stop. You must cancel the contract.

360
00:20:30.778 --> 00:20:32.349
I will work harder.

361
00:20:32.349 --> 00:20:36.048
How can you work harder? What can you do?

362
00:20:36.089 --> 00:20:37.688
You are too old for that.

363
00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:40.958
Let's run this together,

364
00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:43.159
marry off Ji Tae,

365
00:20:43.389 --> 00:20:44.528
and Ji Ho...

366
00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:48.998
Do you know how hard Ji Ho studies?

367
00:20:50.738 --> 00:20:52.169
Thank you, my dear friend.

368
00:20:52.899 --> 00:20:54.109
Good job.

369
00:20:54.208 --> 00:20:55.369
Don't forget.

370
00:20:55.369 --> 00:20:57.639
If you move out, you're going to treat me.

371
00:20:58.179 --> 00:21:00.208
If I succeed to move out, I will treat you.

372
00:21:01.248 --> 00:21:04.778
If my business succeeds, I will treat you for life.

373
00:21:05.819 --> 00:21:09.488
Move out before making any promises.

374
00:21:11.589 --> 00:21:13.359
- I'm leaving now. - Bye.

375
00:21:15.988 --> 00:21:17.188
What is that?

376
00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:20.528
- It's a foreshadow. - A foreshadow?

377
00:21:20.528 --> 00:21:23.899
Everything needs a sign.

378
00:21:23.899 --> 00:21:25.238
(Report Card)

379
00:21:25.738 --> 00:21:30.309
This is the key that will get me stand on my own.

380
00:21:33.179 --> 00:21:34.909
Seriously. Come to your senses, boy.

381
00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:37.948
What will you do if Ji Ho goes...

382
00:21:37.948 --> 00:21:39.849
- to college next year? - Nice.

383
00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:42.788
Do you have money...

384
00:21:43.419 --> 00:21:45.359
to pay for Ji Ho's college tuition?

385
00:21:46.319 --> 00:21:49.528
- I do. - For four years?

386
00:21:51.498 --> 00:21:54.599
Do you want Ji Ho to work and study like Ji An?

387
00:21:54.599 --> 00:21:56.669
Or will you ask for money from Ji Tae again?

388
00:22:00.968 --> 00:22:02.139
I'm home.

389
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:05.708
How did you get here, Dad?

390
00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:08.508
Ji Tae, you're home.

391
00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:12.548
What happened to your hand?

392
00:22:13.448 --> 00:22:16.048
He got hurt.

393
00:22:17.018 --> 00:22:19.018
So he quit his job.

394
00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:22.829
You quit your job?

395
00:22:25.399 --> 00:22:28.569
No. I am going back soon.

396
00:22:28.899 --> 00:22:31.998
I won't die out like this.

397
00:22:31.998 --> 00:22:34.609
Don't you worry. I got everything planned.

398
00:22:36.069 --> 00:22:37.879
- Okay. Get some rest. - Okay.

399
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:40.478
The kids don't know about this yet.

400
00:22:49.548 --> 00:22:51.988
I left some documents at the office.

401
00:22:52.218 --> 00:22:54.028
I need to finish it by tonight.

402
00:22:54.188 --> 00:22:55.929
Okay. Go then.

403
00:23:09.938 --> 00:23:12.339
(Ji Tae)

404
00:23:20.478 --> 00:23:21.488
Hello?

405
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:25.659
I'm outside your house. Would you come out?

406
00:23:29.228 --> 00:23:31.859
Please bring out my suit if you haven't tossed it.

407
00:23:33.629 --> 00:23:34.728
Okay.

408
00:23:47.179 --> 00:23:49.679
Have a seat. Don't be old-fashioned.

409
00:24:06.129 --> 00:24:07.599
It's cold outside today.

410
00:24:10.569 --> 00:24:11.599
Thanks.

411
00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:18.538
I am sorry about the other day.

412
00:24:20.038 --> 00:24:21.448
I was thoughtless.

413
00:24:23.048 --> 00:24:24.679
I should've waited...

414
00:24:25.879 --> 00:24:27.119
until you parted with that guy.

415
00:24:28.819 --> 00:24:30.018
Why didn't you?

416
00:24:31.688 --> 00:24:33.159
I was too hungry.

417
00:24:36.889 --> 00:24:38.458
I am sorry about going on a blind date...

418
00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:42.169
- without a notice. - Sorry I embarrassed you.

419
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:45.268
It was fine. He wasn't my type.

420
00:24:45.268 --> 00:24:47.238
And yet, you went to get more drinks.

421
00:24:47.238 --> 00:24:49.139
- You never know. - Let's break up.

422
00:24:51.738 --> 00:24:53.309
Didn't we break up that day?

423
00:24:56.179 --> 00:24:57.278
Lee Soo A.

424
00:24:58.048 --> 00:25:00.179
We can't break up fighting after four years, can we?

425
00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:02.349
We should break up with a smile.

426
00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:04.589
We talked about this.

427
00:25:05.018 --> 00:25:07.528
We are supposed to wish each other good luck.

428
00:25:09.859 --> 00:25:10.899
Right.

429
00:25:12.258 --> 00:25:13.399
You're right.

430
00:25:22.008 --> 00:25:23.438
I hope you meet a good man.

431
00:25:25.109 --> 00:25:26.438
Don't date a man like that guy the other day.

432
00:25:27.948 --> 00:25:29.748
His smile looks like he's a playboy.

433
00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:33.718
Is he rich enough?

434
00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:39.958
I heard he has a three-bedroom apartment.

435
00:25:43.129 --> 00:25:44.698
What does he do?

436
00:25:45.458 --> 00:25:46.528
He's an accountant.

437
00:25:47.228 --> 00:25:49.998
Gosh. I feel even more sorry.

438
00:25:54.538 --> 00:25:55.609
Stay healthy.

439
00:25:57.008 --> 00:25:59.379
You won't get married anyway,

440
00:26:00.238 --> 00:26:02.609
so I won't tell you to meet a good woman.

441
00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:04.819
This is all I got to say.

442
00:26:08.089 --> 00:26:09.349
It's been a pleasure being with you.

443
00:26:13.218 --> 00:26:14.228
Me too.

444
00:26:18.399 --> 00:26:19.528
Take care.

445
00:26:23.069 --> 00:26:24.099
You too.

446
00:26:53.758 --> 00:26:57.839
(Dormitory)

447
00:26:59.998 --> 00:27:01.208
Great.

448
00:27:02.268 --> 00:27:03.538
You're home, Ji Tae.

449
00:27:09.748 --> 00:27:11.718
Why are you going to bed with your clothes on?

450
00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:14.948
Why do you have another suit?

451
00:27:47.849 --> 00:27:48.988
Dad.

452
00:27:49.048 --> 00:27:51.059
Gosh, Ji Soo.

453
00:27:51.859 --> 00:27:53.589
What is this? Are you crying?

454
00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:54.758
Is something wrong?

455
00:27:56.228 --> 00:27:57.899
I am just happy.

456
00:27:58.829 --> 00:28:01.698
I am just happy to see you.

457
00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:23.349
(Refund receipt)

458
00:28:23.548 --> 00:28:26.919
I returned the gifts for my other family.

459
00:28:29.159 --> 00:28:31.429
Didn't you give it to them?

460
00:28:33.028 --> 00:28:34.329
They refused.

461
00:28:35.468 --> 00:28:37.998
I didn't tell you about it...

462
00:28:37.998 --> 00:28:39.698
because I was planning to take it back to them.

463
00:28:40.498 --> 00:28:42.109
But I was thoughtless.

464
00:28:42.938 --> 00:28:45.478
I am sorry to have caused trouble...

465
00:28:46.038 --> 00:28:48.248
for both my previous and my current parents.

466
00:28:53.579 --> 00:28:55.619
Yes. I gave you that money...

467
00:28:56.018 --> 00:28:58.559
to spend it in a day, but you couldn't.

468
00:28:59.218 --> 00:29:00.359
So I will take it back.

469
00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:06.528
You won't be leaving home for a while,

470
00:29:06.528 --> 00:29:08.369
and you will be with the driver if you need to.

471
00:29:09.069 --> 00:29:10.768
Keep this for any emergencies.

472
00:29:13.038 --> 00:29:14.309
I will do as you say.

473
00:29:28.218 --> 00:29:29.919
Why are you listening to music at home?

474
00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:31.619
You used to hate listening to music at home.

475
00:29:32.188 --> 00:29:33.488
That was because I was stressed...

476
00:29:33.488 --> 00:29:35.089
about the graduation recital.

477
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:37.659
This is our date, so I don't mind it.

478
00:29:39.198 --> 00:29:40.228
Eun Seok.

479
00:29:41.829 --> 00:29:43.669
You're listening to music.

480
00:29:43.929 --> 00:29:44.998
Have a seat.

481
00:29:46.538 --> 00:29:47.809
Have a seat if you want to listen to music.

482
00:29:52.339 --> 00:29:55.149
You listen to classical music with Do Kyung.

483
00:29:55.448 --> 00:29:56.508
When he was studying abroad,

484
00:29:56.508 --> 00:29:58.149
we once went on a music trip.

485
00:29:59.518 --> 00:30:00.919
The La Scala was great, wasn't it?

486
00:30:01.488 --> 00:30:03.619
Did you like the Covent Garden better?

487
00:30:04.258 --> 00:30:05.859
I said the Metropolitan was the best.

488
00:30:05.958 --> 00:30:06.958
The Vienna State Opera is the second.

489
00:30:07.929 --> 00:30:11.099
Are those the places you visited on the trip?

490
00:30:11.429 --> 00:30:13.298
No, they are opera houses.

491
00:30:14.768 --> 00:30:16.599
You must study a lot to catch up.

492
00:30:17.438 --> 00:30:19.198
I just started studying.

493
00:30:19.198 --> 00:30:21.369
I need to study more.

494
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:25.208
Seo Hyun, I know that you like Mahler,

495
00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:26.579
but Symphony Number 3 is far too long.

496
00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:29.508
Do you want to listen to Number 5, Adagietto?

497
00:30:29.508 --> 00:30:31.179
I'm not a fan of Alma Mahler.

498
00:30:31.179 --> 00:30:32.879
Let's go with Number 2, Resurrection.

499
00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:38.688
What do you think about this song?

500
00:30:39.258 --> 00:30:41.559
I don't know well,

501
00:30:41.758 --> 00:30:44.099
but it's lovely to listen to.

502
00:30:44.698 --> 00:30:46.859
Is that so? Then keep listening.

503
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:50.738
Let's listen to Resurrection after this.

504
00:30:55.339 --> 00:30:56.869
I forgot I had homework.

505
00:30:56.869 --> 00:30:58.738
Eun Suk, I will go back to my room first.

506
00:31:05.748 --> 00:31:07.278
They're so scary.

507
00:31:09.218 --> 00:31:11.159
When will they stop being mad at me?

508
00:31:21.369 --> 00:31:23.268
Eat slowly.

509
00:31:23.429 --> 00:31:25.698
Why are you so crazy about food made with flour?

510
00:31:25.899 --> 00:31:27.369
I got it from you.

511
00:31:27.508 --> 00:31:29.139
Mom always nags you for it,

512
00:31:29.139 --> 00:31:30.409
but you still love eating sujebi.

513
00:31:33.038 --> 00:31:34.048
Ji Soo.

514
00:31:34.409 --> 00:31:36.278
What do you want to do in the future?

515
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:39.748
Do you want to open a bakery?

516
00:31:40.518 --> 00:31:42.589
I don't want a bakery. I don't have money either.

517
00:31:43.988 --> 00:31:46.659
If you had money, would you like to open one?

518
00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:48.559
I have never thought about that.

519
00:31:48.829 --> 00:31:51.258
I just want to make bread.

520
00:31:53.059 --> 00:31:54.099
Then...

521
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:57.329
why don't you make bread professionally?

522
00:31:57.468 --> 00:31:59.669
You can study baking abroad.

523
00:31:59.669 --> 00:32:01.208
Abroad?

524
00:32:01.208 --> 00:32:03.208
No, I don't want to go abroad.

525
00:32:03.538 --> 00:32:05.278
Why do you ask that?

526
00:32:05.478 --> 00:32:07.109
I don't need to study baking abroad.

527
00:32:07.109 --> 00:32:08.448
I just want to...

528
00:32:08.448 --> 00:32:10.508
become Mr. Kang's apprentice.

529
00:32:10.508 --> 00:32:11.579
I just need to learn his skills...

530
00:32:11.579 --> 00:32:13.048
and make the bread exactly like he does.

531
00:32:13.048 --> 00:32:15.119
It's exactly what I was looking for.

532
00:32:17.119 --> 00:32:19.688
It's because I am poor, isn't it?

533
00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:22.958
If your parents were rich, you'd change your mind.

534
00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:25.228
Dad, if I would do that,

535
00:32:25.228 --> 00:32:26.859
why would I have tried stopping Ji An?

536
00:32:26.929 --> 00:32:30.169
- You tried to stop Ji An? - I tried so hard.

537
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:32.399
That's why I don't talk to her anymore.

538
00:32:32.798 --> 00:32:34.839
I would never leave you. Never.

539
00:32:36.339 --> 00:32:37.478
Why wouldn't you?

540
00:32:38.109 --> 00:32:40.708
I love everything I eat.

541
00:32:40.879 --> 00:32:42.579
And I especially love eating bread.

542
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:44.319
I don't need money.

543
00:32:46.119 --> 00:32:48.849
Still, they are your real parents.

544
00:32:48.919 --> 00:32:50.488
What? Dad.

545
00:32:50.488 --> 00:32:53.359
It's such an old-fashioned way of thinking.

546
00:32:53.458 --> 00:32:56.429
Adoption. Share-houses.

547
00:32:56.429 --> 00:32:57.698
These days,

548
00:32:57.698 --> 00:32:59.859
even strangers may become a family.

549
00:33:00.059 --> 00:33:01.429
I read this somewhere.

550
00:33:01.429 --> 00:33:03.768
They say that family means...

551
00:33:03.768 --> 00:33:06.038
"people you share food with."

552
00:33:06.038 --> 00:33:08.438
Anyone you share your food with is your family.

553
00:33:08.438 --> 00:33:10.109
So why would you go to your biological parents...

554
00:33:10.109 --> 00:33:12.609
just because you share blood?

555
00:33:15.079 --> 00:33:16.409
Is that right?

556
00:33:19.319 --> 00:33:21.248
Why do you keep looking at me?

557
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:25.889
I feel full just by watching you eat.

558
00:33:26.919 --> 00:33:29.159
Do you want to eat more? Here, have this.

559
00:33:29.889 --> 00:33:31.429
These noodles are so good,

560
00:33:31.429 --> 00:33:34.069
but the portion is a bit too small, right?

561
00:33:48.748 --> 00:33:50.948
Oh, Do Kyung.

562
00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:53.919
Practice the speech with Eun Seok.

563
00:33:55.448 --> 00:33:57.218
Your aunt and uncle will be there too.

564
00:33:57.288 --> 00:33:59.319
She shouldn't make any mistakes being nervous.

565
00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:01.188
Okay.

566
00:34:02.889 --> 00:34:04.498
Have a good day.

567
00:34:07.528 --> 00:34:08.729
Meet me at 6pm.

568
00:34:08.729 --> 00:34:10.269
Mr. Myung will know where to go.

569
00:34:10.398 --> 00:34:12.568
That's unnecessary.

570
00:34:12.668 --> 00:34:15.108
But it's necessary for our family.

571
00:34:15.809 --> 00:34:17.809
It's my duty as the son of Haesung Corporation...

572
00:34:17.809 --> 00:34:19.479
to teach you if I am told to do so.

573
00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:27.519
(Personnel Transfer Report)

574
00:34:28.448 --> 00:34:29.488
Mr. Sung.

575
00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:30.988
Yes, Vice Chairman Choi.

576
00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.758
Isn't this odd?

577
00:34:32.758 --> 00:34:34.488
Pardon me? What do you mean?

578
00:34:34.488 --> 00:34:36.559
Are these the only temporary employees...

579
00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:38.358
who became regular employees?

580
00:34:38.758 --> 00:34:40.258
Nobody from the Marketing or Sales Department...

581
00:34:40.258 --> 00:34:42.398
became a regular employee. Why is that?

582
00:34:42.398 --> 00:34:43.769
About that...

583
00:34:44.198 --> 00:34:45.698
It was our decision...

584
00:34:45.698 --> 00:34:47.369
to hire someone more equipped for the job.

585
00:34:47.369 --> 00:34:49.168
Did you fill the positions with special admissions?

586
00:34:50.238 --> 00:34:52.409
- Yes. - When advertising...

587
00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:53.608
for temporary employees,

588
00:34:53.608 --> 00:34:55.909
we promised some of them will be hired permanently.

589
00:34:56.249 --> 00:34:57.448
And you ignored that?

590
00:34:57.448 --> 00:35:00.119
Specially admitted people filled in the positions.

591
00:35:00.548 --> 00:35:01.918
And this happened.

592
00:35:03.289 --> 00:35:04.659
This is pathetic.

593
00:35:05.619 --> 00:35:06.758
To save the faces of the executives,

594
00:35:06.758 --> 00:35:09.258
you would jeopardize the company's image?

595
00:35:09.858 --> 00:35:12.028
Temporary employees are a sensitive issue now.

596
00:35:12.028 --> 00:35:13.758
Instead of being a role model,

597
00:35:13.758 --> 00:35:15.198
you broke our promise.

598
00:35:15.198 --> 00:35:17.128
What would that do to our company image?

599
00:35:18.139 --> 00:35:19.298
I apologize, sir.

600
00:35:19.298 --> 00:35:21.668
Give permanent positions to the number of people...

601
00:35:21.668 --> 00:35:22.968
you promised on the advertisement.

602
00:35:23.068 --> 00:35:24.209
I will do that, sir.

603
00:35:24.209 --> 00:35:26.579
Choose among the temporary employees...

604
00:35:26.579 --> 00:35:28.278
in order of their competency.

605
00:35:28.409 --> 00:35:29.849
There must be temporary employees who would've...

606
00:35:29.849 --> 00:35:32.519
been chosen if it weren't for the privileged ones.

607
00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:35.418
Yes. I will fix it and report it to you.

608
00:35:35.588 --> 00:35:36.648
You may leave.

609
00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:49.898
Ji Soo.

610
00:35:50.198 --> 00:35:51.198
Yes?

611
00:35:51.198 --> 00:35:53.269
What are you doing? It's past 10 already.

612
00:35:53.869 --> 00:35:54.968
You should go now.

613
00:35:56.238 --> 00:35:57.269
Okay.

614
00:36:04.948 --> 00:36:07.548
I know the bike man project ended so soon,

615
00:36:07.619 --> 00:36:09.749
but you are in charge of the bread delivery.

616
00:36:09.948 --> 00:36:11.019
I know that.

617
00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:17.959
If they have any unsold, bring it back to me.

618
00:36:18.528 --> 00:36:20.698
- Why? - That's for my pride.

619
00:36:21.028 --> 00:36:22.929
I can't let them sell day-old bread.

620
00:36:24.269 --> 00:36:25.639
Okay.

621
00:36:31.809 --> 00:36:32.838
Go.

622
00:36:47.059 --> 00:36:48.128
Hello.

623
00:36:48.628 --> 00:36:50.028
This is the bread for today.

624
00:36:50.088 --> 00:36:52.758
If you have any bread left from yesterday, give me.

625
00:36:53.358 --> 00:36:55.898
It sold out yesterday.

626
00:36:56.099 --> 00:36:57.798
Oh, is that so?

627
00:36:58.099 --> 00:37:00.039
Okay then. Goodbye.

628
00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:23.789
Gosh, what do I do?

629
00:37:25.798 --> 00:37:28.068
That was so embarrassing. I was like a fool.

630
00:37:28.329 --> 00:37:29.429
Seriously.

631
00:37:32.198 --> 00:37:34.338
Please don't say anything to me.

632
00:37:36.709 --> 00:37:38.439
Don't say anything to you?

633
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:41.979
He feels like a different man.

634
00:37:46.749 --> 00:37:49.119
No... No, Doctor. I can't do that.

635
00:37:49.189 --> 00:37:51.659
You promised me I'll be working at the front desk.

636
00:37:51.659 --> 00:37:53.119
I know.

637
00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:55.659
But Ms. Lee can't come as her appendix burst.

638
00:37:55.959 --> 00:37:57.758
I need someone to take her place.

639
00:37:58.128 --> 00:37:59.929
It's your major though.

640
00:38:00.128 --> 00:38:01.668
Please do this for just one day.

641
00:38:02.698 --> 00:38:05.039
You know I have a lot of patients today.

642
00:38:05.198 --> 00:38:06.898
Doctor.

643
00:38:06.898 --> 00:38:09.168
It's just today. Only one day.

644
00:38:09.568 --> 00:38:11.778
I'll have someone else tomorrow. Okay?

645
00:38:12.608 --> 00:38:14.809
Okay. Good.

646
00:38:16.778 --> 00:38:18.119
- Sir. - Yes?

647
00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:19.249
Please keep your jaw relaxed.

648
00:38:19.249 --> 00:38:20.249
- Okay. - Okay.

649
00:38:21.289 --> 00:38:22.749
That's it.

650
00:38:28.358 --> 00:38:29.429
Ji Soo.

651
00:38:36.068 --> 00:38:37.198
Hold it for just a moment.

652
00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:41.968
- Relax your jaw. - Okay.

653
00:38:42.108 --> 00:38:44.008
- Please be patient. - Okay.

654
00:38:44.179 --> 00:38:45.238
It's almost done.

655
00:38:50.008 --> 00:38:51.679
Okay. It's done.

656
00:38:51.918 --> 00:38:53.278
Thank you for your patience.

657
00:38:53.278 --> 00:38:55.689
Ji Soo, Please wrap it up.

658
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:17.338
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry, sir.

659
00:39:17.338 --> 00:39:19.608
Gosh, what do you think you are doing?

660
00:39:19.608 --> 00:39:22.349
- I'm sorry, sir. - I can't believe this.

661
00:39:24.378 --> 00:39:26.278
Gosh, what is this? Get away from me.

662
00:39:26.679 --> 00:39:29.318
Hey. Darn it!

663
00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:33.159
Did you just retch while looking at my teeth?

664
00:39:33.159 --> 00:39:34.528
Well... About that...

665
00:39:34.528 --> 00:39:37.729
I... I really didn't mean to do that.

666
00:39:37.798 --> 00:39:39.099
You didn't mean to?

667
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:42.068
Gosh, so are you saying...

668
00:39:42.568 --> 00:39:44.539
my teeth are so filthy that it made you retch?

669
00:39:44.539 --> 00:39:47.168
Well... That's just...

670
00:39:47.168 --> 00:39:49.309
Gosh, this is just unbelievable.

671
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:51.008
What kind of wench are you?

672
00:39:52.979 --> 00:39:54.709
What are you?

673
00:39:54.849 --> 00:39:57.849
I know you're upset, but you can't use violence.

674
00:39:58.948 --> 00:40:01.619
Who do you think you are? Why would you butt in?

675
00:40:01.918 --> 00:40:05.318
Do you even know what she just did to me?

676
00:40:05.559 --> 00:40:06.789
Let go, you punk.

677
00:40:09.789 --> 00:40:10.829
By the way...

678
00:40:11.358 --> 00:40:14.769
You wouldn't want to give her settlement money.

679
00:40:15.198 --> 00:40:16.528
And for beating a woman?

680
00:40:17.398 --> 00:40:19.599
Okay. I understand. Please let go of me.

681
00:40:31.878 --> 00:40:33.318
Gosh, this shouldn't get wet.

682
00:40:34.189 --> 00:40:35.519
I must give this to him.

683
00:40:35.718 --> 00:40:36.849
What should I do?

684
00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:18.599
Take this.

685
00:41:32.479 --> 00:41:33.979
Well, this is for you...

686
00:41:38.318 --> 00:41:40.849
I only chose the good ones.

687
00:41:44.918 --> 00:41:47.119
He was so nice...

688
00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:51.059
and kind to me back then. But why be like this now?

689
00:42:01.039 --> 00:42:02.369
Why do I hate her so much?

690
00:42:02.869 --> 00:42:04.439
That is why I don't like her.

691
00:42:04.608 --> 00:42:07.309
She doesn't even say hi because she's embarrassed.

692
00:42:09.778 --> 00:42:11.179
She was just like that back then.

693
00:42:15.048 --> 00:42:18.258
A dental hygienist who retches at her patient?

694
00:42:20.119 --> 00:42:22.858
After that fuss, she went out to buy some bread.

695
00:42:22.858 --> 00:42:24.028
And she came back eating it.

696
00:42:26.298 --> 00:42:28.429
She's like a ghost that starved to death.

697
00:42:29.668 --> 00:42:30.869
Gosh, she was ridiculous.

698
00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:33.869
How would I like such a woman?

699
00:42:34.468 --> 00:42:36.209
I'd even hate her if she were a man.

700
00:42:36.439 --> 00:42:38.108
She's irresponsible and indifferent.

701
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:39.608
She's just so gluttonous.

702
00:42:41.608 --> 00:42:44.548
Not all people can be smart and skillful.

703
00:42:44.548 --> 00:42:47.278
It's not that she isn't smart. She's pathetic.

704
00:42:47.519 --> 00:42:49.548
She worked at a dental clinic and a restaurant.

705
00:42:49.548 --> 00:42:50.619
And now, she works at a bakery.

706
00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:53.119
She doesn't even have a goal in her life.

707
00:42:53.318 --> 00:42:54.659
She has no plans.

708
00:42:54.758 --> 00:42:57.289
You didn't tell her what you just said,

709
00:42:57.289 --> 00:42:58.798
did you?

710
00:42:59.159 --> 00:43:00.999
I just told her I like someone else.

711
00:43:01.929 --> 00:43:03.269
And I asked her not to say anything to me.

712
00:43:04.099 --> 00:43:05.468
You're mean.

713
00:43:06.769 --> 00:43:09.269
I would've been mean if I gave her false hope.

714
00:43:09.439 --> 00:43:11.179
Is it mean to help her move on?

715
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:15.079
Mom and Aunt don't get on well each other.

716
00:43:16.249 --> 00:43:17.479
And Chairman No Yang Ho doesn't want to...

717
00:43:17.479 --> 00:43:19.378
hand over the company to his daughters.

718
00:43:20.378 --> 00:43:22.318
He found a good guy for his son-in-law instead.

719
00:43:23.088 --> 00:43:24.459
It's Dad and President Jung Myung Soo.

720
00:43:25.619 --> 00:43:28.059
That's why Mom and Aunt don't get along.

721
00:43:28.559 --> 00:43:30.798
Dad is the vice president though.

722
00:43:31.358 --> 00:43:32.959
Why would they not get along?

723
00:43:33.059 --> 00:43:35.499
It's not guaranteed that he'll be the president.

724
00:43:35.968 --> 00:43:37.439
It could be Dad, Uncle, or someone else.

725
00:43:37.798 --> 00:43:40.369
Chairman No left the position open.

726
00:43:41.369 --> 00:43:43.869
But Mom is his eldest daughter.

727
00:43:43.869 --> 00:43:45.939
- Then why... - Straighten your back.

728
00:43:47.979 --> 00:43:49.179
Your face has a set expression.

729
00:43:52.019 --> 00:43:54.088
Didn't Ms. Yang teach you abdominal respiration?

730
00:43:54.519 --> 00:43:55.789
What have you learned from her so far?

731
00:43:57.389 --> 00:44:00.119
Make sure to speak with a smile no matter what.

732
00:44:00.488 --> 00:44:01.758
Keep your back straight.

733
00:44:03.028 --> 00:44:05.398
As I talked about Mom and Aunt,

734
00:44:05.398 --> 00:44:07.298
you became a little girl who likes to gossip.

735
00:44:08.999 --> 00:44:10.298
I'm sorry.

736
00:44:15.008 --> 00:44:16.108
Let's eat.

737
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:30.718
- You're hopeless. - Pardon?

738
00:44:42.329 --> 00:44:45.139
Cut meat in small pieces. Take small sips of wine.

739
00:44:46.168 --> 00:44:48.508
Can't you even eat food properly?

740
00:44:49.838 --> 00:44:51.179
Okay. I'll remember that.

741
00:44:52.008 --> 00:44:54.548
This dinner table is not just about eating food.

742
00:44:54.648 --> 00:44:56.378
The point is what happens during the dinner.

743
00:44:57.048 --> 00:44:59.619
The food is just a prop for a smooth conversation.

744
00:44:59.619 --> 00:45:01.088
Especially in business.

745
00:45:01.718 --> 00:45:03.918
Don't lose your mind by focusing on eating.

746
00:45:04.258 --> 00:45:06.758
In front of Chairman No, President No and Jung.

747
00:45:07.729 --> 00:45:08.889
Okay.

748
00:45:13.258 --> 00:45:14.869
Grandpa was a son of a butcher.

749
00:45:16.729 --> 00:45:19.599
But now, he's here today. He's not an ordinary man.

750
00:45:20.668 --> 00:45:22.338
He has a humble taste,

751
00:45:22.338 --> 00:45:24.108
but that doesn't mean he's easygoing or something.

752
00:45:24.778 --> 00:45:26.309
He's a redoubtable man.

753
00:45:28.448 --> 00:45:29.709
His word is the law,

754
00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:31.418
the path, and the truth.

755
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:32.979
Okay.

756
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:48.329
Leave it.

757
00:45:49.099 --> 00:45:50.099
Yes, sir.

758
00:45:53.798 --> 00:45:54.838
Leave your glass.

759
00:45:57.539 --> 00:45:59.108
When someone pours you wine,

760
00:45:59.209 --> 00:46:01.148
leave the glass on the table.

761
00:46:01.608 --> 00:46:03.479
That means you trust the sommelier...

762
00:46:03.479 --> 00:46:05.519
or whoever is serving you.

763
00:46:09.148 --> 00:46:11.858
I didn't learn that yet.

764
00:46:11.858 --> 00:46:13.619
You could've noticed that night...

765
00:46:13.619 --> 00:46:15.028
when we had dinner together.

766
00:46:15.559 --> 00:46:16.858
You're dull-witted.

767
00:46:26.738 --> 00:46:28.409
I'm done eating.

768
00:46:33.278 --> 00:46:35.409
- Let's go then. - There's still dessert.

769
00:46:38.849 --> 00:46:41.389
You still think we're here to eat.

770
00:46:41.889 --> 00:46:44.289
There's no point in eating dessert with someone...

771
00:46:44.289 --> 00:46:46.019
who forgets everything she hears.

772
00:46:47.218 --> 00:46:48.229
Let's go.

773
00:47:02.968 --> 00:47:04.079
You could've...

774
00:47:05.108 --> 00:47:07.108
called for a designated driver.

775
00:47:07.108 --> 00:47:08.778
Why didn't you have any wine?

776
00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:15.418
I asked a question.

777
00:47:15.418 --> 00:47:17.218
Isn't it rude to ignore it...

778
00:47:17.389 --> 00:47:18.718
and not answer?

779
00:47:18.718 --> 00:47:21.258
I told the waiter at the restaurant...

780
00:47:21.488 --> 00:47:24.099
that I won't drink because I must drive.

781
00:47:24.459 --> 00:47:26.258
I made my intentions clear,

782
00:47:26.258 --> 00:47:28.599
so not asking why I didn't call a driver...

783
00:47:28.869 --> 00:47:30.968
is something only close friends can do.

784
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:35.568
I understand.

785
00:47:42.179 --> 00:47:43.448
Don't look around.

786
00:47:43.979 --> 00:47:45.548
It's very unrefined to...

787
00:47:45.548 --> 00:47:47.648
look around someone else's car,

788
00:47:47.749 --> 00:47:49.648
and I dislike it very much.

789
00:47:49.749 --> 00:47:51.588
You're spying my personal space.

790
00:47:52.789 --> 00:47:54.329
I wasn't spying.

791
00:47:54.729 --> 00:47:56.059
I was looking for water because I was thirsty.

792
00:47:56.059 --> 00:47:57.929
If there is any here, is it yours?

793
00:47:58.298 --> 00:47:59.698
It's someone else's space.

794
00:47:59.929 --> 00:48:01.668
Can you drink anything you find?

795
00:48:01.668 --> 00:48:03.898
"I am thirsty. Do you have water?"

796
00:48:04.599 --> 00:48:05.869
Is that so hard?

797
00:48:07.099 --> 00:48:09.738
Are we strangers?

798
00:48:09.738 --> 00:48:12.378
Anyone other than yourself is a stranger.

799
00:48:12.608 --> 00:48:15.249
And I don't have any water.

800
00:48:17.849 --> 00:48:19.878
If you're impolite, at least be quick-witted.

801
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:10.838
Is she sick?

802
00:49:12.338 --> 00:49:13.798
Did she take some medicine?

803
00:49:14.539 --> 00:49:15.769
I'm sure she did.

804
00:49:15.769 --> 00:49:17.439
She'll call Ms. Min if she needs help.

805
00:49:18.778 --> 00:49:20.139
Why am I worried?

806
00:49:20.139 --> 00:49:21.209
She'd survive even if...

807
00:49:21.209 --> 00:49:22.648
she was to be left in a desert.

808
00:49:42.429 --> 00:49:43.528
Ji Soo.

809
00:49:44.939 --> 00:49:46.769
I'm sick.

810
00:49:48.809 --> 00:49:49.838
Medicine?

811
00:49:51.508 --> 00:49:53.108
I don't know where it is.

812
00:49:54.409 --> 00:49:56.179
I'm scared to ask.

813
00:49:58.318 --> 00:49:59.479
If I said...

814
00:50:01.588 --> 00:50:03.349
I did too much wrong to a man...

815
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:05.258
who turned out to be my brother...

816
00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:09.659
and couldn't keep down what we ate for dinner,

817
00:50:11.159 --> 00:50:13.258
they might treat me even worse.

818
00:50:15.198 --> 00:50:16.398
My sister?

819
00:50:19.738 --> 00:50:21.338
She won't let me in.

820
00:50:23.039 --> 00:50:24.939
If you were here,

821
00:50:25.378 --> 00:50:27.679
you'd have caused a fuss...

822
00:50:27.948 --> 00:50:30.718
and pricked my finger to let out blood.

823
00:50:37.988 --> 00:50:39.218
I miss you.

824
00:50:42.059 --> 00:50:43.329
I feel...

825
00:50:44.758 --> 00:50:46.358
so lonely here.

826
00:51:07.948 --> 00:51:11.289
Sorry I'm late. I was on the phone with France.

827
00:51:11.289 --> 00:51:12.659
Well done.

828
00:51:14.889 --> 00:51:16.789
Why are you eating this?

829
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:20.159
What's wrong with this?

830
00:51:20.528 --> 00:51:22.429
I like western food.

831
00:51:25.269 --> 00:51:26.869
Do you have a lot to do today?

832
00:51:29.709 --> 00:51:31.338
Ms. Yang will teach me...

833
00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:33.179
manners and arts this morning.

834
00:51:33.209 --> 00:51:35.479
Then I learn about makeup in Cheongdam-dong,

835
00:51:35.479 --> 00:51:37.209
and I have Pilates training afterwards.

836
00:51:37.209 --> 00:51:38.878
After that, I have English lessons.

837
00:51:39.019 --> 00:51:40.019
What about lunch?

838
00:51:41.749 --> 00:51:43.918
You should give her time to eat.

839
00:51:44.889 --> 00:51:46.889
I told her to pack some sandwiches.

840
00:51:47.059 --> 00:51:49.189
She'll have little time to eat at the company.

841
00:51:49.459 --> 00:51:51.959
She must learn as much as she can before that.

842
00:51:52.099 --> 00:51:53.729
Hang in there for just a few more days.

843
00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:55.999
Things will get better once you're at work.

844
00:51:56.298 --> 00:51:57.798
Yes, I understand.

845
00:52:07.608 --> 00:52:10.148
(Vietnam economy)

846
00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:26.099
- Ji An. - Hey.

847
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:44.979
Who is this?

848
00:52:45.749 --> 00:52:46.878
Ji Soo.

849
00:52:47.148 --> 00:52:49.148
What... What happened to your voice?

850
00:52:50.519 --> 00:52:52.189
Ji An.

851
00:52:58.229 --> 00:53:00.798
Something urgent came up. Go back home first.

852
00:53:01.229 --> 00:53:02.798
- Taxi. - Miss.

853
00:53:07.769 --> 00:53:08.769
Ji Soo.

854
00:53:13.079 --> 00:53:14.508
Who are you?

855
00:53:15.048 --> 00:53:17.048
Why do you look like Ji An?

856
00:53:17.849 --> 00:53:19.849
You can't even drink half a can of beer.

857
00:53:21.849 --> 00:53:23.918
Ji Soo, what's wrong?

858
00:53:25.389 --> 00:53:27.189
Is it really you?

859
00:53:27.358 --> 00:53:30.798
- Gosh. It really is you. - Yes, it's me.

860
00:53:31.559 --> 00:53:32.798
Don't be silly.

861
00:53:34.769 --> 00:53:36.198
Look out, Ji Soo.

862
00:53:36.729 --> 00:53:38.499
Ji Soo, are you all right?

863
00:53:38.738 --> 00:53:40.769
Let go. Let go of me.

864
00:53:40.769 --> 00:53:43.108
Why are you holding me back?

865
00:53:43.238 --> 00:53:45.709
Leave. I cut you out of my life.

866
00:53:45.709 --> 00:53:47.179
I cut you out.

867
00:53:47.179 --> 00:53:48.548
Ji Soo.

868
00:53:50.209 --> 00:53:51.979
What happened to you?

869
00:53:53.548 --> 00:53:55.189
He told me...

870
00:53:56.289 --> 00:53:57.918
not to do it.

871
00:53:58.789 --> 00:54:00.929
He says I should not say anything.

872
00:54:01.889 --> 00:54:03.789
He told me not to say anything.

873
00:54:04.528 --> 00:54:06.398
Did you confess to Mr. Sun?

874
00:54:06.398 --> 00:54:07.898
No.

875
00:54:08.668 --> 00:54:11.698
I haven't said anything to him yet,

876
00:54:11.869 --> 00:54:14.439
but he told me not to.

877
00:54:15.168 --> 00:54:16.939
- Come here. - Why?

878
00:54:18.508 --> 00:54:21.349
Sit down here and tell me what happened.

879
00:54:21.709 --> 00:54:23.409
What do you mean by you saying nothing,

880
00:54:23.409 --> 00:54:25.579
and him telling you not to say anything?

881
00:54:25.718 --> 00:54:27.849
He likes someone else.

882
00:54:28.488 --> 00:54:30.148
He likes someone else?

883
00:54:30.619 --> 00:54:32.718
Yes, he said so.

884
00:54:33.889 --> 00:54:35.229
No, he does.

885
00:54:35.959 --> 00:54:37.898
I actually saw her.

886
00:54:40.528 --> 00:54:42.468
And you still like him?

887
00:54:43.068 --> 00:54:46.338
Didn't you even check on things like that?

888
00:54:46.338 --> 00:54:47.769
You said you spied on him.

889
00:54:47.769 --> 00:54:49.568
Didn't you know he had a girlfriend?

890
00:54:49.568 --> 00:54:51.878
No, that's not it.

891
00:54:51.878 --> 00:54:54.878
I don't know yet if she's his girlfriend.

892
00:54:54.878 --> 00:54:57.378
Do you think I'm an idiot?

893
00:54:57.378 --> 00:55:00.119
Would I like a guy who has a girlfriend?

894
00:55:00.119 --> 00:55:01.418
Even if they aren't dating,

895
00:55:01.418 --> 00:55:03.488
you said you saw the girl he likes.

896
00:55:04.119 --> 00:55:05.918
You should've given up then...

897
00:55:05.918 --> 00:55:08.028
or told him you liked him sooner.

898
00:55:08.028 --> 00:55:09.988
I wrote down what you should say.

899
00:55:09.988 --> 00:55:11.528
Why didn't you read that...

900
00:55:11.528 --> 00:55:13.628
only to end up in this mess? This is upsetting.

901
00:55:14.229 --> 00:55:15.869
Are you upset?

902
00:55:16.798 --> 00:55:20.599
Right now... I feel like...

903
00:55:20.668 --> 00:55:23.769
someone's stabbing me here with a needle.

904
00:55:28.508 --> 00:55:29.548
Does it hurt a lot?

905
00:55:30.479 --> 00:55:31.519
Yes.

906
00:55:31.679 --> 00:55:33.119
You know,

907
00:55:33.218 --> 00:55:35.849
it feels like a really small needle,

908
00:55:36.148 --> 00:55:37.689
something 10 times smaller...

909
00:55:37.689 --> 00:55:39.988
than what you use to sew things up,

910
00:55:40.019 --> 00:55:43.929
is stabbing my heart, and it hurts a lot.

911
00:55:45.898 --> 00:55:47.159
It must really hurt.

912
00:55:49.329 --> 00:55:50.869
What should I do now?

913
00:55:51.898 --> 00:55:52.898
Get over him.

914
00:55:53.798 --> 00:55:55.369
If the guy's that adamant,

915
00:55:56.008 --> 00:55:57.108
it won't work.

916
00:55:58.579 --> 00:56:00.608
If I tell myself to forget,

917
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:02.948
will I be able to?

918
00:56:03.148 --> 00:56:05.418
Stop drinking.

919
00:56:08.019 --> 00:56:11.318
I see why you always drank beer.

920
00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:13.959
Drinking this...

921
00:56:14.059 --> 00:56:16.189
makes the pain go away.

922
00:56:16.929 --> 00:56:19.028
I feel so dizzy.

923
00:56:20.298 --> 00:56:21.929
No, Ji Soo.

924
00:56:22.528 --> 00:56:23.528
Ji Soo.

925
00:56:36.579 --> 00:56:39.619
Get rid of everything Eun Seok brought with her.

926
00:56:44.088 --> 00:56:45.488
My goodness, Ji An.

927
00:56:45.488 --> 00:56:48.128
What happened to her?

928
00:56:48.858 --> 00:56:50.559
What happened?

929
00:56:50.858 --> 00:56:52.028
Oh, dear.

930
00:56:56.769 --> 00:56:58.468
Thank you. You should go.

931
00:56:58.468 --> 00:57:00.238
Mom, let me catch my breath.

932
00:57:00.568 --> 00:57:03.338
Go home. Why do you keep coming here?

933
00:57:03.338 --> 00:57:07.979
Well, I called Ji Soo, but she was drunk.

934
00:57:08.108 --> 00:57:11.818
You should've called me. Why did you come over?

935
00:57:11.818 --> 00:57:13.378
Don't do that ever again.

936
00:57:15.418 --> 00:57:17.218
Don't scold her.

937
00:57:17.918 --> 00:57:19.619
Dad's in Seoul.

938
00:57:19.619 --> 00:57:21.858
Get going before he sees you.

939
00:57:22.059 --> 00:57:26.758
- I'll call you soon. - But is Dad okay?

940
00:57:26.758 --> 00:57:27.999
Yes, now go.

941
00:57:31.099 --> 00:57:33.869
Taxi service? This is Daebang-dong...

942
00:57:48.918 --> 00:57:50.588
Dad, I'm sorry.

943
00:58:10.439 --> 00:58:12.979
Why does she always cause trouble?

944
00:58:13.709 --> 00:58:15.778
Why? Did something happen again?

945
00:58:15.778 --> 00:58:17.278
Was she sick by any chance?

946
00:58:17.278 --> 00:58:18.548
Not at all.

947
00:58:18.579 --> 00:58:20.948
She skipped all her lessons and disappeared.

948
00:58:21.318 --> 00:58:22.789
Again?

949
00:58:23.088 --> 00:58:24.818
She also took back her necklace.

950
00:58:25.758 --> 00:58:27.689
Does she even want to become our family?

951
00:58:27.929 --> 00:58:29.229
What necklace?

952
00:58:29.488 --> 00:58:30.959
The one you gave her.

953
00:58:31.229 --> 00:58:34.229
She wanted it back saying she'd been rude to you.

954
00:58:34.628 --> 00:58:37.229
I guess she looked up how much it cost.

955
00:58:39.698 --> 00:58:42.209
Sorry. I didn't think it through.

956
00:58:42.769 --> 00:58:45.979
Everything you said yesterday is right.

957
00:58:55.988 --> 00:58:56.988
What's all that?

958
00:58:57.048 --> 00:58:59.059
Ms. No told me to get rid of it all.

959
00:59:07.729 --> 00:59:10.468
She finally got herself into this mess.

960
00:59:15.668 --> 00:59:17.039
I'm home.

961
00:59:24.718 --> 00:59:25.979
I'm sorry.

962
00:59:27.548 --> 00:59:28.619
Sit.

963
00:59:34.889 --> 00:59:36.789
I didn't ask for permission...

964
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:38.829
It must have been related to your old family.

965
00:59:40.968 --> 00:59:44.298
Yes. My sister was having a hard time.

966
00:59:44.298 --> 00:59:46.139
You joined our family now.

967
00:59:46.139 --> 00:59:48.008
You're a member of the Haesung family.

968
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:51.139
I set a schedule so you wouldn't be so foolish.

969
00:59:51.139 --> 00:59:52.508
Yet, you let me down like this?

970
00:59:53.539 --> 00:59:55.179
I thought you were smart.

971
00:59:55.579 --> 00:59:57.048
I was wrong.

972
00:59:58.148 --> 00:59:59.249
We were twins...

973
00:59:59.948 --> 01:00:02.488
for the past 25 years.

974
01:00:03.689 --> 01:00:04.959
She needed me.

975
01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:10.488
I said we must make up for the lost 25 years...

976
01:00:11.198 --> 01:00:13.429
and that you shouldn't go off alone.

977
01:00:14.369 --> 01:00:15.999
Do you not know what that means?

978
01:00:17.668 --> 01:00:20.568
I can't cut them out of my life...

979
01:00:20.568 --> 01:00:22.369
just like that, Mother.

980
01:00:23.838 --> 01:00:25.738
There's nothing you can't do with determination.

981
01:00:26.238 --> 01:00:29.778
Do you think you can be higher or special...

982
01:00:29.878 --> 01:00:33.679
by acting like others and doing all you wish?

983
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:37.689
She is my sister.

984
01:00:37.689 --> 01:00:39.218
She used to be.

985
01:00:39.519 --> 01:00:40.659
Mother.

986
01:00:41.628 --> 01:00:44.659
Fine. This girl who was your sister.

987
01:00:44.698 --> 01:00:46.499
Let's hear about...

988
01:00:46.528 --> 01:00:48.528
why you needed to be there for her.

989
01:00:51.568 --> 01:00:54.738
Was the girl who was your sister at death's door?

990
01:00:56.508 --> 01:00:57.679
Why...

991
01:00:58.378 --> 01:01:00.909
Why am I not allowed to see my family?

992
01:01:01.979 --> 01:01:04.008
Just because I'm with you now...

993
01:01:04.318 --> 01:01:06.519
doesn't mean they're no longer my family.

994
01:01:07.119 --> 01:01:09.148
My siblings cannot become strangers.

995
01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:12.218
Is that so?

996
01:01:13.918 --> 01:01:15.758
Here, I'm Eun Seok,

997
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:18.858
but...

998
01:01:19.159 --> 01:01:22.568
I'm still Seo Ji An no matter how hard I try.

999
01:01:22.568 --> 01:01:23.568
Then...

1000
01:01:24.238 --> 01:01:26.769
shall I call you Ji An and not Eun Seok?

1001
01:01:29.238 --> 01:01:30.238
I'm not...

1002
01:01:30.778 --> 01:01:32.909
used to all this yet.

1003
01:01:34.448 --> 01:01:36.278
Until the paperwork's complete,

1004
01:01:37.818 --> 01:01:39.119
I'd like you to...

1005
01:01:39.718 --> 01:01:42.048
call me Ji An.

1006
01:01:49.088 --> 01:01:50.429
The choice to return...

1007
01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:53.659
was yours, so do not forget that.

1008
01:01:53.659 --> 01:01:54.729
With choices...

1009
01:01:55.298 --> 01:01:56.869
come responsibilities.

1010
01:01:57.499 --> 01:01:58.999
Didn't you think of that?

1011
01:02:02.439 --> 01:02:03.639
Because of you,

1012
01:02:03.639 --> 01:02:05.679
me, your dad, brother, and sister...

1013
01:02:06.108 --> 01:02:07.648
will all become fodder for gossip.

1014
01:02:08.979 --> 01:02:10.048
If that were to happen,

1015
01:02:12.048 --> 01:02:13.718
you shouldn't have come back.

1016
01:02:32.168 --> 01:02:34.439
I don't know what she's thinking.

1017
01:02:35.068 --> 01:02:36.338
Okay, so keep quiet.

1018
01:02:40.979 --> 01:02:41.979
Eun Seok.

1019
01:02:43.878 --> 01:02:47.249
You can't talk back to Mom and Dad like that.

1020
01:02:48.318 --> 01:02:52.019
Just do as you're told. Is that so hard?

1021
01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:54.689
If I had grown up here like you did,

1022
01:02:55.528 --> 01:02:58.298
it would've been easy to follow the rules.

1023
01:03:00.229 --> 01:03:02.829
Sorry for making you bother.

1024
01:03:22.853 --> 01:03:27.853
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1025
01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:42.269
Ms. Min.

1026
01:03:42.369 --> 01:03:44.738
Everything I brought is gone from my room.

1027
01:03:46.639 --> 01:03:48.948
I took everything by Ms. No's order.

1028
01:03:49.448 --> 01:03:50.778
Where to?

1029
01:03:50.979 --> 01:03:53.119
I threw everything away.

1030
01:03:55.418 --> 01:03:56.648
What do you mean?

1031
01:03:57.148 --> 01:03:59.559
How... How could you do that to my possessions...

1032
01:03:59.559 --> 01:04:01.429
without my permission? They're mine.

1033
01:04:02.059 --> 01:04:03.889
We only did as we were told.

1034
01:04:03.889 --> 01:04:06.459
Where are they? Where do you keep the trash?

1035
01:04:06.858 --> 01:04:08.528
They'll be gone by now.

1036
01:04:23.749 --> 01:04:24.749
What should I do?

1037
01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:27.619
What should I do?

1038
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:05.258
How could there not be even a single can of beer?

1039
01:05:26.039 --> 01:05:27.039
Seo Ji An.

1040
01:06:00.338 --> 01:06:02.749
(My Golden Life)

1041
01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:05.519
Is this her?

1042
01:06:05.979 --> 01:06:07.448
I'm Eun Seok.

1043
01:06:08.418 --> 01:06:09.418
That's tomorrow.

1044
01:06:09.418 --> 01:06:10.918
What are you doing with her tomorrow?

1045
01:06:10.918 --> 01:06:12.258
It's a secret.

1046
01:06:12.559 --> 01:06:14.358
Hey, Eun Seok!

1047
01:06:15.588 --> 01:06:17.088
Gosh, what am I doing?

1048
01:06:17.088 --> 01:06:18.128
Do Kyung!

1049
01:06:18.128 --> 01:06:19.229
Yes, I'm here!

1050
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:21.028
What's wrong with her?

1051
01:06:21.099 --> 01:06:22.869
She must've liked you a lot.

1052
01:06:22.898 --> 01:06:25.238
Can't you deliver the bread to the cafe?

1053
01:06:25.238 --> 01:06:26.838
No. I'm the owner.

1054
01:06:26.838 --> 01:06:29.439
Why would I? Gosh.

1055
01:06:29.439 --> 01:06:31.278
I got a call that I became a regular employee...

1056
01:06:31.278 --> 01:06:32.479
for the Marketing Team.
