00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.462
(All organizations, locations, religions, and characters...)

2
00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:20.192
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:23.962
I think my dad joined hands with that cult leader.

4
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:27.471
Sang Mi and I will have a spiritual wedding...

5
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:30.401
where we will become one.

6
00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:32.012
"Don't ever come back"?

7
00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:33.812
Do you think this is a warning or a threat?

8
00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:35.642
Who are you?

9
00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:37.382
I just know that she's an undercover journalist.

10
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:39.251
We can't just go in there.

11
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:40.312
We need to get out of here.

12
00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:41.952
- Sister Kim. - Our wishes will be fulfilled!

13
00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:43.452
I'll save everyone.

14
00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:46.621
I'm going to destroy this place no matter what.

15
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:48.291
Sang Mi!

16
00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:53.032
This tranquilizer can even knock down an elephant with just one shot.

17
00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:55.962
Mom! Apostle Kang gave my mom an injection.

18
00:00:56.132 --> 00:00:58.102
I'll look into what that could've been.

19
00:00:58.272 --> 00:01:01.702
Who knew he'd find a dead body too? We found a wallet...

20
00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:03.102
- right beside the body. - Please find my granddaughter.

21
00:01:03.102 --> 00:01:04.172
There was a social security card inside.

22
00:01:04.172 --> 00:01:06.742
What on earth are you guys up to?

23
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.412
You're doing all this because I look like the girl you killed?

24
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:12.011
Is that why you chose me and my family?

25
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:16.252
If you keep this up,

26
00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:18.722
I might have to change my ways.

27
00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:26.662
(Episode 13)

28
00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:29.462
Try all you want,

29
00:01:31.572 --> 00:01:33.431
and scream for help.

30
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:38.141
Here, there's only one person who can save you.

31
00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:40.472
Me.

32
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.112
There's no one else.

33
00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:56.261
Are you saying...

34
00:01:56.862 --> 00:01:59.231
you're doing all this because I look like the girl you killed?

35
00:02:00.132 --> 00:02:02.362
Is that why you chose me and my family?

36
00:02:05.802 --> 00:02:07.942
If you keep this up,

37
00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:13.072
I might have to change my ways.

38
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.342
Please, just a second.

39
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:29.662
Now, I know...

40
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:32.562
that you can...

41
00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:37.032
do whatever you want to do to me whenever you please.

42
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.372
So please...

43
00:02:41.842 --> 00:02:44.072
I promise I won't run away.

44
00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:48.842
If this is really my fate,

45
00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:54.722
please help me...

46
00:02:55.722 --> 00:02:58.152
accept you with all of my heart.

47
00:02:59.752 --> 00:03:01.622
I need just a little more time.

48
00:03:09.602 --> 00:03:10.831
Can I...

49
00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:14.231
really trust you?

50
00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:18.342
Yes.

51
00:03:25.152 --> 00:03:26.412
Good.

52
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:30.652
Until the day the fruit will ripen to perfection,

53
00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:33.451
I will wait.

54
00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:41.961
Are you okay?

55
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.372
Where am I?

56
00:03:45.602 --> 00:03:49.102
You should never swallow the pills Apostle Kang gives you from now on.

57
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:52.872
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:54.782
Listen to me if you want to save Sang Mi.

59
00:03:54.782 --> 00:03:56.312
Don't forget this.

60
00:04:04.352 --> 00:04:07.092
Sister Kim seems to be awake now.

61
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:11.692
Please help her get up.

62
00:04:22.672 --> 00:04:25.242
Do you know where you are?

63
00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:29.442
Paradise.

64
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:33.482
The place where my dear Sang Jin is.

65
00:04:35.752 --> 00:04:37.922
Yes, that's right.

66
00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:40.521
Would you like to take your medicine now?

67
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:45.932
Open up.

68
00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:55.841
There you go.

69
00:04:56.372 --> 00:04:59.971
You have to take the medicine so you won't get sick again.

70
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:05.211
Good job.

71
00:05:05.482 --> 00:05:09.122
Please get some rest now. Okay?

72
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:13.692
Salvation.

73
00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:16.862
Eternal life.

74
00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.002
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

75
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.432
Are you okay?

76
00:06:02.172 --> 00:06:03.242
Yes.

77
00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:05.911
You didn't look good when you walked out of there.

78
00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:09.482
I'm fine.

79
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.351
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:14.112 --> 00:06:16.021
- I caused trouble to you all. - Don't be.

81
00:06:16.622 --> 00:06:19.122
We've always been like this.

82
00:06:23.891 --> 00:06:26.932
Dong Cheol, what are you doing over there?

83
00:06:28.362 --> 00:06:32.031
I ran into her after using the toilet. I was asking her something.

84
00:06:44.312 --> 00:06:45.382
Asking her what?

85
00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:49.382
She seemed to be around my age,

86
00:06:50.052 --> 00:06:53.292
so I asked her which elementary school she went to.

87
00:07:01.201 --> 00:07:03.862
Spiritual Mother. Where are you going?

88
00:07:07.572 --> 00:07:08.742
To see my mom.

89
00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:11.812
Please go inside.

90
00:07:13.672 --> 00:07:15.841
You're not supposed to see your mom for a while.

91
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:17.911
Okay.

92
00:07:23.752 --> 00:07:25.992
- Dong Cheol. - Yes?

93
00:07:25.992 --> 00:07:30.362
You shouldn't talk to Spiritual Mother casually like that.

94
00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:32.362
I just thought she's around my age.

95
00:07:32.362 --> 00:07:35.401
She is a very special person to everyone in Guseonwon.

96
00:07:35.831 --> 00:07:37.302
Please be careful from now on.

97
00:07:37.732 --> 00:07:38.831
Okay.

98
00:07:39.372 --> 00:07:42.771
By the way, why is she special?

99
00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.372
You're curious about so many things.

100
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:51.752
I have to ask if I'm curious about something.

101
00:07:53.612 --> 00:07:54.851
All right.

102
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:59.692
She's someone who will cleanse us of our original sin.

103
00:07:59.692 --> 00:08:02.221
She's taking a 40-day spiritual training now.

104
00:08:02.221 --> 00:08:04.992
If she speaks to someone who is spiritually inadequate,

105
00:08:04.992 --> 00:08:06.632
it will disrupt her spirit.

106
00:08:06.632 --> 00:08:10.502
That's why you shouldn't talk to her like you did earlier.

107
00:08:10.502 --> 00:08:11.632
Do you understand?

108
00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:14.232
Yes. I'm very sorry.

109
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:03.081
Did you want to see me?

110
00:09:06.422 --> 00:09:08.892
If you keep doing this,

111
00:09:09.522 --> 00:09:13.892
I may have to change my ways.

112
00:09:22.072 --> 00:09:26.711
These are all proof that apocalypse is near.

113
00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:29.711
Would you waste your life while drinking...

114
00:09:29.711 --> 00:09:33.711
just like other people when apocalypse is upon us?

115
00:09:33.711 --> 00:09:39.022
Or would you get ready for the day of salvation here?

116
00:09:40.192 --> 00:09:42.392
We should get ready for the day of salvation.

117
00:09:42.922 --> 00:09:44.162
That's right.

118
00:09:44.591 --> 00:09:49.532
Everyone, do you believe that Almighty will save us?

119
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:51.902
- We believe it. - We believe it.

120
00:09:52.532 --> 00:09:53.701
Let's believe it.

121
00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:56.402
All right, that's all for today.

122
00:09:56.501 --> 00:09:59.312
All together now. Our wishes will be fulfilled.

123
00:09:59.312 --> 00:10:00.312
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

124
00:10:00.312 --> 00:10:01.442
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

125
00:10:02.182 --> 00:10:03.611
Thank you.

126
00:10:03.782 --> 00:10:06.881
If you go outside, you'll see the van.

127
00:10:06.881 --> 00:10:07.981
Please get on it.

128
00:10:08.552 --> 00:10:09.552
All right.

129
00:10:11.621 --> 00:10:13.621
- Dong Cheol. - Yes?

130
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:15.491
Can I talk to you for a second?

131
00:10:15.922 --> 00:10:17.361
Sure.

132
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:22.361
- Bye. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

133
00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:24.471
What is it?

134
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:27.072
I heard you've met with Spiritual Mother alone before.

135
00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:30.741
Oh, I took the wrong way then.

136
00:10:31.772 --> 00:10:35.741
I was startled because I thought I'd really become blind,

137
00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:38.711
but I didn't.

138
00:10:41.922 --> 00:10:45.451
That's because you have a clear and pure soul.

139
00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:49.961
If you work hard to train your spirituality,

140
00:10:49.961 --> 00:10:53.231
you can win the first-class ticket to the Boat of Salvation.

141
00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:57.131
You have to do your best during the training camp, okay?

142
00:10:57.402 --> 00:10:58.402
Well...

143
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:01.672
I'm not sure about staying in a camp.

144
00:11:01.672 --> 00:11:03.672
Don't you want to go to the paradise?

145
00:11:03.672 --> 00:11:05.542
I do, but...

146
00:11:05.542 --> 00:11:08.912
Depending on how deep your faith is,

147
00:11:08.912 --> 00:11:11.912
your parents can get on the Boat of Salvation too.

148
00:11:11.912 --> 00:11:13.951
Are you going to let your loved ones...

149
00:11:14.422 --> 00:11:16.221
fall into the fire pit?

150
00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:18.152
I'm not.

151
00:11:18.652 --> 00:11:21.422
When will the training camp start?

152
00:11:21.422 --> 00:11:22.991
It will start tomorrow.

153
00:11:24.022 --> 00:11:25.091
Tomorrow?

154
00:11:26.762 --> 00:11:27.762
Okay.

155
00:11:32.501 --> 00:11:34.772
(Guseonwon)

156
00:11:36.042 --> 00:11:37.542
Apostle Kang.

157
00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:41.512
I should go outside tonight because of a family affair.

158
00:11:43.012 --> 00:11:44.451
What family affair?

159
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:46.881
It's my mom's birthday today.

160
00:11:50.282 --> 00:11:54.721
The evil can disguise itself as your family and tempt you.

161
00:11:56.522 --> 00:11:57.522
I know.

162
00:11:58.831 --> 00:12:01.532
You need to assist Spiritual Mother, so come back before...

163
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:03.562
the morning worship.

164
00:12:03.902 --> 00:12:06.172
Okay. Our wishes will be fulfilled.

165
00:12:13.072 --> 00:12:16.581
Gosh, it's nice to have many young people.

166
00:12:16.912 --> 00:12:20.912
I wish my grandson would come to Guseonwon like you.

167
00:12:20.912 --> 00:12:23.081
Is he still the same?

168
00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:26.052
He wanted to be a soccer player when he was going to the church.

169
00:12:26.052 --> 00:12:27.451
Don't get me started.

170
00:12:27.451 --> 00:12:30.822
He's completely possessed by the evil computer.

171
00:12:30.822 --> 00:12:32.861
Gosh, Almighty.

172
00:12:33.991 --> 00:12:38.601
It sounds like you two went to a different church together.

173
00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:43.142
That's right. We went to the same church for 30 years...

174
00:12:43.142 --> 00:12:45.611
and left that place to come here.

175
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:48.782
That means... How should I say it?

176
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:52.152
We're the living proof.

177
00:12:52.152 --> 00:12:53.552
I see.

178
00:12:53.552 --> 00:12:56.282
After leaving your church,

179
00:12:56.282 --> 00:12:57.721
why did you come here?

180
00:12:57.721 --> 00:13:02.692
Spiritual Father's sermon is different from other pastors.

181
00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:06.131
He's gifted, so other people are jealous of him.

182
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:08.902
That's why they made up a false rumor.

183
00:13:09.432 --> 00:13:10.532
What rumor?

184
00:13:10.532 --> 00:13:13.231
They say Spiritual Father did something to a girl...

185
00:13:13.231 --> 00:13:16.142
Goodness, have you gone senile?

186
00:13:16.142 --> 00:13:19.111
Why are you saying things the demons would say?

187
00:13:19.371 --> 00:13:23.142
Stop it because it's bad for the new believers.

188
00:13:23.942 --> 00:13:28.121
People are always jealous of the person who is better than them.

189
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:30.282
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

190
00:13:30.322 --> 00:13:34.292
They're all demons' doings.

191
00:13:46.032 --> 00:13:47.672
- Thank you. - Are you getting off here?

192
00:13:48.841 --> 00:13:50.971
- Get home safely. - All right. Bye.

193
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:15.831
Thank you.

194
00:14:28.132 --> 00:14:31.172
- Are you looking for someone? - Is there a guy who's here alone?

195
00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:34.311
He's been drinking beer for two hours.

196
00:14:34.311 --> 00:14:35.571
Hey.

197
00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:37.512
Ma'am, I'd like a draft beer, please.

198
00:14:37.941 --> 00:14:39.912
What? Ma'am?

199
00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:43.851
What is wrong with her? She's probably only a few years my junior.

200
00:14:44.721 --> 00:14:46.782
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long.

201
00:14:46.782 --> 00:14:48.622
Gosh, who do you think you are?

202
00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:50.752
I can't believe you're bossing me around like this.

203
00:14:50.752 --> 00:14:54.061
Go easy on me, please. It was so hard for me to leave that place.

204
00:14:56.392 --> 00:14:57.662
Did you look into it?

205
00:15:00.802 --> 00:15:01.831
Here.

206
00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:08.172
It must be prescribed by a physician.

207
00:15:08.311 --> 00:15:11.341
When given every day, even normal people will become stupid.

208
00:15:11.441 --> 00:15:14.211
Are you sure they're giving it to people there?

209
00:15:14.552 --> 00:15:16.052
It's not like this is some vitamins.

210
00:15:16.811 --> 00:15:18.522
I'm not too sure yet,

211
00:15:18.782 --> 00:15:21.091
but I think they're giving it to more than one patient.

212
00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:23.821
I think you really need to get out of there now.

213
00:15:24.052 --> 00:15:26.961
Request an interview, and send the evidence to the police...

214
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:27.961
No.

215
00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:30.231
- Why not? - This isn't enough.

216
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:31.931
I'm sure they already bribed the doctor.

217
00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:35.331
Even if they get caught, they'll probably be able to get out of it.

218
00:15:35.431 --> 00:15:39.071
So Rin, are you being this risky because you want to move to Seoul?

219
00:15:40.912 --> 00:15:42.341
This is just my hunch,

220
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:43.872
but I don't think it's a simple alliance...

221
00:15:43.872 --> 00:15:45.912
between a religion and the political circle.

222
00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:49.012
- Then what is it? - Muji will be thrown upside down.

223
00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:53.152
Actually, it may affect the entire country.

224
00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:58.721
Drink up, ma'am.

225
00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:00.122
Sorry?

226
00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:05.131
Sang Mi is on the second floor of this main building,

227
00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:07.432
and her mom is...

228
00:16:07.732 --> 00:16:11.141
on the fifth floor of the sanitarium. It's tense there too.

229
00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:13.401
Gosh, it's literally surrounded by the mountains.

230
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:15.811
No one will even know even if someone dies.

231
00:16:15.972 --> 00:16:18.012
And have a look at this.

232
00:16:19.242 --> 00:16:21.381
This route through the mountains...

233
00:16:21.611 --> 00:16:23.381
is the quickest way downtown.

234
00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:24.851
Can we just leave through the main entrance?

235
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:27.692
Many people walk in and out of there throughout the day,

236
00:16:27.792 --> 00:16:29.022
so it's a bit dangerous.

237
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:30.621
Give it to me.

238
00:16:32.522 --> 00:16:36.262
If we're using a car and motorcycles,

239
00:16:36.492 --> 00:16:39.101
this route will be the quickest.

240
00:16:41.732 --> 00:16:42.932
Dong Cheol.

241
00:16:44.131 --> 00:16:46.772
Is Sang Mi doing well?

242
00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:49.512
Hey, what kind of question is that? How can she be doing well?

243
00:16:49.512 --> 00:16:52.182
All right. "Dong Cheol, Sang Mi must doing horrible there."

244
00:16:52.182 --> 00:16:53.982
Was I supposed to ask like that instead?

245
00:16:54.952 --> 00:16:57.411
Regular believers can't really meet her,

246
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:59.482
so I haven't had a chance to talk to her,

247
00:17:00.222 --> 00:17:02.921
but it looks like she's staying strong.

248
00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:07.421
I decided to live there with them for the next little while.

249
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:10.161
What?

250
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:15.131
Hey, are you out of your mind? Why would you do that?

251
00:17:15.131 --> 00:17:16.432
We don't have much time.

252
00:17:16.432 --> 00:17:18.772
Dong Cheol, I'm worried that something might happen to you.

253
00:17:18.772 --> 00:17:20.601
Just tell them you're too tired, and sleep at home.

254
00:17:20.871 --> 00:17:22.911
I agree. Going in too deep...

255
00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:24.811
might expose you to more danger.

256
00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:28.752
We should do everything we can.

257
00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:31.982
They're asking 2,000 dollars from newbies and making them stay there,

258
00:17:31.982 --> 00:17:34.391
saying that it's part of their training program.

259
00:17:34.391 --> 00:17:37.921
2,000 dollars is a lot. Do you even have that much money?

260
00:17:44.432 --> 00:17:46.462
All right. I'll see what I can do.

261
00:17:47.772 --> 00:17:50.472
Well, we should give Jung Hoon some credit for what he found out today.

262
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:56.012
Gosh, you didn't have to bring that up. You're making me blush.

263
00:17:56.911 --> 00:18:00.611
I found out where they were before coming to Muji.

264
00:18:00.911 --> 00:18:02.151
Where were they?

265
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:03.682
Near Daegu.

266
00:18:03.851 --> 00:18:07.081
I'm going to go there and check it out. I should be able to find...

267
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:09.792
some clues to figure out what they did there and who they are.

268
00:18:10.391 --> 00:18:12.861
Oh, I think the leader used to be a pastor.

269
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:14.732
- Pastor? - Yes.

270
00:18:14.732 --> 00:18:18.502
A few believers told me that they used to go to his church.

271
00:18:18.502 --> 00:18:21.371
They didn't get into details, but I think he had problems with women.

272
00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:25.101
This isn't his first time. I bet he's done this many times.

273
00:18:25.101 --> 00:18:28.242
By any chance, did they tell you the name of the church?

274
00:18:28.242 --> 00:18:30.371
No, that's all they told me.

275
00:18:32.182 --> 00:18:35.111
All right. I might be able to find the church when I'm there.

276
00:18:35.111 --> 00:18:39.321
Oh, I heard that a detective from Muji Police Station came by.

277
00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:42.722
Apparently, he spoke with the leader and even saw Sang Mi.

278
00:18:42.722 --> 00:18:44.421
What? Hey.

279
00:18:44.522 --> 00:18:47.861
He didn't believe a word we said. What changed his mind?

280
00:18:47.861 --> 00:18:49.631
I wonder what he and Sang Mi talked about.

281
00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:54.932
I should look into it.

282
00:18:58.702 --> 00:19:01.671
Dad, are you still sleeping?

283
00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:05.542
Is he not home yet?

284
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:09.581
He's never done that before. What's gotten into him?

285
00:19:09.911 --> 00:19:12.351
I told you to make sure he doesn't drink today.

286
00:19:12.881 --> 00:19:14.722
Why are you blaming me?

287
00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.692
Dad.

288
00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:19.762
Dad.

289
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:23.091
Gosh, you should've just said that you're still in bed.

290
00:19:23.591 --> 00:19:24.802
Dad.

291
00:19:25.732 --> 00:19:28.401
Dad. Dad!

292
00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:33.942
What's wrong with him?

293
00:19:35.972 --> 00:19:38.081
I think he's dead.

294
00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:42.782
The land registry documents should be okay, right?

295
00:19:55.962 --> 00:19:57.032
They're gone.

296
00:19:57.032 --> 00:19:58.131
That can't be.

297
00:19:58.802 --> 00:20:02.401
Does that mean he gave them our house registry papers too?

298
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:07.341
That con artist. I'll kill you today.

299
00:20:08.171 --> 00:20:10.341
Please don't do this. You cannot go in.

300
00:20:10.341 --> 00:20:12.012
- You can't do this. - Let go of me!

301
00:20:12.482 --> 00:20:13.581
Please don't do this.

302
00:20:14.042 --> 00:20:16.252
Are you the pastor here?

303
00:20:16.252 --> 00:20:18.151
Yes, it's that man. I've seen him.

304
00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:20.081
Please calm down.

305
00:20:20.081 --> 00:20:21.851
How can we help you?

306
00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:24.391
You want to know why I'm here? You crook.

307
00:20:24.692 --> 00:20:27.361
Do you even know how much money my dad has donated to this place?

308
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:30.901
How dare you steal our house and land registry papers too?

309
00:20:30.962 --> 00:20:33.002
You guys are complete trash.

310
00:20:33.002 --> 00:20:35.571
Please calm down. It looks like there was a misunderstanding.

311
00:20:35.571 --> 00:20:37.002
Misunderstanding, my foot!

312
00:20:37.331 --> 00:20:39.101
Where is your father?

313
00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:42.571
He didn't come to the service this morning.

314
00:20:43.212 --> 00:20:44.682
I'll visit him at home.

315
00:20:44.682 --> 00:20:48.381
You'll visit him? He passed away this morning!

316
00:20:48.381 --> 00:20:50.512
- What? - You can't cause a scene here.

317
00:20:50.512 --> 00:20:51.752
- Gosh! - My goodness!

318
00:20:52.482 --> 00:20:53.752
Congratulations.

319
00:20:54.722 --> 00:20:57.821
Your father finally got on the Boat of Salvation.

320
00:20:58.921 --> 00:21:01.192
Everyone, do you believe that Brother Yoon...

321
00:21:01.192 --> 00:21:03.091
has ascended to the paradise?

322
00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:04.861
- We believe it! - We believe it!

323
00:21:04.861 --> 00:21:07.331
My gosh, Almighty has shown us his loving kindness.

324
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:08.502
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

325
00:21:08.502 --> 00:21:12.401
I should pray hard so that I can get on the Boat of Salvation too.

326
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:14.242
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

327
00:21:14.371 --> 00:21:17.071
- Congratulations. - My gosh, congratulations.

328
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.921
Don't be sad.

329
00:21:28.552 --> 00:21:30.052
Don't be angry.

330
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:34.121
And please let him go.

331
00:21:35.061 --> 00:21:37.032
He chose it for your sake,

332
00:21:37.932 --> 00:21:42.601
not because he wanted to go to the paradise alone.

333
00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:47.942
He loved you...

334
00:21:49.111 --> 00:21:51.911
more than his own son.

335
00:21:54.351 --> 00:21:55.952
How do you know that?

336
00:21:56.351 --> 00:21:58.552
Honey, what is he saying?

337
00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:07.022
Apostle Jo.

338
00:22:07.631 --> 00:22:08.732
Yes.

339
00:22:10.591 --> 00:22:12.502
Has his father ever...

340
00:22:12.502 --> 00:22:15.802
brought such documents as a donation to us?

341
00:22:18.242 --> 00:22:21.442
Apostle Jo, please make sure...

342
00:22:21.742 --> 00:22:23.512
Spiritual Father gets this.

343
00:22:25.682 --> 00:22:29.282
Yes. He said he wanted to donate them as a special offering.

344
00:22:29.311 --> 00:22:30.952
Give it back to him.

345
00:22:31.682 --> 00:22:32.782
I'm sorry?

346
00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:37.861
His father is already in the paradise.

347
00:22:37.861 --> 00:22:38.891
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

348
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:43.561
- I believe it. - I believe it.

349
00:22:43.561 --> 00:22:46.101
His special offering...

350
00:22:46.661 --> 00:22:49.772
does not mean anything now.

351
00:22:52.141 --> 00:22:53.401
Spiritual Father.

352
00:22:54.571 --> 00:22:57.371
How can you be so sure that his father...

353
00:22:57.512 --> 00:22:59.682
went to the paradise?

354
00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:08.692
Apostle Jo.

355
00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:14.331
My words are the words of Almighty.

356
00:23:15.792 --> 00:23:17.192
Do you doubt that?

357
00:23:21.202 --> 00:23:23.532
Do I doubt that? Of course not.

358
00:23:24.242 --> 00:23:25.401
I believe it.

359
00:23:25.401 --> 00:23:27.442
Our wishes will be fulfilled!

360
00:23:27.442 --> 00:23:29.671
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - I believe it.

361
00:23:29.671 --> 00:23:30.911
- I believe it. - I believe it.

(Muji Church)

363
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:54.601
Gosh.

364
00:23:55.272 --> 00:23:56.272
Hello.

365
00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:57.502
He's over there.

366
00:23:59.202 --> 00:24:02.442
He's been there like that since this morning. Take him, please.

367
00:24:04.542 --> 00:24:07.682
Goodness, he stinks.

368
00:24:08.881 --> 00:24:11.252
Sir, please wake up.

369
00:24:11.252 --> 00:24:13.321
You shouldn't be lying down on the ground like this.

370
00:24:13.321 --> 00:24:16.391
We'll take you to a more comfortable place.

371
00:24:16.391 --> 00:24:19.992
Please get up. Goodness.

372
00:24:21.061 --> 00:24:24.502
Gosh, what in the world did you eat?

373
00:24:39.542 --> 00:24:40.581
Hi, Sergeant Woo.

374
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:41.782
How have you been?

375
00:24:41.782 --> 00:24:44.351
Great. Thank you for your hard work at this late hour.

376
00:24:45.182 --> 00:24:46.982
- Please wait. - Okay.

377
00:24:54.492 --> 00:24:56.232
- Get off. - Where am I?

378
00:24:56.232 --> 00:24:57.391
Come on.

379
00:24:57.391 --> 00:24:59.432
- Where is this place? Wait. - Gosh.

380
00:24:59.432 --> 00:25:01.901
Come on. My gosh.

381
00:25:01.901 --> 00:25:03.502
What is this place?

382
00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:05.901
- He's still a little drunk. - Where am I?

383
00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:08.611
Let go of me. I don't want to go.

384
00:25:08.611 --> 00:25:11.381
Please take good care of him.

385
00:25:11.381 --> 00:25:13.341
Don't worry about anything.

386
00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:16.012
He will find salvation and have a new life here.

387
00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:18.752
- I'll be going then. - Wait, Sergeant Woo.

388
00:25:19.621 --> 00:25:21.952
Goodness, you don't have to.

389
00:25:22.091 --> 00:25:25.121
You need to stay healthy so that you can support...

390
00:25:25.121 --> 00:25:26.891
your wife and son. Am I right?

391
00:25:26.891 --> 00:25:30.091
I shouldn't keep accepting these things from you.

392
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:33.962
Don't worry. Nobody knows.

393
00:26:03.661 --> 00:26:04.732
All right.

394
00:26:05.702 --> 00:26:07.901
I should pay for Jung Hoon's college tuition...

395
00:26:07.901 --> 00:26:10.841
and buy him a house when he gets married as his dad.

396
00:26:14.671 --> 00:26:16.972
(Muji Police Station)

397
00:26:22.552 --> 00:26:23.682
What are you doing here?

398
00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:27.222
I know that it's troublesome and difficult for the police...

399
00:26:27.222 --> 00:26:29.492
to investigate a religious group.

400
00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:33.262
I'm also aware that...

401
00:26:33.262 --> 00:26:36.131
they won't obediently agree...

402
00:26:36.131 --> 00:26:38.762
to go through the investigation.

403
00:26:49.671 --> 00:26:50.942
Get up now.

404
00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:52.242
You just said you know all that.

405
00:26:52.242 --> 00:26:55.982
I do know, but please don't tell me...

406
00:26:56.282 --> 00:26:58.452
to stay quiet and do nothing.

407
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:02.722
If it was your daughter who was taken by swindlers,

408
00:27:02.722 --> 00:27:05.821
would you still tell me to do nothing?

409
00:27:06.462 --> 00:27:09.232
People are looking at us suspiciously because of you.

410
00:27:09.831 --> 00:27:11.532
Why are you doing this to me?

411
00:27:12.462 --> 00:27:13.462
Frankly, I...

412
00:27:14.331 --> 00:27:16.502
hate you.

413
00:27:17.032 --> 00:27:18.042
I don't trust you either.

414
00:27:18.371 --> 00:27:20.202
You did the same thing to Dong Cheol,

415
00:27:20.202 --> 00:27:24.442
and you also sent Sang Mi back to that place.

416
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:28.311
But I need you now.

417
00:27:28.512 --> 00:27:33.052
I really need a chief detective who can...

418
00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:36.391
investigate Guseonwon.

419
00:27:39.192 --> 00:27:40.621
Look.

420
00:27:41.091 --> 00:27:43.492
I'm not interested.

421
00:27:43.692 --> 00:27:46.262
So you can either go back now,

422
00:27:46.262 --> 00:27:49.502
or stay here like this. Do as you like.

423
00:27:50.571 --> 00:27:52.002
When you went to Guseonwon,

424
00:27:53.772 --> 00:27:55.411
why did you meet Sang Mi?

425
00:27:55.772 --> 00:27:57.341
You know that...

426
00:27:57.811 --> 00:28:01.411
what Sang Mi told you isn't true.

427
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:04.851
- So? - I will...

428
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:09.321
give you information that you'd be interested in.

429
00:28:14.232 --> 00:28:17.732
Fine, get up. Get up now, you brat.

430
00:28:19.002 --> 00:28:20.101
Okay then.

431
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:23.831
Please come with me.

432
00:28:23.901 --> 00:28:24.942
What?

433
00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:29.171
I thought we were doing this. Aren't you coming?

434
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:31.012
Where? Hey.

435
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:34.381
That crazy punk. He's insane.

436
00:28:35.081 --> 00:28:36.381
Hey.

437
00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:39.151
I'm not going anywhere.

438
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:41.692
Don't you want to check the information?

439
00:28:41.692 --> 00:28:42.921
Are you kidding me?

440
00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:46.192
I don't know what you're going to do. Why would I follow you?

441
00:28:47.391 --> 00:28:51.232
It's about Kim Hae Eun, the woman who went missing and died,

442
00:28:51.232 --> 00:28:53.561
and the one you're investigating on now.

443
00:28:53.561 --> 00:28:56.472
As far as I know, she often argued with her grandmother...

444
00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:59.841
because she asked for 2,000 dollars to go to the paradise.

445
00:29:01.272 --> 00:29:02.311
How did you know that?

446
00:29:02.311 --> 00:29:05.841
Muji is a much smaller place than you think.

447
00:29:06.982 --> 00:29:10.182
You've found a dead body. It's natural that rumors spread.

448
00:29:10.752 --> 00:29:14.752
In order for believers to face Spiritual Father in Guseonwon,

449
00:29:14.752 --> 00:29:17.591
they have to complete the basic spiritual training first.

450
00:29:17.591 --> 00:29:20.161
They need 2,000 dollars to take that training.

451
00:29:20.831 --> 00:29:24.091
She said she must go to the paradise or something.

452
00:29:24.161 --> 00:29:27.532
She begged me to lend her 2,000 dollars.

453
00:29:29.532 --> 00:29:32.002
How do you know so much about Guseonwon?

454
00:29:32.542 --> 00:29:33.901
I'll tell you as we go.

455
00:29:37.371 --> 00:29:39.012
That brat.

456
00:29:42.651 --> 00:29:44.682
It will remove the toxin in your body.

457
00:29:45.121 --> 00:29:46.581
You have to drink all of it.

That's the rotten mass of sin...

00:30:19.581 --> 00:30:21.492
that has been inside of you.

461
00:30:22.552 --> 00:30:24.091
Cough up all of it.

what you want, Apostle Kang?

00:30:37.432 --> 00:30:39.302
Is this what you want, Mom?

465
00:30:39.401 --> 00:30:42.371
It's something he wants, not you.

There will be a real estate agency if we turn left at the intersection.

He says it's near there.

Aren't you going to go?

475
00:31:28.492 --> 00:31:29.851
Do you want to become a detective?

No.

479
00:31:38.002 --> 00:31:39.232
You're being a little rude.

480
00:31:40.831 --> 00:31:42.101
Me?

481
00:31:42.371 --> 00:31:43.601
Just wear your seatbelt.

Please come in.

485
00:32:00.682 --> 00:32:02.452
It's definitely a cult.

486
00:32:05.962 --> 00:32:09.932
Is it okay to record our conversation?

487
00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:12.262
Well, sure.

488
00:32:17.742 --> 00:32:22.071
It's true that this man worked here as a pastor before, right?

489
00:32:22.542 --> 00:32:24.111
Yes, it's true.

490
00:32:24.111 --> 00:32:26.811
To think of that time... My goodness.

491
00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:29.952
Did he do anything else other than embezzle the church's money?

492
00:32:29.952 --> 00:32:31.222
It was fake.

493
00:32:31.921 --> 00:32:34.292
- What was fake? - After some investigation,

494
00:32:34.292 --> 00:32:37.621
we found out that his certificate of ordination was fake.

495

He's such an eloquent speaker.

00:32:39.762 --> 00:32:42.432
So we got fooled by what he said.

497
00:32:43.192 --> 00:32:45.302
By the way, did he ever...

498
00:32:45.302 --> 00:32:47.502
sexually molest female believers?

499
00:32:49.171 --> 00:32:51.502
We already heard about it before coming here.

500
00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:53.071
So please don't hide anything, and tell us.

501
00:32:55.212 --> 00:32:58.282
Don't you think we should get rid of all religious cults?

502
00:32:59.881 --> 00:33:03.252
Well, there was one believer who was...

503
00:33:03.252 --> 00:33:05.581
particularly close with him.

504
00:33:05.952 --> 00:33:10.191
And apparently, they were in a special relationship.

505
00:33:10.291 --> 00:33:12.361
- Am I right? - Yes.

506
00:33:12.492 --> 00:33:15.432
There was a pretty-looking apostle whose job was a nurse.

507
00:33:15.562 --> 00:33:17.131
And whenever her husband drank...

508
00:33:17.731 --> 00:33:20.102
Whenever he got drunk, he would beat her.

509
00:33:20.102 --> 00:33:22.001
So they must've grown close to each other...

510
00:33:22.001 --> 00:33:24.102
as he prayed for her and listened to her hardships.

511
00:33:24.642 --> 00:33:27.041
Do you remember her name?

512
00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:30.812
I just remember her as Apostle Kang.

513
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:33.041
Do you remember how she looked?

514
00:33:33.041 --> 00:33:34.452
She was pretty.

515
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:37.052
She had big eyes and plump lips.

516
00:33:37.182 --> 00:33:39.452
She seems cold-hearted from the outside.

517
00:33:39.622 --> 00:33:42.392
But she looks really nice when she smiles.

518
00:33:42.492 --> 00:33:43.821
I don't know why...

519
00:33:44.762 --> 00:33:46.961
she had to get involved with a guy like that.

520
00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:50.291
Then do you know a guy who's always with him?

521
00:33:50.492 --> 00:33:54.472
He has long eyes, and he has a perm like a middle-aged woman.

522
00:33:54.872 --> 00:33:59.102
Oh, it seems like you're talking about Apostle Jo.

523
00:33:59.102 --> 00:34:00.372
Yes, he is.

524
00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:03.571
He came with that pastor ever since he started serving here.

525
00:34:04.412 --> 00:34:06.082
And there was also a big guy...

526
00:34:06.082 --> 00:34:08.452
who couldn't talk. From what I know, he was his stepbrother.

527
00:34:08.582 --> 00:34:10.512
They were all so friendly.

528
00:34:10.512 --> 00:34:13.282
So they had everyone on their side in no time.

529
00:34:13.282 --> 00:34:15.392
They were so influential.

530
00:34:15.552 --> 00:34:18.821
After I started serving here, I examined our church's accounts.

531
00:34:18.992 --> 00:34:21.191
And I found out that our church had ended up with a huge amount of debt.

532
00:34:21.191 --> 00:34:24.832
He even took out a private loan, so that already explains everything.

533
00:34:33.841 --> 00:34:35.671
Are you still going to tell me to stand still?

534
00:34:35.972 --> 00:34:38.111
Give me some time to think.

535
00:34:38.642 --> 00:34:41.751
I can't stand still. No, I won't stand still.

536
00:34:42.552 --> 00:34:45.321
My friend's going to broadcast the conversation we just had.

537
00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:48.892
What? What are you talking about?

538
00:34:48.892 --> 00:34:50.992
We also have a plan of our own.

539
00:34:52.421 --> 00:34:53.492
My gosh.

540
00:34:55.631 --> 00:34:57.392
You said you sent your friend there, right?

541
00:34:58.001 --> 00:34:59.001
Yes.

542
00:34:59.532 --> 00:35:01.102
Then ask him to find out the name of the old woman...

543
00:35:01.102 --> 00:35:03.432
who followed that cult leader to Guseonwon.

544
00:35:04.771 --> 00:35:05.872
Why?

545
00:35:05.872 --> 00:35:08.041
I first need to confirm the facts.

546
00:35:09.012 --> 00:35:10.441
Broadcast, my foot.

547
00:35:10.841 --> 00:35:12.742
Where in Muji will you be able to broadcast this?

548
00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:18.981
My gosh. Ma'am.

549
00:35:19.381 --> 00:35:21.691
It must be heavy. I'll carry that for you.

550
00:35:21.691 --> 00:35:24.222
My goodness. Thank you.

551
00:35:25.062 --> 00:35:27.731
May our Almighty bless you.

552
00:35:30.262 --> 00:35:31.332
Drink some water.

553
00:35:31.702 --> 00:35:33.832
- Thank you. - Gosh, it's hot.

554
00:35:37.541 --> 00:35:39.541
The water tastes so nice.

555
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:42.571
It's because this water is from a spring...

556
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:45.682
that was blessed by our Spiritual Father's prayers.

557
00:35:46.012 --> 00:35:49.282
By the way, what's your name?

558
00:35:49.412 --> 00:35:50.751
My name?

559
00:35:51.122 --> 00:35:53.552
Why would you want to know an old woman's name?

560
00:35:54.821 --> 00:35:58.521
You remind me of my late grandmother.

561
00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:02.461
My name is Park Soon Nyeo.

562
00:36:04.961 --> 00:36:06.532
Your name is very pretty.

563
00:36:06.832 --> 00:36:10.571
From now on, you should also pray diligently.

564
00:36:10.571 --> 00:36:15.211
Then you'll be able to meet your grandmother in paradise.

565
00:36:15.211 --> 00:36:16.512
Okay?

566
00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:18.481
Okay.

567
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:21.151
Good.

568
00:36:24.381 --> 00:36:26.521
(Park Soon Nyeo)

569
00:36:52.282 --> 00:36:53.541
You should lie down.

570
00:37:04.992 --> 00:37:07.021
I checked with my colleague at work.

571
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:09.591
And it turns out that the pill...

572
00:37:09.591 --> 00:37:11.932
they've been giving to your mother was a psychotropic drug.

573
00:37:12.302 --> 00:37:15.671
We just need to find proof to show that it was also given to others.

574
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:18.001
Then the police and prosecution...

575
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:20.171
won't be able to stay quiet.

576
00:37:22.142 --> 00:37:23.642
So please hang in there.

577
00:37:24.582 --> 00:37:28.182
I need to go now. Apostle Kang told me to come see her.

578
00:37:30.182 --> 00:37:31.352
Wait.

579
00:37:35.291 --> 00:37:37.992
I have one more favor to ask of you.

580
00:37:49.032 --> 00:37:50.472
Please give this...

581
00:37:51.441 --> 00:37:54.071
to Dong Cheol.

582
00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:24.702
Sang Jin.

583

Mom.

584
00:38:29.671 --> 00:38:32.041
I'm slowly starting to see hope.

585
00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:36.812
I thought nobody would ever listen to me.

586
00:38:37.312 --> 00:38:38.751
But people are...

587
00:38:40.321 --> 00:38:42.852
slowly starting to listen.

588
00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:47.932
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

589
00:38:47.932 --> 00:38:49.091
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

590
00:38:51.901 --> 00:38:53.062
Honey.

591
00:38:54.202 --> 00:38:55.702
About Sang Mi...

592
00:38:59.841 --> 00:39:01.271
Don't worry.

593
00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:08.211
Sang Mi...

594
00:39:09.052 --> 00:39:13.082
will soon get married to Spiritual Father.

595
00:39:14.992 --> 00:39:16.151
Honey.

596
00:39:18.492 --> 00:39:19.622
I'm...

597
00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:23.992
so grateful that we were able to come here.

598
00:39:24.162 --> 00:39:27.361
This was all a divine message of our Almighty.

599
00:39:28.472 --> 00:39:31.742
Everything happened so that he could bless Sang Mi to become...

600
00:39:32.401 --> 00:39:34.271
the Spiritual Mother.

601
00:39:35.812 --> 00:39:37.441
Isn't it amazing?

602
00:39:38.782 --> 00:39:40.111
We're almost there.

603

Sister So Rin.

604
00:39:48.622 --> 00:39:49.892
Yes?

605
00:39:50.091 --> 00:39:53.791
Did you give Living Water to our soon-to-be Spiritual Mother?

606
00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:55.562
Yes.

607
00:39:56.992 --> 00:39:59.361
Are you happy with your current duty?

608
00:39:59.961 --> 00:40:03.071
Yes, I'm very grateful towards our Almighty.

609
00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:07.102
What did you say your job was...

610
00:40:07.512 --> 00:40:09.541
before you came to Guseonwon?

611
00:40:11.481 --> 00:40:13.742
I was getting ready to go to graduate school.

612
00:40:13.812 --> 00:40:17.182
But then, I met our Almighty and realized my path.

613
00:40:19.082 --> 00:40:20.282
I see.

614
00:40:21.291 --> 00:40:23.321
Okay. You can go do your work.

617
00:41:09.302 --> 00:41:11.341
- We're the police. - Pardon?

618
00:41:20.642 --> 00:41:24.622
All this land used to belong to Park Soon Nyeo.

619
00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:29.821
Does that mean this land doesn't belong to her anymore?

620
00:41:29.821 --> 00:41:31.091
It was planned to go under reconstruction,

621
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:32.321
so she sold it a few years ago.

622
00:41:32.722 --> 00:41:36.432
Then can you check who owns this land at the moment?

623
00:41:36.432 --> 00:41:38.302
Yes, of course.

624
00:41:43.131 --> 00:41:46.071
Yes, I was right. The owner had changed.

625
00:41:46.441 --> 00:41:48.372
Does it belong to Baek Jung Ki?

626
00:41:48.642 --> 00:41:51.682
No. It belongs to Jo Wan Tae.

Don't you agree?

632

My gosh, he owns all this land.

00:42:39.492 --> 00:42:43.032
Pardon? Oh, his name was Lee Kang Su.

638

00:44:03.671 --> 00:44:05.341
What are you talking about?

662
00:44:05.341 --> 00:44:07.881
I'm really behaving myself these days.

663
00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:09.182
You little...

664
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:16.892
You obviously served time for violence.

665
00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:19.591
Who said you could talk to me like I'm your friend?

666
00:44:21.662 --> 00:44:24.731
Guys like you think everything's over once you get out of prison.

667
00:44:24.932 --> 00:44:27.671
But life's not that simple.

668
00:44:28.731 --> 00:44:31.041
I heard you became a prison guard for that Spiritual Father.

669
00:44:31.242 --> 00:44:33.202
So you must still think this place is prison.

670
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:35.642
Why are you acting up in my neighborhood?

671
00:44:35.642 --> 00:44:37.211
My gosh, stop it.

672
00:44:37.211 --> 00:44:38.711
Why are you guys doing this?

673
00:44:38.711 --> 00:44:39.941
You're cute.

674
00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:45.151
There's a place called Guseonwon. It only takes 20 minutes from town.

675
00:44:45.151 --> 00:44:48.052
It's a very nice church, so you should come visit.

676
00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:50.892
I'll help you clear all your sins.

677
00:44:51.222 --> 00:44:52.722
You should go to paradise.

678
00:44:54.062 --> 00:44:55.131
"Paradise"?

679
00:44:56.432 --> 00:44:58.702
"Guseonwon"? Wait a minute.

680
00:44:58.702 --> 00:45:00.501
Oh, yes. I remember now.

681
00:45:00.662 --> 00:45:03.171
That place is being broadcasted on the internet these days.

682
00:45:03.302 --> 00:45:04.901
Is that where you work?

683
00:45:07.041 --> 00:45:08.941
What do you mean?

684
00:45:15.711 --> 00:45:17.282
(Please report to us.)

685
00:45:26.492 --> 00:45:28.532
(Please report to us.)

686
00:45:28.532 --> 00:45:29.562
(Send a memo.)

687
00:45:29.562 --> 00:45:30.631
Okay.

688
00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:34.771
So you're waiting for reports, are you?

689
00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:40.642
Are you the informant?

690
00:45:40.642 --> 00:45:43.041
Yes, yes. Thank you.

691
00:45:44.142 --> 00:45:48.881
Oh, you used to go to a church in Daegu that just got broadcasted?

692
00:45:49.251 --> 00:45:51.981
Gosh, no wonder. That must be why you called.

693
00:45:51.981 --> 00:45:53.582
Oh, I see.

694
00:45:54.321 --> 00:45:55.452
There's more?

695
00:45:58.191 --> 00:45:59.222
Let's go.

696
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:44.001
(Almsgiving: Almighty, please prevent my son from getting sick.)

697
00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:48.071
(Almsgiving: Almighty, please help my son stay healthy)

698
00:46:48.071 --> 00:46:49.242
(Almsgiving: Almighty, please help me and my son go to paradise.)

699
00:46:58.722 --> 00:47:02.251
My gosh, why are you drinking soju by itself?

700
00:47:02.892 --> 00:47:03.952
What's wrong?

701
00:47:04.691 --> 00:47:06.021
Did you quit work?

702
00:47:09.562 --> 00:47:12.501
You should eat something with it. You'll hurt your stomach.

703
00:47:13.032 --> 00:47:16.202
If you're going to keep doing this, let's just die.

704
00:47:17.941 --> 00:47:19.041
What?

705
00:47:19.041 --> 00:47:20.972
Do you think this world will even...

706
00:47:21.211 --> 00:47:24.312
have a place for a guy like me who got expelled for fighting?

707
00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.052
No, you're wrong.

708
00:47:30.852 --> 00:47:33.251
Dae Sik, there's a way.

709
00:47:34.622 --> 00:47:35.751
It's Guseonwon.

710
00:47:37.562 --> 00:47:38.992
Have you gone mad?

711
00:47:41.961 --> 00:47:44.802
Was it not enough for you to spend...

712
00:47:44.802 --> 00:47:47.001
all your money on this place?

713
00:47:47.001 --> 00:47:48.602
Did you even take out a private loan?

714
00:47:48.602 --> 00:47:51.041
No, that's not it.

715
00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:53.901
Things like money only make our souls suffer.

716
00:47:53.901 --> 00:47:55.912
Money is evil.

717
00:47:55.912 --> 00:47:57.041
Please...

718
00:47:58.012 --> 00:48:00.211
Please stop saying that.

719
00:48:00.952 --> 00:48:04.321
Every time you say stuff like that, I feel like I'm going to go crazy.

720
00:48:05.021 --> 00:48:06.021
My gosh.

721
00:48:13.821 --> 00:48:14.832
What's wrong?

722
00:48:14.832 --> 00:48:16.662
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

723
00:48:17.332 --> 00:48:20.702
My goodness. Gosh, my leg.

724
00:48:20.702 --> 00:48:21.832
What's wrong?

725
00:48:22.602 --> 00:48:23.832
It's nothing.

726
00:48:25.771 --> 00:48:27.271
Did someone hit you?

727
00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:29.771
No, no one hit me.

728
00:48:30.312 --> 00:48:31.782
Was it those loan sharks?

729
00:48:31.782 --> 00:48:33.812
No, it wasn't them.

730
00:48:33.812 --> 00:48:35.552
Then who hit you?

731
00:48:36.912 --> 00:48:40.251
Dae Sik, I didn't get these bruises because someone hit me.

732
00:48:40.921 --> 00:48:43.151
I got these from fire prayers.

733
00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:46.821
And they're not bruises. They're signs of sin.

734
00:48:47.832 --> 00:48:50.832
I've committed so many sins.

735
00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:53.262
That's why I get these kind of bruises on my body.

736
00:49:02.142 --> 00:49:03.372
No one beat me.

737
00:49:03.441 --> 00:49:06.041
Dae Sik. Where are you going?

738
00:49:06.082 --> 00:49:07.381
Dae Sik!

739
00:49:07.981 --> 00:49:11.381
Hey, Man Hee. I came to meet an informant.

740
00:49:11.552 --> 00:49:13.052
No, it's near my house.

741
00:49:13.052 --> 00:49:16.321
I'm going to sleep at my house tonight. I'll be there tomorrow.

742
00:49:16.791 --> 00:49:19.961
No, I can't. My dad will kill me if I don't go home today.

743
00:49:20.062 --> 00:49:21.992
Okay. Tell Sang Hwan for me.

744
00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:25.501
Okay, goodnight. I'll bring you big news tomorrow.

745
00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:26.861
Okay.

746
00:49:36.171 --> 00:49:39.512
Hello? Are you the informant?

747
00:49:44.821 --> 00:49:47.691
(Guseonwon)

748
00:50:04.702 --> 00:50:06.001
(To Sang Hwan)

749
00:50:15.211 --> 00:50:18.321
They've been feeding weird medicine to my mom.

750
00:50:18.622 --> 00:50:21.452
So Rin helped her stop taking that medicine,

751
00:50:21.452 --> 00:50:23.421
so her mind's slowly starting to come back to normal.

752
00:50:24.162 --> 00:50:26.791
If we find more evidence on that medicine,

753
00:50:26.791 --> 00:50:28.861
we might be able to release it to the press.

754
00:50:30.901 --> 00:50:32.401
And it wasn't the first time...

755
00:50:33.662 --> 00:50:36.671
that cult leader tried to make someone into a Spiritual Mother.

756
00:50:37.271 --> 00:50:39.771
I think he also raped someone in the past.

757
00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:41.711
I recorded everything regarding that.

758
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:43.872
You'll be able to find out about his sins...

759
00:50:43.872 --> 00:50:45.782
if you look into his past.

760
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:50.552
Then I think I'll be able to destroy this place...

761
00:50:51.082 --> 00:50:53.852
and be free to get out of here.

762
00:50:54.992 --> 00:50:57.052
You guys should also be careful until then.

763
00:51:02.361 --> 00:51:06.032
I visited the church that the old woman used to go to.

764
00:51:06.432 --> 00:51:08.631
And I've confirmed that she and her friends followed the cult leader.

765
00:51:08.872 --> 00:51:13.041
On top of that, he bought his certificate of ordination,

766
00:51:13.142 --> 00:51:14.611
embezzled church money,

767
00:51:14.611 --> 00:51:16.512
and had problems with a female believer.

768
00:51:19.611 --> 00:51:21.282
I finally get it now.

769
00:51:21.452 --> 00:51:24.751
I think we'll be able to get him soon, so wait for my contact.

770
00:51:26.122 --> 00:51:28.892
Then we'll try to think of your escape route...

771
00:51:28.892 --> 00:51:31.162
with the information you gave us.

772
00:52:51.642 --> 00:52:53.341
I bet you're now realizing...

773
00:52:53.972 --> 00:52:55.571
whom you guys were messing with.

774
00:52:59.211 --> 00:53:00.282
Who is it?

775
00:53:00.912 --> 00:53:03.182
What do you mean?

776
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:08.052
Who's the rat that's been snooping around with you?

777
00:53:08.091 --> 00:53:11.691
Well... I think you got the wrong idea.

778
00:53:11.921 --> 00:53:13.861
I work alone.

779
00:53:18.162 --> 00:53:20.901
I'll play with you later, okay?

780
00:53:49.656 --> 00:53:51.027
You startled me.

781
00:53:51.096 --> 00:53:52.726
Gosh, I almost jumped out of my skin.

782
00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:56.337
Dong Cheol, what brings you here?

783
00:53:57.766 --> 00:54:00.567
I couldn't fall asleep since it's my first night here,

784
00:54:00.567 --> 00:54:01.777
so I came out for a walk.

785
00:54:01.777 --> 00:54:04.136
I saw you and Brother Wan Deok...

786
00:54:04.136 --> 00:54:06.507
running into the forest,

787
00:54:06.547 --> 00:54:08.616
so I followed you because I was curious.

788
00:54:10.846 --> 00:54:14.317
Dong Cheol, it looks like you're a very curious person.

789
00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:17.487
My friends always tell me to stop being so nosy.

790
00:54:18.127 --> 00:54:21.596
Let me give you a piece of advice as I'm old enough to be your uncle.

791
00:54:21.726 --> 00:54:24.056
Doing your own thing like this isn't a good idea.

792
00:54:24.726 --> 00:54:26.027
Don't do this again, okay?

793
00:54:26.766 --> 00:54:30.567
The two of you seemed to be in such a big hurry,

794
00:54:30.837 --> 00:54:34.607
so I was just worried. I wanted to see if I could help in any way.

795
00:54:35.377 --> 00:54:37.207
My gosh, it's getting late.

796
00:54:37.306 --> 00:54:39.446
- We should get back down. - Pardon?

797
00:54:40.806 --> 00:54:42.016
By the way,

798
00:54:42.877 --> 00:54:45.386
- where's Brother Wan Deok? - He already went back.

799
00:54:45.386 --> 00:54:47.647
- Already? - Yes. Let's go.

800
00:54:51.826 --> 00:54:52.987
What's the matter?

801
00:54:52.987 --> 00:54:56.027
Well, I think I just heard something.

802
00:55:03.067 --> 00:55:04.297
Was it a cat?

803
00:55:05.067 --> 00:55:06.237
Let's go.

804
00:55:14.817 --> 00:55:17.317
By the way, where is Jung Hoon?

805
00:55:17.317 --> 00:55:18.516
He said he's not coming today.

806
00:55:19.746 --> 00:55:23.817
They said the spiritual wedding would take place in 40 days, right?

807
00:55:24.056 --> 00:55:25.556
Has it been about 10 days now?

808
00:55:26.786 --> 00:55:27.897
40 days...

809
00:55:28.096 --> 00:55:30.857
They won't expedite it, right?

810
00:55:32.297 --> 00:55:34.766
- Let's hope that doesn't happen. - Are you saying they might do it?

811
00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:38.806
I'll wait for Almighty's message...

812
00:55:39.007 --> 00:55:42.076
to reschedule the date for the wedding.

813
00:55:43.806 --> 00:55:46.047
If he says that he received...

814
00:55:46.047 --> 00:55:49.346
a new revelation from Almighty, the 40 days...

815
00:55:50.676 --> 00:55:52.346
will probably no longer mean anything.

816
00:56:27.286 --> 00:56:28.417
Sang Mi.

817
00:56:29.587 --> 00:56:30.886
You're doing a good job, right?

818
00:56:32.156 --> 00:56:34.957
Your spiritual wedding is just around the corner,

819
00:56:35.257 --> 00:56:37.056
so you should clear your mind of all negative thoughts.

820
00:56:37.726 --> 00:56:39.397
You need a clean slate...

821
00:56:39.567 --> 00:56:41.437
in order to accept Almighty and Spiritual Father...

822
00:56:42.136 --> 00:56:44.636
with all of your heart.

823
00:56:48.176 --> 00:56:49.337
Dad.

824
00:56:51.277 --> 00:56:53.846
There's something I want to ask you.

825
00:56:55.217 --> 00:56:56.547
Sure, what is it?

826
00:56:57.616 --> 00:56:59.246
After the wedding,

827
00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:02.757
will I have to...

828
00:57:05.857 --> 00:57:07.687
sleep with Spiritual Father?

829
00:57:28.377 --> 00:57:29.476
Sang Mi.

830
00:57:29.877 --> 00:57:33.386
That's not what it's about. That's how he'll baptize you.

831
00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:34.757
Baptism for salvation.

832
00:57:35.156 --> 00:57:37.857
So, you don't need to worry about anything.

833
00:57:38.786 --> 00:57:41.087
What if I refuse to be baptized?

834
00:57:41.996 --> 00:57:44.156
What will happen to me?

835
00:57:50.897 --> 00:57:54.306
Sang Mi, why are you even thinking about these things?

836
00:57:54.406 --> 00:57:57.076
No more foolish thoughts. Just focus on praying instead.

837
00:57:57.507 --> 00:58:00.647
My daughter, you can do a good job, right?

838
00:58:07.786 --> 00:58:09.016
So in the end,

839
00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:13.286
I do have to give him my everything.

840
00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:19.426
That's the only way to really end this.

841
00:58:33.746 --> 00:58:34.817
Who are you?

842
00:58:34.817 --> 00:58:37.817
You jerks made my mom get all bruised,

843
00:58:38.516 --> 00:58:40.386
saying that you're giving her a prayer.

844
00:58:40.687 --> 00:58:42.257
You guys need to pay for what you did.

845
00:58:42.257 --> 00:58:43.257
Hey, stop...

846
00:58:50.596 --> 00:58:53.167
Are you crazy? Stop that immediately!

847
00:58:58.007 --> 00:58:59.207
Sang Mi.

848
00:58:59.667 --> 00:59:00.766
Get out of here.

849
00:59:01.707 --> 00:59:02.937
Dad.

850
00:59:03.636 --> 00:59:07.676
Don't worry. Almighty will protect me.

851
00:59:08.817 --> 00:59:09.877
All right.

852
00:59:10.946 --> 00:59:14.016
Let's see if he'll really protect you.

853
00:59:16.457 --> 00:59:18.386
We shall find out.

854
00:59:38.846 --> 00:59:41.446
(Save Me)

855
00:59:45.246 --> 00:59:47.846
He's here! I caught the rat!

856
00:59:48.556 --> 00:59:49.957
Hey, what are you doing now?

857
00:59:50.056 --> 00:59:52.627
He's here! Hurry up!

858
00:59:53.487 --> 00:59:54.656
Have you lost your mind?

859
00:59:55.926 --> 00:59:57.426
- He's over there. - Get him!

860
00:59:57.967 --> 00:59:59.897
You demons!

861
01:00:01.897 --> 01:00:03.937
- Gosh. - Guys, get him.
