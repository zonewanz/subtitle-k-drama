00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:10.280
(Episode 16)

4
00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:12.902
Why are you taking so many things?

5
00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.242
I need everything here.

6
00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:17.173
I'll read while I'm there.

7
00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.473
You'll just stay in your hotel room.

8
00:00:19.943 --> 00:00:21.912
You hate moving around.

9
00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:23.682
I'll call the cab.

10
00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:28.553
Are you expecting someone?

11
00:00:28.553 --> 00:00:29.623
No.

12
00:00:35.422 --> 00:00:36.492
Hyun Soo.

13
00:00:37.263 --> 00:00:38.263
Why?

14
00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:46.772
- Goodness. - What?

15
00:00:47.403 --> 00:00:48.503
Oh my gosh.

16
00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:49.602
What is this?

17
00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:53.373
Chef, come in!

18
00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:56.513
Hello.

19
00:00:57.143 --> 00:00:59.083
We're going on a trip today.

20
00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:01.183
I know. I came to help carry the luggage.

21
00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:03.253
The restaurant's not open today?

22
00:01:03.452 --> 00:01:04.753
We're closed until today.

23
00:01:04.923 --> 00:01:06.223
Is this the luggage?

24
00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:10.992
Yes.

25
00:01:11.632 --> 00:01:13.033
Oh wait. This too.

26
00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:17.872
The traffic will get bad soon, so hurry.

27
00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:19.132
Okay.

28
00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:30.512
Oh my gosh! What is this?

29
00:01:31.483 --> 00:01:32.712
What's wrong with you?

30
00:01:32.712 --> 00:01:34.483
I don't know. What's wrong with me?

31
00:01:34.483 --> 00:01:36.283
It's not even happening to me.

32
00:01:36.753 --> 00:01:38.352
This is unfair!

33
00:01:39.053 --> 00:01:40.152
Hyun Soo!

34
00:01:45.492 --> 00:01:48.733
She got on the 7:15 train at Yongsan Station,

35
00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:51.503
so she'll probably be eating lunch at Yeosu around noon.

36
00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:52.733
You're excited.

37
00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.673
I haven't been this excited in a while.

38
00:01:55.272 --> 00:01:57.372
Why am I getting excited over someone else's relationship?

39
00:01:59.173 --> 00:02:01.412
It's been a while since I've gone through that crazy love.

40
00:02:28.902 --> 00:02:31.913
Chef, can we play some music?

41
00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:33.113
Of course we can.

42
00:02:39.652 --> 00:02:42.282
Chef, can we turn off the music?

43
00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:43.953
Of course we can.

44
00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:49.793
What are you doing?

45
00:02:50.163 --> 00:02:53.163
What do you mean? I'm playing boyfriend-girlfriend.

46
00:02:53.293 --> 00:02:55.263
It's your business, but I'm so jealous.

47
00:02:55.263 --> 00:02:56.532
Hwangbo Kyung!

48
00:02:56.733 --> 00:02:58.703
Hyun Soo doesn't like it when you say things like that.

49
00:02:58.703 --> 00:03:00.233
Hyun Soo isn't the romantic type.

50
00:03:00.432 --> 00:03:01.942
What's wrong with you two?

51
00:03:02.303 --> 00:03:04.212
Your common denominator is me.

52
00:03:04.212 --> 00:03:06.173
You can't team up and tease me.

53
00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:07.513
Then who do we make fun of?

54
00:03:07.513 --> 00:03:09.282
We can't make fun of someone we don't know.

55
00:03:09.442 --> 00:03:11.453
That's right, Chef.

56
00:03:12.883 --> 00:03:15.252
You think I'll let you keep teasing me? Because I will.

57
00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:18.353
Come on.

58
00:03:19.893 --> 00:03:21.763
Chef, can we play some music?

59
00:03:22.163 --> 00:03:23.722
Stop it.

60
00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:30.573
Let's go! Get it on!

61
00:03:46.887 --> 00:03:47.983
Hello.

62
00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:49.853
Oh my, Hong Ah!

63
00:03:50.853 --> 00:03:52.453
My goodness.

64
00:03:52.992 --> 00:03:54.163
This is for you.

65
00:03:54.363 --> 00:03:56.293
What is this?

66
00:03:56.462 --> 00:03:58.663
I thought it'd suit you, so I got it.

67
00:03:59.562 --> 00:04:02.103
Congratulations on getting selected.

68
00:04:03.402 --> 00:04:06.772
It's all because you taught me well.

69
00:04:07.242 --> 00:04:08.442
I hope you've been well.

70
00:04:09.272 --> 00:04:12.272
Of course I'm not well. You must have heard.

71
00:04:13.143 --> 00:04:14.812
Well, yes.

72
00:04:14.812 --> 00:04:18.983
Hyun Soo's been badmouthing me all over town.

73
00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:22.082
I'm too embarrassed to see my seniors.

74
00:04:22.822 --> 00:04:24.822
- Is that so? - She's painting me...

75
00:04:24.822 --> 00:04:26.793
as some incredibly immoral person.

76
00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:29.892
Writers that are biased and just look at her appearance...

77
00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:31.632
believe everything she says.

78
00:04:32.093 --> 00:04:35.202
Do I look like someone who'd team up with a director,

79
00:04:35.202 --> 00:04:39.132
and stab writers on their backs?

80
00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:41.273
You're not that kind of person.

81
00:04:41.543 --> 00:04:43.803
People will know with time.

82
00:04:43.803 --> 00:04:44.843
Right?

83
00:04:45.512 --> 00:04:47.742
You should tell people too.

84
00:04:47.742 --> 00:04:49.783
Won't people trust me more if you say it,

85
00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:52.553
since you spent a long time with Hyun Soo?

86
00:04:53.783 --> 00:04:56.122
This is so embarrassing.

87
00:04:56.452 --> 00:04:58.923
Just because Hyun Soo's been badmouthing you,

88
00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:00.923
I don't think it'll damage your reputation that much.

89
00:05:01.963 --> 00:05:04.593
Who cares if your piece is doing well?

90
00:05:05.762 --> 00:05:07.192
Don't mind it too much.

91
00:05:07.632 --> 00:05:09.562
It's because I'm not doing well.

92
00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:11.702
It's so difficult to get a show.

93
00:05:12.572 --> 00:05:16.002
They prefer younger writers for genre shows.

94
00:05:17.103 --> 00:05:19.072
You're so honest.

95
00:05:19.572 --> 00:05:20.682
That's why I like you.

96
00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:23.413
I'm always the same on the outside and inside.

97
00:05:23.983 --> 00:05:26.752
Anyways, thank you.

98
00:05:27.252 --> 00:05:29.682
You're a good writer, and you have a good disposition.

99
00:05:29.682 --> 00:05:31.252
All that's left for you is to succeed.

100
00:05:31.952 --> 00:05:33.622
Thank you.

101
00:05:33.853 --> 00:05:36.062
Did you say hello to CP Yoo Hong Jin?

102
00:05:36.822 --> 00:05:38.932
- No. - Go say hello.

103
00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:42.663
Now the background you have will make you shine brighter.

104
00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:47.502
Thank you for your advice.

105
00:05:47.742 --> 00:05:49.742
This is why you need a mentor.

106
00:05:51.442 --> 00:05:53.872
Tell Hyun Soo not to badmouth me.

107
00:05:54.742 --> 00:05:58.382
She went to a good school. Why does she know so many people?

108
00:05:58.682 --> 00:06:01.082
Oh my gosh. What is this?

109
00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:04.952
This is our room.

110
00:06:07.053 --> 00:06:08.793
Go in. I'm that way.

111
00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:12.392
See you at the lobby in 30 minutes, Chef.

112
00:06:12.392 --> 00:06:13.463
Okay.

113
00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:28.312
Hyun Soo! Chef On is so great.

114
00:06:28.312 --> 00:06:30.543
He's super great.

115
00:06:30.983 --> 00:06:33.553
- So what? - You're stupid if you let him go.

116
00:06:34.182 --> 00:06:35.423
You think he's that good?

117
00:06:35.622 --> 00:06:39.223
Did you see his eyes? He has stars in his eyes.

118
00:06:39.492 --> 00:06:42.622
I've never seen any guy with stars in his eyes.

119
00:06:43.463 --> 00:06:45.062
I'm giving up on him because it's you.

120
00:06:45.163 --> 00:06:46.762
Stars? Don't be funny.

121
00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:49.103
I tell you. He has stars in his eyes.

122
00:06:49.562 --> 00:06:52.233
Twinkle, twinkle.

123
00:06:54.702 --> 00:06:56.303
(Director Kim Joon Ha)

124
00:06:56.473 --> 00:06:59.442
He just can't stand letting me feel happy.

125
00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:01.283
Do I have to transition from Chef On's face...

126
00:07:01.283 --> 00:07:03.952
to Director Kim Joon Ha's?

127
00:07:04.452 --> 00:07:05.483
Do it.

128
00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:08.223
You're jealous!

129
00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:09.423
No, I'm not.

130
00:07:12.293 --> 00:07:13.353
Yes, Director Kim.

131
00:07:13.853 --> 00:07:15.892
Where are you? I'm here.

132
00:07:16.562 --> 00:07:19.233
I'll be out there in a moment. Hyun Soo's occupied.

133
00:07:21.163 --> 00:07:22.403
Where are you?

134
00:07:22.932 --> 00:07:24.002
Okay.

135
00:07:28.543 --> 00:07:31.012
Hyun Soo checked in. I checked with Writer Hwangbo.

136
00:07:31.773 --> 00:07:33.613
I won't be able to join until dinner.

137
00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:35.682
I have some business to attend to.

138
00:07:36.642 --> 00:07:38.882
I see. No wonder you agreed to come so easily.

139
00:07:39.483 --> 00:07:40.682
You made more work.

140
00:07:41.653 --> 00:07:42.783
What are you going to do?

141
00:07:44.892 --> 00:07:47.262
I'll be with Writer Hwangbo. You do what you want to do.

142
00:07:47.762 --> 00:07:50.093
I'll set up the mood before then.

143
00:08:18.692 --> 00:08:20.353
- Let's go. - Okay.

144
00:08:22.822 --> 00:08:25.233
- You came down already? - Yes.

145
00:08:26.093 --> 00:08:27.403
Hyun Soo is on her way.

146
00:08:27.403 --> 00:08:28.963
I'm going out on my own.

147
00:08:28.963 --> 00:08:30.002
Why?

148
00:08:30.332 --> 00:08:33.202
A director I know came down, so I have to be with him.

149
00:08:33.373 --> 00:08:35.942
He has a weird personality, so he'll ruin the mood if he joins.

150
00:08:36.043 --> 00:08:37.043
I don't mind.

151
00:08:37.442 --> 00:08:39.472
If you can't handle it on your own, call me.

152
00:08:39.743 --> 00:08:43.013
Okay. Have fun with Hyun Soo.

153
00:08:46.212 --> 00:08:47.452
He said he's at the lobby. Where is he?

154
00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:17.553
Where do you want to go first?

155
00:09:18.153 --> 00:09:19.153
Have you been here?

156
00:09:19.153 --> 00:09:21.253
Of course. Yeosu's famous for their marinated crab.

157
00:09:22.482 --> 00:09:25.493
You still remember places by the food.

158
00:09:26.452 --> 00:09:29.163
Then let's go treat our eyes before we get food.

159
00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:52.852
This is nice.

160
00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:42.462
I'm hungry.

161
00:10:44.673 --> 00:10:45.972
You're consistent today.

162
00:10:46.633 --> 00:10:47.702
What do you mean?

163
00:10:48.673 --> 00:10:49.673
You broke the mood.

164
00:10:51.643 --> 00:10:53.072
I thought you'd comment...

165
00:10:54.082 --> 00:10:55.312
on the beautiful sunlight.

166
00:10:59.783 --> 00:11:01.822
How did you decide on coming here with me?

167
00:11:03.452 --> 00:11:04.493
I got bored.

168
00:11:06.553 --> 00:11:07.763
You're attractive when you're honest,

169
00:11:07.763 --> 00:11:09.123
but you just lost your charm.

170
00:11:10.293 --> 00:11:11.362
Love for mankind?

171
00:11:13.362 --> 00:11:15.062
Let's go eat marinated crab.

172
00:11:46.062 --> 00:11:49.232
Marinated crab is the best when you mix it with rice.

173
00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:51.202
You know how to eat it.

174
00:11:52.072 --> 00:11:53.702
What other good eats are here in Yeosu?

175
00:12:01.612 --> 00:12:02.643
It's good.

176
00:12:04.612 --> 00:12:05.612
Put your glasses on.

177
00:12:06.082 --> 00:12:07.523
Aren't people usually more pretty with glasses off?

178
00:12:08.222 --> 00:12:09.653
You look better with them on.

179
00:12:15.923 --> 00:12:17.023
Did I offend you?

180
00:12:17.592 --> 00:12:19.993
Do you feel inferior when people say something like this?

181
00:12:20.862 --> 00:12:22.633
You didn't offend me.

182
00:12:23.003 --> 00:12:26.773
I'll take off and put on my glasses as I please.

183
00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:29.303
I want to take them off right now because of you.

184
00:12:32.612 --> 00:12:33.643
Hey.

185
00:12:34.043 --> 00:12:35.212
Just talk in your accent.

186
00:12:35.712 --> 00:12:38.312
You're trying so hard to talk like a Seoul person. It's sad.

187
00:12:38.982 --> 00:12:40.212
Seriously!

188
00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:44.753
You're right.

189
00:12:45.123 --> 00:12:47.793
I'm trying to talk like a Seoul person...

190
00:12:47.793 --> 00:12:50.763
because everyone can guess where I'm from with the accent.

191
00:12:50.993 --> 00:12:53.232
I want to be mysterious.

192
00:12:56.062 --> 00:12:58.702
You won't become mysterious even without the accent.

193
00:13:00.702 --> 00:13:02.373
Are you buying lunch?

194
00:13:02.972 --> 00:13:06.072
- Yes. - That's why I'm holding back.

195
00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:08.712
I want to focus on the food.

196
00:13:15.783 --> 00:13:16.822
Here.

197
00:13:18.123 --> 00:13:19.553
Don't do such a thing.

198
00:13:20.053 --> 00:13:21.822
I don't want to become friendly with you.

199
00:13:31.273 --> 00:13:32.472
These are the famous rock crevices.

200
00:13:32.832 --> 00:13:35.173
If you pass through all seven of them, your wish will come true.

201
00:13:37.972 --> 00:13:39.342
Don't tell me. Just keep it in your mind.

202
00:13:40.312 --> 00:13:41.383
Have you decided?

203
00:13:42.513 --> 00:13:43.783
I did too. I'll go first.

204
00:13:43.883 --> 00:13:46.112
Be careful. Don't get lost again.

205
00:13:46.413 --> 00:13:48.383
It's impossible to get lost here.

206
00:13:48.753 --> 00:13:51.852
I even drive now. I'm not the old Hyun Soo.

208
00:14:12.212 --> 00:14:14.043
I only found out after Ms. Park called me.

209
00:14:14.682 --> 00:14:17.212
Why didn't you tell me your father is Yoosung Insurance's CEO?

210
00:14:17.682 --> 00:14:19.013
My cousin works there.

211
00:14:19.883 --> 00:14:23.623
Him being a CEO has nothing to do with me being recognized...

212
00:14:23.623 --> 00:14:24.793
for my work.

213
00:14:26.423 --> 00:14:27.993
You have a clear conscience.

214
00:14:32.993 --> 00:14:34.163
Please take a look at this.

215
00:14:34.163 --> 00:14:35.163
(High Society)

216
00:14:37.003 --> 00:14:38.572
Have you had any offers for a contract?

217
00:14:38.803 --> 00:14:41.643
I'm considering an offer from On Entertainment.

218
00:14:41.643 --> 00:14:44.043
On Entertainment is great. Mr. Park is smart.

219
00:14:47.643 --> 00:14:48.682
Hey, Yi Bok!

220
00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:51.482
Hey.

221
00:14:52.212 --> 00:14:53.612
You can go prepare without me.

222
00:14:56.283 --> 00:14:58.092
I'm going insane because of the script.

223
00:14:58.753 --> 00:15:01.623
I told you it wouldn't be any better with new writers.

224
00:15:01.822 --> 00:15:03.862
You're making it harder for yourself.

225
00:15:04.092 --> 00:15:06.033
It's not too late to call Ms. Lee.

226
00:15:06.393 --> 00:15:08.062
I can't do that...

227
00:15:08.062 --> 00:15:10.033
even if I have to bite my own tongue.

228
00:15:13.702 --> 00:15:15.072
Hello, sir.

229
00:15:16.003 --> 00:15:17.003
Hello.

230
00:15:17.243 --> 00:15:20.212
Her writing was selected for an HNC series.

231
00:15:20.612 --> 00:15:23.013
Is that so? Congratulations.

232
00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:26.712
You used to assist Ms. Lee, right?

233
00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:29.582
Don't you know a lot about "Unruly Detectives" then?

234
00:15:29.952 --> 00:15:31.192
Were you part of the planning?

235
00:15:31.623 --> 00:15:34.523
No, but I know it very well.

236
00:15:34.523 --> 00:15:38.592
Then can you give our writing team some advice?

237
00:15:39.962 --> 00:15:42.763
Are you asking me to join your writers?

238
00:15:43.663 --> 00:15:46.173
Gosh, you're quick.

239
00:15:47.903 --> 00:15:49.972
Why should I board a sinking ship?

240
00:15:50.972 --> 00:15:53.212
Gosh. This is great.

241
00:15:53.212 --> 00:15:55.612
She's so smart with her words. Am I right?

242
00:15:56.112 --> 00:15:57.112
Gosh.

243
00:15:57.952 --> 00:16:02.023
If you board our ship, perhaps it won't sink.

244
00:16:02.452 --> 00:16:03.482
I don't want to.

245
00:16:04.553 --> 00:16:05.952
If this one doesn't fail,

246
00:16:07.322 --> 00:16:08.822
we should work together next time.

247
00:16:11.263 --> 00:16:12.332
Will you still decline?

248
00:16:24.543 --> 00:16:27.072
Wow. It's so nice.

249
00:16:43.623 --> 00:16:45.663
I have to visit the ladies' room.

250
00:16:47.362 --> 00:16:50.102
Be careful. Don't get lost, okay?

251
00:16:50.533 --> 00:16:52.072
Are you kidding me?

252
00:16:52.332 --> 00:16:54.072
I've been here a few times.

253
00:17:33.983 --> 00:17:35.043
(Lee Hyun Soo)

254
00:17:37.683 --> 00:17:39.513
(On Jung Sun)

255
00:18:50.892 --> 00:18:53.392
I could only think about one thing at that point.

256
00:18:54.822 --> 00:18:56.523
I must see Jung Sun.

257
00:18:58.033 --> 00:19:00.293
He's the one I thought of at my desperate moments.

258
00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:03.973
I've never confused you.

259
00:19:03.973 --> 00:19:05.533
Why must I be the only one that assures you?

260
00:19:06.273 --> 00:19:09.672
You keep pushing away the man who loves you for reality's sake.

261
00:19:11.312 --> 00:19:13.443
What am I supposed to rely on to start again?

262
00:19:15.543 --> 00:19:16.812
Then give up on me.

263
00:19:18.513 --> 00:19:21.152
If it's something you can give up on, then do it now.

264
00:19:21.983 --> 00:19:23.622
I have a man whom I love.

265
00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:26.322
I realized it only too late.

266
00:19:27.493 --> 00:19:29.122
I didn't know what love was...

267
00:19:29.763 --> 00:19:31.832
until he disappeared.

268
00:19:34.003 --> 00:19:36.803
That man... Where can I see him now?

269
00:19:59.193 --> 00:20:00.993
You told me you wouldn't get lost.

270
00:20:26.053 --> 00:20:27.723
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:28.183 --> 00:20:29.683
It's my fault.

272
00:20:30.953 --> 00:20:32.652
I messed it all up.

273
00:20:33.392 --> 00:20:35.263
I was acting nonchalant and conceited.

274
00:20:35.263 --> 00:20:38.193
I ignored all the signs you sent me.

275
00:20:43.362 --> 00:20:46.602
I actually meant to call you honey.

276
00:20:48.003 --> 00:20:49.672
Is that important right now?

277
00:20:50.172 --> 00:20:53.342
I have to set things right.

278
00:20:56.642 --> 00:20:58.352
Forget about thinking.

279
00:20:59.082 --> 00:21:00.983
I lost you because I thought about it too much.

280
00:21:00.983 --> 00:21:02.223
So why should I think again?

281
00:21:03.152 --> 00:21:05.953
I thought about it enough times in the last five years.

282
00:21:10.362 --> 00:21:11.733
I love you.

283
00:21:17.233 --> 00:21:18.733
I'm in love with you.

284
00:21:21.703 --> 00:21:23.003
I know.

285
00:21:24.112 --> 00:21:27.213
"You've pushed me away once. Who says you can't do it again?"

286
00:21:27.213 --> 00:21:30.213
"Reality is always tough." These words were so mean.

287
00:21:30.213 --> 00:21:31.953
You got every single word.

288
00:21:32.013 --> 00:21:34.152
How can I tell you I love you when you say that?

289
00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:36.852
How can I admit I only thought about you?

290
00:21:36.852 --> 00:21:38.293
I told you, didn't I?

291
00:21:38.652 --> 00:21:40.392
I'm difficult in other ways.

292
00:21:41.793 --> 00:21:42.963
You did.

293
00:21:45.293 --> 00:21:46.793
Enough talking.

294
00:22:08.553 --> 00:22:10.453
I'll see you next time.

295
00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:20.602
(Yoo Hong Jin)

296
00:22:22.902 --> 00:22:23.933
Yes.

297
00:22:24.273 --> 00:22:27.003
Mr. Park. It's regarding our agreement.

298
00:22:27.372 --> 00:22:29.102
There's a new condition.

299
00:22:29.543 --> 00:22:30.612
What is it?

300
00:22:31.273 --> 00:22:33.983
You know Ji Hong Ah, right? She was Ms. Lee's assistant.

301
00:22:36.543 --> 00:22:37.612
Yes.

302
00:22:37.713 --> 00:22:40.082
We'll fire the two writers currently on the show,

303
00:22:40.082 --> 00:22:41.953
and replace them with Ms. Ji.

304
00:22:42.652 --> 00:22:45.553
Since she was under Ms. Lee, she knows the story well.

305
00:22:45.953 --> 00:22:48.662
At this rate, they'll cut "Unruly Detectives" prematurely.

306
00:22:48.763 --> 00:22:50.263
That will cause a big damage to On Entertainment.

307
00:22:50.263 --> 00:22:51.632
You can get international sales for it either.

308
00:23:03.602 --> 00:23:04.612
Yes.

309
00:23:05.443 --> 00:23:06.612
Where are you?

310
00:23:06.842 --> 00:23:07.983
Are you finished?

311
00:23:08.412 --> 00:23:10.243
Hang up. I'll text you.

312
00:23:13.513 --> 00:23:14.622
Why isn't Hyun Soo here yet?

313
00:23:15.753 --> 00:23:17.523
She'll come when the time comes.

314
00:23:17.622 --> 00:23:20.253
Where is she? Tell her to come back.

315
00:23:20.822 --> 00:23:22.023
Is she with someone?

316
00:23:22.162 --> 00:23:24.733
That's none of your business.

317
00:23:25.332 --> 00:23:26.892
I'll ask her where she is.

318
00:23:38.473 --> 00:23:39.572
Aren't you going to check?

319
00:23:40.582 --> 00:23:42.483
I won't check since I'm with you.

320
00:23:42.812 --> 00:23:45.112
You can do anything you want since you're with me.

321
00:23:50.352 --> 00:23:52.253
(Where are you?)

322
00:23:52.422 --> 00:23:53.693
Where are you?

323
00:23:54.023 --> 00:23:56.392
It's Kyung. Should I tell her to come?

324
00:23:57.193 --> 00:23:58.293
Do you want her to?

325
00:23:59.193 --> 00:24:01.933
We came on the trip together, but I'm the only one having fun.

326
00:24:03.263 --> 00:24:04.632
Do what you want.

327
00:24:06.332 --> 00:24:08.842
No. I'll see her at the hotel.

328
00:24:19.183 --> 00:24:21.422
Hyun Soo went to the Soho Dongdong Bridge.

329
00:24:22.622 --> 00:24:24.223
It'll be like a movie to meet her there.

330
00:24:33.033 --> 00:24:36.662
By the way, why did she go to the bridge alone?

331
00:24:37.402 --> 00:24:39.473
When did I say that she went alone?

332
00:24:40.503 --> 00:24:41.503
Isn't she alone?

333
00:24:41.602 --> 00:24:42.672
No.

334
00:24:43.503 --> 00:24:46.013
She's not with a guy, is she?

335
00:24:46.043 --> 00:24:47.312
It's a guy.

336
00:24:48.283 --> 00:24:50.912
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

337
00:24:50.912 --> 00:24:52.812
You didn't ask me!

338
00:24:53.412 --> 00:24:55.023
(Jung Woo)

339
00:24:56.082 --> 00:24:57.223
What's wrong with him?

340
00:24:57.622 --> 00:24:58.622
(Kim Joon Ha)

341
00:25:01.322 --> 00:25:02.362
Yes, Joon Ha.

342
00:25:03.122 --> 00:25:05.763
Jung Woo, I was wrong. Hyun Soo isn't there.

343
00:25:05.963 --> 00:25:07.233
Come straight to the hotel.

344
00:25:08.033 --> 00:25:09.062
Really?

345
00:25:10.872 --> 00:25:11.902
All right.

346
00:25:12.703 --> 00:25:13.703
You'll come here, right?

347
00:25:14.642 --> 00:25:16.902
No. I'll go visit the bridge...

348
00:25:16.902 --> 00:25:19.112
while I'm here.

349
00:25:20.743 --> 00:25:22.743
(End call)

350
00:25:34.062 --> 00:25:35.392
It's so nice.

351
00:25:37.733 --> 00:25:41.602
- Aren't you cold? - No, I'm fine.

352
00:25:51.443 --> 00:25:53.312
I don't think you're fine.

353
00:25:55.312 --> 00:25:57.112
It's okay even if I'm not fine.

354
00:26:40.322 --> 00:26:41.562
I wish...

355
00:26:42.793 --> 00:26:45.062
time would stop right now.

356
00:27:23.132 --> 00:27:25.233
I have a man that I love.

357
00:27:26.703 --> 00:27:28.773
I didn't know what love was...

358
00:27:29.072 --> 00:27:31.473
until he disappeared.

359
00:27:36.812 --> 00:27:38.053
I want to propose.

360
00:27:39.053 --> 00:27:40.922
When? Who?

361
00:27:41.723 --> 00:27:44.693
I usually make the important decisions on my own.

362
00:27:44.993 --> 00:27:47.892
That woman is so lucky to be such an important person.

363
00:27:48.493 --> 00:27:49.793
Do you really think so?

364
00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:51.993
Yes. You're the best guy there is.
