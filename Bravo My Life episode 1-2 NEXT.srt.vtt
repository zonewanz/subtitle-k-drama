1
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.061
Cut!

2
00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:44.411
Is she okay? How is her injury?

3
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.512
Luckily, her injuries are minor. The problem is...

4
00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:48.612
we don't have a stunt woman who can be here before sunset.

5
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:55.421
I'll do it.

6
00:00:57.892 --> 00:01:00.021
- You're crazy. - I'm sure I can do it.

7
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:02.521
If we don't shoot it now, the connecting shot will have problems.

8
00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:04.261
- Ha Do Na. - Yes.

9
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:05.991
Why am I here today?

10
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:09.161
You're here as Director Kim's substitute because he collapsed.

11
00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:12.032
That's right. I'm just here for one day. I can't cause any trouble.

12
00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:13.972
Please think about Director Kim's position.

13
00:01:13.972 --> 00:01:16.241
He collapsed because we're not getting good ratings,

14
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:18.342
and the filming schedule is too tight.

15
00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:22.112
As the production assistant, I can't have unnaturally connected scenes.

16
00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:40.761
All right. Let's do this in sync and finish it in one take.

17
00:01:41.032 --> 00:01:42.131
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

18
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:43.601
Let's start.

19
00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:45.732
Standby!

20
00:02:55.972 --> 00:02:57.011
What?

21
00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:04.282
Watch out!

22
00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:26.942
(Episode 1)

23
00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.511
(Operating Room)

24
00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:41.552
- You're here. - Mom.

25
00:03:50.192 --> 00:03:51.631
Do Na is in a critical condition.

26
00:03:51.962 --> 00:03:53.361
She has lost so much blood.

27
00:03:53.562 --> 00:03:57.201
They say her blood type is cis-AB or something.

28
00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:00.171
I called you just in case.

29
00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:46.721
Ha Young.

30
00:04:47.982 --> 00:04:49.321
Do you really have to go?

31
00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.461
I'll let you go, but you have to promise me one thing.

32
00:04:54.591 --> 00:04:55.961
Be happy.

33
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:58.292
Otherwise, it will be an insult to my love.

34
00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:01.162
I won't wait for you,

35
00:05:01.562 --> 00:05:03.602
but if there comes a day that you want to die...

36
00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:06.701
send me a text message saying, "Save me."

37
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:09.002
My number will stay the same until the day I die.

38
00:05:20.682 --> 00:05:21.922
Great.

39
00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.321
You're good.

40
00:05:25.622 --> 00:05:26.622
Thank you.

41
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:42.172
Reporters asked me...

42
00:05:42.172 --> 00:05:46.412
whether you're Song Mi Ja, the madam of a conglomerate.

43
00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:47.942
Will you be okay?

44
00:05:48.312 --> 00:05:50.982
Do Na's condition is what's most important for now.

45
00:05:55.052 --> 00:05:57.891
Do Na, can you recognize me?

46
00:05:58.752 --> 00:06:00.021
My goodness.

47
00:06:08.531 --> 00:06:11.602
She's the person with the same blood type as yours.

48
00:06:11.602 --> 00:06:13.701
She volunteered to donate her blood for you.

49
00:06:16.471 --> 00:06:19.982
I know...

50
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.011
this woman.

51
00:06:22.942 --> 00:06:27.151
(Chicken Kalguksu)

52
00:06:27.151 --> 00:06:31.151
(Chicken Kalguksu)

53
00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:48.872
("Thyme")

54
00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:24.312
Do Na, come eat your meal. Do Na.

55
00:07:25.172 --> 00:07:26.172
Okay.

56
00:07:41.821 --> 00:07:43.662
("Thyme")

57
00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:45.692
Gosh, it's hot.

58
00:08:00.412 --> 00:08:03.381
- It's a strange coincidence. - What is?

59
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:05.511
I mean, the actress who appeared on my dad's movie...

60
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:07.422
turned out to have the same blood type as me.

61
00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:11.352
That's why I told you you were so lucky.

62
00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:16.192
And it's strange you knew her number.

63
00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:21.002
She used to call me on holidays.

64
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:23.672
Stop talking and eat up. It might get cold.

65
00:08:23.672 --> 00:08:24.701
Okay.

66
00:08:43.792 --> 00:08:45.892
Will you buy me a drink?

67
00:09:01.601 --> 00:09:03.142
Did...

68
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.111
Did you...

69
00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:10.111
Did you drink...

70
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:12.412
Cut!

71
00:09:12.611 --> 00:09:15.481
Gosh, he's such an idiot.

72
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:19.091
Hey, you.

73
00:09:19.251 --> 00:09:22.392
I came here once again for the sake of my applause.

74
00:09:23.692 --> 00:09:26.262
- This is so annoying. - I'm sorry, Ha Young.

75
00:09:28.562 --> 00:09:30.201
You punk.

76
00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:31.772
You're good at improvising,

77
00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:34.341
but you're horrible at acting for real.

78
00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:36.371
Ha Young rearranged her schedule...

79
00:09:36.371 --> 00:09:38.142
because you asked for one last chance.

80
00:09:38.672 --> 00:09:41.942
It's all your fault, punk.

81
00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:45.912
Hey, go get Ha Young.

82
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:47.321
Stop her from leaving.

83
00:10:12.971 --> 00:10:15.882
Goodness.

84
00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:22.652
She only did it out of loyalty.

85
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:24.591
Can't you let it go?

86
00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:27.692
You're well aware of what she did.

87
00:10:28.091 --> 00:10:30.032
Of course, I am.

88
00:10:31.132 --> 00:10:33.831
Not to mention that she hired 500 background actors...

89
00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:37.132
for the historical drama, she messed up so many things.

90
00:10:37.132 --> 00:10:39.001
And why are you trying to dump her on me?

91
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:42.302
Goodness, she's passionate.

92
00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:45.211
She's a total lunatic,

93
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:48.542
but you know she works harder than any other production assistants.

94
00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:49.951
It's good...

95
00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:52.412
that she's passionate and is crazy about dramas.

96
00:10:53.081 --> 00:10:54.621
But if I take her as my production assistant,

97
00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:57.052
I'll be too anxious to focus on my work.

98
00:10:57.922 --> 00:11:01.292
She's so depressed because no directors are willing...

99
00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:03.062
to take her as their crew.

100
00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:05.991
You're the only one who can control her.

101
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:08.562
Dong Woo, please.

102
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:14.971
I refuse.

103
00:11:22.512 --> 00:11:24.481
Goodness, that punk.

104
00:11:26.682 --> 00:11:28.522
Director Shin.

105
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:30.422
I sent Do Hyun the script. Did he read it?

106
00:11:30.422 --> 00:11:32.251
Did you cast Seol Do Hyun?

107
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:35.091
Tell him to read it quickly. Let's not drag time.

108
00:11:35.091 --> 00:11:37.532
Do Hyun's known for his temper.

109
00:11:37.532 --> 00:11:39.231
Let me be in charge of him.

110
00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:41.201
I'll work hard. I promise.

111
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.701
You always mess things up by working hard.

112
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:46.772
I'll work hard, but not too much.

113
00:11:48.172 --> 00:11:49.772
- Do Na. - Yes?

114
00:11:49.772 --> 00:11:51.611
Do Na. Ha Do Na.

115
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:54.711
I was so frightened by you that my heart races even now.

116
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:57.312
It was because it happened so suddenly.

117
00:11:57.312 --> 00:12:00.152
But at least the connecting scenes flowed well in the final edit.

118
00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:04.351
I don't want to work with such a thoughtless person like you.

119
00:12:10.292 --> 00:12:14.162
Well, give me... Give me just one more chance.

120
00:12:24.412 --> 00:12:25.772
- Hello. - Hello.

121
00:12:25.772 --> 00:12:26.812
Hi.

122
00:12:28.282 --> 00:12:31.581
You're beautiful as always, Ms. Song.

123
00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:36.081
My wife used to be quite pretty too.

124
00:12:37.052 --> 00:12:39.451
How could I ever compare my beauty to yours?

125
00:12:39.621 --> 00:12:42.692
My goodness, stop it. You're embarrassing me.

126
00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:46.192
What's gotten into you today? Why are you so humble?

127
00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:48.461
Honey.

128
00:12:49.932 --> 00:12:52.101
You two are still so affectionate like newly weds.

129
00:12:52.902 --> 00:12:54.871
- Let's sit down. - Okay.

130
00:12:58.642 --> 00:13:00.282
Where's your youngest daughter?

131
00:13:01.012 --> 00:13:04.111
She was causing so much trouble, so we kicked her out.

132
00:13:06.351 --> 00:13:09.282
Your jokes are always so funny.

133
00:13:20.662 --> 00:13:22.132
A small wedding?

134
00:13:24.902 --> 00:13:26.971
There's a French phrase that says, "Noblesse oblige".

135
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:31.772
I think wealthy people like us should set an example to society.

136
00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:35.782
But I'm sure both our families have a lot of guests to invite.

137
00:13:36.412 --> 00:13:39.081
Yes, Ms. Song. You're completely right.

138
00:13:39.312 --> 00:13:43.422
If people like us have an extravagant wedding,

139
00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:45.652
it'll only give people more things to talk about.

140
00:13:47.361 --> 00:13:48.522
I agree with you.

141
00:14:01.402 --> 00:14:02.942
Did you want to eat jjamppong that badly?

142
00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:06.682
Yes. My grandma always cooks me beef bone soup.

143
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:08.581
I'm so tired of eating that.

144
00:14:08.711 --> 00:14:09.912
If you say one more word,

145
00:14:11.182 --> 00:14:13.321
I'm going to rip your tongue out of your mouth.

146
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.331
What a complete lunatic.

147
00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:26.461
He was talking to me, right?

148
00:14:29.361 --> 00:14:31.032
- What's wrong with him? - My gosh.

149
00:14:31.032 --> 00:14:32.231
Eat up.

150
00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:39.882
The doctor refused to tell me,

151
00:14:40.341 --> 00:14:42.512
but I insisted on knowing.

152
00:14:44.412 --> 00:14:45.682
He said it's a son.

153
00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:51.522
How can he tell when it's so small?

154
00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:53.461
Do you not like that it's a son?

155
00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.632
No, that's not it.

156
00:14:58.792 --> 00:15:02.762
Will you be able to keep shooting when you're pregnant?

157
00:15:05.101 --> 00:15:07.471
I'm not even sure if I'm going to give birth to him or not.

158
00:15:07.871 --> 00:15:09.101
And...

159
00:15:09.101 --> 00:15:11.942
I'm just a cameo in that movie, so I just need to shoot one more scene.

160
00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:13.142
What do you mean you might not give birth to him?

161
00:15:13.442 --> 00:15:15.581
I'm never going to give birth to my son out of wedlock.

162
00:15:24.392 --> 00:15:26.292
Don't even dare try to threaten me...

163
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:29.121
with my child.

164
00:15:30.792 --> 00:15:31.892
Chairman Jung.

165
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:36.932
Do whatever you want.

166
00:15:37.802 --> 00:15:40.672
But I want you to safely give birth to my baby.

167
00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:44.772
Chairman Jung.

168
00:15:52.382 --> 00:15:53.751
Why are you insisting on making me have a small wedding?

169
00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:55.552
Can't you set a good example to society?

170
00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:58.422
You had the biggest wedding of the century.

171
00:15:58.422 --> 00:16:00.991
Why are you trying to make me have a small wedding?

172
00:16:02.392 --> 00:16:04.961
How dare you talk back to me like that?

173
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:07.562
You better treat me with more respect.

174
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:09.231
Why are you two arguing?

175
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:11.201
Honey, you're home early.

176
00:16:12.601 --> 00:16:15.601
Dad, I don't want a small wedding.

177
00:16:16.471 --> 00:16:19.812
Then don't have a small wedding. Don't take it out on your mom.

178
00:16:20.341 --> 00:16:21.611
Okay.

179
00:16:29.081 --> 00:16:31.991
Did you see her get angry when I suggested having a small wedding?

180
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.562
You're so mean.

181
00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:36.991
She used to ignore me so much...

182
00:16:36.991 --> 00:16:40.701
just because I used to be an actress and didn't graduate college.

183
00:16:40.762 --> 00:16:44.571
I don't know if I should call you cute or immature.

184
00:16:46.201 --> 00:16:49.001
Didn't you fall in love with me because I was immature?

185
00:16:49.402 --> 00:16:53.382
I didn't know that you'd always be so immature.

186
00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.932
Ms. Song, it's time for your English lesson.

187
00:17:18.132 --> 00:17:19.271
Okay.

188
00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:29.142
I don't know this number.

189
00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:33.622
Hello?

190
00:17:34.382 --> 00:17:36.221
How could I not do anything when I was being sexually harassed?

191
00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.852
I was only trying to protect myself.

192
00:17:37.852 --> 00:17:39.291
What did I even do?

193
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:43.132
You put your hand on my thigh saying you'll put in a good word for me.

194
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:45.491
Two of my teeth are wobbling right now.

195
00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:47.301
She just punched me out of the blue.

196
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:49.501
Do you think I punched you for no reason?

197
00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:53.342
Did you or did you not ask me out after putting your hand on my thigh?

198
00:17:56.001 --> 00:17:59.072
I was just trying to help her out.

199
00:17:59.072 --> 00:18:00.281
- So I just... - You were trying to help me?

200
00:18:01.142 --> 00:18:02.382
You were trying to help?

201
00:18:02.382 --> 00:18:04.481
Is that why you stopped me from leaving...

202
00:18:04.481 --> 00:18:05.682
and sexually harassed me like that?

203
00:18:05.682 --> 00:18:07.152
How can you call that sexual harassment?

204
00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:08.322
Please sit down.

205
00:18:08.682 --> 00:18:09.721
Sung Ah.

206
00:18:28.402 --> 00:18:30.241
(Our Neighbourhood’s Friendly Police)

207
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:32.172
Hey, when did I...

208
00:18:32.741 --> 00:18:34.382
Don't ever come to my office again.

209
00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:36.082
Come with me.

210
00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:38.612
- Hey, let me... - Shut it.

211
00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.622
Good going.

212
00:18:44.422 --> 00:18:46.192
If you signed a memorandum stating you'll give up your inheritance,

213
00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:49.122
Then you should've at least gotten married.

214
00:18:49.592 --> 00:18:51.862
Why did you take it out on him for getting dumped?

215
00:18:51.862 --> 00:18:53.461
Why would you even mention that right now?

216
00:18:53.461 --> 00:18:55.001
I'm just so disappointed in you.

217
00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:57.372
I would've handled it on my own even if you didn't come.

218
00:18:57.372 --> 00:19:00.372
Then why did you tell the police my number?

219
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:05.342
You would've gotten sued for assault if I hadn't come.

220
00:19:06.842 --> 00:19:10.451
I really don't understand why you're living like this.

221
00:19:10.451 --> 00:19:12.211
You said I'm being ungrateful for what I have.

222
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:13.622
You can just keep thinking that way.

223
00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:17.291
Sung Ah. Sung Ah.

224
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:18.951
My gosh, she's so stubborn.

225
00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:24.991
Ms. Shin.

226
00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:28.961
My goodness. Director Ha.

227
00:19:30.172 --> 00:19:31.201
My gosh.

228
00:19:31.971 --> 00:19:33.602
What brings you here?

229
00:19:35.402 --> 00:19:36.412
Here.

230
00:19:36.711 --> 00:19:39.142
I brought you some of your favourite side dishes.

231
00:19:39.142 --> 00:19:42.582
I brought seasoned deodeok, salted chili, and marinated crabs.

232
00:19:42.582 --> 00:19:44.781
My goodness, you didn't have to.

233
00:19:49.322 --> 00:19:51.021
You must be here to ask me for a favor.

234
00:19:54.791 --> 00:19:56.291
Ms. Shin.

235
00:19:56.291 --> 00:20:00.432
Can you tell Director Shin to take me in as his staff?

236
00:20:00.761 --> 00:20:03.832
My gosh, he never listens to me.

237
00:20:04.572 --> 00:20:07.072
Come on, Ms. Shin. Please?

238
00:20:07.442 --> 00:20:08.541
Please.

239
00:20:25.352 --> 00:20:26.422
Cut! Okay.

240
00:20:26.622 --> 00:20:27.822
- Good work. - Good work.

241
00:20:27.822 --> 00:20:29.731
- Good work. - Good work.

242
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:31.362
- Good work. - Good work.

243
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:33.801
Ms. Shin.

244
00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:39.001
My gosh, I don't need this. You can give it to another woman.

245
00:20:40.241 --> 00:20:42.241
I'm married to you.

246
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.741
My gosh, that's disgusting.

247
00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:46.981
Congratulations on your last shoot.

248
00:20:46.981 --> 00:20:48.112
Congratulations.

249
00:20:48.682 --> 00:20:51.981
I'll eventually die after shooting and ending dramas like this, right?

250
00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:53.822
I'll let you die in my arms.

251
00:20:53.822 --> 00:20:55.521
I'll carry the bier.

252
00:20:55.622 --> 00:20:57.521
You might as well just tell me to die.

253
00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:00.291
Good work.

254
00:21:00.991 --> 00:21:03.231
Director Shin, what brings you all the way here?

255
00:21:04.761 --> 00:21:06.632
Let's not waste time on useless things.

256
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:08.132
Yes, of course.

257
00:21:10.801 --> 00:21:12.072
Here's your next drama.

258
00:21:12.872 --> 00:21:15.971
I don't want to do it. I want to take some rest.

259
00:21:16.711 --> 00:21:18.072
You should take a look at your role first.

260
00:21:18.072 --> 00:21:19.471
No matter how great the character is.

261
00:21:19.471 --> 00:21:20.842
I don't want to die from exhaustion.

262
00:21:20.842 --> 00:21:22.011
Just take a look at it.

263
00:21:24.711 --> 00:21:26.882
Why aren't you taking in Do Na as your staff?

264
00:21:28.251 --> 00:21:29.751
How do you know about that?

265
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:36.662
- Director Shin. - Yes?

266
00:21:37.261 --> 00:21:39.561
What's she doing this time?

267
00:21:42.001 --> 00:21:44.301
Who would ever understand that lunatic?

268
00:21:44.301 --> 00:21:47.442
I want to learn from you. Please accept me as your staff.

269
00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:56.342
You watched too many martial arts movies.

270
00:21:58.251 --> 00:22:00.521
I promise I won't cause you any trouble this time.

271
00:22:01.352 --> 00:22:05.422
She's trying so hard. Why don't you just give her a chance?

272
00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:07.991
She seems really desperate.

273
00:22:10.791 --> 00:22:12.461
Please take me in as your staff!

If you cause any trouble, I'll fire you right away.

276
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:37.652
Yes, sir.

277
00:22:38.251 --> 00:22:40.622
You said you'd handle Seol Do Hyun, so don't mess it up.

Yes, sir.

Start arranging auditions first.

280
00:22:43.791 --> 00:22:46.291
It's an honour to work with you, Director Shin.

281
00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:47.731
Stop fussing.

282
00:22:54.402 --> 00:22:55.402
Hello.

283
00:22:56.001 --> 00:22:57.771
- Hello, director. - Hi.

284
00:23:00.811 --> 00:23:02.211
Thank you.

285
00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:05.882
You're early. That's surprising.

286
00:23:07.021 --> 00:23:10.021
I've already decided to do it, so I should do my best.

287

She's our production assistant.

Take notes.

00:23:25.172 --> 00:23:27.102
Please remove the water purifier in his dressing room.

291
00:23:27.102 --> 00:23:29.811
Do Hyun drinks his own water.

292
00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:34.281
Then it doesn't matter if there is a water purifier or not, does it?

293
00:23:35.882 --> 00:23:39.082
Do Hyun might drink it by mistake.

294
00:23:41.451 --> 00:23:42.822
Don't say anything. Just write it down.

295
00:23:44.051 --> 00:23:45.122
Okay.

296
00:23:45.122 --> 00:23:48.761
For the lighting, please use the model we asked before.

297

00:23:50.632 --> 00:23:52.031
- Please have a seat here. - Hello, director.

Oh, my. Do Hyun.

300
00:23:58.172 --> 00:23:59.771
I'm not late, am I?

301
00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:02.342
I came early today.

302
00:24:04.412 --> 00:24:05.672
I liked the script.

303
00:24:06.271 --> 00:24:09.682
Director Shin, I love my role.

304
00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:13.122
Also, I'm so happy to work with Do Hyun.

305
00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:16.951
We were listening to Do Hyun's requests,

306
00:24:16.951 --> 00:24:18.122
so let us finish first.

307
00:24:18.622 --> 00:24:21.822
Sure. I don't have any requests to make,

308
00:24:21.822 --> 00:24:23.692
so please take your time.

309
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:26.832
How have you been?

310
00:24:30.332 --> 00:24:32.501
Do you still have feelings for Do Hyun?

311
00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:34.342
Don't be ridiculous.

312
00:24:34.342 --> 00:24:36.241
Why were you so submissive to Do Hyun then?

313
00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:38.811
I wasn't submissive to him.

314
00:24:40.711 --> 00:24:43.882
If rumours about you two spread, you'll end up with nothing.

315
00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:45.951
I know. I know that too.

316
00:24:47.352 --> 00:24:48.682
My gosh.

317
00:24:52.652 --> 00:24:54.221
Say one more word,

318
00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:58.231
and I will pull your tongue off.

319
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:03.031
That's enough.

320
00:25:03.332 --> 00:25:05.072
I prepared other things too.

321
00:25:05.172 --> 00:25:07.142
I know you're a good actor with good sensibility.

322
00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:09.072
You're good-looking too.

323
00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:11.011
But that's useless...

324
00:25:11.372 --> 00:25:13.011
because you can't do anything at the set.

325
00:25:16.142 --> 00:25:17.882
I haven't seen you around. What have you been up to?

326
00:25:17.882 --> 00:25:19.112
I did my military duty.

327
00:25:19.412 --> 00:25:21.322
I see. You can go now.

328
00:25:27.922 --> 00:25:29.221
Let's take a little break.

329
00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:31.061
Okay.

330
00:25:38.402 --> 00:25:40.001
Director Shin, no.

331
00:25:44.612 --> 00:25:45.672
I know.

332
00:25:46.041 --> 00:25:48.342
You're still thinking about it.

333
00:25:49.511 --> 00:25:50.612
Everyone feels bad for him.

334
00:25:50.612 --> 00:25:52.951
His acting is so touching during the practice, but that's no use.

335
00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:55.251
He can't say a word on set.

336
00:25:55.352 --> 00:25:58.322
Director Shin, we can never cast him. Never.

337
00:26:20.711 --> 00:26:23.451
Do Na. Do you want to make Kim Bum Woo a real actor?

338
00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.051
Director Shin!

339
00:26:27.251 --> 00:26:29.852
You might be able to change his life.

340
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:32.392
The thing that I hate to do the most...

341
00:26:32.392 --> 00:26:34.162
is meddling in someone's life.

342
00:26:34.692 --> 00:26:36.731
How dare you yell at me while spitting rice on me?

343
00:26:38.561 --> 00:26:40.961
Just tell me to kill myself instead. I'd rather do that.

344
00:26:40.961 --> 00:26:43.031
Why would I tell you to kill yourself?

345
00:26:43.471 --> 00:26:46.971
What you're asking me is even harder than killing myself.

346
00:26:49.442 --> 00:26:51.311
I've known him for seven years.

347
00:26:51.971 --> 00:26:53.912
- I also... - Isn't he too good to discard?

348
00:26:55.682 --> 00:26:58.811
He is, but he can't do his job.

349
00:26:58.811 --> 00:27:00.451
If you make him a real actor,

350
00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:03.221
I might help you début as a director of Team B.

351
00:27:06.352 --> 00:27:09.021
Challenge yourself, you brat.

352
00:27:16.572 --> 00:27:17.701
Director Shin.

353
00:27:41.779 --> 00:27:43.449
(Episode 2)

354
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.789
Why are you still like that?

355
00:27:56.089 --> 00:27:59.500
You'll be the director of Team B, right? Do it. What's the problem?

356
00:27:59.699 --> 00:28:01.699
You don't know how bad he is.

357
00:28:01.699 --> 00:28:04.969
Among the things you decided to do, what have you failed? None, right?

358
00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:08.570
Him. Making him a real actor.

359
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.310
That's the only thing in the world that I cannot do.

360
00:28:12.039 --> 00:28:13.149
No way.

361
00:28:16.179 --> 00:28:17.950
This is driving me crazy.

362
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.420
What should I do?

363
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:23.189
No.

364
00:28:23.189 --> 00:28:25.359
Hey, you're scaring me.

365
00:28:26.429 --> 00:28:27.590
Stop it.

366
00:28:33.229 --> 00:28:35.630
Ms. Song, you're overdoing it today.

367
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.140
There are some days I want to keep going.

368
00:28:37.439 --> 00:28:38.469
Here.

369
00:28:44.579 --> 00:28:45.680
You're home.

370
00:28:45.879 --> 00:28:49.049
What's up with you? You never come to greet me when you get home.

371
00:28:49.349 --> 00:28:50.349
Here.

372
00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:52.219
What is this?

373
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.390
(List of wedding gifts)

374
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.159
(300,000 dollars of cash, an Italian suit, a Swiss watch)

375
00:29:03.159 --> 00:29:05.359
- Are you an idiot? - Mom.

376
00:29:05.359 --> 00:29:08.900
These are gifts you give someone to ask them to marry an idiot.

377
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.469
I don't want to be found fault with.

378
00:29:11.769 --> 00:29:14.670
- Have they got something on you? - Mom.

379
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.680
Our family is wealthier than them.

380
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.510
So why would you lower yourself?

381
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.750
Can't you just do what I want?

382
00:29:22.879 --> 00:29:25.420
- Leave us. - Okay.

383
00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:34.689
- Do you love him? - What?

384
00:29:34.689 --> 00:29:36.359
Do you even love Joon Ho?

385
00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:38.530
Why else would I want to marry him?

386
00:29:38.829 --> 00:29:40.469
You don't love him.

387
00:29:40.469 --> 00:29:42.469
That's why you made this kind of a list.

388
00:29:42.469 --> 00:29:45.300
I want to give his family good things because I love him.

389
00:29:45.969 --> 00:29:50.110
You don't have to marry the man your father chose.

390
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.710
Why are you doing this now?

391
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.879
I'm just worried that...

392
00:29:53.879 --> 00:29:56.250
you don't look like a girl in love.

393
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.050
You're delusional.

394
00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:04.289
I'm really worried about you, you silly girl.

395
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:14.030
(Friendly chauffeur service)

396
00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.469
I'm here to work as a chauffeur.

397
00:30:15.469 --> 00:30:18.199
- I see. Give me a moment. - Okay.

398
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:31.080
Even if I leave and become the wind

399
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.120
I will still be around you

400
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:43.099
You will still love her

401
00:30:43.099 --> 00:30:47.069
When you leave repulsed by me

402
00:30:47.069 --> 00:30:48.270
I'll let you go

403
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:52.870
I won't shed a tear even if you die

404
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:08.719
Okay, I can't help it, I guess.

405
00:31:09.219 --> 00:31:10.319
Sure.

406
00:31:18.099 --> 00:31:20.800
Hey, you don't have to go.

407
00:31:24.699 --> 00:31:27.139
- Can't he come? - It looks like...

408
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.280
he's avoiding sleeping with me because of my supposed kid.

409
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:33.879
What will you do now?

410
00:31:33.879 --> 00:31:37.449
Exactly. I have to sleep with him to really get pregnant or something.

411
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.949
What if he finds out?

412
00:31:42.419 --> 00:31:43.960
Stop cursing it.

413
00:31:44.689 --> 00:31:46.219
I'm the one who brought...

414
00:31:46.219 --> 00:31:47.960
the whole thing this far after that one lucky night.

415
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.459
I'm not going to throw that away, so don't worry.

416
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:53.029
What if I never get a chance?

417
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.600
That's why I made you start that mini-series gig.

418
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.670
You can later say you lost the kid because you worked too much.

419
00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.870
What if the doctor says something else?

420
00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.709
Do you think I began the whole thing without planning that much?

421
00:32:09.779 --> 00:32:12.680
If you don't feel confident, I'll find another production assistant.

422
00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.420
Director Shin.

423
00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.589
Why are you making me do something even you couldn't do?

424
00:32:18.589 --> 00:32:20.089
I'm a normal guy, but you're...

425
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.430
a bit insane.

426
00:32:25.699 --> 00:32:29.170
I think a normal guy like me is of no use to Bum Woo.

427
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.600
You never know.

428
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:33.240
He might need someone like you.

429
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.939
Gosh, this is driving me insane.

430
00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:39.009
What am I supposed to do?

431
00:32:54.189 --> 00:32:55.329
I'm here.

432
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.769
I can't believe I have an obstacle like you in my life.

433
00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.269
Pardon?

434
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.110
Follow me.

435
00:33:18.819 --> 00:33:20.420
Choose 1, and take 1.

436
00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.290
Choose 1, missus, and take 1, mister.

437
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.019
Choose 1, and take 1.

438
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:26.889
Choose 1 and take 1, it's 2 for 10 dollars.

439
00:33:26.889 --> 00:33:29.060
An unbelievable quality!

440
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.329
Wear this, and you won't envy any models.

441
00:33:31.329 --> 00:33:32.629
It's my product, but it's great.

442
00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:33.899
Do you need one?

443
00:33:34.699 --> 00:33:35.730
Come around.

444
00:33:36.129 --> 00:33:37.899
Choose 1, and take 1.

445
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.170
Choose 1, and take 1. Choose 1, and take 1.

446
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.110
Choose 1, missus, and take 1, mister.

447
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.180
Choose 1, ma'am, and take 1, sir.

448
00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:47.379
An amazing quality at an affordable price.

449
00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:48.879
Come and choose one.

450
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.490
You've done this before, haven't you?

451
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.029
No.

452
00:34:05.529 --> 00:34:08.269
That means you can improvise pretty well too.

453
00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.000
So what am I going to do about you?

454
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.610
Have you been in a play?

455
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.509
I practiced for three months,

456
00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:22.610
but couldn't say a word on stage.

457
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.319
I got beaten up and kicked out.

458
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.120
What about the army? Have you been to the army?

459
00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.290
I was a Marine.

460
00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.620
Goodness, you've done pretty much everything you can.

461
00:34:33.259 --> 00:34:35.860
So what are you going to do now?

462
00:34:38.259 --> 00:34:40.529
Hey, you. This is your homework.

463
00:34:41.129 --> 00:34:44.170
Record your life daily life, and send it to my email.

464
00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.240
Understood?

465
00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.569
Pardon?

466
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.339
What am I going to do about him?

467
00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.209
My daily life?

468
00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:58.449
(Juvis Group)

469
00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.589
There are rumors that say...

470
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:05.089
your wife is the mother of Director Ha Min Hyuk's daughter.

471
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.379
I'll get a hold of his daughter, Ha Do Na's DNA...

472
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.449
and find out if the rumour is true.

473
00:35:41.529 --> 00:35:43.300
I know my woman.

474
00:35:45.129 --> 00:35:46.430
I'm sure that's not true.

475
00:35:52.939 --> 00:35:54.009
Here you are.

476
00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.540
Let's see.

477
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.620
This one was born on July 17.

478
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.620
He's 25, so that means he was born in 1993,

479
00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.120
on March 15.

480
00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:11.289
How many other places have you been to?

481
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.190
What do you mean?

482
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.159
They all say they're an okay match, right?

483
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.730
You're the first person I came to.

484
00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:21.929
You don't have a face of a liar.

485
00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:24.240
Stop reading my face, and see if they're a good match.

486
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.120
They're destined to get involved with one another.

487
00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:42.889
Does that mean it's a good match?

488
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.029
But I'm not sure if they'll live together.

489
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.440
You can't say something so irresponsible.

490
00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.600
That's only as far as I can see.

491
00:36:59.539 --> 00:37:01.070
- My goodness. - They seem okay.

492
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:06.549
- What a waste of time. - Watch out for lightning.

493
00:37:06.809 --> 00:37:08.250
- What? - Go.

494
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:09.779
I don't believe this.

495
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.220
- Gosh - My goodness.

496
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:16.190
(Acanthus)

497
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.110
You jerk.

498
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.539
You can never let your aunt rest, can you?

499
00:37:35.669 --> 00:37:36.809
Don't you like it?

500
00:37:38.409 --> 00:37:39.850
What would I like about this?

501
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.809
That role is created just for you, don't you think?

502
00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:45.750
You created this role for me? You?

503
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.419
The writer wants to see you.

504
00:37:48.019 --> 00:37:49.220
I knew it.

505
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.120
You will do it, right?

506
00:37:53.629 --> 00:37:57.230
You know what? You're a real jerk.

507
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.600
Director Shin.

508
00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.879
Director Shin, I found a way.

509
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.149
- What? - Thug One only has...

510
00:38:14.149 --> 00:38:15.909
action scenes without any lines.

511
00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:18.720
He can't play Jin Hee, but he can play Thug One.

512
00:38:19.789 --> 00:38:22.990
Will you be satisfied if Bum Woo only plays deaf mutes forever?

513
00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.220
What kind of nonsense is this?

514
00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:28.429
Go visit Seol Do Hyun.

515
00:38:29.389 --> 00:38:31.059
- What? - And tell him...

516
00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:32.759
that it can't happen no matter what.

517
00:38:36.269 --> 00:38:38.070
No matter what? What can't happen?

518
00:38:41.509 --> 00:38:43.080
What is it?

519
00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.850
My gosh, he never finishes a sentence, does he?

520
00:39:07.669 --> 00:39:10.399
I'm saying we don't need Thug One.

521
00:39:10.399 --> 00:39:12.100
I mean, I'm playing the legendary boss.

522
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.309
Why would I let another actor take the action scene?

523
00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.009
Don't you think so?

524
00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:22.879
Oh, that's hot.

525
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:30.919
Would a legendary boss want to fight against some underlings?

526
00:39:32.059 --> 00:39:36.730
I'm saying I don't have any action scenes in episode one.

527
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.730
I say that I'm a legendary boss,

528
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.029
but I don't show anything.

529
00:39:41.029 --> 00:39:43.940
That's why you have fancy action scenes later on.

530
00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.340
The first episode is the most important for a mini-series.

531
00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.970
As you start the drama,

532
00:39:48.639 --> 00:39:50.840
you need to show something fancy and amazing to...

533
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.980
We're hiding your character behind a veil on episode one.

534
00:39:54.379 --> 00:39:57.549
I know I'm behind a veil, but it's too much.

535
00:39:59.889 --> 00:40:01.720
The director and writer had to rewrite...

536
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.860
episodes 1 and 2 over 5 times.

537
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.419
Please stick to the script.

538
00:40:06.559 --> 00:40:07.559
Excuse me.

539
00:40:08.389 --> 00:40:10.700
- You put too much water in coffee. - Hey.

540
00:40:10.929 --> 00:40:12.899
Ms. Ha. Ms. Ha!

541
00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:17.700
She left.

542
00:40:19.269 --> 00:40:21.070
She's infamous.

543
00:40:21.409 --> 00:40:24.710
She's a legendary lunatic in this industry.

544
00:40:28.809 --> 00:40:30.149
She's got that drive.

545
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:31.820
Right?

546
00:40:44.129 --> 00:40:45.259
Did you do it?

547
00:40:48.129 --> 00:40:50.539
If I didn't, would I dare take your coffee?

548
00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:51.769
What about Bum Woo?

549
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.440
Your arm muscles are the same even after 20 years.

550
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.070
There you go acting cute again.

551
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:35.379
I'm happy to be your wife.

552
00:41:41.789 --> 00:41:42.950
Honey.

553
00:41:44.889 --> 00:41:46.529
Is there anything...

554
00:41:48.759 --> 00:41:50.000
you lied to me about...

555
00:41:50.929 --> 00:41:53.399
while living with me?

556
00:41:58.169 --> 00:42:00.470
What? Did you cheat on me again?

557
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.440
Why are you accusing an innocent person again?

558
00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.809
You tell me ridiculous stuff whenever you cheat on me.

559
00:42:07.779 --> 00:42:09.549
Who is it this time?

560
00:42:09.919 --> 00:42:11.649
So you never lied to me?

561
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.250
You're getting more and more suspicious.

562
00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.830
We have to launch it by any means.

563
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.100
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

564
00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.610
She's from the SBC broadcasting station.

565
00:42:42.879 --> 00:42:44.750
I already made it clear that we weren't interested.

566
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:49.419
Please let me explain to you once more.

567
00:42:49.419 --> 00:42:50.690
I don't have time.

568
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.360
(Juvis Diet)

569
00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.000
You shouldn't do this.

570
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.370
It may symbolize you, Director Jung.

571
00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.980
Please read the script.

572
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.639
I heard the person in charge sent you only the synopsis,

573
00:43:12.639 --> 00:43:13.909
so I brought it.

574
00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:19.019
- Is that how you usually talk? - Pardon?

575
00:43:19.019 --> 00:43:20.490
Were you a soldier before?

576
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:25.490
It happened naturally because I work in a field with a strict hierarchy.

577
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.490
I see that you're very passionate.

578
00:43:28.789 --> 00:43:30.629
I'll review it again.

579
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.340
Thank you.

580
00:43:44.409 --> 00:43:47.210
(Ha Do Na and Song Mi Ja are found to be a child and parent.)

581
00:43:54.789 --> 00:43:57.990
She's the madam's biological daughter.

582
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:10.930
Ma'am, the chairman is home.

583
00:45:16.569 --> 00:45:18.670
What's wrong?

584
00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.170
The chairman doesn't seem to be in a good mood.

585
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:33.720
Honey, is something wrong?

586
00:45:40.359 --> 00:45:42.859
Honey, what happened to your hand?

587
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.349
(Ha Do Na and Song Mi Ja are found to be a child and parent.)

588
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:11.519
Honey.

589
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.869
What are you?

590
00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.900
What...

591
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.640
Who are you?

592
00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:32.140
Honey.

593
00:46:35.009 --> 00:46:38.119
After how much I loved you,

594
00:46:39.519 --> 00:46:41.349
how could you...

595
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.789
You gave birth to another man's child.

596
00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:51.259
And you acted like I was your first love?

597
00:46:51.799 --> 00:46:53.099
Honey.

598
00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.769
That's not true.

599
00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.539
You...

600
00:47:01.009 --> 00:47:02.869
You've never loved me.

601
00:47:03.339 --> 00:47:06.279
You approached me for my money like all the other women.

602
00:47:06.279 --> 00:47:08.480
No, that's not true.

603
00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.880
You know that.

604
00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.150
All your life,

605
00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:14.119
you lived with me with a mask on.

606
00:47:19.259 --> 00:47:20.559
I'm sorry, honey.

607
00:47:24.259 --> 00:47:25.299
You're sorry?

608
00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.299
You're sorry?

609
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.039
Honey.

610
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.769
You... You...

611
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.940
You gave birth to Ha Min Hyuk's daughter?

612
00:47:39.279 --> 00:47:41.210
You, my wife, gave birth...

613
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:42.549
Honey.

614
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:53.089
How could you?

615
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.059
You're my wife. How could you?

616
00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.529
No, honey.

617
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.500
Before I met you...

618
00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.839
Shut your mouth!

619
00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:11.180
I...

620
00:48:12.009 --> 00:48:14.349
I'll think I've never loved you.

621
00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:16.650
Get out.

622
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.680
Get out of my house.

623
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:19.849
Honey.

624
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.559
I...

625
00:48:25.789 --> 00:48:27.329
I can't live...

626
00:48:28.029 --> 00:48:30.099
even a moment with you in this house.

627
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:31.700
So get out.

628
00:48:32.599 --> 00:48:33.730
Honey.

629
00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:37.940
Forgive me.

630
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.170
I'll tell you everything.

631
00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:41.970
I have...

632
00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.779
nothing to say or hear from you.

633
00:48:48.779 --> 00:48:50.680
If you can't leave,

634
00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.119
I will.

635
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.619
Honey.

636
00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.119
Honey.

637
00:48:59.119 --> 00:49:01.160
Honey.

638
00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.200
Honey.

639
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:08.730
Honey.

640
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:15.910
Honey.

641
00:49:27.619 --> 00:49:29.619
The night view is great here.

642
00:49:29.619 --> 00:49:31.519
Our building is famous for the night view.

643
00:49:31.519 --> 00:49:33.890
Exactly. That's why I waited until now...

644
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.359
to see this night view.

645
00:49:38.099 --> 00:49:40.470
I'll keep our night shooting as quiet as possible.

646
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:41.500
Okay.

647
00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.269
Thank you. Goodbye.

648
00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.049
I'm sorry.

649

(Chicken Kalguksu)

650
00:50:05.519 --> 00:50:08.759
Kim Bum Woo... Bum Woo!

651
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.259
Goodness, what?

652
00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.470
What is it?

653
00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:17.299
He's driving me crazy.

654
00:50:18.339 --> 00:50:22.470
It's okay. You're already crazy.

655
00:50:24.579 --> 00:50:26.950
- Goodness, seriously. - Gosh.

656
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:33.049
By the way, you called his name so desperately.

657
00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.990
Do you have romantic feelings towards him?

658
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:39.619
- Goodness. You come over here. - Oh, no.

659
00:50:39.619 --> 00:50:41.690
- You want to die? - What's wrong with you?

660
00:51:11.019 --> 00:51:14.059
Record your life daily life, and send it to my email.

661
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:08.180
What's going on?

662
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:10.420
Dad checked into our hotel's suite.

663
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:12.819
He won't tell me what the problem is.

664
00:52:16.819 --> 00:52:18.289
You don't need to know.

665
00:52:20.759 --> 00:52:22.329
Did you two have a fight?

666
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:24.559
It's not that.

667
00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:26.730
Dad has never acted this way.

668
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.900
What on earth is going on?

669
00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:31.640
Could you leave me alone?

670
00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.769
My wedding is just around the corner.

671
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:35.809
Did you have to cause trouble now?

672
00:52:37.579 --> 00:52:38.839
It's obvious.

673
00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.950
Dad must be acting like that because you caused trouble.

674
00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.950
You make me feel so anxious, and it's killing me.

675
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:07.640
Thank you for making a tough decision.

676
00:53:08.339 --> 00:53:10.839
Ms. Ha's passion changed my mind.

677
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:15.609
We will do our best not to damage...

678
00:53:15.609 --> 00:53:16.950
JU Hotel's public image.

679
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:18.519
Of course.

680
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:20.819
We're investing one third of our publicity budget.

681
00:53:24.289 --> 00:53:26.890
Anyhow, our Lunatic scored big time.

682
00:53:27.289 --> 00:53:29.900
Please don't call me Lunatic, sir.

683
00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:33.029
Why not? I'm calling you that with a lot of affection.

684
00:53:33.029 --> 00:53:34.170
Sir.

685
00:53:34.269 --> 00:53:36.900
Dong Woo, I guess you're a lucky man.

686
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.269
It's hard to get product placement these days,

687
00:53:38.269 --> 00:53:39.970
but Lunatic got you one.

688
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.240
Sir!

689
00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.279
These are divorce papers.

690
00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:58.160
(Divorce Agreement)

691
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.089
The chairman wants to settle it quietly.

692
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:03.829
He's willing to pay you two million dollars as alimony.

693
00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.799
As for the reason of the divorce,

694
00:54:06.599 --> 00:54:08.930
he wants it to be stated as personality difference.

695
00:54:15.009 --> 00:54:17.680
I have to see him. Where is he?

696
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:22.079
He went over to Japan this morning.

697
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.650
You, Mr. Park, are here,

698
00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:25.450
but you're telling me he went to Japan alone?

699
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:28.150
That's absurd.

700
00:54:28.289 --> 00:54:31.089
He ordered me to settle his divorce and left.

701
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.769
Please look through it, and call me.

702
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:43.700
I'll be going now.
