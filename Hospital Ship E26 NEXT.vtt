(Episode 26)

2
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.800
Is it a pneumothorax?

3
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.370
(Pneumothorax, air or gas in the pleural space)

4
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.501
We need to do a thoracentesis.

5
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:22.241
(Thoracentesis, inserting a needle in the chest for treatment purpose)

6
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.031
Ma'am, can you feel this?

7
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.101
Try making fists with your hands.

8
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.300
Please try again.

9
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.810
Can you feel your legs?

10
00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:55.971
Try lifting your legs.

11
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:02.651
How deep was the water?

12
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:04.781
It's certainly over 20m.

13
00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:05.951
How long was she in there?

14
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:07.690
About two hours and a half.

15
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.190
From what I can tell,

16
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.861
she probably has dysbarism rather than an air embolism.

17
00:01:11.861 --> 00:01:14.130
We have to move her for hyperbaric oxygen treatment now.

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.160
(Air embolism, air bubbles blocking a vein or artery)

19
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.261
(Dysbarism, caused by a sudden decrease of pressure)

20
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.100
(Emergency Medical Center)

21
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.300
(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

22
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:06.581
Sell this house?

23
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:09.150
This is your grandma's house.

24
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.090
If you sell it,

25
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:15.550
where would she live?

26
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.321
She can go to a sanatorium.

27
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:19.631
She'll probably die soon anyway.

28
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.530
How could you say that?

29
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.800
Are you praying for her to die?

30
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:27.400
A doctor on the hospital ship who is a total stranger to her...

31
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:29.571
even gave her an enema.

32
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.370
You haven't even held her hand once in 20 years.

33
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.141
How dare you ask me to sell this house?

34
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.020
Where are you going?

35
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.791
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

36
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.661
Can you come with me to the hospital?

37
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:00.400
What do you mean?

38
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:02.270
Choon Soon was in an accident.

39
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.171
I'm too scared to go there by myself.

40
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.340
My husband is out of town right now.

41
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.310
No.

42
00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:12.240
I'm not in the mood for that.

43
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.481
Geun Ja.

44
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.210
It's Geun Hee!

45
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.791
I said Choon Soon was in an accident.

46
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:21.451
She's paralyzed now.

47
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.361
She may not be able to walk again.

48
00:03:24.361 --> 00:03:25.921
What difference does it make if I go?

49
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.761
I'm not a miracle worker.

50
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.400
I can't make her walk again!

51
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.930
You wench.

52
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.470
Choon Soon acted that way...

53
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.571
for a reason.

54
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.470
You're no longer our friend.

55
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.511
I don't want to see you ever again.

56
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.761
(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

57
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.610
- Well? - She's stable.

58
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:24.741
Now, it depends on whether the paralysis goes away.

59
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.610
Patients are usually paralyzed below the spine.

60
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.581
She can't even move her arms.

61
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:31.850
There was a lot of nitrogen in her bloodstream.

62
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.090
Do you think she'll be able to walk again?

63
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.090
We'll have to see.

64
00:06:03.451 --> 00:06:04.980
Are you okay?

65
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:09.860
What?

66
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.720
Can you not walk?

67
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:16.230
Can you no longer walk?

68
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.071
Doctor.

69
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.141
On Ja.

70
00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:42.121
Wait.

71
00:06:43.561 --> 00:06:46.530
Yes. I'm okay.

72
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.561
Oh dear. My dear Choon Soon.

73
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:54.230
You poor thing, Choon Soon.

74
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.301
You're okay now.

75
00:06:57.301 --> 00:06:59.400
Choon Soon.

76
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:06.610
Oh dear...

77
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.751
Oh dear...

78
00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:26.730
- That was so very dramatic. - It was.

79
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:30.441
I'm so glad she's able to walk again.

80
00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:34.270
This is why we became doctors, isn't it?

81
00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:40.350
Well done saving the patient.

82
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.381
- Let's go. - Where?

83
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.451
This is really upsetting.

84
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:52.020
You said you'd buy dinner and you forgot?

85
00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:55.691
- Oh, I... - Is it on or not?

86
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.600
Will you join us?

87
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:03.540
You haven't eaten, have you? Come with us.

88
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.311
Doctor Song's treat. She'll tell stories too.

89
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.910
Do you mind if he comes?

90
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.520
No. I think we should go alone.

91
00:08:22.051 --> 00:08:23.191
Too bad.

92
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:26.561
You should get going then.

93
00:08:26.561 --> 00:08:27.860
I have plans.

94
00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:31.030
How will you get there?

95
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.600
I'll drive you to wherever we can.

96
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.771
No, I don't have to go far. I can walk.

97
00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:40.710
Enjoy your dinner.

98
00:09:03.701 --> 00:09:06.161
- Where are we going? - Somewhere nice.

99
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.340
You said we'd go somewhere nice, and you bring me here?

100
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.311
Do you not want to eat here?

101
00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:57.720
You like this place.

102
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.720
Can I order something expensive?

103
00:10:09.701 --> 00:10:10.901
What do you like?

104
00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:20.110
- I'll take you to the airport. - I prefer it this way.

105
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.740
Are you sure you don't want to see Doctor Go?

106
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.041
I prefer Sewoon Hospital.

107
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.110
My dad's brother arranged to have me admitted.

108
00:10:28.311 --> 00:10:30.980
He's in a different department, but my mom's brother works there.

109
00:10:32.921 --> 00:10:34.021
Okay, then.

110
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.791
Who'll meet you at the airport?

111
00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:39.490
Jeong Rim.

112
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.600
I'll call you when I settle into my hospital room.

113
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.720
What... What's this?

114
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.561
Young Eun's in Geoje Island?

115
00:11:31.781 --> 00:11:33.081
Yes, Mom.

116
00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:35.010
"Yes, Mom"?

117
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.951
Is something wrong?

118
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.720
Something's wrong with you, not me.

119
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:44.260
Why is Young Eun there?

120
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.431
"Hospital ship, Geoje."

121
00:11:48.431 --> 00:11:50.801
"Drawings full of humanism"?

122
00:11:50.801 --> 00:11:53.500
Do you think this suits her at all?

123
00:11:53.701 --> 00:11:56.500
- Mom. - What's she doing there?

124
00:11:58.171 --> 00:12:00.870
Why do I even ask? The answer's obvious.

125
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:03.240
Is she clinging onto you?

126
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.541
And you took her back again like a fool?

127
00:12:05.541 --> 00:12:07.081
It's not like that.

128
00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:09.850
Then send her off to Seoul right now.

129
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.551
Why won't you answer? Are you getting second thoughts?

130
00:12:16.821 --> 00:12:19.960
This is why I call you a fool.

131
00:12:20.161 --> 00:12:21.630
If you can't, I will.

132
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.130
I will make sure she stays away from you for good this time.

133
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.801
- You can't. - I can't? Why can't I?

134
00:12:28.201 --> 00:12:30.571
Did you give into her already?

135
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:32.340
She's sick.

136
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.510
Is she really? What's wrong with her?

137
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.010
Is she dying of something?

138
00:12:40.681 --> 00:12:42.581
She has leukemia.

139
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.521
What? She has what?

140
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.850
So...

141
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.021
Isn't it a lie?

142
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:52.990
Mom.

143
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.531
That's even more reason to let her go.

144
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.901
She broke your heart so many times in the past.

145
00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:00.901
Do you want to nurse her too?

146
00:13:00.901 --> 00:13:04.301
Pretend you don't know for now. I have to go.

147
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.110
Is it true?

148
00:13:17.521 --> 00:13:19.350
Aren't you Young Eun?

149
00:13:19.651 --> 00:13:22.390
What are you doing here?

150
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.460
Are you sick?

151
00:13:24.561 --> 00:13:26.691
No, yes, well...

152
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.960
Are you sick or are you not?

153
00:13:31.161 --> 00:13:33.600
I have to go. I'm busy.

154
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.470
Was that why she was so flustered?

00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:05.860
What a mess.

157
00:14:06.271 --> 00:14:09.271
- Who do you mean? - My brother's ex.

158
00:14:09.271 --> 00:14:11.571
She's too old to be doing that.

159
00:14:12.171 --> 00:14:15.171
Is it okay for someone who's attached to be here?

160
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.610
My engagement's still two weeks away.

161
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.480
I'm not yet attached.

162
00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:33.291
What? You saw whom at the club?

163
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.860
Choi Young Eun. Don't you know who that is?

164
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.301
Do you think I'm senile? Of course, I know who she is.

166
00:14:47.671 --> 00:14:50.880
Hyun, guess whom I saw at the club tonight.

She was there too,

169
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.620
and she's complaining her fiance was there.

170
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.651
Mom.

171
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.490
Okay, I'll put her back on.

172
00:15:09.331 --> 00:15:12.130
- Don't you dare tell him. - Why not?

173
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.130
Do as I say before I give you half the dowry.

174
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.271
Okay?

175
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.541
Okay. Just give me my phone.

176
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.590
That idiot. He's more than just an idiot.

177
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.561
I can't believe he's my son.

178
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.291
My goodness.

179
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.990
Come over so we can visit Dad.

180
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:44.000
Bring your fiance.

181
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.531
- Are you crazy? - Ji Eun.

182
00:15:46.901 --> 00:15:49.201
When will you stop caring for him?

183
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.970
I'm doing this for you, not for Dad.

184
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.870
I want you to be happy.

185
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.640
How long do you think the lie will last?

186
00:15:57.941 --> 00:15:59.850
You're marrying him for love.

187
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:02.911
You should be honest with him, then.

188
00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.720
Only then can he return the favor.

189
00:16:08.521 --> 00:16:09.620
Ji Eun.

190
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.620
I'll think about it.

191
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.710
There.

192
00:16:35.181 --> 00:16:37.480
Now, let's get to the point.

193
00:16:38.951 --> 00:16:42.620
You spared me some of your very precious time...

194
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.661
and offered to buy me dinner.

195
00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:48.760
That means you have an announcement. Am I wrong?

196
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.061
You're right.

197
00:16:50.701 --> 00:16:53.130
What is it? A proposal?

198
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:54.771
How did you know?

199
00:17:03.711 --> 00:17:05.211
So this is how it feels.

200
00:17:06.551 --> 00:17:09.081
I knew it was a joke, and yet...

201
00:17:09.251 --> 00:17:10.920
my heart pounded fast.

202
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.491
This part of me has been acting weirdly lately.

203
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.390
I like Geoje Jeil Hospital very much.

204
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:23.660
I want to own it.

205
00:17:24.061 --> 00:17:26.670
What I want even more than the hospital...

206
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.370
is your mom.

207
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.870
If I could, I'd like to make...

208
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.071
your mom mine, but...

209
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.150
But not you.

210
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.581
In order to marry someone, you need to love the person.

211
00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:46.620
But I...

212
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.420
don't have any intention to do so. I'm...

213
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.860
Don't apologize.

214
00:17:53.261 --> 00:17:56.360
It's too early to say you're sorry.

215
00:17:59.561 --> 00:18:02.531
Do you have no intention of loving me,

216
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.840
or do you not care for love in general?

217
00:18:11.711 --> 00:18:13.011
Which is it?

218
00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:50.450
Both.

219
00:18:52.251 --> 00:18:54.190
I don't care about love,

220
00:18:54.521 --> 00:18:55.950
but even if I changed,

221
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.660
I wouldn't feel anything for you.

222
00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.491
How can you be so sure?

223
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.630
You sound like a surgeon with a perfect protocol.

224
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.130
How can you be so sure...

225
00:19:10.271 --> 00:19:12.370
I'm not the one?

226
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:16.440
Tell me.

227
00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:19.950
What's this based on?

228
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.420
Go on.

229
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.430
Do you not know?

230
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.930
Shall I tell you?

231
00:19:41.331 --> 00:19:43.370
It's because you love someone else.

232
00:19:47.471 --> 00:19:49.610
You know who that is.

233
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.051
That's why you're so sure I'm not the one.

234
00:19:58.321 --> 00:20:01.150
Who is it? Kwak Hyun?

235
00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.660
No. It's not him.

236
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.231
Don't turn away. Look at me.

237
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.031
Look straight at me, and say it.

238
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.670
- Is it really not him? - No.

239
00:20:22.311 --> 00:20:24.440
What on earth is he, then?

240
00:20:25.211 --> 00:20:27.380
What does he mean to you?

241
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.150
A colleague and friend.

242
00:20:29.511 --> 00:20:31.420
"A colleague and friend"?

243
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.721
Why won't you tell him Ms. Choi isn't sick?

244
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.590
You should if he's your friend. Why?

245
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.860
You wouldn't want a friend to be duped.

246
00:20:44.231 --> 00:20:47.430
Or end up ruining his life because of a witch.

247
00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.640
But still, you have...

248
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.670
no intention of telling him.

249
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.741
- That's... - Because...

250
00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.450
you don't want him to feel ashamed?

251
00:21:06.081 --> 00:21:07.291
No.

252
00:21:11.491 --> 00:21:14.531
You don't want to look like a jealous woman.

253
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.130
You don't want the man you like...

254
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.331
to think less of you.

255
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.840
You're making that face, and you say he's a colleague?

256
00:21:39.321 --> 00:21:40.721
I think...

257
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.761
what you're doing to him...

258
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.600
is worse than what you're doing to me.

259
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.991
You idiot. Why did you...

260
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.561
Why did you say that?

261
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:27.930
I don't get it. Why did you tell her that?

262
00:23:56.961 --> 00:23:58.321
(Fractured hip)

263
00:24:09.271 --> 00:24:10.271
Hello, sir.

264
00:24:10.471 --> 00:24:12.340
This is Dr. Kwak Hyun from the hospital ship.

265
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.541
Do you have a fever?

266
00:24:16.511 --> 00:24:17.581
Okay.

267
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.850
Please call me if you have any problems.

268
00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:35.531
Is this the daughter of Mo Mak Jeom?

269
00:24:36.461 --> 00:24:38.660
How are you feeling? Do you have a fever?

270
00:24:40.531 --> 00:24:41.600
No.

271
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:43.741
After taking some medicine,

272
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.940
I feel better.

273
00:24:48.011 --> 00:24:49.170
I still...

274
00:24:49.981 --> 00:24:51.380
have the flu.

275
00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.110
Did your mother take an enema?

276
00:24:57.721 --> 00:24:58.781
I see.

277
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.950
If she has any problems, don't hesitate to call me.

278
00:25:04.221 --> 00:25:06.761
No, you can call anytime.

279
00:25:08.231 --> 00:25:09.261
Okay.

280
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.961
You can call this number.

281
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.571
Okay, goodbye.

282
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.370
(Mo Mak Jeom)

283
00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.491
Work is over.

284
00:25:45.031 --> 00:25:46.670
What are you doing?

285
00:25:47.231 --> 00:25:48.870
I have some extra time.

286
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.640
I'll go visit Ms. Mo.

287
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.700
She needs to take an enema.

288
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.771
I'm worried she has bedsores.

289
00:25:55.541 --> 00:25:56.910
Her daughter is with her.

290
00:25:57.481 --> 00:25:59.781
When there's no one, you can take care of her but...

291
00:26:00.251 --> 00:26:02.781
Bedsores aren't easy to take care of.

292
00:26:03.481 --> 00:26:05.880
Besides, she didn't pick up the phone since yesterday.

293
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.221
You forgot to take some gauze.

294
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.791
I'll get it. I'll come with you.

295
00:26:15.231 --> 00:26:16.231
Seriously?

296
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.731
You're acting like Doctor Schweitzer.

297
00:26:20.031 --> 00:26:23.541
I should act like Nightingale.

298
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.241
I'll bring it.

299
00:26:34.511 --> 00:26:36.751
- Hello. - Hello.

300
00:26:36.821 --> 00:26:37.920
How have you been?

301
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.390
How is Ms. Mo?

302
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:43.690
Who are you?

303
00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:47.930
Remember me? I'm the doctor from the hospital ship.

304
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:50.031
Do you...

305
00:26:50.561 --> 00:26:51.561
know me?

306
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.731
- Ma'am. - Let go of me.

307
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:03.581
Doctor.

308
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.380
What's going on?

309
00:27:09.721 --> 00:27:11.051
Geun Ja.

310
00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.461
Goodness.

311
00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.221
What's going on?

312
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:20.961
Hey.

313
00:27:21.261 --> 00:27:23.160
- Geun Ja... - Ma'am.

314
00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:25.031
Who are you?

315
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.271
How do you...

316
00:27:27.971 --> 00:27:29.400
know my name?

317
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.971
Do you have Alzheimer's?

318
00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.041
You have a sick mother. What is going on?

319
00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:37.610
Goodness.

320
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:38.910
- Ma'am. - Geun Ja.

321
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:39.910
Ma'am?

322
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:40.910
- Ma'am? - Geun Ja.

323
00:27:41.281 --> 00:27:42.281
Ma'am.

324
00:28:19.581 --> 00:28:20.850
(Hospital Ship)

325
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.991
For the hospital ship's family...

326
00:28:22.991 --> 00:28:24.190
- Cheers. - Cheers.

327
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.061
He traveled all his life without a home.

328
00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.261
This is how he passes away.

329
00:28:29.561 --> 00:28:32.001
Patient Choi Young Eun at hematology-oncology.

330
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.930
She wasn't admitted to the hospital?

331
00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:36.801
What a fancy ceremony.

332
00:28:37.541 --> 00:28:38.900
Near Jangseungpo Port,

333
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.741
a Chinese boat...

334
00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:43.311
What's going on?
