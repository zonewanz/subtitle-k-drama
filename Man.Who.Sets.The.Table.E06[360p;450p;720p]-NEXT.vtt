1
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.125
Thank you.

2
00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:10.293
(Episode 6)

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.390
I heard that this place is the hottest 
place in Seoul these days.

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.896
Let's eat find out why it's so popular.

5
00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:18.068
But it looks pretty expensive.

6
00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:19.202
You're the one buying.

7
00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:20.704
You got paid today.

8
00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:21.805
Me?

9
00:00:22.973 --> 00:00:26.076
You're so naive. I'm just kidding.

10
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.012
Is teasing me the only 
entertainment in your life?

11
00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:30.347
How did you know?

12
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.685
Today's a lucky day. Let's toast.

13
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.755
Of course with non-alcohol champagne.

14
00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:43.560
Do you still remember that 
I'm allergic to alcohol?

15
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.729
How could I forget the flaming sea squirt?

16
00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:46.897
Here.

17
00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:49.766
Thank you.

18
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.903
Fill it up. I'm going 
to drink for four people.

19
00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:56.073
- Hello. You can give me the key. 
- Hi.

20
00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.274
Thank you.

21
00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.577
I heard that this place is pretty hot.

22
00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:03.680
That's why there are many 
young people here.

23
00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:07.084
Let's go on a date since it's been a while.

24
00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:10.353
Let's go in.

25
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.466
Excuse me.

26
00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:24.868
Hello?

27
00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:28.738
- We need a table for two.
 - Follow me, please.

28
00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:40.250
Why are you here?

29
00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:48.658
You should be in Guam, 
but why are you here?

30
00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:52.662
Hello, how have you been?

31
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.866
- Who is he? 
- There's no need to greet him.

32
00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.068
He's the guy I told you about.

33
00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:00.103
He toyed with our Ru Ri.

34
00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:04.274
Tell me the truth.

35
00:02:04.474 --> 00:02:07.611
Did you come to Korea because of Ru Ri?

36
00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.580
- I have some business to do. - Anyway,

37
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:15.585
if you plan to seduce
 Ru Ri while you're here,

38
00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:18.255
you'll have to forget about it. 
Did you hear me?

39
00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:22.826
If I see you around Ru Ri again,

40
00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:25.996
I'm going to break you to pieces.

41
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.073
I'm warning you.

42
00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:41.311
Ru Ri is going to marry a good person.

43
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:42.512
I don't want you near her.

44
00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:44.548
Don't pretend that you know her,

45
00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:46.383
don't even look at her,

46
00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:48.952
and erase her from your memory completely.

47
00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:51.655
- Do you understand? - Sir...

48
00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:53.056
Do you understand or not?

49
00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:01.097
I told you in Guam.

50
00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:09.673
I've been at construction 
sites all around the world.

51
00:03:09.673 --> 00:03:10.907
Please, just this one time.

52
00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.543
The Great Man-Made River of Libya...

53
00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:16.646
Honey, let's just go to our seats.

54
00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:20.850
I warned you. Remember that.

55
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.454
I'm sorry. Please enjoy your meal.

56
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:25.956
You're wicked.

57
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.227
Honey, let's have a seat over there.

58
00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:32.729
Why go to the corner when
 we can sit next to the window?

59
00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.898
It's cozier over there.

60
00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:36.433
- Let's go. - Okay.

61
00:03:38.702 --> 00:03:41.471
- Go to the bathroom. - The bathroom? Okay.

62
00:03:50.113 --> 00:03:52.582
What should we order?

63
00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:54.251
Wait a minute.

64
00:03:54.618 --> 00:03:56.419
I'll go to the bathroom and wash my hands.

65
00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.222
Honey, I have wet wipes.

66
00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:02.592
That's okay. I need to go to 
the bathroom anyway.

67
00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:03.927
Honey.

68
00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:17.974
- Mom. - Dad's going to the bathroom.

69
00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:19.042
What?

70
00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:44.668
Is someone in there?

71
00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:46.970
Is someone using the bathroom?

72
00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:50.373
Why is there no answer?

73
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:52.309
Excuse me?

74
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:54.978
Excuse me?

75
00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:03.820
What's taking them so long?

76
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.859
Mom, save me. I'm stuck in the men's bathroom.

77
00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:11.294
Oh, my.

78
00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:14.230
Where is Ru Ri?

79
00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.569
(Mom, save me. I'm stuck in the men's bathroom.)

80
00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:22.072
What should we do?

81
00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:30.547
I'll take care of it.

82
00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:33.750
Is someone in there?

83
00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:37.120
Is someone using the bathroom?

84
00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:39.489
Yes?

85
00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:42.792
What is wrong? Is the door locked?

86
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.230
Excuse me. Open the door.

87
00:05:48.665 --> 00:05:49.733
Excuse me.

88
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.068
Gosh.

89
00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:54.170
My bladder is about to burst.

90
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.238
- Oh, my. - Sir,

91
00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.875
I'm sorry, but it's out of order.

92
00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:01.411
If you're urgent, please use the women's bathroom.

93
00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:04.981
What? You should've written something on it then.

94
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.249
Is no one in there?

95
00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:07.317
Yes.

96
00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:15.125
Thank you.

97
00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:19.462
Hurry up and come out.

98
00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:24.868
What about dad?

99
00:06:24.868 --> 00:06:25.902
Hurry up.

100
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:30.039
- Mom. - Hurry up and go.

101
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.477
What?

102
00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:37.747
Why are you here?

103
00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:43.420
I wanted to wash my hands too.

104
00:06:44.354 --> 00:06:45.822
- Hurry up. - Okay.

105
00:06:46.723 --> 00:06:49.626
Goodness, how can they treat customers like this?

106
00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:54.297
(Valet parking)

107
00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.535
- My car is 5700. - 5700? Okay.

108
00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.607
You must be very surprised. Are you okay?

109
00:07:04.607 --> 00:07:05.675
Yes.

110
00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:18.054
I understand.

111
00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:20.623
I'll take my time.

112
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:30.733
Honey, we should order something.

113
00:07:31.568 --> 00:07:33.436
Let's leave. I can't eat here.

114
00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:36.306
Why? I'm hungry.

115
00:07:36.306 --> 00:07:38.741
You can tell the quality of this restaurant by the bathroom.

116
00:07:38.808 --> 00:07:40.610
They didn't even notice an out of order bathroom to the customers.

117
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.111
It's even expensive.

118
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:44.380
I know a good suyuk place. Let's go.

119
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.682
Honey.

120
00:07:46.683 --> 00:07:47.750
Honey.

121
00:07:48.852 --> 00:07:50.920
Honey, honey.

122
00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:53.857
Let's just eat here. I'm hungry.

123
00:07:53.857 --> 00:07:55.859
Wait here. I'll get the car quickly.

124
00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:57.727
- Goodness. - Manager Jung, what should we do?

125
00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.063
- I'll get the car. - Oh, my.

126
00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:11.474
Look at that scoundrel.

127
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.810
It hasn't been long since he broke up with Ru Ri.

128
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.745
He's already meeting someone new.

129
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.748
Honey, let's just go inside.

130
00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:20.984
Wait a minute.

131
00:08:21.484 --> 00:08:23.620
Why is that woman like that?

132
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.558
Her physique looks...

133
00:08:29.359 --> 00:08:30.660
like Ru Ri.

134
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.630
What are you talking about?

135
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.665
She's on a blind date right now.

136
00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:37.100
Honey, let's go inside.

137
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.568
Wait a minute.

138
00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:43.139
She's also really tall.

139
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:45.942
That's really suspicious.

140
00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:48.044
- Isn't it? - Honey.

141
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:50.046
- Why? - Honey.

142
00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:52.315
Wait a minute. Wait here.

143
00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:58.388
What should we do? I think he's coming here.

144
00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:03.393
Hey, Guam. Look at me.

145
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.395
Hey, Guam.

146
00:09:05.395 --> 00:09:06.663
Honey.

147
00:09:06.663 --> 00:09:08.831
What is he doing? Wait a minute.

148
00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:10.066
It's an order. Stay still.

149
00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:11.334
Manager Jung.

150
00:09:11.568 --> 00:09:13.770
Hey.

151
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.837
We have no choice.

152
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.906
Let's just tell him.

153
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.575
We can't do that.

154
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.945
Sir.

155
00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:24.080
Honey.

156
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.448
- Look at him. - Here's your car.

157
00:09:28.418 --> 00:09:32.155
Wait a minute. What is wrong with you?

158
00:09:33.056 --> 00:09:34.390
My car is here.

159
00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:35.592
What?

160
00:09:35.692 --> 00:09:38.962
Hey, wait a minute.

161
00:09:38.962 --> 00:09:42.098
Hey, stop. Stop.

162
00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:46.669
What is he doing?

163
00:09:47.804 --> 00:09:50.640
Please check the back. Is he following us?

164
00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.812
Relax, no one's behind us.

165
00:09:55.912 --> 00:09:57.046
Really?

166
00:10:12.929 --> 00:10:13.930
Are you okay?

167
00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:27.310
What should I do?

168
00:10:33.783 --> 00:10:35.551
- Yes, Dad. - Where are you right now?

169
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:37.453
Right now?

170
00:10:37.453 --> 00:10:38.554
Yes.

171
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:40.390
Who are you with?

172
00:10:40.423 --> 00:10:44.560
I just parted with my blind date.

173
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.962
I'm going to take the subway.

174
00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:47.430
Really?

175
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.399
How was your blind date?

176
00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:51.167
Did he ask you out on a date?

177
00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:55.438
I'm not sure right now.

178
00:10:55.438 --> 00:10:57.407
I'll tell you when I get home.

179
00:10:57.407 --> 00:11:00.176
Okay. It's late, so hurry up and come home.

180
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.680
Maybe it wasn't Ru Ri.

181
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.784
See? You were over reacting.

182
00:11:07.817 --> 00:11:09.585
Stop being so suspicious.

183
00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:11.888
She's really eccentric.

184
00:11:11.888 --> 00:11:14.691
It must be the end of the world.

185
00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:16.759
My daughter has been living with a man.

186
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.596
Anyway, I can't relax...

187
00:11:21.164 --> 00:11:22.832
as long as he's living in Seoul.

188
00:11:30.807 --> 00:11:32.075
Don't you know yet?

189
00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:34.677
Don't you know why I'm participating in the menu development contest?

190
00:11:34.677 --> 00:11:37.413
You said you weren't interested when you were in Guam.

191
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.416
I was wrong, so I came back.

192
00:11:40.516 --> 00:11:45.154
Don't you ever think about meeting that scoundrel again.

193
00:11:53.096 --> 00:11:54.464
Why are you outside?

194
00:11:55.598 --> 00:11:58.901
I'm sorry, but let's just celebrate with this.

195
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:00.002
You should be hungry.

196
00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:01.938
Manager Jung.

197
00:12:02.038 --> 00:12:05.508
You told me to answer after we're done eating.

198
00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:08.945
I'll answer you right now.

199
00:12:12.682 --> 00:12:15.885
I nearly had a heart attack...

200
00:12:16.052 --> 00:12:18.521
when I met my father today.

201
00:12:18.755 --> 00:12:20.289
That's why I decided.

202
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.560
The contest doesn't matter. I'm not going to see you again.

203
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.661
I'm serious.

204
00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:27.830
I can walk home.

205
00:12:28.297 --> 00:12:30.666
Please go before my dad sees you again.

206
00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:33.936
Are you going to marry a suitable person your dad picks for you?

207
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.572
Is that the life you really want?

208
00:12:37.073 --> 00:12:39.342
He'll eventually find out about us.

209
00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.911
If he finds out that we keep meeting like this, we'll be in trouble.

210
00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:43.946
Did you forget why you ran away to Guam?

211
00:12:44.914 --> 00:12:47.049
You said you wanted to be honest to yourself,

212
00:12:47.817 --> 00:12:49.552
and not become someone's puppet.

213
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.422
What you want, how you want to live,

214
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.892
and who you want to be with.

215
00:12:56.659 --> 00:12:57.693
You wanted to find yourself.

216
00:12:57.693 --> 00:13:00.763
I'm not confident.

217
00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:03.933
You saw how it is with my dad.

218
00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:07.069
My dad never gives up if he sets his mind on it.

219
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.805
It's impossible...

220
00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:10.807
to disobey my dad.

221
00:13:11.841 --> 00:13:12.842
I...

222
00:13:13.576 --> 00:13:16.279
don't want to be a bad daughter because of love.

223
00:13:20.683 --> 00:13:21.717
I also thought...

224
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:28.457
it was impossible to meet someone who makes my heart race.

225
00:13:29.826 --> 00:13:32.562
But I'm here because I was wrong.

226
00:13:33.596 --> 00:13:36.232
Nothing's impossible.

227
00:13:36.532 --> 00:13:38.668
It's impossible because they give up.

228
00:13:45.942 --> 00:13:47.043
I already told you.

229
00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:49.345
I'm going to take my time.

230
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:53.316
You do what your heart tells you. Just slowly follow me.

231
00:14:05.161 --> 00:14:06.262
It's on Friday.

232
00:14:06.662 --> 00:14:08.431
We're going to practice here for the final stage of the contest.

233
00:14:08.664 --> 00:14:09.799
I'll wait for you.

234
00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:13.669
Don't forget this.

235
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.002
What are you doing?

236
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:48.304
This is prenatal education.

237
00:14:48.571 --> 00:14:49.639
Prenatal education?

238
00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:52.174
I want our baby...

239
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:55.177
to be smart just like you, so I'm making our baby study English.

240
00:14:58.547 --> 00:14:59.815
The baby can't hear this yet.

241
00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:03.586
It has to be at least three months for the fetus to hear this.

242
00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:06.455
So for now, make sure you take folic acid pills.

243
00:15:10.526 --> 00:15:11.594
Why are you looking at me like that?

244
00:15:11.594 --> 00:15:12.962
Because you're so hot.

245
00:15:13.362 --> 00:15:15.431
Honey, why are you so smart?

246
00:15:16.032 --> 00:15:17.533
You know everything.

247
00:15:18.534 --> 00:15:20.002
Everything about me impresses you, doesn't it?

248
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:22.204
This is basic knowledge for doctors.

249
00:15:24.307 --> 00:15:25.541
I can't believe this.

250
00:15:26.075 --> 00:15:28.678
That even a delinquent like me can be a mother.

251
00:15:30.446 --> 00:15:33.783
How should I put it? It feels like someone gave me a gift.

252
00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:38.287
A gift better than 100 designer bags.

253
00:15:39.455 --> 00:15:41.390
I'm so happy.

254
00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:44.193
Sure. Let's think of it as a gift.

255
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.064
A precious gift the universe has given us,

256
00:15:48.798 --> 00:15:50.066
so we can live a happy life.

257
00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:03.412
I know what it is. Do you want me to tell you the truth?

258
00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:07.950
In what year were you born?

259
00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:18.260
Hey! Give back my bread!

260
00:16:33.676 --> 00:16:36.145
- What should I wear? - Mom, So Won is going to work.

261
00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:37.680
Mother, I'm off.

262
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.183
Why are you going to work on a day like this?

263
00:16:41.183 --> 00:16:44.453
I'm going to take her to a gynecologist...

264
00:16:44.453 --> 00:16:46.155
to scan for an ultrasound.

265
00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:49.258
How can a father not accompany her?

266
00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:51.460
I'm sorry. I have a surgery scheduled this morning.

267
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.563
Mom, if you keep nagging him when he goes to work,

268
00:16:54.563 --> 00:16:56.665
- we're going to move out. - Stop it.

269
00:16:57.199 --> 00:16:58.834
Let's have lunch afterward instead.

270
00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:01.037
I want to see how our baby looks like.

271
00:17:01.037 --> 00:17:03.806
I bet our baby takes after you, and is very handsome.

272
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.042
How many times have I told you?

273
00:17:06.342 --> 00:17:10.880
Having a handsome face won't do your husband any good.

274
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.816
You know what? I bet he might kick away all the good fortunes.

275
00:17:13.816 --> 00:17:14.884
No way.

276
00:17:14.884 --> 00:17:17.520
I have a competent mother and an adorable wife.

277
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.156
And now, I'll have a baby who takes after me.

278
00:17:21.257 --> 00:17:23.826
Don't you think that I'm quite lucky?

279
00:17:27.063 --> 00:17:28.631
Goodness.

280
00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:31.133
You were always negative about me and didn't accept me.

281
00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:33.102
How can you imitate me that well?

282
00:17:33.102 --> 00:17:34.904
Oh, my. I'm so happy.

283
00:17:34.904 --> 00:17:38.240
Let's live like this sharing things to laugh about.

284
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.475
Okay, Mother.

285
00:17:42.912 --> 00:17:46.715
If you go outside one more time, I won't come to see you.

286
00:17:47.016 --> 00:17:48.317
Did you get it or not?

287
00:17:50.586 --> 00:17:51.754
Be quiet!

288
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:53.956
Between the thighs and pelvic bones...

289
00:17:53.956 --> 00:17:55.224
I'm tired of this.

290
00:17:55.791 --> 00:17:58.594
This is usually seen around the hip joint.

291
00:17:59.061 --> 00:18:02.131
This is common to patients over 70 who suffer from osteoporosis.

292
00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:05.134
The main reason of the fracture is falling.

293
00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:12.408
This is found a lot among elderlies.

294
00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:15.544
For men, this happens frequently when they reach 65.

295
00:18:15.544 --> 00:18:16.879
"First Lieutenant Lee So Won."

296
00:18:16.879 --> 00:18:19.682
- For women, 15 percent... - This is the guy.

297
00:18:20.116 --> 00:18:23.486
Annually, this happens to 20,000 patients in our country.

298
00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.788
When did you have your last period?

299
00:18:26.722 --> 00:18:29.525
You don't need to ask any questions.

300
00:18:29.592 --> 00:18:32.061
She's 100 percent pregnant.

301
00:18:32.294 --> 00:18:33.963
You know the domestic pregnancy tests?

302
00:18:33.963 --> 00:18:37.099
We ran the test 2, no. We ran it 3 times.

303
00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:40.369
And there were two strikes on them.

304
00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:42.705
- Mom. - There were two strikes.

305
00:18:44.306 --> 00:18:45.941
There were two lines.

306
00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:48.010
That was a joke.

307
00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:52.014
I feel nauseated.

308
00:18:52.348 --> 00:18:53.782
I get morning sickness too.

309
00:18:53.782 --> 00:18:56.485
She vomited twice.

310
00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.822
Then shall we proceed with the ultrasound first?

311
00:19:00.156 --> 00:19:01.290
Yes, please.

312
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.825
(Orthopedist Lee So Won)

313
00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:13.269
Doctor, we have a situation. Please come out.

314
00:19:13.335 --> 00:19:15.337
- What is it? - You must hurry.

315
00:19:15.337 --> 00:19:16.906
We have a situation.

316
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.646
- What's going on? - Well...

317
00:19:29.151 --> 00:19:31.620
Who is this kid? Why is she here?

318
00:19:35.357 --> 00:19:37.092
(Blocked Caller ID)

319
00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:41.830
- Yes? - Mr. Lee So Won.

320
00:19:42.131 --> 00:19:43.265
That's your name, isn't it?

321
00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:45.501
Yes, it is. Who is calling?

322
00:19:46.569 --> 00:19:48.003
Please take good care of her.

323
00:19:48.003 --> 00:19:50.739
You have the duty to take care of her.

324
00:19:51.073 --> 00:19:53.642
Who are you, and who is this kid?

325
00:19:53.642 --> 00:19:55.811
Take care of her as you repent on your wrongdoings.

326
00:19:56.245 --> 00:19:57.780
Don't even think about calling the cops.

327
00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.948
What?

328
00:19:59.315 --> 00:20:01.717
Hey, hey. Who are you? Hey!

329
00:20:02.651 --> 00:20:04.887
Doctor, we should notify the police first, right?

330
00:20:04.887 --> 00:20:05.988
Hold on.

331
00:20:21.904 --> 00:20:23.272
This is strange.

332
00:20:23.372 --> 00:20:24.540
What is it, Doctor?

333
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.643
- Is there something wrong? - Let's run a blood test.

334
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:29.812
Sure.

335
00:20:42.291 --> 00:20:43.592
How is she?

336
00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:45.060
Do you think it's child abuse?

337
00:20:47.463 --> 00:20:49.798
As there are no wounds, she must have been neglected.

338
00:20:50.266 --> 00:20:52.901
She's suffering from malnutrition. Let's take care of her first.

339
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:54.103
I'm relieved.

340
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.772
Who are her parents thought?

341
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.243
Kid, what is your name?

342
00:21:02.911 --> 00:21:04.480
Who brought you here?

343
00:21:07.316 --> 00:21:10.319
You have to answer me if you want to go back home.

344
00:21:11.086 --> 00:21:12.521
You know where you live, don't you?

345
00:21:13.822 --> 00:21:15.658
Do you remember your mom's phone number or name?

346
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.239
Someone was trying to find out information on me.

347
00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:31.407
So I dug up a little.

348
00:21:31.407 --> 00:21:32.541
But...

349
00:21:33.342 --> 00:21:36.345
they weren't interested about me.

350
00:21:36.612 --> 00:21:38.981
It was about you, so be careful.

351
00:21:44.453 --> 00:21:45.554
Goodness.

352
00:21:46.755 --> 00:21:48.524
You startled me.

353
00:21:48.524 --> 00:21:50.459
What were you thinking about? Why were you so surprised?

354
00:21:50.459 --> 00:21:53.362
No, I wasn't thinking about anything.

355
00:21:54.363 --> 00:21:57.533
Hold on. This is about Choi Sun Young, isn't it?

356
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.302
You've been thinking a lot after her visit.

357
00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:04.139
Don't.

358
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.241
I'm going to protect...

359
00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:08.644
you and our children, so she can't lay a finger on you guys.

360
00:22:09.144 --> 00:22:11.580
I just want you to be happy just like before.

361
00:22:11.847 --> 00:22:12.948
Okay?

362
00:22:14.249 --> 00:22:15.517
I will.

363
00:22:16.285 --> 00:22:18.020
I went through so much to be happy.

364
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.422
- I must be. - All right.

365
00:22:26.795 --> 00:22:27.996
Gosh, he startled me.

366
00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:30.799
I think I know why the kids are coming home late.

367
00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:34.303
You're filming a movie and flirting whenever you get a chance.

368
00:22:34.303 --> 00:22:36.372
Hey, watch it. Don't get smart with me. I'm your dad.

369
00:22:36.372 --> 00:22:38.006
I heard the contest went well.

370
00:22:39.208 --> 00:22:42.111
Oh, no. How did you hurt your hand?

371
00:22:42.111 --> 00:22:44.780
This? I fell from the stairs in the building the contest was held.

372
00:22:44.947 --> 00:22:47.015
- How did that happen? - Something is fishy about that.

373
00:22:47.316 --> 00:22:49.084
I think someone pushed me down the stairs.

374
00:22:53.722 --> 00:22:57.726
I let it go because when I looked up, no one was there.

375
00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.561
But I have a bad feeling about this.

376
00:22:59.995 --> 00:23:01.997
Which company is holding the menu developing contest?

377
00:23:02.097 --> 00:23:04.400
It's SC Food and Beverage. Why?

378
00:23:07.002 --> 00:23:10.639
Did you see someone named Choi Sun Young on that day?

379
00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:11.840
Choi Sun Young?

380
00:23:12.875 --> 00:23:15.244
You mean Chief of Food Laboratory?

381
00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:17.312
She was a judge.

382
00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:28.056
What? Why are you wearing sunglasses all of a sudden?

383
00:23:33.362 --> 00:23:35.097
I got a second date.

384
00:23:35.397 --> 00:23:37.966
But your blind date likes someone with big eyes.

385
00:23:38.133 --> 00:23:40.302
What do you think? Aren't they big?

386
00:23:40.569 --> 00:23:42.004
What's your plan?

387
00:23:42.004 --> 00:23:43.906
You weren't supposed to have a second date.

388
00:23:43.906 --> 00:23:47.309
If I keep going on dates with him, I might have to marry him.

389
00:23:47.543 --> 00:23:50.612
Don't worry. I'll marry him in place of you.

390
00:23:50.746 --> 00:23:52.614
Hey! Come to your senses, okay?

391
00:23:53.582 --> 00:23:56.318
You have to be there on Friday for the third round.

392
00:23:56.318 --> 00:23:57.453
What are you talking about?

393
00:23:57.453 --> 00:23:59.154
I need to go on the second date.

394
00:23:59.455 --> 00:24:01.790
Whatever happens, you are his assistant.

395
00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:04.726
If you don't go, you'll ruin his life.

396
00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:07.296
Whatever.

397
00:24:07.563 --> 00:24:10.532
I'm not going to see him again. You need to handle this.

398
00:24:11.967 --> 00:24:13.902
What are you talking about?

399
00:24:14.136 --> 00:24:17.806
Myung Rang, you went on the date in Ru Ri's place?

400
00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.009
Mom, please keep this a secret.

401
00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:24.446
When I get a job, I'm going to tell Dad what I want.

402
00:24:24.613 --> 00:24:27.950
I will choose my job and the person whom I love.

403
00:24:28.016 --> 00:24:31.620
Then are you going to see him until then?

404
00:24:31.854 --> 00:24:33.055
See who?

405
00:24:37.526 --> 00:24:39.294
Why aren't you saying anything?

406
00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:40.996
Who are you going to see?

407
00:24:41.063 --> 00:24:43.065
I meant...

408
00:24:43.065 --> 00:24:44.366
The man she went on a date with.

409
00:24:44.533 --> 00:24:46.602
He's called Oh Mok Sim who works at the Korea Expressway Corporation.

410
00:24:46.602 --> 00:24:47.636
Right?

411
00:24:50.072 --> 00:24:51.640
Thank you, Mrs. Hong.

412
00:24:51.874 --> 00:24:53.008
Let's go, Ru Ri.

413
00:24:53.008 --> 00:24:54.076
All right.

414
00:24:56.545 --> 00:24:58.347
Excuse me.

415
00:24:58.814 --> 00:25:02.050
Who is that girl with the round eyes?

416
00:25:02.551 --> 00:25:04.286
She looks a lot like Myung Rang.

417
00:25:10.893 --> 00:25:13.595
Even though he hurt his arm, his menu was great.

418
00:25:14.062 --> 00:25:16.365
If he wins this contest, he will probably be employed.

419
00:25:16.365 --> 00:25:17.733
We need to stop him.

420
00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:18.967
But how?

421
00:25:19.034 --> 00:25:21.703
The decision is up to Chairman Kevin.

422
00:25:21.703 --> 00:25:23.572
Are you going to poison his food or something?

423
00:25:25.474 --> 00:25:26.808
What are you doing?

424
00:25:26.975 --> 00:25:29.545
Go and at least try to find Jung Hwa Young's ex-husband.

425
00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:30.779
I'm sorry.

426
00:25:35.217 --> 00:25:37.152
- How did you come here? - Get out.

427
00:25:51.199 --> 00:25:52.701
I knew it was you.

428
00:25:53.602 --> 00:25:55.637
You hurt Tae Yang, right?

429
00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:57.739
You kept ignoring me, and yet...

430
00:25:57.739 --> 00:25:59.741
you come straight away when her son is involved.

431
00:25:59.741 --> 00:26:01.376
Are you out of your mind?

432
00:26:01.476 --> 00:26:02.911
How dare you hurt him?

433
00:26:03.045 --> 00:26:05.981
He only hurt his arm this time, but what if it had been worse?

434
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:07.816
I admit that it was my fault.

435
00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:10.152
I should have hurt him badly if I was going to do anything.

436
00:26:10.152 --> 00:26:11.253
It was so mild.

437
00:26:11.253 --> 00:26:13.789
Are you out of your mind? You killed my brother and his wife.

438
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:15.057
Is that not enough for you?

439
00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:17.326
Are you saying that...

440
00:26:17.392 --> 00:26:19.795
you can kill someone to get what you want?

441
00:26:19.962 --> 00:26:23.231
Of course. If I was afraid, I wouldn't have even started.

442
00:26:23.765 --> 00:26:25.300
Why? Are you afraid?

443
00:26:25.901 --> 00:26:27.202
Then it's not too late.

444
00:26:27.202 --> 00:26:29.237
Leave that old woman and come to me.

445
00:26:29.371 --> 00:26:32.841
I can help you succeed.

446
00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:34.343
Please stop!

447
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.311
I beg you.

448
00:26:36.745 --> 00:26:39.548
Please, I beg you.

449
00:26:40.282 --> 00:26:42.017
Don't come near us ever again.

450
00:26:42.718 --> 00:26:44.486
Whatever you do,

451
00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.855
I will never be on your side.

452
00:26:47.122 --> 00:26:50.392
So please give up now.

453
00:26:52.728 --> 00:26:55.831
You are being fooled by that old woman.

454
00:27:04.139 --> 00:27:05.240
Did you know...

455
00:27:05.407 --> 00:27:08.610
that there are no records of her before she was 20 years old?

456
00:27:09.144 --> 00:27:11.346
She gave birth to Jung Tae Yang when she was 19 years old.

457
00:27:11.346 --> 00:27:12.748
We don't know who his father is...

458
00:27:12.748 --> 00:27:14.850
nor what she used to do when she was young.

459
00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:16.885
I'm warning you.

460
00:27:17.586 --> 00:27:21.323
If you hurt even one finger that belongs to my wife,

461
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.558
I won't forgive you.

462
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.901
Your wife?

463
00:27:36.104 --> 00:27:38.073
You can love her as much as you want.

464
00:27:38.306 --> 00:27:40.442
But I will destroy her.

465
00:27:44.846 --> 00:27:46.214
(Jin Ho)

466
00:27:53.655 --> 00:27:54.790
What is it now?

467
00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.725
When are you going to send the rest of the money?

468
00:27:56.792 --> 00:27:58.060
I told you.

469
00:27:58.226 --> 00:27:59.995
That's all I can give you.

470
00:28:00.062 --> 00:28:01.096
What?

471
00:28:01.463 --> 00:28:04.599
Stop joking around and give me the money.

472
00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:06.702
I don't have more money. Just leave me alone.

473
00:28:06.702 --> 00:28:08.403
If that's the case,

474
00:28:08.704 --> 00:28:11.206
I'll go and see how my son is doing as I'm already here.

475
00:28:11.907 --> 00:28:14.743
Why? I'm just a father who wants to see his son.

476
00:28:14.743 --> 00:28:17.045
Is that wrong? Is it?

477
00:28:17.412 --> 00:28:19.047
Hello? Hello?

478
00:28:22.517 --> 00:28:24.853
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

479
00:28:24.853 --> 00:28:25.987
He's out of his mind.

480
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:28.757
- Let's go. - Okay.

481
00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:32.894
Hey, stop there.

482
00:28:36.698 --> 00:28:37.799
You can go.

483
00:28:47.342 --> 00:28:49.010
I'm so sorry.

484
00:28:49.611 --> 00:28:50.645
I'm sorry.

485
00:28:51.379 --> 00:28:53.482
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

486
00:28:53.482 --> 00:28:55.751
Why isn't he getting his call?

487
00:28:58.053 --> 00:28:59.254
Woo Joo.

488
00:28:59.621 --> 00:29:02.057
You should have left first. Were you waiting for me?

489
00:29:02.057 --> 00:29:03.959
You can't live without me.

490
00:29:04.126 --> 00:29:07.095
The final book of "The Lily of Versailles" has been published.

491
00:29:07.095 --> 00:29:09.865
Really? Did Anthony and Sonya fall in love?

492
00:29:09.865 --> 00:29:12.000
- Let's buy it at the bookstore. - Okay, Eun Byul.

493
00:29:13.802 --> 00:29:16.705
Hi, it's been a long time.

494
00:29:20.375 --> 00:29:23.745
You are so handsome.

495
00:29:23.945 --> 00:29:26.248
You know why, right?

496
00:29:27.048 --> 00:29:30.652
It's all because you have my genes.

497
00:29:31.987 --> 00:29:34.589
Gosh, you're just like your mother.

498
00:29:34.656 --> 00:29:35.724
All right.

499
00:29:35.991 --> 00:29:37.025
Hey.

500
00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:39.761
Do you have money?

501
00:29:40.262 --> 00:29:44.633
I get really good scores recently.

502
00:29:44.633 --> 00:29:47.068
Did you save some of your pocket money?

503
00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:51.006
Move. I never had a father like you.

504
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.841
You scumbag!

505
00:29:53.308 --> 00:29:54.309
No.

506
00:29:54.943 --> 00:29:57.045
- Follow me. - Let me go!

507
00:29:57.612 --> 00:30:00.248
Talk to me. You can talk to me.

508
00:30:00.248 --> 00:30:02.851
- Let me go. You're embarrassing me. - You can talk to me.

509
00:30:02.851 --> 00:30:05.253
- Mom. - Don't follow me. Go home.

510
00:30:05.253 --> 00:30:07.055
Let me go. All right, I'll go with you.

511
00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:08.223
- Let me go. - Go home.

512
00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:11.526
Gosh, let me go.

513
00:30:16.264 --> 00:30:17.465
Yes, Eun Byul?

514
00:30:17.465 --> 00:30:19.601
Dad, there's a problem.

515
00:30:19.701 --> 00:30:22.204
Mom... Mom was...

516
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.640
What happened? Talk to me slowly.

517
00:30:29.311 --> 00:30:30.779
I told you...

518
00:30:30.812 --> 00:30:32.314
to leave Woo Joo out of this.

519
00:30:32.314 --> 00:30:33.548
I told you...

520
00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:35.851
I wanted money.

521
00:30:35.851 --> 00:30:38.153
I don't have a lot of money.

522
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.089
Do you know how hard it is for me whenever you take money from me?

523
00:30:42.324 --> 00:30:43.692
Let's please stop this.

524
00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:47.295
I don't expect you to be a father figure for Woo Joo.

525
00:30:47.796 --> 00:30:51.099
Just don't hurt his feelings.

526
00:30:51.366 --> 00:30:55.103
It's been hard enough for us.

527
00:30:55.537 --> 00:30:57.105
Let's please stop this.

528
00:30:57.205 --> 00:30:59.074
Please. Please!

529
00:30:59.074 --> 00:31:01.209
"Please. Please."

530
00:31:01.543 --> 00:31:05.513
Aren't you sick of saying the same thing every time we meet?

531
00:31:05.513 --> 00:31:07.048
Kim Jin Ho!

532
00:31:07.048 --> 00:31:08.783
Why? Jung Hwa Young!

533
00:31:10.051 --> 00:31:11.553
Let's get to the point.

534
00:31:12.254 --> 00:31:13.722
Are you going to give me the money?

535
00:31:13.722 --> 00:31:14.823
I don't have money.

536
00:31:15.056 --> 00:31:17.626
I had to lend money to send you the money.

537
00:31:17.626 --> 00:31:19.060
I really have no more to give you.

538
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:25.033
In that case,

539
00:31:27.602 --> 00:31:29.571
you need to pay it the other way.

540
00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:32.040
Right?

541
00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:34.776
What are you doing?

542
00:31:37.646 --> 00:31:38.713
Let me go!

543
00:31:39.247 --> 00:31:40.315
Hey.

544
00:31:41.783 --> 00:31:43.385
Someone I know...

545
00:31:44.052 --> 00:31:46.288
is looking for a prostitute to work for him in Itaewon.

546
00:31:47.055 --> 00:31:48.523
You look a little old,

547
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:52.027
but you have a nice body, and you can dance.

548
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:55.297
I guess you will pass easily, right?

549
00:31:57.065 --> 00:31:59.634
I will get the money from him in advance.

550
00:32:03.471 --> 00:32:04.706
You're crazy.

551
00:32:04.973 --> 00:32:07.976
You're not dead yet, Jung Hwa Young.

552
00:32:08.576 --> 00:32:09.611
Let's go.

553
00:32:11.079 --> 00:32:13.114
- Let me go. - Let's go.

554
00:32:21.222 --> 00:32:22.891
You scumbag.

555
00:32:24.225 --> 00:32:26.695
Who are you, scum?

556
00:32:27.062 --> 00:32:28.730
I can't believe this.

557
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.065
You scumbag.

558
00:32:30.699 --> 00:32:31.733
Let me go.

559
00:32:31.733 --> 00:32:35.203
No, you shouldn't. You shouldn't.

560
00:32:36.972 --> 00:32:39.708
Get lost if you don't want to die.

561
00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:42.711
All right. All right.

562
00:32:45.113 --> 00:32:46.114
You...

563
00:32:46.748 --> 00:32:48.817
You will regret this.

564
00:32:49.284 --> 00:32:51.052
I will make you regret it.

565
00:32:51.553 --> 00:32:53.021
Both of you.

566
00:33:12.307 --> 00:33:13.641
Yes, it's me.

567
00:33:13.808 --> 00:33:16.311
Remember the man who asked about me at your police station?

568
00:33:16.544 --> 00:33:17.612
Yes.

569
00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:19.881
He is from SC Food and Beverage?

570
00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:24.352
Tell him clearly...

571
00:33:24.386 --> 00:33:28.456
that I have something big on Jung Hwa Young.

572
00:33:28.957 --> 00:33:30.091
Okay.

573
00:33:40.402 --> 00:33:42.370
How dare they.

574
00:33:51.046 --> 00:33:54.315
It must feel awful.

575
00:33:55.784 --> 00:33:57.318
I felt like that too...

576
00:33:57.352 --> 00:33:59.654
when that strange grandmother came to our house.

577
00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:02.557
People never change.

578
00:34:03.725 --> 00:34:05.994
He made our lives an abyss when we lived together.

579
00:34:07.162 --> 00:34:10.031
He even came to visit us sometimes to harass Mom.

580
00:34:10.832 --> 00:34:13.468
Do you still remember what happened before?

581
00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:16.304
I will never forget it. And I shouldn't.

582
00:34:16.871 --> 00:34:18.506
He was so crazy about gambling...

583
00:34:18.506 --> 00:34:20.275
that he hit Mom and destroyed things saying he needed money.

584
00:34:21.543 --> 00:34:22.710
While trying to protect me,

585
00:34:23.812 --> 00:34:25.313
Tae Yang got beaten a lot for me.

586
00:34:26.981 --> 00:34:29.150
I hate being his son.

587
00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:32.821
I don't even want to grow up because I'm afraid I'll turn out like him.

588
00:34:40.195 --> 00:34:41.429
Don't worry.

589
00:34:42.097 --> 00:34:44.365
If he bugs you again,

590
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.401
I won't let him get you.

591
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:49.871
We may not be related by blood,

592
00:34:50.872 --> 00:34:52.340
but we're a real family.

593
00:35:02.817 --> 00:35:04.652
(Cafe Knife 247)

594
00:35:11.926 --> 00:35:15.196
You have to be there on Friday for the third round.

595
00:35:15.964 --> 00:35:17.098
I'll wait for you.

596
00:35:27.275 --> 00:35:30.812
If you don't go, you'll ruin his life.

597
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.820
Fine. I'll help him until the third round.

598
00:35:42.157 --> 00:35:43.324
Are you leaving now?

599
00:35:43.525 --> 00:35:44.659
Dad.

600
00:35:45.093 --> 00:35:46.294
I got the call.

601
00:35:47.028 --> 00:35:49.864
I heard you're seeing Mok Sin again today.

602
00:35:50.298 --> 00:35:52.734
- What? - Here. Have fun with your date.

603
00:35:53.868 --> 00:35:56.404
Don't make him pay for everything. Pay for the coffee.

604
00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:59.073
It's fine, Dad.

605
00:35:59.174 --> 00:36:02.277
Hey, don't worry.

606
00:36:02.443 --> 00:36:05.180
Just because I'm retired, it doesn't mean I can't give you some money.

607
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.315
- Dad. - Go ahead. Take it.

608
00:36:07.482 --> 00:36:08.616
Still.

609
00:36:08.816 --> 00:36:09.884
Let's go.

610
00:36:09.884 --> 00:36:11.553
Honey. Bring me the key.

611
00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:15.256
- To where? - What do you mean?

612
00:36:15.256 --> 00:36:17.825
- To meet Mok Sin. - Pardon?

613
00:36:18.026 --> 00:36:20.528
His family's excited.

614
00:36:20.962 --> 00:36:23.631
He's so picky...

615
00:36:23.865 --> 00:36:26.000
that he never found any woman good enough for him,

616
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.736
but you're the first one he asked for a second date.

617
00:36:29.003 --> 00:36:30.138
Good job.

618
00:36:30.572 --> 00:36:33.274
Good job. Well done, my dear daughter.

619
00:36:34.342 --> 00:36:35.543
So...

620
00:36:37.679 --> 00:36:39.614
are you going to give her a ride?

621
00:36:39.814 --> 00:36:43.551
Yes. I'm meeting up with a friend for lunch anyway.

622
00:36:43.551 --> 00:36:45.520
I'll drop her off on the way.

623
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.591
What if her makeup gets erased on the transit...

624
00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:51.826
because it's so hot?

625
00:36:51.826 --> 00:36:53.094
It'll make her look stupid.

626
00:36:54.262 --> 00:36:57.131
It's fine, Dad. You don't need to.

627
00:36:57.365 --> 00:36:58.700
Don't worry about it.

628
00:36:59.133 --> 00:37:02.870
I'm also going to check what he looks like.

629
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:07.542
Honey. I'll go.

630
00:37:07.542 --> 00:37:10.845
You'll probably drink when you meet your friend.

631
00:37:10.845 --> 00:37:12.547
It's a hassle to call a chauffeur service.

632
00:37:12.547 --> 00:37:14.215
I'll drive her.

633
00:37:14.382 --> 00:37:16.985
Right, Dad. You should never get yourself tired.

634
00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:18.419
I'll go with Mom.

635
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.154
- Let's go, Mom. - Okay.

636
00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:22.023
Okay. Sure.

637
00:37:24.025 --> 00:37:26.794
Now that she's grown up,

638
00:37:27.028 --> 00:37:28.596
she worries about me.

639
00:37:30.231 --> 00:37:31.366
Great.

640
00:37:34.402 --> 00:37:35.570
My goodness.

641
00:37:35.737 --> 00:37:38.306
You're killing me, Ru Ri.

642
00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:40.341
Do you have to bail on your date...

643
00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:42.277
and go see him again?

644
00:37:42.277 --> 00:37:45.980
I told you, Mom. I have to be there in place of Myung Rang.

645
00:37:46.114 --> 00:37:49.117
If he can't find any assistant, he'll be alone in the contest.

646
00:37:49.117 --> 00:37:50.885
Then he'll never win.

647
00:37:50.985 --> 00:37:53.021
Why do you care?

648
00:37:53.054 --> 00:37:54.922
Why would you worry about him?

649
00:37:54.922 --> 00:37:56.190
Of course I am worried.

650
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:59.027
He must win so that he'll get the job.

651
00:37:59.027 --> 00:38:02.463
Oh, my goodness. He doesn't even have a job?

652
00:38:02.463 --> 00:38:05.300
He's been working as a club mate manager.

653
00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.734
Lee Ru Ri.

654
00:38:06.801 --> 00:38:08.469
Manager is only a title.

655
00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:09.971
He just wants to have fun...

656
00:38:09.971 --> 00:38:11.673
going around the world with a part-time job.

657
00:38:11.673 --> 00:38:14.942
Whatever you say, I'll help him until the third round.

658
00:38:14.942 --> 00:38:16.544
Just so you know.

659
00:38:16.811 --> 00:38:18.379
Oh, my goodness.

660
00:38:34.862 --> 00:38:36.431
Hey, you're here.

661
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:38.499
My mom gave me a ride.

662
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:44.639
Hello, ma'am.

663
00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:48.910
Come in for a cup of tea.

664
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.112
No, it's fine. I know you're busy.

665
00:38:51.346 --> 00:38:52.547
Please come in.

666
00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.383
I wouldn't be able to focus if you just leave.

667
00:39:02.657 --> 00:39:05.593
It's on me today, so enjoy it.

668
00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:07.462
Do you have good news or something?

669
00:39:07.528 --> 00:39:09.297
You look great.

670
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.633
Don't get me started. Who knows? We might become in-laws.

671
00:39:12.734 --> 00:39:15.403
Then is Mok Sin and your daughter...

672
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.805
- What's her name again? - Ru Ri.

673
00:39:17.805 --> 00:39:19.140
Right, Ru Ri.

674
00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:20.274
Are they getting married?

675
00:39:20.274 --> 00:39:21.275
You can look forward to it.

676
00:39:21.275 --> 00:39:23.444
I'll give you an invitation to their wedding this year.

677
00:39:24.345 --> 00:39:27.048
I can't believe it.

678
00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:28.983
You were so worried...

679
00:39:28.983 --> 00:39:30.885
that she had trouble finding a job.

680
00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:35.156
Hey, there are only two ways for women.

681
00:39:35.256 --> 00:39:37.992
Either they're pretty or they're smart.

682
00:39:38.025 --> 00:39:41.696
Ru Ri takes after her mom, so she's pretty.

683
00:39:42.063 --> 00:39:43.197
Right.

684
00:39:43.431 --> 00:39:45.600
Ru Ri was pretty when she was young,

685
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.902
but what happened to her?

686
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:49.003
What are you talking about?

687
00:39:49.003 --> 00:39:52.073
My son's pretty quiet, so he never says anything,

688
00:39:52.073 --> 00:39:53.241
but he said...

689
00:39:53.508 --> 00:39:55.410
her eyes are very small.

690
00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:56.444
What?

691
00:39:56.844 --> 00:40:00.047
Hey, are you sure your son's eyes are all right?

692
00:40:00.615 --> 00:40:02.750
Hold on. Here.

693
00:40:04.118 --> 00:40:05.920
Do you still think they're small?

694
00:40:06.421 --> 00:40:09.190
She has such big eyes.

695
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.826
Her eyes are so big. What was he talking about?

696
00:40:11.826 --> 00:40:16.697
Hey, ask your son when he comes home tonight.

697
00:40:17.131 --> 00:40:20.101
He's with Ru Ri right now.

698
00:40:27.909 --> 00:40:29.444
What have you done to your eyes?

699
00:40:29.544 --> 00:40:30.678
Do you like it?

700
00:40:31.112 --> 00:40:32.713
It's for you.

701
00:40:33.047 --> 00:40:34.215
For you.

702
00:40:34.816 --> 00:40:36.250
Why did you take off your glasses?

703
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.319
- To protect my eyes. - Good job.

704
00:40:38.419 --> 00:40:41.823
I might hurt your eyes because I'm so beautiful.

705
00:40:44.025 --> 00:40:45.159
I can't close my eyes.

706
00:40:45.326 --> 00:40:46.461
Whatever.

707
00:40:47.261 --> 00:40:49.730
- Give me my bag. - Right. The bag.

708
00:40:50.631 --> 00:40:51.899
I'm sorry.

709
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.734
It's at home.

710
00:40:53.734 --> 00:40:55.503
What?

711
00:40:55.636 --> 00:40:58.306
- Look at you. - Calm down.

712
00:40:58.573 --> 00:40:59.941
You're impatient.

713
00:41:00.241 --> 00:41:01.342
Let's go.

714
00:41:01.509 --> 00:41:03.811
My house is nearby. I'll give it to you right away.

715
00:41:04.445 --> 00:41:05.580
My eyes are burning.

716
00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:07.448
Excuse me, Ms. Lee Ru Ri.

717
00:41:07.782 --> 00:41:08.983
Hey, Lee Ru Ri!

718
00:41:11.986 --> 00:41:14.489
Only if she wasn't my father's friend's daughter.

719
00:41:22.196 --> 00:41:25.132
Mom. Mom. Have a seat here.

720
00:41:27.468 --> 00:41:29.003
How do you find this place?

721
00:41:29.504 --> 00:41:33.074
It's a cooking workshop. He rented it for a day for practice.

722
00:41:37.111 --> 00:41:39.447
Try it. It's Hanrabong juice.

723
00:41:39.547 --> 00:41:40.615
Okay.

724
00:41:41.883 --> 00:41:43.050
Thank you.

725
00:41:44.886 --> 00:41:47.755
Are you good at cooking?

726
00:41:47.755 --> 00:41:50.658
It's more like a means of survival rather than a talent.

727
00:41:51.158 --> 00:41:53.094
My mom was busy working,

728
00:41:53.294 --> 00:41:56.330
so I had to take care of my brother since I was young.

729
00:41:56.364 --> 00:41:59.700
Goodness. What about your father?

730
00:41:59.734 --> 00:42:00.902
I don't have one.

731
00:42:01.402 --> 00:42:03.404
My mom's a single mother.

732
00:42:04.405 --> 00:42:07.675
Now she's met a good man and is living with him.

733
00:42:08.075 --> 00:42:11.012
Did she give birth to two children...

734
00:42:11.846 --> 00:42:14.382
as a single mother?

735
00:42:15.716 --> 00:42:19.620
No, my brother is from the second father.

736
00:42:21.322 --> 00:42:23.291
Then now...

737
00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:26.928
it's the third?

738
00:42:27.662 --> 00:42:28.696
Yes.

739
00:42:29.363 --> 00:42:31.799
She finally met a good man after three times.

740
00:42:32.366 --> 00:42:35.903
Although he's younger than her,

741
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.905
he's a real man.

742
00:42:38.072 --> 00:42:40.508
Also, she adopted a daughter.

743
00:42:44.579 --> 00:42:45.780
Are you surprised?

744
00:42:48.115 --> 00:42:50.384
But I'm proud of my mom.

745
00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:53.521
She tried her best...

746
00:42:53.988 --> 00:42:55.489
even in the difficult situation.

747
00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.025
Yes. I see.

748
00:42:59.026 --> 00:43:00.962
I should leave now.

749
00:43:02.697 --> 00:43:05.132
Don't be too late.

750
00:43:05.132 --> 00:43:07.468
Mom. Mom.

751
00:43:08.135 --> 00:43:09.303
My goodness.

752
00:43:09.303 --> 00:43:11.072
Mom.

753
00:43:15.943 --> 00:43:18.679
This is insane. She could've picked a better man.

754
00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:20.881
Mom. Mom.

755
00:43:20.881 --> 00:43:24.051
You can't just leave. He'll feel embarrassed.

756
00:43:24.118 --> 00:43:27.021
Forget about the third round. Don't ever see him again.

757
00:43:27.154 --> 00:43:29.523
He's no good to you if you keep seeing him.

758
00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:32.460
I'm disappointed in you. I thought you're different from Dad.

759
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.662
How could you evaluate him based on his condition?

760
00:43:34.662 --> 00:43:36.364
He's beyond the limit.

761
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:37.698
Ask anyone on the street.

762
00:43:37.832 --> 00:43:40.234
No parent would like their daughter dating someone like him.

763
00:43:40.234 --> 00:43:41.736
You're overreacting, Mom.

764
00:43:41.736 --> 00:43:44.372
I didn't say I'll marry him. We're only working together.

765
00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:45.773
That's only an excuse.

766
00:43:45.773 --> 00:43:47.742
That's how relationships start.

767
00:43:48.275 --> 00:43:49.810
You said it yourself.

768
00:43:49.944 --> 00:43:53.481
You said you'll get a job and live your life.

769
00:43:53.614 --> 00:43:56.117
What you need right now is a job.

770
00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:59.520
If you fall in love when you can't even take care of yourself,

771
00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.988
you'll end up like me.

772
00:44:01.922 --> 00:44:04.659
Whatever you say, I must join the third round,

773
00:44:04.659 --> 00:44:06.594
- so please... - Be quiet.

774
00:44:07.695 --> 00:44:11.098
If you ever see him again, I'm going to tell Dad.

775
00:44:11.966 --> 00:44:14.568
Your dad may be strict and assertive,

776
00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:16.737
but that doesn't mean you can stab him in the back.

777
00:44:17.138 --> 00:44:19.273
Wrap everything up today.

778
00:44:29.116 --> 00:44:30.484
It's here.

779
00:44:31.485 --> 00:44:33.421
I thought you live in Mok-dong.

780
00:44:33.521 --> 00:44:34.622
Do you live in the studio apartment here?

781
00:44:34.622 --> 00:44:35.656
What?

782
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:38.926
Well, this is my workroom.

783
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.862
- A study room for me. - That's enough.

784
00:44:42.797 --> 00:44:44.732
Go inside, and get my bag.

785
00:44:47.134 --> 00:44:49.670
- What are you doing? - Mok Sin,

786
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:51.172
do you...

787
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.341
want to eat ramen with me?

788
00:44:54.341 --> 00:44:57.912
You just had a meal and two pieces of cake. You want to eat more?

789
00:44:57.912 --> 00:45:00.281
Look at your waistline.

790
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.719
It's dessert.

791
00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:08.422
I live in Room 510.

792
00:45:10.925 --> 00:45:13.094
My legs feel weak. It hurts.

793
00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:16.630
Who is she?

794
00:45:17.698 --> 00:45:20.067
She's not completely insane.

795
00:45:20.234 --> 00:45:21.502
Room 510.

796
00:45:21.969 --> 00:45:23.671
Gosh, I'm so scared.

797
00:45:46.193 --> 00:45:47.661
How's your mom?

798
00:45:48.162 --> 00:45:50.231
She seemed to be upset after she saw me.

799
00:45:50.331 --> 00:45:53.901
You didn't have to tell her everything.

800
00:45:54.135 --> 00:45:56.237
She'd find out eventually.

801
00:45:57.271 --> 00:45:58.773
I didn't want to hide it.

802
00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:06.313
Why?

803
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:08.716
Are you disappointed too?

804
00:46:12.419 --> 00:46:13.487
But...

805
00:46:15.422 --> 00:46:16.757
I'm sorry.

806
00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:20.594
I can't help you on the third round.

807
00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:25.900
I mean, I don't think I can meet you anymore.

808
00:46:26.567 --> 00:46:27.635
Why is that?

809
00:46:29.804 --> 00:46:32.773
Is your mom against us along with your dad?

810
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.575
That's also a problem,

811
00:46:35.943 --> 00:46:38.012
but I thought about it,

812
00:46:38.345 --> 00:46:40.281
and I think Mom was right.

813
00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:42.850
I want to look after myself first.

814
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.718
I'm not even employed.

815
00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.655
I don't deserve...

816
00:46:48.489 --> 00:46:50.291
to like someone yet.

817
00:46:51.826 --> 00:46:52.960
In that case,

818
00:46:53.928 --> 00:46:55.596
there's one way.

819
00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.065
Let's win the third round.

820
00:46:58.999 --> 00:47:01.635
The winner of the contest gets special employment.

821
00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:04.972
You're an assistant, but we're a team.

822
00:47:05.005 --> 00:47:06.574
You can get employed too.

823
00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:10.277
Me? That doesn't make sense.

824
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:11.946
I'm really bad at cooking.

825
00:47:11.946 --> 00:47:13.614
You've seen how I'm like.

826
00:47:13.614 --> 00:47:17.251
I already told you that you have a special talent.

827
00:47:17.318 --> 00:47:18.352
Manager Jung.

828
00:47:18.352 --> 00:47:19.553
Trust me.

829
00:47:21.522 --> 00:47:23.791
If you are not sure about our relationship after the contest,

830
00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:26.927
I'll respect your decision then.

831
00:47:36.237 --> 00:47:38.272
I'm so upset. This is so upsetting.

832
00:47:39.173 --> 00:47:41.575
I don't know if she's weird or bold.

833
00:47:42.443 --> 00:47:44.345
What if she fails?

834
00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:45.980
What will she do with her dad?

835
00:47:46.614 --> 00:47:48.482
Why are you talking to yourself?

836
00:47:48.849 --> 00:47:49.884
Oh, my.

837
00:47:50.985 --> 00:47:52.887
Why are you home so early?

838
00:47:52.887 --> 00:47:56.790
Well, I must be getting old now.

839
00:47:57.191 --> 00:47:59.326
I only had a drink during lunch, and I feel dizzy.

840
00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.061
Do you want me to make a detox juice?

841
00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:02.196
It's all right.

842
00:48:02.196 --> 00:48:04.798
You always say it takes a lot of work.

843
00:48:05.866 --> 00:48:07.067
It won't take long.

844
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:08.302
Honey.

845
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.674
Thank you.

846
00:48:14.241 --> 00:48:15.276
About what?

847
00:48:15.609 --> 00:48:17.444
For cancelling marriage graduation.

848
00:48:17.945 --> 00:48:20.180
When I think about what would happen after Ru Ri gets married,

849
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:22.049
it's such a relief.

850
00:48:25.986 --> 00:48:28.155
And...

851
00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:30.791
what do you think about...

852
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:33.460
selling this house and moving to Ilsan or Namyangju?

853
00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.696
A house of 100m².

854
00:48:35.696 --> 00:48:38.866
Why? Do you need money?

855
00:48:38.866 --> 00:48:40.968
We need some money if Ru Ri is going to...

856
00:48:41.135 --> 00:48:42.770
get married this fall.

857
00:48:43.404 --> 00:48:47.341
Everyone wants a wife that works.

858
00:48:47.408 --> 00:48:49.209
We need to at least help them buy a house...

859
00:48:49.276 --> 00:48:51.845
so that she wouldn't be looked down upon when she gets married.

860
00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.216
The children is all we have in our lives.

861
00:48:57.318 --> 00:49:00.921
If it's for my children, I don't think it's a waste of money.

862
00:49:02.656 --> 00:49:05.793
Tomorrow, I'll start searching for houses.

863
00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:06.961
All right?

864
00:49:12.399 --> 00:49:15.002
Don't expect too much from your children.

865
00:49:15.569 --> 00:49:17.504
Don't be too kind to them.

866
00:49:20.741 --> 00:49:22.710
He'd be more disappointed.

867
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.656
How is it? Do you like it?

868
00:49:36.323 --> 00:49:37.791
I'm sorry.

869
00:49:39.259 --> 00:49:42.629
It's delicious, but it's not unique.

870
00:49:43.464 --> 00:49:44.865
I know.

871
00:49:45.632 --> 00:49:46.633
The assignment for the final...

872
00:49:46.633 --> 00:49:49.670
is to make a meal to satisfy Chairman Kevin.

873
00:49:50.504 --> 00:49:51.805
But I don't have any ideas.

874
00:49:51.805 --> 00:49:54.942
I've thought about this, and I think...

875
00:49:55.075 --> 00:49:58.879
we'll only be able to win if we know our enemy.

876
00:49:59.179 --> 00:50:00.814
I already know about him.

877
00:50:03.217 --> 00:50:06.320
But he's been living in the US, so there's not much information.

878
00:50:08.222 --> 00:50:09.523
Is this it?

879
00:50:09.523 --> 00:50:10.691
(Kevin Miller)

880
00:50:10.824 --> 00:50:12.860
He is a mysterious person.

881
00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:17.464
Why does he seem so familiar?

882
00:50:18.332 --> 00:50:19.566
Where did I see him?

883
00:50:20.467 --> 00:50:21.568
Where?

884
00:50:21.635 --> 00:50:23.270
I saw him somewhere.

885
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.371
Think hard.

886
00:50:24.405 --> 00:50:25.472
Where was it?

887
00:50:25.472 --> 00:50:27.174
- Hurry up. - Wait.

888
00:50:27.508 --> 00:50:28.942
Wait. Joo Ae Ri.

889
00:50:28.942 --> 00:50:31.211
- Who's that? - You know that mean girl.

890
00:50:31.211 --> 00:50:33.447
When Bong Myung Tae cheated on me,

891
00:50:33.447 --> 00:50:35.616
I went through all her SNS posts.

892
00:50:35.716 --> 00:50:37.851
His picture was there for sure.

893
00:50:41.822 --> 00:50:43.490
(At a restaurant in Los Angeles with my lovely Kevin.)

894
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.426
"At a restaurant in Los Angeles with my lovely Kevin."

895
00:50:45.426 --> 00:50:47.594
See? I was right.

896
00:50:47.594 --> 00:50:48.595
You were.

897
00:50:49.563 --> 00:50:51.098
But how do they know each other?

898
00:50:51.365 --> 00:50:52.900
Wait a moment.

899
00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:57.871
Gosh, I don't want to call him.

900
00:50:59.773 --> 00:51:00.841
What?

901
00:51:01.341 --> 00:51:04.411
It's just because I want to ask you something.

902
00:51:04.411 --> 00:51:06.046
About Joo Ae Ri...

903
00:51:06.046 --> 00:51:07.481
Are you teasing me?

904
00:51:07.481 --> 00:51:09.383
I don't want to even hear her name.

905
00:51:09.383 --> 00:51:11.485
We broke up because of you.

906
00:51:11.485 --> 00:51:13.887
- Gosh. - Bong Myung Tae. Wait, wait.

907
00:51:13.887 --> 00:51:15.522
Please, please don't hang up.

908
00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:17.191
What?

909
00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:19.927
Do you know a person called Kevin?

910
00:51:19.927 --> 00:51:21.095
Kevin Miller.

911
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:23.130
The Chairman of SC Food and Beverage?

912
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.431
Yes, that's right.

913
00:51:24.431 --> 00:51:26.500
Do you know anything about him?

914
00:51:27.634 --> 00:51:29.736
He's her dad.

915
00:51:30.737 --> 00:51:31.772
Really?

916
00:51:32.272 --> 00:51:35.342
What else do you know about him?

917
00:51:35.442 --> 00:51:38.445
Do you know about his personalities, tastes, or childhood?

918
00:51:38.445 --> 00:51:41.081
I don't know. I've never even seen him before.

919
00:51:41.115 --> 00:51:44.551
I just know that he lived at an orphanage in Jeolla Province,

920
00:51:44.651 --> 00:51:45.919
got adopted in the US when he was six,

921
00:51:45.919 --> 00:51:47.888
got famous for his restaurant business,

922
00:51:47.888 --> 00:51:50.591
and founded SC Food and Beverage.

923
00:51:50.691 --> 00:51:52.960
She boasted so much about him.

924
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.329
- Why do you ask? - Thank you, Myung Tae.

925
00:51:55.329 --> 00:51:57.030
I knew you'd be of use someday.

926
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.099
I forgive all your sins now.

927
00:51:59.099 --> 00:52:00.501
All right? Have a great life.

928
00:52:00.501 --> 00:52:01.702
(End call)

929
00:52:01.735 --> 00:52:04.071
Hey, hey! You wench!

930
00:52:05.672 --> 00:52:09.042
Gosh, she's always so mean.

931
00:52:12.379 --> 00:52:15.649
She must have wanted to hear my voice again.

932
00:52:22.823 --> 00:52:23.991
You heard him, right?

933
00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:26.693
He lived in the US after he was adopted when he was six.

934
00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:30.130
Now I know what I should do.

935
00:52:30.697 --> 00:52:31.798
Ru Ri.

936
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.234
Well done.

937
00:52:35.769 --> 00:52:37.971
If I win the contest, it's all thanks to you.

938
00:52:38.238 --> 00:52:39.239
Well done.

939
00:52:39.773 --> 00:52:41.842
You're very talented.

940
00:52:41.942 --> 00:52:43.443
You shouldn't compliment me now.

941
00:52:43.443 --> 00:52:45.546
I'll hear all your compliments after we win the contest.

942
00:52:47.581 --> 00:52:50.050
You sound like a real assistant.

943
00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:51.218
Of course.

944
00:52:51.251 --> 00:52:54.555
If I can only get employed, I can do anything.

945
00:52:54.821 --> 00:52:58.926
But you need to keep your promise.

946
00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:00.928
What promise?

947
00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:04.631
You said you'll respect my decision after we win the contest.

948
00:53:07.801 --> 00:53:08.869
All right.

949
00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:11.572
Let's win the contest first.

950
00:53:11.572 --> 00:53:12.573
Okay.

951
00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.776
Kevin, we'll destroy you.

952
00:53:19.546 --> 00:53:21.448
(Kevin Miller)

953
00:53:27.754 --> 00:53:29.823
What is it? Is something wrong?

954
00:53:29.823 --> 00:53:31.491
It could be too early,

955
00:53:31.491 --> 00:53:33.927
or it could be an ectopic pregnancy.

956
00:53:33.927 --> 00:53:35.429
You should take a blood test.

957
00:53:36.363 --> 00:53:37.631
Oh, my goodness.

958
00:53:38.699 --> 00:53:40.100
What should I do?

959
00:53:49.943 --> 00:53:51.044
Baby.

960
00:53:51.845 --> 00:53:54.348
Baby. Yeon Ju, come on.

961
00:53:55.215 --> 00:53:57.884
Why are you calling me? I'm so upset.

962
00:53:58.385 --> 00:54:01.488
Here, you should drink this. It's a little hot.

963
00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:04.091
- What is this? - Who do you think I am?

964
00:54:04.424 --> 00:54:06.560
I am a problem solver.

965
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.329
Trust me and drink it up.

966
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:10.731
Drink it.

967
00:54:12.399 --> 00:54:16.003
Gosh, it tastes so strange.

968
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:19.072
The color is disgusting too. What is it?

969
00:54:19.072 --> 00:54:22.843
You can still taste things all right.

970
00:54:22.909 --> 00:54:26.880
Think of it as a cure drink. This water was boiled with panties.

971
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.816
Mom! Are you out of your mind?

972
00:54:30.717 --> 00:54:33.420
You're so rude.

973
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.822
Why do you think I do this?

974
00:54:35.922 --> 00:54:38.659
It feels like a needle is...

975
00:54:38.659 --> 00:54:40.794
poking my heart.

976
00:54:40.794 --> 00:54:43.363
How can you make your only daughter...

977
00:54:43.363 --> 00:54:45.365
drink water boiled with panties?

978
00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:48.001
This isn't just normal panties.

979
00:54:48.001 --> 00:54:49.903
You know the vet down the street?

980
00:54:49.903 --> 00:54:53.674
The wife of that man gave birth to six children in consecutive years.

981
00:54:53.674 --> 00:54:57.311
So I stole one of her panties in the backyard,

982
00:54:57.311 --> 00:55:00.047
and boiled it.

983
00:55:00.347 --> 00:55:02.115
You even steal now?

984
00:55:02.115 --> 00:55:04.151
And you stole someone's panties?

985
00:55:05.218 --> 00:55:08.722
Hey, what wouldn't a mother do for her child?

986
00:55:08.722 --> 00:55:11.191
She becomes pregnant...

987
00:55:11.191 --> 00:55:14.194
just by looking at her husband.

988
00:55:14.194 --> 00:55:17.798
So if I drink water with her panties boiled, I'll get pregnant?

989
00:55:17.798 --> 00:55:21.301
I'm trying my best. Listen to me!

990
00:55:21.802 --> 00:55:24.771
Also, put this deep inside...

991
00:55:24.905 --> 00:55:26.673
your husband's pillow.

992
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:30.344
And put this around your waist.

993
00:55:30.344 --> 00:55:33.947
Do you think it's still the time when you dug shells in Beolgyo?

994
00:55:36.717 --> 00:55:38.618
I'm going to the clinic for the result. Follow me.

995
00:55:41.321 --> 00:55:44.324
Right now, I'm combining all superstitions...

996
00:55:44.324 --> 00:55:46.026
with modern science.

997
00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.469
Eat slowly.

998
00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:57.003
I'll give you more if you need more.

999
00:56:01.141 --> 00:56:02.542
You can tell me.

1000
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:05.445
Who's your mom?

1001
00:56:06.713 --> 00:56:08.081
Where's your house?

1002
00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:13.053
You must stay quiet no matter what.

1003
00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:15.522
You don't know your name, who I am,

1004
00:56:15.522 --> 00:56:17.758
Mom's name, the address, and everything else.

1005
00:56:17.758 --> 00:56:18.925
Don't say a thing.

1006
00:56:19.793 --> 00:56:22.863
If you do, you'll never get to see me again.

1007
00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:24.464
Get it?

1008
00:56:25.298 --> 00:56:26.500
You can tell me.

1009
00:56:27.134 --> 00:56:28.568
What's your mom's name?

1010
00:56:30.404 --> 00:56:31.505
Okay.

1011
00:56:31.505 --> 00:56:33.140
Calm down.

1012
00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:43.250
I got it now.

1013
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.621
Stop there.

1014
00:56:48.522 --> 00:56:49.689
It's the kid.

1015
00:56:49.823 --> 00:56:51.324
Can you zoom in the guardian's face?

1016
00:56:51.324 --> 00:56:52.392
Yes.

1017
00:56:58.198 --> 00:56:59.900
Do you know her by any chance?

1018
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.102
No. I've never seen her before.

1019
00:57:02.202 --> 00:57:04.671
Why would she abandon her kid in our clinic?

1020
00:57:04.905 --> 00:57:06.339
That's what I want to know.

1021
00:57:07.941 --> 00:57:10.444
We can't delay it anymore. Let's call the police.

1022
00:57:10.777 --> 00:57:11.945
Yes, sir.

1023
00:57:15.382 --> 00:57:16.483
Doctor.

1024
00:57:17.217 --> 00:57:19.152
I found someone who knows the kid.

1025
00:57:19.519 --> 00:57:20.620
Here.

1026
00:57:20.821 --> 00:57:24.191
I posted her picture on the website many mothers use,

1027
00:57:24.191 --> 00:57:27.461
and her kindergarten teacher contacted me.

1028
00:57:27.961 --> 00:57:30.030
Then we can find out who her parents are.

1029
00:57:31.298 --> 00:57:35.635
Unfortunately, the blood test says you're not pregnant.

1030
00:57:35.735 --> 00:57:36.803
- What? - What?

1031
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:38.805
No way.

1032
00:57:38.805 --> 00:57:42.342
How can I get two lines when I'm not pregnant?

1033
00:57:42.342 --> 00:57:44.578
I checked it three times.

1034
00:57:44.578 --> 00:57:46.313
She's right.

1035
00:57:46.313 --> 00:57:50.884
I checked it 3 times with my 2 eyes.

1036
00:57:50.884 --> 00:57:54.254
Pregnancy testers aren't always correct,

1037
00:57:54.821 --> 00:57:58.525
or it could be polycystic ovary syndrome.

1038
00:57:58.692 --> 00:58:00.293
- Polycystic ovary? - Polycystic ovary?

1039
00:58:00.293 --> 00:58:01.595
- What's that? - What's that?

1040
00:58:01.595 --> 00:58:04.197
You said you have period irregularly.

1041
00:58:04.197 --> 00:58:07.801
Yes. Sometimes it comes after two months.

1042
00:58:08.368 --> 00:58:10.003
It's irregular.

1043
00:58:10.003 --> 00:58:13.673
Doctor. Is there something wrong?

1044
00:58:13.773 --> 00:58:15.742
That could cause sterility.

1045
00:58:15.909 --> 00:58:17.077
Sterility?

1046
00:58:17.444 --> 00:58:18.712
Mom.

1047
00:58:18.712 --> 00:58:22.082
Doctor, are you saying my daughter...

1048
00:58:22.082 --> 00:58:24.484
can't get pregnant?

1049
00:58:24.484 --> 00:58:26.620
You've been married for four years,

1050
00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.422
but you haven't gotten pregnant yet, right?

1051
00:58:29.422 --> 00:58:30.423
Right.

1052
00:58:30.423 --> 00:58:32.192
Then you should've come earlier.

1053
00:58:32.692 --> 00:58:35.428
You can't get pregnant right now.

1054
00:58:35.462 --> 00:58:37.931
What did you just say?

1055
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:39.232
How dare you say that?

1056
00:58:41.902 --> 00:58:43.136
Is it her?

1057
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:45.272
Yes, I'm sure.

1058
00:58:45.405 --> 00:58:47.774
Her name is Han Gyul. Oh Han Gyul.

1059
00:58:48.408 --> 00:58:49.943
She stopped coming here...

1060
00:58:49.943 --> 00:58:52.512
after March of this year.

1061
00:58:53.179 --> 00:58:55.382
Is there any way I can find her guardian?

1062
00:58:55.382 --> 00:58:56.383
(Student Record)

1063
00:59:01.321 --> 00:59:02.489
Here it is.

1064
00:59:02.923 --> 00:59:05.425
It says her guardian is her mother.

1065
00:59:06.526 --> 00:59:09.195
Her name is Jung Su Mi.

1066
00:59:09.462 --> 00:59:10.797
Did you say Jung Su Mi?

1067
00:59:15.135 --> 00:59:16.469
Are you sure?

1068
00:59:34.888 --> 00:59:37.290
Her mom's name is Jung Su Mi.

1069
00:59:54.674 --> 00:59:56.209
How did you live your life...

1070
00:59:56.843 --> 01:00:00.213
that you could even abandon your child, Jung Su Mi?

1071
01:00:12.258 --> 01:00:14.961
Here. It's your final contest today, isn't it?

1072
01:00:15.261 --> 01:00:17.230
- Eat a lot, and cheer up. - Don't worry.

1073
01:00:18.064 --> 01:00:19.733
I've gotten better now.

1074
01:00:19.733 --> 01:00:22.502
Look at you. Go beat them all.

1075
01:00:22.502 --> 01:00:23.670
What was that?

1076
01:00:28.908 --> 01:00:31.911
Dad. Did you scold them?

1077
01:00:32.979 --> 01:00:34.981
Why are they so down?

1078
01:00:34.981 --> 01:00:36.449
That's not it.

1079
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:38.885
Woo Joo's real father was here.

1080
01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:43.423
And? Did he bug Mom again?

1081
01:00:45.191 --> 01:00:46.426
Pretend like you don't know.

1082
01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.194
She must be going through a lot right now.

1083
01:00:53.633 --> 01:00:55.468
You'll regret this.

1084
01:00:55.602 --> 01:00:57.303
I will make you regret it.

1085
01:01:29.636 --> 01:01:31.071
What are you looking at?

1086
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.941
- What's that? - Honey, that's nothing.

1087
01:01:35.575 --> 01:01:38.344
Nothing. It's nothing.

1088
01:01:41.214 --> 01:01:42.615
I need to know now.

1089
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:45.118
What is it that's making you suffer?

1090
01:02:04.771 --> 01:02:07.040
Who's this?

1091
01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:10.910
Is it him?

1092
01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:15.882
Am I right?

1093
01:02:20.253 --> 01:02:21.521
He's...

1094
01:02:25.024 --> 01:02:26.292
Tae Yang's father.

1095
01:02:29.195 --> 01:02:31.131
(2017 SC Food and Beverage Menu Developing Final Contest)

1096
01:02:31.965 --> 01:02:34.501
- Did you have a good dream? - Yes.

1097
01:02:34.734 --> 01:02:36.903
Two dragons suddenly appeared in front of me,

1098
01:02:36.903 --> 01:02:38.972
and they ascended to the sky.

1099
01:02:39.072 --> 01:02:41.775
- That's a precognitive dream. - What? A precognitive dream?

1100
01:02:42.809 --> 01:02:44.010
Why would you touch your belly?

1101
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.812
You're so naive. Let's go.

1102
01:02:46.045 --> 01:02:48.214
Move. Make a way.

1103
01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:14.073
Welcome.

1104
01:03:14.507 --> 01:03:15.742
Long time no see.
