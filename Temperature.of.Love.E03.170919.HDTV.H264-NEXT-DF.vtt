00:00:07.832 --> 00:00:09.495
Let go of my hand.

3
00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:13.770
Did it bother you,
when you're not even interested in me?

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.716
Are you upset about me rejecting you?

5
00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.403
I'd be crazy not to be!

6
00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:19.138
So you really were serious, huh?

7
00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:20.830
And you really didn't  think
much of it, did you?

8
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.315
You really have to have
the last word, don't you?

9
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:25.405
You really won't ever let me
have the last word, will you?

10
00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:31.173
I'll make this clear.

11
00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.117
I'm not the type to keep trying my
luck with a woman who rejected me.

12
00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:38.467
I like that.

13
00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:39.523
Follow me.

14
00:00:55.543 --> 00:00:56.690
Why are we here?

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.395
Give me your cell phone.

16
00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.041
You have to unlock it for me.

17
00:01:10.032 --> 00:01:12.254
Oh, so you actually know how to
use a cell phone, eh?

18
00:01:12.254 --> 00:01:14.002
You're speaking informally to me again.

19
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.553
How's this one?

20
00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:24.157
What do you mean?

21
00:01:24.157 --> 00:01:25.784
Is this one an okay one to dance to?

22
00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:27.537
Why are you talking about
dancing all of the sudden?

23
00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:30.507
Practice the dance you'll be dancing
when you win.

24
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:32.353
You're so crazy!

25
00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:33.740
You mean, you haven't
gone crazy yet?

26
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.321
How do you expect to succeed
without being crazy?

27
00:01:37.845 --> 00:01:39.240
Who says that I'm not crazy?

28
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.692
I'm crazy too!
I'm crazy!

29
00:01:41.692 --> 00:01:43.499
But dancing is off-limits.

30
00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:47.243
Geez.

31
00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:57.195
This is my place.

32
00:01:57.195 --> 00:01:59.639
I have to keep heading up
that way.

33
00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.695
Goodbye, then.
And thank you for today.

34
00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:04.023
For what?

35
00:02:06.832 --> 00:02:08.448
What was I thankful for, again?

36
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.410
What was I thankful for, again?

37
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.001
I'll be going now.

38
00:02:17.172 --> 00:02:19.271
You made me feel better.

39
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:21.011
Head inside already.

40
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:22.855
I'm not going in!

41
00:02:33.932 --> 00:02:37.724
<i>[Temperature of Love]</i>

00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:42.484
<i>[Episode 3]</i>

43
00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:51.497
Hey.
Hey!

44
00:02:53.845 --> 00:02:55.938
How can you possibly be
sleeping right now?

45
00:02:55.938 --> 00:02:57.926
You're not a person.
You're a beast.

46
00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:01.026
Hey, hey, wake up already!

47
00:03:01.026 --> 00:03:02.383
You're so pathetic.

48
00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:05.154
How can you sleep, when you
didn't win the competition?

49
00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:07.860
If it were me, I would've bitten
my tongue and killed myself.

50
00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:15.621
Bitch.

51
00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:23.693
Where are you going? You have
to make breakfast and go to work!

52
00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:29.926
Don't you feel bad for spending all the
money I make while you have fun?

53
00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:32.914
Even worms squirm
if you step on them.

54
00:03:33.634 --> 00:03:34.969
I want rice!

55
00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:40.121
Geez, there isn't any.

56
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.734
Hey!

57
00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:47.633
Be careful! You're going
to get garbage on me!

58
00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:48.711
What?

59
00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:51.593
Ugh, why does the garbage drop-off
point have to be in front of our house?

60
00:03:51.593 --> 00:03:55.243
Because this spot is the most convenient
for everyone in the neighborhood.

61
00:03:57.932 --> 00:03:59.848
If only an ambassador
lived here, or something.

62
00:03:59.848 --> 00:04:02.547
They wouldn't have even dreamed
of putting something like this here.

63
00:04:02.547 --> 00:04:04.992
They call that the "not in my backyard"
kind of thinking.

64
00:04:04.992 --> 00:04:06.759
Even if it may be a bit
inconvenient for us

65
00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.944
you have to think of what's best
for the entire neighborhood...

66
00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:10.733
They call that the "not in my backyard"
kind of thinking.

67
00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:12.505
How dare you try to educate me?

68
00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:15.878
This is why you keep
losing the competition.

69
00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:17.756
How are you going to
write anything good

70
00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:19.480
when you know nothing
about people's feelings?

71
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.804
You need a good smacking.

72
00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:23.831
I've been holding back
for a really long time now.

73
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:27.420
I accepted all the insults you threw
at me because I couldn't pay the bills.

74
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.132
But not anymore.

75
00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:30.990
What are you going to do, then?

76
00:04:32.307 --> 00:04:34.014
I know you.

77
00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:36.636
And what you fear the most, too.

78
00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:38.709
What?

79
00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:41.386
What other people think of you,
and maintaining your dignity!

80
00:04:41.386 --> 00:04:42.735
Well, prepare to lose it all today!

81
00:04:42.735 --> 00:04:44.545
Hey, hey, hey!
Let go!

82
00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:48.033
Hey, stop it! Hey, come on!
All right, I'll stop!

83
00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:49.738
People are watching!

84
00:04:49.738 --> 00:04:52.033
Good, because I'm doing this
for them to watch.

85
00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:54.740
Hello, this is my younger sister
and she's a teacher!

86
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.439
- Why, you little...
- Ow! Ow!

87
00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:59.165
- Hey, let go.
- You let go first!

88
00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:03.374
- Hey, let go! Let go!
- Ow! Ow!

89
00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:10.394
You're supposed to be
my older sister!

90
00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:11.975
You're supposed
to be the older one!

91
00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:13.795
So why did you go
and piss me off, huh?

92
00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:17.122
I'm not scared of anything!
I don't care if people stare...

93
00:05:20.023 --> 00:05:21.160
Hello.

94
00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:32.535
Hello.

95
00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.887
This is my younger sister.

96
00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:38.288
- Oh.
- Hey!

97
00:05:39.343 --> 00:05:42.762
I guess you two have a special way of
expressing your love toward each other?

98
00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:48.040
Oh, I love her more.
Like, violently.

99
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.084
Oh.

100
00:05:49.084 --> 00:05:51.079
Well, I'll be going now.

101
00:05:54.932 --> 00:05:57.641
All right, let's get everything
ready for service!

102
00:05:57.641 --> 00:05:58.740
- Yes, Chef!
- Yes, Chef!

103
00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:05.036
Did you check on the batter?

104
00:06:05.036 --> 00:06:08.554
Of course. I just need three more
servings of potato purée.

105
00:06:08.554 --> 00:06:09.841
Mr. Sung Hwan!

106
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:12.004
Please get ready to make purée
after prepping for lunch service.

107
00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.160
All right.

108
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.024
Why are you so giddy?

109
00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:17.735
Looks like you're over the moon about
your sole meuniere being a success.

110
00:06:17.735 --> 00:06:19.442
You need more sole too, right?

111
00:06:19.442 --> 00:06:21.062
I've finished prepping
the ones for dinner.

112
00:06:21.062 --> 00:06:22.863
And I'll stop taking orders
when we run out of sole.

113
00:06:22.863 --> 00:06:25.437
I got all of the fresh sole
from the fish market.

114
00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:36.016
What's so delicious about that
tasteless thing?

115
00:06:36.016 --> 00:06:38.102
Wow, people have
really weird taste.

116
00:06:38.102 --> 00:06:39.699
Mr. Ohn Jung Seon!

117
00:06:41.228 --> 00:06:44.105
It's a gift, and the sender
is the VVIP!

118
00:06:45.367 --> 00:06:46.922
Hurry up and open it!

119
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:48.881
What kind of job does
the VVIP have?

120
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:50.064
He's a very rich businessman.

121
00:06:50.064 --> 00:06:51.516
Hey, stay out of this.

122
00:06:58.055 --> 00:06:59.545
What are those?
Are those truffles?

123
00:07:01.872 --> 00:07:03.802
- These are worth over a million won!
- What?

124
00:07:03.802 --> 00:07:05.651
What do you mean, one million?
It's at least two million!

125
00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:07.521
This guy is gay.
One hundred present.

126
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:10.047
Why else would he give another
man such an expensive gift?

127
00:07:10.047 --> 00:07:11.863
Well, maybe because
the food was good.

128
00:07:11.863 --> 00:07:13.211
What do you mean, it was good!

129
00:07:13.211 --> 00:07:16.261
Hey, are you going to
eat those by yourself?

130
00:07:18.497 --> 00:07:19.908
Where is he?

131
00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:25.240
Excuse me!

132
00:07:26.956 --> 00:07:28.588
I'd usually accept gifts, but...

133
00:07:29.096 --> 00:07:30.223
this is way too much.

134
00:07:30.223 --> 00:07:32.221
A gift is supposed to be a reflection
of a person's feelings.

135
00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:34.278
And my feelings exceed that.

136
00:07:34.278 --> 00:07:35.961
I'm your fan.

137
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:37.785
I'm going to leave it here.

138
00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:43.144
Are you afraid of being loved?

139
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:44.946
Are you teasing me?

140
00:07:45.954 --> 00:07:47.610
Do my honest feelings
sound like a joke to you?

141
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.550
Ugh, hearing that makes me cringe.

142
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.093
Why are you acting this way?

143
00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:53.297
It does make me cringe a bit too.

144
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.242
If I have something

145
00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:58.274
that I think would suit
someone else a lot better

146
00:07:58.274 --> 00:07:59.480
I can't keep it for myself

147
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.790
because I keep thinking
of that person.

148
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.574
That sounds weird and
makes me cringe too.

149
00:08:03.574 --> 00:08:07.391
This is weird. Why do I keep saying
things I say when I'm seducing women?

150
00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:11.283
My name is Park Jung Woo.
What's your name?

151
00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:13.673
You don't even know my name, and
yet you gave me such a lavish gift?

152
00:08:13.673 --> 00:08:15.189
These are my feelings.

153
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:18.076
Chefs usually love getting
ingredients as gifts.

154
00:08:18.076 --> 00:08:19.300
But I guess you don't.

155
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.350
I only said that it was too much.
I never said I didn't like it.

156
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.259
Being aggressive toward someone being
kind to you means one of two things.

157
00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:28.086
Either you really like them,
or really dislike them.

158
00:08:28.086 --> 00:08:29.925
My name is Ohn Jung Seon.

159
00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:31.752
Ohn? That's an actual last name?

160
00:08:31.752 --> 00:08:33.531
You know, like General Ohn Dal.

161
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:36.474
Oh, are you one of Ohn Dal's
descendants, then?

162
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.579
I'm a Gyeongju Ohn, and I'm
Ohn Goon Hye's descendant.

163
00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:40.367
They were killed by Empress Jindeok
during the Shilla Era.

164
00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:42.040
They died at the hands of a Goguryeo
soldier, instead of King Taejong.

165
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.934
They'd been on their way back from
following King Taejong to China.

166
00:08:44.934 --> 00:08:48.102
This is only the kind of thing you'd be
hearing if you lived with your grandpa.

167
00:08:48.102 --> 00:08:49.188
Did you live with your grandfather?

168
00:08:49.188 --> 00:08:50.544
No, but he loved me quite a bit.

169
00:08:50.544 --> 00:08:52.335
I'm an only child, and the eldest son.

170
00:08:52.335 --> 00:08:54.147
They must have been opposed to you
pursuing the culinary arts then

171
00:08:54.147 --> 00:08:55.443
saying that it was no job for a man.

172
00:08:55.443 --> 00:08:58.617
My father was against it.
But my grandfather was always on my side.

173
00:08:58.617 --> 00:09:00.320
And he was hard on my dad.

174
00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:04.574
Do you like me, or something?
Why are you telling me about yourself?

175
00:09:04.574 --> 00:09:08.387
Are you the type to talk about yourself
a lot to people you've just met?

176
00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:10.210
I don't like careless
people like that.

177
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.963
Do you know that you're a bit strange?
I'm serious about this.

178
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.926
I know.

179
00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:17.819
Look at the business card
I gave to you.

180
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.088
"On Entertainment."

181
00:09:21.813 --> 00:09:23.511
For 10 years

182
00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:28.099
I'd planned on using that name when
I opened an entertainment company.

183
00:09:28.099 --> 00:09:31.197
Always stay on.
On!

184
00:09:31.197 --> 00:09:33.608
But as soon as I heard
the name "Ohn Jung Seon"

185
00:09:33.608 --> 00:09:35.032
I feel like I've lost.
Why?

186
00:09:35.032 --> 00:09:36.276
Oh!

187
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.423
I probably won't be able
to win against him.

188
00:09:39.423 --> 00:09:41.058
Why not?

189
00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:42.853
Is it because I have "Ohn"
in my name?

190
00:09:44.237 --> 00:09:45.508
Bingo!

191
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.127
I'd like for us to be friends.

192
00:09:49.127 --> 00:09:52.386
Do you have any thoughts of
opening your own restaurant?

193
00:09:52.386 --> 00:09:54.166
I'd be interested in investing.

194
00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:56.257
You really do get ahead of
yourself a lot.

195
00:09:56.257 --> 00:09:58.400
Thank you for enjoying my cooking.

196
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.013
All right, that'll be all for today.

197
00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:02.654
All right, then.

198
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.950
Wait!

199
00:10:12.058 --> 00:10:13.723
Can you please do me
a favor...

200
00:10:14.176 --> 00:10:15.962
and accept this?

201
00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:25.521
- Hyun Soo.
- Huh?

202
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:27.486
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be on the set?

203
00:10:27.486 --> 00:10:29.863
And the director is here.
Hello!

204
00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:30.863
Yep.

205
00:10:31.758 --> 00:10:33.695
It looks like he's in a really bad mood.

206
00:10:33.695 --> 00:10:35.049
Why aren't you guys out shooting?

207
00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:37.314
He says that he can't shoot
with that script.

208
00:10:37.314 --> 00:10:39.417
Oh my gosh!
Does Writer Park know?

209
00:10:39.417 --> 00:10:41.049
Hey, Joon Ha!

210
00:10:41.049 --> 00:10:43.877
This isn't the time for you to be
chitchatting. Get over here!

211
00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:44.930
Yes, sir!

212
00:10:46.664 --> 00:10:49.256
With lavender and crushed berries...

213
00:10:53.933 --> 00:10:55.617
Make potato purée.

214
00:10:55.617 --> 00:10:57.771
The youngest cook said
he'd do it, though.

215
00:10:57.771 --> 00:11:00.197
You do it. Since when have
you been a stickler for rules?

216
00:11:00.197 --> 00:11:02.936
But making him prep ingredients
helps him grow as a cook.

217
00:11:02.936 --> 00:11:06.561
Just do as I say! You're in
no position to be training people!

218
00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:08.146
Excuse me!

219
00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:09.729
Hey, Jung Seon.

220
00:11:10.715 --> 00:11:13.150
Hello, I'm Choi Won Joon,
Jung Seon's senior.

221
00:11:14.202 --> 00:11:17.112
Hey, why do people keep
coming to look for you here?

222
00:11:17.112 --> 00:11:18.579
Do you drink a lot of
alcohol, by any chance?

223
00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:19.718
Why?

224
00:11:19.718 --> 00:11:21.286
Because you seem
a bit jaundiced.

225
00:11:21.286 --> 00:11:22.597
Just a moment.

226
00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:26.772
Don't worry.
I'm a doctor.

227
00:11:29.609 --> 00:11:32.314
You get dark circles and really severe
fatigue if you push yourself, right?

228
00:11:32.314 --> 00:11:35.041
Huh? Um, yes.

229
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:36.938
Is... something wrong with me?

230
00:11:36.938 --> 00:11:38.809
I don't think your liver is
doing very well.

231
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:41.489
My liver...
my liver!

232
00:11:41.489 --> 00:11:43.191
It could just be temporary fatigue

233
00:11:43.191 --> 00:11:45.097
but you should go to a doctor
if you want to know for sure.

234
00:11:45.097 --> 00:11:47.328
Oh... all right!

235
00:11:47.777 --> 00:11:49.612
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

236
00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:53.542
Goodbye!

237
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.285
Is he really sick?

238
00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:00.036
Oh, as if.

239
00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:02.333
I just said that since I figured that
he's the type to drink a lot.

240
00:12:03.147 --> 00:12:06.104
Are you seriously worried for him?
He was being so mean to you, though.

241
00:12:06.104 --> 00:12:08.541
They are separate matters.

242
00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:09.647
Want me to hit him for you?

243
00:12:09.647 --> 00:12:11.151
If I were going to tell you to do that,
I would've already done it myself!

244
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.327
How are your knife skills so good?

245
00:12:15.327 --> 00:12:17.371
- This is so easy... ow!
- Hey!

246
00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:18.449
Are you okay?

247
00:12:18.449 --> 00:12:20.674
This always happens when
I'm trying to show off.

248
00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:22.411
Karma really loves me.

249
00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:25.520
So, there's no such thing
as karma, huh?

250
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.864
Didn't you tell me that you'd show us how
a nice guy would get revenge?

251
00:12:30.864 --> 00:12:32.463
And I'm showing you, Director.

252
00:12:32.463 --> 00:12:34.775
If he takes crampons and scratches up
the other guy's face with them

253
00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:37.550
it'll be no different than
other revenge dramas!

254
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.318
I didn't know you were like this, but
you have a violent side to you, huh?

255
00:12:40.318 --> 00:12:44.141
It's not that I'm violent.
That's just how human nature is!

256
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:46.275
And I'm doing a faithful
depiction of that!

257
00:12:46.275 --> 00:12:48.996
So are you saying that you're
going to go with this, then?

258
00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:51.324
I mean, um...

259
00:12:51.324 --> 00:12:53.896
Joon Ha, say what you
told me before.

260
00:12:53.896 --> 00:12:55.123
What?

261
00:12:55.123 --> 00:12:57.190
You mean, how I said
that it wasn't entertaining?

262
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.805
Ow! What are you doing?

263
00:12:58.805 --> 00:12:59.896
What do you mean?

264
00:13:03.377 --> 00:13:05.156
Writer Park.

265
00:13:05.156 --> 00:13:07.589
Remember what we talked about
when we first began?

266
00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:10.257
We said the theme would be, "a person's
character will never become corrupted!"

267
00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:13.289
You said that you'd show me how
a good guy would prevail!

268
00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:16.733
So, what is this? Why did you give up
on what you said you'd do?

269
00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:18.959
To be honest, that's still
kind of the theme, but...

270
00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:26.358
It does seem that there's some
unpleasantness in the script

271
00:13:26.358 --> 00:13:27.755
so I'll change it.

272
00:13:35.243 --> 00:13:36.431
Wow, you're good.

273
00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:38.405
I told you, my original dream
was to become a chef.

274
00:13:38.405 --> 00:13:40.526
So why didn't you want to
do it anymore?

275
00:13:40.526 --> 00:13:42.207
My parents said no.

276
00:13:42.207 --> 00:13:44.003
My dad's dream
is for all three of his sons

277
00:13:44.003 --> 00:13:45.800
to open clinics in the same building.

278
00:13:46.934 --> 00:13:50.439
So you decided that your dream would
be to make your dad's dream come true?

279
00:13:51.862 --> 00:13:53.516
Come to think of it,
you're right.

280
00:13:53.516 --> 00:13:55.041
Well, that's nice, too.

281
00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:57.209
No matter what your dream is,
you need to make it come true.

282
00:13:57.209 --> 00:14:00.290
Are you happy about you doing what you
want while I'm stuck with my dad's dream?

283
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.693
Just don't do it, then.

284
00:14:01.693 --> 00:14:03.335
Yeah, all I have to do
is not do it!

285
00:14:03.335 --> 00:14:05.660
But that's easier said than done!

286
00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.311
I'm the eldest grandson
of the eldest son in my family.

287
00:14:07.311 --> 00:14:08.550
And they're in Andong.

288
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.930
Do you think it was easy for me?

289
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.761
It's because you only think but
don't act that it's hard.

290
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:13.952
Really?

291
00:14:13.952 --> 00:14:16.149
Wow, you're so amazing, you punk!

292
00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:17.625
Stop it! Ow!

293
00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:19.223
- Ow!
- You okay?

294
00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:23.808
<i>Are you coming to Seoul this weekend?</i>

295
00:14:23.808 --> 00:14:26.598
<i>No. I only came today
because I have the day off.</i>

296
00:14:26.598 --> 00:14:28.205
It's Hong Ah.

297
00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:31.301
I like her, but I'm nothing
more than a nameless weed to her.

298
00:14:31.301 --> 00:14:33.050
A nameless weed.

299
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.704
Not even a wildflower, but a weed.

300
00:14:34.704 --> 00:14:37.463
I wonder what a nameless
weed tastes like.

301
00:14:37.463 --> 00:14:38.977
I wonder if they're okay to eat?

302
00:14:38.977 --> 00:14:41.661
I'm talking about my love life,
but you're talking about cooking?

303
00:14:42.933 --> 00:14:45.005
<i>[Scene 15: Inside the Lawyer's Office]</i>

304
00:14:46.933 --> 00:14:49.627
<i>I'm coming out of the courthouse now.</i>

305
00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:56.113
"Kyung Soo goes outside."

306
00:14:56.113 --> 00:14:58.511
Hm, what does he do
after going outside?

307
00:15:04.359 --> 00:15:06.074
I didn't order this.

308
00:15:19.132 --> 00:15:20.399
You must be a writer.

309
00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:22.021
No, not yet.

310
00:15:22.675 --> 00:15:24.513
Are you submitting work to
SBC Broadcasting Station?

311
00:15:24.513 --> 00:15:27.612
My uncle is a PD at SBC.

312
00:15:27.612 --> 00:15:29.233
Oh, really?

313
00:15:32.792 --> 00:15:34.756
I can introduce you to him
if you want to.

314
00:15:39.473 --> 00:15:40.564
What are you doing?

315
00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:42.357
I asked you what you're doing!

316
00:15:42.357 --> 00:15:43.530
Can't you tell?

317
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.669
No, I mean, why are you leaving?
We were having such a good time!

318
00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:49.375
Hey, when was I ever
having a good time with you?

319
00:15:49.375 --> 00:15:52.553
How dare you worm your way in here
after only buying me one drink?

320
00:15:52.553 --> 00:15:54.445
What?
Hey!

321
00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:56.338
You're the one who
flirted with me first!

322
00:15:56.338 --> 00:15:59.659
You were working on "Kyung Soo
goes outside" for two hours.

323
00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:01.270
Ugh, you asshole!

324
00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:03.607
Ugh!

325
00:16:03.607 --> 00:16:06.050
You bought it, so you can have it.

326
00:16:07.511 --> 00:16:09.777
Ugh... ugh!

327
00:16:10.573 --> 00:16:12.496
Geez.

328
00:16:12.496 --> 00:16:14.212
Writer Park.

329
00:16:14.212 --> 00:16:16.829
Did you see the director out?

330
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:20.377
Yeah. Why are you out here?

331
00:16:21.346 --> 00:16:22.771
Just because.

332
00:16:23.673 --> 00:16:27.952
What the director said is similar
to what I wanted to say.

333
00:16:27.952 --> 00:16:31.645
It's the same thing I wanted
to say to all of you before

334
00:16:31.645 --> 00:16:33.781
but he's just expressing it
in a different way, is all.

335
00:16:33.781 --> 00:16:34.940
I see.

336
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.454
Hello, Writer Park!

337
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:38.517
Oh, Hong Ah!
What brings you here?

338
00:16:38.517 --> 00:16:41.377
I can never get in touch with Hyun Soo
and she's always busy

339
00:16:41.377 --> 00:16:42.832
so I came to see her instead!

340
00:16:42.832 --> 00:16:45.294
Aren't you taking advantage
of her too much?

341
00:16:45.294 --> 00:16:47.034
Is that what you go around
telling people?

342
00:16:47.034 --> 00:16:48.781
That it's hard because
I'm taking advantage of you?

343
00:16:49.303 --> 00:16:51.299
- No, Writer Park!
- No, Writer Park!

344
00:16:51.299 --> 00:16:53.142
I'm just kidding!

345
00:16:53.142 --> 00:16:56.234
It's just that she works so hard
that I came to cheer her on.

346
00:16:56.234 --> 00:16:58.181
Of course you need to be
saying that.

347
00:16:58.181 --> 00:16:59.818
You're the one who introduced her to me.

348
00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:01.646
I trusted you when
I hired her.

349
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:05.594
My uncle praises your work a lot.

350
00:17:05.594 --> 00:17:08.579
He said that there isn't a more
skilled writer in this genre.

351
00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.838
Thanks.

352
00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:12.765
Ugh, I really need to hear
encouraging things nowadays.

353
00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.432
Oh, you can go now since Hong Ah is here.

354
00:17:15.432 --> 00:17:17.673
No, it's okay.
If you need to make changes...

355
00:17:17.673 --> 00:17:19.498
I don't need you here.
I have the other girls.

356
00:17:19.498 --> 00:17:20.885
It was nice seeing you again.

357
00:17:20.885 --> 00:17:22.687
Go and have a good time
with Hyun Soo.

358
00:17:22.687 --> 00:17:24.764
Yes, Writer Park.
Thank you!

359
00:17:29.133 --> 00:17:31.966
Did something happen?
Geez, how scary.

360
00:17:31.966 --> 00:17:33.338
She looked really angry.

361
00:17:34.515 --> 00:17:36.663
Things may suck now, but
endure it until the end!

362
00:17:36.663 --> 00:17:38.098
It'll be so embarrassing
if you're fired.

363
00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:40.685
There won't be any place for you to go
if you're fired as an assistant writer.

364
00:17:41.607 --> 00:17:43.043
I'm going to head inside.

365
00:17:43.544 --> 00:17:45.264
You can't go in there now!

366
00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:46.667
But you told me to endure!

367
00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:49.018
She'll be more annoyed
if you hang around.

368
00:17:49.018 --> 00:17:51.084
Just take a breather
before you go back in there.

369
00:17:51.594 --> 00:17:53.933
You sure do know a lot.

370
00:17:53.933 --> 00:17:57.283
This is why you need me.
Do you know that?

371
00:17:57.283 --> 00:17:58.665
I do.

372
00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:02.620
But do you know what it is
that I need right now?

373
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.297
Wow, this is awesome!

374
00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:10.744
Are you happy?

375
00:18:10.744 --> 00:18:12.327

00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:31.873
I feel a bit better now, too.

381
00:18:31.873 --> 00:18:33.560
Were you in a bad mood?

382
00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.684
Yeah.

383
00:18:35.332 --> 00:18:37.530
Why, are things not going well
with that lawyer?

384
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.563
He's always trying to show off
how smart he is

385
00:18:39.563 --> 00:18:41.184
and he's only polished
on the outside.

386
00:18:44.494 --> 00:18:45.556
Is it that guy?

387

<i>[Lawyer]</i>

388
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.883
Why did you put him in under his
occupation, and not his name?

389
00:18:48.883 --> 00:18:49.954
There are tons of lawyers.

Only the best guys

my phone under their name.

Why does it sound like
you're a bit lonely to me?

You really do know me well.

I really like you!

Geez, what's this, all of the sudden?

396
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.916
All my friends tell me that my problems
are non-issues.

397
00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:12.604
They dismiss them, since I don't
have to worry about working.

398
00:19:12.604 --> 00:19:14.128
They treat me like an idiot.

399
00:19:14.128 --> 00:19:17.032
But the issue with you is that
you think too much.

400
00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:18.274
Yeah.

401
00:19:18.274 --> 00:19:22.250
That's why I'll become a writer,
no matter what!

402
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.049
I'll become a writer,
and show them!

403
00:19:26.049 --> 00:19:28.601
It's not like being a writer
is an amazing job.

404
00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:30.375
At the very least, my family
will be impressed.

405
00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:32.075
My family likes writers.

406
00:19:32.075 --> 00:19:33.772
My family doesn't, though.

407
00:19:34.244 --> 00:19:39.022
Why did I end up doing a job
that rich people like?

408
00:19:40.588 --> 00:19:43.525
All right, I'll be giving you
the full course today!

Bye!

I thought you were going on a diet.
Is it okay for you to eat that?

422
00:20:30.338 --> 00:20:33.176
My blood sugar got low because
I saw something gross.

Are you two dating?
Why were you hugging her?

Do you like her more than your
real younger sister?

425
00:20:38.224 --> 00:20:41.194
There you go again.
Hey, Sister.

426

00:23:37.311 --> 00:23:39.906
Most people don't bring their work
home with them, so to speak.

473
00:23:39.906 --> 00:23:42.752
Don't most chefs not cook at home?

474
00:23:42.752 --> 00:23:44.290
Well, I do.

475
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.674
Geez, you're so stubborn.

476
00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:53.059
Um, do you have any sweet pumpkins?
I want one all of the sudden.

477
00:23:53.059 --> 00:23:54.834
- No, I don't.
- Oh.

478
00:23:54.834 --> 00:23:57.190
But don't you worry.
I have something really amazing.

479
00:24:04.895 --> 00:24:08.405
That person may be good-looking,
but has no charisma. (In Japanese)

480
00:24:08.974 --> 00:24:11.654
I don't think he'd be a good
fit for our group.

481
00:24:11.654 --> 00:24:15.330
<i>Understood.
I'll keep looking.</i>

482
00:24:16.194 --> 00:24:20.664
Thanks for your hard work.
Bye.

483
00:24:28.738 --> 00:24:30.900
You're starting over, Park Jung Woo.

484
00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:34.981
You'll win.

485
00:24:35.664 --> 00:24:37.861
Because you've always won.

486
00:24:59.552 --> 00:25:00.829
What is that?

487
00:25:00.829 --> 00:25:02.013
It's a truffle.

488
00:25:02.013 --> 00:25:04.070
These don't grow at all in Korea.

489
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:08.188
And even in France, they grow so far
underground that they're hard to harvest.

490
00:25:08.188 --> 00:25:11.274
Wow, it must be super expensive, then.

491
00:25:11.964 --> 00:25:14.671
Do your parents own a large
conglomerate, by any chance?

492
00:25:14.671 --> 00:25:17.119
No. I got them as a gift.

493
00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:19.818
It must be nice to receive
such expensive gifts.

494
00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:24.676
But, can I ask you one thing?

495
00:25:24.676 --> 00:25:26.397
You can ask me many things.

496
00:25:26.397 --> 00:25:27.989
It's kind of a sensitive
topic, though.

497
00:25:29.479 --> 00:25:31.204
How much do you make per month?

498
00:25:31.204 --> 00:25:33.558
Just so you know, I make 800,000
per month. There, I told you first.

499
00:25:34.734 --> 00:25:35.756
1.5 million won.

500
00:25:37.635 --> 00:25:39.261
Psh.

501
00:25:39.378 --> 00:25:42.844
You make more than me,
even though I'm older than you.

502
00:25:43.094 --> 00:25:45.553
But still, can you maintain this kind
of lifestyle with that salary?

503
00:25:45.553 --> 00:25:46.724
If I use it all, then yes.

504
00:25:46.724 --> 00:25:48.205
Oh, so you're bad at budgeting, huh?

505
00:25:48.205 --> 00:25:49.386
No, I'm actually amazing at it.

506
00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:52.345
But I decided that now is the time to
spend money instead of saving it.

507
00:25:55.377 --> 00:25:57.498
Since when were you
so shrewd?

508
00:25:57.498 --> 00:26:00.614
Since I was 15, after
my parents got divorced.

509
00:26:09.193 --> 00:26:10.646
Here.

510
00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.138
We will now commence with the enjoyment
of these rare and expensive truffles.

511
00:26:14.138 --> 00:26:15.914
My thanks to the one who
gave these to you.

512
00:26:24.815 --> 00:26:25.983
Hm.

513
00:26:25.983 --> 00:26:29.734
I've never tasted anything
like this before.

514
00:26:29.734 --> 00:26:31.724
I bet it doesn't
taste that good.

515
00:26:32.704 --> 00:26:34.638
So it's not just me, right?

516
00:26:35.194 --> 00:26:36.715
It's a really unique taste
but I didn't want it

517
00:26:36.715 --> 00:26:38.169
to be obvious that my
palate isn't refined

518
00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:39.213
so I went a bit overboard.

519
00:26:39.213 --> 00:26:41.272
It didn't taste that good.

520
00:26:42.194 --> 00:26:43.835
This will probably taste
different, though.

521
00:26:53.868 --> 00:26:56.027
Wow, that's good!

522
00:26:59.402 --> 00:27:01.234
Clink!

523
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.274
Hm.

524
00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:15.173
Oh, this reminds me of
when we were dating.

525
00:27:15.173 --> 00:27:16.848
Did we do things like this
when we were dating?

526
00:27:16.848 --> 00:27:18.694
We did this!

527
00:27:18.694 --> 00:27:20.675
Nope.

528
00:27:21.311 --> 00:27:24.548
Do you want me to
make you remember

529
00:27:24.548 --> 00:27:28.386
how it actually was back then,
Mr. Lee Min Jae?

530
00:27:28.386 --> 00:27:30.335
Wait, Honey!
Honey!

531
00:27:31.895 --> 00:27:33.700
What are you doing?

532
00:27:37.598 --> 00:27:39.900
What are you doing?
People can see us.

533
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.056
Do you realize now that you're
not remembering things correctly?

534
00:27:44.407 --> 00:27:45.763
Yeah.

535
00:27:48.031 --> 00:27:50.367
This really brings me back.

536
00:27:57.194 --> 00:27:58.667
What are you doing?

537
00:27:58.667 --> 00:28:02.258
You always talk so much
at moments like these.

538
00:28:20.194 --> 00:28:21.463
Why did you do that?

539
00:28:21.463 --> 00:28:24.521
How dare you go parading around
with someone else's man?

540
00:28:24.521 --> 00:28:26.963
Does your husband know that
you go around doing this?

541
00:28:26.963 --> 00:28:29.040
This is my husband!

542
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.385
Ugh, the cheaters are
always great at lying.

543
00:28:32.385 --> 00:28:33.725
Let's go, Honey.

544
00:28:33.725 --> 00:28:36.937
What do you mean? If we just leave now,
she'll really think we're cheaters!

545
00:28:36.937 --> 00:28:38.984
Wow, "Honey"?

546
00:28:38.984 --> 00:28:41.227
Ugh, you disgusting vermin!

547
00:28:41.227 --> 00:28:43.359
Ah!
Stop it!

548
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.159
(Episode 4 will air shortly.)
