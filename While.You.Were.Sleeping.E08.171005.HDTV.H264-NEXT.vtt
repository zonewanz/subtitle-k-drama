00:00:14.518 --> 00:00:16.918
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.649
Let's go.

3
00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.629
Wait. Hey, Woo Tak.

4
00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:36.998
What? I'll be there.

5
00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:41.228
I'm here to be investigated as a witness. I'm Bong Du Hyun.

6
00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:45.139
Have you checked if Park Jun Mo and the witness are on their ways?

7
00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:47.738
Yes, I heard that they won't be late.

8
00:00:50.778 --> 00:00:52.248
Hey. I've just arrived.

9
00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:54.919
That's not easy.

10
00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:56.518
Pardon? May I help you?

11
00:00:57.248 --> 00:01:00.248
I'm Lieutenant Oh Kyung Hwan. I'm the witness.

12
00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:01.719
You came too early.

13
00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:03.788
Could you wait outside? I'll call you in later.

14
00:01:03.788 --> 00:01:05.758
Okay. Oh, by the way,

15
00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.998
somebody wanted to talk to Prosecutor Jung.

16
00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:09.828
- Me? - Yes.

17
00:01:10.058 --> 00:01:13.768
This is Lieutenant Han Woo Tak. He said it's really urgent.

18
00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:17.768
Hello? This is Prosecutor Jung.

19
00:01:17.798 --> 00:01:19.869
Oh, I didn't have your number.

20
00:01:20.308 --> 00:01:22.038
You haven't investigated on Park Jun Mo yet, have you?

21
00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:25.109
- I haven't. - When you investigate him later,

22
00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:26.949
don't do it yourself. Make the investigator do it.

23
00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.149
Pardon?

24
00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:31.988
Why should I do that?

25
00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:33.518
Just listen to him.

26
00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.459
I don't know why either,

27
00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:39.028
but both of us dreamed of you investigating Park Jun Mo.

28
00:01:39.288 --> 00:01:41.599
In my dream, Park Jun Mo wasn't charged of anything,

29
00:01:41.798 --> 00:01:43.228
but in Woo Tak's, he was prosecuted.

30
00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:44.768
That's nonsense.

31
00:01:44.768 --> 00:01:46.328
So we compared our dreams,

32
00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.139
and we realized everything was the same, except for one.

33
00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:50.599
In Hong Joo's dream, you investigated Park Jun Mo.

34
00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:53.109
In mine, the investigator did it.

35
00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:56.008
You know, the one who looks like a fish.

36
00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:01.078
Gosh, are you sure? Maybe you're mistaken.

37
00:02:01.548 --> 00:02:04.149
My dear, Mr. Choi. We're not late, are we?

38
00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:08.518
Gosh, Ms. Moon. You look great in yellow.

39
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.258
You are never late.

40
00:02:13.288 --> 00:02:16.859
I asked him if we could do it on the document, but he didn't listen.

41
00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:19.828
He wanted to do it face to face. Goodness.

42
00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:20.828
It's okay.

43
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.639
Mr. Choi is really close with Yu Beom. They're like family.

44
00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.808
- He's really close. - There's no choice.

45
00:02:26.808 --> 00:02:27.838
The dream told us so.

46
00:02:28.578 --> 00:02:30.439
Park Jun Mo pleaded innocent.

47
00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.849
What? Are you crazy? That's a total nonsense!

48
00:02:36.048 --> 00:02:38.449
I mean, it doesn't make sense that he pleaded innocent...

49
00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.018
when there's so much evidence.

50
00:02:40.288 --> 00:02:42.588
Even so, you will not win Yu Beom.

51
00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.228
So let Mr. Choi do the job, please.

52
00:02:45.558 --> 00:02:46.728
Goodness.

53
00:02:47.528 --> 00:02:50.058
Excuse me, Prosecutor Jung. Are you going to be done soon?

54
00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:53.768
Okay. Hang up now.

55
00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.578
If I do the investigation, he'll walk free.

56
00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.449
If Mr. Choi does, then Park Jun Mo will be persecuted?

57
00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.149
That's nonsense.

58
00:03:09.978 --> 00:03:11.048
Have a seat.

59
00:03:11.318 --> 00:03:14.419
I can't trust Mr. Choi. Gosh.

60
00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.429
Can I have my phone back? It's mine.

61
00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:20.988
Here.

62
00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.268
Prosecutor Jung, aren't you going to investigate them?

63
00:03:27.028 --> 00:03:28.998
- Mr. Choi. - Yes?

64
00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.508
I think you should do the investigation.

65
00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:47.818
Why are our dreams different?

66
00:03:48.488 --> 00:03:50.588
That means one of ours is wrong.

67
00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.488
Have your dreams ever been wrong?

68
00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.429
No, not until I met Jae Chan.

69
00:03:55.498 --> 00:03:56.599
What about after you met him?

70
00:03:58.028 --> 00:04:00.469
The dreams changed, thanks to him.

71
00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.838
(Hong Joo's dream began to change.)

72
00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.439
I hope that's the case this time.

73
00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.508
I know. I hope your dream is correct.

74
00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:21.919
Well, have you all had lunch yet?

75
00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:24.219
I just had whatever.

76
00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:27.728
All right. The victim,

77
00:04:27.728 --> 00:04:31.768
Ms. Do Geum Sook, wanted you to be punished, so things got complicated.

78
00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.338
As you well know, even though it's an injury,

79
00:04:35.338 --> 00:04:37.099
if the victim wants...

80
00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.369
I've never hit my wife.

81
00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:43.808
He really is pleading innocent.

82
00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:45.679
Is it going like Woo Tak's dream?

83
00:04:45.778 --> 00:04:48.949
Look. What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

84
00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.048
Wait. Hold on.

85
00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.088
Didn't you admit hitting your wife?

86
00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:55.219
Actually, I told him to admit it.

87
00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:58.389
- Sorry? - Considering his previous cases,

88
00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.458
I wanted him to just admit it first. But when I looked at the case,

89
00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:04.798
he was just caught in his wife's scheme.

90
00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:05.898
Scheme?

91
00:05:09.398 --> 00:05:12.269
This is the promise he made in the previous case.

92
00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:15.208
It says there that if he hits his wife again,

93
00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:16.809
he'll give her 100 million dollars.

94
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.979
So his wife fabricated her injuries to receive that money?

95
00:05:21.778 --> 00:05:24.619
That's right. I didn't want to believe it too.

96
00:05:27.048 --> 00:05:30.119
Do you think she can't survive without her husband?

97
00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:31.488
Don't be scared.

98
00:05:31.758 --> 00:05:33.458
After you get divorced, divide the property...

99
00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.128
and receive child support expenses from him.

100
00:05:35.358 --> 00:05:38.429
That's right. The documents are ready too.

101
00:05:52.278 --> 00:05:55.119
So that's how it happened. Now I get it.

102
00:05:55.418 --> 00:05:57.949
I've dealt with many cases like this one, so I know well.

103
00:05:58.048 --> 00:06:00.418
This isn't just a story that you can watch in dramas.

104
00:06:00.418 --> 00:06:02.318
This happens in the reality too.

105
00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:05.688
You hit your wife and write a promise...

106
00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:07.688
that will eat you up.

107
00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:11.769
What kind of an investigation is this?

108
00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:14.199
How can you conclude after just listening to the offender?

109
00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:16.039
I saw it right in front of me.

110
00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.639
Her wife's blouse was full of his footprints from him stepping on her.

111
00:06:19.668 --> 00:06:21.338
I have something to say on that.

112
00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.608
They were not Mr. Park's footprints.

113
00:06:26.878 --> 00:06:27.909
What?

114
00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.418
In the report, it says the footprints are 285mm.

115
00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:35.488
Yes, it says 285mm.

116
00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:37.519
Mr. Park's size...

117
00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:40.858
Gosh.

118
00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:44.869
is 260mm.

119
00:06:48.068 --> 00:06:49.969
You're right. His foot size is 260mm.

120
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:52.708
That can't be...

121
00:06:52.708 --> 00:06:55.139
Did you arrest him without even checking his foot size?

122
00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:59.108
I was too busy controlling the crowd that I had no chance to.

123
00:06:59.108 --> 00:07:01.208
Even if you were busy, you should've done your job.

124
00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:03.749
The foot size alone can determine someone's sentence.

125
00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:07.349
Follow the manuals. How can you not know the basics?

126
00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:08.889
The first thing is for me to arrest him.

127
00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.519
Then, the crime scene investigators are in charge next.

128
00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:12.729
That's enough. Be quiet.

129
00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:14.329
Lawyer Lee.

130
00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:18.329
How are we going to handle this case?

131
00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:20.898
I'm afraid it has to be dealt this way.

132
00:07:21.338 --> 00:07:25.309
Ms. Do Geum Sook used the promise she got from the previous case,

133
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:27.269
and she was going to rip him off of money.

134
00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.508
She was looking for the chance,

135
00:07:31.008 --> 00:07:34.309
and she broke her ribs in a ski resort.

136
00:07:35.278 --> 00:07:38.249
She fabricates it as an assault case.

137
00:07:39.548 --> 00:07:42.789
That's why the medical report dates were wrong.

138
00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:45.028
And on the day of the recital, she secretly rubbed footprints...

139
00:07:45.028 --> 00:07:46.389
on her blouse.

140
00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:51.798
She decides to faint when there are many people watching.

141
00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:54.938
- Ms. Do. - Mom.

142
00:07:56.738 --> 00:07:59.539
My goodness, she did the job meticulously.

143
00:08:00.108 --> 00:08:01.579
What's wrong with Mr. Choi?

144
00:08:01.778 --> 00:08:03.909
Why is he just listening to that rubbish?

145
00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:06.809
Darn it. Should I trust his dream?

146
00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:12.148
I really loved my wife.

147
00:08:13.048 --> 00:08:17.059
After listening to Lawyer Lee, all the pieces fell into place.

148
00:08:17.219 --> 00:08:19.028
As you can see in the report,

149
00:08:19.028 --> 00:08:24.298
Mr. Park never admitted to assault. Not even once.

150
00:08:25.429 --> 00:08:27.329
Then did you arrest him based on the circumstances...

151
00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:28.639
when he denied assaulting her?

152
00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:30.969
Who would admit in that kind of situation?

153
00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:33.738
Have you seen anyone admitting to his own crime?

154
00:08:33.738 --> 00:08:36.708
Gosh, you shouldn't be so upset about it.

155
00:08:36.838 --> 00:08:37.878
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:37.938 --> 00:08:41.278
What did Mr. Park say when his wife fainted?

157
00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:44.648
He said he didn't do it.

158
00:08:45.648 --> 00:08:46.648
What about when he was being arrested?

159
00:08:46.648 --> 00:08:49.458
He also said that he didn't do it.

160
00:08:51.429 --> 00:08:52.528
I knew it.

161
00:08:54.999 --> 00:08:57.898
All the pieces are coming to their places.

162
00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:02.668
You must have thought it was unfair after being betrayed by your wife.

163
00:09:05.068 --> 00:09:06.738
Why did your wife do that?

164
00:09:08.008 --> 00:09:10.008
Let's see. Look here.

165
00:09:10.338 --> 00:09:13.778
Your beloved wife suddenly collapsed.

166
00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:19.418
As soon as she collapsed, you denied assaulting her.

167
00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:23.219
Then you got arrested. Am I right?

168
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:25.889
Prosecutor Jung.

169
00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.329
Am I the only one who thinks this is strange?

170
00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:33.398
Sorry?

171
00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:34.699
For me,

172
00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:37.539
I don't understand this part.

173
00:09:37.539 --> 00:09:41.508
I don't get why you insisted that you didn't hit her.

174
00:09:42.409 --> 00:09:44.238
That's really strange.

175
00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:50.119
That's right. I think that's strange too.

176
00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:54.488
Mr. Park. What was the first thing you said when your wife collapsed?

177
00:09:55.758 --> 00:09:57.289
I said I didn't do it.

178
00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:00.829
You love your wife, don't you?

179
00:10:00.929 --> 00:10:02.258
Of course I love her.

180
00:10:02.258 --> 00:10:04.099
- Mr. Park. - Please be quiet.

181
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:08.568
Your beloved wife suddenly collapsed,

182
00:10:08.738 --> 00:10:10.869
and the first thing you say is, "I didn't do it"?

183
00:10:11.369 --> 00:10:12.738
Well, that's...

184
00:10:12.909 --> 00:10:15.179
You should have asked if she's okay or yelled for help.

185
00:10:15.938 --> 00:10:17.708
Shouldn't you have said those?

186
00:10:22.349 --> 00:10:24.988
That's right. That's what you should have said.

187
00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:28.318
You should be worried first before making excuses.

188
00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:31.188
When the police arrived, you should have asked them to...

189
00:10:31.188 --> 00:10:32.729
catch the suspect, not make excuses.

190
00:10:32.729 --> 00:10:35.528
Of course, that's right. That's what normal people do.

191
00:10:35.628 --> 00:10:39.769
That's what was the most suspicious when I was arresting him.

192
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:42.869
No, I said that because everyone assumed that it was me who hit her.

193
00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:46.039
- Mr. Choi. - Yes, sir.

194
00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:48.938
This is what Mr. Bong here recorded...

195
00:10:48.938 --> 00:10:51.949
on the day the incident occurred.

196
00:10:52.909 --> 00:10:54.449
That's her plan.

197
00:10:55.619 --> 00:10:57.648
Many people support me.

198
00:10:57.849 --> 00:11:00.949
I'll do my best not to disappoint...

199
00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:02.318
- Mom. - Ms. Do.

200
00:11:02.318 --> 00:11:04.958
- Call an ambulance. Hurry! - Mom!

201
00:11:05.188 --> 00:11:06.188
What's this?

202
00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.929
I didn't do this.

203
00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:14.099
No one accused you of hitting her.

204
00:11:14.298 --> 00:11:16.269
You were busy covering the footprints.

205
00:11:16.938 --> 00:11:18.469
As if you are the one who stepped on her.

206
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:22.309
They... They aren't mine. You measured my foot size.

207
00:11:22.309 --> 00:11:24.749
Why did you take off your shoes when he was measuring?

208
00:11:26.048 --> 00:11:30.619
Lawyer Lee must have known that the shoes and feet differ in size.

209
00:11:33.219 --> 00:11:35.619
Put on your shoes. Let's measure it again.

210
00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:38.528
- Get up. - Let's do this.

211
00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.458
- Lift your foot. - Let me go.

212
00:11:40.458 --> 00:11:41.458
Gosh.

213
00:11:43.028 --> 00:11:45.729
It's... It's okay.

214
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:49.238
Are the footprints, the letter, and the recording...

215
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:51.539
all you have to prove your innocence?

216
00:11:52.108 --> 00:11:54.039
Ms. Moon, could you bring that cart over here?

217
00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:55.039
Yes, sir.

218
00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:02.119
Are these all the evidences?

219
00:12:04.249 --> 00:12:06.619
I think you have taken the wrong path.

220
00:12:06.918 --> 00:12:09.389
If you keep lying with the fabricated evidence,

221
00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:11.588
they may work against you later.

222
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:15.458
- I just... - Don't answer him.

223
00:12:17.929 --> 00:12:19.298
Please wrap up for today.

224
00:12:19.298 --> 00:12:20.298
Make a choice.

225
00:12:20.898 --> 00:12:24.068
Are you just going to leave or are you going to confess?

226
00:12:24.068 --> 00:12:26.438
I... I was going to confess, but...

227
00:12:26.438 --> 00:12:27.608
Don't answer him!

228
00:12:27.608 --> 00:12:28.838
You don't have to answer me.

229
00:12:29.778 --> 00:12:31.409
Your attitude of answering questions here,

230
00:12:31.409 --> 00:12:33.249
fabricating the medical record and CCTV footage...

231
00:12:33.608 --> 00:12:35.918
have made this case even bigger.

232
00:12:38.688 --> 00:12:40.389
I think it's enough to prosecute him.

233
00:12:40.688 --> 00:12:43.918
Your attitude during the investigation will determine...

234
00:12:44.318 --> 00:12:46.729
whether you'll be sentenced and by how much.

235
00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:50.028
Are you threatening him?

236
00:12:50.028 --> 00:12:51.298
I'm simply giving an advice.

237
00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:54.499
I'm giving him a choice to either jump off a broken car...

238
00:12:54.898 --> 00:12:57.039
or kill himself in it.

239
00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.608
I insisted to admit my crime,

240
00:12:58.608 --> 00:13:00.238
but my lawyer said otherwise.

241
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:03.039
The consent form and the medical report are all fabricated by him.

242
00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:04.238
I don't even know what they are.

243
00:13:04.238 --> 00:13:05.249
Mr. Park!

244
00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:07.179
Lawyer Lee!

245
00:13:07.479 --> 00:13:10.249
I'll limit your participation if you keep interfering.

246
00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:11.688
That applies the same if you try to...

247
00:13:11.688 --> 00:13:13.648
destroy, fabricate, or hide evidence.

248
00:13:14.249 --> 00:13:16.059
Prosecutor Jung, please forgive me.

249
00:13:16.219 --> 00:13:19.188
If I ever hit my wife again, I'll eat my hat.

250
00:13:19.358 --> 00:13:21.258
Please have mercy on me.

251
00:13:21.398 --> 00:13:23.528
Let's see what kind of crimes you've committed.

252
00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:25.298
Then I'll consider your punishment.

253
00:13:25.568 --> 00:13:27.969
Prosecutor Jung, take a seat here.

254
00:13:28.499 --> 00:13:30.938
Let's begin, shall we?

255
00:13:36.962 --> 00:13:40.194
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E08 While You Were Sleeping "A Few Good Men"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

256
00:13:47.488 --> 00:13:48.988
Thank you, Prosecutor Jung.

257
00:13:51.258 --> 00:13:52.289
My goodness.

258
00:13:57.258 --> 00:13:58.269
Yes!

259
00:14:00.668 --> 00:14:01.668
We did it.

260
00:14:03.499 --> 00:14:04.499
Hey!

261
00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:06.708
- It was solved. - It was?

262
00:14:06.708 --> 00:14:07.708
Yes!

263
00:14:12.608 --> 00:14:14.449
The weather is so nice.

264
00:14:16.418 --> 00:14:19.918
Gosh, Lawyer Lee. You are one lucky man.

265
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:21.918
Have a cup of coffee.

266
00:14:22.818 --> 00:14:25.289
Wouldn't you be lacking one if I drink this?

267
00:14:25.358 --> 00:14:27.088
I don't have to give Prosecutor Jung then.

268
00:14:28.628 --> 00:14:32.568
Mr. Choi, I felt a little disappointed today.

269
00:14:32.999 --> 00:14:35.599
You should have told me if you had so much evidence.

270
00:14:37.398 --> 00:14:40.639
I also had no idea that Prosecutor Jung prepared so much.

271
00:14:40.738 --> 00:14:42.139
He pretends to be dumb.

272
00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:44.849
I thought you'd be on my side forever.

273
00:14:45.548 --> 00:14:46.579
You've changed.

274
00:14:48.449 --> 00:14:50.979
I don't take anyone's side in this field.

275
00:14:51.048 --> 00:14:54.249
I had none when I worked with you and even now too.

276
00:14:55.289 --> 00:14:57.988
But if you feel like I've changed,

277
00:14:58.688 --> 00:15:01.599
doesn't that mean you're the one who's changed?

278
00:15:13.668 --> 00:15:15.079
Oh, good work today.

279
00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:17.008
You were pretty cool today.

280
00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:20.809
- Mr. Choi. - Yes.

281
00:15:20.979 --> 00:15:23.548
I've had wrong ideas about you all this time.

282
00:15:23.849 --> 00:15:25.588
- Sorry? - I thought you were treating...

283
00:15:25.588 --> 00:15:28.318
Lawyer Lee specially because he used to be a prosecutor.

284
00:15:28.858 --> 00:15:31.219
I even doubted if you've taken bribes from him.

285
00:15:33.528 --> 00:15:35.729
I wondered if you drank with him when you left work early.

286
00:15:35.758 --> 00:15:38.798
I wondered if you drank too much when you came in late to work.

287
00:15:39.369 --> 00:15:41.838
Come on, I didn't go home that early.

288
00:15:41.838 --> 00:15:44.099
I was late only once too.

289
00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:45.869
You text so much during office hours...

290
00:15:46.168 --> 00:15:47.738
that I thought you were close to him.

291
00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:51.878
The texts were from the banks, telling me to pay back the loan.

292
00:15:52.349 --> 00:15:54.949
I'm sorry for thinking like that about you.

293
00:16:00.988 --> 00:16:02.258
But...

294
00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:09.898
Try to text less when you're working, will you?

295
00:16:10.858 --> 00:16:12.568
Sir, that's not...

296
00:16:12.568 --> 00:16:13.628
Mr. Choi, you've changed.

297
00:16:14.369 --> 00:16:16.298
You always used your time wisely.

298
00:16:16.298 --> 00:16:18.238
That's not true, Prosecutor Lee.

299
00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:20.639
I heard your liver's not well.

300
00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:22.139
Stop drinking already!

301
00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:28.119
They are all misunderstandings!

302
00:16:28.449 --> 00:16:30.949
All those things he said are false!

303
00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:37.188
Prosecutor Jung.

304
00:16:40.059 --> 00:16:41.229
Can we talk?

305
00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:48.298
What's this?

306
00:16:48.298 --> 00:16:51.168
He used to work with me at another division.

307
00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:52.539
His nickname is Viper.

308
00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:55.809
Recently, he opened his own lawyer's office after quitting as a prosecutor.

309
00:16:56.778 --> 00:16:59.849
Viper will be the only one who can take care of Park Jun Mo...

310
00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:02.749
who hides his properties well. Viper has a high winning rate.

311
00:17:02.778 --> 00:17:05.119
Give Ms. Do a call. It'll be helpful.

312
00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:06.918
Gosh, I haven't thought of this.

313
00:17:08.818 --> 00:17:12.188
Of course you haven't. You were too focused to catch Park Jun Mo.

314
00:17:12.528 --> 00:17:14.429
Thank you. I can tell you have more experience.

315
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:17.458
Of course. That's how you do it.

316
00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.898
I can leave such good impression.

317
00:17:24.438 --> 00:17:26.168
Did... Did you see me do that?

318
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:30.608
Yes, over here with everyone else.

319
00:17:37.378 --> 00:17:40.449
Everyone, raise your glass.

320
00:17:40.449 --> 00:17:42.958
Everyone, it's such a good day.

321
00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.688
Repeat after me. Enjoy!

322
00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:45.929
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

323
00:17:48.858 --> 00:17:50.298
Are you drinking alcohol?

324
00:17:50.298 --> 00:17:52.128
Prosecutor Jung...

325
00:17:52.668 --> 00:17:54.738
is very smart with his work.

326
00:17:54.898 --> 00:17:59.269
He's also looking after the costs in moving and tuitions.

327
00:17:59.438 --> 00:18:03.039
He also ordered my husband to stay away from us.

328
00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:05.278
Do you still think my brother is just another stupid prosecutor?

329
00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:11.318
I guess not. Look, he's here.

330
00:18:12.148 --> 00:18:13.349
I'll bring him in.

331
00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:18.988
Don't you think those two come too often?

332
00:18:19.159 --> 00:18:21.599
It's because the food here is good.

333
00:18:21.599 --> 00:18:22.628
Let's go in.

334
00:18:22.628 --> 00:18:25.429
I don't know. I think there's another reason.

335
00:18:25.469 --> 00:18:27.199
Another reason? What?

336
00:18:27.298 --> 00:18:28.568
- I was just passing... - Come on.

337
00:18:28.568 --> 00:18:30.469
- Even so... - Just have a bowl of rice.

338
00:18:30.469 --> 00:18:32.238
I heard you prosecuted Park Jun Mo.

339
00:18:32.769 --> 00:18:34.338
Good job!

340
00:18:34.338 --> 00:18:35.479
That's nothing.

341
00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:37.409
Isn't that your job?

342
00:18:37.438 --> 00:18:39.079
Really? You did?

343
00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:41.008
That's amazing! I didn't know that.

344
00:18:41.249 --> 00:18:44.119
Come here. I'll give you a hug.

345
00:18:45.048 --> 00:18:46.648
Come on. Come here.

346
00:18:47.688 --> 00:18:49.188
Come on.

347
00:18:52.729 --> 00:18:54.488
Darn it. What's taking him so long?

348
00:18:55.729 --> 00:18:56.758
Is he having a team dinner?

349
00:18:57.798 --> 00:18:58.829
Or is he working late?

350
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:24.929
Who are you?

351
00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:27.559
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:31.668 --> 00:19:32.869
It's hot. Be careful.

353
00:19:34.398 --> 00:19:37.869
Do you remember this tall guy with long arms?

354
00:19:38.369 --> 00:19:39.668
Did he come?

355
00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:42.278
No, he didn't come today.

356
00:19:44.949 --> 00:19:45.949
I see.

357
00:19:46.949 --> 00:19:48.219
Welcome.

358
00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:51.219
I'd like an Americano with double shots and hazelnut syrup.

359
00:19:53.889 --> 00:19:56.119
Do you remember this girl that comes every morning?

360
00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:59.429
- You know, with short hair... - Oh, she...

361
00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:01.628
was just here looking for you.

362
00:20:02.398 --> 00:20:04.258
Don't you guys know each other's number?

363
00:20:06.199 --> 00:20:07.229
No, not yet.

364
00:20:10.798 --> 00:20:12.639
Gosh, that woman.

365
00:20:12.738 --> 00:20:14.039
I can't see her when I need her.

366
00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:29.188
Gosh.

367
00:20:36.599 --> 00:20:37.898
What are you looking for?

368
00:20:57.418 --> 00:20:58.619
Give me your number.

369
00:20:59.789 --> 00:21:01.918
It was killing me that I couldn't reach you.

370
00:21:02.719 --> 00:21:03.758
What's this?

371
00:21:04.088 --> 00:21:05.088
It's my business card.

372
00:21:05.358 --> 00:21:07.389
I'm taking a break from work, but the number is the same.

373
00:21:07.389 --> 00:21:08.429
Call me with that number.

374
00:21:10.659 --> 00:21:13.269
Have you heard what happened with the Park Jun Mo case?

375
00:21:13.568 --> 00:21:14.599
Yes.

376
00:21:14.668 --> 00:21:18.338
I heard you prosecuted him even with charges from the past cases.

377
00:21:21.139 --> 00:21:23.608
I'm so relieved that my dream was wrong.

378
00:21:23.938 --> 00:21:25.849
Why didn't you tell me about it in the morning?

379
00:21:26.148 --> 00:21:28.979
I just wanted to support you.

380
00:21:30.619 --> 00:21:32.318
I refuse your support.

381
00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:35.519
By the way, why did you look for me?

382
00:21:35.958 --> 00:21:37.858
Were you going to show off?

383
00:21:38.329 --> 00:21:41.159
I wasn't looking for you. I came here straight from the office.

384
00:21:43.258 --> 00:21:44.599
Then what's with that apron?

385
00:21:44.869 --> 00:21:46.329
It looks like you went to my store.

386
00:21:47.668 --> 00:21:50.139
Is it your fashion item? Or is it to warm yourself?

387
00:21:51.568 --> 00:21:52.639
Darn it.

388
00:21:54.369 --> 00:21:57.608
You told me that my support is like a threat to you...

389
00:21:58.349 --> 00:22:00.148
because I might get disappointed if you fail, right?

390
00:22:00.378 --> 00:22:02.079
That's right. I don't like it.

391
00:22:04.719 --> 00:22:06.088
Hold on. Let me get it for you.

392
00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:10.488
I won't get disappointed.

393
00:22:11.358 --> 00:22:13.559
If you do well, I'd be grateful.

394
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.059
If you fail, I'd be grateful that you tried.

395
00:22:16.458 --> 00:22:17.729
Why would I get disappointed?

396
00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:27.639
So don't reject my support.

397
00:22:31.878 --> 00:22:32.878
You can do it.

398
00:22:44.659 --> 00:22:45.659
Thank you.

399
00:23:38.378 --> 00:23:39.648
What are you doing?

400
00:23:45.688 --> 00:23:47.519
I'm undoing your apron.

401
00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:51.289
Gosh, I must be crazy. Why did I have to close my eyes?

402
00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:21.958
Why is he here?

403
00:24:22.619 --> 00:24:24.088
I invited him. Is there a problem?

404
00:24:24.119 --> 00:24:25.188
You did well.

405
00:24:26.188 --> 00:24:28.128
You have big breakfasts every day?

406
00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:30.999
Yes, we had five-spice sliced pork for yesterday's breakfast.

407
00:24:31.469 --> 00:24:33.699
By the way, what's going on with So Yoon studying overseas?

408
00:24:33.699 --> 00:24:37.068
We got a call from Evan Foundation that it's confirmed.

409
00:24:37.238 --> 00:24:39.508
They will support for the tuition.

410
00:24:40.139 --> 00:24:42.338
That's great. That's great news.

411
00:24:42.508 --> 00:24:45.048
Are you going to stay in a dorm when you go abroad?

412
00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:48.449
Yes, but don't worry.

413
00:24:48.579 --> 00:24:51.588
The wireless internet will work well there, so I can text you every day.

414
00:24:51.619 --> 00:24:52.619
Every day?

415
00:24:53.048 --> 00:24:55.659
- You don't like it? - I do.

416
00:24:57.188 --> 00:25:01.028
Have you checked the dorm's water pressure?

417
00:25:01.188 --> 00:25:03.758
For yours, they'd need very strong water pressure.

418
00:25:04.258 --> 00:25:06.199
What's she saying? What about water pressure?

419
00:25:06.199 --> 00:25:07.798
Be quiet, won't you?

420
00:25:07.798 --> 00:25:11.369
If the toilet gets clogged like last time, you might need to come back.

421
00:25:11.369 --> 00:25:13.168
I said be quiet.

422
00:25:13.738 --> 00:25:16.079
That was mine.

423
00:25:20.449 --> 00:25:22.019
- What? - Really?

424
00:25:22.479 --> 00:25:24.179
Why are you saying that now?

425
00:25:24.179 --> 00:25:26.318
I was too occupied then.

426
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:28.119
What do you mean?

427
00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:30.559
You should have just openly said it.

428
00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:32.758
I just told you now.

429
00:25:33.258 --> 00:25:34.898
How disappointing.

430
00:25:35.028 --> 00:25:36.699
How's that disappointing?

431
00:25:39.168 --> 00:25:40.369
It's really good.

432
00:25:40.798 --> 00:25:43.369
I haven't had a proper breakfast for a long time.

433
00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:45.809
Why didn't you bring your brother along?

434
00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:47.838
Jae Chan said he has to go somewhere.

435
00:25:48.008 --> 00:25:49.008
Where?

(Late Jung Il Song)

437
00:26:15.798 --> 00:26:16.869
How about a prosecutor?

438
00:26:17.099 --> 00:26:20.208
It's my wish that you become a prosecutor.

439
00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:22.708
I can be one if you want.

440
00:26:22.838 --> 00:26:23.838
You can do it.

441
00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:29.548
Dad.

442
00:26:30.749 --> 00:26:33.219
I became a prosecutor just like you told me.

443
00:26:34.488 --> 00:26:36.519
I was afraid of disappointing you,

444
00:26:36.958 --> 00:26:38.358
so I tried really hard.

445
00:26:39.258 --> 00:26:42.059
Sometimes, I wanted to run away because it was too tough.

446
00:26:49.099 --> 00:26:52.208
That's how much...

447
00:26:53.369 --> 00:26:54.469
I must have loved you.

448
00:26:59.979 --> 00:27:01.519
(Nam Hong Joo)

449
00:27:02.318 --> 00:27:05.688
Now I have someone who wishes the best of me.

450
00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:45.958
I won't get disappointed.

451
00:27:46.429 --> 00:27:48.659
If you do well, I'd be grateful.

452
00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:50.659
If you fail, I'd be grateful that you tried.

453
00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:52.369
Why would I get disappointed?

454
00:27:53.999 --> 00:27:55.238
Whether I do well or not,

455
00:27:55.738 --> 00:27:57.398
she'd tell me that it's okay.

456
00:27:58.338 --> 00:28:01.479
So don't reject my support.

457
00:28:05.548 --> 00:28:06.548
You can do it.

458
00:28:09.749 --> 00:28:10.818
But...

459
00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:13.818
I want to do well.

460
00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:17.559
Thank you.

461
00:28:19.858 --> 00:28:20.858
Thank you.

462
00:28:25.869 --> 00:28:26.898
Now I'm scared...

463
00:28:27.798 --> 00:28:28.938
of that thought.

464
00:29:33.528 --> 00:29:34.568
Jae Chan.

465
00:29:42.278 --> 00:29:43.479
You must have had a dream.

466
00:29:44.179 --> 00:29:45.249
What did you dream about?

467
00:29:45.648 --> 00:29:47.208
Did you dream about something that's going to happen later?

468
00:29:48.918 --> 00:29:50.918
Before that thought tires me out...

469
00:29:52.988 --> 00:29:54.659
and before that thought gets bigger,

470
00:29:57.519 --> 00:29:58.729
I want to run away.
