00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:41.001
the tree was rotting.

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:43.667

Executive Producer Jeong Tae-sung

7
00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:47.167
it's far from it.

Financing Executives Michelle Kwon Simon Lee

10
00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:53.917
In the dream,

11
00:00:54.917 --> 00:01:02.209
I saw the tree grow strong
towards the blue sky.

12
00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:09.001
I gathered everyone
and said the tree wasn't rotting.

13
00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:16.001
It was not a rotting tree.

Hey, Mr. Hairy,

00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:31.959
if you tail Cap, he'll be exposed.

31
00:02:51.876 --> 00:02:54.126
Captain, I got the building scan.

32
00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:55.792
Look at those hostiles.

33
00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:57.876
How do we disarm the bomb inside?

34
00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:01.209
I'll take point, rest of you take the rear.

35
00:03:01.376 --> 00:03:03.626
Say what? You'll take point?

36
00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:05.501
Captain! Captain!

37
00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.376

- Fall back!
- Sitrep!

41
00:04:22.292 --> 00:04:23.876
Cap, it's a trap!

42
00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:27.251
- Can you hold position?
- Not looking good.

43
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:28.751
Cap, can you disarm the bomb?

44
00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:30.626
Leave it to me.

45
00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:55.542
Almost there, just a bit longer.

46
00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:58.167
Mr. Hairy!

47
00:04:58.167 --> 00:04:59.417
I don't believe this!

00:04:59.584 --> 00:05:00.876
I'm going in, give me cover!

49
00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:01.626
Hold position!

50
00:05:01.626 --> 00:05:03.292
Don't move! Stay there!

51
00:05:05.334 --> 00:05:08.542
Cap, I sent the bomb blueprint, get to it ASAP!

00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:09.751
Captain!

53

If you don't hurry, we'll be in danger! Go!

54
00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:19.917
Cap! Hairy's a lost cause, leave him this time!

55
00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:41.417
Pull Mr. Hairy out!

56
00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:44.126
Yong_Guru, demolition, go disarm the bomb!

He's crazy.

60
00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:50.459
That's why he's our leader.

Cap, we're here!

62
00:05:57.126 --> 00:05:58.417
Okay, on the double.

"Round Won"

70
00:07:14.876 --> 00:07:16.667
We won without you.

71
00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:18.626
It's all Mr. Hairy's fault.

72
00:07:18.626 --> 00:07:20.626
Shouldn't he stick to another game?

73
00:07:20.626 --> 00:07:22.834
- Sorry.
- So long as we won.

74
00:07:23.292 --> 00:07:26.417
Cap, you're so dope.

75
00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:30.417
He knows he's the shit,
he calls himself 'Captain.'

76
00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:32.542
Who cares about that,
I'm always getting killed.

77
00:07:32.542 --> 00:07:35.542
Because you're always trying to save others.

78
00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:37.334
You're the one to talk, Hairy.

79
00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:40.376
Alright, since we won big,
let's meet up for dinner.

Cap, please come tonight!

82
00:07:44.084 --> 00:07:46.126
Being mysterious is overrated.

83
00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:48.834
Let's get a look at you for once.

84
00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.376
How's BBQ intestines?

85
00:07:50.376 --> 00:07:52.334
Deal! BBQ with Captain!

86
00:07:52.334 --> 00:07:55.042
I'm really busy nowadays...

87
00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.292

"Madam Lee"
No, I wanna see you.

89
00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:01.001
What do you exactly do?

90
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:02.959
I'm getting nonstop work calls.

91
00:08:03.542 --> 00:08:05.126
- I'm logging off.
- What? No!

92
00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:07.042
What?

93
00:08:07.042 --> 00:08:09.751
Where are you? PC café again?

94
00:08:09.751 --> 00:08:10.542
No nagging-

95
00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:13.501
Are you a kid? Always playing games?

96
00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:15.626
Why are you calling me'?

97
00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:17.417
I left the stove gas valve on.

98
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:18.792
Go lock it.

99
00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:21.542
You called me for that? Gas valve?

100
00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:23.709
It could blow up, go right now.

101
00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:25.501
Why would it blow up?!

102
00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:26.751
I'm busy.

103
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:28.751
So proud of you, you freeloader.

104

Come on!

105
00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:34.084
I got overnight shift at the hospital.

106
00:08:34.084 --> 00:08:35.751
Go when I say nicely.

107
00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:36.917
I'm really busy!

108
00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:39.459
- See you tomorrow.
- Mom! Mom!

109
00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:44.834
Pretty, isn't it?

110
00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:49.209
My son bought it While on a school trip.

111
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:51.209
It's germanium.

112
00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:54.417
It's good for health, apparently.

Is this PC cafe'?

116
00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:19.751
I left my phone there.

117
00:09:19.751 --> 00:09:21.417
Could you bring it to me?

118
00:09:21.584 --> 00:09:23.126
- Right now I'm at...
- Wait a minute.

119
00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:24.751
I'm a really busy man.

120
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:26.751
I'll pay you $300.

121
00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:30.501
I don't believe this.

122
00:09:34.209 --> 00:09:36.251
Where are you?

123
00:09:55.834 --> 00:09:57.084
Hello?

124
00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:01.334
Anyone home?

125
00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:07.667
What the hell?

126
00:10:15.084 --> 00:10:16.042
Excuse me?

127
00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:19.876
I brought your phone back.

128
00:10:20.126 --> 00:10:23.334
Hi, I'm in the shower.

129
00:10:23.542 --> 00:10:25.667
You can leave it anywhere.

130
00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:28.376
You said you'd pay me...

131
00:10:28.376 --> 00:10:30.751
It's on my bed upstairs.

132
00:10:33.167 --> 00:10:34.292
Okay.

133
00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:43.292
I left your phone on your bed.

134
00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:54.626
You should lock your door,
it could be dangerous.

135
00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:24.084
Get him! Grab him!

136
00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:29.209
Hold still, asshole!

137
00:11:30.042 --> 00:11:31.834
Be cool, don't resist!

138
00:11:31.834 --> 00:11:35.959
You're under arrest
for statutory rape and murder.

You may plea the Fifth...

What's going on?

141
00:11:44.084 --> 00:11:46.126
- Call the forensics.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:50.876
I said don't move!

143
00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:56.292
Reveal his face!

...was arrested this morning.

148
00:12:09.001 --> 00:12:11.626
The signature on this check, is this yours?

149
00:12:12.292 --> 00:12:13.292
That's right.

150
00:12:13.292 --> 00:12:14.459
Yes, but the thing is...

151
00:12:15.042 --> 00:12:17.709
What about your fingerprints
all over this knife?

152
00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:19.251
That's what I don't get...

153
00:12:19.251 --> 00:12:22.417
Prime suspect Kwon
was a national taekwondo athlete,

"Kwon played Violent Game prior to Killing"
but was dismissed after an assault case,

155
00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:28.334
and led a life of unemployment
and resorted to video games.

156
00:12:28.334 --> 00:12:29.917
He was a national athlete?

157
00:12:30.167 --> 00:12:30.792
What's with you?

158
00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:31.876
Where's my son?

159
00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:34.251
- You can't come here!
- Let go! Where's my son!

00:12:34.251 --> 00:12:35.417
Kwon Yu!

161
00:12:35.876 --> 00:12:38.417
The suspect is denying all charges,

162
00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:39.834
while fingerprints and DNA

"DNA Analysis Report"

167

your sperm was detected.

168
00:12:52.501 --> 00:12:53.834
My son is not a killer.

169
00:12:53.876 --> 00:12:58.501
Please read this.

170
00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:00.459
My son was framed.

171
00:13:00.834 --> 00:13:02.751
Please read this, thank you.

172
00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:07.626
You have no conscience, he's a monster.

173
00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:16.001
The DNA found at the scene are
that of suspect Kwon Yu,

174
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:19.209
and the court is
pressured to hand out a shift justice.

175
00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:21.001
Attorney Min,

176
00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:24.084
my boy would never kill a person.

177
00:13:24.084 --> 00:13:25.251
Please look at this.

178
00:13:25.251 --> 00:13:26.584
You can leave the documents there.

179
00:13:26.584 --> 00:13:28.042
Please take a look.

180
00:13:28.042 --> 00:13:29.876
He won an award.

181
00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:31.792
Sir, since he was a child...

182
00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:33.959
Hello, attorney-at-law Min Chum-sang.

183
00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:38.792
Yes, I'm a public defender,
what can I do for you?

184
00:13:43.084 --> 00:13:45.251
Don't worry too much.

185
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:47.917
Send us the documents, and we'll review them.

186
00:13:48.209 --> 00:13:49.376
Yes.

187
00:13:49.917 --> 00:13:51.501
Thank you.

188
00:13:52.792 --> 00:13:57.542
I raised him even more strictly
because he didn't have a father.

189
00:13:57.542 --> 00:13:59.251
From the way I look at it,

190
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:01.501
you should...

191
00:14:02.084 --> 00:14:04.334
ask your son to confess and admit it.

192
00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:06.209
At least he'll get extenuation.

193
00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:08.501
But Mr. Min, you didn't even listen...

194
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:11.376
The evidence against him are massive,

195
00:14:11.376 --> 00:14:13.959
so if he continues to deny,
it could get worse...

196
00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:15.084
Ma'am? Ma'am?

197
00:14:15.209 --> 00:14:16.501
Could we talk?

198
00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:19.209
Did the police tell you to come here?

199
00:14:19.209 --> 00:14:23.126
Mr. Min is all about helping those in need.

200
00:14:23.126 --> 00:14:25.876
- If you go home and wait...
- Mr. Min!

201
00:14:26.542 --> 00:14:29.126
Please believe my boy.

202
00:14:30.376 --> 00:14:34.667
The defendant quickly left the crime scene
after the murder...

203
00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:36.376
Only collected the reward...

204
00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:42.251
The prints on the knife
and the door knob match Kwon's.

205
00:14:44.084 --> 00:14:47.709
After sexually assaulting a minor twice,

206
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:51.876
Kwon stabbed her 31 times
in the neck and abdomen,

207
00:14:51.876 --> 00:14:55.376
and moved the body to the washroom
to wipe it down.

208
00:14:55.376 --> 00:14:56.417
Please be quiet!

209
00:14:56.417 --> 00:14:57.751
I really didn't do it.

210
00:14:57.751 --> 00:15:02.959
When a game addict indulges,
he can't tell reality from fantasy.

211
00:15:03.126 --> 00:15:08.626
That's why he'd commit antisocial
acts without remorse.

212
00:15:08.626 --> 00:15:11.417
Capital punishment or castration!

213
00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:12.626
Just castrate him!

214
00:15:12.626 --> 00:15:16.251
"Councilor proposes 'Kwon Yu Bill"'
Councilor Park introduced a bill

215
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:19.042
for harsher rape punishment.

216
00:15:19.042 --> 00:15:21.251
After his dismissal from the national team,

217
00:15:21.251 --> 00:15:25.709
please understand that
he suffered from heavy depression.

218
00:15:26.501 --> 00:15:31.917
Despite clear evidence against him,

219
00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:36.834
defendant Kwon Yu refuses
to admit any wrongdoings.

220
00:15:36.834 --> 00:15:38.584
As such,

221
00:15:39.126 --> 00:15:44.709
the defendant is
guilty of sexual assault of a minor,

222
00:15:44.709 --> 00:15:50.542
first degree murder of a minor,
and desecrating a human corpse,

223
00:15:50.542 --> 00:15:52.501
and he is sentenced as follows.

224
00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:56.751
Life imprisonment without parole.

225
00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:01.459
It wasn't my boy!

226
00:16:02.167 --> 00:16:03.542
No way! No!

227
00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:04.417
He didn't do it! No!

228
00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:06.542
It wasn't me! I don't know anything!

229
00:16:06.542 --> 00:16:07.751
Kwon Yu!

230
00:16:08.251 --> 00:16:09.834
It wasn't me! Mom!

231
00:16:10.084 --> 00:16:11.251
Mom! Mom!

232
00:16:11.251 --> 00:16:13.126
The defendant's identity

233
00:16:13.126 --> 00:16:17.834
will be made visible
to the public for 10 years.

234
00:16:18.792 --> 00:16:22.084
As part of rehabilitation,

235
00:16:22.084 --> 00:16:25.959
he'll undergo 5-year sexual impulse treatment.

236
00:16:26.584 --> 00:16:30.542
In addition,
due to violent nature of his crime,

237
00:16:30.876 --> 00:16:34.126
and as he requires isolation from the society,

238
00:16:34.334 --> 00:16:38.876
he will serve his sentence
in maximum security prison.

239
00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:44.959
- Wait! Please!
- Come out!

240
00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:47.459
Come out, asshole!

241
00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:50.209
Wait! It wasn't me!

242
00:18:22.584 --> 00:18:23.876
Come here!

243
00:18:23.876 --> 00:18:25.459
Out Of my way!

244
00:18:50.542 --> 00:18:51.834
You came in for this, right?

245
00:18:52.709 --> 00:18:53.751
Rape.

246
00:18:54.792 --> 00:18:56.459
Raping a kiddie. You bastard.

247
00:18:56.459 --> 00:18:58.001
It wasn't me.

248
00:18:58.126 --> 00:18:59.167
Asshole!

249
00:19:00.459 --> 00:19:02.501
How dare you talk back!

250
00:19:03.209 --> 00:19:04.292
Son of a bitch!

251
00:19:07.751 --> 00:19:10.251
Look around, look at them.

252
00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:14.542
They're all proud of their crimes.
"I committed murder!"

253
00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:16.209
"I beat him until he stopped breathing!"

254
00:19:16.209 --> 00:19:18.209
"I feel bad for not killing him!"

255
00:19:18.209 --> 00:19:19.667
Look at this chump.

256
00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:21.376
You're denying everything.

257
00:19:21.542 --> 00:19:23.667
"It wasn't me, I didn't do it!"

258
00:19:25.001 --> 00:19:26.334
"You're all wrong! it was consensual!"

259
00:19:26.334 --> 00:19:27.459
"it was love! We loved each other!"

260
00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:29.209
Fuck!

261
00:19:30.626 --> 00:19:32.417
Come at me, asshole!

262
00:19:34.334 --> 00:19:36.126
Boss! Boss!

263
00:19:37.084 --> 00:19:38.667
Let go!!

264
00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:39.834
Son of a bitch!

265
00:19:40.792 --> 00:19:42.584
Move aside!

266
00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:49.792
Stay back!

267
00:19:49.792 --> 00:19:52.209
Are you fucking nuts?!

268
00:19:52.834 --> 00:19:56.001
When an adult talks, just say,
"Yes, I understand, sir!"

269
00:19:56.001 --> 00:19:59.501
That's common courtesy.
Don't hit the ground!

270
00:19:59.501 --> 00:20:02.126
How dare you sucker punch me?!

271
00:20:02.126 --> 00:20:03.292
My hand!

272
00:20:04.084 --> 00:20:05.459
You're dead meat.

273
00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:07.042
Goddammit!

274
00:20:07.209 --> 00:20:08.417
Stand back!

275
00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:09.542
Ma Duk-su.

276
00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.626
I got hit, I'm the victim.

277
00:20:11.626 --> 00:20:12.876
He hit me first.

278
00:20:12.876 --> 00:20:14.376
They're all witnesses.

279
00:20:14.626 --> 00:20:16.209
Look, bloody nose.

280
00:20:20.876 --> 00:20:21.959
Take him away.

281
00:20:32.167 --> 00:20:34.792
Kwon Yu, 30 days in isolation.

282
00:21:01.209 --> 00:21:03.042
I heard you sucker punched Ma.

283
00:21:04.542 --> 00:21:05.834
It's okay, it's okay.

284
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:09.209
We don't play with them, we're on your side.

285
00:21:09.209 --> 00:21:12.584
For someone who got life,
how could you assault him?

286
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:15.251
You need to be on his good side.

287
00:21:15.751 --> 00:21:16.792
Like me.

288
00:21:16.792 --> 00:21:18.876
And him, watch out for him.

289
00:21:19.376 --> 00:21:20.626
He's a serial killer.

290
00:21:20.626 --> 00:21:23.334
He ate the person he killed.

291
00:21:23.334 --> 00:21:26.042
Watch out for him and Ma Duk-su.

292
00:21:26.042 --> 00:21:29.626
Anyway, let's get some details.

293
00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:34.542
How old was she?

294
00:21:35.584 --> 00:21:36.959
Middle school?

295
00:21:37.084 --> 00:21:38.292
High school?

296
00:21:39.292 --> 00:21:42.001
School uniform or plain clothes? Tell us!

297
00:21:42.001 --> 00:21:44.292
We have to stick together,
you could die on your own!

298
00:21:57.251 --> 00:21:58.251
You bastard!

299
00:21:59.917 --> 00:22:01.042
Get him!

300
00:22:10.667 --> 00:22:12.292
I really hate

301
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:16.792
those who don't repent.

302
00:22:17.167 --> 00:22:21.167
If you committed a crime,
you must repent and start anew.

303
00:22:21.459 --> 00:22:23.959
Already starting a fight, misbehaving and shit.

304
00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:31.251
After today, I want to see you
repenting and remorseful.

305
00:22:35.917 --> 00:22:37.001
Please don't kill us.

306
00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:38.167
Come on, get ready.

307
00:22:44.292 --> 00:22:45.376
Do it.

308
00:22:45.751 --> 00:22:47.084
What you did to the kiddie.

309
00:22:47.084 --> 00:22:48.542
Shit, are you nuts?

310
00:22:49.876 --> 00:22:52.667
How about you? Can you do him?

311
00:22:52.959 --> 00:22:55.334
What? Yes! Yes!

312
00:22:55.334 --> 00:22:57.876
I'll do it, I'll do my best!

313
00:22:58.584 --> 00:22:59.417
Go on.

314
00:22:59.417 --> 00:23:02.459
Let me go, you fucking quacks!

315
00:23:08.334 --> 00:23:12.626
"My son is not a killer!"

316
00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:15.626
You bitch!

317
00:23:17.042 --> 00:23:18.417
Grab him!

318
00:23:19.292 --> 00:23:23.459
- Hold still, you shit!
- Don't move!

319
00:24:02.501 --> 00:24:04.251
It's tough in there, right?

320
00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:09.417
I went on...

321
00:24:10.709 --> 00:24:13.167
a 'l-person protest in front of the court,

322
00:24:14.376 --> 00:24:17.376
and had an interview with a news magazine,

323
00:24:18.251 --> 00:24:21.126
and thanks to that

324
00:24:22.459 --> 00:24:26.292
I got in touch with someone
who knows your alibi.

325
00:24:27.542 --> 00:24:32.417
I'll meet him next week
and start the appeal process.

326
00:24:36.167 --> 00:24:37.042
Honey.

327
00:24:50.001 --> 00:24:51.001
L...

328
00:24:53.292 --> 00:24:55.834
don't want to be a rapist's mom.

329
00:24:57.584 --> 00:24:59.792
If you don't want to be a rapist,

330
00:25:00.876 --> 00:25:03.001
stay strong and endure.

331
00:25:06.126 --> 00:25:12.917
I'm going to get you out of here.

332
00:25:33.167 --> 00:25:34.626
Look at him.

333
00:25:35.209 --> 00:25:37.167
He's got that drive to live.

334
00:25:37.834 --> 00:25:38.917
Then I better help.

335
00:26:19.292 --> 00:26:21.501
Rub that on your wounds.

336
00:26:24.792 --> 00:26:27.542
You must've been an athlete.

337
00:26:27.542 --> 00:26:30.834
You protected pressure points
even during beatings.

338
00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:53.792
I've been watching you.

339
00:26:53.792 --> 00:26:55.917
You're not a killer type.

340
00:26:59.792 --> 00:27:03.459
I'm sure Ma knows you're not a rapist-murderer.

341
00:27:08.042 --> 00:27:11.209
You simply messed with his self-esteem.

342
00:29:05.001 --> 00:29:06.376
Ma's down cold!

343
00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:14.001
Kwon Yu, you got a visitor.

344
00:29:29.292 --> 00:29:30.459
Did you come alone?

345
00:29:31.959 --> 00:29:32.792
What about mom?

346
00:29:41.292 --> 00:29:43.251
"Death Certificate: Lee Yeon-ok"

347
00:29:44.417 --> 00:29:45.959
What's this?

348
00:29:52.959 --> 00:29:55.501
She's had some hard time,

349
00:29:57.251 --> 00:29:59.542
but I didn't think she'd go this far...

350
00:29:59.542 --> 00:30:02.167
What are you saying?

351
00:30:02.334 --> 00:30:03.959
Why would she?

352
00:30:04.084 --> 00:30:05.876
She said she'd get me out,

353
00:30:06.626 --> 00:30:08.376
and told me to stay strong...

354
00:30:10.209 --> 00:30:13.209
Why'd she do this all of a sudden?

355
00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:16.376
To have a funeral, you must sign it.

356
00:30:18.251 --> 00:30:23.501
The district office will
take care of the funeral.

357
00:30:24.417 --> 00:30:29.584
But you won't be able to attend it.

358
00:30:31.167 --> 00:30:35.334
I tried to get you to attend,
but the motion was denied.

359
00:31:46.417 --> 00:31:47.626
Mom!

360
00:31:50.667 --> 00:31:51.834
Mom...

361
00:32:04.667 --> 00:32:06.417
Mom!

362
00:32:07.501 --> 00:32:09.709
Mom!

363
00:32:55.667 --> 00:32:57.084
Don't resist!

364
00:33:32.167 --> 00:33:34.001
Kwon Yu! Drop the shiv!

365
00:34:07.334 --> 00:34:12.792
If artery, muscle or organs are damaged,
you're fucked.

366
00:34:12.792 --> 00:34:15.626
So don't stab too deep, go for waist, okay?

367
00:34:19.501 --> 00:34:21.042
Got a plan once outside?

368
00:34:23.334 --> 00:34:24.917
I'm gonna clear my name.

369
00:34:26.167 --> 00:34:28.417
I promised my mom that

370
00:34:29.001 --> 00:34:30.459
I would not be a rapist.

371
00:34:42.834 --> 00:34:43.834
Give me the key.

372
00:36:28.584 --> 00:36:32.167
Rapist-murderer Kwon Yu
escaped from prison yesterday.

373
00:36:32.167 --> 00:36:33.667
When the police reached the scene,

374
00:36:33.667 --> 00:36:36.584
Kwon Yu was nowhere to be found,

375
00:36:36.709 --> 00:36:41.001
and they sent out
nation-wide all-points bulletin.

376
00:36:41.001 --> 00:36:43.376
Kwon's current whereabouts are unknown,

377
00:36:43.376 --> 00:36:47.042
and his uniform
was recovered at a fishing site...

378
00:36:47.042 --> 00:36:52.126
The police found blood on his uniform,
and he is presumed to be injured,

379
00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:55.334
so he may not have gotten far.

380
00:36:55.334 --> 00:36:57.501
"Police issued nationwide APB"
They're fortifying

381
00:36:57.501 --> 00:36:59.542
checkpoints bus terminals,

382
00:36:59.542 --> 00:37:04.876
and searching nearby mountains
and put blockades on main roads.

383
00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:19.834
Hey! Hey! Help!

384
00:37:29.584 --> 00:37:31.542
You're quite handy!

385
00:37:31.626 --> 00:37:34.084
Amazing!

386
00:37:34.084 --> 00:37:36.917
We would've had to cancel the whole vacation
if it weren't for you.

387
00:37:36.917 --> 00:37:38.167
Our hero.

388
00:37:38.167 --> 00:37:41.501
We're going to Cheongju airport.
How do you say?

389
00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:46.334
- Cheongju airport.
- Right, Cheongju airport.

390
00:37:46.876 --> 00:37:50.042
We're going to Hangzhou, China.

391
00:37:50.042 --> 00:37:51.667
Yeah, in China. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:37:52.084 --> 00:37:54.376
Backpacking!

393
00:37:54.834 --> 00:37:56.126
So happy!

394
00:38:01.417 --> 00:38:02.542
What's this?

395
00:38:02.542 --> 00:38:03.917
Road block in place.

396
00:38:18.084 --> 00:38:19.001
This is a checkpoint...

397
00:38:19.001 --> 00:38:20.459
What's going on? I don't have all day.

398
00:38:20.459 --> 00:38:21.542
We have to go. We have to go

399
00:38:21.542 --> 00:38:23.042
Wait, wait, wait! I know, I know.

400
00:38:23.042 --> 00:38:24.459
Listen, we really gotta go.

401
00:38:24.459 --> 00:38:25.376
We really have a plane to catch.

402
00:38:25.376 --> 00:38:27.751
- How about you let me talk to the officer, okay?
- Fine, alright.

403
00:38:27.751 --> 00:38:29.292
- Pass!
- Okay, thank you.

404
00:38:29.292 --> 00:38:30.292
- Pass?
- Thank you, thank you

405
00:38:30.292 --> 00:38:32.584
Thank you!

406
00:38:32.917 --> 00:38:35.459
No sighting at the road into town.

407
00:38:51.584 --> 00:38:54.709
We bought for 200,000 won
when we first came to Korea,

408
00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:56.376
now you can scrap it for...

409
00:38:56.917 --> 00:38:58.167
How do you say 40?

410
00:38:58.167 --> 00:39:00.084
400,000 won.

411
00:39:00.376 --> 00:39:01.542
Shit car, shit car.

412
00:39:02.667 --> 00:39:04.001
Thank you.

413
00:39:04.501 --> 00:39:05.584
Thank you.

414
00:39:22.709 --> 00:39:25.626
It's day <i>2</i> of the hunt for fugitive Kwon,

415
00:39:25.626 --> 00:39:28.251
and it is expected to go on for a while.

416
00:39:28.251 --> 00:39:31.459
People have raised concerns

417
00:39:31.459 --> 00:39:34.584
about additional rapes and murders
with Kwon at large.

418
00:39:45.709 --> 00:39:48.292
I completely forgot to bring the painting.

419
00:39:49.459 --> 00:39:51.584
My memory isn't what it used to be.

420
00:39:52.084 --> 00:39:53.584
Chairman Chu Sang-duk?

421
00:39:54.709 --> 00:39:56.751
Chairman Chu...

422
00:39:59.626 --> 00:40:01.417
Oh, Hyosin Group?

423
00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:10.126
I'll get back to you
after reviewing the scene tomorrow.

424
00:40:22.709 --> 00:40:23.709
My painting...

425
00:40:23.917 --> 00:40:28.001
I'm a wanted man, so I had nowhere else to go.

426
00:40:28.417 --> 00:40:31.209
I snuck in without permission,
sorry about that.

427
00:40:43.542 --> 00:40:45.084
"112"

428
00:40:50.084 --> 00:40:54.001
When you came to visit with my mom,

429
00:40:54.876 --> 00:40:56.417
she mentioned

430
00:40:57.001 --> 00:40:58.542
a person who knows my alibi...

431
00:40:58.542 --> 00:40:59.834
- Alibi?
- Yes.

432
00:41:00.001 --> 00:41:02.126
Did you meet that person?

433
00:41:02.292 --> 00:41:04.626
You didn't escape to meet him, did you?

434
00:41:04.626 --> 00:41:09.167
I don't know who he is, but I need to meet him.

435
00:41:11.376 --> 00:41:14.876
It's weird that mom'd commit suicide
while prepping my appeal.

436
00:41:16.626 --> 00:41:18.751
I have to meet him and...

437
00:41:18.751 --> 00:41:22.876
It was a false tip, a prank call from kids.

438
00:41:24.917 --> 00:41:27.667
She took it really badly.

439
00:41:28.917 --> 00:41:31.334
She couldn't possibly look at you again.

440
00:41:33.251 --> 00:41:35.584
She cried for days,

441
00:41:35.584 --> 00:41:37.376
and chose her fate.

442
00:41:40.876 --> 00:41:44.376
This belonged to her. Recognize it?

443
00:41:52.334 --> 00:41:53.667
I called the police.

444
00:41:54.292 --> 00:41:57.417
I'll look into your case further,
give yourself up.

445
00:42:01.792 --> 00:42:02.751
Kwon Yu, freeze!

446
00:42:03.251 --> 00:42:04.417
He's not here.

447
00:42:07.584 --> 00:42:09.126
"Kwon Yu"

448
00:42:11.209 --> 00:42:12.417
"Fugitive Kwon Yu at large"

449
00:42:14.209 --> 00:42:14.876
"Police recover Kwon Yu's prison
uniform at a fishing site"

450
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:35.667
"ls Kwon Yu the Real Killer?"

451
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:44.959
Rapist and killer of a minor,
video game addict Kwon Yu...

452
00:42:44.959 --> 00:42:46.209
Mr. Hairy?

453
00:42:46.209 --> 00:42:50.626
There are many discrepancies
in the investigation of his case.

454
00:42:50.959 --> 00:42:54.626
The CCTV evidence submitted by the prosecution

455
00:42:54.626 --> 00:42:59.292
only has footages with Kwon
and nothing before or after.

456
00:42:59.959 --> 00:43:02.542
The prosecution said
it was a recorder malfunction.

457
00:43:03.251 --> 00:43:07.792
They also never knew about a dashcam footage

458
00:43:07.792 --> 00:43:09.834
that shows Kwon.

459
00:43:10.459 --> 00:43:14.001
The car owner wanted to use
this footage for just reasons

460
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:16.501
and sent it to a media outlet.

461
00:43:16.501 --> 00:43:20.626
But for an unknown reason,
the footage was mishandled,

462
00:43:20.626 --> 00:43:23.334
and it almost got buried in the station server.

463
00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:27.626
A newbie hacker was
hacking the station's servers

464
00:43:27.626 --> 00:43:29.834
and came across it by chance.

465
00:43:30.167 --> 00:43:33.167
Unlike the prosecution's argument,

466
00:43:33.167 --> 00:43:35.626
Kwon was seen entering and exiting the motel

467
00:43:35.626 --> 00:43:38.126
in exactly 3 minutes and 16 seconds.

468
00:43:38.459 --> 00:43:43.417
Is it logically possible
to have sex twice and stab her,

469
00:43:43.626 --> 00:43:47.209
then move the body to the washroom

470
00:43:48.001 --> 00:43:49.667
and scrub it of any evidence?

471
00:43:49.834 --> 00:43:54.126
In order to look into Ha Ji-su's
whereabouts prior to her death,

472
00:43:54.126 --> 00:43:57.001
we scoured her Facebook and lnstagram pages,

473
00:43:57.834 --> 00:44:02.292
and found her at a club <i>2</i> days
before her demise.

474
00:44:02.667 --> 00:44:07.001
It wasn't hard to find her in the club CCTV.

475
00:44:07.001 --> 00:44:10.292
3 AM, she left the club with a man,

476
00:44:10.292 --> 00:44:13.667
and her body was found a day
and a half afterwards.

477
00:44:13.667 --> 00:44:17.626
The man in question never became a suspect.

478
00:44:17.876 --> 00:44:20.251
But unemployed Kwon Yu
was immediately arrested...

479
00:44:20.251 --> 00:44:21.584
"Gwangjin District Rape-Murder
Suspect in Custody"

480
00:44:21.584 --> 00:44:22.542
Cap! Get out of there!

481
00:44:22.542 --> 00:44:24.084
The manager's onto you!

482
00:44:25.667 --> 00:44:27.751
Hello? The fugitive...

483
00:44:33.792 --> 00:44:36.501
Cap, come to Namyang Cafe' in Bukchang district.

484
00:44:37.459 --> 00:44:38.501
Let's meet there.

485
00:44:42.542 --> 00:44:43.876
Welcome.

486
00:44:44.626 --> 00:44:46.417
Handsome young fella.

487
00:44:53.042 --> 00:44:54.501
Good bye, sweetie!

488
00:44:59.292 --> 00:45:00.751
This is Namyang Café.

489
00:45:01.834 --> 00:45:03.001
Mr. Hairy?

490
00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:06.167
Is there someone named 'Captain'?

491
00:45:08.751 --> 00:45:10.542
Is there a 'Captain'?

492
00:45:15.917 --> 00:45:17.876
Is this a prank call?

493
00:45:18.917 --> 00:45:21.417
Eh? You're 'Captain'?

494
00:45:21.417 --> 00:45:25.501
Mr. Hairy? Is this the right place?

495
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:27.209
I just got here.

496
00:45:27.417 --> 00:45:28.417
Where are you?

497
00:45:45.667 --> 00:45:48.751
Who are you? What's going on?

498
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:56.501
Did Mr. Hairy send you?

499
00:45:56.501 --> 00:45:58.876
"Mr. Hairy"

500
00:46:01.751 --> 00:46:02.667
Mr. Hairy?

501
00:46:03.251 --> 00:46:05.334
What's going on here?

502
00:46:06.001 --> 00:46:08.376
Who is this person?

503
00:46:10.209 --> 00:46:12.042
Is she trustworthy?

504
00:46:12.876 --> 00:46:14.584
- You can't just...
- It's me.

505
00:46:15.667 --> 00:46:16.459
What?

506
00:46:17.834 --> 00:46:19.251
The one in front of you.

507
00:46:19.251 --> 00:46:20.209
Hello?

508
00:46:21.917 --> 00:46:23.209
I'm Mr. Hairy.

509
00:46:30.792 --> 00:46:33.751
But your voice...

510
00:46:34.501 --> 00:46:36.209
There's a voice app.

511
00:46:37.001 --> 00:46:39.001
It's a voice modulator.

512
00:47:32.542 --> 00:47:33.542
"Mr. Hairy"

513
00:47:37.417 --> 00:47:38.876
Sit anywhere.

514
00:47:40.126 --> 00:47:41.626
It's safe here.

515
00:47:52.542 --> 00:47:54.126
Rice delivery!

516
00:47:54.917 --> 00:47:56.917
Leave it right there.

517
00:47:57.792 --> 00:47:59.542
Who could be living here?

518
00:48:04.292 --> 00:48:05.251
Holy cow!

519
00:48:12.209 --> 00:48:13.251
Is this rice?

520
00:48:14.126 --> 00:48:16.501
Don't you live alone?

521
00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:19.376
Where do you want it, Mr. Hairy?

522
00:50:04.084 --> 00:50:04.959
Yeah?

523
00:50:09.917 --> 00:50:11.751
They'll be here soon.

524
00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:16.209
Don't let them see you like this,
you're still Cap.

525
00:50:27.376 --> 00:50:28.667
That was a hike.

526
00:50:35.376 --> 00:50:37.084
Mr. Hairy! We want some too.

527
00:50:37.459 --> 00:50:38.542
Extra portion for me.

528
00:50:38.542 --> 00:50:39.626
Looks delicious!

529
00:50:40.751 --> 00:50:43.126
This neighborhood's making me hungry.

530
00:50:43.126 --> 00:50:44.959
I thought I was gonna starve
to death on that hike.

531
00:50:44.959 --> 00:50:47.792
No CCTVs around, and pretty safe too.

532
00:50:47.792 --> 00:50:48.751
Right, Cap?

533
00:50:48.751 --> 00:50:50.751
So we finally get to meet?

534
00:50:52.376 --> 00:50:53.209
Thank you.

535
00:50:53.209 --> 00:50:55.376
I bought some eggs on the way.

536
00:50:56.792 --> 00:51:01.292
We met Mr. Hairy yesterday for the first time.

537
00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:03.501
She never came to any get-togethers,

538
00:51:03.876 --> 00:51:07.792
but after hearing of your escape she called us.

539
00:51:07.792 --> 00:51:09.542
- Come on, sit.
- That wasn't all.

540
00:51:09.542 --> 00:51:13.626
She took control of my PC
and made me watch stuff.

541
00:51:13.626 --> 00:51:15.542
She only talks over the phone.

542
00:51:15.834 --> 00:51:19.084
Do you have sociophobia or something?

543
00:51:19.126 --> 00:51:22.584
I was moved, your documentary.

544
00:51:23.542 --> 00:51:25.376
Wait a minute, please.

545
00:51:25.376 --> 00:51:27.376
So you're all...

546
00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:28.959
This is Yong_Guru.

547
00:51:28.959 --> 00:51:31.501
When Yongsan mall went bust,

548
00:51:31.501 --> 00:51:35.292
he's a legendary technician
who became half-unemployed.

549
00:51:35.292 --> 00:51:37.334
And this is demolition.

550
00:51:38.501 --> 00:51:40.792
I'm demolition,
I work in a special effects team.

551
00:51:40.792 --> 00:51:43.084
Those cool stuff you see in films,

552
00:51:43.542 --> 00:51:44.834
I work on those.

553
00:51:44.834 --> 00:51:46.126
He's a newbie.

554
00:51:46.709 --> 00:51:48.417
And I'm...

555
00:51:48.417 --> 00:51:51.876
negative Space, college architecture professor.

556
00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:54.667
Or so he says!

557
00:51:56.626 --> 00:51:57.417
So why are you all...

558
00:51:57.417 --> 00:51:59.626
We can't stand idle and let you get framed.

559
00:51:59.626 --> 00:52:01.001
We must all help!

560
00:52:01.042 --> 00:52:04.126
Thank you for the thought,
but I can do this on my...

561
00:52:04.126 --> 00:52:05.334
Come on!

562
00:52:05.334 --> 00:52:07.292
That's not right at all, we must help.

563
00:52:07.292 --> 00:52:09.376
I appreciate the thought...

564
00:52:09.376 --> 00:52:11.626
There's a couple who couldn't make it,

565
00:52:11.876 --> 00:52:13.334
COVER and CONCEAL.

566
00:52:13.334 --> 00:52:17.417
Online adult broadcasters,
who help the young and lonely!

567
00:52:17.417 --> 00:52:19.167
Stars in the adult industry!

568
00:52:19.709 --> 00:52:22.417
Did he mention where he was going?

569
00:52:22.501 --> 00:52:24.042
No, he didn't say.

570
00:52:30.334 --> 00:52:31.751
You must be a busy man.

571
00:52:31.792 --> 00:52:33.959
Yes, a little bit.

572
00:52:34.376 --> 00:52:38.209
If he calls, contact us right away.

573
00:52:38.417 --> 00:52:39.042
Okay.

574
00:52:39.042 --> 00:52:40.209
You may leave.

575
00:52:41.376 --> 00:52:42.001
Okay.

576
00:52:48.584 --> 00:52:49.751
Do you...

577
00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:53.626
still have his case files?

578
00:52:54.459 --> 00:52:55.834
May I review them?

579
00:53:00.042 --> 00:53:03.542
Stop nosing around and stick to your job.

580
00:53:03.876 --> 00:53:05.292
Mr. Public Defender.

581
00:53:05.334 --> 00:53:06.417
Sure...

582
00:53:07.167 --> 00:53:08.209
Yes, Ms. Lee.

583
00:53:08.209 --> 00:53:12.751
I visited the site
of Chairman Chu's job earlier.

584
00:53:12.751 --> 00:53:16.876
I sent you Kwon Yu's prison record
to your e-mail.

585
00:53:22.084 --> 00:53:23.334
Kwon Yu...

586
00:53:26.626 --> 00:53:27.876
Ma Duk-su?

587
00:53:28.626 --> 00:53:32.792
Drug distribution, attempted murder,
human trafficking,

588
00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:34.667
dealing weapons to gangsters...

589
00:53:35.334 --> 00:53:38.459
Kwon's got balls for beating him up.

590
00:53:42.167 --> 00:53:44.417
You fucking asshole!
Look at the traffic behind you!

591
00:53:44.417 --> 00:53:46.959
I'll pour gasoline up your butt and light it!

592
00:53:46.959 --> 00:53:48.542
You impotent fuck!

593
00:53:48.542 --> 00:53:50.626
Take the bus, dipshit!

594
00:53:54.042 --> 00:53:57.834
62N6089, 'Foul Mouth'.

595
00:53:58.459 --> 00:53:59.917
Common pattern?

596
00:54:00.876 --> 00:54:04.584
I've dissected recent violent crimes

597
00:54:04.584 --> 00:54:06.626
that have similar traits.

598
00:54:06.626 --> 00:54:09.334
Must we talk on the phone?

599
00:54:09.667 --> 00:54:11.917
Am I the only one who thinks this is Weird?

600
00:54:11.917 --> 00:54:13.709
So what about the pattern?

601
00:54:13.709 --> 00:54:15.334
Most criminals tend to

602
00:54:15.334 --> 00:54:17.459
conceal the evidence as much as possible.

603
00:54:17.459 --> 00:54:20.209
Right, that's what anyone would do.

604
00:54:20.209 --> 00:54:23.042
But these cases' most important aspect is,

605
00:54:23.042 --> 00:54:27.042
all pieces of evidence are
displayed like an exhibition.

606
00:54:27.042 --> 00:54:28.792
Goosebumps!

607
00:54:28.792 --> 00:54:29.417
Hey!

608
00:54:29.459 --> 00:54:33.959
The suspects are caught
within 24 hours after the crime,

609
00:54:33.959 --> 00:54:36.417
and their identities are
exposed even before their trial.

610
00:54:36.417 --> 00:54:40.001
But those alone
can't be seen as common patterns.

611
00:54:40.001 --> 00:54:42.209
I think that's enough to establish a pattern.

612
00:54:43.042 --> 00:54:44.084
Do you feel this?

613
00:54:54.459 --> 00:54:56.792
Look at this screen.

614
00:54:56.792 --> 00:54:59.126
I scoured all CCTVs

615
00:54:59.126 --> 00:55:03.626
within 1 km of the motel when Cap went there.

616
00:55:03.626 --> 00:55:04.751
What about the truck?

617
00:55:05.334 --> 00:55:06.084
Do you see it?

618
00:55:06.084 --> 00:55:07.501
It's a composite!

619
00:55:07.959 --> 00:55:09.001
It's fake, look!

620
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:10.959
If you look at the time code,

621
00:55:10.959 --> 00:55:13.501
it looks like the truck was there for an hour.

622
00:55:13.501 --> 00:55:16.251
So they wanted to hide where it went.

623
00:55:16.709 --> 00:55:17.917
Right.

624
00:55:18.417 --> 00:55:21.501
Was the truck present on other cases too?

625
00:55:25.667 --> 00:55:27.209
Who are these guys?

626
00:55:27.334 --> 00:55:31.417
I cross-referenced their registered addresses.

627
00:55:32.834 --> 00:55:35.751
They all belong to a junkyard near lncheon.

628
00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:39.501
Negative and Yong were so jealous of me.

629
00:55:39.501 --> 00:55:42.334
Because I'm going with you.

630
00:55:48.792 --> 00:55:51.876
You're a god among us users.

631
00:55:52.751 --> 00:55:54.459
There! Look!

632
00:55:55.542 --> 00:55:57.001
It's really here!

633
00:55:57.292 --> 00:55:58.501
This is big!

634
00:56:00.834 --> 00:56:02.626
Mr. Hairy was right.

635
00:56:05.001 --> 00:56:07.751
Suits in a junkyard don't feel right.

636
00:56:08.751 --> 00:56:10.709
I'll follow the SUV,

637
00:56:11.042 --> 00:56:12.709
can you hold the fort here?

638
00:56:12.709 --> 00:56:13.542
<i>Me'?</i>

639
00:56:13.751 --> 00:56:16.167
Can you do it? Of course you can.

640
00:57:49.626 --> 00:57:52.126
Cap, that Audi from earlier is back.

641
00:58:03.167 --> 00:58:06.251
Eh? It's being changed into a fridge truck.

642
00:58:06.667 --> 00:58:07.667
Who are they?

643
00:58:08.209 --> 00:58:09.292
They're leaving.

644
00:58:09.459 --> 00:58:10.626
What do I do?

645
00:58:14.001 --> 00:58:15.251
Go after them?

646
00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:17.417
I don't have a vehicle.

647
00:58:20.501 --> 00:58:21.917
Are you a cop?

648
00:58:23.251 --> 00:58:24.792
Gramps! Step on it!

649
00:58:26.042 --> 00:58:27.501
I was a marine!

650
00:58:27.917 --> 00:58:29.584
Cap! Cap!

651
00:58:32.167 --> 00:58:33.751
There, it's that building.

652
00:58:34.001 --> 00:58:36.292
They were delivering a fridge.

653
00:58:37.209 --> 00:58:39.334
I tried everything to sneak in,

654
00:58:39.501 --> 00:58:42.542
but I couldn't, what do we do?

655
00:58:51.542 --> 00:58:52.626
I got it.

656
00:58:52.626 --> 00:58:54.959
Okay, negative, Yong, go in.

657
00:58:54.959 --> 00:58:58.792
Most technicians will
insist on coming in the morning.

658
00:58:58.792 --> 00:59:02.209
They don't come running like us,
we got responsibility.

659
00:59:02.209 --> 00:59:04.626
People nowadays lack strong will.

660
00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:08.001
This is our specialist.

661
00:59:08.501 --> 00:59:10.501
A legend in his field.

662
00:59:11.542 --> 00:59:13.126
I'll go take a look.

663
00:59:13.376 --> 00:59:15.792
Oh yeah, I don't know if you've heard,

664
00:59:15.834 --> 00:59:19.709
the manager of an apartment
near here got the axe.

665
00:59:20.209 --> 00:59:21.251
- He did?
- Yeah.

666
00:59:21.459 --> 00:59:25.292
He said he worked responsibly
and to his fullest...

667
00:59:25.292 --> 00:59:28.751
Yong_Guru, find the main server
and connect me to it.

668
00:59:29.001 --> 00:59:30.251
He wasn't just fussy,

669
00:59:30.251 --> 00:59:33.292
he was shameless, isn't that right?

670
00:59:33.292 --> 00:59:35.459
What's your opinion on that? Do you agree?

671
00:59:35.459 --> 00:59:36.376
I don't understand...

672
00:59:36.376 --> 00:59:38.584
Main server...main server...

673
00:59:38.584 --> 00:59:40.501
What I'm saying is...

674
00:59:40.917 --> 00:59:45.584
What was I saying? I lost my train of thought.

675
00:59:45.876 --> 00:59:47.417
What's your point?

676
00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:48.667
There isn't one.

677
00:59:50.251 --> 00:59:53.209
- There isn't?
- When I was 28 or so...

678
00:59:53.209 --> 00:59:54.834
- 28?
- That's right.

679
00:59:54.834 --> 00:59:56.959
- My hair?
- What about it?

680
00:59:56.959 --> 01:00:01.792
We're similar, you're shinier than me.

681
01:00:02.792 --> 01:00:04.792
What's taking so long?

682
01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:10.084
A problem can't be diagnosed
and patched up quickly.

683
01:00:10.084 --> 01:00:13.959
Everything has to be checked and double checked

684
01:00:13.959 --> 01:00:16.042
so that it doesn't happen again...

685
01:00:16.042 --> 01:00:17.251
It's done.

686
01:00:19.501 --> 01:00:24.376
But it's also self-explanatory to an expert.

687
01:00:25.126 --> 01:00:26.751
Mr. Hairy, it's online.

688
01:00:26.792 --> 01:00:28.334
Okay, thank you.

689
01:00:41.542 --> 01:00:43.459
Cap, #1306.

690
01:00:49.417 --> 01:00:50.501
13th floor clear.

691
01:01:16.334 --> 01:01:17.501
It's Noh Joon-young.

692
01:01:17.501 --> 01:01:18.501
You know him?

693
01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:20.376
He was the star of TV show 'Witch's Boyfriend'.

694
01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:23.167
It was huge, so he's the hot shit now.

695
01:01:23.751 --> 01:01:26.542
So that's Noh's place?

696
01:01:26.959 --> 01:01:29.876
It's that one! The delivered case!

697
01:01:42.542 --> 01:01:44.751
Why is he dead in there?

698
01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:46.542
They transported a body?

699
01:01:46.834 --> 01:01:50.001
Life is so futile, he was a rising star.

700
01:01:50.001 --> 01:01:51.501
Cap, we have a guest.

701
01:02:08.334 --> 01:02:10.042
What are they doing?

702
01:02:59.751 --> 01:03:01.542
Party prep is done.

703
01:03:40.584 --> 01:03:43.626
Covered in fingerprints, nails and saliva,

704
01:03:43.626 --> 01:03:47.042
it won't be easy to remove all evidence.

705
01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:50.292
I've put together a list of candidates.

706
01:03:50.292 --> 01:03:53.501
173 in total, unemployed and temps.

707
01:03:53.501 --> 01:03:56.084
Are you always so hasty?

708
01:03:56.084 --> 01:03:57.667
No need to hurry.

709
01:03:59.292 --> 01:04:02.292
Our team can work only
after the girl is chosen!

710
01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:04.001
I'm getting nonstop calls from Chairman Chu!

711
01:04:04.001 --> 01:04:05.626
Okay, okay, stop nagging.

712
01:04:08.417 --> 01:04:10.167
You know how this works,

713
01:04:10.167 --> 01:04:14.167
being out of work isn't the only criteria.

714
01:04:15.334 --> 01:04:16.501
Jeez...

715
01:05:12.667 --> 01:05:15.334
Let's backtrack Noh's steps.

718
01:05:46.251 --> 01:05:47.501
BOSS?

719
01:05:48.126 --> 01:05:49.834
He spent a lot of time there.

720
01:05:55.709 --> 01:05:58.209
He was addicted to hostess bars?

721
01:06:01.376 --> 01:06:05.834
Alright, let's take a look at the girls there.

724
01:06:22.209 --> 01:06:23.001
Hello?

725
01:06:23.001 --> 01:06:24.959
I sent you a profile,

726
01:06:24.959 --> 01:06:27.376
put together a headline and a rough draft.

727
01:06:27.376 --> 01:06:28.751
Due tonight.

728
01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:31.501
That won't be easy, I got other deadlines...

729
01:06:31.501 --> 01:06:32.501
What?

730
01:06:34.584 --> 01:06:35.834
You can't do it?

731
01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:40.584
Of course not. I'll get it done by...

732
01:06:40.584 --> 01:06:44.001
I'm paying you enough, just be thankful.

733
01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:49.042
Concept of this job is,

734
01:06:49.042 --> 01:06:53.792
"celebrity stalking bar girl's gruesome kill'."

735
01:06:54.876 --> 01:06:56.376
"Pureal Water Filter"

736
01:07:01.584 --> 01:07:02.834
Who's there?

737
01:07:02.959 --> 01:07:05.792
I'm here to change the water filter.

738
01:07:06.126 --> 01:07:07.209
Okay.

739

01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:04.792
Yes, Mr. Min.

Ms. Lee.

743
01:08:06.209 --> 01:08:10.459
I need to pull someone out from prison.

744
01:08:10.459 --> 01:08:11.501
ASAP.

745
01:08:12.834 --> 01:08:14.751
I dug into the owner of the condo,

746
01:08:14.751 --> 01:08:17.834
his name is Chu Sang-duk,
chairman of Hyosin Group.

747
01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:22.084
Why does an actor die in someone else's condo?

748
01:08:22.084 --> 01:08:23.167
I know.

749
01:08:23.542 --> 01:08:24.917
No quizzes.

750
01:08:27.501 --> 01:08:31.167
These are articles about Noh and Chu Ye-ri.

751
01:08:31.334 --> 01:08:32.376
Chu Ye-ri?

752
01:08:32.376 --> 01:08:33.834
Chairman Chu's child.

753
01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:37.501
The pieces are coming together.

754
01:08:37.501 --> 01:08:39.709
So that girl in the photo is getting framed?

755
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:40.626
I know!

756
01:08:40.626 --> 01:08:42.376
I said no quizzes.

757
01:08:46.167 --> 01:08:48.917
Mr. Hairy, can you find her?

758
01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:51.584
Do you see the print on this?

759
01:08:51.751 --> 01:08:54.792
They will go after her.

760
01:08:54.792 --> 01:08:56.084
I'll try.

761
01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:11.334

How would you like it?

765
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:24.167
As full looking as possible.

766
01:09:26.834 --> 01:09:28.584
Shampoo time.

767
01:09:28.584 --> 01:09:29.376
Okay.

768
01:09:42.042 --> 01:09:44.209
Cap, the bug is installed.

769
01:09:44.209 --> 01:09:45.084
Very good.

770
01:09:45.084 --> 01:09:46.167
How is it so easy?

771
01:09:46.167 --> 01:09:48.917
That's why you shouldn't click
on links in random texts.

772
01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:51.834
With one click, it's not your phone anymore.

773
01:09:52.834 --> 01:09:54.626
You fucking bitch!

774
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:56.292
Why aren't you answering me?

775
01:09:57.376 --> 01:09:59.626
Today's collection day, did you forget?

776
01:09:59.626 --> 01:10:01.417
- I'm sorry!
- Come here, bitch!

777
01:10:01.417 --> 01:10:03.542
Please give me a few more days!

778
01:10:04.209 --> 01:10:05.667
Give you a few more days?

779
01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:07.292
Fucking bitch!

780
01:10:07.459 --> 01:10:10.251
You don't answer me, don't pay me back!

781
01:10:12.001 --> 01:10:14.584
What are you looking at? Having fun?

782
01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:17.501
Sell your kidney if you have to!

783
01:10:18.459 --> 01:10:20.084
You don't deserve...

784
01:10:21.959 --> 01:10:23.126
Let me go!

785
01:10:26.376 --> 01:10:28.126

786
01:10:31.876 --> 01:10:33.667
I sent it last week.

787
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:37.667
What?

788
01:10:37.917 --> 01:10:39.251
No way!

789
01:10:39.542 --> 01:10:42.542
I have no more money to send him!

790
01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:45.584
If he need the money, go rob a house!

791
01:10:45.584 --> 01:10:49.126
How could you say that about your brother?

792
01:10:49.126 --> 01:10:52.209
You're being high and mighty
for sending a few bucks.

You bitch!

794
01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:54.334
Mom...

795
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:58.209
Do you know how I earned that money?

796
01:10:58.584 --> 01:11:00.376
Don't call me again.

Hi, I found a wallet.

810
01:11:56.917 --> 01:11:58.542
I'll pay you $300.

811
01:11:58.542 --> 01:12:00.542
It's on my bed upstairs.

812
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:02.876
I found this number in the wallet.

813
01:12:02.876 --> 01:12:04.126
It's her.

814
01:12:05.667 --> 01:12:08.376
The woman who called me.

815
01:12:08.917 --> 01:12:13.376
Heard of Pentaportra Condo
in Cheongdam District?

Yes, if you come here, I'll return it to you.

817

Thank you so much, I'll come right away.

818

Okay.

819
01:12:19.876 --> 01:12:22.292
She used the same method to lure me.

820
01:12:22.292 --> 01:12:23.584
We just have to catch her.

Hello? You must be tired.

833
01:13:06.001 --> 01:13:08.834
I understand what you're trying to do.

834

Yo, perv, you like breathing into the phone?

01:13:12.792 --> 01:13:15.126
Goddamn right, did you call me a perv?

836
01:13:15.126 --> 01:13:18.876
I'll slash your tummy
until intestines spill out.

837
01:13:18.876 --> 01:13:20.126
Slash...

838
01:13:21.209 --> 01:13:22.292
Oh man...

839
01:13:23.042 --> 01:13:24.792
You crazy fuck,

840
01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:26.417
are you really that bored?

841
01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:27.751
You're a bum, right?

842
01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:29.167
You're a freeloader, I can tell, dipshit.

843
01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:33.917
So a freeloader can't even make a call?
You whore!

844
01:13:33.917 --> 01:13:34.834
I'm sorry, mommy.

845
01:13:34.834 --> 01:13:38.376
I just wanna fuck, is that so much to ask?

846
01:13:39.292 --> 01:13:41.834
Are you turned on by my dirty mouth?

847
01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:44.459
So dirty talk turns you on, huh?

848
01:13:44.459 --> 01:13:47.126
You're the real perv, you won me over.

849
01:13:47.126 --> 01:13:49.417
Dear valued perverted client,

850
01:13:49.417 --> 01:13:52.209
get a handjob if you're in heat,
this isn't the sex hotline.

851
01:13:52.209 --> 01:13:56.751
You're a nasty hoe, fuck off, cumslut!

852
01:13:56.751 --> 01:13:57.709
Hello?

853
01:14:06.501 --> 01:14:07.834
It's done.

854
01:14:15.501 --> 01:14:17.917
Hello? ls this Mr. Bae Young-deuk?

855
01:14:17.917 --> 01:14:19.876
It's Goryeo Resources.

856
01:14:19.876 --> 01:14:23.251
We have an opening
for night construction shift.

857
01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:24.917
Are you available?

858
01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:26.042
Yes.

859
01:14:31.376 --> 01:14:34.584
You're exposed, go off the grid.

860
01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:37.001
It's him! Right?

861
01:14:37.001 --> 01:14:39.709
It's the fugitive, call the police!

862
01:15:25.792 --> 01:15:28.626
What the shit?! Move this truck!

863
01:15:28.876 --> 01:15:30.126
I'm so sorry!

864
01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:32.459
Back off at once!

865
01:15:33.459 --> 01:15:35.042
Yo, rapist!

866
01:15:35.751 --> 01:15:37.542
Been a While, mofo!

867
01:15:40.834 --> 01:15:42.292
He's coming to.

868
01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:43.751
- Pull him up.
- Yes, boss.

869
01:15:43.834 --> 01:15:45.792
Don't resist.

870
01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:50.126
Aren't you curious how I got out?

871
01:15:50.126 --> 01:15:51.667
Fuck, I'm curious too.

872
01:15:52.459 --> 01:15:54.792
Remember this? You shot me with this.

873
01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:56.626
Here it comes.

874
01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:03.917
Holy shit!

875
01:16:03.917 --> 01:16:05.334
Fuck, look at that bastard go.

876
01:16:05.334 --> 01:16:06.292
Hold him.

877
01:16:10.417 --> 01:16:12.209
Kwon Yu, here it comes.

878
01:16:29.667 --> 01:16:32.334
Give me the knife, I wanna cut his mouth.

879
01:16:39.626 --> 01:16:43.876
I'll widen your hole and bury you properly,

880
01:16:44.001 --> 01:16:45.876
so rest in peace, okay?

881
01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:47.584
Fugitive Kwon Yu!

882
01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:52.459
I'm calling while the fugitive is out of sight,

883
01:16:52.459 --> 01:16:54.126
please save me.

884
01:16:54.126 --> 01:16:58.876
We'll rescue you shortly, so please be calm.

885
01:16:59.917 --> 01:17:00.876
Boss?

886
01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:03.417
The cops want this bastard.

887
01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:04.334
Don't mind them.

888
01:17:04.334 --> 01:17:06.334
The guy who got me out will take take of it.

889
01:17:06.792 --> 01:17:09.876
"Office Manager Ms. Lee"
Ms. Lee, we got one more task.

890
01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.501
Don't take any unnecessary actions.

891
01:17:11.501 --> 01:17:13.751
- Chief, chief!
- We'll move in shortly.

892
01:17:14.417 --> 01:17:16.209
The HQ ordered us to withdrawal.

893
01:17:16.626 --> 01:17:18.542
What do you mean? We got a hostage in there.

894
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:20.084
I'm not sure, that was the order.

895
01:17:20.084 --> 01:17:21.709
Officer! Please!

896
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:25.167
He's trying to kill me, please help me!

897
01:17:27.459 --> 01:17:29.751
Get in here, you fucking idiots!

898
01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:31.417
Execute! Execute!

899
01:17:33.084 --> 01:17:34.792
- What's that?
- What's going on?

900
01:17:48.084 --> 01:17:49.292
We surrender!

901
01:17:49.459 --> 01:17:51.876
- We're allies.
- Who are they?

902
01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:53.417
We're on the same side.

903
01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:10.501
Get in! Quick!

904
01:18:14.834 --> 01:18:16.084
What happened?

905
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:19.209
You left this in the middle of the road.

906
01:18:20.042 --> 01:18:21.042
Thanks!

907
01:18:21.167 --> 01:18:22.334
What's with the driving?

908
01:18:22.334 --> 01:18:23.542
I don't have a license.

909
01:18:23.542 --> 01:18:24.167
What?

910
01:18:24.209 --> 01:18:25.459
No license!

911
01:18:27.334 --> 01:18:29.167
Switch, I'll drive!

912
01:18:43.126 --> 01:18:44.292
By the way.

913
01:18:45.542 --> 01:18:47.584
How did the cops know my location?

914
01:18:52.917 --> 01:18:54.917
Yo, buddy!

915
01:18:55.751 --> 01:18:57.459
Match the speed, fuckface!

916
01:18:57.459 --> 01:18:59.917
Stop the car, bitch!

917
01:19:00.417 --> 01:19:02.667
Let's work on your hole!

918
01:19:03.876 --> 01:19:06.834
He's been on my ass like a hounddog.

919
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:11.042
Asshole! Turn this car around!

920
01:19:11.042 --> 01:19:12.209
Turn it around!

921
01:19:12.209 --> 01:19:14.709
Boss, we're on a ramp...

922
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:16.876
Turn it around, fucker!

923
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:21.251
What's that?

924
01:19:21.251 --> 01:19:22.709
Radio detector.

925
01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:24.917
Yong_Guru made it.

926
01:19:31.001 --> 01:19:33.709
Why is that in there?

927
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:35.001
Wait, wait!

928
01:19:35.292 --> 01:19:36.501
Please.

929
01:20:01.209 --> 01:20:05.626
We lost his signal there, so search thoroughly.

930
01:20:05.626 --> 01:20:09.667
Once you catch Kwon, you'll be a free man.

931
01:20:09.667 --> 01:20:12.709
So you got me out of the joint to bury Kwon.

932
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:14.501
You must be a powerful...

933
01:20:14.501 --> 01:20:16.792
Focus on catching Kwon.

934
01:20:16.792 --> 01:20:19.917
Or you'll be sent back to the joint.

935
01:20:21.292 --> 01:20:22.334
He hung up on me?

936
01:20:22.334 --> 01:20:24.834
So he gave you her necklace,

937
01:20:24.834 --> 01:20:27.834
but it contained a location tracker?

938
01:20:27.834 --> 01:20:32.917
And those gangsters were
supposed to be in prison?

939
01:20:32.917 --> 01:20:36.251
Without Mr. Hairy,
Cap could've been in a grave.

940
01:20:37.626 --> 01:20:39.709
So who really is that lawyer?

941
01:20:41.459 --> 01:20:45.042
Shouldn't we go after the lawyer first?

942
01:20:45.042 --> 01:20:46.792
Yong_Guru,

943
01:20:47.626 --> 01:20:49.626
can you make drones?

944
01:20:50.251 --> 01:20:51.417
Drone?

945
01:21:01.501 --> 01:21:03.042
So, how's the feed?

946
01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:04.709
Good, very clear.

947
01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:06.959
Oh, wait.

948
01:21:07.834 --> 01:21:10.459
Leather jacket, is that new?

949
01:21:10.459 --> 01:21:12.542
Mr. Hairy bought it for me...

950
01:21:15.376 --> 01:21:16.376
Yeah?

951
01:21:17.792 --> 01:21:20.459
Yong's pretty amazing at this.

952
01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:22.292
Yong_Guru, you're awesome.

953
01:21:22.501 --> 01:21:26.376
I can't believe this guy is unemployed.

954
01:21:26.876 --> 01:21:28.501
That leather smell...

955
01:21:28.542 --> 01:21:32.001
My dad beat me up for fooling around like this.

956
01:21:33.417 --> 01:21:35.126
"Attorney Min Chum-sang"

957
01:21:35.126 --> 01:21:37.084
I reviewed the raised estimate,

958
01:21:37.084 --> 01:21:40.042
and transferred the money to the operatives.

959
01:21:40.042 --> 01:21:41.584
Okay, good work.

960
01:21:41.667 --> 01:21:44.001
We can hear what they're saying in the office?

961
01:21:44.001 --> 01:21:47.334
It's using laser to detect soundwaves.

962
01:21:47.334 --> 01:21:48.751
That's the standard now.

963
01:21:50.584 --> 01:21:53.126
We completed your request.

964
01:21:53.126 --> 01:21:55.376
All leaked documents are destroyed,

965
01:21:55.376 --> 01:21:58.751
and related data are
stored securely for insurance.

966
01:21:59.334 --> 01:22:01.584
You know about Kwon Yu's escape, right?

967
01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.792
He already came here for a visit.

968
01:22:03.792 --> 01:22:07.084
Take care of it before it becomes a problem.

969
01:22:07.084 --> 01:22:11.626
Min is more capable than we imagined.

970
01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:14.792
Please calm the board for me.

971
01:22:14.792 --> 01:22:18.292
Long conversation could be compromising.

972
01:22:18.292 --> 01:22:20.334
See you at the meeting.

973
01:22:24.042 --> 01:22:26.042
"Attorney Min Chum-sang"

974
01:22:26.667 --> 01:22:29.209
So that idiot is the puppet master?

975
01:22:30.126 --> 01:22:33.834
How could he mastermind it
in a beat-up office like that?

976
01:22:33.834 --> 01:22:38.126
He needs a massive server farm,
that place looks unlikely.

977
01:22:38.126 --> 01:22:40.376
Maybe they have one off-site.

978
01:22:40.376 --> 01:22:42.251
Yong, did you bring the metal scanner?

979
01:22:42.584 --> 01:22:44.126
Send in another drone.

980
01:22:44.792 --> 01:22:46.584
Let's scan the building.

981
01:22:56.376 --> 01:22:58.792
Shit, it's embedded in there?

982
01:23:00.126 --> 01:23:01.876
It's like a huge safe.

983
01:23:02.417 --> 01:23:04.334
If they built a fortress,

984
01:23:04.334 --> 01:23:08.126
that means they got secrets
they want to protect, right?

985
01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:12.084
Can't Mr. Hairy hack the place?

986
01:23:12.084 --> 01:23:16.542
You could take over the PC like you did to us.

987
01:23:16.542 --> 01:23:20.459
I've been trying,
but I can't penetrate the firewall.

988
01:23:20.459 --> 01:23:21.751
Dammit.

989
01:23:21.751 --> 01:23:24.501
Everything'd be solved once we're inside.

990
01:23:24.501 --> 01:23:26.167
Negative, got any ideas?

991
01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:30.876
No one can get inside
unless someone opens the door.

992
01:23:31.042 --> 01:23:32.626
Let's just call the cops.

993
01:23:32.626 --> 01:23:33.834
What if they're on their side?

994
01:23:33.834 --> 01:23:35.626
Then get the media involved.

995
01:23:35.626 --> 01:23:39.834
Did Mr. Hairy's video get any air time?

996
01:23:39.834 --> 01:23:44.417
She's in hiding because that
put her on a watchlist.

997
01:23:48.042 --> 01:23:49.542
I have an idea.

998
01:24:02.667 --> 01:24:03.834
Hello?

999
01:24:03.917 --> 01:24:06.209
We got a problem.

1000
01:24:06.209 --> 01:24:06.917
What is it?

1001
01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:09.167
Noh's apartment was vandalized.

1002
01:24:14.751 --> 01:24:17.042
"You're finished, Min Chun-sang"

1003
01:24:19.167 --> 01:24:21.376
They wiped all fingerprints,

1004
01:24:21.376 --> 01:24:23.834
and mixed various hair samples.

1005
01:24:23.834 --> 01:24:26.417
We can't tell which belongs to So.

1006
01:24:29.167 --> 01:24:30.667
He's good.

1007
01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:33.459
How could you laugh?

1008
01:24:33.459 --> 01:24:35.626
The news will be out tomorrow.

1009
01:24:35.959 --> 01:24:37.167
What now?

1010
01:24:37.917 --> 01:24:39.834
Let's push back the D-Day.

1011
01:24:40.251 --> 01:24:43.459
Get the operatives to wipe this place down.

1012
01:24:50.834 --> 01:24:53.626
Send Noh's body to somewhere quiet.

1013
01:24:53.792 --> 01:24:55.626
A motel in the country, perhaps.

1014
01:24:55.626 --> 01:24:59.042
And collect So's samples again.

1015
01:24:59.042 --> 01:25:03.209
Dad, any updates from that Min bastard?

1016
01:25:03.209 --> 01:25:04.584
How long must I stay here?

1017
01:25:04.584 --> 01:25:07.626
The food is shit and I can't bear the stench!

1018
01:25:07.834 --> 01:25:09.001
Min Chun-sang!

1019
01:25:09.001 --> 01:25:11.334
- Is this how you work?
- Chairman Chu!

1020
01:25:11.334 --> 01:25:13.876
Do you know how much pain
my child is in right now?!

1021
01:25:13.876 --> 01:25:16.126
I raised her like a princess.

1022
01:25:18.376 --> 01:25:20.417
We're all working day and night,

1023
01:25:20.417 --> 01:25:22.292
so please be patient with us.

1024
01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:24.084
Pay me back! Answer me!

1025
01:25:24.501 --> 01:25:25.917
Give me my money!

1026
01:25:25.917 --> 01:25:27.459
Fucking hell...

1027
01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:33.376
What the hell, everything pisses me off.

1028
01:25:35.417 --> 01:25:37.167
Who the fuck?!

1029
01:25:38.126 --> 01:25:39.584
Okay, try it.

1030
01:25:52.042 --> 01:25:53.876
One, two, three!

1031
01:25:54.542 --> 01:25:56.584
"Party and Event Planners"

1032
01:25:59.417 --> 01:26:00.876
"We know what you're doing"

1033
01:26:01.334 --> 01:26:02.501
"What the hell?!"

1034
01:26:39.542 --> 01:26:42.376
Son of a bitch! Stop it! Please!

1035
01:26:47.501 --> 01:26:50.084
Kwon Yu is going after all of our operatives.

1036
01:26:50.084 --> 01:26:53.542
We can hire new people.

1037
01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:56.917
Do you want Chu's nagging to continue?

1038
01:26:56.917 --> 01:27:00.126
Let's finish the So job first.

1039
01:27:00.459 --> 01:27:01.751
No need to worry about Kwon,

1040
01:27:01.751 --> 01:27:04.417
I have him under control.

1041
01:27:04.417 --> 01:27:06.084
It's time for the news.

1042
01:27:09.501 --> 01:27:10.709
Let's watch together.

1043
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:13.084
I'm here at an unmanned motel in Yesan.

1044
01:27:13.334 --> 01:27:16.084
"Actor Noh Joon-young's body found in a motel"
After a week-long disappearance,

1045
01:27:16.084 --> 01:27:19.626
we received a tip that
Noh Joon-young was murdered.

1046
01:27:19.626 --> 01:27:21.417
The forensics unit is on the scene...

1047
01:27:25.584 --> 01:27:28.001
You can't come in here!

1048
01:27:28.417 --> 01:27:29.959
Move aside! Move!

1049
01:27:34.334 --> 01:27:36.084
It's Chu Ye-ri! Chu Ye-ri!

1050
01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:37.834
Take the picture!

1051
01:27:41.417 --> 01:27:44.917
"Actor Noh Joon-young's body found in a motel"

1052
01:27:46.334 --> 01:27:48.334
How long must I stay here?

1053
01:27:48.334 --> 01:27:51.376
The food is shit and I can't bear the stench!

1054
01:27:58.459 --> 01:28:01.126
Chu Ye-ri, the daughter of
Hyosin Group Chairman Chu,

1055
01:28:01.126 --> 01:28:06.001
was found at the crime scene
and was arrested for killing Noh.

1056
01:28:06.959 --> 01:28:10.709
What the hell's going on?!
Why was my daughter there!

1057
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:12.042
...difficult to deny charges.

1058
01:28:12.042 --> 01:28:16.084
Facing a tidal wave of criticisms,
Chairman Chu is confronting

1059
01:28:16.084 --> 01:28:18.751
the greatest threat of his life.

1060
01:28:19.126 --> 01:28:21.126
"Unknown Caller"

1061
01:28:30.876 --> 01:28:31.834
Kwon Yu?

1062
01:28:31.834 --> 01:28:33.292
How did you like it?

1063
01:28:33.792 --> 01:28:36.084
I copied your method.

1064
01:28:36.834 --> 01:28:39.417
Good, that was quite amazing.

1065
01:28:39.417 --> 01:28:42.251
It's weird to be complimented by
someone I want to kill.

1066
01:28:42.542 --> 01:28:47.209
That's the truth,
it's been pretty dull recently.

1067
01:28:48.834 --> 01:28:51.167
I got a surge of motivation,
it's turning me on!

1068
01:28:51.167 --> 01:28:53.292
It's been a long time.

1069
01:28:53.417 --> 01:28:55.334
Can you understand that?

1070
01:28:55.917 --> 01:28:59.209
This was quite fun in the beginning.

1071
01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:04.751
People would go to jail
based on the scenarios I created,

1072
01:29:05.126 --> 01:29:10.459
and with an article I wrote, people'd laugh,

1073
01:29:11.542 --> 01:29:15.417
or cry, or get enraged.

1074
01:29:15.417 --> 01:29:17.542
The sense of accomplishment...

1075
01:29:22.459 --> 01:29:26.334
So what, it's still a job
and it gets dull after a while.

1076
01:29:26.334 --> 01:29:27.876
Everything's the same.

1077
01:29:32.376 --> 01:29:35.292
But I'm ecstatic lately.

1078
01:29:35.917 --> 01:29:37.709
You're a threat.

1079
01:29:39.001 --> 01:29:41.667
No one has ever challenged me before,

1080
01:29:41.667 --> 01:29:44.584
but when you come after me,

1081
01:29:44.584 --> 01:29:48.417
it pisses me off, but it also feels amazing!

1082
01:29:52.084 --> 01:29:53.042
Hello?

1083
01:30:09.084 --> 01:30:13.167
How dare he hang up when I'm talking.

1084
01:30:13.501 --> 01:30:15.042
He hung up...

1085
01:30:16.542 --> 01:30:18.417
What a douchebag.

1086
01:30:21.501 --> 01:30:23.126
This is the problem.

1087
01:30:24.251 --> 01:30:28.209
Can't communicate with the Millennials.

1088
01:30:28.417 --> 01:30:30.084
It's quite serious.

1089
01:30:31.126 --> 01:30:32.376
Stupid Millennials!

1090
01:30:32.376 --> 01:30:34.792
I didn't ask for much! Did I?!

1091
01:30:35.042 --> 01:30:38.251
I was talking on the phone!

1092
01:30:38.251 --> 01:30:39.667
Can't communicate!

1093
01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:42.792
Can't get through to them.

1094
01:31:47.417 --> 01:31:50.001
That hurts, really badly.

1095
01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:55.792
That really hurts...

1096
01:32:26.792 --> 01:32:28.834
Are you still asleep?

1097
01:32:31.917 --> 01:32:32.834
Get up!

1098
01:32:32.834 --> 01:32:35.001
Were you up all night playing games?

1099
01:32:35.459 --> 01:32:36.542
How about a dojo?

1100
01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:38.167
No more taekwondo.

1101
01:32:39.209 --> 01:32:40.667
I'll set it up for you.

1102
01:32:41.001 --> 01:32:42.959
I'll never practice taekwondo ever again.

1103
01:32:45.542 --> 01:32:48.584
Please read this, my son is not a killer!

1104
01:32:48.584 --> 01:32:50.209
Please read this.

1105
01:32:50.292 --> 01:32:51.542
Isn't that fun?

1106
01:32:51.542 --> 01:32:53.251
Please read this!

1107
01:32:53.584 --> 01:32:56.209
It gets better towards the end.

1108
01:32:56.834 --> 01:32:59.501
Oh, and sorry for killing your mom.

1109
01:33:00.959 --> 01:33:04.251
I know it's late, but I apologize.

1110
01:33:12.292 --> 01:33:14.876
Be cool and listen to me...

1111
01:33:15.084 --> 01:33:16.251
Listen to me...

1112
01:33:16.542 --> 01:33:17.792
It's important...

1113
01:33:17.917 --> 01:33:18.917
Wait! Wait!

1114
01:33:19.042 --> 01:33:21.167
It's really important, you might regret...

1115
01:33:21.167 --> 01:33:22.126
Hey!

1116
01:33:24.376 --> 01:33:26.251
Know why this happened to you?

1117
01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.876
You were born to terrible parents.

1118
01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:31.834
Son of a bitch!

1119
01:33:32.459 --> 01:33:34.584
Fucking bastard!

1120
01:33:45.667 --> 01:33:48.292
I know you feel wronged.

1121
01:33:48.626 --> 01:33:55.626
But that doesn't excuse you
from hitting an older man.

1122
01:33:55.626 --> 01:33:56.834
You psycho...

1123
01:33:57.042 --> 01:33:59.209
Anyway, it's almost time.

1124
01:34:00.667 --> 01:34:02.084
"Mr. Hairy"

1125
01:34:03.334 --> 01:34:04.917
You should answer.

1126
01:34:09.792 --> 01:34:12.209
Yeo-wool? Hello?

1127
01:34:12.209 --> 01:34:15.042
Yo dipshit! Let's meet again!

1128
01:34:16.042 --> 01:34:17.834
Team name: : RESURRECTION.

1129
01:34:17.834 --> 01:34:22.417
Yong_Guru, demolition, negative Space,

1130
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:23.876
and Mr. Hairy.

1131
01:34:23.917 --> 01:34:27.292
They'll all die because of you.

1132
01:34:27.751 --> 01:34:28.792
L...

1133
01:34:31.334 --> 01:34:35.667
If you touch them, I will kill you, asshole!

1134
01:34:36.001 --> 01:34:40.001
Sorry for returning a threat with a threat,

1135
01:34:40.209 --> 01:34:43.417
but if you keep this up, they'll all die.

1136
01:34:46.167 --> 01:34:48.042
I think my ribs are broken.

1137
01:34:48.501 --> 01:34:51.042
I knew you'd come to steal my data.

1138
01:34:51.042 --> 01:34:54.501
That's why I sent Ma after your team.

1139
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:58.251
The server is huge,
it'll take about 30 minutes.

1140
01:34:58.626 --> 01:35:03.792
But you'll be a free man with that, though.

1141
01:35:05.667 --> 01:35:10.376
But your friends will die like dogs.

1142
01:35:11.626 --> 01:35:13.292
Too bad about that.

1143
01:35:15.751 --> 01:35:19.709
I will kill you and rescue my teammates.

1144
01:35:22.126 --> 01:35:24.834
I feel for your determination,

1145
01:35:28.292 --> 01:35:32.792
but I told Ma that if I don't call him in 15,

1146
01:35:32.792 --> 01:35:35.542
they should be executed.

1147
01:35:35.876 --> 01:35:37.876
Maybe I shouldn't have.

1148
01:35:38.417 --> 01:35:40.667
Just get the data.

1149
01:35:41.084 --> 01:35:43.001
You escaped to clear your name,

1150
01:35:43.001 --> 01:35:45.876
shouldn't you be on that?

1151
01:35:49.834 --> 01:35:51.959
Forget them.

1152
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:56.542
No one cares if they die.

1153
01:35:56.626 --> 01:35:58.001
They all eventually die...

1154
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:11.001
I forgot to mention something else, sorry.

1155
01:36:11.001 --> 01:36:14.792
That friend of yours, Mr. Hairy.

1156
01:36:15.334 --> 01:36:16.792
Yoon Yeo-wool.

1157
01:36:19.584 --> 01:36:21.459
She'll be So's replacement.

1158
01:36:21.459 --> 01:36:25.709
My men should be gathering her samples by now.

1159
01:36:27.501 --> 01:36:28.959
Mr. Hairy!

1160
01:36:28.959 --> 01:36:34.376
Hermit hacker murders popular actor Noh'.

1161
01:36:34.376 --> 01:36:37.959
The news will hit the web in the morning.

1162
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:39.626
Pretty cool, huh?

1163
01:36:41.834 --> 01:36:43.001
I might be a genius.

1164
01:36:43.459 --> 01:36:47.084
Stop, just stop it, asshole!

1165
01:36:47.084 --> 01:36:50.417
And your remaining friends,

1166
01:36:50.584 --> 01:36:54.626
I ordered Ma to kill them just now.

1167
01:36:55.334 --> 01:36:58.751
They'll be dead by the time you arrive,

1168
01:36:58.751 --> 01:36:59.876
so just skip town.

1169
01:36:59.876 --> 01:37:03.751
You'll arrive in time
to feel their cold bodies.

1170
01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:06.709
Don't do it! Son of a bitch!

1171
01:37:06.959 --> 01:37:08.501
Fuck!

1172
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:12.251
You shouldn't have touched me.

1173
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:14.084
Motherfucker!

1174
01:37:17.834 --> 01:37:20.584
Do you know why you'll die?

1175
01:37:21.876 --> 01:37:23.709
Who should I kill first?

1176
01:37:25.167 --> 01:37:26.667
Wait, please!

1177
01:37:26.876 --> 01:37:28.251
Old man, you first.

1178
01:37:36.292 --> 01:37:38.709
Negative!

1179
01:37:39.501 --> 01:37:40.709
He's not dead?

1180
01:37:41.001 --> 01:37:42.126
What's with this?

1181
01:37:42.376 --> 01:37:45.959
Wait! Let's talk! We can sort this out!

1182
01:37:50.167 --> 01:37:51.667
Is this defective?

1183
01:37:51.667 --> 01:37:53.876
You never served in the military.

1184
01:37:58.042 --> 01:37:58.876
Hot!

1185
01:38:00.292 --> 01:38:02.251
- Mr. Hairy!
- Get rid of her.

1186
01:38:03.751 --> 01:38:05.626
Get her outta here!

1187
01:38:05.876 --> 01:38:07.709
Don't do it! Fucking bastards!

1188
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:08.959
Give me your gun.

1189
01:38:13.459 --> 01:38:14.209
Idiot!

1190
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:15.959
Wait! Please!

1191
01:38:16.417 --> 01:38:21.501
Talk! Let's talk! Don't shoot me!

1192
01:38:21.501 --> 01:38:23.667
We can talk about this!

1193
01:38:23.667 --> 01:38:26.542
Look at me! You fugly piece of shit!

1194
01:38:26.542 --> 01:38:28.876
Look at me! You fuck!

1195
01:38:28.876 --> 01:38:32.501
Don't shoot! Don't do it! Asshole!

1196
01:38:32.501 --> 01:38:35.084
I can't concentrate! Shut the hell up!

1197
01:38:35.251 --> 01:38:36.667
You wanna die first?

1198
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:39.709
I have a mother...

1199
01:38:40.667 --> 01:38:41.626
Okay.

1200
01:38:42.251 --> 01:38:43.667
You still die first.

1201
01:38:43.667 --> 01:38:45.959
Wait, wait, mister, please just wait!

1202
01:38:46.084 --> 01:38:49.209
What happened? What's going on?!

1203
01:38:49.251 --> 01:38:51.042
I think it's a blackout.

1204
01:38:51.042 --> 01:38:53.292
Fuck, blackout?!

1205
01:38:53.834 --> 01:38:55.292
Boss! There!

1206
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:59.959
Stop! Stop shooting! Motherfucker!

1207
01:39:00.251 --> 01:39:01.834
Hey! Stop shooting!

1208
01:39:02.001 --> 01:39:03.417
Light your lighter!

1209
01:39:14.501 --> 01:39:15.667
Is he dead?

1210
01:39:17.126 --> 01:39:18.209
Did you find him?

1211
01:40:47.834 --> 01:40:49.501
Hurry! Hurry!

1212
01:40:49.709 --> 01:40:51.126
Negative, hurry!

1213
01:40:53.459 --> 01:40:54.542
Stop right there!

1214
01:40:54.626 --> 01:40:57.626
Get him, the one in leather jacket!

1215
01:41:02.251 --> 01:41:03.459
Stop!

1216
01:41:07.459 --> 01:41:08.834
Faster! Faster!

1217
01:41:15.667 --> 01:41:16.334
Go after them!

1218
01:41:16.417 --> 01:41:17.876
Get them!

1219
01:41:21.042 --> 01:41:22.751
They're coming!

1220
01:41:24.626 --> 01:41:27.751
Why are they fleeing?
He fights so fucking well!

1221
01:41:32.959 --> 01:41:34.417
Car in front!

1222
01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:43.751
It's too narrow! No way! Stop!

1223
01:41:49.584 --> 01:41:51.417
Let's go!

1224
01:41:57.834 --> 01:41:59.167
Goddammit!

1225
01:42:00.584 --> 01:42:02.626
That's the best you can do?

1226
01:42:02.626 --> 01:42:05.209
Give Yong-pal a call!

1227
01:42:05.209 --> 01:42:05.792
What?

1228
01:42:05.792 --> 01:42:08.084
Get Yong-pal, fuckface!

1229
01:42:08.084 --> 01:42:09.376
Get the car!

1230
01:42:09.917 --> 01:42:11.667
Hey, Ma!

1231
01:42:11.667 --> 01:42:14.709
I'll send you Kwon Yu's location,

1232
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:17.626
so please get him, I'm begging you!

1233
01:42:29.917 --> 01:42:32.167
Boss! I'm here!

1234
01:42:32.167 --> 01:42:34.292
Yong-pal to the rescue!

1235
01:42:34.751 --> 01:42:37.292
I'm gonna get you no matter what!

1236
01:42:49.834 --> 01:42:51.209
That looks fun.

1237
01:42:52.334 --> 01:42:54.917
Why don't I give him a hand?

1238
01:43:00.834 --> 01:43:02.709
It's the Foul Mouth.

1239
01:43:05.667 --> 01:43:06.292
What the hell?

1240
01:43:06.292 --> 01:43:08.667
How about a roller coaster ride?

1241
01:43:18.626 --> 01:43:20.626
Yong-pal, go! Go!

1242
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:22.167
GO! GO!

1243
01:43:31.042 --> 01:43:32.542
There, there!

1244
01:43:53.876 --> 01:43:55.667
Careful, careful!

1245
01:44:19.876 --> 01:44:21.334
Where am I?

1246
01:44:29.501 --> 01:44:31.167
What are those?!

1247
01:44:33.959 --> 01:44:35.376
Get that bastard.

1248
01:44:35.501 --> 01:44:36.917
Got it?

1249
01:44:36.917 --> 01:44:38.584
Get that bastard! Dammit!

1250
01:45:09.167 --> 01:45:10.667
Is this the TV station?

1251
01:45:10.667 --> 01:45:12.876
I'd like to report a tip.

1252
01:45:12.959 --> 01:45:15.876
It's about fugitive Kwon Yu...

1253
01:45:24.292 --> 01:45:27.584
ls that fucker really trying to kill us?

1254
01:45:32.084 --> 01:45:35.167
I feel so terrible.

1255
01:45:36.792 --> 01:45:38.709
Almost time for news.

1256
01:45:43.167 --> 01:45:44.501
Son of a bitch.

1257
01:45:45.084 --> 01:45:46.334
- Breaking news!
- Newsflash!

1258
01:45:46.334 --> 01:45:48.126
- This just in!
- Identity of Noh's killer...

1259
01:45:48.126 --> 01:45:51.292
...fugitive Kwon Yu

1260
01:45:51.292 --> 01:45:52.959
"Kwon Yu, murders Noh, kidnaps Chu Ye-ri"
was found to be real killer.

1261
01:45:52.959 --> 01:45:58.292
The CCTV footages secured by
the police show Kwon Yu

1262
01:45:58.292 --> 01:46:02.001
and his followers known as 'RESURRECTION'

1263
01:46:02.001 --> 01:46:04.667
kidnapping and moving Chu Ye-ri
to the crime scene.

1264
01:46:04.667 --> 01:46:07.209
The problem is the ragtag group.

1265
01:46:07.209 --> 01:46:08.917
"Kwon Yu followers assisted killing"
indulged in violent games...

1266
01:46:08.917 --> 01:46:10.251
Homemade bombs...

1267
01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:14.751
...a psychotic crime ring
that is on a crime spree.

1268
01:46:14.751 --> 01:46:17.751
They called us a psychotic crime ring.

1269
01:46:18.292 --> 01:46:20.417
Dammit! Now the police are on us!

1270
01:46:20.417 --> 01:46:21.917
It's getting more serious.

1271
01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:23.626
Get him before the cops do!

1272
01:46:23.626 --> 01:46:25.959
A large reward to whoever gets him!

1273
01:46:28.209 --> 01:46:32.376
Kwon Yu, so you're a game addict?

1274
01:46:32.792 --> 01:46:34.334
"Chairman Chu"

1275
01:46:35.709 --> 01:46:39.042
Mr. Min, I knew you'd pull it off!

1276
01:46:39.126 --> 01:46:41.042
You're a genius!

1277
01:46:46.751 --> 01:46:48.834
Are we gonna be okay?

1278
01:46:48.834 --> 01:46:49.876
We're almost there.

1279
01:46:54.751 --> 01:46:57.417
While fugitive Kwon was incarcerated,

1280
01:46:57.417 --> 01:47:01.917
he was known
to regularly assault fellow inmates.

1281
01:47:02.084 --> 01:47:04.376
Perhaps our society has created a monster,

1282
01:47:05.042 --> 01:47:09.626
"Revenge killing, are we safe?"
we must look back at...

1283
01:47:18.001 --> 01:47:19.251
Did you get that?

1284
01:47:21.292 --> 01:47:22.209
Cars are coming in here!

1285
01:47:22.209 --> 01:47:23.959
2 towing trucks are rushing in!

1286
01:47:36.001 --> 01:47:38.667
Yeo-wool got off, fetch her.

1287
01:47:38.667 --> 01:47:39.876
The girl's Yeo-wool, okay?

1288
01:47:39.876 --> 01:47:42.042
This is your last chance.

1289
01:47:42.042 --> 01:47:43.126
Buddy, I'm busy, I will...

1290
01:47:43.126 --> 01:47:44.709
Fuck, he hung up again?

1291
01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:47.001
He's got bad manners!

1292
01:47:50.834 --> 01:47:52.334
Okay, let's go!

1293
01:47:54.209 --> 01:47:55.167
Attention please.

1294
01:47:55.167 --> 01:47:59.834
Armed intruders are in the studio,
please evacuate the building.

1295
01:48:00.501 --> 01:48:02.501
Attention please...

1296
01:48:05.126 --> 01:48:07.334
Hurry, hurry!

1297
01:48:18.917 --> 01:48:20.001
Can you all hear me?

1298
01:48:20.001 --> 01:48:20.917
- Yes, Cap.
- Cap.

1299
01:48:20.917 --> 01:48:22.042
- Cap.
- Roger.

1300
01:48:22.042 --> 01:48:25.001
We need to buy Mr. Hairy some time
while she preps.

1301
01:48:26.876 --> 01:48:28.417
And thank you all.

1302
01:48:29.459 --> 01:48:30.501
For helping me.

1303
01:48:30.542 --> 01:48:33.792
How many times have you saved our asses?

1304
01:48:33.792 --> 01:48:35.042
Especially Mr. Hairy.

1305
01:48:35.042 --> 01:48:38.334
She leveled up by following Cap around.

1306
01:48:38.459 --> 01:48:40.251
We'll wipe them out.

1307
01:48:40.417 --> 01:48:41.792
This is not a game.

1308
01:48:42.167 --> 01:48:44.334
It could really get dangerous.

1309
01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:49.792
Alright, they're coming.

1310
01:48:50.084 --> 01:48:52.376
Cap, requesting order.

1311
01:48:54.876 --> 01:48:57.417
Okay, RESURRECTION, are you ready?

1312
01:48:57.417 --> 01:48:59.001
Let's fight without regret.

1313
01:48:59.001 --> 01:48:59.792
Roger

1314
01:49:00.084 --> 01:49:01.834
Yong_Guru, standby.

1315
01:49:02.959 --> 01:49:05.792
Steady, steady, steady...

1316
01:49:13.417 --> 01:49:14.292
Yes!

1317
01:49:14.667 --> 01:49:16.959
demolition, shoot when I pass.

1318
01:49:16.959 --> 01:49:18.042
Don't worry.

1319
01:49:18.042 --> 01:49:20.459
It'll be like The Dark Knight.

1320
01:49:20.876 --> 01:49:24.001
After you pass and the tow trucks arrive,

1321
01:49:24.001 --> 01:49:27.292
I'll flip them over with my wire.

1322
01:49:27.292 --> 01:49:31.167
I told you I work in the film industry.

1323
01:49:41.667 --> 01:49:42.834
Oh shit, that's not good.

1324
01:49:42.834 --> 01:49:45.334
I knew you were all bark.

1325
01:50:01.251 --> 01:50:02.834
Just smash into him!

1326
01:50:03.001 --> 01:50:03.959
Pass through!

1327
01:50:10.001 --> 01:50:10.834
Holy shit!

1328
01:50:13.917 --> 01:50:15.167
Cap, you okay?

1329
01:50:15.667 --> 01:50:16.626
I'm fine.

1330

Good job, Yong_Guru!

DEMO!

1334
01:50:49.501 --> 01:50:51.084
Cap is luring them towards you!

1335
01:50:51.084 --> 01:50:53.042
Not yet! Not ready!

1336
01:50:57.584 --> 01:50:59.334
No, no, not yet!

1337
01:51:01.251 --> 01:51:02.542
DEMO, now!

1338
01:51:19.126 --> 01:51:22.376
Okay, DEMO! Next phase!

1339
01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:24.126
Mr. Hairy!

1340
01:51:24.126 --> 01:51:24.792
Hairy!

1341
01:51:24.792 --> 01:51:26.376
What's going on? Yeo-wool?

1342
01:51:34.209 --> 01:51:35.334
Shut up!

1343
01:51:51.792 --> 01:51:53.167
So sorry!

1344
01:51:54.584 --> 01:51:55.542
My fault!

1345
01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:56.876
Hold still!

1346
01:52:26.084 --> 01:52:28.584
Yeo-wool! Yeo-wool!

1347
01:52:31.084 --> 01:52:32.834
Bye, mofo!

1348
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:43.876
Stupid bastard!

1349
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:46.042
Yeo-wool, crossover!

1350
01:52:47.126 --> 01:52:49.501
Stop it! Goddammit!

1351
01:52:53.167 --> 01:52:54.542
Boss! I'm here!

1352
01:52:57.334 --> 01:52:58.959
Motherfucker! Shoot straight!

1353
01:52:58.959 --> 01:53:01.042
Sorry, boss! What happened?

1354
01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:12.417
Useless fuck...

1355
01:53:18.292 --> 01:53:20.042
Closer, closer...

1356
01:53:26.917 --> 01:53:28.584
- Cap!
- Yeo-wool, hop in!

1357
01:53:29.334 --> 01:53:30.376
Fat chance!

1358
01:53:34.834 --> 01:53:36.042
Goddamn...

1359
01:54:27.209 --> 01:54:29.626
0187, suspect vehicle found.

1360
01:54:29.626 --> 01:54:31.626
Passing through Sangam Junction.

1361
01:54:32.376 --> 01:54:34.542

1362
01:54:34.751 --> 01:54:37.626
all units, converge at Sangam Junction.

1363
01:54:37.834 --> 01:54:39.959
Command Center, send support.

1364
01:54:41.584 --> 01:54:44.251
He's going around the TV station.

1365
01:54:44.834 --> 01:54:48.292
18, cut off his retreat route,
lure him into 3rd block.

1366
01:54:49.126 --> 01:54:51.709
Sniper unit, you are free to open fire,

1367
01:54:52.042 --> 01:54:53.792
the suspect may be armed.

1368
01:54:53.917 --> 01:54:55.959
Fugitive Kwon Yu is coming in now!

1369
01:54:55.959 --> 01:54:58.126
He may be hereto give himself up.

1370
01:54:58.126 --> 01:55:00.834
You're watching a live footage.

1371

"Live Feed of Kwon Yu's Arrest"

1372
01:55:37.584 --> 01:55:39.334
What's wrong with this?

1373
01:55:54.626 --> 01:55:56.417
Wake up, we're here.

1374
01:55:58.084 --> 01:55:59.501
We're here already?

1375
01:55:59.501 --> 01:56:01.209
Cap, I brought COVER and CONCEAL.

1376
01:56:01.209 --> 01:56:03.542
Cap, I missed you!

1377
01:56:03.542 --> 01:56:04.792
There she goes again.

1378
01:56:04.792 --> 01:56:06.876
It's been tough, huh?

1379
01:56:06.876 --> 01:56:08.209
Good to hear your voice.

1380
01:56:08.209 --> 01:56:11.459
Mr. Hairy, did you get all the data?

1381
01:56:37.417 --> 01:56:38.751
Completely.

1382
01:56:43.959 --> 01:56:47.959
Mr. Hairy'll block regular news
and broadcast ours.

1383
01:56:47.959 --> 01:56:49.334
Do this properly.

1384
01:56:49.584 --> 01:56:52.542
They'll fuse together if you keep at it.

1385
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:53.959
So nervous...

1386
01:56:53.959 --> 01:56:55.334
Are you ready?

1387
01:56:59.917 --> 01:57:04.042
Killer of the Century, Kwon Yu's truth

1388

will be brought to you exclusively on 69 Enter.

1389
01:57:08.251 --> 01:57:11.459
Did he really murder hottie Noh Joon-young?

1390
01:57:11.459 --> 01:57:13.417
Is this the truth?

1391
01:57:19.084 --> 01:57:21.959
My daughter messed up.

1392
01:57:21.959 --> 01:57:25.167
He's an actor named Noh Joon-young.

1393
01:57:25.167 --> 01:57:27.376
I think he's a goner.

1394
01:57:27.376 --> 01:57:30.459
This is Hyosin Group's Chairman.

1395
01:57:30.459 --> 01:57:32.459
Daddy, I'm hungry.

1396
01:57:32.459 --> 01:57:35.459
That bitch is Noh's killer.

1397
01:57:35.459 --> 01:57:39.917
Then what's the real truth
behind Kwon Yu's rape-murder?

1398
01:57:39.917 --> 01:57:43.376
My son made a mistake, he must've been drunk.

1399
01:57:43.376 --> 01:57:48.459
He's prone to mistakes at his age,
even killing.

1400
01:57:48.459 --> 01:57:51.334
You must be anxious before the big day.

1401
01:57:51.334 --> 01:57:52.834
- Isn't that you?
- What?

1402
01:57:52.834 --> 01:57:54.959
The one who killed Ha Ji-su...

1403
01:57:54.959 --> 01:57:56.167
I'm so fucked...

1404
01:57:56.167 --> 01:57:59.042
was the son of Councilor Park,
who wrote the Kwon Yu Bill.

1405
01:57:59.042 --> 01:58:01.876
But Kwon Yu was arrested instead.

1406
01:58:01.876 --> 01:58:03.209
Did you see the news?

1407
01:58:03.209 --> 01:58:05.501
Will Kwon reach the trial?

1408
01:58:05.501 --> 01:58:08.167
- I'm Min Chun-sang.
- Motherfuckers!

1409
01:58:08.376 --> 01:58:09.917
"Motherfuckers"...

1410
01:58:11.042 --> 01:58:12.584
I'm reaching my boiling point.

1411
01:58:12.584 --> 01:58:13.792
This is news!

1412

Ms. Lee...Ms. Lee?

1413

Aren't you curious who the puppet master is?

1414
01:58:22.584 --> 01:58:24.417
Min, I'm in trouble.

1417
01:58:29.042 --> 01:58:32.376
a container in Jamsil tomorrow.

1418

01:58:35.042 --> 01:58:36.459

- Min!

1420
01:58:36.459 --> 01:58:37.959
You saved my neck!

How should I pay you?

1424
01:58:43.667 --> 01:58:47.542
My office manager will contact you soon.

1425
01:58:47.542 --> 01:58:50.042
Mr. Min, you're a genius.

1426
01:58:50.042 --> 01:58:52.709
Yes, I may be one.

1427
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:55.084
You're a natural born.

1428

Detectives, please, I'm so sorry!

1429

and with an article I wrote, people'd laugh...

1432
01:59:07.876 --> 01:59:12.292
Min Chun-sang is the bastard
who controlled everything.

1433

That's enough, you fuckers!

1434

This is the guy who deserves to die.

1435

Stop it!

We are going to release our data
before turning them over,

so anyone who are wronged by him can use them.

1438
01:59:25.417 --> 01:59:30.001
And officers, grab Min before he takes off!

1439

How dare they challenge me?

Min Chun-sang, I took your wheel, asshole!

1442

What do we do? He's completely exposed.

1443
01:59:53.917 --> 01:59:57.584
Don't worry, he's replaceable.

1 wrong conviction is
worse than losing 10 criminals.

Guys, what are you doing?
You shouldn't do that.

1455

Kwon Yu, who was framed and jailed for murder,

1456
02:01:10.667 --> 02:01:13.709
was cleared of all charges
and became a free man.

also gathering public opinions

And the son of Councilor Park,

1462
02:01:30.501 --> 02:01:35.459
Park Jae-hyun was arrested after hiding
in a motel for 40 days.

1463
02:01:43.876 --> 02:01:47.834
They all said the tree was rotting.

1464
02:01:49.709 --> 02:01:54.459
But I told them it's far from it.

1465
02:01:55.376 --> 02:01:58.834
I had a dream that night.

1466
02:01:59.917 --> 02:02:01.584
In the dream,

1467
02:02:01.959 --> 02:02:09.126
I saw the tree grow strong
towards the blue sky.

1468
02:02:11.167 --> 02:02:16.334
I gathered everyone
and said the tree wasn't rotting.

1469
02:02:18.834 --> 02:02:22.542
This tree is not a rotting one.
