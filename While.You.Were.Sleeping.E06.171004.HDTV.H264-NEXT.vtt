00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:09.883
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:20.954
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:39.744 --> 00:00:43.315
Burns can get infected if they're not treated properly.

4
00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:46.214
Bring your face closer.

5
00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:48.085
Don't worry about it. I'll put it on myself.

6
00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:54.724
What are you doing now?

7
00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:57.795
My goodness, it has turned into a blister.

8
00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:00.464
You'll probably be hospitalized if you make breakfast again.

9
00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:06.464
Gosh, I said I can put it on myself.

10
00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:08.474
Have you had a chance to talk with your brother?

11
00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:11.744
Don't even get me started.

12
00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.174
He yelled at me and said I shouldn't even call myself a prosecutor.

13
00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:17.275
I was so worried about him. He doesn't even know that I saved him.

14
00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.845
It's so unrewarding.

15
00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:19.984
I know, right?

16
00:01:20.444 --> 00:01:21.785
That girl, So Yoon, is the same.

17
00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:25.125
I let her stay at my place because I was worried about her.

18
00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:27.825
She should really be thanking me,

19
00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:29.724
but all she does is lash out at me.

20
00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:35.934
Why did we even do all that to save them?

21
00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:41.234
You got a cut on your finger too, right? Let me see.

22
00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:01.625
Other people may not know, but I do.

23
00:02:02.654 --> 00:02:04.194
You tried so hard.

24
00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:17.704
Good work.

25
00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.115
You too.

26
00:03:15.265 --> 00:03:16.365
Gosh, you startled me.

27
00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:18.734
Jae Chan, what brings you here?

28
00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:21.005
There's something I want to tell you.

29
00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:22.404
What is it?

30
00:03:23.134 --> 00:03:26.505
I'll aim to start at a level higher than Grade Nine.

31
00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:27.644
What?

32
00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:31.375
Did you hear everything that night?

33
00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:36.085
Hey, do you even know what it means?

34
00:03:36.585 --> 00:03:38.684
Actually, I don't know. What is it?

35
00:03:47.565 --> 00:03:49.565
Do you always wear glasses? You don't have contact lenses?

36
00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:51.664
I do, but they're such a hassle.

37
00:03:54.204 --> 00:03:55.375
Why do you ask?

38
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:56.535
Do I look better without glasses?

39
00:03:56.605 --> 00:03:59.204
No, it was all fogged up earlier, so I thought it might be annoying.

40
00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:00.974
No, it doesn't bother me at all.

41
00:04:01.105 --> 00:04:02.515
Why does it bother you?

42
00:04:02.515 --> 00:04:04.075
Do I look different without my glasses?

43
00:04:04.075 --> 00:04:05.115
Are you even more smitten?

44
00:04:05.484 --> 00:04:07.214
Keep wearing them if it doesn't bother you.

45
00:04:08.954 --> 00:04:11.115
If you're bothered, I'll gladly take them off.

46
00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:15.394
By the way, what's going on with the Park Jun Mo case?

47
00:04:15.525 --> 00:04:16.795
You'll re-investigate it, right?

48
00:04:17.694 --> 00:04:20.694
It's all over. How can I re-investigate it?

49
00:04:20.724 --> 00:04:22.335
You'll turn a blind eye to it once again?

50
00:04:22.464 --> 00:04:24.035
Even after all that ruckus last night?

51
00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:25.865
Your brother almost killed someone.

52
00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:30.704
I saved my brother, so it's all good now.

53
00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.244
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:32.244 --> 00:04:34.375
You have to find more evidence and indict Park Jun Mo.

55
00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:35.615
With what?

56
00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:37.414
Shall I say he beat her up in your dream?

57
00:04:37.414 --> 00:04:39.244
Do you want me to indict him with no evidence?

58
00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:40.845
- Today is the deadline. - Get it extended!

59
00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:42.454
I can't keep getting it extended.

60
00:04:42.454 --> 00:04:44.815
I have over 300 cold cases to work on this month alone.

61
00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:47.825
If I insist on re-investigating this obvious case,

62
00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:49.825
I'll get transferred to some faraway place.

63
00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:52.394
I don't have any connections, so I might even get fired.

64
00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:54.994
You'll bury it just because you're scared of getting fired?

65
00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:57.394
That's right. I'm scared of being fired.

66
00:04:57.394 --> 00:05:00.105
Listen. I had to scrap my new car because of that accident.

67
00:05:00.105 --> 00:05:01.974
I have 36 months left on my auto loan.

68
00:05:01.974 --> 00:05:03.474
I also have to pay the interest on my home loan,

69
00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:05.174
so I never have any money in my bank account.

70
00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:08.204
My eyes are welling up with tears again.

71
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.444
Taxi!

72
00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:13.244
Memorize this, okay?

73
00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:17.055
45-15-35-43-27-33.

74
00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:19.325
What is that?

75
00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:20.924
This week's winning lottery number.

76
00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:22.025
I saw it in my dream.

77
00:05:23.224 --> 00:05:27.094
I never buy lottery tickets even if I see winning numbers in my dream,

78
00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:28.534
but I'll only share this information with you.

79
00:05:28.764 --> 00:05:30.795
It's for 2.8 million dollars.

80
00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:32.835
Stop spewing total nonsense.

81
00:05:33.605 --> 00:05:34.905
Do you expect me to believe that?

82
00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:36.704
Yes, and run at them.

83
00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:40.275
Because getting fired won't be a problem if I win 2.8 million?

84
00:05:40.275 --> 00:05:42.244
Think of it as an insurance and just do it.

85
00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:47.844
Do you think I look like a pathetic loser...

86
00:05:47.844 --> 00:05:49.554
who bites his tongue because of money?

87
00:05:49.614 --> 00:05:50.885
Well, I'm just...

88
00:05:51.414 --> 00:05:54.684
You talked about your loan and car payment.

89
00:05:54.724 --> 00:05:57.125
I'm not the type of person who chooses what to say...

90
00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:59.125
and what to hold back based on money.

91
00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:00.664
Taxi!

92
00:06:12.675 --> 00:06:13.974
What was that about?

93
00:06:14.175 --> 00:06:16.945
He loves to bluff, but he's so inconsistent.

94
00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:19.744
He's cool though.

95
00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:47.474
What's that on your forehead? Did you get a pimple?

96
00:06:48.445 --> 00:06:49.875
Let's have lunch together.

97
00:06:50.445 --> 00:06:52.784
I promised you that I'd buy you sushi. Let's do it today.

98
00:06:53.315 --> 00:06:55.385
I'm the prosecutor in charge of your case.

99
00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:56.684
Not anymore.

100
00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:00.324
You've been acting so feisty. Was it all for a show?

101
00:07:00.724 --> 00:07:03.125
I saw that you decided not to indict Mr. Park and drop the case.

102
00:07:03.494 --> 00:07:04.755
Who said I dropped the case?

103
00:07:05.494 --> 00:07:07.025
Mr. Choi told me.

104
00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:09.965
I haven't submitted it to Mr. Park yet.

105
00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:12.164
I've been studying the documents,

106
00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:14.005
and it doesn't look like I can let it go.

107
00:07:14.005 --> 00:07:15.074
Hey!

108
00:07:18.074 --> 00:07:21.074
It's an assault case, and the victim doesn't want him to be punished.

109
00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:25.585
What on earth are you saying, Jae Chan?

110
00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.085
That will only work when it's a simple assault case.

111
00:07:31.824 --> 00:07:34.755
I also noticed a few other things that seem suspicious.

112
00:07:35.094 --> 00:07:37.054
There are people who need to be summoned as well.

113
00:07:38.394 --> 00:07:39.864
Things that seem suspicious?

114
00:07:40.565 --> 00:07:42.295
People who need to be summoned?

115
00:07:45.204 --> 00:07:46.735
There's no such thing.

116
00:07:47.565 --> 00:07:49.635
You won't find anything even if you study those documents for months.

117
00:07:50.275 --> 00:07:53.775
Know with whom you're dealing with if you want to bluff away.

118
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:55.644
Jae Chan.

119
00:07:57.775 --> 00:07:59.114
I know what card you're holding.

120
00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:09.054
Yu Beom,

121
00:08:09.724 --> 00:08:11.764
do you know what's more awful than not knowing anything?

122
00:08:17.295 --> 00:08:18.864
Thinking that you know everything.

123
00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.425
I must've totally lost my mind.

124
00:08:46.764 --> 00:08:48.994
Why did I bluff like that? How am I going to handle it all?

125
00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:50.795
Gosh.

126
00:08:52.664 --> 00:08:56.034
45-15-35-43-27-33.

127
00:08:57.275 --> 00:09:00.405
45-15-35-43-27-33.

128
00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.784
Ms. Moon! Just a second.

129
00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:08.914
You're taking them to Mr. Park, right?

130
00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:10.885
Do I look like I'm taking them out for recycling?

131
00:09:11.155 --> 00:09:12.155
Just a moment, okay?

132
00:09:13.355 --> 00:09:14.355
What are you doing now?

133
00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:17.195
I want to dig the Park Jun Mo case again.

134
00:09:19.494 --> 00:09:20.594
Great, found it.

135
00:09:25.135 --> 00:09:27.465
All he does is dig. Is he a groundhog or what?

136
00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:29.934
This is why we still have a mountain of cold cases.

137
00:09:30.005 --> 00:09:33.375
Being excruciatingly slow is a lot worse than being stupid.

138
00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:35.244
I feel bad for you.

139
00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:50.655
- Mr. Choi. - Yes.

140
00:09:50.655 --> 00:09:52.425
Please summon Mr. Park Jun Mo.

141
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.164
I'd like the doctor from Kiyoung Hospital and the victim, Ms. Do,

142
00:09:55.164 --> 00:09:56.864
to be cross-examined, so summon them for the same day.

143
00:09:56.864 --> 00:09:59.335
I thought the case got closed because it's not prosecutable.

144
00:10:00.364 --> 00:10:01.565
I brought it back.

145
00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:03.235
I see.

146
00:10:03.335 --> 00:10:06.545
Oh, right. Please tell the doctor to bring copies of all records.

147
00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:07.545
Sure.

148
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.914
Gosh, this means I have to work late again.

149
00:10:11.315 --> 00:10:13.284
I love you, Mr. Choi.

150
00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:16.784
Why are you calling my office? You have my cell phone number.

151
00:10:16.885 --> 00:10:18.985
This makes me feel like we're all about work, which we aren't.

152
00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.625
This call is about work.

153
00:10:21.184 --> 00:10:23.824
Prosecutor Jung wants to summon Mr. Park to re-investigate the case.

154
00:10:23.824 --> 00:10:25.164
I want to see which dates work for him.

155
00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:30.264
Goodness, he's going overboard.

156
00:10:30.335 --> 00:10:31.594
He can send us any questions he has.

157
00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:33.434
I don't think you understand what's going on.

158
00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:36.875
It looks like he'll even request a warrant if Mr. Park doesn't come.

159
00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:38.304
Then it'll turn into a huge headache.

160
00:10:38.644 --> 00:10:39.945
I can't let that happen.

161
00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:44.014
I'll talk to him so that you won't have to worry about such a headache.

162
00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.085
Okay. Salute.

163
00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:50.014
Darn it! Jae Chan, that jerk. How dare he!

164
00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:54.724
Yes, Mr. Lee.

165
00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:58.054
Track down Park Jun Mo's wife and daughter.

166
00:10:58.155 --> 00:10:59.224
Got it.

167
00:10:59.864 --> 00:11:02.864
I notified him of the summons, but I don't think it'll be easy.

168
00:11:03.394 --> 00:11:04.835
I didn't think it'd be easy.

169
00:11:04.835 --> 00:11:06.304
Right. Yes.

170
00:11:06.664 --> 00:11:08.105
Prosecutor Jung.

171
00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:10.434
Mr. Park would like to see you.

172
00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:21.644
45-15-35-43-27-33.

173
00:11:21.855 --> 00:11:24.284
45-1... Gosh.

174
00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:26.554
(Assistant Chief Prosecutor Park Dae Young)

175
00:11:26.554 --> 00:11:29.755
45-15-35-43-27-33.

176
00:11:35.364 --> 00:11:36.795
Hey, come on in.

177
00:11:38.505 --> 00:11:41.335
I must say, your good looks...

178
00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:44.135
surely have made a positive contribution to our division.

179
00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:48.744
It'd be amazing if you could also contribute to boosting...

180
00:11:48.815 --> 00:11:50.175
the team's performance.

181
00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:52.715
I'll do my best.

182
00:11:55.255 --> 00:11:56.514
Thank you.

183
00:11:58.085 --> 00:11:59.284
Have some tea.

184
00:12:00.824 --> 00:12:03.025
I noticed that the Park Jun Mo case isn't included in the pile...

185
00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:05.094
of reports you sent to me for approval.

186
00:12:05.195 --> 00:12:07.864
I heard it's an assault case, and the victim isn't seeking punishment.

187
00:12:07.864 --> 00:12:10.664
It's an obvious case. Aren't you spending too much time on it?

188
00:12:11.695 --> 00:12:12.764
I can't trust the medical report,

189
00:12:12.764 --> 00:12:14.804
and he may have been assaulting her habitually.

190
00:12:17.105 --> 00:12:19.204
Are you sure it's not because it's Lawyer Lee Yu Beom's case?

191
00:12:24.414 --> 00:12:25.514
No, that's not the reason.

192
00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:30.184
Then just submit the report and focus on other cases.

193
00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:34.284
This is why the cold cases keep piling up.

194
00:12:36.224 --> 00:12:38.295
I'll dig a bit deeper and see if I can find anything else.

195
00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:41.125
There are other cases that are more urgent.

196
00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:43.235
Why are you so hung up on that specific case?

197
00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:44.534
If you keep acting like this,

198
00:12:44.594 --> 00:12:47.135
it'll look like you're trying to get back at Lawyer Lee like he said.

199
00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:48.405
I can't do that?

200
00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:50.775
- What? - Whether that's true or not,

201
00:12:50.775 --> 00:12:53.005
there's nothing wrong with wanting to examine a case thoroughly.

202
00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:56.074
Are you joking with me now or what?

203
00:12:56.074 --> 00:12:58.175
I don't care even if you misunderstand my intentions.

204
00:12:58.585 --> 00:13:00.644
If I drop the case just to avoid such a misunderstanding,

205
00:13:00.715 --> 00:13:03.085
it'll come back as a crueler case later on.

206
00:13:03.514 --> 00:13:07.085
So, I plan to look into everything including all past incidents...

207
00:13:07.255 --> 00:13:09.554
very thoroughly.

208
00:13:10.355 --> 00:13:11.525
How dare you!

209
00:13:15.235 --> 00:13:17.994
Goodness. Apparently, Mr. Park yelled at him.

210
00:13:18.505 --> 00:13:20.304
"How dare you!"

211
00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:23.105
Gosh, it takes a lot for him to say that.

212
00:13:23.105 --> 00:13:26.105
"How dare you!" He rarely says it.

213
00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:31.445
I guess the newbie's motto is living an intense...

214
00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:32.815
but short life.

215
00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:37.085
Apparently, he kept talking back to Mr. Park.

216
00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:42.394
He's brave!

217
00:13:42.394 --> 00:13:44.655
He lives today as if there's no tomorrow!

218
00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:48.965
I used to get punched when I talked back.

219
00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:54.534
I guess he can't hold back what he wants to say.

220
00:13:54.864 --> 00:13:56.135
Was he like that in college too?

221
00:13:56.905 --> 00:13:59.574
Not at all. Why is he being so gutsy?

222
00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:02.474
Did he win the lottery or what?

223
00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:18.565
How does it feel?

224
00:14:18.594 --> 00:14:19.925
Isn't this model so amazing?

225
00:14:20.224 --> 00:14:23.034
It's one of the most fuel-efficient luxury sedans.

226
00:14:23.034 --> 00:14:25.764
A whiff of gas is all it needs to start moving.

227
00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:28.304
That's technology. It's our brand's exclusive technology.

228
00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:30.175
Could you please take a picture of me driving?

229
00:14:30.175 --> 00:14:31.704
Of course! Sure thing.

230
00:14:34.704 --> 00:14:36.045
Oh, my. That looks great.

231
00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:38.784
Is it because of the red interiors?

232
00:14:38.784 --> 00:14:41.614
It's perfect for a young CEO.

233
00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:43.054
A young CEO.

234
00:14:43.614 --> 00:14:46.324
What would be good as a second car if I get this as my main car?

235
00:14:46.425 --> 00:14:47.755
A second car?

236
00:14:49.195 --> 00:14:50.425
My gosh.

237
00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:55.394
That's right. The latest trend is getting another car for leisure...

238
00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.494
in addition to the main one you use for work. Absolutely.

239
00:14:57.494 --> 00:14:59.635
It's certainly not an unnecessary luxury.

240
00:14:59.635 --> 00:15:01.405
- Just a moment, please. - Sure.

241
00:15:06.429 --> 00:15:09.661
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E06 While You Were Sleeping "Secretly, Greatly"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

242
00:15:15.385 --> 00:15:16.485
Where are you going?

243
00:15:16.784 --> 00:15:18.655
It's none of your business. Why do you ask?

244
00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.324
There's something I want to tell you.

245
00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:24.994
I told my boss that I plan to re-investigate the case.

246
00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:27.465
I'll be sure to bring the truth to light, no matter what anyone says.

247
00:15:27.664 --> 00:15:28.764
Seriously?

248
00:15:30.695 --> 00:15:33.905
Why were you being so difficult if you were going to do it anyway?

249
00:15:34.065 --> 00:15:36.605
Do your actions and words generally not match?

250
00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.275
- Are you two-faced? - No.

251
00:15:38.275 --> 00:15:39.775
I'd say I'm a man of my word.

252
00:15:39.775 --> 00:15:41.244
It doesn't seem that way.

253
00:15:42.144 --> 00:15:43.545
By the way, whose car is that?

254
00:15:44.114 --> 00:15:45.614
Oh, I'm test-driving it.

255
00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:49.414
Are you going to buy that car?

256
00:15:49.985 --> 00:15:51.085
Well, I'll see.

257
00:15:51.585 --> 00:15:54.585
Are you getting it because you believed my lie...

258
00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:56.355
about the winning lottery number?

259
00:15:57.824 --> 00:16:00.425
What? That was a lie?

260
00:16:02.264 --> 00:16:03.465
Did you actually believe it?

261
00:16:04.664 --> 00:16:07.835
Goodness, do you think I'm crazy? Why would I believe such nonsense?

262
00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:08.835
Right?

263
00:16:09.474 --> 00:16:10.875
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

264
00:16:11.204 --> 00:16:13.605
That's not why you spoke up against your boss, right?

265
00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:18.375
I already told you. I'm not the type of person who bites his tongue...

266
00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:20.315
because of money.

267
00:16:21.514 --> 00:16:23.954
Of course I know that you're not like that.

268
00:16:26.025 --> 00:16:27.054
I should get going.

269
00:16:32.695 --> 00:16:34.664
I've been studying the documents,

270
00:16:34.664 --> 00:16:36.465
and it doesn't look like I can let it go.

271
00:16:36.465 --> 00:16:37.465
Hey!

272
00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:39.934
So, I plan to look into everything including all past incidents.

273
00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:41.164
How dare you!

274
00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.074
I must be going crazy.

275
00:16:45.275 --> 00:16:46.375
My gosh.

276
00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:48.304
He wants to buy an additional car,

277
00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:50.114
and he'll get all the options.

278
00:16:51.414 --> 00:16:54.184
Gosh, honey. Calm down, please.

279
00:16:54.184 --> 00:16:55.284
It's not that big of a deal.

280
00:16:56.585 --> 00:17:00.255
Honey, we should get our son a new phone.

281
00:17:00.355 --> 00:17:03.594
No, not a used one. Let's get him a brand new phone. Of course!

282
00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:06.525
I'll call you back later.

283
00:17:06.994 --> 00:17:08.094
I'll speak to you soon.

284
00:17:11.094 --> 00:17:14.835
Sir, I thought hard about what would be best for you.

285
00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:18.235
You said you want a second car. For the additional car,

286
00:17:18.235 --> 00:17:20.244
I think an SUV would be perfect.

287
00:17:20.244 --> 00:17:23.244
That being said, I'd like to recommend this model to you.

288
00:17:23.244 --> 00:17:24.275
What do you think?

289
00:17:25.385 --> 00:17:27.514
Good to know. I'll keep that in mind.

290
00:17:28.454 --> 00:17:31.454
Right, I thought it's a bit too soon...

291
00:17:31.454 --> 00:17:33.855
to talk about getting an additional car.

292
00:17:34.585 --> 00:17:36.655
Then when would you like to purchase this model?

293
00:17:38.054 --> 00:17:40.295
I guess I'll buy it sometime in the future.

294
00:17:40.295 --> 00:17:42.235
I see, sometime in the future.

295
00:17:43.894 --> 00:17:44.894
I'm in trouble.

296
00:17:48.264 --> 00:17:49.735
Let's go back before the rush hour begins.

297
00:17:54.175 --> 00:17:56.315
Yes, I'm telling you. I obviously have more seniority than him,

298
00:17:56.315 --> 00:17:58.914
but he keeps calling me by my first name at work.

299
00:17:59.184 --> 00:18:02.385
He rebelled against Mr. Park as if he's ready to leave this field.

300
00:18:04.014 --> 00:18:06.425
Hey, exactly.

301
00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:09.724
I know this because I worked on one of Park Jun Mo's cases last year.

302
00:18:09.894 --> 00:18:12.324
Being enthusiastic isn't enough to solve such cases...

303
00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:13.625
My gosh!

304
00:18:14.864 --> 00:18:17.795
What's going on, Prosecutor Jung? What are you doing here?

305
00:18:19.304 --> 00:18:21.405
I'm thinking about leaving this field.

306
00:18:27.945 --> 00:18:29.144
Did you hear everything?

307
00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:32.744
Let's talk casually. There's no one else here.

308
00:18:34.014 --> 00:18:35.985
Yes, let's do that. I mean...

309
00:18:37.014 --> 00:18:38.014
All right.

310
00:18:40.525 --> 00:18:43.054
Did you also not indict him when you worked on his case last year?

311
00:18:44.824 --> 00:18:46.025
What happened was...

312
00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:48.494
I'm not here to argue. I'm just asking out of curiosity.

313
00:18:49.034 --> 00:18:51.635
That's right. I didn't indict him.

314
00:18:51.905 --> 00:18:53.804
Sorry, I still sound so formal.

315
00:18:55.034 --> 00:18:57.335
This wouldn't have happened had you indicted him back then.

316
00:18:57.505 --> 00:18:58.505
You don't regret it?

317
00:18:58.675 --> 00:19:02.014
No, I don't. I'd make the same decision even if I were to go back.

318
00:19:02.414 --> 00:19:04.574
- Why is that? - I'm sure you've heard this before.

319
00:19:05.315 --> 00:19:07.414
"We will fight for justice and human rights."

320
00:19:07.844 --> 00:19:11.054
"We will become warm prosecutors who help the weak and underprivileged."

321
00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:12.684
That's the Prosecutors' Oath.

322
00:19:12.755 --> 00:19:15.525
At times, fighting for justice...

323
00:19:15.525 --> 00:19:18.795
and helping the weak can clash.

324
00:19:18.965 --> 00:19:20.425
As in the Park Jun Mo case.

325
00:19:25.204 --> 00:19:26.965
In many domestic abuse cases,

326
00:19:27.434 --> 00:19:29.875
arresting the husband who is the breadwinner results in...

327
00:19:30.175 --> 00:19:32.844
the rest of the family having to struggle to sustain themselves.

328
00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:37.114
His wife writing that statement doesn't mean she forgave him.

329
00:19:37.114 --> 00:19:38.215
We all know that.

330
00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.445
We're only pretending not to know...

331
00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:42.954
because we want his wife to make a choice...

332
00:19:44.014 --> 00:19:47.625
between staying inside the thorny walls...

333
00:19:48.454 --> 00:19:50.494
and braving the thornbush by stepping out of those walls.

334
00:19:52.195 --> 00:19:54.195
People like us who are sitting in a field of pretty flowers...

335
00:19:54.195 --> 00:19:56.664
don't have any right to tell her what to do.

336
00:19:56.664 --> 00:19:59.804
You want to indict and arrest him without such rights?

337
00:20:01.364 --> 00:20:02.375
That's...

338
00:20:03.474 --> 00:20:04.605
not justice.

339
00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:07.405
It's foolish bravery.

340
00:20:17.315 --> 00:20:19.255
(Seoul Hangang District Prosecutors' Office)

341
00:20:19.255 --> 00:20:22.925
Those who can't differentiate the two shouldn't be prosecutors.

342
00:20:32.704 --> 00:20:35.335
(Jung Jae Chan, Supreme Prosecutors' Office)

343
00:20:35.775 --> 00:20:38.275
(Seoul Hangang District Prosecutors' Office)

344
00:20:51.454 --> 00:20:53.425
Stop chuckling. Why wouldn't you tell me?

345
00:20:53.855 --> 00:20:55.954
What did you mean by starting at a level higher than Grade Nine?

346
00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:59.625
It means that you have to pass the bar exam.

347
00:21:00.594 --> 00:21:01.994
I'll do it.

348
00:21:02.335 --> 00:21:04.735
What can I become if I pass the bar exam?

349
00:21:04.735 --> 00:21:07.065
Gosh, you can become many things.

350
00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:10.175
Many jobs will become available to you, but I'm not sure.

351
00:21:10.175 --> 00:21:11.275
Hello.

352
00:21:19.744 --> 00:21:21.284
Dad, so what is it?

353
00:21:21.344 --> 00:21:23.155
What do you want me to become?

354
00:21:26.824 --> 00:21:29.125
Oh, Jae Chan.

355
00:21:29.994 --> 00:21:32.164
Can you go home and bring my phone?

356
00:21:32.164 --> 00:21:33.465
I forgot to bring it.

357
00:21:33.664 --> 00:21:34.664
Sure.

358
00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:36.635
Jae Chan.

359
00:21:40.235 --> 00:21:41.505
How about a prosecutor?

360
00:21:41.905 --> 00:21:43.005
Prosecutor?

361
00:21:43.304 --> 00:21:44.405
Yes.

362
00:21:44.675 --> 00:21:47.775
I'd love to see you becoming a prosecutor.

363
00:21:48.914 --> 00:21:51.545
Sure, I'll try.

364
00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:52.945
All right.

365
00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.114
You can do it!

366
00:23:29.744 --> 00:23:30.744
Dad.

367
00:23:33.985 --> 00:23:35.085
Dad.

368
00:23:39.684 --> 00:23:42.525
No... Dad.

369
00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:47.824
Dad...

370
00:23:53.405 --> 00:23:54.565
That's when I learned...

371
00:23:55.275 --> 00:23:57.034
that my dad made a choice.

372
00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:00.175
I'm at the funeral...

373
00:24:00.175 --> 00:24:03.045
of Captain Jung Il Song and the bus driver,

374
00:24:03.045 --> 00:24:06.614
Nam Chul Du, who saved lives from the runaway soldier.

375
00:24:08.885 --> 00:24:09.885
No, honey...

376
00:24:09.885 --> 00:24:12.554
Dad sacrificed his life in order to save people,

377
00:24:13.125 --> 00:24:16.025
and the world called him a hero.

378
00:24:18.094 --> 00:24:19.125
But...

379
00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:22.164
my mom lost her husband because of that choice,

380
00:24:22.764 --> 00:24:24.664
and Seung Won and I lost our dad.

381
00:24:25.905 --> 00:24:27.364
I can't really say...

382
00:24:27.864 --> 00:24:30.775
that his choice made me proud. Rather, I resented it.

383
00:24:31.474 --> 00:24:32.945
- Honey... - Dad...

384
00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:35.744
To others, his choice meant justice.

385
00:24:36.974 --> 00:24:38.715
But to me, it was nothing but a foolish bravery.

386
00:24:41.144 --> 00:24:42.485
Honey...

387
00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:56.664
- Can I help you? - Oh, my goodness.

388
00:24:57.394 --> 00:24:59.034
Gosh, I didn't believe my eyes.

389
00:24:59.364 --> 00:25:00.405
What are you talking about?

390
00:25:01.434 --> 00:25:02.934
Don't you remember me?

391
00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:05.005
I'm the guy who almost got hit by the car on Valentine's Day.

392
00:25:06.175 --> 00:25:07.304
Are you all right?

393
00:25:08.474 --> 00:25:09.474
Yes.

394
00:25:10.844 --> 00:25:12.784
Oh, you're that guy.

395
00:25:13.684 --> 00:25:16.454
I should've thanked you sooner. I'm Han Woo Tak.

396
00:25:17.385 --> 00:25:19.485
It's all right. I'm Jung Jae Chan.

397
00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:21.255
You're a prosecutor.

398
00:25:21.255 --> 00:25:22.994
Oh, yes. I work here.

399
00:25:24.295 --> 00:25:25.565
Did you get hurt at all?

400
00:25:25.565 --> 00:25:27.465
Of course not. Thanks to you, I'm totally fine.

401
00:25:27.594 --> 00:25:30.235
I've been wanting to treat you to a meal. I'm so glad I ran into you.

402
00:25:31.164 --> 00:25:33.965
How about we have dinner together this evening? Do you have plans?

403
00:25:35.704 --> 00:25:36.704
No, I don't.

404
00:25:36.704 --> 00:25:37.735
Then let's go.

405
00:25:38.405 --> 00:25:39.445
I'll treat you to barbecue.

406
00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:40.844
All right, sure.

407
00:25:44.844 --> 00:25:46.014
I was born in the Year of the Dragon.

408
00:25:46.114 --> 00:25:47.385
We're the same age, then.

409
00:25:47.945 --> 00:25:50.914
My gosh, seriously? Then shall we talk casually like friends?

410
00:25:50.914 --> 00:25:51.985
I don't want to.

411
00:25:53.284 --> 00:25:54.284
Gosh.

412
00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:57.525
(Hong Joo Samgyeopsal)

413
00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:01.195
Hey, I don't need your help. Just go study.

414
00:26:01.224 --> 00:26:02.635
I'm not doing this to help you.

415
00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:06.105
I'm just bored. I can't stand being bored.

416
00:26:06.105 --> 00:26:08.364
You're really something.

417
00:26:08.574 --> 00:26:11.605
Just like somebody I know, you say one thing and mean another.

418
00:26:11.605 --> 00:26:13.875
You put up a tough front, but you're not strong at all.

419
00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:16.914
You seem like a nice girl, yet you say such mean things.

420
00:26:18.844 --> 00:26:21.385
Ma'am, she's a pianist.

421
00:26:21.385 --> 00:26:23.454
You can't make her do things that might hurt her hands.

422
00:26:29.355 --> 00:26:31.894
Ma'am? Who? Where?

423
00:26:34.164 --> 00:26:36.065
My, what a coincidence.

424
00:26:36.295 --> 00:26:37.494
We meet again.

425
00:26:37.494 --> 00:26:38.534
What a nice surprise.

426
00:26:39.704 --> 00:26:42.505
I gave her a ride home in my police car a few days ago.

427
00:26:42.635 --> 00:26:45.675
I only came here because I was craving pork belly suddenly.

428
00:26:45.675 --> 00:26:47.905
Gosh, how can a coincidence like this happen?

429
00:26:48.204 --> 00:26:50.775
Oh, I totally regretted not asking your name that day.

430
00:26:51.914 --> 00:26:52.914
What's your name?

431
00:26:54.284 --> 00:26:55.554
I'm Nam Hong Joo.

432
00:26:55.684 --> 00:26:57.684
I'm Han Woo Tak. I was born in 1988, the Year of the Dragon.

433
00:26:58.454 --> 00:26:59.855
I was born in the same year.

434
00:26:59.855 --> 00:27:01.585
Then shall we just talk casually like friends?

435
00:27:01.585 --> 00:27:03.094
- Sounds good! - Great.

436
00:27:03.094 --> 00:27:05.364
It's so nice to be able to talk comfortably to an age-mate.

437
00:27:06.764 --> 00:27:09.565
Hold on, that means all three of us are dragons.

438
00:27:09.664 --> 00:27:11.635
We're like three flying dragons.

439
00:27:11.695 --> 00:27:13.465
What? Three flying dragons?

440
00:27:13.864 --> 00:27:15.434
That's so funny!

441
00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:20.505
By the way, you look much better without glasses.

442
00:27:21.244 --> 00:27:22.775
Really? You think so?

443
00:27:24.914 --> 00:27:25.914
Goodness.

444
00:27:30.614 --> 00:27:33.255
I found out where Mr. Park Jun Mo's wife and daughter are staying.

445
00:27:35.224 --> 00:27:36.224
Where are they?

446
00:27:44.664 --> 00:27:47.164
I clearly told you not to get involved with So Yoon.

447
00:27:47.304 --> 00:27:49.635
What are you doing here? And why are you wearing that apron?

448
00:27:51.375 --> 00:27:52.945
That's what I want to ask you.

449
00:27:54.675 --> 00:27:56.215
Gosh, that brat.

450
00:27:56.545 --> 00:27:59.445
I thought the two of you would be very loving towards each other,

451
00:28:00.244 --> 00:28:01.385
but you're just like other brothers.

452
00:28:01.385 --> 00:28:03.155
You even know that he's my brother?

453
00:28:05.985 --> 00:28:07.054
It wasn't a coincidence, right?

454
00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:09.324
Everything from running into me and bringing me here.

455
00:28:09.324 --> 00:28:10.855
That's what I want to know as well.

456
00:28:11.324 --> 00:28:12.795
Is all of this a coincidence?

457
00:28:14.465 --> 00:28:15.835
Or is it fate?

458
00:28:16.034 --> 00:28:17.994
Gosh, what are you doing now?

459
00:28:18.565 --> 00:28:20.735
I actually don't feel anything.

460
00:28:22.135 --> 00:28:23.304
Does it mean it's not fate?

461
00:28:26.005 --> 00:28:28.204
- Where are you going? - I'm going to the washroom.

462
00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:33.885
Will what I saw in my dream really happen?

463
00:28:34.514 --> 00:28:35.614
In the dream...

464
00:28:35.755 --> 00:28:37.114
- Hello. - On my way...

465
00:28:37.114 --> 00:28:38.585
to this restaurant with Kyung Han,

466
00:28:38.684 --> 00:28:40.755
- I ran into Jae Chan. - I'm Oh Kyung Han.

467
00:28:40.755 --> 00:28:43.755
In the dream, we parted ways after exchanging names,

468
00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:45.994
and I came here with Kyung Han.

469
00:28:47.994 --> 00:28:49.295
The rest is the same as the dream.

470
00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.565
From where the customers are sitting...

471
00:28:52.135 --> 00:28:54.965
to what they ordered, everything is exactly the same.

472
00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:57.934
I only made...

473
00:28:58.335 --> 00:28:59.875
a very small change.

474
00:29:01.445 --> 00:29:02.445
Instead of Kyung Han...

475
00:29:02.445 --> 00:29:03.644
Even water is tasty here.

476
00:29:03.644 --> 00:29:04.914
I brought Jae Chan here.

477
00:29:04.914 --> 00:29:05.985
I'm so excited.

478
00:29:09.885 --> 00:29:12.125
Stop joking around and be honest with me.

479
00:29:12.284 --> 00:29:15.795
Is all of this a coincidence or did you bring me here on purpose?

480
00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:18.394
You better not give me the spiel about fate.

481
00:29:18.394 --> 00:29:19.394
Hold on.

482
00:29:19.795 --> 00:29:22.164
Oh, 2 kimchi stew for Table 3.

483
00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:23.494
Okay.

484
00:29:26.204 --> 00:29:27.304
If this is like my dream,

485
00:29:27.835 --> 00:29:30.135
that man will walk in through that door in five seconds.

486
00:29:33.644 --> 00:29:34.744
Five.

487
00:29:34.945 --> 00:29:36.014
Four.

488
00:29:36.545 --> 00:29:37.545
Three.

489
00:29:38.144 --> 00:29:40.215
2, 1.

490
00:29:42.014 --> 00:29:43.414
Hello.

491
00:29:54.065 --> 00:29:55.695
What brings you here, Yu Beom?

492
00:29:56.295 --> 00:29:58.135
Gosh, it's really happening.

493
00:29:58.965 --> 00:30:00.704
He got here in exactly five seconds.

494
00:30:01.775 --> 00:30:03.675
I'm not here to see you, Hong Joo.

495
00:30:07.074 --> 00:30:10.144
I'm here to speak with the two of you as Mr. Park's attorney.

496
00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:21.054
I've seen enough to know that this must be fate, not a coincidence.

497
00:30:22.454 --> 00:30:23.724
You know that man well, don't you?

498
00:30:27.094 --> 00:30:28.295
I'm getting really curious.

499
00:30:28.864 --> 00:30:31.065
That small change I made.

500
00:30:32.434 --> 00:30:33.605
Will it...

501
00:30:34.704 --> 00:30:36.934
prevent the horrible moments...

502
00:30:38.235 --> 00:30:39.675
that are about to unfold?
