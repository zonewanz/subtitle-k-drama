WEBVTT

1
00:00:05.992 --> 00:00:09.129
(Fall visits Running Man.)

2
00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.031
(What is the race of the day that will unfold at a hanok cafe?)

3
00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:13.967
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.736
- Hello. - Hello.

5
00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:21.007
Due to the result of Half and Half Tour Race,

6
00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:24.010
it was decided that Kwang Soo will go to Cage of Death.

7
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.011
That's right.

8
00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:27.113
(Kwang Soo, the expert of penalties...)

9
00:00:27.113 --> 00:00:29.983
(gave a grand finale to the 3rd Global Project.)

10
00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:32.619
(He will receive all 3 penalties of Global Project.)

11
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.488
(This time, he will swim with crocodiles in a cage.)

12
00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:37.190
(Choose a member who will go with you.)

13
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.025
(Let's go with me, Kwang Soo.)

14
00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:40.860
(Give me another week to decide.)

15
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.198
(Kwang Soo postponed choosing a member who will go with him.)

16
00:00:45.198 --> 00:00:48.134
We prepared your last chance to avoid getting chosen,

17
00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:49.703
Half and Half Tour Pass Race.

18
00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:51.271
(It's to decide Kwang Soo's partner.)

19
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:55.108
(It's their last chance to avoid getting chosen.)

20
00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:58.611
A member who acquires Half and Half Tour Pass...

21
00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:00.613
will be exempt from Kwang Soo's choice.

22
00:01:00.613 --> 00:01:01.881
- Really? - Okay.

23
00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:04.217
The members who fail to acquire Half and Half Tour Pass...

24
00:01:04.217 --> 00:01:06.252
will become the candidates Kwang Soo can choose from.

25
00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:09.756
He could be a cool man and go by himself.

26
00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:11.725
(There is no reason to do this.)

27
00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:13.426
I will keep every word you say in mind.

28
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.928
I haven't made my choice yet.

29
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:17.831
Some people say that, but I disagree.

30
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:19.165
- I almost misunderstood. - That's right.

31
00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:20.433
Please do me a favor.

32
00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:21.434
(He makes a sudden request.)

33
00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:22.469
Take me with you.

34
00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:25.138
You should go with Jong Kook.

35
00:01:25.138 --> 00:01:27.474
- Take the person who wants to go. - That's right.

36
00:01:27.574 --> 00:01:30.310
If the glass breaks and the crocodiles attack,

37
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.978
I will protect you.

38
00:01:31.978 --> 00:01:34.414
You are scarier than the crocodiles.

39
00:01:34.414 --> 00:01:36.483
(Crocodiles, please stop Jong Kook.)

40
00:01:36.483 --> 00:01:38.284
- Seriously. - You stress me out.

41
00:01:38.284 --> 00:01:40.420
He can rip the jaw of a crocodile.

42
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.222
I can rip it. Give me a chance.

43
00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:43.923
Here is a thing about the cowards.

44
00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:46.860
A coward can only depend on another coward.

45
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.495
- Then the other one can sympathize. - A brave person won't help.

46
00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:49.529
Of course.

47
00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:51.564
I would rather go with my father than with Jong Kook.

48
00:01:51.564 --> 00:01:54.000
(I would rather go with my father than with Jong Kook.)

49
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.802
- Is your father a coward? - My father and I will go...

50
00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:57.937
- into the glass cage. - Is your father a coward?

51
00:01:58.104 --> 00:02:01.674
It's rare for a son to reveal that his father is a coward.

52
00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:03.176
- That's incredible. - He exposed his father.

53
00:02:03.176 --> 00:02:04.310
That's how desperate I am.

54
00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:07.781
- I want to go too, Kwang Soo. - Ji Hyo.

55
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:09.682
This gives me the creeps.

56
00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:11.718
Why do you say that? I only said...

57
00:02:11.718 --> 00:02:13.920
- I want to go. - This gives me the creeps.

58
00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:16.956
You know it's terribly boring to team up with them.

59
00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:18.458
- That's right. - They are good at everything.

60
00:02:18.658 --> 00:02:20.860
Then I will sit inside the cage without anything to do.

61
00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:22.796
"Look at those crocodiles!"

62
00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:25.231
(It's Cage of Death even without the crocodiles.)

63
00:02:25.632 --> 00:02:28.234
Since Kwang Soo is worried,

64
00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:32.739
we've two guests who will help him with Half and Half Tour Pass Race.

65
00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.208
- Half and Half Tour Pass Race. - Are there guests?

66
00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:36.209
You should go with the guests.

67
00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.647
(Who are the guests of the day?)

68
00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:42.148
Bo Mi and Sung Rok.

69
00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:45.051
- It's Bo Mi. - It's Bo Mi.

70
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:46.920
(They are a treat to her eyes.)

71
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.923
- My goodness. - It's Bo Mi.

72
00:02:49.923 --> 00:02:51.958
- Hello, it has been a while. - Bo Mi.

73
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:53.860
She is like a family since she visits very often.

74
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.861
She is like a family.

75
00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:57.730
Sung Rok and Bo Mi are here.

76
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.965
(They are here to aid Kwang Soo in choosing his partner.)

77
00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:00.800
He's almost tall as you.

78
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.935
- Bo Mi. - Yes?

79
00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:03.703
- Hello. - Have you been well?

80
00:03:04.037 --> 00:03:05.405
Bo Mi, there used to be romance between us.

81
00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:06.406
- That's right. - When was there such a thing?

82
00:03:06.406 --> 00:03:09.375
(Do you remember the last time you were on Running Man?)

83
00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:10.977
(In a bus number 362,)

84
00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:13.346
(they had a match of holding hands.)

85
00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:19.185
(Bo Mi, this is just a game.)

86
00:03:19.185 --> 00:03:20.420
(Grinning)

87
00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:27.861
(Like a rain shower in summer,)

88
00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:31.364
(strange romance formed between Kwang Soo and Bo Mi.)

89
00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:34.467
(It has been a while. How have you been?)

90
00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:37.270
He told me that he will buy me a present from Japan.

91
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.172
(That's right.)

92
00:03:39.172 --> 00:03:40.406
- Really? - Yes.

93
00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:42.876
- Did he contact you afterwards? - He is shameless.

94
00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:45.612
He video calls me when he is drunk.

95
00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:47.614
(There is another thing.)

96
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:49.215
What?

97
00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:51.117
What are you talking about? I didn't do that.

98
00:03:51.117 --> 00:03:52.986
- Kwang Soo. - I didn't do that.

99
00:03:52.986 --> 00:03:54.754
Don't speak nonsense. What are you talking about?

100
00:03:54.754 --> 00:03:56.656
- Don't do that. - You really need to stop.

101
00:03:57.156 --> 00:03:58.758
Did you try to flirt with her?

102
00:03:58.892 --> 00:04:01.127
Bo Mi, it's a problem he has. Please understand.

103
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:02.729
He is ridiculous.

104
00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.732
It wasn't like that. I think of her as a little sister.

105
00:04:05.732 --> 00:04:08.968
Then why would you video call her?

106
00:04:08.968 --> 00:04:10.436
I called with my own phone.

107
00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:14.474
That's true. He's right about that.

108
00:04:14.474 --> 00:04:17.710
- After the shoot last time... - Isn't it awkward to meet here?

109
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.212
I didn't know she would revisit so soon.

110
00:04:19.212 --> 00:04:21.281
(He resents the production crew.)

111
00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:23.950
- Hey. - I didn't know.

112
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.585
You shouldn't have video called her.

113
00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:29.222
Bo Mi, you should let him know if you aren't interested.

114
00:04:29.222 --> 00:04:32.592
- Make it clear. - I already made it clear.

115
00:04:32.592 --> 00:04:33.593
(Bo Mi is firm.)

116
00:04:33.593 --> 00:04:36.396
Really? What did you say to him?

117
00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:37.964
- She already made it clear. - What did you say to him?

118
00:04:37.964 --> 00:04:39.032
- Let me tell you honestly. - Okay.

119
00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:42.669
I wasn't making a move on Bo Mi, but she suddenly rejected me.

120
00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.971
I am serious. I am being honest.

121
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:47.273
- Did she suddenly reject you? - I thought she was a good friend.

122
00:04:47.273 --> 00:04:51.210
I kept in touch with her since I thought of her as a friend.

123
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.913
- Okay. - Then texted me one night,

124
00:04:54.714 --> 00:04:56.583
"You are making me uncomfortable."

125
00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:58.217
I was so surprised.

126
00:04:58.217 --> 00:04:59.786
- She was getting ahead of herself. - I was so surprised.

127
00:04:59.786 --> 00:05:01.955
- It's not like that. - Did you get ahead of yourself?

128
00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:03.022
I bet Kwang Soo thought, "I haven't even started yet."

129
00:05:03.022 --> 00:05:06.726
I texted her, "Bo Mi, I wasn't making a move on you."

130
00:05:07.293 --> 00:05:10.296
"I am glad." That's how the conversation ended.

131
00:05:10.296 --> 00:05:12.665
Sung Rok, I am sorry that this is "Kwang Soo's Love Game".

132
00:05:12.665 --> 00:05:14.033
I am sorry.

133
00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:15.401
I shouldn't have come.

134
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:16.803
- Don't say that. - I am sorry.

135
00:05:16.803 --> 00:05:18.271
- Your time will come. - I had to tell this story.

136
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:21.040
- Will it come? - He looks like a sad dog.

137
00:05:21.474 --> 00:05:23.910
- Why would you say that? - One of the Kakao friends.

138
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.045
His facial expression is similar to that of a character.

139
00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:29.482
Sung Rok, you are in a musical.

140
00:05:29.482 --> 00:05:30.850
He is a musical actor.

141
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.586
I heard it's a musical that is based on "Sandglass".

142
00:05:33.586 --> 00:05:35.588
- Yes. - He plays Choi Min Soo's role.

143
00:05:36.155 --> 00:05:38.024
"I thought doing this would let me have you."

144
00:05:38.024 --> 00:05:40.593
(Everyone remembers Choi Min Soo from "Sandglass".)

145
00:05:40.593 --> 00:05:44.731
(Sung Rok has a role of Park Tae Soo in the newest production.)

146
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:46.399
He has a similar face.

147
00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.334
- That's right. - He is very tall.

148
00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:49.469
How tall are you?

149
00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:51.971
I am 189cm tall.

150
00:05:52.538 --> 00:05:55.475
Despite the similar height, he seems different from Kwang Soo.

151
00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:56.943
- How tall are you? - The proportions matter.

152
00:05:56.943 --> 00:05:58.978
- I hate it when tall people visit. - Kwang Soo has a long face.

153
00:05:58.978 --> 00:06:01.347
- That's right. - Kwang Soo has a long face.

154
00:06:01.514 --> 00:06:04.784
Sung Rok's shoulders are broad too.

155
00:06:04.784 --> 00:06:06.552
- He has nice hips too. - He must work out.

156
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.522
We have two guests today.

157
00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:12.158
Before we go over the rules,

158
00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:15.395
we will show you a video we prepared.

159
00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:16.529
(A video?)

160
00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:17.597
Is there another video?

161
00:06:17.597 --> 00:06:19.832
They prepare a lot of videos.

162
00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:21.334
Is it a video on a hint?

163
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.271
(Few days ago in SBS, Mok-dong)

164
00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:26.906
- What? - What's this?

165
00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:31.344
Plus one to be penalized in Australia.

166
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:33.513
- Is that you again? - Again?

167
00:06:33.513 --> 00:06:36.349
What's the big deal about taking one more person?

168
00:06:37.517 --> 00:06:38.718
It's time...

169
00:06:39.052 --> 00:06:40.253
to make a decision.

170
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.522
I don't know whom I'll take.

171
00:06:43.456 --> 00:06:45.458
Didn't you want to go with Jae Seok?

172
00:06:46.092 --> 00:06:48.961
Shouldn't you take Jong Kook?

173
00:06:49.162 --> 00:06:50.229
Is that a writer?

174
00:06:51.264 --> 00:06:54.100
Everyone is a strong candidate.

175
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.902
For example,

176
00:06:55.902 --> 00:06:58.037
Ji Hyo hasn't been penalized yet.

177
00:06:58.037 --> 00:07:00.540
I don't remember the last time that she was.

178
00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:02.775
I don't think she was for seven years.

179
00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:04.544
What about So Min?

180
00:07:04.544 --> 00:07:07.714
The reason why I'm here is So Min.

181
00:07:07.847 --> 00:07:11.150
If So Min didn't distract me that day,

182
00:07:11.284 --> 00:07:12.785
there wouldn't have been a problem.

183
00:07:13.352 --> 00:07:16.656
So Min was penalized not so long ago. What about Haha?

184
00:07:16.656 --> 00:07:18.958
Haha and Se Chan will go to New Zealand.

185
00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.895
It'd be perfect if they stop in Australia on the way back.

186
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:24.664
- I agree. - That's perfect.

187
00:07:24.664 --> 00:07:25.898
That sounds good.

188
00:07:25.898 --> 00:07:27.166
(Who keeps giving Kwang Soo advice?)

189
00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:30.536
It's not easy to decide.

190
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.904
Today...

191
00:07:32.605 --> 00:07:33.673
No matter what,

192
00:07:33.906 --> 00:07:38.044
I'll follow what the assistants say.

193
00:07:40.146 --> 00:07:42.482
(I'll follow what the assistants say.)

194
00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:43.783
- Assistants? - Assistants?

195
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.351
- Assistants? - Assistants?

196
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:47.086
They must be the assistants.

197
00:07:47.086 --> 00:07:48.221
- Really? - No.

198
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:49.522
I don't think so.

199
00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:51.457
Are they the assistants?

200
00:07:51.457 --> 00:07:53.893
As you saw on the video,

201
00:07:54.527 --> 00:07:58.664
there are assistants among you who will help Kwang Soo decide.

202
00:07:58.664 --> 00:08:00.967
(There are assistants among the 10 members.)

203
00:08:02.902 --> 00:08:04.470
As you saw on the video...

204
00:08:04.837 --> 00:08:08.841
(Unidentified assistants who help Kwang Soo decide)

205
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:10.910
(While hiding their identity,)

206
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.146
(the assistants will help Kwang Soo decide.)

207
00:08:13.846 --> 00:08:15.581
That's why So Min has been quiet.

208
00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:17.517
(That's why So Min has been quiet.)

209
00:08:17.517 --> 00:08:19.652
Stop it, Haha.

210
00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:23.289
- Why is it always me? - She was with Kwang Soo.

211
00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:25.725
- Right. - It's neither Bo Mi nor Sung Rok?

212
00:08:25.725 --> 00:08:26.993
- I don't think so. - Listen.

213
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.663
You get a video clip hint when you clear a mission.

214
00:08:30.897 --> 00:08:33.499
The member who arrests the assistants before the end...

215
00:08:33.499 --> 00:08:36.235
of the race will be exempted from being penalized.

216
00:08:36.235 --> 00:08:37.303
Is that so?

217
00:08:37.537 --> 00:08:40.907
Are we exempted if we arrest the assistants?

218
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.744
If you arrest them, you win an exemption pass.

219
00:08:44.877 --> 00:08:47.547
If all members fail to arrest the assistants,

220
00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:49.916
Kwang Soo and the assistants win.

221
00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:52.251
Kwang Soo may choose two members...

222
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:55.154
- to take to Australia. - Two members?

223
00:08:55.154 --> 00:08:56.756
- Will 3 of us go? - 2 members?

224
00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:58.157
- Why 2? - Will 3 members go?

225
00:08:58.157 --> 00:08:59.992
(Kwang Soo and assistants versus the rest)

226
00:08:59.992 --> 00:09:01.394
I feel much better.

227
00:09:01.394 --> 00:09:04.263
Do the assistants know who they are?

228
00:09:04.263 --> 00:09:05.298
Right.

229
00:09:05.998 --> 00:09:09.535
All answers are in the video clips available if you clear the missions.

230
00:09:09.535 --> 00:09:11.070
(Video clips contain hints.)

231
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.573
- They're in the video clips. - I'm not it.

232
00:09:13.673 --> 00:09:16.943
Please get changed, and we'll start the race.

233
00:09:16.943 --> 00:09:18.010
Let's go.

234
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.046
- Let's go. - We have no hints yet.

235
00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:22.415
- I don't think it's Seok Jin. - It's not me.

236
00:09:22.415 --> 00:09:25.184
He isn't ready to take such a big role.

237
00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:28.521
(Who are Kwang Soo's assistants today?)

238
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.927
Here's the first mission for which you can win a hint.

239
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:37.897
It's called Bell Hide and Seek: Kwang Soo, Let's Play.

240
00:09:37.897 --> 00:09:39.498
(Bell Hide and Seek: Kwang Soo, Let's Play)

241
00:09:41.167 --> 00:09:42.735
Is it Bell Hide and Seek?

242
00:09:42.735 --> 00:09:44.003
It's been a long time.

243
00:09:44.303 --> 00:09:47.673
The time limit is five minutes. As the seeker, Kwang Soo may...

244
00:09:47.673 --> 00:09:51.577
eliminate other members by touching them.

245
00:09:52.278 --> 00:09:54.814
The time limit is five minutes.

246
00:09:54.814 --> 00:09:57.516
As the seeker, Kwang Soo may eliminate...

247
00:09:57.617 --> 00:09:59.552
other members by touching them.

248
00:09:59.552 --> 00:10:01.520
Kwang Soo won't look for Bo Mi today.

249
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.390
(Kwang Soo won't look for Bo Mi today.)

250
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.424
Why not?

251
00:10:05.424 --> 00:10:07.126
- Why? - He can call her on video.

252
00:10:07.126 --> 00:10:08.895
What are you talking about?

253
00:10:08.895 --> 00:10:10.563
What do you mean by video call?

254
00:10:10.563 --> 00:10:12.164
- You can call her. - Wait.

255
00:10:12.398 --> 00:10:14.433
You probably feel awkward, so I'll stand in between.

256
00:10:14.433 --> 00:10:16.235
- What? - Stop it, Jae Seok.

257
00:10:16.302 --> 00:10:18.070
- Don't you feel awkward? - What are you talking about?

258
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.172
- Are you okay? - I don't feel awkward.

259
00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:22.141
- She said, "I don't feel awkward." - Is that so?

260
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:24.644
(Will their romance start again today?)

261
00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:27.213
The other members will put on a bell and hide.

262
00:10:27.413 --> 00:10:29.548
Stay hidden during the time limit...

263
00:10:30.016 --> 00:10:32.018
or run away before being eliminated.

264
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:35.121
(If you touch the stuffed crocodile on the coffee table, you survive.)

265
00:10:35.121 --> 00:10:39.525
If you touch the stuffed crocodile on the coffee table, you survive.

266
00:10:39.525 --> 00:10:40.760
- Stuffed crocodile? - Crocodile?

267
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.029
If Kwang Soo sees someone...

268
00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:45.531
and touches the crocodile after shouting the member's name,

269
00:10:45.531 --> 00:10:47.166
then the member is eliminated.

270
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.768
- If he says the name? - I see.

271
00:10:48.868 --> 00:10:50.002
Once he sees someone?

272
00:10:50.002 --> 00:10:51.904
Do I have to touch it by hand?

273
00:10:51.904 --> 00:10:53.673
May I kick it?

274
00:10:53.673 --> 00:10:55.041
- Isn't that touching? - Yes.

275
00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:57.243
May I defend myself by punching?

276
00:10:57.243 --> 00:10:59.545
(May I defend myself by punching?)

277
00:11:00.212 --> 00:11:02.014
You'd be eliminated by him.

278
00:11:02.014 --> 00:11:03.983
His chin would touch your fist.

279
00:11:03.983 --> 00:11:05.418
- By the way... - I don't care.

280
00:11:06.552 --> 00:11:08.287
- He doesn't care. - I don't.

281
00:11:09.155 --> 00:11:12.425
If I touch someone with a weapon, is that considered touching?

282
00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:13.793
- No. - No?

283
00:11:13.793 --> 00:11:14.827
(That's so funny.)

284
00:11:16.195 --> 00:11:19.198
Since we haven't seen Bo Mi in a while,

285
00:11:19.198 --> 00:11:20.800
let's see her kick.

286
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.867
Shall we?

287
00:11:21.867 --> 00:11:24.136
(Let's see Bo Mi's kick.)

288
00:11:24.136 --> 00:11:26.405
- Her kick? - That's so random.

289
00:11:26.505 --> 00:11:30.276
I had forgotten about it, but I remembered her kick.

290
00:11:31.744 --> 00:11:35.648
(8 years of training make her fierce.)

291
00:11:36.782 --> 00:11:38.918
(According to Seok Jin and Jae Seok,)

292
00:11:38.918 --> 00:11:42.788
(their bruise lasted for a week.)

293
00:11:43.155 --> 00:11:46.926
I had forgotten about it, but I remembered her kick.

294
00:11:46.926 --> 00:11:49.028
- Remember the kick? - All of a sudden?

295
00:11:49.028 --> 00:11:50.896
- Come out, Kwang Soo. - It was sudden.

296
00:11:52.298 --> 00:11:53.799
- Kwang Soo. - Me?

297
00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:55.167
Kick Kwang Soo's leg.

298
00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:57.536
- Come out, Kwang Soo. - That's right.

299
00:11:57.536 --> 00:11:59.772
- Me? - Kick Kwang Soo's leg.

300
00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:00.906
Me?

301
00:12:01.407 --> 00:12:02.441
Let's see it.

302
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:04.510
You don't need to stretch, Bo Mi.

303
00:12:05.044 --> 00:12:06.412
Why is it me?

304
00:12:06.412 --> 00:12:08.147
Brace yourself. She's strong.

305
00:12:08.147 --> 00:12:09.548
- You might get injured. - He's weak.

306
00:12:09.548 --> 00:12:11.684
If Kwang Soo doesn't fall or make a sound...

307
00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:13.986
once he gets kicked, we'll give you...

308
00:12:13.986 --> 00:12:15.187
30 more seconds to seek.

309
00:12:15.187 --> 00:12:16.288
- 30 seconds? - Really?

310
00:12:16.288 --> 00:12:18.324
- This is worth it. - Okay.

311
00:12:18.324 --> 00:12:20.893
(He'll be given 30 more seconds during Hide and Seek.)

312
00:12:20.893 --> 00:12:23.662
(If he endures the pain,)

313
00:12:23.662 --> 00:12:26.932
(he may stop others from getting the video clip hint.)

314
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.202
(She kicks him hard.)

315
00:12:30.302 --> 00:12:32.238
(My goodness)

316
00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:34.273
(He falls down.)

317
00:12:36.642 --> 00:12:39.412
(Bo Mi's kick impresses everyone.)

318
00:12:40.913 --> 00:12:42.048
Goodness.

319
00:12:42.048 --> 00:12:43.182
I'm sorry.

320
00:12:43.416 --> 00:12:44.650
I thought a giraffe fell down...

321
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.152
- in the savanna. - I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

322
00:12:46.886 --> 00:12:50.022
(He looks like a falling giraffe in the savanna.)

323
00:12:50.423 --> 00:12:52.658
- Seriously. - My goodness.

324
00:12:52.658 --> 00:12:53.926
- Bo Mi. - I'm sorry.

325
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.163
I'm so sorry, Kwang Soo.

326
00:12:57.496 --> 00:12:59.298
Will it be transferred on screen?

327
00:12:59.298 --> 00:13:00.933
- I don't think so. - Seriously.

328
00:13:00.933 --> 00:13:03.002
- Sung Rok... - He looked like...

329
00:13:03.002 --> 00:13:04.637
- laughed at him. - a falling skyscraper.

330
00:13:04.637 --> 00:13:05.871
- Really? - He laughed.

331
00:13:05.871 --> 00:13:07.373
Did you?

332
00:13:07.373 --> 00:13:09.742
He laughed at him.

333
00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:10.910
I saw him.

334
00:13:11.143 --> 00:13:12.945
Be honest.

335
00:13:13.145 --> 00:13:15.147
Do you think that Kwang Soo exaggerated?

336
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:16.282
Tell us honestly.

337
00:13:16.282 --> 00:13:19.418
- He's definitely an entertainer. - I know.

338
00:13:19.552 --> 00:13:20.553
That's what I thought.

339
00:13:20.553 --> 00:13:23.055
It's true that Kwang Soo...

340
00:13:23.055 --> 00:13:25.291
- He exaggerated. - exaggerated.

341
00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:28.794
If Sung Rok endures the pain, he may put on 1 bell instead of 2.

342
00:13:28.794 --> 00:13:29.829
Okay.

343
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:31.363
It's beyond what you imagine.

344
00:13:32.932 --> 00:13:33.999
Okay.

345
00:13:33.999 --> 00:13:36.068
(Bo Mi kicks hard.)

346
00:13:36.068 --> 00:13:39.171
(However, Kwang Soo did exaggerate.)

347
00:13:39.171 --> 00:13:41.874
(Sung Rok's pride is on the line.)

348
00:13:41.941 --> 00:13:43.442
(Screaming)

349
00:13:45.277 --> 00:13:47.780
(His reaction is dramatic.)

350
00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:52.118
(He crawls.)

351
00:13:53.786 --> 00:13:56.155
He looked like a paulownia tree...

352
00:13:56.422 --> 00:13:57.890
My goodness.

353
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.292
He broke into two.

354
00:14:00.493 --> 00:14:01.694
She kicks really hard.

355
00:14:02.027 --> 00:14:04.196
Kwang Soo wasn't acting.

356
00:14:04.363 --> 00:14:05.397
Seriously.

357
00:14:06.132 --> 00:14:07.133
- I'm sorry. - How was it?

358
00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:08.167
Sung Rok.

359
00:14:08.901 --> 00:14:09.902
How hard was it?

360
00:14:09.902 --> 00:14:12.037
- Wait. - He's stumbling. Are you okay?

361
00:14:12.037 --> 00:14:14.240
Wait. My muscles are tense.

362
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.642
She kicked me before. The bruise lasted a week.

363
00:14:16.642 --> 00:14:18.444
- Are you okay? - I'm so sorry.

364
00:14:18.444 --> 00:14:19.945
Let's get started now.

365
00:14:19.945 --> 00:14:21.013
By the way,

366
00:14:21.013 --> 00:14:22.748
has she kicked Jong Kook before?

367
00:14:22.948 --> 00:14:24.383
It's not fun for me.

368
00:14:24.917 --> 00:14:26.185
My goodness.

369
00:14:26.418 --> 00:14:27.486
What do you mean?

370
00:14:27.486 --> 00:14:29.155
It's not fun when he doesn't want to do it.

371
00:14:29.522 --> 00:14:31.157
It's fun when he wants to do it.

372
00:14:31.157 --> 00:14:32.324
- It's not fun. - Hurry up.

373
00:14:32.324 --> 00:14:34.093
Don't live that way.

374
00:14:34.093 --> 00:14:35.394
Why wouldn't it be fun?

375
00:14:35.394 --> 00:14:36.862
- Come on. - Try it.

376
00:14:36.862 --> 00:14:38.364
- It may be funny. - Listen.

377
00:14:38.364 --> 00:14:39.798
- It's not fun. - Let's do this.

378
00:14:39.798 --> 00:14:41.800
- It won't hurt me. - Se Chan, Jong Kook...

379
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.801
and I.

380
00:14:42.801 --> 00:14:44.370
- Include Haha. - Right.

381
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.404
- One of us gets kicked. - Okay.

382
00:14:45.404 --> 00:14:47.006
- Don't exclude Seok Jin. - Jae Seok.

383
00:14:47.006 --> 00:14:49.408
- Seok Jin... - Why would you include us?

384
00:14:49.408 --> 00:14:51.076
She kicked me very hard last time.

385
00:14:51.076 --> 00:14:54.413
We must be included to make Jong Kook participate.

386
00:14:54.413 --> 00:14:55.548
(Make Jong Kook get picked.)

387
00:14:55.548 --> 00:14:56.916
Stop that.

388
00:14:56.916 --> 00:14:59.151
- What am I doing? - Stop it.

389
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:01.754
Is it five of us?

390
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.722
Let's draw straws to pick one person.

391
00:15:04.023 --> 00:15:05.658
Here are five straws.

392
00:15:05.658 --> 00:15:07.526
There's one that says dud.

393
00:15:07.526 --> 00:15:10.896
This is what Sung Rok told me.

394
00:15:11.163 --> 00:15:12.665
"It was real."

395
00:15:14.133 --> 00:15:15.668
We don't act.

396
00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:17.269
- You weren't acting. - You became pale.

397
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.271
- You're sweating too. - It's real.

398
00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:20.673
It really hurts.

399
00:15:22.007 --> 00:15:23.776
Don't look at the straws.

400
00:15:23.943 --> 00:15:25.044
Don't look.

401
00:15:25.744 --> 00:15:27.046
- The rest of you can see it. - One.

402
00:15:27.046 --> 00:15:28.914
- It really hurts. - 1, 2, 3.

403
00:15:28.914 --> 00:15:31.283
(Who will be the unlucky one?)

404
00:15:33.652 --> 00:15:34.653
Let's see.

405
00:15:34.653 --> 00:15:36.188
(Haha gets picked.)

406
00:15:36.188 --> 00:15:37.423
- Now, - She shows no reaction.

407
00:15:37.423 --> 00:15:38.657
fold the paper.

408
00:15:39.158 --> 00:15:40.793
Decide if you'll exchange.

409
00:15:40.793 --> 00:15:42.494
I will keep mine.

410
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:43.896
- Wait a minute. - I'll keep mine.

411
00:15:43.896 --> 00:15:45.264
- Let's exchange. - I won't.

412
00:15:45.264 --> 00:15:46.765
I won't change mine.

413
00:15:46.765 --> 00:15:48.300
- Let's exchange. - No.

414
00:15:48.567 --> 00:15:49.668
Come on.

415
00:15:49.768 --> 00:15:53.906
- Let's exchange. - Okay.

416
00:15:53.906 --> 00:15:56.675
(Haha exchanges his unlucky draw with Seok Jin.)

417
00:15:56.675 --> 00:15:57.776
- Wait a minute. - Did they exchange?

418
00:15:57.776 --> 00:15:59.411
- Why? - I don't know.

419
00:15:59.411 --> 00:16:00.779
- I won't exchange. - Let's exchange.

420
00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:01.880
Who wants to exchange?

421
00:16:02.047 --> 00:16:03.148
For now...

422
00:16:03.148 --> 00:16:04.316
(Singing)

423
00:16:04.316 --> 00:16:06.051
My goodness.

424
00:16:06.285 --> 00:16:08.887
(Will you exchange with mine?)

425
00:16:08.887 --> 00:16:10.422
- What's going on? - It's not me.

426
00:16:10.422 --> 00:16:12.057
This is what everyone does.

427
00:16:12.057 --> 00:16:13.759
- Everyone does this. - It isn't me.

428
00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:15.294
- When Seok Jin offers his straw... - Seok Jin.

429
00:16:15.294 --> 00:16:16.295
(He freezes.)

430
00:16:16.295 --> 00:16:17.463
Is it me?

431
00:16:17.463 --> 00:16:18.864
(They couldn't hide their reaction.)

432
00:16:18.864 --> 00:16:19.932
It's because...

433
00:16:20.132 --> 00:16:21.267
Seriously?

434
00:16:21.667 --> 00:16:23.802
- You're not going to switch, right? - No.

435
00:16:23.802 --> 00:16:24.870
If it's me, I'm...

436
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.272
- 1, 2... - 1.

437
00:16:26.272 --> 00:16:27.906
(Peeking)

438
00:16:27.906 --> 00:16:29.041
Then...

439
00:16:30.776 --> 00:16:32.745
(I see.)

440
00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:33.912
1, 2...

441
00:16:33.912 --> 00:16:35.814
It's just a simple kick. You'll get it...

442
00:16:35.814 --> 00:16:37.549
- like Kwang Soo and Sung Rok. - Right.

443
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.385
- 1, 2, 3. - Wait. We'll switch.

444
00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:41.153
- What? - We'll switch.

445
00:16:41.153 --> 00:16:42.821
What? What is it?

446
00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:44.056
- Let's switch. - Did you see letters?

447
00:16:44.056 --> 00:16:45.424
No, no. I didn't read it yet.

448
00:16:45.424 --> 00:16:47.326
- Should I switch mine with his? - You should give that a try.

449
00:16:47.326 --> 00:16:50.262
I swear. I saw Seok Jin taking a peek.

450
00:16:51.063 --> 00:16:52.197
I did too!

451
00:16:52.398 --> 00:16:53.832
I can bet my whole saving.

452
00:16:55.234 --> 00:16:56.302
(Common action taken by liars being caught in action)

453
00:16:56.302 --> 00:16:57.403
No, I didn't see it!

454
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.238
- I saw him reading it. - It's not me.

455
00:16:59.238 --> 00:17:00.272
- I'll bet my whole saving. - Wait.

456
00:17:00.272 --> 00:17:01.273
- No. - I saw him.

457
00:17:01.273 --> 00:17:03.876
- Why me? She kicked me last time. - Go. I didn't get it, did I?

458
00:17:04.043 --> 00:17:05.311
- Why did I switch mine with you? - It was you, Haha.

459
00:17:05.311 --> 00:17:07.212
- It was supposed to be me. - Let's not do this.

460
00:17:07.479 --> 00:17:09.848
Let's hurry. Let's get it over with and move on. We don't have time.

461
00:17:09.848 --> 00:17:12.017
- You should get the kick too! - Get the kick, and move on.

462
00:17:12.184 --> 00:17:13.986
Get the kick, and put it behind us.

463
00:17:13.986 --> 00:17:16.388
- He wants to get rid of Seok Jin. - Get the kick, and move on.

464
00:17:16.388 --> 00:17:18.791
- Hurry. - As we talked about before,

465
00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:20.793
- he'll get it, and be gone. - We already wasted too much time.

466
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.495
- I'm fine. I can endure the kick. - Watch your hands.

467
00:17:23.495 --> 00:17:25.064
- Face forward. - My thighs can handle her kick.

468
00:17:25.798 --> 00:17:27.333
Let's get rid of him. Let's put him away.

469
00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:29.268
- Goodness. - Put him somewhere else.

470
00:17:29.268 --> 00:17:30.736
(He got the kick and was removed.)

471
00:17:30.736 --> 00:17:35.808
(Even before his pain goes away, he was dragged out.)

472
00:17:35.808 --> 00:17:37.743
- I'm really sorry. - This will do it.

473
00:17:37.743 --> 00:17:39.044
- Let's film. - That's good.

474
00:17:39.778 --> 00:17:41.880
- Let's continue shooting. - Let's start.

475
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.816
- Seok Jin. - Let's film.

476
00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:45.984
- Can we really leave him here? - That's fine, Bo Mi.

477
00:17:46.085 --> 00:17:47.720
He's all right.

478
00:17:48.053 --> 00:17:50.956
It hurts so much! It seriously hurts!

479
00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:54.793
- We respect you. - Respect!

480
00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:56.729
All right.

481
00:17:57.563 --> 00:18:01.200
Only the members who survive in the game will be given the video.

482
00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:03.035
If the tagger eliminates everyone,

483
00:18:03.035 --> 00:18:05.771
- the video won't be given to you. - Really?

484
00:18:05.771 --> 00:18:08.707
- Kwang Soo will enter the house. - Okay.

485
00:18:08.774 --> 00:18:11.543
One of the members outside has to ring the bell.

486
00:18:11.543 --> 00:18:12.778
(1 member must press the bell.)

487
00:18:12.778 --> 00:18:15.614
The member must say, "Let's play, Kwang Soo", ring the bell and hide.

488
00:18:15.614 --> 00:18:17.116
So you may choose the member among yourselves.

489
00:18:17.116 --> 00:18:18.984
The one who will ring the bell is Seok Jin.

490
00:18:18.984 --> 00:18:20.386
(The member is already predestined.)

491
00:18:20.386 --> 00:18:22.221
- Seok Jin will press it. - You're trying to get me.

492
00:18:22.221 --> 00:18:23.222
(He was kicked and dragged out.)

493
00:18:23.922 --> 00:18:25.190
- Seok Jin will press it. - You're trying to get me.

494
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.292
(He will run faster and differently from the others.)

495
00:18:27.292 --> 00:18:29.228
All right. We'll tie the bells on you now.

496
00:18:29.294 --> 00:18:30.696
Kwang Soo, please go inside the house.

497
00:18:30.696 --> 00:18:32.498
(Members put on the bells, and Kwang Soo goes inside the house.)

498
00:18:33.198 --> 00:18:36.435
(This is the stuffed crocodile members and Kwang Soo must touch.)

499
00:18:36.435 --> 00:18:37.703
This is the stuffed crocodile.

500
00:18:40.272 --> 00:18:41.540
Haha took a peek.

501
00:18:43.509 --> 00:18:46.812
I should keep the assistants alive to avert any suspicion.

502
00:18:46.812 --> 00:18:49.948
(I should keep the assistants alive to avert any suspicion.)

503
00:18:51.316 --> 00:18:54.453
The rest of you may hide with your own cameras.

504
00:18:56.054 --> 00:18:57.289
How far can I go?

505
00:18:58.023 --> 00:18:59.792
But isn't this space too small?

506
00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:01.293
(They must make good use of the cafe and the sculptures.)

507
00:19:01.293 --> 00:19:03.262
(Ji Hyo will ring the bell.)

508
00:19:03.929 --> 00:19:05.798
Gosh, I'm horrible at hiding.

509
00:19:07.032 --> 00:19:08.300
Hey, Jae Seok, no. This is my spot.

510
00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:10.803
- Jae Seok. - I was heading there.

511
00:19:11.136 --> 00:19:12.604
This is my strategy.

512
00:19:12.604 --> 00:19:13.772
(This is a popular place among cunning members.)

513
00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:17.476
(It's the space behind the rock which is close to the house.)

514
00:19:17.476 --> 00:19:20.112
Hey, you have to run away well too.

515
00:19:21.947 --> 00:19:23.882
(Jong Kook enters the kitchen of the cafe.)

516
00:19:23.882 --> 00:19:26.318
I can lie down. Is there a blanket or something?

517
00:19:26.318 --> 00:19:28.587
(Behind the refrigerator seems nice, but I need more.)

518
00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:32.524
(He's patient, and puts effort even into the game.)

519
00:19:34.293 --> 00:19:37.463
(Hide well, Jong Kook. Otherwise, your muscles will be spotted.)

520
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.266
(Haha hides behind the house which is an innovative strategy.)

521
00:19:41.266 --> 00:19:42.334
No one will find me here.

522
00:19:42.334 --> 00:19:44.269
You should hide there and film me.

523
00:19:44.703 --> 00:19:47.806
(This genius of hide and seek even commands the cameraman.)

524
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.075
(Jingling)

525
00:19:52.511 --> 00:19:53.679
I guess someone's here.

526
00:19:53.946 --> 00:19:56.281
Darn. You are here.

527
00:19:57.816 --> 00:19:59.351
- Do you want to come? - Are you going to take that space?

528
00:20:00.085 --> 00:20:02.087
- We can hear the sound from there. - We should get out then.

529
00:20:02.087 --> 00:20:04.122
(Haha and Seok Jin hide behind the house together.)

530
00:20:05.257 --> 00:20:07.192
(Where should I hide?)

531
00:20:07.993 --> 00:20:09.628
Stay here. No, you should stay here.

532
00:20:09.828 --> 00:20:11.830
Let me. Let me just stay here for a while.

533
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.565
(As a new, cunning member, she hides among the crew's equipment.)

534
00:20:14.433 --> 00:20:15.567
(Go back to work, please.)

535
00:20:15.567 --> 00:20:17.436
No, stay there. Please you can stay.

536
00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:19.471
(Go back to work, please.)

537
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.674
(This is perfect. I'm satisfied.)

538
00:20:22.674 --> 00:20:23.842
It's perfect.

539
00:20:23.842 --> 00:20:25.077
Thank you, everyone.

540
00:20:25.544 --> 00:20:28.280
Thank you. I love you, all.

541
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.348
(I'll be the audio equipment for 5 minutes.)

542
00:20:30.115 --> 00:20:31.783
10 seconds before the race starts!

543
00:20:32.818 --> 00:20:35.120
(The hint video is at stake on the 1st round of the game.)

544
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.524
(They must touch the crocodile first or not get caught for 5 minutes.)

545
00:20:38.524 --> 00:20:41.126
(If he finds members and touches the crocodile, they're eliminated.)

546
00:20:41.126 --> 00:20:43.061
2, 1.

547
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.332
Kwang Soo, let's play!

548
00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:51.336
- 1, 2, 3, 4... - Kwang Soo, let's play!

549
00:20:51.336 --> 00:20:54.072
(The tagger must count to 10 and start looking for them.)

550
00:20:54.172 --> 00:20:55.541
9, 10.

551
00:20:56.542 --> 00:20:59.244
(The 1st round of Kwang Soo, Let's Play starts.)

552
00:21:00.245 --> 00:21:01.580
(Ji Hyo hides behind the rock swiftly.)

553
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.115
- Hey. - Hold on.

554
00:21:04.082 --> 00:21:07.185
(As soon as she hides, Kwang Soo ventures out.)

555
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.123
(Where did you all hide?)

556
00:21:11.123 --> 00:21:12.524
How can she hide so quickly?

557
00:21:15.928 --> 00:21:18.330
(Bo Mi is hiding behind the stairs.)

558
00:21:19.731 --> 00:21:20.866
The space is so small.

559
00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:22.701
(You did a good job of hiding in this limited space.)

560
00:21:23.635 --> 00:21:28.206
(Please don't come here.)

561
00:21:31.443 --> 00:21:35.614
(He enters the cafe which radiates a suspicious vibe.)

562
00:21:36.481 --> 00:21:40.185
(Sung Rok is hiding right in the center of the cafe.)

563
00:21:40.185 --> 00:21:44.923
(If things go wrong, he might get caught.)

564
00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:47.826
(Rattling)

565
00:21:49.127 --> 00:21:51.330
(Oh, no!)

566
00:21:52.497 --> 00:21:54.032
(I heard a sound from somewhere around here.)

567
00:21:54.032 --> 00:21:55.934
(This is the place Seok Jin and Haha are hiding.)

568
00:21:56.702 --> 00:22:01.573
(The tagger has gotten close. When he turns, they're caught.)

569
00:22:02.975 --> 00:22:04.977
(Feeling nervous)

570
00:22:05.944 --> 00:22:09.615
(Meanwhile, this guy was about to get caught by Kwang Soo.)

571
00:22:09.615 --> 00:22:12.451
(Kwang Soo is occupied searching the back.)

572
00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:16.955
(This is my chance!)

573
00:22:18.957 --> 00:22:21.526
(Sung Rok, let me go with you!)

574
00:22:22.094 --> 00:22:24.563
(Bo Mi who was hiding behind the staircase is running.)

575
00:22:24.563 --> 00:22:26.865
(And Ji Hyo and Se Chan who were behind the rock are running.)

576
00:22:27.532 --> 00:22:28.533
Hurry up, and run.

577
00:22:28.533 --> 00:22:31.003
(This is the chance to touch it without the tagger present.)

578
00:22:35.507 --> 00:22:37.676
(No! My crocodile!)

579
00:22:39.044 --> 00:22:40.312
(Four of them enter the house in order.)

580
00:22:40.312 --> 00:22:41.380
Move aside.

581
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.714
(Four of them enter the house in order.)

582
00:22:44.049 --> 00:22:48.020
(Sung Rok, Bo Mi, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo get to watch the hint video.)

583
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.588
Hey, you idiot.

584
00:22:50.122 --> 00:22:51.323
Four of them touched it?

585
00:22:51.323 --> 00:22:52.924
- Goodness. - I...

586
00:22:52.924 --> 00:22:54.326
- I mean, Kwang Soo... - Four of them got it?

587
00:22:54.326 --> 00:22:56.128
Bo Mi, you are so fast.

588
00:22:56.862 --> 00:22:59.464
Darn. I'm so bad at this.

589
00:22:59.998 --> 00:23:01.133
I am bad at this.

590
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.801
(Members who are still hiding)

591
00:23:02.801 --> 00:23:04.536
Where did they hide? They can't possibly hide here.

592
00:23:04.536 --> 00:23:06.138
(Members who are still hiding)

593
00:23:07.706 --> 00:23:09.941
I can hear the bells. The bells.

594
00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:12.744
(Seok Jin observed how the four members succeeded.)

595
00:23:12.744 --> 00:23:15.280
(Kwang Soo is far from the house, and this is my chance!)

596
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.783
(Seok Jin, the oldie, makes a run for it.)

597
00:23:18.684 --> 00:23:20.686
(In an instant...)

598
00:23:20.686 --> 00:23:24.956
(What just happened?)

599
00:23:24.956 --> 00:23:29.061
(Why is he running so fiercely?)

600
00:23:29.728 --> 00:23:31.830
(Laughing)

601
00:23:33.031 --> 00:23:34.132
(Skipping)

602
00:23:35.534 --> 00:23:36.568
Seok Jin is eliminated!

603
00:23:36.568 --> 00:23:41.073
(Seok Jin gets eliminated easily.)

604
00:23:41.306 --> 00:23:42.674
I saw that coming, Seok Jin.

605
00:23:43.542 --> 00:23:45.343
He was walking, not running.

606
00:23:47.345 --> 00:23:49.214
I felt so bad when I touched the crocodile.

607
00:23:49.214 --> 00:23:51.249
(His slow run broke Kwang Soo's heart.)

608
00:23:52.284 --> 00:23:53.552
I can't find them no matter how thoroughly I look.

609
00:23:53.552 --> 00:23:55.987
(Members who are still hiding)

610
00:23:56.555 --> 00:23:59.591
(He arrives in front of the sound team where So Min is hiding.)

611
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:02.094
(Something is fishy here.)

612
00:24:03.729 --> 00:24:06.465
(So Min disguised herself as the equipment.)

613
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.739
(Excuse me. Hold on.)

614
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.242
(Ringing)

615
00:24:18.443 --> 00:24:19.611
(I must get out of here now.)

616
00:24:19.611 --> 00:24:21.346
He's not here? Where is he?

617
00:24:22.681 --> 00:24:25.484
(So Min can't see what's in front of her well.)

618
00:24:25.484 --> 00:24:26.785
What? What is this?

619
00:24:27.018 --> 00:24:28.053
You're out.

620
00:24:28.053 --> 00:24:30.822
- So Min, you're eliminated. - Kwang Soo, I...

621
00:24:31.289 --> 00:24:32.290
You're out.

622
00:24:32.724 --> 00:24:34.292
I literally tapped you like 30 times.

623
00:24:35.026 --> 00:24:36.528
You should know when you've been eliminated.

624
00:24:37.295 --> 00:24:38.697
Until when you are going to hide?

625
00:24:41.767 --> 00:24:43.935
I thought for sure that it was a guy, but it was So Min.

626
00:24:44.336 --> 00:24:47.806
(So Min is eliminated despite her embarrassing efforts.)

627
00:24:47.939 --> 00:24:50.842
- 10 seconds before the race ends. - I'm doomed.

628
00:24:51.777 --> 00:24:54.012
- 10, 9... - Wait.

629
00:24:54.012 --> 00:24:55.247
(Did they fly to the sky or go into the ground?)

630
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.617
(All he can see are the crew and the empty field.)

631
00:24:59.017 --> 00:25:01.386
(Let's hold out for 5 more seconds.)

632
00:25:02.888 --> 00:25:06.825
(Where on earth is everyone else?)

633
00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:09.795
- 2, 1. - Hold on a second.

634
00:25:10.028 --> 00:25:11.696
(Kwang Soo, Let's Play is over.)

635
00:25:11.797 --> 00:25:12.864
- Please be over. - One!

636
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:15.033
Great! I did it.

637
00:25:16.535 --> 00:25:18.136
- Where did they hide? They're good. - All right.

638
00:25:18.136 --> 00:25:20.305
Bell Hide and Seek has ended. Show yourselves!

639
00:25:24.142 --> 00:25:25.710
(He sticks his head out.)

640
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.445
(You didn't know this, did you?)

641
00:25:27.445 --> 00:25:29.581
- What? Seriously? - You didn't find me here, did you?

642
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:31.516
How could a person fit there?

643
00:25:31.516 --> 00:25:32.784
- Kwang Soo. - I mean...

644
00:25:32.784 --> 00:25:34.286
What were you doing?

645
00:25:34.286 --> 00:25:35.720
How could I find you here?

646
00:25:36.021 --> 00:25:37.489
Why not?

647
00:25:37.489 --> 00:25:39.191
I thought it was a pile of garbage.

648
00:25:40.292 --> 00:25:41.927
Did you only find one member?

649
00:25:41.927 --> 00:25:43.495
I found So Min and Seok Jin.

650
00:25:43.495 --> 00:25:45.130
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

651
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.367
My legs went numb.

652
00:25:50.769 --> 00:25:51.970
(He's enjoying the victory too.)

653
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.472
Goodness. I have pins and needles in my legs.

654
00:25:54.773 --> 00:25:56.274
- Ji Hyo, where were you? - Where did you hide?

655
00:25:56.441 --> 00:25:57.542
I was in the kitchen.

656
00:25:57.542 --> 00:25:59.044
- I was in the kitchen whole time. - Let me see.

657
00:25:59.044 --> 00:26:00.345
- I even checked the drawers. - Hey.

658
00:26:00.345 --> 00:26:02.247
- Goodness. - Why would you check the drawers?

659
00:26:02.347 --> 00:26:04.983
This time, Kwang Soo must find members who will hide...

660
00:26:04.983 --> 00:26:08.820
inside the house and eliminate them within five minutes.

661
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.058
(The same rules apply. He must find members hiding inside the house.)

662
00:26:13.525 --> 00:26:15.927
This time, I need some clues from the assistants.

663
00:26:17.195 --> 00:26:19.331
We have to find out who the assistants are among us.

664
00:26:20.832 --> 00:26:22.601
So there are the assistants.

665
00:26:24.936 --> 00:26:26.338
Are you the assistant? Are you going to make a noise?

666
00:26:26.338 --> 00:26:28.273
No, I'm not.

667
00:26:28.273 --> 00:26:30.041
- Are you the assistant? - Will you shout?

668
00:26:30.041 --> 00:26:31.977
- No. - The female assistant might be her.

669
00:26:32.811 --> 00:26:33.979
Sung Rok is suspicious too.

670
00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:37.015
Sung Rok looks like he's the assistant.

671
00:26:37.015 --> 00:26:38.083
Very much.

672
00:26:38.083 --> 00:26:41.019
- I can tell by his face. - What? Gosh.

673
00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:47.592
(Will they be able to get a clue regarding who the assistants are?)

674
00:26:48.994 --> 00:26:51.296
It's 10 seconds before the race starts.

675
00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.532
5, 4...

676
00:26:54.532 --> 00:26:55.634
(They must stay in hiding for 5 minutes...)

677
00:26:55.634 --> 00:26:56.635
(or touch the crocodile before Kwang Soo does.)

678
00:26:57.135 --> 00:26:58.270
- 2. - 2.

679
00:26:58.303 --> 00:26:59.771
- Open it when he enters. - One.

680
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.543
(If he finds a member and touch them or the crocodile, they are out.)

681
00:27:07.612 --> 00:27:09.180
(Ringing)

682
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.883
(Jae Seok begins his plan as soon as he hears the doorbell.)

683
00:27:11.883 --> 00:27:13.551
Let me go out first.

684
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.956
(While Kwang Soo tries to enter the house,)

685
00:27:17.956 --> 00:27:22.994
(he plans to run outside and touch the crocodile.)

686
00:27:23.695 --> 00:27:25.363
Let me go out first.

687
00:27:27.365 --> 00:27:28.800
Hold on.

688
00:27:29.734 --> 00:27:30.735
Jae Seok is eliminated.

689
00:27:31.136 --> 00:27:34.873
(He gets eliminated only after 2 seconds.)

690
00:27:34.873 --> 00:27:37.342
- Gosh, I thought it was a ghost. - Oh, dear.

691
00:27:37.342 --> 00:27:39.277
- Gosh. - You startled me.

692
00:27:39.344 --> 00:27:41.313
- Goodness. - I mean, why...

693
00:27:41.613 --> 00:27:43.782
- What are you doing? - Seok Jin is behind me.

694
00:27:43.782 --> 00:27:44.816
Seok Jin is behind me.

695
00:27:47.018 --> 00:27:52.624
(Jae Seok tries to drag Seok Jin down with him.)

696
00:27:53.458 --> 00:27:55.593
(Thank you for the nice information.)

697
00:27:55.593 --> 00:27:57.762
I should go inside the room.

698
00:27:58.263 --> 00:28:00.932
- Hey. - Seok Jin, you're out.

699
00:28:01.933 --> 00:28:03.702
- I should go inside the room. - Hey.

700
00:28:03.702 --> 00:28:06.137
(Seok Jin gets eliminated thanks to Jae Seok.)

701
00:28:06.137 --> 00:28:07.572
- You can touch me to eliminate me? - What?

702
00:28:08.173 --> 00:28:09.374
- Hey. - What?

703
00:28:09.474 --> 00:28:11.476
- Isn't this too much? - Hold on.

704
00:28:11.476 --> 00:28:14.813
(Why is he running when he's already out?)

705
00:28:16.181 --> 00:28:19.284
(Jong Kook quietly watches them from next door.)

706
00:28:21.453 --> 00:28:24.823
(Kwang Soo checks the windows first after eliminating the two.)

707
00:28:24.823 --> 00:28:25.824
Who's that?

708
00:28:25.824 --> 00:28:27.826
I think someone got caught. Oh, dear.

709
00:28:28.326 --> 00:28:29.327
Goodness.

710
00:28:30.228 --> 00:28:33.999
(While Kwang Soo is busy checking the room next door...)

711
00:28:35.633 --> 00:28:38.136
(Now is the time!)

712
00:28:38.136 --> 00:28:39.137
Wait a second.

713
00:28:40.705 --> 00:28:42.841
(He climbs over the window and runs straight to the crocodile.)

714
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:44.542
(He touches down with an incredible speed.)

715
00:28:44.542 --> 00:28:45.543
It's scary.

716
00:28:47.045 --> 00:28:49.881
(This is Jong Kook.)

717
00:28:49.881 --> 00:28:51.750
(Is he a human being or a spring?)

718
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.751
Is he out?

719
00:28:53.318 --> 00:28:55.120
I was going to touch him first.

720
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.522
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

721
00:28:58.289 --> 00:28:59.591
(He's checking on Haha's window.)

722
00:29:00.225 --> 00:29:01.259
Gosh.

723
00:29:03.328 --> 00:29:07.832
(The ace watches for a chance and runs with leisure.)

724
00:29:07.832 --> 00:29:08.800
Kwang Soo.

725
00:29:09.634 --> 00:29:10.969
When did you come out?

726
00:29:13.605 --> 00:29:16.441
(Sung Rok succeeds as well.)

727
00:29:16.441 --> 00:29:17.776
You're really bad at this.

728
00:29:18.209 --> 00:29:20.545
(While Kwang Soo enters the house,)

729
00:29:20.545 --> 00:29:21.980
(Haha tries to climb over the window swiftly.)

730
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.048
Haha's coming outside.

731
00:29:24.616 --> 00:29:26.117
- Haha's slow. - You're out.

732
00:29:26.484 --> 00:29:28.787
(Haha fails to succeed.)

733
00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:31.856
(Bo Mi was hiding behind the sofa.)

734
00:29:31.856 --> 00:29:34.793
(She comes out through the back door.)

735
00:29:37.295 --> 00:29:39.431
- Oh, no! - Bo Mi.

736
00:29:39.431 --> 00:29:40.465
(Bo Mi succeeds.)

737
00:29:40.465 --> 00:29:42.033
- Bo Mi's good. - Where were you?

738
00:29:42.033 --> 00:29:43.101
Can you hide outside?

739
00:29:44.002 --> 00:29:46.538
(There are only So Min and Se Chan left.)

740
00:29:46.538 --> 00:29:48.873
(He's determined to catch them.)

741
00:29:49.774 --> 00:29:54.813
(So Min plans to escape from the house like Jong Kook did.)

742
00:29:56.781 --> 00:30:01.953
(Let's fly like a butterfly and run away from Kwang Soo.)

743
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.991
(Will So Min's plan succeed?)

744
00:30:08.827 --> 00:30:09.861
It won't open.

745
00:30:10.862 --> 00:30:11.963
What?

746
00:30:11.963 --> 00:30:13.731
(What's going on?)

747
00:30:14.265 --> 00:30:15.266
Is this how you open it?

748
00:30:16.468 --> 00:30:20.205
I need to get out of here, but it won't open.

749
00:30:21.439 --> 00:30:23.308
It won't open.

750
00:30:23.308 --> 00:30:24.342
(She can't even open the window.)

751
00:30:26.444 --> 00:30:30.081
(He heard a loud bell sound in this room.)

752
00:30:30.081 --> 00:30:32.484
(He walks straight to the pillar.)

753
00:30:32.484 --> 00:30:33.985
So Min, you're really bad at hiding.

754
00:30:33.985 --> 00:30:36.788
(So Min, you're really bad at hiding.)

755
00:30:37.255 --> 00:30:39.124
- You're terrible at this game. - I mean...

756
00:30:39.124 --> 00:30:40.925
- The window won't open. - You're bad at this.

757
00:30:40.925 --> 00:30:43.027
This window won't open.

758
00:30:43.194 --> 00:30:44.729
- You opened it in a wrong way. - That's why I couldn't...

759
00:30:44.729 --> 00:30:45.964
(She wanted to escape like the Catwoman.)

760
00:30:46.131 --> 00:30:47.765
You have a minute left.

761
00:30:47.765 --> 00:30:49.534
(There's only Se Chan left in hiding.)

762
00:30:49.534 --> 00:30:51.336
(Where are you, Se Chan?)

763
00:30:53.571 --> 00:30:56.841
(Seok Jin suddenly enters the house.)

764
00:30:56.841 --> 00:30:57.842
Se Chan, come out.

765
00:30:57.842 --> 00:30:59.844
(Se Chan, come out.)

766
00:30:59.844 --> 00:31:00.912
Se Chan, now is the time.

767
00:31:01.713 --> 00:31:02.714
(Seok Jin tells him to come out.)

768
00:31:02.714 --> 00:31:05.083
Se Chan, come out now.

769
00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:08.386
(Seok Jin tells him to come out when Kwang Soo is around.)

770
00:31:08.953 --> 00:31:10.255
- What? - Se Chan.

771
00:31:10.255 --> 00:31:12.690
Seok Jin is helping Kwang Soo catch Se Chan.

772
00:31:13.825 --> 00:31:18.296
(He could've gotten eliminated if he came out.)

773
00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:19.531
(What's going on outside?)

774
00:31:19.531 --> 00:31:21.266
He's really cunning.

775
00:31:21.332 --> 00:31:25.603
How could he... Can he be so obvious in helping Kwang Soo?

776
00:31:25.603 --> 00:31:27.539
- What's that? - He's cunning.

777
00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:30.975
I only tried to help Se Chan.

778
00:31:31.042 --> 00:31:33.545
You're terrible at being the assistant.

779
00:31:33.545 --> 00:31:34.812
I know it's you.

780
00:31:34.946 --> 00:31:37.448
You're terrible at being the assistant.

781
00:31:37.448 --> 00:31:38.449
(Flustered)

782
00:31:39.217 --> 00:31:40.952
By the way, why aren't the assistants doing their job?

783
00:31:41.452 --> 00:31:43.321
Haha, why aren't you doing anything?

784
00:31:43.321 --> 00:31:45.290
You just did your job.

785
00:31:45.323 --> 00:31:47.525
You talked with Kwang Soo a while ago too.

786
00:31:47.525 --> 00:31:49.594
- You taught him where we were. - You should do your job.

787
00:31:49.594 --> 00:31:52.297
I asked you what you were doing and you got flustered.

788
00:31:53.831 --> 00:31:56.134
(The second round of Kwang Soo, Let's Play ends.)

789
00:31:56.134 --> 00:31:58.203
- Please come outside. - Goodness.

790
00:31:58.203 --> 00:31:59.837
How could you not find Se Chan?

791
00:32:00.004 --> 00:32:01.706
- He's nowhere to be found. - He's not in here.

792
00:32:01.706 --> 00:32:03.341
(Where did Se Chan hide?)

793
00:32:03.341 --> 00:32:04.342
I searched everywhere.

794
00:32:04.342 --> 00:32:05.710
(Where did Se Chan hide?)

795
00:32:08.846 --> 00:32:10.381
- He's in there? - Here.

796
00:32:10.548 --> 00:32:12.717
- Really? - My goodness.

797
00:32:12.884 --> 00:32:14.786
I didn't even know these doors can open.

798
00:32:14.786 --> 00:32:16.287
I almost got caught.

799
00:32:17.055 --> 00:32:19.257
- You're amazing. - I told you to come out.

800
00:32:19.257 --> 00:32:20.825
I knew Kwang Soo was around.

801
00:32:20.825 --> 00:32:22.293
Right. You heard him, right?

802
00:32:22.293 --> 00:32:24.429
- Yes, I heard. - I even saw him do it.

803
00:32:24.429 --> 00:32:26.264
You really shouldn't do that.

804
00:32:26.264 --> 00:32:27.632
You made it so obvious.

805
00:32:27.632 --> 00:32:29.701
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

806
00:32:29.701 --> 00:32:31.135
He really wasn't around.

807
00:32:31.703 --> 00:32:35.473
Se Chan heard him say things to Kwang Soo.

808
00:32:35.473 --> 00:32:37.675
No, we shouldn't assume.

809
00:32:38.209 --> 00:32:43.281
When we look at it in a broader way, he's too weak to be the assistant.

810
00:32:45.083 --> 00:32:47.051
You're exactly right.

811
00:32:47.252 --> 00:32:48.553
Look at it as a whole.

812
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.688
- Hey. - Gosh.

813
00:32:50.722 --> 00:32:52.523
I never said I'm the assistant.

814
00:32:52.523 --> 00:32:54.325
- He's too weak... - I never said that.

815
00:32:54.325 --> 00:32:56.194
He's too weak to be the assistant.

816
00:32:56.194 --> 00:32:57.762
Can I change my assistants?

817
00:32:57.762 --> 00:33:00.331
(Can I change my assistants?)

818
00:33:01.032 --> 00:33:03.935
You're making it sound like I'm the assistant.

819
00:33:04.802 --> 00:33:07.372
All right, I'll give the video hint to Haha and Sung Rok...

820
00:33:07.372 --> 00:33:10.541
since they placed first in each round.

821
00:33:10.975 --> 00:33:12.677
Please step forward.

822
00:33:12.677 --> 00:33:14.112
- Okay. - Oh, you'll show us with that.

823
00:33:14.746 --> 00:33:17.382
I'm 100 percent sure either one of them is the assistant.

824
00:33:17.382 --> 00:33:19.484
- Gosh. - They'll watch the hint now.

825
00:33:19.784 --> 00:33:20.852
I'm 100 percent sure.

826
00:33:20.852 --> 00:33:22.787
(He's calling us the assistant.)

827
00:33:22.787 --> 00:33:25.323
He says the assistant is either me or Sung Rok.

828
00:33:25.323 --> 00:33:27.458
- I'm sure. - He's sure of it.

829
00:33:27.458 --> 00:33:28.793
And he's the assistant himself.

830
00:33:29.761 --> 00:33:30.762
We'll watch it now.

831
00:33:30.762 --> 00:33:32.463
(They watch the first video hint.)

832
00:33:33.831 --> 00:33:35.967
I'm very much worried.

833
00:33:36.067 --> 00:33:39.304
To be honest, I'm not lucky in basically every game.

834
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.705
I have no luck in spinning roulettes.

835
00:33:41.272 --> 00:33:42.940
I have no luck in playing Dreadful Pirate either.

836
00:33:43.274 --> 00:33:46.544
That's why I'm worried I might be unlucky this time as well.

837
00:33:47.045 --> 00:33:49.614
I'm pretty much the same as you.

838
00:33:50.815 --> 00:33:52.617
Shall we go exorcise or something?

839
00:33:52.817 --> 00:33:55.486
What should we do? I have no luck either.

840
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.057
Now that I think about it, it's most likely that we won't succeed.

841
00:33:59.057 --> 00:34:00.792
What are you talking about?

842
00:34:02.727 --> 00:34:04.562
We must succeed no matter what.

843
00:34:05.596 --> 00:34:08.032
Here's something positive.

844
00:34:08.032 --> 00:34:11.235
A lot of the members aren't that lucky either.

845
00:34:11.903 --> 00:34:12.970
A lot of them.

846
00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:16.674
Let's get this done. Thank you in advance.

847
00:34:16.674 --> 00:34:19.544
(We aren't lucky, but we can do this.)

848
00:34:23.481 --> 00:34:24.615
It's for certain.

849
00:34:25.383 --> 00:34:26.751
I'm so curious.

850
00:34:27.151 --> 00:34:29.487
- You know who they are? - They can't share the hint, right?

851
00:34:29.487 --> 00:34:31.923
- They can't share it with others. - The first hint is big.

852
00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.926
Gosh, what should I do, Chul Min?

853
00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.561
Shall we do this again?

854
00:34:36.561 --> 00:34:37.562
(It's too certain.)

855
00:34:37.562 --> 00:34:38.563
Did the hint say his nose is big?

856
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.965
- Tell me. - I won't say anything.

857
00:34:41.366 --> 00:34:42.700
I'm free next week.

858
00:34:43.701 --> 00:34:45.203
(Is Seok Jin really the assistant?)

859
00:34:45.203 --> 00:34:47.171
(Or is Kwang Soo only pretending?)

860
00:34:47.171 --> 00:34:48.272
I'm free all week as well.

861
00:34:49.907 --> 00:34:51.843
(They're narrowing down the assistant candidates.)

862
00:34:51.843 --> 00:34:55.046
- It's cool and nice in here. - This won't do.

863
00:34:55.113 --> 00:34:56.280
Goodness.

864
00:34:56.547 --> 00:34:58.182
- Sit down. - Let's sit down.

865
00:34:58.182 --> 00:34:59.150
What's wrong, Bo Mi?

866
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:00.485
Oh, I'm just hungry.

867
00:35:00.651 --> 00:35:02.487
- Gosh, I thought you were sick. - No, I'm not.

868
00:35:02.754 --> 00:35:04.255
I'm really hungry too.

869
00:35:04.756 --> 00:35:05.923
Are you hungry?

870
00:35:05.923 --> 00:35:07.258
- Yes. - Very much.

871
00:35:07.258 --> 00:35:09.093
It's lunchtime now.

872
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.963
We've prepared a menu for your lunch.

873
00:35:11.963 --> 00:35:12.964
- Really? - Please make orders.

874
00:35:12.964 --> 00:35:14.932
I'm sure they won't give us food for free.

875
00:35:15.366 --> 00:35:16.801
There it is.

876
00:35:16.801 --> 00:35:19.537
- Here comes the menu. - It's Chinese cuisine.

877
00:35:19.537 --> 00:35:20.571
- Gosh. - Shrimp fried rice.

878
00:35:20.571 --> 00:35:22.440
- I want shrimp fried rice. - I'll take what I want to have.

879
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.441
Here. Let me hold this for you.

880
00:35:23.775 --> 00:35:25.810
- Will we have to play some game? - Jjajangmyeon.

881
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.078
- I'm having what I want to have. - I'll have jjajangmyeon.

882
00:35:27.078 --> 00:35:28.880
- I'll have jjamppong. - There's ulmyeon too.

883
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.382
- They all sound delicious. - It's either jjamppong or jjajang.

884
00:35:31.382 --> 00:35:33.251
- Gosh. - Can I take seafood jjamppong?

885
00:35:33.251 --> 00:35:34.652
I don't eat seafood.

886
00:35:34.652 --> 00:35:35.820
I'll take japchae.

887
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.556
- I'll take seafood jjajangmyeon. - Let's share.

888
00:35:39.056 --> 00:35:41.192
- Respect, respect. - Respect.

889
00:35:41.192 --> 00:35:43.327
Then I'll take japchae rice.

890
00:35:43.928 --> 00:35:45.029
I'll take ganjjajang.

891
00:35:45.196 --> 00:35:49.100
Then I'll take seafood jjajang.

892
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.134
I'll take plain jjajang.

893
00:35:50.134 --> 00:35:52.236
- I'll take plain jjajangmyeon too. - I'll have ganjjajang.

894
00:35:52.537 --> 00:35:54.071
Both of you chose plain jjajang.

895
00:35:54.906 --> 00:35:56.674
(It's just a coincidence.)

896
00:35:56.674 --> 00:35:57.675
Come on.

897
00:35:57.942 --> 00:35:59.343
- I always take plain jjajang. - Stop it.

898
00:35:59.343 --> 00:36:00.778
- That's what I always have. - Ulmyeon?

899
00:36:01.345 --> 00:36:03.981
- Seafood jaengban jjamppong. - Seafood jjamppong.

900
00:36:03.981 --> 00:36:05.983
- Seafood jjamppong? - Seafood jjamppong?

901
00:36:05.983 --> 00:36:07.952
- Seafood jaengban jjamppong. - Seafood jaengban jjamppong.

902
00:36:07.952 --> 00:36:11.255
(They joke around with the dish names.)

903
00:36:11.255 --> 00:36:12.256
Okay.

904
00:36:12.256 --> 00:36:15.660
You know, we're being like the typical middle-aged men now.

905
00:36:15.793 --> 00:36:18.162
- Gosh, it's so annoying to hear. - Too much like them.

906
00:36:18.162 --> 00:36:19.864
It's so annoying to hear.

907
00:36:19.864 --> 00:36:21.966
- Are you saying that we sound old? - No, we are just old.

908
00:36:21.966 --> 00:36:23.634
Seafood Jjamppong.

909
00:36:23.634 --> 00:36:24.635
(They're in their 40s and 50s.)

910
00:36:24.635 --> 00:36:25.803
- Jjajangmyeon. - No.

911
00:36:25.903 --> 00:36:27.572
Does any of you want to change your dish?

912
00:36:27.572 --> 00:36:28.806
- No. - No.

913
00:36:28.806 --> 00:36:29.807
- Never. - Never.

914
00:36:29.807 --> 00:36:30.808
Let's just do it.

915
00:36:30.808 --> 00:36:32.343
Such teamwork.

916
00:36:32.443 --> 00:36:35.680
- Respect, respect, big respect. - Respect, respect, big respect.

917
00:36:35.847 --> 00:36:37.114
Superman, Superman...

918
00:36:37.114 --> 00:36:38.716
- Superman? - Superman?

919
00:36:38.716 --> 00:36:40.885
That's mine.

920
00:36:40.885 --> 00:36:42.153
Go with Wonder Woman.

921
00:36:42.153 --> 00:36:43.654
Wonder, Wonder Woman.

922
00:36:43.654 --> 00:36:45.056
(Laughing)

923
00:36:45.423 --> 00:36:47.925
Seok Jin seems to want to join.

924
00:36:48.593 --> 00:36:49.861
I shouldn't do it.

925
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:50.928
He can't speak fast.

926
00:36:50.928 --> 00:36:53.097
Assistant, assistant, assistant.

927
00:36:54.532 --> 00:36:56.234
- Respect, respect... - Stop it.

928
00:36:56.234 --> 00:36:57.235
Gosh.

929
00:36:57.235 --> 00:36:58.903
- That's you. - You got caught in the first round.

930
00:36:58.903 --> 00:37:00.905
- Assistant, assistant, assistant... - You got caught in the first round.

931
00:37:00.905 --> 00:37:02.640
You got caught right in the beginning.

932
00:37:03.074 --> 00:37:04.075
(I'm not an assistant.)

933
00:37:04.075 --> 00:37:05.676
- Assistant, assistant... - That's hilarious.

934
00:37:06.177 --> 00:37:08.946
(Are we just getting the food we ordered?)

935
00:37:10.281 --> 00:37:11.482
(They're waiting for their lunch.)

936
00:37:11.482 --> 00:37:13.484
The order has been made.

937
00:37:13.484 --> 00:37:15.286
While waiting for your food,

938
00:37:15.286 --> 00:37:18.923
you'll play a game where the winner can watch...

939
00:37:18.923 --> 00:37:20.691
- another hint video. - What's the game?

940
00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:21.993
There are so many videos.

941
00:37:22.193 --> 00:37:26.330
The game is dedicated to our hopeless romantic, Kwang Soo.

942
00:37:27.031 --> 00:37:31.202
It's based on a survey of singles in their 20s and 30s.

943
00:37:31.202 --> 00:37:33.404
Temperature of Love Questionnaire.

944
00:37:33.404 --> 00:37:37.341
(Temperature of Love Questionnaire)

945
00:37:37.341 --> 00:37:40.511
The survey consisted of popular questions on dating.

946
00:37:40.511 --> 00:37:42.046
(They have to guess which option was chosen by the majority.)

947
00:37:42.046 --> 00:37:43.114
That sounds fun.

948
00:37:43.948 --> 00:37:45.349
It's a team competition.

949
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:49.253
It's Kwang Soo versus...

950
00:37:49.253 --> 00:37:53.190
teams of 3 formed by Kwang Soo.

951
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.094
(Kwang Soo versus 3 teams of 3 people)

952
00:37:57.094 --> 00:38:00.031
These two will be in different teams.

953
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:01.832
(You two can lead separate teams.)

954
00:38:01.933 --> 00:38:04.402
Please make sure every team has at least one female member.

955
00:38:04.969 --> 00:38:06.537
Let me tell you...

956
00:38:06.871 --> 00:38:08.673
how you choose your answer.

957
00:38:08.673 --> 00:38:11.042
(They'll be stacked on each other.)

958
00:38:11.442 --> 00:38:13.444
When the whistle blows,

959
00:38:13.444 --> 00:38:15.846
you'll be stacked on each other.

960
00:38:15.846 --> 00:38:17.181
(They'll compete to be where in the stack they want to be.)

961
00:38:17.181 --> 00:38:19.350
The number of the option will dictate where you want to go.

962
00:38:19.483 --> 00:38:22.553
The lowest layer becomes number 1, the highest number 4.

963
00:38:22.553 --> 00:38:24.889
(The bottom layer becomes number 1, and the top layer number 4.)

964
00:38:26.557 --> 00:38:28.693
Why aren't the assistants doing anything?

965
00:38:28.693 --> 00:38:31.963
(It's so random.)

966
00:38:31.963 --> 00:38:33.097
Are they doing something?

967
00:38:33.731 --> 00:38:36.100
(Seok Jin)

968
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.235
(That's so random.)

969
00:38:38.235 --> 00:38:42.173
You should have planned those words beforehand.

970
00:38:42.173 --> 00:38:45.443
Seok Jin should have had a rehearsal.

971
00:38:45.443 --> 00:38:47.945
(If he turns out not to be an assistant, that'd be weird too.)

972
00:38:48.045 --> 00:38:50.114
Why aren't the assistants doing anything?

973
00:38:50.281 --> 00:38:51.482
Please do something.

974
00:38:52.216 --> 00:38:55.252
(Seok Jin, please stop. I'll deal with it on my own.)

975
00:38:55.252 --> 00:38:57.655
- Kwang Soo, please form the teams. - Okay.

976
00:38:57.922 --> 00:38:59.256
Is Kwang Soo going to decide?

977
00:38:59.256 --> 00:39:00.925
Yes, he'll form the teams.

978
00:39:01.092 --> 00:39:03.561
Team Red...

979
00:39:03.561 --> 00:39:05.463
(Team Red)

980
00:39:05.463 --> 00:39:06.797
- It should be Jong Kook's team. - Okay.

981
00:39:06.797 --> 00:39:07.965
- Me? - Yes,

982
00:39:08.366 --> 00:39:09.400
Okay.

983
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.736
All members of the winning team will watch the video.

984
00:39:11.736 --> 00:39:13.004
- Really? - Really?

985
00:39:13.404 --> 00:39:14.505
- Yes. - Then it's important.

986
00:39:14.505 --> 00:39:16.574
Give me one of those red vests.

987
00:39:16.574 --> 00:39:17.775
(I want to be in the same team as Jong Kook.)

988
00:39:17.775 --> 00:39:19.076
I'm so tired.

989
00:39:19.076 --> 00:39:20.344
(Let me team up with Jong Kook.)

990
00:39:20.344 --> 00:39:22.013
(Ignoring)

991
00:39:22.713 --> 00:39:24.348
Give them to clumsy ones.

992
00:39:24.482 --> 00:39:25.850
One for you then.

993
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:27.985
(Give them to clumsy ones.)

994
00:39:27.985 --> 00:39:29.320
(One for you then.)

995
00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.656
(Embarrassed)

996
00:39:31.656 --> 00:39:32.657
Nice.

997
00:39:32.657 --> 00:39:34.825
- One for his assistant. - Lastly...

998
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.961
So Min.

999
00:39:37.461 --> 00:39:39.096
She's clumsy too.

1000
00:39:39.697 --> 00:39:41.432
On Jong Kook's team...

1001
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.136
They got caught by me in the last game.

1002
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.139
- They're both clumsy. - We're the clumsy ones.

1003
00:39:48.139 --> 00:39:50.074
- They're the clumsy ones... - They're clumsy.

1004
00:39:50.541 --> 00:39:52.810
Clumsy Jeon and Awkward Jee.

1005
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.212
- Team Clumsy. - Team Clumsy.

1006
00:39:55.446 --> 00:39:56.580
Cross.

1007
00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.082
(Clumsy Jeon and Awkward Jee)

1008
00:39:58.282 --> 00:40:00.151
(Team Red: Jong Kook, Seok Jin, and So Min)

1009
00:40:00.151 --> 00:40:02.219
(Team Green: Jae Seok, Sung Rok, and Ji Hyo)

1010
00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:04.055
(Team White: Haha, Se Chan, and Bo Mi)

1011
00:40:04.055 --> 00:40:06.023
This question is...

1012
00:40:06.657 --> 00:40:07.925
for male members.

1013
00:40:07.925 --> 00:40:10.695
Okay. Sung Rok will play for us.

1014
00:40:10.695 --> 00:40:12.263
Please pick one male member.

1015
00:40:12.263 --> 00:40:13.698
- Jong Kook. - Let's do this.

1016
00:40:13.698 --> 00:40:15.132
(Haha is representing Team White.)

1017
00:40:15.132 --> 00:40:16.734
If you think number three is the correct answer,

1018
00:40:16.967 --> 00:40:18.736
you have to try to be the third layer.

1019
00:40:18.736 --> 00:40:20.171
If you want to be the third layer,

1020
00:40:20.171 --> 00:40:21.906
do you wait for two people to stack up...

1021
00:40:21.906 --> 00:40:23.574
or do you stack them up yourself?

1022
00:40:24.175 --> 00:40:26.043
- What do you do? - Do whatever you want.

1023
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.612
Can you do what you want?

1024
00:40:28.713 --> 00:40:30.347
I suddenly feel so tired.

1025
00:40:30.347 --> 00:40:33.384
(I suddenly feel so tired.)

1026
00:40:33.651 --> 00:40:35.219
- Respect, respect. - Respect.

1027
00:40:35.219 --> 00:40:36.620
Respect, respect.

1028
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.922
Respect.

1029
00:40:38.522 --> 00:40:40.191
We're so tired.

1030
00:40:40.691 --> 00:40:43.594
Here goes question number one.

1031
00:40:43.828 --> 00:40:45.429
Here we go.

1032
00:40:46.097 --> 00:40:47.798
"You get a text from your crush late at night..."

1033
00:40:47.798 --> 00:40:49.700
"asking if you're asleep. What would you do?"

1034
00:40:49.867 --> 00:40:52.036
Number 1 is texting "No" right away.

1035
00:40:52.036 --> 00:40:54.805
Number 2 is texting "I'm having a beer" after a moment.

1036
00:40:55.773 --> 00:40:58.576
You'd do the first one, right? You'd text "No" right away.

1037
00:40:58.743 --> 00:41:00.010
Yes.

1038
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:01.412
I think...

1039
00:41:01.412 --> 00:41:03.981
I think it's number 4.

1040
00:41:04.181 --> 00:41:06.117
- I think it's number 1. - "I didn't see your message."

1041
00:41:06.117 --> 00:41:07.885
Let's stick to our first choice, number 1.

1042
00:41:07.885 --> 00:41:09.320
- It's either number 1 or 2. - Go with number 1.

1043
00:41:09.487 --> 00:41:11.889
I think it's either number 1 or 2.

1044
00:41:12.156 --> 00:41:14.091
It could be number 1.

1045
00:41:14.091 --> 00:41:15.159
I'm sorry,

1046
00:41:15.159 --> 00:41:17.461
but shouldn't you be thinking to yourself?

1047
00:41:17.461 --> 00:41:20.531
(Shouldn't you be thinking to yourself?)

1048
00:41:20.531 --> 00:41:22.700
I couldn't be standing here quietly.

1049
00:41:22.867 --> 00:41:23.901
Have you made up your mind?

1050
00:41:23.901 --> 00:41:25.369
- Yes. - Please.

1051
00:41:25.736 --> 00:41:28.906
Ready...

1052
00:41:28.906 --> 00:41:29.940
(Stacking is more important.)

1053
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:30.941
(Stacking starts.)

1054
00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:32.676
I think it's number 1.

1055
00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.713
(Let me be the 1st layer.)

1056
00:41:35.713 --> 00:41:36.714
It's number 1.

1057
00:41:36.714 --> 00:41:39.750
(Excuse me.)

1058
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.219
Sung Rok is pushing in.

1059
00:41:42.486 --> 00:41:44.255
- You want to be the 1st layer? - Yes.

1060
00:41:46.056 --> 00:41:47.691
Can you lie on your back too?

1061
00:41:47.925 --> 00:41:49.794
- There you go. - Number 2 can't be right.

1062
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.695
- You think so? - It can't be.

1063
00:41:51.962 --> 00:41:53.130
Is it number 1?

1064
00:41:53.364 --> 00:41:55.432
Sung Rok is the first layer now.

1065
00:41:55.966 --> 00:41:57.501
- Sung Rok is the first layer. - Jong Kook!

1066
00:41:58.302 --> 00:41:59.737
Sung Rok is the 1st layer.

1067
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:01.372
The correct answer might be number 4.

1068
00:42:02.006 --> 00:42:03.674
- I can't wait. - Stop.

1069
00:42:03.674 --> 00:42:05.142
I'm not sure.

1070
00:42:07.511 --> 00:42:08.813
The correct answer is...

1071
00:42:08.946 --> 00:42:10.047
Which one is it?

1072
00:42:10.047 --> 00:42:11.715
It was chosen by 40 percent of the respondents.

1073
00:42:11.715 --> 00:42:13.117
Really?

1074
00:42:13.117 --> 00:42:16.420
(It was chosen by 40 percent of the respondents.)

1075
00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.756
(Is it number 1?)

1076
00:42:18.756 --> 00:42:20.925
Number 1, texting "No" right away.

1077
00:42:20.925 --> 00:42:22.593
(Team Green wins.)

1078
00:42:22.593 --> 00:42:23.961
Number 1 was the simplest.

1079
00:42:23.961 --> 00:42:25.062
Number 1.

1080
00:42:25.196 --> 00:42:26.597
Number 2,

1081
00:42:26.597 --> 00:42:29.233
"I'm having a beer" was chosen by 37 percent.

1082
00:42:29.233 --> 00:42:30.301
I see.

1083
00:42:31.035 --> 00:42:32.636
It was either number 1 or 2.

1084
00:42:32.636 --> 00:42:35.139
I thought it'd be number 3.

1085
00:42:35.139 --> 00:42:36.307
Me too.

1086
00:42:36.307 --> 00:42:38.642
Number 3, "I was working",

1087
00:42:38.642 --> 00:42:40.010
was chosen by the least people, 4 percent.

1088
00:42:40.511 --> 00:42:41.846
You're the worst kind of guy.

1089
00:42:41.846 --> 00:42:43.447
(It was chosen by the least number of people.)

1090
00:42:43.447 --> 00:42:44.782
The worst kind of guy.

1091
00:42:45.049 --> 00:42:47.551
I've been getting advice from Jae Seok.

1092
00:42:47.551 --> 00:42:48.752
That's why I'm still single.

1093
00:42:49.253 --> 00:42:51.422
- We're in that 4 percent. - Yes.

1094
00:42:51.422 --> 00:42:53.324
- We're in that 4 percent. - 4 percent.

1095
00:42:54.091 --> 00:42:55.960
(They know nothing about dating.)

1096
00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.695
What would you do, Bo Mi?

1097
00:42:57.695 --> 00:42:59.363
- Number 2. - Why?

1098
00:43:00.197 --> 00:43:03.133
I couldn't wait too long if he's my crush.

1099
00:43:03.133 --> 00:43:04.501
You're leading him to say, "Can I join?"

1100
00:43:04.501 --> 00:43:06.237
- Exactly. - Number 2...

1101
00:43:06.237 --> 00:43:10.441
What did you do when Kwang Soo video called you at night?

1102
00:43:10.441 --> 00:43:12.176
(What about when Kwang Soo video called Bo Mi?)

1103
00:43:12.443 --> 00:43:16.614
(Kwang Soo, while drunk, woke Bo Mi up.)

1104
00:43:16.614 --> 00:43:17.781
What did you do?

1105
00:43:18.616 --> 00:43:20.784
(What did she do?)

1106
00:43:20.784 --> 00:43:23.988
I had to work.

1107
00:43:23.988 --> 00:43:26.657
"I didn't see your message because I was working."

1108
00:43:26.657 --> 00:43:28.025
That's great.

1109
00:43:28.092 --> 00:43:30.928
You would have seen it late because of work too.

1110
00:43:30.928 --> 00:43:31.929
- Yes. - Right.

1111
00:43:31.929 --> 00:43:33.197
She's in that four percent too.

1112
00:43:33.297 --> 00:43:34.531
Bo Mi is in that four percent.

1113
00:43:34.732 --> 00:43:36.133
What about you, Sung Rok?

1114
00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.302
If you just write, "No",

1115
00:43:38.502 --> 00:43:41.872
the other person will have to say something.

1116
00:43:41.872 --> 00:43:43.307
You're so smart.

1117
00:43:43.407 --> 00:43:45.676
Then afterwards, I could suggest having a beer together...

1118
00:43:45.676 --> 00:43:47.912
- or say I was working. - You'd just write, "No."

1119
00:43:47.912 --> 00:43:48.946
Yes.

1120
00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.048
He's so smart.

1121
00:43:51.548 --> 00:43:52.983
He's a dating expert.

1122
00:43:53.384 --> 00:43:55.352
- Jong Kook, what about you? - I'd write, "No."

1123
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.922
When I have a crush on someone,

1124
00:43:57.922 --> 00:44:00.491
I like to tease her.

1125
00:44:00.491 --> 00:44:02.026
So...

1126
00:44:02.026 --> 00:44:03.961
Because you're shy?

1127
00:44:03.961 --> 00:44:06.230
Yes. If she asks me what I'm doing,

1128
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:10.367
I'd say, "Everything except thinking about you".

1129
00:44:11.635 --> 00:44:12.903
As a joke.

1130
00:44:14.672 --> 00:44:19.043
(Everything except thinking about you?)

1131
00:44:19.043 --> 00:44:20.844
- What? - Jong Kook.

1132
00:44:20.844 --> 00:44:21.845
(Screaming)

1133
00:44:21.845 --> 00:44:22.980
- Calm down. - What's with you?

1134
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.381
Let me explain.

1135
00:44:24.381 --> 00:44:25.382
It's not like that.

1136
00:44:25.716 --> 00:44:27.217
I hate it.

1137
00:44:27.217 --> 00:44:29.820
Bo Mi hates guys who do that.

1138
00:44:30.654 --> 00:44:33.190
- It's just an example. - Hey!

1139
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.559
You hate it, right? She hates it.

1140
00:44:35.559 --> 00:44:38.262
Let's say Jong Kook wrote, "Everything..."

1141
00:44:38.262 --> 00:44:40.864
- I don't actually do that. - "except thinking about you."

1142
00:44:41.332 --> 00:44:43.300
What would you write back?

1143
00:44:43.901 --> 00:44:46.236
- I wouldn't write anything. - She'd ignore it.

1144
00:44:46.236 --> 00:44:47.571
(I wouldn't write anything.)

1145
00:44:47.571 --> 00:44:48.739
(She'd ignore it.)

1146
00:44:48.739 --> 00:44:50.341
She'd ignore it.

1147
00:44:50.341 --> 00:44:52.309
- She'd ignore it. - Please ask me.

1148
00:44:52.676 --> 00:44:54.111
What about you, So Min?

1149
00:44:54.111 --> 00:44:55.412
"Why are you not thinking about me?"

1150
00:44:55.579 --> 00:44:57.114
- There you go. - She took the bait.

1151
00:44:57.114 --> 00:44:59.883
Sometimes, the girl takes the bait.

1152
00:44:59.883 --> 00:45:01.051
I would.

1153
00:45:02.753 --> 00:45:04.421
Let's say the girl wrote that...
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1154
00:45:04.421 --> 00:45:06.323
- to me. - What should I say?

1155
00:45:06.557 --> 00:45:09.026
"Why are you not thinking about me?"

1156
00:45:09.927 --> 00:45:11.161
"If I do, I won't be able to sleep."

1157
00:45:12.663 --> 00:45:14.531
(So Min falls again.)

1158
00:45:14.531 --> 00:45:15.799
Then what would you say?

1159
00:45:16.467 --> 00:45:19.370
(What are they doing?)

1160
00:45:20.004 --> 00:45:22.139
Jong Kook, Bo Mi is still ignoring your messages.

1161
00:45:22.306 --> 00:45:24.641
She's still ignoring them.

1162
00:45:24.641 --> 00:45:25.776
At least one girl took the bait.

1163
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.177
So Min loves these things.

1164
00:45:27.177 --> 00:45:28.579
- She loves it. - She does.

1165
00:45:28.579 --> 00:45:29.580
(What would So Min write back?)

1166
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.881
"Why wouldn't you be able to sleep?"

1167
00:45:31.348 --> 00:45:33.717
- "Because you'd miss me too much?" - Cut it out.

1168
00:45:33.717 --> 00:45:35.853
(Because you'd miss me too much?)

1169
00:45:35.853 --> 00:45:37.921
(Cut it out.)

1170
00:45:37.921 --> 00:45:39.056
Respect.

1171
00:45:39.056 --> 00:45:41.258
- I can't stand it. - Be quiet.

1172
00:45:41.492 --> 00:45:43.260
- I've had enough. - Be quiet.

1173
00:45:44.061 --> 00:45:46.130
- I don't actually do this. - So Min looks so happy.

1174
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.098
What would you write back?

1175
00:45:48.098 --> 00:45:51.468
I just say it as a joke.

1176
00:45:51.902 --> 00:45:54.304
I can't believe I've been getting advice from those two.

1177
00:45:54.304 --> 00:45:56.507
I'm experienced.

1178
00:45:57.841 --> 00:45:58.942
Male members will play again.

1179
00:45:58.942 --> 00:46:00.210
I'll go this time.

1180
00:46:00.611 --> 00:46:02.446
- Those who haven't played... - It's weak ones this time.

1181
00:46:02.446 --> 00:46:03.714
You should...

1182
00:46:03.714 --> 00:46:04.982
Let's do this.

1183
00:46:04.982 --> 00:46:06.884
- You should wait. - You're right.

1184
00:46:06.884 --> 00:46:08.218
- I have a chance this time. - You shouldn't lie down too fast.

1185
00:46:09.386 --> 00:46:14.191
The next question was answered by men in their 20s and 30s.

1186
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:16.193
- Men? - Only men?

1187
00:46:16.193 --> 00:46:17.528
Then I have an advantage.

1188
00:46:17.961 --> 00:46:20.364
Here goes the question.

1189
00:46:20.364 --> 00:46:21.698
Let's do this.

1190
00:46:21.698 --> 00:46:24.134
"Your girlfriend asks how many girls you have dated. What's your answer?"

1191
00:46:24.134 --> 00:46:26.003
Number 1, "Tell her how many girls you have dated."

1192
00:46:26.003 --> 00:46:27.805
Number 2, "Ask her the same question."

1193
00:46:28.072 --> 00:46:30.941
Number 3, "Ask her what counts as a girlfriend."

1194
00:46:30.941 --> 00:46:32.443
Number 4, "Of course you are my first and last love."

1195
00:46:32.443 --> 00:46:34.344
- Number d4. - Of course it's number 4.

1196
00:46:34.344 --> 00:46:37.481
"Of course you are my first and last love."

1197
00:46:37.481 --> 00:46:39.616
For me, it's number 1. I reveal everything.

1198
00:46:39.716 --> 00:46:41.051
- Why would you do that? - I reveal everything.

1199
00:46:41.351 --> 00:46:42.986
I think it's number 4.

1200
00:46:42.986 --> 00:46:44.721
- It's number 4. - It's number 4.

1201
00:46:44.721 --> 00:46:45.722
Number 4 is too romantic.

1202
00:46:45.722 --> 00:46:48.092
No one wants number 2, right? I will choose number 2.

1203
00:46:48.892 --> 00:46:50.427
- Get ready. - Get down on the floor.

1204
00:46:50.427 --> 00:46:51.695
- Don't tell me what to do. - Set.

1205
00:46:51.695 --> 00:46:52.863
(The stacking begins.)

1206
00:46:52.863 --> 00:46:53.931
No, no.

1207
00:46:54.198 --> 00:46:55.466
Let's put him on the bottom. He is strong.

1208
00:46:55.966 --> 00:46:57.401
- Let's do that. - Let's do that.

1209
00:46:57.401 --> 00:46:59.403
- Go to the bottom. - I will get away.

1210
00:46:59.403 --> 00:47:00.637
Come on.

1211
00:47:01.905 --> 00:47:03.240
Wait a minute.

1212
00:47:04.274 --> 00:47:06.176
(He strikes back with his sharp chin.)

1213
00:47:06.176 --> 00:47:07.911
This is getting dirty.

1214
00:47:07.911 --> 00:47:09.613
Hey, hey.

1215
00:47:09.613 --> 00:47:11.582
My goodness, wait a minute.

1216
00:47:11.615 --> 00:47:13.951
I don't want to choose number 3.

1217
00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:14.952
(The stacking ends.)

1218
00:47:15.152 --> 00:47:16.253
I don't want to choose number 3.

1219
00:47:18.655 --> 00:47:19.756
- Number 2. - Number 4.

1220
00:47:19.756 --> 00:47:21.925
- The answer is... - Number 4.

1221
00:47:21.925 --> 00:47:24.528
(Everyone in the winning team gets to watch a hint video.)

1222
00:47:24.528 --> 00:47:25.696
Number 4 is too cheesy.

1223
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:28.966
- The answer is... - Number 4 is too cheesy.

1224
00:47:28.966 --> 00:47:30.134
number 1.

1225
00:47:30.134 --> 00:47:33.403
(Team White wins.)

1226
00:47:33.403 --> 00:47:38.075
- Respect, respect. - Respect, respect.

1227
00:47:38.075 --> 00:47:40.444
- Really? - I would tell my girlfriend.

1228
00:47:40.444 --> 00:47:42.279
That's what people do these days.

1229
00:47:42.279 --> 00:47:46.116
I thought the answer would be...

1230
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:47.651
either number 1 or 4.

1231
00:47:47.851 --> 00:47:49.987
Then I thought a girlfriend might get upset...

1232
00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.756
- by number 1. - Number 4 is the best.

1233
00:47:53.023 --> 00:47:56.326
Bo Mi, in a woman's point of view, which option is the best?

1234
00:47:56.426 --> 00:47:59.096
I like either number 1 or 2.

1235
00:47:59.096 --> 00:48:01.031
- It's not number 4. - Women don't like number 4.

1236
00:48:01.031 --> 00:48:02.966
Do you prefer hearing, "Right back at you"?

1237
00:48:03.033 --> 00:48:04.501
I wouldn't like it if he says, "Right back at you."

1238
00:48:04.501 --> 00:48:06.236
"How many boys have you dated?"

1239
00:48:06.236 --> 00:48:07.771
- Is that better? - He could ask me that.

1240
00:48:07.771 --> 00:48:10.073
It's better to ask playfully. "How many boys have you dated?"

1241
00:48:10.073 --> 00:48:11.842
It's another way of saying, "The past isn't important."

1242
00:48:12.176 --> 00:48:14.178
- That's right. - You are a loving man.

1243
00:48:14.344 --> 00:48:16.113
- You are a loving man. - What about you, So Min?

1244
00:48:16.113 --> 00:48:17.981
- I like number 4. - Of course you do.

1245
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:19.349
They say ignorance is bliss.

1246
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:21.885
I wouldn't want to keep thinking about my boyfriend's past.

1247
00:48:21.885 --> 00:48:24.488
That's why it's better to reveal everything.

1248
00:48:24.488 --> 00:48:27.057
Why don't you ask the question to Jong Kook?

1249
00:48:27.057 --> 00:48:29.693
Jong Kook says he will tell all. Act out the situation.

1250
00:48:29.793 --> 00:48:32.095
How many girls have you dated?

1251
00:48:32.095 --> 00:48:33.530
Do I need to reveal it here?

1252
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.933
(I am on a shoot.)

1253
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.001
- There are a lot of cameras. - Tell us.

1254
00:48:38.001 --> 00:48:39.136
This is Truth or Dare.

1255
00:48:39.303 --> 00:48:42.239
Even though there are cameras, imagine that we are by ourselves.

1256
00:48:42.573 --> 00:48:43.941
- You have dated a lot of women. - That's a lot.

1257
00:48:43.941 --> 00:48:47.544
Which one did you love the most? Rank them from top 1 to 8.

1258
00:48:47.544 --> 00:48:50.480
(Which one did you love the most? Rank them from top 1 to 8.)

1259
00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.483
The woman I broke up with the most recently is the one...

1260
00:48:53.483 --> 00:48:54.851
- I loved the most. - The most recent one?

1261
00:48:54.851 --> 00:48:56.753
- How do I rank? - You?

1262
00:48:56.887 --> 00:48:58.889
It hasn't been long since we met. I don't love you.

1263
00:48:59.656 --> 00:49:00.891
Are you sure this is better?

1264
00:49:01.091 --> 00:49:02.693
- Is this better? - Is this better?

1265
00:49:02.693 --> 00:49:04.795
Is this really better?

1266
00:49:04.962 --> 00:49:06.430
- This is how the conversation goes. - Then why are you dating me?

1267
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:07.965
It's too early to talk about love.

1268
00:49:07.965 --> 00:49:10.734
Will you give me a place only after you break up with me?

1269
00:49:11.101 --> 00:49:12.903
So Min got him.

1270
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.405
- So Min is hard to beat. - That's right.

1271
00:49:15.872 --> 00:49:17.140
You will be top one when we get married.

1272
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:20.043
You can't ensure that we will get married.

1273
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:22.112
Isn't this the end of their schedule?

1274
00:49:22.579 --> 00:49:23.947
That kind of a situation means...

1275
00:49:23.947 --> 00:49:25.716
(Isn't this the end of their schedule?)

1276
00:49:25.716 --> 00:49:27.384
- That kind of a situation means... - They would get annoyed.

1277
00:49:27.384 --> 00:49:28.752
the end of their schedule for the day.

1278
00:49:28.952 --> 00:49:29.987
Listen.

1279
00:49:30.654 --> 00:49:32.256
They would have to stop the car.

1280
00:49:32.823 --> 00:49:34.825
- They would have to stop the car. - They would have to do that.

1281
00:49:34.825 --> 00:49:36.059
(There is a 100 percent chance the couple would stop the car.)

1282
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.196
You didn't marry your previous girlfriends.

1283
00:49:39.196 --> 00:49:40.631
- I didn't love them enough. - You might not marry me.

1284
00:49:40.797 --> 00:49:42.032
Ask her how many men she has dated.

1285
00:49:42.032 --> 00:49:44.034
Stay out of it.

1286
00:49:44.034 --> 00:49:47.070
(This is getting interesting.)

1287
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:48.272
What do you think you are doing?

1288
00:49:48.272 --> 00:49:50.340
- Who are you? - What do you think you are doing?

1289
00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.675
Go on your way.

1290
00:49:52.042 --> 00:49:53.710
This is the highlight.

1291
00:49:54.344 --> 00:49:57.114
For goodness' sake. What do you think you are doing?

1292
00:49:57.481 --> 00:50:00.550
We were at the most important part.

1293
00:50:01.151 --> 00:50:02.853
Sung Rok, what would be your choice?

1294
00:50:03.053 --> 00:50:04.221
My choice would be number 4.

1295
00:50:04.521 --> 00:50:05.656
- Right? - That's right.

1296
00:50:05.656 --> 00:50:08.592
I have an idea. Ji Hyo doesn't like number 4.

1297
00:50:08.592 --> 00:50:10.560
She likes it when men are honest. Please act out the situation.

1298
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.695
- Give it a go. - All right.

1299
00:50:12.095 --> 00:50:13.530
Ji Hyo, ask him the question.

1300
00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:15.932
Sung Rok, how many women have you dated?

1301
00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.601
- Me? - Yes.

1302
00:50:17.634 --> 00:50:18.969
You are the first one.

1303
00:50:20.504 --> 00:50:21.571
Don't lie.

1304
00:50:21.571 --> 00:50:24.675
(Slapping)

1305
00:50:25.342 --> 00:50:27.844
- Ji Hyo. - She looked him up and down.

1306
00:50:27.844 --> 00:50:29.212
- Ji Hyo. - The thing is,

1307
00:50:29.212 --> 00:50:32.482
he didn't look confident when he said that.

1308
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:37.054
(Despite the perfect line, his eyes couldn't hide the truth.)

1309
00:50:37.054 --> 00:50:38.989
(Shifting)

1310
00:50:39.556 --> 00:50:41.325
Ji Hyo is a professional.

1311
00:50:41.692 --> 00:50:43.093
Ji Hyo is a professional.

1312
00:50:43.694 --> 00:50:45.062
This time,

1313
00:50:45.295 --> 00:50:47.431
the ones with the same style will act out a situation.

1314
00:50:47.464 --> 00:50:49.032
Why don't Sung Rok and So Min give it a go?

1315
00:50:49.032 --> 00:50:50.801
Both of you chose the same answer.

1316
00:50:50.801 --> 00:50:52.402
- Give it a go. - Okay.

1317
00:50:52.402 --> 00:50:54.504
It's not a bad answer if you love the woman very much.

1318
00:50:54.805 --> 00:50:57.040
How many women have you dated?

1319
00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.176
Me? You are the first one.

1320
00:50:59.276 --> 00:51:01.044
- Am I really the first one? - Yes.

1321
00:51:01.445 --> 00:51:03.380
Then why are you such a good kisser?

1322
00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:07.250
(Then why are you such a good kisser?)

1323
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:08.985
She began to investigate.

1324
00:51:08.985 --> 00:51:10.620
There are women who begin to investigate.

1325
00:51:10.654 --> 00:51:12.656
- I mean... - What do you think you are doing?

1326
00:51:12.656 --> 00:51:14.324
Why did you ask him that?

1327
00:51:14.324 --> 00:51:15.826
- She is ridiculous. - This is crazy.

1328
00:51:15.926 --> 00:51:17.594
What do you think you are doing?

1329
00:51:17.694 --> 00:51:18.795
Seriously.

1330
00:51:18.795 --> 00:51:19.963
Are you an investigator?

1331
00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:21.865
Are you an investigator?

1332
00:51:22.032 --> 00:51:25.235
She is like a prosecutor.

1333
00:51:25.402 --> 00:51:27.003
Are you a prosecutor?

1334
00:51:27.404 --> 00:51:28.672
What is wrong with her?

1335
00:51:28.672 --> 00:51:32.442
I want Jae Seok and So Min to give it a go.

1336
00:51:32.442 --> 00:51:34.945
- Me? - He always says he is an expert.

1337
00:51:35.178 --> 00:51:37.381
He always gives advice to Kwang Soo.

1338
00:51:37.614 --> 00:51:39.883
As everyone knows, I am Kwang Soo's relationship coach.

1339
00:51:40.384 --> 00:51:42.753
To be honest, this happened once.

1340
00:51:42.953 --> 00:51:45.021
There was a time a woman dated my body...

1341
00:51:45.155 --> 00:51:46.823
and Jae Seok's mind.

1342
00:51:46.823 --> 00:51:49.259
(This is an experience I had.)

1343
00:51:49.426 --> 00:51:50.827
Were you okay with that?

1344
00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:52.763
- He is my relationship coach. - I coach him...

1345
00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:54.531
with precision.

1346
00:51:54.731 --> 00:51:56.600
I point out the important parts. Let's go, So Min.

1347
00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.734
Here comes the prosecutor.

1348
00:51:57.734 --> 00:51:58.969
(The expert of interrogation)

1349
00:51:58.969 --> 00:52:00.070
- Okay. - She is an investigator.

1350
00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.571
(The relationship prosecutor, So Min)

1351
00:52:01.805 --> 00:52:03.006
Here comes the prosecutor.

1352
00:52:03.006 --> 00:52:04.040
(Interesting)

1353
00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.575
She is a prosecutor. She is an investigator.

1354
00:52:05.942 --> 00:52:07.711
I am not an easy target.

1355
00:52:07.711 --> 00:52:11.581
(The fierce melodrama unfolds.)

1356
00:52:11.681 --> 00:52:13.250
- I am not an easy target. - Jae Seok.

1357
00:52:13.784 --> 00:52:15.986
Have many women have you dated?

1358
00:52:15.986 --> 00:52:17.421
My goodness.

1359
00:52:17.921 --> 00:52:19.623
- Don't you know what I am like? - No.

1360
00:52:19.756 --> 00:52:22.592
You are my first and last love.

1361
00:52:22.793 --> 00:52:25.595
How is that possible? You are very old.

1362
00:52:25.595 --> 00:52:26.930
I need to focus on the road.

1363
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:29.099
(Let's have a conversation later.)

1364
00:52:29.332 --> 00:52:31.868
- What was that? - Jae Seok.

1365
00:52:32.002 --> 00:52:33.804
Are you in Japan? Why are you on the right side?

1366
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:35.806
Why are you on the right side?

1367
00:52:35.806 --> 00:52:37.340
Did you go to Japan?

1368
00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.775
- You are on the right side. - Right now,

1369
00:52:38.842 --> 00:52:41.111
- we are in Okinawa. - Okinawa.

1370
00:52:41.111 --> 00:52:43.880
- We are in Okinawa. - Okay.

1371
00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.784
Am I the first woman who came here with you?

1372
00:52:47.784 --> 00:52:49.653
(She begins her investigation.)

1373
00:52:49.653 --> 00:52:51.221
(The relationship expert seems to be flustered.)

1374
00:52:51.221 --> 00:52:52.556
I can't stop laughing.

1375
00:52:52.556 --> 00:52:55.559
- I am the first woman, right? - I can't stop laughing.

1376
00:52:55.559 --> 00:52:57.093
(The relationship expert seems to be flustered.)

1377
00:52:57.694 --> 00:52:58.862
Wait a minute.

1378
00:52:58.862 --> 00:53:02.732
(Prosecutor, wait a minute.)

1379
00:53:02.732 --> 00:53:03.733
Hey.

1380
00:53:03.733 --> 00:53:06.303
- Did you swear at your girlfriend? - It means "Wait a minute."

1381
00:53:06.303 --> 00:53:08.171
- Since I am in Japan, - That's right.

1382
00:53:08.171 --> 00:53:12.442
- I am learning Japanese. - Okay.

1383
00:53:12.442 --> 00:53:13.577
You know this, right?

1384
00:53:13.577 --> 00:53:15.946
I don't share my heart with another easily.

1385
00:53:15.946 --> 00:53:18.114
- Not even in elementary school? - Of course I didn't.

1386
00:53:18.114 --> 00:53:20.150
- What about in middle school? - I had a few blind dates.

1387
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:21.985
Look at his face. Of course he didn't.

1388
00:53:21.985 --> 00:53:25.322
(Look at his face. Of course he didn't.)

1389
00:53:25.889 --> 00:53:27.557
Look at your boyfriend's face.

1390
00:53:28.325 --> 00:53:31.528
It doesn't make sense that you don't believe him.

1391
00:53:31.528 --> 00:53:33.029
Believe him.

1392
00:53:33.029 --> 00:53:35.365
- Don't you feel bad for him? - Look at his face.

1393
00:53:35.365 --> 00:53:37.000
- Look at his face. - Do you really think he is lying?

1394
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.101
For goodness' sake.

1395
00:53:38.101 --> 00:53:40.403
- You should believe him. - This is driving me crazy.

1396
00:53:40.403 --> 00:53:42.305
- Look at his face. - This is driving me crazy.

1397
00:53:42.672 --> 00:53:44.841
A lot of people are cool.

1398
00:53:44.841 --> 00:53:46.276
These days,

1399
00:53:46.276 --> 00:53:48.912
it's better to be confident and cool.

1400
00:53:49.846 --> 00:53:52.215
Your answer should match the atmosphere and situation.

1401
00:53:52.449 --> 00:53:53.783
There is no right answer.

1402
00:53:53.783 --> 00:53:56.253
- There is no right answer in love. - Talking about first love...

1403
00:53:56.253 --> 00:53:57.320
Write it down.

1404
00:53:57.521 --> 00:54:00.190
Write it down. "There is no right answer in love."

1405
00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:02.692
- It's nothing impressive. - Remember my words.

1406
00:54:02.692 --> 00:54:04.594
This is Yu Jae Seok's relationship notebook.

1407
00:54:04.594 --> 00:54:07.030
"There is no right answer in love."

1408
00:54:09.232 --> 00:54:12.969
(Women answer the third question.)

1409
00:54:13.036 --> 00:54:15.071
(The stacking involves dirty moves such as a low kick and dragging.)

1410
00:54:15.071 --> 00:54:16.506
It's over.

1411
00:54:17.173 --> 00:54:18.575
The answer is number 4.

1412
00:54:18.575 --> 00:54:22.612
(Team Green wins Temperature of Love Questionnaire.)

1413
00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:24.981
The three members of Team Green, please come forward.

1414
00:54:24.981 --> 00:54:26.349
(Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, and Sung Rok have the chance to watch the hint video.)

1415
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:28.552
They will watch the video at the same time.

1416
00:54:30.754 --> 00:54:35.425
(What kind of a hint does the video contain?)

1417
00:54:37.294 --> 00:54:39.663
Aren't you hungry? Shall we order something?

1418
00:54:40.797 --> 00:54:43.099
It's already late. What shall we eat?

1419
00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.402
- Shall we eat jjajangmyeon? - My choice is jjajangmyeon too.

1420
00:54:46.136 --> 00:54:47.504
What would you like?

1421
00:54:47.804 --> 00:54:49.172
I like jjajangmyeon too.

1422
00:54:49.573 --> 00:54:52.075
Please order jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon.

1423
00:54:52.075 --> 00:54:54.010
(Everyone likes jjajangmyeon.)

1424
00:54:54.344 --> 00:54:55.345
This is...

1425
00:54:56.346 --> 00:54:57.714
This is very telling.

1426
00:54:57.714 --> 00:54:59.349
(What?)

1427
00:54:59.883 --> 00:55:01.551
(Before they played a game, they ordered food together.)

1428
00:55:02.485 --> 00:55:06.389
(Se Chan ordered jjajangmyeon to share with So Min.)

1429
00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:12.529
(Sung Rok, Bo Mi, and Seok Jin also ordered jjajangmyeon.)

(Are the assistants among these four members?)

1431
00:55:16.633 --> 00:55:17.968
This is very telling.

1432
00:55:18.301 --> 00:55:19.636
Isn't this too telling?

1433
00:55:19.636 --> 00:55:20.904
This is very telling.

1434
00:55:21.171 --> 00:55:23.073
- It must be a helpful hint. - Did you watch the video?

1435
00:55:23.073 --> 00:55:24.574
(Why are they so surprised?)

1436
00:55:25.175 --> 00:55:26.276
Okay.

1437
00:55:26.276 --> 00:55:29.412
(Let's see if they succeed in apprehending the assistants.)

1438

(Final Mission)

1439
00:55:31.114 --> 00:55:34.351
The final mission in the Half and Half Tour Pass Race...

1440
00:55:34.517 --> 00:55:36.119
is called Death Signal.

1441
00:55:36.119 --> 00:55:39.389
(Death Signal)

1442
00:55:40.357 --> 00:55:45.128
USB sticks with hint videos in them are hidden in this building.

1443
00:55:45.428 --> 00:55:46.896
- USB sticks? - Hint videos?

1444
00:55:47.063 --> 00:55:50.367
You have to guess who the assistants are...

1445
00:55:50.967 --> 00:55:54.604
and report using 1 of the 2 hidden walkie-talkies.

1446
00:55:54.971 --> 00:55:57.107
You're given only one chance to report,

1447
00:55:57.474 --> 00:56:00.343
and the race will end when the assistants are arrested.

1448
00:56:00.343 --> 00:56:01.645
(That means Kwang Soo and his assistants have lost.)

1449
00:56:01.645 --> 00:56:03.947
When your report turns out to be false,

1450
00:56:03.947 --> 00:56:07.817
you will be eliminated immediately. So be careful when you do.

1451
00:56:08.451 --> 00:56:12.555
One of the assistants is here. We don't have to do all that.

1452
00:56:12.555 --> 00:56:15.158
(This is really the last stage.)

1453
00:56:15.158 --> 00:56:19.295
Assistants can eliminate others by removing their name tags.

1454
00:56:19.295 --> 00:56:21.064
- Pardon? - Only the assistants...

1455
00:56:21.064 --> 00:56:23.133
can do that.

1456
00:56:23.133 --> 00:56:24.401
- We have to run. - Really?

1457
00:56:24.434 --> 00:56:27.037
If everyone is eliminated before the assistants are arrested,

1458
00:56:27.037 --> 00:56:28.905
Kwang Soo will win the right...

1459
00:56:29.039 --> 00:56:31.474
to choose two people to follow him to Australia.

1460
00:56:31.474 --> 00:56:32.475
(Kwang Soo can bring 2 more people.)

1461
00:56:32.475 --> 00:56:33.543
That's big.

1462
00:56:33.543 --> 00:56:35.779
(Kwang Soo can bring 2 more people.)

1463
00:56:36.212 --> 00:56:38.915
If the assistants are arrested,

1464
00:56:39.516 --> 00:56:43.219
the surviving members will not be going to Australia.

1465
00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:46.489
Two of the eliminated members will be going.

1466
00:56:46.489 --> 00:56:48.692
All the surviving members will be excluded?

1467
00:56:48.692 --> 00:56:49.693
Yes.

1468
00:56:49.693 --> 00:56:52.595
(Then the assistants should do a good job.)

1469
00:56:52.595 --> 00:56:54.864
(Restless)

1470
00:56:55.298 --> 00:56:58.068
(Look at Seok Jin.)

1471
00:57:00.136 --> 00:57:04.607
Seok Jin must have lost focus at some point.

1472
00:57:04.607 --> 00:57:06.209
- Why? - He probably gave up.

1473
00:57:06.443 --> 00:57:08.978
He suddenly started to do this.

1474
00:57:09.379 --> 00:57:12.782
And he started practicing with Bo Mi's name tag.

1475
00:57:12.916 --> 00:57:14.350
- Don't say that. - Stop it.

1476
00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:15.418
Don't say that.

1477
00:57:15.418 --> 00:57:18.221
- It's so obvious. - Stop it.

1478
00:57:18.221 --> 00:57:20.356
- You're so mean. - Think whatever you want.

1479
00:57:20.457 --> 00:57:22.792
Think whatever you want, but don't forget.

1480
00:57:22.792 --> 00:57:24.561
You'll be paying for it.

1481
00:57:24.594 --> 00:57:28.865
Please go to your positions so we can start the race.

1482
00:57:28.865 --> 00:57:30.033
- Okay. - Let's go.

1483
00:57:30.033 --> 00:57:33.203
(They move to their starting positions.)

1484
00:57:35.105 --> 00:57:36.773
We can only report using the walkie-talkies,

1485
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.908
and only assistants can remove name tags?

1486
00:57:38.908 --> 00:57:40.343
(Sung Rok is still trying to understand the rules.)

1487
00:57:40.877 --> 00:57:42.812
Haha, who do you think...

1488
00:57:43.546 --> 00:57:45.515
are assistants?

1489
00:57:45.915 --> 00:57:48.752
- Hey. - I know too, but...

1490
00:57:48.752 --> 00:57:51.688
My guess is Sung Rok...

1491
00:57:51.688 --> 00:57:53.623
and Seok Jin.

1492
00:57:54.457 --> 00:57:55.458
- Really? - Yes.

1493
00:57:55.925 --> 00:57:56.960
Where are you going?

1494
00:57:57.594 --> 00:57:58.862
- Where are you going? - Seok Jin.

1495
00:57:58.862 --> 00:58:01.131
You'll be here? Okay.

1496
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:02.432
I'll come back to get you.

1497
00:58:02.932 --> 00:58:04.567
I'll remove your name tag.

1498
00:58:04.567 --> 00:58:06.169
(What?)

1499
00:58:06.169 --> 00:58:07.937
(Remove his name tag?)

1500
00:58:07.937 --> 00:58:09.873
Only assistants can remove name tags.

1501
00:58:09.873 --> 00:58:11.641
Are you saying you're an assistant?

1502
00:58:11.674 --> 00:58:13.109
I'm just saying.

1503
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:16.746
(Is he really an assistant who is just a bit clumsy?)

1504
00:58:17.413 --> 00:58:20.784
I'm sure Seok Jin and Se Chan are assistants.

1505
00:58:21.518 --> 00:58:22.919
Yes, Se Chan.

1506
00:58:24.154 --> 00:58:27.357
The way he spoke in that video was too obvious.

1507
00:58:27.357 --> 00:58:29.159
I'm sure.

1508
00:58:29.159 --> 00:58:33.062
(Although the voice was disguised,)

1509
00:58:33.062 --> 00:58:37.066
(judging from the way he spoke, was it Se Chan?)

1510
00:58:38.168 --> 00:58:40.303
Se Chan usually speak that way.

1511
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:42.672
He speaks quite fast.

1512
00:58:45.074 --> 00:58:46.342
What will Seok Jin do?

1513
00:58:47.544 --> 00:58:48.545
I feel so sorry for him.

1514
00:58:50.213 --> 00:58:52.615
Dear assistants,

1515
00:58:55.318 --> 00:58:56.853
you must love jjajangmyeon.

1516
00:58:56.853 --> 00:58:58.054
(She means something by it.)

1517
00:58:59.255 --> 00:59:00.857
I think I know who you are.

1518
00:59:02.058 --> 00:59:04.661
Seok Jin and Bo Mi.

1519
00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:05.795
(Her guess)

1520
00:59:05.795 --> 00:59:08.932
(Assistants love jjajangmyeon.)

1521
00:59:08.932 --> 00:59:10.667
(Who are...)

1522
00:59:10.667 --> 00:59:12.769
(Kwang Soo's assistants?)

1523
00:59:13.503 --> 00:59:15.505
The race will start soon. 10,

1524
00:59:16.306 --> 00:59:18.474
- 9, 8... - I'm bad at finding things.

1525
00:59:18.474 --> 00:59:19.542
(They have to report assistants.)

1526
00:59:19.542 --> 00:59:20.743
7, 6...

1527
00:59:20.743 --> 00:59:24.948
(If they report the wrong person, they'll be eliminated.)

1528
00:59:24.981 --> 00:59:27.951
(Who will survive to the end?)

1529
00:59:28.251 --> 00:59:29.252
The race starts now.

1530
00:59:29.752 --> 00:59:30.753
Here we go.

1531
00:59:32.255 --> 00:59:33.356
The race starts now.

1532
00:59:33.356 --> 00:59:35.491
(The race starts.)

1533
00:59:36.759 --> 00:59:40.330
I have to find USB sticks first.

1534
00:59:40.663 --> 00:59:41.865
(They have to find out who the assistants are.)

1535
00:59:41.865 --> 00:59:43.900
There might be one around here.

1536
00:59:44.634 --> 00:59:47.303
(Nervous)

1537
00:59:50.173 --> 00:59:51.174
Gosh, I'm scared.

1538
00:59:53.042 --> 00:59:55.912
(She usually gets eliminated this way.)

1539
00:59:57.914 --> 01:00:00.950
(If I can find USB sticks...)

1540
01:00:05.455 --> 01:00:07.724
(Kwang Soo is following him.)

1541
01:00:08.858 --> 01:00:11.661
(Kwang Soo suddenly...)

1542
01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:13.663
(runs to him.)

1543
01:00:13.663 --> 01:00:14.731
(Approaching)

1544
01:00:17.267 --> 01:00:18.268
Gosh.

1545
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:22.805
(What is he doing?)

1546
01:00:22.805 --> 01:00:24.474
What are you doing?

1547
01:00:24.607 --> 01:00:26.809
- I'm just wandering around. - Kwang Soo.

1548
01:00:28.144 --> 01:00:29.913
All right. Anyway...

1549
01:00:30.046 --> 01:00:31.247
Kwang Soo. What are you doing?

1550
01:00:31.848 --> 01:00:32.849
What's going on?

1551
01:00:32.849 --> 01:00:34.417
(You two look suspicious.)

1552
01:00:34.417 --> 01:00:35.551
(Kwang Soo disappears.)

1553
01:00:35.551 --> 01:00:37.654
Hey.

1554
01:00:38.154 --> 01:00:41.157
He's just trying to make me look suspicious.

1555
01:00:41.891 --> 01:00:44.594
Gosh, I can't believe Kwang Soo.

1556
01:00:44.594 --> 01:00:45.795
Come here.

1557
01:00:46.396 --> 01:00:48.898
(So Min searches the convenience store.)

1558
01:00:49.699 --> 01:00:52.001
Hello. Have you seen USB sticks?

1559
01:00:52.435 --> 01:00:54.704
- No. - Didn't anyone hide anything here?

1560
01:00:54.771 --> 01:00:55.772
No.

1561
01:00:55.772 --> 01:00:56.940
Didn't anyone come here?

1562
01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.075
No. We don't carry USB sticks.

1563
01:00:59.075 --> 01:01:01.377
Didn't anyone leave any boxes here?

1564
01:01:02.245 --> 01:01:03.279
No.

1565
01:01:03.846 --> 01:01:06.549
(There must be one here.)

1566
01:01:09.719 --> 01:01:11.554
Unbelievable.

1567
01:01:12.155 --> 01:01:15.758
(So Min finds hint number 1.)

1568
01:01:15.758 --> 01:01:19.395
(Each USB stick has a different hint.)

1569
01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:23.032
(Careful)

1570
01:01:25.568 --> 01:01:26.569
It's playing.

1571
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:30.073
- Should we order something? - What about jjajangmyeon?

1572
01:01:30.073 --> 01:01:32.709
- I want jjajangmyeon too. - Me too.

1573
01:01:32.942 --> 01:01:35.478
Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon, please.

1574
01:01:36.145 --> 01:01:39.682
(So Min now knows assistants like jjajangmyeon.)

1575
01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:42.518
Some of us ordered jjajangmyeon today.

1576
01:01:44.287 --> 01:01:47.523
(In addition to Se Chan and Seok Jin,)

1577
01:01:47.523 --> 01:01:51.127
(Sung Rok, Kwang Soo, and Bo Mi had jjajangmyeon.)

1578
01:01:51.694 --> 01:01:53.329
(This is very helpful.)

1579
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:55.531
- Some people ordered jjajangmyeon. - So Min.

1580
01:01:56.866 --> 01:01:59.669
- Hey. - Did you watch a hint video?

1581
01:01:59.669 --> 01:02:00.670
No.

1582
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:01.738
(She didn't even hesitate.)

1583
01:02:02.238 --> 01:02:05.108
I saw you taking off the earphones.

1584
01:02:05.274 --> 01:02:07.710
You lie all the time.

1585
01:02:07.844 --> 01:02:09.412
You're scary.

1586
01:02:09.412 --> 01:02:10.713
- That's not true. - Forget it.

1587
01:02:11.447 --> 01:02:13.082
Ji Hyo, I'll tell you something.

1588
01:02:13.516 --> 01:02:16.052
Who likes jjajangmyeon?

1589
01:02:18.488 --> 01:02:20.256
Jae Seok? Se Chan?

1590
01:02:20.656 --> 01:02:22.759
Se Chan said, "I'll definitely order a jjajangmyeon."

1591
01:02:22.759 --> 01:02:23.960
(I'm sure it's Se Chan.)

1592
01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:24.961
It's Se Chan.

1593
01:02:25.061 --> 01:02:27.563
Who ordered jjajangmyeon except Se Chan and Seok Jin?

1594
01:02:27.964 --> 01:02:28.965
Who were they?

1595
01:02:28.965 --> 01:02:29.966
(Se Chan and Seok Jin are suspicious.)

1596
01:02:30.967 --> 01:02:32.468
(Meanwhile...)

1597
01:02:32.468 --> 01:02:33.536
Bo Mi.

1598
01:02:35.071 --> 01:02:36.806
Hi.

1599
01:02:36.806 --> 01:02:40.676
(Se Chan, Bo Mi, and Seok Jin run into each other.)

1600
01:02:40.676 --> 01:02:42.445
(They all had jjajangmyeon.)

1601
01:02:42.445 --> 01:02:44.113
Is that Se Chan? Se Chan.

1602
01:02:44.213 --> 01:02:46.382
Yes? It's Seok Jin.

1603
01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:49.252
It's Seok Jin. Run.

1604
01:02:50.219 --> 01:02:51.854
(Running)

1605
01:02:53.056 --> 01:02:54.323
(Hurrying)

1606
01:02:54.323 --> 01:02:55.558
It's Seok Jin.

1607
01:02:55.558 --> 01:02:56.559
(Is he gone?)

1608
01:02:58.561 --> 01:02:59.662
(Sneaking)

1609
01:03:03.966 --> 01:03:07.203
(She found a USB stick.)

1610
01:03:10.039 --> 01:03:11.808
Unbelievable.

1611
01:03:13.376 --> 01:03:16.245
(She finds a laptop too.)

1612
01:03:16.245 --> 01:03:17.246
I can do this.

1613
01:03:17.246 --> 01:03:18.848
(She finds a laptop too.)

1614
01:03:20.049 --> 01:03:21.050
Finally, I get to watch it.

1615
01:03:21.651 --> 01:03:23.920
Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon, please.

1616
01:03:24.854 --> 01:03:27.557
(The hint is jjajangmyeon?)

1617
01:03:27.557 --> 01:03:29.625
(Noise)

1618
01:03:31.561 --> 01:03:33.529
(Someone is coming.)

1619
01:03:35.064 --> 01:03:36.265
Someone watched a video here.

1620
01:03:38.935 --> 01:03:40.002
Unbelievable.

1621
01:03:42.538 --> 01:03:43.539
Wait.

1622
01:03:43.539 --> 01:03:45.641
(Who is coming?)

1623
01:03:48.311 --> 01:03:49.312
Who is it?

1624
01:03:51.114 --> 01:03:53.783
(The sound is getting near.)

1625
01:03:53.783 --> 01:03:57.053
(Who is chasing Bo Mi?)

1626
01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.323
(An assistant?)

1627
01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:03.759
Please lock the door.

1628
01:04:04.427 --> 01:04:06.762
They like jjajangmyeon.

1629
01:04:06.762 --> 01:04:08.264
(Hold on)

1630
01:04:08.264 --> 01:04:10.166
Unbelievable. They like jjajangmyeon.

1631
01:04:10.166 --> 01:04:11.267
Who ordered jjajangmyeon?

1632
01:04:13.469 --> 01:04:14.937
Se Chan and Seok Jin...

1633
01:04:16.139 --> 01:04:17.173
It must be them.

1634
01:04:19.041 --> 01:04:23.412
(Se Chan and Seok Jin had jjajangmyeon.)

1635
01:04:24.013 --> 01:04:28.050
(Se Chan?)

1636
01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:30.920
(Seok Jin?)

1637
01:04:34.524 --> 01:04:36.392
(Peeking)

1638
01:04:37.593 --> 01:04:41.097
(Someone is approaching.)

1639
01:04:43.799 --> 01:04:45.101
(Rattling)

1640
01:04:46.235 --> 01:04:48.871
(Come on, Bo Mi.)

1641
01:04:55.478 --> 01:04:57.113
(Wait)

1642
01:04:57.113 --> 01:04:58.481
(Kwang Soo?)

1643
01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:01.050
(It's me.)

1644
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:02.885
Hold on.

1645
01:05:02.885 --> 01:05:04.654
Kwang Soo,

1646
01:05:04.787 --> 01:05:05.955
hold on.

1647
01:05:05.955 --> 01:05:07.890
You can't rip my name tag off.

1648
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:11.227
- You can't, right? - I can't.

1649
01:05:11.227 --> 01:05:14.463
(Only the assistants can rip it off.)

1650
01:05:16.165 --> 01:05:19.335
(There's a dark shadow that's approaching them.)

1651
01:05:19.468 --> 01:05:20.937
Please save me just this once.

1652
01:05:21.304 --> 01:05:23.172
Please.

1653
01:05:24.407 --> 01:05:25.708
- Hurry. - Why?

1654
01:05:25.708 --> 01:05:26.776
Bo Mi.

1655
01:05:28.611 --> 01:05:30.046
Hold on.

1656
01:05:31.647 --> 01:05:33.182
(Shrieking)

1657
01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:35.685
Hey.

1658
01:05:36.285 --> 01:05:37.420
Where were you?

1659
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:39.355
(The assistant has appeared.)

1660
01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:41.490
(Bo Mi is eliminated.)

1661
01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:44.627
Bo Mi is eliminated.

1662
01:05:46.128 --> 01:05:47.129
(They're shocked by the news.)

1663
01:05:47.129 --> 01:05:48.965
What now? I'm scared.

1664
01:05:49.298 --> 01:05:50.433
If I get eliminated,

1665
01:05:51.234 --> 01:05:52.435
I can't even talk.

1666
01:05:53.102 --> 01:05:54.870
The assistant started moving.

1667
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:57.173
(He's shocked.)

1668
01:06:02.078 --> 01:06:04.146
Is there anything up there? I can go up, right?

1669
01:06:04.146 --> 01:06:05.715
(The assistant did his first job.)

1670
01:06:05.948 --> 01:06:10.119
(Who will the next target be?)

1671
01:06:11.287 --> 01:06:12.288
Kwang Soo.

1672
01:06:13.389 --> 01:06:14.390
Come here.

1673
01:06:18.828 --> 01:06:20.029
There's nobody, right?

1674
01:06:22.031 --> 01:06:26.302
And the other person was a woman. It was a woman's neck.

1675
01:06:26.302 --> 01:06:27.470
(These two share information on the assistant.)

1676
01:06:29.138 --> 01:06:30.339
Who can rip mine off?

1677
01:06:30.339 --> 01:06:33.709
(They see Seok Jin and Kwang Soo together.)

1678
01:06:33.809 --> 01:06:35.511
(I'm 200 percent sure the assistant is Seok Jin.)

1679
01:06:35.678 --> 01:06:37.013
Come here, So Min.

1680
01:06:38.347 --> 01:06:40.783
(Let's get away and look for more hints.)

1681
01:06:41.284 --> 01:06:43.119
Where's the laptop?

1682
01:06:43.119 --> 01:06:45.554
(Jong Kook is also looking for more hints.)

1683
01:06:45.554 --> 01:06:48.157
(What's this?)

1684
01:06:48.924 --> 01:06:51.294
It's so obvious.

1685
01:06:52.728 --> 01:06:56.132
(Sung Rok finds a USB too.)

1686
01:06:56.132 --> 01:06:57.600
I got it.

1687
01:06:59.235 --> 01:07:00.870
(Hint video 7)

1688
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:01.904
Okay.

1689
01:07:03.339 --> 01:07:07.076
A crocodile cage? Why do people have to go in there?

1690
01:07:07.209 --> 01:07:09.545
I can't even imagine it. I'm so scared.

1691
01:07:14.984 --> 01:07:16.786
The assistant has a mole. Wait...

1692
01:07:18.654 --> 01:07:19.955
(He has a mole on the back of his neck.)

1693
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:23.159
I'll never do it. I'm frightened of crocodiles.

1694
01:07:23.793 --> 01:07:25.161
We are normal.

1695
01:07:26.662 --> 01:07:30.299
(They are all cowards.)

1696
01:07:30.299 --> 01:07:31.734
One person has a mole on the back of his neck.

1697
01:07:32.535 --> 01:07:36.172
Hair is shaved at the back, so it must be a male.

1698
01:07:38.674 --> 01:07:39.709
The assistant...

1699
01:07:42.712 --> 01:07:45.548
(It's somebody who has a mole on his neck and is a coward.)

1700
01:07:46.782 --> 01:07:49.118
People keep running away from me.

1701
01:07:51.287 --> 01:07:52.555
(Is Seok Jin the assistant because Kwang Soo keeps on following him?)

1702
01:07:52.555 --> 01:07:54.990
Unless somebody calls and eliminates you...

1703
01:07:56.559 --> 01:07:57.827
I have to go on the other side.

1704
01:07:57.827 --> 01:08:00.363
(Se Chan looks quite busy too.)

1705
01:08:00.996 --> 01:08:01.997
Let's see.

1706
01:08:01.997 --> 01:08:05.501
(Jae Seok is hiding and checking his hint.)

1707
01:08:06.736 --> 01:08:08.904
I'm pretty worried.

1708
01:08:09.071 --> 01:08:12.174
I'm usually not very lucky.

1709
01:08:12.508 --> 01:08:15.111
I'm not that lucky either.

1710
01:08:16.278 --> 01:08:18.047
Should we perform an exorcism?

1711
01:08:19.648 --> 01:08:21.584
(Thinking)

1712
01:08:21.584 --> 01:08:23.919
(What is that watch?)

1713
01:08:25.054 --> 01:08:27.723
Jae Seok, please tell me. Is it somebody unexpected?

1714
01:08:28.691 --> 01:08:31.060
Jae Seok, we have to know so that we can work together.

1715
01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.361
- Exactly. - Right?

1716
01:08:33.162 --> 01:08:35.064
What's so shocking about it?

1717
01:08:35.064 --> 01:08:36.132
Hold on.

1718
01:08:36.799 --> 01:08:38.434
Is it not somebody you thought it was?

1719
01:08:38.601 --> 01:08:40.002
I'll share my hint.

1720
01:08:40.002 --> 01:08:41.771
Please tell us.

1721
01:08:41.771 --> 01:08:43.839
(He considers Haha's suggestion.)

1722
01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:46.342
No, I need to think about this.

1723
01:08:47.576 --> 01:08:48.644
Boss.

1724
01:08:49.445 --> 01:08:51.547
We made you win...

1725
01:08:51.814 --> 01:08:53.149
in Japan.

1726
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:54.850
You are our king.

1727
01:08:55.217 --> 01:08:56.318
You are our boss.

1728
01:08:58.954 --> 01:09:02.224
(The 1st Place Tour in Osaka during the summer)

1729
01:09:02.224 --> 01:09:07.263
(Haha and So Min pledged allegiance to Jae Seok.)

1730
01:09:09.031 --> 01:09:13.436
(King Grasshopper, please pity us.)

1731
01:09:13.436 --> 01:09:14.703
I am...

1732
01:09:16.138 --> 01:09:18.841
really sorry but please leave.

1733
01:09:18.941 --> 01:09:20.309
Jae Seok.

1734
01:09:20.676 --> 01:09:22.111
(It didn't work.)

1735
01:09:22.111 --> 01:09:24.113
- Tell me the name. - I have to think about this.

1736
01:09:24.113 --> 01:09:25.681
- Tell us this. - Look at this.

1737
01:09:25.881 --> 01:09:29.585
(The new hint...)

1738
01:09:29.585 --> 01:09:31.554
(is this watch.)

1739
01:09:33.222 --> 01:09:34.657
(At the same time)

1740
01:09:35.591 --> 01:09:42.264
(Everybody is busy looking for hints.)

1741
01:09:42.364 --> 01:09:44.934
You had seafood jjajangmyeon today, right?

1742
01:09:44.934 --> 01:09:46.535
- Yes. - Can you give me a hint?

1743
01:09:46.535 --> 01:09:47.703
(She's so random.)

1744
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:50.573
A hint? What does that have to do with eating jjajangmyeon?

1745
01:09:51.106 --> 01:09:52.875
I'll tell you one thing too.

1746
01:09:52.875 --> 01:09:53.876
- What is it? - A hint.

1747
01:09:53.876 --> 01:09:56.278
- Can you tell me? - Can you tell me something too?

1748
01:09:56.278 --> 01:10:00.282
(They are busy asking for each other's hint.)

1749
01:10:00.282 --> 01:10:03.052
(She's going to tell him a hint?)

1750
01:10:04.019 --> 01:10:05.287
You're the assistant, right?

1751
01:10:05.387 --> 01:10:06.589
- Me? - Yes.

1752
01:10:06.755 --> 01:10:08.290
You can report me and check.

1753
01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:09.458
(Se Chan pays attention to their conversation.)

1754
01:10:09.458 --> 01:10:10.593
I'm scared.

1755
01:10:11.327 --> 01:10:13.462
- I'm so scared. Se Chan. - What?

1756
01:10:13.462 --> 01:10:15.197
(He disappears when they're done talking.)

1757
01:10:15.197 --> 01:10:17.633
Did you get any hint?

1758
01:10:17.867 --> 01:10:19.702
No, I have nothing. He's scary.

1759
01:10:19.702 --> 01:10:21.871
- Are you going around together? - Sung Rok's eyes are scary.

1760
01:10:21.871 --> 01:10:23.105
(He disappears when they're done talking.)

1761
01:10:23.405 --> 01:10:27.510
(Is Se Chan really the assistant?)

1762
01:10:30.513 --> 01:10:32.481
This must be the set for "Temperature of Love".

1763
01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:34.250
(Temperature of Love)

1764
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:35.584
This is so nice.

1765
01:10:35.784 --> 01:10:37.319
I can't do this.

1766
01:10:37.553 --> 01:10:40.422
I have to work. Let's work first, So Min.

1767
01:10:40.556 --> 01:10:42.391
Let's work and come back another time.

1768
01:10:43.526 --> 01:10:46.962
I've never been here before. May I come in?

1769
01:10:47.663 --> 01:10:50.833
(Se Chan signals somebody.)

1770
01:10:55.604 --> 01:10:56.972
There's no way out.

1771
01:10:57.473 --> 01:10:59.174
Can I go this way to get to the main building?

1772
01:10:59.308 --> 01:11:01.610
You have to get out to go to the main building.

1773
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:04.346
- I think Seok Jin will be there. - You have to go back up.

1774
01:11:06.749 --> 01:11:08.851
No. Don't do this.

1775
01:11:09.351 --> 01:11:11.120
No way.

1776
01:11:11.854 --> 01:11:14.557
(Somebody is after So Min.)

1777
01:11:14.557 --> 01:11:15.558
No.

1778
01:11:15.858 --> 01:11:17.927
I'm going to lock it.

1779
01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.363
What do I do?

1780
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:23.966
This isn't right.

1781
01:11:23.966 --> 01:11:25.801
(Please save me.)

1782
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:26.835
My gosh.

1783
01:11:27.303 --> 01:11:29.171
My goodness. What do I do?

1784
01:11:29.171 --> 01:11:31.540
This isn't right. Don't do this.

1785
01:11:33.142 --> 01:11:35.978
I didn't know it'll end like this.

1786
01:11:35.978 --> 01:11:37.413
(Ripping sound)

1787
01:11:37.413 --> 01:11:41.350
So Min is eliminated.

1788
01:11:41.684 --> 01:11:43.319
So Min is eliminated.

1789
01:11:43.319 --> 01:11:45.955
(So Min is eliminated?)

1790
01:11:46.255 --> 01:11:47.456
Gosh.

1791
01:11:48.824 --> 01:11:49.892
I'm getting goose bumps.

1792
01:11:50.225 --> 01:11:51.527
I'm getting goose bumps.

1793
01:11:51.527 --> 01:11:52.861
(He doesn't know who the assistant is but he's frightened.)

1794
01:11:52.861 --> 01:11:55.030
There's a walkie-talkie.

1795
01:11:55.631 --> 01:11:59.835
(You get one chance to report the assistant.)

1796
01:11:59.835 --> 01:12:06.508
(If you get the wrong person, you are eliminated.)

1797
01:12:06.508 --> 01:12:08.577
(It's dangerous to report before you know who the assistant is.)

1798
01:12:08.577 --> 01:12:10.312
I've narrowed down,

1799
01:12:10.946 --> 01:12:12.281
but it's too early.

1800
01:12:16.452 --> 01:12:19.855
- Haha. - My gosh.

1801
01:12:22.391 --> 01:12:24.760
(He almost got a heart attack.)

1802
01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.161
This is not what I thought.

1803
01:12:26.161 --> 01:12:27.563
- Are you trying to get me? - No. Look.

1804
01:12:27.563 --> 01:12:29.031
Seok Jin...

1805
01:12:29.231 --> 01:12:32.167
Seok Jin didn't do anything...

1806
01:12:32.334 --> 01:12:34.336
- when Jae Seok was passing by. - Of course he would.

1807
01:12:34.336 --> 01:12:36.271
- Why? - So that he's not suspected.

1808
01:12:37.072 --> 01:12:38.607
Why did you look at my back?

1809
01:12:38.607 --> 01:12:39.942
- What do you mean? - Hey.

1810
01:12:39.942 --> 01:12:40.976
It's not me.

1811
01:12:41.076 --> 01:12:42.077
It's not me, Haha.

1812
01:12:42.177 --> 01:12:43.278
(Se Chan, you are a bit suspicious.)

1813
01:12:43.278 --> 01:12:44.580
- Hey. - Haha.

1814
01:12:46.882 --> 01:12:48.617
- Let's go look at it. - What is it? Do you have it?

1815
01:12:49.385 --> 01:12:50.586
Okay. Lead the way.

1816
01:12:50.853 --> 01:12:51.887
You lead the way.

1817
01:12:52.021 --> 01:12:54.023
Haha, we are going to the Nevis Swing together.

1818
01:12:54.223 --> 01:12:56.358
- Swing - All right.

1819
01:12:56.759 --> 01:12:58.761
- Later. - Okay.

1820
01:12:58.761 --> 01:12:59.895
Follow me.

1821
01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:02.865
- What? - Go first.

1822
01:13:03.165 --> 01:13:05.534
- Let's see it together. Please. - No.

1823
01:13:06.335 --> 01:13:07.336
I'll join you later.

1824
01:13:07.836 --> 01:13:08.904
I trust you.

1825
01:13:09.304 --> 01:13:11.106
- All right? - I trust you, Haha.

1826
01:13:11.106 --> 01:13:12.141
Trust me.

1827
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:16.145
(Something is fishy.)

1828
01:13:17.046 --> 01:13:18.714
Why aren't there any hints?

1829
01:13:18.714 --> 01:13:21.583
(Let me look for some hints.)

1830
01:13:25.487 --> 01:13:27.523
(Se Chan is lost. He's just looking for hints.)

1831
01:13:27.523 --> 01:13:29.158
There isn't any.

1832
01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.429
- Let's stop. - What?

1833
01:13:33.996 --> 01:13:35.197
Let's stop.

1834
01:13:35.964 --> 01:13:38.033
Let's stop.

1835
01:13:39.601 --> 01:13:42.137
(He was being suspected the whole time.)

1836
01:13:43.639 --> 01:13:44.840
Was it you?

1837
01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.841
Is it you?

1838
01:13:45.841 --> 01:13:46.909
(He's eliminated?)

1839
01:13:46.909 --> 01:13:48.744
What's this? What are you?

1840
01:13:51.447 --> 01:13:52.614
I'm the assistant.

1841
01:13:52.614 --> 01:13:53.782
(Se Chan is eliminated.)

1842
01:13:53.782 --> 01:13:54.917
You are?

1843
01:13:57.453 --> 01:14:00.923
- Se Chan is eliminated. - What?

1844
01:14:02.324 --> 01:14:03.792
Se Chan is eliminated?

1845
01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:07.329
(You are nothing special.)

1846
01:14:07.329 --> 01:14:08.397
I'm sorry.

1847
01:14:08.397 --> 01:14:10.833
(I'm sorry.)

1848
01:14:10.833 --> 01:14:11.867
Go.

1849
01:14:14.336 --> 01:14:15.404
Go to Australia.

1850
01:14:15.404 --> 01:14:17.406
(Go to Australia.)

1851
01:14:18.107 --> 01:14:19.108
Go.

1852
01:14:19.108 --> 01:14:21.677
(Am I going to see the crocodiles?)

1853
01:14:22.644 --> 01:14:24.480
I'm 100 percent sure that it's Seok Jin.

1854
01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.648
(With Se Chan being eliminated, there are not many candidates left.)

1855
01:14:26.648 --> 01:14:29.251
I got high-level information.

1856
01:14:29.618 --> 01:14:30.953
Ji Hyo covered her lips...

1857
01:14:30.953 --> 01:14:32.454
when she was talking about jjajangmyeon.

1858
01:14:32.454 --> 01:14:33.589
- Jjajangmyeon? - Yes.

1859
01:14:34.456 --> 01:14:36.558
(Jjajangmyeon?)

1860
01:14:36.558 --> 01:14:38.560
Okay. Got it.

1861
01:14:38.694 --> 01:14:40.729
I don't know anymore. I'm going to say it before I get eliminated.

1862
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:41.730
(I'll do what's necessary.)

1863
01:14:41.730 --> 01:14:42.798
Find the walkie-talkie, quick.

1864
01:14:43.665 --> 01:14:46.435
(However)

1865
01:14:46.435 --> 01:14:47.636
I have goose bumps.

1866
01:14:50.339 --> 01:14:53.809
He has a mole right at the end of his hairline.

1867
01:14:53.809 --> 01:14:55.611
(Haha has a mole on his neck?)

1868
01:14:57.446 --> 01:15:02.484
(In the hint video he saw,)

1869
01:15:02.484 --> 01:15:06.855
(somebody had a mole at the same position.)

1870
01:15:08.023 --> 01:15:11.026
(Is Haha the assistant?)

1871
01:15:12.828 --> 01:15:15.864
He has it at the end.

1872
01:15:18.767 --> 01:15:21.436
(He does...)

1873
01:15:21.436 --> 01:15:27.543
(have mole on his neck.)

1874
01:15:33.582 --> 01:15:35.884
It's Seok Jin, Sung Rok, or Haha?

1875
01:15:38.821 --> 01:15:40.088
Each person...

1876
01:15:41.824 --> 01:15:43.725
- Did you see the hint? - I did.

1877
01:15:44.359 --> 01:15:45.727
- Did you? - It's not you.

1878
01:15:45.894 --> 01:15:46.995
No, I...

1879
01:15:48.931 --> 01:15:50.833
(What?)

1880
01:15:50.833 --> 01:15:53.502
(What's this ringtone?)

1881
01:15:54.503 --> 01:15:56.605
(A few minutes ago)

1882
01:15:56.605 --> 01:16:00.042
Another positive fact...

1883
01:16:00.576 --> 01:16:03.712
is that many members are unlucky. It's not little.

1884
01:16:04.813 --> 01:16:07.416
- Excuse me. - Let's work together. Good luck.

1885
01:16:07.416 --> 01:16:08.951
(The ringtone rang in the hint video.)

1886
01:16:08.951 --> 01:16:10.652
I heard the ringtone in the video.

1887
01:16:12.421 --> 01:16:13.722
It was that tone.

1888
01:16:16.225 --> 01:16:19.027
(Seok Jin got attacked too.)

1889
01:16:19.027 --> 01:16:21.630
(Who is this assistant?)

1890
01:16:22.464 --> 01:16:23.732
(Ripping off)

1891
01:16:23.732 --> 01:16:25.467
Seok Jin is eliminated.

1892
01:16:25.467 --> 01:16:28.270
(Seok Jin, a strong candidate, is eliminated.)

1893
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:29.438
I get eliminated here.

1894
01:16:31.173 --> 01:16:34.943
(Five people are eliminated.)

1895
01:16:35.878 --> 01:16:37.012
Why are you here?

1896
01:16:37.946 --> 01:16:40.015
Stop lying.

1897
01:16:40.015 --> 01:16:41.583
- What? - Did you come here on purpose?

1898
01:16:41.583 --> 01:16:43.051
No, I'm eliminated.

1899
01:16:43.752 --> 01:16:46.221
- You are eliminated? - Did you ask another assistant?

1900
01:16:46.555 --> 01:16:48.290
- Hold on. - Let me see.

1901
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:49.524
I'm not an assistant.

1902
01:16:50.259 --> 01:16:53.829
Why were you acting strange today?

1903
01:16:53.829 --> 01:16:55.397
You did that to me.

1904
01:16:55.397 --> 01:16:57.933
I kept on denying it.

1905
01:16:58.767 --> 01:17:00.435
I kept on denying it.

1906
01:17:00.435 --> 01:17:01.603
(This is so unfair.)

1907
01:17:04.206 --> 01:17:05.841
Is it Se Chan? Se Chan.

1908
01:17:06.408 --> 01:17:09.077
(They ran away from him.)

1909
01:17:09.077 --> 01:17:13.582
(They ran away from him for no reason.)

1910
01:17:13.582 --> 01:17:15.984
(She ran away teasingly.)

1911
01:17:16.518 --> 01:17:20.923
(You guys have been running away from me all day.)

1912
01:17:22.891 --> 01:17:26.461
(Kwang Soo was following him.)

1913
01:17:26.762 --> 01:17:29.131
Go.

1914
01:17:29.197 --> 01:17:32.134
(He kept on coming back.)

1915
01:17:32.134 --> 01:17:36.338
(He handed over an empty box.)

1916
01:17:37.572 --> 01:17:43.111
(Ji Hyo saw it.)

1917
01:17:43.111 --> 01:17:45.514
(This is driving me nuts.)

1918
01:17:46.581 --> 01:17:48.050
(Is he really the assistant?)

1919
01:17:49.484 --> 01:17:52.020
(I'm not the assistant.)

1920
01:17:52.955 --> 01:17:54.189
I'm speechless.

1921
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:56.959
I've been suspected all day, and now I'm out.

1922
01:17:57.693 --> 01:18:00.062
- It's Haha. - I kept on denying it.

1923
01:18:00.062 --> 01:18:02.464
It's Haha.

1924
01:18:02.464 --> 01:18:03.765
I told you it's him.

1925
01:18:04.066 --> 01:18:05.233
- It's him. - It's Haha.

1926
01:18:05.233 --> 01:18:07.436
- It's Haha and... - It's him.

1927
01:18:07.436 --> 01:18:08.570
(Is Haha the assistant?)

1928
01:18:10.472 --> 01:18:12.374
Are you eliminated?

1929
01:18:12.474 --> 01:18:14.676
- He's here. - Hey, assistant.

1930
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:16.211
You're so it.

1931
01:18:16.211 --> 01:18:18.580
- The assistant? I'm eliminated too. - Really?

1932
01:18:20.349 --> 01:18:23.151
(Haha is eliminated?)

1933
01:18:24.252 --> 01:18:27.556
(5 minutes ago on rooftop of the annex)

1934
01:18:27.556 --> 01:18:32.894
(When you report the wrong person, you are out immediately.)

1935
01:18:32.894 --> 01:18:36.999
(Haha reported Seok Jin and Sung Rok.)

1936
01:18:38.066 --> 01:18:41.636
(I caught the assistants.)

1937
01:18:41.636 --> 01:18:44.840
Haha, you did not state the correct answer.

1938
01:18:45.374 --> 01:18:46.575
What?

1939
01:18:46.675 --> 01:18:49.745
Haha, you did not state the correct answer.

1940
01:18:49.811 --> 01:18:51.646
You are eliminated.

1941
01:18:51.646 --> 01:18:53.782
(Haha got eliminated for reporting the wrong people.)

1942
01:18:54.182 --> 01:18:55.817
I got confused...

1943
01:18:56.318 --> 01:18:59.588
and I remembered that Seok Jin had a mole on his neck.

1944
01:19:00.322 --> 01:19:04.926
But it's actually metallic poisoning, not a mole.

1945
01:19:07.596 --> 01:19:08.730
Metallic poisoning?

1946
01:19:09.464 --> 01:19:10.866
Do you wear necklaces?

1947
01:19:10.899 --> 01:19:13.168
- I don't. - You should wear gold.

1948
01:19:13.168 --> 01:19:15.737
They are cowards, right? And then?

1949
01:19:16.171 --> 01:19:18.440
- They like jjajangmyeon. - It's either Jong Kook or Jae Seok.

1950
01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.641
It's Jae Seok.

1951
01:19:19.641 --> 01:19:21.743
It's Jae Seok then it can't be Jong Kook.

1952
01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:23.345
I told you it's Jae Seok.

1953
01:19:23.345 --> 01:19:24.746
(Is it really Jae Seok?)

1954
01:19:26.515 --> 01:19:28.717
(He's the new candidate now.)

1955
01:19:29.351 --> 01:19:30.452
This...

1956
01:19:30.452 --> 01:19:32.421
(Is he really...)

1957
01:19:33.655 --> 01:19:38.894
(The hint Jae Seok found said that the assistant is unlucky.)

1958
01:19:39.594 --> 01:19:45.033
(The camera closed up on the watch.)

1959
01:19:46.201 --> 01:19:48.737
It's Kwang Soo. He was wearing the watch.

1960
01:19:49.004 --> 01:19:50.672
There's the watch,

1961
01:19:51.306 --> 01:19:53.041
and I know how Kwang Soo's hand looks like.

1962
01:19:53.275 --> 01:19:54.943
Those are his hands.

1963
01:19:54.943 --> 01:19:57.646
(These hands are Kwang Soo's hands?)

1964
01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.049
Aren't you hungry? Should we order something?

1965
01:20:01.516 --> 01:20:03.518
- Should we have jjajangmyeon? - I like jjajangmyeon too.

1966
01:20:03.819 --> 01:20:06.188
Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon, please.

1967
01:20:07.656 --> 01:20:12.794
(Kwang Soo ordered jjajangmyeon for lunch too.)

1968
01:20:16.431 --> 01:20:18.500
It means this is a fabricated story.

1969
01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:19.601
(He puts the pieces of the puzzle together.)

1970
01:20:21.703 --> 01:20:23.071
This is a fabricated story.

1971
01:20:23.071 --> 01:20:26.942
(The jjajangmyeon and the watch sound like a fabricated story.)

1972
01:20:26.942 --> 01:20:27.943
It's one person.

1973
01:20:28.043 --> 01:20:32.614
(Is Kwang Soo the male assistant?)

1974
01:20:37.586 --> 01:20:39.888
(They come across each other.)

1975
01:20:39.888 --> 01:20:42.891
(Is Kwang Soo the assistant like Jae Seok predicted?)

1976
01:20:43.525 --> 01:20:44.826
Did you find a hint?

1977
01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.294
Yes.

1978
01:20:47.229 --> 01:20:50.265
(You found it.)

1979
01:20:52.267 --> 01:20:55.504
(He checks Kwang Soo's watch.)

1980
01:20:55.704 --> 01:20:56.872
You can't rip mine off.

1981
01:20:56.872 --> 01:20:57.906
(You can only give orders.)

1982
01:20:58.473 --> 01:21:00.575
No, only the assistant can.

1983
01:21:00.575 --> 01:21:01.676
Right.

1984
01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:05.380
(Only the assistant can.)

1985
01:21:06.448 --> 01:21:07.649
That's right.

1986
01:21:08.884 --> 01:21:10.018
Hold on.

1987
01:21:10.018 --> 01:21:11.486
(Let me see your wrist.)

1988
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:13.522
(Goodness)

1989
01:21:13.522 --> 01:21:14.589
What's wrong?

1990
01:21:15.957 --> 01:21:17.092
You are...

1991
01:21:19.694 --> 01:21:22.464
(This watch was...)

1992
01:21:22.464 --> 01:21:26.234
(on the male assistant's wrist.)

1993
01:21:27.769 --> 01:21:32.007
(Does that mean...)

1994
01:21:32.007 --> 01:21:33.208
You are the guy.

1995
01:21:33.708 --> 01:21:34.809
You are the guy.

1996
01:21:34.809 --> 01:21:38.113
(Does that mean Kwang Soo is the male assistant?)

1997
01:21:40.148 --> 01:21:41.349
I think...

1998
01:21:41.349 --> 01:21:43.418
- it's time for you to go. - Where would I go?

1999
01:21:43.418 --> 01:21:45.420
(He's scary.)

2000
01:21:45.654 --> 01:21:46.721
What's wrong with you?

2001
01:21:46.721 --> 01:21:48.723
(Kwang Soo attacks.)

2002
01:21:48.723 --> 01:21:52.093
(He chases Jae Seok while calling somebody.)

2003
01:21:53.295 --> 01:21:55.897
Main building, 2nd floor.

2004
01:21:56.097 --> 01:21:57.432
What is he doing?

2005
01:21:57.999 --> 01:21:59.167
Main building, second floor for Jae Seok.

2006
01:21:59.501 --> 01:22:01.102
(He keeps on telling Jae Seok's location to somebody.)

2007
01:22:01.102 --> 01:22:02.571
It's Jae Seok. He's going back to the first floor.

2008
01:22:03.371 --> 01:22:04.539
He's going back to the first floor.

2009
01:22:04.539 --> 01:22:06.241
Where are you, girl?

2010
01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:09.611
(Is it Ji Hyo?)

2011
01:22:09.611 --> 01:22:12.948
(Is Ji Hyo the female assistant?)

2012
01:22:13.949 --> 01:22:18.954
(But the woman in the hint was unlucky and a coward.)

2013
01:22:18.954 --> 01:22:21.990
(That's totally opposite from Ji Hyo.)

2014
01:22:23.325 --> 01:22:28.930
(Then is Kwang Soo making this up?)

2015
01:22:28.930 --> 01:22:29.998
Hey.

2016
01:22:30.265 --> 01:22:32.434
Come here.

2017
01:22:33.501 --> 01:22:36.371
(Let me see your neck.)

2018
01:22:37.906 --> 01:22:40.775
(Jong Kook is watching another hint video.)

2019
01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:43.345
Hello.

2020
01:22:44.546 --> 01:22:47.249
(Kwang Soo went into the meeting room.)

2021
01:22:47.249 --> 01:22:49.384
(Some time passed and he came out.)

2022
01:22:49.384 --> 01:22:51.019
See you later. Thank you.

2023
01:22:52.387 --> 01:22:54.089
(The chair is empty.)

2024
01:22:54.089 --> 01:22:56.124
Thank you. Please drive safely.

2025
01:22:56.424 --> 01:22:57.525
Thank you.

2026
01:22:57.525 --> 01:22:59.661
(Is he talking to the empty chair?)

2027
01:23:03.932 --> 01:23:05.100
There's nobody.

2028
01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:06.134
(What's this?)

2029
01:23:06.501 --> 01:23:07.636
What's this?

2030
01:23:08.136 --> 01:23:09.170
Let me see.

2031
01:23:09.170 --> 01:23:11.373
(He's still trying to look at Kwang Soo's neck.)

2032
01:23:11.373 --> 01:23:12.574
You have a mole, right?

2033
01:23:13.942 --> 01:23:14.976
You do.

2034
01:23:17.779 --> 01:23:22.684
(Ji Hyo said the female assistant had a neck on her neck.)

2035
01:23:22.684 --> 01:23:24.119
- She has a mole? - Yes.

2036
01:23:28.757 --> 01:23:30.692
He has it.

2037
01:23:33.628 --> 01:23:37.799
(He has a mole in the same position as the female assistant.)

2038
01:23:38.633 --> 01:23:40.568
(Is Kwang Soo also the female assistant?)

2039
01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:45.140
(They're unlucky and cowardly.)

2040
01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.742
(They are so much like Kwang Soo.)

2041
01:23:47.742 --> 01:23:49.678
(The female assistant had a mole,)

2042
01:23:49.678 --> 01:23:52.514
(and the male assistant had a watch.)

2043
01:23:52.514 --> 01:23:56.584
(The watch is on Kwang Soo.)

2044
01:23:56.584 --> 01:24:00.388
(He also has a mole on his neck.)

2045
01:24:00.388 --> 01:24:01.423
(Hold on.)

2046
01:24:01.423 --> 01:24:02.490
Hold on.

2047
01:24:02.490 --> 01:24:04.259
(Does this mean...)

2048
01:24:04.259 --> 01:24:06.561
- Should we get jjajangmyeon? - I like jjajangmyeon.

2049
01:24:07.128 --> 01:24:08.330
I like jjajangmyeon too.

2050
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:11.132
(They all like jjajangmyeon,)

2051
01:24:11.132 --> 01:24:14.969
(and they are all cowards.)

2052
01:24:14.969 --> 01:24:19.808
(They are unlucky as well.)

2053
01:24:23.278 --> 01:24:24.579
Is there no assistant?

2054
01:24:24.579 --> 01:24:26.147
(What's this?)

2055
01:24:26.147 --> 01:24:27.315
Is he by himself?

2056
01:24:27.315 --> 01:24:29.284
(Is Kwang Soo by himself?)

2057
01:24:30.518 --> 01:24:33.621
(The male assistant who wore a watch...)

2058
01:24:33.621 --> 01:24:37.025
(and the female assistant with a mole on her neck...)

2059
01:24:37.025 --> 01:24:40.061
(were all Kwang Soo.)

2060
01:24:40.061 --> 01:24:41.563
Is there no assistant?

2061
01:24:42.831 --> 01:24:43.932
Is he by himself?

2062
01:24:44.499 --> 01:24:45.600
Is Kwang Soo by himself?

2063
01:24:46.201 --> 01:24:48.203
(He's frightened.)

2064
01:24:48.203 --> 01:24:49.304
That's insane.

2065
01:24:50.105 --> 01:24:51.373
I just have to find the walkie-talkie.

2066
01:24:51.373 --> 01:24:53.041
(He knows who the assistant is now.)

2067
01:24:56.745 --> 01:24:58.446
He has the watch hint already?

2068
01:24:58.446 --> 01:24:59.614
(Oh, dear.)

2069
01:25:01.883 --> 01:25:08.256
(You can eliminate the assistant by speaking into the walkie-talkie.)

2070
01:25:11.092 --> 01:25:12.193
This is the end.

2071
01:25:13.128 --> 01:25:14.129
This is the end.

2072
01:25:15.196 --> 01:25:16.197
The assistant is...

2073
01:25:17.732 --> 01:25:18.767
Lee Kwang Soo.

2074
01:25:19.267 --> 01:25:20.735
He is faking it.

2075
01:25:24.072 --> 01:25:26.408
Eliminate Kwang Soo's name tag.

2076
01:25:26.408 --> 01:25:29.911
(Rip off Kwang Soo's name tag.)

2077
01:25:31.212 --> 01:25:33.415
You have to rip off Kwang Soo's name tag.

2078
01:25:33.415 --> 01:25:35.617
Gosh. This is unbelievable.

2079
01:25:37.452 --> 01:25:44.559
(Jae Seok has to rip Kwang Soo's name tag off.)

2080
01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.828
Where is he?

2081
01:25:46.828 --> 01:25:48.663
(Where are you, Kwang Soo?)

2082
01:25:51.733 --> 01:25:54.469
(He spots Kwang Soo.)

2083
01:25:57.705 --> 01:25:58.740
You are alone.

2084
01:25:59.541 --> 01:26:01.709
(Is he calling someone again?)

2085
01:26:02.911 --> 01:26:04.446
Who are you calling?

2086
01:26:06.915 --> 01:26:10.418
(Give me your name tag.)

2087
01:26:12.654 --> 01:26:17.392
(Kwang Soo did not expect Jae Seok's attack.)

2088
01:26:18.893 --> 01:26:21.629
(This will end now.)

2089
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:25.733
(The situation reached its breaking point.)

2090
01:26:28.937 --> 01:26:33.441
(A phone starts to ring as Kwang Soo makes the call.)

2091
01:26:34.943 --> 01:26:36.644
(He stops.)

2092
01:26:44.819 --> 01:26:45.820
What's going on?

2093
01:26:46.721 --> 01:26:51.526
(Is there another assistant other than Kwang Soo?)

2094
01:26:53.761 --> 01:26:58.066
(Whose phone is ringing?)

2095
01:27:01.369 --> 01:27:05.139
(Hold on. He is...)

2096
01:27:05.139 --> 01:27:07.542
(Shin Sung Rok)

2097
01:27:07.876 --> 01:27:09.310
He is not alone.

2098
01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:13.781
(Hi, Jae Seok.)

2099
01:27:15.283 --> 01:27:18.553
(He starts running after Jae Seok without any hesitation.)

2100
01:27:18.553 --> 01:27:19.587
Sung Rok.

2101
01:27:21.756 --> 01:27:22.757
Grab him.

2102
01:27:22.757 --> 01:27:23.758
(He ran fast...)

2103
01:27:23.758 --> 01:27:25.360
(and ripped off Jae Seok's name tag.)

2104
01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.995
(He helps Kwang Soo to rip name tags off.)

2105
01:27:26.995 --> 01:27:28.997
(What's his identity?)

2106
01:27:30.098 --> 01:27:31.099
Is he alone?

2107
01:27:31.099 --> 01:27:32.500
(10 minutes earlier, after Jong Koon saw the hint.)

2108
01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:33.501
This is crazy.

2109
01:27:34.435 --> 01:27:37.472
(The hint was not over.)

2110
01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.610
(After Kwang Soo left,)

2111
01:27:42.610 --> 01:27:47.582
(Sung Rok came out quietly.)

2112
01:27:49.784 --> 01:27:52.053
We should decide...

2113
01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:55.523
who will get penalized this week.

2114
01:27:55.523 --> 01:27:56.524
(However)

2115
01:27:57.191 --> 01:27:59.527
Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon, please.

2116
01:27:59.527 --> 01:28:00.828
(Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon, please.)

2117
01:28:01.095 --> 01:28:03.097
(Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon?)

2118
01:28:04.332 --> 01:28:06.267
(Jjajangmyeon is for Kwang Soo.)

2119
01:28:06.267 --> 01:28:09.837
(Jaengban jjajangmyeon is for Sung Rok.)

2120
01:28:10.572 --> 01:28:14.309
Why do we have to go inside of Cage of Death?

2121
01:28:14.676 --> 01:28:15.710
Please help me.

2122
01:28:16.077 --> 01:28:17.445
(When he reached his arm to handshake,)

2123
01:28:17.445 --> 01:28:21.015
(someone else grabbed his hand from another angle.)

2124
01:28:23.885 --> 01:28:26.487
(It was Sung Rok.)

2125
01:28:26.487 --> 01:28:29.257
(The hidden assistant was Sung Rok.)

2126
01:28:30.725 --> 01:28:31.759
Let's end this now.

2127
01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.529
(No one expected...)

2128
01:28:34.529 --> 01:28:38.166
(Sung Rok's name tag hunting.)

2129
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:45.640
(Ji Hyo was eliminated by his quick and surprise attack.)

2130
01:28:48.710 --> 01:28:51.112
(To complete his mission,)

2131
01:28:51.112 --> 01:28:55.249
(he has to rip off Jong Kook's name tag.)

2132
01:28:56.084 --> 01:28:57.485
What's going on?

2133
01:28:57.518 --> 01:28:59.187
What's going on? Wasn't it you?

2134
01:28:59.187 --> 01:29:00.188
Wasn't it you?

2135
01:29:00.221 --> 01:29:01.289
I wasn't the assistant.

2136
01:29:01.289 --> 01:29:02.323
You were not the assistant?

2137
01:29:02.457 --> 01:29:03.491
It was his self-fabricated scenario.

2138
01:29:03.925 --> 01:29:06.127
Everyone in the video was Kwang Soo.

2139
01:29:06.127 --> 01:29:08.529
Was it computer graphic then?

2140
01:29:09.097 --> 01:29:10.531
- I don't get it. - What's going on?

2141
01:29:10.531 --> 01:29:12.133
- They were both Kwang Soo. - Were they?

2142
01:29:12.133 --> 01:29:13.334
Yes. It was Kwang Soo.

2143
01:29:13.334 --> 01:29:14.469
- And... - Then what about...

2144
01:29:14.469 --> 01:29:16.838
real assistants were not them.

2145
01:29:17.038 --> 01:29:19.540
It was Sung Rok who stayed separately.

2146
01:29:19.574 --> 01:29:21.109
Sung Rok is the assistant.

2147
01:29:21.609 --> 01:29:24.278
- We know that already. - We were eliminated by him.

2148
01:29:24.512 --> 01:29:25.947
- Oh, really? - Gosh.

2149
01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.915
(He's embarrassed.)

2150
01:29:27.915 --> 01:29:29.784
- He didn't know anything. - Why didn't you know that?

2151
01:29:31.386 --> 01:29:33.755
The assistant is Kwang Soo.

2152
01:29:34.022 --> 01:29:38.893
Rip off Kwang Soo's name tag.

2153
01:29:38.893 --> 01:29:41.462
(He gets happy as he thinks he found the assistant.)

2154
01:29:43.131 --> 01:29:46.034
There is only Jong Kook's name tag left.

2155
01:29:46.034 --> 01:29:47.335
That's why we've to look for him.

2156
01:29:48.903 --> 01:29:51.439
(Aren't I clever?)

2157
01:29:54.042 --> 01:29:55.043
Gosh.

2158
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:57.311
Kwang Soo.

2159
01:29:57.311 --> 01:29:58.312
(It's good to see you.)

2160
01:29:58.312 --> 01:30:00.448
You found the hint.

2161
01:30:00.448 --> 01:30:02.750
- Yes. - You found the hint.

2162
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:05.186
- Okay. Let go of my arm first. - Hey you.

2163
01:30:05.186 --> 01:30:08.122
- You little... - Stop.

2164
01:30:08.122 --> 01:30:10.291
- Jong Kook. - What's going on?

2165
01:30:10.324 --> 01:30:11.325
Hey. What is this?

2166
01:30:11.459 --> 01:30:14.362
(What is going on?)

2167
01:30:14.362 --> 01:30:15.630
"I'm not the assistant."

2168
01:30:15.730 --> 01:30:17.899
(I'm not the assistant.)

2169
01:30:18.933 --> 01:30:20.535
(Oh, it's Sung Rok.)

2170
01:30:21.335 --> 01:30:22.470
Did he rip Kwang Soo's name tag off?

2171
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:23.471
(Gosh)

2172
01:30:23.738 --> 01:30:26.340
I should go and protect the walkie-talkie.

2173
01:30:26.541 --> 01:30:27.542
I should go now.

2174
01:30:27.542 --> 01:30:28.543
(He wants to block Jong Kook from reporting.)

2175
01:30:30.511 --> 01:30:32.213
Let's run. We have to run now.

2176
01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:34.515
(If Sung Rok eliminates Jong Kook,)

2177
01:30:34.515 --> 01:30:38.319
(Kwang Soo can choose 2 people for the penalty.)

2178
01:30:39.387 --> 01:30:40.922
(This is the end.)

2179
01:30:40.922 --> 01:30:43.257
(Who will get to the walkie-talkie first?)

2180
01:30:45.259 --> 01:30:49.030
(Sung Rok arrives at the place after running with his everything.)

2181
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:50.098
The assistant is...

2182
01:30:52.767 --> 01:30:55.503
(Jong Kook got here faster than Sung Rok.)

2183
01:30:57.371 --> 01:30:59.907
The assistant is Sung Rok.

2184
01:30:59.907 --> 01:31:02.610
(The assistant is Sung Rok.)

2185
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:04.612
(The assistant Sung Rok is eliminated.)

2186
01:31:05.179 --> 01:31:08.883
I was lucky to spot Kwang Soo first.

2187
01:31:09.283 --> 01:31:11.085
I was so surprised.

2188
01:31:11.085 --> 01:31:12.320
(The race ends. Jong Kook receives the exemption pass.)

2189
01:31:14.122 --> 01:31:16.891
For the last Death Signal,

2190
01:31:17.191 --> 01:31:20.161
only Jong Kook received the exemption pass.

2191
01:31:20.728 --> 01:31:23.631
For the final decision,

2192
01:31:23.631 --> 01:31:27.468
Kwang Soo can rip the member's name tag off that he wants to take with.

2193
01:31:28.469 --> 01:31:30.304
(1 person will experience...)

2194
01:31:30.304 --> 01:31:32.940
(Cage of Death with Kwang Soo in Australia.)

2195
01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:37.145
(Who will experience this horrifying crocodile with Kwang Soo?)

2196
01:31:38.613 --> 01:31:40.314
Everyone, make a short speech.

2197
01:31:41.349 --> 01:31:42.984
Just choose one.

2198
01:31:42.984 --> 01:31:45.820
(He is so sick of it.)

2199
01:31:46.754 --> 01:31:49.290
- Yes. - Those two can go to Australia...

2200
01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:50.892
- on their way to New Zealand. - It's a good idea.

2201
01:31:50.892 --> 01:31:52.126
- It's okay. - Is it?

2202
01:31:52.126 --> 01:31:54.095
- It costs us even less that way. - Can we do that?

2203
01:31:55.029 --> 01:31:56.030
Kwang Soo.

2204
01:31:56.631 --> 01:31:58.332
- Nevis Swing is... - I think...

2205
01:31:58.332 --> 01:31:59.500
on the way to Australia and New Zealand,.

2206
01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:03.237
Why do you care so much?

2207
01:32:03.671 --> 01:32:05.039
I'll listen to him first.

2208
01:32:05.039 --> 01:32:10.444
There are also some members who didn't get any penalties.

2209
01:32:10.645 --> 01:32:14.282
I think we should balance it out a bit.

2210
01:32:14.282 --> 01:32:16.117
- I agree. - I think so too.

2211
01:32:16.117 --> 01:32:18.019
I will just say one thing.

2212
01:32:18.019 --> 01:32:20.922
I and Haha have to go and experience Nevis Swing.

2213
01:32:20.922 --> 01:32:22.623
- Okay. You don't need to go. - I've done everything.

2214
01:32:22.623 --> 01:32:23.925
(Okay. I won't choose Se Chan.)

2215
01:32:24.358 --> 01:32:26.394
- Why? - Gosh. Thank you so much.

2216
01:32:26.394 --> 01:32:28.396
Why? Why are you not choosing him?

2217
01:32:28.396 --> 01:32:29.430
(Why did he choose Se Chan over me?)

2218
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:30.598
- I even went to Indonesia. - Good.

2219
01:32:30.598 --> 01:32:32.466
- Thank you. - You had a hard time.

2220
01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.935
Thank you. Let's go!

2221
01:32:33.935 --> 01:32:35.536
(Did you forget?)

2222
01:32:36.804 --> 01:32:38.206
Gosh. So Min also...

2223
01:32:38.506 --> 01:32:40.842
True. So Min also went there.

2224
01:32:40.842 --> 01:32:44.145
I even went to Indonesia.

2225
01:32:45.313 --> 01:32:47.014
- Why are you doing this? - Why are you kneeling?

2226
01:32:47.014 --> 01:32:48.182
Why are you kneeling?

2227
01:32:48.182 --> 01:32:50.218
Her knees are lighter than the feathers.

2228
01:32:50.218 --> 01:32:51.252
She kneels all the time.

2229
01:32:51.252 --> 01:32:52.553
We went to Indonesia together.

2230
01:32:52.553 --> 01:32:53.621
(Do you remember that?)

2231
01:32:54.755 --> 01:32:57.024
- Okay. Let's not choose So Min. - I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

2232
01:32:58.492 --> 01:33:00.428
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.)

2233
01:33:00.428 --> 01:33:02.530
(I'm scared of crocodiles.)

2234
01:33:03.397 --> 01:33:05.299
- I'm sorry too. - I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

2235
01:33:05.299 --> 01:33:07.401
Jae Seok and Seok Jin are just standing still.

2236
01:33:07.435 --> 01:33:08.769
Why do we have to lie down on the floor?

2237
01:33:08.769 --> 01:33:11.305
- I'm even old. - Haha is just standing still.

2238
01:33:11.305 --> 01:33:12.740
- Kwang Soo, I'm sorry. - Kwang Soo.

2239
01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:15.276
- Kwang Soo. - He isn't lying down properly.

2240
01:33:15.276 --> 01:33:17.912
(He wanted to keep his dignity.)

2241
01:33:17.912 --> 01:33:19.447
Okay. Get up, Seok Jin.

2242
01:33:19.814 --> 01:33:21.315
- Kwang Soo. - First of all,

2243
01:33:21.315 --> 01:33:23.951
So Min went to Indonesia a while ago.

2244
01:33:24.619 --> 01:33:25.753
She's not going then.

2245
01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.922
You survived.

2246
01:33:28.890 --> 01:33:33.527
Anyway, Kwang Soo still needs to decide...

2247
01:33:33.527 --> 01:33:36.030
the person he wants to take from the rest.

2248
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:38.099
Everyone is a coward except Ji Hyo.

2249
01:33:38.099 --> 01:33:39.133
That's right.

2250
01:33:39.133 --> 01:33:41.002
I can see that only cowards are left.

2251
01:33:41.002 --> 01:33:43.437
- We are cowards except Ji Hyo. - That's right.

2252
01:33:44.939 --> 01:33:45.973
On Chuseok...

2253
01:33:46.407 --> 01:33:49.243
I had to do my penalty mission on Chuseok.

2254
01:33:49.243 --> 01:33:51.112
You already had a penalty last week.

2255
01:33:51.112 --> 01:33:52.813
Jae Seok, you can come this side.

2256
01:33:53.114 --> 01:33:55.483
- Oh really? - You can come this side.

2257
01:33:55.483 --> 01:33:58.219
(Jae Seok survived.)

2258
01:33:58.986 --> 01:34:00.554
Why?

2259
01:34:00.554 --> 01:34:02.757
(I hate him.)

2260
01:34:03.024 --> 01:34:04.025
Why?

2261
01:34:04.025 --> 01:34:05.026
(Have a safe trip to Australia.)

2262
01:34:05.026 --> 01:34:07.662
(Ripping off)

2263
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:11.032
(Ripping off)

2264
01:34:11.032 --> 01:34:14.468
(He just ripped off Jae Seok's name tag. What's going on?)

2265
01:34:14.468 --> 01:34:15.469
Gosh.

2266
01:34:15.469 --> 01:34:17.638
(What are you doing?)

2267
01:34:18.139 --> 01:34:20.341
(What's going on?)

2268
01:34:20.841 --> 01:34:23.077
(Kwang Soo chooses Jae Seok as his partner to Australia.)

2269
01:34:23.311 --> 01:34:25.246
I thought he was going to take my name tag.

2270
01:34:25.246 --> 01:34:26.714
(Everyone is confused.)

2271
01:34:27.114 --> 01:34:28.282
I thought so too.

2272
01:34:28.282 --> 01:34:30.284
Didn't you tell me to stand this side?

2273
01:34:30.284 --> 01:34:31.852
Yes, to rip off your name tag.

2274
01:34:32.653 --> 01:34:36.557
All right. Kwang Soo's partner to Australia is...

2275
01:34:37.491 --> 01:34:38.960
Jae Seok.

2276
01:34:39.126 --> 01:34:41.128
- You did a great job. - Great.

2277
01:34:41.128 --> 01:34:43.397
There are so many twists.

2278
01:34:43.397 --> 01:34:44.565
You are awesome.

2279
01:34:44.565 --> 01:34:45.599
It's awesome.

2280
01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.135
Am I really going then?

2281
01:34:48.135 --> 01:34:49.270
Cage of Death.

2282
01:34:50.638 --> 01:34:53.841
(You...)

2283
01:34:53.841 --> 01:34:56.877
(worked...)

2284
01:34:56.877 --> 01:34:59.914
(so hard.)

2285
01:34:59.914 --> 01:35:03.117
(You can do whatever you want.)

2286
01:35:03.751 --> 01:35:07.388
(There will be no penalty. It's time to have fun.)

2287
01:35:07.388 --> 01:35:10.491
(Let's do anything we want.)

2288
01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:14.862
(This is not how I imagined.)

2289
01:35:14.962 --> 01:35:18.165
(This is not a penalty, right?)

2290
01:35:18.366 --> 01:35:21.202
(I did everything I wanted.)

2291
01:35:21.202 --> 01:35:23.471
(I want it to end.)

2292
01:35:25.606 --> 01:35:27.508
(Let's stop. My underwear is wet.)

2293
01:35:27.775 --> 01:35:30.578
(Autumn Vacation Race)

2294
01:35:31.345 --> 01:35:35.349
(Running Man)
