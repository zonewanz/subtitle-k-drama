1
00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:20.154
The victims were all charged with a serious murder,

2
00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:21.814
but they were found innocent.

3
00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.454
The police can't establish justice in the society,

4
00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:26.123
which is why the culprit is doing it himself.

5
00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:27.623
Stenographer?

6
00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:28.893
It's someone who's in the court...

7
00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:31.123
and knows every specific detail about the case.

8
00:00:32.994 --> 00:00:35.734
But it's not up to us to kill him or let him live.

9
00:00:35.863 --> 00:00:38.134
It's up to me to punish guys like this.

10
00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:44.874
The law can't do its job, so the world is going insane.

11
00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:49.944
My head really hurts.

12
00:00:49.944 --> 00:00:52.113
You'll feel happy.

13
00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:56.984
Take your time, and look around.

14
00:00:59.323 --> 00:01:01.994
A woman was found murdered at a show house.

15
00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:04.863
The killer lured them there.

16
00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.693
The killer used the utensils in the kitchen to cook and drink.

17
00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:08.934
He even put in bath bombs to take a bath...

18
00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.434
as if that was his home.

19
00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:13.773
The killer may obsess over such fantasies and ideals.

20
00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:17.044
Look into whether there were any similar cases in the past.

21
00:01:21.943 --> 00:01:24.814
(Episode 17)

22
00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:34.493
Hurry up. Why are you still there?

23
00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.454
Why did the culprit choose a show house?

24
00:01:36.624 --> 00:01:40.294
It could be because it's easy to commit a crime here.

25
00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:45.133
Show houses are not guarded as well as we think they are.

26
00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:46.533
They are mostly temporary buildings,

27
00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:51.104
and not many of them have permits to use surveillance cameras.

28
00:01:52.143 --> 00:01:53.844
They are owned by the construction company,

29
00:01:53.844 --> 00:01:55.973
but in fact, they are open to the public.

30
00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:02.484
It's possible that the culprit works for the construction company.

31
00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:04.924
He could be a worker at the show house.

32
00:02:05.053 --> 00:02:08.593
There'd be a lot of people who have access to the show house.

33
00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:11.023
There are real estate agents, workers of the construction company,

34
00:02:11.023 --> 00:02:13.963
people who come to visit, and the people who promote.

35
00:02:14.393 --> 00:02:17.734
The password is probably "0000" or "1234".

36
00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:21.204
That means we have a wide range of suspects.

37
00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:43.463
Undigested food was found from the victim's stomach.

38
00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:47.264
It means the victim had a meal with the culprit here.

39
00:03:06.343 --> 00:03:09.454
The victim would have been attacked here suddenly.

40
00:03:20.463 --> 00:03:21.933
Yes, that's true.

41
00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:25.204
There was evidence of that right here.

42
00:03:27.704 --> 00:03:30.143
There should have been bloodstains all over the place.

43
00:03:31.174 --> 00:03:33.143
But the floor is clean without any traces.

44
00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.083
Team Manager Kang,

45
00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:40.713
In the similar incident that happened two months ago,

46
00:03:40.713 --> 00:03:42.754
the culprit left the victim...

47
00:03:42.754 --> 00:03:44.254
and left the scene.

48
00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:46.123
The culprit also left bloodstains behind.

49
00:03:46.523 --> 00:03:49.724
It's highly likely that the murder was impulsive, not planned.

50
00:03:50.393 --> 00:03:53.734
The victim's belongings and bag have been ransacked.

51
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.534
But it's also possible that it was done on purpose...

52
00:03:56.534 --> 00:03:58.433
to make it look like robbery.

53
00:03:59.563 --> 00:04:01.734
On the other hand, the crime scene of the second murder...

54
00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:04.743
shows no sign of murder and was left clean.

55
00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.414
Do you really think that these were committed by the same culprit?

56
00:04:08.574 --> 00:04:12.044
The type of victims, the way he kills these victims,

57
00:04:12.643 --> 00:04:14.583
and the fact that he kills in show houses...

58
00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:16.584
can be his signatures.

59
00:04:17.484 --> 00:04:19.623
We should think of them as murders committed by the same culprit.

60
00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:20.993
Yes.

61
00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.763
There are a lot of cases in which, after an impulsive...

62
00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.894
and accidental murder, the culprit could not forget...

63
00:04:26.263 --> 00:04:30.003
what it felt to kill someone and committed murder again.

64
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.863
That's what happened in Jang Gi Tae's shooting incident.

65
00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:35.604
Hey, are you crazy?

66
00:04:41.974 --> 00:04:45.613
Team Manager Kang, I've been searching for similar cases.

67
00:04:46.544 --> 00:04:48.953
A week before the first incident,

68
00:04:49.183 --> 00:04:51.883
there was a similar assault incident.

69
00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:54.094
The victims was Park Ji Sun, 28 years old.

70
00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:57.323
She was working at an on-site massage center at that time.

71
00:04:57.594 --> 00:05:00.993
After she refused a man who tried to drag her into a show house,

72
00:05:00.993 --> 00:05:04.234
she was beaten up severely before she managed to run away.

73
00:05:04.234 --> 00:05:05.404
Who were the suspects?

74
00:05:05.933 --> 00:05:07.734
Based on the victim's testimonies,

75
00:05:07.734 --> 00:05:12.203
they looked into laborers or workers near the show house,

76
00:05:12.203 --> 00:05:14.914
but they didn't find anyone suspicious.

77
00:05:15.743 --> 00:05:19.044
One week later, the culprit committed murder,

78
00:05:19.313 --> 00:05:22.154
and then he started killing again two months later.

79
00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:24.724
After an impulsive murder,

80
00:05:25.154 --> 00:05:26.854
the culprit would have gotten scared.

81
00:05:27.024 --> 00:05:28.993
But after seeing that the police could not find him,

82
00:05:29.053 --> 00:05:30.823
he would have regained his confidence.

83
00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:34.334
That means it's possible that his pattern could speed up.

84
00:05:34.664 --> 00:05:37.063
I need to meet the victim. Call her.

85
00:05:37.063 --> 00:05:38.164
Yes, sir.

86
00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:42.904
When the forensics arrived,

87
00:05:42.904 --> 00:05:45.274
the water in the bathtub was still warm.

88
00:05:45.904 --> 00:05:49.943
That means the culprit stayed here until early in the morning.

89
00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:01.354
It was estimated that the victim was murdered between 12am and 1am.

90
00:06:01.553 --> 00:06:04.493
That means the culprit killed the woman, tidied up the mess,

91
00:06:04.493 --> 00:06:06.363
and enjoyed his bath during that time.

92
00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:08.993
Something does not add up.

93
00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:11.964
He left the body in the sink...

94
00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:14.534
and enjoyed his bath.

95
00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:18.073
That means he wasn't afraid to leave traces behind.

96
00:06:19.203 --> 00:06:21.313
But he cleaned up the bloodstains.

97
00:06:22.873 --> 00:06:24.784
A show house...

98
00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:26.883
is the manifestation of the perfect home.

99
00:06:26.883 --> 00:06:30.084
The killer may obsess over such fantasies and ideals.

100
00:06:31.284 --> 00:06:33.553
What if it wasn't the bloodstain that the culprit had cleaned up?

101
00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:36.763
The culprit could have cleaned up because the house had gotten dirty.

102
00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.594
He wouldn't have wanted...

103
00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:44.164
his perfect space to be left dirty.

104
00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:01.354
After the incident, Park Ji Sun hasn't been out a lot.

105
00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.823
She has been diagnosed with PTSD,

106
00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.854
and she is still receiving psychotherapy.

107
00:07:05.854 --> 00:07:07.623
She only agreed to meet us...

108
00:07:07.623 --> 00:07:09.524
after she heard there had been more victims.

109
00:07:09.823 --> 00:07:11.164
But I don't know if this could work.

110
00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:12.464
Let's go.

111
00:07:15.094 --> 00:07:18.063
Thank you for agreeing to meet with us.

112
00:07:20.104 --> 00:07:21.604
I know it's hard,

113
00:07:22.003 --> 00:07:24.703
but can you tell us about what happened?

114
00:07:31.613 --> 00:07:35.613
Hoon, do you want to buy some snacks from the store?

115
00:07:35.683 --> 00:07:36.883
Yes, Mom.

116
00:07:36.883 --> 00:07:39.383
I'll buy the candy that you like too.

117
00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:47.534
That day,

118
00:07:48.794 --> 00:07:50.834
I received a call for the first time in a while.

119
00:07:52.203 --> 00:07:54.433
I had been sick because of cold,

120
00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:57.974
but I went anyway.

121
00:08:11.584 --> 00:08:13.024
(Seoul, Dalnam-gu, Dae 3-dong, 83-3)

122
00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:18.823
I hesitated.

123
00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:21.294
That wasn't...

124
00:08:22.863 --> 00:08:25.303
a normal place to be.

125
00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:30.344
While I was standing there,

126
00:08:31.243 --> 00:08:34.473
a man wearing a cap came out.

127
00:08:35.343 --> 00:08:36.914
He told me to follow him.

128
00:08:38.683 --> 00:08:39.843
He said this was the place.

129
00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.063
Wait, this is not your house.

130
00:08:54.563 --> 00:08:55.664
Wait.

131
00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:20.453
How did you get out of the show house?

132
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.323
I don't know.

133
00:09:22.593 --> 00:09:24.193
I wasn't thinking straight.

134
00:09:25.624 --> 00:09:27.764
I just wanted to live.

135
00:09:29.563 --> 00:09:31.004
I begged him not to kill me.

136
00:09:37.943 --> 00:09:39.644
If I think about it now,

137
00:09:40.674 --> 00:09:43.784
I think he might have just let me go.

138
00:09:45.244 --> 00:09:46.813
I don't know.

139
00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:50.154
Is there a special reason why you think so?

140
00:09:50.453 --> 00:09:52.183
I'm not sure, but...

141
00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:56.664
This is just my guess,

142
00:09:58.323 --> 00:10:00.394
but I think it was because of my son.

143
00:10:00.994 --> 00:10:02.333
Your son?

144
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.904
Please don't kill me. I have a son.

145
00:10:05.904 --> 00:10:09.333
I'm the only one he has. He will starve to death without me.

146
00:10:09.404 --> 00:10:12.973
Please don't kill me. Please. Please!

147
00:10:12.973 --> 00:10:13.973
Please!

148
00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:15.573
(My angel, Hoon)

149
00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:31.364
Please help me! Please.

150
00:10:31.463 --> 00:10:32.794
Help me.

151
00:10:32.794 --> 00:10:34.364
Please help me!

152
00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:38.034
Please help me! Help me!

153
00:10:38.664 --> 00:10:41.534
Help me.

154
00:10:51.244 --> 00:10:52.443
Do you...

155
00:10:52.744 --> 00:10:55.114
remember anything about the culprit?

156
00:10:56.654 --> 00:10:58.424
There was nothing special.

157
00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:02.624
I already told the police about this.

158
00:11:02.894 --> 00:11:04.124
It's all right.

159
00:11:04.524 --> 00:11:07.433
You can tell us anything you remember.

160
00:11:08.864 --> 00:11:13.004
He wasn't dressed up nicely.

161
00:11:13.374 --> 00:11:17.303
He was wearing an old jacket.

162
00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:23.313
I noticed a lot of dirt on his sneakers.

163
00:11:29.183 --> 00:11:32.323
I think he had a stutter as well.

164
00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:34.424
I could smell alcohol too.

165
00:11:35.853 --> 00:11:38.164
He had something in his hand,

166
00:11:39.124 --> 00:11:40.994
and he kept on fiddling with it.

167
00:11:43.634 --> 00:11:46.233
Do you remember what it was?

168
00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:49.073
It was something I've never seen before.

169
00:11:51.973 --> 00:11:53.473
It looked like a weight.

170
00:11:53.943 --> 00:11:58.544
It was pointy. It kind of resembled a bullet.

171
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.614
I'm not entirely sure,

172
00:12:02.754 --> 00:12:03.924
but I think...

173
00:12:05.053 --> 00:12:07.953
there was a hook of some kind.

174
00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:09.593
A weight with a hook?

175
00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:13.894
Yes. It was made out of metal.

176
00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:15.233
Hold on.

177
00:12:22.473 --> 00:12:23.573
Does it look like this?

178
00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:25.473
I think that's it.

179
00:12:26.144 --> 00:12:27.244
It's a plumb.

180
00:12:27.473 --> 00:12:30.014
It's used to level structures.

181
00:12:30.144 --> 00:12:31.683
It's often used on construction sites.

182
00:12:36.624 --> 00:12:37.784
Yes, I understand.

183
00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:43.794
Sir, the result is out from the NFS.

184
00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:46.794
On both the culprit's wine glass and the victim's hair,

185
00:12:46.963 --> 00:12:49.634
they found a designer drug of the amphetamine family.

186
00:12:49.764 --> 00:12:50.764
Let's see.

187
00:12:54.303 --> 00:12:56.573
This is the newest popular drug, flakka.

188
00:12:56.874 --> 00:12:59.544
It causes extreme delirium and induces violent behavior.

189
00:12:59.544 --> 00:13:01.343
It's also called the "zombie drug".

190
00:13:01.443 --> 00:13:03.943
It's expensive compared to other drugs,

191
00:13:03.943 --> 00:13:06.313
so most of the deals are made online.

192
00:13:09.083 --> 00:13:11.083
(National Criminal Investigation)

193
00:13:11.983 --> 00:13:14.754
I looked into the lives of victims Yoo Ah Young and Lee Jin Hee.

194
00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:17.093
I think I know how they were related to the suspect.

195
00:13:17.323 --> 00:13:20.864
They were big spenders compared to their earnings.

196
00:13:21.164 --> 00:13:24.664
They were working part-time as dating partners.

197
00:13:25.303 --> 00:13:28.174
They usually met through a website called Date Mate.

198
00:13:28.803 --> 00:13:30.244
They call it a date mate,

199
00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:32.644
but it's obvious prostitution is involved.

200
00:13:32.803 --> 00:13:35.443
Are there overlapping customers between the two victims?

201
00:13:35.644 --> 00:13:37.343
I looked into that already.

202
00:13:37.614 --> 00:13:40.713
There were no overlapping numbers or online accounts.

203
00:13:41.114 --> 00:13:42.953
They likely used a fake number...

204
00:13:42.953 --> 00:13:45.483
or they could have signed in with a hidden IP address.

205
00:13:46.453 --> 00:13:49.624
The culprit chose female targets through the profiles online,

206
00:13:49.894 --> 00:13:51.463
then he lured them in.

207
00:14:00.134 --> 00:14:02.374
Let's go through all the cases up to now.

208
00:14:03.174 --> 00:14:05.843
To the culprit, the show house...

209
00:14:05.943 --> 00:14:08.144
must have been a place where he could fill with fantasies.

210
00:14:08.644 --> 00:14:10.713
In the perfect space,

211
00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.914
he would spend time with a woman of his type.

212
00:14:14.183 --> 00:14:17.483
But once that fantasy broke, he would kill the woman.

213
00:14:18.083 --> 00:14:20.124
The type of victims he chose...

214
00:14:20.124 --> 00:14:23.924
will likely be related to the type of woman that cause him trauma.

215
00:14:24.424 --> 00:14:27.134
It could be his mother, wife, or a girlfriend.

216
00:14:28.364 --> 00:14:30.963
He would fall into a fantasy there,

217
00:14:30.963 --> 00:14:32.833
thinking that he could create the perfect family.

218
00:14:34.103 --> 00:14:38.103
Just for that night, he'll think of the place as his sweet home.

219
00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:39.203
The show house.

220
00:14:39.404 --> 00:14:40.414
Hye Bin.

221
00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:08.333
According to Park Ji Sun's testimony and the crime pattern,

222
00:15:08.534 --> 00:15:11.774
I think it's likely that the suspect works in construction.

223
00:15:12.803 --> 00:15:15.644
He could be one of the workers that assisted...

224
00:15:15.644 --> 00:15:16.943
with making the show house.

225
00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:20.754
He's looking for his own method through the murders.

226
00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:23.524
The first murder was impulsive,

227
00:15:23.524 --> 00:15:27.953
while you can see aspects that were planned for the second.

228
00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:29.894
There's another thing to note.

229
00:15:30.294 --> 00:15:32.723
During the second murder, he took drugs.

230
00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:35.294
He committed murder under the influence.

231
00:15:35.364 --> 00:15:38.164
However, we didn't find traces of drugs in the first case.

232
00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:41.803
Park Ji Sun told us that she could smell alcohol.

233
00:15:41.803 --> 00:15:44.573
He was probably drunk at that time as well.

234
00:15:45.174 --> 00:15:48.813
He must have searched for something stronger.

235
00:15:49.213 --> 00:15:51.614
If he's becoming addicted to drugs,

236
00:15:52.083 --> 00:15:54.983
then his urge to kill will go beyond our control.

237
00:15:56.053 --> 00:15:59.453
Which means he'll commit another murder soon.

238
00:15:59.624 --> 00:16:03.563
However, it won't be easy for him to murder in the same way.

239
00:16:03.593 --> 00:16:06.063
If he doesn't give up his fantasies,

240
00:16:06.294 --> 00:16:09.833
then he won't give up the space which makes up the hallucinations.

241
00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:12.303
It might not be a show house,

242
00:16:12.303 --> 00:16:15.374
but he'll commit murder in a similar environment.

243
00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:18.473
You're right. He might change his pattern,

244
00:16:18.473 --> 00:16:20.244
but he won't give up on his fantasies.

Where?

254
00:18:05.243 --> 00:18:06.243
My house.

255
00:18:08.453 --> 00:18:11.253
This place...

256
00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:13.953
seems a little strange.

257
00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:20.033
If it's okay with you, can we go to a hotel?

258
00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:22.693
Why bother when I have an apartment?

259
00:18:23.033 --> 00:18:26.003
I'll pay you extra instead of the hotel. Let's go.

260
00:18:27.604 --> 00:18:28.604
Okay.

261
00:18:32.574 --> 00:18:33.644
Are you coming?

262
00:18:33.644 --> 00:18:35.814
Yes, I'm coming.

263
00:19:17.624 --> 00:19:19.253
Do you live here?

264
00:19:21.854 --> 00:19:23.624
There's nothing in here.

265

266
00:19:32.664 --> 00:19:33.674
What?

267
00:19:37.243 --> 00:19:38.943
- Sit here for a minute. - Pardon?

268
00:19:39.104 --> 00:19:41.243
Okay. By the way...

269
00:20:04.933 --> 00:20:06.033
Excuse me.

270

Where did you go?

272
00:20:26.023 --> 00:20:28.654
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

273
00:20:28.793 --> 00:20:30.324
Pardon? No...

274

275
00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:38.904
we can go out to date?

276
00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:45.943
I need to go to the convenience store.

277
00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:50.884
I have a bad headache.

278
00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:53.654
I'll be quick.

279
00:20:58.253 --> 00:20:59.324
Hold on.

280
00:21:01.753 --> 00:21:03.193
Do you not like it here?

281
00:21:07.793 --> 00:21:08.864
Yes, sir.

Building 104 is almost finished.

283

No, of course not.

284
00:21:16.773 --> 00:21:19.973
I put it on the sink so that they can't take it off.

285

Please don't kill me.

Please let me live.

Please don't kill me.

Please don't kill me. Please.

289
00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:45.703
Of course.

290
00:21:46.364 --> 00:21:47.933
I haven't even started.

291
00:21:48.233 --> 00:21:49.733
You can't die just yet.

292
00:21:57.713 --> 00:21:59.953
I'll kill you if you make any sound.

293
00:22:07.023 --> 00:22:08.394
You scared me.

294
00:22:10.023 --> 00:22:11.723
- Who are you? - I'm...

295
00:22:12.763 --> 00:22:14.493
I'm from the real estate nearby.

296
00:22:14.493 --> 00:22:16.533
I heard they're moving the show house.

297
00:22:16.533 --> 00:22:18.263
- Let me just put this on. - Wait.

298
00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.973
I'll put it on. Give it to me.

299
00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:22.473
Here.

300
00:22:25.144 --> 00:22:26.144
Okay.

301
00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:50.134
- Hello? - Police. May I help you?

302
00:22:53.503 --> 00:22:54.674
Hello?

Go ahead. Hello?

(Apartments for sale or lease)

305
00:23:00.773 --> 00:23:02.213
He had a part-time job...

306
00:23:02.213 --> 00:23:05.213
going around the complex and putting on flyers.

307
00:23:05.314 --> 00:23:08.414
I think it was done by the same culprit.

308
00:23:10.154 --> 00:23:12.424
He used a tool in the site again,

309
00:23:12.483 --> 00:23:14.193
and murdered by striking with it.

310
00:23:15.023 --> 00:23:16.793
No other evidence is found...

311
00:23:16.793 --> 00:23:19.523
besides the dead body and the tool used for the murder.

(Date Mate)

313
00:23:21.793 --> 00:23:24.334
There's a record of accessing a dating website.

314
00:23:25.134 --> 00:23:27.174
He used the same way to lure the victim.

315
00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:30.503
The victim's appearance is different this time.

316
00:23:32.404 --> 00:23:36.114
It means the action's more important than the target...

317
00:23:36.414 --> 00:23:38.183
or while he was choosing the target,

318
00:23:38.314 --> 00:23:41.084
he couldn't endure the urge to kill.

319
00:23:41.114 --> 00:23:43.154
He left without cleaning the site...

320
00:23:43.723 --> 00:23:46.223
as if his purpose was to kill.

321
00:23:46.654 --> 00:23:50.223
It wasn't enough to fulfill his fantasy.

322
00:23:51.164 --> 00:23:54.193
There was a variable that he didn't expect.

323
00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:56.463
I checked the amount of water and electricity.

324
00:23:56.463 --> 00:23:58.864
It's found that it was used for two weeks.

325
00:23:58.963 --> 00:24:00.604
The culprit doesn't have a house.

326
00:24:00.604 --> 00:24:03.233
He keeps moving from a place to place like this.

327
00:24:03.543 --> 00:24:05.503
When the security at the show house tightened up,

328
00:24:05.973 --> 00:24:09.344
he chose this place as his scene of crime.

329

- Hello? - Team Manager Kang.

330

00:24:21.723 --> 00:24:25.523
I think I found the man Park Ji Sun testified.

332
00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:31.164
I'm tracing the surveillance cameras.

333
00:24:31.634 --> 00:24:33.473
The last place he was captured...

334
00:24:33.473 --> 00:24:36.304
was the overpass construction site in Jungwoon 7-dong.

335
00:24:36.904 --> 00:24:40.174
There's a record of him going towards the hill.

336
00:24:40.243 --> 00:24:42.874
Are there unsold apartments in that area?

337
00:24:42.874 --> 00:24:45.344
No. That's a redevelopment area. Everyone moved out,

338
00:24:45.344 --> 00:24:47.054
and the whole town's empty.

339
00:24:47.054 --> 00:24:51.283
It's annoying because it's full of teenage runaways and the homeless.

340
00:24:51.924 --> 00:24:54.394
I'll go check. Come with me please.

341
00:24:54.394 --> 00:24:55.394
Yes.

342
00:24:55.394 --> 00:24:57.424
I'll call you if I find anything.

343
00:25:04.634 --> 00:25:05.703
If...

344
00:25:06.263 --> 00:25:09.174
the culprit is homeless,

345
00:25:09.604 --> 00:25:11.674
how did he manage to pay...

346
00:25:12.074 --> 00:25:13.914
those women?

347
00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:17.314
If the first murder was impulsive and accidental,

348
00:25:17.543 --> 00:25:19.584
there's a possibility he could've...

349
00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:22.513
committed a crime beforehand to get money.

350
00:25:22.513 --> 00:25:24.683
What we must do right now is finding a suspect.

351
00:25:25.183 --> 00:25:27.223
A wandering suspect is dangerous.

352
00:25:27.953 --> 00:25:30.193
Reveal the results we have so far to the public,

353
00:25:30.193 --> 00:25:31.564
and let's get informants.

354
00:25:31.564 --> 00:25:32.723
Yes, sir.

355
00:25:38.364 --> 00:25:40.404
You'll find homeless people over there.

356
00:25:42.503 --> 00:25:43.543
Let's go.

357
00:25:56.253 --> 00:25:57.253
Excuse me.

358
00:25:58.253 --> 00:25:59.824
I have a question.

359
00:26:03.054 --> 00:26:05.824
Have you seen this person?

360
00:26:08.564 --> 00:26:11.763
It's blur. I can't see anything.

361
00:26:12.364 --> 00:26:14.574
Buy me a drink or something before you ask.

362
00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:20.013
I'm searching for a murder suspect.

363
00:26:36.493 --> 00:26:37.493
Put it down.

364
00:26:38.864 --> 00:26:39.864
Now!

365
00:27:22.104 --> 00:27:25.104
We're searching for a suspect related to the recent...

366
00:27:25.104 --> 00:27:26.743
show house murder case.

367
00:27:26.773 --> 00:27:29.943
Please listen to the following carefully,

368
00:27:30.013 --> 00:27:32.183
and if it matches the person we're looking for,

369
00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:34.953
please call the number below.

370
00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:36.384
The suspect we're looking for...

371
00:27:36.384 --> 00:27:39.324
wanders around with no place to stay.

372
00:27:39.354 --> 00:27:42.493
It's highly likely that he worked as a day laborer on construction sites,

373
00:27:42.493 --> 00:27:45.193
or any jobs similar to it.

374
00:27:45.193 --> 00:27:48.963
By the way, Kim Jin Young wanted to thank you.

375
00:27:49.263 --> 00:27:51.003
He said...

376
00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:53.374
his relationship with his wife's gotten better thanks to you.

377
00:27:54.334 --> 00:27:55.674
Don't mention it.

378
00:27:55.804 --> 00:27:58.443
It was possible because they took an active role in counseling.

379
00:27:59.543 --> 00:28:02.713
He could've been violent unpredictably.

380
00:28:02.713 --> 00:28:04.384
He shows an obsession towards...

381
00:28:04.414 --> 00:28:06.213
a shelter like a house or a show house.

382
00:28:06.213 --> 00:28:08.414
He could've wandered around the area,

383
00:28:08.414 --> 00:28:10.924
- What's wrong? - or looked inside.

384
00:28:11.183 --> 00:28:14.223
- Mr. Kang. What's wrong? - If you see anyone similar...

385
00:28:14.223 --> 00:28:15.854
to the composite sketch, please contact us.

386
00:28:16.924 --> 00:28:18.293
Where did you get this?

387
00:28:20.193 --> 00:28:22.894
It looks interesting.

388
00:28:23.804 --> 00:28:25.263
I just picked it up on a street.

389
00:28:31.374 --> 00:28:32.374
Then what's this?

390
00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:38.114
Why do you have the murder victims' belongings?

391
00:28:39.013 --> 00:28:40.013
What?

392
00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:48.854
This is all his.

393
00:28:48.854 --> 00:28:51.324
This isn't mine.

394
00:28:57.963 --> 00:28:59.164
What's his name?

395
00:29:01.374 --> 00:29:02.374
Mr. Kang.

396
00:29:04.874 --> 00:29:08.644
I don't know his name. We call them by his last name.

397
00:29:08.973 --> 00:29:10.084
Mr. Kang.

398
00:29:10.914 --> 00:29:13.513
I'm not lying. I only know his last name.

399
00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:17.384
By the way...

400
00:29:18.854 --> 00:29:20.554
why are you looking for this guy?

401
00:29:21.223 --> 00:29:23.394
He's a suspect of three murder cases.

402
00:29:23.493 --> 00:29:24.493
What?

403
00:29:25.023 --> 00:29:26.834
Murder?

404
00:29:27.594 --> 00:29:29.094
Where's he now?

405
00:29:29.864 --> 00:29:32.463
I don't know. I really don't know.

406
00:29:33.203 --> 00:29:34.874
He asked me to watch this...

407
00:29:35.433 --> 00:29:36.943
until he comes back.

408
00:29:37.174 --> 00:29:39.344
He asked me to watch this. I'm serious.

409
00:29:39.344 --> 00:29:40.844
He just asked you to watch it?

410
00:29:40.844 --> 00:29:41.874
Yes.

411
00:29:41.914 --> 00:29:43.344
Then why did you run away?

412
00:29:47.983 --> 00:29:49.354
Did you steal?

413
00:29:55.023 --> 00:29:56.293
Look, Han Gi Cheol.

414
00:29:57.894 --> 00:29:59.793
If you don't tell me the truth,

415
00:29:59.793 --> 00:30:02.634
you'd be considered as an accomplice to this crime.

416
00:30:09.404 --> 00:30:12.304
I mean...

417
00:30:13.003 --> 00:30:14.773
he cherished this.

418
00:30:15.314 --> 00:30:18.614
I became curious, so...

419
00:30:18.914 --> 00:30:22.213
I was only trying to see what's inside.

420
00:30:24.324 --> 00:30:26.253
That's all.

421
00:30:47.443 --> 00:30:48.543
Did he...

422
00:30:49.844 --> 00:30:51.443
really commit the murder...

423
00:30:52.243 --> 00:30:53.614
that happened a few days ago?

424
00:30:57.854 --> 00:30:59.253
Do you know anything?

425
00:30:59.253 --> 00:31:03.023
It's just that he doesn't look like the type.

426
00:31:03.624 --> 00:31:05.193
Never mind.

427
00:31:06.263 --> 00:31:10.164
There's a witness who saw Han Gi Cheol in the homeless shelter.

428
00:31:10.364 --> 00:31:11.463
Any other calls?

429
00:31:11.634 --> 00:31:14.104
We keep getting calls,

430
00:31:14.374 --> 00:31:17.804
but they were just men who looked similar.

431
00:31:18.773 --> 00:31:22.043
These people had no houses,

432
00:31:22.043 --> 00:31:24.844
so the informants didn't know much about them.

433
00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:32.183
Team Manager Kang, we received a report from the construction site.

434
00:31:32.753 --> 00:31:34.054
Call Sun Woo and take her with you.

435
00:31:34.193 --> 00:31:35.193
Yes, sir.

436
00:31:43.463 --> 00:31:45.033
(Apartment Construction Site)

437
00:31:52.304 --> 00:31:55.243
Wait a moment. Where did I put the file with the personal data?

438
00:31:57.614 --> 00:31:59.443
Yes, it's him.

439
00:31:59.443 --> 00:32:01.614
His name is Kang Tae Soo.

440
00:32:01.614 --> 00:32:03.983
He used to work here until a few months ago.

441
00:32:05.483 --> 00:32:07.324
Why did you think it was him?

442
00:32:07.324 --> 00:32:09.424
One of the laborers here told me...

443
00:32:09.424 --> 00:32:11.523
he looked a little similar.

444
00:32:11.664 --> 00:32:13.064
So I was reminded of him.

445
00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:16.604
By the way, he was a little strange.

446
00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:22.174
Hey, what are you doing to someone else's house?

447
00:32:22.174 --> 00:32:24.104
It's nothing.

448
00:32:24.203 --> 00:32:25.273
It's nothing.

449
00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:33.953
Gosh, I think it's nearly over.

450
00:32:35.114 --> 00:32:36.183
Aren't you going home?

451
00:32:36.483 --> 00:32:38.154
I will.

452
00:32:39.154 --> 00:32:40.554
Gosh.

453
00:32:42.854 --> 00:32:45.064
The view is so nice here.

454
00:32:45.064 --> 00:32:46.463
You can move in now.

455
00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:50.664
Who is this?

456
00:32:50.864 --> 00:32:52.834
Whenever we built a house,

457
00:32:52.834 --> 00:32:55.834
he acted as if it were his house.

458
00:32:56.604 --> 00:32:58.773
He drank a lot too.

459
00:32:58.973 --> 00:33:02.174
So I couldn't have him keep working for me anymore.

460
00:33:02.844 --> 00:33:03.844
All right.

461
00:33:03.943 --> 00:33:06.854
I checked his personal details, but his registration number is wrong.

462
00:33:06.854 --> 00:33:10.354
Some daily workers often...

463
00:33:10.453 --> 00:33:12.324
write down fake numbers.

464
00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:14.723
They all have their stories.

465
00:33:14.723 --> 00:33:16.924
So we just let them be.

466
00:33:20.033 --> 00:33:21.064
Team Manager Kang.

467
00:33:22.763 --> 00:33:23.763
All right.

468
00:33:24.634 --> 00:33:26.404
If I find something, I'll call you.

469
00:33:27.203 --> 00:33:28.233
Okay.

470
00:33:32.604 --> 00:33:33.674
(Pictures from the Crime Scene)

471
00:33:37.243 --> 00:33:38.243
(Pictures from the Crime Scene)

472
00:33:43.824 --> 00:33:46.554
The first incident shows that he was impulsive,

473
00:33:46.584 --> 00:33:50.564
but the second incident shows that the murder was planned.

474
00:33:51.993 --> 00:33:53.023
What is it?

475
00:33:53.293 --> 00:33:54.664
- Team Manager Kang, - Yes?

476
00:33:55.094 --> 00:33:57.763
Someone is here saying that the culprit is his younger brother.

477
00:34:06.443 --> 00:34:08.943
Are you sure it's your brother?

478
00:34:09.813 --> 00:34:13.114
Yes, I think it's my brother.

479
00:34:16.853 --> 00:34:17.924
Here.

480
00:34:30.163 --> 00:34:32.264
- I'm Kang Ki Hyung. - I'm Kang Dong Joo.

481
00:34:32.603 --> 00:34:33.603
Team Manager Kang.

482
00:34:38.773 --> 00:34:41.043
His name is Kang Dong Min.

483
00:34:42.174 --> 00:34:44.313
Where is he?

484
00:34:45.184 --> 00:34:48.413
To be honest, I was looking for him.

485
00:34:51.853 --> 00:34:54.123
Until a few months ago, he often called me.

486
00:34:55.853 --> 00:34:57.324
I didn't know that he lived on the streets.

487
00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:00.994
But...

488
00:35:01.793 --> 00:35:04.034
are you sure my brother is the culprit?

489
00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:10.744
It's true that he is the most likely suspect as of now.

490
00:35:15.974 --> 00:35:19.583
Is there a reason why you think it's him?

491
00:35:30.963 --> 00:35:34.793
We used to move around a lot since we were young.

492
00:35:34.793 --> 00:35:38.733
Dong Joo, Dad makes houses, right?

493
00:35:38.833 --> 00:35:41.003
But why don't we have a house of our own?

494
00:35:41.174 --> 00:35:43.003
I heard that we will move soon.

495
00:35:55.313 --> 00:35:57.253
Give one to me, Mom.

496
00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:11.534
Mom always said that she was sick of her life.

497
00:36:11.934 --> 00:36:13.163
- One day, she left home. - Dong Joo,

498
00:36:13.163 --> 00:36:15.773
do these lights come from houses?

499
00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.773
Yes. Do you see the apartment over there?

500
00:36:19.074 --> 00:36:20.514
Dad told me...

501
00:36:20.674 --> 00:36:23.684
that we will live in one of those houses.

502
00:36:23.813 --> 00:36:26.083
That's exciting! Will we have beds?

503
00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:44.603
We finally got a leased apartment,

504
00:36:44.963 --> 00:36:46.534
and we were going to move there.

505
00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:50.574
I found out later...

506
00:36:51.443 --> 00:36:53.643
- that Mom had stolen the money... - Dad.

507
00:36:53.643 --> 00:36:55.244
- and run away with another man. - Dad.

508
00:36:55.244 --> 00:36:56.273
Dad.

509
00:36:57.083 --> 00:36:59.114
- Dad committed suicide. - Dad.

510
00:36:59.543 --> 00:37:02.083
- Dad. - We barely survived.

511
00:37:02.884 --> 00:37:04.284
My family...

512
00:37:05.123 --> 00:37:08.154
was destroyed so quickly.

513
00:37:08.924 --> 00:37:11.023
Maybe that's why he's obsessed with houses.

514
00:37:11.764 --> 00:37:14.963
He could have thought that Mom had run away...

515
00:37:16.733 --> 00:37:19.663
and Dad had committed suicide because we didn't have a house.

516
00:37:21.733 --> 00:37:23.003
After that,

517
00:37:24.373 --> 00:37:26.204
Dong Min seemed to be lost.

518
00:37:26.813 --> 00:37:30.913
When did you last see your brother?

519
00:37:31.284 --> 00:37:32.614
10 days ago.

520
00:37:33.014 --> 00:37:35.853
I heard he was around Mohyeon-dong, so I went there.

521
00:37:36.284 --> 00:37:37.924
It was too dark to see,

522
00:37:38.684 --> 00:37:39.853
but someone...

523
00:37:44.224 --> 00:37:46.634
Someone was watching me.

524
00:37:48.364 --> 00:37:52.404
I think that was Dong Min.

525
00:37:56.603 --> 00:37:57.674
- Team Manager Kang, - Yes.

526
00:37:57.674 --> 00:37:59.904
I had Ms. Park check Park Dong Min's face...

527
00:37:59.904 --> 00:38:01.313
with his picture.

528
00:38:01.443 --> 00:38:03.313
I think he was the culprit.

529
00:38:03.543 --> 00:38:05.184
Give out his identifications and pictures...

530
00:38:05.543 --> 00:38:08.384
and make sure to increase surveillance around Mohyeon-dong,

531
00:38:08.583 --> 00:38:09.884
where the homeless are staying.

532
00:38:10.023 --> 00:38:11.184
Yes, sir.

533
00:38:42.489 --> 00:38:44.719
Excuse me,

534
00:38:45.989 --> 00:38:47.130
do you know who he is?

535
00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:49.730
Yes.

536
00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:52.300
I saw him a week ago.

537
00:38:53.429 --> 00:38:54.929
He was wearing the same clothes.

538
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.630
Gosh.

539
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.409
Mister, grab the bottle and come here.

540
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.750
Let's drink together.

541
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.519
What?

542
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.190
Didn't he say anything?

543
00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.489
I asked him to pick it up,

544
00:39:20.389 --> 00:39:22.559
but he glared at me and went away.

545
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.260
Before that, he couldn't even look me in the eye.

546
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.170
He seemed to have earned some money as he looked great.

547
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.340
I was shocked...

548
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.469
when I found out that he had killed three people.

549
00:39:39.809 --> 00:39:40.809
Excuse me.

550
00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:43.780
What is that person doing?

551
00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.389
He's just telling people what to do.

552
00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.119
The cross means...

553
00:39:50.789 --> 00:39:53.320
that the church in this village gives out good food.

554
00:39:54.059 --> 00:39:57.960
The triangle means that there's a patrol around there.

555
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.130
We try to help each other out by giving signs.

556
00:40:02.599 --> 00:40:05.440
What's that sign next to the cross?

557
00:40:06.099 --> 00:40:08.670
That's not our sign.

558
00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:12.239
Some weird guy must have drawn that to confuse us.

559
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.949
It looks like a plumb.

560
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.980
The murderer left a mark...

561
00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.449
to show that it's his house wherever he stayed.

562
00:40:21.789 --> 00:40:23.250
If we follow these marks,

563
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:26.190
we might be able to find Kang Dong Min's whereabouts.

564
00:40:26.519 --> 00:40:27.530
Yes, Team Manager Kang.

565
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.699
We found a mark left behind by Kang Dong Min.

566
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:35.400
Yes. Understood.

567
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:22.210
Why are you investigating this?

568
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.150
The NFS already checked and found out that the DNA...

569
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:26.750
belongs to Kang Dong Min.

570
00:41:27.519 --> 00:41:30.920
A car black box also captured him coming in here.

571
00:41:30.989 --> 00:41:34.530
There was a soju bottle and a burnt butane gas container.

572
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.500
Kang Dong Min must have ran out of money,

573
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.829
so he was trying to find a replacement for the drugs.

574
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.099
That is what the police assumed.

575
00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:46.070
Most fires spread from the point of origin by following oxygen.

576
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:49.239
However, what's left here...

577
00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.039
looks like the fire engulfed the place instantly, then went out.

578
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.820
The fire started over there,

579
00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.079
but the fire went out as fast as it spread.

580
00:42:21.809 --> 00:42:22.869
It's gasoline.

581
00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:27.250
Someone had sprayed gasoline all over here.

582
00:42:33.889 --> 00:42:34.889
Team Manager Kang.

583
00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:37.519
At the scene of the first murder two months ago,

584
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.690
the murderer left the victim as she was...

585
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.159
and fled the scene.

586
00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:42.960
The blood stains were all there.

587
00:42:43.289 --> 00:42:46.460
It's likely that the crime was impulsive and unplanned.

588
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.800
Meanwhile, the second murder...

589
00:42:48.869 --> 00:42:51.699
didn't leave a trace. It was perfectly controlled.

590
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.409
Do you really think they're the same person?

591
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.980
There's something else that's different.

592
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.449
The murderer of the second case took drugs...

593
00:43:00.449 --> 00:43:03.250
and committed the crime while being under the influence.

594
00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:07.090
However, we didn't find any traces of drugs in the first one.

595
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:11.059
This time, the victim's characteristics are different.

596
00:43:13.289 --> 00:43:14.289
Yes.

597
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:19.000
Sir, Nana found something.

598
00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:21.329
September 3.

599
00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:24.900
Some homeless people had a fight near an underground passage.

600
00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:27.639
I was searching for something else in the region...

601
00:43:27.639 --> 00:43:29.840
when I coincidentally noticed this on CCTV.

602
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.980
I thought it was a little strange, so I retrieved the video.

603
00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.250
Do you see that?

604
00:43:34.809 --> 00:43:38.320
The man in black with a knife is Han Gi Cheol.

605
00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:41.090
The one with the hat is Kang Dong Min.

606
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.090
It says September 3rd, which is 55 days ago from today.

607
00:43:44.219 --> 00:43:47.329
It's just four days after the first murder in the show house.

608
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:51.699
But if you look at the footages of Kang Dong Min take later...

609
00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.800
It doesn't look like he was injured.

610
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.800
That's right.

611
00:43:59.869 --> 00:44:01.369
Something is off.

612
00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:04.579
As soon as we found out his address, there was a fire.

613
00:44:05.139 --> 00:44:08.079
What if someone is behind it and is controlling everything?

614
00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.820
Do you remember what Kang Dong Jun looked like when he came to us?

615
00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.449
His eyes were red.

616
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.690
His lips were parched. He kept on drinking water.

617
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.889
He kept on wiping the sweat from his palms.

618
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.429
Those are common characteristics of a drug addict.

619
00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:29.829
- That means... - My goodness.

620
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.800
Send this to Hyun Jun.

621
00:44:32.969 --> 00:44:34.869
Look into Kang Dong Jun again.

622
00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:36.909
Family relations, properties,

623
00:44:36.909 --> 00:44:38.380
drug dealings,

624
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:40.579
and even where he lives.

625
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:41.750
Yes, sir.

626
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.309
You two, come with me.

627
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:44.320
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

628
00:44:45.679 --> 00:44:46.750
Yes.

629
00:44:47.019 --> 00:44:49.050
We found evidence of arson...

630
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.820
where they found the body of Kang Dong Min.

631
00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:54.590
Pardon?

632
00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:58.860
I see.

633
00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:00.699
I'll call you after I check.

634
00:45:00.929 --> 00:45:03.369
I looked into what you requested.

635
00:45:03.639 --> 00:45:07.110
Kang Dong Jun is currently going through a divorce.

636
00:45:08.369 --> 00:45:11.679
It looks like there were a lot of problems between them.

637
00:45:12.179 --> 00:45:14.179
They filed a lawsuit for property division.

638
00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.909
However, he's in a lot of debt,

639
00:45:15.909 --> 00:45:18.750
so their house is already no longer with them.

640
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:20.150
Okay. Great job.

641
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.119
Okay.

642
00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:29.059
Sir, Kang Dong Jun is currently at a consultation center.

643
00:45:29.289 --> 00:45:32.260
Could it have been him all along?

644
00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:36.000
I think it's his brother Kang Dong Min who committed the first murder.

645
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:37.500
However, for some reason,

646
00:45:37.769 --> 00:45:40.269
he could no longer commit crimes.

647
00:45:40.639 --> 00:45:43.909
Because a few days later, Kang Dong Min was injured by a knife.

648
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:47.550
Kang Dong Jun must have found his dying brother...

649
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:49.579
and realized that he committed murder.

650
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.550
That's probably when he started his plan.

651
00:45:52.679 --> 00:45:54.289
He acted like his dead brother...

652
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:56.090
and committed the same crimes.

653
00:46:17.079 --> 00:46:20.610
He must have copied his brother up to the second one.

654
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.380
He chose his victims...

655
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.880
because of his hatred towards his mother.

656
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.619
That way, the police would continue to chase the dead Kang Dong Min.

657
00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.690
After that, Kang Dong Jun became confident.

658
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:31.190
From the third murder,

659
00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.929
he chose his own targets...

660
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:36.699
and changed the location to empty apartments.

661
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:41.599
The victims were probably similar to his wife.

662
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:44.170
That's when the case turned public.

663
00:46:44.539 --> 00:46:47.570
Since he couldn't hide anymore, he came to us.

664
00:46:49.369 --> 00:46:51.940
He made us find traces of Kang Dong Min...

665
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.849
and started a fire to close the case.

666
00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.360
The brothers grew up in the same environment,

667
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.230
so they shared the same trauma.

668
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.329
They both must have suffered the urge to murder.

669
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:49.599
Unlike how he seemed,

670
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.170
Kang Dong Jun's current life wasn't that much different from Dong Min.

671
00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.710
We were...

672
00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:57.309
chasing a ghost all this time.

673
00:47:57.309 --> 00:47:58.980
(Cozy Psychology Consultation Center)

674
00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.980
Come in.

675
00:48:02.409 --> 00:48:04.050
I heard that you were coming.

676
00:48:04.579 --> 00:48:06.119
Yes. Here.

677
00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:09.550
I forgot to give this to you last time.

678
00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:20.500
When we were young,

679
00:48:21.469 --> 00:48:23.969
our father gave this to Dong Min as a present.

680
00:48:26.639 --> 00:48:28.739
You didn't have to bring it yourself. Thank you.

681
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.039
It's nothing. I was just passing by.

682
00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.280
Please sit down.

683
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.949
Okay.

684
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.559
You must be heartbroken.

685
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:49.789
I'm okay.

686
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.900
When I think of the victims,

687
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.469
I feel guilty thinking of being heartbroken.

688
00:48:58.469 --> 00:49:00.739
You seem to be close with your family.

689
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:06.480
Yes. My son loves to follow me around.

690
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.010
It's really tiring.

691
00:49:08.179 --> 00:49:10.550
Your wife is beautiful.

692
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:12.119
Thank you.

693
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:13.750
Then...

694
00:49:14.519 --> 00:49:16.489
is the case closed now?

695
00:49:19.559 --> 00:49:22.260
It turns out that the fire could have been arson.

696
00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.059
We're under investigation.

697
00:49:24.099 --> 00:49:25.530
It'll be closed soon.

698
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.130
Arson?

699
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.139
Does that mean someone purposefully started a fire?

700
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.639
It's only a possibility for now.

701
00:49:33.269 --> 00:49:34.710
If it turns out to be true,

702
00:49:34.869 --> 00:49:37.280
that means the person could be an accomplice.

703
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.039
That's what we're focusing on...

704
00:49:39.639 --> 00:49:40.849
in our investigation.

705
00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:42.679
I see.

706
00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.789
We'll let you know if we find anything.

707
00:49:52.159 --> 00:49:53.960
You must be busy. We'll get going.

708
00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.260
Okay.

709
00:50:07.369 --> 00:50:09.510
Kang Dong Jun started to react.

710
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.110
It looked like he wanted to ask more about it, but stopped himself.

711
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.550
He'll now take action.

712
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.179
He could destroy evidence if there's any.

713
00:50:19.519 --> 00:50:20.849
That's the moment we're aiming for.

714
00:50:37.639 --> 00:50:40.239
I already told you everything.

715
00:50:41.039 --> 00:50:42.070
Look closely.

716
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.510
Do you want to be responsible for all murdered women?

717
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.210
No. No.

718
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.320
I'm sorry.

719
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.849
I'm sorry.

720
00:50:52.179 --> 00:50:54.489
I didn't do it on purpose.

Why did you hang up?

724

Don't yell. I'm not asking you to put the child on the phone.

It's nothing like that!

728
00:51:23.949 --> 00:51:25.949
I said... Hello?

729
00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:28.250
Hello? Hey! Hey!

730
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:31.690
Darn it.

Darn it. Darn it!

Your mother left you a piece of property before she died.

733
00:51:54.409 --> 00:51:57.380
You need consent from your sibling to sell it.

in the house that I built,

778

your brother was better off dead?

791
00:58:05.512 --> 00:58:07.083
Is that why you killed your brother...

792

You can't even support your family for months now.

You just...

812

wanted to escape the dump you're living in.

816
00:59:19.313 --> 00:59:20.952
Shut your mouth.

01:00:07.733 --> 01:00:09.632
Just like what you said,

833
01:00:09.762 --> 01:00:12.003
you're just a lowlife murderer.

834
01:00:17.713 --> 01:00:18.713
Hey.

835
01:00:20.282 --> 01:00:21.342
Wait there.

836
01:00:21.742 --> 01:00:22.882
Wait!

837
01:00:29.683 --> 01:00:30.693
Hey!

838
01:00:31.922 --> 01:00:33.422
What do you know?

839
01:00:33.822 --> 01:00:34.963
What do you know?

840
01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:38.393
- You don't know anything. - I have the primary DNA results.

841
01:00:38.393 --> 01:00:41.233
Several bloodstains of recent victims were found from...

842
01:00:41.233 --> 01:00:43.532
Kang Dong Min's clothes that Kang Dong Jun was wearing.

843
01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:48.773
It's clear that he committed the crime.

844
01:00:49.043 --> 01:00:50.742
But he doesn't seem to repent.

845
01:00:53.512 --> 01:00:59.952
(I feel worn out every day. It's so exhausting.)

846
01:01:01.552 --> 01:01:03.652
"Good did not separate..."

847
01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:06.893
"happy families from unhappy families."

848
01:01:07.722 --> 01:01:08.992
"But men cannot..."

849
01:01:09.592 --> 01:01:11.862
"free themselves from them."

850
01:01:12.693 --> 01:01:13.933
Fyodor Dostoevsky.

851
01:01:34.683 --> 01:01:37.922
The culprit raped the victims multiple times.

852
01:01:38.353 --> 01:01:41.693
Can you tell me about what happened last night?

853
01:01:41.693 --> 01:01:44.733
When I close my eyes, I can see his face.

854
01:01:44.733 --> 01:01:46.233
There's a witness to the message.

855
01:01:46.233 --> 01:01:48.163
The culprit made the victim see his face...

856
01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:50.032
and expressed his violent anger.

857
01:01:50.032 --> 01:01:51.572
What does that mean?

858
01:01:52.032 --> 01:01:55.003
The culprit will be choosing his next target.

859
01:01:55.072 --> 01:01:57.543
We need to move before he does.

860
01:01:59.043 --> 01:02:02.413
Promise me that you will arrest him.

861
01:02:02.413 --> 01:02:03.753
I promise.
