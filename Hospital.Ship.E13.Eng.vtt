<i>[Episode 13]</i>
Where's San? Huh?

3
00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:12.673
I don't see San!

4
00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:15.325
- Hurry!
- Hyun!

5
00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:18.720
- Yes?
- He's not here! San isn't here!

6
00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:21.738
- San isn't here?
- He isn't.

7
00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.160
San! Kang San!

8
00:00:30.183 --> 00:00:31.519
San!

9
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:07.312
What do we do?

10
00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:10.443
Doctor!

11
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:12.720
Doctor!

12
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:18.490
Doctor Kwak! Doctor Kwak!

13
00:01:22.552 --> 00:01:26.397
Doctor Kwak! Doctor Kwak!

14
00:01:28.223 --> 00:01:29.860
Are you all right?

15
00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:33.482
What about the patient?
How's the patient?

16
00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:39.497
My leg is caught,
so I can't carry him out.

17
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.915
San. Kang San. San!

18
00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:49.472
It's okay. I'll get you out of here.

19
00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:57.577
San, what's wrong? San, wake up! San!

20
00:01:57.577 --> 00:02:00.196
What is it? What's the matter?

21
00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:05.304
He's not breathing.
His pulse is too weak from the shock.

22
00:02:05.304 --> 00:02:06.923
Does he have subcutaneous emphysema?

23
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.016
No!

24
00:02:24.862 --> 00:02:27.957
- I think it's pericardial tamponade.
- We have to intubate!

25
00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:31.469
If we don't intubate and release
the pressure, we could lose him!

26
00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:55.637
This... take this.

27
00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.394
- Doctor!
- Doctor, are you all right?

28
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.334
Don't be scared. You can do it.

29
00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:09.233
- What are you doing?
- You can't go inside.

30
00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:12.787
He's right. Look at this right here.

31
00:03:12.787 --> 00:03:15.967
No one can go inside until the rescue
team removes all fire hazards.

32
00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:18.217
Are you telling me to leave
the patient like that?

33
00:03:24.163 --> 00:03:25.779
- Let me do it.
- Doctor!

34
00:03:28.864 --> 00:03:30.097
Hold on.

35
00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:35.882
Geez, they should hurry.
What are they doing?

36
00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:58.900
<i>I can do it. I can do it.</i>

37
00:04:03.346 --> 00:04:05.166
The defibrillator!

38
00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:06.508
Clear!

39
00:04:08.138 --> 00:04:11.114
- Can you call yourself a doctor?
- Interns don't even make that mistake.

40
00:04:11.114 --> 00:04:13.750
The patient died because of you.

41
00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:28.195
Doctor Kwak. Doctor Kwak!

42
00:04:33.312 --> 00:04:34.788
I don't think I can do it.

43
00:04:35.824 --> 00:04:37.901
- I can't do it.
- Look at me.

44
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:41.007
- I can't do it, so...
- I said, look at me!

45
00:04:42.675 --> 00:04:45.555
Breathe slowly.

46
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.562
Take a deep breath and calm down.

47
00:04:56.637 --> 00:04:58.904
The person who's here right now...

48
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.712
isn't the same person from yesterday.

49
00:05:02.315 --> 00:05:05.036
The person who's right here...

50
00:05:05.036 --> 00:05:07.629
worked hard to avoid failure

51
00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.015
by practicing day in and day out.

52
00:05:11.988 --> 00:05:15.343
<i>You're the hard-working doctor
of internal medicine, Kwak Hyun.</i>

53
00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:19.315
And outside...

54
00:05:19.315 --> 00:05:22.808
there's a patient
I wanted to save so badly.

55
00:05:24.288 --> 00:05:27.197
And the teacher you loved
as much as your father.

56
00:05:28.084 --> 00:05:30.933
Teacher Seol Jae Chan is waiting for us.

57
00:05:31.812 --> 00:05:36.452
Today, is the very last field trip...

58
00:05:38.158 --> 00:05:40.091
that Seol Jae Chan can go on.

59
00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.642
We can't make him lose a student

60
00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:46.483
on his last field trip.

61
00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:49.841
You can do it.

62
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:52.457
Don't use your brain.

63
00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:57.158
Just... let your muscle memory...

64
00:05:58.764 --> 00:06:00.151
do the work.

65
00:07:42.694 --> 00:07:44.120
Gauze.

66
00:07:55.714 --> 00:07:58.420
His pulse is back to normal.

67
00:08:01.284 --> 00:08:03.473
You worked hard, Doctor Kwak.

68
00:08:04.497 --> 00:08:06.286
You...

69
00:08:07.714 --> 00:08:10.046
saved this patient.

70
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.468
He's alive right? He will live, right?

71
00:08:35.468 --> 00:08:39.620
Yes. Although, he can't
go on the field trip today.

72
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.042
Wow, our Hyun is a real doctor now.

73
00:08:54.672 --> 00:08:58.269
If your father knew about this,
he'd be so proud.

74
00:08:58.269 --> 00:09:00.708
I wonder how he's doing.

75
00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:08.503
Would you... like to meet Father?

76
00:09:20.346 --> 00:09:23.664
He's... over there.

77
00:09:31.492 --> 00:09:33.657
He might not recognize you.

78
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:38.510
His condition has gotten worse
in the last few days.

79
00:09:51.006 --> 00:09:53.572
Hey! Friend!

80
00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:57.736
Hey, Kwak Sung!

81
00:10:01.703 --> 00:10:03.202
It's me.

82
00:10:05.775 --> 00:10:08.191
It's me, Jae Chan.

83
00:10:12.881 --> 00:10:15.477
- Sung!
- You punk!

84
00:10:15.477 --> 00:10:18.444
Do you remember me? I'm Jae Chan!

85
00:10:18.444 --> 00:10:22.355
Geez! You recognize me!

86
00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:24.924
That's right. It's me, Jae Chan.

87
00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:30.681
You punk. I didn't know
you'd recognize me...

88
00:10:33.947 --> 00:10:36.693
How long has it been?

89
00:10:37.571 --> 00:10:41.456
Geez, thank you. You recognize me.

90
00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:45.011
But...

91
00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:47.851
who's that?

92
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:51.106
- Is he your son?
- What in the world?

93
00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.146
You've...

94
00:11:00.146 --> 00:11:04.542
gone through a lot of hardships,
haven't you?

95
00:11:04.542 --> 00:11:08.266
You punk, seriously...

96
00:11:09.816 --> 00:11:12.625
It's okay. It's okay.

97
00:11:14.145 --> 00:11:17.798
Geez, what a difficult illness.

98
00:11:18.472 --> 00:11:22.663
He immediately recognizes
his friend from 20 years ago...

99
00:11:23.322 --> 00:11:29.038
yet he doesn't remember his son
who visits him every day.

100
00:11:32.337 --> 00:11:34.038
It makes you sad, doesn't it?

101
00:11:36.474 --> 00:11:38.529
I'm fine.

102
00:11:46.745 --> 00:11:51.489
After I wrap things up at school,
I'll transfer here.

103
00:11:51.489 --> 00:11:56.138
You said you wanted to stay home.
You made all the preparations.

104
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.938
I changed my mind.

105
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.779
Is it because of me?

106
00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:04.793
Are you worried it'll be hard for me?

107
00:12:08.409 --> 00:12:10.899
If I knew you'd feel burdened...

108
00:12:11.537 --> 00:12:13.532
I wouldn't have brought you here.

109
00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:19.224
Hey, it's not like that.
I want to be with my friend.

110
00:12:19.941 --> 00:12:24.335
I won't be lonely at the end.
How great is that?

111
00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:25.794
Don't you think?

112
00:12:35.818 --> 00:12:39.050

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

113
00:12:47.905 --> 00:12:51.602
- You're early.
- Just by 20 minutes.

114
00:12:52.354 --> 00:12:54.549
- What's this?
- Jae Geol forgot it.

115
00:12:54.549 --> 00:12:57.265
At the hospital?
Why did he leave his gown there?

116
00:12:57.265 --> 00:12:59.950
He's pretending to be a doctor
when he isn't.

117
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.226
- Who's pretending?
- Get me some water.

118
00:13:03.462 --> 00:13:07.284
- Get me some water!
- Gosh, my heart.

119
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.029
What is going on here?

120
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.706
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

121
00:13:21.706 --> 00:13:25.457
Why are you so down?
You worked hard back there.

122
00:13:25.457 --> 00:13:29.090
You even fixed her arm.
Wasn't it exciting?

123
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.485
Patients avoided
becoming crippled thanks to you.

124
00:13:40.082 --> 00:13:43.506
- Myun Soo, get an X-ray of his leg!
- Yes, I'm on it!

125
00:13:44.075 --> 00:13:46.162
Another patient coming in!

126
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.288
An accident? Where?
How badly are they hurt?

127
00:13:52.288 --> 00:13:55.967
- Let's start with that patient first.
- Yeah, let's check him out.

128
00:13:59.462 --> 00:14:01.879
He looks like a bright kid.

129
00:14:05.765 --> 00:14:10.457
Hey... you did a very good job
with emergency measures.

130
00:14:10.457 --> 00:14:13.342
I'm sure you couldn't have
done this with your arm.

131
00:14:13.342 --> 00:14:15.668
- Was it the doctor of internal medicine?
- No.

132
00:14:15.668 --> 00:14:18.035
It was the hospital ship's
doctor of oriental medicine...

133
00:14:19.722 --> 00:14:21.629
<i>[Kim Jae Geol]</i>

134
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:24.295
Are you... saying Jae Geol did this?

135
00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:26.669
- Yes.
- That too?

136
00:14:26.669 --> 00:14:28.086
- Of course.
- Wow.

137
00:14:28.086 --> 00:14:33.986
It must run in the family.
There's a difference. Look at his skills.

138
00:14:33.986 --> 00:14:37.010
And look at how he wrapped
him up with his gown.

139
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.429
- His quick actions...
- What quick actions?

140
00:14:41.168 --> 00:14:43.414
He just got lucky!

141
00:14:44.908 --> 00:14:48.135
Geez, Director Kim...

142
00:14:50.549 --> 00:14:55.124
Well, I think we should
get an X-ray first.

143
00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:02.732
<i>- Jae Geol, where are we going?
- Busan.</i>

144
00:15:02.732 --> 00:15:06.735
<i>- Why Busan?
- To spend the old man's money!</i>

145
00:15:24.514 --> 00:15:27.879
Here it is! Let's have a fun time!

146
00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:30.990
- The food is here!
- Cheers!

147
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.998
He said he'll take responsibility
for all of it.

148
00:15:33.998 --> 00:15:36.029
Isn't he just bluffing?

149
00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:38.947
He said it too confidently to be a bluff.

150
00:15:38.947 --> 00:15:41.861
- You must come here often.
- Not so much these days.

151
00:15:41.861 --> 00:15:44.269
- Why?
- We're busy.

152
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:47.087
- What were you doing?
- Treating patients.

153
00:15:47.087 --> 00:15:48.793
A doctor?

154
00:15:49.905 --> 00:15:51.643
Both of you.

155
00:15:51.643 --> 00:15:53.491
- What kind of doctor?
- Guess.

156
00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:56.542
Is it... cosmetic surgery?

157
00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:00.895
- Why?
- You look sharp.

158
00:16:00.895 --> 00:16:03.271
- You're wrong.
- He's not?

159
00:16:03.271 --> 00:16:05.321
Then, what kind of doctor is he?

160
00:16:05.321 --> 00:16:07.027
It's unimaginable.

161
00:16:09.952 --> 00:16:12.088
- Why?
- What?

162
00:16:12.088 --> 00:16:14.005
Why is it unimaginable?

163
00:16:15.952 --> 00:16:19.302
Are you looking down on oriental medicine
too? We're not even doctors, huh?

164
00:16:19.302 --> 00:16:21.547
Hey, that's not it.

165
00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:24.547
Jae Geol! Jae Geol!

166
00:16:38.792 --> 00:16:41.304
Geez, why are you embarrassing me
by coming out here?

167
00:16:41.304 --> 00:16:43.179
Are you capable of feeling embarrassed?

168
00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:47.207
- What about the girls?
- They told me to bring you back.

169
00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:50.684
They said it'd be nice to date you
and get free tonic for life.

170
00:16:52.837 --> 00:16:55.284
Who said that doctors of
oriental medicine aren't doctors?

171
00:16:55.284 --> 00:16:58.711
- My old man.
- Old men are like that.

172
00:16:58.711 --> 00:17:00.463
Have you seen
any old man liking their son?

173
00:17:00.463 --> 00:17:02.837
Geez, seriously.

174
00:17:03.658 --> 00:17:05.403
- Let's go inside.
- Why?

175
00:17:05.403 --> 00:17:07.787
Aren't you going to whine
about your back pain tomorrow?

176
00:17:07.787 --> 00:17:10.263
Why are you worried?
You can give me acupuncture.

177
00:17:10.263 --> 00:17:14.023
- You punk.
- Let's go inside.

178
00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:17.852
Geez, seriously. Geez...

179
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.696
Is your arm better?

180
00:17:55.337 --> 00:17:57.896
I asked if your arm is okay.

181
00:17:58.931 --> 00:18:00.911
As you can see, it is.

182
00:18:00.911 --> 00:18:04.262
What are you listening to?
Is it music?

183
00:18:04.262 --> 00:18:05.643
It's similar to music.

184
00:18:05.643 --> 00:18:08.259
Is there a singer or genre that you like?

185
00:18:08.259 --> 00:18:10.297
No, there isn't.

186
00:18:11.874 --> 00:18:15.443
What are you doing tomorrow?
You're not working in the ER, right?

187
00:18:15.443 --> 00:18:18.627
- Why?
- Want to go to Maemuldo?

188
00:18:18.627 --> 00:18:22.554
- I know a famous restaurant.
- I don't like famous restaurants.

189
00:18:22.554 --> 00:18:26.055
Their soy sauce crab is amazing.
You like soy sauce crab.

190
00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:29.892
Who told you I like soy sauce crab?

191
00:18:29.892 --> 00:18:31.456
You did.

192
00:18:31.456 --> 00:18:36.886
I noticed you eating it whole last time.
You even licked all your fingers.

193
00:18:37.853 --> 00:18:41.025
- You'll go, right?
- No.

194
00:18:41.025 --> 00:18:43.720
I wouldn't go out of my way for it.

195
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.496
Maemuldo is close.
It's only a 30 minute boat ride.

196
00:18:47.496 --> 00:18:53.606
15 minutes. If it's not within
a 15 minute distance, I'll decline.

197
00:18:53.606 --> 00:18:55.933
You should extend that
by another 15 minutes.

198
00:18:58.912 --> 00:19:00.939
It's because I'm thankful.

199
00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:02.357
For what?

200
00:19:03.814 --> 00:19:07.276
This hand became a doctor again
thanks to you.

201
00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:10.378
I want to repay you for it.

202
00:19:15.456 --> 00:19:19.778
Fine, then tell me what you want.
I'll do whatever you want.

203
00:19:19.778 --> 00:19:23.887
- Really?
- Is there anything you want from me?

204
00:19:25.042 --> 00:19:28.299
- Yes.
- What is it?

205
00:19:31.218 --> 00:19:33.815
This...

206
00:19:33.815 --> 00:19:36.747
Do you recognize it?

207
00:19:37.935 --> 00:19:41.240
- They're my surgeries.
- You're right.

208
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.843
I tried to bring your surgeries
back into the light.

209
00:19:49.309 --> 00:19:53.938
This... is a root graft surgery.

210
00:19:53.938 --> 00:19:58.885
And this is a lacerated wound
caused by a bullet.

211
00:19:59.721 --> 00:20:01.628
And this...

212
00:20:04.906 --> 00:20:07.000
- Why?
- Pardon?

213
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.672
Why did you meticulously
restore my surgeries?

214
00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:14.038
Are you planning to practice
in troubled areas?

215
00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:18.488
I'm not. I haven't thought of
doing that yet.

216
00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:20.083
Then...

217
00:20:20.083 --> 00:20:26.048
The places where I work are becoming
as dangerous as troubled areas.

218
00:20:26.048 --> 00:20:31.015
There are many times when I have to skip
between departments. Just like you.

219
00:20:32.017 --> 00:20:34.884
In 21st century Korea?

220
00:20:34.884 --> 00:20:38.833
Yes, in 21st century Korea.

221
00:20:38.833 --> 00:20:40.911
- That's why...
- That's why?

222
00:20:41.661 --> 00:20:45.171
I want to learn what you know.

223
00:20:45.171 --> 00:20:48.095
There weren't many cases in the journals

224
00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:51.692
so I was wondering if you saved
your other cases elsewhere.

225
00:20:51.692 --> 00:20:55.384
- Did you bring your laptop?
- Yes.

226
00:21:14.788 --> 00:21:16.249
Here.

227
00:21:20.494 --> 00:21:24.759
What's your password?
If I want to see your surgery cases

228
00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:26.825
I need your password.

229
00:21:26.825 --> 00:21:28.634
860920.

230
00:21:30.111 --> 00:21:31.430
Pardon?

231
00:21:32.248 --> 00:21:34.484
What's your password?

232
00:21:36.002 --> 00:21:38.336
860920.

233
00:21:39.814 --> 00:21:43.173
Is there any special meaning to that...

234
00:21:44.113 --> 00:21:45.854
password?

235
00:21:47.502 --> 00:21:49.545
It's your birthday.

236
00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:52.740
You punk, don't you know
your own birthday?

237
00:21:53.701 --> 00:21:58.060
You... remember me?

238
00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.830
Hey, what father wouldn't
recognize his own son?

239
00:22:06.067 --> 00:22:10.179
I know, right? You're right, Father.

240
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.819
Hyun.

241
00:22:14.987 --> 00:22:18.516
- Yes?
- Did something happen to me?

242
00:22:20.061 --> 00:22:22.933
Why did I suddenly come back to Korea?

243
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:26.883
And where are we?

244
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:03.885
Isn't it nice to be outside?

245
00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:20.171
You must have had
a hard time by yourself.

246
00:23:21.429 --> 00:23:24.625
I didn't. I had Mom.

247
00:23:25.257 --> 00:23:28.898
I know what your mother is like.

248
00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:37.444
Did I... ever tell you...

249
00:23:37.444 --> 00:23:39.555
that I'm sorry?

250
00:23:40.309 --> 00:23:41.686
Father.

251
00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:45.646
I'm sorry.

252
00:23:48.618 --> 00:23:52.711
The truth is, I couldn't handle your mom.

253
00:23:53.346 --> 00:23:56.013
She told me to be a competent doctor.

254
00:23:56.686 --> 00:24:00.411
She said I needed to be
a competent doctor.

255
00:24:01.038 --> 00:24:03.577
She pressured me a lot.

256
00:24:03.577 --> 00:24:09.328
But as you know, she meant
she wanted me to make a lot of money.

257
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.462
At times...

258
00:24:16.223 --> 00:24:19.529
your mother looked like a witch.

259
00:24:29.357 --> 00:24:31.099
The truth is...

260
00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:37.660
I ran away.

261
00:24:39.698 --> 00:24:42.599
It wasn't to become a good doctor.

262
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.658
And it wasn't because I wanted to
devote myself to my patients.

263
00:24:48.658 --> 00:24:51.581
I knew the marriage wasn't right

264
00:24:51.581 --> 00:24:53.898
but I didn't have the guts
to break it off.

265
00:24:55.686 --> 00:25:00.369
That's why...
I did many bad things to you.

266
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.089
You weren't even 20 years old.

267
00:25:07.356 --> 00:25:11.579
But you took care of your mother
and younger sister.

268
00:25:14.102 --> 00:25:16.992
Even though your father was still alive.

269
00:25:25.028 --> 00:25:27.249
It must have been hard...

270
00:25:29.192 --> 00:25:30.981
filling the empty void I left.

271
00:25:33.523 --> 00:25:37.788
That's okay. That's okay, Father.

272
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.521
Hyun, that's why...

273
00:25:48.842 --> 00:25:53.506
There's something I have to sign...

274
00:25:53.506 --> 00:25:56.212
while I'm in my right mind.

275
00:25:57.733 --> 00:25:59.161
Bring it to me.

276
00:25:59.684 --> 00:26:02.164
But...

277
00:26:02.164 --> 00:26:03.916
Let me do it.

278
00:26:07.323 --> 00:26:11.416
I can't let you make that decision too.

279
00:26:12.156 --> 00:26:13.629
Hyun.

280
00:26:46.876 --> 00:26:48.487
Were you waiting for me?

281
00:26:50.346 --> 00:26:54.657
No, I didn't have a ride back home.

282
00:27:00.145 --> 00:27:01.933
How's your father?

283
00:27:02.727 --> 00:27:05.317
He went back.

284
00:27:05.317 --> 00:27:08.243
He went to a place...

285
00:27:08.243 --> 00:27:11.125
where he can't recognize anyone.

286
00:27:14.175 --> 00:27:16.836
Is it hard to get through the day?

287
00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:19.156
There are many days
when it doesn't last five minutes.

288
00:27:23.286 --> 00:27:24.670
Shall we get going?

289
00:27:25.493 --> 00:27:28.723
Do you still want to go to Maemuldo?

290
00:27:28.723 --> 00:27:30.240
Do you want to go?

291
00:27:31.331 --> 00:27:34.367
- I'll buy you soy sauce crab.
- Why?

292
00:27:34.367 --> 00:27:37.326
Is it because my father filled
your computer with techniques?

293
00:27:37.326 --> 00:27:41.387
- No, it's because it's your birthday.
- Birthday?

294
00:27:41.387 --> 00:27:43.629
860920.

295
00:27:44.464 --> 00:27:46.829
Is that today?

296
00:27:46.829 --> 00:27:48.307
Let's go.

297
00:27:52.326 --> 00:27:56.843
Are you saying you'll celebrate
with me because it's my birthday?

298
00:28:02.077 --> 00:28:04.094
Then I want to go somewhere else.

299
00:28:31.805 --> 00:28:34.041
I didn't know a place like this existed.

300
00:28:34.041 --> 00:28:37.145
It's not all bad that you came
to the hospital ship, right?

301
00:28:37.145 --> 00:28:39.136
You don't see this in Seoul.

302
00:28:40.357 --> 00:28:42.067
You must come here often.

303
00:28:43.452 --> 00:28:47.430
I don't. It's been 20 years.

304
00:28:51.565 --> 00:28:53.481
Should we take a picture too?

305
00:28:54.464 --> 00:28:57.486
I don't really like taking pictures.

306
00:28:58.685 --> 00:29:00.058
Doctor Song.

307
00:29:03.887 --> 00:29:06.021
It's not that way. It's this way.

308
00:29:06.021 --> 00:29:09.439
Why do you always lead
when you don't know the way?

309
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.355
Let's go.

310
00:29:15.627 --> 00:29:16.994
Doctor Song.

311
00:29:22.326 --> 00:29:24.657
It turned out nice.
The background is good too.

312
00:29:35.815 --> 00:29:37.732
<i>20170920.</i>

313
00:29:37.732 --> 00:29:40.826
<i>In this moment,
I witnessed something dazzling.</i>

314
00:29:44.723 --> 00:29:46.195
Cheers.

315
00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:51.416
I don't like to drink during the day
because I get drunk easily.

316
00:29:51.416 --> 00:29:54.637
Just one glass.
Thank you for celebrating with me.

317
00:29:54.637 --> 00:29:58.725
Don't get ahead of yourself. If it's too
expensive, we're splitting the bill.

318
00:30:05.892 --> 00:30:08.958
Do you know
what the warmest peach is called?

319
00:30:08.958 --> 00:30:10.156
I don't know.
