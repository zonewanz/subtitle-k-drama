00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:18.672
- My lord. - Oh, my.

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:19.706
(Episode 9)

3
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.611
Brother.

4
00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:27.013
Ddak Sae.

5
00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:29.683
Brother.

6
00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:34.187
Brother.

7
00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:57.410
Why did you stop me?

8
00:00:58.144 --> 00:01:00.347
You should have let me die with my brother.

9
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.782
Why did you stop me there?

10
00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:06.519
Why did you...

11
00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:08.588
interfere?

12
00:01:08.888 --> 00:01:12.659
Why did you do that, you scumbag? Why?

13
00:01:18.431 --> 00:01:19.699
Why?

14
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:26.473
Why?

15
00:01:41.454 --> 00:01:43.623
Hey, you.

16
00:01:44.257 --> 00:01:45.458
Who are you?

17
00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:48.194
Who are you, scumbag?

18
00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:49.462
You...

19
00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:59.005
You should hit him hard. Can you not do that?

20
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:01.641
I have never hit anyone before.

21
00:02:02.575 --> 00:02:03.777
Let us find the key.

22
00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.305
Ddak Sae, did you meet Mother?

23
00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:35.041
Please tell Mother...

24
00:02:36.142 --> 00:02:38.511
that I am so sorry for not being...

25
00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:42.081
able to keep the promise.

26
00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:47.454
And in the other world,

27
00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:51.257
do not let others treat you like a stupid person.

28
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:53.793
Do not laugh so easily.

29
00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:57.630
I told you that could get on people's nerves.

30
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.006
Live well with Mother.

31
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.309
I will follow you soon.

32
00:03:10.343 --> 00:03:12.378
I am sorry I could not protect you.

33
00:03:13.847 --> 00:03:15.081
I am so sorry.

34
00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:18.084
I am sorry, Ddak Sae.

35
00:03:28.828 --> 00:03:31.531
I am so sorry. I am sorry, Ddak Sae.

36
00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.666
I am so sorry.

37
00:03:34.767 --> 00:03:36.169
I am sorry, Ddak Sae.

38
00:03:38.238 --> 00:03:39.339
Ddak Sae.

39
00:03:42.942 --> 00:03:44.310
Live well.

40
00:03:49.382 --> 00:03:51.150
Do you still not know?

41
00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:53.286
Your twisted conception of the world...

42
00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:56.356
is taking you to a wrong path as a doctor.

43
00:03:58.491 --> 00:03:59.726
Is my...

44
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.096
twisted conception of the world the real problem here?

45
00:04:04.397 --> 00:04:07.166
Or is it the twisted world?

46
00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:17.844
I am sorry, Ddak Sae.

47
00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:44.604
I heard that the Japanese soldiers are coming.

48
00:04:44.604 --> 00:04:46.306
You should head North.

49
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.409
And I will pay my debt...

50
00:04:50.076 --> 00:04:51.477
if we get to meet again...

51
00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:53.212
alive.

52
00:04:55.148 --> 00:04:56.249
Please take...

53
00:05:00.253 --> 00:05:01.487
Mak Gae.

54
00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:03.790
What?

55
00:05:03.957 --> 00:05:06.793
Dr. Heo, why are you not going with us?

56
00:05:06.793 --> 00:05:08.628
I have somewhere else to go.

57
00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:11.731
Then take me with you.

58
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.343
You have been through a lot while working for me.

59
00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:26.779
Wherever you go,

60
00:05:27.914 --> 00:05:29.682
do not forget to study medicine.

61
00:05:30.583 --> 00:05:32.018
Dr. Heo.

62
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.822
You can pay the debt now.

63
00:05:37.156 --> 00:05:38.157
What?

64
00:05:43.963 --> 00:05:45.198
Kill me.

65
00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:50.803
- Dr. Heo. - What are you talking about?

66
00:05:51.304 --> 00:05:53.272
Why would I kill you?

67
00:05:53.272 --> 00:05:54.674
I told you to kill me.

68
00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:41.854
Take care.

69
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.661
Wait.

70
00:06:55.902 --> 00:06:57.403
You will never...

71
00:06:57.904 --> 00:07:00.339
get to experience strange things because of me.

72
00:07:18.825 --> 00:07:19.859
What?

73
00:07:20.293 --> 00:07:23.096
What's the name of the owner of Heo Bong Tak's phone again?

74
00:07:23.096 --> 00:07:24.797
It's someone called Ma Seong Tae.

75
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:27.366
His studio apartment is under his name too.

76
00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:32.472
By the way, I can trace signals of Choi Yeon Kyung's phone again.

77
00:07:32.472 --> 00:07:33.673
Where is she?

78
00:07:39.946 --> 00:07:40.947
Yeon Kyung.

79
00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:42.949
What happened?

80
00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:48.855
Yeon Kyung. Yeon Kyung.

81
00:07:50.857 --> 00:07:53.593
How can a police not find a missing person?

82
00:07:53.593 --> 00:07:55.228
We're paying taxes for you.

83
00:07:55.228 --> 00:07:57.764
- Find her now! Now! - Calm down.

84
00:07:57.764 --> 00:07:59.766
How can I calm down?

85
00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:01.400
How can you call yourself a police?

86
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.869
- Please. - Gosh.

87
00:08:04.237 --> 00:08:05.304
Yeon Kyung.

88
00:08:05.772 --> 00:08:07.707
Mr. Choi, Yeon Kyung is here.

89
00:08:07.707 --> 00:08:09.375
- Mr. Choi. - Yeon Kyung?

90
00:08:12.378 --> 00:08:14.847
Why does she look so sick?

91
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:16.249
Are you all right?

92
00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:17.517
Are you all right?

93
00:08:17.984 --> 00:08:20.286
Yes, I just need to take a rest.

94
00:08:20.353 --> 00:08:22.321
We've been looking for you all day.

95
00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:24.056
Where have you been?

96
00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:25.958
I've been wandering about.

97
00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.794
- Where? - Don't.

98
00:08:29.996 --> 00:08:31.097
Go inside.

99
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.431
Okay.

100
00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:43.609
Mr. Choi, are you all right?

101
00:08:43.609 --> 00:08:46.279
I am fine. Leave me alone...

102
00:08:46.546 --> 00:08:50.283
and make some hot betony tea.

103
00:08:51.918 --> 00:08:53.052
Yes, Mr. Choi.

104
00:08:56.322 --> 00:08:57.423
Oh, my.

105
00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:02.128
At least, she's back.

106
00:09:02.361 --> 00:09:03.796
She's back.

107
00:09:09.969 --> 00:09:11.737
Your pulse is a little weak.

108
00:09:14.073 --> 00:09:16.075
What happened?

109
00:09:16.843 --> 00:09:20.346
Jae Ha, I'm so sorry, but I am so tired right now.

110
00:09:21.247 --> 00:09:23.015
I'm relieved to have you back.

111
00:09:23.683 --> 00:09:25.218
Don't think about anything, and sleep tight.

112
00:09:27.453 --> 00:09:30.990
(Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic)

113
00:09:39.565 --> 00:09:42.101
He has an identity tag,

114
00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:44.403
doesn't know what a phone is,

115
00:09:44.403 --> 00:09:46.105
and we can't find his fingerprints.

116
00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:48.207
You couldn't find his fingerprints?

117
00:09:48.207 --> 00:09:50.977
The fingerprints on his thumb and index fingers were worn off.

118
00:09:50.977 --> 00:09:51.978
Wait.

119
00:09:52.845 --> 00:09:54.847
I think...

120
00:09:55.748 --> 00:09:58.885
I told this to the person who took him out of prison...

121
00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:01.020
which happens to be the woman...

122
00:10:01.153 --> 00:10:02.889
you are looking for.

123
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:24.677
I am worse than dogs and pigs.

124
00:10:24.911 --> 00:10:27.346
I will die many times...

125
00:10:27.446 --> 00:10:30.082
to pacify your anger.

126
00:10:30.182 --> 00:10:33.719
But it will only dirty your hands...

127
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.456
if you kill...

128
00:10:38.858 --> 00:10:41.394
dirty and lowly lives like us.

129
00:10:43.462 --> 00:10:44.497
Please...

130
00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:47.600
show us mercy,

131
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.235
and just spare our lives.

132
00:10:49.936 --> 00:10:52.538
Please spare our lives.

133
00:10:53.539 --> 00:10:55.408
Please, My lord.

134
00:10:57.043 --> 00:11:01.047
Please spare our lives, My lord.

135
00:11:01.047 --> 00:11:03.149
My lord.

136
00:11:03.382 --> 00:11:05.651
He has been hurt many times.

137
00:11:06.585 --> 00:11:09.588
No one in this world could comfort him.

138
00:11:10.356 --> 00:11:14.593
It will be hard, but I hope that you become that guy's friend.

139
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.922
Wait a second. Shouldn't we go somewhere else...

140
00:11:42.922 --> 00:11:44.290
Don't act up.

141
00:11:44.857 --> 00:11:46.058
Let's just go home.

142
00:11:49.362 --> 00:11:51.797
What? Aren't you that guy?

143
00:11:52.031 --> 00:11:54.200
You're the guy from last time.

144
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.469
You're the young man who came with Chun Sool.

145
00:11:57.436 --> 00:12:00.606
You... Right?

146
00:12:01.941 --> 00:12:04.744
What is that? Isn't that blood?

147
00:12:05.611 --> 00:12:06.846
Is it just red or is it blood?

148
00:12:11.317 --> 00:12:14.353
Whatever the situation you're in,

149
00:12:14.353 --> 00:12:16.455
you're welcome to be here.

150
00:12:16.589 --> 00:12:19.091
He's been sick all day today.

151
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:21.360
He's going to die at this rate.

152
00:12:22.161 --> 00:12:24.263
Why did he not go to a hospital?

153
00:12:24.263 --> 00:12:27.600
He wouldn't be here if he had enough money to get checked up.

154
00:12:27.733 --> 00:12:31.871
Even if he had, they'd look down on him...

155
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:34.607
for being unclean and smelling bad.

156
00:12:34.607 --> 00:12:37.510
Still, he's lucky.

157
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.212
The doctor showed up...

158
00:12:40.212 --> 00:12:42.615
at a right timing.

159
00:12:47.787 --> 00:12:49.321
Mother...

160
00:12:53.526 --> 00:12:55.528
Please save him.

161
00:12:57.063 --> 00:12:59.432
You're safe now.

162
00:12:59.432 --> 00:13:01.367
You don't know how great his skills are.

163
00:13:01.434 --> 00:13:02.735
He's amazing.

164
00:13:05.538 --> 00:13:06.539
Well...

165
00:13:07.339 --> 00:13:09.308
Well... Goodness.

166
00:13:10.042 --> 00:13:12.445
What's wrong... Doctor.

167
00:13:13.045 --> 00:13:15.414
Where are you going? What's wrong...

168
00:14:20.646 --> 00:14:23.315
Is he crazy? This is ox bezoar.

169
00:14:23.782 --> 00:14:25.985
- Did you steal this? - No.

170
00:14:26.085 --> 00:14:28.687
I got it as my payment for a year.

171
00:14:28.687 --> 00:14:31.257
You brat. I know you stole this.

172
00:14:31.257 --> 00:14:32.691
I did not steal it.

173
00:14:32.691 --> 00:14:34.560
You little...

174
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:38.831
- Give it back. - Let go.

175
00:14:39.298 --> 00:14:40.933
I know you stole it.

176
00:14:41.133 --> 00:14:43.669
I need to save my mother with it.

177
00:14:58.017 --> 00:15:00.920
You were born as a slave, yet you became a superintendent.

178
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.355
You should be so grateful for your fortune in your life.

179
00:15:03.689 --> 00:15:06.025
You did not realize your place and desired to work in the palace.

180
00:15:06.025 --> 00:15:09.161
Did you not know that you were only like a mere dog...

181
00:15:09.161 --> 00:15:12.731
who would wag its tail for some feed?

182
00:15:14.767 --> 00:15:18.070
Then how was the world without any class?

183
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.538
Was it different from here?

184
00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:23.209
Did you think you could have what you could not have in this world?

185
00:15:28.314 --> 00:15:29.782
I shall show you...

186
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.221
just what I can have in this new world.

187
00:15:36.388 --> 00:15:37.790
I will never...

188
00:15:39.692 --> 00:15:44.196
I will never get insulted and be humiliated in my life ever again.

189
00:16:33.178 --> 00:16:34.647
You've showed up at last.

190
00:16:35.414 --> 00:16:36.982
What's wrong with your clothes?

191
00:16:38.384 --> 00:16:40.853
What happened? You were out of reach all day long.

192
00:16:40.853 --> 00:16:43.355
Did you forget that I told you to empty your morning schedule?

193
00:16:43.689 --> 00:16:45.858
Do you realize how important today's meeting was?

194
00:16:49.795 --> 00:16:51.797
Did I have to be there?

195
00:16:51.797 --> 00:16:55.234
Of course, I told you it was to treat someone important.

196
00:16:55.234 --> 00:16:57.169
If I treat that person,

197
00:16:58.904 --> 00:17:00.506
what do I gain in return?

198
00:17:03.442 --> 00:17:05.444
You do take after me.

199
00:17:05.811 --> 00:17:07.546
Now, we're on the same page.

200
00:17:07.846 --> 00:17:11.517
What do you gain in return for treating someone important?

201
00:17:11.617 --> 00:17:13.452
You gain that person.

202
00:17:14.687 --> 00:17:18.290
The money and power they have.

203
00:17:20.025 --> 00:17:21.960
Is this how this world works?

204
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.962
Is it not the same in the other world?

205
00:17:26.065 --> 00:17:29.368
They may be the same doctors, but their levels differ...

206
00:17:29.735 --> 00:17:32.204
depending on whom they treat.

207
00:17:32.338 --> 00:17:35.274
Doctors sell their medical technique anyway.

208
00:17:35.674 --> 00:17:38.344
So it's better to meet someone...

209
00:17:38.577 --> 00:17:40.879
who recognizes your ability and pays a lot for your price.

210
00:17:41.547 --> 00:17:43.782
It's better to make a profit out of it.

211
00:17:46.985 --> 00:17:49.321
What do you say? Do you want...

212
00:17:50.889 --> 00:17:53.092
to do this business with me?

213
00:18:19.852 --> 00:18:20.986
Welcome.

214
00:18:21.987 --> 00:18:24.223
Can I have today's latte?

215
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.632
What is the most delicious cake you sell here?

216
00:18:33.632 --> 00:18:35.701
It's strawberry chocolate cream cake.

217
00:18:36.101 --> 00:18:37.669
- I'll have that. - Okay.

218
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.744
It's best to have sweet cake whenever you're down.

219
00:18:46.345 --> 00:18:47.780
Here's your coffee.

220
00:18:50.015 --> 00:18:51.350
I need to go. Bye.

221
00:19:03.295 --> 00:19:05.030
Please make it a to-go. Hurry.

222
00:19:11.937 --> 00:19:13.772
Did you go home safely that day?

223
00:19:16.275 --> 00:19:18.243
Did you have breakfast?

224
00:19:22.314 --> 00:19:25.083
Do you want to have lunch with me at the cafeteria?

225
00:19:27.886 --> 00:19:29.455
You don't like cafeteria?

226
00:19:30.556 --> 00:19:34.526
Then how about a delicious meat restaurant over there?

227
00:19:38.564 --> 00:19:40.299
Let's have lunch...

228
00:19:41.867 --> 00:19:42.935
together.

229
00:19:43.769 --> 00:19:45.003
I have an appointment.

230
00:19:50.142 --> 00:19:52.911
Okay. Then let's have lunch later.

231
00:19:53.545 --> 00:19:55.214
So you like to drink coffee.

232
00:19:56.615 --> 00:20:00.018
It's amazing to have with coffee.

233
00:20:00.118 --> 00:20:03.055
Take it and share it with your colleagues.

234
00:20:04.756 --> 00:20:05.791
No, thanks.

235
00:20:25.043 --> 00:20:28.814
Yeong Kyung, are you okay? Are you hurt?

236
00:20:28.814 --> 00:20:30.249
What happened?

237
00:20:30.249 --> 00:20:32.451
I'm glad that you look fine.

238
00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:34.786
Yes, I'm back safely.

239
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.522
I'll explain later.

240
00:20:36.622 --> 00:20:40.692
I'm being so miserable like this when I'm an assistant doctor.

241
00:20:41.727 --> 00:20:43.862
What? Yeon Kyung.

242
00:20:44.763 --> 00:20:46.865
What happened? Are you okay?

243
00:20:46.865 --> 00:20:48.300
Don't tell me you were worried about me.

244
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.703
Do you know how much I suffered to take care of your patients too?

245
00:20:51.703 --> 00:20:55.474
I had to stay up all night too. Look at my dark circles.

246
00:20:55.474 --> 00:20:57.342
They're down to your chin.

247
00:20:57.342 --> 00:20:59.545
He realized the importance of his colleague.

248
00:20:59.645 --> 00:21:03.348
I'm so busy that I'm having cup noodles with a tuna can.

249
00:21:03.715 --> 00:21:07.753
You... Goodness. What is this? It's cake.

250
00:21:12.257 --> 00:21:14.893
This must be your office.

251
00:21:16.194 --> 00:21:18.230
I don't have an office of my own.

252
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.001
What are you doing?

253
00:21:23.569 --> 00:21:26.171
You haven't tried this since I made it for you then, right?

254
00:21:27.072 --> 00:21:29.374
Tuna ramyeon is the best.

255
00:21:36.515 --> 00:21:37.883
Where can I get water here?

256
00:21:37.883 --> 00:21:40.552
This is a doctor's office.

257
00:21:40.552 --> 00:21:41.753
Right.

258
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:46.024
There's a lounge in front of it. Let's eat there together.

259
00:21:50.329 --> 00:21:52.764
Can't you see what I am doing?

260
00:21:56.702 --> 00:21:59.104
I have a lot of people who care for me,

261
00:22:00.205 --> 00:22:02.874
but you don't have anyone here...

262
00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:05.243
but me.

263
00:22:05.877 --> 00:22:07.579
That's why I'm going to take care of you.

264
00:22:13.552 --> 00:22:14.786
You do not need to.

265
00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.990
I do not want to eat it. You should have it by yourself.

266
00:22:29.134 --> 00:22:30.969
This must not be the right method.

267
00:22:49.287 --> 00:22:51.890
You were absent without notice and leaving without notice.

268
00:22:52.624 --> 00:22:54.259
It looks like you're doing everything as you please.

269
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.396
I have talked about this with the director.

270
00:22:57.396 --> 00:22:58.463
I know.

271
00:22:59.131 --> 00:23:02.401
I see you have a reliable sponsor.

272
00:23:04.836 --> 00:23:06.371
If you have a problem,

273
00:23:06.371 --> 00:23:08.240
you should ask him yourself...

274
00:23:09.274 --> 00:23:10.575
to kick me out.

275
00:23:12.377 --> 00:23:14.780
Why would I do that?

276
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.848
I know a better way.

277
00:23:16.848 --> 00:23:18.583
If you are done talking, I would like to leave.

278
00:23:18.583 --> 00:23:19.851
I have a business to attend to.

279
00:23:20.052 --> 00:23:22.020
What happened yesterday with Choi Yeon Kyung?

280
00:23:34.599 --> 00:23:36.034
Dr. Yoo,

281
00:23:37.169 --> 00:23:39.638
do you have the time to interfere with others' lives?

282
00:23:39.638 --> 00:23:41.339
If you had made a mistake like that,

283
00:23:41.339 --> 00:23:43.575
you should either study or repent.

284
00:23:45.944 --> 00:23:47.179
Choi Yeon Kyung...

285
00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:49.247
is not like others to me.

286
00:23:49.981 --> 00:23:51.316
If anyone hurts her,

287
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.318
I will not forgive them.

288
00:23:53.518 --> 00:23:55.887
I will never get involved with her.

289
00:23:56.388 --> 00:23:57.789
So do not worry,

290
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.092
and tend to your patients.

291
00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:26.151
Now,

292
00:24:27.486 --> 00:24:29.454
we are on our separate ways.

293
00:24:41.099 --> 00:24:42.300
Yes, Jae Ha?

294
00:24:46.037 --> 00:24:47.873
You know I don't take herbal medicine.

295
00:24:47.873 --> 00:24:50.275
I know. That's why I got some porridge for you.

296
00:24:50.275 --> 00:24:51.276
Porridge?

297
00:24:53.044 --> 00:24:54.079
You made it?

298
00:24:55.847 --> 00:25:00.519
Well, I didn't say I made it.

299
00:25:01.319 --> 00:25:02.854
I knew it.

300
00:25:02.854 --> 00:25:04.256
It's a lotus porridge.

301
00:25:04.256 --> 00:25:05.824
It's made out of lotus seeds.

302
00:25:05.824 --> 00:25:08.393
I heard it's good for venting out the frustration inside of you.

303
00:25:08.393 --> 00:25:09.628
You should try it.

304
00:25:10.095 --> 00:25:11.830
Frustration?

305
00:25:13.932 --> 00:25:15.634
Who said I was frustrated?

306
00:25:15.634 --> 00:25:17.002
To me,

307
00:25:17.102 --> 00:25:18.937
you look like you are.

308
00:25:20.005 --> 00:25:22.374
You are indeed an oriental doctor.

309
00:25:22.941 --> 00:25:24.109
You're all grown up now.

310
00:25:24.276 --> 00:25:25.944
You can take care of people too.

311
00:25:27.913 --> 00:25:28.980
Did you know...

312
00:25:29.981 --> 00:25:31.683
that I became an oriental doctor because of you?

313
00:25:32.117 --> 00:25:33.118
What?

314
00:25:33.952 --> 00:25:35.287
When I was young,

315
00:25:36.254 --> 00:25:37.823
after my dad died like that,

316
00:25:37.889 --> 00:25:40.091
I was always timid because of my grandfather.

317
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.862
But one day, when I went to your house with my grandfather,

318
00:25:44.429 --> 00:25:45.764
the day I saw you for the first time,

319
00:25:46.898 --> 00:25:48.466
you held a needle in your hand and said,

320
00:25:48.733 --> 00:25:51.069
"This is a needle for acupuncture."

321
00:25:52.871 --> 00:25:56.541
"I will become a great doctor of oriental medicine when I grow up."

322
00:25:56.675 --> 00:25:59.411
Your eyes were sparkling so much.

323
00:25:59.711 --> 00:26:01.179
I made up my mind then...

324
00:26:01.513 --> 00:26:02.814
that I would become a doctor of oriental medicine as well.

325
00:26:03.748 --> 00:26:06.718
I wanted to have the same dream as you,

326
00:26:07.519 --> 00:26:09.020
not because my grandfather wanted me to,

327
00:26:10.188 --> 00:26:11.389
but because I wanted to.

328
00:26:15.627 --> 00:26:17.028
I grew up so well...

329
00:26:17.028 --> 00:26:19.231
thanks to you.

330
00:26:19.497 --> 00:26:21.666
So you should make use of me.

331
00:26:21.666 --> 00:26:23.635
If you're having a hard time, you can talk to me...

332
00:26:23.802 --> 00:26:25.270
and lean on me.

333
00:26:26.204 --> 00:26:28.974
Why are you so serious today?

334
00:26:29.074 --> 00:26:30.075
Okay.

335
00:26:30.475 --> 00:26:32.744
Let me see.

336
00:26:33.945 --> 00:26:35.113
Lotus porridge?

337
00:26:53.665 --> 00:26:57.435
People who have earned a lot of money by doing business...

338
00:26:57.435 --> 00:26:59.204
are called "jaebol" here.

339
00:26:59.204 --> 00:27:01.039
For you, it would be...

340
00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:02.707
the equivalent of wealthy merchants.

341
00:27:04.242 --> 00:27:05.410
Chief Secretary Cho...

342
00:27:05.844 --> 00:27:07.679
works at the Blue House.

343
00:27:08.046 --> 00:27:10.582
It's like serving the king at the palace in Joseon.

344
00:27:10.715 --> 00:27:14.452
He's the equivalent of a minister or an official at the palace.

345
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.288
Welcome.

346
00:27:16.354 --> 00:27:18.056
Sorry for being late.

347
00:27:18.056 --> 00:27:19.457
It's nothing.

348
00:27:19.457 --> 00:27:21.960
You went through trouble twice because of us.

349
00:27:23.762 --> 00:27:27.332
Dr. Heo Bong Tak, I owe my life to you,

350
00:27:27.332 --> 00:27:29.567
so I'm giving you another chance.

351
00:27:29.567 --> 00:27:32.103
I will do my best not to let you down.

352
00:27:32.938 --> 00:27:34.072
Please come this way.

353
00:27:44.849 --> 00:27:46.551
Chairman.

354
00:27:47.252 --> 00:27:48.753
Hello.

355
00:27:50.722 --> 00:27:52.891
This is Dr. Heo Bong Tak...

356
00:27:52.891 --> 00:27:54.659
that I had mentioned.

357
00:27:54.659 --> 00:27:56.494
He's younger than I thought.

358
00:27:56.594 --> 00:27:59.764
I did accept this offer because you recommended it,

359
00:27:59.764 --> 00:28:02.901
but does acupuncture actually treat anything?

360
00:28:07.072 --> 00:28:09.674
Dr. Heo, why are you doing this?

361
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.979
I cannot treat a patient...

362
00:28:14.179 --> 00:28:15.981
if he does not believe me.

363
00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:17.615
This is not what you promised.

364
00:28:19.517 --> 00:28:20.919
I think that...

365
00:28:21.619 --> 00:28:23.321
although I am here for your son,

366
00:28:24.622 --> 00:28:27.292
I need to treat your migraine first.

367
00:28:27.292 --> 00:28:29.594
What? How did you know that?

368
00:28:29.594 --> 00:28:31.663
Your ears are red.

369
00:28:33.431 --> 00:28:36.267
When you touch something hot, you touch your ears...

370
00:28:36.368 --> 00:28:38.903
because they are the coldest parts in our body.

371
00:28:38.903 --> 00:28:40.839
But your ears are red.

372
00:28:40.939 --> 00:28:43.441
That means the gall bladder meridian in charge of your ears are heated.

373
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:46.244
The Qi around that place has been stopped,

374
00:28:46.344 --> 00:28:48.380
which is why you have a lot of headaches.

375
00:28:49.514 --> 00:28:51.316
If you have a doctor you trust,

376
00:28:51.616 --> 00:28:53.618
you should call that doctor. Goodbye.

377
00:28:54.085 --> 00:28:56.454
Why do you think I became like this?

378
00:28:57.622 --> 00:29:00.859
There are so many rumors about my son in the papers.

379
00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:03.528
I need you to fix him before the anniversary ceremony...

380
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:05.130
which will be held next month.

381
00:29:18.443 --> 00:29:19.978
This means...

382
00:29:19.978 --> 00:29:22.781
you can never tell anyone about what you saw and heard here.

383
00:29:46.204 --> 00:29:47.439
His eyes look dull.

384
00:29:47.872 --> 00:29:50.775
He has a dark patch under his eyes, and his breathes irregularly.

385
00:29:51.142 --> 00:29:53.445
His skin is rough, his lips dry,

386
00:29:54.579 --> 00:29:56.347
and there are cracks in his finger nails.

387
00:30:14.499 --> 00:30:16.067
His pulses are weak,

388
00:30:16.367 --> 00:30:18.169
and his eyes have faint colors.

389
00:30:19.804 --> 00:30:21.039
He is addicted to opium.

390
00:30:21.306 --> 00:30:23.708
I sent him to study abroad and spent so much money,

391
00:30:23.708 --> 00:30:25.577
and yet he's been doing drugs?

392
00:30:25.577 --> 00:30:29.047
He's never done anything to disappoint us.

393
00:30:29.047 --> 00:30:30.048
Of course.

394
00:30:32.383 --> 00:30:35.253
We can't have surgery or give him medicine to treat him.

395
00:30:35.253 --> 00:30:38.590
- I've tried sending him to a rehab. - Yes.

396
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.926
But there's no use. He does drugs again when he comes out.

397
00:30:41.926 --> 00:30:43.461
Doctors who come here...

398
00:30:43.461 --> 00:30:45.663
try to treat him by making conversations with him.

399
00:30:45.864 --> 00:30:47.699
I don't feel good...

400
00:30:47.699 --> 00:30:49.701
keeping him locked up here like this.

401
00:30:49.701 --> 00:30:50.702
Yes.

402
00:30:50.969 --> 00:30:52.904
He feels empty...

403
00:30:53.404 --> 00:30:55.673
and lacks life force.

404
00:30:55.673 --> 00:30:57.108
What? He feels empty?

405
00:30:57.108 --> 00:30:58.743
Why would he?

406
00:30:58.743 --> 00:31:01.379
I've brought him up so that he can have...

407
00:31:01.379 --> 00:31:02.847
- everything he needs. - I will help him open his mind...

408
00:31:02.847 --> 00:31:04.582
and instill energy in him.

409
00:31:04.582 --> 00:31:07.152
With what? You're going to open what?

410
00:32:23.595 --> 00:32:26.030
He's very competent.

411
00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.065
Right.

412
00:32:27.432 --> 00:32:30.335
Where did you find someone like him?

413
00:32:30.335 --> 00:32:34.606
I was lucky to find such a competent man at the right timing.

414
00:32:35.173 --> 00:32:37.642
I heard from the chief secretary...

415
00:32:37.775 --> 00:32:39.611
that you're starting up...

416
00:32:39.611 --> 00:32:42.814
a big business in Gyeongin-si.

417
00:32:45.283 --> 00:32:50.021
I'm sure you were talking about money...

418
00:32:50.321 --> 00:32:53.358
when you asked for my help.

419
00:33:02.233 --> 00:33:03.534
Let me...

420
00:33:04.569 --> 00:33:05.970
get out of here.

421
00:33:08.106 --> 00:33:09.340
Please.

422
00:33:11.943 --> 00:33:13.778
Help me get out of here.

423
00:33:16.814 --> 00:33:18.750
I am only a doctor who treats illnesses.

424
00:33:23.855 --> 00:33:25.657
I need to meet someone.

425
00:33:26.557 --> 00:33:28.192
I must meet her.

426
00:33:28.493 --> 00:33:30.428
Please help me. Please.

427
00:33:33.031 --> 00:33:34.198
I'll pay you.

428
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.869
I'll give you money!

429
00:34:06.597 --> 00:34:07.999
I'll be right there.

430
00:34:09.967 --> 00:34:11.235
Wait a little more.

431
00:34:11.936 --> 00:34:15.373
Gosh, thank you for your hard work.

432
00:34:16.974 --> 00:34:20.478
I'll compensate you enough.

433
00:34:20.611 --> 00:34:24.649
I'm willing to do everything if you can treat him.

434
00:34:26.617 --> 00:34:30.221
I thank you in advance.

435
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.436
- Are you waiting for someone? - No.

436
00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:49.374
Nurse Jung.

437
00:34:50.775 --> 00:34:53.678
What do you do when your friend is going through a hard time?

438
00:34:53.678 --> 00:34:55.012
Nothing special.

439
00:34:56.013 --> 00:35:00.284
I stay beside them, wait for them, and trust them.

440
00:35:01.219 --> 00:35:02.387
Right?

441
00:35:04.322 --> 00:35:06.157
It's so easy when you say it.

442
00:35:18.136 --> 00:35:20.872
Your friend is here. I'll see you later.

443
00:35:45.096 --> 00:35:48.232
You said you had an appointment. Did you go somewhere with the director?

444
00:35:48.933 --> 00:35:51.369
- We went for a treatment. - To outside?

445
00:35:52.837 --> 00:35:55.273
What kind of patient are they that you went outside for a treatment?

446
00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:02.947
Gosh, look who's here.

447
00:36:03.214 --> 00:36:04.916
Mr. Heo Bong Tak.

448
00:36:06.851 --> 00:36:09.220
How is it to work under Director Ma?

449
00:36:09.554 --> 00:36:11.789
- Is it bearable? - Yes.

450
00:36:11.789 --> 00:36:13.524
I knew Dr. Heo was good at...

451
00:36:13.524 --> 00:36:17.228
giving acupuncture but I didn't know he was good at aligning with power.

452
00:36:17.228 --> 00:36:20.097
You'd only be a salaryman.

453
00:36:20.097 --> 00:36:21.933
Don't be so loyal.

454
00:36:21.933 --> 00:36:24.569
Some people are just born to be rich.

455
00:36:25.203 --> 00:36:29.073
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

456
00:36:29.273 --> 00:36:33.311
but I think you're talking a little rudely to him.

457
00:36:33.311 --> 00:36:34.512
What?

458
00:36:35.179 --> 00:36:37.882
- What did you say? - Yeon Kyung.

459
00:36:37.882 --> 00:36:39.517
What I meant is...

460
00:36:41.085 --> 00:36:44.288
He doesn't work in our hospital.

461
00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:47.024
He works at Shinhae Oriental Medicine Hospital after all.

462
00:37:06.644 --> 00:37:07.912
Stop there.

463
00:37:18.523 --> 00:37:20.091
So you know me now?

464
00:37:21.859 --> 00:37:24.629
So do you pity on me?

465
00:37:26.631 --> 00:37:28.466
Do I look like a child...

466
00:37:28.933 --> 00:37:31.002
who becomes all happy for a few candies?

467
00:37:35.306 --> 00:37:37.775
Stop acting so generous.

468
00:37:40.177 --> 00:37:41.345
You're right.

469
00:37:44.015 --> 00:37:45.316
I know all about you.

470
00:37:49.787 --> 00:37:52.523
I know what class you were in Joseon Dynasty.

471
00:37:55.226 --> 00:37:58.262
I know what you did in front of...

472
00:38:00.898 --> 00:38:02.466
that darn Minister of War.

473
00:38:07.738 --> 00:38:09.040
I saw it all.

474
00:38:10.741 --> 00:38:14.211
Are you ashamed of it? Does my finding out about it...

475
00:38:15.713 --> 00:38:17.415
hurt your pride so much?

476
00:38:19.617 --> 00:38:21.419
It's nothing anyway.

477
00:38:23.087 --> 00:38:25.089
I don't care about any of that.

478
00:38:27.725 --> 00:38:29.760
Because I know you well now.

479
00:38:33.064 --> 00:38:34.231
Because now,

480
00:38:36.634 --> 00:38:38.836
I know all about you.

481
00:38:43.941 --> 00:38:46.944
I know how great of a doctor you are.

482
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.582
I know why you had to suffer so much.

483
00:38:52.883 --> 00:38:55.019
I know why you had to live...

484
00:38:57.388 --> 00:38:58.623
that way.

485
00:39:07.531 --> 00:39:08.933
You should not have...

486
00:39:10.534 --> 00:39:14.639
heard or seen anything about me.

487
00:39:16.907 --> 00:39:18.075
Then I would have...

488
00:39:21.679 --> 00:39:22.713
No.

489
00:39:23.447 --> 00:39:26.217
I do not care how you think about me anymore.

490
00:39:27.084 --> 00:39:29.120
So do not get in my way...

491
00:39:29.887 --> 00:39:31.255
or mind my business.

492
00:39:32.023 --> 00:39:33.124
No.

493
00:39:34.659 --> 00:39:36.994
- I can't do that. - Look, Ms. Choi.

494
00:39:36.994 --> 00:39:38.929
I have the right to do so.

495
00:39:41.065 --> 00:39:42.667
Whether it was a coincidence or fate,

496
00:39:45.002 --> 00:39:48.572
you and I happened to come across each other.

497
00:39:51.008 --> 00:39:55.079
I'm now part of your strange destiny.

498
00:39:58.149 --> 00:39:59.216
I am.

499
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.365
So...

500
00:40:17.301 --> 00:40:18.569
don't avoid me.

501
00:40:21.005 --> 00:40:22.440
Don't run away from me.

502
00:40:24.975 --> 00:40:26.711
Whatever you do.

503
00:41:47.958 --> 00:41:50.694
Are you okay?

504
00:41:50.694 --> 00:41:53.898
Where did you go? You disappeared right in front of our eyes.

505
00:41:54.331 --> 00:41:55.432
Thanks to you,

506
00:41:56.433 --> 00:41:58.803
I've been through an intense experience.

507
00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:01.438
Go out, and wait.

508
00:42:01.672 --> 00:42:02.740
- Yes, boss. - Yes, boss.

509
00:42:02.873 --> 00:42:03.874
Let's go.

510
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.747
How dare they harass a frail woman. This is embarrassing.

511
00:42:10.815 --> 00:42:13.050
I'm not a frail woman. I'm a doctor.

512
00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:14.451
I'm okay.

513
00:42:15.452 --> 00:42:18.389
Since I've become a doctor, I've been through worse.

514
00:42:18.389 --> 00:42:19.423
Through worse?

515
00:42:24.628 --> 00:42:26.997
When I couldn't save people who I wanted to,

516
00:42:27.731 --> 00:42:30.034
when I had to save people who I didn't want to,

517
00:42:32.937 --> 00:42:35.039
and when my efforts didn't...

518
00:42:39.276 --> 00:42:41.145
What's worse is...

519
00:42:43.147 --> 00:42:44.582
that I still have to treat people like you...

520
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.786
after what I've been through.

521
00:43:00.998 --> 00:43:03.868
I do not care how you think of me.

522
00:43:04.602 --> 00:43:06.737
So do not interfere with my matters,

523
00:43:07.438 --> 00:43:08.706
and do not care about them.

524
00:43:11.642 --> 00:43:12.877
I won't let him do that.

525
00:43:25.623 --> 00:43:27.825
Is she allowed to walk like that already?

526
00:43:28.025 --> 00:43:29.593
Her progress must be good.

527
00:43:30.027 --> 00:43:32.229
Of course, I performed surgery on her.

528
00:43:32.463 --> 00:43:33.597
Her progress is good.

529
00:43:34.164 --> 00:43:35.432
It's good, but...

530
00:43:37.434 --> 00:43:38.535
Let go.

531
00:43:39.536 --> 00:43:41.872
Are you pitying me?

532
00:43:42.473 --> 00:43:43.607
What's wrong?

533
00:43:43.607 --> 00:43:46.443
He's been like that ever since he found out that he became disabled.

534
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:48.512
It must hurt his pride to realize...

535
00:43:48.512 --> 00:43:50.247
- that he's disabled. - What?

536
00:43:52.182 --> 00:43:53.918
Is his pride that important?

537
00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.189
He's alive because his wife took emergency measures quickly.

538
00:43:59.189 --> 00:44:01.191
Can't he live with one uncomfortable leg?

539
00:44:01.191 --> 00:44:03.260
Why doesn't he understand how worried his wife is?

540
00:44:04.828 --> 00:44:07.398
Why can't men understand women?

541
00:44:07.398 --> 00:44:09.433
Why?

542
00:44:09.433 --> 00:44:12.102
What's wrong with you today?

543
00:44:12.102 --> 00:44:13.671
You're not okay. Let's take some medicine.

544
00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:14.772
Let's go in and take some medicine.

545
00:44:14.772 --> 00:44:16.407
My doll.

546
00:44:16.407 --> 00:44:19.009
Dad, my doll fell down.

547
00:44:19.009 --> 00:44:20.077
Okay.

548
00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:22.947
Dad, my doll fell down.

549
00:44:24.481 --> 00:44:25.582
Wait.

550
00:44:26.917 --> 00:44:28.452
I'll help you.

551
00:44:30.054 --> 00:44:31.889
- Honey. - My goodness.

552
00:44:33.457 --> 00:44:34.491
- Dad. - Goodness.

553
00:44:35.559 --> 00:44:37.528
- Oh, my. - Let me see.

554
00:44:37.528 --> 00:44:38.662
Dad.

555
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.265
- Dad. - Oh, my.

556
00:44:57.881 --> 00:44:59.049
Dad.

557
00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.118
- Look at me. - Dad.

558
00:45:01.118 --> 00:45:02.252
Are you okay?

559
00:45:02.252 --> 00:45:04.154
- Honey, no. - Dad.

560
00:45:04.154 --> 00:45:05.889
- Please wake up. - Look at me.

561
00:45:05.889 --> 00:45:06.991
No.

562
00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:30.247
Grandma, Bong Tak won't come here again.

563
00:45:30.247 --> 00:45:34.585
My son wouldn't abandon me.

564
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:36.553
Where did you hide him?

565
00:45:36.553 --> 00:45:37.955
Bring him to me.

566
00:45:38.222 --> 00:45:39.790
Bring him.

567
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:43.961
We didn't hide him. He left us.

568
00:45:46.263 --> 00:45:50.601
Bong Tak's too busy to come today.

569
00:45:50.601 --> 00:45:52.236
He will come later.

570
00:45:52.236 --> 00:45:54.772
My back...

571
00:45:54.772 --> 00:45:56.373
and knees hurt.

572
00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.844
Bong Tak has to put acupuncture on me.

573
00:46:06.316 --> 00:46:09.520
The director will treat you.

574
00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.622
Let's go in and get some acupuncture.

575
00:46:11.622 --> 00:46:12.956
I can't.

576
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:16.427
My son has to do it.

577
00:46:16.493 --> 00:46:19.730
- I can't. - You're hurting. Let's go.

578
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:22.566
Bring me Bong Tak.

579
00:46:22.566 --> 00:46:25.569
- Did you come? - Bong Tak has to do it.

580
00:46:25.569 --> 00:46:29.073
- She does that every day. - Bong Tak, where are you?

581
00:46:29.073 --> 00:46:32.609
He shouldn't have been so nice if he was going to leave like that.

582
00:46:32.743 --> 00:46:34.878
She's so lonely.

583
00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.383
We can't make him come by force.

584
00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:47.958
I can't believe him.

585
00:46:48.225 --> 00:46:50.561
She has lost so much weight from worrying about him.

586
00:46:50.561 --> 00:46:53.163
There's not a word from him.

587
00:46:53.697 --> 00:46:55.199
Oh, you're here.

588
00:46:55.466 --> 00:46:57.901
How are you? Are you okay?

589
00:46:58.902 --> 00:47:01.338
I told you to take a few days off. You don't listen to me.

590
00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:02.840
Sit down.

591
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.210
I added some milkvetch and made some yeonpo tang.

592
00:47:06.944 --> 00:47:09.847
- I have something to ask. - Ask what?

593
00:47:09.847 --> 00:47:11.515
Was I there...

594
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:15.052
on the day of dad's accident?

595
00:47:15.052 --> 00:47:17.121
What are you saying all of a sudden?

596
00:47:17.121 --> 00:47:18.889
That's absurd.

597
00:47:19.056 --> 00:47:20.724
Grandpa, answer me.

598
00:47:24.628 --> 00:47:25.963
You were...

599
00:47:26.497 --> 00:47:29.133
sleeping at home with your mom.

600
00:47:29.466 --> 00:47:31.034
You didn't even know about the accident.

601
00:47:36.073 --> 00:47:37.608
That's what I thought too.

602
00:47:40.344 --> 00:47:41.879
Aren't you going to tell me?

603
00:47:46.717 --> 00:47:48.018
If you don't,

604
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.555
I'll have to find out for myself.

605
00:47:57.161 --> 00:48:00.197
How does she know that?

606
00:48:04.868 --> 00:48:07.971
Is she remembering it now?

607
00:48:09.139 --> 00:48:11.575
That can't happen.

608
00:48:41.305 --> 00:48:42.773
Do you know...

609
00:48:45.709 --> 00:48:47.678
what happened to dad and me...

610
00:48:48.579 --> 00:48:50.581
on that day?

611
00:49:00.891 --> 00:49:02.926
We're going to Chairman Yang's house.

612
00:49:02.926 --> 00:49:05.529
His youngest daughter-in-law, who just got married,

613
00:49:06.163 --> 00:49:08.599
suddenly can't hear.

614
00:49:08.599 --> 00:49:10.767
There are a lot of doctors here,

615
00:49:10.767 --> 00:49:12.669
and the technology is advanced.

616
00:49:12.669 --> 00:49:14.838
Why are you assigning me to such personal treatments?

617
00:49:14.838 --> 00:49:16.506
Back then and now, there are people...

618
00:49:16.506 --> 00:49:20.611
who can't afford to let other people know about their illness.

619
00:49:20.711 --> 00:49:22.679
They have money and power.

620
00:49:22.679 --> 00:49:24.114
It's human nature...

621
00:49:24.114 --> 00:49:26.216
that they want to hide what they can...

622
00:49:26.216 --> 00:49:27.684
and also enjoy what they can in life.

623
00:49:29.987 --> 00:49:32.256
Nothing has changed.

624
00:49:35.459 --> 00:49:36.860
Can you hear me?

625
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:41.665
We checked everything before they got married.

626
00:49:41.765 --> 00:49:44.234
Why is she like that now?

627
00:49:44.401 --> 00:49:48.905
We shouldn't have let someone like her in the house in the first place.

628
00:49:48.972 --> 00:49:52.476
She's not in the same class as us, from her family to her education.

629
00:49:52.476 --> 00:49:54.344
What a disgrace.

630
00:49:54.344 --> 00:49:56.280
How can she be deaf already?

631
00:49:56.413 --> 00:49:58.515
Can you do something about it?

632
00:49:58.515 --> 00:50:00.884
The ear follows the mind.

633
00:50:00.884 --> 00:50:02.986
If you do not want to hear something with your ears,

634
00:50:02.986 --> 00:50:04.955
blood flows to the ears.

635
00:50:04.955 --> 00:50:06.723
That sound repeated,

636
00:50:06.723 --> 00:50:09.860
and too much blood in her ears caused the decreased nerve function.

637
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.628
It resulted in her hearing loss.

638
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:34.685
I can't believe this.

639
00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:37.821
Why did someone like her have to be in our family?

640
00:50:38.255 --> 00:50:41.091
If she was a thing, I would go make a refund.

641
00:50:42.859 --> 00:50:45.395
Gosh, what is she doing?

642
00:50:45.896 --> 00:50:48.031
I guess she can hear now.

643
00:50:54.705 --> 00:50:58.842
I'm the Minister of Education, but my son is crazy in games.

644
00:50:58.842 --> 00:51:01.878
It'll be a huge damage in my reputation if people find this out.

645
00:51:02.379 --> 00:51:06.316
I can't shake hands with people because my hands are so wet.

646
00:51:06.316 --> 00:51:10.287
My election is coming up next year, but I can't shake hands.

647
00:51:10.954 --> 00:51:13.957
He played computer games for all three days and nights.

648
00:51:14.691 --> 00:51:16.460
It caused him to be a quadriplegic.

649
00:51:18.762 --> 00:51:21.098
He's a governor who's suffering from excessive sweating.

650
00:51:25.702 --> 00:51:28.071
I owe you a huge debt.

651
00:51:28.071 --> 00:51:30.307
Call me whenever you need my help.

652
00:51:30.307 --> 00:51:32.242
I'll pay you back for certain.

653
00:51:32.242 --> 00:51:34.111
I'll do my best to help you.

654
00:51:34.211 --> 00:51:35.212
(Yoon Duk Min)

655
00:51:36.012 --> 00:51:38.782
Chairman Park sent you a car.

656
00:51:39.015 --> 00:51:41.385
I guess you need to get a license first.

657
00:52:33.503 --> 00:52:34.805
We're here.

658
00:52:35.138 --> 00:52:36.440
We're here.

659
00:52:36.706 --> 00:52:38.875
- Hey! - Over here.

660
00:52:41.878 --> 00:52:42.946
Hello.

661
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.115
It must've been hard to escort her all the way to here.

662
00:52:45.115 --> 00:52:48.618
It was hard to stop her because she insisted she'd take Bong Sik too.

663
00:52:49.352 --> 00:52:51.822
- Where is his workplace? - Over there.

664
00:52:51.822 --> 00:52:53.690
- There? - Goodness.

665
00:52:54.157 --> 00:52:55.759
It's huge.

666
00:52:55.759 --> 00:52:59.296
- Bong Tak is over there? - Yes.

667
00:52:59.296 --> 00:53:03.567
Yeon Kyung will let us meet Bong Tak. Isn't it exciting?

668
00:53:03.567 --> 00:53:06.837
Let's hurry and go there.

669
00:53:13.777 --> 00:53:16.513
Gosh, Dr. Choi. What brings you here?

670
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.114
Who is she?

671
00:53:18.114 --> 00:53:20.150
- By any chance... - Bong Tak!

672
00:53:21.918 --> 00:53:23.019
Goodness.

673
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:26.857
Gosh.

674
00:53:26.857 --> 00:53:28.525
It's really him?

675
00:53:29.092 --> 00:53:32.295
My goodness. He's changed so much.

676
00:53:33.463 --> 00:53:35.632
But she recognized him right away.

677
00:53:35.632 --> 00:53:38.869
Why didn't you come to see me?

678
00:53:38.869 --> 00:53:41.771
I waited for you every day.

679
00:53:42.572 --> 00:53:46.510
Your younger brother misses you too.

680
00:53:46.977 --> 00:53:50.413
Gosh, my Bong Tak.

681
00:53:50.413 --> 00:53:53.850
You don't look well at all.

682
00:53:55.151 --> 00:53:56.386
Goodness.

683
00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:00.490
Take this and buy delicious food.

684
00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:03.293
Eat well, and cheer up.

685
00:54:03.293 --> 00:54:06.263
- What are you doing this to me? - Goodness.

686
00:54:06.263 --> 00:54:09.466
- Let me do it. - Goodness.

687
00:54:09.666 --> 00:54:13.136
Gosh, my money.

688
00:54:15.005 --> 00:54:16.706
Leave it. I'll do it.

689
00:54:20.243 --> 00:54:22.412
My money. Goodness.

690
00:54:24.514 --> 00:54:27.183
You shouldn't visit me...

691
00:54:28.285 --> 00:54:29.719
without any notice like this.

692
00:54:30.186 --> 00:54:32.889
What did you just say?

693
00:54:36.359 --> 00:54:38.662
I told her to bring her here.

694
00:54:39.529 --> 00:54:42.065
She felt sore here and there.

695
00:54:42.198 --> 00:54:44.901
And she wanted her son to give her acupuncture.

696
00:54:45.602 --> 00:54:49.306
I thought you'd be glad to see her.

697
00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:51.975
I need to head out.

698
00:54:53.009 --> 00:54:56.913
Get a treatment from another doctor here and leave.

699
00:55:02.852 --> 00:55:04.254
Bong Tak.

700
00:55:04.754 --> 00:55:07.357
What was that? Is he really the same person from before?

701
00:55:08.024 --> 00:55:09.626
He's completely different now.

702
00:55:09.726 --> 00:55:12.862
Gosh, Bong Tak.

703
00:55:13.063 --> 00:55:15.398
He looks worn out.

704
00:55:16.766 --> 00:55:21.237
Make sure you give these to him so that he buys good food with them.

705
00:55:22.105 --> 00:55:23.707
I'm sorry, ma'am.

706
00:55:23.974 --> 00:55:25.241
It's okay.

707
00:55:30.513 --> 00:55:33.383
You look upset. Did something happen?

708
00:55:35.185 --> 00:55:36.319
No.

709
00:55:45.261 --> 00:55:46.463
Let's go.

710
00:56:16.292 --> 00:56:17.761
Goodbye, ma'am.

711
00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.748
Please give me some water.

712
00:56:39.883 --> 00:56:41.951
I'm so thirsty.

713
00:57:04.441 --> 00:57:06.509
I'll read your pulse.

714
00:57:10.246 --> 00:57:11.347
Your meridians...

715
00:57:40.009 --> 00:57:44.013
Hi. Did you and her arrive home safely?

716
00:57:44.314 --> 00:57:47.016
Please remind her to get acupuncture from my grandpa.

717
00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:49.753
This is an emergency patient. Move out of the way.

718
00:57:55.592 --> 00:57:56.860
1, 2, 3.

719
00:57:58.094 --> 00:57:59.195
Sir.

720
00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:01.297
What's his condition?

721
00:58:01.898 --> 00:58:05.335
We don't know the cause, but he's out of breath and has a high fever.

722
00:58:06.002 --> 00:58:09.806
His blood pressure is 90 over 70, and the pulse rate is 95.

723
00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.176
Sir, since when were you out of breath?

724
00:58:13.176 --> 00:58:14.611
I don't know.

725
00:58:15.145 --> 00:58:17.680
It happened suddenly.

726
00:58:19.182 --> 00:58:21.451
I can't hear his heart beats clearly. Prepare for sonogram.

727
00:58:21.651 --> 00:58:22.886
Yes, sir.

728
00:58:22.886 --> 00:58:26.890
Are you crazy? How could you let him go to the hospital?

729
00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:30.059
What will you do if he gets caught for taking drugs?

730
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.694
I won't let that happen.

731
00:58:31.795 --> 00:58:33.930
If something happens to my son,

732
00:58:34.063 --> 00:58:37.634
I won't end this with simply making you resign.

733
00:58:37.734 --> 00:58:39.836
Do you understand me?

734
00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:22.212
Who is that patient?

735
00:59:22.579 --> 00:59:24.414
How are you related?

736
00:59:24.714 --> 00:59:26.015
How is the patient?

737
00:59:26.015 --> 00:59:27.283
Answer me.

738
00:59:28.585 --> 00:59:30.353
Why are you here?

739
00:59:31.921 --> 00:59:33.323
It is none of your business.

740
00:59:33.323 --> 00:59:35.992
No, I have to know.

741
00:59:36.359 --> 00:59:38.261
That patient has needle marks.

742
00:59:38.328 --> 00:59:39.729
Are those from drugs?

743
00:59:41.698 --> 00:59:43.433
What is wrong with the patient?

744
00:59:43.433 --> 00:59:46.469
The vegetation of tricuspid.

745
00:59:47.337 --> 00:59:49.305
That is, I see lumps of germs.

746
00:59:49.305 --> 00:59:51.307
It's infectious endocarditis.

747
00:59:52.876 --> 00:59:54.911
The most common cause...

748
00:59:55.712 --> 00:59:57.747
is illegal drug use.

749
00:59:59.015 --> 01:00:00.516
He won't need surgery right now,

750
01:00:01.084 --> 01:00:03.152
but he might need it depending on his progress.

751
01:00:03.519 --> 01:00:04.921
Answer me now.

752
01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:08.224
Who is that person, and why are you here?

753
01:00:11.895 --> 01:00:14.397
And why do you have a wound on your shoulder?

754
01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:28.845
(Emergency Medical Center)

755
01:00:29.112 --> 01:00:30.113
Yes, Mr. Director.

756
01:00:34.751 --> 01:00:35.919
Director?

757
01:00:36.653 --> 01:00:38.888
You should've followed him right away if you lost him.

758
01:00:38.888 --> 01:00:40.857
How could you let him come to the hospital?

759
01:00:41.024 --> 01:00:42.725
Do you know what Chairman Park is like?

760
01:00:42.959 --> 01:00:45.795
He could either make us or break us.

761
01:00:45.795 --> 01:00:47.797
Do you want to ruin...

762
01:00:48.064 --> 01:00:49.365
everything we worked hard for?

763
01:00:50.934 --> 01:00:51.935
You must...

764
01:00:52.502 --> 01:00:53.703
take him back.

765
01:00:54.437 --> 01:00:56.773
That's how you...

766
01:00:57.273 --> 01:00:58.341
and I will survive.

767
01:01:22.665 --> 01:01:23.866
Is that patient...

768
01:01:25.268 --> 01:01:27.003
the son of that chairman?

769
01:01:29.572 --> 01:01:30.974
Is that what you're up to these days?

770
01:01:32.408 --> 01:01:35.011
Are you taking care of rich and powerful people?

771
01:01:35.078 --> 01:01:36.579
I told you to not care...

772
01:01:36.713 --> 01:01:38.281
about whatever I do.

773
01:01:38.281 --> 01:01:41.184
I know that it is hard for you after what happened in Joseon.

774
01:01:41.217 --> 01:01:43.953
I know that's why you're pushing me away and hiding from me.

775
01:01:43.953 --> 01:01:45.288
I can stand that,

776
01:01:45.688 --> 01:01:47.857
but I can't watch you cross the line as a doctor.

777
01:01:48.725 --> 01:01:50.326
The line as a doctor?

778
01:01:51.928 --> 01:01:53.563
Are you talking about the line as a doctor?

779
01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:55.498
What is that?

780
01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:59.469
Did you not see that from Joseon?

781
01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:01.804
What results are sometimes caused...

782
01:02:02.105 --> 01:02:04.307
by the duty and good will of a doctor?

783
01:02:08.144 --> 01:02:10.947
You said it was not the doctor's place to judge...

784
01:02:10.947 --> 01:02:12.882
whether saving a person would be beneficial or harmful.

785
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:15.952
But I will determine...

786
01:02:16.085 --> 01:02:18.721
what will be beneficial or harmful for me.

787
01:02:18.721 --> 01:02:21.724
If that is what has to be done to not live like a dog anymore,

788
01:02:23.393 --> 01:02:25.294
I will cross that line...

789
01:02:26.062 --> 01:02:27.463
as a doctor.

790
01:02:27.463 --> 01:02:29.132
This isn't Joseon.

791
01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.536
Do you think that it is that different?

792
01:02:38.341 --> 01:02:39.876
This is better.

793
01:02:40.777 --> 01:02:42.178
Let us part ways...

794
01:02:42.678 --> 01:02:45.014
since you are done checking.

795
01:03:02.799 --> 01:03:04.167
What are those people?

796
01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:05.368
I will take the patient with me.

797
01:03:05.368 --> 01:03:06.469
You can't.

798
01:03:07.303 --> 01:03:08.838
That patient should receive hospital treatment.

799
01:03:08.838 --> 01:03:10.540
Did you not say that he does not need surgery?

800
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:11.741
Even if he doesn't,

801
01:03:11.741 --> 01:03:13.643
it doesn't mean that he can be discharged.

802
01:03:13.776 --> 01:03:15.578
He has a family doctor.

803
01:03:15.578 --> 01:03:16.979
Endocarditis...

804
01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:20.283
can suddenly get worse.

805
01:03:20.283 --> 01:03:21.517
If he gets his symptoms treated improperly...

806
01:03:21.517 --> 01:03:23.619
at a non-medical institution,

807
01:03:24.187 --> 01:03:25.888
he might die.

808
01:03:43.306 --> 01:03:44.974
I'm the attending physician of this patient.

809
01:03:45.775 --> 01:03:46.943
What are you doing right now?

810
01:03:46.943 --> 01:03:49.178
He's getting discharged because he wants to.

811
01:03:49.745 --> 01:03:51.080
That's not true.

812
01:03:51.447 --> 01:03:53.416
Please don't send me back.

813
01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:55.785
He's my patient.

814
01:03:56.085 --> 01:03:57.854
He can't go anywhere without my permission.

815
01:03:57.854 --> 01:03:59.889
- Please make way. - No.

816
01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:04.494
- Hey. - What's happening?

817
01:04:04.494 --> 01:04:05.895
We got a call from the nurse here.

818
01:04:05.895 --> 01:04:07.296
What's happening?

819
01:04:07.296 --> 01:04:08.998
It's like a scene from a movie.

820
01:04:08.998 --> 01:04:11.167
Should we stop them with our bodies?

821
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.735
Yes, stop them.

822
01:04:12.735 --> 01:04:13.970
Hey.

823
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:16.139
- Wait a minute. - Oh, my.

824
01:04:16.139 --> 01:04:17.240
- Oh, my. - Make way.

825
01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.608
- Stop. - Hey.

826
01:04:18.608 --> 01:04:21.210
- Move. - What are you doing?

827
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:23.846
- Let go. - What are you doing?

828
01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.148
What is this?

829
01:04:25.148 --> 01:04:28.117
I found this while I was investigating Heo Bong Tak.

830
01:04:32.054 --> 01:04:34.323
These are the houses of Chairman Park and Chairman Yang.

831
01:04:34.357 --> 01:04:35.525
What...

832
01:04:36.092 --> 01:04:37.960
is he doing outside the hospital?

833
01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:42.365
- Let him go. - This is a hospital.

834
01:04:42.365 --> 01:04:44.167
- Let go. - I'm not going home.

835
01:04:44.167 --> 01:04:47.003
I'm not going home.

836
01:04:54.477 --> 01:04:55.645
Dr. Choi.

837
01:04:56.579 --> 01:04:57.613
Move.

838
01:05:06.722 --> 01:05:07.823
No.

839
01:05:08.558 --> 01:05:09.792
I won't do that.

840
01:05:11.494 --> 01:05:12.728
- Min Jae. - Yes?

841
01:05:12.728 --> 01:05:14.830
Collect blood from the patient, and go to the examination room.

842
01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:15.831
Okay.

843
01:05:15.831 --> 01:05:18.401
Nurse Jung, please get a room for him.

844
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:19.969
- Okay. - It looks...

845
01:05:20.803 --> 01:05:22.772
like you should get treated first.

846
01:05:24.607 --> 01:05:27.877
How will you treat patients when you're always trembling like that?

847
01:05:29.879 --> 01:05:31.914
Do you have any right to call yourself a doctor?

848
01:05:40.389 --> 01:05:41.724
Take the patient outside.

849
01:05:48.197 --> 01:05:52.201
Doctor, I don't want to go.

850
01:05:52.335 --> 01:05:54.804
- Doctor, please. - Be careful.

851
01:05:55.171 --> 01:05:56.772
Are you crazy? Let me go.

852
01:06:32.541 --> 01:06:35.544
(Live Up To Your Name, Dr. Heo)

853
01:06:37.146 --> 01:06:39.015
Do I have a right as a doctor?

854
01:06:39.882 --> 01:06:40.916
Here.

855
01:06:41.284 --> 01:06:42.285
Take that, and leave.

856
01:06:42.285 --> 01:06:45.821
When will you stop being affected from that?

857
01:06:46.822 --> 01:06:49.892
The heart's pulse is stopping.

858
01:06:49.892 --> 01:06:52.495
Is anyone there? Help.

859
01:06:53.496 --> 01:06:55.264
Apologize first.

860
01:06:55.598 --> 01:06:56.732
Go straight.

861
01:06:57.066 --> 01:06:59.735
I have something to tell her.

862
01:07:00.136 --> 01:07:03.639
You have to live a healthy life.
