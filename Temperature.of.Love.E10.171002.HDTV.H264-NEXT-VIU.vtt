00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:21.370
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.470
Why didn't you go home yet?

3
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:27.610
You know that I started working here because of you, right?

4
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:28.781
Yes, I know.

5
00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:30.810
I have a family to support.

6
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.681
I can't work here if I can't earn the minimum cost of living.

7
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.121
My restaurant isn't going to go bankrupt.

8
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.560
You must have a lot of free time to worry about useless things.

9
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:41.161
I'm going to bombard you with work.

10
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:42.721
Yes, Chef.

11
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.261
Everyone else left, right?

12
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:52.670
Hey, are you practicing with the restaurant's ingredients?

13
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.170
You know that we're not doing well.

14
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.570
I bought the ingredients.

15
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.710
Go home. Mind your own business.

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.981
Give me that. I'll teach you.

17
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:03.210
Watch and learn.

18
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210
Cut that nonsense, and just go.

19
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.751
Do you think you're all that just because you're good with knives?

20
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:11.391
You're too dumb to become a fine dining chef.

21
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:13.990
Forget it. I was just offering to help.

22
00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:17.091
All you did is graduate from CIA.

23
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:19.501
You don't even know the basics of cooking. How will you...

24
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.900
- ever become a fine dining chef? - Hey!

25
00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:31.240
Whatever you mess up, use it for when you make the carrot butter.

26
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.281
Yes, Chef.

27
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.441
Clean up before you go home.

28
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:37.680
Yes, Chef. By the way,

29
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.281
you know the Michelin Guide is going to be announced in November, right?

30
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.591
I decided to work for you for one reason.

31
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.831
I was confident that your restaurant will receive a Michelin star.

32
00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:52.031
And what if I don't?

33
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:53.960
I'm going to quit without having any regrets.

34
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.201
You must be very competitive.

35
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.841
Okay, then. I'll put trust in your confidence as well.

36
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.580
Are you cold?

37
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:10.610
My body temperature keeps fluctuating.

38
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.181
I'm hot one second, and I'm cold the other.

39
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.521
Menopause isn't fun at all.

40
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.121
Should we call Hyun Soo and ask her for the passcode?

41
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.621
No.

42
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.031
She may be our daughter, but we still need to respect her privacy.

43
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:28.431
We raised her that way. We told her to be independent.

44
00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:30.371
So we can't be the ones to break that.

45
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.670
But you're cold right now.

46
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.800
It's okay.

47
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:38.170
You're standing by my side.

48
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:41.781
And my body will recover once my menopause goes away.

49
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.980
We're also going to retire and go on a cruise.

50
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:49.380
Let's hang in there for a better tomorrow.

51
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:53.920
Whenever I think about...

52
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.491
going on a cruise with you after retirement,

53
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.401
I become so happy.

54
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.800
Honey, Hyun Soo's here.

55
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.610
It's Hyun Soo.

56
00:03:13.311 --> 00:03:14.480
You don't need to come.

57
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.880
We'll ruin the mood if we go.

58
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.880
What mood?

59
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.450
Good night.

60
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:23.721
You should go first.

61
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.290
That's it?

62
00:03:30.561 --> 00:03:32.130
I thought he'd go in with her.

63
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.401
How lame.

64
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.800
My goodness, Ms. Park Min Ah.

65
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.330
Let's go.

66
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.600
- Surprise! - Surprise!

67
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.670
Mom. Dad.

68
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.010
We saw the article.

69
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.651
We came after hearing that you decided to sleep at home tonight.

70
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.221
Hyun Soo, what about me?

71
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.390
You should join us, Dad.

72
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.531
Wait, I can't reach my hands.

73
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:07.330
- Watch out! - Oh no!

74
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.700
We're going to fall down.

75
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.300
- Be careful. - Let's be careful.

76
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.130
- Okay. - Good.

77
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.641
I have a family to support.

78
00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:23.651
I can't work here if I can't earn the minimum cost of living.

79
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.790
I'm going to quit without having any regrets.

80
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:33.420
The restaurant will close before I leave anyways.

81
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.531
(Jung Woo)

82
00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:50.170
(On Jung Sun Accept Decline)

83
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:54.281
Yes.

84
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.451
I need to talk to you. Can you come here tomorrow morning?

85
00:04:57.651 --> 00:04:59.050
I'll go there right now.

86
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.250
If you want to talk, I'll go to you whenever, wherever you are.

87
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.850
Come on, Jung Woo.

88
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.690
I said it for old time's sake.

89
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.110
I want beer.

90
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.471
You have to drive.

91
00:05:25.011 --> 00:05:27.581
I just said I want it, not that I'd drink it.

92
00:05:32.781 --> 00:05:34.781
It's been eight months since we opened the restaurant.

93
00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:36.750
We've been in deficit all this time.

94
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.761
We only have four months left until the investment period ends.

95
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.461
I'll have to decide four months later...

96
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.560
whether or not to have Chef On Jung Sun...

97
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.800
continue to manage Good Soup.

98
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.701
I decided that if I want to protect the Good Soup family,

99
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:54.600
I'll have to do things I don't want to do.

100
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:56.540
You're going on that show?

101
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.641
You're smart. You caught it right away.

102
00:05:59.711 --> 00:06:02.781
This is why I like you. You're realistic.

103
00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:08.050
I told you to shower.

104
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.951
I will once you two leave.

105
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.990
We're not leaving tonight.

106
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.290
Our daughter's in trouble. We have to stay with you.

107
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.401
Of course. This is what family is for.

108
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:25.430
Let's not talk about work.

109
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.000
You'll take care of it on your own. We don't know much about it.

110
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.540
Who's the man who dropped you off?

111
00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:33.940
He's tall and handsome.

112
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:36.810
He's the head of our production company.

113
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.810
He's the head of your production company?

114
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.881
He seemed young.

115
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.891
Gosh. He's a gifted fellow.

116
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:45.021
Is he married?

117
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:46.050
No.

118
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.761
He was never married?

119
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.131
No, he hasn't been married.

120
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.831
What about his parents?

121
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:53.701
What do they do?

122
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.430
Do they get along?

123
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.971
Both his parents passed away.

124
00:06:57.971 --> 00:07:00.271
I don't know how they were before then.

125
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:04.471
Hyun Soo, you're so honest.

126
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.081
You're answering all her questions.

127
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:13.120
If the situation was bad enough for someone like you to make a fuss,

128
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:15.381
how horrible was that director to you?

129
00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:21.821
I said we shouldn't talk about it.

130
00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:25.591
Work is the biggest issue in her life right now.

131
00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:27.261
How can we just ignore it?

132
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:29.131
She needs some place to let it out.

133
00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:32.571
Hyun Soo.

134
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.071
That is what parents are for.

135
00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:40.841
She's crying now.

136
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:45.911
I didn't want to talk about it as I didn't want to see her cry.

137
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:56.631
You should cry when you're with us.

138
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.730
You can't cry in front of the director.

139
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.631
Go ahead and cry.

140
00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:07.771
Cry as much as you want.

141
00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:13.110
This is my loving family.

142
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:15.911
The catch here...

143
00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:19.850
was although I was crying because of work, all I could think about...

144
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:23.451
was one man.

145
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:46.310
Wait.

146
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.111
Jung Sun.

147
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.981
Jung Sun.

148
00:08:49.981 --> 00:08:51.810
Hey, On Jung Sun!

149
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:53.820
On Jung Sun!

150
00:08:57.621 --> 00:08:59.761
Why are you screaming my name?

151
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:00.960
So that you'd hear me.

152
00:09:03.891 --> 00:09:06.300
I heard you. Why are you here?

153
00:09:06.761 --> 00:09:08.131
We still have to talk.

154
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.371
Our conversation was cut short yesterday.

155
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:14.641
You're going to work already?

156
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:17.111
No. I live here.

157
00:09:22.281 --> 00:09:24.651
Why are you following me? I told you to wait outside.

158
00:09:25.011 --> 00:09:26.621
It's boring being on my own.

159
00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:48.141
So this is what it looks like.

160
00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:50.611
Your curiosity hasn't gone anywhere.

161
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.481
"You have a big shot boyfriend,"

162
00:09:58.481 --> 00:10:00.680
"and your dream of becoming a writer came true."

163
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.720
"Why did you regret it, and why were you hurt?"

164
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.651
What did you mean by that?

165
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.621
There's no hidden meaning.

166
00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:09.121
It's just as I said.

167
00:10:09.891 --> 00:10:11.131
No, no.

168
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:13.861
I have a big-shot boyfriend?

169
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:17.670
How would you know when even I don't know who that is.

170
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.101
I heard about it.

171
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.501
From who?

172
00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:26.741
Who would so generously pass on that lie?

173
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.651
I didn't know you were so hasty.

174
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:34.881
You should have asked me. Why did you believe what someone else said?

175
00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:37.351
How would I ask you when you didn't pick up my calls?

176
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:39.590
When did I not pick up your calls?

177
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.060
I mean...

178
00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:48.001
I had something going on then.

179
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:50.330
Everyone has something going on, but they still pick up.

180
00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:54.601
Because trust is more important.

181
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.720
Why?

182
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.491
Aren't you going to leave?

183
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:16.391
Isn't it cold?

184
00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:19.601
Don't be nice. It makes me feel good.

185
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:23.601
You're still so odd just like old days.

186
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.170
Is it true that we might not be able to leave because the door is closed?

187
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.310
That's how it always is in TV shows.

188
00:11:56.601 --> 00:11:58.200
You seem so disappointed.

189
00:11:59.401 --> 00:12:00.800
You want to be locked in here?

190
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.111
I don't have a big-shot boyfriend.

191
00:12:06.111 --> 00:12:07.210
You said that earlier.

192
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.080
- So you get it? - Yes.

193
00:12:13.351 --> 00:12:14.820
Do you have a girlfriend?

194
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:19.521
No.

195
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:21.521
Why not?

196
00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:23.190
Do I need a reason?

197
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.670
Were you mad because I didn't pick up the phone?

198
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:41.281
I've never been mad at you, not even once.

199
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.611
I don't get mad.

200
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.220
Can we go out now?

201
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.460
We can.

202
00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:06.800
Aren't you coming out?

203
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.710
The temperature goes up if I keep the fridge door open.

204
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.040
The ingredients will go bad.

205
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:27.190
This is nice.

206
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.731
You're the same.

207
00:13:30.891 --> 00:13:34.101
You still care about the view from your house more than anything else.

208
00:13:34.261 --> 00:13:35.800
Why did you come to this neighborhood?

209
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.300
You're finally interested in me.

210
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.371
The show that's airing right now doesn't seem to be doing well.

211
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.481
You mean do I have the leisure to be here?

212
00:13:47.781 --> 00:13:49.281
I wouldn't have if it were like before.

213
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:52.710
But my values have changed.

214
00:13:53.281 --> 00:13:54.820
I thought...

215
00:13:55.521 --> 00:13:57.651
everything would change once I reach my dreams.

216
00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:01.590
I thought a whole new world would open in front of me.

217
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:03.761
But...

218
00:14:04.631 --> 00:14:06.460
even after my dream came true,

219
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:10.731
my life is exactly the same as before.

220
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:18.141
I regretted it.

221
00:14:23.481 --> 00:14:24.611
I was hurt.

222
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.351
I gave up so much for my dream.

223
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.861
I live in this neighborhood too.

224
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.330
My office is in Yeouido.

225
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:43.031
I came hoping to run into you.

226
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.200
I wanted to apologize.

227
00:14:54.641 --> 00:14:56.040
I thought about it,

228
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.381
and it's not an easy thing to confess to someone.

229
00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.930
Don't let it bother you. It's all in the past.

230
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.460
I told you I understood back then, and I understand you now.

231
00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:18.670
I became the owner chef I wanted to become.

232
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.340
Good Soup is the only thing on my mind these days.

233
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.670
Don't be sorry about the past. The present is more important.

234
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:28.281
Let's just be faithful to our own lives.

235
00:15:29.911 --> 00:15:30.981
Our own lives?

236
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.851
Do you think I came here to talk about that?

237
00:15:36.151 --> 00:15:38.720
I told you that I regretted it. I told you I was hurt.

238
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:40.190
What do you think I meant by that?

239
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.491
I told you I understood you then and that I still do.

240
00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:44.861
I told you I only think about Good Soup.

241
00:15:45.631 --> 00:15:47.131
What do you think I meant by that?

242
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.131
Are you rejecting me?

243
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.930
Lee Hyun Soo, you never disappoint me.

244
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.040
You're so straightforward. It caught me by surprise.

245
00:15:56.771 --> 00:15:58.771
You would never let me win.

246
00:15:58.771 --> 00:16:00.381
Why should I?

247
00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:05.481
I'll reject.

248
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.690
What?

249
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.550
You didn't think I would reject you, right?

250
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:14.121
Saying that you regretted it won't fix everything.

251
00:16:14.261 --> 00:16:16.090
Can we turn back time?

252
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.290
Do you think I was happy all those years?

253
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.501
- You're holding a grudge. - You're too late.

254
00:16:25.231 --> 00:16:27.741
"It's not an easy thing"...

255
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:29.611
"to confess to someone"?

256
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.371
Did you only realize that now?

257
00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.450
Don't expect to find a man that will cater to you.

258
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.720
They only exist in fantasies created by women.

259
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:52.731
You're right.

260
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.960
I love how fast you are at coming to terms.

261
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.470
I'm a real guy,

262
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.641
so treat me like one.

263
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:04.811
How does one treat a man like a real guy?

264
00:17:05.611 --> 00:17:08.010
Think about it. You're good at it.

265
00:17:08.311 --> 00:17:09.450
You're smart.

266
00:17:11.411 --> 00:17:13.520
Can you date me in a situation like this?

267
00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:17.020
You said you changed, but people don't change.

268
00:17:17.821 --> 00:17:19.621
You're so full of it.

269
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.391
That's why you should have accepted me...

270
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.631
when I loved you and begged you.

271
00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.670
You didn't beg that much.

272
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.270
I'd be a stalker if I went any further.

273
00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:34.601
Do you want a criminal?

274
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:36.970
Forget it.

275
00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:38.411
Forget it.

276
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.341
Do you want breakfast? You didn't eat yet, right?

277
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:43.611
What are you doing?

278
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:46.551
If you're rejecting me, do it right. Don't leave me any room.

279
00:17:48.351 --> 00:17:49.651
Are you sure?

280
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.591
No...

281
00:18:03.071 --> 00:18:04.101
Yes, Kyung.

282
00:18:04.631 --> 00:18:07.341
Hyun Soo, the script for the eighth episode is online.

283
00:18:07.341 --> 00:18:08.801
We never sent it.

284
00:18:09.371 --> 00:18:10.641
They found a new writer.

285
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.611
I'll be right there.

286
00:18:15.111 --> 00:18:16.280
Did something happen?

287
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:18.710
Yes, a lot happened. Bye.

288
00:18:19.311 --> 00:18:20.720
You'll trip. Be careful.

289
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.720
No, I won't.

290
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.351
You look so cheerful when you hop like that.

291
00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:26.121
I'm cheerful.

292
00:18:26.591 --> 00:18:28.321
You didn't reject me for good.

293
00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:35.577
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E10 Temperature of Love "What Do You Mean By That?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

294
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.770
Hyun Soo.

295
00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:44.111
Won Joon?

296
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:45.611
What are you doing here?

297
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.311
I work here.

298
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:48.541
I work for Jung Sun.

299
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:52.280
You wanted to cook,

300
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.551
and now you're doing what you want.

301
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.780
I was lucky.

302
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.420
I'm busy, so I can't talk right now. I'll come back later.

303
00:18:59.591 --> 00:19:02.591
- You have my number, right? - Yes.

304
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.990
Can you text me Jung Sun's number?

305
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.331
Okay.

306
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.331
- Bye. - Bye.

307
00:19:15.401 --> 00:19:16.510
Is Mr. Park in?

308
00:19:16.571 --> 00:19:18.111
Did you make an appointment?

309
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:19.740
Don't you know me?

310
00:19:20.141 --> 00:19:22.111
Why would you ask? What a bother.

311
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.950
You should learn to be flexible when you work.

312
00:19:25.351 --> 00:19:26.980
You look more beautiful today than usual.

313
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.020
That's a given. Don't waste your time.

314
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:39.801
I came to tell you about a good exhibition.

315
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.970
Is that so? I like exhibitions.

316
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.371
Professor Min is holding a solo exhibition.

317
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.541
(Min Daniel Solo Exhibition)

318
00:19:50.541 --> 00:19:51.670
I see.

319
00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:56.311
You should come by and purchase his work.

320
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.121
I saw his stuff at the studio before.

321
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.051
You didn't buy any then either.

322
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:08.821
You're close to Jung Sun like real brothers.

323
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.030
I have a positive image of you.

324
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.730
Okay, then. I don't think I can buy one of his pieces,

325
00:20:15.401 --> 00:20:17.301
but let me know if you need anything.

326
00:20:20.601 --> 00:20:22.000
We don't need anything.

327
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.141
Then I'll pick out something and send it to you.

328
00:20:27.881 --> 00:20:31.210
Don't tell Jung Sun that I came by.

329
00:20:31.611 --> 00:20:33.180
He's too strict.

330
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.091
He thinks it's a sin to receive something from someone.

331
00:20:36.891 --> 00:20:38.091
He'll be mad if he finds out.

332
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.861
Don't worry, I won't tell him.

333
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.831
I'm so glad you're beside Jung Sun.

334
00:20:45.831 --> 00:20:47.230
I'm relieved.

335
00:20:49.901 --> 00:20:51.901
Aren't Daniel's paintings good?

336
00:20:52.101 --> 00:20:53.940
They resemble Vincent van Gogh's.

337
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.480
Soo Young called me saying that she'll become...

338
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.020
the writer for "Unruly Detectives" and apologized.

339
00:21:07.381 --> 00:21:09.450
Park Eun Sung will be proofreading.

340
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.920
(Director Min Yi Bok)

341
00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:21.030
Yes, this is Min Yi Bok.

342
00:21:21.301 --> 00:21:23.230
Director, let's meet.

343
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:25.831
You should write a script instead.

344
00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.940
I saw episode eight's script that you uploaded.

345
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.341
It wasn't what I wrote.

346
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.381
My assistant director uploaded it as a mistake.

347
00:21:34.911 --> 00:21:37.180
How can he upload a script that doesn't exist?

348
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:39.520
Did you talk to Hong Jin?

349
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.121
He was yelling at me.

350
00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.680
Let's talk.

351
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.321
I have nothing to talk about.

352
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.720
I do.

353
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.000
What's this? She just hung up.

354
00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.270
She's so rude.

355
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.740
It's for the better.

356
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.611
It's better to acknowledge Soo Young's work...

357
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:05.571
instead of having her as a shadow writer.

358
00:22:06.311 --> 00:22:09.450
Let's not only focus on your personal gains.

359
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.450
Ms. Park, can't you help me while you're at it?

360
00:22:12.651 --> 00:22:13.780
Okay.

361
00:22:17.551 --> 00:22:19.391
(Hong Jin)

362
00:22:21.121 --> 00:22:22.161
Yes.

363
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.730
Where are you?

364
00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:25.430
I told you to come to the office.

365
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.401
I'm working. I'm editing the script.

366
00:22:28.161 --> 00:22:30.030
The writers can't write well, so I'll write it myself.

367
00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.331
Just come. Come here for now.

368
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:35.240
(Unruly Detectives)

369
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:36.710
Hello?

370
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.510
Goodness.

371
00:22:38.841 --> 00:22:42.041
What's this? Why would you hang up when I'm talking?

372
00:22:43.051 --> 00:22:45.811
What am I putting myself through for picking the wrong writer?

373
00:22:45.811 --> 00:22:47.121
Director Min.

374
00:22:47.121 --> 00:22:49.720
What about our script do you not like?

375
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.161
Why should Shin Ha Rim ask for a favor here?

376
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.091
No way.

377
00:22:57.091 --> 00:22:58.831
What is it now?

378
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.061
It's Hyun Soo.

379
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.270
Who?

380
00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.170
Hyun Soo.

381
00:23:05.601 --> 00:23:08.170
- Oh, my. - What?

382
00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:11.510
She's driving me crazy.

383
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.980
You're right.

384
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.710
Gosh, you're right.

385
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.450
- My heart is racing. - This is crazy.

386
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.651
What kind of situation is this?

387
00:23:21.551 --> 00:23:24.821
I feel like I was caught red-handed.

388
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.420
Have you had an affair before?

389
00:23:26.821 --> 00:23:30.331
Soo Young! Why don't you ever understand anything?

390
00:23:30.331 --> 00:23:31.631
Just open the door.

391
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:32.730
Okay.

392
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:35.801
- Goodness. - I can't breathe.

393
00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:37.430
Do something.

394
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.700
I don't know why she's here.

395
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.801
Why did she come?

396
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.740
It's been a while.

397
00:23:42.841 --> 00:23:44.141
Yes. Come in.

398
00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:48.081
I helped you because you begged me,

399
00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:50.280
but you need to get things organized around you.

400
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.280
I have a lot of experience working with writers,

401
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.720
but she's the first to act so unexpectedly.

402
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.020
I can't prepare for it.

403
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.391
How can I prepare myself when she acts so unpredictable?

404
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:01.020
Hello, Ms. Park.

405
00:24:01.121 --> 00:24:02.161
Yes, hello.

406
00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:05.591
We should see each other for good reasons, but I'm in a pickle.

407
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.500
I came because I have to talk to Director Min.

408
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.470
Before you begin, let me finish.

409
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:13.101
Director Min.

410
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:16.170
I was going to help you,

411
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.010
but this isn't working out.

412
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.381
It's uncomfortable for me to see my past pupil.

413
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.780
All right.

414
00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.051
Episode eight needs to be fixed anyway.

415
00:24:26.051 --> 00:24:27.420
It wasn't good enough.

416
00:24:27.881 --> 00:24:29.821
What are you saying?

417
00:24:29.851 --> 00:24:32.821
I worked all night because you begged me to help you.

418
00:24:32.821 --> 00:24:34.321
- I worked so... - Thank you, Ms. Park.

419
00:24:34.321 --> 00:24:35.321
Oh, my.

420
00:24:35.321 --> 00:24:37.131
Let's go out. We'll talk outside.

421
00:24:37.631 --> 00:24:39.430
What is this? Is this it?

422
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.430
I'll buy you drinks later!

423
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:44.401
Do you think I'm dying to have drinks?

424
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.371
Gosh.

425
00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:47.970
Director Min!

426
00:24:48.871 --> 00:24:49.911
Goodness.

427
00:24:57.911 --> 00:25:00.821
I'll see you another time when you're feeling normal.

428
00:25:03.391 --> 00:25:04.490
Ms. Park.

429
00:25:05.121 --> 00:25:06.821
Do you remember when you told me...

430
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.490
you've never seen someone so evil in your 10 years of writing?

431
00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.331
People say anything when they're upset.

432
00:25:13.331 --> 00:25:15.331
It's in the past. You're a writer now.

433
00:25:15.331 --> 00:25:17.331
You also said this.

434
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.131
You'll become a writer.

435
00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:22.141
It's the evil ones that succeed in this industry.

436
00:25:22.601 --> 00:25:24.111
Were you holding grudges?

437
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:26.280
I was really upset then...

438
00:25:26.581 --> 00:25:28.341
because I was actually innocent.

439
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.151
I really worked hard.

440
00:25:30.581 --> 00:25:33.121
I sincerely wanted you to do well.

441
00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:38.020
It was shocking to hear that from someone I respected.

442
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.220
However, I think you have a knack for seeing things in people.

443
00:25:43.161 --> 00:25:45.030
It's true, I'm evil.

444
00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.530
I hope we never see each other.

445
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:54.170
Starting today, I'll be talking bad about you.

446
00:26:01.081 --> 00:26:02.141
No way.

447
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:07.980
Ms. Park.

448
00:26:32.111 --> 00:26:33.780
I didn't know beef tendon could be so good.

449
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.611
It's because of the chocolate.

450
00:26:35.611 --> 00:26:36.980
This is amazing.

451
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:39.720
How did they think of using beef tendon in a dessert?

452
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.581
Have you seen the chef?

453
00:26:41.821 --> 00:26:43.420
He's so handsome.

454
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:45.121
I know, right?

455
00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:47.920
Let's come back.

456
00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.121
Okay.

457
00:26:53.331 --> 00:26:55.230
- Let's upload it on Instagram. - Okay.

458
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.631
Doesn't it look good?

459
00:26:57.071 --> 00:26:58.930
- Yes. - It's too pretty to eat.

460
00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:00.641
It's so cute.

461
00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.500
(Please give us the next menu.)

462
00:27:02.601 --> 00:27:05.770
(It was delicious.)

463
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.480
How cute.

464
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.581
They must have enjoyed our food.

465
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:12.920
You're so childish.

466
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.920
What is?

467
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.651
You're complimenting yourself.

468
00:27:15.651 --> 00:27:17.220
Why are you so cranky?

469
00:27:18.391 --> 00:27:20.321
Hey, don't take them.

470
00:27:20.321 --> 00:27:22.520
- Why not? - I need to take pictures.

471
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.831
All right. Hurry up, then.

472
00:27:24.861 --> 00:27:27.760
Don't you know what romantic means?

473
00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:36.770
Did they finish it?

474
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.371
They cleared the desserts too.

475
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.980
- That's right. - Awesome.

476
00:27:42.311 --> 00:27:43.311
Are you that happy?

477
00:27:43.311 --> 00:27:44.911
Of course.

478
00:27:45.081 --> 00:27:46.621
Anybody have plans after work?

479
00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:50.291
If you're free, let's go run. It'll be a team workshop.

480
00:27:50.321 --> 00:27:51.621
Do you have something to talk about?

481
00:27:51.621 --> 00:27:54.091
Yes. I decided to agree on a television appearance.

482
00:27:55.061 --> 00:27:57.430
- No way. - You all have to focus.

483
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.430
There will be days when I'm away.

484
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.631
The sous-chef and you guys will have to fill for me.

485
00:28:01.631 --> 00:28:02.661
Can you do it?

486
00:28:02.661 --> 00:28:04.230
- Yes, we can! - Yes, we can!

487
00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:19.720
Ready...

488
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.851
Go!

489
00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.341
All you do is talk.

490
00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.911
You're so unfit.

491
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:52.680
All you can do is run.

492
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.250
Are you bickering again?

493
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.651
You two can go again.

494
00:28:56.891 --> 00:28:58.520
I'll put 10 dollars on Kyung Soo.

495
00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.690
Where did you learn such a thing?

496
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.161
This won't do. We should all go for another round.

497
00:29:03.161 --> 00:29:06.061
The loser will have to do dishes for a week.

498
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:08.861
Okay. Yes, something like this will make me want to run.

499
00:29:08.861 --> 00:29:10.331
What's wrong with him?

500
00:29:10.331 --> 00:29:11.631
Hurry up.

501
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.641
- Good. - Soup.

502
00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:18.911
- Good. - Soup.

503
00:29:18.911 --> 00:29:20.411
I can't hear you. Let's go, Good Soup!

504
00:29:20.411 --> 00:29:21.411
Let's go!

505
00:29:21.411 --> 00:29:22.980
- Ready, go! - Gosh.

506
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.801
Are you saying you'll shoot this? Are you crazy?

507
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.661
No, not with this script.

508
00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.730
Then what are you going to do?

509
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:45.270
You don't like Ms. Lee's writing,

510
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.541
and you don't like the writing done by someone else.

511
00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:50.020
There aren't enough writers around.

512
00:29:50.045 --> 00:29:51.170
I should just write it myself.

513
00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.280
I would write better than this even with my foot.

514
00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.710
Are you going to quit the company after this?

515
00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.311
Or are you being difficult to make yourself be worth more?

516
00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.750
Come on.

517
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.881
Just find an agreement with Ms. Lee.

518
00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:03.651
She has everything written already,

519
00:30:03.651 --> 00:30:05.420
and it's consistent.

520
00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.190
You should try to work off from that.

521
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:09.591
If you keep this up, you'll mess up the schedule.

522
00:30:09.591 --> 00:30:11.831
She won't listen to me.

523
00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:14.530
I've never seen a good writer that listens well.

524
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:15.700
What about Shin Ha Rim?

525
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.700
He acts like a director on set.

526
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.071
It's driving me crazy.

527
00:30:20.071 --> 00:30:22.170
I know it's hard for you,

528
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.010
but you're making it more difficult for yourself.

529
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.411
Also, Ms. Lee isn't like others.

530
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:28.480
You know how she's like.

531
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.581
I know.

532
00:30:29.581 --> 00:30:32.551
I thought she'd be nice since she's so frail and smiles a lot.

533
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.720
I didn't know she'd make a scene.

534
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.851
Please stop making it hard for me, and try to work together.

535
00:30:38.051 --> 00:30:39.861
I'm going to die early because of you.

536
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:41.920
The higher-ups are pressuring me because of the ratings,

537
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.631
and say that we need to get more advertisements.

538
00:30:43.631 --> 00:30:46.530
What a mess. We have an early shoot tomorrow.

539
00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:50.270
Are you not finished yet?

540
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.530
No, we're done.

541
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.000
You two should talk. I'm done.

542
00:30:55.071 --> 00:30:57.170
I have something to tell you.

543
00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.980
I think it's best that Director Min is here too.

544
00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:03.381
You would feel offended if you hear about yourself somewhere else.

545
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:05.780
What is it now?

546
00:31:06.151 --> 00:31:07.881
You told me...

547
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.990
that I would be a good match with Director Min...

548
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.720
and that I should work with him.

549
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.990
Yes.

550
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.230
Please find me a new director.

551
00:31:20.901 --> 00:31:23.270
What do you think you're doing?

552
00:31:24.131 --> 00:31:27.141
At least I don't backstab someone like you.

553
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.151
(Temperature of Love)

554
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:46.561
Let's get one more writer.

555
00:31:46.561 --> 00:31:47.960
Do you know anyone you're close with?

556
00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.291
I was selected for a series at HNC.

557
00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:51.960
Have you heard of "The Menu of My Life"?

558
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.000
It's a show from SBC.

559
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.700
It'd be a huge opportunity if they chose your dish.

560
00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.131
I don't like Hyun Soo.

561
00:31:57.131 --> 00:32:00.141
I want to go up even if it means crushing my friend.

562
00:32:00.141 --> 00:32:02.541
I was hoping you'd notice my ambition.

563
00:32:02.541 --> 00:32:04.141
They're a little strange.

564
00:32:04.141 --> 00:32:05.341
Are they checking each other out?

565
00:32:05.341 --> 00:32:06.581
What do you plan on doing?

566
00:32:06.581 --> 00:32:07.881
Buy me something delicious later.

567
00:32:07.881 --> 00:32:09.141
I'm sorry, don't wait for me.

568
00:32:09.141 --> 00:32:10.950
- What does he do? - I'm sorry.

569
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.450
Who are you seeing?

570
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:13.680
I lost you once,

571
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.950
so it won't be easy to start this time.

572
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.520
(Tomorrow night at 10pm...)
