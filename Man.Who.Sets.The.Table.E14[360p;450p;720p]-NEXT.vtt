00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.758
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:09.559
Please come to the Mok-dong house.

3
00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:11.995
I need to have a word with you urgently.

4
00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:15.766
What does he have to tell me urgently?

5
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:19.936
He'll probably tell me 
to console his mother.

6
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:22.839
How shall I console her?

7
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:26.643
Should I do it like Yeon Ju?

8
00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:30.113
If you laugh, blessings will come your way.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.783
No, she will probably want 
to slap me if I do this.

10
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.120
I'll just give her 10,000 dollars like 
my usual style.

11
00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:39.222
I'll say, "There's nothing to life."

12
00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:41.458
Go on a trip somewhere.

13
00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:42.893
Spend all of that money in a day.

14
00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:44.394
I should just give her 10,000 dollars.

15
00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:45.996
Hey, drive faster.

16
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.632
What?

17
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.501
What?

18
00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:53.470
She's my daughter.

19
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.472
Han Gyul is mine.

20
00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:57.541
Are you serious?

21
00:00:57.908 --> 00:00:59.609
Is the child outside...

22
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.711
really...

23
00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.615
your daughter? Is it true?

24
00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:08.518
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:36.113
Oh, my. You must be her.

26
00:01:36.113 --> 00:01:38.315
You know how to open the door?

27
00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:39.816
You're my in-law.

28
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.287
Gosh, you are the spitting image of Yeon Ju's father-in-law.

29
00:01:52.462 --> 00:01:55.132
Why is it so quiet in here?

30
00:01:57.033 --> 00:02:00.637
Missy, where is your dad?

31
00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:01.671
Dad?

32
00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:05.775
Your dad is inside the room?

33
00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:07.477
I see.

34
00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:09.779
Let's go.

35
00:02:10.147 --> 00:02:12.582
Oh, my. She dropped the honorifics.

36
00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:14.684
Hold on.

37
00:02:14.784 --> 00:02:17.387
I, a woman of elegance, can't open...

38
00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:20.590
my in-law's bedroom door even if we're close.

39
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:24.494
I'm going to wait out here.

40
00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:27.063
Please go into the room,

41
00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:29.566
and bring your daddy out here, okay?

42
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.580
This much money will put an end to all of this.

43
00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:51.021
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Yeon Ju.

44
00:02:51.555 --> 00:02:53.490
I know how you must feel right now.

45
00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:55.992
I'm sure you are shivering with the sense of betrayal.

46
00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.628
However, it was never my intention to hide it from you.

47
00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:01.164
Father was trying to protect me, and this happened.

48
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.968
Anyhow,

49
00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.271
I'm too ashamed of myself to face you...

50
00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.574
or Mom.

51
00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.010
All right.

52
00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:16.880
If you know what happened, you'll understand.

53
00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.249
We didn't deceive you.

54
00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:21.985
It was a mistake he made before he married you.

55
00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:24.788
This is an extenuating circumstance.

56
00:03:24.988 --> 00:03:28.491
So calm down.

57
00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:30.827
After you hear the whole story...

58
00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:37.701
Why did you come in? The adults are talking.

59
00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:38.835
Stay outside.

60
00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:41.137
What?

61
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.642
This kid really is bad at reading the room.

62
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.010
Let's go out.

63
00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:57.454
Han Gyul, we're talking about something very important.

64
00:03:57.721 --> 00:03:58.922
Please go outside.

65
00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:03.326
Hey, hey. I don't know what's gotten into her.

66
00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.629
Hey, she's distracting.

67
00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.697
You should leave the room with Han Gyul.

68
00:04:07.797 --> 00:04:09.899
I will explain everything to her.

69
00:04:17.107 --> 00:04:18.508
You're here, Mother.

70
00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.410
How strange.

71
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.379
I asked her to bring your dad.

72
00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:24.681
Why did she bring you out here?

73
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.316
I guess she doesn't like your father...

74
00:04:26.316 --> 00:04:28.985
because he looks like an old grandpa.

75
00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:32.689
Missy, this is...

76
00:04:33.623 --> 00:04:36.993
not your dad. He's your older brother.

77
00:04:36.993 --> 00:04:38.995
He's your brother.

78
00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:40.563
No, he's my dad.

79
00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:43.233
Goodness, she likes good-looking guys too.

80
00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:45.235
She doesn't like her father because he looks old.

81
00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:47.370
I guess she wants to have a young dad.

82
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.240
But did your father go somewhere?

83
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.043
We have a lot to discuss, so why don't we go into the study?

84
00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:57.547
But where's Yeon Ju?

85
00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.115
Why is it so quiet in here?

86
00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.552
She's with Mom as she's not feeling too well.

87
00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.187
Poor her.

88
00:05:04.187 --> 00:05:06.990
I take it that your mother was deeply shocked by it.

89
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.360
I should go and comfort her.

90
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.428
No.

91
00:05:12.128 --> 00:05:14.931
She'll feel uneasy. You should stay here.

92
00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:16.800
Is that so?

93
00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:21.438
But you said you needed to talk to me.

94
00:05:21.438 --> 00:05:22.605
Go ahead.

95
00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:25.241
Mother.

96
00:05:25.442 --> 00:05:26.443
Yes?

97
00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:28.878
- The truth is... - Stop.

98
00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.548
I'm sorry, but can you give me a cup of water?

99
00:05:32.816 --> 00:05:34.117
- Water? - Yes.

100
00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:36.786
I forgot to take my medicine.

101
00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:39.389
Let's talk after I take my medicine. I'm sorry.

102
00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:43.993
Sure.

103
00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:53.169
Stop crying, Yeon Ju.

104
00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:56.373
It's my fault since I raised my son wrong.

105
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.808
I'm the one to blame here. Stop crying.

106
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.114
Goodness, this is a misunderstanding.

107
00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:08.752
Yeon Ju, once you hear the whole story, you'll understand.

108
00:06:08.752 --> 00:06:12.188
Please compose yourself, and hear me out.

109
00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:13.556
Hurry.

110
00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.230
Here you go, Yeon Ju. Here.

111
00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:24.634
Understand? How could I understand what happened?

112
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.036
Do you think you can understand Mother...

113
00:06:27.036 --> 00:06:29.439
if she had an affair and brought a child home with her?

114
00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:34.677
I can forgive So Won if he went bankrupt,

115
00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:37.680
but I cannot forgive the fact that he cheated on me.

116
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.549
He didn't cheat on you.

117
00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:42.919
So Won has never betrayed you.

118
00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.754
If he didn't have an affair, how could this happen?

119
00:06:44.754 --> 00:06:47.357
It's not like a child can appear out of nowhere.

120
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.693
That's precisely it.

121
00:06:50.693 --> 00:06:54.931
Han Gyul was conceived before So Won met you.

122
00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.234
When he was single, he got a girl pregnant.

123
00:06:58.234 --> 00:07:01.137
His ex-girlfriend gave birth by herself...

124
00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:03.440
without so much as a single word to us.

125
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.609
So Won had no idea. It was like a bolt out of the blue.

126
00:07:07.377 --> 00:07:10.880
Honey, then who is the mother?

127
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.049
Who do you think it is?

128
00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:16.419
It's that ridiculous girl. Her name was Su Mi or something.

129
00:07:17.053 --> 00:07:18.188
Su Mi?

130
00:07:19.122 --> 00:07:21.191
When So Won went to serve his duty in the army,

131
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.193
she disappeared without saying a word.

132
00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:25.695
If she was pregnant by then,

133
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:28.198
why would she disappear?

134
00:07:28.231 --> 00:07:30.600
She should've told us that. Why did she leave?

135
00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:34.170
That's true. She should've begged and gotten married.

136
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.672
Why would she leave?

137
00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:38.308
Gosh.

138
00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:40.477
Hold on.

139
00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.681
I remember that from the start, you didn't like her...

140
00:07:45.615 --> 00:07:47.684
for her qualifications.

141
00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:50.753
By any chance, did you visit her and tell her to break up with him?

142
00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:52.689
How many times do I need to tell you?

143
00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:54.290
I didn't force her to break up with him.

144
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.559
She voluntarily broke up with him.

145
00:07:59.796 --> 00:08:01.865
When So Won was an army doctor,

146
00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:04.667
that girl came to me.

147
00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:07.670
She told me that she was pregnant with his baby.

148
00:08:09.372 --> 00:08:10.440
So?

149
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.544
She made a deal with me.

150
00:08:15.612 --> 00:08:17.547
In exchange for getting an abortion,

151
00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:21.117
she wanted money for her mom's liver transplant.

152
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.291
It was her who wanted to negotiate, not vice versa.

153
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:30.360
You're unbelievable.

154
00:08:30.627 --> 00:08:32.629
You're right. As you said,

155
00:08:32.629 --> 00:08:35.131
I didn't like her from the start.

156
00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:38.535
So I only accepted her deal.

157
00:08:38.535 --> 00:08:41.137
I only trusted her promise that she will get the abortion.

158
00:08:41.137 --> 00:08:43.506
I have forgotten all about it until now.

159
00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:47.477
But she resurfaced out of nowhere after six years...

160
00:08:47.477 --> 00:08:51.114
and caused this catastrophe under the excuse of that child.

161
00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:54.117
So you made all the decisions alone even...

162
00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:57.887
without notifying So Won, the father of the child. Am I right?

163
00:08:57.987 --> 00:08:59.489
And you used money in the process?

164
00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:01.958
In other words, you've been toying...

165
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.127
with the lives of Su Mi, So Won, and your grandchild...

166
00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.029
who is outside. Aren't I right?

167
00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:08.731
Watch your tongue! What did I do wrong?

168
00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:12.669
Name one person who wouldn't make the same decision in that situation!

169
00:09:14.704 --> 00:09:17.707
I put all of my time and effort to raise So Won.

170
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:20.710
Why would I let some undeserving girl have So Won?

171
00:09:20.877 --> 00:09:23.246
I did my best for my son.

172
00:09:30.119 --> 00:09:31.955
So, Yeon Ju.

173
00:09:32.522 --> 00:09:35.892
You see how So Won has done nothing wrong, don't you?

174
00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:37.994
There are no guys...

175
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.863
who never dated once or twice before their marriage.

176
00:09:41.464 --> 00:09:44.233
So Won just got unlucky.

177
00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.571
The dice has been thrown.

178
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.240
Everything depends on you now.

179
00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:55.111
Don't you love So Won?

180
00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:59.716
Don't you? So you need to think about this carefully.

181
00:09:59.983 --> 00:10:03.319
Decide if you will end your marriage after weeping over the misfortune.

182
00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:05.088
Or if you'll be wise...

183
00:10:05.088 --> 00:10:07.490
and overcome this crisis with us.

184
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.735
What kind of medicine is it?

185
00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:22.372
My blood pressure is high.

186
00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:25.508
Besides, I had a myocardial infarction surgery a long time ago.

187
00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:27.610
I have stents inserted right here.

188
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.780
They are bothersome. So the doctor prescribed the medicine.

189
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.415
You don't have to go to the hospital?

190
00:10:32.415 --> 00:10:35.718
My doctor said I just need to avoid getting shocked.

191
00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:38.988
But what was it that you wanted to tell me?

192
00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:41.257
You're not going to shock...

193
00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:44.894
me by telling me something, are you?

194
00:10:45.028 --> 00:10:46.129
Yes?

195
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.332
That is...

196
00:10:49.532 --> 00:10:52.902
Why are you sweating so much...

197
00:10:53.503 --> 00:10:55.371
when the weather is so cold?

198
00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:56.973
Are you sick?

199
00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:00.410
I'm not.

200
00:11:01.878 --> 00:11:05.248
What is it? Hurry and tell me.

201
00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:07.650
What is it? What do you want to say?

202
00:11:08.117 --> 00:11:12.355
Mother, that is...

203
00:11:12.488 --> 00:11:16.325
What is taking you so long? You're annoying me.

204
00:11:16.626 --> 00:11:20.663
Just tell me. I'm almost like your real mother.

205
00:11:21.364 --> 00:11:23.266
Did you do something wrong?

206
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.234
Just confess.

207
00:11:25.234 --> 00:11:27.737
I'll forgive everything. What is it?

208
00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:30.506
Mother, actually...

209
00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:37.080
I...

210
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.084
It's really annoying. You're driving me crazy.

211
00:11:41.484 --> 00:11:45.588
I said I would forgive everything. Why are you taking so much time?

212
00:11:45.988 --> 00:11:49.358
As long as you don't have a child with another woman like your father,

213
00:11:49.358 --> 00:11:52.361
I'll understand everything.

214
00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:55.131
I'll forgive you. What is it?

215
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:58.701
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:59.602 --> 00:12:03.906
Actually, Han Gyul is...

217
00:12:05.608 --> 00:12:08.878
Mom, when did you come?

218
00:12:09.378 --> 00:12:11.614
It's been a while since I came here.

219
00:12:11.614 --> 00:12:14.016
What were you doing? Where were you?

220
00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.487
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

221
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.722
Did you come?

222
00:12:21.257 --> 00:12:25.828
You've been through a lot of trouble.

223
00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:30.199
You went through a lot of trouble to make a baby,

224
00:12:30.233 --> 00:12:33.402
raise her,

225
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:38.274
and not let your wife know about this.

226
00:12:38.608 --> 00:12:40.877
You look gaunt.

227
00:12:40.877 --> 00:12:43.246
You must be lacking energy.

228
00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:45.148
I'm okay.

229
00:12:46.215 --> 00:12:49.385
Mom, Mother is sick.

230
00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:50.720
Let's go home.

231
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.189
What are you talking about?

232
00:12:53.322 --> 00:12:56.259
I brought this to give...

233
00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.895
this to your mother-in-law.

234
00:12:58.895 --> 00:13:01.631
It'll make her feel...

235
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:04.400
a little better.

236
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.370
- I'll give this to her. - Mom, please.

237
00:13:09.438 --> 00:13:11.874
Let's just go.

238
00:13:12.475 --> 00:13:14.010
Is the situation not good?

239
00:13:15.244 --> 00:13:16.612
Okay, let's go.

240
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.582
Wait, why did I come here?

241
00:13:20.616 --> 00:13:22.285
You're here to take me home.

242
00:13:22.752 --> 00:13:23.886
Let's go.

243
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:27.256
Something doesn't feel right.

244
00:13:27.356 --> 00:13:28.958
- Let's go. - Okay.

245
00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.862
- It's so late, let me apologize. - Yes.

246
00:13:33.863 --> 00:13:36.032
- I'll see you out. - Okay.

247
00:13:36.032 --> 00:13:37.233
Let's go.

248
00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:48.377
What are you going to do?

249
00:13:49.478 --> 00:13:51.614
Do you also want her to faint?

250
00:13:52.648 --> 00:13:56.319
I'll tell her myself. Just don't say anything.

251
00:14:18.474 --> 00:14:20.509
The people that I hate the most...

252
00:14:20.877 --> 00:14:24.480
are the ones that try to benefit from others' weaknesses.

253
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.388
Chef.

254
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:34.624
Are you okay?

255
00:14:35.825 --> 00:14:38.127
Sometimes, I really hate people.

256
00:14:40.997 --> 00:14:42.398
Don't disappoint me.

257
00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:44.867
Okay.

258
00:14:48.104 --> 00:14:49.338
Let's start the meeting.

259
00:14:52.074 --> 00:14:54.343
Intern, where are you sitting?

260
00:14:54.343 --> 00:14:55.511
You didn't prepare tea.

261
00:14:55.511 --> 00:14:57.346
I'm sorry, I'll do that.

262
00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:05.154
Don't nag her too much.

263
00:15:05.755 --> 00:15:06.956
She'll get fired anyway.

264
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:21.003
Excuse me? Where is the menu development team?

265
00:15:23.239 --> 00:15:24.640
Myung Rang.

266
00:15:25.574 --> 00:15:26.876
Hi, Intern.

267
00:15:27.276 --> 00:15:30.212
How did you come here?

268
00:15:30.212 --> 00:15:32.114
I heard you were going to enlist in the army. What happened?

269
00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:34.116
I quit.

270
00:15:34.617 --> 00:15:36.319
The army won't accept me.

271
00:15:36.485 --> 00:15:38.621
Just because I'm too old.

272
00:15:39.588 --> 00:15:42.358
I knew you would quit soon.

273
00:15:43.326 --> 00:15:44.727
Why are you here?

274
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:46.595
Guess why I'm here.

275
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:51.867
I asked for the interim report for the Christmas promotion until today.

276
00:15:53.903 --> 00:15:55.237
Here it is.

277
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.114
You already completed the recipe.

278
00:16:05.114 --> 00:16:08.584
I already have a couple of hundred recipes for new menus.

279
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:10.753
They all want to leave my head.

280
00:16:10.753 --> 00:16:13.622
All I have to do is choose one.

281
00:16:14.523 --> 00:16:16.158
You're amazing.

282
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.129
He is. I just have a concept.

283
00:16:21.964 --> 00:16:24.834
This is the difference between original and fake.

284
00:16:24.834 --> 00:16:27.870
Original and fake, winner and one who's here through connections.

285
00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.108
Watch and learn from him.

286
00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:37.113
How can the chef and assistant both be so incompetent?

287
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:42.485
Please take that back.

288
00:16:42.852 --> 00:16:44.387
I might be,

289
00:16:44.387 --> 00:16:46.589
- but he isn't. - Intern.

290
00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:50.159
Do you know how much trivial work is left undone from your absence?

291
00:16:51.394 --> 00:16:54.530
Clean up before you start complaining.

292
00:16:59.368 --> 00:17:02.004
I'll clean for you.

293
00:17:02.872 --> 00:17:04.006
Myung Rang.

294
00:17:08.377 --> 00:17:09.612
Nice to meet you.

295
00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:14.150
I'm Lee Myung Rang, the new contract worker.

296
00:17:14.383 --> 00:17:15.618
Nice to meet you.

297
00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.328
I'll help you clean up.

298
00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:27.863
What are you doing?

299
00:17:27.863 --> 00:17:28.964
Let me go.

300
00:17:32.902 --> 00:17:34.136
This way.

301
00:17:35.438 --> 00:17:36.605
Oh, my.

302
00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:38.441
Wait for me.

303
00:17:40.409 --> 00:17:42.611
Is this a neighborhood meeting?

304
00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.046
They seem to travel in packs.

305
00:17:53.923 --> 00:17:55.391
Try it, and tell me how it is.

306
00:17:56.792 --> 00:17:58.294
Why are we here?

307
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:01.397
We need to work hard since Manager Joo doesn't like us.

308
00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:03.933
Eating is important.

309
00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.869
We need to eat, even if they call us fake and unworthy.

310
00:18:12.641 --> 00:18:13.776
Here.

311
00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:24.787
It tastes a little different.

312
00:18:25.387 --> 00:18:27.623
It's really tender for pork.

313
00:18:27.656 --> 00:18:29.825
Is the meat cured?

314
00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:33.295
You really have absolute taste.

315
00:18:33.929 --> 00:18:37.399
It's not cured, but it's cooked it in a special way.

316
00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:40.469
I didn't know that it could taste so different.

317
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.638
It's delicious.

318
00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.208
Look who's here.

319
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:54.817
It's been a long time.

320
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:00.422
Who is she?

321
00:19:03.826 --> 00:19:05.161
Don't jump to conclusions.

322
00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:08.430
How is the meat?

323
00:19:10.699 --> 00:19:11.867
It's delicious.

324
00:19:12.668 --> 00:19:13.903
Please enjoy.

325
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.805
Chef Jung is our VIP.

326
00:19:20.376 --> 00:19:22.511
I have something to ask you.

327
00:19:22.778 --> 00:19:23.879
Really?

328
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.081
Eat first.

329
00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:37.159
Gosh.

330
00:19:40.896 --> 00:19:42.865
(Forever my love, Tae Yang)

331
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.105
Forever my love, Tae Yang?

332
00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:03.953
Why didn't you eat the meat?

333
00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.120
I'm not hungry.

334
00:20:05.421 --> 00:20:06.488
What's wrong?

335
00:20:06.488 --> 00:20:08.424
You usually finish four servings.

336
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:10.626
When did I finish four servings?

337
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.828
You think I'm a glutton.

338
00:20:13.662 --> 00:20:15.998
Wait. Sit down.

339
00:20:16.432 --> 00:20:17.633
Why are you doing this suddenly?

340
00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:19.101
Why is this so sudden for you?

341
00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:23.639
I don't know why you're doing this, but eat before you leave.

342
00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:24.707
No.

343
00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:28.310
I don't want to eat a single bite with you here.

344
00:20:31.714 --> 00:20:32.848
Chef Jung?

345
00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:38.420
Hello, Chairman.

346
00:20:40.389 --> 00:20:42.358
Do you know this place too?

347
00:20:42.524 --> 00:20:44.193
Yes, a little.

348
00:20:46.061 --> 00:20:48.430
Excuse me, but we must leave first.

349
00:20:53.302 --> 00:20:54.803
Have a nice meal.

350
00:20:57.906 --> 00:20:58.974
Thanks for the meal.

351
00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:05.948
You must know him well.

352
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:09.918
Of course. I know him well.

353
00:21:14.957 --> 00:21:16.592
(New York Sous Vide Steak)

354
00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:19.128
What's New York Sous Vide Steak?

355
00:21:19.128 --> 00:21:22.531
It's a luxurious menu that will enhance the level of our restaurant.

356
00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:25.634
We'll use Korean beef that has the best flavor among beefs...

357
00:21:25.634 --> 00:21:27.870
from the healthiest female cows,

358
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.672
and cure them using the sous vide method...

359
00:21:29.672 --> 00:21:33.342
This isn't a French restaurant. It's a family restaurant.

360
00:21:33.776 --> 00:21:36.011
We can't afford the expensive ingredients.

361
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:38.013
If we double the customers and sell it with...

362
00:21:38.013 --> 00:21:39.181
a low-price high-volume policy.

363
00:21:39.181 --> 00:21:41.116
Do I even have to care about management now?

364
00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:44.019
Chef No,

365
00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.822
do you think this could get selected as the new menu?

366
00:21:50.125 --> 00:21:52.194
You should take a look at Chef Jung's and prepare.

367
00:21:53.362 --> 00:21:55.431
Why are you giving this to me?

368
00:21:56.632 --> 00:22:00.469
Sometimes the imitations are better than the original.

369
00:22:01.337 --> 00:22:02.738
Copy this word for word.

370
00:22:03.439 --> 00:22:04.807
What are you going to do?

371
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.842
Just do as I tell you.

372
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.946
I'll take care of the rest.

373
00:22:18.387 --> 00:22:21.123
You told me you know Jung Tae Yang very well.

374
00:22:21.123 --> 00:22:22.791
How did you meet him?

375
00:22:22.791 --> 00:22:24.059
He saved my life.

376
00:22:24.793 --> 00:22:28.197
He saved my restaurant by developing this menu.

377
00:22:28.197 --> 00:22:29.264
Really?

378
00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:32.601
He taught us how to cure the meat and made it cost-effective.

379
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:34.970
Thanks to him, our profit doubled,

380
00:22:35.104 --> 00:22:36.739
but he refuses to receive royalties.

381
00:22:36.872 --> 00:22:40.776
So he did everything for free?

382
00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:42.077
Yes.

383
00:22:42.077 --> 00:22:44.613
He's not only a good chef, but also a loyal friend.

384
00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:46.448
He's famous for that among his friends.

385
00:22:47.082 --> 00:22:49.118
He's kind of unique.

386
00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:50.652
Even in a world like this,

387
00:22:50.652 --> 00:22:53.055
he's a person that cares more about friends than money.

388
00:23:02.765 --> 00:23:04.066
Why are you angry?

389
00:23:07.603 --> 00:23:08.670
All right.

390
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:10.606
Then pick.

391
00:23:10.973 --> 00:23:12.775
One, there wasn't enough meat.

392
00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:15.344
Two, the meat was too tough.

393
00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:16.712
Three,

394
00:23:17.045 --> 00:23:19.648
you regret leaving leftovers.

395
00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:21.917
You must think of me as a glutton.

396
00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:25.454
Gosh, that's why. I should've guessed.

397
00:23:28.357 --> 00:23:31.193
You wanted pork more than beef. This is my answer.

398
00:23:35.063 --> 00:23:36.999
What am I to you, Chef?

399
00:23:37.266 --> 00:23:39.067
You're my assistant.

400
00:23:39.468 --> 00:23:40.569
There's one more.

401
00:23:42.471 --> 00:23:44.106
You have absolute taste.

402
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.041
All right.

403
00:23:46.608 --> 00:23:48.010
All right.

404
00:23:48.444 --> 00:23:49.912
I know why you are angry.

405
00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:52.347
It's because of Do Hee.

406
00:23:52.347 --> 00:23:53.849
You dated in the past, didn't you?

407
00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:55.017
How did you know that?

408
00:23:56.118 --> 00:23:57.219
Did it show that much?

409
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:09.565
(Forever my love, Tae Yang)

410
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.836
Am I nothing to you?

411
00:24:14.036 --> 00:24:17.339
How can you take me to a restaurant owned by your ex-girlfriend?

412
00:24:17.406 --> 00:24:20.609
And you hugged her in front of me.

413
00:24:20.609 --> 00:24:22.411
And when she asked us if we're dating,

414
00:24:22.411 --> 00:24:24.680
you told her not to misunderstand and didn't answer properly.

415
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.616
How can you treat me like this?

416
00:24:27.616 --> 00:24:28.617
Lee Ru Ri.

417
00:24:29.585 --> 00:24:31.153
You're so adorable.

418
00:24:31.587 --> 00:24:33.889
What?

419
00:24:34.356 --> 00:24:36.258
Myung Tae was your only boyfriend in the past, wasn't he?

420
00:24:36.859 --> 00:24:39.428
You weren't even dating him for real.

421
00:24:40.262 --> 00:24:42.531
Why are you bringing that up now?

422
00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:46.201
Do you like me so much that you feel jealous?

423
00:24:46.201 --> 00:24:47.302
No!

424
00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.771
Really?

425
00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:52.074
Then why did you get jealous over someone that doesn't matter?

426
00:24:52.074 --> 00:24:53.909
It's not someone that doesn't...

427
00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:57.112
matter?

428
00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.014
Yes.

429
00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:01.717
Do Hee's my friend from elementary school.

430
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.819
She manages the restaurant with her husband,

431
00:25:03.819 --> 00:25:05.687
and I helped her out a little when it didn't go well.

432
00:25:09.091 --> 00:25:10.158
Then...

433
00:25:11.126 --> 00:25:14.463
But did you really have to take me there?

434
00:25:14.463 --> 00:25:15.664
I could have misunderstood the situation.

435
00:25:15.664 --> 00:25:19.468
I took her there because the concept for the new menu is pork neck steak.

436
00:25:20.369 --> 00:25:23.572
First, I went there with you to do some research on sauces.

437
00:25:23.805 --> 00:25:26.441
Second, I talked to her alone...

438
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:28.644
to refuse royalties.

439
00:25:28.911 --> 00:25:30.078
Third,

440
00:25:30.112 --> 00:25:32.447
I didn't tell her about us...

441
00:25:33.882 --> 00:25:35.684
because she'd know just by looking at my eyes...

442
00:25:36.118 --> 00:25:37.219
that I like you.

443
00:25:43.292 --> 00:25:47.262
And just so that you won't misunderstand in the future,

444
00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:51.400
my ex-girlfriends are like the military to me.

445
00:25:52.601 --> 00:25:54.570
They are simply passing memories.

446
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.574
I don't want to go back.

447
00:26:01.677 --> 00:26:02.678
Then...

448
00:26:03.612 --> 00:26:04.780
later...

449
00:26:05.948 --> 00:26:07.049
later,

450
00:26:07.716 --> 00:26:09.284
if we break up,

451
00:26:10.152 --> 00:26:12.020
would I be like military to you?

452
00:26:12.387 --> 00:26:13.488
Why?

453
00:26:14.122 --> 00:26:15.223
Does it scare you?

454
00:26:20.629 --> 00:26:23.432
Sometimes, sometimes,

455
00:26:24.266 --> 00:26:26.335
there are some people that wish to stay...

456
00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:28.770
in the military because they like it so much.

457
00:26:29.938 --> 00:26:31.940
I might become like them too.

458
00:26:38.447 --> 00:26:39.548
Meat.

459
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:42.050
Gosh, the meat.

460
00:26:42.718 --> 00:26:45.220
It's such a waste. We left so much meat.

461
00:26:46.788 --> 00:26:47.823
We should have taken it to go.

462
00:27:08.343 --> 00:27:10.178
He wants to become a beauty consultant.

463
00:27:10.178 --> 00:27:12.948
He wants to teach make-up skills that fit different people.

464
00:27:15.617 --> 00:27:17.586
Goodness, that brat.

465
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.489
Why doesn't he understand his parents?

466
00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:26.461
Woo Joo said he won't go to school starting next week.

467
00:27:27.362 --> 00:27:28.764
What?

468
00:27:28.964 --> 00:27:30.532
Did you just let him?

469
00:27:30.532 --> 00:27:31.800
Of course I did.

470
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.169
He's not a colt. We can't force him.

471
00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.638
I can't live like this. It's suffocating me.

472
00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:39.875
I can't meet Woo Joo and your eyes while living in the same house.

473
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:42.144
We should see an end to this today.

474
00:27:42.144 --> 00:27:44.046
There's no end to this.

475
00:27:44.046 --> 00:27:45.614
Become his bodyguard,

476
00:27:45.614 --> 00:27:48.083
so he won't do anything wrong before he graduates.

477
00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:50.118
We need to go somewhere together.

478
00:27:50.852 --> 00:27:53.321
Make a decision after you've been there.

479
00:27:53.822 --> 00:27:54.956
Get ready.

480
00:27:56.558 --> 00:27:57.926
What are you going to do?

481
00:27:58.026 --> 00:27:59.094
The necklace?

482
00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:00.362
If we give it to her,

483
00:28:00.362 --> 00:28:03.065
she's going to let you register to the academy.

484
00:28:03.065 --> 00:28:06.301
But I don't feel like doing that. Dad hates her so much.

485
00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:08.403
That's exactly why we should do that.

486
00:28:08.403 --> 00:28:11.673
She told us that's the only way for them to get on good terms again.

487
00:28:11.873 --> 00:28:14.643
It's going to be a win-win situation.

488
00:28:14.643 --> 00:28:16.011
I don't know.

489
00:28:16.178 --> 00:28:18.213
Mom didn't like it when we looked at her necklace.

490
00:28:18.213 --> 00:28:19.514
Gosh, you're so frustrating.

491
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.719
Are you going to do it or not?

492
00:28:25.854 --> 00:28:26.922
Eun Byul.

493
00:28:32.861 --> 00:28:36.565
Eun Byul, you've been studying so hard since morning.

494
00:28:36.998 --> 00:28:38.767
You might go to Seoul University.

495
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.136
Dad, don't interrupt me.

496
00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:42.370
All right.

497
00:28:42.738 --> 00:28:44.873
But you can study later.

498
00:28:44.873 --> 00:28:46.108
Let's go out.

499
00:28:46.341 --> 00:28:47.409
Where?

500
00:28:47.409 --> 00:28:50.312
You'll know when you get there.

501
00:28:50.912 --> 00:28:53.648
I'm busy today. I'm going to finish all these problems.

502
00:29:01.223 --> 00:29:04.860
Did you find anything about Jung Hwa Young?

503
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.728
I received some calls from Seattle.

504
00:29:07.295 --> 00:29:09.064
She ran away with a fake identity,

505
00:29:09.064 --> 00:29:11.366
so there was a high possibility she was involved in serious crime.

506
00:29:11.566 --> 00:29:14.436
So he searched Kang Anna's criminal history.

507
00:29:14.436 --> 00:29:16.138
What did he find?

508
00:29:16.138 --> 00:29:18.106
There are three women with the same name.

509
00:29:18.106 --> 00:29:20.709
He's going to track the one that seems most likely to be her.

510
00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:24.379
She must have done something awful.

511
00:29:25.947 --> 00:29:29.417
If Eun Byul brings her ex-husband's photo today,

512
00:29:30.418 --> 00:29:33.188
Jung Hwa Young is not going to be able to do anything.

513
00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:05.921
The lip colors that will be popular this fall...

514
00:30:05.921 --> 00:30:07.889
are burgundy and nude colors.

515
00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:09.591
I'll create a romantic mood...

516
00:30:09.591 --> 00:30:12.027
with this burgundy color.

517
00:30:12.594 --> 00:30:14.863
First, it's important to match the tone of the face.

518
00:30:14.863 --> 00:30:16.198
For her,

519
00:30:16.198 --> 00:30:18.133
- she has a pale face... - What are you doing?

520
00:30:18.533 --> 00:30:21.336
He's Woo Joo's role model.

521
00:30:23.972 --> 00:30:27.409
This year, the burgundy color with a more blackish red color is in trend.

522
00:30:27.609 --> 00:30:29.678
But nude colors...

523
00:30:29.678 --> 00:30:32.814
that help express the face tone naturally will be popular too.

524
00:30:52.968 --> 00:30:54.169
Look at Woo Joo.

525
00:31:02.978 --> 00:31:05.113
Have you seen his eyes glittering like that before?

526
00:31:05.614 --> 00:31:07.349
What about his happy face?

527
00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:13.788
If this is what he truly wants to do,

528
00:31:14.089 --> 00:31:16.892
neither of us have the right to stop him.

529
00:31:49.291 --> 00:31:50.358
I found it.

530
00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:06.574
I found the necklace, Grandma.

531
00:32:07.208 --> 00:32:09.277
Okay. Good job.

532
00:32:09.711 --> 00:32:11.112
Send me a picture of it.

533
00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:15.116
No. I'll go there now. Give me the money for the academy.

534
00:32:16.117 --> 00:32:19.354
Okay. I'll send you the car now.

535
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.498
- Ms. Go Eun Byul? - Yes.

536
00:32:55.123 --> 00:32:56.958
Are we going to the office?

537
00:32:57.659 --> 00:33:00.061
I have to be home soon.

538
00:33:01.129 --> 00:33:03.798
Do you want me to give her the necklace?

539
00:33:03.798 --> 00:33:04.866
No.

540
00:33:05.033 --> 00:33:07.902
It's important. I'm only going to show it to Grandma.

541
00:33:17.545 --> 00:33:19.180
I've thinking about this for so long.

542
00:33:19.381 --> 00:33:21.416
I'm not running away to avoid studying.

543
00:33:24.019 --> 00:33:25.120
Then?

544
00:33:25.887 --> 00:33:27.789
Are you sure about it?

545
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:30.158
I tried to be a tough guy like you wanted,

546
00:33:30.658 --> 00:33:31.659
but I can't do it.

547
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.029
I'm different from other kids.

548
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.298
- Woo Joo. - I'm serious.

549
00:33:37.565 --> 00:33:40.101
I don't want to waste my teenage years sleeping...

550
00:33:41.036 --> 00:33:42.837
through classes that I don't even understand.

551
00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:46.508
What you chase this dream but end up giving up?

552
00:33:46.841 --> 00:33:48.376
What are you going to do then?

553
00:33:48.376 --> 00:33:50.178
Then I'll find another way.

554
00:33:50.178 --> 00:33:53.681
Kim Woo Joo! You're going to ruin your life.

555
00:33:54.015 --> 00:33:55.116
Honey. Hold on.

556
00:33:56.718 --> 00:33:58.353
I think he's right.

557
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.923
We keep making mistakes in our lives too.

558
00:34:02.157 --> 00:34:03.458
It's his life.

559
00:34:04.392 --> 00:34:06.428
We need to help him...

560
00:34:06.428 --> 00:34:08.696
find his own way of life.

561
00:34:09.564 --> 00:34:10.899
Let's register him at the academy.

562
00:34:12.867 --> 00:34:13.968
Dad.

563
00:34:23.411 --> 00:34:27.048
Eun Byul. Did you wait for long?

564
00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:31.386
Sorry. The meeting took longer than I thought.

565
00:34:32.053 --> 00:34:34.589
Why didn't you have the pizza?

566
00:34:36.558 --> 00:34:39.260
I couldn't eat it. I'm scared.

567
00:34:41.362 --> 00:34:43.364
Don't be afraid.

568
00:34:43.531 --> 00:34:45.200
You're not doing anything bad.

569
00:34:45.867 --> 00:34:49.637
I told you. This is to help your big brother.

570
00:34:49.704 --> 00:34:51.339
Take a look at it, and give it back please.

571
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.309
I need to put this back before Mom comes back.

572
00:34:55.143 --> 00:34:57.112
Okay. Show me.

573
00:35:19.968 --> 00:35:23.371
My goodness. This is really old.

574
00:35:43.825 --> 00:35:45.593
You got an urgent call from Seattle.

575
00:35:46.027 --> 00:35:47.262
Really?

576
00:35:48.163 --> 00:35:50.198
Eun Byul. Wait here.

577
00:36:09.284 --> 00:36:10.385
Hey, Woo Joo.

578
00:36:10.451 --> 00:36:12.220
Hey, Sister. Where are you?

579
00:36:12.387 --> 00:36:14.989
What do you think? I'm meeting Grandma.

580
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.824
You showed her already?

581
00:36:16.991 --> 00:36:18.393
No. Not yet.

582
00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:21.596
Don't show Grandma the necklace.

583
00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:22.797
Bring it back now.

584
00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:25.300
Why? You want to register...

585
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.702
Mom said yes. She said she'll register me at the academy.

586
00:36:28.303 --> 00:36:31.739
I felt guilty about it anyway. Let's stop it.

587
00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.208
Bring it back quickly.

588
00:36:36.244 --> 00:36:38.012
Where did she go?

589
00:36:40.915 --> 00:36:42.283
Did she go to the restroom?

590
00:36:48.089 --> 00:36:50.858
Oh, my. Are you okay?

591
00:36:51.226 --> 00:36:52.860
Yes. I'm sorry.

592
00:36:54.596 --> 00:36:57.298
You should watch where you're going, little lady.

593
00:37:00.201 --> 00:37:02.036
What is it? Are you hurt?

594
00:37:03.238 --> 00:37:04.305
What?

595
00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:06.741
Are you okay, kid?

596
00:37:07.809 --> 00:37:09.844
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

597
00:37:19.721 --> 00:37:21.589
Where did I see her?

598
00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:33.167
It's strange. They look the same.

599
00:37:42.343 --> 00:37:44.078
How could this happen?

600
00:37:45.947 --> 00:37:47.148
It went well.

601
00:37:47.148 --> 00:37:48.916
- Good job. - It's nothing.

602
00:37:54.722 --> 00:37:56.557
He knows Grandma too.

603
00:37:57.592 --> 00:37:58.893
Who on earth is he?

604
00:38:07.468 --> 00:38:09.737
Is it delicious, Han Gyul?

605
00:38:12.307 --> 00:38:14.509
Eat a lot. Chew it well.

606
00:38:26.587 --> 00:38:28.756
Han Gyul is my daughter.

607
00:38:45.973 --> 00:38:47.975
Did you scream, Yeon Ju?

608
00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:51.379
The TV's off, but I hear screaming.

609
00:38:53.014 --> 00:38:54.449
No.

610
00:38:54.682 --> 00:38:56.451
Get up, baby.

611
00:38:56.451 --> 00:38:59.687
I made some porridge with mung beans.

612
00:38:59.687 --> 00:39:01.189
Have some.

613
00:39:01.189 --> 00:39:02.490
I don't feel like eating.

614
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.325
I want to be alone, Mom. Just leave.

615
00:39:04.325 --> 00:39:06.527
What's wrong, baby?

616
00:39:06.527 --> 00:39:08.162
Did something happen?

617
00:39:08.162 --> 00:39:10.798
Why are you suffering by yourself?

618
00:39:10.798 --> 00:39:13.267
Did your in-laws say something to you?

619
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:16.337
Tell me.

620
00:39:16.471 --> 00:39:19.307
I'm a problem solver.

621
00:39:19.574 --> 00:39:22.577
I'll settle it for you. Tell me. What is it?

622
00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:26.280
- Mom. - Yes.

623
00:39:28.716 --> 00:39:30.718
You know my youngest sister-in-law?

624
00:39:31.319 --> 00:39:32.453
Yes.

625
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.322
Should I raise her?

626
00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:39.727
What in the world are you talking about?

627
00:39:39.861 --> 00:39:43.598
He must've gone crazy.

628
00:39:43.664 --> 00:39:45.767
Did he convince you...

629
00:39:45.767 --> 00:39:48.836
to raise his half-sister?

630
00:39:49.036 --> 00:39:52.573
Now that he's taking us...

631
00:39:52.573 --> 00:39:54.475
for granted,

632
00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:56.844
he wants more?

633
00:39:56.844 --> 00:39:58.646
Mom. That's not it.

634
00:39:58.646 --> 00:40:00.415
What is it then?

635
00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:04.218
If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck.

636
00:40:04.452 --> 00:40:08.222
That ungrateful jerk. I need to set him straight.

637
00:40:08.222 --> 00:40:10.758
I'm going to teach him a lesson. Don't stop me.

638
00:40:10.858 --> 00:40:13.394
- Mom. Please. - Let go of me.

639
00:40:13.394 --> 00:40:16.798
- Don't stop me. - You're driving me crazy.

640
00:40:16.798 --> 00:40:19.200
Oh, my goodness.

641
00:40:36.818 --> 00:40:38.186
Hello?

642
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.189
Did you eat?

643
00:40:42.757 --> 00:40:44.659
I'm not feeling well.

644
00:40:45.159 --> 00:40:46.727
Just tell me the reason you called.

645
00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:50.031
Of course, I understand.

646
00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:52.300
You must be upset.

647
00:40:54.202 --> 00:40:56.571
That's why I called.

648
00:40:56.971 --> 00:41:01.008
I found out a way to solve your problem.

649
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:03.678
So will you...

650
00:41:04.178 --> 00:41:07.548
meet me at So Won's office?

651
00:41:09.317 --> 00:41:11.552
I can't go out right now.

652
00:41:12.186 --> 00:41:15.122
If you have something to tell me, come to my house.

653
00:41:15.122 --> 00:41:18.893
I can't tell you something that important at your house.

654
00:41:20.127 --> 00:41:22.630
I'll be waiting at his office.

655
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.931
Please come.

656
00:41:24.866 --> 00:41:26.133
See you later.

657
00:41:30.638 --> 00:41:32.240
Darn it.

658
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.977
I even have to take care of my daughter-in-law.

659
00:41:35.977 --> 00:41:37.512
Gosh.

660
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:43.317
Are you going somewhere? I need to talk to you.

661
00:41:44.051 --> 00:41:47.722
Yes, I'm going to solve the problem that you caused.

662
00:41:48.322 --> 00:41:49.590
What are you talking about?

663
00:41:50.324 --> 00:41:53.160
I don't have enough time, so I'm just going to say one thing.

664
00:41:53.594 --> 00:41:55.296
If something happens...

665
00:41:55.796 --> 00:41:58.432
to So Won's marriage life because of you,

666
00:41:58.432 --> 00:42:00.568
it's all because of you. All right?

667
00:42:00.968 --> 00:42:02.036
Gosh.

668
00:42:03.137 --> 00:42:06.507
Gosh, in this house,

669
00:42:06.507 --> 00:42:09.911
there's always someone that causes problems and others that solve them.

670
00:42:10.144 --> 00:42:13.180
Without me, nothing will ever get solved.

671
00:42:13.447 --> 00:42:16.551
When I come back, I'm going to scold you.

672
00:42:16.918 --> 00:42:19.220
You should be repenting. All right?

673
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.222
My goodness.

674
00:42:25.092 --> 00:42:26.827
Gosh.

675
00:42:34.201 --> 00:42:35.303
Han Gyul,

676
00:42:35.836 --> 00:42:37.638
do you want to go somewhere with Grandmother?

677
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.511
Okay. You need to be presentable, so let's wash your face first.

678
00:42:48.683 --> 00:42:50.117
Did you call her?

679
00:42:50.618 --> 00:42:52.219
What are you going to say now?

680
00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.989
What do you mean?

681
00:42:54.989 --> 00:42:56.824
It's for both of your sakes.

682
00:42:58.492 --> 00:42:59.527
Let's see.

683
00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:02.396
First, Yeon Ju,

684
00:43:03.297 --> 00:43:06.467
what do you think? Just tell me everything.

685
00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:09.070
I can't think straight right now.

686
00:43:10.571 --> 00:43:11.572
It's just...

687
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.508
I cry all the time.

688
00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:19.513
It feels like there's a stone pressuring me in my heart.

689
00:43:21.682 --> 00:43:23.284
It hurts so much.

690
00:43:26.988 --> 00:43:30.057
It's so humiliating, so I can't tell anyone about this.

691
00:43:31.559 --> 00:43:33.260
When I try to get to sleep,

692
00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:35.663
I feel so angry...

693
00:43:36.998 --> 00:43:39.634
and I want to run outside.

694
00:43:40.134 --> 00:43:41.369
I don't have any excuses.

695
00:43:43.471 --> 00:43:46.240
Whatever you choose to do, I'll respect your decision.

696
00:43:47.842 --> 00:43:50.411
You're going to pass me the responsibility now?

697
00:43:50.411 --> 00:43:51.746
It's not like that.

698
00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:54.181
I want to make sure you get what you want.

699
00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:57.818
Then is that true?

700
00:43:58.686 --> 00:44:00.688
Like what Father said,

701
00:44:00.821 --> 00:44:03.591
is it true you had no idea about Han Gyul?

702
00:44:04.592 --> 00:44:05.760
It's the truth.

703
00:44:07.395 --> 00:44:09.163
After I left her mother,

704
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.365
I never contacted her.

705
00:44:11.365 --> 00:44:14.535
I know for a fact that that's true.

706
00:44:15.703 --> 00:44:17.238
Why did you marry me?

707
00:44:18.372 --> 00:44:20.741
If you had a woman you loved so much,

708
00:44:21.142 --> 00:44:23.911
why did you marry me only six months after breaking up with her?

709
00:44:28.115 --> 00:44:30.618
That's because he loved you.

710
00:44:30.618 --> 00:44:33.087
Please don't interrupt us!

711
00:44:33.587 --> 00:44:34.588
Okay.

712
00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.760
I'll leave. You should continue without me.

713
00:44:48.302 --> 00:44:50.037
Tell me honestly.

714
00:44:51.072 --> 00:44:52.740
It wasn't love, was it?

715
00:44:53.908 --> 00:44:56.911
You chose me because of my mother's money.

716
00:44:58.512 --> 00:45:00.281
That may have been one of the reasons.

717
00:45:01.615 --> 00:45:02.683
You're right.

718
00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:05.786
Like you said, it wasn't love.

719
00:45:06.887 --> 00:45:08.756
But I like the fact that you were bright.

720
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:11.492
I was suffering mentally,

721
00:45:11.492 --> 00:45:13.527
but when I was with you, I could forget about Su Mi.

722
00:45:15.663 --> 00:45:16.897
That's why I chose you.

723
00:45:19.433 --> 00:45:21.068
I knew it.

724
00:45:22.837 --> 00:45:24.739
While I was with you,

725
00:45:25.072 --> 00:45:28.142
I never felt like I was being loved.

726
00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:31.011
Is that why...

727
00:45:31.879 --> 00:45:34.014
Is that why you want me to choose?

728
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:36.050
To you, this is a loveless marriage,

729
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.219
so you don't care if we get divorced?

730
00:45:38.552 --> 00:45:41.589
Are you saying you won't have regrets even if I want a divorce?

731
00:45:42.223 --> 00:45:44.492
Is getting a divorce that easy for you?

732
00:45:46.761 --> 00:45:49.663
I... I...

733
00:45:50.698 --> 00:45:53.801
I'm so afraid that I'll lose you because of Han Gyul.

734
00:45:53.801 --> 00:45:55.636
I can't eat.

735
00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.539
I can't even sleep.

736
00:45:59.306 --> 00:46:02.143
Is that all you have to say to me?

737
00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:22.897
Fine, I understand now.

738
00:46:24.899 --> 00:46:27.468
If you want to get a divorce,

739
00:46:28.569 --> 00:46:29.837
I'll do it for you.

740
00:46:31.071 --> 00:46:34.708
I'm sick of my one-sided love.

741
00:46:36.677 --> 00:46:37.745
All right.

742
00:46:38.512 --> 00:46:42.116
Do whatever you want to do in life.

743
00:46:43.717 --> 00:46:45.486
I'll let you go.

744
00:46:45.586 --> 00:46:47.888
I'm going to let you go.

745
00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.994
Let me go.

746
00:46:55.262 --> 00:46:57.431
Let me go, please.

747
00:46:58.432 --> 00:46:59.567
Let me go.

748
00:47:07.908 --> 00:47:09.109
Hello.

749
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:10.978
- Welcome. - Hello.

750
00:47:10.978 --> 00:47:12.246
Do you need something?

751
00:47:12.246 --> 00:47:15.282
Can you recommend some clothes for my child?

752
00:47:16.217 --> 00:47:19.186
Gosh, she's so pretty. She must take after you.

753
00:47:19.587 --> 00:47:21.322
Really? Does she?

754
00:47:21.322 --> 00:47:23.824
Yes, she has your aura.

755
00:47:25.593 --> 00:47:28.863
Han Gyul, didn't you have something you wanted to buy?

756
00:47:29.163 --> 00:47:30.297
Go on.

757
00:47:30.698 --> 00:47:32.132
Really?

758
00:47:32.433 --> 00:47:33.567
Of course.

759
00:47:46.347 --> 00:47:48.148
Did you want to wear something like that?

760
00:47:50.551 --> 00:47:53.320
All right. I'll buy it for you. Choose something else too.

761
00:47:57.258 --> 00:47:59.093
Did you make a decision?

762
00:47:59.093 --> 00:48:01.028
It's not something we can decide about.

763
00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:02.529
I made a decision.

764
00:48:03.931 --> 00:48:04.932
I...

765
00:48:08.936 --> 00:48:10.938
can't get a divorce with So Won.

766
00:48:11.705 --> 00:48:15.409
I love him too much to get a divorce.

767
00:48:17.778 --> 00:48:18.946
Okay.

768
00:48:19.013 --> 00:48:22.449
Then I'll make things simple for you...

769
00:48:23.117 --> 00:48:24.218
and solve the problem.

770
00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:29.056
Don't think about Han Gyul.

771
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:32.893
Continue living as you did.

772
00:48:34.929 --> 00:48:38.165
That doesn't make sense. How can we not think about Han Gyul?

773
00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:40.868
I'm going to register her as my daughter.

774
00:48:42.703 --> 00:48:44.738
Your mother and I are young.

775
00:48:45.472 --> 00:48:47.408
We'll just think of her as a late child.

776
00:48:48.142 --> 00:48:51.879
So you don't need to mention it to Mrs. Yang.

777
00:48:51.879 --> 00:48:55.115
You don't even need to feel pressured financially or mentally.

778
00:48:55.716 --> 00:48:56.884
Father.

779
00:48:58.185 --> 00:49:00.454
Why? Are you worried about your mom?

780
00:49:00.788 --> 00:49:03.090
Her son is about to get divorced.

781
00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:05.392
She will definitely agree to this.

782
00:49:05.659 --> 00:49:08.762
So from now on, Han Gyul is officially...

783
00:49:08.762 --> 00:49:10.698
your sister.

784
00:49:13.067 --> 00:49:17.204
If you can do that for us, I won't speak a word about this.

785
00:49:18.339 --> 00:49:20.574
Raising Han Gyul is also a problem,

786
00:49:20.574 --> 00:49:23.577
but if Mom finds about this, she won't let us live together.

787
00:49:24.411 --> 00:49:26.013
Thank you, Father.

788
00:49:27.748 --> 00:49:28.782
All right.

789
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.385
I can't do that.

790
00:49:34.388 --> 00:49:38.092
I don't think I can live comfortably if I make you take care of her.

791
00:49:38.892 --> 00:49:41.362
I can't do this to my child and my mother-in-law...

792
00:49:42.029 --> 00:49:43.430
any longer.

793
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:46.967
This is the something I did wrong. I'm going to take responsibility.

794
00:49:46.967 --> 00:49:50.337
So Won! How can you even say that?

795
00:49:50.938 --> 00:49:54.008
That means you're willing to get a divorce from me.

796
00:49:54.308 --> 00:49:55.843
How can you say that?

797
00:49:56.176 --> 00:49:57.277
I'm sorry.

798
00:49:57.978 --> 00:49:59.513
But this is the best I can do.

799
00:50:00.748 --> 00:50:02.316
If your mother disagrees,

800
00:50:02.883 --> 00:50:04.318
I'll persuade her.

801
00:50:04.318 --> 00:50:06.720
She doesn't get persuaded by anyone.

802
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.188
I don't know about anything else,

803
00:50:08.188 --> 00:50:10.724
but she won't yield to this problem.

804
00:50:12.359 --> 00:50:14.228
You're so cruel.

805
00:50:14.762 --> 00:50:16.430
You pity her,

806
00:50:16.663 --> 00:50:19.299
yet you don't care about me.

807
00:50:20.801 --> 00:50:23.637
All right. Do as you want.

808
00:50:24.304 --> 00:50:27.508
Whether you raise the child or not, live as you like.

809
00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:31.879
Yeon Ju.

810
00:50:32.379 --> 00:50:33.447
Hey!

811
00:50:34.782 --> 00:50:37.284
Gosh, you fool.

812
00:50:38.052 --> 00:50:40.220
I'll take care of this situation.

813
00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.789
Just keep your mouth shut.

814
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:43.724
Understand?

815
00:50:45.926 --> 00:50:47.861
Oh, my goodness.

816
00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:58.906
You're so beautiful, princess.

817
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.642
Who bought you this cat?

818
00:51:01.642 --> 00:51:02.910
It's a tiger.

819
00:51:19.993 --> 00:51:23.697
I can tell you remember me from your expression.

820
00:51:24.264 --> 00:51:25.866
Why did you come here?

821
00:51:27.301 --> 00:51:30.037
I don't know what you want,

822
00:51:31.071 --> 00:51:33.340
but I don't want anything to do with your family.

823
00:51:33.807 --> 00:51:35.776
There's nothing I want from you.

824
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:40.614
You still gave birth to a child from our family.

825
00:51:41.548 --> 00:51:43.917
I thought I should see you at least once.

826
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.455
What was in your mind when you did that?

827
00:51:49.656 --> 00:51:53.160
You should've talked to us when you got pregnant.

828
00:51:53.627 --> 00:51:55.529
If you were going to have her without saying anything,

829
00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:57.297
you should've assumed full responsibility.

830
00:51:58.298 --> 00:52:02.469
My family is a mess because of Han Gyul right now.

831
00:52:02.469 --> 00:52:04.738
Are you saying it's all my fault?

832
00:52:05.239 --> 00:52:07.074
Is that why you're here?

833
00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:08.809
Look.

834
00:52:09.676 --> 00:52:12.946
- I'm not here to blame you. - Why didn't you...

835
00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:17.050
treat me nicely in the first place?

836
00:52:17.951 --> 00:52:19.786
When I went to introduce myself,

837
00:52:20.187 --> 00:52:23.157
Father didn't even look at me.

838
00:52:24.224 --> 00:52:27.728
He was smiling, but he rejected me with his whole body.

839
00:52:27.761 --> 00:52:31.698
But you should've never asked for money over pregnancy.

840
00:52:31.932 --> 00:52:33.867
Is that what Father told you?

841
00:52:34.301 --> 00:52:35.836
Sure, I did,

842
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:38.205
but after I went to your house,

843
00:52:38.472 --> 00:52:40.807
Father called me at work three times.

844
00:52:41.909 --> 00:52:45.245
He said he had something to say and wanted to meet behind So Won's back.

845
00:52:46.613 --> 00:52:49.917
I never said yes, but it was obvious.

846
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.321
Leave.

847
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:58.091
I didn't do anything wrong.

848
00:52:58.392 --> 00:53:02.262
If I went to see Father, he would've given me money anyway.

849
00:53:02.696 --> 00:53:05.866
Since that was the case, I simply asked for more,

850
00:53:07.868 --> 00:53:10.938
so I could pay for my dying mom's surgery,

851
00:53:12.072 --> 00:53:15.409
and feed the baby inside me.

852
00:53:16.643 --> 00:53:20.547
Is... Is that so wrong?

853
00:53:20.547 --> 00:53:23.450
If you were going to be so cold, you should've become happy.

854
00:53:23.717 --> 00:53:25.018
Look at you now.

855
00:53:25.719 --> 00:53:27.621
Don't you feel ashamed to see your child?

856
00:53:27.788 --> 00:53:30.157
So I'm asking you to raise her.

857
00:53:31.491 --> 00:53:35.529
Pretend I'm dead, and raise her.

858
00:53:35.862 --> 00:53:37.431
Please.

859
00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.783
Children grow up every day.

860
00:53:57.718 --> 00:54:00.220
It'll be the biggest punishment...

861
00:54:01.588 --> 00:54:02.956
for you...

862
00:54:04.558 --> 00:54:06.426
to miss her growing up.

863
00:54:12.432 --> 00:54:14.301
Let's meet again...

864
00:54:15.469 --> 00:54:16.937
after you get released.

865
00:54:41.261 --> 00:54:43.030
Are your legs tired, Han Gyul?

866
00:54:45.699 --> 00:54:48.635
Let's just walk to the cab.

867
00:54:54.341 --> 00:54:55.409
What's wrong?

868
00:55:11.591 --> 00:55:12.726
Han Gyul.

869
00:55:14.027 --> 00:55:15.762
Do you want me to give you a piggyback ride?

870
00:55:16.129 --> 00:55:18.031
Here.

871
00:55:18.865 --> 00:55:21.201
Come on. Here we go.

872
00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:31.678
Is Dad coming home today?

873
00:55:32.279 --> 00:55:33.613
I don't know.

874
00:55:34.014 --> 00:55:35.782
He's busy.

875
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:39.319
I wish he comes home.

876
00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:53.300
Jung Tae Yang's unique.

877
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.837
He's a person that cares more about friends than money.

878
00:56:02.776 --> 00:56:04.177
What's this bracelet?

879
00:56:04.177 --> 00:56:05.946
My mother gave me that bracelet...

880
00:56:06.046 --> 00:56:08.882
saying that it'll protect me wherever I am.

881
00:56:09.449 --> 00:56:13.186
It's my small gift for you to recover fast.

882
00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:32.739
What do you think?

883
00:56:32.839 --> 00:56:34.808
It's too sweet.

884
00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:36.576
I know.

885
00:56:37.077 --> 00:56:40.680
I've been working on it lately, but I can't find the right sauce.

886
00:56:42.382 --> 00:56:44.050
Should I try?

887
00:56:44.217 --> 00:56:45.452
Can you?

888
00:56:45.452 --> 00:56:47.220
You said I have absolute taste.

889
00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.488
Let me try it.

890
00:56:48.488 --> 00:56:50.857
I'll make a few sauces. Just evaluate it.

891
00:56:51.358 --> 00:56:52.459
Okay.

892
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:57.130
Then I'll go look for ingredients. Take care of the sauce please.

893
00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:58.198
Yes.

894
00:56:58.398 --> 00:57:02.569
I'll practice every day after work.

895
00:57:02.736 --> 00:57:04.070
You can't do that alone.

896
00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:07.007
Only the regular employees can stay until late.

897
00:57:07.207 --> 00:57:08.241
Really?

898
00:57:09.409 --> 00:57:11.845
My house is chaotic now.

899
00:57:16.049 --> 00:57:19.119
I'll lend you this. Just don't get caught.

900
00:57:21.221 --> 00:57:23.156
An employee card!

901
00:57:24.057 --> 00:57:25.158
Yes, Chef.

902
00:57:27.928 --> 00:57:29.429
You're still here?

903
00:57:30.497 --> 00:57:31.698
Hello.

904
00:57:32.132 --> 00:57:33.266
Sir.

905
00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:37.637
Will you have a cup of tea with me?

906
00:57:49.282 --> 00:57:53.220
I didn't know my company had such a good view.

907
00:57:56.556 --> 00:57:58.158
Do you come here often?

908
00:57:58.492 --> 00:58:01.528
Yes. I come here often with her...

909
00:58:02.028 --> 00:58:03.530
when I'm out of ideas.

910
00:58:04.197 --> 00:58:05.932
You two must have good harmony.

911
00:58:06.032 --> 00:58:09.536
No. I'm learning a lot from him.

912
00:58:09.636 --> 00:58:12.973
Sure. He has many good qualities.

913
00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.008
He'll be a good teacher.

914
00:58:16.343 --> 00:58:17.410
Sir.

915
00:58:18.612 --> 00:58:20.413
I think I misunderstood you.

916
00:58:21.181 --> 00:58:24.818
You even made breakfast for me.

917
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:27.988
Anyway, I'm sorry.

918
00:58:29.956 --> 00:58:31.157
It's fine.

919
00:58:31.858 --> 00:58:33.527
I don't have good memory.

920
00:58:37.097 --> 00:58:40.267
I don't trust people because my life...

921
00:58:40.534 --> 00:58:42.435
was lonely and intense.

922
00:58:44.638 --> 00:58:47.974
I've learned a lot from it too.

923
00:58:49.843 --> 00:58:53.780
It doesn't sound like you when you said you were lonely.

924
00:58:55.749 --> 00:58:59.219
The brighter the light, the darker the shadow.

925
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.556
Call us anytime.

926
00:59:03.089 --> 00:59:05.992
We'll be your friends when you feel lonely.

927
00:59:06.726 --> 00:59:10.163
Sure. I know many interesting places.

928
00:59:10.196 --> 00:59:11.531
Karaoke is good too.

929
00:59:11.531 --> 00:59:14.167
There's a claw machine down here, and bowling too.

930
00:59:16.136 --> 00:59:19.806
I'm not sure if you want me to join you or pay for you,

931
00:59:20.307 --> 00:59:22.242
but sure.

932
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:24.644
- Sure. - Sure.

933
00:59:32.819 --> 00:59:33.954
Really?

934
00:59:34.321 --> 00:59:35.589
Yes.

935
00:59:35.622 --> 00:59:38.658
He looks a lot older than the picture, but he looks the same.

936
00:59:38.658 --> 00:59:40.627
How is that possible?

937
00:59:40.627 --> 00:59:42.862
He looked so wealthy.

938
00:59:42.862 --> 00:59:44.698
His outfit was neat and sophisticated.

939
00:59:45.432 --> 00:59:46.766
I wonder what he does.

940
00:59:46.766 --> 00:59:49.469
I'm not sure, but he knows Grandma.

941
00:59:49.869 --> 00:59:53.406
I sneaked up behind me. He went into the restaurant to talk to Grandma.

942
00:59:53.506 --> 00:59:55.709
Is he a regular customer then?

943
00:59:55.709 --> 00:59:56.843
I don't know.

944
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:59.245
Anyway, I was shocked.

945
00:59:59.679 --> 01:00:03.717
If he's really Tae Yang's father, they could meet each other.

946
01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:07.487
Right. He goes to the restaurant where Tae Yang works.

947
01:00:07.721 --> 01:00:09.089
I'm nervous.

948
01:00:11.057 --> 01:00:14.160
Wait. Tae Yang doesn't know his father's face.

949
01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.629
He wouldn't recognize him.

950
01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:16.997
Right.

951
01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:22.435
He's such a cool man. Why does Mom never talk about him?

952
01:00:25.639 --> 01:00:28.642
Let's find it out.

953
01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:37.951
Autumn gizzards taste the best.

954
01:00:38.184 --> 01:00:40.487
They say that daughter-in-laws that ran away from home...

955
01:00:40.487 --> 01:00:43.823
come back home prepared for death by stoning.

956
01:00:43.823 --> 01:00:44.991
Eat up.

957
01:00:58.838 --> 01:01:01.141
What's wrong?

958
01:01:01.975 --> 01:01:05.412
You were so in love with your husband.

959
01:01:05.845 --> 01:01:07.947
Did you fight?

960
01:01:07.947 --> 01:01:10.450
I don't want to eat. Excuse me.

961
01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:18.591
You're so stubborn.

962
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:21.094
I can forgive anything,

963
01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:23.396
but I can't have you bring someone else's child.

964
01:01:23.396 --> 01:01:26.299
Her father is alive and well.

965
01:01:26.299 --> 01:01:28.968
Why do you act up and insist you raise her?

966
01:01:28.968 --> 01:01:32.138
Why do you keep saying that nonsense?

967
01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.240
You reap what you sow.

968
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.842
Your father is responsible.

969
01:01:35.842 --> 01:01:38.244
You should just leave him to it.

970
01:01:38.411 --> 01:01:41.181
- Mother. - Stop.

971
01:01:41.848 --> 01:01:44.050
You should comfort Yeon Ju.

972
01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:47.487
Go to her bazaar, and spend a lot of money.

973
01:01:47.487 --> 01:01:51.591
That's your responsibility as a human being.

974
01:01:51.591 --> 01:01:54.627
Don't even think about raising your half-sister.

975
01:01:54.627 --> 01:01:56.029
Do you understand?

976
01:02:05.705 --> 01:02:08.608
Han Gyul, let's wash your face.

977
01:02:14.347 --> 01:02:16.716
What is it? What were you looking at?

978
01:02:19.786 --> 01:02:22.388
It's all right. Just show me.

979
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:37.470
Do you miss your dad?

980
01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:40.840
When will I see him again?

981
01:02:42.709 --> 01:02:43.843
Well.

982
01:02:45.145 --> 01:02:47.046
Who can stop blood relations?

983
01:02:51.818 --> 01:02:53.386
Let's finish this today.

984
01:02:54.387 --> 01:02:56.489
Welcome.

985
01:02:56.489 --> 01:02:58.591
Your building's price has increased.

986
01:02:58.591 --> 01:03:00.260
- Yes. - Go in and buy something.

987
01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.528
- Go in and buy something good. - All right.

988
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:03.196
- Go in. - Thank you.

989
01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.765
- Hi. - Mrs. Yang.

990
01:03:05.765 --> 01:03:07.467
Welcome.

991
01:03:07.467 --> 01:03:09.536
This is at a different level.

992
01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:11.638
It's not easy to become a chairwoman like me.

993
01:03:11.638 --> 01:03:14.641
You've always been generous. Go inside, and buy something.

994
01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:16.242
- Go in, and buy something. - All right.

995
01:03:16.242 --> 01:03:17.510
All right.

996
01:03:38.865 --> 01:03:40.967
(Man Who Sets the Table)

997
01:03:41.201 --> 01:03:42.702
I'm not going to divorce him,

998
01:03:42.702 --> 01:03:44.437
nor am I going to raise her.

999
01:03:44.637 --> 01:03:46.139
Where did she go?

1000
01:03:46.139 --> 01:03:47.740
Han Gyul. Han Gyul!

1001
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.676
I can't calm down, can I?

1002
01:03:49.676 --> 01:03:51.611
What are you hiding from me?

1003
01:03:51.611 --> 01:03:53.913
Tell me the truth. Right now.

1004
01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:54.948
That child...

1005
01:03:55.615 --> 01:03:56.950
is my daughter.
