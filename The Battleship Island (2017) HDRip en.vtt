Hwang Jeong Min

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.458
Seo Ji Seob

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.504
Song Jong Ki

4
00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.515
Lee Jeong Hyeon Kim Su Ahn

5
00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:43.394
Hey get out!

6
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.295
Hurry up the road!

7
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.241
Keep straight ahead!

8
00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.377
Follow it!

9
00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:32.417
Hey! We need to get out of here quickly!

10
00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:36.216
So with that right work!

11
00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.291
Do not do strange
things, work fast!

12
00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.257
Quick work!

13
00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:08.386
Help me! Help me!

14
00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.415
Hey stupid!

15
00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.518
do not interfere!

16
00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:54.495
Forgive me. I can not
protect our team.

17
00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:05.504
You are also working fast.
NeXT time, be more careful.

18
00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.304
Even though the teacher does not like
it, we will continue to do it again.

19
00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:14.446
do not be told by me, do it because
your heart is telling him.

20
00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:17.250
then everything will be perfect.

21
00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:21.257
though I know it's very difficult

22
00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:22.453
let's get started.

23
00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.369
hyung will definitely
come with us right?

24
00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:38.367
until here you remember what the
teacher talked about right?

25
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.339
if you are gone, i will go.

26
00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.284
the time began. let's go.

27
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:49.319
Go.

28
00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.378
Be careful, ok.

29
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:55.450
who will go is a problem
not important. the most important is
how can you go.

30
00:04:56.462 --> 00:05:00.330
this place is very risky to leave.

31
00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:04.395
if you can go once from here,

32
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.233
then you will be free.

33
00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:13.309
if you get caught with a nagasaki
officer, you will not survive.

34
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.282
You must be safe. we must
be free from here alive.

35
00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:42.466
Hey who's that ?!

36
00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:44.434
What are you doing there?

37
00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.480
hyung says we should be safe!

38
00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:10.299
Let's get going.

39
00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:13.300
We'll go!

40
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.327
Yamada, these days
are hard to find.

41
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:41.493
these few days korean people are very
annoying, do we shoot and turn them off?

42
00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:25.367
Battleship Island

43
00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:31.477
Do not rush away. You're handsome
today, no need to go home.

44
00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:33.218
not because of that.

45
00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:34.445
Noisy here.

46
00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:40.257
you do not know who
wants to see you.

47
00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:43.351
this country also knows that
you are the best student

48
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.522
Then if I'm the best student then
lady, want me sold to japan so?

49
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.234
we still have a chance.

50
00:07:51.304 --> 00:08:01.339
I think I'm talking the wrong way, anyway
there are people who want learners like you.
It's stupid of me.

51
00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:04.440
Sir, sir!

52
00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.512
How long will you
be at this party?

53
00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:10.253
the children there do not
really like this party.

54
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:14.282
can not we just
leave them alone?

55
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.290
Why?

56
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:19.431
You know who's gonna catch them?

57
00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.433
my goodness, who did you mean?

58
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:25.460
they are just plain kids
who do not know anything.

59
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.497
we have to sing for a
while first tonight.

60
00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:31.375
so want it?

61
00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:34.242
You know why I like
party so much?

62
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:37.381
I understand.

63
00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:30.302
Oh you're here.

64
00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.266
you should go inside.

65
00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:35.307
I must hurry back.
quickly tell me your business.

66
00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:37.467
Why? Why? have you found it?

67
00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:42.305
hey fool, if I've found it
I'll have told it to my wife.

68
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.483
hey, let's go!

69
00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:38.337
What do you want now?

70
00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:42.406
of course i like my wife,

71
00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:45.444
but you think it's easy
to earn that much money?

72
00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:49.378
You think it's easy to get
that kind of money so much?

73
00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:51.473
still mending no money to eat.

74
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:55.350
then you will work with
your son forever like this?

75
00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.414
I do not hire him by force!

76
00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:09.232
You know it's not like
not to have a wife how?

77
00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:11.327
the other is easier to get a wife

78
00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:23.441
have you prepared it?

79
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.323
this.

80
00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.388
do not like to hire your own children

81
00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:41.324
your child will probably get
traumatized in his old age.

82
00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:45.427
you know even though I
never force you like that.

83
00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:50.364
I know which limitations
take him away to work.

84
00:11:52.378 --> 00:12:01.514
hey listen, if your son is caught by japanese
he can be dragged and carried by them.

85
00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:08.420
You have to be careful
and do not do it often.

86
00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:13.331
I hear you really want to japan huh?

87
00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.366
this is one of my
ways to escape.

88
00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:30.472
I say again to bring your son and
Yourself to Japan is an easy matter
if you have money.

89
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.312
Do I also have to believe you?

90
00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:42.324
quickly finish it!

91
00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:01.246
my goodness, you can throw
up in a moment like this.

92
00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:04.282
basic troublesome. making
odors and bad for everyone.

93
00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:12.449
I told you I could not get on the boat,
but you insisted me to keep going up.

94
00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:15.392
now you blame me.

95
00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:20.261
I'm okay. because want how
else place like this.

96
00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:23.459
Oh my goodness I just wanted
the chapter to continue.

97
00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:26.463
are you someone I know?

98
00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:28.365
I'm just a regular student.

99
00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:31.400
that's a danger. can only
internal people enter.

100
00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:35.470
right, unless you have friends
inside the internals might help.

101
00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:41.410
Do you know where this ship is going?

102
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:49.326
Of course. what do you think
these kids brought here for?

103
00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:56.423
when everyone goes, we
have to catch it yes.

104
00:13:56.535 --> 00:14:00.301
you follow me alone yes. fast.

105
00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:10.247
this is our money

106
00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:15.479
You have to take it yes.

107
00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:25.395
father, where are we going?

108
00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:28.261
what are they doing?
it's important that you follow my father.

109
00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:31.358
it's safe.

110
00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:35.305
is fighting is not it?

111
00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:38.305
is it korea or japanese?

112
00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:43.279
whether it's japanese or korean
but he fights pretty well.

113
00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:53.448
What is this?

114
00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:11.365
Once again you are fuss,
you will all kill me.

115
00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:14.241
What the hell is this jerk talking about?

116
00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:15.439
HEY!

117
00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:18.373
here nobody dare
fight it with me ?!

118
00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:21.515
if you want to fight,
you're on your own.

119
00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:24.415
do not have to involve us.

120
00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:28.459
sorry, but do you
know what justice is?

121
00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:31.360
do you think doing such
a fuss thing is fair?

122
00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.259
see?!

123
00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:34.526
You are basic yes!

124
00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:39.328
do not pretend like thugs here.

125
00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:44.468
Why? because what you do
makes everyone here will die

126
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.302
Wait!

127
00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:48.437
Do not fight!

128
00:15:50.482 --> 00:15:53.280
Okay, I understand

129
00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:55.479
you also sit down. I say sit down!

130
00:15:57.523 --> 00:16:00.492
Your arrogance is that weak

131
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.423
I think you dare to die alone

132
00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:09.298
my goodness, she must be
embarrassed to lose to women

133
00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:13.462
once we fight, and they
know we're going to run out

134
00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:16.398
once they catch us,
we will be finished.

135
00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:41.363
You must follow the father
properly, do not let ya off.

136
00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:43.492
You must follow him yes.

137
00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:46.362
you too, do not have to be safe.

138
00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:48.235
we must endure to the end.

139
00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:50.206
hey hold this.

140
00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:51.467

144
00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.259
Want to meet with shimura? / Yes, yes.

145

172
00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:28.509
I'm here to meet someone.

173
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.482
I'm not an ordinary person.

174

191
00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:19.397

thank you for holding a simple
music show here./ Yeah!

193
00:24:24.496 --> 00:24:25.360
Thank you very much!

194
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.455
my name is lee kang ok.

195
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.434
forgive me, forgive me.

196
00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:38.205
I am chairman of leadership here, I
will be responsible to you guys.

197
00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:43.370
everything will work looking
for pebbles and gems here.

198
00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:48.215
all of which are useful for
building state infrastructure.

199
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.280
so everything has to work hard.

200
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.258
practice right.

201
00:24:56.328 --> 00:25:01.231
we have prepared the
right clothes for you.

202
00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:07.364
if you can get a quality stone,
you can be free from here.

203
00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:11.436
do not try to run away.

204
00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:16.407
who gets caught is about to be killed.

205
00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:17.470
understand?

206
00:25:18.283 --> 00:25:23.414
everything here will be
treated as fairly as possible

207
00:25:24.489 --> 00:25:30.291
everything here should
be able to find gems

208
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:35.227
Go, hurry!

209
00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:44.501
Go, hurry!

210
00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:49.309
I do not think this
way we should be.

211
00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:53.350
I think there's something wrong
with that ship's destination

212
00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:55.443
I think we should get
away from here soon

213
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.320
if like this I feel like
being taken hostage

214
00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:19.410
everything here should be
respectful to the Japanese flag

215
00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:26.241
now you are part of our people

216

229
00:28:01.413 --> 00:28:07.249

try to get a useful stone

230
00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:10.253
after that you will we release

231
00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:15.288

238
00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:04.434

everything here is lied to.

249
00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:57.318
I'm sick of that guy.

250
00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:58.384
this guy loves to hit us all

251
00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:09.239
I'm sick of that guy. this
guy loves to hit us all.

252
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.307
if you combine me

253
00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:15.335
I will rebel and kill him

254
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.415
if you combine me
with this all then,

255
00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:25.252

260
00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:49.403

defending this guy?

268
00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:46.297
We will see. we all here
have turned into slaves

269
00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:50.267

and on the neXT occasion
I will not be told to.

271
00:32:58.409 --> 00:33:00.400
what are you talking about?

272
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:15.225

is called a slave?

273
00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:31.432

305
00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.376
You've been working in America for a long time

306
00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:03.442
I already understand all

307
00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:08.253
I hear you're good in America too

308
00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:13.286
but he's overpaid. / / even so ..

309
00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:14.386
this time you have to be eXTra careful.

310
00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:19.402
do you remember the island where the
Korean people hostage in our sea by japan?

311
00:37:19.503 --> 00:37:24.440
there america managed to
launch bomb and destroy japan

312
00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:30.469
if we bomb the island, there might
be the only way we can be free

313
00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:35.309
but that way, some
korean people can die

314
00:37:35.486 --> 00:37:42.289
You know that this
is your hardest job?

315
00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:49.332
You know what is most
important than independence?

316
00:37:52.403 --> 00:38:00.242
- You must find and
bring it here.

317
00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:06.407
after that we can be independent
and people can live beautifully

318
00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:09.509
if I think about it

319
00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:15.282
now hiroshima and
nagasaki must be pushed

320
00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:18.260
I hope you are not
afraid of this task.

321
00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:29.296
come here, come here.

322
00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:35.310
You know what we
should do today?

323
00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:36.471

without error yes

324
00:38:37.548 --> 00:38:41.416
do not stop smiling and try to
be as friendly as possible.

325
00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:43.242
get ready ..

326
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:49.282
hey, have you eaten yet?

327
00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.393
lazy.

328
00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:54.362
just eat what I give you

329
00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:57.263
who told you not to eat?
fast food.

330
00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:06.376
hey, I'm smuggling this for you

331
00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:10.437
go straight and do not stop

332
00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:14.348
do not stop moving.

333
00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:18.421
damn, just because he beat
me he can replace my post

334
00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:22.424
What are you saying? what do you mean now is
her chair? - do not ask a lot, move fast.

335
00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:28.488
you know once blasted this,
everything will melt and crumble

336
00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:31.360
did not you say it
was just bread?

337
00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:33.361
for me.

338
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.288
wait a minute

339
00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:59.262
what I did was too far

340
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.491
how is it there? / I'm fine!

341
00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:06.236
hey look at me!

342
00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:09.236
so? just keep working!

343
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.309
not only are you hot here

344
00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:15.368
for the welfare and security
of our japanese state

345
00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:18.381
and for the prosperity of
the sale of our produce!

346
00:40:18.482 --> 00:40:25.285
over all the workers
from japan who helped.

347
00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:26.323
toast!

348
00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:01.482
we must take him out.

349
00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:33.415
What is this?

350
00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:54.342
Go, hurry!

351
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:55.503
quick shelter!

352
00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.239
just leave the job, everything
goes out as soon as possible!

353
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.318
Thank you very much

354
00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:14.455
Thank you very much.

355
00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:24.407
how can this happen
a second time ?!

356
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:27.342
You know this place
has so many gems.

357
00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:33.375
for third place can
still be used right?

358
00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.417
he was also devastated

359
00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:47.456
how many victims in second place?
/ about 1100 people.

360
00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.494
and some of them are
alive but trapped

361
00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:53.394
everything is careful out!

362
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:56.337
Let me go! He is my son!

363
00:42:56.507 --> 00:43:00.375
hey, let me go!

364
00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:07.444
so our mining will
be closed again?

365
00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:11.477
we just let that trapped, and
we take again human resources

366
00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:20.320
hey everyone! be careful!

367
00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:22.297
all out of it!

368
00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:29.235
this is the result of research from second place

369
00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:38.281
this time the second mining is being broken
down and soon the island might explode

370
00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:42.246
we must immediately close the
hole and get out of here

371
00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:01.403
hey, work right

372
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:04.498
Hey, you. what are you up for?

373
00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:10.507
what does it mean they
make us work every night?

374
00:44:11.281 --> 00:44:13.476
you know if they can
not work without us?

375
00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:18.445
this seems like the
right time for a duel

376
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.357
Should not we go back?

377
00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:31.529
hey, are we going to be buried here alive? - I do not
know, but we should try to get out as soon as possible

378
00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:33.269
What do you mean?

379
00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:34.496
I know. / What?

380
00:44:35.272 --> 00:44:39.504
we can think of another
way to get out of here

381
00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:41.301
no time to think right?

382
00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:44.379
if we are buried here, the whole
world will not know if we die

383
00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:51.347
hey, I have something
that can be detonated

384
00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:59.485
hey, I think this is a hot
spring that we can not break

385
00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:01.231
if we force, water will
come in and we will drown

386
00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:05.267
why did you break it down?

387
00:45:05.502 --> 00:45:07.402
I understand-I understand

388
00:45:38.502 --> 00:45:40.265
in a minute! / continue!

389
00:45:40.337 --> 00:45:42.430
continue! continue!

390
00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:49.343
Pull!

391
00:46:00.457 --> 00:46:06.453
if you can not fix the mines the two
governments will not pay you down

392
00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:11.267
I will not let the island crumble
like hiroshima and nagasaki

393
00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:15.270
I will try hard to
keep the island safe.

394
00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:17.330
save our citizens and
leave the workers

395
00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:23.277
You think we're there to save human lives?
no, for a profit

396
00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:28.374
I will try to protect
her as much as possible

397
00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:34.382
do you know if mine sales
this month increase more?

398
00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:41.458
then with that I will increase the
worker for the results we get better.

399
00:46:42.266 --> 00:46:45.292
korean girl is pretty, I like

400
00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.336
yes.

401
00:46:46.503 --> 00:46:48.494
waiting until a little
mature might be more fun

402
00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:52.408
there is still a living left right?

403
00:46:55.379 --> 00:46:57.313
Get out of you! Exit!

404
00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:04.444
today is the day of our resurrection

405
00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:07.382
we must celebrate with semangta.

406
00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:12.258
if you want to do
it, do it well.

407
00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:15.525
do not just sit back
and say strange things

408
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:20.396
everything is great!

409
00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:26.467
Where are you going?

410
00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:35.418
hey, if you leave this then you will
not be regarded again as chairman

411
00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:41.247
Hey.

412
00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.476
this guy is crazy! help me!

413
00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:12.279
just shut up!

414
00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:16.292
what's your problem?

415
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.419
just follow me!

416
00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:21.294
hey stop, she's a woman!

417
00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:44.411
do you mean you used to be a Japanese
spy pretending to infiltrate America?

418
00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:47.355
you also know if this is a danger however

419
00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:50.291
I think by doing
this we can be saved

420
00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:53.453
if we are here continuously
with caution nobody will know

421
00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:57.491
after that, we can attack
okinawa using the american plan

422
00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:00.395
then how is the plan?

423
00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:04.406
you know if it is your fault right

424
00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:15.385
I know. but if we do not try it maybe I do not
think there will be a history of korean victory

425
00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:19.482
I could not believe you

426
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:26.320
with this teacher know what to do

427
00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:30.494
when will we start?

428
00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:43.471
I go first

429
00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:45.470
just sit

430
00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:51.282
I said just sit down.

431
00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:52.481
anyway why not

432
00:49:53.457 --> 00:49:58.326
You think by saving me you
can make me like you?

433
00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:00.292
you are crazy

434
00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:06.325
if I wanted to, I
could just do it

435
00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:15.343
they're assholes. sucks

436
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:40.268
first I thought I would not
end up in something like this

437
00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:49.244
what is it, maybe at this moment I
have entered saturated point apda?

438
00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:55.374
whore. Here are just a lot of women
who commit suicide because of them

439
00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:59.322
sometimes even I do not
understand why to do it.

440
00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:07.527
once they free us and
treats us fairly I'm sure
we and they can cooperate with

441
00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:18.237
if we do not want to serve them,
they will surely torture us

442
00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:21.471
everyone knows what
they should do

443
00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:30.411
once not followed, everyone knows
that they will die that day

444
00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:35.389
ah, so like this japanese man.

445
00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:43.227
sometimes I think I should
run away or die here

446
00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:52.373
it hurts when there are
others who do not respect us

447
00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:59.314
it seems to me a bit strange if
I'm not angry and rebellious

448
00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:04.410
I was glad to have done it

449
00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.492
stop dreaming

450
00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:13.386
the important thing can be life, that's all.

451
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:21.496
no one knows the bitterness came

452
00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.469
You can only draw like this?

453
00:53:00.243 --> 00:53:01.505
this drawing needs hard imagination loh

454
00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:04.372
until my stomach ache thinking about it

455
00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:12.211
you paying me with something like this?
I told you not to do strange things.

456
00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:13.380
but still can not be this way

457
00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:19.393
Sir, ask for a cigarette

458
00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:21.363
You know that getting a cigarette is hard right?

459
00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:28.237
I've worked hard and you did not give
me a bit. - Are you working hard?

460
00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:31.239
if it is yes continue to work alone

461
00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:34.334
wait! Wait. I'll
finish it any minute

462
00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:45.254
use this to get a cigarette.

463
00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:54.456
Are you okay?

464
00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:07.310
soo hee!

465
00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:14.249
Why? Why? my goodness./ I'm hurt

466
00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:16.410
wait a minute, please..

467
00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:23.450
odor

468
00:54:43.346 --> 00:54:47.282
I love your son

469
00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:54.390
yamamura likes his
pleasant character

470
00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:56.449
we should do it immediately

471
00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:57.493
- I'm curious too

472
00:54:58.295 --> 00:55:07.465
how can you get
such a sweet girl

473
00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:16.303
how can such a girl really love
and think of you as her father

474
00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:21.377
from now on yamamura

475
00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:27.321
will be my child and my master.

476
00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:34.296
or I will kill him as soon as possible

477
00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:37.227
You have to choose right away

478
00:56:18.441 --> 00:56:20.272
What did you say?

479
00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:27.249
they'll keep an eye on us. /
what do you think I'll do?

480
00:56:28.284 --> 00:56:30.275
this

481
00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:32.218
I hope you succeed

482
00:56:32.522 --> 00:56:35.286
Of course

483
00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:37.349
what is happening right
now I know for sure

484
00:56:38.361 --> 00:56:40.386
what I have said is true

485
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:51.304
I'm not a person you can fool

486
00:56:56.479 --> 00:56:58.242
instead of a plan like this
will be a lot of mistakes?

487
00:56:58.314 --> 00:56:59.372
not so./ i will do it

488
00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.280
Is it true?

489
00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.280
you know soju?

490
00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:12.257
whatever you do we must do

491
00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:16.431
You think running away from this
place is as easy as turning a hand?

492
00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:21.430
know no why are they
holding us here?

493
00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:25.364
do not like to dream

494
00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:30.437
any way we should do

495
00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:35.251
you know the plan will
not work stupid basis

496
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:42.253
do you know what we should do?

497
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:50.365
I'll get you out of here too

498
00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:56.466
maybe we can use this plan

499
00:57:57.373 --> 00:58:03.471
if you do not succeed,
then you will be killed

500
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:07.407
What are you doing?

501
00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:09.452
why do you like to get
together like that?

502
00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:19.427
Where are you going?

503
00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:26.401
you yourself know and realize
that we are good people right?

504
00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:27.470
so you ya the guy?

505
00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:33.339
how can you here?

506
00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:38.280
I do not like them

507
00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:40.509
they are just strange slaves

508
00:58:41.284 --> 00:58:43.309
You stupid!

509
00:58:46.256 --> 00:58:49.384
You know if I and he do like it

510
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.319
come on

511
00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:54.225
thank you

512
00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:09.377
Try to be so and we
must get away soon

513
00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:14.282
if it works you me and my
son we can all go together

514
00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:18.480
You're this .. / Do this plan there
must be a determined determination

515
00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:23.248
You know if what we've done
is going into big plans

516
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:31.291
whoever succeeds or is killed,
are all at equal risk

517
00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:35.265
you are the same

518
00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:41.468
this is too dangerous.
but I will do it

519
00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:46.248
fast!

520
01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.400
Where is he?

521
01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.408
fast exchange position

522
01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.504
hey ready to prepare

523
01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:19.415
wherever we go you have to get ready

524
01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:21.380
never be careless and keep focused

525
01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:25.378
we should look normal

526
01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:27.386
after that we must prepare

527
01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.357
we should also look casual

528
01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.324
do not say that

529
01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:35.490
Thank you very much

530
01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:42.370
I'm sure you need a break

531
01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:43.427
Yes thank you

532
01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:49.402
What are you doing here?
take pains to serve them

533
01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:55.451

534
01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:57.213

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.345
you know our plan

536
01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:06.421
you do it alone

537
01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:12.266
but I will help

538
01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.361
yes god...

539
01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:20.374
you know I'm easy
to get that stuff

540
01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:22.502
you know I'm good at it.

541
01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.340
stop it

542
01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:28.307
correct washing

543
01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.288
my goodness this ornag...

544
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.327
thanks for helping my soo hee

545
01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:16.455
what do you have?

546
01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:26.500
why your face so?

547
01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:29.342
Hey

548
01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:35.315
I'm doing good to ahjumma here

549
01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:40.321
father can not protect you here,
only ahjumma here can do it

550
01:02:41.324 --> 01:02:44.350
Can not I just work
with my father?

551
01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.260
Why? are you bored here?

552
01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:49.456
No, I just do not have friends

553
01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:55.368
onni also do not want to be friends with me.
they are all busy with their respective worlds

554
01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.429
basic evil org2

555
01:02:57.507 --> 01:03:03.343
so I suggest that
you do not do that.

556
01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:07.375
what's wrong with your face?

557
01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:14.279
you know not daddy hard to get food and
trying to bribe ahjumma here just for you.

558
01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:18.284
why daddy scold me?

559
01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:25.493
ah never mind, I do not
understand what else to say

560
01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:36.404
Anyway you have to be patient here so then you can
go with father from here together. understand?

561
01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:41.509
play well./ well!

562
01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:57.390
Thank you very much

563
01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:55.452
plans have accumulated up to 70°/°

564
01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:03.293
we have to recruit it too

565
01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:05.500
hey, hey.

566
01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:11.306
what's wrong? / come with me.
I'll show you something

567
01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:52.278
Why? does not work?

568
01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:56.308
this key really

569
01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:09.483
some are trying to break it down

570
01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:15.395
are you doing this all for
the sake of this paper?

571
01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:19.262
what else do you need in
this world besides that?

572
01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:25.433
I know, but doing so
far I guess excessive

573
01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:30.474
is not it true that
I want to kill you?

574
01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:35.283
and I also will not make
yourself complicated

575
01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:41.485
they really work fast

576
01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:44.258
the war is about to begin

577
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:11.284
perngitana, danger. warning danger.

578
01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:12.320
expected all residents
to occupy their homes

579
01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:20.521
second warning. it is expected that the
entire population will occupy their homes

580
01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:31.439
now is the time

581
01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:34.374
what else will happen to us?

582
01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:42.342
I get this really hard, I think
it's good if I give it to you

583
01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:45.217
want to try?

584
01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.373
come on.

585
01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:28.318
Sir..

586
01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:30.262
time to take medicine.

587
01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:33.490
Sir?

588
01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:45.402
soo hee!

589
01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:52.319
what?

590
01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:55.279
yamamura?

591
01:09:57.259 --> 01:09:58.283
I understand I understand

592
01:09:58.394 --> 01:09:59.452
where is soo hee?

593
01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:01.296
quickly find him

594
01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:05.323
Quickly tell Soo Hee to come out and meet me

595
01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:17.303
where have you been?

596
01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:18.243
hah?

597
01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:22.450
He disappeares

598
01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:27.387
to me, I will respect you

599
01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:31.384
but instead we will go where?

600
01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:36.294
at this moment, wherever
the goal is not important

601
01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:41.299
an important teacher survived

602
01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:46.372
I managed to open the safe
and get the important files

603
01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:56.282
so with this I think it will make it
easier for us to get away from here soon

604
01:10:56.452 --> 01:11:04.450
I know if he does a lot
of corruption everywhere

605
01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.327
is that enough?

606
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:15.336
I know if he does a lot of
corruption, but I think

607
01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:22.377
he's killed somebody, too. - the incident was
covered up because he had not taken office then

608
01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:26.508
but this evidence can knock it down

609
01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:31.379
so far, I do not even
think it will be this way

610
01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:36.356
and also the teacher
knows I'm not kidding

611
01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:39.289
Who are you so?

612
01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:45.257
I never once doubted you

613
01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:53.273
then why is your name on this list?

614
01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:54.400
try deh thinking

615
01:11:56.345 --> 01:12:01.339
what teachers think we support
you do not know your tricks?

616
01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.417
at that moment I thought, you are my friend

617
01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:10.221
he is the one sought everywhere

618
01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:13.295
I have to catch him anyway

619
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.456
can you trust me?

620
01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:20.459
Just stop it here

621
01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:23.334
do I look easy on you?
/ Park Moo Young!

622
01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:26.498
do you know how many orgs
if you try to do it?

623
01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:32.245
from now on I will not
be afraid of you anymore

624
01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:36.250
You think I can not kill you, you're wrong.
- If you kill me then what? do it!

625
01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:41.256
do you think I did it
without thinking first?

626
01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:44.321
Why?

627
01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:45.415
I'm guessing

628
01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:50.354
which I guess is right now

629
01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:51.490
that you are the one who planned it all

630
01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:59.238
do you think I am
doing this to you?

631
01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:04.209
from now on ..

632
01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:06.339
will die before you

633
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:12.252
are you still busy fussing
when we want to escape?

634
01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:15.290
You think I'm stupid? I can just kill you.
- stay there!

635
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.383
from now on listen to my words

636
01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:21.395
from now on japan will not
catch any more korean org

637
01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:27.299
but he's after the little boy, your son./
do not change the subject or I kill you.

638
01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:28.336
What do you mean?

639
01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:33.469
soo hee dad will protect you, if anything
happens you just leave ya and leave father ya

640
01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:35.471

641
01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.473
you two are really

642
01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.314
so how long does this end?

643
01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:41.371

644
01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:44.319

646
01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:47.512
why do you interfere?

647
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:49.257
lower your weapons

648
01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:52.293

Are you okay?

Is anyone hurt?

674
01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:32.439

675

676
01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:39.249

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:43.323

678
01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.227

685
01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:06.271
hey, hey.

686
01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:09.238
what kang woo killed?

687
01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:14.347
we do not know which kang woo is
because their faces are all broken

688
01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:33.393
father did not know what it was

689
01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:46.312
why did you give me a beer?

690
01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:56.389
free our country!

691
01:19:57.292 --> 01:20:00.386
free our country!

692
01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:04.456
free our country!

693
01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:08.492
free our country!

694
01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:10.498
is everything all right?

695
01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:18.506
Do not you know what the hell
is going on outside now ?!

696
01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:22.350
everything here is
also being cleaned up

697
01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:23.441
Are you cleaning up?

698
01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:30.515
we are cornered and the workers become more daring.
we must escape if we will not be killed

699
01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:34.421
and again after what we
do with their women.

700
01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:44.365
they must be grudge with us

701
01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:51.267
we..

702
01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:54.442
What to do?

703
01:20:54.549 --> 01:21:03.389
what we do is run away and
go quietly from this island

704
01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:09.260
so maybe we can still
drown this island

705
01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:15.395
so you and the government
plan to sink this island?

706
01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:19.462
because there is no other
choice, so this is the best way

707
01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:21.502
Is not it?

708
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:27.270
we should see shimura first

709
01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:32.252
shimura might help

710
01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:37.448
free our country!

711
01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:54.366
here you are. bitch.

712
01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:01.482
it's all ruined by you!

713
01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.421
badly injured huh?

714
01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:30.276
burn all the bodies found

715
01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:33.212
lest there be anything left.

716
01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:36.443
when did you become
so cruel to us?

717
01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:41.348
when have we ever defied you?
Why are you so mean to us!?!

718
01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:49.390
after the fire and shimura died, we
more easily acquire the government

719
01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:05.403
wear this shirt first

720
01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.415
if your wound is dry bandage only.
that's all I can do

721
01:23:17.258 --> 01:23:19.419
everything is according to plan?

722
01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:24.396
his son shimura also sudha we kill

723
01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:27.332
well understood

724
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:32.270
nothing else left

725
01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:49.323
soo hee

726
01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:51.280
soo hee

727
01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.350
you live? - Of course we live

728
01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:56.259
we finally get to meet and talk

729
01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:59.458
me and soo hee too
difficult to survive here

730
01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:02.266
Here, look at this

731
01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:03.336
are you eating this?

732
01:24:04.305 --> 01:24:06.330
let's go

733
01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:08.467
but we do not know where it is

734
01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:11.303
What? then my money?

735
01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:13.473
all?

736
01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:22.252
what is important? the most
important thing now we are alive

737
01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:28.355
Geez. at least now we
can all come together

738
01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:41.203
thank you for coming.

739
01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:49.216
nothing else can enslave us.

740
01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:53.276
see if he is in charge.

741
01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:58.518
whether to fall
victim to many more?

742
01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:02.491
what to do if it will
fall victim again?

743
01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:07.462
there is no.

744
01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:10.265
what happens is the opposite

745
01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:24.246
What do you mean? why are you like this ?!

746
01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:37.321
keep quiet and calm yourself

747
01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.265
I really miss playing
on stage with my dad

748
01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:51.502
what was your life with
father so much fun?

749
01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.278
everyone said the food
at the party was good

750
01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:59.282
yes, let's eat roast beef

751
01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:02.379
after that live happily

752
01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.491
why should say
something impossible

753
01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.468
udahlah already.

754
01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:17.371
like a fool

755
01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:22.366
if you go with your uncle right now,
you'll have uncle to buy roast beef

756
01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:27.313
will it happen?

757
01:26:28.249 --> 01:26:29.341
Of course

758
01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:32.479
so soo hee should
help father and uncle

759
01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:39.291
but now, soo hee
should help uncle

760
01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:42.260
can you help uncle right?

761
01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:49.233
do you think with this all
the problems will be solved?

762
01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:55.238
you were involved with him.
I used to help you do it

763
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:58.336
do you think so
you will survive?

764
01:26:58.446 --> 01:27:05.409
do you have any other plans after this?

765
01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:11.254
what's happening to me now is more
than what happened to him first

766
01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.427
I know what to do

767
01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:21.361
which is important no more
rebellion when my plan goes

768
01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:24.369
You mean rebellion?

769
01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:27.340
what would you do if
that happened again?

770
01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:31.401
when it is clear the proof is here

771
01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:35.373
it's the same as a bomb on nagasaki first

772
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:41.389
and I'll probably do it
with a few other tricks

773
01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:52.366
so what are we going to do /
/ we just drown this island

774
01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:54.424
after that we fled and
ducked into japan

775
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:58.498
where did he put it?

776
01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:38.468
You know I'm doing this
to talk to you well

777
01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:44.275
stay bebricara ''sorry sir, I'm wrong.''
like that and you will release me

778
01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:47.287
and just admit that you
always lose with me

779
01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:49.414
You stupid

780
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:52.288
You could die if you
did not follow me

781
01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:55.295
or call me hyung deh

782
01:28:56.497 --> 01:29:01.434
until matipun, even though
you managed to get my body

783
01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:04.396
I will not say it. and you
will chase me to death

784
01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:05.439
you bastard

785
01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:10.402
everything must move forward

786
01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:13.344
everything should never stop working

787
01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:20.479
yamada makes shimura die and he wants
to make all the workers here dead

788
01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:22.483
women included

789
01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:24.349
children too

790
01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:34.425
I ask you for help

791
01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:40.364
if me and soo hee
do not go from here

792
01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:43.433
at least, let my
son go from here

793
01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:52.445
just soo hee might
be easier for you

794
01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:57.483
I'll help

795
01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:04.456
I'll get everyone out of here

796
01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:12.463
everything here
should work regularly

797
01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:23.344
you must obey and not rebel for good
results and you can go home immediately

798
01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:33.384
so from now on I hope
everyone can trust each other

799
01:30:33.494 --> 01:30:35.428
understand all?

800
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:46.206
and when you hear
the gossip here

801
01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:52.371
never trust and ask me first

802
01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:59.385
during which time you will be safe
and everything will be stable

803
01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:04.482
otherwise everything will die

804
01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:11.425
we must try to build
this mine again

805
01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:14.366
we must immediately
build our country agi

806
01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:23.342
once again i say ..

807
01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.280
We certainly can

808
01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:31.316
do not forget to continue
to give thanks to god

809
01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:42.396
if you are grateful then the result will
be good everything will run smoothly

810
01:31:42.463 --> 01:31:49.460
what if we do this together? /

811
01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:51.227
I refuse

812
01:31:52.273 --> 01:31:55.242
nothing is true of his words

813
01:31:55.309 --> 01:31:56.435
everything is dead

814
01:31:56.511 --> 01:32:02.211
you are all lied to by him. the
real yamada was killed by him

815
01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:05.308
do not joke what
I'm doing is right

816
01:32:05.386 --> 01:32:08.446
yesterday the bomb
dropped was an american.

817
01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:15.326
he is the one who told the Americans to
drop the bomb and kill half of our brothers

818
01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:21.233
he is lying and trying
to break us down.

819
01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:27.338
do you want to be in a
sheep like that by him?

820
01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:32.436
if not, for what he heard his speech that even
he himself killed his loyal subordinates to him

821
01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:38.418
everything is fine.

822
01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:40.454
your asshole

823
01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:44.252
You think we do not know your tricks?

824
01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:45.484
everything look well

825
01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:49.457
what you see today
is a fake guise

826
01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:53.366
but .. geez i have to say this

827
01:32:53.467 --> 01:33:00.270
he did not hesitate to kill his
caring and loyal subordinates

828
01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:08.510
and this, you can all
read all the reports here

829
01:33:10.318 --> 01:33:17.383
everything is dead and everything
is lying, it's all your fault!

830
01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:22.361
this guy tried to slander me

831
01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:29.259
all here if you can
prove it./ right!

832
01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:34.270
if he can not prove it means
he is trying to crack us

833
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:37.308
Wait!

834
01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:42.247
what you guys should
do is do it again.

835
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:46.446
why do you guys always slander
an innocent person? / I see it

836
01:33:48.356 --> 01:33:51.484
now only you can kill me

837
01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:53.282
I said I saw it

838
01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:57.353
You killed that
man I saw him too

839
01:33:57.431 --> 01:34:00.298
This time I can not stop it again

840
01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:08.468
Let's talk fine we can solve it./
down if you can prove it

841
01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:10.436
if I show this I can
be told lie too?

842
01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:19.384
this is your shirt torn by him
when begging not to be shot.

843
01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:27.421
all of them do not
affect it./ I see it too

844
01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:29.395
grandfather is a bad person

845
01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:32.330
it seems that many
people see his crime

846
01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.300
I think we should check it out

847
01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.472
my goodness was true

848
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:46.336
why do you do that to us?

849
01:34:46.414 --> 01:34:48.348
everything is silent!

850
01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:54.513
if you want, follow me, if not leave.
/ why you say that easy

851
01:34:55.289 --> 01:35:02.388
Am I wrong to protect all of you?
/ You do it for money

852
01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:05.330
what you do has killed
half the population

853
01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:06.457
do not believe him

854
01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:09.230
Please stop here./
I'll explain first

855
01:35:09.303 --> 01:35:10.497
watch out. you have to trust me

856
01:35:11.305 --> 01:35:12.294
nothing else can protect you

857
01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:17.470
you have to believe before-

858
01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:35.523
then what should we do?

859
01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:41.367
what about membnuh him
we can go from here?

860
01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:46.463
everything should work
with me this time.

861
01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:52.277
if you want, I'll help
you get out of here

862
01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:55.440
what would you do?

863
01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:58.476
where is that person?

864
01:36:00.454 --> 01:36:02.513
Are we really going to go?

865
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:06.384
is not it strange if we
suddenly leave here?

866
01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:07.427
if you do not want to
go ya do not have to go

867
01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:14.457
anyways we bring more than 100 people

868
01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:16.258
How to?

869
01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:21.372
we go with the war

870
01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:24.502
with that, we have to
carry bombs to keep watch

871
01:36:25.412 --> 01:36:27.312
and I'm also a bit confused actually

872
01:36:27.414 --> 01:36:29.507
we have to accept something too

873
01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:33.412
a lot of japanese people here

874
01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:39.281
is not the Japanese
man easily fooled?

875
01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:42.362
stop saying that, and
just follow the rules

876
01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:46.365
what is happening today should
bring us to a better one

877
01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:54.204
You know not if we've had
trouble here all this time?

878
01:36:54.441 --> 01:36:59.242
if you do not want to come ya already do
not join. / who you can talk like that?

879
01:36:59.346 --> 01:37:02.509
You know who I am?

880
01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:07.516
who do you think is overdone here?

881
01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:17.288
after all we will definitely go right?
we will definitely escape.

882
01:37:17.331 --> 01:37:20.323
what father are we just leaving?

883
01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:24.462
you talk a lot

884
01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:30.438
not you guys who want to go

885
01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:34.447
do you think this way we can go?

886
01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:41.319
I also want to live. let's
find our own way out

887
01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:42.514
wait a minute

888
01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:44.449
I also went

889
01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:51.363
without us you can not do it

890
01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:55.299
onni, if we come we
could have been killed

891
01:37:55.536 --> 01:38:00.269
we should try it because
it's our only hope

892
01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:04.435
do you want to get killed?

893
01:38:04.511 --> 01:38:06.411
Sorry!

894
01:38:09.383 --> 01:38:10.315
I want to come too.

895
01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:38.337
Is that what you say?
You have to look for it yourself.

896
01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:40.277
we have to go away

897
01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:42.382
we do not have time anymore,
I do not want to go

898
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:44.317
You're crazy huh

899
01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:48.321
Are you crazy? -You are the one who
makes us noisy so ya kuikat only

900
01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:54.350
until here you just menggaggu
and I will not bother you again

901
01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:00.233
Watch Out

902
01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:12.505
it looks like they do not see us. /
what if they see us?

903
01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:16.243
what if it happens?

904
01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:18.343
be careful

905
01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:26.424
hyungnim

906
01:39:28.228 --> 01:39:29.286
You come

907
01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:35.292
our hyungnim will help you,
then let's get out of here

908
01:39:35.536 --> 01:39:38.528
from here we will start the plan

909
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.240
from now on I hope you
guys are more alert

910
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:49.449
the first one we miss is
women, children and parents

911
01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:58.220
then only the men. please be careful because
we will pass a fairly heavy current

912
01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:02.452
bombs are needed to destroy them

913
01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:05.293
make as much as possible

914
01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:06.458
the more the better

915
01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:15.466
use tatami to hold bullets.
use the rope so we can cross

916
01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:21.504
grab gasoline as much as
possible from their ships

917
01:40:22.483 --> 01:40:27.318
beware when mngambil petrol

918
01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:03.312
what I've been working
on I hope to work well

919
01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:04.357
others, I hope to protect
our working friends

920
01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:08.258
That is all

921
01:41:10.264 --> 01:41:12.232
Do not like that

922
01:41:12.299 --> 01:41:15.393
why are you hitting me? aish!

923
01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:04.239
why are you here?

924
01:42:05.419 --> 01:42:07.353
I think the preparation is right.

925
01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:16.525
do not be like this, let's go together

926
01:42:17.331 --> 01:42:21.290
You think together can
live together too?

927
01:42:21.368 --> 01:42:24.394
do you want us together but
one of us died up in busan?

928
01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.439
then do you want to
just follow this plan?

929
01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:29.366
You too are injured

930
01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:33.403
if you die, then I too will die!

931
01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:55.463
hey, do not they eat dinner?

932
01:42:56.236 --> 01:42:58.227

933
01:43:08.248 --> 01:43:09.306

939
01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:36.308
Is it true? may i

Of course. we have
to party together

941
01:43:39.513 --> 01:43:44.314
yamada might be happy
with the drink this time

942
01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:47.353

943
01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:52.450

first we send is a woman first

945
01:44:57.324 --> 01:45:02.352
You feel there is something strange not? whether
some guards are getting fewer days huh?

946
01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:04.420
is this a bad sign?

947
01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:12.200
we can peek and find the answer here
we can know why they disappeared

948
01:45:22.349 --> 01:45:25.250
the rising wanitadulu

949
01:45:25.352 --> 01:45:31.291
I have to bring my son.

950
01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:36.386

no need to cry

958
01:47:30.477 --> 01:47:41.217
the wind blows and calms my mind

959
01:47:41.354 --> 01:47:46.348
there's nothing to worry about

960
01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:51.362
nothing to rant about

961
01:47:52.265 --> 01:48:03.403
this sense will we both feel

962
01:48:03.477 --> 01:48:14.354
all the fun will
be felt afterwards

963
01:48:41.314 --> 01:48:44.306
