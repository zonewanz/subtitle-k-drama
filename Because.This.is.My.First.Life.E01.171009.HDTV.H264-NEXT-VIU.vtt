00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:20.833
(September 17, 1996)

2
00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.502
Happy birthday to you

3
00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:26.302
Happy birthday to you

4
00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:29.802
Happy birthday dear So Yoon

5
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.972
Happy birthday to you

6
00:00:32.972 --> 00:00:34.743
At the age of nine,

7
00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.943
I learned something new.

8
00:00:36.943 --> 00:00:37.983
- So Yoon. - Yes?

9
00:00:37.983 --> 00:00:39.712
- You have to make a wish first. - Right.

10
00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:43.123
That before blowing out the candles, you should make a wish first.

11
00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:46.693
Happy birthday dear Ji Ho

12
00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:49.663
Happy birthday to you

13
00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:53.932
Let's eat.

14
00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:57.932
However, in our patriarchal house...

15
00:00:58.102 --> 00:01:00.432
(September 17, 2001)

16
00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:02.673
Happy birthday to you

17
00:01:02.673 --> 00:01:06.272
There's no way a daughter would have a chance...

18
00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:07.513
Let's eat.

19
00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:11.013
to make a wish.

20
00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:12.412
Let's eat.

21
00:01:12.412 --> 00:01:14.123
Let's eat.

22
00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:20.492
Happy birthday dear Ji Ho

23
00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:22.323
Happy birthday to you

24
00:01:23.623 --> 00:01:27.802
When I turned 20, I finally got to make my first wish.

25
00:01:28.662 --> 00:01:29.963
Happy birthday!

26
00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:32.502
Every year, my wish was the same.

27
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:37.642
Please help me become an excellent writer.

28
00:01:38.472 --> 00:01:39.942
And 10 years later...

29
00:01:40.173 --> 00:01:41.713
(Oscar...)

30
00:01:44.953 --> 00:01:48.522
I really became a writer.

31
00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:50.522
(Soo Hee: I want a divorce.)

32
00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:52.992
- I want a divorce. - What are you talking about?

33
00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:55.192
- Please... - I'm done talking. Bye.

34
00:01:56.192 --> 00:01:57.293
(Oscar grabs Soo Hee by the wrist.)

35
00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:03.332
(He slowly walks up to her.)

36
00:02:12.013 --> 00:02:13.973
(He slowly reaches out his hand...)

37
00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:18.353
(towards the back of Soo Hee's pale neck.)

38
00:02:24.122 --> 00:02:25.193
(From the bookshelf, he takes out...)

39
00:02:27.323 --> 00:02:29.323
(a packet of red ginseng and drinks it.)

40
00:02:35.263 --> 00:02:38.033
I'm the assistant writer of a melodrama.

41
00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:40.332
I've been assisting for five years.

42
00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:44.073
I have enough experience to write the sublines, but...

43
00:02:44.073 --> 00:02:46.473
- Hey! - My goodness.

44
00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:48.312
What do you think you're doing?

45
00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:50.913
I was told to clean up...

46
00:02:51.312 --> 00:02:52.582
after the baby clothes.

47
00:02:53.612 --> 00:02:54.622
Give it to me.

48
00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:58.592
Get out! Don't you dare come in my room again!

49
00:03:01.892 --> 00:03:03.323
My baby...

50
00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:05.733
I won't forgive you,

51
00:03:06.432 --> 00:03:07.603
Oscar.

52
00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:15.242
(Red velvet lipstick, used three times by lead actress)

53
00:03:15.242 --> 00:03:16.242
(Worth 30,000 dollars)

54
00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:24.652
The most important part of my job is to raise funds.

55
00:03:27.212 --> 00:03:29.853
Sir, what are you doing here at this hour?

56
00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:31.253
Gosh!

57
00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:33.892
How dare you disobey me?

58
00:03:33.892 --> 00:03:35.492
Get out of my house!

59
00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:37.932
Fine, I'll leave.

60
00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:41.263
You'll regret this forever.

61
00:03:57.783 --> 00:03:59.353
(Get the lead actor on an electric hoverboard)

62
00:04:01.253 --> 00:04:02.522
Finally,

63
00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:05.022
I'm free!

64
00:04:05.753 --> 00:04:08.763
It's not my fault there's so much product placement.

65
00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:10.832
Had you used them throughout,

66
00:04:10.832 --> 00:04:12.962
I wouldn't have had to push them in one episode.

67
00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:13.992
What?

68
00:04:14.362 --> 00:04:16.733
I don't know! Stop calling me.

69
00:04:16.963 --> 00:04:19.572
It's already so hectic.

70
00:04:21.903 --> 00:04:24.413
After kissing, she should slap him.

71
00:04:24.673 --> 00:04:27.942
Or should she slap him first then kiss? I don't know...

72
00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:29.182
- Ma'am. - Yes?

73
00:04:32.012 --> 00:04:34.983
- I uploaded the final draft. - Okay.

74
00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.492
I used red ginseng, makeup,

75
00:04:37.492 --> 00:04:39.593
and everything else.

76
00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:41.992
Okay, great. I better delete this.

77
00:04:44.093 --> 00:04:47.233
Ma'am, I'll get going now.

78
00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:48.632
Okay, where?

79
00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:51.733
- Gosh, are you going home? - Yes.

80
00:04:51.973 --> 00:04:53.273
Okay. Thank you for your work.

81
00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:55.473
Has it been a month?

82
00:04:55.643 --> 00:04:57.473
No, three months.

83
00:04:57.473 --> 00:04:59.343
Has it been that long?

84
00:04:59.742 --> 00:05:01.913
Okay. You said you live in Gangdong-gu, right?

85
00:05:01.913 --> 00:05:04.012
Gangseo-gu.

86
00:05:04.283 --> 00:05:05.283
Gangseo-gu?

87
00:05:05.752 --> 00:05:07.012
Right, you told me this.

88
00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:08.523
You live with your older sister.

89
00:05:08.523 --> 00:05:10.182
With my younger brother.

90
00:05:15.723 --> 00:05:16.923
Who is he?

91
00:05:17.562 --> 00:05:18.733
Okay, you can go.

92
00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:21.362
I'll see you at our end-of-series party.

93
00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:41.723
It's sunlight.

94
00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:50.762
Yes, it's me.

95
00:05:51.692 --> 00:05:54.733
Where else? I'm going home.

96
00:06:02.572 --> 00:06:04.512
It's been three months.

97
00:06:07.713 --> 00:06:11.452
Once I'm home, I'm going to take a hot shower,

98
00:06:11.853 --> 00:06:14.252
then I'm going under my sheets on my bed...

99
00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:18.353
and then sleep like a corpse.

100
00:06:18.752 --> 00:06:20.862
What is Ji Seok doing?

101
00:06:20.862 --> 00:06:23.923
If he's leeching off of you, he should at least come get you.

102
00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:26.833
You're asking for too much.

103
00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:30.973
I'd be thankful if he didn't burn the place down.

104
00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:32.702
Anyway, go straight to bed when you get home.

105
00:06:32.702 --> 00:06:34.702
Don't start cleaning or doing the laundry.

106
00:06:34.702 --> 00:06:37.612
- Also, don't take Ho Rang's call. - Why not?

107
00:06:37.643 --> 00:06:40.242
They had a fight again. It'll take at least two hours.

108
00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:44.083
I see. Okay.

109
00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:02.932
I'm home.

110
00:07:10.812 --> 00:07:12.872
Seriously? His underwear...

111
00:07:15.343 --> 00:07:17.812
Ji Seok, I'm home.

112
00:07:22.653 --> 00:07:23.653
(Ho Rang)

113
00:07:25.723 --> 00:07:26.923
Yes, it's me.

114
00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:30.463
To be honest, he couldn't have dared...

115
00:07:30.463 --> 00:07:33.692
to strike up a conversation with me seven years ago.

116
00:07:33.692 --> 00:07:35.963
He looked like a bear, and I turned him into a human.

117
00:07:35.963 --> 00:07:38.132
And now he wants to live with his grandma?

118
00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:40.673
That's too much.

119
00:07:40.673 --> 00:07:42.843
Did you just laugh, Ji Ho?

120
00:07:42.843 --> 00:07:43.942
No.

121
00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:47.942
- I didn't. - Ms. Yang.

122
00:07:47.942 --> 00:07:50.442
Ji Ho, I have to go. We can talk in detail later.

123
00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:51.512
Okay.

124
00:07:52.512 --> 00:07:54.353
(Ho Rang, call time 41:54)

125
00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:56.153
Talk in detail later?

126
00:07:59.593 --> 00:08:01.262
Did I have a bra in this color?

127
00:08:02.822 --> 00:08:04.562
It's not my size either.

128
00:08:05.163 --> 00:08:06.632
Ji Seok!

129
00:08:07.562 --> 00:08:09.802
I'm home, but he doesn't bother to even say hello.

130
00:08:09.802 --> 00:08:12.872
How can you listen to music with the house looking like this?

131
00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:17.103
I told you to wash the towels and your underwear right away.

132
00:08:18.742 --> 00:08:20.473
Are you playing games again?

133
00:08:23.083 --> 00:08:24.353
Ji Ho!

134
00:08:25.512 --> 00:08:27.182
- My eyes! - No, no.

135
00:08:27.182 --> 00:08:30.423
Wait, wait, wait! Ji Ho!

136
00:08:31.992 --> 00:08:33.753
Ji Ho!

137
00:08:33.852 --> 00:08:36.222
Hold on! Ji Ho!

138
00:08:36.222 --> 00:08:37.832
- Don't follow me! - Ji Ho!

139
00:08:37.832 --> 00:08:39.533
- Don't follow me! - Hold on!

140
00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:42.403
- Don't come after me! - Wait a second!

141
00:08:43.062 --> 00:08:45.972
- Ji Ho! Wait. Hold on. - Go away!

142
00:08:48.842 --> 00:08:50.442
Ji Ho, are you okay?

143
00:08:50.712 --> 00:08:52.942
Did you get hurt? Did you sprain your ankle?

144
00:08:54.712 --> 00:08:57.552
Ji Seok, I'm okay.

145
00:08:58.052 --> 00:09:01.182
I really want to be alone right now.

146
00:09:01.182 --> 00:09:03.653
You can finish what you were doing.

147
00:09:03.653 --> 00:09:04.993
Finish what?

148
00:09:06.653 --> 00:09:08.293
Let's go back. You should say hello.

149
00:09:09.562 --> 00:09:12.962
To whom? The woman that was naked?

150
00:09:12.962 --> 00:09:14.263
No, no.

151
00:09:15.163 --> 00:09:16.462
That's okay.

152
00:09:16.732 --> 00:09:19.932
I have to meet someone. I almost forgot.

153
00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.643
I have such a bad memory.

154
00:09:24.173 --> 00:09:26.673
I'm going to be home really late,

155
00:09:26.673 --> 00:09:29.743
so you can tell her to enjoy her time before she goes.

156
00:09:30.682 --> 00:09:33.082
Okay. I'll get going.

157
00:09:33.082 --> 00:09:34.452
Come on.

158
00:09:34.452 --> 00:09:36.523
She's not going anywhere. She lives here.

159
00:09:37.923 --> 00:09:40.822
- Why? - She's...

160
00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:42.222
She's my wife.

161
00:09:44.092 --> 00:09:45.263
Since when?

162
00:09:45.263 --> 00:09:48.062
It's been four months.

163
00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:50.972
You're going to become an aunt.

164
00:09:52.802 --> 00:09:56.342
You're going to be an aunt. She's pregnant.

165
00:09:57.373 --> 00:09:59.513
No one seems to realize,

166
00:10:01.812 --> 00:10:03.143
but today is...

167
00:10:04.253 --> 00:10:07.052
It's my 30th birthday.

168
00:10:09.452 --> 00:10:13.192
(Episode 1: Because This Is My First 30th Birthday)

169
00:10:26.702 --> 00:10:29.173
It must have been hard driving up, Father.

170
00:10:29.972 --> 00:10:31.143
Father?

171
00:10:31.312 --> 00:10:32.342
Not at all.

172
00:10:33.743 --> 00:10:35.812
Aren't you tired, sweetheart?

173
00:10:36.543 --> 00:10:37.653
"Sweetheart"?

174
00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:45.222
I bet you already heard from Ji Seok,

175
00:10:45.253 --> 00:10:48.993
but I couldn't tell you ahead because you were busy working.

176
00:10:49.822 --> 00:10:51.663
Anyway, since we are all family,

177
00:10:52.263 --> 00:10:54.932
use the toilet fairly and give the turn to the urgent one.

178
00:10:55.533 --> 00:10:58.432
Be nice to each other, and live well together, okay?

179
00:10:58.472 --> 00:10:59.702
- Live together? - Live together?

180
00:10:59.732 --> 00:11:01.903
- The three of us? - Why? Can't you do that?

181
00:11:02.003 --> 00:11:03.543
- No way! - I can't!

182
00:11:03.543 --> 00:11:06.113
- They're a newlywed! - We're a newlywed!

183
00:11:07.143 --> 00:11:08.883
Then what do you want me to do?

184
00:11:12.682 --> 00:11:15.623
Hey, of course Ji Seok should move out.

185
00:11:15.822 --> 00:11:17.692
You paid for the living expenses and maintenance as well.

186
00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:20.763
How dare he ask you to move out when he's a jobless student?

187
00:11:21.092 --> 00:11:23.592
Ji Ho, that house is registered under your name.

188
00:11:23.592 --> 00:11:25.993
There won't be any problem legally as well.

189
00:11:26.363 --> 00:11:27.363
The house?

190
00:11:28.363 --> 00:11:29.802
It's under Ji Seok's name.

191
00:11:29.832 --> 00:11:31.432
What? How come?

192
00:11:31.873 --> 00:11:34.143
You paid the provisional deposit when your dad bought the house.

193
00:11:34.643 --> 00:11:36.543
You don't know anything because you lived in the States.

194
00:11:36.802 --> 00:11:38.972
When parents buy a house for their son and daughter in Korea,

195
00:11:38.972 --> 00:11:40.273
it naturally belongs to the son.

196
00:11:40.472 --> 00:11:42.743
That's like paying for their future generation...

197
00:11:42.743 --> 00:11:45.552
and future ancestral rites after the parents pass away.

198
00:11:45.812 --> 00:11:48.552
Ji Seok is responsible for continuing their family.

199
00:11:48.883 --> 00:11:51.023
Her father wouldn't even take into consideration how much she paid.

200
00:11:51.023 --> 00:11:54.493
Hey! It's such an old-fashioned way of thinking.

201
00:11:55.962 --> 00:11:56.993
Ji Ho.

202
00:11:57.533 --> 00:11:59.192
You should get pregnant tonight as well.

203
00:11:59.393 --> 00:12:00.732
Get up, we're going to a club.

204
00:12:00.802 --> 00:12:03.863
You should get pregnant to prove you can continue the family too.

205
00:12:03.863 --> 00:12:04.873
Okay.

206
00:12:04.972 --> 00:12:06.602
You're playing games again, aren't you?

207
00:12:10.643 --> 00:12:11.873
Hold on.

208
00:12:12.472 --> 00:12:16.342
Can you not mention such things in front of me for a while?

209
00:12:16.643 --> 00:12:18.312
I actually...

210
00:12:19.582 --> 00:12:22.153
witnessed Ji Seok doing it.

211
00:12:22.383 --> 00:12:23.623
Getting his wife pregnant.

212
00:12:23.822 --> 00:12:25.552
- What the... - I know.

213
00:12:26.092 --> 00:12:27.562
I wish I hadn't,

214
00:12:28.663 --> 00:12:30.263
but now that I have, I can't live with them.

215
00:12:34.033 --> 00:12:35.302
But how?

216
00:12:36.332 --> 00:12:38.773
I was in the balcony for a while to talk to you on the phone.

217
00:12:39.173 --> 00:12:40.972
So he didn't know I was home.

218
00:12:40.972 --> 00:12:43.403
How long did you guys talk on the phone?

219
00:12:43.572 --> 00:12:44.972
For about 40 minutes.

220
00:12:46.942 --> 00:12:48.942
That means Ji Seok did it for 40 minutes as well.

221
00:12:52.212 --> 00:12:54.352
I didn't know he's that energetic.

222
00:12:54.452 --> 00:12:56.582
- Gosh, you. - What?

223
00:13:00.123 --> 00:13:02.592
What? You want me to move out right away?

224
00:13:05.232 --> 00:13:07.832
Excuse me, I thought...

225
00:13:08.003 --> 00:13:10.602
of you as a real brother.

226
00:13:11.232 --> 00:13:14.543
I wanted to take care of you like a real brother.

227
00:13:16.102 --> 00:13:18.572
Please bring me two drops of vinegar.

228
00:13:19.243 --> 00:13:21.682
I really thought of you as my real brother.

229
00:13:22.582 --> 00:13:24.952
I thought we were like real brothers.

230
00:13:25.253 --> 00:13:28.023
Real brothers, you know what I'm talking about?

231
00:13:28.352 --> 00:13:31.123
- Do you get it? - I don't. I'm an only son.

232
00:13:32.653 --> 00:13:34.592
This is the first contract we wrote.

233
00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:37.092
The articles are as written there.

234
00:13:37.293 --> 00:13:39.692
While the party resides in the owner's house,

235
00:13:39.692 --> 00:13:42.533
the party has to follow the following rules.

236
00:13:42.533 --> 00:13:44.702
You didn't follow the first rule.

237
00:13:44.702 --> 00:13:47.072
You didn't follow the 2nd and 3rd rules as well.

238
00:13:47.072 --> 00:13:49.673
Then give me back this month's rent.

239
00:13:52.773 --> 00:13:55.883
You came back home drunk last Friday night.

240
00:13:57.352 --> 00:14:00.352
You forgot the password and kicked the front door for 10 minutes.

241
00:14:00.482 --> 00:14:03.852
You ate five cans that belong to my cat, thinking they're tuna cans.

242
00:14:03.852 --> 00:14:07.923
And you peed in the refrigerator.

243
00:14:09.462 --> 00:14:11.663
Were you home that night?

244
00:14:13.263 --> 00:14:14.403
I thought you were on a business trip.

245
00:14:14.403 --> 00:14:16.363
And the police came to my house.

246
00:14:16.363 --> 00:14:18.133
That's right.

247
00:14:18.332 --> 00:14:20.373
Someone reported me to the police.

248
00:14:20.373 --> 00:14:23.072
I reported you from my room.

249
00:14:24.003 --> 00:14:26.472
Are you crazy, you jerk? Hey, you!

250
00:14:26.543 --> 00:14:28.143
If you were home,

251
00:14:28.143 --> 00:14:30.543
why didn't you come out and talk to me first?

252
00:14:30.783 --> 00:14:32.352
Isn't that the right thing to do?

253
00:14:32.352 --> 00:14:34.552
He's a complete lunatic.

254
00:14:35.852 --> 00:14:39.923
How could you possibly report your roommate to the police?

255
00:14:39.952 --> 00:14:42.763
He should be thankful that I didn't charge him for the fridge.

256
00:14:43.062 --> 00:14:44.533
Tell that to your friend.

257
00:14:44.692 --> 00:14:46.562
But he's a really nice guy.

258
00:14:46.562 --> 00:14:49.403
You might not know, but there's such thing as being humane.

259
00:14:49.403 --> 00:14:52.202
You know what "humane" means?

260
00:14:53.932 --> 00:14:55.972
Doesn't that mean uncivilized for that guy?

261
00:14:55.972 --> 00:14:58.273
No, it's being humane.

262
00:14:58.513 --> 00:15:00.143
Being a normal human.

263
00:15:00.143 --> 00:15:01.942
That reminds me of this.

264
00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:04.082
Tell him that the cans he ate...

265
00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:06.812
are very expensive because they're imported.

266
00:15:09.082 --> 00:15:10.653
- Where are you going? - Home.

267
00:15:10.722 --> 00:15:12.552
What are you talking about?

268
00:15:12.952 --> 00:15:14.962
You must complete stabilizing the website today.

269
00:15:14.962 --> 00:15:17.462
The update for the new version is due next week.

270
00:15:17.493 --> 00:15:20.033
The recycling is due today,

271
00:15:21.232 --> 00:15:24.273
and I have to feed my cat like a human.

272
00:15:28.102 --> 00:15:29.173
No!

273
00:15:31.543 --> 00:15:33.543
I'm sorry. Please continue your work.

274
00:16:00.403 --> 00:16:01.442
Here we go.

275
00:16:02.743 --> 00:16:04.003
For five years,

276
00:16:04.513 --> 00:16:06.773
I was in charge of managing the house...

277
00:16:06.773 --> 00:16:10.143
and taking care of everything.

278
00:16:11.582 --> 00:16:12.952
Therefore,

279
00:16:13.513 --> 00:16:17.283
the current situation where I have to be treated like a guest...

280
00:16:17.753 --> 00:16:19.222
is clearly...

281
00:16:20.763 --> 00:16:22.493
Clearly...

282
00:16:22.493 --> 00:16:24.893
It clearly violates my fundamental rights.

283
00:16:25.232 --> 00:16:27.232
I was the one who paid for the provisional deposit.

284
00:16:27.232 --> 00:16:29.633
I was the one who bought the fridge with my first salary.

285
00:16:29.633 --> 00:16:32.773
I was also the one who changed the heater last year, wasn't I?

286
00:16:32.773 --> 00:16:34.442
Say this to your dad,

287
00:16:34.673 --> 00:16:36.472
and fight for your rights.

288
00:16:44.682 --> 00:16:45.753
Dad.

289
00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:52.092
I have something to...

290
00:16:52.222 --> 00:16:54.293
I have something to tell you, Father.

291
00:16:55.623 --> 00:16:58.062
Oh, what is it, sweetheart?

292
00:16:58.363 --> 00:17:01.133
I went to the hospital today...

293
00:17:01.133 --> 00:17:03.062
- Hold on, Dad. - It's a boy.

294
00:17:05.573 --> 00:17:07.442
- A boy? - Game...

295
00:17:15.282 --> 00:17:16.512
over.

296
00:17:20.282 --> 00:17:21.823
Oh, my goodness.

297
00:17:21.823 --> 00:17:24.393
Let me see that. Excellent job!

298
00:17:29.863 --> 00:17:31.262
Do you think Ji Ho is talking to her dad?

299
00:17:33.432 --> 00:17:35.603
I feel like it's not going well.

300
00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:39.002
I don't thinks she's doing well.

301
00:17:43.073 --> 00:17:45.313
Do you want another glass of beer?

302
00:17:45.643 --> 00:17:46.643
I'm full.

303
00:17:48.012 --> 00:17:50.813
Then do you want to go to Itaewon? There are many clubs there.

304
00:17:51.313 --> 00:17:53.913
Stop being unlike yourself and call Won Seok.

305
00:17:54.153 --> 00:17:56.222
I told you we broke up!

306
00:17:58.292 --> 00:17:59.722
Are you not wearing a bra again?

307
00:17:59.752 --> 00:18:02.593
It suffocates me. I can't digest well if I wear it.

308
00:18:02.593 --> 00:18:05.063
Hide them with your bag. It's showing.

309
00:18:05.063 --> 00:18:07.403
Hey, are you two really broken up?

310
00:18:07.663 --> 00:18:09.633
Yes, it's for real this time.

311
00:18:10.363 --> 00:18:12.573
He didn't call me for three days. That means he wants to break up.

312
00:18:12.972 --> 00:18:16.803
We're done with being clingy and obsessed with each other.

313
00:18:23.843 --> 00:18:25.752
Won Seok, she's going to a club.

314
00:18:27.012 --> 00:18:28.482
That little...

315
00:18:36.992 --> 00:18:39.732
(Rooms available in Sangam-dong)

316
00:18:39.732 --> 00:18:41.063
His nose is so high...

317
00:18:41.303 --> 00:18:43.403
because he's a boy.

318
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:45.573
Isn't he pretty, Father?

319
00:19:03.282 --> 00:19:04.353
Eat up.

320
00:19:05.923 --> 00:19:07.623
Why did you bring me seaweed soup at night?

321
00:19:08.022 --> 00:19:11.292
You should at least have that since it's your birthday.

322
00:19:12.563 --> 00:19:15.333
Right, today was my birthday.

323
00:19:16.103 --> 00:19:17.633
I totally forgot.

324
00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:21.673
He's really pretty.

325
00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:28.742
Why is that little brat laughing so much?

326
00:19:29.413 --> 00:19:32.252
I told him to get a job,

327
00:19:32.252 --> 00:19:33.712
not a son.

328
00:19:35.853 --> 00:19:36.982
What can we do now?

329
00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:40.593
He impregnated her. He can't undo it.

330
00:19:50.002 --> 00:19:51.073
What's this?

331
00:19:51.603 --> 00:19:54.643
You'll need some deposit if you're getting a room.

332
00:19:55.472 --> 00:19:58.643
You can't live together with the newlywed.

333
00:20:00.042 --> 00:20:01.143
Mom.

334
00:20:01.383 --> 00:20:03.413
Keep it a secret from your dad.

335
00:20:03.883 --> 00:20:07.113
He'd be really upset if he finds out that I secretly saved money.

336
00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:20.663
For the 30 years she has spent with a stern husband,

337
00:20:21.702 --> 00:20:23.603
she has always been on my side.

338
00:20:31.542 --> 00:20:32.742
The problem is that...

339
00:20:39.383 --> 00:20:43.782
I just know nothing about the world.

340
00:20:44.553 --> 00:20:47.053
(Loan)

341
00:20:49.762 --> 00:20:53.563
Sorry, I'm afraid to say that we can't help you get a loan.

342
00:20:55.603 --> 00:20:57.573
Are you sure?

343
00:20:57.573 --> 00:21:00.603
Yes. You are a freelancer now,

344
00:21:00.603 --> 00:21:03.143
and your annual income is less than 20,000 dollars.

345
00:21:03.143 --> 00:21:05.512
You don't have employment insurance either.

346
00:21:05.512 --> 00:21:07.883
Your credit rating is considered fifth rank.

347
00:21:08.442 --> 00:21:09.442
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:10.042 --> 00:21:11.212
But...

349
00:21:13.182 --> 00:21:15.583
this is the TV drama I wrote.

350
00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:18.393
It did pretty well last year.

351
00:21:18.393 --> 00:21:20.252
Even though it was a morning show.

352
00:21:21.462 --> 00:21:23.123
It's really easy to guarantee who I am.

353
00:21:23.123 --> 00:21:26.093
You can see my name here.

354
00:21:26.093 --> 00:21:28.103
Can't you see it? There's my name, Yoon Ji Ho.

355
00:21:28.563 --> 00:21:32.573
Wait, this is what I also wrote.

356
00:21:33.373 --> 00:21:35.972
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

357
00:21:38.613 --> 00:21:41.442
I see. I guess you haven't seen it.

358
00:21:43.343 --> 00:21:45.282
(Daeun Realtor)

359
00:21:53.623 --> 00:21:56.563
- Hi. - Please come in.

360
00:21:58.663 --> 00:22:00.863
I'm looking for an apartment.

361
00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:02.863
How much deposit can you spend?

362
00:22:04.702 --> 00:22:06.903
This much.

363
00:22:07.873 --> 00:22:09.002
Do you mean 30,000 dollars?

364
00:22:09.502 --> 00:22:10.542
Not really.

365
00:22:23.083 --> 00:22:25.093
You are really lucky.

366
00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:27.923
If it wasn't me, you wouldn't be able to find a place like this.

367
00:22:28.663 --> 00:22:32.532
I guess so.

368
00:22:40.603 --> 00:22:42.843
Sir, I think someone...

369
00:22:43.343 --> 00:22:46.742
drew a window here, right?

370
00:22:46.742 --> 00:22:48.913
I know. It looks real, doesn't it?

371
00:23:00.893 --> 00:23:02.692
(Danger of collapsing)

372
00:23:06.762 --> 00:23:08.762
(Frequent leakage and no soundproofing)

373
00:23:13.032 --> 00:23:15.073
(Less than 36 square feet, no kitchen and no bathroom)

374
00:23:22.212 --> 00:23:25.182
The deadline for the new update is in a week.

375
00:23:25.182 --> 00:23:27.353
Should we check the main considerations?

376
00:23:27.853 --> 00:23:30.952
Mr. Nam, you were going to make the plan for the stabilization.

377
00:23:30.952 --> 00:23:33.192
Did you finish it yet?

378
00:23:33.192 --> 00:23:35.563
Not yet. It's in progress.

379
00:23:37.462 --> 00:23:40.702
Mr. Nam, at least you have to turn in the first draft today.

380
00:23:40.702 --> 00:23:42.202
It's impossible.

381
00:23:42.202 --> 00:23:43.903
The workload is too heavy...

382
00:23:43.903 --> 00:23:46.272
to finish before 6pm.

383
00:23:51.113 --> 00:23:53.712
Are you talking about going home now?

384
00:23:53.712 --> 00:23:56.542
We work overtime at night. How effective is that?

385
00:23:56.542 --> 00:23:58.053
I don't think I can do that for the time being.

386
00:23:58.053 --> 00:24:00.113
Except the major duties I have to take care of,

387
00:24:00.113 --> 00:24:02.583
I made a list for everyone...

388
00:24:02.583 --> 00:24:04.823
to divide the work, so you should...

389
00:24:04.823 --> 00:24:08.022
Did you get a new job or something?

390
00:24:09.563 --> 00:24:10.863
That's not what it is.

391
00:24:11.393 --> 00:24:14.932
I just need to feed the cat in the evening.

392
00:24:16.962 --> 00:24:18.532
I have to recycle too.

393
00:24:23.972 --> 00:24:25.613
I see.

394
00:24:25.913 --> 00:24:28.012
I do understand you are upset at me...

395
00:24:28.012 --> 00:24:29.442
because of the housemate I introduced to you.

396
00:24:29.442 --> 00:24:33.282
But you are a grown-up. You can't just take it out on me like this.

397
00:24:33.282 --> 00:24:34.782
We are making a business here.

398
00:24:34.782 --> 00:24:36.182
The deadline is in a week.

399
00:24:36.182 --> 00:24:37.323
Sang Goo.

400
00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:40.893
What was the first condition for me to work here?

401
00:24:40.893 --> 00:24:41.962
Your salary.

402
00:24:42.563 --> 00:24:43.692
I don't think so.

403
00:24:46.093 --> 00:24:48.403
I think it was something about...

404
00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:50.403
Was it the orgasm? Well, I don't think it is.

405
00:24:50.403 --> 00:24:52.673
Oh, it's algorithm.

406
00:24:52.673 --> 00:24:55.242
It was about your algorithm being...

407
00:24:55.242 --> 00:24:58.442
The company can't break the algorithms of my life.

408
00:24:58.972 --> 00:25:01.182
I don't have a housemate anymore because of you.

409
00:25:01.182 --> 00:25:02.782
It broke my algorithm.

410
00:25:02.782 --> 00:25:05.153
I can't work overtime at night...

411
00:25:05.583 --> 00:25:06.913
until my life gets back to normal.

412
00:25:11.222 --> 00:25:12.222
Okay.

413
00:25:12.992 --> 00:25:16.222
I will find him a housemate...

414
00:25:16.222 --> 00:25:19.163
and make him work for me forever.

415
00:25:19.962 --> 00:25:23.633
You still don't know how determined I am.

416
00:25:40.512 --> 00:25:44.722
How many dramas do I have to write to live in such places?

417
00:25:46.452 --> 00:25:49.593
(Ho Rang)

418
00:25:50.893 --> 00:25:53.262
- Hi, this is Ji Ho. - Did you find an apartment?

419
00:25:54.702 --> 00:25:57.573
Not yet.

420
00:25:59.833 --> 00:26:02.603
What? No deposit required?

421
00:26:02.702 --> 00:26:04.712
Yes. You only need to pay 300 dollars a month.

422
00:26:04.712 --> 00:26:06.113
300 dollars?

423
00:26:06.113 --> 00:26:08.482
Where is it? I can go there right now.

424
00:26:08.482 --> 00:26:10.542
But there's some conditions.

425
00:26:14.952 --> 00:26:15.952
Ji Ho!

426
00:26:16.383 --> 00:26:18.222
- Do you want to drink something? - I'm okay.

427
00:26:18.222 --> 00:26:20.423
Who is it? Is it someone Won Seok knows?

428
00:26:20.423 --> 00:26:23.163
Yes, it's his university friend's friend, Nam Se Hee.

429
00:26:23.163 --> 00:26:25.333
It's a two-room apartment, and there's a small spare room.

430
00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:26.932
It's for lease.

431
00:26:26.932 --> 00:26:29.262
Basically, she wants someone who can pay rent and be her housemate.

432
00:26:29.262 --> 00:26:30.803
- Is it a town house? - Yes, it is.

433
00:26:30.803 --> 00:26:33.932
But she wants a lot of things.

434
00:26:33.932 --> 00:26:36.272
- She wants you to move in now. - I can do that.

435
00:26:36.272 --> 00:26:39.373
- She needs a week of adjustment. - I can do that even for a month.

436
00:26:39.373 --> 00:26:42.883
She seems a bit crazy though. Are you going to be okay with that?

437
00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:45.913
Ho Rang, I've been working for...

438
00:26:45.913 --> 00:26:49.282
the most sensitive and crazy writers in Korea...

439
00:26:49.282 --> 00:26:51.952
for the last five years as their assistant.

440
00:26:52.123 --> 00:26:54.692
Now, I have an ability to serve any crazy people in the world.

441
00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:59.093
I see. I'll tell Won Seok to give your number to her now.

442
00:27:00.262 --> 00:27:01.603
I guess you guys made up.

443
00:27:02.502 --> 00:27:05.673
We didn't. I'm just being generous.

444
00:27:05.932 --> 00:27:08.002
It didn't go for too long this time.

445
00:27:08.373 --> 00:27:10.873
Won Seok definitely knows how to make you feel better.

446
00:27:10.873 --> 00:27:12.343
He got better than before.

447
00:27:13.813 --> 00:27:15.113
I mean, he has some skills now.

448
00:27:17.512 --> 00:27:18.583
Right, I know what you mean.

449
00:27:18.913 --> 00:27:21.083
I don't think I want to hear anything from you anymore.

450
00:27:21.883 --> 00:27:25.022
Last night, Won Seok was...

451
00:27:25.353 --> 00:27:27.093
He just came over to me like this.

452
00:27:27.093 --> 00:27:29.992
No, I don't want to know about it. Can I have some water, please?

453
00:27:35.932 --> 00:27:39.432
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

454
00:27:39.432 --> 00:27:42.173
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

455
00:27:42.843 --> 00:27:46.573
Happy birthday, dear my sister Happy birthday to you

456
00:27:48.643 --> 00:27:51.153
Eun Sol bought you a cake to celebrate your birthday.

457
00:27:51.153 --> 00:27:52.583
Make a wish.

458
00:28:01.363 --> 00:28:03.962
What's your wish?

459
00:28:04.432 --> 00:28:07.432
I want to be a snail in my next life.

460
00:28:09.103 --> 00:28:12.032
- Why? - They will never get kicked out.

461
00:28:13.232 --> 00:28:14.542
That's harsh.

462
00:28:14.542 --> 00:28:17.073
Are you trying to distress her on purpose? She's pregnant.

463
00:28:17.073 --> 00:28:21.242
She even bought you a cake. This is why I can't live with you.

464
00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:28.653
Please don't leave like this.

465
00:28:29.423 --> 00:28:31.192
You can come visit us any time.

466
00:28:31.952 --> 00:28:34.722
I really don't mind living with you.

467
00:28:37.323 --> 00:28:38.893
Are you sure?

468
00:28:39.792 --> 00:28:41.633
When Ji Seok is at school,

469
00:28:42.262 --> 00:28:44.502
it will be only two of us in that apartment.

470
00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:49.702
I can't see you doing any house chores either. You are pregnant.

471
00:28:53.042 --> 00:28:54.682
Ji Seok will always...

472
00:28:54.682 --> 00:28:57.042
want me to take care of your kid too.

473
00:28:57.553 --> 00:29:00.613
Do you want me to work, do all the house chores...

474
00:29:01.123 --> 00:29:02.923
and babysit for you guys?

475
00:29:05.653 --> 00:29:08.292
I know you are young and oblivious.

476
00:29:09.722 --> 00:29:11.762
Just don't make me a bad person.

477
00:29:16.633 --> 00:29:18.202
I heard you like barbeque.

478
00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:20.373
You can use this money for that.

479
00:29:20.942 --> 00:29:22.573
If you have any left,

480
00:29:24.042 --> 00:29:26.772
you can use the money for your dad's hospital bills too.

481
00:29:39.123 --> 00:29:42.262
It's the room 401 of Matinum Town House.

482
00:29:42.262 --> 00:29:44.462
I attached the map too.

483
00:29:49.262 --> 00:29:51.232
This is the passcode to get in.

484
00:30:00.073 --> 00:30:02.012
Excuse me.

485
00:30:03.182 --> 00:30:06.482
Since I'm working late at night these days, I won't be home early.

486
00:30:12.653 --> 00:30:14.192
You'll see two rooms.

487
00:30:15.863 --> 00:30:18.833
The one with the door open is yours.

488
00:30:25.032 --> 00:30:28.542
My door will always be closed, so don't mind that.

489
00:30:29.873 --> 00:30:32.242
There are three things I want to ask you to do for me.

490
00:30:32.242 --> 00:30:34.982
First, I need you to do the house chores.

491
00:30:35.982 --> 00:30:38.712
Second, I need you to empty the recycling bin once a week.

492
00:30:43.823 --> 00:30:46.053
Lastly, I want you to take care of my kitty...

493
00:30:46.853 --> 00:30:47.863
Hello.

494
00:30:48.063 --> 00:30:49.992
while I work overtime at night.

495
00:30:52.262 --> 00:30:54.863
You must've heard this already, but what do you think about...

496
00:30:55.032 --> 00:30:56.103
signing a contract after a week?

497
00:30:56.403 --> 00:30:58.133
Sure, I'm fine with that.

498
00:30:58.833 --> 00:31:01.373
I can't believe they do internship even for tenants.

499
00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:03.472
What a country.

500
00:31:03.472 --> 00:31:06.042
I heard she went through a hard time because of her previous tenant.

501
00:31:06.173 --> 00:31:08.242
I'll have to do my best. And I'm fine with it.

502
00:31:08.442 --> 00:31:10.242
What does your landlady do for a living?

503
00:31:10.282 --> 00:31:12.053
She's a designer or something like that.

504
00:31:13.583 --> 00:31:14.722
It's about computer designing.

505
00:31:15.383 --> 00:31:17.823
I didn't get to see her face yet because she was busy with work.

506
00:31:18.123 --> 00:31:19.423
I guess she's extremely busy.

507
00:31:20.992 --> 00:31:23.323
I have a picture of her. You want to see?

508
00:31:24.992 --> 00:31:26.692
- Here. - That's her?

509
00:31:27.063 --> 00:31:28.063
She looks friendly.

510
00:31:28.202 --> 00:31:30.303
She was born in 1980.

511
00:31:30.502 --> 00:31:31.772
Doesn't she look so young?

512
00:31:33.133 --> 00:31:35.442
She did a really good job taking care of herself.

513
00:31:36.242 --> 00:31:37.303
What's her name again?

514
00:31:37.673 --> 00:31:40.272
Se Hee. Nam Se Hee.

515
00:31:49.752 --> 00:31:53.093
- Se Hee. - Yes, Bo Mi?

516
00:31:54.593 --> 00:31:58.133
As you can see, people give up on singing up due to its long process.

517
00:31:58.133 --> 00:32:00.633
Especially when they get to entering their personal information.

518
00:32:00.932 --> 00:32:04.772
I think we should shorten the process in our new version.

519
00:32:05.073 --> 00:32:06.472
Okay.

520
00:32:08.002 --> 00:32:09.073
By the way, Bo Mi.

521
00:32:10.042 --> 00:32:11.413
Isn't that uncomfortable?

522
00:32:12.843 --> 00:32:16.613
You seem to wear that dress every time the deadline comes near.

523
00:32:16.742 --> 00:32:20.252
I should at least wear this so that I don't forget my sexual identity.

524
00:32:41.742 --> 00:32:42.942
I guess you're working overtime today.

525
00:32:43.343 --> 00:32:45.173
I moved in as scheduled.

526
00:32:48.442 --> 00:32:50.583
(Yoon Ji Ho)

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

528
00:33:07.432 --> 00:33:08.732
Did you have a good day?

529
00:33:09.202 --> 00:33:11.002
It's too late, so I'm leaving you a memo.

530
00:33:11.833 --> 00:33:15.472
I emptied the recycling bins this morning.

531
00:33:17.843 --> 00:33:20.242
I finished checking the electricity usage at 11am.

532
00:33:20.673 --> 00:33:23.083
I finished checking the gas usage at 3pm.

533
00:33:24.053 --> 00:33:26.853
Lastly, I fed the kitty with half the tuna can...

534
00:33:26.853 --> 00:33:28.553
and two cups of cat food.

535
00:33:30.153 --> 00:33:32.653
I found chicken breast that passed the expiration date in the fridge.

536
00:33:32.952 --> 00:33:34.992
I boiled it and gave it to the kitty as a snack.

537
00:33:54.813 --> 00:33:57.143
You must be feeling good.

538
00:34:04.252 --> 00:34:07.863
(By the way, what is its name?)

539
00:34:58.372 --> 00:34:59.812
Good morning to you too.

540
00:35:15.423 --> 00:35:16.863
I'd like to write a contract.

541
00:35:17.433 --> 00:35:19.133
How about lunch today?

542
00:35:28.602 --> 00:35:30.872
All right. Then I'll visit your office today.

543
00:35:35.642 --> 00:35:37.582
Did you decide on your roommate?

544
00:35:37.912 --> 00:35:39.553
I'm glad to hear that.

545
00:35:39.553 --> 00:35:42.622
Guys, have you seen this kind of CEO and company?

546
00:35:42.653 --> 00:35:45.852
I'm considerate enough to get a roommate for my employee.

547
00:35:46.093 --> 00:35:48.662
Not every CEO is like this.

548
00:35:48.662 --> 00:35:50.062
How do you know this person?

549
00:35:50.192 --> 00:35:53.792
He's a friend of my junior from the business club.

550
00:35:55.633 --> 00:35:57.772
Do you not like this person?

551
00:35:57.803 --> 00:36:00.872
You think he'll call the police again? Should I find someone else?

552
00:36:01.102 --> 00:36:03.942
No, I like him very much.

553
00:36:06.812 --> 00:36:08.283
Very much?

554
00:36:11.352 --> 00:36:14.653
Yes. I'm on my way to her office.

555
00:36:15.223 --> 00:36:16.522
She's busy, you know.

556
00:36:16.653 --> 00:36:18.493
That's good to hear.

557
00:36:18.953 --> 00:36:20.892
She's Ho Rang's friend,

558
00:36:21.162 --> 00:36:23.122
so she must be a nice person.

559
00:36:23.392 --> 00:36:24.462
Well...

560
00:36:25.732 --> 00:36:27.292
(I'd like to write a contract.)

561
00:36:27.292 --> 00:36:30.203
(And its name is Kitty.)

562
00:36:30.203 --> 00:36:32.332
I think she'll be fun to be with.

563
00:36:32.803 --> 00:36:36.442
Don't go empty-handed. Buy some snacks to give them.

564
00:36:36.473 --> 00:36:39.912
Don't worry. I'm going to buy some things for them anyway.

565
00:36:50.153 --> 00:36:52.223
He likes his roommate very much.

566
00:36:53.223 --> 00:36:56.662
I've never heard him use a "very" to people in my entire life.

567
00:36:56.662 --> 00:36:57.832
He does sometimes.

568
00:36:58.263 --> 00:37:00.493
Mr. Ma is very late today.

569
00:37:00.493 --> 00:37:02.332
Mr. Ma's jokes are very boring.

570
00:37:03.232 --> 00:37:06.272
Are you doing this to get people's attention?

571
00:37:06.272 --> 00:37:09.573
Or are you doing this to upset me?

572
00:37:09.573 --> 00:37:12.812
Why aren't our sandwiches coming? We ordered them a long time ago.

573
00:37:13.142 --> 00:37:16.613
I understand they're busy with deliveries, but they're always late.

574
00:37:16.743 --> 00:37:18.812
It might be faster for us to just go there.

575
00:37:19.013 --> 00:37:21.823
- It takes five minutes by foot. - You're too nice.

576
00:37:22.022 --> 00:37:23.252
Shall I go pick them up?

577
00:37:23.683 --> 00:37:25.792
- Yes. - Okay.

578
00:37:29.122 --> 00:37:30.993
- I'll be right back. - Hold on.

579
00:37:38.803 --> 00:37:40.033
Hello.

580
00:37:41.303 --> 00:37:43.473
Well... I'm...

581
00:37:46.113 --> 00:37:47.113
The kitty...

582
00:37:49.183 --> 00:37:50.683
Oh, this.

583
00:37:54.852 --> 00:37:57.522
How can you be this late? Lunchtime is almost over.

584
00:37:58.053 --> 00:37:59.993
Gosh, I'm sorry.

585
00:38:01.062 --> 00:38:02.923
I left as soon as I got the message.

586
00:38:02.923 --> 00:38:05.763
That's old-fashioned. Do you still give that as an excuse?

587
00:38:06.392 --> 00:38:08.033
I'm sorry.

588
00:38:10.203 --> 00:38:12.803
You look so young.

589
00:38:13.732 --> 00:38:14.843
We've never seen each other.

590
00:38:14.843 --> 00:38:17.343
Right, it's our first time in person.

591
00:38:17.812 --> 00:38:19.973
- Thank you. Give me those. - Here.

592
00:38:20.982 --> 00:38:24.312
I don't know how I should thank you.

593
00:38:24.582 --> 00:38:26.482
This is such a nice opportunity for me.

594
00:38:26.783 --> 00:38:28.223
This isn't that of an opportunity.

595
00:38:28.453 --> 00:38:30.423
It's a fair transaction of this capitalistic country.

596
00:38:30.723 --> 00:38:32.392
You're right.

597
00:38:33.252 --> 00:38:35.692
I hope we get along...

598
00:38:36.792 --> 00:38:37.792
from now on.

599
00:38:38.792 --> 00:38:40.832
- Can I call you by your name? - No.

600
00:38:43.462 --> 00:38:45.002
Okay, sorry.

601
00:38:46.033 --> 00:38:47.102
Bye.

602
00:38:47.573 --> 00:38:48.673
Well...

603
00:38:50.303 --> 00:38:52.812
Can we see each other later at night?

604
00:38:52.973 --> 00:38:54.783
Well, I'll think about it.

605
00:38:58.252 --> 00:39:00.412
Does she want us to order sandwiches for dinner again?

606
00:39:01.122 --> 00:39:02.982
She's great at promoting her place.

607
00:39:04.723 --> 00:39:07.792
I guess she doesn't like to be called by her name.

608
00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:14.433
- Excuse me. - Excuse me.

609
00:39:24.412 --> 00:39:26.872
(Yoon Ji Ho)

610
00:39:27.883 --> 00:39:29.513
- This is good. - It's delicious.

611
00:39:29.582 --> 00:39:32.053
- I'm having a sandwich at my age. -What's wrong with that?

612
00:39:36.183 --> 00:39:37.593
Stop eating. That's mine.

613
00:39:38.323 --> 00:39:40.453
Sir, come have lunch.

614
00:39:40.923 --> 00:39:41.993
It's sandwich.

615
00:39:42.593 --> 00:39:44.533
- Who put this here? - Well...

616
00:39:45.332 --> 00:39:46.493
I found it on this table.

617
00:39:46.863 --> 00:39:48.462
There's only one left.

618
00:39:49.933 --> 00:39:51.303
Did you read the contract papers?

619
00:39:52.232 --> 00:39:53.303
Yes.

620
00:39:54.272 --> 00:39:56.473
(Yes)

621
00:39:56.473 --> 00:39:59.243
I didn't get to tell you because you seemed a bit busy.

622
00:40:00.573 --> 00:40:03.312
I think I'll go home late today.

623
00:40:03.312 --> 00:40:09.153
(I think I'll go home late today, Se Hee.)

624
00:40:09.153 --> 00:40:14.562
(I think I'll go home late today.)

625
00:40:14.562 --> 00:40:17.593
You don't need to say those things to me.

626
00:40:18.593 --> 00:40:20.832
She's very nonchalant.

627
00:40:25.502 --> 00:40:27.642
Do you want the usual cut?

628
00:40:27.903 --> 00:40:31.712
No, please iron my hair today.

629
00:40:34.412 --> 00:40:36.783
Do you think I can do this hair?

630
00:40:37.553 --> 00:40:40.082
Are you going somewhere? Is it a blind date?

631
00:40:40.613 --> 00:40:43.053
No, it's not a blind date.

632
00:40:43.953 --> 00:40:47.423
Would you be able to trim my eyebrows too?

633
00:40:47.423 --> 00:40:49.062
I see.

634
00:40:53.232 --> 00:40:55.403
(I couldn't tell you because you seemed to be very busy.)

635
00:40:57.332 --> 00:40:59.403
(D-Day! Go, Arsenal!)

636
00:41:01.442 --> 00:41:02.442
Who is that?

637
00:41:05.173 --> 00:41:07.212
It's my new housemate.

638
00:41:07.212 --> 00:41:08.613
I guess he's into soccer a lot.

639
00:41:08.613 --> 00:41:10.752
Most guys are.

640
00:41:12.613 --> 00:41:14.183
I think that's enough.

641
00:41:19.323 --> 00:41:20.453
(Nice to meet you! I'm Ji Ho.)

642
00:41:20.453 --> 00:41:22.662
You like pink, don't you?

643
00:41:22.662 --> 00:41:25.033
I do. That's my signature color.

644
00:41:25.332 --> 00:41:29.502
Well, do guys prefer pink these days?

645
00:41:29.502 --> 00:41:32.633
You just don't know because you lack a sense of beauty.

646
00:41:32.633 --> 00:41:35.502
Pink is not a color that suits everyone.

647
00:41:36.272 --> 00:41:39.073
It suits me because I have the right skin tone for it.

648
00:41:39.173 --> 00:41:41.013
Are you saying guys shouldn't like pink?

649
00:41:41.743 --> 00:41:43.883
I'm so tired.

650
00:41:47.312 --> 00:41:48.852
What? Get back to work.

651
00:41:51.923 --> 00:41:53.453
Times have changed.

652
00:41:53.953 --> 00:41:55.723
There is no such thing as male and female preference.

653
00:41:57.192 --> 00:42:00.232
Okay. We are living in a progressive world.

654
00:42:00.232 --> 00:42:02.162
(Nice to meet you! I'm Ji Ho.)

655
00:42:03.562 --> 00:42:04.602
Excuse me!

656
00:42:04.602 --> 00:42:06.633
(The after-show party for The Love of Bing Gu)

657
00:42:06.633 --> 00:42:09.372
- Please give us soju. - Can we get one more, please?

658
00:42:10.343 --> 00:42:11.343
Ji Ho!

659
00:42:15.513 --> 00:42:16.582
Come over here.

660
00:42:17.712 --> 00:42:19.653
- Welcome. - Why are you so late?

661
00:42:19.653 --> 00:42:21.283
Have a seat.

662
00:42:21.283 --> 00:42:23.022
Your dress is fancy.

663
00:42:23.022 --> 00:42:25.493
You think you've been working long enough to afford coming late?

664
00:42:26.053 --> 00:42:29.522
Can an assistant writer be late for the after-show party?

665
00:42:29.522 --> 00:42:32.763
Look what he's doing. He's doing it again.

666
00:42:32.763 --> 00:42:36.732
You stopped everyone from sitting next to you saying it was for Ji Ho.

667
00:42:37.133 --> 00:42:38.232
Really?

668
00:42:39.332 --> 00:42:41.602
- You missed me, didn't you? - When did I do that?

669
00:42:42.442 --> 00:42:44.673
It's because I feel hot easily.

670
00:42:44.673 --> 00:42:46.812
That's why emptied here.

671
00:42:46.812 --> 00:42:49.812
Oh, my goodness. I hate to see you guys now.

672
00:42:49.812 --> 00:42:52.053
You can date or sleep with each other. I don't care.

673
00:42:52.053 --> 00:42:53.553
Just do whatever you want.

674
00:42:54.153 --> 00:42:55.823
You guys have been flirting for three years.

675
00:42:56.653 --> 00:42:58.153
Who is playing hard to get now?

676
00:42:58.153 --> 00:43:00.022
It's nothing like that.

677
00:43:00.022 --> 00:43:01.223
Who do you think it is?

678
00:43:02.093 --> 00:43:03.522
It's not me.

679
00:43:04.033 --> 00:43:05.162
What are you doing?

680
00:43:09.303 --> 00:43:12.973
Does that mean Ji Ho's not interested in him?

681
00:43:13.732 --> 00:43:15.903
Why? What's wrong with Yong Suk?

682
00:43:15.903 --> 00:43:17.712
What are you talking about?

683
00:43:17.712 --> 00:43:20.013
He's not a man to me.

684
00:43:20.013 --> 00:43:21.883
We are brothers.

685
00:43:21.883 --> 00:43:25.312
I've been taking care of this innocent baby for three years.

686
00:43:26.212 --> 00:43:29.953
I think she means that. She really is not interested in you.

687
00:43:29.953 --> 00:43:32.252
That actually hurt my self-esteem.

688
00:43:33.153 --> 00:43:36.493
I can always make you fall for me.

689
00:43:36.493 --> 00:43:37.533
Really?

690
00:43:38.263 --> 00:43:41.062
Then you'd better not pass out before I do today.

691
00:43:41.062 --> 00:43:42.732
- Do you really want to do that? - Right, let's do this.

692
00:43:42.732 --> 00:43:44.473
Let's drink.

693
00:43:44.473 --> 00:43:46.533
- Cheers! - Cheers.

694
00:43:47.872 --> 00:43:49.243
Thank you for your work.

695
00:44:02.982 --> 00:44:04.823
- What about flash? - It's working.

696
00:44:04.823 --> 00:44:07.252
Okay. What about the closing problem when logging in?

697
00:44:07.252 --> 00:44:08.423
I fixed the bug.

698
00:44:08.423 --> 00:44:10.423
Is there any problem for uploading profiles and videos?

699
00:44:10.423 --> 00:44:12.033
It's working.

700
00:44:12.033 --> 00:44:13.133
Good job.

701
00:44:15.433 --> 00:44:19.133
Gyeol Mal Ae's update, ver 2.0.

702
00:44:21.203 --> 00:44:23.673
(It's updating. Please wait.)

703
00:44:23.673 --> 00:44:24.673
(The update is completed.)

704
00:44:24.673 --> 00:44:25.772
It's completed.

705
00:44:27.482 --> 00:44:28.642
We did it!

706
00:44:29.982 --> 00:44:33.183
For the last three weeks, you worked day and night...

707
00:44:33.183 --> 00:44:35.653
for the new update for Gyeol Mal Ae.

708
00:44:36.423 --> 00:44:38.953
To thank you properly,

709
00:44:39.392 --> 00:44:42.022
I won't hesitate to pay you the year-end bonus!

710
00:44:46.633 --> 00:44:50.803
At first, Gyeol Mal Ae could only make 50 dollars of profit per month.

711
00:44:50.973 --> 00:44:54.142
I can't thank you guys enough...

712
00:44:54.142 --> 00:44:56.743
for making this company grow more than 200% every year.

713
00:44:57.843 --> 00:44:58.942
I can't even...

714
00:45:00.513 --> 00:45:01.712
I know it's a bit embarrassing,

715
00:45:02.412 --> 00:45:03.783
but let's shout our slogan.

716
00:45:04.212 --> 00:45:05.252
We are...

717
00:45:05.252 --> 00:45:06.312
- Not family! - Not family!

718
00:45:06.312 --> 00:45:07.423
- Let's get paid... - Properly!

719
00:45:07.423 --> 00:45:10.522
- Cheers! - Cheers!

720
00:45:11.053 --> 00:45:13.453
- Let's drink! - Drink away!

721
00:45:16.423 --> 00:45:19.392
My beer is hot. Why is it like this?

722
00:45:20.903 --> 00:45:23.732
I think you can get changed now.

723
00:45:25.303 --> 00:45:26.803
I already did.

724
00:45:28.903 --> 00:45:30.203
It was darker than this yesterday.

725
00:45:30.973 --> 00:45:32.312
It's a bit lighter today.

726
00:45:36.812 --> 00:45:37.812
I see.

727
00:45:41.022 --> 00:45:44.423
Do you think who we just saw? We saw Yoon So Hee!

728
00:45:44.423 --> 00:45:45.823
- Did you? - Really?

729
00:45:45.823 --> 00:45:47.122
- That's amazing! - Where?

730
00:45:47.122 --> 00:45:49.763
Yoon So Hee? Who is that?

731
00:45:54.533 --> 00:45:55.562
What?

732
00:45:56.062 --> 00:45:57.372
Is she one of our investors?

733
00:46:04.513 --> 00:46:05.613
That's right.

734
00:46:07.912 --> 00:46:08.942
Ms. Yoon.

735
00:46:12.153 --> 00:46:14.122
- Hi. - Hello.

736
00:46:14.783 --> 00:46:17.153
Thanks for your hard work.

737
00:46:17.153 --> 00:46:20.323
Don't worry about it. You did all the work.

738
00:46:20.323 --> 00:46:21.562
That's not true.

739
00:46:21.823 --> 00:46:24.292
Anyway, I should get going.

740
00:46:31.602 --> 00:46:33.573
That was smooth.

741
00:46:36.973 --> 00:46:38.312
I'm sorry, Ji Ho.

742
00:46:38.812 --> 00:46:41.542
You had to work more to cover things up for me.

743
00:46:41.542 --> 00:46:43.113
What's with you?

744
00:46:43.113 --> 00:46:45.553
You've never been grateful for it for the last three years.

745
00:46:45.553 --> 00:46:46.613
I know.

746
00:46:47.183 --> 00:46:49.923
We've known each other for three years already.

747
00:46:53.692 --> 00:46:56.323
Hey,

748
00:46:59.193 --> 00:47:01.564
I have something to tell you.

749
00:47:05.334 --> 00:47:06.363
Excuse me.

750
00:47:07.104 --> 00:47:08.934
I'm coming through.

751
00:47:09.006 --> 00:47:11.377
I have something to tell you.

752
00:47:15.085 --> 00:47:16.114
Excuse me.

753
00:47:16.855 --> 00:47:18.685
I'm coming through.

754
00:47:19.267 --> 00:47:20.596
- I see. - Okay.

755
00:47:26.636 --> 00:47:29.807
- I'm going for a walk. - Oh, okay.

756
00:47:30.877 --> 00:47:33.247
Be back soon.

757
00:47:48.696 --> 00:47:49.756
Oh, no!

758
00:47:52.167 --> 00:47:53.466
Sanchez...

759
00:47:59.236 --> 00:48:00.566
I'm sorry.

760
00:48:01.776 --> 00:48:03.977
I wanted to watch that game a lot.

761
00:48:10.446 --> 00:48:11.546
Shoot!

762
00:48:14.147 --> 00:48:15.156
That's amazing!

763
00:48:23.857 --> 00:48:25.167
Are you okay?

764
00:48:25.167 --> 00:48:27.366
I'm really sorry.

765
00:48:27.366 --> 00:48:29.497
It's because... I am...

766
00:48:31.267 --> 00:48:33.607
I mean, at the last game,

767
00:48:34.577 --> 00:48:37.176
when Sanchez scored the winning goal...

768
00:48:37.707 --> 00:48:39.477
the referee said it was offside.

769
00:48:40.046 --> 00:48:43.816
But it wasn't. I've watched that game more than three times.

770
00:48:45.046 --> 00:48:47.957
If that wasn't offside, Arsenal would have won that game.

771
00:48:49.457 --> 00:48:53.357
I'm not saying that Wenger's strategy was great, but...

772
00:48:59.366 --> 00:49:00.526
I'm sorry.

773
00:49:04.866 --> 00:49:05.866
Are you a fan of...

774
00:49:12.307 --> 00:49:13.406
Arsenal?

775
00:49:15.977 --> 00:49:18.486
Yoon Bo Mi, where is Nam Se Hee?

776
00:49:18.486 --> 00:49:21.116
Hey, the CEO is talking to you.

777
00:49:21.116 --> 00:49:23.287
- Oh, my goodness. - Oh, man!

778
00:49:23.386 --> 00:49:24.426
What was that?

779
00:49:24.727 --> 00:49:26.287
Mr. Park, have you seen Ms. Yoon?

780
00:49:26.827 --> 00:49:27.827
I haven't.

781
00:49:28.526 --> 00:49:29.526
Where did she go?

782
00:49:31.167 --> 00:49:32.926
If you think about it thoroughly,

783
00:49:32.926 --> 00:49:36.497
Arsenal placed 4th for 7 times after its debut in the Premier League.

784
00:49:36.636 --> 00:49:39.207
It's the same as Liverpool.

785
00:49:39.707 --> 00:49:41.506
Did you count it...

786
00:49:41.676 --> 00:49:44.377
I gathered statistics of their records by myself.

787
00:49:48.276 --> 00:49:50.917
Where are you? I'm outside.

788
00:49:51.417 --> 00:49:52.417
I'm at the parking lot.

789
00:49:59.156 --> 00:50:01.696
Go ahead. He must be your boyfriend.

790
00:50:02.296 --> 00:50:04.627
No, he's not my boyfriend.

791
00:50:06.566 --> 00:50:07.566
Not yet.

792
00:50:09.466 --> 00:50:12.937
We're getting to know each other.

793
00:50:14.377 --> 00:50:17.747
He almost asked me out just a while ago.

794
00:50:18.276 --> 00:50:20.107
But I became so nervous...

795
00:50:20.276 --> 00:50:21.917
and ran away to here.

796
00:50:22.676 --> 00:50:24.917
I was going to tell him my feelings first...

797
00:50:25.087 --> 00:50:27.087
if Arsenal won the match today.

798
00:50:30.216 --> 00:50:31.727
By the way...

799
00:50:34.357 --> 00:50:36.596
Why am I telling you all this...

800
00:50:37.997 --> 00:50:40.696
when you're a stranger?

801
00:50:41.196 --> 00:50:44.236
He's handsome and tall.

802
00:50:46.207 --> 00:50:48.577
Right? He's handsome, right?

803
00:50:48.676 --> 00:50:51.406
Yes, I should say he's...

804
00:50:54.616 --> 00:50:55.946
7 out of 10.

805
00:50:57.147 --> 00:50:58.417
That's too cheap.

806
00:50:58.986 --> 00:51:01.316
He's at least a nine.

807
00:51:03.957 --> 00:51:06.926
He's tall. He has thick eye brows.

808
00:51:07.327 --> 00:51:09.526
He's got broad shoulders. He has a job too.

809
00:51:12.167 --> 00:51:14.196
- Hey. - I missed you.

810
00:51:18.667 --> 00:51:19.837
And he has...

811
00:51:21.107 --> 00:51:22.136
a girlfriend too.

812
00:51:26.176 --> 00:51:28.377
- Goodness. - I missed you.

813
00:51:28.446 --> 00:51:33.187
- Goal! - Goal!

814
00:51:33.787 --> 00:51:36.587
Come to think of it,

815
00:51:36.716 --> 00:51:39.656
I've never been a striker in my life.

816
00:51:39.687 --> 00:51:41.096
Thank you.

817
00:51:41.457 --> 00:51:43.727
- Good job. - Don't mention it.

818
00:51:43.926 --> 00:51:45.767
- Thank you. - Ms. Yoon.

819
00:51:46.796 --> 00:51:48.296
Ms. Yoon, come sit here.

820
00:51:48.296 --> 00:51:51.037
- What? - Where did you go? I missed you.

821
00:51:51.236 --> 00:51:52.307
Me too.

822
00:51:52.937 --> 00:51:55.176
- Drink up. - Okay.

823
00:51:55.636 --> 00:51:58.077
- Let's work together again. - Thank you.

824
00:51:58.546 --> 00:51:59.647
Drink up.

825
00:51:59.776 --> 00:52:01.917
I've always defended myself...

826
00:52:02.216 --> 00:52:04.116
and stepped back at a right timing.

827
00:52:08.057 --> 00:52:12.457
(I'm dating someone. I wanted to tell you this a while ago.)

828
00:52:14.196 --> 00:52:16.296
I have neither courage to take the ball...

829
00:52:16.857 --> 00:52:19.296
nor experience to avoid it.

830
00:52:19.596 --> 00:52:22.167
I'm an amateur defender.

831
00:52:22.167 --> 00:52:25.337
(Really? Awesome! Congratulations.)

832
00:52:32.707 --> 00:52:33.776
Mr. Ma.

833
00:52:34.006 --> 00:52:36.377
Are you aware this is power abuse?

834
00:52:37.176 --> 00:52:39.787
We agreed for me to join only the first part of the team dinner.

835
00:52:39.846 --> 00:52:42.656
I'll take you home then. I'll call a designated driver.

836
00:52:42.656 --> 00:52:44.357
Forget it. I'll take the bus.

837
00:52:44.886 --> 00:52:46.886
Taking a bus is way faster than taking your car.

838
00:52:48.096 --> 00:52:50.596
I told you I'll take a bus.

839
00:52:52.886 --> 00:52:54.886
Taking a bus is way faster than taking your car.

840
00:52:56.096 --> 00:52:58.596
I told you I'll take a bus.

841
00:53:01.008 --> 00:53:03.478
Right, there's a subway too.

842
00:53:04.818 --> 00:53:06.179
Take the bus.

843
00:53:11.559 --> 00:53:15.088
Can't you just go home by bus?

844
00:53:17.628 --> 00:53:19.858
I think that'll make me feel less embarrassed.

845
00:53:24.139 --> 00:53:25.199
Well...

846
00:53:36.508 --> 00:53:38.378
Are you sure it'll make you less embarrassed?

847
00:53:39.619 --> 00:53:40.619
No.

848
00:53:42.918 --> 00:53:44.559
This is my first time in this neighborhood.

849
00:53:45.559 --> 00:53:48.258
I don't go out often, and I hate going outside at night.

850
00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:50.559
I'm either at home or my workplace.

851
00:53:50.929 --> 00:53:54.829
So we'll never see each other again.

852
00:53:56.499 --> 00:53:58.699
I have to wait at least 10 more minutes until the bus comes.

853
00:53:59.139 --> 00:54:01.309
There's no need to stay uncomfortable like this.

854
00:54:01.838 --> 00:54:04.039
You don't have to feel embarrassed anymore.

855
00:54:08.548 --> 00:54:09.679
I'm embarrassed...

856
00:54:11.378 --> 00:54:12.818
by myself.

857
00:54:14.949 --> 00:54:17.318
Not you, but myself.

858
00:54:18.958 --> 00:54:22.258
I couldn't differentiate love from kindness until this age.

859
00:54:24.128 --> 00:54:27.869
I had a crush on him for three years.

860
00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.898
I kept it until I turned 30.

861
00:54:32.539 --> 00:54:35.568
I'm ashamed by how foolish I am.

862
00:54:37.608 --> 00:54:39.208
I'm not even 20, but 30.

863
00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:43.349
I don't know what I'm doing at my age of 30.

864
00:54:47.489 --> 00:54:49.219
That's why,

865
00:54:50.889 --> 00:54:52.659
so don't be bothered by it.

866
00:54:54.628 --> 00:54:58.228
You mentioned your age, 30, in your short comment.

867
00:54:59.358 --> 00:55:00.969
It's the limit of your neocortex.

868
00:55:02.528 --> 00:55:03.528
Pardon?

869
00:55:04.599 --> 00:55:08.208
The neocortex is located at the outer part of your brain,

870
00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:10.469
and it's in charge of the concept of time like the age of 20 or 30.

871
00:55:11.108 --> 00:55:13.438
Cats don't have a neocortex unlike humans.

872
00:55:13.608 --> 00:55:15.478
So they don't get bored or depressed...

873
00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:18.119
even if they have the same food and do the same thing...

874
00:55:18.318 --> 00:55:20.119
in their same house in their daily lives.

875
00:55:20.989 --> 00:55:24.659
Cats have neither a future nor a past.

876
00:55:26.059 --> 00:55:29.329
"I'm 20. I'm 30. I'm turning 40 soon."

877
00:55:30.088 --> 00:55:33.999
Only one kind of species on Earth locks themselves up in time.

878
00:55:34.329 --> 00:55:36.168
They're human-beings.

879
00:55:36.999 --> 00:55:40.239
Only human-beings use age to make others spend money...

880
00:55:40.369 --> 00:55:42.168
and draw their emotions.

881
00:55:43.769 --> 00:55:47.548
That's what humans got in exchange for evolution.

882
00:55:52.648 --> 00:55:54.119
Whether they're 30 or 40,

883
00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:57.688
it's the same today for cats.

884
00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.128
That felt strange.

885
00:56:03.588 --> 00:56:04.999
His nonsense...

886
00:56:05.499 --> 00:56:08.898
comforted me more than anything else that day.

887
00:56:13.298 --> 00:56:14.309
Well...

888
00:56:16.508 --> 00:56:18.108
What is your name?

889
00:56:22.548 --> 00:56:25.548
Would it be better that I don't know your name?

890
00:56:25.818 --> 00:56:26.818
Yes.

891
00:56:28.048 --> 00:56:29.088
Okay.

892
00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:34.258
You're a total stranger,

893
00:56:35.728 --> 00:56:37.458
but I got comforted by you.

894
00:56:39.499 --> 00:56:42.769
You must've gotten comforted because I'm a total stranger.

895
00:56:45.338 --> 00:56:47.909
Thinking that I'd never see him again,

896
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:50.708
I felt a bit sad.

897
00:56:51.938 --> 00:56:55.079
Thank you for your neocortex story.

898
00:56:57.079 --> 00:56:59.978
I think I've already become a failure in this life,

899
00:57:01.249 --> 00:57:02.818
but I'll try my best.

900
00:57:08.858 --> 00:57:10.088
Good luck.

901
00:57:10.458 --> 00:57:13.758
Going through this life is the first time for all of us anyway.

902
00:57:16.628 --> 00:57:18.298
I've forgotten for a while.

903
00:57:21.338 --> 00:57:22.708
This life...

904
00:57:24.139 --> 00:57:25.508
This moment...

905
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:33.949
You only get one chance.

906
00:58:07.918 --> 00:58:09.418
It was such a long day.

907
00:58:12.918 --> 00:58:15.329
I moved out from a house which I lived for five years.

908
00:58:16.829 --> 00:58:19.499
I got friend-zoned after three years.

909
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:23.869
I kissed a total stranger.

910
00:58:24.239 --> 00:58:25.438
Way to go,

911
00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:27.469
Yoon Ji Ho.

912
00:58:59.699 --> 00:59:02.239
This is not how I imagined I'd be living in my 30s,

913
00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:05.139
but considering it being my first time,

914
00:59:05.978 --> 00:59:07.378
it's not so bad.

915
00:59:12.719 --> 00:59:15.418
Like what he told me,

916
00:59:17.148 --> 00:59:19.519
we are all living this life...

917
00:59:20.019 --> 00:59:21.429
for the first time.

918
00:59:41.179 --> 00:59:44.679
(Because This Is My First Life)

919
00:59:45.179 --> 00:59:47.318
Why don't you just live with her if she scored so high?

920
00:59:47.749 --> 00:59:49.249
Is this score possible?

921
00:59:50.389 --> 00:59:52.358
Does that man live here?

922
00:59:52.918 --> 00:59:55.028
How did you come in here?

923
00:59:55.028 --> 00:59:56.789
Why do all housemates...

924
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:58.298
Are you asking if the owner is a male?

925
01:00:01.969 --> 01:00:03.568
Let's pretend I didn't hear it.

926
01:00:04.469 --> 01:00:06.099
Did that jerk hit on you?

927
01:00:06.568 --> 01:00:09.409
- This is my son's place. - Sorry?

928
01:00:09.909 --> 01:00:11.208
Gosh, I can't hear anything.

929
01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:15.778
This is the only place I can sleep tonight.

930
01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:17.778
I'm sorry.

931
01:00:18.019 --> 01:00:20.789
And you kicked me out of this place, do you know that?
