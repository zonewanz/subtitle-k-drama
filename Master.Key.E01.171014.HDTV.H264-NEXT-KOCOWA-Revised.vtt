Master Key that can open anything.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.199
do you think you can handle it?

6
00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:32.432
Is anyone here?

(Who is the first player that
arrives at the safe house?)

16
00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:03.162
It looks great. Hello.

17
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:04.721
Please be careful.

(Jun Hyun Moo was accepted at three
broadcasting stations. He is smart.)

23
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.312
Be quick. You will feel awkward.

24
00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:22.611
You have to keep your hands down
and walk on the red carpet.

25

- Everyone came prepared.
- Look at his pants.

26
00:01:25.312 --> 00:01:27.982
I could tell that he is Jong Min

Hey, Jong Min.

28

You're right. We're fools.

31
00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:37.822
Someone is coming.

32
00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:39.792
- Who is it?
- There are some...

33
00:01:40.092 --> 00:01:41.292
He looks like a fool like us.

34
00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:44.202
- Why is he walking like that?
- He doesn't look like a fool.

35
00:01:44.232 --> 00:01:46.131
But he thinks like Jong Min.

36
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:49.242

- I like it here too.
- I like the red carpet.

41
00:01:56.842 --> 00:01:59.682
- Red carpet.
- Since we are four guys here,

42
00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:02.051
- there might be a female guest.
- There is another guest.

43
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.682
My expectation is high.

44
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.822

- He looks handsome.
- We should...

55
00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:31.041
Don't you feel awkward
without other members today?

56
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:33.552
I feel awkward that I'm alone
on this show.

57
00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:35.381
He's used to doing everything
with other members.

58
00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:37.721
I'm sure five of us can...

59

- make the show entertaining.
- You're right.

60

We're not bad.

61

Someone is here.

62
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:45.832
Who is it?

63
00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:48.531
Is five of us enough for the show?

64
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:50.432
- There are two people.
- Really?

65
00:02:50.432 --> 00:02:52.302
- Who are they?
- Who are they? They are tall.

66
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:54.231
- They look so handsome.
- It seems full enough here.

67

- Aren't they...
- It looks like an award ceremony.

68
00:02:55.902 --> 00:02:58.742
- The ones who sang "Pick Me".
- They are here.

69
00:02:58.772 --> 00:03:01.541
If there are only two of them,
they must be Untitle.

70

- What are you talking about?
- He is so old.

71

They greet properly.

74
00:03:09.052 --> 00:03:10.122
This is great.

75
00:03:11.552 --> 00:03:12.821
I was right.

76
00:03:13.191 --> 00:03:15.622

(A popular guy's scent)

85
00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.812
- 8 years?
- There is a female guest finally.

86
00:03:39.812 --> 00:03:42.251
You are right.

87
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:44.881
- She is wearing a dress.
- She's beautiful.

88

Everyone welcomes her differently.

92
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:56.832
She is so beautiful.

93

- Can you see her?
- She's so far away.

94

- I can see her.

95
00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:03.571

98
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:11.541
- Thank you.
- Why didn't you stand next to them?

99
00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:13.011
Did you feel shy to
stand next to those guys?

100
00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:14.251
Yes, a little.

101
00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:16.552

It felt like we were really walking
on a red carpet.

104
00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:23.191
We could have just walked in a line.

105
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:24.992
- Right?
- There is a sexy guest.

106

- A sexy guest?
- Is there another guest?

107
00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:28.532
- You find the male guest sexy?
- He looks good.

108
00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:31.662
It's cold today,
and his shirt is open.

109
00:04:32.432 --> 00:04:33.472
Jin Young!

110
00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:35.771

- Hello.
- He's wearing a skin-toned T-shirt.

113
00:04:41.542 --> 00:04:43.011
It wasn't his chest.

114
00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:45.651
- I'm sorry.
- I thought it was his chest.

115
00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:48.821
- I was confused.
- Right.

116
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.651
I haven't seen a turtleneck
sweater in a while.

117
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:52.321
I'm sorry.

118

131
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:25.122
Thanks to Hyun Moo,

00:05:25.122 --> 00:05:27.492
- I'm glad Su Geun is here too.

133
00:05:27.492 --> 00:05:29.662
- Hey.
- Don't you dare laugh at us.

134
00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:33.631
If we ask people to vote for the
ugliest, you will be the one.

135
00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:36.032
You have to stand here with us.

136
00:05:36.032 --> 00:05:37.631
- He is so handsome.
- He is so ugly.

137
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:39.372
This is crazy. What do we do?

138
00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:41.001
They look so handsome.

139
00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:43.802
There is another ugly player coming.

140
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:47.271
(A mudfish looking, Park Sung Kwang)

141
00:05:47.271 --> 00:05:49.312
(He is good at imitating
a drunk person.)

142
00:05:49.312 --> 00:05:51.282
- Sung Kwang!
- He's here.

143
00:05:51.282 --> 00:05:53.112

- Hello.

00:06:00.122 --> 00:06:01.691
We look similar.

148
00:06:03.521 --> 00:06:06.562
It's not nice to ask him
to stand next to Eun Woo.

149
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:07.992
He looks ugly next to him.

150
00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:10.701
Sung Kwang tried so hard
to look nice today.

151
00:06:11.461 --> 00:06:13.001
- Someone else is here.
- Is there another player?

152
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:14.901
- Really?
- This is the last player.

153
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:17.641
Who is the final player?

154
00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:20.341
(Cho Bo Ah is sweet and fresh.)

155
00:06:20.341 --> 00:06:21.812
- She is the final player.
- Really?

156
00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:22.912
Hello.

157
00:06:22.912 --> 00:06:25.552
If she is the final player...

158
00:06:25.612 --> 00:06:28.982
We might do s special game.

159
00:06:28.982 --> 00:06:32.122
(A beautiful player is here.)

160
00:06:34.122 --> 00:06:35.222
She is so pretty.

161
00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:37.591
You can't even see how she looks.

162
00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:39.792
- I can't even see her face yet.
- I can't see how she looks.

163
00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:41.562
- I don't see how she looks like.
- He just likes her already.

164
00:06:41.562 --> 00:06:43.932
- He likes all the girls.
- Hello.

165
00:06:43.932 --> 00:06:45.932
I can't see how she looks like.

166
00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:47.302
It's Bo Ah.

167
00:06:47.302 --> 00:06:48.571
Bo Ah is here.

168
00:06:48.571 --> 00:06:51.001
- Hello.
- Everyone looks so interested.

169
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:52.641
(All the guys are interested
in her.)

170
00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:55.242
- Nice to meet you.
- Bo Ah is here.

171
00:06:55.242 --> 00:06:56.581
- Hello.
- Hello.

172
00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:57.711
Hello.

173
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:59.312
- Stand over here.
- How do we stand in order?

174
00:06:59.312 --> 00:07:01.251
- Please stand here.
- Come this side.

175
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:03.922
You can stand next to the people
you feel the most comfortable.

176
00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:05.391
- You can choose.
- Have a look.

177
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.521
- Someone I feel comfortable with?
- Yes.

178
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:09.321
I'm sure anyone would feel
the most comfortable to stand here.

179
00:07:09.722 --> 00:07:10.821
(She stands next to them
to protect herself.)

180
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:12.591
What are you talking about? Don't
you feel uncomfortable next to us?

181
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:13.862
We can't do anything about it.

182
00:07:13.862 --> 00:07:15.461
Why don't you feel uncomfortable
next to us?

183
00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:19.071
Our show is the talk of the town
because of these players.

184
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.001
We're the members of Master Key.

185
00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:22.441
(Welcome to Master Key.)

186
00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.571
- Nice to meet you all.
- Nice to meet you.

187
00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:29.081
Let's introduce ourselves.

188
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.982
Hello. I want to be your star.

189
00:07:30.982 --> 00:07:33.081
I'm Cha Eun Woo of Astro.

190
00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:37.651
I'm the leader of B1A4, Jin Young.

191
00:07:37.651 --> 00:07:38.651
- Hello.
- Jin Young.

192
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:40.922
All I want to do, Wanna One.

193
00:07:40.922 --> 00:07:42.761
Hello. I'm Kang Daniel of Wanna One.

194
00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:43.922
Nice to meet you all.

195
00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:46.792
All I want to do, Wanna One.

196
00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:48.391
Hello. I'm Ong Seong Wu
of Wanna One.

197
00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:49.831
Nice to meet you all.

198
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:53.071
I'm Ong Seong Wu, not Hong Seong Wu.

199
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:55.242
I'm Ong Seong Wu,
not Woong Seong Wu.

200
00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:57.302
I'm Ong Seong Wu, not Kong Seong Wu.

201
00:07:57.302 --> 00:08:00.372
Ong is a very rare surname.

202
00:08:00.372 --> 00:08:01.881
He must be the first celebrity of
the Ong family.

203
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.141
It's a unique surname.

204
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:04.682
I heard about Ongsimi.

205
00:08:04.682 --> 00:08:05.852
- Ongsimi?
- What?

206
00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.581
Ongsimi is from Gangwon Province.

207
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.821
It's a name of food.

208
00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:10.251
He is talking about Ongsimi.

209
00:08:11.182 --> 00:08:12.191
It's not a name of person.

210
00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.852
That's the only thing I know.

211
00:08:13.852 --> 00:08:16.792
Jong Min will be criticized from
Wanna One's fans.

212
00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:19.492
(He will be the one
to get criticized.)

213
00:08:19.691 --> 00:08:22.362
- It was a bad joke.
- I'm sorry.

214
00:08:22.362 --> 00:08:23.461
We are one.

215
00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.932
Hello. I'm Baek Hyun.
I have the power of light.

216
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:28.602
He has a power.

217
00:08:28.602 --> 00:08:31.042
- The power of light.
- He's embarrassed.

218
00:08:31.042 --> 00:08:32.211
The power of light.

219
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:35.841
It's funny to say that I have the
power of light in the early morning.

220
00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:38.312
The director of lighting is
in charge of the lighting here.

221
00:08:38.312 --> 00:08:41.081
A lot of directors have that power.

222
00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:42.682
He's a popular idol.

223
00:08:42.682 --> 00:08:46.052
Hello. Nice to meet you all.
I'm Kang Han Na.

224
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:49.621
I like your dimple.

225
00:08:49.621 --> 00:08:50.892
- He keeps talking about appearance.
- Why do you keep...

226
00:08:50.892 --> 00:08:52.361
whispering in her ears?

227
00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:55.502
- "I like your dimple."
- "I like your dimple."

228
00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:56.632
(Don't you like her dimple?)

229
00:08:57.032 --> 00:09:00.432
I recently did a drama called
"Moon Lovers" with Baek Hyun.

230
00:09:00.432 --> 00:09:02.672
I did the drama with Baek Hyun.

231
00:09:02.672 --> 00:09:04.142
You guys must be close then.

232
00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:05.512
We're quite close.

233
00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:07.412
Yes. It was fun to work with her.

234
00:09:07.412 --> 00:09:08.841
Hello.

235
00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:12.981
I'm Cho Bo Ah, and I'm currently
in the drama, "Temperature of Love".

236
00:09:14.052 --> 00:09:16.422
Is there anyone that make you...

237
00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:19.121
quite uncomfortable?

238
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:21.591
(Staring)

239
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:23.262
No. There isn't anyone.

240
00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.062
She just looked at me.

241
00:09:25.792 --> 00:09:29.062
- You just looked at me.
- No.

242
00:09:29.062 --> 00:09:31.772
You just looked at me.

243
00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:34.101
Sung Kwang,
don't point your fingers at her.

244
00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:36.701
It's my habit.

245
00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.642
Could you please stand
on the carpet?

246
00:09:39.642 --> 00:09:40.941
I can't see anything from here.

247
00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:42.841
You will be eliminated
if you don't stand on the carpet.

248
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:43.941
(They finished getting to know
all 12 players.)

249
00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:45.611
What are we doing today?

250
00:09:45.611 --> 00:09:48.752
Do you all know what kind of
show this is?

251
00:09:48.752 --> 00:09:50.922
- I have no idea.
- Not a clue.

252
00:09:50.922 --> 00:09:54.621
This show is to open
every viewer's hearts...

253
00:09:54.621 --> 00:09:56.361
with Master Key.

254
00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:58.162
We will have to push the ratings
to the top.

255
00:09:58.162 --> 00:09:59.932
- He's so boring.
- From this early morning?

256
00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.292
- He's that age.
- Was my comment old-fashioned?

257
00:10:01.292 --> 00:10:03.532
Bo Ah even clapped for me.

258
00:10:03.532 --> 00:10:06.002
- Did you like what I said?
- Yes. I liked it a lot.

259
00:10:06.002 --> 00:10:08.302
(She made his boring speech funny.)

260
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:11.071
How old are you, Bo Ah?

261
00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:13.971
What are you asking?

262
00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:16.412
- I don't know how old she is.
- This is not a dating show.

263
00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:17.912
What are you doing?

264
00:10:18.782 --> 00:10:19.912
- Gosh.
- Oh no.

265
00:10:19.912 --> 00:10:21.752
This was the speaker.

266
00:10:21.752 --> 00:10:24.321
(Where is this mysterious sound
of bell coming from?)

267
00:10:25.052 --> 00:10:26.292
Gosh. I was so surprised.

268
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.591
Welcome to Master Village.

269
00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:34.292
I will be your guide at
Master Village. I'm Key Man.

270
00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:36.731
- This is going to be fun.
- Key Man?

271
00:10:37.062 --> 00:10:38.701
- Key Man.
- Key Man.

272
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:39.701
- Key Man.
- Key Man.

273
00:10:39.701 --> 00:10:41.302
This Master Village is
a secret place...

274
00:10:41.302 --> 00:10:44.172
where only invited players
are allowed to participate...

275
00:10:44.172 --> 00:10:47.611
in a secret game.

276
00:10:47.912 --> 00:10:51.441
You are qualified to participate
in the game...

277
00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:56.422
which offers amazing prizes and
cash prizes.

278
00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:59.351
Would you like to participate?

279
00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:00.522
- Yes.
- Yes.

280
00:11:00.522 --> 00:11:02.292
It will be funny if we say no.

281
00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:05.162
There is one thing that you need
to prepare...

282
00:11:05.162 --> 00:11:08.461
to participate in a game
at Master Village.

283
00:11:08.562 --> 00:11:11.002
It's the key.

284
00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:13.831
In this Master Village,

285
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:15.941
there are hidden 12 keys...

286
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.812
that allow you to enter
Room of Fate.

287
00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:19.912
- 12 keys.
- 12 keys.

288
00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:23.711
Each player needs to find the key
now...

289
00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:27.282
and enter Room of Fate.

290
00:11:27.652 --> 00:11:30.481
Players, now you can start.

291
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:32.351
- Now?
- Now?

292
00:11:32.351 --> 00:11:34.591
Don't find 2 keys, just 1.

293
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:36.562
- It's a treasure hunt.
- Keys are around here.

294
00:11:36.562 --> 00:11:37.721
They are around us.

295
00:11:37.721 --> 00:11:39.532
- It's a treasure hunt.
- It is.

296
00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.662
Where are you going?

297
00:11:40.662 --> 00:11:42.961
It's a competition now.

298
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:44.302
Can we start looking
for the key now?

299
00:11:44.302 --> 00:11:45.601
There are 12 of them.

300
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:46.731
Can I start now?

301
00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:48.272
- What's going on?
- This way.

302
00:11:48.272 --> 00:11:49.542
What's going on?

303
00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:51.812
Someone gave me a hint.

304
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:55.211
(He found the key.)

305
00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:58.611
- I found it.
- Do we need the key for the room?

306
00:11:58.981 --> 00:12:00.351
I found it.

307
00:12:01.611 --> 00:12:03.981
- I found it.
- Can you show me how it looks like?

308
00:12:04.081 --> 00:12:06.652
It's just a key. I found one.

309
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:08.591
I found the key first.

310
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:09.922
Oh, the key looks like that.

311
00:12:09.922 --> 00:12:11.461
It looks pretty.

312
00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:14.231
I found one as well.

313
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:16.432
I knew it.

314
00:12:16.701 --> 00:12:18.231
I knew it would be in the grass.

315
00:12:19.432 --> 00:12:20.831
I also found it.

316
00:12:21.172 --> 00:12:22.571
It looks pretty.

317
00:12:22.971 --> 00:12:25.371
I can't see well. It's so dark.

318
00:12:25.371 --> 00:12:26.542
Do you need the light?

319
00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:28.812
I should call Baek Hyun
when I need the light.

320
00:12:28.812 --> 00:12:30.412
- We need light.
- It's so dark.

321
00:12:30.412 --> 00:12:32.451
- I'm sorry.
- When I find it...

322
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.081
Room of Fate...

323
00:12:34.081 --> 00:12:35.552
I found one.

324
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:39.052
(Players start to find
their keys to Room of Fate.)

325
00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:41.991
Those with no keys,
continue searching.

326
00:12:46.262 --> 00:12:47.392
I'm doomed.

327
00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:51.502
What if I don't find one?

328
00:12:53.302 --> 00:12:54.601
What do I do?

329
00:12:55.142 --> 00:12:57.142
What are you doing, Seong Wu?

330
00:12:57.142 --> 00:12:59.241
- You found one earlier.
- Yes.

331
00:12:59.241 --> 00:13:01.371
You should help me then.

332
00:13:01.412 --> 00:13:02.812
I will help you.

333
00:13:02.812 --> 00:13:04.542
I think I should.

334
00:13:04.542 --> 00:13:05.682
(He starts helping Seong Wu.)

335
00:13:05.682 --> 00:13:06.912
What do we do?

336
00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:09.821
The key might be at the back.

337
00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:11.382
I'm not good at this.

338
00:13:12.152 --> 00:13:16.022
When I was at school,
I used to find all the treasure.

339
00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:18.191
Oh, wait. It's here.

340
00:13:20.331 --> 00:13:22.932
I'm good at this.
I think it's this way.

341
00:13:22.932 --> 00:13:25.871
(He is the expert of treasure hunt.)

342
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:27.432
Jin Young.

343
00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:30.502
Keys are in secluded areas.

344
00:13:30.542 --> 00:13:31.672
Are you guys helping him?

345
00:13:31.672 --> 00:13:33.312
- Yes.
- Yes.

346
00:13:33.542 --> 00:13:35.941
- You will be successful one day.
- Gosh. No.

347
00:13:36.042 --> 00:13:37.341
Give me your autograph.

348
00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:38.652
It will be at the back.

349
00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:39.851
Jin Young.

350
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:41.312
Did he call my name?

351
00:13:41.312 --> 00:13:42.951
(He is a generous guy from Busan.)

352
00:13:42.951 --> 00:13:44.382
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

353
00:13:44.922 --> 00:13:47.621
I like playing games fairly.

354
00:13:48.691 --> 00:13:50.892
Let's go to Room of Fate.

355
00:13:50.892 --> 00:13:53.792
Come. I think it's this way.

356
00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:55.101
Look at this.

357
00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:56.101
It looks so nice.

358
00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:57.632
It's amazing.

359
00:13:58.632 --> 00:13:59.632
This is Room of Fate.

360
00:13:59.632 --> 00:14:02.142
There are so many keys.

361
00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:03.971
- This is amazing.
- It's so nice.

362
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:05.241
Look at this.

363
00:14:05.241 --> 00:14:07.241
- This set looks amazing.
- It does.

364
00:14:07.241 --> 00:14:08.512
I think we need to use our
brains to solve the games.

365
00:14:08.512 --> 00:14:10.682
I think so too. This table is
where we stand.

366
00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:11.711
What is this place?
It looks amazing.

367
00:14:11.912 --> 00:14:12.912
This is incredible.

368
00:14:12.912 --> 00:14:14.752
- Don't be surprised.
- Come in!

369
00:14:15.012 --> 00:14:16.682
Everyone, come in,
and don't let it surprise you.

370
00:14:17.221 --> 00:14:19.792
- This is amazing.
- It has our names. Bo Ah, here.

371
00:14:19.851 --> 00:14:21.351
- Thank you.
- Isn't this nice?

372
00:14:21.392 --> 00:14:23.121
- Yes, this is so nice.
- It looks so cool in here.

373
00:14:23.792 --> 00:14:25.961
Hey, they didn't
a half-hearted job. See?

374
00:14:26.562 --> 00:14:28.162
- I get why they kept it a secret.
- Hey, Henry.

375
00:14:28.502 --> 00:14:30.762
- Yes?
- Oh, my. This is unbelievable.

376
00:14:30.762 --> 00:14:33.172
In a way, this looks quite grand.

377
00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:34.932
- What? What is this?
- Hey, it's spinning!

378
00:14:35.371 --> 00:14:37.002
- Hey, play us the music.
- Come in quickly.

379
00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:39.312
- Hurry.
- All right, everyone.

380
00:14:39.571 --> 00:14:43.711
Stand in front of the podium
that has your name.

381
00:14:44.042 --> 00:14:45.451
The doors are closing.
They are automatic.

382
00:14:45.682 --> 00:14:47.282
- We can't get out then?
- Seriously?

383
00:14:47.282 --> 00:14:51.522
You're in the Room of Fate
which will determine...

384
00:14:51.821 --> 00:14:54.152
the fate of your keys
in Master Village.

385
00:14:54.152 --> 00:14:57.191
- This sounds fun.
- I will now tell you...

386
00:14:57.422 --> 00:15:00.361
how the keys you're holding will...

387
00:15:00.392 --> 00:15:03.502
affect your fates on this show
in detail.

388
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:07.772
Please open the lid of the podium
placed in front of you.

389
00:15:08.101 --> 00:15:09.142
Please open it.

390
00:15:09.502 --> 00:15:11.502
- This is great. Something's inside.
- What is this?

391
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:13.172
- What's this?
- What?

392
00:15:13.172 --> 00:15:15.042
All right. So among 12 keys,

393
00:15:15.542 --> 00:15:18.912
there are only two Mastery Keys
that can open the prize box.

394
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:22.652
Only two keys among the keys
we have can open the box.

395
00:15:23.152 --> 00:15:25.951
We must accomplish missions
scattered throughout the Village.

396
00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:29.292
We have to guess two people who
have the Master Keys accurately.

397
00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:30.961
That's how we'll win
the prize money.

398
00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:33.632
The important thing is that whoever
has the Master Key must...

399
00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:36.101
- pretend he or she doesn't have it.
- That's right.

400
00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.432
- This is similar to the mafia game.
- Exactly.

401
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:41.672
Whoever has the Master Key
among us...

402
00:15:42.002 --> 00:15:44.601
- must keep that poker face.
- Right.

403
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:46.711
- Please tell us.
- Then the game already started...

404
00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:49.042
when we were looking for the keys.

405
00:15:49.042 --> 00:15:50.211
- If...
- Yes.

406
00:15:50.211 --> 00:15:51.211
- He's right.
- This sounds fun.

407
00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:53.211
- All right. What do we do next?
- Let's go!

408
00:15:53.412 --> 00:15:56.321
All right. Aren't you curious...

409
00:15:56.321 --> 00:15:58.522
whose keys are the Master Keys?

410
00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:02.321
I will inform you how to check
if your keys are...

411
00:16:02.321 --> 00:16:05.191
the Master Keys this very moment.

412
00:16:05.591 --> 00:16:09.701
First, place your keys
on the counter.

413
00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:13.532
"Is this key the Master Key?"

414
00:16:14.032 --> 00:16:15.341
Ask this question.

415
00:16:15.402 --> 00:16:18.071
When you do, the counter will
give you the answer.

416
00:16:18.571 --> 00:16:19.741
The first player.

417
00:16:20.341 --> 00:16:23.682
(You must find out your fate
with your own eyes.)

418
00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:27.111
(Who will be the first player
to check their fate of the key?)

419
00:16:27.912 --> 00:16:30.752
Mr. Jun Hyun Moo will...

420
00:16:31.022 --> 00:16:33.621
be the first one to check his key.

421
00:16:33.621 --> 00:16:34.851
All right, Hyun Moo. You can do it.

422
00:16:34.892 --> 00:16:36.792
- I'm bad at concealing my face.
- Hyun Moo.

423
00:16:37.022 --> 00:16:40.591
- Put your key and ask the question.
- "Is this key the Master Key?"

424
00:16:40.691 --> 00:16:42.861
I won't look. Just be careful
of your neighbor.

425
00:16:42.902 --> 00:16:45.062
You can cover the bottom
and only your face...

426
00:16:45.062 --> 00:16:46.331
- I won't look.
- I...

427
00:16:46.331 --> 00:16:47.672
Give it a try.

428
00:16:48.542 --> 00:16:50.941
Is this key the Master Key?

429
00:16:52.471 --> 00:16:53.772
He can't see it yet.

430
00:16:54.672 --> 00:16:56.841
- We have to see him from here.
- Not yet, not yet.

431
00:16:57.042 --> 00:16:58.481
- I'll stand next to Jong Min.
- I can't see.

432
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:00.111
- From a distance...
- I can do this instead.

433
00:17:01.252 --> 00:17:03.022
I can't see his face well.

434
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:04.682
He's really bad at acting.

435
00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:06.221
- I don't think it's the Key.
- Wait.

436
00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:08.392
Hey, stop.

437
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:10.891
(He puts on a mysterious smile.)

438
00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:14.792
(We got you!)

439
00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:16.131
I bet his key isn't it.

440
00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:18.802
I don't think it's the Master Key.
I can see your eyes getting red.

441
00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:20.732
- He doesn't have it.
- Hyun Moo.

442
00:17:20.772 --> 00:17:22.671
He looks like he's hiding something.

443
00:17:22.901 --> 00:17:24.101
I don't think he has it.

444
00:17:24.472 --> 00:17:25.972
All right. Henry.

445
00:17:26.071 --> 00:17:28.712
- Ask the question.
- His neighbors should come here.

446
00:17:28.782 --> 00:17:30.581
- Do I put it here?
- Place it on the counter.

447
00:17:30.782 --> 00:17:32.681
Is this key the Master Key?

448
00:17:36.581 --> 00:17:38.121
- I think his key is it.
- Is it not?

449
00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:40.192
- I think he has it.
- He has a weird look on his face.

450
00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.421
- I think he has the Master Key.
- It...

451
00:17:41.792 --> 00:17:43.562
- He doesn't have it.
- Wait, no.

452
00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:44.992
That's his house key.

453
00:17:46.631 --> 00:17:48.331
- He might be acting on purpose.
- He looks he's disappointed.

454
00:17:48.331 --> 00:17:49.732
- No way.
- Hyun Moo and Henry don't have it.

455
00:17:49.762 --> 00:17:51.772
- Look at his face.
- He's not acting.

456
00:17:51.772 --> 00:17:52.802
- You'll know once you ask it.
- He's doing that on purpose.

457
00:17:52.802 --> 00:17:54.571
He's exaggerating.
He doesn't have it.

458
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:56.371
- He's exaggerating his gesture.
- Yes!

459
00:17:58.242 --> 00:17:59.671
I'm so certain you don't have it.

460
00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.012
- Su Geun.
- I'm sure you don't have it.

461
00:18:01.012 --> 00:18:02.641
I can exclude you with confidence.

462
00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:04.942
- That might be his play.
- He seems disappointed.

463
00:18:04.942 --> 00:18:06.911
You all should make
your own judgment. Baek Hyun.

464
00:18:06.911 --> 00:18:08.012
Goodness.

465
00:18:08.012 --> 00:18:10.081
Is this key the Master Key?

466
00:18:10.151 --> 00:18:12.821
- I'm nervous for him.
- Check if his eyes are shaking.

467
00:18:13.022 --> 00:18:14.192
We must study his face closely.

468
00:18:14.222 --> 00:18:15.992
- When people lie...
- His hair is covering his eyes.

469
00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:17.792
Wait. There's nothing...

470
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:20.391
- Wait. Hold on.
- What was that line?

471
00:18:20.492 --> 00:18:21.802
His facial expression is
so mysterious.

472
00:18:21.861 --> 00:18:23.562
- He doesn't show any expressions.
- That...

473
00:18:23.562 --> 00:18:26.071
- What's up with your mouth?
- He smiled out of nowhere.

474
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:27.202
- What's up with that?
- That was sudden.

475
00:18:27.202 --> 00:18:29.371
- Hey, stop acting.
- No, I'm not acting.

476
00:18:29.802 --> 00:18:31.401
- All right.
- Why did you smile suddenly?

477
00:18:31.442 --> 00:18:33.042
Is this key the Master Key?

478
00:18:33.611 --> 00:18:34.911
All right. With the expression
he has on now...

479
00:18:34.942 --> 00:18:38.181
We might've spotted him when he
tried acting in a situation as this.

480
00:18:38.381 --> 00:18:39.651
- Seong Wu.
- I can't read his face.

481
00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:42.552
But it's so hard to figure someone
out by just reading the face.

482
00:18:45.921 --> 00:18:47.492
- What is it?
- Show us your face.

483
00:18:47.522 --> 00:18:48.722
- Let us see your face.
- Look at his eyes.

484
00:18:49.121 --> 00:18:50.222
What is it?

485
00:18:50.222 --> 00:18:51.321
(Smiling)

486
00:18:52.361 --> 00:18:54.131
- He's good at acting.
- No, he can't act.

487
00:18:54.131 --> 00:18:56.032
- What an actor.
- This is fun.

488
00:18:56.032 --> 00:18:57.401
(What does his smile mean?)

489
00:18:57.931 --> 00:18:59.171
I think he has something to hide.

490
00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:00.401
- It's your turn, Daniel.
- Okay.

491
00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:02.742
Is this key the Master Key?

492
00:19:03.841 --> 00:19:05.371
Sung Kwang, move away
from him a bit more.

493
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:06.671
Move back.

494
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:08.942
- Hold on a minute.
- That's vague facial expression.

495
00:19:09.141 --> 00:19:10.681
He's not showing any expressions.

496
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:13.212
(He almost loses his poker face.)

497
00:19:13.212 --> 00:19:14.212
- He smiled just slightly.
- That was...

498
00:19:14.212 --> 00:19:15.821
I think his smile was fake.

499
00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:17.222
- Seong Wu, what do you think?
- Yes?

500
00:19:17.651 --> 00:19:19.591
The Daniel I know...

501
00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:22.192
(How will Seong Wu
evaluate Daniel's expression?)

502
00:19:22.192 --> 00:19:23.692
The Daniel I know...

503
00:19:24.462 --> 00:19:26.762
is raising some doubts.

504
00:19:26.762 --> 00:19:29.562
Daniel seems suspicious? Then,
Seong Wu, you're suspicious too.

505
00:19:29.962 --> 00:19:31.972
You tried to put the spotlight
on someone else.

506
00:19:32.431 --> 00:19:34.871
Is this key the Master Key?

507
00:19:34.871 --> 00:19:36.202
(Jin Young and Han Na
will check their keys next.)

508
00:19:36.202 --> 00:19:38.671
Is this key the Master Key?

509
00:19:38.671 --> 00:19:39.671
I think he's acting.

510
00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:43.681
- He's trying to act now.
- I don't think he has it.

511
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:45.552
- I don't think his key is the Key.
- If he reads it too long, it's not.

512
00:19:45.552 --> 00:19:46.611
She just smiled.

513
00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:48.181
- Why is she smiling?
- She's acting now?

514
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:49.821
- Goodness.
- Why is it funny?

515
00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.552
- She has a strange expression on.
- He's looking at it too long.

516
00:19:51.552 --> 00:19:53.591
- It means it's not it.
- He smiled.

517
00:19:54.792 --> 00:19:56.992
Is this key the Master Key?

518
00:19:57.292 --> 00:19:59.091
- I don't know about his.
- You saw it?

519
00:19:59.091 --> 00:20:00.161
Eun Woo.

520
00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:02.002
Look at his face.

521
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:04.931
- He's confident.
- It hasn't changed even a bit.

522
00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:07.272
- No, no.
- Bo Ah. It's your turn.

523
00:20:07.302 --> 00:20:09.472
Bo Ah has big eyes.

524
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.472
She's a good actress,
but she has big eyes.

525
00:20:11.472 --> 00:20:13.312
Her eyes are really pretty.

526
00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:14.641
- That was so sudden.
- Excuse me.

527
00:20:15.542 --> 00:20:16.982
- You can't share your feelings.
- He's cute.

528
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:18.752
I just said her eyes are pretty.

529
00:20:18.752 --> 00:20:21.351
Are you hitting on Bo Ah
since it didn't work on Han Na?

530
00:20:21.821 --> 00:20:23.782
Is your ideal type Bo Ah?

531
00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:28.661
- Ask the question.
- Her face got red.

532
00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:30.591
Is this key the Master Key?

533
00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:34.232
Look at her eyes.

534
00:20:34.661 --> 00:20:37.131
- They got big and small.
- I don't see any changes.

535
00:20:37.331 --> 00:20:40.371
- She's so good at acting.
- Actually, it may be more likely...

536
00:20:40.601 --> 00:20:41.972
people with poker faces
have the Key.

537
00:20:42.671 --> 00:20:45.671
Is this key the Master Key?

538
00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:48.111
He said it without getting it wrong.

539
00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:51.411
Then you can't read either, can you?

540
00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:53.482
I can't see.

541
00:20:56.651 --> 00:21:00.621
(We got you!)

542
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:02.562
What?

543
00:21:03.222 --> 00:21:05.391
- That was so terrible.
- That's horrible acting.

544
00:21:05.391 --> 00:21:06.462
Don't even try.

545
00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:08.931
You should resign from this show.

546
00:21:09.032 --> 00:21:10.802
- Why?
- That was amazing.

547
00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:12.171
This is the first episode.

548
00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:15.202
- How can you act right away?
- He's unbelievable.

549
00:21:15.272 --> 00:21:19.012
Jong Min has the reputation.
So I can't figure him out.

550
00:21:19.472 --> 00:21:20.841
Everyone, you must form
your own judgment.

551
00:21:20.871 --> 00:21:22.641
- I don't think he has it.
- All right. Please start.

552
00:21:25.782 --> 00:21:27.911
Can you stop doing old gestures?

553
00:21:27.952 --> 00:21:29.921
- Seriously.
- Are you a magician?

554
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:31.421
A magician for the kids show.

555
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:36.022
(He's chanting a ridiculous spell.)

556
00:21:37.091 --> 00:21:39.361
Queen Ankhesenamen.

557
00:21:39.562 --> 00:21:41.802
- What? Ankhesenamen?
- What was that?

558
00:21:41.802 --> 00:21:43.762
- He must've seen the film recently.
- Ankhesenamen.

559
00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:44.831
(He's saying nonsense.)

560
00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:47.802
Is this key the Master Key?

561
00:21:47.802 --> 00:21:48.972
No, your height is 160cm.

562
00:21:50.371 --> 00:21:52.071
Ankhesenamen.

563
00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:54.942
Ankhesenamen.

564
00:22:00.081 --> 00:22:02.321
(I have received your message.)

565
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:03.881
- Why is he smiling?
- I don't know.

566
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:06.321
- No way. He doesn't have it.
- His key isn't the Master Key.

567
00:22:06.921 --> 00:22:09.361
- He talks too much. It's not it.
- No.

568
00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:11.692
- He doesn't have it.
- I know him. His key isn't it.

569
00:22:11.692 --> 00:22:13.192
In fact, Jong Min might
have the Key.

570
00:22:13.292 --> 00:22:15.661
- No way.
- It's so hard to read the faces.

571
00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:21.131
All right. Now, every player
has finished checking the keys.

572
00:22:21.571 --> 00:22:24.472
The game to figure out...

573
00:22:24.472 --> 00:22:28.111
the owners of the Master Keys
will begin right away.

574
00:22:28.171 --> 00:22:30.581
(Among 12 players,
only 2 hold the Master Keys.)

575
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:32.581
(Which 2 players are
holding the Keys?)

576
00:22:32.881 --> 00:22:36.282
(Room of Fate and the locker-room)

577
00:22:37.621 --> 00:22:39.421
- What is it?
- It was obvious.

578
00:22:39.452 --> 00:22:41.252
- It was very obvious.
- I figured out at least one player.

579
00:22:41.252 --> 00:22:43.391
- No.
- I'm on the red team.

580
00:22:43.762 --> 00:22:44.992
I'm on the read team.

581
00:22:45.631 --> 00:22:46.962
Do we have to change?

582
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:50.661
I'll keep your secret.

583
00:22:51.232 --> 00:22:52.331
- You have it, don't you?
- Henry.

584
00:22:52.331 --> 00:22:54.772
- There's food too.
- No, I don't.

585
00:22:54.772 --> 00:22:56.502
- Henry is feeling him out.
- Henry.

586
00:22:56.702 --> 00:22:58.071
I know you have it, Henry.

587
00:22:58.242 --> 00:22:59.542
Stop acting like you don't have it.

588
00:22:59.542 --> 00:23:01.242
One of the players looked
so obvious just now.

589
00:23:01.611 --> 00:23:02.982
(One of the players looked
so obvious just now.)

590
00:23:03.141 --> 00:23:05.312
- That player made it look obvious.
- Which one?

591
00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:07.411
There's one. I won't share it.

592
00:23:08.421 --> 00:23:10.381
- Right, Daniel?
- Wait, no.

593
00:23:10.381 --> 00:23:11.851
(1st prime suspect, Daniel)

594
00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:13.821
- "Wait, no." You sounded awkward.
- Didn't I catch you off guard?

595
00:23:14.121 --> 00:23:15.421
Come on. Stop it.

596
00:23:15.421 --> 00:23:16.591
I think Daniel does have it.

597
00:23:16.591 --> 00:23:17.762
- You think so, don't you?
- No, I don't.

598
00:23:18.022 --> 00:23:20.692
- I saw your facial expression.
- I'm certain you don't have it.

599
00:23:21.391 --> 00:23:23.202
(Baek Hyun's facial expression
seemed suspicious?)

600
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:26.871
(He was checking
the fate of his key.)

601
00:23:26.871 --> 00:23:28.032
Wait. There's nothing...

602
00:23:28.972 --> 00:23:30.472
(You pretended you couldn't see it.
How suspicious!)

603
00:23:30.972 --> 00:23:33.341
- Why couldn't you see anything?
- Let's put a pin on Baek Hyun.

604
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:36.282
- Baek Hyun seems suspicious to me.
- You...

605
00:23:36.742 --> 00:23:39.482
- We have to take off pants here.
- Can we change here?

606
00:23:39.552 --> 00:23:41.851
- That's okay.
- Can the viewers see my body?

607
00:23:42.052 --> 00:23:43.121
Seriously?

608
00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:45.391
Goodness, how can
your body be so muscular?

609
00:23:46.151 --> 00:23:49.421
(Hidden muscles under his pretty
face charm the female viewers.)

610
00:23:50.222 --> 00:23:51.462
(I have the best muscular body!)

611
00:23:51.462 --> 00:23:53.032
Daniel, that's so cool.

612
00:23:53.131 --> 00:23:54.861
Everyone in the dormitory...

613
00:23:55.562 --> 00:23:57.931
(We comply
with the broadcasting regulations.)

614
00:23:58.202 --> 00:23:59.772
But doesn't it feel
like we're in a sauna?

615
00:24:01.002 --> 00:24:03.242
Even when we are talking,
someone has the Keys.

616
00:24:03.242 --> 00:24:05.871
- Right. They must be having fun.
- I'm so envious of you.

617
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:06.972
I'm serious.

618
00:24:07.042 --> 00:24:08.242
It's bright now.

619
00:24:08.242 --> 00:24:10.442
I feel like I got out of a theater
after watching a film.

620
00:24:10.442 --> 00:24:11.641
Goodness, this is incredible.

621
00:24:11.641 --> 00:24:13.381
- Oh, my.
- What is this?

622
00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:16.782
- Goodness, this is quite big.
- Look at that.

623
00:24:17.621 --> 00:24:19.621
- This is amazing.
- What an honor.

624
00:24:19.621 --> 00:24:22.292
I think players on Team Red
have already been...

625
00:24:22.292 --> 00:24:24.391
divided into their own.

626
00:24:24.391 --> 00:24:27.331
Baek Hyun and Daniel
are good at sports.

627
00:24:27.331 --> 00:24:29.232
And she holds
the fourth-degree black belt.

628
00:24:29.232 --> 00:24:31.262
Jong Min and Hyun Moo
are useless in sports.

629
00:24:31.262 --> 00:24:32.472
Come on.

630
00:24:32.472 --> 00:24:35.141
- Henry can't do much either.
- We have a good player though.

631
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:37.202
All right. We'll stop here.

632
00:24:37.202 --> 00:24:39.242
(During the power struggle,
the monitors are turned on.)

633
00:24:39.242 --> 00:24:40.571
- "Each team must..."
- "Each team must..."

634
00:24:40.571 --> 00:24:42.411
- "place the keys in the storage."
- "place the keys in the storage."

635
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:43.982
Goodness, Master Key!

636
00:24:44.681 --> 00:24:46.952
- They prepared a lot.
- Indeed.

637
00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:48.921
I think mine is a Master Key.

638
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:53.452
(12 players are divided into
Team Su Geun and Team Hyun Moo.)

639
00:24:53.621 --> 00:25:01.492
(The winning team will get the hint
to figure out who have Master Keys.)

640
00:25:01.901 --> 00:25:04.901
The viewers can
actually participate...

641
00:25:04.901 --> 00:25:06.931
- in our show.
- This is really important.

642
00:25:06.931 --> 00:25:09.302
Before the shoot, on our website,

643
00:25:09.302 --> 00:25:13.171
the crew revealed the players of the
show for viewers called Watchers.

644
00:25:13.171 --> 00:25:15.482
I complained to the crew why
we're doing something like this.

645
00:25:15.482 --> 00:25:16.942
- We were on that list.
- That's right.

646
00:25:16.942 --> 00:25:18.851
- Do you think they'd vote for us?
- Sure.

647
00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:19.952
Did we get any votes?

648
00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:21.052
- I don't know.
- The voting...

649
00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:23.151
- will ruin some people.
- Right.

650
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:26.192
Sung Kwang, Su Geun, Jong Min,
and I won't expect anything.

651
00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:29.391
This isn't fair. Only viewers
above 40 should vote.

652
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:32.631
The player the Watchers are
rooting for the most.

653
00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:34.631
We have the result, don't we?

654
00:25:34.631 --> 00:25:36.161
- Are we going to reveal the player?
- What if it's me?

655
00:25:36.161 --> 00:25:37.861
I hope the player is
from our team though.

656
00:25:37.861 --> 00:25:40.202
I can see that some of you are
actually looking forward to it.

657
00:25:40.202 --> 00:25:42.571
- I can spot a few of you.
- No, I'm not.

658
00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:44.871
- Please reveal it.
- Since we don't know the result,

659
00:25:44.871 --> 00:25:46.942
- we should look nervous.
- No one can get upset...

660
00:25:46.942 --> 00:25:48.171
because they got only a few votes.

661
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:51.341
Who is the player the Watchers
are rooting for the most?

662
00:25:51.881 --> 00:25:53.012
Please reveal it!

663
00:25:53.012 --> 00:25:54.581
(The player with the most support
from the Watchers)

664
00:25:55.081 --> 00:25:57.081
(Will it be Daniel who is
well-known these days?)

665
00:25:57.651 --> 00:25:59.692
(Or will it be Baek Hyun
who is a complete package?)

666
00:26:00.452 --> 00:26:01.591
(He's expectant too.)

667
00:26:01.591 --> 00:26:03.192
- Please.
- You'll reveal the whole ranking?

668
00:26:03.192 --> 00:26:04.262
Please be me.

669
00:26:05.492 --> 00:26:08.431
(The contest of the preliminary
voting will be neck and neck.)

670
00:26:08.431 --> 00:26:10.131
(Who will have the honor
of getting ranked 1st?)

671
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:11.431
- What if it's me?
- Show us the entire ranking.

672
00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:12.571
What if it's me?

673
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:14.401
(Baek Hyun)

674
00:26:15.502 --> 00:26:17.071
(Baek Hyun of Exo is ranked 1st.)

675
00:26:17.942 --> 00:26:19.442
(This is the class
of an idol singer.)

676
00:26:19.442 --> 00:26:21.071
- An Exo member was in that team.
- Thank you.

677
00:26:21.312 --> 00:26:23.012
- I knew it.
- I saw it coming.

678
00:26:23.012 --> 00:26:25.081
- You put your arm around him.
- Team Red won.

679
00:26:25.081 --> 00:26:26.151
You can take that.

680
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:27.252
Already?

681
00:26:27.381 --> 00:26:28.581
- Check the front.
- Really?

682
00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:30.181
- I thought it started next week.
- There are more than one.

683
00:26:30.181 --> 00:26:31.792
Why are there two envelopes?

684
00:26:31.792 --> 00:26:33.792
- Please take one.
- He can take whichever he wants.

685
00:26:34.321 --> 00:26:36.321
- This is amazing.
- This is such a good advantage.

686
00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:37.462
- He won it?
- Yes.

687
00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:40.032
- Then...
- I don't think it's Jong Min.

688
00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:41.062
Then who do you think it is?

689
00:26:41.062 --> 00:26:42.232
Hyun Moo.

690
00:26:42.532 --> 00:26:43.762
I think it'll be him too.

691
00:26:43.762 --> 00:26:44.861
- No.
- What about the last?

692
00:26:44.861 --> 00:26:47.032
He won't reveal what's
written on the card?

693
00:26:47.371 --> 00:26:48.502
Only he can know?

694
00:26:48.502 --> 00:26:50.841
- That sounds right.
- I bet Sung Kwang and Hyun Moo...

695
00:26:50.841 --> 00:26:54.171
(He can use the Gold Chance
Card at a critical moment.)

696
00:26:54.171 --> 00:26:55.442
I've decided.

697
00:26:56.442 --> 00:26:58.181
Thank you.
This is such a great card.

698
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:01.512
- I can turn the table around.
- Is it good for the team or you?

699
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:04.121
(The die has been cast.)

700
00:27:04.181 --> 00:27:07.921
(Baek Hyun's Gold Chance Card
brought a twist after a twist.)

701
00:27:08.621 --> 00:27:13.091
(What is his decision that
threw the game into chaos?)

702
00:27:13.232 --> 00:27:16.601
Let us know who got the least votes
to put him out of misery.

703
00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:17.962
- We know who got the most.
- You might get hurt.

704
00:27:17.962 --> 00:27:20.571
Didn't you purposely make whoever
got the least wear this shirt?

705
00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:23.442
- I guess this was a penalty.
- This...

706
00:27:23.442 --> 00:27:26.111
This is almost like a penalty.
He's wearing his mom's clothes.

707
00:27:26.571 --> 00:27:28.141
- Daniel, who do you think it is?
- Who is it?

708
00:27:28.482 --> 00:27:30.081
- They won't be offended.
- To be honest,

709
00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:31.482
- Who got the least votes?
- Well...

710
00:27:31.782 --> 00:27:33.681
Hyun Moo.

711
00:27:33.681 --> 00:27:35.421
That's right.
It's probably Hyun Moo.

712
00:27:35.782 --> 00:27:37.782
- I even hosted your debut show.
- Sorry.

713
00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:39.351
- Baek Hyun, what about you?
- I think it'd be Sung Kwang.

714
00:27:39.351 --> 00:27:40.851
- Sung Kwang?
- Really?

715
00:27:40.851 --> 00:27:42.091
We don't need to vote.
What about you, Jin Young?

716
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:43.722
Sung Kwang got two votes.

717
00:27:44.062 --> 00:27:45.661
- I agree.
- Three votes.

718
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:47.931
- She spoke to me for the 1st time.
- 4 votes.

719
00:27:47.931 --> 00:27:49.002
He's getting all the votes.

720
00:27:49.002 --> 00:27:50.002
Eun Woo?

721
00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:51.502
- I'm with them.
- Five votes.

722
00:27:51.502 --> 00:27:53.002
- Seong Wu?
- He might vote differently.

723
00:27:53.002 --> 00:27:54.802
- I think it'd Sung Kwang.
- Goodness.

724
00:27:54.802 --> 00:27:56.542
(Regretfully, he chooses
Sung Kwang as well.)

725
00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:58.272
If this is the case,
we shouldn't reveal the player.

726
00:27:58.272 --> 00:27:59.742
Hey, you're ranked first
at least in here.

727
00:27:59.742 --> 00:28:01.171
Somehow, I am ranked first here.

728
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:02.812
You should ask the question.

729
00:28:02.812 --> 00:28:05.381
"Who got the least votes?"

730
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:08.552
Who is it?

731
00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:10.621
(Jun Hyun Moo)

732
00:28:10.952 --> 00:28:14.022
(Jun Hyun Moo was ranked 12th
in the preliminary voting.)

733
00:28:14.022 --> 00:28:16.321
(We shouldn't have
checked the result.)

734
00:28:16.462 --> 00:28:17.462
I got it right!

735
00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:18.692
It's you!

736
00:28:19.931 --> 00:28:22.232
You lost out to me!
I got more votes!

737
00:28:22.232 --> 00:28:23.702
Hey, I have more votes than you.

738
00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:25.331
You should be ashamed of yourself!

739
00:28:25.331 --> 00:28:26.601
Let's be friends.

740
00:28:26.601 --> 00:28:28.802
- His ears got red. He's mad.
- Hold on.

741
00:28:28.802 --> 00:28:30.042
How many shows do I need to star on?

742
00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:31.942
- Are you all right?
- He's angry.

743
00:28:31.942 --> 00:28:33.141
- Come on.
- Wait.

744
00:28:33.141 --> 00:28:34.272
I'm not shocked that
I was ranked last.

745
00:28:34.272 --> 00:28:36.042
I'm shocked that I got
less votes than Sung Kwang.

746
00:28:36.042 --> 00:28:37.442
You should work on your reputation.

747
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:39.381
I got more votes,
but I'm not that happy either.

748
00:28:39.381 --> 00:28:40.482
What's the difference?

749
00:28:40.482 --> 00:28:42.621
- He got twice as many votes as you.
- Really?

750
00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:46.292
I must've gotten 2,
and you must've gotten 4.

751
00:28:46.292 --> 00:28:47.952
(There isn't much difference.)

752
00:28:47.952 --> 00:28:51.062
(The preliminary voting only
wounded the players.)

753
00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:53.091
- Okay.
- I should work harder.

754
00:28:53.091 --> 00:28:56.331
Let's play the first game.

755
00:28:56.831 --> 00:29:00.802
- What do we need to do?
- It's called Time Your Dance.

756
00:29:00.802 --> 00:29:03.371
Six players of each team will
dance in order.

757
00:29:03.371 --> 00:29:05.841
The last player must press the
buzzer as soon as the time is up.

758
00:29:05.841 --> 00:29:07.212
Then the team will win.

759
00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:10.782
But if they fail to do so, the last
player will face the penalty.

760
00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:11.851
- Can I do Thomas Flare?
- Yes.

761
00:29:11.851 --> 00:29:12.881
- Can I do Thomas Flare?
- Yes.

762
00:29:12.881 --> 00:29:14.651
- What is it?
- Give me a helmet.

763
00:29:14.651 --> 00:29:15.782
You're really good at it too.

764
00:29:15.782 --> 00:29:16.782
I'll do the wave.

765
00:29:16.782 --> 00:29:19.621
- Get ready to faint. It's too sexy.
- I'm so bad at dancing.

766
00:29:19.621 --> 00:29:21.762
And you musicians. You know
the choreography of your dance.

767
00:29:21.762 --> 00:29:23.692
And you musicians. You know
the choreography of your dance.

768
00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:25.462
- How will you know when time's up?
- We'll know.

769
00:29:25.462 --> 00:29:26.562
- How will you know when time's up?
- We'll know.

770
00:29:26.562 --> 00:29:28.931
- I actually practiced timing it.
- Henry, you must do well.

771
00:29:29.802 --> 00:29:31.772
We have to calculate by measures.

772
00:29:31.772 --> 00:29:34.272
- Baek Hyun, you should go.
- It's important.

773
00:29:34.302 --> 00:29:35.702
The last person must wear this.

774
00:29:35.702 --> 00:29:37.042
Your outfit is so red.

775
00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:38.671
This has shoulder pads.

776
00:29:39.812 --> 00:29:40.942
Let's go.

777
00:29:40.942 --> 00:29:42.681
Don't forget. It's 100 seconds.

778
00:29:42.681 --> 00:29:44.381
- Play the music.
- Play it.

779
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:46.982
Let's go. Here we go!

780
00:29:47.851 --> 00:29:50.121
(They must know
when their 100 seconds are up.)

781
00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:52.151
Sung Kwang, you must
dance more passionately.

782
00:29:52.222 --> 00:29:54.192
(He gets excited and
brightens up the atmosphere.)

783
00:29:55.052 --> 00:29:57.062
(They start distracting the team
at the same time.)

784
00:29:57.891 --> 00:29:59.391
(Let's stay calm.)

785
00:30:00.161 --> 00:30:03.361
(Other players must count
the numbers and dance to succeed.)

786
00:30:07.371 --> 00:30:09.442
(The music changes
to the second song.)

787
00:30:11.442 --> 00:30:14.772
(He executes the move well.)

788
00:30:15.212 --> 00:30:16.681
This is Kang Daniel!

789
00:30:18.712 --> 00:30:20.111
He's a good dancer.

790
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:22.821
What are you looking at? Just dance.

791
00:30:23.482 --> 00:30:25.522
- Hyun. You should just dance.
- Should I pass it on now?

792
00:30:25.522 --> 00:30:27.452
(Hyun focuses on counting
even if he wants to dance.)

793
00:30:28.921 --> 00:30:32.631
(He brings more excitement
to the set with the song.)

794
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:34.762
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

795
00:30:34.762 --> 00:30:35.962
(The third song plays.)

796
00:30:35.962 --> 00:30:38.601
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

797
00:30:38.601 --> 00:30:39.802
(They distract him more
as time passes.)

798
00:30:39.802 --> 00:30:41.272
That's such an old move.

799
00:30:42.272 --> 00:30:44.772
Look at Su Geun.
Baek Hyun, he's good.

800
00:30:44.772 --> 00:30:46.911
(This is a dance move
from the 1990s.)

801
00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:48.272
Baek Hyun.

802
00:30:48.272 --> 00:30:52.851
(Now, the singer of the song gets
to dance to the song.)

803
00:30:53.282 --> 00:30:54.611
Goodness.

804
00:30:55.452 --> 00:30:57.552
Did about 50 seconds pass?

805
00:30:57.552 --> 00:30:59.621
(This is how you should
dance to this song.)

806
00:31:00.651 --> 00:31:01.921
- 50 seconds?
- 50 seconds.

807
00:31:01.921 --> 00:31:03.992
It's been 50 seconds.

808
00:31:05.732 --> 00:31:07.431
What's going on?

809
00:31:09.361 --> 00:31:12.772
(This is the sexy wave dance?)

810
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:14.472
What is this?

811
00:31:14.472 --> 00:31:15.702
Baek Hyun, look at her.

812
00:31:15.702 --> 00:31:16.972
(She's showing the dance
she promised.)

813
00:31:16.972 --> 00:31:18.611
Baek Hyun, what happened?

814
00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:20.272
- That's nice.
- That's cute.

815
00:31:20.272 --> 00:31:21.272
That was cute.

816
00:31:21.272 --> 00:31:22.411
(The game depends on his hand now.)

817
00:31:22.411 --> 00:31:23.881
Baek Hyun, did you count?

818
00:31:24.542 --> 00:31:27.482
He's good. He's a good dancer.

819
00:31:28.212 --> 00:31:30.022
- What's the time?
- How long is he going to dance?

820
00:31:30.022 --> 00:31:31.452
45 seconds.

821
00:31:31.452 --> 00:31:32.621
(He looks composed so far.)

822
00:31:32.621 --> 00:31:34.492
It's been 54 seconds.

823
00:31:36.062 --> 00:31:38.962
(Without knowing how long
it's been, the song changes.)

824
00:31:38.962 --> 00:31:40.462
Isn't the time up?

825
00:31:40.462 --> 00:31:41.692
62 seconds.

826
00:31:42.032 --> 00:31:43.032
88 seconds.

827
00:31:43.032 --> 00:31:45.871
- 64 seconds.
- Baek Hyun, you can do it!

828
00:31:46.302 --> 00:31:47.331
What is it?

829
00:31:48.202 --> 00:31:49.901
Gosh, what's that?

830
00:31:50.401 --> 00:31:52.212
(The time is up, and
Baek Hyun fails.)

831
00:31:52.371 --> 00:31:53.371
No way.

832
00:31:55.111 --> 00:31:58.411
(The penalty for those who failed
is the cold water shower.)

833
00:31:59.782 --> 00:32:01.452
(It's fun since it's someone else
getting the penalty.)

834
00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:04.181
(Is this really happening?)

835
00:32:04.181 --> 00:32:06.421
(He stopped at 104 seconds,
so it counts as a failure.)

836
00:32:06.421 --> 00:32:11.062
(If you're wrong, you'll have
to face the cold water.)

837
00:32:12.861 --> 00:32:14.492
(He wants to cry.)

838
00:32:15.202 --> 00:32:16.401
What is this?

839
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:19.002
(An unexpected penalty makes
them burst into laughter.)

840
00:32:19.002 --> 00:32:20.532
- No way.
- Bring it to me.

841
00:32:20.532 --> 00:32:23.141
Hey, I'm not going to play this.
I won't time it.

842
00:32:23.601 --> 00:32:25.212
- You were so right.
- I didn't expect this at all.

843
00:32:25.212 --> 00:32:27.841
- You look sexy.
- My hair is better than yours now.

844
00:32:28.171 --> 00:32:29.841
Do I have a chance
to blow-dry my hair?

845
00:32:30.512 --> 00:32:31.952
- Do I have the chance?
- Hey, Baek Hyun.

846
00:32:31.952 --> 00:32:34.911
- Every song has a different tempo.
- I got it.

847
00:32:34.911 --> 00:32:36.881
Okay. I think Bo Ah is...

848
00:32:36.881 --> 00:32:39.692
the best at doing
the wave dance in Korea.

849
00:32:39.692 --> 00:32:40.921
That was so surprising.

850
00:32:40.921 --> 00:32:43.692
She started from here, but ended
up all the way in the back.

851
00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:46.131
(This is the sexy wave
dance she prepared.)

852
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:47.292
I didn't know she'd dance like that.

853
00:32:47.292 --> 00:32:49.601
- I learned it last week.
- I didn't know. Really?

854
00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:51.032
- That's no joke.
- The water...

855
00:32:51.032 --> 00:32:52.032
(She needs the computer graphics.)

856
00:32:52.032 --> 00:32:53.401
I thought you were getting
a physical therapy.

857
00:32:53.401 --> 00:32:55.901
I bet Han Na would feel a bit
intimidated by her dance.

858
00:32:55.901 --> 00:32:57.571
- It's our turn.
- Who will be the last player?

859
00:32:57.571 --> 00:32:58.841
- We should discuss it.
- I practiced timing the dance.

860
00:32:58.841 --> 00:33:00.671
We should discuss it. We need
to come up with a good plan.

861
00:33:00.671 --> 00:33:03.212
- Wouldn't Henry be good at it?
- Henry, are you good at this?

862
00:33:03.212 --> 00:33:05.581
- Henry is a genius musician.
- That's right.

863
00:33:05.581 --> 00:33:07.151
- He plays the piano.
- You should go last.

864
00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:09.022
- He is a musical genius.
- Think that you're a metronome.

865
00:33:10.022 --> 00:33:13.292
- Hold on. Let's talk this over.
- Henry. Henry.

866
00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:15.492
- What should I do?
- Your hair got so flat.

867
00:33:15.492 --> 00:33:16.621
- Wait.
- No.

868
00:33:16.621 --> 00:33:18.292
- That's not right.
- We haven't decided it.

869
00:33:18.292 --> 00:33:19.962
- No, we made our decision.
- Who?

870
00:33:19.962 --> 00:33:21.331
- I can't.
- You're a talented musician.

871
00:33:21.331 --> 00:33:22.702
- No, no.
- Henry is a genius.

872
00:33:22.702 --> 00:33:23.901
I know nothing about music.

873
00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:25.972
You're good at timing the beats.

874
00:33:25.972 --> 00:33:27.831
Let's see. Who will be
the last player from your team?

875
00:33:28.071 --> 00:33:30.671
He's the walking metronome
the whole world acknowledges.

876
00:33:30.671 --> 00:33:32.512
- He's a musical genius.
- He's a genius indeed.

877
00:33:32.512 --> 00:33:34.611
- I have faith in him.
- Get ready. You'll start now.

878
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:36.742
- We can do it.
- Play the music!

879
00:33:36.742 --> 00:33:38.611
(The 2nd round starts!)

880
00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:42.921
(She's getting into the song.)

881
00:33:45.752 --> 00:33:46.821
(This is the dance I'll do!)

882
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:49.492
How adorable! That's cute.

883
00:33:49.621 --> 00:33:53.232
(Gosh, this is making
me so excited!)

884
00:33:53.232 --> 00:33:54.831
That's great!

885
00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:56.962
(Here comes Hyun Moo's hyper dance.)

886
00:33:58.202 --> 00:33:59.571
What is that? Come on.

887
00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:00.631
(He's silly from head to toe.)

888
00:34:02.141 --> 00:34:04.171
(This walking metronome
is fully occupied.)

889
00:34:06.571 --> 00:34:09.742
(He's after the ladies
as well as 100 seconds.)

890
00:34:09.742 --> 00:34:11.012
(All I hear is the clock
ticking away.)

891
00:34:11.982 --> 00:34:13.551
(His strong moves come
from his long legs and arms.)

892
00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:14.551
He's good.

893
00:34:14.812 --> 00:34:15.982
He's charming.

894
00:34:16.652 --> 00:34:18.322
You can do it slowly.

895
00:34:18.822 --> 00:34:20.121
Slowly.

896
00:34:20.522 --> 00:34:22.692
(He's so concentrated in counting
the time.)

897
00:34:22.692 --> 00:34:23.792
45 seconds.

898
00:34:25.022 --> 00:34:26.062
Do it now.

899
00:34:26.062 --> 00:34:27.132
(Do it now.)

900
00:34:28.931 --> 00:34:31.971
(Here is the dancing machine
from the 20th century.)

901
00:34:33.072 --> 00:34:35.301
(His moves are same.)

902
00:34:35.301 --> 00:34:36.971
Henry! Henry!

903
00:34:36.971 --> 00:34:38.641
- Henry.
- Go!

904
00:34:39.011 --> 00:34:40.842
- Good.
- Good.

905
00:34:40.842 --> 00:34:42.882
(It's Seong Wu's turn.)

906
00:34:42.882 --> 00:34:46.252
(It's Wanna One's key dance,
thigh dance.)

907
00:34:46.982 --> 00:34:48.011
"Red Flavor".

908
00:34:48.011 --> 00:34:49.882
(I can handle "Red Flavor".)

909
00:34:49.882 --> 00:34:51.621
I think Henry got confused.

910
00:34:52.491 --> 00:34:54.121
90 seconds!

911
00:34:54.121 --> 00:34:56.322
- He's wrong.
- He's confused now.

912
00:34:56.322 --> 00:34:58.431
(Henry is the last person to dance.)

913
00:34:58.661 --> 00:35:00.692
If he gets this one right,
he is a genius.

914
00:35:00.692 --> 00:35:02.701
- Why are you not dancing?
- I'm certain.

915
00:35:03.402 --> 00:35:05.431
- Why are you not dancing?
- 99 seconds.

916
00:35:05.801 --> 00:35:07.301
If he gets this one right,
he is a genius.

917
00:35:08.031 --> 00:35:09.371
(Pouring)

918
00:35:09.871 --> 00:35:12.172
(No way he is a human metronome.)

919
00:35:13.312 --> 00:35:16.942
(Don't be so sloppy, Henry.)

920
00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:19.281
They are cruel.

921
00:35:20.312 --> 00:35:22.922
I was so certain.
Why did you call my name then?

922
00:35:25.721 --> 00:35:26.922
45 seconds.

923
00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:30.962
(He was right until 45 seconds.)

924
00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:34.661
(However,
he started counting faster.)

925
00:35:34.661 --> 00:35:35.831
55 seconds.

926
00:35:36.132 --> 00:35:38.672
- Why are you not dancing?
- I'm certain.

927
00:35:38.831 --> 00:35:40.871
- Why are you not dancing?
- 99 seconds. 100 seconds.

928
00:35:42.701 --> 00:35:45.971
(His counting was 6 seconds ahead.)

929
00:35:47.042 --> 00:35:48.542
(He's sad.)

930
00:35:48.542 --> 00:35:49.681
No way.

931
00:35:49.781 --> 00:35:53.011
He was supposed to dance,
but he was only counting.

932
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:54.482
Don't you know this dance?

933
00:35:55.581 --> 00:35:58.422
Don't you know this dance?
It's so popular in Europe.

934
00:35:58.422 --> 00:36:00.822
If you make the dance funny,
we will just let it pass.

935
00:36:00.851 --> 00:36:02.322
No.

936
00:36:02.322 --> 00:36:03.422
(Just do your signature dance.)

937
00:36:03.422 --> 00:36:05.792
That's why you're not popular.

938
00:36:06.092 --> 00:36:08.031
I haven't seen this dance
for so long.

939
00:36:08.092 --> 00:36:10.862
- It's an old dance.
- We lost the dance competition.

940
00:36:10.862 --> 00:36:12.801
- It's an old dance.
- You won.

941
00:36:12.801 --> 00:36:14.431
- Let's move on.
- Okay.

942
00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:17.002
(He looks handsome even
when he's only moving his hands.)

943
00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:21.812
(You need more practice.)

944
00:36:23.542 --> 00:36:25.681
I need to just press the button
at 100 seconds, right?

945
00:36:25.752 --> 00:36:26.752
I think she will do well.

946
00:36:26.752 --> 00:36:28.551
How old is Bo Ah?

947
00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:31.581
(Wait for my dance.)

948
00:36:31.581 --> 00:36:34.692
You guys were asked each other
to go up there.

949
00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:36.092
And keep decline.

950
00:36:36.092 --> 00:36:38.831
Bo Ah just volunteers herself.

951
00:36:38.891 --> 00:36:40.132
Let me do it.

952
00:36:40.362 --> 00:36:42.261
Why is she so confident? Music...

953
00:36:43.362 --> 00:36:44.402
please.

954
00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:45.672
(3rd round begins.)

955
00:36:48.002 --> 00:36:50.141
(It starts off with Exo's "Growl".)

956
00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:53.272
They only play songs
that fits the singers too well.

957
00:36:53.272 --> 00:36:57.141
(She can't enjoy
this dance festival.)

958
00:36:58.581 --> 00:36:59.911
Dance together.

959
00:37:02.982 --> 00:37:04.081
Let's go.

960
00:37:04.351 --> 00:37:06.522
(Even if we get it wrong,
just dance.)

961
00:37:07.721 --> 00:37:08.922
(He's a bad dancer.)

962
00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:13.632
(It's your turn.)

963
00:37:14.661 --> 00:37:16.431
(The song changes to "Pick Me".)

964
00:37:16.431 --> 00:37:18.431
(Pick me, pick me, pick me up)

965
00:37:19.272 --> 00:37:20.471
I don't want to look at his dance.

966
00:37:20.772 --> 00:37:22.371
He looks like a baby octopus.

967
00:37:22.641 --> 00:37:24.201
He looks like a baby octopus.

968
00:37:24.601 --> 00:37:26.712
- Good.
- Let's go.

969
00:37:27.911 --> 00:37:29.281
- Good.
- He's trying it so hard.

970
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:30.982
(The baby octopus opens up
the "Pick Me" time.)

971
00:37:32.351 --> 00:37:36.482
(It's Daniel's dance time.)

972
00:37:37.252 --> 00:37:39.422
(What?)

973
00:37:39.422 --> 00:37:42.022
(Even if the song changes,
I know how to groove.)

974
00:37:42.022 --> 00:37:44.221
(He plays an imaginary guitar
nicely.)

975
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:45.491
He is good.

976
00:37:45.891 --> 00:37:47.192
He is a good dancer.

977
00:37:48.562 --> 00:37:49.801
Quick!

978
00:37:49.862 --> 00:37:51.261
Okay. Take the turns quickly.

979
00:37:51.431 --> 00:37:52.831
She said we have to be quick.

980
00:37:53.431 --> 00:37:54.772
(62 seconds passed.)

981
00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:57.141
- 100 seconds!
- He's also good.

982
00:37:57.902 --> 00:38:00.342
Do it quickly!

983
00:38:00.572 --> 00:38:02.712
Quick.

984
00:38:02.982 --> 00:38:04.442
Now.

985
00:38:04.442 --> 00:38:05.511
Gosh.

986
00:38:06.011 --> 00:38:07.851
(She stopped the time.)

987
00:38:08.922 --> 00:38:10.781
- She pressed it.
- I think she pressed it too early.

988
00:38:11.621 --> 00:38:12.792
(Pouring)

989
00:38:12.792 --> 00:38:14.422
(Bo Ah failed to get it right.)

990
00:38:14.422 --> 00:38:15.692
Oh no.

991
00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:19.261
- Are you okay?
- Gosh.

992
00:38:19.632 --> 00:38:23.402
(Here is a waterfall.)

993
00:38:24.132 --> 00:38:25.272
Oh my gosh.

994
00:38:25.272 --> 00:38:26.772
(She is wide awake.)

995
00:38:26.772 --> 00:38:28.471
Are you okay?

996
00:38:28.971 --> 00:38:30.172
Are you okay?

997
00:38:30.172 --> 00:38:32.172
How many seconds was it then?

998
00:38:32.241 --> 00:38:34.141
Hold on. I will write it down.

999
00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:36.181
You are not mad, are you?

1000
00:38:36.712 --> 00:38:38.112
She checks the time first.

1001
00:38:38.112 --> 00:38:39.382
She is professional.

1002
00:38:39.482 --> 00:38:40.681
Gosh.

1003
00:38:40.681 --> 00:38:43.581
(Team Su Geun counted until
79.61 seconds.)

1004
00:38:43.581 --> 00:38:45.391
You deserve it.

1005
00:38:46.322 --> 00:38:47.991
She's so weird.
Her dance was not even good,

1006
00:38:47.991 --> 00:38:49.462
and told me to finish
my dance quickly.

1007
00:38:49.592 --> 00:38:51.261
She sounded so certain.

1008
00:38:51.261 --> 00:38:52.991
(She hurried Su Geun
and she failed.)

1009
00:38:53.862 --> 00:38:56.632
Let's go forward
when it's your turn.

1010
00:38:56.632 --> 00:38:58.601
- Okay.
- No.

1011
00:38:58.601 --> 00:39:00.931
Eun Woo just needs to do it himself.

1012
00:39:01.101 --> 00:39:03.442
You just keep dancing like this.

1013
00:39:03.572 --> 00:39:05.212
Please count with me.

1014
00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:08.011
Are you ready? Music please.

1015
00:39:09.382 --> 00:39:10.411
("Genuine" by Koyote)

1016
00:39:10.411 --> 00:39:12.451
It starts now. Get ready.

1017
00:39:13.511 --> 00:39:15.581
(What is this song?)

1018
00:39:15.581 --> 00:39:17.422
No. This is a bad song.

1019
00:39:17.422 --> 00:39:19.991
- Why?
- Don't listen to this song.

1020
00:39:20.092 --> 00:39:22.022
Her dances are similar to mine.

1021
00:39:22.692 --> 00:39:26.132
- Yes.
- In 1, 2, 3, 4.

1022
00:39:26.132 --> 00:39:27.891
(They start to disturb
Hyun Moo's team.)

1023
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:30.931
(I can't hear anything.)

1024
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:33.531
(He's also counting.)

1025
00:39:34.431 --> 00:39:38.411
(Pass the windy reed field)

1026
00:39:39.042 --> 00:39:43.411
(He calmly continues to count.)

1027
00:39:44.241 --> 00:39:47.752
(Other members are partying.)

1028
00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:51.922
(We trust Seong Wu and Eun Woo.)

1029
00:39:54.822 --> 00:39:56.261
(As Su Geun starts singing
"Arirang",)

1030
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:57.491
(Henry covers Seong Wu's ears.)

1031
00:39:58.292 --> 00:40:02.402
(It's torture to keep
himself from dancing.)

1032
00:40:06.002 --> 00:40:07.371
(A satisfying moonwalk)

1033
00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:09.101
He's good.

1034
00:40:10.342 --> 00:40:14.971
(Seong Wu and Eun Woo
continue to count.)

1035
00:40:15.141 --> 00:40:17.141
- How long has it been?
- How long?

1036
00:40:17.411 --> 00:40:18.652
It's early.

1037
00:40:18.652 --> 00:40:21.652
- Keep going.
- It's been only 50 seconds.

1038
00:40:21.781 --> 00:40:23.322
- 7,
- 7,

1039
00:40:23.422 --> 00:40:27.092
- 6, 5, 4, 3...
- 6, 5, 4, 3...

1040
00:40:27.422 --> 00:40:29.462
- He's good.
- 2, 1.

1041
00:40:29.462 --> 00:40:31.362
(I can't hold my excitement.)

1042
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:36.632
(This metronome is malfunctioning.)

1043
00:40:37.632 --> 00:40:41.801
(Forget it. Let's just dance.)

1044
00:40:42.572 --> 00:40:44.101
(I have to concentrate.)

1045
00:40:44.772 --> 00:40:46.572
- 9, 8...
- 9, 8...

1046
00:40:46.572 --> 00:40:49.942
7, 6,

1047
00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.712
5, 4, 3...

1048
00:40:52.712 --> 00:40:54.652
(He stopped the time.)

1049
00:40:55.951 --> 00:40:57.721
(Pouring)

1050
00:40:57.721 --> 00:40:59.121
(Eun Woo failed.)

1051
00:40:59.121 --> 00:41:01.322
- He's wet.
- Look at him.

1052
00:41:01.322 --> 00:41:03.362
(Even if they failed,
they left many great moments.)

1053
00:41:03.362 --> 00:41:06.431
(Han Na looks very excited.)

1054
00:41:07.391 --> 00:41:10.431
(Seong Wu's great moves)

1055
00:41:11.502 --> 00:41:17.701
(3 seconds before the rain,
when will they get it right?)

1056
00:41:17.772 --> 00:41:19.612
- 48 seconds.
- Let's go.

1057
00:41:19.712 --> 00:41:21.312
- 100 seconds.
- 4, 5, 6...

1058
00:41:21.572 --> 00:41:24.511
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17...

1059
00:41:24.511 --> 00:41:27.551
(What's going on?
On this beautiful day)

1060
00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:30.681
(It's going to be boring without
the interruption.)

1061
00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:33.051
Let's go!

1062
00:41:33.292 --> 00:41:35.462
(Stop me if you can.)

1063
00:41:37.422 --> 00:41:39.292
(He dances nicely.)

1064
00:41:39.292 --> 00:41:40.661
You can tell me when to stop.

1065
00:41:41.092 --> 00:41:42.831
Do this.

1066
00:41:42.902 --> 00:41:45.772
- 50 seconds.
- Just guess it.

1067
00:41:45.772 --> 00:41:48.172
Just trust your senses.

1068
00:41:48.232 --> 00:41:51.042
Wait for the first verse to end.

1069
00:41:51.911 --> 00:41:53.112
10,

1070
00:41:53.172 --> 00:41:56.681
- 9, 8, 7, 6,
- 9, 8, 7, 6,

1071
00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:59.081
- 5, 4, 3, 2...
- 5, 4, 3, 2...

1072
00:41:59.081 --> 00:42:00.081
(He stopped the time.)

1073
00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:01.451
(Pouring)

1074
00:42:03.181 --> 00:42:04.752
It was so close.

1075
00:42:04.752 --> 00:42:06.121
(Daniel has failed.)

1076
00:42:06.121 --> 00:42:07.752
He is so polite.

1077
00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:09.391
He is.

1078
00:42:09.991 --> 00:42:11.391
I think I can get it right
this time.

1079
00:42:11.491 --> 00:42:13.462
- Are you going to do it?
- Okay.

1080
00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:16.062
- Seong Wu wants to try it.
- Hey.

1081
00:42:16.062 --> 00:42:18.031
I think I can get it
right this time.

1082
00:42:18.031 --> 00:42:20.002
You want to do it on your own?
You don't need our help?

1083
00:42:20.772 --> 00:42:22.402
- Okay. I will do it.
- Are you sure?

1084
00:42:22.471 --> 00:42:24.172
- Are you going to do it alone?
- Just pass me the turn.

1085
00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:26.672
- Okay.
- When do we give your turn?

1086
00:42:26.672 --> 00:42:27.911
- Straight after we start?
- He seems confident.

1087
00:42:27.911 --> 00:42:30.581
- Let's dance for one second.
- I don't mind.

1088
00:42:30.741 --> 00:42:32.911
- Okay.
- Why do you guys...

1089
00:42:32.911 --> 00:42:34.281
always take 10 minutes to start?

1090
00:42:34.612 --> 00:42:36.181
Please. I beg you.

1091
00:42:36.181 --> 00:42:37.322
It's to win the game.

1092
00:42:37.482 --> 00:42:39.692
- It's our wish.
- Please.

1093
00:42:39.792 --> 00:42:41.252
Let's go.

1094
00:42:41.252 --> 00:42:42.991
Music please.

1095
00:42:42.991 --> 00:42:44.721
(6th round begins.)

1096
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:47.931
(Seong Wu starts counting.)

1097
00:42:48.632 --> 00:42:52.572
(This song helped me get famous.)

1098
00:42:52.572 --> 00:42:54.371
(Hyun Moo starts dancing.)

1099
00:42:54.371 --> 00:42:55.902
Finish your dance now.

1100
00:42:55.902 --> 00:42:57.672
(His dance has to be funny.)

1101
00:42:57.672 --> 00:42:59.911
- No.
- Don't get greedy.

1102
00:43:00.842 --> 00:43:03.112
- Stop dancing.
- Let's go.

1103
00:43:03.112 --> 00:43:04.382
(He's busy counting.)

1104
00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:06.382
Seong Wu!

1105
00:43:06.812 --> 00:43:08.522
Seong Wu.

1106
00:43:08.781 --> 00:43:09.922
- Let's go.
- Seong Wu.

1107
00:43:09.922 --> 00:43:11.681
Gosh. Dance harder.

1108
00:43:11.681 --> 00:43:12.891
(I don't care what they're doing.)

1109
00:43:12.891 --> 00:43:13.891
Seong Wu!

1110
00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:15.991
(He stays like a calm metronome.)

1111
00:43:17.362 --> 00:43:22.632
(You dance.
I will continue counting.)

1112
00:43:24.701 --> 00:43:25.831
Show us your moves.

1113
00:43:25.831 --> 00:43:28.971
(It's already Henry's turn.)

1114
00:43:28.971 --> 00:43:30.442
Dance.

1115
00:43:30.801 --> 00:43:32.342
(He moves like a clock.)

1116
00:43:32.342 --> 00:43:33.572
Did you count?

1117
00:43:36.342 --> 00:43:37.712
He's good.

1118
00:43:38.812 --> 00:43:40.252
(He keeps counting the time
without making a mistake.)

1119
00:43:40.511 --> 00:43:42.022
You're counting it wrong.

1120
00:43:42.022 --> 00:43:45.792
- It's too slow.
- 9, 8, 7, 6,

1121
00:43:46.192 --> 00:43:49.362
5, 4, 3,

1122
00:43:49.462 --> 00:43:50.862
He's going to fail.

1123
00:43:50.862 --> 00:43:52.192
He's doomed.

1124
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:54.632
- Look at him.
- He stopped counting.

1125
00:43:55.031 --> 00:43:56.132
I forgot.

1126
00:43:57.562 --> 00:43:58.632
(Shocking)

1127
00:43:58.632 --> 00:43:59.701
I forgot.

1128
00:43:59.732 --> 00:44:01.672
He's not even dancing.

1129
00:44:01.902 --> 00:44:04.072
Just guess it then.

1130
00:44:04.072 --> 00:44:05.572
(I can do this.)

1131
00:44:05.572 --> 00:44:09.281
(I promised my members.)

1132
00:44:09.281 --> 00:44:16.382
(He said he can do it this time.)

1133
00:44:16.951 --> 00:44:18.692
(But when the moment comes)

1134
00:44:18.692 --> 00:44:19.752
I forgot.

1135
00:44:22.121 --> 00:44:25.891
(We must trust Seong Wu now.)

1136
00:44:25.891 --> 00:44:29.201
(Will he get it in 100 seconds?)

1137
00:44:31.331 --> 00:44:32.331
Come on.

1138
00:44:32.331 --> 00:44:33.601
(Will he succeed?)

1139
00:44:33.601 --> 00:44:34.902
(Or not.)

1140
00:44:36.741 --> 00:44:37.801
Did you forget?

1141
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:39.371
Yes. I rushed.

1142
00:44:39.371 --> 00:44:40.741
(He forgot.)

1143
00:44:41.741 --> 00:44:43.112
I could do it before.

1144
00:44:43.112 --> 00:44:44.842
(He should've never got excited.)

1145
00:44:44.942 --> 00:44:46.081
Let me make a suggestion.

1146
00:44:46.081 --> 00:44:48.011
Whoever wins this game,

1147
00:44:48.011 --> 00:44:51.022
pick the most annoying person
from the other team...

1148
00:44:51.022 --> 00:44:52.152
and pour the rest of water.

1149
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:53.422
Okay?

1150
00:44:53.721 --> 00:44:55.721
Even if we win,
we'll do that on you.

1151
00:44:55.721 --> 00:44:57.792
- Sure. I'm making a suggestion.
- The most annoying person.

1152
00:44:57.991 --> 00:45:00.562
- Okay?
- Okay. Music please.

1153
00:45:00.562 --> 00:45:01.592
(7th round starts.)

1154
00:45:02.462 --> 00:45:03.732
("Loner" by Outsider)

1155
00:45:03.732 --> 00:45:05.601
It's killing the mood.

1156
00:45:06.402 --> 00:45:07.931
- What is he doing?
- Copy him.

1157
00:45:07.931 --> 00:45:09.741
(Forget about 100 seconds guess
for a second)

1158
00:45:09.741 --> 00:45:13.471
(Move your body
along the calm rhythm)

1159
00:45:13.471 --> 00:45:14.911
What if they get it?

1160
00:45:15.911 --> 00:45:18.081
That's Korean dance.
The movement of a swan.

1161
00:45:18.081 --> 00:45:19.152
(Baek Hyun the master
of Korean dance)

1162
00:45:19.152 --> 00:45:20.382
Oh, dear.

1163
00:45:21.882 --> 00:45:23.951
- That's good.
- 20 seconds.

1164
00:45:23.951 --> 00:45:26.152
How am I going to dance to it?

1165
00:45:26.351 --> 00:45:28.592
There's no answer to this.

1166
00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:29.761
(Everyone's out of idea.)

1167
00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:30.792
- Baek Hyun.
- Yes?

1168
00:45:30.792 --> 00:45:32.761
We're going to copy your dance.

1169
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:33.931
You need to do well.

1170
00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:36.701
(The first dance is important.)

1171
00:45:38.572 --> 00:45:39.601
Come on. Come on.

1172
00:45:39.601 --> 00:45:40.672
(Mr. Tong again?)

1173
00:45:40.672 --> 00:45:42.601
- It's Mr. Tong.
- Out of nowhere.

1174
00:45:42.601 --> 00:45:43.842
We can do it.

1175
00:45:43.842 --> 00:45:45.942
- Let's go with Mr. Tong.
- You need to teach me.

1176
00:45:45.942 --> 00:45:46.942
Mr. Tong dance.

1177
00:45:47.241 --> 00:45:50.081
(Tong dance with everyone)

1178
00:45:50.241 --> 00:45:53.712
(It's out of blue,
but it goes well.)

1179
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:57.051
(He's counting seconds
with his eyes and ears closed.)

1180
00:45:57.951 --> 00:46:01.862
(It looks like
Mr. Tong dance competition.)

1181
00:46:03.692 --> 00:46:05.761
(Even after the attack of Mr. Tong,)

1182
00:46:05.761 --> 00:46:07.632
(he continues to count.)

1183
00:46:10.161 --> 00:46:11.331
You look desperate.

1184
00:46:12.072 --> 00:46:13.331
What's wrong with you all?

1185
00:46:13.402 --> 00:46:14.471
That's not even funny.

1186
00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:18.101
(I'll trade my eyes with someone
who hasn't seen this yet.)

1187
00:46:18.101 --> 00:46:19.241
He does that all the time.

1188
00:46:20.141 --> 00:46:21.272
(Bumpy)

1189
00:46:21.272 --> 00:46:22.281
He's good.

1190
00:46:22.281 --> 00:46:23.382
(It's hilarious.)

1191
00:46:25.681 --> 00:46:28.051
(Everyone's addicted to
Mr. Tong dance.)

1192
00:46:29.781 --> 00:46:31.851
(Graceful finish up
with Korean dance.)

1193
00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:34.051
- She's like a human cultural asset.
- "Human cultural asset."

1194
00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:37.121
(Now it's Jin Young's turn.)

1195
00:46:37.121 --> 00:46:38.931
I trust you, Jin Young.

1196
00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:41.362
Please. Don't go over 100 seconds,
Jin Young.

1197
00:46:41.362 --> 00:46:42.402
Don't count out loud.

1198
00:46:42.402 --> 00:46:43.502
Don't count out loud.

1199
00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.871
(Time stops.)

1200
00:46:46.871 --> 00:46:48.871
(Music stopped,)

1201
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:52.042
(but the penalty team isn't here.)

1202
00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:54.442
- What's going on?
- This is unbelievable.

1203
00:46:54.942 --> 00:46:55.982
(Did Su Geun team...)

1204
00:46:55.982 --> 00:46:58.781
(get 100 seconds?)

1205
00:46:58.851 --> 00:46:59.882
(Excluding the decimal point,)

1206
00:46:59.882 --> 00:47:02.322
(they only need to get 100 seconds.)

1207
00:47:02.322 --> 00:47:05.592
(Succeeded! 100.72 seconds!)

1208
00:47:05.752 --> 00:47:07.221
(Joy...)

1209
00:47:07.221 --> 00:47:09.022
(and sorrow)

1210
00:47:09.022 --> 00:47:10.922
No way. No way.

1211
00:47:10.922 --> 00:47:12.632
We won.

1212
00:47:12.632 --> 00:47:14.331
My goodness.

1213
00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:15.732
We won.

1214
00:47:16.701 --> 00:47:17.902
(Now they need to pick someone from
Team Hyun Moo for penalty.)

1215
00:47:17.902 --> 00:47:20.471
Point 65 seconds...

1216
00:47:20.672 --> 00:47:22.442
(They choose Hyun Moo
without hesitation.)

1217
00:47:22.442 --> 00:47:23.601
Wait. Listen.

1218
00:47:24.902 --> 00:47:27.712
(One should always see further.)

1219
00:47:27.712 --> 00:47:28.812
Let me make a suggestion.

1220
00:47:29.342 --> 00:47:35.551
(He didn't know back then...)

1221
00:47:35.551 --> 00:47:40.522
(that he'll be the annoying person.)

1222
00:47:40.792 --> 00:47:43.761
(He becomes the annoying person.)

1223
00:47:46.292 --> 00:47:47.761
Why me?

1224
00:47:48.062 --> 00:47:49.732
Why am I here?
It's for an annoying person.

1225
00:47:49.732 --> 00:47:51.062
Sit down.

1226
00:47:51.062 --> 00:47:52.801
Ask your team members.

1227
00:47:52.801 --> 00:47:53.871
This doesn't make sense.

1228
00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:55.402
What are you doing?

1229
00:47:55.402 --> 00:47:56.471
(The members are busy
carrying water with a bucket.)

1230
00:47:56.471 --> 00:47:58.272
- Give me one.
- What are you doing?

1231
00:47:58.272 --> 00:47:59.641
Come here. Take one.

1232
00:47:59.641 --> 00:48:00.911
Is this a bathhouse or what?

1233
00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:04.511
I'll be angry
if this doesn't go on air.

1234
00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:05.911
Don't say that.

1235
00:48:05.911 --> 00:48:07.112
(Don't worry about it.)

1236
00:48:07.112 --> 00:48:08.312
Grab the bottom.

1237
00:48:08.312 --> 00:48:09.351
Wait.

1238
00:48:09.351 --> 00:48:10.422
Do we get only one chance?

1239
00:48:10.422 --> 00:48:13.522
You have nature of enjoying
other people's agony.

1240
00:48:13.951 --> 00:48:16.362
(Today's big fun event)

1241
00:48:16.362 --> 00:48:17.692
We pour at once.

1242
00:48:17.692 --> 00:48:20.891
1, 2, 3.

1243
00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:22.862
(Water splashes.)

1244
00:48:22.862 --> 00:48:24.002
I don't think it'll be on air.

1245
00:48:25.701 --> 00:48:26.931
(The water bomb penalty isn't
that good due to faulty aim.)

1246
00:48:26.931 --> 00:48:28.371
You didn't aim him right.

1247
00:48:28.371 --> 00:48:29.701
No?

1248
00:48:29.701 --> 00:48:30.842
(There's one more.)

1249
00:48:32.772 --> 00:48:35.141
(We'll make you spotless.)

1250
00:48:36.442 --> 00:48:38.752
(From the popularity vote to
water bomb, it's been a long day.)

1251
00:48:39.212 --> 00:48:43.281
(It's fun watching.)

1252
00:48:43.281 --> 00:48:46.092
(Big smile on their face)

1253
00:48:48.462 --> 00:48:49.522
(Key Guide)

1254
00:48:49.522 --> 00:48:50.862
Key Guide is...

1255
00:48:50.862 --> 00:48:54.132
12 guides that will help you
find the Master Key.

1256
00:48:54.132 --> 00:48:55.502
- You all have read it.
- Yes.

1257
00:48:55.502 --> 00:48:59.101
Every time you win a game,

1258
00:48:59.101 --> 00:49:01.371
you'll get a chance
to win one of the Key Guide.

1259
00:49:02.141 --> 00:49:04.072
Let's decide which one
we'll receive.

1260
00:49:04.072 --> 00:49:05.141
- Yes.
- Yes.

1261
00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:06.942
Which one would you like?

1262
00:49:07.141 --> 00:49:08.141
- Pick one.
- Lie detector.

1263
00:49:08.141 --> 00:49:09.942
Let's settle down here.

1264
00:49:09.942 --> 00:49:11.482
- With what?
- Master Key?

1265
00:49:11.781 --> 00:49:12.882
That one.

1266
00:49:12.882 --> 00:49:15.351
"You can choose one of the keys
from the other team and check it."

1267
00:49:15.721 --> 00:49:16.721
- Just...
- This...

1268
00:49:16.721 --> 00:49:18.322
- settles it.
- one person's?

1269
00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:19.951
Then we should go with the dice.

1270
00:49:20.121 --> 00:49:21.121
We could get two.

1271
00:49:21.652 --> 00:49:24.022
"Regardless of the team,
you can choose three keys..."

1272
00:49:24.022 --> 00:49:26.292
"to find out the existence
of the Master Key."

1273
00:49:26.292 --> 00:49:28.502
Since the other team's wet,

1274
00:49:28.962 --> 00:49:30.831
electrocute them
with the lie detector.

1275
00:49:32.031 --> 00:49:33.232
(He's so creative.)

1276
00:49:33.232 --> 00:49:34.601
We could try it.

1277
00:49:34.601 --> 00:49:36.042
That's...

1278
00:49:36.672 --> 00:49:37.701
(Team Su Geun finally
made the decision.)

1279
00:49:37.701 --> 00:49:38.911
Because...

1280
00:49:39.112 --> 00:49:41.141
- Hurry up.
- Choose three people.

1281
00:49:41.141 --> 00:49:43.011
Please read out the one you chose.

1282
00:49:43.612 --> 00:49:46.051
"Regardless of the team,
you can choose three keys..."

1283
00:49:46.051 --> 00:49:47.851
"to find out the existence
of the Master Key."

1284
00:49:48.482 --> 00:49:50.581
Choose three people,

1285
00:49:50.581 --> 00:49:52.922
and you'll get to know whether
there is one or not.

1286
00:49:53.022 --> 00:49:54.121
Who would be the first one?

1287
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.592
It'd be Baek Hyun. No.

1288
00:49:56.692 --> 00:49:58.632
- It's not Baek Hyun.
- Pardon?

1289
00:49:58.632 --> 00:50:00.161
- I choose Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

1290
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:02.632
(Jong Min's suspicious
because he always lacks.)

1291
00:50:03.232 --> 00:50:05.002
I say Seong Wu.

1292
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:06.031
(Seong Wu did a good job
for the dance timer.)

1293
00:50:06.101 --> 00:50:08.402
We should pick those who don't
look like it...

1294
00:50:08.402 --> 00:50:09.471
and eliminate them.

1295
00:50:09.471 --> 00:50:12.042
- Otherwise, they'll confuse us.
- Okay.

1296
00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:14.042
- What about Hyun Moo?
- Let's go with him.

1297
00:50:14.042 --> 00:50:16.942
Jong Min, Seong Wu, and Hyun Moo.
Three people.

1298
00:50:16.942 --> 00:50:18.241
Bring your keys please.

1299
00:50:18.451 --> 00:50:20.451
This is quite a blow.
This shouldn't be happening now.

1300
00:50:23.982 --> 00:50:26.551
(Is there a Master Key owner
among them?)

1301
00:50:26.551 --> 00:50:27.592
That's yours.

1302
00:50:28.862 --> 00:50:30.022
He looks nervous.

1303
00:50:33.491 --> 00:50:36.931
Hyun Moo, Jong Min,
and Seong Wu's...

1304
00:50:36.931 --> 00:50:38.002
You're going to regret it.

1305
00:50:38.002 --> 00:50:39.732
Give me the Master Key please.

1306
00:50:39.732 --> 00:50:40.772
(If there is a Master Key, it will
tell whether there is one or not.)

1307
00:50:40.772 --> 00:50:43.402
Put Hyun Moo in number one.

1308
00:50:45.002 --> 00:50:46.812
- There's no number.
- Still.

1309
00:50:50.241 --> 00:50:52.351
Jong Min.
Make it easy to give it back.

1310
00:50:53.051 --> 00:50:54.051
Seong Wu.

1311
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:55.121
(The selection of
the first Key Guide is over.)

1312
00:50:55.121 --> 00:50:57.482
What's your strategy, Su Geun?

1313
00:50:57.482 --> 00:50:59.522
Did you add someone
who isn't highly likely?

1314
00:50:59.522 --> 00:51:01.692
I added someone
who isn't highly likely,

1315
00:51:01.692 --> 00:51:03.161
but there will be one for sure.

1316
00:51:03.161 --> 00:51:04.692
- I see.
- Right.

1317
00:51:04.692 --> 00:51:06.362
- There's one for a scheme.
- Yes.

1318
00:51:06.362 --> 00:51:08.331
- There's one for a scheme.
- I'm curious. I can't wait.

1319
00:51:08.902 --> 00:51:10.002
We'll open it now.

1320
00:51:10.002 --> 00:51:11.732
(Su Geun team's reaction
will be good evidence.)

1321
00:51:13.072 --> 00:51:15.471
(Three people's keys
on the judgment)

1322
00:51:17.101 --> 00:51:19.112
(Hyun Moo kept an impassive face.)

1323
00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:22.411
(Seong Wu had a mysterious smile.)

1324
00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:26.011
(Jong Min was such a bad actor.)

1325
00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:31.922
(Is there a Master Key owner
among them?)

1326
00:51:31.991 --> 00:51:35.292
Is there a Master Key
among these keys?

1327
00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:42.562
(Is there a Master Key among them?)

1328
00:51:43.962 --> 00:51:47.371
(What's the result?)

1329
00:52:03.395 --> 00:52:09.859
<font color="#80ffff">[Kocowa Ver] SBS  E01 Master Key</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>
From 00:51:48 till 00:52:22 no translation from KOCOWA

1330
00:52:22.757 --> 00:52:25.328
(Is there a Master Key owner
among them?)

1331
00:52:26.959 --> 00:52:30.260
Is there a Master Key
among these keys?

1332
00:52:32.229 --> 00:52:37.530
(Is there a Master Key among them?)

1333
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:42.339
(What's the result?)

1334
00:52:48.209 --> 00:52:51.780
(None of them has a Master Key.)

1335
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:55.049
(Okay, great!)

1336
00:52:59.189 --> 00:53:00.560
(What have they seen?)

1337
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.919
This way.

1338
00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.319
I bet it wasn't worth it.

1339
00:53:03.319 --> 00:53:05.760
This is why you can never tell.

1340
00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:06.959
They're such good actors.

1341
00:53:06.959 --> 00:53:08.999
- I'll give you back the keys.
- There's none.

1342
00:53:08.999 --> 00:53:12.930
- Were you certain this time?
- Of course. I picked three people.

1343
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:14.740
(Then now...)

1344
00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:18.269
(they've found out that these 3
people aren't the one.)

1345
00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:22.910
(Who has the Master Key?)

1346
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:27.519
(Who has the Master Key?)

1347
00:53:27.649 --> 00:53:31.319
Like I said earlier, this show
is not about winning.

1348
00:53:31.319 --> 00:53:33.089
- Really?
- Who has the Master Key?

1349
00:53:33.089 --> 00:53:35.120
Games are all about winning.

1350
00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.319
- It's about winning.
- No.

1351
00:53:36.319 --> 00:53:39.990
Games are just for fun.
It's for the participants.

1352
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:42.399
But in the end, we must find
the owner of the Master Key.

1353
00:53:42.499 --> 00:53:44.269
That's all I'm thinking about.

1354
00:53:44.269 --> 00:53:46.740
You need to win the game
to win a hint.

1355
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.140
- The guy is here.
- This is why we lose.

1356
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.540
That's right.

1357
00:53:50.609 --> 00:53:52.040
I don't care.

1358
00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.310
He said he doesn't care.

1359
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:55.609
- How could you say that?
- I don't care.

1360
00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.979
This show is about finding
the owner of the Master Key.

1361
00:53:57.979 --> 00:53:59.749
- He's the boss.
- Okay, then...

1362
00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:02.419
the last game was physical,

1363
00:54:02.419 --> 00:54:04.049
but you need to use your brain
for this game.

1364
00:54:04.049 --> 00:54:05.720
There are quizzes that...

1365
00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:08.459
Watchers left on comments.

1366
00:54:10.229 --> 00:54:12.530
(Watchers visit
the Master Key homepage,)

1367
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:14.760
(and imagine the impression
of the player)

1368
00:54:15.729 --> 00:54:18.470
- These people...
- Watchers...

1369
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:21.640
They are from Watchers.
They wrote the answer.

1370
00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:24.269
(Questions and answers)

1371
00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:29.740
(With a lot of support and love,
Watcher Quiz is completed.)

1372
00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.910
Except for two bosses, rest of you
will sit on a wheel chair.

1373
00:54:33.209 --> 00:54:35.450
When one of the bosses
give out a quiz,

1374
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:37.890
you need to hurry up,
and answer the question.

1375
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.089
You need to line up
to answer the question.

1376
00:54:41.319 --> 00:54:43.359
- Do we need to run fast?
- Yes.

1377
00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:45.629
We're all smart, but you...

1378
00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:49.629
Black team. Could you please
stop discussing?

1379
00:54:49.629 --> 00:54:51.899
They lost because they discuss.

1380
00:54:52.169 --> 00:54:53.669
It's because they discuss.

1381
00:54:53.669 --> 00:54:55.540
- Okay.
- You don't have to get it.

1382
00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.910
People on this side keep shooting...

1383
00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:01.209
Let's try our best this time.

1384
00:55:01.339 --> 00:55:03.379
Nothing's easy.

1385
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:07.519
The question will be delivered
in real time.

1386
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.249
We don't have any questions in hand.

1387
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:13.560
Will there be only 1 question
between the 2?

1388
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:15.959
You never know where you have to go.

1389
00:55:15.959 --> 00:55:18.729
You go with Bo Ah.
Go that way, Baek Hyun.

1390
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:20.700
- Which direction?
- The quiz is here.

1391
00:55:20.859 --> 00:55:22.100
We shouldn't stay together.

1392
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.999
Focus please.

1393
00:55:26.229 --> 00:55:27.700
Here's the quiz.

1394
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.269
It's about Jong Min.

1395
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:34.280
What does Jong Min...

1396
00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:39.280
say the most to his manager?

1397
00:55:40.379 --> 00:55:41.819
- Let's go first.
- Do we have to go?

1398
00:55:41.819 --> 00:55:42.879
Me?

1399
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:44.519
Me?

1400
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.720
- Me?
- Say "Answer."

1401
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.390
You get nervous when it's about you.

1402
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:51.859
What's wrong with this?

1403
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:54.459
- Now...
- Answer.

1404
00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.100
- Bring me water.
- Wrong.

1405
00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.569
Hey. What was that?

1406
00:55:59.569 --> 00:56:01.439
I get my own water.

1407
00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:03.269
"Bring me water."

1408
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:05.339
- Answer.
- Go ahead.

1409
00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:06.510
When will this end?

1410
00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.680
When will this end?

1411
00:56:08.939 --> 00:56:10.280
That's Lee Gyeong Gyu.

1412
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.649
- That's funny.
- Next.

1413
00:56:13.149 --> 00:56:14.379
I'm not like that.

1414
00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.249
That's unbelievable.

1415
00:56:17.319 --> 00:56:18.390
- Answer.
- Go ahead.

1416
00:56:18.649 --> 00:56:20.419
Don't tell the boss
about this festival.

1417
00:56:20.519 --> 00:56:23.260
This festival...
That's what you say.

1418
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:24.660
It's you.

1419
00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.260
- Don't lie.
- I'm not you.

1420
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.359
I was pretty sure.

1421
00:56:27.359 --> 00:56:31.129
This is what the audience thinks
Jong Min would say the most...

1422
00:56:31.129 --> 00:56:33.129
- to his manager.
- Oh, not the one I said?

1423
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.010
Jong Min say
the things you said so far,

1424
00:56:37.839 --> 00:56:38.910
but it wasn't close.

1425
00:56:39.569 --> 00:56:41.939
Are you guessing your own question?
Come and try, then.

1426
00:56:41.939 --> 00:56:44.209
What do you say the most often
to your manager?

1427
00:56:44.209 --> 00:56:45.350
What is it?

1428
00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:47.049
(Jong Min's own impression
about him)

1429
00:56:47.049 --> 00:56:48.180
You can go home early.

1430
00:56:48.319 --> 00:56:49.580
You can go home early.

1431
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:52.519
Are you sure you said that before?

1432
00:56:52.519 --> 00:56:54.319
- Are you sure you said that before?
- I am.

1433
00:56:54.319 --> 00:56:56.589
That's wrong. You never
let your manager rest.

1434
00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:59.229
- He got his own question wrong.
- You have nothing to say.

1435
00:56:59.359 --> 00:57:00.530
Here's the hint.

1436
00:57:00.859 --> 00:57:04.169
Think of the impression you have
about Jong Min.

1437
00:57:04.169 --> 00:57:05.769
Right. That's what the audience has.

1438
00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:08.700
Think of the impression of Jong Min.

1439
00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.740
- Answer.
- The impression the audience has.

1440
00:57:11.069 --> 00:57:12.910
- What is it?
- I really can't tell.

1441
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:14.109
- What is it?
- Answer!

1442
00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:16.080
The impression the audience has.

1443
00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:19.649
What's her number?

1444
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:21.950
"What's her number?"

1445
00:57:22.249 --> 00:57:23.280
The audience...

1446
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:24.649
What's her number?

1447
00:57:24.649 --> 00:57:28.060
(The dignity of the grand award
winner shatters.)

1448
00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.189
Hey!

1449
00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:34.459
He's so sarcastic.

1450
00:57:34.459 --> 00:57:36.399
The impression you have of Jong Min.

1451
00:57:36.769 --> 00:57:39.169
That's correct, but it's wrong.

1452
00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:41.999
Hey, I'm not like that.

1453
00:57:42.999 --> 00:57:44.740
I'm right this time.
I've heard it many times before.

1454
00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.240
- What is it?
- I've heard him saying it.

1455
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.240
Go ahead.

1456
00:57:47.609 --> 00:57:48.780
Are you ignoring me?

1457
00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:51.049
"Are you ignoring me?" That's close.

1458
00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:52.950
- Right? I knew it.
- Answer!

1459
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:55.249
"Are you ignoring me?"

1460
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.290
- It's close.
- Yes.

1461
00:57:57.390 --> 00:58:01.019
- "Are you ignoring me?"
- Hurry up.

1462
00:58:01.019 --> 00:58:02.189
- Answer.
- Yes?

1463
00:58:02.189 --> 00:58:04.330
Do you think I'm ridiculous?

1464
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:07.160
"Do you think I'm ridiculous?"
That was pretty close.

1465
00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:09.499
It's wrong. You got that part right.

1466
00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:11.069
- "Do you think."
- My gosh.

1467
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.100
I got it.

1468
00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.600
- The impression you have.
- I got it.

1469
00:58:15.669 --> 00:58:17.109
- Answer!
- Yes!

1470
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.169
I wonder what he'd say.

1471
00:58:19.269 --> 00:58:22.209
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1472
00:58:22.209 --> 00:58:25.310
(What would Jong Min say to
his manager most often?)

1473
00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:26.510
It's close.

1474
00:58:26.819 --> 00:58:27.950
It's correct.

1475
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:29.180
(Is that the Watcher's answer?)

1476
00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.450
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1477
00:58:31.519 --> 00:58:33.519
It's 99 percent correct.

1478
00:58:34.419 --> 00:58:35.790
What's the answer?

1479
00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.390
- Answer!
- It's 99 percent close.

1480
00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:41.430
- You have to get it exactly.
- Do you think I'm a fool?

1481
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:43.100
Do you think I'm a fool?

1482
00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:45.930
(Is that the impression of Jong Min
the Watchers have?)

1483
00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:47.370
I think it's correct.

1484
00:58:47.499 --> 00:58:48.899
Do you think I'm a fool?

1485
00:58:49.439 --> 00:58:50.640
Correct.

1486
00:58:51.439 --> 00:58:52.569
Correct.

1487
00:58:52.569 --> 00:58:57.049
(Hyun Moo team wins the 1st round
of Watcher Quiz.)

1488
00:58:57.049 --> 00:58:58.810
(Do you think I'm a fool?)

1489
00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:00.549
"Do you think I'm a food?"

1490
00:59:00.819 --> 00:59:01.979
We finally got it.

1491
00:59:02.249 --> 00:59:03.549
Good job.

1492
00:59:03.549 --> 00:59:05.019
Am I supposed to be happy?

1493
00:59:05.019 --> 00:59:06.959
- Why are you happy?
- Because he got it.

1494
00:59:06.959 --> 00:59:08.890
- Do you really say that often?
- Our team should win.

1495
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:10.629
- No. I don't say that.
- Really?

1496
00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.729
- He thinks you're a fool, right?
- Yes.

1497
00:59:13.859 --> 00:59:14.859
He answered it.

1498
00:59:14.899 --> 00:59:16.459
Then the current...

1499
00:59:17.999 --> 00:59:19.470
(Su Geun got the 2nd question.)

1500
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:21.600
The next...

1501
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:24.970
is about Baek Hyun.

1502
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:27.240
- I think I can answer it.
- What would...

1503
00:59:27.709 --> 00:59:29.109
Baek Hyun do...

1504
00:59:29.609 --> 00:59:33.209
if there's no toilet paper
in the restroom?

1505
00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.220
What kind of question is that?

1506
00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.249
What is that?

1507
00:59:36.519 --> 00:59:37.890
- What's this?
- What is this?

1508
00:59:38.689 --> 00:59:39.720
(She runs.)

1509
00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.189
- When there's no toilet paper...
- What's this?

1510
00:59:42.189 --> 00:59:43.689
(She trips.)

1511
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.859
(What do the Watchers think
of Baek Hyun?)

1512
00:59:44.859 --> 00:59:47.499
Wait. Someone's here.

1513
00:59:47.629 --> 00:59:50.100
Bo Ah. What would Baek Hyun do...

1514
00:59:50.299 --> 00:59:52.330
If you watched Baek Hyun...

1515
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:57.709
when he was on variety shows,
this would be easy.

1516
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:59.010
The answer is?

1517
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.709
- Wipe with his hand.
- What was that?

1518
01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.680
Wipe with his hand.

1519
01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.749
- What was that?
- My goodness.

1520
01:00:05.979 --> 01:00:08.780
- Really?
- What do you think of me?

1521
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:10.189
Too bad.

1522
01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:12.019
There's nothing to feel bad about.

1523
01:00:12.019 --> 01:00:13.350
Is that from your experience?

1524
01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.760
I thought this would bring you
to me.

1525
01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.830
You're my lady. Don't you get it?

1526
01:00:21.229 --> 01:00:22.999
- Impersonation.
- No.

1527
01:00:23.769 --> 01:00:25.600
- That's all.
- He's good at impersonating.

1528
01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.839
- I know.
- Okay. Jong Min.

1529
01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:29.370
Jong Min.

1530
01:00:29.439 --> 01:00:31.240
- I think I know.
- He would...

1531
01:00:31.339 --> 01:00:34.080
- alter his voice...
- How?

1532
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:37.549
- as if it's not him,
- Okay.

1533
01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:39.950
- and ask for toilet paper.
- For example?

1534
01:00:40.479 --> 01:00:42.780
Get me toilet paper.

1535
01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:45.049
That's so wrong.

1536
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:47.589
(His impersonation
makes people laugh.)

1537
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:49.189
- That's so wrong.
- It's so wrong.

1538
01:00:49.519 --> 01:00:50.930
It wasn't right in the first place,

1539
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:52.689
but "Bring me toilet paper"
is so wrong.

1540
01:00:52.729 --> 01:00:54.160
Now.

1541
01:00:54.299 --> 01:00:56.459
- I know.
- Jin Young's good at this.

1542
01:00:56.769 --> 01:00:58.930
- I'd do Lee Jung Jae...
- I'd do Lee Jung Jae...

1543
01:00:59.569 --> 01:01:02.240
- impersonation.
- He'd impersonate.

1544
01:01:04.209 --> 01:01:06.169
Wrong. You're getting there.

1545
01:01:06.209 --> 01:01:07.640
- Me.
- You're almost there.

1546
01:01:07.879 --> 01:01:09.640
Okay. Come out.

1547
01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:13.080
Get up and try your best
Lee Jung Jae impersonation.

1548
01:01:13.749 --> 01:01:16.680
(He clears his voice.)

1549
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.850
Wrong. He doesn't clear
his voice like that.

1550
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:21.120
- I was clearing my voice.
- Oh, you were?

1551
01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.790
Then you must tell me.

1552
01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:24.260
Ready.

1553
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:26.589
I can't see from here.

1554
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:28.930
Do you see that
there's no toilet paper here?

1555
01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:31.269
Please give me toilet paper.

1556
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:34.470
- Your joke has gone too far.
- Oh, great.

1557
01:01:36.399 --> 01:01:38.640
(Lee Jung Jae's best line)

1558
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.780
- Your joke has gone too far.
- Oh, great.

1559
01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.280
(Is that the answer?)

1560
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.310
- One more line.
- That was close.

1561
01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:47.720
He's shooting
a traditional drama here.

1562
01:01:49.879 --> 01:01:50.919
What is it?

1563
01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:53.290
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1564
01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:54.490
Hey, Brother.

1565
01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:57.060
- Brother?
- It could be a woman outside.

1566
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.729
Hey... Hey, ma'am.

1567
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.799
Do you have toilet paper?

1568
01:02:02.399 --> 01:02:04.769
- Answer.
- Please try your best.

1569
01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.200
Is there anyone outside?

1570
01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.970
Is there anyone outside?

1571
01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:10.370
- What did you say?
- Is there anyone outside?

1572
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:11.939
- Is?
- There anyone outside?

1573
01:02:11.939 --> 01:02:14.180
- The three letters...
- I think that's the answer.

1574
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.609
Is there...

1575
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.979
That's three letters.
Anyone outside?

1576
01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:19.450
Correct!

1577
01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:20.580
(Correct!)

1578
01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:23.919
The red team answered it.

1579
01:02:23.919 --> 01:02:25.919
(He'd say, "Is there anyone
outside?" in Lee Jung Jae's voice.)

1580
01:02:25.919 --> 01:02:28.490
- I think it'd be Jong Min again.
- We're winning again.

1581
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:30.160
I think my team's really great.

1582
01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.260
(Score 1 for each team)

1583
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.830
It's about Daniel.

1584
01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:35.330
There's a problem with Daniel?

1585
01:02:35.499 --> 01:02:39.830
What would he say before
he kisses a woman?

1586
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.269
Answer!

1587
01:02:43.439 --> 01:02:45.540
- Jin Young.
- What was it?

1588
01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:47.410
Line up please.

1589
01:02:47.709 --> 01:02:50.950
What would he say
before he kisses...

1590
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:53.049
- a woman?
- What would he say?

1591
01:02:53.049 --> 01:02:54.249
How can you...

1592
01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:57.419
There's a Watcher's answer.

1593
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:59.450
- Did you kiss a woman?
- How do you do it?

1594
01:02:59.589 --> 01:03:00.959
How do you do it?

1595
01:03:01.089 --> 01:03:03.459
I don't know. I really don't know.

1596
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.729
There's a Watcher's answer.

1597
01:03:05.729 --> 01:03:07.260
Jin Young.

1598
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.669
- I love you.
- I love you before the kiss?

1599
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:13.030
(He's shy.)

1600
01:03:14.569 --> 01:03:16.970
- I love you.
- I love you before the kiss?

1601
01:03:17.339 --> 01:03:18.439
Wrong.

1602
01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:22.839
- What is it? Even I can't tell.
- It's about Daniel.

1603
01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.410
Since you know Daniel the best...

1604
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:26.979
- Answer!
- Answer.

1605
01:03:28.249 --> 01:03:29.419
You have to get it.

1606
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.790
You're so beautiful.

1607
01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:33.490
You're so beautiful.

1608
01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:36.419
- Say that again.
- He's using dialect.

1609
01:03:36.419 --> 01:03:37.560
Say it again.

1610
01:03:37.729 --> 01:03:38.729
I see.

1611
01:03:38.729 --> 01:03:40.100
You have to speak in dialect.

1612
01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.399
Where are you originally from?

1613
01:03:41.399 --> 01:03:43.299
- I am from Busan.
- He's from Busan.

1614
01:03:43.299 --> 01:03:44.499
You're almost there.

1615
01:03:44.499 --> 01:03:46.129
- You're almost there.
- What did he say?

1616
01:03:46.129 --> 01:03:49.240
Baby... I mean, baby.

1617
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:50.569
Why are you so pretty?

1618
01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:53.310
- Baby.
- Baby?

1619
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.839
Baby.

1620
01:03:55.839 --> 01:03:57.149
Why are you so pretty?

1621
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:58.410
Wait. He's from Busan.

1622
01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:01.049
That's not it. You were close.

1623
01:04:01.049 --> 01:04:02.080
- You were close.
- What did he say?

1624
01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.149
- What is it? I don't even know.
- What did he say?

1625
01:04:04.149 --> 01:04:08.060
Seong Wu said it a while ago.

1626
01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.959
- He said the word.
- What did he say?

1627
01:04:09.959 --> 01:04:11.160
Daniel, you should try it.

1628
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.560
- You should try it.
- I don't even know.

1629
01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.700
What is it?

1630
01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.160
- Try it.
- What would he say?

1631
01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.999
- Here.
- You got something here, Baby.

1632
01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:18.169
Say that again.

1633
01:04:18.169 --> 01:04:19.970
You got something here, Baby.

1634
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:21.100
You got...

1635
01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.600
You got something here, Baby.

1636
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:24.410
- You got something...
- Here, Baby.

1637
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:25.740
You got something here, Baby.

1638
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.180
You got one more word.

1639
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.740
- What is it?
- You need to shorten it.

1640
01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.680
- Okay.
- You need to shorten it.

1641
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.280
- Wait!
- We got it!

1642
01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.720
Wait! Give that to me!

1643
01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.019
(Everyone fights for the mic.)

1644
01:04:36.019 --> 01:04:37.620
(Everyone wants the mic.)

1645
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:39.490
- No.
- I'll give it a try.

1646
01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:41.160
What is it?

1647
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.120
- I think I know.
- I got the answer.

1648
01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.189
Jin Young.

1649
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:46.799
You got something, Baby.

1650
01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:48.399
- Say it again.
- That's the same thing.

1651
01:04:48.499 --> 01:04:50.129
- You got...
- What did he say?

1652
01:04:50.129 --> 01:04:51.970
- What did he say?
- Say it again.

1653
01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:53.499
- You got...
- You got...

1654
01:04:53.499 --> 01:04:55.569
You got something, Baby.

1655
01:04:55.569 --> 01:04:57.970
You got it.

1656
01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:00.379
(Team Su Geun wins
the Watcher Quiz.)

1657
01:05:00.379 --> 01:05:01.609
(Thank you for
participating in the quiz.)

1658
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:03.850
- "You got something, Baby."
- That was the answer.

1659
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:04.910
Those were the exact words.

1660
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:08.479
"You got something, Baby."

1661
01:05:08.479 --> 01:05:10.249
That's lovely.

1662
01:05:10.249 --> 01:05:12.089
(Daniel reenacts the moment.)

1663
01:05:12.089 --> 01:05:13.220
Baby.

1664
01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:18.530
(Baby)

1665
01:05:21.799 --> 01:05:23.430
You got something.

1666
01:05:25.629 --> 01:05:27.470
(He reenacts it for the Watcher
who came up with it.)

1667
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:29.769
(But he's embarrassed.)

1668
01:05:29.769 --> 01:05:31.510
(He gets punished
after getting the answer right.)

1669
01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:35.979
I am sorry.

1670
01:05:35.979 --> 01:05:38.010
(Team Su Geun gets
the 2nd Key Guide.)

1671
01:05:39.379 --> 01:05:41.220
(Key Guide)

1672
01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.049
Which one?

1673
01:05:43.049 --> 01:05:45.049
(Choose one person from
the other team and check his key.)

1674
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:48.089
- Okay. We've decided.
- Is that right?

1675
01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.490
We were very thorough.

1676
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:53.899
Daniel and Jin Young are
very sharp.

1677
01:05:54.399 --> 01:05:56.769
While playing the game,

1678
01:05:57.169 --> 01:06:00.200
even while dancing, they read
the other team members' faces.

1679
01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.169
- Really?
- So everyone agreed...

1680
01:06:02.169 --> 01:06:04.169
to choose this unexpected person.

1681
01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.439
On the count of three,
please step forward.

1682
01:06:06.439 --> 01:06:07.609
You'll be surprised.

1683
01:06:07.609 --> 01:06:09.979
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

1684
01:06:09.979 --> 01:06:11.609
- Henry.
- Henry?

1685
01:06:11.649 --> 01:06:12.749
(Team Su Geun
points out Henry.)

1686
01:06:12.749 --> 01:06:13.819
- Why?
- Why me?

1687
01:06:13.819 --> 01:06:15.749
They said you seemed...

1688
01:06:15.979 --> 01:06:19.290
like you were
on a different shoot.

1689
01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:21.019
(Let's look back.)

1690
01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:23.060
(Since the key checking
at the Room of Fate,)

1691
01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:24.530
(he's been constantly making
exaggerated faces.)

1692
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:26.760
- His face changed.
- No. No.

1693
01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.399
(For this reason, he got away
from the suspicion.)

1694
01:06:29.129 --> 01:06:31.330
- He might be acting.
- I'm so disappointed.

1695
01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:34.569
(He said he had the Master Key.)

1696
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:36.839
(Henry behaved suspiciously
from time to time.)

1697
01:06:36.839 --> 01:06:39.410
- No.
- You don't seem to know him.

1698
01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:41.410
- That's how he is.
- Whenever he's in a shoot,

1699
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:42.510
he looks as if
he's in another shoot.

1700
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:44.680
We felt it after...

1701
01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.249
Wait. I can't believe this.
I tried really hard.

1702
01:06:47.249 --> 01:06:48.580
- Henry.
- I worked very hard.

1703
01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:50.249
Bring your key, Henry.

1704
01:06:50.249 --> 01:06:51.490
- Bring it.
- What have I done?

1705
01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:53.189
- I can't believe this.
- Whenever he's in a shoot, he...

1706
01:06:53.189 --> 01:06:54.919
- looks as if he's in another shoot.
- That's how Henry is.

1707
01:06:54.919 --> 01:06:56.760
How can you waste
this precious opportunity?

1708
01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.060
- Only we know.
- Henry is always like that.

1709
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.700
Give us the key.

1710
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.100
- We...
- Here.

1711
01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.299
(They got the chance
to check Henry's key.)

1712
01:07:05.729 --> 01:07:07.939
- Wait.
- Let's say it together.

1713
01:07:07.939 --> 01:07:09.700
- Wait. I'm so worried.
- Let's say it together.

1714
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:11.040
1, 2, 3.

1715
01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.709
- Is this key the Master Key?
- Is this key the Master Key?

1716
01:07:14.939 --> 01:07:18.879
(Finally, the Judgement Cabinet
doors open.)

1717
01:07:18.879 --> 01:07:23.350
(Team Su Geun is certain
that Henry's key is the Master Key.)

1718
01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:25.549
(Team Hyun Moo believes that
they have made a mistake.)

1719
01:07:27.519 --> 01:07:30.290
(What result
will this choice bring?)

1720
01:07:30.359 --> 01:07:31.760
Please show the result.

1721
01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:34.100
(They confirm that
it is the Master Key.)

1722
01:07:35.899 --> 01:07:36.970
(Great.)

1723
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.370
Look at his face.

1724
01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:39.629
(The Master Key is revealed.)

1725
01:07:39.629 --> 01:07:41.799
(Team Su Geun gains
a strong advantage.)

1726
01:07:41.799 --> 01:07:43.810
(They retain the poker face.)

1727
01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.410
(No way.)

1728
01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:49.339
You are unbelievable.

1729
01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.109
What's going on, Jin Young?

1730
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:53.680
- They've got the wrong key.
- This is crazy.

1731
01:07:53.919 --> 01:07:55.080
- It's not the Master Key.
- What's going on?

1732
01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.220
(Team Hyun Moo
doesn't know the result.)

1733
01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.419
Wait. Baek Hyun...

1734
01:07:58.749 --> 01:08:00.890
(The owner of the Master Key
faces a crisis.)

1735
01:08:03.319 --> 01:08:05.430
(He got the Master Key.)

1736
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:06.899
(But he couldn't handle
the pressure.)

1737
01:08:07.999 --> 01:08:11.269
(You are looking at the face
of the Master Key owner.)

1738
01:08:14.769 --> 01:08:16.370
(He feels bad.)

1739
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:18.640
They look...
They look disappointed.

1740
01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:21.609
Take the Master Key, Henry.

1741
01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:22.879
(He tries to seem calm.)

1742
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:28.649
Salute the Master.

1743
01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:31.350
- Master.
- Master.

1744
01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:33.760
(What will happen to Henry now?)

1745
01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:37.260
- His ears turned red.
- It's not me.

1746
01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:40.600
- What's up with your ears?
- His ears turned red.

1747
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.729
(Team Su Geun succeeds
to gain 1 Master Key.)

1748
01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:45.069
I don't think he has it.

1749
01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.740
- He doesn't have it, does he?
- He doesn't have it.

1750
01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.499
- It doesn't look like he has it.
- He hasn't gotten it.

1751
01:08:49.499 --> 01:08:52.410
Let's say we saw
Henry's Master Key.

1752
01:08:52.410 --> 01:08:54.339
What kind of a face
would you make?

1753
01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:55.709
It wasn't the Master Key,
was it?

1754
01:08:58.749 --> 01:09:00.720
(They go outside
for the last match.)

1755
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.720
- Let's go.
- This is the last one.

1756
01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.450
It's nice that we get to
move around different place.

1757
01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:05.620
- Yes.
- This is lovely.

1758
01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:08.290
We get to travel from
afternoon to morning.

1759
01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:09.359
Finally, it's the afternoon.

1760
01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:11.089
Don't you feel like
you woke up from a sleep?

1761
01:09:11.089 --> 01:09:12.830
Jong Min, you are losing right now.

1762
01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:14.430
- Hurry.
- Right.

1763
01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.229
Clothes will dry
quickly in this weather.

1764
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:19.000
What's the next game?

1765
01:09:19.469 --> 01:09:21.899
(Umbrella Flower Has Blossomed)

1766
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:25.340
One female player from each team
will play the game.

1767
01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:29.639
They will guess the name of
the team member under an umbrella.

1768
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:33.179
If the player eliminates
all the members of the other team,

1769
01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:37.250
or if her teammate hugs her,
they will win.

1770
01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:39.219
Wow, I like this game.

1771
01:09:39.219 --> 01:09:40.920
Everyone is going to
go crazy about this.

1772
01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.620
We're going to go crazy.

1773
01:09:42.889 --> 01:09:45.130
Let's ask her. Who would be...

1774
01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:47.960
- your Prince Charming?
- That's so childish.

1775
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.530
- Consider us too.
- She has to choose one of us.

1776
01:09:50.530 --> 01:09:52.670
- Me?
- This is for fun.

1777
01:09:52.929 --> 01:09:54.040
You.

1778
01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.540
Me? Did you hear that?

1779
01:09:58.109 --> 01:09:59.840
(Don't you dare challenge me!)

1780
01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.080
(He's offended.)

1781
01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.750
She will never choose you.

1782
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:05.550
Why would you try to
compete with me? Am I your rival?

1783
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:07.649
- No.
- Why am I your rival?

1784
01:10:07.649 --> 01:10:09.819
I nearly bowed to you
because of the beard.

1785
01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.149
- His beard keeps growing.
- I shaved at 4am.

1786
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:14.889
I normally shave twice a day.

1787
01:10:14.889 --> 01:10:17.559
- Han Na, who would you want?
- Among them?

1788
01:10:17.559 --> 01:10:19.689
Yes. Who do I want to lift me?

1789
01:10:19.689 --> 01:10:21.259
Who do you want to be hugged by?

1790
01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.359
- Who would I want to be hugged?
- Be honest.

1791
01:10:23.359 --> 01:10:24.370
Choose one.

1792
01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:26.569
Daniel.

1793
01:10:26.569 --> 01:10:28.639
You should choose someone
from your team.

1794
01:10:28.639 --> 01:10:30.740
She didn't understand it.
She didn't get the question.

1795
01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.269
- You didn't get it, did you?
- That's not it.

1796
01:10:32.769 --> 01:10:34.979
- You clearly said...
- I knew she wouldn't get it.

1797
01:10:34.979 --> 01:10:36.540
- You said 10 people would come.
- I'll rephrase the question.

1798
01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:37.950
- You said 10 people.
- I will rephrase the question.

1799
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:40.219
- Who's your type?
- No. No.

1800
01:10:40.219 --> 01:10:42.019
(This is not what I planned.)

1801
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:44.250
(So we prepared
an edited version of it.)

1802
01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:48.660
(Shall we talk about your ideal
type of man under the warm sun?)

1803
01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:53.599
(There are many great men here.)

1804
01:10:53.599 --> 01:10:56.000
(But I only like Daniel.)

1805
01:10:57.370 --> 01:10:59.399
(It's the drama "Master Key".)

1806
01:10:59.399 --> 01:11:02.000
(The end)

1807
01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.840
(The 3rd game starts.)

1808
01:11:05.639 --> 01:11:07.109
- Let's take off your socks.
- Take off your socks.

1809
01:11:07.109 --> 01:11:08.840
- Take off your socks.
- Let's roll up our pants.

1810
01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.080
Okay.

1811
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:11.750
We all look like models
for a jean brand.

1812
01:11:12.109 --> 01:11:14.250
Right. We look like a team.

1813
01:11:14.349 --> 01:11:15.719
(She watches them.)

1814
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:18.849
(She stares at them.)

1815
01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.189
- Let's take off your socks.
- Take off your socks.

1816
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:21.920
- She's looking.
- Cho Bo Ah.

1817
01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.660
You can't look, Bo Ah.

1818
01:11:23.729 --> 01:11:26.530
If you keep doing that, we will
think you're interested in men.

1819
01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:28.500
I am very interested in men.

1820
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.530
You keep looking, Bo Ah.

1821
01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:32.899
(She laughs.)

1822
01:11:32.899 --> 01:11:34.939
- She keeps looking.
- Bo Ah keeps looking.

1823
01:11:34.939 --> 01:11:37.469
Where are we going?

1824
01:11:37.469 --> 01:11:38.870
Why did you go forward?

1825
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:40.740
Stop getting ready to run.

1826
01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.910
You are young.

1827
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:43.679
Why do you keep moving forward?

1828
01:11:43.679 --> 01:11:44.750
Go, Team Hyun Moo!

1829
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:45.809
Go, team!

1830
01:11:45.809 --> 01:11:47.479
Let's finish the game,
Team Su Geun!

1831
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:49.149
Yes!

1832
01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:51.019
Even elementary school
students watch this show.

1833
01:11:51.019 --> 01:11:52.019
Please stand on the starting line.

1834
01:11:52.019 --> 01:11:53.590
Let's play fairly.

1835
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:55.719
So please stand
on the starting line.

1836
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.229
(The player doesn't know
who's behind each umbrella.)

1837
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:58.559
- Let's play fairly.
- Okay.

1838
01:11:58.559 --> 01:12:00.359
Ready. Start.

1839
01:12:02.359 --> 01:12:03.830
(They run.)

1840
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:05.330
These rubber shoes
are tough to run with.

1841
01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.240
These rubber shoes...

1842
01:12:08.969 --> 01:12:13.309
(Get the big umbrella that will
hide your identity.)

1843
01:12:13.309 --> 01:12:15.840
(Run faster...)

1844
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.280
(and run more excitingly.)

1845
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:19.780
(He's running barefoot.)

1846
01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.649
I'm late.

1847
01:12:21.649 --> 01:12:23.050
(Daniel gets the sky blue umbrella.)

1848
01:12:23.050 --> 01:12:24.689
- It's big.
- It's mine.

1849
01:12:24.689 --> 01:12:26.290
Gosh, he's so fast.

1850
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:33.160
(Baek Hyun gets a decent one.)

1851
01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:36.229
(Eun Woo gets
a flower-patterned umbrella.)

1852
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:39.870
(Everyone claims an umbrella.)

1853
01:12:40.399 --> 01:12:42.840
(Jin Young gets a blue umbrella.)

1854
01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:46.540
(Su Geun gets a red mini umbrella.)

1855
01:12:47.479 --> 01:12:48.740
My goodness.

1856
01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.149
This is a good one.

1857
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:52.080
Wait. I...

1858
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:54.319
How did people
wear these shoes in the past?

1859
01:12:54.319 --> 01:12:56.080
(Henry gets
the transparent umbrella.)

1860
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:58.620
- What's this?
- It's me.

1861
01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:01.090
What's this?

1862
01:13:01.219 --> 01:13:03.059
I ran well, but I couldn't catch it.

1863
01:13:03.059 --> 01:13:06.460
I should take off my hat.

1864
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:07.899
Ready.

1865
01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:09.359
Go, Team Su Geun!

1866
01:13:09.359 --> 01:13:10.769
- Let's go!
- Let's show them how good we are.

1867
01:13:10.769 --> 01:13:12.200
- Let's go!
- Go, Team Hyun Moo!

1868
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.139
- Let's go!
- Please start.

1869
01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:15.939
(Round 1 begins.)

1870
01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:22.780
(Team Su Geun attacks Bo Ah.)

1871
01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.179
(Team Hyun Moo tries to hide.)

1872
01:13:25.179 --> 01:13:26.950
(Team Su Geun gets ready
to move forward.)

1873
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:33.790
Cho Bo Ah flower has blossomed.

1874
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:36.259
(They start running as soon as
she starts singing.)

1875
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:40.460
(They run to hug
their team's player.)

1876
01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:44.469
Cho Bo Ah flower has blossomed.

1877
01:13:44.469 --> 01:13:46.670
(Team Su Geun attacks Bo Ah.)

1878
01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:48.939
We sound like
a troop of soldiers marching.

1879
01:13:48.939 --> 01:13:54.109
(Bo Ah should find a member
of Team Hyun Moo and eliminate him.)

1880
01:13:54.109 --> 01:13:57.210
(After 5 seconds,
she loses the chance.)

1881
01:13:58.179 --> 01:14:02.019
(It's Han Na's turn now.)

1882
01:14:02.519 --> 01:14:06.519
Kang Han Na flower...

1883
01:14:06.519 --> 01:14:08.719
(Team Hyun Moo aggressively
moves forward.)

1884
01:14:08.719 --> 01:14:09.790
has blossomed.

1885
01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.330
Kang Han Na flower has blossomed.

1886
01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:21.200
(Meanwhile, the leader of
Team Su Geun...)

1887
01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.139
(runs aggressively even if
it's the other team player's turn.)

1888
01:14:26.139 --> 01:14:30.550
(He's trying to position himself
for his team player's turn.)

1889
01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.780
(He falls.)

1890
01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.750
(His strategy was good,)

1891
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:39.790
(his brake didn't work.)

1892
01:14:40.719 --> 01:14:42.160
Kang Han Na flower has blossomed.

1893
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.429
The red panda umbrella...

1894
01:14:45.429 --> 01:14:46.729
is Su Geun.

1895
01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:48.700
(Su Geun gets eliminated.)

1896
01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.670
Do you want to see this?

1897
01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:51.899
I almost broke my toe.

1898
01:14:54.769 --> 01:14:56.200
(4 umbrellas remain for Team Su Geun
and 5 remain for Team Hyun Moo.)

1899
01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.809
I thought it was Bo Ah's turn.

1900
01:14:57.809 --> 01:14:59.469
It's very confusing. Pay attention.

1901
01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:02.040
I almost broke my toe.

1902
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.809
(Will she eliminate at least
one person from Team Hyun Moo?)

1903
01:15:04.809 --> 01:15:07.149
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

1904
01:15:07.849 --> 01:15:10.849
(Team Su Geun and
Team Hyun Moo charge forward.)

1905
01:15:10.849 --> 01:15:12.450
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

1906
01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:13.490
(I'll eliminate
at least one person.)

1907
01:15:13.859 --> 01:15:15.519
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

1908
01:15:15.519 --> 01:15:17.030
(Everyone runs.)

1909
01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:22.000
(They're only worried
about moving forward.)

1910
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.530
(They hastily lie on the floor.)

1911
01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:27.170
(What?)

1912
01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:29.469
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

1913
01:15:30.439 --> 01:15:33.139
(Are they Dumb and Dumber?)

1914
01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.439
The tiny yellow umbrella
is Hyun Moo.

1915
01:15:36.979 --> 01:15:38.550
(Hyun Moo gets eliminated.)

1916
01:15:39.609 --> 01:15:40.679
You are seriously terrible.

1917
01:15:40.679 --> 01:15:43.590
(Each team has 4 umbrellas.)

1918
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:44.689
My goodness.

1919
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:46.859
(Team Su Geun is at the front line.)

1920
01:15:48.059 --> 01:15:49.559
Here we go.

1921
01:15:49.559 --> 01:15:51.729
(Team Hyun Moo is in the far back.)

1922
01:15:51.729 --> 01:15:53.030
We have to be in the front.

1923
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:54.530
Kang Han Na flower
has blossomed.

1924
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:55.630
(Team Hyun Moo attacks Han Na.)

1925
01:15:55.630 --> 01:16:00.500
(But Team Su Geun
approaches her closely.)

1926
01:16:04.069 --> 01:16:07.109
(Team Hyun Moo is in trouble.)

1927
01:16:07.109 --> 01:16:10.210
The pink umbrella is Baek Hyun.

1928
01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:12.210
- No.
- No?

1929
01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:15.250
No. She's wrong.

1930
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.380
It's our turn.

1931
01:16:17.019 --> 01:16:18.790
(Now they just have to run
and hug their player.)

1932
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:20.490
Everyone is so near now.

1933
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.559
We're doing well.

1934
01:16:23.559 --> 01:16:24.660
(Baek Hyun and Daniel
are in the front.)

1935
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:27.759
(Team Su Geun is
just about to win.)

1936
01:16:27.759 --> 01:16:29.300
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

1937
01:16:29.359 --> 01:16:34.939
(Now they just have to hug
their player.)

1938
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:39.069
(Why are you approaching me?)

1939
01:16:41.139 --> 01:16:42.240
(They smile.)

1940
01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.679
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

1941
01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:47.050
(They are like a romantic couple.)

1942
01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:49.080
Good job, Baek Hyun.

1943
01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:52.920
(Isn't this too romantic?)

1944
01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.189
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

1945
01:16:56.189 --> 01:17:00.130
(Team Su Geun wins Round 1.)

1946
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.969
(Let's find
the Master Key together.)

1947
01:17:08.069 --> 01:17:10.670
- What happened?
- How do you wear this?

1948
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:11.840
(They only played 1 round,
but they're already worn off.)

1949
01:17:12.139 --> 01:17:13.679
It got stuck.

1950
01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.040
Don't take the yellow one.

1951
01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:17.880
That umbrella is the worst.

1952
01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:19.509
That's the worst.

1953
01:17:19.509 --> 01:17:21.979
- Ready.
- I am going to get the big one.

1954
01:17:21.979 --> 01:17:23.280
Start.

1955
01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.389
(Round 2 starts.)

1956
01:17:27.019 --> 01:17:28.090
It hurts.

1957
01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:29.120
(They run.)

1958
01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.189
My feet hurt.

1959
01:17:30.429 --> 01:17:31.429
(They start searching for
good umbrellas.)

1960
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:34.300
I'm here.

1961
01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.700
(The fast runners get
the big umbrella.)

1962
01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.729
I'm here.

1963
01:17:38.069 --> 01:17:39.670
Here's a good one.

1964
01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.670
Why would you go so far?

1965
01:17:42.899 --> 01:17:43.969
Come on.

1966
01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:45.710
- That one is better.
- Is that one better?

1967
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:47.340
(Seong Wu gets
the flower patterned umbrella.)

1968
01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.179
(Hyun Moo gets a big
umbrella this time.)

1969
01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:50.880
This one is really good.

1970
01:17:52.979 --> 01:17:55.019
Which is better? The red one?

1971
01:17:55.019 --> 01:17:57.120
- The red one is better.
- Is the red one better?

1972
01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.120
(They are the same.)

1973
01:17:59.849 --> 01:18:03.219
I can't run fast.

1974
01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:06.859
Baek Hyun, experience it.

1975
01:18:06.859 --> 01:18:08.259
Why do my toes keep getting stuck?

1976
01:18:08.259 --> 01:18:09.460
I feel so bad for him.

1977
01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:11.870
(Team Hyun Moo
and Team Su Geun)

1978
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:13.170
It looks cute.

1979
01:18:13.569 --> 01:18:15.000
- It looks cute.
- Let's go.

1980
01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:16.170
Let's go.

1981
01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:18.910
Can we take off the eye patch?

1982
01:18:18.969 --> 01:18:20.439
Hey! Jong Min!

1983
01:18:20.509 --> 01:18:22.639
- Jong Min.
- Move back.

1984
01:18:22.639 --> 01:18:24.210
Move back.

1985
01:18:24.309 --> 01:18:26.280
All right. Please start.

1986
01:18:26.609 --> 01:18:28.219
Just stay like this.

1987
01:18:28.219 --> 01:18:29.280
Just stay here.

1988
01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.990
Kang Han Na flower
has blossomed.

1989
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:34.590

has blossomed.

1991
01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.630
Is the red umbrella Daniel?

1992
01:18:44.769 --> 01:18:45.830
No.

1993
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:47.939
(It was Henry.)

1994
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.910
Don't move.

1995
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:52.309
Why would you push me?

1996
01:18:53.269 --> 01:18:57.080
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

1997
01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.580

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:02.750
has blossomed.

2000
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:03.950
(I hope you get busted!)

2001
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:06.859
(It was close.)

2002
01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.059
Has blossomed.

2003
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:13.290
(The umbrella moves back.)

2004
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.870
Hello.

2005
01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:20.639
Green leopard umbrella
is Jong Min.

2006
01:19:21.139 --> 01:19:23.840
(Su Geun makes Jong Min
get eliminated.)

2007
01:19:24.109 --> 01:19:25.109
It broke.

2008
01:19:25.109 --> 01:19:26.109
(This is how you play a game.)

2009
01:19:26.109 --> 01:19:27.179
Did it break?

2010
01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:29.809
(Sung Kwang approaches Bo Ah.)

2011
01:19:29.809 --> 01:19:31.550

Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

2014
01:19:38.819 --> 01:19:39.819
(Someone pulls Hyun Moo's
umbrella.)

2015
01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.960
(Hyun Moo is here.)

2016
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:50.429
Red checkered umbrella
is Hyun Moo.

2017
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:52.700
You said we should play fairly.

2018
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:54.340
You are a scary man.

2019
01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.399
(Winning is all that matters.)

2020
01:19:55.399 --> 01:19:59.109
(Team Hyun Moo is losing.)

2021
01:19:59.109 --> 01:20:00.109
I'm scared.

2022
01:20:01.509 --> 01:20:03.750
(Will Eun Woo from
Team Hyun Moo hug her?)

2023
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:07.380
(Or will Sung Kwang stop him?)

2024
01:20:08.849 --> 01:20:10.719

(Su Geun pulls Eun Woo.)

2027
01:20:16.059 --> 01:20:18.059
(Where do you think
you are going?)

2028
01:20:18.059 --> 01:20:20.130
(Su Geun stops Eun Woo.)

2029
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:22.059
This red umbrella is...

2030
01:20:22.059 --> 01:20:23.099
(Where are you going?)

2031
01:20:24.429 --> 01:20:25.530
(They are still struggling.)

2032
01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:26.630
Come on.

2033
01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:29.040
This red umbrella is...

2034
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.540
(Did Han Na...)

2035
01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:36.309
(find out about Sung Kwang?)

2036
01:20:36.309 --> 01:20:38.050
Daniel.

2037
01:20:38.649 --> 01:20:41.250
- No.
- How is that Daniel's body?

2038
01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:43.889
Ha Na is really bad at this.

2039
01:20:43.889 --> 01:20:44.950
Her time is up.

2040
01:20:45.349 --> 01:20:47.920
(Now Sung Kwang
just has to hug Bo Ah.)

2041
01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:48.960
You can't move.

2042
01:20:51.130 --> 01:20:52.929
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

2043
01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.929
(Finally, will I get a chance...)

2044
01:20:56.929 --> 01:21:01.099
(to become the hero?)

2045
01:21:01.639 --> 01:21:02.700
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

2046
01:21:02.899 --> 01:21:04.870
(I want to be as manly...)

2047
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:07.179
(as Baek Hyun.)

2048
01:21:07.179 --> 01:21:08.880
It's lovely.

2049
01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:10.809
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

2050
01:21:10.809 --> 01:21:13.250
(It's the moment
he's been dreaming about.)

2051
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:19.519
(It's time to make
his dream comes true.)

2052
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:21.389
Wait. Wait.

2053
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.960
(He wobbles.)

2054
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:25.960
- Isn't that a fail?
- What was that?

2055
01:21:26.359 --> 01:21:27.429
- Isn't that...
- No way.

2056
01:21:27.429 --> 01:21:28.899
- a fail?
- Wait.

2057
01:21:28.899 --> 01:21:30.599
- You should work out.
- Cho Bo Ah flower has...

2058
01:21:30.599 --> 01:21:31.800
Wait.

2059
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:35.240
- Hey. What does that make me?
- I am so sorry.

2060
01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:36.540
Pretend I am light.

2061
01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:37.569
Okay.

2062
01:21:38.069 --> 01:21:40.479
Cho Bo Ah flower
has blossomed.

2063
01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:41.509
(He lifted her up in his arms
with his persistence.)

2064
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:45.250
(Team Su Geun wins.)

2065
01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:47.580
Sung Kwang is the man
of persistence.

2066
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:48.849
His neck veins protruded.

2067
01:21:48.849 --> 01:21:49.979
(Sung Kwang is the best.)

2068
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:51.590
- We lost again.
- Did they win again?

2069
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:52.819
Did we lose again?

2070
01:21:52.819 --> 01:21:54.059
Whose fault is this?

2071
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.389
Someone must be
responsible for it.

2072
01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.429
Which ones have we done?

2073
01:22:00.429 --> 01:22:01.599
We got three.

2074
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.599
You can choose anything
except for those two.

2075
01:22:03.599 --> 01:22:04.729
Let's go with the certain one.

2076
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:06.630
Which one?

2077
01:22:07.469 --> 01:22:08.700
The fourth one is good too.

2078
01:22:09.069 --> 01:22:11.670
- Jin Young is leading it.
- It's revealing...

2079
01:22:11.939 --> 01:22:14.240
- one of our keys...
- We'll reveal one of our keys,

2080
01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.309
and we will check two of their keys.

2081
01:22:15.309 --> 01:22:16.910
- Didn't they do this?
- No, they didn't.

2082
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:19.309
- That would be very certain.
- Right? It'll end the game.

2083
01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:20.380
He's right.

2084
01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:21.420
- Right.
- Yes.

2085
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.450
We have already checked
four keys.

2086
01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:26.050
We just need to check
two more keys.

2087
01:22:26.050 --> 01:22:28.920
Which one's key should we reveal?

2088
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.130
- We should...
- You tell us.

2089
01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:32.990
We will reveal one of our keys,

2090
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:36.000
and we will check two of your keys.

2091
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.469
- This one?
- Yes.

2092
01:22:37.469 --> 01:22:39.700
- Eun Woo and Han Na.
- Eun Woo and Han Na.

2093
01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.700
- Are we the ones remaining?
- Yes, you're the ones remaining.

2094
01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.200
Please give us Han Na's key.

2095
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.910
- Let's reveal it together.
- Come here.

2096
01:22:45.009 --> 01:22:46.979
All right. Let's check it.

2097
01:22:46.979 --> 01:22:49.240
(Would the Master Key
be 1 of the 2 keys?)

2098
01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.250
- Come on.
- Let's start.

2099
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:52.780
Ready. Start.

2100
01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:55.849
- Is one of these the Master Key?
- Is one of these the Master Key?

2101
01:22:56.349 --> 01:22:58.389
We will reveal 1 of our keys
and check 2 of their keys.

2102
01:22:58.649 --> 01:22:59.819
That would be certain.

2103
01:22:59.819 --> 01:23:02.259
(They chose this to be certain
about the other team's keys.)

2104
01:23:02.319 --> 01:23:06.330
(Will Su Geun's strategy work?)

2105
01:23:07.759 --> 01:23:08.800
Su Geun.

2106
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.300
(Please)

2107
01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.639
Baek Hyun is awkward.
It's not the Master Key.

2108
01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.880
Baek Hyun. Goodness.

2109
01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.080
He looks very awkward.

2110
01:23:24.309 --> 01:23:26.280
Did I act like that a while ago?

2111
01:23:27.719 --> 01:23:28.719
(No way.)

2112
01:23:28.719 --> 01:23:30.090
Baek Hyun is awkward.
It's not the Master Key.

2113
01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:31.950
(Laughing)

2114
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:33.219
He looks very awkward.

2115
01:23:33.219 --> 01:23:34.490
(What was so funny?)

2116
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:35.819
- Did I act like that a while ago?
- He's unbelievable.

2117
01:23:35.819 --> 01:23:36.889
(What does his laughter mean?)

2118
01:23:36.889 --> 01:23:38.259
Did I act like this a while ago?

2119
01:23:38.259 --> 01:23:40.399
- Baek Hyun.
- Our team...

2120
01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:42.059
Good job.

2121
01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:43.059
Don't you usually act well?

2122
01:23:43.059 --> 01:23:44.670
- Jin Young.
- That was a good one.

2123
01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:46.599
Baek Hyun is so bad at acting.

2124
01:23:46.769 --> 01:23:48.099
I chose a wrong person.

2125
01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.469
We helped them a lot.

2126
01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.639
- It's our turn.
- Is it our turn?

2127
01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:53.740
Bring it here.

2128
01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.080
- Give it to us.
- Give it to us.

2129
01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.149
Bring the Master Key.

2130
01:23:58.149 --> 01:24:00.149
- That's it, isn't it?
- Daniel.

2131
01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:02.550
- That's it, isn't it?
- Please look at our faces.

2132
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:04.689
- It's you.
- Please look.

2133
01:24:04.689 --> 01:24:07.319
- This is it, isn't it?
- The meeting was for nothing.

2134
01:24:07.359 --> 01:24:08.990
- It's your chance.
- They discussed it for a long time.

2135
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:10.429
I won't say anything.

2136
01:24:13.859 --> 01:24:14.960
I'll put it in.

2137
01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.359
I'll put it in.

2138
01:24:16.359 --> 01:24:18.899
(It's the judgment time.)

2139
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:24.469
(This judgement will provide
them an important clue.)

2140
01:24:24.469 --> 01:24:27.479
- Is this key the Master Key?
- Is this key the Master Key?

2141
01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:30.050
- It's your last chance, Daniel.
- Henry is thick-faced.

2142
01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:31.509
This is really funny.

2143
01:24:35.979 --> 01:24:37.050
Really?

2144
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:39.090
They are so awkward.

2145
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:41.490
(Really?)

2146
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.219
Hey!

2147
01:24:43.219 --> 01:24:45.559
(What did Team Hyun Moo see?)

2148
01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:48.399
- It's x.
- It's x.

2149
01:24:48.399 --> 01:24:49.559
(We are curious
about Daniel's identity.)

2150
01:24:49.559 --> 01:24:51.300
It's x.

2151
01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.530
Han Na.

2152
01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.540
- I have no idea.
- Come here, everyone.

2153
01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:58.210
Baek Hyun, why don't you
use your chance card?

2154
01:24:58.210 --> 01:24:59.710
Yes. I will use it.

2155
01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:01.910
(Hyun decides to use
the secret chance card.)

2156
01:25:02.439 --> 01:25:04.950
(6 hours ago, the result
of the Watcher vote was revealed.)

2157
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:07.319
(Hyun ranked first
and obtained the Gold Chance Card.)

2158
01:25:07.349 --> 01:25:09.519
- Bo Ah.
- That's a big prize.

2159
01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:11.420
(What is
the Gold Chance Card for?)

2160
01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:13.090
(It allows him to check the key
of one player.)

2161
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:14.290
I chose one.

2162
01:25:15.259 --> 01:25:16.889
This will be a final blow.

2163
01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:22.300
We don't know
what Hyun's plan is.

2164
01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:25.729
(There's only one person
he wants to check.)

2165
01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:28.639
Is that key the Master Key?

2166
01:25:28.769 --> 01:25:30.340
(He asks the question.)

2167
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:36.179
(What will he find out?)

2168
01:25:36.179 --> 01:25:38.080
- He will be shocked.
- He's acting again.

2169
01:25:40.050 --> 01:25:42.349
(The result shows.)

2170
01:25:42.349 --> 01:25:43.450
He's acting.

2171
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:45.620
I got it.

2172
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:47.759
Wait.

2173
01:25:47.759 --> 01:25:49.620
It wasn't the Master Key.

2174
01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:51.859
- He knows everything now.
- He can be...

2175
01:25:51.859 --> 01:25:54.429
- the first winner.
- Baek Hyun will win.

2176
01:25:54.429 --> 01:25:56.429
(Who is hiding behind Henry
with the Master Key?)

2177
01:25:58.769 --> 01:26:00.840
(Among 12 keys,
there are 2 Master Keys.)

2178
01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.569
(Team Su Geun
won the first game.)

2179
01:26:02.569 --> 01:26:05.569
(Seong Wu, Jong Min,
and Hyun Moo got checked.)

2180
01:26:05.939 --> 01:26:08.109
(But none of them
had the Master Key.)

2181
01:26:08.939 --> 01:26:13.009
(Henry's key got checked.)

2182
01:26:13.009 --> 01:26:15.250
(Team Su Geun confirmed
that Henry has the Master Key.)

2183
01:26:15.819 --> 01:26:17.790
(After checking Henry's key,)

2184
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:21.460
(Team Su Geun checked
Eun Woo and Han Na's keys.)

2185
01:26:21.559 --> 01:26:24.130
(They reacted unusually.
What was the result?)

2186
01:26:24.130 --> 01:26:25.630
Baek Hyun, why don't you
use your chance card?

2187
01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:28.759
(Hyun uses the Gold Chance Card
to find the Master Key.)

2188
01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:30.569
You have the Master Key.

2189
01:26:30.569 --> 01:26:34.800
(Who has the other Master Key?)

2190
01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:36.399
Let's finish it.

2191
01:26:38.269 --> 01:26:40.679
This room has good energy.

2192
01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:43.009
- It was obvious.
- it was very obvious.

2193
01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.849
(Final judgement time)

2194
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:47.149
(They have to sum up all the hints
and find 2 Master Keys.)

2195
01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:49.620
Give me some hints.

2196
01:26:49.649 --> 01:26:52.090
- Henry wouldn't know.
- I think I know now.

2197
01:26:52.519 --> 01:26:53.790
I have no clue.

2198
01:26:54.189 --> 01:26:56.620
Am I the only one
not having a clue?

2199
01:26:56.889 --> 01:27:00.330
Finally, it's time...

2200
01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.399
to find out the winner.

2201
01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:06.170
Here's how you vote.
There's a ballot on the box.

2202
01:27:06.599 --> 01:27:09.139
Choose two people
with the Master Key.

2203
01:27:09.139 --> 01:27:10.809
You should write down their names.

2204
01:27:11.439 --> 01:27:13.340
Let's begin the voting.

2205
01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.210
I really have no clue.

2206
01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:16.609
I really have no clue.

2207
01:27:16.609 --> 01:27:17.910
Be objective.

2208
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:19.979
This is crazy.

2209
01:27:19.979 --> 01:27:22.149
(Henry has to protect
the other person to win.)

2210
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:26.519
(Who among them is
on the same boat as Henry?)

2211
01:27:27.389 --> 01:27:28.420
My goodness.

2212
01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:31.030
Key Man, please collect the ballots.

2213
01:27:31.630 --> 01:27:33.090
I don't know now.

2214
01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:36.200
Key Man, please collect the ballots.

2215
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:38.670
That's terrifying.

2216
01:27:39.399 --> 01:27:40.769
(Screaming)

2217
01:27:40.769 --> 01:27:41.870
(Bo Ah gets frightened.)

2218
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:42.899
My goodness.

2219
01:27:44.170 --> 01:27:47.139
- Bo Ah, he must be surprised.
- That surprised me.

2220
01:27:47.139 --> 01:27:49.979
I think you put on
too much sunscreen.

2221
01:27:50.009 --> 01:27:51.750
I think you put on
too much sunscreen.

2222
01:27:52.210 --> 01:27:53.550
He's wearing a facial mask.

2223
01:27:53.819 --> 01:27:55.380
My goodness. That was scary.

2224
01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:57.519
Now it's out of your hand.

2225
01:27:57.519 --> 01:28:00.420
First, I will reveal
the prize box...

2226
01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:02.620
the winner will be taking away.

2227
01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.160
- All right.
- It must emerge from there.

2228
01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:07.530
- Come on up.
- No way.

2229
01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:11.769
(What is the prize box?)

2230
01:28:11.769 --> 01:28:13.399
- No way.
- What's that?

2231
01:28:16.469 --> 01:28:17.910
(It waits for
the last person smiling.)

2232
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:19.939
What do you think is
inside the prize box?

2233
01:28:20.139 --> 01:28:21.280
I got scared to death.

2234
01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.380
What's inside?

2235
01:28:23.479 --> 01:28:25.349
What would be inside the box?

2236
01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.319
- Is the result out?
- All right now.

2237
01:28:28.050 --> 01:28:32.349
I will announce the two people
who got the most amount of votes.

2238
01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.319
Who is it? I have no clue.

2239
01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:36.519
Please reveal the result.

2240
01:28:37.290 --> 01:28:40.530
(The player who finds
the 2 Master Keys wins the prize.)

2241
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:42.929
- Is something going to explode?
- Something is going to explode.

2242
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:44.269
No.

2243
01:28:44.469 --> 01:28:45.670
- 1.
- 1.

2244
01:28:45.670 --> 01:28:47.439
(Who will be the 2 people
to go up the judgement podium?)

2245
01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:48.740
- 2.
- 2.

2246
01:28:51.009 --> 01:28:52.109
- 3.
- 3.

2247
01:28:52.670 --> 01:28:54.740
- This is scary.
- What's going on?

2248
01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.109
- This is scary.
- What's going on?

2249
01:28:58.509 --> 01:29:01.250
(Henry is arrested.)

2250
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.349
(Who is the other person
who got the most votes?)

2251
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:15.599
(The other person who got the most
suspicion is Cha Eun Woo.)

2252
01:29:16.359 --> 01:29:17.769
- Really?
- No way.

2253
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:20.800
- It's Cha Eun Woo.
- They got the most votes.

2254
01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.069
It must've been Eun Woo.

2255
01:29:22.069 --> 01:29:24.410
It was Eun Woo and Henry.

2256
01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:26.210
It was Eun Woo.

2257
01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:29.380
Let's see if you succeeded
to find the Master Key.

2258
01:29:29.479 --> 01:29:31.780
- Let's check it.
- It's going to open.

2259
01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:35.280
Henry and Eun Woo
got the most amount of votes.

2260
01:29:35.649 --> 01:29:36.790
Please go up the podium.

2261
01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:38.750
He got suspicious towards the end.

2262
01:29:39.349 --> 01:29:40.719
You are good at acting.

2263
01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:42.590
- You are a good actor.
- You look great.

2264
01:29:44.559 --> 01:29:48.460
Let's see if the box will open.

2265
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:51.099
- First...
- It'll be funny if it's not Henry.

2266
01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.170
Please put the key inside the hole.

2267
01:29:54.969 --> 01:29:56.939
Relax. You can just relax.

2268
01:29:57.170 --> 01:29:59.170
- He did it.
- Please put the key inside.

2269
01:29:59.309 --> 01:30:01.780
Is my key the Master Key?

2270
01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:03.080
(This is when he was
given the key.)

2271
01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.910
(His poker face confused everyone.)

2272
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:08.719
His face didn't change at all.

2273
01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.490
I will keep your secret.
You have the Master Key, don't you?

2274
01:30:11.519 --> 01:30:14.059
I don't think you have
the Master Key.

2275
01:30:14.059 --> 01:30:15.090
I don't have one either.

2276
01:30:16.729 --> 01:30:19.490
(Eun Woo claimed that he doesn't
have the Master Key.)

2277
01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:21.059
Please put the key in the hole.

2278
01:30:21.059 --> 01:30:22.259
(Is Eun Woo's claim true?)

2279
01:30:22.259 --> 01:30:23.330
One,

2280
01:30:24.269 --> 01:30:26.370
- 2, 3.
- Please.

2281
01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:28.500
Check the Master Key.

2282
01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:29.800
Please reveal the result.

2283
01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.910
(Who is the other one
with the Master Key?)

2284
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:38.809
(Is it Eun Woo?)

2285
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:43.990
(Henry is arrested.)

2286
01:30:49.689 --> 01:30:52.859
(Is Eun Woo the Master Key owner?)

2287
01:30:52.859 --> 01:30:54.530
Come on.

2288
01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.200
(It's open.)

2289
01:30:58.269 --> 01:31:02.069
(They succeeded to
find both Master Key owners.)

2290
01:31:02.370 --> 01:31:04.069
- Is it him?
- Is it him?

2291
01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.809
You got it.

2292
01:31:07.939 --> 01:31:09.139
(Is this real?)

2293
01:31:10.410 --> 01:31:11.509
Really?

2294
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:13.309
(Is Eun Woo really
the Master Key owner?)

2295
01:31:13.309 --> 01:31:16.219
(This is how he looked
when he first got the Master Key.)

2296
01:31:16.219 --> 01:31:17.450
- I knew it.
- It's Eun Woo.

2297
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:18.550
I knew it was you.

2298
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:20.389
Did you know it was me?

2299
01:31:20.389 --> 01:31:22.460
(We could've protected
each other.)

2300
01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:23.559
Wait.

2301
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:26.630
- Towards the end...
- This is crazy.

2302
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:28.800
- I got tricked by Eun Woo.
- What's important now is...

2303
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:32.870
- I thought you'd struggle...
- The key is hidden.

2304
01:31:32.969 --> 01:31:34.540
because it's the first episode.

2305
01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:36.170
- No way.
- But you've succeeded.

2306
01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:37.809
This is crazy.

2307
01:31:38.009 --> 01:31:39.040
- What is it?
- What is it?

2308
01:31:42.179 --> 01:31:43.979
- No way.
- it's gold.

2309
01:31:43.979 --> 01:31:45.280
Is it for us?

2310
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:47.250
Are we really getting these?

2311
01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:48.620
- Really?
- Wait.

2312
01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:51.349
Are these for those
who got the answers right?

2313
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:55.620
Who picked
Henry and Eun Woo...

2314
01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:58.160
to be the Master Key owners?
Team Su Geun!

2315
01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.160
(Who will claim the prize box?)

2316
01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.800
(Team Su Geun claims
the prize box.)

2317
01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.599
- Go, Team Su Geun!
- Go, Team Su Geun!

2318
01:32:04.969 --> 01:32:07.139
- Team Su Geun got the prize.
- Right.

2319
01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:09.899
I told you. Which team
you belong matters.

2320
01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:12.069
- The games are important.
- Watch what you say.

2321
01:32:12.069 --> 01:32:15.040
- Everyone got the prize.
- How did Henry...

2322
01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:19.880
(Team Su Geun won
Round 1 and checked 3 keys.)

2323
01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:22.649
(Is the Master Key here?)

2324
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:25.149
This is so fun.

2325
01:32:25.319 --> 01:32:27.420
- This is really fun.
- I love this.

2326
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:30.590
(After winning Round 2,
they targeted Henry.)

2327
01:32:31.259 --> 01:32:32.689
This is...

2328
01:32:32.729 --> 01:32:35.399
- He doesn't have it.
- Henry, take the Master Key.

2329
01:32:36.559 --> 01:32:40.870
(They revealed 1 of their keys and
checked the other teams' 2 keys.)

2330
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:44.269
(They checked Eun Wu
and Han Na's.)

2331
01:32:44.269 --> 01:32:47.979
(Is the Master Key here?)

2332
01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:49.740
(He's nervous.)

2333
01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:53.979
(Does Eun Woo or Han Na
have the other Master Key?)

2334
01:32:56.179 --> 01:32:58.149
- Baek Hyun.
- You're amazing.

2335
01:32:58.149 --> 01:33:00.519
(What is that reaction?)

2336
01:33:00.519 --> 01:33:02.090
I gave him courage.

2337
01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:03.660
You can't see it.

2338
01:33:04.059 --> 01:33:06.059
How is this possible?

2339
01:33:06.059 --> 01:33:09.800
(One of them had the Master Key.)

2340
01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.130
(Oh, my gosh.)

2341
01:33:13.130 --> 01:33:15.139
(Laughing)

2342
01:33:17.269 --> 01:33:20.380
(His strategy worked.)

2343
01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:25.109
(Either Eun Woo or Han Na had it.)

2344
01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:27.179
Baek Hyun, you should
use your chance card.

2345
01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:30.689
(Baek Hyun used his Gold Chance Card
to find the Master Key owner.)

2346
01:33:30.689 --> 01:33:33.559
(Their identity was
on the verge of getting revealed.)

2347
01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.120
I chose one.

2348
01:33:35.219 --> 01:33:38.059
(Who did he choose to uncover?)

2349
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:41.599
(Kang Han Na is selected.)

2350
01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:44.569
Is this key the Master Key?

2351
01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:52.910
(Does Han Na have
the other Master Key?)

2352
01:33:57.849 --> 01:33:59.050
I got it.

2353
01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.819
- Wait a minute.
- Goodness.
