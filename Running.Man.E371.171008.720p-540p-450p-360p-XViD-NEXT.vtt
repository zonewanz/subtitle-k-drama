(Do you remember I-Go Project?)

2
00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.965
(Those with 3 I Go Stickers must go on a penalty trip with a member.)

3
00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:15.135
(So Min's destination is Indonesia's Manual Wooden Cable Car.)

4
00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:17.837
(So Min's partner for the penalty is Kwang Soo.)

5
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:19.939
(Jakarta)

6
00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.545
(Kwang Soo and So Min left for Indonesia.)

8
00:00:30.317 --> 00:00:34.187

(The tiger moth siblings' fierce survival in Indonesia)

10
00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:45.565
(Who will earn more mission money and become the winner?)

11
00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:50.937
(Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game)

12
00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:54.641
(Find the one who is speaking the truth.)

13
00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:59.112
(The professional liars searched for the truth.)

14
00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:03.149
(The unchosen one and the fooled members received penalty badges.)

15
00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.753
(The toll of penalty badges)

16
00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:10.557
(They accumulated penalty badges through Round 1 and 2.)

17
00:01:11.257 --> 00:01:15.061
(Jae Seok and Se Chan had to go on a slingshot ride.)

18
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.198
(They were forced to enjoy the sky from a height.)

19
00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:21.701
(The toll of penalty badges)

20
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:23.336
(Finally,)

21
00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:25.772
(the tiger moth siblings arrive at their destination.)

22
00:01:26.272 --> 00:01:30.777
(They must ride a wooden cable car and fight against the waves.)

23
00:01:30.777 --> 00:01:33.947
(Did they safely carry out the penalty?)

24
00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:37.417
(Today comes a legendary penalty that is even scarier.)

25
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.753
(The 2 members with the most number of penalty badges...)

26
00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:42.188
(will receive a live penalty for Chuseok.)

27
00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:46.226
(Who will be the 2 members?)

28
00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:49.629
Everyone, Round Two is over.

29
00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:52.999
Let's move to the next location for Round 3 and 4 of Truth Game.

30
00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:54.000
Okay.

31
00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:56.569
Let's go.

32
00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.505
- For goodness' sake. - This ride has cameras.

33
00:01:58.505 --> 00:01:59.672
What is this?

34
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.777
(A ride blocks them on their way to Round 3.)

35
00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:05.412
What is this?

36
00:02:05.712 --> 00:02:07.046
Will we get dropped from a height again?

37
00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:08.815
From where will we drop?

38
00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:10.383
It looks like we will get dropped from a height again.

39
00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:13.987
It's called Big Swing.

40
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:16.623
(At the height of 40m,)

41
00:02:16.623 --> 00:02:19.225
(the riders charge forward as they make a semicircle.)

42
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.232
(It's a VIP ride that lets you feel the nature with your entire body.)

43
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.468
- My goodness. - I can't go on it.

44
00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:30.270
- I am getting motion sickness. - Nevis Swing.

45
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.438
Nevis Swing.

46
00:02:31.438 --> 00:02:32.772
(The others worry about Big Swing, but he goes on about Nevis Swing.)

47
00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:38.311
(Haha and Se Chan must go to Nevis Swing due to visa issues.)

48
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:41.414
(Nevis Swing in New Zealand is the scariest swing in the world.)

49
00:02:41.414 --> 00:02:42.782
(Why do we need to go?)

50
00:02:42.782 --> 00:02:44.717
(Am I going on...)

51
00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:46.853
(Nevis Swing?)

52
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.690
(Nevis Swing occupied Haha's mind throughout the shoot.)

53
00:02:51.758 --> 00:02:55.862
Please help me.

54
00:02:55.862 --> 00:02:58.331
I really don't think I can do it.

55
00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.167
Please give me another way.

56
00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:03.236
I can go on anything but that.

57
00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:05.371
Don't do that to the scriptwriter.

58
00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:08.374
It's you, right? You are the one who is riding Nevis Swing with me.

59
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.109
It's you, right?

60
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.511
What are you doing here?

61
00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:13.279
Hurry up, and return to your position.

62
00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:15.982
My goodness.

63
00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:17.951
We are ruined.

64
00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:22.222
We will reveal the penalty of Round Three first.

65
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:24.724
- The penalty of Round Three is... - There is a penalty.

66
00:03:24.858 --> 00:03:29.295
an extreme ride that lets you fly like a moth from the height of 36m.

67
00:03:29.662 --> 00:03:33.266
It's really scary.

68
00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:34.634
Please focus.

69
00:03:35.034 --> 00:03:36.503
I'll be really focused.

70
00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:38.605
Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game Round 3.

71
00:03:38.872 --> 00:03:40.640
- Play video. - I can't do it.

72
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.975
(Will they win or be penalized?)

73
00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:45.378
(Tiger Moth Tour Question 3)

74
00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:46.813
(Kwang Soo and So Min head to Pantai Timang.)

75
00:03:46.813 --> 00:03:48.281
I still can't believe it.

76
00:03:48.648 --> 00:03:50.116
- That we're in Indonesia? - Yes.

77
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.620
(Depressed)

78
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.689
Let's stay in a good mood by laughing.

79
00:03:57.223 --> 00:03:58.224
We can laugh like this.

80
00:03:58.224 --> 00:03:59.225
(Let's enjoy it.)

81
00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:00.527
I'll try to enjoy it.

82
00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:03.196
- How... - It was really pretty.

83
00:04:03.663 --> 00:04:05.932
The color of the sea was beautiful when I saw it yesterday.

84
00:04:05.932 --> 00:04:08.034
(The cable car that So Min saw on video)

85
00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:10.970
(It's a bright emerald color.)

86
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.475
(In the middle of the vast sea...)

87
00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:17.310
(is a relaxing ride.)

88
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.749
(Cable car at Pantai Timang where you can relax and enjoy)

89
00:04:23.683 --> 00:04:24.684
It'll be beautiful.

90
00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:26.753
(It may turn out better than expected.)

91
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.124
(With hopes in their hearts, they travel for 3.5 hours.)

92
00:04:31.124 --> 00:04:32.125
It's cloudy.

93
00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:33.626
It might rain.

94
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:36.629
- I think... - Are we here?

95
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.934
We have to take a four-wheel jeep from here.

96
00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:42.235
- Do we have to travel more? - Do we transfer?

97
00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:44.370
- Yes. - We aren't here yet?

98
00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:48.308
The road is too dangerous to travel in this car.

99
00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:50.043
Where are we going?

100
00:04:50.677 --> 00:04:52.245
Is this "The Law of Jungle"?

101
00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.347
How far are we going?

102
00:04:55.315 --> 00:04:56.983
I thought we arrived.

103
00:04:57.417 --> 00:04:59.552
Please transfer to the jeep.

104
00:04:59.552 --> 00:05:00.553
(It's another penalty.)

105
00:05:00.553 --> 00:05:04.057
(You're watching Tiger Moth Penalty Tour.)

106
00:05:04.057 --> 00:05:05.358
They continue traveling.

107
00:05:05.558 --> 00:05:06.926
We went farther.

108
00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:07.927
Much farther.

109
00:05:07.927 --> 00:05:09.729
(One hour left until the cable car)

110
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:13.366
(What's going on?)

111
00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:14.934
- It's endless. - On the way...

112
00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:17.804
to be penalized isn't easy.

113
00:05:17.804 --> 00:05:19.105
The trip itself is a penalty.

114
00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:20.974
- It's so cute. - Which do we ride?

115
00:05:20.974 --> 00:05:22.609
It's this one.

116
00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:25.178
- It's really cute. - Are we supposed to take a jeep?

117
00:05:25.244 --> 00:05:26.879
Does it wobble a lot?

118
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.881
It seems like a honeymoon.

119
00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:30.249
They're wearing matching outfits.

120
00:05:31.117 --> 00:05:32.752
- It was by accident. - It was.

121
00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:34.053
They look good together.

122
00:05:35.355 --> 00:05:36.856
You're too tall to fit.

123
00:05:39.292 --> 00:05:40.293
It's cool.

124
00:05:41.227 --> 00:05:42.629
The jeep is so small.

125
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.430
(They'll arrive at the destination soon.)

126
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:47.934
(He doesn't forget to wave to his fans.)

127
00:05:49.302 --> 00:05:52.538
(It's exciting to ride the jeep.)

128
00:05:54.807 --> 00:05:56.442
It feels like we're traveling.

129
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:00.413
It doesn't wobble as much as I expected.

130
00:06:01.114 --> 00:06:04.484
(After traveling for 5 minutes,)

131
00:06:04.484 --> 00:06:07.120
(they enter an unpaved road.)

132
00:06:07.987 --> 00:06:10.289
- Goodness. - I feel nauseous.

133
00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:13.626
(Shaking)

134
00:06:13.626 --> 00:06:15.228
All my insides are shaking.

135
00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.564
This is only the start.

136
00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:20.166
I was excited for nothing.

137
00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:24.103
(It's definitely not a pleasant trip.)

138
00:06:24.103 --> 00:06:25.104
Is this necessary?

139
00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:27.874
That must be nauseating.

140
00:06:27.874 --> 00:06:29.609
It was terrible.

141
00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:31.878
We came in farther.

142
00:06:31.878 --> 00:06:33.112
It's a long trip.

143
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.983
I keep thinking whether I did something terribly wrong...

144
00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:39.118
since yesterday.

145
00:06:39.118 --> 00:06:40.753
(He blames Unlucky Ones' Race.)

146
00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:43.556
I hope this suffering will end.

147
00:06:43.556 --> 00:06:46.192
- I know. - It's painful.

148
00:06:46.426 --> 00:06:48.928
It feels like overdue homework. Let's finish it.

149
00:06:49.062 --> 00:06:50.363
We travel much farther.

150
00:06:50.363 --> 00:06:51.497
Much farther.

151
00:06:51.631 --> 00:06:53.366
It's a rough trip.

152
00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:54.367
(How far must they go?)

153
00:06:55.802 --> 00:06:57.437
(The trip is endless and rough.)

154
00:06:57.437 --> 00:07:00.940
(They're on their way to finish their overdue homework.)

155
00:07:02.608 --> 00:07:05.878
Let's pretend to look happy from the back.

156
00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:07.914
They're filming us behind.

157
00:07:09.048 --> 00:07:12.251
(It's a wonderful trip.)

158
00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:15.488
(She's with the Prince of Asia.)

159
00:07:15.488 --> 00:07:17.223
Are you pretending to be excited?

160
00:07:17.223 --> 00:07:18.424
(The smell of wood from the cable car)

161
00:07:19.192 --> 00:07:23.229
(Cable car and Pantai Timang, here we come.)

162
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.631
(They look happy from the back.)

163
00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:27.233
Doesn't it smell like the sea?

164
00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:29.602
- I start to smell it. - It smells like the sea.

165
00:07:31.003 --> 00:07:32.305
- This is great. - I smell the sea.

166
00:07:32.305 --> 00:07:33.372
What's this?

167
00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:36.175
(What do they see?)

168
00:07:36.175 --> 00:07:38.745
- We're here for a penalty. - I know.

169
00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:41.547
- What's going on? - It was crowded with his fans.

170
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:43.382
Really?

171
00:07:43.382 --> 00:07:44.383
Were your fans there?

172
00:07:44.484 --> 00:07:46.986
They came all the way here.

173
00:07:47.253 --> 00:07:49.055
(You're awesome, Kwang Soo.)

174
00:07:50.923 --> 00:07:54.427
(Prince of Asia appears.)

175
00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:57.430
(Not only do the fans welcome Kwang Soo,)

176
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.167
(but they also welcome the other Running Man members.)

177
00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:03.736
I knew it, Kwang Soo.

178
00:08:05.238 --> 00:08:07.240
Will Kwang Soo make another disgusting face?

179
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.374
(No way,)

180
00:08:08.374 --> 00:08:09.375
What did you say?

181
00:08:09.609 --> 00:08:11.110
- I don't want to see it. - What?

182
00:08:11.244 --> 00:08:13.312
There it is.

183
00:08:13.312 --> 00:08:15.615
- He starts again. - There's the look.

184
00:08:15.882 --> 00:08:18.751
(He shows his charming smile.)

185
00:08:19.485 --> 00:08:22.789
(Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo.)

186
00:08:23.356 --> 00:08:24.791
They even liked his hairstyle.

187
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:26.626
I don't understand why.

188
00:08:26.626 --> 00:08:28.227
He seems so happy.

189
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:30.062
He can't stop smiling.

190
00:08:30.196 --> 00:08:33.232
He doesn't stop waving his hand.

191
00:08:33.499 --> 00:08:34.500
Let me see.

192
00:08:35.568 --> 00:08:39.372
You don't forget to wave your hand.

193
00:08:39.372 --> 00:08:41.374
You keep waving.

194
00:08:42.241 --> 00:08:44.977
(They arrive at the final destination.)

195
00:08:45.912 --> 00:08:47.079
I'm exhausted.

196
00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:48.648
Welcome to Pantai Timang.

197
00:08:48.648 --> 00:08:50.650
(The cable car is right in the front.)

198
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.984
Look at that.

199
00:08:51.984 --> 00:08:54.587
- It looks unreal. - We might break a camera.

200
00:08:57.857 --> 00:08:58.958
(It's a steep cliff.)

201
00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.359
Is that it?

202
00:09:00.526 --> 00:09:02.261
It looks amazing when that happens.

203
00:09:02.261 --> 00:09:03.529
Are the waves that big?

204
00:09:03.529 --> 00:09:05.231
Yes, they're huge.

205
00:09:05.364 --> 00:09:06.365
Is that it?

206
00:09:06.666 --> 00:09:09.101
It looks quite different from the photos.

207
00:09:09.101 --> 00:09:10.136
(It looks very different.)

208
00:09:11.103 --> 00:09:17.109
(It's a thrilling ride over the emerald ocean.)

209
00:09:17.877 --> 00:09:19.946
- The video was unrealistic. - I can do that.

210
00:09:19.946 --> 00:09:21.380
- I can't ride the Nevis Swing. - I can.

211
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.949
It's much different in reality.

212
00:09:23.749 --> 00:09:26.085
- Is it really scary? - Look at that.

213
00:09:26.853 --> 00:09:29.255
(Welcome to Pantai Timang.)

214
00:09:30.223 --> 00:09:32.225
(Will we be safe?)

215
00:09:32.725 --> 00:09:35.628
Do you see what the locals prepared for you?

216
00:09:37.363 --> 00:09:38.364
"Running Man".

217
00:09:38.865 --> 00:09:40.233
They hung it for us.

218
00:09:40.233 --> 00:09:41.634
(The locals made a welcome sign.)

219
00:09:41.634 --> 00:09:43.269
- Really? - They made a sign.

220
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:45.004
- That's nice of them. - It's so cool.

221
00:09:45.004 --> 00:09:47.473
- It's such a big welcome. - I know.

222
00:09:47.573 --> 00:09:50.743
- We should be happy... - I'm grateful.

223
00:09:50.743 --> 00:09:52.111
and try to enjoy it.

224
00:09:53.246 --> 00:09:54.881
We can enjoy it, right?

225
00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:56.015
Please do.

226
00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:57.483
Let's go.

227
00:09:57.483 --> 00:09:58.851
(Thank you, everyone.)

228
00:09:58.885 --> 00:10:00.119
The waves are very strong.

229
00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:01.621
(As soon as he tries to enjoy himself...)

230
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:03.256
I've never seem them so big.

231
00:10:04.023 --> 00:10:05.024
They're unreal.

232
00:10:05.024 --> 00:10:06.726
(They seem modified by a computer.)

233
00:10:06.726 --> 00:10:07.727
Seriously.

234
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.396
- What's that bridge for? - That must be a bridge.

235
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.365
Do we cross the bridge?

236
00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:13.366
No way.

237
00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:15.234
This is the way.

238
00:10:15.868 --> 00:10:19.105
You're at the penalty site after a long trip.

239
00:10:19.105 --> 00:10:21.240
Yes, we are. This is the site of the accident.

240
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.241
(Do you see what's behind us?)

241
00:10:23.276 --> 00:10:26.145
- In "Haeundae"... - We'll be on SBS News.

242
00:10:26.145 --> 00:10:27.213
(It's not a movie.)

243
00:10:27.213 --> 00:10:28.214
I've seen it before.

244
00:10:28.214 --> 00:10:32.385
- Recommended by Syifa Amalina... - What?

245
00:10:32.518 --> 00:10:33.719
- What did you say? - Say it again.

246
00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:36.355
- The destination was recommended... - That's right.

247
00:10:36.355 --> 00:10:37.623
by Syifa Amalina.

248
00:10:37.623 --> 00:10:40.126
- Made with clotheslines and wood, - Clothesline?

249
00:10:40.126 --> 00:10:42.128
it's a 100m Manual Wooden Cable Car.

250
00:10:42.161 --> 00:10:43.229
Are these clotheslines?

251
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:44.830
Yes.

252
00:10:45.097 --> 00:10:46.832
- They're real clotheslines? - Yes.

253
00:10:46.832 --> 00:10:48.134
- Where we hang laundry? - Yes.

254
00:10:49.869 --> 00:10:53.239
It's often used by fishermen to catch crayfish...

255
00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:56.108
that lives near that small island.

256
00:10:56.475 --> 00:10:59.578
It's not a tourist spot. It's used for transport.

257
00:10:59.745 --> 00:11:01.480
It's to catch crayfish.

258
00:11:02.114 --> 00:11:05.885
A net is laid out a day before to catch crayfish.

259
00:11:05.885 --> 00:11:08.120
- It sounds delicious. - With the help of the village head,

260
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.822
we laid out a net.

261
00:11:09.989 --> 00:11:13.626
Bring the crayfish in the net from the island.

262
00:11:13.626 --> 00:11:16.729
What? I'm not a fisherman.

263
00:11:16.729 --> 00:11:18.497
That's a professional task.

264
00:11:18.497 --> 00:11:20.199
Bring the crayfish in the net.

265
00:11:20.266 --> 00:11:23.502
As it's a wooden cable car, there's a weight limit.

266
00:11:23.502 --> 00:11:25.738
You'll ride it separately.

267
00:11:25.738 --> 00:11:27.340
Decide who will go first.

268
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.641
They can't go together?

269
00:11:28.874 --> 00:11:30.509
Decide who will go first.

270
00:11:30.643 --> 00:11:31.777
So Min will go first.

271
00:11:32.478 --> 00:11:34.380
(Good luck, Kwang Soo.)

272
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.881
So Min?

273
00:11:36.482 --> 00:11:37.483
No.

274
00:11:37.984 --> 00:11:38.985
An ant bit me.

275
00:11:39.986 --> 00:11:41.620
Look, I'm hurt.

276
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.456
An ant bit me.

277
00:11:43.456 --> 00:11:45.725
- I have an ant bite. - I got injured here.

278
00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:47.226
- An ant bite. - I got hurt.

279
00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:48.361
It's a fire ant.

280
00:11:49.628 --> 00:11:52.264
You should go first. I want to see how it is beforehand.

281
00:11:53.132 --> 00:11:56.068
Gosh, look at that.

282
00:11:56.068 --> 00:11:58.270
(The waves suddenly crash.)

283
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.639
The waves came all the way here.

284
00:12:00.973 --> 00:12:02.975
Do you want to choose by Plus and Minus?

285
00:12:03.576 --> 00:12:04.577
Shall we spin the roulette?

286
00:12:05.378 --> 00:12:06.479
I pick plus.

287
00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:08.147
You pick minus.

288
00:12:08.948 --> 00:12:10.649
(He's in a turmoil.)

289
00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:11.650
Pick one.

290
00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:12.752
I pick plus.

291
00:12:12.752 --> 00:12:13.886
(If So Min picks plus...)

292
00:12:13.886 --> 00:12:15.087
Do you pick minus?

293
00:12:15.621 --> 00:12:16.655
Yes.

294
00:12:16.655 --> 00:12:17.723
(Kwang picks minus.)

295
00:12:17.723 --> 00:12:18.724
Here we go.

296
00:12:20.726 --> 00:12:22.361
(Will it be So Min...)

297
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:25.197
(or Kwang Soo who goes first?)

298
00:12:25.197 --> 00:12:28.234
(Unsurprisingly, it's Kwang Soo.)

299
00:12:29.835 --> 00:12:31.003
(It's only natural.)

300
00:12:31.003 --> 00:12:34.240
Kwang Soo will go first.

301
00:12:34.473 --> 00:12:36.108
You know I wanted to go first, right?

302
00:12:36.108 --> 00:12:37.376
- No. - Just remember that.

303
00:12:37.376 --> 00:12:38.377
No way.

304
00:12:38.878 --> 00:12:40.479
Even if it were a plus, I'd have gone first.

305
00:12:40.479 --> 00:12:42.748
The waves have calmed down.

306
00:12:42.882 --> 00:12:45.084
You should go now. The time is now.

307
00:12:45.084 --> 00:12:46.085
(The waves calmed down?)

308
00:12:47.353 --> 00:12:49.121
(That's not calm.)

309
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:50.956
- Gosh. - Look at the waves.

310
00:12:50.956 --> 00:12:52.124
They look scary.

311
00:12:52.124 --> 00:12:54.727
(Is the time now?)

312
00:12:55.761 --> 00:12:58.998
(Kwang Soo mentally prepares himself.)

313
00:12:58.998 --> 00:13:05.104
- We don't have much to carry... - My goodness.

314
00:13:05.104 --> 00:13:06.205
(Screaming)

315
00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:07.973
(Shrieking)

316
00:13:08.774 --> 00:13:10.109
Goodness.

317
00:13:10.743 --> 00:13:11.744
I can't do it.

318
00:13:12.745 --> 00:13:14.480
- I can't do it. - I won't do it.

319
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.582
Gosh, they're in trouble.

320
00:13:16.582 --> 00:13:17.583
(She's shocked by the waves.)

321
00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:20.086
- That's frightening. - That's impossible.

322
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.156
(As Kwang Soo gets ready to go,)

323
00:13:24.156 --> 00:13:27.960
(the waves frighten him at the perfect time.)

324
00:13:28.094 --> 00:13:29.328
I won't do it.

325
00:13:29.628 --> 00:13:31.464
- I won't do it. - I give up.

326
00:13:31.464 --> 00:13:32.465
(He gives up.)

327
00:13:33.265 --> 00:13:36.635
(The locals are used to the waves.)

328
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:41.474
(The waves are crashing down heavily.)

329
00:13:41.474 --> 00:13:45.478
(Will he be able to go through the penalty today?)

330
00:13:47.046 --> 00:13:48.981
Okay. All right.

331
00:13:48.981 --> 00:13:50.116
(I can do this.)

332
00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:51.884
- Look at the waves. - Everyone rides this.

333
00:13:53.486 --> 00:13:55.354
- I bet you must've hated riding it. - From here...

334
00:13:55.354 --> 00:13:57.056
(He says he can ride it, but he keeps going to the back.)

335
00:13:57.056 --> 00:13:58.657
I can just sit there. That's all.

336
00:13:59.725 --> 00:14:01.760
This is the same as spraying water on me when I'm sitting on a chair.

337
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.995
(This is just a common penalty.)

338
00:14:04.363 --> 00:14:05.397
Let's go.

339
00:14:05.731 --> 00:14:07.199
You can swim. You learned how to swim.

340
00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.001
(He tells himself that he's a swimming prodigy.)

341
00:14:10.703 --> 00:14:12.238
There's no way I'd fall into the sea.

342
00:14:12.238 --> 00:14:13.906
(He's about to face the penalty after hesitating for 30 minutes.)

343
00:14:14.874 --> 00:14:16.108
Kwang Soo, good luck!

344
00:14:16.108 --> 00:14:17.276
(She sincerely roots for him.)

345
00:14:19.011 --> 00:14:22.481
(It's time to end the long-lasting homework of the I-Go Project.)

346
00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:25.384
- Should I go this way? - You want me to put this away?

347
00:14:25.384 --> 00:14:26.485
Yes, just for a moment, please.

348
00:14:28.254 --> 00:14:30.456
Please help me with this.

349
00:14:30.456 --> 00:14:34.360
(Kwang Soo, the 1st one to face the penalty, gets on the cable car.)

350
00:14:35.828 --> 00:14:36.996
Should I do this after lunch?

351
00:14:36.996 --> 00:14:39.231
(Is it safe for me to ride this on an empty stomach?)

352
00:14:39.231 --> 00:14:41.867
(No, I should get this over with quickly, right?)

353
00:14:46.005 --> 00:14:49.608
(Tired of waiting, the spirit of variety shows slaps his cheeks.)

354
00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:52.344
I don't think I can do this! I can't do this!

355
00:14:53.746 --> 00:14:54.980
I lost!

356
00:14:56.115 --> 00:14:57.883
I don't think I can ride this cable car!

357
00:14:58.517 --> 00:14:59.952
What a timing.

358
00:14:59.952 --> 00:15:02.021
- This doesn't seem possible. - It looks like a skit, doesn't it?

359
00:15:03.322 --> 00:15:06.926
(Oh, poor Kwang Soo. What an unfortunate timing!)

360
00:15:10.496 --> 00:15:11.597
Did you see Kwang Soo?

361
00:15:12.031 --> 00:15:14.266
(Giggling)

362
00:15:15.234 --> 00:15:18.003
I want to go back to Korea!

363
00:15:20.105 --> 00:15:22.374
(Mom...)

364
00:15:22.908 --> 00:15:23.976
All right. Let's do this.

365
00:15:24.276 --> 00:15:26.212
Let's go. I should get this over with.

366
00:15:26.345 --> 00:15:27.613
Please move up a bit.

367
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:31.383
- Put this up. - Gosh, this is shaking.

368
00:15:31.383 --> 00:15:32.651
- You can just put this up. - This is shaking.

369
00:15:33.018 --> 00:15:34.220
(At the news of Kwang Soo's appearance,)

370
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.256
(the color of the waves begins to darken.)

371
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.860
(So many of my fans are watching me now.)

372
00:15:42.494 --> 00:15:44.330
(He goes inside the cable car after 40 minutes.)

373
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.764
Go forward. Wait, no.

374
00:15:46.498 --> 00:15:51.604
(He puts on the safety gear to prepare just in case.)

375
00:15:53.005 --> 00:15:54.073
It fits perfectly.

376
00:15:54.073 --> 00:15:55.274
This is...

377
00:15:55.608 --> 00:15:57.109
Now that I'm sitting here...

378
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.111
I can't...

379
00:15:59.111 --> 00:16:00.246
(What should I do?)

380
00:16:00.246 --> 00:16:01.981
I can't do this now that I'm sitting here.

381
00:16:02.114 --> 00:16:03.249
What's your name?

382
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.985
- I'm Murphy. Yes. - Murphy?

383
00:16:06.785 --> 00:16:07.853
How old are you?

384
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.456
I'm 25 years old.

385
00:16:11.223 --> 00:16:12.658
Tell him that I'm older than he is.

386
00:16:13.726 --> 00:16:14.860
(He feels proud of his age.)

387
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.995
- He's older? - Yes.

388
00:16:15.995 --> 00:16:17.296
- I see. - I'm older than you.

389
00:16:17.296 --> 00:16:19.999
(I'm counting on you, Murphy. Don't forget I'm older than you.)

390
00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:21.200
Be careful.

391
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.268
He told you to be careful.

392
00:16:22.768 --> 00:16:25.604
Be careful? How can I be careful here?

393
00:16:26.005 --> 00:16:27.206
How?

394
00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:28.641
(I can't do anything here!)

395
00:16:29.975 --> 00:16:34.113
(Murphy explains something to Kwang Soo.)

396
00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:35.281
I speak Korean.

397
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.486
- I'm Korean. - It was calm for three days.

398
00:16:40.486 --> 00:16:44.056
But today, the waves are big today. So you should grab the handle...

399
00:16:44.056 --> 00:16:45.491
tightly because it might be dangerous.

400
00:16:48.894 --> 00:16:51.096
It was calm for three days, but the waves got big just today?

401
00:16:51.096 --> 00:16:53.232
No, that's not how it happened.

402
00:16:53.232 --> 00:16:55.134
Kwang Soo made the sea angry.

403
00:16:55.134 --> 00:16:57.870
Hold on. What did I do to upset the sea?

404
00:16:58.871 --> 00:17:02.241
(But the sea does look like it's upset.)

405
00:17:02.908 --> 00:17:05.878
(Screaming)

406
00:17:08.314 --> 00:17:11.283
(He's completely soaked. This guy has upset Poseidon.)

407
00:17:11.283 --> 00:17:14.553
Please. Please spare me!

408
00:17:15.421 --> 00:17:19.358
(His misfortunes even upset the sea that had been calm.)

409
00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:21.360
After Kwang Soo rode the cable car, the waves are crashing even harder.

410
00:17:21.694 --> 00:17:22.861
So it's been confirmed.

411
00:17:23.629 --> 00:17:25.564
He has the energy that upsets everyone.

412
00:17:25.564 --> 00:17:26.865
The sea is very angry now.

413
00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.867
Were you having fun?

414
00:17:29.268 --> 00:17:30.369
(Feeling guilty)

415
00:17:30.369 --> 00:17:33.272
- So Min, you had to ride that next. - Right.

416
00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:36.075
- Right now, I can't laugh. - That looks so scary.

417
00:17:36.075 --> 00:17:37.876
- That must be so terrifying. - Goodness, that cable car...

418
00:17:37.876 --> 00:17:39.645
The waves were so big to the point that it was so weird.

419
00:17:40.245 --> 00:17:42.715
Please. Please stop this!

420
00:17:43.515 --> 00:17:44.817
Please stop the waves.

421
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.320
(But it can no longer be delayed as the waves are getting stronger.)

422
00:17:50.189 --> 00:17:52.391
(I can do this.)

423
00:17:54.259 --> 00:17:57.196
(The 1st one to face the penalty of I-Go Project)

424
00:17:57.196 --> 00:17:59.631
(Kwang Soo sets out at last.)

425
00:18:01.266 --> 00:18:02.368
Go!

426
00:18:03.635 --> 00:18:04.603
(It stops.)

427
00:18:04.603 --> 00:18:05.871
- What's going on? - Oh, dear!

428
00:18:06.138 --> 00:18:07.339
- It's going. - He's going.

429
00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:08.774
- What's going on? - Hey.

430
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:10.776
- Be careful! - What is it?

431
00:18:10.776 --> 00:18:12.311
(Because of the cameras, it can't speed up.)

432
00:18:12.311 --> 00:18:13.379
What's wrong?

433
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.915
It's shaking. The string got stretched because he's heavy.

434
00:18:17.349 --> 00:18:18.450
The string is stretched out.

435
00:18:20.018 --> 00:18:22.221
(When he's about to have a moment of peace,)

436
00:18:22.221 --> 00:18:24.656
(the fierce waves visit him.)

437
00:18:24.656 --> 00:18:28.594
(For Kwang Soo, the locals are speeding the process.)

438
00:18:30.696 --> 00:18:32.865
(However, as he penetrates through the strong waves,)

439
00:18:32.865 --> 00:18:35.300
(he begins to advance little by little.)

440
00:18:35.367 --> 00:18:37.069
I'm sorry.

441
00:18:38.303 --> 00:18:41.306
(He keeps on mumbling.)

442
00:18:43.575 --> 00:18:44.710
What's happening to me now?

443
00:18:46.078 --> 00:18:47.446
This is where I am after I regained my senses.

444
00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.782
(Why am I here?)

445
00:18:49.782 --> 00:18:50.949
I'm doomed.

446
00:18:52.184 --> 00:18:54.019
My life is in ruins.

447
00:18:57.156 --> 00:18:58.957
I should've removed Ji Hyo's name tag.

448
00:18:58.957 --> 00:19:00.526
I should've done it at all cost.

449
00:19:00.526 --> 00:19:01.760
(During the last race of I-Go Project,)

450
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.964
(things would have been different had I removed hers.)

451
00:19:06.365 --> 00:19:07.633
I should've caught the king crabs.

452
00:19:07.633 --> 00:19:09.134
- I should've done that in Russia. - Did you catch them?

453
00:19:09.134 --> 00:19:10.636
(No, if only I caught the king crabs 5 months ago...)

454
00:19:11.203 --> 00:19:15.340
(If only the king crabs were hanging at the end of my fishing line...)

455
00:19:16.442 --> 00:19:19.845
(If only a king crab bit my bait by any chance...)

456
00:19:22.147 --> 00:19:24.016
Where did I go wrong?

457
00:19:25.184 --> 00:19:26.718
(Sighing in despair)

458
00:19:26.718 --> 00:19:28.821
It must be after that time. No, it's not.

459
00:19:29.888 --> 00:19:30.956
It started even before then.

460
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.359
(He begins to regret his past misfortunes as the waves flood in.)

461
00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:36.628
I'm almost there. I'm almost there.

462
00:19:36.628 --> 00:19:39.765
What a beautiful view. The scenery is dazzling.

463
00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:42.668
This is pretty. How beautiful.

464
00:19:42.968 --> 00:19:44.470
(The view is amazing.)

465
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.871
This is straight from a painting.

466
00:19:54.246 --> 00:19:57.349
(At that time, the painting comes alive.)

467
00:19:57.349 --> 00:19:58.884
Hold on!

468
00:19:59.651 --> 00:20:01.186
(Gosh, that looks horrifying.)

469
00:20:01.186 --> 00:20:02.321
This is... Oh, no.

470
00:20:02.321 --> 00:20:05.023
Everyone was so surprised. They all screamed.

471
00:20:05.023 --> 00:20:07.159
Kwang Soo disappeared for a second.

472
00:20:08.794 --> 00:20:10.896
(He comes to his senses.)

473
00:20:11.163 --> 00:20:12.764
Hold on!

474
00:20:19.137 --> 00:20:20.806
(A helicopter camera was filming him.)

475
00:20:21.306 --> 00:20:22.574
Oh, no! The helicopter camera!

476
00:20:22.574 --> 00:20:24.109
Did you see the drone camera that just fell?

477
00:20:24.109 --> 00:20:25.511
(The drone crashed down.)

478
00:20:25.511 --> 00:20:26.745
- That's a helicopter camera. - It fell!

479
00:20:26.745 --> 00:20:27.779
Oh, no!

480
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.148
- All the cameras turned off. - What's going on?

481
00:20:30.148 --> 00:20:31.583
- Really? - The waves were just too big.

482
00:20:31.583 --> 00:20:32.951
- It's all my fault! - Goodness.

483
00:20:32.951 --> 00:20:34.086
It's just...

484
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.423
(While Kwang Soo is facing the waves that crashed the drone...)

485
00:20:42.327 --> 00:20:43.495
It's all my fault.

486
00:20:44.863 --> 00:20:45.931
It's dangerous.

487
00:20:49.835 --> 00:20:51.303
I should put on suncream.

488
00:20:51.303 --> 00:20:52.604
(She doesn't show much interest.)

489
00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:55.574
Where is my bag? Would you like something to drink?

490
00:20:56.074 --> 00:20:57.342
Do you want a drink?

491
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.646
- No? I'm rich. I have 100 dollars. - On which car did you leave it?

492
00:21:05.517 --> 00:21:06.718
(Someone is shaking this cable car!)

493
00:21:06.718 --> 00:21:07.953
Please!

494
00:21:09.154 --> 00:21:11.356
Pull me back! Pull!

495
00:21:11.623 --> 00:21:14.159
Hey, pull me back there! Come on!

496
00:21:14.259 --> 00:21:18.030
It's coming again. Don't do it! Stop!

497
00:21:18.397 --> 00:21:19.831
(Screaming in agony)

498
00:21:20.165 --> 00:21:22.401
(He swears at Poseidon.)

499
00:21:24.036 --> 00:21:27.706
(While Kwang Soo is doing this unforgettable activity...)

500
00:21:27.906 --> 00:21:29.107
Where is she?

501
00:21:29.107 --> 00:21:31.410
(So Min's "Backpack Travels")

502
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.844
Would you like to try this?

503
00:21:33.445 --> 00:21:34.580
What is this?

504
00:21:35.414 --> 00:21:36.615
(Longan is a tropical fruit from dry seasons.)

505
00:21:36.615 --> 00:21:38.584
She told me to press it in the center.

506
00:21:43.589 --> 00:21:45.357
This has a hint of garlic smell.

507
00:21:45.357 --> 00:21:46.758
But the aftertaste is quite fruity, isn't it?

508
00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:50.696
(Thus, she continued experiencing the culture.)

509
00:21:50.929 --> 00:21:52.097
You weren't watching him?

510
00:21:52.097 --> 00:21:54.766
When I turned back, that's how she looked. She crossed her legs.

511
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.070
(I'm sorry. I got scared watching you.)

512
00:21:59.571 --> 00:22:02.307
I shouldn't have been chosen by the roulettes!

513
00:22:05.644 --> 00:22:08.614
(Gosh, I can't believe I went through those waves.)

514
00:22:10.115 --> 00:22:13.418
(Kwang Soo is soaked in waves, sweat, and tears.)

515
00:22:14.386 --> 00:22:17.022
(Kwang Soo has reached the island on the other side.)

516
00:22:17.823 --> 00:22:19.124
(Who am I?)

517
00:22:19.124 --> 00:22:21.526
(Where am I?)

518
00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:25.097
(At last, I feel much better. I am done with my penalty!)

519
00:22:25.097 --> 00:22:26.164
(Kwang Soo, the 1st one to face the penalty,)

520
00:22:26.164 --> 00:22:29.301
(reaches the island on the other side.)

521
00:22:30.435 --> 00:22:32.871
(So Min, you're up next.)

522
00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:35.374
I'm getting all nervous.

523
00:22:35.374 --> 00:22:36.408
(Gosh, you did well.)

524
00:22:36.808 --> 00:22:38.276
- But why do people... - The waves are crazy.

525
00:22:39.144 --> 00:22:40.445
cross to the other side?

526
00:22:40.445 --> 00:22:42.714
(Why do people cross to the other side?)

527
00:22:42.714 --> 00:22:43.715
To catch shrimps.

528
00:22:43.715 --> 00:22:45.050
- He told us that. - He already said that earlier.

529
00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.885
He already told us that. Why are you talking about that again?

530
00:22:47.386 --> 00:22:50.188
(You're so frustrating. Please listen to others.)

531
00:22:51.189 --> 00:22:52.691
- For the locals there... - When?

532
00:22:52.691 --> 00:22:54.159
Why are you keeping this a secret from me?

533
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.195
(Seok Jin is hilarious.)

534
00:22:57.195 --> 00:22:58.930
But that's better than Nevis Swing.

535
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.666
(You're laughing now, Haha?)

536
00:23:01.266 --> 00:23:03.635
- Jae Seok, please stop it. - I'm serious.

537
00:23:03.635 --> 00:23:05.437
If you keep this up, he might stop filming.

538
00:23:05.671 --> 00:23:08.173
- This is better in every aspect. - This is way better than that.

539
00:23:08.173 --> 00:23:09.408
(Compared to Nevis Swing, this is easy.)

540
00:23:10.308 --> 00:23:12.344
All right, So Min. You'll get on the cable car now.

541
00:23:12.844 --> 00:23:14.346
I ate too many fruits.

542
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.348
I think I should go to the bathroom.

543
00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:18.550
Let me pray before I go.

544
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.052
(Please help me make a safe return.)

545
00:23:22.587 --> 00:23:23.689
Hello.

546
00:23:23.689 --> 00:23:24.856
(The 3rd question of Truth Game)

547
00:23:24.856 --> 00:23:26.124
Thank you for your help.

548
00:23:27.426 --> 00:23:30.629
(So Min finally gets on the cable car after a long wait.)

549
00:23:31.096 --> 00:23:33.131
This is so high. This is higher than I expected.

550
00:23:33.131 --> 00:23:34.966
(Seeing it up close makes her feel dizzy.)

551
00:23:36.201 --> 00:23:38.203
What should I do?

552
00:23:38.203 --> 00:23:39.337
(How did Kwang Soo ride this?)

553
00:23:40.038 --> 00:23:42.140
(Question number 3)

554
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.310
(What did So Min hand Kwang Soo as soon as she finished the ride?)

555
00:23:46.078 --> 00:23:47.312
- What? - What is it?

556
00:23:47.312 --> 00:23:48.380
(It's the third question.)

557
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.216
(It's the 3rd question to determine who will take the penalty.)

558
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:55.120
(What did So Min hand Kwang Soo as soon as she finished the ride?)

559
00:23:55.353 --> 00:23:57.122
All right, you two. Please come out...

560
00:23:57.522 --> 00:23:58.757
and pick Truth or Lie.

561
00:23:58.857 --> 00:24:00.058
What did she give?

562
00:24:00.058 --> 00:24:02.627
(Only one of the two will tell them the truth.)

563
00:24:02.627 --> 00:24:04.830
(The others must pick who's telling the truth to avoid the penalty.)

564
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.164
I really don't know.

565
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:08.800
I can't trust them anymore.

566
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.168
Who will speak first?

567
00:24:10.168 --> 00:24:11.870
Can we listen to Kwang Soo first?

568
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.338
All right. I'll speak.

569
00:24:14.206 --> 00:24:16.341
I picked Truth this time for certain.

570
00:24:17.008 --> 00:24:18.777
- Is that right? - So Min handed me...

571
00:24:19.411 --> 00:24:21.146
the fruit which she was eating a while ago.

572
00:24:21.146 --> 00:24:23.949
(Kwang Soo claims that So Min gave him the fruit.)

573
00:24:25.383 --> 00:24:28.220
(After riding that dangerous cable car,)

574
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.855
(So Min handed him the fruit?)

575
00:24:29.855 --> 00:24:31.656
What nonsense is he talking about now?

576
00:24:31.857 --> 00:24:34.326
- That's not funny at all. - What's wrong with you?

577
00:24:34.793 --> 00:24:36.862
- This is the truth. - It's not funny.

578
00:24:36.862 --> 00:24:37.896
I'm telling you the truth.

579
00:24:38.396 --> 00:24:40.031
I only said two sentences just now.

580
00:24:40.031 --> 00:24:42.300
Why on earth would she give you the fruit?

581
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.835
I'm telling you the truth.

582
00:24:43.835 --> 00:24:45.370
- It was the fruit for certain. - Kwang Soo.

583
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.139
I trust you. I know you're telling the truth.

584
00:24:47.272 --> 00:24:49.274
- Listen to me. - This isn't it.

585
00:24:50.108 --> 00:24:51.376
- He's lying for certain. - Hey.

586
00:24:51.376 --> 00:24:52.611
- Because... - Goodness.

587
00:24:52.611 --> 00:24:53.879
Jong Kook isn't getting things right today.

588
00:24:53.879 --> 00:24:56.615
As soon as I heard the question, I thought it was the fruit.

589
00:24:56.615 --> 00:24:58.450
- I thought it was the fruit too. - Listen to me.

590
00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.552
There were fruits...

591
00:25:00.685 --> 00:25:02.687
beside the entrance of the cable car.

592
00:25:02.687 --> 00:25:04.589
What kind of fruit was it?

593
00:25:04.656 --> 00:25:06.625
I had never seen that kind before.

594
00:25:06.625 --> 00:25:07.759
- It was... - Was it dried or not?

595
00:25:07.759 --> 00:25:09.895
- They were hanging on a tree. - He doesn't know...

596
00:25:09.895 --> 00:25:11.696
- It was sweet and sour. - because he didn't have it.

597
00:25:11.696 --> 00:25:13.365
(He had never seen it before, but it tasted sweet and sour.)

598
00:25:13.365 --> 00:25:19.371
- I forgot its name. - All fruits are sweet and sour.

599
00:25:20.105 --> 00:25:21.206
Are you kidding me?

600
00:25:21.206 --> 00:25:23.375
- It was yellow. - I know what it was.

601
00:25:23.375 --> 00:25:25.177
- What was it? - I know what that was.

602
00:25:25.177 --> 00:25:27.546
It was yellow,

603
00:25:27.546 --> 00:25:29.114
and it tasted like grapes.

604
00:25:29.114 --> 00:25:32.818
- One of them was like snake skin. - Right, right.

605
00:25:32.884 --> 00:25:34.886
- What do you mean? - Say its color at the same time.

606
00:25:34.886 --> 00:25:36.321
Tell us the color at the same time.

607
00:25:36.588 --> 00:25:40.525
It's a fact that So Min had the fruit.

608
00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:42.661
So why would she give you the fruit?

609
00:25:42.661 --> 00:25:44.429
- It had a huge seed inside. - Listen to me.

610
00:25:45.363 --> 00:25:47.098
- Why would I... - It's the fruit.

611
00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:49.267
- give him the fruit? - What did you give him then?

612
00:25:49.267 --> 00:25:51.069
- You tell me then. - She wouldn't give him that.

613
00:25:51.069 --> 00:25:52.103
- Tell us. - What did you give him?

614
00:25:52.103 --> 00:25:53.338
Think of an idea quickly.

615
00:25:53.338 --> 00:25:56.341
I swore at you.

616
00:25:56.341 --> 00:25:59.811
(So Min claims that she gave him swear words.)

617
00:25:59.878 --> 00:26:02.380
- You gave him swear words? - That wouldn't be aired then.

618
00:26:03.648 --> 00:26:05.116
He shouted at me from the other side...

619
00:26:05.283 --> 00:26:08.053
because he became upset...

620
00:26:08.053 --> 00:26:10.822
that I enjoyed eating the fruit and watched him get the penalty.

621
00:26:10.822 --> 00:26:12.891
He yelled at me from the other side.

622
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:15.160
So as soon as I got off, he went,

623
00:26:15.427 --> 00:26:17.128
"You brat, you're dead meat."

624
00:26:17.128 --> 00:26:18.363
What's that?

625
00:26:18.363 --> 00:26:19.397
(Kwang Soo swore at So Min?)

626
00:26:20.832 --> 00:26:22.200
(What is she talking about?)

627
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.835
It's all right if she lies, but...

628
00:26:23.835 --> 00:26:25.403
Hold on.

629
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.572
Hold on. When did I...

630
00:26:28.673 --> 00:26:30.842
- I didn't say that. - Goodness.

631
00:26:30.842 --> 00:26:33.278
- Did I say that to you? - You're impossible.

632
00:26:33.378 --> 00:26:34.646
- Did I? - Is this real?

633
00:26:34.646 --> 00:26:36.715
- Is this real? - No, listen to me.

634
00:26:36.715 --> 00:26:38.283
Does it make sense?

635
00:26:38.283 --> 00:26:42.053
You helpless punk!

636
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.555
- How could you... - Gosh.

637
00:26:44.522 --> 00:26:45.891
I'm sorry,

638
00:26:46.024 --> 00:26:47.659
but why is Seok Jin upset?

639
00:26:48.927 --> 00:26:50.262
I got upset too late.

640
00:26:50.528 --> 00:26:53.064
I thought about it for some time, and it made me mad.

641
00:26:53.064 --> 00:26:54.266
That was so sudden.

642
00:26:54.266 --> 00:26:55.634
I became righteous all of a sudden.

643
00:26:56.601 --> 00:26:58.603
I'm sure about this.

644
00:26:58.603 --> 00:27:00.805
It's what Kwang Soo usually behaves.

645
00:27:00.805 --> 00:27:03.208
So what did you give him?

646
00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:05.110
- So what did you give him? - You'll find out soon.

647
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.645
So I gave him...

648
00:27:06.645 --> 00:27:07.679
- You gave him the finger? - Yes.

649
00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:08.880
You'll know if you hear me.

650
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.615
That's what she'd do.

651
00:27:10.615 --> 00:27:11.650
(It sounds about right.)

652
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.351
She often does that.

653
00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:16.588
- You're right. - She often does that.

654
00:27:16.821 --> 00:27:18.156
I'm getting goosebumps.

655
00:27:18.156 --> 00:27:20.125
- My goodness. - A while ago,

656
00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:22.661
- Haha guessed... - I didn't believe it at first.

657
00:27:22.661 --> 00:27:23.895
the same thing.

658
00:27:23.895 --> 00:27:26.898
- Because it's plausible. - He guessed this.

659
00:27:28.566 --> 00:27:31.436
(Right after the question was given)

660
00:27:32.103 --> 00:27:33.104
By any chance,

661
00:27:33.872 --> 00:27:34.873
is it what I think it is?

662
00:27:35.807 --> 00:27:36.875
Is it?

663
00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:41.846
(Haha guessed if So Min gave him the bad finger.)

664
00:27:44.215 --> 00:27:46.384
- Goodness. - She was...

665
00:27:46.685 --> 00:27:48.119
She was too frightened...

666
00:27:48.119 --> 00:27:50.255
- to give me such a thing. - Guys.

667
00:27:50.255 --> 00:27:51.623
Listen to me.

668
00:27:51.623 --> 00:27:55.393
You tend to comfort each other when you face some kind of trouble...

669
00:27:55.393 --> 00:27:57.629
even though you're filming a variety show.

670
00:27:57.629 --> 00:27:58.897
That's what I'm talking about.

671
00:27:58.897 --> 00:28:01.566
I'm aware So Min is such a playful girl,

672
00:28:01.566 --> 00:28:03.568
but she must've given him the fruit in that situation.

673
00:28:03.568 --> 00:28:05.437
Hold on. I'm suspicious of one thing.

674
00:28:05.537 --> 00:28:09.841
How did you know So Min was eating the fruit?

675
00:28:09.908 --> 00:28:11.276
I watched it on TV.

676
00:28:11.276 --> 00:28:12.877
(He was receiving the penalty, so how did he know?)

677
00:28:12.877 --> 00:28:14.512
- Don't you think so? - You're right.

678
00:28:14.612 --> 00:28:16.915
- I kept telling you this. - He's being suspicious.

679
00:28:16.948 --> 00:28:19.884
How did you know what she was doing behind you?

680
00:28:19.884 --> 00:28:21.186
- His eyesight is that good? - At that time,

681
00:28:21.186 --> 00:28:23.655
I didn't know she was eating fruit.

682
00:28:23.655 --> 00:28:24.923
- He couldn't see. - I only saw her...

683
00:28:24.923 --> 00:28:27.425
- take selfies at that time. - He saw her take selfies.

684
00:28:27.425 --> 00:28:29.027
- Right. - I saw that.

685
00:28:29.094 --> 00:28:32.063
Because where I was wasn't that far from the other side.

686
00:28:32.063 --> 00:28:35.066
Jae Seok must really not want to get penalized.

687
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.435
He's thinking so hard.

688
00:28:37.635 --> 00:28:39.537
- He's never been... - He's being extra careful.

689
00:28:39.604 --> 00:28:41.106
It was an important moment.

690
00:28:41.106 --> 00:28:42.173
(If they can't guess this, they'll get closer to the penalty.)

691
00:28:42.173 --> 00:28:44.409
It was the moment when she just finished her ride.

692
00:28:44.476 --> 00:28:46.011
There's no way I swore at her at that moment.

693
00:28:46.011 --> 00:28:48.346
You must be aware of how Kwang Soo usually behaves.

694
00:28:48.847 --> 00:28:50.048
- You must all know. - Right.

695
00:28:50.048 --> 00:28:52.150
- I had no strength either. - Think about it.

696
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:56.154
Do you think I crawled to her and swore at her?

697
00:28:56.654 --> 00:28:58.356
I had no strength to even walk.

698
00:28:58.390 --> 00:28:59.624
But I swore at her?

699
00:28:59.624 --> 00:29:00.725
- Trust me. - I can't...

700
00:29:00.725 --> 00:29:02.961
trust either of them to be honest.

701
00:29:03.395 --> 00:29:04.529
That's true.

702
00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:06.131
Hold on, guys. You have to ride that one this time.

703
00:29:06.131 --> 00:29:07.532
- Keep that in mind. - Guys, look behind you.

704
00:29:07.532 --> 00:29:08.933
(So Min gave Kwang Soo the fruit or swear words?)

705
00:29:08.933 --> 00:29:11.102
(Who's telling the truth?)

706
00:29:11.102 --> 00:29:12.404
It's an extreme ride...

707
00:29:12.404 --> 00:29:15.306
that you fly from 36m above the ground to the lake.

708
00:29:15.306 --> 00:29:17.008
(Those who pick the wrong side will experience the big swing.)

709
00:29:17.008 --> 00:29:22.714
(Who will get to fly across the sky like a moth that jumps into flames?)

710
00:29:23.114 --> 00:29:25.517
- One. - Trust me this once.

711
00:29:25.517 --> 00:29:27.185
We're in the same situation again.

712
00:29:27.185 --> 00:29:28.353
(1 of the 2 will be exempted.)

713
00:29:28.353 --> 00:29:29.521
You'll never get married in your life if you're lying.

714
00:29:29.654 --> 00:29:30.755
- Are you still sure? - Yes.

715
00:29:30.755 --> 00:29:31.956
(Whom will the members choose?)

716
00:29:31.956 --> 00:29:33.291
All right. One.

717
00:29:33.324 --> 00:29:35.160
(Whom will the members choose?)

718
00:29:35.193 --> 00:29:36.194
Two.

719
00:29:36.194 --> 00:29:38.630
(Is it Kwang Soo or So Min?)

720
00:29:40.765 --> 00:29:42.600
- Three. - It's so hard to decide.

721
00:29:43.101 --> 00:29:44.269
(They're torn.)

722
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:45.370
I don't know.

723
00:29:46.137 --> 00:29:47.539
(Turning)

724
00:29:48.106 --> 00:29:49.541
(Only two chose So Min.)

725
00:29:50.208 --> 00:29:52.377
- I really don't know. - They didn't give us enough time.

726
00:29:52.377 --> 00:29:53.378
(Ji Hyo decides to trust So Min.)

727
00:29:53.378 --> 00:29:55.380
(It's 4 to 2.)

728
00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.614
Why?

729
00:29:57.115 --> 00:29:58.883
Why don't you trust me?

730
00:29:58.883 --> 00:30:01.920
I suspected Kwang Soo at first.

731
00:30:02.187 --> 00:30:04.022
But he's persuasive.

732
00:30:04.022 --> 00:30:06.191
He wouldn't have sworn at her when he just finished his penalty.

733
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:07.292
- Right? - He wouldn't have done that.

734
00:30:07.292 --> 00:30:10.195
Only Ji Hyo and Se Chan chose to trust So Min.

735
00:30:10.195 --> 00:30:11.663
- What? - Ji Hyo chose So Min?

736
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.132
Ji Hyo chose to trust me.

737
00:30:14.132 --> 00:30:15.633
- I chose So Min. - Give us a final chance.

738
00:30:15.633 --> 00:30:17.936
- Look at you. - Don't be swayed.

739
00:30:17.936 --> 00:30:19.671
- Step away. - I'm telling you the truth.

740
00:30:19.671 --> 00:30:20.839
- See? - Ji Hyo...

741
00:30:20.839 --> 00:30:22.040
Don't be swayed.

742
00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.042
- Why did she choose So Min? - I'm right.

743
00:30:24.042 --> 00:30:26.344
Anyway, it's decided that So Min will get the penalty.

744
00:30:26.544 --> 00:30:29.781
- I don't know. - Let's check the answer now.

745
00:30:29.781 --> 00:30:33.718
(What's the truth behind this question?)

746
00:30:35.353 --> 00:30:36.654
Hello.

747
00:30:37.455 --> 00:30:38.690
Thank you in advance.

748
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.291
(So Min gets ready for the ride.)

749
00:30:42.127 --> 00:30:44.629
(Frightened)

750
00:30:44.762 --> 00:30:46.264
Wait a second.

751
00:30:46.431 --> 00:30:48.600
This is much higher than expected.

752
00:30:49.601 --> 00:30:52.837
Wait a second. This is much higher than expected.

753
00:30:53.638 --> 00:30:57.575
(Kwang Soo must've felt this way a while ago.)

754
00:30:57.575 --> 00:30:59.410
What should I do?

755
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.081
So Min!

756
00:31:05.283 --> 00:31:06.851
So Min, you must come back.

757
00:31:06.851 --> 00:31:08.620
(Focus!)

758
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.655
We must return home.

759
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:17.128
What is that on his head? Is it a jellyfish or what?

760
00:31:17.362 --> 00:31:18.530
- It's my hair. - Is that seaweed?

761
00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.365
- It's my real hair. - Oh, I see.

762
00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:23.067
You must come back.

763
00:31:23.067 --> 00:31:24.669
(His seaweed hairstyle captures attention.)

764
00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:26.104
You can return home.

765
00:31:26.104 --> 00:31:27.105
(It turns the Prince of Asia into a beggar.)

766
00:31:27.105 --> 00:31:28.306
Let's go, So Min!

767
00:31:29.274 --> 00:31:32.143
This is much scarier than I thought it'd be.

768
00:31:32.143 --> 00:31:34.012
Gosh, this seems so fragile.

769
00:31:36.614 --> 00:31:41.419
(It's difficult to even fit her body into the tiny space.)

770
00:31:41.419 --> 00:31:42.654
It might break.

771
00:31:43.388 --> 00:31:44.622
Gosh, it's frightening.

772
00:31:44.622 --> 00:31:46.524
(Will she successfully finish the ride?)

773
00:31:47.425 --> 00:31:48.960
What if a wave hits me?

774
00:31:49.861 --> 00:31:51.296
What should I do then?

775
00:31:54.365 --> 00:31:58.636
(Welcome. It's your first time at Pantai Timang, isn't it?)

776
00:31:58.937 --> 00:32:01.873
(She didn't realize it then.)

777
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.474
Be careful!

778
00:32:05.043 --> 00:32:07.345
(I love Indonesia.)

779
00:32:07.812 --> 00:32:10.415
(She had no idea then...)

780
00:32:10.415 --> 00:32:15.286
(just how nice it was to relax and wait for Kwang Soo.)

781
00:32:15.286 --> 00:32:18.823
(Now, she's sitting in the cable car.)

782
00:32:18.823 --> 00:32:19.857
Okay.

783
00:32:20.091 --> 00:32:23.094
Goodness, I don't think I can do this.

784
00:32:24.195 --> 00:32:25.296
Goodness.

785
00:32:25.296 --> 00:32:30.268
(She's about to enter the world of waves.)

786
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:33.905
(Nervous)

787
00:32:33.905 --> 00:32:35.873
Be careful.

788
00:32:36.407 --> 00:32:38.409
(She can't take it back anymore.)

789
00:32:38.409 --> 00:32:41.913
What should I do? My goodness.

790
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.916
Hold on. Oh, no.

791
00:32:45.116 --> 00:32:46.884
- Please. - That looks so scary.

792
00:32:47.118 --> 00:32:50.088
- That's scary. - I'll never be able to do that.

793
00:32:50.088 --> 00:32:52.123
Hold on. Oh, no.

794
00:32:52.123 --> 00:32:53.625
Hold on.

795
00:32:54.325 --> 00:32:57.295
Gosh, the waves.

796
00:32:58.096 --> 00:32:59.330
Please don't come near me.

797
00:32:59.664 --> 00:33:03.301
Please don't. Not the waves.

798
00:33:03.568 --> 00:33:04.936
Please.

799
00:33:06.704 --> 00:33:09.641
(Will she get to avoid facing the waves as she wishes?)

800
00:33:09.641 --> 00:33:11.009
Oh, no.

801
00:33:11.843 --> 00:33:14.045
(It doesn't seem that bad.)

802
00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.515
(It doesn't seem as bad this time.)

803
00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:19.317
Here come the waves.

804
00:33:19.884 --> 00:33:21.119
Gosh, the waves.

805
00:33:21.953 --> 00:33:23.554
Oh, dear.

806
00:33:23.554 --> 00:33:25.523
(What's going on?)

807
00:33:25.857 --> 00:33:27.058
Let's go.

808
00:33:27.759 --> 00:33:31.562
(Pantai Timang never disappoints you.)

809
00:33:31.562 --> 00:33:36.401
(It's a gift only for So Min.)

810
00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:39.304
(The waves are here again.)

811
00:33:39.304 --> 00:33:40.905
After those waves?

812
00:33:40.905 --> 00:33:42.940
She can't have sworn after those waves.

813
00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.009
It was scary when it wobbled.

814
00:33:45.009 --> 00:33:46.311
Those waves were huge.

815
00:33:46.311 --> 00:33:47.745
They're so strong.

816
00:33:48.646 --> 00:33:49.914
(Waves)

817
00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:57.255
(Scary waves hit the cable car.)

818
00:33:58.856 --> 00:34:00.625
(Screaming)

819
00:34:00.625 --> 00:34:01.626
Gosh!

820
00:34:04.696 --> 00:34:05.697
Gosh!

821
00:34:05.763 --> 00:34:08.800
(Engulfed)

822
00:34:10.535 --> 00:34:14.739
(What is this?)

823
00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:16.074
I hate this.

824
00:34:16.074 --> 00:34:20.678
(Wasn't she taking selfies and eating fruits until a moment ago?)

825
00:34:22.213 --> 00:34:23.281
I hate this.

826
00:34:23.281 --> 00:34:24.449
(Am I being punished for being too happy?)

827
00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:25.817
Seriously.

828
00:34:26.584 --> 00:34:28.219
I hate this so much.

829
00:34:29.387 --> 00:34:32.256
(After a few big waves, So Min finally gets to the other side.)

830
00:34:32.256 --> 00:34:35.660
(She's smiling again.)

831
00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.428
(She's smiling now.)

832
00:34:37.428 --> 00:34:38.429
Gosh.

833
00:34:41.366 --> 00:34:42.800
Did you see how the car wobbled?

834
00:34:43.868 --> 00:34:46.237
- Do you know how it was for me? - Did you see it?

835
00:34:46.738 --> 00:34:48.740
- Are you okay? - Yes.

836
00:34:49.741 --> 00:34:52.510
Excuse me. Sorry.

837
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:53.945
(So Min and Kwang Soo's cable car rides are finished.)

838
00:34:53.945 --> 00:34:56.280
We have to go back, right?

839
00:34:56.547 --> 00:34:57.548
Yes.

840
00:34:57.548 --> 00:34:59.050
(So Min is about to give something to Kwang Soo.)

841
00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:01.085
- Kwang Soo. - It wasn't that bad.

842
00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:02.954
(What is she going to give him?)

843
00:35:02.954 --> 00:35:04.489
Kwang Soo might have said something to make her swear.

844
00:35:04.489 --> 00:35:06.023
That's possible.

845
00:35:06.023 --> 00:35:08.092
- Kwang Soo... - This is an important moment.

846
00:35:08.092 --> 00:35:09.093
(What is she going to give him?)

847
00:35:10.595 --> 00:35:12.363
- Kwang Soo. - It wasn't that bad.

848
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:13.798
(She takes something out.)

849
00:35:14.065 --> 00:35:15.066
It wasn't that bad.

850
00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:20.405
(If So Min swears to Kwang Soo, So Min is the truthful one.)

851
00:35:20.405 --> 00:35:24.842
(If she gives Kwang Soo fruits, Kwang Soo is the truthful one.)

852
00:35:24.842 --> 00:35:27.945
(What is she going to give him?)

853
00:35:29.547 --> 00:35:32.550
(The correct answer is fruits.)

854
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.318
- Yes! - Yes!

855
00:35:34.318 --> 00:35:38.089
(So Min was lying.)

856
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:40.525
(So Min and those who believed her are going to be penalized.)

857
00:35:40.525 --> 00:35:42.160
Of course, she didn't swear.

858
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.528
Of course.

859
00:35:44.662 --> 00:35:45.930
It was wrong.

860
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.965
(We were fooled by So Min.)

861
00:35:48.699 --> 00:35:50.301
- Of course, it was fruits. - By the way,

862
00:35:50.301 --> 00:35:53.070
you guys are so sweet.

863
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.972
- I had never tried them. - It's so heartwarming.

864
00:35:54.972 --> 00:35:56.908
- They're called lychees. - Throughout her ride,

865
00:35:56.908 --> 00:35:59.177
she must have wanted to give the fruits to Kwang Soo.

866
00:35:59.177 --> 00:36:01.045
- It's so sweet of her. - It's so heartwarming.

867
00:36:01.045 --> 00:36:06.951
(She carried the fruits throughout her ride.)

868
00:36:06.951 --> 00:36:08.553
(I'm going to give him fruits.)

869
00:36:09.387 --> 00:36:11.589
So Min, it's so sweet of you.

870
00:36:12.924 --> 00:36:13.925
What's this?

871
00:36:13.925 --> 00:36:15.526
(She takes them out of her pocket.)

872
00:36:15.526 --> 00:36:16.861
- What are all these? - They're fruits.

873
00:36:17.528 --> 00:36:20.131
I brought them for you.

874
00:36:20.565 --> 00:36:22.567
- Did you eat them? - Yes, I ate a lot.

875
00:36:22.567 --> 00:36:24.535
(I brought them in my pocket for you.)

876
00:36:24.535 --> 00:36:26.471
Don't eat the seed.

877
00:36:26.838 --> 00:36:29.006
Eat the skin too. It tastes good, right?

878
00:36:29.507 --> 00:36:30.908
Are you okay?

879
00:36:30.908 --> 00:36:31.976
Yes, I am.

880
00:36:31.976 --> 00:36:33.110
(She successfully delivered the fruits to Kwang Soo.)

881
00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.780
- I'm okay. - Are you mentally okay?

882
00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.115
I actually panicked a little during the ride...

883
00:36:38.115 --> 00:36:39.116
because...

884
00:36:39.183 --> 00:36:40.718
(The waves crash again.)

885
00:36:42.453 --> 00:36:44.722
The car wobbled during your ride too.

886
00:36:44.722 --> 00:36:46.023
You were invisible for a moment.

887
00:36:46.023 --> 00:36:48.526
When I looked back, you were looking at your phone.

888
00:36:48.526 --> 00:36:51.429
You were sitting down, looking at your phone.

889
00:36:51.429 --> 00:36:52.697
(That's not true.)

890
00:36:54.565 --> 00:36:55.867
(Truth or Lie Quiz is finished.)

891
00:36:55.867 --> 00:36:58.069
- It brings back memories. - I don't want to go on that swing.

892
00:36:58.336 --> 00:36:59.504
Gosh.

893
00:36:59.737 --> 00:37:03.007
So Min, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo will receive penalty badges.

894
00:37:03.007 --> 00:37:04.575
I'm doomed. I already have two.

895
00:37:04.642 --> 00:37:05.676
(What have they done wrong?)

896
00:37:05.943 --> 00:37:08.379
- Se Chan is doomed. - He is.

897
00:37:08.746 --> 00:37:10.314
- We don't know yet, right? - We don't.

898
00:37:10.314 --> 00:37:12.183
Someone might get more than him.

899
00:37:12.183 --> 00:37:14.218
Right. Gosh, that was a mistake.

900
00:37:14.218 --> 00:37:15.453
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan get penalty badges.)

901
00:37:15.453 --> 00:37:17.255
- So Min... - I'm sorry.

902
00:37:17.255 --> 00:37:20.525
A cameraman has to be there too,

903
00:37:20.525 --> 00:37:21.926
so only two people will ride the swing.

904
00:37:21.926 --> 00:37:22.927
(Only 1 person will go on it.)

905
00:37:23.528 --> 00:37:25.863
- Only 2 people total. - Only 1 of us?

906
00:37:25.863 --> 00:37:27.932
All the cameramen look so shocked.

907
00:37:27.932 --> 00:37:30.067
(A cameraman has to be there.)

908
00:37:30.468 --> 00:37:32.637
Right?

909
00:37:32.637 --> 00:37:34.138
(One of us will be there?)

910
00:37:34.138 --> 00:37:36.774
Have the cameramen agreed on this?

911
00:37:36.774 --> 00:37:39.410
Why don't our cameramen play rock-paper-scissors?

912
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:40.444
That sounds good.

913
00:37:40.444 --> 00:37:42.380
- Let's do that. - Rock-paper-scissors.

914
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.548
The cameramen will play rock-paper-scissors.

915
00:37:43.548 --> 00:37:46.817
Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and So Min's cameramen, please come out.

916
00:37:46.984 --> 00:37:49.320
Seong Oh hates these things.

917
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.589
Rock-paper-scissors. Ready.

918
00:37:51.956 --> 00:37:53.858
(The loser will be penalized.)

919
00:37:53.858 --> 00:37:54.892
Please.

920
00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.162
(The cameramen will determine...)

921
00:37:58.162 --> 00:38:00.965
(the members and their own fates.)

922
00:38:00.965 --> 00:38:05.870
(The loser and a member will go on the swing.)

923
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:07.905
(Who will that be?)

924
00:38:07.905 --> 00:38:12.276
(Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and So Min's cameramen)

925
00:38:12.276 --> 00:38:14.545
(Ji Hyo's cameraman loses.)

926
00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:17.448
All right! Yes!

927
00:38:17.448 --> 00:38:24.155
(Chan Gyu and Ji Hyo are going to ride the swing.)

928
00:38:24.155 --> 00:38:25.723
He's so bad.

929
00:38:25.723 --> 00:38:28.225
- I was so surprised. - How is that possible?

930
00:38:28.659 --> 00:38:32.363
Ji Hyo will ride the swing.

931
00:38:33.464 --> 00:38:35.066
I'm escaping many dangers today.

932
00:38:35.366 --> 00:38:37.568
Ji Hyo, I didn't expect you to go on that swing.

933
00:38:37.568 --> 00:38:39.337
Neither did I.

934
00:38:39.337 --> 00:38:43.174
(I didn't expect it either.)

935
00:38:43.174 --> 00:38:44.175
Ji Hyo.

936
00:38:44.175 --> 00:38:45.943
(Are you okay?)

937
00:38:47.545 --> 00:38:51.182
(I miss my mom.)

938
00:38:51.182 --> 00:38:53.784
Why did you lose?

939
00:38:54.452 --> 00:38:56.554
Why did you lose rock-paper-scissors?

940
00:38:58.856 --> 00:39:01.525
(Sorry)

941
00:39:01.525 --> 00:39:03.928
(It's not enough to be the lucky one yourself.)

942
00:39:03.928 --> 00:39:06.931
It's at least better than Nevis Swing.

943
00:39:08.699 --> 00:39:10.968
Maybe it's a good thing.

944
00:39:11.469 --> 00:39:13.237
- Ji Hyo is the only one... - Ji Hyo is the only one...

945
00:39:13.237 --> 00:39:14.305
- who can do this. - who can do this.

946
00:39:14.305 --> 00:39:15.740
Among all of us.

947
00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.174
She's the bravest one.

948
00:39:17.174 --> 00:39:19.143
She's my hero.

949
00:39:20.444 --> 00:39:27.218
(She did the 233m bungee jump in Macau.)

950
00:39:27.218 --> 00:39:32.056
(She's successfully managed many extreme sports.)

951
00:39:32.056 --> 00:39:34.925
(Ji Hyo is the queen of extreme sports.)

952
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.028
(You're the only one who can smile in this situation.)

953
00:39:37.028 --> 00:39:38.696
Ji Hyo.

954
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.866
Are you okay?

955
00:39:41.966 --> 00:39:45.569
I'm scared too.

956
00:39:46.003 --> 00:39:48.739
Just so you know, Bo Gum has done it.

957
00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.741
- He has? - Really?

958
00:39:51.175 --> 00:39:52.777
That's great.

959
00:39:53.678 --> 00:39:58.382
(Bo Gum is Ji Hyo's favorite.)

960
00:39:58.382 --> 00:40:02.887
(She was so thrilled when she took a picture with him.)

961
00:40:02.887 --> 00:40:05.456
(If Bo Gum was with me,)

962
00:40:05.456 --> 00:40:09.760
(I could do it a hundred times.)

963
00:40:11.495 --> 00:40:14.532
(Sorry, I'm the one who will be with you.)

964
00:40:15.032 --> 00:40:16.801
You look great.

965
00:40:17.134 --> 00:40:18.736
You look fantastic.

966
00:40:19.203 --> 00:40:20.838
(Thumbs up)

967
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.841
This is crazy.

968
00:40:23.841 --> 00:40:27.845
(The swing ascends.)

969
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.718
Mom, Dad, friends, Running Man members,

970
00:40:34.552 --> 00:40:35.953
and the staff,

971
00:40:36.887 --> 00:40:38.589
thank you for everything.

972
00:40:38.656 --> 00:40:40.424
(Why is she making a confession?)

973
00:40:40.424 --> 00:40:43.427
Chan Gyu, I don't blame you.

974
00:40:43.427 --> 00:40:44.528
(We're in this together.)

975
00:40:44.929 --> 00:40:46.063
We can do this.

976
00:40:46.363 --> 00:40:47.865
Ji Hyo, are you okay?

977
00:40:48.265 --> 00:40:50.034
I don't know. I'm scared.

978
00:40:50.034 --> 00:40:51.068
Ji Hyo!

979
00:40:51.068 --> 00:40:53.204
It's going up so high.

980
00:40:53.404 --> 00:40:55.573
It's going up too high.

981
00:40:55.573 --> 00:40:57.007
(My goodness.)

982
00:40:57.007 --> 00:40:59.009
Gosh, it's too high.

983
00:41:00.044 --> 00:41:02.179
This is not okay!

984
00:41:02.947 --> 00:41:05.316
- Ji Hyo. - I can't watch it.

985
00:41:05.316 --> 00:41:07.585
How high is it going?

986
00:41:07.885 --> 00:41:09.487
Gosh.

987
00:41:09.487 --> 00:41:11.722
Are we there?

988
00:41:11.989 --> 00:41:12.990
You can do this!

989
00:41:13.357 --> 00:41:14.725
(Screaming)

990
00:41:15.426 --> 00:41:16.427
(Jae Seok's legs fail him.)

991
00:41:16.427 --> 00:41:17.428
Gosh.

992
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.198
We'll count down for you.

993
00:41:21.198 --> 00:41:22.199
(Countdown)

994
00:41:22.199 --> 00:41:27.138
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

995
00:41:27.338 --> 00:41:28.339
Let's go!

996
00:41:28.339 --> 00:41:32.176
(Launching)

997
00:41:32.176 --> 00:41:36.714
(Plunging)

998
00:41:36.714 --> 00:41:38.015
(Screaming)

999
00:41:39.049 --> 00:41:42.987
(Cutting through the wind,)

1000
00:41:42.987 --> 00:41:45.756
(the swing plunges.)

1001
00:41:46.924 --> 00:41:50.928
(Shocked)

1002
00:41:50.928 --> 00:41:52.096
(It comes back at an incredible speed too.)

1003
00:41:52.096 --> 00:41:53.130
Gosh.

1004
00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.567
(It comes back at an incredible speed too.)

1005
00:41:56.567 --> 00:41:58.569
(Ji Hyo is smiling.)

1006
00:41:58.569 --> 00:42:00.404
(So is the cameraman.)

1007
00:42:00.404 --> 00:42:02.840
(They're both so brave.)

1008
00:42:03.374 --> 00:42:06.010
They're not even screaming.

1009
00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:09.046
(The others are holding their breaths as they watch.)

1010
00:42:09.446 --> 00:42:12.683
- This is crazy. - It's incredible.

1011
00:42:13.484 --> 00:42:15.386
You look like Wonder Woman.

1012
00:42:16.987 --> 00:42:19.356
Superman!

1013
00:42:19.423 --> 00:42:22.326
- Superman! - Superman!

1014
00:42:23.027 --> 00:42:26.163
(Mapo-gu is under my protection.)

1015
00:42:26.964 --> 00:42:29.133
We survived.

1016
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.435
- We're still alive. - That's amazing.

1017
00:42:31.635 --> 00:42:34.138
- We survived. - Ji Hyo, you're amazing.

1018
00:42:34.338 --> 00:42:36.240
- We're still alive! - Superman!

1019
00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.274
(Ji Hyo is incredible.)

1020
00:42:37.908 --> 00:42:38.909
Superman.

1021
00:42:38.909 --> 00:42:40.744
I have so much respect for you.

1022
00:42:41.645 --> 00:42:43.714
A big respect for you.

1023
00:42:45.282 --> 00:42:47.051
It's you guys next time.

1024
00:42:47.051 --> 00:42:48.819
- You're going on Nevis Swing. - I respect you.

1025
00:42:48.819 --> 00:42:49.954
I respect you.

1026
00:42:49.954 --> 00:42:51.956
- I respect you. - You're going on Nevis Swing.

1027
00:42:52.256 --> 00:42:54.258
Which was scarier, bungee jumping in Macau or this?

1028
00:42:54.658 --> 00:42:55.659
This was a bit scarier.

1029
00:42:55.659 --> 00:42:57.027
- Really? - Really?

1030
00:42:57.428 --> 00:42:58.996
It must be really scary.

1031
00:42:58.996 --> 00:43:00.865
If Ji Hyo says so...

1032
00:43:01.966 --> 00:43:02.967
We survived.

1033
00:43:02.967 --> 00:43:04.068
(They've safely landed.)

1034
00:43:04.068 --> 00:43:05.135
We're still alive.

1035
00:43:05.135 --> 00:43:08.072
(Ji Hyo's swing ride is finished.)

1036
00:43:09.573 --> 00:43:11.775
- Let me summarize it for you. - Okay.

1037
00:43:11.775 --> 00:43:14.545
Se Chan has the most penalty badges.

1038
00:43:14.845 --> 00:43:17.781
- He has three. - He's doomed.

1039
00:43:17.781 --> 00:43:19.383
(Se Chan is likely to be penalized.)

1040
00:43:19.383 --> 00:43:22.953
So Min and Jong Kook have two badges each.

1041
00:43:23.454 --> 00:43:24.955
The other members have one each.

1042
00:43:25.155 --> 00:43:27.091
There's only one more person who has two.

1043
00:43:27.091 --> 00:43:29.026
I'm at risk.

1044
00:43:29.026 --> 00:43:30.427
Is it decided that I'll be penalized?

1045
00:43:30.995 --> 00:43:31.996
We don't know yet.

1046
00:43:31.996 --> 00:43:34.465
- We don't? - No. Those with two badges...

1047
00:43:34.465 --> 00:43:36.133
- might receive more. - That's right.

1048
00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:37.301
That's right.

1049
00:43:37.301 --> 00:43:39.069
She and I should give different answers.

1050
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:40.237
- That's right. - We should give different answers.

1051
00:43:40.237 --> 00:43:41.972
Think about this.

1052
00:43:42.072 --> 00:43:43.574
If the two of you answer correctly...

1053
00:43:43.741 --> 00:43:45.910
and the ones with 1 badge come to have 2 badges,

1054
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.111
- 4 people will compete. - 4 people will have 2 badges each.

1055
00:43:47.111 --> 00:43:48.779
- Okay. - That makes sense.

1056
00:43:48.879 --> 00:43:50.781
In that case, what does the one with three badges do?

1057
00:43:51.048 --> 00:43:52.783
If that happens, the one with three badges,

1058
00:43:52.783 --> 00:43:55.819
you, will choose among the ones with two badges.

1059
00:43:55.819 --> 00:43:56.954
- Do I get to choose? - Yes.

1060
00:43:57.488 --> 00:43:59.657
- That's a good idea. - Let's get it.

1061
00:43:59.657 --> 00:44:02.927
Here comes the fourth problem.

1062
00:44:02.927 --> 00:44:05.162
Play the video.

1063
00:44:05.429 --> 00:44:08.198
(Tiger Moth Penalty Tour, The 4th problem)

1064
00:44:08.632 --> 00:44:10.067
Let's go and get crayfish.

1065
00:44:10.067 --> 00:44:11.535
- What does crayfish look like? - Wait for me, Kwang Soo.

1066
00:44:11.535 --> 00:44:13.837
- I wonder what it looks like. - Doesn't it look fragile?

1067
00:44:13.904 --> 00:44:15.072
You will be surprised when you see it.

1068
00:44:15.072 --> 00:44:16.507
- Why? Is it because it's big? - It's my first time seeing it.

1069
00:44:16.507 --> 00:44:17.975
- It's my first time seeing it. - It's incredible.

1070
00:44:17.975 --> 00:44:20.544
- This place looks cool. - It's a cave.

1071
00:44:20.544 --> 00:44:21.779
- It looks cool. - Is it a cave?

1072
00:44:21.779 --> 00:44:23.380
(Are the crayfish here?)

1073
00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.382
It's fascinating how people made this structure.

1074
00:44:26.717 --> 00:44:28.085
- There is a crab. - It must be here.

1075
00:44:28.085 --> 00:44:29.820
- Crayfish live there. - This must be it.

1076
00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.222
There were crabs too.

1077
00:44:32.356 --> 00:44:34.258
- There is a crab. - This must be it.

1078
00:44:34.725 --> 00:44:36.393
There is crayfish.

1079
00:44:37.695 --> 00:44:38.796
Where?

1080
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.166
Is that crayfish? It looks like a lobster.

1081
00:44:42.633 --> 00:44:44.835
- It looks like a lobster. - Is this crayfish?

1082
00:44:45.302 --> 00:44:46.370
Why is it so big?

1083
00:44:47.137 --> 00:44:49.640
- Isn't that a lobster? - It's crayfish.

1084
00:44:50.007 --> 00:44:52.409
- It's huge. - It is.

1085
00:44:52.676 --> 00:44:54.278
- That's crayfish? - Yes.

1086
00:44:54.378 --> 00:44:56.914
There are two crabs.

1087
00:44:56.914 --> 00:44:59.383
(The local fisherman gives them the crabs too.)

1088
00:45:00.951 --> 00:45:01.986
Wait a minute.

1089
00:45:02.319 --> 00:45:04.588
This is "The Law of Jungle".

1090
00:45:04.588 --> 00:45:05.756
(I've seen this somewhere.)

1091
00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:08.158
It really is "The Law of Jungle".

1092
00:45:08.158 --> 00:45:09.760
It would have been complete with Kim Byung Man.

1093
00:45:12.563 --> 00:45:14.365
(Kwang Soo and So Min succeed in catching crayfish and crabs.)

1094
00:45:14.365 --> 00:45:15.666
- My goodness. - There are two crabs.

1095
00:45:15.866 --> 00:45:17.968
- The color is different. - That's a lobster.

1096
00:45:17.968 --> 00:45:19.136
- How pretty! - No, it's crayfish.

1097
00:45:19.136 --> 00:45:20.237
- Is that crayfish? - Look at this.

1098
00:45:20.237 --> 00:45:22.639
It's hanging on to the trap.

1099
00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.907
I have never seen this kind of a crab before.

1100
00:45:24.274 --> 00:45:25.576
(Hello, crabs with a blue carapace.)

1101
00:45:25.576 --> 00:45:27.011
They look like a porcelain.

1102
00:45:28.879 --> 00:45:31.048
- Thank you so much. - It's a lobster.

1103
00:45:31.315 --> 00:45:33.984
- It doesn't look like crayfish. - That one is on the small side.

1104
00:45:33.984 --> 00:45:36.820
You are watching Running Man.

1105
00:45:39.256 --> 00:45:41.158
(Do you want to see crab roe?)

1106
00:45:41.158 --> 00:45:42.159
- It's roe. - It has roe.

1107
00:45:42.426 --> 00:45:45.029
(It is filled with roe.)

1108
00:45:45.029 --> 00:45:46.063
(Telur means "Roe".)

1109
00:45:46.864 --> 00:45:48.165
- Did he say, "Daughter"? - May we try it now?

1110
00:45:48.165 --> 00:45:49.700
It's a daughter, not a son.

1111
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.068
It means "Roe".

1112
00:45:51.435 --> 00:45:52.970
Daughters.

1113
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:55.005
I am sorry.

1114
00:45:55.239 --> 00:45:57.775
This crab is foaming.

1115
00:45:58.776 --> 00:45:59.910
May we try it now?

1116
00:46:00.177 --> 00:46:01.845
Do you want to try it raw?

1117
00:46:01.945 --> 00:46:03.280
Crab roe can be eaten raw.

1118
00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.282
Can crab roe be eaten raw?

1119
00:46:06.683 --> 00:46:10.354
While it tastes a bit fishy, you can eat it raw.

1120
00:46:10.821 --> 00:46:12.723
(This is how you eat it.)

1121
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:14.658
You should try it.

1122
00:46:15.626 --> 00:46:16.693
How fascinating!

1123
00:46:16.693 --> 00:46:17.761
Try it.

1124
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:19.196
This is my first time seeing crab roe like this.

1125
00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:22.299
(He carefully gives it a taste.)

1126
00:46:23.634 --> 00:46:25.569
- How does it taste? - It's delicious. It tastes nutty.

1127
00:46:25.569 --> 00:46:26.603
Is it delicious?

1128
00:46:26.603 --> 00:46:27.704
- Did it taste nutty? - It was good.

1129
00:46:27.704 --> 00:46:29.506
- Wasn't it salty? - It was nutty.

1130
00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.108
- It's good, right? - Yes.

1131
00:46:31.675 --> 00:46:33.010
I have seen this scene from somewhere.

1132
00:46:35.412 --> 00:46:36.713
It was "The Law of Jungle".

1133
00:46:38.182 --> 00:46:39.450
It was "The Law of Jungle".

1134
00:46:41.185 --> 00:46:42.986
People on that program look dirty...

1135
00:46:43.487 --> 00:46:45.155
because they can't take a shower.

1136
00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:47.524
You can't say that just because I touched a crab.

1137
00:46:47.925 --> 00:46:49.660
This is fascinating. They are really pretty.

1138
00:46:49.893 --> 00:46:50.994
- Let's go. - Do we need to carry them?

1139
00:46:50.994 --> 00:46:52.196
Let's get going.

1140
00:46:52.696 --> 00:46:53.797
I don't think that part is edible.

1141
00:46:53.797 --> 00:46:56.133
- Are we taking the cable car? - Yes, we are.

1142
00:46:57.234 --> 00:46:59.136
(Are we taking the cable car?)

1143
00:46:59.136 --> 00:47:01.338
How are we going back?

1144
00:47:02.139 --> 00:47:03.373
I don't want to go on it.

1145
00:47:04.141 --> 00:47:06.543
The waves were really scary. There are no waves under the bridge.

1146
00:47:06.543 --> 00:47:08.378
(I prefer walking across the bridge.)

1147
00:47:08.378 --> 00:47:09.780
Try walking on the bridge.

1148
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.049
If it's okay, I will follow you.

1149
00:47:15.285 --> 00:47:16.887
(The producer goes first.)

1150
00:47:16.887 --> 00:47:18.055
He is going.

1151
00:47:23.026 --> 00:47:24.995
Let's go. This is better.

1152
00:47:26.663 --> 00:47:29.032
Kwang Soo is a man.

1153
00:47:29.032 --> 00:47:30.367
He takes the lead.

1154
00:47:30.534 --> 00:47:32.302
This is my choice.

1155
00:47:32.302 --> 00:47:34.838
(He charges forward like a man.)

1156
00:47:34.838 --> 00:47:39.543
(There is nothing scary about a short walk.)

1157
00:47:42.346 --> 00:47:43.380
It's shaky.

1158
00:47:44.047 --> 00:47:45.115
It's shaky.

1159
00:47:45.115 --> 00:47:47.484
(The spirited man who took the lead turns back.)

1160
00:47:47.484 --> 00:47:49.486
The bridge is shaky.

1161
00:47:49.486 --> 00:47:50.487
Really?

1162
00:47:50.754 --> 00:47:53.624
Si Yeon, you should go first.

1163
00:47:54.892 --> 00:47:55.926
You should go first.

1164
00:47:55.926 --> 00:47:57.895
Don't add weight to the bridge.

1165
00:47:58.428 --> 00:47:59.696
- Seriously. - Hurry up.

1166
00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.431
(Why do these combinations look familiar?)

1167
00:48:01.431 --> 00:48:02.566
She wants you to go first.

1168
00:48:02.966 --> 00:48:04.067
She wants you to go first.

1169
00:48:05.302 --> 00:48:10.407
(Kwang Soo and Yoon Sang were a duo at Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

1170
00:48:12.743 --> 00:48:19.416
(So Min and Si Yeon were a duo with a tearful welcoming ceremony.)

1171
00:48:20.884 --> 00:48:23.253
She wants you to go first.

1172
00:48:24.588 --> 00:48:27.090
- Come on. - I can't take a follow shot.

1173
00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:28.425
(I am too scared.)

1174
00:48:28.926 --> 00:48:30.928
- Come on. - I can't do it.

1175
00:48:31.295 --> 00:48:33.764
Don't move all at once.

1176
00:48:33.797 --> 00:48:35.465
Come on.

1177
00:48:35.465 --> 00:48:39.203
(The junior cameraman, Si Yeon, moves forward in the end.)

1178
00:48:40.971 --> 00:48:42.639
Don't look down. Don't look down.

1179
00:48:43.106 --> 00:48:44.675
Go quickly because I am scared.

1180
00:48:45.075 --> 00:48:47.177
(Don't look back either, So Min.)

1181
00:48:47.177 --> 00:48:49.379
I am sorry for suggesting to take this route.

1182
00:48:49.379 --> 00:48:53.884
(He walks back because he is scared.)

1183
00:48:53.884 --> 00:48:56.720
(This route isn't any easier.)

1184
00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.589
It's really windy.

1185
00:48:58.989 --> 00:49:00.357
I won't go this way.

1186
00:49:00.357 --> 00:49:01.758
(I am sorry. You should go ahead.)

1187
00:49:01.758 --> 00:49:03.393
No, I won't go this way.

1188
00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.295
(An angry wave intimidates the tiger moths.)

1189
00:49:05.295 --> 00:49:07.164
The wave is so big.

1190
00:49:07.164 --> 00:49:08.565
It came up as high as the bridge.

1191
00:49:08.565 --> 00:49:10.968
I won't go this way.

1192
00:49:10.968 --> 00:49:12.869
Let's go. Let's go.

1193
00:49:13.804 --> 00:49:16.106
- We must go when the sea is calm. - What should I do?

1194
00:49:16.106 --> 00:49:18.008
What should I do? The bridge is shaking.

1195
00:49:18.508 --> 00:49:19.843
For goodness' sake.

1196
00:49:19.843 --> 00:49:21.778
(With Kwang Soo's encouragement, she gathers up her courage.)

1197
00:49:24.214 --> 00:49:27.484
(I don't think I am ready for this.)

1198
00:49:27.484 --> 00:49:34.424
(He is going back from the middle.)

1199
00:49:39.796 --> 00:49:41.031
(If you can't avoid it, overcome it.)

1200
00:49:41.031 --> 00:49:43.834
What should I do?

1201
00:49:43.834 --> 00:49:46.136
(Let's pick up the pace and cross the bridge quickly.)

1202
00:49:48.338 --> 00:49:50.507
You are almost there. Stay strong just a while longer.

1203
00:49:57.714 --> 00:49:59.950
Go quickly. Go quickly.

1204
00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:01.218
Go quickly.

1205
00:50:01.985 --> 00:50:05.589
(They finally reach the land.)

1206
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:06.757
How scary!

1207
00:50:07.157 --> 00:50:09.426
My legs are shaking.

1208
00:50:09.426 --> 00:50:11.094
It was so scary.

1209
00:50:11.094 --> 00:50:13.263
(Kwang Soo is coming safely, right?)

1210
00:50:13.964 --> 00:50:15.032
Are you okay?

1211
00:50:15.699 --> 00:50:17.734
(No, I am not.)

1212
00:50:17.734 --> 00:50:20.137
- My hands are shaking. - I think I lost weight.

1213
00:50:20.137 --> 00:50:25.242
(The duo of scared men is at a standstill.)

1214
00:50:25.409 --> 00:50:28.045
(I can't take a step forward.)

1215
00:50:28.879 --> 00:50:32.816
(They remain standing on the bridge for a long time.)

1216
00:50:32.949 --> 00:50:35.218
- I have no strength. - I used up all my energy.

1217
00:50:35.218 --> 00:50:38.088
- My legs are shaking. - I used up three days' worth of it.

1218
00:50:38.455 --> 00:50:41.024
Now, it's time to try...

1219
00:50:41.024 --> 00:50:42.926
crayfish of Indonesia.

1220
00:50:42.926 --> 00:50:44.428
- Crayfish. - Crayfish.

1221
00:50:44.428 --> 00:50:45.762
(Come on, crayfish.)

1222
00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:49.733
(It's time for the seafood party they've been dreaming of.)

1223
00:50:50.834 --> 00:50:52.235
I wonder how it tastes.

1224
00:50:52.235 --> 00:50:53.503
I can't describe it with words.

1225
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.005
My goodness.

1226
00:50:55.005 --> 00:50:56.273
- How pretty! - The crabs are so pretty.

1227
00:50:56.273 --> 00:50:57.741
- They're not seasoned. - They are really pretty.

1228
00:50:57.841 --> 00:51:00.944
You will see that we have brought your luggage.

1229
00:51:00.944 --> 00:51:02.012
Yes.

1230
00:51:02.012 --> 00:51:04.114
(It's the luggage they have forgotten about.)

1231
00:51:04.781 --> 00:51:06.316
From your luggage,

1232
00:51:06.316 --> 00:51:10.087
please choose and bring two items you need.

1233
00:51:12.322 --> 00:51:13.523
- Right now? - Two items each?

1234
00:51:13.523 --> 00:51:14.524
Two items each.

1235
00:51:14.524 --> 00:51:15.592
(We are on Tiger Moth Tour.)

1236
00:51:15.592 --> 00:51:17.594
(The person with higher amount of mission money remaining wins.)

1237
00:51:17.594 --> 00:51:19.096
Don't you think you should give us a change of clothes?

1238
00:51:20.063 --> 00:51:22.032
- I need a change of clothes. - We need that much.

1239
00:51:22.032 --> 00:51:23.200
(Taking out an item from the luggage costs 30 dollars.)

1240
00:51:23.433 --> 00:51:25.035
(Kwang Soo opens his luggage.)

1241
00:51:25.035 --> 00:51:26.303
You have so many clothes.

1242
00:51:27.137 --> 00:51:29.639
(What should I take out?)

1243
00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.242
How much time do we have?

1244
00:51:32.476 --> 00:51:33.677
For goodness' sake.

1245
00:51:34.945 --> 00:51:36.546
(Why do I need to do this?)

1246
00:51:36.546 --> 00:51:37.714
For goodness' sake.

1247
00:51:38.315 --> 00:51:40.117
He is truly annoyed.

1248
00:51:40.117 --> 00:51:41.818
Kwang Soo, children are watching. Calm down.

1249
00:51:42.486 --> 00:51:43.587
It's nothing.

1250
00:51:43.754 --> 00:51:46.156
Look at that fake smile.

1251
00:51:46.156 --> 00:51:47.324
Kwang Soo.

1252
00:51:47.758 --> 00:51:48.859
(Don't be mad, Kwang Soo.)

1253
00:51:49.626 --> 00:51:51.695
Take out what you need.

1254
00:51:51.695 --> 00:51:52.696
(What should I take out?)

1255
00:51:52.696 --> 00:51:54.698
Take out what you need. My goodness, there is ramyeon.

1256
00:51:54.698 --> 00:51:55.799
In that situation,

1257
00:51:56.366 --> 00:51:58.468
- ramyeon was the best. - Of course it was.

1258
00:51:58.468 --> 00:52:00.137
- Let's get ramyeon. - There's ramyeon.

1259
00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:02.506
Let's take out ramyeon. I really want it.

1260
00:52:02.606 --> 00:52:03.907
- Ramyeon? - Yes.

1261
00:52:03.907 --> 00:52:07.043
I need a top and a bottom.

1262
00:52:07.043 --> 00:52:08.044
You took this out already.

1263
00:52:08.044 --> 00:52:09.679
Let's pay 15 dollars each to take out ramyeon.

1264
00:52:09.679 --> 00:52:12.716
We are going to eat it together anyway.

1265
00:52:13.183 --> 00:52:15.886
We will pay 15 dollars each for ramyeon.

1266
00:52:15.886 --> 00:52:18.455
Let's pay 15 dollars each to take out ramyeon.

1267
00:52:18.455 --> 00:52:19.656
- Where is my t-shirt? - Currently,

1268
00:52:19.656 --> 00:52:21.658
So Min has 155 dollars.

1269
00:52:21.658 --> 00:52:23.093
You shouldn't reveal that.

1270
00:52:23.093 --> 00:52:24.628
Kwang Soo has 88 dollars.

1271
00:52:24.628 --> 00:52:26.930
I won't pay for ramyeon.

1272
00:52:27.764 --> 00:52:28.799
I won't eat it.

1273
00:52:29.566 --> 00:52:30.801
Are you sure about that?

1274
00:52:31.134 --> 00:52:32.335
- Yes. - You said you won't eat it.

1275
00:52:32.569 --> 00:52:34.004
I will pay 30 dollars to take out ramyeon.

1276
00:52:34.204 --> 00:52:35.305
- 30 dollars. - Yes.

1277
00:52:35.338 --> 00:52:36.406
Don't eat it.

1278
00:52:37.474 --> 00:52:38.508
Shoes.

1279
00:52:38.642 --> 00:52:39.843
Kwang Soo.

1280
00:52:41.044 --> 00:52:43.547
- Shoes and clothes. - A pack of clothes and shoes.

1281
00:52:44.114 --> 00:52:46.016
- So Min. - I will take out...

1282
00:52:46.049 --> 00:52:48.452
a top and a bottom.

1283
00:52:48.452 --> 00:52:50.086
I will pay for ramyeon.

1284
00:52:50.153 --> 00:52:52.989
A t-shirt, a pair of pants, and ramyeon for 30 dollars.

1285
00:52:52.989 --> 00:52:54.891
- Yes. - You paid for it.

1286
00:52:55.158 --> 00:52:56.660
We will now close the luggage.

1287
00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.395
(Taking out the 2 items comes to an end.)

1288
00:52:58.695 --> 00:53:01.064
- Let's go and eat. - Let's go.

1289
00:53:01.064 --> 00:53:04.468
- Please bring them in. - Please bring them in.

1290
00:53:04.634 --> 00:53:06.336
(Since they worked hard to catch them,)

1291
00:53:06.336 --> 00:53:10.273
(they are that much happier to finally eat crayfish.)

1292
00:53:10.273 --> 00:53:11.508
It looks so good.

1293
00:53:11.675 --> 00:53:12.876
Seriously.

1294
00:53:12.876 --> 00:53:14.778
- It looks tasty. - I can't describe it with words.

1295
00:53:14.778 --> 00:53:16.446
Were they steamed without any sauce?

1296
00:53:16.446 --> 00:53:18.548
Yes. There is a sauce for dipping.

1297
00:53:18.548 --> 00:53:19.616
- Really? - Yes.

1298
00:53:19.783 --> 00:53:21.384
- Is this the one I caught earlier? - Yes.

1299
00:53:21.384 --> 00:53:22.619
The color of the crabs changed.

1300
00:53:22.619 --> 00:53:24.754
They look like regular crabs when they are steamed.

1301
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:27.023
They are the ones we saw earlier.

1302
00:53:27.023 --> 00:53:28.158
(The crabs return to them after getting steamed.)

1303
00:53:28.158 --> 00:53:30.160
- Before you dig in... - Yes.

1304
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.195
- It looks delicious. - You see the crayfish...

1305
00:53:32.195 --> 00:53:33.563
- on a small plate, right? - Yes.

1306
00:53:34.197 --> 00:53:35.765
Try that first.

1307
00:53:35.765 --> 00:53:36.833
This?

1308
00:53:36.833 --> 00:53:38.735
- What's happening? - The tiny one.

1309
00:53:38.735 --> 00:53:39.736
This?

1310
00:53:39.736 --> 00:53:40.804
It's not a crayfish?

1311
00:53:41.004 --> 00:53:43.406
It is. Try it.

1312
00:53:44.007 --> 00:53:46.443
Be careful not to hurt your hands.

1313
00:53:47.043 --> 00:53:48.044
Look at all that flesh.

1314
00:53:48.678 --> 00:53:50.213
- You caught it? - It was a bit small.

1315
00:53:50.213 --> 00:53:52.382
(Soft flesh is hiding inside the hard shell.)

1316
00:53:52.382 --> 00:53:53.583
It must be expensive.

1317
00:53:53.817 --> 00:53:56.052
- It was so tasty. - It looks so tasty.

1318
00:53:56.586 --> 00:53:58.722
It looks so tasty.

1319
00:53:58.722 --> 00:54:00.524
It deserves a thumbs-up.

1320
00:54:00.524 --> 00:54:01.525
- This? - Yes.

1321
00:54:01.525 --> 00:54:02.626
(It's a gift from the sea.)

1322
00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.161
It feels like we're in a jungle.

1323
00:54:05.695 --> 00:54:07.564
You should pay for that trip.

1324
00:54:07.564 --> 00:54:09.766
- Totally. - It's not a penalty.

1325
00:54:10.233 --> 00:54:11.234
Thank you.

1326
00:54:14.471 --> 00:54:16.239
- How does it taste? - It tastes great.

1327
00:54:16.239 --> 00:54:17.274
It's so fresh.

1328
00:54:17.274 --> 00:54:18.475
(The taste is fabulous.)

1329
00:54:19.743 --> 00:54:21.278
It has so much flesh.

1330
00:54:21.278 --> 00:54:26.983
(It's steak from the sea.)

1331
00:54:27.684 --> 00:54:28.685
Look at this.

1332
00:54:28.685 --> 00:54:30.754
(Let me try some.)

1333
00:54:30.754 --> 00:54:32.155
That looks like a lobster.

1334
00:54:32.222 --> 00:54:33.256
It's so tasty.

1335
00:54:34.524 --> 00:54:35.725
You should dip it in sauce.

1336
00:54:38.495 --> 00:54:40.163
- It gave me goosebumps. - It tastes amazing.

1337
00:54:40.163 --> 00:54:41.164
But...

1338
00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:45.235
for some reason, Kwang Soo doesn't make it look appetizing.

1339
00:54:45.302 --> 00:54:48.004
- He doesn't make it appetizing. - Look at it closely.

1340
00:54:48.004 --> 00:54:51.575
(Kwang Soo doesn't make food look appetizing.)

1341
00:54:52.242 --> 00:54:53.376
It tastes like meat.

1342
00:54:53.376 --> 00:54:56.179
(They're enjoying meat from the sea.)

1343
00:54:56.179 --> 00:54:59.382
It has so much flesh. I've never tasted anything like this.

1344
00:54:59.382 --> 00:55:00.684
The texture is so nice.

1345
00:55:01.818 --> 00:55:02.886
Does it taste good?

1346
00:55:02.986 --> 00:55:04.254
It tastes fantastic.

1347
00:55:04.254 --> 00:55:05.255
(It's beyond words.)

1348
00:55:05.722 --> 00:55:08.491
- The tasting session is over. - Sorry?

1349
00:55:08.491 --> 00:55:09.659
I knew it.

1350
00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:11.695
(Shocked)

1351
00:55:11.695 --> 00:55:14.464
Are you trying to be mean?

1352
00:55:15.932 --> 00:55:16.933
What's happening?

1353
00:55:16.933 --> 00:55:17.934
(Why are they taking it from us?)

1354
00:55:17.934 --> 00:55:19.736
How is this different from "12 Years a Slave"?

1355
00:55:19.736 --> 00:55:21.338
How is it different?

1356
00:55:22.639 --> 00:55:26.176
You're tasting crayfish.

1357
00:55:26.176 --> 00:55:27.344
(The producer gets to the point.)

1358
00:55:27.344 --> 00:55:29.679
It's quite rare in Yogyakarta too. Even locals...

1359
00:55:29.679 --> 00:55:31.881
- It must be. - don't get to taste it often.

1360
00:55:31.881 --> 00:55:33.717
Even locals don't get to taste it often.

1361
00:55:33.717 --> 00:55:36.086
You can choose to either retrieve some of your items...

1362
00:55:36.086 --> 00:55:38.054
or eat some more food.

1363
00:55:38.054 --> 00:55:41.424
Would you like to retrieve two of your items...

1364
00:55:41.491 --> 00:55:43.159
or eat more crayfish?

1365
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.527
If you choose crayfish,

1366
00:55:44.527 --> 00:55:47.697
you can continue to eat.

1367
00:55:47.697 --> 00:55:49.032
(If they give up on their items, they can eat more.)

1368
00:55:49.366 --> 00:55:51.968
- Just eat. - I choose my clothes.

1369
00:55:52.469 --> 00:55:55.138
(So Min chooses clothes over crayfish.)

1370
00:55:55.238 --> 00:55:56.473
What are you going to choose?

1371
00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.475
- What will Kwang Soo choose? - What are you going to choose?

1372
00:55:58.475 --> 00:56:00.410
- You should choose crayfish. - He'll choose crayfish.

1373
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:02.145
- I choose... - He'll choose crayfish.

1374
00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.180
- He definitely will. - I'm 100 percent sure.

1375
00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.518
What are you going to choose?

1376
00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:07.720
- What will Kwang Soo choose? - What are you going to choose?

1377
00:56:07.726 --> 00:56:09.350
- You should choose crayfish. - He'll choose crayfish.

1378
00:56:09.352 --> 00:56:11.087
- I choose... - He'll choose crayfish.

1379
00:56:11.087 --> 00:56:13.490
- He definitely will. - I'm 100 percent sure.

1380
00:56:13.723 --> 00:56:14.891
I choose crayfish.

1381
00:56:14.891 --> 00:56:16.593
(Crayfish)

1382
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:17.990
You choose crayfish.

1383
00:56:18.862 --> 00:56:22.090
Kwang Soo will continue to eat then.

1384
00:56:22.265 --> 00:56:23.833
I have no clothes.

1385
00:56:23.833 --> 00:56:25.435
Can I continue to eat?

1386
00:56:25.602 --> 00:56:26.870
Not everyone gets to taste it.

1387
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:28.405
- Right. - The flesh is...

1388
00:56:28.405 --> 00:56:30.407
- seasoned. - Really?

1389
00:56:31.207 --> 00:56:33.576
(That looks tasty.)

1390
00:56:33.576 --> 00:56:40.216
(It looks like she is breaking up with someone.)

1391
00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:42.118
Can he even eat that?

1392
00:56:42.118 --> 00:56:44.254
(Amazed)

1393
00:56:44.621 --> 00:56:46.823
(There is so much meat.)

1394
00:56:48.591 --> 00:56:49.893
My hands are big.

1395
00:56:49.893 --> 00:56:50.927
(I should have been there.)

1396
00:56:51.661 --> 00:56:54.297
(Amazed)

1397
00:56:54.297 --> 00:56:56.766
I choose crayfish.

1398
00:56:56.766 --> 00:56:58.935
(So Min changes her mind immediately.)

1399
00:56:58.935 --> 00:57:00.003
- Me too. - What's this?

1400
00:57:00.036 --> 00:57:01.571
I choose crayfish.

1401
00:57:01.604 --> 00:57:04.307
- Make up your mind. - I don't need clothes.

1402
00:57:04.374 --> 00:57:06.376
- Okay. - Let's have it together.

1403
00:57:06.376 --> 00:57:09.245
Let's share it. I can't help it.

1404
00:57:09.245 --> 00:57:11.147
- I have no choice. - You can't do this.

1405
00:57:11.147 --> 00:57:12.348
I was wrong.

1406
00:57:12.582 --> 00:57:14.017
(Excited)

1407
00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.421
It's incredible.

1408
00:57:18.421 --> 00:57:19.823
(It's dipped in chili sauce.)

1409
00:57:21.591 --> 00:57:23.827
(A big bite)

1410
00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.462
(Her eyes become big.)

1411
00:57:25.462 --> 00:57:27.197
- It tastes amazing. - Gosh.

1412
00:57:27.764 --> 00:57:28.998
It tastes so good.

1413
00:57:29.766 --> 00:57:31.668
That looks amazing. How did it taste?

1414
00:57:31.668 --> 00:57:32.802
It tasted amazing.

1415
00:57:32.936 --> 00:57:35.105
You forgot about your penalty.

1416
00:57:35.105 --> 00:57:36.673
It was just...

1417
00:57:36.673 --> 00:57:37.774
It hasn't been frozen.

1418
00:57:37.774 --> 00:57:40.376
It was 1 of the 5 tastiest foods I'd ever had.

1419
00:57:40.376 --> 00:57:41.411
- Really? - Yes.

1420
00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:45.315
(They fall in love with the taste of the crayfish.)

1421
00:57:47.117 --> 00:57:48.118
It tastes amazing.

1422
00:57:48.118 --> 00:57:49.986
(It's Kwang Soo's turn.)

1423
00:57:52.222 --> 00:57:53.289
Is this chili sauce?

1424
00:57:53.289 --> 00:57:57.093
(He skillfully removes the flesh and dips it in sauce.)

1425
00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:59.596
It tastes so good.

1426
00:57:59.596 --> 00:58:01.931
Has his face been enlarged?

1427
00:58:01.931 --> 00:58:03.733
It looks longer than before.

1428
00:58:03.733 --> 00:58:05.702
You look so ugly.

1429
00:58:05.702 --> 00:58:07.637
He looks like a horse.

1430
00:58:08.138 --> 00:58:09.606
The flesh is so soft.

1431
00:58:09.606 --> 00:58:11.207
It melts in your mouth.

1432
00:58:11.207 --> 00:58:13.743
They all taste different.

1433
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:15.979
It's amazing.

1434
00:58:15.979 --> 00:58:17.080
I've seen this somewhere.

1435
00:58:18.114 --> 00:58:20.250
Isn't this "Youn's Kitchen"?

1436
00:58:21.217 --> 00:58:22.786
(They're having food on the beach.)

1437
00:58:22.786 --> 00:58:23.887
Isn't this "Youn's Kitchen"?

1438
00:58:23.887 --> 00:58:25.388
(They're having food on the beach.)

1439
00:58:25.388 --> 00:58:26.656
You're Shin Gu.

1440
00:58:27.924 --> 00:58:29.959
- He's Shin Gu. - You're Youn Yuh Jung.

1441
00:58:30.493 --> 00:58:31.494
Jung Yu Mi is not here.

1442
00:58:32.128 --> 00:58:33.963
(You're watching Running Man.)

1443
00:58:33.963 --> 00:58:36.766
The flesh is so chewy.

1444
00:58:36.766 --> 00:58:38.234
(Their stomachs are filling up.)

1445
00:58:38.234 --> 00:58:40.703
I've never filled my mouth with shrimp before.

1446
00:58:40.703 --> 00:58:42.205
(Slurping)

1447
00:58:42.205 --> 00:58:43.206
This is the first time.

1448
00:58:43.206 --> 00:58:46.943
(So Min is slurping 30-dollar noodles.)

1449
00:58:48.144 --> 00:58:51.648
I feel pain in my chest.

1450
00:58:51.781 --> 00:58:52.916
- Why? - I don't know.

1451
00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:56.419
Isn't it because of instant noodles?

1452
00:58:56.419 --> 00:58:58.221
- No. - Are you okay?

1453
00:58:58.221 --> 00:58:59.222
(Can I have some?)

1454
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:02.292
I'm sorry, but I can't give you any.

1455
00:59:02.292 --> 00:59:03.293
(It cost 30 dollars.)

1456
00:59:03.493 --> 00:59:05.395
I gave up on my clothes.

1457
00:59:06.996 --> 00:59:10.567
(Kwang Soo uses crayfish to lure her.)

1458
00:59:11.534 --> 00:59:13.903
It's filled with flesh.

1459
00:59:13.903 --> 00:59:15.405
Let me have a bite.

1460
00:59:15.405 --> 00:59:17.874
- I'll have a bite first. - Okay.

1461
00:59:18.107 --> 00:59:19.576
Let me have a bite of your noodles.

1462
00:59:20.143 --> 00:59:22.011
(So Min's in a dilemma.)

1463
00:59:23.346 --> 00:59:24.714
(Check this out.)

1464
00:59:24.714 --> 00:59:26.416
- I'm tired. - Look at this.

1465
00:59:27.016 --> 00:59:28.251
That looks so tasty.

1466
00:59:28.251 --> 00:59:29.686
Let me have a bite of your noodles.

1467
00:59:29.686 --> 00:59:30.987
(Desperate)

1468
00:59:31.688 --> 00:59:32.689
Fine.

1469
00:59:32.689 --> 00:59:33.756
(You can have a bite.)

1470
00:59:34.057 --> 00:59:35.525
Let me have a bite of your noodles.

1471
00:59:36.492 --> 00:59:39.696
(So Min gets to have a bite of the crayfish.)

1472
00:59:41.231 --> 00:59:42.765
Did her tooth just fall out?

1473
00:59:42.765 --> 00:59:44.334
Right.

1474
00:59:44.334 --> 00:59:45.335
Have just one bite.

1475
00:59:45.335 --> 00:59:48.137
(Kwang Soo gets to try the noodles.)

1476
00:59:48.137 --> 00:59:49.606
It tastes amazing.

1477
00:59:50.206 --> 00:59:52.041
(One bite)

1478
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:54.878
(One big bite)

1479
00:59:54.878 --> 00:59:58.014
It tastes so good.

1480
01:00:04.587 --> 01:00:05.588
Hey!

1481
01:00:07.056 --> 01:00:08.658
(Empty)

1482
01:00:09.559 --> 01:00:13.696
(What is with this guy?)

1483
01:00:16.232 --> 01:00:18.234
He looks so ugly.

1484
01:00:18.234 --> 01:00:20.837
He ate everything.

1485
01:00:23.306 --> 01:00:25.441
After going into the water, instant noodles taste amazing.

1486
01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:27.844
(Angry)

1487
01:00:28.745 --> 01:00:31.114
- Give me some crab. - Okay.

1488
01:00:31.114 --> 01:00:34.484
Kwang Soo peeled all the crayfish for me.

1489
01:00:34.584 --> 01:00:37.020
- He deserved the noodles. - He's feeding her.

1490
01:00:38.688 --> 01:00:39.689
(Satisfied)

1491
01:00:39.689 --> 01:00:40.757
It tastes so good.

1492
01:00:41.024 --> 01:00:44.227
It tastes a bit lighter.

1493
01:00:46.596 --> 01:00:48.431
How can you be so good at peeling them?

1494
01:00:48.698 --> 01:00:51.000
You must have done it many times.

1495
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.436
- Are you jealous? - You must have done it many times.

1496
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.205
You've done it for many girls, right?

1497
01:00:56.205 --> 01:00:57.206
What are you talking about?

1498
01:00:57.974 --> 01:00:59.008
It tastes so good.

1499
01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:00.743
It shows.

1500
01:01:03.913 --> 01:01:04.948
Can you fry the heads for us?

1501
01:01:04.948 --> 01:01:06.382
(He changes the subject.)

1502
01:01:06.382 --> 01:01:08.551
- They usually do that. - They do.

1503
01:01:09.485 --> 01:01:12.221
Did you know? Shrimps are the cockroaches of the sea.

1504
01:01:13.623 --> 01:01:14.724
What do you mean?

1505
01:01:14.724 --> 01:01:16.826
They're called so.

1506
01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.695
Why?

1507
01:01:19.896 --> 01:01:24.901
(They take pictures to celebrate the successful trip.)

1508
01:01:25.835 --> 01:01:29.706
(I-Go Project is over. We did it!)

1509
01:01:31.207 --> 01:01:35.411
(They did some sightseeing on their own the next day.)

1510
01:01:35.411 --> 01:01:36.713
(Tiger Moth Tour is over.)

1511
01:01:36.713 --> 01:01:39.148
- You had so much fun. - Right.

1512
01:01:40.383 --> 01:01:45.955
(This question will determine who will receive the live show penalty.)

1513
01:01:46.823 --> 01:01:48.024
Kwang Soo looks like a celebrity.

1514
01:01:48.591 --> 01:01:51.027
His face looks bigger than Darth Vader's.

1515
01:01:51.194 --> 01:01:53.997
- It's because I'm in the front. - Are you sure?

1516
01:01:54.497 --> 01:01:55.932
I can't stop laughing.

1517
01:01:55.932 --> 01:01:57.500
(The memories make them laugh.)

1518
01:01:57.967 --> 01:02:00.870
Was everything just a dream?

1519
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:02.405
A midsummer night's dream.

1520
01:02:02.505 --> 01:02:07.076
Whoever will be going to Australia...

1521
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.878
I feel sorry for you.

1522
01:02:09.746 --> 01:02:11.447
It'll be harder than you imagine.

1523
01:02:12.315 --> 01:02:13.583
It's beyond your imagination.

1524
01:02:13.583 --> 01:02:15.451
- It was painful... - Really?

1525
01:02:15.685 --> 01:02:17.954
- and exhausting. - But we're still alive.

1526
01:02:18.154 --> 01:02:21.858
We managed to buy some souvenirs for you.

1527
01:02:21.858 --> 01:02:23.693
I bought what Seok Jin wanted too.

1528
01:02:23.926 --> 01:02:27.597
No, you didn't. I was watching you.

1529
01:02:27.597 --> 01:02:28.598
Again?

1530
01:02:28.698 --> 01:02:30.066
Attention, guys.

1531
01:02:30.633 --> 01:02:32.168
Is it whether he bought my present or not?

1532
01:02:32.435 --> 01:02:33.436
No way.

1533
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:36.072
I was with you the whole time. You didn't get it.

1534
01:02:36.506 --> 01:02:38.307
- He didn't get it. - On the last day,

1535
01:02:38.941 --> 01:02:40.443
I went with Chul Min.

1536
01:02:41.077 --> 01:02:43.613
I couldn't buy one for everybody,

1537
01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.548
but I got a small present.

1538
01:02:46.215 --> 01:02:48.117
No, he didn't. I'm sure.

1539
01:02:48.384 --> 01:02:49.519
Yesterday, I...

1540
01:02:50.186 --> 01:02:54.524
bought a present for sure.

1541
01:02:55.391 --> 01:02:58.394
(Kwang Soo claims that he bought small presents for the members.)

1542
01:02:58.494 --> 01:03:00.296
I assure you.

1543
01:03:00.463 --> 01:03:03.266
Kwang Soo never bought any presents.

1544
01:03:03.266 --> 01:03:06.536
(So Min claims that he's lying and that he didn't buy anything.)

1545
01:03:07.303 --> 01:03:09.005
I was so tired.

1546
01:03:09.005 --> 01:03:10.206
(Did Kwang Soo buy presents for the members?)

1547
01:03:10.206 --> 01:03:11.741
He mentioned it earlier.

1548
01:03:11.741 --> 01:03:14.277
Kwang Soo claims that he bought the presents,

1549
01:03:14.277 --> 01:03:16.712
and So Min claims that he didn't.

1550
01:03:16.712 --> 01:03:18.147
- Kwang Soo? - For us?

1551
01:03:18.147 --> 01:03:19.515
- Can it be for just one person? - I couldn't buy one for everybody.

1552
01:03:19.515 --> 01:03:20.516
I couldn't.

1553
01:03:20.516 --> 01:03:23.052
It's something memorable. We didn't film the last day.

1554
01:03:23.686 --> 01:03:24.921
- We couldn't film it, - I see.

1555
01:03:24.921 --> 01:03:26.456
so we went out on our own.

1556
01:03:26.456 --> 01:03:28.491
I bought a few memorable things.

1557
01:03:28.491 --> 01:03:31.094
- He usually buys presents. - He does.

1558
01:03:31.094 --> 01:03:34.464
Did the two of you go around together or separately?

1559
01:03:34.464 --> 01:03:35.598
We went around together.

1560
01:03:35.598 --> 01:03:37.700
- All day? - Yes, we went around together.

1561
01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:41.070
We ate with the camera crew.

1562
01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:43.106
- We went out without the cameras. - We went...

1563
01:03:43.506 --> 01:03:46.776
If there were no cameras, he probably didn't buy it.

1564
01:03:47.543 --> 01:03:48.945
What do you mean?

1565
01:03:48.945 --> 01:03:51.147
- Someone has to be filming him? - Yes.

1566
01:03:51.147 --> 01:03:53.416
(He likes to take credits for what he does.)

1567
01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:55.751
We went and when Kwang Soo came back to the hotel,

1568
01:03:55.751 --> 01:03:57.620
he only had a shopping bag.

1569
01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:00.056
He only had chocolate wrappers...

1570
01:04:00.056 --> 01:04:03.493
and trash. That was all he had in the white plastic bag.

1571
01:04:03.493 --> 01:04:04.560
(So Min argues that Kwang Soo came back with a plastic bag.)

1572
01:04:05.561 --> 01:04:09.432
(He did go around downtown with a plastic bag.)

1573
01:04:10.133 --> 01:04:12.902
Didn't you talk about Seok Jin's present earlier?

1574
01:04:12.902 --> 01:04:15.571
He asked me for something over the phone.

1575
01:04:15.671 --> 01:04:17.273
Did I? I told you to get something, right?

1576
01:04:17.273 --> 01:04:18.708
- You mentioned it. - Right,

1577
01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:20.843
- I remember. - He said it in the morning.

1578
01:04:20.843 --> 01:04:22.578
He called me and told me to get something.

1579
01:04:22.578 --> 01:04:24.347
I remember it clearly.

1580
01:04:24.347 --> 01:04:26.015
- I told him to get fish jerky. - Fish jerky?

1581
01:04:26.015 --> 01:04:27.250
- Fish jerky. - Jerky?

1582
01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:28.818
- You asked for the marinated ones. - The marinated ones...

1583
01:04:28.818 --> 01:04:30.853
- You didn't get it. - from Indonesia and Thailand.

1584
01:04:30.853 --> 01:04:32.021
- The spicy ones? - Yes, the spicy ones.

1585
01:04:32.021 --> 01:04:33.856
- I know. - You know, right?

1586
01:04:33.856 --> 01:04:34.991
- It's good. - We couldn't find them.

1587
01:04:34.991 --> 01:04:36.626
- He didn't get it. - It's the red one.

1588
01:04:36.626 --> 01:04:39.896
Hold on. If I didn't get it, why would I say that?

1589
01:04:40.796 --> 01:04:41.797
Why?

1590
01:04:42.765 --> 01:04:44.667
If he took his sunglasses off,

1591
01:04:44.667 --> 01:04:46.435
we could have seen his eyes.

1592
01:04:46.836 --> 01:04:48.471
You won't be able to tell.

1593
01:04:48.671 --> 01:04:51.007
If we knew, we wouldn't be here.

1594
01:04:51.007 --> 01:04:52.008
(Come on, Se Chan.)

1595
01:04:52.008 --> 01:04:53.976
(That's true.)

1596
01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:55.878
When did you get it?

1597
01:04:56.479 --> 01:04:58.281
- When was it? - I walked...

1598
01:04:58.281 --> 01:05:00.016
- You guys were together. - I walked from the restaurant...

1599
01:05:00.016 --> 01:05:02.051
- to the coffee shop. - You were walking.

1600
01:05:02.051 --> 01:05:04.687
- What did you buy on the way? - There were no coffee shops.

1601
01:05:04.687 --> 01:05:06.455
Where? Where was it?

1602
01:05:06.722 --> 01:05:08.591
- Where was it? - They had it.

1603
01:05:08.891 --> 01:05:10.326
On the way...

1604
01:05:10.393 --> 01:05:12.061
Hold on.

1605
01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:15.998
Are they playing detectives?

1606
01:05:16.265 --> 01:05:18.134
- It's called an interrogation. - An interrogation.

1607
01:05:18.434 --> 01:05:20.203
That's what I meant.

1608
01:05:20.203 --> 01:05:21.904
I knew I had to get it.

1609
01:05:21.904 --> 01:05:23.172
Was it a grocery store?

1610
01:05:23.372 --> 01:05:26.209
- Hey, did you get it or not? - You didn't see him?

1611
01:05:27.276 --> 01:05:28.678
- You punk. - Look at this guy.

1612
01:05:28.678 --> 01:05:30.379
What are you doing?

1613
01:05:30.713 --> 01:05:32.448
This is annoying. Did you get it or not?

1614
01:05:32.448 --> 01:05:34.016
I got it. I got it, Jae Seok.

1615
01:05:34.016 --> 01:05:35.084
- Did you? - Yes.

1616
01:05:35.218 --> 01:05:36.919
- He was busy taking pictures. - This is annoying. Did you get it?

1617
01:05:36.919 --> 01:05:39.055
- There was a lot of construction. - Did you?

1618
01:05:39.956 --> 01:05:41.791
Don't they look like a couple who defrauds people?

1619
01:05:41.991 --> 01:05:43.059
If I didn't get it...

1620
01:05:43.059 --> 01:05:44.660
(They are both tiger moths.)

1621
01:05:45.394 --> 01:05:47.964
Did you use cash or credit card?

1622
01:05:48.231 --> 01:05:49.498
- I used cash. - What did you say?

1623
01:05:49.498 --> 01:05:52.034
Stop lying. You brought a credit card with you.

1624
01:05:52.034 --> 01:05:53.202
I paid cash.

1625
01:05:53.202 --> 01:05:54.437
What did you say?

1626
01:05:54.437 --> 01:05:55.705
(Why is he stuttering?)

1627
01:05:55.705 --> 01:05:56.872
You didn't get a refund, right?

1628
01:05:57.773 --> 01:05:58.774
You didn't get a refund, right?

1629
01:05:59.008 --> 01:06:00.977
- When you play games, - A refund?

1630
01:06:01.177 --> 01:06:02.411
you need betting money.

1631
01:06:02.511 --> 01:06:03.879
- Did you get money exchanged? - Isn't it an exchange?

1632
01:06:03.879 --> 01:06:04.947
What did you say?

1633
01:06:04.947 --> 01:06:06.882
- My bad. - It's because of the Nevis Swing.

1634
01:06:07.083 --> 01:06:09.218
It's because of the Nevis Swing. Please understand.

1635
01:06:09.585 --> 01:06:12.955
(This is how much he's scared of it.)

1636
01:06:12.955 --> 01:06:14.724
Please make your final decisions.

1637
01:06:14.724 --> 01:06:16.025
He might not have gotten the presents,

1638
01:06:16.025 --> 01:06:17.493
but Seok Jin asked for it.

1639
01:06:17.493 --> 01:06:18.728
So Min knows that...

1640
01:06:18.728 --> 01:06:19.996
- I got it for sure. - There was nowhere to buy it.

1641
01:06:19.996 --> 01:06:22.732
- Did you get it yet? - No, I didn't.

1642
01:06:22.732 --> 01:06:24.500
It's whether he got the present or not.

1643
01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.435
This is your final decision. In one...

1644
01:06:26.435 --> 01:06:27.970
- No way. - She saw me getting it.

1645
01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:29.405
- Two, - No, I didn't.

1646
01:06:29.772 --> 01:06:30.806
three.

1647
01:06:31.507 --> 01:06:35.378
(Kwang Soo named what he got, so he sounds trustworthy.)

1648
01:06:35.378 --> 01:06:40.883
(So Min had a picture to prove her point.)

1649
01:06:41.183 --> 01:06:43.386
(Se Chan has the most penalty badges.)

1650
01:06:43.386 --> 01:06:46.188
(Jong Kook and So Min are closely after him.)

1651
01:06:46.455 --> 01:06:53.329
(This question decides what they'll be doing on the holiday.)

1652
01:06:53.729 --> 01:06:56.766
In 1, 2, 3.

1653
01:06:56.766 --> 01:06:57.967
(Which of the tiger moths will they trust?)

1654
01:06:57.967 --> 01:06:59.435
- I want to trust him. - I trust Kwang Soo.

1655
01:07:00.002 --> 01:07:01.570
- I pick Kwang Soo. - I trust him.

1656
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:03.439
(3 pick Kwang Soo, and 3 others pick So Min.)

1657
01:07:03.773 --> 01:07:05.107
(They are tied 3 to 3.)

1658
01:07:05.107 --> 01:07:06.642
All day...

1659
01:07:07.043 --> 01:07:09.445
I didn't trust him all day and now I do.

1660
01:07:09.979 --> 01:07:11.147
The thing is...

1661
01:07:11.147 --> 01:07:12.415
- It might not be something big, - I think he got it.

1662
01:07:12.415 --> 01:07:14.083
but he usually gets little things.

1663
01:07:14.417 --> 01:07:16.552
He usually doesn't get money exchanged.

1664
01:07:17.286 --> 01:07:18.854
He could have borrowed it.

1665
01:07:19.655 --> 01:07:22.725
So Kwang Soo gets a penalty badge.

1666
01:07:22.725 --> 01:07:25.161
(Kwang Soo gets another penalty badge.)

1667
01:07:25.161 --> 01:07:26.262
- Right. - It's 3 on 3.

1668
01:07:27.163 --> 01:07:28.631
There might be a twist to this story.

1669
01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:30.166
(If they tie, Kwang Soo gets a penalty badge.)

1670
01:07:30.166 --> 01:07:31.500
- Hold on. - We are safe now.

1671
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.735
So Min and I are safe now.

1672
01:07:32.735 --> 01:07:34.370
I lost this?

1673
01:07:34.537 --> 01:07:37.006
He ate it all. He bought and ate...

1674
01:07:37.006 --> 01:07:38.641
- all the snacks and chocolate. - Okay.

1675
01:07:38.641 --> 01:07:40.009
He ate it all.

1676
01:07:40.009 --> 01:07:41.177
(Their fates depend on who's telling the truth.)

1677
01:07:41.177 --> 01:07:42.812
The person...

1678
01:07:42.912 --> 01:07:45.781
who's lying will stand up...

1679
01:07:46.082 --> 01:07:47.917
- on my count of three. - The person who lied?

1680
01:07:48.417 --> 01:07:49.685
The person who lied?

1681
01:07:49.685 --> 01:07:51.854
- That person will stand up. - Okay.

1682
01:07:52.021 --> 01:07:53.556
- 1, - 1,

1683
01:07:53.556 --> 01:07:54.590
- 2... - 2...

1684
01:07:54.590 --> 01:07:56.525
(Se Chan, Seok Jin, and Jae Seok think he got the present.)

1685
01:07:56.892 --> 01:07:57.993
- 2, 3. - 2, 3.

1686
01:07:57.993 --> 01:07:59.261
(Jong Kook, Haha, and Ji Hyo believe So Min.)

1687
01:07:59.261 --> 01:08:01.030
(They think Kwang Soo didn't get the present.)

1688
01:08:01.497 --> 01:08:04.800
(Who's lying here?)

1689
01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:08.337
(Kwang Soo is lying.)

1690
01:08:08.337 --> 01:08:09.805
How can you lie to me about my present?

1691
01:08:09.805 --> 01:08:13.075
Are you human?

1692
01:08:13.075 --> 01:08:14.076
Sorry.

1693
01:08:14.076 --> 01:08:15.378
I said he didn't get it.

1694
01:08:15.611 --> 01:08:17.446
Why would I get presents when I went there for a penalty?

1695
01:08:17.913 --> 01:08:19.682
You should have said you didn't get it.

1696
01:08:19.682 --> 01:08:21.016
Why did you lie?

1697
01:08:21.517 --> 01:08:23.285
- Well... - What if I...

1698
01:08:23.352 --> 01:08:25.187
You know I didn't get once right?

1699
01:08:25.421 --> 01:08:26.956
I changed my mind at the end.

1700
01:08:26.956 --> 01:08:28.457
- You wanted me to trust you? - I'm sorry.

1701
01:08:28.457 --> 01:08:30.459
How can I trust you?

1702
01:08:30.459 --> 01:08:31.527
I'm sorry.

1703
01:08:31.527 --> 01:08:32.928
I think I know now.

1704
01:08:32.995 --> 01:08:34.163
Good job, So Min.

1705
01:08:34.697 --> 01:08:36.298
It depends on Se Chan's decision.

1706
01:08:36.298 --> 01:08:39.869
(The Tiger Moth Tour finally came to an end.)

1707
01:08:40.403 --> 01:08:42.805
All right. I'll tell you the final scores.

1708
01:08:42.838 --> 01:08:45.307
Se Chan has four penalty badges.

1709
01:08:45.307 --> 01:08:46.675
I didn't even get one right.

1710
01:08:46.842 --> 01:08:48.778
- How's that possible? - You're incredible.

1711
01:08:49.011 --> 01:08:50.513
He must be a shaman.

1712
01:08:50.746 --> 01:08:52.348
What is he saying?

1713
01:08:52.348 --> 01:08:53.749
(This is all because of you.)

1714
01:08:54.183 --> 01:08:56.218
So Min, Kwang Soo,

1715
01:08:56.218 --> 01:08:57.486
Jong Kook, Jae Seok,

1716
01:08:57.787 --> 01:08:59.255
and Seok Jin have two each.

1717
01:08:59.855 --> 01:09:03.025
For me, it's a big accomplishment to get half right,

1718
01:09:03.025 --> 01:09:05.094
but I can't believe I'm in crisis again.

1719
01:09:05.861 --> 01:09:08.130
(You should have trusted me.)

1720
01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:10.166
Ji Hyo and Haha...

1721
01:09:10.166 --> 01:09:11.934
are exempt from the penalty.

1722
01:09:11.934 --> 01:09:14.036
Enjoy your holidays.

1723
01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:15.471
I'll watch you guys on TV.

1724
01:09:15.471 --> 01:09:17.106
I'll watch you on TV.

1725
01:09:17.106 --> 01:09:19.575
Nevis Swing.

1726
01:09:21.143 --> 01:09:22.178
(It makes him tear up.)

1727
01:09:22.178 --> 01:09:23.512
Nevis Swing.

1728
01:09:23.746 --> 01:09:25.514
I'd rather work on a holiday.

1729
01:09:26.148 --> 01:09:27.683
Now,

1730
01:09:28.484 --> 01:09:30.453
- Se Chan... - Does he get to choose?

1731
01:09:30.786 --> 01:09:32.354
will choose one person.

1732
01:09:32.421 --> 01:09:35.658
I'll introduce the live broadcast you'll be doing on Chuseok.

1733
01:09:35.658 --> 01:09:36.826
- What is it? - What is it?

1734
01:09:36.826 --> 01:09:39.161
It's a water bomb penalty with the citizens.

1735
01:09:39.295 --> 01:09:40.696
What did you say? Water bomb?

1736
01:09:40.696 --> 01:09:41.931
(It's a water bomb penalty with the citizens.)

1737
01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:45.301
(Se Chan and another member will complete a mission.)

1738
01:09:45.301 --> 01:09:49.205
(The loser gets the water bomb.)

1739
01:09:49.205 --> 01:09:50.873
Depending on the viewer's pick,

1740
01:09:50.873 --> 01:09:53.576
one of you will be exempted and the other will get the water bomb.

1741
01:09:53.576 --> 01:09:54.577
It'll be live.

1742
01:09:54.577 --> 01:09:56.879
I'm fine with the water bomb,

1743
01:09:56.879 --> 01:09:58.481
but we have to go all the way there.

1744
01:09:59.114 --> 01:10:01.617
We have to leave early from home.

1745
01:10:01.617 --> 01:10:02.651
Right.

1746
01:10:02.918 --> 01:10:05.821
Cars make an endless line.

1747
01:10:06.589 --> 01:10:09.325
Highways around the country had traffic from the morning.

1748
01:10:09.358 --> 01:10:11.160
The congestion has been the worst.

1749
01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.161
(They must fight the traffic and get to the rest stop first.)

1750
01:10:12.394 --> 01:10:15.731
Se Chan is in last place.

1751
01:10:16.065 --> 01:10:17.533
This is so tiring.

1752
01:10:17.867 --> 01:10:19.134
I'm so tired.

1753
01:10:19.134 --> 01:10:20.536
To be honest, Se Chan.

1754
01:10:20.536 --> 01:10:23.105
I'm not lying about this.

1755
01:10:23.839 --> 01:10:26.008
I have to go on a trip from the 5th or the 6th.

1756
01:10:26.008 --> 01:10:29.945
- It's from the 5th to the 12th. - So what?

1757
01:10:30.212 --> 01:10:31.780
- That's what I mean. - So what?

1758
01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.916
What am I supposed to do about that?

1759
01:10:34.049 --> 01:10:35.851
Are you asking me...

1760
01:10:35.851 --> 01:10:37.953
- to refund your flight? - He can go another time.

1761
01:10:38.087 --> 01:10:39.088
What am I supposed to do?

1762
01:10:39.088 --> 01:10:41.257
That's what I was thinking. What are you supposed to do?

1763
01:10:41.423 --> 01:10:42.992
It's until the 12th.

1764
01:10:43.292 --> 01:10:44.727
Just keep it in mind.

1765
01:10:44.727 --> 01:10:45.761
(I'm away until the 12th, just to let you know.)

1766
01:10:45.928 --> 01:10:47.162
Let me say this one thing.

1767
01:10:47.596 --> 01:10:48.998
If you skip me,

1768
01:10:49.298 --> 01:10:51.934
I'll skip you too.

1769
01:10:52.601 --> 01:10:54.937
That doesn't bother me at all.

1770
01:10:54.937 --> 01:10:57.039
I already have the Nevis Swing, so what would I skip?

1771
01:10:57.373 --> 01:10:59.208
I have nothing to back off from.

1772
01:10:59.208 --> 01:11:00.543
I'm just going forward.

1773
01:11:00.543 --> 01:11:02.945
He has to go to Oceania anyways.

1774
01:11:02.945 --> 01:11:05.247
- I have to go. - You might provoke him even more.

1775
01:11:05.247 --> 01:11:06.615
Why are you provoking me?

1776
01:11:06.615 --> 01:11:08.117
I was just saying.

1777
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:09.785
What do you want me to do?

1778
01:11:10.719 --> 01:11:12.221
This is a coincidence,

1779
01:11:12.354 --> 01:11:14.423
but candidates for the penalty are sitting on one side,

1780
01:11:14.423 --> 01:11:15.658
and you two are sitting on the other side.

1781
01:11:15.658 --> 01:11:16.725
You're my sister from Mapo-gu.

1782
01:11:16.725 --> 01:11:17.726
I feel at ease.

1783
01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:20.996
Se Chan, stand behind...

1784
01:11:21.096 --> 01:11:23.165
and rip the name tag of the person you want to go with.

1785
01:11:23.365 --> 01:11:25.000
On October 18,

1786
01:11:26.268 --> 01:11:27.937
you two will go ahead with the penalty.

1787
01:11:27.937 --> 01:11:30.806
Ask who wants to volunteer.

1788
01:11:31.874 --> 01:11:33.475
Who wants to come with me?

1789
01:11:35.144 --> 01:11:36.712
Who wants to come with me?

1790
01:11:40.916 --> 01:11:42.785
(They're silent.)

1791
01:11:42.785 --> 01:11:44.587
- Goodness. - Look at all of you.

1792
01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.456
I see. Hold on.

1793
01:11:47.523 --> 01:11:49.091
- Hold on. - Wherever it may be.

1794
01:11:49.091 --> 01:11:51.060
- I'll go. - I was going to pass that person.

1795
01:11:51.226 --> 01:11:53.495
- I guess none of you want to come. - Wherever it may be.

1796
01:11:53.796 --> 01:11:54.997
I want to join you.

1797
01:11:54.997 --> 01:11:56.231
- By the way, - This is a mental game.

1798
01:11:56.231 --> 01:11:58.601
- I don't like what he's saying. - He's on my team.

1799
01:11:58.601 --> 01:11:59.635
He's on the Nevis team.

1800
01:11:59.635 --> 01:12:00.803
You have to think about this too.

1801
01:12:00.803 --> 01:12:04.840
Who do you think the viewers would like to see?

1802
01:12:05.841 --> 01:12:07.176
That's right.

1803
01:12:07.176 --> 01:12:08.944
He's a present to them.

1804
01:12:08.944 --> 01:12:10.946
He's a present himself.

1805
01:12:10.946 --> 01:12:12.982
Who do you think is the best in Running Man?

1806
01:12:14.817 --> 01:12:16.218
He's really a present.

1807
01:12:16.218 --> 01:12:18.187
- People will be so happy. - What are holidays for?

1808
01:12:18.187 --> 01:12:20.055
Who do you think can make people happy?

1809
01:12:20.055 --> 01:12:22.791
I'll exclude two people.

1810
01:12:23.892 --> 01:12:28.397
I'll exclude the Indonesian team.

1811
01:12:28.497 --> 01:12:30.666
- Thank you. - Why would you exclude them?

1812
01:12:30.666 --> 01:12:32.301
- Why would you do that? - I watched the video,

1813
01:12:32.301 --> 01:12:34.503
and they worked too hard. You know.

1814
01:12:34.603 --> 01:12:36.338
You have to admit that it was tough for them.

1815
01:12:36.338 --> 01:12:37.706
- Run towards me. - Yes.

1816
01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:40.943
Gosh.

1817
01:12:40.943 --> 01:12:43.212
(We'll watch the live broadcast at home.)

1818
01:12:43.712 --> 01:12:46.615
Please count down so that he can choose.

1819
01:12:46.615 --> 01:12:49.018
This is something good.

1820
01:12:49.018 --> 01:12:50.919
- Of course. - Please smile for me.

1821
01:12:50.919 --> 01:12:52.621
- From the sixth. - Show me your beautiful smiles.

1822
01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:54.223
We know how to smile.

1823
01:12:54.223 --> 01:12:56.025
I have a nice smile.

1824
01:12:56.025 --> 01:12:57.926
- Show me your beautiful smiles. - From the 6th to the 12th...

1825
01:12:57.926 --> 01:12:59.294
I get it. So what?

1826
01:12:59.294 --> 01:13:01.096
Why are you telling me that?

1827
01:13:01.163 --> 01:13:02.798
I'm Smile Kim.

1828
01:13:02.798 --> 01:13:04.233
Five.

1829
01:13:04.233 --> 01:13:05.768
- No way. - It's coming.

1830
01:13:05.768 --> 01:13:07.102
- Three, - Jae Seok.

1831
01:13:07.102 --> 01:13:08.704
two...

1832
01:13:09.371 --> 01:13:10.406
Make up your mind.

1833
01:13:10.773 --> 01:13:13.375
What is Se Chan's decision?

1834
01:13:13.776 --> 01:13:15.210
- Hurry up. - Everybody,

1835
01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:16.445
who would you like to see?

1836
01:13:16.445 --> 01:13:18.947
- Se Chan. - Who is it?

1837
01:13:19.181 --> 01:13:22.117
Is it Jong Kook or Seok Jin?

1838
01:13:22.685 --> 01:13:24.586
It's...

1839
01:13:26.422 --> 01:13:29.324
(Is it Jong Kook?)

1840
01:13:29.324 --> 01:13:32.494
(Is it Seok Jin who has a trip planned?)

1841
01:13:32.494 --> 01:13:37.299
(Is it Jae Seok who's the best emcee out there?)

1842
01:13:37.299 --> 01:13:38.400
Jae Seok.

1843
01:13:38.667 --> 01:13:39.668
It's Jae Seok.

1844
01:13:39.668 --> 01:13:44.073
(Jae Seok will be joining him for the live broadcast.)

1845
01:13:45.107 --> 01:13:48.510
(Se Chan and Jae Seok will be broadcasting on Chuseok.)

1846
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:50.345
Everybody wanted to see him, right?

1847
01:13:50.612 --> 01:13:54.583
(We'll be watching from home as well.)

1848
01:13:55.751 --> 01:13:57.686
It's Korea's best emcee, Yu Jae Seok.

1849
01:13:57.986 --> 01:13:59.321
We'll see you at the rest stop.

1850
01:14:01.123 --> 01:14:02.758
Good job, Se Chan.

1851
01:14:02.758 --> 01:14:04.560
- I listened to Jong Kook. - It's a present.

1852
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.295
It's a present for the people.

1853
01:14:06.495 --> 01:14:09.331
- That's right. - Jong Kook was convincing.

1854
01:14:09.331 --> 01:14:10.999
I was convincing.

1855
01:14:10.999 --> 01:14:13.902
People will be so happy. They'll be so thankful.

1856
01:14:13.902 --> 01:14:15.137
Good job, Se Chan.

1857
01:14:15.304 --> 01:14:17.339
Bring your car, and pick me up.

1858
01:14:17.339 --> 01:14:19.842
Of course. I'll pick you up.

1859
01:14:20.008 --> 01:14:21.043
All right.

1860
01:14:21.043 --> 01:14:22.811
(He tries to calm down.)

1861
01:14:22.811 --> 01:14:24.213
- On the 8th... - Are you all right?

1862
01:14:24.213 --> 01:14:25.681
(Are you all right?)

1863
01:14:25.681 --> 01:14:27.216
- Are you all right? - He's not happy.

1864
01:14:27.216 --> 01:14:29.418
- Jae Seok. - Please smile, Jae Seok.

1865
01:14:29.418 --> 01:14:30.953
- Please. - He's not happy.

1866
01:14:31.153 --> 01:14:32.788
You should spend some time with him.

1867
01:14:32.788 --> 01:14:34.123
- I will. - Sure.

1868
01:14:34.123 --> 01:14:37.292
After this, the live broadcast will continue.

1869
01:14:37.292 --> 01:14:39.495
- We'll follow it. - Please smile.

1870
01:14:39.795 --> 01:14:40.896
"At the scene..."

1871
01:14:40.896 --> 01:14:41.964
(That's what they say on live broadcasts.)

1872
01:14:42.798 --> 01:14:43.866
You and I...

1873
01:14:43.866 --> 01:14:45.567
Reporter Yu Jae Seok.

1874
01:14:45.601 --> 01:14:48.403
You can call yourself.

1875
01:14:48.403 --> 01:14:50.139
Let's get to the scene.

1876
01:14:50.572 --> 01:14:51.573
I'll be there.

1877
01:14:51.573 --> 01:14:53.942
(Yes, I'll be there.)

1878
01:14:53.942 --> 01:14:56.311
(As the top emcee, he starts the broadcast right away.)

1879
01:14:56.311 --> 01:14:57.679
Yes, I'll be there.

1880
01:14:57.679 --> 01:14:59.815
Let's get it. Okay.

1881
01:14:59.815 --> 01:15:00.816
I'll be there.

1882
01:15:00.816 --> 01:15:03.786
(Jae Seok and Se Chan's Chuseok live broadcast starts now.)

1883
01:15:11.393 --> 01:15:15.297
(Deokpyeong Rest Stop, Icheon)

1884
01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:28.043
(Yu Jae Seok, Yang Se Chan)

1885
01:15:28.043 --> 01:15:30.312
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello.

1886
01:15:30.312 --> 01:15:31.613
Hello, I'm Yang Se Chan.

1887
01:15:32.014 --> 01:15:33.015
Nice to meet you.

1888
01:15:34.016 --> 01:15:35.517
Finally,

1889
01:15:35.517 --> 01:15:38.353
- as you see, it's Chuseok. - You're right.

1890
01:15:38.353 --> 01:15:40.122
There's not much of it left,

1891
01:15:40.122 --> 01:15:42.524
but Se Chan and I...

1892
01:15:42.591 --> 01:15:45.661
- are here with many guests. - That's right.

1893
01:15:45.661 --> 01:15:48.463
We're doing a live broadcast at the rest stop.

1894
01:15:48.497 --> 01:15:50.065
It's a penalty.

1895
01:15:50.065 --> 01:15:52.134
That's right. Today finally came.

1896
01:15:52.134 --> 01:15:54.036
- Of course. - I didn't think it would come.

1897
01:15:54.036 --> 01:15:55.938
I thought about this.

1898
01:15:55.938 --> 01:15:59.775
Do we have to do the penalty on live broadcast?

1899
01:15:59.975 --> 01:16:02.144
Anyway, I'm here now.

1900
01:16:02.144 --> 01:16:04.880
We're here, and so many people are cheering for us.

1901
01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.782
- Isn't it great? - I'm so happy...

1902
01:16:06.782 --> 01:16:09.518
- that they are welcoming us. - So many people are here.

1903
01:16:09.518 --> 01:16:10.485
I'm so happy.

1904
01:16:10.485 --> 01:16:12.187
Did you enjoy the Chuseok holidays?

1905
01:16:12.187 --> 01:16:14.723
Se Hyung and I went to Dongducheon.

1906
01:16:14.723 --> 01:16:17.793
- I guess you met your friends. - Yes, we had many meatballs.

1907
01:16:17.793 --> 01:16:22.030
I heard Se Hyung was catching up with his friends...

1908
01:16:22.164 --> 01:16:24.399
and woke up at 5pm the next day.

1909
01:16:24.399 --> 01:16:25.734
Yes, he got a hangover.

1910
01:16:25.901 --> 01:16:27.803
- He's still bedridden. - I see.

1911
01:16:27.803 --> 01:16:32.274
Anyhow, Se Chan and I are at this rest stop...

1912
01:16:32.274 --> 01:16:35.677
doing a live broadcast. We have around 14 minutes left.

1913
01:16:35.677 --> 01:16:37.713
- Time flies. - I hope that...

1914
01:16:37.713 --> 01:16:40.182
we finish off nicely without making any mistakes.

1915
01:16:40.182 --> 01:16:41.516
- We'll get the penalty... - That's right.

1916
01:16:41.516 --> 01:16:43.852
and return home.

1917
01:16:43.886 --> 01:16:46.355
We still have tomorrow left of the holidays,

1918
01:16:46.355 --> 01:16:49.591
so please join Running Man during your long weekend.

1919
01:16:49.591 --> 01:16:51.293
I hope that you enjoy the rest of it.

1920
01:16:51.293 --> 01:16:54.129
Can you explain the rules to us?

1921
01:16:54.129 --> 01:16:55.964
- Should I explain it? - Should I?

1922
01:16:55.964 --> 01:16:57.499
- Yes. - I'll do it.

1923
01:16:57.499 --> 01:16:59.167
You're good at this.

1924
01:16:59.167 --> 01:17:01.503
I'll say it then. It's simple.

1925
01:17:01.503 --> 01:17:03.805
Today, we came here early...

1926
01:17:03.906 --> 01:17:07.442
and recruited three people per team.

1927
01:17:07.509 --> 01:17:09.244
We divided them up into Team Jae Seok and Team Se Chan.

1928
01:17:09.411 --> 01:17:12.447
We'll play three rounds.

1929
01:17:12.514 --> 01:17:14.349
There are four rounds in total.

1930
01:17:14.349 --> 01:17:17.920
We'll play four rounds. You see the roulette there?

1931
01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.923
- Yes, I do. - Whenever you lose,

1932
01:17:20.923 --> 01:17:22.858
- The name tags. - we'll put our names on it.

1933
01:17:22.858 --> 01:17:25.594
We'll spin the roulette at the end,

1934
01:17:26.194 --> 01:17:28.397
and if it stops on my name, I'll take the water bomb.

1935
01:17:28.597 --> 01:17:32.134
If it stops on your name, you'll get the water bomb.

1936
01:17:32.134 --> 01:17:34.503
If it lands on both of us, we'll both get it.

1937
01:17:34.503 --> 01:17:36.805
We'll both get the water bomb.

1938
01:17:36.805 --> 01:17:39.308
This is live, so we can't fake it.

1939
01:17:39.308 --> 01:17:40.976
We have to speak quickly...

1940
01:17:40.976 --> 01:17:42.911
because we have to finish in 15 minutes.

1941
01:17:42.911 --> 01:17:44.413
We have 13 minutes left.

1942
01:17:44.413 --> 01:17:48.583
We'll get started with the games for the live broadcast.

1943
01:17:48.583 --> 01:17:51.420
- Let's go. - Let's get started with round one.

1944
01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:54.589
The first game...

1945
01:17:54.623 --> 01:17:57.025
is something our viewers would have wanted to try.

1946
01:17:57.025 --> 01:17:58.694
- Many people would have. - It's Pirate Roulette.

1947
01:17:58.694 --> 01:18:00.195
Here it is.

1948
01:18:00.195 --> 01:18:02.698
Kwang Soo, Seok Jin,

1949
01:18:02.698 --> 01:18:04.666
- and I... You are one of us too. - Kind of.

1950
01:18:04.666 --> 01:18:07.035
- We are unlucky. - You are unlucky.

1951
01:18:07.035 --> 01:18:09.972
Our producer is rushing us.

1952
01:18:09.972 --> 01:18:12.474
Why did you set up a live broadcast then?

1953
01:18:12.607 --> 01:18:14.910
- You should have filmed it. - Let's get to the point.

1954
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:16.878
- All right. - Shall we play?

1955
01:18:16.878 --> 01:18:18.347
He wants to get to the point.

1956
01:18:18.347 --> 01:18:20.716
Once I start talking, I can't stop.

1957
01:18:20.716 --> 01:18:21.917
Please interrupt me.

1958
01:18:21.917 --> 01:18:24.319
Here's round one. The game is,

1959
01:18:24.319 --> 01:18:26.188
as I have mentioned, it's Pirate Roulette.

1960
01:18:26.188 --> 01:18:28.757
Let me take one person from each team.

1961
01:18:28.757 --> 01:18:30.892
- Please come up. - It's Mr. Jung Bong Jun...

1962
01:18:30.892 --> 01:18:33.028
and Mr. Um Ki Young.

1963
01:18:33.028 --> 01:18:34.429
- Please come up. - Let's welcome them.

1964
01:18:34.429 --> 01:18:35.430
Please.

1965
01:18:35.764 --> 01:18:37.566
Nice to meet you. Hello.

1966
01:18:37.566 --> 01:18:38.800
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1967
01:18:38.934 --> 01:18:41.870
Let's conduct a short interview.

1968
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:44.506
Did you have a good holiday?

1969
01:18:44.506 --> 01:18:45.874
Where are you coming back from?

1970
01:18:46.008 --> 01:18:47.275
I went to Jecheon.

1971
01:18:47.275 --> 01:18:48.777
What were you doing there?

1972
01:18:48.777 --> 01:18:50.212
I went with my friends.

1973
01:18:50.245 --> 01:18:52.347
This is live, so you must be nervous.

1974
01:18:52.347 --> 01:18:53.915
Yes, a little bit.

1975
01:18:53.915 --> 01:18:57.786
You're joining us for the penalty today.

1976
01:18:57.786 --> 01:18:59.688
You'll be playing this game. How are you usually?

1977
01:18:59.688 --> 01:19:03.925
Are you lucky or unlucky like us?

1978
01:19:03.959 --> 01:19:04.960
I'm unlucky.

1979
01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:07.496
You chose the wrong person.

1980
01:19:07.596 --> 01:19:09.297
- I have to win. - Let me ask.

1981
01:19:09.297 --> 01:19:10.665
- Please introduce yourself. - How about you, Ki Young?

1982
01:19:10.866 --> 01:19:13.101
I'm Um Ki Young from Suwon. I'm 37 years old.

1983
01:19:13.101 --> 01:19:14.970
Do you usually get lucky?

1984
01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:16.171
I get really lucky.

1985
01:19:16.171 --> 01:19:18.407
- Really? - Where are you returning from?

1986
01:19:18.407 --> 01:19:20.575
- I was in Daegu. - I see.

1987
01:19:21.143 --> 01:19:23.178
- So you are lucky, right? - Yes.

1988
01:19:23.245 --> 01:19:25.213
- All right. - We would love to...

1989
01:19:25.213 --> 01:19:28.617
conduct longer interviews.

1990
01:19:28.617 --> 01:19:31.186
- But we have no time. - We have no time,

1991
01:19:31.253 --> 01:19:35.323
so we'll get started with round one right away.

1992
01:19:35.323 --> 01:19:38.093
You're unlucky like me,

1993
01:19:38.093 --> 01:19:39.961
- but I trust you this time. - Let's get it.

1994
01:19:39.961 --> 01:19:42.664
- Please come forward, Bong Jun. - Please come forward, Ki Young.

1995
01:19:42.931 --> 01:19:45.500
Please do rock-paper-scissors.

1996
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.235
- The winner... - The winner will go first.

1997
01:19:47.602 --> 01:19:49.438
You can choose.

1998
01:19:49.438 --> 01:19:50.505
Please do rock-paper-scissors.

1999
01:19:50.505 --> 01:19:51.873
Rock-paper-scissors

2000
01:19:51.873 --> 01:19:53.241
- He won. - You won.

2001
01:19:53.241 --> 01:19:54.276
He can go first.

2002
01:19:54.276 --> 01:19:55.277
Good job.

2003
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:57.012
It won't pop up from the beginning, right?

2004
01:19:57.012 --> 01:19:58.046
That'll be fun.

2005
01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.415
Okay... What?

2006
01:20:00.682 --> 01:20:02.617
Everybody.

2007
01:20:02.617 --> 01:20:04.519
(Team Se Chan wins.)

2008
01:20:04.519 --> 01:20:06.421
Everybody, this is live broadcast.

2009
01:20:06.421 --> 01:20:07.823
This wasn't made up.

2010
01:20:08.123 --> 01:20:10.492
Bong Jun, you are so unlucky.

2011
01:20:10.492 --> 01:20:12.160
You're so unlucky.

2012
01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.496
- Ki Young didn't even do anything. - I know...

2013
01:20:14.496 --> 01:20:16.298
I'm unlucky but not this much.

2014
01:20:16.298 --> 01:20:18.266
You're Kwang Soo's level.

2015
01:20:18.767 --> 01:20:21.703
- I just got goosebumps. - Me too.

2016
01:20:21.703 --> 01:20:24.139
Ki Young didn't even go.

2017
01:20:24.306 --> 01:20:25.407
Round one is over.

2018
01:20:25.407 --> 01:20:27.676
That was too short.

2019
01:20:27.676 --> 01:20:28.844
You're in disbelief.

2020
01:20:29.111 --> 01:20:31.046
How do you feel?

2021
01:20:31.313 --> 01:20:32.314
I'm happy.

2022
01:20:32.948 --> 01:20:33.982
You're happy?

2023
01:20:34.216 --> 01:20:35.984
- Really? - I'm so unhappy right now.

2024
01:20:36.251 --> 01:20:38.687
- How can you do that in 1 try? - He lost in 1 try.

2025
01:20:38.687 --> 01:20:41.056
- So round one, - I won.

2026
01:20:41.056 --> 01:20:44.192
I lost. Thank you, Bong Jun and Ki Young.

2027
01:20:44.192 --> 01:20:45.994
- Thank you. - Thank you. Please have a seat.

2028
01:20:45.994 --> 01:20:47.829
I'll stick on your name tag.

2029
01:20:47.829 --> 01:20:49.297
I'm so...

2030
01:20:49.698 --> 01:20:50.665
Thank you.

2031
01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.168
During the holidays...

2032
01:20:54.402 --> 01:20:55.670
You're supposed to stick mine up.

2033
01:20:55.670 --> 01:20:57.772
- That was close. - This is live,

2034
01:20:57.772 --> 01:20:59.474
so it's...

2035
01:21:00.075 --> 01:21:01.710
a small glitch.

2036
01:21:01.877 --> 01:21:03.311
You can put it anywhere.

2037
01:21:04.813 --> 01:21:05.814
Sure.

2038
01:21:06.615 --> 01:21:08.717
I was so flustered...

2039
01:21:08.717 --> 01:21:11.286
on live television.

2040
01:21:11.453 --> 01:21:14.523
As soon as Bong Jun said that he's unlucky...

2041
01:21:14.523 --> 01:21:16.358
- As soon as he said it. - As soon as he played,

2042
01:21:16.391 --> 01:21:18.126
- the pirate popped up. - Right.

2043
01:21:18.126 --> 01:21:20.095
This could have been made up.

2044
01:21:20.095 --> 01:21:22.030
I was so flustered that I almost stuck my name up.

2045
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:24.566
Bong Jun had no idea.

2046
01:21:24.566 --> 01:21:27.169
I find something else really strange.

2047
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:29.204
Bong Jun looks too happy.

2048
01:21:29.204 --> 01:21:30.205
He looks so composed.

2049
01:21:30.205 --> 01:21:31.806
He thinks he did something grand.

2050
01:21:31.806 --> 01:21:34.242
He forgot that he's on my team.

2051
01:21:34.242 --> 01:21:36.144
Ki Young didn't do anything. I feel bad for him.

2052
01:21:36.144 --> 01:21:38.313
That's right. He only introduced himself.

2053
01:21:38.346 --> 01:21:41.016
He merely said he's from Suwon.

2054
01:21:41.049 --> 01:21:42.684
He didn't do anything, and he's back in his seat.

2055
01:21:42.684 --> 01:21:44.519
- Thank you, Ki Young. - Thank you.

2056
01:21:44.519 --> 01:21:47.289
Let's get started with round two.

2057
01:21:47.289 --> 01:21:51.693
This is live so we must hurry. Please understand.

2058
01:21:51.693 --> 01:21:54.696
Round two is another roulette game we played a lot.

2059
01:21:54.696 --> 01:21:55.897
We did.

2060
01:21:55.931 --> 01:21:57.766
- It's Water Gun Roulette. - Let's go.

2061
01:21:57.766 --> 01:21:58.967
Let's invite our guests.

2062
01:21:58.967 --> 01:22:02.003
It's Ms. Kim Min Soo and Mr. Cho Seung Hoon.

2063
01:22:02.003 --> 01:22:03.672
- Hello. - Hello.

2064
01:22:03.905 --> 01:22:05.440
- I'm... - Sorry?

2065
01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.809
I'm Kim Min Soo, and I'm a mom with two kids.

2066
01:22:07.809 --> 01:22:10.178
- She's Kim Min Soo. - Please introduce yourself.

2067
01:22:10.178 --> 01:22:12.514
I'm Cho Seung Hoon from Suwon. I'm 33 years old.

2068
01:22:12.514 --> 01:22:13.815
He's Seung Hoon.

2069
01:22:13.815 --> 01:22:15.650
I heard that...

2070
01:22:15.717 --> 01:22:17.419
you are a married couple.

2071
01:22:17.419 --> 01:22:18.453
- Is that right? - Yes.

2072
01:22:18.587 --> 01:22:20.922
One of you are on my team, and the other is on Se Chan's team.

2073
01:22:20.922 --> 01:22:22.824
- You're separated. Is that okay? - It's okay.

2074
01:22:23.425 --> 01:22:24.926
- Is it okay? - Yes, it is.

2075
01:22:24.926 --> 01:22:26.695
Are you okay too, Min Soo?

2076
01:22:26.695 --> 01:22:28.263
- Yes, I am. - I see.

2077
01:22:28.296 --> 01:22:31.466
We separated the team. I'm sure you saw earlier.

2078
01:22:31.466 --> 01:22:33.335
During the first round,

2079
01:22:33.335 --> 01:22:36.371
our team lost.

2080
01:22:36.371 --> 01:22:38.206
We need for you to win.

2081
01:22:38.206 --> 01:22:39.241
Okay.

2082
01:22:39.241 --> 01:22:41.443
Are you good with games? Are you usually lucky?

2083
01:22:41.843 --> 01:22:42.978
Yes, I am.

2084
01:22:43.311 --> 01:22:45.180
- That's great. What about you? - I'm relieved.

2085
01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:47.249
- I'm usually unlucky. - He...

2086
01:22:47.249 --> 01:22:48.750
- Are you really? - He has bad luck.

2087
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:49.951
Thank goodness.

2088
01:22:49.951 --> 01:22:52.754
We need to win this time...

2089
01:22:52.754 --> 01:22:54.122
for the game...

2090
01:22:54.122 --> 01:22:55.423
- to become neck and neck. - That's right.

2091
01:22:55.423 --> 01:22:57.592
How has your Chuseok holiday been so far?

2092
01:22:57.892 --> 01:23:00.061
My family... Our family...

2093
01:23:00.061 --> 01:23:01.263
went on a trip.

2094
01:23:01.263 --> 01:23:02.497
- A trip? - Where did you go?

2095
01:23:02.497 --> 01:23:04.299
- The east coast. - That's so nice.

2096
01:23:04.432 --> 01:23:06.101
How was the trip?

2097
01:23:06.201 --> 01:23:07.335
- It was fun. - Was it?

2098
01:23:07.335 --> 01:23:08.503
Were you driving the whole time?

2099
01:23:08.503 --> 01:23:10.205
No, my wife...

2100
01:23:10.205 --> 01:23:12.374
took turns with me. It was a relaxing trip.

2101
01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:15.410
Were there any funny happenings on the trip?

2102
01:23:16.244 --> 01:23:18.847
It was my first time seeing the sunrise.

2103
01:23:19.381 --> 01:23:20.448
It was very meaningful for me.

2104
01:23:20.448 --> 01:23:21.616
- Wish. - When you saw it,

2105
01:23:21.616 --> 01:23:23.451
- did you make a wish? - Yes.

2106
01:23:23.451 --> 01:23:24.519
What did you wish for?

2107
01:23:24.653 --> 01:23:26.054
For my family to have luck.

2108
01:23:26.821 --> 01:23:27.889
- What about you? - What about you?

2109
01:23:27.889 --> 01:23:30.392
- I was sleeping then. - You were sleeping.

2110
01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.028
Did you only sleep?

2111
01:23:33.028 --> 01:23:34.562
- I slept in. - You shouldn't say that.

2112
01:23:35.196 --> 01:23:36.665
This can't be aired.

2113
01:23:36.665 --> 01:23:37.999
She just told me something.

2114
01:23:37.999 --> 01:23:40.302
Did she say something? Is she mad about him sleeping?

2115
01:23:40.302 --> 01:23:42.337
- I can't say it since we're live. - You can't.

2116
01:23:42.337 --> 01:23:44.172
I would say it if we're recording since we can edit it out.

2117
01:23:44.172 --> 01:23:46.908
However, I can't say this. She was so mad...

2118
01:23:46.908 --> 01:23:49.110
- that she told me something. - She was mad.

2119
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:51.579
I'll tell you what she said after the live show finishes.

2120
01:23:51.646 --> 01:23:53.581
Do you have any idea what she might have said?

2121
01:23:53.782 --> 01:23:55.817
- I'm not sure. - No?

2122
01:23:55.817 --> 01:23:57.719
- You'll be shocked. - Shocked?

2123
01:23:57.719 --> 01:24:00.822
Since we're live, we'll hurry and move on.

2124
01:24:00.822 --> 01:24:03.158
- Water gun. - If you keep rolling that,

2125
01:24:03.158 --> 01:24:04.859
you might accidentally roll forward...

2126
01:24:04.859 --> 01:24:07.796
since it's their first live show. Please be very careful.

2127
01:24:07.796 --> 01:24:09.464
Anyway...

2128
01:24:09.464 --> 01:24:11.499
Anyway, the live show continues.

2129
01:24:11.499 --> 01:24:13.535
First round of penalties.

2130
01:24:14.302 --> 01:24:15.437
They're a married couple.

2131
01:24:15.704 --> 01:24:17.872
One water gun has water in it...

2132
01:24:17.872 --> 01:24:19.708
- while the other doesn't. - No.

2133
01:24:19.808 --> 01:24:21.876
You must choose 1 on the count of 3,

2134
01:24:22.077 --> 01:24:24.612
then shoot toward your opponent.

2135
01:24:24.612 --> 01:24:25.647
Toward the face.

2136
01:24:25.647 --> 01:24:27.749
- Will that be all right? - Yes, it's fine.

2137
01:24:27.749 --> 01:24:29.317
- Are you okay with it? - Yes, I'm fine.

2138
01:24:29.317 --> 01:24:31.486
- Great. - They're so into it that...

2139
01:24:31.586 --> 01:24:33.655
- we question their marriage. - You're right.

2140
01:24:33.655 --> 01:24:35.256
- They're so focused. - They're focused.

2141
01:24:35.256 --> 01:24:37.325
- Okay, move up. - Please move up.

2142
01:24:37.325 --> 01:24:39.594
We'll now start the Water Gun Roulette.

2143
01:24:39.594 --> 01:24:41.996
You can choose the one you want.

2144
01:24:41.996 --> 01:24:43.598
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2145
01:24:43.598 --> 01:24:45.100
Rock-paper-scissors

2146
01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.468
Okay, Seung Hoon.

2147
01:24:47.168 --> 01:24:48.303
Are you sure it's that one?

2148
01:24:48.536 --> 01:24:49.604
Okay.

2149
01:24:49.637 --> 01:24:50.972
Min Soo.

2150
01:24:51.039 --> 01:24:52.907
Please be careful with what you mouth.

2151
01:24:53.074 --> 01:24:55.176
- All right. - Min Soo.

2152
01:24:55.176 --> 01:24:56.611
Point it towards your opponent.

2153
01:24:56.611 --> 01:24:58.046
- Don't shoot it yet. - Not yet.

2154
01:24:58.079 --> 01:25:00.115
- Now... - Aim it towards the face.

2155
01:25:00.115 --> 01:25:01.416
- Towards the face. - Yes.

2156
01:25:01.416 --> 01:25:02.984
One. Towards the face.

2157
01:25:03.218 --> 01:25:05.553
1, 2, 3. Shoot.

2158
01:25:05.553 --> 01:25:07.789
Okay! Hold on.

2159
01:25:07.789 --> 01:25:09.657
- Stop. - Stop shooting.

2160
01:25:09.657 --> 01:25:11.493
- She's really mad. - She's your wife.

2161
01:25:11.493 --> 01:25:12.594
Are you all right?

2162
01:25:13.795 --> 01:25:15.230
She's so mad.

2163
01:25:15.597 --> 01:25:16.898
We lost again.

2164
01:25:16.898 --> 01:25:18.800
- In the middle... - I'm going crazy.

2165
01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:20.135
I thought you were lucky.

2166
01:25:20.135 --> 01:25:21.669
I guess I'm not.

2167
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:23.505
What I'm worried about...

2168
01:25:23.638 --> 01:25:25.907
- is that they'd fight. - They might fight.

2169
01:25:25.907 --> 01:25:27.175
You shouldn't do that.

2170
01:25:27.175 --> 01:25:29.677
Are you all right? There's a lot of water. Sorry.

2171
01:25:29.677 --> 01:25:32.480
- With that, Se Chan won again. - This round too.

2172
01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.282
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

2173
01:25:34.282 --> 01:25:36.351
Min Soo, are you okay? We don't have any towels.

2174
01:25:36.785 --> 01:25:38.119
It's my name again.

2175
01:25:39.087 --> 01:25:41.289
Why are we doing this?

2176
01:25:41.289 --> 01:25:42.791
It's just my name on the roulette.

2177
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:45.460
We only have about five minutes

2178
01:25:45.493 --> 01:25:47.762
- You have to stick it on faster. - All right.

2179
01:25:47.762 --> 01:25:48.963
Se Chan.

2180
01:25:48.963 --> 01:25:51.466
We have to proceed the third round...

2181
01:25:51.466 --> 01:25:54.135
- within 2 minutes and 30 seconds. - It's your turn.

2182
01:25:54.135 --> 01:25:56.137
Let's invite Hyun Jung and Gyu Ri up.

2183
01:25:56.137 --> 01:25:58.606
- Come on up! - What is the next game?

2184
01:25:58.606 --> 01:26:00.775
- This will be our last game. - Yes.

2185
01:26:01.009 --> 01:26:04.179
- It's Egg Roulette! - Egg war!

2186
01:26:04.179 --> 01:26:05.814
It's Egg Roulette.

2187
01:26:05.814 --> 01:26:07.382
One will be boiled...

2188
01:26:07.382 --> 01:26:09.384
- while the other will be raw. - It's raw.

2189
01:26:09.384 --> 01:26:11.219
The two of you will strike...

2190
01:26:11.219 --> 01:26:13.321
the eggs on our heads as hard as you can.

2191
01:26:13.388 --> 01:26:15.256
The one with the raw egg loses.

2192
01:26:15.256 --> 01:26:16.858
- We'll put on the name sticker. - That's right!

2193
01:26:16.858 --> 01:26:18.460
How will the last round go?

2194
01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.928
Hyun Jung,

2195
01:26:19.928 --> 01:26:22.230
this is a live show. Are you nervous?

2196
01:26:22.664 --> 01:26:24.065
I'm really nervous.

2197
01:26:24.599 --> 01:26:26.067
- Are you all right? - Yes.

2198
01:26:26.067 --> 01:26:27.168
Where are you coming from?

2199
01:26:27.168 --> 01:26:29.671
We went to visit my grandpa's grave.

2200
01:26:29.671 --> 01:26:32.540
You saw how hard our teammates played,

2201
01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.409
but we're losing. I really want you to win.

2202
01:26:34.409 --> 01:26:35.944
Gyu Ri, please introduce yourself.

2203
01:26:35.944 --> 01:26:38.746
Hello, I'm Kim Gyu Ri from Incheon. I'm 20 years old.

2204
01:26:38.746 --> 01:26:41.082
Gyu Ri, are you the lucky type?

2205
01:26:41.216 --> 01:26:43.051
- No. - You're not?

2206
01:26:43.051 --> 01:26:44.919
She's not. Gyu Ri,

2207
01:26:44.953 --> 01:26:46.955
I heard that you're a fan of Yang Se Hyung.

2208
01:26:46.955 --> 01:26:48.523
Yes, I'm his fan.

2209
01:26:48.523 --> 01:26:49.724
- Really? - You're in front of Se Chan.

2210
01:26:49.724 --> 01:26:51.259
- He's Se Hyung's brother. - What do you think?

2211
01:26:51.259 --> 01:26:52.393
Do you prefer my brother?

2212
01:26:53.127 --> 01:26:54.128
Pardon?

2213
01:26:54.128 --> 01:26:55.330
All right, all right.

2214
01:26:55.330 --> 01:26:57.999
We don't have time, so we won't interrogate.

2215
01:26:57.999 --> 01:26:59.400
- Please don't. - All right.

2216
01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.803
Hyun Jung and Gyu Ri, please step forward.

2217
01:27:01.803 --> 01:27:03.705
- Should we prepare ourselves? - All right.

2218
01:27:04.105 --> 01:27:05.807
Yes, let's get started right away.

2219
01:27:05.807 --> 01:27:07.542
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Hyun Jung and Gyu Ri,

2220
01:27:07.542 --> 01:27:08.943
you don't have to be nice to us.

2221
01:27:08.943 --> 01:27:11.746
Just strike us as hard as you can. Rock-paper-scissors

2222
01:27:11.746 --> 01:27:13.147
- We keep on winning. - Please pick one first.

2223
01:27:13.147 --> 01:27:15.250
- Great. - You too, Hyun Jung.

2224
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:17.318
- Let's go. - Only one is boiled.

2225
01:27:17.418 --> 01:27:20.655
Hit us on our foreheads. 1, 2, 3!

2226
01:27:23.892 --> 01:27:24.926
Great.

2227
01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:26.594
Thank you, Hyun Jung.

2228
01:27:26.594 --> 01:27:28.263
- I lost. - Put it down here.

2229
01:27:28.263 --> 01:27:29.564
- It's fine. - Are you all right?

2230
01:27:29.564 --> 01:27:31.599
- Go wipe your hand. - You can wipe it over there.

2231
01:27:31.799 --> 01:27:32.901
Thank you.

2232
01:27:33.201 --> 01:27:34.602
I lost this time.

2233
01:27:35.169 --> 01:27:37.205
Since I lost, we have to put up my name.

2234
01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.009
Did we use that again this time?

2235
01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:42.210
Great.

2236
01:27:42.210 --> 01:27:43.878
Thanks to Hyun Jung, I won.

2237
01:27:43.878 --> 01:27:45.680
- Now, we don't have time. - Time...

2238
01:27:46.014 --> 01:27:47.715
It'll be our last round.

2239
01:27:47.815 --> 01:27:50.151
Se Chan and I will play rock-paper-scissors...

2240
01:27:50.451 --> 01:27:52.220
to stick on the last two names.

2241
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.254
Let's go.

2242
01:27:53.254 --> 01:27:54.255
Yes. You and me.

2243
01:27:54.255 --> 01:27:55.723
- One against one? - A single-round match.

2244
01:27:55.723 --> 01:27:57.458
- Okay, rock-paper-scissors - Scissors

2245
01:27:57.525 --> 01:27:59.093
- Rock-paper-scissors - I won!

2246
01:27:59.394 --> 01:28:00.461
Okay!

2247
01:28:00.795 --> 01:28:02.797
(Se Chan wins!)

2248
01:28:02.797 --> 01:28:04.499
This is driving me crazy.

2249
01:28:04.699 --> 01:28:07.402
Okay, we don't have much time. I'm so sorry.

2250
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:10.338
If you see us rushing on the screen,

2251
01:28:10.371 --> 01:28:11.906
you would feel anxious too.

2252
01:28:11.906 --> 01:28:14.075
- However, it can't be helped. - I'm putting on two, right?

2253
01:28:14.075 --> 01:28:15.243
Last 1. Yes, 2.

2254
01:28:15.243 --> 01:28:16.744
Min Ki, please come up.

2256
01:28:19.581 --> 01:28:20.915
- This is the last bit. - It's the final.

2257
01:28:20.915 --> 01:28:22.617
Thank you for waiting, Min Ki.

2258
01:28:22.617 --> 01:28:24.218
Since we're out of time,

2259
01:28:24.218 --> 01:28:26.120
I need you to turn the roulette right away. Min Ki,

2260

We...

2266
01:28:34.429 --> 01:28:36.030
- We have to put this down. - The penalty...

2267
01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:39.267
Whoever gets picked will get the water bomb.

2268
01:28:39.267 --> 01:28:40.335
Turn it!

2269
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:45.306
(Their fates lies with this roulette!)

2270
01:28:45.306 --> 01:28:47.175
(Who will get the water bomb?)

01:29:09.797 --> 01:29:11.466
Don't worry.

2278
01:29:11.466 --> 01:29:13.101
You got the penalty again.

2279
01:29:13.101 --> 01:29:14.869
We should be saying...

2280
01:29:14.869 --> 01:29:16.404
- our last goodbyes. - Yes.

2281
01:29:16.404 --> 01:29:19.040

- I see how unlucky I am. - You're unlucky.

2283

2297
01:29:49.671 --> 01:29:51.005
We rushed,

2298
01:29:51.005 --> 01:29:52.607
- and now there's a minute left. - You told us to rush.

2299

We were saying goodbye, and it didn't occur to us.

2302
01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:02.750
Today, you came...

2303
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:05.787
all the way to a rest stop and proved how unlucky you are.

2304
01:30:05.787 --> 01:30:06.821
How do you feel?

2305
01:30:06.821 --> 01:30:08.056
Aside from how I feel,

2306
01:30:08.056 --> 01:30:09.123
I...

2307
01:30:09.424 --> 01:30:11.993
My pants are really wet right now.

2308
01:30:11.993 --> 01:30:13.394
- Do you feel damp? - It's damp.

2309
01:30:13.394 --> 01:30:14.862
- That is Chuseok. - Yes.

2310
01:30:14.862 --> 01:30:16.431
Chuseok should be damp.

2311
01:30:16.431 --> 01:30:18.366
- It should be damp? - Yes.

2312

Anyway, I think we can take our time...

2314
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:24.706
- to say our goodbyes. - Yes.

2315
01:30:24.706 --> 01:30:26.607
I suddenly thought of this.

2316
01:30:26.874 --> 01:30:29.410
We're always rushing too much with our lives.

2317
01:30:29.811 --> 01:30:31.379
It just occurred to me.

2318
01:30:31.379 --> 01:30:33.414
- We could have taken it slowly. - Yes.

2319
01:30:33.414 --> 01:30:35.316
We rushed too much.

2320
01:30:35.583 --> 01:30:37.785
My microphone was put on in a rush.

2321
01:30:37.785 --> 01:30:39.587
- It's such a mess. - Yes.

2322
01:30:39.587 --> 01:30:40.922
The lines are tangled.

2323
01:30:40.922 --> 01:30:43.157
- There are seven seconds left. - We should say bye.

2324
01:30:43.157 --> 01:30:45.226
We'll send you our goodbyes now.

2325

(about their mysterious existence.)

(The clues about the assistant...)
