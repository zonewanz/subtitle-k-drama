Kim Bom.

6
00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:17.625
What?

7
00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:21.577
- What?
- Huh?

8
00:02:22.245 --> 00:02:25.465
<i>Right, I'm here to convince Bom.</i>

9
00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:28.416
<i>How do I convince the cold Bom though?</i>

10
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:32.804
<i>Okay, I'll try to be
intelligent and logical.</i>

11
00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:34.647
If you have something
to say, say it.

12
00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:37.886
Well...

13
00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:42.244
We're going to be in the talent show.

14
00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:43.725
And?

15
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.070
We're going to do a dance number.

16
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.672
We have a bit of a problem though.

17
00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:52.161
It's not a problem really, but...

18
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.210
I think we need your help.

19
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.141
If you could help out a little...

20
00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:00.008
<i>Oh gosh. What am I saying right now?</i>

21
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:01.619
Okay.

22
00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.748
What? What are you saying okay to?

23
00:03:04.748 --> 00:03:07.379
You're asking me to be
in the talent show with you.

24
00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:09.328
I'm saying I'll do it with you.

25
00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:11.828
<i>Did I speak really well just now?</i>

26
00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:15.613
What are you going to do for me
if I do the talent show with you?

27
00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:17.488
I don't know.

28
00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:20.413
I'm doing it as volunteer work too.

29
00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:22.429
I think you should figure that out.

30
00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:26.332
I should figure out what I get out of it?

31
00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:42.179
- You hear about the talent show prize?
- What is it?

32
00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:43.856
- It's a bicycle.
- Wow.

33
00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.939
It is usually a ticket
to the culture center.

34
00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:57.095
Gosh, I leave for a training, and the
vice-principal has caused trouble again.

35
00:03:57.095 --> 00:03:58.195
Seriously.

36
00:03:59.074 --> 00:04:01.726
Why are there so many kinds of bikes?

37
00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:04.836
I've never ridden one before,
so I don't know which is good.

38
00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:07.055
Just buy the most expensive one.

39
00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:08.945
The vice-principal will cover it.

40
00:04:08.945 --> 00:04:10.954
Do you know how much
the most expensive one is?

41
00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:16.246
Do I really have to do this stuff?

42
00:04:17.584 --> 00:04:20.335
- Teacher.
- Yes. What is it, Shi Young?

43
00:04:20.335 --> 00:04:23.335
I heard the talent show prize
is a bike. Is that true?

44
00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:26.194
Wow, Gi Hoon couldn't keep it quiet.

45
00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:27.816
He just had to tell everyone.

46
00:04:27.816 --> 00:04:29.126
Yes, it is.

47
00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:31.056
I want to be in the show too.

48
00:04:31.056 --> 00:04:33.465
Your name wasn't on the list
the class president gave me.

49
00:04:33.465 --> 00:04:35.415
Not with that team,
but by myself.

50
00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:37.806
It isn't one team per class, is it?

51
00:04:37.806 --> 00:04:38.898
Of course, not.

52
00:04:38.898 --> 00:04:44.181
Shi Young, you must be singing or doing
a one-man show if you're doing it alone.

53
00:04:44.181 --> 00:04:47.169
Do you need an assistant?
I have lots of free time.

54
00:04:48.057 --> 00:04:49.064
No.

55
00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:55.444
I haven't seen her before.
Is she the transfer student?

56
00:04:55.444 --> 00:04:56.484
Oh, yes.

57
00:04:57.193 --> 00:04:58.446
The younger of two siblings.

58
00:05:03.662 --> 00:05:05.532
Oh, Bom!

59
00:05:07.686 --> 00:05:09.650
How long have you studied dance?

60
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.881
I have never studied dance.

61
00:05:10.881 --> 00:05:12.742
She's a natural... a natural.

62
00:05:12.742 --> 00:05:14.811
People who have never
studied are usually better.

63
00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:17.410
What kind of dancing do you like?

64
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.703
Sexy dance or a cute one?

65
00:05:20.563 --> 00:05:23.482
When I'm feeling down,
I like Girls' Generation or AOA.

66
00:05:23.482 --> 00:05:27.323
When I'm in a good mood,
Miss A, EXID, Girl's Day...

67
00:05:27.323 --> 00:05:29.754
It's done. First place is ours.

68
00:05:29.754 --> 00:05:32.318
That's enough. Let's pick a song.

69
00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:36.398
Why don't Shi Kyung and Bom
choose the song?

70
00:05:36.398 --> 00:05:38.126
We don't know much about that stuff.

71
00:05:38.126 --> 00:05:40.076
Do you want to do that?

72
00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:42.105
I don't know much either.

73
00:05:43.234 --> 00:05:44.938
But, okay. I'll do it.

74
00:05:44.938 --> 00:05:48.345
I don't have time today.
I'm having dinner with my dad.

75
00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:50.345
Then, when will we do it?

76
00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:54.054
I'll call you later.
You have my number from before, right?

77
00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:55.165
Did you save it?

78
00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:56.992
Uh, yeah.

79
00:06:00.698 --> 00:06:01.737
Let me see.

80
00:06:02.968 --> 00:06:05.749
Here it is. You didn't save it.

81
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:07.456
I'll save it now.

82
00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:20.617
Whose call are you waiting for?

83
00:06:20.617 --> 00:06:22.746
Huh? Yeah.

84
00:06:22.746 --> 00:06:24.787
Who? Ga Ram?

85
00:06:24.787 --> 00:06:28.057
No, it's someone
I'm doing the talent show with.

86
00:06:28.057 --> 00:06:32.939
Yes, I heard you're doing
the talent show at the hospice.

87
00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:35.967
Yeah, you and Grandma will come
to watch, won't you?

88
00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:39.857
Of course, I will go to see my grandson.

89
00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:43.811
Did you tell them?

90
00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:45.737
Tell us what?

91
00:06:45.737 --> 00:06:47.694
I saw him at the hospice.

92
00:06:47.694 --> 00:06:50.725
About Mom working in the hospice?
What about it?

93
00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:54.205
Mom, you work in the hospice?
What do you do?

94
00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:56.645
What could you do there?

95
00:06:56.645 --> 00:06:58.027
Oh...

96
00:06:58.027 --> 00:07:01.177
What kind of work? Like a nurse?

97
00:07:01.177 --> 00:07:04.910
You're not doing work like Grandma,
making burial clothes, are you?

98
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.290
Don't do work like that.

99
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.960
What's wrong with that?

100
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.441
I feel like I'm walking into a coffin
every time I walk into the room.

101
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:15.929
You think you'll never age or die?

102
00:07:15.929 --> 00:07:17.902
You'll never have to wear burial clothes?

103
00:07:17.902 --> 00:07:19.482
That's a long way off.

104
00:07:20.492 --> 00:07:23.374
Don't do it, Mom.
I don't like you working there.

105
00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:24.968
What's wrong with working there?

106
00:07:24.968 --> 00:07:27.247
What will you do if she doesn't work?

107
00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:29.910
Try digging in the ground.
See if you can find anything.

108
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.749
You said you don't even
bother dogs when they're eating.

109
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:35.013
Why are you constantly
bothering me, Grandma?

110
00:07:35.013 --> 00:07:37.653
That, that, that... mouth of yours.

111
00:07:37.653 --> 00:07:39.686
Lee Shi Young, stop and just eat.

112
00:07:42.944 --> 00:07:45.920
Lee Shi Kyung,
stop looking at your phone.

113
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:51.345
<i>Why isn't she calling?</i>

114
00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:57.146
<i>Is the reception bad
because we're in a rural town?</i>

115
00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:02.376
<i>[Dialing Ga Ram]</i>

116
00:08:04.874 --> 00:08:05.890
<i>What is it?</i>

117
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.198
Just saying goodnight.

118
00:08:07.198 --> 00:08:09.408
Hey. Look at the time.

119
00:08:09.408 --> 00:08:11.073
Hello?

120
00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:13.943
What was that about?

121
00:08:17.754 --> 00:08:19.383
<i>Nothing's wrong with the phone.</i>

122
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:21.890
<i>The reception is very good.</i>

123
00:08:22.722 --> 00:08:26.453
<i>Then, there is only one reason
why she hasn't called.</i>

124
00:08:28.492 --> 00:08:31.962
<i>Kim Bom forgot to call.</i>

125
00:08:46.664 --> 00:08:48.759
<i>[Kim Bom]</i>

126
00:09:07.977 --> 00:09:09.127
<i>It's the sexy Bom.</i>

127
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.156
Not this one.

128
00:09:22.557 --> 00:09:25.213
Won't this be hard for the kids to do?

129
00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:31.952
- You think we can do this?
- I don't know.

130
00:09:31.952 --> 00:09:33.772
I think it would be fun.

131
00:09:33.772 --> 00:09:35.376
I think the song is good.

132
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.896
- It's really fun.
- Yeah, I like it.

133
00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:40.339
I think this one is good.

134
00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:41.689
- This one?
- Yeah.

135
00:10:02.819 --> 00:10:04.894
<i>I haven't felt like this
since I stopped going</i>

136
00:10:04.894 --> 00:10:06.357
<i>to a girls-only bath house as a kid.</i>

137
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.871
<i>All the cells in my body have come
to life, and they're shouting.</i>

138
00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:12.030
<i>I'm going crazy with excitement.</i>

139
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.000
<i>I want to be closer to her.</i>

140
00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:27.942
<i>That night, I danced with Bom
for a long time in my dreams.</i>

141
00:10:30.142 --> 00:10:32.795
<i>It was a thrilling and ecstatic dream.</i>

142
00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:50.724
Oh dear. Look at that mess.

143
00:10:58.405 --> 00:10:59.885
Oh my word.

144
00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.368
What is this?

145
00:11:12.368 --> 00:11:16.899
What is this pile here?

146
00:11:36.448 --> 00:11:37.857
Have a nice day.

147
00:11:57.977 --> 00:12:00.416
It's too hard. I'm a bad dancer.

148
00:12:01.707 --> 00:12:03.567
Someone needs to show us how.

149
00:12:03.567 --> 00:12:06.678
Kim Bom, you and Shi Kyung chose it.

150
00:12:06.678 --> 00:12:07.746
You two should do it.

151
00:12:07.746 --> 00:12:10.136
Hey, all we did was choose it.

152
00:12:10.136 --> 00:12:12.447
We should all do one move.

153
00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:14.771
Yes, but still.

154
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:17.482
Bom, show us your dancing.

155
00:12:17.482 --> 00:12:22.299
Yes, Bom. We'll follow your lead. Go on.

156
00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:23.625
You want me to do it?

157
00:12:40.862 --> 00:12:44.333
<i>What? She can't move at all,
and they called her a dancing queen?</i>

158
00:13:02.902 --> 00:13:05.016
Kim Bom, what happened?

159
00:13:05.016 --> 00:13:08.010
- What?
- We heard you were the dancing queen.

160
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.229
Me? Who said that?

161
00:13:10.229 --> 00:13:11.929
You said so.

162
00:13:11.929 --> 00:13:15.209
Miss A, EXID, Girl's Day...
You can do all their dances.

163
00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:17.929
I said I listen to them
when I'm down and dance.

164
00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:19.371
When did I say I was good?

165
00:13:19.371 --> 00:13:20.921
I'm a terrible dancer.

166
00:13:22.325 --> 00:13:25.952
You said Kim Bom was a dancing queen.

167
00:13:25.952 --> 00:13:28.062
That was the rumor.
What am I supposed to do?

168
00:13:28.062 --> 00:13:32.519
What should we do?
We were all counting on Bom.

169
00:13:33.409 --> 00:13:35.863
Ah, now I get it.

170
00:13:35.863 --> 00:13:38.790
You guys don't have to worry. I'll leave.

171
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.228
I didn't really want to be
in the talent show anyway.

172
00:13:41.228 --> 00:13:44.229
Where are you going?
We're supposed to do it together.

173
00:13:44.229 --> 00:13:46.232
Do it with us.

174
00:13:46.232 --> 00:13:48.915
Let's change it to something easy
and all do it together.

175
00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.189
I heard you all were going insane
because of Bom.

176
00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:00.780
You laughed at me about cosplay,
and now look at you all.

177
00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.299
It's not that bad.

178
00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:04.956
What do you mean? It's totally bad.

179
00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:08.117
I heard that you're
entering too, Shi Young.

180
00:14:08.117 --> 00:14:10.347
Isn't it hard to do it alone?

181
00:14:10.347 --> 00:14:11.467
Should I help you?

182
00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:13.358
No, I have to do it alone.

183
00:14:13.358 --> 00:14:15.775
It only holds meaning if I do it alone.

184
00:14:15.775 --> 00:14:18.126
Okay, find lots of meaning.

185
00:14:18.126 --> 00:14:19.895
It will be your last show.

186
00:14:19.895 --> 00:14:23.458
Oh and make sure to wear that trash
in front of Mom and Grandma.

187
00:14:23.458 --> 00:14:26.255
Just thinking about it
makes me embarrassed for you.

188
00:14:26.255 --> 00:14:27.698
It isn't trash.

189
00:14:27.698 --> 00:14:28.889
Is it food waste?

190
00:14:28.889 --> 00:14:31.647
- Hey, Bernard.
- What, Trash?

191
00:14:31.647 --> 00:14:33.510
You're crazy, Bernard.

192
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.529
- What, are you food waste?
- What?

193
00:14:35.529 --> 00:14:36.891
Trash wins.

194
00:14:36.891 --> 00:14:39.044
I told you it's not trash.

195
00:14:42.543 --> 00:14:44.553
She doesn't have a chance, does she?

196
00:14:44.553 --> 00:14:46.353
No, she doesn't.

197
00:14:47.031 --> 00:14:48.525
No, she doesn't.

198
00:14:49.713 --> 00:14:52.232
Hey, can I listen to LP's at your house?

199
00:14:52.232 --> 00:14:53.524
Let's go.

200
00:15:08.564 --> 00:15:10.654
You're sitting up today.

201
00:15:10.654 --> 00:15:12.222
You're usually in bed all the time.

202
00:15:14.387 --> 00:15:17.884
Let me know if you want to call again.

203
00:15:21.245 --> 00:15:22.771
I'll call her for you.

204
00:15:22.771 --> 00:15:24.867
You want to hear your mother's voice.

205
00:15:24.867 --> 00:15:26.665
But, I'll probably get in trouble for it.

206
00:15:26.665 --> 00:15:29.507
Tell her to come visit you.

207
00:15:29.507 --> 00:15:32.820
She must miss you so much.

208
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.168
No... it's better if I die.

209
00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:48.447
Have you eaten anything?

210
00:15:53.005 --> 00:15:54.256
I made your burial clothes.

211
00:16:06.464 --> 00:16:10.761
I had an easy time sewing it,
so I think your path will be painless.

212
00:16:28.948 --> 00:16:32.996
Wow! Your dad collected a lot of LP's.

213
00:16:32.996 --> 00:16:35.471
I guess reading and listening
to music were his hobbies.

214
00:16:35.471 --> 00:16:37.958
His hobbies were quite noble unlike mine.

215
00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.435
Why do you talk about your dad
like he's a stranger?

216
00:16:40.435 --> 00:16:42.616
I don't have many memories of him.

217
00:16:43.857 --> 00:16:45.565
He went missing when I was seven.

218
00:16:45.565 --> 00:16:47.214
Missing?

219
00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:49.237
He was with Doctors Without Borders.

220
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:53.587
He went to a volatile region
and went missing.

221
00:16:57.146 --> 00:16:58.557
I don't have a mom.

222
00:16:59.664 --> 00:17:02.025
She passed away from cancer
when I was young.

223
00:17:03.895 --> 00:17:06.637
<i>There are many broken families
in this neighborhood other than mine.</i>

224
00:17:06.637 --> 00:17:09.151
Hey, don't say that.

225
00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:11.099
I hate hearing that more than anything.

226
00:17:12.491 --> 00:17:15.669
Hey, do you think Bom can do this?

227
00:17:20.143 --> 00:17:22.621
You know you're kind of obvious
with Kim Bom, don't you?

228
00:17:23.432 --> 00:17:24.631
Are you interested?

229
00:17:24.631 --> 00:17:26.033
Interested?

230
00:17:27.701 --> 00:17:28.848
It's more than that.

231
00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:30.214
Oh!

232
00:17:30.214 --> 00:17:31.627
She's unique.

233
00:17:31.627 --> 00:17:35.057
Sometimes, she's innocent.
Sometimes, she's sexy.

234
00:17:35.057 --> 00:17:38.954
At times, she appears clueless
and then very cold too.

235
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.778
She's like a video game character I like.

236
00:17:41.778 --> 00:17:43.084
Oh!

237
00:17:43.084 --> 00:17:46.186
If this works out well,
the vice-principal's wish will come true.

238
00:17:46.186 --> 00:17:47.585
What about her?

239
00:17:47.585 --> 00:17:49.324
Our school doesn't have a couple.

240
00:17:49.324 --> 00:17:52.185
Her wish is for there
to be a couple at school.

241
00:17:52.185 --> 00:17:53.716
That lady...

242
00:17:54.844 --> 00:17:56.345
Why aren't there any couples?

243
00:17:57.186 --> 00:18:00.715
Maybe because we all grew up together.
We have no fantasies about each other.

244
00:18:00.715 --> 00:18:02.551
We know each other too well.

245
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:06.528
I guess it's different
with transfer students.

246
00:18:07.518 --> 00:18:09.198
We're not dating.

247
00:18:11.218 --> 00:18:12.608
It's just a flirtation right now.

248
00:18:12.608 --> 00:18:15.548
Oh, a flirtation. Bernard.

249
00:18:15.548 --> 00:18:17.616
Hey, you too?

250
00:18:17.616 --> 00:18:19.668
<i>Aunt, Aunt!</i>

251
00:18:22.763 --> 00:18:25.826
What, what? Is there a cockroach?

252
00:18:25.826 --> 00:18:28.237
A cockroach? Where?

253
00:18:28.237 --> 00:18:30.517
I'm really scared of bugs.

254
00:18:30.517 --> 00:18:32.698
- Did you see my clothes in here?
- What clothes?

255
00:18:32.698 --> 00:18:35.287
My cosplay clothes in the plastic bag.

256
00:18:35.287 --> 00:18:36.487
Have you seen them?

257
00:18:36.487 --> 00:18:39.240
How would I know?
Did you take a good look?

258
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.277
I searched several times,
but it's not there.

259
00:18:42.277 --> 00:18:45.055
You said it was in a plastic bag, right?

260
00:18:45.055 --> 00:18:46.804
Yes. Have you seen it?

261
00:18:46.804 --> 00:18:50.161
I think I saw your grandma
carrying it out earlier.

262
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:51.239
Grandma?

263
00:18:51.239 --> 00:18:53.581
She must've thrown it out
thinking it was trash.

264
00:18:53.581 --> 00:18:56.021
I told you that it looks like trash.

265
00:19:10.401 --> 00:19:11.749
It worked out well.

266
00:19:11.749 --> 00:19:14.333
She will have
to give up cosplay for good.

267
00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:17.085
You know how much
that means to Shi Young.

268
00:19:17.085 --> 00:19:18.360
Shi Young!

269
00:19:19.179 --> 00:19:20.759
Seriously, gosh!

270
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.954
Hey! Stop it.

271
00:19:31.954 --> 00:19:33.064
Mind your own business.

272
00:19:39.448 --> 00:19:41.546
Put them on. You'll get frostbite.

273
00:19:43.817 --> 00:19:45.462
That crazy girl.

274
00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:52.547
Sorry you had to see that.

275
00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:56.746
You'll see this often
if you're around us enough.

276
00:20:09.513 --> 00:20:10.987
What is going on here?

277
00:20:12.772 --> 00:20:15.775
- Grandma, where are my clothes?
- What clothes?

278
00:20:15.775 --> 00:20:17.814
What did you do with my cosplay clothes?

279
00:20:17.814 --> 00:20:19.451
What are you talking about?

280
00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:21.564
Shi Young's cosplay clothes are gone.

281
00:20:22.687 --> 00:20:25.679
Mother, did you get rid of
Shi Young's clothes?

282
00:20:26.852 --> 00:20:29.042
I don't know anything about
this co-play or cot-play.

283
00:20:29.042 --> 00:20:32.053
There were some rags in the closet,
so I threw them out.

284
00:20:32.053 --> 00:20:34.671
Is it wrong to throw out trash?

285
00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:36.093
Where did you throw it out?

286
00:20:36.093 --> 00:20:38.922
I searched the neighborhood
trash, and it's not there.

287
00:20:38.922 --> 00:20:40.572
Don't you think garbage men work?

288
00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:44.122
Grandma, who are you to throw out
my belongings so carelessly?

289
00:20:44.122 --> 00:20:46.073
- Who do you think you are?
- Lee Shi Young!

290
00:20:46.073 --> 00:20:49.034
Go to your room.
Shi Kyung, take her to the room.

291
00:20:49.034 --> 00:20:51.527
- Come on.
- Let me go!

292
00:20:51.527 --> 00:20:55.249
As soon as Dad went missing
and we came to you...

293
00:20:55.249 --> 00:20:57.019
what did you do back then, Grandma?

294
00:20:57.019 --> 00:20:59.010
You kicked us out saying
you didn't want to see us.

295
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.537
Then you didn't see us for 10 years.

296
00:21:00.537 --> 00:21:04.519
You turned me away
when I was six years old.

297
00:21:04.519 --> 00:21:05.823
Are you even a real grandmother?

298
00:21:05.823 --> 00:21:09.680
Do you think you can become
a real grandma if you act like one now?

299
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.002
Why, you...

300
00:21:11.002 --> 00:21:13.726
Just, what are you trying to say!

301
00:21:13.726 --> 00:21:15.391
That's enough.

302
00:21:15.391 --> 00:21:17.641
I would've thrown that out
even if your grandma hadn't.

303
00:21:17.641 --> 00:21:19.689
Why do you hold it in, Mom?

304
00:21:19.689 --> 00:21:23.319
She said you were too hard
on your husband, causing his death.

305
00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:25.708
Why did you go cry
in your room by yourself?

306
00:21:25.708 --> 00:21:28.330
Grandma is the one
who is always harder on everyone.

307
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.477
Ruining your husband wasn't enough,
so you ruined your own son too!

308
00:21:31.477 --> 00:21:34.554
- What!
- What happened to Dad is your fault.

309
00:21:34.554 --> 00:21:35.822
Lee Shi Young.

310
00:21:35.822 --> 00:21:37.378
Grandma!

311
00:21:37.378 --> 00:21:39.419
Lee Shi Young, get out here.

312
00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:41.060
- Get out.
- Let go!

313
00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.090
- Leave now.
- What did I do wrong?

314
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.131
Hey!

315
00:21:55.566 --> 00:21:56.662
Shi Yoon.

316
00:21:59.952 --> 00:22:02.161
Get over here. Get over here now.

317
00:22:02.161 --> 00:22:03.952
Hurry up now.

318
00:22:03.952 --> 00:22:05.849
What did I do wrong?

319
00:22:05.849 --> 00:22:07.827
Have you lost your mind?

320
00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:08.919
Just let me go!

321
00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:12.769
No matter how angry you are,
how could you say that to Grandma?

322
00:22:12.769 --> 00:22:14.022
Is that how I raised you?

323
00:22:14.022 --> 00:22:15.190
Why are you picking on me?

324
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.985
Grandma wronged me first.
Why are you picking on me?

325
00:22:17.985 --> 00:22:20.353
- Lee Shi Young!
- Am I wrong?

326
00:22:20.353 --> 00:22:22.528
You have been thinking that
on the inside too.

327
00:22:22.528 --> 00:22:24.850
You hate Grandma
on the inside too, don't you?

328
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.682
No! I don't resent her.

329
00:22:27.682 --> 00:22:29.864
She has a right to feel that way.

330
00:22:29.864 --> 00:22:31.605
You are so fake.

331
00:22:31.605 --> 00:22:34.033
Why are you hitting me?

332
00:22:34.033 --> 00:22:37.205
What do you know about anything?
Are you inside my heart?

333
00:22:37.205 --> 00:22:42.700
Also, if you say whatever you feel,
you're an animal not a person.

334
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.192
If I'm an animal, then so are you.

335
00:22:45.192 --> 00:22:47.279
You want to continue saying crap
with that mouth?

336
00:22:47.279 --> 00:22:49.134
- Huh, huh?
- Ow!

337
00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:52.223
Don't say another word.
Get in there and apologize to Grandma.

338
00:22:52.223 --> 00:22:56.112
No! I won't apologize
until she brings my clothes back.

339
00:22:56.112 --> 00:22:57.955
I don't know what to do.

340
00:22:57.955 --> 00:23:00.425
I really need to find them.

341
00:23:00.425 --> 00:23:03.698
What's wrong with you?
When will you become a human being?

342
00:23:06.843 --> 00:23:07.938
Lie down.

343
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.682
Please understand.

344
00:23:12.682 --> 00:23:16.028
Once Shi Young explodes,
she can't see straight.

345
00:23:16.028 --> 00:23:18.537
Hold on. I'll get you some water.

346
00:23:26.757 --> 00:23:28.712
When did you get back?

347
00:23:33.863 --> 00:23:36.923
Your mom has been waiting for so long.

348
00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:44.983
- Get in there now.
- No!

349
00:23:44.983 --> 00:23:49.201
If you don't apologize today,
I really won't forgive you.

350
00:23:49.201 --> 00:23:51.057
No! I said no.

351
00:23:51.057 --> 00:23:54.576
Oh yeah? Let's see if you're going
to win or if I am going to win today.

352
00:23:54.576 --> 00:23:56.606
- No.
- Mom!

353
00:23:56.606 --> 00:23:59.013
- Something's wrong with Grandma.
- What?

354
00:24:01.212 --> 00:24:04.160
Mother! Mother...

355
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.774
Mother.

356
00:24:08.954 --> 00:24:10.296
Mother!

357
00:24:19.571 --> 00:24:20.741
That's strange.

358
00:24:20.741 --> 00:24:22.759
How was she acting strange?

359
00:24:22.759 --> 00:24:26.058
She was shaking and then went limp.

360
00:24:26.058 --> 00:24:28.599
So, I took her into her room.

361
00:24:28.599 --> 00:24:32.288
Suddenly, she stroked my face and said,
"When did you get back?"

362
00:24:33.349 --> 00:24:36.186
What are you talking about?

363
00:24:37.858 --> 00:24:40.296
Could you, at least, keep it together?

364
00:24:44.006 --> 00:24:45.427
It's true though.

365
00:24:53.253 --> 00:24:55.382
Shi Young, have breakfast.

366
00:24:55.382 --> 00:24:58.837
Let her go. She has no right to eat.

367
00:24:58.837 --> 00:25:00.112
What about Grandma?

368
00:25:00.112 --> 00:25:01.448
She went out.

369
00:25:01.448 --> 00:25:04.738
Where? She didn't move out, did she?

370
00:25:04.738 --> 00:25:07.801
Since when did you care
about her so much?

371
00:25:08.746 --> 00:25:10.283
Since I ate that soybean paste soup.

372
00:25:10.283 --> 00:25:13.433
That's good.
You have morning classes, right?

373
00:25:13.433 --> 00:25:16.204
Go help Grandma at the hospice
after your classes.

374
00:25:16.204 --> 00:25:19.775
She'll feel better if you help her out.

375
00:25:19.775 --> 00:25:21.593
I have practice after school.

376
00:25:21.593 --> 00:25:23.113
Go after practice.

377
00:25:23.113 --> 00:25:25.191
All right.

378
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:27.719
What's the problem? Things were fine.

379
00:25:27.719 --> 00:25:29.226
I'm just going to leave.

380
00:25:29.226 --> 00:25:30.944
We all agreed to do it together.

381
00:25:30.944 --> 00:25:34.455
I make them feel uncomfortable,
so why would I stay?

382
00:25:34.455 --> 00:25:37.685
We switched to an easier song,
so we just need to practice a little bit.

383
00:25:37.685 --> 00:25:38.977
Let's do it together.

384
00:25:38.977 --> 00:25:41.267
No, I hate being in an awkward position.

385
00:25:41.267 --> 00:25:45.285
You have missed so much school.
How could it not be a little awkward?

386
00:25:45.285 --> 00:25:46.785
That's why I'm going to leave.

387
00:25:46.785 --> 00:25:48.756
- What about me?
- What about you?

388
00:25:50.287 --> 00:25:52.951
If you aren't there,
I'm not going to do it either.

389
00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:55.181
- That's up to you.
- Let's do it.

390
00:25:59.962 --> 00:26:02.842
Wow. That was so awkward,
I thought I was going to die.

391
00:26:03.881 --> 00:26:06.553
See, I endured that awkward moment.

392
00:26:06.553 --> 00:26:09.822
I went "ahh" and made you laugh.

393
00:26:11.272 --> 00:26:14.233
Just try it a few times, and it will
become comfortable eventually.

394
00:26:15.672 --> 00:26:17.275
Dancing's not easy for me either.

395
00:26:18.211 --> 00:26:20.211
You could practice with me.

396
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:23.083
Oh, you said your dad's coming though.

397
00:26:23.083 --> 00:26:25.502
- Yeah.
- He comes often.

398
00:26:25.502 --> 00:26:27.137
Why don't you live together?

399
00:26:27.137 --> 00:26:30.002
My dad's a university professor in Seoul.

400
00:26:30.002 --> 00:26:31.811
<i>What? So, you're a rich girl?</i>

401
00:26:31.811 --> 00:26:35.105
I was sickly, so he wanted me to go to
school in a place where the air was good.

402
00:26:35.105 --> 00:26:36.639
So, he sent me here.

403
00:26:36.639 --> 00:26:38.787
Oh, I see.

404
00:26:44.048 --> 00:26:46.669
Hello? Yes, Mom.

405
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:50.808
I'm practicing with Ga Ram
and the others. That's why I'm late.

406
00:26:50.808 --> 00:26:54.183
What? They're practicing there?

407
00:26:55.484 --> 00:26:57.506
Okay, I'll be right there.

408
00:26:59.113 --> 00:27:00.215
Go.

409
00:27:01.124 --> 00:27:04.019
I'm going to head out.
Call me whenever you want.

410
00:27:29.043 --> 00:27:32.275
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E04 Andante "Scenes of Grandma"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

411
00:27:56.016 --> 00:27:57.419
I'm home.

412
00:28:04.567 --> 00:28:08.268
Dad, what does it mean to die?

413
00:28:08.268 --> 00:28:12.396
- Bom...
- Do you go away if you die?

414
00:28:12.396 --> 00:28:15.904
Will I not see you again?
Is that how it is?

415
00:28:17.025 --> 00:28:20.815
If you die, will I not
be able to see you?

416
00:28:21.614 --> 00:28:27.003
No, you can still see me
even when I'm gone, Bom.

417
00:28:27.003 --> 00:28:29.221
How can I do that?

418
00:28:31.058 --> 00:28:33.485
Do you have the ring I gave you?

419
00:28:34.468 --> 00:28:36.947
- This one?
- Yes, that one.

420
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.378
This is a secret that no one knows.

421
00:28:40.378 --> 00:28:43.602
That ring is an Absolute Ring.

422
00:28:43.602 --> 00:28:45.326
An Absolute Ring?

423
00:28:45.326 --> 00:28:51.610
As long as I have the ring,
I can do absolutely anything?

424
00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:52.650
Yes.

425
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:57.051
When you miss your dad,
rub the ring and call for me.

426
00:28:57.051 --> 00:29:01.384
Then I will say "ta-da"
and show up next to you, Bom.

427
00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:07.493
What a total liar.

428
00:29:13.727 --> 00:29:14.812
Mom.

429
00:29:14.812 --> 00:29:15.991
- Shi Kyung?
- Where are the kids?

430
00:29:15.991 --> 00:29:18.325
Go see your Grandma
before you meet up with them.

431
00:29:18.325 --> 00:29:22.154
Go run some errands for her
and rub her shoulders for her.

432
00:29:22.154 --> 00:29:23.801
Rub her shoulders too?

433
00:29:27.048 --> 00:29:28.162
Is it an emergency?

434
00:29:29.188 --> 00:29:31.037
It looks like it's
Mr. Kim Jae Woong's room.

435
00:29:33.557 --> 00:29:36.267
You were doing so well.
Why would you do this?

436
00:29:36.267 --> 00:29:37.998
Where did you get
agricultural pesticide?

437
00:29:37.998 --> 00:29:41.929
Do you know how much pain
this is going to cause you?

438
00:29:43.119 --> 00:29:46.131
Leave me alone to die.

439
00:29:46.131 --> 00:29:51.448
A man like me has no right
to live another day.

440
00:29:51.448 --> 00:29:52.628
Mr. Kim Jae Woong.

441
00:29:52.628 --> 00:29:57.090
Do you know how envious other patients
were when your colon drained?

442
00:29:58.237 --> 00:29:59.494
Please be strong.

443
00:30:09.475 --> 00:30:11.524
Hey, what is it?

444
00:30:11.524 --> 00:30:15.428
That man tried
to poison himself to death.

445
00:30:15.428 --> 00:30:16.625
Poison himself to death?

446
00:30:16.625 --> 00:30:18.476
He drank pesticide.

447
00:30:19.635 --> 00:30:20.775
Move!

448
00:30:33.124 --> 00:30:36.735
Is there... something you want to eat?

449
00:30:37.766 --> 00:30:41.081
Eat something before you go.

450
00:30:42.067 --> 00:30:44.212
I will make you what I can.

451
00:30:46.021 --> 00:30:48.064
There is nothing I want.

452
00:30:48.064 --> 00:30:52.220
All right, then I will decide
what to prepare on my own.

453
00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.243
Eat that before you go.

454
00:30:58.502 --> 00:31:01.160
Shi Kyung, go and get some
of my soybean paste.

455
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.102
It is in the first row from the back,
on the far left.

456
00:31:04.102 --> 00:31:06.931
Don't get it mixed up with the others.
Just bring that one.

457
00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:08.931
- Get going.
- Okay.

458
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.764
Shi Kyung, let's go together!

459
00:31:15.619 --> 00:31:17.024
I'll take you on my bike.

460
00:31:17.653 --> 00:31:19.432
The bus won't be here for a while.

461
00:31:19.432 --> 00:31:21.562
That would be great. Oh, wait...

462
00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:24.211
There's something better than the bike.

463
00:31:25.212 --> 00:31:28.321
You're hiring for a part-time job?
Are you okay with high school students?

464
00:31:28.321 --> 00:31:29.641
I'm in enrolled in school now.

465
00:31:29.641 --> 00:31:32.291
Yes, I'll be right there.

466
00:31:35.447 --> 00:31:37.890
<i>[Kim Bom, can you give me a ride
on your scooter again?]</i>

467
00:31:47.502 --> 00:31:49.960
Over here, over here! Hurry.

468
00:31:56.647 --> 00:31:57.938
Where are you going?

469
00:31:57.938 --> 00:32:00.690
My house. I have an urgent errand
to run for my grandma.

470
00:32:02.141 --> 00:32:03.496
Okay. Get on.

471
00:32:10.152 --> 00:32:12.215
First row from the back, on the far left.

472
00:32:12.215 --> 00:32:15.228
It's this one. What is it?

473
00:32:15.228 --> 00:32:17.810
Is it the hundred-year-old soybean
paste that I've heard about?

474
00:32:38.691 --> 00:32:39.746
Oh.

475
00:33:05.599 --> 00:33:08.265
Kim Bom, are you home?

476
00:33:08.265 --> 00:33:10.657
No, I'm about to go there now.

477
00:33:10.657 --> 00:33:13.325
Did you deliver the soybean paste?

478
00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:15.986
Yes, thanks to you.

479
00:33:15.986 --> 00:33:18.827
By the way, my Grandma's name
is Duk Boon.

480
00:33:21.548 --> 00:33:23.643
Grandma Duk Boon?
("Thanks to you" in Korean)

481
00:33:23.643 --> 00:33:25.052
It's a fun name, isn't it?

482
00:33:25.052 --> 00:33:27.541
Yeah, it is.

483
00:33:27.541 --> 00:33:29.573
I wish I only had
to run errands like this.

484
00:33:29.573 --> 00:33:30.997
What?

485
00:33:30.997 --> 00:33:34.006
Nothing. Thanks for today.

486
00:33:34.747 --> 00:33:35.869
Be careful getting home.

487
00:33:55.368 --> 00:33:57.186
Get up and have some food.

488
00:34:00.041 --> 00:34:02.021
I don't want to eat it.

489
00:34:02.021 --> 00:34:04.060
Please leave.

490
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.365
I didn't know what you would like.

491
00:34:07.168 --> 00:34:11.191
I made you my son's favorite
soybean paste soup.

492
00:34:13.018 --> 00:34:16.667
He could easily finish
one bowl of rice...

493
00:34:16.667 --> 00:34:19.612
whenever he ate my soybean paste soup.

494
00:34:19.612 --> 00:34:24.636
He went missing over 10 years ago,
and I don't know if he's dead or alive.

495
00:34:25.812 --> 00:34:31.824
I heard you left home long ago
and wish to see your mother.

496
00:34:33.924 --> 00:34:35.712
If my son were alive...

497
00:34:37.993 --> 00:34:40.199
he would be around your age.

498
00:34:41.808 --> 00:34:45.221
I prepared this meal
thinking of you as my son.

499
00:34:46.138 --> 00:34:49.522
Please think of it as a soybean paste
soup that was prepared by your mother.

500
00:34:49.522 --> 00:34:51.598
Have a spoonful.

501
00:35:00.518 --> 00:35:02.257
Meet your mother.

502
00:35:03.149 --> 00:35:06.174
No matter what state her child is in...

503
00:35:06.174 --> 00:35:12.750
just being able to see his face
would be more than enough.

504
00:35:14.094 --> 00:35:15.969
That is a mother's heart.

505
00:36:13.594 --> 00:36:15.044
Mom...

506
00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:22.319
Hey.

507
00:36:22.319 --> 00:36:24.819
That man usually doesn't eat well.

508
00:36:24.819 --> 00:36:26.310
He ate half of that soup.

509
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.906
No one can refuse Grandma Duk Boon's
soybean paste soup.

510
00:36:29.906 --> 00:36:32.357
Doesn't Grandma Duk Boon
have so much charisma?

511
00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:37.058
"Eat something before you go."

512
00:36:37.058 --> 00:36:38.419
That's not it.

513
00:36:39.145 --> 00:36:41.487
"You'll get hit if you don't eat."

514
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.187
Oh, it's Bom.

515
00:36:48.129 --> 00:36:50.406
Kim Bom, you don't usually
come to the hospice.

516
00:36:50.406 --> 00:36:52.538
- What brings you here?
- Where's Shi Kyung?

517
00:36:52.538 --> 00:36:54.496
Why are you looking for him?

518
00:36:54.496 --> 00:36:56.087
I need to talk to him.

519
00:36:56.087 --> 00:36:58.676
Shi Kyung went that way
with his grandma.

520
00:37:00.728 --> 00:37:03.357
This feels a little weird.

521
00:37:03.357 --> 00:37:06.690
What is this "thing"
they need to talk about?

522
00:37:10.015 --> 00:37:11.103
Oh my.

523
00:37:11.103 --> 00:37:14.301
Oh my, my, my. That feels good.

524
00:37:14.301 --> 00:37:15.391
Do you feel better?

525
00:37:15.391 --> 00:37:19.210
Yes, that feels good.

526
00:37:20.897 --> 00:37:22.855
l'm going to charge 1,000 won per minute.

527
00:37:24.107 --> 00:37:25.795
- 1,000 won.
- Really?

528
00:37:25.795 --> 00:37:27.281
Per hour.

529
00:37:30.752 --> 00:37:31.971
1,000 won.

530
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.250
Oh my... that is good.

531
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:41.457
Grandma, that soybean paste in the
jar in the first row from the back...

532
00:37:41.457 --> 00:37:42.962
What about it?

533
00:37:42.962 --> 00:37:45.435
What kind of soybean paste is it?

534
00:37:45.435 --> 00:37:47.355
Is it the hundred-year-old one?

535
00:37:47.355 --> 00:37:50.690
How do you know about that?

536
00:37:55.616 --> 00:37:57.448
Oh, Kim Bom!

537
00:37:59.917 --> 00:38:01.955
Did you come to see me?
You should've called.

538
00:38:01.955 --> 00:38:03.317
Who is this?

539
00:38:04.696 --> 00:38:05.741
Hello.

540
00:38:05.741 --> 00:38:09.370
This is my classmate, Kim Bom.
This is my grandma.

541
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.739
Kim Bom?

542
00:38:10.739 --> 00:38:12.640
Sit here.

543
00:38:18.118 --> 00:38:19.661
Your name is Bom?

544
00:38:20.319 --> 00:38:22.181
Who gave you that name?

545
00:38:22.181 --> 00:38:23.190
My dad.

546
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:27.301
He must've adored you so much
to give you the name Bom.

547
00:38:28.196 --> 00:38:30.145
What does your father do?

548
00:38:30.145 --> 00:38:32.170
He's a university professor in Seoul.

549
00:38:34.384 --> 00:38:36.212
Then, why are you here?

550
00:38:36.212 --> 00:38:39.690
She gets sick easily,
so she is here for the clean air.

551
00:38:40.712 --> 00:38:43.819
There are many places with clean air,
so why here of all places?

552
00:38:43.819 --> 00:38:46.167
Do you have relatives here?

553
00:38:46.167 --> 00:38:50.241
That's true. Why this strange place?

554
00:38:51.067 --> 00:38:54.591
I came here with my dad once,
and we liked it.

555
00:38:55.612 --> 00:38:58.933
The mountains, the water,
and the people here are all very good.

556
00:38:58.933 --> 00:39:02.533
You must be good in school
if you're the daughter of a professor.

557
00:39:02.533 --> 00:39:07.228
Please watch over my Shi Kyung.

558
00:39:07.228 --> 00:39:09.743
Grandma, I'm not a child.

559
00:39:09.743 --> 00:39:12.593
I will. Don't worry.

560
00:39:12.593 --> 00:39:15.114
You sure are charming.

561
00:39:15.114 --> 00:39:18.364
I wish Shi Young was
half the person you are.

562
00:39:18.364 --> 00:39:20.480
Come on, Grandma.

563
00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.285
Don't compare her to Shi Young.

564
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.361
Thank you.

565
00:39:25.969 --> 00:39:28.203
Grandma Duk Boon. Grandma Duk Boon.

566
00:39:28.203 --> 00:39:30.283
It's Oh Bong Sook. Please hurry.

567
00:39:30.283 --> 00:39:33.232
That ill-tempered old lady.
What is it now?

568
00:39:33.232 --> 00:39:35.004
Her daughter-in-law is here.

569
00:39:39.462 --> 00:39:41.364
- Come again.
- Bye now.

570
00:39:45.812 --> 00:39:48.071
<i>How many faces does she have?</i>

571
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:52.044
<i>What is this side
she showed to Grandma?</i>

572
00:39:52.044 --> 00:39:54.172
<i>I can't live!</i>

573
00:39:54.172 --> 00:39:57.489
<i>You're just waiting
 for me to die, you wench.</i>

574
00:40:00.357 --> 00:40:01.817
I know your grandma.

575
00:40:01.817 --> 00:40:04.047
- How?
- There was a thing.

576
00:40:04.047 --> 00:40:06.806
She probably doesn't remember me.

577
00:40:07.777 --> 00:40:10.176
What are you doing here anyway?

578
00:40:10.176 --> 00:40:13.703
Everyone says you don't like
coming to the hospice.

579
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:20.419
I wanted to say something to you.

580
00:40:20.419 --> 00:40:23.000
Say something? What is it?

581
00:40:31.165 --> 00:40:32.189
I'm going to head out.

582
00:40:32.189 --> 00:40:33.346
What were you going to say?

583
00:40:33.346 --> 00:40:34.799
I said it.

584
00:40:39.281 --> 00:40:42.015
What was that?
She said she had something to say.

585
00:40:48.181 --> 00:40:50.002
<i>Do you want to date me?</i>

586
00:41:07.123 --> 00:41:08.727
<i>My heart is racing.</i>

587
00:41:08.727 --> 00:41:10.757
<i>My heart is racing like crazy.</i>

588
00:41:15.207 --> 00:41:18.431
<i>Go home with Grandma.
I'm going to head home before her.</i>

589
00:41:24.431 --> 00:41:26.670
First row from the back.

590
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.775
The soybean paste on the far left.

591
00:41:28.775 --> 00:41:30.846
- It's this one.
- What about it?

592
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.940
Is it really a hundred years old?

593
00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.230
- Hundred years old?
- Yeah.

594
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:39.830
That's what the kids say.

595
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:43.627
Grandma has a hundred-year-old
soybean paste.

596
00:41:43.627 --> 00:41:44.810
Really?

597
00:41:47.812 --> 00:41:50.152
Is this it? I can't tell.

598
00:41:50.152 --> 00:41:51.181
Right?

599
00:41:51.181 --> 00:41:54.123
You could sell it for a high price
if it really is a hundred years old.

600
00:41:54.123 --> 00:41:55.694
Really?

601
00:42:03.402 --> 00:42:06.145
<i>Awesome. Let it melt slowly
in your mouth.</i>

602
00:42:06.145 --> 00:42:08.018
<i>The soybean paste tastes sweet.</i>

603
00:42:08.018 --> 00:42:09.194
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

604
00:42:12.178 --> 00:42:15.509
<i>A man at the hospice cried
because of this soybean paste.</i>

605
00:42:15.509 --> 00:42:17.185
<i>Really?</i>

606
00:42:24.547 --> 00:42:26.890
Come now. You're a good girl.

607
00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.725
Eat this.

608
00:42:31.457 --> 00:42:33.614
Yes. Be a good girl.

609
00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:38.062
It's still good, isn't it?

610
00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:55.199
<i>Just get out of here. Get away from me.</i>

611
00:42:55.199 --> 00:42:57.189
<i>Get out, you wench. Get out!</i>

612
00:42:57.189 --> 00:43:00.779
I'm going to die because of you,
all because of you!

613
00:43:00.779 --> 00:43:03.489
20 milligrams of morphine
and 5 milligrams of Valium.

614
00:43:03.489 --> 00:43:06.638
Doctor, please save me.

615
00:43:06.638 --> 00:43:10.219
All these people want me to die.

616
00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:13.237
How can I stand to see the people
who will be happy to see me die?

617
00:43:13.237 --> 00:43:15.299
So, please save me.

618
00:43:15.299 --> 00:43:16.790
There you go again.

619
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:19.998
You'll say something else after
taking medication and getting some sleep.

620
00:43:19.998 --> 00:43:23.176
Mother, I'll do a good job.

621
00:43:23.176 --> 00:43:27.230
- Who told you to buy this?
- Mother.

622
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.448
Get out! I can't stand the sight of you.

623
00:43:30.448 --> 00:43:34.192
I can't live because of you.

624
00:43:34.192 --> 00:43:35.835
Get out! Get out!

625
00:43:36.957 --> 00:43:40.591
Oh my goodness. Oh my, oh my, oh my.

626
00:43:40.591 --> 00:43:42.221
I'm going to die.

627
00:43:42.221 --> 00:43:46.426
I'm going to die sooner because of her.

628
00:43:46.426 --> 00:43:51.228
<i>The moment my heart raced at
the words "Do you want to date me"...</i>

629
00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:55.069
<i>another person's heart moaned in pain.</i>

630
00:43:56.388 --> 00:43:57.640
<i>What a world this is.</i>

631
00:43:59.245 --> 00:44:01.029
Is it that fun?

632
00:44:01.029 --> 00:44:02.040
Yes.

633
00:44:03.158 --> 00:44:04.388
What do you mean fun?

634
00:44:04.388 --> 00:44:08.540
I'm just getting it ready,
so it's easier for her to use.

635
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.466
Why would she use it?

636
00:44:10.466 --> 00:44:14.803
For her, it's like throwing
pearls to the pigs.

637
00:44:16.964 --> 00:44:18.002
Aren't you going home?

638
00:44:18.002 --> 00:44:19.779
Mom told me to go home with you.

639
00:44:23.808 --> 00:44:26.324
Oh, are you awake?

640
00:44:40.966 --> 00:44:42.739
You're still here?

641
00:44:44.616 --> 00:44:48.484
I have no one to welcome me
even if I go home.

642
00:44:48.484 --> 00:44:51.703
My granddaughter would prefer
that I come in late.

643
00:44:51.703 --> 00:44:53.319
Thank you.

644
00:44:53.319 --> 00:44:56.047
When I throw a fit,
they call me "Gap Jang"

645
00:44:56.047 --> 00:44:58.897
and I can't do anything about it.

646
00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:03.511
If you feel bad about it,
don't throw such a fit.

647
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:05.812
You say you're weak.

648
00:45:05.812 --> 00:45:08.679
What does "Gap Jang" mean?

649
00:45:08.679 --> 00:45:12.131
Oh, that's my grandson.

650
00:45:16.768 --> 00:45:19.040
He's good looking.

651
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.036
Your grandma and I are the same age.

652
00:45:23.036 --> 00:45:27.047
We were born in '48, the year of the rat.

653
00:45:27.047 --> 00:45:30.056
You don't know that "Gap Jang"
means people of the same age?

654
00:45:30.056 --> 00:45:32.158
This is the first I've heard it.

655
00:45:32.158 --> 00:45:36.228
I guess we don't understand
the kids these days either.

656
00:45:39.154 --> 00:45:40.170
Here you go.

657
00:45:43.024 --> 00:45:44.303
I don't need it.

658
00:45:44.303 --> 00:45:47.705
Still, your daughter-in-law
put her thought into it, so accept it.

659
00:45:47.705 --> 00:45:50.616
My daughter-in-law
would never think of doing it.

660
00:45:50.616 --> 00:45:53.687
She thinks I don't know
what she's thinking.

661
00:45:55.424 --> 00:45:59.873
They wouldn't care if I died
if it weren't for this.

662
00:45:59.873 --> 00:46:01.574
Both my son and daughter-in-law.

663
00:46:01.574 --> 00:46:05.266
Your children wouldn't do that
over a ring, would they?

664
00:46:05.266 --> 00:46:06.864
How much could that be worth?

665
00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:09.402
You don't know what you're talking about.

666
00:46:09.402 --> 00:46:11.542
This is worth a billion won.

667
00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:13.542
Don't you know about
the teardrop diamond?

668
00:46:13.542 --> 00:46:15.006
A billion won?

669
00:46:17.919 --> 00:46:22.339
All the money I had has been spent on
my illness, and this is what I have left.

670
00:46:22.339 --> 00:46:26.160
They are fighting to own it
and waiting for me to die.

671
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.692
I have seen all sorts
of people here, but still...

672
00:46:30.692 --> 00:46:33.710
You can throw that out, or
do whatever you want with it.

673
00:46:34.464 --> 00:46:36.958
You can do so much with this.

674
00:46:36.958 --> 00:46:40.160
You can make phone calls or video calls.

675
00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.567
Do you want to see?

676
00:46:45.678 --> 00:46:48.486
<i>Hello? Lee Shi Kyung,
did you buy a phone?</i>

677
00:46:48.486 --> 00:46:50.149
Isn't that Ga Ram?

678
00:46:50.149 --> 00:46:51.290
<i>Hello.</i>

679
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:54.969
It isn't mine. I'll explain later.

680
00:46:54.969 --> 00:46:57.614
- Come over to listen to LP's.
- <i>Okay.</i>

681
00:46:57.614 --> 00:46:59.772
There are no faces I want to see.

682
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.000
You can listen to music with this.

683
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.143
It can read books to you,
and the games are really...

684
00:47:08.143 --> 00:47:09.310
She said no.

685
00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:10.931
You can play Go-Stop too.

686
00:47:12.906 --> 00:47:13.906
Go-Stop?

687
00:47:23.437 --> 00:47:25.799
I like the voice. Who is it?

688
00:47:25.799 --> 00:47:28.377
"Beautiful Person" by Kim Min Ki.

689
00:47:33.699 --> 00:47:34.745
Hey.

690
00:47:36.156 --> 00:47:39.131
Suppose there is this girl.

691
00:47:39.131 --> 00:47:42.118
What would you say
if she asked to date you?

692
00:47:42.118 --> 00:47:44.397
Bom asked to date you?

693
00:47:44.397 --> 00:47:46.937
No! What are you saying?

694
00:47:47.609 --> 00:47:50.109
I just thought of that
while listening to the music.

695
00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:54.027
I said no.

696
00:47:54.027 --> 00:47:56.199
I said suppose, didn't I?

697
00:47:56.199 --> 00:47:57.328
So, it is Bom.

698
00:47:57.328 --> 00:47:59.583
I better call the vice-principal.

699
00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:01.192
Why would you call her?

700
00:48:01.192 --> 00:48:03.194
To tell her the school
finally has a couple.

701
00:48:03.194 --> 00:48:06.033
I said it's not that.

702
00:48:06.033 --> 00:48:08.795
I would have to answer her
for it to be dating or not.

703
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:13.835
Then it is Bom.

704
00:48:13.835 --> 00:48:17.658
Hey, Lee Shi Young!
Your brother's friend is here.

705
00:48:17.658 --> 00:48:18.768
You said she wasn't home.

706
00:48:18.768 --> 00:48:20.219
She's not home.

707
00:48:21.145 --> 00:48:23.469
Why isn't she home?

708
00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:25.710
This isn't what I ordered.

709
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:29.833
I told you no chili sauce and no olives.

710
00:48:29.833 --> 00:48:31.929
I told them. I'm sorry.

711
00:48:31.929 --> 00:48:33.120
I'll put in your order again.

712
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.795
Forget it. Give me a refund.

713
00:48:35.795 --> 00:48:38.015
- Pardon me?
- Didn't you hear me?

714
00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:40.025
Give me a refund.

715
00:48:41.297 --> 00:48:45.174
This is a crappy neighborhood.
I don't like anything here.

716
00:48:47.214 --> 00:48:50.241
My part-time job?
No one knows about it.

717
00:48:50.241 --> 00:48:53.585
I need to buy a phone and a bicycle.

718
00:48:54.473 --> 00:48:55.647
There's a reason why.

719
00:48:55.647 --> 00:48:59.734
Okay, Ji Min. I'll talk to you later.

720
00:49:04.527 --> 00:49:09.174
It's totally my style.
It would be perfect with skinny jeans.

721
00:49:17.623 --> 00:49:19.725
Oh, it's Kim Bom.

722
00:49:36.118 --> 00:49:37.556
Class 2 president.

723
00:49:37.556 --> 00:49:39.687
Who me?

724
00:49:39.687 --> 00:49:41.837
- Aren't you the president?
- Yes.

725
00:49:41.837 --> 00:49:43.768
Go to your homeroom teacher.

726
00:49:43.768 --> 00:49:47.344
Get the two transfer students' records
and bring them to the consult room.

727
00:49:47.344 --> 00:49:49.603
Then tell them to go there.

728
00:49:49.603 --> 00:49:50.728
Okay.

729
00:49:50.728 --> 00:49:51.855
Hey!

730
00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:55.056
I told you not to wear anything
over your uniform during class time.

731
00:49:55.056 --> 00:49:56.457
It's break time now.

732
00:49:56.457 --> 00:49:58.462
You were wearing it during class too.

733
00:49:58.462 --> 00:49:59.714
I'm sick.

734
00:49:59.714 --> 00:50:04.806
I can't ever remember seeing you
dressed properly in uniform.

735
00:50:04.806 --> 00:50:08.987
Why is it that you rebel
with little things like this?

736
00:50:08.987 --> 00:50:10.489
I told you I'm feeling sick.

737
00:50:12.078 --> 00:50:13.442
You go to the consult room too.

738
00:50:18.746 --> 00:50:22.408
Everyone says the student dean
is a total liar and a show off.

739
00:50:22.408 --> 00:50:24.625
He also discriminates and has favorites.

740
00:50:36.248 --> 00:50:37.607
<i>What does your father do?</i>

741
00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.542
I asked you what your father does.

742
00:50:42.542 --> 00:50:43.910
Lee Shi Kyung.

743
00:50:48.239 --> 00:50:49.272
What is this?

744
00:50:50.625 --> 00:50:51.752
Aren't you two siblings?

745
00:50:51.752 --> 00:50:53.428
- We are.
- Then why?

746
00:50:54.942 --> 00:50:57.949
Do you have different fathers?

747
00:50:57.949 --> 00:51:00.156
- Excuse me?
- Then what is this?

748
00:51:01.596 --> 00:51:03.654
Father's name is Lee Shi Yoon.

749
00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:06.295
Lee Shi Yoon?

750
00:51:08.207 --> 00:51:11.214
Lee Shi Kyung wrote down
that he does not have a father.

751
00:51:11.214 --> 00:51:14.531
Lee Shi Young wrote that her father is
working abroad, so what happened?

752
00:51:14.531 --> 00:51:18.478
Lee Shi Kyung, you have
no father listed here.

753
00:51:18.478 --> 00:51:20.098
Well, that's...

754
00:51:21.156 --> 00:51:26.522
Our father went missing 12 years ago.

755
00:51:26.522 --> 00:51:27.562
And?

756
00:51:28.551 --> 00:51:31.263
It was in a war region.

757
00:51:31.263 --> 00:51:32.433
So, what?

758
00:51:32.433 --> 00:51:34.397
- What about it?
- Were you there?

759
00:51:34.397 --> 00:51:37.174
Do you know if Dad is dead or alive?

760
00:51:37.174 --> 00:51:39.502
You weren't there, so why would
you say we have no dad?

761
00:51:39.502 --> 00:51:40.723
Hey, stop that.

762
00:51:40.723 --> 00:51:42.669
When did I say that?

763
00:51:42.669 --> 00:51:44.406
You wrote down that you have no dad.

764
00:51:44.406 --> 00:51:45.616
What about you?

765
00:51:45.616 --> 00:51:47.995
Did you confirm if he's dead or alive?

766
00:51:47.995 --> 00:51:49.094
Stop, stop, stop.

767
00:51:49.094 --> 00:51:51.366
You two can fight later.

768
00:51:51.366 --> 00:51:53.216
You and Mom are just alike.

769
00:51:53.216 --> 00:51:56.395
How can you erase Dad
so easily like that?

770
00:51:56.395 --> 00:51:58.641
It's not like that.

771
00:51:58.641 --> 00:52:00.080
What do you mean it's not?

772
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.228
- Yes, Vice-Principal.
- Then, why didn't you write him?

773
00:52:02.228 --> 00:52:05.457
Is he not enough of a person
to write on a piece of paper now?

774
00:52:05.457 --> 00:52:07.469
Many people died there.

775
00:52:07.469 --> 00:52:11.118
Can you be sure that he's alive?

776
00:52:11.118 --> 00:52:14.259
There is a one percent chance
for miracles in the world.

777
00:52:14.259 --> 00:52:17.219
Sure, go on and believe in miracles.

778
00:52:18.089 --> 00:52:19.949
- But, don't force me to.
- Yes, okay.

779
00:52:20.636 --> 00:52:21.645
Hey!

780
00:52:23.772 --> 00:52:25.542
What are you doing
in front of your teacher?

781
00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:27.611
- Why do you even do these things?
- What?

782
00:52:28.632 --> 00:52:29.824
What did you say?

783
00:52:29.824 --> 00:52:32.567
Why do you care if our dad is dead,
alive, or what he does?

784
00:52:32.567 --> 00:52:33.910
Why should we tell you?

785
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:37.183
Ah, so you know who the rich kids are,
so you can give them special treatment.

786
00:52:37.183 --> 00:52:39.665
You little punk.
How dare you speak that way!

787
00:52:39.665 --> 00:52:44.350
Do you know that it's like torture for
some students to write these things?

788
00:52:45.933 --> 00:52:47.015
Stop right there.

789
00:52:47.015 --> 00:52:50.315
Stop right there! Hey!
