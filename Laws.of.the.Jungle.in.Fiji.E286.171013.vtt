00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:08.518
On Fiji's Modriki's Island,

2
00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:11.317
Byung Man's Tribe tried to survive as in the film "Cast Away".

3
00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:12.858
(They tried to survive without any tool.)

4
00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:15.898
Thanks to the veteran and rookie members' combined efforts,

5
00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:17.758
they survived on their first spot.

6
00:00:18.398 --> 00:00:22.238
Part two of their survival begins in a picturesque place.

7
00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:26.008
One team went to Navua River where the second "Anacondas" was filmed,

8
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:28.337
and another team went to survive on Yasawa Islands...

9
00:00:28.337 --> 00:00:30.638
where "The Blue Lagoon" was filmed.

10
00:00:30.638 --> 00:00:31.838
(They will survive as two separate teams.)

11
00:00:31.838 --> 00:00:35.317
And veteran member Jong Hyuk has a special mission.

12
00:00:36.217 --> 00:00:39.647
Would they be able to face the Mother Nature...

13
00:00:39.647 --> 00:00:41.687
and end their trip safely?

14
00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:44.388
(4 members arrive at their 2nd survival zone.)

15
00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:45.427
It looks great.

16
00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:47.028
Let's go.

17
00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:49.728
Welcome to your second survival zone.

18
00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:51.458
Thank you. This is great.

19
00:00:51.827 --> 00:00:53.797
We have equipment now,

20
00:00:53.797 --> 00:00:55.768
so we have everything we can ask for.

21
00:00:55.897 --> 00:01:00.408
- Please put your backpacks down. - Why?

22
00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:02.007
(Are they getting their backpacks taken away again?)

23
00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:03.937
I won't get fooled again.

24
00:01:04.508 --> 00:01:05.707
Come here.

25
00:01:05.707 --> 00:01:07.178
(Come here.)

26
00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:09.547
He's really angry right now.

27
00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:11.747
The river you see behind you is...

28
00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:16.558
Navua River where the film "Anacondas" was shot.

29
00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:19.228
- Really? Here? - Yes.

30
00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:22.327
Are there anacondas here then?

31
00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:26.668
So this survival will take place by this river.

32
00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:27.997
- Sorry? - What?

33
00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:30.497
(We need to survive by this river?)

34
00:01:32.038 --> 00:01:33.707
Do you remember this?

35
00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:37.838
In the movie, the characters have bloody battles with giant anacondas.

36
00:01:38.207 --> 00:01:42.077
It's Navua River where "Anacondas" part two was filmed.

37
00:01:42.077 --> 00:01:43.448
(Navua River was the setting for the film.)

38
00:01:43.778 --> 00:01:47.118
Will Byung Man's Tribe be able to survive here?

39
00:01:49.717 --> 00:01:50.818
It's another movie.

40
00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:52.127
(You can never let your guard down in the jungle.)

41
00:01:53.558 --> 00:01:55.928
We have all the equipment...

42
00:01:56.058 --> 00:01:57.997
- so let's build a shelter first. - Okay.

43
00:01:58.097 --> 00:01:59.728
We can hunt too.

44
00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:01.528
- Let's build a shelter. - I feel prepared.

45
00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:03.797
Chae Kyung, give us some energy.

46
00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:06.908
- Sung Hoon, look at her. - Okay.

47
00:02:07.538 --> 00:02:09.607
Let's have a fun time.

48
00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:11.438
Let's go, The Law of Jungle.

49
00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:13.177
(That was too much.)

50
00:02:14.408 --> 00:02:16.147
- Let's go. - Let's do this.

51
00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:17.478
- Let's go. - Go.

52
00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:19.718
- Let's go. - I feel energized. Let's go, April.

53
00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:21.617
- I feel energized. - Stop lying.

54
00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:22.918
You're so cute.

55
00:02:22.918 --> 00:02:25.487
(The tropical rain forest is completely different from the sea.)

56
00:02:25.487 --> 00:02:26.487
I'm tired.

57
00:02:28.897 --> 00:02:29.897
What's this?

58
00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:31.797
- Coconut? - It's a coconut.

59
00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:33.427
It's big.

60
00:02:33.427 --> 00:02:34.468
I have a good feeling.

61
00:02:34.468 --> 00:02:36.897
The tree is low, so I think we can get it.

62
00:02:37.897 --> 00:02:38.908
It's doable.

63
00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:42.207
Those are helpful for building shelters. We can lay it down.

64
00:02:42.207 --> 00:02:43.438
We can build a roof too.

65
00:02:43.438 --> 00:02:45.107
(Woo Jin surveys the area.)

66
00:02:45.107 --> 00:02:46.577
(It seems more plentiful than the sea.)

67
00:02:46.577 --> 00:02:49.677
The environment seems nicer.

68
00:02:49.718 --> 00:02:51.718
I agree. There's more to eat.

69
00:02:51.848 --> 00:02:53.288
This tree is pretty.

70
00:02:53.517 --> 00:02:54.848
- It's pretty. - Right?

71
00:02:55.718 --> 00:02:56.718
Look at the color.

72
00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.388
(Spathodea is a plant with edible seeds. Its leaves are medicinal.)

73
00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:02.128
I hear birds chirping.

74
00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:03.658
We can eat them too.

75
00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:08.198
It seems more plentiful than the sea.

76
00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:10.598
Look. It's all soil now.

77
00:03:10.998 --> 00:03:14.468
As you go deeper into the forest, the soil doesn't dry,

78
00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:15.707
so that's the difficult part.

79
00:03:15.707 --> 00:03:16.908
(They start to get tense as the environment changes.)

80
00:03:16.908 --> 00:03:18.008
- It's slippery. - It's started.

81
00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:23.277
You might get hurt so please be careful.

82
00:03:23.277 --> 00:03:25.348
- Yes. - Yes.

83
00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:27.248
(They start seeing more bugs as well.)

84
00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:29.318
There are a lot of bugs.

85
00:03:29.487 --> 00:03:31.487
I haven't seen bugs for a while.

86
00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:35.897
There are so many bugs.

87
00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:38.297
(Is this place suitable for their survival?)

88
00:03:38.297 --> 00:03:39.297
Hold on.

89
00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:41.998
This tree is huge.

90
00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:43.897
These trees are way bigger.

91
00:03:43.897 --> 00:03:45.508
(The environment keeps on changing every moment.)

92
00:03:46.068 --> 00:03:47.568
- These trees are huge. - They're scary.

93
00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:49.237
I wonder how old they are.

94
00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:50.978
They're probably a few hundred years old.

95
00:03:51.438 --> 00:03:53.177
This is the Amazon.

96
00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:54.748
I think there will be a lot of mosquitoes.

97
00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:57.177
I don't like places like these.

98
00:03:57.918 --> 00:03:59.918
Water is so much better. I really don't like this.

99
00:03:59.918 --> 00:04:01.248
Me too. There are bugs.

100
00:04:01.248 --> 00:04:02.658
There are so many bugs.

101
00:04:02.658 --> 00:04:04.658
(Can they survive when there are so many trees, bugs, and mud?)

102
00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:05.758
It's so crowded.

103
00:04:05.888 --> 00:04:07.728
Do you think we can find a spot to sleep?

104
00:04:12.468 --> 00:04:16.037
Where should we build a shelter, Sung Hoon?

105
00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:19.207
- An area? - Should we go by the water...

106
00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:21.368
or near the woods?

107
00:04:22.138 --> 00:04:23.878
Isn't the water better? The woods...

108
00:04:24.738 --> 00:04:25.977
It's a valley.

109
00:04:27.878 --> 00:04:28.878
It's clean.

110
00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:30.017
Right?

111
00:04:30.178 --> 00:04:32.087
What's this? Is this a pathway?

112
00:04:32.287 --> 00:04:35.417
It might be better to catch fish here than the sea.

113
00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:38.217
I agree. Are there shrimps here?

114
00:04:38.217 --> 00:04:39.628
Shrimps? There are shrimps in fresh water.

115
00:04:39.628 --> 00:04:40.727
- Right? - Yes.

116
00:04:41.327 --> 00:04:43.298
Do you think there will be fish here, Sung Hoon?

117
00:04:43.298 --> 00:04:45.428
We can make a harpoon and catch fish.

118
00:04:45.527 --> 00:04:47.167
We can,

119
00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:49.597
but it's not easy to catch fish.

120
00:04:49.597 --> 00:04:50.738
It's difficult in areas like these.

121
00:04:52.808 --> 00:04:54.167
- What? - It's a waterfall.

122
00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:56.178
(There's a waterfall?)

123
00:04:56.178 --> 00:04:57.378
- It's a waterfall. - That's amazing.

124
00:04:59.178 --> 00:05:00.248
This is amazing.

125
00:05:00.248 --> 00:05:01.378
(They start to hurry up.)

126
00:05:01.378 --> 00:05:03.347
- It's huge. - It's tall.

127
00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:06.888
(There's really a waterfall.)

128
00:05:06.888 --> 00:05:08.287
This is no joke.

129
00:05:09.618 --> 00:05:11.688
- It's huge. - It's amazing.

130
00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:14.558
It's the biggest fall I've ever seen.

131
00:05:14.688 --> 00:05:15.998
It's tall.

132
00:05:17.298 --> 00:05:18.998
It's beautiful.

133
00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:20.727
(It's a 40m tall waterfall in Navua River.)

134
00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:21.928
This is a movie.

135
00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:24.337
- I approve. - It's beautiful.

136
00:05:24.337 --> 00:05:25.707
(It's 40m tall and 10m wide.)

137
00:05:26.407 --> 00:05:28.068
It's beautiful.

138
00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:30.178
(They are amazed by its size.)

139
00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:33.207
(The water drops from a 40m height.)

140
00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:34.777
This is no joke.

141
00:05:34.777 --> 00:05:35.948
(The water drops from a 40m height.)

142
00:05:35.948 --> 00:05:37.347
("Nature and books belong to all who see them." by Ralph Waldo Emerson)

143
00:05:37.347 --> 00:05:38.577
Don't you want to go under it?

144
00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:39.688
("Nature and books belong to all who see them." by Ralph Waldo Emerson)

145
00:05:42.358 --> 00:05:43.517
Can we build our shelter here?

146
00:05:43.988 --> 00:05:45.888
- I think it's okay. - The ground...

147
00:05:45.888 --> 00:05:47.157
might be a bit uneven.

148
00:05:47.157 --> 00:05:49.058
This won't overflow, right?

149
00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:51.657
- It won't. - As long as it doesn't rain.

150
00:05:51.657 --> 00:05:54.227
- Let's stay here then. - If it rains, it'll cover this.

151
00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:56.568
- There won't be any bugs. - But the rain...

152
00:05:56.568 --> 00:05:57.568
Right?

153
00:05:57.837 --> 00:06:00.808
- We can keep going. Should we try? - Shall we?

154
00:06:00.808 --> 00:06:03.407
Let's try it first. We'll consider this an option.

155
00:06:03.407 --> 00:06:04.537
- Let's keep it as an option. - We know now.

156
00:06:04.537 --> 00:06:05.577
Let's keep it.

157
00:06:05.577 --> 00:06:06.847
Let's go first.

158
00:06:06.847 --> 00:06:10.777
- There might be something more. - Let's keep going first.

159
00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:12.488
- Let's go. - This is an option.

160
00:06:13.318 --> 00:06:14.388
(This is their potential spot.)

161
00:06:14.388 --> 00:06:17.558
Sung Hoon's team has a potential survival zone in mind.

162
00:06:18.188 --> 00:06:21.358
They are hopeful that the conditions will get even better...

163
00:06:21.358 --> 00:06:22.397
and they move towards the falls.

164
00:06:23.128 --> 00:06:25.928
Will they find their utopia?

165
00:06:27.167 --> 00:06:28.767
(Monuriki Island)

166
00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:31.097
Meanwhile, the three rookie members...

167
00:06:31.097 --> 00:06:33.967
move towards Yasawa Islands on the northwest side of Fiji.

168
00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:37.977
You've watched The Law of Jungle a lot, right? We can do it.

169
00:06:38.337 --> 00:06:40.777
I'm not confident without the Chief.

170
00:06:40.847 --> 00:06:42.318
Me neither.

171
00:06:42.678 --> 00:06:45.347
This is the island we'll be surviving on.

172
00:06:45.347 --> 00:06:47.647
It's a film from the 80s so you may not know this...

173
00:06:47.647 --> 00:06:49.217
- We don't know. - What is it?

174
00:06:49.217 --> 00:06:52.188
It's a film called "The Blue Lagoon" with Brooke Shields.

175
00:06:52.188 --> 00:06:54.457
- "The Blue Lagoon"? - Isn't it really sexual?

176
00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:56.597
- Did they film it here? - Yes.

177
00:06:56.597 --> 00:06:57.928
- Here? - Here?

178
00:06:59.227 --> 00:07:03.037
("The Blue Lagoon" is a film about two people who survive a shipwreck,)

179
00:07:03.037 --> 00:07:06.938
(and grow to love each other while surviving on an uninhabited island.)

180
00:07:06.938 --> 00:07:08.537
(This is Brooke Shields when she was 14.)

181
00:07:09.938 --> 00:07:13.808
(Yasawa Islands was the setting of the film.)

182
00:07:14.777 --> 00:07:16.548
(Try to survive like me.)

183
00:07:17.477 --> 00:07:19.917
- Is it a romance film? - Right. I remember.

184
00:07:20.417 --> 00:07:22.858
Why did you leave the three of us here then?

185
00:07:22.858 --> 00:07:25.258
- What do you think? - When the three of us left,

186
00:07:25.258 --> 00:07:27.457
- I wasn't afraid of anything. - Exactly.

187
00:07:27.457 --> 00:07:31.097
I thought we wouldn't need the veteran members but now...

188
00:07:31.327 --> 00:07:33.097
- This is depressing. - Now that we're here...

189
00:07:33.097 --> 00:07:36.037
- What are you and I going to do? - I wish we had Woo Jin.

190
00:07:36.037 --> 00:07:37.868
- I know. - Right?

191
00:07:37.868 --> 00:07:40.608
- It's better to have him. - I wish he was here.

192
00:07:41.207 --> 00:07:42.308
We have no clue.

193
00:07:42.308 --> 00:07:43.407
(He's worried.)

194
00:07:43.407 --> 00:07:45.577
Who do you think is suitable as the chief?

195
00:07:45.577 --> 00:07:47.108
Who do you want the chief to be?

196
00:07:47.448 --> 00:07:50.077
I don't think there's anyone here who can be the chief.

197
00:07:50.077 --> 00:07:53.647
We need one person to give orders.

198
00:07:55.217 --> 00:07:57.717
(What is this hint I'm getting?)

199
00:07:57.717 --> 00:07:59.457
(He appeals with his eyes.)

200
00:07:59.457 --> 00:08:00.558
- Sure, you can do it. - Really?

201
00:08:00.558 --> 00:08:01.858
(There you go.)

202
00:08:01.858 --> 00:08:02.998
Okay.

203
00:08:02.998 --> 00:08:05.397
It doesn't mean anything.

204
00:08:05.397 --> 00:08:07.027
- I always wanted to do this. - Really?

205
00:08:07.027 --> 00:08:09.337
(He wants to be the center.)

206
00:08:09.337 --> 00:08:10.738
- Chief. - Sure.

207
00:08:10.738 --> 00:08:12.508
- Chief. - We trust you.

208
00:08:12.508 --> 00:08:13.868
- Let's go. - Let's go.

209
00:08:14.167 --> 00:08:15.238
Let's go.

210
00:08:16.178 --> 00:08:18.808
- I'm starving. - Let's go get lobsters.

211
00:08:18.808 --> 00:08:19.878
- Let's go. - Let's go.

212
00:08:19.878 --> 00:08:21.308
Let's get it.

213
00:08:21.707 --> 00:08:23.517
Let's look for a suitable spot to build a shelter.

214
00:08:23.517 --> 00:08:25.417
- That's right. - Here?

215
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:28.858
We can use this as a harpoon.

216
00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:30.118
- That looks good. - Okay.

217
00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:33.628
I hate that I have to look for these as I'm walking.

218
00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:36.458
- I hate it. - You're adapting.

219
00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:39.128
We can put a knife on this. Good.

220
00:08:41.868 --> 00:08:43.338
Here's the firewood.

221
00:08:43.338 --> 00:08:45.468
This will burn well.

222
00:08:45.468 --> 00:08:47.667
- It's all firewood here. - How so?

223
00:08:48.108 --> 00:08:50.807
- There are so many of them. - They're mine. Don't touch them.

224
00:08:51.777 --> 00:08:52.848
- Let's go around. - Let's go in.

225
00:08:52.848 --> 00:08:54.578
- That's so pretty. - I think...

226
00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:56.848
this is a good spot.

227
00:08:57.917 --> 00:09:00.447
It's not windy here, so we'll be able to light a fire.

228
00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:02.758
- Right? - This is a good spot.

229
00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:03.787
This is good.

230
00:09:03.787 --> 00:09:06.358
(Did Roy decide on a good spot?)

231
00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.628
This is totally our shelter.

232
00:09:08.628 --> 00:09:09.858
(It's shady and flat.)

233
00:09:10.328 --> 00:09:11.828
This is good.

234
00:09:11.828 --> 00:09:14.998
- Here. - I'll buy this land.

235
00:09:15.968 --> 00:09:17.937
- You'll buy it? - This is exactly it.

236
00:09:17.937 --> 00:09:18.968
(They decide on a spot.)

237
00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:20.907
- I think this is good. - It's good.

238
00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:25.108
- Okay. - Let's do this then.

239
00:09:25.108 --> 00:09:27.508
The tide is rising now...

240
00:09:27.508 --> 00:09:28.748
There will be fish drifting towards shore.

241
00:09:28.748 --> 00:09:31.677
There will be fish drifting towards here,

242
00:09:31.677 --> 00:09:34.647
so we can look close by. Before the sun sets...

243
00:09:34.647 --> 00:09:35.787
(Roy is saying everything I was going to.)

244
00:09:35.787 --> 00:09:38.187
We should find something in the sea.

245
00:09:38.187 --> 00:09:39.758
- Let's... - I'll light a fire first.

246
00:09:39.758 --> 00:09:42.427
Da Rae, you can survey the area.

247
00:09:42.427 --> 00:09:45.027
- We'll build a house... - See if there is anything.

248
00:09:45.968 --> 00:09:46.998
I'll light a fire first.

249
00:09:47.828 --> 00:09:50.067
I'm the Crab Man, so I'll look for crabs.

250
00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:55.108
(Why is Roy moving as soon as the other two are gone?)

251
00:09:55.108 --> 00:09:58.437
There are so many ants, so I think we need to move.

252
00:09:58.708 --> 00:09:59.748
Here...

253
00:10:02.447 --> 00:10:04.517
(He's shocked.)

254
00:10:06.118 --> 00:10:07.388
They are disappearing.

255
00:10:07.388 --> 00:10:09.118
(Bingo)

256
00:10:09.118 --> 00:10:10.787
Why are there less of them here?

257
00:10:12.657 --> 00:10:13.888
(Roy is the real power here.)

258
00:10:13.888 --> 00:10:14.888
This is it.

259
00:10:14.888 --> 00:10:15.897
(Roy is the real power here.)

260
00:10:15.897 --> 00:10:16.897
(He decides to move the shelter.)

261
00:10:16.897 --> 00:10:17.897
There are no bugs here.

262
00:10:19.167 --> 00:10:20.998
Why not? They're right next to each other.

263
00:10:21.797 --> 00:10:22.838
I think this is it.

264
00:10:24.338 --> 00:10:26.307
I didn't know I'd use this.

265
00:10:26.608 --> 00:10:27.638
Inside...

266
00:10:27.638 --> 00:10:29.037
(He even brought a fish trap.)

267
00:10:29.037 --> 00:10:31.608
I need to put in something smelly to attract them.

268
00:10:32.647 --> 00:10:34.177
I don't know what I'd be needing in the jungle.

269
00:10:34.647 --> 00:10:36.517
I'm sure we're going to be catching fish.

270
00:10:36.947 --> 00:10:40.287
Byung Man makes his own fish net,

271
00:10:40.687 --> 00:10:43.618
but I don't have that kind of talent so I bought one.

272
00:10:44.258 --> 00:10:45.588
Are there clams?

273
00:10:45.588 --> 00:10:46.787
(He's prepared to survive.)

274
00:10:47.527 --> 00:10:50.157
Maybe I can crush them and put it in here.

275
00:10:50.157 --> 00:10:51.157
(He has a solid plan.)

276
00:10:51.157 --> 00:10:53.067
Fish might smell the intestines and come.

277
00:10:53.767 --> 00:10:54.868
(He has one weakness.)

278
00:10:54.868 --> 00:10:55.937
They'll slide in like this.

279
00:10:56.838 --> 00:10:59.968
(He sometimes loses his mind.)

280
00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:04.338
(It's ugly Roy Kim again.)

281
00:11:04.338 --> 00:11:07.177
- This is great. - What's this?

282
00:11:07.447 --> 00:11:08.917
- That's good. - It's useful.

283
00:11:09.118 --> 00:11:10.118
Inside this...

284
00:11:11.317 --> 00:11:14.287
Once they go in, they can't get out.

285
00:11:14.287 --> 00:11:16.287
- Right. - For that to be possible,

286
00:11:17.118 --> 00:11:19.828
we need to catch something small like clams...

287
00:11:19.828 --> 00:11:21.888
and crush them. They'll smell the intestines.

288
00:11:21.888 --> 00:11:23.858
- Is this where the bait goes? - Yes, it goes there.

289
00:11:23.858 --> 00:11:26.098
Shall we look for some intestines?

290
00:11:26.098 --> 00:11:28.527
- It's quite useful. - Let's put it in now.

291
00:11:28.527 --> 00:11:29.598
- Okay. - Let's put in the intestines.

292
00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:30.697
(Are there going to be gastropods?)

293
00:11:30.697 --> 00:11:32.307
Catch small gastropods here.

294
00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:34.008
(I can't just stand around.)

295
00:11:34.208 --> 00:11:36.037
There are a lot of crabs...

296
00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:38.608
between the cracks.

297
00:11:38.608 --> 00:11:39.647
- Really? - Yes.

298
00:11:39.647 --> 00:11:41.407
- Are they big? - They're around this big.

299
00:11:41.407 --> 00:11:43.317
It's slippery. There are so many here.

300
00:11:43.317 --> 00:11:46.187
- There are so many fish. - They are at least this big.

301
00:11:46.187 --> 00:11:47.517
- Let me see. - Really?

302
00:11:47.517 --> 00:11:48.917
- Let me see. - They all ran away.

303
00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:51.718
- I want to see too. Where? - They ran away.

304
00:11:52.527 --> 00:11:54.057
(She glances around.)

305
00:11:54.057 --> 00:11:55.328
- What was it? - Then...

306
00:11:55.328 --> 00:11:57.098
Hold on. Don't move.

307
00:11:57.598 --> 00:11:58.728
(It's a big, red stone crab.)

308
00:11:58.728 --> 00:12:00.167
What's that? You scared me.

309
00:12:00.167 --> 00:12:02.098
(It's time for Dindin to show his skills.)

310
00:12:03.397 --> 00:12:04.937
I'm your Crab...

311
00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:08.208
- What's that? - What?

312
00:12:08.777 --> 00:12:09.978
(It doesn't move.)

313
00:12:10.708 --> 00:12:12.078
I'm your Crab... What's that?

314
00:12:12.078 --> 00:12:13.277
(It startled him.)

315
00:12:13.277 --> 00:12:16.047
(Shaking)

316
00:12:18.317 --> 00:12:19.718
- What's that? - What is that?

317
00:12:19.718 --> 00:12:21.088
What is it?

318
00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:22.517
Hey, what's that?

319
00:12:22.517 --> 00:12:24.088
- It's dried out. - What's that?

320
00:12:24.458 --> 00:12:25.527
(He embarrassed himself.)

321
00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:26.787
That shocked me.

322
00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:27.888
(They can't breathe.)

323
00:12:28.557 --> 00:12:29.998
That was hilarious.

324
00:12:29.998 --> 00:12:31.557
(These are bones.)

325
00:12:32.767 --> 00:12:34.968
That hurt my belly.

326
00:12:34.968 --> 00:12:37.238
- That hurt my belly. - That startled me.

327
00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:40.738
- It dried out. - It did.

328
00:12:41.067 --> 00:12:42.437
How can it die like this?

329
00:12:42.437 --> 00:12:45.238
There are a lot of crabs down there. They're not here.

330
00:12:45.238 --> 00:12:46.248
There are a lot down there.

331
00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:48.078
That startled me.

332
00:12:48.547 --> 00:12:49.917
You startled me.

333
00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:52.218
That scared me. I'm sorry.

334
00:12:52.218 --> 00:12:54.088
They don't have great survival skills,

335
00:12:54.088 --> 00:12:56.458
but these three are entertaining. Good luck to you all.

336
00:12:57.187 --> 00:12:59.657
Meanwhile, Jong Hyuk has a hidden mission...

337
00:12:59.657 --> 00:13:01.828
and he's sailing to the open sea.

338
00:13:01.828 --> 00:13:02.858
(Jong Hyuk is sailing away for a hidden mission.)

339
00:13:02.858 --> 00:13:04.197
(He looks around.)

340
00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:08.197
He looks very nervous.

341
00:13:08.567 --> 00:13:11.067
What kind of a mission is it?

342
00:13:11.797 --> 00:13:13.167
To tell you simply,

343
00:13:14.008 --> 00:13:15.478
I have to feed the sharks.

344
00:13:15.478 --> 00:13:16.907
(He has to feed the sharks.)

345
00:13:18.407 --> 00:13:21.378
Sharks are the biggest predators of the sea.

346
00:13:21.378 --> 00:13:22.378
(Sharks are the strongest creatures in the water.)

347
00:13:22.378 --> 00:13:24.547
They look fearsome with their huge bodies...

348
00:13:24.878 --> 00:13:26.388
and sharp teeth.

349
00:13:26.787 --> 00:13:29.317
They sometimes even attack humans.

350
00:13:29.858 --> 00:13:31.958
He has to feed them?

351
00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:34.258
There are various types of sharks...

352
00:13:34.258 --> 00:13:36.828
inhabiting the neighboring seashore.

353
00:13:37.228 --> 00:13:39.728
When people usually feed them,

354
00:13:39.728 --> 00:13:41.797
they go in a cage.

355
00:13:41.998 --> 00:13:44.767
But there are no cages here?

356
00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:48.437
It's a challenging mission where he has to feed the sharks...

357
00:13:48.437 --> 00:13:49.578
with his hands.

358
00:13:50.138 --> 00:13:52.547
Will he be able to see the sharks in front of him...

359
00:13:52.547 --> 00:13:54.848
as in the movie "Jaws"?

360
00:13:57.218 --> 00:13:59.317
Jong Hyuk, we wish you luck.

361
00:13:59.317 --> 00:14:00.647
(He's in charge of Byung Man's mission...)

362
00:14:00.647 --> 00:14:01.988
(since he's a certified diver.)

363
00:14:01.988 --> 00:14:04.258
Come in this way.

364
00:14:04.417 --> 00:14:06.258
You have to follow this line...

365
00:14:06.258 --> 00:14:08.458
all the way to the end. I'll be with you down there.

366
00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:10.828
- Follow this line. - Yes. Follow this line.

367
00:14:10.828 --> 00:14:11.858
Right?

368
00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:15.667
(Jong Hyuk looks very nervous.)

369
00:14:15.667 --> 00:14:17.037
I'd be lying if I said I'm not scared.

370
00:14:17.968 --> 00:14:20.138
I don't know. Who won't be scared?

371
00:14:22.238 --> 00:14:25.647
(He tries to act calm.)

372
00:14:25.647 --> 00:14:27.147
(Sighing)

373
00:14:27.848 --> 00:14:33.888
(He stays calm as he gets ready.)

374
00:14:35.017 --> 00:14:36.057
Are you ready?

375
00:14:36.657 --> 00:14:38.657
Yes.

376
00:14:38.657 --> 00:14:39.828
I don't know.

377
00:14:39.828 --> 00:14:41.588
(He keeps sighing.)

378
00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:43.098
(Do you think you can do it?)

379
00:14:43.098 --> 00:14:45.258
Yes... I'm nervous.

380
00:14:45.258 --> 00:14:47.498
(He usually doesn't get nervous.)

381
00:14:57.338 --> 00:14:58.608
See you later.

382
00:15:01.078 --> 00:15:05.748
(He overcomes his fear and dives in the water.)

383
00:15:05.748 --> 00:15:08.817
(Here comes the jungle veteran.)

384
00:15:11.157 --> 00:15:13.828
(He holds on to the rope and descends smoothly.)

385
00:15:13.828 --> 00:15:15.697
(He starts diving.)

386
00:15:15.697 --> 00:15:20.527
(He looks for sharks...)

387
00:15:20.527 --> 00:15:24.437
(somewhere deep within...)

388
00:15:24.437 --> 00:15:29.878
(the quiet sea.)

389
00:15:29.878 --> 00:15:32.478
(He keeps on descending.)

390
00:15:32.478 --> 00:15:37.578
(He reaches the 25m point.)

391
00:15:37.578 --> 00:15:42.388
(Shark feeding is done at 25 to 30m level where sharks inhabit.)

392
00:15:42.388 --> 00:15:47.057
(You must be a certified diver and receive safety training.)

393
00:15:48.128 --> 00:15:50.258
(Are the sharks not here yet?)

394
00:15:50.258 --> 00:15:52.067
(Please follow me.)

395
00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:53.868
(Okay, I'll come.)

396
00:15:56.267 --> 00:16:00.508
(Jong Hyuk follows the expert.)

397
00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:05.907
(There's the fear of the unknown...)

398
00:16:05.907 --> 00:16:11.677
(but without the Chief, he stepped up to represent the Tribe.)

399
00:16:12.047 --> 00:16:16.758
(What will he see?)

400
00:16:20.287 --> 00:16:26.128
(There are hundreds of fish in the sea.)

401
00:16:30.397 --> 00:16:33.338
It was awesome.

402
00:16:33.608 --> 00:16:34.907
At that moment,

403
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:36.578
I relaxed.

404
00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:38.978
(He relaxes over the splendid sight in front of him.)

405
00:16:39.578 --> 00:16:43.277
(Jong Hyuk's camera)

406
00:16:44.118 --> 00:16:46.088
(Come here. Let's play.)

407
00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:49.817
(This is unbelievable.)

408
00:16:58.228 --> 00:17:00.397
(He looks around.)

409
00:17:00.397 --> 00:17:02.737
(Where are the sharks?)

410
00:17:04.868 --> 00:17:07.868
(Is this a puzzle game?)

411
00:17:10.177 --> 00:17:13.177
(The expert takes position.)

412
00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:21.588
(He opens the box with food in it.)

413
00:17:23.687 --> 00:17:27.727
(There aren't even sharp fins anywhere.)

414
00:17:32.028 --> 00:17:35.768
(Would he have to go back up without seeing any sharks?)

415
00:17:38.138 --> 00:17:39.138
(At that moment)

416
00:17:39.138 --> 00:17:40.207
(What is that gigantic creature?)

417
00:17:40.207 --> 00:17:42.808
(It's a shark.)

418
00:17:43.007 --> 00:17:46.177
(It finally shows itself.)

419
00:17:48.977 --> 00:17:51.278
(His eyes open wide.)

420
00:17:52.247 --> 00:17:54.717
(It's a shark.)

421
00:17:59.457 --> 00:18:04.957
(The sharks swim amongst other fish.)

422
00:18:05.098 --> 00:18:08.167
(It looks ginormous even from far away.)

423
00:18:11.667 --> 00:18:15.578
(He tenses up again.)

424
00:18:18.078 --> 00:18:19.308
The sharks...

425
00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:21.477
(It's not just one. A swarm of sharks come near them.)

426
00:18:21.477 --> 00:18:23.247
I don't know what kind of sharks they are,

427
00:18:23.247 --> 00:18:27.687
but it was pitch dark at that water depth.

428
00:18:27.917 --> 00:18:29.318
There were sharks swarming about.

429
00:18:29.618 --> 00:18:33.828
(They are the frightening creatures seen in films.)

430
00:18:34.927 --> 00:18:37.298
(Shivering)

431
00:18:37.657 --> 00:18:40.167
(Will Jong Hyuk be able to complete the mission?)

432
00:18:40.528 --> 00:18:41.768
This is nice.

433
00:18:41.768 --> 00:18:42.798
(Sung Hoon's team arrives by the fall.)

434
00:18:42.798 --> 00:18:43.798
Listen to that.

435
00:18:45.038 --> 00:18:46.108
(Exclaiming)

436
00:18:47.838 --> 00:18:49.308
This is amazing, Sung Hoon.

437
00:18:49.308 --> 00:18:51.177
(They are amazed by the Mother Nature.)

438
00:18:51.177 --> 00:18:52.177
This is amazing.

439
00:18:53.647 --> 00:18:56.177
(At the end of Navua River is a beautiful scenery.)

440
00:18:56.618 --> 00:18:57.618
It's so refreshing.

441
00:18:57.618 --> 00:18:58.618
(At the end of Navua River is a beautiful scenery.)

442
00:18:59.987 --> 00:19:02.288
(It's even more splendid close up.)

443
00:19:04.058 --> 00:19:05.088
(His jaws drop.)

444
00:19:05.088 --> 00:19:06.128
This is no joke.

445
00:19:06.628 --> 00:19:08.657
Doesn't it feel like we turned on a giant humidifier?

446
00:19:09.128 --> 00:19:10.427
How deep do you think this is?

447
00:19:10.427 --> 00:19:11.757
(The water falls at 40m height.)

448
00:19:11.757 --> 00:19:13.967
Look. This is no joke.

449
00:19:13.997 --> 00:19:17.638
(The water falls majestically.)

450
00:19:17.638 --> 00:19:18.838
(It's nature's humidifier.)

451
00:19:18.838 --> 00:19:19.907
It's refreshing.

452
00:19:21.308 --> 00:19:23.138
Isn't this the biggest fall you've seen?

453
00:19:23.677 --> 00:19:24.808
It is.

454
00:19:25.237 --> 00:19:28.247
We have to go under a fall like this.

455
00:19:28.247 --> 00:19:29.848
That's what we do.

456
00:19:30.848 --> 00:19:32.647
- Isn't it close? - It is.

457
00:19:32.647 --> 00:19:33.888
Should we walk up to it?

458
00:19:34.018 --> 00:19:36.818
Is it dangerous to go under it?

459
00:19:36.818 --> 00:19:37.957
It's not.

460
00:19:37.957 --> 00:19:40.028
It's stronger on top.

461
00:19:40.028 --> 00:19:43.427
We can't go there, but we can go to the bottom.

462
00:19:43.858 --> 00:19:46.368
- It looks strong too. - No, we can do it.

463
00:19:46.467 --> 00:19:48.298
- We can do it. - We can really do it.

464
00:19:48.528 --> 00:19:51.437
- Can you do it? - I can. I'm certain.

465
00:19:51.437 --> 00:19:52.467
- Are you sure? - Yes.

466
00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:54.308
- You can go first. - Please go first.

467
00:19:54.308 --> 00:19:56.437
Should I? Let's try it. It's going to be so refreshing.

468
00:19:56.437 --> 00:19:57.507
Are you sure?

469
00:19:59.378 --> 00:20:01.378
This is amazing.

470
00:20:01.578 --> 00:20:03.247
We're going to stand under the fall.

471
00:20:03.778 --> 00:20:05.048
You can do it.

472
00:20:05.048 --> 00:20:06.417
Choo Sung Hoon!

473
00:20:06.417 --> 00:20:08.957
- Choo Sung Hoon! - Choo Sung Hoon!

474
00:20:10.318 --> 00:20:11.618
Sa Rang is watching.

475
00:20:11.618 --> 00:20:12.657
(Sa Rang, I'll be back.)

476
00:20:12.657 --> 00:20:14.487
- "Let's go, Daddy." - "Let's go, Daddy."

477
00:20:14.487 --> 00:20:15.558
Let's go.

478
00:20:16.227 --> 00:20:17.558
(This is a dad's power.)

479
00:20:17.558 --> 00:20:19.497
- You can do it. - Let's go.

480
00:20:19.497 --> 00:20:21.197
(He walks towards the giant fall.)

481
00:20:21.197 --> 00:20:23.038
- Be careful. - Be careful.

482
00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:24.237
You can do it.

483
00:20:26.967 --> 00:20:28.007
He's going.

484
00:20:28.007 --> 00:20:29.007
(Let's go, Chief Choo.)

485
00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:32.447
(Sung Hoon looks tiny in front of the falls.)

486
00:20:34.007 --> 00:20:35.947
(Welcome to a 40m fall.)

487
00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.647
(Here he goes.)

488
00:20:39.647 --> 00:20:40.647
(Swaying)

489
00:20:40.647 --> 00:20:42.217
(The strong water current makes him sway.)

490
00:20:42.217 --> 00:20:43.588
(He keeps on going.)

491
00:20:44.888 --> 00:20:47.828
(The water pressure is high and it's quite windy.)

492
00:20:50.528 --> 00:20:52.098
(Let's go, Chief Choo.)

493
00:20:53.798 --> 00:20:55.897
(Will he be able to...)

494
00:20:55.897 --> 00:20:58.167
(go under the rough falls?)

495
00:21:00.737 --> 00:21:02.407
(He's nervous.)

496
00:21:04.778 --> 00:21:06.707
(I am...)

497
00:21:06.707 --> 00:21:09.818
(Choo Sung Hoon.)

498
00:21:10.417 --> 00:21:12.987
(He gets past the rough water current...)

499
00:21:12.987 --> 00:21:14.588
(and enters the falls.)

500
00:21:14.588 --> 00:21:16.358
(Chief Choo made it.)

501
00:21:17.858 --> 00:21:19.657
(He's amazing.)

502
00:21:20.687 --> 00:21:21.727
Come in.

503
00:21:22.328 --> 00:21:24.628
(Underneath the falls is...)

504
00:21:24.727 --> 00:21:27.197
(a small space.)

505
00:21:28.197 --> 00:21:30.497
(He feels refreshed.)

506
00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:33.538
It's great.

507
00:21:34.608 --> 00:21:36.407
(Inside the giant waterfall is...)

508
00:21:36.407 --> 00:21:39.778
(a totally different world.)

509
00:21:39.778 --> 00:21:42.548
(He determines to survive.)

510
00:21:46.788 --> 00:21:48.518
(I can do anything now.)

511
00:21:49.257 --> 00:21:51.018
It's a different world in here.

512
00:21:54.227 --> 00:21:55.457
This is great.

513
00:21:55.457 --> 00:21:57.227
(There's a circular rainbow that the falls created.)

514
00:21:59.967 --> 00:22:02.967
(It's a special experience of a lifetime.)

515
00:22:05.038 --> 00:22:06.108
Now...

516
00:22:06.108 --> 00:22:09.338
(He gets back to the outside.)

517
00:22:11.937 --> 00:22:15.677
(He takes caution not to slip.)

518
00:22:16.477 --> 00:22:18.717
- Sung Hoon. - There's a rainbow.

519
00:22:18.818 --> 00:22:20.747
- What? - There's a rainbow.

520
00:22:20.747 --> 00:22:23.457
- Right? - Rainbows...

521
00:22:23.457 --> 00:22:26.528
are supposed to be circular.

522
00:22:26.528 --> 00:22:28.487
- It's not a semi-circle? - It's not.

523
00:22:28.487 --> 00:22:30.497
It's supposed to be circular.

524
00:22:30.757 --> 00:22:32.368
You can see it there.

525
00:22:32.368 --> 00:22:33.528
(There's a circular rainbow in front of the waterfall.)

526
00:22:33.927 --> 00:22:35.397
- Let's go. - Let's go.

527
00:22:35.397 --> 00:22:37.868
Let's stand under the falls and take its energy...

528
00:22:37.868 --> 00:22:40.068
for a great day.

529
00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:41.437
- You can do it. - I'll go.

530
00:22:43.808 --> 00:22:44.937
(Let's go, Woo Jin.)

531
00:22:46.407 --> 00:22:47.907
(Chief Noh heads towards the falls.)

532
00:22:47.907 --> 00:22:49.247
Let's go.

533
00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:53.848
(Exclaiming)

534
00:22:55.518 --> 00:22:58.487
(He keeps on exclaiming.)

535
00:22:59.558 --> 00:23:01.257
I'm scared.

536
00:23:01.257 --> 00:23:02.298
(He's scared but he'll do it.)

537
00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:04.298
I'm scared.

538
00:23:04.927 --> 00:23:05.997
You can do it.

539
00:23:05.997 --> 00:23:06.997
(Show us what you've got.)

540
00:23:07.768 --> 00:23:08.798
(I can do it.)

541
00:23:08.798 --> 00:23:11.568
The Law of Jungle.

542
00:23:11.568 --> 00:23:12.638
(He chants "The Law of Jungle".)

543
00:23:12.638 --> 00:23:16.237
(The waterfall is waiting for me.)

544
00:23:16.237 --> 00:23:18.878
(This is The Law of Jungle.)

545
00:23:19.477 --> 00:23:20.747
It's so cold.

546
00:23:22.417 --> 00:23:23.677
(Falling)

547
00:23:23.677 --> 00:23:26.217
(The water keeps on coming.)

548
00:23:27.647 --> 00:23:30.717
(He has to get past it.)

549
00:23:33.858 --> 00:23:36.628
(The cameraman is struggling too.)

550
00:23:40.197 --> 00:23:42.897
I'm dazed. It wakes me up.

551
00:23:42.897 --> 00:23:44.068
(You look dazed.)

552
00:23:44.568 --> 00:23:46.467
It's so refreshing.

553
00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:47.907
(I belong to the jungle.)

554
00:23:50.707 --> 00:23:51.838
You did it.

555
00:23:51.838 --> 00:23:53.147
(We respect you, Chief Noh.)

556
00:23:54.977 --> 00:23:57.518
(He does it like a man and slides down carefully.)

557
00:23:58.417 --> 00:24:00.318
- It's no joke. - Is it nice?

558
00:24:00.588 --> 00:24:01.888
It woke me up.

559
00:24:01.888 --> 00:24:02.888
(Try it for yourself.)

560
00:24:02.888 --> 00:24:04.388
It's a different world.

561
00:24:04.388 --> 00:24:05.427
(It makes you forget about the reality.)

562
00:24:05.687 --> 00:24:06.858
It wakes you up.

563
00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:08.227
- Is it refreshing? - Yes.

564
00:24:08.227 --> 00:24:09.497
- Go. - Shall I?

565
00:24:09.497 --> 00:24:10.497
You can do it.

566
00:24:10.858 --> 00:24:12.128
You can go together.

567
00:24:12.128 --> 00:24:13.328
(Chae Kyung and Jae Hyun give it a try.)

568
00:24:15.368 --> 00:24:16.598
It's slippery.

569
00:24:18.808 --> 00:24:19.838
I'm cold already.

570
00:24:20.967 --> 00:24:23.278
(The cute idol stars...)

571
00:24:23.278 --> 00:24:25.848
(approach the falls.)

572
00:24:25.848 --> 00:24:27.677
It looks like a scene from a film.

573
00:24:28.348 --> 00:24:29.647
It looks like a scene from a film.

574
00:24:32.118 --> 00:24:33.187
It's so slippery.

575
00:24:33.917 --> 00:24:36.318
(They rely on each other and take small steps.)

576
00:24:40.558 --> 00:24:43.457
It looks like "Love Story".

577
00:24:43.457 --> 00:24:45.798
- It looks nice. - They are the main characters.

578
00:24:46.098 --> 00:24:48.268
They'll go inside the falls...

579
00:24:50.397 --> 00:24:51.967
(Screaming)

580
00:24:52.237 --> 00:24:54.237
(What on earth is happening to them?)

581
00:24:54.437 --> 00:24:55.507
The waterfall is so strong.

582
00:24:57.138 --> 00:24:59.007
(Unable to endure the waterfall,)

583
00:24:59.007 --> 00:25:00.707
(these two have fallen.)

584
00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:01.878
(Gosh, this waterfall is no joke.)

585
00:25:03.177 --> 00:25:04.217
Be careful.

586
00:25:05.118 --> 00:25:06.147
(He's worried.)

587
00:25:07.318 --> 00:25:08.717
(Chae Kyung gets up as she helps Jae Hyun up.)

588
00:25:08.717 --> 00:25:11.388
- Hey, this is so strong. - This is no joke.

589
00:25:11.487 --> 00:25:12.828
- The waterfall is too rough. - Be careful!

590
00:25:12.828 --> 00:25:13.987
Let me go before you.

591
00:25:15.957 --> 00:25:16.957
Hey!

592
00:25:16.957 --> 00:25:18.397
(Jae Hyun walks into the waterfall first.)

593
00:25:18.397 --> 00:25:20.427
- Hey, this is too strong. - I can't see.

594
00:25:21.697 --> 00:25:22.737
I can't see you.

595
00:25:22.737 --> 00:25:23.737
(Chae Kyung can't penetrate into the waterfall.)

596
00:25:24.038 --> 00:25:25.538
Chae Kyung, you can do this!

597
00:25:25.667 --> 00:25:26.707
- Go for it! - Okay.

598
00:25:27.308 --> 00:25:30.308
(Jae Hyun reaches out his arm for Chae Kyung.)

599
00:25:30.578 --> 00:25:34.407
(With the help of Jae Hyun,)

600
00:25:34.407 --> 00:25:36.647
(she walks into the waterfall penetrating a shroud of water.)

601
00:25:40.318 --> 00:25:41.318
This is incredible.

602
00:25:41.318 --> 00:25:42.318
(Now that they're inside,)

603
00:25:42.318 --> 00:25:44.788
(it truly looks like a scene from a film.)

604
00:25:46.187 --> 00:25:47.187
Chae Kyung!

605
00:25:47.528 --> 00:25:48.727
Jae Hyun!

606
00:25:49.528 --> 00:25:50.657
You looked so cool!

607
00:25:55.098 --> 00:25:57.138
(They naturally break into laughter inside the waterfall.)

608
00:25:59.737 --> 00:26:00.737
It's amazing in here.

609
00:26:02.138 --> 00:26:04.437
(Jae Hyun is full of smiles.)

610
00:26:04.838 --> 00:26:06.778
(Chae Kyung looks innocent.)

611
00:26:06.977 --> 00:26:08.247
It's so refreshing though.

612
00:26:08.247 --> 00:26:10.118
(They're a good-looking couple straight out of a comic book.)

613
00:26:13.618 --> 00:26:15.818
- It's way better than I imagined. - It is indeed.

614
00:26:16.318 --> 00:26:17.318
It's so strong.

615
00:26:17.318 --> 00:26:20.957
(Worries disappear inside the waterfall during that moment.)

616
00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:26.328
(It'll certainly be an unforgettable memory for these two youngsters.)

617
00:26:29.497 --> 00:26:31.467
- How are we going to get out? - I was thinking the same.

618
00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:36.207
(Let's venture out for our survival now.)

619
00:26:38.977 --> 00:26:39.977
Hold this.

620
00:26:39.977 --> 00:26:41.548
(It's special time to relax...)

621
00:26:41.548 --> 00:26:43.247
(only the jungle can provide.)

622
00:26:43.247 --> 00:26:46.247
- Let's go! 1, 2. - 1, 2.

623
00:26:46.247 --> 00:26:48.048
(They jump into the waterfall since it's a once-in-a-life-time chance.)

624
00:26:49.358 --> 00:26:50.957
(Making a fuss)

625
00:26:50.957 --> 00:26:52.028
This is amazing!

626
00:26:52.028 --> 00:26:55.187
(They are just like little kids playing with water.)

627
00:26:55.628 --> 00:26:57.227
Hey, stop. No! Don't do it.

628
00:26:57.227 --> 00:27:01.227
When I was there, I felt all my burden has been lifted.

629
00:27:01.227 --> 00:27:03.568
It was so refreshing. I loved it.

630
00:27:03.997 --> 00:27:06.338
When I saw the water falling down from the top,

631
00:27:06.407 --> 00:27:10.108
all the trouble I've been having was gone.

632
00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:11.677
I was genuinely happy.

633
00:27:13.477 --> 00:27:17.747
I felt as if the waterfall was poured inside my body.

634
00:27:18.147 --> 00:27:19.747
It felt cool and refreshing.

635
00:27:20.647 --> 00:27:23.487
At least for that moment, I forgot about how hard this survival was.

636
00:27:23.487 --> 00:27:25.888
I just thought it was like a scene from a film.

637
00:27:26.588 --> 00:27:28.088
(A scene from an action film?)

638
00:27:28.588 --> 00:27:30.997
I've never seen such a huge waterfall as this one.

639
00:27:31.128 --> 00:27:32.997
So I truly enjoyed it.

640
00:27:34.298 --> 00:27:36.638
A part of me wants to show the waterfall to my daughter...

641
00:27:36.638 --> 00:27:39.338
to prove her that I've been to such a huge waterfall as this one.

642
00:27:39.338 --> 00:27:43.308
(When my daughter grows up, I want to bring her here.)

643
00:27:43.338 --> 00:27:45.848
After they experience the waterfall shower, they dive into the water.

644
00:27:45.848 --> 00:27:47.348
(They dive 4m above the ground.)

645
00:27:47.348 --> 00:27:50.078
They put behind their struggling moments of the survival briefly.

646
00:27:50.247 --> 00:27:52.987
The Tribe loses themselves into the nature.

647
00:27:53.687 --> 00:27:58.018
Isn't it the best way to relax which is only available in the jungle?

648
00:27:58.657 --> 00:28:00.828
With this cold water shower, they're more eager to survive in the jungle.

649
00:28:01.028 --> 00:28:03.457
Anyhow, you should start your survival now.

650
00:28:05.227 --> 00:28:07.528
Goodness, look. So many things are stuck over there.

651
00:28:07.528 --> 00:28:09.467
I think we're going to have a feast today.

652
00:28:11.098 --> 00:28:12.338
Isn't that too small?

653
00:28:12.338 --> 00:28:14.268
- We should gather a lot of this. - Okay.

654
00:28:14.308 --> 00:28:15.707
(Roy and Da Rae are looking for bait for the fish trap.)

655
00:28:15.838 --> 00:28:17.808
And then we can crack them with rocks.

656
00:28:18.007 --> 00:28:19.747
- Food is inside. - I see.

657
00:28:24.147 --> 00:28:25.888
Let's keep them. We have nothing to lose.

658
00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:28.048
But how are we going to take the inside out?

659
00:28:28.048 --> 00:28:30.687
- We can crack it. - If we have a thin wire,

660
00:28:31.318 --> 00:28:33.288
we can poke the inside and get it out.

661
00:28:33.288 --> 00:28:35.628
- But we don't have a wire. - We can find or make one.

662
00:28:37.128 --> 00:28:38.298
- Let's go. - Let's go.

663
00:28:38.528 --> 00:28:39.568
Let's go and take them out.

664
00:28:40.197 --> 00:28:41.197
Let's crack them.

665
00:28:41.227 --> 00:28:42.397
(They return to the base camp after gathering bait.)

666
00:28:43.197 --> 00:28:44.868
(They have to prepare the gastropods.)

667
00:28:44.868 --> 00:28:46.308
Do we have a big rock?

668
00:28:46.437 --> 00:28:48.737
Do we have some kind of board? Hold on.

669
00:28:48.737 --> 00:28:50.737
(Roy runs to the opposite side of the beach.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

670
00:28:50.737 --> 00:28:52.477
(He picks up a plank, drifted to the beach.)

671
00:28:53.207 --> 00:28:54.848
(I think this will do it.)

672
00:28:56.217 --> 00:28:57.217
With this rock...

673
00:28:58.378 --> 00:29:05.927
(He makes a cutting board using the the board and rocks for gastropods.)

674
00:29:07.457 --> 00:29:08.487
Nice job.

675
00:29:08.487 --> 00:29:09.697
(This smart guy gets better at surviving.)

676
00:29:10.897 --> 00:29:13.828
(Meanwhile, Dindin is searching for crabs overcoming dead crabs.)

677
00:29:13.828 --> 00:29:15.967
I think we can sleep here.

678
00:29:16.768 --> 00:29:18.138
(The arch-shaped cave is cozy and comfortable.)

679
00:29:18.138 --> 00:29:19.368
It's so warm in here.

680
00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:21.207
Why is it warm in here?

681
00:29:21.207 --> 00:29:22.338
What if the water floods back in?

682
00:29:22.338 --> 00:29:23.677
You're right. I'll be dead.

683
00:29:24.338 --> 00:29:25.778
But it's so warm in here.

684
00:29:26.048 --> 00:29:29.278
I think it's warm because the sun beamed at it directly.

685
00:29:29.278 --> 00:29:30.348
(If only there were no tides...)

686
00:29:30.348 --> 00:29:31.747
Gosh, how can this be so warm?

687
00:29:31.747 --> 00:29:34.747
That's a field swarming with crabs. There are tons.

688
00:29:34.848 --> 00:29:35.858
Don't you agree?

689
00:29:36.487 --> 00:29:38.187
The crabs are going somewhere.

690
00:29:38.187 --> 00:29:39.828
I have to study their routes.

691
00:29:41.828 --> 00:29:44.397
The crabs are heading that way.

692
00:29:46.328 --> 00:29:48.368
Why are they gathering over there?

693
00:29:49.838 --> 00:29:50.937
(He might end up going into the water.)

694
00:29:50.937 --> 00:29:52.038
Why are they coming here?

695
00:29:52.937 --> 00:29:55.677
Guys, why are you assembling here?

696
00:29:55.677 --> 00:29:56.808
Tell me.

697
00:29:57.308 --> 00:30:00.477
Okay. This is the spot. This is like the apartment complex.

698
00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:01.647
There are so many crabs here.

699
00:30:03.848 --> 00:30:05.747
I see. All the crabs are right here.

700
00:30:06.588 --> 00:30:07.848
There are so many here.

701
00:30:08.318 --> 00:30:09.318
Look.

702
00:30:10.457 --> 00:30:11.457
That crab is quite big.

703
00:30:11.457 --> 00:30:13.328
(The crabs are busy running away at the sight of Dindin.)

704
00:30:14.028 --> 00:30:16.157
This is a prime location.

705
00:30:17.098 --> 00:30:19.727
I should come back during dinner when they come out.

706
00:30:19.727 --> 00:30:20.727
(He only checks the spot for now.)

707
00:30:20.727 --> 00:30:22.237
I should come back when they're moving.

708
00:30:22.868 --> 00:30:25.167
- Hey, I found it. - What did you find?

709
00:30:25.538 --> 00:30:27.737
I found the gathering place the crabs reside in.

710
00:30:28.237 --> 00:30:30.378
When they sleep, we can hunt over there.

711
00:30:30.538 --> 00:30:31.578
Is this our base camp?

712
00:30:31.638 --> 00:30:34.308
- Yes, that's it. - How are we going to build a house?

713
00:30:34.747 --> 00:30:36.747
Hey, we have to make a fire first. Dindin.

714
00:30:36.878 --> 00:30:39.348
- After spending time here, - Fire comes first?

715
00:30:39.348 --> 00:30:40.788
fire is more important than a shelter.

716
00:30:41.018 --> 00:30:42.917
- Let's make a fire then. - In order for us to do so...

717
00:30:43.487 --> 00:30:44.518
What do we have to do?

718
00:30:44.558 --> 00:30:45.927
(The roles are reversed.)

719
00:30:45.957 --> 00:30:47.528
If you can bring me these firewoods...

720
00:30:47.528 --> 00:30:49.558
- Okay, okay. I got it. - Use this.

721
00:30:49.558 --> 00:30:50.798
Wasn't I the Chief?

722
00:30:51.628 --> 00:30:53.598
(It seems the roles have been reversed.)

723
00:30:53.598 --> 00:30:55.068
Roy, this isn't working.

724
00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:56.697
It won't come out at all.

725
00:30:58.538 --> 00:31:00.038
(Something is definitely wrong.)

726
00:31:00.038 --> 00:31:01.538
With what can we make a fire?

727
00:31:02.937 --> 00:31:04.038
What will burn?

728
00:31:04.378 --> 00:31:06.548
We have to make this clear. I'm the Chief, right?

729
00:31:06.548 --> 00:31:07.548
(He provokes Roy.)

730
00:31:08.048 --> 00:31:09.747
- Of course, you are. - I knew it, right?

731
00:31:09.747 --> 00:31:11.118
- Yes. - Should I bring the firewoods?

732
00:31:11.118 --> 00:31:12.947
- Yes, please. - I'm on it.

733
00:31:14.588 --> 00:31:17.217
(I hope I was the Chief)

734
00:31:17.217 --> 00:31:20.358
(Well, we need the firewoods anyway.)

735
00:31:20.558 --> 00:31:23.028
(The mixed fates of these two Chiefs)

736
00:31:24.757 --> 00:31:27.128
(He tries to build his achievements as the Chief.)

737
00:31:27.128 --> 00:31:28.868
But the ground here is weird.

738
00:31:29.737 --> 00:31:32.937
There are so many dry trees.

739
00:31:32.937 --> 00:31:35.308
Get all of them. We need them for our fuel.

740
00:31:35.937 --> 00:31:38.848
I'm the Chief, but why do I feel like I'm being instructed?

741
00:31:41.677 --> 00:31:42.818
There has to be something here.

742
00:31:42.848 --> 00:31:43.848
(Meanwhile, Da Rae goes to the other side of the beach.)

743
00:31:43.848 --> 00:31:45.947
I saw some things where the water wasn't deep.

744
00:31:48.987 --> 00:31:51.417
These are better than nothing.

745
00:31:52.388 --> 00:31:53.727
Let's take them.

746
00:31:54.588 --> 00:31:56.427
If we literally have nothing to eat later,

747
00:31:56.457 --> 00:31:57.927
I should go into the water.

748
00:31:58.727 --> 00:32:01.897
When I go in at night,

749
00:32:02.967 --> 00:32:05.167
it'd be easier to catch fish...

750
00:32:05.838 --> 00:32:08.737
since the fish swim slower at night compared to the afternoon.

751
00:32:10.038 --> 00:32:12.548
(Look forward to the gold medalist's hunting at night.)

752
00:32:12.548 --> 00:32:13.578
What is this?

753
00:32:18.548 --> 00:32:19.647
It's a clam.

754
00:32:19.647 --> 00:32:21.147
Should I just pull out the whole tree?

755
00:32:21.147 --> 00:32:22.888
(Meanwhile, Dindin is still looking for firewoods.)

756
00:32:22.888 --> 00:32:25.088
(Can't I be the Chief?)

757
00:32:25.088 --> 00:32:26.628
(Complaining)

758
00:32:26.628 --> 00:32:28.528
(In this lifetime)

759
00:32:28.558 --> 00:32:30.727
(Then can I be the Chief in my next life?)

760
00:32:30.727 --> 00:32:31.927
Where should I start the fire?

761
00:32:32.768 --> 00:32:34.798
Roy, I think it will be easy to start a fire.

762
00:32:34.927 --> 00:32:36.798
The trees are all dried up.

763
00:32:37.838 --> 00:32:38.868
They are incredible.

764
00:32:38.868 --> 00:32:39.937
(King Roy enters.)

765
00:32:39.937 --> 00:32:42.638
We picked the good spot. It's right next to a dead tree.

766
00:32:42.977 --> 00:32:45.207
We can light the fire right here.

767
00:32:46.578 --> 00:32:48.608
(He feels small whenever he faces Roy.)

768
00:32:48.608 --> 00:32:49.747
What is this? Is this poop?

769
00:32:50.048 --> 00:32:51.647
- I think it's... - Whose poop is this?

770
00:32:51.747 --> 00:32:52.888
Doesn't it look like a goat's?

771
00:32:52.888 --> 00:32:55.147
- Right? - Why is it here? It's upsetting.

772
00:32:55.147 --> 00:32:57.058
I don't want to touch it with my hands.

773
00:32:57.058 --> 00:32:59.588
The poop is the proof that animals are living here.

774
00:32:59.588 --> 00:33:02.028
No, it means that animals just poop here...

775
00:33:02.028 --> 00:33:03.128
where we'll sleep.

776
00:33:04.598 --> 00:33:06.697
(Roy, I'm the Chief.)

777
00:33:07.328 --> 00:33:08.697
(He has the absolute power.)

778
00:33:09.437 --> 00:33:11.038
I think the fire will be quite big.

779
00:33:11.038 --> 00:33:12.467
(Dindin has been trying to stay sane,)

780
00:33:12.467 --> 00:33:14.068
(but his attempt is a complete failure.)

781
00:33:14.538 --> 00:33:16.477
I'm going to light the fire at my first try.

782
00:33:16.477 --> 00:33:17.677
(Roy is ready to start a fire.)

783
00:33:17.677 --> 00:33:18.947
(It sparks right away.)

784
00:33:18.947 --> 00:33:19.947
Sweet!

785
00:33:20.207 --> 00:33:23.217
If I get all the trees around here, we'll have enough firewoods.

786
00:33:23.217 --> 00:33:24.217
(Firewoods are taken care of...)

787
00:33:24.217 --> 00:33:25.987
(and so is the tool thanks to Roy.)

788
00:33:26.848 --> 00:33:30.818
But they can make a fire today since they have the fire steel, right?

789
00:33:31.917 --> 00:33:35.558
On the other hand, the waterfall showers motivate Team Captain.

790
00:33:36.358 --> 00:33:38.828
They're looking around to find a place for their shelter.

791
00:33:38.828 --> 00:33:40.068
We were here earlier.

792
00:33:40.528 --> 00:33:43.467
- This is... - This is the highest spot.

793
00:33:43.467 --> 00:33:45.368
This is the highest spot from the ground.

794
00:33:45.868 --> 00:33:47.538
We can even do our laundry here.

795
00:33:47.838 --> 00:33:49.677
You're right. We can do that.

796
00:33:49.838 --> 00:33:51.507
(It's a clean and open space with a valley flowing by.)

797
00:33:51.507 --> 00:33:53.507
Should we set up here?

798
00:33:53.647 --> 00:33:56.147
- Right here? - If we go into the forest,

799
00:33:56.147 --> 00:33:57.717
- there will be tons of bugs. - That's true.

800
00:33:57.717 --> 00:33:59.747
- He's right. - There will be a lot of bugs.

801
00:33:59.747 --> 00:34:01.548
Let's cut bamboos and spread them out on the floor.

802
00:34:01.548 --> 00:34:03.757
- Should we try that? - We can cover with leaves on top.

803
00:34:03.757 --> 00:34:05.288
We can cut down the trees.

804
00:34:05.358 --> 00:34:06.828
But isn't this the first time...

805
00:34:07.558 --> 00:34:08.857
building a shelter somewhere like this?

806
00:34:08.857 --> 00:34:10.098
- We've never done it. - No one has done it before, right?

807
00:34:10.098 --> 00:34:12.197
- This is the first then. - Not even Byung Man had done it?

808
00:34:12.498 --> 00:34:14.627
Then in this special, we've done a lot of things for the first time.

809
00:34:14.627 --> 00:34:17.337
We slept without a fire. We barely ate.

810
00:34:17.337 --> 00:34:19.038
- It's the first time. - Let's do this too, Sung Hoon.

811
00:34:19.407 --> 00:34:21.308
We can teach the next guests who will appear on the show...

812
00:34:21.308 --> 00:34:23.737
that they shouldn't build a shelter on a place like this.

813
00:34:24.308 --> 00:34:26.148
We can show them that. Should Jae Hyun and I...

814
00:34:26.148 --> 00:34:27.377
go and cut the bamboos?

815
00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:29.418
- All right. - Yes, bring us some bamboos.

816
00:34:29.418 --> 00:34:32.748
You can just cut the bamboos in halves.

817
00:34:33.518 --> 00:34:34.547
The ax.

818
00:34:35.657 --> 00:34:37.918
- That's great. - Great.

819
00:34:37.958 --> 00:34:39.188
We can use our tools, right?

820
00:34:39.427 --> 00:34:41.728
Of course! I brought it all the way here.

821
00:34:42.328 --> 00:34:45.567
I like planning, organizing, and preparing before I go...

822
00:34:45.567 --> 00:34:47.197
on a trip or somewhere.

823
00:34:47.197 --> 00:34:50.038
I've seen the previous episodes.

824
00:34:50.038 --> 00:34:52.138
It seemed I needed a lot of bare essentials.

825
00:34:52.808 --> 00:34:54.567
- Did you buy this? - There is a hammer too.

826
00:34:54.567 --> 00:34:56.337
(Ax and hammer are necessary for building a house.)

827
00:34:56.337 --> 00:34:57.407
- An ax. - A knife.

828
00:34:57.407 --> 00:34:58.478
An ax and a knife.

829
00:34:58.478 --> 00:34:59.907
- Isn't this a fruit knife? - It is.

830
00:34:59.907 --> 00:35:01.877
I brought it for fish.

831
00:35:01.877 --> 00:35:02.918
Really?

832
00:35:03.177 --> 00:35:04.518
(She packed thoroughly.)

833
00:35:04.817 --> 00:35:06.547
Shall we set up a fish trap here?

834
00:35:06.547 --> 00:35:07.688
(There are tools for hunting...)

835
00:35:07.688 --> 00:35:08.757
Ta-da.

836
00:35:08.757 --> 00:35:09.817
(as well as a pouch for fruits.)

837
00:35:09.817 --> 00:35:11.188
You have all kinds of things.

838
00:35:11.958 --> 00:35:13.288
I am glad you brought them.

839
00:35:13.288 --> 00:35:14.587
(Even the veteran acknowledges...)

840
00:35:14.587 --> 00:35:17.257
(Chae Kyung as the queen of preparations.)

841
00:35:18.398 --> 00:35:19.797
- All right. - See you soon.

842
00:35:19.898 --> 00:35:21.427
- We will be back. - Okay.

843
00:35:21.768 --> 00:35:24.168
We don't have much time. Hurry up.

844
00:35:24.538 --> 00:35:25.567
Do something while you wait, okay?

845
00:35:26.308 --> 00:35:27.438
Do something while you wait, okay?

846
00:35:28.168 --> 00:35:30.578
- We will be back. - I will do that.

847
00:35:30.578 --> 00:35:31.578
(Don't worry about it.)

848
00:35:31.877 --> 00:35:32.907
We should take a rest.

849
00:35:32.907 --> 00:35:34.107
(Shall we take a rest?)

850
00:35:34.107 --> 00:35:37.777
I am tired after playing around.

851
00:35:38.947 --> 00:35:41.987
Shall we go over there and see if there are bananas?

852
00:35:41.987 --> 00:35:43.487
- Over there. - There are bananas.

853
00:35:43.487 --> 00:35:44.487
Where?

854
00:35:44.487 --> 00:35:47.027
Bananas. I see green bananas.

855
00:35:47.657 --> 00:35:49.058
They are on the tree.

856
00:35:49.058 --> 00:35:50.098
- Really? - Yes.

857
00:35:50.098 --> 00:35:51.757
Where?

858
00:35:51.757 --> 00:35:54.228
Over there. It's hard to spot them because they are green.

859
00:35:54.328 --> 00:35:56.098
- Are those bananas? I see them. - Yes.

860
00:35:56.098 --> 00:35:57.567
- There are bananas. - You are right.

861
00:35:57.567 --> 00:35:58.668
Let's go and get them.

862
00:36:00.107 --> 00:36:02.737
- Gosh, it's cold. - It's cold.

863
00:36:02.737 --> 00:36:05.277
(They go to get the bananas.)

864
00:36:06.507 --> 00:36:09.078
- Where did we see them? - They are over there.

865
00:36:09.078 --> 00:36:10.717
(Chae Kyung spots them right away.)

866
00:36:10.717 --> 00:36:11.777
They are over there.

867
00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:14.018
My goodness, there are bananas.

868
00:36:14.717 --> 00:36:16.918
They are baby bananas. Are those bananas for monkeys?

869
00:36:16.918 --> 00:36:17.987
(There is a hand of bananas not too high up from the ground.)

870
00:36:17.987 --> 00:36:19.558
- They look tasty. - How will we get them?

871
00:36:20.157 --> 00:36:22.157
(How will we get them?)

872
00:36:24.558 --> 00:36:25.728
Bananas.

873
00:36:25.728 --> 00:36:26.797
(They approach the bananas first.)

874
00:36:26.797 --> 00:36:27.868
(He grabs the bottom of the hand of bananas.)

875
00:36:27.868 --> 00:36:28.898
Be careful.

876
00:36:32.337 --> 00:36:34.967
(He shows Herculean strength with one hand.)

877
00:36:35.578 --> 00:36:37.078
(My goodness.)

878
00:36:37.907 --> 00:36:40.478
(Relaxed and comfortable)

879
00:36:41.777 --> 00:36:43.648
(She is impressed.)

880
00:36:44.248 --> 00:36:45.788
It's heavy.

881
00:36:46.388 --> 00:36:49.018
(The hand of bananas drops as soon as she receives it.)

882
00:36:49.757 --> 00:36:50.757
It's heavy.

883
00:36:50.757 --> 00:36:51.987
(He is so strong.)

884
00:36:52.688 --> 00:36:54.888
- Okay. - Banana, banana.

885
00:36:54.888 --> 00:36:57.328
These bananas...

886
00:36:57.697 --> 00:36:59.697
- aren't ripe. - Aren't they ripe?

887
00:36:59.697 --> 00:37:01.328
- No, they aren't. - Then how do we eat them?

888
00:37:01.328 --> 00:37:02.337
To eat them,

889
00:37:03.138 --> 00:37:06.407
we need to build a fire.

890
00:37:06.837 --> 00:37:09.007
It will take a long time to build a fire.

891
00:37:09.638 --> 00:37:11.808
We should do that first.

892
00:37:12.078 --> 00:37:13.748
Soon,

893
00:37:13.748 --> 00:37:16.018
- the sun will set. - The sun will set.

894
00:37:16.018 --> 00:37:19.047
With two men,

895
00:37:19.047 --> 00:37:20.817
cutting down bamboo...

896
00:37:21.288 --> 00:37:23.357
can be scary. I mean, it can be dangerous.

897
00:37:24.087 --> 00:37:25.857
- I will go and check up on them. - Okay.

898
00:37:25.857 --> 00:37:27.427
- I will be back. - Okay.

899
00:37:28.257 --> 00:37:29.998
Okay. Give me a moment.

900
00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:31.297
(He became a simple man.)

901
00:37:31.297 --> 00:37:33.527
- I will be back. - See you soon.

902
00:37:34.368 --> 00:37:36.268
I have never seen bamboos so tall.

903
00:37:36.268 --> 00:37:37.498
They are really tall.

904
00:37:37.498 --> 00:37:38.538
(They are looking for bamboos.)

905
00:37:39.438 --> 00:37:40.638
They are too tall.

906
00:37:42.107 --> 00:37:45.107
(They don't know what to do since the bamboos are so tall.)

907
00:37:45.107 --> 00:37:46.177
All right.

908
00:37:46.277 --> 00:37:49.717
I was determined to fill the gap Chief Byung Man left.

909
00:37:49.717 --> 00:37:50.777
(The veteran's dignity shines in an emergency situation.)

910
00:37:50.777 --> 00:37:53.118
(I will show you what I can do.)

911
00:37:54.348 --> 00:37:57.717
(He pulls down the bamboo.)

912
00:37:57.717 --> 00:38:00.388
- Shall we remove the branches? - Yes.

913
00:38:00.757 --> 00:38:03.828
Push gently and pull powerfully.

914
00:38:04.657 --> 00:38:06.197
(Staring)

915
00:38:07.268 --> 00:38:11.737
(He clenches his teeth and puts his muscles into the task.)

916
00:38:11.737 --> 00:38:12.737
(However, he still can't cut it.)

917
00:38:12.737 --> 00:38:13.808
I am exhausted.

918
00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:17.578
(They meet eyes awkwardly.)

919
00:38:17.578 --> 00:38:18.578
Shall I try it?

920
00:38:21.078 --> 00:38:23.447
(Jae Hyun steps forward enthusiastically.)

921
00:38:23.447 --> 00:38:25.348
(Cutting)

922
00:38:26.388 --> 00:38:27.518
(He removes a branch in 3 seconds.)

923
00:38:27.518 --> 00:38:29.257
You are good.

924
00:38:29.357 --> 00:38:31.157
(You are very good.)

925
00:38:33.757 --> 00:38:35.598
(He saws calmly...)

926
00:38:35.598 --> 00:38:36.657
I will bring more bamboos.

927
00:38:36.657 --> 00:38:39.067
(and axes cleanly.)

928
00:38:39.398 --> 00:38:40.467
All right.

929
00:38:40.467 --> 00:38:43.067
(The veteran struggles while the newbie sails through.)

930
00:38:44.098 --> 00:38:46.638
(Panting)

931
00:38:46.638 --> 00:38:47.808
You are exhausted, too, right?

932
00:38:48.567 --> 00:38:50.407
- You must be exhausted. - No, I am okay.

933
00:38:50.407 --> 00:38:51.407
Really?

934
00:38:52.107 --> 00:38:54.478
(I am the only one who is exhausted.)

935
00:38:55.677 --> 00:38:58.547
- Have you used a saw or an ax? - No, I haven't.

936
00:38:58.547 --> 00:39:00.087
- Is this your first time? - Yes, it is.

937
00:39:00.087 --> 00:39:01.188
(He is a prodigy.)

938
00:39:01.188 --> 00:39:02.317
You are good at it.

939
00:39:02.958 --> 00:39:05.458
(He is a prodigy of cutting down the branches.)

940
00:39:05.458 --> 00:39:06.987
Jae Hyun, you are good at it.

941
00:39:07.188 --> 00:39:11.098
It took more than 10 minutes to come here.

942
00:39:11.427 --> 00:39:13.427
How will you carry these bamboos back?

943
00:39:13.998 --> 00:39:16.837
I came because the task would be hard for two people.

944
00:39:16.837 --> 00:39:17.868
(In front of younger men, he is a charismatic man.)

945
00:39:19.237 --> 00:39:21.107
(He begins to work as soon as he arrives.)

946
00:39:21.337 --> 00:39:22.407
All right.

947
00:39:23.737 --> 00:39:27.877
(Herculean strength)

948
00:39:28.607 --> 00:39:29.918
You are the man.

949
00:39:30.447 --> 00:39:32.217
You are so strong.

950
00:39:33.087 --> 00:39:34.888
You are the strongest man I know.

951
00:39:36.587 --> 00:39:37.618
Get out of the way.

952
00:39:38.157 --> 00:39:39.587
(Throwing)

953
00:39:40.857 --> 00:39:43.228
(He throws a thick bamboo as if it's a chopstick.)

954
00:39:44.498 --> 00:39:47.627
(He is wrestling a big bamboo.)

955
00:39:49.138 --> 00:39:50.237
Get out of the way.

956
00:39:50.237 --> 00:39:51.268
(It's as big as an utility pole.)

957
00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:52.737
You are on a different class.

958
00:39:54.607 --> 00:39:59.248
(This is the class of Sung Hoon.)

959
00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:01.407
That's a small tree.

960
00:40:01.407 --> 00:40:03.618
(He carries it with one hand...)

961
00:40:03.618 --> 00:40:06.018
(and throws it on the ground in a cool way.)

962
00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.688
(The super powerful man of The Law of Jungle)

963
00:40:12.788 --> 00:40:15.927
(He removes the branches in one shot.)

964
00:40:17.157 --> 00:40:21.598
(Thanks to Sung Hoon's help, they finish getting bamboos.)

965
00:40:21.598 --> 00:40:23.168
I think we have enough.

966
00:40:23.168 --> 00:40:25.708
Would you be able to carry them?

967
00:40:25.808 --> 00:40:28.938
Let's share the burden. 1 for Jae Hyun and 1 for me,

968
00:40:29.938 --> 00:40:31.038
and the rest for you.

969
00:40:31.138 --> 00:40:32.177
(Flustered)

970
00:40:32.177 --> 00:40:34.748
It won't look good if I carry all of them back.

971
00:40:34.748 --> 00:40:35.748
(It will look good if you carry most of them.)

972
00:40:35.748 --> 00:40:36.817
- Don't you agree? - I do.

973
00:40:37.148 --> 00:40:39.748
Try carrying them. Let's see how hard the task is.

974
00:40:39.918 --> 00:40:42.587
Try carrying as many bamboos as you can.

975
00:40:42.788 --> 00:40:45.217
One. Here. Catch it.

976
00:40:45.587 --> 00:40:46.927
- Wait a minute. - Here you go.

977
00:40:46.927 --> 00:40:47.958
- Here you go. - Wait a minute.

978
00:40:47.958 --> 00:40:48.998
My goodness.

979
00:40:48.998 --> 00:40:50.058
(He tosses another one.)

980
00:40:50.328 --> 00:40:51.958
- Here is the third one. - Don't throw it.

981
00:40:51.958 --> 00:40:54.067
My goodness.

982
00:40:54.067 --> 00:40:55.368
You are so mischievous.

983
00:40:55.768 --> 00:40:57.268
(This is a bonus.)

984
00:40:57.268 --> 00:40:59.368
I can hold them.

985
00:40:59.368 --> 00:41:00.607
- Go. - However, I can barely walk.

986
00:41:00.868 --> 00:41:03.708
- Go sideways. - I will have to go like this.

987
00:41:03.708 --> 00:41:05.237
There you go.

988
00:41:06.447 --> 00:41:07.708
- Okay. - That's good.

989
00:41:08.377 --> 00:41:09.518
There you go.

990
00:41:09.518 --> 00:41:10.518
(These bamboos are heavy.)

991
00:41:10.518 --> 00:41:12.087
(He should have watched his words.)

992
00:41:12.087 --> 00:41:13.748
That's all, right? Let's go.

993
00:41:13.748 --> 00:41:15.987
(Even the bamboos can be heavy to carry alone.)

994
00:41:18.018 --> 00:41:20.487
(Chae Kyung is alone.)

995
00:41:20.487 --> 00:41:21.857
I can beat it with this.

996
00:41:23.228 --> 00:41:24.627
I will do laundry at Fiji.

997
00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:29.368
(Chae Kyung prepares to wash clothes by the running water.)

998
00:41:29.368 --> 00:41:32.237
(She gets the members' dirty clothes.)

999
00:41:32.237 --> 00:41:35.138
Wait a minute. I need to go where the current is weak.

1000
00:41:36.478 --> 00:41:39.277
(She begins to do the laundry without a detergent.)

1001
00:41:39.277 --> 00:41:40.447
Will it work?

1002
00:41:43.047 --> 00:41:45.047
I think it's working. The grime came off.

1003
00:41:46.348 --> 00:41:47.418
It's working.

1004
00:41:47.418 --> 00:41:48.618
(Beating)

1005
00:41:48.618 --> 00:41:50.888
(Working hard)

1006
00:41:52.427 --> 00:41:54.257
(Is that enough?)

1007
00:41:56.697 --> 00:41:59.768
It became clean, right? It was dirty before.

1008
00:42:02.297 --> 00:42:05.507
(She works like the mothers back in the days...)

1009
00:42:05.507 --> 00:42:07.868
This is how people did the laundry back in the days, right?

1010
00:42:07.868 --> 00:42:09.107
(who dipped their hands in cold water for their families.)

1011
00:42:09.107 --> 00:42:10.107
This is exhausting.

1012
00:42:10.107 --> 00:42:14.808
(Chae Kyung removes the evidence of survival.)

1013
00:42:17.078 --> 00:42:18.418
Since the weather is nice,

1014
00:42:18.418 --> 00:42:20.817
the clothes will dry soon.

1015
00:42:32.686 --> 00:42:34.286
It's hard to own a house.

1016
00:42:34.286 --> 00:42:36.155
(It's hard to own a house.)

1017
00:42:42.056 --> 00:42:43.795
(They return to the base.)

1018
00:42:43.795 --> 00:42:45.166
- My goodness. - Move out of the way.

1019
00:42:45.166 --> 00:42:46.195
- Be careful. - Be careful.

1020
00:42:46.195 --> 00:42:47.195
They are so heavy!

1021
00:42:47.396 --> 00:42:49.735
(Exhausted)

1022
00:42:50.766 --> 00:42:51.965
(Thank you for your hard work.)

1023
00:42:51.965 --> 00:42:55.105
- Those are the bananas. - I see.

1024
00:42:55.335 --> 00:42:57.846
- Have you tried it? - It's unripe.

1025
00:42:57.945 --> 00:42:58.976
Really?

1026
00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:00.675
(I am so hungry. I want to eat it.)

1027
00:43:00.675 --> 00:43:02.186
Isn't it still edible?

1028
00:43:03.085 --> 00:43:04.215
Wouldn't it taste bitter?

1029
00:43:04.215 --> 00:43:06.655
(The green banana definitely looks bitter.)

1030
00:43:06.655 --> 00:43:08.556
Chae Kyung, there hasn't been one thing...

1031
00:43:09.025 --> 00:43:10.985
- you found unsavory in the jungle. - No.

1032
00:43:12.126 --> 00:43:13.396
Do you want to try it?

1033
00:43:15.666 --> 00:43:17.496
(She puts it in her mouth without hesitation.)

1034
00:43:17.996 --> 00:43:19.036
It's unsavory.

1035
00:43:20.266 --> 00:43:22.096
Is it unsavory?

1036
00:43:22.536 --> 00:43:23.565
Yes.

1037
00:43:23.565 --> 00:43:27.806
(A bite makes him want to spit out.)

1038
00:43:28.605 --> 00:43:30.576
(It's really bitter.)

1039
00:43:31.376 --> 00:43:33.646
(Sung Hoon didn't see them eat the banana.)

1040
00:43:33.976 --> 00:43:35.215
Sung Hoon, do you want to try a banana?

1041
00:43:35.545 --> 00:43:37.116
- Try this. - That's not ripe.

1042
00:43:37.516 --> 00:43:38.916
- It's a bit sweet though. - Come.

1043
00:43:39.155 --> 00:43:40.956
(They exchange glances.)

1044
00:43:42.016 --> 00:43:44.025
Eat this and you'll be energized.

1045
00:43:44.025 --> 00:43:45.525
(Their mission is to deceive Sung Hoon.)

1046
00:43:45.525 --> 00:43:46.855
- Isn't it good? - It's really good.

1047
00:43:47.295 --> 00:43:48.556
It's really delicious.

1048
00:43:48.556 --> 00:43:49.596
(She acts sincere.)

1049
00:43:49.596 --> 00:43:50.666
It's sweet.

1050
00:43:51.096 --> 00:43:52.396
(Is it really delicious?)

1051
00:43:52.766 --> 00:43:54.396
- It's good. - It's a bit sweet.

1052
00:43:54.396 --> 00:43:56.536
- I know what it tastes like. - It's edible.

1053
00:43:56.536 --> 00:43:57.835
(Sung Hoon takes a bite.)

1054
00:43:57.835 --> 00:44:00.206
(Spitting)

1055
00:44:00.876 --> 00:44:01.876
It's not...

1056
00:44:01.876 --> 00:44:03.076
(Gagging)

1057
00:44:04.576 --> 00:44:05.616
(Laughing)

1058
00:44:05.616 --> 00:44:06.715
I knew it.

1059
00:44:07.715 --> 00:44:09.616
(If you knew it then why did you eat it?)

1060
00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:11.945
It's really bitter, isn't it?

1061
00:44:14.255 --> 00:44:15.726
We'll have to eat it cooked.

1062
00:44:15.726 --> 00:44:17.556
- We have to fry it. - Yes.

1063
00:44:17.956 --> 00:44:20.255
Now we have to build a shelter.

1064
00:44:20.255 --> 00:44:23.666
We'll stick four pillars and cover them with a roof.

1065
00:44:23.666 --> 00:44:25.025
- Do we have a rope? - Yes.

1066
00:44:25.025 --> 00:44:26.096
We do?

1067
00:44:26.096 --> 00:44:27.936
Let's go. The sun will set soon.

1068
00:44:27.936 --> 00:44:30.306
(Will they be able to build a shelter before the sunset?)

1069
00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:33.775
(Dindin and Roy are...)

1070
00:44:33.775 --> 00:44:34.905
This is it.

1071
00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:37.746
Honestly...

1072
00:44:37.746 --> 00:44:39.815
(Roy is trying to start a fire.)

1073
00:44:39.815 --> 00:44:42.516
(But...)

1074
00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:45.485
(his posture is...)

1075
00:44:45.485 --> 00:44:48.516
(like a taffy seller.)

1076
00:44:48.516 --> 00:44:49.956
Try the other side.

1077
00:44:50.885 --> 00:44:52.355
- This... - Bang it with that side.

1078
00:44:52.355 --> 00:44:53.726
(With the knife handle?)

1079
00:44:53.726 --> 00:44:57.096
(Don't they know how to use a fire steel?)

1080
00:44:58.025 --> 00:44:59.965
Sparks won't solve the problem.

1081
00:44:59.965 --> 00:45:00.965
(Dindin takes the fire steel.)

1082
00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:02.905
I think we should bring firewood and do this.

1083
00:45:02.905 --> 00:45:04.105
Let me try.

1084
00:45:04.465 --> 00:45:05.735
- Here I go. - Are you sure?

1085
00:45:05.735 --> 00:45:06.735
Here I go.

1086
00:45:09.445 --> 00:45:11.376
- I'll do it. - it's working.

1087
00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:12.746
(Arguing)

1088
00:45:12.746 --> 00:45:13.846
Wait a minute.

1089
00:45:14.346 --> 00:45:16.585
Wait. Don't throw it like that.

1090
00:45:16.746 --> 00:45:18.855
(It's Roy's turn again.)

1091
00:45:20.016 --> 00:45:21.456
(Lacking strength)

1092
00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:22.925
(Will it catch fire?)

1093
00:45:22.925 --> 00:45:24.425
Let's take a moment here.

1094
00:45:25.425 --> 00:45:27.396
Shall we look at...

1095
00:45:27.396 --> 00:45:30.425
how Jong Hyuk started a fire last night?

1096
00:45:31.266 --> 00:45:33.166
You have to scrape...

1097
00:45:33.166 --> 00:45:36.206
the spine of the knife down the length of the rod.

1098
00:45:37.266 --> 00:45:40.206
Hitting on it or making short strokes will not...

1099
00:45:40.206 --> 00:45:41.936
work at all.

1100
00:45:42.775 --> 00:45:46.616
(They don't know how to use the tool.)

1101
00:45:46.616 --> 00:45:49.315
Isn't this weird? Some parts work and some don't.

1102
00:45:49.516 --> 00:45:50.646
Is it cheaply made?

1103
00:45:50.646 --> 00:45:51.916
(There's nothing wrong with it.)

1104
00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:53.556
Usually...

1105
00:45:53.556 --> 00:45:54.616
(The cameraman tells them how to use it.)

1106
00:45:54.616 --> 00:45:56.226
- you flip it. - Flip this?

1107
00:45:56.226 --> 00:45:58.126
- No. - The blade.

1108
00:45:58.896 --> 00:46:00.096
Like you're sharpening a pencil...

1109
00:46:00.456 --> 00:46:02.626
You've sharpened a pencil before, right?

1110
00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:03.666
(How do you sharpen a pencil?)

1111
00:46:03.666 --> 00:46:04.866
Like this?

1112
00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:06.965
(My goodness.)

1113
00:46:06.965 --> 00:46:11.905
(The cameraman shows them a special demonstration.)

1114
00:46:12.505 --> 00:46:13.576
- Sir! - I mean...

1115
00:46:13.576 --> 00:46:15.876
you have to do it like you're sharpening a pencil.

1116
00:46:16.146 --> 00:46:17.206
(What is he trying to do?)

1117
00:46:17.206 --> 00:46:19.576
You shouldn't stroke it fast like you did.

1118
00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:22.116
- You can't do it that way. - Hey, if what he taught us...

1119
00:46:22.116 --> 00:46:24.916
doesn't get edited out, you'll be the bad guy.

1120
00:46:26.085 --> 00:46:27.456
(Gesturing)

1121
00:46:27.456 --> 00:46:29.885
- People will think this is how... - Wait a minute.

1122
00:46:30.155 --> 00:46:31.525
(This is the editing point.)

1123
00:46:31.525 --> 00:46:32.655
(We'll start over from here.)

1124
00:46:32.655 --> 00:46:33.925
- Hey, this... - This is...

1125
00:46:33.925 --> 00:46:35.096
Give it to me.

1126
00:46:35.195 --> 00:46:36.266
- This... - I know.

1127
00:46:36.266 --> 00:46:38.025
- I learned it too. - Like you'd sharpen a pencil,

1128
00:46:38.025 --> 00:46:40.295
- you push down like this. - I learned it.

1129
00:46:40.295 --> 00:46:41.996
Let's gather this a bit.

1130
00:46:42.335 --> 00:46:43.866
Yes, push the blade like you're sharpening a pencil.

1131
00:46:45.476 --> 00:46:47.605
(We learned how to use it, so let's do it right.)

1132
00:46:47.605 --> 00:46:49.206
(But there is only one fire steel.)

1133
00:46:49.706 --> 00:46:51.175
Let me try.

1134
00:46:51.545 --> 00:46:54.175
- Just this once. - Block the wind.

1135
00:46:54.175 --> 00:46:55.485
Aren't I the chief?

1136
00:46:56.746 --> 00:46:59.556
Let me try three times. Just three times.

1137
00:46:59.556 --> 00:47:01.385
I got it. It'll work this time.

1138
00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.025
It'll work now.

1139
00:47:03.226 --> 00:47:05.385
One. It's working.

1140
00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:07.126
(Dindin wants to try more.)

1141
00:47:07.126 --> 00:47:08.425
(Roy is counting the strikes.)

1142
00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:09.425
Go make a shelter.

1143
00:47:09.896 --> 00:47:12.335
(It's my turn!)

1144
00:47:12.335 --> 00:47:13.436
Get out of my way.

1145
00:47:13.436 --> 00:47:14.596
(They act like kindergartners.)

1146
00:47:14.596 --> 00:47:15.905
I'm the chief.

1147
00:47:20.536 --> 00:47:21.806
(Fanning)

1148
00:47:21.806 --> 00:47:25.306
(Dindin bothers Roy like a 4-year-old.)

1149
00:47:25.306 --> 00:47:26.876
Let me try just once, Roy.

1150
00:47:26.876 --> 00:47:28.916
(Dindin whines and Roy sulks.)

1151
00:47:29.445 --> 00:47:31.516
- You called me stupid. - Let's do this quickly.

1152
00:47:31.516 --> 00:47:32.556
(Kids, be nice to each other.)

1153
00:47:32.556 --> 00:47:33.616
Here I go.

1154
00:47:33.616 --> 00:47:34.855
(They keep trying.)

1155
00:47:34.855 --> 00:47:35.885
(A spark!)

1156
00:47:35.885 --> 00:47:38.355
(Finally, they sparked a fire!)

1157
00:47:39.096 --> 00:47:40.155
There!

1158
00:47:41.056 --> 00:47:43.226
- Don't blow on it. - We shouldn't blow on it?

1159
00:47:43.726 --> 00:47:46.135
- You have to leave it. - I know that.

1160
00:47:46.135 --> 00:47:47.135
(Sulky)

1161
00:47:47.235 --> 00:47:49.905
- He nags too much. - Good luck!

1162
00:47:49.905 --> 00:47:51.366
You're doing well.

1163
00:47:51.366 --> 00:47:52.436
(You can do it!)

1164
00:47:53.476 --> 00:47:54.905
Go do something else.

1165
00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:57.275
Why do you have to be here?

1166
00:47:57.275 --> 00:48:01.545
Because the one who makes a fire looks like the main character.

1167
00:48:02.985 --> 00:48:06.155
(Gosh, I was just thinking that.)

1168
00:48:06.556 --> 00:48:08.715
(These two kindergartners...)

1169
00:48:08.715 --> 00:48:11.525
(spent over an hour trying to make a fire.)

1170
00:48:11.525 --> 00:48:14.096
(They tried a few hundred times.)

1171
00:48:15.866 --> 00:48:17.795
(I'll be the one to start the fire.)

1172
00:48:17.996 --> 00:48:20.536
The sun is almost down, but we didn't even build a shelter.

1173
00:48:20.996 --> 00:48:22.706
Should I go get some food first?

1174
00:48:23.806 --> 00:48:25.235
- That's a good idea. - Okay.

1175
00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:26.876
I'll go get food then.

1176
00:48:26.876 --> 00:48:29.246
I gave you the chance to make a fire.

1177
00:48:29.246 --> 00:48:31.505
- I gave you the chance. - No, I gave you the chance.

1178
00:48:31.505 --> 00:48:32.675
Start a fire no matter what.

1179
00:48:32.675 --> 00:48:36.885
(Will Roy be able to build a fire on his own?)

1180
00:48:37.516 --> 00:48:39.885
The height will be... I think we need a saw.

1181
00:48:39.885 --> 00:48:41.485
- This much will be enough. - Yes.

1182
00:48:41.755 --> 00:48:43.025
- This? - Yes.

1183
00:48:43.025 --> 00:48:45.556
- We don't need this then? - This? No.

1184
00:48:45.795 --> 00:48:47.996
- We'll go with this length. - I know.

1185
00:48:47.996 --> 00:48:50.166
If you want that length, this won't be enough.

1186
00:48:50.166 --> 00:48:51.465
About this height...

1187
00:48:51.465 --> 00:48:52.766
- Yes, it's better that way. - Okay.

1188
00:48:52.766 --> 00:48:54.366
- We have to use it sparingly. - Okay.

1189
00:48:54.366 --> 00:48:55.465
(How will they build a shelter on a rock?)

1190
00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:56.905
- Okay. We'll use this. - Yes.

1191
00:48:57.766 --> 00:49:00.976
We'll set four posts upright...

1192
00:49:00.976 --> 00:49:05.005
and we'll tie four poles on top of them.

1193
00:49:05.005 --> 00:49:08.715
Then we'll put banana leaves on top as a roof.

1194
00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:10.516
It'll get dark soon.

1195
00:49:10.516 --> 00:49:11.545
(They're aiming to finish before it gets dark.)

1196
00:49:11.545 --> 00:49:12.686
We need to hurry.

1197
00:49:13.355 --> 00:49:17.686
They're building a shelter without Byung Man for the first time.

1198
00:49:17.686 --> 00:49:20.795
With their skills, they have no problem building it.

1199
00:49:21.195 --> 00:49:24.425
I wonder how the shelter will look like.

1200
00:49:24.425 --> 00:49:25.465
That's right.

1201
00:49:26.936 --> 00:49:29.266
- Let's get leaves. - Yes.

1202
00:49:29.635 --> 00:49:32.065
- The most... - Pretty ones.

1203
00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:33.335
We'll get pretty ones.

1204
00:49:33.505 --> 00:49:35.945
- Should we get this? - This one looks good.

1205
00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:37.545
The leaf is huge.

1206
00:49:38.005 --> 00:49:39.775
It's huge and there's no fruit.

1207
00:49:40.846 --> 00:49:42.686
I've never cut one before.

1208
00:49:44.545 --> 00:49:45.556
(He gets ready to strike.)

1209
00:49:45.556 --> 00:49:47.085
- Will this work? - Go for it.

1210
00:49:47.416 --> 00:49:48.485
(Hitting)

1211
00:49:50.355 --> 00:49:51.525
It's huge.

1212
00:49:51.525 --> 00:49:54.255
(One shot, one kill.)

1213
00:49:55.155 --> 00:49:56.465
You got it at one shot.

1214
00:49:56.965 --> 00:49:58.126
(Amazed)

1215
00:49:58.525 --> 00:50:02.036
I actually surprised myself after striking it.

1216
00:50:02.036 --> 00:50:03.105
(But he doesn't sound surprised.)

1217
00:50:03.105 --> 00:50:04.235
(He's emotionless like a terminator.)

1218
00:50:04.235 --> 00:50:05.505
It's really huge.

1219
00:50:07.735 --> 00:50:08.775
(Super size leaf)

1220
00:50:08.775 --> 00:50:10.076
- Awesome. - This is...

1221
00:50:10.076 --> 00:50:11.976
Each of us can have one.

1222
00:50:12.616 --> 00:50:13.646
- You're the man. - I'll get this.

1223
00:50:13.646 --> 00:50:14.675
(He cuts it clean so it can grow again.)

1224
00:50:14.675 --> 00:50:15.715
Great.

1225
00:50:16.116 --> 00:50:18.616
(He shows off his slicing skills.)

1226
00:50:21.815 --> 00:50:23.525
(He cuts everything with one strike.)

1227
00:50:23.525 --> 00:50:24.786
- Nice. - Good.

1228
00:50:24.786 --> 00:50:26.025
Nice.

1229
00:50:28.295 --> 00:50:29.465
Jae Hyun.

1230
00:50:29.465 --> 00:50:31.166
(Jae Hyun cuts and Chae Kyung stacks.)

1231
00:50:31.166 --> 00:50:33.866
(Perfect teamwork)

1232
00:50:37.565 --> 00:50:38.735
Will this be enough?

1233
00:50:40.675 --> 00:50:43.376
I think this is enough.

1234
00:50:45.445 --> 00:50:46.476
Let's go.

1235
00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:47.746
(They got enough banana leaves.)

1236
00:50:48.885 --> 00:50:50.846
Woo Jin and Sung Hoon will be happy.

1237
00:50:50.846 --> 00:50:52.286
(They're proud of themselves.)

1238
00:50:58.655 --> 00:50:59.826
What's this?

1239
00:50:59.826 --> 00:51:00.896
(Jae Hyun spots something.)

1240
00:51:01.155 --> 00:51:02.166
This?

1241
00:51:02.166 --> 00:51:04.226
(What's this?)

1242
00:51:05.065 --> 00:51:07.436
There's something green at the end.

1243
00:51:07.436 --> 00:51:09.036
(There are small green fruits.)

1244
00:51:09.235 --> 00:51:11.266
Is it hot pepper? It looks like jalapeno.

1245
00:51:11.266 --> 00:51:12.405
Can I try it?

1246
00:51:14.306 --> 00:51:15.376
(She tastes a little bit.)

1247
00:51:15.675 --> 00:51:17.646
- How is it? - Hot pepper. It's spicy!

1248
00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:19.576
(She reacts right away.)

1249
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:20.715
Is it really spicy?

1250
00:51:20.715 --> 00:51:22.385
(The spicy capsaicin attacks!)

1251
00:51:23.746 --> 00:51:25.755
(Curious Jae Hyun takes a bite.)

1252
00:51:26.355 --> 00:51:27.416
Isn't it spicy?

1253
00:51:28.686 --> 00:51:31.556
(He doesn't react like Chae Kyung.)

1254
00:51:32.496 --> 00:51:34.496
- Is it spicy or not? - It's spicy.

1255
00:51:34.755 --> 00:51:36.096
It's really spicy.

1256
00:51:36.096 --> 00:51:37.396
(But your reaction is...)

1257
00:51:37.396 --> 00:51:39.295
It's hot pepper.

1258
00:51:39.295 --> 00:51:40.396
(Chae Kyung is still suffering.)

1259
00:51:41.666 --> 00:51:43.465
(Jae Hyun doesn't react much.)

1260
00:51:43.465 --> 00:51:45.005
- Let's pick some. - Shall we?

1261
00:51:45.605 --> 00:51:47.576
Here are some more. There are red ones.

1262
00:51:47.576 --> 00:51:48.635
Are the red ones spicy too?

1263
00:51:49.545 --> 00:51:51.746
(He tries the red one.)

1264
00:51:51.746 --> 00:51:53.616
(Chae Kyung can still taste the hot pepper.)

1265
00:51:54.715 --> 00:51:57.085
- Is it spicy? - This is the spiciest.

1266
00:51:57.085 --> 00:51:58.246
(This is the spiciest.)

1267
00:51:59.016 --> 00:52:01.485
- It must be hot pepper. - This is really spicy.

1268
00:52:02.525 --> 00:52:04.155
(Coughing)

1269
00:52:05.726 --> 00:52:08.596
(The strong spicy flavor gets to you slowly.)

1270
00:52:11.626 --> 00:52:13.036
(It's super spicy.)

1271
00:52:13.036 --> 00:52:14.436
I'm crying.

1272
00:52:14.835 --> 00:52:15.905
I'm really crying.

1273
00:52:15.905 --> 00:52:17.735
(Teary)

1274
00:52:20.505 --> 00:52:22.646
It'll be really spicy if you take the whole thing.

1275
00:52:22.775 --> 00:52:24.976
- Let's pick the red ones. - Red ones are really hot.

1276
00:52:24.976 --> 00:52:27.076
Let's tell them they're not spicy.

1277
00:52:27.076 --> 00:52:28.076
Okay.

1278
00:52:28.846 --> 00:52:30.315
- We have to pretend. - Okay.

1279
00:52:30.315 --> 00:52:31.346
(Pretend it's not spicy.)

1280
00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:34.315
Tell them it's crunchy like green pepper.

1281
00:52:34.315 --> 00:52:36.186
Okay. It tastes sweet.

1282
00:52:37.085 --> 00:52:39.126
- Let's practice. - This hot pepper tastes sweet.

1283
00:52:39.126 --> 00:52:41.496
- What does it taste like? - It's sweet. You should try.

1284
00:52:41.896 --> 00:52:43.166
It tastes sweet.

1285
00:52:44.166 --> 00:52:46.536
(Sung Hoon and Woo Jin are busy building a shelter.)

1286
00:52:46.596 --> 00:52:48.496
- Yes. - Guys, this is awesome.

1287
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:49.666
- What is it? - It's amazing.

1288
00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:51.666
We picked some fruit.

1289
00:52:51.666 --> 00:52:53.405
- Fruit? - Do you know what it is?

1290
00:52:53.405 --> 00:52:55.275
- What is it? - Hot peppers.

1291
00:52:55.646 --> 00:52:56.846
Hot pepper is a fruit?

1292
00:52:56.846 --> 00:52:58.505
No. I have hot peppers.

1293
00:52:58.706 --> 00:53:01.746
- It's like green pepper. - It's kind of like green pepper.

1294
00:53:01.746 --> 00:53:02.815
It's similar.

1295
00:53:02.916 --> 00:53:04.186
- It's so good. - Really?

1296
00:53:04.186 --> 00:53:05.516
- Yes. - It's delicious?

1297
00:53:05.516 --> 00:53:07.456
- It's delicious. - Hot peppers are spicy.

1298
00:53:07.456 --> 00:53:08.616
- This isn't. - It's not spicy at all.

1299
00:53:08.616 --> 00:53:11.485
It's totally like green pepper. Look.

1300
00:53:11.485 --> 00:53:12.826
(They aren't sure.)

1301
00:53:13.855 --> 00:53:15.565
(Chae Kyung takes a bite.)

1302
00:53:16.065 --> 00:53:17.195
Isn't that a spicy one?

1303
00:53:17.195 --> 00:53:19.666
- Usually in Korea... - The small ones are spicy.

1304
00:53:19.666 --> 00:53:21.195
Yes, the small ones are spicy.

1305
00:53:22.135 --> 00:53:23.166
- No. - The small ones are spicy.

1306
00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:24.166
(It looks like I'll finish this.)

1307
00:53:25.806 --> 00:53:27.436
- Really. It's not spicy. - It's like green pepper.

1308
00:53:27.675 --> 00:53:29.105
For real. I can't eat spicy food.

1309
00:53:29.105 --> 00:53:30.105
There's a red one.

1310
00:53:30.105 --> 00:53:31.846
Do you want a red one or a green one?

1311
00:53:33.616 --> 00:53:34.675
- What about red one? - Red one?

1312
00:53:34.715 --> 00:53:36.385
Would you like the red chili pepper?

1313
00:53:36.815 --> 00:53:38.616
- Or the green one? - Goodness.

1314
00:53:39.556 --> 00:53:40.855
I'll go with the red one.

1315
00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:43.456
- Are you serious though? - Then...

1316
00:53:43.456 --> 00:53:44.485
It's really good.

1317
00:53:45.596 --> 00:53:46.925
(Everyone gets one.)

1318
00:53:46.925 --> 00:53:47.956
Here's the green one.

1319
00:53:48.056 --> 00:53:50.226
- Goodness, it looks... - Seriously. This looks...

1320
00:53:50.266 --> 00:53:52.025
It looks really spicy.

1321
00:53:52.735 --> 00:53:53.766
Smell it.

1322
00:53:53.835 --> 00:53:55.505
- It doesn't smell. - The smell...

1323
00:53:55.505 --> 00:53:56.565
(These con-artists are anxious.)

1324
00:53:56.565 --> 00:53:58.105
- It doesn't, right? - It smells really spicy.

1325
00:53:58.105 --> 00:53:59.235
- It's not spicy. - It's not spicy at all.

1326
00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:01.476
- Try it. - Don't you agree?

1327
00:54:01.476 --> 00:54:03.706
(Woo Jin puts the chili pepper in his mouth.)

1328
00:54:04.346 --> 00:54:05.376
Try it.

1329
00:54:05.376 --> 00:54:06.376
(Popping in)

1330
00:54:07.945 --> 00:54:10.246
(The spiciness...)

1331
00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:12.456
(kicks in.)

1332
00:54:14.255 --> 00:54:16.726
He really ate it. I told you I wouldn't eat it.

1333
00:54:17.585 --> 00:54:18.585
Are you serious?

1334
00:54:19.025 --> 00:54:21.956
- I'm just joking. - What?

1335
00:54:22.056 --> 00:54:23.766
I was just kidding, but it really is sweet.

1336
00:54:23.766 --> 00:54:24.766
- Isn't it tasty? - It's sweet, isn't it?

1337
00:54:24.766 --> 00:54:26.666
- How could this exist? - Isn't it sweet? I'm serious.

1338
00:54:26.666 --> 00:54:27.965
Where did you find them? You should get more.

1339
00:54:28.195 --> 00:54:29.866
- Are you serious? - But how can it be sweet though?

1340
00:54:30.036 --> 00:54:31.706
It's sweet, isn't it? It's like the cucumber chili pepper.

1341
00:54:31.706 --> 00:54:32.735
This is so interesting.

1342
00:54:32.806 --> 00:54:34.076
(Sung Hoon gives it some thought.)

1343
00:54:34.076 --> 00:54:36.405
It has that sweet and sour taste.

1344
00:54:36.646 --> 00:54:38.815
(Oh, my goodness)

1345
00:54:38.815 --> 00:54:41.445
(The spiciest taste attacks his palate.)

1346
00:54:41.445 --> 00:54:44.246
(Everyone is having a feast with the spicy chili peppers.)

1347
00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:48.056
(My mouth is on fire as well as my stomach.)

1348
00:54:48.956 --> 00:54:51.255
(He's unleashing what he's been holding back earlier.)

1349
00:54:51.255 --> 00:54:52.456
Gosh, this is so spicy!

1350
00:54:54.155 --> 00:54:55.565
(Unable to stay calm)

1351
00:54:55.565 --> 00:54:56.965
I endured it just to make him eat.

1352
00:54:56.965 --> 00:54:58.465
(Gulping down)

1353
00:55:01.866 --> 00:55:02.965
This is so spicy.

1354
00:55:02.965 --> 00:55:04.166
(The younger members are coming clean at last.)

1355
00:55:04.166 --> 00:55:06.476
My stomach hurts. It really does.

1356
00:55:07.175 --> 00:55:09.476
You know how your stomach hurts if you eat this on an empty stomach?

1357
00:55:11.445 --> 00:55:13.445
Goodness, that was good.

1358
00:55:13.445 --> 00:55:14.445
(They successfully deceive the Captain.)

1359
00:55:15.746 --> 00:55:17.545
(He's out of it.)

1360
00:55:18.646 --> 00:55:20.786
- This is no joke. - Why did you put up with it?

1361
00:55:21.485 --> 00:55:22.956
I wanted to trick you.

1362
00:55:22.956 --> 00:55:24.755
Goodness, you're incredible.

1363
00:55:24.855 --> 00:55:26.295
I was so shocked.

1364
00:55:26.655 --> 00:55:27.956
(I wanted you to join me. Sorry.)

1365
00:55:27.956 --> 00:55:29.326
My stomach really hurts.

1366
00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:33.866
Hey, we should give this to Roy.

1367
00:55:35.135 --> 00:55:37.905
(Give me the spicy chili pepper!)

1368
00:55:38.936 --> 00:55:41.576
We have to take the bananas too.

1369
00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:44.405
Give it to him with the bananas. Tell him they're both sweet.

1370
00:55:44.806 --> 00:55:46.846
- I should give them to him. - They are delicacies.

1371
00:55:47.215 --> 00:55:48.215
Unbelievable.

1372
00:55:48.215 --> 00:55:49.286
(Is Jong Hyuk doing okay though?)

1373
00:55:51.085 --> 00:55:53.815
(On the other hand, Jong Hyuk is carrying out the hidden mission.)

1374
00:55:54.956 --> 00:55:57.925
(A school of sharks appears.)

1375
00:55:59.655 --> 00:56:01.855
I couldn't count them. There weren't just a few of them.

1376
00:56:02.326 --> 00:56:04.266
(It's packed with sharks.)

1377
00:56:07.666 --> 00:56:10.436
I was looking at them from afar, but all of a sudden...

1378
00:56:13.005 --> 00:56:14.806
(Looking around)

1379
00:56:14.806 --> 00:56:19.076
(The expert is looking for someone before feeding them.)

1380
00:56:23.385 --> 00:56:26.485
(Hey, what are you doing over there? Come here.)

1381
00:56:26.485 --> 00:56:28.715
(Is he calling Jong Hyuk?)

1382
00:56:28.715 --> 00:56:30.556
I had my thumbs up without realizing it.

1383
00:56:30.826 --> 00:56:34.456
That was involuntary although that's not how I was feeling.

1384
00:56:34.855 --> 00:56:36.226
I was going forward.

1385
00:56:37.326 --> 00:56:40.866
I moved forward and stood there with the guide.

1386
00:56:40.866 --> 00:56:42.965
We both knelt down.

1387
00:56:42.965 --> 00:56:44.936
(He positioned himself on the way where the sharks pass by.)

1388
00:56:44.936 --> 00:56:46.835
(We filmed it safely with experts and verified life guards.)

1389
00:56:46.835 --> 00:56:49.045
When I was observing the situation,

1390
00:56:50.105 --> 00:56:51.346
it literally passed by right before my eyes.

1391
00:56:51.346 --> 00:56:52.576
(The sharks pass by before his eyes.)

1392
00:56:52.576 --> 00:56:53.815
(Startled)

1393
00:56:56.646 --> 00:56:58.956
(After he moves his spot, he sees them...)

1394
00:56:58.956 --> 00:57:00.916
(closer, and they seem more real.)

1395
00:57:05.355 --> 00:57:06.355
They were so big.

1396
00:57:06.655 --> 00:57:09.496
The biggest one was as big as a van.

1397
00:57:09.496 --> 00:57:11.396
(They were so big. The biggest one was as big as a van.)

1398
00:57:11.396 --> 00:57:14.195
It was swarming with sharks as long as 3m or 4m.

1399
00:57:14.766 --> 00:57:18.505
My heart was pounding, and I couldn't breathe well.

1400
00:57:23.346 --> 00:57:26.916
(The expert takes out the food and starts feeding them.)

1401
00:57:26.916 --> 00:57:32.456
(They usually feed sharks tuna or big fish's heads.)

1402
00:57:36.556 --> 00:57:40.355
(A shark comes closer after smelling the fish.)

1403
00:57:43.096 --> 00:57:47.135
(Unfamiliar-looking sharks...)

1404
00:57:47.135 --> 00:57:50.065
(approach in a herd.)

1405
00:57:50.605 --> 00:57:54.635
I didn't know the kind of sharks, but their mouths were square-shaped.

1406
00:57:54.635 --> 00:57:56.076
(What are their identities?)

1407
00:57:56.076 --> 00:57:58.206
What was the name of it? Was it a hammerhead shark?

1408
00:57:58.746 --> 00:57:59.775
It wasn't that.

1409
00:58:01.146 --> 00:58:03.346
The shark was getting close, but it took a turn.

1410
00:58:04.416 --> 00:58:05.755
I thought it was playing with me.

1411
00:58:06.286 --> 00:58:08.485
I think the shark did that on purpose.

1412
00:58:10.556 --> 00:58:11.956
They were so nice.

1413
00:58:11.956 --> 00:58:19.496
(Tawny nurse sharks have a mild personality and play with divers.)

1414
00:58:19.565 --> 00:58:22.465
(The shark circles around him, and doesn't leave.)

1415
00:58:22.465 --> 00:58:24.366
(Hey, play with me.)

1416
00:58:26.275 --> 00:58:29.346
(I'm nocturnal. So I'm going to hit the sack now.)

1417
00:58:31.505 --> 00:58:33.846
(Jong Hyuk is relieved after meeting a gentle shark.)

1418
00:58:35.815 --> 00:58:38.956
(Beyond the tawny nurse shark,)

1419
00:58:38.956 --> 00:58:41.056
(a bigger shark shows itself.)

1420
00:58:42.826 --> 00:58:44.385
(It looks quite fierce.)

1421
00:58:45.726 --> 00:58:51.295
(Bull sharks are 3rd most dangerous sharks. They're aggressive.)

1422
00:58:51.295 --> 00:58:55.866
(Their name's derived from their unpredictable behaviors.)

1423
00:58:55.866 --> 00:59:02.605
(They can survive both in the fresh water and sea. They hunt alone.)

1424
00:59:04.445 --> 00:59:08.116
(A sleek shark is passing above Jong Hyun's head.)

1425
00:59:08.116 --> 00:59:16.126
(Silvertip sharks are aggressive and powerful predators.)

1426
00:59:16.126 --> 00:59:21.425
(The top part has a bronze sheen, and the lower part is white.)

1427
00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:25.866
If I were to exaggerate slightly, it was as big as a van.

1428
00:59:25.866 --> 00:59:28.596
(Bigger and fiercer sharks are coming.)

1429
00:59:28.596 --> 00:59:30.005
Perhaps, it was bigger than a bus.

1430
00:59:30.536 --> 00:59:31.536
I mean the length of it.

1431
00:59:32.036 --> 00:59:34.675
It might not have been as thick as the bus.

1432
00:59:35.746 --> 00:59:36.746
But it was humongous.

1433
00:59:36.746 --> 00:59:38.105
(Experienced divers are nervous as there are more aggressive sharks.)

1434
00:59:38.105 --> 00:59:40.016
(This is an iron rod for self-defense.)

1435
00:59:41.346 --> 00:59:45.215
(Jong Hyuk is satisfied enough to observe it up close.)

1436
00:59:49.255 --> 00:59:52.355
(He's luring the sharks with the food.)

1437
00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:59.936
(The spectators are getting more nervous.)

1438
01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:06.675
I don't think I could feed the sharks personally.

1439
01:00:07.175 --> 01:00:09.945
They put on metal gloves.

1440
01:00:09.945 --> 01:00:11.905
The gloves are made of fine-meshed met.

1441
01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:16.846
It reduces the risk of getting hurt by the shark's teeth.

1442
01:00:21.355 --> 01:00:23.726
(The bull shark approaches after smelling the food.)

1443
01:00:23.726 --> 01:00:25.326
(Chugging it down)

1444
01:00:25.326 --> 01:00:26.556
(Swallowing)

1445
01:00:29.266 --> 01:00:30.565
(Shivering with fear)

1446
01:00:34.936 --> 01:00:37.206
(This time, a larger shark appears.)

1447
01:00:37.206 --> 01:00:38.706
(Looking massive)

1448
01:00:40.235 --> 01:00:42.275
(It passes in front of Jong Hyuk.)

1449
01:00:44.206 --> 01:00:45.576
(Oh, that scared me.)

1450
01:00:48.076 --> 01:00:51.116
(This is the biggest shark seen so far.)

1451
01:00:53.556 --> 01:00:55.116
(Piercing eyes)

1452
01:00:55.826 --> 01:00:57.326
(Terrifying teeth)

1453
01:00:58.085 --> 01:01:03.496
(Sand tiger sharks are quite mild despite their scary appearance.)

1454
01:01:03.496 --> 01:01:08.335
(It's the kind of sharks that live in the aquariums the most.)

1455
01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:12.735
Let me tell you how it sounds. When you hear them chewing underwater,

1456
01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:16.706
I can hear the sharks biting the fish's head.

1457
01:01:16.846 --> 01:01:18.646
As they munch the head, they swim away.

1458
01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:22.045
It passed by right before my eyes.

1459
01:01:23.045 --> 01:01:25.215
It had a fish's head as big as this.

1460
01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:29.556
When they take out the fish's heads, the sharks come after seeing them.

1461
01:01:29.726 --> 01:01:31.126
The sharks were...

1462
01:01:32.085 --> 01:01:33.655
right in front of me.

1463
01:01:33.655 --> 01:01:34.726
(Imitating sharks)

1464
01:01:34.726 --> 01:01:35.866
They came just like this.

1465
01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:38.366
One of them was right here. It was really this close.

1466
01:01:39.565 --> 01:01:40.565
At that moment...

1467
01:01:40.565 --> 01:01:42.366
(He froze for a moment.)

1468
01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:46.605
After biting the head, it swam around.

1469
01:01:47.536 --> 01:01:48.735
I couldn't even breathe.

1470
01:01:53.746 --> 01:01:57.186
(He felt the extreme fear of sharks.)

1471
01:02:01.655 --> 01:02:05.056
(In the midst of this, he put his thumbs up.)

1472
01:02:05.056 --> 01:02:06.396
(The shark...)

1473
01:02:06.396 --> 01:02:07.626
(bit the head...)

1474
01:02:07.626 --> 01:02:08.996
(right before my eyes.)

1475
01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:10.126
(This is amazing!)

1476
01:02:11.126 --> 01:02:13.096
(They are a sand tiger shark and a tawny nurse shark.)

1477
01:02:13.235 --> 01:02:16.735
(He's slowly getting used to seeing the sharks.)

1478
01:02:16.735 --> 01:02:20.405
(By the way, who are those fish on the sharks?)

1479
01:02:20.405 --> 01:02:25.815
(Shark suckers are not sharks. They are parasitic on sharks.)

1480
01:02:25.815 --> 01:02:29.715
(They use the suckers to stay on the sharks.)

1481
01:02:32.985 --> 01:02:34.715
(My name just has the word, "shark".)

1482
01:02:38.726 --> 01:02:43.166
(At that time, the fish are suddenly moving fast.)

1483
01:02:46.235 --> 01:02:49.605
They were supposed to circle around slowly...

1484
01:02:49.605 --> 01:02:51.766
and swim among other fish.

1485
01:02:52.376 --> 01:02:54.536
And they were supposed to come and have a head of a fish.

1486
01:02:55.945 --> 01:02:59.275
But all of a sudden, it looked like all of them were in a panic.

1487
01:02:59.715 --> 01:03:02.545
They started to circle around quickly.

1488
01:03:04.945 --> 01:03:07.855
(Fish got excited after the bucket with the food had been tipped over.)

1489
01:03:13.855 --> 01:03:17.266
(The number of fish grows abnormally.)

1490
01:03:23.405 --> 01:03:27.076
(Jong Hyuk is feeling flustered.)

1491
01:03:27.076 --> 01:03:31.005
(In the back, they're trying to clean up the mess.)

1492
01:03:32.846 --> 01:03:33.976
(At that moment,)

1493
01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.786
(a bull shark comes in Jong Hyuk's direction.)

1494
01:03:35.786 --> 01:03:37.686
(They send it away with a metal stick.)

1495
01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:41.755
It was then that I realized I am much slower...

1496
01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.525
and without any weapon.

1497
01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:48.355
I could barely breathe.

1498
01:03:48.355 --> 01:03:49.965
(It keeps coming in his direction.)

1499
01:03:57.536 --> 01:03:59.076
(Roar)

1500
01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.976
(Scared)

1501
01:04:04.976 --> 01:04:07.876
(They are moving in an unusual way.)

1502
01:04:11.016 --> 01:04:12.786
It began to beat its tail...

1503
01:04:13.155 --> 01:04:15.155
and swim between the fish.

1504
01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:18.326
It was looking for a prey.

1505
01:04:18.896 --> 01:04:21.456
It came in my direction...

1506
01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:22.726
with its eyes on me.

1507
01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:25.025
The bull shark swam...

1508
01:04:25.866 --> 01:04:27.065
like this.

1509
01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:29.436
I realized that something was wrong.

1510
01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.666
When I looked at the guide, he took a step back.

1511
01:04:32.306 --> 01:04:33.476
I took a step back too.

1512
01:04:33.476 --> 01:04:34.605
(He follows the guide and puts a safe distance.)

1513
01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:37.905
They began to circle me.

1514
01:04:37.905 --> 01:04:39.045
(The sharks begin to circle the vicinity.)

1515
01:04:39.045 --> 01:04:42.815
4 or 5 sharks began to gather.

1516
01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.315
I knew something was wrong.

1517
01:04:44.616 --> 01:04:49.485
I guess the guides also thought it was a dangerous situation.

1518
01:04:49.925 --> 01:04:53.525
They kept pushing the sharks away with a metal stick.

1519
01:04:54.556 --> 01:04:56.266
They pushed the sharks away...

1520
01:04:56.795 --> 01:04:58.396
by their sides.

1521
01:04:59.166 --> 01:05:00.996
However, the sharks were undeterred.

1522
01:05:00.996 --> 01:05:01.996
(The guides keep a distance from the sharks.)

1523
01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:09.005
(Jong Hyuk falters in panic.)

1524
01:05:11.146 --> 01:05:12.945
(At that moment,)

1525
01:05:12.945 --> 01:05:16.786
(a shark swims over Jong Hyuk with a prey in its mouth.)

1526
01:05:19.885 --> 01:05:20.956
(In the history of shark feeding in Fiji,)

1527
01:05:20.956 --> 01:05:22.985
I thought moving might make me a target.

1528
01:05:24.226 --> 01:05:25.226
(there hasn't been a single accident.)

1529
01:05:25.226 --> 01:05:28.255
Right in front of me, the sharks were getting pushed away.

1530
01:05:28.255 --> 01:05:29.425
(However, he can't help but feel scared.)

1531
01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:32.795
People may have a metal stick, but sharks are stronger in water.

1532
01:05:38.565 --> 01:05:43.646
(The team chases away the sharks to swim up to the surface.)

1533
01:05:44.346 --> 01:05:46.945
(A savior's hand reaches him.)

1534
01:05:47.746 --> 01:05:49.786
(Let's go up.)

1535
01:05:51.485 --> 01:05:54.585
(Jong Hyuk gets up quickly.)

1536
01:05:56.925 --> 01:05:58.186
I was searching for an opening.

1537
01:05:59.096 --> 01:06:01.755
When a few sharks were pushed away, I rose to the surface.

1538
01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:06.166
When I realized that I was safe again,

1539
01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:07.295
I could breathe again.

1540
01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:09.735
I mean...

1541
01:06:10.835 --> 01:06:13.405
The guides might experience it frequently,

1542
01:06:13.405 --> 01:06:14.905
but it was my first time experiencing something like that.

1543
01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:17.476
It was an experience of the lifetime.

1544
01:06:18.146 --> 01:06:19.846
When would I see sharks again...

1545
01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:24.286
right before my eyes?

1546
01:06:24.945 --> 01:06:26.516
(Biting)

1547
01:06:27.155 --> 01:06:28.155
It was an experience of the lifetime.

1548
01:06:29.456 --> 01:06:32.056
(He safely returns to the surface.)

1549
01:06:39.266 --> 01:06:41.366
(Amazed)

1550
01:06:42.366 --> 01:06:43.536
Sharks are sharks.

1551
01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:47.076
The final moment was...

1552
01:06:47.076 --> 01:06:48.206
(He feels all kinds of emotions.)

1553
01:06:48.206 --> 01:06:49.206
I mean...

1554
01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:54.315
They were like the sharks in "Jaws".

1555
01:06:56.385 --> 01:06:57.545
I saw those sharks.

1556
01:06:59.485 --> 01:07:03.086
There were more than 10 sharks circling above me.

1557
01:07:03.655 --> 01:07:06.826
I moved back a little...

1558
01:07:06.826 --> 01:07:09.366
and my legs float in water.

1559
01:07:10.265 --> 01:07:11.966
(He had a thrilling meeting with the 4 kinds of sharks.)

1560
01:07:11.966 --> 01:07:14.466
I am a bit proud of myself.

1561
01:07:15.336 --> 01:07:16.636
You succeeded in completing the mission.

1562
01:07:16.636 --> 01:07:18.105
I succeeded.

1563
01:07:18.105 --> 01:07:20.105
(Jong Hyuk succeeds in completing the shark feeding.)

1564
01:07:20.206 --> 01:07:22.445
I wish I could have fed them myself.

1565
01:07:22.445 --> 01:07:24.076
(Thank you for your hard work, Jong Hyuk.)

1566
01:07:25.576 --> 01:07:29.046
Meanwhile, Dindin and Da Rae set out to search for food.

1567
01:07:29.046 --> 01:07:30.046
Let's go.

1568
01:07:31.345 --> 01:07:32.886
As the Chief,

1569
01:07:34.055 --> 01:07:35.555
I will give you cassava as soon as I find it.

1570
01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:38.826
- I know what sugar cane looks like. - I want to eat sugar cane.

1571
01:07:38.826 --> 01:07:39.826
(Dindin has been to the jungle...)

1572
01:07:39.826 --> 01:07:42.426
(while Da Rae hasn't.)

1573
01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:43.496
There is nothing.

1574
01:07:46.136 --> 01:07:47.636
- Bananas! - Where?

1575
01:07:47.895 --> 01:07:48.966
Bananas!

1576
01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.605
- Look at those. - There are bananas.

1577
01:07:51.605 --> 01:07:52.775
This is incredible.

1578
01:07:52.905 --> 01:07:54.876
I brought a rope for a moment like this.

1579
01:07:55.676 --> 01:07:57.676
(A rope?)

1580
01:07:58.876 --> 01:08:00.275
I will show you why I am the Chief.

1581
01:08:00.275 --> 01:08:02.746
Let me untie this.

1582
01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:03.746
(Is it a weapon of his?)

1583
01:08:04.586 --> 01:08:06.555
(I, Chief Dindin will get food...)

1584
01:08:06.555 --> 01:08:07.655
(and recover my honor.)

1585
01:08:07.655 --> 01:08:08.855
- Untie it. - Untie it.

1586
01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:12.456
I need to do more than untie it. Anyone can untie a rope.

1587
01:08:13.826 --> 01:08:16.065
Putting it at the end adds a weight.

1588
01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:19.666
Now, I can use it...

1589
01:08:19.666 --> 01:08:21.496
to adjust the direction.

1590
01:08:22.435 --> 01:08:24.636
(Chief Dindin has a special way of harvesting bananas.)

1591
01:08:25.775 --> 01:08:27.435
(He is set.)

1592
01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:29.905
You added a weight to the rope.

1593
01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:31.805
(Take this.)

1594
01:08:31.805 --> 01:08:36.345
(It flies into the air and comes back to Dindin.)

1595
01:08:37.445 --> 01:08:39.355
Dindin, that will never work.

1596
01:08:39.485 --> 01:08:41.555
- Do you want to try it? - What is it, a boomerang?

1597
01:08:41.855 --> 01:08:44.225
- Wait a minute. - I think they are within our reach.

1598
01:08:44.225 --> 01:08:46.256
I will be able to get them when I step on this.

1599
01:08:47.095 --> 01:08:48.655
(Distrustful)

1600
01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:50.725
I am the Chief.

1601
01:08:51.025 --> 01:08:52.395
(Struggling)

1602
01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:53.895
I won't let you starve.

1603
01:08:54.466 --> 01:08:56.435
(He has pride as the Chief.)

1604
01:08:57.706 --> 01:08:58.935
(He is using his legs.)

1605
01:08:58.935 --> 01:09:01.506
- Be careful. Do you want support? - No. Give me a minute.

1606
01:09:02.036 --> 01:09:04.076
(I am Chief Dindin.)

1607
01:09:04.076 --> 01:09:05.515
Be careful.

1608
01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.046
- Here. - Nice.

1609
01:09:07.616 --> 01:09:09.086
- All right. - Nice.

1610
01:09:10.716 --> 01:09:13.256
I think the upper ones are tasty.

1611
01:09:13.256 --> 01:09:14.386
(How does Chief Dindin feel about getting food?)

1612
01:09:14.386 --> 01:09:17.185
When I picked a hand of bananas,

1613
01:09:17.855 --> 01:09:19.855
I did it in a cool way like the real chief.

1614
01:09:19.926 --> 01:09:22.725
I heard that many celebrities go out thanks to The Law of Jungle.

1615
01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:25.565
Is this it? Is this what it feels like?

1616
01:09:25.565 --> 01:09:29.565
Did you fall for him after seeing him pick bananas?

1617
01:09:29.935 --> 01:09:31.666
I thought it was a pitiful sight.

1618
01:09:32.105 --> 01:09:34.905
The banana tree was...

1619
01:09:35.305 --> 01:09:37.905
bigger than I expected.

1620
01:09:38.546 --> 01:09:40.945
I was worried that his feet wouldn't reach the ground.

1621
01:09:41.576 --> 01:09:43.716
I was worried.

1622
01:09:43.916 --> 01:09:44.916
Be careful.

1623
01:09:44.916 --> 01:09:46.485
(He axes in a pitiful way.)

1624
01:09:48.055 --> 01:09:49.725
- Do you want me to do it? - No, I don't want you to get hurt.

1625
01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:52.155
(If you really want to do it...)

1626
01:09:52.155 --> 01:09:53.155
Do you want to try it?

1627
01:09:53.155 --> 01:09:54.756
(They exchange places.)

1628
01:09:55.595 --> 01:09:57.395
That's the spot.

1629
01:09:57.395 --> 01:10:01.065
Put your right foot in there. Step up with your left foot.

1630
01:10:01.065 --> 01:10:03.366
(She begins with her left foot.)

1631
01:10:04.036 --> 01:10:06.805
I will look bad if you do a good job.

1632
01:10:07.775 --> 01:10:09.145
- Okay. - Are you in place?

1633
01:10:09.145 --> 01:10:10.376
- Yes. - Are you balanced?

1634
01:10:11.345 --> 01:10:12.616
(She axes without hesitation.)

1635
01:10:12.616 --> 01:10:14.315
This ax is nice.

1636
01:10:14.515 --> 01:10:15.845
(Da Rae, don't do this.)

1637
01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.485
(She kills it with one shot.)

1638
01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:20.586
You did it.

1639
01:10:20.685 --> 01:10:22.155
- Gosh, that was exhausting. - You didn't get hurt, right?

1640
01:10:22.155 --> 01:10:23.225
- No, I didn't. - Come back down.

1641
01:10:23.225 --> 01:10:24.256
Thank you.

1642
01:10:24.256 --> 01:10:25.695
(My goodness.)

1643
01:10:25.695 --> 01:10:28.126
I have nothing to do as the chief.

1644
01:10:28.595 --> 01:10:29.626
I guess so.

1645
01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:31.395
This is good.

1646
01:10:32.025 --> 01:10:34.796
- This is good. - This is good.

1647
01:10:34.796 --> 01:10:36.536
- This is good. - This is amazing.

1648
01:10:37.136 --> 01:10:38.765
Let's take them.

1649
01:10:39.076 --> 01:10:40.435
- This is good. - This is good.

1650
01:10:40.435 --> 01:10:41.506
This is our first find.

1651
01:10:41.506 --> 01:10:43.905
- This is our first find. - We are off to a good start.

1652
01:10:44.605 --> 01:10:47.116
Shall we look for cassavas?

1653
01:10:47.116 --> 01:10:48.746
I know what cassavas look like.

1654
01:10:49.046 --> 01:10:50.616
There has to be sugar cane.

1655
01:10:50.616 --> 01:10:52.256
I really want to eat sugar cane.

1656
01:10:53.685 --> 01:10:55.855
What is that on the tree?

1657
01:10:55.855 --> 01:10:58.485
What? You found them.

1658
01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:00.826
There they are.

1659
01:11:00.826 --> 01:11:01.826
There.

1660
01:11:02.565 --> 01:11:05.296
We can take these three.

1661
01:11:05.296 --> 01:11:06.565
(Cut nut is juicy and tasty.)

1662
01:11:07.036 --> 01:11:09.405
It's time to use the rope.

1663
01:11:09.805 --> 01:11:12.275
Let's use the rope.

1664
01:11:14.735 --> 01:11:16.405
I saw this in a movie.

1665
01:11:16.546 --> 01:11:18.645
- All right. It worked. - Did it work?

1666
01:11:19.945 --> 01:11:22.786
It worked. Look at this.

1667
01:11:22.786 --> 01:11:24.586
- In 1, 2. - In 1, 2, 3.

1668
01:11:25.315 --> 01:11:26.716
Okay.

1669
01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:29.055
- Three. - Okay.

1670
01:11:29.055 --> 01:11:31.225

1671
01:11:31.926 --> 01:11:33.256
- It was really cool. - That was amazing.

1672
01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:34.725
- Okay. - Okay. Let's get it.

1673
01:11:34.725 --> 01:11:36.065
- Okay. - Let's get more.

1674
01:11:36.065 --> 01:11:37.195
Shall we take get those ones too?

1675
01:11:37.195 --> 01:11:39.595
- Shall we get three more? - There are three of us.

1676
01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:40.636
Okay.

1677
01:11:40.836 --> 01:11:41.866
(Chief Dindin will get them.)

1678
01:11:41.866 --> 01:11:42.935
Okay.

1679
01:11:43.605 --> 01:11:44.636
(Binding)

1680
01:11:44.636 --> 01:11:45.836
Let's get it.

1681
01:11:45.836 --> 01:11:48.006
(He throws it with accuracy.)

1682
01:11:48.006 --> 01:11:50.376
(It lands in his right hand.)

1683
01:11:50.376 --> 01:11:52.275
What was that?

1684
01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:53.275

1685
01:11:53.945 --> 01:11:56.046
- I am Chief Dindin. - He caught it right away.

1686
01:11:56.046 --> 01:11:59.956
I won't let you starve. I won't let you starve today.

1687
01:11:59.956 --> 01:12:01.815
You are the Chief.

1688
01:12:03.225 --> 01:12:04.786
This should be in the best one minute of the program.

1689
01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:08.225
Is there anything to eat on the ground?

1690
01:12:08.326 --> 01:12:09.366
(They resume their search.)

1691
01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:11.195
There must be root vegetables.

1692
01:12:12.195 --> 01:12:14.095
- What is it? - What is that?

1693

(Da Rae's scream makes Chief Dindin see it too.)

1695

1699

(Next week)

1701

What should we do?
