00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:39.525
There are cruel moments you never want...

2
00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:41.295
to encounter in life.

3
00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:44.594
- Please calm down. - He's my brother!

4
00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:45.665
Just a second, please.

5
00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:48.905
And those cruel moments are always...

6
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.405
preceded by choices that brought them about.

7
00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:57.305
Yes, I'm Mr. Park Jun Mo's daughter, Park So Yoon.

8
00:00:58.204 --> 00:00:59.545
I just want to know...

9
00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:01.614
what's going on with my dad's case.

10
00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:04.114
We received the injured party's request not to punish him,

11
00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:06.155
so we'll probably be told to drop the case soon.

12
00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:11.655
I see. Thank you.

(Episode 3)

14
00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:29.605
And those little choices come back...

15
00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:33.314
as regrets and haunt us later on in life.

16
00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:38.914
If we can alter those seemingly insignificant choices,

17
00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.685
we might be able to prevent such cruel moments.

Seung Won.

20
00:01:50.094 --> 00:01:52.264
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

21
00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:55.564
Let go. Just pretend you never saw me.

22
00:01:55.564 --> 00:01:58.634
Don't be like this. Let's go talk to the police or the prosecution.

23
00:01:58.735 --> 00:01:59.805
There must be a way.

24
00:01:59.805 --> 00:02:01.004
There's nothing we can do.

25
00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:04.375
I heard that the prosecutor will bury everything.

26
00:02:04.944 --> 00:02:07.175
He's dumb, and he works unnecessarily hard.

27
00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:10.185
Who's that dumb and unnecessarily hard-working prosecutor?

28
00:02:11.044 --> 00:02:12.354
Who's Seung Won?

29
00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:15.455
He's my brother. Why do you ask?

30
00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:19.995
In my dream, a guy named Seung Won...

31
00:02:22.064 --> 00:02:23.625
killed someone.

32
00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:25.995
Sorry?

33
00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:28.194
His name is Jung Jae Chan?

34
00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:30.365
That's right. Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan.

35
00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:32.705
He's colluding with the attorney.

36
00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:34.474
That can't be.

37
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:36.044
What do you mean?

38
00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:37.645
That prosecutor is...

39
00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:42.115
my brother.

40
00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:45.585
What?

41
00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:50.884
(Jae Chan)

42
00:02:55.824 --> 00:02:56.824
Is he not picking up?

43
00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:06.235
Jae Chan.

44
00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:11.004
So Yoon. It's me, Mom.

45
00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:13.574
Do you want to sleep over at Sung Hee's place tonight?

46
00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:19.414
Mom and Dad have to talk about something today.

47
00:03:19.814 --> 00:03:21.814
Why can't I be home?

48
00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:24.585
Mom, Mom.

49
00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:29.564
So Yoon!

50
00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:32.664
Please.

51
00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:34.465
Seung Won.

52
00:03:35.305 --> 00:03:36.634
Keep yourself together!

53
00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:40.675
You said you had a dream too, right?

54
00:03:40.904 --> 00:03:42.245
Let's see if our dreams match.

55
00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:44.805
- When was it? - Tonight.

56
00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:46.644
Both of us are wearing the outfits I saw in the dream.

57
00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:48.375
That means we don't have much time.

58
00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:49.685
Tell me about your dream in detail.

59
00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:53.384
It looked like a rich family's living room.

60
00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:55.584
There was a piano at the center.

61
00:03:56.254 --> 00:03:57.285
A piano?

62
00:03:58.225 --> 00:04:01.055
Yes. A married couple fought there.

63
00:04:01.154 --> 00:04:03.024
No, I can't really say that they fought.

64
00:04:03.024 --> 00:04:05.295
It looked like the woman was getting beaten up by her husband.

65
00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:07.764
Mom!

66
00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:10.605
Their daughter and Seung Won came in right at that moment.

67
00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:12.375
Please stop, sir!

68
00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:13.834
Who are you supposed to be?

69
00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:22.814
Seung Won, watch out!

70
00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:29.685
Then while trying to stop the fight, Seung Won...

71
00:04:38.165 --> 00:04:40.264
He ended up pushing the husband off the balcony.

72
00:05:06.894 --> 00:05:08.564
This is all your fault.

73
00:05:09.694 --> 00:05:12.264
I became a murderer because of you.

74
00:05:12.535 --> 00:05:14.295
He resented his brother.

75
00:05:14.535 --> 00:05:17.365
He said he became a murderer because of his brother.

76
00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:21.675
Why is it your fault though?

77
00:05:25.314 --> 00:05:26.314
Could it be...

78
00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:28.514
about the Park Jun Mo case?

79
00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:30.644
The Park Jun Mo case?

80
00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.814
My friend is having a piano recital today. Do you want to go?

81
00:05:34.814 --> 00:05:36.685
You know the piano prodigy, Park So Yoon, right?

82
00:05:36.855 --> 00:05:38.824
- He's her dad. - Accused, Park Jun Mo.

83
00:05:38.824 --> 00:05:42.194
The injured party does not wish the accused to be punished.

84
00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:44.824
Therefore, the case is unprosecutable.

85
00:05:45.064 --> 00:05:47.665
The end. My gosh! It didn't even take five minutes.

86
00:05:50.805 --> 00:05:52.904
That's why he said it's my fault.

87
00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:54.435
It's because I let Park Jun Mo go.

88
00:05:56.144 --> 00:05:59.245
Do you happen to remember where that apartment building was?

89
00:06:07.754 --> 00:06:10.425
I saw two moons from the window.

91
00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:42.785
Hey, Woo Tak. Can you relieve me?

92
00:06:44.024 --> 00:06:46.995
Gosh, what on earth does he do every night?

93
00:06:50.925 --> 00:06:52.095
Who killed him?

94
00:06:52.095 --> 00:06:53.435
His wife? His daughter?

95
00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:55.904
No, it was a young man who went into their place to stop the fight.

96
00:06:56.264 --> 00:06:57.264
There he is.

97
00:06:57.504 --> 00:07:00.204
My goodness, he's still so young.

98
00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:02.375
Gosh, he's very handsome too.

99
00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:03.904
My goodness.

100
00:07:06.644 --> 00:07:11.115
Well... I was just trying to help my friend's mother.

101
00:07:14.214 --> 00:07:15.884
Seung Won, Seung Won!

102
00:07:15.884 --> 00:07:18.555
Jae Chan, get me out. I didn't kill him, Jae Chan.

103
00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:20.555
Just a second, Officer. Wait.

104
00:07:20.995 --> 00:07:22.165
- Sir. - Stop!

105
00:07:22.165 --> 00:07:23.795
- You can't be doing this. - He's my brother.

106
00:07:23.795 --> 00:07:25.064
- Please calm down. - He's my brother!

107
00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:26.634
Let go of me, please!

108
00:07:26.665 --> 00:07:27.935
Sir, you can't do this!

109

Are you up?

110
00:07:34.574 --> 00:07:35.675
I didn't sleep.

111

Wipe your mouth first.

112
00:07:37.004 --> 00:07:38.004
Okay.

113
00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:41.214
Shall I drive, Kyung Han?

114
00:07:41.274 --> 00:07:42.285
Yes.

115
00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:51.625
Is your stomach upset?

116
00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:55.225
Is it because of the oysters I ate earlier? Why is my stomach turning?

117
00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:59.134
Why don't you use the washroom at the patrol division?

118
00:07:59.394 --> 00:08:00.394
All right.

119
00:08:10.575 --> 00:08:11.575
That's...

What's the matter?

121
00:08:14.575 --> 00:08:16.085
It's nothing.

122
00:08:16.485 --> 00:08:18.884
Let's hurry. Come on.

123
00:08:29.595 --> 00:08:32.095
You would've killed that man had I not stopped the car.

What am I? UNICEF? Mother Teresa?

132
00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:07.164
We put it down in writing earlier.

133
00:09:07.264 --> 00:09:09.804
You said you'd do anything I ask of you if I write that statement.

134
00:09:10.465 --> 00:09:13.034
You're talking as if you deserve all this for scribbling that thing.

135
00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:15.804
Both the prosecutor and the law are on my side now.

136
00:09:17.575 --> 00:09:19.274
Why would I do this for you?

137
00:09:25.044 --> 00:09:26.455
Do you know why the law is on my side?

138
00:09:27.014 --> 00:09:28.014
Even if I do this...

139
00:09:40.134 --> 00:09:41.294
Even if I do all this...

140
00:09:48.404 --> 00:09:50.745
No one can touch me at all. Do you know why that is?

141
00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:53.115
It's because everything here including you is mine.

142

I can do whatever I want with what's mine.

143

The law knows it very well because it's fair.

144

I'll get the forms again.

149

- What's all this fuss about? - It was so loud.

150
00:11:16.524 --> 00:11:17.524
I know, right?

151
00:11:17.524 --> 00:11:19.735

Let's go over there.

158

It's so chilly. What on earth is going on?

159
00:11:32.144 --> 00:11:33.975
- Someone pressed it? - Did somebody file a false report?

160
00:11:34.774 --> 00:11:37.684
You pressed the fire alarm, didn't you? I saw you pressing it earlier.

161
00:11:38.085 --> 00:11:41.455
Well, I thought I saw some smoke.

162
00:11:41.455 --> 00:11:42.554
Don't you smell something burning?

163
00:11:43.284 --> 00:11:44.485
I don't smell anything.

164

Where did you see the smoke?

165

I think she pulled a prank.

Miss, did you file a false report or not?

167

I really saw it.

168
00:11:56.304 --> 00:11:58.434
Was it over there?

169
00:11:58.975 --> 00:12:00.304
Was it coming from the back?

170
00:12:00.735 --> 00:12:03.245
I saw it too. I mean, the smoke.

171
00:12:04.004 --> 00:12:06.845
So, it's not a false report.

172
00:12:14.855 --> 00:12:15.985
What should we do, then?

173
00:12:22.024 --> 00:12:24.595
I clearly told you to go straight home.

174
00:12:24.664 --> 00:12:25.695
Why didn't you listen to me?

175
00:12:25.965 --> 00:12:27.335
I had a reason.

176
00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:29.404
If you let me explain, you'll understand why...

177
00:12:29.404 --> 00:12:31.605
I already know that your friend is Park Jun Mo's daughter.

178
00:12:31.804 --> 00:12:33.475
And you're here because you were worried about her.

179
00:12:33.575 --> 00:12:35.644
You know? And you're still being like this?

180
00:12:35.644 --> 00:12:37.304
Was I supposed to turn a blind eye or what?

181
00:12:37.304 --> 00:12:40.445
Yes, turn a blind eye! You'll get hurt if you get involved.

182
00:12:42.144 --> 00:12:43.315
And why didn't you pick up?

183
00:12:43.544 --> 00:12:45.815
I couldn't answer your call because I was so ashamed of you!

184
00:12:46.955 --> 00:12:48.684
- What? - Turn a blind eye?

185
00:12:48.855 --> 00:12:51.154
Even if something horrible could've happened to my friend?

186
00:12:51.154 --> 00:12:53.254
How can you say that? You shouldn't even call yourself a prosecutor!

187
00:12:53.254 --> 00:12:55.125
You would've killed him hadn't I intervened.

188
00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:56.794
That's not what you should be saying!

189
00:12:57.625 --> 00:12:58.894
You should admit your fault...

190
00:12:58.995 --> 00:13:01.195
and apologize for being a clueless prosecutor.

191
00:13:02.434 --> 00:13:04.065
"I'll investigate it properly."

192
00:13:04.235 --> 00:13:05.804
"Just trust me. You don't have to worry."

193
00:13:05.804 --> 00:13:07.434
That's what a prosecutor should be saying!

194
00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:11.644
You're my big brother, right?

195
00:13:17.845 --> 00:13:19.184
A prosecutor is nothing special after all.

196
00:13:19.884 --> 00:13:21.455
As a brother, you're really nothing special.

197
00:13:26.154 --> 00:13:28.695
That's right. I'm nothing special.

198
00:13:28.924 --> 00:13:31.524
But you're even more insignificant than me.

199
00:13:32.434 --> 00:13:35.095
Even I will get in trouble if I act up. Who do you think you are?

200
00:13:35.235 --> 00:13:37.235
I'm seriously so ashamed of you.

201
00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:38.934
That's better than you getting hurt.

202
00:13:39.904 --> 00:13:41.504
Don't get involved in So Yoon's problems.

203
00:13:52.085 --> 00:13:54.554
You should sleep at Sung Hee's place tonight.

204
00:13:54.554 --> 00:13:56.225
It's too late.

205
00:13:56.355 --> 00:13:57.684
And what about you?

206
00:13:57.725 --> 00:13:59.125
I'm fine.

207
00:14:00.225 --> 00:14:01.855
Let's go to my place.

208
00:14:02.465 --> 00:14:04.424
- Sorry? - Who are you?

209
00:14:04.424 --> 00:14:05.965
I'm your friend's brother's girlfriend.

210
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.695
Let's get out of here before your husband sees you.

211
00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:08.965
Geum Sook!

212
00:14:09.205 --> 00:14:10.235
Let's go.

213
00:14:10.865 --> 00:14:12.004
So Yoon!

214
00:14:13.674 --> 00:14:14.975
Geum Sook!

215
00:14:16.945 --> 00:14:18.144
So Yoon!

216
00:14:22.284 --> 00:14:23.815
It's so hard to hail a taxi here.

217
00:14:25.455 --> 00:14:27.855
There are many other places we can go.

218
00:14:28.154 --> 00:14:29.825
Really? Where?

219
00:14:30.054 --> 00:14:31.754
Tell me. I'll take you there.

220
00:14:32.024 --> 00:14:34.595
Well, I just thought you should know...

221
00:14:34.754 --> 00:14:36.164
that there are many other places we can go.

222
00:14:37.195 --> 00:14:38.225
What?

223
00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:42.534
Kyung Han, I actually had...

224
00:14:43.065 --> 00:14:44.965
a really strange dream earlier.

225
00:14:45.335 --> 00:14:47.075
- In the dream, I saw... - I can't...

226
00:14:47.705 --> 00:14:49.945
believe this situation right now.

227
00:14:50.075 --> 00:14:52.575
Woo Tak, I really have to go to the bathroom.

228
00:14:53.514 --> 00:14:55.815
We'll get there very soon. Just hold it for five more minutes.

229
00:14:55.815 --> 00:14:58.554
Five more minutes? No, my muscles down there...

230
00:15:00.414 --> 00:15:02.585
I can't even hold it for another minute.

231
00:15:02.784 --> 00:15:03.825
Let's hurry.

232
00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:13.934
Hey, what's going on?

233
00:15:13.934 --> 00:15:16.664
Why are you pulling over? Why?

234
00:15:21.335 --> 00:15:23.475
Hey, what now? What's happening?

235
00:15:24.705 --> 00:15:25.774
What are you doing here?

236
00:15:25.774 --> 00:15:26.911
We have to go home,

237
00:15:26.936 --> 00:15:28.369
but there's no bus at this hour.

238
00:15:28.945 --> 00:15:30.215
We can't seem to hail a taxi either.

239
00:15:30.345 --> 00:15:32.715
- Which way are you going? - I really have to go.

240
00:15:33.254 --> 00:15:34.884
The washroom at the patrol division...

241
00:15:35.115 --> 00:15:36.384
I live near Sangku-dong.

242
00:15:36.424 --> 00:15:39.254
Please get in. We're going that way on patrol anyway.

243
00:15:41.794 --> 00:15:42.965
Thank you.

244
00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:44.995
I can't believe this.

245
00:16:08.414 --> 00:16:09.585
We've met before, haven't we?

246
00:16:10.225 --> 00:16:11.225
Sorry?

247
00:16:11.585 --> 00:16:13.894
Don't you remember me? On Valentine's Day,

248
00:16:15.095 --> 00:16:17.065
we almost got into a huge accident, you know.

249
00:16:19.365 --> 00:16:23.164
That's right. No wonder why you looked familiar.

250
00:16:26.805 --> 00:16:30.505
Oh, it's not what you're thinking. He meant a car accident.

251
00:16:32.214 --> 00:16:34.045
You're a police officer.

252
00:16:34.414 --> 00:16:37.184
I didn't even get to thank you that day as I was so out of it.

253
00:16:37.184 --> 00:16:38.914
Don't worry. It's okay.

254
00:16:41.984 --> 00:16:42.984
I'm...

255
00:16:45.154 --> 00:16:46.494
not okay.

256
00:16:56.204 --> 00:16:57.464
I'm sorry...

257
00:16:58.365 --> 00:17:00.204
to inconvenience you like this.

258
00:17:00.934 --> 00:17:03.704
Hong Joo told me briefly about what happened.

259
00:17:04.605 --> 00:17:07.075
So Yoon, what are you doing?

260
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:09.984
Are there only two rooms?

261
00:17:10.714 --> 00:17:13.414
You two can use the master bedroom. I can sleep in Hong Joo's room.

262
00:17:13.414 --> 00:17:16.224
It's okay. I think my mom and I should sleep in the living room.

263
00:17:16.424 --> 00:17:17.884
Forget it. It gets cold here.

264
00:17:17.884 --> 00:17:19.924
You don't need to feel bad. Just sleep in the master bedroom.

265
00:17:20.025 --> 00:17:22.825
I'm not saying it because I feel bad. I prefer to sleep on the floor.

266
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.295
And my mom would prefer to sleep on the couch. Right, Mom?

267
00:17:25.694 --> 00:17:26.694
What?

268
00:17:27.535 --> 00:17:29.065
Yes, of course.

269
00:17:29.404 --> 00:17:31.265
I would prefer to sleep on the couch.

270
00:17:31.335 --> 00:17:34.505
Then I'll go bring a heating mat. You should sleep on it.

271
00:17:34.535 --> 00:17:36.075
Otherwise, the cold floor will paralyze your face.

272
00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:38.005
I told you. I like sleeping on bare floor.

273
00:17:38.575 --> 00:17:40.115
Hong Joo, then go bring the heater.

274
00:17:40.115 --> 00:17:42.115
No, it's okay.

275
00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:44.884
My skin is dry, and heaters make it so much worse.

276
00:17:46.154 --> 00:17:48.825
She's not that sociable because she's an only child.

277
00:17:49.224 --> 00:17:51.625
- I'm sorry. - Gosh, don't be.

278
00:17:51.684 --> 00:17:55.125
My only child also has dry skin, so I certainly know what it's like.

279
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:06.381
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E05 While You Were Sleeping "Secretly, Greatly"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

280
00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:17.644
I'm honestly so embarrassed.

281
00:18:17.884 --> 00:18:19.585
I'm too embarrassed of Jae Chan...

282
00:18:19.585 --> 00:18:22.154
to even walk around in this neighborhood.

283
00:18:22.154 --> 00:18:23.884
Honey, calm down.

284
00:18:23.884 --> 00:18:26.555
Calm down and put that briquette down first.

285
00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:29.825
We can talk about it, okay? Don't scare us like this.

286
00:18:29.825 --> 00:18:32.664
I'm scaring you? You find this scary?

287
00:18:32.795 --> 00:18:35.734
To me, money is scarier.

288
00:18:35.734 --> 00:18:37.904
That idiot got ripped off, and he now owes them 5,000 dollars.

289
00:18:37.904 --> 00:18:40.434
That scares me a million times more than anything else does.

290
00:18:40.535 --> 00:18:41.575
5,000 dollars...

291
00:18:42.505 --> 00:18:45.414
Strictly speaking, if we think about compensating them for all damages...

292
00:18:45.414 --> 00:18:47.015
done to the property and the business,

293
00:18:47.015 --> 00:18:48.714
5,000 dollars sounds pretty reasonable.

294
00:18:48.845 --> 00:18:52.384
It is right that the offender pays the money.

295
00:18:53.555 --> 00:18:56.625
Is that so? Then shall we talk about what's really right and wrong?

296
00:18:56.924 --> 00:18:59.325
Our eldest son fooled us and practically stole...

297
00:18:59.325 --> 00:19:01.224
money from us to buy his motorcycle.

298
00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:03.464
Then he drove into a store and caused all this damage!

299
00:19:03.765 --> 00:19:06.464
And you. I have to work so hard because you get paid peanuts.

300
00:19:06.464 --> 00:19:09.505
Considering everything, you two deserve a death sentence!

301
00:19:09.634 --> 00:19:12.805
Fine, let's all die today!

302
00:19:13.974 --> 00:19:15.474
Gosh, what should we do?

303
00:19:15.474 --> 00:19:16.474
- Oh, no! - My gosh!

304
00:19:16.644 --> 00:19:17.674
Goodness!

305
00:19:17.674 --> 00:19:18.944
Honey, this is... Gosh, it's so hot!

306
00:19:18.944 --> 00:19:20.944
The floor... My goodness.

307
00:19:20.944 --> 00:19:22.315
- What are you doing, Mom? - Gosh.

308
00:19:22.315 --> 00:19:25.255
You said we should all die. Are you that worried about the floor?

309
00:19:27.184 --> 00:19:28.825
Get out.

310
00:19:28.825 --> 00:19:31.285
I can't even stand the sight of you, so get out!

311
00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:33.125
- Get out right now! - Honey!

312
00:19:33.224 --> 00:19:34.394
- Get out! - Gosh.

313
00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:54.875
Hey, Seung Won.

314
00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.384
Mom told me to tell you that she didn't send these.

315
00:19:58.714 --> 00:20:01.015
Jae Chan. Try to behave yourself, okay?

316
00:20:01.615 --> 00:20:02.654
You little...

317
00:20:09.265 --> 00:20:10.265
Seung Won.

318
00:20:18.464 --> 00:20:19.535
Are you asleep?

319
00:20:46.164 --> 00:20:47.365
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:49.204 --> 00:20:51.734
You must've resented me a lot earlier at the substation.

321
00:20:56.045 --> 00:20:57.575
It's all because I'm incompetent.

322
00:20:59.144 --> 00:21:00.744
Because I'm so incompetent,

323
00:21:01.644 --> 00:21:03.214
I have too many regrets.

324
00:21:06.654 --> 00:21:08.884
I just don't want you to turn out like me.

325
00:21:10.654 --> 00:21:11.825
I want you...

326
00:21:12.525 --> 00:21:14.994
to have a much better life.

327
00:21:16.365 --> 00:21:18.295
I guess that's why my expectations keep getting higher.

328
00:21:22.204 --> 00:21:26.204
I want you to be taller than me.

329
00:21:28.775 --> 00:21:30.174
I want you to own a car...

330
00:21:30.904 --> 00:21:33.075
even if I commute by bus.

331
00:21:35.684 --> 00:21:37.545
I've never been on an airplane,

332
00:21:38.144 --> 00:21:42.924
but I want you to fly first class all the time.

333
00:21:45.394 --> 00:21:47.255
I started my career as a Grade Nine public official,

334
00:21:47.255 --> 00:21:50.224
so I want you to start at a higher level.

335
00:21:55.065 --> 00:21:57.605
You probably manipulated your report cards like that...

336
00:21:59.275 --> 00:22:00.634
because you felt...

337
00:22:01.805 --> 00:22:04.345
smothered by my expectations of you.

338
00:22:08.984 --> 00:22:10.815
I'm sorry I stressed you out.

339
00:22:13.884 --> 00:22:15.325
I'm an incompetent dad.

340
00:22:17.585 --> 00:22:18.654
I'm sorry.

341
00:23:25.025 --> 00:23:28.565
Gosh, seriously. I can't believe myself.

342
00:23:28.565 --> 00:23:30.325
Am I sexually frustrated or what?

343
00:23:30.795 --> 00:23:32.994
A kiss? And it was...

344
00:23:33.865 --> 00:23:35.305
I kissed him first?

345
00:23:36.434 --> 00:23:39.805
That's so wrong. It makes me look so pathetic!

346
00:23:48.585 --> 00:23:51.644
I can only eat food my mom makes.

347
00:23:51.644 --> 00:23:53.115
I can't function without my mom's food.

348
00:23:53.484 --> 00:23:56.424
Please have a seat. We put a couple extra sets of cutlery.

349
00:23:56.454 --> 00:23:59.394
Oh, I see. Thank you.

350
00:24:00.724 --> 00:24:02.365
Mom, where's the toilet plunger?

351
00:24:02.494 --> 00:24:04.295
The toilet is clogged.

352
00:24:04.464 --> 00:24:08.234
It looks like a cow took a big dump in there!

353
00:24:12.075 --> 00:24:13.305
It's not mine.

354
00:24:13.835 --> 00:24:16.174
Hey, I'll unclog it later. Just come out.

355
00:24:16.345 --> 00:24:17.545
Hurry up!

356
00:24:17.704 --> 00:24:20.144
We're inconveniencing you so much.

357
00:24:20.144 --> 00:24:23.085
Oh, no. Not at all. I'll just think that the poop is mine...

358
00:24:23.085 --> 00:24:26.484
I mean, please don't worry and just make yourselves at home.

359
00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:28.825
Relax. Oh, thank you.

360
00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:34.355
Thank you.

361
00:24:37.595 --> 00:24:38.994
Let's try to relax.

362
00:24:47.134 --> 00:24:48.674
Gosh, it's so hot!

363
00:24:53.345 --> 00:24:54.714
My gosh.

364
00:25:08.595 --> 00:25:09.795
Have breakfast before you go.

365
00:25:09.795 --> 00:25:10.825
I have no appetite.

366
00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:14.394
Since when did he care about things like that?

367
00:25:17.164 --> 00:25:19.505
I'll never become a prosecutor.

368
00:25:19.505 --> 00:25:21.075
Goodness, don't you worry.

369
00:25:21.075 --> 00:25:23.444
You'll never be able to become one with the grades you've been getting.

370
00:25:25.045 --> 00:25:27.115
My, this is so delicious.

371
00:25:27.615 --> 00:25:29.315
Are you really not going to eat? You'll regret it.

372
00:25:35.355 --> 00:25:36.924
Gosh, he's such a brat.

373
00:25:39.154 --> 00:25:41.555
How about you try trusting that prosecutor?

374
00:25:44.095 --> 00:25:46.065
Yes, just trust him...

375
00:25:46.065 --> 00:25:48.634
and stay here until the case gets resolved.

376
00:25:49.265 --> 00:25:51.335
The case is already closed.

377
00:25:52.075 --> 00:25:54.204
The prosecutor has decided not to indict my husband.

378
00:25:54.734 --> 00:25:56.204
I actually asked him about it.

379
00:25:56.404 --> 00:25:58.674
The assistant chief prosecutor hasn't approved it,

380
00:25:58.674 --> 00:26:00.075
so the case isn't closed yet.

381
00:26:00.974 --> 00:26:03.214
So, if you can help him out a bit...

382
00:26:03.214 --> 00:26:04.815
Help him with what?

383
00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:08.585
Dad's attorney and that stupid prosecutor already ended the game.

384
00:26:09.224 --> 00:26:10.924
Why are you calling him stupid?

385
00:26:10.924 --> 00:26:12.555
All prosecutors are stupid.

386
00:26:12.994 --> 00:26:15.464
A victim's statement is all they need to let the accused go.

387
00:26:15.464 --> 00:26:17.065
Then don't write it.

388
00:26:17.065 --> 00:26:18.164
Hadn't my mom written it,

389
00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:20.394
Dad would've beaten her up until she wrote it.

390
00:26:20.394 --> 00:26:22.664
Then tell the prosecutor all about the coercion and assault.

391
00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:25.934
I told you it's pointless because they're colluding to dupe us!

392
00:26:25.934 --> 00:26:28.575
Hey, how can someone stupid do such a thing?

393
00:26:28.744 --> 00:26:31.144
See? You're admitting that they're colluding.

394
00:26:31.305 --> 00:26:33.615
That's not what I meant. Goodness.

395
00:26:34.315 --> 00:26:35.785
You little... Do you want to bet?

396
00:26:36.484 --> 00:26:38.214
That prosecutor will...

397
00:26:38.214 --> 00:26:41.255
investigate your dad and put him behind bars. I'll bet...

398
00:26:43.555 --> 00:26:45.724
I'll bet... Listen up, okay?

399
00:26:46.525 --> 00:26:47.724
Stop trying too hard.

400
00:26:48.095 --> 00:26:50.825
You probably don't even have anything to bet.

401
00:26:52.835 --> 00:26:56.035
Hey! You're the one who clogged up the toilet, right?

402
00:26:56.134 --> 00:26:58.734
You sure took a huge dump.

403
00:27:00.275 --> 00:27:01.535
How childish.

404
00:27:02.174 --> 00:27:03.244
Get lost.

405
00:27:03.644 --> 00:27:05.144
Gosh, that little...

406
00:27:05.144 --> 00:27:06.845
You're going to poop again, aren't you?

407
00:27:07.115 --> 00:27:08.585
It's yours!

408
00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:09.714
No, it's yours!

409
00:27:09.714 --> 00:27:11.615
- I know that it's yours! - Raising an only child...

410
00:27:11.615 --> 00:27:12.755
is so challenging at times.

411
00:27:12.755 --> 00:27:16.055
I always tell myself that it must be better than having two of her.

412
00:27:16.055 --> 00:27:17.184
Don't lie to my face!

413
00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:20.894
- Hey! - She takes after her dad, not me.

414
00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:25.125
How much is it?

415
00:27:25.295 --> 00:27:27.194
- It comes to 16 dollars. - Okay.

416
00:27:28.134 --> 00:27:29.134
Here you go.

417
00:27:42.684 --> 00:27:44.045
What's going on?

418
00:27:44.115 --> 00:27:46.355
Did you foresee again in your dream that I'd be here?

419
00:27:46.355 --> 00:27:48.015
No, I've been waiting for you.

420
00:27:50.724 --> 00:27:51.825
What happened to your forehead?

421
00:27:53.855 --> 00:27:55.095
And your finger too.

422
00:27:56.924 --> 00:27:58.694
I hurt myself a little while making breakfast earlier.

423
00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:07.775
Where's she going now?

424
00:28:09.097 --> 00:28:11.997
(Episode 6 will air shortly.)
