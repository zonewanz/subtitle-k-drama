(and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:22.482
(Car insurance)

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:23.752
(Repair cost, 320 dollars, medical fee, 110 dollars)

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:25.052
(Repair cost, 244 dollars, medical fee, 132 dollars)

6
00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:26.173
Hey.

7
00:00:26.173 --> 00:00:28.184
If you were going to go, you should've gone.

8
00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:30.484
Why did you suddenly stop?

9
00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.213
(Medical insurance, medical fee, 254 dollars)

10
00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.524
Sir, sir. Are you all right?

11
00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:44.393
In 1, 2, 3. Charge.

12
00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:48.764
In 2017, the percentage of...

13
00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:51.973
insurance purchase rate in Korea is 95 percent.

14
00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:54.444
There is only five percent chance you'll meet...

15
00:00:54.444 --> 00:00:56.243
someone who has zero insurance plan.

16
00:00:57.514 --> 00:00:58.874
Are they not worried...

17
00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:00.984
or do they have no life to prepare for?

18
00:01:04.454 --> 00:01:06.314
Thanks to 95 percent of people...

19
00:01:06.314 --> 00:01:09.223
who pay an average of 4,000 dollars per year,

20
00:01:09.223 --> 00:01:11.023
the insurance companies...

21
00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:13.354
get to deal with unthinkable load of money.

22
00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:16.594
4.5 million dollars of insurance fraud...

23
00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:18.064
didn't get caught last year.

24
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.294
Claims examiners still don't have...

25
00:01:20.294 --> 00:01:22.333
the rights to investigate and arrest.

26
00:01:22.663 --> 00:01:24.033
So that's why...

27
00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:26.234
there are all kinds of insurance scammers.

28
00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:29.544
And there are even trends...

29
00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:31.173
in insurance fraud.

30
00:01:36.544 --> 00:01:37.814
The current fad is...

31
00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:39.654
collusion.

32
00:01:41.654 --> 00:01:43.723
He's here.

33
00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:49.794
(Episode 1)

34
00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:53.964
Player Jang is going in.

35
00:02:00.104 --> 00:02:01.874
Can we save all the data?

36
00:02:02.143 --> 00:02:04.143
All the charts are in there.

37
00:02:04.814 --> 00:02:06.643
I don't know if it'll boot up.

38
00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:09.214
Let's see.

39
00:02:10.144 --> 00:02:12.283
Would you like something cold to drink?

40
00:02:13.013 --> 00:02:14.853
Diet Coke, please.

41
00:02:14.953 --> 00:02:16.883
Sugar startles my muscles.

42
00:02:17.594 --> 00:02:18.853
I'll go get it.

43
00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:25.464
I'm ready.

44
00:02:26.364 --> 00:02:27.564
Estimated time?

45
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:29.864
Quad core. GPU 610.

46
00:02:29.864 --> 00:02:31.133
4GB RAM.

47
00:02:31.703 --> 00:02:33.404
It's an old model.

48
00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.314
If my paw makes a mistake, about 10 minutes?

49
00:02:37.314 --> 00:02:38.874
Your paw? A mistake?

50
00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:41.084
Do you want to be beat up?

51
00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:42.184
You'll beat me again?

52
00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:49.084
Exit in 10 minutes. Twice if possible.

53
00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:50.323
If not, three times?

54
00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:56.124
Let's see.

55
00:02:56.693 --> 00:02:58.394
It's a first degree sprain.

56
00:02:58.894 --> 00:03:00.263
Would you get surgery?

57
00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.464
I don't want a scar.

58
00:03:02.464 --> 00:03:06.103
Then it'll only be a maximum of three weeks.

59
00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:07.844
With surgery?

60
00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:10.174
Up to two months is possible.

61
00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:14.483
With the surgery treaty,

62
00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:17.814
you'll take more than 10,000 dollars.

63
00:03:17.814 --> 00:03:19.413
If I stay in the hospital for two months,

64
00:03:19.413 --> 00:03:21.124
I'll be out of shape.

65
00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:23.323
Is there a gym?

66
00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:26.524
Well, security is critical here.

67
00:03:26.924 --> 00:03:28.964
So we don't show it to just anyone.

68
00:03:32.434 --> 00:03:34.633
But I can't stay just anywhere.

69
00:03:36.203 --> 00:03:37.834
I guess it won't work then.

70
00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:43.073
Since you came here on a referral,

71
00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:44.943
I'll make an exception.

72
00:03:50.614 --> 00:03:51.714
Goodness.

73
00:03:56.723 --> 00:03:58.124
You're here to make money.

74
00:03:58.124 --> 00:03:59.793
You can't get out of shape.

75
00:04:03.894 --> 00:04:05.834
He runs so well.

76
00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:09.834
That man got a million dollars for angina.

77
00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:11.473
A million for angina?

78
00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:13.374
But he runs so well.

79
00:04:13.374 --> 00:04:16.103
He doesn't move an inch when he's in his room.

80
00:04:16.503 --> 00:04:17.974
He runs like that...

81
00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:20.044
only on the day before he gets discharged.

82
00:04:20.883 --> 00:04:23.684
He says he's checking his fitness.

83
00:04:23.684 --> 00:04:25.653
That patient is amazing.

84
00:04:35.924 --> 00:04:37.593
Sun, tree creeper, robin.

85
00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:39.864
He's here with a few police officers.

86
00:04:45.174 --> 00:04:47.003
What's that? Let's get out.

87
00:04:47.003 --> 00:04:49.374
Hurry up. Let's leave.

88
00:04:49.374 --> 00:04:50.513
Let's go.

89
00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:58.013
(Saving)

90
00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:03.424
Hello, Director.

91
00:05:03.424 --> 00:05:05.924
It's Manager Park Moo Shin of Taeyang Insurance's...

92
00:05:05.924 --> 00:05:07.393
Claims Examination Team.

93
00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:09.963
Do I need to call the police again?

94
00:05:10.494 --> 00:05:12.294
I knew you'd do that, so...

95
00:05:12.763 --> 00:05:14.304
- Sergeant Kim? - Yes.

96
00:05:15.203 --> 00:05:16.734
It's a search warrant for insurance fraud...

97
00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:18.833
according to Insurance Fraud Law Article eight.

98
00:05:18.974 --> 00:05:20.874
We'll start the search and seizure.

99
00:05:20.874 --> 00:05:22.503
Goodness.

100
00:05:25.614 --> 00:05:28.513
We've known each other for years.

101
00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:30.453
The police brought a warrant.

102
00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:33.453
Player Jang, proceed upstairs.

103
00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:39.624
- Did you save it? - Of course.

104
00:05:39.624 --> 00:05:41.193
Take the hardware out.

105
00:05:41.664 --> 00:05:42.963
Excuse me.

106
00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:54.073
Player Jang, where are you?

107
00:05:54.073 --> 00:05:55.474
I'm on the rooftop.

108
00:06:16.823 --> 00:06:17.994
Get ready.

109
00:06:27.503 --> 00:06:28.843
Nice.

110
00:06:29.273 --> 00:06:30.974
Let's keep going.

111
00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:41.724
Good work.

112
00:06:44.193 --> 00:06:46.354
Hey! You!

113
00:06:49.093 --> 00:06:50.693
Tree creepers got our tail.

114
00:07:04.374 --> 00:07:05.643
Turn right.

115
00:07:09.314 --> 00:07:11.354
Cheetah is coming here, right?

116
00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:12.883
Pardon?

117
00:07:13.354 --> 00:07:15.083
I'm claustrophobic.

118
00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:16.453
- Be quiet. - Okay.

119
00:07:20.253 --> 00:07:22.693
Those lawbreaking punks.

120
00:07:22.693 --> 00:07:24.963
I'll get you all today.

121
00:07:25.093 --> 00:07:26.463
Step on it!

122
00:07:35.273 --> 00:07:37.073
Well...

123
00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:46.784
We'll get caught!

124
00:07:46.784 --> 00:07:47.984
Who says?

125
00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:51.393
3, 2, 1, 0.

126
00:08:07.674 --> 00:08:09.674
I got you, punk.

127
00:08:09.804 --> 00:08:11.174
Hold on tight.

128
00:08:11.174 --> 00:08:12.314
They're getting away.

129
00:08:12.744 --> 00:08:13.883
Darn it.

130
00:08:24.323 --> 00:08:25.523
You're the best.

131
00:08:30.224 --> 00:08:31.693
Sorry, we're late.

132
00:08:33.164 --> 00:08:35.363
Good work.

133
00:08:35.863 --> 00:08:37.073
Where's the bait?

134
00:08:41.573 --> 00:08:42.603
Ta-da.

135
00:08:42.603 --> 00:08:44.843
Gosh, you're so dirty.

136
00:08:46.914 --> 00:08:48.384
All right.

137
00:08:48.814 --> 00:08:51.654
Let's catch him.

138
00:08:54.823 --> 00:08:56.993
Sir, you have a keen eye.

139
00:08:56.993 --> 00:08:59.154
It's hard to find a property like this.

140
00:08:59.524 --> 00:09:02.064
Ma'am, you picked the right one.

141
00:09:02.064 --> 00:09:05.794
Gosh, I finally get to meet you.

142
00:09:07.004 --> 00:09:08.363
(Choi Kang Woo, Mad Dog)

143
00:09:08.363 --> 00:09:10.603
I'm Choi Kang Woo from Mad Dog.

144
00:09:13.973 --> 00:09:16.443
Mad... Mad Dog?

145
00:09:16.443 --> 00:09:19.044
It's called Mad Dog Cooperative.

146
00:09:19.274 --> 00:09:20.314
Do you know me?

147
00:09:20.314 --> 00:09:21.443
Of course.

148
00:09:21.443 --> 00:09:22.884
You have seven different...

149
00:09:22.884 --> 00:09:24.414
life insurances, right?

150
00:09:24.414 --> 00:09:26.583
How do you know that?

151
00:09:27.684 --> 00:09:29.784
How dare you...

152
00:09:29.784 --> 00:09:32.054
pry into personal information?

153
00:09:32.054 --> 00:09:33.863
Personal information.

154
00:09:33.863 --> 00:09:35.664
That's very important.

155
00:09:40.733 --> 00:09:43.674
Lee Han Dong, you received a million dollars of...

156
00:09:43.674 --> 00:09:46.904
insurance money for angina for the past three years.

157
00:09:47.243 --> 00:09:48.943
It says you can't breathe...

158
00:09:48.943 --> 00:09:50.613
if you walk for more than five minutes.

159
00:09:50.814 --> 00:09:53.073
Honey, can't you breathe?

160
00:09:53.073 --> 00:09:55.914
Relax.

161
00:09:55.914 --> 00:09:58.184
Honey.

162
00:09:58.184 --> 00:09:59.414
Which one is the truth?

163
00:10:00.353 --> 00:10:01.483
Can you run...

164
00:10:02.353 --> 00:10:03.384
or not?

165
00:10:03.384 --> 00:10:04.623
He runs like that...

166
00:10:04.623 --> 00:10:06.654
only on the day before he gets discharged.

167
00:10:06.794 --> 00:10:09.693
He says he's checking his fitness.

168
00:10:10.534 --> 00:10:12.963
That's...

169
00:10:17.373 --> 00:10:20.274
Mad Dog is a cure for a man like you,

170
00:10:20.274 --> 00:10:22.743
insurance scammer Lee Han Dong.

171
00:10:25.873 --> 00:10:28.384
What are you talking about?

172
00:10:33.254 --> 00:10:34.524
Hey, punk.

(Episode 1, Collusion)

175
00:10:48.934 --> 00:10:50.674
22 doctors and patients were arrested...

176
00:10:50.674 --> 00:10:54.373
for illegally cooperating on an insurance fraud.

177
00:10:54.473 --> 00:10:56.073
Financial Supervisory System...

178
00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:57.144
and the police worked together in this.

179
00:10:57.144 --> 00:10:59.814
They worked together to arrest the culprits?

180
00:11:01.414 --> 00:11:04.314
I'm sorry, but we caught them.

181
00:11:04.754 --> 00:11:06.554
Life Insurance Association has deposited a reward...

182
00:11:06.554 --> 00:11:09.083
of 10,000 dollars in each of our bank accounts.

183
00:11:09.083 --> 00:11:10.154
Yes!

184
00:11:10.154 --> 00:11:12.424
Let's drink and wrap this up. Cheers.

185
00:11:12.424 --> 00:11:13.493
Okay.

186
00:11:29.203 --> 00:11:30.304
Kang Woo, you punk.

187
00:11:32.613 --> 00:11:35.113
Will you keep ruining Claims Examiner's image?

188
00:11:35.884 --> 00:11:37.684
It's you who ruined its image.

189
00:11:37.684 --> 00:11:39.853
You lured Sergeant Kim to issue a search warrant.

190
00:11:39.853 --> 00:11:41.884
But he came out empty-handed.

191
00:11:41.884 --> 00:11:44.993
He thanked us for cleaning up your mess.

192
00:11:44.993 --> 00:11:46.254
You drink soju bomb, right?

193
00:11:46.254 --> 00:11:49.193
Soon Jung, go ahead and make one for him.

194
00:11:49.193 --> 00:11:50.193
Yes, sir.

195
00:11:51.434 --> 00:11:54.463
You jerk. Is this what you do after resigning?

196
00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:57.004
You break the laws saying you're some kind of...

197
00:11:57.004 --> 00:11:58.674
private investigation group.

198
00:11:58.674 --> 00:12:00.274
You trespass places and record illegally.

199
00:12:00.274 --> 00:12:01.373
Do you have proof?

200
00:12:05.243 --> 00:12:08.443
You drove the jeep to the hospital garage, right?

201
00:12:08.443 --> 00:12:10.514
Not every jeep is Ha Ri's.

202
00:12:10.953 --> 00:12:12.154
It was me, Mr. Choi.

203
00:12:12.154 --> 00:12:14.254
I had the afternoon off and went to the hospital.

204
00:12:14.823 --> 00:12:16.623
Right, you sprained your ankle.

205
00:12:16.623 --> 00:12:17.924
Is it okay now?

206
00:12:17.924 --> 00:12:19.294
I met such a great doctor.

207
00:12:21.863 --> 00:12:24.233
You guys will be done for soon enough.

208
00:12:24.233 --> 00:12:26.034
We're restoring the hospital computer system.

209
00:12:26.034 --> 00:12:27.463
We'll find the proof...

210
00:12:27.463 --> 00:12:28.863
that you illegally copied the hospital files.

211
00:12:28.863 --> 00:12:30.934
Don't be like an amateur.

212
00:12:30.934 --> 00:12:34.073
That's not the proof you need to arrest us.

213
00:12:34.073 --> 00:12:35.274
There's no other private investigation team...

214
00:12:35.274 --> 00:12:36.544
who did such a thing other than you.

215
00:12:36.544 --> 00:12:38.613
Bring me the evidence, not your suspicion.

216
00:12:38.613 --> 00:12:40.983
All right. Let's say it wasn't your doing.

217
00:12:40.983 --> 00:12:41.983
Where did you get the files?

218
00:12:41.983 --> 00:12:44.154
We keep our informant's identity as secret.

219
00:12:44.154 --> 00:12:45.154
Informant, my foot.

220
00:12:45.154 --> 00:12:48.853
The hospital was in this together.

221
00:12:48.853 --> 00:12:51.993
They must've hidden the files deep inside.

222
00:12:51.993 --> 00:12:54.424
Look. None of us are capable of finding that.

223
00:12:54.424 --> 00:12:55.993
He can't do that. She can't do that.

224
00:12:55.993 --> 00:12:57.634
- Soon Jung, you. - What?

225
00:12:59.363 --> 00:13:02.963
He's terrible at using machines.

226
00:13:02.963 --> 00:13:06.134
He doesn't even use a smartphone.

227
00:13:08.243 --> 00:13:10.814
You. You're in charge of machines, right?

228
00:13:10.814 --> 00:13:13.983
He's allergic to sunlight. He never works on spot.

229
00:13:13.983 --> 00:13:15.414
Look at you.

230
00:13:15.414 --> 00:13:16.743
This is just as I expected.

231
00:13:16.743 --> 00:13:17.884
You would've made me disappointed otherwise.

232

I'll make sure to arrest each one of you myself...

236
00:13:29.664 --> 00:13:31.564

Will you keep living all messed up?

241
00:13:42.674 --> 00:13:45.113
Aren't you ashamed of your late wife and son?

242
00:13:54.623 --> 00:13:55.623

Yes, sir.

Goodness.

340
00:22:20.994 --> 00:22:23.024
If she wakes up, she'll end up with aftereffects.

341
00:22:23.024 --> 00:22:24.264
(Facial contusion, concussion, in coma)

342
00:22:24.264 --> 00:22:25.393
(Injury due to a building collapse)

343
00:22:25.393 --> 00:22:27.633
How can that landlord stay silent when she is...

344
00:22:27.633 --> 00:22:28.933
this badly hurt? That jerk.

345
00:22:28.933 --> 00:22:30.004
(Lumbar CT Scan)

346
00:22:30.004 --> 00:22:32.234
And he has the nerve to claim 2.3 million dollars.

347
00:22:45.883 --> 00:22:49.923
Goodness, he must've been through quite a lot.

348
00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:52.794
It's all because of this.

349
00:22:52.853 --> 00:22:55.093
It's all because I dropped this robot.

350
00:22:55.923 --> 00:22:59.093
Mommy.

351
00:23:00.064 --> 00:23:01.504
That's not true.

352
00:23:01.663 --> 00:23:04.373
He could be here now because you saved him.

353
00:23:04.433 --> 00:23:06.474
You did well. You did a great job.

354
00:23:06.534 --> 00:23:10.544
But my mommy is badly hurt.

355
00:23:11.014 --> 00:23:14.413
Do you want me to find the guy who hurt her?

356
00:23:15.484 --> 00:23:17.014
Do you want me to punish him for you?

357
00:23:17.014 --> 00:23:19.353
I want to be a part. Let me punish him too.

358
00:23:19.353 --> 00:23:20.683
No way.

359
00:23:20.923 --> 00:23:23.484
Seon Ho, you have to protect your dad.

360
00:23:23.923 --> 00:23:25.893
I'll go with him. Okay?

361
00:23:28.623 --> 00:23:30.564
Make sure you give him a good punishment.

362
00:23:34.504 --> 00:23:35.633
I will.

363
00:23:36.133 --> 00:23:37.403
I'll make sure I do that.

364
00:23:37.704 --> 00:23:38.774
("Happy House")

365
00:23:38.774 --> 00:23:40.234
- Thank you. - No, I thank you.

366
00:23:41.004 --> 00:23:42.304
- Hello. - Hello.

367
00:23:42.304 --> 00:23:43.304
Hello.

368
00:23:44.944 --> 00:23:47.984
The landlord, Architect Ahn Chi Hoon.

369
00:23:47.984 --> 00:23:49.343
He's been appearing on a TV Show at no charge,

370
00:23:49.343 --> 00:23:51.714
which builds houses for low-income households.

371
00:23:51.883 --> 00:23:54.083
He rose in popularity as a handsome architect.

372
00:24:00.224 --> 00:24:01.923
That's what he may seem like on the outside.

373
00:24:02.593 --> 00:24:04.363
Do you remember that rumor about...

374
00:24:04.363 --> 00:24:06.933
the son of a high official who's a serious druggie?

375
00:24:07.403 --> 00:24:10.603
Rumors say Mr. Ahn is running errands for him.

376
00:24:11.133 --> 00:24:14.843
Gosh, he's a man of many different colors.

377
00:24:15.744 --> 00:24:17.714
Where is he headed?

378
00:24:17.843 --> 00:24:20.784
He's going near a place where he was two days ago.

379
00:24:22.143 --> 00:24:25.814
It looks like he's on his way to see a barmaid.

380
00:24:33.893 --> 00:24:34.923
Hey.

381
00:24:37.663 --> 00:24:39.564
- Hello. - Is she here?

382
00:24:39.564 --> 00:24:41.103
Yes, she's been waiting for you.

383
00:24:41.103 --> 00:24:42.534
You'll have another great day.

384
00:24:53.113 --> 00:24:54.113
Hey, it's been a while.

385
00:24:54.113 --> 00:24:55.143
You got prettier.

386
00:25:08.194 --> 00:25:10.363
He didn't say anything like that.

387
00:25:10.633 --> 00:25:12.663
He isn't worried about how his building collapsed?

388
00:25:12.663 --> 00:25:15.534
Yes, from what she said, he was completely sure...

389
00:25:15.534 --> 00:25:17.573
he has no responsibilities in this incident.

390
00:25:18.034 --> 00:25:20.804
Why is that? I'm very curious.

391
00:25:29.314 --> 00:25:32.314
Guys, let's go and meet the guy.

392
00:25:39.524 --> 00:25:41.064
(Architect Ahn Chi Hoon)

393
00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:45.494
You look tired.

394
00:25:45.593 --> 00:25:47.504
Someone released an article a few days ago.

395
00:25:48.464 --> 00:25:50.633
Trashy journalists claim I did poor construction...

396
00:25:50.933 --> 00:25:52.833
without looking into the facts.

397
00:25:53.944 --> 00:25:56.744
Mad Dog? Which company are you affiliated with?

398
00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:02.683
I work for the same person as this guy.

399
00:26:03.484 --> 00:26:04.853
Lee Seon Ho.

400
00:26:04.853 --> 00:26:05.883
Who's Lee Seon Ho?

401
00:26:05.883 --> 00:26:07.284
Lee Seon Ho, a six-year-old.

402
00:26:07.284 --> 00:26:09.853
The dakgalbi place's son on the first floor.

403
00:26:10.524 --> 00:26:11.653
Goodness.

404
00:26:12.393 --> 00:26:13.663
What do you think you're doing?

405
00:26:13.663 --> 00:26:14.863
What do you think?

406
00:26:15.163 --> 00:26:17.333
A tenant in your building requested that...

407
00:26:17.333 --> 00:26:18.663
an investigation be done about the accident.

408
00:26:18.663 --> 00:26:20.333
Why would a tenant need to know that?

409
00:26:20.603 --> 00:26:22.464
Do they think they'll get some money?

410
00:26:23.064 --> 00:26:25.534
This is why Korea never makes progress.

411
00:26:25.903 --> 00:26:27.274
People are like beggars.

412
00:26:27.373 --> 00:26:29.744
They should try to make a living for themselves.

413
00:26:29.974 --> 00:26:32.244
When they see anyone they can take advantage of,

414
00:26:32.244 --> 00:26:34.643
they will bite onto them and never go.

415
00:26:36.143 --> 00:26:37.454
You're right.

416
00:26:37.984 --> 00:26:39.784
A mad dog is...

417
00:26:39.784 --> 00:26:41.724
onto you, Mr. Ahn.

418
00:26:41.724 --> 00:26:42.784
A dog?

419
00:26:47.994 --> 00:26:50.123
What do you need? Tell me what you want.

420
00:26:50.123 --> 00:26:51.464
We need anything and everything.

421
00:26:51.464 --> 00:26:53.194
I'll give you everything.

422
00:26:53.194 --> 00:26:54.403
Take them all.

423
00:26:55.034 --> 00:26:57.474
The building was not poorly constructed.

424
00:26:57.474 --> 00:27:00.133
In that case, I will conduct...

425
00:27:00.133 --> 00:27:03.403
a thorough and meticulous investigation very slowly.

426
00:27:13.724 --> 00:27:14.923
Who do you think you are?

427
00:27:15.653 --> 00:27:18.254
Your wink is the best way to make women go away.

428
00:27:18.254 --> 00:27:19.554
Shut your mouth.

429
00:27:24.034 --> 00:27:25.163
Mission cleared.

430
00:27:25.734 --> 00:27:27.464
Seven minutes until we exit.

431
00:27:27.464 --> 00:27:30.833
Something modern, European, yet classical.

432
00:27:31.034 --> 00:27:33.373
But if it's too classical, it'll be too tacky.

433
00:27:34.504 --> 00:27:37.843
Do you have anything modern yet classical?

434
00:27:39.843 --> 00:27:41.444
We do have something like that.

435
00:27:41.444 --> 00:27:42.683
Give me a moment.

436
00:27:45.454 --> 00:27:46.613
What about the ceiling?

437
00:28:12.514 --> 00:28:14.613
- Are you all right? - Yes.

438
00:28:20.353 --> 00:28:22.083
I was afraid of a cockroach on the floor.

439
00:28:22.083 --> 00:28:23.353
A cockroach?

440
00:28:24.054 --> 00:28:25.994
Where is it? Where?

441
00:28:26.794 --> 00:28:30.123
Catch it, okay? Make sure you catch it.

442
00:28:30.534 --> 00:28:32.064
My gosh.

443
00:28:33.133 --> 00:28:34.964
- What's with him? - I thought you'd...

444
00:28:34.964 --> 00:28:38.103
hit it off with him, but it's more work for you.

445
00:28:38.103 --> 00:28:40.103
- She expected something. - Stop joking around.

446
00:28:40.103 --> 00:28:42.244
I'll punch your faces. Mission cleared.

447
00:28:44.744 --> 00:28:46.314
Three minutes until we exit.

448
00:28:56.423 --> 00:28:57.694
Who are you?

449
00:28:58.294 --> 00:29:00.093
I'm from the investigative agency.

450
00:29:00.294 --> 00:29:02.863
Are you here for documents of the collapsed building?

451
00:29:02.863 --> 00:29:04.093
Give me a moment.

452
00:29:08.433 --> 00:29:10.234
(Ahn Construction, security level high)

453
00:29:18.944 --> 00:29:20.514
I've been preventing dementia.

454
00:29:21.444 --> 00:29:22.714
If you do this,

455
00:29:22.714 --> 00:29:24.413
it'll increase blood flow in your brain.

456
00:29:24.413 --> 00:29:25.913
Is that so?

457
00:29:26.083 --> 00:29:27.254
Are you in your 40s?

458
00:29:27.683 --> 00:29:29.583
Some think I'm still in my late 30s.

459
00:29:29.583 --> 00:29:31.954
Your fingertips are numb, and you're forgetful.

460
00:29:31.954 --> 00:29:34.224
It's not that bad yet.

461
00:29:34.224 --> 00:29:36.524
- What about you? - I'm still young.

462
00:29:38.534 --> 00:29:39.663
Try doing this.

463
00:29:43.403 --> 00:29:44.403
Like this?

464
00:29:44.403 --> 00:29:46.704
Now, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.

465
00:29:46.704 --> 00:29:48.143
And 1, 2, 1, 2.

466
00:29:48.143 --> 00:29:49.343
Great.

467
00:29:50.474 --> 00:29:51.974
(Kim Min Joon)

468
00:29:58.153 --> 00:30:00.784
The building pictures match the blueprint.

469
00:30:00.784 --> 00:30:02.153
What about Ahn's dash cam?

470
00:30:02.153 --> 00:30:04.294
He formatted it. It's spotless.

471
00:30:04.294 --> 00:30:06.224
Gosh, he's very quick.

472
00:30:07.264 --> 00:30:08.524
What about a footage of the accident?

473
00:30:09.093 --> 00:30:10.833
This is a video from the building's inside.

474
00:30:10.833 --> 00:30:12.833
I think we can get a video taken from the outside...

475
00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:14.433
to see how the building collapsed...

476
00:30:16.564 --> 00:30:18.173
from the dash cam of the car...

477
00:30:18.173 --> 00:30:20.034
parked illegally across the street.

478
00:30:20.643 --> 00:30:22.774
But I'll have to look up the license plate number.

479
00:30:23.143 --> 00:30:24.343
- Is that so? - Yes.

480
00:30:25.244 --> 00:30:27.014
In that case...

481
00:30:27.244 --> 00:30:28.244
(Jo Han Wu)

482
00:30:30.784 --> 00:30:32.214
Your call cannot be connected.

483
00:30:32.214 --> 00:30:33.413
- Leave a message... - Ha Ri.

484
00:30:33.653 --> 00:30:35.123
I'll be back.

485
00:30:36.383 --> 00:30:37.794
That's disgusting.

486
00:30:37.794 --> 00:30:40.323
The women take turns and spit in Ahn's coffee.

487
00:30:49.234 --> 00:30:51.173
Detective Jo, where are you going?

488
00:30:53.034 --> 00:30:55.544
Hey. This isn't a detective agency.

489
00:30:55.544 --> 00:30:56.643
Get out of here while I'm being nice.

490
00:30:57.044 --> 00:30:58.814
People are watching. Will you be okay?

491
00:30:58.814 --> 00:31:00.683
Why wouldn't I be okay?

492
00:31:01.913 --> 00:31:03.284
Hey.

493
00:31:03.284 --> 00:31:04.814
Hey. No.

494
00:31:04.814 --> 00:31:06.314
Put it back on.

495
00:31:06.314 --> 00:31:08.353
Hey, I've known you for a while now.

496
00:31:08.353 --> 00:31:09.683
I won't get tricked. Leave!

497
00:31:09.683 --> 00:31:12.224
Honey, I know you're a cop,

498
00:31:12.224 --> 00:31:15.363
but you can't leave without paying your tab.

499
00:31:15.363 --> 00:31:16.863
Hey, are you high?

500
00:31:16.863 --> 00:31:19.663
How can you exploit a poor girl like me?

501
00:31:19.663 --> 00:31:20.903
Hey, are you crazy?

502
00:31:20.903 --> 00:31:23.534
Go! Leave!

503
00:31:24.004 --> 00:31:25.603
Which way is to the chief's office?

504
00:31:26.433 --> 00:31:27.504
Hey.

505
00:31:29.073 --> 00:31:30.514
What do you want? Tell me.

506
00:31:31.744 --> 00:31:33.244
The car owner's name and his number.

507
00:31:33.744 --> 00:31:36.083
How does Kang Woo call himself my friend?

508
00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:37.984
No, not this way.

509
00:31:39.514 --> 00:31:40.524
Checkmate.

510
00:31:40.623 --> 00:31:44.194
Gosh, why can't you go easy on me?

511
00:31:46.823 --> 00:31:48.363
Why are you here...

512
00:31:48.494 --> 00:31:50.863
playing chess with an old man?

513
00:31:52.393 --> 00:31:53.964
A building collapsed.

514
00:31:53.964 --> 00:31:55.564
Architect Ahn Chi Hoon?

515
00:31:55.804 --> 00:31:57.073
He's famous.

516
00:31:57.073 --> 00:31:58.133
Is he a crook?

517
00:31:59.034 --> 00:32:01.103
Well, I'll look into him.

518
00:32:01.103 --> 00:32:03.814
Then you'll have to look into the building.

519
00:32:10.853 --> 00:32:12.214
Hyun Jung Hwa, the best Jung Hwa?

520
00:32:12.214 --> 00:32:14.083
He's a member of my ping pong club.

521
00:32:14.254 --> 00:32:16.153
He was a manager of an architecture institute.

522
00:32:16.323 --> 00:32:18.294
I hear he's quite an important figure.

523
00:32:18.294 --> 00:32:20.923
I'm sorry I keep asking you a favor.

524
00:32:20.923 --> 00:32:24.234
Thanks for entertaining an old retired man.

525
00:32:24.363 --> 00:32:25.994
Tell him Sharp Smash sent you.

526
00:32:25.994 --> 00:32:27.333
"Sharp Smash"?

527
00:32:27.333 --> 00:32:28.804
Isn't it a cool nickname?

528
00:32:28.804 --> 00:32:29.903
Smash.

529
00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:43.984
Nice.

530
00:32:44.284 --> 00:32:45.484
Great job.

531
00:32:47.923 --> 00:32:49.284
Hello.

532
00:32:49.284 --> 00:32:52.653
I'm Kim Min Joon from Ahn Construction.

533
00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:07.173
You don't want it to be a shoddy construction...

534
00:33:07.173 --> 00:33:08.944
and you do, right?

535
00:33:08.944 --> 00:33:10.274
I want the truth.

536
00:33:10.274 --> 00:33:11.974
I don't want it to be a shoddy construction.

537
00:33:13.913 --> 00:33:16.814
- You don't? - If it is, then...

538
00:33:16.814 --> 00:33:18.954
the company will close, and I'll lose a job.

539
00:33:19.613 --> 00:33:21.024
The plan looks fine.

540
00:33:21.123 --> 00:33:22.554
It should've been okay for 100 years.

541
00:33:22.554 --> 00:33:23.554
Right?

542
00:33:23.653 --> 00:33:26.694
Then the construction must have been shoddy.

543
00:33:26.694 --> 00:33:27.823
It must've been.

544
00:33:27.823 --> 00:33:30.064
Do you have a video of it collapsing?

545
00:33:30.064 --> 00:33:31.994
That'll tell us why it collapsed.

546
00:33:31.994 --> 00:33:33.093
We're looking for it.

547
00:33:33.093 --> 00:33:34.504
But construction-wise,

548
00:33:34.933 --> 00:33:36.633
there was nothing wrong on paper.

549
00:33:36.633 --> 00:33:38.704
Documents can be fabricated.

550
00:33:38.704 --> 00:33:40.673
The builders write up the paper.

551
00:33:40.744 --> 00:33:42.103
It's not my boss's fault.

552
00:33:42.103 --> 00:33:44.044
If he was in on it, then it's his fault.

553
00:33:44.044 --> 00:33:45.373
Come on, you mean my boss?

554
00:33:45.373 --> 00:33:46.774
You have no proof he didn't do it.

555
00:33:46.774 --> 00:33:48.583
Then do you have proof that he did it?

556
00:33:57.494 --> 00:33:58.494
Yes?

557
00:33:58.593 --> 00:34:00.794
We need a video of the building collapsing...

558
00:34:00.794 --> 00:34:02.494
to prove that the builder is at fault.

559
00:34:02.494 --> 00:34:03.764
Did you get the video?

560
00:34:03.764 --> 00:34:06.564
There are no surveillance videos recorded.

561
00:34:06.564 --> 00:34:08.964
I'm trying to get a hold of a dash cam.

562
00:34:08.964 --> 00:34:10.933
Let's check Ahn Chi Hoon's construction site first.

563
00:34:10.933 --> 00:34:12.203
All right.

564
00:34:15.603 --> 00:34:18.614
I'll sweep every little detail.

565
00:34:18.774 --> 00:34:19.973
It's show time.

566
00:34:27.254 --> 00:34:28.824
Okay.

567
00:34:29.583 --> 00:34:30.723
All right.

568
00:34:31.053 --> 00:34:33.864
He's been building a luxury villa like this.

569
00:34:36.663 --> 00:34:38.134
Proof for shoddy construction.

570
00:34:38.594 --> 00:34:39.933
Sent.

571
00:34:43.703 --> 00:34:45.333
Look at these.

572
00:34:49.844 --> 00:34:51.314
Okay.

573
00:34:51.314 --> 00:34:53.444
There's a light on the left.

574
00:35:14.364 --> 00:35:16.234
Get a few more of brighter ones.

575
00:35:16.333 --> 00:35:18.274
I made it bright. Use the computer.

576
00:35:18.274 --> 00:35:19.603
It's too dark.

577
00:35:19.774 --> 00:35:20.774
Okay, sir.

578
00:35:31.013 --> 00:35:33.254
What was that? Who's there?

579
00:35:34.324 --> 00:35:35.953
What's going on?

580
00:35:37.824 --> 00:35:39.794
I shouldn't get tangled up in a crime scene.

581
00:35:39.794 --> 00:35:41.263
Cheetah, exit.

582
00:35:41.263 --> 00:35:43.294
- Okay. - What are you doing?

583
00:35:44.033 --> 00:35:45.294
Stop there.

584
00:35:45.533 --> 00:35:47.564
- Don't come close. - Hey.

585
00:35:49.203 --> 00:35:50.373
Help me!

586
00:35:51.634 --> 00:35:53.234
Gosh.

587
00:35:53.603 --> 00:35:54.803
No.

588
00:35:54.803 --> 00:35:56.603
Ex-con Park Soon Jung.

589
00:35:56.743 --> 00:35:58.373
If you're caught, you'll get aggravated punishment.

590
00:35:59.174 --> 00:36:00.944
Yes, I'm an ex-con.

591
00:36:00.944 --> 00:36:02.643
Aggravated punishment.

592
00:36:02.643 --> 00:36:04.853
No.

593
00:36:04.853 --> 00:36:06.683
Aggravated punishment.

594
00:36:08.384 --> 00:36:11.794
Hey. What are you doing?

595
00:36:15.393 --> 00:36:16.393
Boss.

596
00:36:17.033 --> 00:36:19.493
I really hate myself for doing this.

597
00:36:20.033 --> 00:36:21.064
I'm sorry.

598
00:36:22.433 --> 00:36:24.203
Go easy on them.

599
00:36:24.203 --> 00:36:26.004
Don't worry.

600
00:36:27.373 --> 00:36:28.703
Who is that?

601
00:36:30.074 --> 00:36:31.544
Who are you?

602
00:36:31.544 --> 00:36:33.444
I'm Cheetah, you punk.

603
00:36:35.614 --> 00:36:36.884
It's show time.

604
00:36:45.424 --> 00:36:46.754
You punk.

605
00:36:58.004 --> 00:36:59.033
Gosh.

606
00:37:12.553 --> 00:37:13.783
Please.

607
00:37:17.194 --> 00:37:19.924
I told you not to move.

608
00:37:20.324 --> 00:37:22.663
You know, I'm certified.

609
00:37:22.663 --> 00:37:24.033
I'm a certified nurse.

610
00:37:24.794 --> 00:37:29.134
I can't thank you enough.

611
00:37:34.944 --> 00:37:36.074
The manager said...

612
00:37:36.473 --> 00:37:38.714
Ahn Construction repeatedly moved up...

613
00:37:38.714 --> 00:37:41.344
the construction closure dates,

614
00:37:41.714 --> 00:37:43.614
and they ignored...

615
00:37:43.614 --> 00:37:45.183
the poor quality of rebars...

616
00:37:45.183 --> 00:37:46.583
and the lack of concrete.

617
00:38:14.513 --> 00:38:16.444
0381. Isn't that the car?

618
00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:21.683
Isn't he handing over the memory card?

619
00:38:22.353 --> 00:38:23.794
Gosh, that cockroach.

620
00:38:23.794 --> 00:38:24.824
A cockroach?

621
00:38:25.694 --> 00:38:27.623
Where is it? Where?

622
00:38:28.424 --> 00:38:29.493
Catch it, okay?

623
00:38:29.493 --> 00:38:31.864
Make sure you catch it.

624
00:38:32.263 --> 00:38:33.663
Gosh.

625
00:38:33.904 --> 00:38:36.064
He knows my face, so you should go get it.

626
00:38:36.703 --> 00:38:37.873
May I punch him?

627
00:38:39.574 --> 00:38:40.574
Can I?

628
00:38:53.754 --> 00:38:54.754
Excuse me.

629
00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:57.393
Aren't you from Mad Dog?

630
00:38:57.853 --> 00:39:01.123
- Me? - He was expecting you...

631
00:39:01.123 --> 00:39:02.924
for the dash cam memory card.

632
00:39:05.594 --> 00:39:06.594
I'm...

633
00:39:06.864 --> 00:39:09.504
Kim Min Joon from Ahn Construction.

634
00:39:09.703 --> 00:39:11.074
Ahn Construction.

635
00:39:11.373 --> 00:39:12.873
Why are you here?

636
00:39:12.873 --> 00:39:15.703
For the same reason you are here.

637
00:39:16.203 --> 00:39:17.214
To collect evidence.

638
00:39:17.574 --> 00:39:19.513
Ahn Chi Hoon.

639
00:39:19.973 --> 00:39:22.913
Why did he order his employee to do this?

640
00:39:22.913 --> 00:39:24.484
I'll take that.

641
00:39:25.013 --> 00:39:26.114
For free?

642
00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:27.453
Then what?

643
00:39:32.893 --> 00:39:34.064
What's in here?

644
00:39:34.393 --> 00:39:36.824
Mr. Kim Min Joon from Ahn Construction.

645
00:39:40.634 --> 00:39:42.103
Why are you here?

646
00:39:42.703 --> 00:39:43.873
Because I'm curious.

647
00:39:44.174 --> 00:39:46.574
I'm really interested in detective agencies.

648
00:39:46.574 --> 00:39:47.904
A detective agency?

649
00:39:49.944 --> 00:39:52.013
Can a detective agency handle this case?

650
00:39:52.013 --> 00:39:53.143
Shouldn't a famous...

651
00:39:53.143 --> 00:39:55.013
If they're a neighborhood soccer club players,

652
00:39:55.013 --> 00:39:56.384
we're like Lionel Messi.

653
00:39:56.384 --> 00:39:58.013
Messi.

654
00:40:02.424 --> 00:40:03.553
Mr. Kim Min Joon.

655
00:40:04.053 --> 00:40:06.324
I asked you why you are here.

656
00:40:06.324 --> 00:40:07.424
Because I'm bored.

657
00:40:08.864 --> 00:40:11.833
An adequate stimulation is good for you.

658
00:40:12.263 --> 00:40:13.493
- Like this? - Yes.

659
00:40:13.493 --> 00:40:14.864
1, 2...

660
00:40:16.964 --> 00:40:18.103
Yes!

661
00:40:20.103 --> 00:40:21.103
(Importing data)

662
00:40:26.214 --> 00:40:27.544
It's dancing.

663
00:40:28.114 --> 00:40:31.783
Whoever built it did an amazing job.

664
00:40:33.013 --> 00:40:36.424
I knew it. The billboard fell and hit the building.

665
00:40:36.424 --> 00:40:39.424
The building shook first. That's why it fell.

666
00:40:39.453 --> 00:40:41.824
That's an opinion of a layman.

667
00:40:46.833 --> 00:40:48.564
Specialist Kim Min Joon.

668
00:40:49.103 --> 00:40:51.274
Then why did the billboard fall?

669
00:40:51.533 --> 00:40:52.603
Before talking about that,

670
00:40:52.734 --> 00:40:54.274
it's not like there was an earthquake.

671
00:40:54.274 --> 00:40:55.674
So why did the building shake?

672
00:40:55.674 --> 00:40:56.803
Mr. Choi.

673
00:40:56.803 --> 00:40:57.814
Yes?

674
00:40:57.814 --> 00:41:01.114
By any chance, have you heard of Heinrich's Law?

675
00:41:01.114 --> 00:41:02.114
No.

676
00:41:02.114 --> 00:41:03.214
It's a publicly convincing law...

677
00:41:03.214 --> 00:41:04.683
in the field of industrial accident.

678
00:41:04.683 --> 00:41:06.013
"For every accident that causes a major injury,"

679
00:41:06.013 --> 00:41:08.123
"there are 29 accidents..."

680
00:41:08.123 --> 00:41:09.984
"that cause minor injuries..."

681
00:41:09.984 --> 00:41:13.553
"and 300 accidents that cause no injuries."

682
00:41:13.553 --> 00:41:14.993
- So? - We must find out...

683
00:41:14.993 --> 00:41:16.694
29 minor accidents...

684
00:41:16.694 --> 00:41:18.634
and 300 accidents without any injuries.

685
00:41:18.634 --> 00:41:20.464
So you'll find all of them no matter...

686
00:41:20.464 --> 00:41:22.263
- how long it takes? - Yes.

687
00:41:22.263 --> 00:41:24.274
What about the injured tenant then?

688
00:41:24.433 --> 00:41:26.134
What are you going to do about it?

689
00:41:26.774 --> 00:41:28.074
Tenant?

690
00:41:28.344 --> 00:41:29.344
That little...

691
00:41:36.143 --> 00:41:37.984
Specialist Mr. Kim Min Joon?

692
00:41:39.314 --> 00:41:41.524
It costs 50 dollars per day for a patient...

693
00:41:41.754 --> 00:41:43.353
to be hospitalized in a 6-person ward.

694
00:41:44.194 --> 00:41:46.053
Isn't it cheaper than expected?

695
00:41:46.824 --> 00:41:49.393
But you know what? Including medicine,

696
00:41:49.393 --> 00:41:51.393
medical machine usage, and everything, it costs...

697
00:41:51.393 --> 00:41:53.433
thousands of dollars a month.

698
00:41:54.533 --> 00:41:57.103
Whether they die or not,

699
00:41:57.103 --> 00:41:58.373
do you insist on...

700
00:41:58.373 --> 00:42:00.203
investigating on all those for months and years?

701
00:42:01.004 --> 00:42:02.973
Have you no conscience?

702
00:42:02.973 --> 00:42:04.274
You caused the accident,

703
00:42:04.274 --> 00:42:06.174
so you need to think about saving injured people.

704
00:42:06.174 --> 00:42:07.944
Whether they die or not, you bring out...

705
00:42:07.944 --> 00:42:10.353
that petty publicly convincing law and what?

706
00:42:10.353 --> 00:42:12.614
You'll find out hundreds of what?

707
00:42:12.614 --> 00:42:14.524
Be rational.

708
00:42:14.654 --> 00:42:16.424
What's important now is why...

709
00:42:16.424 --> 00:42:19.493
the building collapsed. Isn't that right?

710
00:42:19.623 --> 00:42:21.564
So you think it's not important...

711
00:42:21.564 --> 00:42:22.763
that people got injured?

712
00:42:22.763 --> 00:42:24.134
Unless it's due to poor construction.

713
00:42:24.134 --> 00:42:25.794
- What if it is? - I bet it's not.

714
00:42:25.794 --> 00:42:26.964
You want to bet?

715
00:42:28.603 --> 00:42:29.703
Bet?

716
00:42:31.473 --> 00:42:33.203
What will you give me if I win this bet?

717
00:42:33.203 --> 00:42:34.444
What do you want?

718
00:42:37.243 --> 00:42:38.243
Mad Dog.

719
00:42:40.044 --> 00:42:41.143
What?

720
00:42:45.384 --> 00:42:46.553
Deal.

721
00:42:46.553 --> 00:42:47.953
- Mr. Choi. - Instead,

722
00:42:48.683 --> 00:42:50.053
if you lose,

723
00:42:50.283 --> 00:42:52.393
get us the evidence of...

724
00:42:52.393 --> 00:42:53.864
Ahn Construction's corruption.

725
00:42:56.424 --> 00:42:57.694
I know it isn't due to poor construction.

726
00:43:03.464 --> 00:43:05.174
- Deal. - Deal.

727
00:43:06.904 --> 00:43:10.203
Oh, right. Heinrich's Law wasn't...

728
00:43:10.473 --> 00:43:13.413
claimed by unconscientious architects.

729
00:43:14.143 --> 00:43:16.714
Herbert Heinrich was an insurance inspector...

730
00:43:17.214 --> 00:43:19.384
just like you.

731
00:43:21.053 --> 00:43:22.853
Well, then. I'll see you again.

732
00:43:24.853 --> 00:43:26.424
Why that little...

733
00:43:31.694 --> 00:43:32.964
Mr. Choi.

734
00:43:33.094 --> 00:43:35.333
What? Are you not confident?

735
00:43:36.904 --> 00:43:38.203
The guy...

736
00:43:38.433 --> 00:43:40.473
has a pretty high security level...

737
00:43:40.473 --> 00:43:41.674
of internal authorization.

738
00:43:42.203 --> 00:43:44.114
(Ahn Construction)

739
00:43:44.774 --> 00:43:46.274
Let's get to work.

740
00:43:47.283 --> 00:43:49.114
Seon Ho is waiting.

741
00:43:50.114 --> 00:43:51.814
Thank you.

742
00:43:51.814 --> 00:43:54.053
(Insurance Claim)

743
00:43:54.053 --> 00:43:56.324
This is why you shouldn't...

744
00:43:56.324 --> 00:43:58.294
judge people by their appearance.

745
00:43:58.493 --> 00:43:59.794
Ahn Chi Hoon is the perfect example.

746
00:43:59.794 --> 00:44:02.864
He's an architect, and it makes him look nice.

747
00:44:03.064 --> 00:44:04.094
But...

748
00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:08.833
he has a history in the insurance field.

749
00:44:10.103 --> 00:44:11.234
How bad is it?

750
00:44:11.634 --> 00:44:13.703
He would've been convicted for four times...

751
00:44:13.703 --> 00:44:15.944
if he got caught for all his deeds.

752
00:44:16.444 --> 00:44:17.973
Goodness.

753
00:44:18.544 --> 00:44:20.274
He was extra careful that he made...

754
00:44:20.274 --> 00:44:22.143
only one contract with each company.

755
00:44:22.444 --> 00:44:23.484
What should we do now?

756
00:44:24.583 --> 00:44:28.053
Mad Dog caught him right.

757
00:44:31.393 --> 00:44:33.864
"Fire caused by the building collapse".

758
00:44:34.993 --> 00:44:36.663
His scale grew from tens of thousands of dollars...

759
00:44:36.663 --> 00:44:38.564
to 2.3 million dollars all of a sudden.

760
00:44:41.033 --> 00:44:43.234
- Noo Ri. - Yes?

761
00:44:43.234 --> 00:44:46.333
What was that again? Heinrich?

762
00:44:46.333 --> 00:44:47.504
Hold on.

763
00:44:51.344 --> 00:44:53.274
"For every accident that causes a major injury,"

764
00:44:53.274 --> 00:44:55.913
"there are 29 accidents to cause minor injuries,"

765
00:44:56.114 --> 00:44:58.013
"and 300 accidents that cause no injuries."

766
00:44:58.013 --> 00:44:59.053
Noo Ri.

767
00:45:00.583 --> 00:45:02.183
Replay the dash cam footages...

768
00:45:02.183 --> 00:45:03.254
of the illegally parked cars.

769
00:45:03.254 --> 00:45:04.453
From which date do we start?

770
00:45:04.453 --> 00:45:06.123
- Everything. - Why?

771
00:45:06.123 --> 00:45:07.393
What is this for?

772
00:45:08.964 --> 00:45:10.024
I'm playing it now.

773
00:45:11.194 --> 00:45:12.364
Here.

774
00:45:19.703 --> 00:45:20.774
Stop.

775
00:45:23.243 --> 00:45:24.314
Rewind.

776
00:45:26.743 --> 00:45:27.844
Again.

777
00:45:28.984 --> 00:45:30.044
Stop.

778
00:45:30.683 --> 00:45:31.783
Rewind.

779
00:45:32.384 --> 00:45:33.413
Zoom in.

780
00:45:37.353 --> 00:45:38.553
It's shaking.

781
00:45:40.723 --> 00:45:41.824
Unbelievable.

782
00:45:42.294 --> 00:45:43.464
When was this filmed?

783
00:45:43.464 --> 00:45:45.634
September 16, 2 days before the accident.

784
00:45:45.634 --> 00:45:47.064
If the building was constructed properly...

785
00:45:47.064 --> 00:45:48.904
It shouldn't shake more than once.

786
00:45:48.904 --> 00:45:50.634
Where's Min Joon?

787
00:45:51.933 --> 00:45:53.404
How do I know?

788
00:45:54.944 --> 00:45:56.074
Goodness.

789
00:45:57.643 --> 00:45:59.143
I didn't mean that.

790
00:46:13.893 --> 00:46:15.864
Hi, Mr. Kim Min Joon.

791
00:46:16.223 --> 00:46:18.064
Mr. Choi?

792
00:46:18.094 --> 00:46:19.594
That's right.

793
00:46:20.404 --> 00:46:22.703
We meet again here.

794
00:46:22.904 --> 00:46:24.134
I know.

795
00:46:25.634 --> 00:46:26.703
Do you want some?

796
00:46:27.174 --> 00:46:30.174
You really don't have to. Thank you.

797
00:46:31.044 --> 00:46:32.774
Thank you for this.

798
00:46:32.774 --> 00:46:33.783
My pleasure.

799
00:46:38.013 --> 00:46:41.583
Gosh, it's sweet. It's really sweet.

800
00:46:46.294 --> 00:46:47.294
It's good.

801
00:46:48.663 --> 00:46:50.263
Specialist Mr. Kim Min Joon?

802
00:46:51.594 --> 00:46:54.203
Shall we continue what's good?

803
00:46:56.933 --> 00:46:57.973
Pardon?

804
00:47:05.114 --> 00:47:06.274
Cockroach?

805
00:47:07.344 --> 00:47:08.513
We meet again.

806
00:47:12.513 --> 00:47:14.524
Were you working undercover then?

807
00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:16.053
Isn't that illegal?

808
00:47:16.053 --> 00:47:17.953
I went to consult to build my own house.

809
00:47:22.024 --> 00:47:24.464
Drink this if you feel a little uncomfortable.

810
00:47:26.094 --> 00:47:27.933
They used different materials...

811
00:47:27.933 --> 00:47:30.033
from what they proposed to the client.

812
00:47:30.833 --> 00:47:32.433
I went through it as well.

813
00:47:32.433 --> 00:47:34.143
It's cheaper than the promised material,

814
00:47:34.143 --> 00:47:36.243
but it's used by many others, so it's all right.

815
00:47:36.243 --> 00:47:38.544
It's poor conscience, not poor construction?

816
00:47:38.544 --> 00:47:39.544
Exactly.

817
00:47:39.544 --> 00:47:41.384
They're known for advancing the due date...

818
00:47:41.384 --> 00:47:43.984
by pressing subcontractors during their construction.

819
00:47:48.583 --> 00:47:50.453
Haven't you read the inspection papers?

820
00:47:51.094 --> 00:47:52.953
It was because they went through some repair work.

821
00:47:53.294 --> 00:47:54.393
And...

822
00:47:54.723 --> 00:47:56.993
this isn't the collapsed building.

823
00:47:57.393 --> 00:47:59.393
How about this?

824
00:48:00.333 --> 00:48:02.564
It's Mr. Ahn's insurance claim...

825
00:48:02.564 --> 00:48:04.574
regarding the fire in 2012.

826
00:48:04.574 --> 00:48:07.103
Please read the details yourself.

827
00:48:08.344 --> 00:48:11.174
"One-story building collapse".

828
00:48:11.174 --> 00:48:13.174
How much insurance money did he take?

829
00:48:14.344 --> 00:48:15.814
He took 12,000 dollars from EIC Insurance...

830
00:48:15.814 --> 00:48:18.114
and 23,000 dollars from HG Insurance.

831
00:48:18.984 --> 00:48:21.353
Gosh, he's a repeat offender.

832
00:48:21.353 --> 00:48:23.583
That changes the story.

833
00:48:23.583 --> 00:48:25.424
The police will reinvestigate on this too.

834
00:48:25.424 --> 00:48:28.393
What should you do?

835
00:48:28.594 --> 00:48:31.064
We caught you just right.

836
00:48:32.064 --> 00:48:33.234
You didn't.

837
00:48:33.234 --> 00:48:36.564
And the building shook before the accident.

838
00:48:46.913 --> 00:48:48.743
Why would it shake if it had no problem?

839
00:48:48.814 --> 00:48:51.083
Isn't it impossible unless it was poorly constructed?

840
00:48:53.683 --> 00:48:55.683
Specialist Mr. Kim Min Joon.

841
00:48:56.324 --> 00:48:57.553
You knew it, right?

842
00:49:14.473 --> 00:49:15.803
Is this all?

843
00:49:19.844 --> 00:49:21.013
Then...

844
00:49:21.984 --> 00:49:23.754
Shall I begin now?

845
00:49:27.583 --> 00:49:29.154
Cheerfully.

846
00:49:29.723 --> 00:49:30.794
Professor.

847
00:49:31.294 --> 00:49:34.524
Hey, Ha Ri.

848
00:49:34.763 --> 00:49:37.263
Our newbie asked us for a little help.

849
00:49:40.404 --> 00:49:41.734
How have you been?

850
00:49:41.734 --> 00:49:44.303
You've become so pretty.

851
00:49:44.303 --> 00:49:45.473
I'm doing just the same.

852
00:49:45.473 --> 00:49:46.634
Goodness.

853
00:49:46.634 --> 00:49:47.973
What is this?

854
00:49:48.873 --> 00:49:50.143
Goodness.

855
00:49:51.074 --> 00:49:52.973
You're just so strange.

856
00:49:59.183 --> 00:50:01.723
Hey. All right.

857
00:50:02.183 --> 00:50:03.223
Mr. Kim.

858
00:50:03.853 --> 00:50:05.754
I'm not getting the picture here.

859
00:50:05.754 --> 00:50:08.194
You'll get wet if you stand here.

860
00:50:09.393 --> 00:50:11.993
All right. Shall we begin?

861
00:51:33.473 --> 00:51:35.344
- What? - Are you okay?

862
00:51:36.283 --> 00:51:37.283
What is this?

863
00:51:41.953 --> 00:51:44.553
The cause was resonance.

864
00:51:46.294 --> 00:51:48.623
Doesn't it look like these are shaking?

865
00:51:49.364 --> 00:51:52.533
All buildings have their own frequency.

866
00:51:52.734 --> 00:51:54.303
If that coincides with the frequency...

867
00:51:54.303 --> 00:51:55.833
resonating from the outside,

868
00:51:55.833 --> 00:51:57.333
the pulse gets bigger and bigger,

869
00:51:57.333 --> 00:51:58.803
which begins to cause vibrations.

870
00:51:59.134 --> 00:52:01.143
This is called resonance.

871
00:52:01.143 --> 00:52:02.344
A few days before the accident,

872
00:52:02.344 --> 00:52:04.944
some sports dancers rented out the yoga gym.

873
00:52:05.274 --> 00:52:07.214
The frequency caused by the dancers...

874
00:52:07.214 --> 00:52:09.143
and the pulse made by the speakers...

875
00:52:09.143 --> 00:52:12.884
coincided with the building's frequency,

876
00:52:12.884 --> 00:52:14.824
and the building began to shake.

877
00:52:15.783 --> 00:52:17.993
Steel-frame structures like billboards...

878
00:52:17.993 --> 00:52:19.694
are very vulnerable to waves.

879
00:52:20.254 --> 00:52:23.263
As the amplitude increased with constant stimulation,

880
00:52:23.263 --> 00:52:25.763
the billboard was impacted with larger waves.

881
00:52:26.763 --> 00:52:30.303
When another resonance broke out...

882
00:52:30.303 --> 00:52:32.774
after the billboard's clamps loosened...

883
00:52:35.373 --> 00:52:36.703
(September 18, 2017, 4:48pm)

884
00:52:36.703 --> 00:52:38.743
Are you telling me to believe that nonsense?

885
00:52:40.044 --> 00:52:43.044
Look, it's because of the strong wind.

886
00:52:43.044 --> 00:52:44.053
Hey.

887
00:52:44.214 --> 00:52:46.053
That's a bridge designed to withstand...

888
00:52:46.053 --> 00:52:47.853
the worst tornado.

889
00:52:48.984 --> 00:52:51.893
And researches revealed the cause as resonance.

890
00:52:52.154 --> 00:52:53.194
Resonance?

891
00:52:58.464 --> 00:53:00.033
If the cause was poor construction,

892
00:53:00.634 --> 00:53:03.703
the whole building would've collapsed.

893
00:53:04.803 --> 00:53:06.033
As you can see,

894
00:53:06.873 --> 00:53:07.873
the other parts are fine.

895
00:53:08.103 --> 00:53:09.544
Are you saying it wasn't poorly constructed?

896
00:53:13.044 --> 00:53:14.283
Mr. Kim.

897
00:53:15.683 --> 00:53:17.953
Your boss has claimed much insurance money...

898
00:53:17.953 --> 00:53:20.723
by faking accidents due to poor constructions.

899
00:53:20.723 --> 00:53:22.324
That's none of my business.

900
00:53:22.884 --> 00:53:23.893
The point is that...

901
00:53:24.154 --> 00:53:26.453
this one isn't due to poor construction.

902
00:53:28.294 --> 00:53:30.223
We will claim for the insurance money.

903
00:53:37.333 --> 00:53:39.734
(2.3 million dollars of insurance money paid.)

904
00:54:21.884 --> 00:54:23.643
- Hey, Han Wu. - Hey.

905
00:54:24.083 --> 00:54:26.353
How dare you pick my cabinet in the station?

906
00:54:26.884 --> 00:54:28.884
What are you talking about?

907
00:54:28.884 --> 00:54:30.154
Don't play innocent with me.

908
00:54:30.623 --> 00:54:32.393
You put documents of Ahn Chi Hoon's corruption,

909
00:54:32.393 --> 00:54:34.993
such as his bribery in my cabinet.

910
00:54:35.163 --> 00:54:36.223
What?

911
00:54:36.393 --> 00:54:37.663
It looks like...

912
00:54:38.294 --> 00:54:40.864
a few high officials will lose their jobs.

913
00:54:50.714 --> 00:54:52.143
After all, I find you here.

914
00:54:54.484 --> 00:54:55.614
You jerk.

915
00:54:55.884 --> 00:54:57.754
You two were in league from the beginning.

916
00:54:57.783 --> 00:54:59.353
- You two? - Isn't that true?

917
00:55:00.953 --> 00:55:01.984
Get out.

918
00:55:10.123 --> 00:55:12.594
It really isn't poor construction this time.

919
00:55:13.734 --> 00:55:14.803
What if...

920
00:55:15.504 --> 00:55:17.674
I prove that it wasn't poor construction?

921
00:55:17.674 --> 00:55:19.873
Is that possible?

922
00:55:20.174 --> 00:55:21.174
Instead,

923
00:55:21.774 --> 00:55:24.214
I'll take the compensation of 2.3 million dollars.

924
00:55:28.884 --> 00:55:29.884
Split it by 50 to 50.

925
00:55:36.283 --> 00:55:38.853
I'm sorry I wasn't much help. I apologize.

926
00:55:38.853 --> 00:55:40.993
No, you were very helpful.

927
00:55:41.393 --> 00:55:42.464
Hello.

928
00:55:43.794 --> 00:55:46.893
I had to express my gratitude.

929
00:55:47.404 --> 00:55:49.203
Oh, we didn't do much.

930
00:55:50.163 --> 00:55:51.333
Use it for your wife's treatment.

931
00:55:51.333 --> 00:55:54.603
We got more because we're a three-person family.

932
00:55:54.674 --> 00:55:55.674
Got what?

933
00:55:56.444 --> 00:55:58.074
The 2.3 million dollars of insurance money.

934
00:55:58.143 --> 00:56:00.984
Ahn Chi Hoon gave it out to every tenant.

935
00:56:01.283 --> 00:56:03.143
- What? - Ahn Chi Hoon did that?

936
00:56:04.314 --> 00:56:05.984
(Transfer 500,000 dollars)

937
00:56:05.984 --> 00:56:06.984
(Accident compensation)

938
00:56:06.984 --> 00:56:09.154
Your drinks are ready.

939
00:56:17.064 --> 00:56:18.663
(Accident compensation, Ahn Chi Hoon, 500,000)

940
00:56:21.064 --> 00:56:22.203
Is this the intellectual crime unit...

941
00:56:22.203 --> 00:56:23.433
of Daemyeong Police Station?

942
00:56:23.803 --> 00:56:25.603
I want to make a report.

943
00:56:25.873 --> 00:56:28.174
There is an illegal gambling going on...

944
00:56:28.174 --> 00:56:29.674
at Grint Hotel's suite in Nonhyeon-dong.

945
00:56:29.674 --> 00:56:30.944
It's room 1301.

946
00:56:31.714 --> 00:56:33.714
I saw them when I delivered room service.

947
00:56:33.844 --> 00:56:35.013
They're betting money by 100,000 dollars,

948
00:56:35.013 --> 00:56:37.013
and I think there were about 5 to 6 people.

949
00:56:39.814 --> 00:56:41.984
Stay still, everyone.

950
00:56:41.984 --> 00:56:43.123
If not, you will get hurt.

951
00:56:43.893 --> 00:56:45.324
That's a dead end.

952
00:56:45.993 --> 00:56:47.024
Request backup.

953
00:56:47.024 --> 00:56:48.024
Yes, sir.

954
00:56:48.663 --> 00:56:50.123
Hello, sir.

955
00:56:50.433 --> 00:56:52.533
Goodness, you are a familiar face.

956
00:56:56.234 --> 00:56:58.634
Where are you going? I'm here to deliver these.

957
00:56:58.634 --> 00:57:00.373
- Right now? - Darn it.

958
00:57:04.473 --> 00:57:05.944
Kim Min Joon, that punk.

959
00:57:05.944 --> 00:57:07.814
He gave out the money to all the tenants,

960
00:57:07.814 --> 00:57:10.614
and reported Ahn Chi Hoon to the police.

961
00:57:10.614 --> 00:57:12.283
He's a modern day Robin Hood.

962
00:57:12.283 --> 00:57:14.283
A con man is just a con man.

963
00:57:15.524 --> 00:57:16.524
Where is he?

964
00:57:17.154 --> 00:57:18.524
I do have his location, but...

965
00:57:20.493 --> 00:57:22.694
He's right here in our office.

966
00:57:23.424 --> 00:57:24.663
He must've taken it off.

967
00:57:24.964 --> 00:57:27.033
Goodness, how will I get this kid?

968
00:57:28.433 --> 00:57:29.634
Does it say he's still here?

969
00:57:46.884 --> 00:57:48.154
Mr. Kim Min Joon.

970
00:57:49.223 --> 00:57:50.553
Where are you now?

971
00:57:55.194 --> 00:57:56.393
You jerk.

972
00:57:57.094 --> 00:57:59.993
So this is how I get to meet my tenants.

973
00:58:00.364 --> 00:58:01.404
Your tenants?

974
00:58:02.964 --> 00:58:04.873
What kind of a landlord would allow anyone...

975
00:58:04.873 --> 00:58:06.333
to bring in a fish tank and shake up the building?

976
00:58:07.603 --> 00:58:08.844
I bought it out.

977
00:58:10.574 --> 00:58:12.674
They say, landlords before the Creator.

978
00:58:12.743 --> 00:58:13.814
You know, don't you?

979
00:58:14.114 --> 00:58:18.053
So is the landlord here to see the tenants himself?

980
00:58:18.413 --> 00:58:19.953
I didn't come for nothing.

981
00:58:20.884 --> 00:58:22.824
I came because I must get something from you.

982
00:58:23.754 --> 00:58:24.893
Don't you remember?

983
00:58:25.493 --> 00:58:27.123
What will you give me if I win this bet?

984
00:58:27.123 --> 00:58:28.123
What do you want?

985
00:58:29.163 --> 00:58:30.933
Mad Dog.

986
00:58:32.094 --> 00:58:33.163
Give it to me.

987
00:58:33.333 --> 00:58:35.103
Are you crazy?

988
00:58:36.703 --> 00:58:39.103
Manager Park of Taeyang Insurance...

989
00:58:39.234 --> 00:58:40.904
seemed to be pretty free nowadays.

990
00:58:41.703 --> 00:58:44.674
Pentium, Cheetah, Player Jang,

991
00:58:45.643 --> 00:58:48.743
and Mad Dog, Choi Kang Woo.

992
00:58:49.384 --> 00:58:51.083
Do you want me to bring the proof...

993
00:58:51.083 --> 00:58:53.683
to all the illegal deeds which you've done...

994
00:58:53.853 --> 00:58:55.223
in the name of catching con artists?

995
00:59:03.194 --> 00:59:05.634
Where did you learn to bluff?

996
00:59:07.234 --> 00:59:08.933
How do you know if I'm bluffing?

997
00:59:10.064 --> 00:59:11.174
Do you want to bet?

998
00:59:12.634 --> 00:59:15.473
Let's bet the most precious thing in life.

999
00:59:16.574 --> 00:59:19.044
Something you can't change even if you die.

1000
00:59:19.643 --> 00:59:21.944
Something you can't throw out even if you die.

1001
00:59:22.944 --> 00:59:24.484
Something you can't erase...

1002
00:59:24.683 --> 00:59:26.114
even if you die.

1003
00:59:26.553 --> 00:59:27.683
What's that?

1004
00:59:29.853 --> 00:59:30.853
Family.

1005
00:59:34.694 --> 00:59:36.594
This time, let's bet our family.

1006
00:59:42.933 --> 00:59:45.574
My dear.

1007
00:59:47.174 --> 00:59:48.774
My son.

1008
01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:44.194
(Mad Dog)

1009
01:00:44.634 --> 01:00:47.663
He took a total of 670,000 dollars of money.

1010
01:00:47.663 --> 01:00:50.433
There's no fraud who would kill a man the first time.

1011
01:00:50.433 --> 01:00:52.103
Could he be an accomplice?

1012
01:00:53.033 --> 01:00:55.404
Find something useful for the case?

1013
01:00:55.404 --> 01:00:56.703
What should I do?

1014
01:00:56.703 --> 01:00:57.973
You aren't alone.

1015
01:00:57.973 --> 01:01:00.044
Don't go in by yourself!

1016
01:01:00.344 --> 01:01:02.214
Cheetah! Be careful!

1017
01:01:02.214 --> 01:01:03.583
Two years ago,

1018
01:01:03.754 --> 01:01:05.453
we almost met.

1019
01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:07.083
No!

1020
01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:08.683
Don't think.

1021
01:01:08.754 --> 01:01:10.324
Don't judge.

1022
01:01:10.324 --> 01:01:13.763
Right now, I'm leaking inside information.

1023
01:01:13.864 --> 01:01:15.893
You'll have to continue living, Kang Woo.

1024
01:01:15.993 --> 01:01:18.533
You'll pay 3.4 million dollars, won't you?

1025
01:01:18.993 --> 01:01:21.864
I'm Kim Bum Joon's brother Kim Min Joon.
