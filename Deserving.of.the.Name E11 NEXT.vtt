00:00:18.563 --> 00:00:19.803
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:24.743 --> 00:00:26.643
Are you okay?

3
00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:32.382
Hey.

4
00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:40.822
Yeon Kyung.

5
00:00:41.893 --> 00:00:43.893
She doesn't want that.

6
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.203
Yeon Kyung.

7
00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:04.682
Yeon Kyung.

8
00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:36.543
Oh, my.

9
00:01:38.343 --> 00:01:39.543
She's not here, right?

10
00:01:41.752 --> 00:01:43.252
She clearly isn't here.

11
00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:45.852
It wasn't a hit-and-run.

12
00:01:57.393 --> 00:01:58.502
What...

13
00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:01.873
is this?

14
00:02:18.353 --> 00:02:19.483
How...

15
00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:21.693
did this happen?

16
00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:50.112
Did you recover your senses?

17
00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:53.122
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

18
00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:00.263
I am sorry.

19
00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:04.763
But do not worry. We know how to go back.

20
00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:06.633
Let us go.

21
00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:14.973
You should have just left me.

22
00:03:18.342 --> 00:03:20.612
You should have just left me to die.

23
00:03:21.883 --> 00:03:25.423
What... What do you mean?

24
00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:27.152
Why would you say that?

25
00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:32.062
Let us go.

26
00:03:54.342 --> 00:03:55.453
When you fall down,

27
00:03:56.082 --> 00:03:58.353
it is not a bad idea to rest for a while.

28
00:04:00.122 --> 00:04:01.723
You should take a rest here.

29
00:04:21.042 --> 00:04:23.412
Everything happens so quickly there.

30
00:04:23.912 --> 00:04:25.813
It was hard for me to get a hold of myself.

31
00:04:26.212 --> 00:04:27.212
But here,

32
00:04:28.683 --> 00:04:30.582
it feels like the time has stopped.

33
00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:35.922
There are no loud noises that numb your ears,

34
00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:38.792
and there is no fine dust...

35
00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:44.703
that suffocates you.

36
00:04:52.272 --> 00:04:54.672
This is what the village I grew up in felt like.

37
00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:57.143
There was a well in the middle,

38
00:04:57.313 --> 00:04:59.013
and in the morning,

39
00:04:59.412 --> 00:05:01.683
women will meet there with buckets and talk.

40
00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:03.453
Next to them,

41
00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:06.823
children would play with water until they get scolded.

42
00:05:07.852 --> 00:05:11.693
Come to think of it, I miss those days...

43
00:05:12.893 --> 00:05:15.332
when I would play with my friends...

44
00:05:17.662 --> 00:05:19.563
without any worries.

45
00:05:22.902 --> 00:05:25.542
There must be a well here somewhere.

46
00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:30.143
I will get some water to quench my thirst.

47
00:05:30.143 --> 00:05:31.482
Stay here, and rest.

48
00:05:43.352 --> 00:05:45.462
Can you feel the heart...

49
00:05:46.092 --> 00:05:47.323
that you fixed for me?

50
00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:49.332
Dad.

51
00:05:49.863 --> 00:05:51.433
Dad.

52
00:05:51.763 --> 00:05:53.503
Dad.

53
00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.772
Dad.

54
00:05:56.032 --> 00:05:57.503
Dad.

55
00:06:32.172 --> 00:06:35.573
Why did this come back here?

56
00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:38.383
Why is it in Joseon again?

57
00:06:44.823 --> 00:06:46.022
Should I...

58
00:06:46.782 --> 00:06:49.123
need to thank you for saving my life?

59
00:06:50.753 --> 00:06:52.623
Or should I resent you...

60
00:06:53.592 --> 00:06:55.133
for not letting me go?

61
00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.183
Eat this.

62
00:07:47.683 --> 00:07:49.953
Yeon Kyung! Yeon Kyung.

63
00:07:54.922 --> 00:07:56.652
Where did you get that rice ball?

64
00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:09.373
You should drink this first. You will feel better.

65
00:08:11.643 --> 00:08:14.402
This is normally what women do to passerby.

66
00:08:20.282 --> 00:08:22.582
I put it there so that you would not get...

67
00:08:22.582 --> 00:08:24.183
an upset stomach after drinking hurriedly.

68
00:08:32.092 --> 00:08:33.263
Just like that,

69
00:08:34.863 --> 00:08:36.192
we need to go slowly...

70
00:08:37.562 --> 00:08:38.733
so that we would not get an upset stomach.

71
00:08:52.643 --> 00:08:55.152
Gosh, what are they doing?

72
00:08:59.353 --> 00:09:02.353
The Japanese soldiers are coming! The Japanese soldiers are coming!

73
00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:05.822
Run away! Run away!

74
00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:20.942
We need to leave.

75
00:09:41.532 --> 00:09:43.863
Dad. Dad.

76
00:09:47.432 --> 00:09:48.702
Dad.

77
00:09:48.702 --> 00:09:51.743
Dad. Dad. Dad.

78
00:09:51.743 --> 00:09:55.172
Dad. Dad. Dad.

79
00:09:55.473 --> 00:09:58.442
Dad. Dad. Dad.

80
00:10:13.493 --> 00:10:14.692
Who is he?

81
00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:17.363
He's my grandfather's guest.

82
00:10:17.763 --> 00:10:19.263
I came from far away.

83
00:10:32.013 --> 00:10:34.343
Is that what happened?

84
00:10:35.282 --> 00:10:36.353
Then,

85
00:10:37.152 --> 00:10:38.422
I thought...

86
00:10:38.983 --> 00:10:41.723
it was better for her to have lost her memory.

87
00:10:43.522 --> 00:10:45.192
It must have come back.

88
00:10:49.162 --> 00:10:50.963
I will go and see her.

89
00:10:51.802 --> 00:10:53.463
Do not worry.

90
00:11:00.473 --> 00:11:03.572
Why aren't any of them calling me?

91
00:11:12.883 --> 00:11:15.893
I heard that Heo Bong Tak was your guest.

92
00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:17.593
Who is he?

93
00:11:17.623 --> 00:11:18.763
You know him, right?

94
00:11:18.763 --> 00:11:21.292
Why are you asking me strange questions...

95
00:11:21.532 --> 00:11:22.633
all of a sudden?

96
00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:25.302
He told me he came from somewhere far.

97
00:11:25.562 --> 00:11:26.662
Where is that?

98
00:11:26.662 --> 00:11:28.733
Why would you ask me that?

99
00:11:28.733 --> 00:11:29.733
At first,

100
00:11:30.133 --> 00:11:32.772
I thought he was a fake doctor with no license.

101
00:11:32.772 --> 00:11:34.172
And then, I thought he was a fraud...

102
00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:36.113
that my grandfather had helped.

103
00:11:36.442 --> 00:11:37.883
But I thought about it,

104
00:11:37.883 --> 00:11:39.743
and there were so many strange things.

105
00:11:39.743 --> 00:11:40.743
Who is he?

106
00:11:40.743 --> 00:11:42.282
Strange things?

107
00:11:43.113 --> 00:11:44.412
What strange things?

108
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.952
Like his name, clothes, and how he talks...

109
00:11:48.753 --> 00:11:49.853
The strangest thing...

110
00:11:50.322 --> 00:11:52.062
is that he disappeared in front of my eyes.

111
00:11:52.062 --> 00:11:53.723
Together with Yeon Kyung.

112
00:11:53.723 --> 00:11:54.792
What?

113
00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:57.562
He did that again?

114
00:11:57.963 --> 00:11:58.963
Again?

115
00:11:59.032 --> 00:12:00.963
Does that mean he did that the last time too?

116
00:12:01.473 --> 00:12:04.302
Grandfather, please tell me.

117
00:12:04.302 --> 00:12:05.672
Who is he?

118
00:12:05.672 --> 00:12:07.843
Where did they go and how?

119
00:12:08.343 --> 00:12:09.343
Gosh.

120
00:12:09.973 --> 00:12:11.343
- Grandfather. - What?

121
00:12:12.282 --> 00:12:13.843
- Mr. Choi. - Mr. Choi.

122
00:12:13.843 --> 00:12:15.853
- What is it? - Are you all right?

123
00:12:15.853 --> 00:12:18.822
No, I am fine. I'm fine.

124
00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:20.983
My chest felt a little stiff.

125
00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:26.322
I must have an upset stomach because of what I had yesterday.

126
00:12:26.322 --> 00:12:28.192
You should take some medicine.

127
00:12:28.192 --> 00:12:29.692
Take him inside.

128
00:12:29.692 --> 00:12:31.763
Okay. Let's go in.

129
00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:33.633
Let's go in.

130
00:12:34.233 --> 00:12:35.633
Why is he here this early?

131
00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:38.202
Why did you come outside in this cold weather?

132
00:12:43.473 --> 00:12:45.713
- Can't you reach her yet? - No.

133
00:12:45.713 --> 00:12:46.883
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

134
00:12:46.883 --> 00:12:49.113
Gosh, she must have been shocked.

135
00:12:49.113 --> 00:12:50.853
She's never done this before.

136
00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:53.822
I know. I didn't know she'd be like this.

137
00:12:53.822 --> 00:12:54.893
I'm worried.

138
00:12:54.893 --> 00:12:56.753
When it happens to someone who normally doesn't do that,

139
00:12:56.753 --> 00:12:58.062
they hit rock bottom.

140
00:13:01.662 --> 00:13:03.162
- Hello. - Hello.

141
00:13:03.162 --> 00:13:05.302
How are Ha Ra's parents doing now?

142
00:13:05.302 --> 00:13:08.833
As you can imagine. They're holding on to Ha Ra.

143
00:13:11.603 --> 00:13:13.873
Where's Professor Hwang? Come here.

144
00:13:15.713 --> 00:13:18.513
What on earth happened? Death on the table?

145
00:13:18.513 --> 00:13:22.713
It was too late when they found her, so her heart was already damaged.

146
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:25.452
Dr. Choi Yeon Kyung tried her best until the last moment.

147
00:13:25.452 --> 00:13:27.723
- Are you sure it's not our fault? - What?

148
00:13:29.493 --> 00:13:30.792
Yes, sure.

149
00:13:31.893 --> 00:13:34.123
The chairman is so mad now.

150
00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:38.233
At this rate, Director Ma will take the lead.

151
00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:42.973
I think we need to use that card now.

152
00:13:43.202 --> 00:13:45.873
- What kind of a card do you mean? - You know...

153
00:13:46.473 --> 00:13:47.973
The record of Chairman Park's son.

154
00:13:50.843 --> 00:13:54.243
But he entered here voluntarily as Yeon Kyung's patient.

155
00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:57.613
I also heard he turned himself in for the drug use.

156
00:13:58.753 --> 00:14:01.083
What's wrong with Dr. Choi all the time?

157
00:14:01.083 --> 00:14:02.493
Why is she so fickle?

158
00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:04.353
Is she playing a game with me?

159
00:14:05.593 --> 00:14:06.822
Where is she now?

160
00:14:24.172 --> 00:14:26.643
Look over there. Children are hiding there.

161
00:14:32.723 --> 00:14:33.883
I will go.

162
00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:37.123
I will go and bring the children. Stay right here.

163
00:15:19.233 --> 00:15:20.363
This way.

164
00:15:24.003 --> 00:15:26.643
Do not worry. I am here to save you.

165
00:15:31.442 --> 00:15:32.713
We do not have time. Hurry.

166
00:15:33.883 --> 00:15:35.312
Let us go with him.

167
00:16:59.863 --> 00:17:02.633
- Hold my hand now. - What about these kids?

168
00:17:03.503 --> 00:17:04.802
Can they go with us?

169
00:17:07.912 --> 00:17:10.143
We can't leave them here.

170
00:17:12.613 --> 00:17:14.083
What are these people?

171
00:17:14.883 --> 00:17:16.313
Hey, you two.

172
00:17:17.152 --> 00:17:18.523
Are you people of Joseon?

173
00:17:20.252 --> 00:17:21.553
You are.

174
00:17:23.922 --> 00:17:24.962
Kill them!

175
00:17:30.992 --> 00:17:32.133
Stop it!

176
00:17:43.972 --> 00:17:45.242
Thank you.

177
00:17:46.242 --> 00:17:47.512
I appreciate it.

178
00:17:51.523 --> 00:17:54.152
I told you not to break away from the camp.

179
00:17:54.152 --> 00:17:57.393
To loot the villages in Joseon...

180
00:17:57.393 --> 00:17:59.462
is on each platoon's discretion, isn't it?

181
00:18:02.262 --> 00:18:03.732
He is a doctor.

182
00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.162
Bring him, and let him treat Suzuki.

183
00:18:07.533 --> 00:18:09.773
How do you know that, General?

184
00:18:09.773 --> 00:18:11.643
When I got hurt before,

185
00:18:13.202 --> 00:18:15.073
he treated me.

186
00:18:18.543 --> 00:18:21.143
Is killing one more person of Joseon important to us?

187
00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:25.482
Or is saving one more comrade of us important to us?

188
00:18:27.922 --> 00:18:30.752
You are right. Rather than being killed right now,

189
00:18:30.752 --> 00:18:33.023
being killed after treating a Japanese soldier...

190
00:18:33.692 --> 00:18:35.432
will be an honor to that man of Joseon.

191
00:18:40.633 --> 00:18:43.002
Bring the woman and children as hostage.

192
00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:45.043
Leave the woman and children.

193
00:18:45.043 --> 00:18:46.502
Take that man to the quarter.

194
00:18:46.502 --> 00:18:47.843
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

195
00:18:48.643 --> 00:18:50.912
Let me go. What are you doing?

196
00:18:50.912 --> 00:18:52.043
Let go of me!

197
00:18:52.143 --> 00:18:53.883
Excuse me! Wait!

198
00:18:56.613 --> 00:18:58.123
Yeon Kyung!

199
00:19:00.353 --> 00:19:02.922
Hold on! Where are you taking the woman and children?

200
00:19:04.793 --> 00:19:06.063
It will be all right.

201
00:19:08.793 --> 00:19:10.833
Yeon Kyung! Wait!

202
00:19:11.732 --> 00:19:13.603
Let me stay with her and children!

203
00:19:14.232 --> 00:19:15.333
Wait!

204
00:19:23.113 --> 00:19:24.613
Brother!

205
00:19:24.613 --> 00:19:26.313
Wait! Seol!

206
00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.212
Seol! Seol!

207
00:19:32.682 --> 00:19:33.883
Let me go!

208
00:19:38.823 --> 00:19:40.192
Let go of me!

209
00:19:41.123 --> 00:19:42.232
Excuse me.

210
00:19:53.742 --> 00:19:55.412
I should have left you...

211
00:19:55.972 --> 00:19:57.412
to die that time.

212
00:19:57.543 --> 00:19:59.182
How can you bite the hand that fed you?

213
00:19:59.643 --> 00:20:02.152
Did you forget that she is the one who saved your life?

214
00:20:05.053 --> 00:20:06.922
You made the choice at that time.

215
00:20:08.023 --> 00:20:09.452
However, the tables have turned now.

216
00:20:15.192 --> 00:20:16.692
You must save this patient.

217
00:20:23.773 --> 00:20:25.902
Do you think I would make the same mistake again?

218
00:20:27.672 --> 00:20:30.313
If innocent people lose their lives by someone I saved,

219
00:20:30.472 --> 00:20:32.343
then it is the same as I killed those innocent people.

220
00:20:33.083 --> 00:20:35.113
I am telling you that I will not make such a mistake again!

221
00:20:35.113 --> 00:20:36.583
This is what that woman said.

222
00:20:37.682 --> 00:20:42.023
How someone lives after she saves him is up to his choice.

223
00:20:43.252 --> 00:20:44.492
She is just...

224
00:20:46.393 --> 00:20:48.492
trying her best as a doctor.

225
00:20:48.732 --> 00:20:50.593
Finding out the result of her deed,

226
00:20:52.133 --> 00:20:54.162
she must be devastated now.

227
00:20:54.162 --> 00:20:55.633
That is her business.

228
00:20:56.932 --> 00:20:58.803
If you cannot save this patient,

229
00:20:59.902 --> 00:21:03.472
you, that woman, and children will all die.

230
00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:15.192
The duty and good will of a doctor...

231
00:21:16.123 --> 00:21:17.793
can sometimes turn into harm.

232
00:21:22.293 --> 00:21:23.793
He was right.

233
00:21:25.803 --> 00:21:26.962
Does it hurt a lot?

234
00:21:37.412 --> 00:21:38.813
You got hurt.

235
00:21:44.482 --> 00:21:45.853
I don't have my bag now.

236
00:21:47.523 --> 00:21:49.252
I can't do anything for you.

237
00:21:50.152 --> 00:21:51.563
I can help you.

238
00:22:01.303 --> 00:22:02.633
Brother.

239
00:22:04.033 --> 00:22:06.543
I am scared. Are we...

240
00:22:08.412 --> 00:22:09.773
going to die?

241
00:22:09.773 --> 00:22:12.643
No, we will not die. I will not let them kill us.

242
00:22:14.982 --> 00:22:17.212
Your mom and dad must be worried.

243
00:22:18.623 --> 00:22:20.853
We do not have parents.

244
00:22:24.962 --> 00:22:26.863
Due to an epidemic the year before last,

245
00:22:27.893 --> 00:22:29.533
they passed away.

246
00:22:36.273 --> 00:22:39.702
I will protect my sister.

247
00:22:52.783 --> 00:22:54.623
Did you hear what the mister said a while ago?

248
00:22:57.252 --> 00:22:58.462
Do not worry.

249
00:22:59.563 --> 00:23:01.432
That mister will save us.

250
00:23:19.512 --> 00:23:21.452
That is not how it should be.

251
00:23:22.512 --> 00:23:25.182
Promise that you will let the woman and the children live.

252
00:23:26.283 --> 00:23:28.053
Then I will treat the wounded.

253
00:23:28.192 --> 00:23:29.593
Are you that confident?

254
00:23:29.652 --> 00:23:30.893
Promise.

255
00:23:31.053 --> 00:23:33.323
Can you trust my promise?

256
00:23:34.833 --> 00:23:37.393
I will trust the promise of whom the woman saved.

257
00:23:55.912 --> 00:23:57.113
His bowels are filled too much with water.

258
00:23:57.823 --> 00:24:00.652
In this condition, even a slight mistake may be critical for him.

259
00:24:00.652 --> 00:24:02.323
Are you saying you cannot save him?

260
00:24:10.962 --> 00:24:11.962
His pulse is...

261
00:24:12.702 --> 00:24:14.063
beating irregularly.

262
00:24:14.773 --> 00:24:16.232
If you do anything rashly,

263
00:24:17.573 --> 00:24:19.103
I will not forgive you.

264
00:25:23.873 --> 00:25:25.573
Why are you not taking out all the water?

265
00:25:27.702 --> 00:25:30.143
The patient will die if I take it all out now.

266
00:25:30.273 --> 00:25:32.212
That is why I left some on purpose.

267
00:26:47.053 --> 00:26:48.222
Feed him ground radish seeds,

268
00:26:48.222 --> 00:26:51.192
decocted Angelica gigas, Chinese pepper seeds, and garden rhubarb.

269
00:26:51.422 --> 00:26:54.023
He will get better little by little after three days.

270
00:27:13.843 --> 00:27:15.012
General.

271
00:27:17.553 --> 00:27:18.982
Can you hear me?

272
00:27:21.353 --> 00:27:22.853
You are safe now.

273
00:27:35.073 --> 00:27:36.073
Come out.

274
00:27:42.742 --> 00:27:44.113
Let go!

275
00:27:44.113 --> 00:27:46.412
- No. - Let go of me.

276
00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:49.353
Please don't.

277
00:27:49.353 --> 00:27:52.023
Where are you taking us?

278
00:27:52.383 --> 00:27:54.652
Let go!

279
00:28:29.323 --> 00:28:31.262
Are you okay?

280
00:28:31.262 --> 00:28:33.823
What about you? Are you okay?

281
00:28:33.823 --> 00:28:34.992
I am all right.

282
00:28:35.732 --> 00:28:38.833
- Are you okay? - Yes.

283
00:28:43.873 --> 00:28:46.543
I will not thank you for keeping your promise.

284
00:28:47.143 --> 00:28:48.843
Thank you...

285
00:28:49.873 --> 00:28:51.113
for saving Suzuki.

286
00:28:52.982 --> 00:28:54.752
Are there a lot of doctors like you...

287
00:28:55.912 --> 00:28:57.412
in Joseon Dynasty?

288
00:29:00.083 --> 00:29:01.952
Why do you ask such a thing?

289
00:29:02.523 --> 00:29:03.623
We need...

290
00:29:05.393 --> 00:29:07.623
a lot of doctors at a time like this.

291
00:29:14.162 --> 00:29:15.172
Oh, right.

292
00:29:28.613 --> 00:29:30.482
I did not know why,

293
00:29:31.523 --> 00:29:34.452
but I thought I should not reveal...

294
00:29:34.452 --> 00:29:37.593
this object and its owner.

295
00:29:39.422 --> 00:29:40.863
Was I right?

296
00:29:44.932 --> 00:29:46.833
I am not sure which infirmary you work for,

297
00:29:47.902 --> 00:29:49.273
but this belongs to you.

298
00:29:50.573 --> 00:29:51.942
So I shall return this to you.

299
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:03.412
What is your name?

300
00:30:04.623 --> 00:30:05.952
My name is Sayaga.

301
00:30:05.952 --> 00:30:09.293
(He was naturalized in Joseon during the Japanese invasions of Korea.)

302
00:30:10.353 --> 00:30:11.962
Will you remember my name?

303
00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:24.073
Are we going home now?

304
00:30:24.133 --> 00:30:27.373
Yes, that master saved us.

305
00:30:27.702 --> 00:30:29.143
You can walk home, right?

306
00:30:29.373 --> 00:30:30.742
Yes, I can.

307
00:30:30.742 --> 00:30:31.742
Let us go.

308
00:30:34.043 --> 00:30:35.383
What happened?

309
00:30:36.712 --> 00:30:38.323
Did you save that patient?

310
00:30:45.293 --> 00:30:47.293
He would have released us...

311
00:30:48.692 --> 00:30:50.162
even if I could not save him.

312
00:30:50.533 --> 00:30:51.662
I think...

313
00:30:52.662 --> 00:30:54.672
you saved all of our lives.

314
00:31:04.343 --> 00:31:05.482
My shoe.

315
00:31:05.512 --> 00:31:08.113
I will pick it up for you. Stay here.

316
00:31:49.093 --> 00:31:50.222
What happened?

317
00:31:57.333 --> 00:31:59.363
What do you think you are doing?

318
00:31:59.363 --> 00:32:04.103
I cannot stop you from releasing them since you're my superior,

319
00:32:04.103 --> 00:32:06.442
but it is up to me...

320
00:32:06.442 --> 00:32:08.442
whether to kill those released Joseon people or not.

321
00:32:33.363 --> 00:32:35.502
We need to hurry.

322
00:32:38.002 --> 00:32:39.002
Let us go.

323
00:32:52.783 --> 00:32:54.152
Excuse me.

324
00:33:01.662 --> 00:33:02.833
Wait a minute.

325
00:33:04.093 --> 00:33:05.232
A child is hurt.

326
00:33:08.303 --> 00:33:09.732
There is no time to waste.

327
00:33:10.303 --> 00:33:13.073
I am begging you. Please help us.

328
00:33:20.843 --> 00:33:22.182
Be careful.

329
00:33:30.952 --> 00:33:33.793
His pulse is in the most dangerous state.

330
00:33:36.793 --> 00:33:38.533
What are these wounds?

331
00:33:39.303 --> 00:33:40.363
They are bullets.

332
00:33:40.462 --> 00:33:42.502
Small metal pieces are stuck in his body.

333
00:33:42.972 --> 00:33:46.603
If we leave it, the wounds will fester, rot, and get septicemia.

334
00:34:08.833 --> 00:34:10.932
What is wrong with you?

335
00:34:14.003 --> 00:34:16.603
- I can't do this. - What do you mean?

336
00:34:16.873 --> 00:34:18.242
What if he also dies...

337
00:34:19.943 --> 00:34:21.143
after I treat him?

338
00:34:28.782 --> 00:34:30.012
Look at me.

339
00:34:32.753 --> 00:34:35.092
Come back to your senses, and listen to me.

340
00:34:37.322 --> 00:34:38.762
You are a doctor.

341
00:34:39.592 --> 00:34:43.393
You do your best to save a patient, whoever that patient is.

342
00:34:45.233 --> 00:34:47.532
You are the best doctor I know.

343
00:34:50.173 --> 00:34:51.702
I do not know what a gun is.

344
00:34:53.342 --> 00:34:56.742
I never treated nor ever seen a wound like this.

345
00:35:00.282 --> 00:35:01.782
I cannot do this by myself.

346
00:35:03.353 --> 00:35:05.123
The only person who can save this child...

347
00:35:06.483 --> 00:35:07.893
is you.

348
00:35:12.362 --> 00:35:15.762
Brother, do not die.

349
00:35:16.592 --> 00:35:18.132
Brother.

350
00:35:19.032 --> 00:35:20.503
Brother.

351
00:35:21.773 --> 00:35:25.373
Mom. Dad.

352
00:35:28.742 --> 00:35:30.173
Brother.

353
00:35:51.362 --> 00:35:54.503
I don't have my bag with me.

354
00:35:56.532 --> 00:35:58.003
I need to disinfect and anesthetize.

355
00:36:03.043 --> 00:36:04.583
Do you have any acid?

356
00:36:05.143 --> 00:36:08.083
We do not have acid,

357
00:36:08.713 --> 00:36:10.412
but we have toad secretion.

358
00:36:10.412 --> 00:36:13.623
Please give us that. We also need hot water to disinfect.

359
00:36:13.623 --> 00:36:15.853
Please boil water with salt.

360
00:36:16.222 --> 00:36:17.452
Yes.

361
00:36:17.452 --> 00:36:20.162
I will apply acupuncture to decrease the pain.

362
00:36:20.162 --> 00:36:21.492
Do you need anything else?

363
00:36:21.963 --> 00:36:23.793
I need to stop the bleeding and take care of infections.

364
00:36:24.862 --> 00:36:27.632
Do you have dried crown daisy, elm bark, and taro?

365
00:36:27.632 --> 00:36:29.003
Yes, we have.

366
00:36:29.632 --> 00:36:30.673
Okay.

367
00:36:31.643 --> 00:36:35.472
We also need clean white cloth, a needle, and some thread.

368
00:36:35.472 --> 00:36:37.443
What, thread?

369
00:36:37.443 --> 00:36:40.483
Do you have hemp thread and morus bark?

370
00:39:54.173 --> 00:39:57.472
The pulse became stable. I think he is not in danger anymore.

371
00:39:59.782 --> 00:40:01.412
You saved this child.

372
00:40:02.782 --> 00:40:03.912
No.

373
00:40:05.923 --> 00:40:07.123
This child...

374
00:40:08.693 --> 00:40:10.052
saved her brother.

375
00:40:53.963 --> 00:40:56.403
I thought I could never hold him in my hands again.

376
00:40:58.072 --> 00:41:00.342
Maybe that is why he is still here.

377
00:41:02.313 --> 00:41:06.182
He is smart and praiseworthy just like his owner.

378
00:41:08.882 --> 00:41:10.182
It's amazing.

379
00:41:11.382 --> 00:41:12.653
I did surgery with only this...

380
00:41:13.353 --> 00:41:14.923
in a place like this.

381
00:41:16.753 --> 00:41:18.423
I saved a life.

382
00:41:19.822 --> 00:41:23.793
Like you said, the child tried to save his sister's life.

383
00:41:24.963 --> 00:41:26.702
That must have saved his own life.

384
00:41:30.072 --> 00:41:31.972
What is more important than a doctor's skill...

385
00:41:32.403 --> 00:41:34.673
is the will of a patient wanting to live.

386
00:41:36.572 --> 00:41:38.543
That is the first thing I learned from my teacher.

387
00:41:40.782 --> 00:41:43.782
You must study the patient's mind first...

388
00:41:45.452 --> 00:41:47.753
to heighten their life force and healing power.

389
00:41:50.322 --> 00:41:51.722
The patient's mind.

390
00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:53.193
But...

391
00:41:56.233 --> 00:41:58.833
there is something he did not teach.

392
00:42:01.733 --> 00:42:03.472
That there are more patients you cannot save...

393
00:42:05.842 --> 00:42:07.572
than patients you can save...

394
00:42:09.112 --> 00:42:11.313
as a doctor.

395
00:42:15.882 --> 00:42:17.552
That is the fate of doctors...

396
00:42:19.753 --> 00:42:21.492
who are living in this land.

397
00:42:28.162 --> 00:42:30.793
I cried out loud for a day...

398
00:42:32.162 --> 00:42:34.302
when I first lost a patient.

399
00:42:37.572 --> 00:42:39.943
I would not even cry later.

400
00:42:55.393 --> 00:42:57.193
Death is sad,

401
00:42:58.762 --> 00:43:00.893
but it is beyond our power who decides to live or die.

402
00:43:03.992 --> 00:43:07.833
We only do our best to stop people from dying.

403
00:43:16.143 --> 00:43:18.242
Ha Ra and your father...

404
00:43:19.782 --> 00:43:20.943
must have...

405
00:43:22.382 --> 00:43:23.853
done their best until the end...

406
00:43:25.753 --> 00:43:28.452
because they knew how you felt.

407
00:43:46.373 --> 00:43:48.543
This is the gift she left for you.

408
00:43:49.713 --> 00:43:51.643
She wanted me to tell you...

409
00:43:52.643 --> 00:43:55.012
that this brightest one is her heart.

410
00:44:08.992 --> 00:44:10.893
Although her heart stopped from beating,

411
00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:14.202
her soul that was contained in her heart...

412
00:44:16.032 --> 00:44:17.972
still shines brightly like this.

413
00:44:27.996 --> 00:44:31.228
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 11 Live Up To Your Name, Dr. Heo/Deserving of the Name
"Who is Heo Im?"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

414
00:45:44.939 --> 00:45:46.439
Everything will be fine, right?

415
00:45:48.839 --> 00:45:51.580
My daughter will be safe, right?

416
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:53.979
I know...

417
00:45:54.749 --> 00:45:56.319
it's shameless of me to say this,

418
00:45:57.049 --> 00:46:00.049
but if you happen to run into her,

419
00:46:00.749 --> 00:46:03.859
please take good care of her like last time.

420
00:46:08.229 --> 00:46:11.299
I know you're in an awkward situation,

421
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.569
but please give me a few more days.

422
00:46:13.999 --> 00:46:16.470
Something came up to Dr. Heo.

423
00:46:17.439 --> 00:46:19.609
How could you say that?

424
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:21.379
I'm not your subordinate or something like that.

425
00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:25.280
This isn't only for my sake.

426
00:46:25.479 --> 00:46:29.220
Director Ma, did you just yell at me?

427
00:46:33.919 --> 00:46:36.490
I buttered him up a bit,

428
00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.530
and now, he thinks he's the president or something.

429
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:40.959
Goodness.

430
00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:45.729
Heo Im, that punk. I turned him into a human being,

431
00:46:45.729 --> 00:46:47.229
and he's behaving as he pleases.

432
00:46:47.629 --> 00:46:48.839
Where on earth is he?

433
00:46:49.299 --> 00:46:52.709
Did he go back to Joseon by any chance?

434
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.040
Where?

435
00:46:59.479 --> 00:47:00.479
Did you...

436
00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.049
just say Heo Im?

437
00:47:04.249 --> 00:47:06.649
Since when have you been standing there?

438
00:47:06.689 --> 00:47:08.459
Joseon?

439
00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.019
What was that about?

440
00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.790
You heard it wrong.

441
00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.729
- Grandpa. - I said, you heard it wrong.

442
00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:18.669
Things are complicated as is.

443
00:47:19.129 --> 00:47:20.530
Don't add up to it.

444
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:42.760
(Heo Bong Tak)

445
00:47:45.459 --> 00:47:46.530
Excuse me.

446
00:47:48.129 --> 00:47:49.729
The woman who was with you just now.

447
00:47:50.629 --> 00:47:51.629
Did she go somewhere?

448
00:47:51.629 --> 00:47:54.799
Master, I am Im from the Heo family.

449
00:47:54.839 --> 00:47:56.100
My name is Heo Im.

450
00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.709
In the Joseon Dynasty, our acupuncture skills were the best...

451
00:47:59.709 --> 00:48:01.280
among the three countries.

452
00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.649
The doctor at the top was...

453
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:08.749
Dr. Heo Im, the best acupuncturist in Joseon.

454
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.720
It doesn't make sense. He's Heo Im?

455
00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:15.560
Then does it mean...

456
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.459
the two are in Joseon now?

457
00:48:47.049 --> 00:48:49.560
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

458
00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.269
How is your back? Does it hurt a lot?

459
00:49:02.899 --> 00:49:04.910
Where is my sister?

460
00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.540
She's sleeping behind you.

461
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:19.490
Brother.

462
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.560
I am sorry.

463
00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:23.790
Because of me...

464
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:26.160
You...

465
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:29.060
It is all right, Dam.

466
00:49:29.459 --> 00:49:31.169
It is not your fault.

467
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.799
Do not cry.

468
00:49:35.999 --> 00:49:37.069
My...

469
00:49:37.709 --> 00:49:39.939
My shoe came off.

470
00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:42.510
That is why you...

471
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:50.620
I will buy you shoes that fit you well next time.

472
00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.149
So do not cry.

473
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.709
Look at you.

474
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.450
Goodness.

475
00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:30.859
Why are you staring at me like that?

476
00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:32.629
I don't look good in these clothes, do I?

477
00:50:32.629 --> 00:50:33.990
That is not true.

478
00:50:34.799 --> 00:50:37.560
You are pretty whichever clothes you wear.

479
00:50:40.399 --> 00:50:42.700
Walking like this, it seems like...

480
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:44.839
we are a family.

481
00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:47.269
What?

482
00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:51.280
I'm too young to have a big son like him.

483
00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.049
Gosh, I mean...

484
00:50:53.249 --> 00:50:55.180
In Joseon, people get married when they are about 15 years old.

485
00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.280
People in our age have kids this big.

486
00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:02.560
Then why did you not get married...

487
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.319
until now?

488
00:51:05.459 --> 00:51:08.700
I had so many women who went after me,

489
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:11.729
but I was busy treating people with my extraordinary medical skills.

490
00:51:11.729 --> 00:51:13.370
So I did not get a chance to find someone.

491
00:51:15.999 --> 00:51:17.439
That's the same as me.

492
00:51:17.439 --> 00:51:18.510
The same...

493
00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:22.939
Then we must be meant for each other...

494
00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.080
Shall we take some rest here?

495
00:51:27.149 --> 00:51:28.479
Don't your shoulders hurt?

496
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.519
Come to think of it...

497
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.120
Let us rest here for a while.

498
00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:41.799
It tickles.

499
00:51:47.269 --> 00:51:48.470
A little more.

500
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:09.760
Yes! Yeon Kyung, look here!

501
00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:13.189
Everything that grows...

502
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:15.899
on earth is nutritious.

503
00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:18.600
You need to eat the most important part.

504
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.930
Like this.

505
00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:21.740
You can eat that?

506
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.499
You should eat this too.

507
00:52:35.479 --> 00:52:36.780
Do you want the flowers too?

508
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:55.060
Excuse me.

509
00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.769
- Are you all right? - What happened?

510
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:03.100
As you can see, the Japanese soldiers have come.

511
00:54:03.669 --> 00:54:05.169
Everyone got hurt.

512
00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:07.169
But...

513
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.479
who are you?

514
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:13.979
Well, I...

515
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:16.350
Sir.

516
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.189
Kang? Is that you, Kang?

517
00:54:21.419 --> 00:54:23.419
Dam is here too.

518
00:54:23.419 --> 00:54:24.990
The children are alive.

519
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:26.229
Sir.

520
00:54:27.459 --> 00:54:29.060
Are you all right?

521
00:54:30.129 --> 00:54:31.430
Sir.

522
00:54:37.339 --> 00:54:41.209
I sewed up the skin so that the wounds would heal quickly.

523
00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:44.450
It will disappear after a while.

524
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:45.910
Really?

525
00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:48.419
- You sewed it up? - Yes.

526
00:54:49.049 --> 00:54:52.549
I have never seen a doctor treat patients before.

527
00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:55.620
Are you a doctor?

528
00:54:57.790 --> 00:54:58.959
Yes.

529
00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:01.419
When I first arrived at your world,

530
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:04.290
I was surprised by the ambulance.

531
00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:06.790
You could get treated whenever...

532
00:56:07.189 --> 00:56:09.459
and wherever they are.

533
00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:12.430
Yes, for most people.

534
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.100
Those people outside...

535
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.569
would hardly ever get to see a doctor in their lives.

536
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.339
At least in Hanyang, they have Haeminseo.

537
00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:29.680
We just used acupuncture and moxa cautery to circulate Qi.

538
00:56:30.319 --> 00:56:32.620
That way, they can get on with life and eat something.

539
00:56:32.919 --> 00:56:34.319
It is not much,

540
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:37.519
but that is all we can do.

541
00:56:44.769 --> 00:56:46.430
Why are you looking at me like that?

542
00:56:47.939 --> 00:56:49.540
I want to remember...

543
00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.540
the real side of you.

544
00:56:55.209 --> 00:56:58.410
I just did it because there were patients in front of me.

545
00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:00.310
That is what I did.

546
00:57:00.649 --> 00:57:01.950
Then tell me.

547
00:57:03.519 --> 00:57:05.249
Why are you...

548
00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:09.189
treating these people for nothing in return...

549
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:12.830
and worrying about them?

550
00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:22.939
Dam.

551
00:57:26.269 --> 00:57:29.709
Why is she suddenly like this?

552
00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.620
She must be in shock.

553
00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:21.660
It is all right. It is all right now.

554
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:27.370
Dam, it is all right.

555
00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:32.839
When the time comes, we will have time to talk about us.

556
00:58:33.169 --> 00:58:34.810
If I am right.

557
00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.720
Here.

558
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:53.689
Is Hanyang far away from here?

559
00:58:53.689 --> 00:58:55.359
Why do you ask?

560
00:58:55.499 --> 00:58:57.560
There is someone I need to meet.

561
00:58:58.499 --> 00:58:59.930
Who?

562
00:59:00.799 --> 00:59:01.899
Heo Jun.

563
00:59:02.299 --> 00:59:03.370
No,

564
00:59:04.299 --> 00:59:05.410
I mean, Master Heo Jun.

565
00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:08.479
Heo Jun? Do you mean the doctor?

566
00:59:08.479 --> 00:59:10.839
How do you know him?

567
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:13.180
That's what I want to find out.

568
00:59:14.419 --> 00:59:16.120
What does that...

569
00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:18.649
I will tell you everything later.

570
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:22.660
I am not sure about anything yet.

571
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:27.189
The Japanese soldiers are nearby.

572
00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:29.959
Do you not know that it is dangerous to be in Hanyang right now?

573
00:59:30.229 --> 00:59:32.030
I know. But...

574
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:34.899
if I don't see him now,

575
00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:38.310
I might not get another chance.

576
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:42.780
Maybe...

577
00:59:43.439 --> 00:59:45.049
I might find out...

578
00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:47.410
the reason why I met you...

579
00:59:47.819 --> 00:59:49.519
and why I came here.

580
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:05.330
I went through so much trouble,

581
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:07.759
but at least it did not last long.

582
01:00:14.199 --> 01:00:16.669
This is all thanks to her.

583
01:00:25.279 --> 01:00:27.410
If I leave Hanyang and evacuate,

584
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:29.419
I do not know when I will come back.

585
01:00:30.149 --> 01:00:32.989
I do not get to see you in the end.

586
01:00:34.489 --> 01:00:36.259
I hope you survive this war...

587
01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.660
so that we can meet in the future.

588
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:41.560
- Let us go. - Yes, master.

589
01:00:58.109 --> 01:00:59.549
What is that?

590
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:03.750
Excuse me.

591
01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.690
Where is that place that is on fire?

592
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:07.149
Do you not know?

593
01:01:08.219 --> 01:01:09.319
That is the palace.

594
01:01:09.319 --> 01:01:10.890
Why is the palace on fire?

595
01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:12.359
Did you not hear...

596
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:14.930
that the King ran away early this morning?

597
01:01:16.299 --> 01:01:18.370
The angry people...

598
01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:21.100
are setting everything on fire.

599
01:01:21.169 --> 01:01:23.339
He deserves to be ripped to pieces.

600
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:25.239
How could he run away leaving the people behind?

601
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.339
I cannot believe this.

602
01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:45.730
Even if you do not get to meet him,

603
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:47.730
do not get discouraged.

604
01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.699
He is the royal physician.

605
01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.500
If the king is on royal flight from the palace,

606
01:01:53.699 --> 01:01:56.270
Master Heo might have followed him.

607
01:01:58.339 --> 01:02:00.210
Okay, let us go.

608
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.210
Who are you?

609
01:02:09.319 --> 01:02:10.319
Dr. Heo.

610
01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.120
- Dr. Heo, I was worried. - Oh, my.

611
01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.020
It was true that you would be coming here.

612
01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.930
Mak Gae, wait.

613
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:20.730
Goodness, Mak Gae.

614
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.500
You changed your appearance...

615
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.199
to hide from the Minister of War?

616
01:02:25.199 --> 01:02:26.799
What could I do?

617
01:02:26.969 --> 01:02:28.469
After we ran away that time,

618
01:02:28.469 --> 01:02:31.770
he is doing everything to find you and I.

619
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:35.640
You are running away again.

620
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.210
That is not important.

621
01:02:37.509 --> 01:02:39.109
What happened?

622
01:02:39.279 --> 01:02:41.350
What did I see that day?

623
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:46.350
Why are you still here?

624
01:02:46.649 --> 01:02:48.020
Did I not tell you to leave Hanyang?

625
01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.120
How could I leave without you?

626
01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.190
We are all in this together, live or let die.

627
01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:56.029
Do you not know what times we are in?

628
01:02:56.399 --> 01:02:57.799
I do not know about that.

629
01:03:02.199 --> 01:03:03.799
She is here again.

630
01:03:07.239 --> 01:03:11.350
She is not a lady, but a village woman this time.

631
01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:16.279
I am here to meet Master Heo.

632
01:03:16.279 --> 01:03:20.690
He went to a village over the mountain to treat a patient.

633
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:23.259
Do you mean that he did not follow the king?

634
01:03:23.259 --> 01:03:25.730
He said that he cannot go right now because his leg was uncomfortable,

635
01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.859
but he will follow them later.

636
01:03:28.859 --> 01:03:31.199
So he went to treat other patients after that?

637
01:03:31.199 --> 01:03:32.529
When will he come back?

638
01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.870
He will not come back today.

639
01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.199
Maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

640
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:46.149
Do you know where he is?

641
01:03:50.419 --> 01:03:52.750
The roads are rugged. Be careful.

642
01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.529
I wanted to know since last time,

643
01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.029
but what kind of relationship do you have with each other?

644
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:15.310
Why are you staying at Master Heo's house?

645
01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:17.410
You did not answer my question.

646
01:04:19.779 --> 01:04:22.620
I had to leave Haeminseo, so I did not know what to do.

647
01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:25.989
Master Heo allowed me to stay here until you came back.

648
01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:28.719
Did he say I would come back?

649
01:04:29.489 --> 01:04:32.890
Yes, he said you would surely come back.

650
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:37.770
Looking at your hair,

651
01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:40.029
you did not want to come back according to your own will.

652
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:42.239
You must have caused trouble again.

653
01:04:42.669 --> 01:04:45.410
He thinks I will come back according to my own will.

654
01:04:51.649 --> 01:04:52.649
Gosh.

655
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:03.160
Look who we have here.

656
01:05:16.399 --> 01:05:19.069
Is that the woman from last time?

657
01:05:22.009 --> 01:05:24.180
Yes, I think you are right.

658
01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:25.350
Wait a minute.

659
01:05:26.379 --> 01:05:27.379
Look.

660
01:05:29.279 --> 01:05:32.250
I think those are warriors judging from their swords.

661
01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:34.250
Warriors?

662
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:38.690
What is this?

663
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.259
You.

664
01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:44.629
It is good to see you like this again.

665
01:05:52.009 --> 01:05:55.239
That girl helped Heo Im run away.

666
01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:59.680
He even had a girl.

667
01:06:01.649 --> 01:06:03.419
They must not recognize you.

668
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.319
Run away without looking back.

669
01:06:05.319 --> 01:06:07.219
I cannot do that without you.

670
01:06:07.419 --> 01:06:08.989
Did you not see last time?

671
01:06:09.919 --> 01:06:12.029
You have to leave for us to live.

672
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160
Hurry.

673
01:06:23.369 --> 01:06:25.740
- What is that girl? - Should I follow her?

674
01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.209
You do not have to do a troublesome deed like that.

675
01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:33.950
Heo Im, you punk.

676
01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:37.919
I cannot sleep at night because of you.

677
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:40.850
The almighty must be helping me.

678
01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:42.890
Who knew that we would put an end to this...

679
01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.230
on our way leaving Hanyang?

680
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:53.230
You became a dog while I was away.

681
01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:54.940
What?

682
01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:57.070
What did you say?

683
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.740
You punk.

684
01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.610
How could you tell humans from dogs...

685
01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:04.180
according to the clothes they wear?

686
01:07:04.209 --> 01:07:06.379
Your appearance...

687
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:09.680
is like that of dogs and pigs right now.

688
01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.320
Gosh.

689
01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:14.289
Dogs and pigs would be offended.

690
01:07:14.919 --> 01:07:17.629
What is he talking about?

691
01:07:17.629 --> 01:07:19.730
At least you are afraid of the people.

692
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:24.060
I take it that it is because you value your life...

693
01:07:25.499 --> 01:07:27.329
to run away in the middle of the night like this.

694
01:07:27.329 --> 01:07:28.339
You punk.

695
01:07:28.969 --> 01:07:30.940
How could a lowly life like you say that to me?

696
01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.940
A minster of the court...

697
01:07:32.869 --> 01:07:34.409
should protect people...

698
01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.640
and the king...

699
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.810
when in crisis.

700
01:07:40.379 --> 01:07:43.049
I cannot believe that a vulgar man like you,

701
01:07:43.049 --> 01:07:46.450
who betrayed the king and left the people to save his own life,

702
01:07:47.419 --> 01:07:49.619
is still talking about social ranks.

703
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:52.930
Are you not embarrassed...

704
01:07:53.129 --> 01:07:54.860
to face the lowly lives?

705
01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.730
You, you little...

706
01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.469
What are you doing?

707
01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:02.100
Make him shut his mouth.

708
01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.100
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

709
01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.039
Do not worry.

710
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:07.310
Pain like this is nothing to me now.

711
01:09:53.379 --> 01:09:55.680
Yeon Kyung.
