(Episode 2)

4
00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:30.493
Where am I?

5
00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:33.563
I don't have my cellphone.

6
00:00:44.703 --> 00:00:46.803
How creepy.

7
00:00:47.743 --> 00:00:50.173
How will a person get away with murder at a place like this?

8
00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.263
This is the blind spot.

9
00:01:10.332 --> 00:01:11.403
After...

10
00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:14.603
the main character lures the culprit to this spot...

11
00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:32.752
My gosh, it's not here either.

12
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:47.002
- Where's the sea snail restaurant? - My gosh, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:47.703 --> 00:01:49.832
I heard it's nearby.

14
00:02:21.103 --> 00:02:22.633
I'm on my way home.

15
00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:24.573
- Could I... - I'm almost home.

16
00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:33.783
We're in front of Gyeongbok Palace,

17
00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.212
but she's not here. She didn't go home either.

18
00:02:36.853 --> 00:02:39.323
What do we do? She's so bad with directions.

19
00:02:39.953 --> 00:02:41.253
She doesn't even know places she's been to before.

20
00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:18.823
You're quite amazing.

21
00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:21.693
How did you make your way out?

22
00:03:23.733 --> 00:03:25.233
Are you trying to survive?

23
00:03:32.973 --> 00:03:35.272
I'll live just like you.

24
00:03:38.342 --> 00:03:39.483
How pretty.

25
00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.043
Are you even scared?

26
00:04:08.943 --> 00:04:10.913
You scared me!

27
00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:13.312
It's nothing compared to how much you scared me.

28
00:04:13.582 --> 00:04:14.953
Why are you mad at me?

29
00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:16.182
Because I am.

30
00:04:16.182 --> 00:04:18.822
What are you talking about? I didn't mean it that way.

31
00:04:18.822 --> 00:04:20.752
Then what do you mean?

32
00:04:20.752 --> 00:04:23.023
I said "jagi" as a pronoun. You.

33
00:04:23.023 --> 00:04:25.923
I didn't say "jagi" as its other meaning, "honey".

34
00:04:25.923 --> 00:04:28.893
Same with me. I meant the pronoun.

35
00:04:29.562 --> 00:04:31.262
What's wrong with you?

36
00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:33.802
Why are you angry with me? Why are you making fun of me?

37
00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:36.802
I was so happy to see you that I almost ran into your arms.

38
00:04:46.713 --> 00:04:48.312
Do you know how scared I was?

39
00:04:50.112 --> 00:04:52.153
I walked and walked, but I was walking in circles.

40
00:04:52.153 --> 00:04:54.153
Do you know how many times I've been here already?

41
00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:01.963
We were searching for you for three hours.

42
00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.403
Won Joon and Hong Ah are waiting for you too.

43
00:05:05.403 --> 00:05:06.702
Give me your phone.

44
00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:07.773
I don't have one.

45
00:05:08.372 --> 00:05:09.372
Why not?

46
00:05:09.973 --> 00:05:11.702
There are people without phones these days?

47
00:05:11.942 --> 00:05:13.572
I can't afford it.

48
00:05:16.713 --> 00:05:19.283
Your shoes are probably more expensive than cellphones.

49
00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:21.752
That watch looks like it's a brand too.

50
00:05:21.952 --> 00:05:23.952
We must disagree on how we use money.

51
00:05:23.952 --> 00:05:25.083
Let's not talk about it.

52
00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:28.793
I tend to respect other people's values.

53
00:05:28.793 --> 00:05:30.923
Really? Then why did you say that?

54
00:05:32.862 --> 00:05:34.762
- I don't know. - You don't know.

55
00:05:34.893 --> 00:05:37.963
You have a strange habit.

56
00:05:38.562 --> 00:05:40.163
It's not nice to pick on people's words.

57
00:05:40.163 --> 00:05:42.173
Let's not criticize one's values either.

58
00:05:42.173 --> 00:05:44.973
Well, I normally respect other people's values.

59
00:05:44.973 --> 00:05:46.372
Then why did you say that?

60
00:05:55.882 --> 00:05:57.452
Let's go. Follow me.

61
00:05:57.483 --> 00:06:01.153
Right, do this too. We have to stretch before running.

62
00:06:03.252 --> 00:06:04.262
Can't we just walk?

63
00:06:04.262 --> 00:06:05.992
- No, we can't. - Gosh.

64
00:06:18.843 --> 00:06:20.002
It's raining.

65
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.083
Speed up. That way you'll dodge the rain.

66
00:06:24.242 --> 00:06:25.983
I saw it on "Curious World"...

67
00:06:25.983 --> 00:06:28.213
that you get just as wet whether you run or walk.

68
00:06:28.213 --> 00:06:31.483
It'd be foolish to run in order to dodge the rain.

69
00:06:31.622 --> 00:06:34.523
I'm a huge fan of "Curious World". This has got to be the truth.

70
00:06:34.952 --> 00:06:36.492
Please fall for it.

71
00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:39.963
Let's walk. I'm tired.

72
00:06:39.963 --> 00:06:41.132
Are you dumb?

73
00:06:41.463 --> 00:06:44.862
If you get to your destination fast, you won't be as wet.

74
00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:46.603
Don't you take speed and time into consideration?

75
00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:49.473
Maybe "Curious World" didn't teach you those things.

76
00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:51.643
You're smart. You didn't fall for it.

77
00:06:51.643 --> 00:06:54.143
It feels like an insult to hear it from someone dumb.

78
00:06:55.312 --> 00:06:57.783
How old are you? You look younger than me.

79
00:06:57.783 --> 00:06:59.612
Why are you bringing up age all of a sudden?

80
00:07:03.653 --> 00:07:04.682
Do you...

81
00:07:05.353 --> 00:07:06.783
want me to hold your hand?

82
00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:08.423
No.

83
00:07:10.692 --> 00:07:13.322
I don't want to run while holding a stranger's hand either.

84
00:07:14.132 --> 00:07:16.093
Fine, let's run.

85
00:07:16.262 --> 00:07:18.833
One, Two, One, Two.

86
00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:19.862
Five.

87
00:07:25.773 --> 00:07:27.512
Gosh, it's pouring.

88
00:07:28.372 --> 00:07:29.442
There.

89
00:08:15.853 --> 00:08:17.762
It's a great night to murder.

90
00:08:18.593 --> 00:08:20.322
There are no CCTV cameras here.

91
00:08:20.393 --> 00:08:21.893
Who are you trying to kill?

92
00:08:22.992 --> 00:08:24.533
It's my homework from my boss.

93
00:08:25.362 --> 00:08:26.963
I'm an assistant writer.

94
00:08:32.842 --> 00:08:34.043
Do you want to go out with me?

95
00:08:42.153 --> 00:08:43.383
Are you crazy?

96
00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:44.783
I'm not crazy.

97
00:08:45.383 --> 00:08:46.923
I'm crazy if I ask you out?

98
00:08:46.923 --> 00:08:48.893
Yes, you are. You can't be sane.

99
00:08:49.293 --> 00:08:51.523
You hardly know me, and you're asking me out?

100
00:08:51.523 --> 00:08:52.863
What do I have to know?

101
00:08:53.062 --> 00:08:54.562
Your age? Alma mater?

102
00:08:54.562 --> 00:08:56.462
I'm 23. I've already served in the army.

103
00:08:56.462 --> 00:08:57.962
Stop, stop.

104
00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:02.903
You're young, so you might think outer appearance is everything...

105
00:09:02.903 --> 00:09:04.472
when it comes to dating.

106
00:09:04.472 --> 00:09:06.003
It's true that you're pretty,

107
00:09:06.743 --> 00:09:08.773
but I wouldn't ask every pretty woman out.

108
00:09:15.682 --> 00:09:17.352
I can understand you're taken by surprise...

109
00:09:17.352 --> 00:09:18.682
by this sudden proposal.

110
00:09:19.383 --> 00:09:20.952
However, I'm not taking this lightly.

111
00:09:26.192 --> 00:09:27.462
What time is it now?

112
00:09:30.062 --> 00:09:31.732
It's 12:37am.

113
00:09:32.403 --> 00:09:34.673
We were at Gyeongbok Palace at around 7:40pm,

114
00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:35.832
and that's when we first met.

115
00:09:35.832 --> 00:09:37.602
If it's 12:37am now...

116
00:09:39.102 --> 00:09:40.913
It hasn't even been five hours.

117
00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:44.383
Out of those 5 hours, we properly talked for 30 minutes.

118
00:09:44.743 --> 00:09:46.182
And you're saying you're serious?

119
00:09:46.182 --> 00:09:49.113
It only took me a minute to choose cooking as my vocation.

120
00:09:49.113 --> 00:09:52.023
Falling in love at first sight is a physical love. It's dangerous.

121
00:09:52.023 --> 00:09:53.682
That's why it's hard.

122
00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:55.592
And since it's hard, I'm not taking this lightly.

123
00:09:57.523 --> 00:09:59.623
I can't agree with you about the physical part,

124
00:09:59.763 --> 00:10:00.962
since I don't know much about it.

125
00:10:03.062 --> 00:10:06.602
You're really good at talking. And I thought I was pretty good.

126
00:10:08.702 --> 00:10:11.572
I would have fallen for it if I was a bit younger.

127
00:10:12.472 --> 00:10:13.673
Then fall for it.

128
00:10:26.582 --> 00:10:28.322
Why do you want to date me?

129
00:10:28.423 --> 00:10:30.253
You just said you won't date just any pretty woman.

130
00:10:32.023 --> 00:10:33.192
My heart is falling for you.

131
00:10:36.393 --> 00:10:37.702
Why are you talking so casually?

132
00:10:37.802 --> 00:10:39.232
You started it.

133
00:10:42.873 --> 00:10:44.643
I started first, didn't I?

134
00:10:46.342 --> 00:10:47.613
I didn't notice.

135
00:10:52.812 --> 00:10:54.582
Does it make you mad that I asked you out?

136
00:10:55.883 --> 00:10:57.923
I feel like I was looked down on.

137
00:10:58.753 --> 00:11:01.692
A younger guy asked me out.

138
00:11:02.123 --> 00:11:05.623
Do I look so easy to everyone?

139
00:11:06.493 --> 00:11:09.192
Am I dropping to that low level?

140
00:11:09.393 --> 00:11:11.432
Is it that great to be old?

141
00:11:11.732 --> 00:11:12.932
I never said that.

142
00:11:12.932 --> 00:11:15.273
You can't control getting aged.

143
00:11:15.332 --> 00:11:17.173
I didn't ask you to help me. Gosh.

144
00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:40.363
Do you really not feel anything?

145
00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:52.273
How can you ask out a woman when you don't even know her name?

146
00:12:05.452 --> 00:12:08.092
- Jung Sun, you found her. - Are you okay, Hyun Soo?

147
00:12:08.822 --> 00:12:09.822
Yes.

148
00:12:12.393 --> 00:12:14.062
My name is On Jung Sun.

149
00:12:15.432 --> 00:12:16.533
What is your name?

150
00:12:19.163 --> 00:12:20.302
I'm going to refuse...

151
00:12:21.972 --> 00:12:23.072
the offer you made today.

152
00:12:29.643 --> 00:12:32.043
You're all wet. My gosh.

153
00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:48.533
Be confident.

154
00:12:49.863 --> 00:12:52.863
No one in this world deserves to criticize you.

155
00:13:04.442 --> 00:13:06.743
I'm so excited to be back in Korea. It's been so long since I last came.

156
00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:09.013
Don't you have a family here?

157
00:13:10.082 --> 00:13:11.222
I have a son.

158
00:13:12.322 --> 00:13:14.293
He's the only person who's always on my side.

159
00:13:39.582 --> 00:13:42.013
Hey. The halibut is really fresh today.

160
00:13:42.883 --> 00:13:43.883
What do you think?

161
00:13:45.383 --> 00:13:47.322
I like them. I'll take five.

162
00:13:47.322 --> 00:13:49.092
You always take just enough for one serving.

163
00:13:49.092 --> 00:13:50.123
I'm going to use them for today's lunch menu.

164
00:13:50.123 --> 00:13:52.263
Okay. Just a second.

165
00:13:52.523 --> 00:13:53.832
Your idea got picked.

166
00:13:54.432 --> 00:13:55.533
Thank you.

167
00:13:56.663 --> 00:13:59.462
I really like the scene where he gets murdered with climbing irons.

168
00:13:59.462 --> 00:14:01.033
I think it'll be a great scene.

169
00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:02.873
This is only a draft,

170
00:14:02.873 --> 00:14:04.543
so we're going to give it to the director after we edit it.

171
00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:07.143
I don't think it'll require much editing. It's fun already.

172
00:14:07.143 --> 00:14:08.373
It's really relieving.

173
00:14:08.513 --> 00:14:10.312
It's better because she succeeds in taking a cruel revenge.

174
00:14:10.312 --> 00:14:11.582
- It's very cathartic. - Yes.

175
00:14:16.082 --> 00:14:19.082
But she's the main character.

176
00:14:19.082 --> 00:14:20.153
So?

177
00:14:21.423 --> 00:14:23.092
I think it's a bit too brutal.

178
00:14:25.562 --> 00:14:28.533
The scene itself is fun, but I think it harms the character.

179
00:14:29.462 --> 00:14:32.332
The logic of "Become a monster to defeat a monster"...

180
00:14:32.332 --> 00:14:34.572
is popularly used in many movies and dramas these days.

181
00:14:34.572 --> 00:14:36.972
It just feels like we're only following the trend.

182
00:14:37.202 --> 00:14:39.302
- You're really good at... - This is why...

183
00:14:40.373 --> 00:14:42.243
you can't make it.

184
00:14:42.572 --> 00:14:44.913
We're not following the trend.

185
00:14:44.913 --> 00:14:46.783
We're just depicting human nature.

186
00:14:47.283 --> 00:14:49.352
And our drama's storyline is focused on that.

187
00:14:49.552 --> 00:14:51.783
But up until now, your writing was...

188
00:14:52.153 --> 00:14:56.293
based on a premise that human nature is fundamentally good.

189
00:14:56.623 --> 00:14:58.423
That means the main topic has changed.

190
00:14:58.663 --> 00:14:59.962
Why is the topic important?

191
00:15:00.163 --> 00:15:02.062
What's important is the main character.

192
00:15:02.763 --> 00:15:06.363
Must I teach an amateur like you every single thing...

193
00:15:06.363 --> 00:15:09.503
in the process of trying to finish my work?

194
00:15:11.773 --> 00:15:12.873
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:25.623
Is there anything new?

196
00:15:25.623 --> 00:15:28.423
We have a special menu today. Would you like to try it?

197
00:15:50.682 --> 00:15:52.643
Let me try it.

198
00:16:00.822 --> 00:16:02.393
It needs a bit more seasoning.

199
00:16:02.393 --> 00:16:05.293
I made it a bit bland on purpose to bring out the taste of halibut.

200
00:16:05.863 --> 00:16:08.092
It's for a VVIP customer. He almost always eats by himself.

201
00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.633
He doesn't want to get disturbed while eating.

202
00:16:09.732 --> 00:16:12.432
How strange. Food tastes better when you eat it with someone.

203
00:16:12.432 --> 00:16:14.533
Don't experiment with this dish. Just follow the norm.

204
00:16:14.602 --> 00:16:15.832
Please respect my way of cooking.

205
00:16:15.832 --> 00:16:19.143
I respect you, but I'm saying this because it's business.

206
00:16:19.342 --> 00:16:21.013
To me, it's not business.

207
00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:48.269
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E02 Temperature of Love "Will You Be My Girlfriend?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

208
00:17:06.153 --> 00:17:09.053
You don't need to pay today.

209
00:17:09.492 --> 00:17:10.492
Why not?

210
00:17:10.492 --> 00:17:12.022
You didn't even finish your meal.

211
00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:15.633
You must've not enjoyed it. Actually, I didn't cook it.

212
00:17:15.992 --> 00:17:17.532
I know it was cooked by a new chef.

213
00:17:18.032 --> 00:17:19.103
You knew?

214
00:17:19.502 --> 00:17:20.702
It tasted really nice.

215
00:17:21.232 --> 00:17:23.532
He did a good job in bringing out the taste of halibut.

216
00:17:23.732 --> 00:17:24.843
I enjoyed it.

217
00:17:25.202 --> 00:17:26.442
Then why did you...

218
00:17:28.272 --> 00:17:29.542
Because it hurt my pride.

219
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.113
I didn't like the fact that I was starting to eat like a pig.

220
00:17:35.083 --> 00:17:36.113
I'll tell him that.

221
00:17:36.113 --> 00:17:38.153
No, I'll tell him myself.

222
00:17:38.823 --> 00:17:41.053
I should be the one to compliment him on his cooking.

223
00:17:45.762 --> 00:17:49.492
Gosh, you're eating really well for someone who just got scolded.

224
00:17:49.492 --> 00:17:51.462
Getting scolded and eating are two very different things.

225
00:17:52.432 --> 00:17:54.073
You seem more approachable when you eat.

226
00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:58.272
I'm always approachable. You just don't like me that much.

227
00:17:58.643 --> 00:18:02.073
You don't look like a writer. You're pretty.

228
00:18:04.343 --> 00:18:05.643
- Hello? - Hey.

229
00:18:05.982 --> 00:18:08.282
Back in the day, people used to beat you up if you were pretty.

230
00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:10.153
At least we don't beat you up.

231
00:18:11.653 --> 00:18:13.792
What? Really?

232
00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:18.093
My gosh, thank you. I'll be waiting for your call.

233
00:18:20.762 --> 00:18:21.792
What's going on?

234
00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:24.563
Hey, I got nominated.

235
00:18:25.232 --> 00:18:27.373
My gosh, I can't believe this.

236
00:18:27.772 --> 00:18:30.472
- Congratulations! - I can't believe this.

237
00:18:30.472 --> 00:18:32.643
What's going on? Did something happen?

238
00:18:33.103 --> 00:18:35.343
Gi Da got nominated.

239
00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.212
My goodness.

240
00:18:37.542 --> 00:18:39.682
Congratulations. I'm so happy for you.

241
00:18:39.843 --> 00:18:41.982
Thank you. This is all thanks to you.

242
00:18:41.982 --> 00:18:44.583
No, it was all you. I knew you'd get nominated this time.

243
00:18:45.383 --> 00:18:46.452
Hyun Soo, didn't you get a call yet?

244
00:18:47.923 --> 00:18:48.952
No.

245
00:18:50.893 --> 00:18:52.863
Who's getting a call? What if someone got nominated again?

246
00:18:52.863 --> 00:18:54.492
- Hyun Soo, it's your phone. - Hyun Soo.

247
00:18:55.063 --> 00:18:56.732
- Hurry up, and pick up. - Okay.

248
00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:04.472
Why aren't you answering?

249
00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:09.972
It's my younger sister.

250
00:19:10.643 --> 00:19:12.542
Her hobby is to ruin my life.

251
00:19:17.452 --> 00:19:18.553
Congratulations.

252
00:19:18.752 --> 00:19:20.153
I'm so happy for you.

253
00:19:25.323 --> 00:19:26.663
I told you not to call me out like this.

254
00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.492
I have a favor to ask you.

255
00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:30.333
I asked Hyun Soo to come here.

256
00:19:30.932 --> 00:19:31.932
So?

257
00:19:32.563 --> 00:19:35.732
The results for SBC's Drama Writing Contest came out today.

258
00:19:35.732 --> 00:19:38.042
But she didn't get nominated, so I want to cheer her up.

259
00:19:40.403 --> 00:19:41.413
And?

260
00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:42.742
Please make something spicy.

261
00:19:43.012 --> 00:19:45.143
I couldn't see anything spicy on your menu. She likes spicy food.

262
00:19:45.782 --> 00:19:47.353
I think you're misunderstanding something.

263
00:19:47.613 --> 00:19:49.682
I'm an employee who works here.

264
00:19:49.752 --> 00:19:51.653
I don't have the right to do what I want in the kitchen.

265
00:20:02.563 --> 00:20:05.532
You can't just come in here like this. Who told you the passcode?

266
00:20:05.532 --> 00:20:06.633
Sung Eun did.

267
00:20:06.833 --> 00:20:08.803
Hey, I noticed Gi Da's work got nominated.

268
00:20:08.803 --> 00:20:09.903
- Did you know? - Move your feet.

269
00:20:10.272 --> 00:20:12.903
They all went to eat. I'm also going to go as soon as I'm done with this.

270
00:20:12.903 --> 00:20:14.913
Hey, you made it to the semi-finals.

271
00:20:15.442 --> 00:20:17.813
Show me your script. I'll tell you what you did wrong.

272
00:20:17.813 --> 00:20:19.682
Then you'll be able to do better on the next contest.

273
00:20:19.883 --> 00:20:21.782
Just focus on taking care of your own career.

274
00:20:22.583 --> 00:20:24.383
My gosh, you're so aggressive.

275
00:20:24.853 --> 00:20:26.553
You must be really upset about not getting nominated.

276
00:20:28.752 --> 00:20:29.792
Don't worry.

277
00:20:30.153 --> 00:20:33.262
Let me see. Abracadabra.

278
00:20:33.663 --> 00:20:34.992
I see someone special in your near future.

279
00:20:35.762 --> 00:20:37.032
What are you talking about?

280
00:20:44.272 --> 00:20:47.942
- Thank you. - You're so polite.

281
00:20:48.673 --> 00:20:51.212
I learned that I need to be polite to succeed in life.

282
00:20:52.883 --> 00:20:54.413
You're going to make a debut as a director soon.

283
00:20:54.413 --> 00:20:56.752
You should also practice being polite.

284
00:20:56.752 --> 00:20:59.053
You should just worry about your own debut as a writer.

285
00:20:59.053 --> 00:21:00.923
You'll be able to make a living as soon as you make a debut.

286
00:21:00.923 --> 00:21:02.792
You can just write absentmindedly after your first piece of work.

287
00:21:02.792 --> 00:21:04.492
You're giving me such a great lesson.

288
00:21:04.492 --> 00:21:07.232
It's a fact. Writers these days earn money so easily.

289
00:21:07.462 --> 00:21:08.792
They'll write any kind of lowly drama for money.

290
00:21:08.792 --> 00:21:10.333
Writers aren't the only ones who make dramas.

291
00:21:10.633 --> 00:21:13.303
Writers and directors work together to make whatever drama they make.

292
00:21:14.032 --> 00:21:15.633
Does a drama need to have a certain genre for it to be classy?

293
00:21:15.633 --> 00:21:17.843
Does it need to deal with social corruption for it to be elegant?

294
00:21:18.002 --> 00:21:21.012
I don't think you deserve to say that.

295
00:21:21.442 --> 00:21:22.712
You can't write melodramas.

296
00:21:23.573 --> 00:21:25.643
That's why I'm having trouble debuting.

297
00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:29.782
I've failed to read the trend that's been coming down for decades.

298
00:21:30.113 --> 00:21:32.282
I've never been so disregarded in my life.

299
00:21:33.282 --> 00:21:35.823
I'm sorry, Jung Woo. We tend to be like this whenever we meet.

300
00:21:36.853 --> 00:21:39.393
You make it sound as if we're really close.

301
00:21:39.692 --> 00:21:41.163
You must like to be precise.

302
00:21:42.163 --> 00:21:43.192
Yes.

303
00:21:43.192 --> 00:21:44.702
Then you must like accuracy too.

304
00:21:45.202 --> 00:21:46.202
Yes.

305
00:21:47.803 --> 00:21:49.633
You should work with us. No.

306
00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:51.702
You should work with me.

307
00:21:52.242 --> 00:21:53.242
Why?

308
00:21:53.242 --> 00:21:55.272
What do you mean? You should accept it right away.

309
00:21:55.542 --> 00:21:57.512
You're just an assistant writer. You shouldn't be like this.

310
00:21:57.512 --> 00:21:58.813
Just because I'm an assistant writer,

311
00:21:58.813 --> 00:22:01.053
it doesn't mean I should accept any offer that comes my way.

312
00:22:04.982 --> 00:22:06.182
I have a previous engagement.

313
00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:11.823
It was nice meeting you.

314
00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:15.833
I'm sorry. I don't feel comfortable enough to shake your hand.

315
00:22:20.232 --> 00:22:21.333
Hey, wait.

316
00:22:26.272 --> 00:22:27.442
Jung Woo, I'm sorry.

317
00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.613
She'll become a writer.

318
00:22:30.173 --> 00:22:31.343
She's rude enough to be one.

319
00:22:37.883 --> 00:22:39.423
Hyun Soo, you're here.

320
00:22:41.423 --> 00:22:42.752
It's nice here.

321
00:22:42.952 --> 00:22:45.363
This is the most popular place in Hongdae.

322
00:22:47.492 --> 00:22:48.492
What would you like?

323
00:22:49.292 --> 00:22:50.532
(Main Dishes, Cod with cheese sauce, 29 dollars,)

324
00:22:50.532 --> 00:22:51.732
(lobster, 48 dollars, beef steak 55 dollars)

325
00:22:52.603 --> 00:22:54.173
It's too expensive.

326
00:22:54.333 --> 00:22:55.702
They're French dishes.

327
00:22:55.702 --> 00:22:57.803
You're a writer. You should try food like this.

328
00:22:58.403 --> 00:22:59.873
You ate something, right?

329
00:22:59.873 --> 00:23:01.042
I ate salad.

330
00:23:02.113 --> 00:23:05.383
Then let's leave now. I'll treat you when I win the contest.

331
00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:08.452
Hyun Soo, my parents are rich. Have you forgotten that?

332
00:23:08.952 --> 00:23:10.923
How could I ever forget that?

333
00:23:11.522 --> 00:23:15.053
Anyway, I want to eat here when I can afford to treat you.

334
00:23:17.462 --> 00:23:19.992
Where are we going? I'll tell Jung Sun to join us.

335
00:23:20.323 --> 00:23:21.333
Get your bag.

336
00:23:26.732 --> 00:23:29.932
Years go by

337
00:23:30.772 --> 00:23:32.143
Come out now.

338
00:23:32.472 --> 00:23:33.542
Or I'll go home.

339
00:23:34.272 --> 00:23:35.373
Okay.

340
00:23:38.643 --> 00:23:40.782
It feels so good now that I ate spicy food.

341
00:23:41.452 --> 00:23:42.782
My head feels clear.

342
00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:46.583
Why isn't Jung Sun coming?

343
00:23:46.853 --> 00:23:50.153
Let's go now. Some guy has been waiting for you.

344
00:23:50.522 --> 00:23:52.063
I'm sorry, Hyun Soo.

345
00:23:52.123 --> 00:23:56.093
My plan was to drink with you all night long.

346
00:23:56.563 --> 00:23:57.633
Cheers.

347
00:24:03.133 --> 00:24:04.472
How much is it?

348
00:24:04.472 --> 00:24:06.542
- No way. I'll pay. - It's 30 dollars.

349
00:24:07.643 --> 00:24:09.212
Here you go. Keep the change.

350
00:24:11.742 --> 00:24:14.182
- Are you going home? - You're here.

351
00:24:17.252 --> 00:24:19.182
Hyun Soo, where are you going?

352
00:24:19.182 --> 00:24:20.952
You should go this way.

353
00:24:21.022 --> 00:24:22.022
Isn't it that way?

354
00:24:22.393 --> 00:24:23.553
No, it's this way.

355
00:24:23.893 --> 00:24:25.292
She's terrible with directions.

356
00:24:29.663 --> 00:24:32.063
Guys, I'll get going now.

357
00:24:32.063 --> 00:24:33.563
- Hyun Soo, see you later. - Okay.

358
00:24:33.563 --> 00:24:34.873
Jung Sun, see you later.

359
00:24:36.002 --> 00:24:37.403
- See you. - Bye.

360
00:24:44.113 --> 00:24:45.182
Goodbye.

361
00:24:50.752 --> 00:24:52.022
Where do you live?

362
00:24:52.022 --> 00:24:53.053
Why do you ask?

363
00:24:53.353 --> 00:24:56.252
Don't be afraid. I won't ask you to be my girlfriend again.

364
00:24:56.252 --> 00:24:57.893
Who's afraid?

365
00:24:58.563 --> 00:24:59.863
How do you go home from here?

366
00:25:03.462 --> 00:25:06.903
Let me see. I'm at Yeouido,

367
00:25:07.002 --> 00:25:10.573
and I live in Yeonnam-dong.

368
00:25:11.702 --> 00:25:13.772
I need to take a bus over there.

369
00:25:14.173 --> 00:25:16.643
You have to take a bus over here to go to Yeonnam-dong.

370
00:25:17.542 --> 00:25:20.613
You're wrong. That direction is right.

371
00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:24.883
I may be bad with directions, but I've been coming here for years.

372
00:25:25.252 --> 00:25:26.982
Do you think I don't even know how to go home from here?

373
00:25:33.462 --> 00:25:34.992
(Yeonnam-dong, Yeouido Station)

374
00:25:40.673 --> 00:25:42.333
I also live in Yeonnam-dong.

375
00:25:47.113 --> 00:25:48.472
I'm sorry.

376
00:25:54.482 --> 00:25:57.053
I always have to see something through in my way.

377
00:26:00.282 --> 00:26:01.952
That's the same for me.

378
00:26:05.522 --> 00:26:07.163
My name is Lee Hyun Soo.

379
00:26:07.893 --> 00:26:09.432
It sounds like a boy's name, right?

380
00:26:09.732 --> 00:26:11.303
I'm On Jung Sun.

381
00:26:11.833 --> 00:26:13.103
It sounds like a girl's name, right?

382
00:26:13.903 --> 00:26:15.932
You told me your name before.

383
00:26:16.432 --> 00:26:17.472
I know.

384
00:26:18.803 --> 00:26:21.173
But this is a new start.

385
00:26:21.712 --> 00:26:23.782
I guess you can get over someone quite easily.

386
00:26:23.913 --> 00:26:26.843
If I don't, I can't move on.

387
00:26:31.182 --> 00:26:33.423
When I quit my job,

388
00:26:35.153 --> 00:26:37.593
I thought I would become a writer quickly.

389
00:26:39.663 --> 00:26:41.333
I underestimated life.

390
00:26:42.262 --> 00:26:45.032
I had never failed any tests.

391
00:26:55.942 --> 00:26:57.913
I love Yeouido.

392
00:27:00.913 --> 00:27:03.053
I said that I will dance in Yeouido Park...

393
00:27:03.682 --> 00:27:06.282
when I win the screenwriting contest.

394
00:27:08.292 --> 00:27:10.323
However, I don't think I'll have a chance to do that.

395
00:27:18.833 --> 00:27:20.633
I feel like I'm a garden tiger moth...

396
00:27:21.333 --> 00:27:24.702
that flies into fire knowing it could die.

397
00:27:26.673 --> 00:27:27.813
Despite that feeling,

398
00:27:30.883 --> 00:27:32.083
even if I die,

399
00:27:35.212 --> 00:27:37.482
I still want to go into the fire.

400
00:27:54.732 --> 00:27:56.173
What are you doing?

401
00:27:56.972 --> 00:27:58.343
What do you think I'll do?

402
00:28:01.742 --> 00:28:05.083
Since you haven't called me, I thought you couldn't find him.

403
00:28:05.482 --> 00:28:08.313
You found his bank details. You made a progress.

404
00:28:09.252 --> 00:28:10.623
Please speed things up.

405
00:28:11.482 --> 00:28:13.653
I miss my son.

406
00:28:32.143 --> 00:28:33.303
Why did you take me here?

407
00:28:34.272 --> 00:28:37.413
Practice the dance you'll do when you win the contest.

408
00:28:38.843 --> 00:28:40.383
You must be out of your mind.

409
00:29:10.073 --> 00:29:11.942
(We thank Jang Hyun Sung for his guest appearance.)

410
00:29:11.942 --> 00:29:13.042
("You Are" by Seung Hee of Oh My Girl)

411
00:29:21.452 --> 00:29:23.722
(Temperature of Love)

412
00:29:24.492 --> 00:29:25.492
Let's eat together.

413
00:29:25.492 --> 00:29:27.163
Are we going all the way to Beolgyo to eat cockles?

414
00:29:27.163 --> 00:29:29.163
How can you take a day off while the drama is in season?

415
00:29:29.163 --> 00:29:31.432
For the past 10 years, I've never seen anyone so evil like you.

416
00:29:31.432 --> 00:29:32.702
Hey, give Hyun Soo her stuff.

417
00:29:32.702 --> 00:29:35.073
I meant to accept it, but this is too much.

418
00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:36.502
I feel like it's not enough.

419
00:29:36.603 --> 00:29:38.202
- Give me money. - Get out of my house.

420
00:29:38.202 --> 00:29:40.813
What kind of wench is she? Who made you like this?

421
00:29:40.813 --> 00:29:42.242
I'd like to kiss you.
