00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.611
Mad Dog.

2
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.920
Give it to me.

3
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.891
Where did you learn to bluff?

4
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.231
How do you know if I'm bluffing?

5
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.400
Do you want to bet?

6
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.801
Let's bet the most precious thing in life.

7
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.441
Something you can't change even if you die.

8
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:38.670
Something you can't throw out even if you die.

9
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.210
Something you can't erase even if you die.

10
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.551
What's that?

11
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.810
Family.

12
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:47.420
This time, let's bet our family.

13
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:55.091
(Mad Dog, Episode 2, Family)

14
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:58.761
(2 years ago, October 10, 2015)

15
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.131
It's not a big deal to travel to Jeju Island.

16
00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:02.761
It's nothing to get shoes for.

17
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.131
You're right. It's nothing much...

18
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.531
to finally take a family trip.

19
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:09.040
I should just wear my old shoes, right?

20
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.540
Do you have to say it like that?

21
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.070
Why don't you try these on?

22
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.911
Hey, try them on.

23
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:17.650
Goodness, isn't this something?

24
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.010
I found these awesome shoes.

25
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.221
I really want them.

26
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.650
Ju Won, what's your size?

27
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:25.221
- 230mm. - Okay.

28
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.221
These are 230mm too.

29
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:29.021
He won't be able to wear them for long.

30
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.661
We'll take them in 240mm.

31
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.631
It'll be fine.

32
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:36.301
Mom, please?

33
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:38.100
We only have those in 230mm.

34
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.730
These are very popular.

35
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.171
It's all right, Mi Sook.

36
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:43.400
It's okay.

37
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.811
We'll take one in 230mm.

38
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:46.471
He'll grow out of them in three months.

39
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.441
We'll get them next time.

40
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.411
It'll take forever for my feet to be 240mm big.

41
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.921
Dad, can you get them for me?

42
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.450
Ju Won.

43
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:00.691
You'll be a big boy very soon.

44
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.960
Have I ever lied to you?

45
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:04.460
You just close your eyes,

46
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.191
get a few night's sleep, and you'll be huge.

47
00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:08.961
Goodness, I don't believe you.

48
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:12.170
- Hey, Ju Won. - Choi Ju Won.

49
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.040
Get back here.

50
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:17.871
(Assistant Manager Park Moo Shin)

51
00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:20.381
I'm going after a criminal right now.

52
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:22.040
Will you let me stay here for a bit?

53
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.211
Can't you see?

54
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.681
You aren't supposed to park here.

55
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.550
Are you a cop?

56
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:28.681
What's your affiliation?

57
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.191
Oh, I'm not exactly a police officer.

58
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:32.191
What?

59
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.920
I'm a claims examiner of Taeyang Insurance.

60
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.931
Goodness, sir.

61
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:40.091
- Keep up the good work. - Who are you?

62
00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:41.200
Have some.

63
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.100
Will you give him your license already?

64
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.830
He owes 40 dollars as the fine, right?

65
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.941
- Yes. - Okay.

66
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.540
Hey, get out of the car.

67
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.741
Give it to him with two hands. Be respectful.

68
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.811
I don't believe you. My goodness.

69
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:55.580
Oh, he doesn't have to...

70
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.751
I am truly sorry.

71
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.181
I won't let you off next time.

72
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.580
- Of course. - Move the car.

73
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.820
Of course. Hey, move your car.

74
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.920
And take this.

75
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.751
Oh, you could have this.

76
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.020
Thank you.

77
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.091
Keep up the good work.

78
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.401
The weather is so nice.

79
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.600
I thought you were taking a vacation.

80
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.501
Weren't you, Manager Choi?

81
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.100
Don't call me Manager Choi.

82
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.570
It's just you and me here.

83
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.670
Goodness.

84
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.911
I've been telling the new kid...

85
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.781
to not tell people he's a claims examiner,

86
00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:32.110
and to never tail people, but he just got out.

87
00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:37.020
Why must I look after a new kid like him...

88
00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:39.520
as the assistant manager of Taeyang Insurance?

89
00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:42.920
Yes, a claims examiner of Taeyang Insurance.

90
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.091
That sounds very fancy.

91
00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:47.561
"Claims" makes it sound like there's some action,

92
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.501
and "examiner" sounds like we're detectives of sort.

93
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.040
They'd love to go after the wicked...

94
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.841
like Sherlock Holmes or Arsene Lupin,

95
00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:59.911
breaking every single part of our beloved law.

96
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.741
I mean them, the new kids.

97
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.311
Look at him. He's running to us.

98
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.350
Moo Shin.

99
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.790
What do you think managers and assistant managers do?

100
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.790
Do we have our posts to be treated like kings?

101
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.961
We're there to teach...

102
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:17.960
the new kids into becoming a presentable examiner.

103
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.260
That's what I believe,

104
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.900
Assistant Manager Park Moo Shin.

105
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:23.601
Sorry.

106
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:26.530
I mean, I apologize, Manager Choi.

107
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.770
Don't be sorry.

108
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.470
I made sure the car is at a parking lot.

109
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.970
A car must be parked at a parking lot,

110
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.080
and an examiner must stay within the law, okay?

111
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.241
Okay.

112
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.780
Hey, let's take a picture.

113
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.621
- Take one for us. - Pardon?

114
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:43.351
- Hurry! Take one. - Okay.

115
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:45.590
It's all about the timing.

116
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.590
In 1, 2, 3.

117
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.530
Say cheese.

118
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.900
Ko Jin Chul. 27 years old.

119
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.030
He has three life insurance coverages.

120
00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.671
Including accident treaty...

121
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:01.941
600,000 dollars is set as maximum claim.

122
00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:03.770
There seems to be no problem...

123
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.111
with the insurance he has.

124
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:08.140
Then why did we see him?

125
00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:09.981
You told the police he was a criminal.

126
00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:11.010
Why?

127
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:14.150
It's because the assistant manager...

128
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.751
said let's go get the bad guys today.

129
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:19.351
Hey, look closely.

130
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.760
What do the contracts have in common?

131
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.991
Ko Jin Chul didn't apply for this one.

132
00:05:25.231 --> 00:05:27.501
All of them were applied by different people.

133
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.631
Han Soo Jung, Kang Mi Ri,

134
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.871
Oh Min Hwa.

135
00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:35.070
Ko Jin Chul is their beneficiary.

136
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.941
Han Soo Jung died in July of 2012...

137
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:41.280
in a car accident.

138
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.681
Ko Jin Chul received...

139
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:44.251
100,000 dollars in death benefit.

140
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.080
Kang Mi Ri died in June of 2014...

141
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.080
in a car accident instantly.

142
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.150
With an accident treaty, Ko Jin Chul received...

143
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.260
220,000 dollars in death benefit.

144
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.131
Oh Min Ah died in a hospital after...

145
00:05:57.131 --> 00:05:58.731
a car accident in February of 2015.

146
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:01.731
Including hospital fees, 350,000 dollars was paid.

147
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:03.731
He used the same method three times.

148
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.601
Is this possible?

149
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.941
We screen the subscribers' names first...

150
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:09.241
for insurance fraud,

151
00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:11.671
not the beneficiaries' names.

152
00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:12.941
It's easy to spot scammers...

153
00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:15.140
who apply for multiple insurances.

154
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.910
When it's different subscribers...

155
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.650
with non-family beneficiaries,

156
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.551
it's difficult to notice.

157
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:23.080
He's evolving.

158
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.291
The claim is increasing, and time is shortening.

159
00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:27.660
Then that woman is in danger.

160
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.231
There's a high chance she'll be the next to go.

161
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:32.390
Then we should report him right away.

162
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.231
The police won't investigate...

163
00:06:34.231 --> 00:06:36.200
a case that didn't even happen yet.

164
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.931
We can report...

165
00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.700
all the previous cases too.

166
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.900
The vehicles were scrapped,

167
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.140
and the bodies were cremated.

168
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.570
They won't re-investigate without proof.

169
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.140
Then we should go warn her at least.

170
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:48.780
Your fiance will kill you.

171
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.611
Would you trust...

172
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:54.020
your fiance who promised eternal love...

173
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.450
or a claims examiner you've never seen?

174
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.890
We can't just sit and watch.

175
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.650
That wouldn't be right.

176
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.291
I compared the ladies' applications...

177
00:07:01.291 --> 00:07:03.530
with Ko Jin Chul's application.

178
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.260
Take a look at the ladies' application dates.

179
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.361
That's Ko Jin Chul's file for claims.

180
00:07:09.631 --> 00:07:11.270
Victim Ko Jin Chul. Beneficiary Han Soo Jung.

181
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.470
Yes. He was in a car accident...

182
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.101
that resulted in a three-week injury.

183
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.470
Han Soo Jung received 2,300 dollars.

184
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.510
When's the payment date?

185
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.710
It's April 30, 2012.

186
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.851
It's the same with Kang Mi Ri and Oh Min Hwa.

187
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.551
First, he put them...

188
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:28.921
as beneficiaries and applied for insurance.

189
00:07:28.921 --> 00:07:30.020
He got into an accident,

190
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.691
then he filed for claims.

191
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:34.061
He led by example.

192
00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:35.791
He led by example?

193
00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:38.061
So he subscribed to a coverage first...

194
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:39.861
with the woman as a beneficiary.

195
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:41.861
He somehow got into an accident,

196
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.530
claimed the insurance money,

197
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.501
and gave it all to her.

198
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.041
She'll think "He loves me so much."

199
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.941
Love is something you can't see,

200
00:07:50.941 --> 00:07:53.941
but you can see his injuries and money.

201
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.510
She'll want to pay him back for his love.

202
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.650
(Beneficiary Ko Jin Chul)

203
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.650
Is there any new insurance under her name?

204
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.150
No, there isn't.

205
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.720
I checked with Financial Supervisory System.

206
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.220
There is none in other companies as well.

207
00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.191
Maybe...

208
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:08.491
this time, he's really in love...

209
00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:10.561
Insurance scammers...

210
00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:12.330
don't stop after one gig.

211
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:16.601
All right, so what do we need to do?

212
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.030
Investigation?

213
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:19.770
Yes, investigation.

214
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.171
Investigate what?

215
00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:24.811
We have to find proof from previous cases.

216
00:08:24.811 --> 00:08:27.041
But the vehicles and bodies are gone.

217
00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:28.981
You must abide by the law.

218
00:08:28.981 --> 00:08:30.881
No trespassing or wiretapping.

219
00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:33.650
How can we catch the criminal then?

220
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.381
That's why you have to work hard, you punk.

221
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.520
Notify me as soon as...

222
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.260
he applies for insurance with her as beneficiary.

223
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.290
Because that's a sign.

224
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.420
Yes, sir.

225
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.591
What is it?

226
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.361
There was only one insurance planner...

227
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.170
that dealt with Ko Jin Chul.

228
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.501
She won the best planner a few years ago.

229
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.601
It's Lee Mi Ran.

230
00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:58.510
What is it? Is the planner his accomplice?

231
00:09:00.381 --> 00:09:02.440
No, Ms. Lee can't be.

232
00:09:02.841 --> 00:09:05.451
She's a hard worker, and she's really friendly.

233
00:09:05.981 --> 00:09:08.451
My wife got insurance through her as well.

234
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.190
I mean it's not an organized crime.

235
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.420
Why would a planner get involved?

236
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:14.890
I know,

237
00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.131
but this doesn't feel right, Mr. Choi.

238
00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:20.060
Okay, I'll look into it.

239
00:09:20.201 --> 00:09:22.101
Let's focus on Ko Jin Chul first.

240
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.461
We have to stop the next case.

241
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:24.631
- Okay. - Okay.

242
00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:27.001
(Oh Min Hwa)

243
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:28.270
(Died instantly in a car accident)

244
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.371
Hey.

245
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:31.910
Be careful, okay?

246
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.341
- Okay. - Okay!

247
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:35.940
Newbie. Let's go.

248
00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:43.251
Please come to the 20th floor.

249
00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:44.890
Gosh, he got me.

250
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.890
You shouldn't have come to work on your vacation.

251
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.060
I know.

252
00:09:48.861 --> 00:09:50.331
(Lee Mi Ran)

253
00:09:50.331 --> 00:09:51.760
(Taeyang Insurance Planner)

254
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.871
Why didn't you go to Jeju Island?

255
00:09:58.371 --> 00:09:59.731
My flight is at night.

256
00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:02.601
What about you? Why are you here?

257
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.670
My flight is tomorrow.

258
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.851
Take this and go home.

259
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.251
Chairman Cha.

260
00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:15.951
What? Is this old fashioned?

261
00:10:15.951 --> 00:10:18.190
I already got a bonus for Chuseok.

262
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.991
This is for Mi Sook.

263
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.621
I hear education costs a lot these days.

264
00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:26.060
I know your family is short on money.

265
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:28.461
Take your family out for a nice meal.

266
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.831
Chairman Cha... I...

267
00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:32.530
Thank you, but I won't take the money.

268
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.040
Stop kidding me.

269
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.601
Come on. Just take it.

270
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.140
My arm hurts.

271
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.910
Sir, I really shouldn't take this.

272
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:45.180
Thank you, sir.

273
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:47.050
Go.

274
00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:55.920
He looks like a crook.

275
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.530
Ko Jin Chul.

276
00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:00.300
He's suspicious.

277
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.001
But the car was already scrapped,

278
00:11:02.001 --> 00:11:03.131
and the body was cremated.

279
00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:05.170
What? There's no proof.

280
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.331
What do you want me to do?

281
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:07.601
What if there's an accomplice?

282
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.940
Have you ever seen an insurance fraud...

283
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.810
that was done perfectly from the start?

284
00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:15.440
It's hard for first offenders.

285
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.640
Then...

286
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:18.881
Is there a possibility of an accomplice?

287
00:11:21.721 --> 00:11:23.081
How is Hwan?

288
00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:28.591
Well... He gets better after kidney dialysis.

289
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.690
My wife is the one who must be tired.

290
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.631
Be nice to her.

291
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.530
You be nice to your wife.

292
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.331
I'm sorry and thank you.

293
00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:40.101
- For what? - For investigating hard.

294
00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:41.800
- Who? Me? - I'll call you.

295
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.611
Hey. Hey!

296
00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:52.751
(Three-month pregnant at the time of death)

297
00:11:52.751 --> 00:11:54.081
(350,000 dollars paid to Ko Jin Chul)

298
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.071
Check the name of the insured, Ju Won.

299
00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:18.940
- Okay. - Check your name here.

300
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.241
Then I just need to sign...

301
00:12:20.241 --> 00:12:22.211
- I'm home. - Goodness.

302
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:23.241
Honey.

303
00:12:23.241 --> 00:12:24.581
Yes.

304
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.280
Hi, Manager Choi.

305
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.221
(Shoes)

306
00:12:30.991 --> 00:12:32.451
Planner Lee Mi Ran.

307
00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:33.721
I didn't think you could come home tonight,

308
00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:34.760
but you're home early.

309
00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:36.621
I told you I'd be back soon.

310
00:12:36.621 --> 00:12:38.260
I'm a bit short this month,

311
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.890
so I asked her for help.

312
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.731
Taeyang Insurance family should help each other.

313
00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:43.800
Aren't I right, honey?

314
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.501
Sure. That's right.

315
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.701
Mi Ran.

316
00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:49.501
Was there...

317
00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:50.571
Pardon?

318
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.871
Excuse me.

319
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:56.280
Yes?

320
00:12:57.451 --> 00:12:58.451
Mr. Choi.

321
00:12:58.451 --> 00:13:00.481
I think the newbie is in big trouble.

322
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.180
- What? - He's after...

323
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.721
Ko Jin Chul and the woman.

324
00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:07.290
Did he apply for insurance?

325
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.190
Nothing in the database yet.

326
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.591
Okay. Hold on.

327
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.160
Mi Ran.

328
00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:18.231
Was there a new subscription today?

329
00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:19.631
No.

330
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.001
Are you sure?

331
00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:23.670
Didn't Ko Jin Chul apply for one today?

332
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.711
No.

333
00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:27.310
What are you doing, honey?

334
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.251
Hold on a second.

335
00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:34.550
Yes.

336
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.550
Why is he after them?

337
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.251
I don't know. He texted me he's going to Maseok.

338
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.690
He's not picking up.

339
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.361
Okay.

340
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.101
Give me the location, and keep calling him.

341
00:13:47.101 --> 00:13:49.030
Gosh, that punk.

342
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:51.670
What? Is Manager Choi on his way?

343
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.400
Isn't he overreacting?

344
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.170
The newbie wouldn't do anything.

345
00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:57.440
Was Manager Choi ever wrong?

346
00:13:57.711 --> 00:13:58.741
Stop the car.

347
00:13:58.741 --> 00:13:59.940
Can't you see?

348
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.810
It's like we're already parked.

349
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:03.951
Get off.

350
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.881
What's wrong with her?

351
00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:25.501
Here we go.

352
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.140
(Maseok Service Station)

353
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.961
(Mr. Choi Kang Woo)

354
00:15:27.331 --> 00:15:28.601
Hello?

355
00:15:28.601 --> 00:15:29.601
Where are you?

356
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:32.770
I pulled over on the route 46 headed to Gapyeong.

357
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.201
Do you really have to do this?

358
00:15:35.341 --> 00:15:36.770
I'm sorry, sir.

359
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.440
But...

360
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.581
about the third victim, Oh Min Hwa.

361
00:15:41.741 --> 00:15:44.611
She was three months pregnant when it happened.

362
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:48.481
I mean, she had his baby in her belly.

363
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:51.491
Sir, I can't stand this.

364
00:15:51.491 --> 00:15:53.420
Don't do anything.

365
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.461
Sir.

366
00:15:54.461 --> 00:15:55.461
Just follow him behind.

367
00:15:55.461 --> 00:15:57.190
- Keep the distance. - Pardon?

368
00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.390
You think you're on this alone?

369
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.800
Why do you try to move individually?

370
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.530
We're on our way too.

371
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.030
Do just one thing.

372
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.501
Be careful.

373
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:09.741
- Okay? - Okay.

374
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:44.071
(Your life insurance contract is complete.)

375
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.810
I got the text already, so why would you call me?

376
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.150
Is that right?

377
00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.920
Why would they work on a holiday like today?

378
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.791
Don't worry. Things will work out fine.

379
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.000
Rest for a while.

380
00:17:09.101 --> 00:17:10.101
Honey.

381
00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:13.371
Is there something going on?

382
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.500
No. You want to drink this?

383
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.240
Thanks. Did you drink something too?

384
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.571
Yes, I did.

385
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.291
The sun is high up

386
00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:38.291
Wake up

387
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.531
- What? - What?

388
00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:43.730
It's nothing. Go back to sleep.

389
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.531
Sleep tight.

390
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.410
(Mr. Park Moo Shin)

391
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.621
Darn it.

392
00:18:11.061 --> 00:18:14.200
Goodness, this punk. Answer your phone.

393
00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:16.730
Gosh.

394
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.740
Goodness! Drive slowly.

395
00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.940
Keep calling him.

396
00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.480
Goodness. These brats...

397
00:18:29.381 --> 00:18:31.210
I mean, well... Gosh.

398
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.551
(Mr. Park Moo Shin)

399
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:39.990
(Mr. Park Moo Shin)

400
00:18:41.261 --> 00:18:43.591
- Hello? - Hey, punk!

401
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:45.390
Why didn't you answer your calls? Where are you?

402
00:18:46.331 --> 00:18:48.831
I'm at...

403
00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.121
Hello?

404
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.450
Hello? Hey, newbie!

405
00:19:22.101 --> 00:19:24.271
- Ms. Jang. - Call an ambulance now.

406
00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:25.271
Okay.

407
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.611
Jae Soo. Park Jae Soo!

408
00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:38.410
Jae Soo.

409
00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.051
Jae Soo. Park Jae Soo!

410
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.621
Jae Soo.

411
00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:47.990
Hurry!

412
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:52.460
Which hospital is it?

413
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.660
Which hospital is it?

414
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.400
What were you guys doing?

415
00:20:07.111 --> 00:20:08.740
(Operations Schedule)

416
00:20:10.081 --> 00:20:12.811
(Park Jae Soo)

417
00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:17.250
(Operating Room)

418
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.690
The newbie's last name was Park?

419
00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:21.920
He's the 38th descendant of the Miryang Park.

420
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:23.990
You're the 40th descendant, right?

421
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.291
He said he was like your grandpa.

422
00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:27.801
That's right.

423
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.900
He's the earlier descendant than me.

424
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.571
- Hey, Moo Shin. - Yes?

425
00:20:32.571 --> 00:20:33.740
Call him by his name.

426
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.341
Don't call him "newbie".

427
00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.541
Did he tell you about this?

428
00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:42.980
I mean, why would he tell him about this and not me?

429
00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:44.051
He should've told me too.

430
00:20:44.051 --> 00:20:45.051
Honey.

431
00:20:46.611 --> 00:20:47.881
Honey!

432
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.791
Are you okay?

433
00:20:54.561 --> 00:20:55.720
Jae Soo...

434
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.990
Has it been long since he went into operation?

435
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.430
What?

436
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.430
She was three months pregnant when it happened.

437
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.900
I mean, she had his baby in her belly.

438
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.410
He said he wasn't married.

439
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.011
Why that punk...

440
00:21:21.581 --> 00:21:22.680
(Operating Room)

441
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.101
Honey, I'm fine even if we don't go on a trip.

442
00:21:35.101 --> 00:21:37.601
Don't worry, and get your work done.

443
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.311
- Thank you. - Thank you.

444
00:21:50.581 --> 00:21:52.011
Thank you.

445
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.220
Thank you.

446
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.690
Have a seat.

447
00:22:08.301 --> 00:22:09.361
Are you okay?

448
00:22:10.531 --> 00:22:11.801
Thank you.

449
00:22:12.601 --> 00:22:13.771
You must've been startled.

450
00:22:21.111 --> 00:22:23.710
Chairman Cha. I'm sorry to call you this early.

451
00:22:24.381 --> 00:22:25.450
We'll have to see how he recovers,

452
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.121
but his surgery went successfully.

453
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:28.650
Okay.

454
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:30.690
That's enough.

455
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.791
Chairman Cha.

456
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.351
It's all my fault.

457
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.021
Get some rest.

458
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:49.101
Hong Joo.

459
00:23:00.081 --> 00:23:01.551
Mr. Choi.

460
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.420
Jae Soo.

461
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.521
You didn't...

462
00:23:07.861 --> 00:23:09.390
go to Jeju Island?

463
00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.791
You punk.

464
00:23:12.531 --> 00:23:14.101
You should go now,

465
00:23:15.031 --> 00:23:17.301
so that I get scolded later too.

466
00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240
Hey.

467
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.071
Let me punch you just once.

468
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.541
Goodness.

469
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:32.480
Thanks.

470
00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:35.521
Gosh.

471
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.750
Do I have to pay off the hospital fee right now?

472
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:50.900
Please cover the bill with this.

473
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.900
Okay.

474
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.571
Mr. Choi.

475
00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:00.781
Well...

476
00:24:03.551 --> 00:24:05.250
Your baby shouldn't starve.

477
00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.250
Make sure you eat your meals.

478
00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:10.791
Thank you.

479
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:21.631
Things will be complicated if they find out...

480
00:24:21.631 --> 00:24:23.160
he's from our company.

481
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.430
It'll be fine.

482
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.500
He demanded 100,000 dollars,

483
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.900
so I settled it with 200, 000 dollars.

484
00:24:27.801 --> 00:24:30.071
Director Cha, I'm sorry.

485
00:24:30.071 --> 00:24:31.311
I'll take full responsibility.

486
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:34.081
We'll take our hands off Ko Jin Chul from now on.

487
00:24:34.081 --> 00:24:35.081
Director Cha.

488
00:24:35.611 --> 00:24:36.881
We can't do that.

489
00:24:37.111 --> 00:24:38.511
Ko Jin Chul...

490
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:40.750
knew Jae Soo was after him, so he used him.

491
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.021
Shall I make him write a resignation letter...

492
00:24:43.021 --> 00:24:44.650
and charge you for 200,000 dollars...

493
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.990
that we wasted on the settlement?

494
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.261
- Director Cha. - We decided to let it go.

495
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:49.361
My dad...

496
00:24:51.131 --> 00:24:53.091
I mean it's the chairman's decision.

497
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.561
It's all for the better.

498
00:24:56.601 --> 00:24:58.670
I'll visit him and talk to him myself.

499
00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:02.841
My dad left for Jeju Island yesterday.

500
00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:05.710
Oh, you can meet him when you get there.

501
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:07.611
What time is your flight?

502
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:09.381
Did your wife and Ju Won leave already?

503
00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:11.710
Director Cha.

504
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.480
I thought Mr. Park's life isn't in danger,

505
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.321
and that he's okay enough to talk.

506
00:25:15.351 --> 00:25:16.950
He'll receive treatments once he gets to Seoul.

507
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:17.950
Don't worry.

508
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.291
How can I go to Jeju Island...

509
00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:22.621
as the manager in this situation?

510
00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:24.430
I thought you wanted to talk to the chairman.

511
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.930
It's like catching 2 birds with 1 stone.

512
00:25:27.361 --> 00:25:28.831
My goodness.

513
00:25:31.031 --> 00:25:32.970
Hey, Mi Sook. It's me, Hong Joo.

514
00:25:33.301 --> 00:25:34.341
A car will be there soon.

515
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:35.940
You can leave for Gimpo Airport.

516
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:39.271
Yes, everything's okay.

517
00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:41.081
Kang Woo will take off right now.

518
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:42.440
Hong Joo, you brat.

519
00:25:44.081 --> 00:25:45.881
He just called me a brat.

520
00:25:46.351 --> 00:25:48.220
I haven't heard that in a while.

521
00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:49.920
I think I got him a little upset.

522
00:25:58.331 --> 00:26:00.131
- Hello. - Hello.

523
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:03.031
(ID: Choi Kang Woo)

524
00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:10.771
Hey, I'm at the airport.

525
00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:12.470
I'm sorry, Ha Ri.

526
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.210
Don't worry about it, and have a great time.

527
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.041
I'll call often to report on the progress.

528
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.210
Okay, thanks a lot.

529
00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:21.650
The check-in for Flight 801...

530
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.621
that leaves at 10:40am was closed 5 minutes ago.

531
00:26:24.551 --> 00:26:26.960
What? It's just by five minutes. Can you help me?

532
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.321
It's our policy. I'm sorry.

533
00:26:31.091 --> 00:26:32.761
What about the next flight?

534
00:26:32.761 --> 00:26:35.061
It's a holiday season, so we're fully booked.

535
00:26:36.331 --> 00:26:37.601
Give me a moment.

536
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.670
I have one seat...

537
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.440
for Flight 805, which leaves at 11:50am.

538
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.200
Yes, I'll take that.

539
00:26:47.811 --> 00:26:49.140
Kang Woo.

540
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.311
(October 11, 2015, 10:25am)

541
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:51.381
(15 minutes before Flight 801 takes off)

542
00:26:51.581 --> 00:26:53.051
I'm so sorry.

543
00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.720
My flight is at 11:50am.

544
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.480
You can go first. I'll follow right after.

545
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.121
You haven't eaten since yesterday, have you?

546
00:26:59.591 --> 00:27:03.021
Goodness, you didn't have to do this.

547
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.460
Have you eaten?

548
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:11.331
Stop it.

549
00:27:11.331 --> 00:27:13.640
What is it? What's wrong?

550
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.240
His friends are going to an amusement park today.

551
00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:21.410
Ju Won, you always get to see your friends.

552
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.740
Show me a smile, will you?

553
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.980
Whatever. Gosh.

554
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.051
Ju Won.

555
00:27:28.851 --> 00:27:30.081
Stop right there.

556
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.861
They won't fall out if you strap them on tightly.

557
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:41.200
It's all because they're too big.

558
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.200
You'll grow up very quickly.

559
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:46.000
I never thought you'd get this big,

560
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.740
but you've already gotten so big.

561
00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.341
You'll be taller than me very soon.

562
00:27:50.341 --> 00:27:51.710
How could that happen?

563
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.271
Why not? Why can't it happen?

564
00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:55.311
Why not? Why?

565
00:27:55.311 --> 00:27:56.881
- I told you to stop. - What?

566
00:27:57.111 --> 00:27:58.811
Gosh, I got my hair blow-dried.

567
00:28:00.051 --> 00:28:02.081
Goodness, my son got his hair blow-dried.

568
00:28:02.081 --> 00:28:03.220
- Did you now? - Come on.

569
00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.650
- Stop it. - Did you like that?

570
00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:09.720
Dad, come on.

571
00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:11.930
Mom!

572
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.160
Honey, stop it.

573
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.271
Oh, gosh.

574
00:28:17.271 --> 00:28:19.071
Got you.

575
00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:22.271
Goodness, look at how strong Ju Won is.

576
00:28:22.271 --> 00:28:24.240
You can even hurt me now.

577
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.410
I'm glad he did.

578
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:26.910
Are you glad?

579
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.710
Honey, should we join you on your flight?

580
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.881
No, I barely got this ticket.

581
00:28:33.051 --> 00:28:36.150
Oh, and this is from the chairman.

582
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.591
Goodness, he didn't have to do that.

583
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.621
This is great.

584
00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.390
I used a little.

585
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.160
How dare you use my money without asking?

586
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.900
Great job.

587
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:51.531
We'll get going then.

588
00:28:51.531 --> 00:28:52.571
Okay.

589
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.601
- Let's go. - I'm so sorry.

590
00:28:57.871 --> 00:28:59.640
- Bye. - Bye.

591
00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:02.480
Follow us quickly.

592
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.051
- Bye. - Bye.

593
00:29:08.051 --> 00:29:09.680
I'll see you in a little bit.

594
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.250
You don't have to say goodbye like that.

595
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.791
Come quickly.

596
00:29:14.321 --> 00:29:15.321
Okay.

597
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.960
See you soon.

598
00:29:25.371 --> 00:29:27.301
Ma'am, we have some space in front.

599
00:29:27.301 --> 00:29:28.541
Could I take your luggage?

600
00:29:28.541 --> 00:29:30.740
- Oh, thank you. - Sure.

601
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.650

602
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:47.160

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.101
- your seat belts on. - Did you put it on?

607
00:29:56.101 --> 00:29:57.400
Thank you.

608
00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:01.140
It's not scary anymore.

609
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.470
- Yes. - Right?

610
00:30:03.841 --> 00:30:07.180

613
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.920
Our flight will arrive at Jeju Airport shortly.

614
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.890
For your safety,

615
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.460
- please keep... - Look.

616
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.890
- your seat belts on. - Ju Won.

617
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.230
Look over there. It's the ocean.

618
00:30:24.831 --> 00:30:26.831
Gosh, the weather is great.

619
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:42.680
Mom, are your ears stuffy?

620
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.881
I told you to swallow some saliva.

621
00:30:45.011 --> 00:30:46.011
I will.

622
00:30:49.321 --> 00:30:50.450
Give me your hand.

842
00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.480
Sir, this is a cellphone store.

843
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.580
You should look for it at a computer store.

844
00:50:13.881 --> 00:50:15.681
Hey. Hey, mister!

845
00:50:15.681 --> 00:50:18.150
You can't go in there. Hey!

846
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:23.631
I need a location, Pentium.

847
00:50:26.761 --> 00:50:28.201
It's illegal.

848
00:50:28.261 --> 00:50:29.761
Please do this for me, Noo Ri.

849
00:50:31.971 --> 00:50:33.741
Don't say "please".

850
00:50:34.201 --> 00:50:36.841
I'll do everything you ask me to do.

851
00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.040
Thank you.

852
00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.111
(Welcome to the nurse interview.)

853
00:50:44.111 --> 00:50:46.181
Wouldn't children be afraid of you?

854
00:50:46.181 --> 00:50:48.281
It might fit better if you work at a mental clinic.

855
00:50:48.281 --> 00:50:49.451
What do you think?

856
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:52.150
Hiring only pretty and young nurses...

857
00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.420
for pediatrics is a discrimination.

858
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.960
It's rather a reality than a discrimination.

859
00:50:57.631 --> 00:51:00.230
Whose phone is ringing during the interview?

860
00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:04.201
Yes, Kang Woo.

861
00:51:05.031 --> 00:51:06.431
My kids?

862
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:08.670
Sure, I can get them ready right away.

863
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.440
I'll call them in immediately.

864
00:51:13.841 --> 00:51:16.611
Hire a lot of pretty and young nurses.

865
00:51:20.111 --> 00:51:21.250
Which way?

866
00:51:21.321 --> 00:51:22.520
Go straight.

867
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.391
He's within 30-meter radius.

868
00:51:30.091 --> 00:51:31.261
Who are you people?

869
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:33.500
Hey, Ko Jin Chul.

870
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:39.100
Our boss wants to see you.

871
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.071
- Who? - My boss.

872
00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:52.080
Hey, Ko Jin Chul.

873
00:51:52.611 --> 00:51:54.221
Jae Soo died.

874
00:51:54.551 --> 00:51:56.150
Jae Soo died.

875
00:51:56.551 --> 00:51:58.020
So you should die too.

876
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.620
Who are you? Who are you?

877
00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.290
You should die too.

878
00:52:10.931 --> 00:52:13.100
- Jae Soo died. - Get off him.

879
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:15.071
Jae Soo died, you scum!

880
00:52:15.301 --> 00:52:17.540
I'll kill you.

881
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.011
I'll kill you for sure!

882
00:52:20.111 --> 00:52:23.011
I'll kill you! I will kill you with my hands.

883
00:52:23.551 --> 00:52:25.611
I'll kill you.

884
00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.080
I don't know what's going on,

885
00:52:29.721 --> 00:52:31.551
but die first.

886
00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.861
Stand up, punk.

887
00:52:33.861 --> 00:52:35.091
- Get off him. - Let me go.

888
00:52:35.091 --> 00:52:36.290
Stop it.

889
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.091
- Let go! - Stop them.

890
00:52:39.091 --> 00:52:40.301
Who are you?

891
00:52:40.301 --> 00:52:42.100
- I'll kill you. - Stop them.

892
00:52:42.301 --> 00:52:44.670
- What are you doing? - I'll kill you.

893
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:45.931
- Let go. - Gosh.

894
00:52:45.931 --> 00:52:48.400
I'll kill you for sure, scum!

895
00:52:49.641 --> 00:52:50.911
Get them out of here.

896
00:52:57.181 --> 00:52:59.281
This isn't that simple.

897
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.551
I know, sir.

898
00:53:01.551 --> 00:53:04.091
She's your colleague? She's pretty.

899
00:53:04.891 --> 00:53:07.460
Girls like her will be way prettier if they dress up.

900
00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:12.960
I'll kill that punk for you.

901
00:53:13.091 --> 00:53:14.230
I'll do it.

902
00:53:16.631 --> 00:53:17.701
I'll do it.

903
00:53:21.641 --> 00:53:23.971
I'm an ex-convict with a record.

904
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:25.710
You should keep the law...

905
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:27.080
like you always have.

906
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.281
Don't change.

907
00:53:31.281 --> 00:53:32.281
If you do,

908
00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.520
it'll break your wife and Ju Won's hearts.

909
00:53:44.891 --> 00:53:47.301
I guess Ko Jin Chul called the company to sue you.

910
00:53:48.801 --> 00:53:49.931
You should go.

911
00:53:50.931 --> 00:53:52.100
Mr. Choi.

912
00:53:52.471 --> 00:53:54.400
It has nothing to do with you, so go.

913
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.000
How can you say that?

914
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:01.080
Ha Ri.

915
00:54:02.011 --> 00:54:03.241
Please...

916
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.480
stay out of this.

917
00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.920
Go.

918
00:54:11.591 --> 00:54:12.850
This is the exclusive news.

919
00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:15.321
On October 10, an airplane crashed into Jeju Airport,

920
00:54:15.321 --> 00:54:17.161
and it caused 190 casualties.

921
00:54:17.161 --> 00:54:20.761
The cause of Flight JH 801's crash...

922
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.701
is most likely a suicide crash of...

923
00:54:22.701 --> 00:54:26.000
the assistant pilot aiming to take insurance money.

924
00:54:26.301 --> 00:54:29.370
His colleagues have testified...

925
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:31.841
that the assistant pilot Mr. Kim suffered...

926
00:54:31.841 --> 00:54:34.111
from serious depression.

927
00:54:34.111 --> 00:54:36.611
It has been revealed that he got an insurance...

928
00:54:36.611 --> 00:54:37.850
worth 3.4 million dollars...

929
00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:41.250
through an insurance planner...

930
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:42.920
of Taeyang Insurance named Ms. Lee.

931
00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:47.221
Also, his insurance planner, Ms. Lee,

932
00:54:47.221 --> 00:54:50.960
hung herself to death last October 23.

933
00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.031
Her suicide is giving more attention to the crash.

934
00:54:58.330 --> 00:54:59.701
Unlock this.

935
00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:00.971
Mr. Choi.

936
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.040
Ha Ri, I have to go. Open this door.

937
00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.341
Open it!

938
00:55:05.341 --> 00:55:06.810
Open this door!

939
00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.781
Can someone open this door?

940
00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:13.551
Open it. Open this door!

941
00:55:13.551 --> 00:55:16.520
(Letter of Resignation)

942
00:55:18.321 --> 00:55:20.690
I heard Ko Jin Chul went to China.

943
00:55:20.891 --> 00:55:22.460
Lawyer Kim says...

944
00:55:22.761 --> 00:55:25.991
you won't end up in prison.

945
00:55:27.301 --> 00:55:29.600
We're investigating the assistant pilot's case.

946
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:31.900
It looks like Moo Shin is...

947
00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:34.040
having a hard time because Mi Ran died.

948
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.341
Life must go on, Kang Woo.

949
00:55:36.341 --> 00:55:37.440
3.4 million dollars.

950
00:55:38.741 --> 00:55:40.040
You're going to give the compensation, right?

951
00:55:41.911 --> 00:55:43.440
Who cares if the assistant pilot died,

952
00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:45.210
or if the insurance planner died?

953
00:55:45.451 --> 00:55:47.650
You'll pay the beneficiary if they make a claim.

954
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:49.920
It was a plan with special treaty,

955
00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:52.091
so it includes all kinds of deaths,

956
00:55:52.591 --> 00:55:54.120
no matter if it was a suicide or an accident.

957
00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.460
The beneficiary, Kim Bum Joon's brother.

958
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.600
He'll end up taking all 3.4 billion dollars...

959
00:56:04.971 --> 00:56:06.431
in exchange of my family's lives.

960
00:56:09.471 --> 00:56:11.270
You should take some more time off.

(Letter of Resignation)

962
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.920
Thank you for everything you've done,

963
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:27.361
Chairman Cha.

964
00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.060
What will you do from now on?

965
00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.931
How could I quit what I've been doing?

966
00:56:33.131 --> 00:56:34.631
I'll continue...

967
00:56:35.661 --> 00:56:37.730
to hang out with madmen like a mad dog.

968

969
00:56:49.881 --> 00:56:50.980
What's that?

970
00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:53.250
- Family. - Family?

971
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.120
This time, let's bet our family.

972
00:56:55.281 --> 00:56:57.321
- Who are you? - Kim Min Joon.

973
00:56:57.321 --> 00:56:58.891
Not the fake name. Your real name.

974
00:56:58.891 --> 00:57:00.420
That is my real name.

975
00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:01.920
Let's go home.

976
00:57:05.891 --> 00:57:07.460
Just leave, will you?

977
00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:11.031
Two years ago.

978
00:57:12.701 --> 00:57:14.540
We almost met.

979
00:57:16.071 --> 00:57:17.241
Don't you remember?

980
00:57:23.181 --> 00:57:25.650
What will you do now?

981
00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:27.980
- Over there. - Where?

982
00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.551
- I don't believe this. - Where is it?

983
00:57:29.551 --> 00:57:30.551
Let's go.

984
00:57:50.641 --> 00:57:51.670
Hello?

985
00:57:51.841 --> 00:57:53.781
Yes, this place is a huge mess.

986
00:57:54.011 --> 00:57:56.440
They found the assistant pilot's body yesterday.

987
00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:59.210
Yes, we only have to check it one last time.

988
00:57:59.611 --> 00:58:02.321
He's the guy who crashed the plane on purpose.

989
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.221
His blood had traces of antidepressants.

990
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:07.620
Yes, yes.

991
00:58:07.861 --> 00:58:10.491
Okay, I got it. Yes.

992
00:58:39.221 --> 00:58:40.891
Next time, call me your brother, okay?

993
00:58:41.221 --> 00:58:42.221
Okay?

994
00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:01.980
My brother.

995
00:59:08.281 --> 00:59:09.951
- Stop him. - What is he doing?

996
00:59:10.821 --> 00:59:11.821
(Mortuary)

997
00:59:13.861 --> 00:59:14.991
Open this!

998

Kim Bum Joon's brother. Come out.

Come out!

1006

The guy who left for Germany...

1007
00:59:38.181 --> 00:59:39.681
after he got his 3.4 million dollars.

1008
00:59:40.681 --> 00:59:43.080
The kid who was adopted to Germany at age seven.

1009
00:59:45.991 --> 00:59:47.491
Jan Gebauer.

1010
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:56.500
Nice to meet you.

1011
00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.801
I'm the younger brother of Kim Bum Joon,

1012
01:00:00.571 --> 01:00:02.040
who was an assistant pilot of Juhan Air Flight 801,

1013
01:00:02.471 --> 01:00:03.770
Kim Min Joon.

1014
01:00:37.071 --> 01:00:40.071
(Mad Dog)

1015
01:00:40.681 --> 01:00:43.381
I think you are overestimating yourself.

1016
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:45.310
You have no idea.

1017
01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.051
Could you run a background check?

1018
01:00:47.051 --> 01:00:49.120
Jang Ha Ri of Mad Dog isn't much.

1019
01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.551
What are you staring at?

1020
01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:52.020
Kim Min Joon.

1021
01:00:52.221 --> 01:00:53.761
What's your relationship with him?

1022
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.931
You dug too deeply into this.

1023
01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.661
What you are after...

1024
01:00:58.661 --> 01:01:00.830
and what you're curious about isn't this.

1025
01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:02.600
How could he ruin everything?

1026
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.201
Chairman Cha is amazing.

1027
01:01:04.631 --> 01:01:06.471
I can get my hands on the insurance record.

1028
01:01:06.571 --> 01:01:08.141
Did his wife do this?

1029
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:10.141
I don't hold hands with con artists.

1030
01:01:10.141 --> 01:01:12.511
Just do what I tell you, Mr. Choi.

1031
01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.980
Why did you bring us into this?
