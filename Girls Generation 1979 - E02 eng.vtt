3
00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:07.057
Park Hae Joo...

4
00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:09.726
transferred from Seyeon Girls High School...

5
00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:12.496
in Hyehwa-dong in Seoul.

6
00:00:13.397 --> 00:00:16.533
Her father is a professor...

7
00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:21.004
at Seoul University. He is a great man.

8
00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:23.807
- Seoul University? 
- Really?

9
00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:25.075
Quiet.

10
00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:28.045
Moreover, Hae Joo...

11
00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:30.113
has been top of her class...

12
00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:32.549
the entire time at Seyeon.

13
00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:34.484
- Top of her class. 
- Wow.

14
00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:37.654
As the top student at her last school...

15
00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:40.157
Well...

16
00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:43.827
Compared to you stupid pigs whose grades stink,

17
00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:46.797
she will be the model student.

18
00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:49.066
We have high hopes for her.

19
00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:53.236
Okay, Hae Joo.

20
00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:54.704
Say something.

21
00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:05.849
Don't mind those punks.

22
00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:07.784
Speak comfortably.

23
00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:10.754
Sir.

24
00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:13.657
I feel bad introducing myself...

25
00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:17.727
while my friends are being punished.

26
00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:20.197
I'd like you to let them sit back down.

27
00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.035
Wow. She's got guts.

28
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.337
- Wow. 
- Seriously.

29
00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:29.005
Oh my gosh.

30
00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.578
Hae Joo,

31
00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:38.215
not only are you smart, you have a heart of gold.

32
00:01:40.117 --> 00:01:43.286
You guys lucked out because of Hae Joo.

33
00:01:44.488 --> 00:01:45.589
Get down.

34
00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:58.034
Jung Hee. You punk. What are you doing?

35
00:01:58.034 --> 00:01:59.803
Hey, Jung Hee.

36
00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.104
Come down.

37
00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.474
Come down.

38
00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:12.015
Thank you.

39
00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:16.853
Hello.

40
00:02:17.154 --> 00:02:18.955
I'm Park Hae Joo.

41
00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:21.858
I'm not a genius,

42
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.994
or a model student.

43
00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:27.764
I'm an average student who likes...

44
00:02:27.797 --> 00:02:30.767
Sanulrim, Hae Eun Hee, and the Beatles.

45
00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:32.736
Also,

46
00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:35.005
one day,

47
00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:37.974
I want to experience passionate love.

48
00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.579
I am a hot-blooded woman.

49
00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:46.983
Yes.

50
00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.925
- It's nice to meet you. 
- Welcome.

51
00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.737
(Episode 2)

52
00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:12.475
Did you see Hae Joo's skin?

53
00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.044
Is it because she's from Seoul?

54
00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.247
She has incredibly nice skin.

55
00:03:17.314 --> 00:03:19.115
She's pretty too.

56
00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.585
She kind of looks like Jang Mee Hee.

57
00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:24.888
No way. She looks like Im Ye Jin.

58
00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:28.325
Whatever. Im Ye Jin would cry out in anger.

59
00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:29.893
Im Ye Jin? Whatever.

60
00:03:31.494 --> 00:03:32.829
She looks like Bae Yun Jung.

61
00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:35.265
- The comedian? 
- Yes.

62
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.068
- No way. 
- That's not true.

63
00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:40.203
- Not Bae Yun Jung. 
- No way.

64
00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:42.205
What? She has eyes like this...

65
00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:44.307
- just like Bae Yun Jung. 
- No way.

66
00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:50.647
Hi. You're the girl from yesterday,

67
00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:52.415
right?

68
00:03:54.284 --> 00:03:55.318
What?

69
00:03:59.756 --> 00:04:00.924
Do you know her?

70
00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:02.726
How's your knee?

71
00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:04.394
It didn't get infected?

72
00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:06.796
No.

73
00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.667
I'm glad. My dad and I were worried.

74
00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:13.703
Jung Hee?

75
00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:15.839
Hi, Jung Hee.

76
00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.208
Let's be friends.

77
00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:25.315
Hey. Jung Hee.

78
00:04:27.117 --> 00:04:29.786
That's right. We have history class.

79
00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:33.056
I didn't do my homework.

80
00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:35.558
That's right.

81
00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:46.703
What?

82
00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:49.005
We didn't even go in.

83
00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:50.874
You're being so mean.

84
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.175
What?

85
00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:55.745
What are they doing?

86
00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:57.213
We didn't do anything.

87
00:04:57.314 --> 00:05:00.016
Jung Hee, isn't that your brother?

88
00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:03.687
- Dong Moon is here too. 
- Fish Head is here too.

89
00:05:04.187 --> 00:05:05.388
What are they doing?

90
00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.924
Hey! Here she comes!

91
00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:09.626
- Yes. 
- She's coming!

92
00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:10.927
She's here.

93
00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:16.666
Are they all here to see Hae Joo?

94
00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:18.335
They are.

95
00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:20.804
I guess word got out that a pretty girl...

96
00:05:20.804 --> 00:05:23.473
transferred here from Seoul.

97
00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:26.476
What pretty girl?

98
00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.145
Let's go.

99
00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.117
Hi, Jung Hee. You just finished?

100
00:05:34.317 --> 00:05:36.653
Aren't you going down there?

101
00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:39.656
Not me. I'm here...

102
00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:42.325
to see you.

103
00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.428
Don't.

104
00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:48.264
Jung Hee. We'll go first.

105
00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.867
Wait for me! Eun Ja!

106
00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:55.605
What? Do you need to talk to me?

107
00:05:58.274 --> 00:05:59.309
Well...

108
00:06:00.677 --> 00:06:03.146
- The thing is... 
- If not, I'm leaving.

109
00:06:06.683 --> 00:06:07.784
Jung Hee.

110
00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:10.186
Aren't you hungry? Want to get pastries?

111
00:06:10.487 --> 00:06:11.955
I got my allowance.

112
00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:13.757
I don't like pastries.

113
00:06:13.757 --> 00:06:16.926
Then do you want tempura? Spicy rice cakes?

114
00:06:17.894 --> 00:06:19.796
Eat by yourself.

115
00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.164
I'm busy, so bye.

116
00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:24.734
Jung Hee.

117
00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:29.005
Why is she always so busy?

118
00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:51.194
Excuse me. Didn't we meet...

119
00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.296
yesterday at the intersection?

120
00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:54.664
The pharmacy.

121
00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:58.768
Yes. Hello.

122
00:06:58.935 --> 00:06:59.936
Hello.

123
00:07:01.638 --> 00:07:02.806
A junior?

124
00:07:04.274 --> 00:07:05.909
- Yes. 
- Then I'm older.

125
00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:08.445
I'm Son Jin, a senior at Gyeryoon.

126
00:07:08.445 --> 00:07:10.747
May I speak casually to you?

127
00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:27.497
Anyway, the thing is...

128
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.137
If you have any questions...

129
00:07:34.604 --> 00:07:36.806
or need help with anything, call me.

130
00:07:39.175 --> 00:07:40.176
But...

131
00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:50.687
Okay. Goodbye.

132
00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:53.756
See you.

133
00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:57.527
Hey. Jung Hee.

134
00:07:57.527 --> 00:07:59.496
Is it true? The cosmos flower is in your class?

135
00:07:59.496 --> 00:08:00.697
Cosmos?

136
00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:04.534
You know, the new girl that moved recently.

137
00:08:04.534 --> 00:08:06.803
Cosmos? What garbage.

138
00:08:06.803 --> 00:08:07.804
I was worried...

139
00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:11.374
because I thought Cosmos was older than me.

140
00:08:12.175 --> 00:08:13.943
How lucky. Bring her home.

141
00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:15.078
What? Why?

142
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.079
What do you mean?

143
00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:19.315
Your big brother wants to get close to her.

144
00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:23.186
Hey, Bong Soo. I saw you camped outside my school.

145
00:08:23.186 --> 00:08:24.187
Get it together...

146
00:08:24.187 --> 00:08:26.256
before I tell Father.

147
00:08:29.826 --> 00:08:31.194
Tell me what?

148
00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.962
Hello, Father.

149
00:08:34.397 --> 00:08:36.065
Tell me. What?

150
00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:37.934
It's nothing.

151
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.435
- It's nothing? 
- No.

152
00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:40.737
Okay.

153
00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.674
Why are you always bugging your brother?

154
00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:47.076
You wench.

155
00:08:47.343 --> 00:08:50.547
You couldn't be born a boy like Bong Soo.

156
00:08:51.247 --> 00:08:52.248
Go inside.

157
00:08:53.917 --> 00:08:55.285
Have a nice day!

158
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:56.286
Sure.

159
00:08:57.086 --> 00:08:58.154
Jung Hee.

160
00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:01.524
- Jung Hee. 
- Jung Hee!

161
00:09:01.858 --> 00:09:03.226
Yes?

162
00:09:03.226 --> 00:09:04.427
Show him respect.

163
00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:07.196
Get home safely, Father.

164
00:09:09.065 --> 00:09:10.066
Jung Hee.

165
00:09:11.034 --> 00:09:12.135
Jung Hee.

166
00:09:12.368 --> 00:09:13.536
Hi, number three.

167
00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.405
Jung Hee. Hey!

168
00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:17.307
Cosmos?

169
00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.813
Jung Hee. Cosmos.

170
00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.815
- She's in your class. 
- Get out of here!

171
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.184
Mom! Jung Hee is hitting me!

172
00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:30.486
What Cosmos?

173
00:09:39.963 --> 00:09:41.898
Hae Joo, that Seoul chick,

174
00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:45.134
is getting on my nerves.

175
00:09:55.044 --> 00:09:57.947
What's so pretty about the Seoul chick?

176
00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:01.918
I'm much prettier.

177
00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:07.824
(September 10, 1979)

178
00:10:10.493 --> 00:10:12.128
When will Sunday come?

179
00:10:12.495 --> 00:10:14.163
I miss Jin.

180
00:10:16.165 --> 00:10:18.935
- All right. 
- What did you bring?

181
00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:23.506
Jin.

182
00:10:23.506 --> 00:10:26.209
Jung Hee, let's eat our yummy food.

183
00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.844
I'm not hungry.

184
00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:29.846
Don't you have a broadcast today?

185
00:10:31.414 --> 00:10:34.417
We're taking turns starting this week.

186
00:10:36.986 --> 00:10:39.489
Where did the Seoul chick go?

187
00:10:39.489 --> 00:10:41.658
This is JHBS,

188
00:10:41.658 --> 00:10:44.027
Jeonghyeon's broadcasting club.

189
00:10:44.427 --> 00:10:46.562
We will now begin the afternoon broadcast.

190
00:10:47.363 --> 00:10:48.665
Hello,

191
00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:50.633
my fellow students.

192
00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:54.003
The canna flowers that graced the streets...

193
00:10:54.003 --> 00:10:56.039
have shed their petals...

194
00:10:56.039 --> 00:11:00.376
Isn't that the Seoul chick?

195
00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:02.078
But the club president was supposed to do it.

196
00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.413
Were you surprised by the unfamiliar voice?

197
00:11:04.213 --> 00:11:08.017
I'm one of your afternoon broadcasters.

198
00:11:08.017 --> 00:11:10.887
My name is Park Hae Joo.

199
00:11:11.654 --> 00:11:14.257
I'm nervous because it's my first broadcast.

200
00:11:14.724 --> 00:11:17.026
It would be very encouraging...

201
00:11:17.026 --> 00:11:19.195
if you'd cheer me on.

202
00:11:19.796 --> 00:11:20.963
Jung Hee.

203
00:11:22.198 --> 00:11:25.468
Didn't you say you'd do the broadcast?

204
00:11:25.468 --> 00:11:28.938
Carpenters' "Top of the World".

205
00:11:30.807 --> 00:11:33.076
"Top of the World". Awesome!

206
00:11:34.243 --> 00:11:36.312
I was going to,

207
00:11:36.312 --> 00:11:39.148
but I'm a senior now, so it's sort of a burden.

208
00:11:39.515 --> 00:11:41.617
- Was I okay? 
- How is Hae Joo...

209
00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:43.953
in our broadcasting club?

210
00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.556
She was the DJ at her old school.

211
00:11:46.556 --> 00:11:49.826
The club president there is my junior high friend.

212
00:11:49.826 --> 00:11:51.494
She recommended her.

213
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.003
Why was our schedule changed again?

214
00:12:01.003 --> 00:12:04.107
The instructor is going somewhere for training.

215
00:12:04.407 --> 00:12:06.542
Change quickly!

216
00:12:06.843 --> 00:12:10.313
If you're late, you have to take 10 laps.

217
00:12:10.546 --> 00:12:12.215
- You know that, right? 
- What's this?

218
00:12:12.215 --> 00:12:13.516
Where's my gym uniform?

219
00:12:13.516 --> 00:12:15.518
Look carefully.

220
00:12:17.353 --> 00:12:18.788
Hurry it up!

221
00:12:25.394 --> 00:12:27.897
Hey. Look at the Seoul chick.

222
00:12:30.466 --> 00:12:32.068
A strappy undershirt?

223
00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:35.505
Wow. Ae Sook's strappy undershirt...

224
00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.573
doesn't even compare.

225
00:12:40.276 --> 00:12:43.646
You said only delinquents wear strappy ones, right?

226
00:12:43.646 --> 00:12:45.314
Is she a one too?

227
00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:49.585
Who knows? Maybe she is a total delinquent.

228
00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.688
Where is my gym uniform?

229
00:12:54.457 --> 00:12:56.159
Attention!

230
00:12:58.294 --> 00:13:05.067
At... Ease!

231
00:13:06.803 --> 00:13:07.837
You two.

232
00:13:08.604 --> 00:13:09.605
Get up here.

233
00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:11.307
Get up here!

234
00:13:19.615 --> 00:13:20.917
Jung Hee.

235
00:13:22.118 --> 00:13:24.554
Why are you dressed like that?

236
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:28.024
I lost my gym uniform top.

237
00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:31.327
- And you? 
- I just transferred,

238
00:13:31.327 --> 00:13:33.196
so I do not have it yet.

239
00:13:34.096 --> 00:13:35.898
Being a transfer student...

240
00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.533
is an excuse!

241
00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:41.404
How could a soldier enter a war...

242
00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.606
without her uniform?

243
00:13:43.606 --> 00:13:46.542
I tried to borrow one from another class,

244
00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:49.645
but our class schedule was suddenly changed,

245
00:13:49.812 --> 00:13:52.014
so I did not have time to borrow one.

246
00:13:52.215 --> 00:13:54.617
- That is unacceptable. 
- She is pretty.

247
00:13:55.718 --> 00:13:58.187
Make the impossible possible.

248
00:13:58.554 --> 00:14:00.857
Don't you know that is the attitude...

249
00:14:00.857 --> 00:14:05.094
the youth must live by in this new era?

250
00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:06.262
We do know!

251
00:14:07.196 --> 00:14:08.865
Why aren't you answering?

252
00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:10.833
I think...

253
00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:14.036
trying to force something that is impossible...

254
00:14:14.237 --> 00:14:16.505
to make it happen is reckless.

255
00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:21.944
- What? 
- Rather,

256
00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:26.115
I think trying my best in something I can do...

257
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:28.384
is much more productive.

258
00:14:38.694 --> 00:14:39.862
Two of you.

259
00:14:40.897 --> 00:14:43.366
Take 10 laps around the field.

260
00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:45.334
That's not fair.

261
00:14:45.334 --> 00:14:47.103
Shall I make it 100?

262
00:14:50.106 --> 00:14:51.307
I'll run.

263
00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.544
What are you doing?

264
00:15:03.953 --> 00:15:05.254
Stay in line!

265
00:15:05.354 --> 00:15:07.423
If either of you stops,

266
00:15:07.857 --> 00:15:11.193
you'll have to run 200 laps!

267
00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:13.396
Attention!

268
00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.065
At ease!

269
00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:28.577
Poor Jung Hee.

270
00:15:28.577 --> 00:15:30.947
What if she faints?

271
00:15:31.547 --> 00:15:32.648
Gosh.

272
00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:34.917
What?

273
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.658
Hey. Ae Sook.

274
00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:46.629
Oh Man Sang wants you in the teacher's office.

275
00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:55.037
Ae Sook.

276
00:15:55.604 --> 00:15:58.207
You smoked in the bathroom at Ahram Church, right?

277
00:15:58.841 --> 00:15:59.875
I did not.

278
00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:03.512
Yes, you did. There was a witness.

279
00:16:03.946 --> 00:16:05.281
Darn it.

280
00:16:05.448 --> 00:16:06.816
Did Jung Hee tattle on me?

281
00:16:06.816 --> 00:16:08.951
"Did Jung Hee tattle on me?"

282
00:16:08.985 --> 00:16:12.121
I guess that means you did smoke.

283
00:16:16.092 --> 00:16:18.861
Look at these fingers.

284
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.601
Do you smoke Guhbooksun?

285
00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:27.737
No. I smoke Chungja.

286
00:16:31.507 --> 00:16:32.975
How fancy.

287
00:16:34.777 --> 00:16:37.780
Chungja?

288
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.150
Chungja? You punk. You smoke Chungja?

289
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.720
You smoked Chungja? Then get smacked!

290
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.290
You need to get smacked for smoking.

291
00:17:15.985 --> 00:17:17.019
Jung Hee.

292
00:17:17.653 --> 00:17:18.721
Sorry.

293
00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:21.557
I shouldn't have talked back.

294
00:17:21.757 --> 00:17:23.025
Run properly.

295
00:17:23.426 --> 00:17:24.627
She's watching.

296
00:17:25.227 --> 00:17:26.662
Run straight.

297
00:17:31.367 --> 00:17:33.069
Hang onto me.

298
00:17:48.751 --> 00:17:49.885
1, 2.

299
00:17:51.087 --> 00:17:52.054
What are you doing?

300
00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:53.589
1, 2.

301
00:17:54.557 --> 00:17:55.691
3, 4.

302
00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.059
1, 2.

303
00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:58.761
3, 4.

304
00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:00.763
1, 2.

305
00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:02.765
3, 4.

306
00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:04.733
1, 2.

307
00:18:05.067 --> 00:18:06.268
3, 4.

308
00:18:17.446 --> 00:18:18.514
Jung Hee.

309
00:18:19.148 --> 00:18:21.250
Are you free today after school?

310
00:18:22.251 --> 00:18:24.987
There's a lot I don't know about the broadcast club.

311
00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:29.492
I have to rush home.

312
00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:32.528
You do?

313
00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:34.530
You know Soo Nim from the club?

314
00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:36.031
The producer.

315
00:18:36.232 --> 00:18:39.034
She'll tell you anything you ask.

316
00:18:40.402 --> 00:18:41.470
Okay.

317
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:02.591
Hey.

318
00:19:03.826 --> 00:19:04.960
It was you, right?

319
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:08.998
What?

320
00:19:10.266 --> 00:19:11.800
You tattled on me...

321
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.769
about seeing me smoke, didn't you?

322
00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:15.204
To get back at me.

323
00:19:16.005 --> 00:19:19.241
Shoot. I got probation again because of you.

324
00:19:19.942 --> 00:19:21.944
I wouldn't get back at you.

325
00:19:22.044 --> 00:19:23.245
I'm not you.

326
00:19:23.646 --> 00:19:25.014
I didn't tell.

327
00:19:27.516 --> 00:19:29.752
Jung Hee. Just wait.

328
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.954
Once my probation is over,

329
00:19:32.154 --> 00:19:33.756
I'll get you back.

330
00:19:33.856 --> 00:19:36.458
I told you, it really wasn't me.

331
00:19:37.326 --> 00:19:39.428
Are you girls fighting again?

332
00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.997
Young Choon. Where are you going?

333
00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:46.001
Ae Sook, let go. It's hot.

334
00:19:46.168 --> 00:19:49.004
Are you free tonight? Want to go clubbing?

335
00:19:49.004 --> 00:19:50.839
No. I have to work.

336
00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.809
That's right. Dang Pyo was released.

337
00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:55.244
He wants to see you.

338
00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:57.846
"Released"?

339
00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:00.149
- Let's go. 
- Let go of me.

340
00:20:00.416 --> 00:20:01.951
Keep fighting. She's running away.

341
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.220
- Go catch her. 
- No, it's okay.

342
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.287
Let's go.

343
00:20:07.756 --> 00:20:09.024
Are you just getting home?

344
00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:10.926
Do you feel sick?

345
00:20:11.193 --> 00:20:12.761
No, I'm just tired.

346
00:20:12.761 --> 00:20:14.897
Was Young Choon at the pharmacy?

347
00:20:14.897 --> 00:20:17.933
Sewing machine number two broke this time.

348
00:20:19.702 --> 00:20:20.769
That's right.

349
00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:24.506
Auntie. Young Choon...

350
00:20:24.506 --> 00:20:26.275
must really be a gangster.

351
00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:30.346
He must be friends with someone in jail.

352
00:20:30.579 --> 00:20:31.947
- Is that right? 
- Yes.

353
00:20:31.947 --> 00:20:35.351
I told you to be careful, and that he's a gangster.

354
00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:38.487
We have no idea where Young Choon...

355
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:41.090
came from or what he did before.

356
00:20:42.524 --> 00:20:44.159
I'll take that, ma'am.

357
00:20:45.561 --> 00:20:49.031
Auntie. Don't be good to that gangster.

358
00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:52.434
You watch yourself too.

359
00:20:52.434 --> 00:20:54.570
- What did I do? 
- Still,

360
00:20:54.703 --> 00:20:57.606
Young Choon is good to his little sister.

361
00:20:57.606 --> 00:20:59.408
Sister? Whatever.

362
00:21:00.075 --> 00:21:03.045
People say Eng Cho is not his little sister,

363
00:21:03.412 --> 00:21:06.015
but actually his daughter.

364
00:21:06.248 --> 00:21:07.416
Really?

365
00:21:07.616 --> 00:21:10.319
Then how old was he when he had her?

366
00:21:11.086 --> 00:21:13.756
Study if you have time to calculate that.

367
00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:18.527
Auntie, why do you always wipe that chamber pot?

368
00:21:18.627 --> 00:21:20.963
- It's dirty. 
- It gets tarnished.

369
00:21:21.297 --> 00:21:23.866
You have to wipe it every day like this.

370
00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:28.203
You can go on a chamber pot wiping contest.

371
00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:31.807
Number three.

372
00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:35.277
There's no contest for wiping chamber pots.

373
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:04.106
Hello.

374
00:22:12.014 --> 00:22:15.217
It looks like the one next to it may fall too.

375
00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:19.788
I know.

376
00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:29.665
Didn't you help us with our move?

377
00:22:29.798 --> 00:22:31.066
Thank you.

378
00:22:33.969 --> 00:22:36.305
Do you work at the pharmacy?

379
00:22:42.478 --> 00:22:43.512
Okay then.

380
00:23:10.439 --> 00:23:11.740
Young Choon!

381
00:23:13.275 --> 00:23:15.310
- Eng Cho. 
- Are you okay?

382
00:23:17.346 --> 00:23:18.747
You got hit hard.

383
00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:20.416
I didn't. I'm fine.

384
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:21.950
What are you doing?

385
00:23:22.985 --> 00:23:24.653
What else? I'm working.

386
00:23:24.953 --> 00:23:27.289
Go to the pharmacy. Don't walk around alone.

387
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.058
It's boring there.

388
00:23:30.726 --> 00:23:33.028
Can't I stay here too?

389
00:23:36.565 --> 00:23:38.767
Eng Cho? What a pretty name.

390
00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:41.503
Do you want to play with me while he works?

391
00:23:41.703 --> 00:23:43.639
- Yes. 
- No, it's okay.

392
00:23:44.106 --> 00:23:45.674
I'll stay with her.

393
00:23:46.942 --> 00:23:48.277
Let's go, Eng Cho.

394
00:23:55.818 --> 00:23:56.885
Miss.

395
00:23:57.719 --> 00:23:59.021
What is that you're carrying?

396
00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:00.289
Egg pastries.

397
00:24:00.389 --> 00:24:03.525
Hae Joo made it. It's super tasty.

398
00:24:04.326 --> 00:24:05.961
Why did you take that?

399
00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:09.164
She said to give it to you.

400
00:24:14.403 --> 00:24:15.437
Let's go.

401
00:24:15.504 --> 00:24:18.740
"The night sky is a deep red,"

402
00:24:19.241 --> 00:24:23.479
"and your lips are also dyed red."

403
00:24:23.645 --> 00:24:27.549
"They look like they turned red..."

404
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:29.218
"from longing."

405
00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:34.490
Hello, my fellow students.

406
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.259
The first song today will be...

407
00:24:37.526 --> 00:24:40.529
the Carpenters... The Carpenters'...

408
00:24:40.796 --> 00:24:42.998
"Top of the World".

409
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.101
World.

410
00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:49.204
World.

411
00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:51.106
You scared me!

412
00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:52.508
What is it?

413
00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:54.376
You brat.

414
00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:57.446
Are you impersonating Olivia?

415
00:24:57.679 --> 00:24:58.847
Because you're jealous.

416
00:24:58.847 --> 00:25:01.116
- Olivia? 
- Come to think of it,

417
00:25:01.116 --> 00:25:04.453
Olivia Hussey is more her than a cosmos flower,

418
00:25:04.453 --> 00:25:06.555
so that's what I'm calling her.

419
00:25:06.555 --> 00:25:09.091
Goodness. You and your gibberish.

420
00:25:09.091 --> 00:25:10.626
I said to stay out!

421
00:25:10.626 --> 00:25:12.427
- What? - Get out!

422
00:25:12.427 --> 00:25:14.096
Stop hitting me!

423
00:25:15.097 --> 00:25:16.665
Olivia Hussey?

424
00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:21.570
(September 11, 1979)

425
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.805
Is it still only Tuesday?

426
00:25:52.067 --> 00:25:54.069
Auntie. What are you doing there?

427
00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:55.337
Hi.

428
00:25:55.671 --> 00:25:58.507
I need to put this in the master bedroom,

429
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.076
but your mom is at the factory.

430
00:26:01.577 --> 00:26:03.478
Can you put it here?

431
00:26:03.478 --> 00:26:05.714
No. You do it.

432
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:07.983
Why would I go into the master bedroom?

433
00:26:08.116 --> 00:26:10.285
- I don't want to either. 
- Gosh.

434
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.754
Give it to me.

435
00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:14.756
Give it.

436
00:26:16.425 --> 00:26:17.526
Happy?

437
00:26:19.061 --> 00:26:20.195
Get back to work.

438
00:26:20.596 --> 00:26:21.830
That's right.

439
00:26:31.506 --> 00:26:32.908
Are you studying hard?

440
00:26:33.141 --> 00:26:34.943
Yes.

441
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.244
You are?

442
00:26:36.845 --> 00:26:38.013
Do it right.

443
00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:40.515
Don't waste time doing other things.

444
00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:42.351
- Okay. 
- Good.

445
00:26:42.751 --> 00:26:46.688
Gosh. Why did your mom send a girl to school?

446
00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:48.757
Gosh. Sleep.

447
00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:54.096
A girl this, a girl that...

448
00:26:55.897 --> 00:26:59.001
Number three! Check for defects!

449
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:00.969
Yes, I'm doing that now.

450
00:27:03.138 --> 00:27:06.441
Auntie! Where did you go? You said you'd be quick.

451
00:27:06.441 --> 00:27:08.210
I'm sorry. I had to go to the washroom.

452
00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.345
Did you poop?

453
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.759
I'm so tired.

454
00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:25.627
I'm so tired.

455
00:27:26.261 --> 00:27:27.596
Where's the chamber pot?

456
00:27:28.964 --> 00:27:30.666
You've got to be kidding me.

457
00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:32.467
What are you eating so late at night?

458
00:27:32.501 --> 00:27:35.270
- What? 
- Where's the chamber pot?

459
00:27:36.238 --> 00:27:38.740
- Father took it in. 
- He did?

460
00:27:40.308 --> 00:27:41.476
What got into him?

461
00:27:42.277 --> 00:27:46.081
He pees and poops in it, but never touches it.

462
00:27:47.215 --> 00:27:48.984
That's strange.

463
00:27:52.954 --> 00:27:54.256
He touched it fine.

464
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.168
Hae Jung made it.

465
00:28:40.168 --> 00:28:41.436
It's super tasty.

466
00:28:41.436 --> 00:28:43.405
Why did you take that?

467
00:28:43.438 --> 00:28:46.174
She said to give it to you.

468
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:03.325
(September 13, 1979)

469
00:29:03.325 --> 00:29:05.026
(September 14, 1979)

470
00:29:05.026 --> 00:29:05.994
(September 15, 1979)

471
00:29:10.766 --> 00:29:12.000
Hi, Hae Joo.

472
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:16.705
What about this song?

473
00:29:16.705 --> 00:29:19.241
That sounds good.

474
00:29:19.241 --> 00:29:21.009
I like it.

475
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:23.411
This one and that one.

476
00:29:23.411 --> 00:29:24.946
How's this?

477
00:29:25.747 --> 00:29:30.318
(September 16, 1979)

478
00:29:30.485 --> 00:29:34.990
(Kim's Pharmacy)

479
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.725
Why are you always...

480
00:30:00.148 --> 00:30:01.516
Jin.

481
00:30:02.651 --> 00:30:04.085
Are you not coming today?

482
00:30:08.757 --> 00:30:11.693
Poor Jung Hee. She's waiting so long.

483
00:30:13.995 --> 00:30:15.463
That's so strange.

484
00:30:16.765 --> 00:30:18.300
He said he'd see me again.

485
00:30:27.809 --> 00:30:30.078
- I... 
- Hi, Jin.

486
00:30:39.955 --> 00:30:42.290
Hello, Jin.

487
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.759
Hi. Are you here to study?

488
00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:45.827
Yes.

489
00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:51.433
I thought you weren't coming today.

490
00:30:51.433 --> 00:30:53.635
I got here late, so I was studying...

491
00:30:53.635 --> 00:30:55.003
in the boys' room.

492
00:30:58.306 --> 00:30:59.908
Are you leaving?

493
00:31:00.809 --> 00:31:03.211
Yes, I have to go tutor.

494
00:31:04.346 --> 00:31:05.780
Don't follow me today.

495
00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.949
Study hard, okay?

496
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.285
- Okay. 
- Good.

497
00:31:11.086 --> 00:31:12.087
See you again.

498
00:31:19.427 --> 00:31:21.162
The boys' room?

499
00:31:28.036 --> 00:31:29.204
No.

500
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:30.739
I will follow him.

501
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.785
Did Jin leave already?

502
00:31:47.555 --> 00:31:48.556
Jung Hee.

503
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.392
Hi.

504
00:31:50.392 --> 00:31:51.693
Are you here to study?

505
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.029
- Yes. 
- I heard they had...

506
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:56.364
a nice music room, so I'm here to listen to music.

507
00:31:57.265 --> 00:31:58.466
I see.

508
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.335
Are you going home?

509
00:32:00.936 --> 00:32:02.003
Let's go together.

510
00:32:10.745 --> 00:32:11.746
Jung Hee.

511
00:32:13.315 --> 00:32:14.649
Is something on your mind?

512
00:32:16.217 --> 00:32:17.285
No.

513
00:32:27.762 --> 00:32:29.965
What? Another English song?

514
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.969
This is my favorite song.

515
00:32:33.969 --> 00:32:37.038
It always cheers me up when I'm down.

516
00:32:47.649 --> 00:32:51.786
We first met yesterday And fell in love

517
00:32:51.786 --> 00:32:56.524
And we made an oath

518
00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:09.337
When the night is over, I'll take the first train

519
00:33:09.504 --> 00:33:14.909
And leave for the land of happiness

520
00:33:30.125 --> 00:33:33.328
The river flows

521
00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:42.237
The river flows

522
00:33:42.337 --> 00:33:45.707
Under the bridge

523
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:50.211
Carrying our dream

524
00:33:50.278 --> 00:33:53.515
Carrying our hearts

525
00:33:53.748 --> 00:33:57.752
We first met yesterday And fell in love

526
00:33:57.819 --> 00:34:01.923
And we made an oath

527
00:34:02.057 --> 00:34:04.259
When the night is over,

528
00:34:04.325 --> 00:34:06.294
I'll take the first train

529
00:34:06.494 --> 00:34:11.466
And leave for the land of happiness

530
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.655
Go in.

531
00:34:35.623 --> 00:34:37.659
- Jung Hee. 
- Yes?

532
00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.995
To be honest, I was moved that other time.

533
00:34:42.263 --> 00:34:45.467
When we were punished and had to take laps,

534
00:34:46.267 --> 00:34:49.270
you took my hand and ran with me.

535
00:34:50.138 --> 00:34:51.906
That's when I decided...

536
00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:55.510
that I'd become best friends with you.

537
00:34:58.246 --> 00:34:59.247
Jung Hee.

538
00:35:00.615 --> 00:35:03.384
We're friends now, right?

539
00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:04.853
What?

540
00:35:07.722 --> 00:35:09.824
What a pretty bag.

541
00:35:11.559 --> 00:35:13.695
I made it in junior high.

542
00:35:13.895 --> 00:35:16.431
Is that right? You're talented.

543
00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:23.304
I'll see you at school.

544
00:35:24.305 --> 00:35:25.306
Okay.

545
00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:33.181
Good night, friend.

546
00:35:34.082 --> 00:35:35.083
Sure.

547
00:35:37.986 --> 00:35:39.187
That moment,

548
00:35:39.654 --> 00:35:43.491
I became very ashamed for how jealous I was...

549
00:35:43.525 --> 00:35:45.326
of Hae Joo the past week.

550
00:35:50.331 --> 00:35:53.101
And that's when I realized...

551
00:35:53.268 --> 00:35:57.272
that I also wanted to be good friends with her.

552
00:36:04.946 --> 00:36:05.947
Jung Hee.

553
00:36:09.217 --> 00:36:10.985
- What is it? 
- Open it.

554
00:36:19.694 --> 00:36:21.296
You said you liked it,

555
00:36:21.296 --> 00:36:22.664
so I made it last night.

556
00:36:22.997 --> 00:36:25.667
It's to commemorate our becoming friends.

557
00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:28.036
May I really...

558
00:36:29.337 --> 00:36:30.905
accept this?

559
00:36:31.472 --> 00:36:33.074
Of course, you may.

560
00:36:35.777 --> 00:36:37.045
Joint?

561
00:36:37.679 --> 00:36:38.947
With Gyeryoon High?

562
00:36:38.947 --> 00:36:39.948
Yes.

563
00:36:40.248 --> 00:36:41.849
So...

564
00:36:41.849 --> 00:36:44.719
they're coming here tomorrow afternoon.

565
00:36:45.186 --> 00:36:47.121
With their student body president.

566
00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:48.623
The student body president?

567
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:50.124
As in, Son Jin?

568
00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:51.392
Yes.

569
00:36:51.659 --> 00:36:53.661
I'm going crazy.

570
00:36:53.661 --> 00:36:54.996
Yes.

571
00:36:54.996 --> 00:36:57.098
- Jin? 
- Son Jin is coming?

572
00:36:57.098 --> 00:36:59.867
- He's coming here? 
- My heart is racing.

573
00:36:59.867 --> 00:37:01.869
This is a chance of a lifetime.

574
00:37:01.869 --> 00:37:03.638
That's right.

575
00:37:03.805 --> 00:37:05.273
While preparing the show,

576
00:37:05.273 --> 00:37:08.676
you and Jin can naturally...

577
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.145
get closer.

578
00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.015
It's too soon to relax.

579
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:16.384
- Why? 
- Hae Joo.

580
00:37:17.085 --> 00:37:19.754
That pretty Seoul girl may be an obstacle.

581
00:37:20.054 --> 00:37:21.289
What do you mean?

582
00:37:21.289 --> 00:37:23.658
Hae Joo and I are friends now.

583
00:37:24.225 --> 00:37:25.827
She'd never do that.

584
00:37:25.827 --> 00:37:29.197
What does it matter if she's good?

585
00:37:29.297 --> 00:37:31.566
How could you say that...

586
00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:34.535
after seeing the mob outside the school?

587
00:37:40.742 --> 00:37:42.010
You're right.

588
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.845
All boys are the same.

589
00:37:43.845 --> 00:37:45.747
If they see a pretty girl,

590
00:37:45.747 --> 00:37:48.616
they become complete idiots.

591
00:37:48.616 --> 00:37:50.351
Then what?

592
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:53.721
What if Son Jin falls for Hae Joo too?

593
00:37:54.155 --> 00:37:55.390
What?

594
00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:06.367
Jin.

595
00:38:13.574 --> 00:38:14.809
He can't!

596
00:38:15.043 --> 00:38:17.245
- That's right. He can't. 
- That's right. He can't.

597
00:38:17.578 --> 00:38:18.813
There's only one way.

598
00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.848
The Jang Hui Bin tactic.

599
00:38:21.115 --> 00:38:22.517
The Jang Hui Bin tactic?

600
00:38:22.583 --> 00:38:25.186
Jang Hui Bin hid all the pretty court ladies...

601
00:38:25.186 --> 00:38:27.288
where the king couldn't see them.

602
00:38:27.288 --> 00:38:29.357
In case the king...

603
00:38:29.924 --> 00:38:31.426
would like them?

604
00:38:31.659 --> 00:38:32.994
- That's right. 
- Then...

605
00:38:33.328 --> 00:38:35.596
we should hide Hae Joo where Jin...

606
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.365
won't see her?

607
00:38:38.199 --> 00:38:39.600
No.

608
00:38:39.967 --> 00:38:42.036
I can't do something so cheap.

609
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:44.706
Do you want to lose him?

610
00:38:45.106 --> 00:38:48.142
Still. I can't do that.

611
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:51.179
Don't get blood on your hands.

612
00:38:51.646 --> 00:38:54.449
We'll do it in the name of friendship.

613
00:38:59.554 --> 00:39:00.988
Where's Hae Joo?

614
00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:05.893
There was some stuff in our class.

615
00:39:05.893 --> 00:39:06.928
Really?

616
00:39:07.295 --> 00:39:10.198
Why today? The Gyeryoon guys are coming today.

617
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.537
(Self Study)

618
00:39:16.537 --> 00:39:17.805
Look at you.

619
00:39:18.239 --> 00:39:20.074
Sit straight.

620
00:39:20.575 --> 00:39:22.944
- X becomes... 
- I should kill you.

621
00:39:24.045 --> 00:39:25.079
Do you understand?

622
00:39:26.247 --> 00:39:28.116
I get it now.

623
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:30.218
I couldn't understand a thing...

624
00:39:30.218 --> 00:39:32.387
when Eun Ja tried to teach me.

625
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.255
Now, I get it.

626
00:39:34.989 --> 00:39:36.023
Good.

627
00:39:37.658 --> 00:39:39.026
What do you need?

628
00:39:41.195 --> 00:39:42.597
Thanks, Hae Joo.

629
00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:46.367
If we don't get their math grades up,

630
00:39:46.534 --> 00:39:49.203
Mr. Oh said he'd kill us all too.

631
00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:52.140
Hae Joo.

632
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.308
Don't you have to go to the broadcasting club?

633
00:39:54.909 --> 00:39:56.010
Oh no.

634
00:39:56.677 --> 00:39:58.913
- I'm late. 
- Hae Joo.

635
00:39:59.013 --> 00:40:00.948
Can you teach me this too?

636
00:40:00.948 --> 00:40:02.917
Wait. Me too. Me too.

637
00:40:02.917 --> 00:40:04.685
I need help with so many problems.

638
00:40:06.788 --> 00:40:08.856
This isn't right.

639
00:40:11.058 --> 00:40:12.260
Jung Hee.

640
00:40:12.493 --> 00:40:15.396
This goes against your fair-play attitude.

641
00:40:17.198 --> 00:40:18.499
They're coming!

642
00:40:18.866 --> 00:40:20.535
- They're coming. 
- Really?

643
00:40:20.535 --> 00:40:22.370
- He's really cute. 
- Wow.

644
00:40:24.238 --> 00:40:27.308
- He really handsome. 
- He is.

645
00:40:27.675 --> 00:40:29.143
He's so good-looking.

646
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.180
- Jin. 
- He's so good-looking.

647
00:40:35.082 --> 00:40:37.084
- Hello. 
- Nice to meet you.

648
00:40:37.718 --> 00:40:39.787
- Hello. 
- Hello.

649
00:40:40.221 --> 00:40:42.023
- Hello. 
- Hello.

650
00:40:42.123 --> 00:40:44.058
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

651
00:40:44.058 --> 00:40:47.795
- Hello. 
- Hello.

652
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:48.996
Jin.

653
00:40:49.597 --> 00:40:51.966
Are you ignoring me?

654
00:40:56.137 --> 00:40:57.238
We meet again.

655
00:40:58.973 --> 00:41:00.308
This must be fate.

656
00:41:05.179 --> 00:41:08.616
We're estimating about 150 people.

657
00:41:09.016 --> 00:41:10.518
- 150? 
- Yes.

658
00:41:10.852 --> 00:41:13.554
Let's use the auditorium here for the venue.

659
00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:16.824
"Fate." He said it was fate.

660
00:41:17.158 --> 00:41:18.559
What could he mean?

661
00:41:18.993 --> 00:41:21.796
Did he miss me too?

662
00:41:22.263 --> 00:41:23.698
Does he...

663
00:41:29.871 --> 00:41:32.373
I think we have about a week left.

664
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.408
Jung Hee...

665
00:41:34.575 --> 00:41:36.677
should be with Jin by now, right?

666
00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:39.747
She must be so grateful for our friendship,

667
00:41:39.814 --> 00:41:43.117
since we're holding Hae Joo here like this.

668
00:41:50.157 --> 00:41:51.425
Where's Hae Joo?

669
00:41:54.495 --> 00:41:56.430
Ki Ryuh, where's Hae Joo?

670
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.266
She had to run to the broadcasting club.

671
00:41:58.266 --> 00:41:59.367
- What? 
- What?

672
00:41:59.967 --> 00:42:03.404
Let's have a student from each school be the host.

673
00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:04.605
Okay.

674
00:42:04.605 --> 00:42:06.774
We decided to have me be the host.

675
00:42:06.908 --> 00:42:08.075
What about you?

676
00:42:09.577 --> 00:42:10.945
For us...

677
00:42:16.384 --> 00:42:17.518
Excuse me.

678
00:42:29.497 --> 00:42:30.932
I'm glad you're here.

679
00:42:31.699 --> 00:42:35.036
Which of you do you think should host the show?

680
00:42:35.202 --> 00:42:36.804
Maybe Hae Joo should do it.

681
00:42:37.138 --> 00:42:39.507
She's smart and speaks...

682
00:42:39.507 --> 00:42:40.908
with a Seoul accent.

683
00:42:41.075 --> 00:42:43.578
And she's pretty and tall.

684
00:42:44.946 --> 00:42:46.080
She's perfect.

685
00:42:47.615 --> 00:42:51.452
I believe Jung Hee should do it.

686
00:42:52.386 --> 00:42:54.255
This is Daegu.

687
00:42:55.389 --> 00:42:57.258
I believe Jung Hee who speaks...

688
00:42:57.258 --> 00:43:00.094
with a pretty Daegu accent should be the host.

689
00:43:00.094 --> 00:43:01.696
Jung Hee, what do you think?

690
00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:07.768
Obviously, I want to do it...

691
00:43:07.969 --> 00:43:09.270
with Jin.

692
00:43:12.039 --> 00:43:14.742
- I think Hae Joo... 
- I also think...

693
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:18.245
Jung Hee should do it.

694
00:43:19.246 --> 00:43:22.917
It's a joint broadcast representing Daegu,

695
00:43:27.388 --> 00:43:30.925
so the host should show off Daegu's charm.

696
00:43:31.025 --> 00:43:34.295
Jin is looking at me.

697
00:43:34.295 --> 00:43:35.830
Only at me.

698
00:43:36.097 --> 00:43:37.565
Then let's do that.

699
00:43:38.599 --> 00:43:39.767
Okay.

700
00:43:40.701 --> 00:43:42.103
Let's work hard.

701
00:43:45.406 --> 00:43:46.574
Thank you.

702
00:43:48.909 --> 00:43:50.077
Thank you.

703
00:43:52.647 --> 00:43:54.115
Thank you.

704
00:44:00.154 --> 00:44:01.222
Hae Joo.

705
00:44:02.523 --> 00:44:03.791
I'm sorry.

706
00:44:04.558 --> 00:44:05.660
What?

707
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:10.364
No. You're great.

708
00:44:12.099 --> 00:44:14.368
I can't wait for the broadcast.

709
00:44:14.468 --> 00:44:16.103
That's not it.

710
00:44:17.538 --> 00:44:21.242
I really am shameless.

711
00:44:28.449 --> 00:44:30.885
Let's meet by Daeil Books at Jungang Market.

712
00:44:31.519 --> 00:44:33.454
I'll wait until 5:30.

713
00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:36.924
Hae Joo. I have to go.

714
00:44:37.158 --> 00:44:38.159
What?

715
00:44:38.626 --> 00:44:39.727
Jung Hee.

716
00:44:42.997 --> 00:44:44.065
Sir.

717
00:44:44.965 --> 00:44:46.333
Here.

718
00:44:46.867 --> 00:44:48.035
Get home safely.

719
00:44:53.374 --> 00:44:54.575
Hello.

720
00:44:58.746 --> 00:45:00.114
I can't give you medicine.

721
00:45:00.514 --> 00:45:02.116
The pharmacist is out.

722
00:45:03.884 --> 00:45:04.952
I see.

723
00:45:09.123 --> 00:45:12.626
Our school is having a broadcasting show.

724
00:45:19.433 --> 00:45:21.635
Here's an invitation.

725
00:45:26.607 --> 00:45:29.243
Okay. I'll give it to the pharmacist.

726
00:45:29.243 --> 00:45:31.445
No, it's for you, mister.

727
00:45:36.016 --> 00:45:38.385
You fixed our gutter last time.

728
00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.554
I wanted to thank you.

729
00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:47.094
Please come if you have time.

730
00:45:51.198 --> 00:45:52.466
Where's Eng Cho?

731
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:55.035
Did she go somewhere?

732
00:45:56.804 --> 00:45:58.005
She's napping.

733
00:45:58.305 --> 00:45:59.874
I see.

734
00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:03.244
Okay then.

735
00:46:06.347 --> 00:46:07.615
Also,

736
00:46:10.885 --> 00:46:12.119
I'm not a "mister".

737
00:46:19.126 --> 00:46:20.394
Have a nice day.

738
00:46:37.178 --> 00:46:39.647
(Jeonghyeon and Gyeryoon Joint Broadcast Show)

739
00:46:40.147 --> 00:46:41.415
Park Hae Joo.

740
00:46:50.424 --> 00:46:53.427
Jung Hee, you brat. Why didn't you see it sooner?

741
00:46:57.198 --> 00:46:58.265
Jin!

742
00:47:05.039 --> 00:47:07.741
I only saw this now.

743
00:47:08.409 --> 00:47:09.977
Did you wait long?

744
00:47:10.578 --> 00:47:11.745
I'm sorry.

745
00:47:11.745 --> 00:47:14.682
It's okay. You're all wet.

746
00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:18.385
It's okay.

747
00:47:18.586 --> 00:47:19.753
But sorry,

748
00:47:20.487 --> 00:47:22.156
I have to go tutor.

749
00:47:25.125 --> 00:47:27.995
Here. Take this with you.

750
00:47:28.495 --> 00:47:29.763
What about you?

751
00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:32.700
I'm fine. Don't fall again.

752
00:47:33.734 --> 00:47:34.869
See you again.

753
00:47:43.844 --> 00:47:47.848
Jin just wanted to see me one more time.

754
00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:50.184
I'm sure of it.

755
00:48:02.162 --> 00:48:04.465
I could see deep in his eyes...

756
00:48:04.865 --> 00:48:06.467
just how...

757
00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:08.702
he felt.

758
00:48:10.638 --> 00:48:11.772
Have you gone insane?

759
00:48:11.772 --> 00:48:13.240
Can't you see it stopped raining?

760
00:48:14.808 --> 00:48:16.577
- I see. 
- What?

761
00:48:17.077 --> 00:48:20.514
Then why are you walking with the umbrella open?

762
00:48:21.715 --> 00:48:23.984
It's none of your business.

763
00:48:29.123 --> 00:48:30.791
She's completely insane.

764
00:48:31.325 --> 00:48:34.261
She's gone insane after chasing Jin.

765
00:48:35.262 --> 00:48:36.563
Jung Hee.

766
00:48:37.765 --> 00:48:40.701
Wait. Does she still like Jin?

767
00:48:42.236 --> 00:48:43.404
"Still"?

768
00:48:43.771 --> 00:48:46.573
She's falling deeper and deeper.

769
00:48:46.573 --> 00:48:49.310
She'll be crying her heart out soon.

770
00:49:04.224 --> 00:49:06.327
Here's an invitation.

771
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.396
Please come if you have time.

772
00:49:09.763 --> 00:49:11.065
I'm not a "mister".

773
00:49:17.237 --> 00:49:18.372
Young Choon.

774
00:49:18.906 --> 00:49:20.007
Long time no see.

775
00:49:22.176 --> 00:49:23.944
You heard I got out, right?

776
00:49:24.678 --> 00:49:25.746
Ae Sook told you.

777
00:49:26.246 --> 00:49:29.016
I heard you ignored her when she told you.

778
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:30.617
Is that right?

779
00:49:33.087 --> 00:49:36.523
Come on. A gangster doesn't become a saint...

780
00:49:36.523 --> 00:49:37.825
by living like this.

781
00:49:42.763 --> 00:49:43.764
Move.

782
00:49:44.932 --> 00:49:46.333
You coward.

783
00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:53.407
What?

784
00:49:56.543 --> 00:49:57.544
Happy?

785
00:49:57.644 --> 00:49:58.645
Go.

786
00:50:07.554 --> 00:50:09.390
Young Choon. That hurts.

787
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:10.491
Hey, "friend".

788
00:50:11.625 --> 00:50:13.927
Don't mess with me. I'll kill you.

789
00:50:21.969 --> 00:50:23.103
Jung Hee.

790
00:50:24.238 --> 00:50:25.472
What are you doing?

791
00:50:29.743 --> 00:50:30.744
Auntie.

792
00:50:33.514 --> 00:50:34.515
What...

793
00:50:35.949 --> 00:50:37.951
Gosh.

794
00:50:38.786 --> 00:50:42.156
Oh my gosh. Are you just getting home?

795
00:50:47.761 --> 00:50:48.996
Why didn't you come?

796
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:51.965
I'm sorry.

797
00:50:52.266 --> 00:50:53.467
Do you...

798
00:50:54.968 --> 00:50:57.137
Are you just getting home?

799
00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:58.138
Yes.

800
00:50:58.138 --> 00:51:00.774
Gosh. Did you drink...

801
00:51:00.974 --> 00:51:02.176
again?

802
00:51:02.176 --> 00:51:03.343
What?

803
00:51:03.944 --> 00:51:05.345
Are you sleeping already?

804
00:51:05.579 --> 00:51:07.014
Darn it.

805
00:51:08.215 --> 00:51:10.884
Why is he complaining about my sleeping?

806
00:51:13.587 --> 00:51:15.556
What are you doing at this hour?

807
00:51:16.123 --> 00:51:17.825
Something spilled here.

808
00:51:19.293 --> 00:51:20.427
What spilled?

809
00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:23.664
Did you eat?

812
00:52:04.905 --> 00:52:05.906
Hello.

813
00:52:06.306 --> 00:52:09.243
I'm Son Jin, a senior at Gyeryoon High,

814
00:52:09.243 --> 00:52:11.645
and I'll be hosting with Lee Jung Hee today.

815
00:52:11.645 --> 00:52:13.814
Lee Jung Hee!

816
00:52:24.158 --> 00:52:25.159
Jung Hee.

817
00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:28.195
The club president said to go home...

818
00:52:28.195 --> 00:52:29.496
and get rested up.

819
00:52:29.963 --> 00:52:31.098
I'm fine.

820
00:52:32.266 --> 00:52:34.635
Go home, and rest.

821
00:52:34.635 --> 00:52:36.970
That way, your voice will be nice and fresh.

822
00:52:37.237 --> 00:52:39.673
And you'll look prettier.

823
00:52:40.741 --> 00:52:43.577
Then maybe I'll go to the bath house.

824
00:52:44.011 --> 00:52:45.646
Yes, that would be good.

825

Jung Hee.

826
00:53:00.327 --> 00:53:01.562
Jung Hee.

827
00:53:01.895 --> 00:53:04.064
- What is it? 
- "What is it?"

828
00:53:04.097 --> 00:53:05.699
It isn't much.

829
00:53:06.333 --> 00:53:07.768
I wanted to thank you.

830
00:53:09.269 --> 00:53:11.471
My probation ended today.

831
00:53:11.471 --> 00:53:15.075
Thanks to you, I wasted away in detention.

832
00:53:15.075 --> 00:53:18.245
I have a nice red mark on my transcript too.

833
00:53:18.579 --> 00:53:19.846
I told you, it wasn't me.

834
00:53:19.846 --> 00:53:22.216
I didn't tell the teacher on you.

835
00:53:22.216 --> 00:53:23.984
Sure, whatever.

836
00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:25.485
Jung Hee.

837
00:53:25.886 --> 00:53:28.655
I hear you're hosting the broadcast show.

838
00:53:29.923 --> 00:53:32.926
- Why? 
- What perfect timing.

839
00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.795
Timing for what?

840
00:53:35.696 --> 00:53:39.099
For you to take the stage with all of your teeth...

841

knocked out.

842
00:53:44.638 --> 00:53:46.740
Let go.

843
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.176
Jung Hee. Clench your teeth.

844
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:50.444
Mr. Oh!

845
00:53:51.578 --> 00:53:52.946
- Get her. 
- Jung Hee!

846
00:53:52.946 --> 00:53:54.348
- Jung Hee! 
- Jung Hee!

847
00:53:54.348 --> 00:53:56.717
- Jung Hee! 
- Stop!

848
00:53:56.717 --> 00:53:58.518
Jung Hee!

849
00:53:58.952 --> 00:54:01.388
- Stop! 
- Get back here!

850
00:54:01.388 --> 00:54:03.123
- Stop! 
- No!

851
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:04.925
Stop chasing me!

852
00:54:05.659 --> 00:54:07.327
How long will you chase me?

853
00:54:07.327 --> 00:54:09.763
Stop, Jung Hee! Stop right there!

854
00:54:09.763 --> 00:54:11.598
Stop right there!

855
00:54:11.665 --> 00:54:12.766
No!

856
00:54:12.766 --> 00:54:14.735
- Stop chasing me! 
- Stop!

857
00:54:15.535 --> 00:54:17.137
Stay away from me!

858
00:54:17.137 --> 00:54:20.607
If I catch you, I'll rip you to shreds.

859
00:54:32.853 --> 00:54:34.154
Darn it.

860
00:54:34.388 --> 00:54:35.555
Darn it.

861
00:54:35.989 --> 00:54:37.658
Are you playing with us?

862
00:54:38.892 --> 00:54:40.527
You're a pretty good runner.

863
00:54:40.927 --> 00:54:43.363
Try running all you can.

864
00:54:43.463 --> 00:54:44.931
You're in the palm of my hand.

865
00:54:44.931 --> 00:54:46.099
Don't come any closer.

866
00:54:46.967 --> 00:54:48.335
"Don't come closer"?

867
00:54:48.935 --> 00:54:50.804
Keep going. It's water.

868
00:54:50.804 --> 00:54:52.306
Don't come closer. I'll really fall in.

869
00:54:52.306 --> 00:54:54.808
Then fall in. You'll fall in, not me.

870
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:56.877
Are you insane?

871
00:54:56.877 --> 00:54:58.945
I'm not insane, you are.

872
00:54:58.945 --> 00:55:01.014
Was it fun, tattling on me to the teacher?

873
00:55:01.014 --> 00:55:02.516
What do you take me for?

874
00:55:06.086 --> 00:55:07.554
Did you just duck?

875
00:55:09.222 --> 00:55:10.557
Hold her down.

876
00:55:10.557 --> 00:55:12.426
You psycho.

877
00:55:12.659 --> 00:55:14.494
- Jung Hee! 
- Stop it!

878
00:55:14.494 --> 00:55:15.495
Hey!

879
00:55:15.762 --> 00:55:17.097
Why you...

880
00:55:28.075 --> 00:55:29.309
Help me!

881
00:55:31.845 --> 00:55:34.348
- Someone help me! 
- Look at her.

882
00:55:35.115 --> 00:55:36.283
Are you a frog?

883
00:55:36.283 --> 00:55:38.218
I really can't swim!

884
00:55:38.218 --> 00:55:41.021
Jung Hee really can't swim.

885
00:55:43.123 --> 00:55:45.225
Hey. You go in.

886
00:55:45.225 --> 00:55:46.727
I can't swim.

887
00:55:49.196 --> 00:55:52.699
Jin. I guess this is how I die.

888
00:55:52.699 --> 00:55:55.035
I didn't get to share my love with you.

889
00:55:55.035 --> 00:55:57.137
I guess I'm going to die first.

890
00:55:57.237 --> 00:55:59.673
She's drowning! Oh, no!

891
00:56:03.443 --> 00:56:05.512
Jin?

892
00:56:05.912 --> 00:56:07.047
Jung Hee!

893
00:56:07.247 --> 00:56:08.582
Jung Hee!

894
00:56:14.388 --> 00:56:15.655
Jin.

895
00:56:35.575 --> 00:56:37.077
I'm so happy.

896
00:56:37.677 --> 00:56:40.747
I can die now, and I'll be happy.

897
00:56:59.366 --> 00:57:02.035
Jung Hee. Wake up.

898
00:57:02.536 --> 00:57:03.970
Jung Hee.

899
00:57:04.404 --> 00:57:06.139
Jung Hee.

900
00:57:06.139 --> 00:57:08.575
You need to give her CPR.

901
00:57:08.975 --> 00:57:10.477
Do it.

902
00:57:10.477 --> 00:57:12.412
What did they say to do?

903
00:57:12.412 --> 00:57:13.680
I don't know.

904
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.117
Get the water out. Press down on her chest.

905
00:57:17.117 --> 00:57:18.585
That's right. Get the water out!

906
00:57:18.585 --> 00:57:20.053
You do it then!

907
00:57:20.053 --> 00:57:21.154
- You do it! 
- You do it!

908
00:57:21.154 --> 00:57:24.024
- You do it! 
- Hurry!

909
00:57:24.391 --> 00:57:27.027
How can I do that?

910
00:57:27.194 --> 00:57:28.995
You do it.

911
00:57:29.863 --> 00:57:30.864
- Hey. 
- You do it.

912
00:57:30.864 --> 00:57:32.566
Hey!

913
00:57:34.134 --> 00:57:35.535
Darn it.

914
00:57:36.903 --> 00:57:38.038
Jung Hee.

915
00:57:38.472 --> 00:57:40.507
Don't die. Jung Hee.

916
00:57:44.845 --> 00:57:45.846
Jung Hee.

917
00:57:46.446 --> 00:57:47.514
Sorry.

918
00:57:48.315 --> 00:57:50.517
I'll take care of you no matter what.

919
00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:08.935
Jung Hee.

920
00:58:11.505 --> 00:58:12.539
Jung Hee.

921
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.510
Jung Hee. No, no, no.

922
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:18.178
Jung Hee.

923
00:58:21.348 --> 00:58:22.449
No.

924
00:58:24.851 --> 00:58:26.386
Mouth-to-mouth.

925
00:58:28.722 --> 00:58:29.789
Commencing.

926
00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:43.937
Is this... Mouth-to-mouth?

927
00:58:44.504 --> 00:58:47.774
Does that mean these are Jin's lips?

928
00:58:53.747 --> 00:58:56.616
Jung Hee! Jung Hee, are you okay?

929
00:58:56.683 --> 00:58:59.019
Are you awake? Jung Hee.

930
00:58:59.286 --> 00:59:01.788
You're alive. You're alive. Jung Hee.

931
00:59:01.888 --> 00:59:04.658
I'm so glad. You're alive.

932
00:59:06.259 --> 00:59:07.928
I was so scared.

933
00:59:08.261 --> 00:59:09.763
I'm so glad.

934
00:59:28.715 --> 00:59:31.451
Mom! Jung Hee's awake!

935
00:59:31.785 --> 00:59:32.886
- What? 
- Jung Hee!

936
00:59:32.953 --> 00:59:35.055
My baby girl!

937
00:59:35.488 --> 00:59:37.257
Are you finally awake?

938
00:59:37.257 --> 00:59:39.159
- Jung Hee. 
- Mom.

939
00:59:39.626 --> 00:59:42.395
- Where am I? 
- It's a hospital! Look!

940
00:59:42.929 --> 00:59:44.764
You brat!

941
00:59:45.065 --> 00:59:47.100
Do we not have water...

942
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.235
at the house?

943
00:59:49.235 --> 00:59:51.738
Why were you drinking water from the river?

944
00:59:53.406 --> 00:59:56.042
- Where's Jin? 
- What about him?

945
00:59:56.042 --> 00:59:58.244
Where's Jin, who saved me?

946
00:59:58.578 --> 01:00:01.014
You brat. Don't even get me started.

947
01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:03.016
Because of you, you brat,

948
01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.884
another family's precious son...

949
01:00:04.884 --> 01:00:07.654
almost drowned and died.

950
01:00:07.654 --> 01:00:09.155
How can I face his parents now?

951
01:00:09.155 --> 01:00:11.925
Dong Moon is hospitalized next door! Dong Moon!

952
01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.463
No way. The one who saved me...

953
01:00:16.463 --> 01:00:19.833
You may have died if not for Dong Moon.

954
01:00:31.678 --> 01:00:33.313
Shoot.

955
01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.583
Shoot. That's right.

956
01:00:37.283 --> 01:00:39.786
- I have to take a bath. 
- You crazy wench!

957
01:00:39.786 --> 01:00:42.555
You want to go into water again?

958
01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:44.791
I have to take a bath before tomorrow's show.

959
01:00:44.791 --> 01:00:46.593
The broadcast show ended already!

960
01:00:46.593 --> 01:00:48.795
What do you mean? It's tomorrow.

961
01:00:49.429 --> 01:00:51.164
Today is "tomorrow".

962
01:00:51.331 --> 01:00:54.267
You slept for over a day!

963
01:00:54.768 --> 01:00:57.437
- Today is "tomorrow"? 
- That's right.

964
01:00:58.038 --> 01:00:59.239
Is that true?

965
01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:01.908
- It is. 
- No.

966
01:01:02.275 --> 01:01:04.310
No. No!

967
01:01:04.511 --> 01:01:05.679
No what?

968
01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:08.948
- Hey! Hey! 
- Hey! Jung Hee!

969
01:01:09.115 --> 01:01:11.518
Get back here!

970
01:01:16.623 --> 01:01:18.391
Get your act together, you brat!

971
01:01:46.886 --> 01:01:48.254
It really...

972
01:01:50.623 --> 01:01:52.492
is over.

973
01:02:00.333 --> 01:02:01.434
Hae Joo.

974
01:02:02.368 --> 01:02:03.536
Don't do this.

975
01:02:06.005 --> 01:02:07.607
Please don't do this.

976
01:02:09.676 --> 01:02:11.578
Can't you think it over?

977
01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:14.447
I'm sorry.

978
01:02:15.515 --> 01:02:16.783
Why...

979
01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:19.185
don't you understand how I feel?

980
01:02:23.056 --> 01:02:24.424
Jin.

981
01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:26.926
Hae Joo?

982
01:02:29.429 --> 01:02:30.597
Are they...

983
01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:33.266
dating?

984
01:02:34.601 --> 01:02:36.102
Did Jin...

985
01:02:37.137 --> 01:02:39.305
fall for her too?

986
01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:48.515
Jung Hee.
