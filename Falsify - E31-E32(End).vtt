00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.890
(All the characters, organizations,
places, and happenings...)

2
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.220
(in this drama are all fake and
are not based on a true story.)

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.220
(Organ donations and transplants
are processed fairly under management.)

4
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.940
(The plot regarding
this matter is purely fictional.)

5
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.680
Aeguk Newspaper caught Nam Kang Myung.

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.550
And now the Splash Team's
after the Faith Center?

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.250
I thought the only thing
reporters knew how to do was lose.

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.590
Pretty good.

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.690
When the media shows us trust,
we repay with reports.

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.160
I will keep the promise
that Min Young Ho couldn't...

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.430
five years ago.

12
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.700
Are you...

13
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.240
the one who made the report?

14
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.310
(Episode 31)

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.670
Hey, you. Didn't you hear?
The first one who moves is the culprit.

16
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.920
Gosh, darn it.

17
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.990
You.

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.690
You made the report?

19
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.940
Catch him!

20
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.840
Mr. Min Ha Jun.

21
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.550
Do you admit that...

22
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.280
you covered up that Lieutenant
Jeon committed murder...

23
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.230
- with Prosecutor Im Ji Tae?
- What are you talking about?

24
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.490
You admit that you helped
Nam Kang Myung flee, don't you?

25
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.320
Hold on.

26
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.330
There must be a misunderstanding.

27
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.690
No, there isn't.

28
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.800
I'm certain that he is guilty.

29
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.330
You're under arrest for dereliction
of duty and aiding a fugitive.

30
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.970
Why did you do it?

31
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.790
You helped Nam Kang Myung and Im Ji Tae.

32
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.940
Why did you make the report? Why?

33
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.410
Will you believe me...

34
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.910
if I said I was forced to help?

35
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.720
Hey!

36
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.040
It wasn't a coincidence...

37
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.980
that he arrested you then.

38
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.380
He did it on purpose because he knew you
recognized Nam Kang Myung.

39
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.650
Can we talk to him first?

40
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.190
- Sorry?
- He's an informant after all.

41
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.120
I have to know...

42
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.030
why he wanted to meet us.

43
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.800
You said you were forced to help Im Ji Tae and Nam Kang Myung.

44
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.320
Are you claiming that someone asked you to help them?

45
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.570
I wasn't asked.

46
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.140
I was ordered.

47
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.080
I received an order...

48
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.730
from those men.

49
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.120
Do you mean...

50
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.790
men who are known as "the elders"?

51
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.990
Who are these elders?

52
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.090
I don't know who they are.

53
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.260
Nam Kang Myung...

54
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.930
called them the black curtain.

55
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.970
The black curtain founded Sahae Foundation.

56
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.940
Sahae Foundation...

57
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.940
set up Faith Center.

58
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.340
Where did you get this information?

59
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.050
I was informed that it was the work of a journalist.

60
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.240
And I stole it.

61
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.690
Why did you steal this, Detective Min?

62
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.930
I...

63
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.500
was part of Faith Center too.

64
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.400
I...

65
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.140
am also a slave that was made there.

66
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.150
I was five years old...

67
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.350
when I was sent there.

68
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.650
Since a lot of national events happened in that year,

69
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.790
they said they needed to clean the street.

70
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.790
So people were taken...

71
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.960
including kids.

72
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.530
There were adults as well.

73
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.660
Nam Kang Myung...

74
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.970
That devil...

75
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.400
chose kids among them.

76
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.340
Why did Nam Kang Myung choose kids?

77
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.940
Soldiers.

78
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.510
He said he was planning to turn us into soldiers.

79
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.150
Their project was to make soldiers...

80
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.520
who would kill at their order.

81
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.720
Tanks were enough to overthrow the government of the country.

82
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.190
It was once a nation where soldiers dominated.

83
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.700
As long as they had us,

84
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.950
they believed they could overthrow the government at any time.

85
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.470
You're telling us that...

86
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.400
just a mere foundation came up with that ridiculous project?

87
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.910
A mere foundation?

88
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.540
Do you know what this tattoo means?

89
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.150
National Security Agency.

90
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.950
You should look at the logos of the foundation and the agency.

91
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.750
(Sahae Foundation, National Security Agency)

92
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.030
(Sahae Foundation, National Security Agency)

93
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.140
(Sahae Foundation, National Security Agency)

94
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.220
Prosecutor,

95
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.650
the tattoo...

96
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.020
is a combined symbol of the foundation and the agency.

97
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.200
(National Security Agency, Sahae Foundation)

98
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.270
The powerful people of this country...

99
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.270
could ruin the city and turn innocent people into spies.

100
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.900
Faith Center wasn't founded by a mere foundation.

101
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.350
It was a project...

102
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.720
their own country aided and condoned.

103
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.720
What happened...

104
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.320
to that project?

105
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.390
It failed.

106
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.530
There was a new administration.

107
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.030
They couldn't control us even with the drugs.

108
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.770
But...

109
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.140
they didn't need soldiers who couldn't fight.

110
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.040
- At that time...
- There was a fire.

111
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.080
Where are those kids now?

112
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.110
Do they all have the same tattoo?

113
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.640
Do they still take orders from them?

114
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.850
That fire.

115
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.460
It wasn't a coincidence.

116
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.100
They started the fire on purpose...

117
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.030
to conceal the project.

118
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.830
So except the two of us, no one was able to escape.

119
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.540
Is the other one who managed to get out...

120
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.450
Is it this guy?

121
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.950
Where...

122
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.700
is this guy?

123
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.440
I don't know. I'm not lying.

124
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.960
This guy is still taking orders from them, isn't he?

125
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.830
I was useless,

126
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.970
but Jin Woo was different.

127
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.970
- Jin Woo?
- Kim Jin Woo.

128
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.470
It's a name that we came up by ourselves.

129
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.830
But why are you telling us this now?

130
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.520
Don't you think I tried in the past?

131
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.150
I wrote a letter to Daehan Newspaper!

132
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.590
But Nam Kang Myung persuaded that jerk, so that started the fire.

133
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.660
Once things turned for the worse, you were too busy running away.

134
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.760
It was you guys who betrayed us!

135
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.970
After that, I couldn't trust anyone.

136
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.140
However, five years ago,

137
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.610
when I found this,

138
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.410
I was willing to give it another try.

139
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.880
If only someone else showed up whom I could trust...

140
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.690
- If only there was one person...
- Hold on.

141
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.560
You found this five years ago?

142
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:11.760
(Draft Proposal of Faith Center, Sahae Foundation Donations)

143
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.010
They're files regarding...

144
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.470
Sahae Foundation and Faith Center.

145
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.000
There's also a fund flow statement...

146
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.320
of Chairman Min's money.

147
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.690
But...

148
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.490
who was the reporter who gathered all this information?

149
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.730
(Draft Proposal of Faith Center, Sahae Foundation Donations)

150
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.670
My name is Han Chul Ho.

151
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.010
I'm a reporter working at Daehan Newspaper's Splash Team.

152
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.510
Many of you might not be able to understand what I'm about to say.

153
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.780
But what I'm about to tell you right now...

154
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.250
is a recording...

155
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.760
of our country's criminal act,

156
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.660
which was both covered and concealed by Daehan Newspaper.

157
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.780
You're the one who brought me here. Why are you wasting my time?

158
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.480
Ms. Cha Yeon Su.

159
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.430
Ask the director to come here right now.

160
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.240
If you want him here, you should call him yourself.

161
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.670
Then give me your cell phone. I'll call him myself.

162
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.570
You can use your own cell phone.

163
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.640
Then give me my cell phone!

164
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.900
You'll get your cell phone when you're free to exit this room.

165
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.640
There's nothing you can do.

166
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.510
So just sit back down.

167
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.010
What?

168
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.650
Why are you here?

169
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.390
I'm here as your attorney.

170
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.040
I heard you said this during Yoon Seon Woo's trial...

171
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.520
regarding his subornation of perjury.

172
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.430
"He's the best lawyer that takes on only the most important cases."

173
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.670
I think it's going to take some time for your other employees to come.

174
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.770
We're going to be getting an additional report in 30 minutes.

175
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.290
What report?

176
00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.740
Apparently, there's a witness who can prove that...

177
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.140
you were involved in both Park Eung Mo...

178
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.910
and Nam Kang Myung's case.

179
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.380
Congratulations.

180
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.820
You'll be getting indicted soon.

181
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.750
Try to come up with a good plan.

182
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.520
(Daehan Newspaper tried to keep Splash Team quiet, but we won't.)

183
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.080
So what's your plan?

184
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.150
We've told all the reporters to keep their mouths shut,

185
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.400
and we've asked other media companies for their support.

186
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.900
I'll make sure this goes by quietly.

187
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.540
Director Gu, is it true that you took out Splash Team's name...

188
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.910
for Nam Kang Myung's scoop?

189
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.730
- Hey.
- They might be an eyesore,

190
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.340
but it's not right...

191
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.650
to take away their article.

192
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.170
Are you really trying to hide something?

193
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.920
Both teams were writing the scoop at the same time.

194
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.920
I have absolutely nothing to hide.

195
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.150
Okay.

196
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.030
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

197
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.730
- Yes?
- Director Gu.

198
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.180
You've been called to attend the directors' meeting.

199
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.550
Okay.

200
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.120
Something urgent came up at work.

201
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.260
I'll be there as soon as I'm done.

202
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.360
Don't worry. Your surgery will go well.

203
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.290
I'm actually glad you're not here.

204
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.400
Seeing you wait at the hospital would make me feel uncomfortable.

205
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.230
Let's see each other after the surgery.

206
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.040
Okay. See you.

207
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.730
Who are you?

208
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.750
Can't you recognize me?

209
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.390
Are you that guy who said Nam Kang Myung was still alive?

210
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.020
Yes.

211
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.120
I'm Aeguk Newspaper's Han Mu Young.

212
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.990
And I'm also Han Chul Ho's younger brother.

213
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.160
I've always wanted to meet you.

214
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.800
We have a lot to talk about.

215
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.770
Han Chul Ho's younger brother is a reporter...

216
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.040
at Aeguk Newspaper?

217
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.460
What an interesting fate.

218
00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.180
I don't know. You could call it an ill-fated relationship.

219
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.350
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have become a reporter.

220
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.240
And I also wouldn't be here right now.

221
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.160
What are you talking about?

222
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.400
There's one last article that Chul Ho failed to write.

223
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.900
I tried so hard to find out what that was for the past five years.

224
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.410
I was sure that Chul Ho got killed because of that last article.

225
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.610
I wondered what it was about...

226
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.780
and was willing to find out myself.

227
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.050
I found out that it was about Faith Center.

228
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.150
And it seems like you, the person whom Chul Ho respected the most,

229
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.390
are the one...

230
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.490
who concealed the truth.

231
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.160
You seem quite flustered.

232
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.820
But then again, you should be. That would only make things fair.

233
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.570
Because you've been...

234
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.970
controlling other people's lives with that finger of yours.

235
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.250
If you're used to getting defeated,

236
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.130
you tend to end up thinking that the world is very unfair.

237
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.150
Aren't you a professional at making things unfair?

238
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.420
You faked the statute of limitations for Park Eung Mo's case, didn't you?

239
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.490
You did, didn't you?

240
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.340
I don't know anything about that.

241
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.760
Prosecutor Im...

242
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.260
got charged yesterday afternoon.

243
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:14.500
And he testified that you gave him evidence to prove that...

244
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.800
Seo Hae Young was alive...

245
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.410
until 2001.

246
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.750
He'll probably say anything since he's desperate to get out of this.

247
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.820
I've never heard of this before.

248
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.250
Seo Hae Young was here with you at this event.

249
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.020
Are you still going to pretend like you don't know anything?

250
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.530
Seo Hae Young was Faith Center's whistle-blower.

251
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.630
She probably visited you to reveal the truth.

252
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.000
But...

253
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.240
you betrayed the informant.

254
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:54.070
You made sure to keep Park Eung Mo's mouth shut forever.

255
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.780
Then you fabricated the statute of limitations...

256
00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.650
and made a fool out of her death.

257
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.380
Did you feel the need...

258
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.850
to shut my brother up like you did with Seo Hae Young?

259
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.760
- What did you say?
- Why did you...

260
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.090
leave my brother to die like that?

261
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.380
Did you order people to kill him yourself?

262
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.850
Stop talking nonsense!

263
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.240
You knew Chul Ho was going to die!

264
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.070
Did he tell you that he found something out about Faith Center?

265
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.860
In order to hide the truth, you made Seo Hae Young die,

266
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.030
you helped Nam Kang Myung, made Yoon Seon Woo guilty,

267
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.770
and you even overlooked Park Eung Mo's criminal acts.

268
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.240
Did you not want to let all your efforts go to waste?

269
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.720
Is that why you left my brother to die?

270
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:47.390
Or was it because you were also involved in what happened there?

271
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.260
I don't feel the need to talk to you anymore.

272
00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.200
You knew what happened at Faith Center, didn't you?

273
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.810
You knew, didn't you?

274
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.610
You shouldn't have kept quiet if you were a true reporter.

275
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.550
You knew what those kids had to go through!

276
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.150
If you don't want to lose the one you love too,

277
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.420
you better tell me.

278
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.880
What?

279
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.330
I'm sure you don't want to go through that pain.

280
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.030
What do you mean?

281
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.970
What are you implying?

282
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.510
Answer your phone.

283
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.440
I'm sure it's a very important phone call.

284
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.120
- Hello?
- Director Gu.

285
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.220
I know very well what you're trying to do right now.

286
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.820
But if you say the wrong thing,

287
00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.730
your wife will also die like Nam Kang Myung.

288
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.560
How do you think he ended up dying in the middle of the road?

289
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.340
We hacked into his artificial heart.

290
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.390
If you don't want the same thing happening to your wife,

291
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.510
you better keep your mouth shut.

292
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.540
Okay?

293
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.940
What did you say?

294
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.520
Start hacking the system,

295
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.080
and don't leave a trace.

296
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.290
The serial code is 4, 19, 6...

297
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.790
I'm going to ask you one more time.

298
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.630
Did you know that Chul Ho was going to get killed?

299
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.860
Get out of my way!

300
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.570
Did you know or not?

301
00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.190
Move! My wife's life is in danger.

302
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.440
Yes.

303
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.090
I know.

304
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.080
Suk Min gave me the recording file yesterday.

305
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.450
I could guess how Cho Young Ki was able to kill Nam Kang Myung.

306
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.420
But do you know this?

307
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.750
I'm capable of...

308
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.560
becoming as corrupt as you are.

309
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.070
What?

310
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.790
You were in control of my brother's lifeline.

311
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.430
Now, your wife's lifeline...

312
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.470
is in my hands.

313
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.520
You crazy jerk.

314
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.840
Aeguk Newspaper's reporters are at the hospital.

315
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.510
If you tell me the truth,

316
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.540
you'll be able to prevent her from getting surgery.

317
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.510
My gosh.

318
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.630
Why did you have a change of heart?

319
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:21.870
Get out of my way!

320
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.020
Why did you succumb to them?

321
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.790
Was it for your wife's heart transplant?

322
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.260
Is that why you didn't mind getting your hands dirty?

323
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:34.130
And was it difficult to return because it felt great to have power?

324
00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.730
Please get out of my way.

325
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.730
- Please let me go.
- But...

326
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.440
now you know that you're only going to end up getting used.

327
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.040
So please tell me the truth.

328
00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.100
My brother was a fool who got orders to write fabricated articles.

329
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.780
But he mustered up his courage towards the end.

330
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.320
He asked me to help him so that he'll never give up.

331
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.520
But why is it so hard for you to do the same?

332
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.630
You had the courage to ruin other people's lives.

333
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.080
But why?

334
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.230
Why is it so hard for you to tell the truth? Why?

335
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.720
Please let me go.

336
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.190
- Tell me.
- Please get out of my way.

337
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.020
Tell me the truth!

338
00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.340
It wasn't me!

339
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:21.940
I was against it.

340
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.610
They decided to kill him. They said Chul Ho was too deeply involved.

341
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.220
Then you should've kept protecting him.

342
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.530
They purposely started a fire and burned that place down.

343
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.430
They did such a horrible thing...

344
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.300
to those little kids.

345
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.720
But how could you help them?

346
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.040
Cho Young Ki was the one who took the lead.

347
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.070
He's their spokesperson.

348
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.280
I just used the media...

349
00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.850
to help them.

350
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.610
Are you saying you used Daehan Newspaper...

351
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.100
for Sahae Foundation's advantage?

352
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.420
Yes.

353
00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.490
So please...

354
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.120
save my wife now.

355
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.500
There's no need to stop the surgery...

356
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.770
because it never even started in the first place.

357
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.270
Everything's over, Director Gu.

358
00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.040
Okay.

359
00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.970
Good job.

360
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.860
You recorded everything, right?

361
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.260
Give me the recordings.

362

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.740
Cho Young Ki to get punished for instigating murder,

364

367
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.990

368
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.320
the article that Chul Ho had written five years ago.

369

We're...

370

going to finish what he couldn't.

The prosecution's waiting for you outside,

372
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.830
so go and take responsibility for what you did.

That's...

374
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.840
the least you can do...

375
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.210
for Chul Ho and everyone else who had their trust in you.

I'm a reporter working

Many of you might not be able

But what I'm about to tell you right now...

451
00:31:04.481 --> 00:31:06.417
is a recording...

452
00:31:07.551 --> 00:31:09.119
of our country's criminal act,

453
00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:13.824
which was both covered
and concealed by Daehan Newspaper.

454
00:31:15.759 --> 00:31:19.229
During my 10 years as
a reporter at Daehan Newspaper,

455
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.967
I took part in numerous
fabricated articles.

It was much easier than I'd thought
to completely turn a case over...

457
00:31:28.172 --> 00:31:30.107
with a single sentence in an article.

("Coast Guard Murder Suspect Arrested")

459

the innocent into the guilty,

was Daehan Newspaper.

463
00:31:43.387 --> 00:31:45.022
And at the center of it all...

464

At first, I did not believe it.

470
00:32:04.441 --> 00:32:08.278
But it didn't take long for me to realize the truth.

471
00:32:09.813 --> 00:32:11.181
Because I, myself,

472
00:32:13.617 --> 00:32:15.352
was the evidence.

473
00:32:17.087 --> 00:32:18.989
All the articles I fabricated...

474
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.159
existed to erase traces of the Faith Center,

475
00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:25.229
and Sahae Foundation which was behind it all.

476
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:32.669
If someone is watching this video,

477
00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:38.409
it probably means that I'm no longer in this world.

478
00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:41.712
I could not fight against injustice,

479
00:32:42.212 --> 00:32:44.047
and despise evil deeds.

480
00:32:44.915 --> 00:32:46.950
So I am not a respectable reporter.

481
00:32:48.552 --> 00:32:51.722

But my fabricated articles and death...

484
00:33:02.132 --> 00:33:04.735
will become the sure evidence that points...

485

488

I hope all the reporters I respect...

489
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.249
use my regret as the stepping stone...

490
00:33:20.918 --> 00:33:23.287

516

This was revealed through a video that Daehan Newspaper's...

517

reporter Han Chul Ho left before his death.

The moment I abandoned them and ran away.

595

That cowardly moment of my life.

Even when I was intoxicated by power,

597
00:40:31.381 --> 00:40:33.550
I couldn't wipe that moment from my life.

598

That...

658
00:45:52.602 --> 00:45:54.537
was the order I was given.

659
00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.107
I had no other way to live...

660
00:45:58.841 --> 00:46:00.710
aside from obeying their orders.

661
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.848
But I regretted it.

662
00:46:06.149 --> 00:46:07.350
I regretted what I did to Han Chul Ho.

663
00:46:09.152 --> 00:46:11.888
I didn't know that he was preparing to write the article.

664
00:46:19.429 --> 00:46:20.463
What are you doing?

665
00:46:21.631 --> 00:46:22.699
Stop, Kim Jin Woo.

666
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.202
I'm not saying I'm going to forgive you,

667
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:29.038
but please stop.

668
00:46:30.039 --> 00:46:31.641
16 years ago,

669
00:46:33.509 --> 00:46:34.777
what would've happened...

670
00:46:36.212 --> 00:46:38.181
if you guys came instead of Gu Tae Won?

671
00:46:38.181 --> 00:46:39.249
Put it down.

672
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:41.784
Put it down and talk!

673
00:46:41.784 --> 00:46:43.853
"Commit suicide when your identity is exposed."

674
00:46:47.257 --> 00:46:48.758
That's all I have.

675
00:46:49.459 --> 00:46:50.460
This...

676
00:46:51.761 --> 00:46:53.062
is the order I was given.

677
00:46:54.063 --> 00:46:55.131
No!

678
00:47:30.033 --> 00:47:32.302
I came here to deliver the elders' message.

679
00:47:32.969 --> 00:47:34.003
I won't hear it.

680
00:47:35.338 --> 00:47:36.439
I'm not charged with a felony.

681
00:47:36.673 --> 00:47:39.642
If a couple of the charges get thrown out, I can get out of this.

682
00:47:51.454 --> 00:47:52.989
The plan's been canceled.

683
00:47:54.057 --> 00:47:57.427
But the sample Nam Kang Myung left behind is still there.

684
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:03.833
I did not disclose...

685
00:48:04.067 --> 00:48:06.202
the names of the elders.

686
00:48:06.269 --> 00:48:10.073
I wouldn't have come here if you'd gone that far.

687
00:48:12.542 --> 00:48:14.677
It will appear like a heart attack.

688
00:48:15.978 --> 00:48:17.580
You still have family left.

689
00:48:17.914 --> 00:48:19.282
Leave in silence.

690
00:48:29.359 --> 00:48:31.461
I could not fight against injustice...

691
00:48:31.928 --> 00:48:33.830
and despise evil deeds.

692
00:48:34.964 --> 00:48:37.100
So I am not a respectable reporter.

693
00:48:38.568 --> 00:48:41.838
But I didn't want to remain silent until the very end.

694
00:48:46.509 --> 00:48:47.643
Why...

695
00:48:49.579 --> 00:48:52.448
couldn't I despise you guys?

696
00:48:52.749 --> 00:48:53.750
Excuse me?

697
00:49:44.233 --> 00:49:45.568
Take good care of them...

698
00:49:47.837 --> 00:49:49.238
while I'm gone.

699
00:49:49.439 --> 00:49:52.508
You'd better not cry because I'm not there.

(Prosecutor's office)

701
00:50:04.387 --> 00:50:07.190
What are you doing here?

702
00:50:08.257 --> 00:50:10.359
I wanted to be your escort, so that you don't...

703
00:50:10.593 --> 00:50:12.328
get distracted at the special prosecutor's office.

704
00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:22.371
Thank you for everything.

705
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.142
Is that what you decided on?

706
00:50:27.009 --> 00:50:27.977
You're going to leave?

707
00:50:28.377 --> 00:50:29.779
I said this before.

708
00:50:30.079 --> 00:50:32.648
I'm Han Mu Young before I'm Han Chul Ho's brother.

709
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:35.852
I think I'll need time to find myself again.

710
00:50:38.454 --> 00:50:40.089
I want to stop you.

711
00:50:42.792 --> 00:50:46.128
There aren't much clues left on the Sahae Foundation.

712
00:50:46.128 --> 00:50:48.598
Isn't this when a reporter's connections come in handy?

713
00:50:48.598 --> 00:50:50.700
There are much better reporters out there.

714
00:50:51.434 --> 00:50:52.568
Don't you remember?

715
00:50:53.169 --> 00:50:55.571
It's all because you of that we figured all this out...

716
00:50:56.539 --> 00:50:58.374
about Sahae Foundation and Faith Center.

717
00:51:00.409 --> 00:51:02.178
Being an Aeguk Newspaper reporter...

718
00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.748
fits you the best.

719
00:51:07.617 --> 00:51:09.051
So come back.

720
00:51:09.318 --> 00:51:11.687
You have to. I'll be waiting.

721
00:51:13.422 --> 00:51:14.457
Okay.

722
00:51:25.368 --> 00:51:26.369
Thank you.

(Statement of funds)

724
00:51:47.924 --> 00:51:49.892
The documents I've just handed out...

725
00:51:50.259 --> 00:51:53.262
is the fund statements of President Min Young Ho,

726
00:51:53.262 --> 00:51:56.299
whose death was set up as a result of Alzheimer's 5 years ago.

727
00:51:57.199 --> 00:51:59.869
Several witnesses involved with Sahae Foundation have died,

728
00:51:59.869 --> 00:52:03.339
and evidence has been destroyed. This investigation will be hard.

729
00:52:06.142 --> 00:52:08.177
But I plan to begin...

730
00:52:10.279 --> 00:52:14.350
with President Min Young Ho, the man who led us here.

731
00:52:16.118 --> 00:52:17.453

Chief, did you hear?

734
00:52:34.704 --> 00:52:37.039
Jung Hae Dong's dismissal was rejected.

735
00:52:37.273 --> 00:52:40.209
Gosh, I knew this would happen.

736
00:52:40.409 --> 00:52:43.579
These scums never die out.

737
00:52:43.779 --> 00:52:47.249
Do you think they'll start pressuring us again?

738
00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:49.118
What can we do?

739
00:52:49.852 --> 00:52:50.987
We have to be prepared.

740
00:52:51.153 --> 00:52:52.188
- What?
- What?

741
00:52:53.422 --> 00:52:56.859
For your information, a true reporter...

742
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.029
has to rot in a dark corner...

743
00:53:00.029 --> 00:53:02.098
for at least five years...

744
00:53:05.034 --> 00:53:06.068

It's over. I think he's set.

How many journalists do you think would try knowing it wouldn't work?

748
00:53:30.359 --> 00:53:31.594
I like him.

749
00:53:32.328 --> 00:53:35.398
He can be reckless like this because he's a journalist. Don't you think?

750
00:53:43.739 --> 00:53:44.707
Okay, looks good.

751
00:53:44.707 --> 00:53:46.442
- Gosh!
- That's great.

752
00:53:46.442 --> 00:53:47.643
- That's good.
- Yes.

753
00:53:47.643 --> 00:53:48.678
- Just like that.
- Gosh!

754
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:51.747
- Okay!
- How about something like this?

755
00:53:51.747 --> 00:53:53.849
- Yes!
- That looks great.

756

Is the list of questions ready?

760
00:54:02.058 --> 00:54:05.828
I did write up a list, but...

761
00:54:05.828 --> 00:54:07.563
Give it here.

762
00:54:07.563 --> 00:54:11.267
Do you really have to do this?

763
00:54:11.367 --> 00:54:14.804
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

764
00:54:15.071 --> 00:54:18.207
Han Mu Young, when you emptied out Nam Kang Myung's vault,

765
00:54:18.207 --> 00:54:19.341
what did you tell me?

766
00:54:19.742 --> 00:54:22.111
You said you'd give me an interview,

767
00:54:22.178 --> 00:54:24.180
and include it in the pages. Didn't you?

768
00:54:24.313 --> 00:54:26.348
I definitely did.

769
00:54:26.649 --> 00:54:29.618
We prepared a good story that would even make Oprah Winfrey cry.

770
00:54:29.618 --> 00:54:30.619
Of course.

What do you mean it's over?

789
00:55:34.383 --> 00:55:36.519
It's not over until we find the person responsible for Faith Center,

790
00:55:36.719 --> 00:55:39.488
and get to the bottom of Sahae Foundation.

You're trying to run off on your own?

I think I did everything I could.

Mister, have you heard of the Splash Team?

801
00:56:18.727 --> 00:56:21.797
It's the team that contributed to exposing the Sahae Foundation.

802

Yes, that's the Splash Team.

803

They're better.

804

You're not working anymore.

Who says you can do that?

813
00:56:59.668 --> 00:57:02.771
This is the place the Director of Sahae Foundation...

814
00:57:03.439 --> 00:57:06.242
used as his personal office. Right?

815
00:57:06.242 --> 00:57:07.443
Yes, I'm sure of it.

816
00:57:08.677 --> 00:57:12.181
But you have to keep it a secret...

817
00:57:12.348 --> 00:57:14.250
that I reported this.

818
00:57:19.889 --> 00:57:22.391
Yes, this is how it always was.

819
00:57:23.158 --> 00:57:25.461
I have no qualifications and no one recommended this to me,

820
00:57:26.228 --> 00:57:28.631
but the desire to throw a stone to the world...

821
00:57:28.998 --> 00:57:30.599
led us here.

Reporter Han Mu Young.

823
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.481
I thought you were done with this.

824
00:57:54.623 --> 00:57:57.159
I don't know what's waiting ahead of me.

825
00:57:57.793 --> 00:58:00.329
However, let's not be afraid.

826
00:58:20.182 --> 00:58:21.250
Are we doing this?

827
00:58:22.718 --> 00:58:24.219
We can't turn back now.

828
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:27.389
You're confident that you can do this, right?

829
00:58:29.591 --> 00:58:33.228
As long as we care and have the courage to hate the evil,

830
00:58:33.929 --> 00:58:36.598
the world will give us at least a chance...

831
00:58:36.999 --> 00:58:39.368
to right an injustice.

832
00:58:40.469 --> 00:58:43.439
(We'd like to thank you for watching and supporting "Falsify".)
