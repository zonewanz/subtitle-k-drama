3
00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:11.513
- Ow!
- Oh!

4
00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:13.797
Ow!

5
00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.426
Are you drunk?

6
00:00:15.426 --> 00:00:18.370
No, I just trip really often.

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.108
Get up, then.

8
00:00:21.108 --> 00:00:22.876
I don't want to get up.

9
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.812
There's that saying: "If you've tripped,
take a break before you keep going."

10
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:30.486
I think I might just lie down here.

11
00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:33.449
Are you being coy with me?

12
00:00:35.123 --> 00:00:36.766
Not at all!

13
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.476
Playing coy?

14
00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:40.694
That's the first time that
anyone has said that to me!

15
00:00:40.694 --> 00:00:42.211
That's like, the opposite of me!

16
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:44.602
Everyone who knows me says that
I'm super masculine!

17
00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:48.428
They may be wrong, or maybe they
just haven't seen this side of you yet.

18
00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:50.467
People only see as much of
you as you let them.

19
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.889
You seem super precocious.
Did you know that?

20
00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.011
You can't enjoy being young and
careless when you're not young anymore.

21
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:02.434
All right, Big Sis.

22
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.984
"Big Sis?"

23
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.273
Ugh, don't call me that.

24
00:01:10.273 --> 00:01:11.773
It feels really insulting.

25
00:01:11.773 --> 00:01:13.556
It makes me feel like
I'm a lot older.

26
00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:16.031
And that I'm an adult,
and that I'm your superior.

27
00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:17.115
Don't call me that.

28
00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:19.336
You know that you contradict
yourself a lot, right?

29
00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:21.190
I know. Human beings are all
walking balls of contradiction.

30
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.448
All right, Hyun Soo.

31
00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:26.486
Nah, that's not it.

32
00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.059
What about Ms. Hyun Soo?

33
00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:34.894
Write down your phone
number for me.

34
00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:37.097
I'll call you.

35
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.576
Don't put your guard up.

36
00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:40.493
I'm not going to
do that anymore.

37
00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:44.672
But I don't have a pen.

38
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.055
Just tell me, then.
I'll memorize it.

39
00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.280
Oh, you're sleeping over?
Why did you take a shower?

40
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.720
As if they'd sleep over.

41
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.524
They didn't shower. They had
a shower forced on them.

42
00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:20.893
Sounds like you're gloating about
the fact that we got drenched.

43
00:02:20.893 --> 00:02:23.434
Not gloating, exactly.

44
00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:25.171
I just wish I'd been
there to see it.

45
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:27.322
Can't you be a bit nicer,
Lee Hyun Yi?

46
00:02:27.322 --> 00:02:29.049
What if I have to
pick you two up

47
00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.094
at the police station next time
for public indecency?

48
00:02:31.094 --> 00:02:33.641
Did someone throw water on you for PDA?

49
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:36.529
Wow, Hyun Soo!
You're so smart!

50
00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.008
How did you manage to figure
that out, just by looking?

51
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.996
It's because you're like that
that she's messed up, Mom.

52
00:02:41.996 --> 00:02:44.419
How dare you refer to your
older sister like that?

53
00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:45.965
It's all right.

54
00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:48.327
That'll fix itself
once she gets married.

55
00:02:48.327 --> 00:02:51.669
Trying to force her to fit into
a mold will just make her worse.

56
00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:52.953
You're right, Honey.

57
00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:54.721
- Ew!
- Ew!

58
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:55.958
- Come here, Honey.
- Okay.

59
00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.370
Move over!
Sheesh!

60
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.752
The spot next to my man
is mine forever!

61
00:02:59.752 --> 00:03:01.287
Oh, I'll bet.

62
00:03:01.287 --> 00:03:04.210
You two should be
so thankful to us.

63
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.601
There's no greater gift to a child

64
00:03:06.601 --> 00:03:08.502
than showing them how much
their parents love each other.

65
00:03:08.502 --> 00:03:09.879
Of course.

66
00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.012
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Wow.

67
00:03:12.012 --> 00:03:15.025
You look so much prettier
without any makeup on.

68
00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:16.656
Yep.

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:20.081
Do your best today, too!

75
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.534
With tons of energy!

76
00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:47.207
Turn that off!

Hello?

82
00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.663
It's Ohn Jeon Seon.

83
00:05:39.264 --> 00:05:41.546
Oh, I was thinking about
going to see you.

84
00:05:42.132 --> 00:05:44.334
I need to ask you some questions.
When do you have time?

85
00:05:44.334 --> 00:05:46.387
Let's eat together.

86
00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:49.464
Geez.

87
00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:52.486
Go ahead. What is it
that you want to say?

88
00:05:53.238 --> 00:05:54.779
Writer Park.

89

Can I... please take the day off?

90
00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:00.920
You want the day off?

91
00:06:01.704 --> 00:06:03.209
Yes.

92
00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:06.517
Go ahead, then.

93
00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:10.784
Thank you, Writer Park!
I'll work even harder when I come back!

00:06:10.784 --> 00:06:12.276
"Come back?"

95
00:06:12.276 --> 00:06:13.637
Are you going somewhere?

We're going all the way to Beolgyo
to eat cockles?

99
00:06:36.224 --> 00:06:39.406
I'm sure there are good cockle
places in Seoul too, if we look.

100
00:06:39.406 --> 00:06:41.824
I want to eat them at the place
that is known for its cockles, though.

101
00:06:41.824 --> 00:06:44.488
To me, eating is just eating

102
00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:46.647
but eating is kind of like studying
for you, isn't it, Mr. Jung Seon?

103
00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:50.017
Yes. But what did you want to
interview me about?

104
00:06:50.983 --> 00:06:52.329
Just something.

105

Fine.

this past year as
an assistant writer.

115
00:07:43.474 --> 00:07:46.216
Wow, sounds like being an
assistant writer is really tough.

116
00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.007
But, is it okay for you
to take the day off today?

117
00:07:49.007 --> 00:07:50.892
It's not that Writer Park
didn't let me take days off.

118
00:07:50.892 --> 00:07:55.582
I just felt bad asking for a day off when
she worked so hard, so I never asked.

119
00:07:55.582 --> 00:07:58.901
That's the same thing as her
not letting you take a day off.

How's "A Man Who Eats Rare Steak"?

I was going to use that as the
title of a TV show.

122

I'm not sure.

123
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.796
Is there a special personality trait
among guys who eat steaks rare?

124
00:08:13.796 --> 00:08:15.192
I've never thought about it.

125
00:08:15.192 --> 00:08:16.644
Well, start thinking about it right now.

126
00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:20.702
Are you that happy?

127
00:08:20.702 --> 00:08:22.327
Yes.
I'm happy.

- Wow!

129
00:09:00.057 --> 00:09:01.733
This is nice.

130
00:09:03.132 --> 00:09:04.723
This is nice.

131
00:09:08.632 --> 00:09:10.670
So, so nice.

132
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.051
Oh gosh!

133
00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:16.443
Geez, be careful.

134
00:09:18.522 --> 00:09:20.227
I'm hungry now.

135
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:22.036
Let's go eat.

136
00:09:28.243 --> 00:09:30.376

- Thank you.

137
00:09:30.376 --> 00:09:32.180
- Enjoy your meal.
- All right.

138
00:09:54.932 --> 00:09:56.609
Yum!

139
00:09:57.676 --> 00:10:01.171
I was wondering why you smelled it first,
but now I can taste it better!

140
00:10:01.672 --> 00:10:03.444
You're a quick learner.

141
00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:04.988
I was always decent
at studying.

142
00:10:04.988 --> 00:10:07.046
And you're great at bragging
about yourself, too.

143
00:10:07.046 --> 00:10:09.403
It's because my self-esteem
has been pretty low lately.

144
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.383
Because nobody around me
is complimenting me.

145
00:10:14.507 --> 00:10:16.296
I don't really like
raw seafood.

146
00:10:19.528 --> 00:10:21.224
I thought you said that
you don't like it.

147
00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:24.761
I told you before that human beings
are walking balls of contradiction.

148
00:10:28.032 --> 00:10:30.169
Wow, that's delicious!

149
00:10:31.493 --> 00:10:33.282
Where are we going to go
after we finish eating?

150
00:10:33.282 --> 00:10:36.953
Um... well, we've eaten food. Now we
have to go enjoy works of literature.

151
00:10:36.953 --> 00:10:39.051
Oh, sure.

152
00:10:47.574 --> 00:10:49.186
What a shame.

153
00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:52.627
We got here too late, and all
of the galleries are closed.

154
00:10:52.627 --> 00:10:56.315
I really wanted to visit the Taebaek
Mountains Literature Museum, at least.

155
00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.813
Have you ever read
"Taebaek Mountain Range"?

156
00:10:59.813 --> 00:11:01.531
I didn't even know that was a book.

157
00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:05.470
Wow, I can really feel the difference
in our ages now.

158
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.259
It's not an age difference thing.
It's an intellectual difference.

159
00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:10.801
We'll just call it a difference

160
00:11:13.027 --> 00:11:17.921
Is there a special personality trait
among guys who eat steaks rare?

161
00:11:17.921 --> 00:11:20.156
I thought about it
for a while

162
00:11:20.156 --> 00:11:22.214
and it's just a difference in
preference, not personality.

163
00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:24.633
They just prefer it because it's
tender due to all of the juices

164
00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:26.691
and because they like the
unique scent of raw meat.

165
00:11:26.691 --> 00:11:28.372
Oh, that won't do.

166
00:11:28.372 --> 00:11:30.291
They need to have a special
personality trait.

167
00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:32.431
People from Western cultures
tend to prefer rare beef.

168
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:35.152
You're so stubborn.
Just tell me!

169
00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:38.416
Try to use your imagination
instead of trying to change facts.

170
00:11:40.348 --> 00:11:42.680
I think you're good at
attacking people with facts.

No.

Women have this fantasy...

00:18:08.408 --> 00:18:14.282
that a man who kisses her
does it because he loves her.

Who told you to put tofu

You're doing this on purpose

253
00:21:20.724 --> 00:21:22.970
because you know I can't eat
rice without soup, right?

254

You're being shrewd because you

Why are you here?

272
00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:12.222
I never said that I was
quitting, Writer Park.

273
00:23:13.365 --> 00:23:17.131
You said you were taking a day off, so
I thought you meant you were quitting.

00:23:17.131 --> 00:23:20.672

- Yeah.

275

Lots and lots of rest.

277
00:23:24.682 --> 00:23:26.323
You're so insincere.

278

Writer Park.

279
00:23:31.693 --> 00:23:34.031
I really do respect you,
Writer Park.

280
00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:35.870
And I wanted to help you,
if only a little--

281
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.743
Help me?
Yeah, right!

282
00:23:37.743 --> 00:23:40.557
It's not like this was volunteer work!
You got paid for what you did!

283
00:23:40.557 --> 00:23:43.814
Your attitude toward your work
is already skewed!

284
00:23:45.182 --> 00:23:49.310
Also, how could you ask for a day off
when the show is on the air?

285
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.669
Huh?

286
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:54.194
Do you take me for a fool because the
director said the same thing as you?

287
00:23:54.194 --> 00:23:55.606
Well, do you?

288
00:23:55.606 --> 00:23:57.095
No.

289
00:23:57.095 --> 00:23:59.766
You act like you're kind,
thoughtful, and hard-working.

290
00:23:59.766 --> 00:24:03.618
It really pisses me off thinking
about how nice I was to you

291
00:24:03.618 --> 00:24:05.270
because I fell for that act!

292
00:24:06.089 --> 00:24:10.473
I've never met someone as wicked as you
in my 10 years of being a writer.

293
00:24:10.473 --> 00:24:12.208
You want to become a writer?

294
00:24:12.208 --> 00:24:14.172
Yeah, you probably will become one.

295
00:24:14.172 --> 00:24:18.761
It's rude bitches like you who always
succeed in this industry!

296
00:24:18.761 --> 00:24:21.646
It'd be weird if you didn't succeed,
since you're a terrible person!

297
00:24:21.646 --> 00:24:23.828
I... I...

298
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:26.397
I was inconsiderate.

299
00:24:27.262 --> 00:24:30.932
I didn't want to stay away, but I
thought you wouldn't want to see me...

300
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.954
since the director said the same thing
about the script as I did

301
00:24:33.954 --> 00:24:36.066
and I thought that upset you.

302
00:24:36.066 --> 00:24:38.458
Blah, blah, blah.

303
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.211
It's always the liars who
have so much to say.

304
00:24:42.211 --> 00:24:43.636

305
00:24:43.636 --> 00:24:45.541
Don't let the door
hit you on the way out.

306
00:24:45.541 --> 00:24:47.415
I won't speak ill of you.

307
00:24:47.415 --> 00:24:49.636
You did work under me
for a year, after all.

308
00:25:01.289 --> 00:25:03.082
Did you go for a workout?

309
00:25:03.082 --> 00:25:05.530
I made you some food.

310
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.100
I flexed my cooking chops
for the first time in a while.

311
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.297
But it's been a while since I've cooked,
so I can't guarantee that it'll be good.

312
00:26:02.589 --> 00:26:04.841

<i>"I have to see Jung Seon."</i>

315
00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:19.295
<i>I only knew later,
after much time had passed...</i>

316
00:26:21.155 --> 00:26:24.375
<i>that the man I'd thought of
in my most desperate moment...</i>

317
00:26:25.707 --> 00:26:27.332
<i>was someone I was in love with.</i>

318
00:26:41.189 --> 00:26:42.538
Give me money.

319
00:26:43.465 --> 00:26:45.438
I have to pay the people
I hired to find you.

320
00:26:46.089 --> 00:26:50.204
It was hard for me to find you alone
after you got rid of your phone.

321
00:26:50.835 --> 00:26:52.370
Who told you to look for me?

322
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.968
I got rid of my cell phone to hide from
you. You should've stopped looking.

323
00:26:54.968 --> 00:26:56.272
So why did you look for me?

324
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.127
How could I not look
for my own child?

325
00:27:05.127 --> 00:27:07.798
You're so precious to me!

326
00:27:07.798 --> 00:27:09.099
Stop it.

327
00:27:09.099 --> 00:27:11.772
Someone would think that you were
an amazing mom if they heard you.

328
00:27:11.772 --> 00:27:14.384
I'm tired of cleaning up your messes.

329
00:27:14.384 --> 00:27:16.563
Let's live apart from one another.
Let's live separately.

330
00:27:16.563 --> 00:27:18.189
You can't do that to me!
I'm your mom!

331
00:27:18.189 --> 00:27:19.644
You'll be punished for such
a terrible moral transgression!

332
00:27:19.644 --> 00:27:22.696
I... don't want you
to be punished!

333
00:27:22.696 --> 00:27:23.960
I'll accept the punishment.

334
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.966
Being with you feels like
a punishment anyway.

335
00:27:29.189 --> 00:27:31.713
Oh my gosh.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

336
00:27:31.713 --> 00:27:33.970
I must have gone insane.
Are you okay?

337
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.172
Stop it.

338
00:27:35.172 --> 00:27:36.512
Get out of my house.

339
00:27:36.512 --> 00:27:38.741
Don't be here when I get back.

340
00:27:52.939 --> 00:27:54.214
Which wench is it?

341
00:27:54.647 --> 00:27:57.108
Which wench made you like this?

342
00:27:57.108 --> 00:28:00.303
Stop it.
Stop it, damn it!

343
00:28:00.303 --> 00:28:02.647
Why, do you feel guilty?

344
00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:04.398
I saw your face last night.

345
00:28:04.398 --> 00:28:06.054
You looked like all of your wishes
had been fulfilled.

346
00:28:06.054 --> 00:28:07.491
Do you like that wench that much?

347
00:28:07.491 --> 00:28:09.601
Why are you bringing someone else
into this conversation?

348
00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:11.985
And then you saw me, and you
looked as if you'd eaten shit.

349
00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:13.723
You ignored me,
and trampled me!

350
00:28:13.723 --> 00:28:15.848
How could a child treat
their mom like that?

351
00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.244
This is so difficult.
This is so difficult!

352
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:29.102
This is so difficult.
I can't live anymore.

353
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.678
I know that I messed up.

354
00:28:32.678 --> 00:28:35.386
But still, you can't
do this to me.

355
00:28:35.386 --> 00:28:37.924
You know what kind of
life I've had!

356
00:28:38.597 --> 00:28:41.265
I'd rather die than live without you.

357
00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.768
I want to die.

358
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.374
Can you kill me, please?

359
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.537
<i>I must see Hyun Soo.
See Hyun Soo.</i>

360
00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:29.095
<i>I know why I want to see
Hyun Soo at this very moment.</i>
