00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:09.326
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:10.460
Where are you right now?

3
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.996
Of course I'm in the library.

4
00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:14.264
I have a bad feeling.

5
00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:18.435
Your dad called to ask if I got you
a studio apartment.

6
00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:21.171
When I said I didn't,
he said he'll check now.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.474
What?

8
00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:27.310
Myung Rang's studio apartment?

9
00:00:27.878 --> 00:00:29.312
My goodness.

10
00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:34.451
Mok Sin told me you got her...

11
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.154
a studio apartment for her to
get prepared for job interviews.

12
00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.359
It's strange.

13
00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:46.396
It's very strange.

14
00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:48.799
Help me, Mom.

15
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.768
Since you're closer, stop Dad
from meeting Myung Rang.

16
00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.808
Sir, please hurry up.

17
00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:59.943
My life depends on it.
Please drive faster.

18
00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:07.350
The receiver cannot pick up your
call. Please leave a message.

19
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.053
Why won't she pick up?

20
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.656
I keep growing a mustache.

21
00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:14.091
I should thread it out.

22
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.628
Is my honey already here?

23
00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:25.335
Why is she bothering me when I'm
trying to date after a long time?

24
00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.504
Sorry, stop bothering me.

25
00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:30.907
Should I shave it off?

26
00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:34.277
Art Villa.

27
00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:36.980
He said she's living at Art Villa.

28
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:40.283
Art Villa. There it is.

29
00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:46.189
(Art Villa)

30
00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:10.347
Oh, my. Wait a minute.

31
00:02:10.347 --> 00:02:13.283
Wait a minute. Wait for me!

32
00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.055
Couldn't they spare
just a few minutes?

33
00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:24.461
Mok Shin likes undercooked noodles.

34
00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:26.163
What should I make him today?

35
00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.168
I'm going to get married
before I eat all of this.

36
00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:37.974
Mok Shin is so impatient.

37
00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:39.676
Okay, honey.

38
00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:45.749
- Hello, ma'am.
- Myung Rang,

39
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.151
we don't have time. Let's go.

40
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:49.853
Why? Did war break out?

41
00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:52.155
I'll explain later. Let's go. Hurry.

42
00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:54.591
I need to cook ramyeon for Mok Sin.

43
00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.260
What is wrong with you?

44
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:00.297
I need to do something important.

45
00:03:00.297 --> 00:03:02.465
- I'll explain later.
- Gosh.

46
00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:04.801
I need to cook for Mok Sin.

47
00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:07.604
He's already on the third floor.

48
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.206
- Hurry.
- What's happening?

49
00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:12.075
Mok Sin is about to come.

50
00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.270
Isn't that Ru Ri's dad?

51
00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:43.974
This all happened because of you.

52
00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:46.209
It hurts.

53
00:03:57.954 --> 00:04:00.457
The room number is 510.

54
00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:03.126
Okay.

55
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.869
If I see who lives here,

56
00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:16.806
I'll find out what is happening.

57
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.653
- Ru Ri.
- Ru Ri.

58
00:04:29.653 --> 00:04:31.755
What's happening right now?

59
00:04:31.755 --> 00:04:33.523
Why is your dad here?

60
00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.026
Is he here to catch me because
I went on your blind date?

61
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.327
Is that right? What should I do?

62
00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:38.461
Mom, what should we do?

63
00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:40.830
Did you think
you would never get caught?

64
00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:44.134
What are you going to do? Dad will
be waiting in front of the door.

65
00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:47.470
I'm not here as of this moment.
Goodbye.

66
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.839
How could you be so disloyal
and leave like that?

67
00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:51.474
Loyalty isn't important right now.

68
00:04:51.474 --> 00:04:54.144
Do me a favor, and take
all the blame for me.

69
00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:56.713
Ma'am, take care.

70
00:04:57.013 --> 00:05:00.517
- What about your honey, Mok Sin?
- I forgot about him.

71
00:05:00.517 --> 00:05:03.653
What should I do?
I left my phone. Give me your phone.

72
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.021
- Hurry.
- Here.

73
00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:11.528
- Hello?
- Mok Sin.

74
00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:13.096
Thank goodness.

75
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.700
This is my friend's phone.
Where are you?

76
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.269
Couldn't you wait?

77
00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:21.137
I'm on my way. I'm in the elevator.

78
00:05:21.137 --> 00:05:23.640
No, don't come. You can't come.
Don't come.

79
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.776
- An emergency happened.
- I'm already here.

80
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.445
Just boil the water for ramyeon.

81
00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:32.015
Mok Sin? Honey?

82
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.652
What should we do?
He's already here.

83
00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:37.721
- What should we do?
- I don't know either.

84
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:40.323
Didn't you prepare for this when you
decided to do something like that?

85
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.892
This is not the time to say
something like that.

86
00:05:42.892 --> 00:05:44.661
Please go up there,

87
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.263
and handle Ru Ri's dad. I beg you.

88
00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.566
If Mok Sin finds out,
I'll be in trouble.

89
00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:51.768
(Dad)

90
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:52.902
It's your old man.

91
00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:55.105
I mean, your dad.

92
00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:56.906
Mom.

93
00:05:58.708 --> 00:05:59.909
I can't believe this.

94
00:06:01.077 --> 00:06:02.779
What are you going to do?

95
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.148
Dad and that guy are about to meet.

96
00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:06.383
Mom, please help me.

97
00:06:06.383 --> 00:06:08.518
He's going to kill me
if he finds out.

98
00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:11.221
There's only one way.

99
00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:13.256
Here, call him.

100
00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:22.399
I heard you were adopted
when you were six years old.

101
00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:24.601
You came back home after 46 years.

102
00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:27.570
I wanted to treat you
to a warm meal.

103
00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.141
I'll take this away.

104
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.275
There's no need for that.

105
00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.012
This is a priceless meal that was
prepared for me. I should eat it.

106
00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:46.389
Does it fit your taste?

107
00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:50.093
He said the correct answer.

108
00:06:51.094 --> 00:06:53.096
A good memory is the best taste.

109
00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:59.035
I can't forget the day I left
to the US to be adopted.

110
00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:03.206
We were hungry, but we only had
doenjang sauce and boiled barley.

111
00:07:04.207 --> 00:07:05.642
For the first time in my life,

112
00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:10.079
I had white rice with a fried egg.

113
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.215
He's very considerate.

114
00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:17.387
On top of that, he's very smart.

115
00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:19.823
To survive in this industry,

116
00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:22.659
he has to cook the food
his clients want...

117
00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.595
instead of the food
he wants to cook.

118
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.965
He has already realized that.

119
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.471
Does that mean
Jung Tae Yang is good enough...

120
00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:36.206
to be your successor?

121
00:07:37.273 --> 00:07:38.875
I need to keep an eye on him.

122
00:07:40.844 --> 00:07:43.213
What about your daughter
in Jeju Island?

123
00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:46.316
If Ae Ri wants to
inherit the company,

124
00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:48.451
she must compete for the position
just like everyone else.

125
00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:51.654
A successor? Is that true?

126
00:07:51.654 --> 00:07:54.891
Yes, that's why I'm asking
Jung Do to work for me.

127
00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:57.093
When Chairman Kevin retires
from the post,

128
00:07:57.093 --> 00:07:59.195
he said he's going to select his
successor among the employees.

129
00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:01.598
But Jung Do isn't listening to me.

130
00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.968
If only he becomes the successor,

131
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:08.004
I'll have the control
of the company in no time.

132
00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:10.640
What's worse is that Jung
Hwa Young's son is involved now.

133
00:08:10.773 --> 00:08:12.275
Things have gotten messier.

134
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.011
Is there a way we can fix this?

135
00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:17.780
First off,

136
00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:21.351
we need to get Jung Tae Yang
out of picture.

137
00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:27.323
- Congratulations on getting a job
- Congratulations on getting a job

138
00:08:27.323 --> 00:08:30.393
- My dear Tae Yang
- My dear Tae Yang

139
00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:33.029
- Congratulations on getting a job
- Congratulations on getting a job

140
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.734
This is so lame.
You didn't have to do this.

141
00:08:37.734 --> 00:08:40.470
Stop lying. You're smiling
from ear to ear.

142
00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.740
But let me ask you one thing.

143
00:08:43.973 --> 00:08:46.576
Are you really going to work
at SC Food and Beverage?

144
00:08:46.743 --> 00:08:49.746
Why wouldn't I? It was so hard
for me to get a job there.

145
00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:53.816
What he means is you can get a job
anywhere else with your resume.

146
00:08:53.816 --> 00:08:56.352
I got it. Isn't it because
of that scary grandma?

147
00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:58.588
What do you mean? Who's the
scary grandma?

148
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:09.566
- Hello?
- This is Choi Sun Young.

149
00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:13.836
Yes, what is this regarding?

150
00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:16.839
I need to talk to you. Come
to the cafe in front of your house.

151
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.974
Right now?

152
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:19.742
Who is it?

153
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.614
Are you stupid enough to tell
Jung Do who's calling you?

154
00:09:24.948 --> 00:09:26.749
Okay.

155
00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.588
I need to teach a class now.

156
00:09:31.588 --> 00:09:32.922
That was sudden.

157
00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:36.459
- See you later.
- Okay.

158
00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:51.474
- Give me. Give me what I asked.
- What you asked me?

159
00:09:51.474 --> 00:09:53.343
The guy who was digging
Hwa Young's past.

160
00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.345
Give me his contact.

161
00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.447
Oh, no. What should I do?

162
00:09:57.447 --> 00:10:00.216
I had the business card, but I can't
find it. I looked everywhere.

163
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:03.052
- You moron.
- Come on.

164
00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:04.854
There you go with your temper.

165
00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:07.991
Use that hand
to hold your cards only.

166
00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:11.361
You brat. Do you know
how much I can make from this?

167
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.796
You said he seemed
like he was pretty rich.

168
00:10:14.063 --> 00:10:16.199
Right. I remember it now.

169
00:10:16.566 --> 00:10:18.101
On the business card,

170
00:10:18.334 --> 00:10:21.337
it said that he was
from SC Food and Beverage.

171
00:10:24.073 --> 00:10:25.241
What is his name?

172
00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:26.442
His name was...

173
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.579
I can't remember.

174
00:10:30.947 --> 00:10:32.949
His last name was Kim.

175
00:10:33.249 --> 00:10:35.551
Why don't you just
go to the company?

176
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:38.087
Do you want me to look like a fool?

177
00:10:38.087 --> 00:10:41.190
A lot of people must have the same
last name at the company.

178
00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:44.961
You're driving me crazy.

179
00:10:44.961 --> 00:10:48.331
I'd be a fool not to play cards
at the table tonight.

180
00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:50.800
Where can I get the money?

181
00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:53.102
Are you still gambling?

182
00:10:53.102 --> 00:10:55.805
Please stop gambling.

183
00:10:55.805 --> 00:10:57.073
Jung Hwa Young.

184
00:10:58.307 --> 00:11:01.110
That's right. She has her
past relationship to blame.

185
00:11:02.979 --> 00:11:04.580
What is it that you want
to talk about?

186
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.583
I have a class soon. Please hurry.

187
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.421
Because Jung Do is staying
with you now, do you think...

188
00:11:11.454 --> 00:11:13.056
he'll stay with you forever?

189
00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:15.958
Don't kid yourself.
My son has high standards.

190
00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:18.828
He's just playing
with a used toy like you.

191
00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:21.431
If that was the point of this,
you came to the wrong person.

192
00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.701
If you want to take your son away,
tell him that yourself.

193
00:11:24.701 --> 00:11:27.070
But no one will understand you
for pretending to be his mother...

194
00:11:27.537 --> 00:11:29.806
after he has grown up already.

195
00:11:29.806 --> 00:11:33.576
What? Don't you know who I am?

196
00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.878
I am Jung Do's mother.

197
00:11:35.878 --> 00:11:39.048
You ought to beg on your knees.
How dare you...

198
00:11:39.048 --> 00:11:41.818
If you wanted to be treated like his
mom, you should've done your duty.

199
00:11:42.585 --> 00:11:44.187
I'll get going.

200
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:46.823
I guess you decided to go berserk.

201
00:11:46.823 --> 00:11:50.093
There's no point or reason for me...

202
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.961
to listen to you.

203
00:11:55.932 --> 00:11:56.999
Sit.

204
00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:00.570
Old lady, sit down.

205
00:12:03.072 --> 00:12:05.041
Do you want to kill your own son?

206
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:11.180
He just turned 30.

207
00:12:11.214 --> 00:12:13.216
Wouldn't it be a shame
for him to end his life now?

208
00:12:15.718 --> 00:12:16.853
What do you mean?

209
00:12:16.853 --> 00:12:20.723
I came to put you in your place
as it seems you have forgotten it.

210
00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:22.625
You'd better figure this out right.

211
00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:24.427
It's not the time for you...

212
00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:26.996
to be happy just because
you son got a job.

213
00:12:29.365 --> 00:12:31.501
I asked what you meant by that.

214
00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.669
You told me to
do my duty as a mother.

215
00:12:34.103 --> 00:12:36.672
Is your relationship with your son
not good like mine?

216
00:12:37.607 --> 00:12:41.310
If you've been paying attention
to him, you should've understood me.

217
00:12:41.878 --> 00:12:44.881
Tell me. What did my son do?

218
00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:49.552
You know...

219
00:12:49.552 --> 00:12:51.554
he fell down the stairs
in the second round, don't you?

220
00:12:51.721 --> 00:12:53.956
In the final round, he was
locked inside the freezer...

221
00:12:53.956 --> 00:12:56.692
and was transported
to the emergency medical center.

222
00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:58.694
You didn't know that?

223
00:12:59.829 --> 00:13:01.430
What?

224
00:13:02.465 --> 00:13:03.733
So you're telling me...

225
00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:06.202
that you were behind all of this?

226
00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:09.872
Then do you think those misfortunes
happened to him coincidentally?

227
00:13:09.939 --> 00:13:11.440
Two misfortunes in a row?

228
00:13:13.943 --> 00:13:14.944
Why?

229
00:13:15.945 --> 00:13:17.046
Will you splash it on me?

230
00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:19.549
Even if your love life was messy,

231
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.184
and you got married three times,

232
00:13:21.184 --> 00:13:23.452
you want to be polite
since I'm Jung Do's birth mother?

233
00:13:23.853 --> 00:13:26.823
If you have a bit of conscience,
stop standing in my way,

234
00:13:26.823 --> 00:13:29.292
and get rid of Jung Tae Yang
from my company.

235
00:13:34.096 --> 00:13:35.998
Let me warn you loud and clear.

236
00:13:36.599 --> 00:13:38.467
When I put my mind to it,
I follow through.

237
00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:39.702
You know, don't you?

238
00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:45.074
I even killed my own son.

239
00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:47.176
Do you think I can't kill yours?

240
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.478
Unless you want your son to die...

241
00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:56.452
Let me warn you too.

242
00:13:58.187 --> 00:13:59.355
If you want to,

243
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:01.591
try it.

244
00:14:02.325 --> 00:14:03.926
Just like you said,

245
00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:06.295
since I had a lot of men in my life
and got married three times,

246
00:14:06.462 --> 00:14:08.631
your threat doesn't scare
me one bit.

247
00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.935
Is that so? Are you saying
even if your son...

248
00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:16.005
And since my son grew up
watching me,

249
00:14:16.873 --> 00:14:18.574
he's just as strong.

250
00:14:19.075 --> 00:14:22.245
So don't make a rash move.

251
00:14:22.245 --> 00:14:25.815
Starting now, if you touch
a strand of my son's hair,

252
00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:28.451
I won't let you off.

253
00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:30.486
Understood?

254
00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.058
Hey, stop right there.

255
00:14:38.361 --> 00:14:40.863
Goodness, why isn't she picking up?

256
00:14:40.863 --> 00:14:42.665
I have to go and gamble.

257
00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.838
Come here. Come here!

258
00:14:49.405 --> 00:14:50.573
Let go of me.

259
00:14:53.342 --> 00:14:55.211
What's going on?
Is that Jung Hwa Young?

260
00:14:58.347 --> 00:14:59.916
Where are you, Mr. Kim?

261
00:14:59.916 --> 00:15:00.917
Mr. Kim?

262
00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:02.585
On the business card,

263
00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:05.354
it said that he was
from SC Food and Beverage.

264
00:15:05.354 --> 00:15:07.356
His last name was Kim.

265
00:15:14.964 --> 00:15:15.998
Taxi!

266
00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.167
Sir, I'll double your fee.

267
00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:20.603
Follow the vehicle
with the plate number, 1739.

268
00:15:20.603 --> 00:15:22.204
Come on. Speed up.

269
00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:24.040
Jung Hwa Young.

270
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.842
I'll make you regret.

271
00:15:32.715 --> 00:15:33.816
Lee Ru Ri!

272
00:15:34.083 --> 00:15:36.585
Ru Ri! Ru Ri!

273
00:15:37.219 --> 00:15:38.821
What is this regarding?

274
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.192
Who are you?

275
00:15:43.292 --> 00:15:44.593
Who are you?

276
00:15:46.729 --> 00:15:48.464
I asked you first.

277
00:15:48.464 --> 00:15:49.598
Who are you?

278
00:15:49.598 --> 00:15:52.234
I'm the boyfriend
of the girl who lives here.

279
00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:54.070
Is that so?

280
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.872
Who is the girl that lives here?

281
00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:58.674
Who on earth are you?

282
00:15:58.674 --> 00:16:00.076
Goodness!

283
00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.345
Hey! I'm older than you!

284
00:16:05.247 --> 00:16:06.315
Hold on.

285
00:16:06.682 --> 00:16:08.184
He went to an engineering school,
and he's a promising...

286
00:16:08.184 --> 00:16:09.685
assistant manager at the Korea
Expressway Corporation.

287
00:16:10.953 --> 00:16:14.223
I see. Aren't you Oh Mok Sin?

288
00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:17.126
Aren't you Oh Dong Ki's son, the
oriental medicine clinic's owner?

289
00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:19.228
Yes, I am. Who are you, sir?

290
00:16:20.596 --> 00:16:22.698
I'm Ru Ri's dad.

291
00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:25.201
Sorry? Oh, you are?

292
00:16:25.201 --> 00:16:26.469
Let me introduce myself.

293
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.941
Is this Ru Ri's studio apartment?

294
00:16:31.941 --> 00:16:33.442
You didn't know?

295
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:36.345
We had ramyeon twice here.

296
00:16:37.346 --> 00:16:38.447
I see.

297
00:16:38.714 --> 00:16:42.852
You're certain that this is
Ru Ri's studio apartment, right?

298
00:16:42.852 --> 00:16:46.322
Yes, I've been helping her with her
job searching here.

299
00:16:46.322 --> 00:16:48.591
I came here again to help her
prepare for interviews.

300
00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:50.793
Is that so?

301
00:16:51.927 --> 00:16:54.463
So Won said he got a second house.

302
00:16:54.463 --> 00:16:55.998
This must be the place then.

303
00:16:57.299 --> 00:16:59.735
I don't think she's inside
right now.

304
00:16:59.735 --> 00:17:02.038
Wait for her here then.

305
00:17:02.038 --> 00:17:05.808
Obviously,
focus on your studies first.

306
00:17:06.308 --> 00:17:08.811
By the way,

307
00:17:09.512 --> 00:17:11.781
why did you say...

308
00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:14.650
that my daughter's eyes are small?

309
00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:18.087
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:20.923
I've never seen someone who had
smaller eyes than myself.

311
00:17:22.024 --> 00:17:25.127
What? She has
smaller eyes than yours?

312
00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.374
Have you taken
any photos with my daughter?

313
00:17:38.374 --> 00:17:42.278
She pestered me so much,
so we took photos last week.

314
00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:44.313
Here.

315
00:17:45.181 --> 00:17:48.050
This is too small. It's hard to see.

316
00:17:49.418 --> 00:17:50.586
Wait a minute.

317
00:17:52.054 --> 00:17:54.623
- Yes.
- Are you the car owner of 8612?

318
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.125
Could you move your car?

319
00:17:56.292 --> 00:17:57.593
Okay, I'll go.

320
00:17:58.094 --> 00:18:00.229
I'm sorry, I have to move my car.

321
00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:01.430
Okay.

322
00:18:16.045 --> 00:18:17.980
Mom, what should I tell him?

323
00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.248
Why are you asking me that?

324
00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:20.783
You should say it.

325
00:18:20.783 --> 00:18:22.618
It's better for an elder to say it.

326
00:18:22.618 --> 00:18:24.920
I'm already embarrassed
for doing this much.

327
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.322
I'm going to go. You're on your own.

328
00:18:26.322 --> 00:18:28.190
- He's here.
- What?

329
00:18:32.128 --> 00:18:33.429
Mr. Oh Mok Sin!

330
00:18:35.297 --> 00:18:36.365
Who are you?

331
00:18:41.504 --> 00:18:43.539
I'm the real Lee Ru Ri.

332
00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:47.109
My dad wanted me to go
on a blind date.

333
00:18:47.109 --> 00:18:50.279
But I sent my friend,
Lee Myung Rang instead.

334
00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:52.648
That means your girlfriend...

335
00:18:52.648 --> 00:18:55.584
is my friend Myung Rang, not me.

336
00:18:55.584 --> 00:18:57.520
Wait a minute.

337
00:18:57.786 --> 00:18:59.455
I don't know
what you're talking about.

338
00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:00.789
Mok Sin, my honey.

339
00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:02.324
That's her.

340
00:19:07.163 --> 00:19:08.297
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:08.597 --> 00:19:11.333
In short,
I went on the blind date...

342
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.636
instead of her.

343
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.005
This big-eyed person is Lee Ru Ri.

344
00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.741
This cute small-eyed person
is Lee Myung Rang.

345
00:19:20.476 --> 00:19:23.879
I'm really sorry. I didn't know
things would get this big.

346
00:19:24.113 --> 00:19:26.549
Anyway, my dad should never
find out about this.

347
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:28.350
Please help us.

348
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.388
Just tell him that she is Ru Ri,
not Myung Rang.

349
00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:34.356
That's right, my honey.

350
00:19:34.356 --> 00:19:37.293
It doesn't matter if I'm Ru Ri or
Myung Rang. My love is the same.

351
00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.097
I've never seen such a crazy pair.

352
00:19:42.164 --> 00:19:44.266
I feel awful.

353
00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:47.036
You guys are telling me that
you fooled me.

354
00:19:47.036 --> 00:19:48.637
How dare you!

355
00:19:48.804 --> 00:19:51.840
We didn't do that on purpose.

356
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.075
- Hey, Big-eye.
- Yes?

357
00:19:53.075 --> 00:19:55.344
Put up your guard,
I think I'm going to punch you.

358
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:57.580
- Small-eye!
- Yes?

359
00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.116
I'm warning you. If I see
your face one more time,

360
00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:03.118
I'm going to bury you in the ground.

361
00:20:03.552 --> 00:20:06.088
Both of you are ugly like gukbap.

362
00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:15.464
Ru Ri, what does he mean?

363
00:20:15.598 --> 00:20:17.866
He means we're both way too ugly.

364
00:20:17.866 --> 00:20:19.568
But how could he...

365
00:20:19.568 --> 00:20:23.205
How could someone be like that?

366
00:20:23.205 --> 00:20:24.506
You're right.

367
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.575
Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder.

368
00:20:26.575 --> 00:20:28.110
Just consider yourself unlucky.

369
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:30.079
That's right.

370
00:20:30.379 --> 00:20:34.049
It's your dad's fault to bring him
as your future husband.

371
00:20:34.083 --> 00:20:36.585
We forgot about dad.
Mom, what should we do?

372
00:20:36.585 --> 00:20:37.853
I can't believe this.

373
00:20:39.054 --> 00:20:41.690
I'm choosing friendship over love.

374
00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.426
I'll handle this. You two can go.

375
00:20:44.793 --> 00:20:46.028
- What are you going to do?
- What are you going to do?

376
00:20:48.097 --> 00:20:50.165
I'm good at handling men.

377
00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:51.800
I'll be back.

378
00:20:52.935 --> 00:20:56.272
Go, Myung Rang. Please do your best.

379
00:20:57.139 --> 00:20:58.841
- I need to talk to you.
- What?

380
00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:04.413
Why is it taking him so long
to move his car?

381
00:21:10.552 --> 00:21:12.054
Sir, do you live here?

382
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:14.256
You have a package.

383
00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:18.294
Excuse me, I don't live here.

384
00:21:19.595 --> 00:21:20.729
What is this?

385
00:21:25.134 --> 00:21:26.368
Lee Myung Rang?

386
00:21:28.003 --> 00:21:29.071
Wait a minute.

387
00:21:30.139 --> 00:21:35.077
Isn't she Ru Ri's friend?

388
00:21:38.347 --> 00:21:39.615
The man from the blind date.

389
00:21:39.915 --> 00:21:41.583
Oh Mok Sin, who works at
Korea Expressway Corporation.

390
00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:44.320
I've never seen someone who had
smaller eyes than myself.

391
00:21:52.428 --> 00:21:56.565
Dong Ki, I heard that Mok Sin and
Ru Ri took some photos.

392
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:57.833
Send them if you have them.

393
00:21:59.134 --> 00:22:00.602
(Send me Mok Sin and
Ru RI's photos.)

394
00:22:07.109 --> 00:22:09.545
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:22:09.778 --> 00:22:11.146
What will you do?

396
00:22:11.347 --> 00:22:12.748
You were never in trouble
while growing up.

397
00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:16.585
Are you going to cause trouble now
and make me worried to death?

398
00:22:16.652 --> 00:22:18.587
Mom, it hurts.

399
00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:20.756
I'm slapping you as a punishment.

400
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.926
Even if we manage to get out
of this situation,

401
00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:26.595
what will you do if he finds out?

402
00:22:26.662 --> 00:22:28.997
It's not something
to be angry about.

403
00:22:28.997 --> 00:22:31.066
It's something to celebrate.

404
00:22:31.367 --> 00:22:33.569
- What did you say?
- Think about it.

405
00:22:33.569 --> 00:22:36.338
If I married that brat, Oh Mok Sin,

406
00:22:36.338 --> 00:22:38.640
he would've been your son-in-law.
What would you do then?

407
00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:42.578
Since Myung Rang and I did this,
we found out about him earlier.

408
00:22:42.578 --> 00:22:45.280
We were lucky enough to avoid
a brat like him.

409
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.150
Oh, my. Are you serious?

410
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.653
Will your dad think like that after
hearing this and be forgiving?

411
00:22:52.354 --> 00:22:55.357
I have something else
to persuade him.

412
00:22:55.357 --> 00:22:57.526
What's gotten into you?

413
00:22:57.826 --> 00:22:58.927
What is it?

414
00:22:59.027 --> 00:23:01.230
I'll tell you properly later.

415
00:23:02.364 --> 00:23:06.301
Mom, today's a really good day.
It's a lucky day.

416
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:07.369
What?

417
00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:10.739
The universe is helping me now.

418
00:23:10.739 --> 00:23:13.041
We'll manage to handle
this situation.

419
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:16.011
Don't worry, and get some rest.

420
00:23:16.011 --> 00:23:19.114
- See you later.
- Hey, Ru Ri.

421
00:23:20.082 --> 00:23:21.984
Where on earth are you going?

422
00:23:21.984 --> 00:23:24.119
- Work.
- Work?

423
00:23:26.355 --> 00:23:27.923
What are you talking about?

424
00:23:38.767 --> 00:23:40.335
(Mok Sin and Ru Ri forever)

425
00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:52.214
Goodness. Hello, sir.

426
00:23:52.414 --> 00:23:53.849
Why are you here?

427
00:23:54.116 --> 00:23:55.584
Are you here to see Ru Ri?

428
00:23:55.584 --> 00:23:57.753
Ru Ri and I share this place
together to study.

429
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:02.724
(Mok Sin and Ru Ri forever)

430
00:24:05.894 --> 00:24:08.997
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

431
00:24:22.077 --> 00:24:25.047
When I put my mind to it,
I follow through.

432
00:24:25.347 --> 00:24:29.551
I even killed my own son.

433
00:24:29.618 --> 00:24:31.687
Do you think I can't kill yours?

434
00:24:35.023 --> 00:24:37.292
Why, did someone die?

435
00:24:37.526 --> 00:24:39.628
I already told you,
let's not think about money.

436
00:24:40.095 --> 00:24:41.630
People who love money...

437
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.100
- can't love people.
- Do something about your mother.

438
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.269
Did you meet her earlier?

439
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:49.838
I didn't want to worry you,
but I can't help it.

440
00:24:49.838 --> 00:24:51.406
Tae Yang's life is in danger.

441
00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:52.508
What are you talking about?

442
00:24:52.508 --> 00:24:54.643
She shoved him down the stairs.

443
00:24:54.643 --> 00:24:58.247
She also locked him up in the fridge
so he had to go to the hospital.

444
00:24:58.247 --> 00:24:59.648
Did she say that?

445
00:24:59.648 --> 00:25:03.051
She wants me to make him quit
to save his life.

446
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:07.322
What a crazy woman. She's crazy.

447
00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:09.591
What are you going to do?

448
00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:12.594
I'm going to see her boss and
tell him what she really is like.

449
00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:14.830
She's too meticulous to leave
any evidence.

450
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.465
I can't believe this!

451
00:25:19.835 --> 00:25:22.504
First, let's make him quit.

452
00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:26.008
There's no reason for Tae Yang
to endure this over there.

453
00:25:26.008 --> 00:25:27.376
Stop him going to work.

454
00:25:27.976 --> 00:25:29.578
I know why now.

455
00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:33.749
I thought something was strange.

456
00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:36.084
I felt someone shove
me down the stairs.

457
00:25:36.084 --> 00:25:38.086
The fridge door was also open.

458
00:25:38.554 --> 00:25:42.224
This will continue as long as
you work with her.

459
00:25:42.224 --> 00:25:43.759
What does she want?

460
00:25:43.825 --> 00:25:45.427
She wants us to get divorced.

461
00:25:45.928 --> 00:25:47.095
What?

462
00:25:47.095 --> 00:25:49.031
There's no reason to
sacrifice yourself.

463
00:25:49.097 --> 00:25:52.301
I'll find a job for you.
Let's just give up.

464
00:25:52.434 --> 00:25:54.236
I pretended to not care,

465
00:25:54.236 --> 00:25:56.638
but let's just give up.

466
00:25:58.073 --> 00:26:00.909
Mom, I'm a man.

467
00:26:01.543 --> 00:26:03.745
I'm born to not give up.

468
00:26:04.613 --> 00:26:06.248
My whole life is on that company.

469
00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:08.884
It strangely felt like destiny.

470
00:26:09.685 --> 00:26:11.753
Meeting Chairman Kevin in Bali...

471
00:26:12.154 --> 00:26:14.022
and Ru Ri being my assistant
felt like destiny.

472
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.926
I think it's a sign to stop
wandering and settle down.

473
00:26:17.926 --> 00:26:19.728
- Tae Yang.
- Dad.

474
00:26:20.596 --> 00:26:21.830
Do you love mom?

475
00:26:23.065 --> 00:26:26.234
Then protect her, not me.

476
00:26:26.902 --> 00:26:29.004
I'm not going to let this happen
for the third time...

477
00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:31.306
because I know
who my opponent is now.

478
00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:35.010
I'll come home after dinner.

479
00:26:35.544 --> 00:26:36.645
Tae Yang.

480
00:26:37.546 --> 00:26:40.015
It's my first day of work.
I'll be back later.

481
00:26:41.116 --> 00:26:42.317
Wish me luck.

482
00:27:10.078 --> 00:27:12.347
(SC Food and Beverage)

483
00:27:27.596 --> 00:27:29.598
Excuse me, hold the elevator.

484
00:27:34.102 --> 00:27:37.506
All right. So your office
is on the third floor.

485
00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:42.244
Can we have a talk?

486
00:27:44.479 --> 00:27:46.214
I'm the Chief of Food Laboratory.

487
00:27:46.214 --> 00:27:48.083
Did you let a peddler
into the company?

488
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.751
Come on.

489
00:27:50.018 --> 00:27:51.186
Don't you want to?

490
00:27:51.186 --> 00:27:54.489
I have so many things I want to
share with you about Jung Hwa Young.

491
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:03.231
Don't worry. I will go there...

492
00:28:03.231 --> 00:28:05.534
and either threaten or beg her
not to hurt...

493
00:28:05.534 --> 00:28:06.935
Tae Yang again.

494
00:28:07.035 --> 00:28:08.570
Do you think that will work?

495
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:09.838
Then what should we do?

496
00:28:09.838 --> 00:28:11.907
Should we stop Tae Yang
from getting employed?

497
00:28:11.907 --> 00:28:14.543
Both Choi Sun Young and Tae Yang...

498
00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:17.546
won't listen to us.

499
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.083
There is only one way to
protect Tae Yang.

500
00:28:22.284 --> 00:28:24.586
What is it? Tell me.

501
00:28:24.653 --> 00:28:26.888
I will do everything
I can do to help.

502
00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:28.824
We should...

503
00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:31.660
do as she wants.

504
00:28:32.494 --> 00:28:33.495
What?

505
00:28:33.495 --> 00:28:35.130
Even I'm surprised by my decision.

506
00:28:37.099 --> 00:28:38.734
All my life,

507
00:28:39.735 --> 00:28:42.537
I thought nothing was as precious
to me as my children.

508
00:28:45.774 --> 00:28:48.143
But I don't think I will be able
to break up with you.

509
00:28:49.344 --> 00:28:51.813
If I let you go,
everything will work out.

510
00:28:53.315 --> 00:28:55.884
She won't be able to
do anything to my child.

511
00:28:57.152 --> 00:28:58.520
But I just can't.

512
00:28:59.488 --> 00:29:01.256
I can't let you go.

513
00:29:02.624 --> 00:29:04.226
If I break up with you,

514
00:29:04.926 --> 00:29:07.329
I might never be able to become
happy again.

515
00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:09.664
I want to believe in Tae Yang...

516
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.135
who told me she won't be able
to hurt him again,

517
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:17.606
rather than go back
to the unhappy life I once had.

518
00:29:19.608 --> 00:29:21.276
Do I even deserve to be a mother?

519
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.378
Just promise me one thing.

520
00:29:24.246 --> 00:29:28.049
From now on, however hard
our life gets,

521
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.018
don't run away.

522
00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:32.387
You can be a selfish mother,

523
00:29:33.088 --> 00:29:35.056
but you shouldn't be a coward.

524
00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:38.894
I believe it will work out.

525
00:29:39.995 --> 00:29:41.429
Can you promise me that?

526
00:29:57.345 --> 00:29:58.513
Oh, my.

527
00:29:59.915 --> 00:30:02.484
Tell me.
Start by introducing yourself.

528
00:30:02.484 --> 00:30:04.419
Me? I'm Kim Jin Ho.

529
00:30:04.586 --> 00:30:07.789
I am Jung Hwa Young's ex-husband.

530
00:30:09.758 --> 00:30:12.394
And who are you?

531
00:30:12.828 --> 00:30:14.329
Why do you want to know about her?

532
00:30:14.329 --> 00:30:15.764
You don't need to know.

533
00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:18.500
Tell me everything you know
about that woman.

534
00:30:20.836 --> 00:30:22.103
How much will you pay me?

535
00:30:22.103 --> 00:30:24.339
I'll decide after
you answer my question.

536
00:30:24.339 --> 00:30:25.674
Your company's juice...

537
00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:28.844
tastes delicious.

538
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.382
Thank you for the juice. Gosh.

539
00:30:37.118 --> 00:30:38.954
How much do you want?

540
00:30:39.054 --> 00:30:41.656
Give me your hand. Give it to me.

541
00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:47.062
Send me an adequate amount
of money to this account.

542
00:30:47.896 --> 00:30:48.997
Hey.

543
00:30:59.908 --> 00:31:03.078
Why do you think there is no record
of her before she was 20 years old?

544
00:31:03.245 --> 00:31:04.846
What is the reason?

545
00:31:05.013 --> 00:31:07.349
She wasn't registered...

546
00:31:07.782 --> 00:31:09.918
before she met me.

547
00:31:11.052 --> 00:31:12.387
She wasn't registered?

548
00:31:13.321 --> 00:31:15.357
Does that mean she had no family?

549
00:31:15.357 --> 00:31:18.526
She told me that she escaped from
an orphanage when she was young,

550
00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:21.529
and after that, she wandered around
without being registered.

551
00:31:21.763 --> 00:31:23.765
Who knows what really happened?

552
00:31:23.765 --> 00:31:27.602
She was too smart for a woman
of such background.

553
00:31:27.602 --> 00:31:31.072
She's good at English too.

554
00:31:31.406 --> 00:31:34.843
So she got registered
only after she met you...

555
00:31:34.843 --> 00:31:37.646
when she was 20 years old?

556
00:31:37.646 --> 00:31:39.014
That's right.

557
00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:41.683
I was used by her.

558
00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:45.053
She didn't marry me
because she loved me.

559
00:31:45.053 --> 00:31:47.756
She married me because
she wanted to get registered.

560
00:31:47.889 --> 00:31:50.125
To send her son to school,

561
00:31:50.125 --> 00:31:51.493
she needed to be registered.

562
00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:54.229
That is why she lured me.

563
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.099
She got her identification
after she married me.

564
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.236
So what really happened to her
in the past?

565
00:32:01.236 --> 00:32:03.438
Okay, this is enough.

566
00:32:03.805 --> 00:32:06.875
I will tell you more
after I check the money.

567
00:32:06.875 --> 00:32:09.544
To be continued. See you next time.

568
00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:11.112
Bye.

569
00:32:11.313 --> 00:32:12.314
Hey.

570
00:32:13.081 --> 00:32:14.082
Hey!

571
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.322
She wasn't registered.

572
00:32:21.489 --> 00:32:24.659
What was she trying to hide?

573
00:32:35.403 --> 00:32:37.939
My sister's life was ruined
because of you.

574
00:32:37.939 --> 00:32:41.276
You should take responsibility
to atone now.

575
00:32:44.913 --> 00:32:46.114
What is your name?

576
00:32:46.414 --> 00:32:49.050
It's Su Mi. Jung Su Mi.

577
00:32:49.417 --> 00:32:50.752
How old are you?

578
00:32:50.819 --> 00:32:52.654
I'm the same age as So Won.

579
00:32:52.654 --> 00:32:54.756
I met her when I went volunteering
back in the sophomore year.

580
00:32:55.857 --> 00:32:58.059
Are you in medical school as well?

581
00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:01.930
No, I'm working as a nurse
at a private hospital.

582
00:33:02.664 --> 00:33:04.632
Oh, is that so?

583
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.768
A nurse.

584
00:33:08.603 --> 00:33:10.138
What do your parents do
for a living?

585
00:33:10.138 --> 00:33:12.607
My dad died when I was young.

586
00:33:12.674 --> 00:33:15.076
So I live with my mom
and two younger sisters.

587
00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:19.481
Then you must be
the head of the household.

588
00:33:19.614 --> 00:33:22.550
Yes, but my sisters are kind,
so it's worth it.

589
00:33:25.954 --> 00:33:28.790
Your mom must be so proud you.

590
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.060
Mom, her mom is ill right now.

591
00:33:32.694 --> 00:33:35.797
So I wanted to get engaged to her
before I serve in the army.

592
00:33:35.797 --> 00:33:36.965
Would that be all right?

593
00:33:36.965 --> 00:33:38.233
Engaged?

594
00:33:39.334 --> 00:33:42.103
That's a little too abrupt.

595
00:33:42.103 --> 00:33:44.172
What? Well,

596
00:33:44.372 --> 00:33:46.741
you should get engaged.

597
00:33:47.609 --> 00:33:50.645
If you go to the army, you won't be
able to care for each other as much.

598
00:33:51.046 --> 00:33:53.148
You need to make sure before you go.

599
00:33:53.581 --> 00:33:54.783
Thank you, Father.

600
00:33:55.583 --> 00:33:58.386
See? My father is more
open-minded than you think.

601
00:34:06.094 --> 00:34:08.163
I'm sorry to tell you this,

602
00:34:08.663 --> 00:34:11.366
but I got married last month.
I'm moving to the US.

603
00:34:12.033 --> 00:34:15.270
I got married to someone rich
enough to take care of my sisters.

604
00:34:16.104 --> 00:34:19.307
Let's forget each other
and live happily.

605
00:34:42.363 --> 00:34:45.266
Don't bite your nails.

606
00:34:45.266 --> 00:34:48.103
It's not good for your baby.

607
00:34:52.607 --> 00:34:53.975
Don't shake your legs.

608
00:34:53.975 --> 00:34:55.577
It's won't bring you any luck.

609
00:34:55.577 --> 00:34:57.312
I'm doing this because I'm nervous.

610
00:34:57.312 --> 00:34:58.480
It's driving me insane.

611
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.749
Gosh, I'm going crazy too.

612
00:35:03.017 --> 00:35:05.653
Ms. Ha Yeon Ju, come inside.

613
00:35:08.857 --> 00:35:10.291
We have your test results.

614
00:35:10.291 --> 00:35:12.727
Okay. What does it say, Doctor?

615
00:35:12.727 --> 00:35:14.996
Is it good news or bad news?

616
00:35:14.996 --> 00:35:16.364
It's good news, right?

617
00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:19.534
I had the medicines
as you told me to.

618
00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:21.936
I also exercised and ate good food.

619
00:35:21.936 --> 00:35:24.806
I went to see a fortune teller,
I put marbles on my panties, and...

620
00:35:25.306 --> 00:35:27.709
We do trust modern medicine,

621
00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:29.978
but we just tried everything.
It's good news, right?

622
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:31.379
I'm sorry.

623
00:35:31.579 --> 00:35:34.916
We gave you the medicine that would
induce normal ovulation,

624
00:35:35.383 --> 00:35:36.518
but it didn't work.

625
00:35:36.518 --> 00:35:37.519
What?

626
00:35:37.519 --> 00:35:39.354
What should I do then?

627
00:35:39.354 --> 00:35:42.790
I told you that my husband thinks
that I'm pregnant.

628
00:35:43.124 --> 00:35:46.294
Thinking about this makes me
want to run away in my sleep.

629
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:49.898
It's driving me crazy, Doctor.

630
00:35:49.898 --> 00:35:52.934
In fact, the most important part of
this treatment is not the medicine,

631
00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:55.436
but calming your mind
and not getting stressed out.

632
00:35:55.436 --> 00:35:56.604
Hey,

633
00:35:56.938 --> 00:36:00.375
who gets stressed out
because they want to?

634
00:36:00.441 --> 00:36:03.244
Do you enjoy being stressed?

635
00:36:03.244 --> 00:36:06.581
I paid you so much
to receive treatment.

636
00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:09.884
You need to make something happen.

637
00:36:09.884 --> 00:36:13.555
How can you just tell us that
you can't do anything about this?

638
00:36:13.555 --> 00:36:16.124
- Ma'am, that's not what I meant.
- What is it then?

639
00:36:16.124 --> 00:36:18.626
Mom. I'm so sorry, Doctor.

640
00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:21.963
My mom tends to use
strong words when she gets upset.

641
00:36:21.963 --> 00:36:24.832
Next time, you should come here
with your husband.

642
00:36:24.832 --> 00:36:26.534
- What?
- Why?

643
00:36:26.734 --> 00:36:28.703
Why would a man need to come here?

644
00:36:28.703 --> 00:36:31.806
We need a long-term plan for
polycystic ovarian syndrome.

645
00:36:31.806 --> 00:36:33.575
If you two want a child,

646
00:36:33.575 --> 00:36:35.977
your husband needs to
cooperate actively.

647
00:36:36.244 --> 00:36:39.314
If you hide this, you will neither
treat it nor have children.

648
00:36:39.514 --> 00:36:42.417
So you need to come here
with your husband next time.

649
00:36:42.417 --> 00:36:44.419
That's what I said too.

650
00:36:44.419 --> 00:36:47.422
If you had told us this beforehand,

651
00:36:47.422 --> 00:36:49.424
I wouldn't have been angry.

652
00:36:49.424 --> 00:36:51.559
You've got the right answer.

653
00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:53.628
Well done.

654
00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:56.164
Yeon Ju, tell him.
Tell him the truth. Call him.

655
00:36:57.398 --> 00:36:59.667
- Mom.
- Tell him the truth.

656
00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:09.077
I knew it.

657
00:37:09.143 --> 00:37:10.445
When will you grow up?

658
00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:14.249
You'll be a mom soon.
You shouldn't drink coffee.

659
00:37:15.383 --> 00:37:17.785
- Actually...
- That reminds me.

660
00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:19.954
You've lost weight.

661
00:37:20.455 --> 00:37:21.856
Do you already have
morning sickness?

662
00:37:22.223 --> 00:37:24.459
No. Not at all.

663
00:37:25.393 --> 00:37:29.864
I have something to confess.

664
00:37:29.864 --> 00:37:32.834
Wait. There's something I have to
give you before that.

665
00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:34.602
Give me your hand.

666
00:37:44.045 --> 00:37:45.146
What's this?

667
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:52.854
- Honey.
- I've been very busy...

668
00:37:52.854 --> 00:37:54.922
that I couldn't focus on you
even though you're pregnant.

669
00:37:55.556 --> 00:37:56.824
Someone told me...

670
00:37:57.058 --> 00:38:00.361
we'll have a healthy baby
if we have baby shoes ready.

671
00:38:00.628 --> 00:38:03.398
Our baby, Kyuh La,
will find us all healthy...

672
00:38:03.398 --> 00:38:05.667
with those shoes.

673
00:38:06.734 --> 00:38:09.103
Honey. I'm sorry.

674
00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:19.647
What's wrong?

675
00:38:20.248 --> 00:38:21.683
Are you touched?

676
00:38:26.654 --> 00:38:28.923
Don't cry.
There's nothing to cry for.

677
00:38:28.923 --> 00:38:30.792
I'll treat you even better
from now on.

678
00:38:30.992 --> 00:38:32.827
Come on.

679
00:38:33.094 --> 00:38:35.129
I can't watch you anymore.

680
00:38:35.129 --> 00:38:37.999
How can you not notice it?

681
00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:39.667
Did you really go to Seoul
National University?

682
00:38:39.667 --> 00:38:43.037
How can you be so stupid?
Don't you get what's happening?

683
00:38:43.037 --> 00:38:46.474
You should've noticed it already...

684
00:38:46.474 --> 00:38:48.543
if she's crying so much
in middle of the day.

685
00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:51.913
Why can't you notice...

686
00:38:51.913 --> 00:38:54.349
that there must be something wrong?

687
00:38:55.016 --> 00:38:56.184
Mother.

688
00:38:56.184 --> 00:39:00.288
Do you know how difficult...

689
00:39:00.455 --> 00:39:04.225
and rough it is to be pregnant?

690
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.396
Right. Honey. I'm not pregnant.

691
00:39:09.864 --> 00:39:13.134
I can't get pregnant due to
polycystic ovarian syndrome.

692
00:39:13.668 --> 00:39:14.936
I'm sorry.

693
00:39:18.106 --> 00:39:20.375
She was in so much pain...

694
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:23.945
after she found out.

695
00:39:24.145 --> 00:39:26.848
It hurt me even more to watch her.

696
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:30.284
I almost vomited blood.

697
00:39:31.853 --> 00:39:33.154
Why didn't you tell me?

698
00:39:34.255 --> 00:39:35.690
I thought you'd be disappointed.

699
00:39:36.524 --> 00:39:38.359
I thought you'd hate me.

700
00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:44.065
I've never seen you so happy.

701
00:39:44.265 --> 00:39:46.100
You never treated me...

702
00:39:46.334 --> 00:39:49.303
so warmly and nicely.

703
00:39:50.838 --> 00:39:53.207
I felt like we're really
a married couple.

704
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:57.378
I'm sorry.

705
00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:02.483
I guess I'm a useless idiot.

706
00:40:02.683 --> 00:40:04.085
I'm sorry, honey.

707
00:40:14.495 --> 00:40:17.165
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

708
00:40:17.899 --> 00:40:19.667
I made you suffer.

709
00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:24.038
Don't cry. Don't cry.

710
00:40:25.273 --> 00:40:26.607
I'll change.

711
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:30.978
Oh, my.

712
00:40:31.345 --> 00:40:35.683
What made you change?
Wonders will never cease.

713
00:40:35.783 --> 00:40:39.086
A misfortune turned into a blessing.

714
00:40:39.086 --> 00:40:41.122
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

715
00:40:41.122 --> 00:40:44.992
Oh, my. I'm so happy.

716
00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:00.708
Fine.

717
00:41:01.075 --> 00:41:03.978
I should be responsible
for what I did.

718
00:41:05.112 --> 00:41:07.748
I won't be swayed by the past.

719
00:41:26.033 --> 00:41:30.938
Nurse Jo. Hand over Oh Han Gyul
to the police tomorrow.

720
00:41:42.183 --> 00:41:44.585
(Do you want to delete the image?)

721
00:41:55.763 --> 00:41:57.365
(Our love will last forever.)

722
00:42:00.167 --> 00:42:02.103
Ru Ri didn't want to go
on a blind date,

723
00:42:02.703 --> 00:42:05.273
so I went there for her instead.

724
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.542
She always disappoints me.

725
00:42:08.442 --> 00:42:09.744
She always cries.

726
00:42:10.811 --> 00:42:13.514
Now she even stabs me in the back.

727
00:42:14.749 --> 00:42:18.586
I'll teach her a lesson today.

728
00:42:30.264 --> 00:42:31.432
So Won.

729
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.702
Come home tonight.

730
00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:38.372
You'll find out when you come.

731
00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:41.075
Okay.

732
00:42:58.626 --> 00:43:01.262
You'll be in danger as long as
you stay in that company.

733
00:43:01.395 --> 00:43:04.231
I can't explain everything,
but she's dangerous.

734
00:43:04.231 --> 00:43:07.835
She'll do everything to achieve
her goal.

735
00:43:24.952 --> 00:43:26.687
- What are you doing?
- Gosh!

736
00:43:27.455 --> 00:43:29.557
Manager Jung.

737
00:43:29.724 --> 00:43:31.225
My gosh.

738
00:43:36.497 --> 00:43:38.766
How many places did you go to?

739
00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:41.902
I only went to three places
because I ran out of time.

740
00:43:41.902 --> 00:43:44.338
I'm going to visit all stores
in Seoul by this week.

741
00:43:44.338 --> 00:43:45.573
All of them?

742
00:43:45.573 --> 00:43:49.210
I was so jealous of my friends
who work.

743
00:43:50.044 --> 00:43:53.080
I finally got me a job that
I've been searching for three years.

744
00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.016
I really want to do my best.

745
00:43:56.017 --> 00:43:58.519
It's not even your first day yet.
Don't exhaust yourself.

746
00:43:58.653 --> 00:44:01.155
We'll have to do this as a team
anyway.

747
00:44:01.155 --> 00:44:03.124
Seriously, Manager Jung.

748
00:44:12.933 --> 00:44:14.035
- Oh, my!
- Stone!

749
00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:18.706
Come home early!
Why would you be home late?

750
00:44:18.806 --> 00:44:20.441
I have an important plan.

751
00:44:21.475 --> 00:44:23.744
Mom. How's Dad?

752
00:44:23.878 --> 00:44:24.979
Gosh.

753
00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:32.186
Luckily, your dad
hasn't noticed it yet.

754
00:44:32.553 --> 00:44:35.856
Still, if he finds out,
we'll both be dead.

755
00:44:36.057 --> 00:44:37.558
You have to be careful!

756
00:44:39.794 --> 00:44:42.563
I'm going to kill the two of you!

757
00:44:44.465 --> 00:44:45.599
Come home early!

758
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:58.012
You went to three stores,
but you haven't eaten yet?

759
00:44:58.012 --> 00:44:59.747
Did you forget I eat a lot?

760
00:45:00.081 --> 00:45:03.017
I tried the popular menu
at every store.

761
00:45:03.584 --> 00:45:04.785
And what did you think?

762
00:45:05.086 --> 00:45:07.955
Chef is the best job.

763
00:45:08.289 --> 00:45:10.191
- It is?
- Look.

764
00:45:12.059 --> 00:45:13.694
Do you like it?

765
00:45:15.496 --> 00:45:16.664
Over there too.

766
00:45:19.834 --> 00:45:22.036
They all look happy,
don't you think?

767
00:45:22.436 --> 00:45:23.938
So I noticed...

768
00:45:24.538 --> 00:45:27.942
everyone comes to our restaurant...

769
00:45:27.942 --> 00:45:30.344
to celebrate or to share joy.

770
00:45:31.746 --> 00:45:34.482
I'm so glad to work here.

771
00:45:34.515 --> 00:45:39.086
If our food tastes bad,
we'll ruin their joy.

772
00:45:39.453 --> 00:45:40.688
Don't worry.

773
00:45:42.323 --> 00:45:44.058
As much as I lack,

774
00:45:44.358 --> 00:45:47.394
I'm going to try harder
to fill in the gap.

775
00:45:48.095 --> 00:45:49.163
What's all this?

776
00:45:49.964 --> 00:45:53.033
I'm sorry. I must've gotten excited,

777
00:45:53.934 --> 00:45:55.936
but I'm really excited.

778
00:45:56.303 --> 00:46:00.941
I can't believe I found something
I can do in this society.

779
00:46:02.209 --> 00:46:03.644
I feel relaxed...

780
00:46:03.978 --> 00:46:06.614
and less stressed by meeting you.

781
00:46:06.847 --> 00:46:09.750
Why? Did something happen to you?

782
00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:13.053
Some tough incidents might happen.

783
00:46:13.954 --> 00:46:17.057
Are you sure you can do well
and follow me?

784
00:46:17.825 --> 00:46:18.993
Manager Jung.

785
00:46:19.393 --> 00:46:20.628
I trust you.

786
00:46:22.763 --> 00:46:25.232
Sure. I'll try my best.

787
00:46:25.933 --> 00:46:29.537
I'm looking forward to the time
we'll spend together.

788
00:46:29.837 --> 00:46:30.938
Me too.

789
00:46:33.474 --> 00:46:35.109
Can I order some dessert?

790
00:46:35.376 --> 00:46:36.477
No.

791
00:46:42.983 --> 00:46:44.185
They're...

792
00:46:49.456 --> 00:46:53.227
Jung Tae Yang. The more I see him,
the more I like him.

793
00:46:54.128 --> 00:46:55.229
Chairman Kevin.

794
00:46:56.897 --> 00:46:59.667
He looks familiar for some reason.

795
00:47:01.535 --> 00:47:05.039
He's a lot like me
when I was 20 years old.

796
00:47:06.874 --> 00:47:10.144
His eyes look similar to yours.

797
00:47:10.144 --> 00:47:11.245
Really?

798
00:47:14.915 --> 00:47:16.016
Eat up.

799
00:47:24.692 --> 00:47:26.393
Gosh, you surprised me.

800
00:47:26.627 --> 00:47:27.962
Why are you so surprised?

801
00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:31.131
- Did you do something wrong?
- Of course not.

802
00:47:31.365 --> 00:47:32.766
I was surprised because you were...

803
00:47:32.766 --> 00:47:35.536
standing there without
saying anything.

804
00:47:37.905 --> 00:47:41.108
Real estate agents
will come home to look around.

805
00:47:43.143 --> 00:47:44.578
Did you put it on sale?

806
00:47:44.578 --> 00:47:47.248
I told you before.
For Ru Ri to get married in October,

807
00:47:47.248 --> 00:47:50.184
we need to sell this house
and move to Namyangju.

808
00:47:50.484 --> 00:47:51.518
I...

809
00:47:52.086 --> 00:47:55.022
Honey, I don't think...

810
00:47:55.723 --> 00:47:59.627
Ru Ri and that man will get married.

811
00:47:59.627 --> 00:48:02.229
What? What are you talking about?

812
00:48:02.363 --> 00:48:05.266
Dong Ki wants them to get married
as soon as possible.

813
00:48:05.266 --> 00:48:07.268
No, that's not true.

814
00:48:07.401 --> 00:48:10.437
Ru Ri isn't going to marry him.

815
00:48:14.208 --> 00:48:15.242
What?

816
00:48:15.743 --> 00:48:17.311
Do I have something on my face?

817
00:48:18.479 --> 00:48:19.914
No, it's just a little strange.

818
00:48:21.582 --> 00:48:22.917
They tell me...

819
00:48:24.084 --> 00:48:25.853
that they're seeing each other
happily.

820
00:48:26.587 --> 00:48:28.455
Why are you saying things like that?

821
00:48:29.456 --> 00:48:32.226
Are you hiding something from me?

822
00:48:32.793 --> 00:48:37.665
No, of course not.
What would I be hiding from you?

823
00:48:39.533 --> 00:48:42.436
They must be home.

824
00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:59.687
Relax. Relax.

825
00:49:15.903 --> 00:49:17.204
Why did you bring a cake?

826
00:49:17.404 --> 00:49:18.772
He bought it for me.

827
00:49:18.872 --> 00:49:20.174
I met her in front of the house.

828
00:49:20.174 --> 00:49:21.976
She told me there was something
we need to celebrate.

829
00:49:21.976 --> 00:49:23.811
I don't know what it is,
but we'll celebrate it together.

830
00:49:23.811 --> 00:49:25.346
All right. Well done.

831
00:49:25.412 --> 00:49:29.016
It's been a while since we had
all the original members at home.

832
00:49:29.083 --> 00:49:30.417
Let's go eat.

833
00:49:30.918 --> 00:49:33.153
Hey, Ru Ri.

834
00:49:34.054 --> 00:49:35.622
Why are you so late?

835
00:49:35.723 --> 00:49:36.924
Dad.

836
00:49:38.492 --> 00:49:40.194
I... That is...

837
00:49:40.194 --> 00:49:43.864
Dong Ki said
you went on a date with Oh Mok Sin.

838
00:49:43.864 --> 00:49:45.899
Did you have dinner with him?

839
00:49:46.166 --> 00:49:47.835
What? Dinner?

840
00:49:49.303 --> 00:49:51.271
Tell him that you did.

841
00:49:51.271 --> 00:49:54.808
Yes, we did.

842
00:49:54.875 --> 00:49:57.644
We had dinner, tea, and...

843
00:49:57.644 --> 00:49:58.645
Is that true?

844
00:49:59.113 --> 00:50:00.381
- How dare you?
- Oh, my.

845
00:50:00.381 --> 00:50:01.515
- Father.
- Honey.

846
00:50:02.483 --> 00:50:03.517
Move.

847
00:50:03.917 --> 00:50:05.185
Calm down.

848
00:50:05.185 --> 00:50:08.188
I don't know what you heard...

849
00:50:08.188 --> 00:50:09.523
I told you to move.

850
00:50:09.523 --> 00:50:10.824
Honey.

851
00:50:10.824 --> 00:50:11.859
Move!

852
00:50:13.794 --> 00:50:14.862
Dad.

853
00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:17.498
Dad, I'm sorry.

854
00:50:17.498 --> 00:50:19.333
Shut your filthy mouth.

855
00:50:19.333 --> 00:50:22.803
- Dad.
- Do you think life is easy?

856
00:50:23.103 --> 00:50:25.105
Or do you think I'm someone
you can look down upon?

857
00:50:25.172 --> 00:50:28.175
No. Dad, it's not like that.

858
00:50:28.175 --> 00:50:29.643
I told you to shut your mouth.

859
00:50:30.744 --> 00:50:34.081
You are so stupid, and yet
I don't know where you learned...

860
00:50:34.081 --> 00:50:37.284
that bad habit of lying so easily
whenever you speak.

861
00:50:37.284 --> 00:50:39.353
Is that how I taught you to be?

862
00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.322
I'm sorry, Dad. But...

863
00:50:42.322 --> 00:50:43.457
Kneel down.

864
00:50:46.593 --> 00:50:48.762
Wait, honey.

865
00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:54.001
I know why you are angry,
and I think it's only normal.

866
00:50:54.001 --> 00:50:55.302
You should kneel down too.

867
00:50:55.536 --> 00:50:57.304
- Father.
- Don't interrupt.

868
00:50:57.538 --> 00:50:58.605
Kneel down!

869
00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:02.843
Kneel down.

870
00:51:02.843 --> 00:51:04.745
Kneel down. Kneel down.

871
00:51:08.315 --> 00:51:10.417
If you have any conscience left,

872
00:51:10.417 --> 00:51:12.453
put your hand on your heart
and ask yourselves...

873
00:51:12.453 --> 00:51:14.855
what you have done.

874
00:51:14.922 --> 00:51:17.724
Are you trying to kill me
after I had a stroke?

875
00:51:17.724 --> 00:51:19.293
You lied to me,

876
00:51:19.726 --> 00:51:23.997
and you stab me in the back
by buying a studio apartment.

877
00:51:26.033 --> 00:51:27.267
That's not all.

878
00:51:27.768 --> 00:51:31.805
I, Lee... Lee... Lee Shin Mo,

879
00:51:32.106 --> 00:51:35.742
have gained my trust
with great friends...

880
00:51:35.742 --> 00:51:38.879
with great hardship
for the last 60 years.

881
00:51:38.879 --> 00:51:42.249
You not only broke that trust
at a slit second,

882
00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:43.917
but also made me a laughing stock.

883
00:51:44.585 --> 00:51:46.920
What would people say about me?

884
00:51:47.087 --> 00:51:51.625
They would think of me
as a complete fool...

885
00:51:51.625 --> 00:51:55.162
who cannot manage
his wife and his daughter.

886
00:51:55.162 --> 00:51:58.365
- Shin Mo.
- You are worse.

887
00:51:59.266 --> 00:52:02.803
If this stupid daughter of ours
goes the wrong way,

888
00:52:02.936 --> 00:52:04.805
you should have tried to help her
to go the right way.

889
00:52:04.905 --> 00:52:08.308
You dare play along
with her insane plans?

890
00:52:08.609 --> 00:52:10.544
You don't deserve to be a mother.

891
00:52:10.978 --> 00:52:12.846
I warned you.

892
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.183
I told you not to interfere
with what I do with my children.

893
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:19.286
Why did you break your promise,

894
00:52:19.286 --> 00:52:21.455
and why did you act up?

895
00:52:23.524 --> 00:52:25.626
Lee Ru Ri, stand up.

896
00:52:29.496 --> 00:52:31.665
- Stand up.
- Mom.

897
00:52:31.932 --> 00:52:34.401
Hong Young Hye.

898
00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:36.436
What are you doing?

899
00:52:36.436 --> 00:52:39.673
You said I didn't keep my promise,
right?

900
00:52:39.873 --> 00:52:42.209
Then did you keep yours?

901
00:52:42.342 --> 00:52:44.244
You told me clearly...

902
00:52:44.478 --> 00:52:46.613
that you won't look down upon me...

903
00:52:46.613 --> 00:52:49.183
and treat me as an equal
as your partner.

904
00:52:49.183 --> 00:52:53.287
But is making me kneel down
in front of my children...

905
00:52:53.287 --> 00:52:55.556
what you call
treating me as an equal?

906
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:57.858
Hey, you!

907
00:52:57.858 --> 00:53:00.060
I know it was wrong to lie to you.

908
00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.728
But I don't think...

909
00:53:01.728 --> 00:53:04.464
it's something I need to kneel down
to apologize to you.

910
00:53:04.464 --> 00:53:06.033
Neither does Ru Ri.

911
00:53:06.033 --> 00:53:07.768
What?

912
00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:09.836
And you need to know...

913
00:53:09.937 --> 00:53:11.939
that you are not our master.

914
00:53:12.306 --> 00:53:15.375
I gave birth to her,
but now she's fully grown.

915
00:53:15.642 --> 00:53:18.245
No one can tell her what to do.

916
00:53:18.245 --> 00:53:20.113
Even if you are...

917
00:53:20.113 --> 00:53:23.183
the best and smartest father
you insist you are.

918
00:53:24.084 --> 00:53:25.686
She's right, Dad.

919
00:53:25.686 --> 00:53:28.822
I don't want to get married to
Oh Mok Sin.

920
00:53:28.822 --> 00:53:30.958
Even if it were a different person,

921
00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:33.393
I don't want to get married now.

922
00:53:33.627 --> 00:53:35.662
All I've done in my life...

923
00:53:35.762 --> 00:53:37.731
is going to school.

924
00:53:37.731 --> 00:53:40.534
I don't want to get married
against my will.

925
00:53:41.935 --> 00:53:42.936
Really?

926
00:53:42.936 --> 00:53:44.004
Yes.

927
00:53:44.605 --> 00:53:46.807
From now on,

928
00:53:46.807 --> 00:53:49.610
I want to decide what to do
in my life.

929
00:53:49.743 --> 00:53:51.612
You want to decide what to do?

930
00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:54.014
What do you want to do?

931
00:53:54.982 --> 00:53:57.884
Do you want to lie to your father,
go to a different country,

932
00:53:57.884 --> 00:53:59.853
and work like a servant
for the tourists?

933
00:54:00.087 --> 00:54:03.190
Do you want to live together
with a strange brat like him?

934
00:54:03.457 --> 00:54:05.125
Are you acting up to me...

935
00:54:05.125 --> 00:54:07.728
because I stopped you
from ruining your life?

936
00:54:07.728 --> 00:54:10.664
Dad. That's not it.

937
00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:13.734
Gosh, my head.

938
00:54:13.734 --> 00:54:15.035
Are you all right?

939
00:54:15.936 --> 00:54:19.773
Send these two out.

940
00:54:19.773 --> 00:54:23.543
My wife and daughter are both
trying to kill me.

941
00:54:23.543 --> 00:54:25.412
If I listen to them more,

942
00:54:25.412 --> 00:54:27.247
my blood vessels will all burst.

943
00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:29.516
Gosh, it hurts.

944
00:54:29.883 --> 00:54:32.786
My vessels. Oh, my.

945
00:54:32.786 --> 00:54:36.723
Honey, so please calm down
and listen to me.

946
00:54:36.723 --> 00:54:38.725
Let me go. Leave.

947
00:54:38.892 --> 00:54:41.128
- Honey.
- Why aren't you leaving?

948
00:54:41.995 --> 00:54:44.831
Get out. This is an order.

949
00:54:45.332 --> 00:54:46.667
All right.

950
00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.103
When you calm down,
we should have a talk.

951
00:54:50.103 --> 00:54:52.105
I have a lot of things
I want to tell you.

952
00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:53.774
- Let's go.
- Gosh.

953
00:54:54.107 --> 00:54:55.742
- Mom.
- Gosh.

954
00:54:56.243 --> 00:54:58.245
Look how arrogant they are.

955
00:54:58.245 --> 00:54:59.346
Hey.

956
00:55:00.747 --> 00:55:02.983
Don't go anywhere
and stay in the lobby.

957
00:55:02.983 --> 00:55:06.553
You should think about
what you did wrong...

958
00:55:06.553 --> 00:55:09.690
and repent all night long.

959
00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:11.325
You are so disgraceful!

960
00:55:11.325 --> 00:55:12.726
Gosh.

961
00:55:18.098 --> 00:55:19.900
Oh, my.

962
00:55:23.437 --> 00:55:25.572
Oh, my.

963
00:55:26.673 --> 00:55:27.874
Gosh.

964
00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:34.715
(Lee Kyuh La)

965
00:55:35.148 --> 00:55:38.785
He made a nickname for your baby.

966
00:55:39.086 --> 00:55:41.154
Life is like a war.

967
00:55:41.288 --> 00:55:43.957
I want your baby to win
in everything.

968
00:55:46.626 --> 00:55:48.061
What am I to do?

969
00:56:00.173 --> 00:56:03.310
Mom. Mom! Mom!

970
00:56:04.544 --> 00:56:06.246
What is it?

971
00:56:06.246 --> 00:56:09.416
Mom, why do you think
Father called So Won?

972
00:56:10.283 --> 00:56:14.187
Do you think he found out
that I'm not carrying a baby,

973
00:56:14.187 --> 00:56:15.722
and he's scolding him?

974
00:56:15.856 --> 00:56:19.126
What should I do? What if
he wants us to get a divorce?

975
00:56:19.192 --> 00:56:21.328
Shut your mouth.

976
00:56:21.495 --> 00:56:23.897
Why are you so negative?

977
00:56:24.064 --> 00:56:26.500
Why are you so cowardly?

978
00:56:26.533 --> 00:56:30.203
Your father-in-law can't do anything
bad to me.

979
00:56:30.203 --> 00:56:31.204
Why not?

980
00:56:31.204 --> 00:56:33.940
He has the same view of life.

981
00:56:34.708 --> 00:56:35.942
What is that?

982
00:56:35.942 --> 00:56:37.744
Money is power.

983
00:56:37.744 --> 00:56:39.513
Buildings last forever.

984
00:56:39.613 --> 00:56:42.916
We are a family. Don't worry.

985
00:56:44.184 --> 00:56:45.285
I'm going back to sleep.

986
00:56:46.453 --> 00:56:48.188
Gosh, why is she so worried?

987
00:56:53.059 --> 00:56:54.828
Have this medicine,
and get some rest.

988
00:57:04.805 --> 00:57:07.541
Tell me the truth.

989
00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:11.144
Do you regret marrying Yeon Ju?

990
00:57:12.212 --> 00:57:15.015
Was I wrong to set you up?

991
00:57:15.882 --> 00:57:18.018
No, Father. You did the right thing.

992
00:57:18.585 --> 00:57:21.288
Honestly, it was hard at first
because there was no love,

993
00:57:22.055 --> 00:57:24.724
but I'm glad I didn't marry Su Mi.

994
00:57:26.993 --> 00:57:30.096
Don't even talk about her.

995
00:57:31.331 --> 00:57:34.134
You'll never see her again
in your life.

996
00:57:34.534 --> 00:57:36.770
Yes. I agree with you.

997
00:57:38.805 --> 00:57:40.574
Look.

998
00:57:40.574 --> 00:57:44.377
Even though you're so smart,
you still obey me,

999
00:57:44.744 --> 00:57:48.248
but why would those stupid
mother and daughter...

1000
00:57:48.648 --> 00:57:50.484
go against me?

1001
00:57:51.017 --> 00:57:52.786
It's all for their good.

1002
00:57:52.786 --> 00:57:56.056
I'll talk to them on the way out.
Take a rest now.

1003
00:57:56.556 --> 00:58:00.727
Get her warm gukbap.

1004
00:58:01.628 --> 00:58:04.130
Your mom even skipped dinner.

1005
00:58:04.998 --> 00:58:06.533
Is that how much you love Mom?

1006
00:58:06.533 --> 00:58:09.269
Be quiet. Don't embarrass me.

1007
00:58:12.672 --> 00:58:16.076
She must be regretting now...

1008
00:58:16.376 --> 00:58:18.545
and crying so much.

1009
00:58:18.979 --> 00:58:22.682
- Dead drunk
- Dead drunk

1010
00:58:22.682 --> 00:58:26.553
- I'm exhausted
- I'm exhausted

1011
00:58:26.686 --> 00:58:29.923
- Before my heart stops
- Before my heart stops

1012
00:58:29.923 --> 00:58:32.626
- Come back please
- Come back please

1013
00:58:32.626 --> 00:58:33.627
It's fun!

1014
00:58:33.627 --> 00:58:36.763
- Before my heart stops
- Before my heart stops

1015
00:58:36.763 --> 00:58:38.665
- Come back please
- Come back please

1016
00:58:38.665 --> 00:58:40.734
- Yes!
- Yes!

1017
00:58:40.734 --> 00:58:42.502
Applause!

1018
00:58:43.703 --> 00:58:45.405
Oh, it was hard.

1019
00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:49.376
How is it, Mom?
Does it relieve your stress?

1020
00:58:51.211 --> 00:58:53.647
Yes. I should've done this earlier.

1021
00:58:54.981 --> 00:58:56.349
- Hey, Lee Ru Ri.
- Yes?

1022
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:59.252
Whatever Dad says,

1023
00:58:59.352 --> 00:59:02.722
don't ever quit
SC Food and Beverage.

1024
00:59:02.722 --> 00:59:04.057
- Get it?
- Really?

1025
00:59:04.057 --> 00:59:05.992
Then what about Manager Jung?

1026
00:59:06.192 --> 00:59:09.663
His conditions are bad,
but he sounds like a good guy.

1027
00:59:09.896 --> 00:59:10.964
Really?

1028
00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:14.267
- Mom.
- My goodness.

1029
00:59:14.334 --> 00:59:17.804
Hey, remember this.

1030
00:59:17.804 --> 00:59:19.873
Don't love men so easily.

1031
00:59:20.073 --> 00:59:22.242
Your dad was so nice at first.

1032
00:59:22.342 --> 00:59:23.810
Take it slow.

1033
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:26.646
It's never too late to love him...

1034
00:59:26.646 --> 00:59:29.482
even after you spend a year
with him.

1035
00:59:29.683 --> 00:59:30.984
I get it, Mom.

1036
00:59:31.418 --> 00:59:32.552
I love you.

1037
00:59:34.788 --> 00:59:36.289
Hey, let's sing.

1038
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:38.625
Let's relieve the 30 years
of stress.

1039
00:59:38.625 --> 00:59:39.793
Okay.

1040
00:59:42.662 --> 00:59:46.266
- Dead drunk
- Dead drunk

1041
00:59:46.266 --> 00:59:50.103
- I'm drunk
- I'm drunk

1042
00:59:50.303 --> 00:59:53.673
- I'm captivated by...
- I'm captivated by...

1043
00:59:53.673 --> 00:59:56.710
- your scent
- your scent

1044
01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:45.285
Why was he in my dream?

1045
01:01:46.186 --> 01:01:47.520
Something doesn't feel right.

1046
01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:57.464
She's beautiful. Who's she?

1047
01:01:57.997 --> 01:02:00.934
She's a dangerous woman.

1048
01:02:05.205 --> 01:02:07.373
Is it Jung Tae Yang's first day
today?

1049
01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:12.045
I'm worried the menu development
winners will oppose.

1050
01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:13.913
It's the world of unlimited
competition.

1051
01:02:14.013 --> 01:02:15.782
They can quit
if they have a problem.

1052
01:02:15.849 --> 01:02:19.185
This is related to inheriting the
company.

1053
01:02:19.686 --> 01:02:22.188
You shouldn't be interested in
only one person.

1054
01:02:22.288 --> 01:02:23.523
I'm not sure why,

1055
01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:28.495
but I can't stop being interested
in him.

1056
01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:40.774
You're embarrassing me!
I'm not a baby.

1057
01:02:40.774 --> 01:02:42.308
You can't drive me
on my first day of work.

1058
01:02:42.308 --> 01:02:45.745
I had a bad dream.
I don't want you to drive today.

1059
01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.848
Always be careful, and work hard.

1060
01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:51.184
That's enough.
I'm not joining the army.

1061
01:02:51.484 --> 01:02:53.286
Go now, Ms. Jung.

1062
01:02:55.155 --> 01:02:56.289
Bye.

1063
01:03:09.602 --> 01:03:12.806
I will handle that matter.
