5
00:00:55.727 --> 00:00:57.659
Lee Shi Yoon, Lee Shi Yoon.

6
00:00:59.254 --> 00:01:01.020
I've heard that name before.

7
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.205
- Ah, Mister Kang.
- Yes?

8
00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:08.571
Do you happen to know anything about
Lee Shi Young and Lee Shi Kyung's dad?

9
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:10.099
What is this about?

10
00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:12.539
They're both saying different things,
so I'm confused.

11
00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.149
Oh, he was a doctor.

12
00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.309
It was something like
a civil war in Africa.

13
00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:21.810
He went there to help and went missing.

14
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.269
Doctor?

15
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.333
Did their father live
in this neighborhood?

16
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.917
Probably.

17
00:01:30.917 --> 00:01:33.804
They moved from Seoul
into their grandma's house.

18
00:01:33.804 --> 00:01:35.890
That's right, then. Lee Shi Yoon!

19
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.417
- I thought I knew that name.
- What?

20
00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:44.090
An old classmate of mine
went to medical school.

21
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.616
I think it's the same Lee Shi Yoon.

22
00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:49.405
Wow, Lee Shi Yoon.

23
00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:50.894
I haven't heard his name in so long.

24
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.985
Wait... then those are Shi Yoon's kids?

25
00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:08.143
<i>I have to think about things slowly,
one by one, in times like this.</i>

26
00:02:09.387 --> 00:02:10.840
<i>Let's get things in order.</i>

27
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.995
<i>The most urgent thing is answering Bom.</i>

28
00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:16.418
<i>What should I say to her?</i>

29
00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:18.397
<i>Also, Shi Young.</i>

30
00:02:18.397 --> 00:02:21.767
<i>I have no idea how
to deal with Lee Shi Young.</i>

31
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.781
<i>Especially that nasty temper of hers.</i>

32
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:27.825
<i>No, this isn't it.</i>

33
00:02:27.825 --> 00:02:29.735
<i>I need to talk to Shi Young too.</i>

34
00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:32.404
<i>No, it's impossible to talk to her.</i>

35
00:02:32.404 --> 00:02:34.945
<i>- Oh, I don't know. I don't know.</i>
<i>- Who took it?</i>

36
00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:17.612
<i>What is this sense of dread?</i>

37
00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:19.343
<i>And this fear?</i>

38
00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:27.587
Hey, hey, hey!

39
00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:29.235
Hey, what are you doing?

40
00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:30.916
Eat it all you want.

41
00:03:37.098 --> 00:03:38.845
Hey. Why are you taking that?

42
00:03:38.845 --> 00:03:41.464
This is what you owe me
for eating all the food I bought.

43
00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:46.040
Hey!

44
00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:52.676
Lee Shi Young, where are you going
at this hour?

45
00:03:53.808 --> 00:03:56.349
Aren't you going to apologize to Grandma?

46
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.384
Haven't you noticed she's been
coming home late since you did that?

47
00:04:02.661 --> 00:04:04.394
- Gosh, that girl.
- Lee Shi Young!

48
00:04:04.394 --> 00:04:06.775
That's the last of my emergency money.

49
00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:07.904
Give it back!

50
00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:10.612
She's not up to anything strange, is she?

51
00:04:11.286 --> 00:04:12.703
Oh yeah. Hey!

52
00:04:12.703 --> 00:04:16.195
The student dean said to bring
a written apology when you get to school.

53
00:04:16.195 --> 00:04:17.552
I delivered the message.

54
00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:18.894
Written apology? Why?

55
00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:20.367
Huh?

56
00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:23.261
Lee Shi Young's always writing those
wherever she goes.

57
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:24.300
It's nothing.

58
00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:27.290
What's wrong with your face?

59
00:04:30.364 --> 00:04:32.295
Mom... yogurt.

60
00:04:34.614 --> 00:04:37.696
Shi Young doesn't treat you like an
older brother because you act like this.

61
00:04:39.614 --> 00:04:41.258
It tastes good though.

62
00:04:41.258 --> 00:04:43.456
You better not think about going out.

63
00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:45.251
Don't you dare go to an internet cafe.

64
00:04:46.182 --> 00:04:47.453
So dirty.

65
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.400
Hello? Grandma?

66
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.258
Are you still at the hospice?

67
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.251
What?

68
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:09.235
Ah, that grandma
with the teardrop diamond?

69
00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:12.614
Yes, that's right.
That lady from last time.

70
00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:15.795
She wants to learn how to play Go-Stop.

71
00:05:15.795 --> 00:05:17.665
Can you come now?

72
00:05:18.802 --> 00:05:21.615
Okay. Come quickly.

73
00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:27.275
Oh Bong Sook must be
looking for Shi Kyung.

74
00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.384
I did a little manipulation.

75
00:05:30.384 --> 00:05:32.266
She enjoys playing Go-Stop.

76
00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:34.461
I want her to learn from Shi Kyung
and have some fun.

77
00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:38.403
It's better than her cursing
at her children all the time.

78
00:05:38.403 --> 00:05:41.603
Grandma Duk Boon,
you're Shi Kyung's grandmother.

79
00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:43.160
I didn't know.

80
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.083
I've lived as if I had no grandson,
granddaughter, or daughter-in-law.

81
00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:49.862
I don't know why I was
so against seeing them.

82
00:05:51.126 --> 00:05:53.619
You embrace everyone in the world.

83
00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.057
Why did you feel that way?

84
00:05:55.057 --> 00:05:57.687
What do you mean you embraced it?

85
00:05:59.018 --> 00:06:00.893
My son went missing.

86
00:06:02.223 --> 00:06:05.951
It was the people here
who helped me to go on living.

87
00:06:07.182 --> 00:06:08.453
If you had really known me...

88
00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:11.843
I was being a petty person.

89
00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:14.073
Why would you say that?

90
00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:18.033
Do you know how much I respect you,
Grandma Duk Boon?

91
00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:20.518
Oh no. Don't say such a thing.

92
00:06:20.518 --> 00:06:24.776
Why would someone like you say that
to an illiterate person like me?

93
00:06:24.776 --> 00:06:26.509
Oh, right.

94
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:30.506
Kim Jae Woong agreed to see his mother.

95
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:35.453
Of course, he should.
He should see her before he dies.

96
00:06:35.453 --> 00:06:39.713
His mother will never get over it
if he passes away without seeing her.

97
00:06:39.713 --> 00:06:43.052
But, it will be difficult
to get his mother over here.

98
00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:44.973
We have no one who can pick her up.

99
00:06:44.973 --> 00:06:48.001
She can't come here on her own.

100
00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:51.658
We should get her here any way we can.

101
00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:53.624
Where does she live?

102
00:06:53.624 --> 00:06:57.023
Somewhere by the sea
in Boryeong, Chungcheong-do.

103
00:06:57.023 --> 00:06:58.064
Really?

104
00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.775
What is her exact address?

105
00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.093
How do I do it?

106
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:11.081
You just swipe it with your finger.

107
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:12.109
Like this.

108
00:07:15.588 --> 00:07:16.735
That's not it.

109
00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:19.821
I was trying to swipe the other card.

110
00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:22.530
You'll get used to it if you keep at it.

111
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.716
- Try once more.
- Should I?

112
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.968
This time I'll do this one.

113
00:07:28.968 --> 00:07:31.490
It worked! It worked!

114
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.917
It worked?

115
00:07:34.396 --> 00:07:36.949
It worked. It worked! Oh, it worked!

116
00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:39.357
I told you it would work.

117
00:07:41.407 --> 00:07:45.182
At times like this,
we have to do a high-five.

118
00:07:45.182 --> 00:07:48.446
Oh, we need to do it right
if we're going to do it.

119
00:07:49.453 --> 00:07:51.115
- Oh yeah!
- Oh yeah!

120
00:07:55.187 --> 00:07:57.586
When you're not using it,
you need to...

121
00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:02.662
press this here to turn it off.

122
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:07.307
I'm giving this to you because
I'm thankful, so take it.

123
00:08:07.692 --> 00:08:08.934
No, it's okay.

124
00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:12.350
Put it away before someone comes.

125
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.511
I'm thankful to your grandma,
but she will never take my money.

126
00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:17.434
So, I want you to accept some.

127
00:08:17.434 --> 00:08:19.001
No, it's okay.

128
00:08:20.302 --> 00:08:21.972
Are things going well?

129
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.369
Good, good.

130
00:08:26.369 --> 00:08:29.210
- It's so fun.
- I'm sure it is.

131
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.210
One more round?

132
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.730
<i>If I think about it...</i>

133
00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:37.510
<i>I've never gone out to eat with Bom.</i>

134
00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:39.891
<i>We've never done anything together.</i>

135
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:44.022
Okay, I'll use this
to go somewhere nice with Bom.

136
00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:48.063
We'll eat something delicious,
and I'll answer her in a cool manner.

137
00:08:48.063 --> 00:08:49.490
No...

138
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.135
I'll give her a cool answer.

139
00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:53.286
Then, we'll eat something delicious.

140
00:08:55.775 --> 00:08:57.515
I don't know.

141
00:08:57.515 --> 00:08:59.625
I'll just use it wisely and be good
to that grandma.

142
00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:01.886
Just think of it as
a kind of part-time job.

143
00:09:01.886 --> 00:09:04.919
Yes, that's perfectly normal.

144
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.551
<i>Bring a cactus tomorrow,
and come to my office.</i>

145
00:09:20.642 --> 00:09:22.694
- You want to borrow my phone?
- Yes.

146
00:09:22.694 --> 00:09:23.963
Just for a day, okay?

147
00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:25.703
I really need it today.

148
00:09:25.703 --> 00:09:28.253
I have a really important group chat
with my cosplay friends.

149
00:09:28.253 --> 00:09:30.693
Huh? Please, Aunt Jung Soo.
Just for a day.

150
00:09:30.693 --> 00:09:32.444
Ah, I don't think so.

151
00:09:32.444 --> 00:09:35.703
You don't have anyone calling you,
and you have your computer.

152
00:09:35.703 --> 00:09:37.782
You're going to be home all day.

153
00:09:37.782 --> 00:09:41.233
No, I need my phone too.

154
00:09:41.233 --> 00:09:43.264
Sorry, but I can't lend you this.

155
00:09:43.264 --> 00:09:45.015
You're being so harsh, Aunt.

156
00:09:46.015 --> 00:09:49.015
Other aunts buy their nieces phones.

157
00:09:49.015 --> 00:09:50.704
You can't even lend me yours?

158
00:09:50.704 --> 00:09:53.324
How many years have you lived
off of our household?

159
00:09:53.324 --> 00:09:55.492
You should feel guilty,
and lend it to me.

160
00:09:56.842 --> 00:10:00.064
Hey, I'd rather buy you a phone.

161
00:10:00.064 --> 00:10:01.801
Later on.

162
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:05.904
Aunt, do you have a weird personal
reason why you won't lend it to me?

163
00:10:05.904 --> 00:10:07.021
Do you have a man?

164
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:10.554
Are you in some sort
of illicit relationship?

165
00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:14.397
Come on. It's nothing like that.
What are you saying?

166
00:10:14.397 --> 00:10:18.017
I just really need the phone today.

167
00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:19.641
Aunt, look at that. Look, look.

168
00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:21.029
What is it?

169
00:10:21.029 --> 00:10:24.717
Lee Shi Young, I'm waiting
for a phone call.

170
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.210
<i>Where should we go, and how can I
answer her and look really cool?</i>

171
00:10:33.237 --> 00:10:35.548
Hey, you! Student.

172
00:10:36.747 --> 00:10:38.931
Did you bring your written apology?

173
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.486
What is this?
I've seen this somewhere before.

174
00:10:44.848 --> 00:10:46.920
How rude of you to take my clothes?

175
00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:49.689
All right. I'll let you off the hook.

176
00:10:49.689 --> 00:10:50.699
It's not the first time.

177
00:10:50.699 --> 00:10:53.517
What about the 10,000 won
you took from me last time?

178
00:10:53.517 --> 00:10:55.429
Give me my 10,000 won.

179
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.943
Hey, there. Student, student!

180
00:10:58.943 --> 00:11:00.675
Can't you hear me?

181
00:11:00.675 --> 00:11:02.159
Oh, hello.

182
00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:04.920
Come on in. Come in.

183
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.285
- Hello.
- Get in front of me.

184
00:11:07.285 --> 00:11:08.713
It's Shi Kyung.

185
00:11:08.713 --> 00:11:10.544
- Good morning.
- Hello.

186
00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:12.152
- Hello.
- Good morning.

187
00:11:17.314 --> 00:11:18.652
Good morning.

188
00:11:18.652 --> 00:11:21.442
So, Bom said she had something
to talk to Shi Kyung about.

189
00:11:21.442 --> 00:11:22.793
What was that about?

190
00:11:22.793 --> 00:11:25.515
Hey, I asked you first.

191
00:11:25.515 --> 00:11:26.928
Aren't you friendly with Shi Young?

192
00:11:26.928 --> 00:11:28.862
Ask Shi Young, okay?

193
00:11:28.862 --> 00:11:30.060
I don't know either.

194
00:11:33.703 --> 00:11:37.382
Hasn't Bernard mentioned anything
back at home?

195
00:11:37.382 --> 00:11:39.067
He hasn't said anything.

196
00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:42.833
If you're so curious,
ask Bom or Bernard yourself.

197
00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.304
There she is. Ask her.

198
00:11:48.002 --> 00:11:49.615
No, it's okay.

199
00:11:54.291 --> 00:11:57.366
Where did you get that hoodie?

200
00:11:57.366 --> 00:11:59.065
This? It's Shi Kyung's.

201
00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:01.548
Do you want to switch with me for today?

202
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.660
Sounds good.

203
00:12:05.974 --> 00:12:08.636
<i>Today, I have to say something,
just anything.</i>

204
00:12:08.636 --> 00:12:12.075
<i>If I just stay around like this,
it's as if I did nothing.</i>

205
00:12:13.087 --> 00:12:15.765
<i>But, what am I supposed to say to her?</i>

206
00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:21.664
Bom.

207
00:12:25.982 --> 00:12:26.986
Bom.

208
00:12:28.761 --> 00:12:29.775
Bom.

209
00:12:29.775 --> 00:12:32.707
Bom... Bom.

210
00:12:32.707 --> 00:12:34.449
Gosh.

211
00:12:38.228 --> 00:12:40.843
Yes, should we date?

212
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:42.846
Is that too common?

213
00:12:43.748 --> 00:12:45.538
I thought about it.

214
00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:48.728
Let's just date.

215
00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:50.775
Is this kind of cool?

216
00:12:55.872 --> 00:12:57.222
I'm angry right now.

217
00:12:59.202 --> 00:13:02.622
I hate myself for not asking you
to date me first.

218
00:13:07.758 --> 00:13:09.080
Crazy punk.

219
00:13:24.202 --> 00:13:27.420
Hey, I thought about it.

220
00:13:28.918 --> 00:13:31.293
Give me a few more days.

221
00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:34.774
It's not because I dislike you
or anything.

222
00:13:37.736 --> 00:13:39.945
I like being with you too.

223
00:13:40.844 --> 00:13:44.237
Also, thank you for telling me first.

224
00:13:45.229 --> 00:13:50.681
But, I think I need more time
to think and not answer so quickly.

225
00:13:51.794 --> 00:13:53.692
I don't know why that is.

226
00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:57.609
Okay, I'll be honest.

227
00:13:58.641 --> 00:13:59.655
Perhaps...

228
00:14:00.568 --> 00:14:03.414
it's because I've never
had a girlfriend before.

229
00:14:04.573 --> 00:14:09.694
All the women around me are
my mom, my aunt, and Shi Young.

230
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:13.373
Honestly, I thought all girls
were like Shi Young.

231
00:14:13.373 --> 00:14:17.176
Stubborn, young, and selfish.

232
00:14:17.176 --> 00:14:18.358
She does whatever she wants.

233
00:14:21.367 --> 00:14:23.766
You're different though.

234
00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:25.838
So, I was taken aback.

235
00:14:27.016 --> 00:14:28.458
I won't drag this out.

236
00:14:29.247 --> 00:14:30.788
Give me a few days.

237
00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:33.656
You can wait for me, right?

238
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.529
Thank you!

239
00:14:41.928 --> 00:14:43.426
I'll contact you when I'm ready.

240
00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:45.208
Have high expectations.

241
00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:48.223
You know you look quite pretty
from the back too.

242
00:14:50.462 --> 00:14:52.083
Hey, you. Student!

243
00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:09.688
Why wait so many days?

244
00:15:09.688 --> 00:15:11.916
Let's just end this today.

245
00:15:13.117 --> 00:15:15.583
How... how are you here?

246
00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:18.120
You were talking to Bom
who looks pretty from the back.

247
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.448
What are you going to do now that
your stubborn little sister heard it?

248
00:15:21.448 --> 00:15:24.517
Don't worry though, Bernard,

249
00:15:24.517 --> 00:15:26.449
Where did you get that?

250
00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:28.452
You borrowed it from Aunt Jung Soo?

251
00:15:29.282 --> 00:15:31.430
<i>I like being with you too.</i>

252
00:15:32.386 --> 00:15:35.550
<i>Also, thank you for telling me first.</i>

253
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.769
Lee Shi Young!

254
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.289
I'll go to Bom and our classmates.

255
00:15:39.289 --> 00:15:43.497
I'll deliver this cheesy recording
to them without leaving any of it out.

256
00:15:43.497 --> 00:15:45.743
Hey, you can't do that!

257
00:15:45.743 --> 00:15:47.503
Are you really going to tell them?

258
00:15:47.503 --> 00:15:48.862
Hey, hey!

259
00:15:48.862 --> 00:15:51.251
You're not that thoughtless.

260
00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:52.516
But, I am.

261
00:15:52.516 --> 00:15:54.530
I'm stubborn, young, and selfish.

262
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.203
What can't I do?

263
00:15:56.203 --> 00:16:00.166
Hey, I didn't mean to say that.
Don't do it.

264
00:16:00.166 --> 00:16:04.939
<i>I'd rather forget about the cruel things
Shi Young did to me that day.</i>

265
00:16:04.939 --> 00:16:08.516
<i>Though, I did get my
petty revenge on her.</i>

266
00:16:14.234 --> 00:16:15.290
What?

267
00:16:16.245 --> 00:16:19.565
Ah, Shi Young?
You're still thinking about that?

268
00:16:19.565 --> 00:16:21.916
- You're lucky.
- Why?

269
00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:25.035
You don't have a little sister.

270
00:16:25.824 --> 00:16:28.133
I wish I had a little sister
like Shi Young.

271
00:16:28.685 --> 00:16:29.770
Want to adopt her?

272
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.601
- What?
- No.

273
00:16:31.601 --> 00:16:34.800
Lee Shi Young is not human.

274
00:16:36.617 --> 00:16:37.705
Let's divide her.

275
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.753
I'll let you have more.

276
00:16:41.469 --> 00:16:42.521
Sure.

277
00:16:42.521 --> 00:16:46.373
But, nothing much happened
with Shi Young in class.

278
00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:48.209
What do you mean nothing happened?

279
00:16:48.209 --> 00:16:52.800
Lee Shi Young is a
total mental alpha-witch.

280
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.070
<i>I thought I was going to go crazy.</i>

281
00:16:59.099 --> 00:17:01.760
It's actually in my cell phone.

282
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.578
Where is it?

283
00:17:03.578 --> 00:17:06.027
Isn't it so pretty?

284
00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.425
Please.

285
00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:12.397
Please.

286
00:17:14.226 --> 00:17:15.292
Put it down.

287
00:17:16.356 --> 00:17:18.117
Put it down. Put it down.

288
00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:28.757
Is she serious?

289
00:17:44.098 --> 00:17:46.367
<i>That's why Shi Young
went to the nurse's office.</i>

290
00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:49.927
Was Shi Young seriously injured?

291
00:17:49.927 --> 00:17:52.726
I told you Lee Shi Young
is an alpha-witch.

292
00:17:52.726 --> 00:17:54.636
She doesn't get hurt.

293
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.685
She even went overboard
on the fall since I was watching.

294
00:17:59.181 --> 00:18:02.552
Why does it matter if Bom hears it?

295
00:18:02.552 --> 00:18:04.825
Weren't you saying it for Bom to hear?

296
00:18:04.825 --> 00:18:06.522
Hey, is that the same?

297
00:18:06.522 --> 00:18:11.165
Telling her myself and
having my little sister tell for me.

298
00:18:11.165 --> 00:18:12.519
Is that the same?

299
00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:14.015
I suppose so.

300
00:18:14.015 --> 00:18:16.209
I'm a little knowledgeable in this area.

301
00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.500
Hey, I need to use your phone.

302
00:18:25.463 --> 00:18:27.434
<i>Stop. You're going to run into that.</i>

303
00:18:34.255 --> 00:18:35.849
<i>Look at you looking around.</i>

304
00:18:41.195 --> 00:18:42.850
I kept you from hitting your head.

305
00:18:45.493 --> 00:18:46.499
What are you doing here?

306
00:18:46.499 --> 00:18:48.041
I had a snack with Ga Ram.

307
00:18:48.041 --> 00:18:49.500
What about you?

308
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.867
I didn't get to see you at school.

309
00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:54.598
I went to see the nurse because
I wasn't feeling well.

310
00:18:54.598 --> 00:18:56.961
- What about now? Are you okay?
- Yes.

311
00:18:56.961 --> 00:19:00.205
Since we met up like this,
should we go see a movie?

312
00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:02.712
- I'll treat.
- That sounds good.

313
00:19:02.712 --> 00:19:04.412
There's a movie I want to see.

314
00:19:06.242 --> 00:19:09.072
You're in first place at school.
Don't you have to study?

315
00:19:09.072 --> 00:19:11.580
No, I don't have much to study today.

316
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.026
What about the talent show practice?
You're not doing that?

317
00:19:14.026 --> 00:19:17.113
Oh, I couldn't get the dance right.
I stopped for now.

318
00:19:17.113 --> 00:19:19.363
Didn't Joo Yeon contact you?

319
00:19:19.363 --> 00:19:22.823
<i>He said he was knowledgeable about this.
What a dense guy.</i>

320
00:19:24.884 --> 00:19:27.542
I'm going to get going now.
I suddenly have something to study.

321
00:19:29.072 --> 00:19:31.774
Why? You should watch with us.

322
00:19:31.774 --> 00:19:33.562
<i>I'm suddenly so thankful.</i>

323
00:19:34.395 --> 00:19:36.473
Have you had dinner yet?

324
00:19:36.473 --> 00:19:39.511
- Not yet.
- What do you like? What do you want?

325
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.721
Do you want to eat before the movie
or after the movie?

326
00:19:42.721 --> 00:19:45.139
We have to take a bus
to get to the theater.

327
00:19:45.139 --> 00:19:48.031
They have good cow intestines
and chicken feet.

328
00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:50.305
I like fried beef sausage too.

329
00:19:51.585 --> 00:19:53.781
Okay. I'll treat you to everything today.

330
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.118
Who could that be?

331
00:20:00.129 --> 00:20:01.201
<i>[Shi Young]</i>

332
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:06.121
This alpha-witch hates me so much.
Why is she always calling me?

333
00:20:08.062 --> 00:20:09.071
What?

334
00:20:09.071 --> 00:20:11.001
<i>Shi Kyung.</i>

335
00:20:12.194 --> 00:20:13.241
Shi Young.

336
00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:15.366
What's wrong?

337
00:20:15.366 --> 00:20:17.340
Part-time job? You?

338
00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:20.308
What's wrong?

339
00:20:20.308 --> 00:20:23.377
Where are you? Stay put.

340
00:20:23.377 --> 00:20:24.707
I'll be right there.

341
00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:28.809
I'm going to see Shi Young,
and I'll be right back.

342
00:20:42.956 --> 00:20:44.241
What happened?

343
00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:48.155
Who was it? Who did this to you?

344
00:20:49.657 --> 00:20:54.033
Ordered iced coffee, but...

345
00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:58.425
Then... refund...

346
00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.924
She wanted it back.

347
00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:04.884
Fired...

348
00:21:04.884 --> 00:21:07.684
Order was wrong...

349
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.175
Where is that woman!

350
00:21:15.018 --> 00:21:16.181
Hey, lady!

351
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:18.720
I heard that you threw iced coffee
in my little sister's face.

352
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.856
Do you want to experience the same thing?

353
00:21:20.856 --> 00:21:21.871
You can't.

354
00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:23.614
Let me go. Let go!

355
00:21:23.614 --> 00:21:25.845
This won't help you or Shi Young.

356
00:21:25.845 --> 00:21:29.629
This woman threw ice coffee at Shi Young,
and she even demanded money!

357
00:21:29.629 --> 00:21:31.871
Hey! Which school do you attend?

358
00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:33.257
Who's your homeroom teacher?

359
00:21:33.257 --> 00:21:37.558
How is it that even the kids here
are so shabby?

360
00:21:37.558 --> 00:21:39.975
Hey, call your parents right now.

361
00:21:39.975 --> 00:21:41.733
What will you do if I call my parents?

362
00:21:41.733 --> 00:21:45.594
What did my Shi Young do wrong
that she deserved that?

363
00:21:50.001 --> 00:21:51.763
Bom came with Shi Kyung, right?

364
00:21:51.763 --> 00:21:53.728
Why did she suddenly leave?

365
00:21:53.728 --> 00:21:56.138
I don't know. They were planning
to go see a movie.

366
00:21:56.138 --> 00:21:59.257
Bom seems to have so many secrets.

367
00:22:00.107 --> 00:22:03.108
Can a simple guy like
Shi Kyung handle her?

368
00:22:03.108 --> 00:22:04.739
Don't underestimate Shi Kyung.

369
00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:09.877
He may seem simple at times,
but he can surprise you, too.

370
00:22:09.877 --> 00:22:11.906
- You saw earlier.
- What?

371
00:22:11.906 --> 00:22:14.157
You mean how he got mad at that lady?

372
00:22:14.157 --> 00:22:15.986
That's true too.

373
00:22:15.986 --> 00:22:19.647
Neither Bom nor I understood
a thing you were saying.

374
00:22:19.647 --> 00:22:22.147
But Shi Kyung understood
everything right away.

375
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.694
That's because he's my older brother.

376
00:22:24.694 --> 00:22:26.742
So, he is your older brother.

377
00:22:26.742 --> 00:22:30.134
Hey, hey, hey. What older brother?

378
00:22:30.134 --> 00:22:31.901
Will the day ever come
when I'll understand

379
00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:33.430
what you're saying when you cry?

380
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.113
It was almost like alien language.

381
00:22:36.103 --> 00:22:37.177
Make an effort.

382
00:22:37.177 --> 00:22:39.664
You're smart, so you'll be faster
than Shi Kyung.

383
00:22:39.664 --> 00:22:42.354
Then, I better make you cry often.

384
00:22:42.354 --> 00:22:44.694
That way you'll speak
that alien language.

385
00:22:44.694 --> 00:22:47.165
What are you talking about?
I don't really cry much.

386
00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:50.147
Yeah right. You looked like
you had cried many times.

387
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.719
You know you're becoming more
and more like Lee Shi Kyung.

388
00:22:54.719 --> 00:22:56.520
I am, huh?

389
00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.340
Shi Kyung is in me.

390
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.841
That's a good thing.

391
00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:03.373
Look at that. Look at that.

392
00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:06.071
Kim Bom, wait!

393
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:07.094
Kim Bom.

394
00:23:07.094 --> 00:23:09.242
Just wait.

395
00:23:10.604 --> 00:23:13.105
Talk to me. Just talk to me.

396
00:23:13.105 --> 00:23:14.865
I don't want to talk to you.

397
00:23:14.865 --> 00:23:16.194
Why are you being this way?

398
00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:19.703
We were supposed to see a movie.
Is this because of Shi Young?

399
00:23:19.703 --> 00:23:20.828
Give this to me.

400
00:23:20.828 --> 00:23:22.597
You have to tell me
in order for me to know.

401
00:23:22.597 --> 00:23:25.081
I won't know if you don't tell me.

402
00:23:25.081 --> 00:23:29.550
I've never had a girlfriend before,
so I don't know the reason.

403
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.800
Please tell me.

404
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.151
Tell me, would you?

405
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:36.787
Okay. I'll tell you.

406
00:23:36.787 --> 00:23:40.058
I have to tell you in order for you
to be really disappointed in me.

407
00:23:40.058 --> 00:23:42.206
What do you mean?

408
00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:45.442
- I'm jealous.
- Jealous?

409
00:23:46.115 --> 00:23:47.250
Jealous of what?

410
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:48.802
I have no one.

411
00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:52.626
Even if I called someone crying,
no one would ever come running like that.

412
00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:55.990
Not ever... no one.

413
00:23:57.588 --> 00:23:59.397
You're not jealous of Shi Young, are you?

414
00:24:00.143 --> 00:24:01.585
You know me.

415
00:24:01.585 --> 00:24:03.419
Shi Young and I are enemies.

416
00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:07.453
I hate myself for being like this,
so just leave me alone.

417
00:24:08.654 --> 00:24:09.864
You have your dad.

418
00:24:11.013 --> 00:24:13.003
You seem very close to your dad.

419
00:24:14.105 --> 00:24:17.424
Go. Just go!

Deferred payment. What's that?

428
00:25:21.892 --> 00:25:24.382
Do your mission first.

429
00:25:24.382 --> 00:25:27.435
If you do a good job on that mission,
then you can bring me a cactus.

<i>I am not curious.</i>

433
00:25:35.526 --> 00:25:37.097
Listen even if you're not curious.

434
00:25:37.097 --> 00:25:39.030
<i>Huh? She can read my mind.</i>

435
00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:42.915
You know the patient
Kim Jae Woong at the hospice?

436
00:25:42.915 --> 00:25:45.745
I heard Grandma Duk Boo
made him soybean paste soup.

437
00:25:45.745 --> 00:25:49.748
- Yes.
- Go and bring his mother here.

438
00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:51.951
She lives by the sea in Chungcheong-do.

439
00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:52.989
Why would I do that?

440
00:25:52.989 --> 00:25:55.341
The patient wants to see her.

441
00:25:55.341 --> 00:25:57.620
No one can bring her though.

442
00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.310
But, why would I go?

443
00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.360
You will be compensated
for your transportation costs.

444
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.669
No.

445
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:07.184
I'm very bad with directions.

446
00:26:07.184 --> 00:26:11.531
Of course, it would be great
for the patient to see his mother.

447
00:26:11.531 --> 00:26:13.063
You can go with a friend.

448
00:26:16.723 --> 00:26:19.934
Yes, I'll go with Bom.
We can see the ocean too.

449

I heard that your mother is coming today.

00:27:18.917 --> 00:27:20.040
Yes.

455
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.078
I heard she couldn't come on her own.
I guess someone is bringing her.

456
00:27:24.078 --> 00:27:27.598
Yes, but I don't know who it is.

457
00:27:28.935 --> 00:27:30.661
I'm thankful to whoever it is.

458
00:27:30.661 --> 00:27:34.399
You must be excited.

459
00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:36.055
I couldn't sleep a wink.

460
00:27:37.346 --> 00:27:41.658
Honestly, I still can't believe
it's really happening.

<i>was very different from what
I had originally imagined.</i>

464
00:28:14.044 --> 00:28:16.058
Why didn't you answer the phone?

465
00:28:16.058 --> 00:28:17.226
Let's talk inside.

466
00:28:17.226 --> 00:28:19.576
I have to go somewhere now.

467
00:28:19.576 --> 00:28:21.126
Where would you go?

468
00:28:21.126 --> 00:28:23.787
I left early in the morning
just to see you.

469
00:28:23.787 --> 00:28:25.107
Get inside.

470
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.081
I got a call from school and heard that
you've missed several days of school.

471
00:28:52.081 --> 00:28:55.796
Why are you even here if you're
not even attending school?

472
00:28:57.061 --> 00:28:59.733
Is it because of that great dad of yours?

473
00:28:59.733 --> 00:29:02.592
If I wasn't here,
what would you be able to do for me?

474
00:29:02.592 --> 00:29:04.223
What would you do?

475
00:29:04.223 --> 00:29:07.703
All I have to do
is stay out of your sight.

476
00:29:07.703 --> 00:29:09.339
Why are you acting out of character?

477
00:29:09.339 --> 00:29:11.390
Do you believe what you're saying?

478
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.203
Have I ever asked you for anything?

479
00:29:13.203 --> 00:29:16.883
You have no interest in me,
so why are you doing this to me?

480
00:29:16.883 --> 00:29:20.164
Because you're my mom?
Because we're family?

481
00:29:20.164 --> 00:29:23.444
- Kim Bom.
- I don't know what family is.

482
00:29:24.103 --> 00:29:26.713
You raised me this way,
so what do you expect from me?

483
00:29:26.713 --> 00:29:28.164
What would I expect?

484
00:29:28.164 --> 00:29:30.683
Just live like a normal
high school student.

485
00:29:30.683 --> 00:29:33.864
Go to school, study, and don't upset me.

486
00:29:33.864 --> 00:29:36.082
Is that what seems normal to you?

487
00:29:36.082 --> 00:29:39.076
That kind of thing is so hard for me.

488
00:29:40.133 --> 00:29:41.492
Know what to expect.

489
00:29:43.332 --> 00:29:44.762
<i>Bom didn't come.</i>

490
00:29:46.434 --> 00:29:49.702
<i>Bom didn't come,
and my heart felt like winter.</i>

491
00:30:25.185 --> 00:30:27.119
<i>At the end of that trip...</i>

492
00:30:28.478 --> 00:30:31.529
<i>I felt like I had been betrayed.</i>

493
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.448
Are you all right?

494
00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:37.009
Take a deep breath.

495
00:31:34.507 --> 00:31:36.684
<i>I watched those two people
crying so hard.</i>

496
00:31:36.684 --> 00:31:41.088
<i>There was something I felt sorry about.</i>

497
00:31:42.742 --> 00:31:43.780
<i>Also...</i>

498
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.040
<i>I knew...</i>

499
00:31:51.322 --> 00:31:53.290
<i>what I needed to say to Bom.</i>

500
00:32:01.194 --> 00:32:02.961
<i>I need to see you now.</i>

501
00:32:02.961 --> 00:32:05.379
<i>Where are you? Where are you right now?</i>

502
00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:16.061
<i>Bom had remembered.</i>

503
00:32:19.398 --> 00:32:21.553
<i>That moment we first met.</i>

504
00:32:31.085 --> 00:32:33.236
Did you have a good trip?

505
00:32:33.236 --> 00:32:34.255
Yes.

506
00:32:35.473 --> 00:32:37.875
I waited a long time
this morning at the terminal.

507
00:32:37.875 --> 00:32:40.115
I went to the terminal.

508
00:32:40.115 --> 00:32:42.345
I was late, and you were gone.

509
00:32:42.345 --> 00:32:44.023
You should've called.

510
00:32:44.023 --> 00:32:45.980
I thought about it.

511
00:32:54.988 --> 00:32:58.037
<i>I didn't need to say anything cool.</i>

512
00:32:58.037 --> 00:32:59.281
About us dating...

513
00:32:59.281 --> 00:33:02.182
<i>I didn't need to practice either.</i>

514
00:33:02.182 --> 00:33:03.942
I want to give you my answer now.

515
00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:11.890
Okay.

516
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:14.732
Let's date.

517
00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:24.484
Okay.

518
00:33:34.838 --> 00:33:38.296
If you call me crying,
I'll run to you like crazy.

519
00:33:39.515 --> 00:33:40.578
Okay.

520
00:33:42.415 --> 00:33:44.575
<i>One word that bonded us was enough.</i>

521
00:33:48.278 --> 00:33:50.647
<i>Okay. Let's date.</i>

522
00:34:01.427 --> 00:34:05.538
The reason I taught you
how to play Go-Stop...

523
00:34:06.857 --> 00:34:08.769
was because it's something I'm good at.

524
00:34:10.279 --> 00:34:12.529
I had fun doing it too.

525
00:34:13.707 --> 00:34:15.497
But, getting paid to do it...

526
00:34:17.727 --> 00:34:21.513
It's true that I have no money,
but getting paid to do it...

527
00:34:22.664 --> 00:34:24.209
I felt really bad.

528
00:34:25.144 --> 00:34:30.135
I used 10,000 won to eat hamburgers
and have drinks with my friend.

529
00:34:31.254 --> 00:34:32.714
I'll pay you back.

530
00:34:41.834 --> 00:34:44.396
I want you to have this.

531
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.040
<i>[Class President]</i>

532
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.334
<i>Hey, Bernard.</i>

533
00:35:23.334 --> 00:35:25.522
<i>What's up with you and Bom?</i>

534
00:35:25.522 --> 00:35:28.644
You and Bom were in charge of the dance,
but you ruined it.

535
00:35:28.644 --> 00:35:30.586
Now, you've left us hanging.

536
00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:32.053
I never said I'd be in charge.

537
00:35:32.053 --> 00:35:36.113
Nonetheless, we can't dance,
so we need to do something else.

538
00:35:36.113 --> 00:35:37.678
Why do we have to?

539
00:35:37.678 --> 00:35:40.432
Shi Kyung and Bom might not
be used to these things.

540
00:35:40.432 --> 00:35:41.479
They're from Seoul.

541
00:35:41.479 --> 00:35:44.365
Also, they're both busy lately.

542
00:35:45.334 --> 00:35:46.401
Why?

543
00:35:46.401 --> 00:35:51.787
By chance, are you two dating?

544
00:35:51.787 --> 00:35:54.403
Yes... why?

545
00:35:54.403 --> 00:35:56.240
Wow!

546
00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.519
Chicken, chicken!

547
00:35:57.519 --> 00:35:59.867
Chicken, chicken! Yes!

548
00:36:02.015 --> 00:36:04.296
- Chicken, chicken!
- Calm down, would you?

549
00:36:04.296 --> 00:36:05.910
Chicken, chicken, chicken!

550
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.361
Why are they acting like this?

551
00:36:07.361 --> 00:36:11.100
The vice-principal said she'd treat the
class with the first couple to chicken.

552
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.419
Bernard, you figure out what we're
going to do for our talent by tomorrow.

553
00:36:16.245 --> 00:36:18.135
Meet here again tomorrow.

554
00:36:21.156 --> 00:36:22.405
Joo Yeon.

555
00:36:30.531 --> 00:36:33.555
Hey, you've got a pretty big mouth.

556
00:36:33.555 --> 00:36:36.194
All I did was say that
you guys were busy.

557
00:36:37.211 --> 00:36:40.771
I thought it was a joke,
but there really has never been a couple?

558
00:36:40.771 --> 00:36:42.472
That's not it.

559
00:36:42.472 --> 00:36:45.691
There was one couple.
They attended long ago and got married.

560
00:36:46.482 --> 00:36:49.113
We're all like family though.

561
00:36:49.113 --> 00:36:50.805
Family can't date each other.

562
00:36:53.367 --> 00:36:54.488
I'm hungry.

563
00:36:54.488 --> 00:36:56.986
Right? You're hungry?

564
00:36:56.986 --> 00:36:59.658
- Should we go eat something?
- I have to go to the hospice.

565
00:36:59.658 --> 00:37:01.278
My dad wants me to come.

566
00:37:01.278 --> 00:37:03.196
- I'm going to go.
- Wait.

567
00:37:04.435 --> 00:37:06.245
I need to drop by the hospice too.

568
00:37:06.245 --> 00:37:09.046
Why do you need to go?
Didn't you go earlier?

569
00:37:09.046 --> 00:37:11.696
Find a place like last time,
and send me a picture.

570
00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:13.589
That was fun.

571
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:14.676
Okay.

572
00:37:17.682 --> 00:37:20.926
Is that true?
What do you like about Shi Kyung?

573
00:37:20.926 --> 00:37:23.222
I mean how long have you liked him?

574
00:37:24.131 --> 00:37:27.276
Ever since he got on his knees
in front of Yong Gi.

575
00:37:27.276 --> 00:37:30.021
What? Why then?

576
00:37:30.021 --> 00:37:33.066
He looked so cool then.

577
00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:37.111
Were you the one who sent that note?

578
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:41.961
Yes, I was worried that he might
actually be a bully gangster.

579
00:37:41.961 --> 00:37:43.390
Suk Joo Yeon, you...

580
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.593
I'm so envious of you.

581
00:37:47.593 --> 00:37:49.798
I want to like someone, too.

582
00:37:49.798 --> 00:37:52.990
I don't mean Park Bo Gum,
but like in real life.

583
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.064
Oh, girl.

584
00:37:56.633 --> 00:37:58.321
What do you think about Yong Gi?

585
00:37:58.321 --> 00:38:00.397
Ji Hye and Yong Gi
sound very good together.

586
00:38:00.397 --> 00:38:03.582
Hey! Yong Gi is scary.

587
00:38:04.622 --> 00:38:06.593
Then Ga Ram?

588
00:38:16.544 --> 00:38:20.778
What in the world happened?
What happened?

589
00:38:20.778 --> 00:38:22.798
- Seriously...
- Please be quiet.

590
00:38:22.798 --> 00:38:24.354
Your mother-in-law just fell asleep.

591
00:38:34.214 --> 00:38:36.155
<i>Oh, what am I going to do?</i>

592
00:38:37.653 --> 00:38:39.861
<i>Come to my job.</i>

593
00:38:39.861 --> 00:38:40.955
What now?

594
00:38:50.729 --> 00:38:51.772
What is this?

595
00:38:51.772 --> 00:38:54.830
The 10,000 won I took from you before.

596
00:38:55.899 --> 00:38:57.432
Just trying to say thanks.

597
00:38:58.312 --> 00:39:00.727
You see? Your brother is the best.

598
00:39:00.727 --> 00:39:01.789
No way.

599
00:39:03.151 --> 00:39:06.086
Oh yeah, have you apologized to Grandma?

600
00:39:06.086 --> 00:39:07.617
Why would I?

601
00:39:07.617 --> 00:39:12.707
Grandma stays late at the hospice or
with a friend every night because of you.

602
00:39:12.707 --> 00:39:14.115
Why is that because of me?

603
00:39:14.115 --> 00:39:15.274
Grandma is just busy.

604
00:39:15.274 --> 00:39:20.283
I clearly heard her say that you like it
when she comes home late.

605
00:39:20.283 --> 00:39:21.430
Be good to her.

606
00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:27.401
Where is this?

607
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:30.771
There is a river behind the school.
It looks like that.

608
00:39:30.771 --> 00:39:32.211
Behind the school?

609
00:39:36.743 --> 00:39:38.175
You're going to see Bom, right?

610
00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:40.044
I heard you two are dating.

611
00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:44.006
It takes one minute and 30 seconds
for a rumor to spread in this school.

612
00:39:44.006 --> 00:39:47.294
What is with Bom's taste in men?

613
00:39:48.705 --> 00:39:49.966
That girl...

614
00:39:57.345 --> 00:39:58.370
Huh?

615
00:40:00.198 --> 00:40:01.222
Billions of won?

616
00:40:02.894 --> 00:40:04.785
Why do you have this then?

617
00:40:06.171 --> 00:40:07.196
I don't know why.

618
00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.051
Take this. Hurry up, and accept it.

619
00:40:13.214 --> 00:40:14.624
You're kidding, right?

620
00:40:17.124 --> 00:40:18.647
Why would you give this to me?

621
00:40:19.568 --> 00:40:22.053
Don't tell anyone about it.

622
00:40:22.053 --> 00:40:24.830
It will be a big problem
if my kids find out about it.

623
00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.798
No, I don't want it.

624
00:40:27.747 --> 00:40:29.578
Mother.

625
00:40:32.593 --> 00:40:35.354
I heard that you have your appetite back.

626
00:40:35.354 --> 00:40:37.921
I brought you the black sesame porridge
that you like so much.

627
00:40:37.921 --> 00:40:40.272
I ground it up very fine.

628
00:40:40.272 --> 00:40:41.410
I don't want it.

629
00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:44.002
You may have poisoned it.

630
00:40:44.002 --> 00:40:47.048
Hey, don't be like that again.

631
00:40:47.048 --> 00:40:51.042
Don't be that way, and have some
while it's still warm.

632
00:40:51.042 --> 00:40:53.877
Mother, ahh...

633
00:40:57.352 --> 00:41:00.810
Mother, why are you being this way to me?

634
00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.071
Hey, lady!

635
00:41:03.071 --> 00:41:05.604
I heard that you threw iced coffee
in my little sister's face.

636
00:41:05.604 --> 00:41:07.546
Hey! Which school do you attend?

637
00:41:07.546 --> 00:41:09.021
Who's your homeroom teacher?

638
00:41:09.021 --> 00:41:12.823
How is it that even the kids here
are so shabby?

639
00:41:12.823 --> 00:41:15.852
Hey, call your parents right now?

640
00:41:15.852 --> 00:41:18.310
Oh... that lady.

641
00:41:19.111 --> 00:41:20.861
Oh, you!

642
00:41:20.861 --> 00:41:22.095
Shi Kyung, you can go.

643
00:41:23.941 --> 00:41:24.963
Yes.

644
00:41:37.439 --> 00:41:38.490
Hey.

645
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.104
What do you want?

646
00:41:42.104 --> 00:41:44.312
Lower your voice.
What are you doing here?

647
00:41:44.312 --> 00:41:45.624
Who are you anyway?

648
00:41:45.624 --> 00:41:48.100
Why are you hanging around
my mother-in-law?

649
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.060
- What do you want?
- Hey, lady!

650
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.131
You'll get hurt if you act out of turn.
Don't mess around.

651
00:41:57.187 --> 00:41:59.091
<i>Who is she anyway?</i>

652
00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:01.142
That's what I'm saying.

653
00:42:02.673 --> 00:42:05.508
What's her reason
for hanging around that grandma?

654
00:42:06.272 --> 00:42:07.622
What does she want?

655
00:42:07.622 --> 00:42:10.370
She's interrogating you about things
she feels guilty about.

656
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.459
I think so.

657
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.870
Are you going to keep this ring?

658
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.680
No! I would never do that.

659
00:42:19.769 --> 00:42:23.941
I went back to return it to her.

660
00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.191
But, she wasn't conscious.

661
00:42:26.394 --> 00:42:27.470
I'm worried about her.

662
00:42:31.278 --> 00:42:32.774
It is very pretty.

663
00:43:02.499 --> 00:43:03.691
What are you doing?

664
00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:08.560
Hey!

665
00:43:17.229 --> 00:43:20.013
Where is the diamond ring?

666
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.535
What do I do?

667
00:43:29.146 --> 00:43:30.267
Where is it?

668
00:43:42.747 --> 00:43:44.238
Jung Won.

669
00:43:46.488 --> 00:43:47.627
Wait!

670
00:43:51.417 --> 00:43:53.852
You've been hiding something
from me, haven't you?

671
00:43:53.852 --> 00:43:55.539
No, I haven't.

672
00:43:55.539 --> 00:43:57.575
Tell me. What is it?

673
00:43:59.004 --> 00:44:02.526
I got a contract teaching position.

674
00:44:02.526 --> 00:44:03.606
Really?

675
00:44:03.606 --> 00:44:07.319
It's too early to be happy about it.
I have to take a test teaching a class.

676
00:44:07.319 --> 00:44:10.314
I have to pass that test to get hired.

677
00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:12.778
- But...
- But what?

678
00:44:12.778 --> 00:44:15.836
It happens to be Shi Kyung
and Shi Young's class.

679
00:44:15.836 --> 00:44:18.017
Oh, that's great.

680
00:44:18.017 --> 00:44:19.758
The student body numbers are very small.

681
00:44:19.758 --> 00:44:24.078
I feel so nervous thinking about
teaching Shi Kyung and Shi Young.

682
00:44:25.258 --> 00:44:26.334
How strange.

683
00:44:27.249 --> 00:44:30.588
Ah, you can just practice
in front of them.

684
00:44:30.588 --> 00:44:33.548
That would be a good method too.

685
00:44:33.548 --> 00:44:36.517
The song you are now listening to is...

686
00:44:36.517 --> 00:44:41.459
Tchaikovsky's String Quartet,
No.1, 2nd Movement...

687
00:44:41.459 --> 00:44:45.060
Do you think doing a cosplay
is a bad idea too?

688
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.649
You don't think it would go over well?

689
00:44:46.649 --> 00:44:48.651
I might give it a try
if it might go over well.

690
00:44:48.651 --> 00:44:50.354
I don't know.

691
00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:52.345
What is your group doing?

692
00:44:52.345 --> 00:44:55.225
I heard you and Bom are a burden
because you can't dance.

693
00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:58.638
I don't know.

694
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:03.607
Ah, I have to think about that too.

695
00:45:05.566 --> 00:45:08.113
Why won't you listen to me?

696
00:45:08.113 --> 00:45:11.493
Aunt, it's boring. I'm sleepy.

697
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:13.142
You're sleepy?

698
00:45:13.142 --> 00:45:15.035
Aunt, I'm sorry.

699
00:45:15.035 --> 00:45:16.707
I'm busy, and I think I have to go.

700
00:45:16.707 --> 00:45:18.133
No! Wait, wait.

701
00:45:18.133 --> 00:45:19.151
I have something to do.

702
00:45:19.151 --> 00:45:21.651
Just sit down for a bit. Wait for a bit.

703
00:45:21.651 --> 00:45:23.385
Practice in front of Grandma.

704
00:45:23.385 --> 00:45:26.725
If you can do it in front of Grandma,
you can do it in front of anyone.

705
00:45:26.725 --> 00:45:29.316
Just tell me to die instead.

706
00:45:31.117 --> 00:45:32.383
What about Grandma?

707
00:45:33.394 --> 00:45:35.591
Grandma is sleeping. What about her?

708
00:45:35.591 --> 00:45:38.211
Already? When did she get in?

709
00:45:38.211 --> 00:45:39.961
She went to bed as soon as she got in.

710
00:45:39.961 --> 00:45:42.073
Is she feeling unwell?

711
00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:45.553
Seriously? I have to do
something in the room.

712
00:45:45.553 --> 00:45:46.935
Do it out here.

713
00:45:46.935 --> 00:45:49.169
Don't turn on the light
when she's sleeping.

714
00:45:50.229 --> 00:45:52.903
Also, have you apologized to her?

715
00:45:52.903 --> 00:45:53.937
Gosh!

716
00:45:58.555 --> 00:46:00.441
When will she grow up?

717
00:46:00.441 --> 00:46:03.488
How about you? Is the practice helping?

718
00:46:03.488 --> 00:46:06.620
Jung Won, what am I going to do?

719
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.100
Why? It's not working out?

720
00:46:39.439 --> 00:46:42.339
<i>Grandma. It's me, Shi Young.</i>

721
00:47:03.312 --> 00:47:04.586
What are you doing?

722
00:47:07.676 --> 00:47:08.847
Hey!

723
00:47:43.247 --> 00:47:46.359
Where in the world is it! Where is it?

724
00:47:48.495 --> 00:47:49.716
Hey, crazy punk.

725
00:47:54.066 --> 00:47:56.156
Why are you always acting so crazy?

726
00:48:03.421 --> 00:48:04.535
Seriously...

727
00:48:06.084 --> 00:48:08.026
<i>Have you thought about the talent show?</i>

728
00:48:08.946 --> 00:48:10.926
I should think about it.

729
00:48:10.926 --> 00:48:14.135
Yeah... yeah.

730
00:48:18.164 --> 00:48:21.812
Ah... I don't have time to think
about the talent show.

731
00:48:26.687 --> 00:48:27.711
Huh?

732
00:48:42.972 --> 00:48:45.439
"A person who can laugh is great."

733
00:48:46.097 --> 00:48:49.042
"A person who can make one laugh
is even greater."

734
00:48:52.432 --> 00:48:54.796
<i>Mother, please come eat.</i>

735
00:48:54.796 --> 00:48:57.600
<i>Shi Young, you're not eating?</i>

736
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.943
<i>Have some breakfast.</i>

737
00:48:58.943 --> 00:49:00.763
<i>Hey, Shi Young!</i>

738
00:49:24.778 --> 00:49:26.705
<i>[To: Grandma]</i>

739
00:49:27.825 --> 00:49:28.885
<i>I feel nervous.</i>

740
00:49:28.885 --> 00:49:33.754
<i>What if I use Dad's idea, and it
turns out like the tombstone inscription?</i>

741
00:49:33.754 --> 00:49:35.834
What? You want to do what?

742
00:49:35.834 --> 00:49:40.106
Isn't that what old grandpas did
hundreds of years ago in the Stone Age?

743
00:49:40.106 --> 00:49:41.894
<i>What is this reaction?</i>

744
00:49:41.894 --> 00:49:44.711
Yes, it was hard to find.

745
00:49:46.385 --> 00:49:47.957
I couldn't sleep at all.

746
00:49:47.957 --> 00:49:50.736
I think the older patients would like it.

747
00:49:50.736 --> 00:49:51.745
It'll be funny.

748
00:49:51.745 --> 00:49:55.430
Lee Shi Kyung, are you really from Seoul?

749
00:49:56.763 --> 00:49:58.370
I totally love it.

750
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:02.187
I really love these types of things.

751
00:50:02.187 --> 00:50:03.921
I think it'll be fun too.

752
00:50:03.921 --> 00:50:05.912
The dance will be easy, so that's good.

753
00:50:05.912 --> 00:50:07.517
<i>The response is good!</i>

754
00:50:07.517 --> 00:50:10.655
<i>Dad, it's working this time.</i>

755
00:50:10.655 --> 00:50:13.883
Why not go for a tourist bus version?

756
00:50:13.883 --> 00:50:15.305
With some tacky music.

757
00:50:15.305 --> 00:50:17.577
That's a great idea!
We should use that kind of music.

758
00:50:18.675 --> 00:50:20.455
<i>Oh, wait.</i>

759
00:50:20.455 --> 00:50:22.524
<i>Why am I acting like this?</i>

760
00:50:36.314 --> 00:50:37.325
Where's Shi Kyung?

761
00:50:38.064 --> 00:50:39.214
Did he already leave?

762
00:50:40.312 --> 00:50:42.008
I think he went to the hospice.

763
00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.778
Is something going on with Shi Kyung?

764
00:50:51.287 --> 00:50:54.732
<i>Grandma Ring is not awake yet.</i>

765
00:50:56.336 --> 00:50:58.142
<i>What should I do?</i>

766
00:50:58.142 --> 00:50:59.597
Lee Shi Kyung.

767
00:51:03.546 --> 00:51:05.740
Here is some soybean paste soup.

768
00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.173
Wow! You made this all yourself?

769
00:51:08.173 --> 00:51:09.252
Of course.

770
00:51:10.385 --> 00:51:11.754
Did you close the door well?

771
00:51:12.714 --> 00:51:14.502
The door? Why?

772
00:51:17.002 --> 00:51:19.077
The patients can't eat very well.

773
00:51:19.077 --> 00:51:21.606
I would feel bad if the smell got out.

774
00:51:21.606 --> 00:51:25.638
Sometimes when I'm busy,
Ga Ram and I eat here like this.

775
00:51:25.638 --> 00:51:29.776
All right, then. Let's eat.

776
00:51:29.776 --> 00:51:31.321
Thank you for the food.

777
00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:33.231
- Okay.
- Thank you.

778
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.142
The fish turned out very well.

779
00:51:39.307 --> 00:51:41.850
Ga Ram, here you go.

780
00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:44.832
- Be careful of the little bones.
- Okay.

781
00:51:49.055 --> 00:51:51.289
The fish was grilled so well.

782
00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.414
- Shi Kyung.
- Yes?

783
00:51:56.218 --> 00:51:57.557
Here you go.

784
00:51:59.604 --> 00:52:02.274
Here. Eat up lots.

785
00:52:08.022 --> 00:52:09.124
One moment.

786
00:52:15.046 --> 00:52:18.693
<i>So, that's what a father is.</i>

787
00:52:20.263 --> 00:52:23.727
<i>In times like this,
I wish I had a father too.</i>

788
00:52:29.156 --> 00:52:32.044
My mother-in-law's ring is gone.
Where is he?

789
00:52:32.044 --> 00:52:34.734
Where is the boy who was
hanging around her room?

790
00:52:34.734 --> 00:52:37.678
We don't know much about
our patients' personal lives.

791
00:52:37.678 --> 00:52:40.057
Report it to the police
if you're so suspicious.

792
00:52:40.057 --> 00:52:42.796
You refer to them as family
and not patients.

793
00:52:42.796 --> 00:52:44.272
Now, you're going to act this way?

794
00:52:44.272 --> 00:52:46.633
Shouldn't you have reported it
to the police first?

795
00:52:46.633 --> 00:52:48.796
Your mother-in-law may have done
something with it.

796
00:52:48.796 --> 00:52:50.417
Ask her once she wakes up.

797
00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:51.879
You don't know what you're saying.

798
00:52:51.879 --> 00:52:54.490
I've never seen her with her ring off.

799
00:52:57.789 --> 00:53:07.789

807
00:53:29.035 --> 00:53:30.390
<i>Thank you.</i>

808
00:53:31.537 --> 00:53:33.133
<i>For coming to see me.</i>

809
00:53:33.133 --> 00:53:35.321
<i>Where did you find this ring?</i>

810
00:53:35.321 --> 00:53:37.495
<i>We couldn't find it
when we looked so hard.</i>

811
00:53:37.495 --> 00:53:39.848
<i>It was stuck in the dirt,
so I had to clean it off.</i>

812
00:53:43.377 --> 00:53:46.948
<i>My Shi Yoon always used to do that dance.</i>
