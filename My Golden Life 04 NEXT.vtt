(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.149
They're...

4
00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.319
your real parents, Ji An.

5
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.200
(Episode 4)

6
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.500
A long time ago,

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.070
25 years ago,

8
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.770
Ji Soo's twin sister died.

9
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.309
We found you on the way back from her grave.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.239
I had no idea your real parents were alive.

11
00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.109
We thought that someone abandoned you.

12
00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.080
Mom,

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.389
what are you talking about? What nonsense...

14
00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:50.419
I couldn't bring myself to tell her. She had no idea.

15
00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:52.819
Even if I told her,

16
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.929
she wouldn't have believed me right away.

17
00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.859
And it was easier for me to tell her...

18
00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:59.959
in front of you.

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.129
It'd be easier for Ji An to believe me this way.

20
00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.870
What are you doing, Mom?

21
00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:09.309
Eun Seok.

22
00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:17.519
Then enjoy your time together.

23
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.090
- Eun Seok. - Eun Seok.

24
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.799
Sit down.

25
00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:34.200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Stop her.

27
00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:45.224
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

28
00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:55.019
We should've waited.

29
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.990
Her mother should have talked to her first...

30
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.029
and given her some time.

31
00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:03.430
She must know anyway. That's not important.

32
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.900
Eun Seok needs time to accept it.

33
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.669
Father told us to bring Eun Seok home.

34
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.399
Does he know already?

35
00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.639
Of course.

36
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.269
You saw it too.

37
00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.380
The way she dresses and eats.

38
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.310
She should never eat first even if she's hungry.

39
00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:25.880
She has a lot to work on.

40
00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.989
Shall we get the food heated?

41
00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.889
You don't eat cold food.

42
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.489
How could I eat now?

43
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.160
Then let's go home.

44
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.089
Mom.

45
00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.919
Why did you leave so early?

46
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.119
They must really want to talk with you.

47
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.190
I...

48
00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.530
I have nothing to talk about.

49
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.000
I know you can't believe it.

50
00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:16.600
You probably can't.

51
00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:19.399
But it's true.

52
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.070
How can it be true?

53
00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.380
No. It can't be true.

54
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.810
They want to take you back.

55
00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.709
It's obvious.

56
00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.519
They found their daughter whom we took.

57
00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.950
It's right for them to take you,

58
00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.489
and you should go too.

59
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.329
Is it true...

60
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.630
that they're my real parents?

61
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.470
You and Dad aren't my real parents?

62
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.940
Do you think...

63
00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.169
I can fool them?

64
00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.440
They're vice-chairman and wife of Haesung...

65
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.410
where you got fired after working on a contract.

66
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.480
How did this happen?

67
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.220
You're smart. You heard it all.

68
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.959
Can't you remember?

69
00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.220
Mom.

70
00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:15.829
Before the family finds out,

71
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.130
make up your mind.

72
00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.399
When you do, I'll tell the family.

73
00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:23.870
Don't tell anyone.

74
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.969
Don't ask for opinions. Especially your dad.

75
00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:30.339
He's working hard away from home...

76
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.740
to make 1,500 dollars a month.

77
00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.310
How would he feel when he finds out?

78
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.479
What decision are you talking about?

79
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.789
Why do I need to make up my mind?

80
00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:42.889
The people...

81
00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.519
you thought as your own parents...

82
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.930
took someone else's lost child, and raised her...

83
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.659
without reporting it.

84
00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.000
What would her parents do?

85
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.599
They wouldn't let it go.

86
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.170
Think about it. That will be easier.

87
00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.170
Mom. That bus doesn't go home.

88
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.209
I'm meeting Hae Ja.

89
00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.860
Mother and Father went out for brunch.

90
00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:27.990
But it's Saturday.

91
00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:29.389
I know.

92
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.899
Last Sunday of every month,

93
00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:32.360
at Hotel Sera.

94
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.969
That's the only day they went out.

95
00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:36.969
General Manager Min.

96
00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.240
Is it just the two of them at today's brunch?

97
00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:42.839
No. They went to meet Eun Seok.

98
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.979
They went to meet Eun Seok?

99
00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.740
I can't believe it.

100
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.250
They didn't tell us anything about how...

101
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.820
they lost and found her.

102
00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:53.250
Is there a secret or something?

103
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.889
They'll tell us when it's time. Let's eat.

104
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.229
Where were you?

105
00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:09.769
I thought you went out with Mom.

106
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.700
No.

107
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.570
Then where did Mom go?

108
00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:16.810
What's that, Ji Tae?

109
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.380
It's my own recipe of rabokki.

110
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.550
I was starving, but there was nothing to eat.

111
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.950
And Mom told me to cook for myself.

112
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.649
She told me to cook. That's nonsense.

113
00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:30.860
I haven't had this for so long.

114
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.289
Even when Mom made food before she went out,

115
00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:35.289
you always made this for us.

116
00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:37.930
Mom always wanted to be a good mother.

117
00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.860
"Ham? No way."

118
00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:42.000
"Ramyeon? Never."

119
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.099
"I'll never allow any instant foods..."

120
00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:45.570
"such as pizza or dumplings."

121
00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:48.310
"This is Mom's own cheonggukjang."

122
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.240
"I made this doenjang myself."

123
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.610
I always had spinach and anchovies.

124
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.349
I'm so sick of jangjorim.

125
00:07:56.649 --> 00:07:59.149
I hated the carrots in her curry the most.

126
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.320
Mom beat me so much...

127
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.260
for making rabokki when she wasn't home.

128
00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:05.789
Right.

129
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.190
Let's eat before it gets soggy.

130
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.700
Oh, my. It's been so long.

131
00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:18.099
What do you think? Does it taste the same?

132
00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:19.099
Yes.

133
00:08:20.269 --> 00:08:23.610
But don't you think this is too much?

134
00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:28.110
Not at all. You eat so much.

135
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.820
I can't believe she doesn't gain any weight.

136
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.190
When I was young, Mom and Dad always said...

137
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.290
Ji Soo eats so well, so I tried to catch up.

138
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.489
Then I got sick.

139
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.859
Still, Dad beat me for it.

140
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.560
Dad went pretty easy on us, but he was...

141
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.400
strict on you because you are the eldest.

142
00:08:52.469 --> 00:08:53.839
Try this, Ji An.

143
00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.979
How did you make this? This is so good.

144
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.879
I'll have some snacks.

145
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.249
Did you get a call from Mr. Sun?

146
00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:10.790
No, I didn't get any calls.

147
00:09:11.219 --> 00:09:13.089
Then you should give up.

148
00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:16.060
Hey, don't be so negative.

149
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.259
Act like an older sister.

150
00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:21.369
Don't be like that.

151
00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:26.339
You said Mr. Sun rides a bike.

152
00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:28.209
That means he lives nearby.

153
00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.479
Search all interior companies nearby.

154
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.410
There won't be so many Mr. Suns.

155
00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.450
You're right.

156
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.119
Why didn't I think of that?

157
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.320
What are you going to do without me, Ji Soo?

158
00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:47.219
You can't live without me, can you?

159
00:09:51.229 --> 00:09:52.959
Hey, you're choking me.

160
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:57.900
I shouldn't have eaten. My face will swell up.

161
00:09:57.999 --> 00:09:59.570
I'll take digestive medicine.

162
00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:15.290
(Victim)

163
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.589
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

164
00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:22.989
What is she doing?

165
00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:25.660
She rejected my call.

166
00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:27.499
She pressed the reject button.

167
00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:31.200
I wasn't going to make her pay.

168
00:10:31.239 --> 00:10:32.400
Why won't she pick up...

169
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.640
when I'm trying to let it go?

170
00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:43.879
You're home.

171
00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:48.550
Why did you rush out last night?

172
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.989
I had to work on something.

173
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.219
Don't make any scandals.

174
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.829
You should be careful.

175
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:57.259
We also need to work on Eun Seok now.

176
00:10:58.329 --> 00:11:01.530
Did you two go out to meet Eun Seok?

177
00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:04.999
Yes.

178
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.940
Then tell me.

179
00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:10.170
How did you find her?

180
00:11:11.109 --> 00:11:12.479
And what will you do now?

181
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.420
We found the person who took her because of...

182
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.219
the diamond in her hairpin and abandoned her.

183
00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:28.560
How?

184
00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:30.259
Seo Hyun.

185
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.700
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.229
What about Eun Seok?

187
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.070
How is she doing?

188
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.239
She worked as a contract employee...

189
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.609
at our company until a little while ago.

190
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.680
At our company?

191
00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:49.579
There are people who raised her,

192
00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:51.249
thinking that she had been abandoned.

193
00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:54.290
She's been living thinking that they're her parents.

194
00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.759
They're not well-off, but she graduated university.

195
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.160
What will you do now?

196
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.690
We should bring her.

197
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.660
Did she say she'd live here?

198
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.530
Don't be rude. She'll live here with us, of course.

199
00:12:11.869 --> 00:12:14.640
She only found out today that we're her parents.

200
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.709
It must've been a big shock to her.

201
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.609
She'll be here in a few days, but you need to...

202
00:12:19.609 --> 00:12:21.979
watch what you say until the right time comes.

203
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.349
Someone named Ms. Oh is here to see you.

204
00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:31.259
She said you're expecting her.

205
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.420
Tell her to come in.

206
00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:37.930
The main color should be white.

207
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.800
Let's go with the French modern style.

208
00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.930
Sure. What about furniture?

209
00:12:44.369 --> 00:12:46.900
Please get a list ready. We'll go from there.

210
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:48.609
Ji An.

211
00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:52.640
What's gotten into her? It's past midnight.

212
00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:53.739
Why is she still up?

213
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.979
Hey, I'm doing something very important right now.

214
00:12:55.979 --> 00:12:59.119
That's why I'm not in bed yet, you brat.

215
00:13:00.349 --> 00:13:02.950
Oh, it looks like you thought I'd be sleeping...

216
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.719
and bought food only for Ji An.

217
00:13:05.859 --> 00:13:07.989
I see that it's from a department store!

218
00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:10.030
What is it? You better give it to me.

219
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.900
Not a chance.

220
00:13:13.729 --> 00:13:14.900
It's for Ji An.

221
00:13:14.999 --> 00:13:16.200
For me?

222
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:17.969
What is it?

223
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.170
Your one and only pair of dress shoes...

224
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.670
is completely worn out, you know.

225
00:13:24.579 --> 00:13:26.780
You got this at a department store?

226
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.709
You don't have money to spend like this.

227
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.379
I've been saving up the pocket money you gave me.

228
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.790
Wear them on your interviews.

229
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.959
Women always have to wear nice shoes and purses.

230
00:13:41.089 --> 00:13:42.089
You know that?

231
00:13:42.129 --> 00:13:44.129
You probably didn't. You didn't know, did you?

232
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.660
You're right. I didn't know.

233
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.430
My, they're gorgeous. Where's mine?

234
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.339
Don't even try.

235
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.900
Have you even given me a dollar?

236
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.339
Forget it. I'll just borrow Ji An's.

237
00:13:58.979 --> 00:14:01.180
By the way, where's Mom? Mi Jung,

238
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.219
Mi Jung, Ms. Yang Mi Jung.

239
00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:07.050
Why, why? Why isn't she home yet?

240
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.420
Where's Mom?

241
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.030
You wench!

242
00:14:21.469 --> 00:14:23.469
What on earth are you wearing?

243
00:14:23.469 --> 00:14:25.469
This world is a scary place. How daring!

244
00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:28.640
Don't you think the light is making me look sexier?

245
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.550
Look at you. I can tell that you know.

246
00:14:36.849 --> 00:14:39.349
You picked up on what I'm about to tell you.

247
00:14:41.349 --> 00:14:43.820
That's right. I've decided not to go to that family.

248
00:14:44.359 --> 00:14:47.020
I've lived here for 25 years, so this is my home.

249
00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:48.930
And you and Dad, whom I've lived with for 25 years,

250
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.930
are my parents.

251
00:14:50.229 --> 00:14:52.629
The same goes for Ji Soo, Ji Ho, and Ji Tae.

252
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:54.099
They're my siblings and family.

253
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:56.070
Hence, I've decided not to go.

254
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.540
You want to stay?

255
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.239
Yes.

256
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.739
After being through so much,

257
00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:07.780
you still want to stay?

258
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.320
Why? Why would you do that?

259
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.150
I already told you.

260
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.920
You've always wanted to become a sculptor.

261
00:15:16.719 --> 00:15:18.959
You wanted to go to the art school in Chicago.

262
00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:22.160
That family can send you abroad for your studies.

263
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.530
Go to them, and ask them to send you abroad.

264
00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:28.829
- I can study abroad? - Yes, you can.

265
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.200
You won't have to worry about finding a job.

266
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.810
Right, my birth parents are corporate riches,

267
00:15:35.239 --> 00:15:36.869
so they won't neglect me.

268
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.680
You can get...

269
00:15:41.379 --> 00:15:43.249
financial support from your rich parents.

270
00:15:43.249 --> 00:15:44.920
Is that why you want to stay with us?

271
00:15:44.979 --> 00:15:47.690
Because you'll be at ease even though we're poor?

272
00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:50.520
How can you say it like that?

273
00:15:50.619 --> 00:15:52.060
What if they neglect you?

274
00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:55.560
What if they don't help you if you stay with us?

275
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.930
What will you do then?

276
00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.329
Will you be okay? Will you be able to live like now?

277
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.300
I'll be fine.

278
00:16:03.599 --> 00:16:05.339
I've been fine until now.

279
00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:06.839
Have you really been fine?

280
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.009
You got a part-time job right after you got fired.

281
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:12.579
"I'm struggling." You've basically been protesting,

282
00:16:12.579 --> 00:16:14.709
and even just seeing you has been stressing me out.

283
00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:16.749
And what? You're okay, and you've been fine?

284
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.650
Seeing me has been stressing you out?

285
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.290
Mom, I've been doing my very best not to show it.

286
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.020
You felt like I was protesting?

287
00:16:28.859 --> 00:16:30.160
You're a burden to us.

288
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.560
Let us have one less person to feed.

289
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.599
Mom.

290
00:16:34.599 --> 00:16:37.540
You know our financial situation the best.

291
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.239
You know it better than anyone else.

292
00:16:39.739 --> 00:16:40.969
Was that the reason?

293
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.640
Because I'm not your real daughter?

294
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.579
I had to take out a loan and work part-time...

295
00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:47.950
to pay my tuition fees.

296
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.879
I spent years worrying about finding a job.

297
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.450
But Ji Soo.

298
00:16:52.719 --> 00:16:54.349
She was coddled, even when she did badly in school.

299
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.290
You were fine with her just working part-time.

300
00:16:57.589 --> 00:16:58.959
Was that the reason?

301
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.489
It wasn't intentional,

302
00:17:03.259 --> 00:17:05.559
but it's possible that I favored her unconsciously.

303
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.729
How can it be so easy for you...

304
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.670
to tell me to leave?

305
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.940
Because I have no other choice.

306
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.239
We took you without even reporting to the police.

307
00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:20.850
We stole someone else's daughter.

308
00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:22.380
I'm so scared.

309
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.249
And they happen to own Haesung Corporation.

310
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.450
If someone stole my kid, I wouldn't let it slide.

311
00:17:28.749 --> 00:17:30.620
Are you telling me to go because you're scared?

312
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:32.590
If you go to them, they'll forgive us.

313
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.529
The rest of our family needs to live too.

314
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.529
The rest...

315
00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.160
of our family?

316
00:17:39.459 --> 00:17:42.170
Whether you go or not, I must tell your siblings.

317
00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:45.039
You don't think they'd feel distanced from you?

318
00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:46.670
They won't.

319
00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:51.239
Things can't be like before anymore.

320
00:17:52.209 --> 00:17:54.209
Mom, frankly...

321
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.019
To be honest, I can't even believe it.

322
00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.489
I can't say anything because it seems true,

323
00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:06.390
but I can't leave this house.

324
00:18:07.259 --> 00:18:08.630
I don't want to.

325
00:18:09.959 --> 00:18:11.200
So please, Mom.

326
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.700
Let's just live like this, okay?

327
00:18:18.739 --> 00:18:20.140
Mom, please.

328
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.759
That plus 250 dollars equals 6,140 dollars.

329
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.700
I owe Ha Jung 5,000 dollars...

330
00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.440
and another 5,000 for the repair. In total, 10,000.

331
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.069
If I subtract 6,140 dollars...

332
00:18:53.069 --> 00:18:55.739
It's 3,860 dollars.

333
00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:57.039
Text me your bank account...

334
00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:58.279
and what I owe you now.

335
00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.610
Gosh, I really need to tame my temper.

336
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.350
3,860 dollars...

337
00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:17.029
Hello?

338
00:19:17.729 --> 00:19:19.499
Hey. It's me, Ji An.

339
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.930
I know. You don't need to tell me who you are.

340
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.269
Just tell me when I can expect the money from you.

341
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.739
I can visit the HR team and sign the papers today.

342
00:19:27.739 --> 00:19:28.870
Today?

343
00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:31.110
You'll come to the office today?

344
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.539
Yes, but...

345
00:19:34.509 --> 00:19:37.249
Can I see you briefly? I want to talk to you.

346
00:19:37.249 --> 00:19:39.519
Sure. Then come to my office afterwards.

347
00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:41.719
To your office?

348
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.959
I'll see you later!

349
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.390
Where are you going?

350
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.559
I have an interview for a part-time position.

351
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.229
Hey!

352
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.910
She said she doesn't want to live with us?

353
00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:05.880
You don't need to tell me that, Ms. Yang.

354
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.549
I know that much.

355
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.850
Anyway, all right. I have to go.

356
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:20.360
She doesn't want to live with us?

357
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.400
(Resume)

358
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.330
You have experience in sales and modeling.

359
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.739
You can converse in English as well.

360
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.700
Arrive by 8am tomorrow for your shift.

361
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.940
Sure, that's no problem. Thank you.

362
00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:45.819
Yes, Choi Do Kyung speaking.

363
00:20:45.979 --> 00:20:47.150
Did you see the news?

364
00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:50.319
Why? Did your company secure an investment?

365
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.620
Kim Jin Seok from Saebom Industries?

366
00:20:57.229 --> 00:20:58.499
("A Corporate Heir Causes...")

367
00:20:58.499 --> 00:20:59.799
("a Scene at a Bar Again")

368
00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:01.269
Your hunch was right.

369
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.999
I'm glad that we kicked him out.

370
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.140
I knew he'd get himself in a mess like that.

371
00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:08.440
You should be relaxed when you have a lot.

372
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.380
Why did he lose it like that? He has no class.

373
00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:13.479
I heard from a reporter who's my drinking buddy...

374
00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:15.650
that they're collecting tips for stories...

375
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:16.880
of abusive corporate heirs.

376
00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.479
Gosh, that'll make us innocent ones suffer.

377
00:21:20.749 --> 00:21:22.489
You're a third-generation corporate heir?

378
00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:23.850
Good for you.

379
00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:26.489
Do Kyung, are you there?

380
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.459
Gi Jae, I have a meeting now. I have to go.

381
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.170
What if that's what she's after?

382
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.840
You're a third-generation corporate heir?

383
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.200
Good for you.

384
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.509
I'll wait until you come,

385
00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.009
even if it's all night.

386
00:21:44.979 --> 00:21:48.450
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

387
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:49.509
Well...

388
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.019
I apologized to her and told her to call me.

389
00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:53.680
Why isn't she calling me though?

390
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.850
For goodness' sake.

391
00:22:01.229 --> 00:22:03.959
(Haesung Corporation)

392
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.769
They are Haesung Corporation's...

393
00:22:07.769 --> 00:22:09.999
vice-chairman and his wife.

394
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.440
(Name: Seo Ji An)

395
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.420
Your severance pay will be paid tomorrow.

396
00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:27.850
Okay, have a good day.

397
00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:35.289
You did such a horrible job,

398
00:22:35.289 --> 00:22:37.559
and that's why I'm so stressed out.

399
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.499
That's impossible.

400
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.229
I'll explain in person. Meet me at the cafe.

401
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.299
Don't you know how busy we get at month-ends?

402
00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:46.739
I can't leave the office, so just come meet me here.

403
00:22:56.809 --> 00:22:58.049
Hello, everyone!

404
00:23:01.219 --> 00:23:02.489
What brings you here, Ji An?

405
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.620
Oh, Ha Jung said...

406
00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:08.229
there are issues with what I used to work on.

407
00:23:08.229 --> 00:23:10.059
Oh, that.

408
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.370
Ji An, I thought you were meticulous.

409
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.569
What happened?

410
00:23:16.569 --> 00:23:18.299
Ha Jung has been very stressed out.

411
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.069
Oh, I'm sorry.

412
00:23:22.069 --> 00:23:23.910
I'll take a look and find out what the issue is.

413
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.680
Okay. Also, I've actually been meaning to call you.

414
00:23:27.979 --> 00:23:29.509
Let's meet up for a meal soon.

415
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:30.549
Sure.

416
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.620
What's the problem?

417
00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:41.059
You made this spreadsheet, right?

418
00:23:41.229 --> 00:23:42.229
Yes.

419
00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:44.700
What on earth did you do?

420
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.769
It's a complete mess.

421
00:23:47.769 --> 00:23:50.029
Because of you, our years' worth of data...

422
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:51.700
got all jumbled up.

423
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.170
What are you talking about?

424
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.110
When I put the numbers per brand in this column,

425
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.209
the yearly average should show in this cell.

426
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:00.610
But look at this.

427
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.450
I get a minus figure. Does this make sense to you?

428
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.690
Have you been using this file for two years?

429
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.729
Ha Jung.

430
00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:17.660
Take a good look, okay?

431
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.499
(Yearly Sales Goal Per Brand)

432
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.309
Oh, why is it like this?

433
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.670
What do you think?

434
00:24:29.739 --> 00:24:33.009
You misread my spreadsheet.

435
00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:36.779
I made my format horizontal, not vertical.

436
00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:40.319
All other spreadsheets use the vertical format.

437
00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:42.049
Those have to be submitted,

438
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:43.489
so I followed the Korean file format...

439
00:24:43.489 --> 00:24:44.590
to abide by the company standard.

440
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.120
Then you should've done the same with this one.

441
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.190
Why? I made that file for my personal use.

442
00:24:50.959 --> 00:24:52.630
- What? - I made it...

443
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.830
only for myself to make the work process easier.

444
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.700
I made it to speed up the calculation.

445
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.140
You still had to make it...

446
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.170
in a way that your successor can use it.

447
00:25:03.569 --> 00:25:06.340
If you need a different format,

448
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.809
make a new spreadsheet yourself.

449
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.219
Goodness.

450
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.450
Ha Jung, have you been taking all this time...

451
00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.519
because you don't even know how to use Excel?

452
00:25:17.519 --> 00:25:19.289
No, that's not what happened.

453
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.160
I guess I approached it too sensibly.

454
00:25:26.529 --> 00:25:27.630
What is it then?

455
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.130
It wasn't Ji An's fault.

456
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.569
My goodness.

457
00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:35.940
She always did a perfect job with no mistakes.

458
00:25:36.509 --> 00:25:37.809
I thought it was weird.

459
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.640
There's more.

460
00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:41.709
She even makes great coffee.

461
00:25:41.979 --> 00:25:44.850
Totally. Ji An, I miss your coffee.

462
00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:49.219
Can I ask you to make me coffee since you're here?

463
00:25:49.289 --> 00:25:50.319
Of course.

464
00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:11.209
Here you go, sir.

465
00:26:11.209 --> 00:26:13.180
- Oh, thank you. - Thanks a lot, Ji An.

466
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.779
- Here's your coffee. - Thank you.

467
00:26:14.779 --> 00:26:16.209
- Here's yours. - Thanks.

468
00:26:20.249 --> 00:26:22.420
Are you suddenly wondering what you're doing now?

469
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.729
Why are you only making five cups? Where's mine?

470
00:26:29.229 --> 00:26:30.799
Is being servile ingrained in you now?

471
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:32.900
You were let go. How can you say yes right away...

472
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.569
when being asked to make coffee?

473
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.499
Take this to them. You're the most junior one here.

474
00:26:41.469 --> 00:26:43.709
Give me the money before you throw a tantrum.

475
00:26:46.009 --> 00:26:48.150
And what did you want to talk about? Make it quick.

476
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:53.920
I'm supposed to give you 5,000 dollars for...

477
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.690
the settlement money and dental expenses, right?

478
00:26:58.890 --> 00:26:59.989
It's 1,000 dollars.

479
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.789
1,000 dollars?

480
00:27:02.759 --> 00:27:04.529
I'll pay you the rest in installments.

481
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.700
I have to pay back someone else first.

482
00:27:07.229 --> 00:27:09.799
You said you'd pay me with your severance pay.

483
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.739
I owe someone else money.

484
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.209
I was really out of it that day, you know.

485
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.110
That's why I forgot about it.

486
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.539
You were let go that day.

487
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.610
You couldn't have planned to spend it elsewhere.

488
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.120
Even if I had gotten the permanent position,

489
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.150
they would've paid me out for the contract position.

490
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:30.350
I dropped the charges for you.

491
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.019
I can't believe you'll pay me back in installments.

492
00:27:32.019 --> 00:27:35.029
You can sue me for breaking the agreement.

493
00:27:35.729 --> 00:27:36.759
What do you say?

494
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.330
Do you want to get 1,000 dollars every month,

495
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.959
or do you want to sue me?

496
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.209
This is mine, right?

497
00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:03.549
It's hot.

498
00:28:07.289 --> 00:28:09.190
My gosh, this is crazy.

499
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.130
Why? Is something wrong with it?

500
00:28:12.229 --> 00:28:13.400
Does it taste weird?

501
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:16.170
No, the word, "delicious", isn't enough for this,

502
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.999
but I can't think of any other words.

503
00:28:18.469 --> 00:28:21.440
Goodness, you scared me there for a second.

504
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.539
Organic wheat flour, milk, sun-dried salt,

505
00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:26.640
and unsalted butter. That much I can taste,

506
00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:31.180
but there's something sweet that's not sugar.

507
00:28:31.249 --> 00:28:32.850
I can't figure out what it is.

508
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:41.459
What is it? Please tell me.

509
00:28:41.459 --> 00:28:43.029
Go sweep the storefront.

510
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.259
Goodness, he didn't fall for it.

511
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.390
My gosh, the numbers keep going up every month.

512
00:29:10.719 --> 00:29:13.289
If I can make return on my investment soon,

513
00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:15.330
you'll become a CEO in no time.

514
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.170
Didn't your company put out...

515
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.200
- a recruitment call? - Yes.

516
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.739
Is the application deadline already over?

517
00:29:24.739 --> 00:29:27.509
No, it ends this week. Why do you ask?

518
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.840
I know someone who's very competent.

519
00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.519
(Hyuk)

520
00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:45.519
Hey, Hyuk.

521
00:29:53.059 --> 00:29:54.930
You said Mr. Sun rides a bike.

522
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.539
Yes.

523
00:29:58.499 --> 00:30:00.700
He always came from that direction.

524
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:13.420
Yes, he always came like that from that way.

525
00:30:37.979 --> 00:30:41.509
Gosh! Wait, Mr. Sun!

526
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.620
Mr. Sun!

527
00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:07.509
That's a relief.

528
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:11.080
Ji An was right.

529
00:31:11.739 --> 00:31:13.309
He works near here.

530
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.610
What a relief.

531
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.450
I'm so relieved.

532
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:18.979
If I want to buy this chair...

533
00:31:18.979 --> 00:31:21.519
for five dollars, will you sell it to me?

534
00:31:21.819 --> 00:31:22.850
Of course.

535
00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.890
A college senior who studied furniture made it.

536
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.860
It's one of a kind.

537
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:29.989
Then why would you sell it for five dollars?

538
00:31:30.229 --> 00:31:32.600
Because he made it hoping it'll be used by someone.

539
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.630
The delivery service is not included though.

540
00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:41.340
- All right. See you. - Thank you.

541
00:31:47.749 --> 00:31:49.779
Hee, you saw what I just did.

542
00:31:49.779 --> 00:31:50.850
Is it hard for you?

543
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.120
No.

544
00:31:52.719 --> 00:31:55.120
She just kept quibbling over every little detail.

545
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.489
I know. But it's not hard to say things I just said.

546
00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.989
I know.

547
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.430
It doesn't seem hard when you say that.

548
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.759
But why is it so hard for me?

549
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.870
Hee. We started this cafe...

550
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.640
because you said you could run a cafe.

551
00:32:13.969 --> 00:32:15.969
You can't call me like this over little things.

552
00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:19.809
I'm a businessman.

553
00:32:20.309 --> 00:32:23.749
I have a plan. I need to take a shower and change.

554
00:32:23.749 --> 00:32:25.249
But I used up all my time.

555
00:32:26.819 --> 00:32:28.120
I'm sorry.

556
00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:32.120
Why are you still afraid of people?

557
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.660
It's been a long time.

558
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:35.860
Well...

559
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.529
Can I do the kitchen work...

560
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.830
and hire someone to serve customers?

561
00:32:41.569 --> 00:32:42.729
There you go again.

562
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.499
You'll do this alone until the break-even point.

563
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:47.709
You said you could do it, right?

564
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:49.640
Yes, I did.

565
00:32:52.309 --> 00:32:53.880
Okay. I'll do this alone.

566
00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.549
You'll be late. You should go now.

567
00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.380
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:12.529 --> 00:33:14.400
You don't need to run under this heat.

569
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:16.370
I don't want you to wait.

570
00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.370
You're only five minutes late.

571
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.840
I told you to wait in a cafe. Why are you here?

572
00:33:23.009 --> 00:33:24.440
Because we should go somewhere.

573
00:33:24.979 --> 00:33:26.080
Where?

574
00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.049
Cheers!

575
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.549
I feel better now.

576
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.719
You could've drunk beer in a cafe.

577
00:33:38.719 --> 00:33:40.989
Why would I? I can drink four cans of beer...

578
00:33:40.989 --> 00:33:42.729
on an open-air terrace with only 10 dollars.

579
00:33:43.489 --> 00:33:44.959
You're so frugal, Ji An.

580
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.700
I know I'm stingy.

581
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.299
You've never lived as a job seeker, right?

582
00:33:50.469 --> 00:33:51.840
What do you know?

583
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.999
Your friend is a businessman. Use him.

584
00:33:53.999 --> 00:33:56.769
If I ask you for help, it won't be a one-off.

585
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:59.940
Once it becomes habitual, I won't survive on my own.

586
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:02.610
I owed you big time already.

587
00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:05.519
By the way,

588
00:34:06.219 --> 00:34:09.390
what made you want to drink beer so badly?

589
00:34:14.259 --> 00:34:15.330
Hyuk.

590
00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:18.730
Have you ever imagined...

591
00:34:19.299 --> 00:34:22.700
that your parents are not your biological parents?

592
00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:24.299
Why would I imagine that?

593
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.770
When your parents give you a good scare,

594
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.040
when you feel treated unfairly by your parents,

595
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:34.350
or when you hear the news about a missing child...

596
00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:35.680
There's more.

597
00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.450
A paternity test is very common these days.

598
00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.120
Couples get divorced after the paternity test.

599
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.219
Then the child will have a new father.

600
00:34:45.259 --> 00:34:46.689
Have you thought about that before?

601
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:51.500
People are so obsessed with blood relationship.

602
00:34:51.529 --> 00:34:52.799
I think that's ridiculous.

603
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.830
To become a real family, you must live with them.

604
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:58.669
Then what if...

605
00:34:59.569 --> 00:35:01.710
you were a son of super-rich parents?

606
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:03.640
What would you do then?

607
00:35:05.879 --> 00:35:08.279
A daytime drink makes you become hammered.

608
00:35:09.009 --> 00:35:11.779
You became so imaginative only after a can of beer.

609
00:35:12.779 --> 00:35:14.689
- Would you leave? - No, I wouldn't.

610
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:15.989
Why not?

611
00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:18.460
Let me put it this way.

612
00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:21.129
What if your birth parents are not rich?

613
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.029
What if they are much poorer than your parents?

614
00:35:24.399 --> 00:35:25.560
Would you still leave your parents?

615
00:35:26.799 --> 00:35:28.029
No, I wouldn't.

616
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.029
So you're leaving your parents for money.

617
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.370
If you choose someone for money,

618
00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:33.799
how could you call them your parents?

619
00:35:34.739 --> 00:35:36.140
- I can't do that. - I know.

620
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.310
Bingo.

621
00:35:37.379 --> 00:35:40.210
Let's make a toast for my family.

622
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:41.850
Cheers!

623
00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.239
Tae Soo.

624
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.609
Let's eat out tonight.

625
00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:12.080
I heard there's a famous restaurant in Daejeon.

626
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.210
Everyone wants to go there.

627
00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.750
I can get a free meal here.

628
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.710
Why would I waste my money for dinner?

629
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.549
Gosh, all you need to spend is just 20 dollars.

630
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.290
They are all the same once they are in my stomach.

631
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.989
They only stay in my mouth for 10 seconds.

632
00:36:25.989 --> 00:36:27.830
I won't eat beef for the sake of 10 seconds.

633
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.460
They are all the same once they are in my stomach.

634
00:36:31.759 --> 00:36:33.259
They only stay in my mouth for 10 seconds.

635
00:36:33.259 --> 00:36:35.799
I won't waste 20 dollars for the 10 seconds.

636
00:36:35.799 --> 00:36:37.770
Don't be like that, Tae Soo.

637
00:36:38.469 --> 00:36:39.899
Gosh.

638
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.210
No one will appreciate you...

639
00:36:42.469 --> 00:36:44.710
even if you try so hard to save money.

640
00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:46.210
My family,

641
00:36:46.439 --> 00:36:48.680
my kids will appreciate it.

642
00:36:53.149 --> 00:36:54.319
I've arrived.

643
00:37:00.489 --> 00:37:03.390
(Our fourth anniversary)

644
00:37:03.759 --> 00:37:06.629
I know you will just take me to a concert, Ji Tae.

645
00:37:08.629 --> 00:37:09.730
Ma'am.

646
00:37:13.569 --> 00:37:15.310
Yes. Ma'am, do you know...

647
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.040
where the B-boy theater is?

648
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.509
Hey, you don't need to call me ma'am.

649
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.009
- Oh, okay. - She's like my mom's age.

650
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:26.319
By the way, do you know...

651
00:37:26.319 --> 00:37:27.549
I don't know.

652
00:37:30.689 --> 00:37:32.460
You saw me when I called you ma'am.

653
00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.160
You're old enough to be called ma'am.

654
00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.390
- Hey, come here. - She's an old lady.

655
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.660
- What did you just say? - Ma'am.

656
00:37:36.689 --> 00:37:38.700
- Hey, come here! - An old lady!

657
00:37:38.859 --> 00:37:40.770
Gosh, what was that?

658
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.129
That's the problem with kids today.

659
00:37:43.129 --> 00:37:45.040
They're so rude.

660
00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:50.410
I'm sorry. I dozed off.

661
00:37:51.009 --> 00:37:53.210
Dozed off? Where?

662
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.649
At home.

663
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.509
Come over to my place. I don't feel like going out.

664
00:37:56.879 --> 00:37:58.649
Why would I go to your house?

665
00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.219
Don't you know what day it is today?

666
00:38:00.219 --> 00:38:03.549
(Don't you know what day it is today?)

667
00:38:03.549 --> 00:38:05.859
(Don't you know...)

668
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:12.100
Soo A, what's the occasion?

669
00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.529
Why are you dressed up like that?

670
00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:15.469
Where's he?

671
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.129
He's sleeping in his room.

672
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.710
I'll have soda with ice.

673
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:23.210
Okay.

674
00:38:23.969 --> 00:38:25.310
Hey, Seo Ji Tae!

675
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.480
You thought we were going to a concert, right?

676
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.279
That's why you're so dressed up.

677
00:38:32.149 --> 00:38:33.419
What are you talking about?

678
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.319
A comic book cafe on our fourth anniversary?

679
00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.890
All you have is this tiny little cake.

680
00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.529
I'm not so naive to think that...

681
00:38:47.569 --> 00:38:49.529
you'll take me to the concert.

682
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.169
Your perfume is all over the place.

683
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.739
Just sit up.

684
00:38:55.739 --> 00:38:57.480
That's not cool at all.

685
00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.379
Why not?

686
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.509
I have a surprise for you.

687
00:39:01.509 --> 00:39:03.680
This is a comic book cafe that we literally live in.

688
00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.680
How could you call this tiny cake a surprise?

689
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:10.919
You don't know what a surprise is.

690
00:39:12.489 --> 00:39:14.560
And why is it so ugly?

691
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.600
Even though it looks ugly, it tastes good.

692
00:39:17.899 --> 00:39:20.430
It has a lot of cheese, butter, and fresh cream...

693
00:39:20.629 --> 00:39:22.129
just the way you like it.

694
00:39:24.169 --> 00:39:25.540
Did you make it yourself?

695
00:39:27.569 --> 00:39:29.370
I took the afternoon off.

696
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.379
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

697
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.210
Don't be moved.

698
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:39.080
You feel moved and touched so easily.

699
00:39:39.919 --> 00:39:41.049
That's boring.

700
00:39:42.649 --> 00:39:43.790
I'm fed up with that.

701
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:46.319
What's that?

702
00:39:48.129 --> 00:39:49.489
Is it a cosmetic cooler?

703
00:39:49.489 --> 00:39:53.259
Your roommate uses your cosmetics in the fridge.

704
00:39:53.399 --> 00:39:55.029
Did I tell you about that?

705
00:39:55.169 --> 00:39:56.799
- When? - I don't know.

706
00:39:56.799 --> 00:39:59.200
I don't remember when, where, or how I heard it,

707
00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.109
but I'm fed up with the story.

708
00:40:02.169 --> 00:40:04.080
Gosh, come here.

709
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.779
Ji Tae.

710
00:40:07.239 --> 00:40:08.480
You thought I'd be like this, right?

711
00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:10.379
Yes!

712
00:40:11.279 --> 00:40:12.580
Oh my gosh.

713
00:40:13.279 --> 00:40:14.620
This is so cute.

714
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.489
Don't act like a middle-aged lady.

715
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.419
Ji Tae.

716
00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:21.359
Do I look old?

717
00:40:21.629 --> 00:40:24.560
Some teenagers called me ma'am earlier today.

718
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:29.500
You're a middle-aged lady to teenagers.

719
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:30.770
You're 33 years old now.

720
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:33.239
Gosh, I'm serious.

721
00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:36.370
Do you really think I look old?

722
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.080
Why would you ask me that?

723
00:40:41.509 --> 00:40:42.680
You don't need to.

724
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:45.620
If I look old even to you,

725
00:40:45.649 --> 00:40:47.279
you won't marry me.

726
00:40:49.419 --> 00:40:50.790
I know.

727
00:40:52.189 --> 00:40:55.730
You should've gotten married four years ago.

728
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.700
Seriously! Are you saying I'm old?

729
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.330
Are you tired of the single life?

730
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.469
Tell me when you want to get married.

731
00:41:01.469 --> 00:41:04.339
- I'll let you go. - Don't be so gracious.

732
00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:06.540
I'll get married even if you don't let me.

733
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.640
Whenever I want.

734
00:41:08.339 --> 00:41:09.339
Me too.

735
00:41:12.879 --> 00:41:14.609
Why did you make a cake?

736
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.009
We agreed not to celebrate anniversaries.

737
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.020
I shouldn't have baked it, right?

738
00:41:19.149 --> 00:41:21.149
I thought that as I was making it.

739
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.450
Don't celebrate an anniversary...

740
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:23.649
with no future.

741
00:41:23.819 --> 00:41:25.259
That's our motto.

742
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.489
I knew you'd tell me off.

743
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.960
And you still made a cake?

744
00:41:29.989 --> 00:41:31.899
When we first started dating,

745
00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:37.330
we both believed we wouldn't last three years.

746
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.370
And now,

747
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.509
four years have passed.

748
00:41:42.669 --> 00:41:45.410
It felt strange, so I made a cake.

749
00:41:46.279 --> 00:41:48.410
Just for fun.

750
00:41:50.509 --> 00:41:51.549
Here.

751
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.350
Let's blow it out.

752
00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.859
Soo A, why'd you blow it out on your own?

753
00:41:59.859 --> 00:42:01.460
Let's not last another year.

754
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.299
It we put it out together, it becomes a celebration.

755
00:42:04.899 --> 00:42:06.230
That's not like us.

756
00:42:37.799 --> 00:42:39.029
(Wife)

757
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.069
Hello, honey.

758
00:42:46.339 --> 00:42:49.239
Hi, it's me. How are things at home?

759
00:42:50.339 --> 00:42:51.379
We're fine.

760
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.180
How is Ji An?

761
00:42:53.239 --> 00:42:54.980
She isn't home yet.

762
00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:58.149
Is everything all right with Ji An?

763
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:02.120
Why do you always ask what our kids...

764
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.219
have been up to whenever you call?

765
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.189
Don't you know?

766
00:43:06.189 --> 00:43:08.790
They struggle to get through each day.

767
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:11.759
What's the point in asking how their day's been?

768
00:43:11.859 --> 00:43:14.770
What can you do if they are not well?

769
00:43:15.399 --> 00:43:18.469
Why do you sound so upset?

770
00:43:18.739 --> 00:43:20.299
Has something happened?

771
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.009
It's because I feel sorry for you.

772
00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.739
Our kids grew up and lead their own lives now,

773
00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:30.080
and you're the only one who doesn't seem to know.

774
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.950
You're the only one who really cares for me.

775
00:43:37.419 --> 00:43:40.219
I need to go. The soup's boiling over.

776
00:44:03.649 --> 00:44:05.379
Get your ID cards ready.

777
00:44:07.989 --> 00:44:08.989
Get changed quickly.

778
00:44:08.989 --> 00:44:10.549
A huge group came in.

779
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:14.160
That means we won't get many tips today.

780
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:16.129
My pay will be it.

781
00:44:16.129 --> 00:44:18.700
Are you starting to care more about the tips?

782
00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.830
I'm Seo Ji Ho, and I'm mad for money.

783
00:44:22.129 --> 00:44:23.529
- Got that? - Get ready then.

784
00:44:23.529 --> 00:44:27.439
You can serve the rich-looking ones.

785
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:31.980
(0.1 million)

786
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.910
0.1 million. Let's get it.

787
00:44:40.049 --> 00:44:41.319
Come on in.

788
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:44.520
This table's just for you.

789
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.089
I'm 0.1 million.

790
00:44:48.029 --> 00:44:50.230
Here are your drinks.

791
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.430
Just because you're handsome.

792
00:44:53.029 --> 00:44:56.069
Thank you. Thank you.

793
00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.250
Who's that? A celebrity?

794
00:45:12.279 --> 00:45:14.290
Her? That's Cinderella.

795
00:45:14.719 --> 00:45:15.890
Cinderella?

796
00:45:16.049 --> 00:45:18.620
She disappears when it turns midnight.

797
00:45:18.719 --> 00:45:20.219
She's quite famous.

798
00:45:20.259 --> 00:45:22.529
Does she come here alone to dance?

799
00:45:22.529 --> 00:45:25.330
Once or twice a month. No hooking up with men.

800
00:45:25.899 --> 00:45:28.169
She's utterly mysterious.

801
00:45:28.169 --> 00:45:29.899
Utterly mysterious?

802
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.169
She won't give any tips then.

803
00:46:09.739 --> 00:46:11.739
Did you call to say I'm still practicing?

804
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:14.109
- Yes. - Did she buy it?

805
00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.410
- Yes. - Are you sure?

806
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.080
Yes.

807
00:46:19.049 --> 00:46:21.290
Is that all you have to say to me?

808
00:46:22.989 --> 00:46:23.989
Yes.

809
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.089
Why?

810
00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.859
I'll start the car.

811
00:46:41.609 --> 00:46:42.710
Mom.

812
00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.080
- I practiced until... - Go to your room.

813
00:47:14.509 --> 00:47:16.339
(Premium Good Exhibition)

814
00:47:16.339 --> 00:47:17.680
Goodbye.

815
00:47:18.779 --> 00:47:20.109
Welcome.

816
00:47:21.009 --> 00:47:23.109
Where's Ferragamo?

817
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:25.649
Right over here, ma'am.

818
00:47:26.279 --> 00:47:28.390
Over there. Thank you.

819
00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.919
(Victim)

820
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.759
What is wrong with this guy?

821
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.230
(Silent mode)

822
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:41.730
Welcome.

823
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.669
The recipient rejected the call.

824
00:47:44.669 --> 00:47:46.839
I thought the expression, "hopping mad",

825
00:47:46.839 --> 00:47:49.469
was an expression used by vulgar people.

826
00:47:49.469 --> 00:47:51.540
But this was exactly what they meant.

827
00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.180
At times like this.

828
00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.279
Oh, sorry.

829
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.790
Secretary Yoo.

830
00:48:01.649 --> 00:48:03.390
Must you do this now too?

831
00:48:03.649 --> 00:48:05.819
- What? - Look.

832
00:48:06.089 --> 00:48:08.390
Why are our lunches different?

833
00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.129
How many times...

834
00:48:10.129 --> 00:48:12.000
must I tell you to get the same thing?

835
00:48:12.399 --> 00:48:14.029
When you eat with me,

836
00:48:14.029 --> 00:48:15.730
we are equals, no discrimination.

837
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.600
Did I ever make you eat something else...

838
00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.040
when we ate together?

839
00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.140
No, sir.

840
00:48:20.239 --> 00:48:23.109
Then why are you discriminating yourself?

841
00:48:23.839 --> 00:48:24.910
I apologize.

842
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.279
I had some rice cakes that Mr. Song handed around.

843
00:48:28.279 --> 00:48:30.879
I wasn't that hungry, so I got a smaller lunchbox.

844
00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.520
- Is that it? - Yes.

845
00:48:34.989 --> 00:48:36.520
- Is that all? - Yes.

846
00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.359
So that's it.

847
00:48:39.989 --> 00:48:41.029
Eat up.

848
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.500
I feel almost dizzy.

849
00:48:47.029 --> 00:48:50.069
I think she doesn't want your money.

850
00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:51.899
That's exactly it.

851
00:48:51.939 --> 00:48:54.739
Why is she ignoring my calls and texts?

852
00:48:55.739 --> 00:48:57.310
Is she up to something?

853
00:48:58.109 --> 00:49:00.779
She must've found out who I am at the event.

854
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.609
- Did she call the press? - No.

855
00:49:03.609 --> 00:49:06.020
Without even knowing what I want to do for her?

856
00:49:06.049 --> 00:49:09.049
I was going to absolve all her debt.

857
00:49:10.149 --> 00:49:13.160
I just don't know what to do with her.

858
00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:18.330
You should eat first, and think about it later.

859
00:49:25.239 --> 00:49:26.299
(Calling)

860
00:49:26.299 --> 00:49:28.109
(Assailant)

861
00:49:30.669 --> 00:49:31.939
I'll do both.

862
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.540
Okay.

863
00:49:35.049 --> 00:49:38.549
Let's see who wins.

864
00:49:52.029 --> 00:49:54.669
Everything's in your trunk. Goodbye.

865
00:50:03.739 --> 00:50:04.839
(Victim)

866
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:09.049
(Victim)

867
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.879
(57 missed calls)

868
00:50:20.859 --> 00:50:22.629
She texted back.

869
00:50:23.859 --> 00:50:25.430
Why do you keep calling?

870
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.399
I told you to send your account details.

871
00:50:29.299 --> 00:50:31.939
I can't give out personal information to anyone.

872
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.739
Let's do this in person.

873
00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:37.540
Forget it. Send your bank details.

874
00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.879
If you contact me again, I will make you pay.

875
00:50:39.939 --> 00:50:41.850
I'll sue you for stalking.

876
00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.279
She'll sue me?

877
00:50:45.319 --> 00:50:46.649
Hey. Secretary Yoo.

878
00:50:47.819 --> 00:50:51.219
Ask Lawyer Jung if calling someone too often...

879
00:50:51.219 --> 00:50:53.859
can be sued for stalking.

880
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.040
Oh dear.

881
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:06.569
Here's your shopping.

882
00:51:06.899 --> 00:51:09.270
My daughter parked the car.

883
00:51:09.569 --> 00:51:11.210
Load it up, and wait.

884
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:12.910
I'll drop by the ladies' room.

885
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.450
Yes, ma'am.

886
00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:22.219
- Ji Ho, Ji Ho. - Yes?

887
00:51:22.219 --> 00:51:25.259
Get 10 pairs each of 2025, 1017, and 1003.

888
00:51:25.419 --> 00:51:26.890
- 10 each? - Yes.

889
00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:29.689
- Okay, I won't be long. - Right. Make it quick.

890
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:56.719
Would you mind moving your car, ma'am?

891
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:58.689
My daughter won't be long.

892
00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.359
I need to put these in someone's car.

893
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:05.160
And you aren't allowed to park here.

894
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.160
I can't drive.

895
00:52:07.629 --> 00:52:09.569
Walk around the car, lady.

896
00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:11.700
Okay, ma'am.

897
00:52:24.009 --> 00:52:26.950
What a nitwit.

898
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:27.989
Hey.

899
00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:29.689
Stop right there.

900
00:52:33.489 --> 00:52:34.790
What did you just say?

901
00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:37.799
"Nitwit"? Is that what you said?

902
00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:41.430
No, I wasn't talking about you.

903
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:43.330
I know you were.

904
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:45.169
I heard it very clearly.

905
00:52:45.899 --> 00:52:47.509
That's not it.

906
00:52:47.969 --> 00:52:51.879
This stalker guy has been calling me nonstop.

907
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:53.980
I was mumbling about him.

908
00:52:54.149 --> 00:52:57.009
I was talking about him when I said nitwit.

909
00:52:57.009 --> 00:52:58.419
Then let's see your phone.

910
00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:12.930
"When will you be home? Let's talk. Mom."

911
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:16.430
You're ill-mannered, and you lie too.

912
00:53:16.799 --> 00:53:19.469
You didn't even bat an eyelid when you lied.

913
00:53:19.469 --> 00:53:21.310
I didn't know it was my mom.

914
00:53:21.509 --> 00:53:23.310
I really wasn't talking about you.

915
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.210
How dare you mock me?

916
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:28.180
Do you know who I am?

917
00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.950
What is the matter, ma'am?

918
00:53:30.009 --> 00:53:31.450
What's wrong, Mom?

919
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.149
She called me a nitwit because my car...

920
00:53:34.149 --> 00:53:35.549
was in her way.

921
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:36.819
She said, "What a nitwit."

922
00:53:36.819 --> 00:53:39.189
Then she says that she wasn't talking to me.

923
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:41.430
Hey.

924
00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:44.430
What's going on?

925
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.169
Get on your knees.

926
00:53:54.669 --> 00:53:55.939
I apologize.

927
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:59.310
You keep saying sorry, but you don't mean it.

928
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.180
We spent 10,000 dollars here today.

929
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:04.480
I apologize, ma'am.

930
00:54:05.919 --> 00:54:07.250
Get on your knees.

931
00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.879
Is that it?

932
00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.850
Have you forgotten why you're kneeling?

933
00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:39.850
I'm sorry.

934
00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.390
It depends on who's in the wrong.

935
00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:46.160
Isn't that too much?

936
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.560
Why did they make her kneel?

937
00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:51.500
- Isn't that harsh? - That's too much.

938
00:54:54.669 --> 00:54:57.169
- Whose fault is it? - That's horrid.

939
00:54:59.169 --> 00:55:00.569
Let's go.

940
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:02.739
That's too harsh.

941
00:55:19.319 --> 00:55:21.589
I heard what happened in the parking lot.

942
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.129
You're fired.

943
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:33.669
How could you fire me like that?

944
00:55:34.739 --> 00:55:36.839
I apologized on my knees.

945
00:55:36.839 --> 00:55:38.980
It was the VIP's demand. If I don't fire you,

946
00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:41.250
I'll lose my job.

947
00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:45.919
You should've knelt when she first told you to.

948
00:55:46.419 --> 00:55:48.049
Why make her so angry...

949
00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:50.819
if you were going to kneel anyway?

950
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.330
You'd done this kind of work many times before.

951
00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:58.000
What a mess.

952
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:55.250
My address?

953
00:56:55.719 --> 00:56:58.219
Why do you want my address?

954
00:56:58.419 --> 00:57:01.960
To talk things over with your sister in person.

955
00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:03.930
Really?

956
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:33.790
My back hurts.

957
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.259
Are you avoiding me as soon as you see me?

958
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.500
I won't bite, so relax.

959
00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:46.640
- Why are you here? - To see you.

960
00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.069
I wanted to, but you refused.

961
00:57:51.279 --> 00:57:53.910
How do you know I live here?

962
00:57:55.009 --> 00:57:57.919
I have a way of finding things out.

963
00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.589
Why are you doing this to me?

964
00:58:02.219 --> 00:58:04.160
Why?

965
00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:08.230
If you don't want to give me your bank details,

966
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:10.230
give me your secretary's.

967
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:12.060
Will you calm down?

968
00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.629
How can I calm down?

969
00:58:15.529 --> 00:58:18.239
Tell me how you tracked me down.

970
00:58:18.969 --> 00:58:20.399
Before I call the police.

971
00:58:21.739 --> 00:58:25.279
I can't tell you because I promised my source.

972
00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:28.410
Well, I'm here to apologize.

973
00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.750
To apologize and explain.

974
00:58:31.279 --> 00:58:33.850
Explain what? Apologize for what?

975
00:58:34.089 --> 00:58:37.089
I apologize for not paying you in Yangpyeong...

976
00:58:37.219 --> 00:58:40.060
and for not taking your calls.

977
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:42.230
That was wrong of me.

978
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:44.560
Something urgent came up.

979
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.870
I was flustered and left my phone...

980
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:49.629
All right. How much do I owe you?

981
00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.100
Hey.

982
00:58:51.239 --> 00:58:53.299
I took the time to come here...

983
00:58:53.299 --> 00:58:54.969
to apologize and explain...

984
00:58:54.969 --> 00:58:57.509
I get that, so how much do I owe you?

985
00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.180
How much was my pay?

986
00:59:00.379 --> 00:59:01.779
Tell me that, and leave.

987
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:03.850
I'll subtract that from the 5,000...

988
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:05.750
and wire the rest to your secretary.

989
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.589
Is that how you accept an apology?

990
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:09.450
Because I don't want your apology.

991
00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:11.589
Why don't you want my apology?

992
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:13.560
You forced me to take a taxi to Yangpyeong...

993
00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.730
and made me wait when I couldn't get a taxi back.

994
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.730
You ignored all my desperate calls.

995
00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:19.960
I'm trying to explain what happened.

996
00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:23.200
Must I listen if you want to explain,

997
00:59:23.469 --> 00:59:25.969
accept the fact that you don't like seeing me,

998
00:59:26.239 --> 00:59:28.140
be ignored if you have urgent business,

999
00:59:28.739 --> 00:59:30.669
and walk for two hours in the rain?

1000
00:59:31.009 --> 00:59:33.580
- Is that what I am? - Yes, that.

1001
00:59:33.779 --> 00:59:35.549
Why walk for hours if you don't have cash?

1002
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:37.919
- Use your credit card. - I have no credit card.

1003
00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.950
You act so righteous for someone who didn't keep...

1004
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:42.049
the three-day deadline.

1005
00:59:42.049 --> 00:59:43.489
Because I did my best.

1006
00:59:43.489 --> 00:59:46.290
It's not for you to decide whether you did your best.

1007
00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.029
I let you off.

1008
00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:50.759
You have an enormous ego.

1009
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.000
Pay me in full, then.

1010
00:59:53.859 --> 00:59:54.870
What?

1011
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:57.500
How dare you act like you owe me only 5,000 dollars?

1012
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:59.399
You owe me 20,700 dollars,

1013
00:59:59.399 --> 01:00:02.109
and I gave you 15,700 dollars off.

1014
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:04.939
In cash?

1015
01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.750
It'll cost 20,000 to 30,000 dollars.

1016
01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:13.450
Did it amount to 20,700 dollars?

1017
01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:15.549
You pleaded saying 5,000 was all you had.

1018
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:17.290
Was that really you?

1019
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:20.219
I was told not to show pity because...

1020
01:00:20.219 --> 01:00:21.629
people take favors for granted.

1021
01:00:21.629 --> 01:00:22.960
I forgot.

1022
01:00:23.529 --> 01:00:25.200
You were polite when I said you owed me 20,000.

1023
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:28.899
But now that it's 5,000, you're so haughty.

1024
01:00:31.339 --> 01:00:32.870
I take it all back.

1025
01:00:33.299 --> 01:00:34.810
I want the 20,000 dollars.

1026
01:00:37.339 --> 01:00:39.839
If you're going to be arrogant, pay first.

1027
01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:41.080
Isn't that fair?

1028
01:00:44.149 --> 01:00:45.520
Isn't it?

1029
01:00:56.359 --> 01:00:57.700
There's no need to shiver.

1030
01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.100
I won't take that money.

1031
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:03.799
I told you to wait that day...

1032
01:01:03.799 --> 01:01:05.500
to say your day's work...

1033
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.509
- was worth your debt. - Are you kidding me?

1034
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:11.839
You could've texted me to say that was your plan.

1035
01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:14.080
You're really helpless.

1036
01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.680
- Are you a beggar? - What?

1037
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.649
Do you think rich people are frivolous?

1038
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.989
No one spends money without a reason or cause.

1039
01:01:23.189 --> 01:01:25.089
Should we do this over the phone...

1040
01:01:25.189 --> 01:01:27.319
without so much as a decent thank you?

1041
01:01:29.529 --> 01:01:30.689
I apologize.

1042
01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:32.200
Your humble self is back,

1043
01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.399
now that the debt is back down to 5,000.

1044
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:36.100
I'll pay 5,000 back.

1045
01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.640
No. Don't you dare.

1046
01:01:38.739 --> 01:01:40.469
I don't want to see you when you ruin my mood...

1047
01:01:40.469 --> 01:01:41.939
more and more each time.

1048
01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.879
I will give you the 5,000.

1049
01:01:44.879 --> 01:01:46.339
Stop putting on a show...

1050
01:01:46.339 --> 01:01:48.109
if you won't pay the full 20,700 dollars.

1051
01:01:52.219 --> 01:01:53.219
Wait.

1052
01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.919
Wait. Wait.

1053
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:57.460
Wait.

1054
01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.850
You're really helpless.

1055
01:02:27.219 --> 01:02:28.620
Are you a beggar?

1056
01:02:30.319 --> 01:02:31.859
Is being servile ingrained in you now?

1057
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.989
You were let go. How can you say yes right away...

1058
01:02:33.989 --> 01:02:35.589
when being asked to make coffee?

1059
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.330
Why make her so angry...

1060
01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.100
if you were going to kneel anyway?

1061
01:03:05.759 --> 01:03:08.489
But Mom said I should study to not be like you.

1062
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:12.830
What if your bosses tell you to wipe their bottoms?

1063
01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.430
Would you do it?

1064
01:03:15.469 --> 01:03:18.339
Do you want to ask me to return your position now?

1065
01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.770
Stop putting on a show...

1066
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.379
if you won't pay the full 20,700 dollars.

1067
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.989
It's so late.

1068
01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:15.629
(Eun Seok)

1069
01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.700
Hello?

1070
01:04:23.969 --> 01:04:25.000
This is...

1071
01:04:26.299 --> 01:04:27.969
Seo Ji An.

1072
01:04:30.609 --> 01:04:31.710
Eun Seok?

1073
01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:37.210
I called to ask for a favor.

1074
01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:41.689
Tell me whatever it is you want.

1075
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:44.560
Could you...

1076
01:04:45.719 --> 01:04:48.129
lend me 20,000 dollars?

1077
01:05:03.509 --> 01:05:06.180
Ji Soo, Ji Ho, breakfast is ready.

1078
01:05:10.919 --> 01:05:13.950
Why is the table unusually full these days?

1079
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:24.160
Let's eat.

1080
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.430
Mom, are you spending all we have?

1081
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:28.299
Why do we have meat for every breakfast?

1082
01:05:30.569 --> 01:05:31.770
Eat up.

1083
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.439
Why are you so nice to her?

1084
01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:39.439
He seems suspicious, right?

1085
01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:41.810
I feel sorry.

1086
01:05:43.049 --> 01:05:45.379
You should feel grateful, not sorry.

1087
01:05:46.879 --> 01:05:48.549
I feel sorry for you too.

1088
01:05:49.189 --> 01:05:50.620
And for Ji Soo.

1089
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.259
And you too, Mom.

1090
01:06:06.299 --> 01:06:09.210
I'll move in with that family.

1091
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.640
With what family?

1092
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.379
What are you talking about?

1093
01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.890
I'll go to my real parents.

1094
01:06:28.914 --> 01:06:33.914
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1095
01:06:55.989 --> 01:06:58.460
(My Golden Life)

1096
01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:00.660
Is she really not my sister?

1097
01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:02.759
How are we not twins?

1098
01:07:03.629 --> 01:07:05.330
Are we Romeo and Juliet?

1099
01:07:05.399 --> 01:07:07.000
We never get a full day together.

1100
01:07:07.629 --> 01:07:10.399
I'm the person who owes you 20,700 dollars.

1101
01:07:10.399 --> 01:07:11.500
I'll hang up...

1102
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.540
and block you.

1103
01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:13.839
Aren't you a member of N-Gaon?

1104
01:07:13.839 --> 01:07:15.310
Are you blackmailing me?

1105
01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:17.839
How do you want the 20,700 dollars?

1106
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:21.049
I did something terrible.

1107
01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:22.049
What... What did you say?

1108
01:07:22.049 --> 01:07:24.819
Ji An said she'd go!

1109
01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.680
She didn't know.

1110
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:29.450
- She's coming? - Eun Seok's coming back?
