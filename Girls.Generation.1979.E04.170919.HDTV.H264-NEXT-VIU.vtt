1
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:12.522
Are you all right now?

2
00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:19.562
You must be hungry.

3
00:00:21.762 --> 00:00:22.861
Do you want some bread?

4
00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:36.512
Tteokbokki.

5
00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:41.822
I want to eat tteokbokki.

6
00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.122
Okay.

7
00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:46.192
Let's go.

8
00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:48.862
Enjoy.

9
00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:49.862
Thank you.

10
00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:56.362
Help yourself.

11
00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:58.432
- You should eat too. - What?

12
00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:01.101
Gosh.

13
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:03.271
Don't eat it like that. Here.

14
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:06.212
Gosh. What a good eater.

15
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.281
Okay.

16
00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:13.581
What is it?

17
00:01:14.182 --> 00:01:16.352
Does it hurt too much to eat?

18
00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:18.052
Well...

19
00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:20.591
No, it's not that.

20
00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:27.432
- What is it? - How can I eat...

21
00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:29.932
in front of you when you can't eat from the injury?

22
00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:32.132
Let's get it packed.

23
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:39.042
Let's just eat.

24
00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:40.542
It doesn't hurt at all.

25
00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:51.152
Happy?

26
00:01:51.652 --> 00:01:52.691
Eat up.

27
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:56.762
How strange.

28
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:59.932
I thought the world was crumbling...

29
00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:01.831
just a minute ago because of Jin.

30
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:04.331
But for some reason, I can eat well.

31
00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:10.672
Is it good?

32
00:02:11.612 --> 00:02:12.612
Yes.

33
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.821
This is good enough. You should go now.

34
00:02:26.452 --> 00:02:28.462
I'll walk you a little more.

35
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:34.061
Does it hurt?

36
00:02:34.862 --> 00:02:36.131
Why are you clenching to your side?

37
00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:38.372
- What? - Did you hurt your ribs?

38
00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:45.772
No, I'm completely fine.

39
00:02:46.272 --> 00:02:47.381
Is that so?

40
00:02:55.022 --> 00:02:56.281
(Episode 4)

41
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:57.351
Hello.

42
00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:58.952
Hey.

43
00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:01.022
Right, Jung Hee.

44
00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:03.191
How's your mom's burn on her hand?

45
00:03:03.232 --> 00:03:05.061
What? My mom?

46
00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:06.492
Don't you know?

47
00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:10.001
Your dad came yesterday and bought bandages.

48
00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.531
He did?

49
00:03:12.232 --> 00:03:14.841
Didn't you know your mom was hurt?

50
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:19.841
There's no way Dad would have...

51
00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:30.122
Jung Hee, where have you been?

52
00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:31.851
I went for a walk.

53
00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:32.992
Did something happen?

54
00:03:33.152 --> 00:03:34.561
No.

55
00:03:35.362 --> 00:03:37.892
Where have you been all night?

56
00:03:37.892 --> 00:03:39.332
Why are you coming home so late?

57
00:03:39.332 --> 00:03:40.802
She was just in front of the house.

58
00:03:42.561 --> 00:03:43.772
Mom, did you burn your hand?

59
00:03:43.772 --> 00:03:45.302
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:48.041
Did you fall asleep outside?

61
00:03:48.372 --> 00:03:50.011
It's your aunt who got a burn...

62
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:52.341
after your dad flipped the table.

63
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:55.411
Then why did Dad...

64
00:03:55.582 --> 00:03:58.011
You should go inside and sleep.

65
00:03:58.011 --> 00:04:01.351
I can't seem to stay awake after I have dinner.

66
00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:02.851
I'm going to bed.

67
00:04:03.552 --> 00:04:06.052
Did your dad go out to drink again?

68
00:04:06.052 --> 00:04:07.721
Why isn't he home yet?

69
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:09.932
Ma'am, here you go.

70
00:04:10.892 --> 00:04:12.631
The darn bedpan.

71
00:04:16.232 --> 00:04:17.602
Goodnight.

72
00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:41.391
I went to the book store.

73
00:04:44.432 --> 00:04:45.631
Who is Hae Joo?

74
00:04:50.472 --> 00:04:51.771
Did you go into my room again?

75
00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:54.102
Did your marks drop because of her?

76
00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:55.742
If you don't make it into Seoul National University,

77
00:04:55.742 --> 00:04:57.311
you'll bring shame to your father.

78
00:04:57.641 --> 00:04:59.441
- You know that, right? - I do.

79
00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:06.412
Are you home?

80
00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:08.381
Don't stay out so late.

81
00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:10.651
Things seem to be unstable these days.

82
00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:13.722
- Okay. - A communist...

83
00:05:14.422 --> 00:05:16.162
somehow got into our mine.

84
00:05:17.032 --> 00:05:18.162
A communist?

85
00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:20.561
I hear he was a professor in Seoul.

86
00:05:24.872 --> 00:05:26.372
What a headache.

87
00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:39.182
Do you think Eng Cho is a beggar?

88
00:05:40.552 --> 00:05:42.552
Did I ask you to do that?

89
00:06:29.802 --> 00:06:31.872
- Hae Joo. - Dad.

90
00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:34.071
Are you home?

91
00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:35.901
Is Kyung Soo doing well?

92
00:06:39.811 --> 00:06:40.842
Let's go in.

93
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:10.771
Hey, Lee Jung Hee.

94
00:07:11.612 --> 00:07:13.342
It's not a crime to have a crush.

95
00:07:17.412 --> 00:07:20.422
Be proud. Have confidence.

96
00:07:29.422 --> 00:07:31.261
- Jung Hee! - Hey.

97
00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:34.701
Hey, guys.

98
00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:38.001
What is this? Are you a Miss Korea?

99
00:07:38.532 --> 00:07:40.802
I heard you went to Gyeryoon High School.

100
00:07:41.102 --> 00:07:43.542
My brother told me he saw you.

101
00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:45.071
What?

102
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:47.612
Did you go there to see Jin?

103
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:49.742
Don't you have any pride?

104
00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:51.581
Of course I do.

105
00:07:51.852 --> 00:07:54.352
I went yesterday to check on something.

106
00:07:54.922 --> 00:07:57.391
I'm over Jin now.

107
00:07:58.151 --> 00:07:59.651
- Are you serious? - Yes.

108
00:07:59.821 --> 00:08:03.232
I'll be going my way now. Out of my way.

109
00:08:03.362 --> 00:08:04.391
Jung Hee.

110
00:08:08.732 --> 00:08:09.862
Hi, girls.

111
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:13.842
Hello, Hae Joo.

112
00:08:16.501 --> 00:08:19.771
Can we talk?

113
00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:21.542
Sure.

114
00:08:22.441 --> 00:08:24.251
Why didn't you tell me?

115
00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:29.222
I saw everything yesterday.

116
00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:32.722
I saw Jin waiting at your front door.

117
00:08:33.122 --> 00:08:34.222
I didn't think...

118
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:37.592
it was necessary to tell you.

119
00:08:37.992 --> 00:08:40.631
There's nothing between Jin and I.

120
00:08:41.102 --> 00:08:43.431
I didn't want things to get awkward between us.

121
00:08:43.832 --> 00:08:45.031
I was scared.

122
00:08:45.202 --> 00:08:47.001
Didn't I tell you?

123
00:08:48.242 --> 00:08:50.242
Doing that wouldn't be looking out for me.

124
00:08:50.742 --> 00:08:52.212
I was made a fool.

125
00:08:52.242 --> 00:08:54.541
No, Jung Hee. That's not true.

126
00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:55.781
That's...

127
00:08:57.881 --> 00:08:59.212
what you think.

128
00:09:00.051 --> 00:09:02.622
Anyway, I didn't...

129
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:04.622
feel so great.

130
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:05.952
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:07.462 --> 00:09:09.462
It was wrong of me to think that way.

132
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:11.492
I'm sorry, Jung Hee.

133
00:09:15.131 --> 00:09:17.771
I'm completely over...

134
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:19.531
Jin now.

135
00:09:20.301 --> 00:09:22.641
I don't have any feelings...

136
00:09:22.972 --> 00:09:24.372
towards Jin...

137
00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:29.281
anymore.

138
00:09:31.582 --> 00:09:34.781
You won't have to worry about my feelings anymore.

139
00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:37.952
That's it.

140
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:42.261
Good job, Jung Hee.

141
00:09:42.562 --> 00:09:45.631
You were so brave. You have your pride back.

142
00:10:05.582 --> 00:10:07.322
What are you doing, Dong Moon?

143
00:10:07.322 --> 00:10:09.122
You'll digest all of your lunch.

144
00:10:09.822 --> 00:10:11.921
What's with you? Stop that!

145
00:10:13.151 --> 00:10:14.992
What's wrong with you? Stop!

146
00:10:26.271 --> 00:10:29.401
- What move is this? - This?

147
00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:31.742
It's a cream move.

148
00:10:31.742 --> 00:10:34.641
Then this is the streusel move.

149
00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:41.222
Wait, wait.

150
00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:45.352
Salute!

151
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.592
Salute.

152
00:10:58.431 --> 00:11:01.041
Why would you salute a hypocrite?

153
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:03.671
Don't do that. You dropped my bread!

154
00:11:03.942 --> 00:11:06.171
- He's my brother-in-law. - What?

155
00:11:06.842 --> 00:11:08.011
What a joke.

156
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:11.852
Y equals ax squared plus bx plus c.

157
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:14.122
Now, after this...

158
00:11:14.122 --> 00:11:15.181
What's wrong with her?

159
00:11:15.352 --> 00:11:16.452
At minus one,

160
00:11:16.452 --> 00:11:19.791
the straight line is approaching x...

161
00:11:19.822 --> 00:11:23.562
I'll clench my teeth and study my hardest.

162
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:26.801
I'll beat Hae Joo.

163
00:11:42.141 --> 00:11:44.011
Hae Joo and Gwi Ja can go sit down.

164
00:11:45.281 --> 00:11:48.181
Do I still have a long way to catch up?

165
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:50.421
The rest of you, to your positions.

166
00:11:51.722 --> 00:11:52.852
Come on, sir.

167
00:11:52.852 --> 00:11:54.391
Positions. Now.

168
00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:06.572
You're stupider than pigs.

169
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:11.942
Look at how Hae Joo solved her question.

170
00:12:12.942 --> 00:12:14.742
Isn't this a work of art?

171
00:12:14.742 --> 00:12:16.551
You eat like everyone else,

172
00:12:16.551 --> 00:12:18.582
and poop like everyone else,

173
00:12:18.582 --> 00:12:19.881
but how are you so different?

174
00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:22.452
Jung Hee. Are you ready?

175
00:12:23.822 --> 00:12:24.921
Are you ready?

176
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:28.291
- Yes. - Okay.

177
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:30.761
Get ready.

178
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:33.092
Why aren't you getting ready?

179
00:12:33.092 --> 00:12:35.001
- Get ready. - Get ready.

180
00:12:35.001 --> 00:12:36.001
Mr. Oh!

181
00:12:36.771 --> 00:12:38.531
Yes, Hae Joo?

182
00:12:40.072 --> 00:12:43.312
I'd like you not to give punishments like that.

183
00:12:44.242 --> 00:12:46.271
- What? - I understand...

184
00:12:46.442 --> 00:12:49.681
that you wish to lead us down the proper path,

185
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:52.212
but using female students' underwear...

186
00:12:52.352 --> 00:12:53.852
will...

187
00:12:53.881 --> 00:12:57.551
humiliate the students, in my opinion.

188
00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:00.192
A punishment that humiliates them...

189
00:13:00.192 --> 00:13:02.322
crosses the line from punishment...

190
00:13:02.322 --> 00:13:04.131
to unacceptable assault.

191
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:05.992
Don't you agree?

192
00:13:10.472 --> 00:13:11.472
What?

193
00:13:12.232 --> 00:13:13.541
Humiliation?

194
00:13:14.401 --> 00:13:15.472
Assault?

195
00:13:28.452 --> 00:13:31.891
If that's what you think, it's understandable.

196
00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:39.431
Fine. I'm consider your point of view.

197
00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:42.362
Hae Joo saved your lives.

198
00:13:42.362 --> 00:13:43.372
Sit down.

199
00:13:49.372 --> 00:13:52.011
What are you doing? Sit down.

200
00:13:56.551 --> 00:13:57.651
I didn't know.

201
00:13:57.952 --> 00:14:00.151
I only complained about his punishments...

202
00:14:00.352 --> 00:14:02.082
and accepted it.

203
00:14:02.251 --> 00:14:04.791
I only knew how to hold a grudge and wait...

204
00:14:04.822 --> 00:14:06.391
to get him back someday.

205
00:14:06.622 --> 00:14:09.891
I didn't know I could fight back face on.

206
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:19.102
I'll seriously consider Hae Joo's comments...

207
00:14:19.131 --> 00:14:22.442
and will not snap your bra strap as punishment.

208
00:14:26.712 --> 00:14:28.082
Can I...

209
00:14:28.082 --> 00:14:30.751
never surpass Hae Joo?

210
00:14:31.181 --> 00:14:33.722
(Military Training)

211
00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:49.301
Mr. Oh, is something wrong?

212
00:14:57.742 --> 00:14:59.041
Dang it.

213
00:14:59.472 --> 00:15:02.082
After 10 years of teaching, I, Oh Man Sang,

214
00:15:02.082 --> 00:15:03.812
have to tip toe around a student?

215
00:15:04.352 --> 00:15:05.852
What happened?

216
00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:08.181
Did Ae Sook threaten you?

217
00:15:18.192 --> 00:15:19.531
Did she threaten you?

218
00:15:19.862 --> 00:15:22.301
We're having an after party this week.

219
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:23.602
An after party?

220
00:15:23.872 --> 00:15:24.872
Yes

221
00:15:25.332 --> 00:15:28.472
We didn't have one after the broadcast show.

222
00:15:28.972 --> 00:15:30.041
Then...

223
00:15:30.572 --> 00:15:32.911
will everyone from Gyeryoon be there?

224
00:15:32.911 --> 00:15:36.381
Yes. I hear Jin is coming too.

225
00:15:47.891 --> 00:15:49.592
(Be a Patriot! Catch Spies!)

226
00:15:49.592 --> 00:15:51.031
No.

227
00:15:51.031 --> 00:15:52.062
Jung Hee.

228
00:15:52.692 --> 00:15:54.261
It's your dad.

229
00:15:56.671 --> 00:15:58.671
- Hello. - Hello.

230
00:16:04.942 --> 00:16:05.942
Eat.

231
00:16:06.242 --> 00:16:08.681
Are you disappointed it isn't ox knee soup?

232
00:16:08.681 --> 00:16:11.551
I don't like ox knee soup.

233
00:16:11.582 --> 00:16:12.582
Let's eat.

234
00:16:18.452 --> 00:16:19.521
Long time ago,

235
00:16:20.192 --> 00:16:22.891
your youngest aunt drowned.

236
00:16:24.362 --> 00:16:25.492
You never knew, right?

237
00:16:26.062 --> 00:16:29.001
You never even saw her face.

238
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:30.832
I used to carry her everywhere.

239
00:16:32.372 --> 00:16:33.801
But she fell in the river.

240
00:16:35.342 --> 00:16:36.342
Eat.

241
00:16:39.511 --> 00:16:40.712
Here are your vegetables.

242
00:16:41.712 --> 00:16:42.712
Here.

243
00:16:42.712 --> 00:16:46.112
Goodness. Young Choon...

244
00:16:47.222 --> 00:16:48.322
Goodbye.

245
00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:51.921
Okay. Bye.

246
00:16:54.962 --> 00:16:55.962
Jung Hee.

247
00:16:56.592 --> 00:16:58.931
Don't talk to that guy.

248
00:16:58.931 --> 00:17:00.531
I don't talk to him.

249
00:17:01.232 --> 00:17:02.232
Eat.

250
00:17:11.812 --> 00:17:13.241
Welcome home.

251
00:17:14.842 --> 00:17:16.911
- Hi, Jung Hee. - Why are you back?

252
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.481
Watch how you speak to the teacher.

253
00:17:18.481 --> 00:17:19.752
Teacher?

254
00:17:20.552 --> 00:17:23.292
Dong Moon isn't here to see you.

255
00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:26.391
Teacher, please go in.

256
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:27.391
Sure.

257
00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.161
You carry this in.

258
00:17:29.161 --> 00:17:30.161
Okay.

259
00:17:33.032 --> 00:17:34.901
- I'll go in now. - Please, go in.

260
00:17:40.572 --> 00:17:41.772
Tutoring?

261
00:17:41.901 --> 00:17:44.241
Dong Moon is Bong Soo's tutor?

262
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:45.741
Don't tell your father.

263
00:17:45.741 --> 00:17:48.681
I put the money he gave me for Bong Soo's tutoring...

264
00:17:48.812 --> 00:17:50.151
into a savings group.

265
00:17:50.151 --> 00:17:52.181
Father's so... What about me?

266
00:17:52.181 --> 00:17:54.681
You can sit in and join him.

267
00:17:54.681 --> 00:17:58.691
Hey. Dong Moon is the best in math at the school.

268
00:17:58.691 --> 00:18:00.161
He's nice.

269
00:18:00.161 --> 00:18:02.362
I mentioned it in passing,

270
00:18:02.362 --> 00:18:04.062
and he said he'd love to.

271
00:18:04.062 --> 00:18:05.562
I don't like him.

272
00:18:05.562 --> 00:18:07.002
Then forget it.

273
00:18:07.502 --> 00:18:09.401
I have a lot of work to do.

274
00:18:09.401 --> 00:18:11.802
- I'm leaving. - What about me?

275
00:18:12.431 --> 00:18:14.042
You can go in there or not.

276
00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:16.241
- Do as you wish. - No. A tutor.

277
00:18:16.241 --> 00:18:18.612
Nonsense. I brought a tutor already.

278
00:18:18.612 --> 00:18:20.012
Where are you going?

279
00:18:20.012 --> 00:18:21.082
To the factory!

280
00:18:36.792 --> 00:18:38.762
Darn it.

281
00:18:39.292 --> 00:18:40.461
It's so hard.

282
00:18:40.731 --> 00:18:42.802
I can't even understand the explanation.

283
00:18:46.641 --> 00:18:49.171
Look how Hae Joo solved it.

284
00:18:49.701 --> 00:18:51.711
Isn't this a work of art?

285
00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:53.681
Darn it.

286
00:19:06.292 --> 00:19:08.461
You still don't get it? I solve it for you.

287
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:09.931
You solved it?

288
00:19:10.092 --> 00:19:11.292
I don't get it.

289
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:14.762
Bong Soo. I guess we really are twins.

290
00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:21.641
Should we take a short break?

291
00:19:21.641 --> 00:19:23.641
Let me use the bathroom.

292
00:19:26.042 --> 00:19:27.582
Sure.

293
00:19:27.582 --> 00:19:30.012
Don't just pee. Poop.

294
00:19:30.981 --> 00:19:32.012
Okay.

295
00:19:45.032 --> 00:19:46.032
That...

296
00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:48.332
isn't how you do it.

297
00:19:49.701 --> 00:19:50.901
You need to subtract.

298
00:19:51.631 --> 00:19:54.201
You scared me. What is it?

299
00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:57.612
There's a really easy way to solve that.

300
00:19:59.441 --> 00:20:00.612
Shall I teach you?

301
00:20:02.181 --> 00:20:03.211
Forget it.

302
00:20:05.352 --> 00:20:07.522
I'll teach you just one. Okay?

303
00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.151
Just one.

304
00:20:10.491 --> 00:20:14.022
Fine. Just one, okay?

305
00:20:17.461 --> 00:20:20.631
Three x plus three.

306
00:20:22.802 --> 00:20:25.302
Why does it result in that?

307
00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:28.102
Well...

308
00:20:28.401 --> 00:20:32.411
It's because you're slightly weak in math.

309
00:20:34.641 --> 00:20:35.641
Look.

310
00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:41.252
Look carefully.

311
00:20:41.522 --> 00:20:42.582
I am.

312
00:20:42.681 --> 00:20:45.151
3 minus A cubed plus 1.

313
00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:47.991
3 A squared minus A.

314
00:20:48.822 --> 00:20:52.631
3 minus A cubed minus 1 is minus 3 A cubed.

315
00:20:52.792 --> 00:20:54.401
Give it to me.

316
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:56.731
Look.

317
00:20:57.032 --> 00:20:59.901
Why haven't you been paying us lately?

318
00:21:01.141 --> 00:21:02.471
I have no money.

319
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:03.842
Why you...

320
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:05.171
Search it.

321
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:08.211
For every penny we find, you get a punch.

322
00:21:08.512 --> 00:21:09.512
Come here.

323
00:21:09.612 --> 00:21:11.211
- Get over here. - Take it easy.

324
00:21:11.211 --> 00:21:12.812
- Don't do it. - Give it to me.

325
00:21:12.812 --> 00:21:15.122
- Ki Ryuh. - Hae Joo.

326
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:19.352
Don't do that to her.

327
00:21:20.491 --> 00:21:21.691
- Let's go. - Hey.

328
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:25.292
Seoul Chick. Then you pay.

329
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:27.131
I hear you're rich.

330
00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:29.262
You have a lot of money.

331
00:21:29.562 --> 00:21:32.072
Ae Sook, let's not make trouble.

332
00:21:32.431 --> 00:21:33.772
You pay...

333
00:21:34.302 --> 00:21:36.671
- the tax. - How much do you need?

334
00:21:37.042 --> 00:21:38.911
I'll lend it to you. But...

335
00:21:39.981 --> 00:21:40.981
pay me back.

336
00:21:42.612 --> 00:21:44.981
Is this how Seoul kids take money?

337
00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:46.921
Is it?

338
00:21:48.151 --> 00:21:49.252
Ae Sook.

339
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:50.891
Don't use violence.

340
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:52.752
This is why you're called a pig and a dog...

341
00:21:52.752 --> 00:21:53.891
and are disrespected.

342
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:55.362
You witch.

343
00:21:55.661 --> 00:21:57.832
You think you're all that because Oh Man Sang...

344
00:21:57.832 --> 00:21:59.292
kisses up to you?

345
00:21:59.292 --> 00:22:01.102
You're a princess only within the school,

346
00:22:01.102 --> 00:22:02.201
not outside.

347
00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:04.631
Don't do that to Hae Joo.

348
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:06.102
I'll pay you.

349
00:22:06.231 --> 00:22:07.542
Shoot.

350
00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:10.072
Hey, Ae Sook.

351
00:22:11.042 --> 00:22:12.112
What are you doing?

352
00:22:12.542 --> 00:22:14.481
- Young Choon. - Should I...

353
00:22:14.911 --> 00:22:16.141
call the cops?

354
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:19.252
Should I? Should I call the cops?

355
00:22:20.052 --> 00:22:21.352
Want to go to jail?

356
00:22:25.122 --> 00:22:26.191
Dismissed.

357
00:22:28.592 --> 00:22:30.691
Dismissed. I said you're dismissed.

358
00:22:30.691 --> 00:22:31.731
Go on.

359
00:22:31.731 --> 00:22:33.032
Shoot. Seriously.

360
00:22:33.032 --> 00:22:34.862
That was for Eng Cho.

361
00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:36.461
Peanut.

362
00:22:37.431 --> 00:22:39.032
I told you not to do this.

363
00:22:39.302 --> 00:22:40.701
Are you a gangster?

364
00:22:40.872 --> 00:22:42.901
She started it.

365
00:22:48.411 --> 00:22:49.481
Let's go.

366
00:22:51.512 --> 00:22:53.181
Thank your lucky stars.

367
00:22:55.881 --> 00:22:57.052
Let's go.

368
00:22:57.421 --> 00:22:58.491
Okay.

369
00:23:00.092 --> 00:23:02.391
Where are we going?

370
00:23:03.862 --> 00:23:06.762
Young Choon, do you have time today?

371
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:10.671
Should I wait until the pharmacy closes?

372
00:23:14.201 --> 00:23:15.241
Ae Sook.

373
00:23:15.802 --> 00:23:16.812
Yes?

374
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:20.241
Don't live like this. You'll regret it later.

375
00:23:27.282 --> 00:23:28.451
Eat this.

376
00:23:29.852 --> 00:23:31.022
Be a good girl.

377
00:23:33.691 --> 00:23:34.822
Bye.

378
00:23:40.862 --> 00:23:43.772
If you put X over A...

379
00:23:45.072 --> 00:23:46.131
Then...

380
00:23:50.112 --> 00:23:52.612
F dash A...

381
00:23:52.872 --> 00:23:54.782
and then...

382
00:23:57.582 --> 00:23:58.681
Hae Joo.

383
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:10.161
Jin. Jin!

384
00:24:14.802 --> 00:24:17.272
Jin. Jin!

385
00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:20.471
Jin!

386
00:24:37.292 --> 00:24:40.362
I thought I was over him.

387
00:24:46.092 --> 00:24:47.231
It's cold.

388
00:24:48.102 --> 00:24:49.701
Trying to remove...

389
00:24:50.201 --> 00:24:53.171
a hot stone from within my heart,

390
00:24:53.872 --> 00:24:55.901
it's so cold.

391
00:25:10.451 --> 00:25:11.852
Oh no!

392
00:25:12.552 --> 00:25:14.622
Did I rub my face too hard last night?

393
00:25:22.832 --> 00:25:24.171
Hello.

394
00:25:25.032 --> 00:25:26.372
Hello.

395
00:25:26.802 --> 00:25:28.441
Hello.

396
00:25:32.971 --> 00:25:35.542
What are you doing? Come in.

397
00:25:35.911 --> 00:25:36.981
Okay!

398
00:25:54.502 --> 00:25:55.661
That moment,

399
00:25:56.401 --> 00:25:58.502
all the effort I put into forgetting Jin...

400
00:25:58.872 --> 00:26:01.042
over the past few days...

401
00:26:03.342 --> 00:26:04.471
How have you been?

402
00:26:07.842 --> 00:26:08.911
Well.

403
00:26:09.842 --> 00:26:11.582
It went up in smoke.

404
00:26:12.211 --> 00:26:15.252
He was still the person that I longed for,

405
00:26:15.822 --> 00:26:18.092
the person I wanted to see.

406
00:26:25.862 --> 00:26:28.802
Is Hae Joo not coming?

407
00:26:29.832 --> 00:26:33.171
She had to go home to take care of something.

408
00:26:35.141 --> 00:26:36.201
I see.

409
00:26:37.612 --> 00:26:38.772
I knew it.

410
00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:41.911
He's disappointed that Hae Joo isn't here.

411
00:26:42.211 --> 00:26:43.681
He's so cruel.

412
00:26:44.252 --> 00:26:47.322
And yet, I'm still so happy to see him.

413
00:26:47.322 --> 00:26:48.622
What's wrong with me?

414
00:26:50.151 --> 00:26:53.122
What else? You're a stupid idiot.

415
00:26:57.762 --> 00:26:58.832
Jung Hee.

416
00:27:00.102 --> 00:27:01.401
Let's talk.

417
00:27:09.471 --> 00:27:10.512
- Last time... - Last time...

418
00:27:16.552 --> 00:27:17.582
You first.

419
00:27:19.451 --> 00:27:20.681
Last time...

420
00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:25.022
When I went to your school...

421
00:27:26.292 --> 00:27:28.562
I was out of line.

422
00:27:31.562 --> 00:27:32.592
Jung Hee.

423
00:27:33.661 --> 00:27:35.102
You knew, right?

424
00:27:36.262 --> 00:27:37.572
How did you...

425
00:27:38.372 --> 00:27:40.641
- Did Hae Joo say that? - No.

426
00:27:44.842 --> 00:27:45.941
I saw you.

427
00:28:03.762 --> 00:28:04.832
Jung Hee.

428
00:28:07.302 --> 00:28:08.631
I'm sorry.

429
00:28:10.671 --> 00:28:12.201
I didn't have bad intentions...

430
00:28:13.241 --> 00:28:14.741
for not telling you.

431
00:28:16.711 --> 00:28:18.872
I just didn't want to hurt you,

432
00:28:20.012 --> 00:28:21.411
since you liked me so.

433
00:28:24.252 --> 00:28:27.651
And it was kind of embarrassing...

434
00:28:29.782 --> 00:28:31.221
to say...

435
00:28:32.292 --> 00:28:33.862
that I liked Hae Joo.

436
00:28:41.002 --> 00:28:42.332
I apologize.

437
00:28:43.832 --> 00:28:44.931
I'm sorry.

438
00:28:45.131 --> 00:28:47.971
If you do this... If you do this,

439
00:28:48.542 --> 00:28:50.641
I can't hate you.

440
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:55.112
Let's stay as friends.

441
00:28:58.752 --> 00:28:59.782
What do you say?

442
00:29:08.292 --> 00:29:10.532
The broadcasting clubs are meeting today.

443
00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:13.401
So,

444
00:29:13.931 --> 00:29:16.971
if we fill in one for the value of X,

445
00:29:16.971 --> 00:29:20.372
Y is 3 times 1 squared minus 1.

446
00:29:21.401 --> 00:29:22.471
Okay?

447
00:29:26.342 --> 00:29:29.211
That means... This is one.

448
00:29:29.241 --> 00:29:30.951
Do you add or subtract here?

449
00:29:32.911 --> 00:29:34.282
Do you add or subtract?

450
00:29:34.622 --> 00:29:36.282
Do whatever you want.

451
00:29:37.852 --> 00:29:38.951
Fine.

452
00:29:43.891 --> 00:29:45.731
I'm home, Dad.

453
00:29:48.332 --> 00:29:49.532
Dad.

454
00:29:50.901 --> 00:29:52.171
Did he go out?

455
00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:10.421
Kyung Soo. Are you okay?

456
00:30:10.792 --> 00:30:13.191
Oh no. What do I do?

457
00:30:16.522 --> 00:30:17.691
Have a nice day.

458
00:30:21.802 --> 00:30:24.102
- What's wrong? - Is the pharmacist out?

459
00:30:24.272 --> 00:30:25.471
He's at the police station...

460
00:30:25.802 --> 00:30:29.002
at a town disciplinary committee meeting.

461
00:30:29.701 --> 00:30:30.812
Something like that.

462
00:30:32.012 --> 00:30:33.312
Oh no.

463
00:30:34.441 --> 00:30:35.812
He should be back soon.

464
00:30:39.512 --> 00:30:42.181
Please help me.

465
00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:43.891
Sorry?

466
00:30:55.832 --> 00:30:58.171
I may not be trained,

467
00:30:58.701 --> 00:31:00.342
but I can read pulses a little.

468
00:31:01.971 --> 00:31:03.411
Even if you don't believe me.

469
00:31:05.012 --> 00:31:06.112
I believe you.

470
00:31:20.322 --> 00:31:23.661
I think he may have indigestion.

471
00:31:24.691 --> 00:31:26.231
Do you have a needle and thread?

472
00:31:42.255 --> 00:31:45.487
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E04 Girls' Generation 1979 "One Step Closer"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

473
00:31:58.131 --> 00:32:01.562
Someone like me shouldn't be doing this.

474
00:32:03.901 --> 00:32:04.971
But...

475
00:32:05.901 --> 00:32:07.502
why can't he go to the hospital?

476
00:32:12.941 --> 00:32:15.711
Thank you for your help.

477
00:32:20.181 --> 00:32:21.181
Excuse me.

478
00:32:24.022 --> 00:32:26.322
Please have some water before you go.

479
00:32:28.362 --> 00:32:29.362
I'm fine.

480
00:32:29.792 --> 00:32:31.262
Please...

481
00:33:10.872 --> 00:33:11.872
So...

482
00:33:13.302 --> 00:33:14.741
About today...

483
00:33:14.741 --> 00:33:15.872
Don't worry.

484
00:33:17.711 --> 00:33:19.141
I won't tell anyone.

485
00:33:34.762 --> 00:33:35.762
You don't want to be...

486
00:33:36.362 --> 00:33:37.562
good friends?

487
00:33:57.411 --> 00:33:58.881
I wanted to forget him.

488
00:33:59.651 --> 00:34:01.782
Why is he pulling me back in?

489
00:34:09.091 --> 00:34:10.361
Did you hold hands...

490
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:12.161
with Jin?

491
00:34:13.132 --> 00:34:14.132
What?

492
00:34:15.102 --> 00:34:16.931
I heard the broadcast club had an after party.

493
00:34:18.402 --> 00:34:19.402
Were you happy?

494
00:34:19.801 --> 00:34:22.672
Happy about what? I wasn't happy at all.

495
00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:26.781
What?

496
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:28.442
You have a doorbell on your forehead.

497
00:34:28.812 --> 00:34:29.911
Were you that happy?

498
00:34:34.082 --> 00:34:35.352
Why that...

499
00:34:56.002 --> 00:34:57.111
Excuse me.

500
00:35:03.281 --> 00:35:04.752
Is he sick again?

501
00:35:05.082 --> 00:35:07.922
No. Thanks to you, mister...

502
00:35:10.491 --> 00:35:14.221
I mean, thanks to you, he's much better.

503
00:35:14.462 --> 00:35:16.692
Good. I'm glad.

504
00:35:19.161 --> 00:35:20.161
Well...

505
00:35:22.332 --> 00:35:23.531
Here.

506
00:35:24.172 --> 00:35:25.272
These are for you.

507
00:35:29.042 --> 00:35:30.172
Are those socks?

508
00:35:30.411 --> 00:35:31.872
I wanted to thank you.

509
00:35:32.772 --> 00:35:35.382
It's fine. Take them back.

510
00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:37.011
Please take them.

511
00:35:37.911 --> 00:35:39.082
Take them back.

512
00:35:47.991 --> 00:35:49.261
You wear them.

513
00:35:50.332 --> 00:35:51.891
They're men's socks.

514
00:35:55.201 --> 00:35:56.201
Then...

515
00:35:57.602 --> 00:35:59.272
give them to your father.

516
00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:08.511
You wear them, mister.

517
00:36:08.582 --> 00:36:10.252
I said I'm not a "mister".

518
00:36:11.511 --> 00:36:13.011
- That's right. - Young Choon.

519
00:36:15.451 --> 00:36:16.522
Ae Sook.

520
00:36:21.861 --> 00:36:22.861
Okay then.

521
00:36:26.832 --> 00:36:28.301
Wait. These...

522
00:36:33.372 --> 00:36:34.372
What was that?

523
00:36:34.772 --> 00:36:37.071
What? It's nothing.

524
00:36:39.372 --> 00:36:42.042
What were you and Hae Joo talking about?

525
00:36:42.042 --> 00:36:45.082
We weren't talking about anything.

526
00:36:45.082 --> 00:36:46.511
I sold her medicine.

527
00:36:49.281 --> 00:36:50.292
You.

528
00:36:50.821 --> 00:36:52.622
Get home quickly.

529
00:36:52.951 --> 00:36:54.091
I need to sell medicine.

530
00:37:08.672 --> 00:37:09.672
About...

531
00:37:10.011 --> 00:37:11.341
that girl, Hae Joo.

532
00:37:11.542 --> 00:37:15.341
- Are you still seeing her? - No.

533
00:37:15.611 --> 00:37:18.152
Don't talk to her ever again. Got it?

534
00:37:21.551 --> 00:37:22.652
Why is that?

535
00:37:25.321 --> 00:37:27.721
Hae Joo is the daughter...

536
00:37:27.962 --> 00:37:29.122
of a communist.

537
00:37:29.591 --> 00:37:32.062
- What? - Watch yourself...

538
00:37:32.361 --> 00:37:34.761
unless you want to destroy your father's life.

539
00:37:41.571 --> 00:37:42.571
Then...

540
00:37:43.002 --> 00:37:46.212
you have no idea where my father is?

541
00:37:50.382 --> 00:37:51.382
Okay.

542
00:37:54.652 --> 00:37:55.852
I understand.

543
00:38:10.071 --> 00:38:12.132
The professor isn't there either?

544
00:38:14.442 --> 00:38:15.442
No.

545
00:38:17.911 --> 00:38:19.672
My father always calls...

546
00:38:20.812 --> 00:38:22.641
if he can't come home.

547
00:38:40.261 --> 00:38:43.161
Hae Joo is the daughter of a communist.

548
00:38:43.161 --> 00:38:44.602
Watch yourself...

549
00:38:45.232 --> 00:38:47.701
unless you want to destroy your father's life.

550
00:39:05.122 --> 00:39:06.122
Dad.

551
00:39:12.861 --> 00:39:14.031
Jin.

552
00:39:15.462 --> 00:39:16.672
What is it?

553
00:39:16.971 --> 00:39:17.971
Is everything...

554
00:39:18.632 --> 00:39:19.872
okay?

555
00:39:21.071 --> 00:39:22.071
Yes.

556
00:39:22.372 --> 00:39:23.812
Is everything really okay?

557
00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:26.641
It's late.

558
00:39:27.712 --> 00:39:28.911
Good night.

559
00:39:58.241 --> 00:39:59.312
Finally,

560
00:40:00.212 --> 00:40:02.741
the midterms have been scheduled.

561
00:40:04.712 --> 00:40:07.652
Our class' midterms, finals, and national...

562
00:40:07.752 --> 00:40:08.922
mock exams...

563
00:40:09.252 --> 00:40:13.221
have always been the lowest score.

564
00:40:13.321 --> 00:40:15.161
But we have a chance to rise up.

565
00:40:15.522 --> 00:40:16.962
Especially now,

566
00:40:17.792 --> 00:40:20.002
since Hae Joo, whose mock exam score...

567
00:40:20.132 --> 00:40:22.332
was the highest in the nation is here,

568
00:40:23.301 --> 00:40:24.672
our class may be able...

569
00:40:25.232 --> 00:40:27.172
to at least avoid being last.

570
00:40:27.542 --> 00:40:29.341
Who knows? Perhaps...

571
00:40:29.341 --> 00:40:31.212
we'll actually come in first.

572
00:40:32.212 --> 00:40:34.741
I'm hesitant, but hopeful.

573
00:40:37.982 --> 00:40:39.712
Especially you guys.

574
00:40:40.551 --> 00:40:41.551
You guys.

575
00:40:41.951 --> 00:40:44.391
You representative delinquents.

576
00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:46.761
Jung Hee!

577
00:40:49.292 --> 00:40:52.091
Study hard for this, got it?

578
00:40:52.462 --> 00:40:55.661
Darn it. He's always picking on us.

579
00:41:40.082 --> 00:41:41.482
Did something happen?

580
00:41:43.042 --> 00:41:44.882
Is it because of Jin?

581
00:41:47.951 --> 00:41:50.752
(Kim's Pharmacy)

582
00:41:50.752 --> 00:41:51.752
Excuse me.

583
00:41:54.761 --> 00:41:55.922
I noticed before...

584
00:41:56.491 --> 00:41:58.261
that your kitchen ceiling was leaking.

585
00:42:01.962 --> 00:42:03.272
Is something wrong?

586
00:42:04.402 --> 00:42:05.801
My dad...

587
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:08.801
hasn't come home for several days.

588
00:42:10.411 --> 00:42:12.111
He hasn't even called.

589
00:42:23.292 --> 00:42:24.692
Please help me.

590
00:42:28.991 --> 00:42:30.391
How long has it been?

591
00:42:30.391 --> 00:42:31.761
It's been a few days.

592
00:42:32.462 --> 00:42:35.562
He's never not come home without calling before.

593
00:42:38.832 --> 00:42:39.902
Hae Joo!

594
00:42:44.372 --> 00:42:47.141
What is it? What did you say to her?

595
00:42:47.341 --> 00:42:49.582
- It's not like that. - What did you say?

596
00:42:49.582 --> 00:42:52.082
- Jung Hee. - I'll look into it.

597
00:42:53.082 --> 00:42:54.681
What was it? Where are you going?

598
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:57.352
It's not like that. I asked him for a favor.

599
00:42:57.792 --> 00:42:58.852
What?

600
00:43:02.562 --> 00:43:04.132
I need to go home.

601
00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:05.431
See you tomorrow.

602
00:43:06.361 --> 00:43:07.431
Hae Joo.

603
00:43:10.602 --> 00:43:11.872
Be careful...

604
00:43:12.931 --> 00:43:14.071
of Young Choon.

605
00:43:14.801 --> 00:43:18.172
You shouldn't talk to him and stuff.

606
00:43:20.812 --> 00:43:22.141
Thanks.

607
00:43:22.942 --> 00:43:24.152
But...

608
00:43:25.212 --> 00:43:27.652
he isn't such a bad person.

609
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:21.301
Dad.

610
00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:24.812
Kyung Soo.

611
00:44:31.852 --> 00:44:33.721
- Sir. - Hey.

612
00:44:34.522 --> 00:44:37.152
Have you seen this man?

613
00:44:38.391 --> 00:44:39.591
No, I haven't.

614
00:44:44.962 --> 00:44:46.962
Please let me know.

615
00:44:47.462 --> 00:44:48.962
I'll be in touch.

616
00:45:08.721 --> 00:45:11.051
I wonder if something's going on with Hae Joo.

617
00:45:14.091 --> 00:45:15.321
Jung Hee.

618
00:45:17.891 --> 00:45:19.091
A study room?

619
00:45:20.002 --> 00:45:21.102
Quiet.

620
00:45:22.332 --> 00:45:24.602
Mom got you a pass to a study room?

621
00:45:25.672 --> 00:45:27.201
- Mom! - Jung Hee.

622
00:45:27.402 --> 00:45:30.812
Go to the study room in my place.

623
00:45:31.071 --> 00:45:32.312
I'll give you my pass.

624
00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:35.042
No! I want my own.

625
00:45:35.042 --> 00:45:36.882
I'll give you this too.

626
00:45:37.011 --> 00:45:40.181
I saved my allowance to buy something.

627
00:45:40.281 --> 00:45:43.752
You get to study thanks to me and make money.

628
00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:46.122
This is your lucky day.

629
00:45:53.091 --> 00:45:56.232
- Darn it. Mom! - I'll give you my piggy.

630
00:45:57.172 --> 00:45:58.232
You know...

631
00:45:58.872 --> 00:46:01.241
I have a big piggy living in my room, right?

632
00:46:01.772 --> 00:46:03.002
I...

633
00:46:03.241 --> 00:46:05.611
saved up all my birthday money, allowance,

634
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:08.042
everything since I was a baby.

635
00:46:08.712 --> 00:46:10.212
I'll give it to you whole.

636
00:46:10.812 --> 00:46:13.422
They'll call home if I don't show up.

637
00:46:14.122 --> 00:46:15.281
Jung Hee.

638
00:46:16.652 --> 00:46:18.522
- Where is it? - Will you go?

639
00:46:30.132 --> 00:46:31.602
(Boys' Study Room)

640
00:46:33.241 --> 00:46:35.002
(Girls' Study Room)

641
00:46:37.971 --> 00:46:41.542
Bong Soo. Of all the things...

642
00:46:43.382 --> 00:46:45.882
But then again, I get to study...

643
00:46:46.352 --> 00:46:47.551
and make money.

644
00:46:49.422 --> 00:46:51.391
It's just one week.

645
00:47:02.632 --> 00:47:03.732
Go in.

646
00:47:21.821 --> 00:47:23.022
Stinky.

647
00:47:26.622 --> 00:47:29.022
Okay, Jung Hee. You can do it.

648
00:47:29.522 --> 00:47:32.161
Let's try getting into a special class.

649
00:47:39.172 --> 00:47:40.201
What?

650
00:47:40.772 --> 00:47:42.341
You won't go to the study room?

651
00:47:46.312 --> 00:47:47.582
This is a great opportunity.

652
00:47:47.641 --> 00:47:50.712
I'll say I'm studying, and party all night instead.

653
00:47:52.111 --> 00:47:54.821
Bong Soo. Have you lost your mind?

654
00:47:55.022 --> 00:47:56.122
That's right.

655
00:47:56.181 --> 00:47:59.622
Don't you know they'll call home if you don't go?

656
00:47:59.622 --> 00:48:00.891
I know that.

657
00:48:01.062 --> 00:48:04.531
That's why the second Lee Bong Soo is there.

658
00:48:05.962 --> 00:48:09.402
Otherwise known as Lee Jung Hee.

659
00:48:10.701 --> 00:48:11.801
What?

660
00:48:13.402 --> 00:48:14.542
It's full?

661
00:48:14.701 --> 00:48:17.911
It's exam time, so it's full.

662
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:22.442
Then is Bong...

663
00:48:22.882 --> 00:48:26.411
No, no. I can't risk getting her caught.

664
00:48:29.891 --> 00:48:33.821
May I go in briefly to talk to a friend?

665
00:48:38.991 --> 00:48:41.361
(No outsiders)

666
00:49:04.721 --> 00:49:07.591
She'll come out eventually.

667
00:49:19.372 --> 00:49:22.402
Jung Hee's studying so hard.

668
00:49:54.902 --> 00:49:57.071
So? Did you find out?

669
00:49:57.571 --> 00:49:58.712
Well...

670
00:50:02.411 --> 00:50:04.312
I looked everywhere...

671
00:50:11.152 --> 00:50:12.522
I'll look more.

672
00:50:25.102 --> 00:50:26.431
Why were you out here?

673
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:28.542
Go inside.

674
00:50:32.341 --> 00:50:33.681
I was too scared.

675
00:50:40.051 --> 00:50:41.451
You should go.

676
00:50:42.022 --> 00:50:43.951
Eng Cho must be waiting.

677
00:50:46.422 --> 00:50:48.721
Eng Cho is sleeping.

678
00:50:49.422 --> 00:50:50.991
What if...

679
00:50:51.991 --> 00:50:55.261
something happened to my dad?

680
00:51:01.241 --> 00:51:02.641
Don't be afraid.

681
00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:06.071
I'm here.

682
00:51:37.741 --> 00:51:39.241
What's going on?

683
00:51:39.911 --> 00:51:41.312
Jin is...

684
00:51:42.982 --> 00:51:44.982
No.

685
00:52:40.172 --> 00:52:44.911
(Rainbow Study Room)

686
00:52:46.611 --> 00:52:48.111
Is it curfew already?

687
00:53:16.071 --> 00:53:17.141
Well,

688
00:53:17.872 --> 00:53:19.872
I have no choice.

689
00:53:20.712 --> 00:53:22.011
Does this mean...

690
00:53:22.611 --> 00:53:24.252
I'll be spending...

691
00:53:24.812 --> 00:53:27.422
my first night with Jin tonight?

692
00:53:36.792 --> 00:53:39.861
Jung Hee. You stupid girl.

693
00:53:40.661 --> 00:53:41.931
Are you that happy?

694
00:53:46.672 --> 00:53:48.801
Yes, I am.

695
00:53:49.402 --> 00:53:50.911
I can't help it.

696
00:53:55.442 --> 00:53:56.781
Jin.

697
00:54:43.931 --> 00:54:46.391
I wish time would stop.

698
00:54:58.372 --> 00:55:03.681
(Rainbow Study Room)

699
00:55:11.122 --> 00:55:12.152
2:40am...

700
00:57:00.332 --> 00:57:02.062
Why did it have to be next to Jin?

701
00:57:36.431 --> 00:57:38.632
Jung Hee. Don't worry.

702
00:57:39.232 --> 00:57:41.772
I'll protect you tonight.

703
00:57:42.841 --> 00:57:45.312
(Rainbow Study Room)

704
00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:20.442
(Rainbow Study Room)

705
00:58:25.551 --> 00:58:27.721
I feel so stiff.

706
00:58:27.721 --> 00:58:31.221
Uhn Joo. She says she never studies.

707
00:58:31.221 --> 00:58:32.752
Where should we eat?

708
00:58:32.752 --> 00:58:34.721
They'll get the wrong idea if they see me.

709
00:58:35.261 --> 00:58:37.361
What? What about him?

710
00:58:38.062 --> 00:58:40.801
- Whatever. - Aren't you sleepy?

711
00:58:41.632 --> 00:58:42.761
Seriously.

712
00:58:42.761 --> 00:58:44.071
Stop it.

713
00:58:44.632 --> 00:58:46.872
Gosh, I'm so tired.

714
00:58:47.172 --> 00:58:49.841
Let's go home.

715
00:58:51.712 --> 00:58:54.082
Darn it. What the...

716
00:58:59.681 --> 00:59:01.382
I have to go home.

717
00:59:04.622 --> 00:59:08.761
"Potential. Having the capacity to become..."

718
00:59:08.761 --> 00:59:09.931
Leap.

719
00:59:10.732 --> 00:59:13.062
To jump, spring.

720
00:59:14.332 --> 00:59:15.732
Adorable.

721
00:59:17.372 --> 00:59:18.571
Adorable.

722
00:59:19.571 --> 00:59:20.672
Adorable?

723
00:59:22.471 --> 00:59:23.741
Adorable?

724
00:59:24.341 --> 00:59:25.841
Adorable.

725
00:59:32.352 --> 00:59:35.122
Cute. Lovable.

726
00:59:36.382 --> 00:59:37.451
Pardon?

727
00:59:39.252 --> 00:59:40.361
Adorable.

728
00:59:41.122 --> 00:59:43.531
Cute. Lovable.

729
00:59:49.361 --> 00:59:50.372
Do you know...

730
00:59:51.201 --> 00:59:54.141
that you're kind of cute?

731
00:59:55.542 --> 00:59:58.312
What was that?

732
01:00:00.111 --> 01:00:04.312
I don't know English sentences yet.

733
01:00:10.951 --> 01:00:12.221
I mean you're cute.

734
01:00:13.991 --> 01:00:15.091
You. Jung Hee.

735
01:00:24.971 --> 01:00:26.531
Son Jin.
