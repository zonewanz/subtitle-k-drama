00:00:09.396 --> 00:00:11.131
Kang Soo!

3
00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:13.767
Kang Soo!

4
00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:31.184
Kang Soo!

5
00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:36.156
Kang Soo!

6
00:00:37.123 --> 00:00:39.926
Kang Soo!

00:00:41.294 --> 00:00:43.563
<i>[Final Episode]</i>

8
00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:49.369
It feels really empty since three
people left at the same time.

9
00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:53.239
No, it doesn't.
Those traitors.

10
00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.710
Yeah, I won't forgive those punks
until the day I die.

11
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.711
So disloyal!

12
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:02.182
This is 100 times more traitorous
than stealing your friend's woman!

13
00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:06.920
Huh?
Someone's calling you.

14
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.054
I'm not picking up!

15
00:01:09.222 --> 00:01:10.590
It's Sister-in-Law Dan Ah.

16
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.158
Oh! I wonder what she's calling about.

17
00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:16.730
Yes, Chairwoman?

18
00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:20.734
What?
What did you say?

19
00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:22.969
Yes, I understand.

20
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:26.406
This is bad, boys.

21
00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:29.075
- Kang Soo has disappeared!
- What?

22
00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:30.744
Hurry up and text the
people in our group chat.

23
00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:33.780
Wake up all 380 of them, and tell them
to search all of Seoul!

24
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.914
Yes, sir!

25
00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:36.649
Kang Soo, you bastard.

26
00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:42.856
You must know where he is.

27
00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:45.158
You're the closest to him, after all.

28
00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:48.094
I don't know, either.
He didn't contact me.

29
00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:49.963
Why would he contact someone like me?

30
00:01:49.963 --> 00:01:52.432
I'm sure you have some
guesses, though, at least!

31
00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:00.840
<i>Go to Kang Soo's hometown.</i>

32
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.542
<i>That's the only place he
could've gone if he left Seoul.</i>

33
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:53.126
Father.

34
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:56.429
I'm here.

35
00:03:07.707 --> 00:03:09.642
Choi Kang Soo has disappeared?

36
00:03:09.642 --> 00:03:12.245
Yes, I think he's given up on
everything, and has left.

37
00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:13.680
When I went to Strongest
Deliveryman's website

38
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.250
I saw countless posts from deliverymen,
asking him to come back.

39
00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:22.222
So that's how he ended up after
being so reckless and immature.

40
00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:27.026
How's it going with the person
that we scouted?

41
00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:29.362
Our offer... was rejected.

42
00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:30.530
But, why?

43
00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:35.969
What is he planning to do at a company
that has pretty much closed down?

44
00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.404
I'm... not sure.

45
00:03:38.404 --> 00:03:40.640
So Ms. Dan Ah went to
Kang Soo's hometown, then?

46
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.708
Yeah.

47
00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:44.944
She said that she'll bring him back
if he's there, no matter what it takes.

48
00:03:44.944 --> 00:03:46.579
He even took our sign off
before he left, though.

49
00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.181
Do you think he'll be convinced
to come back so easily?

50
00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:50.183
At any rate, we'll just
have to wait and see.

51
00:04:08.434 --> 00:04:10.470
<i>[Choi Tae Ho]</i>

52
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.948
Dan Ah.

53
00:04:26.586 --> 00:04:30.023
Is this all you amounted to?
Were you always such a quitter?

54
00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:34.027
- Dan Ah.
- Tell me.

55
00:04:34.827 --> 00:04:36.696
Were you always this kind of person?

56
00:04:36.696 --> 00:04:38.565
You were the type to leave your
employees behind and run off

57
00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:39.933
because your company
wasn't doing well?

58
00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:42.669
You promised me that
we'd face everything together.

59
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.205
And yet, you were the type to disappear
and only leave behind a note?

60
00:04:47.106 --> 00:04:51.177
Did you think I'd be happy
if you left like that?

61
00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.214
Even if I emigrate to a
really nice country to live in

62
00:04:55.214 --> 00:04:57.750
do you think I'd be able
to be happy without you?

63
00:05:02.188 --> 00:05:04.223
Head back to Seoul, right now.

64
00:05:04.223 --> 00:05:05.892
Go, and start over.

65
00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:08.494
Don't disappoint me any further.

66
00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:15.468
Go back.

67
00:05:15.468 --> 00:05:16.936
Kang Soo.

68
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.806
You should leave now, too.

69
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.976
You can be happy without me.

70
00:05:23.876 --> 00:05:25.144
Choi Kang Soo!

71
00:05:25.144 --> 00:05:26.946
Things may be difficult right now...

72
00:05:27.847 --> 00:05:29.782
but you'll be okay
when some time passes.

73
00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:31.284
It was like that for me.

74
00:05:31.284 --> 00:05:33.086
On the day that my
father passed away...

75
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.623
I didn't think I'd be able to eat
even a single bite.

76
00:05:36.623 --> 00:05:38.191
I thought...

77
00:05:38.191 --> 00:05:40.059
that I'd never be able to
smile ever again.

78
00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:41.160
But...

79
00:05:41.728 --> 00:05:43.763
that wasn't the case.

80
00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:46.432
I made friends...

81
00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:50.470
and I smiled again, after meeting you.

82
00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:53.606
Kang Soo, please!

83
00:05:53.606 --> 00:05:55.274
You can do that, too.

84
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.078
Bury me in the corner of
your heart, and live on.

85
00:05:59.078 --> 00:06:00.313
Do that.

86
00:06:00.913 --> 00:06:03.216
And even it takes a long time...

87
00:06:03.983 --> 00:06:05.818
do that, and be happy again.

88
00:06:11.157 --> 00:06:12.692
Leave.

89
00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:15.028
And don't ever come back.

90
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.235
What about you, then?

91
00:06:24.237 --> 00:06:26.239
What are you going to do?

92
00:06:31.377 --> 00:06:33.613
Will you really be okay without me?

93
00:06:36.516 --> 00:06:38.151
Will you really be able to smile again?

94
00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:44.390
Do you really want to live on...

95
00:06:45.091 --> 00:06:46.993
forgetting me?

96
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.764
Yeah.

97
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.759
The more I think about it,
the stranger it seems.

98
00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:53.826
What do you mean?

99
00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:55.228
The fact that the ingredients
got swapped out.

100
00:07:55.228 --> 00:07:57.697
The food company wasn't able
to find anything wrong on their end.

101
00:07:57.697 --> 00:08:00.233
And the people from my hometown
aren't the type of people to do that.

102
00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:04.270
That's why we're saying that Ms. Park
was messing around, and got caught!

103
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.471
What if she wasn't, though?

104
00:08:06.606 --> 00:08:07.707
What?

105
00:08:07.707 --> 00:08:10.009
This could've happened without
Ms. Park knowing.

106
00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:11.477
What do you mean by that?

107
00:08:11.477 --> 00:08:16.649
Are you saying those domestic ingredients
somehow transformed themselves, then?

108
00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:18.785
No, that's not what I mean.

109
00:08:18.785 --> 00:08:20.653
I just feel like something is off.

110
00:08:22.388 --> 00:08:23.656
I believe you, Ms. Park.

111
00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:27.426
I've never once thought that you
swapped out the ingredients.

112
00:08:27.426 --> 00:08:31.597
So please, trust us just this once.

113
00:08:31.597 --> 00:08:35.034
So, what is it that you want to say?

114
00:08:35.034 --> 00:08:36.435
You have CCTV cameras here, right?

115
00:08:36.903 --> 00:08:39.305
Can I take a look at the
footage for just a bit?

116
00:08:45.545 --> 00:08:47.814
Isn't that woman a Head Manager
at Jung Family Foods?

117
00:08:47.814 --> 00:08:50.216
Why did that woman
come to my restaurant?

118
00:08:50.216 --> 00:08:51.884
Something definitely happened.

119
00:08:51.884 --> 00:08:53.786
I'll be looking at the footage from
the night before the officials showed up.

120
00:08:57.023 --> 00:08:58.558
What's going on?

121
00:08:58.558 --> 00:09:01.327
I think that lady turned the power off
and swapped out the ingredients.

122
00:09:01.327 --> 00:09:02.762
Oh, goodness!

123
00:09:02.762 --> 00:09:04.564
I'll dig deeper into this.

124
00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:07.867
We need to be perfectly prepared
so that they can't wriggle out of this.

125
00:09:43.836 --> 00:09:44.837
Get out of my way.

126
00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:48.541
I said get out of my way.

127
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.421
Eat.

128
00:10:03.723 --> 00:10:05.358
I'm not giving up on you.

129
00:10:05.358 --> 00:10:08.861
I've given up on so much already
that I can't do it anymore.

130
00:10:10.663 --> 00:10:12.832
So eat this, and chin up.

131
00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:16.335
I'm going to stay here until you do,
no matter what.

132
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.939
This cost me quite a lot.

133
00:10:20.439 --> 00:10:22.608
So eat all of it, and don't leave
any of it behind.

134
00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:52.438
Did you come here...
to see Kang Soo?

135
00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:53.739
Yeah.

136
00:10:53.739 --> 00:10:59.078
Hyun Soo told me that something may
have happened to him, so...

137
00:10:59.712 --> 00:11:03.115
And he's always been
so nice to Hyun Soo.

138
00:11:06.118 --> 00:11:08.254
Go ahead and go see him, then.

139
00:11:08.254 --> 00:11:09.522
No.

140
00:11:10.656 --> 00:11:12.591
I was just afraid that
he was alone here.

141
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:16.262
And that, while he was
alone, he'd...

142
00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:23.102
But you're by his side, I see.

143
00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:29.108
What's... your name?

144
00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:34.547
Dan Ah.

145
00:11:34.547 --> 00:11:36.048
Lee Dan Ah.

146
00:11:36.048 --> 00:11:38.551
Thank you, Dan Ah.

147
00:11:40.653 --> 00:11:42.588
I'll be leaving now.

148
00:11:42.588 --> 00:11:45.191
Don't tell him that you saw me here.

149
00:11:45.191 --> 00:11:46.892
Please.

150
00:11:49.028 --> 00:11:50.563
Just...

151
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.599
tell him that you're sorry.

152
00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.505
I heard about the whole situation.

153
00:12:00.873 --> 00:12:03.409
If you apologize to him...

154
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.645
I think that will fix things.

155
00:12:07.713 --> 00:12:11.384
Kang Soo is a good person, after all.

156
00:12:12.752 --> 00:12:16.288
It's because he's a good person
that I can't do that.

157
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.825
He's just too nice for his own good...

158
00:12:20.793 --> 00:12:23.629
so he'll try to forgive me
in any way he can.

159
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:25.197
Just like his father.

160
00:12:25.197 --> 00:12:27.666
All while harboring a lot
of pain in his heart.

161
00:12:28.267 --> 00:12:30.803
I don't want to hurt him anymore.

162
00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:33.973
Why did you come here, then?

163
00:12:33.973 --> 00:12:35.341
I don't know.

164
00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:37.009
I don't know, either.

165
00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:39.979
I have no idea what I was planning
to do by coming here.

166
00:12:43.049 --> 00:12:44.316
Please...

167
00:12:44.884 --> 00:12:46.652
take good care of Kang Soo.

<i>[Bus to Osanchon, Haje]</i>

169
00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:06.872
Mom!

170
00:13:11.844 --> 00:13:13.245
Hyun Soo.

171
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.422
What brings you here?

172
00:13:23.422 --> 00:13:25.491
I was worried about Kang Soo.

173
00:13:25.491 --> 00:13:28.794
Everyone in the group chat was up in
arms all night trying to find him.

174
00:13:28.794 --> 00:13:30.129
I told you.

175
00:13:30.129 --> 00:13:33.966
Ah, I see.

176
00:13:36.469 --> 00:13:38.237
But what brings you here, Mom?

177
00:13:39.238 --> 00:13:40.906
Um...

178
00:13:41.307 --> 00:13:43.275
My friend lives here.

179
00:13:43.275 --> 00:13:45.344
I came by to visit them for a bit.

180
00:13:46.812 --> 00:13:48.247
Your friend?
Who?

181
00:13:48.247 --> 00:13:50.382
Just someone.
You don't know them.

182
00:13:51.784 --> 00:13:53.285
Mom.

183
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.825
Did you come here to see
Kang Soo, by any chance?

184
00:13:59.825 --> 00:14:02.828
What are you talking about?

185
00:14:02.828 --> 00:14:04.563
You've been acting really weird
since yesterday

186
00:14:04.563 --> 00:14:08.267
when I told you that something
may have happened to Kang Soo.

187
00:14:08.267 --> 00:14:10.669
You didn't even hear me when
I called you a couple of times.

188
00:14:11.637 --> 00:14:13.005
Oh, really?

189
00:14:13.539 --> 00:14:15.541
I had no idea.

190
00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:17.743
Do you know Kang Soo, by any chance?

191
00:14:17.743 --> 00:14:19.145
How could I possibly know Kang Soo?

192
00:14:19.145 --> 00:14:20.779
Why are you acting like that, then?

193
00:14:22.948 --> 00:14:26.519
You've actually been acting weird since
the first day you met Kang Soo, Mom.

194
00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:29.522
You kept spacing out and got surprised
every time a customer came in!

195
00:14:30.256 --> 00:14:31.457
What is it?

196
00:14:32.224 --> 00:14:34.560
Tell me.
I'm not a kid anymore.

197
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:39.031
If you don't tell me, Mom...

198
00:14:39.932 --> 00:14:41.634
I'll go ask Kang Soo.

199
00:14:41.634 --> 00:14:42.801
Hyun Soo.

200
00:14:44.203 --> 00:14:46.238
I mean, Kang Soo has been
acting weird, too.

201
00:14:46.238 --> 00:14:47.806
He was acting weird...

202
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.876
when he picked up your call,
and when you came to pick me up.

203
00:14:54.747 --> 00:14:56.148
What is it, Mom?

204
00:14:57.149 --> 00:14:58.651
Tell me.

205
00:15:04.123 --> 00:15:08.093
What are we going to do when
Kang Soo comes back, though?

206
00:15:08.861 --> 00:15:10.896
I don't know, either.

207
00:15:10.896 --> 00:15:13.666
The company is pretty much closed now.

208
00:15:13.666 --> 00:15:17.203
This is because you guys stuck to
only delivering food.

209
00:15:17.203 --> 00:15:19.205
Do you have a plan?

210
00:15:19.205 --> 00:15:22.508
We can deliver flowers, laundry,
and even groceries.

211
00:15:22.508 --> 00:15:23.776
Can't we just do that?

212
00:15:23.776 --> 00:15:25.544
Let's broaden our affiliates list, here.

213
00:15:25.544 --> 00:15:27.913
Instead of just hanging around
Restaurant Row all day.

214
00:15:27.913 --> 00:15:29.982
Well, we need money to do that!

215
00:15:29.982 --> 00:15:31.717
It'll cost money
to hire more employees

216
00:15:31.717 --> 00:15:33.118
and it'll cost money to
advertise this, too!

217
00:15:33.118 --> 00:15:38.057
We're a corporation, Director.
A corporation, okay?

218
00:15:38.057 --> 00:15:40.459
If we need money, we can sell shares.

219
00:15:40.459 --> 00:15:41.794
And we can continue to
operate with that money.

220
00:15:41.794 --> 00:15:43.696
I've thought about doing that too.

221
00:15:43.696 --> 00:15:46.098
But do you think that there's anyone
who'd buy our company's shares now?

222
00:15:46.098 --> 00:15:48.300
- Well, Kang Soo has tons of friends!
- What?

223
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.469
You know, the guys who invested
100,000 won each.

224
00:15:50.469 --> 00:15:52.571
Ask them to give us a bit more money,
since they've already given us some.

225
00:15:56.642 --> 00:15:59.144
Yeah, let's give it a try.

226
00:15:59.912 --> 00:16:02.514
Let's do something while we
wait for Kang Soo to come back.

227
00:16:03.048 --> 00:16:05.351
I'm sure he's worn out.

228
00:16:06.151 --> 00:16:08.420
He's always been pulling us
all forward from the front.

229
00:16:08.921 --> 00:16:10.856
Let's try doing it instead, this time.

230
00:16:11.757 --> 00:16:15.494
Oh, I was just...
just about to say that! Yep!

231
00:16:15.494 --> 00:16:17.429
Yes, let's give it a shot!

232
00:16:17.997 --> 00:16:19.798
Yes, I'm for it!

233
00:16:19.798 --> 00:16:22.935
<i>Yeah, we owe a lot to Kang Soo.</i>

234
00:16:22.935 --> 00:16:24.837
<i>100,000 won wasn't nearly enough.</i>

235
00:16:24.837 --> 00:16:27.506
<i>Yeah, how embarrassing.</i>

236
00:16:27.506 --> 00:16:29.275
<i>So? How much do I need to buy?</i>

237
00:16:29.275 --> 00:16:30.542
<i>I got paid today!</i>

238
00:16:30.542 --> 00:16:31.910
<i>Me too!</i>

239
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.479
<i>- Wow!
- Wow!</i>

240
00:16:33.479 --> 00:16:35.547
<i>No, no. It's from last month.</i>

241

- Oh, come on!</i>

<i>[Daehan Bank]</i>

243
00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:44.790
Look. Your friends said that
they'd invest this much more money.

244
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.792
It's hard to read, isn't it?

245
00:16:46.792 --> 00:16:48.594
I'll read it for you.

246
00:16:48.994 --> 00:16:51.597
It's 357,680,000 won.

247
00:16:54.833 --> 00:16:55.868
Go.

248
00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:57.670
Stop pondering over it.

249
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.738
Everyone is investing their money
because they believe in you.

250
00:16:59.738 --> 00:17:04.476
But if you still won't go back, that'll
be as if you're betraying their trust

251
00:17:04.476 --> 00:17:07.579
and betraying my trust too,
until the very end.

252

Let's go.

253

Fine, do whatever you want.

I'm leaving.

255
00:17:24.763 --> 00:17:27.466
Everyone else is trying so hard
right now to save this company

256
00:17:27.466 --> 00:17:29.368
so I can't be the only one
to sit around and do nothing.

257
00:17:30.135 --> 00:17:32.137
Because I'm an employee
of this company, too.

I promise you that
I'll definitely do it.

Is it okay... for me to sit next to you?

278
00:20:09.328 --> 00:20:10.562
I'm sorry.

279
00:20:12.498 --> 00:20:16.268
But you came.
So it's fine.

280
00:20:18.237 --> 00:20:19.972
I was scared.

281
00:20:21.673 --> 00:20:24.877
I'd never once been afraid of failure.

282
00:20:24.877 --> 00:20:26.912
But this time, I got scared.

283
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.516
I thought that,
if I didn't stop here

284
00:20:30.516 --> 00:20:34.052
it would become bad for everyone
involved because of me.

285
00:20:34.052 --> 00:20:35.921
Like my friends...

286
00:20:37.956 --> 00:20:39.424
and you, too.

287
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.096
Why did you think such a stupid thing?

288
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.200
All I need is for you
to be by my side.

289
00:20:49.501 --> 00:20:51.737
And same goes for your friends, too.

290
00:20:58.577 --> 00:21:00.078
I'm tired.

291
00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:03.782
I didn't get any sleep last night
because of a certain someone.

292
00:21:06.351 --> 00:21:09.388
Yeah, get some sleep.

293
00:21:10.389 --> 00:21:11.924
I won't go anywhere.

294
00:21:34.212 --> 00:21:36.315
Oh, hello!

295
00:21:36.982 --> 00:21:40.919
Wait, why are you here?
What about Kang Soo?

296
00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:45.090
Well, um, he said he had some
business in his hometown.

297
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.291
What about Dan Ah?

298
00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:48.560
Well, the business that needs
taking care of is such a big deal

299
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.796
- so, um, they went together.
- What?

300
00:21:50.796 --> 00:21:54.700
At any rate, I'll take responsibility for
everything around here until they return!

301
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.268
I told you that I don't
like you, didn't I?

302
00:21:56.268 --> 00:21:58.537
Now is really not the time for that.

303
00:21:58.537 --> 00:22:00.272
Why, you little!

304
00:22:01.473 --> 00:22:05.377
Oh, Kang Soo!
Ms. Dan Ah!

305
00:22:08.747 --> 00:22:10.048
Ah, you're here, sir?

306
00:22:10.048 --> 00:22:11.950
We're sorry for being late.

307
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.051
All right.

308
00:22:13.051 --> 00:22:16.254
Did you resolve the issue
you had in your hometown?

309
00:22:16.254 --> 00:22:18.390
Um... yes.

310
00:22:20.058 --> 00:22:21.727
And it was all thanks to Dan Ah.

311
00:22:25.263 --> 00:22:26.398
Let's go upstairs.

312
00:22:43.215 --> 00:22:45.917
I'm sorry for making all of you worry.

313
00:22:47.386 --> 00:22:50.956
<i>Thanks. I was able to come back
thanks to you all.</i>

<i>I'll never forget that.</i>

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.359
<i>I should've done better.</i>

316
00:22:54.359 --> 00:23:00.499
<i>If I had, all the friends I'd started out
with would still be by my side now.</i>

317
00:23:01.566 --> 00:23:03.602
<i>I fell short.</i>

318
00:23:03.602 --> 00:23:07.205
<i>Our company will rise up again
with the money you guys invested.</i>

319
00:23:07.739 --> 00:23:10.208
Now, we won't only
be delivering food

320
00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:12.844
but flowers, laundry, and groceries.

321
00:23:12.844 --> 00:23:15.180
I'm planning to make anyone who
has a product that can be delivered

322
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.682
an affiliate of
Strongest Deliveryman.

323
00:23:16.682 --> 00:23:20.786
But... I'll definitely revitalize
Restaurant Row.

324
00:23:20.786 --> 00:23:22.721
That's enough already, Kang Soo!

325
00:23:22.721 --> 00:23:24.423
Those people betrayed you!

326
00:23:24.423 --> 00:23:27.192
Kang Soo-- um, no, I mean CEO Choi.

327
00:23:27.192 --> 00:23:28.894
This is a livestream.

328
00:23:28.894 --> 00:23:32.764
The investors may be opposed
to this, so please stop.

329
00:23:34.733 --> 00:23:37.536
All right. If all 380 of you
are opposed to this

330
00:23:37.536 --> 00:23:38.870
then I won't do it.

331
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.039
But please don't forget this:

332
00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:42.708
the reason why we first began to fight

333
00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:45.877
was to save a small restaurant
called Hanyang Seolleongtang.

334
00:23:45.877 --> 00:23:50.449
And the reason why we founded an official
business was to protect Restaurant Row.

335
00:23:50.449 --> 00:23:52.484
We didn't start this company
so that we could make money.

336
00:23:52.484 --> 00:23:55.087
It was so that we could help all the
stores along the streets we frequented

337
00:23:55.087 --> 00:23:57.789
while living among them and delivering
for them, and coexist with them happily.

338
00:23:58.724 --> 00:24:02.627
And I, while eating the food that
someone else made for me

339
00:24:02.627 --> 00:24:04.296
realized something else.

340
00:24:04.296 --> 00:24:09.067
It's such a huge joy to be able to
eat a delicious meal with others.

341
00:24:09.067 --> 00:24:11.236
And that's why I can't give up.

342
00:24:11.236 --> 00:24:15.474
Because it's not right for one person
to monopolize all that happiness.

343
00:24:15.474 --> 00:24:19.811
I think that the happiness of the poor
needs to be protected by the poor.

344
00:24:20.278 --> 00:24:21.379
I beg of you all.

345
00:24:21.379 --> 00:24:23.014
Please, put your faith in me
just one more time.

346
00:24:23.014 --> 00:24:24.916
I'll work hard.

347
00:24:26.718 --> 00:24:28.120
Nice, CEO Choi!

348
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.989
Yeah, it seems that our
Kang Soo is really back!

349
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.425
You're the best, CEO Choi!

350
00:24:43.135 --> 00:24:44.503
Sung Jae!

351
00:24:44.503 --> 00:24:45.837
My bad.

352
00:24:46.805 --> 00:24:48.039
Can we be rehired?

353
00:24:52.878 --> 00:24:54.012
Sure.

354
00:25:00.118 --> 00:25:03.655
All right, hurry up and
move it along, you traitors!

355
00:25:03.655 --> 00:25:05.423
Damn it!

356
00:25:05.423 --> 00:25:07.893
- Thanks!
- No problem! Oh, hey, Min Chan.

357
00:25:07.893 --> 00:25:09.861
Isn't this the kind of thing
that Ms. Yeon Ji would like?

358
00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:11.296
She doesn't like red.

359
00:25:11.296 --> 00:25:13.431
How do you know that?

360
00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:17.636
Is there anyone at your company
who has a friendlier face?

361
00:25:19.437 --> 00:25:21.439
Choi Kang Soo has come back.

362
00:25:21.439 --> 00:25:24.376
And Section Chief Kim Sung Jae has
taken all the deliverymen and left

363
00:25:24.376 --> 00:25:26.812
so all of the deliveries from
Jung Family Foods have been halted.

364
00:25:26.812 --> 00:25:28.180
What did you say?

365
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.150
I think we'll have to use Kim Sung Jae
and pressure Choi Kang Soo directly.

366
00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.186
They'll come straight to you now.

367
00:25:34.186 --> 00:25:35.520
Prepare yourself.

368
00:25:37.088 --> 00:25:39.124
I'm prepared to go to jail.

369
00:25:39.724 --> 00:25:41.193
I'll be going now.

370
00:25:45.397 --> 00:25:47.532
That woman is really
a piece of work.

371
00:25:47.532 --> 00:25:49.100
She's so evil.

372
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.003
I think she's behind the domestic
food mixup incident, too.

373
00:25:52.003 --> 00:25:53.038
What?

374
00:25:53.038 --> 00:25:55.607
I checked the CCTV cameras
at Ms. Park's restaurant

375
00:25:55.607 --> 00:25:59.244
and I saw a head manager from Jung
Family approaching her employee.

376
00:25:59.244 --> 00:26:01.179
- Really?
- Yeah.

377
00:26:01.179 --> 00:26:03.481
But that's not enough evidence.

378
00:26:03.481 --> 00:26:05.150
We'll just have to find some more, then.

379
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:06.618
Let's go.

380
00:26:07.719 --> 00:26:09.588
Look over all of the CCTV footage
that covers this street.

381
00:26:09.588 --> 00:26:11.990
And find the people who parked here
overnight, and watch the dashcam footage.

382
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.491
If we just get to the bottom of this

383
00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:15.327
we can get the contract with
Sunjin Construction back, too.

384
00:26:15.327 --> 00:26:17.796
All right.
Okay, Let's go!

385
00:26:28.306 --> 00:26:31.509
I'm shuddering.
How could they stoop this low?

386
00:26:31.509 --> 00:26:33.678
And a person who runs a
restaurant business, of all people?

387
00:26:33.678 --> 00:26:35.647
She's capable of much worse, too.

388
00:26:35.647 --> 00:26:37.849
At any rate, we have evidence now.
Let's go and get them.

389
00:26:37.849 --> 00:26:39.050
Calm yourself.

390
00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.653
If we're hasty, we may end up
being the ones who get hurt.

391
00:26:41.653 --> 00:26:43.188
What are you planning to do, then?

392
00:26:43.188 --> 00:26:44.489
First, let's meet with them.

393
00:26:44.489 --> 00:26:47.692
We need to know what their response
will be to prepare for the next part.

394
00:26:52.697 --> 00:26:54.266
<i>[English-Korean Dictionary]</i>

395
00:26:55.901 --> 00:26:58.637
Do I need to get tutored
in English by Ms. Dan Ah?

396
00:26:58.637 --> 00:27:01.339
No, I bet she'll charge me
a lot of money.

397
00:27:03.008 --> 00:27:04.476
Damn it.

398
00:27:06.378 --> 00:27:07.712
Oh, you're home from work?

399
00:27:09.881 --> 00:27:10.882
What are you doing?

400
00:27:10.882 --> 00:27:12.484
I'm preparing for the
College Scholastic Ability Test.

401
00:27:16.821 --> 00:27:17.923
What?

402
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:23.094
I thought about it, and I think
I need to work with children.

403
00:27:23.094 --> 00:27:24.963
What are you going to do
to those poor children?

404
00:27:27.766 --> 00:27:30.402
Um, okay.
So?

405
00:27:30.402 --> 00:27:33.004
I'm going to apply as an Early
Education major, and study properly.

406
00:27:33.638 --> 00:27:36.741
It was my original goal to become
a fantastic kindergarten teacher.

407
00:27:36.741 --> 00:27:39.144
But I had to give that up
because of my mom

408
00:27:39.144 --> 00:27:40.779
and majored in Business Management.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

409
00:27:42.981 --> 00:27:46.851
Wow, I guess your mom did have plans to
entrust the business to you at one point.

410
00:27:47.485 --> 00:27:49.087
And that's wrong!

411
00:27:49.087 --> 00:27:51.790
I may be her child,
but I'm my own person!

412
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.259
So why does she only keep
considering me as a commodity?

413
00:27:54.259 --> 00:27:56.795
Even if my mom decides later on
to leave me all of her wealth

414
00:27:56.795 --> 00:27:58.396
I'm going to donate it all!

415
00:27:59.364 --> 00:28:01.333
- You mean that?
- Of course.

416
00:28:01.333 --> 00:28:02.701
You swear it?

417
00:28:03.201 --> 00:28:05.737
But you've never been
truly poor yet.

418
00:28:05.737 --> 00:28:10.442
So are you confident that you won't
ask your mom for her money

419
00:28:10.442 --> 00:28:12.677
even if you become so poor that
you'll want to sell your soul?

420
00:28:12.677 --> 00:28:14.245
Of course.

421
00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.315
All right, then.

422
00:28:17.315 --> 00:28:21.419
So, even if your mom happens to lose
everything she has right now...

423
00:28:22.687 --> 00:28:24.189
you wouldn't care?

424
00:28:25.256 --> 00:28:27.325
You said you want to go back to college.

425
00:28:27.926 --> 00:28:31.096
But if you have to give up on college
because you can't afford tuition...

426
00:28:32.464 --> 00:28:34.733
do you think you'd still be
able to say the same thing?

427
00:28:36.334 --> 00:28:38.103
Why are you acting like
this today, Mr. Jin Kyu?

428
00:28:38.103 --> 00:28:39.971
Why are you so insistent on
me being sure of my answer?

429
00:28:39.971 --> 00:28:41.306
You've moved out now.

430
00:28:41.306 --> 00:28:43.842
But if you truly want to be
independent from your parents...

431
00:28:43.842 --> 00:28:46.144
you'll need to be prepared for
at least that much.

432
00:28:46.144 --> 00:28:47.312
Don't worry.

433
00:28:47.312 --> 00:28:50.081
I'll never change my mind about that,
despite my situation.

434
00:28:50.582 --> 00:28:55.520
Did you know that other people don't
even think about these kinds of things?

435
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.391
You and I only worry about these things
because we were born in a rich family.

436
00:28:59.391 --> 00:29:02.427
People who weren't don't even have
fears like these.

437
00:29:02.427 --> 00:29:04.929
They don't expect to depend on
their parents to begin with.

438
00:29:05.397 --> 00:29:08.767
They live with much more independence
than people like us.

439
00:29:10.168 --> 00:29:11.269
I see.

440
00:29:13.872 --> 00:29:15.173
Who is it?

441
00:29:24.416 --> 00:29:25.550
Who are you?

442
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.189
M... Mom.

443
00:29:31.456 --> 00:29:33.224
I heard from your mom.

444
00:29:33.591 --> 00:29:36.127
You've been learning business
management from Jung Family.

445
00:29:36.127 --> 00:29:39.064
No, there was nothing to learn
from that place.

446
00:29:39.898 --> 00:29:42.667
Oh my! Why do you speak like that?

447
00:29:42.667 --> 00:29:44.035
Leave him be.

448
00:29:44.035 --> 00:29:46.538
This is what suits him.

449
00:29:48.473 --> 00:29:50.041
I'll get to the point.

450
00:29:50.875 --> 00:29:52.377
Come back home.

451
00:29:52.744 --> 00:29:55.780
Come back and take over
Ohsung Construction.

452
00:29:57.048 --> 00:29:58.850
Put your skills to work.

453
00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:02.053
Why are you suddenly acting this
way to me?

454
00:30:04.522 --> 00:30:07.125
You are my bloodline.

455
00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:09.627
That is why I'm giving you
one more opportunity.

456
00:30:09.627 --> 00:30:13.198
Live an honorable life
as Ohsung's second son.

457
00:30:16.034 --> 00:30:17.368
What are you doing?

458
00:30:17.368 --> 00:30:20.038
Hurry up and thank him.

459
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:24.943
Jin Kyu!

460
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:27.512
I'm sorry.

461
00:30:28.813 --> 00:30:31.983
Ohsung's second son died
a long time ago.

462
00:30:32.283 --> 00:30:33.351
Hey.

463
00:30:38.723 --> 00:30:41.759
Goodbye. I'll get going now.

464
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:53.738
<i>Jung Family's branch manager came to me
and told me to do it.</i>

465
00:30:53.738 --> 00:30:57.675
<i>I never imagined
things would get this big.</i>

466
00:30:58.576 --> 00:31:03.081
<i>I never dreamed that I'd cause all the
restaurants on the street to close down.</i>

467
00:31:03.915 --> 00:31:06.684
Go to Sunjin Construction and
tell them the truth.

468
00:31:06.684 --> 00:31:08.553
Resolve this issue today.

469
00:31:08.553 --> 00:31:12.257
Otherwise, I'll formally request an
investigation by the police.

470
00:31:15.059 --> 00:31:16.995
Why are you saying this to me?

471
00:31:16.995 --> 00:31:18.196
Excuse me?

472
00:31:19.497 --> 00:31:22.367
Branch Manager Song,
what are you doing?

473
00:31:23.001 --> 00:31:25.570
- What?
- Who told you to show loyalty like this?

474
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:26.738
CEO Jung.

475
00:31:29.507 --> 00:31:32.777
Go to the police.
I know nothing about this.

476
00:31:33.111 --> 00:31:36.915
An employee set on promotion
went went rogue.

477
00:31:37.415 --> 00:31:38.449
What did you say?

478
00:31:38.449 --> 00:31:39.817
You are fired.

479
00:31:40.418 --> 00:31:44.055
I'll be making a claim for the damage
you've done Jung Family's image.

480
00:31:44.055 --> 00:31:45.156
Be prepared for that.

481
00:31:45.156 --> 00:31:46.257
CEO Jung...

482
00:31:47.392 --> 00:31:49.127
Why don't you all leave now?

483
00:32:00.038 --> 00:32:01.172
Are you okay?

484
00:32:03.441 --> 00:32:06.077
No... I'm angry.

485
00:32:06.077 --> 00:32:07.712
She ordered you to do it,
didn't she?

486
00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:10.648
- Yes.
- Then can you come with me?

487
00:32:11.849 --> 00:32:13.618
- Where?
- Sunjin Construction.

488
00:32:13.618 --> 00:32:16.754
Please just tell them the truth
and we won't need to go to the police.

489
00:32:17.388 --> 00:32:18.690
What do you mean by that?

490
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.759
I didn't start this to put weak people
like you in jail.

491
00:32:21.759 --> 00:32:24.229
So, just go and tell them the truth.

492
00:32:24.229 --> 00:32:25.530
That's all I need.

493
00:32:29.968 --> 00:32:33.738
I was ordered to by the CEO
of Jung Family, so I carried it out.

494
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.942
That doesn't mean
I can break the contract again.

495
00:32:37.942 --> 00:32:39.744
What do you mean by that?

496
00:32:40.612 --> 00:32:44.382
Because of that incident,
innocent restaurants are closing.

497
00:32:44.382 --> 00:32:46.918
Let's not talk about it any further.

498
00:32:46.918 --> 00:32:49.487
Honestly, this is nothing but a tip.

499
00:32:49.487 --> 00:32:52.490
There is no formal investigation.

500
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.760
I can't complicate procedures with
something like this again.

501
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.664
Because you don't want complications,
you're going to ignore it?

502
00:32:59.664 --> 00:33:02.200
Please leave. I have a meeting.

503
00:33:12.143 --> 00:33:13.311
I'm sorry.

504
00:33:14.812 --> 00:33:17.615
Can I leave now like you promised?

505
00:33:17.615 --> 00:33:20.051
Yes. Thank you.

506
00:33:22.787 --> 00:33:24.055
Hold on!

507
00:33:24.489 --> 00:33:27.058
If there's anything I don't know,
please let me know.

508
00:33:27.058 --> 00:33:28.626
Don't take the blame by yourself.

509
00:33:28.626 --> 00:33:30.295
Then these things will never stop.

510
00:33:30.295 --> 00:33:33.498
People without strength need to join
forces to stop them from happening.

511
00:33:36.267 --> 00:33:37.502
I'm asking you, please!

512
00:33:38.469 --> 00:33:39.737
Just once...

513
00:33:41.339 --> 00:33:42.807
be courageous.

514
00:33:48.946 --> 00:33:52.850
This world... it's always those awful
people who live well.

515
00:33:54.185 --> 00:33:55.386
What will you do now?

516
00:33:55.386 --> 00:33:56.654
I have to keep fighting.

517
00:33:56.654 --> 00:33:58.022
I'll make sure they get punished.

518
00:33:58.022 --> 00:34:00.158
Your will isn't always enough.

519
00:34:00.158 --> 00:34:04.595
It's not the law but money that you
need to cut off for business people.

520
00:34:04.595 --> 00:34:07.799
Or you could just grab them by the
throat and shake them...

521
00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:08.933
Soon Ae.

522
00:34:09.634 --> 00:34:12.203
All right, we don't have to do it.

523
00:34:13.271 --> 00:34:15.139
You're acting like some older brother
lately.

524
00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:16.908
- I am older than you.
- What?

525
00:34:17.208 --> 00:34:18.976
Seriously, this guy...

526
00:34:22.413 --> 00:34:24.115
Don't get food on your mouth.

527
00:34:32.557 --> 00:34:34.392
<i>[CEO Moon]</i>

528
00:34:40.765 --> 00:34:42.066
Hello.

529
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:46.838
What... what did you say?

530
00:34:46.838 --> 00:34:48.272
<i>I caught that punk.</i>

531
00:34:48.272 --> 00:34:51.376
<i>After I met you that day,
I got my guys to find him.</i>

532
00:34:51.376 --> 00:34:54.679
<i>What should I do?
Should I punish him for you?</i>

533
00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:57.014
No, please leave it to me.

534
00:34:57.515 --> 00:34:59.851
<i>Okay. Call me.</i>

535
00:34:59.851 --> 00:35:02.920
Yes. Thank you, Mister.

536
00:35:03.688 --> 00:35:05.289
Thank you so much.

537
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.799
- What's going on?
- He caught that punk.

538
00:35:17.468 --> 00:35:19.103
He's finally been caught.

539
00:35:28.646 --> 00:35:31.082
I can't forget the branch manager's face.

540
00:35:31.082 --> 00:35:35.153
When she realized CEO Jung was
framing her for everything...

541
00:35:35.586 --> 00:35:37.422
she looked so miserable.

542
00:35:38.423 --> 00:35:40.224
Yes, I'm sure she feels so wronged.

543
00:35:40.224 --> 00:35:44.695
When poor people feel used by the rich,
they feel especially low.

544
00:35:44.695 --> 00:35:46.330
There's no way to get revenge.

545
00:35:47.498 --> 00:35:49.867
That's why you need to do well, CEO Choi.

546
00:35:49.867 --> 00:35:53.704
You need to succeed in order to change
this world.

547
00:35:54.572 --> 00:35:57.975
When I'm talking to you,
I feel like I've become a hero.

548
00:35:57.975 --> 00:35:59.811
You're a hero to me.

549
00:36:00.144 --> 00:36:02.413
My hero. You're the best, Sweetie.

550
00:36:08.686 --> 00:36:12.423
By the way, I noticed you ate all
of that seafood stew.

551
00:36:12.423 --> 00:36:13.891
- Was it edible?
- Yes.

552
00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:17.061
It was good except for the sand
that got in my teeth.

553
00:36:17.562 --> 00:36:21.265
You're supposed to let clams sit in
water for an hour to let the sand out.

554
00:36:21.265 --> 00:36:23.067
Then why did you eat it all?

555
00:36:23.067 --> 00:36:25.102
You said it cost a lot and
I should eat it all.

556
00:36:25.436 --> 00:36:26.804
Oh, are you serious?

557
00:36:26.804 --> 00:36:28.973
It was good.
I ate it all because it was good.

558
00:36:30.708 --> 00:36:32.310
I don't want you to go.

559
00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.345
I don't want to be apart.

560
00:36:34.345 --> 00:36:35.546
Oh, really?

561
00:36:35.546 --> 00:36:39.317
Is that why you disappeared
leaving just a note?

562
00:36:40.084 --> 00:36:41.319
Sorry.

563
00:36:43.354 --> 00:36:46.457
Dan Ah, where is your hometown anyway?

564
00:36:46.457 --> 00:36:48.759
- It's close to yours.
- What?

565
00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:53.030
It's one of the stations we passed
while coming back on the train.

566
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.966
Why did you just pass by?

567
00:36:55.433 --> 00:36:57.001
You should've stopped by.

568
00:36:59.337 --> 00:37:00.972
Aren't you curious about your family?

569
00:37:03.674 --> 00:37:06.844
If they don't call,
that means nothing much is going on.

570
00:37:07.545 --> 00:37:09.080
That's how I live.

571
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.147
Why?

572
00:37:11.716 --> 00:37:16.454
I just... feel too busy living
my own life for now.

573
00:37:17.855 --> 00:37:20.892
I don't have enough happiness to share
with my family.

574
00:37:24.195 --> 00:37:26.430
- Kang Soo.
- Yes?

575
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.833
She came by.

576
00:37:29.233 --> 00:37:31.435
- What?
- Hyun Soo's mother.

577
00:37:32.036 --> 00:37:35.473
She came by to see you secretly,
but ran into me.

578
00:37:35.473 --> 00:37:37.241
She said she was worried about you.

579
00:37:38.042 --> 00:37:42.079
I don't really want to hear about that.

580
00:37:43.881 --> 00:37:45.816
All right. I'm sorry.

581
00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:49.020
But, you should know.

582
00:37:50.788 --> 00:37:54.825
No matter what, coming to
your hometown...

583
00:37:54.825 --> 00:37:57.028
would have required a lot of courage
from her.

584
00:37:57.895 --> 00:37:59.030
That's enough.

585
00:38:00.364 --> 00:38:03.801
Okay... I'll stop.

586
00:38:06.737 --> 00:38:07.939
I'll get going.

587
00:38:08.873 --> 00:38:10.041
Sleep well.

588
00:38:11.576 --> 00:38:14.445
Okay, get home safely.

589
00:38:23.521 --> 00:38:25.456
- Sleep.
- Okay.

590
00:38:44.275 --> 00:38:45.409
Are you drunk?

591
00:38:46.844 --> 00:38:47.878
Yes.

592
00:38:47.878 --> 00:38:49.480
Why did you drink so much?

593
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.449
- A farewell drink.
- What?

594
00:38:53.517 --> 00:38:55.653
- I quit.
- Why?

595
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.023
Why? I don't know.

596
00:39:02.793 --> 00:39:09.066
Oh yeah. When a writer pays taxes,
do you know what they call it?

597
00:39:09.066 --> 00:39:12.269
Uh... what is it?

598
00:39:12.269 --> 00:39:14.905
Word taxes...

599
00:39:17.174 --> 00:39:18.275
I'm sorry.

600
00:39:23.114 --> 00:39:26.183
What's with you? You're a beat behind.

601
00:39:26.183 --> 00:39:27.852
- Oh...
- Why are you hitting me?

602
00:39:28.152 --> 00:39:30.688
You want to fight me? I'm a good fighter.

603
00:39:30.688 --> 00:39:33.257
It's been a long time...
the two of them.

604
00:39:33.257 --> 00:39:34.925
Then why didn't you say anything?

605
00:39:36.394 --> 00:39:37.728
Because you might get hurt.

606
00:39:40.531 --> 00:39:41.632
I see.

607
00:39:42.967 --> 00:39:44.201
Thanks.

608
00:40:04.755 --> 00:40:07.792
Okay. I will step aside.

609
00:40:10.461 --> 00:40:12.063
Be happy, Min Chan.

610
00:40:31.348 --> 00:40:32.416
It's up.

611
00:40:32.883 --> 00:40:35.720
It's up. Guys, it's up!

612
00:40:40.758 --> 00:40:42.760
What's with the commotion outside?

613
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.961
Is something going on?

614
00:40:44.495 --> 00:40:46.230
Just a moment...

615
00:40:46.797 --> 00:40:48.399
I think you should watch the news.

616
00:40:48.866 --> 00:40:50.000

It's not only this street.

636
00:42:25.529 --> 00:42:28.465
All of the Jung Family businesses
are suffering.

637
00:42:28.465 --> 00:42:30.100
Get Youngil Savings Bank on the phone.

638
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:41.712
I have the guy who faked an adultery
case under your orders.

639
00:42:41.712 --> 00:42:44.248
CEO Moon found him for me.

640
00:42:45.449 --> 00:42:47.051
- CEO Moon?
- Yes.

641
00:42:47.051 --> 00:42:49.653
You know how scary he is when he's
angry, don't you?

642
00:42:49.653 --> 00:42:51.856
- Oh, Soon Ae...
- Hey.

643
00:42:52.523 --> 00:42:54.358
This guy here is saying my name.

644
00:42:54.358 --> 00:42:55.559
Shut your jaw.

645
00:42:57.494 --> 00:42:58.729
Make a choice.

646
00:42:58.729 --> 00:43:00.998
You want to go to jail and become
an ex-convict dad?

647
00:43:00.998 --> 00:43:03.701
Or do you want to give me back
my father's money?

648
00:43:06.237 --> 00:43:10.674
There's a line of people waiting to
harass you in jail, just so you know.

649
00:43:10.674 --> 00:43:13.577
CEO Moon has a lot of connections there.

650
00:43:17.481 --> 00:43:19.717
Oh, please let me live.

651
00:43:19.717 --> 00:43:23.487
I'll get my shares and return everything
I took from you then.

652
00:43:24.388 --> 00:43:26.090
- Give me one month.
- You have ten days.

653
00:43:28.659 --> 00:43:30.027
Let's go, Sweetie.

654
00:43:45.175 --> 00:43:48.212
Please lend me an additional
12 billion won.

655
00:43:48.212 --> 00:43:49.813
You can set the interest as you like.

656
00:43:49.813 --> 00:43:53.117
Sorry, but more loans will be difficult.

657
00:43:53.117 --> 00:43:56.053
- Sir.
- <i>You have to pay principal this month.</i>

658
00:43:56.053 --> 00:43:59.056
If you are behind even one day,
we'll have to seize your assets.

659
00:43:59.056 --> 00:44:01.158
- Wait.
- I'm hanging up now.

660
00:44:05.129 --> 00:44:08.265
All the restaurants are in surplus by,
at least, 10 million won.

661
00:44:08.265 --> 00:44:11.702
And we have a revenue of 62 million won.

662
00:44:11.702 --> 00:44:13.304
Wow!

663
00:44:13.304 --> 00:44:14.872
Our profit is 27 million won.

664
00:44:14.872 --> 00:44:16.106
Wow!

665
00:44:17.441 --> 00:44:20.778
Everyone will get a performance bonus
of 1 million won each.

666
00:44:20.778 --> 00:44:22.947
Wow!

667
00:44:22.947 --> 00:44:25.549
Thank you. You all worked hard.

668
00:44:26.951 --> 00:44:28.218
Kang Soo!

669
00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.587
Hyun Soo.

670
00:44:31.322 --> 00:44:32.389
Kang Soo.

671
00:44:32.923 --> 00:44:34.758
My real brother.

672
00:44:39.296 --> 00:44:40.798
It's me, Hyun Soo.

673
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.435
Your little brother.

674
00:44:46.603 --> 00:44:47.838
Hyun Soo!

675
00:44:58.782 --> 00:45:00.651
I think he knows everything.

676
00:45:02.786 --> 00:45:04.722
I think she told him everything.

677
00:45:21.538 --> 00:45:22.673
Kang Soo...

678
00:45:23.841 --> 00:45:25.042
Kang Soo...

679
00:45:26.643 --> 00:45:27.878
Kang Soo...

680
00:45:40.824 --> 00:45:44.528
Has... Hyun Soo come here?

681
00:45:47.831 --> 00:45:50.167
I told you not to tell him.

682
00:45:50.501 --> 00:45:52.469
I warned you, didn't I?

683
00:45:52.469 --> 00:45:54.605
I had no choice.

684
00:45:55.806 --> 00:45:57.441
You had no choice?

685
00:45:58.042 --> 00:46:01.211
Why do you have to make Hyun Soo
miserable too? Why!

686
00:46:02.279 --> 00:46:04.148
My dad and me...

687
00:46:05.215 --> 00:46:07.351
We were both sick because of you.

688
00:46:08.485 --> 00:46:12.556
Now, you're even going to do that
to Hyun Soo!

689
00:46:14.625 --> 00:46:16.160
I am sorry.

690
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:19.229
I was wrong.

691
00:46:20.264 --> 00:46:21.398
Sorry?

692
00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.168
You're saying that now?

693
00:46:24.701 --> 00:46:25.769
I'm sorry.

694
00:46:27.504 --> 00:46:29.006
I was wrong.

695
00:46:34.745 --> 00:46:36.680
Why in the world did you do it?

696
00:46:40.084 --> 00:46:42.586
Why did you do that to Dad?

697
00:46:43.887 --> 00:46:45.189
Because he was nice.

698
00:46:46.457 --> 00:46:47.524
What?

699
00:46:47.791 --> 00:46:49.226
Because he was so darn nice.

700
00:46:50.794 --> 00:46:53.664
I did it because he seemed easy to fool.

701
00:46:54.531 --> 00:46:55.766
The debts...

702
00:46:57.401 --> 00:46:59.570
I had so much debt.

703
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:03.974
I was on the run here and there
with my younger siblings.

704
00:47:04.708 --> 00:47:07.077
Then I met your father.

705
00:47:07.544 --> 00:47:10.147
I was going to take all his money.

706
00:47:10.581 --> 00:47:12.649
Then run away quickly.

707
00:47:14.651 --> 00:47:15.752
Stop.

708
00:47:15.752 --> 00:47:18.956
But... it was hard.

709
00:47:19.423 --> 00:47:23.393
I was reluctant and ended up having you.

710
00:47:23.727 --> 00:47:27.231
But, the debt-collectors came
after me again.

711
00:47:27.231 --> 00:47:30.267
I left your father and ran.

712
00:47:32.436 --> 00:47:33.937
I left you behind too.

713
00:47:35.606 --> 00:47:36.840
I ran away.

714
00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:41.411
If you were by my side,
you'd be on the run forever.

715
00:47:43.647 --> 00:47:45.415
I'm sorry, Kang Soo.

716
00:47:48.152 --> 00:47:51.922
Kang Soo, don't forgive me.

717
00:47:52.389 --> 00:47:56.527
Even... until I die...

718
00:47:58.428 --> 00:47:59.763
don't forgive me.

719
00:48:03.033 --> 00:48:04.234
Okay?

720
00:49:32.256 --> 00:49:33.290
Kang Soo.

721
00:49:38.295 --> 00:49:39.429
Did you sleep well?

722
00:49:39.796 --> 00:49:40.831
Yes.

723
00:49:40.831 --> 00:49:42.633
Why did you drink so much?

724
00:49:42.633 --> 00:49:43.667
Just because.

725
00:49:45.702 --> 00:49:47.070
Is something wrong?

726
00:49:47.638 --> 00:49:49.940
- Nothing really.
- Don't drink so much.

727
00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.174
You're an adult now too.

728
00:49:51.174 --> 00:49:53.343
If you ever drink that much again...

729
00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:55.979
you'll get in big trouble with me.

730
00:49:55.979 --> 00:49:57.080
Kang Soo...

731
00:50:12.195 --> 00:50:13.430
Kang Soo!

732
00:50:14.998 --> 00:50:18.368
We won. We've won!

735
00:50:32.249 --> 00:50:34.384
We won!

- Victory!

737
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:42.225
Hyun Soo, call your grandmother.

738
00:50:42.225 --> 00:50:43.694
Tell her to come to Hanyang.

739
00:50:45.028 --> 00:50:46.396
You're the best, CEO.

740
00:50:55.772 --> 00:50:57.674
- Hey.
- Let's lift him up.

741
00:50:59.343 --> 00:51:01.044
One, two, three!

742
00:51:02.045 --> 00:51:03.980
One, two, three!

743
00:51:26.937 --> 00:51:28.038
Mom.

744
00:51:29.473 --> 00:51:30.574
You're here?

745
00:51:31.174 --> 00:51:32.175
Yes.

746
00:51:35.212 --> 00:51:36.880
Mom, let's go now.

747
00:51:44.121 --> 00:51:45.489
Let's get going now.

748
00:51:46.289 --> 00:51:47.858
You can start over.

749
00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.995
You're good at cooking.

750
00:51:52.896 --> 00:51:57.768
I... like your food more than anything.

751
00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:07.677
All right.

752
00:52:09.079 --> 00:52:10.213
Let's go.

753
00:52:40.043 --> 00:52:41.344
I will drive.

754
00:52:41.344 --> 00:52:43.580
Oh, would you?

755
00:52:58.328 --> 00:53:00.163
- Dan Ah.
- Yes?

756
00:53:01.131 --> 00:53:02.466
I did good, right?

757
00:53:02.466 --> 00:53:03.500
Yes.

758
00:53:05.969 --> 00:53:07.871
- Dan Ah.
- Yes?

759
00:53:09.506 --> 00:53:11.107
You want to eat black bean noodles?

760
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:14.611
Yes.

761
00:53:15.645 --> 00:53:17.414
- I'll make it really good.
- Okay.

762
00:53:19.149 --> 00:53:20.484
- Kang Soo.
- Yeah?

763
00:53:20.484 --> 00:53:22.486
Should I fry onions for you?

764
00:53:22.486 --> 00:53:25.255
Yes! Make me fried onions.

765
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:30.894
Hey, rinse the bubbles properly,
would you?

766
00:53:30.894 --> 00:53:34.598
I did. You need to rinse it better.

767
00:53:34.598 --> 00:53:36.533
What do you mean?
I'm doing a great job.

768
00:53:36.533 --> 00:53:38.034
Look, it's still there.

769
00:53:38.034 --> 00:53:40.136
You should wash that.
What in the world...

770
00:53:40.136 --> 00:53:42.305
You need to put the bubbles on,
so that I can wash it.

771
00:53:42.305 --> 00:53:43.640
What did I do wrong? What, what?

772
00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.841
Ouch, ouch!

773
00:53:44.841 --> 00:53:46.643
You talk back to me a lot now.

774
00:53:46.643 --> 00:53:49.179
You always resort to hitting first.

775
00:53:49.179 --> 00:53:50.780
You want to get hit again?

776
00:53:52.148 --> 00:53:53.650
You're asking to get hit.

777
00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:55.418
I was wondering why you weren't
hitting me.

778

<i>[Epilogue]</i>

779
00:54:04.794 --> 00:54:06.162
Hello.

780
00:54:08.265 --> 00:54:09.399
Here you go.

781
00:54:10.033 --> 00:54:12.335
- Bye. Get home safely.
- Okay.

782
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:14.437
So cute.

783
00:54:14.838 --> 00:54:16.406
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

784
00:54:21.444 --> 00:54:22.579
You're tired, right?

785
00:54:23.079 --> 00:54:27.417
No, when I see angelic kids like that,
I get even stronger.

786
00:54:27.417 --> 00:54:28.952
Isn't that comment too official?

787
00:54:28.952 --> 00:54:30.120
Is it obvious?

788
00:54:30.587 --> 00:54:33.089
Gosh, they really don't listen at all.

789
00:54:33.089 --> 00:54:35.025
Then you're a bad teacher.

790
00:54:35.025 --> 00:54:36.092
Keep my secret.

791
00:54:36.092 --> 00:54:37.494
I'll see based on how you behave.

792
00:54:38.295 --> 00:54:40.163
- Jin Kyu.
- What is it?

793
00:54:41.064 --> 00:54:42.299
Do you have regrets?

794
00:54:45.001 --> 00:54:47.437
- What about you?
- I'm fine for now.

795
00:54:47.437 --> 00:54:48.605
Me too.

796
00:54:59.749 --> 00:55:00.917
Thank you for the meal.

797
00:55:00.917 --> 00:55:02.986
Come whenever you're hungry.
Come often.

798
00:55:02.986 --> 00:55:04.220
Yes, I will.

799
00:55:05.288 --> 00:55:07.524
- Go on in.
- Okay. Bye.

800
00:55:16.032 --> 00:55:19.336
Have you... eaten?

801
00:55:19.336 --> 00:55:20.403
Yes.

802
00:55:21.237 --> 00:55:23.940
Okay, bye then.

803
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:24.975
Okay.

804
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.144
Wait.

805
00:55:41.658 --> 00:55:42.726
Go on now.

806
00:55:53.303 --> 00:55:54.871
I'm really going to risk it all.

807
00:55:54.871 --> 00:55:56.306
She's totally my ideal woman.

808
00:55:56.806 --> 00:55:59.643
You will become my girlfriend today.

809
00:56:00.043 --> 00:56:01.277
Don't get hurt later on.

810
00:56:02.312 --> 00:56:03.580
She's coming now.

811
00:56:06.416 --> 00:56:08.518
- What now?
- Please just give us 30 minutes.

812
00:56:08.518 --> 00:56:10.453
I have no interest in kids.

813
00:56:10.453 --> 00:56:11.988
Then what style of guy do you like?

814
00:56:11.988 --> 00:56:13.223
I'll develop into that type.

815
00:56:13.223 --> 00:56:14.491
Oh, seriously!

816
00:56:16.693 --> 00:56:19.829
Him. I like guys just like that.

817
00:56:20.163 --> 00:56:21.197
Got it?

818
00:56:30.373 --> 00:56:32.142
- Who are they?
- My fans.

819
00:56:32.142 --> 00:56:33.476
Can I chase them away?

820
00:56:55.098 --> 00:57:05.108
