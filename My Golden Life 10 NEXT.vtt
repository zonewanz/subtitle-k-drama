00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:12.150
Seo Ji An.

4
00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.560
(Episode 10)

5
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.499
Are you brave or stupid?

6
00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.499
You can't even walk out the gate...

7
00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.170
because you don't know how to unlock security,

8
00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.899
but why don't you think the wall will be the same?

9
00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:36.370
I didn't know there's an alarm on the wall.

10
00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:39.509
Then why do you think that's up there?

11
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.779
Average people don't have them at their houses.

12
00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.350
They don't have anything to steal or protect.

13
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.149
Your hidden temper is coming back out.

14
00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.190
- Stop it. - Stop what?

15
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.660
I know how much you hate and despise me,

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.459
find me ridiculous and annoying,

17
00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:57.130
and you think of me as a rat or beggar,

18
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.560
but don't be sarcastic at least today.

19
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.770
If you're going to see your boyfriend, go back,

20
00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.000
but if you want a drink, follow me.

21
00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:11.080
- Pardon? - I unlocked the security.

22
00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:12.179
Follow me.

23
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.380
Why are you doing this? Leave me alone.

24
00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.479
What if our parents find that you went out alone?

25
00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:20.050
I don't even want to imagine it.

26
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.690
I'm giving you an alibi.

27
00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:25.959
An alibi?

28
00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.130
Why... Why would you?

29
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.559
Here.

30
00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:36.229
Oh, it's Ji Soo.

31
00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.869
Where... Where did you find this?

32
00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.640
Isn't that why you're climbing over the wall...

33
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.740
at such a late hour?

34
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780
Forget about the other stuff.

35
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.979
You can't bring back what went into the trash can...

36
00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:52.679
due to Mother's order.

37
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.419
Did you...

38
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.319
take this out from the trash?

39
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.490
I can buy you a better one for everything else,

40
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.660
but that seemed different.

41
00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:06.899
I thought it means a lot...

42
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.630
to you.

43
00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:15.654
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

44
00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:20.539
Why would you do that?

45
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.449
Give it to me. You said...

46
00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:26.850
you'll let me do whatever I want to do.

47
00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.850
You didn't even clean it.

48
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.220
There is a difference in the details.

49
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.919
Details. Details.

50
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.030
It'll take more than 10 years to teach you.

51
00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.729
Slow down.

52
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.199
I won't tolerate drinking habits.

53
00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.180
First, I now know that you were serious...

54
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.479
when you said you repent.

55
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.479
Second, I know you're trying your best.

56
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.680
Even though you made more mistakes than you tried.

57
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.220
Anyway, third, I looked back...

58
00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.120
at the prejudice or misunderstanding I had.

59
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.359
Fourth, so I should accept you as my sister.

60
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.530
I didn't want my sister to be discouraged in any way.

61
00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.500
You don't trust me, do you?

62
00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.799
Don't show your feelings.

63
00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.470
Maintain your dignity.

64
00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.310
How did you know...

65
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.940
you have a prejudice or misunderstanding...

66
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.079
towards me?

67
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.009
How dare she ask to be called as Seo Ji An?

68
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.049
How dare she say that?

69
00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.250
Where does she think she is?

70
00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.460
That's why you threw out all her stuff.

71
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.630
Mr. Yang said she's picking up pretty fast.

72
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.829
She refunded all the gifts for her other family.

73
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.130
I thought she was adjusting.

74
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.100
She refunded the gifts?

75
00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.739
That didn't mean she's adjusting here,

76
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.710
but she was going against me.

77
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.639
I'm sure that's not true.

78
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.910
Anyway, we need to control her from now on...

79
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.850
Honey.

80
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.449
You're home, Father.

81
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.489
It seemed you were having an important conversation.

82
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.759
General Manager Min didn't say you were home.

83
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.389
It's already past midnight.

84
00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.729
I'll go now. Goodnight.

85
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.479
You got the necklace back from Seo Hyun.

86
00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:39.580
You refunded the gifts for your old family.

87
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.119
And you endured even though I was mean to you.

88
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.390
You said you're sorry and accepted my complaints.

89
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.629
You really meant it when you said sorry.

90
00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:49.359
Shouldn't I trust you too?

91
00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.200
I see.

92
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.499
Pay back 20,000 dollars to Mother.

93
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.970
Only then would you be confident again.

94
00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:01.010
You knew it was from Mother?

95
00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:02.669
I found out later.

96
00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.210
Nothing's free in this world.

97
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.749
No matter how small the prejudice is,

98
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.850
it might cause a big discrepancy in the future.

99
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.220
I don't know what I should...

100
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.749
tell Mom if I were to return the money.

101
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.119
I told her that I had debts.

102
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.890
You're right.

103
00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.160
Can I tell her about the car accident?

104
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.059
No, no.

105
00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:25.200
It was lucky it was you.

106
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.059
She'll say my generous actions were for nothing.

107
00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.999
When she finds out I was involved in this,

108
00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:31.400
I'll be in trouble for not behaving more carefully.

109
00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:34.439
Then what do I do with the 20,000 dollars?

110
00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:35.640
Well...

111
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.739
You really don't have any debts?

112
00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:40.580
I have a student loan to pay back.

113
00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:43.150
Then use the money to pay that back.

114
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.720
But I will still have money left after that.

115
00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.919
Really? If you have money left,

116
00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.249
then you should use it.

117
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.820
Are you...

118
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.129
making me lie?

119
00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:56.359
That's demeaning my dignity.

120
00:05:56.359 --> 00:05:57.400
What?

121
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.900
No, this is all for your sake.

122
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.770
Think about your behavior...

123
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.239
and actions during this incident.

124
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.970
Remind yourself...

125
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.770
about how headstrong and stubborn you were.

126
00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.410
When she hears what happened because of that,

127
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.179
I bet Mom will triple your training.

128
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.479
You won't be able to catch your breath even.

129
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.789
Fine.

130
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.090
There must be a price for making a deal.

131
00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:26.189
In exchange of your silence,

132
00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:28.760
tell me just one thing that you want from me.

133
00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:36.600
Honey, are you not going to sleep?

134
00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:38.840
Go ahead, and sleep first.

135
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.210
What's gotten into you now?

136
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.309
I only told you to sleep before me.

137
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:48.749
You're angry because I was harsh on Eun Seok.

138
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.989
She spent too much time with that poor family.

139
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.549
When we first met,

140
00:06:57.359 --> 00:06:59.890
you saw how she ate before her elders.

141
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.859
I must be harsh to fix the root of the problem.

142
00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:04.429
I must be strict with her.

143
00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:06.260
But that's not Eun Seok's fault.

144
00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:08.970
It's not her fault...

145
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.470
that she's struggling to adjust into our family.

146
00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:13.900
Do you have the right to scold her like that?

147
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.950
Eun Seok is my daughter too.

148
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.749
I knew you would think this way.

149
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.090
You blamed me for all your life.

150
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.330
You blamed me and hated me...

151
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.530
for losing our daughter.

152
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.330
But you couldn't leave me despite your hatred.

153
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.869
My daughter became inadequate because of me.

154
00:07:48.609 --> 00:07:50.369
I'm going to present her...

155
00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:52.410
as the eldest daughter of Haesung...

156
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.249
like she has always been from her birth,

157
00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:56.350
and no one will even think about our lost 25 years.

158
00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.220
Mark my words.

159
00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:12.900
You're conflicted to give up your old family or not.

160
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.629
Don't let that consume you,

161
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.169
but take a step back...

162
00:08:18.369 --> 00:08:19.570
and think about your feelings.

163
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.109
And then make your decision.

164
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.739
Think about from whom you'll benefit.

165
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.410
I didn't choose to be conflicted,

166
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.549
but became conflicted.

167
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.220
No.

168
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.290
You choose to be so.

169
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.989
Do you know why?

170
00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.619
Most people...

171
00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:39.590
are conflicted even if they know the answer.

172
00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.830
"Is this better?" "Or will that be better?"

173
00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:45.060
"Should I do this or that?"

174
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.029
That's not being conflicted. It's greed.

175
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.369
I'm sure you might want...

176
00:08:50.369 --> 00:08:52.399
a part of something you must dispose of.

177
00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:57.609
Even if you know that you can't have it all.

178
00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:06.379
But it seems my sister isn't polite at all.

179
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.489
- Sorry? - Look.

180
00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:11.060
Look here. You got your precious belonging back.

181
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560
I see.

182
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.600
Thank you for finding this for me.

183
00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:22.300
Let me know when you can't handle it anymore.

184
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.600
But you can't whine.

185
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.899
Tell me when it's really hard.

186
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.609
Address me as your brother...

187
00:09:30.609 --> 00:09:31.779
when you're ready.

188
00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:34.210
Until then, I'll let you skip the title.

189
00:09:59.369 --> 00:10:02.710
I thought I was going to lose everyone else.

190
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.950
He should've told me if he put them in my room.

191
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.649
I gave you back your memories...

192
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.619
because memories are precious.

193
00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:29.369
I'm sorry, Mom and Dad.

194
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.300
I'm sorry, Ji Tae.

195
00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:34.409
I'm sorry, Ji Soo.

196
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.139
I'm sorry, Ji Ho.

197
00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:38.680
I'll...

198
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:41.779
get used to this family first...

199
00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:43.779
as a good daughter of my new parents.

200
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.119
After that, I'll place you on the table again.

201
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.769
Mom, what happened to me yesterday?

202
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.470
Drink this.

203
00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:07.540
That's what I want to ask you.

204
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.269
What on earth happened? Ji An brought you home.

205
00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:13.540
Ji An brought me home?

206
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.379
No way, Mom.

207
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.879
She told me that you and she talked on the phone.

208
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.050
What?

209
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.019
There's no way I would have talked to her.

210
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.119
Who is this?

211
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:30.830
Ji Soo. What... What happened to your voice?

212
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:33.859
Ji An.

213
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.600
Oh, that...

214
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.499
I only answered the call because she called me.

215
00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:42.109
I didn't call her.

216
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.409
Besides, she didn't change her number on purpose.

217
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.989
Hello?

218
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.320
Hold on.

219
00:12:05.229 --> 00:12:07.259
Are you feeling okay?

220
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.369
Can you go to work?

221
00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:11.869
What did I tell you yesterday?

222
00:12:12.739 --> 00:12:15.269
You acted like a robot when you met Mr. Sun.

223
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.109
Don't do that.

224
00:12:17.239 --> 00:12:18.609
When he said not to say anything,

225
00:12:18.609 --> 00:12:20.479
he didn't mean you shouldn't even say hi.

226
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.009
Then what does he mean?

227
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.479
He meant you shouldn't...

228
00:12:23.479 --> 00:12:25.080
confess your love, spy on him,

229
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.979
or show him that you like him.

230
00:12:27.489 --> 00:12:29.590
So don't be lame.

231
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.060
Treat him like nothing happened.

232
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:33.420
How can I do that?

233
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.629
How can I not look lame? What should I do?

234
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.359
Okay.

235
00:12:38.499 --> 00:12:39.659
I see.

236
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.300
I got it.

237
00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:44.070
Got it.

238
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.800
Yes. Okay.

239
00:12:48.739 --> 00:12:49.739
What just happened?

240
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.609
Why did I just say that?

241
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.580
This is ridiculous.

242
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.109
Gosh, why did she call me when I was drunk?

243
00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.779
We ended up reconciling just like she wanted.

244
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.820
Goodness, Ji An.

245
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.229
This is refreshing.

246
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.989
(Hae Ja)

247
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:12.830
Hi, Hae Ja.

248
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.670
Mi Jung. I heard Tae Soo is back.

249
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.239
How did you know he's back?

250
00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.940
My husband told me that Tae Soo is in Seoul.

251
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:25.680
He wants to have dinner with you two tonight.

252
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.739
Tonight?

253
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:28.979
Tell her we'll go.

254
00:13:34.989 --> 00:13:38.090
(Exported products from Vietnam)

255
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:41.989
Mr. Jang.

256
00:13:42.859 --> 00:13:44.930
What has happened to me?

257
00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:48.570
I never rested a day since I got married.

258
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.369
I ran and kept on running.

259
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.100
It turns out...

260
00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:57.170
that I'm the most useless father in this world.

261
00:13:57.409 --> 00:13:59.109
Goodness, Tae Soo.

262
00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:01.850
I've never seen you like this.

263
00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:05.920
Was your pride hurt when Ji An left...

264
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.019
for her family as soon as she found out?

265
00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:10.519
That's why you're thinking of running a business?

266
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.859
My pride?

267
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.989
Not everyone can keep their pride.

268
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.700
I can't even take care of my own children.

269
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.070
I don't have any pride for myself.

270
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:30.109
You said you're thinking about closing down...

271
00:14:30.109 --> 00:14:32.139
the factory to switch to importing goods, right?

272
00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:33.879
If I can think of a good item,

273
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.310
I can join you, right?

274
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.210
Of course, you can.

275
00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:39.979
But right now, there's a lot of competition...

276
00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:41.649
for shoes and clothes from Vietnam.

277
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:43.749
We need a turning point in this industry.

278
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:47.119
Okay. Then I'll look into that.

279
00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:48.560
An item that will change the industry.

280
00:14:49.659 --> 00:14:51.700
You sound so determined.

281
00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:53.899
I'm trying to make things right.

282
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.170
I want to make things right for my life.

283
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.470
Hey, you haven't done anything wrong.

284
00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.340
No, I have.

285
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.540
I've had my share of wrongdoings.

286
00:15:04.739 --> 00:15:06.540
I shouldn't have let it get to me.

287
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.180
But I got tired too early.

288
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.820
I should've overcome the fear.

289
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.519
Instead, I stopped.

290
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.320
After all, I am the breadwinner.

291
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.560
My wife and children wanted to rely on me.

292
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.200
But I asked them to cut me some slack.

293
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.170
That's why I lost their trust.

294
00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:31.940
So it's all my fault.

295
00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:36.670
Yes. Keep looking.

296
00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:39.239
I still trust you.

297
00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:47.690
Hello, Mr. Sun.

298
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:48.950
Good morning.

299
00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:52.960
Hello, Mr. Sun. Good morning.

300
00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.590
Good morning.

301
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.690
Good morning. Good morning.

302
00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:04.269
When you used to work at the flower shop,

303
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.070
you used to greet your customers, right?

304
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.609
Greet him like that.

305
00:16:08.609 --> 00:16:10.940
Think of him not as Mr. Sun...

306
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.109
but as a customer.

307
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.279
He is not Mr. Sun.

308
00:16:16.249 --> 00:16:17.479
All right.

309
00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:27.359
Hello.

310
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.300
Well, goodbye.

311
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.249
What's wrong with her?

312
00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:51.720
She must've liked you a lot.

313
00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:53.749
I don't care how much she liked me.

314
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:57.149
She's so mad at me for not liking her.

315
00:16:58.359 --> 00:17:01.790
Do you think she's mad at you?

316
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.729
How else can you explain her behavior?

317
00:17:03.729 --> 00:17:05.399
She's embarrassed.

318
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.060
In that case, I like her even less.

319
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.270
I hate people who can't even control...

320
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.740
their own feelings.

321
00:17:12.439 --> 00:17:15.740
You weren't like that when you were younger.

322
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.209
I mean, you're not bad now,

323
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.209
but sometimes, you are too coldhearted.

324
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.879
It's because you didn't know me growing up.

325
00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:26.379
It's like how I never got to see you grow up.

326
00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.350
Right.

327
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.090
I am sorry.

328
00:17:34.389 --> 00:17:36.260
"To love is not having to say you're sorry."

329
00:17:37.959 --> 00:17:40.699
- What? - Your favorite movie.

330
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.129
Was it the day before your wedding?

331
00:17:43.369 --> 00:17:45.639
You made me watch it and cried your heart out.

332
00:17:45.699 --> 00:17:48.939
Your eyes got all swollen from crying,

333
00:17:48.939 --> 00:17:50.310
and Mom scolded you for it, didn't she?

334
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:53.709
Did I do that? I don't remember.

335
00:18:00.889 --> 00:18:03.820
What? What did you say?

336
00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:06.320
What did you just tell me to do?

337
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.859
Can't you deliver the bread to the cafe?

338
00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:14.100
No. I don't want to.

339
00:18:14.429 --> 00:18:17.300
I... I...

340
00:18:17.399 --> 00:18:19.000
I am the owner.

341
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.939
- Since I am the owner... - No.

342
00:18:21.939 --> 00:18:23.639
I will do it. I am sorry.

343
00:18:23.639 --> 00:18:25.240
I am so stupid that...

344
00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.280
I become even more foolish in front of Mr. Sun.

345
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:29.010
And I get embarrassed. That's all.

346
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:31.619
I cancel what I said. I am sorry.

347
00:18:35.189 --> 00:18:36.189
Gosh.

348
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.219
Father.

349
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.490
It's so nice to see you.

350
00:19:16.129 --> 00:19:17.699
You're back, Grandfather.

351
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.800
Everyone is here.

352
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.750
How could we miss it? It's been half a year.

353
00:19:35.209 --> 00:19:36.510
Let's hurry home.

354
00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:38.879
Jin Hee,

355
00:19:38.919 --> 00:19:41.350
I told you to stop going ahead of yourself.

356
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.020
What?

357
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.659
Drop her at Yangpyeong, and buy her dinner.

358
00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.159
Let's go. I need to go see Eun Seok.

359
00:19:48.159 --> 00:19:49.459
Father,

360
00:19:49.459 --> 00:19:51.760
it's been a long time. We should eat together.

361
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.699
We want to meet Eun Seok too.

362
00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:56.199
Some other time.

363
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.840
Let's go.

364
00:20:07.609 --> 00:20:09.209
What's wrong with Father?

365
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.980
He just wants us to take care of his mistress.

366
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.189
But she's not his mistress.

367
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.820
Our mother is not here.

368
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.560
Straighten your face, and let's go.

369
00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:26.659
Father, why did you tell Jin Hee to leave?

370
00:20:27.129 --> 00:20:28.899
I need to see her first.

371
00:20:29.869 --> 00:20:31.469
That would be better for you.

372
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.310
Jin Hee and Myung Soo must feel bad.

373
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.540
Eun Seok needs to meet them anyway.

374
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.580
You must've had a fight with Myung Hee.

375
00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:45.179
Pardon me?

376
00:20:47.719 --> 00:20:49.350
That's not it, Grandfather.

377
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.189
They've been getting along well since Eun Seok came.

378
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.909
Is this her?

379
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.350
Yes.

380
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:21.889
She's Eun Seok, Father.

381
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.929
I am sorry I didn't greet you at the airport.

382
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.070
I'm Eun Seok.

383
00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:52.280
Oh, dear.

384
00:22:11.139 --> 00:22:14.109
It must've been tough being away from us.

385
00:22:16.139 --> 00:22:17.439
Good job.

386
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.709
Don't mention it.

387
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.419
What should I do every day?

388
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.260
She's going to wear out that shelf.

389
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.090
Ji Soo.

390
00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.000
- Yes? - Come, and knead this.

391
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.300
Knead the dough?

392
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.100
Yes. I have an errand to run.

393
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.510
Really? Do you mean it?

394
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:50.909
Wash your hands cleanly,

395
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.250
and make sure to dry your hands. Okay?

396
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.679
Don't stop kneading until I get back.

397
00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:00.350
Okay. Okay. Okay.

398
00:23:05.219 --> 00:23:06.520
Yes!

399
00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:09.429
Here. I'll pour you a drink.

400
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.790
Now, let's drink.

401
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.230
Nobody else here likes makgeolli.

402
00:23:51.869 --> 00:23:53.570
Bottoms up for the first glass.

403
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.820
Now, I will give you some food to wash it down.

404
00:24:13.959 --> 00:24:14.959
Take this.

405
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.760
Father.

406
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.909
The skate is well fermented.

407
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.080
Is it?

408
00:24:35.879 --> 00:24:36.879
Let's see.

409
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.290
Yes. That's right.

410
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.929
It is well fermented indeed.

411
00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:52.399
She's surely got our blood.

412
00:24:53.459 --> 00:24:57.300
I finally got a grandchild who's got my taste, right?

413
00:25:04.209 --> 00:25:06.740
What did he put in the water?

414
00:25:07.109 --> 00:25:09.449
It's got a unique smell,

415
00:25:09.449 --> 00:25:10.879
but I don't know what it is.

416
00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:15.090
I promised that I wouldn't smell the dough.

417
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.290
I arranged her to be hired as a regular employee...

418
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:19.820
to the Marketing Team.

419
00:25:20.929 --> 00:25:22.090
No.

420
00:25:22.929 --> 00:25:24.100
What do you mean, no?

421
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.659
You confirmed it.

422
00:25:25.659 --> 00:25:28.300
We need something with more impact...

423
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.469
for the storytelling. And it's not enough.

424
00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:30.570
Mr. Choi.

425
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:31.899
Yes, sir.

426
00:25:31.899 --> 00:25:32.899
Appoint Do Kyung...

427
00:25:32.899 --> 00:25:34.709
as Vice Chairman of Haesung Apparel.

428
00:25:35.469 --> 00:25:36.540
What?

429
00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:42.679
Eun Seok works at the Marketing Team,

430
00:25:42.679 --> 00:25:44.820
and Do Kyung becomes the vice chairman.

431
00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.149
And he spots a talented employee.

432
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:50.219
She needs to do something significant.

433
00:25:50.889 --> 00:25:53.490
The ambitious and young vice chairman...

434
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.330
who is trying to raise Haesung Apparel...

435
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.530
will invite a few talented employees...

436
00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.300
to have dinner with him.

437
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.300
As they all drink together,

438
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.169
he would be friendly to the employees...

439
00:26:04.169 --> 00:26:06.669
and ask about their family background.

440
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.169
And something comes up.

441
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.580
An employee named Seo Ji An...

442
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.780
tells him about a memory she faintly remembers.

443
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.480
She says she was once locked in a bird cage.

444
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.320
Hearing that story, Do Kyung gets surprised.

445
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.949
He was the one who locked her in there.

446
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.359
How could I lock my sister in a bird cage?

447
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.830
You must remember it.

448
00:26:31.429 --> 00:26:34.399
Yes. That bird cage is still in our front yard.

449
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.800
I had completely forgotten about it.

450
00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:40.500
Father beat me up for the first time.

451
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.669
I don't remember it.

452
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:46.179
Did Father hit you?

453
00:26:46.179 --> 00:26:48.449
He locked Eun Seok in the bird cage...

454
00:26:48.449 --> 00:26:51.179
and fed her popping candies as the feed.

455
00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.820
You mean the candies that pop in your mouth?

456
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.919
He would think, "I did it,"

457
00:26:57.919 --> 00:26:59.560
"but she remembers it."

458
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.030
He thinks that she might be...

459
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.530
his sister that went missing.

460
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.100
So he looks into her, and it turns out...

461
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.560
that her parents are not her biological parents.

462
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.969
The company's foundation day is in December.

463
00:27:09.969 --> 00:27:12.600
So around mid-November,

464
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.369
destiny will lead you...

465
00:27:16.369 --> 00:27:18.139
to find your long-lost sister.

466
00:27:21.379 --> 00:27:23.179
That way, we will be able to get away...

467
00:27:23.179 --> 00:27:25.119
from the media trying to find out how we found her.

468
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.850
When one side is so dramatic,

469
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.189
the other side gets no attention.

470
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.320
Regarding how we lost her and found her,

471
00:27:32.689 --> 00:27:35.530
whatever we say will be accepted as the truth.

472
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.560
Until it happens in November,

473
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.330
we will have enough time to train Eun Seok.

474
00:27:41.969 --> 00:27:44.939
Then will Do Kyung already become the vice chairman?

475
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.240
Are you making sure that everyone is kept quiet?

476
00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:51.139
Give them however much they ask for.

477
00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:53.139
We are doing that.

478
00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:55.209
Don't let it affect Do Kyung's marriage.

479
00:27:55.209 --> 00:27:56.379
Eun Seok...

480
00:27:56.379 --> 00:27:58.280
shouldn't do any harm to his career.

481
00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:00.379
We will make sure of it.

482
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.689
What's wrong with the quality of this air?

483
00:28:08.689 --> 00:28:10.730
We checked the circulation system...

484
00:28:10.859 --> 00:28:12.500
and eliminated the ultra fine particles.

485
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.129
We have even tested it.

486
00:28:14.429 --> 00:28:16.000
I need to go to Yangpyeong.

487
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.770
Nobody can measure up to Father.

488
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.770
Now, the story sounds much believable.

489
00:28:23.609 --> 00:28:25.510
Since it happened within our family,

490
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.649
nobody will doubt it or look into it.

491
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.879
How did he come up with that idea?

492
00:28:30.679 --> 00:28:32.679
You're far from it.

493
00:28:32.679 --> 00:28:34.389
You have a long way to catch up with him.

494
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.490
What do you mean?

495
00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.219
We both know that...

496
00:28:38.219 --> 00:28:39.790
this isn't just for storytelling.

497
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.330
He is not making Do Kyung the vice chairman...

498
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.629
just to introduce Eun Seok dramatically.

499
00:28:49.469 --> 00:28:50.469
Honey.

500
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.169
We've been expecting it, so it's fine.

501
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.469
But I don't like the fact that he's using...

502
00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.179
my precious daughter for this.

503
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.409
It's catching 2 birds with 1 stone.

504
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:02.709
Why would you make him sound bad?

505
00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:06.580
Who's catching 2 birds with 1 stone?

506
00:29:08.189 --> 00:29:09.919
Who is responsible for losing Eun Seok?

507
00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:12.219
How poor was the family Eun Seok grew up in?

508
00:29:12.219 --> 00:29:13.790
How much did she struggle to get a decent job?

509
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.629
That story will get rid of those gossips,

510
00:29:15.629 --> 00:29:17.600
and that's why I think it's a win-win.

511
00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:20.500
But who else would benefit from this?

512
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.840
I chose the wrong words.

513
00:29:26.439 --> 00:29:29.040
He's using Eun Seok as an excuse...

514
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.139
to make Do Kyung his successor.

515
00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.609
For you and your father,

516
00:29:33.609 --> 00:29:34.949
this would be killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

517
00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.679
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

518
00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:42.050
I admitted to my wrongful choice of words.

519
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.290
And Father never said anything concrete.

520
00:29:53.969 --> 00:29:56.070
Congratulations on your promotion.

521
00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.770
It's not something to congratulate.

522
00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.669
It may be the beginning of the successor test.

523
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:03.070
Successor test?

524
00:30:03.209 --> 00:30:04.740
Don't be ridiculous.

525
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.280
I am just informing her about our family.

526
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.949
Grandfather never says to anyone...

527
00:30:10.949 --> 00:30:13.020
whom he's going to choose as his successor.

528
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:16.419
It could be Father, Uncle Myung Soo,

529
00:30:16.419 --> 00:30:18.119
or Aunt Jin Hee's son.

530
00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:21.129
Now, there's a possibility of it being him.

531
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:22.429
That's how it is.

532
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.230
I see.

533
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.100
You did well today.

534
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.469
You were quite good.

535
00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:29.669
Eating skate against her will?

536
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:31.800
I didn't eat it against my will.

537
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.869
I do enjoy skate and makgeolli.

538
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.609
Your taste is very unusual.

539
00:30:38.209 --> 00:30:39.439
I don't like them that much.

540
00:30:39.439 --> 00:30:41.109
I like spicy foods.

541
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.480
Right. Let's do that tomorrow.

542
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:45.149
What is it?

543
00:30:46.179 --> 00:30:47.590
I'm talking to Eun Seok.

544
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.619
What are you doing with her tomorrow?

545
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.320
It's a secret.

546
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.189
You should choose the time and place.

547
00:30:58.129 --> 00:30:59.629
It's a secret.

548
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.869
What's going on?

549
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.270
Did he become close with her too?

550
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.080
Okay.

551
00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.889
What are you doing, Ji Ho?

552
00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.090
Mom, my nose is bleeding.

553
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.560
Oh, dear.

554
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.790
- What should I do, Mom? - My goodness.

555
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.959
Raise your head.

556
00:31:31.959 --> 00:31:33.330
- It won't stop. - Why is it bleeding?

557
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.169
Why is your nose bleeding? My goodness.

558
00:31:35.169 --> 00:31:37.340
Lie down.

559
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.639
You had never bled from your nose before.

560
00:31:40.639 --> 00:31:42.369
You never even caught a cold before.

561
00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:43.909
How could this happen?

562
00:31:44.109 --> 00:31:45.179
I don't know.

563
00:31:45.209 --> 00:31:48.280
I've been feeling dizzy for a few days.

564
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.419
Dizzy? Could it be anemia?

565
00:31:51.419 --> 00:31:52.449
No.

566
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.649
It's the lack of sleep.

567
00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.520
So don't worry about me.

568
00:31:59.689 --> 00:32:01.260
You should go, Mom.

569
00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:04.359
I'm supposed to meet Hae Ja.

570
00:32:04.359 --> 00:32:07.600
Don't worry. I'll be fine after sleeping.

571
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.530
Right.

572
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.409
Here's my report card.

573
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.540
Goodness.

574
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.480
Your grades improved a lot. Gosh.

575
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.050
Of course. I tried hard fabricating...

576
00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.520
I studied hard.

577
00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:32.859
Gosh, I am late.

578
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.030
Where is Ji Ho?

579
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.500
He's going to sleep.

580
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.199
By the way, I should buy some...

581
00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:44.500
Did you buy something?

582
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.469
I bought some fruits.

583
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:56.050
You didn't have to bring all this.

584
00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.020
Seok Doo likes peaches.

585
00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.250
Mi Jung,

586
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.750
he hurt his hand.

587
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:04.659
You should've carried it. It's heavy.

588
00:33:04.659 --> 00:33:07.060
My right hand is fine.

589
00:33:07.689 --> 00:33:08.929
What is this?

590
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.530
Goodness.

591
00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:14.399
It's conch bread and butter bread.

592
00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:17.129
Why did you buy such old-fashioned ones?

593
00:33:17.439 --> 00:33:20.639
I can't believe you still remember this.

594
00:33:20.639 --> 00:33:22.070
No matter how delicious foods are,

595
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.379
they don't measure up to your old favorites.

596
00:33:24.609 --> 00:33:25.780
That's right.

597
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.879
I've been loving these since middle school.

598
00:33:27.879 --> 00:33:29.449
I am hungry.

599
00:33:29.449 --> 00:33:31.619
Stop making a fuss, and go fix the meal.

600
00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:33.850
It's already done.

601
00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:35.219
Thank you.

602
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:40.189
Hey, why do you yell at your wife?

603
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.899
You must feel sad...

604
00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.969
now that Ji An's left.

605
00:33:48.969 --> 00:33:50.939
Why would you ask that?

606
00:33:50.939 --> 00:33:52.240
Is there nothing better to say?

607
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.609
I just want to comfort them.

608
00:33:54.609 --> 00:33:56.139
Comfort them?

609
00:33:56.139 --> 00:33:57.909
Just ask what you are curious about.

610
00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.149
Wives are ridiculous. They disguise...

611
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:02.709
curiosity with concern.

612
00:34:02.709 --> 00:34:05.179
They're so good at feeding their curiosity.

613
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:08.790
What did Ji An say?

614
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.549
Is she happy to have left?

615
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:13.790
What will they do to you?

616
00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.560
You raised her without reporting to the police.

617
00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.330
Are they not going to punish you?

618
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.400
Hae Ja.

619
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.199
You told me to ask questions.

620
00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:25.239
Why do you keep shouting at her?

621
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.869
It's only natural that she's curious.

622
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:29.139
Right, Tae Soo?

623
00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.940
It's only natural, isn't it?

624
00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.210
It is. It is natural that you're curious,

625
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:34.679
but hear it from her later.

626
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.750
It's not something to discuss here.

627
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.219
All right. I am sorry, Tae Soo.

628
00:34:40.279 --> 00:34:41.489
The meat is burning.

629
00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.449
My goodness.

630
00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:45.790
It's Korean beef, so it should be cooked slightly.

631
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.130
Let me do it.

632
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.400
Don't worry about it. Our guests shouldn't cook.

633
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.529
I am in charge of grilling meat at home.

634
00:34:53.529 --> 00:34:54.799
I am good at it.

635
00:34:58.839 --> 00:35:01.869
How is it possible?

636
00:35:01.869 --> 00:35:03.440
You've been friends for 35 years,

637
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.710
but you two are so different.

638
00:35:07.449 --> 00:35:08.779
It's all your fault.

639
00:35:08.779 --> 00:35:11.080
I thought he'd be like you, so I married him.

640
00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.049
Okay. I'm sorry.

641
00:35:13.719 --> 00:35:17.190
But still, he makes good money.

642
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.920
I don't need that money.

643
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.060
I just want to live with a man like you.

644
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:25.360
It doesn't matter if he has money or not.

645
00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.830
He always cares about Mi Jung.

646
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.299
She always comes first, and his kids come next.

647
00:35:30.299 --> 00:35:31.900
And he comes last.

648
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.600
I've never seen Tae Soo...

649
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.069
coming home late without calling his wife.

650
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:39.339
And he never complains about the food.

651
00:35:39.779 --> 00:35:41.110
Even today,

652
00:35:43.009 --> 00:35:45.580
he remembered what I liked and bought it for me.

653
00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.650
Hae Ja, you don't know him. You can't say that.

654
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.219
Your husband would be upset.

655
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.759
Mi Jung, I'm not upset at all.

656
00:35:53.319 --> 00:35:54.690
I feel the same way.

657
00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:58.000
I just married her because she was...

658
00:35:58.659 --> 00:36:01.929
Tae Soo's old friend. I didn't like her that much.

659
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.139
How could you say that?

660
00:36:04.139 --> 00:36:05.739
You are embarrassing her.

661
00:36:06.299 --> 00:36:07.469
Mi Jung.

662
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.869
I've changed a lot, right?

663
00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.940
My life is parted into two episodes.

664
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.480
Before I got cancer and after I survived from it.

665
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.350
When you were diagnosed with stage three cancer,

666
00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.819
she took good care of you.

667
00:36:22.819 --> 00:36:24.619
You should be nice to her.

668
00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.560
Mi Jung.

669
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.460
Please don't give Tae Soo a hard time.

670
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.029
Do you want him to go through what I did?

671
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.500
Tae Soo.

672
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.940
What is he talking about?

673
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.369
Hey, stop your nonsense.

674
00:36:43.739 --> 00:36:44.739
Mi Jung.

675
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.250
Do you know why Tae Soo wants to start a business?

676
00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:49.850
Start a business?

677
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.219
He has no money to start a business.

678
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.719
I don't need money for that.

679
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.920
I'll just be in charge of exports from here.

680
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.589
And Seok Doo will import the goods in Vietnam.

681
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.199
Now that Ji An is gone,

682
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.299
he must've been worried about the other children.

683
00:37:10.369 --> 00:37:12.739
Tae Soo told me something when I met him in Daejeon.

684
00:37:13.569 --> 00:37:17.040
Now that Ji An's gone, he'd get back on his feet.

685
00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.679
Seok Doo, stop talking that nonsense.

686
00:37:20.409 --> 00:37:22.380
Ji An just left...

687
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.049
as soon as she found it out.

688
00:37:24.049 --> 00:37:27.049
I knew it would be very hard for you.

689
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.190
I liked it though.

690
00:37:29.819 --> 00:37:31.619
There was a sudden liveliness in his face.

691
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.889
It felt like the young Seo Tae Soo was back.

692
00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.819
(Speech Technic)

693
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.259
This is the HR department of Haesung Apparel.

694
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.500
We'd like to offer you a permanent position...

695
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.869
in the Marketing Team of Haesung Apparel.

696
00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:23.839
You'll be working as a regular employee...

697
00:38:24.009 --> 00:38:25.839
at Haesung Apparel's Marketing Team.

698
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:29.009
This is amazing.

699
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.779
As soon as she said it, it just happened.

700
00:38:38.389 --> 00:38:39.389
Seo Hyun.

701
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.389
I got a call that I became a regular employee...

702
00:38:42.389 --> 00:38:43.529
for the Marketing Team.

703
00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.360
Is that so?

704
00:38:46.799 --> 00:38:48.469
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

705
00:38:49.929 --> 00:38:51.500
Why would you want to be congratulated...

706
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.699
when you're hired at your family's company?

707
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.509
You still can't believe who you really are, right?

708
00:38:56.739 --> 00:38:59.009
You're not the vice president or such.

709
00:38:59.179 --> 00:39:01.909
You're just an employee. Don't be flattered.

710
00:39:01.909 --> 00:39:03.179
You're embarrassing me.

711
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:16.659
Drive safe. I'm not in a good mood.

712
00:39:17.799 --> 00:39:18.929
Yes, ma'am.

713
00:39:23.699 --> 00:39:24.799
What was that?

714
00:39:24.839 --> 00:39:26.469
I just thought you'd need some air.

715
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:30.409
That's weird. How did you know how I feel?

716
00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.880
A new nail drives out the old one.

717
00:39:55.299 --> 00:39:56.569
Choi Seo Hyun.

718
00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.270
Why didn't you answer when we asked you...

719
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:01.440
if you'd go on a senior trip?

720
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.770
Because I won't go.

721
00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:04.110
Then you should've told us...

722
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.610
that you wouldn't go. Did you not read the notice?

723
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.650
If I didn't say anything, it means I wouldn't go.

724
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.210
You know I don't go to such places.

725
00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.089
All right.

726
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:17.489
Why do you never attend school events?

727
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:18.860
I just don't want to.

728
00:40:22.089 --> 00:40:23.360
I just asked you why.

729
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:28.830
Do I have to tell you why?

730
00:40:29.369 --> 00:40:30.670
That's rude.

731
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.799
Rude?

732
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:37.069
Hey. You're the one who's rude. You're ignoring us.

733
00:40:37.909 --> 00:40:39.839
I'm not ignoring you. That's just my character.

734
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.250
You just want to show off your background.

735
00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.380
You ignored the notice in our chat room.

736
00:40:45.719 --> 00:40:47.589
Then why would you hold the recital with us?

737
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.750
Why would you attend the chamber music class?

738
00:40:50.549 --> 00:40:51.860
Why don't you just play as a solo?

739
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:55.589
You're the only daughter of Haesung Corporation.

740
00:40:56.759 --> 00:41:00.130
Now that the professors try to please you,

741
00:41:00.429 --> 00:41:02.830
you may expect us to pay our court to you.

742
00:41:03.569 --> 00:41:06.339
But we'll make a new chat room without you.

743
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.540
When we'd rehearse for the graduation recital...

744
00:41:09.639 --> 00:41:11.739
and when we'd have the chamber music class.

745
00:41:12.409 --> 00:41:15.009
You'll have to come to ask me that.

746
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.850
You haven't said anything until now, but why...

747
00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:20.949
Because I want to.

748
00:41:30.089 --> 00:41:31.360
Okay, I'll do that.

749
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.670
What?

750
00:41:35.469 --> 00:41:37.299
Actually, I don't even check the chat room.

751
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.069
I even turned off the alarm.

752
00:41:40.239 --> 00:41:41.440
You don't check the chat room?

753
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.469
I have someone to keep me updated. Didn't you know?

754
00:41:43.909 --> 00:41:46.279
How do you call yourself a student representative?

755
00:41:46.279 --> 00:41:47.880
Hey, what did you just say?

756
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.009
If you hit me,

757
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.949
you'll be kicked out of school.

758
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.219
Do you want to drop out of college?

759
00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.860
You've tried to please me for the past four years.

760
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.799
It's just mean to bully me right before you graduate.

761
00:42:09.929 --> 00:42:13.770
And you should be careful about whom you bully.

762
00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.569
If you got that, get lost.

763
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.009
I'll carry it.

764
00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.980
- Gosh. - Choi Seo Hyun!

765
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:50.610
I'll be back after lunch.

766
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.210
But why would she go to Namdaemun?

767
00:42:53.909 --> 00:42:55.610
Your sister really is something.

768
00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.119
She makes you to even visit Namdaemun.

769
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.790
I even signed an oath to keep the secret.

770
00:43:02.949 --> 00:43:05.420
I don't want to blow all my money for that.

771
00:43:06.159 --> 00:43:08.690
Then why does she eat ramyeon and spicy foods...

772
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:11.159
when she knows it's not good for her health?

773
00:43:11.299 --> 00:43:12.299
Because it's delicious.

774
00:43:12.299 --> 00:43:13.830
Would you give up health for taste?

775
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.100
She just can't control herself.

776
00:43:17.339 --> 00:43:19.670
I still have a long way to teach her things. Gosh.

777
00:43:22.509 --> 00:43:24.380
Hey, move aside!

778
00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.279
This looks totally inappropriate.

779
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.830
Oh, you're here early.

780
00:43:44.799 --> 00:43:46.759
I always arrive five minutes earlier.

781
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.500
Didn't you learn that from Ms. Yang?

782
00:43:49.929 --> 00:43:52.139
But this is five minutes before our schedule.

783
00:43:52.139 --> 00:43:53.199
But you came running.

784
00:43:54.509 --> 00:43:56.009
No matter whom you meet with,

785
00:43:56.009 --> 00:43:57.710
you have to be punctual.

786
00:43:57.739 --> 00:43:59.339
Especially when it is for business.

787
00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.750
Okay.

788
00:44:01.509 --> 00:44:02.549
By the way,

789
00:44:02.679 --> 00:44:05.549
this place is so crowded, dusty, and noisy.

790
00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:07.549
What do you want to eat here?

791
00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:10.819
There are various foods at the Namdaemun Market.

792
00:44:10.819 --> 00:44:12.420
There are a lot of delicious things.

793
00:44:14.659 --> 00:44:16.529
Come this way.

794
00:44:37.779 --> 00:44:39.279
What do you think you're doing?

795
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.119
The main dish is not served yet.

796
00:44:43.089 --> 00:44:44.860
Do you care about that in a restaurant like this?

797
00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.489
It doesn't matter where you eat.

798
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:49.429
Wherever you are, you are just who you are.

799
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960
Keep your dignity.

800
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:53.929
Here's the hairtail.

801
00:44:55.799 --> 00:44:56.929
Seriously.

802
00:45:00.339 --> 00:45:01.440
What?

803
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.409
I'll wait until you pick up your spoon.

804
00:45:04.409 --> 00:45:06.710
I won't eat, so go ahead.

805
00:45:07.239 --> 00:45:09.279
You won't eat? It's tasty.

806
00:45:09.279 --> 00:45:10.310
No thanks.

807
00:45:11.779 --> 00:45:13.989
I ordered two portions because we have to.

808
00:45:14.049 --> 00:45:15.119
It's really good.

809
00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:18.060
I said no thanks. I'm just here for you.

810
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.219
So eat up.

811
00:45:21.029 --> 00:45:23.360
If that's the case, I'll eat then.

812
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Ma'am, can I have another bowl of...

813
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.969
Are you going to eat that?

814
00:46:09.069 --> 00:46:10.739
I will never.

815
00:46:11.179 --> 00:46:12.909
Then I'll eat it.

816
00:46:22.719 --> 00:46:24.020
I am amazed.

817
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.869
Oh, thank you.

818
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:38.339
I feel so much better.

819
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.610
I don't think you'll last the night.

820
00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.739
- What? - You ate two portions...

821
00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:47.480
in just 12 minutes.

822
00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.480
That's not the stomach of a human being.

823
00:46:50.509 --> 00:46:52.049
Let's get you some antacids.

824
00:46:58.119 --> 00:46:59.420
We're supposed to...

825
00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.460
send these off today.

826
00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:03.130
I didn't know the paint was there.

827
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:05.360
Mr. Sun Woo.

828
00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.369
They won't be able to tell if we...

829
00:47:07.369 --> 00:47:08.830
grind it off with a sander.

830
00:47:09.369 --> 00:47:11.639
We won't sand anything off.

831
00:47:11.639 --> 00:47:14.509
You try sanding it off as best as you can.

832
00:47:14.509 --> 00:47:16.940
It won't look or feel the same.

833
00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:18.380
We need to cut more wood.

834
00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.580
Get the cutter.

835
00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.509
You punk.

836
00:47:23.449 --> 00:47:25.449
Did he have to hit the back of my head?

837
00:47:25.449 --> 00:47:27.389
- You got lucky. - What?

838
00:47:27.389 --> 00:47:29.520
If he hadn't gotten to you first,

839
00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:31.989
I'd have hit you with a piece of wood.

840
00:47:32.659 --> 00:47:33.719
Move it.

841
00:47:33.819 --> 00:47:34.830
Okay.

842
00:47:36.389 --> 00:47:37.630
Mr. Sun Woo.

843
00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.560
Why aren't you calling...

844
00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.799
the person who ordered that chair?

845
00:47:41.799 --> 00:47:43.900
We'll send it by express today.

846
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.500
Call to apologize for the delay.

847
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.639
Yes, sir.

848
00:47:55.179 --> 00:47:56.380
Inside your bag,

849
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.020
you'll find an envelope of money.

850
00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.480
If you're really my friend,

851
00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.119
then give me some time.

852
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.730
I'll tell you everything soon.

853
00:48:08.759 --> 00:48:10.029
She must've seen it.

854
00:48:10.029 --> 00:48:12.659
Why hasn't she called me yet?

855
00:48:13.029 --> 00:48:14.569
I'm worried now.

856
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.600
I wanted to be cool and wait.

857
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:26.139
The number you dialed does not exist.

858
00:48:28.179 --> 00:48:29.179
Ji An.

859
00:48:32.619 --> 00:48:35.750
The number you dialed does not exist.

860
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:45.100
Aren't you hungry?

861
00:48:45.759 --> 00:48:46.830
I am.

862
00:48:47.429 --> 00:48:49.799
Haven't you eaten at a place like this?

863
00:48:49.799 --> 00:48:51.699
Why would I come here to eat?

864
00:48:51.699 --> 00:48:54.110
The food's really good. Really.

865
00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:55.869
There are so many better, tastier,

866
00:48:55.869 --> 00:48:58.179
cleaner, and nicer restaurants...

867
00:48:58.179 --> 00:49:00.009
that only use organic ingredients.

868
00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:01.949
I shouldn't have brought you here...

869
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.949
if you weren't going to eat.

870
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.819
No. It's my favor for keeping our secret...

871
00:49:07.819 --> 00:49:09.719
about the 20,000 dollars.

872
00:49:09.719 --> 00:49:11.460
I'll deal with it willingly.

873
00:49:13.889 --> 00:49:15.190
Where are we?

874
00:49:15.489 --> 00:49:17.960
That way. Our car is over there.

875
00:49:21.029 --> 00:49:22.029
Are you okay?

876
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:24.869
What?

877
00:49:24.869 --> 00:49:26.639
Where is my necklace?

878
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:30.369
What? That necklace cost a fortune. Gosh.

879
00:49:31.139 --> 00:49:33.080
Thief! Get him!

880
00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.080
Get him for me!

881
00:49:35.179 --> 00:49:36.179
Stop!

882
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.389
Eun Seok!

883
00:49:58.199 --> 00:49:59.799
Watch where you're going!

884
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.409
Gosh, what am I doing?

885
00:50:05.839 --> 00:50:06.880
Brother!

886
00:50:07.179 --> 00:50:08.279
I'm over here.

887
00:50:08.279 --> 00:50:09.310
That way.

888
00:50:09.779 --> 00:50:10.850
What?

889
00:50:11.049 --> 00:50:12.150
How'd you get here already?

890
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:13.480
I took a shortcut.

891
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.020
This is my neighborhood.

892
00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:16.549
Right.

893
00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.130
- What are you doing? - What?

894
00:50:27.699 --> 00:50:28.929
- Get out of my way. - What?

895
00:50:31.299 --> 00:50:32.639
Hey.

896
00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.880
I got him. I got him.

897
00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:43.480
What the...

898
00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:51.020
Come on, let's go.

899
00:50:51.119 --> 00:50:52.589
No, the necklace!

900
00:50:52.589 --> 00:50:54.290
Hey. Really?

901
00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:58.460
Hey!

902
00:51:04.739 --> 00:51:06.000
Hey!

903
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.610
Let's go.

904
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:17.350
Wait, the necklace.

905
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:18.980
Hurry, hurry.

906
00:51:23.119 --> 00:51:24.389
Hurry up. This way.

907
00:51:37.869 --> 00:51:40.600
Have you lost your mind?

908
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:43.670
You went after a man with a knife.

909
00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:45.679
What for?

910
00:51:45.679 --> 00:51:47.750
What? Will you die without that necklace?

911
00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.250
It was a gift from you.

912
00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:55.049
And you said that it's expensive.

913
00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.190
Even if it is so,

914
00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.089
you can always get another necklace,

915
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.259
but you only have one life.

916
00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.429
And so do I.

917
00:52:05.429 --> 00:52:08.270
I almost died trying to save you.

918
00:52:08.299 --> 00:52:09.630
He recognized its value...

919
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:11.569
and would do anything for it.

920
00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:17.009
What a scumbag. He broke the chain.

921
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.650
We should've taken him to the police.

922
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:22.380
Do you think they got him?

923
00:52:22.679 --> 00:52:24.119
Gosh, I don't care.

924
00:52:24.119 --> 00:52:27.319
Do you think he's looking for us?

925
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.989
He can't be.

926
00:52:29.219 --> 00:52:31.489
- Oh, no. - What? What is it?

927
00:52:32.089 --> 00:52:34.230
My goodness. What was that for?

928
00:52:34.429 --> 00:52:37.159
Do you get startled like that too?

929
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.360
How dare you tease me?

930
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:44.369
You've been calling me brother.

931
00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:45.869
What?

932
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.369
Well...

933
00:52:48.869 --> 00:52:50.909
What else would I call you?

934
00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.009
Let's go.

935
00:52:56.009 --> 00:52:58.179
I took too long a lunch break...

936
00:52:58.179 --> 00:53:00.049
because of my cheeky little sister.

937
00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:12.429
Stop mixing soju with beer.

938
00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:14.429
Are you trying to kill him before marriage?

939
00:53:15.369 --> 00:53:16.869
Jin Seok loves soju and beer.

940
00:53:16.869 --> 00:53:19.440
Let him drink all he wants before his wedding.

941
00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.540
I signed an oath not to drink anymore.

942
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:25.139
Seriously?

943
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.449
You idiot.

944
00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.080
Leave it.

945
00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.719
He chased his fiancee for three years...

946
00:53:30.719 --> 00:53:32.080
until she gave in.

947
00:53:33.679 --> 00:53:35.949
Ji Tae, why don't you get married?

948
00:53:35.949 --> 00:53:38.159
It's serious if you dated for four years.

949
00:53:38.889 --> 00:53:40.020
We broke up.

950
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:41.330
What?

951
00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.489
- Why? - Why?

952
00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.029
Why else?

953
00:53:44.029 --> 00:53:45.730
It was about time to do so.

954
00:53:46.199 --> 00:53:49.199
You look a bit too normal.

955
00:53:49.469 --> 00:53:51.969
You said you'd break up only if someone...

956
00:53:51.969 --> 00:53:53.500
fell out of love.

957
00:53:53.839 --> 00:53:55.040
Who was it?

958
00:53:56.509 --> 00:53:58.239
It was Soo A.

959
00:54:00.339 --> 00:54:02.179
Only I was against marriage.

960
00:54:02.179 --> 00:54:03.179
Soo A...

961
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.049
She should get married.

962
00:54:06.279 --> 00:54:07.920
She's my age.

963
00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:11.119
Forget about your pride, and get her back.

964
00:54:12.619 --> 00:54:13.690
My pride?

965
00:54:14.029 --> 00:54:16.029
I know your situation and future outlook,

966
00:54:16.029 --> 00:54:19.100
but you've never liked anyone as much...

967
00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.069
or dated anyone as long as you did her.

968
00:54:21.799 --> 00:54:23.199
Get her back, or you'll regret it.

969
00:54:23.199 --> 00:54:24.639
What for?

970
00:54:25.799 --> 00:54:28.210
So we can live in a tiny leased room?

971
00:54:29.509 --> 00:54:31.509
We'll work for a few years...

972
00:54:31.509 --> 00:54:33.080
just to barely afford a place.

973
00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.449
If we have a kid, it all stops there.

974
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:38.549
The best we can do is...

975
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:40.119
a two-room apartment lease in Seoul.

976
00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.350
That's how we all do it.

977
00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.259
- That's life. - You're right.

978
00:54:44.259 --> 00:54:47.529
Hey, when you got married at 27,

979
00:54:47.529 --> 00:54:50.130
your parents bought you an apartment in Gangnam.

980
00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:51.360
Hey.

981
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.759
You send your son to an English kindergarten.

982
00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.069
It costs 1,200 dollars a month.

983
00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.869
You've been sending your kid and wife...

984
00:54:58.869 --> 00:55:01.069
to Canada twice a year since he was three.

985
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:03.839
Come on, Ji Tae. He was born rich.

986
00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:05.710
Don't compare yourself to him.

987
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.350
Let's talk about you, then.

988
00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:11.279
Your parents paid half the lease for your house.

989
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:15.589
And you save up most of your salary, don't you?

990
00:55:16.819 --> 00:55:18.619
At least you don't have any debts.

991
00:55:20.259 --> 00:55:23.690
I'm still paying off our house lease debts,

992
00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.929
and it's still not over.

993
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.699
I apologize.

994
00:55:28.699 --> 00:55:30.770
I wanted to say Soo A's a catch.

995
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.270
My future kid...

996
00:55:33.369 --> 00:55:34.839
will probably study at home...

997
00:55:35.409 --> 00:55:36.940
or a local cram school.

998
00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:42.009
What if one of my parents were to fall ill?

999
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:47.489
Why would I ask a woman to share that burden?

1000
00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.920
To a woman I love?

1001
00:55:52.889 --> 00:55:55.360
No. I don't want to live like that.

1002
00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:59.330
A fool like me getting married and having kids?

1003
00:56:01.869 --> 00:56:03.100
It's unfair to the kid.

1004
00:56:06.239 --> 00:56:07.610
Your hair's short,

1005
00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:09.909
so there's not much I can do.

1006
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:12.480
Then perm it.

1007
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.810
Really curly. Like a middle-aged woman.

1008
00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:17.750
Curly like a middle-aged woman?

1009
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:22.319
I just want to look as different as possible.

1010
00:56:22.889 --> 00:56:23.889
Different?

1011
00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.489
I have a dream

1012
00:56:27.489 --> 00:56:30.060
Think about a future where

1013
00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:32.759
I'll give you a great life

1014
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.029
We have nothing to lose

1015
00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:38.040
Bet your life on me

1016
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.810
There's no need to see fortune-tellers

1017
00:56:42.909 --> 00:56:45.009
Just look at him sing.

1018
00:56:45.009 --> 00:56:48.080
He was lead vocalist in his school band.

1019
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.350
But why did he major in public administration?

1020
00:56:50.779 --> 00:56:53.819
He's the eldest, and singing was just a hobby.

1021
00:56:53.819 --> 00:56:55.389
It's not like that.

1022
00:56:55.449 --> 00:56:57.819
He was going to transfer and study music.

1023
00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.159
Then his dad's business failed and...

1024
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:04.199
- Really? - It was a secret.

1025
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.630
I didn't hear anything.

1026
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:08.170
I didn't say anything. Nothing happened.

1027
00:57:08.369 --> 00:57:10.429
Gosh, that poor guy. Seriously.

1028
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:15.409
Ji Tae!

1029
00:57:15.569 --> 00:57:17.339
- Ji Tae. - Ji Tae!

1030
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:23.949
I actually feel pleased

1031
00:57:24.279 --> 00:57:26.819
I'll hold it in until then

1032
00:57:26.819 --> 00:57:29.819
For my dream

1033
00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:57.819
Excuse me.

1034
00:57:58.719 --> 00:58:01.920
I'm really sorry to disturb you.

1035
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.960
First, let me introduce myself.

1036
00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:09.989
I saw you at the salon earlier.

1037
00:58:10.799 --> 00:58:12.060
I got a perm too.

1038
00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.069
That was four hours ago.

1039
00:58:14.299 --> 00:58:16.670
I then met with a client.

1040
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:19.040
I was leaving after dinner and saw you again.

1041
00:58:21.409 --> 00:58:22.810
So what do you want?

1042
00:58:23.469 --> 00:58:25.980
You left the salon looking very different...

1043
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.610
from when you came in.

1044
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:32.279
Then you didn't fall for my makeup.

1045
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:35.089
I liked you both before and after the makeup.

1046
00:58:35.319 --> 00:58:37.150
Then I happened to see you again.

1047
00:58:37.819 --> 00:58:39.119
It's like meeting you for the third time.

1048
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:42.190
You know that...

1049
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:45.529
I will not turn you down, right?

1050
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:48.000
Unless this is a fake.

1051
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.630
It's not a fake.

1052
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.270
I can't believe I got so lucky.

1053
00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:56.810
Me, meeting a lawyer?

1054
00:58:57.779 --> 00:58:59.080
In a luxury car...

1055
00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:02.880
who's tall, dresses well, and is handsome.

1056
00:59:04.219 --> 00:59:05.819
I'm wondering if this is a dream.

1057
00:59:07.179 --> 00:59:09.219
I'm heading to a friend's opening party.

1058
00:59:10.819 --> 00:59:12.089
Will you join me?

1059
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:17.460
You can confirm there who I really am.

1060
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.699
Not today. If you don't mind, I'll call tomorrow.

1061
00:59:24.239 --> 00:59:25.739
Sure, then.

1062
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:27.610
I'd have preferred it be today,

1063
00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:29.009
but as long as you call, I'll be fine with that.

1064
00:59:30.409 --> 00:59:31.639
Goodbye.

1065
00:59:33.779 --> 00:59:35.150
Please call me.

1066
00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.520
What if

1067
00:59:42.449 --> 00:59:43.819
We had been

1068
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.659
A little younger?

1069
00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:52.360
What would it have been like then?

1070
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.569
What if

1071
01:00:00.969 --> 01:00:03.540
We just go ahead like this?

1072
01:00:04.679 --> 01:00:07.509
Will we have any regrets?

1073
01:00:09.779 --> 01:00:12.779
Our relationship has been

1074
01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:14.949
Controlled by time

1075
01:00:16.219 --> 01:00:20.830
Even if we are not allowed any more time

1076
01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:28.469
What if

1077
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.869
We had been

1078
01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.279
A little younger?

1079
01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:43.580
What if

1080
01:00:46.049 --> 01:00:48.750
We just go ahead like this?

1081
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.869
The number you have dialed is not available...

1082
01:01:05.869 --> 01:01:08.270
Why isn't he picking up? Goodness.

1083
01:01:19.449 --> 01:01:20.520
Get out.

1084
01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:23.049
Why'd you have so much to drink?

1085
01:01:23.049 --> 01:01:24.290
- Get going. - Gosh.

1086
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:41.069
Ji Tae. Ji Tae.

1087
01:01:41.069 --> 01:01:42.610
Wake up.

1088
01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:43.710
You fool.

1089
01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.310
Hey, get up.

1090
01:01:48.279 --> 01:01:50.409
Come on. Ji Tae.

1091
01:01:50.509 --> 01:01:52.020
Walk, will you?

1092
01:01:55.989 --> 01:01:57.889
Hey, Ji Ho, Ji Ho.

1093
01:01:57.889 --> 01:01:59.889
Help your brother.

1094
01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:01.690
What happened?

1095
01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:03.429
He stinks of alcohol.

1096
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.730
My goodness.

1097
01:02:10.199 --> 01:02:12.100
Dad, are you okay?

1098
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:14.869
Yes, I'm fine.

1099
01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.440
I think he broke up with his girlfriend.

1100
01:02:22.509 --> 01:02:23.810
Don't tell him that you know.

1101
01:02:24.179 --> 01:02:28.089
He didn't even tell me he was seeing someone.

1102
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.489
Help him change.

1103
01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:36.730
And don't tell him that I brought him home.

1104
01:02:36.889 --> 01:02:37.900
Okay.

1105
01:03:04.759 --> 01:03:07.020
What time did you come home, Ji Tae?

1106
01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.560
Quite late.

1107
01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:10.929
You still reek of alcohol.

1108
01:03:11.159 --> 01:03:14.000
A close colleague quit, so we went drinking.

1109
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:16.730
Have some hangover soup. It's dried pollack soup.

1110
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:18.469
Okay.

1111
01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:27.380
Do what you did before.

1112
01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:30.080
It's Haesung Apparel, but the work's the same.

1113
01:03:30.819 --> 01:03:31.980
Okay.

1114
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:34.049
Watch what you say.

1115
01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.719
I will.

1116
01:03:35.719 --> 01:03:37.659
I'll drop her off near the company.

1117
01:03:37.819 --> 01:03:40.790
Don't. It'll be in vain...

1118
01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:42.159
if you're spotted.

1119
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:44.460
I'll take a taxi.

1120
01:03:44.699 --> 01:03:46.299
Just for two weeks.

1121
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:48.299
I'll get you a car if I can.

1122
01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:52.400
It's fine. I took buses and the subway until now.

1123
01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.639
Eun Seok.

1124
01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:56.339
Okay, then.

1125
01:03:56.639 --> 01:03:58.980
Then I'll be off to work.

1126
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:11.360
What if your bosses tell you to wipe their bottoms?

1127
01:04:11.819 --> 01:04:14.690
- Would you do it? - I'll do it...

1128
01:04:15.159 --> 01:04:16.830
if that makes me a regular employee.

1129
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.330
Besides, what do you mean by "us"?

1130
01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:19.330
We all have temp jobs here.

1131
01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:21.830
We can't be a group. That's how we'll survive.

1132
01:04:26.854 --> 01:04:31.854
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1133
01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.310
We promised to transfer...

1134
01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:38.319
a few contract workers to regular employees, right?

1135
01:04:38.719 --> 01:04:40.920
I think we got penalized for not doing so.

1136
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:44.460
Then will one of the contract workers...

1137
01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:45.889
rejoin our team?

1138
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.190
Isn't it obvious?

1139
01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.889
I don't know.

1140
01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:51.060
One of them might come back.

1141
01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:54.869
Or we might end up with another seat to fill.

1142
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.739
Whoever joins will be below me.

1143
01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.040
Then am I no longer the rookie?

1144
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:02.909
If a contract worker were to come back...

1145
01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:05.110
What if it's Seo Ji An?

1146
01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:08.449
It's not her.

1147
01:05:08.449 --> 01:05:10.650
She changed her number and disappeared.

1148
01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:11.880
She probably went somewhere else.

1149
01:05:12.319 --> 01:05:13.319
Good morning.

1150
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

1151
01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.489
How did the funeral go?

1152
01:05:16.989 --> 01:05:20.119
Right. Thank you all for coming to the funeral.

1153
01:05:20.219 --> 01:05:22.790
Sir, I heard about a new regular employee.

1154
01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:24.100
Who is it?

1155
01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:25.860
A new regular employee?

1156
01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.529
Actually, each department...

1157
01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:57.500
Hello.

1158
01:05:57.929 --> 01:05:59.929
I'm newly appointed to Haesung Apparel...

1159
01:06:00.199 --> 01:06:01.869
Marketing Team.

1160
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.770
My name is Seo Ji An.

1161
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.670
Nice to meet you.
