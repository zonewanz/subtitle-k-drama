00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:09.471
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:10.112 --> 00:00:12.641
You'll all remember the scene in "A Better Tomorrow"...

3
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:15.512
in which Chow Yun-fat fights with a matchstick in his mouth.

4
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:17.722
You'll also remember...

5
00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.951
the irreplaceable look Leslie Cheung had in his eyes...

6
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:21.852
when he met his ex-girlfriend...

7
00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:23.152
in the movie, "Moonlight Express".

8
00:00:23.652 --> 00:00:25.021
Do you remember the movie, "City of Glass"?

9
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:27.532
Do you remember the place where Li Ming and Shu Qi...

10
00:00:27.591 --> 00:00:29.161
met to confirm their love?

11
00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:31.562
These all happened at this place.

12
00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:34.071
Today, for "Heo Ji Woong's Healing for You",

13
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:35.971
we're at the shrine...

14
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.441
of Hong Kong movies, "Victoria Peak".

15
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.742
It's so pretty.

16
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.342
Do you have tissues?

17
00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:45.882
Do you think I'm here by myself?

18
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:48.681
I wouldn't have come here by myself when it's so hot like this.

19
00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.382
- Is it a big one? - Yes.

20
00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:53.552
Gosh.

21
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:57.821
I had to ask the staff many times to make sure she was the real guest.

22
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.092
I heard President Jang drank alone last night.

23
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:04.602
He has a lot to deal with.

24
00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:08.671
Everyone, it's the best actress in Korea.

25
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:10.431
Here's Sa Jin Jin.

26
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.612
- Hello. - Welcome.

27
00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:16.511
- It's nice to meet you. - Please introduce yourself.

28
00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:20.552
Hello, I'm Sa Jin Jin. It's nice to meet you.

29
00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:32.862
National Chemical. Let us take this.

30
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:34.992
I'll make sure that you won't regret it.

31
00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:36.791
Chemical?

32
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:40.701
Don't you know that it's the worst choice?

33
00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:43.632
Can you see your lack in judgment?

34
00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:45.571
You can be the judge of it later.

35
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.841
It's a little hard to hand over Chemical over to you.

36
00:01:49.472 --> 00:01:52.882
I need an approval from the board and shareholders' voting.

37
00:01:52.882 --> 00:01:55.311
The market will be suspicious as well.

38
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:58.752
I already took care of the board as well as the hedge fund managers.

39
00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:00.722
Also, the institution investors.

40
00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:04.662
Besides, about the shareholders' meeting,

41
00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:07.332
you do understand that we're the largest holder after all.

42
00:02:07.332 --> 00:02:10.531
Okay, let me think about that.

43
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.031
Thank you, Mr. Li Ka-shing.

44
00:02:13.302 --> 00:02:16.431
Well, I'm not happy with this meeting.

45
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.612
I apologize if I came across too...

46
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:23.012
aggressive today.

47
00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:24.612
No, it's not that.

48
00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.651
I heard that you're going back to Korea.

49
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:28.681
Yes.

50
00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:30.781
I'm going back home.

51
00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:36.691
(Hannuri Women's Hospital)

52
00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:41.862
- We'll start the anesthesia. - Wait a minute, doctor.

53
00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:43.161
I'm listening.

54
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:46.462
I slept for 20 hours yesterday. If anesthesia doesn't work...

55
00:02:46.462 --> 00:02:48.431
That won't happen. Breathe deeply.

56
00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:51.941
Doctor, if I wake up in the middle of the operation...

57
00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:55.142
You won't wake up. Count up to 10.

58
00:02:55.142 --> 00:02:56.242
Okay.

59
00:02:58.242 --> 00:02:59.411
One.

60
00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:04.552
Where are you going?

61
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.422
- My water broke. - What?

62
00:03:07.422 --> 00:03:08.892
Are you okay?

63
00:03:08.892 --> 00:03:12.022
(Labor Room)

64
00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:16.762
(Atlantic Ocean Law Firm)

65
00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:20.302
Unfortunately, we won't be able to hire you.

66
00:03:20.302 --> 00:03:21.401
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:43.822
Park Young Gyu's case seems difficult.

68
00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:44.992
Why?

69
00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:48.561
The judge seems to be supportive of the prosecutors.

70
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.561
Providing a witness will convince the judge.

71
00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:55.001
- Do your best for the next trial. - Okay.

72
00:03:58.441 --> 00:03:59.941
Is that you, Young Shim?

73
00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:03.371
- Hey, Ji Young. - I can't believe it.

74
00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:06.512
- We were in the same class. - I see.

75
00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:08.952
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

76
00:04:08.952 --> 00:04:10.822
- Likewise. - Have you been well?

77
00:04:10.822 --> 00:04:12.751
- Yes. - What brings you here?

78
00:04:13.992 --> 00:04:17.051
- Are you here for an interview? - Yes.

79
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:19.421
They'll hire a lot this year.

80
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:22.192
I hope things work out for you.

81
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:23.731
Yes.

82
00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:33.872
Friends? I have two friends.

83
00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:35.611
We grew up in the same neighborhood.

84
00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:40.382
Do you have any close friends among celebrities?

85
00:04:40.812 --> 00:04:42.911
Well, I don't think so.

86
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.252
Even if you aren't close,

87
00:04:44.252 --> 00:04:46.921
do you eat out or talk on the phone with any celebrity?

88
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:49.351
- No, I don't. - Is that so?

89
00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:51.562
(We got in contact.)

90
00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:52.991
Oh, right.

91
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:55.832
There's someone who wants to be close to you.

92
00:04:55.832 --> 00:04:58.101
She claims to be getting closer...

93
00:04:58.101 --> 00:04:59.932
to you at the moment.

94
00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:02.332
We prepared a video call.

95
00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:05.072
Our crew members will set it up.

96
00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:08.312
- Can you guess who it is? - No.

97
00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:11.182
Is that so? She can't guess who it is.

98
00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:13.041
Let's call her.

99
00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:16.312
We're trying to connect with her.

100
00:05:17.452 --> 00:05:18.682
Hello?

101
00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:20.351
Hello?

102
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:23.822
Hello?

103
00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:27.791
- Hello? - Hello?

104
00:05:28.192 --> 00:05:30.161
Oh, it's her.

105
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:31.861
Guess who I am.

106
00:05:34.272 --> 00:05:37.442
Hello, this is Jeong Da Yeong.

107
00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:41.171
She's the hottest rising star, Jeong Da Yeong.

108
00:05:41.272 --> 00:05:43.772
How do you know each other?

109
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:47.012
I met her once during a commercial shoot.

110
00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:48.712
Is that so?

111
00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:52.252
Yes, but I feel like we're best friends.

112
00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:56.421
She's my own Cassiopeia.

113
00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:59.022
- Cassiopeia? - Yes.

114
00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:04.002
It's the guide to Polaris in the sky.

115
00:06:04.002 --> 00:06:06.601
She's a guide in my life.

116
00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:07.772
I see.

117
00:06:07.772 --> 00:06:10.171
You haven't greeted each other.

118
00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:11.301
That's right.

119
00:06:11.741 --> 00:06:15.442
- Hello, Jin Jin. - Hello, Da Yeong.

120
00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:19.911
I wanted to ask you for an advice.

121
00:06:21.082 --> 00:06:22.952
How old are you?

122
00:06:24.082 --> 00:06:25.382
I'm 35.

123
00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:28.122
You're more like my teacher.

124
00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:29.952
You look so young.

125
00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:33.392
Since you're older and more experienced than me,

126
00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:35.432
you'll listen to my concern, right?

127
00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:38.932
What's your concern?

128
00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:41.832
There's been a gossip that...

129
00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:45.072
I'm dating an idol singer.

130
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:47.372
How should I deal with such gossip?

131
00:06:48.312 --> 00:06:51.212
There was a gossip about you and Teo...

132
00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:53.611
whom you worked with recently.

133
00:06:54.752 --> 00:06:58.281
You broke up with someone who became an alcoholic afterwards.

134
00:06:58.682 --> 00:07:00.281
- That was... - Oh, right.

135
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:03.452
There was a scandal about you and a politician.

136
00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:06.122
Wasn't there a 27-year difference in age?

137
00:07:06.122 --> 00:07:08.692
The politician's wife pulled you by the hair at a film set.

138
00:07:08.692 --> 00:07:11.361
- All of that is... - You also got surgery...

139
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:14.272
All right, Da Yeong.

140
00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:20.241
Goodness.

141
00:07:20.442 --> 00:07:21.541
Gosh.

142
00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:23.812
- Is that so, Da Yeong? - Pardon me?

143
00:07:27.882 --> 00:07:28.981
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:31.752
- It can't be aired, can it? - Of course not.

145
00:07:31.752 --> 00:07:34.791
I'm sorry. I was being careless since I'm new.

146
00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:35.921
Da Yeong.

147
00:07:37.462 --> 00:07:40.421
Do you want to know how to deal with gossip?

148
00:07:40.531 --> 00:07:41.692
Yes.

149
00:07:41.692 --> 00:07:43.291
Oh, my goodness.

150
00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:50.132
I can't do this.

151
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:53.272
We'll tell you once we deal with it.

152
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.642
- Thank you. - Thank you.

153
00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.582
Have you lost your mind?

154
00:08:04.582 --> 00:08:06.921
- What about you? - Don't you understand?

155
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:09.351
You're a sexy star in melodrama movies.

156
00:08:09.452 --> 00:08:11.022
Don't you worry about your reputation?

157
00:08:11.762 --> 00:08:14.791
Why did you say that? Were you trying to brag?

158
00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:16.462
You told me not to be fake.

159
00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:18.231
Since when did you listen to me?

160
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.932
You're right. Why should I now?

161
00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:22.171
You contacted Da Yeong on video call.

162
00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:25.442
What? What are you talking about?

163
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:28.041
My stomach hurts.

164
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.642
- Forget it. - Forget it yourself.

165
00:08:30.841 --> 00:08:33.582
Nothing can be aired. We have to edit everything.

166
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:35.111
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

167
00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:38.682
- Mi Dal, give me some tissue. - You used all of it.

168
00:08:38.682 --> 00:08:39.881
What?

169
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:42.091
Darn it.

170
00:08:42.552 --> 00:08:43.792
Goodness.

171
00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:48.462
What a mess.

172
00:08:49.032 --> 00:08:52.131
Producer Park. Please cut this out.

173
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:54.172
This can't be aired.

174
00:08:54.172 --> 00:08:57.371
I'm sorry. I beg you. Please help me.

175
00:08:57.371 --> 00:08:59.371
That can't be aired anyway.

176
00:08:59.471 --> 00:09:02.172
Sir, please delete everything.

177
00:09:02.172 --> 00:09:04.442
We'll be in trouble if it gets aired.

178
00:09:04.442 --> 00:09:07.082
I'm sorry. I beg you, please?

179
00:09:13.121 --> 00:09:15.021
She needs to fast for now.

180
00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:17.192
Once she expels gas tomorrow morning,

181
00:09:17.192 --> 00:09:20.932
she may eat porridge after drinking water.

182
00:09:21.292 --> 00:09:23.231
Your surgery went well, so don't worry.

183
00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:24.962
Thank you, doctor.

184
00:09:24.962 --> 00:09:26.802
- Please get some rest. - Thank you.

185
00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:39.011
- Mom. - Are you awake?

186
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:41.952
- Who was he? - He was your surgeon.

187
00:09:42.412 --> 00:09:45.152
Your doctor went into labor.

188
00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:49.851
- Mom. - What's wrong? Are you in pain?

189
00:09:50.351 --> 00:09:51.861
I'm hungry.

190
00:10:06.402 --> 00:10:08.871
Why are there two models for the makeup?

191
00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:10.542
Is President Jang behind it?

192
00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:12.542
He may offer it to Jeong Da Yeong.

193
00:10:13.282 --> 00:10:15.152
What do you think of Jeong Da Yeong?

194
00:10:15.552 --> 00:10:18.582
Hello, this is Jeong Da Yeong.

195
00:10:18.582 --> 00:10:20.351
You're right. Why should I now?

196
00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:22.591
You contacted Da Yeong on video call.

197
00:10:29.162 --> 00:10:30.902
Do you mean tomorrow?

198
00:10:32.302 --> 00:10:34.072
Shall we leave with you tomorrow?

199
00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:38.841
Okay. Bye.

200
00:10:41.212 --> 00:10:42.312
President Jang.

201
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:46.412
Jin Jin wants to change the ticket to tomorrow.

202
00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:48.251
She wants to stay with Mi Dal.

203
00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.422
She told us to leave.

204
00:10:51.422 --> 00:10:53.351
Otherwise, she'll run away.

205
00:10:56.552 --> 00:10:58.361
- Change it. - President Jang.

206
00:10:59.662 --> 00:11:02.162
I think there's a misunderstanding.

207
00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:05.501
Maybe you should talk to her.

208
00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:08.001
How can I bring her back if she isn't interested?

209
00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:13.471
Let's go.

210
00:11:14.212 --> 00:11:15.271
Where to?

211
00:11:16.172 --> 00:11:17.442
I'm hungry.

212
00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:23.111
That's so beautiful.

213
00:11:23.481 --> 00:11:24.922
Look over there.

214
00:11:25.922 --> 00:11:27.591
Let's take a photo.

215
00:11:27.591 --> 00:11:32.162
- Ready? 1, 2, 3. - Tada.

216
00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:34.032
- Wow. - It's lovely.

217
00:11:34.032 --> 00:11:35.962
1, 2, 3.

218
00:11:35.962 --> 00:11:37.361
- Again. - 1, 2, 3.

219
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:42.631
1, 2, 3.

220
00:11:44.072 --> 00:11:45.402
You look too pretty.

221
00:11:45.402 --> 00:11:46.942
- I don't. - I'll lean back.

222
00:11:46.942 --> 00:11:48.511
1, 2, 3.

223
00:11:57.322 --> 00:11:58.682
You look angry.

224
00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:00.851
Jin Jin, look over there.

225
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:05.861
This is great. I'm having so much fun.

226
00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:07.121
Jin Jin.

227
00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:09.962
- Nice. - Let's have a look.

228
00:12:09.962 --> 00:12:12.402
Try this on. Shall we get the same thing?

229
00:12:27.552 --> 00:12:29.111
This one.

230
00:12:29.212 --> 00:12:30.851
1. 1, please.

231
00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:46.062
Yes, this is it.

232
00:12:48.672 --> 00:12:50.542
Tiger balm. Tiger balm.

233
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.611
- You really need to buy these. - Leave these out.

234
00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:57.981
- These too. - What?

235
00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.282
How much is it?

236
00:13:03.381 --> 00:13:05.822
Gyu Ri, Yoo Young,

237
00:13:05.822 --> 00:13:08.221
Uncle Sang Gil, Mokdong aunt...

238
00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:09.422
Mi Dal.

239
00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:11.021
Are you opening a shop?

240
00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.121
I need to get more gifts.

241
00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:17.231
I don't think this will do. I'll go and get some more.

242
00:13:19.501 --> 00:13:20.601
Use this.

243
00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:23.471
I love you, Jin Jin.

244
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:26.501
Watch them. I won't be long.

245
00:13:26.942 --> 00:13:28.212
Yes. Thanks.

246
00:13:38.236 --> 00:13:41.468
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E02 20th Century Boy & Girl "Sex Tape"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

247
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.131
Oh, right. Shall I show you something fun?

248
00:13:54.202 --> 00:13:56.572
I saw Sa Jin Jin earlier today.

249
00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:00.712
How do you know each other?

250
00:14:01.212 --> 00:14:04.542
We met once while shooting a commercial.

251
00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:19.391
Doesn't that sound like a lie?

252
00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:21.832
She wouldn't lie about that.

253
00:14:22.662 --> 00:14:23.731
What?

254
00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.131
Why act like you know her?

255
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:41.212
Jin Jin, I'm done.

256
00:15:41.212 --> 00:15:43.371
- Are you really? - I bought a lot.

257
00:15:43.471 --> 00:15:45.641
Let's go now. Come on.

258
00:15:51.152 --> 00:15:52.782
Let's grab that taxi.

259
00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:25.721
- My bag. - You don't have it?

260
00:16:25.721 --> 00:16:26.952
Oh no.

261
00:16:36.731 --> 00:16:38.702
- It's not here. - No?

262
00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:41.471
Oh no.

263
00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:45.442
Call your bank first.

264
00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.542
I still have a lot of the money you gave me.

265
00:16:56.812 --> 00:16:58.621
- Good morning. - Check-out.

266
00:16:59.282 --> 00:17:03.052
Room number 3202, Jin Jin Sa?

267
00:17:03.792 --> 00:17:04.821
Yes.

268
00:17:04.821 --> 00:17:07.162
Someone told me to give you this last night.

269
00:17:13.561 --> 00:17:15.432
It's all here.

270
00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:17.172
Her passport.

271
00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:31.622
Jin Jin.

272
00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:36.721
Jin Jin.

273
00:17:37.692 --> 00:17:38.821
Jin Jin.

274
00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:53.672
- Is there any more? - No.

275
00:17:56.642 --> 00:17:58.981
Hey, that doctor.

276
00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:01.352
He looked so handsome.

277
00:18:01.751 --> 00:18:04.281
He had this aura surrounding him.

278
00:18:04.281 --> 00:18:05.751
So what about it?

279
00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.422
Can't I even talk about him?

280
00:18:08.352 --> 00:18:10.051
I bet he's taken.

281
00:18:10.892 --> 00:18:13.692
All the good ones have partners now.

282
00:18:13.862 --> 00:18:15.962
Only the defects like you are left.

283
00:18:22.172 --> 00:18:23.202
What?

284
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:26.571
Boss!

285
00:18:27.842 --> 00:18:30.041
Boss. Boss.

286
00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:32.412
- What's the fuss? - Jin Jin...

287
00:18:40.852 --> 00:18:42.321
Do you have my passport?

288
00:18:45.261 --> 00:18:48.092
Yes. Your passport's here and so is your wallet.

289
00:18:48.432 --> 00:18:50.831
- Did you call Hong Hee? - Yes, he'll be waiting.

290
00:19:01.142 --> 00:19:03.642
The caller cannot be reached.

291
00:19:04.682 --> 00:19:05.842
No answer.

292
00:19:18.122 --> 00:19:19.462
Hi, Mr. Gong.

293
00:19:19.962 --> 00:19:23.592
Your flight is the 1:35pm flight from Hong Kong to Incheon.

294
00:19:23.592 --> 00:19:26.001
- The boarding hour is 1pm. - All right.

295
00:19:26.261 --> 00:19:27.501
Please hold on.

296
00:19:34.142 --> 00:19:36.541
Excuse me, sir. My apologies.

297
00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:39.182
The flight is delayed due to weather conditions.

298
00:19:39.281 --> 00:19:41.212
It'll be delayed for about an hour.

299
00:19:43.011 --> 00:19:45.781
Okay. Thanks anyway.

300
00:19:51.422 --> 00:19:55.561
Oh no. Why did these all fall out?

301
00:20:22.791 --> 00:20:26.592
(Bed scene)

302
00:20:43.912 --> 00:20:45.241
Those breasts.

303
00:20:45.712 --> 00:20:47.251
Those hips.

304
00:20:47.382 --> 00:20:50.051
The voice is totally Sa Jin Jin too.

305
00:20:50.581 --> 00:20:52.182
Down to the mole by her eye.

306
00:20:57.622 --> 00:20:58.761
Yes, Reporter Yoon.

307
00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.791
No, of course not.

308
00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:05.031
But Jin Jin is coming back from Hong Kong.

309
00:21:06.102 --> 00:21:08.632
It's not possible. Of course not.

310
00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:13.672
Gosh!

311
00:21:15.842 --> 00:21:18.712
- Find out who that man is. - Sorry?

312
00:21:18.712 --> 00:21:20.751
We have to make sure.

313
00:21:21.852 --> 00:21:25.251
Here, look. Isn't this so cool?

314
00:21:25.251 --> 00:21:26.481
What is this?

315
00:21:26.481 --> 00:21:29.452
- It's the best so far. - Sa Jin Jin. Sa Jin Jin.

316
00:21:29.452 --> 00:21:30.592
Sa Jin...

317
00:21:30.592 --> 00:21:33.192
- Sa Jin Jin. - This is so cool.

318
00:21:33.192 --> 00:21:35.132
- I didn't know she was this great. - Gosh.

319
00:21:35.132 --> 00:21:36.692
- She's so pretty. - This is so cool.

320
00:21:36.692 --> 00:21:38.362
- Look at her body. - Send it to me.

321
00:21:38.362 --> 00:21:39.702
It's 6 dollars and 30 cents.

322
00:21:39.702 --> 00:21:41.501
- Send it to me. - Here.

323
00:21:42.202 --> 00:21:43.842
Hurry up. Send it to me.

324
00:21:43.842 --> 00:21:44.902
I did.

325
00:21:44.902 --> 00:21:47.342
- Gosh. - Gosh.

326
00:21:47.672 --> 00:21:49.571
- This is unbelievable. - She's so pretty.

327
00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:50.842
Look at her body.

328
00:21:55.081 --> 00:21:56.182
Sir,

329
00:21:56.852 --> 00:21:58.622
should I call your wife?

330
00:21:58.622 --> 00:22:00.321
No.

331
00:22:01.051 --> 00:22:02.251
Don't.

332
00:22:09.531 --> 00:22:10.702
Mom.

333
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:22.741
The plane will be arriving soon.

334
00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:23.811
She's not coming.

335
00:22:23.811 --> 00:22:26.712
- Maybe she went the other way. - Maybe.

336
00:22:26.712 --> 00:22:28.281
She won't come this way.

Gosh.

This is driving me crazy.

343
00:22:47.902 --> 00:22:49.731
Gosh.

(Ah Reum)

345
00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:16.962

"Gosh, is this Sa Jin Jin?"

349
00:23:24.642 --> 00:23:26.442
She doesn't even know how to multiply.

350
00:23:26.902 --> 00:23:29.212
How would she know calculus?

351

- Ms. Han Ah Reum? - Yes?

352

Your vitals are normal,

Yes, I had some porridge.

355
00:23:40.852 --> 00:23:43.221
If you feel better, you should go out for a walk.

Did you?

364
00:24:11.551 --> 00:24:13.892
Yes, I did.

No, he didn't tell me anything.

376

You shouldn't take pictures!

You recognized me. How have you been?
