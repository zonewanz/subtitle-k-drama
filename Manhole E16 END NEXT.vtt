(Last Episode)

2
00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:15.553
Well, I...

3
00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:23.792
What is it? Is there something outside?

4
00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:26.193
No, it's nothing.

5
00:00:38.473 --> 00:00:40.842
Let's call it a day. You must be tired.

6
00:00:41.113 --> 00:00:42.113
Right.

7
00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.683
Jae Hyun, you should wash up first.

8
00:00:44.683 --> 00:00:47.022
I'll get changed.

9
00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:51.623
Why?

10
00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:54.793
Are you trying to run away from me again?

11
00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:56.632
What?

12
00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:04.073
Don't ever run away from me again, Soo Jin.

13
00:01:04.903 --> 00:01:07.172
I'll find you no matter where you are.

14
00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:12.543
Okay?

15
00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:15.942
Okay.

16
00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:23.052
What is that?

17
00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:52.082
Soo Jin, let's go.

18
00:02:24.052 --> 00:02:25.052
Pil!

19
00:02:26.582 --> 00:02:27.582
Soo Jin!

20
00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:29.152
Soo Jin.

21
00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:00.622
Soo Jin.

22
00:03:01.552 --> 00:03:03.353
Soo Jin, are you all right?

23
00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.332
Soo Jin, pull it together.

24
00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:49.663
Pil.

25
00:03:56.742 --> 00:03:57.742
Pil.

26
00:03:59.612 --> 00:04:00.612
No.

27
00:04:03.212 --> 00:04:04.212
No.

28
00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:08.483
Pil, stay with me.

29
00:04:09.152 --> 00:04:10.223
Pil.

30
00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:11.952
No.

31
00:04:13.022 --> 00:04:14.593
Open your eyes.

32
00:04:15.563 --> 00:04:16.663
Pil.

33
00:04:18.192 --> 00:04:21.132
Gosh, why wouldn't Mr. Bong pick up?

34
00:04:21.163 --> 00:04:24.233
Your call cannot be connected at the moment.

35
00:04:24.233 --> 00:04:26.603
What did the detective say? Did he find Jae Hyun?

36
00:04:26.603 --> 00:04:29.703
Yes, his phone is on, so he located him.

37
00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:31.413
Police officers nearby...

38
00:04:31.413 --> 00:04:33.182
are headed over to his location.

39
00:04:33.182 --> 00:04:34.713
Thank goodness.

40
00:04:34.742 --> 00:04:36.112
Anyway, what happened to Mr. Bong?

41
00:04:36.112 --> 00:04:38.953
He said he was going after Jae Hyun.

42
00:04:39.822 --> 00:04:41.322
Oh, no.

43
00:04:42.853 --> 00:04:44.492
You're bleeding too much.

44
00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:50.562
I'm fine.

45
00:04:54.432 --> 00:04:55.603
Where's Jae Hyun?

46
00:04:58.033 --> 00:04:59.632
I think he ran away.

47
00:05:00.403 --> 00:05:01.403
But forget about him.

48
00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:04.012
I need to get you to a hospital.

49
00:05:04.442 --> 00:05:07.043
Your cell phone. Where's your phone?

50
00:05:09.483 --> 00:05:11.612
No, I'll get it.

51
00:05:20.422 --> 00:05:21.422
Hello?

52
00:05:23.132 --> 00:05:25.393
Hello? Isn't this Mr. Bong's phone?

53
00:05:26.163 --> 00:05:27.903
Wait, are you Ms. Kang Soo Jin?

54
00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:29.533
Yes.

55
00:05:29.703 --> 00:05:31.833
I'm Kang Soo Jin.

56
00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:34.802
Is Mr. Bong with you?

57
00:05:34.802 --> 00:05:36.103
What about Park Jae Hyun?

58
00:05:36.713 --> 00:05:38.143
Jae Hyun...

59
00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:40.312
stabbed Pil...

60
00:05:41.012 --> 00:05:42.812
with a knife and ran away.

61
00:05:42.812 --> 00:05:43.812
What?

62
00:05:44.713 --> 00:05:46.983
Pil's badly hurt right now.

63
00:05:48.023 --> 00:05:49.523
Yes, all right.

64
00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:51.593
I'll send an ambulance over immediately.

65
00:05:52.192 --> 00:05:53.362
Mr. Shin.

66
00:05:53.622 --> 00:05:55.393
Mr. Bong has been stabbed with a knife.

67
00:05:55.393 --> 00:05:57.192
Send an ambulance to Haneul Lake. Hurry.

68
00:05:57.192 --> 00:05:58.562
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:58.562 --> 00:06:00.533
Goodness, they are driving me crazy.

70
00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:04.473
Hello, this is Bora Patrol Division.

71
00:06:04.502 --> 00:06:06.742
Park Jae Hyun has stabbed Mr. Bong,

72
00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:08.002
and he's on the run right now.

73
00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:09.742
You should hurry.

74
00:06:11.372 --> 00:06:13.213
Park Jae Hyun is on the run right now.

75
00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:14.442
Let's hurry.

76
00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:15.612
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:18.953 --> 00:06:20.723
That's his car.

78
00:06:20.882 --> 00:06:22.283
- Follow him. - Yes.

79
00:06:42.072 --> 00:06:43.112
Step on it.

80
00:06:50.812 --> 00:06:51.812
Pil.

81
00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:53.853
Hang on, okay?

82
00:06:54.723 --> 00:06:56.953
An ambulance will be here any minute now.

83
00:06:57.422 --> 00:06:59.793
Everything will be fine.

84
00:07:00.163 --> 00:07:01.223
Soo Jin.

85
00:07:02.362 --> 00:07:04.132
Did you get hurt?

86
00:07:09.632 --> 00:07:10.872
I'm fine.

87
00:07:13.572 --> 00:07:15.002
I'm sorry, Pil.

88
00:07:16.742 --> 00:07:18.973
Only if I hadn't turned on my phone,

89
00:07:20.713 --> 00:07:22.583
you wouldn't be here.

90
00:07:24.612 --> 00:07:27.023
And you wouldn't have gotten injured.

91
00:07:28.922 --> 00:07:30.223
It's all because of me.

92
00:07:32.353 --> 00:07:33.422
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.333
Don't say that.

94
00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:40.932
Even if you didn't do that,

95
00:07:42.603 --> 00:07:44.802
I would've found you no matter what.

96
00:07:49.273 --> 00:07:50.773
I knew you would do this.

97
00:07:53.442 --> 00:07:56.283
This is why I said I wouldn't see you anymore.

98
00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:01.353
I wanted to stop seeing you...

99
00:08:01.353 --> 00:08:03.692
because I didn't want you to suffer because of me.

100
00:08:07.062 --> 00:08:09.262
But I did this to you again.

101
00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:14.703
If I couldn't save you,

102
00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:21.703
I would've resented myself for the rest of my life.

103
00:08:25.742 --> 00:08:27.413
That would've been harder for me.

104
00:08:29.483 --> 00:08:30.552
Pil.

105
00:09:00.683 --> 00:09:01.943
Stop right there!

106
00:09:03.813 --> 00:09:04.813
Darn it.

107
00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.522
- We finally got him. - Let go of me!

108
00:09:11.392 --> 00:09:13.423
- Darn you. - Stop moving.

109
00:09:13.622 --> 00:09:14.622
Let go!

110
00:09:14.693 --> 00:09:15.892
(Emergency Response)

111
00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:19.862
Stand up.

112
00:09:24.703 --> 00:09:26.002
Pil, stay with me.

113
00:09:26.642 --> 00:09:27.703
Pil.

114
00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:32.673
The stars are very pretty.

115
00:09:37.713 --> 00:09:39.152
They are.

116
00:09:43.193 --> 00:09:44.252
Soo Jin.

117
00:09:47.762 --> 00:09:49.833
When I was traveling through time,

118
00:09:51.492 --> 00:09:52.693
at first,

119
00:09:56.103 --> 00:09:57.803
I thought...

120
00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:00.843
all I need was you.

121
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:03.713
But...

122
00:10:06.412 --> 00:10:08.083
in the end...

123
00:10:13.353 --> 00:10:14.353
I realized...

124
00:10:16.553 --> 00:10:18.423
that your happiness...

125
00:10:20.122 --> 00:10:21.492
was most important.

126
00:10:23.862 --> 00:10:24.963
Pil.

127
00:10:25.733 --> 00:10:27.103
When you smile,

128
00:10:28.703 --> 00:10:30.372
I can smile.

129
00:10:33.843 --> 00:10:36.042
When you're happy, I'm happy.

130
00:10:38.713 --> 00:10:39.813
So...

131
00:10:41.843 --> 00:10:43.583
you have to be happy.

132
00:10:45.252 --> 00:10:47.553
That way I can be happy.

133
00:10:49.723 --> 00:10:50.823
All right?

134
00:10:50.992 --> 00:10:52.022
Hey.

135
00:10:52.823 --> 00:10:55.022
Why do you say it like this is the end?

136
00:10:56.492 --> 00:10:57.492
I...

137
00:10:58.093 --> 00:10:59.662
will never...

138
00:11:00.762 --> 00:11:02.362
leave your side.

139
00:11:03.573 --> 00:11:05.473
Even if you say you hate me,

140
00:11:05.902 --> 00:11:07.642
I won't leave you.

141
00:11:08.742 --> 00:11:10.272
So don't die.

142
00:11:11.673 --> 00:11:14.183
Please live and be with me.

143
00:11:14.443 --> 00:11:15.542
Okay?

144
00:11:17.012 --> 00:11:18.112
Soo Jin.

145
00:11:22.622 --> 00:11:24.423
Even if I die,

146
00:11:27.063 --> 00:11:29.693
don't think that I'm not with you.

147
00:11:32.433 --> 00:11:34.762
Even when you didn't remember,

148
00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:40.242
I was always by your side.

149
00:11:42.443 --> 00:11:44.073
Whatever you do,

150
00:11:45.813 --> 00:11:47.382
wherever you are,

151
00:11:52.583 --> 00:11:54.122
I...

152
00:11:56.022 --> 00:11:57.953
will always be by your side.

153
00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:00.262
Why do you keep saying that?

154
00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:02.892
Pil.

155
00:12:04.233 --> 00:12:08.203
I still have so much to tell you.

156
00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:13.103
There's still so much I haven't done for you.

157
00:12:14.542 --> 00:12:16.573
I can't let you go like this.

158
00:12:17.213 --> 00:12:19.313
I can never let you go, Pil.

159
00:12:30.752 --> 00:12:31.892
Soo Jin.

160
00:12:33.093 --> 00:12:34.223
I...

161
00:12:36.762 --> 00:12:38.833
can't see your face.

162
00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:43.303
No.

163
00:12:45.502 --> 00:12:46.573
Soo Jin,

164
00:12:51.713 --> 00:12:53.483
I have to see you.

165
00:12:57.553 --> 00:12:58.713
Soo Jin.

166
00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:05.252
I have to see you.

167
00:13:27.343 --> 00:13:28.412
Pil.

168
00:13:31.713 --> 00:13:32.782
Pil.

169
00:13:35.522 --> 00:13:36.723
Pil, open your eyes.

170
00:13:39.323 --> 00:13:40.593
Pil, open your eyes.

171
00:13:43.433 --> 00:13:44.593
Pil, no.

172
00:13:46.262 --> 00:13:47.303
Pil.

173
00:13:49.733 --> 00:13:51.073
Pil.

174
00:13:59.412 --> 00:14:00.443
Pil.

175
00:14:02.742 --> 00:14:03.782
Pil.

176
00:14:06.453 --> 00:14:07.483
Pil.

177
00:14:08.983 --> 00:14:10.823
I can't give up on you.

178
00:14:12.423 --> 00:14:14.622
So don't give up.

179
00:14:27.872 --> 00:14:28.973
Pil.

180
00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:32.573
I love you.

181
00:14:33.683 --> 00:14:34.713
Pil.

182
00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:05.173
(Present, Soo Jin's wedding day)

183
00:15:05.173 --> 00:15:07.983
Thunder stealer.

184
00:15:28.733 --> 00:15:29.733
Hey.

185
00:15:29.733 --> 00:15:32.103
Why are you sleeping while getting your make up done?

186
00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:35.272
She probably didn't get any sleep last night.

187
00:15:35.272 --> 00:15:36.943
Oh, you.

188
00:15:38.542 --> 00:15:39.542
Jung Ae.

189
00:15:40.843 --> 00:15:43.012
What am I doing here?

190
00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:44.683
Are you still half asleep?

191
00:15:44.683 --> 00:15:46.652
You were getting your makeup done.

192
00:15:47.382 --> 00:15:48.782
Makeup?

193
00:15:51.593 --> 00:15:53.323
Am I getting married today?

194
00:15:54.823 --> 00:15:58.292
Are you getting cold feet?

195
00:15:58.292 --> 00:16:00.433
Soo Jin, are you having a hard time...

196
00:16:00.433 --> 00:16:02.132
accepting the reality of marriage?

197
00:16:03.032 --> 00:16:04.803
It's okay.

198
00:16:09.272 --> 00:16:11.713
Pil. Where's Pil?

199
00:16:11.713 --> 00:16:13.713
I don't know. He must be drunk somewhere.

200
00:16:13.713 --> 00:16:16.683
Goodness. Your makeup is amazing.

201
00:16:16.683 --> 00:16:17.813
I knew you were pretty,

202
00:16:17.813 --> 00:16:20.083
but today you're really pretty.

203
00:16:21.453 --> 00:16:24.053
I have to go see Pil.

204
00:16:24.752 --> 00:16:26.193
- Hey. - What's up with her?

205
00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:28.063
Hey, Soo Jin. Kang Soo Jin!

206
00:16:28.063 --> 00:16:29.362
Soo Jin!

207
00:16:34.463 --> 00:16:35.703
Hey, Soo Jin!

208
00:16:35.803 --> 00:16:36.872
Hey!

209
00:16:37.632 --> 00:16:39.473
- Hey, Soo Jin! - Hey.

210
00:16:39.473 --> 00:16:42.902
I don't feel like going to the wedding.

211
00:16:43.173 --> 00:16:44.713
But we have to go.

212
00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:45.772
Let's go.

213
00:16:46.483 --> 00:16:48.142
We have to at least show up.

214
00:16:48.142 --> 00:16:50.112
Do you think Pil will go to the wedding?

215
00:16:50.612 --> 00:16:52.453
He didn't come home last night.

216
00:16:52.882 --> 00:16:54.083
Where is he?

217
00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:55.083
Do you...

218
00:16:55.083 --> 00:16:57.622
think Pil would want to go to Soo Jin's wedding?

219
00:16:57.622 --> 00:16:59.593
Maybe it's better he didn't go.

220
00:16:59.593 --> 00:17:00.923
He might cause trouble...

221
00:17:01.093 --> 00:17:03.563
like he did last time.

222
00:17:03.563 --> 00:17:04.633
Pil.

223
00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:06.233
Pil.

224
00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:07.963
Soo Jin, why are you here?

225
00:17:07.963 --> 00:17:09.703
Ma'am. Where's Pil?

226
00:17:09.703 --> 00:17:12.102
- He isn't home. - What?

227
00:17:12.373 --> 00:17:14.102
Pil.

228
00:17:14.102 --> 00:17:15.473
Hey. Goodness.

229
00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:17.113
- Pil. - Well...

230
00:17:17.742 --> 00:17:19.012
- Pil. - Well...

231
00:17:21.113 --> 00:17:23.713
Ma'am. Do you know where he is right now?

232
00:17:23.713 --> 00:17:24.782
I'm not sure.

233
00:17:24.782 --> 00:17:27.183
He didn't come home last night.

234
00:17:27.183 --> 00:17:28.653
Why are you looking for him?

235
00:17:28.653 --> 00:17:30.623
You're in your wedding dress.

236
00:17:30.623 --> 00:17:31.752
Is something wrong?

237
00:17:31.752 --> 00:17:33.163
Well...

238
00:17:33.163 --> 00:17:35.393
I'll explain it to you later.

239
00:17:35.393 --> 00:17:36.562
Bye.

240
00:17:38.292 --> 00:17:39.863
She has to walk down the aisle.

241
00:17:39.863 --> 00:17:42.262
Why is she looking for Pil?

242
00:17:43.302 --> 00:17:45.473
I'm curious about that too.

243
00:17:48.203 --> 00:17:53.782
(September 28, 2018 11:40pm)

244
00:18:07.163 --> 00:18:08.262
Pil.

245
00:18:09.863 --> 00:18:11.062
Pil.

246
00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:12.532
Open your eyes.

247
00:18:12.532 --> 00:18:13.802
Hey, Pil.

248
00:18:15.102 --> 00:18:17.173
- Pil, open your eyes. - Where are you?

249
00:18:18.433 --> 00:18:20.302
- Pil. - Please show up.

250
00:18:21.842 --> 00:18:22.943
- Pil. - Pil.

251
00:18:24.242 --> 00:18:25.443
Hey, Pil.

252
00:18:55.502 --> 00:18:57.542
Doctor, the patient woke up.

253
00:18:57.542 --> 00:18:59.272
- Pil. - Where are you going?

254
00:18:59.272 --> 00:19:00.282
You can't leave.

255
00:19:00.282 --> 00:19:01.842
You have to stay in bed. This is dangerous.

256
00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:03.983
- Sir, please. - Calm down.

257
00:19:04.252 --> 00:19:05.613
- Please calm down. - Sir.

258
00:19:05.613 --> 00:19:07.683
- This is dangerous. - Sir.

259
00:19:33.312 --> 00:19:34.483
Pil.

260
00:19:35.282 --> 00:19:37.782
You're also looking for me, right?

261
00:19:39.282 --> 00:19:40.282
Soo Jin.

262
00:19:40.852 --> 00:19:42.052
I told you...

263
00:19:42.852 --> 00:19:45.423
that I'd find you wherever you are.

264
00:19:46.762 --> 00:19:48.522
That I'd always be by your side.

265
00:19:50.893 --> 00:19:54.032
Right, I can feel you.

266
00:19:54.933 --> 00:19:57.203
We're in different times,

267
00:19:57.532 --> 00:19:59.403
but we're still together.

268
00:20:00.002 --> 00:20:01.973
We're looking at the same thing.

269
00:20:04.312 --> 00:20:05.373
Soo Jin.

270
00:20:06.443 --> 00:20:08.542
Nothing can split us apart.

271
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.312
I'll go to you by any means.

272
00:20:12.153 --> 00:20:13.352
Just wait a little.

273
00:20:14.082 --> 00:20:15.082
Just a little.

274
00:20:52.123 --> 00:20:53.322
She's here.

275
00:20:53.492 --> 00:20:54.792
Soo Jin.

276
00:20:58.463 --> 00:21:01.703
Why did you come here instead of getting ready?

277
00:21:03.102 --> 00:21:04.502
I need to see Pil.

278
00:21:04.772 --> 00:21:05.772
What?

279
00:21:05.772 --> 00:21:08.742
Why are you looking for Pil on your wedding day?

280
00:21:08.742 --> 00:21:10.473
I'm sure Pil is looking for me too.

281
00:21:11.213 --> 00:21:12.913
Where on earth is he?

282
00:21:13.542 --> 00:21:15.312
What?

283
00:21:15.582 --> 00:21:17.852
Hey, come to your senses.

284
00:21:17.852 --> 00:21:19.713
Pil's whereabouts is not important.

285
00:21:19.713 --> 00:21:21.752
You might be late for your wedding. Let's hurry.

286
00:21:21.752 --> 00:21:23.292
This won't do.

287
00:21:23.292 --> 00:21:25.153
I'll get us a taxi. Bring her with you.

288
00:21:25.153 --> 00:21:26.893
- Wait. - Let's go.

289
00:21:26.893 --> 00:21:27.893
Come quick.

290
00:21:28.022 --> 00:21:29.723
- No. - What are you doing here?

291
00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:32.933
- Let's hurry. - No, I must see Pil.

292
00:21:57.623 --> 00:21:58.822
What?

293
00:21:59.092 --> 00:22:01.022
Why am I tied up?

294
00:22:01.963 --> 00:22:03.592
Darn it!

295
00:22:04.863 --> 00:22:07.502
I think it's Jin Sook's house.

296
00:22:08.233 --> 00:22:10.302
- Gosh. - You're awake.

297
00:22:11.173 --> 00:22:12.173
Hey.

298
00:22:12.403 --> 00:22:14.002
What is this?

299
00:22:14.002 --> 00:22:15.542
Can't you see?

300
00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:19.242
Don't try to pull anything silly and stay here.

301
00:22:19.373 --> 00:22:20.383
Hey.

302
00:22:20.842 --> 00:22:22.943
Jin Sook, did...

303
00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:27.022
Did we get married again?

304
00:22:27.852 --> 00:22:29.123
Are you crazy?

305
00:22:29.123 --> 00:22:30.623
Why would I marry you?

306
00:22:30.623 --> 00:22:32.153
Then what is going on?

307
00:22:32.153 --> 00:22:34.522
Why am I tied up here?

308
00:22:34.522 --> 00:22:38.092
So that you won't ruin Soo Jin's wedding.

309
00:22:38.863 --> 00:22:40.302
What?

310
00:22:41.102 --> 00:22:43.102
Soo Jin is getting married today?

311
00:22:44.102 --> 00:22:45.633
With that pharmacist by any chance?

312
00:22:45.633 --> 00:22:46.973
Are you still drunk?

313
00:22:47.072 --> 00:22:48.802
Or are you denying the reality or something?

314
00:22:50.012 --> 00:22:52.742
Where is Soo Jin then?

315
00:22:52.742 --> 00:22:55.012
Where do you think? She's at her wedding.

316
00:22:55.042 --> 00:22:57.453
Stay put like this...

317
00:22:57.453 --> 00:22:59.953
until her wedding ends, got that?

318
00:23:02.953 --> 00:23:05.223
Did Soo Jin not time travel?

319
00:23:06.792 --> 00:23:08.723
I think it's only me this time.

320
00:23:08.723 --> 00:23:10.463
Jin Sook, I'm here.

321
00:23:10.463 --> 00:23:13.532
- You're here. - Seok Tae.

322
00:23:13.762 --> 00:23:15.433
Did you tie him up properly?

323
00:23:15.433 --> 00:23:16.933
Yes, I did.

324
00:23:16.933 --> 00:23:18.602
Hey.

325
00:23:20.443 --> 00:23:22.302
Isn't this too much?

326
00:23:22.403 --> 00:23:24.443
How could you tie up your friend like this?

327
00:23:24.443 --> 00:23:26.143
We didn't do this because we wanted to.

328
00:23:26.143 --> 00:23:28.883
You kept on acting unexpectedly. That's why.

329
00:23:29.082 --> 00:23:31.352
It's a happy day for Soo Jin.

330
00:23:31.352 --> 00:23:33.423
Don't think about messing it up and stay put.

331
00:23:33.653 --> 00:23:35.052
That's how you help Soo Jin.

332
00:23:37.923 --> 00:23:39.492
Still, it's Soo Jin's wedding.

333
00:23:39.492 --> 00:23:41.723
Shouldn't I go there to congratulate her?

334
00:23:42.223 --> 00:23:44.062
I won't do anything. I swear.

335
00:23:44.062 --> 00:23:45.733
So please untie me.

336
00:23:48.433 --> 00:23:52.102
Jin Sook, I think he has a point.

337
00:23:52.272 --> 00:23:54.042
Shouldn't he go to Soo Jin's wedding?

338
00:23:54.042 --> 00:23:57.072
No, he made a scene when we delivered the gifts.

339
00:23:57.473 --> 00:23:59.983
We can't let him go. Definitely not.

340
00:23:59.983 --> 00:24:00.983
Come on.

341
00:24:01.742 --> 00:24:04.983
I'm repenting what I did that day so much.

342
00:24:05.483 --> 00:24:07.552
I won't cause a scene at her wedding.

343
00:24:07.552 --> 00:24:09.723
I'll watch her from afar.

344
00:24:10.453 --> 00:24:13.123
It's the most important day in her life.

345
00:24:13.363 --> 00:24:15.292
I really want to congratulate her.

346
00:24:18.363 --> 00:24:19.363
What should we do?

347
00:24:21.733 --> 00:24:24.272
No, we already saw what he did on the day...

348
00:24:24.373 --> 00:24:25.502
we delivered the wedding gifts.

349
00:24:25.633 --> 00:24:28.102
Seok Tae, don't be weak.

350
00:24:28.473 --> 00:24:29.473
Let's go.

351
00:24:30.913 --> 00:24:32.842
Hey, guys.

352
00:24:33.542 --> 00:24:37.282
Untie me already! Guys!

353
00:24:37.483 --> 00:24:40.483
Jin Sook, that determined brat.

354
00:24:40.582 --> 00:24:42.052
Goodness.

355
00:24:49.693 --> 00:24:52.633
Where did she go?

356
00:24:52.863 --> 00:24:54.463
The ceremony is about to begin.

357
00:24:54.463 --> 00:24:55.863
She'll be here soon.

358
00:24:56.032 --> 00:24:58.072
Let's wait a little longer.

359
00:25:00.873 --> 00:25:03.143
The bride is here.

360
00:25:07.683 --> 00:25:10.252
Soo Jin, where have you been? I was worried.

361
00:25:14.453 --> 00:25:17.022
What's wrong? Are you sick?

362
00:25:19.252 --> 00:25:22.522
Soo Jin must be nervous.

363
00:25:22.623 --> 00:25:24.992
It's okay Soo Jin. Relax.

364
00:25:26.502 --> 00:25:28.032
The ceremony will begin shortly.

365
00:25:28.032 --> 00:25:29.433
The groom needs to stand by.

366
00:25:29.433 --> 00:25:30.433
Okay.

367
00:25:32.502 --> 00:25:34.873
Don't be nervous. I'll see you soon.

368
00:25:38.473 --> 00:25:40.643
- We'll go with him. - See you later.

369
00:25:45.383 --> 00:25:47.923
Gosh, those evil punks.

370
00:25:50.393 --> 00:25:52.153
Here we go.

371
00:25:57.562 --> 00:25:59.963
I need to go.

372
00:26:00.203 --> 00:26:01.602
Let's go.

373
00:26:02.602 --> 00:26:03.602
It's done.

374
00:26:05.203 --> 00:26:06.272
I need to hurry.

375
00:26:32.163 --> 00:26:33.163
Let us...

376
00:26:33.433 --> 00:26:36.973
begin the wedding of the groom, Park Jae Hyun,

377
00:26:36.973 --> 00:26:39.102
and the bride, Kang Soo Jin.

378
00:26:39.403 --> 00:26:41.272
Groom, please enter.

379
00:26:53.552 --> 00:26:54.552
Pil.

380
00:26:55.782 --> 00:26:57.153
Why can't I see you?

381
00:26:58.953 --> 00:27:01.223
Did you fail to travel through time this time?

382
00:27:02.992 --> 00:27:04.092
Did I...

383
00:27:04.592 --> 00:27:05.992
come by myself?

384
00:27:06.363 --> 00:27:07.363
Goodness.

385
00:27:12.832 --> 00:27:13.842
Soo Jin.

386
00:27:14.502 --> 00:27:15.673
You must be nervous.

387
00:27:16.873 --> 00:27:18.242
It's okay.

388
00:27:19.242 --> 00:27:21.713
The thought of walking my only daughter...

389
00:27:22.282 --> 00:27:23.613
down the aisle...

390
00:27:24.713 --> 00:27:26.312
makes me want to cry.

391
00:27:29.052 --> 00:27:31.752
Well... Dad.

392
00:27:32.252 --> 00:27:34.762
I know. It's okay.

393
00:27:35.592 --> 00:27:38.062
It's time for the bride to enter.

394
00:27:38.062 --> 00:27:39.163
Okay.

395
00:27:40.403 --> 00:27:41.762
Let's go.

396
00:27:42.963 --> 00:27:44.072
Stand up.

397
00:27:45.532 --> 00:27:46.873
Let's go.

398
00:27:47.072 --> 00:27:48.173
It's okay.

399
00:27:48.772 --> 00:27:49.842
Hurry.

400
00:27:51.373 --> 00:27:54.282
The groom looks so trustworthy, doesn't he?

401
00:27:54.483 --> 00:27:58.883
Now, it's time for the beautiful bride to enter.

402
00:27:59.012 --> 00:28:00.983
Bride, please enter.

403
00:28:15.007 --> 00:28:18.239
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 16 Manhole "The Wedding Day"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

404
00:28:26.883 --> 00:28:28.913
Look at her.

405
00:28:30.852 --> 00:28:32.052
She's beautiful.

406
00:29:08.483 --> 00:29:10.552
(Park Jae Hyun and Kang Soo Jin's wedding)

407
00:29:17.633 --> 00:29:20.532
Do you, Jae Hyun,

408
00:29:20.663 --> 00:29:24.233
take Soo Jin to be your lawful wife?

409
00:29:24.373 --> 00:29:28.643
Do you promise to love and respect her,

410
00:29:28.973 --> 00:29:31.173
and will you live as a faithful husband...

411
00:29:31.542 --> 00:29:34.782
to keep a happy family?

412
00:29:35.082 --> 00:29:36.582
Yes, I do.

413
00:29:36.582 --> 00:29:37.852
Okay, great.

414
00:29:37.852 --> 00:29:41.052
And I will ask the bride, Kang Soo Jin.

415
00:29:41.183 --> 00:29:42.653
Soo Jin,

416
00:29:42.653 --> 00:29:46.292
do you take Park Jae Hyun as your lawful husband?

417
00:29:46.663 --> 00:29:48.092
And do you promise...

418
00:29:48.092 --> 00:29:50.233
to love and respect him,

419
00:29:50.233 --> 00:29:53.363
and will you keep a happy family?

420
00:30:03.812 --> 00:30:06.413
Excuse me, Ms. Kang Soo Jin.

421
00:30:07.983 --> 00:30:09.782
It's your turn to say "I do."

422
00:30:09.782 --> 00:30:11.352
Say "I do."

423
00:30:18.723 --> 00:30:19.723
What's going on?

424
00:30:19.723 --> 00:30:21.262
Answer my question. It's "I do."

425
00:30:21.262 --> 00:30:22.363
Soo Jin.

426
00:30:48.453 --> 00:30:51.223
Let me... Let me ask Ms. Kang...

427
00:30:51.223 --> 00:30:53.893
the same question one more time.

428
00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:55.463
Ms. Kang, will you take...

429
00:30:55.463 --> 00:30:59.062
Park Jae Hyun as your lawful husband?

430
00:31:01.032 --> 00:31:02.062
No.

431
00:31:03.602 --> 00:31:05.602
I can't marry this guy.

432
00:31:08.772 --> 00:31:09.772
What's with her?

433
00:31:10.973 --> 00:31:13.113
Soo Jin, what's wrong?

434
00:31:13.113 --> 00:31:14.113
Jae Hyun.

435
00:31:14.883 --> 00:31:17.113
Don't ever come near me again.

436
00:31:17.683 --> 00:31:18.812
Understand?

437
00:31:20.223 --> 00:31:21.522
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

438
00:31:29.463 --> 00:31:30.492
Soo Jin.

439
00:31:31.193 --> 00:31:32.193
Pil.

440
00:31:32.292 --> 00:31:33.403
You...

441
00:31:34.302 --> 00:31:35.802
went through the manhole, right?

442
00:31:36.363 --> 00:31:37.373
Yes.

443
00:31:40.802 --> 00:31:42.342
Why did you come now?

444
00:31:43.572 --> 00:31:45.342
Do you know how long I waited?

445
00:31:46.542 --> 00:31:47.842
I'm sorry that I'm late.

446
00:31:53.552 --> 00:31:54.653
Let's go.

447
00:31:58.623 --> 00:32:00.423
It looks like they're going to leave together.

448
00:32:06.933 --> 00:32:08.302
Soo Jin!

449
00:32:11.733 --> 00:32:13.502
Hey, Pil!

450
00:32:50.213 --> 00:32:52.272
Gosh, this is great.

451
00:32:52.973 --> 00:32:55.312
- Soo Jin, are you okay? - Yes.

452
00:32:56.782 --> 00:32:57.913
Pil.

453
00:32:58.352 --> 00:33:00.352
What about your wound? Are you okay?

454
00:33:00.883 --> 00:33:02.022
Yes.

455
00:33:02.552 --> 00:33:04.623
I'm fine now that everything is reset.

456
00:33:04.893 --> 00:33:05.893
Don't worry.

457
00:33:05.893 --> 00:33:08.822
That's one good thing about time traveling.

458
00:33:09.693 --> 00:33:13.903
I was worried something bad would happen.

459
00:33:17.332 --> 00:33:21.102
I was worried that you might not...

460
00:33:21.542 --> 00:33:23.072
remember me again.

461
00:33:31.883 --> 00:33:32.883
Pil.

462
00:33:33.983 --> 00:33:35.352
Let's never...

463
00:33:36.223 --> 00:33:38.322
be separated again.

464
00:33:42.923 --> 00:33:43.992
Okay.

465
00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:47.703
No matter where you are,

466
00:33:48.663 --> 00:33:50.572
no matter which time period you are in,

467
00:33:53.102 --> 00:33:54.772
I'll always be there.

468
00:33:56.613 --> 00:33:57.842
Don't worry.

469
00:35:29.303 --> 00:35:32.472
(One month later)

470
00:36:12.743 --> 00:36:15.682
Hey, Soo Jin.

471
00:36:15.983 --> 00:36:17.182
Are you all right?

472
00:36:21.082 --> 00:36:23.323
Yes, I'm okay. I haven't been summoned.

473
00:36:23.323 --> 00:36:25.093
I'm too nervous.

474
00:36:25.093 --> 00:36:26.352
I'll go over there.

475
00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:27.863
Where? My room?

476
00:36:27.863 --> 00:36:29.423
Yes. I'll be there.

477
00:36:29.593 --> 00:36:31.533
Hey, hey.

478
00:36:34.903 --> 00:36:37.033
Hey. My goodness.

479
00:36:42.403 --> 00:36:44.912
What if my parents wake up?

480
00:36:44.912 --> 00:36:47.283
We'll be fine. Come in.

481
00:36:47.283 --> 00:36:49.783
Hey. Hey! He must be insane.

482
00:36:52.383 --> 00:36:54.053
What are you doing?

483
00:36:54.053 --> 00:36:55.722
If we get summoned, we have to go together.

484
00:36:55.722 --> 00:36:56.722
Come here.

485
00:36:56.722 --> 00:36:58.352
Hey, hey.

486
00:37:02.392 --> 00:37:03.493
Give me your hand.

487
00:37:09.602 --> 00:37:11.472
You have to go back once the clock hits 12am.

488
00:37:11.903 --> 00:37:13.443
Fine.

489
00:37:18.812 --> 00:37:19.812
Hey.

490
00:37:21.812 --> 00:37:23.283
What's that sound?

491
00:37:24.352 --> 00:37:25.412
What sound?

492
00:37:27.352 --> 00:37:29.952
I think it's your heart beating.

493
00:37:33.162 --> 00:37:34.263
No, it's not.

494
00:37:35.662 --> 00:37:37.233
It's your heart.

495
00:37:37.792 --> 00:37:38.863
Do you think so?

496
00:37:39.832 --> 00:37:40.863
Goodness.

497
00:37:41.463 --> 00:37:43.772
You know what?

498
00:37:44.073 --> 00:37:45.832
It's really great to be with you.

499
00:37:46.972 --> 00:37:48.173
Whatever.

500
00:37:48.173 --> 00:37:49.772
Just check the time.

501
00:37:50.542 --> 00:37:52.812
You're right. Let's see.

502
00:37:56.312 --> 00:37:58.452
Hey, it's 11:59pm.

503
00:38:00.823 --> 00:38:03.292
10, 9,

504
00:38:03.923 --> 00:38:06.323
8, 7...

505
00:38:06.622 --> 00:38:07.923
Oh, gosh.

506
00:38:22.502 --> 00:38:23.542
Hey.

507
00:38:24.213 --> 00:38:25.412
We weren't summoned.

508
00:38:29.483 --> 00:38:31.613
Another safe day.

509
00:38:36.022 --> 00:38:37.193
Soo Jin.

510
00:38:37.423 --> 00:38:38.493
Yes?

511
00:38:40.093 --> 00:38:41.662
Should I sleep over?

512
00:38:44.932 --> 00:38:46.803
- What? - No?

513
00:38:46.803 --> 00:38:48.102
Soo Jin.

514
00:38:58.573 --> 00:39:00.912
- Mom. - Why aren't you asleep?

515
00:39:00.912 --> 00:39:03.082
- Who were you talking to? - What?

516
00:39:03.713 --> 00:39:05.412
I was on the phone with Jin Sook.

517
00:39:07.323 --> 00:39:09.222
Why is the window open? It's too cold.

518
00:39:10.252 --> 00:39:12.423
Mom, I'll close it.

519
00:39:12.722 --> 00:39:14.993
You can go to sleep. You must be tired.

520
00:39:14.993 --> 00:39:17.093
- Okay, good night. - Good night.

521
00:39:29.872 --> 00:39:32.113
Hey, this is so thrilling.

522
00:39:32.113 --> 00:39:33.883
Gosh, you're crazy.

523
00:39:33.883 --> 00:39:36.513
Seriously, you're mad.

524
00:39:38.383 --> 00:39:40.352
Soo Jin. Let's do this again tomorrow.

525
00:39:40.352 --> 00:39:41.352
Hey.

526
00:39:41.352 --> 00:39:43.522
My gosh.

527
00:39:44.252 --> 00:39:45.792
My goodness.

528
00:39:46.463 --> 00:39:49.392
Honey, how long are you going to be like this?

529
00:39:50.432 --> 00:39:53.263
We should move or something.

530
00:39:54.162 --> 00:39:55.733
The neighbors keep asking me...

531
00:39:55.733 --> 00:40:00.042
why the wedding got called off.

532
00:40:00.702 --> 00:40:04.542
I can't go out because I'm too embarrassed.

533
00:40:04.542 --> 00:40:06.513
They just weren't meant to be.

534
00:40:07.383 --> 00:40:08.613
Soo Jin didn't want to get married.

535
00:40:08.613 --> 00:40:12.412
- What can we do? - This is terrible.

536
00:40:16.553 --> 00:40:18.292
I'm off to the studio.

537
00:40:19.993 --> 00:40:23.093
How can you go to work?

538
00:40:23.093 --> 00:40:25.533
Mom, why are you doing this again?

539
00:40:26.332 --> 00:40:29.633
Will you keep going out with Pil?

540
00:40:29.633 --> 00:40:31.033
What's wrong with Pil?

541
00:40:31.033 --> 00:40:33.202
Don't you know what's wrong with him?

542
00:40:33.343 --> 00:40:35.743
He's jobless, and he has nothing to show for.

543
00:40:35.743 --> 00:40:37.772
Why would you go out with him?

544
00:40:37.772 --> 00:40:40.042
What? Awesome!

545
00:40:40.042 --> 00:40:41.883
Did I pass?

546
00:40:42.883 --> 00:40:43.983
What's that noise?

547
00:40:44.553 --> 00:40:45.883
Isn't that Pil's voice?

548
00:40:49.483 --> 00:40:51.993
Mom, Dad. I passed!

549
00:40:54.993 --> 00:40:56.093
Honey.

550
00:40:56.323 --> 00:40:58.932
Did Pil just...

551
00:40:59.233 --> 00:41:00.263
Pil.

552
00:41:01.403 --> 00:41:04.033
What? Honey, where is he going?

553
00:41:05.372 --> 00:41:07.102
I guess he's going to Soo Jin.

554
00:41:07.102 --> 00:41:09.343
Soo Jin?

555
00:41:10.972 --> 00:41:12.673
Hey, Soo Jin!

556
00:41:12.673 --> 00:41:14.443
I passed the police exam.

557
00:41:14.443 --> 00:41:16.713
Good job, Pil. Great job.

558
00:41:16.713 --> 00:41:17.713
Right?

559
00:41:18.182 --> 00:41:21.852
I passed thanks to you.

560
00:41:21.852 --> 00:41:23.222
Good job.

561
00:41:23.493 --> 00:41:24.553
We're here, too.

562
00:41:24.653 --> 00:41:27.162
You're so disgraceful.

563
00:41:27.162 --> 00:41:28.392
Hello.

564
00:41:28.963 --> 00:41:29.963
I...

565
00:41:31.162 --> 00:41:32.432
passed.

566
00:41:33.303 --> 00:41:35.162
(Congratulations on passing the police exam.)

567
00:41:36.133 --> 00:41:38.533
Every man to his own trade.

568
00:41:38.533 --> 00:41:40.142
Congratulations.

569
00:41:40.142 --> 00:41:41.743
- Thank you. - Pil.

570
00:41:41.743 --> 00:41:44.772
- Hey, Pil. Is it true? - Pil.

571
00:41:44.872 --> 00:41:46.642
It's true. Look.

572
00:41:47.542 --> 00:41:50.113
National Police Agency. Goodness, Pil!

573
00:41:50.113 --> 00:41:51.812
- Pil! - Pil.

574
00:41:52.412 --> 00:41:54.352
I can't believe this.

575
00:41:54.352 --> 00:41:56.352
My goodness.

576
00:41:56.593 --> 00:41:59.352
I feel so happy!

577
00:41:59.352 --> 00:42:02.222
I can walk around being proud of my son.

578
00:42:02.222 --> 00:42:04.363
My goodness.

579
00:42:05.662 --> 00:42:08.502
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

580
00:42:09.502 --> 00:42:12.533
Congratulations. I guess all his hard work...

581
00:42:12.702 --> 00:42:14.042
finally paid off.

582
00:42:14.042 --> 00:42:16.142
Pil was going to make it.

583
00:42:16.142 --> 00:42:18.343
You just didn't see it.

584
00:42:18.872 --> 00:42:20.983
Pil, tell me what you want to eat.

585
00:42:20.983 --> 00:42:22.142
I'll cook something delicious for you.

586
00:42:22.142 --> 00:42:23.553
- Okay. - Yes.

587
00:42:23.653 --> 00:42:25.713
Soo Jin, you have to go to work, right?

588
00:42:25.713 --> 00:42:26.983
- I'll take you to work. - Okay.

589
00:42:27.022 --> 00:42:29.423
- I'll be off now. - Bye.

590
00:42:29.423 --> 00:42:30.892
- Let's go. - Okay.

591
00:42:31.852 --> 00:42:32.892
Let's go!

592
00:42:32.892 --> 00:42:34.162
- Yes! - Goodness.

593
00:42:34.162 --> 00:42:35.162
Oh, my.

594
00:42:35.522 --> 00:42:39.193
Now that I see them, they look really good together.

595
00:42:39.193 --> 00:42:40.363
Don't you think so?

596
00:42:41.562 --> 00:42:42.602
Yes, they do.

597
00:42:42.832 --> 00:42:43.832
Right?

598
00:42:44.432 --> 00:42:45.432
Yes.

599
00:42:57.053 --> 00:43:00.153
(You can marry a pretty woman if you study hard.)

600
00:43:06.892 --> 00:43:09.522
Are you leaving because you passed?

601
00:43:10.363 --> 00:43:11.363
I'm sad to see you go.

602
00:43:12.162 --> 00:43:14.233
Hey, congratulations.

603
00:43:14.832 --> 00:43:16.162
Congratulations, Seok Tae.

604
00:43:16.162 --> 00:43:18.633
Thanks. I'm sure you'll pass too.

605
00:43:18.633 --> 00:43:20.202
Congratulations.

606
00:43:20.202 --> 00:43:22.073
Buy us drinks when you get paid.

607
00:43:22.073 --> 00:43:25.042
Okay. Call me when you want a drink. I'll buy.

608
00:43:25.042 --> 00:43:26.843
- Okay. - Don't forget.

609
00:43:26.843 --> 00:43:28.443
- I'll call you. - I'm jealous.

610
00:43:29.752 --> 00:43:31.252
(Dad)

611
00:43:32.252 --> 00:43:33.522
Hi, Dad.

612
00:43:35.122 --> 00:43:36.553
Pardon? Where?

613
00:43:41.863 --> 00:43:42.963
Excuse me.

614
00:43:43.763 --> 00:43:45.093
Are you Jo Seok Tae?

615
00:43:45.292 --> 00:43:46.432
Yes? Me?

616
00:43:47.263 --> 00:43:48.502
Who are you?

617
00:43:51.772 --> 00:43:54.772
I heard you passed the civil servant exam.

618
00:43:55.272 --> 00:43:56.843
Well, yes.

619
00:43:57.743 --> 00:44:00.443
I got a job at a bank recently.

620
00:44:00.443 --> 00:44:01.983
I see.

621
00:44:02.682 --> 00:44:06.823
It's a good thing that we both have stable jobs.

622
00:44:07.153 --> 00:44:08.153
Right?

623
00:44:09.323 --> 00:44:13.593
I don't know what you heard from my dad,

624
00:44:14.392 --> 00:44:16.832
but I actually like someone...

625
00:44:16.832 --> 00:44:17.892
It's all done.

626
00:44:20.803 --> 00:44:21.832
Congratulations.

627
00:44:21.903 --> 00:44:23.573
Thank you so much.

628
00:44:23.573 --> 00:44:25.233
I have to get going first.

629
00:44:25.233 --> 00:44:26.332
- Bye. - All right.

630
00:44:32.772 --> 00:44:34.582
Hey, Seok Tae. What are you doing?

631
00:44:35.283 --> 00:44:38.213
Ji Sook. Well...

632
00:44:38.513 --> 00:44:40.383
Are you Seok Tae's friend?

633
00:44:40.653 --> 00:44:43.053
Yes. Who are you?

634
00:44:43.053 --> 00:44:45.153
We are on a blind date.

635
00:44:45.752 --> 00:44:47.463
A blind date?

636
00:44:47.593 --> 00:44:49.863
Well, Jin Sook.

637
00:44:49.863 --> 00:44:51.593
I didn't know.

638
00:44:51.963 --> 00:44:53.133
I'm sorry.

639
00:44:53.133 --> 00:44:54.963
Good luck. See you.

640
00:44:55.133 --> 00:44:56.332
Jin Sook.

641
00:44:58.033 --> 00:44:59.872
I'm sorry.

642
00:44:59.872 --> 00:45:01.903
I have someone I like.

643
00:45:02.173 --> 00:45:04.743
- What? - I'm sorry.

644
00:45:06.983 --> 00:45:07.983
What...

645
00:45:08.113 --> 00:45:09.613
Hey, Seok Tae!

646
00:45:15.483 --> 00:45:17.493
He said he'd only like me all his life.

647
00:45:17.493 --> 00:45:18.993
Men are all the same.

648
00:45:19.892 --> 00:45:21.693
Gosh, the weather is great.

649
00:45:22.062 --> 00:45:24.233
Jin Sook.

650
00:45:26.863 --> 00:45:28.863
What? You were on a date. Why are you here?

651
00:45:28.863 --> 00:45:31.903
Well, I didn't want to go on the date.

652
00:45:31.903 --> 00:45:34.042
My dad set it up without telling me,

653
00:45:34.042 --> 00:45:35.403
so don't get me wrong.

654
00:45:35.903 --> 00:45:38.372
What an excuse. Goodness.

655
00:45:38.713 --> 00:45:40.912
Hey. I don't care...

656
00:45:40.912 --> 00:45:42.243
if you go on a date or not.

657
00:45:42.243 --> 00:45:44.013
How can you say that?

658
00:45:44.013 --> 00:45:45.752
Don't you care if I go on dates with other women?

659
00:45:45.752 --> 00:45:47.722
No, not at all.

660
00:45:48.022 --> 00:45:50.452
If you're going to date,

661
00:45:50.852 --> 00:45:52.852
date someone really pretty.

662
00:45:53.863 --> 00:45:55.593
How can you not mind?

663
00:45:55.892 --> 00:45:58.593
I'm angry just seeing you with another man.

664
00:45:59.463 --> 00:46:01.502
I don't know. I'm going inside.

665
00:46:01.763 --> 00:46:02.763
Wait.

666
00:46:03.272 --> 00:46:04.432
Tell me.

667
00:46:04.432 --> 00:46:05.932
Am I just a friend to you?

668
00:46:06.073 --> 00:46:07.803
Haven't you ever thought of me as a man?

669
00:46:11.343 --> 00:46:13.343
What are you doing? Let me go.

670
00:46:13.412 --> 00:46:15.943
No. I'm going to get an answer from you.

671
00:46:15.943 --> 00:46:17.013
Tell me now.

672
00:46:17.013 --> 00:46:19.053
Am I a man to you? Yes or no?

673
00:46:25.923 --> 00:46:26.923
Yes or no.

674
00:46:27.323 --> 00:46:28.463
What's that?

675
00:46:28.562 --> 00:46:30.033
Are you saying I'm neither?

676
00:46:31.593 --> 00:46:33.233
I'm saying there's a possibility.

677
00:46:33.233 --> 00:46:35.002
Let me go. I want to go inside.

678
00:46:41.372 --> 00:46:45.173
The one I loved

679
00:46:45.173 --> 00:46:47.312
(Family DVD Rental)

680
00:46:47.312 --> 00:46:49.812
You are

681
00:46:49.812 --> 00:46:50.852
Dal Soo!

682
00:46:51.983 --> 00:46:53.752
- Jung Ae - What?

683
00:46:54.783 --> 00:46:55.783
It's nothing.

684
00:46:56.222 --> 00:46:57.892
Pil passed the police exam.

685
00:46:57.892 --> 00:47:01.363
Really? Pil finally made it.

686
00:47:01.363 --> 00:47:03.993
Seok Tae passed a few days ago, and now Pil did too.

687
00:47:03.993 --> 00:47:06.932
Isn't it nice to have civil servant friends?

688
00:47:07.403 --> 00:47:11.173
Sure. By the way, Soo Jin must be ecstatic.

689
00:47:11.533 --> 00:47:14.843
Soo Jin's mom hated Pil because he was jobless.

690
00:47:14.843 --> 00:47:16.272
After he passed,

691
00:47:16.272 --> 00:47:18.243
I heard she changed her attitude completely.

692
00:47:20.182 --> 00:47:23.752
I guess a man should be successful.

693
00:47:23.752 --> 00:47:24.852
Don't worry.

694
00:47:24.852 --> 00:47:27.452
I'll like you even if you aren't successful.

695
00:47:30.122 --> 00:47:31.352
What's this?

696
00:47:31.493 --> 00:47:32.493
That?

697
00:47:32.752 --> 00:47:35.593
A friend from middle school...

698
00:47:35.593 --> 00:47:36.792
sent a wedding invitation.

699
00:47:37.562 --> 00:47:39.693
Your friends are all getting married.

700
00:47:39.763 --> 00:47:41.403
Won't you get married?

701
00:47:42.733 --> 00:47:43.733
Jung Ae.

702
00:47:44.303 --> 00:47:47.903
Do you think marriage is the final goal of love?

703
00:47:48.243 --> 00:47:49.403
Then what is the final goal?

704
00:47:49.542 --> 00:47:51.243
You want to be together because you love someone.

705
00:47:51.243 --> 00:47:53.343
And that's why you want to get married.

706
00:47:53.443 --> 00:47:54.443
Isn't that right?

707
00:47:54.443 --> 00:47:56.042
Even if you don't get married,

708
00:47:56.042 --> 00:47:58.013
you can live with the person you love.

709
00:47:59.513 --> 00:48:01.252
I'm a little worried actually.

710
00:48:01.622 --> 00:48:03.153
What if you change your mind...

711
00:48:03.153 --> 00:48:05.722
and leave me?

712
00:48:05.993 --> 00:48:07.093
Even if you get married,

713
00:48:07.093 --> 00:48:09.693
people can get a divorce.

714
00:48:09.693 --> 00:48:11.233
Marriage is a social institution.

715
00:48:11.233 --> 00:48:14.432
It's not a magic that prolongs love.

716
00:48:14.763 --> 00:48:16.832
Well, I know.

717
00:48:18.002 --> 00:48:19.002
Jung Ae.

718
00:48:19.673 --> 00:48:20.673
Look at me.

719
00:48:23.073 --> 00:48:25.073
As long as you don't change your mind,

720
00:48:25.772 --> 00:48:27.812
I will never break up with you.

721
00:48:29.483 --> 00:48:30.553
Trust me.

722
00:48:31.153 --> 00:48:32.153
Okay?

723
00:48:33.153 --> 00:48:34.182
Okay.

724
00:48:37.693 --> 00:48:38.693
Come here.

725
00:48:42.493 --> 00:48:45.392
Why did you call my name earlier?

726
00:48:48.233 --> 00:48:49.263
It was a song.

727
00:48:51.173 --> 00:48:52.972
Are you taking your prescription?

728
00:48:54.243 --> 00:48:55.272
Yes.

729
00:48:57.472 --> 00:48:58.542
How do you feel?

730
00:48:58.673 --> 00:49:00.912
Do you still have mood swings?

731
00:49:02.243 --> 00:49:04.352
It's better than before,

732
00:49:05.153 --> 00:49:06.582
but I still...

733
00:49:08.852 --> 00:49:09.852
Let's...

734
00:49:10.292 --> 00:49:12.423
change your prescription a bit.

735
00:49:14.222 --> 00:49:16.763
You'll get better if you continue...

736
00:49:16.763 --> 00:49:18.363
getting psychotherapy.

737
00:49:18.363 --> 00:49:19.863
Don't skip any treatments.

738
00:49:20.502 --> 00:49:21.502
Okay.

739
00:49:26.702 --> 00:49:28.272
How may I help you?

740
00:49:28.403 --> 00:49:30.243
I'm in the middle of a session.

741
00:49:31.412 --> 00:49:32.943
I'm his guardian.

742
00:49:39.383 --> 00:49:41.983
Let's go, Jae Hyun.

743
00:49:49.162 --> 00:49:50.233
Well?

744
00:50:03.713 --> 00:50:05.113
What time is it now?

745
00:50:05.113 --> 00:50:06.243
Hold on.

746
00:50:07.812 --> 00:50:09.082
It's 11:59pm.

747
00:50:09.082 --> 00:50:10.582
Hurry.

748
00:50:33.843 --> 00:50:35.943
We passed today as well.

749
00:50:36.812 --> 00:50:37.872
Soo Jin.

750
00:50:39.073 --> 00:50:41.743
It's so nerve-racking. I can't live this way.

751
00:50:41.743 --> 00:50:44.713
Pil, how about we block this manhole?

752
00:50:45.013 --> 00:50:46.113
No.

753
00:50:47.752 --> 00:50:49.452
I have a better idea...

754
00:50:50.022 --> 00:50:51.493
than blocking the manhole.

755
00:50:51.852 --> 00:50:52.923
What?

756
00:51:11.713 --> 00:51:12.812
Soo Jin.

757
00:51:14.682 --> 00:51:15.983
Please allow me...

758
00:51:16.752 --> 00:51:18.113
to stay by your side...

759
00:51:19.823 --> 00:51:21.082
regardless of...

760
00:51:21.923 --> 00:51:23.852
the time and place...

761
00:51:24.423 --> 00:51:25.493
we are in.

762
00:51:28.022 --> 00:51:29.062
Hey.

763
00:51:29.392 --> 00:51:31.662
Let me stay by your side forever to protect you,

764
00:51:33.733 --> 00:51:36.263
so that this manhole will never split us apart.

765
00:51:48.383 --> 00:51:49.542
Pil.

766
00:51:52.852 --> 00:51:54.923
Be more specific, clear, and precise...

767
00:51:54.923 --> 00:51:57.053
so I can understand.

768
00:51:57.222 --> 00:52:00.463
I mean, you only need four words.

769
00:52:00.722 --> 00:52:01.863
Or three words.

770
00:52:01.863 --> 00:52:02.923
I love you.

771
00:52:05.662 --> 00:52:06.863
I love you, Soo Jin.

772
00:52:12.102 --> 00:52:13.102
Soo Jin.

773
00:52:17.142 --> 00:52:18.412
Will you marry me?

774
00:52:29.452 --> 00:52:30.452
Here.

775
00:52:32.122 --> 00:52:33.693
Put that ring on my finger...

776
00:52:34.963 --> 00:52:36.363
before I change my mind.

777
00:53:33.883 --> 00:53:37.122
(2 Years Later)

778
00:53:39.863 --> 00:53:41.363
- Good boy. - Look over here.

779
00:53:41.363 --> 00:53:42.593
Over here.

780
00:53:43.133 --> 00:53:44.662
- Good boy. - Here.

781
00:53:44.662 --> 00:53:45.792
Over here.

782
00:53:45.792 --> 00:53:48.033
Here, here.

783
00:53:49.502 --> 00:53:51.133
He's so cute.

784
00:53:51.602 --> 00:53:54.002
My Pil is good at babysitting too.

785
00:53:54.002 --> 00:53:55.042
I guess so.

786
00:53:55.042 --> 00:53:56.972
I didn't know Pil had this kind of talent.

787
00:53:56.972 --> 00:53:58.412
It's surprising.

788
00:53:58.412 --> 00:54:01.383
It's because I'm ready to be a husband.

789
00:54:02.883 --> 00:54:05.452
Woo Ri.

790
00:54:05.452 --> 00:54:07.222
- You're here. - Hi.

791
00:54:07.923 --> 00:54:09.153
Woo Ri.

792
00:54:09.153 --> 00:54:11.122
- Goodness. - Let's see.

793
00:54:11.122 --> 00:54:13.993
Woo Ri, did you miss your dad?

794
00:54:13.993 --> 00:54:15.662
I'm sorry I was late.

795
00:54:15.662 --> 00:54:18.162
Seok Tae, how can you ask us to babysit...

796
00:54:18.162 --> 00:54:19.693
and return this late?

797
00:54:19.693 --> 00:54:21.562
We had no choice.

798
00:54:21.562 --> 00:54:23.832
The line to buy the lunch boxes was really long.

799
00:54:24.002 --> 00:54:25.702
Did you miss your mom, Woo Ri?

800
00:54:25.702 --> 00:54:27.803
Pil must take care of your child when you have one.

801
00:54:27.803 --> 00:54:29.843
He's good at babysitting.

802
00:54:29.843 --> 00:54:31.013
Of course.

803
00:54:31.472 --> 00:54:32.613
Soo Jin.

804
00:54:33.343 --> 00:54:34.642
You just give birth to a baby.

805
00:54:34.642 --> 00:54:36.113
I'll take care of the childcare.

806
00:54:36.113 --> 00:54:37.182
Okay.

807
00:54:39.053 --> 00:54:40.752
I get that, so let's take more pictures...

808
00:54:40.752 --> 00:54:42.323
before he starts crying again.

809
00:54:42.323 --> 00:54:43.323
- Okay. - Let's do that.

810
00:54:43.323 --> 00:54:44.823
- Gather around. - Shall we?

811
00:54:45.553 --> 00:54:47.062
Look over here.

812
00:54:49.222 --> 00:54:50.562
He's smiling.

813
00:54:52.033 --> 00:54:54.002
Let's take 1 more. 1, 2, 3.

814
00:54:55.233 --> 00:54:58.102
Soo Jin, let's take it together.

815
00:54:58.102 --> 00:54:59.733
- Right. - Come quick.

816
00:55:00.202 --> 00:55:01.573
Come.

817
00:55:02.372 --> 00:55:03.613
There you go.

818
00:55:04.772 --> 00:55:06.582
1, 2, 3.

819
00:55:06.812 --> 00:55:07.812
(Is he the one who used our wormhole?)

820
00:55:07.812 --> 00:55:08.812
(Is he the one who used our wormhole?)

821
00:55:09.613 --> 00:55:11.912
(He challenged himself for an impossible mission.)

822
00:55:13.182 --> 00:55:14.622
(Impossible mission? What is that?)

823
00:55:14.622 --> 00:55:15.852
(He tried to make his love come true.)

824
00:55:15.852 --> 00:55:17.022
(His one-sided love which went on for 28 years.)

825
00:55:17.423 --> 00:55:18.693
(Love?)

826
00:55:18.693 --> 00:55:20.622
(Is it that important to humans?)

827
00:55:21.622 --> 00:55:22.823
(Was his mission successful?)

828
00:55:22.823 --> 00:55:23.832
(As you can see.)

829
00:55:23.832 --> 00:55:24.832
(It's interesting.)

830
00:55:24.832 --> 00:55:25.832
(Record this.)

831
00:55:25.832 --> 00:55:26.963
(Should we take back our wormhole then?)

832
00:55:26.963 --> 00:55:28.102
(Leave it be. We should study more on their love.)

833
00:55:28.102 --> 00:55:29.702
(Leave it be. We should study more on their love.)

834
00:55:29.932 --> 00:55:31.733
(Is there another suitable person?)

835
00:55:50.522 --> 00:55:52.892
I wonder if Jung Ae closed her store already.

836
00:56:04.972 --> 00:56:05.972
Hi, Jung Ae.

837
00:56:07.303 --> 00:56:08.743
Did you close up?

838
00:56:08.772 --> 00:56:10.642
Yes, I closed up...

839
00:56:10.642 --> 00:56:12.513
and am on my way home after buy some groceries.

840
00:56:12.513 --> 00:56:13.983
What's up?

841
00:56:14.182 --> 00:56:17.053
I just called to see how you're doing.

842
00:56:18.783 --> 00:56:21.222
Jung Ae, are you hungry?

843
00:56:21.452 --> 00:56:23.493
Shall we meet at the cart bar on the intersection?

844
00:56:23.493 --> 00:56:24.653
I'll treat you to udon.

845
00:56:25.852 --> 00:56:28.022
Why should I have udon with you?

846
00:56:28.122 --> 00:56:29.792
I planned to have ramyeon with Dal Soo.

847
00:56:29.792 --> 00:56:30.832
I'm hanging up.

848
00:56:31.493 --> 00:56:33.133
He's so weird.

849
00:56:33.133 --> 00:56:34.463
Wait, Jung Ae.

850
00:56:40.403 --> 00:56:42.903
Right, it's too late for udon.

851
00:56:43.812 --> 00:56:44.943
I'll only get fat.

852
00:56:46.682 --> 00:56:49.613
I should just go home and sleep.

853
00:57:07.963 --> 00:57:10.303
What? What's going on?

854
00:57:11.133 --> 00:57:13.673
Help me!

855
00:57:14.002 --> 00:57:16.912
What on earth is going on?

856
00:57:20.412 --> 00:57:21.483
Goodness!

857
00:57:23.682 --> 00:57:25.153
Time flies.

858
00:57:25.983 --> 00:57:28.522
It's been a year since we got married.

859
00:57:28.823 --> 00:57:29.823
Right.

860
00:57:30.292 --> 00:57:33.263
Seeing as to how we haven't been summoned,

861
00:57:33.363 --> 00:57:35.222
it doesn't seem like the manhole is working.

862
00:57:35.263 --> 00:57:36.292
I know.

863
00:57:38.392 --> 00:57:39.693
Come to think of it,

864
00:57:40.303 --> 00:57:42.863
we wouldn't be together if not for the manhole.

865
00:57:43.202 --> 00:57:46.202
I'm so thankful to it, right?

866
00:57:46.202 --> 00:57:47.202
Right.

867
00:57:50.272 --> 00:57:52.173
Hey!

868
00:57:52.173 --> 00:57:54.213
Hey.

869
00:57:54.642 --> 00:57:57.182
- Listen to me. - What's going on?

870
00:57:57.352 --> 00:57:59.213
I told this to the other kids,

871
00:57:59.213 --> 00:58:00.622
and they all think I'm crazy.

872
00:58:00.752 --> 00:58:03.452
But you will believe me, right?

873
00:58:03.722 --> 00:58:04.752
What is it?

874
00:58:06.222 --> 00:58:07.863
Every night at midnight,

875
00:58:08.792 --> 00:58:10.763
something strange has been happening to me.

876
00:58:12.193 --> 00:58:13.463
I go back to being a high school student...

877
00:58:14.562 --> 00:58:16.033
and then a kindergartener.

878
00:58:16.803 --> 00:58:19.133
I go back and forth from the past and present.

879
00:58:19.472 --> 00:58:22.102
I just got back.

880
00:58:23.772 --> 00:58:26.412
Come on. I'm telling you it's true.

881
00:58:26.412 --> 00:58:27.943
It's really happening.

882
00:58:28.412 --> 00:58:30.182
Why are you laughing?

883
00:58:32.013 --> 00:58:33.222
- Manhole? - Manhole?

884
00:58:34.423 --> 00:58:35.653
Manhole?

885
00:58:52.472 --> 00:58:55.372
(Thank you for watching Manhole.)
