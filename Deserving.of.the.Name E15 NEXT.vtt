00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:19.774
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.504
Why is it so quiet?

3
00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:56.993
In 15 days,

4
00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.493
our army will reach Hanyang.

5
00:01:07.804 --> 00:01:09.534
My heart is still in pain.

6
00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:48.213
Hey.

7
00:01:50.713 --> 00:01:51.713
What is wrong?

8
00:01:52.243 --> 00:01:55.013
I heard something here.

9
00:01:55.383 --> 00:01:57.213
There is nothing here.

10
00:01:58.424 --> 00:01:59.424
Let us go.

11
00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:51.073
I think it's aortic stenosis.

12
00:02:51.274 --> 00:02:52.274
I'll be there in five minutes.

13
00:02:52.274 --> 00:02:54.404
Reserve an operation room and call Professor Jung.

14
00:03:03.953 --> 00:03:05.053
Please.

15
00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:14.293
Master Heo's house.

16
00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:17.694
Yeon Yi was there.

17
00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:21.774
Hey.

18
00:03:23.034 --> 00:03:24.103
Master Heo.

19
00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:30.874
Master Heo.

20
00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:32.414
Mak Gae.

21
00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:47.994
I saw Yeon Yi...

22
00:03:48.393 --> 00:03:50.164
that time...

23
00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:51.664
at the room where I was treated.

24
00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:53.904
Mak Gae.

25
00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:12.754
Why is this here?

26
00:04:32.844 --> 00:04:35.074
(Emergency Room)

27
00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:47.454
Yeon Kyung.

28
00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:48.853
Are you okay?

29
00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:06.074
Grandpa.

30
00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:08.313
Are you awake?

31
00:05:08.514 --> 00:05:10.043
Do you know where this is?

32
00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:13.443
Why am I here?

33
00:05:13.443 --> 00:05:15.214
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

34
00:05:17.214 --> 00:05:20.253
It's nothing. Don't make a fuss.

35
00:05:20.584 --> 00:05:21.853
It's nothing?

36
00:05:21.853 --> 00:05:23.654
Who knows what would've happened?

37
00:05:24.394 --> 00:05:26.894
You could've died suddenly, and that's nothing?

38
00:05:26.894 --> 00:05:28.894
You're too loud.

39
00:05:28.894 --> 00:05:30.394
You're hurting my ears.

40
00:05:30.394 --> 00:05:31.834
Did you already know about this?

41
00:05:33.303 --> 00:05:35.974
But why didn't you tell me?

42
00:05:35.974 --> 00:05:38.003
You're embarrassing me.

43
00:05:38.003 --> 00:05:39.704
I'm going home.

44
00:05:39.803 --> 00:05:40.943
You can't.

45
00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:42.613
Stay still.

46
00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:44.914
We're going to do surgery right away.

47
00:05:44.914 --> 00:05:46.844
Surgery?

48
00:05:47.683 --> 00:05:50.113
What are you talking about?

49
00:05:50.113 --> 00:05:51.753
I'm the doctor here.

50
00:05:53.123 --> 00:05:54.123
Listen to me.

51
00:05:54.224 --> 00:05:56.894
- Let's go to the operation room. - I reserved an operation room,

52
00:05:56.894 --> 00:06:00.094
but Professor Jung is in Incheon, so he wants to do it tomorrow.

53
00:06:00.094 --> 00:06:01.733
Did you tell him that it was urgent?

54
00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:02.863
I did.

55
00:06:04.134 --> 00:06:05.303
I'll call him.

56
00:06:11.034 --> 00:06:13.743
Let me go home.

57
00:06:31.863 --> 00:06:34.793
Pass the bridge over the stream and go north 2km.

58
00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.563
If you go northwest for 30 minutes,

59
00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:42.334
you will see an abandoned house.

60
00:06:55.683 --> 00:06:56.853
Who is it?

61
00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.123
Mak Gae.

62
00:06:59.784 --> 00:07:00.983
Dr. Heo.

63
00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:02.154
Mak Gae.

64
00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:04.894
You are alive.

65
00:07:05.394 --> 00:07:07.123
It is a relief that you are safe.

66
00:07:07.324 --> 00:07:09.193
Are you hurt anywhere?

67
00:07:09.363 --> 00:07:11.764
I am okay.

68
00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:14.204
You do not look good.

69
00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:17.274
I am okay. What about the royal physician?

70
00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:19.043
Is he okay?

71
00:07:20.204 --> 00:07:21.443
He is okay.

72
00:07:35.253 --> 00:07:38.164
These people have been wounded by the Japanese soldiers.

73
00:07:38.923 --> 00:07:41.933
When my brother brings those who are still alive,

74
00:07:42.493 --> 00:07:44.034
Master Heo treats them.

75
00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:55.144
Hello.

76
00:07:57.214 --> 00:07:59.183
You must have received the message I sent you.

77
00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:03.183
You should go inside.

78
00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:06.353
Did you not come here to see Yeon Yi?

79
00:08:18.103 --> 00:08:19.204
Dr. Heo.

80
00:08:20.534 --> 00:08:22.704
Oh, my. Oh, my.

81
00:08:49.034 --> 00:08:50.994
Mister.

82
00:08:55.504 --> 00:08:56.833
I am sorry...

83
00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:01.673
that I came too late and made you wait.

84
00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.384
And...

85
00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:09.654
thank you for holding on for so long.

86
00:09:17.553 --> 00:09:21.234
Just wait a little longer. I will cure you.

87
00:09:39.384 --> 00:09:42.854
What happened to you?

88
00:09:44.624 --> 00:09:45.723
It is convulsion.

89
00:09:46.024 --> 00:09:48.423
Her stomach is weak while her liver is all right.

90
00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:51.764
But they do not seem to have been caused by her illness.

91
00:09:53.223 --> 00:09:54.364
You are right.

92
00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:56.734
It is too much for a little child.

93
00:09:56.734 --> 00:09:58.234
Her family had lived in the mountains...

94
00:09:59.134 --> 00:10:01.703
where they hunted wild animals.

95
00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:07.604
While her father went out to hunt,

96
00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:11.144
her mother was raped by...

97
00:10:11.813 --> 00:10:13.884
a group of bandits.

98
00:10:14.484 --> 00:10:17.014
And the child saw her mother...

99
00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:18.854
hanging herself.

100
00:10:20.484 --> 00:10:22.693
I have tried my best,

101
00:10:22.994 --> 00:10:26.024
but you are the only one who can save the child.

102
00:10:28.963 --> 00:10:32.833
But seeing as she has been holding out so well,

103
00:10:33.004 --> 00:10:36.034
your medicine must have given her a will to live.

104
00:10:45.884 --> 00:10:47.183
Do you think you can do it?

105
00:10:47.744 --> 00:10:50.053
I will try to do everything I can.

106
00:10:50.313 --> 00:10:53.524
She has a deep wound in her heart. It will not be easy.

107
00:10:57.394 --> 00:10:58.524
Who is this?

108
00:11:06.904 --> 00:11:09.404
It is you.

109
00:11:14.303 --> 00:11:15.343
Kill him.

110
00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:22.813
We must have been destined to meet.

111
00:11:34.423 --> 00:11:36.534
Why can't I go home?

112
00:11:37.333 --> 00:11:38.821
If a patient wants to go home,

113
00:11:38.846 --> 00:11:40.457
you should let him.

114
00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:42.234
Can a doctor force me to stay?

115
00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:45.504
If you have the surgery, you can live healthier and longer.

116
00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:48.673
Why won't you have the surgery?

117
00:11:48.673 --> 00:11:50.813
I've lived long enough.

118
00:11:50.813 --> 00:11:53.443
Why would I have to live longer?

119
00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:56.914
Living too long can be tiring.

120
00:12:00.854 --> 00:12:02.553
There's a different reason to this.

121
00:12:06.323 --> 00:12:07.524
Tell me what it is.

122
00:12:08.734 --> 00:12:10.234
Why are you doing this?

123
00:12:14.573 --> 00:12:16.573
I haven't been a good father.

124
00:12:18.203 --> 00:12:20.604
I let my son and his wife die earlier than me.

125
00:12:21.104 --> 00:12:23.274
I don't deserve to have surgery...

126
00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:25.843
and live longer.

127
00:12:26.543 --> 00:12:28.953
I am a doctor, and yet,

128
00:12:29.254 --> 00:12:33.223
I didn't even care for my son's feelings.

129
00:12:33.624 --> 00:12:35.354
I couldn't even save his wife.

130
00:12:36.994 --> 00:12:38.994
And I let my precious granddaughter...

131
00:12:40.124 --> 00:12:43.833
lose her parents at such an early age.

132
00:12:45.433 --> 00:12:46.963
I don't deserve to live longer.

133
00:12:58.614 --> 00:13:00.443
Now you know the reason, let me go.

134
00:13:01.683 --> 00:13:02.854
Then what about me?

135
00:13:04.313 --> 00:13:05.683
Don't you care about me?

136
00:13:07.894 --> 00:13:10.124
I don't have parents nor siblings.

137
00:13:14.534 --> 00:13:16.164
If I don't have you,

138
00:13:19.004 --> 00:13:20.563
I would really be alone.

139
00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:24.943
Can you really...

140
00:13:27.803 --> 00:13:29.313
leave me behind?

141
00:13:56.134 --> 00:13:59.543
While I am gone, look after Grandfather.

142
00:13:59.644 --> 00:14:02.274
My grandfather? Why?

143
00:14:09.713 --> 00:14:10.784
Yeon Kyung.

144
00:14:12.624 --> 00:14:15.124
I heard your grandfather fainted. Is he all right?

145
00:14:21.364 --> 00:14:22.534
I...

146
00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:25.664
don't deserve this.

147
00:14:27.604 --> 00:14:28.973
I don't deserve this.

148
00:14:30.173 --> 00:14:33.303
He would be better after the surgery.

149
00:14:34.473 --> 00:14:35.543
I am sorry...

150
00:14:36.914 --> 00:14:38.213
about my grandfather.

151
00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:42.414
You don't need to apologize.

152
00:14:43.754 --> 00:14:45.124
You didn't do anything wrong.

153
00:14:45.683 --> 00:14:48.793
And this isn't because of that.

154
00:14:51.723 --> 00:14:54.093
I heard that you helped persuade...

155
00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:57.463
Mr. Park. Thank you.

156
00:14:58.703 --> 00:15:00.203
It was nothing.

157
00:15:01.874 --> 00:15:05.573
But why isn't Heo Im here?

158
00:15:05.573 --> 00:15:06.703
Well,

159
00:15:09.673 --> 00:15:11.114
he went somewhere.

160
00:15:11.683 --> 00:15:12.683
Where?

161
00:15:14.244 --> 00:15:15.284
Did he...

162
00:15:16.183 --> 00:15:17.953
go back to Joseon?

163
00:15:21.953 --> 00:15:23.124
Is he gone for good?

164
00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:25.264
No.

165
00:15:28.463 --> 00:15:29.764
He will come back.

166
00:15:31.734 --> 00:15:32.833
He told me that he will.

167
00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:38.473
If you didn't leave for good, why did he have to leave now?

168
00:15:40.543 --> 00:15:42.014
There's nothing important there.

169
00:15:44.374 --> 00:15:45.384
Jae Ha.

170
00:15:48.884 --> 00:15:50.313
It's about something important.

171
00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:56.293
It's important for both of us.

172
00:15:58.723 --> 00:16:00.524
There's someone he has to save.

173
00:16:02.563 --> 00:16:03.693
He can't...

174
00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:07.703
let her down this time.

175
00:16:10.374 --> 00:16:11.973
He stabbed himself...

176
00:16:15.644 --> 00:16:17.644
so that he could go and save her.

177
00:16:33.494 --> 00:16:35.333
I am lucky...

178
00:16:36.193 --> 00:16:37.693
that I met you again today.

179
00:16:38.303 --> 00:16:41.703
I never lose my prey.

180
00:16:41.973 --> 00:16:45.573
If you want me, I am willing to die.

181
00:16:46.244 --> 00:16:47.874
Let us go somewhere else. This is...

182
00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:50.443
Shut your mouth. Are there Joseon people inside?

183
00:16:58.354 --> 00:17:00.053
- Search the house. - Yes, sir.

184
00:17:00.154 --> 00:17:01.293
Wait.

185
00:17:02.293 --> 00:17:03.823
There are patients inside.

186
00:17:04.053 --> 00:17:05.963
These are doctors who care for these patients.

187
00:17:06.423 --> 00:17:08.164
I know that we are in war,

188
00:17:08.164 --> 00:17:10.664
but you cannot harm doctors and patients.

189
00:17:10.664 --> 00:17:11.963
That has nothing to do with me.

190
00:17:32.523 --> 00:17:33.654
What is going on?

191
00:17:33.753 --> 00:17:35.124
There are Japanese soldiers.

192
00:17:36.154 --> 00:17:37.223
Japanese soldiers?

193
00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:25.003
You scumbags.

194
00:18:27.844 --> 00:18:29.513
My goodness! Who is this?

195
00:18:29.513 --> 00:18:31.213
- He... He is... - Is that you, Heo Im?

196
00:18:31.213 --> 00:18:33.183
- Why are you... - Over there.

197
00:18:33.183 --> 00:18:35.253
- There! - Wait a minute.

198
00:18:35.253 --> 00:18:36.654
I need to kill these men.

199
00:18:45.364 --> 00:18:47.664
Gosh, I am sick of these jerks.

200
00:18:47.664 --> 00:18:49.634
It took little more time than usual today.

201
00:18:50.134 --> 00:18:51.263
Dr. Heo!

202
00:19:11.753 --> 00:19:13.723
Hi, are you there yet?

203
00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:15.693
How is Grandpa?

204
00:19:17.253 --> 00:19:18.493
Is he not there?

205
00:19:22.164 --> 00:19:23.463
He's not at home.

206
00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:26.104
He might come home, so I'll stay here.

207
00:19:26.104 --> 00:19:28.074
Do you know a place he might be at?

208
00:19:29.104 --> 00:19:31.033
Can you think of somewhere?

209
00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:32.374
I don't know.

210
00:19:32.574 --> 00:19:34.513
Where else would Mr. Choi be?

211
00:19:34.513 --> 00:19:36.114
He doesn't have any other family.

212
00:19:45.423 --> 00:19:46.483
Family...

213
00:19:49.594 --> 00:19:50.624
Family.

214
00:19:53.523 --> 00:19:57.294
I hoped you could succeed me...

215
00:19:57.463 --> 00:20:00.533
and take charge of the clinic.

216
00:20:01.164 --> 00:20:03.003
Even if you are my son,

217
00:20:03.503 --> 00:20:05.973
I could not make you do something as I want.

218
00:20:06.904 --> 00:20:08.414
You couldn't do it.

219
00:20:08.943 --> 00:20:11.584
I shouldn't have pressured you that much.

220
00:20:12.584 --> 00:20:13.884
Still,

221
00:20:14.983 --> 00:20:16.114
no parent in this world...

222
00:20:16.354 --> 00:20:20.854
thinks that his child is useless.

223
00:20:24.094 --> 00:20:25.723
You were never...

224
00:20:26.223 --> 00:20:29.834
a useless child to me.

225
00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:33.203
To pay back my karma,

226
00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:36.104
I've lived as a doctor so far.

227
00:20:36.273 --> 00:20:38.943
It's because when I meet you later,

228
00:20:40.203 --> 00:20:44.414
I want to feel less sorry.

229
00:20:45.483 --> 00:20:46.884
I have Yeon Kyung here.

230
00:20:47.644 --> 00:20:49.414
For Yeon Kyung,

231
00:20:50.314 --> 00:20:52.384
I want to be...

232
00:20:52.983 --> 00:20:55.354
little greedy about living. Can I do that?

233
00:20:57.223 --> 00:20:59.523
Even if I meet you little bit late,

234
00:21:00.624 --> 00:21:02.394
can you understand that?

235
00:21:13.243 --> 00:21:14.344
Dad.

236
00:21:15.473 --> 00:21:16.644
I'm sorry...

237
00:21:18.314 --> 00:21:20.144
to take away time you can spend with Grandpa.

238
00:21:20.783 --> 00:21:21.914
Instead,

239
00:21:23.654 --> 00:21:25.384
I'll do my best...

240
00:21:26.824 --> 00:21:28.193
on the homework you left for me.

241
00:21:33.963 --> 00:21:36.634
I did many bad things to Grandpa.

242
00:21:37.394 --> 00:21:39.503
I need to pay him back so much.

243
00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:42.074
So...

244
00:21:43.933 --> 00:21:45.804
please grant me some time.

245
00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:48.544
May I...

246
00:21:51.614 --> 00:21:54.144
let Grandpa go little bit later?

247
00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:21.173
Grandpa.

248
00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:23.013
Grandpa!

249
00:22:23.574 --> 00:22:27.713
It seems that I saved you, Dr. Heo. Right?

250
00:22:28.854 --> 00:22:30.314
How come you are...

251
00:22:30.314 --> 00:22:34.423
Well, I am one of the loyal troops now.

252
00:22:36.824 --> 00:22:39.493
My goodness! Hey! Did you get hit?

253
00:22:39.493 --> 00:22:41.094
- Gosh. - Oh my!

254
00:22:41.094 --> 00:22:42.094
Be careful.

255
00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:43.894
It is a light wound.

256
00:22:43.894 --> 00:22:45.304
Goodness gracious!

257
00:22:48.574 --> 00:22:51.344
Do you have liquidambar formosana and old pine tree bark?

258
00:22:51.344 --> 00:22:52.874
I ran out of what I brought here.

259
00:22:52.874 --> 00:22:54.874
I am feeling helpless now.

260
00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:56.414
What shall we do?

261
00:22:56.414 --> 00:22:58.183
Where can we get medicinal herbs at this late hour?

262
00:23:04.384 --> 00:23:05.884
You saw how I did it, right?

263
00:23:08.094 --> 00:23:10.493
Mak Gae, go and bring that lady's bag.

264
00:23:10.594 --> 00:23:12.193
- What? - Hurry.

265
00:23:13.263 --> 00:23:14.263
Yes.

266
00:23:19.033 --> 00:23:20.433
What are all these?

267
00:23:20.433 --> 00:23:23.904
A great doctor left it here for you.

268
00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:39.983
It will be over soon.

269
00:23:40.423 --> 00:23:41.423
It will be all right.

270
00:23:59.374 --> 00:24:02.443
Now, I will apply acupuncture to relieve extravasated blood.

271
00:24:06.943 --> 00:24:07.983
Hold this.

272
00:24:24.193 --> 00:24:27.203
After you left like that the other day,

273
00:24:27.203 --> 00:24:29.533
I could not sleep for days.

274
00:24:30.634 --> 00:24:32.574
I'm sorry that I asked you that kind of a favor.

275
00:24:32.644 --> 00:24:35.344
By the way, what in the world happened that day?

276
00:24:35.644 --> 00:24:37.614
I stabbed you right,

277
00:24:37.743 --> 00:24:39.844
and then suddenly, you disappeared in front of me.

278
00:24:40.544 --> 00:24:41.983
What happened to you?

279
00:24:42.654 --> 00:24:44.253
You said you were going north.

280
00:24:44.253 --> 00:24:45.253
Well...

281
00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:47.253
What is the use of going alone?

282
00:24:47.453 --> 00:24:48.894
I do not know anyone there.

283
00:24:49.124 --> 00:24:51.493
I do not have a family I need to take care of.

284
00:24:54.023 --> 00:24:56.094
How did you get to hold a sword in your hand?

285
00:24:57.634 --> 00:25:01.003
Even the king and those who are called ministers...

286
00:25:01.604 --> 00:25:04.874
are running away leaving the people behind.

287
00:25:05.044 --> 00:25:07.344
We need to protect ourselves. Do you not think so?

288
00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:12.013
I was to die in vain anyway, but you saved my life.

289
00:25:13.443 --> 00:25:16.554
If I can save several people's lives and die,

290
00:25:16.554 --> 00:25:19.423
my mom and brother will say, "My Doo Chil, glad you are here!"

291
00:25:19.423 --> 00:25:20.854
"You did a good job!"

292
00:25:21.223 --> 00:25:22.854
They will compliment me like that.

293
00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:27.023
Still, it would be nothing...

294
00:25:27.023 --> 00:25:29.794
compared to what you did and the lives you saved.

295
00:25:30.993 --> 00:25:34.634
Well, if I had not been born as a servant,

296
00:25:34.634 --> 00:25:36.273
I could have learned medical techniques.

297
00:25:38.473 --> 00:25:41.874
Then I would have saved lives like you do, Dr. Heo.

298
00:25:42.914 --> 00:25:44.013
You are awesome.

299
00:25:45.013 --> 00:25:46.013
Let us go.

300
00:25:46.213 --> 00:25:47.213
Okay.

301
00:25:57.523 --> 00:25:59.923
I do not know whether I will die today or tomorrow.

302
00:26:00.124 --> 00:26:03.164
I was worried that I might die before I repay your kindness.

303
00:26:04.703 --> 00:26:07.064
I guess my mom and brother helped me...

304
00:26:08.473 --> 00:26:10.304
to repay your kindness before I meet them.

305
00:26:12.173 --> 00:26:14.574
I paid it back, right?

306
00:26:16.273 --> 00:26:18.584
Yes. Thank you.

307
00:26:18.584 --> 00:26:21.654
You keep saving many lives, Dr. Heo.

308
00:26:21.983 --> 00:26:23.414
I will keep protecting many lives.

309
00:26:23.753 --> 00:26:26.223
If we stay alive and meet again,

310
00:26:26.223 --> 00:26:28.923
let us get along well like brothers.

311
00:26:29.894 --> 00:26:31.493
I guess I am younger than you.

312
00:26:31.594 --> 00:26:34.594
I doubt that.

313
00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:38.703
Let us say goodbye and go now.

314
00:26:38.703 --> 00:26:39.933
- Yes! - Yes!

315
00:26:43.634 --> 00:26:44.673
I hope you stay healthy.

316
00:27:24.884 --> 00:27:26.213
Professor Jung is...

317
00:27:27.144 --> 00:27:29.854
considered a very competent doctor in this field.

318
00:27:30.384 --> 00:27:32.384
Don't worry about anything.

319
00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:34.654
Relax and think that you're only going to...

320
00:27:35.223 --> 00:27:36.554
take some sound sleep.

321
00:27:39.864 --> 00:27:41.794
I want you to do it for me.

322
00:27:42.993 --> 00:27:44.094
What?

323
00:27:45.804 --> 00:27:50.134
My granddaughter is a doctor who saves people.

324
00:27:51.074 --> 00:27:52.804
Why would I leave my life...

325
00:27:53.644 --> 00:27:55.443
up to a stranger?

326
00:27:56.243 --> 00:27:58.013
- Grandpa. - Why?

327
00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.044
Are you not confident?

328
00:28:02.854 --> 00:28:06.183
Forget it if you aren't confident.

329
00:28:11.394 --> 00:28:12.824
No, Grandpa.

330
00:28:16.594 --> 00:28:18.003
I'll do it.

331
00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:24.273
I'll operate on you.

332
00:28:24.773 --> 00:28:26.044
You've done...

333
00:28:26.743 --> 00:28:29.644
nothing wrong to me.

334
00:28:30.713 --> 00:28:32.844
Don't think about such a thing.

335
00:28:34.483 --> 00:28:36.054
I was able to live...

336
00:28:36.654 --> 00:28:38.283
thanks to you.

337
00:28:39.523 --> 00:28:42.023
Thanks to...

338
00:28:42.193 --> 00:28:44.354
my precious granddaughter.

339
00:28:47.463 --> 00:28:48.834
Tell me...

340
00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:52.933
what my heart looks like...

341
00:28:54.574 --> 00:28:56.203
after the surgery.

342
00:29:00.173 --> 00:29:01.473
Okay.

343
00:29:04.644 --> 00:29:06.144
I'll take a look at it...

344
00:29:07.213 --> 00:29:09.253
and make sure to tell you...

345
00:29:10.453 --> 00:29:12.453
if it's ugly or good-looking.

346
00:29:25.104 --> 00:29:28.634
Do you remember the beautiful lady...

347
00:29:29.104 --> 00:29:30.904
whom you met last time?

348
00:29:31.904 --> 00:29:33.003
Yes.

349
00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:35.914
The lady is...

350
00:29:36.773 --> 00:29:39.384
good at keeping her promise.

351
00:29:40.084 --> 00:29:44.084
She does whatever it takes to keep her promise.

352
00:29:45.983 --> 00:29:49.523
That lady has sent me to you...

353
00:29:50.894 --> 00:29:54.664
so that I can save you and keep my promise with you.

354
00:29:57.493 --> 00:29:59.203
But there is one problem.

355
00:29:59.904 --> 00:30:03.203
It cannot be done by my will only.

356
00:30:03.604 --> 00:30:06.703
It is only possible if you help me.

357
00:30:08.513 --> 00:30:10.213
Can you help me...

358
00:30:12.084 --> 00:30:14.344
with your heart?

359
00:30:21.554 --> 00:30:25.023
All right. Then let us gather our strength...

360
00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:26.493
and pull this off together.

361
00:30:39.443 --> 00:30:41.914
- How is his vital sign? - It's clear.

362
00:30:41.914 --> 00:30:43.374
Let's do this.

363
00:30:44.584 --> 00:30:45.783
Thank you in advance.

364
00:30:47.344 --> 00:30:48.453
Min Jae.

365
00:30:49.354 --> 00:30:51.783
- Let's do this. - All right.

366
00:31:02.493 --> 00:31:04.763
You saved so many lives with your hands.

367
00:31:05.334 --> 00:31:07.564
It is the gift which your father left you with.

368
00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:13.604
Thoracic Surgeon, Choi Yeon Kyung.

369
00:31:14.273 --> 00:31:16.544
Commencing the aortic valve replacement operation.

370
00:31:17.673 --> 00:31:18.844
Scalpel.

371
00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:31.223
Make sure...

372
00:31:32.094 --> 00:31:33.294
you save that child.

373
00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:42.673
Please...

374
00:31:43.503 --> 00:31:44.844
watch me.

375
00:31:47.473 --> 00:31:48.574
You're...

376
00:31:49.213 --> 00:31:50.414
watching me, right?

377
00:32:25.683 --> 00:32:27.584
I'll place the aortic valve clamp now.

378
00:32:29.213 --> 00:32:30.483
Slow down.

379
00:32:32.054 --> 00:32:33.983
Get the cardioplegic solution ready.

380
00:32:43.433 --> 00:32:46.463
There's serious calcification on his aortic valve.

381
00:32:46.463 --> 00:32:47.703
We must be careful...

382
00:32:48.273 --> 00:32:50.634
not to damage the aortic valve when we remove it.

383
00:32:51.943 --> 00:32:53.044
Give me the Kelly clamp.

384
00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:04.654
The valve, please.

385
00:33:10.624 --> 00:33:11.693
Min Jae.

386
00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:14.064
Be careful not to entangle the string.

387
00:33:19.904 --> 00:33:22.104
Now, I will apply acupuncture on your wrist.

388
00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:24.173
It is to let go of...

389
00:33:24.943 --> 00:33:27.344
the painful moment and the part of your soul...

390
00:33:27.703 --> 00:33:29.544
which is still tied up in that moment.

391
00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:32.004
I'll remove the clamp now.

392
00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:35.214
One, Two, Three.

393
00:34:48.424 --> 00:34:50.194
You did well.

394
00:35:18.752 --> 00:35:20.462
There's Director Ma.

395
00:35:20.462 --> 00:35:21.593
Is that Director Ma?

396
00:35:23.863 --> 00:35:26.502
Did you bribe an oriental doctor to fabricate the medical accident?

397
00:35:26.502 --> 00:35:28.562
Why did you do such a thing?

398
00:35:28.562 --> 00:35:29.903
- Please say a word. - Excuse me.

399
00:35:29.903 --> 00:35:31.232
- Please say a word. - Director Ma.

400
00:35:31.232 --> 00:35:33.473
- Do you admit to it? - Sir.

401
00:35:33.473 --> 00:35:35.343
You were known as the modern Heo Jun until now.

402
00:35:35.343 --> 00:35:37.343
Please say a word to the disappointed public.

403
00:35:37.343 --> 00:35:38.513
Do you admit to your deed?

404
00:35:38.513 --> 00:35:40.383
- Director Ma. - Say a word.

405
00:35:40.383 --> 00:35:43.553
- Why did you do it? - Say a word.

406
00:35:43.553 --> 00:35:46.153
- Director Ma. - Hold on.

407
00:35:46.522 --> 00:35:48.622
- Why did you do it? - Director Ma.

408
00:35:51.022 --> 00:35:53.792
Hello? Chairman Yang, it's me.

409
00:35:53.962 --> 00:35:57.263
There's no way I'd do such a thing.

410
00:35:57.493 --> 00:35:58.933
It's all a conspiracy.

411
00:35:58.933 --> 00:36:01.803
Yes, Chairman Park. Please help me this once.

412
00:36:01.863 --> 00:36:04.433
You can't do this to me.

413
00:36:04.433 --> 00:36:05.832
Hello, Chairman Min.

414
00:36:06.303 --> 00:36:07.772
It's Ma Seong Tae.

415
00:36:08.442 --> 00:36:10.173
Who are you?

416
00:36:10.973 --> 00:36:12.473
You will also be in trouble...

417
00:36:12.772 --> 00:36:15.312
if I go public.

418
00:36:16.142 --> 00:36:19.312
I don't know what you're talking about.

419
00:36:20.122 --> 00:36:24.423
I heard the board of directors there will announce something soon.

420
00:36:25.292 --> 00:36:28.493
Was it about the dismissal of the current hospital director?

421
00:36:28.763 --> 00:36:31.462
Wait. What do you mean?

422
00:36:31.633 --> 00:36:32.993
Chairman Min.

423
00:36:33.433 --> 00:36:35.133
It's my fault.

424
00:36:35.203 --> 00:36:38.173
You're the only one to help me.

425
00:36:38.173 --> 00:36:39.903
Chairman Min.

426
00:36:40.173 --> 00:36:42.042
Hello?

427
00:36:43.442 --> 00:36:44.442
No.

428
00:36:45.942 --> 00:36:48.712
Heo Im, you punk. I'm going to kill you.

429
00:36:49.542 --> 00:36:51.252
You probably won't be able to do that.

430
00:36:57.993 --> 00:36:59.053
He...

431
00:37:00.363 --> 00:37:01.892
went back to Joseon.

432
00:37:05.763 --> 00:37:06.803
He's moving...

433
00:37:07.462 --> 00:37:08.732
back and forth of his own will now.

434
00:37:08.732 --> 00:37:11.102
He returned because he had to save a patient.

435
00:37:12.372 --> 00:37:14.343
He even endured...

436
00:37:15.703 --> 00:37:17.573
the pain of stabbing his own heart.

437
00:37:17.573 --> 00:37:18.673
He stabbed what?

438
00:37:19.712 --> 00:37:20.712
What?

439
00:37:21.383 --> 00:37:23.082
He's doing crazy things now.

440
00:37:23.082 --> 00:37:24.153
Grandpa,

441
00:37:25.352 --> 00:37:27.323
did you ever do something like that as a doctor in your life?

442
00:37:28.582 --> 00:37:30.323
Did you ever...

443
00:37:31.352 --> 00:37:33.692
endure pain and getting hurt...

444
00:37:34.923 --> 00:37:36.093
to save a single person?

445
00:37:36.093 --> 00:37:37.192
What do you want...

446
00:37:38.763 --> 00:37:40.863
to tell me?

447
00:37:44.732 --> 00:37:47.502
When the ones you had trust in turn their backs on you...

448
00:37:49.042 --> 00:37:50.343
When you become alone,

449
00:37:50.912 --> 00:37:52.513
call me then.

450
00:37:54.142 --> 00:37:55.283
You're the only one...

451
00:37:57.283 --> 00:37:58.982
I have now.

452
00:38:12.033 --> 00:38:16.473
(Director's room)

453
00:38:50.133 --> 00:38:51.803
Mister.

454
00:38:51.903 --> 00:38:54.272
Yes, did you wake up?

455
00:38:54.542 --> 00:38:55.903
Are you better now?

456
00:38:55.973 --> 00:38:57.912
Yes, I am okay.

457
00:38:57.912 --> 00:39:01.042
You did a good job.

458
00:39:01.482 --> 00:39:03.183
Thank you.

459
00:39:09.352 --> 00:39:10.453
Doctor.

460
00:39:12.692 --> 00:39:13.692
Yeon Yi.

461
00:39:14.162 --> 00:39:15.562
Father.

462
00:39:15.562 --> 00:39:18.462
Father is here.

463
00:39:20.602 --> 00:39:21.863
You are saved now.

464
00:39:22.602 --> 00:39:24.403
You are saved.

465
00:39:25.433 --> 00:39:27.203
Doctor Heo.

466
00:39:27.203 --> 00:39:29.673
Thank you.

467
00:39:29.673 --> 00:39:31.442
Do not mention it.

468
00:39:32.212 --> 00:39:33.812
I am sorry.

469
00:39:33.812 --> 00:39:35.042
No.

470
00:39:35.542 --> 00:39:38.453
Not only did you save Yeon Yi,

471
00:39:38.653 --> 00:39:40.352
you also saved me.

472
00:39:41.982 --> 00:39:43.692
I was going to follow Yeon Yi...

473
00:39:44.723 --> 00:39:48.122
if something bad happened to her.

474
00:39:49.662 --> 00:39:51.133
You saved...

475
00:39:52.062 --> 00:39:54.633
Yeon Yi and I.

476
00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:58.073
Thank you so much.

477
00:39:58.332 --> 00:39:59.573
Do not mention it.

478
00:40:04.212 --> 00:40:05.272
Yeon Yi.

479
00:40:09.013 --> 00:40:10.183
You went through a lot.

480
00:40:18.453 --> 00:40:19.823
Oh, my.

481
00:40:27.703 --> 00:40:29.433
Oh, my.

482
00:40:37.743 --> 00:40:40.513
Why did you not follow the king?

483
00:40:42.183 --> 00:40:45.183
Being next to the king is the safest in times like this.

484
00:40:45.183 --> 00:40:47.183
Why are you here then?

485
00:40:48.082 --> 00:40:51.252
That world is safer.

486
00:40:55.863 --> 00:40:58.363
Why is Yeon Yi staying with you?

487
00:41:00.703 --> 00:41:02.602
Are you angry because I took care...

488
00:41:02.602 --> 00:41:04.772
of the child you neglected and abandoned?

489
00:41:08.142 --> 00:41:09.403
After you left,

490
00:41:09.812 --> 00:41:11.712
I found out what happened later...

491
00:41:11.712 --> 00:41:13.142
and searched for her.

492
00:41:13.383 --> 00:41:14.982
I did not think that you would be able to live as a doctor...

493
00:41:14.982 --> 00:41:16.553
when you came back here...

494
00:41:16.752 --> 00:41:19.053
if something happened to her.

495
00:41:20.553 --> 00:41:23.252
Do you still think I will return?

496
00:41:23.323 --> 00:41:25.192
That is something you should ask yourself.

497
00:41:25.192 --> 00:41:26.763
Why are you asking me that?

498
00:41:37.133 --> 00:41:39.002
I heard this was yours.

499
00:41:39.173 --> 00:41:40.442
That is not mine.

500
00:41:41.272 --> 00:41:43.673
That stayed with me temporarily.

501
00:41:45.173 --> 00:41:47.743
I do not know the secrets of that case.

502
00:41:47.743 --> 00:41:50.252
Such as when it started to exist,

503
00:41:50.252 --> 00:41:52.383
and how it ended up to someone.

504
00:41:53.022 --> 00:41:54.022
But...

505
00:41:55.582 --> 00:41:57.622
I also gained the chance to become a doctor again...

506
00:41:57.622 --> 00:42:00.323
thanks to that case.

507
00:42:01.593 --> 00:42:03.392
That is all I know.

508
00:42:06.162 --> 00:42:08.832
I think it is because I had to protect.

509
00:42:09.332 --> 00:42:11.732
That is my guess.

510
00:42:15.442 --> 00:42:16.712
Protect?

511
00:42:16.872 --> 00:42:19.272
Doctors are rare at this time.

512
00:42:20.013 --> 00:42:23.053
Especially talented doctors.

513
00:42:23.613 --> 00:42:25.712
There must be a reason why that case chose you...

514
00:42:25.883 --> 00:42:28.883
especially when we are at war.

515
00:42:30.423 --> 00:42:32.192
If my guess is right,

516
00:42:34.022 --> 00:42:37.692
you must know the meaning and value of your skills.

517
00:42:40.303 --> 00:42:43.133
Above all, medicine is hard to acquire and usually expensive.

518
00:42:43.332 --> 00:42:46.002
But acupuncture only needs moxa and needles.

519
00:42:46.673 --> 00:42:48.403
It is a perfect treatment...

520
00:42:49.772 --> 00:42:51.843
for the people who are poor.

521
00:42:54.513 --> 00:42:57.953
You said you would not take any memories from here with you.

522
00:42:58.482 --> 00:43:02.323
You returned on your own will to save a child at this dangerous time.

523
00:43:04.752 --> 00:43:06.892
That choice was not wrong.

524
00:43:08.522 --> 00:43:11.433
What are these patterns?

525
00:43:11.593 --> 00:43:14.502
You must have been through a lot.

526
00:43:15.933 --> 00:43:18.272
It signifies the enlightenment you found...

527
00:43:19.033 --> 00:43:23.113
and the progress of your change as a doctor.

528
00:43:29.712 --> 00:43:31.183
I have not seen this before.

529
00:43:31.482 --> 00:43:33.423
It must be time.

530
00:43:41.392 --> 00:43:45.763
Grandpa, it was hard for me to do surgery.

531
00:43:47.133 --> 00:43:50.372
So live a long...

532
00:43:51.933 --> 00:43:53.203
and healthy life...

533
00:43:54.973 --> 00:43:56.542
with me.

534
00:43:56.613 --> 00:43:59.442
I thought my precious granddaughter...

535
00:43:59.912 --> 00:44:03.883
was good at saving people.

536
00:44:04.513 --> 00:44:05.953
But I was wrong.

537
00:44:06.723 --> 00:44:08.683
What?

538
00:44:09.122 --> 00:44:12.522
She's a doctor that's also good at healing the minds.

539
00:44:19.593 --> 00:44:20.662
Grandpa.

540
00:44:22.062 --> 00:44:25.703
Did he also know?

541
00:44:27.803 --> 00:44:29.042
He...

542
00:44:30.872 --> 00:44:33.883
asked to take care of you before he left.

543
00:44:37.412 --> 00:44:39.352
I was almost in big trouble with him.

544
00:44:40.223 --> 00:44:42.082
He would've scolded me for not protecting you.

545
00:44:44.292 --> 00:44:45.522
Yeon Kyung.

546
00:44:48.062 --> 00:44:50.792
You once said you wanted to become an oriental medicine doctor.

547
00:44:50.792 --> 00:44:53.303
But when you said you were going to medical school,

548
00:44:53.803 --> 00:44:57.473
I wasn't sad at all.

549
00:44:58.602 --> 00:45:00.442
You don't have to work next to me,

550
00:45:00.442 --> 00:45:02.673
or work at Haeminseo.

551
00:45:03.002 --> 00:45:05.642
Be aside people...

552
00:45:06.743 --> 00:45:08.412
who need you.

553
00:45:10.453 --> 00:45:11.653
Save them,

554
00:45:12.383 --> 00:45:13.522
and heal them.

555
00:45:13.953 --> 00:45:16.792
It doesn't matter as long as you're a good doctor.

556
00:45:19.392 --> 00:45:22.593
I now know that this is the place...

557
00:45:22.863 --> 00:45:25.593
you're supposed to be.

558
00:45:29.973 --> 00:45:32.673
People shine...

559
00:45:33.073 --> 00:45:36.743
and be their true selves...

560
00:45:37.113 --> 00:45:40.042
when they are at the place...

561
00:45:40.442 --> 00:45:44.283
they belong.

562
00:46:04.002 --> 00:46:06.002
Where do you think his boyfriend is?

563
00:46:06.002 --> 00:46:08.403
I'm not sure. Why isn't he here?

564
00:46:08.403 --> 00:46:10.573
I wonder why he isn't here at a time like this.

565
00:46:10.573 --> 00:46:13.412
Maybe he broke up with her?

566
00:46:13.412 --> 00:46:14.843
Be quiet.

567
00:46:15.013 --> 00:46:16.183
Punk.

568
00:46:16.553 --> 00:46:17.953
It's been a while now.

569
00:46:17.953 --> 00:46:19.823
- Did he go somewhere? - Will he ever be back?

570
00:46:19.823 --> 00:46:21.823
- Let's go. - Gosh.

571
00:46:34.403 --> 00:46:36.803
Are you saying...

572
00:46:37.173 --> 00:46:39.232
I cannot go to the other world when the time comes?

573
00:46:39.473 --> 00:46:41.803
Whether you choose to stay here or there,

574
00:46:42.372 --> 00:46:43.973
you will have to make a decision at the end.

575
00:46:44.973 --> 00:46:47.843
Which way you choose, it will come to an end soon.

576
00:46:58.522 --> 00:46:59.962
Mister.

577
00:47:09.872 --> 00:47:12.073
Why did you wait for me?

578
00:47:12.303 --> 00:47:15.372
Because you promised me.

579
00:47:15.372 --> 00:47:17.243
Did you trust that promise?

580
00:47:20.243 --> 00:47:22.243
I was trusted by someone after all.

581
00:47:24.312 --> 00:47:25.453
Mister.

582
00:47:26.153 --> 00:47:28.852
I want to be a doctor when I grow up.

583
00:47:28.852 --> 00:47:29.953
A doctor?

584
00:47:32.453 --> 00:47:34.363
Why? Whom do you want to treat?

585
00:47:34.423 --> 00:47:37.792
Sick children like me.

586
00:47:39.562 --> 00:47:42.933
I want to treat them like you did to me.

587
00:47:46.332 --> 00:47:50.212
I know that there is a war going on right now.

588
00:47:51.743 --> 00:47:53.912
There are a lot of sick children.

589
00:47:55.642 --> 00:47:58.712
It would be great if I was a doctor now.

590
00:47:59.613 --> 00:48:02.883
I need more time to grow up.

591
00:48:14.062 --> 00:48:16.062
(Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic)

592
00:48:23.272 --> 00:48:25.013
I shall come back right away...

593
00:48:26.173 --> 00:48:27.642
even if I happen to go to Joseon.

594
00:48:28.982 --> 00:48:30.783
Do not worry about it ever again.

595
00:48:31.783 --> 00:48:33.223
Count to 200.

596
00:48:33.482 --> 00:48:36.323
I shall come back before the end of the count.

597
00:48:36.892 --> 00:48:38.093
One.

598
00:48:39.763 --> 00:48:40.923
Two.

599
00:48:42.962 --> 00:48:44.093
Three.

600
00:48:47.903 --> 00:48:49.162
I'm counting too fast.

601
00:48:50.403 --> 00:48:51.473
I should do it again.

602
00:48:54.703 --> 00:48:55.772
One.

603
00:48:59.272 --> 00:49:00.312
Two.

604
00:49:08.352 --> 00:49:12.053
I would have learned how to treat others...

605
00:49:12.093 --> 00:49:13.692
if I had not been born as a slave.

606
00:49:13.763 --> 00:49:15.962
I know that there is a war going on right now.

607
00:49:16.433 --> 00:49:18.962
There are a lot of sick children.

608
00:49:19.363 --> 00:49:21.363
Now is the time of war.

609
00:49:22.602 --> 00:49:25.502
There must be a reason why that container chose you.

610
00:49:37.153 --> 00:49:38.812
I'll keep it in my heart.

611
00:49:41.252 --> 00:49:42.823
Your true self.

612
00:49:43.593 --> 00:49:44.823
Then tell me.

613
00:49:45.493 --> 00:49:47.223
What did you have in mind...

614
00:49:48.093 --> 00:49:50.892
when you cared for and treated those people...

615
00:49:51.692 --> 00:49:53.133
even though you wouldn't benefit from it?

616
00:50:17.892 --> 00:50:20.022
There are so many stars in the sky here.

617
00:50:21.223 --> 00:50:23.692
There were so many stars in the sky in Joseon.

618
00:50:24.692 --> 00:50:25.962
The sky was so dark...

619
00:50:28.363 --> 00:50:30.133
in Seoul.

620
00:50:32.433 --> 00:50:34.002
There aren't any here.

621
00:50:56.562 --> 00:50:57.792
Is it Jae Sook?

623
00:51:42.973 --> 00:51:45.643
Hi, Yeon Kyung. Good morning.

624
00:51:45.973 --> 00:51:47.984
I am making rice balls at the moment.

625
00:51:49.444 --> 00:51:51.614
I shall make you as many as I was supposed to while I was away.

626
00:51:52.013 --> 00:51:53.524
Wait a little.

627
00:52:08.634 --> 00:52:11.274
I told you to wait a little. You are so quick-tempered.

628
00:52:13.574 --> 00:52:14.643
Did you save...

629
00:52:16.944 --> 00:52:18.114
Yeon Yi?

630
00:52:19.373 --> 00:52:21.714
Thanks to you, I did.

631
00:52:27.524 --> 00:52:28.654
Thank goodness.

632
00:52:29.654 --> 00:52:32.194
Whom else did you save?

633
00:52:33.493 --> 00:52:35.663
I treated Doo Chil and his army colleagues...

634
00:52:36.424 --> 00:52:37.634
thanks to you.

635
00:52:39.964 --> 00:52:41.904
Doo Chil has become a soldier.

636
00:52:41.904 --> 00:52:44.634
He swung that sward of his so recklessly...

637
00:52:45.533 --> 00:52:47.674
that the Japanese soldiers were knocked out.

638
00:52:48.504 --> 00:52:50.314
Did you encounter Japanese soldiers again?

639
00:52:51.774 --> 00:52:53.013
What about Mak Gae?

640
00:52:53.984 --> 00:52:55.344
How is she?

641
00:52:57.083 --> 00:52:58.114
She was...

642
00:52:58.884 --> 00:53:00.783
in men's clothes again.

643
00:53:01.623 --> 00:53:03.953
She said she felt more comfortable in those clothes.

644
00:53:04.794 --> 00:53:06.154
How is Master Heo Jun?

645
00:53:08.424 --> 00:53:09.833
Is he well?

646
00:53:10.993 --> 00:53:12.064
That old man.

647
00:53:12.533 --> 00:53:14.103
He must worry about you so much,

648
00:53:15.433 --> 00:53:17.074
but he never expressed it.

649
00:53:23.004 --> 00:53:24.074
And?

650
00:53:41.893 --> 00:53:43.123
I missed you.

00:54:18.694 --> 00:54:19.864
(Shinhae Hospital)

652
00:54:19.864 --> 00:54:23.004
Why did you have to go through such a thing when I was away?

653
00:54:23.103 --> 00:54:26.674
Things must've been more of a hectic if you had been here.

654
00:54:27.544 --> 00:54:30.444
Yeon Kyung made all the fuss.

655
00:54:30.444 --> 00:54:32.674
It was so embarrassing.

656
00:54:34.714 --> 00:54:37.254
She must've suffered a lot.

657
00:54:37.553 --> 00:54:38.654
You brat.

658
00:54:39.154 --> 00:54:42.183
You were worried about her, not me.

659
00:54:42.183 --> 00:54:43.754
Is it not obvious?

660
00:54:43.993 --> 00:54:45.654
She is my first priority.

661
00:54:45.654 --> 00:54:48.763
Brat, I fed you and provided you a place to stay.

662
00:54:48.763 --> 00:54:50.564
I worked without any pay.

663
00:54:50.564 --> 00:54:51.663
There you go.

664
00:54:53.064 --> 00:54:55.663
87 dollars. Are you never going to pay that back to me?

665
00:55:00.473 --> 00:55:03.774
Take her out and feed her something.

666
00:55:04.473 --> 00:55:07.344
She must be exhausted from worrying about me...

667
00:55:07.614 --> 00:55:08.944
for a few days.

668
00:55:15.024 --> 00:55:16.824
You made the right decision to go through a surgery.

669
00:55:16.953 --> 00:55:19.553
I feel much at ease now.

670
00:55:22.364 --> 00:55:23.794
Not to mention...

671
00:55:24.694 --> 00:55:27.163
that you suffered physically there,

672
00:55:27.263 --> 00:55:29.103
but seeing how you look so drawn,

673
00:55:29.504 --> 00:55:32.333
you must have been through a lot.

674
00:55:35.004 --> 00:55:38.243
And it seems like you've finished everything you needed to do.

675
00:55:45.413 --> 00:55:47.223
Yeon Kyung...

676
00:55:48.484 --> 00:55:50.294
is strong.

677
00:55:51.493 --> 00:55:52.553
You should...

678
00:55:53.294 --> 00:55:56.424
take care of your own heart.

679
00:56:25.694 --> 00:56:27.263
Let's have rice balls together.

680
00:56:38.433 --> 00:56:40.473
I do not need to eat.

681
00:56:41.444 --> 00:56:44.243
When I ate them in Joseon, it looked really nice.

682
00:56:45.674 --> 00:56:48.413
I was in a hurry because I wanted to come here quickly.

683
00:56:48.413 --> 00:56:49.413
I am sorry.

684
00:56:51.453 --> 00:56:52.654
It's still delicious.

685
00:56:53.723 --> 00:56:54.953
That's a relief.

686
00:56:59.353 --> 00:57:02.024
You should eat slowly.

687
00:57:02.824 --> 00:57:04.794
I told you to eat slowly.

688
00:57:07.833 --> 00:57:08.864
I...

689
00:57:12.473 --> 00:57:14.103
Gosh, are you all right?

690
00:57:14.473 --> 00:57:15.944
You should have been careful.

691
00:57:16.004 --> 00:57:19.044
Usually, boyfriends open these cans for their girlfriends.

692
00:57:19.984 --> 00:57:21.844
I am sorry.

693
00:57:22.884 --> 00:57:24.453
I am not used to them yet.

694
00:57:32.993 --> 00:57:34.364
How is Joseon?

695
00:57:37.893 --> 00:57:40.333
The Japanese soldiers have conquered Hanyang.

696
00:57:41.464 --> 00:57:42.904
How about the people?

697
00:57:42.904 --> 00:57:44.933
I saw people who could not run away...

698
00:57:44.933 --> 00:57:47.074
being killed mercilessly.

699
00:57:48.844 --> 00:57:50.774
But I could not do anything...

700
00:57:52.214 --> 00:57:54.683
but watch like a fool.

701
00:57:55.814 --> 00:57:57.183
That must have...

702
00:57:58.853 --> 00:57:59.924
hurt a lot.

703
00:57:59.924 --> 00:58:02.623
And while I was just watching, a doctor chose to go...

704
00:58:02.853 --> 00:58:05.154
the rough path instead of an easier path.

705
00:58:05.393 --> 00:58:08.393
A servant pulled out his sword in order to protect others.

706
00:58:08.723 --> 00:58:10.194
And a child...

707
00:58:10.794 --> 00:58:13.603
was more concerned about other kids than herself.

708
00:58:15.333 --> 00:58:17.074
That is how it is like in Joseon.

709
00:58:22.044 --> 00:58:23.413
But here,

710
00:58:24.114 --> 00:58:26.143
people are still busy, and there are...

711
00:58:26.944 --> 00:58:28.783
still so much fine dust here.

712
00:58:31.154 --> 00:58:32.884
These two worlds are so different.

713
00:58:36.853 --> 00:58:40.024
I have something I need to tell you.

714
00:58:45.594 --> 00:58:48.004
Yes? It's Choi Yeon Kyung.

715
00:58:49.564 --> 00:58:50.933
Yes, I'll be right back.

716
00:58:52.734 --> 00:58:53.873
It's from the emergency room.

717
00:58:53.873 --> 00:58:55.944
You should go.

718
00:58:58.774 --> 00:59:00.714
It could be something urgent.

719
00:59:00.714 --> 00:59:03.083
I am fine. You should go.

720
00:59:13.053 --> 00:59:15.763
You should go.

721
00:59:33.714 --> 00:59:34.844
Are you leaving?

722
00:59:35.044 --> 00:59:37.183
There is someone I need to see.

723
00:59:37.183 --> 00:59:38.884
Have you made your decision?

724
00:59:41.623 --> 00:59:44.824
If you come back, you will not be able to go back.

725
01:00:16.594 --> 01:00:17.594
What's wrong with him?

726
01:00:17.594 --> 01:00:19.353
He's having difficulty breathing.

727
01:00:19.353 --> 01:00:20.623
How is he doing?

728
01:01:12.513 --> 01:01:14.814
May I try?

729
01:01:15.114 --> 01:01:16.114
Then...

730
01:01:16.884 --> 01:01:18.183
can I try?

731
01:01:26.024 --> 01:01:28.623
People need to be...

732
01:01:28.623 --> 01:01:32.364
where they belong.

733
01:01:32.663 --> 01:01:35.603
That's where they belong...

734
01:01:35.933 --> 01:01:39.234
and shine the most.

735
01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:37.964
I do not know what more is left,

736
01:02:38.663 --> 01:02:40.303
but it is still in my hands.

737
01:02:41.033 --> 01:02:43.103
I wonder what awaits me...

738
01:02:43.674 --> 01:02:45.274
at the end of this strange destiny.

739
01:02:49.203 --> 01:02:50.274
Life.

740
01:03:01.254 --> 01:03:02.654
Gosh, you are here.

741
01:03:02.984 --> 01:03:04.553
I must have fallen asleep.

742
01:03:07.464 --> 01:03:08.794
Do you want to go somewhere?

743
01:03:10.533 --> 01:03:12.564
Let's go to a place in Seoul that has the most people.

744
01:03:18.404 --> 01:03:20.574
- Is this your first time? - It is.

745
01:03:21.774 --> 01:03:22.774
This...

746
01:03:25.814 --> 01:03:27.683
Look at that.

747
01:03:48.203 --> 01:03:49.973
When did people make this?

748
01:03:50.634 --> 01:03:52.004
I don't know.

749
01:03:52.004 --> 01:03:53.873
But when its color is blue,

750
01:03:53.873 --> 01:03:56.103
it means that the weather is nice today.

751
01:04:12.754 --> 01:04:13.993
Look at the mirror.

752
01:04:20.663 --> 01:04:22.303
Say it loudly.

753
01:04:22.303 --> 01:04:23.774
I love you.

754
01:04:27.643 --> 01:04:28.643
Four.

755
01:04:30.873 --> 01:04:32.413
You got everything.

756
01:04:34.513 --> 01:04:35.683
I succeeded!

757
01:05:11.353 --> 01:05:12.654
Im...

758
01:05:14.524 --> 01:05:15.553
and Kyung.

759
01:05:18.853 --> 01:05:20.064
Im and Kyung.

760
01:05:53.864 --> 01:05:55.893
I have something to tell you.

761
01:05:59.594 --> 01:06:02.663
I do not think I will be able to tell you if it is not now.

762
01:06:33.263 --> 01:06:34.633
I am sorry.

763
01:06:51.353 --> 01:06:52.584
Thank you...

764
01:06:56.454 --> 01:06:57.893
for returning.

765
01:07:03.024 --> 01:07:04.194
Thank you...

766
01:07:05.564 --> 01:07:07.064
for letting me say...

767
01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:10.274
goodbye to you.

768
01:07:13.603 --> 01:07:15.074
Now, you should go back to...

769
01:07:17.874 --> 01:07:19.774
where you should be.

770
01:07:26.284 --> 01:07:28.324
I will protect Seoul.

771
01:07:29.954 --> 01:07:32.393
You should protect Joseon.

772
01:07:40.864 --> 01:07:42.064
Let's...

773
01:07:45.433 --> 01:07:47.444
go separate ways now.

774
01:07:48.343 --> 01:07:49.404
Let's.

775
01:07:56.013 --> 01:07:57.353
For real.

776
01:08:45.834 --> 01:08:48.463
(Live Up To Your Name, Dr. Heo/Deserving of the Name)

777
01:08:48.864 --> 01:08:51.673
My world where I left you by yourself.

778
01:08:51.774 --> 01:08:54.803
Thank you for being with me on this strange destiny.

779
01:08:56.404 --> 01:08:57.744
How many deaths...

780
01:08:57.973 --> 01:09:00.584
have you faced today?

781
01:09:01.084 --> 01:09:03.213
I cannot stop this journey...

782
01:09:03.314 --> 01:09:05.053
because there are people...

783
01:09:05.284 --> 01:09:08.524
who do not give up and wait for me.

784
01:09:08.984 --> 01:09:11.553
Are you okay?

785
01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:14.963
Are you doing okay?
