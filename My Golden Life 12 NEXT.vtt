00:00:07.288 --> 00:00:10.147
What's that scar on your foot?

2
00:00:10.147 --> 00:00:11.457
Oh, this?

3
00:00:11.588 --> 00:00:13.887
I got stitches when I was a kid.

4
00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:16.057
The coke bottle lid was so sharp.

5
00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:18.728
She fell while rubbing against it.

6
00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.967
How would a one-year-old's bones bare that?

7
00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:26.597
How would a one-year-old's bones bare that?

8
00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:28.708
When I was a year old,

9
00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:31.038
it was 1991.

10
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:33.638
Eun Seok went missing...

11
00:00:33.907 --> 00:00:37.348
in August, 1992. Three years old.

12
00:00:38.477 --> 00:00:41.288
If I hurt my foot in 1991,

13
00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:45.458
I...

14
00:00:47.288 --> 00:00:48.687
can't be...

15
00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:51.628
Choi Eun Seok.

16
00:00:54.197 --> 00:00:55.297
Eun Seok.

17
00:00:56.297 --> 00:00:57.367
Eun Seok.

18
00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:02.337
I said, let's go.

19
00:01:02.507 --> 00:01:04.807
Yes. Let's... Let's go.

20
00:01:11.048 --> 00:01:12.247
Stop. Stop.

21
00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:14.988
What are you doing, Dad? Why are you untying that?

22
00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:16.917
It's about time now.

23
00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:20.318
You should still see a doctor to do that.

24
00:01:20.357 --> 00:01:22.988
Gosh, this isn't worth that.

25
00:01:22.988 --> 00:01:24.158
- It's fine. - No.

26
00:01:24.658 --> 00:01:26.598
Then I'll do it for you, okay?

27
00:01:27.397 --> 00:01:28.568
Will you?

28
00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.738
What was that? You don't need to ask me.

29
00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:35.208
Done.

30
00:01:35.507 --> 00:01:37.107
Move to see if you're fine.

31
00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:40.507
- Does it hurt? - No.

32
00:01:40.607 --> 00:01:43.208
It's all good now.

33
00:01:43.807 --> 00:01:44.848
Dad.

34
00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:47.617
How could you hit my head when you know I'm stupid?

35
00:01:48.417 --> 00:01:52.257
Gosh. Now, my right wrist hurts.

36
00:01:53.557 --> 00:01:54.788
Carrying this...

37
00:01:55.128 --> 00:01:57.897
must have caused that.

38
00:01:57.897 --> 00:01:59.158
What's this?

39
00:02:04.798 --> 00:02:08.438
It's an oven to bake bread at home.

40
00:02:08.908 --> 00:02:11.707
Dad, you bought this for me?

41
00:02:12.207 --> 00:02:13.808
Yes. It's not much though.

42
00:02:13.977 --> 00:02:16.007
I'll buy you a better one next time.

43
00:02:16.278 --> 00:02:18.348
No. This is enough.

44
00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:21.348
I asked Mom to get one before,

45
00:02:21.447 --> 00:02:23.748
but she said there's no room in the kitchen.

46
00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:26.987
I'll make some room for it.

47
00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:31.028
Why? You said I can't bake bread at home.

48
00:02:31.058 --> 00:02:32.898
No one can stop you.

49
00:02:33.257 --> 00:02:35.427
You're even working at a bakery.

50
00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:38.667
What's gotten into Mom?

51
00:02:38.968 --> 00:02:41.507
It's just that she's given in to you.

52
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:44.177
Parents have a soft spot for their children indeed.

53
00:02:45.177 --> 00:02:46.737
Let's go. I'll help you.

54
00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:50.447
Thank you, Dad.

55
00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:55.088
Don't mention it. It really isn't much.

56
00:02:55.517 --> 00:02:56.818
That's not it.

57
00:02:57.318 --> 00:02:59.058
For accepting my dream.

58
00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:00.628
For acknowledging it.

59
00:03:01.288 --> 00:03:02.727
I'm so happy.

60
00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:11.751
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

61
00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:16.137
Are you tired all of a sudden?

62
00:03:16.908 --> 00:03:18.107
You're so quiet now.

63
00:03:19.707 --> 00:03:22.207
Do you remember me when I was young?

64
00:03:22.748 --> 00:03:23.917
When?

65
00:03:24.677 --> 00:03:26.818
Like my first birthday party.

66
00:03:26.818 --> 00:03:28.517
What did I choose at my first birthday party?

67
00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:32.088
I even forgot about locking you up in a cage.

68
00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:33.618
But your first birthday party?

69
00:03:34.288 --> 00:03:35.658
Honestly, I don't remember it.

70
00:03:36.558 --> 00:03:39.797
We need to keep talking to bring back the memories.

71
00:03:40.427 --> 00:03:41.767
But I wasn't allowed...

72
00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:43.498
to even say your name after we lost you.

73
00:03:44.368 --> 00:03:47.838
Maybe the voice of you calling me?

74
00:03:49.107 --> 00:03:50.577
I'm not sure if it was at a hospital or home,

75
00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:53.707
but I remember seeing you when you were born.

76
00:03:53.947 --> 00:03:55.047
It's faint.

77
00:03:56.348 --> 00:03:57.417
Why do you ask?

78
00:03:58.278 --> 00:03:59.517
Well,

79
00:04:00.378 --> 00:04:03.188
you were eight years old at that time.

80
00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:07.088
My first memory is from when I was six years old.

81
00:04:07.528 --> 00:04:09.028
My first day of kindergarten.

82
00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:18.367
You chose your pride again...

83
00:04:18.768 --> 00:04:20.968
over something so important.

84
00:04:22.237 --> 00:04:23.508
Pride?

85
00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:25.908
What if Eun Seok didn't call Do Kyung?

86
00:04:26.877 --> 00:04:29.408
What if Eun Seok didn't know anything about art?

87
00:04:30.247 --> 00:04:34.218
She could've stood there in a dusty outfit...

88
00:04:34.288 --> 00:04:37.458
being pointed at and ridiculed by others.

89
00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:42.288
I trusted Eun Seok with my instincts.

90
00:04:43.328 --> 00:04:44.658
She's my daughter.

91
00:04:45.698 --> 00:04:47.297
It could've influenced our company's reputation.

92
00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:49.567
It was our plan to protect her...

93
00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:51.098
from all gossips and rumors.

94
00:04:51.937 --> 00:04:54.138
Can you find out who leaked our secret?

95
00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.508
I'll have to work on it.

96
00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:02.078
We're home.

97
00:05:02.448 --> 00:05:03.448
Come in.

98
00:05:06.718 --> 00:05:08.518
I though you left early. Why are you so late?

99
00:05:10.218 --> 00:05:11.218
Eun Seok.

100
00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:13.158
Are you not well?

101
00:05:13.158 --> 00:05:14.927
I think she was very nervous.

102
00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:16.487
She doesn't even want to have dinner.

103
00:05:16.788 --> 00:05:18.297
I understand how you must've felt.

104
00:05:18.758 --> 00:05:20.427
Go upstairs, and rest.

105
00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:21.667
Get some sleep,

106
00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:23.167
and have dinner when you're hungry.

107
00:05:23.627 --> 00:05:24.698
Okay.

108
00:05:25.437 --> 00:05:26.898
I'll go up now.

109
00:05:28.107 --> 00:05:29.237
Get some rest.

110
00:05:35.047 --> 00:05:37.417
Mom, what happened?

111
00:05:37.518 --> 00:05:39.917
How did they know we found Eun Seok?

112
00:05:39.917 --> 00:05:41.917
We'll take care of that.

113
00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:43.547
You should go up and rest too.

114
00:05:44.258 --> 00:05:46.317
You did a good job today.

115
00:05:46.758 --> 00:05:48.958
Let me know if you need me.

116
00:05:49.528 --> 00:05:50.598
Goodnight.

117
00:06:05.607 --> 00:06:08.047
(Mom from Daebang-dong)

118
00:06:15.648 --> 00:06:16.648
(Ji An)

119
00:06:23.427 --> 00:06:24.427
(Power off)

120
00:06:25.997 --> 00:06:29.367
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

121
00:06:30.297 --> 00:06:32.737
Why did Mom turn off her phone?

122
00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:40.278
General Manager Min.

123
00:06:40.747 --> 00:06:42.708
Should we prepare your dinner as well?

124
00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:44.648
No, I really don't have an appetite.

125
00:06:45.617 --> 00:06:47.487
I'd like to drink a cup of iced water.

126
00:06:47.788 --> 00:06:49.888
- Bring us iced water. - Yes, ma'am.

127
00:06:50.617 --> 00:06:53.388
Don't come down. Call us to bring you iced water.

128
00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:56.658
When you were looking for me,

129
00:06:57.598 --> 00:06:59.658
how did you know it was me?

130
00:06:59.927 --> 00:07:03.598
Did she ask my mom in Daebang-dong?

131
00:07:03.937 --> 00:07:05.937
We had a DNA test first.

132
00:07:06.797 --> 00:07:08.607
You ran a DNA test?

133
00:07:08.607 --> 00:07:10.408
How could we have not?

134
00:07:11.078 --> 00:07:13.638
With what? I don't remember the test.

135
00:07:13.877 --> 00:07:15.648
We have our own methods.

136
00:07:20.177 --> 00:07:22.088
Tell Senior Manager... No.

137
00:07:22.088 --> 00:07:24.088
Tell Vice President Choi that his dinner is ready.

138
00:07:24.088 --> 00:07:25.317
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:07:27.588 --> 00:07:29.227
You left out the red chili pepper, right?

140
00:07:29.227 --> 00:07:30.357
Yes, I did.

141
00:07:39.067 --> 00:07:42.338
Do you think...

142
00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:46.538
I can fool them?

143
00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:48.448
That's right.

144
00:07:49.278 --> 00:07:51.247
There's no way she could have deceived them.

145
00:08:01.187 --> 00:08:03.788
How would a one-year-old's bones bare that?

146
00:08:04.698 --> 00:08:07.427
How would a two-year-old's bones bare that?

147
00:08:08.828 --> 00:08:11.698
How would a one-year-old's bones bare that?

148
00:08:31.357 --> 00:08:32.518
What's this?

149
00:08:35.858 --> 00:08:36.858
(Check for 1,000 dollars)

150
00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:41.297
Did we have to come all the way here to talk?

151
00:08:41.297 --> 00:08:42.797
There are many cafes nearby.

152
00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:45.067
Go get me some coffee. Then I'll tell you why.

153
00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:55.108
So that's why he wanted me to buy him coffee.

154
00:08:56.278 --> 00:08:58.317
That was so long ago.

155
00:08:58.978 --> 00:09:00.788
Hyuk must have been worried sick.

156
00:09:06.118 --> 00:09:07.957
Oh, right. His number.

157
00:09:10.128 --> 00:09:11.528
What should I do?

158
00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:23.768
I'm sorry for being so late.

159
00:09:24.837 --> 00:09:26.508
Why is your makeup so thick?

160
00:09:27.478 --> 00:09:29.207
Since it's his first day as the vice president,

161
00:09:29.207 --> 00:09:31.248
I did so for a change of pace.

162
00:09:32.817 --> 00:09:34.917
Do it over. You look shallow.

163
00:09:35.748 --> 00:09:36.748
Okay.

164
00:09:37.417 --> 00:09:40.057
Congratulations on your first day.

165
00:09:41.057 --> 00:09:43.028
You were promoted earlier than scheduled,

166
00:09:43.028 --> 00:09:44.728
but that's no reason for you to behave rashly.

167
00:09:45.498 --> 00:09:47.998
Don't let your title influence you.

168
00:09:49.697 --> 00:09:52.368
When you go in, say hello to the president first.

169
00:09:53.097 --> 00:09:54.238
I will do that.

170
00:09:55.908 --> 00:09:57.508
And Eun Seok,

171
00:09:57.508 --> 00:10:00.408
you must treat him as your supervisor at work.

172
00:10:00.408 --> 00:10:01.807
Yes, I will.

173
00:10:03.807 --> 00:10:05.118
Let's eat.

174
00:10:07.888 --> 00:10:09.018
Mother,

175
00:10:09.118 --> 00:10:11.658
please show me pictures of me when I lived here.

176
00:10:11.658 --> 00:10:12.858
I'm curious.

177
00:10:13.888 --> 00:10:16.758
We don't have a single photo of you left.

178
00:10:17.128 --> 00:10:18.927
Your grandfather got rid of them...

179
00:10:18.927 --> 00:10:20.667
so we could forget about you.

180
00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:23.467
I see.

181
00:10:24.597 --> 00:10:26.498
I was going to ask you this.

182
00:10:26.837 --> 00:10:29.608
Eun Seok, did you bring your album here?

183
00:10:30.337 --> 00:10:33.008
I'd like to see the photos of your childhood.

184
00:10:33.437 --> 00:10:35.608
No, I didn't.

185
00:10:35.608 --> 00:10:37.618
There isn't an album just for me.

186
00:10:38.047 --> 00:10:40.278
Why not?

187
00:10:42.087 --> 00:10:43.488
When we left for Dubai,

188
00:10:44.118 --> 00:10:45.587
they lost all of our photos.

189
00:10:45.817 --> 00:10:47.587
So there is...

190
00:10:47.587 --> 00:10:50.427
a family album since my time in Dubai.

191
00:10:50.697 --> 00:10:54.228
There was an album for me and Ji Soo.

192
00:10:54.927 --> 00:10:55.998
But about that album...

193
00:10:56.998 --> 00:10:59.797
We moved around a lot.

194
00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:02.608
So we don't know when we lost it.

195
00:11:02.738 --> 00:11:04.878
Was it when Mr. Seo's business went bad...

196
00:11:05.038 --> 00:11:07.077
and you had to move around?

197
00:11:08.447 --> 00:11:09.577
Yes.

198
00:11:18.817 --> 00:11:19.817
Welcome.

199
00:11:21.327 --> 00:11:23.528
Today's my first day at Haesung Apparel.

200
00:11:24.057 --> 00:11:25.858
I ask for your support, President Jung.

201
00:11:26.028 --> 00:11:27.697
I should be the one asking for help.

202
00:11:27.697 --> 00:11:30.097
So I can take some time off.

203
00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:32.768
I'll do my best...

204
00:11:32.768 --> 00:11:34.707
to learn a lot from you, Uncle.

205
00:11:38.837 --> 00:11:39.978
What a shame.

206
00:11:40.337 --> 00:11:42.878
I wanted to see Myung Hee breaking into a sweat.

207
00:11:43.978 --> 00:11:46.947
That's fine. Every day is an opportunity for us.

208
00:11:47.347 --> 00:11:49.717
We have all the chances we can ask for.

209
00:11:51.057 --> 00:11:53.187
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

210
00:11:56.587 --> 00:11:57.697
Myung Hee.

211
00:11:59.758 --> 00:12:01.467
Why didn't you call me and say you were coming?

212
00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:02.898
Someone ran their mouth...

213
00:12:02.898 --> 00:12:04.937
and spread news that we have found Eun Seok.

214
00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:07.807
What are you talking about?

215
00:12:08.538 --> 00:12:10.608
Are you saying that the news got leaked?

216
00:12:10.608 --> 00:12:12.008
Admit it or not,

217
00:12:12.008 --> 00:12:13.538
but it must have been you.

218
00:12:14.307 --> 00:12:15.878
I can't believe this.

219
00:12:15.878 --> 00:12:17.518
It wasn't me.

220
00:12:17.518 --> 00:12:20.317
Succeeding the chairman position after Father.

221
00:12:21.347 --> 00:12:25.557
Fine. Go after the position all you want.

222
00:12:25.557 --> 00:12:28.488
Do your best to earn it. I won't stop you.

223
00:12:28.488 --> 00:12:30.028
- Myung Hee. - However,

224
00:12:30.758 --> 00:12:32.758
while you are doing that,

225
00:12:32.927 --> 00:12:34.967
don't you dare harm my children.

226
00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:36.797
Don't you ever leave...

227
00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:38.868
a trace of damage on my children again.

228
00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:43.368
If others even get a whiff of this before the event,

229
00:12:43.368 --> 00:12:45.478
I am going to destroy you, Jung Myung Soo,

230
00:12:45.908 --> 00:12:47.278
and your son.

231
00:12:47.278 --> 00:12:48.978
You're going too far.

232
00:12:49.908 --> 00:12:51.577
There are more people around you...

233
00:12:51.577 --> 00:12:53.378
who also knew that you found Eun Seok.

234
00:12:53.778 --> 00:12:55.347
Think about your employees in your house...

235
00:12:55.347 --> 00:12:57.518
and those who have access to your house.

236
00:13:00.788 --> 00:13:03.998
Father taught you not to roll your eyes...

237
00:13:04.128 --> 00:13:06.728
and raise your voice...

238
00:13:07.467 --> 00:13:09.628
when you are lying.

239
00:13:10.097 --> 00:13:12.697
Remember that, Jin Hee?

240
00:13:19.238 --> 00:13:21.478
Earn that position with your effort.

241
00:13:21.478 --> 00:13:22.707
With your hard work.

242
00:13:23.047 --> 00:13:25.278
Don't play dirty.

243
00:13:29.248 --> 00:13:30.388
I'll be off now.

244
00:13:35.628 --> 00:13:38.457
Gosh, Myung Hee really isn't an easy opponent.

245
00:13:39.457 --> 00:13:41.927
Ji An, did you clean the table?

246
00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:44.437
And you prepared the file for the vice president?

247
00:13:44.437 --> 00:13:45.437
Yes.

248
00:13:45.937 --> 00:13:47.467
Have you boiled the water for tea?

249
00:13:47.467 --> 00:13:48.707
Whatever he asks for,

250
00:13:48.707 --> 00:13:51.077
be ready to bring in hot drinks when he asks.

251
00:13:51.077 --> 00:13:52.108
Yes, sir.

252
00:13:52.778 --> 00:13:54.577
Ji An will be leading the briefing.

253
00:13:54.577 --> 00:13:55.947
She's going to serve tea as well?

254
00:13:59.447 --> 00:14:01.148
I'll prepare the tea.

255
00:14:01.148 --> 00:14:03.087
I need neither tea nor water.

256
00:14:03.648 --> 00:14:05.788
Welcome, Vice President Choi.

257
00:14:05.917 --> 00:14:07.388
I'm the general manager, Lee Jae Hong.

258
00:14:08.327 --> 00:14:11.728
I'd like to say hi to each member...

259
00:14:12.028 --> 00:14:13.398
of the Haesung Apparel Marketing Team.

260
00:14:13.398 --> 00:14:14.467
Yes, sir.

261
00:14:15.628 --> 00:14:17.297
That's Manager Jo Taek Il.

262
00:14:18.868 --> 00:14:20.097
This is Assistant Manager Yang Jung Ah.

263
00:14:21.337 --> 00:14:22.768
This is Ms. Song Mi Won.

264
00:14:23.807 --> 00:14:25.077
This is Mr. Oh Kyung Min.

265
00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:28.478
This is Ms. Yoon Ha Jung.

266
00:14:33.988 --> 00:14:36.118
And this is Ms. Seo Ji An.

267
00:14:40.457 --> 00:14:43.488
This isn't just an event to enjoy our five senses.

268
00:14:43.488 --> 00:14:45.028
Through experiencing indigo natural dyeing,

269
00:14:45.028 --> 00:14:46.427
our company's reputation will improve.

270
00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:48.097
Through the design contest for hand printing,

271
00:14:48.097 --> 00:14:49.898
we can maximize promoting our company.

272
00:14:49.898 --> 00:14:50.898
And the gift coupons...

273
00:14:50.898 --> 00:14:52.937
will lead customers to buy our products.

274
00:14:53.937 --> 00:14:56.638
The proposal has developed into a very detailed one.

275
00:14:56.967 --> 00:14:58.538
We can proceed with this draft.

276
00:14:59.008 --> 00:15:00.108
Thank you.

277
00:15:02.408 --> 00:15:04.278
But I selected this proposal...

278
00:15:04.817 --> 00:15:07.888
when I was in the Strategic Planning Team.

279
00:15:08.547 --> 00:15:10.217
There were three proposals with the same score.

280
00:15:10.957 --> 00:15:12.057
I see.

281
00:15:12.758 --> 00:15:14.457
By the way, why is another person in charge?

282
00:15:15.087 --> 00:15:17.957
From what I remember, it used to be Yoon Ha Jung.

283
00:15:18.697 --> 00:15:20.427
I didn't do that.

284
00:15:20.427 --> 00:15:22.827
It was the general manager who told me to submit it.

285
00:15:29.538 --> 00:15:30.638
Well, about that.

286
00:15:31.077 --> 00:15:34.278
Ji An submitted it when she was a temporary...

287
00:15:34.278 --> 00:15:35.778
and she quit soon after.

288
00:15:35.978 --> 00:15:37.917
But when she re-entered,

289
00:15:38.217 --> 00:15:41.788
she took charge of it again.

290
00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:44.858
Mr. Lee.

291
00:15:45.587 --> 00:15:47.488
Are you saying you fired a temporary staff...

292
00:15:48.158 --> 00:15:49.858
and plagiarized her work?

293
00:15:50.728 --> 00:15:51.927
That's not it.

294
00:15:53.697 --> 00:15:57.067
I couldn't help it since the proposal was so great.

295
00:16:00.138 --> 00:16:01.538
But stealing is a crime.

296
00:16:02.138 --> 00:16:03.408
Is it not, Ms. Yoon?

297
00:16:04.177 --> 00:16:08.108
No, I was just following my boss' order.

298
00:16:08.108 --> 00:16:11.148
Will you do anything your boss tells you to do?

299
00:16:11.478 --> 00:16:13.347
Even if it's stealing?

300
00:16:15.248 --> 00:16:16.417
I am sorry.

301
00:16:17.358 --> 00:16:18.658
Mr. Lee,

302
00:16:19.557 --> 00:16:22.028
have you always been...

303
00:16:22.128 --> 00:16:25.097
treating your staffs forcefully like this?

304
00:16:26.258 --> 00:16:29.228
You didn't ask them to run...

305
00:16:29.597 --> 00:16:31.167
your personal errands, did you?

306
00:16:32.437 --> 00:16:33.868
I will never do it again.

307
00:16:38.978 --> 00:16:41.207
Starting today, I am the vice president.

308
00:16:41.878 --> 00:16:44.618
What do you want me to do with your abusive boss...

309
00:16:44.717 --> 00:16:47.177
and the girl who stole your position?

310
00:16:47.687 --> 00:16:48.917
What could you do?

311
00:16:48.917 --> 00:16:51.317
Should I fire them? Or should I demote them?

312
00:16:51.417 --> 00:16:53.087
They ill-treated my little sister.

313
00:16:53.187 --> 00:16:54.827
You can't do that.

314
00:16:54.827 --> 00:16:57.028
What do you mean? Am I supposed to leave them be?

315
00:16:57.028 --> 00:16:58.628
That's taking revenge on them.

316
00:16:59.057 --> 00:17:00.728
If I take revenge because I now have power,

317
00:17:00.768 --> 00:17:02.067
I would be just like them.

318
00:17:03.427 --> 00:17:04.698
It's partly my fault...

319
00:17:05.367 --> 00:17:08.238
for letting Mr. Lee treat me the way he did.

320
00:17:09.307 --> 00:17:10.468
And about Ha Jung...

321
00:17:11.508 --> 00:17:13.137
I don't want to be the same person as her.

322
00:17:14.647 --> 00:17:15.647
Do you mean that?

323
00:17:19.617 --> 00:17:22.617
It sounds all very odd, doesn't it?

324
00:17:23.488 --> 00:17:25.958
"I am sorry." "I won't do it again."

325
00:17:27.018 --> 00:17:28.587
Why do you apologize only to me?

326
00:17:29.627 --> 00:17:32.297
Shouldn't you be saying that to Ji An?

327
00:17:38.367 --> 00:17:40.807
Mr. Lee. Ms. Yoon.

328
00:17:41.668 --> 00:17:43.607
You got caught stealing another person's work.

329
00:17:44.337 --> 00:17:45.678
Aren't you going to apologize?

330
00:17:52.117 --> 00:17:53.918
I am sorry.

331
00:17:54.317 --> 00:17:55.688
Shouldn't you look at her?

332
00:17:56.817 --> 00:17:59.617
You've done her wrong, so you must apologize.

333
00:18:00.057 --> 00:18:01.788
And when you apologize,

334
00:18:02.057 --> 00:18:03.758
you must look into the person's eyes...

335
00:18:03.758 --> 00:18:06.357
and really mean it with all sincerity.

336
00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:14.907
I am really sorry, Ms. Seo.

337
00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:20.107
Ms. Seo, I sincerely apologize.

338
00:18:21.877 --> 00:18:22.978
Ms. Seo,

339
00:18:23.407 --> 00:18:24.778
will you accept their apologies?

340
00:18:24.778 --> 00:18:26.147
Yes, I will.

341
00:18:26.748 --> 00:18:30.587
And since I got the proposal back,

342
00:18:30.887 --> 00:18:35.357
I hope you will put this behind now, sir.

343
00:18:37.428 --> 00:18:39.458
Okay. Sit down then.

344
00:18:40.897 --> 00:18:42.268
We will end today's meeting here.

345
00:18:42.998 --> 00:18:45.097
Is there anything else you want to say to me?

346
00:18:45.498 --> 00:18:47.968
I have something to suggest.

347
00:18:47.968 --> 00:18:50.107
Ms. Seo, you should discuss it with me first.

348
00:18:50.107 --> 00:18:51.337
Go ahead.

349
00:18:51.478 --> 00:18:53.137
- Go ahead. - Thank you.

350
00:18:53.238 --> 00:18:56.008
I think we should move up the date of our event...

351
00:18:56.008 --> 00:18:57.617
for the 40th anniversary of our company.

352
00:18:57.978 --> 00:19:00.248
As you know, I planned the program...

353
00:19:00.248 --> 00:19:01.688
in a way that the event will...

354
00:19:01.688 --> 00:19:03.047
positively affect the sales of our products.

355
00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.518
But if we hold the event in December,

356
00:19:05.557 --> 00:19:07.117
it won't be timely...

357
00:19:07.117 --> 00:19:08.587
for the launching of our winter products.

358
00:19:09.758 --> 00:19:11.327
That's a great idea.

359
00:19:11.857 --> 00:19:13.228
I will consider it and make the decision.

360
00:19:15.297 --> 00:19:17.468
All right. Well done, everyone.

361
00:19:17.897 --> 00:19:20.337
Bring the proposal to my office, Ms. Seo.

362
00:19:30.778 --> 00:19:32.047
Why is he asking you to come?

363
00:19:32.478 --> 00:19:34.887
Hurry. Hurry off to his office.

364
00:19:35.147 --> 00:19:36.718
- I will be back. - Okay.

365
00:19:38.418 --> 00:19:40.288
You said you knew him.

366
00:19:45.657 --> 00:19:48.468
You can't do this. They'll be suspicious.

367
00:19:49.498 --> 00:19:52.397
How dare you pretend to be close to me?

368
00:19:53.498 --> 00:19:57.137
- What? - It's for work, you see.

369
00:19:57.907 --> 00:19:59.708
Right. Go on.

370
00:20:01.448 --> 00:20:04.047
You suggested the natural dye idea.

371
00:20:04.178 --> 00:20:06.347
Did you contact the dye house?

372
00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:08.047
No. Not yet.

373
00:20:08.647 --> 00:20:11.557
Why? Does it not suit the foundation day event?

374
00:20:11.557 --> 00:20:14.127
No, it suits perfectly. I am just amazed.

375
00:20:14.857 --> 00:20:17.627
- About what? - While studying abroad,

376
00:20:17.627 --> 00:20:19.528
I went to a natural dye exhibition in New York.

377
00:20:19.528 --> 00:20:20.698
The artist's name was Jun Kwang Soo.

378
00:20:20.698 --> 00:20:23.668
Back then, Manhattan was turned upside down.

379
00:20:24.268 --> 00:20:27.607
The color was more than just beautiful.

380
00:20:27.607 --> 00:20:29.008
It was really lovely.

381
00:20:29.407 --> 00:20:32.337
That's when I thought of...

382
00:20:32.337 --> 00:20:34.377
producing naturally dyed premium products.

383
00:20:34.478 --> 00:20:36.147
The pictures were beautiful enough.

384
00:20:36.147 --> 00:20:38.778
I especially loved the dyeing process.

385
00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:40.988
That's why I put it as the opening event.

386
00:20:40.988 --> 00:20:44.018
So I want to go with you when you go for research.

387
00:20:44.117 --> 00:20:46.188
It would be a great start for my new position.

388
00:20:46.518 --> 00:20:48.928
I am going this afternoon.

389
00:20:48.928 --> 00:20:50.797
Are you? Then send me the address.

390
00:20:50.797 --> 00:20:52.827
I can't go with you, so I'll meet you there.

391
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:54.297
Okay.

392
00:20:54.797 --> 00:20:58.367
Right. Why did you do that? You shouldn't have.

393
00:20:58.597 --> 00:21:00.198
How could I not do that?

394
00:21:00.198 --> 00:21:03.708
If you hadn't reentered, they would've taken it.

395
00:21:04.008 --> 00:21:06.038
They would've ruined the company image too.

396
00:21:06.407 --> 00:21:07.948
I'm not doing it just for you.

397
00:21:08.748 --> 00:21:11.178
But you did it in front of everyone,

398
00:21:11.248 --> 00:21:12.478
and I was so embarrassed.

399
00:21:13.218 --> 00:21:14.488
Why are you so soft?

400
00:21:15.647 --> 00:21:17.758
How could you be a member of Haesung like that?

401
00:21:20.018 --> 00:21:21.488
I'm back.

402
00:21:21.758 --> 00:21:24.397
Ms. Seo, what did Mr. Choi say?

403
00:21:24.397 --> 00:21:25.458
Why did he call for you?

404
00:21:27.057 --> 00:21:30.897
He was planning a project with natural dyes.

405
00:21:31.198 --> 00:21:33.867
So he asked me about that.

406
00:21:34.607 --> 00:21:38.478
You got really lucky as soon as you got in.

407
00:21:38.478 --> 00:21:39.938
Don't mention it.

408
00:21:39.938 --> 00:21:43.047
But it is true that you got very lucky.

409
00:21:43.047 --> 00:21:45.918
You're running the event, and the boss supports you.

410
00:21:46.047 --> 00:21:47.387
Mr. Lee,

411
00:21:47.387 --> 00:21:50.018
to do research and choose contractors,

412
00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.857
I will have to work outside quite often.

413
00:21:52.157 --> 00:21:53.357
I told you about that, right?

414
00:21:53.387 --> 00:21:55.387
I am visiting a natural dye house this afternoon.

415
00:21:55.387 --> 00:21:56.758
Of course.

416
00:21:56.788 --> 00:21:58.998
You filled the event with a lot of activities,

417
00:21:58.998 --> 00:22:00.397
so you must be very busy for preparing it.

418
00:22:00.897 --> 00:22:03.367
You may work outside whenever you need to.

419
00:22:04.038 --> 00:22:05.468
Thank you.

420
00:22:14.547 --> 00:22:15.807
Ms. Seo.

421
00:22:16.347 --> 00:22:18.117
Oh, do you want some coffee, sir?

422
00:22:18.117 --> 00:22:20.847
No. No. Not at all.

423
00:22:21.418 --> 00:22:24.758
And don't make my coffee ever again.

424
00:22:26.117 --> 00:22:28.758
Okay. Is there anything you want me to do then?

425
00:22:28.758 --> 00:22:31.127
No. Here.

426
00:22:32.458 --> 00:22:35.597
It's a gift certificate for Chuseok.

427
00:22:35.768 --> 00:22:37.567
We all got one before you came.

428
00:22:38.238 --> 00:22:41.008
So I asked them for one more.

429
00:22:42.107 --> 00:22:43.738
But Chuseok has already passed.

430
00:22:43.738 --> 00:22:45.337
But still,

431
00:22:45.877 --> 00:22:48.847
who would take care of you if I don't?

432
00:22:49.478 --> 00:22:50.847
Take it to your parents.

433
00:22:52.817 --> 00:22:53.887
Thank you.

434
00:22:55.117 --> 00:22:56.248
Let's...

435
00:22:57.218 --> 00:22:59.718
put the past behind.

436
00:23:00.357 --> 00:23:02.688
Let's start anew. Okay?

437
00:23:03.488 --> 00:23:04.597
Okay.

438
00:23:15.438 --> 00:23:17.678
I guess regular employees get these things too.

439
00:23:19.278 --> 00:23:21.347
I never got anything like this when I was temporary.

440
00:23:24.778 --> 00:23:27.077
If I got it when I was here last time,

441
00:23:29.117 --> 00:23:30.918
Mom and Dad would've loved it.

442
00:23:41.668 --> 00:23:43.028
Lovely.

443
00:23:48.407 --> 00:23:50.907
You are ranked number 39.

444
00:23:59.218 --> 00:24:00.418
Choi Seo Hyun!

445
00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:11.758
I must smell foul.

446
00:24:28.407 --> 00:24:29.778
My heart is still pounding.

447
00:24:30.208 --> 00:24:31.547
What's wrong with me?

448
00:24:33.647 --> 00:24:35.488
I was too surprised a while ago.

449
00:24:53.397 --> 00:24:54.938
I am sorry for making you wait.

450
00:24:57.038 --> 00:24:58.137
Never mind.

451
00:24:59.107 --> 00:25:01.678
I didn't get to shower, so I might smell.

452
00:25:02.248 --> 00:25:03.877
May I still drive you?

453
00:25:05.018 --> 00:25:06.418
It was my fault anyway.

454
00:25:06.817 --> 00:25:07.817
Go ahead.

455
00:25:08.788 --> 00:25:09.847
Thank you.

456
00:25:34.147 --> 00:25:35.847
He said he'd wash the car and get here by 1pm.

457
00:25:35.847 --> 00:25:37.107
Why isn't he here yet?

458
00:25:47.528 --> 00:25:48.728
Bingo.

459
00:25:50.057 --> 00:25:52.597
It looks like my sister must run...

460
00:25:52.597 --> 00:25:53.968
to have a meal here.

461
00:25:57.067 --> 00:25:58.597
Now that I am here,

462
00:25:58.738 --> 00:26:00.337
I feel daunted.

463
00:26:05.807 --> 00:26:08.347
My gosh. Can I call her out like this?

464
00:26:15.248 --> 00:26:16.347
Darn it.

465
00:26:36.968 --> 00:26:39.278
Don't you dare run away.

466
00:26:39.337 --> 00:26:40.607
With just one phone call,

467
00:26:40.607 --> 00:26:42.407
you'll be caught before leaving this neighborhood.

468
00:26:42.407 --> 00:26:43.647
My gosh.

469
00:26:43.877 --> 00:26:45.248
You can't threaten me...

470
00:26:45.248 --> 00:26:47.077
just because you got surprised a bit.

471
00:26:47.077 --> 00:26:48.147
Threaten you?

472
00:26:48.587 --> 00:26:50.488
You were taking a peek at my house like a rat.

473
00:26:50.488 --> 00:26:51.488
A rat?

474
00:26:51.988 --> 00:26:53.557
I can't believe this.

475
00:26:54.127 --> 00:26:57.657
You took a peek at me like a rat too.

476
00:26:57.657 --> 00:26:58.728
A rat?

477
00:26:58.728 --> 00:27:00.668
Did you just call me a rat?

478
00:27:01.228 --> 00:27:03.698
You have to be nice to be treated nicely.

479
00:27:05.668 --> 00:27:07.067
How can a daughter of such a great family...

480
00:27:07.067 --> 00:27:09.268
talk like that in such a rude manner?

481
00:27:09.867 --> 00:27:11.238
You don't even know who I am.

482
00:27:11.637 --> 00:27:13.678
What's going on, Ms. Choi?

483
00:27:14.978 --> 00:27:16.377
That man was peeking at my house...

484
00:27:16.377 --> 00:27:18.278
as if he were trying to rob us.

485
00:27:18.278 --> 00:27:20.018
And I fell over because of him.

486
00:27:21.248 --> 00:27:22.647
Hurry, and call the police.

487
00:27:22.647 --> 00:27:23.788
Are you hurt?

488
00:27:24.488 --> 00:27:25.887
Rob you?

489
00:27:26.518 --> 00:27:27.528
Hey.

490
00:27:27.528 --> 00:27:28.627
What?

491
00:27:28.728 --> 00:27:30.028
Watch your mouth.

492
00:27:46.538 --> 00:27:48.478
I was just passing by while looking at houses,

493
00:27:48.478 --> 00:27:50.617
and I looked through the gate out of curiosity.

494
00:27:50.617 --> 00:27:51.678
However,

495
00:27:52.117 --> 00:27:55.718
she took a peek at me at that moment...

496
00:27:55.718 --> 00:27:57.718
- like a rat. - Hey!

497
00:27:58.218 --> 00:28:00.458
We frightened each other.

498
00:28:00.788 --> 00:28:03.387
So I almost had a miscarriage,

499
00:28:03.387 --> 00:28:04.557
and she fell backwards.

500
00:28:05.758 --> 00:28:08.127
When did I take a peek at you like a rat?

501
00:28:08.127 --> 00:28:10.198
I just... I just opened the door.

502
00:28:13.097 --> 00:28:14.708
I just opened the door.

503
00:28:16.307 --> 00:28:17.377
Seriously.

504
00:28:17.678 --> 00:28:19.607
You slowly opened the door,

505
00:28:19.607 --> 00:28:22.678
and we had made eye contact.

506
00:28:24.577 --> 00:28:26.018
Why did you come to this neighborhood?

507
00:28:26.448 --> 00:28:27.887
If you have a clear purpose,

508
00:28:27.887 --> 00:28:29.948
I will just check your ID and end it there.

509
00:28:34.228 --> 00:28:35.688
My purpose is...

510
00:28:36.258 --> 00:28:37.357
This.

511
00:28:37.958 --> 00:28:38.998
This is it.

512
00:28:39.958 --> 00:28:42.127
It's my hobby to take photos of houses.

513
00:28:42.127 --> 00:28:43.827
I'm doing a research for my future house.

514
00:28:44.698 --> 00:28:46.567
Right. This.

515
00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:49.107
This is the house over there.

516
00:28:49.867 --> 00:28:50.907
Okay?

517
00:28:51.238 --> 00:28:53.238
What should I do, Ms. Choi?

518
00:28:56.508 --> 00:28:58.047
We got a video of you,

519
00:28:58.047 --> 00:28:59.617
so I won't let it slide next time.

520
00:29:02.047 --> 00:29:03.418
I will go get changed.

521
00:29:03.688 --> 00:29:04.788
- Okay. - Seriously.

522
00:29:15.597 --> 00:29:17.168
I am worried about my sister.

523
00:29:21.738 --> 00:29:23.438
"For a personal reason,"

524
00:29:23.438 --> 00:29:25.278
"no bread will be baked this afternoon."

525
00:29:25.307 --> 00:29:26.407
"I apologize."

526
00:29:30.107 --> 00:29:32.377
Why did you bake so little today?

527
00:29:32.377 --> 00:29:33.718
Please put this up outside.

528
00:29:35.418 --> 00:29:37.018
Are you not baking this afternoon?

529
00:29:37.018 --> 00:29:38.157
No, I'm not.

530
00:29:38.518 --> 00:29:41.788
Is something wrong? Are you ill?

531
00:29:41.788 --> 00:29:43.258
You don't look so well.

532
00:29:43.258 --> 00:29:45.528
Wrap it up, and go home.

533
00:29:45.528 --> 00:29:46.897
What's wrong?

534
00:29:48.627 --> 00:29:50.097
What's up with him?

535
00:30:03.107 --> 00:30:04.248
Hello.

536
00:30:04.577 --> 00:30:07.047
I've come for my friend, Seo Ji An.

537
00:30:07.047 --> 00:30:08.887
Oh, Mr. Seo's family.

538
00:30:09.147 --> 00:30:10.718
They live down there.

539
00:30:11.288 --> 00:30:12.587
You should go there.

540
00:30:12.688 --> 00:30:13.988
- Thank you, sir. - Go on.

541
00:30:17.028 --> 00:30:18.327
Who is it?

542
00:30:18.428 --> 00:30:20.668
Is this Ms. Seo Ji An's house?

543
00:30:20.668 --> 00:30:22.168
I am Ji An's friend.

544
00:30:25.538 --> 00:30:26.698
- Hello. - Yes.

545
00:30:26.698 --> 00:30:28.307
I am Ji An's high school friend.

546
00:30:28.307 --> 00:30:29.637
My name is Sunwoo Hyuk.

547
00:30:30.208 --> 00:30:31.238
What?

548
00:30:31.837 --> 00:30:33.377
She moved out.

549
00:30:33.508 --> 00:30:35.647
Move? When?

550
00:30:35.778 --> 00:30:37.448
It's been several days.

551
00:30:38.147 --> 00:30:39.978
Then do you know...

552
00:30:40.178 --> 00:30:41.887
where she moved to?

553
00:30:42.218 --> 00:30:45.157
I don't know. I'm going to be late.

554
00:30:50.357 --> 00:30:52.028
Why are you standing in front of my house?

555
00:30:52.028 --> 00:30:53.797
Please leave.

556
00:30:54.028 --> 00:30:55.168
Okay.

557
00:31:00.968 --> 00:31:03.008
My goodness. He's back again.

558
00:31:04.238 --> 00:31:06.178
Why does he keep coming to our neighborhood?

559
00:31:10.778 --> 00:31:12.317
What is he looking for?

560
00:31:25.897 --> 00:31:26.958
I just need five minutes.

561
00:31:26.958 --> 00:31:28.528
I will just deliver this and get back.

562
00:31:28.528 --> 00:31:29.928
- Okay. - Thank you.

563
00:31:31.198 --> 00:31:32.397
Mom.

564
00:31:36.738 --> 00:31:37.877
Mom.

565
00:31:40.907 --> 00:31:43.077
It would've been nice to see her for a moment.

566
00:31:48.087 --> 00:31:49.988
"Ji An was here."

567
00:31:50.488 --> 00:31:52.057
"I became a regular employee..."

568
00:31:52.057 --> 00:31:53.617
"at Haesung Corporation's Marketing Team."

569
00:31:54.357 --> 00:31:56.728
"I got a gift certificate for Chuseok,"

570
00:31:56.728 --> 00:31:58.198
"so I'm leaving it here."

571
00:31:58.198 --> 00:32:00.057
"You should buy some clothes with this."

572
00:32:06.268 --> 00:32:09.038
We don't have a single photo of you left.

573
00:32:10.877 --> 00:32:13.607
I'd like to see the photos of your childhood.

574
00:32:14.877 --> 00:32:16.778
I should get one for them.

575
00:32:28.057 --> 00:32:29.127
What?

576
00:32:29.758 --> 00:32:32.157
Where are my photos?

577
00:32:33.357 --> 00:32:34.797
Look at this. Ji An.

578
00:32:34.797 --> 00:32:36.127
How long has it been?

579
00:32:37.797 --> 00:32:39.698
Look at your pose, Ji An.

580
00:32:39.698 --> 00:32:41.067
You're posing like a boss.

581
00:32:41.067 --> 00:32:44.508
Look at you. You're pretending to be pretty.

582
00:32:44.508 --> 00:32:46.337
- Where? - Look at you.

583
00:32:52.778 --> 00:32:56.688
Why did they throw away Ji Soo and my photos?

584
00:33:23.678 --> 00:33:26.347
I cannot disclose any information...

585
00:33:26.347 --> 00:33:28.317
about our previous employees.

586
00:33:28.317 --> 00:33:30.387
Then where is the general manager...

587
00:33:30.387 --> 00:33:31.688
of the Marketing Team?

588
00:33:34.028 --> 00:33:35.057
Hey!

589
00:33:39.528 --> 00:33:40.728
What are you doing here?

590
00:33:41.198 --> 00:33:43.998
Did you come to find Ji An for 20,000 dollars too?

591
00:33:44.198 --> 00:33:45.438
"Too"?

592
00:33:47.238 --> 00:33:49.038
Did you give Ji An 20,000 dollars?

593
00:33:49.768 --> 00:33:50.778
Wait.

594
00:33:51.577 --> 00:33:53.038
Why do you call her by her first name?

595
00:33:54.448 --> 00:33:57.317
I did it because you did.

596
00:33:58.047 --> 00:33:59.718
You asked if I am here for that too.

597
00:34:00.117 --> 00:34:03.188
Does it mean you gave her 20,000 dollars too?

598
00:34:03.317 --> 00:34:05.057
I asked you first.

599
00:34:05.117 --> 00:34:06.958
Did she not give you 20,000 dollars?

600
00:34:08.757 --> 00:34:10.597
I got 20,000 dollars from her.

601
00:34:10.597 --> 00:34:11.757
Did you?

602
00:34:13.157 --> 00:34:14.327
Thank goodness.

603
00:34:14.827 --> 00:34:16.768
Then what brings you here?

604
00:34:16.768 --> 00:34:19.438
I'm a businessman, so I can be anywhere.

605
00:34:21.668 --> 00:34:23.237
Do you know Ji An's number?

606
00:34:23.237 --> 00:34:24.478
I don't.

607
00:34:27.947 --> 00:34:29.177
Hello.

608
00:34:29.177 --> 00:34:32.847
Can I contact the manager of the marketing team?

609
00:34:32.847 --> 00:34:33.887
Do you know where he went?

610
00:34:33.887 --> 00:34:34.918
I can't disclose...

611
00:34:34.918 --> 00:34:36.418
I guess she cut ties with him well.

612
00:34:39.617 --> 00:34:42.728
Don't let Sunwoo Hyuk in the company, Mr. Yoo.

613
00:34:45.128 --> 00:34:48.827
Who got rid of our photos?

614
00:34:53.867 --> 00:34:56.137
- Hey, Do Kyung. - Where are you?

615
00:34:56.668 --> 00:34:58.108
I am almost there.

616
00:35:04.548 --> 00:35:05.648
I am so sorry.

617
00:35:05.677 --> 00:35:07.648
I should've arrived five minutes earlier,

618
00:35:08.088 --> 00:35:09.648
but I'm five minutes late.

619
00:35:10.387 --> 00:35:14.027
Why did you borrow 20,000 dollars from him?

620
00:35:14.458 --> 00:35:16.188
I mean your male friend.

621
00:35:16.688 --> 00:35:18.157
He came to see you at work today.

622
00:35:18.427 --> 00:35:19.657
Hyuk came to see me?

623
00:35:19.927 --> 00:35:22.568
You got the money from Mom and gave it to me.

624
00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:24.637
Why did you borrow money from him again?

625
00:35:24.637 --> 00:35:26.137
I gave it back to him.

626
00:35:26.838 --> 00:35:28.668
Actually, I didn't even borrow the money.

627
00:35:29.838 --> 00:35:30.907
Really?

628
00:35:35.277 --> 00:35:37.447
Is your first love's name Seo Ji An?

629
00:35:38.177 --> 00:35:39.617
She sent you something.

630
00:35:40.918 --> 00:35:43.117
(Seo Ji An)

631
00:35:47.288 --> 00:35:49.958
You hid it so well that I didn't even know about it.

632
00:35:50.487 --> 00:35:54.597
What you're concerned about won't happen, Hyuk.

633
00:35:54.798 --> 00:35:56.427
I'm doing just fine.

634
00:35:56.827 --> 00:35:59.668
I'm sending the money back to you. Be well.

635
00:36:03.338 --> 00:36:05.407
(Check for 1,000 dollars)

636
00:36:06.838 --> 00:36:08.807
I got 20,000 dollars.

637
00:36:11.318 --> 00:36:12.617
I can't believe this.

638
00:36:13.077 --> 00:36:15.688
What's that? She paid you back already?

639
00:36:16.518 --> 00:36:19.387
But why did she send it by an express delivery?

640
00:36:19.818 --> 00:36:22.387
I have no idea either.

641
00:36:23.728 --> 00:36:26.358
She's so mysterious.

642
00:36:29.228 --> 00:36:32.568
She moved out, and I don't have her number.

643
00:36:33.168 --> 00:36:34.838
I don't even know her email address.

644
00:36:37.637 --> 00:36:38.878
Seo Ji An...

645
00:36:39.608 --> 00:36:40.878
is gone.

646
00:36:43.847 --> 00:36:44.978
You can make dyes with fresh indigo leaves...

647
00:36:44.978 --> 00:36:46.847
only from July to September.

648
00:36:47.077 --> 00:36:48.387
You can't do it in November.

649
00:36:48.588 --> 00:36:50.617
Are only fermented leaves available by then?

650
00:36:50.918 --> 00:36:53.418
Fermented leaves make a beautiful color too.

651
00:36:53.518 --> 00:36:56.288
But I'm interested in using fresh indigo leaves.

652
00:36:56.458 --> 00:36:58.958
Then are the indigo leaves available fresh today?

653
00:36:58.958 --> 00:37:01.467
Yes. By the way, are you aware...

654
00:37:01.467 --> 00:37:04.137
that you can only dye silk with fresh indigo leaves?

655
00:37:04.237 --> 00:37:05.237
I am.

656
00:37:05.237 --> 00:37:08.108
I'm into silk that is dyed with fresh indigo leaves.

657
00:37:39.398 --> 00:37:40.938
It's beautiful.

658
00:37:50.208 --> 00:37:52.847
You should cook it for your family and friends...

659
00:37:52.847 --> 00:37:55.288
and fill out the checklist after tasting it.

660
00:37:55.748 --> 00:37:57.818
You'll have a cook in charge,

661
00:37:57.818 --> 00:38:00.487
but the owner should know how to do it too.

662
00:38:02.458 --> 00:38:04.557
I can ask them to taste it,

663
00:38:05.427 --> 00:38:07.498
but I can't have them fill out this checklist.

664
00:38:11.467 --> 00:38:12.668
Mi Jung.

665
00:38:13.498 --> 00:38:14.768
Hae Ja.

666
00:38:17.777 --> 00:38:20.208
Hae Ja, what's wrong?

667
00:38:20.208 --> 00:38:21.507
Well...

668
00:38:21.907 --> 00:38:25.117
I'm hungry, but I don't want to cook.

669
00:38:25.548 --> 00:38:26.717
Really?

670
00:38:26.818 --> 00:38:30.447
Then come to my place. I'll cook for you.

671
00:38:30.788 --> 00:38:32.757
- Really? - Of course. Come with me.

672
00:38:40.327 --> 00:38:41.867
But why hamburgers?

673
00:38:43.498 --> 00:38:44.637
Just.

674
00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:49.407
Is Haesung opening a restaurant for you?

675
00:38:51.208 --> 00:38:55.177
Haesung FNB's an affiliate of Haesung Group.

676
00:38:55.277 --> 00:38:58.048
Shabu-shabus, buffets, salad restaurants,

677
00:38:58.117 --> 00:38:59.447
and Haesung Hamburgers.

678
00:39:00.277 --> 00:39:01.518
This is it, right?

679
00:39:02.318 --> 00:39:04.557
Well... About that...

680
00:39:06.487 --> 00:39:08.188
I understand now.

681
00:39:08.858 --> 00:39:11.557
So this was why Tae Soo wanted to start business.

682
00:39:11.657 --> 00:39:13.967
He'd definitely not want to take this.

683
00:39:17.398 --> 00:39:18.438
Hae Ja.

684
00:39:19.938 --> 00:39:23.568
Do you think I'm willingly taking this?

685
00:39:27.648 --> 00:39:28.947
Tae Soo...

686
00:39:30.077 --> 00:39:32.077
wasn't working at a distribution center.

687
00:39:34.518 --> 00:39:37.487
He was a daily laborer.

688
00:39:38.688 --> 00:39:39.717
What?

689
00:39:41.958 --> 00:39:43.128
You bought this house...

690
00:39:45.427 --> 00:39:48.228
as you wanted it to be redeveloped.

691
00:39:49.798 --> 00:39:51.998
You'd want it to be redeveloped soon.

692
00:39:53.798 --> 00:39:55.038
But I'm...

693
00:39:55.838 --> 00:39:57.307
living in this house...

694
00:39:57.838 --> 00:39:59.907
at a giveaway price, thanks to you.

695
00:40:01.108 --> 00:40:02.248
But what if...

696
00:40:03.777 --> 00:40:05.818
this area gets redeveloped?

697
00:40:06.617 --> 00:40:08.447
What if they began to tear down this house?

698
00:40:10.088 --> 00:40:11.818
I'd end up in a semi-basement again.

699
00:40:13.117 --> 00:40:14.288
I hope...

700
00:40:15.458 --> 00:40:17.358
this area won't be redeveloped.

701
00:40:18.697 --> 00:40:20.128
That's how I feel.

702
00:40:22.728 --> 00:40:23.827
I'm sorry.

703
00:40:26.068 --> 00:40:27.307
Mi Jung.

704
00:40:29.538 --> 00:40:30.807
Hae Ja, you know what?

705
00:40:32.777 --> 00:40:34.947
I'll be turning 60 soon.

706
00:40:36.407 --> 00:40:39.077
I'd never imagined that I'd live like this.

707
00:40:42.018 --> 00:40:44.487
When they offered me a franchise restaurant,

708
00:40:45.717 --> 00:40:48.657
I refused it immediately and said...

709
00:40:50.128 --> 00:40:51.527
that we can handle ourselves.

710
00:40:53.197 --> 00:40:54.568
But then she told me...

711
00:40:56.628 --> 00:40:57.798
that Tae Soo...

712
00:40:58.398 --> 00:40:59.737
was a daily laborer.

713
00:41:01.668 --> 00:41:03.168
My goodness.

714
00:41:12.818 --> 00:41:14.288
Don't cry.

715
00:41:15.818 --> 00:41:18.217
I know how you feel. I understand.

716
00:41:23.027 --> 00:41:24.628
You will never understand how I feel.

717
00:41:27.867 --> 00:41:29.197
And neither does Tae Soo.

718
00:41:32.097 --> 00:41:33.768
Even I don't understand myself...

719
00:41:35.608 --> 00:41:36.967
about why I did that.

720
00:41:38.338 --> 00:41:40.407
It's okay. This was the right thing to do.

721
00:41:41.208 --> 00:41:44.077
It did cost a lot for you to raise Ji An anyway.

722
00:42:01.197 --> 00:42:02.867
I dozed off.

723
00:42:05.998 --> 00:42:07.467
What's that smell?

724
00:42:10.608 --> 00:42:11.677
Mom.

725
00:42:12.677 --> 00:42:13.907
Ji Soo.

726
00:42:14.208 --> 00:42:15.307
Why are you home now?

727
00:42:15.307 --> 00:42:18.117
My boss closed the shop early today.

728
00:42:18.217 --> 00:42:19.347
Hello.

729
00:42:19.347 --> 00:42:21.048
Did you come down here as you smelled something?

730
00:42:21.387 --> 00:42:22.387
Exactly.

731
00:42:23.447 --> 00:42:25.688
Mom, did you buy this for me?

732
00:42:26.458 --> 00:42:28.288
Well... Yes.

733
00:42:28.327 --> 00:42:30.657
But I had some already.

734
00:42:31.157 --> 00:42:32.228
Have some.

735
00:42:32.757 --> 00:42:34.728
It looks so delicious. Did you eat?

736
00:42:34.998 --> 00:42:37.768
There's more. And I'm not hungry yet.

737
00:42:38.398 --> 00:42:41.237
I'll eat first then.

738
00:42:48.077 --> 00:42:49.347
It's delicious.

739
00:42:50.918 --> 00:42:52.648
Is there anything that's not good to you?

740
00:42:53.018 --> 00:42:54.188
Not really.

741
00:42:56.447 --> 00:42:58.318
It's this hour already?

742
00:42:59.217 --> 00:43:01.487
What do you think? I liked the color.

743
00:43:02.088 --> 00:43:05.027
It was beautiful, but it's not what I expected.

744
00:43:06.358 --> 00:43:08.128
You have one more place to go, right?

745
00:43:08.498 --> 00:43:10.668
I can't be with you there since I have a meeting.

746
00:43:11.168 --> 00:43:12.737
So let's grab a quick bite for dinner.

747
00:43:13.168 --> 00:43:15.367
You'll have dinner during the meeting, won't you?

748
00:43:15.367 --> 00:43:17.507
But I can't have my sister skip a meal like this.

749
00:43:17.737 --> 00:43:19.608
I should have you eat something before you go.

750
00:43:24.347 --> 00:43:25.748
We should open you to the public soon...

751
00:43:25.748 --> 00:43:28.117
so you can have a decent meal with Driver Myung.

752
00:43:28.617 --> 00:43:30.347
I don't mind eating alone.

753
00:43:30.347 --> 00:43:33.557
You should stop it. And stop eating this stuff.

754
00:43:34.358 --> 00:43:36.458
I can't change my eating habits just like that.

755
00:43:37.958 --> 00:43:39.628
This is just so good.

756
00:43:40.057 --> 00:43:43.327
Tasting the flavor of the ingredients is good.

757
00:43:43.938 --> 00:43:45.168
That's what's good for your health.

758
00:43:45.498 --> 00:43:48.038
You just point out flaws at every opportunity.

759
00:43:49.208 --> 00:43:50.807
There's one thing to be praised though.

760
00:43:51.277 --> 00:43:52.538
Sunwoo Hyuk.

761
00:43:52.677 --> 00:43:53.777
Hyuk?

762
00:43:53.777 --> 00:43:56.978
It's good that you broke off contact with him.

763
00:43:57.518 --> 00:43:59.217
Now, you're finally acting like my sister.

764
00:44:00.378 --> 00:44:01.987
Like a true daughter of Haesung Corporation.

765
00:44:12.757 --> 00:44:15.228
What? What's that look on your face?

766
00:44:17.498 --> 00:44:18.768
I just feel reassured.

767
00:44:19.237 --> 00:44:22.268
You're a reliable brother.

768
00:44:24.807 --> 00:44:26.277
You had an older brother in your old family too.

769
00:44:26.777 --> 00:44:28.148
Wasn't he so reliable?

770
00:44:28.248 --> 00:44:29.677
Of course he was.

771
00:44:30.777 --> 00:44:32.177
But when things get difficult,

772
00:44:32.478 --> 00:44:34.987
you just can't afford to care about other people.

773
00:44:50.737 --> 00:44:55.208
Of course. I knew that would happen.

774
00:45:03.248 --> 00:45:06.117
Hey, Seok Doo. Did you get my email?

775
00:45:06.677 --> 00:45:10.757
Well, I sent a few items and details about them.

776
00:45:10.788 --> 00:45:13.818
That? That was just a primary search.

777
00:45:13.818 --> 00:45:15.588
I can find some more.

778
00:45:16.858 --> 00:45:18.027
I'm home.

779
00:45:18.157 --> 00:45:19.358
Yes, what?

780
00:45:20.128 --> 00:45:21.498
Okay then.

781
00:45:22.027 --> 00:45:23.568
See you.

782
00:45:36.748 --> 00:45:37.978
Ji Tae.

783
00:45:43.117 --> 00:45:46.288
They say you can feel someone's absence.

784
00:45:46.717 --> 00:45:48.728
This room feels so empty now.

785
00:45:50.257 --> 00:45:51.458
Why are you up here?

786
00:45:54.427 --> 00:45:57.467
Hey, I heard you were dating someone.

787
00:45:59.838 --> 00:46:00.938
But you broke up.

788
00:46:02.268 --> 00:46:03.608
Who told you?

789
00:46:04.438 --> 00:46:06.478
They said that coughs and love...

790
00:46:06.478 --> 00:46:08.108
cannot be hidden.

791
00:46:08.648 --> 00:46:10.548
You seemed to have been dating her for years.

792
00:46:10.548 --> 00:46:12.947
It would be even more ridiculous if Ji Ho...

793
00:46:12.947 --> 00:46:14.548
didn't notice all that while sharing your room.

794
00:46:16.318 --> 00:46:18.217
Yes, we broke up.

795
00:46:18.858 --> 00:46:20.827
Why did you when you should get married?

796
00:46:22.057 --> 00:46:24.697
Things just happened. It's over now.

797
00:46:25.327 --> 00:46:27.057
You say it's over...

798
00:46:27.057 --> 00:46:29.197
and you walk about like you're moping?

799
00:46:30.228 --> 00:46:31.898
What? You're not rich enough?

800
00:46:32.697 --> 00:46:34.007
Why do you need money?

801
00:46:34.007 --> 00:46:35.708
You just need a room to live together.

802
00:46:37.708 --> 00:46:40.538
Dad, what are you talking about?

803
00:46:41.248 --> 00:46:43.447
So I broke up with my girlfriend.

804
00:46:43.608 --> 00:46:46.318
Why does that lead to money and rent?

805
00:46:47.117 --> 00:46:49.217
Your mom and I lived in a tiny room...

806
00:46:49.487 --> 00:46:51.057
we rented from our landlord...

807
00:46:51.057 --> 00:46:52.788
when we were newlyweds.

808
00:46:53.188 --> 00:46:54.628
That was years ago.

809
00:46:55.157 --> 00:46:56.827
It was just fine.

810
00:46:57.628 --> 00:46:59.657
Was love cheap then,

811
00:46:59.657 --> 00:47:02.298
and has it become more costly now?

812
00:47:03.068 --> 00:47:06.768
You get married to be with someone.

813
00:47:07.467 --> 00:47:08.838
I mean, you know...

814
00:47:10.407 --> 00:47:11.777
that I can't afford it.

815
00:47:12.407 --> 00:47:14.548
Why not? You have this room.

816
00:47:19.978 --> 00:47:22.088
Your mom and I...

817
00:47:22.447 --> 00:47:26.057
won't burden you even after we retire.

818
00:47:26.418 --> 00:47:28.487
So you can start off here, save up,

819
00:47:28.487 --> 00:47:29.887
and then move out.

820
00:47:30.827 --> 00:47:33.557
It's not that simple.

821
00:47:34.697 --> 00:47:36.768
Life can be complicated or simple.

822
00:47:36.768 --> 00:47:39.268
It depends on how you choose to think.

823
00:47:40.608 --> 00:47:43.568
- I know what I'm doing. - What do you know?

824
00:47:46.378 --> 00:47:49.148
Do you think you know everything?

825
00:47:49.507 --> 00:47:52.347
You are 33 years old and all grown up,

826
00:47:52.347 --> 00:47:54.418
so you know more than enough...

827
00:47:54.418 --> 00:47:56.188
to think that you're right.

828
00:47:56.188 --> 00:47:57.518
Isn't that it?

829
00:48:00.018 --> 00:48:01.327
Answer me.

830
00:48:01.327 --> 00:48:03.827
I'm no longer a child.

831
00:48:03.827 --> 00:48:06.427
You think that, and that's why you're immature.

832
00:48:06.628 --> 00:48:08.827
That's why you're still young.

833
00:48:09.327 --> 00:48:11.068
I'm over 60 now,

834
00:48:11.068 --> 00:48:13.097
and even I'm anxious because I'm not so sure...

835
00:48:13.097 --> 00:48:14.467
if I'm right. But you?

836
00:48:16.407 --> 00:48:18.708
It's immature to think you're an adult...

837
00:48:19.137 --> 00:48:20.608
just because you're older.

838
00:48:22.148 --> 00:48:24.217
You don't know what it is that you really need.

839
00:48:24.217 --> 00:48:25.418
You fool.

840
00:48:28.148 --> 00:48:31.217
You may have forgotten because of what I am now,

841
00:48:31.557 --> 00:48:34.027
but I worked in commerce for 15 years...

842
00:48:34.027 --> 00:48:35.657
and ran a business for 10 years.

843
00:48:35.757 --> 00:48:37.358
China, the Middle-east, and Japan.

844
00:48:37.358 --> 00:48:40.057
I lived in other countries like I was born there.

845
00:48:41.467 --> 00:48:42.527
Listen to me.

846
00:48:43.798 --> 00:48:45.398
If you aren't completely sure,

847
00:48:45.998 --> 00:48:47.807
it's best to just take the plunge.

848
00:48:49.867 --> 00:48:51.177
Stop it.

849
00:48:51.407 --> 00:48:53.637
You don't know why I'm doing this.

850
00:48:54.108 --> 00:48:56.048
Times have changed now.

851
00:48:58.248 --> 00:49:01.487
I won't do what I'll regret.

852
00:49:03.958 --> 00:49:05.458
People live...

853
00:49:06.117 --> 00:49:07.788
because of people.

854
00:49:08.757 --> 00:49:11.228
Living together and sharing emotions.

855
00:49:12.757 --> 00:49:14.268
That is what makes us human.

856
00:49:23.237 --> 00:49:24.807
He has no idea.

857
00:49:28.777 --> 00:49:29.777
I'm home.

858
00:49:30.548 --> 00:49:32.018
Eun Seok isn't yet.

859
00:49:32.947 --> 00:49:35.788
She started preparing for the anniversary event.

860
00:49:35.918 --> 00:49:38.018
She's visiting some important vendors.

861
00:49:38.918 --> 00:49:40.588
Everything is as if it was planned.

862
00:49:40.588 --> 00:49:43.788
I can't believe that proposal was hers.

863
00:49:43.998 --> 00:49:46.157
She doesn't have to try too hard.

864
00:49:47.197 --> 00:49:49.097
Are we putting too much pressure on her?

865
00:49:49.097 --> 00:49:51.867
No, she's determined and willing.

866
00:49:52.438 --> 00:49:55.307
We chose a proposal she'd worked so hard on.

867
00:49:55.507 --> 00:49:57.777
I visited a vendor with her today,

868
00:49:57.777 --> 00:49:58.938
and she's good.

869
00:50:00.538 --> 00:50:01.748
I'm so proud of her.

870
00:50:12.057 --> 00:50:13.117
Goodness.

871
00:50:14.757 --> 00:50:15.788
You're late.

872
00:50:16.387 --> 00:50:17.798
You're still up?

873
00:50:17.798 --> 00:50:20.128
It's almost midnight, and my daughter's not home.

874
00:50:20.128 --> 00:50:21.498
How could I sleep?

875
00:50:22.427 --> 00:50:23.628
I'm sorry.

876
00:50:23.967 --> 00:50:26.197
The second vendor had moved.

877
00:50:26.197 --> 00:50:28.168
So I had to go to Yangpyeong.

878
00:50:28.668 --> 00:50:29.768
Take a seat for a moment.

879
00:50:30.538 --> 00:50:31.608
Okay.

880
00:50:34.648 --> 00:50:36.748
We didn't send you to the Marketing Team...

881
00:50:36.748 --> 00:50:38.777
to put you to work.

882
00:50:39.478 --> 00:50:40.478
You know that.

883
00:50:41.217 --> 00:50:43.048
You won't be there for long,

884
00:50:43.048 --> 00:50:44.217
so don't overdo it.

885
00:50:45.918 --> 00:50:47.827
You worked so hard until now.

886
00:50:48.887 --> 00:50:50.597
You deserve a break.

887
00:50:51.927 --> 00:50:54.728
It's okay. I'm enjoying myself.

888
00:50:55.068 --> 00:50:57.798
And I really want to do well.

889
00:50:57.798 --> 00:50:59.168
It's our 40th anniversary.

890
00:51:00.038 --> 00:51:02.507
When will you spare me some time for a date then?

891
00:51:03.307 --> 00:51:05.277
There's something I want to give you.

892
00:51:06.338 --> 00:51:09.507
Some presents that will shock you.

893
00:51:14.048 --> 00:51:16.088
You can give them to me...

894
00:51:16.088 --> 00:51:17.987
after Haesung Apparel's 40th anniversary event.

895
00:51:19.088 --> 00:51:20.117
Is that so?

896
00:51:21.688 --> 00:51:23.358
If you ever feel like...

897
00:51:23.358 --> 00:51:25.597
taking a break or having fun before then,

898
00:51:25.597 --> 00:51:26.657
just let me know.

899
00:51:27.597 --> 00:51:28.628
I will.

900
00:51:36.438 --> 00:51:38.007
- Ji Soo. - Yes?

901
00:51:38.307 --> 00:51:40.907
I might come home late today.

902
00:51:41.277 --> 00:51:43.208
I stir-fried some squid, your favorite.

903
00:51:43.208 --> 00:51:44.878
So eat that later.

904
00:51:45.617 --> 00:51:46.818
You're leaving now...

905
00:51:46.818 --> 00:51:48.447
and won't be back until the evening?

906
00:51:48.447 --> 00:51:49.487
Where are you going?

907
00:51:50.987 --> 00:51:52.088
I'm just going...

908
00:51:52.518 --> 00:51:55.057
to get some air with Hae Ja.

909
00:51:56.327 --> 00:51:57.327
Sorry.

910
00:52:01.398 --> 00:52:03.327
What is she sorry about?

911
00:52:06.237 --> 00:52:08.538
She hasn't been herself since Ji An left.

912
00:52:11.608 --> 00:52:13.538
Good morning.

913
00:52:14.177 --> 00:52:15.978
Why are you here so early?

914
00:52:15.978 --> 00:52:18.318
I wanted to ask you something.

915
00:52:19.447 --> 00:52:22.048
Why are your eyes so puffed up?

916
00:52:22.887 --> 00:52:25.958
I had instant noodles before bed last night.

917
00:52:26.487 --> 00:52:27.858
What's your question?

918
00:52:28.487 --> 00:52:29.927
Well, you see,

919
00:52:30.057 --> 00:52:33.197
the bike guy keeps coming to my neighborhood.

920
00:52:34.197 --> 00:52:35.398
What do you mean?

921
00:52:36.427 --> 00:52:37.668
I wonder...

922
00:52:38.268 --> 00:52:40.268
if he's looking for my house.

923
00:52:40.838 --> 00:52:44.208
Does the bike guy know where you live?

924
00:52:44.208 --> 00:52:47.478
I think he wants to find out.

925
00:52:47.478 --> 00:52:50.248
I haven't seen him at the cafe at all.

926
00:52:50.248 --> 00:52:53.277
How does he know which neighborhood you live in?

927
00:52:54.288 --> 00:52:55.918
He never asked me,

928
00:52:56.048 --> 00:52:58.117
and even I don't know where you live either.

929
00:52:58.458 --> 00:53:00.387
I live in Daebang-dong.

930
00:53:02.427 --> 00:53:03.487
Ji Soo.

931
00:53:04.298 --> 00:53:06.197
It's good to have hope,

932
00:53:06.398 --> 00:53:09.367
but groundless hope becomes a delusion.

933
00:53:12.967 --> 00:53:15.637
Why does he keep coming to my neighborhood then?

934
00:53:16.137 --> 00:53:18.407
I saw him twice already.

935
00:53:19.907 --> 00:53:21.248
Does a relative live nearby?

936
00:53:25.077 --> 00:53:27.347
Hello, good morning.

937
00:53:27.748 --> 00:53:29.217
Hello, good...

938
00:53:34.327 --> 00:53:35.757
If I fail even today,

939
00:53:36.257 --> 00:53:38.228
I am no longer Seo Ji Soo.

940
00:53:39.298 --> 00:53:40.498
Let's do this.

941
00:53:44.637 --> 00:53:46.668
Hello, good...

942
00:53:51.637 --> 00:53:52.708
What was that?

943
00:53:53.608 --> 00:53:54.978
But he saw me.

944
00:53:55.608 --> 00:53:56.907
I'm certain that he saw...

945
00:54:00.788 --> 00:54:02.487
Is he pretending he didn't?

946
00:54:04.088 --> 00:54:05.217
Ji Soo.

947
00:54:05.958 --> 00:54:07.827
It's good to have hope,

948
00:54:08.088 --> 00:54:11.257
but groundless hope becomes a delusion.

949
00:54:13.898 --> 00:54:14.998
Ji Soo.

950
00:54:16.128 --> 00:54:18.068
You're so pathetic.

951
00:54:22.637 --> 00:54:23.768
Hello.

952
00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:28.208
- I brought the bread. - Thank you.

953
00:54:29.277 --> 00:54:32.648
- Goodbye. - Wait.

954
00:54:34.648 --> 00:54:36.248
Stay for a cup of coffee.

955
00:54:36.887 --> 00:54:37.918
What?

956
00:54:44.057 --> 00:54:46.728
How should I pay you for the bread?

957
00:54:47.157 --> 00:54:49.168
May I wire it to your boss?

958
00:54:49.827 --> 00:54:51.898
I'll ask him about that.

959
00:54:55.568 --> 00:54:59.177
You haven't been able to see him recently, right?

960
00:55:00.108 --> 00:55:01.148
What?

961
00:55:02.447 --> 00:55:05.518
He's distracted because of the woman he likes.

962
00:55:06.818 --> 00:55:09.217
Not all men are like him,

963
00:55:09.918 --> 00:55:13.188
but I know him pretty well.

964
00:55:14.588 --> 00:55:16.188
When he cares about someone,

965
00:55:17.027 --> 00:55:19.597
he doesn't let anyone else into his heart.

966
00:55:24.367 --> 00:55:25.498
But...

967
00:55:26.438 --> 00:55:28.438
I think time heals all wounds.

968
00:55:29.967 --> 00:55:31.507
When time passes by,

969
00:55:33.277 --> 00:55:34.878
he will be fine again.

970
00:55:37.847 --> 00:55:40.847
What is she like?

971
00:55:46.788 --> 00:55:48.487
I don't know much,

972
00:55:49.657 --> 00:55:50.827
but she's pretty...

973
00:55:51.298 --> 00:55:52.898
and very smart.

974
00:55:54.228 --> 00:55:58.268
He said she influenced him in a very good way.

975
00:56:00.438 --> 00:56:01.608
I see.

976
00:56:05.007 --> 00:56:07.847
She must suit him very well.

977
00:56:11.177 --> 00:56:15.018
(Suppliers of old games)

978
00:56:21.827 --> 00:56:24.657
Sir, today, I have to visit the game...

979
00:56:24.657 --> 00:56:27.597
Okay, you don't even have to tell me first.

980
00:56:28.597 --> 00:56:30.068
I'm off then.

981
00:56:34.007 --> 00:56:36.307
Hey, when will you arrange the files?

982
00:56:36.608 --> 00:56:37.907
Ha Jung.

983
00:56:38.407 --> 00:56:40.478
When will you finish arranging the files?

984
00:56:41.907 --> 00:56:43.108
Well, about that...

985
00:56:43.108 --> 00:56:45.617
Did you leave it to Ji An because she joined last?

986
00:56:45.617 --> 00:56:48.018
Knowing that she's busy with the 40th year event?

987
00:56:52.458 --> 00:56:55.228
Okay. I'll do it then.

988
00:56:57.157 --> 00:56:58.458
I'll get going.

989
00:57:02.168 --> 00:57:04.068
- Jinx. - What?

990
00:57:05.398 --> 00:57:07.538
I was just about to call you...

991
00:57:07.538 --> 00:57:08.768
when you called me.

992
00:57:09.338 --> 00:57:11.077
Were you? Why?

993
00:57:11.807 --> 00:57:12.807
What about you?

994
00:57:13.637 --> 00:57:17.077
Ji Soo, the day we moved to Daebang-dong.

995
00:57:17.077 --> 00:57:19.717
Do you remember going through our photos?

996
00:57:19.947 --> 00:57:22.487
Of course. We hadn't done that in years.

997
00:57:23.018 --> 00:57:24.818
The Christmas photos we took...

998
00:57:24.818 --> 00:57:26.958
on the year we went to Dubai.

999
00:57:27.458 --> 00:57:29.387
It was there, wasn't it?

1000
00:57:29.588 --> 00:57:32.697
The one with us posing? Yes, what about it?

1001
00:57:36.327 --> 00:57:37.498
Hello... Hello?

1002
00:57:38.538 --> 00:57:40.038
It's... It's nothing.

1003
00:57:40.737 --> 00:57:42.038
Why did you want to call me?

1004
00:57:42.768 --> 00:57:45.338
I'm going to forget all about him.

1005
00:57:45.478 --> 00:57:46.978
I'll stop liking him.

1006
00:57:48.177 --> 00:57:50.108
That's not up to you.

1007
00:57:50.208 --> 00:57:51.648
No, it is.

1008
00:57:52.148 --> 00:57:54.617
I loved him as much as I loved bread,

1009
00:57:55.018 --> 00:57:56.947
but I loved him too much.

1010
00:57:57.257 --> 00:57:59.288
I had too much hope.

1011
00:58:00.418 --> 00:58:02.188
I just realized that it was a delusion.

1012
00:58:02.588 --> 00:58:04.858
What are you talking about?

1013
00:58:05.197 --> 00:58:09.498
It's wrong for wanting him when he has a girlfriend.

1014
00:58:10.228 --> 00:58:12.438
That's why I need to get over him.

1015
00:58:12.938 --> 00:58:15.068
I'll focus on bread now.

1016
00:58:15.608 --> 00:58:17.407
I'll stop being a fool.

1017
00:58:18.307 --> 00:58:19.708
I promise.

1018
00:58:20.208 --> 00:58:22.648
I thought I could do it if I promised to you.

1019
00:58:23.307 --> 00:58:24.617
Okay.

1020
00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:27.288
- I'll hang up then. - Wait, wait.

1021
00:58:27.518 --> 00:58:29.088
Go on.

1022
00:58:29.288 --> 00:58:31.288
I almost forgot to tell you something.

1023
00:58:31.458 --> 00:58:33.688
Can you come by one day?

1024
00:58:33.688 --> 00:58:35.358
Talk to Mom.

1025
00:58:35.858 --> 00:58:38.298
Why? Is she sick?

1026
00:58:38.298 --> 00:58:39.998
No, she isn't sick,

1027
00:58:40.358 --> 00:58:43.027
but she's been a bit odd since you left.

1028
00:58:43.768 --> 00:58:45.097
What do you mean?

1029
00:58:45.298 --> 00:58:47.608
She leaves home a lot...

1030
00:58:47.608 --> 00:58:49.367
and cries by herself from time to time.

1031
00:58:51.438 --> 00:58:54.108
Mom cries by herself?

1032
00:58:54.648 --> 00:58:57.777
Yes. I think it's because she misses you.

1033
00:58:58.677 --> 00:59:02.487
I even found her crying with my photo.

1034
00:59:04.217 --> 00:59:06.088
She cried over your photo?

1035
00:59:07.487 --> 00:59:09.057
Which one?

1036
00:59:09.628 --> 00:59:11.427
(Off for lunch)

1037
00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:19.351
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1038
00:59:22.838 --> 00:59:24.407
Why bring sandwiches?

1039
00:59:24.878 --> 00:59:27.177
You could've just asked me to treat you.

1040
00:59:27.378 --> 00:59:28.978
I brought them back from our memories.

1041
00:59:29.878 --> 00:59:33.117
After buying me shoes when I got into university,

1042
00:59:33.447 --> 00:59:35.117
you bought me these sandwiches.

1043
00:59:35.648 --> 00:59:36.748
Did I?

1044
00:59:37.418 --> 00:59:39.117
The weather's nice too.

1045
00:59:41.858 --> 00:59:43.387
Is something wrong?

1046
00:59:43.998 --> 00:59:45.427
Why didn't you call ahead?

1047
00:59:47.768 --> 00:59:50.197
I couldn't remember your number.

1048
00:59:51.197 --> 00:59:54.168
I told Mom to give you and Ji Ho my number,

1049
00:59:54.737 --> 00:59:56.507
but nobody called me.

1050
00:59:57.777 --> 00:59:59.478
Mom didn't say anything.

1051
01:00:01.108 --> 01:00:03.777
She didn't tell you?

1052
01:00:04.577 --> 01:00:05.777
I understand.

1053
01:00:06.418 --> 01:00:09.818
You need to leave your past to settle in.

1054
01:00:10.617 --> 01:00:11.788
But...

1055
01:00:12.757 --> 01:00:14.557
why didn't you know?

1056
01:00:14.788 --> 01:00:16.458
You were eight years old.

1057
01:00:16.757 --> 01:00:19.228
Even if Mom was with her family for months,

1058
01:00:19.697 --> 01:00:22.898
one of your sisters' face had changed.

1059
01:00:23.228 --> 01:00:24.568
Why didn't you realize that?

1060
01:00:25.268 --> 01:00:26.467
First of all,

1061
01:00:27.137 --> 01:00:29.407
I didn't know Ji An had died.

1062
01:00:30.608 --> 01:00:32.978
I came home one day, and Mom wasn't home.

1063
01:00:33.407 --> 01:00:36.807
Dad said Mom was sick and with her parents.

1064
01:00:37.648 --> 01:00:40.217
I cried for her for months...

1065
01:00:40.617 --> 01:00:42.188
while living with Dad.

1066
01:00:43.548 --> 01:00:45.188
What about when we left for Dubai?

1067
01:00:46.088 --> 01:00:48.157
Why didn't you notice the change then?

1068
01:00:49.327 --> 01:00:50.927
Right before we left,

1069
01:00:51.628 --> 01:00:53.898
Mom came back with both of you.

1070
01:00:55.197 --> 01:00:57.237
I thought Ji Soo looked different.

1071
01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:01.137
- Ji Soo? - I think I said...

1072
01:01:01.137 --> 01:01:02.938
that she looked different for that reason.

1073
01:01:07.807 --> 01:01:09.708
No, I guess it was you.

1074
01:01:11.548 --> 01:01:12.878
What then?

1075
01:01:15.318 --> 01:01:16.447
What did they say?

1076
01:01:17.518 --> 01:01:19.557
They said she's still my sister...

1077
01:01:19.557 --> 01:01:21.157
and that she had just grown a bit.

1078
01:01:22.427 --> 01:01:24.958
I'm not even sure if I remember correctly.

1079
01:01:25.697 --> 01:01:27.367
If I look back now,

1080
01:01:27.597 --> 01:01:29.597
I didn't even know my sister was dead.

1081
01:01:30.068 --> 01:01:31.737
What was there to doubt?

1082
01:01:32.998 --> 01:01:34.907
And moving to the Middle-east...

1083
01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:37.168
where people wear turbans.

1084
01:01:37.168 --> 01:01:39.838
Having to move to such a strange country...

1085
01:01:39.838 --> 01:01:40.847
made me so stressed out.

1086
01:01:41.807 --> 01:01:43.048
I was so scared.

1087
01:01:43.277 --> 01:01:45.418
I do remember being very timid.

1088
01:01:46.518 --> 01:01:49.048
Oh. Right.

1089
01:01:49.818 --> 01:01:51.157
I guess so.

1090
01:01:51.487 --> 01:01:53.188
Well, how are you?

1091
01:01:54.387 --> 01:01:57.298
You look like you got an upgrade.

1092
01:02:09.407 --> 01:02:10.807
(Haesung's missing daughter)

1093
01:02:13.608 --> 01:02:16.507
It was me, but I'd never seen the photo before.

1094
01:02:16.577 --> 01:02:19.217
I was in dirty clothes and had blotchy skin.

1095
01:02:20.717 --> 01:02:23.018
Mom came back with both of you.

1096
01:02:23.447 --> 01:02:25.518
I thought Ji Soo looked different.

1097
01:02:28.427 --> 01:02:30.827
How would a one-year-old's bones bare that?

1098
01:02:31.327 --> 01:02:32.628
(Haesung's missing daughter)

1099
01:02:35.197 --> 01:02:36.668
(Haesung's missing daughter)

1100
01:02:39.398 --> 01:02:40.867
(Haesung's missing daughter)

1101
01:02:57.358 --> 01:03:00.088
If you go there, you can study abroad.

1102
01:03:00.188 --> 01:03:02.257
Ask them to send you abroad.

1103
01:03:02.257 --> 01:03:05.257
No, you have to do it. It's my wish.

1104
01:03:05.557 --> 01:03:07.367
That's why I'm letting you go.

1105
01:03:07.768 --> 01:03:09.597
So you can dream again.

1106
01:03:09.597 --> 01:03:11.168
Dad's in Seoul now.

1107
01:03:11.168 --> 01:03:13.398
Seeing him will do you no good.

1108
01:05:33.507 --> 01:05:38.277
(Haesung's missing daughter)

1109
01:05:46.257 --> 01:05:48.728
Dad collapsed while following you.

1110
01:05:51.027 --> 01:05:53.027
Your decision...

1111
01:05:53.697 --> 01:05:55.327
Your decision is what matters.

1112
01:05:56.298 --> 01:05:58.338
I wanted to know why you made that decision.

1113
01:05:58.338 --> 01:06:01.538
You don't want to go, right?

1114
01:06:01.538 --> 01:06:03.007
You want to go?

1115
01:06:03.407 --> 01:06:05.637
I know you suffered,

1116
01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:09.208
but do you really want to leave so easily like this?

1117
01:06:28.967 --> 01:06:30.068
So you are...

1118
01:06:31.898 --> 01:06:34.068
the real Ji Soo.

1119
01:06:35.838 --> 01:06:36.838
My...

1120
01:06:38.478 --> 01:06:40.007
dead sister?

1121
01:06:42.447 --> 01:06:45.478
Ji An, you should not go to their house.
