00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:08.453
I really want to see...

3
00:00:09.453 --> 00:00:11.136
someone like you succeed.

4
00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:15.189
So... show me.

5
00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:18.807
Do that...

6
00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:23.075
and make me happy.

7
00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:26.496
Dan Ah.

8
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:28.837
I love you.

9
00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:34.821
I love you, Kang Soo.

10
00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:02.308
I'll definitely show you...

11
00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:07.537
I promise you that I...

12
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.144
will definitely do it.

13
00:01:30.036 --> 00:01:31.641
Next time.

14
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.277
After you succeed.

<i>[Episode 14]</i>

16
00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.873
Huh?
Who is it?

17
00:02:04.873 --> 00:02:07.296
- It's me!
- Oh... at this hour?

18
00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:09.759
Um, just a moment.

19
00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:20.501
Oh... um...

20
00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:22.570
Huh?

21
00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:27.481
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey!

22
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.896
- Hey!
- Hey!

23
00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:37.221
What is all the ruckus about?

24
00:02:38.113 --> 00:02:39.837
I'm sorry, Ms. Dan Ah.

25
00:02:39.837 --> 00:02:41.417
We made you see something that
you shouldn't have seen.

26
00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:43.545
I'm sorry, ma'am.

27
00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:45.717
Things will probably be a bit
tough for you for a while.

28
00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:48.762
But still, aren't I the best
among us three?

29
00:02:48.762 --> 00:02:50.367
I didn't look, so I don't know.

30
00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:52.214
Huh?
I don't think so.

31
00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:54.254
You did a quick once-over
of all of us.

32
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.649
Ow!

33
00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:59.101
What brings you here
in the middle of the night?

34
00:02:59.101 --> 00:03:01.386
Let's put Restaurant Row
back in business.

35
00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:03.362
How, when the restaurant owners are
all saying that they're closing?

36
00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:04.531
I'll take care of that part.

37
00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:07.802
All of you, call the owners of the
restaurants as soon as the sun comes up.

38
00:03:07.802 --> 00:03:10.149
Tell them to open their stores,
and to wait for us.

39
00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:14.017
And Min Chan, let's go together
to your hometown.

40
00:03:14.017 --> 00:03:15.499
To my hometown?

41
00:03:15.836 --> 00:03:18.720
Jeez, I told them to give it up already.

42
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.962
So why are they asking us
to get together again?

43
00:03:20.962 --> 00:03:23.723
Kang Soo and his friends
sure are stubborn.

44
00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:27.798
To be honest, I'd be happy if
Kang Soo found a solution for us again.

45
00:03:27.798 --> 00:03:30.486
To leave a place where I've
run my business for 20 years

46
00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:32.918
makes me feel uneasy.

47
00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:34.510
Jeez.

48
00:03:36.618 --> 00:03:38.618
All right, everyone.
Please come outside.

49
00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:39.803
Kang Soo is coming.

50
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.126
Oh, really?

51
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.928
Let's go.

52
00:03:48.368 --> 00:03:49.386
What are those trucks?

53
00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:51.584
And there's two of them!

54
00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:55.410
<i>[Let us meet at
Hwasung Local Food Store!]</i>

55
00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:09.164
These are fresh ingredients
from the mountains.

56
00:04:09.164 --> 00:04:10.464
You can pay for the ingredients later.

57
00:04:10.464 --> 00:04:12.474
But for now, open your
businesses and use these.

58
00:04:12.474 --> 00:04:15.567
But in exchange, you have to charge
the same price that Jung Family does.

59
00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:16.590
The same price?

60
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.153
If we do that, we can't even make
1000 won per dish!

61
00:04:19.153 --> 00:04:20.477
Just do it like this for now.

62
00:04:20.477 --> 00:04:23.804
If you just get a lot of customers,
your profits will increase either way.

63
00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:25.405
But even so, that won't be easy.

64
00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:27.831
Jung Family doesn't have to
worry about rent, after all.

65
00:04:27.831 --> 00:04:29.648
But we do!

66
00:04:29.648 --> 00:04:32.307
I'm sure there's a way to
solve that problem, too.

67
00:04:32.307 --> 00:04:34.268
The building owners
will be here soon.

68
00:04:34.268 --> 00:04:35.461
Discuss it with them.

69
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:40.254
Please don't collect rent this month.

70
00:04:40.254 --> 00:04:43.434
- What is this ridiculousness?
- What is she saying?

71
00:04:43.434 --> 00:04:46.247
How are we supposed to get by, then?

72
00:04:46.247 --> 00:04:48.787
You can go one month
without the rent.

73
00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:50.386
So please, do that.

74
00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:54.107
There's not a single person who was
interested in viewing your property.

75
00:04:54.107 --> 00:04:58.153
At this rate, when your contracts with
the preexisting restaurants are up

76
00:04:58.153 --> 00:04:59.679
what will you do then?

77
00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:01.759
You'll take on debt to give them
their security deposit back

78
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.302
and your building will be empty.

79
00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:05.165
So don't you have more to lose,
if that happens?

80
00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:06.922
Think about this carefully.

81
00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:08.410
But still!

82
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.633
To be frank, we're all in the same boat.

83
00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:13.126
We will all do well,
or we will all fail.

84
00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:14.523
There are only those two options.

85
00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:17.982
So all of you must be on board with us.

86
00:05:17.982 --> 00:05:19.641
What will you do?

87
00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:22.057
So, are you going to give us
the rent next month, then?

88
00:05:22.057 --> 00:05:23.364
If business booms, yes.

89
00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:25.504
- What?
- Why, I never!

90
00:05:25.504 --> 00:05:26.973
Ugh, just look at how rude she is.

91
00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:30.598
Exactly.
The CEO seems to be a nice person

92
00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:34.088
but your employee
really is something else.

93
00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:41.160
And when we start advertising Restaurant
Row, I want you all to take part.

94
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.475
- What?
- What?

95
00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.311
We're not only advertising
these restaurants.

96
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:45.920
We're advertising your buildings.

97
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.273
So please come out, everyone.

98
00:05:47.273 --> 00:05:51.306
Nice? As if!
He's exactly the same!

99
00:05:51.306 --> 00:05:53.175
It's only natural for
a couple to be similar.

100
00:05:56.636 --> 00:05:59.388
We'll be seeing you
all again later, then!

101
00:06:01.907 --> 00:06:03.489
Oh.

102
00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:06.511
As for the owners of the restaurants

103
00:06:06.511 --> 00:06:08.860
please take these back
and put them up.

104
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.126
Yes, let's do it.

105
00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:12.376
Ah, yes, Mr. Choi.

106
00:06:13.723 --> 00:06:15.201
Here you are.

107
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.696
Please put it up in a
very conspicuous spot!

108
00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:21.083
What's going on with our sales numbers?

109
00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:23.006
It looks like they've dropped
20 percent since yesterday.

110
00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:26.980
There was a sudden increase of customers
who've started going to Restaurant Row.

111
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.158
But, why?

112
00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:30.230
I'm... not too sure, either.

113
00:06:32.944 --> 00:06:36.407
Restaurant Row is reopened!
Welcome!

114
00:06:36.407 --> 00:06:38.489
Welcome!

115
00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:40.138
The prices are quite fair!
Welcome!

116
00:06:40.138 --> 00:06:41.568
- The food is delicious!
- Come on by!

117
00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.391
- Wow, it looks like a lot!
- Strongest Deliveryman! Here we go!

118
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:47.497
Thank you!
Please come by!

119
00:06:50.636 --> 00:06:56.136
<i>[Nice prices, nice restaurants:
"Restaurant Row"]</i>

120
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.444
What brings you here?

121
00:06:59.444 --> 00:07:00.466
You sure are trying hard.

122
00:07:00.466 --> 00:07:02.251
I just heeded your advice, is all.

123
00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:04.973
We have to make proper food first.

124
00:07:04.973 --> 00:07:05.975
That's great.

125
00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:08.943
But you won't be able to
last for long like this.

126
00:07:08.943 --> 00:07:11.025
These people live day-to-day
on the money they make.

127
00:07:11.025 --> 00:07:12.463
So how long could they possibly last?

128
00:07:12.463 --> 00:07:14.812
It's because they live day-to-day
on the money they make

129
00:07:14.812 --> 00:07:16.206
that they will be able to last.

130
00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:18.744
Because it will truly be the end for them
if they're kicked out of here.

131
00:07:20.247 --> 00:07:22.821
Fine.
Try your best.

132
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:25.009
I'll work hard.
Goodbye, then.

133
00:07:35.936 --> 00:07:37.073
Let's see, here.

134
00:07:44.836 --> 00:07:46.908
Ow, that's hot!
Ow!

135
00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:53.799
I'm a slave.
A slave!

136
00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:56.549
Oh, I'm late.
I'm late.

137
00:08:10.634 --> 00:08:11.838
Mmm!

138
00:08:11.838 --> 00:08:13.150
Wow, that's delicious!

139
00:08:14.888 --> 00:08:16.189
Water.

140
00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:28.136
That's nice. I picked
myself a great wife.

141
00:08:28.136 --> 00:08:29.557
Whoa, what?
"Wife?"

142
00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:34.647
Yes, Husband.

143
00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.604
Eat a lot, get pumped up,
and make tons of money.

144
00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:39.326
All right, Wife.

145
00:08:39.326 --> 00:08:40.412
Jeez.

146
00:08:40.412 --> 00:08:44.095
But, it's about time for you
to find a job, too.

147
00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:47.157
No thanks. There isn't a company
that'd hire a guy like me anyway.

148
00:08:47.157 --> 00:08:48.316
What do you mean?

149
00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:50.681
There are places that would even
hire people like you, if you just look.

150
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:51.725
Was that supposed to be a compliment?

151
00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:53.019
I'm telling you to be brave.

152
00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:54.252
Thanks for the food.

153
00:08:54.252 --> 00:08:57.736
Make dinner, and come out
to meet me when I get off work.

154
00:08:57.736 --> 00:08:59.366
See you later!

155
00:09:00.135 --> 00:09:01.678
Ugh, fine.

156
00:09:01.678 --> 00:09:04.326
It does feel good to feed her, though.

157
00:09:06.465 --> 00:09:11.345
Let's go and make dinner now.

158
00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:13.621
Wow.
All right!

159
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:15.298
We're all done now,
ma'am!

160
00:09:15.298 --> 00:09:17.933
Yes, that is all.
Thank you!

161
00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:19.464
Goodbye!

162
00:09:19.464 --> 00:09:21.601
All right, customer number 534!

163
00:09:26.346 --> 00:09:28.581
Oh my, CEO Choi!

164
00:09:29.454 --> 00:09:30.504
Hello.

165
00:09:30.504 --> 00:09:33.714
These two are owners of two
restaurants that we're affiliated with.

166
00:09:33.714 --> 00:09:35.558
Oh!

167
00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:38.230
I heard all about the hardships
you faced.

168
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.005
I'll help you out.

169
00:09:40.005 --> 00:09:42.393
You get your loans from who?
Na Han Tae... wait, no.

170
00:09:42.393 --> 00:09:43.846
I mean, from me,
Valued Customers. Yes.

171
00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:47.835
This is the proposal
we discussed earlier.

172
00:09:47.835 --> 00:09:49.273
Oh, yes.
I see.

173
00:09:49.273 --> 00:09:52.095
Are you really going to give us a loan?

174
00:09:52.095 --> 00:09:55.850
You know all about how our businesses
aren't doing well right now.

175
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.135
Don't you worry.

176
00:09:57.135 --> 00:09:59.701
I'll give you the best rates
for small businesses that we have

177
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:01.668
and get you more than enough!

178
00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:02.898
Well? How about it?

179
00:10:05.728 --> 00:10:06.935
Thank you!

180
00:10:06.935 --> 00:10:09.481
But... aren't you stretching
yourself a bit too thin?

181
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:11.465
Oh, what are you talking about?

182
00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:14.346
You get your loans from who?
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

183
00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:15.817
From Na Han Tae!

184
00:10:15.817 --> 00:10:17.104
Give me just one moment.

185
00:10:18.435 --> 00:10:20.776
All right, let's take a look.

186
00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:26.086
Are you confident in them?

187
00:10:26.086 --> 00:10:27.263
Yes.

188
00:10:27.971 --> 00:10:31.118
The person pushing for the loan
is named Choi Kang Soo.

189
00:10:31.118 --> 00:10:33.592
He's the CEO of a company
called "Strongest Deliveryman."

190
00:10:33.893 --> 00:10:35.752
So?
What did he do?

191
00:10:36.648 --> 00:10:38.630
- He's a really good person.
- What?

192
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.071
He's ridiculously nice.

193
00:10:40.071 --> 00:10:41.579
That's why he will succeed.

194
00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:43.847
<i>How is this possible?</i>

195
00:10:43.847 --> 00:10:46.004
They got a loan from a different bank

196
00:10:46.004 --> 00:10:48.620
and they even got permission
to not pay rent for a month.

197
00:10:49.253 --> 00:10:53.235
I think that they're using our
management strategy.

198
00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:56.427
"All we need to do is last a couple
of months, even if we incur losses."

199
00:10:56.427 --> 00:10:58.388
I believe that this is their approach.

200
00:10:58.388 --> 00:11:01.917
And all of that was thought up
by that man, Choi Kang Soo?

201
00:11:01.917 --> 00:11:03.768
It does seem that way, for now.

202
00:11:03.768 --> 00:11:07.959
But there's a possibility that someone
tipped him off about our strategy, too.

203
00:11:09.514 --> 00:11:11.087
What do you mean, tipped him off?

204
00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:15.278
I'm only saying this because I feel like
his strategy is too similar to ours.

205
00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:18.457
Look into all of the people working
at Strongest Deliveryman.

206
00:11:18.457 --> 00:11:20.139
Find out what relationship they have
with Choi Kang Soo

207
00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:23.258
what their roles are, and what their
weaknesses are. Everything.

208
00:11:23.258 --> 00:11:24.731
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:11:30.664 --> 00:11:32.638
Looks like the impossible became
possible all because

210
00:11:32.638 --> 00:11:34.119
that psycho Kang Soo
put some legwork into this.

211
00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:36.884
Please choose your words more carefully
during our meetings.

212
00:11:36.884 --> 00:11:38.572
This is a compliment.

213
00:11:40.036 --> 00:11:41.796
I didn't do this alone.

214
00:11:41.796 --> 00:11:43.417
We all did it together.

215
00:11:43.417 --> 00:11:45.556
But you really did something amazing
this time around, Kang Soo.

216
00:11:45.556 --> 00:11:47.940
And you did too, Ms. Dan Ah.

217
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.701
You were really great at
helping your man.

218
00:11:50.135 --> 00:11:54.230
I think it's crucial for a man to meet a
good woman in order to succeed.

219
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.105
If you keep acting like that, Ms. Dan Ah
will teach you another lesson.

220
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:01.983
Yes, I'll be the one to take care of
the CEO from now on.

221
00:12:01.983 --> 00:12:05.036
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

222
00:12:05.036 --> 00:12:06.634
So, um, that's why I wanted to ask...

223
00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:10.158
what did you two do back then,
by the beach?

224
00:12:10.158 --> 00:12:13.467
It looked like there was a lot of sand
on Kang Soo's back.

225
00:12:14.036 --> 00:12:15.250
- Ow!
- Jeez.

226
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.233
This is why you need to quit
while you're ahead.

227
00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:18.985
We're all going to
get hit, at this rate.

228
00:12:18.985 --> 00:12:20.682
Watch your backs, all of you.

229
00:12:20.682 --> 00:12:23.231
Starting from today, I'll be the
Chief of Discipline, too.

230
00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:27.068
At any rate, I'm glad that
you've all cheered up.

231
00:12:27.704 --> 00:12:29.063
So that's why I want to
tell you now

232
00:12:29.063 --> 00:12:31.339
that it'll be really tough,
starting from tomorrow.

233
00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:33.692
I guess it really will be tough,
seeing as how you're saying it.

234
00:12:33.692 --> 00:12:37.850
So eat a big breakfast and meet up
at Restaurant Row by 9 a.m.

235
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.845
Can't you give us a hint about
what to expect, CEO Choi?

236
00:12:42.571 --> 00:12:45.558
Come and see for yourself
tomorrow, Section Chief Jung.

237
00:12:45.558 --> 00:12:46.807
Yes, Chairwoman Lee.

238
00:12:49.903 --> 00:12:51.259
Who is it?

239
00:12:54.994 --> 00:12:56.441
Hello!

240
00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:58.046
- Sister-in-Law!
- Sister-in-Law!

241
00:12:58.951 --> 00:13:01.076
Um... I mean...
Younger Sister-in-Law.

242
00:13:01.076 --> 00:13:02.904
You mean Ex-Sister-in-Law!

243
00:13:02.904 --> 00:13:03.965
Stop it.

244
00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:05.610
She's pitiful enough as it is.

245
00:13:06.135 --> 00:13:09.111
Oh, welcome!
What brings you here?

246
00:13:09.111 --> 00:13:11.606
Are you looking for more
employees, by any chance?

247
00:13:11.606 --> 00:13:13.624
- Employees?
- He's not a newbie.

248
00:13:13.624 --> 00:13:15.861
- He has some experience.
- Who are you talking about?

249
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.711
You don't mean...

250
00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:19.279
Yes.

251
00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:22.589
Couldn't Mr. Jin Kyu work here?

252
00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.418
You mean Oh Jin Kyu?

253
00:13:24.418 --> 00:13:26.781
Why are you recommending him,
Ms. Ji Yoon?

254
00:13:26.781 --> 00:13:28.499
Oh, it's just because...

255
00:13:29.758 --> 00:13:33.017
To be honest,
I'm his guardian.

256
00:13:33.936 --> 00:13:35.177
What?

257
00:13:35.177 --> 00:13:36.358
He'll definitely be useful.

258
00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:39.068
He has experience making deliveries
and managing a restaurant.

259
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.145
And, um...

260
00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:43.336
he's good at making rice
and side dishes.

261
00:13:43.336 --> 00:13:44.624
What are you...

262
00:13:44.624 --> 00:13:46.758
Fine. Leave his resume and go.

263
00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:48.311
I actually wanted to scout him.

264
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:49.605
- Really?
- Yeah.

265
00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:51.057
Thank you, Mister!

266
00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:55.374
No, I mean, CEO.

267
00:13:55.904 --> 00:13:57.417
Work hard, then, everyone!

268
00:14:02.672 --> 00:14:04.148
Are you really going
to hire Oh Jin Kyu?

269
00:14:04.148 --> 00:14:05.249
Yeah.

270
00:14:05.249 --> 00:14:06.442
Hey, that's going too far!

271
00:14:06.442 --> 00:14:08.361
Don't worry.
I'm not just being nosy.

272
00:14:08.361 --> 00:14:09.805
I was planning to scout him anyway.

273
00:14:10.387 --> 00:14:14.288
Everything we did today was
Oh Jin Kyu's idea.

274
00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:17.981
If it hadn't been for him, I never
would've thought about hanging in there.

275
00:14:24.609 --> 00:14:26.318
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

276
00:14:26.318 --> 00:14:28.547
It's a security device.

277
00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:30.552
We should maintain our boundaries.

278
00:14:30.552 --> 00:14:31.611
All right!

279
00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:33.480
Have fun with your little
DMZ you've set up.

280
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.417
- Fine.
- What do you take me for?

281
00:14:39.135 --> 00:14:40.943
Good night.

282
00:14:59.459 --> 00:15:00.555
Comrade.

283
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.643
- What?
- I've defected from the North.

284
00:15:03.643 --> 00:15:05.134
Open the door.

285
00:15:06.936 --> 00:15:08.447
Stop it.

286
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.716
What now?

287
00:15:19.716 --> 00:15:22.145
Hey, kids, open up!

288
00:15:22.145 --> 00:15:24.643
I'm not a tiger!
I'm really your mom!

289
00:15:24.643 --> 00:15:27.196
See?
It's your mom's hand!

290
00:15:27.196 --> 00:15:28.975
Excuse me, I think you've
got the wrong house.

291
00:15:28.975 --> 00:15:31.776
Get your hand out of here!
Get out! Go!

292
00:15:31.776 --> 00:15:33.191
Fine!

293
00:15:33.191 --> 00:15:34.363
I'm going to sleep.

294
00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:46.480
What now...

295
00:15:51.586 --> 00:15:53.129
Stop it!

296
00:15:55.485 --> 00:15:56.738
Damn it!

297
00:16:00.624 --> 00:16:02.880
<i>Ji Yoon.
It's me, Dad.</i>

298
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.071
Just a moment!

299
00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:21.585
I'm coming!

300
00:16:26.764 --> 00:16:28.888
Why are you laughing
so loudly by yourself?

301
00:16:30.345 --> 00:16:31.426
You're still not sleeping?

302
00:16:31.426 --> 00:16:32.816
I'm about to.

303
00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:36.552
Here, Dad.
Sit here.

304
00:16:36.552 --> 00:16:37.691
<i>All right.</i>

305
00:16:41.619 --> 00:16:43.509
So, what brings you here?

306
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:45.940
I heard you moved, so I was curious
and wanted to come by.

307
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.148
How did you know that I moved?

308
00:16:48.696 --> 00:16:51.504
Are you keeping tabs on me?

309
00:16:52.836 --> 00:16:54.214
Um, I...

310
00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:56.110
well, um...

311
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.167
Dad.

312
00:16:57.167 --> 00:16:59.129
I don't do it anymore, though.

313
00:16:59.129 --> 00:17:01.259
I got a report saying that you

314
00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:05.893
broke up with Choi Kang Soo and that
you ended things with Oh Jin Kyu, too.

315
00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:07.046
<i>Ugh, jeez.</i>

316
00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:09.591
Do you really hate me
dating that much?

317
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:14.252
I just want you to stay
my daughter forever.

318
00:17:14.252 --> 00:17:17.085
You're not being a doting dad.
You're just being plain dumb.

319
00:17:17.085 --> 00:17:18.940
I still don't care!

320
00:17:21.603 --> 00:17:24.497
Why did you split up your
room like this, though?

321
00:17:25.554 --> 00:17:26.875
Are you, by any chance...

322
00:17:29.036 --> 00:17:31.187
living with some other man?

323
00:17:36.836 --> 00:17:37.957
Yeah!

324
00:17:37.957 --> 00:17:39.274
With him.

325
00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:43.661
This is his room.

326
00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:46.419
It turns out that this guy is male.

327
00:17:46.419 --> 00:17:48.172
Oh, you punk.

328
00:17:49.454 --> 00:17:50.949
You're still a kid, huh?

329
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.556
All right.
Just stay that way forever.

330
00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:55.814
Yes, Dad.

331
00:17:56.497 --> 00:18:00.218
Oh yeah. I need to use your bathroom.

332
00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:02.018
It's over here, right?

333
00:18:02.018 --> 00:18:04.005
<i>No! No!
No!</i>

334
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.931
I... um... left my underwear
in there to soak.

335
00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:12.293
It's embarassing to have
you see it, Dad.

336
00:18:12.293 --> 00:18:14.259
It's fine.
I'm your dad.

337
00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:16.880
No! You're still a man, Dad!

338
00:18:17.804 --> 00:18:19.843
But I really have to go!

339
00:18:19.843 --> 00:18:21.470
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.613
<i>There's a bathroom at the
playground out front.</i>

341
00:18:23.613 --> 00:18:25.288
Let's go there together.
I'll show you where it is.

342
00:18:25.288 --> 00:18:27.999
No, it's fine.
It's cold outside.

343
00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:29.807
I'll find it myself.

344
00:18:34.174 --> 00:18:35.364
Here, take this.

345
00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:36.809
Buy what you need with this.

346
00:18:36.809 --> 00:18:37.980
No, I can't!

347
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.586
If I do that, I won't be
fully independent!

348
00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:41.178
I can't even give you allowance?

349
00:18:41.178 --> 00:18:43.855
Give me only 50,000 won, then.

350
00:18:43.855 --> 00:18:45.085
Oh, you little rascal.

351
00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:47.855
Here.

352
00:18:48.367 --> 00:18:49.836
Thank you.

353
00:18:50.514 --> 00:18:52.047
Have a safe trip home.

354
00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:55.124
Oh, you kind, pretty little thing.

355
00:18:55.124 --> 00:18:56.490
Good night.

356
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.050
I'll go now.
I really need to go.

357
00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.347
Don't see me out!

358
00:19:01.836 --> 00:19:03.501
Bye, Dad!

359
00:19:08.406 --> 00:19:09.480
Is he gone?

360
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.524
Yes.

361
00:19:15.414 --> 00:19:16.670
What?

362
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.469
Just because.

363
00:19:20.872 --> 00:19:22.364
I just feel really bad now.

364
00:19:22.364 --> 00:19:25.056
It's okay. You can just
make me super happy, then.

365
00:19:25.056 --> 00:19:26.872
- What?
- Hurry up and go to bed.

366
00:19:26.872 --> 00:19:27.932
Good night!

367
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:39.822
You worked hard today.

368
00:19:39.822 --> 00:19:42.344
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

369
00:19:42.344 --> 00:19:43.586
We're done!

370
00:19:45.362 --> 00:19:46.928
Whoo!

371
00:19:51.922 --> 00:19:53.010
Aren't you leaving?

372
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.776
Um, yeah.
In a bit.

373
00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:56.480
Have a good night together, then.

374
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.823
Oh, come on!

375
00:19:59.134 --> 00:20:01.698
How am I supposed to discipline him?

376
00:20:01.698 --> 00:20:03.246
It'll be hard to discipline him.

377
00:20:03.246 --> 00:20:06.211
There wasn't a single teacher who could
discipline him in school, either.

378
00:20:06.925 --> 00:20:09.778
Hearing you say that makes me
really want to do it.

379
00:20:11.316 --> 00:20:13.251
Focus only on me.

380
00:20:13.251 --> 00:20:14.711
Oh...

381
00:20:20.517 --> 00:20:21.962
Hey!

382
00:20:21.962 --> 00:20:23.028
Oof!

383
00:20:26.829 --> 00:20:28.903
Make yourself shorter.

384
00:20:31.668 --> 00:20:33.270
Close your eyes.

385
00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:41.758
Ow!

386
00:20:43.845 --> 00:20:46.941
Get back to work.
I'll go make some coffee.

387
00:20:46.941 --> 00:20:48.139
Okay.

388
00:20:59.163 --> 00:21:02.395
<font color="#80ffff">[DramaFever Ver] Episode 14 Strongest Deliveryman</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

389
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:22.854
What are you doing?

390
00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:25.297
Oh... hey!

391
00:21:27.891 --> 00:21:29.470
Why'd you come down?

392
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.441
I smelled something delicious, so...

393
00:21:32.018 --> 00:21:33.841
Way to ruin everything.

394
00:21:33.841 --> 00:21:35.833
I was going to surprise you.

395
00:21:35.833 --> 00:21:38.528
Sorry. I was just worried that you'd
eat everything yourself.

396
00:21:38.528 --> 00:21:40.342
Ugh, seriously?

397
00:21:42.479 --> 00:21:43.797
Try it.

398
00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:52.934
How is it?

399
00:21:52.934 --> 00:21:54.594
I don't know.

400
00:21:54.594 --> 00:21:55.911
Huh?

401
00:21:55.911 --> 00:21:58.582
I have no idea what this taste is.

402
00:21:59.634 --> 00:22:01.374
I'm so happy.

403
00:22:01.874 --> 00:22:05.751
It's the first time I've ever eaten
food that someone else made for me.

404
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.298
It's really good.
Thanks.

405
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:13.405
I'm glad to hear you
say that it's good.

406
00:22:13.405 --> 00:22:15.790
This is the only thing
I know how to make.

407
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.066
Really?

408
00:22:17.066 --> 00:22:18.132
Yeah.

409
00:22:18.664 --> 00:22:20.199
But why onion rings, of all people?

410
00:22:20.199 --> 00:22:22.947
Well, it's kind of a long story.

411
00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:25.846
What is it?
Tell me.

412
00:22:25.846 --> 00:22:27.189
Nah.

413
00:22:29.073 --> 00:22:30.827
Ms. Lee Dan Ah.

414
00:22:32.326 --> 00:22:35.758
It's just something
that I make sometimes.

415
00:22:37.297 --> 00:22:39.191
When I want to get energized.

416
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:40.267
Hmm?

417
00:22:40.267 --> 00:22:42.448
To be honest, I used to be
really good at studying.

418
00:22:42.448 --> 00:22:43.689
I had the highest grades
among the students

419
00:22:43.689 --> 00:22:45.064
accepted to Hanin University
as an English major.

420
00:22:45.707 --> 00:22:47.420
- Really?
- Yeah.

421
00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.133
But I gave it up.

422
00:22:49.133 --> 00:22:52.595
I had to start working right away
to make money, you see.

423
00:22:53.634 --> 00:22:57.699
So I moved to Seoul without planning
anything, on a midnight train.

424
00:22:57.699 --> 00:23:00.278
I cried so much on that train.

425
00:23:01.162 --> 00:23:03.760
I really, really wanted to
go to college, you see.

426
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.163
I... I see.

427
00:23:07.055 --> 00:23:09.864
But then, I cried a whole bunch
a couple months after that.

428
00:23:11.053 --> 00:23:14.968
Because I came to realize
that I had no hope.

429
00:23:14.968 --> 00:23:18.299
And that made me so miserable...

430
00:23:20.095 --> 00:23:22.443
that I flung myself into the river.

431
00:23:22.443 --> 00:23:23.790
What?

432
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.855
But I managed to survive.

433
00:23:25.855 --> 00:23:28.585
The woman who saved me back then

434
00:23:28.585 --> 00:23:30.999
took me to her Chinese restaurant.

435
00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:35.018
But when we got there, her husband
made onion rings, and was eating them.

436
00:23:35.969 --> 00:23:39.925
But when he saw me, a girl
who'd almost drowned

437
00:23:39.925 --> 00:23:43.121
he asked me if I wanted to eat it,
and gave me a plate of onion rings.

438
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:45.452
So I picked up just one,
and ate it.

439
00:23:45.452 --> 00:23:48.318
And I have no idea why,
but it was so delicious!

440
00:23:48.318 --> 00:23:50.871
So I started bawling my eyes out again.

441
00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.775
On that day, I decided
that I'd never try to kill myself again.

442
00:23:59.075 --> 00:24:03.049
That I'd definitely survive, and
escape this country.

443
00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:09.134
And ever since then, if I
ever felt my resolve crumbling

444
00:24:09.134 --> 00:24:11.287
I'd make this and eat it.

445
00:24:12.134 --> 00:24:17.307
And when I did, I always
felt a burst of energy.

446
00:24:33.036 --> 00:24:35.596
Tell me whenever
things are tough for you.

447
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:39.595
I'll make this for you.

448
00:24:42.036 --> 00:24:44.566
It's super nutritious.

449
00:25:16.621 --> 00:25:18.577
Do your best, CEO Kang.

450
00:25:19.036 --> 00:25:21.103
I'll cheer you on.

451
00:25:21.605 --> 00:25:23.828
Yes, Ms. Dan Ah.

452
00:25:24.687 --> 00:25:26.392
I'll do my best.

453
00:25:42.776 --> 00:25:43.940
What's going on?

454
00:25:44.672 --> 00:25:46.709
- I wanted to go with you.
- Do you have a death wish?

455
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.777
Why, you little...
are you ignoring me?

456
00:25:51.777 --> 00:25:54.921
Yeah. I'm supposed to,
at times like these.

457
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:56.528
- What?
- Soon Ae.

458
00:25:56.528 --> 00:25:58.257
You've worked so hard
up until now.

459
00:25:58.257 --> 00:26:00.327
What kind of nonsense are you
spouting, so early in the morning?

460
00:26:00.327 --> 00:26:01.492
I'll ignore that, too.

461
00:26:02.116 --> 00:26:03.230
Let's go.

462
00:26:04.073 --> 00:26:05.634
What's with that guy?

463
00:26:05.634 --> 00:26:07.682
Were you watching K-Dramas
yesterday, or something?

464
00:26:08.903 --> 00:26:11.443
It's not cool at all when you
say things like that!

465
00:26:11.443 --> 00:26:12.893
Don't get it twisted!

466
00:26:18.462 --> 00:26:20.134
What brings you all the way here?

467
00:26:20.134 --> 00:26:23.355
It's only natural for me to come visit,
when you've opened a new building.

468
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.858
What do you think will happen
to this Restaurant Row?

469
00:26:26.858 --> 00:26:29.759
I heard that they're really
putting up a fight.

470
00:26:30.934 --> 00:26:33.767
That won't change the outcome, though.

471
00:26:33.767 --> 00:26:35.765
So don't worry about
such unnecessary things.

472
00:26:35.765 --> 00:26:37.114
Oh, please don't take this the wrong way.

473
00:26:37.114 --> 00:26:39.238
Of course I wouldn't worry
about such a thing.

474
00:26:39.238 --> 00:26:40.501
I just wanted to ask.

475
00:26:40.501 --> 00:26:44.336
First things first: you're not cool
because you have an ugly face.

476
00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:45.861
You're not tall either.

477
00:26:47.095 --> 00:26:48.979
Are his ears plugged or what?

478
00:26:48.979 --> 00:26:50.430
Hey, can't you hear me?

479
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:55.069
I said can't you hear me?

480
00:26:59.579 --> 00:27:00.889
What is it?

481
00:27:01.228 --> 00:27:04.557
Ah, it's nothing. We should head back.

482
00:27:04.557 --> 00:27:06.179
Hey, Kim Jong Hyun.

483
00:27:06.179 --> 00:27:07.537
- Soon Ae.
- Move!

484
00:27:08.547 --> 00:27:11.028
Hey, didn't you hear me?

485
00:27:15.009 --> 00:27:16.564
It's been a long time.

486
00:27:19.903 --> 00:27:21.752
You live in this neighborhood?

487
00:27:21.752 --> 00:27:25.463
Yeah, what are you doing crawling
into this neighborhood?

488
00:27:25.463 --> 00:27:27.565
Who are you latching onto now?

489
00:27:28.085 --> 00:27:31.932
I don't know who you are,
but don't speak so carelessly.

490
00:27:31.932 --> 00:27:33.384
Who am I?

491
00:27:34.691 --> 00:27:38.527
I'm the unlucky woman who was married to
this punk for a brief time. Why?

492
00:27:38.528 --> 00:27:40.550
Why don't we get going?

493
00:27:41.662 --> 00:27:44.569
Hey, I'm warning you!

494
00:27:44.569 --> 00:27:46.403
Don't even think of starting
anything here.

495
00:27:46.403 --> 00:27:49.441
I'll get you with my knife, okay?
I'll kill you.

496
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:50.582
That's enough.

497
00:27:50.582 --> 00:27:54.392
That son of a bitch...
where does he think this is?

498
00:27:58.851 --> 00:28:01.031
Hey, hey! Ji Yoon!

499
00:28:01.631 --> 00:28:03.559
You have to take your phone.

500
00:28:03.562 --> 00:28:06.086
- That isn't mine. It's yours, Jin Kyu.
- What?

501
00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:07.567
Make sure to pick up if it rings.

502
00:28:07.567 --> 00:28:10.587
If they ask you something,
say you'll work hard no matter what.

503
00:28:10.587 --> 00:28:12.140
What are you talking about?

504
00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.492
See you later. Bye.

505
00:28:14.785 --> 00:28:16.716
What has she done now?

506
00:28:20.249 --> 00:28:21.492
Hello, this is Oh Jin Kyu.

507
00:28:21.495 --> 00:28:23.893
<i>Hello, Oh Jin Kyu.
This is Strongest Deliveryman.</i>

508
00:28:23.893 --> 00:28:25.595
<i>Congratulations, you're hired.</i>

509
00:28:25.595 --> 00:28:26.699
Wait. What?

510
00:28:26.699 --> 00:28:28.086
<i>You know where our office is, right?</i>

511
00:28:28.086 --> 00:28:31.410
<i>Please come in now. Leave right away.</i>

512
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.951
Hello?

513
00:28:36.346 --> 00:28:38.892
Ji Yoon, you...

514
00:28:39.989 --> 00:28:41.191
Seriously, that girl.

515
00:28:46.297 --> 00:28:49.459
Where are you going?
We told you to come in right away.

516
00:28:49.459 --> 00:28:50.710
Forget it. Don't joke around.

517
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.249
How can I work with you guys?

518
00:28:52.249 --> 00:28:54.929
Work with us. We need you.

519
00:28:54.929 --> 00:28:58.082
Congratulations. You were the top choice.

520
00:28:58.082 --> 00:28:59.246
Let's go.

521
00:29:04.664 --> 00:29:07.064
Are you really going to do this to me
on the first day?

522
00:29:07.064 --> 00:29:09.172
Ah, you don't like this kind of thing?

523
00:29:09.624 --> 00:29:11.784
You thought I'd like this?

524
00:29:11.784 --> 00:29:13.211
You could try something else.

525
00:29:23.999 --> 00:29:25.495
Come eat on our street.

526
00:29:25.495 --> 00:29:27.634
Come eat lunch on our street.

527
00:29:27.634 --> 00:29:28.952
This is friendly food.

528
00:29:28.952 --> 00:29:33.911
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

529
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:36.278
Garlic is domestic!

530
00:29:36.278 --> 00:29:37.943
Onion is domestic!

531
00:29:39.249 --> 00:29:40.537
Hold on now!

532
00:29:41.049 --> 00:29:42.901
Why are you only throwing it at me?

533
00:29:42.901 --> 00:29:45.220
Can you target him too?

534
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.941
That man is a little scary.

535
00:29:46.941 --> 00:29:48.549
Your face is less burdensome.

536
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:50.989
I'll take that as a compliment.

537
00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:52.218
Friendly prices!

538
00:29:52.858 --> 00:29:54.690
Friendly restaurants!

539
00:29:56.865 --> 00:30:02.021
We need about 35 million won for this
month's wages and insurance.

540
00:30:02.361 --> 00:30:05.260
But, our company's profit is only
10 million won.

541
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.812
We'll use our investment money for the
amount we need.

542
00:30:07.812 --> 00:30:09.108
All right.

543
00:30:10.049 --> 00:30:12.881
Who is our investor anyway?

544
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:15.338
Just someone.
You know I know a lot of people.

545
00:30:15.338 --> 00:30:18.977
Oh yeah, Sunjin Construction has decided
to get rid of their company cafeteria.

546
00:30:18.977 --> 00:30:20.457
- Really?
- Yes.

547
00:30:20.458 --> 00:30:22.057
They don't have room in their building.

548
00:30:22.057 --> 00:30:27.087
So, they're looking for restaurants to
use in place of their cafeteria.

549
00:30:27.087 --> 00:30:31.679
The employees would pay using vouchers
and Sunjin would pay every month.

550
00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:32.999
They announced a call for bids today.

551
00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:34.191
We should tender a bid then.

552
00:30:34.191 --> 00:30:37.828
All the restaurants will bid under the
name Strongest Deliveryman.

553
00:30:37.828 --> 00:30:38.940
Okay.

554
00:30:41.836 --> 00:30:44.098
How many employees does Sunjin
Construction have?

555
00:30:44.098 --> 00:30:47.146
Including the executives,
approximately 1,800 people.

556
00:30:47.146 --> 00:30:49.659
Just one meal of lunch would be over
10 million won.

557
00:30:49.659 --> 00:30:52.594
If you included overtime dinner and
after-work outings...

558
00:30:52.594 --> 00:30:55.989
it could be, at least, 550 million won
a month.

559
00:30:55.989 --> 00:30:58.307
That's almost 6 billion won a year.

560
00:30:59.086 --> 00:31:01.710
Make sure nothing goes wrong with
the application for the bid.

561
00:31:02.057 --> 00:31:03.588
Who will have the power to decide?

562
00:31:03.588 --> 00:31:06.146
All of the employees in the company
will vote next Wednesday.

563
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:09.460
We will have to spend on marketing to
the employees until that time.

564
00:31:15.787 --> 00:31:18.069
We have to win Sunjin Construction.

565
00:31:18.499 --> 00:31:21.900
If we lose that company,
the restaurants here won't survive.

566
00:31:22.396 --> 00:31:24.555
Then our company will suffer too,
of course.

567
00:31:24.556 --> 00:31:26.823
Honestly, from Sunjin's point of view...

568
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.652
Jung Family's building is much
more appealing.

569
00:31:29.652 --> 00:31:33.451
The interior is clean and you can get
everything in one building.

570
00:31:33.452 --> 00:31:34.764
Tasty food comes from the hand.

571
00:31:34.764 --> 00:31:40.095
Also, a store should have spiderwebs,
some dust, and broken dishes.

572
00:31:40.095 --> 00:31:42.045
Those places have the really good food.

573
00:31:42.045 --> 00:31:43.835
Places should still be hygienic.

574
00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:47.864
It's those places that have the best
food and you just don't know.

575
00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:51.585
Just hit him on the back, CEO.

576
00:31:51.585 --> 00:31:53.374
He's so dirty that I won't hit him.

577
00:31:53.374 --> 00:31:54.531
Thank you.

578
00:31:54.785 --> 00:31:56.544
Is this the usual company atmosphere?

579
00:31:56.544 --> 00:31:59.575
Yes, get used to it.
You're a member too.

580
00:32:03.047 --> 00:32:04.605
Let's cheers one more time.

581
00:32:05.755 --> 00:32:08.266
To our newest rookie, Oh Jin Kyu!

582
00:32:08.266 --> 00:32:09.980
Cheers!

583
00:32:15.126 --> 00:32:17.941
Let's drink up quickly and go to
a karaoke room.

584
00:32:18.712 --> 00:32:20.083
Of course, we should go.

585
00:32:20.083 --> 00:32:22.903
The most important part of a company
dinner is karaoke, right?

586
00:32:22.903 --> 00:32:25.605
Sung Jae is really onto something.

587
00:32:25.605 --> 00:32:29.241
Sorry, but I'll just head home.

588
00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:31.682
Hey, now. The rookie can't leave.

589
00:32:33.932 --> 00:32:35.381
Sure, go home.

590
00:32:35.381 --> 00:32:36.594
Wait, now.

591
00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.318
Let him off this one time.
It's his first day, Director.

592
00:32:40.318 --> 00:32:43.288
I'm telling you as the director.
You will not get off next time.

593
00:32:43.288 --> 00:32:44.809
- Keep that in mind.
- Yes.

594
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:47.031
- Director.
- Good boy.

595
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:49.663
Good boy!

596
00:32:49.663 --> 00:32:51.193
Good boy!

597
00:32:56.403 --> 00:32:58.043
Oh, why are you out here?

598
00:32:58.043 --> 00:32:59.294
Jin Kyu!

599
00:33:00.606 --> 00:33:02.687
How was it? What did you do today?

600
00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:06.143
I was just wearing a fur mask all day.

601
00:33:06.143 --> 00:33:08.593
Why did you get me a job just anywhere
without asking me?

602
00:33:08.593 --> 00:33:11.131
Because there's nowhere else you can
work, Jin Kyu.

603
00:33:11.832 --> 00:33:15.182
Are the people making you uncomfortable?
Did they make you an outcast?

604
00:33:15.182 --> 00:33:16.682
Dan Ah said something, didn't she?

605
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.499
Seriously? Where is she right now?

606
00:33:20.053 --> 00:33:22.123
No, she didn't. What's with you?

607
00:33:22.785 --> 00:33:24.201
Everyone's good to me.

608
00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:25.384
Really?

609
00:33:25.881 --> 00:33:27.073
Yes.

610
00:33:28.073 --> 00:33:30.543
Then, what's the problem?

611
00:33:31.043 --> 00:33:33.461
I just feel a little awkward.

612
00:33:33.749 --> 00:33:38.086
They're all people I feel a little
awkward around.

613
00:33:38.855 --> 00:33:40.306
I was worried over nothing.

614
00:33:40.924 --> 00:33:42.716
Oh, you're so cute.

615
00:33:43.316 --> 00:33:45.437
Let's go inside. I made delicious food.

616
00:34:03.372 --> 00:34:04.632
Forget about it.

617
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:06.452
Pretend you didn't see him.

618
00:34:06.452 --> 00:34:08.631
I saw him so how can I pretend I
didn't meet him?

619
00:34:09.484 --> 00:34:11.200
Should I take out my brain and rinse it?

620
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.341
You said we should forget.

621
00:34:13.332 --> 00:34:16.261
- So, forget.
- I'm just so angry.

622
00:34:31.812 --> 00:34:34.817
You idiot! It's all your fault.

623
00:34:34.817 --> 00:34:38.836
If you had listened to me back then,
this wouldn't have happened to us.

624
00:34:42.232 --> 00:34:43.303
Go.

625
00:34:44.073 --> 00:34:45.805
I can't stand seeing you even more.

626
00:34:49.111 --> 00:34:50.131
All right.

627
00:34:51.582 --> 00:34:52.834
Sleep well.

628
00:34:58.495 --> 00:35:00.716
Don't even think of causing
trouble again!

629
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.372
I'll be fine after crying a bit.

630
00:35:08.567 --> 00:35:10.941
Don't worry and just sleep.

631
00:35:24.504 --> 00:35:27.006
Why are we leaving already?
My throat was just loosening up.

632
00:35:27.006 --> 00:35:29.404
We can't stay anymore because of
Sung Jae.

633
00:35:29.404 --> 00:35:31.133
Why did you want to come here?

634
00:35:31.133 --> 00:35:33.243
People in other rooms would think
there was a fight.

635
00:35:33.243 --> 00:35:34.267
You punks...

636
00:35:34.292 --> 00:35:36.727
You guys should try to understand.
He's improved a lot.

637
00:35:36.727 --> 00:35:37.765
Hey.

638
00:35:37.937 --> 00:35:40.562
Let's get going.
We need to work again tomorrow.

639
00:35:40.562 --> 00:35:43.392
Wow, you are very strict with us.

640
00:35:43.392 --> 00:35:45.671
- She's the CEO.
- Let's get going.

641
00:35:48.062 --> 00:35:49.457
Oh, you girls are here?

642
00:35:49.457 --> 00:35:51.317
- Yes.
- One moment.

643
00:35:52.218 --> 00:35:55.299
Hmm... girls, room 103.

644
00:35:55.299 --> 00:35:56.557
Okay.

645
00:36:04.057 --> 00:36:05.950
What are you doing right now?

646
00:36:06.288 --> 00:36:08.359
Let go. I'm working.

647
00:36:10.819 --> 00:36:11.895
Hey.

648
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.942
- Move.
- Later.

649
00:36:14.942 --> 00:36:17.100
You can't solve anything by dragging
her out now.

650
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.229
Move! I can't leave her here.

651
00:36:19.229 --> 00:36:20.276
Dan Ah.

652
00:36:23.803 --> 00:36:26.689
Hey! Let go of me!

653
00:36:27.256 --> 00:36:28.977
Let go of me!

654
00:36:29.705 --> 00:36:30.845
Hey!

655
00:36:33.214 --> 00:36:34.586
I'll check on them.

656
00:36:35.256 --> 00:36:36.656
You guys should head home.

657
00:36:38.633 --> 00:36:41.683
Yeah, I'm a karaoke bar worker.

658
00:36:41.683 --> 00:36:44.096
What about it? So, what?

659
00:36:44.096 --> 00:36:45.915
You really want to die?

660
00:36:46.196 --> 00:36:47.511
What do you want me to do?

661
00:36:48.575 --> 00:36:50.625
Do you think a yoga instructor makes
good money?

662
00:36:50.915 --> 00:36:52.145
Well, I don't.

663
00:36:52.433 --> 00:36:55.863
The owner makes money,
but instructors like me don't.

664
00:36:56.185 --> 00:36:57.654
So, what am I supposed to do?

665
00:36:57.924 --> 00:37:01.455
You're going to leave soon and
my family can't help me.

666
00:37:01.734 --> 00:37:03.575
I have no intention of relying on a man.

667
00:37:03.575 --> 00:37:04.863
So, what should I do?

668
00:37:04.863 --> 00:37:06.897
I have to live too.

669
00:37:06.897 --> 00:37:09.694
Shut your mouth.
I'll kill you if you say one more word.

670
00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:12.125
Who are you to say that? Tell me.

671
00:37:12.125 --> 00:37:13.515
Who are you?

672
00:37:13.515 --> 00:37:15.803
- Why are you acting righteous?
- Who said I was right?

673
00:37:16.357 --> 00:37:19.439
I know that I'm doing something crazy.

674
00:37:20.515 --> 00:37:22.495
I was only going to do it temporarily.

675
00:37:23.598 --> 00:37:26.060
I was going to save 100 million won
just like you.

676
00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.375
Where are you going to use that money?

677
00:37:28.977 --> 00:37:30.058
I don't know.

678
00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:32.756
I'm just scared and that's why I have it.

679
00:37:34.596 --> 00:37:36.221
This is a scary place.

680
00:37:36.542 --> 00:37:38.763
It's a really scary place to live
without money.

681
00:37:40.656 --> 00:37:43.566
Let's go. We'll go home and talk.

682
00:37:43.966 --> 00:37:45.104
I won't go.

683
00:37:46.325 --> 00:37:48.283
I'm going to work. I have to earn money.

684
00:37:48.283 --> 00:37:49.499
Choi Yeon Ji.

685
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.330
Mind your own business.

686
00:37:52.129 --> 00:37:53.310
It's my life.

687
00:38:01.249 --> 00:38:04.104
Wow, it's such a shock.

688
00:38:04.104 --> 00:38:05.723
I feel so bad for her.

689
00:38:05.723 --> 00:38:08.073
Our instructor is working two jobs
like that.

690
00:38:08.073 --> 00:38:11.633
Dan Ah looks smart but she didn't even
notice that?

691
00:38:12.171 --> 00:38:14.140
There are always signs when people
do that job.

692
00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.528
She must've trusted her friend.

693
00:38:16.758 --> 00:38:18.223
It doesn't matter to me.

694
00:38:18.223 --> 00:38:22.517
No matter what Yeon Ji does,
my love will not change.

695
00:38:28.218 --> 00:38:30.678
This won't do.
I need to go to Yeon Ji now.

696
00:38:30.678 --> 00:38:33.109
I need to go and tell her that I
understand everything.

697
00:38:34.287 --> 00:38:35.848
I'll tell her to lean on me.

698
00:38:37.044 --> 00:38:39.560
Gong Gi, you should stay put.

699
00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.430
Just staying put is most helpful in
times like these.

700
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.279
You don't know what you're talking about.

701
00:38:45.279 --> 00:38:48.745
She needs a sincere touch of love
in times like these.

702
00:38:48.745 --> 00:38:50.792
No, you just can't.

703
00:38:50.792 --> 00:38:52.131
- What are you doing? Move.
- No!

704
00:38:52.131 --> 00:38:54.361
- Don't go overboard!
- What's he doing?

705
00:38:54.361 --> 00:38:56.321
- Let me go.
- You can't go!

706
00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:58.408
I have to go.

707
00:38:58.408 --> 00:39:00.238
No, no!

708
00:39:00.238 --> 00:39:02.127
Let me go. I have to go.

709
00:39:02.718 --> 00:39:05.988
Min Chan! Just let me go.

710
00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:08.705
Are you okay?

711
00:39:08.705 --> 00:39:10.272
Do you think I would be okay?

712
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:55.627
I was always suspicious.

713
00:39:57.058 --> 00:39:58.986
Still, I thought she would never.

714
00:39:58.986 --> 00:40:01.424
I never thought she would lie to me.

715
00:40:04.245 --> 00:40:05.830
I was stupid.

716
00:40:07.232 --> 00:40:09.694
I even followed her once.

717
00:40:09.694 --> 00:40:13.071
She said she was drinking with Min Chan,
so I believed her.

718
00:40:13.071 --> 00:40:16.982
She said they were going on dates
every night so I accepted that.

719
00:40:16.982 --> 00:40:19.037
- Min Chan?
- Yes.

720
00:40:21.993 --> 00:40:25.192
I think he knew the whole time.

721
00:40:29.854 --> 00:40:31.531
I guess I'm the only one who didn't know.

722
00:40:33.801 --> 00:40:37.301
We've been friends for 20 years.

723
00:40:37.812 --> 00:40:40.125
I was the only one who didn't know.

724
00:40:40.125 --> 00:40:41.781
Don't blame yourself.

725
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:44.935
Why would you doubt your friend's words?

726
00:40:45.562 --> 00:40:46.725
Kang Soo.

727
00:40:49.834 --> 00:40:52.042
What should I do now?

728
00:40:54.171 --> 00:40:55.991
I really don't know.

729
00:41:01.567 --> 00:41:03.187
Wait for her.

730
00:41:04.417 --> 00:41:06.676
That's what I did for Sung Jae.

731
00:41:07.816 --> 00:41:11.406
He always got in trouble and
people pointed their fingers at him.

732
00:41:12.167 --> 00:41:14.125
I still trusted in him and waited.

733
00:41:14.125 --> 00:41:17.926
The adults in our town said he was a
bad kid and I shouldn't play with him.

734
00:41:18.955 --> 00:41:21.165
Still, I trusted in him and waited.

735
00:41:21.165 --> 00:41:23.354
If he came looking for me,
I was there for him.

736
00:41:24.196 --> 00:41:27.895
If I thought he would be alone,
I would go looking for him.

737
00:41:29.975 --> 00:41:31.946
Eventually, he came back...

738
00:41:32.819 --> 00:41:33.955
to the place he belonged.

739
00:43:07.741 --> 00:43:09.399
There's no special method.

740
00:43:09.399 --> 00:43:11.017
Work hard like you usually do.

741
00:43:11.017 --> 00:43:13.151
Be friendly when you make deliveries.

742
00:43:13.151 --> 00:43:16.093
When they come here to eat,
be courteous and welcoming.

743
00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:17.926
That's all true.

744
00:43:18.243 --> 00:43:20.024
I think we should add one thing.

745
00:43:20.803 --> 00:43:22.113
You know those things...

746
00:43:22.542 --> 00:43:24.354
A more emotional campaign.

747
00:43:24.354 --> 00:43:27.203
Soft humanity, a feeling of eating
at home...

748
00:43:27.593 --> 00:43:31.212
That could work better for people at
a construction company.

749
00:43:31.212 --> 00:43:33.676
If you get to know them well

750
00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.562
even office employees are like
on-site workers.

751
00:43:35.562 --> 00:43:38.216
That's a good idea.
What do you all think?

752
00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:39.441
That is valid.

753
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:42.633
Then I will gather all the restaurant
owners.

754
00:43:42.633 --> 00:43:45.671
This is why there is a director, right?
I will do it.

755
00:43:45.671 --> 00:43:47.841
Okay, you take care of that.

756
00:43:48.611 --> 00:43:51.321
Jin Kyu, you come to Sunjin Construction
with me.

757
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:52.602
- Me?
- Yes.

758
00:43:52.602 --> 00:43:54.950
Help me if I get any difficult questions.

759
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:56.611
Sure, okay.

760
00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.850
"I will do that, CEO Choi."

761
00:44:00.214 --> 00:44:01.290
You're annoying.

762
00:44:02.551 --> 00:44:04.450
Yes, CEO Choi.

763
00:44:06.022 --> 00:44:07.685
Okay, let's get going now.

764
00:44:08.823 --> 00:44:11.883
Oh, by the way, you all got your
pay deposited into your accounts.

765
00:44:12.395 --> 00:44:14.899
- Yes!
- Oh yeah!

766
00:44:17.944 --> 00:44:19.171
How do you feel?

767
00:44:36.497 --> 00:44:37.607
Oh Jin Kyu.

768
00:44:37.607 --> 00:44:39.131
It's been a long time.

769
00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:40.995
What are you doing here?

770
00:44:40.995 --> 00:44:43.689
Ah... I got a new job.

771
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.288
I scouted him.

772
00:44:47.812 --> 00:44:49.709
You even know how to steal people away.

773
00:44:49.709 --> 00:44:53.506
I didn't steal him away.
You lost him.

774
00:44:58.296 --> 00:44:59.975
We'll be inside.

775
00:45:17.584 --> 00:45:20.136
Yes, thank you for your bids.

776
00:45:20.743 --> 00:45:24.321
We will put up the contents of your
bids on our company site.

777
00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:27.194
The employees will vote in three days
and you will have your results.

778
00:45:29.656 --> 00:45:30.734
Oh my.

779
00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:38.044
Was it you who cleaned up my desk,
Manager?

780
00:45:39.042 --> 00:45:41.332
- Yes.
- Ah...

781
00:45:41.993 --> 00:45:43.982
Do you have something to say?

782
00:45:43.982 --> 00:45:46.142
Work hard. It's okay.

783
00:45:46.142 --> 00:45:48.642
They're all ideas I don't even
need anyway.

784
00:45:48.642 --> 00:45:51.174
It's better if someone uses them rather
than rotting in a desk.

785
00:45:51.174 --> 00:45:52.435
Isn't that right, Manager?

786
00:45:53.261 --> 00:45:56.595
Oh, wait... isn't that right,
Branch Manager?

787
00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:00.555
Do you understand?

788
00:46:01.008 --> 00:46:04.654
A meal prepared by your mother,
just like eating at home!

789
00:46:04.654 --> 00:46:06.866
That is what we are going for!

790
00:46:08.156 --> 00:46:11.975
Why did you call the landlords here?

791
00:46:13.325 --> 00:46:15.138
Because we are all one.

792
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:19.846
All right, let's all shout out our motto.

793
00:46:19.846 --> 00:46:21.716
We are one!

794
00:46:21.716 --> 00:46:23.084
We survive as one!

795
00:46:23.084 --> 00:46:24.575
We'll die if we are split!

796
00:46:24.575 --> 00:46:25.814
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

797
00:46:25.814 --> 00:46:27.316
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

798
00:46:34.258 --> 00:46:36.580
Oh my! Come on in.

799
00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.620
I'll prepare you a great meal.

800
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.191
This is on the house.

801
00:46:40.191 --> 00:46:42.692
Yes, please enjoy your meal.

802
00:46:47.604 --> 00:46:52.274
Hello, we'll just go in for a moment
and give the employees a gift.

803
00:46:52.274 --> 00:46:54.696
You cannot. Please leave.

804
00:46:55.125 --> 00:46:56.535
Please go. I'm sorry.

805
00:46:56.535 --> 00:46:57.582
Please leave.

806
00:47:00.278 --> 00:47:02.475
- Hello.
- You may go in.

807
00:47:09.587 --> 00:47:10.950
Your meal is here.

808
00:47:13.283 --> 00:47:15.642
Enjoy your meal.
It's hot so I'll do it for you.

809
00:47:25.939 --> 00:47:29.993
This means "consistent" so it means to
have consistent effect.

810
00:47:29.993 --> 00:47:31.511
Ah, I see.

811
00:47:32.546 --> 00:47:34.158
Oh, your perfume smells nice.

812
00:47:34.158 --> 00:47:35.642
S201, right?

813
00:47:38.716 --> 00:47:39.883
Thank you.

814
00:48:01.714 --> 00:48:03.218
You all worked hard.

815
00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.790
Get home safe.

816
00:48:05.319 --> 00:48:07.517
Sweet dreams everyone.

817
00:48:07.928 --> 00:48:09.096
The vote is tomorrow.

818
00:48:09.096 --> 00:48:11.450
Wow, I'm so nervous.

819
00:48:11.682 --> 00:48:14.734
What if we don't win?
We'll be totally ruined.

820
00:48:14.734 --> 00:48:17.729
Hey, don't say unlucky things.

821
00:48:17.729 --> 00:48:19.671
- Sorry, sorry.
- You all worked hard.

822
00:48:19.671 --> 00:48:21.080
Let's get going.

823
00:48:29.535 --> 00:48:31.582
- You're home early.
- Yeah.

824
00:48:44.283 --> 00:48:46.442
- Are you sick?
- No.

825
00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:50.312
I just came home early.

826
00:48:51.442 --> 00:48:52.903
Then go to bed.

827
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.227
Dan Ah.

828
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:05.029
What?

829
00:49:06.669 --> 00:49:08.250
I'm sorry.

830
00:49:16.408 --> 00:49:19.386
I did it because I was really scared.

831
00:49:21.392 --> 00:49:25.151
I was thinking about living on
without you here.

832
00:49:26.254 --> 00:49:27.767
It was so scary.

833
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.319
Remember what you said?

834
00:49:30.649 --> 00:49:35.551
People who are poor aren't living.
They're just surviving.

835
00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:41.562
I don't even have money,
so how will I last today?

836
00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.279
Where will I get my living expenses
for next month?

837
00:49:46.913 --> 00:49:51.200
I'll just get old and die after worrying
about money like that.

838
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.432
That's why I did it.

839
00:49:55.013 --> 00:49:57.671
That's how the world seemed to me too.

840
00:49:59.002 --> 00:50:04.281
I didn't even have a little bit of hope.

841
00:50:08.982 --> 00:50:10.111
Yeah.

842
00:50:11.955 --> 00:50:13.691
There is no hope.

843
00:50:15.491 --> 00:50:20.441
But, you might be able to make it too.

844
00:50:20.843 --> 00:50:21.930
What?

845
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.607
If you don't do anything,
there's nothing.

846
00:50:28.555 --> 00:50:32.627
But, if you put your mind to it
and try...

847
00:50:33.877 --> 00:50:36.133
I think you could make hope.

848
00:50:36.392 --> 00:50:37.493
Why?

849
00:50:38.897 --> 00:50:39.944
How?

850
00:50:40.258 --> 00:50:41.796
Because of Kang Soo.

851
00:50:42.433 --> 00:50:43.517
What?

852
00:50:43.517 --> 00:50:48.799
I feel like he can make things that way.

853
00:51:12.667 --> 00:51:14.767
<i>[Live as a good person.]</i>

854
00:51:16.805 --> 00:51:18.004
Don't worry.

855
00:51:19.466 --> 00:51:20.642
It will work out.
