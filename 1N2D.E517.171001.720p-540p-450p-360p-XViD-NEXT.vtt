1
00:00:01.362 --> 00:00:02.931
(One Night Two Days)

2
00:00:03.886 --> 00:00:05.915
(A sunny fall day)

3
00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:08.085
(The morning sun sparkles.)

4
00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:10.886
(Thanks to the light fall breeze,)

5
00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:13.195
(it's a good day to be outside.)

6
00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:16.526
(Where are they going today?)

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:22.366
(They gather today under the blue sky.)

8
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.366
Hello.

9
00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:24.936
(They seem excited.)

10
00:00:24.936 --> 00:00:26.875
- Hello. - Hi.

11
00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:29.245
Should I give someone a call?

12
00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.476
What's with the cardigan?

13
00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:33.415
I returned from China...

14
00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:35.275
to a much chillier weather.

15
00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:36.385
It's cold in the morning.

16
00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:37.985
Tell me about it.

17
00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:40.256
I recommend the mountain marathon.

18
00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:42.585
- Really? - Try it.

19
00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:44.826
- Did you have fun? - You'll soon heat up.

20
00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:47.156
(He runs and runs.)

21
00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:48.826
(There's no downhill.)

22
00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:52.466
(We're just glad he made it back alive.)

23
00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:54.536
- Even my brain heated up. - Did you finish it?

24
00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:56.906
- Of course. - I heard he had fun.

25
00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:58.805
- I see. - So what are we...

26
00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.106
supposed to do today?

27
00:01:00.906 --> 00:01:03.975
"Today you're off to Hongcheon."

28
00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:05.946
"You'll find out the theme on your way."

29
00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:08.615
"There are two ways to get there."

30
00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:11.485
"Please choose which car you wish to take."

31
00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:13.356
(Jong Min doesn't understand it.)

32
00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:15.925
We'll be divided into two teams.

33
00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:17.326
These are our rides.

34
00:01:17.526 --> 00:01:19.656
The curtains are drawn in the back.

35
00:01:19.656 --> 00:01:21.526
We'll choose one by one.

36
00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:23.095
It's like that other time.

37
00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:25.296
Could one of it be malfunctioning?

38
00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:27.496
What do we do then? Who'll go first?

39
00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:29.205
- Dong Gu, you go first. - What?

40
00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:31.565
- Why me? - You rarely complain...

41
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:33.636
- so go first. - That's right.

42
00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:36.406
What do you say to me, Joon Ho, and Jong Min...

43
00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:37.746
being a team again?

44
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:39.145
No, thank you.

45
00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:40.845
- Fine. - I won't allow it.

46
00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:42.315
I won't be on your team though.

47
00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:44.416
Give us another chance.

48
00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:45.815
That'd be delightful for us.

49
00:01:45.815 --> 00:01:47.916
- I won't allow it. - Me neither.

50
00:01:48.156 --> 00:01:49.886
We might end up doing a commercial.

51
00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:52.186
- What? - He said commercial.

52
00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:53.326
Stop looking at me.

53
00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:55.026
We should team up again.

54
00:01:55.556 --> 00:01:57.326
You might shoot a naengmyeon commercial.

55
00:01:58.125 --> 00:02:00.136
That's right. A naengmyeon commercial.

56
00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:02.906
- Naengmyeon. - Yes, naengmyeon.

57
00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:04.106
- All right. - Let's be rational.

58
00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:05.505
- We could. - Get on bus number one.

59
00:02:05.505 --> 00:02:08.635
As you can see, there's an eagle on the back.

60
00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:10.706
It seems to be heading to the army.

61
00:02:10.706 --> 00:02:11.776
(The eagle makes a statement.)

62
00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:13.516
That's perfect for you.

63
00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:15.216
Meanwhile, that reminds me of a theater.

64
00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:17.045
(Joon Ho takes a good look at them.)

65
00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:20.415
Between the 2 buses, only 1 is a rental.

66
00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.116
(They're both rentals.)

67
00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:24.385
Wait, they're both rentals.

68
00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:27.855
- Joon Ho? - I choose the right bus.

69
00:02:28.456 --> 00:02:30.396
The bus on the right.

70
00:02:30.695 --> 00:02:32.026
- The one on the right? - Yes.

71
00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:33.396
That means he'll get on the left bus.

72
00:02:33.396 --> 00:02:34.466
Right.

73
00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:35.466
(Stealthy)

74
00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:36.466
The sun is blazing.

75
00:02:37.065 --> 00:02:38.505
They're in different directions.

76
00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:41.035
- So... - What?

77
00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.045
- What was that? - That came from there.

78
00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:47.875
Anyone can tell that it came from the left.

79
00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:50.345
- Tell me about it. - He could've yelled,

80
00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:51.385
then head across.

81
00:02:51.385 --> 00:02:53.616
(Joon Ho wasn't scheming though.)

82
00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:56.785
(He yelled for no reason.)

83
00:02:58.385 --> 00:02:59.456
What is this?

84
00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:01.725
(He's disappointed.)

85
00:03:01.725 --> 00:03:03.766
There's nothing here.

86
00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.396
- Let that team go first. - Sure, go ahead.

87
00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:07.436
- Okay. - Dong Gu, go.

88
00:03:09.306 --> 00:03:10.766
He's going in the other direction.

89
00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:13.535
No, Dong Gu will go to Joon Ho.

90
00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:15.336
He likes this team.

91
00:03:15.906 --> 00:03:18.776
He's been doing well on it too.

92
00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:21.375
He likes teasing Joon Ho and Jong Min.

93
00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:23.616
Yes, exactly.

94
00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:26.755
(Which team will Dong Gu be on?)

95
00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:31.486
(They're on different buses.)

96
00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:35.355
(They fail to join forces again.)

97
00:03:36.825 --> 00:03:38.165
- Go ahead. - Jong Min, go.

98
00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:39.366
(Lastly, Jong Min will choose.)

99
00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.135
Go ahead.

100
00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:43.105
Can we watch which bus you choose?

101
00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:45.336
Why?

102
00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:48.605
I'd like to see which bus you choose.

103
00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:53.516
What now?

104
00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:54.646
(The fool is always cheerful.)

105
00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:56.586
I'm confusing you three.

106
00:03:57.415 --> 00:04:00.016
(It doesn't confuse them at all.)

107
00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:02.285
(Jong Min hops on to the bus on the left.)

108
00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:03.885
(Who will he team up with?)

109
00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:06.195
(Hi, Dong Gu!)

110
00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:08.725
(He's worried that someone might notice.)

111
00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:11.725
- Did you hurt your back? - Yes.

112
00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:13.466
I shouldn't have run.

113
00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:15.165
(The result of his meaningless running)

114
00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:17.605
Two are on the same team while...

115
00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:18.665
Jong Min is on his own.

116
00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:20.876
- Is he on the right bus? - I think so.

117
00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:23.776
I'll get going then. All right.

118
00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:25.816
(Which bus should I choose?)

119
00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:28.376
This will change my destiny today.

120
00:04:29.386 --> 00:04:30.886
My fate hangs in the balance.

121
00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:32.485
He yelled from over here.

122
00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:35.555
I don't care as long as the car is functioning.

123
00:04:35.555 --> 00:04:37.656
We don't need air-conditioning anyway.

124
00:04:37.656 --> 00:04:38.685
(Which bus will Defconn choose?)

125
00:04:41.456 --> 00:04:42.466
Did he choose?

126
00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:45.425
Which one will it be? The right or the left?

127
00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:47.196
Jong Min went on this bus.

128
00:04:47.196 --> 00:04:48.295
You never know.

129
00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:49.336
I'm choosing this one too.

130
00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:50.865
(They want to avoid Jong Min.)

131
00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:55.305
(Who will Joon Young meet on the left bus?)

132
00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:56.376
Jong Min better not be here.

133
00:04:56.376 --> 00:04:57.475
(Who will Joon Young meet on the left bus?)

134
00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:00.876
Yes!

135
00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:01.946
(The team has been filled.)

136
00:05:01.946 --> 00:05:02.985
Yes!

137
00:05:02.985 --> 00:05:04.016
(He's on cloud nine.)

138
00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:05.756
(He's happy to not be on your team!)

139
00:05:05.756 --> 00:05:06.756
It's because of you.

140
00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:08.925
(Laughing)

141
00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:11.586
(Meanwhile Tae Hyun...)

142
00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:15.555
No one's here.

143
00:05:15.896 --> 00:05:18.225
(The bus in empty.)

144
00:05:20.035 --> 00:05:21.136
What... Oh my gosh!

145
00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:22.196
(Honey!)

146
00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:24.136
Gosh, you startled me.

147
00:05:25.406 --> 00:05:27.906
- No way. - Am I invisible to you?

148
00:05:27.906 --> 00:05:29.245
Unbelievable.

149
00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.975
(Joon Young joins the two who are upset.)

150
00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:33.045
Jong Min's on that team!

151
00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:35.946
Didn't you want me here?

152
00:05:35.946 --> 00:05:38.016
- This is good. - Unbelievable.

153
00:05:38.316 --> 00:05:40.785
You made us think someone was here.

154
00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:43.785
Exactly. We thought there'd be a guest.

155
00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:47.156
- That's what I thought. - I can't believe you.

156
00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:50.696
This is the worst team you can ask for.

157
00:05:51.026 --> 00:05:53.365
If you look at our dynamic...

158
00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:54.665
- We're not the best. - No.

159
00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:56.466
We'll get to see...

160
00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:59.105
us two with Defconn instead of Joon Ho.

161
00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:01.475
- That's right. - We'll see what happens.

162
00:06:01.475 --> 00:06:03.946
If we win this week,

163
00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:06.845
it proves that Joon Ho is our weakest link.

164
00:06:06.845 --> 00:06:09.845
Are you Team Neubdari because Joon Ho is old?

165
00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:11.446
Is it?

166
00:06:11.446 --> 00:06:14.485
- Is that it? - No, it's just Neubdari.

167
00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:17.485
(Now that they're divided into teams,)

168
00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:21.095
(the two buses take off. However...)

169
00:06:22.196 --> 00:06:23.466
(There are signs that the members didn't see.)

170
00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.735
Hold on. We're not going the same way.

171
00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:27.566
(Defconn spots the sign.)

172
00:06:27.566 --> 00:06:30.466
The sign reads "Slow Bus to Hongcheon".

173
00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:31.466
- Slow? - That's right.

174
00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:34.175
Could it mean that they're in luck today?

175
00:06:34.506 --> 00:06:37.105
(Their destinies have been chosen.)

176
00:06:38.576 --> 00:06:41.276
What does it mean though?

177
00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.586
An express bus means that there aren't any stops.

178
00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:44.785
A slow bus is the opposite of that.

179
00:06:44.785 --> 00:06:47.185
- Really? - Is it like a slow train?

180
00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:48.216
I think so.

181
00:06:48.216 --> 00:06:49.355
(Then we'll get there faster!)

182
00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:51.855
What's going on?

183
00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:54.925
It's like we're going in circles.

184
00:06:55.156 --> 00:06:57.966
- We'll make a short stop. - What?

185
00:06:57.966 --> 00:06:59.466
(The bus stops for a while.)

186
00:07:00.196 --> 00:07:01.396
(What's going on?)

187
00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:06.506
What's that? Hold on.

188
00:07:06.506 --> 00:07:08.475
- Who is it? - Hello!

189
00:07:09.776 --> 00:07:12.745
(Mysterious guests approach their bus.)

190
00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:14.845
(Who are they?)

191
00:07:14.845 --> 00:07:15.886
Hello.

192
00:07:16.886 --> 00:07:18.316
- Hello. - Hold on.

193
00:07:18.316 --> 00:07:19.386
Hi.

194
00:07:22.156 --> 00:07:23.185
Hello.

195
00:07:24.225 --> 00:07:26.396
(My gosh!)

196
00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:28.995
(The never-ending stream of guests)

197
00:07:28.995 --> 00:07:30.326
What's going on?

198
00:07:30.626 --> 00:07:31.696
What is this?

199
00:07:31.696 --> 00:07:33.165
- My gosh! - Shin Young!

200
00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:35.535
(They keep on coming.)

201
00:07:35.535 --> 00:07:37.805
You've got to be kidding me.

202
00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:39.605
(Familiar faces keep boarding the bus.)

203
00:07:39.605 --> 00:07:40.805
What's going on?

204
00:07:40.906 --> 00:07:43.776
Aren't they supposed to be on another show?

205
00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:45.545
Our bus must be the real deal.

206
00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:46.946
It must be.

207
00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:47.946
(My goodness!)

208
00:07:47.946 --> 00:07:50.485
- Unbelievable. - Please take your seats.

209
00:07:50.485 --> 00:07:51.485
No way.

210
00:07:52.615 --> 00:07:54.886
(The guests await the slow bus.)

211
00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:58.656
Miss. I see you, Narsha.

212
00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:01.396
Shin Young!

213
00:08:01.396 --> 00:08:03.566
- My gosh. - It's nice to see you.

214
00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:07.865
- How have you been? - You look adorable.

215
00:08:07.865 --> 00:08:09.636
- You really do. - Hi!

216
00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.836
Ha Ra, my goodness.

217
00:08:12.105 --> 00:08:13.175
My gosh.

218
00:08:13.175 --> 00:08:15.105
- Welcome. - Hi.

219
00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:17.045
Ha Ra, hi.

220
00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:21.146
("Invincible Youth", the farm life variety show)

221
00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:26.485
(Shin Young was the entertainer of the group.)

222
00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:30.685
(The adorable Koo Ha Ra was 19 at the time.)

223
00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:32.726
(Narsha was bold enough...)

224
00:08:32.726 --> 00:08:34.356
(to rap in front of the elderly.)

225
00:08:34.856 --> 00:08:36.396
(Ha Ra was Narsha's biggest fan.)

226
00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:39.766
(Back then, they were thick as thieves.)

227
00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:43.565
- It's been so long. - I know.

228
00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.136
Isn't the hat out of style?

229
00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:48.535
It's too much with the skirt and everything.

230
00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:51.776
It's how fashionistas dress these days.

231
00:08:51.776 --> 00:08:53.246
It really has been a long time.

232
00:08:53.246 --> 00:08:54.815
How long has it been?

233
00:08:54.815 --> 00:08:57.415
- How old are you now? - I'm 27.

234
00:08:57.415 --> 00:08:58.785
You're now 27?

235
00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:01.116
We met 7 years ago, so you were 20.

236
00:09:01.116 --> 00:09:03.856
I was her age when we shot "Invincible Youth".

237
00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:06.096
- Really? - Truth be told...

238
00:09:06.096 --> 00:09:07.756
- Gyeong Ree! - Hello.

239
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:09.496
- Hi. - Hello.

240
00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:12.996
(She's charismatic on stage.)

241
00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:14.266
This is me forcing to look sexy.

242
00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:17.035
(On variety shows, she's honest and charming.)

243
00:09:18.236 --> 00:09:20.705
- Hello. - Hello.

244
00:09:21.835 --> 00:09:23.476
(She's a member of...)

245
00:09:23.476 --> 00:09:25.075
(a sweet and adorable girl group.)

246
00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:26.776
I know what it is.

247
00:09:28.315 --> 00:09:31.585
(Yu Ra's now a rising star in variety shows.)

248
00:09:32.256 --> 00:09:34.856
We'll be on One Night Two Days today.

249
00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:35.886
(They seem somewhat distant.)

250
00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:39.496
It's still a bit awkward though.

251
00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:40.955
(Awkward)

252
00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.925
Isn't there someone else?

253
00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:46.165
Yes, the youngest will be joining us later.

254
00:09:46.766 --> 00:09:48.736
I hear she's very busy.

255
00:09:49.565 --> 00:09:50.565
(The "Music Bank" dressing room)

256
00:09:50.565 --> 00:09:53.476
(Who is the youngest member or their group?)

257
00:09:55.406 --> 00:09:57.476
- We should do something. - To kill the awkwardness.

258
00:09:57.476 --> 00:09:59.846
Let's say who we like and don't like.

259
00:10:00.276 --> 00:10:01.915
- We'll vote. - Sure.

260
00:10:01.915 --> 00:10:04.085
- Can I say it out loud? - Only who's last.

261
00:10:04.285 --> 00:10:05.445
Yes, only who's last.

262
00:10:05.445 --> 00:10:07.585
- Well... - If we must.

263
00:10:07.986 --> 00:10:10.425
- Right now? - Yes, we can do this.

264
00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:11.425
Do we gather around?

265
00:10:11.425 --> 00:10:12.425
- Who is it? - The least preferred.

266
00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:13.455
Okay.

267
00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:15.156
(Who did they choose?)

268
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.165
- I see. - Right.

269
00:10:17.165 --> 00:10:18.766
- I can't believe it. - Joon Young.

270
00:10:18.766 --> 00:10:21.266
- Luck found you again. - Are you a team?

271
00:10:21.266 --> 00:10:22.835
We were on "Invincible Youth".

272
00:10:22.835 --> 00:10:26.075
The three of us were on "Invincible Youth".

273
00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:27.805
These two weren't.

274
00:10:28.506 --> 00:10:29.846
- "Invincible Youth"? - No way.

275
00:10:30.106 --> 00:10:31.445
Are you all...

276
00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:34.175
- only on this bus? - Yes, only this one.

277
00:10:34.246 --> 00:10:37.315
Is the other team going to Hongcheon...

278
00:10:37.315 --> 00:10:39.685
all by themselves then?

279
00:10:41.256 --> 00:10:42.285
(Boring)

280
00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:44.886
(The express bus is nothing but boring.)

281
00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:49.695
(Tae Hyun calls those on the express bus.)

282
00:10:50.325 --> 00:10:51.526
(He's excited to tease them.)

283
00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:54.035
I'll show you what's going on.

284
00:10:54.396 --> 00:10:55.636
Someone must've joined them.

285
00:10:56.106 --> 00:10:57.266
Here's one.

286
00:10:57.266 --> 00:10:58.766
He's not smiling anymore.

287
00:10:59.435 --> 00:11:02.136
- That's our screenwriter. - Don't be absurd.

288
00:11:02.136 --> 00:11:03.276
(Tae Hyun shows them the back of their heads.)

289
00:11:03.406 --> 00:11:05.305
Look at her long straight hair.

290
00:11:06.575 --> 00:11:07.616
(Giggling)

291
00:11:08.776 --> 00:11:09.945
(Adorable, my gosh)

292
00:11:09.945 --> 00:11:11.415
Look at their faces.

293
00:11:11.415 --> 00:11:12.856
(Why do they seem so happy?)

294
00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:13.955
Show them.

295
00:11:13.955 --> 00:11:15.085
(Last but not least, the fourth guest)

296
00:11:17.026 --> 00:11:18.085
Are they idol singers?

297
00:11:18.955 --> 00:11:20.325
Of course they are.

298
00:11:20.955 --> 00:11:22.726
Who recently came out of hiatus?

299
00:11:23.565 --> 00:11:24.626
A four-member girl group.

300
00:11:24.626 --> 00:11:26.496
- Four members? - That's right.

301
00:11:28.236 --> 00:11:29.705
I think it's Blackpink.

302
00:11:30.506 --> 00:11:33.075
I made the wrong choice. The slow bus is better.

303
00:11:33.075 --> 00:11:35.205
Just think that you're on a school trip...

304
00:11:35.305 --> 00:11:36.445
and have fun.

305
00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:37.906
Gyeong Ree played my girlfriend once.

306
00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:39.075
- Really? - In a music video?

307
00:11:39.075 --> 00:11:42.445
- Yes, on the show... - The video by Unnies.

308
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:44.815
(They played the role of a couple.)

309
00:11:45.715 --> 00:11:46.785
(They even nearly kissed.)

310
00:11:46.785 --> 00:11:47.955
You must be close then.

311
00:11:47.955 --> 00:11:49.285
Yes, I guess.

312
00:11:49.285 --> 00:11:51.126
You don't text often though.

313
00:11:51.126 --> 00:11:52.526
(Dazed)

314
00:11:52.526 --> 00:11:54.055
I don't even know your number.

315
00:11:54.356 --> 00:11:55.695
(Embarrassed)

316
00:11:56.866 --> 00:11:59.465
Isn't it tough to be in a group...

317
00:11:59.565 --> 00:12:00.596
and also fly solo?

318
00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:02.565
Narsha collapsed while weeding a field once.

319
00:12:03.136 --> 00:12:05.236
- Really? - She was exhausted.

320
00:12:05.236 --> 00:12:07.575
We harvested chilies and jujube.

321
00:12:07.575 --> 00:12:08.805
We even drove a tractor.

322
00:12:08.805 --> 00:12:10.006
Yes, that's right.

323
00:12:10.006 --> 00:12:11.205
Don't you have any fun memories?

324
00:12:11.205 --> 00:12:12.205
(We're starting to worry.)

325
00:12:12.976 --> 00:12:14.246
We only remember the hard chores.

326
00:12:15.246 --> 00:12:16.516
(Another unhappy memory is brewing...)

327
00:12:17.585 --> 00:12:19.116
(in the silent express bus.)

328
00:12:20.285 --> 00:12:25.126
(Silence)

329
00:12:26.656 --> 00:12:28.325
(I want to meet the girl group.)

330
00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:33.496
What are you worried about the most today?

331
00:12:33.496 --> 00:12:34.996
I'm worried that I won't get fed.

332
00:12:34.996 --> 00:12:36.906
I'm worried about that too.

333
00:12:36.906 --> 00:12:37.965
Meals and sleeping situations.

334
00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:39.305
It'll be cold outside tonight.

335
00:12:39.575 --> 00:12:40.705
It gets pretty cold.

336
00:12:40.705 --> 00:12:42.136
- It's not that bad. - Does it go below zero?

337
00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.376
It snowed in May in Hongcheon.

338
00:12:44.476 --> 00:12:45.616
You're lying.

339
00:12:45.616 --> 00:12:46.815
It really did snow.

340
00:12:46.915 --> 00:12:48.016
Shin Young, please.

341
00:12:48.016 --> 00:12:49.315
- It's true. - You shouldn't lie.

342
00:12:49.545 --> 00:12:52.386
Tae Woo told me so himself.

343
00:12:52.386 --> 00:12:53.516
I accused him of lying,

344
00:12:53.516 --> 00:12:54.986
but he wasn't.

345
00:12:55.256 --> 00:12:56.955
He probably means it's that cold.

346
00:12:57.055 --> 00:12:59.825
Narsha, give Tae Woo a call then.

347
00:12:59.825 --> 00:13:02.766
Hold on a second. Let's bet on it first.

348
00:13:02.766 --> 00:13:04.425
Losers will get slapped on the neck.

349
00:13:04.425 --> 00:13:07.266
Who believes that it snowed in May?

350
00:13:07.266 --> 00:13:10.305
- Me. - I'll bet on that.

351
00:13:10.305 --> 00:13:11.606
- You too? - Yes.

352
00:13:12.035 --> 00:13:14.636
So it's Gyeong Ree, me, and Joon Ho.

353
00:13:14.736 --> 00:13:16.545
You should call the weather service.

354
00:13:16.906 --> 00:13:18.376
Can't we look it up?

355
00:13:19.016 --> 00:13:21.276
I can call the village foreman.

356
00:13:21.276 --> 00:13:22.445
Do you have his number?

357
00:13:22.445 --> 00:13:23.785
Yes, we kept in touch.

358
00:13:24.545 --> 00:13:25.545
Really?

359
00:13:26.756 --> 00:13:28.455
(Former village foreman Lee Wang Gu)

360
00:13:29.455 --> 00:13:31.726
(He still remains as a legendary entertainer.)

361
00:13:31.726 --> 00:13:33.156
Wang Gu, it's Shin Young.

362
00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:35.396
My gosh, Shin Young!

363
00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:38.626
(No way!)

364
00:13:38.626 --> 00:13:39.665
Right.

365
00:13:39.665 --> 00:13:41.736
Wang Gu, there's something I'd like to ask.

366
00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:43.665
- In Hongcheon. - Yes?

367
00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:45.675
Did it snow in May?

368
00:13:45.776 --> 00:13:49.146
In May, we normally get hail and sleet.

369
00:13:49.146 --> 00:13:51.406
- He said sleet. - It's not snow though.

370
00:13:51.406 --> 00:13:53.746
Snow and sleet are completely different.

371
00:13:53.746 --> 00:13:55.445
- Ask if it snowed once. - Didn't it snow once...

372
00:13:55.445 --> 00:13:57.746
when we were there?

373
00:13:58.116 --> 00:14:00.955
(Well?)

374
00:14:01.055 --> 00:14:03.256
Of course.

375
00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:05.156
(Joyous)

376
00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:07.555
(Miserable)

377
00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:10.366
Thank you. What did I tell you?

378
00:14:10.366 --> 00:14:11.366
You were right.

379
00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:13.096
I never doubted you.

380
00:14:13.195 --> 00:14:15.396
Gyeong Ree, give me five.

381
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.506
I told you to trust me.

382
00:14:16.705 --> 00:14:18.606
- Tae Hyun. - What now?

383
00:14:18.606 --> 00:14:20.175
I'll aim at your Adam's apple.

384
00:14:20.175 --> 00:14:21.835
- No way. - That's so annoying.

385
00:14:21.835 --> 00:14:23.906
- His Adam's apple. - That'll hurt.

386
00:14:24.846 --> 00:14:25.876
Oh no.

387
00:14:26.215 --> 00:14:28.746
(His Adam's apple takes the hit.)

388
00:14:29.646 --> 00:14:30.986
(He's never felt this kind of pain before.)

389
00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:32.815
Who's next?

390
00:14:33.215 --> 00:14:34.656
- I only aim at one place. - Sure.

391
00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:36.085
She doesn't have one.

392
00:14:36.256 --> 00:14:38.925
- It's right here. - Do women have one too?

393
00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:40.096
I'm scared!

394
00:14:40.126 --> 00:14:41.156
(Help me...)

395
00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:44.965
No, not there.

396
00:14:46.366 --> 00:14:47.366
(It ends with a nice slap on the neck.)

397
00:14:47.366 --> 00:14:48.465
That was nice.

398
00:14:48.935 --> 00:14:50.805
Ha Ra has already offered her forehead.

399
00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:52.106
- Are you all right? - Are you?

400
00:14:52.106 --> 00:14:53.535
- Yes, I am. - You know,

401
00:14:53.636 --> 00:14:56.646
I'll try not to upset you.

402
00:14:57.606 --> 00:14:58.805
(A shy slap)

403
00:14:59.715 --> 00:15:01.175
(Laughing)

404
00:15:01.945 --> 00:15:03.085
Her forehead's so round...

405
00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:05.346
that it's perfect to slap.

406
00:15:05.445 --> 00:15:06.516
My gosh.

407
00:15:06.756 --> 00:15:08.285
(Gyeong Ree hits Joon Young.)

408
00:15:09.126 --> 00:15:10.856
(It doesn't hurt, but he feels awful.)

409
00:15:11.126 --> 00:15:12.295
I'm going for your sideburns.

410
00:15:13.026 --> 00:15:15.596
- What? - Sideburns?

411
00:15:15.596 --> 00:15:18.065
My extensions will come out.

412
00:15:18.065 --> 00:15:20.435
- A neck slap then. - Let's go with that.

413
00:15:20.636 --> 00:15:21.665
(She's nervous.)

414
00:15:22.636 --> 00:15:23.665
(Gosh!)

415
00:15:25.035 --> 00:15:26.736
(What a nice sound!)

416
00:15:28.175 --> 00:15:29.445
(Shin Young is great at these penalties.)

417
00:15:30.006 --> 00:15:31.175
You're really good at this.

418
00:15:31.746 --> 00:15:34.545
- I'm fine. - It doesn't hurt though.

419
00:15:34.945 --> 00:15:37.986
I told you that it snows in May.

420
00:15:37.986 --> 00:15:39.656
- Wang Gu... - That's not why...

421
00:15:39.656 --> 00:15:40.915
I was so surprised though.

422
00:15:40.986 --> 00:15:42.156
Was it Wang Gu?

423
00:15:42.156 --> 00:15:43.555
- Yes. - Wang Gu?

424
00:15:43.555 --> 00:15:46.096
I can't believe you actually called him.

425
00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.656
It seemed so natural.

426
00:15:48.356 --> 00:15:51.295
He was delighted to hear your voice as well.

427
00:15:51.896 --> 00:15:53.366
I met that actress,

428
00:15:53.665 --> 00:15:55.965
and she looked me in a meaningful way.

429
00:15:57.106 --> 00:15:58.465
(Who is this actress?)

430
00:15:59.175 --> 00:16:00.705
(Jong Min's already delighted.)

431
00:16:01.305 --> 00:16:02.346
(She answered!)

432
00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:04.976
Hello?

433
00:16:05.746 --> 00:16:07.415
- Hello. - It's her.

434
00:16:07.415 --> 00:16:09.016
- Se Young. - Yes?

435
00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:10.685
(Lee Se Young from "The Best Hit")

436
00:16:10.685 --> 00:16:12.756
I heard something about you recently.

437
00:16:12.756 --> 00:16:14.215
(His cheekbones are up in the sky.)

438
00:16:14.415 --> 00:16:16.226
A friend of mine...

439
00:16:16.455 --> 00:16:19.226
- said that... - She fancies me.

440
00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:20.295
He said that...

441
00:16:20.295 --> 00:16:22.156
you looked at him in a romantic way.

442
00:16:22.156 --> 00:16:25.126
- Me? - Yes. Hold on a second.

443
00:16:25.325 --> 00:16:26.896
Call her by her name.

444
00:16:26.896 --> 00:16:28.665
- Right. - Ask how she's doing.

445
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:30.266
How have you been?

446
00:16:30.266 --> 00:16:31.465
(Cheesy)

447
00:16:31.465 --> 00:16:34.335
Are you Joon Ho?

448
00:16:34.335 --> 00:16:35.506
She thinks he's Joon Ho!

449
00:16:37.445 --> 00:16:38.876
She doesn't know who you are.

450
00:16:39.815 --> 00:16:40.815
Se Yong.

451
00:16:40.815 --> 00:16:42.445
- She doesn't know you. - Jong Min?

452
00:16:43.016 --> 00:16:44.016
See?

453
00:16:44.016 --> 00:16:46.315
- It was obvious. - Of course it's you.

454
00:16:46.486 --> 00:16:47.516
Hi, Se Young.

455
00:16:48.156 --> 00:16:49.156
Hello.

456
00:16:49.156 --> 00:16:50.526
Do you remember the scene...

457
00:16:50.526 --> 00:16:52.126
- we did together? - Sure.

458
00:16:52.325 --> 00:16:54.555
I knew it. You looked at me like...

459
00:16:55.526 --> 00:16:56.925
you were interested.

460
00:16:57.226 --> 00:16:58.295
So...

461
00:16:58.295 --> 00:17:02.565
I played the role of a blind woman.

462
00:17:03.566 --> 00:17:04.965
Her character was blind.

463
00:17:04.965 --> 00:17:06.775
(Jong Min saw what he wanted to see.)

464
00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:08.036
That's more like it.

465
00:17:08.376 --> 00:17:10.146
(Her character had impaired vision,)

466
00:17:11.175 --> 00:17:12.616
(but Jong Min still got excited.)

467
00:17:13.576 --> 00:17:15.175
No wonder.

468
00:17:16.346 --> 00:17:17.415
I'm sorry.

469
00:17:17.415 --> 00:17:18.586
(He put her on a tough spot.)

470
00:17:18.586 --> 00:17:20.185
I really had no choice.

471
00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:22.826
You should visit our show sometime.

472
00:17:23.356 --> 00:17:24.485
Everyone loves you.

473
00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.396
- Go, Se Young. - Go!

474
00:17:26.396 --> 00:17:28.255
- Good luck. - Bye.

475
00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:30.765
We talked to her thanks to Dong Gu,

476
00:17:30.896 --> 00:17:32.896
but I'm still quite lonely.

477
00:17:33.695 --> 00:17:35.765
(They don't know what loneliness is.)

478
00:17:36.005 --> 00:17:37.536
Are you sure?

479
00:17:37.536 --> 00:17:38.836
Are you leaving early tonight?

480
00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:40.106
Of course not.

481
00:17:40.705 --> 00:17:42.036
We're going to stay the night.

482
00:17:42.036 --> 00:17:44.205
- Until morning? - Of course.

483
00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:46.646
I wonder how Driver Lee is doing.

484
00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:48.076
I'm sure he's fine.

485
00:17:48.076 --> 00:17:49.445
Who is Driver Lee?

486
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:51.715
- Driver Lee. - Oh, him.

487
00:17:51.715 --> 00:17:53.316
He was our driver.

488
00:17:54.056 --> 00:17:57.786
He was our driver and manager.

489
00:17:58.056 --> 00:17:59.856
- He's sweet but... - But not when he's drunk.

490
00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:01.225
He always drank though.

491
00:18:01.225 --> 00:18:02.525
That's right.

492
00:18:02.525 --> 00:18:04.296
He never got red in the face though.

493
00:18:05.096 --> 00:18:06.695
He was a good dancer too.

494
00:18:06.695 --> 00:18:07.965
That's right.

495
00:18:08.195 --> 00:18:11.465
He would organize everything for us.

496
00:18:11.536 --> 00:18:12.906
- He was your guide. - Right.

497
00:18:12.906 --> 00:18:14.906
You always went to the same place,

498
00:18:14.906 --> 00:18:16.306
so you made a lot of memories there.

499
00:18:16.306 --> 00:18:17.346
Of course.

500
00:18:18.546 --> 00:18:19.945
(It's been an hour on the road.)

501
00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:23.316
(Everyone's exhausted, so they sleep.)

502
00:18:25.415 --> 00:18:26.656
(Especially her)

503
00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:28.955
(Giggling)

504
00:18:31.056 --> 00:18:32.925
(It's as if her soul has left her body.)

505
00:18:34.695 --> 00:18:37.725
(She has let her guard down.)

506
00:18:42.965 --> 00:18:44.566
(She's still pretty though.)

507
00:18:48.705 --> 00:18:50.205
(The chatter woke her up.)

508
00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:53.376
(She acts as if she never slept.)

509
00:18:56.245 --> 00:18:58.646
He always sleeps because he plays games all night.

510
00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:01.015
(That leaves us with no choice.)

511
00:19:02.255 --> 00:19:03.626
(We'll have to wake him up.)

512
00:19:04.255 --> 00:19:05.255
(Me?)

513
00:19:06.195 --> 00:19:07.195
(It's all right.)

514
00:19:08.896 --> 00:19:10.195
(She let's Shin Young do it instead.)

515
00:19:11.096 --> 00:19:12.165
You do it.

516
00:19:12.165 --> 00:19:13.235
(This is easy.)

517
00:19:14.336 --> 00:19:15.965
(Take that!)

518
00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:17.965
(Annoyed)

519
00:19:19.005 --> 00:19:20.306
(Laughing)

520
00:19:20.306 --> 00:19:22.445
I can't believe he's drooling.

521
00:19:22.675 --> 00:19:24.046
- Joon Ho. - He's hilarious.

522
00:19:24.046 --> 00:19:25.816
I think he's having a nightmare.

523
00:19:25.816 --> 00:19:27.046
Right.

524
00:19:27.046 --> 00:19:29.616
Who was it? Tell me right now.

525
00:19:29.715 --> 00:19:30.745
It was Ha Ra.

526
00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:33.156
(Is that so?)

527
00:19:33.856 --> 00:19:34.886
My behind hurts.

528
00:19:35.586 --> 00:19:38.356
I'm the Master of Revenge, so you better watch out.

529
00:19:38.356 --> 00:19:40.995
- Is he for real? - Show us.

530
00:19:44.826 --> 00:19:45.995
(They finally arrive at their destination.)

531
00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:47.396
It must be someone you know.

532
00:19:48.136 --> 00:19:50.406
- I don't think so. - I have no idea.

533
00:19:50.406 --> 00:19:52.505
The weather's definitely much cooler now.

534
00:19:52.505 --> 00:19:54.576
Tae Hyun was clueless,

535
00:19:54.576 --> 00:19:56.205
so it has to be a girl group.

536
00:19:56.205 --> 00:19:57.576
- Right. - Let's take a photo.

537
00:19:57.975 --> 00:20:00.546
Lower your head, so you're in the frame.

538
00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:01.975
(Hongcheon River Observatory)

539
00:20:01.975 --> 00:20:03.846
(They manage to take a picture.)

540
00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.685
Gosh, that's so bad.

541
00:20:06.356 --> 00:20:07.415
We look awful.

542
00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:08.415
How upset we are shows.

543
00:20:08.415 --> 00:20:10.626
- Let's just sit. - Photos never...

544
00:20:11.326 --> 00:20:12.356
lie.

545
00:20:12.356 --> 00:20:13.896
(We're the unhappiest trio.)

546
00:20:14.896 --> 00:20:16.195
What's taking them so long?

547
00:20:16.195 --> 00:20:18.165
(Their clock couldn't go any slower.)

548
00:20:18.165 --> 00:20:19.536
They seemed to be having a good time.

549
00:20:19.965 --> 00:20:21.836
It has to be a girl group.

550
00:20:21.935 --> 00:20:24.205
- Of course. - Here they come.

551
00:20:24.205 --> 00:20:25.235
Here they come.

552
00:20:25.775 --> 00:20:27.775
(Finally, a bus shows up.)

553
00:20:27.906 --> 00:20:29.005
Hey, it's coming.

554
00:20:30.675 --> 00:20:31.675
It's here.

555
00:20:31.876 --> 00:20:34.376
Hey, keep calm.

556
00:20:34.475 --> 00:20:36.386
You're the one who is the most excited.

557
00:20:36.846 --> 00:20:38.046
Cross your legs.

558
00:20:38.185 --> 00:20:39.415
Try to look cool.

559
00:20:40.685 --> 00:20:43.086
The three are sitting over there.

560
00:20:43.255 --> 00:20:45.455
- They're sitting there. - They're already here.

561
00:20:45.925 --> 00:20:47.626
So it's...

562
00:20:47.626 --> 00:20:49.165
(He ends up ducking out.)

563
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:50.995
We should welcome them.

564
00:20:51.665 --> 00:20:52.965
(Their hearts flutter.)

565
00:20:52.965 --> 00:20:54.836
I wonder who they are. Who could they be?

566
00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:56.036
Should we stand here?

567
00:20:56.836 --> 00:20:59.275
- Don't be like that. - He's right.

568
00:20:59.475 --> 00:21:01.636
Stop overreacting.

569
00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:04.275
You're giving them pressure.

570
00:21:04.275 --> 00:21:05.576
Let's be looking this side.

571
00:21:05.576 --> 00:21:07.415
Can I have some walnut cookies?

572
00:21:07.415 --> 00:21:08.915
Can I go to the restroom?

573
00:21:09.286 --> 00:21:11.245
My whole body aches.

574
00:21:11.386 --> 00:21:13.386
Should we get off first?

575
00:21:13.386 --> 00:21:14.415
(The members get off the bus first.)

576
00:21:14.415 --> 00:21:15.415
Where are we now?

577
00:21:15.856 --> 00:21:17.056
- Hey! - It's you.

578
00:21:18.086 --> 00:21:20.156
Stop pretending to be happy.

579
00:21:20.156 --> 00:21:21.396
They're acting.

580
00:21:21.396 --> 00:21:22.665
They're just pretending.

581
00:21:22.665 --> 00:21:24.366
You guys look so down.

582
00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:26.296
We had so much fun.

583
00:21:26.665 --> 00:21:28.665
Why do you guys look so down?

584
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.735
- It was amazing. - How have you been?

585
00:21:31.735 --> 00:21:33.536
Was it really fun?

586
00:21:33.735 --> 00:21:35.475
It was more like...

587
00:21:35.475 --> 00:21:37.406
sweet. It was lovely.

588
00:21:37.576 --> 00:21:39.146
- Lovely. - Exactly.

589
00:21:39.146 --> 00:21:40.576
Did they feel the same way?

590
00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:43.185
- Why don't you ask them? - They're coming now.

591
00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:44.185
Who are they?

592
00:21:44.185 --> 00:21:47.255
(Expectant)

593
00:21:48.816 --> 00:21:50.856
- Shin Young! - Hello.

594
00:21:50.856 --> 00:21:52.025
- Hello. - Shin Young.

595
00:21:52.025 --> 00:21:53.455
- Hi. - Welcome!

596
00:21:53.455 --> 00:21:54.856
- Nice to see you. - You've lost your weight.

597
00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:55.965
- Hi. - You've become so skinny.

598
00:21:55.965 --> 00:21:57.366
I'm a big fan of yours.

599
00:21:57.366 --> 00:21:59.566
You guys could have welcomed me more.

600
00:21:59.566 --> 00:22:01.296
- Who is it? - It's Koo Ha Ra.

601
00:22:01.366 --> 00:22:03.465
- Ha Ra! - Hello!

602
00:22:04.036 --> 00:22:06.036
- Hello. - It's Ha Ra!

603
00:22:06.036 --> 00:22:07.376
Say hi to her.

604
00:22:07.675 --> 00:22:09.106
You're acting so differently.

605
00:22:09.106 --> 00:22:11.245
- I didn't. - Welcome!

606
00:22:11.876 --> 00:22:13.245
Dong Gu, you too go say hi to her.

607
00:22:13.275 --> 00:22:15.316
- Hello. - Hello.

608
00:22:15.316 --> 00:22:17.646
- Ha Ra, welcome! - She's so pretty.

609
00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:20.156
Here comes the next one.

610
00:22:20.586 --> 00:22:22.556
Narsha!

611
00:22:22.556 --> 00:22:24.255
- Narsha. - Look, he's not moving.

612
00:22:24.255 --> 00:22:26.725
- She's married. - You're unbelievable.

613
00:22:26.725 --> 00:22:29.525
- She's a married woman. - Welcome.

614
00:22:29.525 --> 00:22:31.066
- Narsha. - Hello.

615
00:22:31.066 --> 00:22:32.126
You're married.

616
00:22:32.126 --> 00:22:33.265
- Excuse me? - You're married.

617
00:22:33.265 --> 00:22:35.465
- So what? - I mean...

618
00:22:35.536 --> 00:22:37.265
She can still be a guest.

619
00:22:37.265 --> 00:22:39.406
- Why does that matter? - Narsha.

620
00:22:39.406 --> 00:22:41.675
I feel like we're having Strong Girls Special.

621
00:22:41.675 --> 00:22:43.376
- No. - Am I wrong?

622
00:22:43.376 --> 00:22:45.175
- Yes, you are. - There are more left.

623
00:22:45.175 --> 00:22:46.945
There she comes.

624
00:22:46.945 --> 00:22:48.745
- Yu Ra. - Yu Ra.

625
00:22:48.745 --> 00:22:50.346
- It's Yu Ra. - Hello.

626
00:22:50.886 --> 00:22:52.116
Yu Ra.

627
00:22:52.116 --> 00:22:54.215
- Hello. - Yu Ra.

628
00:22:54.215 --> 00:22:56.185
Why are you coming forward?

629
00:22:56.185 --> 00:22:57.985
You're blocking the camera.

630
00:22:57.985 --> 00:22:58.995
Step aside.

631
00:22:58.995 --> 00:23:00.896
Welcome, Yu Ra.

632
00:23:00.896 --> 00:23:02.695
Don't you see the cameraman?

633
00:23:02.695 --> 00:23:04.596
Why do you keep showing your back?

634
00:23:04.665 --> 00:23:06.265
It's an interesting combination.

635
00:23:06.665 --> 00:23:08.566
What do you have in common?

636
00:23:08.566 --> 00:23:10.066
- There are more coming. - Be patient.

637
00:23:10.066 --> 00:23:12.066
- There are more? - It's amazing.

638
00:23:12.066 --> 00:23:14.536
The next guest is related to beer?

639
00:23:14.536 --> 00:23:15.646
A beer girl is coming.

640
00:23:15.646 --> 00:23:17.175
- A beer girl? - A beer girl.

641
00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:18.775
Jong Min! It's Gyeong Ree!

642
00:23:19.475 --> 00:23:22.116
- It's Gyeong Ree! - It is Gyeong Ree.

643
00:23:22.116 --> 00:23:24.386
- Say hi to her. - It's unbelievable.

644
00:23:24.646 --> 00:23:26.586
My goodness. It's Gyeong Ree.

645
00:23:26.915 --> 00:23:28.015
Why don't you say hi to her?

646
00:23:28.015 --> 00:23:30.156
Hey, go say hi to her.

647
00:23:30.156 --> 00:23:32.025
- Look at him. - He looks so awkward.

648
00:23:32.296 --> 00:23:34.296
I don't understand what kind of combination it is.

649
00:23:34.296 --> 00:23:35.965
I think you can guess. Take a guess.

650
00:23:35.965 --> 00:23:37.765
I think you can also guess.

651
00:23:37.765 --> 00:23:40.136
Jong Min even visited us.

652
00:23:40.136 --> 00:23:41.765
- You two should know. - Really?

653
00:23:41.765 --> 00:23:42.765
- I did? - Yes.

654
00:23:42.765 --> 00:23:44.066
You visited us once.

655
00:23:44.066 --> 00:23:45.465
He doesn't seem to remember.

656
00:23:45.465 --> 00:23:47.705
- DJ. - He was with Chun Hee.

657
00:23:48.005 --> 00:23:49.275
Look at us when we're like this.

658
00:23:49.876 --> 00:23:51.046
(What about these three?)

659
00:23:51.475 --> 00:23:53.376
- Just those three. - Of course I know it.

660
00:23:53.376 --> 00:23:54.745
- You got it. - Yes.

661
00:23:54.745 --> 00:23:56.586
"Six Heroines"?

662
00:23:56.846 --> 00:23:58.485
- Pardon me? - That's a long time ago.

663
00:23:58.485 --> 00:24:00.286
- Kyeong Shil was on it. - And Jung Sun Hee.

664
00:24:00.286 --> 00:24:02.626
- "Invincible Youth"! - Exactly.

665
00:24:02.925 --> 00:24:04.056
- "Invincible Youth". - "Invincible Youth".

666
00:24:04.056 --> 00:24:06.755
We're the "Invincible Youth" members of 2017.

667
00:24:06.755 --> 00:24:09.796
We have new members.

668
00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:12.265
One Night Two Days versus "Invincible Youth".

669
00:24:12.265 --> 00:24:14.566
- That's the theme. - You go over there.

670
00:24:14.566 --> 00:24:15.606
Go next to Gyeong Ree.

671
00:24:15.665 --> 00:24:16.735
(Smiling)

672
00:24:17.366 --> 00:24:18.536
(He casually walks toward her.)

673
00:24:18.536 --> 00:24:20.606
He's actually walking to her.

674
00:24:20.675 --> 00:24:21.975
How awkward it is.

675
00:24:22.745 --> 00:24:26.175
Well, let me be the host of the show today.

676
00:24:26.675 --> 00:24:28.015
- Good. - That sounds lovely.

677
00:24:28.015 --> 00:24:29.786
We normally don't have a host anyway.

678
00:24:29.786 --> 00:24:31.185
- You don't? - No.

679
00:24:31.215 --> 00:24:33.915
- Give me food. - Before we eat,

680
00:24:33.915 --> 00:24:35.755
each members from...

681
00:24:35.755 --> 00:24:37.826
yours and our team will pair up.

682
00:24:37.826 --> 00:24:39.725
(The members from each team will pair up.)

683
00:24:40.725 --> 00:24:42.156
You'll stay alone as a host, right?

684
00:24:42.156 --> 00:24:43.165
No.

685
00:24:43.566 --> 00:24:44.626
Everyone will have a partner.

686
00:24:45.695 --> 00:24:47.636
- What are you saying? - First of all...

687
00:24:47.665 --> 00:24:49.406
Do you need cue cards?

688
00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:51.265
- Cue cards. Yes, please. - There are cue cards?

689
00:24:52.636 --> 00:24:54.876
I like that it's well-organized.

690
00:24:54.876 --> 00:24:56.646
- Me too. - We can just listen.

691
00:24:56.646 --> 00:24:57.646
All we need to do is pair up.

692
00:24:57.646 --> 00:25:00.775
Before we pair up, there's an important announcement.

693
00:25:00.775 --> 00:25:02.146
What is it?

694
00:25:02.146 --> 00:25:03.685
(What is it?)

695
00:25:04.185 --> 00:25:06.886
The members of "Invincible Youth" already...

696
00:25:07.386 --> 00:25:09.556
discussed about their preference.

697
00:25:09.886 --> 00:25:11.725
- My goodness. - It's already discussed.

698
00:25:13.096 --> 00:25:14.856
This is a matter of pride.

699
00:25:14.856 --> 00:25:15.925
- It is. - It is.

700
00:25:15.925 --> 00:25:17.725
Jong Min.

701
00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:18.935
(Me?)

702
00:25:19.366 --> 00:25:20.965
Please go back to your place.

703
00:25:20.965 --> 00:25:22.665
(Please move back so that we can go on smoothly.)

704
00:25:22.665 --> 00:25:23.665
Goodbye.

705
00:25:24.136 --> 00:25:26.205
"Who would you like to be your partner?"

706
00:25:26.205 --> 00:25:27.406
(As soon as the girls arrived,)

707
00:25:27.406 --> 00:25:28.735
Whom should I choose?

708
00:25:28.735 --> 00:25:30.376
(they faced a big problem.)

709
00:25:30.376 --> 00:25:31.546
It's not so easy.

710
00:25:33.116 --> 00:25:34.116
Whom should I choose?

711
00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:35.646
(It's hard to choose one among them.)

712
00:25:35.886 --> 00:25:38.116
This is too difficult.

713
00:25:38.116 --> 00:25:39.955
(It's one of the hardest questions in the world.)

714
00:25:41.786 --> 00:25:43.626
(The mysterious girl also took part.)

715
00:25:45.626 --> 00:25:47.995
(After a long pondering, they filled up the form.)

716
00:25:48.626 --> 00:25:51.925
We ranked the top 3 and the bottom 3.

717
00:25:51.925 --> 00:25:56.165
The bottom three had a really close match.

718
00:25:56.566 --> 00:25:58.566
- Was it that close? - It was really close.

719
00:25:58.566 --> 00:26:01.235
- Really? - I and...

720
00:26:01.235 --> 00:26:04.475
my team members voted. You'll be surprised.

721
00:26:04.475 --> 00:26:06.745
- Is it unexpected? - Some of them are, yes.

722
00:26:07.146 --> 00:26:09.985
I will announce the top three first.

723
00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:12.185
- This makes me nervous. - You go this way.

724
00:26:12.185 --> 00:26:13.556
Goodbye.

725
00:26:13.556 --> 00:26:15.215
As long as I won fourth place, I'm fine.

726
00:26:15.215 --> 00:26:16.685
I wish I win fourth place at least.

727
00:26:17.156 --> 00:26:19.556
- Tell us the result. - The most popular one...

728
00:26:19.556 --> 00:26:21.626
- voted by us is... - It must be Tae Hyun.

729
00:26:21.995 --> 00:26:23.096
It must be Tae Hyun.

730
00:26:23.096 --> 00:26:25.126
(The most popular guy voted by the girls)

731
00:26:25.296 --> 00:26:27.296
- It must be Tae Hyun. - We have joint winners.

732
00:26:27.296 --> 00:26:29.965
(We have joint winners.)

733
00:26:30.606 --> 00:26:32.165
Maybe it's Joon Young and Tae Hyun.

734
00:26:32.376 --> 00:26:33.376
I feel like it's Joon Young.

735
00:26:33.376 --> 00:26:34.505
I think it's Dong Gu.

736
00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:37.275
- I think so too. - It might be Joon Young.

737
00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:39.116
(He is sweating so much.)

738
00:26:39.775 --> 00:26:41.945
(What are they doing?)

739
00:26:41.945 --> 00:26:44.745
You all seem expectant.

740
00:26:44.745 --> 00:26:46.985
What do you mean by expectant?

741
00:26:46.985 --> 00:26:48.415
- To be honest... - Maybe a bit.

742
00:26:48.415 --> 00:26:50.755
To be honest, I am expectant.

743
00:26:50.856 --> 00:26:52.126
What place do you think you are in?

744
00:26:52.126 --> 00:26:53.255
I'll be happy to be ranked in fourth place.

745
00:26:53.255 --> 00:26:54.556
Come on! You can't be in fourth place.

746
00:26:54.556 --> 00:26:56.525
- You're the bottom. - No way.

747
00:26:56.525 --> 00:26:57.896
Then who are ranked below you?

748
00:26:57.896 --> 00:26:59.796
These two.

749
00:27:00.566 --> 00:27:01.836
- It can't be any others. - How can you be so sure?

750
00:27:01.836 --> 00:27:03.066
That's ridiculous.

751
00:27:03.066 --> 00:27:04.136
Who is the least popular normally?

752
00:27:04.136 --> 00:27:05.735
- Normally... - Normally...

753
00:27:05.735 --> 00:27:07.735
- It's neck and neck. - As of appearance...

754
00:27:07.775 --> 00:27:09.775
- It's neck and neck. - It's neck and neck.

755
00:27:09.775 --> 00:27:11.005
It's neck and neck.

756
00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:13.015
I'm good-looking as a comedian,

757
00:27:13.015 --> 00:27:16.116
but they are too ugly to be singers.

758
00:27:16.546 --> 00:27:18.146
They're so ugly.

759
00:27:18.146 --> 00:27:19.786
(Are you picking a fight with us?)

760
00:27:19.786 --> 00:27:21.316
They are both so ugly.

761
00:27:21.316 --> 00:27:23.786
He's got a skin disease on his neck.

762
00:27:24.255 --> 00:27:25.826
Here we go again. Here we go again.

763
00:27:25.826 --> 00:27:27.156
That's not true. I don't have it.

764
00:27:27.156 --> 00:27:28.556
- Here we go again. - It's all healed.

765
00:27:28.556 --> 00:27:30.495
He has a bad breath.

766
00:27:30.665 --> 00:27:32.735
- It's horrible. - Have you smelled it?

767
00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:33.735
My goodness.

768
00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:35.435
Let me announce the joint winners.

769
00:27:35.465 --> 00:27:37.005
Let's see who wins.

770
00:27:37.566 --> 00:27:39.306
The joint winners are...

771
00:27:39.836 --> 00:27:40.836
Tae Hyun!

772
00:27:40.836 --> 00:27:42.306
(As everyone expected, Tae Hyun won first place.)

773
00:27:42.306 --> 00:27:43.646
Congratulations.

774
00:27:43.906 --> 00:27:44.945
Tae Hyun.

775
00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:46.646
(How pathetic.)

776
00:27:46.646 --> 00:27:48.275
- I knew it. - Thank you.

777
00:27:48.275 --> 00:27:51.915
He should be at the bottom to make the show more fun.

778
00:27:51.915 --> 00:27:54.015
It's because they feel comfortable with me.

779
00:27:54.015 --> 00:27:55.786
- The other winner is... - The joint winner.

780
00:27:55.786 --> 00:27:56.786
They tied for first place.

781
00:27:57.826 --> 00:27:58.995
The winner is...

782
00:27:59.455 --> 00:28:01.326
Kim...

783
00:28:01.856 --> 00:28:04.165
- What? - Hey.

784
00:28:04.165 --> 00:28:06.435
- Is it really him? - Hang on a second.

785
00:28:06.636 --> 00:28:07.636
Kim?

786
00:28:08.136 --> 00:28:09.136
(It's an unexpected match between the Kims.)

787
00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:10.165
Kim...

788
00:28:12.705 --> 00:28:13.935
(The rest feel bitter.)

789
00:28:13.935 --> 00:28:15.675
Kim?

790
00:28:16.146 --> 00:28:17.775
- Kim... - This is unbelievable.

791
00:28:18.876 --> 00:28:20.275
- Kim... - Kim...

792
00:28:20.376 --> 00:28:22.346
- Kim J... - Kim J?

793
00:28:22.546 --> 00:28:23.745
Kim J...

794
00:28:23.786 --> 00:28:29.556
- Followed by "o" or "oo"? - Is it "o" or "oo"?

795
00:28:29.556 --> 00:28:31.255
- Kim... - "O"?

796
00:28:31.255 --> 00:28:33.126
(This is a ridiculous situation.)

797
00:28:33.126 --> 00:28:34.826
Kim...

798
00:28:34.826 --> 00:28:36.265
Kim Jong Min!

799
00:28:36.265 --> 00:28:39.036
(Jong Min won first place.)

800
00:28:39.036 --> 00:28:40.165
- Seriously? - No way.

801
00:28:40.396 --> 00:28:42.935
- Congratulations. - Jong Min.

802
00:28:42.935 --> 00:28:45.265
This is a typical variety show.

803
00:28:45.465 --> 00:28:46.606
My gosh.

804
00:28:46.876 --> 00:28:48.205
They're so ugly.

805
00:28:49.646 --> 00:28:51.205
What's wrong with your face?

806
00:28:51.205 --> 00:28:54.046
There must have been a misunderstanding.

807
00:28:54.175 --> 00:28:56.386
Take a closer look at him. He looks like a fish.

808
00:28:57.146 --> 00:28:58.886
- I can't believe it. - My gosh.

809
00:28:58.915 --> 00:29:00.156
How could it be Jong Min?

810
00:29:00.156 --> 00:29:02.185
It's because he's a senior singer. Wait, you are too.

811
00:29:02.185 --> 00:29:03.886
- Yes, I am. - This is amazing.

812
00:29:05.156 --> 00:29:08.126
(Most of the girls chose Tae Hyun and Jong Min.)

813
00:29:09.265 --> 00:29:11.866
(Why did you choose Tae Hyun?)

814
00:29:11.866 --> 00:29:15.866
Tae Hyun is in the center. He's in the center.

815
00:29:17.306 --> 00:29:18.306
Jong Min.

816
00:29:18.306 --> 00:29:20.205
(Why did you choose Jong Min?)

817
00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:21.235
Just because.

818
00:29:22.005 --> 00:29:23.546
Just because he's funny.

819
00:29:24.546 --> 00:29:25.975
(There's no special reason.)

820
00:29:26.275 --> 00:29:28.715
Let me announce who won third place.

821
00:29:29.146 --> 00:29:30.515
- Hey, make it quick. - Hurry up.

822
00:29:30.515 --> 00:29:31.945
It's going to be a match between us anyway.

823
00:29:31.945 --> 00:29:33.685
They must be the bottom two.

824
00:29:33.685 --> 00:29:34.755
It's going to be a match between us anyway.

825
00:29:35.485 --> 00:29:36.685
I'll be quick then. Kim Joon Ho.

826
00:29:36.685 --> 00:29:37.755
(I'll be quick as you wish.)

827
00:29:38.425 --> 00:29:40.755
(For real?)

828
00:29:41.556 --> 00:29:42.566
(Frozen)

829
00:29:42.925 --> 00:29:45.025
- Really? - He looks so happy.

830
00:29:45.126 --> 00:29:46.165
Really?

831
00:29:46.566 --> 00:29:48.765
My goodness.

832
00:29:48.935 --> 00:29:50.505
Step aside, you ugly squids.

833
00:29:50.965 --> 00:29:53.235
Hey, squids. Step aside.

834
00:29:53.775 --> 00:29:56.146
This is annoying.

835
00:29:56.146 --> 00:29:57.146
Step aside.

836
00:29:57.745 --> 00:29:59.576
Step aside, you unlikable brats.

837
00:29:59.576 --> 00:30:01.116
- They're unlikable. - You unlikable brats.

838
00:30:01.116 --> 00:30:02.616
Us likable men should be on the show, not them.

839
00:30:03.485 --> 00:30:05.546
- This is annoying. - It is.

840
00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:07.116
His shoulders are now straightened.

841
00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:10.225
I like you girls.

842
00:30:10.685 --> 00:30:12.626
(It's unbelievable, but he did rank high.)

843
00:30:13.626 --> 00:30:15.356
- Do I get something too? - That's a very good idea.

844
00:30:15.356 --> 00:30:17.725
- No. - I don't?

845
00:30:17.925 --> 00:30:19.036
I'll put this on then.

846
00:30:19.036 --> 00:30:20.036
(He's happy without a crown.)

847
00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:21.296
Fourth place...

848
00:30:21.296 --> 00:30:22.366
(He granted a crown to himself.)

849
00:30:22.636 --> 00:30:23.636
Fourth place...

850
00:30:23.735 --> 00:30:25.465
- Defconn. - It should be Defconn.

851
00:30:25.465 --> 00:30:27.935
- You're right. - That'd be comforting.

852
00:30:27.935 --> 00:30:30.705
- I must be in last place. - This is happening again.

853
00:30:30.806 --> 00:30:32.915
Poor Dong Gu. It should be Dong Gu.

854
00:30:32.915 --> 00:30:34.975
- I know. - I'm worried about him.

855
00:30:35.275 --> 00:30:36.316
Me too.

856
00:30:36.646 --> 00:30:37.985
(With the members' wishes)

857
00:30:37.985 --> 00:30:39.056
Yoon Dong Gu!

858
00:30:40.156 --> 00:30:43.586
(Finally!)

859
00:30:44.755 --> 00:30:46.025
The man next to him, Defconn.

860
00:30:47.725 --> 00:30:49.025
- What is happening? - Yes!

861
00:30:49.126 --> 00:30:50.195
Defconn.

862
00:30:50.195 --> 00:30:51.965
(There's a dramatic reversal in the results.)

863
00:30:51.965 --> 00:30:53.136
What is going on?

864
00:30:53.396 --> 00:30:54.765
That's absurd.

865
00:30:54.765 --> 00:30:56.765
- That can't be true. - This is for real.

866
00:30:56.765 --> 00:30:58.975
- Hey! - I can't believe this.

867
00:30:58.975 --> 00:31:01.735
Dong Gu is supposed to be in fourth place.

868
00:31:01.735 --> 00:31:02.876
The result would be more reliable that way.

869
00:31:02.876 --> 00:31:04.076
This isn't reliable at all.

870
00:31:04.076 --> 00:31:07.015
I'm 100 percent sure this is accurate.

871
00:31:07.015 --> 00:31:10.086
In fact, this isn't about appearance.

872
00:31:10.086 --> 00:31:11.816
- Is it about charms? - It's about charms.

873
00:31:11.816 --> 00:31:12.955
It's all about charms.

874
00:31:12.955 --> 00:31:14.286
That doesn't matter to me.

875
00:31:14.286 --> 00:31:15.925
We're popular anyway.

876
00:31:15.925 --> 00:31:17.485
- Yes, we are. - I know.

877
00:31:18.425 --> 00:31:19.455
Congratulations.

878
00:31:20.126 --> 00:31:21.156
That's ridiculous.

879
00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:26.165
Let's decide the "Out of Face" then.

880
00:31:26.265 --> 00:31:27.366
All right.

881
00:31:27.396 --> 00:31:29.866
- "Out of Face"? - "Out of Face"!

882
00:31:30.505 --> 00:31:32.475
- The sixth place. - This is so funny.

883
00:31:32.475 --> 00:31:34.975
- He got zero votes. - Zero votes.

884
00:31:35.235 --> 00:31:36.275
Zero!

885
00:31:36.546 --> 00:31:39.816
He's the most unpopular one voted by us.

886
00:31:39.816 --> 00:31:40.876
(The most unpopular member)

887
00:31:40.876 --> 00:31:43.086
- Goodness. - This is so annoying.

888
00:31:43.116 --> 00:31:44.146
(Miserable and annoyed)

889
00:31:44.745 --> 00:31:47.415
(They never knew they'd be the last ones left.)

890
00:31:49.386 --> 00:31:50.685
- Yoon Dong Gu! - It's Dong Gu!

891
00:31:51.086 --> 00:31:52.326
- Yoon Dong Gu! - It's Dong Gu!

892
00:31:52.755 --> 00:31:54.056
This is unbelievable.

893
00:31:54.296 --> 00:31:56.195
(We feel so bad for him.)

894
00:31:56.866 --> 00:31:58.096
(Smiling)

895
00:31:58.265 --> 00:31:59.536
The man next to him, Jung Joon Young.

896
00:32:01.396 --> 00:32:03.505
(Revived)

897
00:32:03.505 --> 00:32:04.566
It's Jung Joon Young!

898
00:32:04.566 --> 00:32:06.935
What? What's wrong with Joon Young?

899
00:32:06.935 --> 00:32:08.005
(I want to be alone.)

900
00:32:08.005 --> 00:32:09.646
I knew this was coming.

901
00:32:09.646 --> 00:32:12.245
- He looks good, but... - Reflect on yourself.

902
00:32:12.245 --> 00:32:13.945
- He's right. - girls don't like him.

903
00:32:13.945 --> 00:32:16.846
The reason is simple though.

904
00:32:16.846 --> 00:32:19.286
They have to partner with him here.

905
00:32:19.286 --> 00:32:21.086
But he's just new to them.

906
00:32:21.086 --> 00:32:23.326
We cast our votes without knowing...

907
00:32:23.326 --> 00:32:24.586
- about him. - Exactly.

908
00:32:24.586 --> 00:32:26.255
The results may change by the time this is over.

909
00:32:26.255 --> 00:32:28.126
We never know how it'd change.

910
00:32:28.126 --> 00:32:29.326
Please don't be disappointed.

911
00:32:29.566 --> 00:32:31.165
- It's okay. - It's just a vote.

912
00:32:31.165 --> 00:32:34.195
- I'm okay. - We just did it for fun.

913
00:32:34.195 --> 00:32:36.106
- It's nothing serious. - Right.

914
00:32:36.106 --> 00:32:38.975
Anyway it feels good that they are below me.

915
00:32:38.975 --> 00:32:41.475
I know. I'm glad I'm in third place.

916
00:32:41.475 --> 00:32:42.606
- This feels nice. - Look at them.

917
00:32:42.606 --> 00:32:44.745
I'm so glad that I'm more popular than them.

918
00:32:44.745 --> 00:32:46.015
This is unbelievable.

919
00:32:46.015 --> 00:32:48.215
I will take good care of them today.

920
00:32:48.415 --> 00:32:50.786
Now we should pair up with partners.

921
00:32:50.786 --> 00:32:53.356
In order to do so, we will play...

922
00:32:53.816 --> 00:32:55.086
"Tug of War of Fate".

923
00:32:55.356 --> 00:32:57.156
- "Tug of War of Fate." - I see.

924
00:32:58.225 --> 00:33:02.826
(The members tie a rope around their waist.)

925
00:33:02.826 --> 00:33:08.136
(A member of "Invincible Youth" pulls one rope.)

926
00:33:08.136 --> 00:33:12.705
(Members who are connected by the rope are partners.)

927
00:33:12.975 --> 00:33:15.376
We're 6, but they are only 5.

928
00:33:15.876 --> 00:33:18.106
One more member will come...

929
00:33:18.106 --> 00:33:19.415
after shooting "Music Bank".

930
00:33:20.945 --> 00:33:22.546
One of us will be her partner?

931
00:33:22.546 --> 00:33:24.886
A person who's not chosen will be her partner.

932
00:33:24.886 --> 00:33:25.886
Exactly.

933
00:33:26.185 --> 00:33:27.985
- It's a fate. - They are meant to be.

934
00:33:27.985 --> 00:33:29.386
It's up in the air.

935
00:33:30.056 --> 00:33:32.725
This is more exciting as we don't know her.

936
00:33:33.356 --> 00:33:34.856
(Heart beating)

937
00:33:34.856 --> 00:33:37.725
I need you to stand behind the wall now.

938
00:33:37.725 --> 00:33:39.695
- Okay. - Stand wherever you want.

939
00:33:39.695 --> 00:33:41.765
- Okay, thanks. - This is so exciting.

940
00:33:41.765 --> 00:33:42.765
What?

941
00:33:42.765 --> 00:33:44.265
- Nothing. - Never mind.

942
00:33:45.406 --> 00:33:46.505
It's still summer.

943
00:33:47.435 --> 00:33:49.675
If I pair up with someone, can I go out with her?

944
00:33:50.306 --> 00:33:52.046
What are you talking about?

945
00:33:52.146 --> 00:33:55.245
Do you think this is a blind date or something?

946
00:33:55.245 --> 00:33:57.286
But it never happened.

947
00:33:58.215 --> 00:34:00.286
Nothing like that has happened for 15 years.

948
00:34:00.856 --> 00:34:03.786
You'll never go out with a girl you meet in a show.

949
00:34:05.286 --> 00:34:06.326
Are you ready?

950
00:34:06.326 --> 00:34:07.326
- Yes. - Yes.

951
00:34:07.996 --> 00:34:10.695
Who do you want to be your partner?

952
00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:11.965
Everyone!

953
00:34:12.335 --> 00:34:14.536
- Everyone? - What a Casanova.

954
00:34:14.536 --> 00:34:15.565
All right then.

955
00:34:16.005 --> 00:34:18.206
Gyeong Ree goes first.

956
00:34:19.175 --> 00:34:20.735
(Shouting)

957
00:34:20.735 --> 00:34:22.406
- Gyeong Ree goes first. - It's Gyeong Ree!

958
00:34:22.406 --> 00:34:24.846
- Gyeong Ree! - Gyeong Ree!

959
00:34:24.846 --> 00:34:26.016
Is she pulling a rope?

960
00:34:27.016 --> 00:34:28.275
I'll make them more excited.

961
00:34:29.085 --> 00:34:30.085
They'd be excited.

962
00:34:30.085 --> 00:34:31.116
She's pulling it.

963
00:34:31.116 --> 00:34:32.145
(She stirs their hearts with the ropes.)

964
00:34:32.145 --> 00:34:35.016
This is so funny. Why am I so nervous?

965
00:34:35.315 --> 00:34:37.425
(They are nervous too.)

966
00:34:37.525 --> 00:34:38.556
This is so thrilling.

967
00:34:38.855 --> 00:34:40.295
Mom, I'm getting married.

968
00:34:41.496 --> 00:34:42.996
He said he's getting married.

969
00:34:43.866 --> 00:34:45.766
Who do you want for your partner?

970
00:34:46.096 --> 00:34:47.096
My partner?

971
00:34:47.096 --> 00:34:48.695
(Who do you want for your partner?)

972
00:34:48.695 --> 00:34:50.906
I like Yoon Si Yoon.

973
00:34:50.906 --> 00:34:52.476
(Gyeong Ree chooses Dong Gu.)

974
00:34:53.206 --> 00:34:55.036
It's all about appearance.

975
00:34:55.375 --> 00:34:57.145
Who do you want Gyeong Ree to pick?

976
00:34:57.445 --> 00:34:58.505
I wish she'd pick me.

977
00:34:59.416 --> 00:35:01.076
- I knew it. - All right then.

978
00:35:01.275 --> 00:35:03.286
She'll pull a rope.

979
00:35:03.286 --> 00:35:04.485
- Okay. - I'm so nervous.

980
00:35:05.616 --> 00:35:08.286
- I'm pulling it. - She's pulling it now.

981
00:35:10.886 --> 00:35:12.056
I like your eyes.

982
00:35:12.056 --> 00:35:13.096
(He confesses his love to Gyeong Ree.)

983
00:35:13.826 --> 00:35:15.525
Pull a rope as I count to three.

984
00:35:15.895 --> 00:35:17.096
Why am I so nervous?

985
00:35:17.525 --> 00:35:19.835
If we become partners, it means something.

986
00:35:19.835 --> 00:35:20.895
I know. I agree.

987
00:35:21.235 --> 00:35:22.706
(Surprised)

988
00:35:23.335 --> 00:35:24.565
(Is it Joon Ho?)

989
00:35:25.605 --> 00:35:27.436
(While Jong Min and Joon Ho chat away,)

990
00:35:28.306 --> 00:35:29.906
(he pulls Joon Ho's rope.)

991
00:35:30.675 --> 00:35:31.706
What was that?

992
00:35:31.706 --> 00:35:34.246
Gosh, I can't believe this.

993
00:35:34.246 --> 00:35:35.616
That's so funny.

994
00:35:37.186 --> 00:35:40.715
6, 5, 4, 3,

995
00:35:40.715 --> 00:35:41.916
2, and 1.

996
00:35:41.916 --> 00:35:43.456
Pull a rope!

997
00:35:45.525 --> 00:35:47.795
(What?)

998
00:35:49.565 --> 00:35:50.625
Who is it?

999
00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:52.226
(Who could it be?)

1000
00:35:52.295 --> 00:35:53.295
Who is it?

1001
00:35:54.065 --> 00:35:58.166
(Whose rope did Gyeong Ree pull?)

1002
00:36:02.206 --> 00:36:04.406
(It's Tae Hyun.)

1003
00:36:05.945 --> 00:36:08.045
Now that Gyeong Ree chose Tae Hyun,

1004
00:36:08.045 --> 00:36:11.346
they are partners.

1005
00:36:11.786 --> 00:36:12.786
(The rest of them are outraged.)

1006
00:36:12.786 --> 00:36:13.855
I hate Tae Hyun.

1007
00:36:13.855 --> 00:36:15.956
I can't believe she chose Tae Hyun.

1008
00:36:17.255 --> 00:36:18.855
(Next up is Yu Ra.)

1009
00:36:18.855 --> 00:36:20.156
Yu Ra, who do you want to be your partner?

1010
00:36:20.726 --> 00:36:22.395
- I want Jong Min. - Why?

1011
00:36:22.965 --> 00:36:25.666
- He'd be nice to me. - You think?

1012
00:36:25.666 --> 00:36:27.835
Jong Min, Yu Ra likes you!

1013
00:36:27.835 --> 00:36:29.706
- Who? - Yu Ra likes you.

1014
00:36:29.706 --> 00:36:30.766
It's Yu Ra.

1015
00:36:31.036 --> 00:36:32.605
You can't see her now.

1016
00:36:32.806 --> 00:36:34.275
(She blocks him.)

1017
00:36:34.835 --> 00:36:35.945
I like Yu Ra so much.

1018
00:36:36.976 --> 00:36:40.016
Among the members of One Night Two Days,

1019
00:36:40.016 --> 00:36:41.076
who is your favorite?

1020
00:36:42.215 --> 00:36:44.916
- Jong Min? - Right. It's Jong Min.

1021
00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:45.985
Only him?

1022
00:36:46.286 --> 00:36:48.085
Jong Min and Dong Gu.

1023
00:36:48.186 --> 00:36:49.556
(Yu Ra changes her mind to Dong Gu.)

1024
00:36:49.556 --> 00:36:51.425
- Oh no! - Dong Gu!

1025
00:36:52.156 --> 00:36:54.695
Dong Gu, they all like you.

1026
00:36:54.695 --> 00:36:57.625
- He looks good in person. - Now they saw your face.

1027
00:36:58.266 --> 00:36:59.536
- All right. - She changed her mind?

1028
00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:02.505
I'm sorry, but do you like Dong Gu?

1029
00:37:02.505 --> 00:37:04.136
- They only want Dong Gu? - No, that's not true.

1030
00:37:04.136 --> 00:37:05.406
- Okay. - All right.

1031
00:37:05.406 --> 00:37:08.136
In fact, I like Ha Ra.

1032
00:37:08.136 --> 00:37:09.206
(He changes his mind.)

1033
00:37:10.175 --> 00:37:13.175
What's Yu Ra's choice?

1034
00:37:13.416 --> 00:37:15.246
Yu Ra is pulling a rope now.

1035
00:37:15.246 --> 00:37:17.246
- Yu Ra's pulling a rope. - Yu Ra!

1036
00:37:18.246 --> 00:37:19.956
(She's pulling a rope.)

1037
00:37:21.786 --> 00:37:22.985
Whose voice is that?

1038
00:37:23.686 --> 00:37:24.686
Who is it?

1039
00:37:24.686 --> 00:37:25.695
It's me!

1040
00:37:26.656 --> 00:37:27.895
It's me.

1041
00:37:27.895 --> 00:37:29.795
- Defconn. - Yes, it's me.

1042
00:37:29.795 --> 00:37:31.025
It's Defconn.

1043
00:37:31.565 --> 00:37:33.136
(What?)

1044
00:37:34.065 --> 00:37:37.166
You should do it when we have many members left.

1045
00:37:37.266 --> 00:37:39.875
- You should go first. - It'd be better this way.

1046
00:37:40.105 --> 00:37:41.175
(Next up is Shin Young.)

1047
00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:43.976
- Yu Ra's pulling a rope. - Yu Ra's pulling.

1048
00:37:43.976 --> 00:37:45.005
Yu Ra!

1049
00:37:45.005 --> 00:37:46.016
(They are fooled.)

1050
00:37:46.945 --> 00:37:49.016
("Invincible Youth" casts a fishing rod,)

1051
00:37:49.715 --> 00:37:52.786
(and One Night Two Days takes the bait.)

1052
00:37:53.416 --> 00:37:55.755
It's Defconn!

1053
00:37:55.755 --> 00:37:56.786
(It's Defconn!)

1054
00:37:57.226 --> 00:37:59.456
I knew it. She was very strong.

1055
00:37:59.456 --> 00:38:01.156
Was it you? Okay.

1056
00:38:01.156 --> 00:38:02.766
(Laughing)

1057
00:38:02.766 --> 00:38:04.425
It was me.

1058
00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:06.065
(I'm sorry.)

1059
00:38:07.965 --> 00:38:09.105
(I have to share it with them.)

1060
00:38:09.105 --> 00:38:11.266
It wasn't Yu Ra, everyone.

1061
00:38:11.266 --> 00:38:12.275
Yes!

1062
00:38:13.476 --> 00:38:16.005
It wasn't Yu Ra, everyone.

1063
00:38:16.976 --> 00:38:18.545
(Step aside.)

1064
00:38:18.545 --> 00:38:19.545
Let me see.

1065
00:38:19.545 --> 00:38:23.016
Everyone, I'll take care of Shin Young.

1066
00:38:23.016 --> 00:38:24.116
Yes!

1067
00:38:24.116 --> 00:38:26.516
I'll take care of Defconn.

1068
00:38:26.516 --> 00:38:27.556
(Defconn is on me!)

1069
00:38:27.556 --> 00:38:29.085
She's saying the same thing here.

1070
00:38:30.125 --> 00:38:31.326
Let's do this.

1071
00:38:31.326 --> 00:38:32.395
You totally got me.

1072
00:38:32.395 --> 00:38:33.925
All right. We're partners.

1073
00:38:33.925 --> 00:38:34.956
That was good.

1074
00:38:34.956 --> 00:38:37.465
Now Yu Ra is pulling a rope. It's Yu Ra.

1075
00:38:37.826 --> 00:38:39.436
- Are you sure? - It's Yu Ra for sure.

1076
00:38:39.436 --> 00:38:41.496
- Are you sure? - I think I'll be picked.

1077
00:38:41.496 --> 00:38:42.706
- Nine. - I think it's me.

1078
00:38:42.706 --> 00:38:45.536
- I'm serious. - 8, 7, 6,

1079
00:38:45.536 --> 00:38:47.636
5, 4,

1080
00:38:47.636 --> 00:38:49.275
3, 2,

1081
00:38:49.275 --> 00:38:51.906
- What should I do? - And one!

1082
00:38:51.906 --> 00:38:53.916
(Who will be Yu Ra's partner?)

1083
00:38:53.916 --> 00:38:55.916
- Pull it hard. - Please pull it hard.

1084
00:38:58.746 --> 00:39:03.525
(Who is it?)

1085
00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:13.496
(It's Yu Ra's favorite member, Dong Gu.)

1086
00:39:16.735 --> 00:39:18.436
- He's here. - Here we are.

1087
00:39:19.206 --> 00:39:21.375
Yu Ra said you were her favorite member.

1088
00:39:21.375 --> 00:39:22.976
Right. She chose you.

1089
00:39:22.976 --> 00:39:24.775
She wanted you to be her partner.

1090
00:39:24.775 --> 00:39:25.846
(Would they be good partners?)

1091
00:39:25.846 --> 00:39:27.416
She looks very excited.

1092
00:39:27.416 --> 00:39:31.016
All right. Next up is Narsha.

1093
00:39:31.715 --> 00:39:33.416
- It's Narsha. - Narsha.

1094
00:39:34.016 --> 00:39:35.085
Narsha!

1095
00:39:35.786 --> 00:39:38.186
She described her least favorite member like this.

1096
00:39:38.186 --> 00:39:39.695
"He's a lot of work."

1097
00:39:39.695 --> 00:39:42.326
He requires a great deal of care.

1098
00:39:42.326 --> 00:39:44.366
I don't like that kind of men.

1099
00:39:44.826 --> 00:39:46.436
- Who is it? - But it's one of them.

1100
00:39:46.436 --> 00:39:48.235
Is it Joon Ho?

1101
00:39:48.235 --> 00:39:50.335
My least favorite member is behind the wall.

1102
00:39:50.406 --> 00:39:52.476
It must be Jong Min. It's Jong Min.

1103
00:39:52.936 --> 00:39:54.476
You require a great deal of care.

1104
00:39:55.036 --> 00:39:56.706
We should slap you in the face.

1105
00:39:56.706 --> 00:39:57.846
(In fact, they all require a great deal of care.)

1106
00:39:58.875 --> 00:40:01.375
Okay. I'll choose a rope.

1107
00:40:02.485 --> 00:40:06.056
All right. I'll give you 5 seconds. 5, 4,

1108
00:40:06.056 --> 00:40:09.085
- 3, 2, 1. - 3, 2, 1.

1109
00:40:09.085 --> 00:40:10.826
- It'd be Jong Min. - Pull the rope.

1110
00:40:10.826 --> 00:40:12.456
It'd be funny if she picked Jong Min.

1111
00:40:12.596 --> 00:40:14.025
He requires a great deal of care.

1112
00:40:14.025 --> 00:40:15.195
We don't know it yet.

1113
00:40:15.195 --> 00:40:16.565
- Who is it? - He's not coming out.

1114
00:40:16.565 --> 00:40:18.166
He's trying to stay there.

1115
00:40:18.366 --> 00:40:21.096
He doesn't want to come.

1116
00:40:21.096 --> 00:40:22.166
He does require a great deal of care.

1117
00:40:24.465 --> 00:40:25.806
- Let's see. - He's not coming out.

1118
00:40:25.806 --> 00:40:26.875
- He needs help. - Goodness.

1119
00:40:26.875 --> 00:40:28.675
(It's weak Joon Ho.)

1120
00:40:30.505 --> 00:40:32.175
(He needs a lot of care.)

1121
00:40:32.175 --> 00:40:33.746
- It's Kim Joon Ho. - It's Joon Ho.

1122
00:40:34.076 --> 00:40:35.315
He needs to be taken care of.

1123
00:40:35.985 --> 00:40:37.145
He needs a lot of help.

1124
00:40:37.545 --> 00:40:39.056
- Hi. - Narsha. Hey, Narsha.

1125
00:40:39.315 --> 00:40:40.456
My Narsha.

1126
00:40:41.116 --> 00:40:43.456
- Here comes Koo Ha Ra. - Okay.

1127
00:40:44.355 --> 00:40:47.025
We'll give you one more chance to switch.

1128
00:40:47.556 --> 00:40:49.295
- Let's switch. - Okay.

1129
00:40:49.996 --> 00:40:52.166
(Will this work?)

1130
00:40:53.436 --> 00:40:57.005
Jong Min desperately wanted Ha Ra.

1131
00:40:57.005 --> 00:40:59.235
Who is your number one pick?

1132
00:40:59.735 --> 00:41:00.936
Kim Jong Min.

1133
00:41:02.605 --> 00:41:04.105
- Why? - Kim Jong Min.

1134
00:41:04.105 --> 00:41:05.406
(Seriously, why?)

1135
00:41:06.175 --> 00:41:08.045
- You feel comfortable. - Yes, around him..

1136
00:41:08.045 --> 00:41:09.485
- He doesn't like girls. - That's right.

1137
00:41:10.346 --> 00:41:11.715
(Unfortunately these two are left.)

1138
00:41:12.355 --> 00:41:13.815
Ha Ra, please choose.

1139
00:41:13.815 --> 00:41:16.386
5, 4, 3,

1140
00:41:16.386 --> 00:41:17.925
- 2, 1. - Ha Ra!

1141
00:41:17.925 --> 00:41:19.125
Choose one!

1142
00:41:19.125 --> 00:41:22.496
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a tiger by the toe!

1143
00:41:23.525 --> 00:41:24.625
No way!

1144
00:41:24.826 --> 00:41:26.735
(Gosh! For real?)

1145
00:41:29.666 --> 00:41:32.505
(Even the camera is lost.)

1146
00:41:36.775 --> 00:41:39.045
(It's the strong-willed Cheerful Fool!)

1147
00:41:39.875 --> 00:41:41.215
(Crashing)

1148
00:41:42.916 --> 00:41:44.985
(He lands awkwardly, yet perfectly.)

1149
00:41:45.956 --> 00:41:47.315
(What's that?)

1150
00:41:47.656 --> 00:41:49.456
- What is that? - It's a ring.

1151
00:41:50.186 --> 00:41:52.395
- What is it? - It's a ring.

1152
00:41:54.056 --> 00:41:55.996
- Why would he do that? - Gosh, he's good.

1153
00:41:55.996 --> 00:41:57.326
(Wake up. This isn't "The Bachelorette".)

1154
00:41:57.895 --> 00:41:59.096
He's good at this.

1155
00:41:59.266 --> 00:42:00.965
- He's good. - Goodness.

1156
00:42:00.965 --> 00:42:02.436
- Thanks, Jong Min. - Nice.

1157
00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:03.766
- That was really nice. - Okay.

1158
00:42:03.766 --> 00:42:05.505
- Couples stand here. - Joon Young, come here.

1159
00:42:05.505 --> 00:42:07.536
- He's the youngest. - They'll be a couple.

1160
00:42:07.806 --> 00:42:09.445
The youngest will go with the youngest.

1161
00:42:09.875 --> 00:42:11.476
- I like it a lot. - The youngest couple.

1162
00:42:11.476 --> 00:42:13.416
- It's not bad. - We should do it again.

1163
00:42:13.416 --> 00:42:14.846
- The youngest. - What do you mean?

1164
00:42:14.846 --> 00:42:15.916
The youngest members will be a couple.

1165
00:42:16.945 --> 00:42:19.016
(The youngest member wrote Joon Young.)

1166
00:42:19.656 --> 00:42:20.786
I feel like...

1167
00:42:22.585 --> 00:42:24.985
he's going to abandon me.

1168
00:42:25.186 --> 00:42:26.326
I hope he won't.

1169
00:42:26.326 --> 00:42:27.395
(Will this couple be okay?)

1170
00:42:28.425 --> 00:42:30.726
- Are you hungry? - Yes.

1171
00:42:30.726 --> 00:42:32.195
"Pocket Money Game".

1172
00:42:33.266 --> 00:42:34.596
We have to do this together, right?

1173
00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:35.636
- Yes. - Okay.

1174
00:42:35.766 --> 00:42:37.266
They're like husband and wife MC.

1175
00:42:37.266 --> 00:42:38.976
- That's nice. - They look good together.

1176
00:42:38.976 --> 00:42:41.775
First of all, "Pocket Money Game" is...

1177
00:42:42.076 --> 00:42:44.045
Have you heard of "Front Word Relay"?

1178
00:42:44.145 --> 00:42:45.275
"Front Word Relay"?

1179
00:42:45.275 --> 00:42:47.516
- It's "Front Word Relay". - I've never played that.

1180
00:42:47.576 --> 00:42:48.675
Can you give an example?

1181
00:42:48.675 --> 00:42:50.085
- For example... - Give an example.

1182
00:42:50.085 --> 00:42:52.485
- You'll pick a word. - Okay.

1183
00:42:52.485 --> 00:42:55.456
If "iron" goes to the end

1184
00:42:55.956 --> 00:42:59.395
(What does this mean?)

1185
00:42:59.695 --> 00:43:01.226
"Cider". Like this.

1186
00:43:01.656 --> 00:43:02.766
- That's too hard. - If "iron"...

1187
00:43:02.766 --> 00:43:06.266
- goes to the end - I can't do this.

1188
00:43:06.266 --> 00:43:08.895
If "cider" goes to the end

1189
00:43:08.895 --> 00:43:12.105
- "Lawyer". - That's hard.

1190
00:43:12.706 --> 00:43:14.775
- It's too hard. - Goes to the end

1191
00:43:15.136 --> 00:43:17.406
(Actually, it's not that difficult.)

1192
00:43:18.645 --> 00:43:21.346
(It's very similar to "Word Relay".)

1193
00:43:22.485 --> 00:43:25.145
(You simply need to put the front word last.)

1194
00:43:25.145 --> 00:43:27.016
You have to keep going like this.

1195
00:43:27.016 --> 00:43:28.855
- If "Narsha" goes... - What?

1196
00:43:28.855 --> 00:43:29.985
There's an important rule.

1197
00:43:30.286 --> 00:43:33.195
- If you're off key or... - Slow.

1198
00:43:33.195 --> 00:43:34.755
Then Jong Min will be out.

1199
00:43:34.755 --> 00:43:36.065
Jong Min is a singer.

1200
00:43:36.065 --> 00:43:38.166
- Ha Ra is a singer too. - That's right.

1201
00:43:38.366 --> 00:43:40.695
1st place gets 20 dollars.

1202
00:43:41.965 --> 00:43:43.636
2nd place gets 15 dollars.

1203
00:43:43.636 --> 00:43:44.766
That's enough for a meal.

1204
00:43:44.936 --> 00:43:46.505
3rd place gets 10 dollars.

1205
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:49.206
4th place gets 5 dollars.

1206
00:43:49.206 --> 00:43:50.246
Can you do it?

1207
00:43:50.246 --> 00:43:51.746
- I don't know. - 5th. 3 dollars.

1208
00:43:52.516 --> 00:43:54.016
- Up to 3rd is fine. - 6th gets 1 dollar.

1209
00:43:54.416 --> 00:43:55.985
- What about new words? - Give us time to think.

1210
00:43:55.985 --> 00:43:57.445
You have to proceed with the song.

1211
00:43:57.445 --> 00:43:58.686
- Follow the tempo. - Really?

1212
00:43:58.686 --> 00:44:00.656
- You must. - Don't worry.

1213
00:44:00.656 --> 00:44:02.186
- But I'm worried. - Which way?

1214
00:44:02.886 --> 00:44:03.956
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

1215
00:44:03.956 --> 00:44:05.726
People at the end will do it.

1216
00:44:05.726 --> 00:44:07.226
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Stand in the middle.

1217
00:44:07.795 --> 00:44:09.096
(Joon Young wins!)

1218
00:44:09.395 --> 00:44:11.496
- He won! - Nice.

1219
00:44:11.596 --> 00:44:12.695
You should go first.

1220
00:44:12.695 --> 00:44:14.096
- Our turn won't come. - No, it won't.

1221
00:44:14.096 --> 00:44:15.335
I think the game will stop at Yu Ra.

1222
00:44:15.335 --> 00:44:17.636
- Get ready. - Pick a word.

1223
00:44:17.636 --> 00:44:18.766
Can you sing it again?

1224
00:44:18.766 --> 00:44:19.835
She doesn't know the melody.

1225
00:44:19.835 --> 00:44:23.346
- She's a rapper. - If "iron" goes to...

1226
00:44:23.346 --> 00:44:26.476
(She sounds unstable.)

1227
00:44:26.476 --> 00:44:29.485
- It's a little high. - Ti, do, re, mi, fa, sol.

1228
00:44:29.485 --> 00:44:30.585
Try it.

1229
00:44:30.585 --> 00:44:31.616
(What am I going to do?)

1230
00:44:31.616 --> 00:44:33.215
- Let's go. - Let's do it.

1231
00:44:33.985 --> 00:44:37.085
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1232
00:44:37.456 --> 00:44:38.456
(Nervous)

1233
00:44:39.326 --> 00:44:43.195
If "tea" goes to the end

1234
00:44:43.195 --> 00:44:44.596
- "Yulmu tea". - Wait.

1235
00:44:44.695 --> 00:44:46.465
You can't sing it like that.

1236
00:44:46.465 --> 00:44:47.895
- Wait. It's a remix. - What?

1237
00:44:48.136 --> 00:44:49.666
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1238
00:44:49.666 --> 00:44:52.235
- If "tea" goes... - No.

1239
00:44:52.235 --> 00:44:54.235
You have to start right away.

1240
00:44:54.235 --> 00:44:56.175
- Give her a new word. - A different word.

1241
00:44:56.175 --> 00:44:58.645
- That won't work. - Why not?

1242
00:44:58.645 --> 00:44:59.775
- A different one. - No.

1243
00:44:59.945 --> 00:45:03.315
If you say "yulmu tea", I have to do "yul" next.

1244
00:45:04.715 --> 00:45:06.215
- Right. - Okay.

1245
00:45:06.886 --> 00:45:10.025
If "pine" goes to the end

1246
00:45:10.286 --> 00:45:12.795
(I can do this.)

1247
00:45:12.795 --> 00:45:14.496
(If "pine" goes to the end)

1248
00:45:14.496 --> 00:45:15.996
"Factory".

1249
00:45:16.096 --> 00:45:19.195
If "factory" goes to the end

1250
00:45:19.565 --> 00:45:21.096
"Film fest".

1251
00:45:21.096 --> 00:45:24.335
If "film" goes to the end

1252
00:45:25.166 --> 00:45:26.476
"Lee Mi Young".

1253
00:45:26.476 --> 00:45:27.706
(Lee Mi Young!)

1254
00:45:27.706 --> 00:45:28.706
What?

1255
00:45:29.675 --> 00:45:30.906
Who is Lee Mi Young?

1256
00:45:30.906 --> 00:45:32.476
Isn't she the one who always calls?

1257
00:45:32.476 --> 00:45:34.045
- That's Kim Mi Young. - Manager Kim.

1258
00:45:34.045 --> 00:45:35.416
I got a call from Lee Mi Young.

1259
00:45:35.476 --> 00:45:38.145
- You can't do that. - Anyone can say a name.

1260
00:45:38.145 --> 00:45:39.315
I can just pick a name.

1261
00:45:39.315 --> 00:45:41.056
Don't you get messages from Lee Mi Young?

1262
00:45:41.255 --> 00:45:42.556
- No. - That's Kim Mi Young.

1263
00:45:42.556 --> 00:45:44.186
- All right. - It should've been Kim.

1264
00:45:44.186 --> 00:45:45.596
- You're out. - Tae Hyun is out.

1265
00:45:45.596 --> 00:45:46.726
Let's move closer.

1266
00:45:46.726 --> 00:45:48.895
People's names aren't allowed, are they?

1267
00:45:48.895 --> 00:45:51.965
Famous people's names are okay.

1268
00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:53.795
- All right. - Start with Yu Ra.

1269
00:45:53.795 --> 00:45:55.436
- Me again? - Start with Gyeong Ree.

1270
00:45:55.436 --> 00:45:56.536
You're so mean.

1271
00:45:57.406 --> 00:46:00.706
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1272
00:46:00.706 --> 00:46:03.875
If "pine" goes to the end

1273
00:46:03.875 --> 00:46:05.505
"Barber shop".

1274
00:46:05.505 --> 00:46:08.746
If "barber" goes to the end

1275
00:46:08.746 --> 00:46:10.516
"Ya yee".

1276
00:46:11.116 --> 00:46:12.656
- What? - "Ya yee"?

1277
00:46:12.656 --> 00:46:15.016
- What's that? - That was an easy one.

1278
00:46:15.016 --> 00:46:16.355
I can't change it to "lee".

1279
00:46:16.355 --> 00:46:19.295
- Yes, you can. - Either "yee" or "lee".

1280
00:46:19.295 --> 00:46:20.726
- Anyway, you're out. - You failed.

1281
00:46:20.726 --> 00:46:23.925
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1282
00:46:24.025 --> 00:46:27.195
If "radio" goes to the end

1283
00:46:27.235 --> 00:46:28.465
"Form".

1284
00:46:28.766 --> 00:46:30.036
- "Form". - What?

1285
00:46:30.036 --> 00:46:32.436
- Form what? - It was "radio".

1286
00:46:32.436 --> 00:46:34.175
It's because I have astigmatism.

1287
00:46:34.735 --> 00:46:35.945
- I'm sorry. - Let's go.

1288
00:46:35.945 --> 00:46:37.206
- Let's do this. - Step back if you're out.

1289
00:46:37.206 --> 00:46:38.875
- Step aside. - We can do it.

1290
00:46:38.875 --> 00:46:42.116
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1291
00:46:42.116 --> 00:46:45.186
If "car" goes to the end

1292
00:46:45.186 --> 00:46:46.886
"Sa Mi Ja".

1293
00:46:46.886 --> 00:46:49.886
- If "Sa" goes to the end - If "Sa" goes to the end

1294
00:46:49.886 --> 00:46:51.386
- "Lawyer". - Gosh.

1295
00:46:51.386 --> 00:46:54.355
If "lawyer" goes to the end

1296
00:46:54.355 --> 00:46:56.826
"Feces".

1297
00:46:56.895 --> 00:46:59.065
- "Feces"? - Hey. Wait.

1298
00:46:59.065 --> 00:47:01.766
- That's wrong. - That was very cute.

1299
00:47:01.866 --> 00:47:03.666
- Can "feces" work? - Can "feces" work?

1300
00:47:03.936 --> 00:47:05.005
(No)

1301
00:47:05.675 --> 00:47:07.235
- I'm dizzy. - Joon Ho.

1302
00:47:07.235 --> 00:47:08.406
Let's just ignore the rules.

1303
00:47:08.406 --> 00:47:10.306
Wait a minute.

1304
00:47:10.306 --> 00:47:12.315
Joon Young hasn't said a word.

1305
00:47:12.875 --> 00:47:14.315
- But he's still playing. - He has an advantage.

1306
00:47:14.315 --> 00:47:17.315
The ones who go first is disadvantaged.

1307
00:47:17.315 --> 00:47:18.545
- It's unfair. - The order matters.

1308
00:47:18.545 --> 00:47:20.556
- You're right. - Okay. Joon Ho.

1309
00:47:20.556 --> 00:47:22.056
- "Form". - "Form".

1310
00:47:22.056 --> 00:47:23.255
Let's slow down.

1311
00:47:23.255 --> 00:47:26.425
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1312
00:47:26.425 --> 00:47:27.556
(We won't slow down!)

1313
00:47:28.195 --> 00:47:30.965
If "rubber" goes to the end

1314
00:47:30.965 --> 00:47:32.335
"Sinmungo".

1315
00:47:32.335 --> 00:47:35.295
- If "Sin" goes to the end - If "Sin" goes to the end

1316
00:47:35.295 --> 00:47:36.735
(If "Sin" goes to the end...)

1317
00:47:36.735 --> 00:47:38.565
"Ja Man Si".

1318
00:47:39.076 --> 00:47:40.536
- "Ja Man Si"? - What?

1319
00:47:40.536 --> 00:47:42.346
- "Ja Man Si"? - What is that?

1320
00:47:42.346 --> 00:47:46.045
Does that word mean arrogant? "Ja Man Si"?

1321
00:47:46.945 --> 00:47:48.645
- He's out. - Joon Young failed.

1322
00:47:48.775 --> 00:47:50.945
- Let's go. - Let's play.

1323
00:47:50.945 --> 00:47:52.186
You'll fail this time, Yu Ra.

1324
00:47:52.186 --> 00:47:54.715
- Start with Yu Ra. - Everyone fail. Quickly.

1325
00:47:54.715 --> 00:47:55.755
We'll go fast this time.

1326
00:47:55.755 --> 00:47:58.585
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1327
00:47:58.826 --> 00:47:59.855
(Bye, Yu Ra.)

1328
00:48:00.425 --> 00:48:01.456
(Nervous)

1329
00:48:01.456 --> 00:48:03.666
If "Wednesday" goes to the end

1330
00:48:06.795 --> 00:48:08.266
- It's worked. - She's out.

1331
00:48:08.266 --> 00:48:10.036
- If "Wednesday" goes... - It's hard.

1332
00:48:10.306 --> 00:48:12.406
- "Best". - "Cold water"!

1333
00:48:12.406 --> 00:48:14.235
- "Cold water". - Right.

1334
00:48:14.235 --> 00:48:16.145
- "Arisu". - "Cold water".

1335
00:48:16.145 --> 00:48:18.875
- "Ha Ri Su". - "Arisu".

1336
00:48:18.875 --> 00:48:21.675
- "Palm tree". - "Cold water".

1337
00:48:21.675 --> 00:48:23.346
"Park Myeong Soo". There are many words.

1338
00:48:23.346 --> 00:48:26.186
It was too fast. We'll go slow with Dong Gu.

1339
00:48:26.286 --> 00:48:27.355
Yu Ra is out.

1340
00:48:27.416 --> 00:48:28.485
(Yu Ra gets a dollar.)

1341
00:48:28.886 --> 00:48:30.456
- Start with Dong Gu. - Hurry.

1342
00:48:30.456 --> 00:48:32.695
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1343
00:48:33.025 --> 00:48:35.195
If "subway" goes to the end

1344
00:48:35.195 --> 00:48:36.226
"Newspaper".

1345
00:48:36.226 --> 00:48:38.666
If "newspaper" goes to the end

1346
00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:39.695
"Yoon Jong Shin".

1347
00:48:39.795 --> 00:48:42.965
If "Yoon" goes to the end

1348
00:48:42.965 --> 00:48:44.866
(If "Yoon" goes to the end...)

1349
00:48:44.866 --> 00:48:46.105
"Hwi Bal Yoon"!

1350
00:48:46.105 --> 00:48:47.235
("Hwi Bal Yoon"?)

1351
00:48:47.335 --> 00:48:48.536
- What? - "Hwi Bal Yoon"?

1352
00:48:49.275 --> 00:48:50.775
- What's that? - "Hwi Bal Yoon"?

1353
00:48:50.775 --> 00:48:51.875
That's a good one.

1354
00:48:51.875 --> 00:48:52.945
(Ha Ra, the variety queen, returns!)

1355
00:48:52.945 --> 00:48:54.016
- Awesome. - Good job.

1356
00:48:54.116 --> 00:48:55.786
- Is there such a thing? - "Hwi Bal Yoon"?

1357
00:48:55.786 --> 00:48:58.215
- She said "Hwi Bal Yoon". - The way she said it,

1358
00:48:58.215 --> 00:48:59.985
it sounded like a swear word.

1359
00:48:59.985 --> 00:49:02.016
- "Hwi Bal Yoon". - Goodness.

1360
00:49:02.016 --> 00:49:03.255
"Hwi Bal Yoon".

1361
00:49:03.355 --> 00:49:04.925
(Ha Ra gets three dollars.)

1362
00:49:05.326 --> 00:49:08.025
- Gyeong Ree is amazing. - Nice.

1363
00:49:08.025 --> 00:49:09.866
- Here we go. - Okay.

1364
00:49:09.866 --> 00:49:12.226
- 5, 6, 7. 8. - Go slowly.

1365
00:49:12.226 --> 00:49:14.536
If "scholarship" goes to the end

1366
00:49:14.536 --> 00:49:15.866
"Barber store".

1367

If "cavity" goes to the end

1370
00:49:22.476 --> 00:49:24.605
- "Cavity"? - Yes.

1371
00:49:24.605 --> 00:49:26.076
- Get out! - Wait.

1372
00:49:26.076 --> 00:49:27.675
What did you say earlier? "Barber store"?

1373
00:49:27.675 --> 00:49:30.016
"Barber store" doesn't exist.

1374
00:49:30.346 --> 00:49:31.616
(No results)

1375
00:49:32.355 --> 00:49:33.815
- "Barber store"? - It doesn't exist.

1376
00:49:33.815 --> 00:49:34.855
"Barber store" is a fail.

1377
00:49:34.956 --> 00:49:36.355
(Dong Gu is saved!)

1378
00:49:36.355 --> 00:49:37.755
- I'm saved! - Who was it?

1379
00:49:37.755 --> 00:49:38.886
- Who got it wrong? - Jong Min is out.

1380
00:49:38.886 --> 00:49:39.996
"Barber store" doesn't exist.

1381
00:49:39.996 --> 00:49:41.695
- "Barber shop". - "Shoe storage".

1382
00:49:41.695 --> 00:49:44.366
- Awesome. - We'll go slow.

1383
00:49:44.366 --> 00:49:46.266
If "scholarship" goes to the end

1384
00:49:46.266 --> 00:49:47.395
(Get lost, Joon Ho!)

1385
00:49:47.936 --> 00:49:50.105
If "scholarship" goes to the end

1386
00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:53.036
"Ga Uh Ah".

1387
00:49:54.206 --> 00:49:55.235
"Ga Uh Ah".

1388
00:49:55.235 --> 00:49:57.846
- What's that? - "Ga Uh Ah".

1389
00:49:57.846 --> 00:49:59.275
- Come on. - "Ga Uh Ah".

1390
00:49:59.275 --> 00:50:00.375
- He's out. - Yes.

1391
00:50:00.375 --> 00:50:01.616
Singing it fast isn't easy.

1392
00:50:01.945 --> 00:50:03.386
(Joon Ho gets 10 dollars.)

1393
00:50:03.386 --> 00:50:04.746
Gyeong Ree, you're good.

1394
00:50:04.746 --> 00:50:07.516
- She's good. - She got everything.

1395
00:50:08.355 --> 00:50:10.585
- Gosh. - I'm really lucky.

1396
00:50:10.956 --> 00:50:14.395
I'm going to slow down for these two.

1397
00:50:14.395 --> 00:50:15.895
- All right, guys? - Yes.

1398
00:50:15.895 --> 00:50:17.226
- Give me a dollar. - Okay.

1399
00:50:17.666 --> 00:50:21.866
- Let's do this. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1400
00:50:21.965 --> 00:50:25.835
If "mountain" goes to the end

1401
00:50:25.976 --> 00:50:27.576
"Bald mountain".

1402
00:50:27.675 --> 00:50:31.375
If "bald" goes to the end

1403
00:50:31.976 --> 00:50:33.215
"Xiaomin".

1404
00:50:33.215 --> 00:50:34.875
- "Xiaomin"? - "Xiaomin"?

1405
00:50:34.875 --> 00:50:36.786
- What's that? - "Xiaomin"?

1406
00:50:36.985 --> 00:50:38.386
- That's too random. - Oh, boy.

1407
00:50:38.386 --> 00:50:40.056
Isn't there a word like that?

1408
00:50:40.056 --> 00:50:41.255
(Gyeong Ree gets 15 dollars.)

1409
00:50:41.255 --> 00:50:42.485
- Dong Gu wins! - Yes!

1410
00:50:42.525 --> 00:50:44.085
- Go, Dong Gu! - He won!

1411
00:50:44.085 --> 00:50:46.956
Dong Gu won, so he gets 20 dollars.

1412
00:50:46.956 --> 00:50:49.666
- Congratulations. - He's good.

1413
00:50:49.666 --> 00:50:51.166
- Thanks. - You said you'd help me.

1414
00:50:51.166 --> 00:50:52.766
Since Shin Young worked hard,

1415
00:50:53.065 --> 00:50:54.666
- here. - I'm sure it's empty.

1416
00:50:54.666 --> 00:50:56.366
- It's 100 percent empty. - It's obvious.

1417
00:50:56.465 --> 00:50:57.766
Obvious jokes.

1418
00:50:57.766 --> 00:50:59.235
Obvious jokes.

1419
00:51:00.275 --> 00:51:03.406
Please use your money to eat your lunch.

1420
00:51:03.476 --> 00:51:05.645
I'll wipe the ground for you.

1421
00:51:06.145 --> 00:51:07.145
Let's go.

1422
00:51:09.085 --> 00:51:10.286
- All right. - Where should we go?

1423
00:51:10.516 --> 00:51:12.855
You should give me your money first.

1424
00:51:13.215 --> 00:51:14.786
- Really? - I'll pay with it.

1425
00:51:14.786 --> 00:51:17.485
- Are you sure? - Women handle money.

1426
00:51:19.195 --> 00:51:20.596
- Already? - Give it to me.

1427
00:51:20.596 --> 00:51:22.395
- Isn't it too soon? - Come on.

1428
00:51:22.395 --> 00:51:23.826
- All right. - Hurry.

1429
00:51:23.965 --> 00:51:25.525
- Let's go eat. - Okay.

1430
00:51:26.335 --> 00:51:29.605
Do I have to save this money?

1431
00:51:29.605 --> 00:51:31.835
- Or... - No, we can spend it all.

1432
00:51:31.835 --> 00:51:33.835
Really? That sounds like a lie.

1433
00:51:34.036 --> 00:51:36.576
No, it's no use saving it.

1434
00:51:36.576 --> 00:51:37.576
Shouldn't I leave some?

1435
00:51:37.576 --> 00:51:38.875
- It's no use. - No?

1436
00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:40.846
- It only makes me stingy? - Yes.

1437
00:51:41.076 --> 00:51:43.045
We tried saving money, but there was no point.

1438
00:51:43.045 --> 00:51:44.045
Okay.

1439
00:51:44.315 --> 00:51:45.715
What food do you like?

1440
00:51:46.215 --> 00:51:48.755
I like any food, but all I need is iced coffee.

1441
00:51:48.786 --> 00:51:50.386
I can drink anything but coffee.

1442
00:51:50.485 --> 00:51:52.395
What about this? I'll have iced coffee,

1443
00:51:52.395 --> 00:51:54.456
and you can eat the food you want.

1444
00:51:54.596 --> 00:51:55.726
I'm sorry,

1445
00:51:56.025 --> 00:51:57.666
but technically, this is an individual game.

1446
00:51:57.666 --> 00:51:59.695
This 10 dollars is my money.

1447
00:52:00.335 --> 00:52:02.866
Let me borrow it. I'll pay you back.

1448
00:52:02.866 --> 00:52:04.465
You can't do that.

1449
00:52:04.465 --> 00:52:07.936
1 dollar on this show is like 10,000 dollars.

1450
00:52:07.936 --> 00:52:10.505
- One soybean stew and... - Okay.

1451
00:52:10.505 --> 00:52:12.005
That's 5.5 dollars.

1452
00:52:12.175 --> 00:52:13.215
What about jjajangmyeon?

1453
00:52:13.215 --> 00:52:15.076
- You want jjajangmyeon? - Yes.

1454
00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:16.886
You still should eat something.

1455
00:52:17.186 --> 00:52:18.715
- Will you buy it for me? - Of course.

1456
00:52:19.315 --> 00:52:20.985
I'll have marsh snail hangover soup then.

1457
00:52:20.985 --> 00:52:22.985
- Hangover soup? - No.

1458
00:52:22.985 --> 00:52:25.795
Please cancel that. She's new to our show.

1459
00:52:26.425 --> 00:52:27.855
She doesn't know how to handle money.

1460
00:52:28.025 --> 00:52:29.996
- You like ramyeon, right? - I do.

1461
00:52:31.226 --> 00:52:33.766
If you'll pay for it, I'll eat ramyeon.

1462
00:52:34.195 --> 00:52:35.465
- All right. - Okay.

1463
00:52:35.465 --> 00:52:36.806
Two ramyeon, please.

1464
00:52:37.235 --> 00:52:38.936
Cutie Pie, come on.

1465
00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:41.036
Hurry up, Cutie Pie.

1466
00:52:41.076 --> 00:52:43.076
We should follow the richest team.

1467
00:52:43.145 --> 00:52:45.275
Hurry up. Go and be nice to Dong Gu.

1468
00:52:46.616 --> 00:52:48.576
- Hey. - Hello.

1469
00:52:48.576 --> 00:52:50.516
- Hello. - You're very hardworking.

1470
00:52:50.516 --> 00:52:51.886
Hi, Shin Young.

1471
00:52:51.886 --> 00:52:53.715
Ramyeon is 3 dollars, so Dong Gu can buy 4.

1472
00:52:53.715 --> 00:52:55.925
Shouldn't we have two ramyeon?

1473
00:52:55.956 --> 00:52:57.226
- Two ramyeon, please. - And a bowl of rice.

1474
00:52:57.226 --> 00:52:58.355
That sounds great.

1475
00:52:58.355 --> 00:52:59.855
- Two ramyeon and rice? - Yes.

1476
00:52:59.855 --> 00:53:02.025
- Is the rice a dollar? - It is.

1477
00:53:02.025 --> 00:53:04.366
Jong Min, doesn't that leave you a dollar?

1478
00:53:04.366 --> 00:53:05.866
- No. - You still have a dollar.

1479
00:53:05.866 --> 00:53:07.295
- We don't. - You don't?

1480
00:53:08.295 --> 00:53:10.065
- Hey, they have a dollar. - Do you?

1481
00:53:10.065 --> 00:53:11.766
- It's for the coffee. - Just for the coffee.

1482
00:53:11.835 --> 00:53:13.605
You don't need to drink coffee.

1483
00:53:13.605 --> 00:53:14.675
Thank you.

1484
00:53:14.675 --> 00:53:17.306
- Hello. - Here come the VIPs.

1485
00:53:17.306 --> 00:53:18.576
We're VIPs.

1486
00:53:18.576 --> 00:53:20.045
They have Korean food.

1487
00:53:20.445 --> 00:53:23.445
We'll have soybean stew and tonkatsu.

1488
00:53:23.445 --> 00:53:24.916
Just a moment, please.

1489
00:53:24.985 --> 00:53:26.886
For soybean stew and tonkatsu,

1490
00:53:26.886 --> 00:53:28.516
it'll be 14.5 dollars.

1491
00:53:28.516 --> 00:53:30.625
Give it to me. I'll deliver it to you.

1492
00:53:30.755 --> 00:53:32.795
- Let us get it for you. - We're having great food.

1493
00:53:32.795 --> 00:53:35.156
- Let us. - It's that way.

1494
00:53:35.156 --> 00:53:36.166
(They'll reward us.)

1495
00:53:36.766 --> 00:53:37.965
Here are the beggars.

1496
00:53:38.195 --> 00:53:39.465
What did you order?

1497
00:53:39.496 --> 00:53:41.565
Don't talk to them. Don't even look at them.

1498
00:53:41.565 --> 00:53:42.706
- Why not? - What did you order?

1499
00:53:42.706 --> 00:53:43.906
Do I know you?

1500
00:53:44.465 --> 00:53:46.476
Narsha, how could you say that?

1501
00:53:46.476 --> 00:53:48.036
- I'm disappointed. - You're mean.

1502
00:53:48.136 --> 00:53:49.145
Come this way.

1503
00:53:49.346 --> 00:53:50.875
- Enjoy your lunch. - All right.

1504
00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:52.616
- Do you want to sit here? - You have water.

1505
00:53:52.616 --> 00:53:53.846
Have a seat.

1506
00:53:54.045 --> 00:53:55.116
- Go. - No, sit.

1507
00:53:55.445 --> 00:53:57.686
Have a seat. Come on.

1508
00:53:57.945 --> 00:53:58.985
Here.

1509
00:53:58.985 --> 00:54:01.156
- The view is nice here. - Hello.

1510
00:54:01.156 --> 00:54:03.186
- Hi. - Are you here to eat?

1511
00:54:03.186 --> 00:54:04.386
I'm your waiter for the day.

1512
00:54:04.485 --> 00:54:06.826
Please get our food then. Our ticket number is two.

1513
00:54:07.056 --> 00:54:08.656
- Get it for us. - Give me your receipt.

1514
00:54:08.656 --> 00:54:09.666
All right.

1515
00:54:09.965 --> 00:54:12.166
Excuse me, we need kimchi and chopsticks.

1516
00:54:12.226 --> 00:54:13.266
What do you need?

1517
00:54:13.366 --> 00:54:15.335
- Spoons and chopsticks. - All right.

1518
00:54:15.335 --> 00:54:16.965
- Some kimchi too. - Okay.

1519
00:54:16.965 --> 00:54:18.136
(I'll give up my pride for food.)

1520
00:54:18.235 --> 00:54:20.275
Don't you drink coffee from convenience stores?

1521
00:54:20.275 --> 00:54:21.306
(Tasting)

1522
00:54:22.846 --> 00:54:24.645
- Is something inside? - What is this?

1523
00:54:25.775 --> 00:54:27.215
(Puzzled)

1524
00:54:29.186 --> 00:54:30.315
(What is it?)

1525
00:54:31.315 --> 00:54:32.686
I think I taste...

1526
00:54:33.456 --> 00:54:34.556
some syrup.

1527
00:54:37.956 --> 00:54:39.326
(Is that for yourself?)

1528
00:54:39.326 --> 00:54:40.395
No, it's for others.

1529
00:54:41.755 --> 00:54:43.625
You're out of line here.

1530
00:54:44.025 --> 00:54:45.366
I can't help you now.

1531
00:54:45.596 --> 00:54:47.835
I was going to give you a dollar,

1532
00:54:48.465 --> 00:54:50.235
but you gave me syrup.

1533
00:54:50.605 --> 00:54:51.605
I'm coming.

1534
00:54:52.835 --> 00:54:53.875
I don't think we can eat.

1535
00:54:54.235 --> 00:54:55.906
I think you're right.

1536
00:54:56.445 --> 00:54:58.045
We've burned a lot of calories.

1537
00:54:59.045 --> 00:55:00.645
Why don't we just take their food?

1538
00:55:01.675 --> 00:55:03.045
Let's just go.

1539
00:55:03.585 --> 00:55:05.145
Let's eat it in the car.

1540
00:55:05.145 --> 00:55:06.156
Okay.

1541
00:55:06.715 --> 00:55:09.326
We have to act naturally. You know that, right?

1542
00:55:09.956 --> 00:55:11.355
Thank you.

1543
00:55:11.355 --> 00:55:13.226
Please enjoy.

1544
00:55:13.496 --> 00:55:14.695
Thank you.

1545
00:55:14.695 --> 00:55:15.965
Just walk naturally.

1546
00:55:16.226 --> 00:55:17.766
(They're not looking back.)

1547
00:55:18.826 --> 00:55:19.866
We're here.

1548
00:55:20.936 --> 00:55:21.936
Defconn.

1549
00:55:22.605 --> 00:55:25.306
Dong Gu saw us. He saw us.

1550
00:55:26.976 --> 00:55:28.175
(Where are they going?)

1551
00:55:29.445 --> 00:55:32.576
I'm scared. I heard him call my name.

1552
00:55:32.576 --> 00:55:33.576
(He'll get them in no time.)

1553
00:55:33.576 --> 00:55:35.016
Where should we go?

1554
00:55:35.686 --> 00:55:37.246
(The tricksters settle down in a corner.)

1555
00:55:39.585 --> 00:55:41.886
(She cuts tonkatsu with a spoon.)

1556
00:55:41.886 --> 00:55:43.855
I forgot to bring a knife.

1557
00:55:43.855 --> 00:55:46.755
Shouldn't we at least get paid for the delivery?

1558
00:55:46.755 --> 00:55:47.755
We should.

1559
00:55:47.755 --> 00:55:49.295
(The owner of the food goes looking for them.)

1560
00:55:49.826 --> 00:55:53.096
Let's eat this part and hide it like this.

1561
00:55:54.136 --> 00:55:55.735
Just put them together.

1562
00:55:56.835 --> 00:55:59.275
We deserve to eat this much.

1563
00:55:59.976 --> 00:56:02.076
- It's just one piece. - I felt too bad to eat,

1564
00:56:02.076 --> 00:56:03.076
but I think this is okay.

1565
00:56:04.346 --> 00:56:05.875
What? That's ours!

1566
00:56:06.516 --> 00:56:08.045
What? That's ours!

1567
00:56:08.275 --> 00:56:09.886
What are you doing? I knew it!

1568
00:56:09.886 --> 00:56:10.886
We were going to bring it to you.

1569
00:56:10.886 --> 00:56:12.815
- We were just cutting it. - What's going on?

1570
00:56:12.815 --> 00:56:14.715
- We were cutting it. - No!

1571
00:56:14.715 --> 00:56:17.485
- I said no! No! - I cut it for you.

1572
00:56:17.556 --> 00:56:19.656
- Stop it! - All right. Let's go.

1573
00:56:19.656 --> 00:56:21.695
No. You can't do this.

1574
00:56:21.695 --> 00:56:22.925
(It's delicious.)

1575
00:56:23.795 --> 00:56:25.465
Don't we deserve to eat it?

1576
00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:27.065
I can't believe you guys.

1577
00:56:29.206 --> 00:56:30.465
I shouldn't have trusted you.

1578
00:56:30.465 --> 00:56:32.505
- There was no knife. - You tricked us.

1579
00:56:32.505 --> 00:56:33.576
They didn't give you a knife.

1580
00:56:33.576 --> 00:56:34.576
How could you take our food?

1581
00:56:34.835 --> 00:56:35.846
We wanted to cut it for you.

1582
00:56:36.406 --> 00:56:37.445
Here is your food delivery.

1583
00:56:37.445 --> 00:56:38.675
- Okay. - Here is your food.

1584
00:56:38.675 --> 00:56:40.215
- Is this ours? - We brought your food.

1585
00:56:40.215 --> 00:56:41.775
- It's ours. - You still have money.

1586
00:56:41.775 --> 00:56:43.215
- You can't do this to us. - What's this?

1587
00:56:43.945 --> 00:56:45.686
They already ate some.

1588
00:56:45.686 --> 00:56:46.815
- Where? - Here.

1589
00:56:47.456 --> 00:56:49.156
They were eating it over there.

1590
00:56:49.255 --> 00:56:51.355
- Oh, my. - Really? Our food?

1591
00:56:51.625 --> 00:56:53.255
That's why they disappeared.

1592
00:56:54.226 --> 00:56:55.666
Thank you for the food.

1593
00:56:55.666 --> 00:56:56.766
Thank you, Gyeong Ree.

1594
00:56:56.766 --> 00:56:58.496
Thank you.

1595
00:56:59.195 --> 00:57:01.496
- Gosh. - Hello.

1596
00:57:05.366 --> 00:57:07.105
Gosh, how did he catch us?

1597
00:57:08.436 --> 00:57:10.476
- We brought you water. - You're praying.

1598
00:57:10.476 --> 00:57:11.476
I hope you'll enjoy it.

1599
00:57:11.476 --> 00:57:12.815
Do you want rice?

1600
00:57:13.445 --> 00:57:15.585
If you would give me, I'll take it.

1601
00:57:16.045 --> 00:57:17.485
Thank you.

1602
00:57:17.585 --> 00:57:19.386
Don't give him too much. It'll spoil him.

1603
00:57:19.585 --> 00:57:22.925
All right. You don't have to give me a lot of it.

1604
00:57:22.985 --> 00:57:25.255
- Goodness. - Oh, my. Tae Hyun.

1605
00:57:25.255 --> 00:57:26.456
Honey, go and take it.

1606
00:57:26.456 --> 00:57:27.826
- This is for Yu Ra. - Is it?

1607
00:57:28.255 --> 00:57:29.925
- Thank you. - Sure.

1608
00:57:30.195 --> 00:57:31.596
- Is that soybean stew? - Yes.

1609
00:57:32.335 --> 00:57:34.036
- We tried too hard. - I know.

1610
00:57:34.036 --> 00:57:35.295
We shouldn't have.

1611
00:57:35.295 --> 00:57:37.206
My gosh, Shin Young.

1612
00:57:37.636 --> 00:57:39.036
(She takes Yu Ra's jjajangmyeon.)

1613
00:57:39.375 --> 00:57:40.976
Put that down.

1614
00:57:40.976 --> 00:57:42.576
Yu Ra, she took your food.

1615
00:57:42.576 --> 00:57:43.945
You saw it?

1616
00:57:43.945 --> 00:57:45.916
Please guard your food well.

1617
00:57:46.375 --> 00:57:47.675
Guard your food.

1618
00:57:47.976 --> 00:57:49.815
- We might take it all. - Oh, it was jjajangmyeon.

1619
00:57:50.085 --> 00:57:52.456
Be careful. Things happen in a second around here.

1620
00:57:54.156 --> 00:57:55.485
I feel so bad.

1621
00:57:55.886 --> 00:57:57.726
If you do, give me some food.

1622
00:57:58.386 --> 00:57:59.695
Here is your ramyeon.

1623
00:57:59.695 --> 00:58:00.695
That's not yours.

1624
00:58:00.695 --> 00:58:02.425
It is. That's Joon Ho's.

1625
00:58:02.425 --> 00:58:04.496
- Please enjoy. - Thank you.

1626
00:58:04.496 --> 00:58:06.436
Gosh, you look more handsome in person.

1627
00:58:06.436 --> 00:58:07.436
Thank you.

1628
00:58:07.565 --> 00:58:09.366
Ma'am, here you go.

1629
00:58:10.136 --> 00:58:11.136
I should take some kimchi.

1630
00:58:11.936 --> 00:58:13.605
Here is your ramyeon.

1631
00:58:13.875 --> 00:58:15.976
We got an order of ramyeon with rice cake too.

1632
00:58:16.175 --> 00:58:18.945
(Joon Ho and Narsha's ramyeon is finally ready.)

1633
00:58:18.945 --> 00:58:19.945
(Glancing)

1634
00:58:21.715 --> 00:58:22.786
(I have a bad feeling.)

1635
00:58:22.786 --> 00:58:24.485
- I think I should go. - Please do.

1636
00:58:24.485 --> 00:58:26.485
- He might do something. - I'll be here.

1637
00:58:27.456 --> 00:58:28.456
Joon Young.

1638
00:58:30.425 --> 00:58:32.355
(He does look suspicious.)

1639
00:58:33.096 --> 00:58:34.125
Whose food is that?

1640
00:58:34.456 --> 00:58:35.766
(They bumped into each other.)

1641
00:58:35.866 --> 00:58:37.425
I was just worried.

1642
00:58:37.425 --> 00:58:38.766
- It's ours, right? - Yes.

1643
00:58:38.766 --> 00:58:40.335
All right. I just wanted to check.

1644
00:58:40.866 --> 00:58:43.936
Be careful. We'll be sitting over there.

1645
00:58:43.936 --> 00:58:46.175
Hey. You brat!

1646
00:58:48.076 --> 00:58:51.045
Hey. You'll be in trouble for this.

1647
00:58:51.775 --> 00:58:53.875
Hey. What do I do?

1648
00:58:54.775 --> 00:58:56.016
What do you mean?

1649
00:58:56.686 --> 00:58:58.116
You're so mean.

1650
00:58:58.246 --> 00:58:59.916
Gosh, he came to check.

1651
00:59:00.286 --> 00:59:03.726
Here are some toothpicks for you.

1652
00:59:04.355 --> 00:59:06.025
You'll need to pick your teeth.

1653
00:59:06.755 --> 00:59:09.525
Don't you think we'll be split into teams of three?

1654
00:59:09.596 --> 00:59:11.366
Shin Young and I are the strong ones.

1655
00:59:11.666 --> 00:59:13.166
- We're incredibly strong. - Yes.

1656
00:59:13.266 --> 00:59:14.795
Do you want some jjajangmyeon?

1657
00:59:15.235 --> 00:59:17.605
- Gosh. - Give some to Shin Young.

1658
00:59:17.666 --> 00:59:19.076
- You two... - It's for the delivery.

1659
00:59:19.076 --> 00:59:20.675
did work hard.

1660
00:59:20.835 --> 00:59:21.835
Let's share it.

1661
00:59:21.835 --> 00:59:23.576
I don't know what to do.

1662
00:59:23.675 --> 00:59:25.306
- I feel so bad. - Don't feel pressured.

1663
00:59:25.306 --> 00:59:27.275
No, just enjoy your meal.

1664
00:59:27.275 --> 00:59:28.375
(He smacks his lips.)

1665
00:59:29.286 --> 00:59:31.416
(The poor ones share what they have.)

1666
00:59:31.416 --> 00:59:33.416
Can't you get anything from Jong Min and Ha Ra?

1667
00:59:33.456 --> 00:59:34.786
Gosh, they're petty.

1668
00:59:34.786 --> 00:59:36.726
Actually, Jong Min and I...

1669
00:59:36.726 --> 00:59:39.956
often get bullied on the show.

1670
00:59:39.956 --> 00:59:41.596
I guess it's for the show.

1671
00:59:41.596 --> 00:59:44.766
That's why the four of us should team up in secret.

1672
00:59:44.766 --> 00:59:47.366
The important thing is I think we would...

1673
00:59:48.235 --> 00:59:49.766
be better at things.

1674
00:59:49.866 --> 00:59:51.666
I mean these two.

1675
00:59:51.866 --> 00:59:54.675
I think we're stronger...

1676
00:59:54.675 --> 00:59:55.775
- than them. - You're right.

1677
00:59:55.775 --> 00:59:57.275
Ha Ra can run really fast.

1678
00:59:57.875 --> 00:59:59.175
They're fast and strong. That's it.

1679
00:59:59.175 --> 01:00:00.315
- We'll win. - She's strong too.

1680
01:00:00.315 --> 01:00:02.616
I also handled Jong Min's money.

1681
01:00:02.616 --> 01:00:04.516
- Did you? - She said...

1682
01:00:04.516 --> 01:00:06.485
women should handle money.

1683
01:00:06.585 --> 01:00:08.286
I think we're better than them.

1684
01:00:11.656 --> 01:00:12.826
Would you like some?

1685
01:00:13.025 --> 01:00:14.656
- Thank you. - Really?

1686
01:00:14.656 --> 01:00:15.866
The others gave us food.

1687
01:00:15.866 --> 01:00:18.125
- Gosh, you're so nice. - The others gave us food.

1688
01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:19.596
- Here you go. - It's so hot in here.

1689
01:00:19.596 --> 01:00:22.335
The original members are certainly nicer.

1690
01:00:23.235 --> 01:00:24.465
Why are you hiding the rice?

1691
01:00:25.105 --> 01:00:26.206
We won't steal it, Jong Min.

1692
01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.206
We won't steal any.

1693
01:00:28.036 --> 01:00:29.445
You should go now.

1694
01:00:29.675 --> 01:00:30.875
I already gave you ramyeon.

1695
01:00:31.045 --> 01:00:32.846
Are you telling us to leave?

1696
01:00:33.275 --> 01:00:34.976
Do you have any soup left?

1697
01:00:35.145 --> 01:00:36.215
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1698
01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:38.786
- Bye. - If you buy me rice...

1699
01:00:38.786 --> 01:00:40.886
with a dollar, I'll give you half with soup.

1700
01:00:41.656 --> 01:00:43.025
It's worth it.

1701
01:00:43.656 --> 01:00:45.386
Go to Korean food section.

1702
01:00:46.996 --> 01:00:49.065
(He's excited to eat.)

1703
01:00:49.895 --> 01:00:51.465
I can do chores for you.

1704
01:00:51.766 --> 01:00:52.835
Do you want some coffee?

1705
01:00:53.266 --> 01:00:54.835
- Yes. - Give me money.

1706
01:00:55.036 --> 01:00:57.235
We want iced coffee. They want hot coffee.

1707
01:00:57.306 --> 01:00:58.806
- Two hot coffee? - Coffee please.

1708
01:00:58.806 --> 01:01:00.936
Two from the vending machine please.

1709
01:01:00.936 --> 01:01:01.936
From the vending machine?

1710
01:01:01.936 --> 01:01:04.645
What will you do if you run away?

1711
01:01:04.645 --> 01:01:06.476
- We won't cheat. - You'll be unlucky...

1712
01:01:06.476 --> 01:01:07.516
for three years.

1713
01:01:07.616 --> 01:01:09.945
- You want black coffee? - Here's some soup.

1714
01:01:09.945 --> 01:01:12.215
Give me one more dollar to buy ice, Joon Ho.

1715
01:01:12.956 --> 01:01:14.186
- That's enough. - Okay.

1716
01:01:14.186 --> 01:01:15.656
- Coffee is 50 cents. - Thank you.

1717
01:01:15.656 --> 01:01:18.425
Joon Young, here's some ramyeon.

1718
01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:20.025
- I have some food. - Where's the receipt?

1719
01:01:20.025 --> 01:01:21.156
I feel bad for you.

1720
01:01:21.726 --> 01:01:22.895
It's exact.

1721
01:01:22.996 --> 01:01:24.795
- I'll pay you back. - Okay.

1722
01:01:24.795 --> 01:01:25.895
Here you go.

1723
01:01:25.895 --> 01:01:28.866
We gave them a lot. We usually don't give any.

1724
01:01:28.866 --> 01:01:30.266
- Seriously. - Really?

1725
01:01:30.465 --> 01:01:32.505
(This is good enough.)

1726
01:01:34.706 --> 01:01:35.875
- You know, right? - It was delicious.

1727
01:01:36.406 --> 01:01:38.005
The loser has to clean up.

1728
01:01:38.005 --> 01:01:39.976
Is that so?

1729
01:01:39.976 --> 01:01:41.976
I haven't done it since high school.

1730
01:01:42.846 --> 01:01:44.045
The loser will clean up.

1731
01:01:44.045 --> 01:01:45.116
(One loser cleans up.)

1732
01:01:45.116 --> 01:01:47.416
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1733
01:01:49.826 --> 01:01:50.826
We won.

1734
01:01:51.686 --> 01:01:53.395
Did you plan it?

1735
01:01:53.395 --> 01:01:54.525
Thank you for the food.

1736
01:01:54.525 --> 01:01:56.726
Was that intentional? Did you give them a sign?

1737
01:01:56.726 --> 01:01:59.366
- Let's get fresh air. - Let's drink coffee.

1738
01:01:59.366 --> 01:02:00.996
Tell me if you planned it or not.

1739
01:02:00.996 --> 01:02:03.436
We don't cheat. We didn't plan it.

1740
01:02:03.436 --> 01:02:04.806
- You didn't? - I'll help you.

1741
01:02:04.806 --> 01:02:05.875
(He tries to pay back.)

1742
01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:07.835
- I don't have any money. - What?

1743
01:02:07.835 --> 01:02:09.206
- I have no money. - Gosh.

1744
01:02:09.206 --> 01:02:10.445
(He changes his mind.)

1745
01:02:11.675 --> 01:02:12.846
- Here you go. - Defconn.

1746
01:02:13.016 --> 01:02:14.045
- What? - It's nothing.

1747
01:02:14.346 --> 01:02:15.616
- Here. - What is it?

1748
01:02:15.616 --> 01:02:17.116
Pour some to make iced coffee.

1749
01:02:17.416 --> 01:02:19.786
I bought two cups.

1750
01:02:19.786 --> 01:02:21.516
I'll add water in one.

1751
01:02:21.815 --> 01:02:23.985
(She puts it into action.)

1752
01:02:24.186 --> 01:02:25.826
May I get some hot water?

1753
01:02:26.456 --> 01:02:27.755
(She gets some hot water.)

1754
01:02:30.465 --> 01:02:31.666
(He looks around.)

1755
01:02:33.335 --> 01:02:37.235
(He increases the amount of coffee.)

1756
01:02:38.206 --> 01:02:40.476
I made 2 cups of coffee with 1.

1757
01:02:41.235 --> 01:02:43.675
- That's right. - How much do you gain?

1758
01:02:43.675 --> 01:02:46.045
- A dollar. - 40 cents.

1759
01:02:46.045 --> 01:02:47.346
- You gain 1.4 dollars. - Right.

1760
01:02:47.746 --> 01:02:50.045
- Where's the coffee? - Here it is.

1761
01:02:50.045 --> 01:02:51.846
- Give us coffee. - Okay.

1762
01:02:51.846 --> 01:02:53.315
- I'm sorry. - Here it is.

1763
01:02:53.315 --> 01:02:54.916
I'm sorry for being late.

1764
01:02:54.916 --> 01:02:56.525
- What is it? - It's coffee.

1765
01:02:56.525 --> 01:02:57.686
The color is strange.

1766
01:02:57.686 --> 01:03:00.096
It's what you get from the vending machine.

1767
01:03:00.096 --> 01:03:02.125
- Coffee is here. - That's right.

1768
01:03:03.025 --> 01:03:04.025
- It's iced coffee. - Seriously.

1769
01:03:04.395 --> 01:03:06.465
- Give me delivery fee. - Let me look.

1770
01:03:06.465 --> 01:03:07.536
Take a look.

1771
01:03:07.536 --> 01:03:08.766
(He's confident.)

1772
01:03:09.065 --> 01:03:11.206
- Where did you get ice? - I bought it.

1773
01:03:11.206 --> 01:03:13.275
It tastes too light.

1774
01:03:14.275 --> 01:03:15.875
- What do you mean? - It's too light.

1775
01:03:16.346 --> 01:03:17.645
See it for yourself.

1776
01:03:17.645 --> 01:03:19.916
- Get it from the machine. - It's Americano.

1777
01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:21.576
- It's Americano. - It's usually this light.

1778
01:03:22.145 --> 01:03:23.186
Try it.

1779
01:03:23.186 --> 01:03:26.255
- Are you tricking us? - Why would we?

1780
01:03:27.056 --> 01:03:28.985
- That's the worst. - We worked hard.

1781
01:03:28.985 --> 01:03:30.056
- It's iced coffee. - I worked very hard.

1782
01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:32.295
- It's delicious. - It tastes okay.

1783
01:03:32.826 --> 01:03:35.625
- We worked really hard. - You said you'd pay us.

1784
01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:37.695
What's wrong with him? It's only a dollar.

1785
01:03:37.695 --> 01:03:40.096
- Please clean this up. - Okay.

1786
01:03:40.096 --> 01:03:41.166
Here we go.

1787
01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:42.706
All right.

1788
01:03:43.136 --> 01:03:45.976
Excuse me.

1789
01:03:46.235 --> 01:03:49.045
Please treat me well during the game.

1790
01:03:49.045 --> 01:03:50.076
Okay.

1791
01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.076
- She's the MC. - I'll give you advantage.

1792
01:03:52.076 --> 01:03:53.116
- Right. - Okay.

1793
01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:54.545
What will be the password?

1794
01:03:54.545 --> 01:03:55.585
(He takes it quickly.)

1795
01:03:55.585 --> 01:03:56.585
What...

1796
01:03:57.145 --> 01:03:58.215
Thank you.

1797
01:03:58.616 --> 01:04:01.056
- It's toothpick. - Password is toothpick.

1798
01:04:01.056 --> 01:04:03.386
- They have great service. - If I say toothpick...

1799
01:04:03.386 --> 01:04:04.425
Okay.

1800
01:04:04.425 --> 01:04:06.695
- They have great service. - I agree.

1801
01:04:07.295 --> 01:04:10.525
(He begs for money as he gives out toothpicks.)

1802
01:04:10.525 --> 01:04:11.795
Goodness.

1803
01:04:11.795 --> 01:04:13.666
Thank you for your kindness.

1804
01:04:13.666 --> 01:04:15.465
I'll take 50 cents.

1805
01:04:15.666 --> 01:04:17.266
Thank you.

1806
01:04:17.266 --> 01:04:19.206
It's 40 cents. Do you have 60 cents?

1807
01:04:20.005 --> 01:04:21.375
- What shall we eat? - Have a fish cake.

1808
01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:22.406
- A fish cake stick? - My stomach hurts.

1809
01:04:22.406 --> 01:04:23.406
(They have some hope.)

1810
01:04:23.406 --> 01:04:25.346
- How about a hot dog? - Eat a hot dog.

1811
01:04:25.346 --> 01:04:26.846
May I get a fish cake stick?

1812
01:04:27.275 --> 01:04:29.085
- 3, 2. - Thank you.

1813
01:04:30.045 --> 01:04:32.886
- This was very hard. - We had no choice.

1814
01:04:32.886 --> 01:04:34.916
- Here I go. - Take a big bite.

1815
01:04:35.686 --> 01:04:38.125
(This is...)

1816
01:04:38.556 --> 01:04:40.096
(This is happiness.)

1817
01:04:40.395 --> 01:04:41.695
(It's delicious.)

1818
01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:43.695
I don't want it.

1819
01:04:44.826 --> 01:04:46.166
1, 2, 3.

1820
01:04:46.335 --> 01:04:47.395
She's the youngest.

1821
01:04:47.395 --> 01:04:48.465
Jong Min had a physical contact.

1822
01:04:48.565 --> 01:04:51.166
Why are you laughing? It's gross.

1823
01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:52.235
It's gross.

1824
01:04:53.175 --> 01:04:54.306
What do you mean?

1825
01:04:54.636 --> 01:04:55.976
She said it's gross.

1826
01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:56.976
What's wrong with you?

1827
01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:58.976
Jong Min, control yourself.

1828
01:04:58.976 --> 01:05:01.076
Control myself? What did I do?

1829
01:05:01.275 --> 01:05:02.516
All I did was smile.

1830
01:05:02.516 --> 01:05:04.916
What made her say that it's gross?

1831
01:05:04.916 --> 01:05:06.616
- Stop it. - I just smiled.

1832
01:05:06.786 --> 01:05:10.085
I still remember Ha Ra at "Celebrity Boxing Game".

1833
01:05:10.826 --> 01:05:13.425
There's a clip of her punching.

1834
01:05:13.695 --> 01:05:14.726
I remember that.

1835
01:05:14.726 --> 01:05:16.195
(They're fierce fighters.)

1836
01:05:19.266 --> 01:05:21.996
She threw her punch while looking at the eyes.

1837
01:05:21.996 --> 01:05:23.636
Ha Ra hates losing.

1838
01:05:23.636 --> 01:05:25.906
She's very competitive.

1839
01:05:25.906 --> 01:05:27.036
I'm like that too.

1840
01:05:27.536 --> 01:05:30.145
Does my partner work at "Music Bank" all day?

1841
01:05:30.145 --> 01:05:31.605
Let's go to "Music Bank" today.

1842
01:05:31.706 --> 01:05:34.875
- As guests? - What if I arrive...

1843
01:05:35.076 --> 01:05:37.346
- If she doesn't know you? - She might not know...

1844
01:05:37.346 --> 01:05:38.386
my name.

1845
01:05:39.085 --> 01:05:40.985
- Goodness. - Sun Mi.

1846
01:05:42.255 --> 01:05:43.485
Did she make a comeback recently?

1847
01:05:44.085 --> 01:05:45.755
- GFriend is invited. - Who are invited?

1848
01:05:45.755 --> 01:05:47.255
- GFriend? - DIA.

1849
01:05:47.255 --> 01:05:49.766
- NCT. - Isn't that a male group?

1850
01:05:50.625 --> 01:05:54.695
Did we say that his partner is female?

1851
01:05:55.605 --> 01:05:57.266
I don't think we did.

1852
01:05:57.266 --> 01:05:58.636
Samuel is another guest.

1853
01:05:59.235 --> 01:06:01.775
I have no idea about these female groups.

1854
01:06:02.036 --> 01:06:03.645
Can you recognize who they are...

1855
01:06:03.645 --> 01:06:04.775
- Not at all. - with their names?

1856
01:06:04.775 --> 01:06:07.275
- I know up to this group. - Who?

1857
01:06:07.275 --> 01:06:08.315
S.E.S.

1858
01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.815
- Bada, Shoo, Eugene. - S.E.S?

1859
01:06:11.386 --> 01:06:13.186
I know Brown Eyed Girls.

1860
01:06:13.686 --> 01:06:17.686
He asked me how many are in Brian Girls.

1861
01:06:18.255 --> 01:06:19.295
Goodness.

1862
01:06:19.456 --> 01:06:21.895
He's my partner. He should take interest.

1863
01:06:23.425 --> 01:06:27.235
I hope "Invincible Youth" starts again.

1864
01:06:27.335 --> 01:06:28.835
There were many good programs in the past.

1865
01:06:29.335 --> 01:06:31.906
I wanted to be on "We Got Married" and "X-Men".

1866
01:06:31.906 --> 01:06:34.005
- Weren't you? - I did "We Got Married".

1867
01:06:34.005 --> 01:06:35.076
Who was your husband?

1868
01:06:35.076 --> 01:06:37.076
- It was Hong Jong Hyun. - Right.

1869
01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:38.406
Weren't you on it too?

1870
01:06:38.406 --> 01:06:39.416
- No. - Really?

1871
01:06:39.416 --> 01:06:40.746
Whom would you like?

1872
01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:43.085
What? Work on what?

1873
01:06:43.085 --> 01:06:44.886
With whom would you like to be on "We Got Married"?

1874
01:06:44.886 --> 01:06:47.315
It has to be a One Night Two Days member.

1875
01:06:47.315 --> 01:06:50.355
- What if we... - I wouldn't pick you.

1876
01:06:51.886 --> 01:06:52.925
(Embarrassed)

1877
01:06:52.925 --> 01:06:54.295
(I'm joking.)

1878
01:06:54.956 --> 01:06:56.295
What if you had to choose?

1879
01:06:56.295 --> 01:06:59.596
I'd like to work with Dong Gu.

1880
01:06:59.596 --> 01:07:01.465
She cares about appearance.

1881
01:07:01.465 --> 01:07:04.465
Didn't Dong Gu give a lecture?

1882
01:07:04.465 --> 01:07:05.735
At Ewha Womans University?

1883
01:07:06.175 --> 01:07:07.375
The destination is clear.

1884
01:07:07.406 --> 01:07:12.715
(He gave a moving speech at the university.)

1885
01:07:14.045 --> 01:07:15.045
Thank you.

1886
01:07:16.516 --> 01:07:19.085
- I was very impressed. - That lecture?

1887
01:07:19.585 --> 01:07:21.485
- It was strange. - It's better than you.

1888
01:07:21.485 --> 01:07:23.226
(What are you talking about?)

1889
01:07:23.226 --> 01:07:24.925
She doesn't like you at all.

1890
01:07:24.925 --> 01:07:26.695
(She'll never pick Jong Min.)

1891
01:07:26.795 --> 01:07:28.056
- Dong Gu is great, - I like him.

1892
01:07:28.056 --> 01:07:29.666
but he's promiscuous.

1893
01:07:30.996 --> 01:07:32.666
It's messy with women.

1894
01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:34.835
- It's a secret. - With relationships?

1895
01:07:35.666 --> 01:07:37.465
- Is it complicated? - Really?

1896
01:07:37.965 --> 01:07:40.175
Yu Ra, he's all over the world.

1897
01:07:40.936 --> 01:07:43.545
- All over the world? - It's international.

1898
01:07:43.545 --> 01:07:44.675
- International? - Really?

1899
01:07:44.675 --> 01:07:45.976
He can't have them if we can't.

1900
01:07:45.976 --> 01:07:47.215
(They spread a rumor without evidence.)

1901
01:07:48.215 --> 01:07:49.715
Let's make up a rumor.

1902
01:07:49.715 --> 01:07:50.746
(Men are silly.)

1903
01:07:50.846 --> 01:07:51.985
It's hard to know.

1904
01:07:53.016 --> 01:07:54.585
We're here.

1905
01:07:54.585 --> 01:07:57.056
- Really? - It's developed.

1906
01:07:57.255 --> 01:07:59.525
This isn't the place I used to know.

1907
01:07:59.525 --> 01:08:00.596
Has it changed?

1908
01:08:00.596 --> 01:08:03.395
- Greenhouse didn't exist. - It was just a field.

1909
01:08:03.395 --> 01:08:05.065
I drove...

1910
01:08:05.065 --> 01:08:07.695
- a tractor here. - That's right.

1911
01:08:07.695 --> 01:08:08.695
There were no houses.

1912
01:08:08.695 --> 01:08:11.266
Look at the paved road.

1913
01:08:11.266 --> 01:08:12.775
It used to be a dirt road.

1914
01:08:13.036 --> 01:08:15.945
Gosh, do you remember this place?

1915
01:08:15.945 --> 01:08:19.116
It must be strange to see all the changes.

1916
01:08:19.116 --> 01:08:21.145
I feel like I came back home.

1917
01:08:21.145 --> 01:08:23.445
That hasn't changed at all.

1918
01:08:23.445 --> 01:08:26.256
- You remember the trees? - I planted them.

1919
01:08:26.456 --> 01:08:28.616
- How about the bulldozer? - We put it there.

1920
01:08:29.426 --> 01:08:31.355
- You remember the boat? - Of course.

1921
01:08:31.355 --> 01:08:32.426
I used to ride it.

1922
01:08:32.725 --> 01:08:34.855
That was out of context.

1923
01:08:35.926 --> 01:08:37.126
How could you have done everything?

1924
01:08:37.695 --> 01:08:40.895
We did a lot of work here.

1925
01:08:41.095 --> 01:08:43.466
I can imagine how difficult it was.

1926
01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:45.735
It was really...

1927
01:08:45.735 --> 01:08:47.176
(They reminisce the past.)

1928
01:08:50.275 --> 01:08:52.076
Do you remember the stone?

1929
01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:55.176
I paved the road myself.

1930
01:08:55.176 --> 01:08:56.916
There are traces of time.

1931
01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:58.845
- What? - That's the house.

1932
01:08:59.685 --> 01:09:01.156
- Do you remember it? - It's here.

1933
01:09:01.156 --> 01:09:03.126
- It's this greenhouse. - Yes.

1934
01:09:03.126 --> 01:09:06.595
Look at the vines on top.

1935
01:09:07.256 --> 01:09:08.326
What was inside?

1936
01:09:08.326 --> 01:09:11.666
We gathered here to play games.

1937
01:09:11.666 --> 01:09:12.836
- There's a photo. - That picture...

1938
01:09:12.836 --> 01:09:13.935
- I remember. - reminds me.

1939
01:09:14.135 --> 01:09:16.105
- There's a photo. - It's a mural.

1940
01:09:16.105 --> 01:09:17.466
Look at that.

1941
01:09:17.565 --> 01:09:18.605
That's right.

1942
01:09:18.605 --> 01:09:20.376
("Invincible Youth")

1943
01:09:20.376 --> 01:09:21.906
- Who are they? - Gosh.

1944
01:09:21.906 --> 01:09:23.845
We look so young.

1945
01:09:23.845 --> 01:09:25.506
- Where's Narsha? - My goodness.

1946
01:09:25.506 --> 01:09:27.246
- I'm not in it. - Where's Narsha?

1947
01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:28.315
I'm not in it.

1948
01:09:28.315 --> 01:09:29.716
- Where's Narsha? - I'm not in it.

1949
01:09:29.716 --> 01:09:31.086
- She looks 30. - What?

1950
01:09:31.086 --> 01:09:32.116
You look better now.

1951
01:09:32.116 --> 01:09:33.756
I agree with you.

1952
01:09:33.756 --> 01:09:35.855
She looks much better now.

1953
01:09:35.855 --> 01:09:36.985
Where's Narsha?

1954
01:09:36.985 --> 01:09:38.055
- She's right here. - She's not.

1955
01:09:38.055 --> 01:09:40.256
There's Victoria as well.

1956
01:09:40.256 --> 01:09:42.565
Shin Young.

1957
01:09:42.565 --> 01:09:44.895
The photos faded in color during last seven years.

1958
01:09:44.895 --> 01:09:46.895
- Goodness. - That's impressive.

1959
01:09:46.895 --> 01:09:49.836
These were taken seven years ago.

1960
01:09:49.836 --> 01:09:51.206
The colors faded.

1961
01:09:51.206 --> 01:09:52.975
- Right. - What's this?

1962
01:09:52.975 --> 01:09:55.235
We were enthusiastic back then.

1963
01:09:56.406 --> 01:09:58.006
(Unforgettable friendships)

1964
01:09:58.006 --> 01:09:59.645
Gosh, look at that.

1965
01:10:00.246 --> 01:10:02.076
- We look so young. - We were young.

1966
01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:03.416
They look great.

1967
01:10:03.515 --> 01:10:05.985
(It was when they were young and innocent.)

1968
01:10:05.985 --> 01:10:08.355
We have a photo of Ha Ra's spirit.

1969
01:10:08.355 --> 01:10:09.456
My goodness.

1970
01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:11.355
- She looks like a ghost. - Here it is.

1971
01:10:12.525 --> 01:10:14.355
She does.

1972
01:10:14.355 --> 01:10:16.426
She was a great entertainer.

1973
01:10:16.426 --> 01:10:19.065
This isn't a photo exhibition.

1974
01:10:19.065 --> 01:10:20.635
It's like a memorial wall.

1975
01:10:20.635 --> 01:10:23.435
- Is she the owner? - Yes.

1976
01:10:24.006 --> 01:10:27.506
Take a picture and upload it on your group chat.

1977
01:10:27.935 --> 01:10:29.605
They will be so surprised.

1978
01:10:29.605 --> 01:10:31.046
- My gosh. - This is amazing.

1979
01:10:31.046 --> 01:10:32.345
- I'm scared. - Send it right away.

1980
01:10:32.345 --> 01:10:34.445
- You're way prettier now. - I think so too.

1981
01:10:34.445 --> 01:10:35.445
- Right? - Yes.

1982
01:10:35.645 --> 01:10:36.845
I look prettier now.

1983
01:10:36.845 --> 01:10:38.716
All of you haven't changed.

1984
01:10:38.716 --> 01:10:40.885
- We haven't? - No, you haven't.

1985
01:10:40.885 --> 01:10:43.086
I feel nostalgic.

1986
01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:45.695
Of course you do. It's been 8 years.

1987
01:10:45.695 --> 01:10:46.796
You're right.

1988
01:10:46.796 --> 01:10:48.126
- Hello. - Hello.

1989
01:10:48.126 --> 01:10:49.525
- Hello. - Hello.

1990
01:10:49.525 --> 01:10:50.595
- Hello. - Hello.

1991
01:10:50.626 --> 01:10:51.765
(They bump into some villagers.)

1992
01:10:51.765 --> 01:10:53.336
- Hello. - It's me, Shin Young.

1993
01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:55.635
Why have you become so skinny?

1994
01:10:56.605 --> 01:10:58.105
(She remembers her correctly.)

1995
01:10:58.105 --> 01:10:59.336
You're very honest.

1996
01:10:59.336 --> 01:11:01.975
Isn't this the totem pole that was on your show?

1997
01:11:01.975 --> 01:11:03.046
- Yes, it is. - Yes, it is.

1998
01:11:03.706 --> 01:11:05.546
You really did a lot of work.

1999
01:11:05.546 --> 01:11:07.345
(They arrive at the house of "Invincible Youth".)

2000
01:11:07.345 --> 01:11:09.815
- Is this your base camp? - It's on the top.

2001
01:11:09.815 --> 01:11:11.185
This is the house of "Invincible Youth".

2002
01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:14.815
There is a picture of the cow I mentioned earlier.

2003
01:11:14.985 --> 01:11:16.956
- It's so cute. - Is somebody living here?

2004
01:11:16.956 --> 01:11:17.956
It's really cute.

2005
01:11:17.956 --> 01:11:19.296
- Nobody is here. - It's a great artwork.

2006
01:11:19.296 --> 01:11:22.126
My goodness. I feel like crying.

2007
01:11:22.126 --> 01:11:23.525
Did you use to stay here?

2008
01:11:23.525 --> 01:11:25.126
I really feel like crying.

2009
01:11:25.126 --> 01:11:26.595
This place hasn't changed.

2010
01:11:26.595 --> 01:11:29.006
- People visited here. - Look at this.

2011
01:11:29.006 --> 01:11:30.805
- It feels nostalgic. - Who wrote this?

2012
01:11:31.336 --> 01:11:32.406
Someone wrote, "Narsha is a loser."

2013
01:11:32.406 --> 01:11:34.906
(The visitors left memos at the entrance.)

2014
01:11:36.546 --> 01:11:40.645
(The house is holding the old memories...)

2015
01:11:40.645 --> 01:11:45.515
(of "Invincible Youth".)

2016
01:11:48.385 --> 01:11:49.485
- Hey. - My goodness.

2017
01:11:49.485 --> 01:11:50.826
This is our postbox.

2018
01:11:52.055 --> 01:11:54.355
- Ha Ra is crying. - I'm not.

2019
01:11:54.656 --> 01:11:56.796
If we cry too, it will look weird, right?

2020
01:11:56.796 --> 01:11:59.565
- Why would you cry? - I'm not crying.

2021
01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.296
(They feel like they traveled back in time.)

2022
01:12:01.296 --> 01:12:02.666
- It's here. - This...

2023
01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:05.105
- That's our faucet. - Yes.

2024
01:12:05.105 --> 01:12:06.876
Yuchi and Chanran...

2025
01:12:07.105 --> 01:12:08.635
- The puppies. - By the way...

2026
01:12:08.635 --> 01:12:09.746
(It's been 7 years since they left the house.)

2027
01:12:11.305 --> 01:12:15.216
(While they are wallowing in nostalgia,)

2028
01:12:16.015 --> 01:12:19.086
(someone is watching them.)

2029
01:12:19.656 --> 01:12:23.025
The location here is amazing.

2030
01:12:23.126 --> 01:12:24.786
There will be a subway station behind this house.

2031
01:12:24.786 --> 01:12:26.195
- A subway station? - Yes.

2032
01:12:26.195 --> 01:12:27.796
- It's on line one. - Subway?

2033
01:12:27.796 --> 01:12:29.126
Gangwon subway line will be built here.

2034
01:12:29.126 --> 01:12:31.426
Does the train come from Cheongnyangni?

2035
01:12:31.426 --> 01:12:33.435
It takes only 45 minutes from Cheongnyangni.

2036
01:12:33.435 --> 01:12:35.765
- Are you certified? - Come on. You know me.

2037
01:12:37.206 --> 01:12:38.506
She's so funny.

2038
01:12:38.506 --> 01:12:39.836
My goodness.

2039
01:12:40.176 --> 01:12:42.206
- My gosh. - Trust me.

2040
01:12:42.206 --> 01:12:43.906
It really is a good location.

2041
01:12:43.906 --> 01:12:46.345
Ha Ra is the only one who wallows in nostalgia.

2042
01:12:46.345 --> 01:12:48.015
- Ha Ra. - She's totally lost.

2043
01:12:48.015 --> 01:12:49.485
She's lost in memories.

2044
01:12:52.416 --> 01:12:54.385
(The memories are everywhere in the house.)

2045
01:12:54.385 --> 01:12:55.555
Hello.

2046
01:12:56.555 --> 01:12:58.256
We built all this.

2047
01:12:59.225 --> 01:13:00.395
This one as well.

2048
01:13:01.796 --> 01:13:03.326
We built them ourselves.

2049
01:13:03.966 --> 01:13:05.735
There used to be a cow here as well.

2050
01:13:07.836 --> 01:13:10.836
Still, it seems to be well-preserved so far.

2051
01:13:11.435 --> 01:13:12.735
I'm happy about it.

2052
01:13:12.735 --> 01:13:14.935
It's been eight years since we left.

2053
01:13:16.746 --> 01:13:18.605
This place brings back the old memories.

2054
01:13:20.116 --> 01:13:22.445
(And...)

2055
01:13:24.445 --> 01:13:28.716
(the identity of the girl slowly gets revealed.)

2056
01:13:28.716 --> 01:13:32.626
(the identity of the girl slowly gets revealed.)

2057
01:13:35.595 --> 01:13:37.996
(She is coming.)

2058
01:13:37.996 --> 01:13:39.466
- Have a seat. - Let's sit.

2059
01:13:39.466 --> 01:13:40.536
It's...

2060
01:13:41.095 --> 01:13:42.605
- Look. - Why?

2061
01:13:42.605 --> 01:13:44.305
- My goodness. - Why?

2062
01:13:44.305 --> 01:13:45.406
- Hello. - Who is it?

2063
01:13:46.076 --> 01:13:47.406
- It's Chae Yeon. - Chae Yeon.

2064
01:13:47.975 --> 01:13:49.006
She's my partner.

2065
01:13:49.275 --> 01:13:51.206
(Jung Chae Yeon, a member of DIA)

2066
01:13:51.206 --> 01:13:53.345
- Your partner is here. - Finally.

2067
01:13:53.345 --> 01:13:54.645
It's your partner.

2068
01:13:54.645 --> 01:13:55.685
(Here's my partner.)

2069
01:13:55.685 --> 01:13:57.645
- You're my partner. - Let's pair up again.

2070
01:13:57.645 --> 01:14:00.315
- What do you mean? - No way.

2071
01:14:00.315 --> 01:14:03.985
Choose one whom you want to be your partner.

2072
01:14:03.985 --> 01:14:06.326
- What are you saying? - Turn around.

2073
01:14:06.326 --> 01:14:09.395
She's my partner! My goodness.

2074
01:14:09.395 --> 01:14:10.395
(They all line up in a row.)

2075
01:14:10.395 --> 01:14:11.966
She's my partner.

2076
01:14:12.666 --> 01:14:16.135
The one who answers her correctly will be chosen.

2077
01:14:16.135 --> 01:14:17.735
Ask them one question.

2078
01:14:17.735 --> 01:14:20.076
- Which group am I in? - Calendar!

2079
01:14:20.406 --> 01:14:22.845
- What? - That's wrong.

2080
01:14:22.845 --> 01:14:24.706
- Calendar. - It's not "Calendar".

2081
01:14:24.706 --> 01:14:26.475
- It's DIA. - You said "Calendar".

2082
01:14:26.475 --> 01:14:29.246
I didn't say "Calendar". I said "DIA".

2083
01:14:29.246 --> 01:14:30.786
(Let's hear it again.)

2084
01:14:30.786 --> 01:14:32.046
(He said it correctly, but the majority says not.)

2085
01:14:32.046 --> 01:14:33.416
- You said "Calendar". - "Calendar" is wrong.

2086
01:14:33.416 --> 01:14:35.315
- It's "DIA". - "Calendar" is wrong.

2087
01:14:35.315 --> 01:14:37.786
Make it into a multiple choice quiz.

2088
01:14:37.786 --> 01:14:39.756
It's a multiple choice quiz. Tell us the number.

2089
01:14:39.756 --> 01:14:41.496
- Tell us the number. - Number seven. DIA.

2090
01:14:41.496 --> 01:14:43.095
- Number seven is not DIA. - Me!

2091
01:14:43.095 --> 01:14:44.525
I know the answer!

2092
01:14:44.525 --> 01:14:45.996
- I know the answer! - Yes?

2093
01:14:45.996 --> 01:14:47.466
(I know the answer!)

2094
01:14:47.466 --> 01:14:49.206
DIA!

2095
01:14:49.206 --> 01:14:50.836
- Which number? - Say the number.

2096
01:14:50.836 --> 01:14:52.166
- You're out. - I know the answer.

2097
01:14:52.166 --> 01:14:53.635
You idiot. It's now a multiple choice quiz.

2098
01:14:53.635 --> 01:14:55.336
A half carat diamond.

2099
01:14:55.336 --> 01:14:57.275
A half carat diamond is expensive. You're out.

2100
01:14:58.746 --> 01:15:00.345
Let's start over.

2101
01:15:00.345 --> 01:15:01.345
(Chae Yeon's quiz restarts.)

2102
01:15:01.345 --> 01:15:02.945
Please ask us a question precisely.

2103
01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:06.015
How many members does my group have?

2104
01:15:06.015 --> 01:15:08.055
- I know. - Joon Ho.

2105
01:15:08.055 --> 01:15:09.185
- Joon Ho. - Joon Ho.

2106
01:15:09.185 --> 01:15:10.855
- I checked it earlier. - Go on.

2107
01:15:12.156 --> 01:15:13.656
- Six. - Incorrect!

2108
01:15:13.656 --> 01:15:16.326
- I know. - Joon Young.

2109
01:15:17.265 --> 01:15:19.395
Nine.

2110
01:15:19.395 --> 01:15:21.235
- Goodness. - I know! 10!

2111
01:15:21.235 --> 01:15:23.765
Tell us where you live before you say the answer.

2112
01:15:23.765 --> 01:15:25.406
- Did you say 9? - 10.

2113
01:15:25.406 --> 01:15:26.805
- Where do you live? - Ichon-dong.

2114
01:15:26.805 --> 01:15:27.975
- Nonhyeon-dong. - He just searched it.

2115
01:15:27.975 --> 01:15:29.076
- Ichon-dong. - Ichon-dong?

2116
01:15:29.076 --> 01:15:32.376
- 11. - 11? The answer is...

2117
01:15:32.775 --> 01:15:34.576
(The answer is...)

2118
01:15:35.586 --> 01:15:37.345
Joon Young guessed it correctly! It's nine!

2119
01:15:37.345 --> 01:15:39.055
- I was right? - Yes.

2120
01:15:39.185 --> 01:15:40.815
Narsha, you said those were back-up dancers!

2121
01:15:41.256 --> 01:15:43.286
You said the girls in the back are back-up dancers!

2122
01:15:43.286 --> 01:15:44.485
There are so many members?

2123
01:15:44.485 --> 01:15:46.796
She said the girls in the back were dancers.

2124
01:15:47.395 --> 01:15:49.966
- My gosh, Narsha. - What was your answer?

2125
01:15:49.966 --> 01:15:51.725
- He was watching a video. - At first,

2126
01:15:51.725 --> 01:15:54.135
I said it looked like they are nine.

2127
01:15:54.135 --> 01:15:56.435
And she said four of them were back-up dancers.

2128
01:15:56.706 --> 01:15:59.475
I said 5 because there were 5 in the front.

2129
01:15:59.475 --> 01:16:01.805
There's no point of doing this quiz.

2130
01:16:01.805 --> 01:16:03.546
Many of us already know the answer.

2131
01:16:03.945 --> 01:16:05.945
Joon Young turns out to be her partner anyway.

2132
01:16:05.945 --> 01:16:08.176
She's supposed to be my partner.

2133
01:16:08.985 --> 01:16:11.185
(Then rank us at least.)

2134
01:16:11.185 --> 01:16:13.086
Why do you talk so rudely?

2135
01:16:13.086 --> 01:16:15.685
Shin Young, please rank us.

2136
01:16:15.685 --> 01:16:18.626
- Now we're all paired up. - They're betrayers.

2137
01:16:18.626 --> 01:16:20.156
See? They're betrayers.

2138
01:16:20.156 --> 01:16:21.626
- Rank all six of us. - Really?

2139
01:16:21.626 --> 01:16:24.525
Shin Young, I'll get going.

2140
01:16:24.525 --> 01:16:26.996
- I... - Are you going already?

2141
01:16:27.735 --> 01:16:29.336
He doesn't want her to go home.

2142
01:16:29.336 --> 01:16:31.635
Please open the door for her.

2143
01:16:31.735 --> 01:16:33.376
I hate people like him.

2144
01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:35.605
Could you please take off the crown?

2145
01:16:35.605 --> 01:16:37.906
We'll rank you by our preference.

2146
01:16:37.906 --> 01:16:40.015
- Let's go for it. - Preference ranking.

2147
01:16:40.015 --> 01:16:42.546
- Preference ranking. - I'm suddenly excited.

2148
01:16:43.515 --> 01:16:45.546
- It's hot. - Chae Yeon is here.

2149
01:16:45.546 --> 01:16:47.156
- Take some rest. - Don't push yourself.

2150
01:16:47.156 --> 01:16:49.426
- Why? - Yu Ra, go see a doctor.

2151
01:16:49.426 --> 01:16:51.055
- Gu Ra, it's hot, so... - Did you say Gu Ra?

2152
01:16:51.055 --> 01:16:53.055
- Gu Ra? - It's Koo Ha Ra.

2153
01:16:53.055 --> 01:16:55.926
- Gu Ra? - That's not her name.

2154
01:16:55.926 --> 01:16:58.166
- Hey, Gu Ra. - Step aside.

2155
01:16:58.166 --> 01:17:00.796
We have the result of the preference survey.

2156
01:17:00.796 --> 01:17:01.895
- Okay. - Already?

2157
01:17:02.605 --> 01:17:03.735
I hope I win fourth place at least.

2158
01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:06.536
I'm sorry, but we only got first and last places.

2159
01:17:06.536 --> 01:17:07.805
- All right. - I see.

2160
01:17:08.235 --> 01:17:11.046
First place on Chae Yeon's preference ranking is...

2161
01:17:12.315 --> 01:17:17.315
(Who will it be?)

2162
01:17:19.716 --> 01:17:21.855
Yoon Dong Gu!

2163
01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:23.756
Really?

2164
01:17:23.756 --> 01:17:24.885
It's the person behind him. Cha Tae Hyun.

2165
01:17:26.256 --> 01:17:27.796
That's a relief.

2166
01:17:28.055 --> 01:17:29.426
If it's Tae Hyun, there's no problem.

2167
01:17:29.426 --> 01:17:31.025
I knew it.

2168
01:17:31.025 --> 01:17:33.435
- He's so popular. - He has three kids.

2169
01:17:33.435 --> 01:17:35.666
He's the most secure pick in the world.

2170
01:17:35.666 --> 01:17:37.565
It doesn't mean anything.

2171
01:17:37.565 --> 01:17:38.836
It's time to announce who placed last.

2172
01:17:38.836 --> 01:17:40.275
Who do you think is below you?

2173
01:17:40.275 --> 01:17:41.935
Me? Defconn is below me.

2174
01:17:42.445 --> 01:17:43.876
I think everyone is below me.

2175
01:17:44.006 --> 01:17:45.445
- Everyone? - Everyone.

2176
01:17:45.746 --> 01:17:47.345
Why is this person the least likable for you?

2177
01:17:47.876 --> 01:17:49.086
Tell us the reason first.

2178
01:17:49.086 --> 01:17:51.546
I felt like he would leave me behind.

2179
01:17:51.786 --> 01:17:54.385
- What a trashy man. - It must be Jong Min.

2180
01:17:54.385 --> 01:17:56.656
- Jong Min. - How could you do that?

2181
01:17:56.786 --> 01:17:57.855
(Everyone has different ideas.)

2182
01:17:57.855 --> 01:18:00.695
He's very likely to leave her behind.

2183
01:18:00.756 --> 01:18:03.765
This must be your destiny. Joon Young won last place.

2184
01:18:04.296 --> 01:18:05.326
What?

2185
01:18:05.326 --> 01:18:06.996
- My gosh. - Joon Young?

2186
01:18:06.996 --> 01:18:08.435
She thinks he will leave her alone.

2187
01:18:08.435 --> 01:18:09.906
She picked you.

2188
01:18:10.206 --> 01:18:11.406
You do have such an image.

2189
01:18:11.565 --> 01:18:13.406
- He won last place. - Who's my partner now?

2190
01:18:13.406 --> 01:18:15.336
Joon Young got the correct answer anyway.

2191
01:18:15.435 --> 01:18:17.746
Promise her that you won't leave her behind today.

2192
01:18:17.746 --> 01:18:19.475
- Promise her. - You're her partner.

2193
01:18:19.475 --> 01:18:20.716
I promise I won't abandon you.

2194
01:18:21.275 --> 01:18:23.616
- Thank you. - You're a couple now.

2195
01:18:25.756 --> 01:18:27.685
This place is originally our base camp,

2196
01:18:28.256 --> 01:18:32.126
but we can't stay here tonight, because...

2197
01:18:32.126 --> 01:18:33.895
the owner of the house has many private belongings.

2198
01:18:34.095 --> 01:18:38.265
We need to go to the place where we can sleep indoor.

2199
01:18:39.166 --> 01:18:40.536
We talked about it earlier.

2200
01:18:40.935 --> 01:18:44.565
- Driver Lee. - The manager who drives?

2201
01:18:44.565 --> 01:18:47.105
- Yes, he is Driver Lee. - Driver Lee.

2202
01:18:47.635 --> 01:18:48.906
- Let's get going. - Let's go.

2203
01:18:48.906 --> 01:18:50.676
It would have been nice to sleep here.

2204
01:18:50.676 --> 01:18:52.945
- Are you going home? - No.

2205
01:18:53.645 --> 01:18:55.716
Let's say those who sleep outdoors sleep here.

2206
01:18:55.716 --> 01:18:57.645
This is for outdoor sleepers.

2207
01:18:57.645 --> 01:18:59.716
- Chae Yeon. - Yes.

2208
01:18:59.716 --> 01:19:00.956
Let's go.

2209
01:19:03.826 --> 01:19:04.956
Let's go see Driver Lee.

2210
01:19:04.956 --> 01:19:06.426
What kind of person is he?

2211
01:19:06.426 --> 01:19:08.895
- He's meek. - He's a good dancer.

2212
01:19:08.895 --> 01:19:10.426
He's good at singing and dancing.

2213
01:19:10.426 --> 01:19:12.966
He's a very witty man.

2214
01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:14.735
He's very charismatic.

2215
01:19:16.506 --> 01:19:20.605
(Driver Lee is a great problem solver.)

2216
01:19:20.935 --> 01:19:23.445
- I wonder if he changed. - He'll be the same.

2217
01:19:23.445 --> 01:19:24.676
I wonder if he's still the same person.

2218
01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:28.876
- Driver Lee. - When we visit a village,

2219
01:19:28.876 --> 01:19:31.945
we need to see the most powerful people there...

2220
01:19:31.945 --> 01:19:34.685
- and say hi to them. - They have the most food.

2221
01:19:34.685 --> 01:19:36.426
- Let's go say hi to them. - This is what you like.

2222
01:19:36.426 --> 01:19:38.326
- You like leaders. - I do like leaders.

2223
01:19:38.855 --> 01:19:39.956
Look at the car.

2224
01:19:40.256 --> 01:19:43.466
We used to ride the tractor. Look at that.

2225
01:19:43.466 --> 01:19:46.735
- Driver Lee! - Driver Lee.

2226
01:19:46.895 --> 01:19:48.065
Rodriguez.

2227
01:19:48.065 --> 01:19:49.635
Driver Lee.

2228
01:19:49.666 --> 01:19:51.036
I can hear his voice.

2229
01:19:51.966 --> 01:19:53.805
(They have been looking forward to seeing him.)

2230
01:19:53.805 --> 01:19:55.135
- He's there. - Driver Lee!

2231
01:19:55.475 --> 01:19:57.076
Driver Lee!

2232
01:19:58.345 --> 01:19:59.775
He hasn't changed.

2233
01:19:59.775 --> 01:20:02.315
(We have been missing you.)

2234
01:20:04.586 --> 01:20:07.985
(It's been a long time!)

2235
01:20:09.426 --> 01:20:12.796
(We missed you so much.)

2236
01:20:15.695 --> 01:20:17.866
- My goodness. - Driver Lee.

2237
01:20:19.296 --> 01:20:20.796
(Who is this guy?)

2238
01:20:22.166 --> 01:20:23.466
(Let me give you a hug too.)

2239
01:20:23.466 --> 01:20:25.565
- My gosh. - Sir!

2240
01:20:25.565 --> 01:20:26.775
(They're like long lost family members.)

2241
01:20:26.775 --> 01:20:28.435
Get in here.

2242
01:20:28.435 --> 01:20:29.945
Sir!

2243
01:20:29.945 --> 01:20:31.145
My goodness.

2244
01:20:31.145 --> 01:20:32.206
I can't believe it.

2245
01:20:32.206 --> 01:20:33.676
(What on earth is going on?)

2246
01:20:33.676 --> 01:20:35.786
- Hi. - My goodness.

2247
01:20:35.786 --> 01:20:37.385
Welcome!

2248
01:20:37.385 --> 01:20:39.786
- My gosh. - Come here.

2249
01:20:39.786 --> 01:20:41.815
- Ma'am. - Sir!

2250
01:20:41.815 --> 01:20:42.926
It's nice to see you too.

2251
01:20:42.926 --> 01:20:44.326
We hugged seconds ago.

2252
01:20:44.326 --> 01:20:46.225
Sir, it's me.

2253
01:20:46.225 --> 01:20:47.956
Why are you on the verge of tears?

2254
01:20:47.956 --> 01:20:50.065
- It's been so long. - My gosh.

2255
01:20:50.065 --> 01:20:51.265
I'm so happy to see you.

2256
01:20:51.265 --> 01:20:52.635
Of course.

2257
01:20:52.635 --> 01:20:53.695
It's me, Ha Ra.

2258
01:20:53.695 --> 01:20:54.765
Of course.

2259
01:20:54.765 --> 01:20:56.866
- Have you been well? - Yes.

2260
01:20:56.866 --> 01:20:58.235
He's already had a few drinks.

2261
01:20:58.235 --> 01:20:59.376
Have you been drinking?

2262
01:20:59.376 --> 01:21:00.906
- I bet it's makgeolli. - Yes, makgeolli.

2263
01:21:00.906 --> 01:21:02.206
He didn't drink.

2264
01:21:02.206 --> 01:21:03.605
He seems quite drunk.

2265
01:21:03.605 --> 01:21:05.246
He's not answering you.

2266
01:21:05.845 --> 01:21:08.145
- I see you're drunk. - I can smell it.

2267
01:21:08.216 --> 01:21:09.746
(My Shin Young!)

2268
01:21:09.845 --> 01:21:11.485
My gosh.

2269
01:21:11.485 --> 01:21:12.685
You should come inside.

2270
01:21:12.685 --> 01:21:14.055
It's fine.

2271
01:21:14.355 --> 01:21:16.355
They're from One Night Two Days.

2272
01:21:16.355 --> 01:21:17.355
Hi.

2273
01:21:17.355 --> 01:21:19.456
- We can sleep here. - My gosh.

2274
01:21:19.725 --> 01:21:20.756
Can we stay the night?

2275
01:21:20.756 --> 01:21:22.296
That's right.

2276
01:21:22.296 --> 01:21:23.695
It's fine.

2277
01:21:23.695 --> 01:21:25.895
You can stay as long as you want.

2278
01:21:25.895 --> 01:21:28.866
- Really? - It's been so long.

2279
01:21:28.866 --> 01:21:30.866
- That's right. - Can we stay?

2280
01:21:30.866 --> 01:21:32.135
Can we spend the night?

2281
01:21:32.135 --> 01:21:33.536
You can all stay.

2282
01:21:33.536 --> 01:21:34.635
- Great. - Thank you.

2283
01:21:34.635 --> 01:21:37.475
They came here to reminisce.

2284
01:21:38.345 --> 01:21:40.216
They wanted to see you so badly.

2285
01:21:40.216 --> 01:21:43.116
I heard that everybody is waiting...

2286
01:21:43.116 --> 01:21:45.885
at the village hall for you all.

2287
01:21:45.885 --> 01:21:47.815
- We should go then. - Right.

2288
01:21:47.815 --> 01:21:49.326
- Let's go. - She's always been...

2289
01:21:49.326 --> 01:21:50.855
great at moving things along.

2290
01:21:50.855 --> 01:21:52.855
We should go to the village hall then.

2291
01:21:52.855 --> 01:21:54.225
Of course.

2292
01:21:54.225 --> 01:21:55.496
- Let's go. - Right.

2293
01:21:55.496 --> 01:21:57.466
I'm still sad we didn't get to ride it.

2294
01:21:57.695 --> 01:21:58.935
(Next week)

2295
01:21:59.466 --> 01:22:00.895
(Joon Young's new found energy!)

2296
01:22:01.496 --> 01:22:05.366
(Young or old, we all feel awkwardness.)

2297
01:22:06.275 --> 01:22:07.836
(They put on a show for the village.)

2298
01:22:08.336 --> 01:22:09.645
(The virus is back.)

2299
01:22:10.246 --> 01:22:11.605
(I'll win you whatever you like.)

2300
01:22:11.605 --> 01:22:12.975
(It's okay. We have money.)

2301
01:22:13.616 --> 01:22:15.586
(Joon Young is a big spender...)

2302
01:22:15.586 --> 01:22:17.515
(when the money isn't his.)

2303
01:22:17.945 --> 01:22:19.385
(You'll be broke because of him.)

2304
01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:22.385
(Defconn worries even when the money isn't his.)

2305
01:22:23.286 --> 01:22:24.586
(Give me more money.)

2306
01:22:24.855 --> 01:22:27.555
(Tae Hyun is a contract spender.)

2307
01:22:28.326 --> 01:22:30.366
(The squander train heads to the arcade.)

2308
01:22:30.666 --> 01:22:31.966
(What's the secret these three harbor?)

2309
01:22:32.296 --> 01:22:34.836
(Tune in next week!)
