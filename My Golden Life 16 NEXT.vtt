(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.740
Why is the date wrong?

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.410
The Satisfying the Five Senses event...

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.440
begins on the 29th,

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.250
but it says it's the 28th.

7
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.949
Didn't you check the date, Ha Jung?

8
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.280
I thought I did.

9
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.919
Where's Seo Ji An?

10
00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.489
It wasn't her.

11
00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:24.820
Ha Jung did it.

12
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.829
I'm... I'm sorry.

13
00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.199
What about the theme for the hand printing contest?

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.430
Seo Ji An is in charge of that.

15
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.829
Then when do I get the final screening...

16
00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:34.829
of the customer fashion show?

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.600
I've distributed the vote,

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.170
but we haven't decided the date yet.

19
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.339
Are you saying we can wait months for it?

20
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.579
You said you'll cast...

21
00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:44.979
a premium Australian candle brand.

22
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.750
How is that going?

23
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.250
I haven't checked it yet.

24
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.780
Manager Jo.

25
00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.850
When can I get the customer analysis report?

26
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.089
I haven't received the report yet from Ji An.

27
00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:58.789
Ms. Yoon.

28
00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.030
Who are the sponsors for the event?

29
00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.560
Ji An's out looking for them.

30
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.230
Where did she go?

31
00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:05.730
I don't know.

32
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.769
I heard you two are in charge together.

33
00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.769
I didn't have time to be well-acquainted with it.

34
00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:12.269
Then why did you come to the team dinner?

35
00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.909
Where did she go?

36
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.879
(Do Kyung)

37
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.319
Hello.

38
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.549
Come straight to the membership club now.

39
00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.689
I'll let the manager know.

40
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.620
Okay.

41
00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:38.500
Sit.

42
00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:43.524
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

43
00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.040
Where are you coming from?

44
00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:49.010
No, tell me what you've been doing...

45
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.110
without coming to the office today.

46
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.780
I went to a few galleries where Jung Kang Soo...

47
00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:56.750
held exhibitions and talked to his students...

48
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.920
to get his number.

49
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.120
And I was looking around...

50
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.750
a few convention halls that were changed.

51
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.860
You.

52
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.620
You said you wanted me...

53
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.030
to keep the secret until your brother's wedding.

54
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.690
Yes.

55
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.260
Fine.

56
00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:12.999
But under one condition.

57
00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.829
Condition?

58
00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.799
Finish the 40th anniversary event...

59
00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:18.899
of Haesung Apparel.

60
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.010
Pardon?

61
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.010
I said you should also take charge of the finale.

62
00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.110
That girl, Yoon Ha Jung, can never do it.

63
00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.850
No. I'm sure she can do it if I push her more.

64
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.720
I can't fool your parents until then.

65
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.119
You can wait until the 24th,

66
00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:35.790
but you can't until the 4th of November?

67
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.089
10 more days?

68
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.290
And I can't avoid your parents...

69
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.190
once the event begins.

70
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.559
Then tell them today.

71
00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.769
I've told you the condition.

72
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.570
Did you think I'd accept your request for nothing?

73
00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.309
I hoped that you might do that.

74
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.179
You're so shameless.

75
00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.549
I thought I might have to tell your parents today,

76
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.190
so I tried my best to not affect the event by my...

77
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.220
You've been working pretty hard since this morning.

78
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.920
So...

79
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.230
what have you finished?

80
00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.230
I put you in charge of everything...

81
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.299
because I thought you were Eun Seok,

82
00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.670
so the event isn't going to work without you now.

83
00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.170
- Ha Jung can... - What about the company?

84
00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.140
No.

85
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.910
Don't you want to be credited?

86
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.279
I'm worried about the company.

87
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.410
I wanted to be credited. I wanted to do my best.

88
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.549
Then do it.

89
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.850
I'll take care of my parents.

90
00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.820
You're in the advertising video for foreign clients.

91
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.929
The chairman ordered it to help you be acknowledged.

92
00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.630
This all became a serious matter...

93
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.799
because your parents lied to us,

94
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.070
so the 40th anniversary also became important.

95
00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.610
Since it's important, as long as you work it out,

96
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.170
you'll be acknowledged.

97
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.279
Okay.

98
00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.019
You can't avoid seeing my parents today.

99
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.320
They're back.

100
00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:16.720
Just hang in there for today.

101
00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.520
From tomorrow,

102
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.629
I'll help you avoid seeing my parents.

103
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.699
How?

104
00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.129
First,

105
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.330
smile when you see them today.

106
00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.340
Smile to my parents like you did before.

107
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.739
How could I...

108
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.239
possibly smile?

109
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.080
If you don't want my parents to find out,

110
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.080
you must smile.

111
00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:41.449
If you don't want to ruin your brother's wedding,

112
00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.449
you must smile.

113
00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.280
Smile for your parents.

114
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.319
Weren't you trying to tell the truth...

115
00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.790
so you could make things better?

116
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.360
You said you wanted to reduce the humiliation...

117
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.389
your parents will go through.

118
00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:57.830
That's true.

119
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.239
- Okay. - Then you should...

120
00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:05.400
at least do this.

121
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.239
I'm going to tell them once the event is over.

122
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.340
That you told me as soon as you found out...

123
00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:14.710
and that I told you to finish...

124
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.850
the 40th anniversary event.

125
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.249
So don't let them find out before that.

126
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.290
If the event ends successfully,

127
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.660
it means you did great work,

128
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.819
and you've done good service for my family,

129
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.860
so it will make up for that.

130
00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:30.160
Okay.

131
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.929
Let's go. We should meet my parents.

132
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.499
Now?

133
00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:39.770
After seeing them, I'll say...

134
00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.569
that you have to go back to work soon.

135
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.379
Mother. It's me, Do Kyung.

136
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.949
You said you're home, right?

137
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.049
I'm on the way with Eun Seok.

138
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.119
Yes. I thought so too.

139
00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.720
I'll see you at home.

140
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.030
Do it well.

141
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.429
Okay.

142
00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:17.439
We're home.

143
00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:18.739
Hello.

144
00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:23.879
How was Yangpyeong?

145
00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.119
How long have we not met each other?

146
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.720
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.790
Sit down.

148
00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:40.499
What's wrong? You look so drawn.

149
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:43.939
It's because she's been sitting all day.

150
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.100
She doesn't look healthy...

151
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.309
because her blood doesn't circulate well.

152
00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:48.840
I told her to do some stretching earlier,

153
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.040
and her bones cracked.

154
00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:52.439
My goodness.

155
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.980
Do you know the fitness club...

156
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.980
next to our company?

157
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.619
I signed her up there...

158
00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.489
so she can work out before work.

159
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.160
She should rather get more sleep. That's too much.

160
00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.689
She said she keeps waking up early.

161
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:12.330
I think I should work out like he said.

162
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.770
Right. That might be better.

163
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.900
How's Grandfather?

164
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.340
He has someone taking good care of him.

165
00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:23.210
When is he leaving this time?

166
00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:25.980
He never tells us things like that.

167
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.580
It's about time though.

168
00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:30.449
Eun Seok.

169
00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:33.220
I'm sorry for what Do Kyung put you through.

170
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.090
You must've been very upset, right?

171
00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.520
No.

172
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.530
Like I said yesterday, I should've known better.

173
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.699
Is that why you asked me for money? To pay him?

174
00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.670
Did you take that money, Do Kyung?

175
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.699
Yes. It was when we didn't know each other.

176
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.910
I'm sorry for not being honest with you.

177
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.509
Then what about the money?

178
00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:02.650
Do you really have no other debts?

179
00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:04.980
I'm still paying off my student loans.

180
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.549
Really? Then pay that off.

181
00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:09.090
It's more than the loan.

182
00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:10.489
More?

183
00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:13.489
If so, just use it for yourself.

184
00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:17.100
I'm glad it was Eun Seok.

185
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:19.460
I knew this would happen one day, Do Kyung.

186
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.830
Why would you be so careless?

187
00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:24.569
Why would you deal with commoners unnecessarily...

188
00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:25.699
when you have Secretary Yoo?

189
00:08:26.499 --> 00:08:27.739
I'll keep that in mind.

190
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.279
Also, why did you forgive that general manager?

191
00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:33.950
You should've fired him...

192
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.210
as soon as you became the vice president.

193
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.879
He made your sister drive.

194
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:42.649
Tell him to resign tomorrow.

195
00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.489
Please don't.

196
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.889
Her daughter's in middle school.

197
00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:47.259
And he's the family's only income.

198
00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:49.830
What does that got to do with us?

199
00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:52.230
You need to learn from this.

200
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.430
This is why you should keep your distance.

201
00:08:54.999 --> 00:08:56.169
There's nothing good about knowing...

202
00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:57.169
your employee's personal life.

203
00:08:57.499 --> 00:09:00.470
Never get involved in their personal lives.

204
00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:05.039
If we fire the general manager,

205
00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:07.580
Eun Seok will lose ground in her team.

206
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.279
Everyone will know it has to do with the scandal.

207
00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:14.389
The executives didn't train the employees well,

208
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:16.690
so we should listen to Eun Seok this time.

209
00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:20.330
We have to get back to the company.

210
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.629
You have to go back?

211
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.330
I prepared dinner for us.

212
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.830
An employee in the team made a huge mistake.

213
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.669
And our budget was wasted.

214
00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:32.169
So Eun Seok must lead the entire project.

215
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.639
That's why I plan to stay late with her...

216
00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:38.139
and prepare the anniversary event.

217
00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:40.080
But you must have dinner.

218
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.509
Have dinner before going.

219
00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:44.379
We have a dinner meeting with the agency.

220
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.519
We stopped by to say hello since you haven't...

221
00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.190
seen Eun Seok for a while.

222
00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:51.360
We were working out of the office today.

223
00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:52.989
Let's go now.

224
00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:54.060
Okay.

225
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.499
By the way, why aren't you using my card?

226
00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:01.330
I haven't gotten any messages recently.

227
00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:03.800
Since it's a premium credit card,

228
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.970
I've been using cash...

229
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.470
because I was afraid someone might see it.

230
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.310
Let's go.

231
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.610
Okay.

232
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.739
I'll be off now.

233
00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.720
Thank you...

234
00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:27.230
for helping me.

235
00:10:27.489 --> 00:10:29.190
Your gratitude makes me uncomfortable.

236
00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:32.060
I didn't do it for your sake.

237
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.970
But I'm still grateful.

238
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.570
Thank you.

239
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.340
Let's make this clear.

240
00:10:40.409 --> 00:10:42.639
You and I aren't siblings anymore.

241
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.379
We're strangers.

242
00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:47.749
I'm aware of that.

243
00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:49.919
At home, I'll act as if I'm your brother.

244
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.019
Only until our project is over.

245
00:10:54.489 --> 00:10:55.619
Okay.

246
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.300
I just took photos of you.

247
00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:08.269
Oh, my! Yes. I took pictures of you.

248
00:11:08.369 --> 00:11:09.869
Look who's here.

249
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.769
What? You...

250
00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:18.980
That girl.

251
00:11:21.149 --> 00:11:23.180
My real sister, Ji Soo.

252
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.050
What is she doing now?

253
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.639
Why are you not staying in place?

254
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.440
She can't digest her food well.

255
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.239
She's slim.

256
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.239
She goes to work.

257
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.050
She said she was going to leave after two hours.

258
00:11:59.749 --> 00:12:01.450
- Ji Soo. - Yes?

259
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.119
I thought you were an expert at that.

260
00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:04.619
You said you've done that a lot.

261
00:12:04.989 --> 00:12:06.320
Mr. Baker.

262
00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.129
What's that? I have a bad feeling about those eyes.

263
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.129
Could you help me just a little bit with this?

264
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.139
I need to feel the moist and soft batter...

265
00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:21.810
very delicately...

266
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.840
with the tips of my fingers.

267
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.580
So I never touch rough furniture like that.

268
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.879
Isn't it because you can't do this?

269
00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:29.550
What? I can assemble it. I choose not to do it.

270
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.550
When I need to hammer a nail,

271
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.649
I call the guy from the hardware store to do it.

272
00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:34.590
I got it.

273
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.119
- Gosh. - Goodness, Ji Soo.

274
00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:38.759
You need to watch your tongue. Really.

275
00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.629
I need to come up with new recipes today.

276
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:43.129
You should leave now. Stop distracting me.

277
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.800
Mr. Baker. I thought about some new recipes too.

278
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.899
Would you like my ideas?

279
00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:47.999
Well, no.

280
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.200
Why not?

281
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.399
- I'll share mine. - Forget that.

282
00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:52.600
Leave. Just leave.

283
00:13:02.379 --> 00:13:04.720
We can't go to the company in the same car.

284
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.919
Yes.

285
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.909
Where did it go?

286
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.769
What are you looking for?

287
00:13:28.769 --> 00:13:31.810
I had an old photo from my high school days.

288
00:13:33.909 --> 00:13:35.050
I found it.

289
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.850
What is it?

290
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:39.580
My vitamin.

291
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.090
It's just a photo.

292
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.519
Did you start it again?

293
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.259
Your one-sided love for your first crush?

294
00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:48.930
No, I didn't.

295
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.460
I decided to become good friends with her.

296
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.300
Did you get to the bottom of the mystery?

297
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:56.230
That didn't happen either.

298
00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:59.039
Ji An didn't need me...

299
00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:02.009
to find out her problems and resolve them.

300
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.710
I thought...

301
00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:07.379
that she would just need me as a good friend,

302
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.279
so I'm going to be that friend for her.

303
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.649
Why is it so complicated?

304
00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:14.489
How is it complicated?

305
00:14:14.489 --> 00:14:16.320
I just don't need to ask questions.

306
00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:18.889
Okay.

307
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.659
(Written apology)

308
00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:28.570
Ha Jung, are you done writing the apology?

309
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.269
I'm almost done.

310
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:32.399
You're taking forever to write it.

311
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.669
Ji An, what about the budget proposal?

312
00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:36.470
We need to get it approved quickly.

313
00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:37.980
I only need to print it out now.

314
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.550
(Hyuk)

315
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:46.850
I found it while organizing files...

316
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:47.850
on my computer.

317
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.060
The days when Ji An was happy.

318
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.340
How much is this one?

319
00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:48.649
Compared to what you've just seen,

320
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:49.980
it's more expensive.

321
00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:51.519
How much more expensive?

322
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.350
It's double the price.

323
00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:58.590
Just try it on.

324
00:16:01.289 --> 00:16:02.330
Let's go.

325
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:04.659
Soo A.

326
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.029
Thank you.

327
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.139
I wanted to get you good food. Why here?

328
00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:12.440
It's comfortable here.

329
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.239
It's a place of our memories.

330
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.039
Don't you think you'll miss...

331
00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:18.440
spending time here after we get married?

332
00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:20.580
We can come back.

333
00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:22.480
When we do, this won't be the same.

334
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:26.019
After we eat this,

335
00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:28.019
let's go back to the bridal shop.

336
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:29.419
Why?

337
00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:32.060
You'll only get to wear it once.

338
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.960
You need to wear the dress you want.

339
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:35.460
Don't save money on that.

340
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:40.999
Let us...

341
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.470
be naked, Ji Tae.

342
00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:44.769
What?

343
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.039
What on earth are you saying?

344
00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:49.539
- What are you thinking? - I mean...

345
00:16:49.539 --> 00:16:51.680
I was scared just in case if someone heard you.

346
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.409
What do you mean though?

347
00:16:54.909 --> 00:16:56.249
If we try to keep up with others,

348
00:16:56.249 --> 00:16:57.749
we'll break ourselves.

349
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:59.820
And in the end, we'll suffer from it.

350
00:17:00.489 --> 00:17:02.820
If we are not going to have a fancy wedding,

351
00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:05.419
let's rid all formalities and do what we want.

352
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.860
Is wearing the cheapest dress...

353
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.060
what we want?

354
00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:12.199
No. Not wearing one is.

355
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.770
What?

356
00:17:14.229 --> 00:17:16.469
I wrote a list of things for the wedding.

357
00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:22.909
(Wedding hall, wedding dress, tuxedo, reception)

358
00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.080
We should buy only the bed and blankets,

359
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.340
which we will use.

360
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:29.780
We should pay back our debts...

361
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.719
with whatever money we have left.

362
00:17:32.879 --> 00:17:34.590
And let's save up to move out of your house.

363
00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:36.889
Soo A, what has gotten into you?

364
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.060
You're surprising me.

365
00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:40.030
At one time,

366
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.229
I thought I wanted to live like everybody else.

367
00:17:42.689 --> 00:17:43.729
I admit that.

368
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.899
Not wanting a poor life?

369
00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.369
I still don't want to.

370
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.100
You feel the same, don't you?

371
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.199
You didn't want to marry me...

372
00:17:51.199 --> 00:17:53.000
because you couldn't have what others had.

373
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.909
But look what happened to us.

374
00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.010
We lost to love.

375
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.010
That's right. We did. We really lost.

376
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.820
So we should admit our defeat...

377
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.719
and not live like others.

378
00:18:08.189 --> 00:18:10.360
To be honest, I don't even know...

379
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.959
what they mean by others anyway.

380
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.830
Are you sure you won't regret it?

381
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.629
I regretted a lot...

382
00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.600
when I broke up with you.

383
00:18:22.399 --> 00:18:24.600
So did I.

384
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.969
I didn't even think about this alternative.

385
00:18:30.139 --> 00:18:31.139
I hoped we had...

386
00:18:31.139 --> 00:18:33.209
a home as big as this room in the comic book cafe.

387
00:18:33.949 --> 00:18:36.379
I thought about that countless times.

388
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.020
And I regretted a lot...

389
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.389
about why I couldn't ask you...

390
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.219
to marry me.

391
00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:46.159
I really did.

392
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.469
- Dad. - Yes? What is it?

393
00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:57.770
- Dad. - What is it?

394
00:18:57.969 --> 00:19:00.869
Please massage my shoulders, Dad.

395
00:19:01.409 --> 00:19:02.570
What's wrong with your shoulders?

396
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.439
I had to do some laboring today.

397
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.010
And now, my right shoulder hurts a lot.

398
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.119
Is that right? Turn around.

399
00:19:11.419 --> 00:19:13.179
- Here and here. - Okay.

400
00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:16.350
What did you do?

401
00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:18.659
I did something important.

402
00:19:18.889 --> 00:19:20.760
- It hurts. - All right.

403
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.060
- I will take it easy. - Take it easy.

404
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.229
- Is it better now? - It's ticklish.

405
00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:25.260
It must feel good.

406
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.369
You're home, Mom.

407
00:19:27.369 --> 00:19:28.629
Why are you so late?

408
00:19:28.729 --> 00:19:29.899
Have you eaten?

409
00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:33.469
Of course I've eaten. What are you two doing?

410
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.270
You can stop now, Dad. That's good enough.

411
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.310
It's much better.

412
00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:40.409
I'll get you a pain relief patch.

413
00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:41.949
I don't like the smell.

414
00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:44.679
Mom, where do you work? What kind of place is it?

415
00:19:44.979 --> 00:19:46.379
It's just a restaurant.

416
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.850
A restaurant?

417
00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:50.459
What do you do there?

418
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.719
I am the cashier. It's easy work.

419
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.129
The cashier?

420
00:19:54.129 --> 00:19:56.729
It wouldn't be too difficult then.

421
00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.399
- But still... - I have to earn too.

422
00:20:15.709 --> 00:20:16.879
Don't use any of the money...

423
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.080
you earned from that restaurant...

424
00:20:19.179 --> 00:20:21.050
for my children.

425
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.550
What?

426
00:20:23.119 --> 00:20:24.860
If you want to use it, use it for yourself.

427
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.830
Honey.

428
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.830
Do you know how much yesterday's sales were?

429
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.639
I don't need to know, and I don't want to know.

430
00:20:37.139 --> 00:20:41.010
Now, we can buy jewelries for our daughter-in-law.

431
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:43.439
Don't you dare do that.

432
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.810
This is just too much.

433
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.479
Am I doing this for my own happiness?

434
00:20:48.649 --> 00:20:50.520
I told you not to do it.

435
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.919
No.

436
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.619
Since I started it,

437
00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:57.090
I want to earn a lot of money...

438
00:20:57.459 --> 00:21:00.929
and pay the debts Ji Tae got to pay for this house.

439
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.659
And I'm going to give anything Ji Soo wants.

440
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.000
I will support her to study baking abroad.

441
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.800
If she wants to open a bakery, I'll open it.

442
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.869
Give Ji Soo what she wants.

443
00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:14.209
The money is from her parents anyway.

444
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:16.110
But...

445
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.939
don't spend even a cent you got from that shop...

446
00:21:17.939 --> 00:21:19.840
on my children.

447
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.379
Not even a cent. Do it, and I'm divorcing you.

448
00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:27.850
What did you say? Divorce?

449
00:21:27.949 --> 00:21:29.689
When you said you were going to send Ji An there,

450
00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:31.090
I hesitated a little.

451
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.119
And losing Ji An when she was leaving.

452
00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.560
Do you know how much I regret that?

453
00:21:35.659 --> 00:21:37.300
Are you bringing that up again?

454
00:21:38.129 --> 00:21:39.860
It's already over. Why do you keep...

455
00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.699
Who said it's over?

456
00:21:42.629 --> 00:21:44.369
I'm going to bring Ji An back.

457
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:45.770
Seriously.

458
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.810
No matter what you say,

459
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:49.409
I am the breadwinner of this family.

460
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.280
Ji Tae and his fiance...

461
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.209
decided to marry without a fuss.

462
00:21:53.209 --> 00:21:54.709
So let them be.

463
00:21:55.379 --> 00:21:58.679
From now on, I will take care of everything.

464
00:21:59.379 --> 00:22:00.949
- I'm back. - Hello.

465
00:22:00.949 --> 00:22:03.020
Dad, I have something to tell you.

466
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.629
We booked Sangam Park as our wedding venue.

467
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.260
I'm going to wear my normal suit,

468
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.959
and Soo A will wear one of her dresses.

469
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.330
Is she not going to wear a wedding dress?

470
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.669
We decided not to copy other people.

471
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.209
Soo A's family is not in Korea anyway.

472
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.540
And we don't have a lot of relatives anyway.

473
00:22:25.939 --> 00:22:27.479
So we're going to invite...

474
00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:28.850
only some close friends and colleagues...

475
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.520
to minimize the number of guests.

476
00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:32.520
Ji Tae, I know that we don't have money,

477
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.250
but what kind of wedding is that?

478
00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:35.990
You didn't want to get married at a wedding hall.

479
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.520
You should at least dress properly.

480
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.260
But a lot of people have humble weddings.

481
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.830
Many people from other countries dress like that.

482
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.199
We're not in another country, are we?

483
00:22:45.929 --> 00:22:49.199
Did Soo A say she's okay with that?

484
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.100
It was Soo A's idea.

485
00:22:52.199 --> 00:22:53.270
Was it?

486
00:22:53.469 --> 00:22:56.369
She must've thought we were unbelievably poor.

487
00:22:56.369 --> 00:22:59.310
How can a bride not wear a wedding dress?

488
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.209
That's not the reason.

489
00:23:01.209 --> 00:23:03.149
Of course it is. What if we were rich?

490
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.550
Mom, we want to save that money...

491
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.119
so we can get our own place soon.

492
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.919
All right. You were right to think that.

493
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.459
I am sorry and grateful.

494
00:23:21.899 --> 00:23:25.500
Mom, you said you didn't need the appliances.

495
00:23:25.639 --> 00:23:27.709
So we want to buy each of you new clothes.

496
00:23:27.709 --> 00:23:30.580
Never mind. We can't give Soo A anything.

497
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.379
How can we accept anything from her?

498
00:23:32.379 --> 00:23:34.510
It's embarrassing. Tell her we need nothing.

499
00:23:36.179 --> 00:23:37.419
Mom.

500
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.229
Ji Tae.

501
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.530
Yes, Dad?

502
00:23:53.369 --> 00:23:54.969
Is there anything else you want to say?

503
00:23:55.399 --> 00:23:57.439
That's not it.

504
00:23:57.899 --> 00:24:00.439
This isn't much.

505
00:24:00.709 --> 00:24:03.409
At least buy some new shoes for the wedding.

506
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:05.679
It's all right, Dad.

507
00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.479
I'll do the wallpapers for this room myself.

508
00:24:34.209 --> 00:24:38.310
190, 200, 210 dollars.

509
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.879
(100,000 dollars)

510
00:24:43.879 --> 00:24:45.379
Saving to make 100,000 dollars someday.

511
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.050
Should I quit working at the mall...

512
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.219
and work full-time at the club?

513
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:54.830
Right, Cinderella.

514
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.500
Why didn't I tell her not to say a thing?

515
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.929
She wouldn't tell Ji An, would she?

516
00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:07.010
I saved you because you are my sister's sister,

517
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.409
- you brat. - Hey.

518
00:25:08.409 --> 00:25:10.679
What are you talking about? Why am I...

519
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.719
That day, I was there to see my sister.

520
00:25:19.449 --> 00:25:22.219
Gosh, I was too surprised to tell him it's a secret.

521
00:25:24.719 --> 00:25:25.719
(Music Academy)

522
00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.260
You have a waiter named 100,000 Dollars, right?

523
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.260
I must speak with him.

524
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.500
100,000 Dollars?

525
00:25:33.629 --> 00:25:37.540
Oh, he works part-time. He's not here now.

526
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.699
Then he isn't there everyday?

527
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.040
That's right.

528
00:25:43.979 --> 00:25:45.439
A part-time waiter?

529
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.449
Unbelievable.

530
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:57.459
Is she a workaholic?

531
00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:03.600
Are you home now?

532
00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:07.229
Yes. Why are you still up?

533
00:26:08.229 --> 00:26:09.530
I'm going to bed now.

534
00:26:11.939 --> 00:26:14.669
You don't look so well.

535
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.340
I'm just tired.

536
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.979
Goodnight.

537
00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:20.580
Goodnight.

538
00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:26.020
Thank goodness. He didn't tell her.

539
00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.040
I wanted to take you out on a date...

540
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.040
and give this to you.

541
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.780
But it seems there's no time for that.

542
00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.520
Don't work too hard. Tell me if you need anything.

543
00:26:57.979 --> 00:26:59.250
From Dad.

544
00:27:29.949 --> 00:27:31.050
What's wrong?

545
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.449
Please sit beside me.

546
00:27:32.449 --> 00:27:34.419
What? Beside you?

547
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:37.020
Sit beside me.

548
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:38.590
Okay.

549
00:27:45.159 --> 00:27:47.070
Hi, Cinderella.

550
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:53.869
Be quiet. Do you know where you are?

551
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.510
It's a residential area of Pyeongchang-dong...

552
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.139
and a road open to everyone.

553
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.379
Everyone knows who I am.

554
00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:02.709
I was born and raised here.

555
00:28:02.709 --> 00:28:04.949
Then you shouldn't talk to me.

556
00:28:06.689 --> 00:28:08.090
Why are you here again?

557
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:11.459
Did you tell my sister that you've seen me?

558
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.159
She doesn't know you work as a waiter, right?

559
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.830
Right. I heard you are a part-time waiter.

560
00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:18.500
What do you really do? Are you a student?

561
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.000
You called the club, didn't you?

562
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.070
You were worried I told my sister about it.

563
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.740
You were afraid too. Isn't that why you're here?

564
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:26.840
Bingo.

565
00:28:27.469 --> 00:28:28.610
Then...

566
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.550
- But can I trust you? - What else can you do?

567
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.979
Why do you work as a waiter at the club?

568
00:28:36.979 --> 00:28:39.750
Why do you think so? I need to earn money.

569
00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:42.550
Okay. Give me your number then.

570
00:28:42.689 --> 00:28:45.419
You shouldn't work at the clubs I go to.

571
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.959
Okay.

572
00:28:46.959 --> 00:28:48.590
I don't like seeing you at the club either.

573
00:28:48.959 --> 00:28:50.129
Be careful.

574
00:28:50.459 --> 00:28:52.199
So many guys are after you.

575
00:28:52.199 --> 00:28:54.500
It's okay. I have a bodyguard now.

576
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.280
I'll get going.

577
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.159
Ms. Sunwoo Hee?

578
00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:22.159
I almost didn't recognize you.

579
00:29:22.159 --> 00:29:23.229
Long time no see.

580
00:29:23.229 --> 00:29:25.129
Don't you remember me?

581
00:29:25.699 --> 00:29:27.869
It's me, Nam Goo. Kang Nam Goo.

582
00:29:27.869 --> 00:29:28.869
Oh.

583
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.899
It's you again.

584
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.169
Hello.

585
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.379
Hello.

586
00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.379
I won't run into him again, would I?

587
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.159
What if he lives in this town?

588
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.610
Yes.

589
00:30:13.409 --> 00:30:14.780
- Yes. - Hello...

590
00:30:15.479 --> 00:30:16.979
Okay.

591
00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:19.719
Gosh, I'm late.

592
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.850
Unbelievable.

593
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.490
Does he have amnesia?

594
00:30:26.729 --> 00:30:28.159
That can't be it.

595
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.129
He remembered my name.

596
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:37.500
You're here.

597
00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:39.340
I'm not late, am I?

598
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.770
Mr. Baker.

599
00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:43.479
Where do you go every morning?

600
00:30:43.479 --> 00:30:45.510
You dress up for just half an hour.

601
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.750
Just open the store.

602
00:30:47.949 --> 00:30:49.080
Okay.

603
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:53.290
- Welcome. - Good morning.

604
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.250
- Welcome. - Hello.

605
00:30:55.619 --> 00:30:56.990
Welcome.

606
00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.290
Welcome.

607
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.490
From now on, I'll be in charge...

608
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.100
of the foundation event.

609
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.729
Ms. Seo will be the only one in charge of it.

610
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.669
Ms. Yoon will be assisting Ms. Seo.

611
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.939
You will do whatever she tells you to do...

612
00:31:13.939 --> 00:31:15.469
and report it right away.

613
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.709
You can't make another mistake like yesterday.

614
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.379
Okay.

615
00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.080
Ms. Seo,

616
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.020
did you re-send the text messages?

617
00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.179
Yes. We posted an apology...

618
00:31:26.179 --> 00:31:27.719
on social networking sites and our website.

619
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.790
Did you find the event venue?

620
00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:31.419
I've got the stage design drafts...

621
00:31:31.419 --> 00:31:33.020
from two candidates.

622
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.959
And this is the stage design draft...

623
00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:37.100
for the customer model fashion show.

624
00:31:40.369 --> 00:31:42.699
Traditional natural dye fabrics...

625
00:31:42.969 --> 00:31:44.439
and iron pillars.

626
00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.110
They don't match at all.

627
00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.469
I will look for another solution.

628
00:31:50.479 --> 00:31:52.280
The white t-shirts for the printing contest...

629
00:31:52.379 --> 00:31:54.449
will be given out at the venue.

630
00:31:54.949 --> 00:31:56.280
Hanging it out at our stores...

631
00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.419
makes it look like we're forcing them to buy them.

632
00:31:58.419 --> 00:32:00.119
Yes. We will do that.

633
00:32:00.619 --> 00:32:03.560
All right. I'll come back in the evening.

634
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:04.959
You are dismissed.

635
00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.600
Why is he so intense?

636
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.500
I know. Ji An resolved a misunderstanding,

637
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.840
and he used to really like Ji An.

638
00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.110
He even thanked her with a smile.

639
00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.110
He asked for an update,

640
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.850
and now, he checks it every day.

641
00:32:29.649 --> 00:32:32.050
Have you made any mistakes, Ji An?

642
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.820
Ha Jung is the one who made a mistake.

643
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:37.790
He went from super nice...

644
00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.990
to super mean.

645
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.429
It's like we're walking on thin ice. Gosh.

646
00:32:47.729 --> 00:32:50.300
Let's make this clear.

647
00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:52.899
You and I are no longer siblings.

648
00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.369
We are strangers.

649
00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:56.209
If the event ends successfully,

650
00:32:56.209 --> 00:32:57.679
it means you did great work,

651
00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.610
and you've done good service for my family,

652
00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.010
so it will make up for that.

653
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:18.959
The natural dye fabrics will hang here.

654
00:33:21.129 --> 00:33:23.469
If the pillars are closer, the fabrics won't be seen.

655
00:33:24.699 --> 00:33:27.340
It'd be nice if the pillars were wood.

656
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:41.520
Yes, Ji An.

657
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.320
Hyuk, are you busy this afternoon?

658
00:33:44.619 --> 00:33:46.490
Are you looking for a lunch buddy?

659
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.659
No. Today, I have a favor to ask.

660
00:33:58.139 --> 00:34:00.369
Really. Where did it go?

661
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.780
It's lunch time.

662
00:34:06.949 --> 00:34:09.050
I am going to just eat bread here.

663
00:34:09.079 --> 00:34:11.749
No. I need some quiet time alone.

664
00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:13.289
Please eat lunch somewhere else.

665
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:15.820
Can't I watch you come up with the new bread?

666
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.160
No, you can't.

667
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.360
Okay.

668
00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:26.399
I'll be back.

669
00:34:34.769 --> 00:34:36.840
- Cheese donkatsu, please. - Okay.

670
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.280
And please give me the bread first.

671
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:42.680
(Croque-monsieur)

672
00:34:43.649 --> 00:34:45.620
Gosh. Why are you here?

673
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.220
What?

674
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.349
Gosh. What a coincidence.

675
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.860
Gosh. Really. What are you doing here?

676
00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.490
What brings you to this part of the town?

677
00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:55.959
I came in here to get lunch,

678
00:34:55.959 --> 00:34:58.300
and I came to this town to meet someone.

679
00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.360
Alone?

680
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.629
This is good.

681
00:35:00.629 --> 00:35:02.030
I'm alone. Can I join you?

682
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.269
Of course.

683
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.340
You should order.

684
00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.169
They have nice donkatsu here.

685
00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:09.879
Then I'll get the same as you.

686
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.840
One more cheese donkatsu, please.

687
00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840
Okay.

688
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.820
They give you soup and bread too.

689
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.189
You like bread, don't you?

690
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.720
That's why I work at a bakery.

691
00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.789
Why do you look at me like that?

692
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.200
Your life must have been tough, right?

693
00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:36.470
Why would it have been tough?

694
00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.410
Well, your family is poor,

695
00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.269
and your work isn't easy either.

696
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.240
Not at all.

697
00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.140
My life hasn't been tough at all.

698
00:35:46.479 --> 00:35:49.010
My sister... No, Ji An...

699
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:52.849
Your little sister did all the hard work.

700
00:35:52.979 --> 00:35:55.720
I heard you call her Eun Seok.

701
00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.660
You lived as a twin sister.

702
00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:03.360
Your life must've been the same.

703
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.800
I said it wasn't like that.

704
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.800
Looking back now, I feel sorry to her.

705
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.200
Honestly,

706
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.399
I've never given my family even a cent.

707
00:36:12.399 --> 00:36:14.870
But Ji An gave my parents 300 dollars every month...

708
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:17.110
by working part-time.

709
00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.240
She used to give me allowance too.

710
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.709
She gave some to Ji Ho too.

711
00:36:22.579 --> 00:36:24.050
Since we were young,

712
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.590
whenever I was bullied by other kids,

713
00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.450
she came and beat them up.

714
00:36:29.249 --> 00:36:30.289
Did she?

715
00:36:33.729 --> 00:36:35.390
Here's your donkatsu.

716
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.430
Try it.

717
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.070
They cut it for you,

718
00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.599
so it's very convenient to eat.

719
00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:49.110
It's delicious.

720
00:37:03.959 --> 00:37:05.260
I told you I'd take you to a dessert cafe.

721
00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.260
The convenience store again?

722
00:37:06.959 --> 00:37:08.729
You sisters are so alike.

723
00:37:08.729 --> 00:37:09.959
Right?

724
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.329
We used to be really close.

725
00:37:12.329 --> 00:37:13.800
We are very alike.

726
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.070
But shouldn't you not call her your sister?

727
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.370
Why not?

728
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.209
She's not your sister.

729
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.610
What? Why isn't she my sister?

730
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.309
Eun Seok was born in March.

731
00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:29.510
March?

732
00:37:31.919 --> 00:37:34.689
So Ji An was an elder sister anyway.

733
00:37:34.689 --> 00:37:35.789
What?

734
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.930
Is it her fate to be the elder sister?

735
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.499
She thought she was born a minute earlier,

736
00:37:43.499 --> 00:37:45.260
so she's been acting like the elder sister.

737
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.269
And I've been acting like the little sister.

738
00:37:49.769 --> 00:37:51.539
That's not what I meant.

739
00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:53.099
Actually,

740
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.939
I knew she was different.

741
00:37:57.479 --> 00:37:58.479
Ji Ho and I...

742
00:37:58.479 --> 00:38:00.610
are relaxed about everything.

743
00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.910
But Ji An is diligent,

744
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.550
and she's ambitious.

745
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.620
Ji Ho and I thought we didn't need college.

746
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.959
I mean, we don't like studying.

747
00:38:09.959 --> 00:38:11.160
So why would we go to college?

748
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.559
No matter what other people say,

749
00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:14.390
I'll live how I like it to be.

750
00:38:15.559 --> 00:38:16.959
Did you not go to college?

751
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:18.360
I did.

752
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.300
Did you?

753
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:24.070
I wasn't very smart,

754
00:38:24.169 --> 00:38:26.070
so I wasn't going to go to college.

755
00:38:26.669 --> 00:38:30.110
But Ji An secretly submitted my applications,

756
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.979
and I was able to go to a technical college.

757
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.280
- Secretly? - Yes.

758
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.280
She said I couldn't survive in Korea...

759
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.879
without a college diploma.

760
00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.820
We fought so much over it.

761
00:38:42.649 --> 00:38:44.019
Ji An...

762
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.390
was a pretty good sister to you then.

763
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.629
She was an amazing sister.

764
00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:52.030
We might drift apart even more in the future.

765
00:38:53.399 --> 00:38:54.899
But we lived 25 years...

766
00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.740
thinking that we were twins.

767
00:38:58.999 --> 00:39:00.510
I'm sorry.

768
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.240
I gave your sister a hard time, mister.

769
00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.979
Call me as your brother.

770
00:39:06.479 --> 00:39:07.579
Pardon?

771
00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:09.849
Don't call me that. You can call me by my name.

772
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.820
If you're Ji An's brother, you're my brother too.

773
00:39:15.149 --> 00:39:16.249
Right?

774
00:39:17.019 --> 00:39:18.360
Okay, Do Kyung.

775
00:39:21.329 --> 00:39:23.399
All right. That's good.

776
00:39:25.059 --> 00:39:27.470
Please be nice to Ji An.

777
00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.740
Compared to when she lived with our family,

778
00:39:31.099 --> 00:39:32.899
she looks worse.

779
00:39:39.439 --> 00:39:41.510
We'll hang up fabrics naturally dyed...

780
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.879
with indigo leaves as a backdrop.

781
00:39:43.879 --> 00:39:46.149
Like when we hang out laundry to dry.

782
00:39:46.249 --> 00:39:48.820
So we need to hang a rope in the back.

783
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.360
The pillar is steel, right?

784
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.320
That doesn't seem right.

785
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.090
I know. Exactly.

786
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.729
It's traditional dyed fabric.

787
00:39:55.729 --> 00:39:58.200
It doesn't look good with steel pillars.

788
00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.800
So you need wooden pillars here instead.

789
00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:03.740
I knew it. You sure are a design major.

790
00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:07.110
By the way, a customer fashion show?

791
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:09.070
Who'll host this event?

792
00:40:09.669 --> 00:40:11.979
It's for Haesung Apparel's 40th anniversary.

793
00:40:13.209 --> 00:40:14.450
Haesung Apparel?

794
00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.720
You used to work in the Marketing Team there.

795
00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:21.249
Yes. I got a job there again.

796
00:40:21.649 --> 00:40:22.749
When?

797
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.419
Not long ago. I'll tell you about it later.

798
00:40:25.419 --> 00:40:26.959
Can you do this? We don't have much time.

799
00:40:29.689 --> 00:40:32.229
I should ask my boss to make pillars of that size.

800
00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.030
Gosh, I like the woody smell.

801
00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.510
Do you still like it?

802
00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:44.709
You used to like the woody smell.

803
00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:47.510
It's been 10 years.

804
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.709
But I still like it.

805
00:40:50.879 --> 00:40:52.050
You're here.

806
00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:53.620
Hello.

807
00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.519
This is my boss.

808
00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.019
Hello, sir.

809
00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.890
Are you Mr. Sunwoo's friend?

810
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.890
Yes. I'm Seo Ji An.

811
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:04.530
Did you check the draft sent by fax?

812
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:06.870
It needs to be long and thick.

813
00:41:07.129 --> 00:41:09.530
She's your friend. I should make it.

814
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.370
I was hoping it'd keep the grain of wood on it.

815
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:14.840
Can you do that too?

816
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.240
Thank you so much for lunch.

817
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.249
I'll see you again.

818
00:41:20.249 --> 00:41:21.709
- Okay. - Bye.

819
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.349
She even gave me some pocket money.

820
00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:27.820
I wasn't very smart,

821
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.390
so I wasn't going to go to college.

822
00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.990
But Ji An secretly submitted my applications,

823
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.559
and I was able to go to a technical college.

824
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:39.970
Seo Ji An, you're such an unfortunate girl.

825
00:41:49.439 --> 00:41:50.709
What are you doing here?

826
00:41:50.709 --> 00:41:52.640
I was going to ask you the same question.

827
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.780
Well...

828
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.720
Why would I tell you that?

829
00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.820
You're the one who asked the question first.

830
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.360
Just go on your way. We have nothing to say.

831
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.959
You should go first then.

832
00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:09.490
You should go first.

833
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.010
That jerk does have a short temper.

834
00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:32.849
Is he a loan shark or something?

835
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:35.749
What is he doing all dressed up at this hour?

836
00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:48.729
It's still not done?

837
00:43:05.479 --> 00:43:06.519
What's going on?

838
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.990
What are you doing?

839
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:16.829
I was going to do it later myself.

840
00:43:17.129 --> 00:43:20.129
It's raining tonight. Wood shouldn't get wet.

841
00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:23.370
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

842
00:43:23.939 --> 00:43:25.300
Thank you.

843
00:43:26.269 --> 00:43:27.410
Goodbye then.

844
00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:30.939
Bye.

845
00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:39.620
He completed it in an instant.

846
00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:43.050
He's so cool.

847
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.559
Gosh, I can't do this. Pull yourself together.

848
00:43:56.539 --> 00:43:59.169
You're benefiting greatly from Ji An.

849
00:43:59.669 --> 00:44:01.539
You just raised someone else's daughter,

850
00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:02.809
but they got you a restaurant.

851
00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.780
Please don't say that.

852
00:44:06.379 --> 00:44:08.780
There was nobody around.

853
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:11.649
There was only a tiny store...

854
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:13.220
which was closed.

855
00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.419
I found her in the middle of nowhere.

856
00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.559
If we didn't take her, we'd never know...

857
00:44:18.559 --> 00:44:21.390
what would've happened to her there.

858
00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:25.829
Anyway, I'm envious about you making money.

859
00:44:26.899 --> 00:44:28.300
Gosh. I just want...

860
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:31.499
to get Soo A some jewelry as a wedding gift.

861
00:44:32.039 --> 00:44:33.610
You can do that.

862
00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.740
It doesn't have to be something expensive.

863
00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.010
You can get gold necklace or earrings.

864
00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.910
Do you think I can buy a ruby necklace...

865
00:44:40.209 --> 00:44:41.579
and tell Tae Soo that I borrowed money from you?

866
00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.110
Why would you say you borrowed money from me?

867
00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.890
Tae Soo doesn't want to use the money from here?

868
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.620
He has no idea why I'm doing all this.

869
00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.390
I understand.

870
00:44:54.629 --> 00:44:57.229
Tae Soo has his pride. You shouldn't do that.

871
00:44:57.229 --> 00:44:58.459
Listen to your husband.

872
00:44:58.459 --> 00:45:00.300
Why would you say that?

873
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.499
Why should I listen to Tae Soo?

874
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.399
Ji Tae is my son.

875
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.370
We are not doing anything for his wedding.

876
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.740
Just let Tae Soo stand on his pride.

877
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:12.680
He has loved and cared about you all his life.

878
00:45:12.879 --> 00:45:16.510
Hae Ja, you have a high opinion of Tae Soo...

879
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.280
because you used to like him.

880
00:45:18.379 --> 00:45:19.450
Gosh.

881
00:45:20.189 --> 00:45:21.249
Hey.

882
00:45:21.249 --> 00:45:22.749
You think I didn't know about that?

883
00:45:23.019 --> 00:45:24.760
That's why you tried...

884
00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.590
to set me up with your husband on a double date.

885
00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.700
You just wanted to hang out with Tae Soo.

886
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:34.200
Well, all right. I did.

887
00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:36.840
That's when Seok Doo asked me out...

888
00:45:36.939 --> 00:45:39.169
and Tae Soo asked you out.

889
00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.640
Why would you say that now?

890
00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.579
Just do it yourself.

891
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.809
Gosh, Hae Ja.

892
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.849
Hae Ja. Hae Ja.

893
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.550
Yes. I know that.

894
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.419
I'm just asking you to be sure.

895
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.120
Really? Mr. Jung Kang Soo's pupil?

896
00:45:58.019 --> 00:46:00.260
Then can I get the phone number?

897
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:04.099
Okay.

898
00:46:07.269 --> 00:46:08.499
I see.

899
00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:13.870
Dad, here.

900
00:46:15.809 --> 00:46:17.140
Hold this.

901
00:46:34.289 --> 00:46:35.530
Gosh, it's done.

902
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.329
- Nice work. - All right.

903
00:46:56.249 --> 00:46:58.050
Put this over there.

904
00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:00.590
Wait.

905
00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.849
Should it go over there?

906
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.590
Let's put it over here. Here. Yes.

907
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.090
Seok Doo.

908
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:10.629
I sent you the estimate for the motorcycle parts.

909
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.070
I guess Ho Chi Minh City would be a better option.

910
00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.010
I couldn't reach Mr. Jung Kang Soo.

911
00:47:27.479 --> 00:47:29.410
I heard he lost his wife and son...

912
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:31.379
from a car accident a few years ago.

913
00:47:31.749 --> 00:47:33.890
After that, he went off the grid...

914
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:36.090
and moved to a rural area.

915
00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:38.820
But nobody knows where he is now.

916
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.030
Really?

917
00:47:41.289 --> 00:47:44.629
I guess you should choose either Mr. Ki or Mr. Cho.

918
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.030
We changed the stage design to wooden pillars.

919
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.800
Once you confirm the site, we'll be almost ready.

920
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.769
And you should choose the dyeing master.

921
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.640
I'll look for him once more.

922
00:47:55.809 --> 00:47:56.879
Pardon?

923
00:47:56.879 --> 00:47:59.640
I just can't give up on his indigo color.

924
00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.780
I know these masters just as good.

925
00:48:04.519 --> 00:48:06.050
But to launch a new brand...

926
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.890
Excuse me.

927
00:48:12.059 --> 00:48:13.120
Answer it.

928
00:48:19.459 --> 00:48:20.729
Hello?

929
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:22.099
Eun Seok?

930
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:23.970
Yes.

931
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:25.870
Grandfather.

932
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:29.709
Come to Yangpyeong after work.

933
00:48:30.579 --> 00:48:32.439
I'm going to Hawaii tomorrow.

934
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.879
Today? Yangpyeong?

935
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.919
Come with your brother and stay over.

936
00:48:38.419 --> 00:48:41.450
Excuse me. I'm with Do Kyung now.

937
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:44.919
He wants us to come and stay over tonight.

938
00:48:48.059 --> 00:48:49.129
Grandfather.

939
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:50.899
Were you with her?

940
00:48:51.099 --> 00:48:52.599
Yes, we were having a meeting.

941
00:48:53.229 --> 00:48:54.530
I'm sorry,

942
00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.039
but we have a seminar tomorrow.

943
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:59.800
We delayed marketing the winter products...

944
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.039
to prepare for the 40th anniversary event.

945
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.780
We'll do it all at the seminar.

946
00:49:06.439 --> 00:49:07.979
What time is your flight?

947
00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:10.649
We'll go to Yangpyeong after the seminar.

948
00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.879
We have a late meeting...

949
00:49:12.879 --> 00:49:14.620
and can't spend the night with you.

950
00:49:15.249 --> 00:49:17.419
We're meeting an event planner in the evening.

951
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.030
We can only drop by...

952
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:22.260
to say goodbye.

953
00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.930
A seminar? Tomorrow?

954
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.070
Sorry for the sudden notice,

955
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:30.769
but we haven't discussed the new winter line...

956
00:49:30.769 --> 00:49:33.070
because of the anniversary event.

957
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.140
Will it be for 1 night and 2 days?

958
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.280
No, it'll be for one day.

959
00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:38.939
We'll work hard all day,

960
00:49:38.939 --> 00:49:40.979
have a nice dinner and come back.

961
00:49:41.249 --> 00:49:43.519
To check on the 40th anniversary event.

962
00:49:54.329 --> 00:49:55.559
Yes, Grandfather.

963
00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.160
I'll call when we leave.

964
00:50:01.499 --> 00:50:03.070
What if he finds out...

965
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:04.470
we don't have a seminar?

966
00:50:04.769 --> 00:50:05.769
We will go.

967
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.410
How?

968
00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:09.439
We didn't even make a reservation.

969
00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:10.709
I did.

970
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.979
Grandfather comes and goes...

971
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.419
whenever he wants without notice.

972
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.090
I thought he'd leave soon,

973
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.820
but I wasn't sure when,

974
00:50:21.919 --> 00:50:23.860
so I'd booked a place for the seminar.

975
00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:29.260
I thought he'd want to spend the night with you.

976
00:50:30.729 --> 00:50:31.729
You can never...

977
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:34.229
deceive my grandfather.

978
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.200
Unless it's only a short while.

979
00:50:45.079 --> 00:50:47.749
You're so busy with the seminar too.

980
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:49.450
I might end up forgetting...

981
00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.050
what you look like.

982
00:50:52.379 --> 00:50:53.490
I'm sorry.

983
00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:55.919
You'll feel like that.

984
00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:57.890
You won't see much of us...

985
00:50:58.189 --> 00:51:00.760
until after the anniversary event.

986
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:02.260
Okay.

987
00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.099
I'm sure Eun Seok's stressed too.

988
00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:06.800
Right. I should be more considerate.

989
00:51:07.399 --> 00:51:09.570
Do your best at the seminar.

990
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:11.870
And have fun with your grandfather.

991
00:51:12.399 --> 00:51:13.470
I will.

992
00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:16.110
How will you get there?

993
00:51:16.169 --> 00:51:17.709
I'll drive my car.

994
00:51:17.709 --> 00:51:20.079
She'll come with her team.

995
00:51:21.209 --> 00:51:23.180
It'll be cramped and uncomfortable.

996
00:51:23.919 --> 00:51:24.919
It's fine.

997
00:51:24.919 --> 00:51:27.519
I like chatting with my team.

998
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:29.990
Goodbye.

999
00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.620
Let's go.

1000
00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.559
Okay. Goodbye.

1001
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:31.050
Ha Jung.

1002
00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:33.320
Did you bring the report on our customers...

1003
00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.320
and the score cards from the Design Team?

1004
00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.760
I did.

1005
00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.459
You don't do all the work.

1006
00:52:44.599 --> 00:52:45.860
Doesn't it feel like...

1007
00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.499
we're on an outing?

1008
00:52:47.629 --> 00:52:49.729
It must be good to be you.

1009
00:52:49.729 --> 00:52:52.340
You already forgot how you got scolded.

1010
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.209
I wrote an apology for that.

1011
00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:56.269
But do we have to...

1012
00:52:56.269 --> 00:52:58.579
discuss our new line at the seminar?

1013
00:52:58.579 --> 00:53:00.979
We always had a seminar once or twice a year.

1014
00:53:00.979 --> 00:53:02.579
It's just for one day.

1015
00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:04.820
We get to feast afterwards.

1016
00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:07.390
He'll buy us beef, won't he?

1017
00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.079
Try on the belt.

1018
00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.749
Both hands in pockets.

1019
00:53:38.649 --> 00:53:40.490
Turn around like that.

1020
00:53:41.649 --> 00:53:43.289
Turn to one side.

1021
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.289
How does it feel?

1022
00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:50.729
Yesterday, I tried on last winter's best seller.

1023
00:53:50.729 --> 00:53:53.099
It's much lighter and warmer than that.

1024
00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:55.999
And it's a better fit because of the waistline.

1025
00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:58.140
Warmer, better material.

1026
00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:00.410
What brand doesn't claim that?

1027
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:04.039
What's the main marketing point?

1028
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.240
We'll give it...

1029
00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.349
a special name to differentiate it.

1030
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:09.809
A special name? How?

1031
00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:11.620
I don't know yet.

1032
00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:13.919
How about using people's memories?

1033
00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.689
"We don't just warm you,"

1034
00:54:16.689 --> 00:54:18.990
"but we warm your heart as well."

1035
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.559
At our anniversary event,

1036
00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:23.829
our hand printing project theme is about fairytales.

1037
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.030
Not bad. Let's move on.

1038
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.570
The next one's a cute jacket.

1039
00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:31.800
- Ha Jung, you try it on. - Okay.

1040
00:54:50.459 --> 00:54:51.459
Vice Chairman Choi?

1041
00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:54.789
When did this tree get so big?

1042
00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.160
Well...

1043
00:54:56.629 --> 00:54:58.700
It was planted when we moved here.

1044
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:02.499
That was 20 years ago.

1045
00:55:04.769 --> 00:55:05.870
Vice Chairman Choi.

1046
00:55:07.209 --> 00:55:09.110
I'll walk to the restaurant.

1047
00:55:22.019 --> 00:55:23.959
We'll take a break for 10 minutes...

1048
00:55:23.959 --> 00:55:25.360
then resume the meeting.

1049
00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:44.610
Our female consumers will think of a fairytale.

1050
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.079
Let's get the media talk about that.

1051
00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:49.919
We could also get an interview...

1052
00:55:49.919 --> 00:55:51.220
with the person who won...

1053
00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:53.419
the logo designing competition.

1054
00:55:53.519 --> 00:55:54.519
Good idea.

1055
00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:56.760
Then we'll go ahead and print samples.

1056
00:55:56.890 --> 00:55:59.059
Ji An and Ha Jung, make the jeans.

1057
00:55:59.059 --> 00:56:01.189
Ms. Yang and Ms. Song, make the coats.

1058
00:56:01.329 --> 00:56:02.430
Okay.

1059
00:56:06.899 --> 00:56:09.129
Who will collect the score cards?

1060
00:56:09.229 --> 00:56:11.039
Ji An, will you collect them...

1061
00:56:11.039 --> 00:56:12.840
and send the data to our chat group?

1062
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.840
Yes, sir.

1063
00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:19.240
Will 20 minutes be enough?

1064
00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.910
Yes, sir.

1065
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:23.879
While Ji An does that,

1066
00:56:23.879 --> 00:56:26.419
let's see if we can make up a nice name.

1067
00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:39.499
Well done, everyone.

1068
00:56:44.169 --> 00:56:46.140
I booked a table at Goso Beef.

1069
00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:47.340
Enjoy dinner.

1070
00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.269
You won't come with us?

1071
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.079
Don't you think...

1072
00:56:51.079 --> 00:56:53.180
you'd be more comfortable without me?

1073
00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.649
Goodbye then. I must get back to Seoul.

1074
00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.990
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1075
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:10.959
He's so hardcore.

1076
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.999
He worked all day then disappeared.

1077
00:57:12.999 --> 00:57:14.169
That's great.

1078
00:57:14.169 --> 00:57:16.269
The best boss is the kind who gives...

1079
00:57:16.269 --> 00:57:17.399
lots of money and leaves.

1080
00:57:17.399 --> 00:57:20.110
Goso Beef is a really famous restaurant.

1081
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.340
I've been there before, and it's not that bad.

1082
00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:24.410
Let's pack up then.

1083
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:25.439
Okay.

1084
00:57:34.149 --> 00:57:37.820
I'll deal with Grandpa. You stay with your team.

1085
00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.769
Your flight leaves at 9:20pm?

1086
00:57:49.099 --> 00:57:51.169
You must leave Yangpyeong by 7pm then.

1087
00:57:51.539 --> 00:57:54.240
I'll bring Eun Seok over before 6pm.

1088
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:01.879
Grandfather, it's Do Kyung.

1089
00:58:01.879 --> 00:58:03.919
Hi, where are you?

1090
00:58:03.919 --> 00:58:05.419
I'm really sorry.

1091
00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:09.220
My car just shut down. I stopped by the roadside.

1092
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:10.820
Your car shut down?

1093
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:12.559
Why?

1094
00:58:13.729 --> 00:58:15.059
Are you hurt?

1095
00:58:15.059 --> 00:58:16.660
No, I managed to stop in time.

1096
00:58:17.229 --> 00:58:20.200
But I don't think I can get my car fixed...

1097
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.370
and get to Yangpyeong...

1098
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.340
before you have to leave.

1099
00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.399
Really?

1100
00:58:25.769 --> 00:58:27.410
Where are you now?

1101
00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:29.610
I really can't make it.

1102
00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:30.680
Do Kyung.

1103
00:58:32.579 --> 00:58:33.579
Aunt Jin Hee.

1104
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.149
What are you doing there?

1105
00:58:36.849 --> 00:58:38.349
What do you think?

1106
00:58:38.379 --> 00:58:40.789
I'm here to see my dad off.

1107
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:43.019
You always came straight to the airport.

1108
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:45.789
Let's not waste time on the phone.

1109
00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.260
Where are you?

1110
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:50.499
I'll send my car over. You can come that way.

1111
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:52.660
Your car?

1112
00:58:52.999 --> 00:58:56.329
Your grandfather would be upset to miss Eun Seok.

1113
00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.939
Let him see her for at least 30 minutes.

1114
00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.640
Text me where you are right now.

1115
00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.749
Whose phone is it?

1116
00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:19.720
Mr. Choi.

1117
00:59:21.559 --> 00:59:22.660
Ji An?

1118
00:59:23.629 --> 00:59:24.729
Yes.

1119
00:59:25.629 --> 00:59:26.729
Yes, sir.

1120
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:28.669
Turn the car around.

1121
00:59:28.769 --> 00:59:30.039
What's wrong?

1122
00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.939
Dye artist Jung Kang Soo.

1123
00:59:31.939 --> 00:59:33.070
They got in touch.

1124
00:59:33.669 --> 00:59:35.539
He says you have to get over there,

1125
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:37.579
so we're to drop you off.

1126
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.640
He found Jung Kang Soo?

1127
00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.120
See you tomorrow.

1128
00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.300
Where's Mr. Jung?

1129
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.129
- Wear your seat belt. - Okay.

1130
01:00:14.379 --> 01:00:16.450
We're meeting them here?

1131
01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:18.919
- What now? - What now?

1132
01:00:20.519 --> 01:00:22.550
Why did Auntie have to be there?

1133
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:27.059
Can't we just wait here, then get there in her car?

1134
01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:29.490
I'll prepare myself.

1135
01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:31.329
We won't be there for long.

1136
01:00:31.499 --> 01:00:34.169
No. She wants me to drive her car...

1137
01:00:34.499 --> 01:00:36.599
and leave mine with her driver.

1138
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:38.700
What should we do then?

1139
01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:40.269
What should we do?

1140
01:00:40.669 --> 01:00:42.870
Let's sabotage my car.

1141
01:00:43.209 --> 01:00:44.410
Your car?

1142
01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:46.579
It's over if they find out we lied.

1143
01:00:46.649 --> 01:00:48.309
How can we do that?

1144
01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:53.149
Hang on.

1145
01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:57.890
Puncture a tire.

1146
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.990
What for? You said the car shut down.

1147
01:01:01.129 --> 01:01:02.559
Right, I did.

1148
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:05.559
Why did I say that?

1149
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.430
I should've blamed it on the tire.

1150
01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.200
What now?

1151
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:12.240
(Car shutting down in movie)

1152
01:01:14.769 --> 01:01:15.769
What are you doing?

1153
01:01:15.769 --> 01:01:17.809
I saw a movie where a car shut down.

1154
01:01:18.079 --> 01:01:19.280
What?

1155
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.079
I know nothing about cars.

1156
01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.079
You have to step on it. Brake on my signal.

1157
01:01:25.079 --> 01:01:26.180
Okay.

1158
01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.289
Come on.

1159
01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.320
Are you okay under there?

1160
01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.749
You're too noisy. Be quiet.

1161
01:02:01.749 --> 01:02:04.059
Okay, I will. I'll be quiet.

1162
01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.490
Hurry up, will you?

1163
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:11.200
Okay, Dad.

1164
01:02:11.629 --> 01:02:12.860
See you at the airport.

1165
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:18.200
Jin Hee's in Yangpyeong?

1166
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:22.410
To tell Dad she didn't plan Eun Seok's scandal.

1167
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:24.979
I really can't understand...

1168
01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.280
why he wants to cover this up.

1169
01:02:28.149 --> 01:02:29.450
You two sisters...

1170
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.620
are really disgusting.

1171
01:02:34.249 --> 01:02:36.990
What did you just say?

1172
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.160
Go to the airport on your own.

1173
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:50.570
Okay.

1174
01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.169
Our driver checked the roads,

1175
01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:56.010
but an accident on a highway caused a jam.

1176
01:02:56.709 --> 01:02:58.379
We have to leave now.

1177
01:02:58.379 --> 01:03:01.709
Oh, dear. Then what about Eun Seok and Do Kyung?

1178
01:03:01.709 --> 01:03:03.720
What about them? I don't get to see them.

1179
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:05.879
Tell your driver to turn around.

1180
01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:09.450
Not yet? You said you saw the movie.

1181
01:03:11.289 --> 01:03:13.930
Seo Ji An, this is too dangerous.

1182
01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:15.189
Get out, will you?

1183
01:03:15.189 --> 01:03:16.430
Just a moment.

1184
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.999
I'll just bribe my aunt's driver.

1185
01:03:18.999 --> 01:03:20.300
Get out from under there.

1186
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.430
I did it.

1187
01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:22.829
You did it?

1188
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:29.510
Look.

1189
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.379
You did it.

1190
01:03:44.403 --> 01:03:49.403
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1191
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:37.910
(My Golden Life)

1192
01:04:38.879 --> 01:04:41.379
Are you grumpy that I did...

1193
01:04:41.379 --> 01:04:42.950
something you couldn't?

1194
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:45.050
Why would I be? You're the weird one.

1195
01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:46.649
Am I the strange one for not being able to do that?

1196
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.189
Can you completely get over with...

1197
01:04:49.189 --> 01:04:50.620
how you once felt about someone?

1198
01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.189
Did you meet an old flame?

1199
01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:54.260
Why are you in a suit?

1200
01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.829
- I'm leaving for lunch. - Mr. Baker.

1201
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:57.729
I want to quit.

1202
01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.760
What?

1203
01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.800
Do you know a Mr. Jung Kang Soo?

1204
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.899
He dyes fabrics.

1205
01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.370
He lives in Sewol-ri.

1206
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.269
About 30 minutes up a mountain.

1207
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:08.309
Up a mountain?

1208
01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:10.979
Oh, that strange house?

1209
01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:13.849
Seo Ji An!

1210
01:05:16.209 --> 01:05:17.349
Do Kyung.
