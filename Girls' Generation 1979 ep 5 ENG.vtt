3
00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:10.164
Your hair...

4
00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:14.423
Hey. Son Jin.

5
00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.993
Dong Moon. What are you doing here?

6
00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:25.794
- Hypocrite. - What? Hypocrite?

7
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:36.204
Hey, what is that?

8
00:00:44.213 --> 00:00:46.054
Hey. Hold on.

9
00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:47.683
Hey. Stop.

10
00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.124
Dong Moon.

11
00:00:50.753 --> 00:00:52.094
Dong Moon, stop.

12
00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:58.094
Look.

13
00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:01.033
Don't you dare come onto Jung Hee again.

14
00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:04.033
I really won't forgive you.

15
00:01:05.274 --> 00:01:07.134
Got it?

16
00:01:09.243 --> 00:01:10.304
Dong Moon.

17
00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:12.314
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:14.013
What?

19
00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:17.384
- You again? - Did you follow me here?

20
00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:20.584
That's not it.

21
00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:22.683
I wasn't following you, I...

22
00:01:22.823 --> 00:01:24.894
- Jung Hee! - Number three.

23
00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:26.724
We're in trouble. You need to go home.

24
00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:28.123
What is it?

25
00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:31.164
Bong Soo is about to die.

26
00:01:31.694 --> 00:01:32.694
What?

27
00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:36.564
You call yourself a human being?

28
00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:39.903
Are you really my one and only son?

29
00:01:40.403 --> 00:01:42.203
After all I did to get here,

30
00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:45.013
how could my only son be so pathetic?

31
00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:48.243
Whom can I live for? I should just die.

32
00:01:48.343 --> 00:01:50.213
- Get up! - Mr. Lee.

33
00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:53.284
Why are you doing this so early in the morning?

34
00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.483
Your son needs to go to school.

35
00:01:55.483 --> 00:01:57.823
School? He doesn't need school.

36
00:01:58.453 --> 00:02:01.123
Are you even paying attention to your son?

37
00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:03.364
You don't know if he is at the study room...

38
00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:06.534
or hanging out at some random place.

39
00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:08.934
You call yourself a mom?

40
00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:10.934
I'm a moron.

41
00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:13.703
I'm not a mom. I'm a moron. So what?

42
00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:15.773
Okay. So stay out of it.

43
00:02:15.773 --> 00:02:19.244
Stand. Stand straight! I'll break your fingers!

44
00:02:20.314 --> 00:02:22.184
- Stand. - Stop it!

45
00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:24.384
Stop hitting him!

46
00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:26.414
Father.

47
00:02:28.483 --> 00:02:30.583
Where are you coming from?

48
00:02:31.053 --> 00:02:34.094
Did you take away his pass to the study room?

49
00:02:34.094 --> 00:02:35.823
I didn't take it away.

50
00:02:35.893 --> 00:02:37.494
He told me to go...

51
00:02:37.494 --> 00:02:39.594
That's because he's immature.

52
00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:41.333
How could you take it?

53
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.434
How dare a chick stay out all night?

54
00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:47.944
It's not like I was playing.

55
00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:50.303
- I was studying. - What?

56
00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.714
So why did you send only him to a study room,

57
00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.083
and not me?

58
00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.944
What did you just say?

59
00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:59.384
- Stop it. - I told you...

60
00:02:59.384 --> 00:03:01.953
to be grateful I sent you to school.

61
00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:03.254
How dare you...

62
00:03:03.624 --> 00:03:04.654
Get over here.

63
00:03:04.823 --> 00:03:06.594
Stand right here. Now.

64
00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:07.594
No!

65
00:03:07.594 --> 00:03:09.423
- I did nothing wrong. - What?

66
00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:12.594
Don't take out your anger at Bong Soon on me.

67
00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:14.064
Lee Jung Hee. Where are you going?

68
00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:16.134
Stop right there! Get over here!

69
00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:17.603
Get over here.

70
00:03:17.603 --> 00:03:19.073
- Stop it. - Get over here.

71
00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:20.134
No!

72
00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.374
I have no reason to be hit and did nothing wrong!

73
00:03:22.374 --> 00:03:24.744
- Don't do this. - Move, will you?

74
00:03:25.314 --> 00:03:27.384
- Open the door. Now! - Father.

75
00:03:27.814 --> 00:03:29.384
Open the door right now!

76
00:03:29.384 --> 00:03:30.444
Why you...

77
00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:32.654
Open the door before I break it down!

78
00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:34.453
Father, please!

79
00:03:34.453 --> 00:03:37.053
I was wrong! Hit me instead!

80
00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:39.694
What if our Bong Soo dies?

81
00:03:40.624 --> 00:03:41.624
- Move. - Oh no.

82
00:03:41.624 --> 00:03:43.494
I'm sorry, Father!

83
00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:44.494
Let go.

84
00:03:48.034 --> 00:03:49.434
You brat!

85
00:03:49.703 --> 00:03:51.703
Let's go die together!

86
00:03:53.803 --> 00:03:55.904
- Let's die. - Mom!

87
00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:58.773
Let's die. Let's die together!

88
00:03:59.214 --> 00:04:01.043
- What are you doing? - Let's die!

89
00:04:01.043 --> 00:04:02.244
- Stop it. - You useless...

90
00:04:02.244 --> 00:04:04.914
If you were going to be treated like trash,

91
00:04:04.914 --> 00:04:08.423
you should've died in my belly!

92
00:04:08.423 --> 00:04:10.624
Why were you even born?

93
00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:13.194
You're nothing but a pain in the neck!

94
00:04:13.194 --> 00:04:14.464
Die.

95
00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:16.393
- Let's die together. - I said to stop!

96
00:04:16.393 --> 00:04:17.934
- Die! - Stop it!

97
00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:22.033
I know that's targeted at me, okay?

98
00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:23.434
It's all my fault.

99
00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:25.504
I'm a loser. Happy?

100
00:04:25.874 --> 00:04:26.973
That's enough.

101
00:04:28.374 --> 00:04:29.504
Father!

102
00:04:31.773 --> 00:04:33.044
Jung Hee, are you okay?

103
00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:43.184
What is this?

104
00:05:01.203 --> 00:05:02.604
Why are you lying down in here?

105
00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:07.143
Does it hurt? Your back.

106
00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:08.614
It doesn't hurt at all.

107
00:05:08.984 --> 00:05:11.153
I've been hit by you too many times.

108
00:05:12.814 --> 00:05:15.653
Don't you have any fears?

109
00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:18.893
How can you spend a night where it's full of boys?

110
00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:25.734
Don't worry.

111
00:05:26.194 --> 00:05:28.203
I won't go there starting today.

112
00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:31.203
Jung Hee.

113
00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:34.944
I made breakfast at the factory.

114
00:05:35.143 --> 00:05:36.903
- Eat it. - That's okay.

115
00:05:37.044 --> 00:05:38.314
I'm just going to go.

116
00:05:38.413 --> 00:05:40.744
Eat it before you go.

117
00:05:40.913 --> 00:05:42.013
Forget it.

118
00:05:42.114 --> 00:05:43.884
Eat it.

119
00:05:45.114 --> 00:05:47.453
You got a beating so early in the morning.

120
00:05:48.283 --> 00:05:50.283
You must be exhausted.

121
00:05:57.694 --> 00:05:59.663
Did Dong Moon come all the way here?

122
00:06:00.134 --> 00:06:02.304
Yes. He was worried about you.

123
00:06:02.604 --> 00:06:03.734
He's so nosy.

124
00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.033
Did Bong Soo...

125
00:06:07.773 --> 00:06:08.973
get beat a lot?

126
00:06:10.073 --> 00:06:13.413
Yes. He probably can't walk ever again.

127
00:06:13.843 --> 00:06:14.944
Really?

128
00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:18.713
He can't walk?

129
00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:20.453
Oh no.

130
00:06:32.194 --> 00:06:33.833
Stay still, will you?

131
00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:36.434
It hurts so much. Are you trying to kill me?

132
00:06:37.734 --> 00:06:39.304
Did you get caught...

133
00:06:39.504 --> 00:06:42.374
- reading comic books? - Yes.

134
00:06:43.504 --> 00:06:46.944
How did my dad know? No one knows about it.

135
00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:49.643
He's like a Japanese policeman.

136
00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:50.953
It's all your fault.

137
00:06:51.283 --> 00:06:53.754
Jung Hee got hit because of you too.

138
00:06:55.054 --> 00:06:57.694
Hey! Why did you hit me there?

139
00:07:00.093 --> 00:07:01.263
What happened?

140
00:07:02.893 --> 00:07:04.593
- Salute. - Is Jung Hee okay?

141
00:07:04.593 --> 00:07:06.533
Yes, she's fine, but I'm not...

142
00:07:06.533 --> 00:07:08.033
Why are you asking?

143
00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:10.263
What?

144
00:07:24.114 --> 00:07:26.653
Bae Dong Moon. Have you been training?

145
00:07:26.653 --> 00:07:28.453
I told you, haven't I?

146
00:07:29.754 --> 00:07:31.554
Please be clear about how you act.

147
00:07:33.194 --> 00:07:35.294
- You said you like her? - Yes.

148
00:07:35.564 --> 00:07:39.494
Whenever she's about to find peace,

149
00:07:39.734 --> 00:07:41.463
- you keep on... - Dong Moon.

150
00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:44.504
That's not how you love someone.

151
00:07:45.573 --> 00:07:47.203
- Pardon? - It's not love...

152
00:07:47.773 --> 00:07:49.004
just because you like someone.

153
00:07:51.374 --> 00:07:52.944
You should look at the other person.

154
00:07:53.544 --> 00:07:57.013
If they don't want you, you should step back.

155
00:07:58.413 --> 00:07:59.554
That's love.

156
00:07:59.684 --> 00:08:01.054
Is that why...

157
00:08:02.854 --> 00:08:04.624
you're watching Hae Joo...

158
00:08:06.494 --> 00:08:07.963
from a distance?

159
00:08:14.504 --> 00:08:16.134
She won't budge,

160
00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:18.333
so you're avoiding her because of your pride.

161
00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.273
You're pretty daring.

162
00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:28.283
I'll be open with you.

163
00:08:29.444 --> 00:08:32.413
You're nothing to Jung Hee.

164
00:08:32.614 --> 00:08:35.153
That's why you should stop being pathetic...

165
00:08:36.124 --> 00:08:37.553
and give up what you can't have.

166
00:08:40.224 --> 00:08:42.594
You'll be late. Go in.

167
00:08:45.663 --> 00:08:47.293
It's not right to give up...

168
00:08:49.704 --> 00:08:51.104
just because it's not easy.

169
00:08:53.474 --> 00:08:54.773
Also,

170
00:08:55.173 --> 00:08:57.474
how are you so sure if I really am...

171
00:08:58.513 --> 00:08:59.974
a nobody to her...

172
00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:03.214
or if I'll become someone?

173
00:09:07.783 --> 00:09:08.854
I like that.

174
00:09:09.624 --> 00:09:11.293
You're optimistic.

175
00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:14.763
Good luck.

176
00:09:22.464 --> 00:09:25.004
Dong Moon, you're really something.

177
00:09:28.244 --> 00:09:31.574
When can I have a presence like him?

178
00:09:31.844 --> 00:09:34.084
No, you did well.

179
00:09:34.244 --> 00:09:35.744
Come here. Good job.

180
00:09:38.714 --> 00:09:39.854
Park Hae Joo's dad...

181
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.183
- is a communist? - Yes.

182
00:09:42.724 --> 00:09:46.124
As far as we know, he was a professor in Seoul.

183
00:09:46.124 --> 00:09:48.094
He's taking a year off for his break.

184
00:09:48.094 --> 00:09:51.163
It's not a break, he was fired.

185
00:09:51.334 --> 00:09:53.263
He commented on the current situation,

186
00:09:53.263 --> 00:09:55.763
and helped the students that protested.

187
00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:00.673
This is what happened.

188
00:10:01.543 --> 00:10:03.043
Write this down.

189
00:10:23.263 --> 00:10:24.334
Park Hae Joo.

190
00:10:26.234 --> 00:10:27.293
Park Hae Joo.

191
00:10:27.803 --> 00:10:28.903
Hey.

192
00:10:31.374 --> 00:10:32.403
Yes.

193
00:10:33.974 --> 00:10:35.374
Is your father doing well?

194
00:10:37.143 --> 00:10:38.214
Pardon?

195
00:10:44.454 --> 00:10:45.484
Yes.

196
00:10:57.933 --> 00:10:59.464
Did you watch the television yesterday?

197
00:10:59.464 --> 00:11:01.063
Yoon Seul was on.

198
00:11:01.334 --> 00:11:03.033
Of course I saw it.

199
00:11:03.234 --> 00:11:06.004
How can someone be so handsome?

200
00:11:06.334 --> 00:11:08.303
Wait. Hae Joo.

201
00:11:09.273 --> 00:11:10.943
You're on the day show today.

202
00:11:11.173 --> 00:11:12.643
You have to eat your lunch fast.

203
00:11:16.683 --> 00:11:18.714
- That's right. - What about lunch?

204
00:11:19.183 --> 00:11:20.454
I don't feel like eating.

205
00:11:26.224 --> 00:11:27.293
Ki Ryuh.

206
00:11:27.763 --> 00:11:29.693
This is all I could bring.

207
00:11:30.933 --> 00:11:32.933
- I'm sorry. - Thank you.

208
00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:38.773
She doesn't pack lunch these days.

209
00:11:39.974 --> 00:11:41.303
She brings me this.

210
00:11:41.303 --> 00:11:42.403
Why not?

211
00:11:42.704 --> 00:11:43.803
I don't know.

212
00:11:45.074 --> 00:11:46.714
She must have a lot on her mind.

213
00:11:47.744 --> 00:11:49.643
JHBS.

214
00:11:49.643 --> 00:11:52.013
Jeonghyeon Girls High broadcasting service.

215
00:11:52.013 --> 00:11:54.023
We'll now begin our day show.

216
00:11:54.224 --> 00:11:56.624
Hello, fellow students.

217
00:11:56.724 --> 00:11:58.724
- Nice. - Long time no see.

218
00:11:59.224 --> 00:12:01.594
- Did you hear a magpie... - I have a favor to ask.

219
00:12:01.594 --> 00:12:04.594
Cry on your way to school today?

220
00:12:04.594 --> 00:12:06.494
I don't know him.

221
00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.734
They say it means the one you're waiting for...

222
00:12:09.734 --> 00:12:12.234
- will come back. - If you see him...

223
00:12:12.734 --> 00:12:15.704
I hope the person you're waiting for...

224
00:12:20.543 --> 00:12:22.813
will come back too.

225
00:12:24.313 --> 00:12:26.484
I'll play the first song.

226
00:12:27.254 --> 00:12:30.053
Paul Anka's "Papa".

227
00:12:38.364 --> 00:12:41.604
Hae Joo, that man will stay with us.

228
00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.903
You can't tell anyone about it.

229
00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:02.183
I'm okay.

230
00:13:04.824 --> 00:13:05.893
Let's eat.

231
00:13:06.523 --> 00:13:08.193
I haven't eaten yet either.

232
00:13:26.043 --> 00:13:28.614
Did something happen at home?

233
00:13:36.824 --> 00:13:37.854
This is good.

234
00:13:38.854 --> 00:13:41.393
- Thank you. - Don't lie.

235
00:13:42.063 --> 00:13:43.964
You're hardly eating anything.

236
00:13:58.244 --> 00:14:00.114
Please give me a box of pads.

237
00:14:07.354 --> 00:14:09.783
Did Hae Joo eat your lunch?

238
00:14:11.693 --> 00:14:14.964
She picked on it. She didn't want to eat.

239
00:14:15.763 --> 00:14:17.494
She wouldn't tell me what's going on.

240
00:14:18.063 --> 00:14:20.263
Could it be because of Jin?

241
00:14:21.004 --> 00:14:22.263
It's not like that.

242
00:14:34.643 --> 00:14:36.643
Eng Cho, let's do a good job.

243
00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:38.053
Don't worry.

244
00:14:38.714 --> 00:14:40.114
You're so cute.

245
00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:41.824
Go in.

246
00:14:44.193 --> 00:14:46.553
Hey, sister. It's me.

247
00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.923
Hae Joo. Hae Joo.

248
00:14:55.834 --> 00:14:57.063
Eng Cho.

249
00:14:58.134 --> 00:14:59.374
Have you been well?

250
00:14:59.834 --> 00:15:03.903
Hae Joo, do you have any food at home?

251
00:15:04.614 --> 00:15:06.874
Did you skip your meal?

252
00:15:09.043 --> 00:15:11.053
Young Choon...

253
00:15:11.053 --> 00:15:14.153
is too busy to make me food.

254
00:15:14.754 --> 00:15:15.754
Is that so?

255
00:15:25.563 --> 00:15:28.004
Let's go inside. I'll make you food.

256
00:15:28.263 --> 00:15:29.263
Okay.

257
00:15:31.574 --> 00:15:32.574
Good luck.

258
00:15:41.484 --> 00:15:43.043
Enjoy.

259
00:15:44.653 --> 00:15:45.813
No.

260
00:15:46.013 --> 00:15:49.153
If you won't eat, I won't eat either.

261
00:15:50.124 --> 00:15:53.354
Let's take turns having a spoonful.

262
00:15:53.693 --> 00:15:54.893
Okay?

263
00:15:57.124 --> 00:15:59.334
Is that what Young Choon told you to do?

264
00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:00.334
Yes.

265
00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:05.673
Fine.

266
00:16:07.474 --> 00:16:08.773
I'll have a bite first.

267
00:16:17.043 --> 00:16:18.153
One for you.

268
00:16:24.624 --> 00:16:25.624
Is it good?

269
00:16:25.824 --> 00:16:26.824
Yes.

270
00:16:44.443 --> 00:16:46.074
What's the use?

271
00:16:47.513 --> 00:16:48.744
I'm only agonized.

272
00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:53.114
It was only a dream.

273
00:16:57.994 --> 00:17:00.393
Mom, can't you knock?

274
00:17:06.433 --> 00:17:07.463
What?

275
00:17:07.463 --> 00:17:09.304
Why aren't you going out to study...

276
00:17:09.304 --> 00:17:10.733
dressed like you're a guy?

277
00:17:12.534 --> 00:17:14.243
I told you I won't go.

278
00:17:14.844 --> 00:17:16.673
How can I go to a study room?

279
00:17:22.443 --> 00:17:23.514
Go.

280
00:17:29.223 --> 00:17:30.354
It's okay.

281
00:17:30.524 --> 00:17:32.453
I don't want Dad to beat me.

282
00:17:32.824 --> 00:17:34.824
I'll get beat instead of you.

283
00:17:35.893 --> 00:17:38.733
If you talked back to your Dad,

284
00:17:38.733 --> 00:17:41.034
then show him some results.

285
00:17:41.034 --> 00:17:43.764
However, don't stay up all night.

286
00:17:44.074 --> 00:17:46.274
Come back before curfew with Bong Soo.

287
00:17:47.134 --> 00:17:49.274
How can a girl stay out all night?

288
00:17:52.114 --> 00:17:54.844
Hey, pack some snacks for Jung Hee!

289
00:17:55.614 --> 00:17:57.514
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:14.264
(Study Room)

291
00:18:18.173 --> 00:18:19.334
Right, it's not this way.

292
00:18:21.903 --> 00:18:22.903
Jung Hee.

293
00:18:24.874 --> 00:18:25.874
Jin.

294
00:18:27.884 --> 00:18:30.284
Are you not studying here tonight?

295
00:18:32.384 --> 00:18:35.183
I just registered for the girls' room.

296
00:18:35.784 --> 00:18:36.784
Did you?

297
00:18:38.524 --> 00:18:41.824
Come see me on the roof in about two hours.

298
00:18:41.824 --> 00:18:44.264
- Pardon? - I have something.

299
00:18:45.364 --> 00:18:46.364
Okay.

300
00:18:51.774 --> 00:18:53.473
Jung Hee,

301
00:18:53.804 --> 00:18:55.874
don't be so easily swayed.

302
00:19:08.753 --> 00:19:10.284
Two hours later?

303
00:19:27.673 --> 00:19:29.203
(Two hours later)

304
00:19:29.203 --> 00:19:30.844
Two hours later, rooftop.

305
00:19:30.844 --> 00:19:32.713
Jin and Jung Hee will meet.

306
00:19:44.554 --> 00:19:45.624
Here you go.

307
00:19:45.624 --> 00:19:46.854
Have a good night.

308
00:19:47.824 --> 00:19:49.324
- Take care. - Goodnight.

309
00:19:49.324 --> 00:19:50.324
Bye.

310
00:19:53.864 --> 00:19:55.104
Thank you.

311
00:19:59.604 --> 00:20:00.604
Eng Cho.

312
00:20:01.243 --> 00:20:02.703
She wouldn't know even if she was kidnapped.

313
00:20:03.643 --> 00:20:04.844
Let her sleep.

314
00:20:05.774 --> 00:20:07.884
Give her to me. I'll put her in the room.

315
00:20:09.814 --> 00:20:10.884
Eng Cho.

316
00:20:17.453 --> 00:20:18.524
Hey...

317
00:20:19.824 --> 00:20:22.993
My friend runs a pool hall near the university.

318
00:20:24.233 --> 00:20:25.794
I asked him...

319
00:20:26.534 --> 00:20:27.903
to look for your father.

320
00:20:28.834 --> 00:20:30.804
Thank you, mister...

321
00:20:32.973 --> 00:20:34.104
Thank you.

322
00:20:34.874 --> 00:20:36.143
Don't thank me.

323
00:20:36.774 --> 00:20:37.943
I didn't do anything.

324
00:20:45.653 --> 00:20:46.753
Have this.

325
00:20:46.953 --> 00:20:48.453
I'm all right.

326
00:20:48.884 --> 00:20:50.653
Have it. I already opened it.

327
00:20:55.493 --> 00:20:56.493
Okay.

328
00:21:08.374 --> 00:21:09.643
Gosh.

329
00:21:19.014 --> 00:21:20.114
You should be careful.

330
00:21:35.233 --> 00:21:36.233
Here.

331
00:21:38.703 --> 00:21:41.044
This is the sample test for juniors.

332
00:21:42.074 --> 00:21:43.104
Did you...

333
00:21:43.903 --> 00:21:46.344
bring this for me on purpose?

334
00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:47.514
Yes.

335
00:21:48.084 --> 00:21:49.384
I'm not sure if it'll be helpful...

336
00:21:49.943 --> 00:21:51.413
since we go to different schools.

337
00:21:54.483 --> 00:21:55.624
Thank you.

338
00:21:55.624 --> 00:21:56.884
If you have any questions,

339
00:21:57.054 --> 00:21:58.354
you can always ask me.

340
00:21:59.153 --> 00:22:00.253
Jin.

341
00:22:02.094 --> 00:22:04.393
- Why are you here? - I registered too.

342
00:22:04.393 --> 00:22:06.163
Jin, I have a question.

343
00:22:06.163 --> 00:22:07.733
Can I ask you?

344
00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:11.233
This is X.

345
00:22:12.003 --> 00:22:13.203
If this happens,

346
00:22:14.044 --> 00:22:15.044
Y equals...

347
00:22:16.374 --> 00:22:17.374
Wait.

348
00:22:21.413 --> 00:22:23.044
Something looks wrong.

349
00:22:23.243 --> 00:22:25.314
Maybe this workbook has an error.

350
00:22:26.084 --> 00:22:28.824
You must be right. It's probably an error.

351
00:22:32.124 --> 00:22:35.294
Right. Maybe we should go like this.

352
00:22:35.923 --> 00:22:38.534
This is not X.

353
00:22:38.534 --> 00:22:41.203
Take it like this, so Y....

354
00:22:41.634 --> 00:22:44.403
It's either 0 or 3.

355
00:22:44.403 --> 00:22:45.673
You solved it.

356
00:22:46.134 --> 00:22:48.304
Wow, Dong Moon.

357
00:22:57.814 --> 00:22:58.983
- Dong Moon. - Yes?

358
00:22:59.054 --> 00:23:00.854
Does it feel good to make a fool of me?

359
00:23:02.554 --> 00:23:04.653
Yes. It feels good.

360
00:23:04.653 --> 00:23:06.054
Hey.

361
00:23:15.034 --> 00:23:16.034
All right.

362
00:23:16.403 --> 00:23:18.473
Today is the day.

363
00:23:18.574 --> 00:23:19.703
Keep your eyes wide open,

364
00:23:20.034 --> 00:23:23.203
and give it your best to answer the questions.

365
00:23:23.203 --> 00:23:24.814
Ready, start.

366
00:23:35.153 --> 00:23:38.393
Hae Joo? Isn't she the one that came from Seoul...

367
00:23:38.393 --> 00:23:40.124
and came over to our place?

368
00:23:40.124 --> 00:23:42.564
That's her. She's pretty.

369
00:23:42.564 --> 00:23:46.663
And she's getting on with Young Choon?

370
00:23:46.663 --> 00:23:50.163
Yes. I saw them talk in his pharmacy.

371
00:23:50.163 --> 00:23:52.173
I saw it with my own eyes.

372
00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:54.344
No way.

373
00:23:54.344 --> 00:23:56.774
Young Choon has a sister named Eng Cho, right?

374
00:23:56.774 --> 00:23:58.743
Hae Joo brought her...

375
00:23:59.413 --> 00:24:00.844
on her back like this.

376
00:24:00.844 --> 00:24:02.014
They are so in love.

377
00:24:02.014 --> 00:24:03.544
Keep on rolling my hair.

378
00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:06.114
They say it's always the quiet ones...

379
00:24:06.114 --> 00:24:08.183
that make trouble.

380
00:24:10.554 --> 00:24:12.693
Jung Hee, are you going out to study?

381
00:24:12.893 --> 00:24:13.893
Yes.

382
00:24:13.993 --> 00:24:15.193
Jung Hee.

383
00:24:16.064 --> 00:24:17.064
What?

384
00:24:17.064 --> 00:24:20.834
Don't hang out with Hae Joo anymore.

385
00:24:20.834 --> 00:24:22.604
She's dating Young Choon.

386
00:24:22.604 --> 00:24:23.963
It's not like that.

387
00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:25.604
Young Choon's sister, Eng Cho,

388
00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:27.443
seems to like Hae Joo.

389
00:24:27.673 --> 00:24:30.143
- Hae Joo is so nice. - Gibberish.

390
00:24:30.574 --> 00:24:33.274
You need to be careful of the nice girls.

391
00:24:33.614 --> 00:24:35.983
Nice and pretty girls...

392
00:24:35.983 --> 00:24:39.854
go around stealing other people's husbands.

393
00:24:41.223 --> 00:24:43.453
- That's not right. - It's true.

394
00:24:43.554 --> 00:24:47.024
Then Auntie must've stolen hundreds of husbands.

395
00:24:47.193 --> 00:24:49.764
She's pretty and nice.

396
00:24:50.663 --> 00:24:52.693
- I'm not nice. - Regardless,

397
00:24:52.794 --> 00:24:54.264
Hae Joo isn't like that.

398
00:24:54.304 --> 00:24:55.963
Don't go around saying that.

399
00:24:55.963 --> 00:24:58.774
"Don't go around"? Am I your friend?

400
00:24:59.374 --> 00:25:00.743
What gibberish.

401
00:25:08.943 --> 00:25:11.683
Don't hang out with that girl Hae Joo.

402
00:25:11.784 --> 00:25:14.183
I hear she's dating Young Choon.

403
00:25:14.953 --> 00:25:17.753
Stupid. Just what did she do?

404
00:25:38.213 --> 00:25:39.243
Hae Joo.

405
00:25:46.084 --> 00:25:47.114
Hae Joo.

406
00:25:49.284 --> 00:25:50.794
- Jung Hee. - Is...

407
00:25:51.554 --> 00:25:52.893
something wrong?

408
00:25:54.193 --> 00:25:56.423
Your father hasn't come home?

409
00:25:57.294 --> 00:25:58.893
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

410
00:26:00.493 --> 00:26:02.463
I just couldn't.

411
00:26:04.374 --> 00:26:05.473
Jung Hee.

412
00:26:06.134 --> 00:26:07.403
You can't...

413
00:26:08.203 --> 00:26:11.143
tell anyone about this, okay?

414
00:26:23.653 --> 00:26:24.893
What do I do?

415
00:26:26.393 --> 00:26:27.423
Jung Hee.

416
00:26:31.693 --> 00:26:32.794
Jin.

417
00:26:32.993 --> 00:26:34.304
Is something wrong?

418
00:26:35.963 --> 00:26:37.134
What is it?

419
00:26:41.173 --> 00:26:42.173
Well...

420
00:26:46.344 --> 00:26:47.913
Hae Joo's father?

421
00:26:48.314 --> 00:26:52.114
I heard your father was the chief of police.

422
00:26:53.554 --> 00:26:55.024
I was wondering...

423
00:26:55.483 --> 00:26:57.753
if he could help.

424
00:27:01.223 --> 00:27:03.094
Yes, sure.

425
00:27:04.064 --> 00:27:05.364
I'll ask.

426
00:27:06.233 --> 00:27:09.163
You can't tell anyone else about this,

427
00:27:10.034 --> 00:27:11.473
- okay? - Okay.

428
00:27:12.134 --> 00:27:15.374
You have to keep it a secret too.

429
00:27:16.074 --> 00:27:17.203
Okay.

430
00:27:18.814 --> 00:27:22.084
I thought that was the best thing back then.

431
00:27:23.584 --> 00:27:26.284
I was just slightly uncomfortable...

432
00:27:26.554 --> 00:27:30.124
that Jin and Hae Joo may see each other again...

433
00:27:30.453 --> 00:27:32.393
because of this.

434
00:27:36.893 --> 00:27:37.893
Jung Hee.

435
00:27:38.864 --> 00:27:39.993
Aren't you going to study?

436
00:27:40.764 --> 00:27:42.534
- What? - Is something wrong?

437
00:27:43.963 --> 00:27:45.173
Did you bomb your test?

438
00:27:48.203 --> 00:27:49.743
It'll be fine, right?

439
00:27:50.143 --> 00:27:52.114
What? What will?

440
00:27:54.143 --> 00:27:55.243
Nothing.

441
00:27:56.514 --> 00:27:57.683
You did well.

442
00:27:58.354 --> 00:28:00.384
You don't even know what it is.

443
00:28:00.514 --> 00:28:03.354
Anything you do is good.

444
00:28:04.354 --> 00:28:07.364
You did a good job, Lee Jung Hee.

445
00:28:12.733 --> 00:28:14.134
Yes, hello?

446
00:28:14.534 --> 00:28:16.463
Yes. Young Choon?

447
00:28:16.903 --> 00:28:18.074
Just a minute.

448
00:28:18.203 --> 00:28:19.874
- Is that for me? - Here.

449
00:28:21.703 --> 00:28:22.804
Hello?

450
00:28:23.844 --> 00:28:25.143
Yes.

451
00:28:27.274 --> 00:28:28.284
What?

452
00:28:32.554 --> 00:28:33.983
Where are you going?

453
00:28:36.084 --> 00:28:39.653
What? Park Jin Soo was released?

454
00:28:40.554 --> 00:28:42.193
- When? - Park Jin Soo.

455
00:28:44.034 --> 00:28:46.193
- Hae Joo's father? - And his guilt?

456
00:28:46.963 --> 00:28:48.034
What? Not guilty?

457
00:28:48.834 --> 00:28:51.473
How could he be not guilty?

458
00:29:09.054 --> 00:29:10.483
I had no idea.

459
00:29:11.453 --> 00:29:12.554
I didn't know...

460
00:29:13.423 --> 00:29:15.223
Hae Joo was having such a hard time.

461
00:29:21.733 --> 00:29:22.804
Hae Joo.

462
00:29:37.554 --> 00:29:39.483
- Which way? - Over here.

463
00:29:50.564 --> 00:29:51.663
Can you hold him?

464
00:29:55.534 --> 00:29:56.634
Dad.

465
00:29:58.074 --> 00:29:59.104
Dad.

466
00:30:00.274 --> 00:30:02.274
What happened?

467
00:30:03.874 --> 00:30:05.443
He was passed out...

468
00:30:06.814 --> 00:30:08.243
at the bus terminal.

469
00:30:10.143 --> 00:30:11.554
Dad.

470
00:30:19.578 --> 00:30:22.810

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

471
00:30:30.403 --> 00:30:31.673
Jin.

472
00:30:34.574 --> 00:30:35.703
Jung Hee.

473
00:30:38.443 --> 00:30:39.574
Are you heading home?

474
00:30:43.544 --> 00:30:44.554
Yes.

475
00:30:48.253 --> 00:30:51.024
Hae Joo's father came back.

476
00:30:51.094 --> 00:30:52.193
He did?

477
00:30:53.324 --> 00:30:55.493
Because you helped...

478
00:30:57.463 --> 00:30:58.463
No.

479
00:30:59.364 --> 00:31:00.433
I...

480
00:31:01.864 --> 00:31:03.634
couldn't help at all.

481
00:31:09.844 --> 00:31:10.973
That's right.

482
00:31:11.673 --> 00:31:13.143
Jin...

483
00:31:13.673 --> 00:31:16.443
still liked Hae Joo.

484
00:31:17.683 --> 00:31:20.983
Just as I still liked him.

485
00:31:42.804 --> 00:31:44.743
Good job, everyone.

486
00:31:53.284 --> 00:31:55.024
Exams are finally over.

487
00:31:55.024 --> 00:31:56.554
Freedom!

488
00:31:56.884 --> 00:31:59.094
Should we go watch a movie today?

489
00:31:59.223 --> 00:32:01.864
Sounds good. Jung Hee, go with us.

490
00:32:02.163 --> 00:32:03.993
No. I want to rest.

491
00:32:04.764 --> 00:32:05.963
Brat.

492
00:32:06.134 --> 00:32:07.933
You stayed up all night again, didn't you?

493
00:32:08.304 --> 00:32:11.003
You'll become the top student at that rate.

494
00:32:12.774 --> 00:32:15.173
What? Hae Joo is the top student.

495
00:32:15.673 --> 00:32:16.743
Look.

496
00:32:16.844 --> 00:32:20.044
She's exhausted from studying all night.

497
00:32:21.183 --> 00:32:22.943
She didn't study all night.

498
00:32:24.653 --> 00:32:27.624
This morning, my mom saw...

499
00:32:27.854 --> 00:32:30.893
Young Choon leave Hae Joo's house.

500
00:32:31.923 --> 00:32:33.024
Really?

501
00:32:33.153 --> 00:32:34.794
What do you mean?

502
00:32:35.223 --> 00:32:37.834
Hey. Get your mom glasses.

503
00:32:37.834 --> 00:32:40.034
No, it's true.

504
00:32:40.034 --> 00:32:41.933
- It is not. - It is too.

505
00:32:44.534 --> 00:32:46.074
This is better.

506
00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:47.844
This is number two.

507
00:32:58.554 --> 00:33:00.483
- Hae Joo. - Hey.

508
00:33:01.453 --> 00:33:02.784
Did you do well on the exam?

509
00:33:03.084 --> 00:33:05.253
Yes. Sort of.

510
00:33:07.193 --> 00:33:10.624
My dad came home.

511
00:33:12.693 --> 00:33:15.034
Really? That's great.

512
00:33:15.534 --> 00:33:16.804
That's really great.

513
00:33:20.003 --> 00:33:21.003
What?

514
00:33:21.703 --> 00:33:24.443
Is something else wrong?

515
00:33:29.243 --> 00:33:30.284
No.

516
00:33:31.554 --> 00:33:33.614
Thanks for worrying.

517
00:33:46.933 --> 00:33:48.634
- A thug? - Yes.

518
00:33:50.604 --> 00:33:53.933
Every thug in Daegu knows Young Choon.

519
00:33:54.604 --> 00:33:56.673
That little scumbag.

520
00:33:56.673 --> 00:33:57.713
I know!

521
00:33:58.114 --> 00:33:59.443
That isn't all.

522
00:33:59.443 --> 00:34:02.514
You know that little girl, supposedly his sister?

523
00:34:02.643 --> 00:34:05.153
- Yes. - That kid...

524
00:34:09.253 --> 00:34:11.454
- What is it? - They say she's his kid.

525
00:34:16.864 --> 00:34:18.034
Hello.

526
00:34:24.804 --> 00:34:25.804
You know me, right?

527
00:34:28.204 --> 00:34:29.443
I know...

528
00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:31.474
you helped Hae Joo.

529
00:34:33.744 --> 00:34:34.884
Thank you.

530
00:34:35.644 --> 00:34:38.284
But I'd like you to be more careful...

531
00:34:38.384 --> 00:34:40.153
about what people may think.

532
00:34:41.023 --> 00:34:42.184
What people may think?

533
00:34:48.963 --> 00:34:50.264
Not what you think?

534
00:34:53.364 --> 00:34:54.563
- That's not it. - I hear...

535
00:34:54.563 --> 00:34:56.164
you're the police chief's son.

536
00:34:58.733 --> 00:35:00.574
Can the police chief's son...

537
00:35:00.943 --> 00:35:02.704
meet with a thug like me...

538
00:35:03.844 --> 00:35:05.273
in public like this?

539
00:35:06.614 --> 00:35:07.614
Can you?

540
00:35:12.284 --> 00:35:13.983
So many people can see.

541
00:35:21.123 --> 00:35:22.224
Hey, kid.

542
00:35:23.123 --> 00:35:25.563
Don't act tough in front of me,

543
00:35:26.293 --> 00:35:27.903
and go home and study.

544
00:35:50.054 --> 00:35:51.054
Hae Joo.

545
00:35:52.193 --> 00:35:54.824
I hear Young Choon is a thug.

546
00:35:54.824 --> 00:35:55.824
He hangs out with...

547
00:35:55.824 --> 00:35:57.934
Young Choon isn't like that.

548
00:35:59.463 --> 00:36:00.733
He helped me a lot...

549
00:36:01.463 --> 00:36:02.764
when things were tough for me.

550
00:36:03.634 --> 00:36:04.773
That's because...

551
00:36:05.173 --> 00:36:06.503
he had bad intentions toward you.

552
00:36:06.503 --> 00:36:07.844
He really...

553
00:36:08.603 --> 00:36:09.744
isn't like that.

554
00:36:15.144 --> 00:36:16.384
He is...

555
00:36:17.514 --> 00:36:18.583
a good person.

556
00:36:26.123 --> 00:36:27.253
I really...

557
00:36:29.264 --> 00:36:31.094
mean nothing to you...

558
00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:34.403
even now.

559
00:36:53.313 --> 00:36:54.454
- Father. - You.

560
00:36:55.123 --> 00:36:56.324
I told you...

561
00:36:56.353 --> 00:36:59.594
not to do anything to destroy my life!

562
00:37:00.324 --> 00:37:02.824
Why do you keep going to that communist's house?

563
00:37:02.864 --> 00:37:04.764
If you keep disobeying me,

564
00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:07.063
I can take extreme measures.

565
00:37:07.434 --> 00:37:08.534
Understand?

566
00:37:15.244 --> 00:37:17.744
We have the results of the midterms.

567
00:37:18.844 --> 00:37:21.244
I actually expected...

568
00:37:22.083 --> 00:37:23.684
great things from you.

569
00:37:23.884 --> 00:37:26.313
I was a stupid pig, a rat.

570
00:37:26.983 --> 00:37:31.094
Once again, our class, without fail,

571
00:37:31.724 --> 00:37:33.494
came in last.

572
00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:38.664
Funny, right, punk?

573
00:37:40.764 --> 00:37:42.534
There was one girl...

574
00:37:43.733 --> 00:37:47.574
who disappointed me like crazy.

575
00:37:47.574 --> 00:37:48.644
Her name is...

576
00:37:50.844 --> 00:37:52.574
Why you little...

577
00:37:56.083 --> 00:37:57.213
Hae Joo.

578
00:38:02.083 --> 00:38:03.483
- Hey, Hae Joo. - Yes?

579
00:38:03.483 --> 00:38:06.153
Did you cheat at your old school?

580
00:38:06.753 --> 00:38:08.793
How could the top scorer in the country...

581
00:38:08.793 --> 00:38:11.693
not make top 30 in this stupid class?

582
00:38:11.693 --> 00:38:12.693
- What? - What?

583
00:38:12.693 --> 00:38:14.503
- Really? - What?

584
00:38:14.503 --> 00:38:15.804
Oh, my gosh.

585
00:38:19.804 --> 00:38:20.844
There is...

586
00:38:22.844 --> 00:38:24.514
one person...

587
00:38:24.574 --> 00:38:27.744
who provided me a sliver of comfort.

588
00:38:27.744 --> 00:38:28.744
Her name is...

589
00:38:30.184 --> 00:38:31.184
Jung Hee.

590
00:38:34.954 --> 00:38:37.523
Jung Hee went up...

591
00:38:37.523 --> 00:38:39.724
a whopping 230 spots.

592
00:38:40.054 --> 00:38:42.994
And came in seventh in our class.

593
00:38:43.764 --> 00:38:45.764
- Wow. - Nice.

594
00:38:45.764 --> 00:38:46.764
Seriously...

595
00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:51.173
Anyway, you should give congratulations when due.

596
00:38:51.574 --> 00:38:54.103
Okay. Let's give Jung Hee a round of applause.

597
00:39:05.114 --> 00:39:06.114
What's this?

598
00:39:11.224 --> 00:39:13.793
Seventh? Seventh in your class?

599
00:39:15.224 --> 00:39:16.563
You brat.

600
00:39:16.563 --> 00:39:17.994
You faked this!

601
00:39:17.994 --> 00:39:20.864
I did not. Ask my homeroom teacher.

602
00:39:22.733 --> 00:39:23.864
Hey!

603
00:39:24.434 --> 00:39:26.733
Jung Hee came in seventh! Seventh!

604
00:39:26.733 --> 00:39:28.074
Oh my gosh!

605
00:39:28.304 --> 00:39:31.043
- Where? - Look here. Seventh.

606
00:39:32.244 --> 00:39:35.014
Jung Hee. You did great.

607
00:39:37.653 --> 00:39:38.684
What's this?

608
00:39:42.824 --> 00:39:44.523
Father, did you see?

609
00:39:44.824 --> 00:39:46.793
I can do well too.

610
00:39:48.623 --> 00:39:50.994
Bong Soo. What did you place?

611
00:39:53.434 --> 00:39:54.634
Tell me.

612
00:39:55.103 --> 00:39:58.233
The same as before.

613
00:39:58.534 --> 00:39:59.603
The same?

614
00:40:00.773 --> 00:40:02.173
Then 40...

615
00:40:02.273 --> 00:40:04.313
Why you little...

616
00:40:04.313 --> 00:40:07.384
Come on. Calm down.

617
00:40:07.384 --> 00:40:11.454
First, you should compliment Jung Hee.

618
00:40:11.454 --> 00:40:13.114
We never had...

619
00:40:13.114 --> 00:40:15.923
anyone who did this well in school before.

620
00:40:16.324 --> 00:40:19.293
You loser. You're worse than a girl.

621
00:40:19.594 --> 00:40:20.824
Darn it.

622
00:40:21.324 --> 00:40:22.394
Father!

623
00:40:23.623 --> 00:40:24.634
What?

624
00:40:24.634 --> 00:40:27.333
Why won't you compliment me?

625
00:40:27.563 --> 00:40:28.563
Good job.

626
00:40:29.233 --> 00:40:31.903
Wait. Since I did well,

627
00:40:32.704 --> 00:40:34.043
I want a gift.

628
00:40:34.103 --> 00:40:35.673
Don't be stupid.

629
00:40:35.673 --> 00:40:37.103
- Here, here. - Forget it.

630
00:40:37.103 --> 00:40:38.474
Not money.

631
00:40:39.074 --> 00:40:40.244
Then what?

632
00:40:40.983 --> 00:40:42.184
From now on,

633
00:40:42.784 --> 00:40:44.153
treat me the same...

634
00:40:44.483 --> 00:40:46.083
as Bong Soo.

635
00:40:47.824 --> 00:40:50.023
Instead of saying, "a girl' this,

636
00:40:50.623 --> 00:40:51.954
"a girl" that.

637
00:40:52.193 --> 00:40:54.523
Has this girl gone insane?

638
00:40:54.923 --> 00:40:57.833
You should feel bad for discouraging Bong Soo.

639
00:41:00.233 --> 00:41:01.603
Father!

640
00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:03.804
You brat.

641
00:41:03.804 --> 00:41:07.173
Why did you ruin it after working so hard?

642
00:41:07.173 --> 00:41:10.003
Here. Here. Take this.

643
00:41:11.773 --> 00:41:12.914
Take this!

644
00:41:12.914 --> 00:41:14.644
Shall I bring it to her?

645
00:41:15.114 --> 00:41:16.384
Shut it.

646
00:41:22.824 --> 00:41:27.123
(Rank 7 out of 64)

647
00:41:29.463 --> 00:41:30.463
I...

648
00:41:30.994 --> 00:41:33.434
really hate my father.

649
00:41:34.733 --> 00:41:36.364
I can't stand him.

650
00:41:41.574 --> 00:41:44.943
Does it hurt that much to compliment Jung Hee...

651
00:41:45.144 --> 00:41:46.673
for doing a good job?

652
00:41:48.213 --> 00:41:50.813
It's a given for a student to do well in school.

653
00:41:50.813 --> 00:41:52.583
If it were Bong Soo,

654
00:41:53.483 --> 00:41:55.483
you would've cooked an entire pig.

655
00:41:57.824 --> 00:41:59.753
There's no point in a girl doing well in school.

656
00:41:59.753 --> 00:42:01.494
It'll only make her life more difficult.

657
00:42:01.494 --> 00:42:02.894
Then what?

658
00:42:03.123 --> 00:42:06.333
Am I living it up because I didn't study?

659
00:42:08.304 --> 00:42:09.804
How dare you...

660
00:42:18.344 --> 00:42:19.543
Where are you going?

661
00:42:20.373 --> 00:42:22.014
I'm going to sleep...

662
00:42:22.014 --> 00:42:24.284
with the other witch with a cruddy life.

663
00:42:31.824 --> 00:42:33.423
Darn it.

664
00:42:38.664 --> 00:42:42.733
Why did she have to get her smarts from me?

665
00:42:45.074 --> 00:42:47.543
It's cramped.

666
00:42:47.543 --> 00:42:48.744
Jung Hee.

667
00:42:52.273 --> 00:42:54.213
Want some new clothes?

668
00:42:54.483 --> 00:42:55.914
A name brand?

669
00:42:56.684 --> 00:42:57.713
Really?

670
00:42:58.114 --> 00:42:59.753
Then buy me two.

671
00:42:59.853 --> 00:43:01.454
A t-shirt and a blouse.

672
00:43:02.184 --> 00:43:03.994
Get just one, you brat.

673
00:43:10.324 --> 00:43:11.494
You did well.

674
00:43:14.463 --> 00:43:16.903
You didn't get much milk when you were a baby...

675
00:43:16.963 --> 00:43:18.634
because of your brother,

676
00:43:18.634 --> 00:43:20.373
and were always weak.

677
00:43:20.503 --> 00:43:24.344
I wondered if you'd survive in this world.

678
00:43:24.344 --> 00:43:25.914
You did well.

679
00:43:29.213 --> 00:43:30.753
Good night.

680
00:43:34.284 --> 00:43:35.554
Mom.

681
00:43:35.853 --> 00:43:36.923
What?

682
00:43:36.923 --> 00:43:38.753
Give me my milk now.

683
00:43:38.753 --> 00:43:40.523
Are you insane?

684
00:43:40.523 --> 00:43:42.264
You're all grown up. Hey!

685
00:43:42.264 --> 00:43:43.394
- I want my milk. - Let go!

686
00:43:43.394 --> 00:43:45.364
Have you lost your mind? That tickles.

687
00:44:05.983 --> 00:44:07.213
Straps?

688
00:44:07.983 --> 00:44:09.284
It's my gift to you...

689
00:44:09.523 --> 00:44:11.054
for doing well on your exams.

690
00:44:11.423 --> 00:44:13.853
Auntie. How did you know it was my dream...

691
00:44:13.853 --> 00:44:15.563
to wear a strappy undershirt?

692
00:44:16.364 --> 00:44:17.463
Do you like it?

693
00:44:18.034 --> 00:44:19.764
It's super pretty.

694
00:44:20.463 --> 00:44:21.864
Auntie!

695
00:44:26.034 --> 00:44:29.773
The police sent us this notice.

696
00:44:30.003 --> 00:44:31.773
Sir.

697
00:44:33.074 --> 00:44:34.644
Even if Hae Joo's father...

698
00:44:34.914 --> 00:44:36.744
commit an act of communism...

699
00:44:36.744 --> 00:44:39.014
Not "even if". It's the truth.

700
00:44:43.353 --> 00:44:46.793
Regardless, that's an adult matter.

701
00:44:47.224 --> 00:44:48.693
What do the kids know?

702
00:44:48.693 --> 00:44:50.094
Mr. Oh.

703
00:44:50.963 --> 00:44:53.833
Don't you watch the news about North Korea?

704
00:44:54.034 --> 00:44:57.233
Communism seeps through adults and children...

705
00:44:57.233 --> 00:45:00.704
and dyes them all red without discrimination.

706
00:45:00.903 --> 00:45:02.103
So,

707
00:45:02.574 --> 00:45:05.673
you must record everything Hae Joo does...

708
00:45:05.673 --> 00:45:08.684
and report them to me from now on.

709
00:45:08.943 --> 00:45:10.043
Understand?

710
00:45:26.264 --> 00:45:28.434
Jung Hee. Hae Joo.

711
00:45:28.934 --> 00:45:30.833
Gwi Ja. Sit down.

712
00:45:32.204 --> 00:45:34.244
The rest of you, take the position.

713
00:45:34.804 --> 00:45:36.574
Hold the chalk and take the position.

714
00:45:37.173 --> 00:45:40.474
You agreed not to give that punishment anymore.

715
00:45:41.483 --> 00:45:42.583
Positions.

716
00:45:42.644 --> 00:45:44.284
- Mr. Oh. - Positions!

717
00:45:53.753 --> 00:45:54.864
Okay.

718
00:45:55.963 --> 00:45:57.193
Ready?

719
00:45:58.594 --> 00:45:59.664
Mr. Oh.

720
00:46:05.474 --> 00:46:08.903
You promised not to do this.

721
00:46:15.313 --> 00:46:16.713
When did I do that?

722
00:46:17.284 --> 00:46:19.114
You demanded it of me.

723
00:46:19.114 --> 00:46:20.824
But you said you wouldn't do it.

724
00:46:21.284 --> 00:46:24.623
- You agreed... - I had said I wouldn't,

725
00:46:25.623 --> 00:46:28.293
but I have decided to do it again.

726
00:46:29.994 --> 00:46:31.764
To you guys...

727
00:46:32.833 --> 00:46:36.003
who maintained last place on the midterms,

728
00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:37.603
this is the only solution.

729
00:46:43.603 --> 00:46:45.474
Okay. Get ready.

730
00:46:45.713 --> 00:46:46.744
Mr. Oh.

731
00:46:48.483 --> 00:46:51.983
But still, this punishment is wrong.

732
00:47:00.894 --> 00:47:01.963
Wrong?

733
00:47:03.023 --> 00:47:06.693
It's not like you're being punished.

734
00:47:07.534 --> 00:47:08.704
Why do you care so much?

735
00:47:09.103 --> 00:47:11.003
I may not be the one being punished,

736
00:47:11.574 --> 00:47:14.304
but seeing my friends receive such unjust...

737
00:47:14.304 --> 00:47:15.943
Just do it already.

738
00:47:20.144 --> 00:47:21.483
Ae Sook, sit down.

739
00:47:24.184 --> 00:47:25.813
The rest of you too. Sit down.

740
00:47:37.994 --> 00:47:39.534
Then today,

741
00:47:40.664 --> 00:47:42.264
your Joan of Arc,

742
00:47:43.204 --> 00:47:46.273
Hae Joo, will receive the punishment instead.

743
00:47:47.673 --> 00:47:48.804
Step forward.

744
00:47:49.673 --> 00:47:50.974
Step forward now!

745
00:47:58.983 --> 00:48:01.583
I will take the punishment on their behalf.

746
00:48:02.184 --> 00:48:03.224
However,

747
00:48:04.193 --> 00:48:06.653
I refuse that punishment method.

748
00:48:08.994 --> 00:48:10.094
You do?

749
00:48:11.534 --> 00:48:14.364
Then will you receive any other method...

750
00:48:14.903 --> 00:48:16.063
gladly?

751
00:48:17.134 --> 00:48:18.273
Yes.

752
00:48:18.603 --> 00:48:19.634
Fine.

753
00:48:20.903 --> 00:48:22.003
Then...

754
00:48:23.204 --> 00:48:26.014
in exchange for the ones who should've...

755
00:48:26.713 --> 00:48:28.284
been punished today,

756
00:48:28.943 --> 00:48:30.184
as well as...

757
00:48:30.784 --> 00:48:33.083
for the ones who will deserve...

758
00:48:33.114 --> 00:48:34.923
the punishment going forward,

759
00:48:35.623 --> 00:48:38.153
Hae Joo will take 100 laps...

760
00:48:38.153 --> 00:48:39.454
around the yard.

761
00:48:40.724 --> 00:48:41.764
Go now!

762
00:48:43.193 --> 00:48:44.233
Mr. Oh.

763
00:48:46.434 --> 00:48:48.434
It's raining out.

764
00:48:48.603 --> 00:48:50.463
So what if it's raining?

765
00:48:51.704 --> 00:48:54.204
Do you want to run with Hae Joo?

766
00:48:55.003 --> 00:48:56.273
Anyone else?

767
00:48:56.673 --> 00:48:58.914
Anyone who agrees with Hae Joo...

768
00:48:59.213 --> 00:49:02.344
may go run with her right now!

769
00:49:03.213 --> 00:49:04.253
Anyone?

770
00:49:14.563 --> 00:49:15.563
See that?

771
00:49:17.293 --> 00:49:19.864
This is why you should know your place.

772
00:49:21.364 --> 00:49:24.403
You talk about humiliation and insult...

773
00:49:24.974 --> 00:49:27.603
to try to help these pigs here,

774
00:49:28.744 --> 00:49:32.173
but they aren't grateful to you one bit.

775
00:49:33.943 --> 00:49:35.844
This is how the world works.

776
00:49:39.914 --> 00:49:41.554
Go to the school yard now.

777
00:49:43.623 --> 00:49:44.853
Go right now!

778
00:49:56.903 --> 00:49:58.034
Mr. Oh.

779
00:49:59.873 --> 00:50:01.844
Okay. Page 63.

780
00:50:02.173 --> 00:50:03.244
Mr. Oh!

781
00:50:04.644 --> 00:50:07.514
Yes, Jung Hee. Do you have a question?

782
00:50:08.244 --> 00:50:09.914
My goodness.

783
00:50:10.414 --> 00:50:11.914
Jung Hee...

784
00:50:12.414 --> 00:50:14.954
finally became interested in studying.

785
00:50:15.153 --> 00:50:17.554
This is great. What is it?

786
00:50:17.793 --> 00:50:18.824
I'll...

787
00:50:20.094 --> 00:50:21.523
go with her.

788
00:50:23.963 --> 00:50:25.094
Where?

789
00:50:25.534 --> 00:50:27.293
Jung Hee. What are you doing?

790
00:50:29.364 --> 00:50:31.434
Jung Hee. Hey.

791
00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:34.443
Hey, Jung Hee. Jung Hee!

792
00:50:36.003 --> 00:50:37.173
Jung Hee!

793
00:50:50.954 --> 00:50:52.454
Why did you come after me?

794
00:50:53.554 --> 00:50:55.123
I didn't come after you.

795
00:50:55.963 --> 00:50:57.463
I came out because...

796
00:50:58.394 --> 00:51:00.333
I couldn't agree with Mr. Oh.

797
00:51:12.414 --> 00:51:15.614
I had hated Hae Joo again.

798
00:51:24.193 --> 00:51:27.523
I couldn't receive Jin's love...

799
00:51:27.764 --> 00:51:29.664
no matter what I did,

800
00:51:30.664 --> 00:51:33.134
but Hae Joo had it,

801
00:51:33.894 --> 00:51:35.063
so I hate her.

802
00:51:42.543 --> 00:51:43.773
However,

803
00:51:44.213 --> 00:51:46.813
I couldn't watch her...

804
00:51:50.144 --> 00:51:51.983
fight by herself.

805
00:51:55.853 --> 00:51:59.193
I have no idea why.

806
00:52:49.244 --> 00:52:50.373
Did you finish?

807
00:52:50.773 --> 00:52:51.844
Yes.

808
00:52:53.914 --> 00:52:55.213
You may go home.

809
00:53:20.773 --> 00:53:23.903
I heard you were punished.

810
00:53:27.614 --> 00:53:28.744
Why are you here?

811
00:53:29.514 --> 00:53:30.784
It's embarrassing.

812
00:53:44.434 --> 00:53:45.463
Let's go.

813
00:53:46.034 --> 00:53:47.503
You want me to use it by myself?

814
00:53:47.634 --> 00:53:51.034
What if a teacher sees us using it together?

815
00:53:52.673 --> 00:53:53.773
Let's go.

816
00:54:00.983 --> 00:54:02.213
Share it with me.

817
00:54:04.284 --> 00:54:07.083
If I get caught, I'll just be punished again.

818
00:54:08.224 --> 00:54:09.653
I'm not scared one bit.

819
00:54:17.394 --> 00:54:18.534
Okay.

820
00:54:19.664 --> 00:54:20.804
Let's go.

821
00:54:49.293 --> 00:54:50.394
Jung Hee.

822
00:54:50.423 --> 00:54:52.664
I meant to pick you up.

823
00:54:54.034 --> 00:54:56.304
You'll catch a cold. Take a shower.

824
00:54:58.434 --> 00:55:00.503
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

825
00:55:01.144 --> 00:55:02.173
No.

826
00:55:02.673 --> 00:55:03.744
Oh, my gosh.

827
00:55:05.644 --> 00:55:06.644
Jung Hee.

828
00:55:07.074 --> 00:55:09.644
We're friends now, right?

829
00:55:13.514 --> 00:55:16.054
Auntie. I need to step out.

830
00:55:16.623 --> 00:55:19.423
Where are you going like that? Jung Hee.

831
00:55:31.903 --> 00:55:37.574
(Pharmacy)

832
00:55:38.373 --> 00:55:40.344
I should've stayed with her.

833
00:58:20.273 --> 00:58:21.304
Don't cry.

834
00:58:55.244 --> 00:58:57.844
(Girls' Generation 1979)

835
00:59:00.813 --> 00:59:02.144
Stop following me.

836
00:59:02.614 --> 00:59:04.014
You're annoying me.

837
00:59:04.983 --> 00:59:06.713
I warned you...

838
00:59:06.853 --> 00:59:09.123
to stay away from Young Choon.

839
00:59:09.753 --> 00:59:11.324
A date? With Jin?

840
00:59:11.324 --> 00:59:13.023
They took the bus and went far, far away.

841
00:59:13.023 --> 00:59:14.923
They're very meticulous.

842
00:59:15.023 --> 00:59:16.224
Dong Moon?

843
00:59:17.333 --> 00:59:19.333
Jin is transferring to a school in Seoul.

844
00:59:21.333 --> 00:59:22.333
Then, was that...

845
00:59:22.804 --> 00:59:24.403
the last time?
