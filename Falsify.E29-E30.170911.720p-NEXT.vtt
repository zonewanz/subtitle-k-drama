00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:20.688
Hello?

2
00:00:21.138 --> 00:00:23.907
Is this Aeguk Newspaper?

3
00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:27.344
And you're Han Mu Young?

4
00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:29.279
(Episode 29)

5
00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:31.214
Yes, that's me.

6
00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:35.218
Your voice is very lively. You must be very confident about your life.

7
00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:38.789
Well, your voice is very resonant. I guess you must have been alive.

8
00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.794
Chief Director, look at the camera number three.

9
00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:45.429
Nam Kang Myung just showed up at Dongdaemun Gang's private vault.

10
00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:46.430
What?

11
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.698
Hey, but this is Nam Kang Myung, right?

12
00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:50.967
Turn around and show your face. Come on, scumbag. Turn around!

13
00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.936
Hold on.

14
00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:55.439
Nam Kang Myung is spotted.

15
00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:59.109
Dongdaemun Gang's private vault, 120 Chungmuro 4-ga.

16

(Dongdaemun Gang's private vault, 120 Chungmuro 4-ga.)

17
00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:10.187
You all checked your messages, right? Let's move.

18
00:01:11.054 --> 00:01:12.889
You haven't located him yet?

19
00:01:13.256 --> 00:01:14.758
Did you talk to all of his people?

20
00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:18.728
If people find out that he's alive, it'll put a lot of people in a bind.

21
00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.398
Ask the elders for their opinions.

22
00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.634
Worst case scenario, we might have to make the ultimate decision.

23
00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:26.803
He left the hospital.

24
00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:29.339
The phone was delivered as you instructed.

25
00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:33.276
Delete my number.

26
00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:37.414
And make sure you clean up before the investigation squad comes.

27
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.188
(Nam Kang Myung is spotted at Dongdaemun Gang's private vault.)

28
00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:51.027
I got the message. Nam Kang Myung showed up.

29
00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:54.564
I'll join the chase soon, but Yoo Kyung, I want you to...

30
00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:55.599
Suk Min.

31
00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.834
We were right.

32
00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:01.538
I'm at the hospital that Director Gu's wife is hospitalized in.

33
00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:05.108
But the name on her medical chart is different.

34
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.944
How is this even possible?

35
00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:09.446
What?

36
00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:13.917
I see that you're not someone to mess around with.

37
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.188
But I'm not an easy man.

38
00:02:18.488 --> 00:02:20.457
You're not on my level.

39
00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:23.693
Look.

40
00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:27.297
We've never even met. You can't threaten me like this.

41
00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:29.699
Why don't we talk face-to-face?

42
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.568
Nam Kang Myung,

43
00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.305
I guess you're ready to come out of your casket.

(Chief Director Yang Dong Shik)

47
00:02:48.118 --> 00:02:50.320
Hey, the prosecution is on their way there.

48
00:02:50.554 --> 00:02:52.856
But we don't have Nam Kang Myung's face on camera yet.

49
00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:55.559
We need evidence to write an article.

50
00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:57.894
Try to buy us some time.

51
00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:00.397
Okay.

52
00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:03.967
I'm fine with meeting you. But let me ask you one thing.

53
00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:08.939
Why are you so obsessed with me? Ever since Port Gung Pyung.

54
00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.307
Don't provoke him.

55
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:13.510
Try your best to listen to what he has to say.

56
00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:17.514
Did anyone in your family invest their money in my company?

57
00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:20.617
Or are you doing this because you need money?

58
00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:22.619
Don't tell me...

59
00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.789
you're doing this because...

60
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.959
you want to get a scoop rather than get money.

61
00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:30.627
I don't know.

62
00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:34.264
It seems like you only accessed half of my private vaults.

63
00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:36.266
Fine.

64
00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.835
I'll give you a big lump of money.

65
00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:41.137
So give me my keys back.

66
00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:43.506
It's a pretty nice deal.

67
00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:46.910
No one will get harmed, and you'll be earning money.

68
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.246
Okay? So just give me back my keys.

69
00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.480
That's weird.

70
00:03:51.548 --> 00:03:53.550
You lost money, but you're looking for your keys first.

71
00:03:54.618 --> 00:03:56.119
Do you think I'm doing this because I want money?

72
00:03:56.753 --> 00:03:59.356
That guy who died instead of you at Port Gung Pyung...

73
00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.558
had a tattoo on his wrist.

74
00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:03.893
I want to know about that tattoo.

75
00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:05.228
What?

76
00:04:29.286 --> 00:04:30.520
"Tattoo"?

77
00:04:31.454 --> 00:04:32.689
Let's see.

78
00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:34.758
Mu Young, he must be getting agitated.

79
00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:36.359
He's moving.

80
00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:37.927
He moved.

81
00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:39.329
He's moving around.

82
00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:41.598
- Yes!
- Nice!

83
00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:43.066
My gosh.

84
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.569
I'm sorry,

85
00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:48.438
but I really don't...

86
00:04:48.438 --> 00:04:52.309
understand what you're talking about right now.

87
00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:53.643
Mu Young, don't fall for this.

88
00:04:54.144 --> 00:04:57.080
We have his face on camera, so just buy us some time.

89
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.048
No.

90
00:04:58.848 --> 00:05:01.117
Your rubbish isn't going to work on me,

91
00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:02.719
so answer me properly.

92
00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.254
Hey, I told you not to provoke him!

93
00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.358
The guy who saved you at Port Gung Pyung...

94
00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:11.027
also had that tattoo on his wrist.

95
00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:13.663
They both had the exact same tattoo on their wrists.

96
00:05:14.097 --> 00:05:15.598
How are you going to explain that?

97
00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:18.768
I told you already. I don't know.

98
00:05:18.768 --> 00:05:21.705
The same image was engraved in the front door of Faith Center.

99
00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.407
And you were smiling in front of that door.

100
00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:27.243
I even have a photo. Are you going to keep lying?

101
00:05:27.344 --> 00:05:31.548
My gosh, I'm impressed by this country's media jackals.

102
00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:35.485
But you need to know when to stop writing a novel.

103
00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:36.553
But what are you going to do?

104
00:05:36.953 --> 00:05:39.489
I'm not the only one who knows about that tattoo.

105
00:05:40.023 --> 00:05:41.324
Do you remember...

106
00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:43.360
Seo Hae Young?

107
00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:48.098
You seemed pretty friendly in the photo, so I'm sure you know her.

108
00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:50.867
You better not pretend like you don't know her again.

109
00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:52.969
Do you know...

110
00:05:54.704 --> 00:05:56.439
what happened to her?

111
00:05:58.308 --> 00:05:59.909
She was buried behind a wall.

112
00:06:01.177 --> 00:06:02.979
Without knowing why,

113
00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:05.949
she was buried behind that dark wall...

114
00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.318
for many years.

115
00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:10.754
So tell me.

116
00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:13.256
Tell me what happened there...

117
00:06:13.556 --> 00:06:15.258
and why she had to die.

118
00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:18.328
I can give you back your money and keys.

119
00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:21.197
So answer my question first.

120
00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.969
Did you say she got buried without knowing why?

121
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:27.804
Hey.

122
00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.539
Stop talking nonsense.

123
00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:32.609
She knew why.

124
00:06:33.777 --> 00:06:36.746
She already knew that she'd end up like that...

125
00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:37.747
if she...

126
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.717
talked about stuff she shouldn't have.

127
00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:42.986
What?

128
00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:49.926
My goodness. You should've seen her beg.

129
00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.229
"Please don't kill me."

130
00:06:54.597 --> 00:06:56.900
"I did it out of pity."

131
00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:00.336
"I felt sorry for the kids."

132
00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:04.073
What did you just say?

133
00:07:04.607 --> 00:07:06.276
No, no.

134
00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.446
That shouldn't be your question right now.

135
00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:13.950
"How can I prevent myself from ending up like Seo Hae Young?"

136
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.119
That should've been your question.

137
00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.087
You crazy jerk.

138
00:07:18.087 --> 00:07:19.155
But...

139
00:07:19.756 --> 00:07:22.959
you're asking a lot of questions. So I'm guessing...

140
00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:25.295
you're recording me right now.

141
00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:30.633
I'm sure you're quite experienced, so I'm not all that surprised.

142
00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:32.035
But the problem is,

143
00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:34.003
I don't think...

144
00:07:35.138 --> 00:07:40.210
you'll be satisfied with just recording my voice.

145
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.179
Of course not. We even have your face on tape, you punk.

146
00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:45.448
But why is he searching that area?

147
00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:47.584
Get lost. Get lost!

148
00:07:47.584 --> 00:07:49.185
What if he finds our camera?

149
00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:50.353
Don't jinx it.

150
00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:53.990
It's going to take the prosecution some time to get there.

151
00:07:54.524 --> 00:07:55.558
Let's see.

152
00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:17.180
My gosh.

153
00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.550
You must've been spying on me...

154
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.085
like a little rat.

155
00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:24.454
I can't just let go of this.

156
00:08:24.687 --> 00:08:25.755
Hey.

157
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.727
You better call your family, friends, and lover...

158
00:08:30.727 --> 00:08:32.595
and tell them that you'll meet them in your next life.

159
00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:33.696
Mr. Nam Kang Myung.

160
00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:35.198
Listen to me carefully.

161
00:08:35.465 --> 00:08:38.568
I'm the one who has all your money and the keys to your vaults.

162
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:42.205
If you do anything funny, you'll end up losing everything.

163
00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:44.407
Fine, go ahead.

164
00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:47.844
Let's see who'll end up regretting more.

165
00:08:49.045 --> 00:08:51.948
I think it's my turn...

166

The phone call lasted quite long.

310
00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:25.167
Should we wrap up what we were discussing before?

311
00:21:26.135 --> 00:21:27.403
Sure. We should.

312
00:21:38.847 --> 00:21:39.948
Yes, I heard.

313
00:21:40.282 --> 00:21:41.684
He died while fleeing.

314
00:21:41.884 --> 00:21:45.954
But we were supposed to catch him when he mentioned about Director Gu.

315

That's how we could've cut a deal.

With his death, there isn't a way to save our team.

But he apparently asked the same thing we did.

322
00:22:01.236 --> 00:22:02.538
He asked for Faith Center's contact number.

323
00:22:02.938 --> 00:22:05.307
But it was already long after it got damaged by the fire,

324
00:22:05.307 --> 00:22:07.443
so the center couldn't provide him with any information.

325
00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:10.479
Does that mean he left with nothing?

326
00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:13.549
No. He came back later on and took the contact number of...

327
00:22:14.316 --> 00:22:17.186
the photographer who took Nam Kang Myung and Seo Hae Young's photo.

328
00:22:17.186 --> 00:22:19.888

00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:27.296
(Boram Lunchbox's Yearly Ledger)

332
00:22:39.908 --> 00:22:41.610
- You heard the news, right?
- Yes.

333
00:22:42.077 --> 00:22:43.078
Wait.

334
00:22:43.746 --> 00:22:45.748
Director Gu's wife also has a heart disease.

335
00:22:47.015 --> 00:22:49.017
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to barge in like this.

336
00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:50.185
She's not a kid.

337
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.255
If she got treated by abusing her husband's power,

338
00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:54.456
she should get criticized.

339
00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:57.192
But she seemed like she didn't know anything about her husband.

340
00:22:58.394 --> 00:23:00.028
She's sick.

341
00:23:00.028 --> 00:23:02.097
Plus, we know her.

342
00:23:02.598 --> 00:23:04.433
I saw Noah's Cho Young Ki...

343
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:07.636
going into Director Gu's office earlier.

344
00:23:08.337 --> 00:23:11.306
I'm sure Cho Young Ki's the culprit behind this incident.

345
00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:14.376
He was the first one to hear that Nam Kang Myung had disappeared.

346
00:23:14.877 --> 00:23:18.347
Then did you hear what they talked about?

347
00:23:18.914 --> 00:23:22.217
"Bring him to me before the elders find out."

348
00:23:23.452 --> 00:23:25.954
"The elders"? Who are they?

349
00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:27.156
I don't know.

350
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.057
I should start looking into it.

351
00:23:30.726 --> 00:23:32.928
If we give up right now,

352
00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:36.899
we never know when these clues might disappear.

353
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.903
These people are experts in making the real evidence...

354
00:23:41.703 --> 00:23:43.238
lose their power and become useless.

355
00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:45.274
Director Gu...

356
00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:47.843
might find out that we're after him.

357
00:23:48.577 --> 00:23:49.578
Even so...

358
00:23:50.379 --> 00:23:51.380
Even if he finds out...

359
00:23:54.716 --> 00:23:55.717
Let's go.

360
00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:14.236
It's been a while.

361
00:24:15.637 --> 00:24:18.240
Do you remember me?

("Bruised-up Boy's Cause of Death is in Question")

363

(Journalist Gu Tae Won)

364
00:24:25.948 --> 00:24:28.917
My gosh, I don't understand what this is about.

365
00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:31.053
"Faith Center"?

366
00:24:32.287 --> 00:24:34.857
"Sahae Foundation"? I don't know anything about this.

367
00:24:35.457 --> 00:24:37.092
I've never heard of this.

368
00:24:38.193 --> 00:24:40.262
What a load of nonsense.

369
00:24:40.496 --> 00:24:42.197
I'm staying in this hospital right now.

370
00:24:42.698 --> 00:24:44.500
What do you mean it's not under my name?

371
00:24:44.933 --> 00:24:48.303
People who wish to hide the fact that they got surgery...

372
00:24:48.437 --> 00:24:50.439
normally use someone else's name.

373
00:24:51.173 --> 00:24:52.174
Or...

374
00:24:52.674 --> 00:24:55.577
you could've received surgery by using power.

375
00:24:56.044 --> 00:24:58.747
But I have absolutely nothing to hide.

376
00:25:03.819 --> 00:25:05.254
But how is it possible for me...

377
00:25:05.854 --> 00:25:07.789
to receive a heart transplant again...

378
00:25:08.223 --> 00:25:09.258
when some people...

379
00:25:10.192 --> 00:25:11.260
never even get to receive it once?

380
00:25:12.494 --> 00:25:13.495
This...

381
00:25:14.496 --> 00:25:16.064
doesn't make sense.

382
00:25:16.832 --> 00:25:17.966
Don't you agree?

383
00:25:21.003 --> 00:25:24.673
Six years ago, when you received your first heart transplant,

384
00:25:24.673 --> 00:25:27.075
were you on top of the waiting list?

385
00:25:28.844 --> 00:25:31.179
Then have you never wondered...

386
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.149
how your turn could've come back so quickly?

387
00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:37.686
I know you didn't know anything.

388
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:40.689
I also know that Director Gu didn't tell you anything either.

389
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:42.958
But the reason we're telling you this right now...

390
00:25:43.825 --> 00:25:44.860
is because...

391
00:25:46.028 --> 00:25:49.698
an article about Director Gu's misdeeds will be published soon.

392
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:54.536
- What?
- And if no evidence gets found,

393
00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:58.073
we're going to talk about your medical treatment.

394
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:03.545
It will be a long, nasty fight.

395
00:26:03.845 --> 00:26:05.914
But I'm sure you don't want things to turn out that way.

396
00:26:07.182 --> 00:26:09.785
You should leave. I have nothing to say to you.

397
00:26:09.918 --> 00:26:11.353
I know it'll be hard, but...

398
00:26:11.353 --> 00:26:13.822
I said, you should leave. I don't have anything to say to you.

399
00:26:14.957 --> 00:26:16.124
Do you remember...

400
00:26:17.292 --> 00:26:19.094
Han Chul Ho, who died five years ago?

401
00:26:20.228 --> 00:26:22.197
He got killed while trying to reveal something.

402
00:26:22.464 --> 00:26:25.267
And your husband is the one who covered up his death...

403
00:26:26.602 --> 00:26:28.337
as an accidental happening.

404
00:26:29.738 --> 00:26:30.806
Chul Ho's younger brother...

405
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.743
spent the last five years trying to find his brother's murderer.

406
00:26:36.278 --> 00:26:37.813
Shouldn't we tell him...

407
00:26:39.748 --> 00:26:41.383
the truth?

408
00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:44.119
Please give us the facts.

409
00:26:45.754 --> 00:26:47.556
Tell us what happened.

410
00:26:49.057 --> 00:26:50.425
Director Gu...

411
00:26:51.493 --> 00:26:53.962
won't ever be able to escape from this by himself.

412
00:27:17.686 --> 00:27:21.189
(Husband)

413
00:27:34.002 --> 00:27:35.070
All right.

414
00:27:35.337 --> 00:27:37.773
We're going to discuss with the prosecution on when...

415
00:27:37.773 --> 00:27:40.442
we should release the article about Nam Kang Myung.

416
00:27:42.678 --> 00:27:44.479
But the Splash Team...

417
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.882
and Prosecutor Kwon are still in trouble.

418
00:27:47.616 --> 00:27:49.951
We should've gotten some information from Nam Kang Myung...

419
00:27:50.686 --> 00:27:52.587
in order to save them from losing their jobs.

420
00:27:52.988 --> 00:27:54.823
Who knew that he'd die like that?

421
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.026
Mu Young, is there really no other way?

422
00:27:58.527 --> 00:27:59.528
I don't know.

423
00:27:59.728 --> 00:28:01.897
They said they're going to do their best.

424
00:28:02.397 --> 00:28:04.132
I'm sure things won't end so easily.

425
00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:06.068
Let's trust that things will go well.

426
00:28:06.868 --> 00:28:10.038
- Please tell us again.
- We heard that...

427
00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:18.113
What's this?

428
00:28:18.914 --> 00:28:20.215
Take a photo of this.

429
00:28:27.889 --> 00:28:30.192
Did this man ever visit the hospital?

430
00:28:30.859 --> 00:28:31.893
I don't know.

431
00:28:36.398 --> 00:28:38.133
This is Director Gu of Daehan Newspaper.

432
00:28:38.867 --> 00:28:39.901
Did he ever come here?

433
00:28:41.236 --> 00:28:42.404
I don't know.

434
00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:45.207
Was it Director Gu?

435
00:28:48.877 --> 00:28:51.780
He was the one who helped Nam Kang Myung?

436
00:28:56.184 --> 00:28:57.285
How interesting.

437
00:28:58.787 --> 00:29:00.422
This is so ridiculous.

438
00:29:00.922 --> 00:29:02.057
Let's go.

439
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.597
So how much do you know about Gu Tae Won?

440
00:29:08.697 --> 00:29:09.798
Do you have any evidence?

441
00:29:10.031 --> 00:29:11.166
No.

442
00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:14.002
I just know that he gave orders to fabricate articles.

443
00:29:15.237 --> 00:29:17.472
But Splash Team is looking for evidence right now.

444
00:29:18.206 --> 00:29:20.842
They're going to write an article about him as soon as they find one.

445
00:29:21.309 --> 00:29:22.344
It makes sense.

446
00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:26.148
If we act too hastily, we will end up the ones in trouble.

447
00:29:26.548 --> 00:29:28.884
My gosh. But who will be able to attack...

448
00:29:29.284 --> 00:29:30.685
the head of Daehan Newspaper?

449
00:29:31.386 --> 00:29:32.454
That's why...

450
00:29:33.655 --> 00:29:35.357
I'd like to ask you for a favor,

451
00:29:37.058 --> 00:29:39.828
since I'm restricted from doing what I want right now.

452
00:29:42.097 --> 00:29:44.166
- Let's take a coffee break.
- Okay.

"Hacking".

What's he trying to hack?

(Chief Prosecutor Cha)

458
00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:39.087
Chief Prosecutor Cha.

459
00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:43.458
Is this really all you found in Nam Kang Myung's hospital room?

460
00:30:43.458 --> 00:30:45.393
Someone had already cleaned up.

461
00:30:46.094 --> 00:30:48.296
The CCTV footages were all gone,

462
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.498
and no one would testify anything clearly.

463
00:30:51.299 --> 00:30:53.034
By the way,

464
00:30:53.301 --> 00:30:54.903
I have a question for you.

465
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:56.504
Yes?

466
00:30:56.504 --> 00:30:58.206
Do you know what...

467
00:30:59.207 --> 00:31:01.276
Cho Young Ki's father used to do?

468
00:31:01.543 --> 00:31:02.677
His father?

469
00:31:04.579 --> 00:31:07.582
Did you say she got buried without knowing why?

470
00:31:08.316 --> 00:31:09.384
Hey.

471
00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:11.086
Stop talking nonsense.

472
00:31:11.586 --> 00:31:14.189
She knew why.

473
00:31:15.257 --> 00:31:18.360
She already knew that she'd end up like that...

474
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.394
if she...

475
00:31:20.562 --> 00:31:22.097
talked about stuff she shouldn't have.

476
00:31:24.266 --> 00:31:26.835
Seo Hae Young was Faith Center's whistle blower.

477
00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:29.704
She got murdered because someone found out about that.

478
00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:32.007
And the guy who accidentally picked up the knife...

479
00:31:32.407 --> 00:31:33.508
I know everything.

480
00:31:34.709 --> 00:31:35.677
They are...

481
00:31:36.912 --> 00:31:37.979
It was Park Eung Mo.

482
00:31:40.081 --> 00:31:42.884
What in the world happened at Faith Center?

483
00:31:44.185 --> 00:31:45.987
What did they have to hide...

484
00:31:46.454 --> 00:31:48.924
that made them kill so many people?

485
00:31:49.758 --> 00:31:51.259
The men with the tattoos...

486
00:31:52.394 --> 00:31:53.561
are a part of the project.

487
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.065
So you're a part of the project?

488
00:31:58.133 --> 00:31:59.634
But who planned this project?

489
00:32:00.936 --> 00:32:02.337

We'll begin the disciplinary hearing for Prosecutor Kwon So Ra...

of Violent Crimes Unit One, Incheon Prosecutors' Office.

493
00:32:12.217 --> 00:32:14.117
Prosecutor Kwon So Ra,

494
00:32:14.117 --> 00:32:17.197
we'll give you a chance to vindicate your actions. You may begin.

495
00:32:17.647 --> 00:32:19.107
I...

496
00:32:20.387 --> 00:32:21.607
admit my wrongdoings.

497
00:32:22.957 --> 00:32:25.147
However, I'd make the same decision...

498
00:32:25.697 --> 00:32:27.907
if I find myself in the same situation once again.

499
00:32:29.497 --> 00:32:30.717
I don't know...

500
00:32:31.637 --> 00:32:33.117
since when...

501
00:32:34.467 --> 00:32:37.187
did the prosecutorial right became a weapon that hurts its citizens...

502
00:32:38.107 --> 00:32:40.327
and why betraying the weak...

503
00:32:41.747 --> 00:32:43.557
has become the norm.

504
00:32:47.047 --> 00:32:48.737
Don't you agree,

505
00:32:50.117 --> 00:32:52.507
Prosecutor Im Ji Tae?

506
00:32:55.527 --> 00:32:57.837
Prosecutor Im, make your statement.

507
00:32:57.927 --> 00:33:00.847
You're involved in this incident just as much.

508
00:33:02.167 --> 00:33:03.347
All right.

509
00:33:03.567 --> 00:33:05.687
This happened under my watch.

510
00:33:05.937 --> 00:33:07.817
I have no excuses.

511
00:33:08.407 --> 00:33:12.657
However, the prosecution lost all its trust from the public.

512
00:33:13.107 --> 00:33:16.497
Not aiding a suspect because of a personal grudge against him.

513
00:33:16.747 --> 00:33:19.267
She may be innocent in the eyes of the law,

514
00:33:19.547 --> 00:33:21.167
but I believe she must be guilty...

515
00:33:22.617 --> 00:33:24.287
in the eyes of our citizens.

516
00:33:24.287 --> 00:33:25.337
Sir.

517
00:33:25.337 --> 00:33:27.767
Don't you think we should never make a mistake of hiring...

518
00:33:27.767 --> 00:33:30.207
someone as unethical as she is, ever again?

519
00:33:30.427 --> 00:33:31.807
Do you have evidence?

520
00:33:32.897 --> 00:33:35.647
- What are you talking about?
- The evidence that...

521
00:33:36.267 --> 00:33:37.647
I'm unethical.

522
00:33:39.237 --> 00:33:42.987
You're saying you haven't heard the recording the whole country heard?

523
00:33:43.507 --> 00:33:46.557
The recording file Splash Team and you buried together.

524
00:33:48.147 --> 00:33:50.997
Sir, I think the subject of this disciplinary hearing...

525
00:33:51.107 --> 00:33:52.967
seems to have forgotten her wrongdoings.

526
00:33:52.967 --> 00:33:55.667
May I play the recording?

527
00:33:55.747 --> 00:33:56.837
Yes, you may.

528
00:33:56.837 --> 00:33:58.137
Please.

529
00:33:58.957 --> 00:34:01.537
Let's wait 10 minutes before we go.

530
00:34:02.057 --> 00:34:06.477
That man is still smiling after committing that many crimes.

531
00:34:07.057 --> 00:34:09.817
What can we do to ease their pain?

532
00:34:10.867 --> 00:34:12.017
10 minutes.

533
00:34:12.537 --> 00:34:14.447
I don't think that's such a long time.

534
00:34:15.007 --> 00:34:17.287
You heard it, right? Did everyone hear the recording?

535
00:34:18.007 --> 00:34:20.427
You. Answer me.

536
00:34:21.477 --> 00:34:24.597
What is this if not the evidence of your lack of morality?

537
00:34:24.877 --> 00:34:28.167
Lieutenant Jeon, how does it feel to kill a person?

538
00:34:28.287 --> 00:34:30.837
I bet you feel the world is ending and you don't want to live anymore.

539
00:34:30.837 --> 00:34:33.007
Hold on. What is this?

540
00:34:33.007 --> 00:34:34.107
This isn't the file.

541
00:34:34.107 --> 00:34:36.177
Let's hear what this is. Keep playing.

542
00:34:37.487 --> 00:34:40.277
Well, should I make it disappear? What do you think?

543
00:34:41.467 --> 00:34:43.177
But why don't we do this?

544
00:34:43.797 --> 00:34:47.287
I'll be the alligator, and you'll be the plover bird.

545
00:34:47.537 --> 00:34:50.587
I can't bring back a dead person. Whoever is left ought to live...

546
00:34:51.167 --> 00:34:54.057
Wait. This is all a lie.

547
00:34:54.057 --> 00:34:55.697
This recording is fabricated.

548
00:35:06.487 --> 00:35:07.907
I'd like to ask for your cooperation.

549
00:35:08.587 --> 00:35:13.597
I'll carry out the arrest warrant for Chief Prosecutor Im Ji Tae.

550
00:35:13.597 --> 00:35:14.807
Chief Prosecutor Cha.

551
00:35:15.767 --> 00:35:17.147
What are you doing?

552
00:35:19.937 --> 00:35:21.387
On what grounds?

553
00:35:21.437 --> 00:35:25.257
This is the memory card I found from late Lieutenant Jeon's desk.

554
00:35:27.107 --> 00:35:28.457
In addition to this recording,

555
00:35:28.947 --> 00:35:32.467
there are 3 videos and the call history for the past 2 years...

556
00:35:34.617 --> 00:35:36.237
are saved on this card.

557
00:35:37.787 --> 00:35:38.907
Mr. Im Ji Tae,

558
00:35:39.587 --> 00:35:42.477
you're under arrest for dereliction of duty and abuse of your authority.

559
00:35:42.657 --> 00:35:43.777
What did you just say?

560
00:35:43.777 --> 00:35:46.947
You have the right to an attorney. Anything you say can and will be...

561
00:35:46.947 --> 00:35:48.077
Inspector Park!

562
00:35:48.527 --> 00:35:50.017
Why did you do it,

563
00:35:50.797 --> 00:35:51.987
sir?

564
00:35:52.237 --> 00:35:53.387
Let's go.

565
00:35:54.167 --> 00:35:55.457
Don't touch me.

566
00:36:02.547 --> 00:36:04.827
The detective who reported regarding Lieutenant Jeon's murder.

567
00:36:06.747 --> 00:36:07.897
Is this the detective?

568
00:36:08.887 --> 00:36:10.037
In the recording file,

569
00:36:10.787 --> 00:36:12.907
his name came up quite frequently.

570
00:36:14.557 --> 00:36:16.577
You're making a mistake.

571
00:36:17.987 --> 00:36:19.147
Let's go.

572
00:36:27.137 --> 00:36:28.757
Why are you doing this to me?

573
00:36:35.177 --> 00:36:37.627
I need to brief you about something.

574
00:36:38.007 --> 00:36:40.967
Nam Kang Myung, who was believed to be dead six years ago,

575
00:36:41.017 --> 00:36:42.337
had been alive.

576
00:36:42.587 --> 00:36:44.397
He was alive up until last night.

577
00:36:44.917 --> 00:36:48.637
This is the article that will printed in Aeguk Newspaper tomorrow.

578
00:36:52.697 --> 00:36:54.607
("Exclusive, Nam Kang Myung Was Certainly Alive")

579
00:36:54.607 --> 00:36:56.317
What nonsense...

580
00:36:56.967 --> 00:36:58.617
Since it was such an important matter,

581
00:36:58.837 --> 00:37:00.917
I came to a decision of forming a joint investigation team...

582
00:37:00.917 --> 00:37:03.517
to go against the factions who protected Nam Kang Myung.

583
00:37:04.307 --> 00:37:08.497
And it is our opinion that we need Prosecutor Kwon So Ra...

584
00:37:08.977 --> 00:37:12.067
who played a major role in catching Nam Kang Myung.

585
00:37:24.487 --> 00:37:29.917
(Director Gu Tae Won)

586
00:37:33.037 --> 00:37:34.887
- Yes.
- Let's talk.

587
00:37:34.887 --> 00:37:37.257
Is there anything left for us to discuss?

588
00:37:37.437 --> 00:37:39.527
Check the surveillance camera in front of your office.

589
00:37:40.937 --> 00:37:42.197
That will answer your question.

590
00:38:06.167 --> 00:38:08.857
I asked to meet with you to ask a few questions.

591
00:38:08.937 --> 00:38:13.087
You dragged me here for negotiations with your illegally taped recording.

592
00:38:14.107 --> 00:38:16.257
But you only have a few questions to ask me?

593
00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:18.157
I have a scoop.

594
00:38:19.477 --> 00:38:21.267
Nam Kang Myung had been alive all along.

595
00:38:22.117 --> 00:38:25.637
Right before he died around 10:40pm last night.

596
00:38:26.617 --> 00:38:27.907
I must ask,

597
00:38:28.557 --> 00:38:30.937
were you really unaware of this?

598
00:38:32.127 --> 00:38:33.177
I didn't know.

599
00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:35.317
Attorney Cho Young Ki with whom you had a private conversation...

600
00:38:35.997 --> 00:38:37.367
said something else.

601
00:38:37.367 --> 00:38:39.017
I didn't know.

602
00:38:39.497 --> 00:38:42.957
Your story isn't consistent with the recording of a stowaway you gave us.

603
00:38:43.307 --> 00:38:45.587
Every tip can't be true.

604
00:38:45.807 --> 00:38:47.587
Did you not trust the informant?

605
00:38:49.347 --> 00:38:52.167
Then did you trust Han Chul Ho?

606
00:38:53.747 --> 00:38:54.997
Six years ago,

607
00:38:55.587 --> 00:38:58.737
it was Chul Ho who made everyone believe Nam Kang Myung was dead.

608
00:38:58.987 --> 00:39:01.437
The article persuaded the public.

609
00:39:01.857 --> 00:39:05.137
Since you didn't trust the informant, but you trusted Chul Ho,

610
00:39:06.627 --> 00:39:09.517
I bet you thought Nam Kang Myung was dead, am I right?

611
00:39:10.867 --> 00:39:14.147
The team leader ought to trust the team's members.

612
00:39:14.167 --> 00:39:15.387
You're incompetent.

613
00:39:16.707 --> 00:39:18.727
I can't believe you trusted a journalist like Chul Ho.

614
00:39:19.977 --> 00:39:21.827
- What?
- We've confirmed that...

615
00:39:23.107 --> 00:39:26.127
Chul Ho wrote at least two fabricated articles.

616
00:39:28.317 --> 00:39:30.567
The article that framed Yoon Seon Woo as the murderer.

617
00:39:31.917 --> 00:39:34.437
The article that made Nam Kang Myung a dead man.

618
00:39:35.627 --> 00:39:36.877
Did you already know...

619
00:39:37.687 --> 00:39:39.647
that Chul Ho wrote fabricated articles?

620
00:39:40.627 --> 00:39:41.807
No.

621
00:39:42.997 --> 00:39:45.387
Had I known, I would have taken care of it then.

622
00:39:45.387 --> 00:39:47.887
If you didn't know, that makes you an even more incompetent leader.

623
00:39:49.007 --> 00:39:50.587
Are you going to choose that road?

624
00:39:53.807 --> 00:39:55.297
There's nothing I can do about it.

625
00:39:55.877 --> 00:39:58.797
I didn't know before the scandal regarding Yoon Seon Woo.

626
00:39:59.477 --> 00:40:01.867
Admitting it was fabricated wouldn't have done any good.

627
00:40:02.587 --> 00:40:05.407
I kept my silence for the sake of the company.

628
00:40:05.787 --> 00:40:06.937
That's odd.

629
00:40:07.957 --> 00:40:09.437
I had to pay...

630
00:40:09.857 --> 00:40:13.647
for a false report for five years because it happened under my watch.

631
00:40:14.927 --> 00:40:16.577
But you, sir,

632
00:40:17.497 --> 00:40:19.747
are not taking responsibility for this.

633
00:40:20.167 --> 00:40:23.157
It was a mistake only one journalist made.

634
00:40:24.537 --> 00:40:27.027
It was impossible for me to find out...

635
00:40:27.027 --> 00:40:29.627
what Chul Ho was plotting under my watch.

636
00:40:30.047 --> 00:40:32.067
"I trust Chul Ho."

637
00:40:32.417 --> 00:40:35.267
"The team leader ought to trust the team's members."

638
00:40:37.087 --> 00:40:38.907
This is what you told me just now.

639
00:40:39.987 --> 00:40:41.307
It hasn't even been a minute...

640
00:40:42.227 --> 00:40:44.837
since you said this, but you're already criticizing him.

641
00:40:45.997 --> 00:40:49.017
Did you always believe in others without any basis,

642
00:40:49.397 --> 00:40:52.417
and abandon them once things don't work out?

643
00:40:53.137 --> 00:40:54.287
Or...

644
00:40:55.037 --> 00:40:58.987
is there a reason you have to say that all you did was trust Chul Ho?

645
00:41:03.977 --> 00:41:05.867
What do you want?

646
00:41:06.817 --> 00:41:09.037
The Splash Team will not disappear.

647
00:41:09.747 --> 00:41:11.637
I will also keep my place.

648
00:41:12.617 --> 00:41:16.677
Jang Hak Su, who published a false article on me and Kwon So Ra,

649
00:41:17.427 --> 00:41:20.047
will have to print a correction on the Seoul Post.

650
00:41:21.867 --> 00:41:23.017
Then...

651
00:41:24.597 --> 00:41:26.187
this audio file...

652
00:41:27.237 --> 00:41:29.757
won't be revealed to the world.

653
00:41:30.737 --> 00:41:34.027
Why do you think I'll agree to that deal?

654
00:41:35.247 --> 00:41:36.857
Because you came here.

655
00:41:38.647 --> 00:41:41.827
You supposedly didn't know that Nam Kang Myung was alive.

656
00:41:43.487 --> 00:41:47.407
There's no way you could know what Cho Young Ki said.

657
00:41:47.757 --> 00:41:49.277
There's no way...

658
00:41:49.827 --> 00:41:53.347
you could know the contents of this audio file.

659
00:41:55.397 --> 00:41:56.917
But with just one call,

660
00:41:57.667 --> 00:41:59.517
you came all the way here.

661
00:42:00.967 --> 00:42:02.517
And you're calling this table...

662
00:42:03.737 --> 00:42:06.427
the negotiation table.

663
00:42:08.677 --> 00:42:10.097
If you want it that bad,

664
00:42:11.047 --> 00:42:12.667
I can negotiate with you.

665
00:42:13.517 --> 00:42:15.167
That's the duty of a junior employee.

666
00:42:20.557 --> 00:42:21.707
Goodness.

667
00:42:22.527 --> 00:42:25.607
Sorry to interrupt you. We didn't know you were here.

668
00:42:26.127 --> 00:42:28.727
They heard about the scoop on Nam Kang Myung.

669
00:42:28.727 --> 00:42:30.347
They wanted a look around. I'm sorry.

670
00:42:30.497 --> 00:42:33.887
But what were you two talking about?

671
00:42:37.107 --> 00:42:38.857
I'm the same.

672
00:42:39.837 --> 00:42:44.127
I came here to congratulate him on the scoop.

673
00:42:44.907 --> 00:42:47.967
Do we have to break up the team?

674
00:42:47.977 --> 00:42:49.137
Well,

675
00:42:51.287 --> 00:42:53.637
the company will have to protect it.

676
00:42:53.757 --> 00:42:57.607
You're a part of this family that produces such great results.

677
00:43:01.257 --> 00:43:04.517
You'll soon pay for stabbing me in the back.

678
00:43:04.597 --> 00:43:06.847
You'll get hurt before then.

679
00:43:07.337 --> 00:43:09.117
You'll be stabbed...

680
00:43:09.807 --> 00:43:11.887
by the blade you created.

681
00:43:12.877 --> 00:43:15.697
I'll only take half the advice.

682
00:43:19.017 --> 00:43:22.067
Thank you, Director. We'll repay this honor with a bigger scoop.

683
00:43:23.587 --> 00:43:25.137
Okay, I'll look forward to it.

684
00:43:25.137 --> 00:43:27.037
And to tell you a bit about our next story,

685
00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:29.407
we plan to investigate a place called the Faith Center.

686
00:43:30.427 --> 00:43:31.487
Faith Center?

687
00:43:31.487 --> 00:43:35.377
Yes, it was the last place Chul Ho was investigating before he died.

688
00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:37.717
We're going to continue his work.

689
00:43:37.867 --> 00:43:40.017
And the story Chul Ho couldn't tell,

690
00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:41.617
we're going to reveal it to the world...

691
00:43:42.407 --> 00:43:44.057
in Splash Team's name.

692
00:43:54.247 --> 00:43:57.437
Lee Suk Min got a scoop on Nam Kang Myung being alive.

693
00:43:57.587 --> 00:44:00.707
So when you get the article, print it first page in Social Team's name.

694
00:44:00.707 --> 00:44:02.307
Take out the Splash Team's name.

695
00:44:02.357 --> 00:44:04.777
Make them mute for the rest of their lives.

696
00:44:05.357 --> 00:44:08.947
I'm going to show them how hard it'll be to endure this.

697
00:44:10.567 --> 00:44:12.017
What do you guys think?

698
00:44:12.267 --> 00:44:15.087
I doubt he'll just let us publish the scoop...

699
00:44:15.197 --> 00:44:17.157
without doing anything.

700
00:44:17.307 --> 00:44:18.817
What can he do?

701
00:44:19.337 --> 00:44:20.527
You don't think...

702
00:44:20.737 --> 00:44:23.297
He can stop the Splash Team's article from getting published.

703
00:44:28.347 --> 00:44:30.467
He can't risk his fate like that.

704
00:44:30.817 --> 00:44:33.737
Start hacking the system, and don't leave a trace.

705
00:44:33.757 --> 00:44:35.007
The serial code...

706
00:44:35.087 --> 00:44:40.947
is 4, 19, 6, E, 9, A.

707
00:44:40.947 --> 00:44:42.247
Hacking?

708
00:44:44.527 --> 00:44:47.087
What's he scheming now?

709
00:44:51.867 --> 00:44:54.587
(Chief Prosecutor Im Ji Tae)

710
00:44:59.317 --> 00:45:02.837
It's been too long since he talked about searching Nam Kang Myung.

711
00:45:08.087 --> 00:45:09.237
(Collection)

712
00:45:09.727 --> 00:45:12.447
She's Seo Hae Young, the victim of Park Eung Mo's case.

713
00:45:13.857 --> 00:45:15.127
She didn't die...

714
00:45:15.127 --> 00:45:18.647
in August 2000 when the statute of limitations had expired.

715
00:45:18.837 --> 00:45:21.847
She was still alive in 2001.

716
00:45:23.337 --> 00:45:26.027
So who are you trying to attack with this?

717
00:45:26.027 --> 00:45:28.627
The NISI employee who fabricated her time of death,

718
00:45:28.737 --> 00:45:30.627
and the person who pulled the strings from behind.

719
00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:32.367
(Statement)

720
00:45:32.367 --> 00:45:34.967
I'd like the ultimate target of this investigation...

721
00:45:35.487 --> 00:45:38.797
to be Lawyer Cho Young Ki of Noah.

722
00:45:46.957 --> 00:45:48.277
Mr. Cho.

723
00:45:53.467 --> 00:45:54.747
What's this?

724
00:45:55.097 --> 00:45:57.517
Our Chief would like to see you.

725
00:45:58.067 --> 00:46:00.627
(Arrest Warrant)

726
00:46:02.847 --> 00:46:05.397
My gosh, you're handsome.

727
00:46:06.477 --> 00:46:07.627
Let's go.

728
00:46:14.757 --> 00:46:18.007
Nam Kang Myung's story is on the front-page headlines.

729
00:46:18.027 --> 00:46:19.277
But it's not our article.

730
00:46:19.457 --> 00:46:21.307
It was published in Sang Hoon's name.

731
00:46:21.307 --> 00:46:24.867
There's no mention of the Splash Team in the whole newspaper.

732
00:46:24.867 --> 00:46:27.517
They want to make us mute while we're alive.

733
00:46:28.367 --> 00:46:29.557
Do you guys...

734
00:46:31.107 --> 00:46:33.427
know which page Hae Dong never sees...

735
00:46:34.107 --> 00:46:36.297
when reviewing the final draft?

736
00:46:36.297 --> 00:46:37.897
There's no such page...

737
00:46:41.017 --> 00:46:43.267
- No way.
- That's what I thought too.

738
00:46:43.847 --> 00:46:45.707
I didn't think it'd end like this.

739
00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:49.207
Regardless, we have to publish the article.

740
00:46:50.027 --> 00:46:51.977
But if this is how far he'll go,

741
00:46:52.697 --> 00:46:55.047
it means the person who tried to stop the Faith Center article...

742
00:46:55.497 --> 00:46:57.217
was Director Gu Tae Won.

743
00:46:58.097 --> 00:46:59.247
Then...

744
00:46:59.337 --> 00:47:00.847
It's what we know.

745
00:47:02.237 --> 00:47:04.757
It's time to call Mu Young.

746
00:47:12.647 --> 00:47:14.267
So Seo Hae Young...

747
00:47:14.817 --> 00:47:16.987
was the whistleblower in the Faith Center?

748
00:47:16.987 --> 00:47:18.197
Yes.

749
00:47:18.487 --> 00:47:21.967
But I can't figure out what happened in that center.

750
00:47:22.727 --> 00:47:25.437
Ultimately, this all began at the Faith Center.

751
00:47:26.097 --> 00:47:27.447
Chul Ho, you,

752
00:47:28.257 --> 00:47:30.147
and all of this.

753
00:47:30.267 --> 00:47:31.647
What are you talking about?

754
00:47:31.767 --> 00:47:34.487
Why do you think you and Park Eung Mo were tied together?

755
00:47:35.237 --> 00:47:36.757
There is no why.

756
00:47:37.737 --> 00:47:39.857
I just followed Chul Ho's articles.

757
00:47:39.877 --> 00:47:41.757
Then why did you meet Yoon Seon Woo?

758
00:47:43.377 --> 00:47:46.067
I just followed Chul Ho's articles for that too.

759
00:47:46.067 --> 00:47:48.167
Why did you meet Nam Kang Myung?

760
00:47:50.987 --> 00:47:52.267
That was also...

761
00:47:53.657 --> 00:47:55.737
because I was following Chul Ho's articles.

762
00:47:56.627 --> 00:47:58.607
It's not a coincidence that we're here.

763
00:47:59.227 --> 00:48:01.247
Chul Ho led you here.

764
00:48:01.797 --> 00:48:03.517
You followed the exact...

765
00:48:04.127 --> 00:48:06.117
footsteps he left behind.

766
00:48:07.737 --> 00:48:12.427
And if there's one more article that you haven't seen...

767
00:48:31.457 --> 00:48:33.647
When he started investigating the Faith Center,

768
00:48:35.967 --> 00:48:37.747
the first thing he looked into...

769
00:48:39.367 --> 00:48:40.787
was Daehan Newspaper.

770
00:48:42.037 --> 00:48:43.257
Chul Ho,

771
00:48:44.107 --> 00:48:46.527
or someone who ordered Chul Ho to write false articles...

772
00:48:47.677 --> 00:48:50.897
wrote something on the Faith Center, then that in itself...

773
00:48:51.107 --> 00:48:52.667
would become a clue.

774
00:48:54.777 --> 00:48:56.537
But he couldn't find anything.

775
00:48:57.647 --> 00:48:58.797
Instead,

776
00:48:59.857 --> 00:49:01.507
he found this article...

777
00:49:02.557 --> 00:49:04.277
in the Seoul Post.

778
00:49:06.697 --> 00:49:07.747
("7-year-old Boy from Faith Center Dies in Car Accident")

779
00:49:07.747 --> 00:49:08.847
Faith Center?

780
00:49:10.827 --> 00:49:12.217
But this...

781
00:49:12.837 --> 00:49:15.147
is just an article about a car accident.

782
00:49:15.147 --> 00:49:16.357
What if...

783
00:49:17.007 --> 00:49:19.227
he didn't die from a car accident?

784
00:49:19.977 --> 00:49:22.827
And what if there was a Daehan Newspaper reporter...

785
00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:25.457
who covered that up?

786
00:49:26.917 --> 00:49:28.427
In 2001,

787
00:49:28.717 --> 00:49:31.667
reporters in both Daehan Newspaper and the Seoul Post...

788
00:49:31.947 --> 00:49:34.307
started to have doubts about this death.

789
00:49:34.317 --> 00:49:36.277
He definitely died from a car accident,

790
00:49:37.287 --> 00:49:40.477
but there were contusions all over the boy's body.

791
00:49:41.657 --> 00:49:44.047
But one side covered it up.

792
00:49:44.527 --> 00:49:46.787
They were pressured by a certain foundation.

793
00:49:46.937 --> 00:49:47.987
Foundation?

794
00:49:47.987 --> 00:49:49.917
The reporter who buried that article...

795
00:49:50.437 --> 00:49:52.257
received help...

796
00:49:53.507 --> 00:49:55.727
from that foundation 10 years later...

797
00:49:56.307 --> 00:49:58.197
when his wife needed a heart transplant.

798
00:49:59.577 --> 00:50:02.617
The surgery was completely off the books,

799
00:50:02.617 --> 00:50:04.837
leaving zero trace in insurance and hospital records.

800
00:50:05.487 --> 00:50:06.857
That's ridiculous.

801
00:50:06.857 --> 00:50:08.307
The director of the foundation...

802
00:50:09.627 --> 00:50:11.277
that provided that help...

803
00:50:12.557 --> 00:50:14.647
is the father of Noah's Cho Young Ki.

804
00:50:16.027 --> 00:50:17.967
Do you know what the father...

805
00:50:17.967 --> 00:50:20.147
of Noah's Cho Young Ki did?

806
00:50:20.147 --> 00:50:21.487
(Sahae Foundation Meeting Log)

807
00:50:21.487 --> 00:50:24.287
When Nam Kang Myung supported the Faith Center,

808
00:50:24.767 --> 00:50:27.637
the money came from a place called the Sahae Foundation.

809
00:50:27.637 --> 00:50:29.027
Sahae Foundation?

810
00:50:29.247 --> 00:50:32.027
But the head of that foundation...

811
00:50:32.107 --> 00:50:33.867
is the father of Noah's Cho Young Ki.

812
00:50:33.917 --> 00:50:35.727
He worked under the Vice Minister of the CIA,

813
00:50:35.727 --> 00:50:38.837
and became the Assistant Minister for the National Security Agency.

814
00:50:38.987 --> 00:50:40.467
Faith Center...

815
00:50:41.087 --> 00:50:43.377
Wasn't it a place for homeless children?

816
00:50:46.557 --> 00:50:49.777
Why are such big wheel figures involved with this place?

817
00:50:50.667 --> 00:50:52.987
The Assistant Minister of the National Security Agency...

818
00:50:53.437 --> 00:50:55.087
provided funds for the Faith Center?

819
00:50:55.537 --> 00:50:57.757
He used Nam Kang Myung as his agent...

820
00:50:58.307 --> 00:51:00.327
to completely hide himself?

821
00:51:00.407 --> 00:51:01.587
Yes.

822
00:51:02.377 --> 00:51:03.527
And...

823
00:51:04.347 --> 00:51:06.267
a couple days before Chul Ho died,

824
00:51:07.717 --> 00:51:09.767
he was tracking all the articles...

825
00:51:10.617 --> 00:51:12.467
that I just told you about.

826
00:51:14.187 --> 00:51:15.437
Chul Ho...

827
00:51:17.057 --> 00:51:18.937
There are also traces of him...

828
00:51:20.897 --> 00:51:22.477
visiting that volunteer group you went to.

829
00:51:24.367 --> 00:51:26.247
Chul Ho visited that place?

830
00:51:30.907 --> 00:51:32.987
Yes, I remember.

831
00:51:34.177 --> 00:51:36.597
Wait a second. When was it?

832
00:51:38.147 --> 00:51:41.267
Anyways, a Daehan Newspaper reporter did come.

833
00:51:41.877 --> 00:51:45.137
He wanted to see photos of the Faith Center event.

837
00:52:08.337 --> 00:52:09.797
Isn't this Director Gu?

838
00:52:15.717 --> 00:52:18.237
He found out that the car accident was a cover-up for the murder...

839
00:52:18.237 --> 00:52:20.007
of the boy with the bruises.

840
00:52:20.517 --> 00:52:23.777
And he took down the article when the Sahae Foundation pressured him.

841
00:52:24.027 --> 00:52:26.947
He received their help for his wife's heart transplant.

842
00:52:27.197 --> 00:52:30.747
Only one person had private meetings with the son of Sahae Foundation,

843
00:52:32.167 --> 00:52:33.317
Cho Young Ki.

844
00:52:39.377 --> 00:52:40.927
It's Director Gu Tae Won of Daehan Newspaper.

845
00:52:45.577 --> 00:52:47.097
There was a wreath...

846
00:52:49.347 --> 00:52:50.767
at Chul Ho's funeral...

847
00:52:51.887 --> 00:52:53.307

You already knew it was him.

849
00:52:59.597 --> 00:53:02.307
But why didn't you tell me?

850
00:53:02.327 --> 00:53:04.517
Because I had to make sure it wasn't just suspicion.

851
00:53:06.037 --> 00:53:07.447
All the evidence...

852
00:53:09.437 --> 00:53:11.117
had to point towards him.

853
00:53:16.007 --> 00:53:18.997
I'm so sick of reporters.

854
00:53:25.017 --> 00:53:26.207
I'm sorry...

855
00:53:27.587 --> 00:53:29.937
- that it took so long.
- Yes.

856
00:53:30.827 --> 00:53:32.747
You have to be sorry to me.

857
00:53:34.497 --> 00:53:36.917
You stood in front of the man who killed my brother for five years,

858
00:53:36.917 --> 00:53:38.277
but you didn't do anything.

859
00:53:39.337 --> 00:53:41.287
Meanwhile, my life was ruined.

860
00:53:43.507 --> 00:53:46.127
Memories of my brother were shattered.

861
00:53:48.837 --> 00:53:50.097
And the Chul Ho I knew...

862
00:53:55.347 --> 00:53:56.967
the Chul Ho I miss...

863
00:53:59.887 --> 00:54:01.807
is now nowhere to be found.

864

No.

865
00:54:06.297 --> 00:54:08.307
Chul Ho is in the last article...

866
00:54:09.527 --> 00:54:10.717
that you have yet to see.

867
00:54:12.327 --> 00:54:14.447
Chul Ho figured out...

868
00:54:14.837 --> 00:54:18.157
that the articles he falsified was all for the Faith Center's sake.

869
00:54:19.207 --> 00:54:21.057
I'm sure he wanted to atone.

870
00:54:21.607 --> 00:54:23.427
So he tracked them down until the very end.

871
00:54:24.707 --> 00:54:26.227
And that's why he was murdered.

872
00:54:27.917 --> 00:54:29.497
