3
00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:09.411
Why are you so quiet?

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.381
Don't you want to go?

5
00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:13.221
Do you like working at the company more?

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.920
I...

7
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:18.090
- I'm... - Seo Ji An.

8
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.630
No.

9
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:23.391
Choi Eun Seok.

10
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.461
Eun Seok.

11
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:28.400
Go study abroad.

12
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.441
You couldn't do it because you lived in that house.

13
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.580
Do Kyung, are you sure?

14
00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:43.711
It looks like she doesn't want to go.

15
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.351
No, I think she's just shocked.

16
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.650
Do Kyung, please tell her.

17
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:51.190
It's my surprise gift for you.

18
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.891
I didn't expect you to be so shocked.

19
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.230
I wanted to go study art.

20
00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.561
A sculptor.

21
00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:00.260
I wanted to be a sculptor...

22
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.230
like Niki de Saint Phalle who made...

23
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.401
Rodin scheming Camille Claudel look petty.

24
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.070
- Plans for Eun Seok? - Yes.

25
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.811
I'm wondering what you're planning to do with her...

26
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.981
after you reveal her to the public.

27
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.880
Are you going to continue to teach her business?

28
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.781
We haven't decided yet.

29
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:23.291
We need to see her capacity beforehand.

30
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:27.160
And she's old enough. She should get married first.

31
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.731
She should get ready for it.

32
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.501
What about sending her to study abroad?

33
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.770
Study abroad?

34
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:35.970
To study art.

35
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.671
She said she wanted to study sculpting.

36
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:42.641
And Mom always wanted to open an art gallery.

37
00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:45.011
Opening a gallery for her after her studies...

38
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.850
is good for Eun Seok and it fulfills your dream.

39
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.080
Did she say she wants to go study abroad?

40
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.720
No. I just thought that she's too obsessed...

41
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.891
with the 40th anniversary event.

42
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.391
I know you want her to meet our expectations,

43
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.391
but she wanted to study art.

44
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.960
I don't think she is doing work for fun.

45
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:05.931
We should help her to accomplish her dream...

46
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:08.130
to make her feel satisfied with joining the family.

47
00:02:09.401 --> 00:02:10.931
It'll also help her to find a fiance.

48
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.070
I was worried that it wouldn't be easy...

49
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:16.741
to find someone for her because of her age.

50
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:19.440
What do you think, Honey?

51
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.950
I was also worried about her future.

52
00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:25.850
She'd like studying abroad,

53
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.790
but we'd have to stay apart again.

54
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:32.320
We should bare it for a greater outcome.

55
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.790
We should tell her now to cheer her up.

56
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.931
How about we surprise her?

57
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:46.341
My acting must've been so good.

58
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:49.070
She was so scared that she followed me in silence.

59
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.480
And we only made it worse.

60
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.341
We're sorry.

61
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:58.720
Oh, dear. Eun Seok.

62
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.290
She must be so happy.

63
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.021
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:16.045
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

65
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:28.380
Eun Seok.

66
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.081
I'm getting changed. I'm going to get a shower.

67
00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:32.880
Is that so?

68
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.890
Why is she like that?

69
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:49.401
Don't you think she has changed?

70
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.540
She was pretty bright when she started to work,

71
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.910
but she's completely frozen now.

72
00:03:55.341 --> 00:03:56.410
She used to be an employee on contract,

73
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.380
but she needs to take care of such a big project now.

74
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.711
Of course she's scared.

75
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.081
Is it too much for her?

76
00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:05.950
She didn't have enough time to adjust.

77
00:04:06.081 --> 00:04:08.420
She's nervous because she's trying.

78
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.021
She wants to succeed the anniversary event.

79
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.561
I'm sure she'll be fine.

80
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.460
Right. I can tell that she's your daughter.

81
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.630
I'm going to read some books in the study.

82
00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:40.580
("Casablanca")

83
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.690
("Casablanca")

84
00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:16.650
- Hey. - Yes?

85
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:18.690
I love you.

86
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:22.161
Thank you.

87
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:25.101
The man...

88
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:29.171
I really love...

89
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.820
Are you all right?

90
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:56.361
Why did you call me out if you're so worried?

91
00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:30.291
- Chuck flap tail, please. - Okay.

92
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.731
Hey. That's way too expensive.

93
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:35.830
Pork belly, please.

94
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.471
Oh, I'm sorry.

95
00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:39.871
We don't serve pork.

96
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:42.671
- Chuck flap tail, please. - Okay.

97
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.481
Why did you want to come here?

98
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.950
The doctor said you have to eat healthy.

99
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:52.221
You've lost so much weight.

100
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.101
Whatever.

101
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.801
Let's try it.

102
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.940
Soo A.

103
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.260
What is this?

104
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:35.361
Why would you bring the rings? I should do this.

105
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.330
Because I was the desperate one.

106
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:46.971
My situation...

107
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.871
hasn't changed at all.

108
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:53.041
Do you think I don't know?

109
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:55.851
When I got my job,

110
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.221
my grandmother passed away...

111
00:07:58.981 --> 00:07:59.981
due to stomach cancer.

112
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:03.491
I used my rent deposit...

113
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:06.260
to pay for Grandma's surgery.

114
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.561
When I got the semi-basement rent,

115
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.330
I told myself...

116
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:16.171
that I should never get married.

117
00:08:18.241 --> 00:08:19.340
My father...

118
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.241
had fallen after he got old.

119
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:26.840
But I had to start with a big debt...

120
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.411
when I'm not even 30.

121
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.390
I had no other choice.

122
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.451
I was born as the oldest child of this family.

123
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:46.231
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.441
A guy like me is stopping you from leaving.

125
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:56.971
We can rent a place...

126
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:58.410
with what we spend at the comic book store.

127
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.510
As long as we don't have a kid,

128
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.581
we can manage with what we both earn.

129
00:09:08.751 --> 00:09:13.390
Well, what do you think about living in my house?

130
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.691
How?

131
00:09:16.691 --> 00:09:18.060
Is there a spare room?

132
00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:31.410
Eun Seok.

133
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:35.351
She left.

134
00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:40.420
She left early again? When?

135
00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:42.221
About 30 minutes ago.

136
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.660
I saw her going down when I came out for a shower.

137
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:46.290
30 minutes?

138
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.961
(Mom from Daebang-dong, Dad from Daebang-dong)

139
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.941
(Mom from Daebang-dong)

140
00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:36.010
(Mom)

141
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.111
(Dad from Daebang-dong)

142
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:38.581

143
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.650
(Father)

144
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.481
(Vice Chairman)

145
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:48.550
(Mother)

146
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.461
(CEO)

147
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.701
(Do Kyung)

148
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.581
(Opening 11am, Closing 10pm)

149
00:11:42.741 --> 00:11:44.040
Hyuk.

150
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:50.751
Hi.

151
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.221
Why are you here?

152
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.550
I just came to visit you.

153
00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:58.991
You should leave.

154
00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:07.231
Have breakfast with me, please.

155
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.670
I'm starving.

156
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.130
I should've given you some of mine.

157
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.501
No, I don't get to eat regularly.

158
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.471
I had to eat when I could, so it became a habit.

159
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:51.010
You dressed up like you always have fancy meals.

160
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.241
But it looked like you haven't eaten for days.

161
00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:55.010
What?

162
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.880
I didn't starve.

163
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.081
But I just couldn't eat well for a few days.

164
00:13:00.081 --> 00:13:01.091
Why?

165
00:13:04.221 --> 00:13:06.890
I know I'm asking for too much,

166
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:09.731
but I hope you won't ask me anything.

167
00:13:12.001 --> 00:13:13.601
You won't answer even if I ask?

168
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.501
Take your time. You'll upset your stomach.

169
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:34.280
I don't know where you are or what you are doing.

170
00:13:34.621 --> 00:13:36.890
But for what are you being like this?

171
00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:41.290
Your outfit became fancy now,

172
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.030
but you look miserable.

173
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.101
"Why and how did I end up here?"

174
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.670
That's what I'm thinking about now.

175
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.140
Do you like me?

176
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.841
What?

177
00:13:55.071 --> 00:13:57.341
Don't act so surprised. It's insulting.

178
00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.711
I know that you don't like me,

179
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:01.780
but I can't come up with a reason why you'd loiter...

180
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.581
around where the guy you don't even like works.

181
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.050
Number one.

182
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.121
You're the only person I could visit.

183
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.591
What?

184
00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:11.721
Number two.

185
00:14:11.821 --> 00:14:14.121
I needed someone whom I can speak as Seo Ji An.

186
00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:16.290
Number three.

187
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:19.231
I needed someone whom I could eat with at ease,

188
00:14:19.461 --> 00:14:20.861
and you're the only person I could do so.

189
00:14:21.601 --> 00:14:22.701
Number four.

190
00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:24.670
You will be angry for a while,

191
00:14:24.871 --> 00:14:26.441
but you will forgive me in the end.

192
00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:27.601
Which one would you like better?

193
00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:29.211
What are you talking about?

194
00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.880
Did you forget that you sent money,

195
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.040
and didn't leave a number to never see me again?

196
00:14:43.221 --> 00:14:44.721
I choose all.

197
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.430
Give me your phone.

198
00:14:58.741 --> 00:15:00.201
If you want,

199
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:02.310
I'll just listen without asking any questions.

200
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.880
Call me if you need ears for your story.

201
00:15:04.981 --> 00:15:06.581
Try not to carry all of your burden by yourself.

202
00:15:07.951 --> 00:15:09.581
I won't accept your apology.

203
00:15:15.221 --> 00:15:16.221
Then...

204
00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:20.961
Thank you, Hyuk!

205
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.400
Now, don't I look like the Ji An you used to know?

206
00:15:29.731 --> 00:15:31.341
Seriously.

207
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.180
(Plain Bread)

208
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.780
(Sponge Cake with Bread?)

209
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:43.611
(Owner of Cafe, Hee)

210
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:47.351
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:49.550
A group of customers?

212
00:15:49.951 --> 00:15:52.461
Right now? You need eight?

213
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:53.991
Tell her we can provide with whatever she needs.

214
00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:55.231
- Tell her we can. - Yes, we can.

215
00:15:55.231 --> 00:15:58.030
I'll deliver them right now. Okay.

216
00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.560
It's the owner from the cafe.

217
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.201
I know. Where are the plastic bags?

218
00:16:01.201 --> 00:16:03.170
Hurry. Come on.

219
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.640
Keep wrapping.

220
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.540
Here you go. Put this in.

221
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.810
That's it. Go on now.

222
00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:19.150
2 cups of Vanilla Latte, 3 cups of Americano,

223
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.550
and two cups of Caffe Latte.

224
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.991
Give the Americanos first.

225
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.361
You shouldn't mix up with other orders.

226
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.900
- Your coffee is here. - All right.

227
00:16:41.371 --> 00:16:42.741
Here's your coffee.

228
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.050
Only two cups of Caffe Latte are left.

229
00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:54.821
How did you remember all of that?

230
00:16:54.821 --> 00:16:57.150
Well, I used to work at a cafe.

231
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.560
I'm the master of part-time jobs.

232
00:16:59.191 --> 00:17:01.160
Thank you so much.

233
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.530
I would've been in trouble without your help.

234
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.001
I'll get going now.

235
00:17:06.001 --> 00:17:07.360
I'll see you tomorrow.

236
00:17:07.501 --> 00:17:08.501
Bye.

237
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.401
Hello, good morning.

238
00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:19.941
Please serve these to table three.

239
00:17:23.911 --> 00:17:25.620
Goodness. This...

240
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.550
Give this to the girl from the bakery. This is hers.

241
00:17:34.461 --> 00:17:35.590
Excuse me!

242
00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:49.171
(Bouillabaisse and ciabatta)

243
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:50.340
(Focaccia sandwich with feta cheese)

244
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.151
I did it! I said hello to him!

245
00:18:02.151 --> 00:18:03.651
The bread helped me!

246
00:18:03.651 --> 00:18:05.391
I knew it. The bread is on my side.

247
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.760
But why are you so late?

248
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.661
I'm sorry. She had a lot of customers.

249
00:18:11.661 --> 00:18:13.931
She was beside herself,

250
00:18:13.931 --> 00:18:15.431
so I had to help her.

251
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.171
I'm sorry I didn't ask for your permission.

252
00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:21.911
There's no need for my permission.

253
00:18:21.941 --> 00:18:23.110
That's not necessary.

254
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.550
Yes, I'm working on the winter products' concept.

255
00:18:32.481 --> 00:18:34.991
I'll report about it soon, Vice President Choi.

256
00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:37.020
Yes, sir.

257
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.830
What is it? Do you have something to tell me?

258
00:18:42.161 --> 00:18:44.401
I'd like additional employees assigned...

259
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:46.260
for the 40th anniversary event.

260
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.770
It's too much for me to handle alone.

261
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.040
I guess the size of the event is too big.

262
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.441
Who would you like to work with then?

263
00:18:55.441 --> 00:18:56.610
Ms. Yoon Ha Jung.

264
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.481
- Yoon Ha Jung? - Yes?

265
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:04.881
Do you really mean that?

266
00:19:04.881 --> 00:19:06.580
When I wasn't here,

267
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.721
she was in charge of the proposal,

268
00:19:08.951 --> 00:19:11.921
so she must know it better than anyone else.

269
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:15.391
Ms. Yoon.

270
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.860
Ji An wants you to prepare the event with her.

271
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.001
What?

272
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.840
What's your plan, Ji An?

273
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.671
What do you mean?

274
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.971
Succeeding the event will raise your ratings much.

275
00:19:31.241 --> 00:19:33.310
You wouldn't want to give me that opportunity.

276
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.181
You want to see me struggle, don't you?

277
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.951
It's for the company.

278
00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.991
It's a very important event,

279
00:19:42.151 --> 00:19:45.921
so I just wanted to prepare for everything.

280
00:19:46.421 --> 00:19:47.760
What do you mean by "everything"?

281
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.231
What if I suddenly die by a car accident?

282
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.461
What?

283
00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:52.961
There's no guarantee that it won't happen.

284
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:56.401
If I suddenly get sick, hurt,

285
00:19:57.171 --> 00:19:58.201
or disappeared somehow,

286
00:19:59.001 --> 00:20:01.310
it would be a big problem.

287
00:20:01.941 --> 00:20:03.110
So...

288
00:20:03.641 --> 00:20:05.540
I thought someone else...

289
00:20:05.741 --> 00:20:07.951
should know what's going on.

290
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.610
You're unbelievably responsible, aren't you?

291
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.221
Didn't you know how responsible I am?

292
00:20:12.651 --> 00:20:13.850
So would you do it or not?

293
00:20:14.951 --> 00:20:16.391
All right. I'll do it.

294
00:20:16.391 --> 00:20:18.721
But you must work hard.

295
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:20.020
You can't be half-hearted.

296
00:20:20.391 --> 00:20:23.661
Then put my name on the promotional video too.

297
00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:25.661
All right.

298
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.870
- Say we co-directed it. - Okay.

299
00:20:27.971 --> 00:20:30.131
You really are going to make me the co-director?

300
00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:32.300
But you must know as much as I do,

301
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.870
and you must be as responsible as I am.

302
00:20:34.241 --> 00:20:35.310
You must be able...

303
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:37.981
to finish the event even without me. Okay?

304
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.481
Okay.

305
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.651
What happened?

306
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.850
Ms. Yoon and I decided to work together.

307
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.921
Ji An.

308
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.830
Are you really going to make her the co-director?

309
00:20:56.191 --> 00:20:58.030
- Yes. - What?

310
00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.901
But you have other people too.

311
00:20:59.901 --> 00:21:01.070
Mr. Jo.

312
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.270
What's wrong with you all?

313
00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:06.441
You shouldn't bring your personal life into work.

314
00:21:06.441 --> 00:21:07.570
Shouldn't you do so too?

315
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.671
Ji An is such a nice person.

316
00:21:10.941 --> 00:21:14.010
Study these copies of my research data.

317
00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.181
All of these?

318
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.820
Ms. Yoon and I will go discuss the schedule.

319
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.520
Get your file, and follow me.

320
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.221
Right now? Already?

321
00:21:25.391 --> 00:21:27.691
We will finish the event promotion by the 16th.

322
00:21:27.691 --> 00:21:30.131
By the 19th, we will hire people for the event...

323
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:31.760
through the agencies and sign contracts.

324
00:21:32.131 --> 00:21:33.600
We will constantly check the progress...

325
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:36.731
and finish everything by the 23rd.

326
00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:37.901
The 23rd?

327
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:39.270
Why would you hurry so much?

328
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.540
We just need to check everything before d-day.

329
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.570
Wouldn't it be better to finish it beforehand?

330
00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:45.641
Anyway, this is our schedule.

331
00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:47.411
You take care of the customer model...

332
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:48.681
fashion show and the C'est Si Bon concert.

333
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.211
I will take care of the hand-printing contest,

334
00:21:50.211 --> 00:21:52.780
natural dye workshop, and the rest.

335
00:21:53.421 --> 00:21:54.850
Until the 23rd,

336
00:21:55.191 --> 00:21:56.620
we have to finish everything.

337
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.991
Ji An, do you die on the 23rd?

338
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.891
We still have a full week.

339
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:04.260
It's the 23rd.

340
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.030
This is the deadline. You should never forget.

341
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.370
Now that you're a regular employee...

342
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.931
and the vice president loves you,

343
00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:11.941
you are giving everything you have.

344
00:22:11.941 --> 00:22:14.770
I will promote it through newspapers and magazines.

345
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:16.310
You make the posters and catalogues.

346
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:18.881
Right. And did you send...

347
00:22:18.981 --> 00:22:20.280
text messages to all of our customers...

348
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.050
about the event?

349
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.350
Of course I did.

350
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.620
All right.

351
00:22:24.681 --> 00:22:26.681
I'm going out for a while. Call me if you need me.

352
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.590
- Where are you going? - This event...

353
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.391
will be included in our promotional video.

354
00:22:30.721 --> 00:22:32.560
One of our events on old memories lack substance,

355
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.991
so I'm going to do some research.

356
00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.760
Why is she so determined?

357
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.370
Taxi.

358
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.070
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:58.881 --> 00:23:02.520
(Withdrawal slip)

360
00:23:12.631 --> 00:23:15.971
(Korea office, Seo Tae Soo)

361
00:23:22.211 --> 00:23:23.810
(Korea office, Seo Tae Soo)

362
00:23:27.681 --> 00:23:29.451
(Ji Tae)

363
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:32.751
Hello, Ji Tae.

364
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.221
Dad, when are you coming home today?

365
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.661
The store is so lovely.

366
00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:43.731
I'm so jealous of you.

367
00:23:44.661 --> 00:23:45.731
- Hold on. - What?

368
00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.931
Okay, hold on.

369
00:23:50.131 --> 00:23:51.840
Hello? It's me.

370
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.270
Ji Tae?

371
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.350
(Do Kyung)

372
00:24:05.981 --> 00:24:07.280
Hello, Mr. Choi.

373
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.290
Where are you?

374
00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:09.790
I am at Heyri, Paju.

375
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.491
You could've taken the driver to go that far.

376
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.491
You work at the marketing department now,

377
00:24:14.491 --> 00:24:16.131
but you are not just any staff.

378
00:24:16.131 --> 00:24:18.760
Okay. But I have to go in now.

379
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.530
Is that so? Okay. Come in then.

380
00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:22.131
What?

381
00:24:29.711 --> 00:24:30.911
This is insane.

382
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.620
What are you doing here?

383
00:24:40.721 --> 00:24:41.951
You told me to come here.

384
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.360
When did I say that?

385
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.191
You cried when I told you to go study abroad,

386
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:48.090
disappeared early in the morning,

387
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:49.530
and ignored my calls.

388
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.600
"I'm troubled, brother."

389
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.661
Weren't you silently calling for my help?

390
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.131
You did have reasons to think that way.

391
00:24:57.471 --> 00:25:00.070
By the way, how did you come here?

392
00:25:00.241 --> 00:25:01.810
I am your boss.

393
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:03.211
I am the vice president.

394
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.911
Let's go in.

395
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.020
They've recreated an old street.

396
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.961
But why are we here?

397
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.030
It has nothing to do with the event.

398
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.330
The event will be included in our promotional video,

399
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.330
but we lack retro items.

400
00:25:26.701 --> 00:25:29.231
I thought perhaps we could use these as our backdrop.

401
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.340
Look, it's an electronics shop.

402
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.641
(Radio, phonograph, TV, and antenna)

403
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:45.320
When is this from? Gosh.

404
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.830
(Seoul Pawnshop)

405
00:25:58.661 --> 00:25:59.901
(Pub)

406
00:26:00.701 --> 00:26:02.600
(Daejeon Barbershop)

407
00:26:10.911 --> 00:26:12.681
Take a picture of me.

408
00:26:13.441 --> 00:26:14.451
Wait.

409
00:26:18.481 --> 00:26:20.820
What's this? Gosh, it stinks.

410
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:33.560
You didn't even care when I was trying to act cute.

411
00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.270
You should've put on the wig too.

412
00:26:40.001 --> 00:26:41.241
But someone else had worn it.

413
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.671
Do you never use anything...

414
00:26:44.411 --> 00:26:46.381
previously used by other people?

415
00:26:46.481 --> 00:26:47.510
Of course not.

416
00:26:48.651 --> 00:26:51.080
Then how do you eat food at restaurants?

417
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.320
The plates and cutleries had been previously used.

418
00:26:53.421 --> 00:26:55.090
They wash those.

419
00:26:55.191 --> 00:26:57.991
You should stop eating food from anywhere too.

420
00:26:59.921 --> 00:27:01.760
It's different from what I saw on blogs.

421
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.691
It won't be feasible to decorate with these.

422
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:05.360
They have so many fascinating things here.

423
00:27:13.741 --> 00:27:15.070
It's 3D.

424
00:27:22.151 --> 00:27:23.151
Here.

425
00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.651
When you can't stand it anymore, tell me.

426
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:32.260
Come here. There's something really fun.

427
00:27:36.491 --> 00:27:37.530
Look.

428
00:27:40.701 --> 00:27:42.001
I'll take a picture of you.

429
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:43.600
Me?

430
00:27:43.901 --> 00:27:45.501
Nobody here knows you anyway.

431
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.211
Hurry up then.

432
00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.141
Take the picture. Here.

433
00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:14.770
Stay still for a moment.

434
00:28:15.431 --> 00:28:16.870
Like this?

435
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:18.840
Put your arm inside like this.

436
00:28:19.171 --> 00:28:20.171
Like this?

437
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.911
Hey, come here. Let's do this together.

438
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:31.320
I came to help my sister, but I ended up having fun.

439
00:28:32.651 --> 00:28:33.850
I'm glad.

440
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.451
I know much about art,

441
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.760
but I was never interested in sculptures.

442
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.260
But these days, I'm taking interest in these.

443
00:28:45.231 --> 00:28:46.731
If you study abroad and become a sculptor,

444
00:28:47.661 --> 00:28:50.600
let's put your artwork in front of our building.

445
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.171
I'll take a bus from here.

446
00:28:57.441 --> 00:28:58.481
Eun Seok.

447
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.010
Why do you keep leaving so early in the morning?

448
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.951
You didn't even answer my calls today.

449
00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:07.221
Is something bothering you?

450
00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:10.421
It's just that I wake up early.

451
00:29:10.421 --> 00:29:11.760
When I sit in the park,

452
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.790
I can think about work more clearly,

453
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.231
so I just leave early.

454
00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:18.001
Don't you want to go study abroad?

455
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.931
I am not skillful enough...

456
00:29:21.131 --> 00:29:22.731
to think about something else...

457
00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:24.270
when one thought gets held in my head.

458
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.171
Right now,

459
00:29:26.171 --> 00:29:27.870
preparing for the event is hard enough.

460
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:29.840
That's not that important.

461
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.381
You don't have to do it well.

462
00:29:31.941 --> 00:29:33.040
Hey,

463
00:29:33.411 --> 00:29:35.610
where did that feisty Seo Ji An go?

464
00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:37.881
I just...

465
00:29:38.921 --> 00:29:40.481
wanted to do well.

466
00:29:40.481 --> 00:29:42.620
You don't have to do well.

467
00:29:42.721 --> 00:29:45.491
Your performance doesn't affect you.

468
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.090
You are the little sister of Haesung Group's heir.

469
00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:49.760
Why can't you get away from your past?

470
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.060
It's for my own reasons.

471
00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.800
I want to succeed this project.

472
00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:59.241
That's all I can think about right now.

473
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.171
I can't understand you.

474
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.141
It'd be better to go separately.

475
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:07.181
I will just take the bus.

476
00:30:08.151 --> 00:30:10.110
I can drop you off at the back of our office.

477
00:30:33.471 --> 00:30:36.171
Why are you moving Ji Ho's things?

478
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.040
It should look spacious and clean.

479
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.681
They will be staying here when they get married.

480
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.481
Is Ji Tae getting married?

481
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.120
Isn't he just introducing his girlfriend to us?

482
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.020
Why would he introduce her to us...

483
00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.691
if they're not getting married?

484
00:30:51.161 --> 00:30:52.590
How about Ji Ho then?

485
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.461
What will happen when he finishes the exam?

486
00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.100
Let's talk about that after we talk to Ji Tae.

487
00:31:07.171 --> 00:31:08.211
Are we there yet?

488
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.411
We are here.

489
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:12.481
It's over there.

490
00:31:16.751 --> 00:31:17.850
I am nervous.

491
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.191
You are famous for being emotionless.

492
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.350
And you're nervous?

493
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.691
Even though the ocean looks calm,

494
00:31:23.691 --> 00:31:25.391
it's very dynamic beneath.

495
00:31:27.661 --> 00:31:28.790
You don't need to be nervous.

496
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.231
They will like you as soon as they see you.

497
00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:32.461
Especially my dad.

498
00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.770
Ji Tae is so funny.

499
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.441
He's being so coy.

500
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.641
Why would he advertise his love story?

501
00:31:43.741 --> 00:31:45.941
It's so obvious that you've never dated.

502
00:31:46.641 --> 00:31:49.381
How do you know if I've never dated?

503
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.421
A woman who has ever dated a man...

504
00:31:51.421 --> 00:31:53.820
would never wear her hair in pigtails.

505
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.391
Especially curly pigtails.

506
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:57.691
What's wrong with my pigtails?

507
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.161
Is this that bad?

508
00:32:01.891 --> 00:32:04.191
It's not for a woman. It's for a little girl.

509
00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:07.661
You mean I don't look feminine?

510
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.231
Right. You should change your hair now...

511
00:32:10.231 --> 00:32:11.471
and be like a proper lady.

512
00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.370
- We're here. - Welcome.

513
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.171
- Welcome. - Hello.

514
00:32:19.441 --> 00:32:20.711
This is Lee Soo A.

515
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:22.580
These are my parents.

516
00:32:22.681 --> 00:32:24.050
This is Ji Soo, and this is Ji Ho.

517
00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:27.120
Nice to meet you. My name is Lee Soo A.

518
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:28.520
It's nice to meet you.

519
00:32:28.651 --> 00:32:31.120
I am Ji Tae's youngest brother, Seo Ji Ho.

520
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:33.221
And my name is Seo Ji Soo.

521
00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:35.760
Nice to meet you too.

522
00:32:44.231 --> 00:32:46.701
My parents moved to Canada...

523
00:32:46.701 --> 00:32:49.211
with my brother 10 years ago.

524
00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.481
And I live in a female-only apartment.

525
00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:53.911
My goodness.

526
00:32:54.241 --> 00:32:55.911
You live in a female-only apartment.

527
00:32:55.911 --> 00:32:57.550
You're quite a lady.

528
00:32:58.181 --> 00:32:59.481
Not really.

529
00:32:59.481 --> 00:33:01.191
I just get scared easily.

530
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:03.020
I don't have much money either.

531
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:06.290
We don't have money either.

532
00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.191
But Ji Tae, you dated for four years.

533
00:33:09.191 --> 00:33:10.961
Why did you never tell us about her?

534
00:33:11.161 --> 00:33:13.030
Why would you ask that?

535
00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:14.401
That's his privacy.

536
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.171
I used to not believe in marriage.

537
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.401
You didn't believe in marriage?

538
00:33:18.971 --> 00:33:20.641
What do you mean?

539
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.941
I had no plans of getting married.

540
00:33:23.211 --> 00:33:25.381
But after dating Ji Tae for four years,

541
00:33:25.381 --> 00:33:27.780
I realized that he is so consistent and lovely.

542
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:30.080
So I asked him to marry me.

543
00:33:33.751 --> 00:33:35.120
Thank you.

544
00:33:37.691 --> 00:33:39.620
I thank you too. We don't have anything to offer.

545
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.991
I heard young women these days want rich men.

546
00:33:45.701 --> 00:33:47.901
Well, if I move in with him,

547
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:49.731
I wouldn't spend so much money anyway.

548
00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:53.300
Are you really going to move in here?

549
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.550
Your room is more spacious than I expected.

550
00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.290
You are very tidy, aren't you?

551
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:13.160
Did Mom clean up?

552
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.191
I like this room. I love it.

553
00:34:17.591 --> 00:34:19.031
Did you just say that you love it?

554
00:34:19.861 --> 00:34:21.231
It's separated into two floors,

555
00:34:21.231 --> 00:34:22.770
and it feels private.

556
00:34:25.001 --> 00:34:27.501
Okay. After 1 or 2 years,

557
00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:29.470
we should save up and move out.

558
00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:34.810
Take care.

559
00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:37.381
We will. Take care of yourself too.

560
00:34:44.051 --> 00:34:46.060
Mom, if Ji Tae moves in,

561
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.321
what will happen to Ji Ho?

562
00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.131
We already made a deal.

563
00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:52.501
His marriage is important,

564
00:34:52.501 --> 00:34:54.001
so please understand.

565
00:34:54.001 --> 00:34:55.370
I will do whatever I can...

566
00:34:56.071 --> 00:34:57.631
to get you a room.

567
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.410
Mom, you don't know...

568
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.341
that I'm so thrilled about moving out, do you?

569
00:35:06.441 --> 00:35:08.251
Really?

570
00:35:08.281 --> 00:35:10.810
You have such a narrow view.

571
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.220
My sister-in-law saved both Ji Tae and me.

572
00:35:13.821 --> 00:35:14.921
She's the best.

573
00:35:16.321 --> 00:35:17.450
I will help you.

574
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.481
What are you doing? Why did you close the window?

575
00:35:47.821 --> 00:35:49.720
Your voice has gone a little hoarse.

576
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.160
The wind is bad for your throat.

577
00:36:23.591 --> 00:36:25.520
You should walk ahead. Why are you following me?

578
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.290
I can't protect you if I walk ahead.

579
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.401
Let's go. I'll follow you.

580
00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.120
Mr. Baker.

581
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.151
I will be back by 10.

582
00:36:56.151 --> 00:36:58.761
What? But the bread comes out at 9:30.

583
00:36:58.761 --> 00:37:00.290
I am sorry. Please pack these alone...

584
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:01.691
until I return.

585
00:37:01.691 --> 00:37:04.231
Then can I bake my bread...

586
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:06.301
while the oven is resting?

587
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:07.830
Okay. Sure.

588
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.001
Yes!

589
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.671
Gosh, he looks great when he's dressed like that.

590
00:37:48.511 --> 00:37:50.310
Sunwoo Hee?

591
00:37:53.211 --> 00:37:55.281
I almost didn't recognize you.

592
00:37:55.281 --> 00:37:56.481
Long time no see.

593
00:37:57.551 --> 00:37:59.620
Don't you remember me?

594
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.290
I am Kang Nam Goo.

595
00:38:03.251 --> 00:38:05.490
I used to sell hotteok in front of your school.

596
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.761
Don't you remember me?

597
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.390
I remember you.

598
00:38:10.631 --> 00:38:11.861
Have you been well?

599
00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.631
Hello.

600
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.200
By the way, do you live in this town?

601
00:38:18.441 --> 00:38:21.040
No, I was just running an errand.

602
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.580
I see.

603
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.580
All right. Take care then.

604
00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.111
Hee, what's wrong?

605
00:39:02.781 --> 00:39:03.781
What?

606
00:39:05.751 --> 00:39:07.790
You look as if you just saw a ghost.

607
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.421
It's... It's nothing.

608
00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:27.540
Ji An works at the Haesung Marketing Team.

609
00:39:28.211 --> 00:39:29.870
It looks great.

610
00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:33.481
You're amazing, Ji An.

611
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:45.921
What?

612
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.060
Look who's here.

613
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.631
What?

614
00:40:00.171 --> 00:40:01.441
You...

615
00:40:02.071 --> 00:40:03.140
Do you remember me?

616
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.740
Of course I do. What are you doing here?

617
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.981
I'm here to see my sister.

618
00:40:09.511 --> 00:40:11.051
I'm here to see someone.

619
00:40:11.751 --> 00:40:13.651
You already said you're here to see your sister.

620
00:40:13.751 --> 00:40:15.321
No, that was a mistake.

621
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:17.450
Who are you meeting here?

622
00:40:19.091 --> 00:40:20.120
I...

623
00:40:21.231 --> 00:40:23.861
By the way, you're good at keeping secrets.

624
00:40:24.261 --> 00:40:25.430
Secrets?

625
00:40:27.631 --> 00:40:29.731
I didn't tell my sister that we met the other day?

626
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.071
We promised not to tell her about it.

627
00:40:32.071 --> 00:40:34.240
Since you're so good at keeping secrets,

628
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.910
Should I tell you? About why I'm here?

629
00:40:38.341 --> 00:40:39.841
This is unbelievable.

630
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.950
What? What is it?

631
00:40:45.751 --> 00:40:46.751
I'm...

632
00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.790
your sister's brother.

633
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.220
What?

634
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.620
I'm Ji An's brother.

635
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.591
Ji An's brother?

636
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:03.231
It really is unbelievable.

637
00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.511
Are you here to get Ji An some snacks?

638
00:41:19.281 --> 00:41:20.651
Lunch delivery.

639
00:41:20.651 --> 00:41:22.950
You're in the wrong room. I didn't order lunch.

640
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.761
You don't order this. This lunch comes to you.

641
00:41:28.461 --> 00:41:29.631
Ta-da!

642
00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.231
Did I surprise you?

643
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.731
Ji Soo.

644
00:41:36.001 --> 00:41:38.970
How did you get in here?

645
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:41.870
It's a secret. I can do many things.

646
00:41:43.211 --> 00:41:44.680
You're supposed to work now.

647
00:41:44.881 --> 00:41:46.481
What are you doing here at this hour?

648
00:41:46.481 --> 00:41:47.950
Mr. Baker said I could go.

649
00:41:47.981 --> 00:41:50.211
We're free during lunch time.

650
00:41:50.251 --> 00:41:52.921
The bread is usually sold out before 11am.

651
00:41:53.051 --> 00:41:55.321
We don't have anything to do until the afternoon.

652
00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:01.160
Are you here to give me the bread you baked?

653
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.091
I made some ciabatta sandwiches.

654
00:42:04.231 --> 00:42:05.430
It's really good.

655
00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:07.131
Don't take it out.

656
00:42:07.131 --> 00:42:09.430
I'll eat it outside. People will come soon.

657
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:12.441
Why? I just want to see you take a bite of it.

658
00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:14.740
Try it. Come on.

659
00:42:19.281 --> 00:42:20.441
What do you think?

660
00:42:22.611 --> 00:42:23.751
It's not good.

661
00:42:24.151 --> 00:42:25.950
Why? Is it bad?

662
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:28.751
It's really bad.

663
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.421
What? Hey, are you serious?

664
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:33.861
- Is it really that bad? - Yes.

665
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:35.861
Really?

666
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:37.901
I thought it was good.

667
00:42:40.301 --> 00:42:41.370
Has it gone bad?

668
00:42:44.131 --> 00:42:45.341
Poor Ji Soo.

669
00:42:45.841 --> 00:42:47.200
What should I do with you?

670
00:43:11.131 --> 00:43:12.131
This tastes good.

671
00:43:14.031 --> 00:43:16.031
Just go. You don't need to see me out.

672
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.671
Why are you staring at me like that?

673
00:43:24.611 --> 00:43:25.711
Ji Soo.

674
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.350
Go home safely.

675
00:43:29.251 --> 00:43:30.481
And...

676
00:43:31.381 --> 00:43:32.850
don't come to my office from now on.

677
00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.421
Okay. I get it.

678
00:43:35.421 --> 00:43:37.450
I just came here for my first time.

679
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.560
Stop trying to be a baker. It's not right for you.

680
00:43:43.361 --> 00:43:46.330
Hey, now that you're rich,

681
00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:47.870
you sound very arrogant.

682
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:51.171
You know I've come a long way to do this.

683
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.200
What do you know about bread?

684
00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:57.941
I guess you've eaten a lot of gourmet bread.

685
00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.950
You can do baking only as a hobby.

686
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.220
I was hoping to learn from Mr. Baker.

687
00:44:09.921 --> 00:44:12.020
- Just go. - Okay.

688
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:15.091
Ji An, Ji Tae is getting married.

689
00:44:16.031 --> 00:44:17.290
He's getting married?

690
00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:20.200
His girlfriend came to our house to meet us.

691
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.671
They've been dating for four years.

692
00:44:21.671 --> 00:44:23.370
How could he not tell us the whole time?

693
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:25.740
When is he getting married?

694
00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.111
You should ask how she was first, don't you think?

695
00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:31.111
So when is the wedding?

696
00:44:32.781 --> 00:44:34.281
They haven't set the date yet,

697
00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:35.680
but they say it will be soon.

698
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.680
By the way,

699
00:44:39.281 --> 00:44:41.990
your biological brother seems kind of cool.

700
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:44.120
My brother?

701
00:44:46.261 --> 00:44:48.731
Gosh, was I not supposed to tell you that too?

702
00:44:50.591 --> 00:44:53.861
How did you know he was my brother?

703
00:44:55.031 --> 00:44:58.441
My friend sent me a photo which took me by surprise.

704
00:44:58.441 --> 00:45:00.341
Isn't the man behind them Choi Do Kyung?

705
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.611
Why would the busy vice president go there?

706
00:45:02.611 --> 00:45:03.810
That is Choi Do Kyung.

707
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:06.341
- Unbelievable. - I'm 100 percent sure.

708
00:45:06.341 --> 00:45:07.981
Who is she then? His girlfriend?

709
00:45:07.981 --> 00:45:09.711
- I'm so envious. - Gosh, I know her.

710
00:45:09.711 --> 00:45:11.950
I was a contract worker with her two years ago.

711
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:13.180
- Really? - Can someone confirm?

712
00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.220
As far as I remember, her name is Seo Ji An.

713
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.890
Seo Ji An of the Marketing Team.

714
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:17.450
She was on the list of rejoining employees.

715
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:18.890
- Rejoining employees? - Rejoining employees?

716
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:21.830
He just got promoted to the vice president.

717
00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.361
Then he got his girlfriend a permanent position?

718
00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:25.531
I can't believe this.

719
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:27.731
It's been only 30 minutes, but the comments are...

720
00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:29.671
It has 1,520 hits already.

721
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:31.901
Gosh, this is overwhelming.

722
00:45:31.901 --> 00:45:33.801
That's because it was posted during lunch break.

723
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.140
What's the source, by the way?

724
00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.410
It doesn't matter.

725
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:38.111
What matters is the fact.

726
00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:42.481
Gosh, I knew it.

727
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.151
Vice President Choi kept getting on my nerves...

728
00:45:45.151 --> 00:45:47.551
and covering up for Seo Ji An.

729
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:49.990
So do you think Ji An and Vice President Choi...

730
00:45:50.321 --> 00:45:52.691
Is the girl in the photo in your team?

731
00:45:53.821 --> 00:45:55.691
- Yes. - She's Seo Ji An, right?

732
00:45:55.691 --> 00:45:57.631
The Giving Girl who was your contract worker.

733
00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:00.261
Seo Ji An is making me very popular.

734
00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:02.071
Right.

735
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.941
I found a news article. The couple in the photo.

736
00:46:05.941 --> 00:46:08.511
They look like Ji An and Vice President Choi.

737
00:46:08.511 --> 00:46:09.970
The figures look like them though.

738
00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.281
You went too far. You can't even see their face.

739
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:15.950
(The history of Korean chaebol's bossiness)

740
00:46:16.881 --> 00:46:18.450
What is that?

741
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.961
I told you.

742
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:27.790
I knew Seo Ji An was suspicious.

743
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:29.591
By the way,

744
00:46:30.861 --> 00:46:32.261
can you believe this?

745
00:46:35.031 --> 00:46:36.031
Gosh.

746
00:46:39.441 --> 00:46:41.441
Sir, you should see what's on the bulletin board.

747
00:46:41.671 --> 00:46:42.941
The bulletin board?

748
00:46:43.341 --> 00:46:46.040
I got a scoop while smoking a cigarette.

749
00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.481
Seo Ji An is getting off Vice President Choi's car.

750
00:46:48.481 --> 00:46:49.850
They're wearing the same clothes as in the photo.

751
00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:52.080
They got caught while going on a secret date.

752
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.390
Her name is Seo Ji An, and she's 28 years old.

753
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:57.350
A member of Haesung Apparel's Marketing Team.

754
00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:59.261
A contract worker becoming a wife of the head?

755
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:25.281
Now I know...

756
00:47:25.881 --> 00:47:27.821
why they chose your project proposal...

757
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:29.751
and why they hired you again.

758
00:47:29.751 --> 00:47:31.120
What are you talking about?

759
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:32.560
Ji An.

760
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:34.631
Come here.

761
00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.781
Who on earth did that?

762
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:00.281
(Mother)

763
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.060
How could you be so thoughtless?

764
00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:08.131
I told you to be careful before we announce it.

765
00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.761
I'm sorry.

766
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:14.160
The article about Korean chaebol...

767
00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.330
is being amplified with your photos.

768
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:18.401
But what are you going to say about these photos?

769
00:48:18.571 --> 00:48:21.240
People wouldn't believe it even if you denied...

770
00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.071
a rumor that you're dating our employee.

771
00:48:23.071 --> 00:48:24.781
But it's Eun Seok that we're talking about now.

772
00:48:24.781 --> 00:48:27.481
I'll have to say we went to the museum together...

773
00:48:27.781 --> 00:48:29.410
for our 40th anniversary event.

774
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:30.910
Do you think people would buy it?

775
00:48:31.251 --> 00:48:34.051
Eun Seok won't be able to proceed with her work.

776
00:48:34.551 --> 00:48:35.821
Our plan to reveal it...

777
00:48:35.821 --> 00:48:39.060
on the foundation day has come to nothing.

778
00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.691
What if we announce it sooner than planned?

779
00:48:44.191 --> 00:48:45.301
Sooner than planned?

780
00:48:45.301 --> 00:48:48.100
Even if reporters pry into the disappearance case,

781
00:48:48.231 --> 00:48:50.200
they won't find much.

782
00:48:51.441 --> 00:48:54.071
Eun Seok is already a full-time employee.

783
00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.410
We could say we were helping her...

784
00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.810
find her real family.

785
00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:58.941
No.

786
00:48:59.281 --> 00:49:01.180
The internet is too advanced.

787
00:49:01.751 --> 00:49:04.350
Reporters will do anything for a story.

788
00:49:04.481 --> 00:49:06.381
They'll try to reconstruct every detail...

789
00:49:06.381 --> 00:49:07.720
of what happened 25 years ago.

790
00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:12.890
They'll uncover every single detail...

791
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:14.691
of Eun Seok's past life.

792
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.631
(Father)

793
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:22.901
Hello, Dad.

794
00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:27.600
Call the board of directors now.

795
00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:29.941
We'll reveal her today.

796
00:49:31.341 --> 00:49:32.511
Dad.

797
00:49:32.511 --> 00:49:35.981
Rumors snowball with time. They never disappear.

798
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.720
If we can't keep this within the company,

799
00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.950
Do Kyung will end up...

800
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.591
looking like a man who dated his own sister.

801
00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:48.060
We can't go public right now.

802
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.531
We need to make up a story.

803
00:49:49.531 --> 00:49:51.660
The longer we take, the worse it'll get.

804
00:49:52.131 --> 00:49:54.870
We can't burn a house to get rid of a flea.

805
00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.001
Gather the directors now.

806
00:49:57.631 --> 00:49:59.240
I'll deal with the rest.

807
00:50:11.881 --> 00:50:12.881
Do Kyung.

808
00:50:12.881 --> 00:50:13.981
Eun Seok.

809
00:50:14.151 --> 00:50:15.321
Come to the conference room at 6pm.

810
00:50:15.321 --> 00:50:16.490
We're revealing you today.

811
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:19.120
What? You're going to do what?

812
00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.890
This isn't something we can cover up.

813
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.091
My grandfather wants to tell the truth...

814
00:50:23.091 --> 00:50:25.560
before people say I dated my sister.

815
00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.401
No, you can't do that.

816
00:50:27.401 --> 00:50:28.600
It's okay.

817
00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.770
We're just pulling forward our plans.

818
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.370
I must call the directors...

819
00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:35.111
to track who uploaded the photos. I'll hang up.

820
00:50:35.111 --> 00:50:37.171
No, wait, Do Kyung.

821
00:50:37.171 --> 00:50:39.281
Be there at 6pm. Don't be late.

822
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:45.151
What should I do?

823
00:50:46.051 --> 00:50:47.990
What now? Oh, no.

824
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.720
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

825
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:57.131
What should I do?

826
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:26.691
Eun Seok, where are you?

827
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.091
I got off the elevator.

828
00:51:33.631 --> 00:51:36.801
So all the directors are here.

829
00:51:38.171 --> 00:51:39.740
But where's the PR Team?

830
00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:40.901
Here, sir.

831
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.441
Who will take the photos?

832
00:51:43.441 --> 00:51:44.611
I will, sir.

833
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.180
Do well.

834
00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.180
Yes, sir.

835
00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.580
The reason I invited all directors,

836
00:51:54.321 --> 00:51:58.120
the PR Team who maintains...

837
00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.921
our company's website,

838
00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.031
and the staff to take photos...

839
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:05.600
is because of the rumor,

840
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.301
which you all know, circulating the internet.

841
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:18.080
I will get to the point.

842
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.080
Choi Do Kyung, the VP of Haesung Apparel...

843
00:52:22.611 --> 00:52:24.781
and the employee in the Marketing Team,

844
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.151
Seo Ji An...

845
00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:37.490
They are not dating.

846
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:38.631
They are...

847
00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:39.761
Sir.

848
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:42.770
If I may,

849
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:45.801
would you let me speak?

850
00:52:51.511 --> 00:52:52.611
Please, sir.

851
00:52:56.481 --> 00:52:57.551
Okay.

852
00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:09.560
Hello, everyone.

853
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:11.660
I am Seo Ji An from...

854
00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.261
Haesung Apparel's Marketing Team.

855
00:53:15.131 --> 00:53:17.801
I worked there for two years and left...

856
00:53:17.801 --> 00:53:18.941
when my contract was done,

857
00:53:18.941 --> 00:53:21.370
and I recently returned as a full-time employee.

858
00:53:22.711 --> 00:53:24.910
You must have already seen photos and rumors...

859
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:27.711
of me and VP Choi.

860
00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:32.651
I'd like to explain that, so please hear me out.

861
00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:38.261
While I worked as a contract worker,

862
00:53:38.261 --> 00:53:40.961
I was unable to meet my superiors.

863
00:53:41.591 --> 00:53:43.890
I was nothing but a part-timer.

864
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:47.801
I wasn't sure I would be hired full-time,

865
00:53:47.801 --> 00:53:49.430
so I didn't care.

866
00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.001
As I expected,

867
00:53:53.001 --> 00:53:55.040
my contract wasn't renewed after two years,

868
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.671
so I left the company.

869
00:53:57.211 --> 00:53:58.240
During that time,

870
00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:01.981
I worked at an event in Yangpyeong.

871
00:54:04.751 --> 00:54:05.821
That day,

872
00:54:05.821 --> 00:54:08.220
I spoke with only two other people.

873
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:11.160
The shopper is abroad for now,

874
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.961
and I tracked down the other person.

875
00:54:18.261 --> 00:54:20.160
Could you please tell them?

876
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:23.470
My name is Lee Kyung Ran...

877
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:25.071
and I work at Jeremy Hotel.

878
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.100
Last August,

879
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.470
my catering team was hired...

880
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:31.211
to work for an event at a villa in Yangpyeong.

881
00:54:31.611 --> 00:54:34.751
She was there to work part-time.

882
00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:36.310
She said she was hungry,

883
00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:39.450
so I gave her a cereal bar as a snack.

884
00:54:44.321 --> 00:54:47.290
This photo of me and VP Choi was taken...

885
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:49.790
while we were discussing my payment.

886
00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.901
VP Choi hired me to read...

887
00:54:52.901 --> 00:54:54.571
the foreign language script...

888
00:54:54.571 --> 00:54:56.071
at that trunk show.

889
00:54:56.071 --> 00:54:59.600
Does that mean you knew VP Choi before?

890
00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.240
Yes.

891
00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.211
Due to my careless speeding on the road,

892
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.810
I caused his car damage.

893
00:55:10.111 --> 00:55:12.620
I owed him a repair fee of 20,700 dollars,

894
00:55:12.781 --> 00:55:14.350
but he waived it.

895
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:18.490
What's going on?

896
00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.691
Out of...

897
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:22.330
pity for my situation.

898
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:25.801
The car I was driving wasn't mine.

899
00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:28.700
It was my superior's car,

900
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:30.531
and I have caused an accident...

901
00:55:30.531 --> 00:55:32.801
while I was on an urgent errand.

902
00:55:34.671 --> 00:55:36.370
So that's what happened.

903
00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:43.011
When he heard I couldn't come up...

904
00:55:43.011 --> 00:55:44.551
with all that money,

905
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.151
VP Choi waived it under one condition.

906
00:55:47.551 --> 00:55:49.191
I had to work at the trunk show...

907
00:55:49.191 --> 00:55:51.160
for that one day.

908
00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.390
I lost my phone,

909
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:56.790
so I don't have the text messages,

910
00:55:57.361 --> 00:55:59.731
but VP Choi might still have them...

911
00:56:00.531 --> 00:56:02.870
Could you check to see if you still...

912
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:04.301
have those texts?

913
00:56:10.511 --> 00:56:12.881
(Assailant)

914
00:56:14.981 --> 00:56:17.821
Could you show it around?

915
00:56:17.981 --> 00:56:19.350
I'll have a look.

916
00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.131
"The event's over and they're cleaning up."

917
00:56:34.131 --> 00:56:35.301
"Where are you?"

918
00:56:35.301 --> 00:56:37.231
"I'm all alone."

919
00:56:37.231 --> 00:56:38.401
"You should tell me..."

920
00:56:38.401 --> 00:56:40.171
"whether to go or stay."

921
00:56:40.401 --> 00:56:42.341
"Why aren't you picking up?"

922
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:44.071
"I spent all my cash to get here."

923
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:45.481
"I can't afford a taxi back."

924
00:56:45.711 --> 00:56:47.481
"You're a third-generation conglomerate?"

925
00:56:47.481 --> 00:56:48.881
"Good for you."

926
00:56:48.881 --> 00:56:50.981
"Very well. I don't want to have..."

927
00:56:50.981 --> 00:56:52.580
"any more to do with you."

928
00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.151
"I'll wait until you get here."

929
00:56:54.151 --> 00:56:55.990
"Even if that means waiting all night."

930
00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:58.220
I apologize.

931
00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.790
I didn't know who he was at that time...

932
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:03.290
and I was very rude.

933
00:57:05.631 --> 00:57:06.801
Keep reading.

934
00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.171
Thanks.

935
00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:12.801
This is what VP Choi sent to her.

936
00:57:12.801 --> 00:57:13.870
I'll read it.

937
00:57:15.171 --> 00:57:17.040
"I'll text because I can't reach you."

938
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.410
"I apologize. Something urgent came up."

939
00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:20.810
"Call me when you can."

940
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.651
"I'll settle the bill properly."

941
00:57:23.781 --> 00:57:25.120
Because of something urgent,

942
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.481
he left before he could pay me,

943
00:57:27.691 --> 00:57:30.191
and I'd gotten the wrong idea.

944
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.321
"Text me the balance..."

945
00:57:33.321 --> 00:57:34.390
"and your bank details."

946
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:35.861
"I'll wire you the rest."

947
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.531
Were those from Seo Ji An?

948
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.870
No. The number is saved as "Assailant".

949
00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:43.901
- "Assailant"? - "Assailant"?

950
00:57:43.901 --> 00:57:45.200
"Assailant"?

951
00:57:45.301 --> 00:57:46.770
Like I just said,

952
00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:48.711
I'd lost my phone.

953
00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.281
To prove that was my old number,

954
00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.080
I got the phone company...

955
00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.511
to print out proof of my old contract.

956
00:58:02.691 --> 00:58:04.720
The number's the same.

957
00:58:09.031 --> 00:58:11.461
I returned to the Marketing Team...

958
00:58:11.461 --> 00:58:14.100
and met VP Choi again.

959
00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.700
I'm currently in charge of planning and organizing...

960
00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.841
Haesung Apparel's 40th anniversary event,

961
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.441
and the event will appear in the next PR video.

962
00:58:23.441 --> 00:58:26.640
We went to research retro backdrops.

963
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:29.111
Here is what we have worked on.

964
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:38.321
What a surprise.

965
00:58:38.861 --> 00:58:40.691
What a coincidence.

966
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:42.261
You're right.

967
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:49.131
VP Choi was quite generous, right?

968
00:58:50.571 --> 00:58:52.341
- He is. - Good for him.

969
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:58.140
- Well done. - You must be tired.

970
00:58:58.441 --> 00:59:00.341
I wish you well. Bye.

971
00:59:12.691 --> 00:59:13.761
Dad.

972
00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.691
How could something be so dramatic?

973
00:59:17.731 --> 00:59:20.961
Why didn't you say you already knew her?

974
00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:24.071
Later.

975
00:59:27.571 --> 00:59:29.011
The meeting's over.

976
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:31.941
You two can leave now.

977
00:59:41.151 --> 00:59:43.850
Why do you think? He was embarrassed.

978
00:59:46.321 --> 00:59:47.461
I apologize.

979
00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:49.430
Poor Eun Seok.

980
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:51.600
Why is she trying so hard?

981
00:59:52.531 --> 00:59:54.370
We could've come clean today.

982
00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:57.430
She's special.

983
00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:01.841
She's our blood, and she wants my plan to succeed.

984
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:06.240
See? Things just got so much more dramatic.

985
01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:17.651
Here's the summary...

986
01:00:17.651 --> 01:00:19.591
of the director's meeting held today.

987
01:00:20.461 --> 01:00:22.990
She owed 20,700 dollars for repairs,

988
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:24.631
and he waived that?

989
01:00:24.631 --> 01:00:26.930
"It was my superior's car,"

990
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:28.501
"and I have caused an accident..."

991
01:00:28.501 --> 01:00:30.870
"while I was on an urgent errand."

992
01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:33.841
Everyone's raving about how cool our VP is.

993
01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:38.011
"A third-generation heir into noblesse oblige."

994
01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.580
Did you get a new car?

995
01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:44.821
No, it's my boss'. I'm running an errand.

996
01:00:47.381 --> 01:00:50.120
It looks like you're in real trouble.

997
01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:56.461
Ms. Seo.

998
01:00:57.131 --> 01:01:00.261
You worked so hard because you owed our VP.

999
01:01:00.861 --> 01:01:01.970
Ms. Seo.

1000
01:01:02.401 --> 01:01:04.901
You bumped into our VP's car?

1001
01:01:06.941 --> 01:01:08.841
Then why didn't you tell me so?

1002
01:01:09.011 --> 01:01:10.341
They didn't know each other then.

1003
01:01:10.611 --> 01:01:13.381
Mr. Choi had her saved as "Assailant".

1004
01:01:14.751 --> 01:01:18.921
Okay, so everything makes sense now,

1005
01:01:20.321 --> 01:01:22.390
but did you have to tell them...

1006
01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.251
that it was your superior's car?

1007
01:01:25.091 --> 01:01:27.890
I tried my best to keep that out,

1008
01:01:28.631 --> 01:01:29.930
but I had no choice.

1009
01:01:36.001 --> 01:01:37.200
Hello.

1010
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.711
Ms. Seo.

1011
01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.410
Thank you.

1012
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.220
I apologize, sir.

1013
01:01:59.921 --> 01:02:01.290
There's no need for that.

1014
01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:04.660
A team dinner is overdue. Let's go out tonight.

1015
01:02:05.031 --> 01:02:06.700
I will treat you all.

1016
01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.330
I need to thank Ms. Seo too.

1017
01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:13.001
I have to stay late as there's a lot to do.

1018
01:02:13.501 --> 01:02:14.611
Ji An.

1019
01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:17.071
It's fine.

1020
01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:19.611
I can't force you.

1021
01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.410
It could cause another misunderstanding.

1022
01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.251
Let's go without her.

1023
01:02:26.551 --> 01:02:27.890
I'll make it up to you later.

1024
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:39.501
Ha Jung, you must work with me.

1025
01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.031
I'll do it tomorrow.

1026
01:03:02.055 --> 01:03:07.055
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1027
01:03:42.761 --> 01:03:45.001
Why do I like you so much?

1028
01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:49.501
You suit me just fine.

1029
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:56.011
There's no escaping me.

1030
01:03:58.740 --> 01:03:59.941
Did I scare you? Here.

1031
01:04:01.511 --> 01:04:03.051
But I'm your brother...

1032
01:04:05.881 --> 01:04:08.720
What are you doing here?

1033
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:11.620
How could I treat my staff without my sister?

1034
01:04:12.361 --> 01:04:13.961
Why didn't you answer your phone?

1035
01:04:15.091 --> 01:04:17.091
I keep it on silent mode when I work.

1036
01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:20.330
But why are you here?

1037
01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.970
What?

1038
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:26.171
Think about what you did today.

1039
01:04:28.571 --> 01:04:31.140
You sweet thing, you saved my family.

1040
01:04:33.611 --> 01:04:36.180
- Eun Seok. - No.

1041
01:04:40.551 --> 01:04:42.620
- What? - I'm...

1042
01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:46.620
not Eun Seok.

1043
01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:52.761
Are you drunk after just one can?

1044
01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.301
I am...

1045
01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:02.711
not your sister.

1046
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:06.841
I'm Seo Ji An.

1047
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:09.551
What?

1048
01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.580
The real Eun Seok...

1049
01:05:16.191 --> 01:05:18.020
is Ji Soo, my twin sister.

1050
01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:23.691
What...

1051
01:05:25.901 --> 01:05:27.600
What did you just say?

1052
01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:33.040
I am...

1053
01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:36.011
not Choi Eun Seok.

1054
01:05:37.211 --> 01:05:38.640
I am Seo Ji An.

1055
01:05:40.281 --> 01:05:41.580
The real Choi Eun Seok...

1056
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:44.850
is my twin sister,

1057
01:05:45.781 --> 01:05:46.950
Seo Ji Soo.

1058
01:05:48.921 --> 01:05:50.020
Ji Soo...

1059
01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:52.321
is the real Eun Seok.
