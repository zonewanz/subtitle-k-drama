00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:11.231
(Episode 21)

2
00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:14.131
I wanted to see you because...

3
00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.701
I'd like to...

4
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:25.901
ask you for a favor without letting Eun Jae know.

5
00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.041
Since you saved my life,

6
00:00:48.812 --> 00:00:50.441
could you...

7
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:53.072
help me out a bit more?

8
00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:55.841
What do you mean?

9
00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:09.712
Your father is much better now.

10
00:01:11.212 --> 00:01:12.541
Thank you.

11
00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:17.072
I subscribed to...

12
00:01:17.072 --> 00:01:19.511
a cancer insurance plan a month ago.

13
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.141
If I'm diagnosed with cancer...

14
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:26.341
90 days after the subscription,

15
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:28.712
I get paid 15,000 dollars.

16
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:30.171
I have 10 plans.

17
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:33.972
Until then, there can't be any...

18
00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.772
records of diagnosis.

19
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:39.212
I don't understand what you mean.

20
00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:45.742
The fact that...

21
00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.572
I was diagnosed with cancer today...

22
00:01:49.572 --> 00:01:51.811
must be deleted.

23
00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:53.811
Are you...

24
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.072
asking me to...

25
00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:00.871
He's asking you to alter his chart.

26
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:05.841
Stay outside.

27
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:08.811
Come out.

28
00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:11.371
Don't listen to his nonsense.

29
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:14.772
- Come out now. - I'm just being smart.

30
00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:24.411
When will you grow up?

31
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:26.042
What?

32
00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:28.672
You're over 30 years old.

33
00:02:28.672 --> 00:02:31.212
You should be more flexible.

34
00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:34.371
Aren't I right, doctor?

35
00:02:35.112 --> 00:02:38.471
Did I ask for too much?

36
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:43.142
I just asked you to delete my records in secret.

37
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.941
Whom will that harm? No one.

38
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:48.712
But I'll end up with 150,000 dollars...

39
00:02:48.712 --> 00:02:49.941
Enough.

40
00:02:53.242 --> 00:02:55.471
Wasn't it enough to con people?

41
00:02:57.242 --> 00:02:59.411
You put up all we had...

42
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:01.341
and me as collateral.

43
00:03:01.772 --> 00:03:04.742
Now, you want to defraud insurance companies with your life?

44
00:03:04.742 --> 00:03:06.012
Woo Jae.

45
00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:11.941
I invested all his tuition to get this opportunity.

46
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:15.642
Don't try to ruin things.

47
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:20.672
- Keep quiet. - In your dreams.

48
00:03:20.672 --> 00:03:23.612
- This is my last chance. - There might not be another one.

49
00:03:23.612 --> 00:03:26.142
- I don't care! - Don't you know...

50
00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:29.242
what I mean?

51
00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:35.742
Do you?

52
00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:47.311
I know.

53
00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:51.142
Just do it.

54
00:03:53.242 --> 00:03:54.811
I don't care.

55
00:04:09.871 --> 00:04:11.042
Eun Jae.

56
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:13.311
What was all that?

57
00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.142
What was Dad talking about?

58
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:30.011
Dad. Are you crazy?

59
00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:35.641
- Sit next to me. - Are you crazy?

60
00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.871
Stop crying,

61
00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:39.842
and sit down.

62
00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:43.071
You'll be the man of the family once I'm gone.

63
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:45.672
How will you be able...

64
00:04:46.412 --> 00:04:48.511
to look after your sister if you're so weak?

65
00:05:32.612 --> 00:05:34.042
I...

66
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:37.612
Stop it.

67
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:42.912
Don't try so hard.

68
00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:46.071
Let your anger out.

69
00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:48.711
Shout if you want to.

70
00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:51.211
If you want to cry,

71
00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:53.941
then cry to your heart's content.

72
00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:56.211
Why?

73
00:05:57.211 --> 00:06:00.811
Why should I do that? What for?

74
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:04.711
Why must I keep showing my worst to you?

75
00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:06.112
Because you're human.

76
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.011
Because you are...

77
00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:13.342
a human being, not a machine.

78
00:06:24.972 --> 00:06:26.542
Let me share it.

79
00:06:29.172 --> 00:06:30.771
Not all the time.

80
00:06:33.742 --> 00:06:36.511
Just when you're struggling like this.

81
00:06:41.412 --> 00:06:42.542
No.

82
00:06:45.412 --> 00:06:46.641
I don't need you.

83
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:50.311
Don't get involved with my family anymore.

84
00:06:51.172 --> 00:06:53.211
Even if my brother calls you...

85
00:06:54.571 --> 00:06:57.112
Even if my dad's dying or...

86
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:00.441
even if I'm dying,

87
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:04.172
don't ever...

88
00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:08.711
get involved.

89
00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:00.771
Persuade her at all costs.

90
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.242
Get her to delete my records.

91
00:08:03.242 --> 00:08:05.511
- You can't do that. - Do it anyway.

92
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:07.141
You'll die.

93
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:09.711
I'll probably die even after the surgery.

94
00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:12.912
I asked around enough to know.

95
00:08:13.441 --> 00:08:15.071
Even if I'm operated on,

96
00:08:15.571 --> 00:08:17.941
I have less than 20-percent chance of living.

97
00:08:18.342 --> 00:08:20.811
8 out of 10 die.

98
00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:24.511
No one can promise that I won't be...

99
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:27.612
1 of those 8.

100
00:08:27.612 --> 00:08:30.612
You have Eun Jae. She will do something.

101
00:08:30.612 --> 00:08:31.972
Your sister did...

102
00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:34.841
more than enough.

103
00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:38.042
Because of me...

104
00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:43.772
She's been running all over the place,

105
00:08:44.372 --> 00:08:46.441
trying to clean up my mess.

106
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:48.571
She has been for years.

107
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:52.341
Dad, she's almost done paying off the bank.

108
00:08:56.811 --> 00:08:58.811
I borrowed from loan sharks too.

109
00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:00.311
What?

110
00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:05.471
I wanted to make a comeback, pay off my debts,

111
00:09:06.142 --> 00:09:08.772
and pay your sister back several times over.

112
00:09:09.672 --> 00:09:11.611
I was so unlucky,

113
00:09:12.912 --> 00:09:14.471
and my debt snowballed.

114
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.611
Listen to me carefully, Woo Jae.

115
00:09:21.412 --> 00:09:23.872
I'm useless and a loser,

116
00:09:23.872 --> 00:09:26.912
but I'm still your dad.

117
00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:30.611
I may not be able to leave you an inheritance,

118
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:34.542
but I don't want to leave you burdened with debt.

119
00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:37.971
Let me do that.

120
00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:40.741
Will you?

121
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:42.811
Woo Jae.

122
00:09:47.142 --> 00:09:48.672
He fell from a height.

123
00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:50.172
Do you know where you are?

124
00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:53.142
- The OR called for you. - Song Eun Jae speaking.

125
00:09:53.142 --> 00:09:55.042
Yes. Okay, I got it.

126
00:09:55.042 --> 00:09:58.071
A child came in with a stomach ache and a fever of 39.5°C.

127
00:09:58.071 --> 00:10:00.512
- When was this? - A traffic accident victim.

128
00:10:00.512 --> 00:10:03.412
Can you feel me touching you?

129
00:10:03.512 --> 00:10:06.542
One of your patients' vitals are unstable. Go check.

130
00:10:06.542 --> 00:10:07.642
Okay.

131
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:12.912
Hello.

132
00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:16.672
(Emergency Medical Center)

133
00:10:59.211 --> 00:11:00.912
(Choi Young Eun)

134
00:11:03.912 --> 00:11:06.272
- Where are you? - I'm back.

135
00:11:06.611 --> 00:11:08.971
- What? - I rented an atelier nearby.

136
00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:10.912
I'll stay here for a while.

137
00:11:11.412 --> 00:11:12.841
What about chemotherapy?

138
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:16.841
I don't want it. I won't go through it.

139
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:19.571
What's wrong with you?

140
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:22.912
It will make me look ugly and lose my hair.

141
00:11:23.012 --> 00:11:26.042
- Young Eun. - I won't be cured.

142
00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:29.142
It's only to buy time.

143
00:11:30.772 --> 00:11:33.471
If you buy more time, you may find a donor.

144
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:35.642
It's not certain.

145
00:11:36.142 --> 00:11:38.142
I don't want to depend on false hope...

146
00:11:38.142 --> 00:11:40.142
and live in a pathetic way.

147
00:11:40.142 --> 00:11:44.111
I don't have much to look forward to in life anyway.

148
00:11:47.512 --> 00:11:48.611
Hello?

149
00:11:53.971 --> 00:11:56.611
The phone is turned off.

150
00:12:16.142 --> 00:12:17.672
Who is it?

151
00:12:27.241 --> 00:12:30.372
- What brings you here? - Let's talk.

152
00:12:31.412 --> 00:12:33.912
Put a jacket on. It's quite cold.

153
00:12:51.412 --> 00:12:53.872
I'm quite pathetic.

154
00:12:55.172 --> 00:12:58.512
You came all the way here immediately.

155
00:12:58.512 --> 00:13:01.611
I know that it's neither because you missed me...

156
00:13:02.071 --> 00:13:04.012
nor like me.

157
00:13:05.611 --> 00:13:08.872
It makes me happy even though I know all that.

158
00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:12.272
The fact that...

159
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:16.912
you came is enough to make me happy.

160
00:13:17.372 --> 00:13:18.642
Get treatment.

161
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:23.412
I have no intention.

162
00:13:23.412 --> 00:13:25.211
Why are you so unruly?

163
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:26.471
There's no point.

164
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:29.012
Don't you consider those who'd be sad to lose you?

165
00:13:31.412 --> 00:13:34.372
Does it hurt you?

166
00:13:35.971 --> 00:13:37.711
If I die,

167
00:13:38.772 --> 00:13:41.741
will it hurt you too?

168
00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:46.971
If you stay with me...

169
00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:52.512
Without loving someone else,

170
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:55.012
if you promise...

171
00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:57.941
to stay only by my side,

172
00:13:59.571 --> 00:14:01.241
I'll get treatment.

173
00:14:04.012 --> 00:14:05.241
You don't want that?

174
00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:44.172
- Are you finished? - Almost.

175
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:46.741
You didn't get any sleep because of work.

176
00:14:46.971 --> 00:14:48.241
What about yourself?

177
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:51.672
Shall we go eat something?

178
00:14:52.512 --> 00:14:54.611
It'll be my treat.

179
00:15:08.971 --> 00:15:10.042
Eat.

180
00:15:20.172 --> 00:15:21.772
Let's alter the chart.

181
00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:27.772
After altering it, release Dad from the hospital.

182
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:30.971
Let him go his way.

183
00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:35.741
We've done well without him so far.

184
00:15:37.142 --> 00:15:38.172
Actually,

185
00:15:39.912 --> 00:15:42.211
it was as if he were dead.

186
00:15:42.211 --> 00:15:43.341
Woo Jae.

187
00:15:43.841 --> 00:15:45.642
He wants to protect you.

188
00:15:47.542 --> 00:15:49.772
Let him act like a father for the last time.

189
00:15:50.872 --> 00:15:52.811
He wants to pay off his debt.

190
00:15:53.412 --> 00:15:55.872
He has nothing to give you as an inheritance.

191
00:15:58.272 --> 00:16:01.142
He can't leave you with debt.

192
00:16:08.466 --> 00:16:11.698
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 21 Hospital Ship "Bile Duct Cancer"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

193
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:20.142
I'm sorry, Eun Jae.

194
00:16:24.071 --> 00:16:27.772
I know what you think of him.

195
00:16:31.012 --> 00:16:33.512
I can't help but feel sorry for him.

196
00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:38.512
I feel unbearably sorry for him.

197
00:16:40.211 --> 00:16:41.971
I'm sorry, Eun Jae.

198
00:17:05.612 --> 00:17:06.672
Hello, doctor.

199
00:17:06.672 --> 00:17:08.971
I reviewed the diagnosis that you sent me.

200
00:17:09.412 --> 00:17:11.211
It won't be easy.

201
00:17:12.172 --> 00:17:15.372
It's not bad enough to make surgery impossible.

202
00:17:15.842 --> 00:17:18.041
There's a chance of survival indeed.

203
00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:20.912
However, the surgery can't be done by any doctor.

204
00:17:21.211 --> 00:17:23.011
It won't be possible unless you're top three...

205
00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:24.741
specializing in the biliary system.

206
00:17:25.112 --> 00:17:27.142
They're Kim Young Gyu and Lee Seung Yoon.

207
00:17:27.471 --> 00:17:29.412
Do you know the third person?

208
00:17:30.971 --> 00:17:32.241
Yes, I do.

209
00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:36.011
If it were simpler, I'd do it.

210
00:17:36.842 --> 00:17:38.511
I'm sorry, Eun Jae.

211
00:17:38.642 --> 00:17:40.842
My father survived because of you.

212
00:17:40.842 --> 00:17:43.041
I'm so sorry that I can't help you.

213
00:17:43.211 --> 00:17:45.711
No, you've been of big help.

214
00:17:46.572 --> 00:17:49.471
Okay, thank you for saying that.

215
00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:08.112
Why are you at work so early?

216
00:18:08.112 --> 00:18:11.711
Your father is in the ER.

217
00:18:11.711 --> 00:18:14.312
Would you be happy if the director is still in bed?

218
00:18:14.912 --> 00:18:17.842
Why are you bringing that up?

219
00:18:17.842 --> 00:18:19.572
What is Dr. Song doing?

220
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:21.572
I told her to be with her father,

221
00:18:21.572 --> 00:18:23.412
but she doesn't listen.

222
00:18:23.612 --> 00:18:26.072
She's been working and on call all night.

223
00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:27.812
How can you call yourself her boss?

224
00:18:27.971 --> 00:18:30.271
Can't you manage better?

225
00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:31.511
Pardon me?

226
00:18:39.342 --> 00:18:41.112
Hello, Dr. Song.

227
00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:43.771
How is your father?

228
00:18:44.142 --> 00:18:47.011
I was about to pay him a visit.

229
00:18:47.471 --> 00:18:49.312
I have something to tell you.

230
00:18:49.312 --> 00:18:51.312
- Now? - Yes.

231
00:18:51.471 --> 00:18:52.612
Okay.

232
00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:04.072
- Open the operating room? - Yes.

233
00:19:04.172 --> 00:19:05.612
Who will do the operation?

234
00:19:06.642 --> 00:19:08.011
I will.

235
00:19:09.672 --> 00:19:12.342
What are you talking about?

236
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:15.041
No doctor operates on their own family.

237
00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:17.072
I know that it's not illegal.

238
00:19:17.271 --> 00:19:18.842
It's not a simple operation.

239
00:19:18.842 --> 00:19:20.912
It's a surgery to remove bile duct cancers.

240
00:19:21.372 --> 00:19:23.412
Shouldn't you know better...

241
00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:26.041
how difficult this operation is?

242
00:19:26.812 --> 00:19:27.812
I know.

243
00:19:27.812 --> 00:19:30.511
Then how could you volunteer to do it?

244
00:19:31.572 --> 00:19:34.271
Don't argue with me. Just find another doctor.

245
00:19:34.271 --> 00:19:36.441
I made the decision after a thorough research.

246
00:19:37.672 --> 00:19:39.741
The cancer has advanced, and the location...

247
00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:42.172
of the cancer is tricky.

248
00:19:42.172 --> 00:19:43.941
Regardless of the doctor's experience,

249
00:19:43.941 --> 00:19:45.511
the success rate is less than 30 percent.

250
00:19:45.511 --> 00:19:48.672
Right, and you're still willing to do it yourself?

251
00:19:49.011 --> 00:19:50.072
Yes.

252
00:19:52.142 --> 00:19:55.172
What's the reason? Let me hear it.

253
00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.711
No doctor is willing to do it.

254
00:19:57.711 --> 00:19:59.441
Unless it's 1 of the top 3 doctors,

255
00:19:59.441 --> 00:20:01.872
this surgery won't be successful.

256
00:20:01.872 --> 00:20:03.941
What kind of arrogance is this?

257
00:20:04.172 --> 00:20:07.172
Are you saying that you're the best doctor?

258
00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:09.672
The top three doctors can't do the operation.

259
00:20:10.672 --> 00:20:12.441
That's why I'll do it.

260
00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:14.612
I must...

261
00:20:16.412 --> 00:20:17.771
save my father.

262
00:20:22.941 --> 00:20:25.342
- Who are they? - Pardon me?

263
00:20:25.541 --> 00:20:28.271
Who are the top three doctors?

264
00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:30.342
Doctor Kim Young Gyu at Sewoon Hospital...

265
00:20:30.342 --> 00:20:32.142
is on vacation abroad.

266
00:20:32.572 --> 00:20:34.711
Doctor Lee Seung Yoon at Gyeongsang Hospital...

267
00:20:34.711 --> 00:20:36.572
was diagnosed with liver cancer.

268
00:20:36.572 --> 00:20:38.041
He's hospitalized.

269
00:20:39.011 --> 00:20:40.112
And...

270
00:20:42.011 --> 00:20:43.541
Why did you stop speaking?

271
00:20:44.612 --> 00:20:46.241
Who is the last one?

272
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:49.541
Who is it?

273
00:20:51.142 --> 00:20:52.771
It's Professor Kim Do Hoon...

274
00:20:53.572 --> 00:20:55.642
at Seoul Daehan Hospital.

275
00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:00.971
And?

276
00:21:01.342 --> 00:21:03.241
He won't do the surgery.

277
00:21:03.241 --> 00:21:05.011
How do you know that?

278
00:21:05.011 --> 00:21:08.372
I think you already know the reason why.

279
00:21:08.372 --> 00:21:10.271
What do you mean?

280
00:21:11.412 --> 00:21:13.172
- Go with it. - Sir.

281
00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:14.741
Go to him right now.

282
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:16.812
Kneel in front of him if you need to.

283
00:21:16.812 --> 00:21:19.872
Kneel, and beg him to save your father's life.

284
00:21:20.511 --> 00:21:21.842
I can't.

285
00:21:21.842 --> 00:21:24.271
Why? Is it because of your pride?

286
00:21:24.842 --> 00:21:27.741
Is your pride more important than your father's life?

287
00:21:27.741 --> 00:21:29.172
I need to go.

288
00:21:51.912 --> 00:21:53.741
(Seoul Daehan Hospital)

289
00:21:56.572 --> 00:21:58.372
Gosh, look at them.

290
00:21:58.741 --> 00:22:01.312
Hey, go sleep in your beds.

291
00:22:01.412 --> 00:22:04.011
- Hello, sir. - Did you finish just now?

292
00:22:04.112 --> 00:22:06.471
- Do you have anything to eat? - I'll get something.

293
00:22:06.471 --> 00:22:09.511
Never mind. I'll just have this.

294
00:22:09.612 --> 00:22:11.612
- No, I'll get... - It's all right.

295
00:22:11.612 --> 00:22:13.372
I need sleep more than food.

296
00:22:13.771 --> 00:22:16.172
I'll just have this and get some sleep.

297
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:18.872
Yes? Really?

298
00:22:19.812 --> 00:22:22.142
It's Jinju Prison. They have a donor.

299
00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:25.412
Se Joon. Take Jae Hwan, and bring the organ.

300
00:22:25.412 --> 00:22:27.511
Call patient Ahn Se Ho, and get him ready for surgery.

301
00:22:27.511 --> 00:22:28.672
All right.

302
00:22:31.741 --> 00:22:32.971
Hello?

303
00:22:34.771 --> 00:22:36.872
No, I have a minute.

304
00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:40.471
Doctor Song's father?

305
00:22:41.342 --> 00:22:44.312
Did he just say Doctor Song's father?

306
00:22:44.412 --> 00:22:46.041
Do you think something bad happened?

307
00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:49.711
Doctor Kim, why aren't you coming?

308
00:22:53.112 --> 00:22:54.771
Bile duct cancer? I feel sorry for her.

309
00:22:54.771 --> 00:22:56.912
I will send you the test results.

310
00:22:56.912 --> 00:22:59.412
- No, you don't need to. - Kim Do Hoon.

311
00:22:59.412 --> 00:23:02.642
She doesn't seem to be worried. Why are you doing this for her?

312
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:05.142
Of course, she is worried.

313
00:23:05.142 --> 00:23:07.312
If she was, she'd have called me first.

314
00:23:07.312 --> 00:23:08.842
She wants to, but she can't.

315
00:23:08.842 --> 00:23:10.441
Why is that?

316
00:23:10.672 --> 00:23:12.971
You know why.

317
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:15.112
I only know...

318
00:23:15.112 --> 00:23:18.612
that Eun Jae told me that you are the only doctor who can...

319
00:23:18.612 --> 00:23:20.842
conduct such complex surgery in Korea.

320
00:23:21.271 --> 00:23:24.812
Did she really tell you that?

321
00:23:24.812 --> 00:23:25.971
Yes.

322
00:23:26.372 --> 00:23:29.941
Are you still going to refuse the test results?

323
00:23:53.471 --> 00:23:56.211
Give it to me. It looks heavy.

324
00:24:00.312 --> 00:24:03.312
- What do you mean? - I talked with Doctor Ko.

325
00:24:03.541 --> 00:24:04.741
I'm going to make an appointment for your surgery...

326
00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:08.372
- after the holidays. - What do you mean?

327
00:24:08.941 --> 00:24:13.011
Does this mean that you're going to focus on me?

328
00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:16.912
There is...

329
00:24:18.912 --> 00:24:20.041
no one else.

330
00:24:20.312 --> 00:24:21.541
Are you going to...

331
00:24:22.471 --> 00:24:24.241
stay next to me?

332
00:24:28.142 --> 00:24:29.312
Hyun.

333
00:24:29.312 --> 00:24:32.541
But not as your boyfriend. That's impossible.

334
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:34.872
I'm just...

335
00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:38.112
going to stay next to you as a doctor.

336
00:24:38.112 --> 00:24:39.541
That doesn't matter.

337
00:24:40.142 --> 00:24:42.041
As long as you are next to me,

338
00:24:42.041 --> 00:24:43.672
I don't care if you're there...

339
00:24:44.312 --> 00:24:46.612
as my boyfriend or doctor.

340
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:58.812
Why are there so many people even though it's not the weekend?

341
00:24:59.612 --> 00:25:02.642
You must have been distracted recently.

342
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:05.441
Maybe you're in love.

343
00:25:05.441 --> 00:25:08.441
- Really? - Don't talk nonsense.

344
00:25:08.441 --> 00:25:10.612
Then why don't you know what day it is?

345
00:25:10.812 --> 00:25:12.441
It's Chuseok.

346
00:25:12.441 --> 00:25:14.241
- Sir. - Hello.

347
00:25:15.011 --> 00:25:16.241
Hello.

348
00:25:16.471 --> 00:25:19.241
They came all the way here to check these cars?

349
00:25:19.241 --> 00:25:21.211
I know, right?

350
00:25:21.211 --> 00:25:24.372
The fan belt is worn down. I think you should change it.

351
00:25:24.672 --> 00:25:26.412
What would happen if I don't?

352
00:25:26.412 --> 00:25:28.312
The car could stop suddenly.

353
00:25:28.312 --> 00:25:30.642
You could have had to push your car all the way home.

354
00:25:30.642 --> 00:25:32.312
I know.

355
00:25:32.312 --> 00:25:35.612
It's nice that I got my car checked before something like that happened.

356
00:25:36.372 --> 00:25:40.072
They must be visiting their ancestors' graves.

357
00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:42.511
Now, you get it.

358
00:25:42.511 --> 00:25:45.642
Gosh, people are still very kind.

359
00:25:45.642 --> 00:25:49.172
They still visit the graves to look after them.

360
00:25:49.172 --> 00:25:51.412
Yes, it's nice.

361
00:25:51.741 --> 00:25:53.941
- They're still kind at heart. - That's right.

362
00:25:55.912 --> 00:25:58.172
This is the last one.

363
00:25:58.172 --> 00:26:00.372
- Here. - Okay.

364
00:26:08.142 --> 00:26:09.812
Why are you so upset this morning?

365
00:26:09.812 --> 00:26:12.172
I think Young Eun and Hyun...

366
00:26:12.172 --> 00:26:13.711
are going out again.

367
00:26:14.771 --> 00:26:17.812
- What? Why? - I don't know.

368
00:26:17.812 --> 00:26:21.741
I saw them in the parking lot, and they looked like a couple.

369
00:26:21.741 --> 00:26:24.812
- Really? - Yes.

370
00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:48.511
- Are you sick? - No.

371
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:50.572
Or is something troubling you?

372
00:26:50.842 --> 00:26:52.471
I have a headache.

373
00:26:54.771 --> 00:26:56.612
I think I'll rest for an hour.

374
00:26:56.771 --> 00:26:58.312
Take two.

375
00:26:58.312 --> 00:27:01.072
There won't be any patients before then.

376
00:27:30.041 --> 00:27:31.312
What?

377
00:27:31.612 --> 00:27:32.711
It's so hot.

378
00:27:32.711 --> 00:27:35.172
Let me put the noodles in.

379
00:27:36.912 --> 00:27:40.041
Young Eun, you should eat with us.

380
00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:42.172
I'm fine. You should eat.

381
00:27:45.412 --> 00:27:48.711
Thanks to her, we can eat more.

382
00:27:48.711 --> 00:27:50.842
She's very considerate.

383
00:27:50.842 --> 00:27:52.872
Here, let's put this in.

384
00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:57.011
- Yes, Jeong Rim? - Are you out of your mind?

385
00:27:57.011 --> 00:27:59.372
When are you going to stop?

386
00:28:04.072 --> 00:28:05.872
Well, Jeong Rim,

387
00:28:06.072 --> 00:28:09.011
I'll call you later when I'm somewhere quiet.

388
00:28:09.471 --> 00:28:10.511
Bye.

389
00:28:23.572 --> 00:28:24.711
Jeong Rim.

390
00:28:26.741 --> 00:28:29.971
What? He called you again?

391
00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:32.342
When are you going to stop lying to him?

392
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:47.011
- So Hyun doesn't know yet? - Not yet.

393
00:28:47.672 --> 00:28:50.041
I can't lie to him forever.

394
00:28:52.172 --> 00:28:55.441
But I just need to get him to like me first.

395
00:28:55.872 --> 00:28:58.471
I just need to make sure he doesn't run away from me...

396
00:28:59.572 --> 00:29:01.872
before he finds out I don't have leukemia.

397
00:29:25.127 --> 00:29:27.427
(Episode 22 will air shortly.)
