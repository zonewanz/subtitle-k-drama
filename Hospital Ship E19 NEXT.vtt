1
00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:11.960
A building collapsed at a demolition site...

2
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.761
in Daeyeon-dong, Busan today.

3
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:15.930
Here's a list of the injured.

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.230
Park Yong Jae, a 35-year-old welder.

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.230
Oh Hee Jung, a 42-year-old labor worker.

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.300
Song Woo Jae, a 28-year-old student.

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.241
Jang Seok Nam, a 45-year-old laborer.

8
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:30.750
Let the patient through!

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.251
- Oh no... - Honey!

10
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:35.120
- Honey! - Help me!

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.920
We have an ER patient.

12
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.351
- We have another patient. - Please make way.

13
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.761
I got a call. I'm looking for Song Woo Jae.

14
00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:48.531
Are you his guardian? Ask someone over there.

15
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.770
(Woo Jae)

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.971
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

17
00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:59.870
(Woo Jae)

18
00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:03.340
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

19
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.911
Please hurry, sir.

20
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:07.450
Please hurry.

21
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.461
Didn't you eat?

22
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.631
Not since morning.

23
00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:19.931
Eat up quick.

24
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.761
They're looking for you.

25
00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:24.101
The milk.

26
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:34.941
I thought I was going to die.

27
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:41.950
How do you know my sister?

28
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.191
I told you. We work together.

29
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.890
You like her, don't you?

30
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.860
Sorry.

31
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.360
You must really do.

32
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.030
Are you crazy?

33
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.941
How can you like someone like her?

34
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:05.071
I wonder.

35
00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:14.950
I quite like you.

36
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.591
Thanks.

37
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.191
No need to be polite.

38
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.360
From now on, I'll call you...

39
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:23.490
my brother-in-law, Hyun.

40
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.031
Brother-in-law?

41
00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:26.830
Hyun.

42
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:31.200
- Yes? - Speak freely.

43
00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:33.941
Okay, then.

44
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:36.501
Do me a favor.

45
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.881
Don't tell Eun Jae about tonight.

46
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480
Why?

47
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.110
She'll get worried over nothing.

48
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.680
I wasn't hurt that badly.

49
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.821
You'll be mentioned on the news.

50
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:52.390
Eun Jae doesn't watch the news.

51
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:54.691
She cares about nothing but surgeries.

52
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:57.360
You like her, and you don't even know that?

53
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.941
(Emergency Center)

54
00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:17.411
Can you hear me?

55
00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.851
Are you okay? Are you okay?

56
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.851
Doctor, do something.

57
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.161
Doctor, do something.

58
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.200
Nurse.

59
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.770
Do something, please.

60
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.210
What happened?

61
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.691
- I think... - Did she see us?

62
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.131
Woo Jae, you should sit up.

63
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.101
I am not sitting up.

64
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.071
You should hide too.

65
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.671
Song Woo Jae.

66
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.780
What are you saying?

67
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:32.821
Stop right there.

68
00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:34.061
Would you if you were me?

69
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.390
What are you doing?

70
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:44.631
Do as she says.

71
00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:47.241
I thought we were friends.

72
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.400
You're no longer my brother-in-law.

73
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.040
Will you stop saying that? Come with me.

74
00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.850
What now?

75
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.290
Come here.

76
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:07.460
Sit.

77
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.861
Working part-time?

78
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.890
What about college? Why are you working?

79
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.131
To make money.

80
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.001
Do you think I went to play?

81
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:17.200
I send you an allowance.

82
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:18.770
You told me to do as I wish.

83
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.470
So why did you beg me for more money?

84
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.640
I wired you 300 dollars...

85
00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:29.941
Are you...

86
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:33.950
Look at me.

87
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.321
Look at me.

88
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.720
Is it? Is it Dad?

89
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:45.931
You met?

90
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.530
When? When did he come back?

91
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:53.600
Two months ago.

92
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.970
That long ago?

93
00:05:57.071 --> 00:05:58.941
Did he take all your money?

94
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.410
He didn't. I gave it to him.

95
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.450
Just your allowance?

96
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:06.650
Did you enroll this semester?

97
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.890
You didn't?

98
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.290
Did he take your tuition too?

99
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.960
No, Dad said...

100
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.231
he had something to take care of.

101
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:19.290
Do you believe that?

102
00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:22.330
- He has lied to us... - More than once.

103
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.001
I know he lied to us numerous times.

104
00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:26.171
And?

105
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:28.171
I wanted to fall for it.

106
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.970
He's still...

107
00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:33.881
our dad.

108
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:57.830
- What's that for? - You paid his bills.

109
00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:03.970
That should cover the return gas charge and some extra.

110
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.080
What I can't pay back in money,

111
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:12.950
the stress and time you wasted, I'll make up for it in another way.

112
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.020
No.

113
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.621
This is enough.

114
00:07:17.491 --> 00:07:19.650
If we were to go into such detail,

115
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.020
I owe you much more.

116
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.691
This is all I need.

117
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.600
- I'd like to drive you... - I'll take a taxi.

118
00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:33.801
Okay. Take care.

119
00:08:26.821 --> 00:08:28.191
Oh dear.

120
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.361
I told him to throw everything out.

121
00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:45.111
No, stop it.

122
00:08:45.211 --> 00:08:48.011
As if you can do this with one arm. Stay still.

123
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:53.451
The other side.

124
00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:23.680
Why are you alone?

125
00:09:24.011 --> 00:09:27.221
Dr. Song isn't back. I thought you'd be with her.

126
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:39.461
Pour me one.

127
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.780
Stay here tonight,

128
00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:57.910
and go to our aunt's tomorrow.

129
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:00.621
I don't,

130
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:03.680
but you get along with her.

131
00:10:09.491 --> 00:10:12.761
Why aren't you answering? Don't you want to?

132
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:16.201
You're like Mom.

133
00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:21.140
To see you like that reminds me of Mom.

134
00:10:23.871 --> 00:10:26.371
Once you try the porridge I made,

135
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.581
you'll regret saying that.

136
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.621
It seems like you're suffering.

137
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:46.190
Is it because of Doctor Song?

138
00:10:49.601 --> 00:10:52.331
I can understand. I mean...

139
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.471
It's okay to suffer.

140
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.570
Doctor Song is cool.

141
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.381
She's charming even from women's perspective.

142
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.320
She's beautiful, talented, and charismatic.

143
00:11:08.381 --> 00:11:11.351
More than anything, she's pure and honest.

144
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.290
For an amazing woman like her,

145
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:17.631
it's worthwhile to suffer.

146
00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:25.371
Guess what, Hyun.

147
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.140
You're as amazing as Doctor Song.

148
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.111
No, you're more amazing than her.

149
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:38.310
Doctor Song...

150
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.351
will find out soon.

151
00:11:45.251 --> 00:11:48.190
She might already know that.

152
00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:51.131
It hasn't been long since she lost her mom.

153
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.060
- She needs some time. - This isn't like you.

154
00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:59.101
If you have something to say, just say it.

155
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.800
I lost.

156
00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:10.381
I'm quite a qualified woman,

157
00:12:13.111 --> 00:12:15.550
but I can't compare to Doctor Song.

158
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.121
She's so amazing that I can't keep up with her.

159
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:23.890
More importantly...

160
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:28.800
Now,

161
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:31.670
you like...

162
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:34.241
Doctor Song.

163
00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:36.670
You like her more than me.

164
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.050
I grant you my permission.

165
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:49.881
You can love Dr. Song as much as you want,

166
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:55.420
but give me two years.

167
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.831
Can you wait for two years?

168
00:13:04.501 --> 00:13:05.871
Two years later,

169
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.241
- I'll leave. - Young Eun.

170
00:13:11.841 --> 00:13:13.170
When...

171
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:17.040
I've disappeared from this world.

172
00:13:18.981 --> 00:13:23.550
Then you can love Dr. Song as much as you want.

173
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.991
What do you mean?

174
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.520
What do you mean?

175
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:37.231
I'm diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.

176
00:13:40.131 --> 00:13:41.300
The doctor said...

177
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.511
I'm going to die.

178
00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:58.767

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

179
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.371
Are you sleeping?

180
00:14:12.731 --> 00:14:14.201
I should be.

181
00:14:15.741 --> 00:14:17.570
You should eat better.

182
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.040
You lost weight.

183
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.810
Take care of yourself.

184
00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:25.050
Gosh.

185
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.981
- Woo Jae. - Yes?

186
00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:31.351
From now on, if Dad contacts you,

187
00:14:31.351 --> 00:14:33.820
you must tell me, okay?

188
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.190
Why aren't you answering?

189
00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.761
Okay, I heard you.

190
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:50.810
About that doctor of Internal Medicine...

191
00:14:51.341 --> 00:14:54.640
- Yes? - He seems nice.

192
00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.550
Right.

193
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.511
But why are you so cold to him?

194
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.680
What do you mean?

195
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.951
You weren't shopping at a supermarket.

196
00:15:04.951 --> 00:15:08.091
You paid him immediately without thanking him first.

197
00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:11.560
You should treat him better.

198
00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:15.900
He seems to like you.

199
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.430
Stop talking nonsense, and go to sleep.

200
00:15:21.241 --> 00:15:22.601
Do you like him too?

201
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.140
Am I wrong?

202
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.680
Why aren't you answering? Do you like him or not?

203
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.680
It doesn't matter...

204
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.351
whether I like him or not.

205
00:15:37.351 --> 00:15:40.621
Of course, it does. It will be a great romance.

206
00:15:40.621 --> 00:15:43.121
You've never experienced true love before.

207
00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:46.530
That's not a way to live.

208
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.300
Woo Jae, do you know this?

209
00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:54.971
Mom dated Dad...

210
00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:58.140
since she was 20.

211
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.170
They loved each other passionately.

212
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.940
- So you know. - Gosh.

213
00:16:02.241 --> 00:16:04.780
I know more about it than you do.

214
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.320
Look how their passionate love turned out in the end.

215
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.251
Mom...

216
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.660
passed away before he could say goodbye.

217
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:23.831
Do you still want to care about love?

218
00:16:44.991 --> 00:16:48.261
I'm diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.

219
00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:50.261
(Diagnosis)

220
00:16:50.261 --> 00:16:53.591
The doctor said I'm going to die.

221
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.961
- Hey. - Stay still.

222
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:25.290
Are you giving up?

223
00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.501
- Goodness. - It's too heavy.

224
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:29.130
What? I can't hear you.

225
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:32.171
- Have some coffee. - Thank you.

226
00:17:32.171 --> 00:17:34.171
- Here you go. - Gosh.

227
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.441
Are you coming from the hospital?

228
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.911
How is your brother?

229
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.651
How do we know?

230
00:17:45.681 --> 00:17:47.820
- How? - Why wouldn't we?

231
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.751
We got so many calls...

232
00:17:49.751 --> 00:17:51.951
at the hospital ship and the dormitory.

233
00:17:52.391 --> 00:17:53.991
I'm sorry about that.

234
00:17:53.991 --> 00:17:56.891
It's nothing to be sorry about.

235
00:17:56.891 --> 00:17:58.560
How is your brother?

236
00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.991
Thankfully, he isn't seriously injured.

237
00:17:59.991 --> 00:18:01.901
He was discharged last night.

238
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.570
Is that so? I'm glad to hear that.

239
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.941
Now that everyone is here, shall we get going?

240
00:18:09.941 --> 00:18:11.971
Doctor Kwak isn't here yet.

241
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:14.181
Ms. Choi won't join us today.

242
00:18:14.181 --> 00:18:16.810
She has to be at the hospital for few days.

243
00:18:17.211 --> 00:18:20.310
For how many days? Is she sick?

244
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.080
I think so.

245
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.491
Here's your coffee.

246
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.741
"Leukemia"?

247
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:44.610
Is that leukemia?

248
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.181
Why are you researching it?

249
00:18:48.741 --> 00:18:51.211
- Is someone sick? - No.

250
00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:53.211
I wanted to look up something.

251
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.880
(Preparation for test)

252
00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.161
Shall we start?

253
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.231
Is it necessary to do it again?

254
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.540
It's the most awful type of leukemia.

255
00:19:55.641 --> 00:19:58.850
It's difficult to treat even with chemotherapy.

256
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.880
We must consider hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

257
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.481
Currently, we have no matching donors.

258
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.620
Let's try to find other solutions.

259
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.681
Aren't you Young Eun?

260
00:20:31.911 --> 00:20:34.921
I wasn't sure, but it was you.

261
00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:37.050
What brings you here?

262
00:20:37.451 --> 00:20:38.951
I'm here to get a check-up.

263
00:20:39.191 --> 00:20:41.921
You get a disease or two when you get old.

264
00:20:42.161 --> 00:20:44.761
What about you? Why are you here?

265
00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:46.860
Are you sick or something?

266
00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.060
No. Yes, I mean...

267
00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.370
What are you saying? Are you sick or not?

268
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.070
I should get going. I'm a little busy.

269
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.241
She didn't even greet me properly.

270
00:21:03.411 --> 00:21:05.810
She thinks I'm just the mother of her ex-boyfriend.

271
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.681
What a rude girl.

272
00:21:23.901 --> 00:21:25.701
All right. It's all done.

273
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.600
Please use the teeth in the opposite side to chew for a day,

274
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.741
and avoid eating something too cold or too hot.

275
00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:32.110
All right.

276
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:33.941
What about my medicine?

277
00:21:33.941 --> 00:21:35.981
Please wait outside for it.

278
00:21:36.711 --> 00:21:37.981
Thanks.

279
00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.921
I'm hungry. I want my lunch now, please.

280
00:21:43.921 --> 00:21:46.421
- There is no food. - What do you mean?

281
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:47.860
The microwave broke down,

282
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.761
so she couldn't make any food.

283
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.130
Is that what we're eating today?

284
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.300
Do you want some? It's tasty.

285
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.030
No. I'm so sick of instant noodles.

286
00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.370
Don't eat anything then.

287
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.471
You should be grateful that we still have these.

288
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.471
- Darn it. - Stop whining.

289
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.580
It's not like you haven't eaten anything for days.

290
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.751
Captain Na is leaving.

291
00:22:10.951 --> 00:22:13.481
- Oh, yes. Are you done? - Yes.

292
00:22:14.951 --> 00:22:17.751
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

293
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.120
What's that?

294
00:22:20.391 --> 00:22:22.921
You can't work properly if you eat that kind of food.

295
00:22:27.501 --> 00:22:29.360
Do you want to eat seafood pancake?

296
00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:32.100
- Seafood pancake? - My brother...

297
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.270
runs a restaurant on Jisim Island.

298
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.610
He makes the best seafood pancake in the country.

299
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.880
You gave me such thorough treatment,

300
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.080
and my teeth don't hurt at all now.

301
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.050
I feel so much better.

302
00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.050
I will treat you all to show my gratitude.

303
00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.350
Would 10 pancakes be enough?

304
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.251
But Jisim Island is quite far from here.

305
00:22:52.251 --> 00:22:54.360
It only takes 15 minutes by my boat.

306
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.320
I'll go and bring it before the lunch time ends.

307
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.731
I'll go with him.

308
00:22:59.961 --> 00:23:02.431
Some rice wine would be...

309
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.070
bad, right?

310
00:23:05.171 --> 00:23:08.100
It'd be bad, of course. I know.

311
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.741
No rice wine then.

312
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:14.610
- Yes! - Seafood pancake!

313
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:26.491
Hello? This is the hospital ship.

314
00:23:27.891 --> 00:23:28.961
What?

315
00:23:29.921 --> 00:23:31.261
Call the doctors.

316
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.261
Doctor Song! Doctor Kwak!

317
00:23:34.261 --> 00:23:36.060
There's a patient who can't breathe!

318
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.171
- What's going on? - I'm not sure.

319
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.070
I'm listening. Where are you right now?

320
00:23:43.441 --> 00:23:44.840
He was eating lunch.

321
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.610
I think something is stuck in his throat.

322
00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.411
Dad. Dad!

323
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:53.610
Ma'am. Ma'am?

324
00:23:57.251 --> 00:23:59.221
His face is turning blue.

325
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:01.961
My dad's face is...

326
00:24:02.461 --> 00:24:03.860
I think it's airway obstruction.

327
00:24:04.231 --> 00:24:06.191
My goodness.

328
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:10.360
Ma'am, please stay calm...

329
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:12.671
and put me on speaker.

330
00:24:12.671 --> 00:24:13.800
Okay.

331
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.310
Dad.

332
00:24:21.641 --> 00:24:22.741
Dad...

333
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.511
I got the Coast Guard on the phone.

334
00:24:25.651 --> 00:24:27.721
The golden time for airway obstruction is only four minutes.

335
00:24:27.721 --> 00:24:28.880
I would get there faster.

336
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.290
No, there is someone who can get there faster than you.

337
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.191
Faster than me?

338
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.431
Look at the color of the sea.

339
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:43.001
What a fantastic view.

340
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:48.201
Hi, Hyun. What's up?

341
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.270
Are you on Jisim Island now?

342
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.741
Yes. Why do you sound so serious?

343
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.040
The patient's life is in your hands now.

344
00:24:57.451 --> 00:24:58.651
What did you say?

345
00:24:59.651 --> 00:25:02.320
Dad, please get up.

346
00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:05.751
Place a fist on his solar plexus,

347
00:25:05.751 --> 00:25:07.860
and cover your fist with your other hand.

348
00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:08.991
Okay.

349
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.691
Pull them hard up to his heart.

350
00:25:16.961 --> 00:25:19.830
- It's not working. - Try again.

351
00:25:22.471 --> 00:25:24.070
Please, Joon Young.

352
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.280
Please hurry.

353
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.191
It's not working.

354
00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:42.421
What do I do?

355
00:25:43.661 --> 00:25:46.961
Is my dad going to die like this?

356
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:49.216
Listen to me carefully.

357
00:25:49.241 --> 00:25:51.195
A doctor is on his way to your house,

358
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.370
but the only person who can save your father right now...

359
00:25:55.001 --> 00:25:56.941
is you.

360
00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:01.681
I can't. I can't do it.

361
00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.981
- Dad... - You can do it.

362
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.751
Pull yourself together. You have to save your father. Come on.

363
00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.721
Dad.

364
00:26:13.451 --> 00:26:16.491
- Dad. - Where is he?

365
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.161
Dad.

366
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.191
What happened?

367
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.231
Joon Young, do the Heimlich maneuver.

368
00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:23.630
Do it now.

369
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.870
(Heimlich maneuver, a first aid method for airway obstruction)

370
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.241
- Oh, goodness. - Please move.

371
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.741
Get the other side.

372
00:26:46.251 --> 00:26:47.860
It's not working. I think it's too late.

373
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.501
Try the Heimlich maneuver one more time,

374
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.070
and perform CPR if it doesn't work.

375
00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:10.141
No...

376
00:27:10.481 --> 00:27:12.751
- Dad! - Lay him down.

377
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:18.151
Joon Young, answer me.

378
00:27:18.451 --> 00:27:19.850
Answer me now. What happened?

379
00:27:21.191 --> 00:27:22.820
Dad.

380
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.790
Doctor Cha can't talk right now.

381
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.661
Why not? What happened to the patient?

382
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.231
Dad, you're alive.

383
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.330
Oh, gosh. Dad.

384
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.330
Luckily, the patient is okay now.

385
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.340
But...

386
00:27:45.251 --> 00:27:47.550
Doctor Cha seems to be unconscious.

387
00:27:50.891 --> 00:27:52.590
Unconscious?

388
00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.491
I... I saved a patient with these hands.

389
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:02.901
If I hadn't arrived in time...

390
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:09.270
It's okay.

391
00:28:09.471 --> 00:28:11.270
Stop crying.

392
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.241
Everything turned out well.

393
00:28:29.188 --> 00:28:36.988
(Episode 20 will air shortly.)
