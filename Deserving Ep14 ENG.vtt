1
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.571
What?

2
00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:20.870
They took Mr. Choi.

3
00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:23.910
They said he pierced a patient's heart while applying acupuncture.

4
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.912
What is wrong with this patient?

5
00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:28.181
Wake up.

6
00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:35.855
Wake up.

7
00:00:36.423 --> 00:00:37.390
Wake up.

8
00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:39.592
What will happen to him...

9
00:00:39.592 --> 00:00:41.061
if something bad happens to that patient?

10
00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:46.866
His blood pressure is dropping and pulse is getting faster.

11
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.803
If we take the needle out, he might die from hemophilia cardiac arrest.

12
00:00:49.803 --> 00:00:50.804
Let's go to the operation room.

13
00:00:58.211 --> 00:00:59.813
His hands are shaky.

14
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.681
I saw his hands shake when he applied acupuncture.

15
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:02.782
Is that true?

16
00:01:03.316 --> 00:01:05.585
Are his hands shaky?

17
00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:08.154
That is...

18
00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:10.023
Where did he apply acupuncture?

19
00:01:10.023 --> 00:01:12.826
Hegu, quchi, zusanli,

20
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.694
and zhongwan.

21
00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:16.262
Okay.

22
00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:19.466
That's zhongwan. He did it then.

23
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.103
The patient has a needle there.

24
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:26.606
(Operation Room)

25
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:33.980
There's so much blood.

26
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.815
That oriental medicine doctor is a quack.

27
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.125
This is strange.

28
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:47.360
What is strange?

29
00:01:47.994 --> 00:01:50.730
Blood wouldn't pool like this from getting pierced by a needle.

30
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.031
What's the problem?

31
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:09.649
Anyway,

32
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.585
the two testimonies are contradicting each other.

33
00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:14.654
We'll have to hear from the person directly involved.

34
00:02:14.654 --> 00:02:17.123
They say he's in surgery. Let's wait for a while.

35
00:02:17.123 --> 00:02:18.124
Then,

36
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:21.261
will everything settle if he says that Master Choi didn't pierce him?

37
00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:23.563
Is that enough?

38
00:02:23.563 --> 00:02:25.965
What is this?

39
00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:31.938
Choi Chun Sool also had a medical malpractice 20 years ago.

40
00:02:31.938 --> 00:02:33.440
What is that?

41
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.575
A patient almost died...

42
00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:37.243
from medicine prescribed by the clinic.

43
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:40.713
He was put on probation.

44
00:02:40.713 --> 00:02:42.515
If he has a record like this,

45
00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.517
it's going to be really disadvantageous to him.

46
00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:48.388
What happened 20 years ago?

47
00:02:48.388 --> 00:02:50.990
You don't have to know that.

48
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.228
Listen to me carefully.

49
00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:58.364
I'm okay.

50
00:02:58.364 --> 00:03:02.368
Nothing should weaken you.

51
00:03:02.368 --> 00:03:04.404
No matter who says anything,

52
00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:07.040
if you listen to them, you will be defeated.

53
00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:08.741
What do you mean?

54
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.210
You won't be defeated by someone else.

55
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.078
You'll be defeated by yourself.

56
00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.816
Just don't forget...

57
00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:19.886
why you wanted to become a doctor in the first place.

58
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.690
Stop being swayed by other people.

59
00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:36.803
He's not our patient.

60
00:03:36.803 --> 00:03:38.705
I can't find anything with only his name.

61
00:03:38.972 --> 00:03:40.173
He doesn't have a phone,

62
00:03:40.173 --> 00:03:42.041
and I can't find anything about his family.

63
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.376
He's a homeless person.

64
00:03:43.643 --> 00:03:44.644
What?

65
00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:47.046
I found the clothes the patient was wearing.

66
00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:48.281
- Okay. - Why?

67
00:03:54.554 --> 00:03:56.256
(Aspirin)

68
00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:57.457
It's aspirin.

69
00:04:03.463 --> 00:04:05.765
Hello, I'm from the police.

70
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.069
The patient was taking aspirin.

71
00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.905
That's why it was hard to stop his bleeding,

72
00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:14.073
and he received surgery in this urgent situation.

73
00:04:14.073 --> 00:04:17.410
Really? That doctor almost killed this man.

74
00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:19.546
Look at this.

75
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.982
If you see this X-ray,

76
00:04:23.116 --> 00:04:26.419
the needle is piercing the heart upwards.

77
00:04:27.754 --> 00:04:30.557
Even if there was a mistake applying acupuncture and left it there,

78
00:04:30.557 --> 00:04:33.793
the needle doesn't usually face upwards.

79
00:04:33.793 --> 00:04:36.229
How do you know that?

80
00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.265
Also, that doctor has been applying...

81
00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:42.435
acupuncture for over 50 years.

82
00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:45.104
He never made a mistake like that.

83
00:04:45.104 --> 00:04:46.372
How do you know that?

84
00:04:47.273 --> 00:04:48.341
I'm...

85
00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:51.010
his granddaughter.

86
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.011
What?

87
00:04:55.848 --> 00:04:58.284
The receiver cannot pick up your call.

88
00:05:05.725 --> 00:05:06.859
Did something happen?

89
00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:08.928
There was a malpractice patient from an oriental medicine clinic.

90
00:05:09.062 --> 00:05:10.697
They're saying that a needle pierced his heart.

91
00:05:10.697 --> 00:05:13.833
A doctor pierced someone's heart with a needle?

92
00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:16.069
That's ridiculous.

93
00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.904
You would know this.

94
00:05:17.904 --> 00:05:19.339
Does this happen sometimes?

95
00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.976
No. It should never happen.

96
00:05:23.576 --> 00:05:25.712
What kind of incompetent doctor did this?

97
00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:28.114
The name of this oriental medicine clinic...

98
00:05:28.548 --> 00:05:30.083
is Haeminseo.

99
00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:31.150
What?

100
00:05:33.586 --> 00:05:36.356
The patient is a homeless person...

101
00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:38.291
who frequently visited that clinic.

102
00:05:51.771 --> 00:05:56.409
You can't ride this car whenever you want.

103
00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.344
The patient is awake.

104
00:05:58.344 --> 00:06:00.647
Let's go. Follow me, I know this place well.

105
00:06:00.647 --> 00:06:01.648
Hurry.

106
00:06:06.686 --> 00:06:07.687
Yeon Kyung.

107
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.729
I'm the attending physician.

108
00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:17.897
Are you?

109
00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:20.099
Why are you keep calling her?

110
00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.402
Did you perform surgery on him?

111
00:06:22.402 --> 00:06:23.403
Yes.

112
00:06:23.803 --> 00:06:26.406
He just woke up.

113
00:06:26.406 --> 00:06:27.974
He's capable of testifying.

114
00:06:27.974 --> 00:06:30.009
Okay, where is he?

115
00:06:30.543 --> 00:06:32.211
Follow me.

116
00:06:36.082 --> 00:06:40.053
Isn't he the homeless person from last time?

117
00:06:42.722 --> 00:06:46.159
Grandpa didn't do this, did he?

118
00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.360
Of course, he didn't.

119
00:06:47.727 --> 00:06:50.096
You know well that he wouldn't do this.

120
00:06:50.663 --> 00:06:52.231
How did this happen?

121
00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:55.134
What happened?

122
00:06:56.602 --> 00:06:57.970
Don't worry.

123
00:06:58.137 --> 00:06:59.605
He woke up.

124
00:06:59.972 --> 00:07:01.941
We'll find out what happened.

125
00:07:07.346 --> 00:07:08.481
I told you.

126
00:07:09.182 --> 00:07:11.884
I'm not sure what happened.

127
00:07:12.218 --> 00:07:16.255
I received acupuncture, and this happened on my way out.

128
00:07:16.756 --> 00:07:18.758
The person who applied this will know...

129
00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:20.660
how he applied it...

130
00:07:20.927 --> 00:07:23.529
and if he took the needle out or not.

131
00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:26.265
I don't know anything.

132
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.367
I'm...

133
00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:31.337
just a victim.

134
00:07:31.604 --> 00:07:32.905
I'm the victim.

135
00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:37.143
Mr. Kim, that is not what happened.

136
00:07:37.143 --> 00:07:40.980
Are you suggesting that I did that to myself or something?

137
00:07:41.514 --> 00:07:43.449
Gosh, I knew...

138
00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:46.819
this was going to happen when I saw his hands shaking.

139
00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:49.956
So, you are saying that...

140
00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:52.358
the person who applied acupuncture...

141
00:07:52.358 --> 00:07:54.994
was Master Choi, right?

142
00:07:54.994 --> 00:07:57.063
Yes, that's what I said.

143
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.500
That old man pierced the needle...

144
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.604
through here. Right here.

145
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:08.741
I had closed my eyes,

146
00:08:08.908 --> 00:08:12.145
so I don't know if he took out...

147
00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:13.513
the needle or not.

148
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.581
And after that, while I was walking out,

149
00:08:16.883 --> 00:08:18.484
all of a sudden,

150
00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:21.020
it felt like the world was spinning.

151
00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:24.590
Gosh, what should I do?

152
00:08:25.825 --> 00:08:28.795
I think it's pretty clear that it was Master Choi's fault.

153
00:08:35.134 --> 00:08:38.237
That means there is nothing wrong with your stomach.

154
00:08:38.237 --> 00:08:40.173
What? No, that can't be.

155
00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:43.810
Even now, I feel bloated. It's killing me.

156
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.579
What? Do you think...

157
00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:48.514
I am lying or something?

158
00:08:48.915 --> 00:08:51.617
No, no! I want...

159
00:08:52.084 --> 00:08:55.421
the director to apply acupuncture.

160
00:08:56.556 --> 00:08:57.890
Power and money.

161
00:08:58.491 --> 00:09:00.259
It's hard for a person to get them,

162
00:09:02.028 --> 00:09:05.198
but it's easy to be trampled on by them.

163
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.691
You took longer than I expected.

164
00:10:06.926 --> 00:10:07.960
Have a seat.

165
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.739
Why did you do that?

166
00:10:19.906 --> 00:10:21.841
I think you already know why.

167
00:10:22.008 --> 00:10:23.109
Then...

168
00:10:25.177 --> 00:10:26.979
did you do that because of me?

169
00:10:29.048 --> 00:10:32.585
It wasn't only because of you.

170
00:10:34.553 --> 00:10:37.256
It's not hard for me to get rid of...

171
00:10:38.557 --> 00:10:40.226
such an old-fashioned clinic.

172
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.132
Don't listen to him.

173
00:10:46.198 --> 00:10:48.701
Don't receive anything from them.

174
00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:55.341
What did you say?

175
00:10:55.808 --> 00:10:58.444
What is the problem? Are you saying even you...

176
00:10:58.544 --> 00:10:59.946
can't do anything about it?

177
00:10:59.946 --> 00:11:02.315
- I am a doctor. - Yes, you are.

178
00:11:03.616 --> 00:11:06.986
You're a doctor who is talented in applying acupuncture.

179
00:11:07.253 --> 00:11:09.055
That is why...

180
00:11:09.422 --> 00:11:12.792
you're the only one who can do this for me.

181
00:11:12.792 --> 00:11:14.927
You can try to earn money by practicing medicine,

182
00:11:15.761 --> 00:11:17.596
and I like money too.

183
00:11:18.264 --> 00:11:20.800
But there are things you should not do as a doctor.

184
00:11:22.001 --> 00:11:24.170
I am going to pretend that I did not hear you say that.

185
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.541
You do that.

186
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:32.078
You can just go back to Joseon like that.

187
00:11:32.912 --> 00:11:35.314
But you know,

188
00:11:35.348 --> 00:11:38.918
that old man would spend the rest of his life in prison.

189
00:11:41.253 --> 00:11:44.824
And the life he has built up as a doctor all his life...

190
00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:47.159
will be over.

191
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.295
It's all because of you.

192
00:11:56.936 --> 00:11:59.672
No, you do not need to do that.

193
00:12:01.741 --> 00:12:03.476
I will protect him.

194
00:12:11.384 --> 00:12:14.754
You can only be Heo Im when you have needles in your hand.

195
00:12:16.522 --> 00:12:18.257
You can try all you want.

196
00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:22.361
You won't be able to do anything.

197
00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:23.856
Where have you been?

198
00:13:24.623 --> 00:13:26.559
I needed to check something.

199
00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:27.960
That patient...

200
00:13:28.627 --> 00:13:30.296
is lying, right?

201
00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:35.534
If he keeps lying, what will happen to Grandfather?

202
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:38.704
Do not worry. Nothing will happen to him.

203
00:13:39.038 --> 00:13:40.739
I will make sure of that.

204
00:13:46.045 --> 00:13:49.348
Please, can you not change your mind?

205
00:13:49.748 --> 00:13:51.784
You are the only one who can prove...

206
00:13:52.384 --> 00:13:54.086
that Master Choi is innocent.

207
00:13:54.086 --> 00:13:55.387
Gosh.

208
00:13:55.955 --> 00:13:58.924
I told you already that I don't know anything.

209
00:13:58.924 --> 00:14:01.560
And I just said what I know...

210
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.363
and what I remember.

211
00:14:05.898 --> 00:14:07.967
You have seen Master Choi for a long time.

212
00:14:08.033 --> 00:14:10.102
You know what he is like.

213
00:14:10.102 --> 00:14:12.438
What would I know about him?

214
00:14:12.438 --> 00:14:14.406
He just visited the station...

215
00:14:14.673 --> 00:14:18.410
and applied acupuncture a few times. I only went there as it was free.

216
00:14:19.578 --> 00:14:22.882
Well, I know for sure that he shakes his hands often.

217
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.485
- I know that much. - Mr. Kim.

218
00:14:37.429 --> 00:14:39.765
I do not know why you are doing this,

219
00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:41.367
but if you tell the truth,

220
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.969
I will not blame you for anything.

221
00:14:44.036 --> 00:14:45.504
So please, just once...

222
00:14:45.504 --> 00:14:48.607
Wait, wait. Are you...

223
00:14:48.874 --> 00:14:51.243
threatening the victim when you are...

224
00:14:52.178 --> 00:14:53.445
the perpetrator?

225
00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:56.182
If you keep doing this, I will call the detective.

226
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.555
Is it because of money?

227
00:15:04.089 --> 00:15:05.891
I did that once.

228
00:15:06.592 --> 00:15:09.128
I applied acupuncture for money once. But...

229
00:15:12.198 --> 00:15:14.833
I have never hurt people with the needles.

230
00:15:17.503 --> 00:15:19.605
What are you trying to say?

231
00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:21.273
I told you I don't know about this.

232
00:15:22.274 --> 00:15:23.442
Acupuncture needles...

233
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.845
were made to save people.

234
00:15:29.148 --> 00:15:32.451
They are not weapons created to hurt others who are different from them.

235
00:15:35.955 --> 00:15:37.823
So, please,

236
00:15:38.724 --> 00:15:40.426
can you not think about...

237
00:15:41.894 --> 00:15:44.296
how Master Choi has helped you with those needles?

238
00:15:49.501 --> 00:15:50.803
Please, Mr. Kim.

239
00:16:58.304 --> 00:16:59.505
Grandfather...

240
00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:03.075
wouldn't have done that.

241
00:17:04.043 --> 00:17:07.446
Yes, they will call us by tomorrow.

242
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.214
Don't worry.

243
00:17:10.316 --> 00:17:14.219
Of course. But you need to keep your promise too.

244
00:17:32.137 --> 00:17:34.039
Are you not feeling well, Chun Sool?

245
00:17:41.013 --> 00:17:43.215
It's just the same as 20 years ago.

246
00:17:43.215 --> 00:17:46.085
You haven't changed your bad behavior.

247
00:17:46.618 --> 00:17:47.786
Don't you ever get sick of it?

248
00:17:47.786 --> 00:17:50.255
It's the only talent I have. What can I do then?

249
00:17:50.255 --> 00:17:52.257
You utilize someone else's talent...

250
00:17:52.257 --> 00:17:54.893
and make money and get power with that.

251
00:17:54.893 --> 00:17:56.195
You've been doing that all of your life.

252
00:17:56.195 --> 00:17:58.530
As if on cue, whenever necessary,

253
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.468
Heo Jun and Heo Im appear right in front of me.

254
00:18:02.468 --> 00:18:05.804
When you brought Heo Jun, you used him to your liking...

255
00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:08.707
and lived off his name so much. That was enough.

256
00:18:08.707 --> 00:18:10.175
Even when you got old now,

257
00:18:10.409 --> 00:18:11.610
you are doing it again?

258
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.011
At that time,

259
00:18:13.212 --> 00:18:15.547
Heo Jun went back to you, right?

260
00:18:15.547 --> 00:18:16.615
So...

261
00:18:17.116 --> 00:18:19.985
you made a plan at that time too.

262
00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:24.857
You know what kind of choice Heo Jun made then.

263
00:18:25.424 --> 00:18:27.326
Because of that choice,

264
00:18:28.193 --> 00:18:30.629
you really had a hard time. Have you forgotten that?

265
00:18:30.763 --> 00:18:34.032
I don't mind this.

266
00:18:34.032 --> 00:18:36.135
Because of what happened then,

267
00:18:36.135 --> 00:18:38.404
you forced my son-in-law out. Compared to that...

268
00:18:38.404 --> 00:18:40.305
this is nothing.

269
00:18:41.473 --> 00:18:45.411
So don't lay your hands on Heo Im!

270
00:18:47.312 --> 00:18:48.614
This time,

271
00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:52.384
it won't end as probation.

272
00:18:52.618 --> 00:18:56.321
Now I understand why Heo Jun was worried because of you.

273
00:18:56.321 --> 00:18:59.091
As Heo Jun said, you're just...

274
00:18:59.091 --> 00:19:01.927
that much of a person.

275
00:19:20.012 --> 00:19:21.346
This is the last thing I'm asking you.

276
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.881
If you do me a favor this time,

277
00:19:22.881 --> 00:19:24.583
I will help clearing Chun Sool of false accusation,

278
00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:26.251
and I will never ask you anything again.

279
00:19:28.487 --> 00:19:30.656
I have fulfilled your requests so far...

280
00:19:30.656 --> 00:19:32.991
not to satisfy your desire.

281
00:19:34.092 --> 00:19:37.596
I have done it because I thought they were also patients.

282
00:19:37.596 --> 00:19:38.864
I know that too.

283
00:19:38.864 --> 00:19:43.135
Then you should understand why I cannot do you a favor now.

284
00:19:43.135 --> 00:19:46.238
Do you want Chun Sool to go to jail in the end?

285
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.676
Even then, Chun Sool and I...

286
00:19:50.976 --> 00:19:53.579
will be able to do what is right as doctors.

287
00:19:55.514 --> 00:19:57.716
A doctor is known for his attitude of mind,

288
00:19:57.716 --> 00:19:59.651
not for false honor.

289
00:20:00.285 --> 00:20:01.286
You can earn...

290
00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.556
a lot of things by the prescription I gave you,

291
00:20:06.492 --> 00:20:08.927
but you can never beat Chun Sool.

292
00:20:10.896 --> 00:20:12.130
You will see.

293
00:20:13.332 --> 00:20:15.534
After all, the one who will leave his name behind...

294
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:17.603
will not be Choi Chun Sool,

295
00:20:19.071 --> 00:20:20.906
but me, Ma Seong Tae.

296
00:20:38.056 --> 00:20:39.424
At that time, 20 years ago,

297
00:20:40.626 --> 00:20:42.594
you also made a plan like this.

298
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.864
Probably my dad...

299
00:20:46.832 --> 00:20:48.667
tried to even things up.

300
00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:50.102
Now that you found out,

301
00:20:50.569 --> 00:20:53.238
you should know what you have to do.

302
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.508
You are a doctor too, Grandpa.

303
00:20:56.508 --> 00:20:57.509
So?

304
00:20:57.509 --> 00:21:01.246
How... How could you do something like that to a human body?

305
00:21:01.246 --> 00:21:03.115
And did someone die?

306
00:21:04.483 --> 00:21:06.151
They all wanted something in return.

307
00:21:06.151 --> 00:21:08.086
They did it because they wanted to do so.

308
00:21:08.086 --> 00:21:09.955
Who on earth is Heo Im?

309
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:12.958
Who is he to do all of this?

310
00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:15.060
If only you were half as competent as he was,

311
00:21:15.594 --> 00:21:16.762
I wouldn't have done this!

312
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:37.115
Are you not feeling well?

313
00:21:37.115 --> 00:21:38.116
What?

314
00:21:38.517 --> 00:21:41.286
No, I'm fine.

315
00:21:41.286 --> 00:21:43.322
You have high blood pressure, right?

316
00:21:43.422 --> 00:21:44.790
Yes.

317
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.326
You're taking Aspirin, right?

318
00:21:47.326 --> 00:21:49.461
I am. So?

319
00:21:49.461 --> 00:21:52.397
It's dangerous if you get your heart pierced in that condition.

320
00:21:53.565 --> 00:21:54.833
Did you know that?

321
00:21:54.833 --> 00:21:55.834
What?

322
00:21:56.234 --> 00:21:59.371
What do you mean?

323
00:21:59.371 --> 00:22:01.139
Aspirin is...

324
00:22:01.139 --> 00:22:04.076
a medicine that keeps blood from coagulating.

325
00:22:04.076 --> 00:22:05.811
So when you get wounded,

326
00:22:05.978 --> 00:22:08.013
it can make the bleeding hard to stop.

327
00:22:08.814 --> 00:22:12.651
You might have been in a great danger.

328
00:22:15.454 --> 00:22:17.122
Do it upwards.

329
00:22:17.623 --> 00:22:19.291
Hold the needle slantly.

330
00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:22.494
Thrust it in deep into your stomach.

331
00:22:22.494 --> 00:22:25.030
This needle is so fine...

332
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.498
that even if it touches your heart,

333
00:22:26.498 --> 00:22:28.033
the bleeding will stop soon.

334
00:22:28.033 --> 00:22:29.201
It won't hurt you at all.

335
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:30.869
Well, I...

336
00:22:31.403 --> 00:22:33.572
have high blood pressure. Is that...

337
00:22:33.572 --> 00:22:34.606
Come on.

338
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.576
I am a director of an oriental medicine hospital.

339
00:22:37.576 --> 00:22:39.111
I won't put you in danger.

340
00:22:40.412 --> 00:22:41.780
Someone who ordered you...

341
00:22:42.614 --> 00:22:44.449
didn't tell anything about it, did he?

342
00:22:46.251 --> 00:22:47.352
Well...

343
00:22:48.987 --> 00:22:52.257
Who... Who are you, doctor?

344
00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:56.762
- Don't you remember me? - Pardon?

345
00:22:56.762 --> 00:22:58.530
At Seoul Station, a few days ago,

346
00:22:59.297 --> 00:23:00.465
I was there with Heo Bong Tak.

347
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.935
Heo Bong Tak...

348
00:23:05.904 --> 00:23:08.173
Mr. Choi Chun Sool of Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic...

349
00:23:09.074 --> 00:23:10.442
is my grandfather.

350
00:23:11.343 --> 00:23:12.344
What?

351
00:23:14.946 --> 00:23:16.548
(Police)

352
00:23:16.548 --> 00:23:18.617
Please investigate it one more time.

353
00:23:18.617 --> 00:23:20.352
It was not Master Choi's fault.

354
00:23:20.986 --> 00:23:24.556
Gosh, you are so persistent.

355
00:23:24.556 --> 00:23:26.425
You've been saying the same thing for hours.

356
00:23:26.425 --> 00:23:27.726
Don't you get tired of it?

357
00:23:27.726 --> 00:23:28.994
If you cannot believe it,

358
00:23:28.994 --> 00:23:31.963
I can prove it by applying the needle on my body myself.

359
00:23:39.805 --> 00:23:40.972
Look at this carefully.

360
00:23:41.773 --> 00:23:43.442
This spot is called zhongwan.

361
00:23:44.643 --> 00:23:47.045
I will pierce the needle into here straight.

362
00:23:48.447 --> 00:23:49.448
My goodness.

363
00:23:50.782 --> 00:23:53.819
Until I can feel the needle in and out of the stomach,

364
00:23:53.985 --> 00:23:56.188
I will thrust it about 9cm deep.

365
00:24:00.258 --> 00:24:03.528
See? You cannot pierce the heart at all if you do this.

366
00:24:03.795 --> 00:24:07.299
However, that patient had the needle slanted deep into his body.

367
00:24:13.705 --> 00:24:14.806
See?

368
00:24:15.707 --> 00:24:17.309
I am fine, right?

369
00:24:18.977 --> 00:24:20.545
When a doctor applies acupuncture,

370
00:24:20.545 --> 00:24:23.048
he puts all his mind into his hand.

371
00:24:23.248 --> 00:24:26.118
How can he not differentiate the feeling...

372
00:24:26.118 --> 00:24:28.053
of piercing the stomach walls and the heart of a patient?

373
00:24:29.087 --> 00:24:30.288
We wouldn't know about that.

374
00:24:32.224 --> 00:24:35.160
Master Choi has held the needle in his hand all of his life.

375
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.730
He has treated and saved many people with the needle.

376
00:24:39.464 --> 00:24:41.700
Please, just one more time,

377
00:24:42.367 --> 00:24:44.736
can you take a look at it again?

378
00:24:47.205 --> 00:24:49.174
You are here.

379
00:24:51.343 --> 00:24:52.344
Master Choi!

380
00:24:52.878 --> 00:24:54.513
Master Choi, are you going home?

381
00:24:55.113 --> 00:24:56.782
Can he go home now?

382
00:24:56.782 --> 00:24:59.484
The investigation hasn't finished yet.

383
00:24:59.484 --> 00:25:02.454
The investigation will go on with him unconstrained.

384
00:25:02.454 --> 00:25:05.624
Come here for second inquiry after two days.

385
00:25:05.624 --> 00:25:07.225
That means he's not yet...

386
00:25:07.225 --> 00:25:09.494
Fortunately, the victim woke up,

387
00:25:09.494 --> 00:25:11.396
but we have a testimony by a witness.

388
00:25:12.097 --> 00:25:14.566
If you do not mind, I recommend you...

389
00:25:14.866 --> 00:25:16.334
to make a confession...

390
00:25:16.334 --> 00:25:18.270
What are you saying? A confession?

391
00:25:23.375 --> 00:25:24.776
Let's go home.

392
00:25:25.343 --> 00:25:26.444
Okay, Master Choi.

393
00:25:29.381 --> 00:25:31.349
No, that's wrong.

394
00:25:31.349 --> 00:25:33.151
The truth is not verified yet.

395
00:25:33.151 --> 00:25:35.821
How can you write an article about it? You're out of your mind.

396
00:25:35.821 --> 00:25:37.189
If you ever write anything about it,

397
00:25:37.189 --> 00:25:39.624
we'll sue you for defamation!

398
00:25:39.825 --> 00:25:41.092
Jae Sook, just hang up.

399
00:25:42.227 --> 00:25:43.228
Oh, my.

400
00:25:44.462 --> 00:25:46.731
- Master Choi. - What are you talking about?

401
00:25:46.832 --> 00:25:48.834
Mr. Choi is not that kind of a person.

402
00:26:10.222 --> 00:26:12.624
You punk, what are you doing?

403
00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:15.594
Do not say a thing.

404
00:26:20.899 --> 00:26:23.535
The pulse on your heart is so scattered.

405
00:26:25.036 --> 00:26:26.538
Your heart got so weak...

406
00:26:26.972 --> 00:26:29.207
that you will feel pain more often,

407
00:26:30.275 --> 00:26:32.410
and your hands will tremble more severely.

408
00:26:32.777 --> 00:26:34.512
After all,

409
00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.882
you examined my pulse.

410
00:26:36.882 --> 00:26:38.750
Now you found out how I am.

411
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.652
Why don't you tell Yeon Kyung...

412
00:26:40.986 --> 00:26:43.955
and get surgery?

413
00:26:43.955 --> 00:26:45.423
In due time,

414
00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.360
I will tell her myself.

415
00:26:48.827 --> 00:26:49.895
You...

416
00:26:50.528 --> 00:26:52.731
must not tell a thing to Yeon Kyung.

417
00:26:55.567 --> 00:26:57.135
Does Yeon Kyung know about...

418
00:26:58.003 --> 00:26:59.638
what happened today?

419
00:27:01.072 --> 00:27:04.542
Yeon Kyung performed the surgery on Mr. Kim.

420
00:27:04.542 --> 00:27:06.678
Oh, my. She must have been...

421
00:27:07.245 --> 00:27:09.614
surprised a lot.

422
00:27:10.615 --> 00:27:14.419
Yeon Kyung also firmly believes that you did not do anything wrong.

423
00:27:14.886 --> 00:27:17.289
So please do not worry about it and focus on treating your disease...

424
00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:19.557
You should not worry about it.

425
00:27:21.326 --> 00:27:24.996
Everyone leaves in due time.

426
00:27:25.597 --> 00:27:28.233
I won't leave before my time comes.

427
00:27:31.036 --> 00:27:32.904
At least let me apply acupuncture.

428
00:27:33.805 --> 00:27:35.240
It will help...

429
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.476
relieve the pain and hand tremor.

430
00:28:21.653 --> 00:28:22.821
It is done.

431
00:28:23.788 --> 00:28:24.990
I'm not...

432
00:28:25.991 --> 00:28:28.893
the type of person who repeats himself.

433
00:28:29.427 --> 00:28:31.963
You shouldn't waste your time repeating yourself...

434
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.866
for those who are never going to understand.

435
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:40.171
Don't forget...

436
00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:44.042
what I told you earlier today.

437
00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.315
I'm so tired.

438
00:28:50.415 --> 00:28:53.018
I've been an oriental doctor for 50 years.

439
00:28:54.686 --> 00:28:56.154
It's about time...

440
00:28:57.088 --> 00:28:59.758
I need to retire and rest.

441
00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:19.577
You are here.

442
00:29:19.978 --> 00:29:21.446
How is he?

443
00:29:21.646 --> 00:29:22.781
Fortunately,

444
00:29:23.648 --> 00:29:24.949
he's all right.

445
00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:29.220
How is Grandpa?

446
00:29:32.057 --> 00:29:33.558
He just fell asleep.

447
00:30:46.865 --> 00:30:50.068
I got this for you. It's medicine made with ginseng and antlers.

448
00:30:50.068 --> 00:30:52.070
I don't take herbal medicine.

449
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.539
I made breakfast for you. Have some before you go.

450
00:30:54.706 --> 00:30:56.541
It's your favorite soft tofu stew.

451
00:30:56.541 --> 00:30:58.143
No, thanks. I need to go.

452
00:30:58.143 --> 00:31:01.146
Yeon Kyung, take this then.

453
00:31:01.212 --> 00:31:02.514
I'll see you later.

454
00:31:22.767 --> 00:31:24.302
When I was little,

455
00:31:25.003 --> 00:31:27.672
I thought Grandpa was the coolest...

456
00:31:29.107 --> 00:31:31.142
because he treated patients with only a needle.

457
00:31:33.178 --> 00:31:34.979
Mom was sick,

458
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.283
and I naturally thought he'd treat her.

459
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.287
I resented him for not saving her.

460
00:31:44.722 --> 00:31:47.091
I thought of the best way to hurt him.

461
00:31:48.793 --> 00:31:50.094
That's how I went to medical school.

462
00:31:51.996 --> 00:31:55.166
But I realized only after I became a doctor.

463
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.901
Mom was...

464
00:31:58.636 --> 00:32:00.505
terminally ill then.

465
00:32:03.841 --> 00:32:05.109
Grandpa...

466
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.512
did his best...

467
00:32:09.214 --> 00:32:10.949
to reduce her pain.

468
00:32:13.484 --> 00:32:15.153
It's a bit embarrassing to say,

469
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.422
but I guess...

470
00:32:18.923 --> 00:32:20.625
I was so little back then...

471
00:32:21.492 --> 00:32:23.828
that I needed someone to resent on for my mom's death.

472
00:32:27.065 --> 00:32:28.399
And that was Grandpa.

473
00:32:31.836 --> 00:32:33.538
I realized it only recently.

474
00:32:37.609 --> 00:32:38.810
That I still...

475
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.112
love my grandpa.

476
00:32:43.381 --> 00:32:44.549
That I still trust him.

477
00:32:51.022 --> 00:32:52.523
I don't think...

478
00:32:54.058 --> 00:32:55.326
I can live without him.

479
00:33:05.503 --> 00:33:06.571
I am sorry.

480
00:33:06.971 --> 00:33:08.239
For what?

481
00:33:13.678 --> 00:33:16.581
You're being of great help just by staying beside me.

482
00:33:21.986 --> 00:33:23.521
I want to stay with...

483
00:33:24.422 --> 00:33:26.057
you and him.

484
00:33:27.258 --> 00:33:28.793
I really do.

485
00:33:40.638 --> 00:33:43.908
I'll get you some blankets, so sleep somewhere around here for tonight.

486
00:33:59.857 --> 00:34:03.094
You think we only treat patients here?

487
00:34:04.062 --> 00:34:07.965
For them, this isn't just a place to get acupuncture.

488
00:34:08.266 --> 00:34:10.168
They comfort each other...

489
00:34:10.168 --> 00:34:12.236
and share each other's sorrow here.

490
00:34:15.907 --> 00:34:17.909
That's why you're a doctor by nature.

491
00:34:18.843 --> 00:34:21.579
You become happy when you save them. You feel good when you treat them.

492
00:34:21.579 --> 00:34:23.881
That makes you a doctor. Am I not right?

493
00:34:23.881 --> 00:34:26.884
Don't go somewhere else and head straight home.

494
00:34:33.424 --> 00:34:36.194
I've been an oriental doctor for 50 years.

495
00:34:37.762 --> 00:34:39.197
It's about time...

496
00:34:40.131 --> 00:34:42.834
I need to retire and rest.

497
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.903
He'll have to rot in prison...

498
00:34:45.903 --> 00:34:47.672
when he has not much time left to live.

499
00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:51.876
His entire life as a doctor...

500
00:34:52.577 --> 00:34:54.212
will be doomed at once.

501
00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:56.447
And it'll be because of you.

502
00:35:02.153 --> 00:35:03.654
I don't think I can live...

503
00:35:05.323 --> 00:35:06.657
without him.

504
00:35:07.158 --> 00:35:09.327
What can you do?

505
00:35:10.395 --> 00:35:12.096
If you stay in this world,

506
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:15.099
my grandpa will keep trying to use you.

507
00:35:16.501 --> 00:35:19.837
That will cause Yeon Kyung and her grandpa to suffer.

508
00:35:20.805 --> 00:35:22.039
Don't you get it?

509
00:35:46.931 --> 00:35:50.234
There's a patient who's suffering from cardiac neurosis.

510
00:35:50.501 --> 00:35:51.836
All you need to do is...

511
00:35:52.503 --> 00:35:55.940
put that patient to sleep for a few days.

512
00:36:02.447 --> 00:36:03.915
If you do that for me,

513
00:36:05.016 --> 00:36:07.552
I won't do any harm to Chun Sool.

514
00:36:08.219 --> 00:36:09.921
I won't ask for you anymore either.

515
00:36:20.698 --> 00:36:23.100
Gosh, what do you mean, it's closed today?

516
00:36:23.601 --> 00:36:25.336
We can't get acupuncture?

517
00:36:25.336 --> 00:36:28.206
That's not good. I need to get it.

518
00:36:28.206 --> 00:36:32.510
My body is so sore that it's hard for me to even stand still.

519
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.512
I'm sorry,

520
00:36:34.512 --> 00:36:36.714
but the doctor can't treat you for the time being.

521
00:36:36.714 --> 00:36:38.983
So please go back.

522
00:36:38.983 --> 00:36:40.418
Gosh, no.

523
00:36:40.418 --> 00:36:42.787
- My back hurts so much. - Oh, no.

524
00:36:42.787 --> 00:36:45.456
Ma'am, we'll call you...

525
00:36:45.456 --> 00:36:46.991
when we're open again.

526
00:36:46.991 --> 00:36:48.826
So please go back for today. I'm sorry.

527
00:36:48.826 --> 00:36:51.162
- When will it be? - I'm not sure.

528
00:36:51.162 --> 00:36:52.530
- Hey. - Goodness.

529
00:36:52.663 --> 00:36:53.931
Where's Bong Tak?

530
00:36:54.198 --> 00:36:55.500
He isn't on the second floor.

531
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.169
He left early in the morning. He was dressed in a suit.

532
00:36:58.169 --> 00:37:01.772
He went somewhere well-dressed at this timing. He's so unpredictable.

533
00:37:02.673 --> 00:37:04.342
Your grandfather might know.

534
00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:14.252
Where... Where did this punk go?

535
00:37:14.252 --> 00:37:16.420
They said he went out early in the morning. You don't know?

536
00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.290
Goodness. Did he really...

537
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.825
Gosh, no...

538
00:37:20.992 --> 00:37:23.494
- No... We must stop him. - Grandpa.

539
00:37:23.928 --> 00:37:25.563
We must stop him.

540
00:37:38.809 --> 00:37:39.810
The receiver cannot pick up your call.

541
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.646
Why won't he pick up the phone?

542
00:37:50.721 --> 00:37:54.892
He went to do something he shouldn't be doing with acupuncture.

543
00:37:54.892 --> 00:37:56.861
He shouldn't go that path.

544
00:37:57.194 --> 00:37:59.797
He won't be able to return from that.

545
00:38:02.667 --> 00:38:03.768
I'm sorry.

546
00:38:04.702 --> 00:38:06.170
Why are you sorry?

547
00:38:07.305 --> 00:38:10.374
Being right here next to me is a big support.

548
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.355
Jae Ha, it's me.

549
00:38:24.855 --> 00:38:26.657
Where is Director Ma?

550
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.029
You can't make a mistake this time.

551
00:38:33.497 --> 00:38:34.565
Don't forget...

552
00:38:34.565 --> 00:38:38.536
that Chun Sool's life depends on your hands.

553
00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.742
(My Gum)

554
00:38:48.379 --> 00:38:49.380
(Decline)

555
00:38:59.724 --> 00:39:01.158
(My Gum, Call ended)

556
00:39:38.963 --> 00:39:39.964
Jae Ha.

557
00:39:39.964 --> 00:39:41.065
What are you talking about?

558
00:39:41.065 --> 00:39:43.167
He's on his way to do something dangerous.

559
00:39:43.167 --> 00:39:44.301
We need to stop him.

560
00:39:44.301 --> 00:39:45.936
Calm down.

561
00:39:45.936 --> 00:39:47.004
If we don't,

562
00:39:47.805 --> 00:39:50.007
he'll never be able to be a doctor again.

563
00:39:50.007 --> 00:39:52.076
He won't be able to live then.

564
00:39:56.781 --> 00:39:58.616
Help me.

565
00:40:16.033 --> 00:40:18.035
Stop my brother...

566
00:40:18.569 --> 00:40:21.672
until the general meeting of stockholders ends.

567
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.676
You know his skills.

568
00:40:27.712 --> 00:40:31.082
If I get my brother's shares,

569
00:40:31.449 --> 00:40:32.950
I'll definitely support...

570
00:40:33.317 --> 00:40:35.352
your business.

571
00:40:40.357 --> 00:40:41.425
Let's go.

572
00:40:54.171 --> 00:40:55.673
Is that him?

573
00:40:56.507 --> 00:40:58.509
He's younger than I thought.

574
00:40:58.676 --> 00:41:01.011
He's young, but they say he's really skillful.

575
00:41:01.545 --> 00:41:02.880
Trust him.

576
00:41:06.117 --> 00:41:07.852
The general meeting of stockholders will be held two days later.

577
00:41:07.952 --> 00:41:10.321
Please make him better until then.

578
00:41:11.222 --> 00:41:14.325
We'll give you whatever you want.

579
00:41:16.827 --> 00:41:18.496
Let me see the patient.

580
00:41:27.738 --> 00:41:28.839
He's immersing.

581
00:41:29.607 --> 00:41:31.375
His pulse is sinking and slow.

582
00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.581
He's pale,

583
00:41:37.815 --> 00:41:39.817
his lips are white,

584
00:41:40.384 --> 00:41:42.486
cold breath is coming out from his nose and mouth,

585
00:41:43.154 --> 00:41:45.656
and his fingernails are pale.

586
00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:48.159
His skin of the belly is thin and helpless.

587
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:51.829
Heart deficiency syndrome.

588
00:41:58.335 --> 00:41:59.837
For heart deficiency syndrome,

589
00:42:00.971 --> 00:42:02.072
to neiguan,

590
00:42:04.508 --> 00:42:05.543
shanzhong,

591
00:42:07.912 --> 00:42:09.814
jueyinshu, xinshu,

592
00:42:11.215 --> 00:42:12.716
and zusanli.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

593
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.856
Blood will pump into his heart, and his face will look rosier.

594
00:42:18.956 --> 00:42:20.691
His eyes will shine brighter.

595
00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:24.028
But if I treat...

596
00:42:24.028 --> 00:42:26.096
him for heart excess syndrome...

597
00:42:30.234 --> 00:42:32.903
If I apply it to meridian's Qi source point shenmen,

598
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.139
meridian's opposite point lougu,

599
00:42:35.306 --> 00:42:37.641
jueyinshu's opposite point ximen,

600
00:42:38.976 --> 00:42:41.245
and the opposite point of shaofu and zhongzhu...

601
00:42:42.146 --> 00:42:43.581
The moment I take the needle out,

602
00:42:44.815 --> 00:42:46.717
he won't be able to overcome the energy of the needle...

603
00:42:47.218 --> 00:42:48.419
and faint.

604
00:43:57.087 --> 00:43:58.522
What is wrong with him?

605
00:44:01.058 --> 00:44:02.426
What happened?

606
00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:05.496
What is it?

607
00:44:07.331 --> 00:44:08.365
What happened?

608
00:44:50.007 --> 00:44:51.141
The art of medicine handles...

609
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:53.644
people's lives.

610
00:44:53.944 --> 00:44:55.179
That means...

611
00:44:55.179 --> 00:44:58.182
a doctor should become one with his needles.

612
00:44:59.516 --> 00:45:01.618
The needles will know...

613
00:45:01.719 --> 00:45:04.455
if you have bad notions.

614
00:45:04.922 --> 00:45:07.691
If you successfully cure His Majesty's illness this time,

615
00:45:07.691 --> 00:45:10.627
I will appoint you to whichever position you want.

616
00:45:10.794 --> 00:45:13.230
You will be able to abandon that sickening title of yours.

617
00:45:13.364 --> 00:45:17.468
Also, His Majesty might want to keep you next to him.

618
00:45:33.784 --> 00:45:35.185
Was that it?

619
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.721
That is what happened.

620
00:45:49.133 --> 00:45:51.902
(Haeminseo Oriental Medicine Clinic)

621
00:46:30.507 --> 00:46:31.909
Did you have dinner?

622
00:46:35.779 --> 00:46:37.381
I haven't had it yet.

623
00:46:40.684 --> 00:46:42.986
I made soft tofu stew.

624
00:46:44.988 --> 00:46:46.723
Do you like it by any chance?

625
00:46:52.262 --> 00:46:54.198
I'm actually not good at cooking.

626
00:46:54.798 --> 00:46:55.866
But...

627
00:46:57.267 --> 00:46:59.403
cooking is all about effort, you see.

628
00:47:01.205 --> 00:47:02.539
Even if it's not delicious...

629
00:47:26.096 --> 00:47:27.464
It's okay now.

630
00:47:32.002 --> 00:47:33.170
Everything's all right now.

631
00:47:58.128 --> 00:47:59.563
I heard the needles cry.

632
00:48:00.731 --> 00:48:02.533
I heard that the child died...

633
00:48:04.201 --> 00:48:06.170
soon after I left for the palace.

634
00:48:11.475 --> 00:48:14.111
It must've been the moment when the needles cried.

635
00:48:20.484 --> 00:48:21.552
But today,

636
00:48:22.886 --> 00:48:24.188
they must've been enraged.

637
00:48:25.656 --> 00:48:27.724
Because of the foolish doctor...

638
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.228
who was going against their will.

639
00:48:36.633 --> 00:48:39.403
They're righteous and strong-minded.

640
00:48:44.508 --> 00:48:46.743
I should thank them...

641
00:48:48.645 --> 00:48:49.880
for protecting you.

642
00:48:54.251 --> 00:48:56.520
If you had treated the King that day,

643
00:48:57.721 --> 00:48:59.056
your life...

644
00:49:00.123 --> 00:49:01.458
would've been changed.

645
00:49:04.461 --> 00:49:06.630
If you had harmed that patient earlier today,

646
00:49:10.534 --> 00:49:11.768
you would've...

647
00:49:20.911 --> 00:49:22.613
The man I know...

648
00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:29.620
would've been happy neither way.

649
00:49:31.555 --> 00:49:33.056
I should tell them this too.

650
00:49:36.093 --> 00:49:37.828
I should thank them...

651
00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:42.132
for allowing me to join your destiny.

652
00:49:54.244 --> 00:49:56.113
I do not know what more is left,

653
00:49:58.115 --> 00:49:59.549
but it is still in my hands.

654
00:50:02.653 --> 00:50:04.521
I wonder what awaits me...

655
00:50:05.255 --> 00:50:06.790
at the end of this strange destiny.

656
00:50:27.844 --> 00:50:29.646
I guess you were paid enough to pay for your drink.

657
00:50:36.453 --> 00:50:40.190
You almost got in huge trouble.

658
00:50:42.859 --> 00:50:46.630
Acupuncture is a tool made to save people.

659
00:50:47.097 --> 00:50:50.500
It should never be used as a weapon to hurt others.

660
00:50:51.435 --> 00:50:53.270
So can you please...

661
00:50:53.937 --> 00:50:55.739
remember all the deeds...

662
00:50:57.074 --> 00:50:59.509
Master Choi has done with those needles?

663
00:51:04.114 --> 00:51:05.949
That's not heavy enough.

664
00:51:08.518 --> 00:51:10.754
You sighed like an anxious dog.

665
00:51:11.855 --> 00:51:14.458
So why would you commit something you are not capable of?

666
00:51:14.958 --> 00:51:17.627
I did nothing wrong.

667
00:51:17.627 --> 00:51:18.995
You did nothing wrong?

668
00:51:19.563 --> 00:51:22.766
You hurt yourself. That's the worst thing you could do.

669
00:51:22.766 --> 00:51:25.736
I told you that's not it.

670
00:51:25.736 --> 00:51:26.837
Goodness.

671
00:51:28.004 --> 00:51:31.041
What were you going to do if you died...

672
00:51:31.041 --> 00:51:33.110
without seeing your son's face?

673
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:35.946
Your son lost his house and job...

674
00:51:35.946 --> 00:51:38.248
to pay for your debt.

675
00:51:38.248 --> 00:51:40.917
Did you think he'd be so glad to hear...

676
00:51:40.917 --> 00:51:42.853
that you died because of him?

677
00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:48.658
I brought you some pine nut porridge.

678
00:51:49.993 --> 00:51:51.161
It'll help you...

679
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:53.897
relax yourself.

680
00:51:54.398 --> 00:51:57.167
Well... I have no appetite.

681
00:51:57.167 --> 00:52:00.470
Gosh, you need to recover soon in order to go see your son.

682
00:52:04.174 --> 00:52:07.010
Even if it's not much money,

683
00:52:07.244 --> 00:52:10.080
it's fine as long as it gave him some break.

684
00:52:10.313 --> 00:52:13.150
Hurry and eat up. Eat up...

685
00:52:13.417 --> 00:52:14.718
and get better...

686
00:52:15.285 --> 00:52:17.721
so you can go meet your son.

687
00:52:18.422 --> 00:52:20.090
Here. Eat up.

688
00:52:21.291 --> 00:52:22.826
Goodness.

689
00:52:30.667 --> 00:52:33.870
That's why you dressed up so nicely.

690
00:52:34.604 --> 00:52:36.239
You were worried...

691
00:52:36.506 --> 00:52:38.608
the hospital and the police wouldn't believe you...

692
00:52:39.075 --> 00:52:40.777
if you came here like a homeless man.

693
00:52:58.094 --> 00:53:00.730
Please give me one more chance.

694
00:53:01.631 --> 00:53:06.503
Dr. Heo said he wasn't feeling good today.

695
00:53:08.839 --> 00:53:10.140
I only did...

696
00:53:11.374 --> 00:53:14.778
what Director Ma told me to do.

697
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.914
You...

698
00:53:19.883 --> 00:53:21.551
What do you think you're doing?

699
00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:22.886
That's enough,

700
00:53:24.354 --> 00:53:25.489
Grandpa.

701
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:35.565
Is the incident from 20 years ago about Master Heo Jun?

702
00:53:37.634 --> 00:53:41.938
It'd be a lie to say I didn't resent him...

703
00:53:41.938 --> 00:53:43.840
even the slightest bit.

704
00:53:45.542 --> 00:53:48.011
It was not like he was told to kill someone.

705
00:53:48.345 --> 00:53:49.913
I didn't think it was a big deal...

706
00:53:49.913 --> 00:53:51.882
to worsen someone's health for a short time.

707
00:53:52.015 --> 00:53:54.084
I was cornered because of him.

708
00:53:54.551 --> 00:53:58.555
I couldn't understand why he was ignoring me to keep his belief.

709
00:54:00.223 --> 00:54:02.225
But now, I think it differently.

710
00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:06.162
If he had done that for my sake back then,

711
00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:11.101
I would've felt guilty all my life.

712
00:54:11.434 --> 00:54:13.870
Thanks to him, I was able to...

713
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:16.773
live as a doctor until now.

714
00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:22.479
Whatever position may be...

715
00:54:22.479 --> 00:54:25.282
Whatever people say, your appearance isn't important.

716
00:54:26.483 --> 00:54:30.186
You just need to keep your heart as a doctor.

717
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.557
That way, you can be proud of being a doctor...

718
00:54:33.857 --> 00:54:36.626
and treat patients in your life.

719
00:54:39.563 --> 00:54:42.065
So don't ever think about pulling something silly for my sake.

720
00:54:42.065 --> 00:54:43.700
It's not helping.

721
00:54:44.834 --> 00:54:46.937
Why must I keep repeating myself to make you understand?

722
00:54:47.203 --> 00:54:49.306
You foolish brat.

723
00:54:59.316 --> 00:55:00.984
Do you still not know?

724
00:55:01.585 --> 00:55:03.486
Your twisted perception towards the world...

725
00:55:03.486 --> 00:55:06.356
is hindering your way as a doctor.

726
00:55:10.193 --> 00:55:13.296
Your needle case does not make you a doctor.

727
00:55:13.897 --> 00:55:17.167
You do not know how valuable your talent is. You are pathetic.

728
00:55:36.252 --> 00:55:39.189
(Police Station)

729
00:55:39.189 --> 00:55:41.925
(Serious Crimes Unit)

730
00:55:45.128 --> 00:55:47.230
I sprained my bottom,

731
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:50.934
but Master Choi applied acupuncture and cured it.

732
00:55:50.934 --> 00:55:52.002
Do you want to see it?

733
00:55:52.002 --> 00:55:55.038
Without his acupuncture, I can't live anymore.

734
00:55:55.038 --> 00:55:57.140
- Release him. - Oh, my.

735
00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:58.608
Release Mr. Choi.

736
00:55:58.608 --> 00:56:00.043
Are you going to take care of this?

737
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:02.012
Are you going to take care of my body?

738
00:56:02.012 --> 00:56:05.148
Why should I take care of your body?

739
00:56:05.415 --> 00:56:06.683
I can't live without him.

740
00:56:06.683 --> 00:56:09.319
- Grandmother. - Bong Sik, where are you going?

741
00:56:09.319 --> 00:56:11.821
- Bong Sik. - Gosh.

742
00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:13.923
What are you going?

743
00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.361
Gosh.

744
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:23.133
Gosh, now I can get to work.

745
00:56:23.133 --> 00:56:26.436
Finally, we're starting the second statement...

746
00:56:26.436 --> 00:56:28.938
of Mr. Choi Chun Sool.

747
00:56:29.406 --> 00:56:31.508
- Move over. - Hey.

748
00:56:31.508 --> 00:56:33.376
Move over.

749
00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:38.114
We're here to write a petition for Mr. Choi.

750
00:56:53.296 --> 00:56:54.631
Where did the patient go?

751
00:56:54.631 --> 00:56:56.232
He was here just moments ago.

752
00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.102
He could have run away.

753
00:57:08.445 --> 00:57:09.546
- Thank you. - Thank you.

754
00:57:12.382 --> 00:57:13.383
I...

755
00:57:13.983 --> 00:57:17.020
Mr. Choi, I'm sorry.

756
00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:18.988
I must have been out of my mind.

757
00:57:19.222 --> 00:57:21.658
It's all right. It's all right.

758
00:57:21.658 --> 00:57:24.160
You must have been desperate.

759
00:57:24.894 --> 00:57:26.696
You should get your treatments.

760
00:57:27.097 --> 00:57:28.832
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

761
00:57:29.799 --> 00:57:33.002
I... I know I don't deserve to ask you this,

762
00:57:33.236 --> 00:57:34.904
but...

763
00:57:35.071 --> 00:57:37.707
Does this mean that because of us...

764
00:57:38.041 --> 00:57:40.977
you and Dr. Heo cannot...

765
00:57:42.011 --> 00:57:43.513
You know...

766
00:57:43.513 --> 00:57:45.248
Do not worry, Mr. Kim.

767
00:57:46.015 --> 00:57:49.185
We will visit you once or twice a month.

768
00:57:50.153 --> 00:57:51.154
Really?

769
00:57:58.061 --> 00:57:59.295
- Thank you. - Thank you.

770
00:57:59.896 --> 00:58:02.699
I didn't know that's what happened. I could have caused trouble.

771
00:58:04.634 --> 00:58:07.737
In the end, his patients...

772
00:58:07.737 --> 00:58:09.139
solved the problem for him.

773
00:58:09.739 --> 00:58:11.741
This proves that his life...

774
00:58:12.308 --> 00:58:14.544
is not in vain.

775
00:58:17.147 --> 00:58:18.782
I respect him.

776
00:58:19.015 --> 00:58:20.884
My grandfather is so cool.

777
00:58:24.721 --> 00:58:26.422
I cannot be like him.

778
00:58:29.092 --> 00:58:30.560
The child...

779
00:58:32.195 --> 00:58:35.598
that I could have saved but missed because of my foolishness...

780
00:58:39.836 --> 00:58:41.671
The promise I made to her...

781
00:58:45.008 --> 00:58:46.476
Wait a little longer.

782
00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:48.611
I will come back soon...

783
00:58:48.645 --> 00:58:50.213
and save you.

784
00:59:03.793 --> 00:59:04.928
What was...

785
00:59:05.628 --> 00:59:07.997
the child like?

786
00:59:12.168 --> 00:59:13.803
She is called Yeon Yi.

787
00:59:14.704 --> 00:59:16.806
I do not know much about her.

788
00:59:17.307 --> 00:59:20.109
But I made a promise to her that I would save her.

789
00:59:23.112 --> 00:59:25.315
I saw her.

790
00:59:28.184 --> 00:59:29.452
What did you say?

791
00:59:30.119 --> 00:59:32.088
Where did you see her?

792
00:59:32.388 --> 00:59:34.157
When we went to Joseon last time,

793
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.493
I saw her at...

794
00:59:38.228 --> 00:59:39.329
Master Heo's house.

795
00:59:39.729 --> 00:59:41.064
What's your name?

796
00:59:41.231 --> 00:59:42.432
It is Yeon Yi.

797
00:59:42.532 --> 00:59:43.633
Yeon Yi.

798
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:47.170
I thought you were sick the last time.

799
00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:48.204
Are you all right now?

800
00:59:48.204 --> 00:59:50.707
I am waiting for someone.

801
00:59:51.875 --> 00:59:54.177
A doctor told me...

802
00:59:55.645 --> 00:59:58.548
that he was going to save me.

803
01:00:00.583 --> 01:00:02.418
He was going to come back soon.

804
01:00:03.052 --> 01:00:04.888
He promised me that.

805
01:00:06.556 --> 01:00:08.524
He is going to come back...

806
01:00:09.826 --> 01:00:11.394
and save me.

807
01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:15.465
Do you mean to say...

808
01:00:16.499 --> 01:00:17.867
that she is alive?

809
01:00:23.206 --> 01:00:25.375
You want to go back to Joseon?

810
01:00:25.942 --> 01:00:27.577
I made a promise to her.

811
01:00:28.478 --> 01:00:30.013
I told her that I will save her.

812
01:00:30.613 --> 01:00:32.916
I will come back after I keep my promise.

813
01:00:37.587 --> 01:00:41.190
After that day, I had a heavy heart.

814
01:00:41.691 --> 01:00:44.861
It was a promise I wanted to keep but could not.

815
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:49.732
I want to undo the wrong and start again.

816
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.401
To do that,

817
01:00:53.136 --> 01:00:55.271
I need to save her.

818
01:00:56.539 --> 01:00:59.509
If not, you will...

819
01:01:00.243 --> 01:01:03.246
have a burden in your mind all your life.

820
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.815
You shouldn't.

821
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:07.450
You should go.

822
01:01:10.386 --> 01:01:12.221
But if you go...

823
01:01:19.195 --> 01:01:20.830
I do not know how long it might take,

824
01:01:21.397 --> 01:01:23.132
but I will come back.

825
01:01:26.369 --> 01:01:27.370
Well...

826
01:02:24.394 --> 01:02:26.529
You do not need to treat me.

827
01:02:26.996 --> 01:02:28.064
Just...

828
01:02:28.931 --> 01:02:31.067
leave me to die.

829
01:03:22.819 --> 01:03:24.554
Can't you think about this again?

830
01:03:24.887 --> 01:03:26.522
If I go with you,

831
01:03:26.722 --> 01:03:28.391
I might be of help.

832
01:03:29.425 --> 01:03:30.560
You are saying that again.

833
01:03:31.394 --> 01:03:32.995
I said you cannot come with me.

834
01:03:34.063 --> 01:03:35.798
Did you forget what happened the last time?

835
01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:40.336
If that happens again, my heart will not survive.

836
01:03:42.004 --> 01:03:44.540
I let go of your hand by mistake.

837
01:03:46.142 --> 01:03:50.213
I will be right next to you like this.

838
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.348
Like gum.

839
01:03:52.381 --> 01:03:53.749
You used to complain...

840
01:03:53.749 --> 01:03:56.018
about me taking you there every time.

841
01:03:57.887 --> 01:03:59.555
That was then.

842
01:04:03.926 --> 01:04:06.496
You are a woman I cannot predict.

843
01:04:07.096 --> 01:04:08.931
I do not know what trouble you might cause.

844
01:04:08.931 --> 01:04:11.033
You should behave and just wait for me here.

845
01:04:13.569 --> 01:04:16.205
Why not just leave me for good?

846
01:04:16.639 --> 01:04:18.774
I was thinking about that.

847
01:04:28.251 --> 01:04:30.052
I know you will miss me, but please wait for me.

848
01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.189
I will come back right away after I save her.

849
01:04:35.691 --> 01:04:38.394
You should count to 200.

850
01:04:38.528 --> 01:04:41.430
I will come back before you finish.

851
01:04:54.977 --> 01:04:58.748
While I am gone, if your grandfather...

852
01:05:02.218 --> 01:05:03.386
My grandfather?

853
01:05:05.821 --> 01:05:06.822
What about him?

854
01:05:08.191 --> 01:05:11.227
Take care of him while I am gone.

855
01:05:11.494 --> 01:05:14.564
When I come back, you will not have enough time to do that.

856
01:05:16.299 --> 01:05:17.733
I will come back soon.

857
01:05:33.216 --> 01:05:34.517
Save...

858
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:38.554
that child.

859
01:05:52.768 --> 01:05:54.470
Do not worry.

860
01:05:56.105 --> 01:05:57.540
I will return soon.

861
01:05:58.407 --> 01:05:59.542
And...

862
01:06:01.277 --> 01:06:02.478
return.

863
01:06:13.322 --> 01:06:14.924
That child...

864
01:06:15.591 --> 01:06:18.127
must have been the final test.

865
01:06:21.497 --> 01:06:22.565
You idiot.

866
01:06:23.399 --> 01:06:25.768
You can't come back...

867
01:06:26.168 --> 01:06:28.271
just because you want to.

868
01:06:31.274 --> 01:06:32.408
You won't be able to do...

869
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:35.611
as you want now.

870
01:07:12.248 --> 01:07:13.449
Why is it so quiet?

871
01:07:35.938 --> 01:07:39.642
Our armies will reach Hanyang in two weeks.

872
01:07:48.084 --> 01:07:49.885
My heart is still in pain.

873
01:07:52.221 --> 01:07:54.156
Grandpa, dinner is ready.

874
01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.203
Min Jae, I'll be there in five minutes.

875
01:08:07.203 --> 01:08:08.838
Reserve an operation room and call Professor Jung.

876
01:08:18.381 --> 01:08:19.515
Please.

877
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:32.828
Yeon Yi was at...

878
01:08:33.262 --> 01:08:36.165
Master Heo's house.

879
01:08:42.104 --> 01:08:43.205
What is that?

880
01:08:45.307 --> 01:08:46.442
No.

881
01:08:51.914 --> 01:08:54.650
Master Heo, Mak Gae.
