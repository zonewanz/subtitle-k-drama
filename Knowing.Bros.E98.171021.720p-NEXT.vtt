00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:15.845
("Ask Us Anything" School on a
cool day in October)

2
00:00:20.363 --> 00:00:22.829
Wait, I hear strange noises.

3
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.609
(What's that?)

4
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.673
- It's like in a scary movie!
- Some bizarre alien!

5
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.189
(The bizarre creature appears
with loud noises)

6
00:00:33.213 --> 00:00:36.110
It's still so vivid in my memory.

7
00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:37.673
- What is?
- I had a dream.

8
00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:40.118
We're wondering what the metallic
sound is.

9
00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:41.681
Were you caught in a trap?

10
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.660
(Caught)

11
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.696
- We heard the sound!
- I broke out of it.

12
00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:48.696
But this dream I had, it was so vivid.

13
00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:51.618
He was caught in a trap but
he broke out of it!

14
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.118
(Listen to me, guys!)

15
00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:58.540
I went somewhere in my dream,
and there were a lot of people there.

16
00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:00.689
And they were all clapping.

17
00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.743
I was standing still, but I was holding
a big trophy award.

18
00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.439
It felt so real, what do you think
it means?

19
00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:11.056
- Winning the grand prize!
- Must be about getting an award.

20
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:12.314
The grand prize at the end of the year!

21
00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:16.368
Your dream reminds me of something
so funny on the Internet.

22
00:01:16.423 --> 00:01:19.259
Someone really posted this.

23
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.751
Seo Jang-hoon walked into my living room,

24
00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:24.532
laid out an electric blanket, and slept.

25
00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:26.782
That'd be intruding.

26
00:01:28.403 --> 00:01:29.860
Very much so.

27
00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:33.415
The person who wrote this then asked,
"Should I buy a lotto ticket?"

28
00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.673
The person's asking people to
interpret this dream.

29
00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:39.110
Jang-hoon must've gone there
to sell an electric blanket

30
00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:40.454
Here's a response.

31
00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:43.196
"It means that difficult matters become
resolved and

32
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.610
your business will flourish, and an
unexpected guess will visit you

33
00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:48.728
to tell you a good news."

34
00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:51.712
It's known to be a dream of good fortune
when someone famous comes in.

35
00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:54.345
- It's a good dream!
- I'm relieved then.

36
00:01:54.376 --> 00:01:58.665
So this person interpreted the dream
as a good one, but there are 2 people

37
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.735
who clicked, "I don't agree."

38
00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:04.056
They didn't agree?

39
00:02:04.088 --> 00:02:07.298
A person can dream about us and depending
on how we are, some may say

40
00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:10.439
it's a good dream or a bad ream.

41
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.931
That's why we have to work hard
and be good to others.

42
00:02:12.947 --> 00:02:15.759
How about giving life-advices
to one another?

43
00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:17.337
(Out of nowhere?)

44
00:02:17.384 --> 00:02:18.400
Like a relay?

45
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:19.924
Yes, one after another.

46
00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:21.735
For Jang-hoon...

47
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.821
I'm sure there are many advices to give.

48
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.868
I think you should be cautious
about women.

49
00:02:25.947 --> 00:02:28.321
(A strong one from the get-go)

50
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:31.275
Be careful, and careful again!

51
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:32.876
Plan things well.

52
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.860
Jang-hoon's mad.

53
00:02:34.892 --> 00:02:36.595
I'll make sure to remember.

54
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.868
(Thanks a lot, buddy!)

55
00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.298
(Jang-hoon to Sang-min this time)

56
00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:46.728
For Sang-min, I'd advice about health
more than anything.

57
00:02:46.798 --> 00:02:48.860
He should take care of his health.

58
00:02:48.892 --> 00:02:51.548
He's been very busy lately, extremely
busy, and I'm worried

59
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.517
his body might not be able to handle it.

60
00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:55.971
I wish for Sang-min to be careful
about his health.

61
00:02:56.095 --> 00:02:59.931
I'd like to say the same for Soo-geun,
about being healthy.

62
00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:04.267
You can see it from time to time,
he's losing hair.

63
00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:10.095
(His going bald is out in the open now)

64
00:03:10.353 --> 00:03:14.806
He's in bad shape, he's going bald and
also has gout.

65
00:03:14.853 --> 00:03:18.220
He might lose all of his teeth soon.

66
00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:21.553
That's because you beat him up!

67
00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.789
(It was actually a warning)

68
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.017
No, his teeth have been shaky,

69
00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:27.634
they've gotten weak.

70
00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.204
It really worries me a lot.

71
00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:31.561
We don't have the right to be sick!

72
00:03:31.642 --> 00:03:32.751
I don't show it, see?

73
00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:34.915
We're overlapping with advices
about health.

74
00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.453
I'd like to tell Yeong-cheol something
that was already mentioned.

75
00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:39.993
Don't rush into things, be wary of women.

76
00:03:40.018 --> 00:03:42.110
- How'd you know?
- You've been talking to someone?

77
00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.564
(Yeong-cheol's dating, finally?)

78
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.704
Send her back, Yeong-cheol.

79
00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.868
She said she won't leave, surprisingly.

80
00:03:51.884 --> 00:03:54.610
But the girl keeps going overseas
whenever she's got time.

81
00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.775
(We should congratulate him
if it's true!)

82
00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:02.821
(Got it)

83
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.743
(Someone knocks on the door at that moment)

84
00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:08.275
- Who is it?
- Not confident enough.

85
00:04:11.406 --> 00:04:12.650
(Cute!)

86
00:04:12.697 --> 00:04:14.696
- It's Super Mario!
- How cute!

87
00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:17.017
(Yoon Jung-soo, popular again these days
second time around)

88
00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:19.025
Wow, it's Ha Yeon-soo!

89
00:04:19.064 --> 00:04:21.509
(A famous and lovely actress,
Ha Yeon-soo)

90
00:04:21.572 --> 00:04:24.501
Look at the difference between
the sizes of their faces!

91
00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:26.915
(No Photoshop)

92
00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:29.564
Are you gaining more weight on purpose?

93
00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.290
How can you be the one to say that
to me?

94
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.626
(I've never seen anyone else
with face that big)

95
00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:36.767
Step out a bit, next to the desk.

96
00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:38.282
- Why?
- Let's take a look.

97
00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:41.235
I'm hiding behind this because
I don't want to look fat!

98
00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:43.814
You should exercise.

99
00:04:43.877 --> 00:04:47.243
Soo-geun whispered something when
Jung-soo was about to walk in.

100
00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:49.212
I'm not trying to be funny, seriously.

101
00:04:49.243 --> 00:04:51.376
"What happened to his body?"

102
00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:54.821
"Wow... What happened to his body?"

103
00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:56.634
(And he repeats it)

104
00:04:57.492 --> 00:04:59.092
What about my body?

105
00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.126
(All take a look at his body shape)

106
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.843
Am I missing organs? Body parts?

107
00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:06.148
You look like a kid who took the wrong type
of herbal medicine.

108
00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:07.314
(What'd you say?)

109
00:05:07.322 --> 00:05:10.048
Someone did tell me that I look like
a German kid who's studying abroad.

110
00:05:10.103 --> 00:05:12.329
Why are you wearing a monk's clothing
for school uniform?

111
00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:13.712
(Huge pants on him)

112
00:05:13.822 --> 00:05:15.907
Soo-geun can finally look down at someone.

113
00:05:15.978 --> 00:05:17.095
(Feeling tall)

114
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:18.711
(A confident hello)

115
00:05:19.173 --> 00:05:22.017
There's a cartoon by Go U-yeong
long time ago,

116
00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:24.048
it was called, "Garujigi."

117
00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:25.782
You look like him.

118
00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:27.853
You're shorter than Soo-geun?

119
00:05:27.878 --> 00:05:29.259
(Be quiet!)

120
00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:32.087
Let me introduce myself.

121
00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:36.517
I came from "I know how Jang-hoon
feels now" high school.

122
00:05:36.556 --> 00:05:37.931
My name is Yoon Jung-soo.

123
00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:39.736
How I feel?

124
00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:41.290
You've never been married.

125
00:05:41.322 --> 00:05:43.610
I had to say goodbye to someone,
and I understand now.

126
00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:44.610
(Oh, that!)

127
00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:47.110
It was an imaginary divorce for a TV show,

128
00:05:47.142 --> 00:05:48.618
but I was really sad.

129
00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.001
- He did have a pretended marriage.
- How can amateurs say such a thing?

130
00:05:53.048 --> 00:05:54.993
You're not qualified to talk about going
through a break-up.

131
00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:56.407
That's not the true break-up!

132
00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:58.329
(Can't say anything in front of
a real divorcee)

133
00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:02.502
- What kind of a break-up was it?
- Documents were exchanged.

134
00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:04.720
We had contracts signed too!

135
00:06:05.025 --> 00:06:07.321
Wait, weren't you married for longer
than Jang-hoon?

136
00:06:08.377 --> 00:06:10.243
We were married for 2 years!

137
00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:11.939
How about you?

138
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:16.970
I knew her as a fellow comedian for
13 years, then were "married" for 2!

139
00:06:17.095 --> 00:06:19.134
It's much longer than
what you went through.

140
00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.681
Your face turned red, you look like
my thumb when I stop blood circulation.

141
00:06:25.326 --> 00:06:27.459
(Having so much fun teasing him)

142
00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:29.978
(I hear that often)

143
00:06:30.513 --> 00:06:34.314
I'm done with mine, let's listen
to Yeon-soo's introduction.

144
00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.072
Yeon-soo is really pretty!

145
00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:37.470
Thanks, Hee-chul.

146
00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:39.057
I heard a lot about you from Yeri.

147
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.110
She looks just like Yeri from Red Velvet.

148
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.735
You do look alike!

149
00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:46.618
They both look like turtles.

150
00:06:46.666 --> 00:06:48.266
Let me talk first.

151
00:06:48.314 --> 00:06:50.181
What school did you come from?

152
00:06:50.228 --> 00:06:54.454
From "Older than you think" high school,
and I'm Ha Yeon-soo.

153
00:06:55.112 --> 00:06:56.900
(Nice to meet you!)

154
00:06:57.367 --> 00:06:58.665
She sounds so smart!

155
00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:00.556
You're older than we think?

156
00:07:00.564 --> 00:07:01.337
How old are you?

157
00:07:01.377 --> 00:07:02.220
I'm 28.

158
00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:03.493
28 years old?

159
00:07:03.525 --> 00:07:05.775
That's not old enough for us.

160
00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:07.421
But 28...

161
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:09.626
She looks about 28 though.

162
00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:11.345
(No way!)

163
00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:13.298
That hurt her pride.

164
00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:16.142
(Checking with Jung-soo about
how old she looks)

165
00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:19.376
You didn't know this, but your school
said they changed their name.

166
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:21.189
To "You look exactly your age" high school.

167
00:07:21.214 --> 00:07:22.931
(I really didn't know)

168
00:07:23.002 --> 00:07:25.243
We don't really say nice things
around here.

169
00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:27.009
(It's not so easy here)

170
00:07:27.236 --> 00:07:31.165
She put pink makeup on
to look younger.

171
00:07:31.477 --> 00:07:33.790
Yes, I did go a little overboard today.

172
00:07:33.868 --> 00:07:36.290
- You look like a doll.
- Or a cartoon character.

173
00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:38.603
What's the Russian doll that's stacked
inside of another?

174
00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:40.751
Matryoshka doll!

175
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:44.720
Yeah! She looks like one. You open
the lid and there's another doll.

176
00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:46.359
Look at her skin.

177
00:07:46.517 --> 00:07:49.376
I heard Yeon-soo purposely picked Jung-soo
to come here together,

178
00:07:49.392 --> 00:07:50.993
to look better in comparison.

179
00:07:51.018 --> 00:07:53.626
- That's not true.
- No, we have a secret...

180
00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:55.993
I don't think that's a good idea,
don't touch me.

181
00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:57.471
You make me feel nervous.

182
00:07:57.496 --> 00:07:59.196
What a tough guy!

183
00:08:00.072 --> 00:08:01.720
You gotta reject them from time to time.

184
00:08:01.736 --> 00:08:04.212
He's the best-speaking thumb in the world.

185
00:08:04.392 --> 00:08:07.134
Jung-soo's been so active on TV
even up to very recently,

186
00:08:07.173 --> 00:08:09.040
"The blue-chip" of TV variety shows!

187
00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:11.157
I loved you in "Match Made in Heaven."

188
00:08:11.322 --> 00:08:12.814
That's right!

189
00:08:12.986 --> 00:08:14.586
Hey, Ho-dong!

190
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.243
Don't hang out with these
weird little guys.

191
00:08:17.392 --> 00:08:19.993
You shined the brightest when you worked
with me.

192
00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:23.923
"Exciting Saturday night on fire!"

193
00:08:24.484 --> 00:08:26.720
You should forget about that,
it's been years.

194
00:08:26.745 --> 00:08:28.150
You can't live in the past.

195
00:08:28.195 --> 00:08:29.696
I don't have any other famous phrases.

196
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:32.454
How long will you just talk about
how famous you were before?

197
00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:35.392
Do you know why he decided to come today?

198
00:08:35.455 --> 00:08:37.720
- Why?
- Isn't it to thank me?

199
00:08:37.744 --> 00:08:39.657
- Why?
- I saw it!

200
00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:43.970
Jung-soo said that he had a dream about me
when things were rough.

201
00:08:44.017 --> 00:08:46.470
And things got much better after
having that dream!

202
00:08:46.564 --> 00:08:51.079
I saw your interview, you paid off 85%
of all your debt and it's because of me!

203
00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:55.087
You should've said that when you paid
off all your debt, why'd you leave 15%?

204
00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:58.431
Oh, they're from people who said I can
pay them back later.

205
00:08:58.486 --> 00:09:00.493
- 15% of your total debt?
- Yeah, so they gave me more time.

206
00:09:00.502 --> 00:09:02.501
- Wow, you should be grateful.
- I definitely am.

207
00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:05.103
I'm sure Sang-min understands
really well.

208
00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:08.110
There are some very nice people out there.

209
00:09:08.189 --> 00:09:08.946
It's true.

210
00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:11.759
Is it really like the movies where people
come to your house

211
00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:14.173
and put red stickers, saying that you don't
own them anymore?

212
00:09:14.189 --> 00:09:15.782
Yeah, they came and did that.

213
00:09:15.807 --> 00:09:16.798
Sounds so scary.

214
00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:21.829
Someone kept knocking on my door
like this.

215
00:09:21.877 --> 00:09:24.407
I wasn't feeling well, so I didn't
open the door.

216
00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:27.564
But then I heard, "Let's just
break it open then."

217
00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:30.079
Then I heard this sound...

218
00:09:30.142 --> 00:09:31.415
For real?

219
00:09:31.447 --> 00:09:34.501
I got scared and I finally
opened the door.

220
00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:36.109
"What are you doing?"

221
00:09:36.828 --> 00:09:39.390
And they looked like government
workers.

222
00:09:39.502 --> 00:09:41.454
- Dressed in suits?
- Yeah, in suits.

223
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.220
If I can elaborate...

224
00:09:43.392 --> 00:09:46.946
They have to have a couple of people
who live in that town as witnesses,

225
00:09:46.978 --> 00:09:51.735
that's when the government workers
can bring a locksmith and enter.

226
00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:55.337
Oh, there's a little more
detail you missed.

227
00:09:55.392 --> 00:09:58.400
That's only if the government workers
are from the county office.

228
00:09:58.439 --> 00:10:00.259
No, it's also true for the people
the court send.

229
00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:01.665
Not if there's police present.

230
00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:03.267
Oh, is that right?

231
00:10:03.532 --> 00:10:06.485
I'm always learning something new
on this show!

232
00:10:06.533 --> 00:10:09.157
So anyway, I asked them what they
were doing.

233
00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:14.398
They said that there was a court order
and they had to put on these red stickers

234
00:10:14.423 --> 00:10:17.103
on things that I own.

235
00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:19.110
They put on about 100-something
red stickers.

236
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.759
So if they put a red sticker on your TV
for example, you can't watch it?

237
00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:27.314
You can watch it, but you can't
take it outside.

238
00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:31.829
But the problem was that they put
the sticker on the remote part,

239
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:33.790
the sensor to pick up the remote control
signal.

240
00:10:33.822 --> 00:10:35.978
So the remote control wouldn't work!

241
00:10:36.025 --> 00:10:38.345
(It's useless now)

242
00:10:38.767 --> 00:10:42.532
But I felt like something scary was going
to happen if I peeled it.

243
00:10:42.572 --> 00:10:45.204
So I just folded it like this.

244
00:10:45.252 --> 00:10:48.056
I folded it so I can use the remote.

245
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.321
- You can't peel off the sticker?
- You can't.

246
00:10:50.392 --> 00:10:54.048
- It's against the law.
- You can peel it, but gotta keep it.

247
00:10:54.072 --> 00:10:54.548
Really?

248
00:10:54.573 --> 00:10:57.939
Yes, but if you lose it or throw it away,
you can be prosecuted.

249
00:10:58.275 --> 00:11:01.360
What are we, competing over
how much we know about debt?

250
00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:03.673
(I'm the biggest debtor around here!)

251
00:11:04.384 --> 00:11:09.017
Then the court orders me to leave the house
so they can put it up for auction.

252
00:11:09.025 --> 00:11:14.064
The day I left the house after receiving
that order was my birthday, actually.

253
00:11:15.595 --> 00:11:20.509
So I moved out on my birthday and after
I finished moving everything,

254
00:11:20.525 --> 00:11:23.493
another comedian that I know said,
"You should at least do this,"

255
00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:25.321
and brought out a birthday cake.

256
00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:29.439
I felt like I was gonna die.
Of course I cried.

257
00:11:29.517 --> 00:11:31.056
It was a sad moment.

258
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:33.517
I'm a little choked up now
talking about it.

259
00:11:34.298 --> 00:11:36.118
Nothing like this happened to you,
Yeon-soo?

260
00:11:36.142 --> 00:11:37.978
You haven't gone bankrupt yet?

261
00:11:38.002 --> 00:11:38.993
Sorry about "yet."

262
00:11:39.002 --> 00:11:40.603
I'm helping my family get out of debt.

263
00:11:40.628 --> 00:11:42.290
- Oh really?
- Yes.

264
00:11:42.447 --> 00:11:44.423
So I hope it goes well today.

265
00:11:44.728 --> 00:11:48.071
I heard people call you "Kim Yeong-cheol
in the acting field."

266
00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:52.126
That doesn't make me feel so good.

267
00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:55.204
It'll be better to have someone
cuss you out than that.

268
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.173
Yeah, might as well.

269
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.009
Not that, but you published a book of
your photo collection?

270
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.446
- Yeah.
- I heard it became a best-seller!

271
00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:04.235
I'm also the author of a best-seller.

272
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.775
Wow, really?

273
00:12:05.814 --> 00:12:07.884
You mean you wrote a book, not that
it became a best-seller.

274
00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:10.790
It's because none of you guys read, but
the book I wrote about learning

275
00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:12.728
English is a best-seller!

276
00:12:12.775 --> 00:12:13.657
Really?

277
00:12:13.712 --> 00:12:17.767
So you'd go back and forth from Korea
and other countries to take photos?

278
00:12:17.822 --> 00:12:20.337
Yes, I've been to Russia recently.

279
00:12:20.595 --> 00:12:21.798
- To take photos?
- Yeah.

280
00:12:21.823 --> 00:12:25.720
What are your themes? Photographers
usually have themes in their photos, right?

281
00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:27.344
For me...

282
00:12:27.533 --> 00:12:32.118
I like subjects like you whom I can feel
the beauty of age and experience from.

283
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.009
I like taking photos of grandpas
and grandmas.

284
00:12:36.354 --> 00:12:37.478
I'm a grandpa?

285
00:12:37.517 --> 00:12:40.603
You have a face that says a lot
about your past.

286
00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.032
I love photos likes that.

287
00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:46.485
She's smiling yet the jabs keep coming!

288
00:12:46.924 --> 00:12:48.321
It's not like that!

289
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:53.860
There is beauty to be found in
wrinkles of older people's faces.

290
00:12:54.642 --> 00:12:57.196
It makes you think about life
and its struggles.

291
00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:58.470
It's art.

292
00:12:58.509 --> 00:13:00.251
I brought it, actually.

293
00:13:02.158 --> 00:13:04.181
- You brought something?
- Yes.

294
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:06.789
I brought my camera.

295
00:13:07.595 --> 00:13:08.657
It's a Polaroid.

296
00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.345
- The old kind.
- Polaroid!

297
00:13:10.384 --> 00:13:12.634
- Can I take a picture of you?
- I feel embarrassed now.

298
00:13:12.673 --> 00:13:14.978
I can't believe you want to take
a picture of my face!

299
00:13:15.197 --> 00:13:15.978
Here it goes!

300
00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:18.814
You're not taking a picture of me
actually, sitting behind Ho-dong, right?

301
00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:22.400
(Grabbing everyone's attention)

302
00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:24.728
(I know I'm famous)

303
00:13:24.962 --> 00:13:27.009
(He knows nothing about this, just happy
to get his solo shot)

304
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.939
Leave it flipped over like this
and see it in 20 minutes.

305
00:13:30.338 --> 00:13:33.829
(A special gift of a photo
Yeon-soo prepared)

306
00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:36.454
(But I'm the main character here!)

307
00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:41.306
For both of you, your body proportions
are unrealistic.

308
00:13:41.478 --> 00:13:44.306
One's got a really small face
and the other...

309
00:13:44.338 --> 00:13:45.642
He's not quite 5' 6", right?

310
00:13:45.705 --> 00:13:49.735
Nowhere near! He's not even 5' 4"
just at a glance.

311
00:13:49.752 --> 00:13:52.860
Is he taller than you, Soo-geun?
You're taller?

312
00:13:52.885 --> 00:13:54.111
I told you I'm 5' 4".

313
00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:58.775
You know your height follows your name,
right? That's why you're shrunk. [pun]

314
00:13:59.387 --> 00:14:02.314
You're "Jung-soo," that's why people
can see the top of your head. [pun]

315
00:14:02.734 --> 00:14:04.806
(Neither back down in this dissing war)

316
00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:06.079
Wait a second.

317
00:14:06.134 --> 00:14:09.275
Can't you tell I'm taller than you just
from seeing me walking towards you?

318
00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:12.235
Come over here if you're so sure!

319
00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:15.603
I'm sure I can beat you at least,
among all the people.

320
00:14:15.716 --> 00:14:17.189
It hurts my ego.

321
00:14:17.609 --> 00:14:19.923
What's your height listed as
in your profile?

322
00:14:19.963 --> 00:14:21.446
I'm 165 cm for real.

323
00:14:21.478 --> 00:14:22.728
I'm 164.7.

324
00:14:24.548 --> 00:14:26.392
But Soo-geun looks taller.

325
00:14:27.486 --> 00:14:29.017
(Let's measure them!)

326
00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:31.900
Let me stand next to you first.
(Yeon-soo is 160 cm)

327
00:14:33.816 --> 00:14:35.321
Soo-geun's definitely taller!

328
00:14:35.346 --> 00:14:36.580
(Feeling unsure)

329
00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:38.884
We can do it with shoes off,
I got nothing in my shoes.

330
00:14:38.909 --> 00:14:41.109
I got nothing in my shoes either!

331
00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:43.728
(A war over height between
the 2 shortest people)

332
00:14:44.888 --> 00:14:45.634
Wait!

333
00:14:46.474 --> 00:14:48.548
(Putting on the brakes)

334
00:14:49.761 --> 00:14:51.829
(His confidence level drops right before
the actual measuring)

335
00:14:51.854 --> 00:14:55.385
Don't stand next to each other yet,
but just walk past each other first.

336
00:14:56.033 --> 00:14:58.392
I look shorter with the backpack on,
can I take this off?

337
00:14:58.408 --> 00:15:00.008
I'll take it.

338
00:15:00.697 --> 00:15:02.751
(The moment of truth)

339
00:15:06.186 --> 00:15:07.603
(Tiptoe)

340
00:15:09.557 --> 00:15:11.470
(Come on, Jung-soo!)

341
00:15:11.516 --> 00:15:13.298
Jung-soo, just walk straight!

342
00:15:13.384 --> 00:15:15.321
You gotta change your
profile information then.

343
00:15:15.345 --> 00:15:17.532
I think you must be 167!

344
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:19.579
(Likes the idea)

345
00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:22.064
- I haven't really measured.
- Maybe you're still growing!

346
00:15:22.111 --> 00:15:23.711
Let's go for real.

347
00:15:25.145 --> 00:15:26.689
I always walk like this.

348
00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:32.665
Wait a minute, his hair is really poofy.

349
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:34.306
(That's not the reason!)

350
00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:37.548
Your hair's this tall by itself!

351
00:15:37.868 --> 00:15:39.532
Your hair's spiked up too!

352
00:15:39.758 --> 00:15:41.603
(Gets up quietly)

353
00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:44.360
Hey, let me see.

354
00:15:44.542 --> 00:15:46.485
What are you guys doing?

355
00:15:46.556 --> 00:15:48.289
(Gulliver in Lilliput.avi)

356
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:50.978
See?

357
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.720
Soo-geun's shoulder's higher too.

358
00:15:53.884 --> 00:15:57.806
Jung-soo! Then Jang-hoon's arms must be
longer than your legs, right?

359
00:15:58.314 --> 00:15:59.946
(Hm?)

360
00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:04.126
Jung-soo will be 2 inches taller if we
just loosen up his calves.

361
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:06.579
(His height is all hidden here)

362
00:16:06.781 --> 00:16:09.048
His legs are shorter than my arms?

363
00:16:09.852 --> 00:16:11.071
We can measure.

364
00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:13.165
I'm holding a fist.

365
00:16:15.243 --> 00:16:16.767
(Same height here)

366
00:16:16.798 --> 00:16:18.009
Jang-hoon's arm's longer!

367
00:16:18.048 --> 00:16:19.665
(Neither can believe it)

368
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.829
Jung-soo, then it's like you have 4 arms?

369
00:16:24.881 --> 00:16:28.212
It's like you're standing on your
hands right now.

370
00:16:29.048 --> 00:16:30.782
(This doesn't look strange at all)

371
00:16:30.814 --> 00:16:32.931
What am I, a desk?

372
00:16:34.319 --> 00:16:35.595
Study!

373
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.267
Bring us what your papers.

374
00:16:39.423 --> 00:16:42.368
- You do have a good body proportion.
- Thanks, Jung-soo.

375
00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:45.962
We have 3 people in the class today
who've been married and back?

376
00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:48.032
Wait, 4.

377
00:16:48.063 --> 00:16:49.863
The ratio's about the same.

378
00:16:50.228 --> 00:16:52.056
Him, him, him, and him.

379
00:16:52.119 --> 00:16:56.251
These 2 don't count, you can't put
amateurs in this mix.

380
00:16:56.689 --> 00:17:00.142
Why do you want to be "a professional"
this time?

381
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.946
(Strict requirements to join their league)

382
00:17:05.017 --> 00:17:06.684
I don't think it's right.

383
00:17:06.946 --> 00:17:09.470
Admission application,
name: Yoon Jung-soo.

384
00:17:09.525 --> 00:17:11.192
Nickname: Yoon Housewife.

385
00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:15.259
I like doing housekeeping work,
I've lived alone for a long time.

386
00:17:15.298 --> 00:17:16.884
He's really good at it.

387
00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:21.892
He's really clean, though he doesn't
look the part.

388
00:17:21.963 --> 00:17:23.853
Why do you say he doesn't look it?

389
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:28.610
He seems like he just likes to eat
and not clean.

390
00:17:28.744 --> 00:17:30.275
But he's really clean.

391
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.610
It doesn't fit you that you're
so clean either.

392
00:17:35.086 --> 00:17:36.071
(Quickly apologizes)

393
00:17:36.095 --> 00:17:37.695
I was surprised!

394
00:17:40.365 --> 00:17:42.431
(Jang-hoon learns something new
about himself today again)

395
00:17:42.509 --> 00:17:45.314
I am pretty clean, and I say so myself.

396
00:17:45.345 --> 00:17:49.360
I used to think that my house was
already clean, but I stood up on a chair

397
00:17:49.384 --> 00:17:50.853
and saw how dirty it was.

398
00:17:50.892 --> 00:17:53.665
There's dust everywhere above my head.

399
00:17:55.634 --> 00:17:57.234
I know what you mean.

400
00:17:57.377 --> 00:18:01.235
We can see Jung-soo's sincere heart
in this last determination he wrote.

401
00:18:01.345 --> 00:18:06.212
He said, "I'm gonna kick a few out
and sit in this classroom."

402
00:18:06.298 --> 00:18:08.962
- I don't really want Yeong-cheol's seat.
- Why not?

403
00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:11.571
Even if I sit there, I'll just end up
having everyone blame me.

404
00:18:11.603 --> 00:18:13.203
He's so wise!

405
00:18:14.111 --> 00:18:15.767
They don't even pay me sit here.

406
00:18:15.798 --> 00:18:18.704
- Really?
- Just kidding!

407
00:18:20.334 --> 00:18:24.314
But it seems like it's the easiest seat
for me to take.

408
00:18:24.407 --> 00:18:26.806
You'll be the first to get kicked out
for not being funny.

409
00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:31.118
Yeong-cheol, you should pay the network
to sit there and be in the show.

410
00:18:31.142 --> 00:18:32.571
(You think so?)

411
00:18:32.603 --> 00:18:35.118
You should be paying them
if you're gonna be that boring!

412
00:18:35.166 --> 00:18:36.462
It must be this seat!

413
00:18:36.517 --> 00:18:39.962
I heard there's a seat in this station
that you pay rent for!

414
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.642
Yes, it's like a school, you pay a monthly
fee to sit here and learn.

415
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:49.603
That's a great idea! Charge celebrities
for their seats.

416
00:18:49.642 --> 00:18:51.689
They take deposits and sell seats
to them.

417
00:18:51.736 --> 00:18:54.712
And I can have someone sublet
this seat?

418
00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:57.142
Good idea! With a security deposit.

419
00:18:57.181 --> 00:18:59.368
Now it's Yeon-soo's turn.

420
00:19:00.041 --> 00:19:02.423
Yeon-soo's nickname is "Kobugi,"
like a turtle.

421
00:19:02.463 --> 00:19:03.782
It fits you.

422
00:19:03.814 --> 00:19:05.595
She does look like a turtle.

423
00:19:05.658 --> 00:19:07.439
She looks like Yeri, too.

424
00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:10.212
Her flaw is that she looks a little
awkward, not clearly pretty.

425
00:19:10.236 --> 00:19:11.860
- Not at all!
- Really?

426
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.967
If her face is awkward, what about
our faces?

427
00:19:15.048 --> 00:19:16.728
"Our" faces?

428
00:19:19.676 --> 00:19:21.415
(I'm not your kind)

429
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.337
You think you're a little better-looking
in this crowd, right?

430
00:19:26.376 --> 00:19:29.103
I never thought I was actually bad-looking.

431
00:19:30.806 --> 00:19:32.406
Honestly speaking,

432
00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:34.525
these 2 are not like us, we all agree.

433
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.626
But what about you? Who do you
think you are?

434
00:19:36.767 --> 00:19:39.993
I'm not in your league for sure,
Jang-hoon and Ho-dong.

435
00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:42.985
Honestly, isn't Soo-geun a little more
like us instead?

436
00:19:43.277 --> 00:19:45.743
Let me take a look and see
who looks better.

437
00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:49.181
How about me sitting here?

438
00:19:49.228 --> 00:19:51.243
Your face isn't so bad, really.

439
00:19:51.283 --> 00:19:54.001
Your entire body makes you look
ugly though.

440
00:19:54.642 --> 00:19:56.923
You think you're any better?

441
00:19:58.226 --> 00:20:00.025
You look like a Boy Scout.

442
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.517
What's up with your pants?

443
00:20:01.564 --> 00:20:03.259
What about my pants?

444
00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:05.064
You look younger than before though.

445
00:20:05.089 --> 00:20:07.915
Your skin looks good. You look
the same from years ago.

446
00:20:09.618 --> 00:20:12.040
Short people don't get old that fast.

447
00:20:12.072 --> 00:20:13.735
It's an advantage we have.

448
00:20:13.783 --> 00:20:16.431
He's gotta have something at least
to survive.

449
00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:20.767
He does look really young.

450
00:20:21.794 --> 00:20:24.821
I felt like I was dying for a few years.

451
00:20:27.134 --> 00:20:30.532
Yeon-soo's got a very unique strength.

452
00:20:30.634 --> 00:20:33.642
She draws, but using her toes.

453
00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:35.603
No way!

454
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.931
There are people who can use their feet
like their hands.

455
00:20:38.986 --> 00:20:44.517
Jin from BTS opened a plastic bag
with his toes last time, too.

456
00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.821
Show us your skill, Yeon-soo.

457
00:20:49.686 --> 00:20:51.540
(At ease)

458
00:20:51.939 --> 00:20:55.298
Draw one of us, and we'll guess
who it is.

459
00:20:55.813 --> 00:20:56.517
OK.

460
00:20:56.541 --> 00:21:01.626
My arms are short, maybe I can replace
my arms with her legs.

461
00:21:01.814 --> 00:21:03.548
Yeon-soo lives a tough life.

462
00:21:03.642 --> 00:21:07.309
- You're keeping your socks on?
- Hey, it seems legit.

463
00:21:07.376 --> 00:21:09.579
I can tell it's Yeong-cheol
just from that.

464
00:21:09.619 --> 00:21:11.329
You're right!

465
00:21:12.035 --> 00:21:13.665
(Long face with Beethoven hair)

466
00:21:13.912 --> 00:21:16.173
(Looking 100% same!)

467
00:21:16.465 --> 00:21:18.743
(She can draw quickly and stably,
as if she's drawing with her hand)

468
00:21:18.806 --> 00:21:20.907
She's picking out characters quickly,
like a "creature."

469
00:21:20.986 --> 00:21:22.586
"Creature"?

470
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:25.345
What are you, talking about an alien?

471
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.829
(Caricature...)

472
00:21:27.385 --> 00:21:31.360
(Her drawing gets more and more complete
as crowd around her talks)

473
00:21:34.439 --> 00:21:36.290
It's me, right? It looks just like me.

474
00:21:36.345 --> 00:21:37.860
Looks a little cooler than you.

475
00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:40.256
Let me draw with my hand this time.

476
00:21:40.306 --> 00:21:41.548
OK, with your hand this time!

477
00:21:41.595 --> 00:21:44.485
Let's see how good she is with her hand.

478
00:21:44.611 --> 00:21:46.689
(Focused)

479
00:21:47.443 --> 00:21:49.126
(Quickly)

480
00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:52.243
- Wow, she's really good!
- And she's fast!

481
00:21:54.613 --> 00:21:56.962
(She's already done with an outline)

482
00:22:00.839 --> 00:22:03.689
(They're amazed at how well she draws)

483
00:22:06.055 --> 00:22:08.142
(Done already!)

484
00:22:09.139 --> 00:22:10.939
(Looks just like him!)

485
00:22:11.203 --> 00:22:13.196
Looks like a Communist.

486
00:22:15.861 --> 00:22:17.461
Or Swings, the rapper!

487
00:22:17.509 --> 00:22:19.157
Here, insert a...

488
00:22:19.998 --> 00:22:21.598
(Draw a star here!)

489
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:23.603
(She fixes her drawing
at their fervent request)

490
00:22:23.666 --> 00:22:26.439
He looks like a Chinese soldier who fought
at the Korean War!

491
00:22:26.477 --> 00:22:28.431
(And he looks just like Ho-dong)

492
00:22:28.509 --> 00:22:30.109
(Inserting a small star)

493
00:22:31.856 --> 00:22:33.079
She's good!

494
00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.275
(With detailed finishing touches)

495
00:22:37.017 --> 00:22:39.134
She can draw like a cartoonist.

496
00:22:39.345 --> 00:22:41.259
(They look the same)

497
00:22:41.673 --> 00:22:43.525
Thanks!

498
00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:49.540
I'll give you a very personal quiz
about myself.

499
00:22:49.611 --> 00:22:51.071
We like personal questions.

500
00:22:51.111 --> 00:22:53.665
Jung-soo, try hard to get these too.

501
00:22:53.837 --> 00:22:54.728
OK.

502
00:22:54.744 --> 00:22:59.025
If you single me out like that,
I might misunderstand your intention.

503
00:23:00.948 --> 00:23:02.673
What's wrong with you?

504
00:23:03.196 --> 00:23:05.642
Isn't that true? She singled me out.

505
00:23:07.822 --> 00:23:11.032
It's a very personal question starting
with the first one.

506
00:23:11.063 --> 00:23:12.470
Hope you get it.

507
00:23:12.494 --> 00:23:14.294
I'll get all of them right.

508
00:23:14.345 --> 00:23:17.712
I was so upset after my first love
said he wanted to break up with me.

509
00:23:17.759 --> 00:23:21.423
So I gave him a condition, "If you do
these things then I agree to break up."

510
00:23:21.463 --> 00:23:24.071
What do you think I said?
I was 20.

511
00:23:24.189 --> 00:23:25.321
8 years Ag.

512
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.525
Just keep dating me for one more month.

513
00:23:29.798 --> 00:23:34.939
If you still want to break up after
we date another month, then it's over.

514
00:23:34.978 --> 00:23:36.392
"See you after 4 weeks!"

515
00:23:37.228 --> 00:23:41.751
"I'll kill you if you date someone
younger than me."

516
00:23:41.892 --> 00:23:43.321
(What was that?)

517
00:23:44.322 --> 00:23:47.907
How long did you guys go out for
before he broke up with you?

518
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.392
A month.

519
00:23:49.408 --> 00:23:50.509
Just a month?

520
00:23:50.556 --> 00:23:52.532
Yeon-soo must've done something wrong.

521
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.079
Were you caught stealing something?

522
00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:55.978
No, nothing like that!

523
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.165
If it's not something bad like that,
why after a month?

524
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:01.048
(They're making up stories again)

525
00:24:01.088 --> 00:24:03.751
"I agree to breaking up if you don't
tell anyone that I stole."

526
00:24:03.782 --> 00:24:07.353
"Just give me another month, I'll return
everything I stole from you."

527
00:24:09.103 --> 00:24:11.493
"Throw up all the food we ate together."

528
00:24:11.509 --> 00:24:14.306
(She brings out the hammer
without saying anything)

529
00:24:14.322 --> 00:24:17.306
I hope you throw up after
getting hit by this.

530
00:24:21.048 --> 00:24:22.376
(Crash!)

531
00:24:22.423 --> 00:24:24.023
This is a new method!

532
00:24:24.712 --> 00:24:26.312
I did not expect that.

533
00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:28.894
I didn't think she'd hit me like that.

534
00:24:29.103 --> 00:24:32.009
Now you're doing slap-stick comedy?

535
00:24:33.267 --> 00:24:35.110
I just didn't expect it.

536
00:24:35.267 --> 00:24:38.720
I'm curious, did you guys end up
breaking up after doing that?

537
00:24:38.805 --> 00:24:40.405
We did.

538
00:24:41.173 --> 00:24:43.673
I agree to break up if you give me
200,000 dollars.

539
00:24:43.744 --> 00:24:46.095
(Quietly walking up again)

540
00:24:48.461 --> 00:24:50.290
She hit my ear!

541
00:24:50.377 --> 00:24:52.009
That's why he broke up with you!

542
00:24:54.385 --> 00:24:56.267
Because he was scared of you.

543
00:24:56.322 --> 00:24:58.655
It's something he had to do for me.

544
00:24:58.908 --> 00:24:59.814
Guess.

545
00:24:59.869 --> 00:25:02.915
In a crowded public place, like a plaza...

546
00:25:02.947 --> 00:25:03.743
(Surprised)

547
00:25:03.775 --> 00:25:05.220
Must be close.

548
00:25:05.259 --> 00:25:11.743
You asked him to yell really loudly,
"Yeon-soo, I love you!"

549
00:25:11.822 --> 00:25:14.298
No, but it's true that it involved
a crowded place.

550
00:25:14.392 --> 00:25:15.439
A famous dating spot.

551
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:16.681
At a park...

552
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.087
It was in Seoul.

553
00:25:19.306 --> 00:25:22.525
"Buy me a pork cutlet in Namsan!"

554
00:25:22.892 --> 00:25:24.970
The location is correct.

555
00:25:25.275 --> 00:25:27.118
You know those steps in Namsan?

556
00:25:27.134 --> 00:25:30.368
"If we play rock-paper-scissors and you
climb up the steps faster, I agree."

557
00:25:30.439 --> 00:25:33.009
A similar feel, but completely different
condition.

558
00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:35.610
You had a lock of love in Namsan
while you were dating.

559
00:25:35.627 --> 00:25:36.439
No, we didn't.

560
00:25:36.486 --> 00:25:37.946
"If you find it and open it,
we'll break up."

561
00:25:37.978 --> 00:25:39.578
No, no lock.

562
00:25:39.853 --> 00:25:41.423
Jang-hoon was the closest so far.

563
00:25:41.494 --> 00:25:44.095
Yeah, I'm always the closest one
before getting it wrong.

564
00:25:44.197 --> 00:25:46.329
Not a game, he had to do something.

565
00:25:46.399 --> 00:25:49.937
"I'll let you break up with me if you carry
me all the way up the steps in Namsan."

566
00:25:49.963 --> 00:25:51.446
Correct!

567
00:25:52.002 --> 00:25:54.962
(Seo Jang-hoon gets it right!)

568
00:25:57.141 --> 00:25:59.939
It is amazing that he got it right,
but why'd you do that?

569
00:25:59.955 --> 00:26:01.579
Don't you have any pride?

570
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.250
I didn't then.

571
00:26:03.509 --> 00:26:05.040
Get up!

572
00:26:05.072 --> 00:26:06.672
And applaud!

573
00:26:06.673 --> 00:26:08.407
(Praise him!)

574
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:13.142
He got the answer, but did the boyfriend
really do that?

575
00:26:13.166 --> 00:26:14.360
Or did he quit?

576
00:26:14.392 --> 00:26:16.095
I'm sure he didn't actually do it.

577
00:26:16.134 --> 00:26:18.157
He did carry me up all the way to the top.

578
00:26:18.182 --> 00:26:21.353
He must've really wanted to
break up with you!

579
00:26:21.455 --> 00:26:26.032
You must've cried so hard when he
reached the top with you on his back.

580
00:26:26.064 --> 00:26:28.618
I started crying as soon as I got
on his back.

581
00:26:28.665 --> 00:26:30.860
(Heartbroken)

582
00:26:33.093 --> 00:26:34.884
I'm sure his back was soaked.

583
00:26:35.692 --> 00:26:37.587
No, let's not act it out.

584
00:26:38.731 --> 00:26:42.150
He was so mean too, he knew
that you were crying so hard.

585
00:26:42.205 --> 00:26:44.282
You should've tripped him.

586
00:26:44.322 --> 00:26:45.642
And make him fall.

587
00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.017
Both will fall then.

588
00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:47.946
True.

589
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.384
You should've just told him to get lost
and kick him when

590
00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:51.595
he was about to carry you.

591
00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.025
He was my first love!

592
00:26:53.064 --> 00:26:55.079
Those steps must have felt so short
for you.

593
00:26:55.095 --> 00:26:56.400
Yes, that's true.

594
00:26:56.446 --> 00:26:59.845
The one who's more in love is always
like a sinner.

595
00:26:59.861 --> 00:27:01.337
What a nice phrase!

596
00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:03.290
I loved many people before.

597
00:27:04.025 --> 00:27:06.001
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Why not?

598
00:27:06.056 --> 00:27:08.360
I don't know, I just think so.

599
00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:11.720
It's a life sentence for me if a lover
is a sinner.

600
00:27:11.759 --> 00:27:13.181
(Punishment for loving someone)

601
00:27:13.228 --> 00:27:17.806
So we got to the top, and now we had to
go back down, while I was still crying.

602
00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.743
And we walked down those steps together,
as I was bawling.

603
00:27:21.798 --> 00:27:26.009
I was crying so hard, and he said something
to me on our way down.

604
00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:30.782
"I'll take you back if you still like me
the same after a few years."

605
00:27:31.337 --> 00:27:33.970
- Ridiculous!
- It's like a dog barking.

606
00:27:34.743 --> 00:27:36.758
"That makes no sense, you bastard!"

607
00:27:37.134 --> 00:27:40.368
You're getting completely different types
of responses than other places, right?

608
00:27:40.728 --> 00:27:42.110
I'm taken aback.

609
00:27:42.142 --> 00:27:43.742
We're like her dad.

610
00:27:44.463 --> 00:27:48.056
We're being completely honest,
it's a totally ridiculous thing to say.

611
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.251
It's just crap, what he said.

612
00:27:50.798 --> 00:27:52.673
Then I called him.

613
00:27:52.698 --> 00:27:54.337
No!

614
00:27:54.463 --> 00:27:55.931
Because you still liked him?

615
00:27:55.955 --> 00:27:57.907
I continued to like him.

616
00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.602
- We met up, but...
- You were a bit clingy, don't you think?

617
00:28:03.041 --> 00:28:04.641
We did meet up.

618
00:28:05.173 --> 00:28:08.446
We met once, then another, then another.

619
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.134
And we dated each other again.

620
00:28:12.673 --> 00:28:13.900
And we dated each other again.

621
00:28:13.947 --> 00:28:15.478
(No way!)

622
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.860
- Then you broke up again?
- Yeah.

623
00:28:16.885 --> 00:28:18.915
See how meaningless it was?

624
00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.790
What did you like so much about him?

625
00:28:20.845 --> 00:28:23.610
He was so opposite from me,
and I was attracted to that.

626
00:28:23.705 --> 00:28:25.305
Opposite in what way?

627
00:28:25.579 --> 00:28:27.110
Our personalities.

628
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:27.900
Our preferences.

629
00:28:27.923 --> 00:28:31.723
Did you ask him to carry you up a
ski resort this time?

630
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.806
No, we just agreed to break up.

631
00:28:36.142 --> 00:28:38.564
He's an expert on agreeing to break up.

632
00:28:40.237 --> 00:28:41.954
Bring in the camera!

633
00:28:44.636 --> 00:28:47.673
(Our expert on agreeing to break up)

634
00:28:47.775 --> 00:28:49.575
It went smoothly this time.

635
00:28:49.767 --> 00:28:51.657
Who broke up with whom this time?

636
00:28:51.712 --> 00:28:53.312
I did.

637
00:28:53.618 --> 00:28:54.829
Why?

638
00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.798
It seemed like he didn't love me anymore.

639
00:28:57.877 --> 00:28:59.462
What made you come to that decision?

640
00:28:59.478 --> 00:29:02.657
His facial expressions, how he talked to
me, his actions...

641
00:29:02.728 --> 00:29:05.431
Why'd you ask him to carry you up
to Namsan?

642
00:29:05.494 --> 00:29:07.860
I've actually never been to Namsan.

643
00:29:07.892 --> 00:29:09.993
I thought it was this huge mountain.

644
00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:12.275
I thought it'll take like 3 hours to go
back and forth.

645
00:29:12.306 --> 00:29:14.478
Oh, you thought it'd be impossible
for him to do that.

646
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:15.712
Where did you grow up that you've
never been to Namsan?

647
00:29:15.728 --> 00:29:17.525
Busan.

648
00:29:18.353 --> 00:29:20.228
You have no accent at all!

649
00:29:20.345 --> 00:29:21.314
I can!

650
00:29:21.361 --> 00:29:22.267
Show us.

651
00:29:22.322 --> 00:29:23.571
I am right now.

652
00:29:23.634 --> 00:29:25.595
(She's still got it!)

653
00:29:27.048 --> 00:29:30.181
- You're from Haeundae?
- Yes, how'd you know?

654
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.320
I just guessed.

655
00:29:32.442 --> 00:29:34.478
(She thought he knew something)

656
00:29:35.002 --> 00:29:38.743
He only knows Haeundae and Gwangalli
in Busan.

657
00:29:39.947 --> 00:29:42.775
(He finds it amazing too)

658
00:29:43.127 --> 00:29:44.282
Haeundae is a big region.

659
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.009
Give us the next question.

660
00:29:46.033 --> 00:29:47.478
OK, just wait.

661
00:29:47.517 --> 00:29:49.150
Her accent's so cute!

662
00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:52.314
How long did you live there? From your
voice, it must've been at least until

663
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.329
you were a senior in high school.

664
00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:55.603
You're totally right!

665
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:56.485
Completely accurate.

666
00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.907
- You came to Seoul when you were 20?
- You're right!

667
00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:01.837
Then you met that boyfriend as soon
as you came to Seoul?

668
00:30:01.923 --> 00:30:03.314
Pretty much, yeah.

669
00:30:03.338 --> 00:30:05.485
You liked his soft Seoul accent?

670
00:30:05.556 --> 00:30:07.156
Yeah!

671
00:30:07.455 --> 00:30:09.454
"Yeon-soo, did you eat yet?"

672
00:30:09.502 --> 00:30:11.485
(Impressed by his Seoul accent)

673
00:30:11.744 --> 00:30:13.344
(Getting crazy)

674
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:14.290
(Now stern)

675
00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:18.329
Was he better looking than me?

676
00:30:18.369 --> 00:30:19.181
Yes!

677
00:30:20.267 --> 00:30:21.603
(Not feeling good)

678
00:30:21.728 --> 00:30:23.173
Why would you ask that?

679
00:30:23.213 --> 00:30:23.970
Of course he was.

680
00:30:24.002 --> 00:30:25.501
More charming than me?

681
00:30:25.556 --> 00:30:27.298
His skin tone was similar to yours.

682
00:30:27.908 --> 00:30:30.673
There's gotta be nothing similar that she
had to compare skin tones.

683
00:30:32.373 --> 00:30:34.610
At least the eyes or the nose!

684
00:30:34.627 --> 00:30:37.696
Where can you ever find someone
who's like Ho-dong?

685
00:30:37.736 --> 00:30:39.478
(The one and only!)

686
00:30:40.642 --> 00:30:43.400
Now this is about my next boyfriend.

687
00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:44.915
The next one.

688
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.314
So after this boyfriend and I broke up,

689
00:30:48.392 --> 00:30:51.275
I even did this to try to
win his heart again.

690
00:30:52.064 --> 00:30:54.134
You put a mole on your face
with a marker.

691
00:30:54.411 --> 00:30:56.071
To pretend to be a different person.

692
00:30:56.842 --> 00:30:59.056
(Wrong answer)

693
00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:01.587
It'll have to be a really big mole.

694
00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:06.368
You figured out where he goes
in his daily life.

695
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:08.243
You kept making yourself to run into him
in his route.

696
00:31:08.268 --> 00:31:09.735
Making it seem like coincidence.

697
00:31:09.759 --> 00:31:11.509
It's a little similar.

698
00:31:12.213 --> 00:31:13.626
Like you ran into him on coincidence?

699
00:31:13.651 --> 00:31:15.752
That's the worst! No one should do that.

700
00:31:15.783 --> 00:31:17.235
You drank and...

701
00:31:17.283 --> 00:31:19.845
No one should do that, it's the worst
of being clingy.

702
00:31:19.884 --> 00:31:21.548
- You drank...
- I really don't think...

703
00:31:21.595 --> 00:31:24.017
OK, stop it, Jang-hoon!

704
00:31:24.056 --> 00:31:25.704
You're the worst of the clingy type!

705
00:31:25.729 --> 00:31:26.853
Let him talk for once!

706
00:31:26.884 --> 00:31:29.290
Sorry, but it's just so bad.

707
00:31:29.415 --> 00:31:31.509
What's so terrible about it?

708
00:31:31.587 --> 00:31:34.735
I think it's just so terrible to plant
yourself to "run into him"

709
00:31:34.752 --> 00:31:38.220
by figuring out where he'd go next.

710
00:31:38.322 --> 00:31:40.720
I really hate that idea, no one should
do that.

711
00:31:40.752 --> 00:31:43.181
What you're saying is right, but
think about how desperate she was.

712
00:31:43.228 --> 00:31:46.751
I understand the desperation,
but it doesn't help, so don't.

713
00:31:48.397 --> 00:31:50.189
Was he always this much of an expert
in dating?

714
00:31:50.227 --> 00:31:52.173
I'm a little surprised myself.

715
00:31:52.737 --> 00:31:56.728
Nothing like that, but it's just
the worst thing to do.

716
00:31:57.056 --> 00:32:00.282
No. Let me elaborate.

717
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.525
(Kyung-hoon loses his chance again)

718
00:32:02.564 --> 00:32:04.603
I called him and told him,
then I went there.

719
00:32:04.627 --> 00:32:07.845
You drank everyday and went to
go see him everyday.

720
00:32:07.877 --> 00:32:08.282
No.

721
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:09.595
She can't drink.

722
00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.213
No, I drink about 2 and a half bottles
of soju.

723
00:32:11.448 --> 00:32:12.806
(Jaw-dropping)

724
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.923
But that's not what's important!

725
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.313
It's very important to us!

726
00:32:18.968 --> 00:32:20.837
This was the funniest moment today.

727
00:32:20.883 --> 00:32:22.743
"No, 2 and a half bottles of soju for me."

728
00:32:22.768 --> 00:32:25.901
You can see that she didn't have
a typical life in the past.

729
00:32:25.994 --> 00:32:28.259
You put yourself in a delivery box.

730
00:32:28.353 --> 00:32:30.321
You went to him with a turtle mask.

731
00:32:30.384 --> 00:32:31.984
Similar.

732
00:32:32.212 --> 00:32:35.423
You put on the life-size body suit
you see in amusement parks.

733
00:32:35.478 --> 00:32:37.078
Very similar.

734
00:32:37.447 --> 00:32:42.259
You pretended to deliver flowers
then opened your helmet.

735
00:32:43.048 --> 00:32:45.017
The doll mask is right.

736
00:32:45.158 --> 00:32:46.751
It was a cat mask.

737
00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:49.806
I regretted telling him that we should
break up.

738
00:32:49.838 --> 00:32:51.970
And I did this to take it back.

739
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:53.954
So it was a gesture to make up.

740
00:32:54.002 --> 00:32:56.806
So you put on a Hahoe mask [pun]
and pretended to be a famous comedian.

741
00:33:00.785 --> 00:33:02.454
(Of course not!)

742
00:33:02.908 --> 00:33:04.900
She has to know how to act like him then.

743
00:33:05.119 --> 00:33:09.665
You were waiting for him at his bus stop
or a subway stop,

744
00:33:09.697 --> 00:33:12.579
and you stood next to him wearing
the big mask.

745
00:33:13.343 --> 00:33:15.821
That's so cute, I should've done that.

746
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:17.469
How's that cute?

747
00:33:18.642 --> 00:33:21.064
You waited for him in front of his house
with the mask on!

748
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:23.470
(Yeong-cheol gets it right!)

749
00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:28.860
I put on this whole body suit of a cat,
but couldn't fit in a taxi.

750
00:33:28.908 --> 00:33:31.829
- The head was too big.
- The taxi driver let you?

751
00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:33.540
Yeah, he did.

752
00:33:33.548 --> 00:33:37.321
The taxi driver helped me take out
the head piece, so I got in.

753
00:33:37.377 --> 00:33:40.689
Now I had to get off and he helped me
put back the head piece again.

754
00:33:40.743 --> 00:33:47.251
And I had to pay, but because of the huge
glove, I couldn't pull out my card.

755
00:33:47.259 --> 00:33:48.985
Her life's like a sitcom.

756
00:33:49.119 --> 00:33:52.681
Anyhow, I put back the costume, and
there was a kindergarten in front of

757
00:33:52.706 --> 00:33:54.087
his house.

758
00:33:54.112 --> 00:33:57.142
So all these kids were pointing
at me, wanting to play.

759
00:33:57.189 --> 00:33:59.860
It's like going to a bee house
covered in honey.

760
00:33:59.877 --> 00:34:02.478
- Then?
- Then I waited for him with flowers.

761
00:34:02.548 --> 00:34:03.782
What'd he say?

762
00:34:04.361 --> 00:34:06.561
He sighed, like a sigh of relief.

763
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.845
Your mind told you to put on
a body suit of a cat?

764
00:34:09.876 --> 00:34:10.689
Yes.

765
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.782
(Signal received)

766
00:34:11.822 --> 00:34:14.509
Why'd you break up again after
working to hard to get back together?

767
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.413
Difference in personality.

768
00:34:19.091 --> 00:34:20.900
(Looks at him again)

769
00:34:20.939 --> 00:34:22.900
Stop looking at me!

770
00:34:24.314 --> 00:34:25.837
Everyone's got a different personality.

771
00:34:26.369 --> 00:34:27.353
That's true.

772
00:34:27.377 --> 00:34:29.977
Just like there's difference in height.

773
00:34:30.095 --> 00:34:34.282
What do you guys do if someone wants
to break up with you but you don't?

774
00:34:34.353 --> 00:34:37.978
You can't hold on to a person's heart
once the person already leaves.

775
00:34:38.064 --> 00:34:40.095
You guys never asked to reconsider?

776
00:34:40.173 --> 00:34:42.603
Yeong-cheol never dated
to begin with.

777
00:34:42.628 --> 00:34:45.329
(Official dating record is unknown)

778
00:34:45.627 --> 00:34:47.150
(He feels like he won somehow)

779
00:34:47.173 --> 00:34:48.009
Is that true though?

780
00:34:48.041 --> 00:34:50.040
He said he's never kissed before.

781
00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:51.618
Really?

782
00:34:51.643 --> 00:34:53.009
(He's now given up)

783
00:34:53.048 --> 00:34:54.759
He was going to kiss, but he got slapped.

784
00:34:54.783 --> 00:34:55.610
She hit me.

785
00:34:55.642 --> 00:34:56.681
(How sad...)

786
00:35:00.281 --> 00:35:02.103
It was with a foreigner?

787
00:35:08.024 --> 00:35:11.806
Anyway, I hope you find your true love.

788
00:35:11.884 --> 00:35:13.853
Maybe one of you might date me.

789
00:35:13.892 --> 00:35:14.829
- That's true.
- Yes.

790
00:35:14.854 --> 00:35:17.087
- I have a chance too?
- Yes, of course!

791
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.915
- I have a chance too?
- Yes, of course!

792
00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.118
- Really?
- Yes.

793
00:35:20.259 --> 00:35:22.079
I know, I'm so popular.

794
00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:24.298
It's OK if someone's a lot older?

795
00:35:24.648 --> 00:35:26.056
(Is it OK if I don't answer?)

796
00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:29.204
He was just saying not to get clingy!

797
00:35:29.423 --> 00:35:31.634
I don't think Yeon-soo cares that much
about age difference.

798
00:35:31.689 --> 00:35:32.548
He's right.

799
00:35:32.588 --> 00:35:34.642
What's the acceptable range
of age difference?

800
00:35:34.658 --> 00:35:36.782
Well, can't be a minor.

801
00:35:38.016 --> 00:35:38.837
How about older?

802
00:35:38.853 --> 00:35:41.618
As long as someone doesn't feel
like my dad.

803
00:35:41.696 --> 00:35:43.376
What kind of a personality do you like?

804
00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:45.860
Someone responsible.

805
00:35:46.345 --> 00:35:48.509
Someone who's kind and gentle.

806
00:35:48.658 --> 00:35:51.392
And someone who takes care of
his own business.

807
00:35:51.439 --> 00:35:53.039
That's totally me then.

808
00:35:53.205 --> 00:35:55.353
Nothing about the looks?

809
00:35:55.377 --> 00:35:56.548
How about the out-appearances?

810
00:35:56.595 --> 00:36:00.337
Just someone... With the same vibe
when he's with me.

811
00:36:00.408 --> 00:36:03.095
What kind of a vibe is that?

812
00:36:03.213 --> 00:36:05.720
She's saying, "Someone not ugly."

813
00:36:05.745 --> 00:36:07.696
Why go around in circles?

814
00:36:09.009 --> 00:36:13.634
How can I do that? How can I not be ugly?

815
00:36:14.876 --> 00:36:17.392
She's saying, "I hope he's decent-looking."

816
00:36:17.423 --> 00:36:19.548
Someone I can kiss.

817
00:36:20.754 --> 00:36:25.032
Tell us your limit among us
for you to kiss.

818
00:36:25.057 --> 00:36:26.478
It's too cruel.

819
00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:29.298
How many people here you think
you just can't kiss?

820
00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:30.353
How many?

821
00:36:31.094 --> 00:36:33.720
Let's say everyone's the same age.

822
00:36:34.629 --> 00:36:36.118
(OK, got it)

823
00:36:36.157 --> 00:36:38.103
And no one's married.

824
00:36:38.737 --> 00:36:40.431
Don't move, don't move!

825
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.462
Don't mention any names.

826
00:36:43.509 --> 00:36:45.173
Just how many?

827
00:36:46.626 --> 00:36:48.603
I think I can kiss maybe 6 from here.

828
00:36:48.642 --> 00:36:50.243
(He's counting how many total)

829
00:36:50.306 --> 00:36:53.884
(Who are the 2 that are just impossible
for her to kiss?)

830
00:36:55.165 --> 00:36:57.517
I would've been sad if it was just one.

831
00:36:57.563 --> 00:36:59.056
I feel like I'm on the line.

832
00:37:00.705 --> 00:37:02.626
I really want to know which two.

833
00:37:02.673 --> 00:37:04.384
One on each side?

834
00:37:04.486 --> 00:37:05.743
Yes.

835
00:37:06.098 --> 00:37:08.329
(One in each side!)

836
00:37:10.498 --> 00:37:13.064
Let's reveal it for our side.

837
00:37:13.282 --> 00:37:14.720
(All agree?)

838
00:37:14.838 --> 00:37:17.720
I don't want to!

839
00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.462
No, I won't say it!

840
00:37:22.729 --> 00:37:24.657
I think it has to be Ho-dong then.

841
00:37:26.945 --> 00:37:27.868
(Unsure what to do)

842
00:37:27.962 --> 00:37:29.376
She said she likes Ho-dong.

843
00:37:29.377 --> 00:37:31.564
What color of clothing?
Milk or chocolate?

844
00:37:32.197 --> 00:37:34.478
What color of clothing?
Milk or chocolate?

845
00:37:35.079 --> 00:37:37.289
How about initials for color? M? C?

846
00:37:37.329 --> 00:37:39.610
Sometimes it's better not to know.

847
00:37:39.783 --> 00:37:41.509
- Let's not find out.
- I agree.

848
00:37:41.548 --> 00:37:42.782
It doesn't feel resolved.

849
00:37:42.822 --> 00:37:44.564
I feel the same.

850
00:37:45.649 --> 00:37:47.876
Can I go on to my next problem?

851
00:37:47.939 --> 00:37:50.157
I think you're the problem.

852
00:37:51.915 --> 00:37:54.017
Yes! Jung-soo, you're absolutely right.

853
00:37:54.064 --> 00:37:55.501
This time, I was the problem.

854
00:37:55.525 --> 00:37:57.192
- Really?
- Yeah, I was.

855
00:37:57.963 --> 00:37:59.282
Hope you get it right.

856
00:37:59.994 --> 00:38:01.660
(She's definitely unique)

857
00:38:03.236 --> 00:38:04.603
When I was little...

858
00:38:04.633 --> 00:38:09.782
Someone stopped me and said that
there was a bad vibe or energy around me.

859
00:38:09.822 --> 00:38:12.829
So I followed him, and I said something.

860
00:38:12.861 --> 00:38:15.337
What do you think I said?

861
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:17.954
"Carry me there!"

862
00:38:19.665 --> 00:38:21.587
"Can I live here?"

863
00:38:23.048 --> 00:38:25.431
"Do you provide food and lodging?"

864
00:38:26.368 --> 00:38:28.189
(Wrong answer, Jang-hoon)

865
00:38:28.251 --> 00:38:29.930
"What a liar!"

866
00:38:31.541 --> 00:38:34.126
"You all want to be arrested
by the police?"

867
00:38:34.275 --> 00:38:35.875
It's very close.

868
00:38:36.056 --> 00:38:39.181
"I'm gonna call the cops if you don't
let me go right away!"

869
00:38:39.588 --> 00:38:41.188
That's right.

870
00:38:42.291 --> 00:38:43.853
Jang-hoon got so good at this.

871
00:38:43.908 --> 00:38:45.689
I feel embarrassed that I get it
right all the time now.

872
00:38:45.744 --> 00:38:47.665
I thought of it, but thought it was
too obvious.

873
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.509
Sorry that I keep getting
all the right answers.

874
00:38:50.541 --> 00:38:52.431
Then you shouldn't have.

875
00:38:52.813 --> 00:38:54.290
If you knew you were right.

876
00:38:54.337 --> 00:38:56.665
You went there but you wanted
to call the cops?

877
00:38:56.713 --> 00:38:59.040
They said it was a meditation facility.

878
00:38:59.072 --> 00:39:03.532
I wanted to see what they would tell me,
like they'd prescribe something for me.

879
00:39:03.572 --> 00:39:06.907
But they just told me to get into
an empty room.

880
00:39:06.955 --> 00:39:10.970
Then they told me to pray standing up
for 50 minutes.

881
00:39:11.142 --> 00:39:13.384
I was so appalled.

882
00:39:13.409 --> 00:39:16.110
I told them I'm gonna call the cops
on all of them.

883
00:39:16.158 --> 00:39:18.306
"What is this place?"

884
00:39:18.423 --> 00:39:19.720
Did you call the cops?

885
00:39:19.767 --> 00:39:23.915
I did dial, but they try to take away
my phone and stopped me.

886
00:39:24.322 --> 00:39:27.720
- Then they let you go right then?
- Yes, right away.

887
00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:30.829
You were much stronger than
they thought, I'm sure.

888
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.712
I was a little scared, to be honest.

889
00:39:32.752 --> 00:39:35.517
I had to walk down on my own,
I was scared they might chase me.

890
00:39:35.548 --> 00:39:37.415
But not when you were going in?

891
00:39:38.697 --> 00:39:42.923
I was confident that nothing bad
would happen to me.

892
00:39:43.048 --> 00:39:46.571
And the person who approached me was
a girl, so I was curious.

893
00:39:46.666 --> 00:39:50.712
- She was younger than me.
- Someone younger than you took you there?

894
00:39:50.845 --> 00:39:54.673
On top of that, she had pink shoes,
pink jacket, and pink scarf.

895
00:39:54.744 --> 00:39:56.618
Hey, that's me!

896
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:57.673
Let me try to remember.

897
00:39:57.705 --> 00:39:58.829
I was 20.

898
00:39:58.861 --> 00:40:01.470
Hey it's gotta be around the same time...

899
00:40:01.509 --> 00:40:02.587
You should be careful.

900
00:40:02.634 --> 00:40:04.626
- It can get dangerous.
- Don't follow strangers.

901
00:40:04.681 --> 00:40:06.681
Many things happened to you
when you were 20.

902
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.095
She must've been very curious about
Seoul.

903
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.860
Yes, I was very curious.

904
00:40:10.963 --> 00:40:12.095
It's that age.

905
00:40:12.165 --> 00:40:16.432
What do you guys do when you're
really curious about something?

906
00:40:16.509 --> 00:40:18.251
I don't get so curious.

907
00:40:18.392 --> 00:40:21.103
Aren't you curious about buildings
and real estate?

908
00:40:21.142 --> 00:40:22.970
Not really, actually.

909
00:40:22.995 --> 00:40:25.321
He's already got all that he wants,
and he's done it all.

910
00:40:25.352 --> 00:40:28.039
More than what I have or done...

911
00:40:28.634 --> 00:40:32.571
I just stay still, I don't really have
anything I'm curious about.

912
00:40:32.627 --> 00:40:34.314
How about you, Jung-soo?

913
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.954
I have no interest in things outside
of my field.

914
00:40:37.095 --> 00:40:39.095
- We're the same way.
- Most people are like that.

915
00:40:39.158 --> 00:40:42.251
I'm interested in things like, "Hey,
there are 4 women drinking,

916
00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.906
wanna join them?"

917
00:40:44.462 --> 00:40:46.782
- He does have an interest in dating.
- Yes.

918
00:40:46.838 --> 00:40:48.806
It's not wrong for me to have an interest
in women.

919
00:40:48.853 --> 00:40:50.243
Of course not.

920
00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:52.634
If I can reveal the person in this line,

921
00:40:52.705 --> 00:40:54.838
it's Jung-soo whom I won't kiss.

922
00:40:58.798 --> 00:41:00.634
What are you doing?

923
00:41:01.497 --> 00:41:03.540
(Runs away)

924
00:41:03.649 --> 00:41:05.024
(The giant saw something)

925
00:41:05.048 --> 00:41:08.642
I saw Ho-dong's face as soon
as she said that.

926
00:41:08.814 --> 00:41:10.564
He's got a huge smile on his face!

927
00:41:12.202 --> 00:41:14.335
It's Jung-soo whom I won't kiss.

928
00:41:14.649 --> 00:41:16.249
(First relieved)

929
00:41:17.002 --> 00:41:20.220
(Then a huge smile across his face)

930
00:41:21.755 --> 00:41:23.493
(And embarrassed after)

931
00:41:23.936 --> 00:41:24.962
(He's still burning with anger)

932
00:41:25.017 --> 00:41:26.814
Did I ever ask you to date me?

933
00:41:27.129 --> 00:41:29.165
(She keeps running away)

934
00:41:30.111 --> 00:41:32.056
Did I ever ask you to go out with me?

935
00:41:32.118 --> 00:41:34.181
(Sorry, sorry!)

936
00:41:34.662 --> 00:41:36.751
(Makes me mad to think about it)

937
00:41:36.783 --> 00:41:38.650
How about this side! Who is it?

938
00:41:38.689 --> 00:41:39.704
What about this side?

939
00:41:39.729 --> 00:41:41.642
Reveal it for this side too!

940
00:41:41.705 --> 00:41:43.431
Don't do it!

941
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:44.735
(There seems to be an understanding)

942
00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.071
It's not necessary, don't do it.

943
00:41:46.127 --> 00:41:47.368
Is it him at the end?

944
00:41:48.448 --> 00:41:50.509
Yeah, that's right.

945
00:41:50.611 --> 00:41:52.360
She didn't say anything.

946
00:41:52.736 --> 00:41:54.485
Look at her response!

947
00:41:55.238 --> 00:41:57.001
(Trying to stay calm)

948
00:41:57.444 --> 00:41:58.579
She's cute.

949
00:41:58.619 --> 00:42:01.017
I don't want to hear her questions
anymore.

950
00:42:01.063 --> 00:42:03.517
I'm not curious about her at all.

951
00:42:04.232 --> 00:42:05.868
(Take courage, my friend)

952
00:42:06.228 --> 00:42:07.446
(Whatever)

953
00:42:07.776 --> 00:42:09.243
(Yeon-soo's quiz time really
brought the house down)

954
00:42:10.986 --> 00:42:12.392
Now it's time for my quiz.

955
00:42:12.431 --> 00:42:14.282
The last question already?

956
00:42:14.828 --> 00:42:16.428
We had such a good time.

957
00:42:16.507 --> 00:42:18.107
That was great!

958
00:42:21.158 --> 00:42:23.204
(We're done shooting today?)

959
00:42:25.806 --> 00:42:27.406
He takes our joke.

960
00:42:28.416 --> 00:42:31.212
Most of my questions are about women.

961
00:42:32.634 --> 00:42:35.103
It's about things he doesn't have,
like an illusion.

962
00:42:35.127 --> 00:42:38.618
I was in a car with a woman, about
6 years ago.

963
00:42:38.728 --> 00:42:41.001
But my stomach started hurting
really badly.

964
00:42:41.048 --> 00:42:43.595
I was holding it but...

965
00:42:44.048 --> 00:42:46.735
And I let one out, naturally.

966
00:42:46.962 --> 00:42:48.562
- You farted?
- Yes.

967
00:42:48.634 --> 00:42:50.806
But the smell was so bad.

968
00:42:50.814 --> 00:42:54.650
I was taken aback, and opened the
window just a tiny bit.

969
00:42:54.704 --> 00:42:56.884
That's how the smell can get sucked out.

970
00:42:56.963 --> 00:42:59.728
But she said something to me then.

971
00:42:59.845 --> 00:43:01.454
"It's gotta be poop!"

972
00:43:04.245 --> 00:43:06.767
(I won't let you slide)

973
00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:11.329
"Jung-soo! Did you eat poop?"

974
00:43:13.022 --> 00:43:15.328
It's a hammer party.

975
00:43:15.478 --> 00:43:18.329
"Jung-soo, don't open the window
it smells like trash."

976
00:43:18.837 --> 00:43:20.637
"Are you a piece of trash?"

977
00:43:20.775 --> 00:43:22.603
I've heard that often, but...

978
00:43:23.189 --> 00:43:25.564
"Someone must have a pig here."

979
00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:28.313
"But you're that pig! You pooped
like a pig!"

980
00:43:29.072 --> 00:43:30.872
(I'll make you poop blood!)

981
00:43:31.499 --> 00:43:33.001
Put out your hands.

982
00:43:33.032 --> 00:43:34.632
(No mercy)

983
00:43:34.681 --> 00:43:37.134
I'll act out the gesture she made.

984
00:43:39.419 --> 00:43:40.798
That's gotta be it.

985
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:45.720
"There must be something around here,
how can a human being..."

986
00:43:45.806 --> 00:43:47.767
Form it into a sentence!

987
00:43:47.869 --> 00:43:50.126
"There must be a pigsty around here!"

988
00:43:50.745 --> 00:43:54.228
(Ho-dong gets it right!)

989
00:43:56.486 --> 00:43:59.501
It's gotta be someone who's
not that young.

990
00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:01.298
Yes, that's true.

991
00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:04.150
Not many people would say, "pigsty."

992
00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:06.118
Was she older than you?

993
00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:09.946
She was about 37 or 38 then.

994
00:44:09.994 --> 00:44:12.527
See? Young people don't say
"pigsty."

995
00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:15.681
"There must be a pigsty around here,
close the window."

996
00:44:15.705 --> 00:44:18.476
You think she really didn't know?
Or she pretended so you won't be

997
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:19.282
embarrassed?

998
00:44:19.314 --> 00:44:20.914
She had no idea.

999
00:44:21.213 --> 00:44:23.532
Then you guys broke up?

1000
00:44:23.736 --> 00:44:26.431
They don't usually pick up my calls
after we hang out.

1001
00:44:29.892 --> 00:44:33.228
That's a clever way to do it,
what she said.

1002
00:44:33.415 --> 00:44:35.845
So I did that a few times.

1003
00:44:35.994 --> 00:44:38.962
I kept blaming on pigsties that must
be around.

1004
00:44:38.987 --> 00:44:40.368
I'd use that as an excuse.

1005
00:44:40.384 --> 00:44:42.126
She should've said something more.

1006
00:44:42.236 --> 00:44:46.282
"There must be a pigsty around here.
Have you had your fodder today?"

1007
00:44:47.915 --> 00:44:50.634
She was a bit dull with those things.

1008
00:44:51.095 --> 00:44:52.618
She didn't even hear it?

1009
00:44:52.658 --> 00:44:54.298
Not if it's like this.

1010
00:44:54.384 --> 00:44:56.235
The silent ones are the deadliest.

1011
00:44:56.275 --> 00:45:00.907
The silent ones smell the worst.

1012
00:45:00.994 --> 00:45:02.400
(They're the fart experts)

1013
00:45:02.439 --> 00:45:04.470
I think it's because I had a few drinks.

1014
00:45:04.517 --> 00:45:07.032
Soo-geun lets one out while we shoot.

1015
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:10.510
Sometimes my fart gives me a boost,
like a rocket.

1016
00:45:13.431 --> 00:45:15.031
How about you, Yeon-soo?

1017
00:45:15.142 --> 00:45:16.204
Me?

1018
00:45:16.228 --> 00:45:18.048
What if you need to far while
you're on a date?

1019
00:45:18.088 --> 00:45:19.978
Her body type farts loudly.

1020
00:45:21.533 --> 00:45:22.345
A loud boom!

1021
00:45:22.361 --> 00:45:23.618
You can't just hit the person?

1022
00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:26.103
Why hit the person? It was a big one?

1023
00:45:26.439 --> 00:45:28.712
We were OK with each other
farting before.

1024
00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.064
- With your boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1025
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:31.423
(Is this a true story?)

1026
00:45:31.463 --> 00:45:32.782
When you were 20?

1027
00:45:32.806 --> 00:45:34.946
He did first.

1028
00:45:35.009 --> 00:45:37.892
It's good for women to do that.

1029
00:45:38.033 --> 00:45:42.978
Holding your fart in can cause a huge
problem to your stomach later.

1030
00:45:43.064 --> 00:45:44.298
- With too much gas.
- Yeah.

1031
00:45:44.353 --> 00:45:48.470
It's the funniest tool for
a momentary laughter.

1032
00:45:48.993 --> 00:45:52.775
So I purposely hold it in until
I'm in an enclosed space.

1033
00:45:53.088 --> 00:45:54.907
It's a talent too.

1034
00:45:54.947 --> 00:45:57.480
- It is.
- It's hard to fart at will.

1035
00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:59.642
I feel too embarrassed.

1036
00:45:59.759 --> 00:46:01.985
You look like you can.

1037
00:46:04.492 --> 00:46:07.079
You don't look so clean either.

1038
00:46:08.044 --> 00:46:09.493
(I knew that already)

1039
00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:11.829
It's funny that he accepts it.

1040
00:46:12.056 --> 00:46:13.656
The second question!

1041
00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:18.400
I was in a pretend-marriage
with Kim Sook for a TV show.

1042
00:46:18.665 --> 00:46:25.931
And there was a moment I thought
she was a really cool woman.

1043
00:46:26.407 --> 00:46:27.337
When do you think it was?

1044
00:46:27.362 --> 00:46:29.446
When you saw how rich she was.

1045
00:46:30.298 --> 00:46:35.446
When she washed your feet while you were
on a trip to Japan.

1046
00:46:36.814 --> 00:46:39.923
I have very dry feet, I hate it
when people touch my feet.

1047
00:46:39.994 --> 00:46:43.306
You guys kissed, and you felt something
in your heart.

1048
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:46.095
Am I right? I'm right, aren't I?

1049
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.712
- They kissed? - Why don't you admit
to the truth while you're here?

1050
00:46:49.737 --> 00:46:53.612
- Turn around. - You could tell
us, it's okay. - Turn around!

1051
00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:56.690
You'll fart when I hit you,
if you're a real comedian.

1052
00:46:56.807 --> 00:47:01.498
The worst scene in this world is when a
small person hits another small person.

1053
00:47:01.628 --> 00:47:04.557
- Wrong! - It wasn't a recording
but an unofficial encounter.

1054
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:08.048
- Yes, it wasn't a recording.
- Either a lot of people were around...

1055
00:47:08.073 --> 00:47:11.549
or you guys had dinner and she
secretly give you her card...

1056
00:47:11.713 --> 00:47:15.080
and says, "Jung-soo, you
should pay with my card".

1057
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:19.877
Or, she pays for the whole meal and
tells everyone Jung-soo paid for it.

1058
00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:24.230
He makes you feel manly, but you
guys weren't even on the program.

1059
00:47:24.479 --> 00:47:26.557
At a dinner meeting. You'd be moved.

1060
00:47:26.682 --> 00:47:29.402
Why? Don't you have any money, Jung-soo?

1061
00:47:29.792 --> 00:47:32.252
he's paying back his debt these days.

1062
00:47:32.518 --> 00:47:35.205
There was a time when my
money wasn't my money.

1063
00:47:35.268 --> 00:47:37.251
Don't sign someone else's guarantee.

1064
00:47:37.276 --> 00:47:41.588
You were moved when she introduced
you to friends as her husband.

1065
00:47:41.815 --> 00:47:44.877
- That would be so burdensome.
- Really? - Of course.

1066
00:47:45.143 --> 00:47:49.416
I'll give you a hint. It was when I was
having a hard time. I was really down.

1067
00:47:49.565 --> 00:47:51.173
It was the hardest moment in  my life.

1068
00:47:51.198 --> 00:47:52.198
I think I know.

1069
00:47:52.339 --> 00:47:54.424
- I've got it.
- I think I know too.

1070
00:47:54.823 --> 00:47:58.823
- I know your mom passed away and...
- Yes, she passed away.

1071
00:47:59.542 --> 00:48:04.330
Kim Sook was at the funeral and stayed
at the funeral as if she was your wife.

1072
00:48:04.455 --> 00:48:05.455
You got it!

1073
00:48:06.737 --> 00:48:09.548
She stood by your side
through the whole thing.

1074
00:48:09.573 --> 00:48:12.526
She played the role of your
mom's daughter-in-law.

1075
00:48:12.612 --> 00:48:16.729
- She was there like the chief
mourner, wasn't she? - Yes, she did.

1076
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:21.541
She greeted people by half jokingly
telling people that she was my wife.

1077
00:48:21.566 --> 00:48:25.596
No one thought it to be strange since
we were a fake couple back then.

1078
00:48:25.698 --> 00:48:29.674
I was thankful when I saw her
doing that for me. I was moved.

1079
00:48:30.018 --> 00:48:32.860
- She's amazing. - Sook showed
a lot of loyalty. - Of course.

1080
00:48:32.886 --> 00:48:35.181
You never seriously thought about it?

1081
00:48:35.206 --> 00:48:37.940
Everyone told us we looked good together.

1082
00:48:38.597 --> 00:48:42.085
I thought she was great, but we
never saw each other in that way.

1083
00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:44.723
We've been colleagues for over ten-years.

1084
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.604
How could I suddenly accept
her as something else?

1085
00:48:48.018 --> 00:48:51.479
Our appearances were too big
of a hill to climb for us.

1086
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.704
- Sook likes good-looking guys too.
- Of course, she does.

1087
00:48:55.729 --> 00:49:00.580
- It's important for her. - It could be
like when Yeon-soo didn't want to kiss him.

1088
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.300
(Shaking)

1089
00:49:02.541 --> 00:49:06.018
I think I should hit you for this one.
This is all your fault.

1090
00:49:06.128 --> 00:49:07.830
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1091
00:49:08.214 --> 00:49:09.214
Did you fart?

1092
00:49:11.175 --> 00:49:12.611
- Did you ask, if I farted?
- Yeah.

1093
00:49:12.636 --> 00:49:15.869
- I didn't hear anything.
- It just smells around you.

1094
00:49:18.612 --> 00:49:20.830
It smells like fart around you.

1095
00:49:21.878 --> 00:49:24.612
We were being serious and
you brought up farting.

1096
00:49:24.706 --> 00:49:26.237
That's all you could think of?

1097
00:49:26.417 --> 00:49:28.596
- I could smell it.
- You could?

1098
00:49:28.761 --> 00:49:30.268
Now, the next question.

1099
00:49:31.214 --> 00:49:33.299
Just like Yeon-soo...

1100
00:49:33.324 --> 00:49:36.081
I've also had trouble
with the opposite sex.

1101
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:41.096
In 2003, I tried making a move on a
woman and heard something shocking.

1102
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.982
- It was 14-years ago?
- This was when I was actually popular.

1103
00:49:45.007 --> 00:49:46.939
- Something shocking?
- Match made in heaven.

1104
00:49:46.964 --> 00:49:49.532
I got it. "Please stand when
you're talking seriously".

1105
00:49:49.557 --> 00:49:50.557
Nope.

1106
00:49:52.753 --> 00:49:55.284
- You should stand up.
- I can identify with it.

1107
00:49:55.378 --> 00:49:57.470
- I said it because I know.
- You're the likeliest to get it right.

1108
00:49:57.495 --> 00:49:58.532
You see?

1109
00:49:58.557 --> 00:50:01.243
- What did you say to her?
- She told you, she had two kids.

1110
00:50:01.268 --> 00:50:02.268
Really?

1111
00:50:03.151 --> 00:50:06.323
Wait a second. I keep getting drawn in.
You're wrong.

1112
00:50:06.581 --> 00:50:08.665
I've lived a hard life. Why
are you doing this to me?

1113
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:10.001
How dare you?

1114
00:50:10.026 --> 00:50:12.948
It had a very similar tone to it.

1115
00:50:12.972 --> 00:50:14.682
A guy like you?

1116
00:50:15.034 --> 00:50:18.815
It was an answer to when I asked,
"Can I keep calling you?".

1117
00:50:18.987 --> 00:50:21.596
- I'm changing phones soon.
- Nope.

1118
00:50:21.948 --> 00:50:24.744
I'll show you how she
reacted without words.

1119
00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.300
I got it.

1120
00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:30.213
- Geez, why?
- Nope.

1121
00:50:30.456 --> 00:50:32.088
- I got it!
- It's similar.

1122
00:50:32.354 --> 00:50:35.659
- You still don't get it?
- You're really close, but no.

1123
00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:39.182
- It's not the first time we talked on
the phone. - Say it, like you did.

1124
00:50:39.283 --> 00:50:41.193
Say it, so I can get into the role.

1125
00:50:41.248 --> 00:50:43.868
Do you think it'll be okay
for me to keep calling?

1126
00:50:43.893 --> 00:50:45.725
Stop while you're ahead.

1127
00:50:46.534 --> 00:50:50.041
It's already been hard enough
taking your phone calls.

1128
00:50:51.097 --> 00:50:54.557
- I got it. Why do you keep nagging me?
- It's kind of similar.

1129
00:50:54.862 --> 00:50:56.471
Why are you so obsessed?

1130
00:50:56.511 --> 00:51:00.174
- I told you, but why can't you...
- Understand what I'm saying!

1131
00:51:00.487 --> 00:51:02.807
Why don't you understand what I'm saying?

1132
00:51:02.925 --> 00:51:06.018
Why don't you understand what I'm saying?

1133
00:51:06.159 --> 00:51:07.159
You got it!

1134
00:51:07.612 --> 00:51:11.432
- Should I be this happy about this?
- Look at how he likes it.

1135
00:51:11.807 --> 00:51:15.025
Aren't we right when we asked, why
you don't understand anything?

1136
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:20.346
Can I keep calling you? She said, "Why
don't you understand what I'm saying?".

1137
00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.181
She packed a punch with that one line.

1138
00:51:22.206 --> 00:51:24.080
Ouch, that's hurtful.

1139
00:51:25.003 --> 00:51:27.112
How long did you meet her?

1140
00:51:27.175 --> 00:51:30.229
We dated about two or three times.
It was after that.

1141
00:51:30.284 --> 00:51:34.119
- She was mean.
- I don't think she knew how to reject me.

1142
00:51:34.511 --> 00:51:36.798
Are you usually a bit obtuse at
understanding what people say?

1143
00:51:36.823 --> 00:51:39.525
Yes, I think so. It's kind of
hard for me to understand.

1144
00:51:39.643 --> 00:51:41.540
You're only focused on your emotions.

1145
00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:46.935
You like her, so it's not important the
way the other person feels about him.

1146
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.193
He's like a dating professor.

1147
00:51:48.218 --> 00:51:50.579
I think I could've been like
that when I was younger.

1148
00:51:50.604 --> 00:51:51.782
It's would be hard for the other person.

1149
00:51:51.807 --> 00:51:54.979
He's a dating professor for
everyone else, but himself.

1150
00:51:56.464 --> 00:51:59.366
- That was 2003, let's move onto 2005.
- Again?

1151
00:51:59.706 --> 00:52:02.889
Another woman told me
something shocking as well.

1152
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.385
A shocking statement in 2005.

1153
00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:07.984
Do you see what's going on?

1154
00:52:08.009 --> 00:52:11.448
In 2003, he tried coming onto
a woman and got blown away.

1155
00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:16.791
He rested a year and regained
his confidence in 2005.

1156
00:52:16.893 --> 00:52:18.752
That's why he tried again.

1157
00:52:18.886 --> 00:52:20.377
I got it, I have the answer.

1158
00:52:20.651 --> 00:52:21.651
- I got it.
- I got it.

1159
00:52:21.893 --> 00:52:23.639
Clean your ears out!

1160
00:52:24.097 --> 00:52:25.393
- Clean your ears?
- What's that?

1161
00:52:25.607 --> 00:52:28.111
It was during the early stages of dating.

1162
00:52:28.136 --> 00:52:30.587
The previous person, I
went on at least 3 dates.

1163
00:52:30.612 --> 00:52:33.258
Would it be okay, if I
treated you special?

1164
00:52:33.283 --> 00:52:35.901
- I got it!
- No, wait a second. I got it.

1165
00:52:36.636 --> 00:52:38.595
- Entertainers shouldn't act like that.
- Nope!

1166
00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.471
I got it. Say your line to me.

1167
00:52:40.636 --> 00:52:44.711
- Would it be okay, if I treated you
special? - You're making me uncomfortable.

1168
00:52:44.736 --> 00:52:45.736
You got it!

1169
00:52:45.925 --> 00:52:47.682
(Hee-chul quickly gets it right)

1170
00:52:47.846 --> 00:52:48.846
What was it?

1171
00:52:48.964 --> 00:52:52.491
She said, "What the heck? You're
making me feel uncomfortable".

1172
00:52:52.612 --> 00:52:53.900
You made her uncomfortable.

1173
00:52:53.925 --> 00:52:58.393
- That was short and sweet. - How could
you make a move when you hear that?

1174
00:52:58.495 --> 00:52:59.971
You can't get upset either.

1175
00:53:00.034 --> 00:53:04.166
I said, "It seems like we're a
good match after talking to you.

1176
00:53:04.425 --> 00:53:07.221
Do you mind if I treated you special?".

1177
00:53:07.425 --> 00:53:10.370
She said, "What the heck? You're
making me feel uncomfortable".

1178
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:13.830
She didn't even hesitate. She
didn't wait a second to say that.

1179
00:53:14.198 --> 00:53:18.210
You need to stay with the woman, who
sent you the congratulatory message.

1180
00:53:18.893 --> 00:53:23.014
You got totally rejected in 2003
when you tried making a move.

1181
00:53:23.104 --> 00:53:27.036
You made someone feel uncomfortable in
2005. You didn't make a move in 2004?

1182
00:53:27.061 --> 00:53:29.378
I'm about to ask you my question for 2004.

1183
00:53:29.518 --> 00:53:32.089
(He never stops trying to make a move)

1184
00:53:32.393 --> 00:53:36.799
I moved this question toward the end
since 2004's answer is a sentence.

1185
00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:39.463
We were wondering why 2004 was missing.

1186
00:53:39.542 --> 00:53:42.999
There's no reason for me to stop.
There's no stopping me!

1187
00:53:43.182 --> 00:53:46.080
- You didn't date them, you were
just making a move. - Of course!

1188
00:53:46.354 --> 00:53:51.080
- He's already been rejected. - The way
I see it, he makes his move too fast.

1189
00:53:51.167 --> 00:53:52.596
- That's true.
- He's not patient.

1190
00:53:52.745 --> 00:53:58.690
He doesn't give the woman any time for
them to think about what's going on.

1191
00:53:58.916 --> 00:54:01.596
He just makes his move
whether she's ready or not.

1192
00:54:01.886 --> 00:54:04.362
Isn't it better for a guy
to profess his feelings...

1193
00:54:04.526 --> 00:54:06.549
before the third date is up?

1194
00:54:06.581 --> 00:54:09.893
My friends use a new word these days.
It's three-after.

1195
00:54:10.128 --> 00:54:11.182
Three-after?

1196
00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:15.296
If there aren't any feelings after three
dates, then it's not worth going forward.

1197
00:54:15.484 --> 00:54:16.782
That's how I feel too.

1198
00:54:16.807 --> 00:54:19.940
- It's over after three dates, if you
don't feel anything? - Yes, that's right.

1199
00:54:19.987 --> 00:54:24.674
That's only possible when both parties
are attracted to one another.

1200
00:54:25.237 --> 00:54:28.428
Jung-soo made a move when the women
didn't feel anything for him.

1201
00:54:28.476 --> 00:54:30.454
I'm sure that's not true. Don't say that.

1202
00:54:30.479 --> 00:54:31.925
No, that's possible.

1203
00:54:32.101 --> 00:54:36.112
When you're making moves on the opposite
sex and you want to make her...

1204
00:54:36.429 --> 00:54:38.807
your woman, it's best to wait a bit.

1205
00:54:39.354 --> 00:54:41.940
He's such a well-informed
dating professor.

1206
00:54:42.236 --> 00:54:45.001
He's such a well-informed dating professor.

1207
00:54:47.175 --> 00:54:48.712
A very well-informed professor.

1208
00:54:48.737 --> 00:54:51.556
Not a regular professor, but
a well-informed professor.

1209
00:54:51.581 --> 00:54:55.034
I haven't heard well-informed
professor in a long time.

1210
00:54:56.331 --> 00:54:59.291
I can't think of anything to say
back to him because it's so funny.

1211
00:54:59.307 --> 00:55:03.088
Jang-hoon is theoretically the perfect guy.

1212
00:55:03.245 --> 00:55:05.266
I'm not theoretically
perfect but think about it.

1213
00:55:05.291 --> 00:55:11.174
Do you think I just laid around and
didn't do anything except for my ex-wife?

1214
00:55:11.643 --> 00:55:14.491
Do you think I didn't date
before getting married?

1215
00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.900
- Did you date in secret?
- Is that how you took it?

1216
00:55:16.925 --> 00:55:20.573
- You dated after you got divorced.
- Not after, before I got married.

1217
00:55:20.627 --> 00:55:23.694
- Before.
- Before and after? - Before.

1218
00:55:23.719 --> 00:55:24.890
Before.

1219
00:55:24.915 --> 00:55:29.183
It might have hurt then, but
it's important to be exact.

1220
00:55:29.229 --> 00:55:31.392
It's best to let the other
person know how you feel.

1221
00:55:31.417 --> 00:55:33.820
It might be better for me
to hear someone be blunt...

1222
00:55:33.845 --> 00:55:37.269
because if they're nice, I might
misunderstand that again.

1223
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:41.088
- That's so sad.
- Why did she date you, in the first place?

1224
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:43.995
Wasn't that the best answer she could give?

1225
00:55:44.151 --> 00:55:46.823
It wasn't too bad for her to say
she felt uncomfortable, was it?

1226
00:55:46.933 --> 00:55:48.932
Her "What the heck" was really high.

1227
00:55:49.089 --> 00:55:52.213
"What the heck? You're making
me feel uncomfortable".

1228
00:55:53.339 --> 00:55:56.276
It would've been fine, if she
said it the way you did.

1229
00:55:56.573 --> 00:55:58.283
She shouted, "What the heck?".

1230
00:55:58.308 --> 00:56:01.947
- She tried playing it off.
- She thought he was totally senseless.

1231
00:56:01.972 --> 00:56:03.924
- Let's go with 2004.
- Okay, 2004.

1232
00:56:04.198 --> 00:56:06.292
The answer is pretty long.

1233
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:08.257
A long sentence.

1234
00:56:08.401 --> 00:56:09.892
- I...
- You professed your feelings again.

1235
00:56:09.917 --> 00:56:13.417
I went so far to say this sentence.
What do you think I said?

1236
00:56:13.862 --> 00:56:16.159
Do you really hate me that much?

1237
00:56:17.534 --> 00:56:19.151
No, but it's kinds of...

1238
00:56:19.308 --> 00:56:23.460
- Do you think you're that great?
- No, then I couldn't date her anymore.

1239
00:56:24.401 --> 00:56:25.948
Think before you talk.

1240
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:30.064
- She wouldn't date me anymore.
- We're not allowed to say those things.

1241
00:56:30.089 --> 00:56:33.095
- I like you so much. Don't you see
the way I feel about you? - No.

1242
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.225
- Don't you see my muscles?
- No.

1243
00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:39.784
You can use me all you
want, just don't leave me.

1244
00:56:40.026 --> 00:56:41.026
Nope.

1245
00:56:41.425 --> 00:56:44.206
- Can't I just stay by your side?
- No.

1246
00:56:44.432 --> 00:56:46.466
You can treat me like your credit card.

1247
00:56:46.491 --> 00:56:48.272
Nope. I'll tell you what I said.

1248
00:56:48.472 --> 00:56:51.077
Do you treat your
boyfriend like this too?

1249
00:56:51.846 --> 00:56:54.182
That's what I said, "Do you treat
your boyfriend like this too?".

1250
00:56:54.207 --> 00:56:57.369
- You just said the answer. - No, that's
what I said because she was so mean.

1251
00:56:57.394 --> 00:57:00.729
- What did she say back to me?
- We're guessing her reply?

1252
00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:03.538
You're not my boyfriend.

1253
00:57:03.769 --> 00:57:06.010
"No, I don't treat my boyfriend like this".

1254
00:57:06.323 --> 00:57:08.377
- You got it.
- Yes, that's right.

1255
00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:11.764
- He's a well-informed professor.
- Well-informed!

1256
00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:13.893
- Well-informed.
- Well-informed.

1257
00:57:14.144 --> 00:57:16.577
I'm hurt when I think about
what happened but...

1258
00:57:16.602 --> 00:57:21.120
the instant I heard it, I realized
I shouldn't make a move anymore.

1259
00:57:21.526 --> 00:57:23.370
Because those are hurtful words.

1260
00:57:23.925 --> 00:57:26.126
She cut you off even
before you tried anything.

1261
00:57:26.151 --> 00:57:28.745
I think Jung-soo is fast to make
a move, but fast to give up.

1262
00:57:28.847 --> 00:57:32.659
That's because he wasn't
crazy in love with her.

1263
00:57:33.386 --> 00:57:36.635
- You'd still go after her if you loved
her. - I'm realistic about love.

1264
00:57:36.839 --> 00:57:41.463
I'm not the type to keep forcing a woman
to like me if she's not interested.

1265
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.811
It's not right for me to keep liking
someone when they don't feel the same...

1266
00:57:45.932 --> 00:57:48.398
and someone else to like me.
It's all the same.

1267
00:57:48.423 --> 00:57:49.853
Someone liked you?

1268
00:57:49.878 --> 00:57:51.697
You don't think anyone could've liked me?

1269
00:57:51.722 --> 00:57:53.502
That's what we think.

1270
00:57:53.581 --> 00:57:59.018
I get better as time passes by and
I'm in a long-term relationship.

1271
00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:03.893
These are instances when two people are
trying to figure out how they feel.

1272
00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:07.302
Let's pretend that I met her for the
first time and I was interested.

1273
00:58:07.327 --> 00:58:08.517
Why does it have to be me?

1274
00:58:08.542 --> 00:58:10.491
Why does it have to be me?

1275
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:14.444
- She doesn't want you pretending.
- You're the only female here!

1276
00:58:14.573 --> 00:58:17.564
- She doesn't even want to think about it.
- You're the only female!

1277
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:20.667
- Don't pretend.
- That's how mad you get at women?

1278
00:58:20.745 --> 00:58:23.041
It's unpleasant for her to think about it.

1279
00:58:24.105 --> 00:58:25.674
She's offended by your suggestion!

1280
00:58:25.784 --> 00:58:29.354
- No wonder women think you make them
uncomfortable. - Why don't you get it?

1281
00:58:29.401 --> 00:58:32.494
Why would you be uncomfortable
when I'm saying it so nicely?

1282
00:58:32.519 --> 00:58:34.385
- But...
- Wait a second.

1283
00:58:34.683 --> 00:58:36.463
You're too much, too.

1284
00:58:36.917 --> 00:58:39.088
He was just using an example.

1285
00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.064
- She won't even let him use her as an
example. - She knows what she likes.

1286
00:58:43.089 --> 00:58:44.745
Let's say I was interested in her.

1287
00:58:45.058 --> 00:58:47.623
Somehow, we exchanged phone numbers.

1288
00:58:47.776 --> 00:58:50.284
But when I call, she doesn't answer.

1289
00:58:50.558 --> 00:58:55.252
When I call back a week later, I'll
talk to her and then get rejected.

1290
00:58:55.355 --> 00:58:59.448
That's when I should get it, but instead,
I call back a couple times more.

1291
00:59:00.245 --> 00:59:03.042
You're lacking a vital part of dating.

1292
00:59:03.737 --> 00:59:08.315
You do certain things to make
your counterpart fall for you.

1293
00:59:08.534 --> 00:59:11.909
- No, I don't. There's no push or pull to
me. - You don't know how to slowly move in.

1294
00:59:11.956 --> 00:59:13.815
You go forward without thinking.

1295
00:59:13.933 --> 00:59:16.798
You're a well-informed dating
professor, aren't you?

1296
00:59:16.823 --> 00:59:18.639
We have two professors?

1297
00:59:18.664 --> 00:59:22.058
Unfortunately, the two professors
are Jang-hoon and Sang-min.

1298
00:59:22.886 --> 00:59:27.135
You become well-informed when
you're tragically hurt by someone.

1299
00:59:27.253 --> 00:59:31.276
You learn a lot about love when
this and that happens in your life.

1300
00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:33.838
- Of course, you do.
- What do you guys know anyways?

1301
00:59:33.995 --> 00:59:36.938
There's a famous proverb
about knowing pain.

1302
00:59:36.963 --> 00:59:39.549
I have questions until 2015!

1303
00:59:39.815 --> 00:59:41.963
I think we can call it day with these.

1304
00:59:42.175 --> 00:59:43.713
That was too funny.

1305
00:59:44.308 --> 00:59:46.674
Talking about love is the funniest.

1306
00:59:50.347 --> 00:59:51.932
(My daughter is too precious)

1307
00:59:51.995 --> 00:59:54.424
Honey, are you coming home today?

1308
00:59:55.183 --> 00:59:58.706
I'm your husband, can't I
ask if you're coming home?

1309
00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:01.713
And also... Hello?

1310
01:00:02.112 --> 01:00:03.760
Hello? Sook!

1311
01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:08.018
How does she always hang up after
she's done saying what she wants?

1312
01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.237
Geez, seriously.

1313
01:00:09.495 --> 01:00:11.596
Mom's not coming home today, dad?

1314
01:00:11.995 --> 01:00:15.170
Yeah. It's been 28-years
since she last came home.

1315
01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:16.924
- But, dad?
- Yeah?

1316
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.588
Do you still love mom when you
haven't seen her in 28-years?

1317
01:00:22.198 --> 01:00:23.198
Of course.

1318
01:00:23.448 --> 01:00:27.690
For 28-years, she's been automatically
depositing money into my account.

1319
01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.666
You can't find a better mom.

1320
01:00:29.753 --> 01:00:32.526
I wouldn't care if she
didn't come for 280-years.

1321
01:00:32.808 --> 01:00:34.838
That's what our love amounts to.

1322
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:37.096
That's the kind of guy you should meet too.

1323
01:00:37.237 --> 01:00:38.760
- Okay, okay.
- Good.

1324
01:00:39.054 --> 01:00:40.054
I'm serious.

1325
01:00:40.456 --> 01:00:43.979
But, dad. I actually found a guy
I'd like to get married to.

1326
01:00:44.862 --> 01:00:47.518
A guy you want to marry? Really?

1327
01:00:47.628 --> 01:00:50.284
Yes, he's coming over to introduce himself.

1328
01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:53.897
- He's coming here?
- Yes, I wonder what's taking so long.

1329
01:00:53.995 --> 01:00:54.995
Really?

1330
01:00:55.487 --> 01:00:56.948
Hello, father.

1331
01:00:57.065 --> 01:00:58.713
- Who are you?
- Hello.

1332
01:00:59.339 --> 01:01:01.034
- I'm Yeon-soo's boyfriend.
- Hello.

1333
01:01:01.059 --> 01:01:02.954
- You're her boyfriend?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

1334
01:01:02.979 --> 01:01:03.979
- Yeon-soo!
- Hello.

1335
01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:06.995
- Who are these people, Yeon-soo?
- Who is he?

1336
01:01:07.347 --> 01:01:11.248
- Hello, father. - Why are you all
of you wearing shoes in my house?

1337
01:01:11.605 --> 01:01:13.495
You're wearing your shoes too, father.

1338
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.346
I'm wearing my house slippers.

1339
01:01:15.519 --> 01:01:17.229
We're Americanized. Sit down, everyone.

1340
01:01:17.276 --> 01:01:19.651
- How's your health, father?
- Why did you invite so many people?

1341
01:01:19.745 --> 01:01:21.314
Sit down. You should sit first.

1342
01:01:21.339 --> 01:01:24.331
Hold on, Yeon-soo. I'm sorry
but can you guys leave?

1343
01:01:24.487 --> 01:01:27.830
- I'm her boyfriend. - I'm her
boyfriend. Don't keep calling her name.

1344
01:01:28.042 --> 01:01:30.251
Excuse me, we're not buying that.
Please, leave.

1345
01:01:30.276 --> 01:01:32.220
I'm not here to sell products.

1346
01:01:32.417 --> 01:01:34.799
How can you be disrespectful
if you're her boyfriend?

1347
01:01:34.972 --> 01:01:38.245
I didn't bring a present since
those gifts are useless.

1348
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:43.840
I wanted to give you a small apartment
building, it's already in your name.

1349
01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:46.752
Aren't you going too far?

1350
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.712
- There isn't any collateral
security on it? - No.

1351
01:01:49.737 --> 01:01:52.643
- It's free and clear.
- Only my name is on the title?

1352
01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:56.800
An apartment building for you to
enjoy during your retirement.

1353
01:01:57.276 --> 01:02:00.666
What's going on, Yeon-soo?
Who are all these people?

1354
01:02:00.753 --> 01:02:03.893
- Dad. - What?
- These are all my boyfriends.

1355
01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:07.362
- How could you?
- This can't be.

1356
01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:09.556
- You're amazing.
- What kind of woman, are you?

1357
01:02:09.581 --> 01:02:13.127
- You're a player.
- It doesn't end here. There's more.

1358
01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:15.064
- There's more?
- I'm shocked.

1359
01:02:15.089 --> 01:02:16.089
Yeon-soo!

1360
01:02:17.659 --> 01:02:20.451
- There's more?
- I'm shocked. - Yeon-soo!

1361
01:02:22.034 --> 01:02:24.948
Who is he? He keeps following me in here.

1362
01:02:25.159 --> 01:02:28.048
I'd rather leave my own house.
This is annoying.

1363
01:02:28.073 --> 01:02:31.096
Men keep following me in here, Yeon-soo!

1364
01:02:31.308 --> 01:02:34.721
This is cheating! He gets
to wear a wig every week!

1365
01:02:34.823 --> 01:02:36.830
Isn't he the idiot from
the other neighborhood?

1366
01:02:36.855 --> 01:02:39.440
- I'm Yeon-soo's boyfriend.
- Take a seat first.

1367
01:02:39.636 --> 01:02:43.393
- I'm sorry, stop playing. I know
you're her uncle. - Don't say that!

1368
01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:47.174
Why do you keep calling me her
uncle, when I'm her boyfriend!

1369
01:02:47.229 --> 01:02:48.987
You're her uncle!

1370
01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:52.010
Look at Yeon-soo! She's sitting next to me.

1371
01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:55.854
Yeon-soo! Yeon-soo! How can
you date someone like him?

1372
01:02:55.948 --> 01:03:00.409
- You shouldn't hold arms with just
anyone, Yeon-soo. - He's so strange.

1373
01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.221
I put Yeon-soo on my back and took her
up and down Namsan Mountain stairs.

1374
01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.635
You should sit next to your dad instead.

1375
01:03:07.823 --> 01:03:10.533
Think back to those days
and get on my back.

1376
01:03:10.558 --> 01:03:13.772
Remember how I gave you
that piggy-back ride?

1377
01:03:13.797 --> 01:03:15.667
You remember, don't you?

1378
01:03:16.222 --> 01:03:17.728
She doesn't remember?

1379
01:03:17.753 --> 01:03:19.401
Come sit over here.

1380
01:03:20.519 --> 01:03:21.519
I'm hungry!

1381
01:03:22.339 --> 01:03:25.901
I'm sure you're hungry.
Go get something to eat.

1382
01:03:26.323 --> 01:03:29.635
- Give him 2 meal tickets and
send him away. - Two won't do.

1383
01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:33.147
- You shouldn't press your luck, old man.
- Old man?

1384
01:03:33.464 --> 01:03:35.081
How many times will this be?

1385
01:03:35.159 --> 01:03:37.369
- How can you call me old man?
- Don't you have a conscience?

1386
01:03:37.394 --> 01:03:41.971
- I'm 10-years younger than you!
- How dare you sit next to my Yeon-soo?

1387
01:03:42.269 --> 01:03:43.784
I know you're married.

1388
01:03:44.073 --> 01:03:45.073
- Who?
- You.

1389
01:03:45.815 --> 01:03:49.401
It's better than getting divorced.
At least I look responsible.

1390
01:03:49.619 --> 01:03:51.721
Stop it. Being married and
divorced are all the same.

1391
01:03:51.769 --> 01:03:54.955
- It's better being divorced.
- How did you become her dad?

1392
01:03:55.151 --> 01:04:00.120
Sit down and come to your senses. Are
you all really my daughter's boyfriend?

1393
01:04:00.292 --> 01:04:01.642
- Of course.
- Yes.

1394
01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:03.549
Why are all of you here?

1395
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:06.979
They're not all her boyfriends.
I'm her real boyfriend and...

1396
01:04:07.003 --> 01:04:10.337
- I wanted to introduce...
- He's been engaged 28-times.

1397
01:04:10.362 --> 01:04:13.167
- Really?
- He's only been officially divorced once.

1398
01:04:13.284 --> 01:04:14.478
This is getting out of hand.

1399
01:04:14.503 --> 01:04:17.331
I'd like to officially ask for
your daughter's hand in marriage.

1400
01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.167
Father, Shintoburi!

1401
01:04:19.448 --> 01:04:22.971
Exciting Saturday, Burning Sunday.

1402
01:04:23.987 --> 01:04:27.331
That's all in the past. I'm
thinking about my daughter now.

1403
01:04:27.503 --> 01:04:30.948
The more I think about it, you
have unique taste, Yeon-soo.

1404
01:04:31.019 --> 01:04:32.392
You sure date strange people.

1405
01:04:32.417 --> 01:04:35.062
How audacious for you to say that?

1406
01:04:36.136 --> 01:04:38.917
Who is strange? Who are
you saying is strange?

1407
01:04:39.112 --> 01:04:41.557
I think you top the list for being strange!

1408
01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.830
Didn't you wear a doll's mask
and show up at my house?

1409
01:04:44.855 --> 01:04:46.197
That's how you came!

1410
01:04:46.222 --> 01:04:49.940
How come you're still wearing a mask?
Take it off!

1411
01:04:51.175 --> 01:04:52.526
I told you to take it off!

1412
01:04:52.698 --> 01:04:54.195
Shintoburi, father.

1413
01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:57.456
Exciting Saturday, Burning Sunday.

1414
01:04:57.878 --> 01:05:01.049
Saturday night is exciting!

1415
01:05:02.128 --> 01:05:05.604
I might have a variety of boyfriends but...

1416
01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.331
I don't know which person I should marry.

1417
01:05:08.612 --> 01:05:11.862
- Can you choose your son-in-law?
- Okay, let's decide together.

1418
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:14.455
I'd like to introduce myself first, father.

1419
01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:18.245
I'm more than confident that I
can make Yeon-soo happy, father.

1420
01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.370
I'll make sure she doesn't
have to move an inch...

1421
01:05:21.644 --> 01:05:24.206
and I'll take the responsibility
of doing everything for her.

1422
01:05:24.401 --> 01:05:27.237
He's just a burden, that's all.
He's not helping her.

1423
01:05:27.347 --> 01:05:29.397
I keep getting goosebumps
whenever I see you.

1424
01:05:29.422 --> 01:05:32.956
- Why, father?
- I know how hard it is for you these days.

1425
01:05:33.081 --> 01:05:36.136
You're in no situation to
love anyone right now.

1426
01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:41.683
- It's okay. - Try again and start
fresh when you're not in debt anymore.

1427
01:05:41.823 --> 01:05:44.289
- One person is out.
- My gosh. Geez.

1428
01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:46.979
You don't sound so well.

1429
01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:49.838
How can you groan so
much just getting up?

1430
01:05:50.323 --> 01:05:53.049
- You should be young and healthy.
- My name is Seo Jang-hoon.

1431
01:05:53.136 --> 01:05:55.988
Sit down. Previously
married people are out.

1432
01:05:56.596 --> 01:05:58.260
Sit down. Sit down.

1433
01:05:58.558 --> 01:06:00.885
- When was he married.
- I know he was.

1434
01:06:01.003 --> 01:06:05.034
In my opinion... Excuse me, Yeon-soo's
uncle. Could you keep it down?

1435
01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:08.534
- No! Why do you keep calling me her uncle?
- Oh, my goodness.

1436
01:06:08.972 --> 01:06:12.195
He wore orange to make himself look young.

1437
01:06:12.894 --> 01:06:14.745
How can a 56-year-old wear orange?

1438
01:06:14.769 --> 01:06:18.737
- You're scaring me!
- Which university is this? University of?

1439
01:06:18.925 --> 01:06:22.143
- Where is that school. - There's no
school name, just "University of".

1440
01:06:22.198 --> 01:06:23.955
- Where is this school?
- What school is this?

1441
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.831
It's supposed to say "Off"
but he's missing an "F".

1442
01:06:27.073 --> 01:06:29.307
His interest in education is off.

1443
01:06:30.807 --> 01:06:35.174
Father, I can accept the fact that
Yeon-soo dated before getting married.

1444
01:06:35.628 --> 01:06:39.159
For marriage, I'd like her to choose
someone that's similar to you.

1445
01:06:39.355 --> 01:06:40.775
I think you understand me best.

1446
01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.112
To be honest, I've been
keeping an eye on you.

1447
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:45.203
I wanted to kick you out first.

1448
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:46.589
Why, father?

1449
01:06:47.065 --> 01:06:49.908
I tried imagining our family
walking around together.

1450
01:06:49.933 --> 01:06:52.206
We'd be disrespected if we stood together.

1451
01:06:52.417 --> 01:06:55.109
- Look at the three of us.
- My goodness!

1452
01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:56.875
Peekaboo!

1453
01:06:57.073 --> 01:07:00.140
- People might not like you
for saying this. - For what?

1454
01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:04.393
I can make these kinds of jokes since
I'm short as well. It doesn't matter.

1455
01:07:04.628 --> 01:07:05.628
Go ahead and sit down.

1456
01:07:05.729 --> 01:07:06.972
- And, you...
- Yes?

1457
01:07:07.012 --> 01:07:10.519
I can't help but think
I'm looking down on you.

1458
01:07:10.714 --> 01:07:12.033
- Father.
- I'm looking down.

1459
01:07:12.058 --> 01:07:15.144
Your head is down, but
your eyes are looking up.

1460
01:07:15.737 --> 01:07:18.526
Are you sure, I'm not looking down at you?

1461
01:07:20.487 --> 01:07:22.652
I really think I'm looking down.

1462
01:07:22.722 --> 01:07:26.206
Father! Will you please give
Yeon-soo's hand in marriage to me...

1463
01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:31.354
for the sake of our next generation
and the baby's intelligence?

1464
01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:35.948
Sit down. I read all the rumors
about you, you're no joke.

1465
01:07:36.448 --> 01:07:37.448
Father!

1466
01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:41.135
I'm Kang Ho-dong, the son of Korea!

1467
01:07:42.136 --> 01:07:46.088
Don't you feel secure just
by looking at me, father?

1468
01:07:47.448 --> 01:07:50.245
I'll make sure to protect Yeon-soo!

1469
01:07:50.284 --> 01:07:53.307
I think he's from the
University of Gorilla.

1470
01:07:53.511 --> 01:07:55.143
It's Planet of the Apes.

1471
01:07:55.597 --> 01:07:57.517
Give Yeon-soo to me, father!

1472
01:07:57.542 --> 01:08:00.603
Okay, let's say you've been starving
on a deserted island for three-days.

1473
01:08:00.628 --> 01:08:03.768
A piece of chicken appears. Are you
going to eat it or give it to Yeon-soo?

1474
01:08:03.987 --> 01:08:06.285
- He might eat Yeon-soo.
- Forget it.

1475
01:08:06.597 --> 01:08:07.597
That's scary!

1476
01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.440
He'll become a cannibal!

1477
01:08:10.706 --> 01:08:12.793
He'll become a cannibal, for sure.

1478
01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.556
I've been starving for 3-days?

1479
01:08:14.581 --> 01:08:18.557
- There's only one piece of chicken.
- You're out because you hesitated.

1480
01:08:18.823 --> 01:08:21.502
- Starving for 3-days?
- You're still out.

1481
01:08:21.589 --> 01:08:22.902
This is confusing.

1482
01:08:23.276 --> 01:08:25.884
It looks like everyone is disqualified.

1483
01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:28.237
Looks like I'm the only one left, father.

1484
01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.101
You'd be disqualified even if all
these people weren't here. Sit down.

1485
01:08:32.315 --> 01:08:35.135
You'd be disqualified anyways.

1486
01:08:35.714 --> 01:08:40.073
"Real Men", "Law of the
Jungle" and "With You".

1487
01:08:40.183 --> 01:08:42.792
Every time I do a show
with you, I get cursed at.

1488
01:08:42.964 --> 01:08:44.376
You're the one, who was wrong.

1489
01:08:44.401 --> 01:08:48.026
Yeon-soo, how come you can't
bring home anyone suitable?

1490
01:08:48.901 --> 01:08:52.510
- That's not true, dad. - You can see
how strange everyone is, can't you?

1491
01:08:53.065 --> 01:08:54.065
- Look.
- Dad!

1492
01:08:54.198 --> 01:08:55.455
- What?
- I take after you.

1493
01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.034
What do you mean?
That's not true.

1494
01:08:58.355 --> 01:09:01.072
I never had a group, I only
dated one person at a time.

1495
01:09:01.097 --> 01:09:03.734
You're making us uncomfortable, father.

1496
01:09:05.018 --> 01:09:07.603
You really don't understand
what I'm saying, do you?

1497
01:09:07.628 --> 01:09:09.948
They might not look normal now...

1498
01:09:10.089 --> 01:09:12.643
but if you take a closer
look, they're all nice guys.

1499
01:09:12.909 --> 01:09:14.518
How close do I need to look?

1500
01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:16.448
First, let's eat something.

1501
01:09:16.612 --> 01:09:17.886
- Okay.
- Eat together?

1502
01:09:18.065 --> 01:09:19.955
That's right, Yeon-soo
makes spaghetti well.

1503
01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:22.316
- How do you know?
- I ate it before.

1504
01:09:22.565 --> 01:09:23.565
I ate it too.

1505
01:09:23.737 --> 01:09:26.081
- hold on.
- Yeon-soo makes good pollack roe pasta.

1506
01:09:26.237 --> 01:09:28.767
You make a mean palla. Squid ink palla.

1507
01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:31.159
Are you referring to
Paella, a Spanish dish?

1508
01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.198
It's not palla, but Paella.

1509
01:09:34.995 --> 01:09:37.417
- Your skirt is pretty, Yeon-soo.
- Yes, it is.

1510
01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:39.738
Is that the skirt I bought you?

1511
01:09:40.386 --> 01:09:41.948
- It wasn't you.
- It was me.

1512
01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.542
- My dad bought it for me.
- I bought it with my money.

1513
01:09:44.612 --> 01:09:47.875
Really? Did the skirt I bought
you, have a bigger rip in it?

1514
01:09:48.346 --> 01:09:50.531
He's digging himself a grave.

1515
01:09:51.511 --> 01:09:55.351
- Are you okay? - If I was her
real father, you'd be dead by now.

1516
01:09:55.948 --> 01:09:58.238
Seriously. I would've killed you.

1517
01:09:58.674 --> 01:10:01.172
I'm growing my stamina these days.

1518
01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.292
Kids these days are so fast.

1519
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:07.007
- You can't talk about bigger rips in
a skirt. - He's being fashionable.

1520
01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:10.370
Let's see if the pasta is
cooked before we eat the dish.

1521
01:10:10.737 --> 01:10:12.909
- How?
- We can try eating it together.

1522
01:10:13.362 --> 01:10:15.105
- With who?
- With you guys.

1523
01:10:15.245 --> 01:10:18.284
- You and me?
- You and me, you and me, you and me...

1524
01:10:18.558 --> 01:10:20.792
you and me, you and me, you and me.

1525
01:10:20.847 --> 01:10:22.745
(You and I will never...)

1526
01:10:22.948 --> 01:10:25.635
You can't lay things out
for them like that.

1527
01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:27.501
I'll use every line.

1528
01:10:27.526 --> 01:10:28.526
Say, "Dda".

1529
01:10:28.862 --> 01:10:30.690
"Dda"? Oh, okay. "Dda".

1530
01:10:31.105 --> 01:10:34.010
- "Dda", what? - You're supposed
to use that for a funny line!

1531
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.892
- You can't even use what they give you.
- Geez, seriously!

1532
01:10:36.917 --> 01:10:39.360
- Everyone understood.
- How hard could that be?

1533
01:10:39.385 --> 01:10:42.369
I think missing that timing
was kicking your luck away.

1534
01:10:43.042 --> 01:10:46.159
What the heck? I really
didn't understand.

1535
01:10:46.495 --> 01:10:48.490
Why didn't anyone tell me?

1536
01:10:48.823 --> 01:10:50.557
I can't believe I missed that.

1537
01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:52.011
Look over here.

1538
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:55.690
We're going to eat this together,
like the Peppero Game.

1539
01:10:56.956 --> 01:11:01.409
The person that leaves the shortest
length is the person that loves me most.

1540
01:11:01.651 --> 01:11:03.002
Wait a second!

1541
01:11:03.042 --> 01:11:05.690
- You're going to do this game
with everyone here? - Yeah.

1542
01:11:05.831 --> 01:11:08.854
Did you really think of this game for us?

1543
01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:11.651
- Yes, I thought of this.
- You wanted to do this?

1544
01:11:11.714 --> 01:11:15.260
- Yeah. - I'd like to be
first to try this with her.

1545
01:11:16.073 --> 01:11:20.049
Why? I'm upset. Why did you
think of this game, Yeon-soo?

1546
01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.674
- Why?
- You don't have to do it.

1547
01:11:23.604 --> 01:11:25.362
You don't want to share your food, do you?

1548
01:11:25.472 --> 01:11:27.635
You're getting a lot of
static on your head.

1549
01:11:27.761 --> 01:11:29.768
Guys! Can you be quiet?

1550
01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:32.073
Only courageous men get a
beautiful woman, like me.

1551
01:11:32.159 --> 01:11:33.331
- Okay.
- Good.

1552
01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.823
I guess you're courageous, getting
a beautiful person like me.

1553
01:11:37.058 --> 01:11:39.120
- See if they touch lips.
- Okay.

1554
01:11:39.417 --> 01:11:41.139
Get ready. It's the first person.

1555
01:11:41.386 --> 01:11:44.026
Hee-chul isn't good at these games either.

1556
01:11:44.213 --> 01:11:46.190
- You start eating the noodle.
- Start!

1557
01:11:46.355 --> 01:11:48.135
Go little-by-little. Slowly.

1558
01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:52.779
Slowly. Whoa! You can't
put your hand up here!

1559
01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.760
(Are they touching?)

1560
01:11:56.831 --> 01:11:57.831
Did they touch?

1561
01:11:58.596 --> 01:12:00.815
Hee-chul is a total player.

1562
01:12:01.675 --> 01:12:02.675
(Stop it)

1563
01:12:03.347 --> 01:12:05.206
Good. They're done. Spit it out.

1564
01:12:05.776 --> 01:12:07.838
- This is Hee-chul's.
- Is this why you came here?

1565
01:12:08.128 --> 01:12:10.354
I'll put Hee-chul's here. Next.

1566
01:12:10.605 --> 01:12:14.119
- How come my turn came so fast?
- It's Yeong-cheol and Yeon-soo.

1567
01:12:14.144 --> 01:12:15.144
I'm starting.

1568
01:12:17.425 --> 01:12:20.095
Yeon-soo could cut it off
if she doesn't like him.

1569
01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.120
She's aggressive.

1570
01:12:21.815 --> 01:12:24.001
- She's not cutting it off?
- I can't stand this.

1571
01:12:24.026 --> 01:12:25.752
I can't stand watching this.

1572
01:12:26.245 --> 01:12:29.237
Why did you do that? Father!

1573
01:12:30.159 --> 01:12:33.752
Isn't this cheating, father?
We're supposed to cut it.

1574
01:12:35.026 --> 01:12:36.659
Get going, move out of the way.

1575
01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:39.010
It could be over 6 inches long.

1576
01:12:39.245 --> 01:12:42.698
- Father!
- Excuse me, sir. When did you get there?

1577
01:12:43.261 --> 01:12:45.947
- You already reset everything too.
- He sure is fast.

1578
01:12:45.972 --> 01:12:50.768
Let's hurry it up. Why does everyone
want to play, when she's my girlfriend?

1579
01:12:51.417 --> 01:12:53.659
He's in such a hurry right now.

1580
01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.205
Do they look good together?

1581
01:12:56.230 --> 01:12:57.230
(Laughing)

1582
01:12:58.995 --> 01:13:00.604
- Bring it here.
- Done.

1583
01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:03.667
- That's all you could do?
- I got embarrassed.

1584
01:13:03.994 --> 01:13:06.854
- What the heck?
- When did you become so shy?

1585
01:13:07.315 --> 01:13:10.542
- Next is Kyung-hoon.
- Yeon-soo is so aggressive.

1586
01:13:10.722 --> 01:13:12.220
Let me clean this dried pollack first.

1587
01:13:12.245 --> 01:13:14.471
Don't you have to try your best for games?

1588
01:13:14.628 --> 01:13:17.233
- Why is everyone acting so shy?
- I know!

1589
01:13:17.261 --> 01:13:19.417
Think about your son, Si-woo.

1590
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.620
(Sits back down)

1591
01:13:20.815 --> 01:13:23.549
- Why are you so nervous?
- Aren't we professionals?

1592
01:13:23.574 --> 01:13:25.854
- Start!
- Be a pro, not an amateur.

1593
01:13:26.526 --> 01:13:28.173
They're getting too close.

1594
01:13:28.198 --> 01:13:30.471
- She cut it!
- She cut it off first.

1595
01:13:30.784 --> 01:13:33.611
She cut it off because you
came at her too fast.

1596
01:13:33.636 --> 01:13:35.729
- Can I try again?
- There's no seconds.

1597
01:13:35.933 --> 01:13:38.900
Professionals don't ask for second chances.
I'm going to try my best!

1598
01:13:38.925 --> 01:13:41.423
If you want to curse at me, go ahead.
I'm not scared.

1599
01:13:41.448 --> 01:13:43.237
He was married five-times.

1600
01:13:43.464 --> 01:13:45.323
He's already 56-years-old.

1601
01:13:45.862 --> 01:13:47.815
How could you be so bold to mention that?

1602
01:13:48.088 --> 01:13:49.376
(Well, that's true)

1603
01:13:52.573 --> 01:13:53.573
(Laughing)

1604
01:13:54.925 --> 01:13:56.471
What's wrong with you?

1605
01:13:56.855 --> 01:13:59.462
You're a well-informed
marriage professor too.

1606
01:13:59.487 --> 01:14:03.462
I'm going to try my best. I think a
professional should always try their best.

1607
01:14:03.487 --> 01:14:04.487
Okay.

1608
01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.139
Can you go slowly? Don't come in suddenly.

1609
01:14:09.167 --> 01:14:10.986
My daughter is a bit aggressive.

1610
01:14:11.011 --> 01:14:13.251
- He's embarrassed about what he said.
- Start when he says, "Start".

1611
01:14:13.276 --> 01:14:15.440
- He said, "Start".
- That's it!

1612
01:14:15.753 --> 01:14:16.753
(Falls down)

1613
01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:20.139
- That's the end.
- You're finished.

1614
01:14:20.605 --> 01:14:23.275
- You're disqualified. - Someone
else's noodle is longer than mine.

1615
01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.299
Almost eight inches.

1616
01:14:25.659 --> 01:14:27.760
- Look at this.
- It's really long.

1617
01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:30.986
- Use a longer one, Soo-geun.
- I'll start short.

1618
01:14:31.011 --> 01:14:32.011
Here.

1619
01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.912
- You're too much.
- You're cheating.

1620
01:14:36.713 --> 01:14:40.018
If that's how you want it,
use a short and thick one.

1621
01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:44.139
(A heaping scoop)

1622
01:14:44.573 --> 01:14:45.573
Use that.

1623
01:14:47.463 --> 01:14:49.158
Is it too much? Is it too hard for you?

1624
01:14:49.183 --> 01:14:52.135
I'm sorry, but I might get indigestion.

1625
01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.932
Put it here, put it back here.

1626
01:14:55.198 --> 01:14:56.198
That's too much.

1627
01:14:56.323 --> 01:14:58.448
Tell us the winner, father!

1628
01:14:58.612 --> 01:15:01.807
- Did you win, Hee-chul?
- Yes, Kim Hee-chul won.

1629
01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:05.682
There is a penalty for the
person, who came in last.

1630
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:08.581
I'll hit someone with this
dried pollack as plenty.

1631
01:15:08.776 --> 01:15:10.361
Who came in last?

1632
01:15:10.386 --> 01:15:11.792
- Kang Ho-dong.
- Ho-dong?

1633
01:15:11.878 --> 01:15:14.205
- Ho-dong's is the longest.
- That's right.

1634
01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:16.432
Come to the front, orange pig.

1635
01:15:17.355 --> 01:15:18.355
Orange pig?

1636
01:15:18.803 --> 01:15:21.178
(Somehow orange pig
sounds a bit refreshing)

1637
01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:23.987
- Use two, dad.
- It actually sounds delicious.

1638
01:15:24.183 --> 01:15:26.901
- Orange pig.
- I'm the orange pig? - Come out.

1639
01:15:28.073 --> 01:15:29.729
Fermented orange pork belly.

1640
01:15:29.823 --> 01:15:32.342
(Ho-dong prepares for his penalty)

1641
01:15:32.370 --> 01:15:34.323
I have to hit your feet. Lay down.

1642
01:15:35.355 --> 01:15:38.056
It'll be hard for me to get
back up if I lay down.

1643
01:15:38.081 --> 01:15:40.673
You don't have to get back up.
Keep laying down.

1644
01:15:40.698 --> 01:15:42.373
Lay down and go to sleep.

1645
01:15:42.698 --> 01:15:44.088
He can't lay down.

1646
01:15:44.292 --> 01:15:46.846
Hold on, you need to hold the leg up.

1647
01:15:46.987 --> 01:15:48.483
I can hit him well.

1648
01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:51.018
You want to get hit from me.

1649
01:15:51.315 --> 01:15:53.104
You want to get hit from me.

1650
01:15:53.589 --> 01:15:55.206
What did you do?

1651
01:15:55.573 --> 01:15:58.518
- What happened, Soo-geun?
- Lay down, everyone!

1652
01:15:58.573 --> 01:16:00.486
(The enemy is coming)

1653
01:16:01.206 --> 01:16:03.299
Did it hurt? No, it didn't hurt.

1654
01:16:04.042 --> 01:16:06.377
I'm sorry, only you got hurt, Soo-geun.

1655
01:16:06.737 --> 01:16:08.783
I'm sorry, only you got hurt, Soo-geun.

1656
01:16:08.808 --> 01:16:12.345
Anyways, Hee-chul can't get married to
Yeon-soo with this one competition.

1657
01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:16.022
I have another test. You're too
precious for just one game.

1658
01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:20.182
First, I raised my daughter preciously
because I didn't want her to get hurt.

1659
01:16:20.323 --> 01:16:24.588
That's why, I want to pick someone
who is physically strong.

1660
01:16:24.644 --> 01:16:26.571
- Men need to be physically strong.
- That's right.

1661
01:16:26.596 --> 01:16:29.818
I raised my daughter for
28-years with this body.

1662
01:16:31.159 --> 01:16:33.256
I don't know how hard it was raising her.

1663
01:16:33.417 --> 01:16:37.034
I can only give you my daughter,
if you come close to my body.

1664
01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:42.057
I'll make you my son-in-law if
you can win me at leg wrestling.

1665
01:16:42.105 --> 01:16:43.275
- With you, father?
- Yeah.

1666
01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.995
I shouldn't say this, but you have knees.

1667
01:16:46.847 --> 01:16:48.432
Of course, I have knees.

1668
01:16:48.511 --> 01:16:50.666
We didn't think you had knees.

1669
01:16:51.175 --> 01:16:53.245
You though I only had thighs?

1670
01:16:53.292 --> 01:16:55.830
You thought I only had thighs
and it connected to my feet?

1671
01:16:55.855 --> 01:16:58.837
We though your feet were connected to
your thighs and then, to your hips.

1672
01:16:58.862 --> 01:17:00.787
No one can look like that.

1673
01:17:01.737 --> 01:17:04.947
You're going to keep getting
disqualified, you XXXX!

1674
01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:07.564
(I can't have a jerk like
him for a son-in-law)

1675
01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:09.647
You're getting me annoyed.

1676
01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:12.018
(He forgets Yeon-soo and
chooses laughter instead)

1677
01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.111
Look at his socks. Aren't those socks
supposed to only come up to here?

1678
01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:20.596
- Aren't those the same socks?
- You must have ankle socks on.

1679
01:17:20.621 --> 01:17:24.862
- How come his socks come up to his knees?
- Don't they usually stop here?

1680
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:28.643
How come you get more annoyed
with Soo-geun than anyone else?

1681
01:17:28.698 --> 01:17:30.587
Don't socks come up to here, father?

1682
01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:32.932
I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t raise her to see someone like him.

1683
01:17:33.397 --> 01:17:35.415
I can't she brought him
into the house. No way.

1684
01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:39.229
The game is easy. Two people lay
down and latch their legs together.

1685
01:17:39.667 --> 01:17:42.548
Whoever makes the other
person fall is the winner.

1686
01:17:42.573 --> 01:17:46.346
Hee-chul, can you show us
an example with father?

1687
01:17:46.433 --> 01:17:49.354
- Hee-chul is disqualified since
his leg hurts. - His leg hurts.

1688
01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:52.830
- Is it because his leg is too white?
- No, he has a metal plate in his leg.

1689
01:17:52.855 --> 01:17:56.041
Really? Bring me magnets, let's
see if it attaches to him.

1690
01:17:58.292 --> 01:18:00.190
(Begins the test immediately)

1691
01:18:00.215 --> 01:18:01.908
- Hold still.
- Wait!

1692
01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:04.690
You scared me.

1693
01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:08.846
- He's allowed to skip this game.
- You're not kidding around, father!

1694
01:18:09.448 --> 01:18:13.870
- Father! Shintoburi! - Exciting
Saturday... stop making me do it!

1695
01:18:14.558 --> 01:18:17.423
- Let's have preliminaries.
- The winner goes against father.

1696
01:18:17.448 --> 01:18:20.252
- I'll play against the winners.
- Sounds good.

1697
01:18:20.831 --> 01:18:23.791
- The way I see it...
- The weaklings can go first.

1698
01:18:23.816 --> 01:18:26.826
It's best for Kyung-hoon and
Yeong-cheol to go first.

1699
01:18:26.948 --> 01:18:29.127
- Okay.
- Yeong-cheol isn't that weak.

1700
01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:31.807
I'm considered weak in this crowd.

1701
01:18:32.706 --> 01:18:36.139
- Like this?
- Yeah, you have go down that far.

1702
01:18:37.148 --> 01:18:40.928
(The two-potential son-in-law
cautiously take their positions)

1703
01:18:42.073 --> 01:18:43.940
- Start!
- This is for real. Start.

1704
01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:46.557
- Start!
- This is for real. Start.

1705
01:18:46.964 --> 01:18:48.834
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's right.

1706
01:18:48.859 --> 01:18:51.581
I know what to do now. I get it.

1707
01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:54.463
That's right, that's good.

1708
01:18:58.946 --> 01:19:00.416
(Rolls over)

1709
01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:02.698
Hey! What are you guys doing?

1710
01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.401
Kim Yeong-cheol wins!

1711
01:19:04.605 --> 01:19:07.424
- Did I win?
- All you have to do is flip them over?

1712
01:19:07.675 --> 01:19:11.096
- That was it! That's funny.
- That was a big match-up.

1713
01:19:11.315 --> 01:19:13.511
- That was it.
- Thank you.

1714
01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:16.667
He's good.

1715
01:19:16.948 --> 01:19:19.393
- Up next is...
- Come here.

1716
01:19:20.276 --> 01:19:22.455
- Come here.
- Good. - Never mind, you come here.

1717
01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.049
Let's go, Sang-min.

1718
01:19:24.269 --> 01:19:26.440
Try and win. His leg strength is gone.

1719
01:19:26.605 --> 01:19:29.049
- His legs are shot.
- Ho-dong isn't the same anymore.

1720
01:19:29.245 --> 01:19:32.862
We used to train by going down
on one leg and standing back up.

1721
01:19:34.737 --> 01:19:36.076
What was that?

1722
01:19:36.308 --> 01:19:39.072
- You used to do that.
- You used to be able to get up.

1723
01:19:39.097 --> 01:19:41.354
I might get hypnotized by your socks.

1724
01:19:42.136 --> 01:19:45.401
- He might have a snake in there.
- Lift your leg up.

1725
01:19:45.573 --> 01:19:47.345
You're disqualified if your
leg can't go up that high.

1726
01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:49.487
Can you lock legs? We're not starting yet.

1727
01:19:49.589 --> 01:19:51.162
- Your legs can lock together?
- Yeah, it's possible.

1728
01:19:51.206 --> 01:19:52.206
Are you ready?

1729
01:19:52.964 --> 01:19:53.964
(Glaring)

1730
01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:57.042
Get ready! Start!

1731
01:20:02.084 --> 01:20:03.764
(Rolls away)

1732
01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.447
(The game ends in less than a second)

1733
01:20:06.948 --> 01:20:10.127
Are you okay? You're fine
since you made people laugh.

1734
01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:12.635
Are you okay? Does your neck hurt?

1735
01:20:12.815 --> 01:20:15.056
I'm going to compliment you, for once.

1736
01:20:15.081 --> 01:20:17.416
- Good reaction.
- This is no joke.

1737
01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:21.548
- Please, give me your permission.
- Who are you?

1738
01:20:21.573 --> 01:20:23.705
Sang-min tried getting greedy.

1739
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.620
You can't help but flip over.

1740
01:20:25.645 --> 01:20:28.595
I'm proud all these men are
interested in my daughter.

1741
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.955
- You can start the match, father.
- Okay, let's start them off.

1742
01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:33.665
- Is this right?
- I don't think I can lock legs with him.

1743
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:36.318
- Let's try first.
- Put your leg up for me.

1744
01:20:36.987 --> 01:20:38.654
Wow, they can lock legs.

1745
01:20:39.394 --> 01:20:40.951
(The splits)

1746
01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.971
- I can at least lock legs.
- Get ready!

1747
01:20:45.206 --> 01:20:47.272
He's too strong. Wait a second.

1748
01:20:47.428 --> 01:20:48.553
(It hurts for me too)

1749
01:20:48.803 --> 01:20:51.237
I'm sorry, but can I use both legs?

1750
01:20:51.792 --> 01:20:53.361
The length is too drastic.

1751
01:20:53.386 --> 01:20:54.932
It's more disadvantageous for me!

1752
01:20:55.042 --> 01:20:58.244
- You're hammering me down from above!
- I can't lock legs with you.

1753
01:20:58.269 --> 01:21:00.354
- Get ready!
- How is this possible?

1754
01:21:01.105 --> 01:21:02.105
Start!

1755
01:21:04.284 --> 01:21:05.568
He's flexible!

1756
01:21:08.144 --> 01:21:09.268
Who won?

1757
01:21:10.103 --> 01:21:11.170
Did Soo-geun win?

1758
01:21:11.195 --> 01:21:12.808
- He got flipped over.
- He lost.

1759
01:21:12.909 --> 01:21:18.065
- He got flipped. - This isn't fair. I
can't compete. His leg weighs too much.

1760
01:21:18.855 --> 01:21:20.971
My leg was stretched out.

1761
01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:24.034
Why was he screaming his head off?

1762
01:21:24.776 --> 01:21:27.509
I'll just lay here. Tell the
next person to come here.

1763
01:21:27.534 --> 01:21:29.267
The next person is Yeong-cheol.

1764
01:21:29.292 --> 01:21:32.596
- Yeong-cheol is next.
- One of us can go against Ho-dong.

1765
01:21:33.706 --> 01:21:36.470
- Excuse me. - I'll go against he
winner of this match or Ho-dong.

1766
01:21:36.495 --> 01:21:38.276
I'm sorry, but may I ask for a favor?

1767
01:21:38.558 --> 01:21:40.331
- Please, don't fight.
- No, we won't fight.

1768
01:21:40.409 --> 01:21:43.557
- Did someone say we're fighting.
- Don't get into a verbal fight.

1769
01:21:43.714 --> 01:21:46.674
He might be better since his
leg is longer than yours.

1770
01:21:46.761 --> 01:21:47.761
Get ready!

1771
01:21:47.917 --> 01:21:50.034
Jang-hoon's leg gets stronger at the end.

1772
01:21:50.073 --> 01:21:51.073
Ready...

1773
01:21:51.745 --> 01:21:52.745
(Start)

1774
01:21:53.183 --> 01:21:56.612
- I can lock legs. This is okay.
- It feels like you could win, doesn't it?

1775
01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:59.604
That's when it feels like
you could win, doesn't it?

1776
01:22:01.124 --> 01:22:02.572
(Starts slapping)

1777
01:22:03.253 --> 01:22:05.932
Jang-hoon! Please, save me.

1778
01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.034
Jang-hoon! This hurts too much.
My neck hurts! Stop!

1779
01:22:10.628 --> 01:22:13.290
Why does it hurt so much
playing against Jang-hoon?

1780
01:22:13.315 --> 01:22:15.806
- You can't win.
- I can't come close to Jang-hoon.

1781
01:22:15.831 --> 01:22:17.542
The heavier person has an advantage.

1782
01:22:17.675 --> 01:22:19.573
It's because Jang-hoon has long legs.

1783
01:22:19.683 --> 01:22:22.134
- This is the semi-finals.
- This will be a tough match.

1784
01:22:22.159 --> 01:22:23.510
I'll just go first.

1785
01:22:23.839 --> 01:22:26.432
Ho-dong can go against father first.

1786
01:22:27.081 --> 01:22:29.010
Go up against the orange pig.

1787
01:22:29.128 --> 01:22:31.698
Where did the pig go? Where did he go?

1788
01:22:32.112 --> 01:22:35.548
- A match made in heaven!
- Jang-hoon is going to win.

1789
01:22:35.573 --> 01:22:37.123
Hold on a second, father.

1790
01:22:37.581 --> 01:22:41.565
I'll move this over, so you don't
hit it when you roll over here.

1791
01:22:42.472 --> 01:22:46.081
I'm going to send you toward
the refrigerator, father.

1792
01:22:46.331 --> 01:22:47.331
Over that way.

1793
01:22:47.433 --> 01:22:49.627
Excuse me, Ho-dong. Ho-dong!

1794
01:22:50.034 --> 01:22:53.830
- Ho-dong! - Are you going to see
a funeral before getting married?

1795
01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:57.174
I'm going to throw you with a slice.
Be careful.

1796
01:22:57.886 --> 01:23:01.588
I'm going to throw you
over toward the fridge.

1797
01:23:01.886 --> 01:23:04.358
- Jung-soo is strong.
- Lay down, father.

1798
01:23:05.144 --> 01:23:08.323
- Can my leg go up this high?
- You have to move lower.

1799
01:23:08.698 --> 01:23:10.182
Wow, this is amazing.

1800
01:23:10.448 --> 01:23:12.854
He'll have an advantage since he's shorter.

1801
01:23:13.394 --> 01:23:15.694
- Should I go lower?
- No, you're fine.

1802
01:23:15.831 --> 01:23:17.173
Get yourselves ready.

1803
01:23:17.198 --> 01:23:19.983
- Get ready!
- I'm more flexible than you think.

1804
01:23:20.183 --> 01:23:21.619
Wow, look at his calf.

1805
01:23:21.644 --> 01:23:23.077
Start!

1806
01:23:25.628 --> 01:23:26.628
Wow, look at his calf.

1807
01:23:27.065 --> 01:23:28.065
Start!

1808
01:23:28.316 --> 01:23:29.316
(Starts)

1809
01:23:32.405 --> 01:23:33.405
(Heave-ho)

1810
01:23:34.917 --> 01:23:35.917
(Screaming)

1811
01:23:37.737 --> 01:23:41.639
(He slams him down as
soon as the match starts)

1812
01:23:43.417 --> 01:23:44.901
(Knock down)

1813
01:23:45.933 --> 01:23:46.933
Father!

1814
01:23:48.112 --> 01:23:50.463
Father! You've gotten younger, father.

1815
01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.542
You've gotten younger.

1816
01:23:52.675 --> 01:23:53.675
Father!

1817
01:23:54.253 --> 01:23:56.128
You've gotten younger, father.

1818
01:23:56.284 --> 01:23:59.752
I feel like I've turned around,
but I don't know what happened.

1819
01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:01.464
You can yell, "I give up".

1820
01:24:01.558 --> 01:24:04.353
Please yell, "I give up" if you think
you're going to lose, Jang-hoon.

1821
01:24:04.378 --> 01:24:07.577
I'll see first. You need to
come down lower, ho-dong.

1822
01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:10.620
Isn't this the first-time you
guys have battled like this?

1823
01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:13.526
(It's the strongest man winner versus
the man with the heaviest legs)

1824
01:24:13.612 --> 01:24:15.135
My glasses are ruined.

1825
01:24:15.995 --> 01:24:18.073
The six-footer might fly over that way.

1826
01:24:18.667 --> 01:24:20.936
Move those shoes away. I might fly.

1827
01:24:21.292 --> 01:24:24.126
This will be the perfect space
if he flips over this way.

1828
01:24:24.151 --> 01:24:25.956
He won't bump into the wall.

1829
01:24:26.136 --> 01:24:29.252
Soo-geun, I'm going to lock
his leg and flip him over.

1830
01:24:29.526 --> 01:24:33.604
It'd be really funny if you flipped
him over and made him stand.

1831
01:24:34.698 --> 01:24:36.393
Watch carefully, father.

1832
01:24:36.722 --> 01:24:39.417
- Your hair is parted differently, father.
- What?

1833
01:24:39.706 --> 01:24:42.385
- Do what you want, I'm tired.
- Get ready!

1834
01:24:42.862 --> 01:24:43.862
Get ready!

1835
01:24:44.165 --> 01:24:45.165
(Start)

1836
01:24:46.887 --> 01:24:48.585
(A close game)

1837
01:24:50.678 --> 01:24:51.678
(Screaming)

1838
01:24:52.183 --> 01:24:53.518
He's lifting him up!

1839
01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:55.220
(He lifts up the giant)

1840
01:24:55.245 --> 01:24:56.823
He's lifting him up!

1841
01:24:56.848 --> 01:24:58.736
(He turns l180-degrees like a windmill)

1842
01:24:58.761 --> 01:24:59.761
He lifted him up.

1843
01:25:00.292 --> 01:25:02.983
It's no wonder he won the
strongest man competition.

1844
01:25:03.204 --> 01:25:05.815
(The strongest leg wrestler, Ho-dong)

1845
01:25:06.276 --> 01:25:07.729
(Jumps up and down)

1846
01:25:07.956 --> 01:25:10.760
(I kicked the giant with my foot)

1847
01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:17.292
- It felt different than anyone else.
- Ho-dong is so strong.

1848
01:25:17.698 --> 01:25:20.725
His strength is different
than other people.

1849
01:25:21.026 --> 01:25:24.112
How is this an important
factor for marriage, father?

1850
01:25:24.409 --> 01:25:28.854
Now that I think about it, it doesn't
have anything to do with marriage.

1851
01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:32.557
- You're right.
- He just looked strong and ignorant.

1852
01:25:33.042 --> 01:25:36.565
I want to thank all seven
of you for your hard work.

1853
01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.604
All seven of you guys line up.

1854
01:25:38.745 --> 01:25:41.979
Yeon-soo will hug the
person she likes the most.

1855
01:25:42.315 --> 01:25:43.751
- Back hug?
- Yes, back hug.

1856
01:25:43.776 --> 01:25:46.235
- She can't hug you from the front.
- Close your eyes.

1857
01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:47.853
No peeping.

1858
01:25:48.128 --> 01:25:50.197
You choose, Yeon-soo. I'll stay here.

1859
01:25:50.222 --> 01:25:54.040
- Choose the person, who made your heart
beat faster. - Yes, the games don't matter.

1860
01:25:54.065 --> 01:25:55.752
- I'm going.
- Okay.

1861
01:25:56.105 --> 01:25:58.436
You're not going to use
"Match Made in Heaven's"...

1862
01:25:58.461 --> 01:26:01.350
show idea and have
father hug us, are you?

1863
01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:04.463
(Whispering)

1864
01:26:06.983 --> 01:26:09.877
(They do exactly what
Hee-chul was worried about)

1865
01:26:11.105 --> 01:26:13.205
I told you not to open your eyes.

1866
01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:16.549
My goodness. You sure are old, aren't you?

1867
01:26:16.745 --> 01:26:19.514
Don't blame your mishaps on me now.

1868
01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:23.838
- Why did you make me do such weird things?
- Sorry.

1869
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:26.284
You shouldn't do everything she says.

1870
01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.042
No, she came over and...

1871
01:26:28.401 --> 01:26:29.401
(Pointing)

1872
01:26:30.128 --> 01:26:32.649
(Her dad couldn't resist his
daughter's cutesy acts)

1873
01:26:32.722 --> 01:26:34.674
- It's real now.
- We're serious.

1874
01:26:35.214 --> 01:26:37.103
We're all on the same playing field.

1875
01:26:37.253 --> 01:26:42.278
Wait a second! Choose a person you didn't
like the most during today's games.

1876
01:26:42.303 --> 01:26:43.673
- And push him?
- Yes, push him.

1877
01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:44.899
Good, push him.

1878
01:26:45.198 --> 01:26:46.917
The person you liked the least.

1879
01:26:47.247 --> 01:26:50.673
(Being the least favorite is more nerving
than being chosen as her husband)

1880
01:26:50.784 --> 01:26:51.784
(Noise)

1881
01:26:51.901 --> 01:26:54.321
- Geez, that scared me.
- What was that?

1882
01:26:54.855 --> 01:26:56.479
The lights scared me.

1883
01:26:57.026 --> 01:26:58.923
It'd be funny if the light hits us.

1884
01:26:59.355 --> 01:27:00.355
Wait a second!

1885
01:27:01.761 --> 01:27:02.761
Wait a second!

1886
01:27:04.291 --> 01:27:07.431
What time is it? I think she pushed you.
I saw you moving.

1887
01:27:07.456 --> 01:27:10.409
- Didn't she push you?
- No, I don't think so.

1888
01:27:10.909 --> 01:27:12.794
(Everyone is confused)

1889
01:27:13.417 --> 01:27:15.446
You didn't play an active role today.

1890
01:27:15.519 --> 01:27:16.519
He wasn't active.

1891
01:27:16.753 --> 01:27:19.298
- Choose the person you like most.
- Make a reasonable choice.

1892
01:27:19.323 --> 01:27:22.784
- Try and be reasonable.
- Does she already have a winner in mind?

1893
01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:26.665
- It's more fun disqualifying people.
- Keep pushing people you don't like.

1894
01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:28.638
(She's starting to push everyone)

1895
01:27:29.762 --> 01:27:32.563
(Who will be the next person she pushes?)

1896
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:35.356
(Jang-hoon is disqualified)

1897
01:27:35.495 --> 01:27:36.831
- Go out slowly.
- I'm sorry but...

1898
01:27:36.948 --> 01:27:39.307
Stop your whining and move on over.

1899
01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:43.167
- Move over.
- Keep moving!

1900
01:27:43.651 --> 01:27:45.431
- I wasn't...
- You don't get to talk.

1901
01:27:45.478 --> 01:27:48.545
I wasn't interested in
you from the beginning.

1902
01:27:48.823 --> 01:27:50.524
Who do you think you are?

1903
01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:54.268
who the hell are you? Hey!
You're not my style either!

1904
01:27:54.542 --> 01:27:57.510
You're kidding me. Hey! Forget you!

1905
01:27:58.433 --> 01:27:59.433
Geez!

1906
01:28:00.097 --> 01:28:02.510
He sure is a poor loser, isn't he?

1907
01:28:02.535 --> 01:28:05.338
We used to pretend there was a cliff here.

1908
01:28:05.386 --> 01:28:08.450
- Push another person.
- Let's see your falling performance.

1909
01:28:08.636 --> 01:28:10.216
There's a cliff here.

1910
01:28:10.378 --> 01:28:13.548
- It's Niagara Falls.
- You guys lucked out being chosen first.

1911
01:28:13.573 --> 01:28:16.081
I'm jealous. He's making us act now.

1912
01:28:17.097 --> 01:28:19.354
Let's see how they fall at Niagara Falls.

1913
01:28:20.005 --> 01:28:21.800
Why are you pushing me already?

1914
01:28:24.886 --> 01:28:27.610
I feel like it took him too long to fall.

1915
01:28:28.339 --> 01:28:30.188
You still fared better than most.

1916
01:28:30.477 --> 01:28:33.446
(Without delay, they begin
choosing the next person)

1917
01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.126
(Sang-min is chosen)

1918
01:28:35.368 --> 01:28:38.048
- You have to fall.
- Do your performance.

1919
01:28:38.399 --> 01:28:39.399
What's that?

1920
01:28:39.852 --> 01:28:40.852
Damn it.

1921
01:28:43.942 --> 01:28:45.477
(Trips over)

1922
01:28:46.438 --> 01:28:48.258
He fell over the rug.

1923
01:28:48.384 --> 01:28:49.782
He has no leg strength.

1924
01:28:49.907 --> 01:28:52.789
What are you reaching in the empty air?

1925
01:28:53.173 --> 01:28:54.757
Close your eyes, guys.

1926
01:28:54.782 --> 01:28:56.970
(There are only three left)

1927
01:28:57.392 --> 01:28:59.017
(Who will be disqualified?)

1928
01:28:59.931 --> 01:29:00.931
(Pushes)

1929
01:29:01.556 --> 01:29:03.532
Help me, Geunduun!

1930
01:29:04.063 --> 01:29:05.962
Whoa? Where's my cloud?

1931
01:29:07.777 --> 01:29:10.353
Wow, that's an amazing performance.

1932
01:29:10.926 --> 01:29:12.290
(Father is pleased)

1933
01:29:13.087 --> 01:29:16.368
- You knew you were going to get pushed.
- Yes, I knew.

1934
01:29:16.845 --> 01:29:20.188
Wow, look at how happy he is. You
can tell what he's thinking.

1935
01:29:21.032 --> 01:29:23.297
- He's so happy.
- This is more pathetic.

1936
01:29:24.398 --> 01:29:25.899
He's so happy.

1937
01:29:25.924 --> 01:29:27.413
Hee-chul might get nervous.

1938
01:29:27.438 --> 01:29:30.547
- I'm nervous, I am. - I'll give up
now. I'm satisfied with how far I got.

1939
01:29:30.704 --> 01:29:32.028
You can't do that.

1940
01:29:32.087 --> 01:29:34.794
- You can't do that.
- You want me to keep going?

1941
01:29:36.134 --> 01:29:37.570
You're not confident?

1942
01:29:37.595 --> 01:29:39.266
Do I push him or hug him?

1943
01:29:39.368 --> 01:29:42.259
- You need to hug him now.
- I need to hug him?

1944
01:29:42.384 --> 01:29:44.196
- Okay, guys.
- Close your eyes!

1945
01:29:44.336 --> 01:29:45.657
- Okay.
- I'm going!

1946
01:30:45.643 --> 01:30:47.564
- Okay, guys.
- Close your eyes!

1947
01:30:47.589 --> 01:30:49.048
- Okay.
- I'm going!

1948
01:30:49.073 --> 01:30:51.542
- Stop peeping, Hee-chul.
- That's right.

1949
01:30:52.323 --> 01:30:55.452
Alright, barbarian. No, I mean orange pig!
Stop crossing your arm!

1950
01:30:55.612 --> 01:30:57.952
(It's hard to take back
such strong name-calling)

1951
01:30:58.127 --> 01:31:01.182
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
Don't cross your arms.

1952
01:31:02.213 --> 01:31:03.682
Okay, I'm going.

1953
01:31:03.761 --> 01:31:05.845
(It's really time for the last choice)

1954
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:07.086
Keep your eyes closed.

1955
01:31:07.111 --> 01:31:09.475
(Who will Yeon-soo choose?)

1956
01:31:10.897 --> 01:31:12.682
(Begins to move)

1957
01:31:14.006 --> 01:31:16.135
(They both hug at the same time)

1958
01:31:16.387 --> 01:31:17.387
(Laughing)

1959
01:31:17.412 --> 01:31:19.182
You're going to die now.

1960
01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:21.534
Wait a second! I'm sorry!

1961
01:31:21.986 --> 01:31:23.733
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1962
01:31:24.557 --> 01:31:28.126
You know I'm not that kind of person.
I don't like doing this.

1963
01:31:28.151 --> 01:31:30.381
You know I don't do this.
Jung-soo told me to!

1964
01:31:30.604 --> 01:31:31.986
Jung-soo told me to do it!

1965
01:31:32.338 --> 01:31:34.198
He's sincerely scared.

1966
01:31:36.032 --> 01:31:37.844
(Please, help him)

1967
01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:42.378
No, wait! I don't like this.
You know I don't like this!

1968
01:31:43.963 --> 01:31:46.112
(The real barbarian has here)

1969
01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:48.736
Look! It's the barbarian! The barbarian!

1970
01:31:49.893 --> 01:31:51.666
I'm really sorry, I am.

1971
01:31:51.807 --> 01:31:55.206
(Previews of our new transfer
student will air shortly)

1972
01:31:58.161 --> 01:32:02.198
(Beautiful melodies from the gayageum
pull at the men's heartstrings)

1973
01:32:02.695 --> 01:32:03.695
(Infatuated)

1974
01:32:04.393 --> 01:32:08.275
- Come on over here!
- Let's play piggy-back rides.

1975
01:32:08.752 --> 01:32:09.752
Hello.

1976
01:32:10.275 --> 01:32:12.727
I'm even pretty when I breathe,
my name is Lee Ha-nui.

1977
01:32:12.752 --> 01:32:14.822
(This is what "Honey" is like)

1978
01:32:14.939 --> 01:32:16.650
She came out because I called her.

1979
01:32:16.877 --> 01:32:19.430
He said, "I'm here, who cares
about anything else?".

1980
01:32:19.455 --> 01:32:21.385
- I'm so embarrassed.
- It must be a true story!

1981
01:32:21.518 --> 01:32:23.548
She graduated from Seoul University.

1982
01:32:23.573 --> 01:32:27.061
- She looks younger without make up on.
- Okay, we got it.

1983
01:32:28.801 --> 01:32:30.236
Isn't he being strange today?

1984
01:32:30.354 --> 01:32:32.337
He's putting so much effort in today.

1985
01:32:32.362 --> 01:32:34.979
- Are you happy that I'm here?
- I am.

1986
01:32:35.315 --> 01:32:36.924
I'm happy as well.

1987
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:38.733
(We can't avoid the watch bet)

1988
01:32:38.827 --> 01:32:40.178
Forget that.

1989
01:32:40.409 --> 01:32:42.003
(This time, they bet shoes)

1990
01:32:42.143 --> 01:32:43.572
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1991
01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:46.010
- Just a bit.
- Go slowly, slowly.

1992
01:32:47.042 --> 01:32:49.815
- Ha-nui can't do this.
- This is too low.

1993
01:32:50.151 --> 01:32:51.835
(Stretching out)

1994
01:32:53.411 --> 01:32:55.782
- She's going.
- I told you, she could do it!

1995
01:32:55.807 --> 01:32:57.983
(The games aren't over yet)

1996
01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:03.030
(Who will be the winner of the last
match, filled with made up dances?)

1997
01:33:03.957 --> 01:33:05.514
(I'm tired, I'm going to rest)

1998
01:33:05.573 --> 01:33:07.991
Try and close me up. It's
nice and cozy in here.

1999
01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:10.463
Let's move onto the activity!

2000
01:33:10.488 --> 01:33:13.102
("Ask Us Anything", every Saturday
nights at 8:50. Don't miss it)

2001
01:33:13.127 --> 01:33:14.694
Cham, cham, cham!

2002
01:33:15.245 --> 01:33:18.596
What are you doing? Why are
you looking at my chest?

2003
01:33:19.875 --> 01:33:20.875
How dare you!

2004
01:33:20.987 --> 01:33:24.510
That's where my eyes land
when you're my height.
