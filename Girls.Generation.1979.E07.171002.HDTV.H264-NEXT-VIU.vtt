3
00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:08.135
Dong Moon.

4
00:00:10.604 --> 00:00:11.604
What?

5
00:00:11.905 --> 00:00:14.014
Why aren't you saying that?

6
00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:18.444
What?

7
00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:21.115
"Do you want to get pastries?"

8
00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:23.554
- That. - That was...

9
00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:27.194
sort of like my strategy when I liked you...

10
00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:29.854
as a girl.

11
00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:31.725
As a girl?

12
00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:34.794
Then what? Am I a boy now?

13
00:00:34.794 --> 00:00:36.095
That's not it.

14
00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.434
You said before...

15
00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:41.775
that I was a nuisance.

16
00:00:42.904 --> 00:00:45.604
You shouldn't eat with someone who's a nuisance.

17
00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:48.775
Eat with someone you like.

18
00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:50.044
I said that...

19
00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:52.985
just out of anger.

20
00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.985
Friends can sometimes...

21
00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.754
be a nuisance...

22
00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:01.854
and stuff. No?

23
00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:06.394
- Friends? - Yes, friends.

24
00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:09.694
Let's not be a boy and girl,

25
00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:11.504
but real friends.

26
00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:23.545
Okay, good. Friends.

27
00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:26.045
Buns. I'll treat you to the sweet buns you like.

28
00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:27.054
Let go.

29
00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:38.364
What?

30
00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:42.034
I saw it with my own eyes.

31
00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:44.804
Your husband and your maid...

32
00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:47.634
were looking at each other...

33
00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:51.504
with puppy eyes.

34
00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:05.455
Eun Ja, you watch...

35
00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:07.355
way too many dramas.

36
00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:08.955
No, that's not true.

37
00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.394
I saw them.

38
00:02:10.394 --> 00:02:11.964
Do Ha...

39
00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:15.364
had something happen to her parents.

40
00:02:15.464 --> 00:02:18.934
My husband went with her...

41
00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:20.304
to solve it.

42
00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:21.934
Is that what happened?

43
00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:25.274
My husband might have a bad temper,

44
00:02:25.274 --> 00:02:28.045
but he's the best in town...

45
00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:31.084
when working with hard documents.

46
00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.084
- Yes. - Yes.

47
00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.355
Eun Ja, come on.

48
00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:38.084
You should know what you're talking about.

49
00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:40.455
My husband is a penny pincher,

50
00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:44.494
so it would be too hard for him to cheat on me.

51
00:02:44.494 --> 00:02:46.225
- That's true. - Yes.

52
00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:47.235
Yes.

53
00:02:49.564 --> 00:02:52.564
Do Ha, why are you always cleaning that?

54
00:02:52.564 --> 00:02:54.404
It gets rusty.

55
00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:56.334
I have to clean it every day.

56
00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:57.605
Where did the bedpan go?

57
00:02:57.605 --> 00:02:59.144
Dad took it in.

58
00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:02.114
Your dad? What's gotten into him?

59
00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:04.985
Why weren't you careful?

60
00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.915
Don't get hurt. Don't.

61
00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:10.285
Auntie.

62
00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:12.654
Today, at Hyangcheon-dong...

63
00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:24.605
Don't complain because I'm making you...

64
00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:27.575
work on a Sunday since Chuseok is coming.

65
00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:28.904
Work properly.

66
00:03:28.904 --> 00:03:30.874
Don't make any defects.

67
00:03:30.874 --> 00:03:32.445
- Okay. - Okay.

68
00:03:32.505 --> 00:03:34.445
Give it to me.

69
00:03:40.485 --> 00:03:42.955
Because you're working on a Sunday,

70
00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:44.554
we feed you lunch and dinner,

71
00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:46.084
and we give you extra pay.

72
00:03:46.084 --> 00:03:48.795
Go and ask around.

73
00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.964
You wouldn't find a place that treats you so well.

74
00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:55.135
Gosh. Enough showing off.

75
00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:57.934
They can't work because you talk too much.

76
00:03:57.934 --> 00:04:00.505
I'm busy. Why are you screaming after going out?

77
00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:02.535
I came back really fast.

78
00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:04.445
I didn't even have jajangmyeon.

79
00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:06.075
Why now?

80
00:04:06.344 --> 00:04:07.975
You should have had one if you pay for membership.

81
00:04:07.975 --> 00:04:11.084
Everyone! I'll make pork...

82
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.885
for dinner tonight,

83
00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:15.154
so let's do our best today.

84
00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:18.824
Pork? What pork?

85
00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:20.395
Be quiet!

86
00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:23.895
Great!

87
00:04:24.895 --> 00:04:26.425
Let's go.

88
00:04:27.364 --> 00:04:30.304
Did you go see your lover or something?

89
00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.804
You're in such a good mood.

90
00:04:32.804 --> 00:04:34.134
Excellent!

91
00:04:49.054 --> 00:04:50.085
You startled me.

92
00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:52.254
Kyo Ryun.

93
00:04:53.595 --> 00:04:55.954
What do you need today?

94
00:04:55.954 --> 00:04:57.194
Today...

95
00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:05.204
Shim Ae Sook.

96
00:05:06.204 --> 00:05:08.374
Why are you dressed like that?

97
00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:10.304
What about you?

98
00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:15.574
Hey, how long is it until you're done?

99
00:05:17.114 --> 00:05:18.845
Give me something for my headache.

100
00:05:18.915 --> 00:05:20.754
Let me go. She's staring at us.

101
00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:33.494
Hae Joo.

102
00:05:33.494 --> 00:05:34.764
Teacher.

103
00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:38.434
Gimbap?

104
00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:43.304
Here you go.

105
00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:46.944
How much is it?

106
00:05:47.175 --> 00:05:48.415
Don't worry about it.

107
00:05:48.944 --> 00:05:50.145
It's on me.

108
00:05:51.415 --> 00:05:52.814
Goodnight.

109
00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:58.454
What are you doing? Go.

110
00:05:59.155 --> 00:06:01.525
- Bye. - Take care.

111
00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.124
Go home!

112
00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.095
It's hectic, isn't it?

113
00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:09.095
Yes.

114
00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:18.444
Dad wanted some gimbap.

115
00:06:19.804 --> 00:06:23.175
I thought of Eng Cho while making it.

116
00:06:24.085 --> 00:06:26.715
There isn't a picnic, so why gimbap?

117
00:06:28.085 --> 00:06:29.215
A...

118
00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:31.684
picnic?

119
00:06:54.874 --> 00:06:57.785
- You made so much. - Have some.

120
00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:01.085
Do Ha, sit down and join us.

121
00:07:01.085 --> 00:07:02.415
- Okay. - Yes.

122
00:07:02.415 --> 00:07:04.525
Hurry up and eat.

123
00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:06.895
Bong Soo is going to eat all of the meat.

124
00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:08.254
Mom.

125
00:07:08.254 --> 00:07:09.525
I'll make a quick trip to the kitchen.

126
00:07:09.525 --> 00:07:11.095
Enough, enough. Sit down.

127
00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:12.425
Sit and eat.

128
00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:15.934
- Sit. - Come sit here.

129
00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:33.684
There are drinks and meat,

130
00:07:33.814 --> 00:07:35.485
but there's no music.

131
00:07:35.754 --> 00:07:37.124
Sing us a song.

132
00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:38.985
- Yes. - Wow.

133
00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:41.694
I can't sing.

134
00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:43.824
Mom, I'm a good singer.

135
00:07:43.824 --> 00:07:46.064
- Forget you. - Just be quiet.

136
00:07:46.064 --> 00:07:47.264
Sing a song!

137
00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:48.994
I can't.

138
00:07:48.994 --> 00:07:51.165
Just sing one.

139
00:07:56.704 --> 00:08:00.345
You told me you'd come to me

140
00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:04.814
When flowers bloom in spring

141
00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:10.824
Like a singing swallow

142
00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:15.655
When I go up on the hill

143
00:08:15.655 --> 00:08:19.864
The chirping cheers me up

144
00:08:19.994 --> 00:08:26.204
It's telling us that spring is coming

145
00:08:26.775 --> 00:08:30.045
However

146
00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:34.045
You haven't come back

147
00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:37.714
I'm standing on the hill

148
00:08:37.714 --> 00:08:41.255
Alone again today

149
00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:46.954
While looking at the blue sky

150
00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:51.064
I'm reminded of you

151
00:08:54.094 --> 00:08:55.464
Jin.

152
00:08:56.535 --> 00:09:00.574
Did you get to Seoul by now?

153
00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:05.405
You haven't come back

154
00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:07.474
I'm standing on the hill

155
00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:08.944
Hey.

156
00:09:09.074 --> 00:09:11.944
What are you doing here after skipping dinner?

157
00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:14.084
I don't have an appetite.

158
00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:17.554
No appetite?

159
00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:19.484
Hey.

160
00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:22.425
Do you want some money? Here.

161
00:09:22.425 --> 00:09:23.464
Did you drink?

162
00:09:23.464 --> 00:09:25.495
I had a drink. Here.

163
00:09:25.495 --> 00:09:26.995
Did something good happen?

164
00:09:27.464 --> 00:09:30.765
Your mom is having...

165
00:09:31.265 --> 00:09:33.035
an excellent day.

166
00:09:34.275 --> 00:09:36.104
However

167
00:09:36.104 --> 00:09:41.175
You haven't come back

168
00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:42.344
How lucky.

169
00:09:43.444 --> 00:09:45.145
I'm sad today.

170
00:09:46.655 --> 00:09:48.785
- Why? - You don't have to know.

171
00:09:48.785 --> 00:09:50.755
Rubbish.

172
00:09:50.755 --> 00:09:52.084
What about you?

173
00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:54.025
What good thing happened to you?

174
00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:55.895
You don't have to know either.

175
00:10:13.745 --> 00:10:14.844
Hello.

176
00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.745
I'm Bae Dong Moon from class five.

177
00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:21.915
I heard I received a registered mail.

178
00:10:22.084 --> 00:10:23.115
Hold on.

179
00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:34.035
(Son Jin)

180
00:10:34.035 --> 00:10:35.094
Son Jin?

181
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:37.204
What's this?

182
00:10:42.474 --> 00:10:43.474
Bae Dong Moon.

183
00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:45.574
Are you studying well?

184
00:10:46.275 --> 00:10:47.615
How is Jung Hee?

185
00:10:47.775 --> 00:10:49.175
Gosh.

186
00:10:50.314 --> 00:10:51.444
I'm sending you...

187
00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.885
my phone number in Seoul.

188
00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:55.615
If you...

189
00:10:56.385 --> 00:10:58.084
ever need me,

190
00:10:58.525 --> 00:10:59.885
please call me.

191
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.865
Son Jin.

192
00:11:04.094 --> 00:11:05.365
What are you doing?

193
00:11:05.995 --> 00:11:07.765
You shouldn't talk if you left.

194
00:11:32.255 --> 00:11:33.354
What now?

195
00:11:33.354 --> 00:11:34.425
Nothing.

196
00:11:35.655 --> 00:11:37.795
Why is my nose so itchy?

197
00:11:50.074 --> 00:11:52.005
Just tell me. Don't write to me.

198
00:11:52.005 --> 00:11:53.204
Look at it.

199
00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:55.415
(Son Jin)

200
00:12:00.984 --> 00:12:02.885
What do you want me to do?

201
00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:05.285
In it,

202
00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.454
there's a number for Jin's home in Seoul.

203
00:12:09.964 --> 00:12:11.265
You can refer to it,

204
00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:13.495
or throw it out.

205
00:12:14.165 --> 00:12:16.665
Let's finish here for today.

206
00:12:17.964 --> 00:12:20.635
Okay. We studied too much.

207
00:12:20.635 --> 00:12:24.074
I need to sleep now. I'm so sleepy.

208
00:12:28.175 --> 00:12:29.314
Dong Moon,

209
00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:32.484
what do you want me to do with this?

210
00:12:43.425 --> 00:12:44.665
No.

211
00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:51.765
Not this either.

212
00:12:57.474 --> 00:13:00.675
(Son Jin)

213
00:13:01.844 --> 00:13:02.974
Yes.

214
00:13:03.285 --> 00:13:05.785
He left, so I should forget him.

215
00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:08.714
Are you crazy?

216
00:13:09.984 --> 00:13:11.885
What is that?

217
00:13:12.684 --> 00:13:14.694
Why did you put away the bedpan?

218
00:13:14.694 --> 00:13:17.495
Don't pee in the bedpan anymore.

219
00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:19.995
We have a washroom.

220
00:13:20.194 --> 00:13:21.895
Why would you pee in the room?

221
00:13:21.895 --> 00:13:24.005
- It smells bad. - It smells?

222
00:13:24.834 --> 00:13:26.804
You stood through it all these years.

223
00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:29.574
- Why now? - If you want it,

224
00:13:29.574 --> 00:13:31.204
then you can bring it down yourself.

225
00:13:31.574 --> 00:13:32.604
What?

226
00:13:33.944 --> 00:13:35.714
Hey. Hey...

227
00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:38.184
What's with her?

228
00:13:38.745 --> 00:13:40.314
How strange.

229
00:13:40.814 --> 00:13:42.084
Gosh.

230
00:13:55.365 --> 00:13:56.635
He's coming, he's coming!

231
00:13:57.035 --> 00:13:58.635
- They're coming. - What?

232
00:13:58.665 --> 00:14:00.704
- He's so handsome. - Look.

233
00:14:01.474 --> 00:14:04.045
- Is he human? - He's so hot.

234
00:14:04.474 --> 00:14:05.675
I'm dying.

235
00:14:06.175 --> 00:14:07.844
- Me too. - Seriously.

236
00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:09.375
Jung Hee.

237
00:14:11.615 --> 00:14:12.615
Yes?

238
00:14:15.615 --> 00:14:17.385
Did something happen?

239
00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:21.495
We did well on our exam, but you weren't happy.

240
00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:25.895
Is it because of Jin?

241
00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:28.564
No, it's not because of him.

242
00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:34.334
When I was 10,

243
00:14:35.704 --> 00:14:38.104
my mom passed away.

244
00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:40.275
She was really sick.

245
00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:42.775
My mom told me this.

246
00:14:43.314 --> 00:14:46.415
If you fall in love, you become brave.

247
00:14:47.285 --> 00:14:49.854
I didn't know what she meant back then,

248
00:14:49.854 --> 00:14:53.354
but I think I'm starting to understand her.

249
00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:56.925
You become brave when you fall in love?

250
00:14:56.964 --> 00:14:58.064
Yes.

251
00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:01.865
Jung Hee,

252
00:15:02.594 --> 00:15:05.765
if I had someone I desperately missed,

253
00:15:06.265 --> 00:15:07.405
I'd go and see them.

254
00:15:08.535 --> 00:15:11.005
It wouldn't matter where they are.

255
00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:19.385
No matter where they are?

256
00:15:20.354 --> 00:15:21.454
Yes.

257
00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:31.295
You become brave when you fall in love?

258
00:15:33.535 --> 00:15:34.635
That means...

259
00:15:36.665 --> 00:15:38.635
I shouldn't stand through this heartache.

260
00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:48.115
(Son Jin)

261
00:15:50.745 --> 00:15:51.984
Auntie.

262
00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:54.354
Please, just this once.

263
00:15:54.714 --> 00:15:56.484
Your mom will be mad if she finds out.

264
00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:58.125
It's Saturday tomorrow,

265
00:15:58.125 --> 00:15:59.625
so tell her I'm at Eun Ja's.

266
00:15:59.724 --> 00:16:02.525
All you have to do is stop her from calling.

267
00:16:02.854 --> 00:16:06.025
I'm going to be right back after seeing Jin.

268
00:16:06.224 --> 00:16:08.194
Please, Auntie.

269
00:16:10.104 --> 00:16:11.234
Fine.

270
00:16:12.064 --> 00:16:14.204
However, you have to be careful.

271
00:16:14.275 --> 00:16:16.275
Auntie, thank you.

272
00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:17.875
You're the best.

273
00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:19.505
What should I wear?

274
00:16:29.385 --> 00:16:30.454
Jin.

275
00:16:30.885 --> 00:16:33.454
I'm finally coming to see you.

276
00:16:33.724 --> 00:16:34.925
Please wait for me.

277
00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:50.745
Jung Hee, they say...

278
00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.875
Seoul is full of crooks.

279
00:16:53.515 --> 00:16:55.214
Be careful at all times,

280
00:16:55.775 --> 00:16:58.385
and especially of cars and people.

281
00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:00.454
From Auntie.

282
00:17:27.415 --> 00:17:30.284
Jung Hee, stay focused.

283
00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:33.415
Don't lose your nose.

284
00:17:37.954 --> 00:17:39.994
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

285
00:17:40.155 --> 00:17:42.024
- I'm okay. Are you? - I'm sorry.

286
00:17:42.555 --> 00:17:44.825
- Yes. I'm sorry. - No problem.

287
00:17:49.565 --> 00:17:50.704
Jung Hee...

288
00:17:52.335 --> 00:17:54.734
- went to a friend's? - Yes.

289
00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:56.774
You can go and study.

290
00:17:57.044 --> 00:17:59.905
Did she go to Seoul?

291
00:18:12.784 --> 00:18:13.825
My wallet.

292
00:18:54.065 --> 00:18:55.934
Why isn't anyone picking up?

293
00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:02.875
How many calls are you making?

294
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.345
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:18.885 --> 00:19:21.155
Son Jin, why aren't you picking up?

296
00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.494
How frustrating.

297
00:19:27.635 --> 00:19:29.264
(Son Jin's Seoul contact)

298
00:19:34.504 --> 00:19:37.704
I'm hungry, but I don't have money.

299
00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:42.514
Steamed buns.

300
00:19:43.514 --> 00:19:44.714
They look good.

301
00:19:44.784 --> 00:19:48.115
Dong Moon likes steamed buns.

302
00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:53.555
Jung Hee.

303
00:19:54.024 --> 00:19:55.095
Dong Moon!

304
00:20:05.934 --> 00:20:07.335
Is it because I'm hungry?

305
00:20:08.075 --> 00:20:10.444
Why am I thinking about Dong Moon?

306
00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:18.514
Yes?

307
00:20:20.885 --> 00:20:21.954
Dong Moon.

308
00:20:24.024 --> 00:20:25.155
Jung Hee?

309
00:20:26.585 --> 00:20:28.024
She didn't come here.

310
00:20:45.375 --> 00:20:47.345
I think it's somewhere around here.

311
00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:53.555
What do I do? The last bus already left.

312
00:21:01.694 --> 00:21:02.895
No.

313
00:21:04.165 --> 00:21:07.565
If I turn back now, walking around Seoul...

314
00:21:08.264 --> 00:21:11.004
would have been useless.

315
00:21:14.575 --> 00:21:16.175
It's all or nothing.

316
00:21:24.645 --> 00:21:26.954
Excuse me, where are you going?

317
00:21:27.484 --> 00:21:30.085
- What is it? - You're from out of town?

318
00:21:31.284 --> 00:21:32.855
- Let's hang out. - What are you doing?

319
00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:33.994
I don't want to!

320
00:21:33.994 --> 00:21:35.954
- Come with us. - Let go!

321
00:21:35.954 --> 00:21:37.724
- Let go! - Come on.

322
00:21:39.925 --> 00:21:41.665
- What is it? - Who are you?

323
00:21:43.335 --> 00:21:44.635
Jin.

324
00:21:49.734 --> 00:21:51.305
They're doing raids for long hair over there.

325
00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.645
Darn it.

326
00:22:01.915 --> 00:22:03.115
Jin.

327
00:22:11.665 --> 00:22:13.125
Why are you here?

328
00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:15.994
Do you know how dangerous Seoul is?

329
00:22:16.264 --> 00:22:19.165
Because I wanted to see you.

330
00:22:21.004 --> 00:22:22.004
I mean...

331
00:22:22.575 --> 00:22:24.944
I missed you and wanted to see you,

332
00:22:25.805 --> 00:22:27.944
so I wanted to check if my feelings were real.

333
00:22:35.115 --> 00:22:36.115
So?

334
00:22:37.284 --> 00:22:38.284
Did you?

335
00:22:40.994 --> 00:22:42.194
I'm not sure.

336
00:22:42.855 --> 00:22:43.865
What?

337
00:22:47.095 --> 00:22:48.165
Nothing.

338
00:22:49.335 --> 00:22:50.934
Now that I saw you,

339
00:22:51.964 --> 00:22:53.405
I'll leave.

340
00:22:53.835 --> 00:22:56.204
It'll be curfew soon.

341
00:22:58.905 --> 00:23:00.514
The last train left already.

342
00:23:01.115 --> 00:23:02.214
How will you go home?

343
00:23:03.845 --> 00:23:06.415
A relative lives nearby.

344
00:23:08.385 --> 00:23:09.385
For real?

345
00:23:10.984 --> 00:23:11.984
Yes.

346
00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:14.524
Okay, then.

347
00:23:15.194 --> 00:23:17.125
Take care.

348
00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:19.865
Bye.

349
00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:27.474
Whatever.

350
00:23:27.875 --> 00:23:30.105
I'll sleep at the police station.

351
00:23:30.544 --> 00:23:33.544
I don't want to depend on him.

352
00:23:33.575 --> 00:23:34.744
Jung Hee.

353
00:23:38.415 --> 00:23:39.615
Jung Hee.

354
00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.155
Seriously, Jung Hee.

355
00:23:44.724 --> 00:23:45.954
Where are you?

356
00:23:47.395 --> 00:23:48.395
But...

357
00:23:48.724 --> 00:23:51.665
why is Seoul so empty?

358
00:23:56.335 --> 00:23:57.335
What's that?

359
00:23:58.135 --> 00:23:59.504
Is it curfew already?

360
00:24:06.675 --> 00:24:07.774
Jung Hee.

361
00:24:10.044 --> 00:24:11.345
Jung Hee.

362
00:24:16.085 --> 00:24:17.684
Why are you out after curfew?

363
00:24:19.855 --> 00:24:22.024
Sirs. I...

364
00:24:22.395 --> 00:24:25.194
I'm looking for a friend.

365
00:24:44.214 --> 00:24:46.044
You can't spend the night at a police station.

366
00:24:47.585 --> 00:24:48.915
Jin.

367
00:24:55.454 --> 00:24:56.454
Come on.

368
00:25:21.855 --> 00:25:24.385
This is my uncle's house.

369
00:25:25.585 --> 00:25:26.794
They went to Daegu...

370
00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:28.555
for a banquet.

371
00:25:28.754 --> 00:25:30.694
They'll be back tomorrow, luckily.

372
00:25:33.294 --> 00:25:34.434
Luckily?

373
00:25:37.305 --> 00:25:38.934
Not luckily.

374
00:25:40.704 --> 00:25:41.734
Coincidentally.

375
00:25:51.645 --> 00:25:52.815
Are you hungry?

376
00:25:53.044 --> 00:25:54.055
No.

377
00:25:54.615 --> 00:25:57.484
I ate lunch on the bus.

378
00:25:57.484 --> 00:26:00.024
Lunch was so long ago.

379
00:26:00.595 --> 00:26:02.595
You said you walked here from the bus terminal.

380
00:26:08.434 --> 00:26:09.434
Okay.

381
00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:10.905
I made three.

382
00:26:11.365 --> 00:26:12.434
Eat up.

383
00:26:24.615 --> 00:26:26.585
Eat more. Like this.

384
00:26:31.825 --> 00:26:32.825
See?

385
00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:34.625
Okay.

386
00:26:40.835 --> 00:26:41.835
Is it good?

387
00:26:44.565 --> 00:26:45.865
It's strange.

388
00:26:46.105 --> 00:26:48.575
I like instant noodles more than anything.

389
00:26:48.575 --> 00:26:50.405
Why does it taste so bad?

390
00:26:55.575 --> 00:26:56.645
Is it good?

391
00:26:57.444 --> 00:26:58.444
Yes.

392
00:27:00.014 --> 00:27:01.585
Why is Dong Moon...

393
00:27:07.794 --> 00:27:09.325
To study abroad?

394
00:27:10.724 --> 00:27:12.065
Why so suddenly...

395
00:27:14.464 --> 00:27:15.694
My father wanted me...

396
00:27:16.905 --> 00:27:18.704
to go to Seoul University.

397
00:27:19.704 --> 00:27:22.305
But with my grades recently,

398
00:27:23.474 --> 00:27:25.145
he thinks it'll be difficult,

399
00:27:26.615 --> 00:27:27.774
so he wants to send me abroad.

400
00:27:28.474 --> 00:27:29.544
And you?

401
00:27:30.444 --> 00:27:32.415
Do you want to go?

402
00:27:41.055 --> 00:27:42.055
Jung Hee.

403
00:27:45.194 --> 00:27:46.224
You thought...

404
00:27:47.434 --> 00:27:49.135
really highly of me.

405
00:27:51.305 --> 00:27:52.365
But you know,

406
00:27:54.734 --> 00:27:55.805
I'm a loser.

407
00:27:56.605 --> 00:27:57.675
You didn't know, right?

408
00:27:58.645 --> 00:28:00.014
No.

409
00:28:00.175 --> 00:28:02.474
No. You are...

410
00:28:04.244 --> 00:28:05.484
Thanks, Jung Hee,

411
00:28:07.254 --> 00:28:08.585
for liking me.

412
00:28:17.325 --> 00:28:18.325
That's right.

413
00:28:18.865 --> 00:28:20.194
Dong Moon...

414
00:28:21.135 --> 00:28:22.565
was very worried about you.

415
00:28:23.264 --> 00:28:24.434
He was?

416
00:28:24.764 --> 00:28:25.764
That's right.

417
00:28:26.534 --> 00:28:28.434
Maybe you should call him.

418
00:28:29.434 --> 00:28:31.444
Do you know his number?

419
00:28:33.105 --> 00:28:34.115
But then again,

420
00:28:35.474 --> 00:28:37.585
it's too late to call.

421
00:28:43.184 --> 00:28:46.184
I'm dead if Mom and Dad find out.

422
00:28:54.635 --> 00:28:58.065
Jung Hee is sleeping over at Eun Ja's house?

423
00:28:58.565 --> 00:28:59.835
Yes.

424
00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:05.875
Auntie.

425
00:29:07.014 --> 00:29:08.974
I didn't think of you as a liar.

426
00:29:28.665 --> 00:29:29.865
It may be uncomfortable,

427
00:29:30.964 --> 00:29:32.105
but sleep well.

428
00:29:33.065 --> 00:29:34.335
What about you?

429
00:29:34.504 --> 00:29:35.605
I can...

430
00:29:36.105 --> 00:29:37.544
sleep in the living room.

431
00:29:40.675 --> 00:29:41.744
Good night.

432
00:29:50.585 --> 00:29:51.585
Go to bed.

433
00:29:52.984 --> 00:29:53.994
Okay.

434
00:30:18.944 --> 00:30:20.184
Does Jin...

435
00:30:20.915 --> 00:30:22.415
wear glasses?

436
00:30:25.585 --> 00:30:29.294
Dong Moon would look good with glasses like these.

437
00:30:37.234 --> 00:30:39.135
What's my problem?

438
00:30:45.444 --> 00:30:49.274
He must be worried about me.

439

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

440
00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.635
You can't sleep?

441
00:31:12.865 --> 00:31:13.905
No.

442
00:31:14.605 --> 00:31:15.835
I'm sleeping.

443
00:31:16.434 --> 00:31:18.145
Then how are you talking?

444
00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:23.214
Go to sleep.

445
00:31:24.145 --> 00:31:25.784
I'll sing you a lullaby.

446
00:31:34.055 --> 00:31:36.194
Oh Danny Boy

447
00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:39.994
The pipes, the pipes

448
00:31:40.635 --> 00:31:42.865
Are calling

449
00:31:44.034 --> 00:31:46.504
From glen to glen

450
00:31:47.974 --> 00:31:51.774
And down the mountain side

451
00:31:52.845 --> 00:31:54.145
Punks.

452
00:31:54.444 --> 00:31:56.514
The summer's gone

453
00:31:58.115 --> 00:32:02.284
And all the roses falling

454
00:32:05.085 --> 00:32:06.184
Jung Hee.

455
00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.825
Where are you?

456
00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.325
I hope you're okay.

457
00:32:15.964 --> 00:32:18.805
I got a strange feeling...

458
00:32:18.805 --> 00:32:20.504
at that moment.

459
00:32:21.605 --> 00:32:24.444
My first love, Jin.

460
00:32:25.044 --> 00:32:26.944
I missed him so badly...

461
00:32:28.315 --> 00:32:31.444
that it made me rush up to Seoul.

462
00:32:31.845 --> 00:32:33.044
Jin.

463
00:32:33.355 --> 00:32:36.214
But did I really...

464
00:32:36.284 --> 00:32:39.055
in fact like him?

465
00:32:41.555 --> 00:32:44.964
I'm with Jin right now,

466
00:32:45.865 --> 00:32:48.464
so why do I feel empty?

467
00:32:51.204 --> 00:32:52.405
It's strange.

468
00:32:53.534 --> 00:32:55.335
Why am I so confused?

469
00:33:30.774 --> 00:33:31.875
Hae Joo.

470
00:33:34.845 --> 00:33:35.974
I love you.

471
00:33:37.044 --> 00:33:38.184
Mister.

472
00:33:39.115 --> 00:33:42.085
Should we run away?

473
00:33:44.224 --> 00:33:45.754
Somewhere no one can find us?

474
00:33:47.055 --> 00:33:48.155
Yes,

475
00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:50.625
let's go.

476
00:33:52.194 --> 00:33:53.794
Let's go far away.

477
00:33:55.335 --> 00:33:57.734
Okay. Just trust me.

478
00:34:00.105 --> 00:34:01.135
Let's go.

479
00:34:52.425 --> 00:34:53.624
Young Choon.

480
00:34:54.524 --> 00:34:56.055
Face reality.

481
00:34:57.725 --> 00:34:59.064
This is wrong.

482
00:35:00.564 --> 00:35:02.535
If you truly love Hae Joo,

483
00:35:04.664 --> 00:35:06.035
you can't do this.

484
00:35:17.785 --> 00:35:20.814
Thank you for everything.

485
00:35:21.754 --> 00:35:25.584
Study hard and bring up your grades during finals.

486
00:35:26.484 --> 00:35:27.524
Okay?

487
00:35:29.055 --> 00:35:30.064
Okay.

488
00:35:31.825 --> 00:35:33.024
- And... - And...

489
00:35:37.265 --> 00:35:38.365
You first.

490
00:35:38.664 --> 00:35:39.834
And...

491
00:35:41.374 --> 00:35:45.004
you are definitely not a loser.

492
00:35:46.714 --> 00:35:48.975
When you said that last night...

493
00:35:50.914 --> 00:35:53.285
You're really cool...

494
00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:56.484
and a brave person.

495
00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:04.964
What were you about to say?

496
00:36:13.064 --> 00:36:14.175
I was happy...

497
00:36:16.604 --> 00:36:17.745
that you came.

498
00:36:26.444 --> 00:36:28.314
The bus to Daegu is leaving!

499
00:36:32.655 --> 00:36:33.754
Go on.

500
00:36:36.925 --> 00:36:37.995
Okay.

501
00:36:40.564 --> 00:36:42.095
Goodbye.

502
00:36:46.135 --> 00:36:47.175
Jung Hee.

503
00:36:57.785 --> 00:36:58.885
I'll see you again.

504
00:37:13.294 --> 00:37:16.334
I couldn't sleep last night. I'm tired.

505
00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:25.705
You...

506
00:37:38.254 --> 00:37:40.555
Where are your glasses?

507
00:37:41.995 --> 00:37:43.155
I lost them.

508
00:37:47.694 --> 00:37:49.635
Where did you sleep last night?

509
00:37:52.205 --> 00:37:53.234
At a relative's.

510
00:37:55.705 --> 00:37:58.444
What a tearful parting.

511
00:37:58.874 --> 00:38:01.175
I thought you were filming a movie.

512
00:38:01.714 --> 00:38:02.814
What?

513
00:38:05.984 --> 00:38:08.984
Why did you tell me Jin's address...

514
00:38:09.084 --> 00:38:10.484
if you were going to do this?

515
00:38:13.595 --> 00:38:14.725
Because...

516
00:38:16.865 --> 00:38:18.365
you were hurt.

517
00:38:20.964 --> 00:38:22.564
I'd rather hurt...

518
00:38:24.564 --> 00:38:26.405
than have you hurting.

519
00:38:36.544 --> 00:38:37.745
I'm hungry.

520
00:38:39.785 --> 00:38:41.483
I got it at the terminal.

521
00:38:41.508 --> 00:38:43.079
I don't know if it's good.

522
00:38:43.285 --> 00:38:44.425
You...

523
00:38:45.584 --> 00:38:47.394
ate with Jin, right?

524
00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:48.825
I'm going to eat my breakfast.

525
00:39:11.484 --> 00:39:12.615
Did you starve?

526
00:39:13.714 --> 00:39:15.155
Jin didn't even feed you?

527
00:39:15.914 --> 00:39:17.155
It's strange,

528
00:39:17.754 --> 00:39:19.925
but I don't like Seoul food.

529
00:39:28.294 --> 00:39:30.104
It's so strange.

530
00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:34.205
Why does everything taste so good with Dong Moon?

531
00:39:44.584 --> 00:39:45.615
Are you okay?

532
00:39:47.414 --> 00:39:48.914
Eat slowly.

533
00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:18.544
- Are you happy? - Yes.

534
00:40:18.944 --> 00:40:21.555
I'm so very happy. I love picnics.

535
00:40:26.225 --> 00:40:27.825
Come sit down.

536
00:40:35.995 --> 00:40:38.635
Sit here. You'll get bit.

537
00:40:39.305 --> 00:40:40.405
I'm fine.

538
00:40:44.745 --> 00:40:46.305
That stings.

539
00:40:52.644 --> 00:40:54.515
Do you like gimbap?

540
00:40:59.055 --> 00:41:00.225
Yummy.

541
00:41:02.055 --> 00:41:03.365
Chew properly.

542
00:41:18.575 --> 00:41:19.575
It tastes good.

543
00:41:32.524 --> 00:41:34.825
You heard the rumors, right?

544
00:41:36.155 --> 00:41:38.694
That Eng Cho is my child and stuff.

545
00:41:40.794 --> 00:41:41.794
Yes.

546
00:41:42.694 --> 00:41:43.705
What?

547
00:41:45.435 --> 00:41:46.834
You really did?

548
00:41:48.334 --> 00:41:49.405
Yes.

549
00:41:54.175 --> 00:41:55.675
That's...

550
00:41:56.575 --> 00:41:58.115
all nonsense.

551
00:41:58.544 --> 00:42:00.214
She isn't my child.

552
00:42:01.254 --> 00:42:02.885
She's really my sister.

553
00:42:04.725 --> 00:42:05.825
I know.

554
00:42:06.925 --> 00:42:09.455
You said before that she was your sister.

555
00:42:10.725 --> 00:42:11.725
Still,

556
00:42:12.464 --> 00:42:13.935
if people keep saying...

557
00:42:13.935 --> 00:42:16.635
If that's what you say, that's what it is.

558
00:42:17.734 --> 00:42:19.705
I believe only what you say.

559
00:42:28.175 --> 00:42:30.345
Don't believe a punk like me.

560
00:42:31.285 --> 00:42:32.615
I'm a thug...

561
00:42:32.885 --> 00:42:33.984
and uneducated.

562
00:42:34.354 --> 00:42:35.555
I'm going to believe you.

563
00:42:47.194 --> 00:42:48.265
Hae Joo.

564
00:42:48.794 --> 00:42:50.135
Isn't this pretty?

565
00:42:52.765 --> 00:42:55.475
Young Choon made it for me.

566
00:42:55.475 --> 00:42:57.104
How pretty.

567
00:43:16.495 --> 00:43:18.564
Thank you, mister.

568
00:43:18.964 --> 00:43:20.365
I told you, I'm not a "mister".

569
00:43:24.365 --> 00:43:27.075
Eng Cho. Let's tour Seoul.

570
00:44:17.155 --> 00:44:18.825
He finally got him.

571
00:44:18.825 --> 00:44:21.294
As soon as he gets up, he head-butts him.

572
00:44:21.624 --> 00:44:23.995
Head-butt. Yes.

573
00:44:30.064 --> 00:44:34.035
- Mom. - You stayed at Eun Ja's?

574
00:44:34.035 --> 00:44:36.944
- Yes. - You must've had fun.

575
00:44:37.104 --> 00:44:38.604
You're all smiles.

576
00:44:40.075 --> 00:44:41.414
I'll go to my room.

577
00:44:43.245 --> 00:44:44.345
You brat.

578
00:44:48.814 --> 00:44:49.814
What?

579
00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:58.595
Have you no fear? You went to Seoul?

580
00:44:59.925 --> 00:45:02.194
How could you go there?

581
00:45:05.964 --> 00:45:08.004
- How? - Does Father know?

582
00:45:08.004 --> 00:45:09.104
Father?

583
00:45:11.245 --> 00:45:12.444
So,

584
00:45:14.314 --> 00:45:16.515
you fear your father,

585
00:45:20.785 --> 00:45:21.854
but...

586
00:45:24.885 --> 00:45:26.055
your mom...

587
00:45:27.294 --> 00:45:28.825
is nothing?

588
00:45:29.254 --> 00:45:30.265
Is that it?

589
00:45:30.524 --> 00:45:31.524
Look.

590
00:45:31.694 --> 00:45:35.435
What would you have done if your father...

591
00:45:35.435 --> 00:45:37.905
wasn't at a funeral last night?

592
00:45:40.405 --> 00:45:41.604
He doesn't know?

593
00:45:42.435 --> 00:45:43.475
No.

594
00:45:43.975 --> 00:45:45.444
Your father doesn't know.

595
00:45:45.905 --> 00:45:46.975
Happy?

596
00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:48.615
Are you happy, you brat?

597
00:45:48.615 --> 00:45:52.515
You must be happy because your father doesn't know.

598
00:45:52.515 --> 00:45:54.615
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

599
00:45:56.214 --> 00:45:57.925
You too.

600
00:45:59.754 --> 00:46:01.925
You're an adult.

601
00:46:02.495 --> 00:46:05.694
How could you scheme with a kid and deceive me?

602
00:46:06.265 --> 00:46:07.435
What else...

603
00:46:08.664 --> 00:46:11.435
are you deceiving me about?

604
00:46:12.504 --> 00:46:14.004
What else...

605
00:46:14.475 --> 00:46:16.435
did you deceive me about?

606
00:46:17.444 --> 00:46:18.575
Tell me!

607
00:46:18.644 --> 00:46:21.274
Mom, I'm sorry.

608
00:46:21.274 --> 00:46:23.214
Apologize to your father.

609
00:46:23.214 --> 00:46:24.745
Why are you apologizing to me?

610
00:46:24.745 --> 00:46:27.455
Your mom... Your mom is a moron.

611
00:46:27.455 --> 00:46:29.615
Why are you apologizing to me?

612
00:46:29.615 --> 00:46:31.325
- Mom! - Please forgive us.

613
00:46:31.325 --> 00:46:34.024
Mom! Stop it! You'll kill her!

614
00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:37.865
You know how much I trusted you.

615
00:46:39.294 --> 00:46:41.794
How could you lie to me...

616
00:46:41.794 --> 00:46:43.435
and stab me in the back?

617
00:46:43.435 --> 00:46:44.905
You brat!

618
00:46:44.905 --> 00:46:47.274
How could you do that to me?

619
00:46:47.274 --> 00:46:49.274
Let go. Let go!

620
00:46:49.874 --> 00:46:51.305
Let go!

621
00:46:53.245 --> 00:46:54.475
What's going on here?

622
00:46:56.515 --> 00:46:57.515
Hey.

623
00:46:58.984 --> 00:47:01.484
Why this old woman... You took on three?

624
00:47:01.484 --> 00:47:02.685
Are you a fighter?

625
00:47:03.214 --> 00:47:05.254
Are you?

626
00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:11.194
What?

627
00:47:12.425 --> 00:47:14.265
Are you glaring at me?

628
00:47:15.194 --> 00:47:16.194
Are you?

629
00:47:18.865 --> 00:47:21.374
Did you just glare at me?

630
00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:26.245
Look at her. Look at her being arrogant.

631
00:47:29.745 --> 00:47:31.615
What did you do wrong this time?

632
00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:32.814
It's nothing.

633
00:47:32.814 --> 00:47:34.185
Nothing? Then...

634
00:47:35.484 --> 00:47:38.185
Jung Hee. Did you get into trouble again?

635
00:47:38.984 --> 00:47:41.325
No. Definitely not.

636
00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:43.325
Look at that brat.

637
00:47:45.495 --> 00:47:46.865
Are you hurt?

638
00:47:46.865 --> 00:47:48.834
No, I'm fine.

639
00:47:50.535 --> 00:47:52.234
Seriously.

640
00:48:02.015 --> 00:48:04.044
What's with you lately?

641
00:48:04.785 --> 00:48:07.584
Did something go wrong at your gathering?

642
00:48:09.655 --> 00:48:11.155
No, it did not.

643
00:48:13.185 --> 00:48:14.754
Look at her.

644
00:48:15.254 --> 00:48:16.765
Her master is talking,

645
00:48:16.765 --> 00:48:18.664
but she doesn't even look.

646
00:48:20.535 --> 00:48:22.865
Master? How are you my master?

647
00:48:23.464 --> 00:48:24.504
Then what?

648
00:48:24.964 --> 00:48:28.635
Are you the master of the house and I am...

649
00:48:28.635 --> 00:48:29.975
the servant or something?

650
00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.175
What is wrong with you?

651
00:48:34.814 --> 00:48:36.075
Forget it. Stop it.

652
00:48:37.444 --> 00:48:39.845
What? You slept over?

653
00:48:39.845 --> 00:48:41.814
You slept in Jin's room?

654
00:48:43.285 --> 00:48:44.754
It's so romantic.

655
00:48:44.754 --> 00:48:46.084
You must've been so happy.

656
00:48:46.084 --> 00:48:47.155
- You just slept? - Hey.

657
00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:49.225
Step aside.

658
00:48:52.425 --> 00:48:53.865
What's wrong with her?

659
00:48:53.865 --> 00:48:56.135
- Hae Joo? - That's right.

660
00:48:56.435 --> 00:48:59.734
You know that thug, Young Choon?

661
00:48:59.734 --> 00:49:00.874
- I do. - I do.

662
00:49:00.874 --> 00:49:04.305
I saw her and him laughing and smiling...

663
00:49:04.444 --> 00:49:05.544
together.

664
00:49:05.544 --> 00:49:07.774
No way.

665
00:49:08.475 --> 00:49:10.084
Seriously.

666
00:49:10.084 --> 00:49:11.385
Who...

667
00:49:13.385 --> 00:49:14.615
Hey, Gwi Ja.

668
00:49:15.785 --> 00:49:18.955
I told you not to run your big mouth, right?

669
00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:21.254
What did I do?

670
00:49:21.754 --> 00:49:24.765
I only spoke the truth about what I saw.

671
00:49:25.124 --> 00:49:28.435
They brought the kid and swung their arms,

672
00:49:28.435 --> 00:49:29.964
having fun.

673
00:49:29.964 --> 00:49:31.664
What? A kid?

674
00:49:31.664 --> 00:49:32.664
Yes.

675
00:49:33.274 --> 00:49:34.274
Hae Joo.

676
00:49:36.135 --> 00:49:37.805
Do you have a kid?

677
00:49:39.374 --> 00:49:40.374
What?

678
00:49:42.274 --> 00:49:43.414
Hey, Hae Joo.

679
00:49:45.345 --> 00:49:46.444
Didn't I...

680
00:49:47.314 --> 00:49:50.785
tell you to stay away from Young Choon?

681
00:49:52.524 --> 00:49:54.354
Do you like him?

682
00:49:56.394 --> 00:49:57.964
Hae Joo, let's go.

683
00:50:00.765 --> 00:50:02.064
Do you like him?

684
00:50:03.035 --> 00:50:04.035
Yes,

685
00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:06.504
I like him.

686
00:50:06.905 --> 00:50:09.274
- She's lost her mind. - Oh my gosh.

687
00:50:09.274 --> 00:50:10.944
It's true.

688
00:50:10.944 --> 00:50:12.504
Why you...

689
00:50:12.504 --> 00:50:15.175
- Hey! - Stop!

690
00:50:15.175 --> 00:50:16.714
Freeze!

691
00:50:18.385 --> 00:50:24.124
Freeze!

692
00:50:34.635 --> 00:50:37.405
Do you think the classroom is a place for sparring?

693
00:50:37.405 --> 00:50:39.464
How dare you fight here?

694
00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.305
Hae Joo, that witch,

695
00:50:42.734 --> 00:50:44.774
keeps hitting on Young Choon.

696
00:50:44.774 --> 00:50:47.644
Ae Sook. Don't make accusations like that.

697
00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:49.845
You're jealous too. Don't pretend.

698
00:50:49.845 --> 00:50:51.984
Hae Joo and Young Choon are...

699
00:50:52.144 --> 00:50:53.685
Ae Sook.

700
00:50:56.685 --> 00:50:57.754
All of you,

701
00:50:58.825 --> 00:51:00.055
turn around.

702
00:51:06.064 --> 00:51:08.064
You're wearing strappy undershirts?

703
00:51:08.495 --> 00:51:11.265
Don't you know they're banned?

704
00:51:12.135 --> 00:51:14.175
Darn it.

705
00:51:14.175 --> 00:51:17.374
Why is she suddenly complaining about it?

706
00:51:17.745 --> 00:51:19.444
She's just jealous.

707
00:51:24.185 --> 00:51:25.285
Move it.

708
00:51:27.455 --> 00:51:29.354
Let's clean quietly.

709
00:51:29.455 --> 00:51:31.484
I don't want to run laps again.

710
00:51:41.464 --> 00:51:44.135
The early morning rain

711
00:51:44.265 --> 00:51:46.164
Wets the rails

712
00:51:53.814 --> 00:51:55.975
The early morning rain

713
00:51:56.015 --> 00:51:58.015
Wets the roof

714
00:52:00.214 --> 00:52:02.214
It leaves an echo

715
00:52:02.254 --> 00:52:05.825
And it really leaves

716
00:52:08.555 --> 00:52:12.265
The early morning rain wets the rails

717
00:52:13.024 --> 00:52:15.435
Dong Moon is on probation?

718
00:52:15.435 --> 00:52:19.234
That's right. A police station from Seoul called.

719
00:52:19.234 --> 00:52:21.475
He was caught violating curfew.

720
00:52:24.305 --> 00:52:26.814
So he has to write apologies after school...

721
00:52:27.175 --> 00:52:29.944
and can't tutor us for a while.

722
00:52:38.354 --> 00:52:39.555
Dong Moon.

723
00:52:42.955 --> 00:52:44.794
Why didn't you tell me...

724
00:52:45.325 --> 00:52:47.365
you were at the police station?

725
00:52:48.664 --> 00:52:51.104
Bong Soo, that punk. I said not to tell.

726
00:52:53.535 --> 00:52:54.675
Go.

727
00:52:55.205 --> 00:52:57.745
Sorry. It's my fault.

728
00:52:59.305 --> 00:53:02.175
No need. I'm the one that went after you.

729
00:53:02.774 --> 00:53:03.944
I was an idiot.

730
00:53:05.345 --> 00:53:07.955
Still, I'm sorry.

731
00:53:08.414 --> 00:53:11.725
You need to act in order to learn.

732
00:53:12.655 --> 00:53:14.354
That's what my dad said.

733
00:53:15.024 --> 00:53:16.294
He was right.

734
00:53:17.164 --> 00:53:18.664
I had to do something stupid...

735
00:53:19.564 --> 00:53:21.935
to learn what can't be, can't be.

736
00:53:23.194 --> 00:53:24.365
Get home safely.

737
00:53:29.475 --> 00:53:30.675
Dong Moon!

738
00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:38.544
Jung Hee.

739
00:53:42.084 --> 00:53:43.325
How heartbreaking.

740
00:53:48.194 --> 00:53:49.794
Do you like Jin that much?

741
00:53:59.365 --> 00:54:00.504
Young Choon?

742
00:54:00.935 --> 00:54:02.004
Yes.

743
00:54:02.004 --> 00:54:04.944
You know that Seoul girl, Park Hae Joo?

744
00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:06.245
The professor's daughter.

745
00:54:07.015 --> 00:54:10.385
I hear they're going around dating.

746
00:54:11.185 --> 00:54:12.885
Everyone in town...

747
00:54:13.185 --> 00:54:15.414
is talking about it.

748
00:54:15.414 --> 00:54:16.484
Really?

749
00:54:18.984 --> 00:54:21.725
What was that? Who's dating? Us?

750
00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:24.624
Do you think that arrogant Seoul girl...

751
00:54:24.925 --> 00:54:26.935
would give me a second thought?

752
00:54:26.935 --> 00:54:28.595
Right? No, right?

753
00:54:30.035 --> 00:54:31.604
I told you.

754
00:54:36.435 --> 00:54:37.604
Mister.

755
00:54:41.374 --> 00:54:42.675
Hello, miss.

756
00:54:45.414 --> 00:54:49.015
The professor needs the chimney fixed, right?

757
00:54:50.584 --> 00:54:51.655
Let's go.

758
00:54:54.524 --> 00:54:55.595
You're leaving?

759
00:54:57.064 --> 00:54:58.194
Where to?

760
00:54:59.294 --> 00:55:02.595
There's a job opening in Busan.

761
00:55:03.504 --> 00:55:04.604
So...

762
00:55:06.205 --> 00:55:07.435
don't talk to me...

763
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:09.675
until I leave.

764
00:55:10.104 --> 00:55:11.575
Don't look at me either.

765
00:55:11.905 --> 00:55:13.675
That's not right.

766
00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:17.484
You're doing this because people are talking, right?

767
00:55:17.944 --> 00:55:20.285
Who cares what people think?

768
00:55:22.414 --> 00:55:25.325
Regardless. Don't come to the pharmacy anymore...

769
00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:27.495
either.

770
00:55:28.794 --> 00:55:30.624
- No. - Listen to me.

771
00:55:32.394 --> 00:55:33.495
You'll...

772
00:55:34.564 --> 00:55:35.894
regret it.

773
00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:39.104
- No. - Then what?

774
00:55:39.635 --> 00:55:40.774
No.

775
00:55:48.414 --> 00:55:49.644
Hey, Seoul Chick.

776
00:55:50.544 --> 00:55:52.685
Are you being arrogant just because...

777
00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.414
I hung out with you a little?

778
00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:58.484
You still don't get it?

779
00:56:07.595 --> 00:56:10.365
I'm not interested in you anymore.

780
00:56:38.365 --> 00:56:39.464
Dong Moon.

781
00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:42.664
Why do you keep getting on my mind?

782
00:56:57.885 --> 00:57:00.484
I'm not interested in you anymore.

783
00:57:36.084 --> 00:57:37.185
Who is it?

784
00:57:38.885 --> 00:57:40.024
What's up?

785
00:57:44.865 --> 00:57:45.925
Joo Young Choon?

786
00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:54.234
Who are you?

787
00:57:55.475 --> 00:57:56.504
- What... - Mister.

788
00:57:57.274 --> 00:57:58.805
Talk to me. Let go.

789
00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:00.615
- Stay still. - I didn't do anything.

790
00:58:01.345 --> 00:58:04.285
Wait a minute. Mister. What's going on?

791
00:58:04.785 --> 00:58:05.785
Mister.

792
00:58:09.984 --> 00:58:11.084
Mister.

793
00:58:12.854 --> 00:58:14.955
Mister.

794
00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:16.865
Mister.

795
00:58:21.694 --> 00:58:22.865
Mister.

796
00:58:39.285 --> 00:58:40.555
Guess.

797
00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:42.155
Come on.

798
00:58:44.854 --> 00:58:47.754
Okay. Let's start.

799
00:58:52.694 --> 00:58:54.234
Hae Joo isn't here yet?

800
00:58:56.294 --> 00:58:57.334
No.

801
00:58:58.234 --> 00:58:59.564
That's odd.

802
00:58:59.935 --> 00:59:01.705
No one's answering the phone.

803
00:59:02.475 --> 00:59:04.504
Okay. Page 83.

804
00:59:13.754 --> 00:59:14.814
Hae Joo!

805
00:59:16.885 --> 00:59:18.055
Hae Joo!

806
00:59:27.035 --> 00:59:28.435
Where did she go?

807
00:59:34.205 --> 00:59:36.305
Olivia won't pick up?

808
00:59:36.975 --> 00:59:38.644
- No. - Really?

809
00:59:38.874 --> 00:59:41.475
Maybe the phone is broken. Hello?

810
00:59:42.975 --> 00:59:44.015
Is it broken?

811
00:59:46.385 --> 00:59:49.084
Is Dong Moon still on probation?

812
00:59:49.084 --> 00:59:50.084
Yes.

813
00:59:50.725 --> 00:59:53.055
Gosh. That poor thing.

814
00:59:53.055 --> 00:59:55.294
I kind of miss him, don't you?

815
00:59:55.754 --> 00:59:57.794
I'm good at adding and subtracting now.

816
00:59:57.794 --> 00:59:59.765
I want to study.

817
01:00:03.705 --> 01:00:05.905
What is this uneasy feeling?

818
01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:08.334
Hae Joo and Dong Moon...

819
01:00:44.175 --> 01:00:45.274
It's raining.

820
01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:01.655
- Jung Hee. - You wrote your apology?

821
01:01:03.024 --> 01:01:04.024
I did.

822
01:01:05.964 --> 01:01:09.164
I told you not to come.

823
01:01:09.734 --> 01:01:11.265
How could I not?

824
01:01:11.805 --> 01:01:14.035
My friend was going to walk in the rain.

825
01:01:14.135 --> 01:01:16.374
- We're friends. - Friends?

826
01:01:22.714 --> 01:01:24.214
I don't want to be friends either now.

827
01:01:25.245 --> 01:01:26.285
Go home.

828
01:01:27.285 --> 01:01:29.015
You lent me your umbrella before too.

829
01:01:29.254 --> 01:01:32.785
I'm paying you back. I hate owing a debt.

830
01:01:37.124 --> 01:01:38.124
Jung Hee.

831
01:01:38.894 --> 01:01:39.894
Yes?

832
01:01:40.535 --> 01:01:41.664
Don't do this.

833
01:01:49.905 --> 01:01:51.345
Hey, Dong Moon!

834
01:01:57.584 --> 01:01:58.584
Jung Hee.

835
01:01:59.144 --> 01:02:01.484
Don't walk in the rain. You'll catch a cold.

836
01:02:02.515 --> 01:02:03.754
Don't mind me!

837
01:02:04.225 --> 01:02:06.725
Whether I get wet or catch a cold,

838
01:02:06.894 --> 01:02:08.495
what's it to you?

839
01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:10.464
You said we aren't even friends.

840
01:02:22.935 --> 01:02:25.475
(Tune in for the final episode.)
