1
00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:05.602
A thriller about a religious cult, Save Me.

2
00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:16.970
(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:18.638
(All organizations, locations, religions, and characters...)

4
00:00:18.638 --> 00:00:20.073
(in this drama are fictitious.)

5
00:00:20.073 --> 00:00:22.309
Please help me accept you with all of my heart.

6
00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.144
I need just a little more time.

7
00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:27.180
Until the day the fruit will ripen to perfection,

8
00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:28.782
I will wait.

9
00:00:28.982 --> 00:00:31.151
You should never swallow the pills Apostle Kang gives you from now on.

10
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:32.619
Listen to me if you want to save Sang Mi.

11
00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.388
I feel like there are so many devils in this place these days.

12
00:00:35.388 --> 00:00:36.423
Shove her head in there.

13
00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:40.360
Oh, yes. I remember now.

14
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.662
That place is being broadcasted on the internet these days.

15
00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.397
What do you mean?

16
00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:46.766
Oh, you used to go to a church in Daegu that just got broadcasted?

17
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.171
I bet you're now realizing whom you guys were messing with.

18
00:00:51.638 --> 00:00:54.174
I think they caught Jung Hoon and took him there.

19
00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:56.042
I think we should test Sang Mi...

20
00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.845
if she's truly capable of becoming...

21
00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:00.313
our Spiritual Mother.

22
00:01:00.313 --> 00:01:02.582
With the fire of our Almighty...

23
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.219
With his hot fire...

24
00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:09.989
Hong So Rin.

25
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:13.226
I look forward to working with you.

26
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.065
If you go that way into the forest,

27
00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:20.800
you'll get to a stream with a small bridge.

28
00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:22.869
You can meet my friend there and get help from him.

29
00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:32.345
(Episode 15)

30
00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.513
Almighty must love me very much.

31
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:10.250
I mean, who thought I'd run into you right here?

32
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:13.253
Aren't I right, Reporter Hong So Rin?

33
00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:20.393
No! Please forgive me.

34
00:02:20.627 --> 00:02:21.961
Please don't...

35
00:02:22.128 --> 00:02:23.730
Gosh... Don't kill me.

36
00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:25.398
Please don't kill me!

37
00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:29.436
No! Please don't!

38
00:02:36.676 --> 00:02:39.979
Why did you sneak into Guseonwon to begin with?

39
00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:42.682
You graduated from a good university and became a reporter.

40
00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:46.519
If your parents see this, their hearts will shatter to pieces.

41
00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:48.888
Aren't I right?

42
00:02:59.132 --> 00:03:01.534
I hope you go to the paradise and gain salvation, Ms. Reporter.

43
00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:57.390
Dong Cheol, I just got here,

44
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.727
but that reporter isn't here. Something must've happened to her.

45
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.662
I'll file a missing person report.

46
00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.632
If I report her missing, those jerks will try to bury it again.

47
00:04:06.165 --> 00:04:08.368
It might actually give us a chance to catch them.

48
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:16.142
Hello?

49
00:04:17.577 --> 00:04:18.811
Sang...

50
00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:20.813
Hwan...

51
00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:23.816
Mom?

52
00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:27.720
It's your mom.

53
00:04:42.302 --> 00:04:45.471
Are you sure that Reporter Hong escaped safely?

54
00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:48.241
Yes, but I'm worried...

55
00:04:48.508 --> 00:04:51.277
because it seems like she didn't meet Sang Hwan yet.

56
00:04:51.878 --> 00:04:55.415
For now, let's wait until he calls us.

57
00:05:22.175 --> 00:05:24.077
Excuse me.

58
00:05:24.677 --> 00:05:26.179
Spiritual Mother,

59
00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:29.048
did you see Apostle Kang today?

60
00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:30.984
What is the matter?

61
00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:34.187
She's supposed to be leading the vigil today.

62
00:05:34.187 --> 00:05:35.254
But she doesn't seem to be here.

63
00:05:36.656 --> 00:05:39.158
I'll be doing it today.

64
00:05:57.677 --> 00:05:59.178
As you all know,

65
00:06:00.613 --> 00:06:02.382
for the last three years,

66
00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:04.851
I was a sinner.

67
00:06:05.551 --> 00:06:07.353
I showed hatred...

68
00:06:07.954 --> 00:06:11.457
for the Almighty and the Spiritual Father...

69
00:06:11.457 --> 00:06:12.892
in front of you.

70
00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:15.061
- However, - Jo Wan Tae isn't here.

71
00:06:15.061 --> 00:06:16.429
the Almighty and the Spiritual Father...

72
00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:17.463
Did he...

73
00:06:17.463 --> 00:06:18.698
They chose me...

74
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.436
as the Spiritual Mother of Guseonwon.

75
00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:29.776
Brothers and Sisters of Guseonwon,

76
00:06:30.143 --> 00:06:32.245
thanks to the Almighty and the Spiritual Father,

77
00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:36.649
I have become a whole new person.

78
00:06:40.653 --> 00:06:43.389
I am so happy right now.

79
00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.158
He's wearing something different.

80
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:51.164
It's different.

81
00:06:51.164 --> 00:06:52.699
When I think of meeting the Almighty...

82
00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:55.501
next to the Spiritual Father as the Spiritual Mother,.

83
00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:57.437
my heart feels so warm...

84
00:06:58.137 --> 00:06:59.906
that I don't know what to do about it.

85
00:06:59.906 --> 00:07:01.607
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

86
00:07:01.607 --> 00:07:03.409
- We believe it. - We believe it.

87
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.080
Do you believe that I am the scapegoat...

88
00:07:07.613 --> 00:07:11.517
that will help you get rid of your original sin?

89
00:07:11.517 --> 00:07:12.985
- We believe it. - We believe it.

90
00:07:12.985 --> 00:07:14.887
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

91
00:07:14.887 --> 00:07:15.988
In that case,

92
00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:19.959
let's give a big round of applause of gratefulness...

93
00:07:20.093 --> 00:07:22.361
to the Almighty and the Spiritual Father...

94
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:26.265
who have blessed everyone here with grace.

95
00:07:42.248 --> 00:07:45.384
I need to check what he was up to.

96
00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:55.361
Man Hee, how is Jung Hoon?

97
00:07:55.361 --> 00:07:57.230
Fortunately, he's fine.

98
00:07:57.396 --> 00:07:59.899
I got the medical certificates as evidence.

99
00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:01.801
I'll go to the police station tomorrow with him.

100
00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:04.570
All right. Take good care of him today.

101
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.972
See you at the police station tomorrow.

102
00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:07.573
All right.

103
00:08:07.573 --> 00:08:08.574
Bye.

104
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.980
If we make it a big hospital with a sanatorium,

105
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.883
people will welcome it and stop opposing it.

106
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.486
This is probably what Baek Jung Ki wanted.

107
00:08:21.187 --> 00:08:23.389
If we use him wisely,

108
00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:25.658
we will be competitive with the henchman and Senator Park,

109
00:08:25.658 --> 00:08:28.227
and we will get a better chance at earning more votes.

110
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:31.631
And I think it'd be better...

111
00:08:32.064 --> 00:08:33.966
to move your wife.

112
00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.370
What do you mean?

113
00:08:37.403 --> 00:08:40.740
It seems like Sang Hwan has made a big fuss at Guseonwon.

114
00:08:40.973 --> 00:08:42.575
They called us.

115
00:08:42.575 --> 00:08:44.911
And it seems like he's been going to the police...

116
00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:47.180
and working with Detective Lee.

117
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.650
Really? I must have overlooked my son,

118
00:08:51.317 --> 00:08:53.085
thinking he was too young to do anything.

119
00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:55.521
If we get a hold of your wife,

120
00:08:56.856 --> 00:08:59.492
Sang Hwan won't be able to do anything much.

121
00:09:02.962 --> 00:09:04.897
Mom. Mom.

122
00:09:05.598 --> 00:09:06.632
Mom.

123
00:09:08.301 --> 00:09:11.103
Mom. Did you move by yourself?

124
00:09:30.456 --> 00:09:33.726
Your... father...

125
00:09:35.494 --> 00:09:37.263
Where is he?

126
00:10:12.999 --> 00:10:14.100
Man Hee.

127
00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:17.336
I need to ask you a favor.

128
00:10:18.704 --> 00:10:21.107
You just need to help me take my mom out of the hospital room...

129
00:10:21.107 --> 00:10:23.009
and take her to my uncle's.

130
00:10:23.175 --> 00:10:25.645
Okay, I will be there.

131
00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:26.812
See you later.

132
00:10:29.282 --> 00:10:30.883
What? Is there a problem?

133
00:10:30.883 --> 00:10:33.786
I need to go outside for a moment.

134
00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:35.888
Do you have time to watch over him until I come back?

135
00:10:36.856 --> 00:10:38.291
I'm late for work.

136
00:10:40.526 --> 00:10:43.129
We're only disturbing him by making noises here.

137
00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:45.097
Let him sleep well.

138
00:10:45.097 --> 00:10:46.832
Let's leave him to rest alone.

139
00:10:47.733 --> 00:10:48.801
Okay.

140
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.162
Spiritual Mother.

141
00:11:16.329 --> 00:11:17.396
Why...

142
00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:21.033
are you cleaning this room?

143
00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:24.537
Apostle Jo asked us to clean this room.

144
00:11:27.974 --> 00:11:29.508
Excuse me.

145
00:11:29.508 --> 00:11:30.509
Yes?

146
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.112
Apostle Kang is looking for you.

147
00:11:35.715 --> 00:11:37.683
It's all right. You should go.

148
00:11:37.683 --> 00:11:39.251
It seemed urgent.

149
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.322
In that case, we'll be right back.

150
00:11:43.556 --> 00:11:44.657
Yes.

151
00:11:57.236 --> 00:11:58.637
Did he find her?

152
00:11:58.738 --> 00:12:00.072
I think...

153
00:12:00.806 --> 00:12:02.441
something must have happened.

154
00:12:05.778 --> 00:12:07.046
It was like this...

155
00:12:09.015 --> 00:12:10.683
when Jeong Gu died.

156
00:12:12.184 --> 00:12:14.086
They cleaned his room afterwards.

157
00:12:15.855 --> 00:12:17.023
Killing someone...

158
00:12:18.024 --> 00:12:21.994
is no big deal for these people.

159
00:12:32.004 --> 00:12:37.877
(Muji Daily)

160
00:12:41.414 --> 00:12:44.917
Sang Hwan, I think something must have happened to the reporter.

161
00:12:50.823 --> 00:12:52.224
I'm at Muji Daily.

162
00:12:52.224 --> 00:12:53.592
I'll check right away.

163
00:13:14.413 --> 00:13:17.016
This is what he was wearing in the morning.

164
00:13:25.157 --> 00:13:26.659
What is this?

165
00:13:26.659 --> 00:13:27.860
(Karaoke Bar, Bixie)

166
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.865
It's wet.

167
00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:36.469
He did change his clothes.

168
00:13:38.704 --> 00:13:40.172
If you go over the mountain,

169
00:13:40.172 --> 00:13:42.174
you'll find a river with a bridge.

170
00:13:45.111 --> 00:13:46.245
The river.

171
00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:50.416
You really didn't get any calls from Reporter Hong?

172
00:13:50.483 --> 00:13:51.517
No.

173
00:13:51.517 --> 00:13:53.385
But what is this about?

174
00:13:55.054 --> 00:13:57.423
I know everything.

175
00:13:57.623 --> 00:14:00.860
She escaped from Guseonwon, and she was going to meet me.

176
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.262
But I can neither find her nor call her.

177
00:14:03.262 --> 00:14:04.463
Is this true?

178
00:14:05.464 --> 00:14:08.000
We need to report her to the police as a missing person.

179
00:14:08.267 --> 00:14:09.535
The chief of police and Guseonwon...

180
00:14:09.535 --> 00:14:11.504
have joined hands, so they might not process it.

181
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.140
Then write an article about her going missing after infiltrating...

182
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.941
a religious cult undercover to do a story on them.

183
00:14:16.342 --> 00:14:19.478
The police chief and Guseonwon have joined hands?

184
00:14:19.478 --> 00:14:20.546
He's not the only one.

185
00:14:22.314 --> 00:14:24.450
My dad too. Everyone is connected.

186
00:14:25.251 --> 00:14:26.585
You mean Governor Han?

187
00:14:32.925 --> 00:14:36.295
Will you really be able to disclose all this?

188
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.802
You're basically strangling your father with your own hands.

189
00:14:45.471 --> 00:14:46.505
If I tell you...

190
00:14:47.706 --> 00:14:49.208
that I can't do it,

191
00:14:50.176 --> 00:14:53.579
will you be able to bury the truth fully knowing it?

192
00:15:11.197 --> 00:15:12.231
Hey, Man Hee.

193
00:15:13.666 --> 00:15:14.833
What did you say?

194
00:16:17.663 --> 00:16:18.764
(Karaoke Bar, Bixie)

195
00:16:24.136 --> 00:16:26.505
Where's your mind at these days?

196
00:16:26.505 --> 00:16:28.107
Go back to Seoul if you'll keep this up.

197
00:16:28.107 --> 00:16:29.308
What did you do to Mom?

198
00:16:31.777 --> 00:16:34.280
How dare you glare at me like that?

199
00:16:35.547 --> 00:16:37.449
I moved her to a better hospital.

200
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.252
- I was worried about her, so... - Worried?

201
00:16:45.324 --> 00:16:46.458
Dad.

202
00:16:47.593 --> 00:16:48.827
Do you know what this is?

203
00:16:50.529 --> 00:16:52.231
That's your mom's voice recorder.

204
00:16:53.032 --> 00:16:54.133
That's right.

205
00:16:54.566 --> 00:16:55.868
Why did you bring it?

206
00:16:56.802 --> 00:17:01.307
I must say, you've said so many things to her.

207
00:17:05.611 --> 00:17:08.447
Remember when I pushed you?

208
00:17:08.747 --> 00:17:10.616
Do you know how it made me feel?

209
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.619
The thrill you get when you slaughter an animal.

210
00:17:14.353 --> 00:17:18.190
That's when I realized how much I really...

211
00:17:18.824 --> 00:17:20.092
hate you.

212
00:17:22.861 --> 00:17:23.996
Dad.

213
00:17:24.963 --> 00:17:27.199
You've done horrible things to Mom,

214
00:17:27.933 --> 00:17:29.902
and you're such a cruel person.

215
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.738
I'll tell the whole world about it.

216
00:17:34.073 --> 00:17:35.174
Sang Hwan.

217
00:17:36.475 --> 00:17:38.711
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

218
00:17:38.711 --> 00:17:39.978
Misunderstanding?

219
00:17:41.814 --> 00:17:44.383
How can you lie to me again when there's evidence right here?

220
00:17:45.017 --> 00:17:46.151
Give me that.

221
00:17:48.754 --> 00:17:49.888
No.

222
00:17:51.056 --> 00:17:52.124
Dad.

223
00:17:52.691 --> 00:17:56.762
Don't forget everything you've done...

224
00:17:57.996 --> 00:17:59.965
because you'll have to pay for all of them.

225
00:18:03.268 --> 00:18:04.403
Sang Hwan!

226
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.906
Will you really corner me like this?

227
00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:21.053
Mr. Han.

228
00:18:22.154 --> 00:18:23.555
How can this be happening?

229
00:18:28.494 --> 00:18:30.929
If Sang Hwan finds out that we're keeping his mom,

230
00:18:31.296 --> 00:18:32.498
he won't be...

231
00:18:34.066 --> 00:18:35.567
able to disclose it.

232
00:18:36.702 --> 00:18:37.836
After all this time...

233
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:43.008
That voice recording must not be disclosed.

234
00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:46.512
Ji Hee.

235
00:18:49.581 --> 00:18:50.716
Yes.

236
00:18:51.216 --> 00:18:54.486
You and I are on the same boat, you know.

237
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.190
If they take me down, you'll go down with me.

238
00:18:58.957 --> 00:19:00.426
You got that?

239
00:19:07.466 --> 00:19:08.734
Yes, Mr. Han.

240
00:19:09.334 --> 00:19:11.937
Chief Lee, I need you to unleash your hound.

241
00:19:14.339 --> 00:19:15.707
Whom do you need to hunt down?

242
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:18.043
Han Sang Hwan.

243
00:19:18.911 --> 00:19:20.012
My son.

244
00:19:24.483 --> 00:19:25.484
Pardon?

245
00:19:37.296 --> 00:19:39.665
Hello, are you looking for someone?

246
00:19:39.965 --> 00:19:44.236
Oh, did Mr. Jo leave anything here?

247
00:19:44.403 --> 00:19:46.238
Mr. Jo? Who is that?

248
00:19:46.472 --> 00:19:48.073
Mr. Jo Wan Tae.

249
00:19:48.173 --> 00:19:50.742
- Oh, Wan Tae. - Yes.

250
00:19:50.809 --> 00:19:52.211
He didn't leave anything here.

251
00:19:53.278 --> 00:19:57.149
That's weird. He told me that he left his wallet here earlier...

252
00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:58.484
and asked me to pick it up.

253
00:19:59.117 --> 00:20:00.586
He is a regular here,

254
00:20:01.753 --> 00:20:03.355
but he didn't come today.

255
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.192
I guess he's becoming forgetful because he's been drinking a lot.

256
00:20:07.359 --> 00:20:09.294
- Sorry to bother you. Take care. - Wait!

257
00:20:09.895 --> 00:20:12.898
Gosh, you're pretty cute. You should stay for a drink.

258
00:20:13.765 --> 00:20:15.667
I'll come with Mr. Jo another time.

259
00:20:16.001 --> 00:20:17.603
- I'm sorry. - Will you do that?

260
00:20:17.603 --> 00:20:20.372
(Bixie)

261
00:20:39.191 --> 00:20:40.259
Sang Hwan,

262
00:20:40.692 --> 00:20:42.494
I know that you're looking for your mom.

263
00:20:43.028 --> 00:20:44.496
Give us that voice recorder.

264
00:20:44.863 --> 00:20:46.798
Then you can meet your mom right away.

265
00:20:47.533 --> 00:20:51.470
Listen. If you lay even a finger on my mom,

266
00:20:52.037 --> 00:20:54.373
I'll teach you a lesson. You got that?

267
00:20:57.409 --> 00:20:59.111
Hey there, prince.

268
00:21:02.848 --> 00:21:06.385
Come on. I think we have some business to take care of.

269
00:21:06.585 --> 00:21:07.619
Get out of my way.

270
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.789
If you get on my nerves now, I'll make you regret it.

271
00:21:15.761 --> 00:21:17.362
Hey there, prince.

272
00:21:20.632 --> 00:21:24.136
Come on. I think we have some business to take care of.

273
00:21:24.403 --> 00:21:25.504
Get out of my way.

274
00:21:25.804 --> 00:21:28.574
If you get on my nerves now, I'll make you regret it.

275
00:21:29.474 --> 00:21:33.245
Just give me that voice recorder, and you won't have to see me again.

276
00:21:34.246 --> 00:21:35.480
I told you to get out of my way.

277
00:22:05.544 --> 00:22:06.712
You little...

278
00:22:13.285 --> 00:22:17.356
I have to take this to make some money off of it, okay?

279
00:22:24.096 --> 00:22:25.364
Sang Hwan!

280
00:22:26.565 --> 00:22:27.733
Sang Hwan, are you okay?

281
00:22:43.081 --> 00:22:45.584
By any chance, did you hear to which hospital my mom was...

282
00:22:46.184 --> 00:22:48.153
being transferred when she was checking out?

283
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.124
Mr. Han's secretary said that the order came from him,

284
00:22:52.124 --> 00:22:53.692
so we just did it for her.

285
00:22:53.725 --> 00:22:55.193
We don't know anything else.

286
00:23:06.905 --> 00:23:08.073
Sang Hwan.

287
00:23:09.274 --> 00:23:12.144
I'm trying to get elected as governor again...

288
00:23:12.344 --> 00:23:13.612
for your mom.

289
00:23:14.046 --> 00:23:15.580
If I become the governor,

290
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.850
your mother will wake up again.

291
00:23:19.785 --> 00:23:20.986
Three years ago,

292
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.323
I made a wrong choice because of my mom.

293
00:23:26.224 --> 00:23:27.325
And I couldn't help...

294
00:23:28.293 --> 00:23:29.494
Sang Mi...

295
00:23:30.162 --> 00:23:31.363
or Dong Cheol.

296
00:23:32.431 --> 00:23:33.732
I don't want...

297
00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:36.034
to regret the same thing again.

298
00:23:37.335 --> 00:23:38.403
First,

299
00:23:39.104 --> 00:23:42.374
we need to go to the police and Guseonwon.

300
00:23:46.111 --> 00:23:47.245
Yes.

301
00:24:14.573 --> 00:24:15.674
Hello.

302
00:24:29.454 --> 00:24:32.624
If you're listening to this, you must have...

303
00:24:33.125 --> 00:24:35.794
done something you shouldn't have.

304
00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:39.631
Father, I have trusted you until the end.

305
00:24:39.765 --> 00:24:41.366
But now I know...

306
00:24:41.633 --> 00:24:44.636
that a wrong trust can be dangerous.

307
00:24:44.636 --> 00:24:47.372
Now I know exactly how...

308
00:24:47.973 --> 00:24:50.942
it can hurt so many people.

309
00:24:54.346 --> 00:24:56.481
You shouldn't do this.

310
00:24:56.481 --> 00:24:57.883
It's too late. You should come back tomorrow.

311
00:24:57.883 --> 00:24:59.251
I need to see someone.

312
00:24:59.251 --> 00:25:00.585
Gosh, how dare you!

313
00:25:00.585 --> 00:25:02.053
I said you can't come here.

314
00:25:02.053 --> 00:25:03.054
Let me go.

315
00:25:07.993 --> 00:25:10.362
You two should go now.

316
00:25:10.362 --> 00:25:11.630
But, Spiritual Father...

317
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.764
It's all right.

318
00:25:13.732 --> 00:25:16.935
I have Apostle Im by my side.

319
00:25:16.935 --> 00:25:18.270
- Yes. - Yes.

320
00:25:22.774 --> 00:25:23.875
Come in.

321
00:25:25.744 --> 00:25:29.181
Sergeant Woo is like a father to me.

322
00:25:30.782 --> 00:25:34.553
When I was young, my father died in a car accident,

323
00:25:34.553 --> 00:25:36.354
and I lived with my sick mother.

324
00:25:37.122 --> 00:25:39.791
And he even paid for my university tuition fees.

325
00:25:40.292 --> 00:25:42.494
Is that so?

326
00:25:42.794 --> 00:25:45.130
You must be grateful.

327
00:25:45.263 --> 00:25:46.932
Don't you think so too?

328
00:25:47.265 --> 00:25:52.003
Yes, Sergeant Woo has a pure heart.

329
00:25:52.003 --> 00:25:55.140
That must be why he was chosen by the Almighty.

330
00:25:56.942 --> 00:26:00.011
You are all crazy.

331
00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.952
Pastor Baek, you must know very well what I am talking about.

332
00:26:07.352 --> 00:26:09.855
If you take advantage of him again like this,

333
00:26:09.855 --> 00:26:11.923
I won't let it slide.

334
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.291
Do you understand?

335
00:26:13.992 --> 00:26:15.393
Officer Choi,

336
00:26:15.393 --> 00:26:17.762
there must be a misunderstanding.

337
00:26:17.762 --> 00:26:18.930
A misunderstanding?

338
00:26:20.432 --> 00:26:21.733
Apostle Im,

339
00:26:21.833 --> 00:26:24.536
please give us some space.

340
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:26.905
Of course.

341
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.560
I know that there are dozens of...

342
00:26:48.994 --> 00:26:52.530
homeless people that Sergeant Woo is taking care of.

343
00:26:55.233 --> 00:26:57.135
Do you think it would be okay...

344
00:26:57.903 --> 00:27:02.374
if a father-figure like him gets hurt because of you?

345
00:27:03.975 --> 00:27:05.010
What?

346
00:27:05.043 --> 00:27:06.711
Do you think that's all?

347
00:27:07.012 --> 00:27:12.183
His son and wife would be so shocked.

348
00:27:12.584 --> 00:27:15.854
Do you think that Sergeant Woo...

349
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:18.890
and his family would be...

350
00:27:21.192 --> 00:27:23.595
able to withstand the criticism of the world?

351
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:26.631
What if...

352
00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:30.502
he makes the wrong choice?

353
00:27:33.471 --> 00:27:36.675
Do you think you will be able to...

354
00:27:37.142 --> 00:27:39.044
cope with all of this?

355
00:27:57.162 --> 00:27:59.764
If you really think of him as your father,

356
00:28:00.065 --> 00:28:01.633
you should go home quietly.

357
00:28:01.933 --> 00:28:05.403
That's the only way you can repay him...

358
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.372
for what he has done for you.

359
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:44.542
It's all right.

360
00:28:45.143 --> 00:28:48.146
Lift your head, and look at me.

361
00:28:53.451 --> 00:28:54.552
Now.

362
00:29:05.663 --> 00:29:07.432
You will be...

363
00:29:08.233 --> 00:29:11.803
of great use to the Almighty.

364
00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:14.973
If you listen to me carefully...

365
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.976
and finish this job well,

366
00:29:18.443 --> 00:29:19.944
you can get out...

367
00:29:21.046 --> 00:29:23.314
and go to paradise.

368
00:29:23.715 --> 00:29:25.183
Do you understand?

369
00:29:27.252 --> 00:29:28.353
I can...

370
00:29:29.054 --> 00:29:30.355
get out?

371
00:29:33.091 --> 00:29:36.594
If you go outside, you will see the devil...

372
00:29:37.162 --> 00:29:40.331
in the form of a female police officer.

373
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.234
The devil.

374
00:29:44.302 --> 00:29:45.503
Female police officer.

375
00:29:46.104 --> 00:29:48.673
Devil. Female police officer.

376
00:29:48.673 --> 00:29:50.075
Don't be afraid.

377
00:29:51.709 --> 00:29:55.780
You just need to trust me.

378
00:30:00.385 --> 00:30:03.655
Yes, Governor Han. How have you been?

379
00:30:03.655 --> 00:30:05.523
Hello,

380
00:30:05.924 --> 00:30:07.625
you're the Spiritual Father, right?

381
00:30:07.792 --> 00:30:09.594
Why did you call me at such a late hour?

382
00:30:09.594 --> 00:30:11.362
I came to pray at night,

383
00:30:11.663 --> 00:30:14.432
and you came into my mind.

384
00:30:16.034 --> 00:30:17.602
Really?

385
00:30:19.304 --> 00:30:22.440
You must be so upset...

386
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.444
because of the protests from the villagers.

387
00:30:26.644 --> 00:30:28.880
The Almighty has told me...

388
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.484
to help you get rid of such worries...

389
00:30:32.884 --> 00:30:35.553
during my prayer.

390
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.422
Really?

391
00:30:37.422 --> 00:30:41.092
I heard that many of the villagers who were protesting...

392
00:30:41.192 --> 00:30:44.162
were believers of Guseonwon.

393
00:30:46.264 --> 00:30:49.801
It is my mission to lead such believers well...

394
00:30:50.001 --> 00:30:51.903
in times like this.

395
00:30:53.304 --> 00:30:56.875
Then how do you want me to show my appreciation?

396
00:30:57.475 --> 00:31:00.345
You crazy scum. Gosh.

397
00:31:04.883 --> 00:31:08.720
I need a loyal guard that will be able...

398
00:31:09.354 --> 00:31:11.890
to protect the Almighty.

399
00:31:39.484 --> 00:31:40.585
What is this?

400
00:31:42.253 --> 00:31:44.722
There's a place called Guseonwon far away from here.

401
00:31:44.989 --> 00:31:46.891
You should go and stay there until it gets quiet.

402
00:31:49.561 --> 00:31:51.162
Did you say Guseonwon?

403
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.465
What? You know about it too?

404
00:31:54.566 --> 00:31:56.100
There's a place called...

405
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.136
Guseonwon 20 minutes away from town.

406
00:31:58.136 --> 00:32:01.072
It's a great church. You should come visit.

407
00:32:01.072 --> 00:32:03.975
I'll make you a better person.

408
00:32:04.943 --> 00:32:08.379
Do you want me to repent or something?

409
00:32:08.379 --> 00:32:10.014
Don't do anything stupid and...

410
00:32:10.014 --> 00:32:12.884
watch someone called Baek Jung Ki until the governor gives orders.

411
00:32:14.152 --> 00:32:16.254
Gosh, is the governor...

412
00:32:16.955 --> 00:32:19.524
trying to become the master of everything?

413
00:32:20.625 --> 00:32:22.994
Gosh, he is greedy.

414
00:32:24.762 --> 00:32:26.864
Have you seen anyone who's not?

415
00:32:41.012 --> 00:32:43.081
- Oh, my. - Here.

416
00:33:06.371 --> 00:33:08.006
Someone went missing.

417
00:33:08.006 --> 00:33:09.340
Help me find her.

418
00:33:09.874 --> 00:33:10.875
Who?

419
00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:12.610
A woman called Hong So Rin.

420
00:33:13.111 --> 00:33:14.846
- She's a reporter. - A reporter?

421
00:33:16.114 --> 00:33:17.915
Are you talking about that reporter...

422
00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:19.284
who just got reported missing by Muji Daily?

423
00:33:19.884 --> 00:33:20.852
Yes.

424
00:33:20.852 --> 00:33:22.920
Does she have something to do with Guseonwon as well?

425
00:33:23.054 --> 00:33:25.490
Her identity got revealed while she was working undercover.

426
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.225
She was locked up, but she managed to run away.

427
00:33:27.225 --> 00:33:28.793
She went missing at Muji River...

428
00:33:29.294 --> 00:33:30.495
that's near Guseonwon.

429
00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.705
I'm going to start investigating Guseonwon tomorrow morning.

430
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.474
Really?

431
00:33:43.474 --> 00:33:46.644
So come with your friend tomorrow, and tell me where...

432
00:33:46.844 --> 00:33:49.013
- your friend was locked up. - Okay.

433
00:33:50.581 --> 00:33:51.683
Just a second.

434
00:33:52.884 --> 00:33:55.620
Dong Cheol, we need to meet right now.

435
00:33:59.123 --> 00:34:00.825
Dong Cheol. Dong Cheol.

436
00:34:04.095 --> 00:34:07.265
The police and I are going to that place where Jung Hoon was locked up.

437
00:34:07.732 --> 00:34:11.302
Jung Hoon told me that there were other people locked up there.

438
00:34:11.502 --> 00:34:13.404
He even saw some people die there too.

439
00:34:13.705 --> 00:34:17.275
But they might expect Jung Hoon to tell everything to the police.

440
00:34:17.275 --> 00:34:19.243
Do you think they still keep them there?

441
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.512
You're right. I'm kind of worried about that.

442
00:34:21.512 --> 00:34:24.015
If you fail to catch them tomorrow,

443
00:34:24.382 --> 00:34:26.184
I'll just reveal my identity and get locked up myself.

444
00:34:26.284 --> 00:34:28.152
Then I'll try to look for other people who got locked up.

445
00:34:28.753 --> 00:34:31.122
- That's too dangerous. - We have no other choice now.

446
00:34:31.155 --> 00:34:32.490
We have to do this.

447
00:34:33.591 --> 00:34:36.294
I don't even know what's going on inside Sang Mi's head anymore.

448
00:34:44.035 --> 00:34:45.103
Jung Hoon.

449
00:34:45.603 --> 00:34:46.804
What brings you here?

450
00:34:47.205 --> 00:34:50.241
Did my dad go somewhere?

451
00:34:51.442 --> 00:34:53.745
He's out on patrol. Is he not answering his phone?

452
00:34:54.979 --> 00:34:57.315
No, I just came in while I was passing by.

453
00:34:57.315 --> 00:35:00.485
I'm glad you're here. Stay here until I come back from the bathroom.

454
00:35:01.352 --> 00:35:02.453
Okay.

455
00:35:19.704 --> 00:35:20.805
My sister's birthday.

456
00:35:26.244 --> 00:35:27.445
My birthday?

457
00:36:04.315 --> 00:36:06.684
My goodness.

458
00:36:07.452 --> 00:36:09.153
What are you doing here?

459
00:36:09.353 --> 00:36:12.190
I just came by.

460
00:36:16.594 --> 00:36:19.230
Why didn't you answer my calls? Where are you?

461
00:36:27.772 --> 00:36:31.342
Jung Hoon, you should go home first.

462
00:37:06.043 --> 00:37:08.980
If you want to know where that reporter went,

463
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.082
come look for me quietly.

464
00:37:25.963 --> 00:37:27.265
Are you okay now?

465
00:37:27.865 --> 00:37:29.834
You're in this with them, aren't you?

466
00:37:30.034 --> 00:37:32.803
No, I'm not in this with anyone. They're just my friends.

467
00:37:32.803 --> 00:37:34.171
What do you want?

468
00:37:34.472 --> 00:37:36.374
Why do you keep trying to get in our way?

469
00:37:36.474 --> 00:37:40.344
Do you really believe that Spiritual Father leads you to paradise?

470
00:37:40.745 --> 00:37:43.514
Or do you just wish to believe so?

471
00:37:47.385 --> 00:37:48.853
The believers here told me that...

472
00:37:50.855 --> 00:37:51.923
you also once sacrificed...

473
00:37:52.623 --> 00:37:54.492
your daughter into becoming the Spiritual Mother.

474
00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.094
Did your daughter also tell you...

475
00:37:58.329 --> 00:37:59.630
that Spiritual Father was real?

476
00:38:03.134 --> 00:38:04.802
- What do you know? - If you...

477
00:38:05.403 --> 00:38:07.572
really believe that Spiritual Father leads you to paradise,

478
00:38:08.072 --> 00:38:10.174
you can go ahead, and tell him about my identity.

479
00:38:11.709 --> 00:38:14.245
But if you wish to see...

480
00:38:15.112 --> 00:38:17.315
if he's real or fake,

481
00:38:18.082 --> 00:38:19.183
you should sit back and watch.

482
00:38:20.084 --> 00:38:21.452
Because we're going to reveal...

483
00:38:23.254 --> 00:38:24.522
that he's fake.

484
00:38:35.433 --> 00:38:38.102
I'm sure the Almighty will...

485
00:38:38.803 --> 00:38:40.771
cleanse this place.

486
00:38:43.274 --> 00:38:44.575
Right?

487
00:38:45.543 --> 00:38:47.912
You're going to burn all the bad sins...

488
00:38:48.679 --> 00:38:50.314
of this place...

489
00:38:50.982 --> 00:38:52.350
with your hot fire,

490
00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:55.419
and make it into a brand new place, right?

491
00:38:57.955 --> 00:38:59.023
Am I right?

492
00:39:13.504 --> 00:39:14.672
Young Hee.

493
00:39:15.873 --> 00:39:17.174
Young Hee, listen to me.

494
00:39:18.542 --> 00:39:20.411
I think you're mistaken.

495
00:39:26.884 --> 00:39:28.653
- Young Hee. - Why did you do this?

496
00:39:28.919 --> 00:39:31.989
You said I should be careful of what I eat.

497
00:39:32.523 --> 00:39:35.292
No, that's not it.

498
00:39:35.292 --> 00:39:36.494
Mr. Woo.

499
00:39:40.231 --> 00:39:42.900
- You should just confess. - Young Hee, let me explain.

500
00:39:43.234 --> 00:39:45.069
I didn't do it on purpose.

501
00:39:45.302 --> 00:39:48.339
I just kind of got myself involved unknowingly.

502
00:39:48.773 --> 00:39:49.940
Young Hee, watch out!

503
00:39:54.545 --> 00:39:55.813
Mr. Woo!

504
00:39:56.814 --> 00:39:58.282
You devil!

505
00:40:03.821 --> 00:40:05.389
You must die...

506
00:40:05.423 --> 00:40:07.792
- in order for us to go to paradise. - Mr. Woo.

507
00:40:07.792 --> 00:40:09.760
Are you okay? Please wait a little bit.

508
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.463
I might as well just break everything into pieces.

509
00:40:17.802 --> 00:40:19.103
Dad.

510
00:40:19.303 --> 00:40:21.372
Dad. Dad.

511
00:40:21.739 --> 00:40:23.974
What... What happened?

512
00:40:24.675 --> 00:40:27.344
Don't worry. Fortunately, he didn't get severely injured.

513
00:40:27.611 --> 00:40:28.913
They said he's good to go.

514
00:40:30.214 --> 00:40:31.482
Are you okay, Dad?

515
00:40:34.652 --> 00:40:36.954
Can you excuse us for a while?

516
00:40:44.595 --> 00:40:45.930
Sit down.

517
00:40:53.604 --> 00:40:54.605
Jung Hoon.

518
00:40:56.474 --> 00:40:57.842
You're not going to...

519
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:01.412
hate me, right?

520
00:41:04.949 --> 00:41:07.685
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

521
00:41:09.353 --> 00:41:10.454
Jung Hoon.

522
00:41:11.689 --> 00:41:12.923
I want you to...

523
00:41:14.492 --> 00:41:17.294
listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

524
00:41:20.564 --> 00:41:21.699
Well...

525
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.464
He's the one who entered our property without permission.

526
00:41:53.464 --> 00:41:55.099
Doesn't that make us the victims?

527
00:41:55.099 --> 00:41:58.369
Yes, you can report him. He'll have to pay a fine.

528
00:41:59.904 --> 00:42:03.040
Chief, there's nothing here.

529
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.109
- What? - I think...

530
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:07.645
he came in here out of curiosity and just lied because...

531
00:42:07.645 --> 00:42:09.079
he thought he wouldn't be able to get out of it.

532
00:42:09.079 --> 00:42:12.550
What? I saw it with my own two eyes.

533
00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.254
Hey!

534
00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:48.085
It was built during the Korean War. We're using it as a warehouse.

535
00:42:48.919 --> 00:42:51.055
How many times must I tell you that there's nothing here?

536
00:42:52.022 --> 00:42:54.391
Why can't you trust me?

537
00:43:11.275 --> 00:43:13.344
Did you find what you were looking for?

538
00:43:15.079 --> 00:43:16.513
I guess there was a misunderstanding.

539
00:43:17.014 --> 00:43:19.183
I'm sorry to have caused a fuss from so early in the morning.

540
00:43:19.683 --> 00:43:22.319
How strange.

541
00:43:23.554 --> 00:43:27.491
We have nothing against you.

542
00:43:28.025 --> 00:43:32.263
But you seem to disagree with our religion,

543
00:43:32.529 --> 00:43:33.831
and you keep trying to defame us.

544
00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:38.269
From what I know, you even...

545
00:43:38.769 --> 00:43:41.872
secretly came in here once before.

546
00:43:41.872 --> 00:43:44.074
I came in because this place smelled nasty.

547
00:43:44.074 --> 00:43:45.209
Hey.

548
00:43:45.342 --> 00:43:47.011
If you keep doing this,

549
00:43:47.011 --> 00:43:49.113
we're no longer just going to sit back and watch.

550
00:43:49.113 --> 00:43:51.782
Why? Are you going to kidnap me and lock me up?

551
00:43:51.782 --> 00:43:54.151
- What did you say? - I'll forgive you.

552
00:43:55.819 --> 00:43:58.822
So please leave.

553
00:44:00.524 --> 00:44:02.293
This is how generous he is.

554
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.062
He forgives everyone for everything.

555
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:06.463
"Forgive"?

556
00:44:07.164 --> 00:44:09.199
I never asked you for your forgiveness.

557
00:44:10.134 --> 00:44:12.303
Chief, these guys are all lying right now.

558
00:44:12.303 --> 00:44:14.104
They're all in this together!

559
00:44:14.605 --> 00:44:17.341
Stop it. That's enough.

560
00:44:17.374 --> 00:44:18.842
My gosh.

561
00:44:18.842 --> 00:44:19.944
Hey.

562
00:44:21.045 --> 00:44:22.780
You shouldn't do this.

563
00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.781
Please leave.

564
00:44:45.302 --> 00:44:47.705
(Spiritual Father's Room)

565
00:44:49.673 --> 00:44:51.642
Yes, come in.

566
00:45:07.791 --> 00:45:10.694
Don't just stand there. Please sit down.

567
00:45:16.433 --> 00:45:19.570
From now on, you and Dong Cheol...

568
00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:23.040
will stay by my side and guard me.

569
00:45:24.341 --> 00:45:26.744
- Pardon? - It is your duty...

570
00:45:26.744 --> 00:45:29.580
to act as gatekeeper of paradise.

571
00:45:31.982 --> 00:45:33.083
Okay.

572
00:45:35.953 --> 00:45:37.321
What are you doing right now?

573
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:42.493
Do you have a problem with...

574
00:45:42.493 --> 00:45:45.329
what our Almighty wishes to do?

575
00:45:58.042 --> 00:45:59.343
What are you doing?

576
00:46:01.979 --> 00:46:03.213
I'm gatekeeping.

577
00:46:07.885 --> 00:46:10.554
My gosh, this is ridiculous.

578
00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:16.493
I'll see you again, Mr. Gatekeeper.

579
00:46:18.095 --> 00:46:20.564
Mr. Gatekeeper, Mr. Gatekeeper

580
00:46:20.564 --> 00:46:22.633
I can't believe this.

581
00:46:27.504 --> 00:46:28.672
See?

582
00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:33.343
He may have met our Almighty long before you,

583
00:46:33.544 --> 00:46:35.512
but if you fail to pray diligently,

584
00:46:35.512 --> 00:46:38.949
your heart will be filled with distrust...

585
00:46:38.949 --> 00:46:41.652
and arrogance like him.

586
00:46:42.119 --> 00:46:46.023
Both of you will be able to get on the first class seats...

587
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.893
of the Boat of Salvation on the Day of Salvation.

588
00:46:53.163 --> 00:46:54.264
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

589
00:47:05.342 --> 00:47:07.044
What's going on?

590
00:47:08.879 --> 00:47:13.150
I don't know what the governor's hiding here,

591
00:47:14.184 --> 00:47:17.754
but he asked me to stay here, and keep an eye on him.

592
00:47:17.754 --> 00:47:19.123
Sang Hwan's dad asked you to come here?

593
00:47:19.389 --> 00:47:22.292
But I heard he asked the governor to...

594
00:47:22.292 --> 00:47:24.394
send him someone to guard him.

595
00:47:25.963 --> 00:47:29.099
That means he doesn't trust anyone here.

596
00:47:30.234 --> 00:47:33.504
I can already sense that Jo Wan Tae has done...

597
00:47:33.504 --> 00:47:35.072
some dirty deeds.

598
00:47:35.539 --> 00:47:38.308
They're all just similar people fighting for similar things.

599
00:47:39.042 --> 00:47:40.844
- Jo Wan Tae? - Yes.

600
00:47:40.844 --> 00:47:42.613
How do you know him?

601
00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.150
I saw him once at a karaoke bar.

602
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.252
"Karaoke bar"?

603
00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.021
Joon Gu.

604
00:47:52.723 --> 00:47:54.625
I'm pretty sure you already know,

605
00:47:54.992 --> 00:47:57.094
but this isn't an ordinary church.

606
00:47:57.561 --> 00:47:58.662
You should be careful.

607
00:48:11.275 --> 00:48:14.011
(Karaoke Bar, Bixie)

608
00:48:14.912 --> 00:48:16.413
I wonder when he's going to go here again.

609
00:48:23.453 --> 00:48:24.621
Apostle Jo.

610
00:48:26.323 --> 00:48:27.424
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

611
00:48:27.724 --> 00:48:28.859
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

612
00:48:30.994 --> 00:48:34.665
Shouldn't you be by Spiritual Father's side?

613
00:48:34.665 --> 00:48:36.200
I just got really worried.

614
00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.170
I heard that the police might do an open search on Guseonwon...

615
00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.673
because Hong So Rin suddenly disappeared.

616
00:48:42.773 --> 00:48:46.343
This place is special, so they won't be able to enter without permission.

617
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:48.478
So don't worry.

618
00:48:48.712 --> 00:48:52.883
By the way, I'm not going to be back tonight.

619
00:48:52.883 --> 00:48:56.019
So call me if you need me for anything.

620
00:48:56.053 --> 00:48:57.120
Okay?

621
00:48:57.921 --> 00:48:59.223
It must be today.

622
00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:01.858
Oh, okay.

623
00:49:03.794 --> 00:49:05.062
Drive safely.

624
00:49:05.262 --> 00:49:06.330
Okay.

625
00:49:14.705 --> 00:49:16.473
I think he's going to Bixie right now.

626
00:49:16.473 --> 00:49:19.509
(I think he's going to Bixie right now.)

627
00:49:22.212 --> 00:49:24.381
He's really here.

628
00:49:24.381 --> 00:49:26.550
I'm glad we listened to Dong Cheol and waited here for him.

629
00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:28.619
My gosh, do you think we'll be okay?

630
00:49:28.619 --> 00:49:31.822
When did we ever think about that before we did anything?

631
00:49:33.123 --> 00:49:34.124
Let's begin.

632
00:49:42.699 --> 00:49:44.334
Hello? Dong Cheol?

633
00:49:45.068 --> 00:49:46.503
What do you think?

634
00:49:46.503 --> 00:49:49.373
I'm here to spread the honor and glory of our Almighty.

635
00:49:49.539 --> 00:49:52.142
Why did you call? The Spiritual Father?

636
00:49:53.443 --> 00:49:56.113
Why does he want to see me?

637
00:49:57.414 --> 00:49:58.982
I'll call you later.

638
00:50:03.153 --> 00:50:04.254
Are you Jo Wan Tae?

639
00:50:05.889 --> 00:50:08.225
Why does he want to see me?

640
00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.461
I'll call you later.

641
00:50:14.898 --> 00:50:16.099
Are you Jo Wan Tae?

642
00:50:17.567 --> 00:50:21.605
The police are going to investigate Guseonwon soon.

643
00:50:21.638 --> 00:50:25.742
That means you won't be able to walk around like this for long.

644
00:50:29.012 --> 00:50:33.383
You must be acing up because you're the governor's son.

645
00:50:33.383 --> 00:50:35.419
Do you think things will go your way?

646
00:50:35.752 --> 00:50:39.990
Guseonwon was built on a special land that was chosen by Almighty.

647
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:42.259
How many times must I tell you that it's not a place...

648
00:50:42.259 --> 00:50:43.994
where you can enter without permission?

649
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:45.595
I think things will go my way.

650
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.131
The police told me so.

651
00:50:48.665 --> 00:50:50.934
You should talk more politely for someone who's younger than me.

652
00:50:50.934 --> 00:50:54.304
Do you think the police will even be able to find anything?

653
00:50:54.304 --> 00:50:56.773
You already checked with the police that there's nothing strange there.

654
00:50:56.773 --> 00:50:58.008
If we...

655
00:50:58.942 --> 00:51:00.610
find the person you murdered,

656
00:51:01.745 --> 00:51:03.180
the story will unfold differently.

657
00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.749
- What? - I already know that...

658
00:51:06.516 --> 00:51:09.086
you were at Muji River last night.

659
00:51:09.753 --> 00:51:12.756
I also know that you met Reporter Hong So Rin there.

660
00:51:13.256 --> 00:51:16.760
You took her into Muji River and killed her,

661
00:51:17.294 --> 00:51:18.362
didn't you?

662
00:51:20.297 --> 00:51:22.499
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

663
00:51:23.433 --> 00:51:24.901
I know you weren't...

664
00:51:25.669 --> 00:51:27.237
in Guseonwon at that hour.

665
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.206
The clothes you were wearing...

666
00:51:29.206 --> 00:51:31.341
were also wet in muddy water.

667
00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:35.178
I heard they found Reporter Hong's shoe at Muji River.

668
00:51:35.712 --> 00:51:36.813
Thankfully,

669
00:51:37.647 --> 00:51:40.784
we have a witness, so we've already recorded that person's testimony.

670
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:43.987
As soon as the police investigates and finds her body,

671
00:51:45.288 --> 00:51:46.590
I'll be able to send you to prison.

672
00:51:48.725 --> 00:51:50.694
Really? Then I guess...

673
00:51:51.294 --> 00:51:53.597
I should check that recording.

674
00:51:57.934 --> 00:52:00.437
You foolish scum.

675
00:52:00.437 --> 00:52:02.305
I even killed Hong So Rin.

676
00:52:02.305 --> 00:52:04.841
Killing you will be a piece of cake.

677
00:52:04.841 --> 00:52:08.111
Let's hear that witness' testimony. Let me hear it.

678
00:52:10.981 --> 00:52:12.015
Come here.

679
00:52:12.382 --> 00:52:13.717
These rats...

680
00:52:13.817 --> 00:52:15.252
You little...

681
00:52:17.654 --> 00:52:20.557
You pieces of... How dare you!

682
00:52:24.494 --> 00:52:26.363
Hey, you guys. Break it up.

683
00:52:27.297 --> 00:52:28.598
Stop.

684
00:52:28.698 --> 00:52:29.933
You punks.

685
00:52:35.705 --> 00:52:38.008
What do you mean I killed someone? Me?

686
00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:41.511
Whom did I kill? You saw everything.

687
00:52:41.511 --> 00:52:43.713
All three of these punks came at me.

688
00:52:44.014 --> 00:52:47.651
They randomly accused me of killing someone and started beating me up.

689
00:52:47.884 --> 00:52:50.854
Chief, you know...

690
00:52:50.854 --> 00:52:54.758
that I believe Almighty. How can I kill anyone?

691
00:52:56.092 --> 00:52:59.262
I even killed Hong So Rin. Killing you will be a piece of cake.

692
00:52:59.262 --> 00:53:01.164
You punk. I'll teach you a lesson.

693
00:53:01.998 --> 00:53:04.701
I lied to him and said that I have a recording of a witness statement,

694
00:53:04.901 --> 00:53:07.437
but he tried to kill me as soon as he heard it.

695
00:53:07.504 --> 00:53:11.174
And whether we assaulted him or acted in self-defense...

696
00:53:11.408 --> 00:53:14.945
will become clear if you watch the CCTV footage from that camera.

697
00:53:15.645 --> 00:53:16.980
- Arrest him. - Yes, sir.

698
00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:18.648
Chief, I can explain...

699
00:53:18.648 --> 00:53:20.250
Gosh, what are you doing?

700
00:53:20.283 --> 00:53:22.252
I'll recite your Miranda rights.

701
00:53:22.252 --> 00:53:24.287
- You have the right to remain... - You scum.

702
00:53:24.287 --> 00:53:25.655
You have the right to remain silent.

703
00:53:25.655 --> 00:53:27.958
How dare you tell me to keep still? You punk. If I catch you, I'll...

704
00:53:27.958 --> 00:53:30.093
- Hey, Han Sang Hwan! - Guys, bring him to the car.

705
00:53:30.093 --> 00:53:32.863
- Yes, sir. - Why are you doing this to me?

706
00:53:32.863 --> 00:53:34.331
I really didn't do anything!

707
00:53:34.498 --> 00:53:37.634
I'll be sure to teach you punks a lesson. How dare you!

708
00:53:37.767 --> 00:53:40.070
- Shut it, and get in the car. - I really didn't do it!

709
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:41.938
I did nothing wrong! Darn it!

710
00:54:14.037 --> 00:54:17.607
We have a recording of your confession to killing Hong So Rin.

711
00:54:17.874 --> 00:54:20.010
You were also behind Officer Choi getting stabbed.

712
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:22.712
I heard you paid the homeless guy to do it.

713
00:54:22.712 --> 00:54:23.780
Why did you do that?

714
00:54:25.582 --> 00:54:27.617
What? Stab whom?

715
00:54:27.617 --> 00:54:29.719
He confessed to us that you asked him to do it.

716
00:54:31.488 --> 00:54:32.989
I asked him to do it?

717
00:54:36.393 --> 00:54:37.761
Baek Jung Ki, that piece of...

718
00:54:39.696 --> 00:54:40.864
Mr. Jo.

719
00:54:42.132 --> 00:54:45.001
Let's not waste our energy like this.

720
00:54:47.604 --> 00:54:48.872
Let me use the washroom.

721
00:54:48.872 --> 00:54:52.576
It looks like this will take a long time. Aren't I right?

722
00:55:05.221 --> 00:55:07.490
Jo Wan Tae just got arrested.

723
00:55:07.691 --> 00:55:08.992
Seriously?

724
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.761
Then is he the one...

725
00:55:13.263 --> 00:55:14.431
who killed Reporter Hong?

726
00:55:15.765 --> 00:55:18.902
Listen to me carefully.

727
00:55:19.636 --> 00:55:22.872
Go to the cult leader, and tell him who I really am.

728
00:55:23.907 --> 00:55:26.176
- What? - This is the only way we can...

729
00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:27.944
shake that place upside down.

730
00:55:28.745 --> 00:55:30.513
What on earth are you thinking?

731
00:55:30.513 --> 00:55:32.449
If he finds out that I'm Sang Hwan's friend,

732
00:55:32.949 --> 00:55:36.486
he'll lock me up in the basement storage with other people.

733
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.923
Those people who disappeared today are the most crucial evidence.

734
00:55:40.957 --> 00:55:44.361
You need to blow my cover in order for us to bring the truth to light.

735
00:55:46.129 --> 00:55:48.064
You have to do it to gain his full trust.

736
00:55:49.666 --> 00:55:50.700
I can't do that.

737
00:55:51.101 --> 00:55:52.535
It'll be too dangerous for you.

738
00:55:52.969 --> 00:55:54.137
I'll go down there.

739
00:55:54.771 --> 00:55:58.008
Don't. I'll do my very best,

740
00:55:58.675 --> 00:55:59.976
so you should do your best too.

741
00:56:04.414 --> 00:56:05.448
Dong Cheol.

742
00:56:08.084 --> 00:56:11.354
I'll do what you asked me to do, but you have to do me a favor too.

743
00:56:14.758 --> 00:56:15.825
I'll have...

744
00:56:17.127 --> 00:56:18.361
a spiritual wedding with him.

745
00:56:19.696 --> 00:56:20.697
What?

746
00:56:20.697 --> 00:56:23.600
I'll record everything that disgusting jerk does to have me.

747
00:56:24.367 --> 00:56:26.169
It's the most solid evidence we can get.

748
00:56:26.503 --> 00:56:28.438
- Sang Mi. - Baek Jung Ki, that scum.

749
00:56:28.805 --> 00:56:32.475
He let me go once, but he absolutely won't give up this time.

750
00:56:32.609 --> 00:56:34.044
I know that he'll try to have me...

751
00:56:34.844 --> 00:56:36.079
at all costs.

752
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.782
- Have you lost your mind? - No.

753
00:56:41.418 --> 00:56:42.519
I'm totally sane.

754
00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:44.688
I finally have a clear idea...

755
00:56:45.689 --> 00:56:47.157
of what I can do to take him down.

756
00:56:48.958 --> 00:56:50.660
You guys should come to where I am.

757
00:56:51.528 --> 00:56:52.962
Just before he gets...

758
00:56:55.365 --> 00:56:58.368
what he wants, barge in and save me.

759
00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:02.038
Do you really have to do this?

760
00:57:02.038 --> 00:57:03.673
I came back here because...

761
00:57:05.775 --> 00:57:06.876
I no longer...

762
00:57:08.611 --> 00:57:10.246
want to fear them...

763
00:57:11.081 --> 00:57:12.716
or run away from them.

764
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:17.520
I plan to destroy this place with my own hands...

765
00:57:19.022 --> 00:57:21.224
so that I can save Sang Jin, Mom,

766
00:57:21.925 --> 00:57:23.993
and Dad who's lost his mind because of those scoundrels.

767
00:57:27.764 --> 00:57:28.898
I will...

768
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.402
save them at all costs.

769
00:57:49.552 --> 00:57:51.821
- Detective. - What?

770
00:57:52.422 --> 00:57:54.390
I can't unzip my pants because of these cuffs.

771
00:57:54.724 --> 00:57:56.993
Please help me out here.

772
00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:21.818
Hey, get him!

773
00:58:22.252 --> 00:58:23.353
That rat!

774
00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:25.188
Don't let him get away!

775
00:58:25.188 --> 00:58:26.322
Get him!

776
00:58:27.891 --> 00:58:28.892
Hurry!

777
00:58:29.392 --> 00:58:30.727
Hey, stop right there!

778
00:58:34.898 --> 00:58:36.199
- Get him! - Gosh!

779
00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.568
Hey!

780
00:58:38.568 --> 00:58:40.336
That crazy jerk.

781
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:41.704
Stop right there!

782
00:58:47.076 --> 00:58:48.444
It's here.

783
00:58:53.817 --> 00:58:57.153
Why are you so dressed up? I told you to wear something comfortable.

784
00:58:57.153 --> 00:58:59.422
I had no idea there was a place like this here.

785
00:58:59.422 --> 00:59:01.624
This is the paradise, the true paradise.

786
00:59:01.858 --> 00:59:03.059
Yes, totally.

787
00:59:03.059 --> 00:59:05.829
Here, all of your pain and loneliness will go away...

788
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:08.832
because Spiritual Father will heal you.

789
00:59:09.098 --> 00:59:11.401
- That's right. - Oh, really?

790
00:59:11.568 --> 00:59:14.404
- Let's go in. - Okay, let's go.

791
00:59:14.771 --> 00:59:16.105
(Guseonwon)

792
00:59:16.806 --> 00:59:17.974
- Hello. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

793
00:59:24.948 --> 00:59:27.016
You must know it too.

794
00:59:27.951 --> 00:59:31.788
Evil energy started to fill up this place.

795
00:59:32.255 --> 00:59:36.092
If we don't purify ourselves of this evil energy soon,

796
00:59:38.361 --> 00:59:39.729
the Boat of Salvation...

797
00:59:40.563 --> 00:59:42.098
might sink.

798
00:59:44.133 --> 00:59:46.002
- Pardon me? - If that happens,

799
00:59:46.269 --> 00:59:48.638
Sang Jin, Sang Mi,

800
00:59:49.138 --> 00:59:50.673
and your wife...

801
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:53.276
won't be able...

802
00:59:55.178 --> 00:59:57.013
to reach the paradise.

803
00:59:57.747 --> 01:00:00.149
Well... Spiritual Father.

804
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:02.685
Is there any way we can prevent it?

805
01:00:03.152 --> 01:00:05.922
After the morning service tomorrow,

806
01:00:06.356 --> 01:00:07.790
Sang Mi and I...

807
01:00:09.192 --> 01:00:11.794
will have our spiritual wedding.

808
01:00:16.733 --> 01:00:17.800
Okay.

809
01:00:19.869 --> 01:00:21.804
To stop the evil energy from growing further,

810
01:00:22.639 --> 01:00:23.773
you must...

811
01:00:25.008 --> 01:00:27.343
prepare for the spiritual wedding as soon as possible.

812
01:00:28.578 --> 01:00:31.114
Okay. Our wishes will be fulfilled.

813
01:01:13.823 --> 01:01:14.991
Apostle Kang.

814
01:01:15.525 --> 01:01:16.759
What did Spiritual Father...

815
01:01:17.694 --> 01:01:19.595
say to you?

816
01:01:20.463 --> 01:01:23.833
He gave me a new revelation...

817
01:01:24.267 --> 01:01:26.269
in regards to the spiritual wedding.

818
01:01:27.737 --> 01:01:28.738
By any chance,

819
01:01:29.572 --> 01:01:31.074
did he say...

820
01:01:32.175 --> 01:01:34.577
that the Boat of Salvation might sink?

821
01:01:38.247 --> 01:01:39.482
Apostle Kang.

822
01:01:40.116 --> 01:01:43.987
Evil energy started filling up this place.

823
01:01:44.887 --> 01:01:48.758
If we don't purify ourselves of this evil energy soon,

824
01:01:49.659 --> 01:01:52.729
the Boat of Salvation might sink.

825
01:01:57.367 --> 01:02:00.470
The spiritual wedding between Yu Ra and I...

826
01:02:02.472 --> 01:02:03.873
should be expedited.

827
01:02:06.175 --> 01:02:07.276
Apostle Kang.

828
01:02:07.777 --> 01:02:10.546
I'll take care of the preparation from now on.

829
01:02:11.247 --> 01:02:14.684
Please continue to pray and help me out.

830
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:28.498
- We believe it! - We believe it!

831
01:02:28.498 --> 01:02:30.099
- Our wishes will be fulfilled! - Our wishes will be fulfilled!

832
01:02:30.099 --> 01:02:31.434
- We believe it! - We believe it!

833
01:02:31.434 --> 01:02:32.869
- Our wishes will be fulfilled! - Our wishes will be fulfilled!

834
01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:34.137
- We believe it! - We believe it!

835
01:02:34.137 --> 01:02:35.138
- Our wishes will be fulfilled! - Our wishes will be fulfilled!

836
01:02:35.138 --> 01:02:36.305
Sang Mi.

837
01:02:38.975 --> 01:02:40.610
Come forward.

838
01:03:06.769 --> 01:03:10.039
Now, the time is here.

839
01:03:10.773 --> 01:03:12.175
Tomorrow at dawn,

840
01:03:13.509 --> 01:03:16.312
you and I...

841
01:03:17.246 --> 01:03:19.582
will have a spiritual wedding...

842
01:03:20.016 --> 01:03:23.152
and become one.

843
01:03:26.422 --> 01:03:27.523
I will be...

844
01:03:29.492 --> 01:03:30.927
at your service.

845
01:03:31.961 --> 01:03:33.229
My savior.

846
01:03:34.597 --> 01:03:35.965
My eternal life.

847
01:03:36.899 --> 01:03:37.900
My...

848
01:03:39.135 --> 01:03:40.236
Spiritual Father.

849
01:04:33.689 --> 01:04:36.425
(Save Me)

850
01:04:36.592 --> 01:04:39.962
You use those who are powerless to fulfill your ambitions.

851
01:04:40.463 --> 01:04:42.231
You're just like the cult leader.

852
01:04:42.565 --> 01:04:44.667
Both you and my dad...

853
01:04:44.667 --> 01:04:46.135
are exactly like that cult leader.

854
01:04:46.135 --> 01:04:48.037
When you're a little older, you'll realize...

855
01:04:48.804 --> 01:04:53.142
that there isn't much difference between what's fake and real.

856
01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:55.811
Is that how you lead your life?

857
01:04:56.479 --> 01:04:58.347
I'll never live like that.

858
01:04:58.347 --> 01:05:00.383
I told you to bring the voice recorder...

859
01:05:00.583 --> 01:05:02.818
if you want to see your mom.

860
01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.621
I think...

861
01:05:06.322 --> 01:05:08.591
she misses you a lot.
