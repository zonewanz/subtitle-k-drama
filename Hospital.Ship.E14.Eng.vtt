<i>[Episode 14]</i>

3
00:00:10.378 --> 00:00:12.233
This is still here.

4
00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.563
I came here 20 years ago with my family.

5
00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:21.516
It was my father, mother, sister, and me.

6
00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:23.501
Let's take a picture!

7
00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:27.795
- Look over here!
- Let's look over there!

8
00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:31.442
- It's ready.
- Hurry on over!

9
00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:34.171
Look at the camera. Let's smile, okay?

10
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:36.028
One, two...

11
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.346
<i>I think it was the first and last time</i>

12
00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:44.171
<i>that our family gathered together
and laughed with joy.</i>

13
00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:50.697
I don't think...
there will be another chance.

14
00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:55.233
It's more like...

15
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.397
I don't have the right.

16
00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:20.949
Did something... happen at the hospital?

17
00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:36.314
- What's...
- A consent form.

18
00:01:37.327 --> 00:01:39.814
A DNR.

19
00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:47.147
Even if we can revive him,
we can't save him.

20
00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.784
I was in a good mood.

21
00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:54.559
He recognized me for once...

22
00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:58.412
and his password is my birthday.

23
00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:02.849
I was... in a really good mood.

24
00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:07.597
But in the end...

25
00:02:07.597 --> 00:02:13.990
my father asked me to kill him,
once again.

26
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.797
That's not true.

27
00:02:15.797 --> 00:02:17.521
This is different.

28
00:02:18.124 --> 00:02:20.759
Asking you for morphine...

29
00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:24.073
and signing a DNR...

30
00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:26.593
I know that.

31
00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:28.170
The problem...

32
00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:31.908
Do you know what the problem is?

33
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.187
It's that I felt relieved.

34
00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:43.706
"What a relief.
Even if his heart stops..."

35
00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:46.794
"I don't have to save him."

36
00:02:48.575 --> 00:02:50.509
- "What a relief."
- Doctor Kwak.

37
00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.473
Do you know what's worse?

38
00:02:53.795 --> 00:02:58.120
I hope... that day will come soon.

39
00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:00.966
It'd be nice...

40
00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:04.830
if it ended sooner than later.

41
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.189
I think I'm thinking this way...

42
00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:14.452
because of my father.

43
00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:22.581
It's not like I take care of him
all day long.

44
00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:27.126
It's only been... two years now.

45
00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:37.463
Do you want to go for round two?

46
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.440
Why are you laughing?

47
00:04:15.082 --> 00:04:16.951
Am I funny to you?

48
00:04:16.951 --> 00:04:20.865
No, I'm laughing at myself.

49
00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:25.533
I wonder who is more frustrated.

50
00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:31.550
You're going crazy because your father
lost himself to dementia.

51
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:36.971
And I'm going crazy
because of my completely sane father.

52
00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:42.151
I wonder who is more frustrated.

53
00:04:53.014 --> 00:04:54.913
My father...

54
00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:58.435
is a con artist.

55
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.644
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:52.554 --> 00:05:54.081
Thank you.

57
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.134
You being here...

58
00:05:59.086 --> 00:06:00.506
has...

59
00:06:02.256 --> 00:06:04.146
comforted me a lot.

60
00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:11.290
What the heck is this happy music?

61
00:07:12.562 --> 00:07:16.160
Geez, let's go.

62
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.480
Hey, the light changed!

63
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.756
Huh? Okay.

64
00:07:45.401 --> 00:07:48.884
- Hello. Hello.
- Doctor Song!

65
00:07:48.884 --> 00:07:50.340
Good morning.

66
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.970
Wait, why...

67
00:07:56.588 --> 00:07:58.901
What's wrong with them?
Are they fighting again?

68
00:08:00.574 --> 00:08:02.810
It doesn't seem that way.

69
00:08:08.701 --> 00:08:13.134
- What are you doing here?
- What else? I'm waiting for you.

70
00:08:13.831 --> 00:08:15.708
Why?

71
00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:17.754
Today is my testing day.

72
00:08:20.884 --> 00:08:25.639
Did you... forget?

73
00:08:28.396 --> 00:08:32.599
You're not Yoo Ah Rim.
Song Eun Jae forgot?

74
00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:35.272
Wow, did something happen?

75
00:08:35.272 --> 00:08:40.209
I can't think of
how this can be explained...

76
00:08:41.476 --> 00:08:44.881
What's the matter? Tell me, okay?

77
00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:46.784
Doctor Song.

78
00:08:56.686 --> 00:08:59.571
What are you doing here?
Are you going to prepare?

79
00:08:59.571 --> 00:09:01.356
The boat hasn't departed yet.

80
00:09:05.605 --> 00:09:08.481
Hey, stop it! It's so noisy.

81
00:09:09.337 --> 00:09:12.426
Something... is going on, isn't it?

82
00:09:13.426 --> 00:09:15.542
Are you having a fling with Doctor Song?

83
00:09:17.102 --> 00:09:19.182
Geez, you're so dirty!

84
00:09:29.613 --> 00:09:31.227
Let's talk.

85
00:09:38.883 --> 00:09:42.745
We drank a lot of alcohol yesterday.
Wine, soju, and beer.

86
00:09:42.745 --> 00:09:47.513
We drank over 10 bottles. We had
blood alcohol levels of over 0.2.

87
00:09:47.513 --> 00:09:49.077
Blood alcohol levels?

88
00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:51.490
We could have had our licenses suspended.

89
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.403
There's a chance we committed unintended
acts due to our compromised states.

90
00:09:55.403 --> 00:09:59.816
And alcohol activated dopamine,
phenylethylamine

91
00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:02.471
oxytocin, and various types of hormones.

92
00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:04.523
- Therefore...
- Therefore?

93
00:10:04.523 --> 00:10:09.158
What happened yesterday, was an accident
that occurred due to chemical reactions

94
00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:10.797
between alcohol and hormones.

95
00:10:13.307 --> 00:10:15.202
I'm relieved.

96
00:10:15.202 --> 00:10:19.292
I was worried that
it meant nothing to you.

97
00:10:19.962 --> 00:10:22.817
That's what I'm talking about.
Right now...

98
00:10:24.466 --> 00:10:27.658
Aren't you nervous and excited?

99
00:10:28.969 --> 00:10:32.052
You're using hormones as an excuse
because you're scared.

100
00:10:44.442 --> 00:10:48.701
- I won't go even if I have to die!
- Geez, seriously!

101
00:10:48.701 --> 00:10:51.620
- It's dangerous! Gosh!
- I said I'm not going!

102
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.053
You have to go to the hospital.

103
00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:55.682
You're full of energy today!

104
00:10:55.682 --> 00:10:57.871
Get lost!

105
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.999
Let's go to the hospital ship!
You need to get acupuncture!

106
00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:03.482
Strike, strike, strike...

107
00:11:03.482 --> 00:11:09.731
Gosh, please go easy on him!
What if you hurt his handsome face?

108
00:11:09.731 --> 00:11:12.558
Geez, what handsome face?

109
00:11:12.558 --> 00:11:15.648
- Grandfather!
- I'm not going!

110
00:11:15.648 --> 00:11:17.089
Hurry.

111
00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:19.450
- Geez!
- He has a fever.

112
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.789
It's 37.6 degrees!

113
00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:24.315
I'm not going anywhere!

114
00:11:24.315 --> 00:11:28.546
Let go of me!
I told you I'm not going!

115
00:11:28.546 --> 00:11:32.596
You can't make me!
I told you I'm not going!

116
00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:35.518
Geez, are you crazy?

117
00:11:35.518 --> 00:11:38.887
Then, I'll die right here!

118
00:11:38.887 --> 00:11:41.100
- Geez!
- Gosh!

119
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.019
Geez, again?
You should just get it over with!

120
00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:50.287
But he can't win against
Manager Choo's stubborn personality!

121
00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:55.393
Hey, I told you to let go of me!
Let go of me!

122
00:11:55.393 --> 00:11:59.225
Geez, please stop!
Manager Choo, escort him in!

123
00:11:59.225 --> 00:12:00.859
Geez.

124
00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:03.876
We're here. Let's go inside.

125
00:12:03.876 --> 00:12:05.923
Hello, come in.

126
00:12:05.923 --> 00:12:07.671
We're here.

127
00:12:07.671 --> 00:12:11.850
I told you I won't do it!
Geez, stop it already!

128
00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.500
Please watch your arm.

129
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.452
- Geez!
- Thank you.

130
00:12:17.452 --> 00:12:18.828
I'm leaving!

131
00:12:18.828 --> 00:12:21.523
You can't...

132
00:12:22.586 --> 00:12:25.303
It's an abscess. If I anesthetize it,
and squeeze out the pus

133
00:12:25.303 --> 00:12:27.337
the pain and swelling will be gone.

134
00:12:27.337 --> 00:12:29.946
- Anesthesia.
- Yes.

135
00:12:29.946 --> 00:12:33.681
Please open wide. Open wide. Open wide.

136
00:12:33.681 --> 00:12:35.970
I'll freeze it now.

137
00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:43.418
Open wide...

138
00:12:43.418 --> 00:12:45.485
Doctor!

139
00:12:45.485 --> 00:12:47.422
Geez, my nose.

140
00:12:51.995 --> 00:12:54.513
Damn it, my nose.

141
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:02.081
- Why is it so noisy? Is there a war?
- You don't have patients, right?

142
00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:04.959
Help me before
my beautiful nose sinks into my face.

143
00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:07.491
- What the heck?
- Hurry.

144
00:13:07.491 --> 00:13:09.828
I got it. Let go of me.

145
00:13:09.828 --> 00:13:13.788
- Help me.
- Fine.

146
00:13:13.788 --> 00:13:16.456
Please stay still.
Let me hold you right here.

147
00:13:20.946 --> 00:13:23.326
Young... Young Master.

148
00:13:23.326 --> 00:13:26.546
- Grandpa.
- "Grandpa?"

149
00:13:34.453 --> 00:13:36.471
This is your house?

150
00:13:47.068 --> 00:13:50.873
Butler? Park Soo Beom
was Jae Geol's family's butler?

151
00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:53.794
- Yes.
- I guess he's really rich after all.

152
00:13:53.794 --> 00:13:56.868
What do butlers do?

153
00:13:56.868 --> 00:14:01.315
They drive, take care of the garden,
and do all sorts of things.

154
00:14:01.315 --> 00:14:06.490
I heard he spent his whole life
where his father lived.

155
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.504
Was that... the doctor
of oriental medicine's house?

156
00:14:09.504 --> 00:14:13.769
- That's what I'm telling you.
- It's a small world, isn't it?

157
00:14:14.364 --> 00:14:17.081
That's what I'm saying. Geez, seriously.

158
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:19.772
What brings you here?
Did you come here to pick up your gown?

159
00:14:19.772 --> 00:14:23.051
You should come home
more often. Why don't...

160
00:14:29.306 --> 00:14:32.114
- Let's talk.
- Where are the keys to the villa?

161
00:14:32.114 --> 00:14:36.019
Why do you need them?
Is this the time to play at the villa?

162
00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:39.631
- Give them to me.
- Fine, I'll give them to you.

163
00:14:39.631 --> 00:14:43.259
I'll give them to you, so come back home
after having fun for the last time.

164
00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:47.028
Why are you living in that small dorm?

165
00:14:47.028 --> 00:14:50.432
Come back home and start studying.
Forget about oriental medicine

166
00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:54.666
and work on becoming a doctor. You
need to inherit your father's hospital.

167
00:14:54.666 --> 00:14:56.269
The keys.

168
00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:08.599
Wow, is this interesting to you?

169
00:15:08.599 --> 00:15:10.582
- Yeah.
- Really?

170
00:15:10.582 --> 00:15:12.791
I guess blood is thicker than water.

171
00:15:13.854 --> 00:15:15.759
- Gosh.
- You punk.

172
00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:19.240
- I don't know what this means.
- This is incredibly difficult.

173
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.865
Is that right?

174
00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:54.121

175
00:16:19.674 --> 00:16:21.799
Wow!

176
00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:25.701
Jae Geol, it's flying
all the way to the ocean!

177
00:16:28.008 --> 00:16:29.635
That's right!

178
00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:32.849
Cheer up, Jae Geol!

179
00:16:34.977 --> 00:16:40.030
One, two, three!

180
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.581
Throw it! That's right! Wow, good job!

181
00:16:44.581 --> 00:16:46.124
Wow!

182
00:16:47.985 --> 00:16:52.357
<i>Wow, look at that! It's flying
all the way to the ocean!</i>

183
00:17:10.265 --> 00:17:12.278
What am I missing?

184
00:17:13.278 --> 00:17:14.931
Is that a cook book?

185
00:17:17.387 --> 00:17:19.051
What's this?

186
00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:27.320
Let's talk.

187
00:17:33.027 --> 00:17:37.133
- We work here.
- Hey, this is our personal space.

188
00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:40.894
The hospital ship provides it,
so it's an extension of work.

189
00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.431
Let's go with that then.

190
00:17:42.431 --> 00:17:45.365
I'm not in the mood for jokes.
Listen to me seriously.

191
00:17:47.536 --> 00:17:50.047
We're colleagues
who work on the hospital ship

192
00:17:50.047 --> 00:17:53.011
and as a doctor, I'm your superior.

193
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:56.743
We're supposed to work at our workplace.
If you want a deeper relationship

194
00:17:56.743 --> 00:18:00.875
we can no longer continue
as colleagues, which is why...

195
00:18:00.875 --> 00:18:04.322
Is this the wall
that you don't me to cross?

196
00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:06.556
That's right.

197
00:18:07.751 --> 00:18:11.163
I got it. If that's what you want.

198
00:18:11.163 --> 00:18:14.713
But, remember this.

199
00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:19.105
This might not be a wall, but a door.

200
00:18:20.574 --> 00:18:24.186
So you can open it whenever you're ready.

201
00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.882
I'll be waiting on the other side.

202
00:19:26.644 --> 00:19:32.516
<i>From the foolish mother
who took away all her daughter's time</i>

203
00:19:32.516 --> 00:19:34.529
<i>to find love.</i>

204
00:20:08.682 --> 00:20:12.030
The reason why I asked everyone
to gather here today

205
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:16.708
is because Kang Jung Ho finished
his treatment and came back

206
00:20:16.708 --> 00:20:19.067
so we're here to congratulate him!

207
00:20:23.776 --> 00:20:26.519
- That's why!
- Welcome.

208
00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:30.261
Thank you.
Doctor Song, thank you so much.

209
00:20:30.261 --> 00:20:33.499
Thanks to you, I'm able to hold my baby.

210
00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:34.949
Thank you.

211
00:20:34.949 --> 00:20:37.483
Ji Hyun, give her the present.

212
00:20:42.778 --> 00:20:45.462
Doctor, thank you very much.

213
00:20:45.462 --> 00:20:48.444
- Thank you.
- What are you doing?

214
00:20:48.444 --> 00:20:51.808
Escort them to the cafeteria!

215
00:20:51.808 --> 00:20:54.875
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Thank you.

216
00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:57.601
- Thank you.
- Attention! Attention!

217
00:20:57.601 --> 00:20:59.285
There's one more thing!

218
00:20:59.285 --> 00:21:03.181
- Jun Ho, tell her to come in.
- Yes.

219
00:21:03.181 --> 00:21:05.358
Please come inside.

220
00:21:05.358 --> 00:21:06.843
Good.

221
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.582
Let me introduce our new guest.

222
00:21:16.582 --> 00:21:21.297
As an artist who just got back
from studying art in New York

223
00:21:21.297 --> 00:21:25.079
she said she is planning
a private exhibition on Geojedo

224
00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:28.576
and the topic will be centered
around the hospital ship.

225
00:21:28.576 --> 00:21:30.498
Please introduce yourself.

226
00:21:31.746 --> 00:21:35.577
Hello, I'm Artist Choi Young Eun.

227
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.171
And she offered to donate her profit

228
00:21:41.171 --> 00:21:45.326
for the treatments
of the the island residents!

229
00:21:45.326 --> 00:21:48.036
Please give her a round of applause!

230
00:21:48.036 --> 00:21:49.853
Thank you!

231
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.865
It's been a long time.
Who knew we'd meet here, Doctor Kwak?

232
00:22:02.178 --> 00:22:03.511
I know, right?

233
00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:17.835
She's really pretty. How do you know her?
What's your relationship with her?

234
00:22:17.835 --> 00:22:20.540
Why are you so curious about everything?

235
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.392
If you're bored, look at the patients'
charts instead of making mistakes again.

236
00:22:24.392 --> 00:22:26.565
Hey, why are you annoyed at me?

237
00:22:30.693 --> 00:22:32.960
<i>- Nurse.
- What is it this time?</i>

238
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.010
<i>Who is she? How do they know each other?</i>

239
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.073
<i>Why are you so curious?</i>

240
00:22:38.073 --> 00:22:41.030
<i>Is she... my rival?</i>

241
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.791
<i>- What do you mean?
- Didn't I tell you?</i>

242
00:22:44.791 --> 00:22:48.324
<i>I like Doctor Kwak.</i>

243
00:22:48.324 --> 00:22:51.270
<i>What? Why?</i>

244
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.399
<i>Because he's sexy.</i>

245
00:22:53.399 --> 00:22:56.624
<i>I managed to snag a seat on the bus</i>

246
00:22:56.624 --> 00:23:01.447
<i>and that's when I realized
he was the one I looked for...</i>

247
00:23:01.447 --> 00:23:04.929
<i>Gosh, Nurse Yoo, you have an illness.</i>

248
00:23:04.929 --> 00:23:08.010
<i>- An illness?
- How long has it been since you cried</i>

249
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:12.499
<i>after your friend stole your boyfriend?
But you're in love again?</i>

250
00:23:12.499 --> 00:23:14.655
<i>That's why I fell in love.</i>

251
00:23:14.655 --> 00:23:18.480
<i>Love is the best Band-aid
for wounds caused by love.</i>

252
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.069
<i>- Band-aid.
- "Band-aid."</i>

253
00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:26.237
<i>Nurse, I'm serious.</i>

254
00:23:32.505 --> 00:23:34.663
Let me see your arm.

255
00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:37.020
Miss, show me your arm.

256
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:40.807
You need to show it to me
so I can treat it.

257
00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:45.079
If you were going be so stubborn,
why did you come here?

258
00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:47.133
Can't you speak Korean?

259
00:23:47.133 --> 00:23:51.249
Do you speak Korean? Yes or no?

260
00:23:51.249 --> 00:23:54.903
If not, do you speak English?

261
00:23:54.903 --> 00:23:57.313
Can you speak it or not?

262
00:24:04.534 --> 00:24:06.111
What's the matter?

263
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:09.346
I think she hurt her arm,
but she won't talk.

264
00:24:11.373 --> 00:24:13.490
She's talking right now.

265
00:24:15.727 --> 00:24:17.925
She is, isn't she?

266
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.884
<i>Why don't you want to be treated?</i>

267
00:24:22.884 --> 00:24:24.972
<i>I didn't come here for myself.</i>

268
00:24:24.972 --> 00:24:26.238
<i>Then?</i>

269
00:24:26.238 --> 00:24:28.491
<i>My child is sick.</i>

270
00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:30.778
<i>Where's your child?</i>

271
00:24:30.778 --> 00:24:33.510
<i>At home.</i>

272
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:38.851
<i>Don't worry. I can help your child.</i>

273
00:24:55.209 --> 00:24:56.846
It's that face.

274
00:24:58.721 --> 00:25:03.428
It was that expression
on my man's face that I missed so much.

275
00:25:05.257 --> 00:25:07.598
Your man?

276
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.030
I guess you didn't know.
Doctor Kwak and I are engaged.

277

<i>- Why is your room so empty?
- I'm going to sleep with Hyun.</i>

<i>It could be a heart attack,

<i>Mom, wake up! Mom!</i>

285
