<i>[Episode 13]</i>

3
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:18.213
<i>One cannot choose their parents.</i>

4
00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:21.494
<i>And things that are happening because
of factors out of my control</i>

5
00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:23.424
<i>are not my responsibility.</i>

6
00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:28.168
I knew this would look good here, too.

7
00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:32.976
Isn't it pretty?
I did a good job, right?

8
00:00:32.976 --> 00:00:36.224
<i>I used to think that my mom was
the prettiest person in the world.</i>

9
00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:37.830
Why are you staring at me like that?

10
00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:42.184
Is it because I'm still pretty?

11
00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:45.997
<i>Mom always downgraded
herself for Dad's sake.</i>

12
00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:52.143
I'm happy...

13
00:00:52.676 --> 00:00:56.851
because your dad
loves me so much.

14
00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:04.894
What does it matter
if you're still pretty?

15
00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:08.278
Of course it's important.

16
00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:09.855
Stop it.
That's gross.

17
00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:13.283
What's so gross about it, when
I'm your mom and you're my son?

18
00:01:13.283 --> 00:01:14.608
I gave birth to you.

19
00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:17.455
Do you think there's anyone in this world
who loves you more than I do?

20
00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:18.721
Yeah, I think there is.

21
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:20.893
Hey.
No, there isn't.

22
00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:23.495
Love between men and women
only last a short while.

23
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:24.825
I know that very, very well.

24
00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:27.030
It's all over once you break up.

25
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.873
You know that so well, and yet
you choose to live your life like this?

26
00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:31.586
What's wrong with how
I live my life?

27
00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:35.062
Do you think that it's easy to be
happy, for even a short while?

28
00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:38.897
Why do you have such
negative opinions about me?

29
00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:41.896
I mean, I do admit that I've
caused a lot of trouble in the past.

30
00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:43.813
But I'm not like that anymore.

31
00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:47.093
Doesn't the child usually cause trouble
and the parent cleans up the mess?

32
00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:50.096
But we don't have an
average relationship.

33
00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:51.399
We're special.

34
00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.268
It's so unique and nice,
don't you think?

35
00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.477
<i>[Mine]</i>

36
00:01:56.477 --> 00:01:58.524
Oh, it's Daniel.
I guess he's here.

37
00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:01.064
Yeah, it's me.

38
00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:02.279
Okay!

39
00:02:02.774 --> 00:02:05.301
Yeah, I'm heading downstairs now.
Okay!

40
00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:09.778
<i>The person she's lowering herself
for now is the man who just called her.</i>

41
00:02:09.778 --> 00:02:11.636
<i>Not my dad.</i>

42
00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:19.542
What brings you here?

43
00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:20.774
Ah.

44

<i>[A French Chef's Comforting
and Delicious Food]</i>

46
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:41.047
Yoon Seon showed this to me, saying
that you were featured in an article.

47
00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:44.570
<i>He's not the same dad I remember him
being when he was young.</i>

48
00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:47.554
Your younger siblings want to meet you.

49
00:02:47.554 --> 00:02:51.391
Let's have a family get-together here
around the end of the year.

50
00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:55.016
All right.

51
00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:57.696
Your mother is doing well, I presume?

52
00:03:02.608 --> 00:03:05.092
There are just some people
who aren't compatible.

53
00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:07.510
Your mother and I were like that.

54
00:03:08.432 --> 00:03:11.732
<i>His excuse for his physical abuse
is just too pathetic.</i>

55
00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:14.934
I need to go now.

56
00:03:24.373 --> 00:03:26.564
Don't sell the land that your
grandpa gave you.

57

<i>I don't feel good when
I see my parents.</i>

58
00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:34.418
<i>They make me feel uneasy.
And that is difficult for me.</i>

59
00:03:34.418 --> 00:03:35.989
<i>And because it's difficult,
I avoid them.</i>

60
00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.799
<i>I go a little overboard because
I don't want to avoid them.</i>

61
00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.703
<i>And I suppress my desires because
I don't want to go overboard.</i>

62
00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:41.744
<i>That is who I am.</i>

63

<i>[Temperature of Love]</i>

64
00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:57.759
<i>The results were bad, and the director
is saying that the script is the issue</i>

65
00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.838
<i>so there's nothing much
that I can do.</i>

66
00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:01.924
<i>To be honest...</i>

67
00:04:03.407 --> 00:04:05.004
I'm scared.

68
00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:06.862
Look forward.

69
00:04:06.862 --> 00:04:09.395
That way, you'll be able to
get up again, even if you fall.

70
00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:11.511
- Congratulations.
- Hyun Soo!

<i>and the actor left, saying that he
wouldn't participate in the shoot.</i>

74
00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:21.761
What are you hoping to accomplish by
meeting up with Shin Ha Rim at this hour?

75
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.213
What else? I have to get him
back on the set.

76
00:04:24.213 --> 00:04:25.460
Do you think that'll be easy?

77
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.523
I'm sure it'll be hard.

78
00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:28.710
That's why I'm going to him.

79
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.860
Ugh, you're at it again.
You're giving me the creeps.

80
00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.025
Go. I'll leave after I see you
get into your car.

81
00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:35.836
Oh, here it comes.

82
00:04:35.836 --> 00:04:37.648
But, where are you headed?

83
00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:39.376
I'm going to make my decision
after I make a call.

84
00:04:40.701 --> 00:04:42.081
Did you get yourself a woman?

85
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:43.484
Huh?

86
00:04:44.775 --> 00:04:48.396
Stop checking on whether or not I got
a woman, and get yourself one!

87
00:04:48.396 --> 00:04:50.961
When are you finally going
to introduce me to your future wife?

88
00:04:54.937 --> 00:04:57.787
Wait just a little bit.
It won't be much longer.

89
00:04:57.787 --> 00:05:00.155
You're speaking like someone who's
already seeing someone.

90
00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.872
Wait just a little longer.

91

<i>[Ohn Jung Seon]</i>

92
00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:30.552
Hello?

93
00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:32.448
Where are you?

94
00:05:33.247 --> 00:05:34.711
At home.

95
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:36.787
Text me your address.

96
00:05:37.612 --> 00:05:38.713
Why?

97
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.465
I ran into Jung Woo.

98
00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:44.703
At the very least, we can wish
the best for each other.

99
00:05:45.794 --> 00:05:48.502
I'm not going to cling to you
asking you to date me anymore.

100
00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:51.162
So there's no need for you to
draw boundaries like this.

101
00:05:52.278 --> 00:05:54.737
So, you're not going to
tell me your address, then?

102
00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:56.658
Who said that I wasn't
going to tell you?

103
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.415
That's my outfit.

104
00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:04.744
Oh, this is no good.
I should put some makeup on.

105
00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:11.037
That'd be going totally overboard.

106
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.732
What is wrong with you?

107
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.175
Do you know what kind of
situation you're in?

108
00:06:33.535 --> 00:06:36.386
Is it okay for you to be meeting with
a man in a situation like this?

109
00:06:37.222 --> 00:06:38.728
Yeah, it's okay!

110
00:06:40.244 --> 00:06:42.865
But the guy doesn't want
anything like that with you anymore.

111
00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:50.304
I'm scared.

112
00:06:53.732 --> 00:06:55.725
Hey, what are you doing?

113
00:07:08.448 --> 00:07:09.780
You're scared?

114
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.694
What are you imagining?

115
00:07:17.694 --> 00:07:20.763
I'm not imagining anything.

116
00:07:21.434 --> 00:07:23.107
Did you have dinner?

117
00:07:23.727 --> 00:07:24.819
Not yet.

118
00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:29.660
Get some rest.
I'll make you something delicious.

119
00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:35.093
<i>[Good Soup]</i>

120
00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:42.314
Sorry. Something suddenly came up,
so I can't have dinner with you.

121
00:07:43.895 --> 00:07:45.619
I thought you said that
you'd congratulate me.

122
00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:46.850
I'll wait.

123
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.276
Sorry, don't wait up for me.

124
00:07:48.276 --> 00:07:49.960
I'll make you something
delicious later.

125
00:07:51.353 --> 00:07:53.042
Do you want to place your order?

126
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:56.703
No thanks, Soo Jung.

127
00:07:56.703 --> 00:08:00.025
Would you like me to get you
anything while you wait, then?

128
00:08:00.687 --> 00:08:03.155
No, I'm going to go.

129
00:08:09.367 --> 00:08:11.451
I was at the studio this whole time.

130
00:08:13.646 --> 00:08:15.948
I have instant rice, too.

131
00:08:15.948 --> 00:08:17.398
Hm.

132
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.166
Do you have any cellophane
noodles, by any chance?

133
00:09:00.538 --> 00:09:01.624
Wow!

134
00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.864
Wow, that's amazing. This is all
from stuff that was in my fridge?

135
00:09:04.864 --> 00:09:06.214
I told you, don't touch anything!

136
00:09:06.214 --> 00:09:08.884
Come over and eat
when I'm done plating!

137
00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:10.777
I can't do that.

138
00:09:10.777 --> 00:09:12.529
What are you planning to do?

139
00:09:15.937 --> 00:09:17.125
Ow, that's hot.

140
00:09:33.543 --> 00:09:36.017
I have to save stuff like this
as a memory.

141
00:09:38.365 --> 00:09:39.798
One, two, three!

142
00:09:46.427 --> 00:09:48.148
It's nothing much, really.

143
00:09:48.148 --> 00:09:50.938
Something that's nothing
to you, Chef Ohn Jung Seon

144
00:09:50.938 --> 00:09:53.090
is something that is
quite special to me.

145
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:56.868
Okay.

146
00:10:01.488 --> 00:10:03.028
You took a photo of that, too?

147
00:10:03.028 --> 00:10:05.050
Of course! You're the one
who made it, after all.

148
00:10:09.135 --> 00:10:11.515
All right, go ahead and tell me now.

149
00:10:11.515 --> 00:10:14.036
I can't solve your problems,
but I'll lend you an ear.

150
00:10:14.036 --> 00:10:15.769
Hm.

151
00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:18.028
First, I'll tell you the
facts that I know

152
00:10:18.028 --> 00:10:21.233
since I feel like they'll be difficult
for you to say yourself.

153
00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:24.725
The broadcasting company
brought a new writer on board

154
00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:27.384
- and the actor said he wouldn't...
- shoot, and he left the set.

155
00:10:27.384 --> 00:10:30.942
The articles about it are quite
scathing, and so are the comments.

156
00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:32.662
They're telling me to quit writing.

157
00:10:33.937 --> 00:10:37.427
It makes me feel better to say the things
that are difficult to say myself.

158
00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:42.975
Oh.
I see.

159
00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.408
Yes, that's how it is.

160
00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:49.330
That's why I'm miserable...

161
00:10:50.197 --> 00:10:52.201
and sad...

162
00:10:52.966 --> 00:10:54.624
and in pain.

163
00:10:57.114 --> 00:10:58.898
If you want to cry, then cry.

164
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.399
Oh geez, then I'll really...

165
00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.936
Oh, I'm crying.

166
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.656
Oh, someone's here.

167
00:11:15.355 --> 00:11:16.898
I feel a bit better now.

168
00:11:19.409 --> 00:11:21.491
Your emotions are so capricious.

169
00:11:29.797 --> 00:11:31.145
Why are you here?

170
00:11:33.182 --> 00:11:35.031
Come in, Hong Ah.

171
00:11:46.142 --> 00:11:48.294
You must be lucky when it
comes to eating food.

172
00:11:48.294 --> 00:11:50.887
Mr. Jung Seon made this food.
Isn't it amazing?

173
00:11:50.887 --> 00:11:53.096
He used kimchi, frozen
dumplings, and sausages to...

174
00:11:53.096 --> 00:11:54.725
Wow, you definitely seem chipper.

175
00:11:56.937 --> 00:11:59.613
Oh... I forgot about it
for a bit.

176
00:12:04.254 --> 00:12:06.404
Let's eat now.
Take a seat.

177
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.452
Is this your house?
Why are you telling me to sit?

178
00:12:11.377 --> 00:12:13.657
I know about this house
better than you do.

179
00:12:14.393 --> 00:12:16.430
Then sit, or stand.
Do as your please.

180
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.158
Where should I sit?

181
00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.663
Um... you can sit wherever.

182
00:12:39.037 --> 00:12:41.387
Hey, can't we make this
a bit saltier?

183
00:12:41.387 --> 00:12:43.769
Kimchi stew tastes best
when it's spicy and salty.

184
00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:45.162
No, it's nighttime.

185
00:12:45.162 --> 00:12:47.961
Your face will be swollen tomorrow if
you eat something salty and spicy.

186
00:12:47.961 --> 00:12:49.864
It's fine. I have nowhere to be tomorrow.

187
00:12:54.378 --> 00:12:55.412
Where are you going?

188
00:12:55.412 --> 00:12:57.885
I'll make you a salty and spicy
version with the leftovers.

189
00:12:57.885 --> 00:13:00.385
No, stop it!
There's no need to do all that!

190
00:13:00.385 --> 00:13:02.052
It's no big deal.

191
00:13:04.057 --> 00:13:05.637
I'm leaving.

192
00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:09.682
But you like spicy things, too.
Eat some before you go.

193
00:13:09.682 --> 00:13:11.633
No, Hyun Soo.
I'll be leaving.

194
00:13:16.682 --> 00:13:19.769
You look like you're in a bad mood.
Did something happen?

195
00:13:20.715 --> 00:13:21.811
Yeah.

196
00:13:22.486 --> 00:13:25.827
You and I should be feeling exactly
the opposite of how we're feeling now

197
00:13:25.827 --> 00:13:27.562
based on our
current situations.

198
00:13:30.866 --> 00:13:32.417
Are you sleeping over?

199
00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:33.704
No.

200
00:13:34.719 --> 00:13:36.918
Why are you answering for him?

201
00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:46.778
You two suit each other.

202
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.855
Hey, why...

203
00:14:26.855 --> 00:14:28.610
Step outside, all of you.

204
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.989
I have something to discuss
with Mr. Shin Ha Rim.

205
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.221
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

206
00:14:35.221 --> 00:14:36.345
Sit down!

207
00:14:38.183 --> 00:14:40.509
Who do you think you are,
telling them to leave?

208
00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:42.735
Senior.

209
00:14:44.594 --> 00:14:46.954
You have to go back to the set.

210
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:48.340
Wow, Jung Woo.

211
00:14:50.512 --> 00:14:54.536
You sure have matured a lot, huh?

212
00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:01.318
What are you doing?
Get out, already.

213
00:15:04.387 --> 00:15:06.922
Hey, look at me.

214
00:15:13.643 --> 00:15:14.730
Let go.

215
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.768
I'll overlook one slap
since you're older than me.

216
00:15:27.346 --> 00:15:28.933
Take a seat.

217
00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:34.143
Do you think I'll go just
because you're doing this?

218
00:15:34.143 --> 00:15:37.523
I did some research
about you, Senior.

219
00:15:37.523 --> 00:15:40.557
So what?
You think that'll scare me?

220
00:15:42.005 --> 00:15:44.845
I saw that you hit someone with your
car while under the influence.

221
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.768
You think that you covered up
that incident, don't you?

222
00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:54.336
But the victims don't feel
the same way you do.

223
00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:56.682
It's a time bomb that will
explode sooner or later.

224
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:01.387
And I could be the one to
push the button.

225

<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E13 Temperature of Love "What Are You Doing Here?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

226
00:16:24.086 --> 00:16:26.297
Escort him to the set.

227
00:16:37.739 --> 00:16:40.053
Even the tea is perfect.

228
00:16:40.889 --> 00:16:43.308
Don't think about anything,
just get a good night's sleep.

229
00:16:46.393 --> 00:16:48.084
Um...

230
00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:51.519
Can I ask you something?

231
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.805
It may be a touchy subject, though.

232
00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:55.465
Our restaurant is in the red.

233
00:16:56.789 --> 00:16:58.215
What?

234
00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.825
That wasn't what I was
going to ask you.

235
00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:04.815
It's in the red?
What are you going to do?

236
00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:07.532
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

237
00:17:07.532 --> 00:17:09.031
So, what did you want to ask?

238
00:17:12.562 --> 00:17:15.052
About Hong Ah.

239
00:17:18.945 --> 00:17:21.081
What kind of relationship
do you have with Hong Ah?

240
00:17:21.645 --> 00:17:24.008
What do you mean, what kind of
relationship? We're friends.

241
00:17:24.694 --> 00:17:27.084
Oh... friends, huh?

242
00:17:27.084 --> 00:17:30.003
Are you sure that both of you
would agree with that sentiment?

243
00:17:30.003 --> 00:17:32.322
What do you mean by that, exactly?

244
00:17:32.913 --> 00:17:36.860
Neither one of you wants more
than just being friends?

245
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.453
Oh. Well, we've never talked about it.

246
00:17:41.734 --> 00:17:45.264
But why would two friends
need to be in agreement of that fact?

247
00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:47.633
It's not like we were dating,
and then broke up.

248
00:17:51.303 --> 00:17:52.848
Yeah.

249
00:17:52.848 --> 00:17:55.339
I feel the same way.

250
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.303
Yes, CEO Park?

251
00:18:03.303 --> 00:18:05.512
What are you up to?

252
00:18:05.512 --> 00:18:07.443
My friend came over, so
we're hanging out.

253
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.544
Wow, as to be expected of you.

254
00:18:11.335 --> 00:18:12.849
Did something happen?

255
00:18:12.849 --> 00:18:15.020
No, you two have fun.

256
00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.000
I got Shin Ha Rim to
go back to the set.

257
00:18:18.953 --> 00:18:20.993
Oh, really?
That's great!

258
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:23.568
Sweet dreams, then!

259
00:18:29.743 --> 00:18:31.716
"Sweet dreams"?

260
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.013
Was that Jung Woo?

261
00:18:36.562 --> 00:18:38.414
Seems like he got Shin Ha Rim
back to the set.

262
00:18:38.414 --> 00:18:40.041
How did you know?

263
00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:42.644
I should get going now, too.

264
00:18:43.525 --> 00:18:44.988
Okay.

265
00:18:44.988 --> 00:18:47.168
Thanks so much for today.

266
00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.061
For what?

267
00:18:53.127 --> 00:18:54.896
I don't want to say.

268
00:18:58.589 --> 00:18:59.686
Ow!

269
00:20:04.148 --> 00:20:05.601
Are you happy?

270
00:20:15.735 --> 00:20:18.919
So, the thing that "suddenly came up"
was plans with Hyun Soo?

271
00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:21.610
How could you do this to me?

272
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.365
After all I did for you?

273
00:20:24.365 --> 00:20:26.936
And what did you do, exactly?

274
00:20:26.936 --> 00:20:29.803
I've never told you to
do anything for me.

275
00:20:30.754 --> 00:20:31.973
So?

276
00:20:31.973 --> 00:20:33.837
Are you saying that
what you did was right?

277
00:20:33.837 --> 00:20:36.615
I already apologized to you
for canceling our plans.

278
00:20:36.615 --> 00:20:40.060
If you're getting mad at me for ditching
you to see Hyun Soo, I understand.

279
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.148
You understand?
Then why are you so unapologetic?

280
00:20:43.148 --> 00:20:45.551
People have these things
in life called priorities.

281
00:20:46.533 --> 00:20:48.570
You were pushed aside by
a greater priority.

282
00:20:49.436 --> 00:20:52.783
I don't understand! Why should
I be a lesser priority than Hyun Soo?

283
00:20:52.783 --> 00:20:55.069
Everyone else is a lesser
priority to me than Hyun Soo.

284
00:20:57.649 --> 00:20:59.725
You know how I feel about you.

285
00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:03.132
You know why I hang
around you so much.

286
00:21:03.132 --> 00:21:05.301
And you know how I feel, too.

287
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.398
I've never done anything to indicate
otherwise, as far as I can remember.

288
00:21:13.597 --> 00:21:15.318
Have I?

289
00:21:18.004 --> 00:21:19.366
No.

290
00:21:20.908 --> 00:21:23.462
I take no responsibility
for how you feel.

291
00:21:23.462 --> 00:21:26.696
You have to take responsibility
for your own feelings.

292
00:21:27.813 --> 00:21:30.170
Stop emotionally abusing me.

293
00:21:31.659 --> 00:21:33.005
"Abuse"?

294
00:21:33.868 --> 00:21:36.490
My love is abuse to you?

295
00:21:37.383 --> 00:21:39.013
Hey, you son of a bitch!

296
00:21:39.013 --> 00:21:40.727
Is that all you can say?

297
00:21:40.727 --> 00:21:42.774
Can't you be a bit nicer to me about it?

298
00:21:44.882 --> 00:21:47.063
I have sympathy for you.

299
00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:50.638
We can still get along, as long
as you don't cross the line.

300
00:21:52.198 --> 00:21:53.359
You...

301
00:21:53.359 --> 00:21:56.006
Do you know what kind of day
today was, for me?

302
00:21:56.562 --> 00:21:58.640
Today, I got what I wanted
more than anything else.

303
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.882
And I wanted you to be the
first one to congratulate me!

304
00:22:02.379 --> 00:22:04.137
And yet, you're being
this cruel to me?

305
00:22:05.202 --> 00:22:06.891
Can't you just lie?

306
00:22:06.891 --> 00:22:08.935
You can't even lie for my sake?

307
00:22:09.562 --> 00:22:11.332
I thought you said you had
sympathy for me.

308
00:22:11.332 --> 00:22:12.833
Is this all your sympathy
amounts to?

309
00:22:20.437 --> 00:22:24.025
I'll make you regret how you treated me.

310
00:22:25.523 --> 00:22:30.474
I'll make you see just how
foolish you were to not choose me.

<i>[Won Joon]</i>

318
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.875
Yeah, Won Joon?

319
00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:24.370
I saw I had a missed call from you.

320
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.005
I have an interview for an article today

321
00:23:26.005 --> 00:23:27.910
so I need you to take care
of the morning prep.

322
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.697
You sure are busy, Chef.

323
00:23:29.697 --> 00:23:32.490
It's all because of business
arrangements, Sous Chef.

324
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.074
We'll be doing the interview
at Good Soup, though.

325
00:23:36.477 --> 00:23:38.365
I'll make the coffee.

326
00:23:38.365 --> 00:23:41.302
Just sit down and enjoy the coffee
I made, for the first time in a while.

327
00:23:42.486 --> 00:23:44.234
Hyun Soo.

328
00:23:44.234 --> 00:23:46.293
Why did you send out the script
for episode 9?

329
00:23:46.293 --> 00:23:48.200
Another writer is already working on it.

330
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.082
I thought about it objectively.

331
00:23:51.082 --> 00:23:53.227
Even though they were assigned to
it so suddenly, they made the story flow.

332
00:23:53.332 --> 00:23:55.080
I don't know who the writer is

333
00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.573
but it'll be easier for them
to write if they have my script.

334
00:23:58.573 --> 00:24:01.248
Why'd you go through
all that trouble?

335
00:24:01.248 --> 00:24:02.593
Come on, Hyun Soo!

336
00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:05.953
Here, drink up.
It is really good.

337
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.185
It already smells amazing.

338
00:24:10.798 --> 00:24:12.580
Oh, I think it's Hong Ah.

339
00:24:14.288 --> 00:24:17.051
Writer Ji!
What brings you here?

340
00:24:17.051 --> 00:24:19.795
It's rare to see you come in
so early in the morning.

341
00:24:20.935 --> 00:24:22.680
I came to get my things.

342
00:24:25.352 --> 00:24:28.023
Oh... really?

343
00:24:28.023 --> 00:24:29.526
Yeah, Hyun Soo.

344
00:24:29.526 --> 00:24:31.668
I can't be an assistant
writer anymore, after all.

345
00:24:31.668 --> 00:24:33.695
Hey, but still!

346
00:24:33.695 --> 00:24:35.965
It's not like you'll start working
on something right away.

347
00:24:35.965 --> 00:24:37.630
How can you just
leave like this?

348
00:24:38.674 --> 00:24:41.964
I haven't been much help to Hyun Soo
despite being here all this time, anyway.

349
00:24:41.964 --> 00:24:43.791
That's true, but...

350
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:47.465
it's kind of not right for you to drop
out now, in the middle of all this!

351
00:24:47.465 --> 00:24:49.988
No, Hong Ah.
Go ahead and do that.

352
00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:51.340
Do what you want to do.

353
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.192
"Do what you want to do" isn't
the same as "it's okay if you leave."

354
00:24:55.792 --> 00:24:58.474
You want to hear me to tell you that
it's okay for you to leave?

355
00:25:01.825 --> 00:25:03.888
I'll... I'll help you.

356
00:25:04.584 --> 00:25:06.596
No, I'll take care of it.

357
00:25:06.596 --> 00:25:09.033
I don't want to hear you say
that I took advantage of you.

358
00:25:09.033 --> 00:25:10.219
What?

359
00:25:10.997 --> 00:25:13.032
What's wrong with you?
Seriously?

360
00:25:19.016 --> 00:25:20.969
Aren't you being a bit too much?

361
00:25:20.969 --> 00:25:23.167
No, not at all.

362
00:25:23.167 --> 00:25:25.981
Life is about taking the path
that's best for you.

363
00:25:25.981 --> 00:25:26.988
Who will help me if I lose my chance

364
00:25:26.988 --> 00:25:28.693
because I'm too busy
considering someone else's feelings?

365
00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:31.183
You should say that kind of thing after
you've actually been considerate.

366
00:25:31.183 --> 00:25:32.957
It's not like you've
ever been considerate.

367
00:25:34.379 --> 00:25:36.564
You need to get your head on straight.

368
00:25:36.564 --> 00:25:40.228
Judging from how things are going,
Hyun Soo will be fired soon.

369
00:25:41.892 --> 00:25:43.875
Come with me.

370
00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.022
What?

371
00:25:45.022 --> 00:25:47.313
I'll pay you more than
what Hyun Soo pays you.

372
00:25:47.313 --> 00:25:48.937
Be my assistant writer.

373
00:25:49.196 --> 00:25:51.039
Wow.

374
00:25:52.168 --> 00:25:53.840
Leave, you wench!

375
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.990
I was trying to understand you since
we spent all that time together.

376
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.804
But I really can't understand you!

377
00:25:58.804 --> 00:26:01.976
Never mind, then!
Why are you freaking out so much?

378
00:26:02.792 --> 00:26:05.241
Hey, aren't you taking this?

379
00:26:07.442 --> 00:26:08.475
<i>[Rooibos & Lemongrass]</i>

380
00:26:08.475 --> 00:26:10.253
<i>It's not good to get
addicted to anything.</i>

381
00:26:10.253 --> 00:26:13.298
Just because you like
the tea I blended for you

382
00:26:13.298 --> 00:26:15.202
doesn't mean you should be so
dependent on it to help you fall asleep.

383
00:26:17.241 --> 00:26:18.850
You and Hyun Soo can drink it.

384
00:26:20.158 --> 00:26:22.443
You were always so selfish about
sharing it no matter how much I begged

385
00:26:22.443 --> 00:26:23.894
so why are you being nice
all of the sudden?

386
00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:28.517
Is this truly an act of
kindness, I wonder?

387
00:26:34.395 --> 00:26:35.981
I'll be leaving now,
Hyun Soo.

388
00:26:35.981 --> 00:26:37.285
We need to talk.

389
00:26:40.323 --> 00:26:42.783
Can you step out for a second, Kyung?

390
00:26:42.783 --> 00:26:44.469
Um, sure.
Just a moment.

391
00:26:51.081 --> 00:26:52.231
Talk about what?

392
00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:54.467
I'm tired because I couldn't
sleep at all last night.

393
00:26:55.512 --> 00:26:57.526
There's something that
I was curious about.

394
00:26:57.995 --> 00:26:59.948
Do you really need to keep me here
to satiate your curiosity

395
00:26:59.948 --> 00:27:02.123
when I just told you that I'm tired?

396
00:27:02.123 --> 00:27:03.937
Why are you being so hostile?

397
00:27:03.937 --> 00:27:06.459
You've been like this since you came
to my house last night.

398
00:27:08.494 --> 00:27:12.831
Is Mr. Jung Seon part of the reason why
you're acting like this?

399
00:27:14.612 --> 00:27:17.590
Why would Jung Seon be part of
the reason why I feel like this?

400
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:20.933
Because everything you've done to me...

401
00:27:21.554 --> 00:27:24.979
makes perfect sense if
you like Mr. Jung Seon.

402
00:27:24.979 --> 00:27:27.092
Why would I like someone like him?

403
00:27:27.092 --> 00:27:29.446
Do you think he and I suit each other?

404
00:27:29.446 --> 00:27:32.197
I think that you two suit each other
well in every way.

405
00:27:35.541 --> 00:27:37.994
If Mr. Jung Seon likes you too, that is.

406
00:27:40.298 --> 00:27:43.457
Did he tell you everything, and
how he turned me down?

407
00:27:43.457 --> 00:27:45.657
And did he tell you not to
worry because of that?

408
00:27:46.323 --> 00:27:48.596
You're so terrible.

409
00:27:48.596 --> 00:27:52.485
You don't care at all about how I feel
just because Jung Seon likes you?

410
00:27:52.485 --> 00:27:54.270
Do you not care about our
friendship at all

411
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.839
just because you've gone
crazy over some man?

412
00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:57.679
- Hong Ah!
- Well, you've won!

413
00:28:00.282 --> 00:28:02.659
You've one-upped me in
every way now.

414
00:28:04.409 --> 00:28:06.515
But things will be different
from now on.

415
00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:40.923
- Less flash, please.
- All right.

416
00:28:41.767 --> 00:28:44.757
- Don't be so nervous, Chef.
- Ah.

417
00:28:55.224 --> 00:28:56.788
- Min Ho!
- Yes?

418
00:28:56.788 --> 00:28:59.508
Can you make the macadamia puree?
You saw me do it last time.

419
00:28:59.508 --> 00:29:00.917
Yes, I can do it.

420
00:29:00.917 --> 00:29:03.190
There's no way he'd be able
to do it already.

421
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.667
He can do it.

422
00:29:04.667 --> 00:29:06.081
Min Ho is smart.

423
00:29:06.081 --> 00:29:09.615
They say birds of a feather
flock together. Idiots.

424
00:29:09.615 --> 00:29:11.400
Ugh, you jerk.

425
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.226
I bet 10,000 won
that Min Ho can do it!

426
00:29:13.226 --> 00:29:14.414
Hey!

427
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.715
Are you punks messing around right now?

428
00:29:17.715 --> 00:29:21.580
Are you not putting your heart and souls
into this because Chef Ohn isn't here?

429
00:29:25.522 --> 00:29:26.817
How many times do I have to tell you

430
00:29:26.817 --> 00:29:28.487
that the heart behind the food
constitutes 50 percent of its taste?

431
00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:33.946
Huh?
How do I use this?

432
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.178
Aw, yes!
I did it!

433
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.642
Do... do this properly, got it?

434
00:29:42.642 --> 00:29:43.958
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

435
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.947
This is our Ms. Im Soo Jung,
our sommelier.

436
00:29:48.947 --> 00:29:50.298
I scouted her.

437
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.562
I think there's a great synergy
between your dishes, Chef

438
00:29:57.562 --> 00:29:59.236
based on the reviews
on your restaurant.

439
00:29:59.236 --> 00:30:01.619
But to me, the dishes all
felt so fresh and new.

440
00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:02.930
Thank you.

441
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.462
My dishes aim to showcase
the real flavor of the ingredients

442
00:30:05.462 --> 00:30:07.861
so my food doesn't try to
stimulate the taste buds too much.

443
00:30:07.861 --> 00:30:09.562
Therefore, the taste of the
food can seem a bit unfamiliar.

444
00:30:09.562 --> 00:30:11.695
But when I go home, I find
myself thinking about it.

445
00:30:11.695 --> 00:30:15.031
Please be sure to have lunch here
before you leave, Ms. Reporter.

446
00:30:16.008 --> 00:30:17.354
I'd love to.

447
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.590
You're doing so well!

448
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:30.725
Did you think that we wouldn't be able
to manage without you, Chef?

449
00:30:30.725 --> 00:30:32.987
Here we are, all done!

450
00:30:36.986 --> 00:30:38.630
What temperature
did you blend this at?

451
00:30:43.891 --> 00:30:45.762
Do we have any leftovers of the
puree that Sous Chef Won Joon made?

452
00:30:45.762 --> 00:30:47.108
Ah, yes. I do.

453
00:30:48.244 --> 00:30:51.542
If you blend this at a high temperature,
the bottom part will get burned and stick

454
00:30:51.542 --> 00:30:53.994
and if you keep blending it,
it turns out like this.

455
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.659
It's completely different than the
one that Chef Won Joon made, right?

456
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:59.351
Yes.

457
00:30:59.351 --> 00:31:00.629
If you don't know how to do it,
then just ask.

458
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:03.908
It's good to ask questions.
It shows that you're interested.

459
00:31:03.908 --> 00:31:05.256
Yes, sir.

460
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:09.265
The kitchen is a place where all of us
work together happily.

461
00:31:09.265 --> 00:31:12.071
Everyone must be respected.
Respect!

462
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:13.699
- Respect!
- Respect!

463
00:31:13.699 --> 00:31:15.909
All right, let's get started now!

464
00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:21.108
