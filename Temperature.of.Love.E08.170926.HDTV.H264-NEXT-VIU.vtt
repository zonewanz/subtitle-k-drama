(Episode 8)

4
00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:16.165
I just got here. I'm coming up.

5
00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:18.364
Director,

6
00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:20.965
you can't wrap up like this.

7
00:00:22.204 --> 00:00:23.834
Do you think I want to do this?

8
00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:26.645
Shin Ha Rim left saying he can't shoot in these conditions.

9
00:00:26.974 --> 00:00:28.005
I'll bring him back.

10
00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:31.114
How can a writer come to a shoot and make a mess like this?

11
00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:34.184
Then you shouldn't change her script.

12
00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:36.015
Goodness.

13
00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:39.384
Are you taking her side?

14
00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:42.485
Just let her know if you're going to change it.

15
00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:44.655
It's like this every time. This isn't a spy movie.

16
00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:45.695
Who are you?

17
00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:47.765
Are you sure you're from the production company?

18
00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:50.595
Do you want this drama to happen or not?

19
00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:52.335
Keep your manners.

20
00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:54.464
I see. I was wondering...

21
00:00:55.134 --> 00:00:56.975
who had that new writer's back.

22
00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:58.634
She must have acted up because of you.

23
00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:00.805
- Come on. - I don't care!

24
00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:02.744
I won't shoot either.

25
00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:05.415
Hurry and wrap up.

26
00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:17.195
Well, you look peaceful.

27
00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:21.695
Yes. I'm just preparing ingredients for tomorrow.

28
00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:23.865
The shoot was canceled.

29
00:01:24.964 --> 00:01:26.434
Do you know how much I lost?

30
00:01:27.835 --> 00:01:29.535
It costs 10,000 dollars just for staff,

31
00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:32.205
and an additional 1,000 dollars for each martial artist.

32
00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:36.615
- The location cost me 3,000... - You talk about money a lot.

33
00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:38.975
- Are you running low? - Are you feeling guilty?

34
00:01:39.615 --> 00:01:40.915
Since Good Soup continues to lose money.

35
00:01:41.484 --> 00:01:43.755
You anticipated that the first year would be an investment.

36
00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:45.415
Leave Good Soup to me.

37
00:01:45.615 --> 00:01:48.154
I won't let you see any loss, even if it's a loss to me.

38
00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:49.525
I'm moved.

39
00:01:50.794 --> 00:01:52.725
Is that why you agreed to film today?

40
00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:55.094
You can be snobby.

41
00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:00.604
I guess drama production isn't easy.

42
00:02:01.104 --> 00:02:03.035
Why won't the director shoot what the writer wrote?

43
00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:06.404
He's a star director.

44
00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:08.374
He only works with new writers.

45
00:02:09.444 --> 00:02:11.344
So he can change everything to the way he wants.

46
00:02:11.575 --> 00:02:13.985
Unfortunately, this time he was partnered with the unexpected.

47
00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:17.784
I like Lee Hyun Soo's writing. "The Man Who Eats Rare Steak".

48
00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:19.154
You've seen it?

49
00:02:19.154 --> 00:02:22.124
Yes. I saw it in France. Hong Ah told me about it.

50
00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.624
Right, you're close with Hong Ah.

51
00:02:25.224 --> 00:02:26.525
Then you must know Hyun Soo too.

52
00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:28.325
I do.

53
00:02:28.724 --> 00:02:30.034
I also know that she has a boyfriend.

54
00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.664
Who said she has a boyfriend?

55
00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:39.374
(Four years ago in 2013, Paris)

56
00:02:46.914 --> 00:02:49.244
This is it. Espresso is the best.

57
00:02:49.244 --> 00:02:51.855
You're so embarrassing to be around.

58
00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:53.325
Don't act like it's your first time in Paris.

59
00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:56.325
It's my first time here with you and Jung Sun.

60
00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:59.395
I can't meet tomorrow. I have to go to the restaurant after school.

61
00:02:59.494 --> 00:03:00.494
I'll go to the restaurant.

62
00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:02.224
Where are you going?

63
00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:04.795
It's too stuffy in here.

64
00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:06.865
I'm going to walk around and find some peace.

65
00:03:06.865 --> 00:03:08.464
You're at it again, aren't you?

66
00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:11.105
Are you thinking about becoming a chef instead of a doctor?

67
00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:14.175
Save me a spot. I might run to you after I finish studying.

68
00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:21.714
You changed a lot in a year.

69
00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:24.015
Is it because you live in a different place?

70
00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:25.555
What do you do these days?

71
00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:28.885
I'm still entering contests, even though I don't get chosen.

72
00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:31.525
Hyun Soo made it, though.

73
00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:34.224
Did she?

74
00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:37.635
That's good.

75
00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:40.865
You look so happy.

76
00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:43.775
I helped her too.

77
00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:45.904
I helped her change the title.

78
00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:47.805
Isn't it "The Man Who Eats Rare Steak"?

79
00:03:48.045 --> 00:03:49.175
How did you know?

80
00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:51.814
She asked me about the title back then.

81
00:03:52.244 --> 00:03:54.085
What did you help with?

82
00:03:55.844 --> 00:03:57.455
When was that?

83
00:03:57.814 --> 00:03:59.184
Why must you know that?

84
00:03:59.925 --> 00:04:01.985
Did you really like her?

85
00:04:02.724 --> 00:04:03.754
No.

86
00:04:05.224 --> 00:04:06.994
I loved her, although she rejected me.

87
00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:15.434
Of course she'd reject you.

88
00:04:16.164 --> 00:04:17.935
It doesn't make sense for you two to be together.

89
00:04:18.835 --> 00:04:21.844
She's dating a guy that's a big shot right now.

90
00:04:22.775 --> 00:04:25.044
He's older than her,

91
00:04:25.044 --> 00:04:28.015
richer, and handsome. He only cares about her.

92
00:04:28.614 --> 00:04:31.054
He's the perfect guy any woman would want.

93
00:04:36.424 --> 00:04:37.724
Should we circle around one more time?

94
00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:40.794
Let's go back to the studio. I have to work.

95
00:04:42.294 --> 00:04:43.695
It's already up.

96
00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:46.034
I told you someone would post it.

97
00:04:46.034 --> 00:04:47.135
Hey!

98
00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:49.734
We'd get 10 percent even if we shoot it the way it is!

99
00:04:49.734 --> 00:04:52.775
- Gosh. - You're impossible to talk to.

100
00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:56.945
That's crazy.

101
00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:00.614
Focus on driving.

102
00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:04.455
I told you not to do it, Hyun Soo.

103
00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:06.885
How can she keep working in that situation?

104
00:05:07.284 --> 00:05:08.924
Did she become a writer for this reason?

105
00:05:08.924 --> 00:05:11.854
Just drive, okay? Don't encourage her.

106
00:05:11.854 --> 00:05:13.565
I didn't encourage her.

107
00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:15.325
I just support her view.

108
00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:18.534
Hey, who scouted the chef that was on set today?

109
00:05:18.664 --> 00:05:20.205
Is that important to you right now?

110
00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:22.765
Who was the chef?

111
00:05:24.404 --> 00:05:25.505
Jung Sun.

112
00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:28.645
Who is Jung Sun?

113
00:05:29.505 --> 00:05:30.714
I guess you didn't know.

114
00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:35.185
You would have told me if you knew.

115
00:05:37.154 --> 00:05:39.414
This is so embarrassing.

116
00:05:40.854 --> 00:05:42.885
Why do hardships come at the same time?

117

118
00:06:12.554 --> 00:06:13.784
- What is that? - What?

119
00:06:14.885 --> 00:06:16.025
My gosh.

120
00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:17.495
Why are you here? It's your day off.

121
00:06:17.695 --> 00:06:19.395
What's the point of staying home? I was bored.

122
00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:21.065
What are you doing?

123
00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:22.765
I'm going to grind some herbs that I dried.

124
00:06:23.935 --> 00:06:26.435
You're so extra. You could use a drier.

125
00:06:26.435 --> 00:06:28.505
It's all about devotion.

126
00:06:28.505 --> 00:06:31.234
The process makes the final product.

127
00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:34.104
Are you making a foam sauce with cilantro?

128
00:06:34.104 --> 00:06:36.145
I'm going to put cilantro in my menu one day.

129
00:06:36.275 --> 00:06:38.844
Sous-chef, are you making a menu already?

130
00:06:38.844 --> 00:06:41.515
Yes, Chef. I'm impatient.

131
00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:45.284
Did you contact Hyun Soo?

132
00:06:45.984 --> 00:06:48.625
She'll be surprised to find out that you're in her drama.

133
00:06:48.885 --> 00:06:49.924
I met her today.

134
00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:52.195
You did? What did she say?

135
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.065
- She ran away. - She did? Why?

136
00:06:55.594 --> 00:06:56.594
I don't know.

137
00:06:57.734 --> 00:07:00.304
Am I a horrible memory to her?

138
00:07:00.404 --> 00:07:02.734
I thought about it so many times,

139
00:07:02.904 --> 00:07:04.104
but I haven't done anything wrong.

140
00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:05.404
Ask her in person.

141
00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:07.931
You're in the same agency,

142
00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:09.604
so ask Mr. Park to set it up.

143
00:07:09.604 --> 00:07:11.515
If I want to see her, I'll ask her myself.

144
00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:13.284
I refuse to get someone else involved.

145
00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:15.445
Do you want her number?

146
00:07:18.154 --> 00:07:19.255
Give me your phone number.

147
00:07:19.654 --> 00:07:21.724
I'll call you, so don't be on your guard.

148
00:07:22.424 --> 00:07:23.654
I'm not on my guard anymore.

149
00:07:25.455 --> 00:07:26.664
But I don't have a pen.

150
00:07:27.794 --> 00:07:29.995
No, that would be low.

151
00:07:30.594 --> 00:07:32.265
I don't want to force it.

(On Jung Sun, chef of Good Soup)

159

Do you know Good Soup?

160
00:08:07.164 --> 00:08:10.005
That's where Mr. Park wanted to eat last time.

(Park Jung Woo)

162
00:08:17.844 --> 00:08:18.875
Yes, Mr. Park.

163
00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:20.815
How does it feel to have made a mess?

164
00:08:22.044 --> 00:08:23.085
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:23.455 --> 00:08:25.015
I met with the chief producer,

166
00:08:25.015 --> 00:08:26.654
and I tried to stop the articles,

167
00:08:26.654 --> 00:08:29.385
but due to social media, it won't be easy to stop it from spreading.

168
00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:30.854
Brace yourself.

169
00:08:43.204 --> 00:08:44.735
You're looking good.

170
00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:47.845
Jerk.

171
00:09:05.694 --> 00:09:07.465
Wash the kelp first.

172
00:09:09.794 --> 00:09:11.064
Is he kidding?

173
00:09:11.064 --> 00:09:12.635
I'll do it for you. He's busy now.

174
00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:15.334
Stop helping him.

175
00:09:15.334 --> 00:09:17.735
He thinks he's a big shot and doesn't listen to me.

176
00:09:17.775 --> 00:09:19.534
He just started a week ago.

177
00:09:19.534 --> 00:09:20.975
If you keep that up, he's going to quit.

178
00:09:21.105 --> 00:09:23.074
If he's going to quit, the sooner the better.

179
00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:26.414
You're so annoying.

180
00:09:26.414 --> 00:09:28.684
Min Ho, you're awesome.

181
00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:31.954
He and I are on the same page.

182
00:09:31.954 --> 00:09:34.084
I didn't say it to make you happy.

183
00:09:34.284 --> 00:09:35.755
He's so cute.

184
00:09:36.154 --> 00:09:37.154
"Make you happy."

185
00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:41.465
Guys, I'm a man. How can I be cute?

186
00:09:41.625 --> 00:09:42.765
Stop that.

187
00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:45.034
If he doesn't like it, stop it no matter how cute he is.

188
00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:47.404
You're really cute, though.

189
00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:49.334
Chef.

190
00:09:52.834 --> 00:09:54.475
We have a table of five reserved for lunch.

191
00:09:54.475 --> 00:09:57.645
Let's not get tied up with numbers and keep to our principles.

192
00:09:57.914 --> 00:09:59.275
Cleanliness, devotion, and focus!

193
00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:00.985
- Focus. - Focus!

194
00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:03.184
Help Kyung Soo prepare the vegetables.

195
00:10:03.284 --> 00:10:04.485
I'll do it all, Chef.

196
00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:06.054
He can't do it.

197
00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:08.025
What did he learn in the States?

198
00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:09.924
Why are you bringing that up?

199
00:10:10.324 --> 00:10:12.824
This is why I hate working with people with inferiority complexes.

200
00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:22.265
That won't do. Sous-chef, can you do it?

201
00:10:22.265 --> 00:10:24.505
- Yes. - Ha Sung, hand him the knife.

202
00:10:24.735 --> 00:10:27.645
The kitchen isn't for training. It's a workplace for professionals.

203
00:10:32.314 --> 00:10:33.944
Your mother is here, Chef.

204
00:10:49.564 --> 00:10:52.235
Isn't it so pretty? It's globe amaranth.

205
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:54.404
Its meaning fits perfectly.

206
00:10:54.534 --> 00:10:56.804
Captivating and unchanging love.

207
00:10:57.475 --> 00:10:58.534
What brings you here?

208
00:10:59.574 --> 00:11:02.404
Can't you be nicer to your mom? It's been a while.

209
00:11:03.944 --> 00:11:05.245
Can I get some herbal tea?

210
00:11:05.475 --> 00:11:07.885
I was about to bring it. Peppermint, right?

211
00:11:11.015 --> 00:11:12.255
She's good.

212
00:11:15.525 --> 00:11:16.554
Did you come alone?

213
00:11:17.025 --> 00:11:18.025
No.

214
00:11:18.025 --> 00:11:21.294
Daniel is holding an exhibit at the Seowon Gallery in October.

215
00:11:21.424 --> 00:11:23.635
He dropped me off here and went to meet the curator.

216
00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:26.365
- Is he coming here? - Of course.

217
00:11:26.735 --> 00:11:28.265
Can you book us a table for four?

218
00:11:28.865 --> 00:11:30.975
Daniel will bring two more people.

219
00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:34.745
All the people he knows are classy.

220
00:11:34.745 --> 00:11:36.674
Enough about Daniel.

221
00:11:37.044 --> 00:11:38.914
Since you're living with him, I hope you guys last.

222
00:11:40.084 --> 00:11:41.784
Thank you for your blessings.

223
00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:44.954
I'm busy, so don't call me.

224
00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:48.654
When Daniel's here, come out and say hello at least.

225
00:11:48.985 --> 00:11:50.625
You're my only family.

226
00:11:51.054 --> 00:11:53.794
I don't want him to look down on me.

227
00:11:56.095 --> 00:11:57.895
Can you become a sponsor...

228
00:11:59.164 --> 00:12:00.765
for Daniel's exhibition?

229
00:12:01.064 --> 00:12:03.775
Enough is enough. You look pathetic.

230
00:12:13.584 --> 00:12:16.485
Hyun Soo, I bought some sandwiches.

231
00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:18.414
Okay.

232
00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:23.554
Come out...

233
00:12:28.595 --> 00:12:31.495
Once the drama's finished, I'll be bald.

234
00:12:33.204 --> 00:12:35.105
Give it to me. I'll throw it out.

235
00:12:35.105 --> 00:12:36.434
It's okay, I'll do it.

236
00:12:41.245 --> 00:12:43.215
("Unruly Detectives")

237
00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:46.944
No wonder the story is all over the place.

238
00:12:46.944 --> 00:12:49.584
Why is a writer creating a scene on set instead of writing?

239
00:12:50.584 --> 00:12:52.215
(You liked this comment.)

240
00:12:55.084 --> 00:12:56.694
Cheer up.

241
00:12:56.794 --> 00:12:58.454
My goodness.

242
00:12:59.255 --> 00:13:01.025
Stop shooting a movie,

243
00:13:01.025 --> 00:13:02.564
and come back to reality.

244
00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:07.034
Your article is trending right now.

245
00:13:07.235 --> 00:13:09.465
I told you not to show it to her.

246
00:13:09.605 --> 00:13:11.635
She can see it after she eats.

247
00:13:11.635 --> 00:13:13.145
What's wrong with you?

248
00:13:13.404 --> 00:13:14.904
It's better to get the bad news first.

249
00:13:14.904 --> 00:13:16.544
Don't treat her like a child.

250
00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:18.475
Do you think she's in the right state of mind?

251
00:13:18.475 --> 00:13:20.584
She's so stressed.

252
00:13:20.584 --> 00:13:23.814
Enough. Why are you guys always fighting?

253
00:13:24.015 --> 00:13:26.414
It feels like she's competing with me to be loyal.

254
00:13:26.755 --> 00:13:28.355
Why are you an assistant writer?

255
00:13:28.454 --> 00:13:30.194
Your family is rich. Quit work and just go home.

256
00:13:30.525 --> 00:13:33.265
I can work, write, or play. Why do you care?

257
00:13:33.265 --> 00:13:35.424
Of course I care. I don't want to be compared with you.

258
00:13:35.424 --> 00:13:37.135
Why would you be compared with me?

259
00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:39.135
All we have in common is our age.

260
00:13:39.135 --> 00:13:41.505
Hey, what are you saying?

261
00:13:41.605 --> 00:13:44.275
Do you mean I'm not comparable to you?

262
00:13:44.475 --> 00:13:49.245
"The writer of "Unruly Detectives", an SBC drama, showed up on set,"

263
00:13:49.845 --> 00:13:52.645
"which caused the shooting to halt."

264
00:13:56.345 --> 00:13:58.255
It's going to get crazy.

265
00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:01.255
- Hello. - Hello.

266
00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:03.755
Hello.

267
00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:06.194
- Hello. - Hello?.

268
00:14:07.095 --> 00:14:08.265
Did you get some sleep?

269
00:14:08.865 --> 00:14:10.235
I was reading an article.

270
00:14:11.235 --> 00:14:13.265
Did I interrupt your breakfast?

271
00:14:13.804 --> 00:14:15.034
Do you want some?

272
00:14:15.304 --> 00:14:16.875
No, I'm okay.

273
00:14:27.184 --> 00:14:30.284
Did you talk to Yi Bok after yesterday's incident?

274
00:14:31.684 --> 00:14:34.554
- No. - Gosh, that fool.

275
00:14:35.225 --> 00:14:36.924
You two should talk.

276
00:14:36.924 --> 00:14:38.794
Do you think I haven't tried that already?

277
00:14:42.725 --> 00:14:44.164
These are the previous scripts.

278
00:14:45.595 --> 00:14:49.404
It's not perfect, but I edited them as much as I could.

279
00:14:49.534 --> 00:14:52.674
You're the one that liked it and wanted to produce it.

280
00:14:52.674 --> 00:14:55.044
I like it. It's a great story.

281
00:14:55.475 --> 00:14:58.215
However, I'm not the one making it. It's Yi Bok that's directing.

282
00:14:58.275 --> 00:15:00.015
You should have persuaded him.

283
00:15:00.684 --> 00:15:03.454
Director Min should have never agreed to do my drama.

284
00:15:05.184 --> 00:15:06.584
The theme completely changed.

285
00:15:07.885 --> 00:15:09.525
I lost my way.

286
00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:11.154
The writer lost her way.

287
00:15:11.924 --> 00:15:13.495
This is the problem with new writers.

288
00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:15.395
They have no sense of flexibility.

289
00:15:15.495 --> 00:15:18.395
Also, they think their writing is the best there is.

290
00:15:18.534 --> 00:15:20.105
They tell me it's not what they wrote.

291
00:15:20.235 --> 00:15:22.505
Who cares if they wrote it or not?

292
00:15:22.704 --> 00:15:25.074
What matters is if the drama is good in the end.

293
00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:28.745
Hyun Soo isn't flexible.

294
00:15:29.145 --> 00:15:31.574
Hey, Ms. Park.

295
00:15:32.444 --> 00:15:34.444
Won't you help me this time?

296
00:15:34.444 --> 00:15:37.215
Gosh. But I...

297
00:15:37.584 --> 00:15:41.355
can't steal a project from someone who used to be my assistant.

298
00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:44.495
Soo Young worked under me for five years.

299
00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:46.525
She didn't win contests, but she's a great writer.

300
00:15:46.525 --> 00:15:48.525
It's a headache to work with new writers.

301
00:15:48.525 --> 00:15:49.995
I'll give her guidance.

302
00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:52.735
If Soo Young is on it, of course I'll give advice.

303
00:15:52.735 --> 00:15:54.834
Thank you, Ms. Park.

304
00:15:54.965 --> 00:15:56.904
You said you have all the scripts?

305
00:15:57.005 --> 00:15:58.005
Yes.

306
00:15:58.005 --> 00:16:00.875
Why would she write all of them already?

307
00:16:01.105 --> 00:16:03.414
Drama is a living thing.

308
00:16:03.414 --> 00:16:05.345
So many things can change in the process.

309
00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:06.485
Exactly.

310
00:16:06.615 --> 00:16:08.284
Send all of the scripts to Soo Young.

311
00:16:08.284 --> 00:16:10.355
We'll take a look...

312
00:16:10.355 --> 00:16:12.084
and fix it the way you want.

313
00:16:14.184 --> 00:16:16.694
Bravo. You're a professional.

314
00:16:17.824 --> 00:16:21.194
I'll make sure to work with a writer with a name value next time.

315
00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:23.794
A writer with a name value wouldn't work with you.

316
00:16:24.694 --> 00:16:25.765
What?

317
00:16:25.895 --> 00:16:27.465
I'm just saying.

318
00:16:28.034 --> 00:16:29.975
Soo Young, let's have some coffee.

319
00:16:53.765 --> 00:16:56.025
Be careful with the delivery. It's for table five.

320
00:16:56.095 --> 00:16:57.135
Okay.

321
00:17:00.564 --> 00:17:01.765
Enjoy.

322
00:17:05.005 --> 00:17:06.435
Ask Chef On to come out.

323
00:17:06.544 --> 00:17:07.544
Okay.

324
00:17:08.675 --> 00:17:10.074
He should say hello.

325
00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:11.644
Why bother?

326
00:17:12.015 --> 00:17:13.814
I know he doesn't like me.

327
00:17:13.814 --> 00:17:16.144
That's not true, Daniel.

328
00:17:16.584 --> 00:17:21.384
My son thinks that my happiness is his happiness.

329
00:17:21.584 --> 00:17:22.755
Don't call him your son.

330
00:17:22.985 --> 00:17:24.655
It makes you sound old.

331
00:17:26.195 --> 00:17:29.394
No matter how old your child is, he's still a baby to his mom.

332
00:17:29.894 --> 00:17:31.834
You wouldn't understand since you don't have a child.

333
00:17:32.195 --> 00:17:35.465
The best thing I've done in my life is not having any kids.

334
00:17:35.604 --> 00:17:38.435
Exactly. It's hard not having kids...

335
00:17:38.435 --> 00:17:41.574
when you were married twice. It's not like you have a problem.

336
00:17:42.544 --> 00:17:45.515
Do you think I couldn't have kids because I have a problem?

337
00:17:46.275 --> 00:17:47.985
Should I go make one right now?

338
00:17:48.084 --> 00:17:49.584
No.

339
00:17:50.755 --> 00:17:53.255
I know very well you don't have a problem.

340
00:17:53.455 --> 00:17:55.185
I'm saying you're amazing.

341
00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:58.354
You must have a strong will to not have any children...

342
00:17:58.354 --> 00:17:59.725
when you were married twice.

343
00:18:00.064 --> 00:18:03.094
You're a man of your word.

344
00:18:03.195 --> 00:18:06.665
You're amazing. That's what I want to say.

345
00:18:07.104 --> 00:18:09.304
Do you know why I live with you?

346
00:18:09.705 --> 00:18:12.334
Because you know my true value.

347
00:18:12.475 --> 00:18:15.874
A man can give his all to the woman that acknowledges him.

348
00:18:18.544 --> 00:18:21.814
You're younger than I am,

349
00:18:22.245 --> 00:18:24.054
but you got married more than me.

350
00:18:25.155 --> 00:18:27.084
I have a lot to learn from you.

351
00:18:35.225 --> 00:18:36.225
Chef On.

352
00:18:37.094 --> 00:18:38.394
How was the food?

353
00:18:38.564 --> 00:18:39.665
It was good.

354
00:18:40.205 --> 00:18:41.905
Please enjoy your time.

355
00:18:44.334 --> 00:18:45.374
Hey...

356
00:18:49.675 --> 00:18:51.114
Did you tell him about my exhibition?

357
00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:53.415
- Of course. - Then why didn't he say anything?

358
00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:55.384
He's a quiet person, like me.

359
00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:57.054
You're not quiet.

360
00:18:58.784 --> 00:19:01.685
He and I talked. He talked about sponsoring,

361
00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:03.725
but I told him not to do it.

362
00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:05.624
Because you might feel uncomfortable.

363
00:19:07.965 --> 00:19:10.495
It is uncomfortable, but I should accept his kindness.

364
00:19:10.495 --> 00:19:11.695
He's your son.

365
00:19:20.344 --> 00:19:22.304
Get on. We'll go to the station together.

366
00:19:22.304 --> 00:19:24.314
I still have about an hour.

367
00:19:24.314 --> 00:19:26.445
Then let's get some tea and talk.

368
00:19:28.185 --> 00:19:29.544
You're like a parent,

369
00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:32.415
and I'm the student being called to the principal's office.

370
00:19:32.515 --> 00:19:34.225
I told you, I'll resolve it.

371
00:19:34.225 --> 00:19:36.284
It's something I have to do.

372
00:19:36.594 --> 00:19:39.324
The director and the writer will always have disagreements.

373
00:19:39.995 --> 00:19:41.995
It's my job to find an agreement.

374
00:19:42.025 --> 00:19:44.965
Is it wrong of me to want to help you find that agreement?

375
00:19:44.965 --> 00:19:46.534
I didn't say you were wrong.

376
00:19:47.064 --> 00:19:49.005
You'll only make me lazy.

377
00:19:50.134 --> 00:19:53.074
You've grown. You won't let me win, will you?

378
00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:54.874
Of course I've grown. It's been years.

379
00:19:55.144 --> 00:19:57.344
You're still unpredictable.

380
00:19:58.215 --> 00:19:59.415
I'm going back in.

381
00:20:00.415 --> 00:20:02.314
I'm going to watch the episode again.

382
00:20:02.844 --> 00:20:05.884
I'm going to objectively look at what happens...

383
00:20:06.685 --> 00:20:10.025
when the actor, director, and writer cannot communicate.

384
00:20:14.864 --> 00:20:17.594
You jerk! How can you do this to me?

385
00:20:18.435 --> 00:20:20.134
You must be punished if you committed a crime.

386
00:20:20.604 --> 00:20:22.104
I'm a prosecutor.

387
00:20:22.104 --> 00:20:24.275
I won't forgive you just because you're my brother.

388
00:20:25.505 --> 00:20:27.144
You still don't trust me?

389
00:20:29.975 --> 00:20:32.745
- Slow down, we'll get hurt. - Are you afraid of getting hurt?

390
00:20:33.215 --> 00:20:34.644
I'll kill you instead.

391
00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.114
He changed the lines again.

392
00:20:38.415 --> 00:20:40.854
He thinks my lines are too feminine.

393
00:20:41.784 --> 00:20:43.155
What's too feminine?

394
00:20:43.624 --> 00:20:45.394
It's so pretentious.

395
00:20:45.624 --> 00:20:48.025
At least the acting is good.

396
00:20:48.824 --> 00:20:52.094
Are you protecting it since it's your baby?

397
00:20:56.675 --> 00:20:58.175
(Shin Ha Rim)

398
00:21:00.344 --> 00:21:01.405
Hello?

399
00:21:02.574 --> 00:21:03.644
Ms. Lee?

400
00:21:04.374 --> 00:21:05.374
Yes.

401
00:21:06.074 --> 00:21:08.245
I read the seventh episode.

402
00:21:09.114 --> 00:21:11.415
Do you remember the part where Joon Ki gets hurt...

403
00:21:11.715 --> 00:21:14.284
and whines saying he feels like he's dying?

404
00:21:15.124 --> 00:21:17.394
He's not whining, he's actually hurt.

405
00:21:17.394 --> 00:21:19.425
How can a man make a fuss about a little injury?

406
00:21:20.265 --> 00:21:23.435
There are a lot of men who feel pain from a small splinter.

407
00:21:24.665 --> 00:21:25.735
Ms. Lee,

408
00:21:26.364 --> 00:21:27.505
don't be like this.

409
00:21:28.205 --> 00:21:30.435
I've been acting for 20 years.

410
00:21:30.435 --> 00:21:32.675
I worked a lot longer than you.

411
00:21:33.374 --> 00:21:35.275
Listen to me, okay?

412
00:21:38.775 --> 00:21:39.775
My gosh.

413
00:21:40.515 --> 00:21:43.354
Seeing you makes me think that debuting isn't all that great.

414
00:21:43.715 --> 00:21:46.015
There are so many annoying people around you.

415
00:21:48.485 --> 00:21:49.685
Play the next one.

416
00:21:51.655 --> 00:21:52.794
That's enough.

417
00:21:52.794 --> 00:21:54.594
Move it. Are you kidding me?

418
00:21:54.594 --> 00:21:56.064
Let sleeping dog lie.

419
00:21:56.064 --> 00:21:57.864
You're not sleeping right now.

420
00:21:57.965 --> 00:21:59.834
Why are you two always bickering?

421
00:21:59.935 --> 00:22:02.465
What did you say? Watch your manners.

422
00:22:03.534 --> 00:22:05.634
I'm growing a lot of patience.

423
00:22:05.634 --> 00:22:08.804
We should have met a long time ago on the streets or something.

424
00:22:13.044 --> 00:22:14.544
You must be punished if you committed a crime.

425
00:22:14.544 --> 00:22:16.455
- He's so cute. - I'm a prosecutor.

426
00:22:16.814 --> 00:22:18.485
Is "Unruly Detectives" good?

427
00:22:18.485 --> 00:22:20.584
Yes. I watch it for Ha Rim.

428
00:22:20.584 --> 00:22:22.155
You still don't trust me?

429
00:22:22.824 --> 00:22:24.425
"You still don't trust me?"

430
00:22:26.124 --> 00:22:27.225
What was that?

431
00:22:27.925 --> 00:22:29.864
The writer is my friend.

432
00:22:29.864 --> 00:22:31.364
Really?

433
00:22:31.364 --> 00:22:33.094
You should give her a call and cheer her up.

434
00:22:33.094 --> 00:22:34.665
A lot of people are bashing her on the Internet.

435
00:22:38.304 --> 00:22:41.104
Lee Hyun Soo,

436
00:22:41.675 --> 00:22:43.374
I support you.

437
00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:45.044
(Register)

438
00:22:45.044 --> 00:22:46.544
("Unruly Detectives")

439
00:22:48.445 --> 00:22:50.515
Lee Hyun Soo, I support you.

440
00:22:55.824 --> 00:22:56.955
("Unruly Detectives")

441
00:23:07.064 --> 00:23:08.735
Take off your sunglasses.

442
00:23:12.005 --> 00:23:14.675
Tell me what you have to. I have to go shoot.

443
00:23:14.804 --> 00:23:17.415
I work even if the writer makes a scene. Why?

444
00:23:17.844 --> 00:23:20.084
Because I love our viewers and I feel responsible.

445
00:23:20.084 --> 00:23:23.084
We all love our viewers and feel responsible too.

446
00:23:23.614 --> 00:23:25.415
Ms. Lee, what do you want to do?

447
00:23:26.884 --> 00:23:28.685
I'll accept his changes.

448
00:23:29.455 --> 00:23:30.495
However,

449
00:23:30.894 --> 00:23:32.425
tell us what you change.

450
00:23:32.425 --> 00:23:36.265
Ms. Lee, just throw in the towel if you can't handle it.

451
00:23:36.265 --> 00:23:38.594
I worked with a lot of writers,

452
00:23:38.594 --> 00:23:41.765
and the other writers were all able to write for me.

453
00:23:41.765 --> 00:23:43.205
I won't throw in the towel.

454
00:23:44.005 --> 00:23:46.205
Even if I get fired, I would never do such a thing.

455
00:23:46.304 --> 00:23:48.505
No one's getting fired.

456
00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:51.415
I like the way you unravel your stories.

457
00:23:52.374 --> 00:23:55.915
Yi Bok, you need to stop blowing things up. It's costing a fortune.

458
00:23:57.155 --> 00:23:58.215
My goodness.

459
00:23:58.985 --> 00:24:02.725
This is why you're sitting behind a desk instead of directing.

460
00:24:03.794 --> 00:24:05.495
You jerk.

461
00:24:10.394 --> 00:24:11.864
Did the production company take a bribe?

462
00:24:12.564 --> 00:24:15.134
Why else would you protect the writer?

463
00:24:15.134 --> 00:24:17.374
Have you gone blind?

464
00:24:19.574 --> 00:24:20.705
Yes, I have.

465
00:24:26.844 --> 00:24:27.884
Darn it.

466
00:24:43.864 --> 00:24:45.465
I didn't come here as your parent.

467
00:24:49.134 --> 00:24:51.134
You must have a lot of spare time.

468
00:24:52.505 --> 00:24:54.005
I still have to eat even when I'm busy.

469
00:24:56.074 --> 00:24:57.114
You're right.

470
00:25:21.134 --> 00:25:22.905
I asked you so many times to come here,

471
00:25:24.634 --> 00:25:26.844
but you were always too busy.

472
00:25:28.005 --> 00:25:29.245
I won't go in.

473
00:25:30.675 --> 00:25:31.715
Why not?

474
00:25:33.685 --> 00:25:34.685
I'm tired.

475
00:25:35.844 --> 00:25:37.554
No matter how tired you are, you should still eat.

476
00:25:42.854 --> 00:25:44.824
Where are you coming from?

477
00:25:44.995 --> 00:25:47.195
We ran out of something, so I went to go get more.

478
00:25:51.235 --> 00:25:53.304
I'll come in after this call. Go inside first.

479
00:25:54.405 --> 00:25:55.864
Yes, hello.

480
00:25:56.675 --> 00:25:57.905
Who is this?

481
00:26:04.614 --> 00:26:05.775
Why aren't you running away?

482
00:26:06.715 --> 00:26:09.084
- Should I? - You did before.

483
00:26:10.185 --> 00:26:12.515
Did I do something wrong to you?

484
00:26:12.655 --> 00:26:14.084
I never said that you did.

485
00:26:14.084 --> 00:26:15.124
Then why are you avoiding me?

486
00:26:16.054 --> 00:26:17.624
The situation wasn't very good.

487
00:26:17.955 --> 00:26:21.064
Would you have said hello if you were in my position?

488
00:26:21.225 --> 00:26:23.294
Don't talk to me like that. It feels like we're close.

489
00:26:24.864 --> 00:26:26.935
I didn't mean it like that.

490
00:26:26.935 --> 00:26:28.634
Then how did you mean it?

491
00:26:28.735 --> 00:26:30.935
The "you" I used is a pronoun.

492
00:26:31.074 --> 00:26:33.245
I didn't mean it as a pet name...

493
00:26:46.384 --> 00:26:47.455
Congratulations.

494
00:26:48.554 --> 00:26:49.755
You've become a chef.

495
00:26:50.794 --> 00:26:53.265
Congratulations. You've become a writer.

496
00:26:53.864 --> 00:26:55.725
I'm too lousy to accept congratulations.

497
00:26:55.894 --> 00:26:57.534
It's too early for me to accept congratulations too.

498
00:26:58.294 --> 00:27:01.104
It's one hurdle after another.

499
00:27:01.304 --> 00:27:02.634
You sound like an adult now.

500
00:27:02.634 --> 00:27:04.735
That must mean you're getting old.

501
00:27:05.735 --> 00:27:08.144
That really pierced into my heart.

502
00:27:08.144 --> 00:27:11.015
You're still bound by your age, aren't you?

503
00:27:13.515 --> 00:27:16.515
You've grown to become more annoying, haven't you?

504
00:27:16.685 --> 00:27:18.185
Growing is a good thing.

505
00:27:19.284 --> 00:27:20.854
Why are you doing this to me?

506
00:27:21.824 --> 00:27:25.854
You disappeared without saying anything, show up and act cynical?

507
00:27:27.794 --> 00:27:29.594
Did you forget that you didn't pick up my call?

508
00:27:30.495 --> 00:27:31.735
How can I forget?

509
00:27:33.064 --> 00:27:35.765
Do you know how much I regretted it, and how much it hurt?

510
00:27:36.975 --> 00:27:38.735
Why did you regret it, and why were you hurt?

511
00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:49.985
Forget it. It's in the past.

512
00:27:50.715 --> 00:27:52.185
You have a big shot boyfriend,

513
00:27:52.185 --> 00:27:54.854
and your dream of becoming a writer came true.

514
00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:57.525
Why did you regret it, and why were you hurt?

515
00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:04.634
Why are you still outside?

516
00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:13.104
A stranger might think...

517
00:28:15.044 --> 00:28:16.644
that you're having a couple's quarrel.

518
00:28:25.955 --> 00:28:29.124
(Temperature of Love OST Part 2 "Love-ing" by GFriend's Eun Ha)

519
00:28:37.435 --> 00:28:39.834
(Temperature of Love)

520
00:28:40.735 --> 00:28:41.965
Anybody have plans after work?

521
00:28:41.965 --> 00:28:44.175
If you're free, let's go run. It'll be a team workshop.

522
00:28:44.175 --> 00:28:45.604
Are you not close with Hyun Soo anymore?

523
00:28:45.604 --> 00:28:48.705
Hyun Soo doing well bothers me more than the fact that I failed.

524
00:28:48.705 --> 00:28:51.044
Only the evil ones succeed in this industry.

525
00:28:51.044 --> 00:28:53.044
- Do you want to go out with me? - I'm not the one for you.

526
00:28:53.044 --> 00:28:54.515
Is it because of Hyun Soo?

527
00:28:54.515 --> 00:28:57.554
If you want to date Hyun Soo, you must win her trust.

528
00:28:57.715 --> 00:28:59.685
- Good night. - You go first.

529
00:28:59.685 --> 00:29:01.485
I told you she has a boyfriend.

530
00:29:01.485 --> 00:29:02.584
I was prepared.

531
00:29:02.584 --> 00:29:04.124
I have a favor to ask you.

532
00:29:04.255 --> 00:29:05.294
Can we meet?

533
00:29:05.294 --> 00:29:06.594
I'll wait for you at Good Soup.
