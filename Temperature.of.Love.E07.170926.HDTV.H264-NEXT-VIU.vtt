1
00:00:07.617 --> 00:00:09.017
What's wrong with your voice?

2
00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:10.017
(Episode 7)

3
00:00:10.017 --> 00:00:11.017
Did you cry?

4
00:00:11.756 --> 00:00:12.756
No.

5
00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:15.457
Why did you call? It's late.

6
00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:17.656
You won, Hyun Soo.

7
00:00:18.397 --> 00:00:20.527
Something really good happened to me,

8
00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:22.126
and you were picked to celebrate with me.

9
00:00:23.297 --> 00:00:25.466
Did Alain get back to you?

10
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.566
Yes.

11
00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:30.106
Congratulations.

12
00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:31.606
Do you want to meet right now?

13
00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:33.777
No.

14
00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:36.676
I'll come to your place. It'll be quick.

15
00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:38.277
I told you, no.

16
00:00:39.746 --> 00:00:42.887
You're being childish. Don't pester me.

17
00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:44.756
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:46.557
Go to bed, then.

19
00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:08.406
You thought I wouldn't come if you called me childish, didn't you?

20
00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:12.117
Why did you cry?

21
00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:14.216
You knew?

22
00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:16.716
Yes. I've also cried like that before.

23
00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:19.156
They say men are only allowed to cry three times in life.

24
00:01:19.317 --> 00:01:20.986
First, when their parents pass away.

25
00:01:20.986 --> 00:01:22.757
Anyone can cry if they're sad regardless of gender.

26
00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:24.057
Why are you discriminating?

27
00:01:24.057 --> 00:01:25.156
That's such an outdated thought.

28
00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:27.227
I know. I know.

29
00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:31.096
I already know because my dad cries easily.

30
00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:34.807
I just wanted to be cranky.

31
00:01:35.337 --> 00:01:36.376
Why?

32
00:01:37.507 --> 00:01:38.537
I don't know.

33
00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:43.117
Should I tell you what I did when I felt sad?

34
00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:14.776
You need to stretch.

35
00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:16.917
Otherwise you'll suffer from muscle pain.

36
00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:18.776
You nag so much.

37
00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:20.947
But you're listening to me.

38
00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:22.817
I know.

39
00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:43.276
Will you wait for me?

40
00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:48.546
I thought of you...

41
00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:50.676
as soon as I got an email from Alain Passard.

42
00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:52.417
I wondered what I should do.

43
00:02:58.687 --> 00:03:01.356
I'm into this song these days. You want to try listening to it?

44
00:03:03.556 --> 00:03:05.097
Do you know Amy Winehouse?

45
00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:07.266
I do.

46
00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:11.236
She's a British singer-songwriter who died of a drug overdose at 27.

47
00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:12.296
Right.

48
00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:14.437
I think she was a genius.

49
00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:55.276
Will you go out with me?

50
00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:19.237
My scriptwriting teacher said this.

51
00:04:20.036 --> 00:04:21.507
Drama begins...

52
00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:24.677
between a man and a woman when they break up.

53
00:04:40.726 --> 00:04:42.086
You see, the lyrics,

54
00:04:42.927 --> 00:04:44.857
"We only said goodbye with words"...

55
00:04:45.857 --> 00:04:46.927
Do you know what it means?

56
00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:50.437
My English is not that good enough to translate it right away.

57
00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:55.807
"We only said goodbye with words."

58
00:04:59.576 --> 00:05:01.507
How could people say goodbye only with words?

59
00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:08.547
All my previous relationships ended when I wanted them to end.

60
00:05:13.257 --> 00:05:14.887
Love isn't special to me.

61
00:05:17.226 --> 00:05:18.656
My parents...

62
00:05:19.726 --> 00:05:22.797
love each other even after 30 years of marriage.

63
00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:25.596
But there's nothing special about their feelings.

64
00:05:27.007 --> 00:05:28.666
I shouldn't waste...

65
00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:33.047
important time of my youth for petty love.

66
00:05:36.247 --> 00:05:37.617
So love...

67
00:05:38.447 --> 00:05:39.887
is petty for you.

68
00:05:42.117 --> 00:05:44.117
Like you said, I cried today.

69
00:05:47.257 --> 00:05:49.627
My dream has collided with reality again.

70
00:05:52.927 --> 00:05:54.697
It was harder today than usual.

71
00:05:58.137 --> 00:05:59.807
You're difficult to understand.

72
00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:02.507
That's right.

73
00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:08.047
But you aren't easy either.

74
00:06:11.047 --> 00:06:12.776
I'm difficult in another way.

75
00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:20.927
Sorry.

76
00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:26.697
Don't be.

77
00:06:28.226 --> 00:06:29.997
You gave me a clear answer...

78
00:06:31.596 --> 00:06:33.036
to my request to wait for me.

79
00:07:04.567 --> 00:07:06.237
I'll follow you after I park my car.

80
00:07:06.406 --> 00:07:08.536
Thanks. You really don't have to do this.

81
00:07:08.536 --> 00:07:10.276
Then I'll do another favor for you.

82
00:07:10.677 --> 00:07:12.206
Give me your phone. I'll cancel it for you.

83
00:07:15.677 --> 00:07:16.677
Let me make a call first.

84
00:07:20.317 --> 00:07:22.317
(On Jung Sun)

85
00:07:24.456 --> 00:07:26.156
(On Jung Sun)

86
00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:39.266
(On Jung Sun)

87
00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:40.766
Do you want to take it?

88
00:07:42.737 --> 00:07:43.836
I won't pick it up.

89
00:07:50.516 --> 00:07:53.416
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

90
00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:55.617
Please leave a message after the beep.

91
00:08:06.766 --> 00:08:07.766
Visit me on your break.

92
00:08:08.067 --> 00:08:09.096
Okay.

93
00:08:10.396 --> 00:08:12.666
Jung Sun, it's time to go.

94
00:08:13.067 --> 00:08:14.766
I want to look around the duty-free stores.

95
00:08:15.466 --> 00:08:16.836
I won't buy anything.

96
00:08:17.476 --> 00:08:18.507
Okay.

97
00:08:23.416 --> 00:08:26.346
- We'll go now. - Okay, I'll call you later.

98
00:08:43.396 --> 00:08:45.696
(On Jung Sun)

99
00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:52.877
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the beep.

100
00:09:28.007 --> 00:09:32.146
(Temperature of Love)

101
00:09:39.727 --> 00:09:40.827
Hello, sir.

102
00:09:40.827 --> 00:09:42.227
Read through the books over there.

103
00:09:42.857 --> 00:09:44.597
We need to decide whether to buy their publication rights.

104
00:09:45.097 --> 00:09:46.097
Think carefully.

105
00:09:47.026 --> 00:09:48.026
Yes, sir.

106
00:09:50.296 --> 00:09:52.896
Please show Ms. Lee her desk.

107
00:09:53.107 --> 00:09:54.166
Yes, sir.

108
00:09:54.936 --> 00:09:58.507
Also, look through the ones we have the rights to,

109
00:09:58.507 --> 00:09:59.747
and write synopses for them.

110
00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:01.107
Okay.

111
00:10:18.957 --> 00:10:20.196
Do you really think...

112
00:10:21.127 --> 00:10:23.166
I would ask you take all these at once?

113
00:10:24.036 --> 00:10:25.237
Then?

114
00:10:25.237 --> 00:10:27.007
Go to your desk, and I'll ask someone to bring them to you.

115
00:10:27.707 --> 00:10:30.637
I can carry them if you give me a paper bag or something.

116
00:10:33.276 --> 00:10:34.347
I can carry them myself.

117
00:10:36.207 --> 00:10:37.217
All right, then.

118
00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:41.186
Okay.

119
00:10:58.367 --> 00:10:59.436
Hyun Soo!

120
00:11:03.577 --> 00:11:06.406
You didn't have to come. I know you are busy preparing for the contest.

121
00:11:06.406 --> 00:11:09.276
I'm done writing because I changed it to a short one-act drama.

122
00:11:09.276 --> 00:11:11.117
I already submitted it since it's due tomorrow.

123
00:11:11.117 --> 00:11:12.146
Good for you.

124
00:11:13.516 --> 00:11:14.617
Have this.

125
00:11:15.387 --> 00:11:17.457
I bought it for you since you said you have no time to go outside.

126
00:11:18.357 --> 00:11:21.627
Why do they give you so much work that you don't have time to eat?

127
00:11:21.627 --> 00:11:23.656
- Stop. - Why do you stop me from talking?

128
00:11:23.926 --> 00:11:27.066
I have freedom to form a publication protest association.

129
00:11:30.997 --> 00:11:32.396
He's my boss.

130
00:11:33.837 --> 00:11:36.377
She's my friend whom I met while I studied scriptwriting.

131
00:11:38.077 --> 00:11:39.276
Hello.

132
00:11:39.477 --> 00:11:42.607
You're a CEO, yet you're so young and handsome.

133
00:11:42.607 --> 00:11:43.646
Hey.

134
00:11:44.146 --> 00:11:45.146
I'll excuse myself.

135
00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:46.387
Can you treat me to lunch?

136
00:11:46.387 --> 00:11:47.416
My gosh, stop.

137
00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.717
I have a previous engagement.

138
00:11:49.957 --> 00:11:51.257
I'll see you next time if I have the chance.

139
00:11:51.257 --> 00:11:52.357
Okay.

140
00:11:57.757 --> 00:11:59.426
Hey, why did you do that?

141
00:11:59.597 --> 00:12:01.367
I wanted to test what kind of guy he is...

142
00:12:01.367 --> 00:12:02.867
because it seemed like he likes you.

143
00:12:03.536 --> 00:12:05.867
I want you to meet a nice guy.

144
00:12:05.997 --> 00:12:08.906
You're completely off track. He doesn't like me.

145
00:12:08.967 --> 00:12:10.306
You should make him yours.

146
00:12:10.977 --> 00:12:13.377
He's the type who doesn't care about anything else other than his goal.

147
00:12:13.406 --> 00:12:16.776
If not, he would've fell for me when I started flirting with him.

148
00:12:16.776 --> 00:12:18.676
I'm in no place to be interested in men right now.

149
00:12:19.176 --> 00:12:22.686
I'm already struggling with trying make a proper living.

150
00:12:22.987 --> 00:12:25.156
You and I are in different situations.

151
00:12:26.757 --> 00:12:27.926
Thank you for this.

152
00:12:42.467 --> 00:12:44.436
It's more of a preference issue rather than a personality thing.

153
00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:46.806
They must prefer rare meat because it's juicy and tender.

154
00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:48.646
They must also like the taste of raw meat.

The number you have dialed does not exist.

Please check the number and dial it again.

162
00:13:18.607 --> 00:13:19.906
That's weird.

163
00:13:21.546 --> 00:13:23.516
Why doesn't his number exist?

164
00:13:38.757 --> 00:13:40.526

166
00:13:45.967 --> 00:13:47.436
Did he hear me?

167
00:13:48.867 --> 00:13:49.977
Yes, Mr. Park.

168
00:13:49.977 --> 00:13:51.337
Why haven't you gone home yet?

169

I was just about to.

00:13:54.207 --> 00:13:55.377
Bye.

171
00:14:03.786 --> 00:14:05.717
Why is he being so polite all of a sudden?

172
00:14:16.536 --> 00:14:19.337
I'm only doing this because I don't like being indebted to people.

173
00:14:21.566 --> 00:14:23.837
You came over to my place a lot.

174
00:14:26.347 --> 00:14:28.007
So I should come to your place at least once.

175
00:14:40.926 --> 00:14:42.127
Who are you?

176
00:14:45.556 --> 00:14:47.526
Is Jung Sun home?

177
00:14:47.727 --> 00:14:49.388
If you're looking for the previous tenant,

178
00:14:49.413 --> 00:14:51.121
you should ask the landlord.

179
00:15:01.121 --> 00:15:04.353
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E07 Temperature of Love "Love Isn't Special to Me"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

180
00:15:14.727 --> 00:15:17.127
We're moving out tomorrow. Why aren't you packing?

181
00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:22.597
You must be happy that you got a job.

182
00:15:22.597 --> 00:15:24.497
But I wonder how long your contract's going to last.

183
00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:30.176
How can he do this to me?

184
00:15:30.977 --> 00:15:33.446
How can he just disappear like this?

185
00:15:34.007 --> 00:15:35.446
You must be crazy now.

186
00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:38.847
Fine, just go crazy. That's the only way...

187
00:15:38.847 --> 00:15:40.987
- you'll be able to survive. - I thought of you...

188
00:15:40.987 --> 00:15:43.257
as soon as I got an email from Alain Passard.

189
00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:44.916
Will you wait for me?

190
00:15:45.217 --> 00:15:46.357
My gosh!

191
00:15:48.487 --> 00:15:49.997
What's wrong with you?

192
00:15:51.926 --> 00:15:55.127
All my previous relationships ended when I wanted them to end.

193
00:15:56.367 --> 00:15:58.097
Love isn't special to me.

194
00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:00.107
My gosh.

195
00:16:12.016 --> 00:16:17.087
(December, 2012)

196
00:16:23.457 --> 00:16:25.857
A normal story about normal people.

197
00:16:26.296 --> 00:16:28.566
It's very touching since people can relate to their story.

198
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:30.867
It's not a story about falling in love at a company.

199
00:16:30.997 --> 00:16:33.066
It's a realistic drama that portrays the ups and downs...

200
00:16:33.066 --> 00:16:35.967
of office workers who work at a company.

201
00:16:36.377 --> 00:16:38.637
You must buy the publication rights no matter what.

202
00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:54.526
(Analysis on Competitiveness for "Cheese in the Trap")

203
00:16:54.526 --> 00:16:55.656
I'm done reading this.

204
00:16:57.757 --> 00:16:59.127
You wrote it well.

205
00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:02.227
I'm still working on "Misaeng". I'll try to finish it quickly.

206
00:17:02.467 --> 00:17:03.936
You don't need to work on that anymore.

207
00:17:04.097 --> 00:17:05.936
Another company already bought the publication rights for that.

208
00:17:06.607 --> 00:17:07.867
Oh, I see.

209
00:17:08.137 --> 00:17:10.607
Stop working at the company until late.

210
00:17:11.107 --> 00:17:12.307
You'll increase the cost of electric bills.

211
00:17:12.476 --> 00:17:14.246
You're always here until late too.

212
00:17:14.246 --> 00:17:15.676
I'm paying my money for what I use.

213
00:17:17.216 --> 00:17:18.277
Okay, fine.

214
00:17:20.986 --> 00:17:22.117
Do you want to eat?

215
00:17:23.916 --> 00:17:25.057
No.

216
00:17:26.357 --> 00:17:27.357
No, wait.

217
00:17:27.956 --> 00:17:29.456
I'd love to eat.

218
00:17:29.627 --> 00:17:30.797
Okay, let's go then.

219
00:17:31.956 --> 00:17:33.466
I said, I'd love to eat.

220
00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:35.027
And I'm saying we should go eat.

221
00:17:36.127 --> 00:17:37.666
Don't try to play tricks on me.

222
00:17:38.236 --> 00:17:40.736
Did you say that because I like forcing you to do the opposite?

223
00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:43.236
Yes.

224
00:17:45.476 --> 00:17:47.277
Option one. You're simply not hungry.

225
00:17:47.847 --> 00:17:50.277
Option two. You don't want to eat with me.

226
00:17:50.317 --> 00:17:51.377
Which one is it?

227
00:17:52.347 --> 00:17:53.486
The first one.

228
00:17:54.986 --> 00:17:56.246
Clean up, and go home.

229
00:18:01.926 --> 00:18:03.656
I want to eat now.

230
00:18:08.926 --> 00:18:11.267
I can be a bit fickle sometimes.

231
00:18:18.676 --> 00:18:19.877
This looks good.

232
00:18:32.017 --> 00:18:33.527
Thank you for the meal.

233
00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.367
Does it not taste good?

234
00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:44.436
No, it's delicious.

235
00:18:51.176 --> 00:18:53.476
Why do I feel like...

236
00:18:53.906 --> 00:18:55.877
you're not doing this to develop your menu,

237
00:18:56.416 --> 00:18:59.986
but you're making soup for me since I told you I like it?

238
00:19:00.817 --> 00:19:01.887
What's wrong?

239
00:19:02.686 --> 00:19:04.057
Do you tend to make good guesses?

240
00:19:04.887 --> 00:19:05.887
No.

241
00:19:06.986 --> 00:19:08.527
You're wrong again.

242
00:19:14.426 --> 00:19:15.597
Never mind.

243
00:19:16.996 --> 00:19:18.396
I don't think I can eat this.

244
00:19:21.107 --> 00:19:23.837
I change my mind really often. You can keep eating.

245
00:19:38.557 --> 00:19:39.926
Jung Woo, I'm here.

246
00:19:40.057 --> 00:19:41.857
I just finished shooting nearby.

247
00:19:41.857 --> 00:19:43.597
I'm going to sleep here today.

248
00:19:44.956 --> 00:19:47.067
Go get me a can of beer from the refrigerator.

249
00:19:48.127 --> 00:19:51.137
I just came back from doing everything for the director.

250
00:19:51.166 --> 00:19:52.466
Do you really have to do this to me?

251
00:19:54.037 --> 00:19:55.037
Do you not want to?

252
00:19:55.037 --> 00:19:57.637
No, I'd love to.

253
00:19:57.936 --> 00:20:01.406
It's an honor to be able to take orders from you.

254
00:20:02.847 --> 00:20:04.547
Let's see. A can of beer.

255
00:20:12.017 --> 00:20:14.887
How sexy. You're attractive in a very dark way.

256
00:20:15.557 --> 00:20:16.696
You're crazy.

257
00:20:17.456 --> 00:20:19.666
I don't mind hearing you call me crazy.

258
00:20:22.896 --> 00:20:23.996
Is Hyun Soo doing well?

259
00:20:24.196 --> 00:20:25.267
Yes, of course.

260
00:20:26.097 --> 00:20:27.137
She's nice, isn't she?

261
00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:30.236
No.

262
00:20:30.936 --> 00:20:32.037
She's incredible.

263
00:20:32.976 --> 00:20:34.107
What do you mean?

264
00:20:34.746 --> 00:20:35.777
I like her.

265
00:20:37.517 --> 00:20:38.716
Does Hyun Soo know that?

266
00:20:40.817 --> 00:20:43.456
She'll find out soon. I'm going to ask her out.

267
00:20:45.057 --> 00:20:47.486
Jung Woo, if this is just a fling, just forget it.

268
00:20:47.486 --> 00:20:49.726
She's a very serious person. She's not your type.

269
00:20:52.097 --> 00:20:54.297
Do you think I ask women out...

270
00:20:54.627 --> 00:20:56.396
just so I can have flings?

271
00:20:58.567 --> 00:20:59.597
No.

272
00:21:00.807 --> 00:21:04.236
You're a coldhearted businessman, so you're very careful.

273
00:21:04.436 --> 00:21:05.906
I've had my eye on her for a while now.

274
00:21:06.676 --> 00:21:08.107
I'm done observing her.

275
00:21:18.357 --> 00:21:19.357
She's mine.

276
00:21:36.976 --> 00:21:38.436
Hello?

277
00:21:40.206 --> 00:21:42.676
Yes, I'm Lee Hyun Soo.

278
00:21:45.746 --> 00:21:47.117
Did you say SBC?

279
00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:50.716
You have been selected as the winner in the contest.

280
00:21:55.827 --> 00:21:57.726
Is that right?

281
00:21:57.926 --> 00:22:00.926
The award ceremony will be held in October 15.

282
00:22:01.527 --> 00:22:03.637
I'll call you if there are any changes.

283
00:22:04.297 --> 00:22:05.696
Thank you.

284
00:22:15.847 --> 00:22:18.476
Hyun Soo, did you hear?

285
00:22:18.847 --> 00:22:21.547
I heard they called the contest winners today.

286
00:22:23.117 --> 00:22:24.117
I know.

287
00:22:25.956 --> 00:22:27.587
What should we do?

288
00:22:28.226 --> 00:22:30.726
Well, I'm all right, but what should you do?

289
00:22:30.726 --> 00:22:32.156
I still have much time left to try out.

290
00:22:33.466 --> 00:22:35.396
I got a call.

291
00:22:36.027 --> 00:22:37.537
Did you?

292
00:22:38.797 --> 00:22:40.307
So you were selected?

293
00:22:41.436 --> 00:22:42.466
Yes.

294
00:22:44.236 --> 00:22:46.746
Why are you telling me this now? I feel embarrassed.

295
00:22:46.847 --> 00:22:48.547
You should've told me earlier.

296
00:22:48.906 --> 00:22:52.117
I was going to, but I wasn't sure whether you were selected as well.

297
00:22:52.716 --> 00:22:53.916
Congratulations.

298
00:22:54.186 --> 00:22:55.686
You should treat me to a meal.

299
00:22:56.087 --> 00:22:57.087
Where are you?

300
00:22:57.517 --> 00:22:59.287
I'm on my way to see my boss.

301
00:23:00.226 --> 00:23:01.627
You're so popular.

302
00:23:02.486 --> 00:23:03.926
I'm at home now.

303
00:23:04.926 --> 00:23:06.327
Call me when you finish early today.

304
00:23:06.726 --> 00:23:07.797
Okay.

305
00:23:28.347 --> 00:23:31.087
I'm not late. It's you who came here early.

306
00:23:38.196 --> 00:23:39.827
What is it that you want to say...

307
00:23:40.527 --> 00:23:42.166
that you called me in here?

308
00:23:43.196 --> 00:23:45.037
I love skyscrapers.

309
00:23:46.297 --> 00:23:47.337
Pardon?

310
00:23:50.176 --> 00:23:53.547
I like to look down from high places.

311
00:24:02.486 --> 00:24:04.486
My dad was a failed businessman.

312
00:24:05.817 --> 00:24:08.887
He lost my mom first in return for his failure.

313
00:24:09.527 --> 00:24:10.827
And he gained illness.

314
00:24:11.627 --> 00:24:14.797
He was afraid my life would be like his.

315
00:24:15.926 --> 00:24:18.696
He gave me all his fortunes to go to the States.

316
00:24:19.567 --> 00:24:21.736
He thought a great world would make a great person.

317
00:24:23.936 --> 00:24:27.047
I succeeded and earned a lot of money.

318
00:24:27.746 --> 00:24:28.906
But my dad isn't here.

319
00:24:31.176 --> 00:24:32.986
He passed away before he could witness my success.

320
00:24:36.087 --> 00:24:37.617
Like General Yi Sun Sin,

321
00:24:39.087 --> 00:24:42.256
he told others not to let me find out about his death.

322
00:24:44.827 --> 00:24:46.156
I want to make a family.

323
00:24:48.966 --> 00:24:50.597
Family is now a choice for me.

324
00:24:53.506 --> 00:24:54.506
I think...

325
00:24:57.736 --> 00:24:59.377
I'll be able to live happily with you.

326
00:25:11.357 --> 00:25:12.387
What's wrong?

327
00:25:14.027 --> 00:25:15.486
Was my story that sad?

328
00:25:17.456 --> 00:25:19.396
You can empathize with others so well.

329
00:25:24.236 --> 00:25:25.966
I won the contest.

330
00:25:26.867 --> 00:25:28.436
I got a call earlier today.

331
00:25:31.637 --> 00:25:33.446
Congratulations. Good job.

332
00:25:34.746 --> 00:25:35.807
But...

333
00:25:38.577 --> 00:25:39.817
I'm not pleased.

334
00:25:42.146 --> 00:25:44.057
It's what I really wanted.

335
00:25:45.686 --> 00:25:48.327
I've run towards this goal my entire life.

336
00:25:51.057 --> 00:25:52.256
But I'm not happy.

337
00:25:57.736 --> 00:25:59.597
I have a man I love.

338
00:26:04.706 --> 00:26:06.676
But I realized it too late.

339
00:26:11.277 --> 00:26:13.287
I realized what love is...

340
00:26:14.646 --> 00:26:16.916
only after he disappeared from my sight.

341
00:26:20.926 --> 00:26:22.557
He's my life's...

342
00:26:23.357 --> 00:26:24.426
You...

343
00:26:27.597 --> 00:26:29.896
Are you aware what you're doing to me right now?

344
00:26:30.267 --> 00:26:32.037
He asked me to wait for him.

345
00:26:35.107 --> 00:26:36.537
He called me.

346
00:26:38.337 --> 00:26:40.847
But I couldn't take his call because I was with you.

347
00:26:42.246 --> 00:26:44.117
It was his last call.

348
00:26:47.916 --> 00:26:49.317
I should've taken it.

349
00:26:52.216 --> 00:26:53.686
I should've.

350
00:26:59.827 --> 00:27:01.867
Where must I go to see him now?

351
00:28:13.367 --> 00:28:14.506
Am I truly the scriptwriter?

352
00:28:15.067 --> 00:28:16.307
How could you do this?

353
00:28:16.607 --> 00:28:19.777
I ignored your bad reputation out of my greed to debut.

354
00:28:20.107 --> 00:28:22.847
I thought you wouldn't change my script, but I was wrong.

355
00:28:24.646 --> 00:28:26.887
- Anyone? - Look around you.

356
00:28:27.246 --> 00:28:28.317
Look.

357
00:28:28.946 --> 00:28:30.017
Here.

358
00:28:31.956 --> 00:28:33.057
I'm here.

359
00:28:36.527 --> 00:28:39.357
(5 years later, 2017)

360
00:28:39.357 --> 00:28:42.196
Who are you? You aren't our staff.

361
00:28:45.797 --> 00:28:47.006
I'm your staff for today.

362
00:28:51.807 --> 00:28:53.246
I met him again...

363
00:28:54.946 --> 00:28:57.377
when I was making a scene of all times.

364
00:28:58.946 --> 00:29:01.117
There wasn't a moment when I forgot about him.

365
00:29:02.986 --> 00:29:04.087
I...

366
00:29:04.887 --> 00:29:07.557
desperately wanted to see him again even if it was coincidence.

367
00:29:09.896 --> 00:29:10.896
He's...

368
00:29:11.926 --> 00:29:14.597
my first love who disappeared...

369
00:29:16.226 --> 00:29:17.367
in the last bit of my youth.

370
00:29:21.006 --> 00:29:22.436
I won't follow you, so don't run.

371
00:29:23.436 --> 00:29:24.906
You're going to fall.

372
00:29:29.277 --> 00:29:30.577
I know you easily fall down.

373
00:29:32.017 --> 00:29:34.387
I heard the writer wouldn't show up in the shooting site.

374
00:29:35.986 --> 00:29:37.587
Ms. Lee Hyun Soo,

375
00:29:37.956 --> 00:29:40.226
who has a boyfriend and is now a writer, showed up unexpectedly.

376
00:29:47.027 --> 00:29:48.926
- Hyun Soo. - Goodness.

377
00:29:49.027 --> 00:29:52.137
We couldn't wait longer and came up. Did you really go see the filming?

378
00:29:52.137 --> 00:29:53.466
Did you cause a scene?

379
00:29:54.166 --> 00:29:55.867
No, that's not the problem.

380
00:29:56.037 --> 00:29:57.137
Then what is?

381
00:30:04.377 --> 00:30:05.377
Chef.

382
00:30:07.146 --> 00:30:09.347
Why are you here? They're going to start shooting soon.

383
00:30:09.956 --> 00:30:12.017
- I won't do it. - Pardon?

384
00:30:12.716 --> 00:30:15.357
The writer didn't agree on this scene. I won't do it.

385
00:30:15.357 --> 00:30:17.256
You can't do this.

386
00:30:17.827 --> 00:30:19.027
The CEO will be mad.

387
00:30:23.097 --> 00:30:25.896
(Episode 8 will air shortly.)
