00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:06.184
Welcome.

2
00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:07.385
(Episode 11)

3
00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:08.925
Please take the cash.

4
00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:31.314
He is not picking up the phone.

5
00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:33.014
He must have sensed that we are after him.

6
00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:35.715
Track all of his calls and credit card records.

7
00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:37.484
If those don't work, put him on the suspect list.

8
00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:40.855
Sir, suspect list? My brother didn't do anything wrong.

9
00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:46.264
Lawyer Lee, a guest is waiting for you.

10
00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:49.934
A guest? I don't have any appointments today.

11
00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:52.734
A new guest who came in today for the first time.

12
00:00:53.635 --> 00:00:54.674
Oh, yeah?

13
00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.475
I'm sorry. Could you give me a moment?

14
00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.644
- Is this a pro bono? - No, it isn't.

15
00:01:05.644 --> 00:01:07.415
Or have I already fallen behind?

16
00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:08.954
Just because I lost in Park Joon Mo case?

17
00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:11.885
- No way, sir. - Why am I stuck with such client?

18
00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:14.055
You should talk to him first, sir.

19
00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:16.025
There must be a reason why he is here to see you.

20
00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:20.594
Okay.

21
00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:26.434
Good morning. I'm Lawyer Lee Yu Beom.

22
00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:27.904
Your name is?

23
00:01:28.174 --> 00:01:30.174
My name is Kang Dae Hee.

24
00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:32.875
I requested for a lawyer who also was a prosecutor before.

25
00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:33.975
And they told me to come here.

26
00:01:35.714 --> 00:01:37.484
You are right. Please have a seat.

27
00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:42.984
But I don't accept just any cases.

28
00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.924
I have to listen to your case and decide if I can work on it.

29
00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:47.924
Sir.

30
00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:56.464
I can pay as much as you want.

31
00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:03.075
I don't bet on money.

32
00:02:04.105 --> 00:02:05.375
I bet on chances.

33
00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:10.544
Please tell me.

34
00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:13.415
How can I help you?

35
00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:16.285
I'm under a false accusation.

36
00:02:17.454 --> 00:02:20.725
Recently, I was in a car accident by mistake.

37
00:02:21.054 --> 00:02:22.725
And I lost my younger brother.

38
00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:26.494
The police accused me that I faked it all for his insurance.

39
00:02:26.924 --> 00:02:28.994
They even issued me an arrest warrant.

40
00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:31.804
Did the warrant state you killed him on purpose?

41
00:02:31.804 --> 00:02:34.834
No, no. I haven't seen the warrant myself.

42
00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:36.635
I left when the police just arrived.

43
00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:40.075
Then you don't even know what the warrant says.

44
00:02:43.244 --> 00:02:44.915
No, it's not that.

45
00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:46.415
Oh, well.

46
00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:51.385
If I were still a prosecutor, you just made a huge mistake.

47
00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:55.595
But don't worry.

48
00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:57.294
I'm a lawyer now.

49
00:02:57.325 --> 00:02:59.825
Keeping lawyer's ethics, I can't say a word about...

50
00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:04.135
what my client has just said.

51
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.435
If you want to live, lie to a prosecutor.

52
00:03:09.804 --> 00:03:12.044
But to me, tell me what you want.

53
00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:16.315
What you are doing now is shoveling sand against the tide.

54
00:03:20.644 --> 00:03:21.815
I mean...

55
00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:25.885
you have to be honest with me.

56
00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:29.225
So I can fix where it went wrong.

57
00:03:33.764 --> 00:03:35.165
Did you kill your younger brother?

58
00:03:50.784 --> 00:03:51.815
Yes.

59
00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:02.295
What I want from you is...

60
00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:03.854
that in the trial,

61
00:04:05.394 --> 00:04:07.325
make me innocent.

62
00:04:20.974 --> 00:04:25.514
The weather this September is...

63
00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:29.454
similar to the previous year's or slightly hotter.

64
00:04:29.815 --> 00:04:31.925
The criminal who murdered his own brother after his insurance...

65
00:04:31.925 --> 00:04:32.925
When will mine show?

66
00:04:33.154 --> 00:04:35.555
- The prosecutor sentenced him... - It's here.

67
00:04:35.555 --> 00:04:37.024
Reporter Nam Hong Joo reports.

68
00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:40.195
Seoul Hangang District Prosecutors' Office sentenced...

69
00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:42.964
life imprisonment to Kang,

70
00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:46.305
the accused aged 37 for murder and fraud...

71
00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:48.005
in the final trial.

72
00:04:48.735 --> 00:04:52.474
Accused Kang has intentionally killed two of his...

73
00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:54.075
younger siblings for accidental death benefits...

74
00:04:54.075 --> 00:04:56.474
that were put since June 2015.

75
00:04:56.675 --> 00:05:00.985
Kang was imprisoned and prosecuted for the murders.

76
00:05:01.714 --> 00:05:03.414
I'm here with SBC news, Nam Hong Joo.

77
00:05:04.724 --> 00:05:06.485
Seoul Hangang District Prosecutors' Office didn't do anything.

78
00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:08.555
It's Prosecutor Jung who prosecuted him.

79
00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:12.325
So? You think it's unfair?

80
00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:16.235
It's a pity. Not that I think it's unfair.

81
00:05:17.664 --> 00:05:18.704
Is that so?

82
00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:21.635
I was going to comfort you if you felt that it's unfair.

83
00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:25.005
Oh, now that I think twice, it's a bit unfair.

84
00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:29.045
So tell me.

85
00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:31.414
What is it that's so unfair?

86
00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:38.524
What's so unfair?

87
00:05:41.354 --> 00:05:43.094
Tell me, what's unfair?

88
00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:49.394
Gosh, you startled me.

89
00:05:49.495 --> 00:05:50.534
My goodness.

90
00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:53.904
Why are you on my bed?

91
00:05:53.904 --> 00:05:56.104
I came to wake you up, but you pulled me.

92
00:05:56.104 --> 00:05:58.404
You pulled my arm so hard, saying you think it's unfair.

93
00:05:58.404 --> 00:05:59.805
You should have let it go!

94
00:06:00.045 --> 00:06:03.045
Such an easy man you are!

95
00:06:03.945 --> 00:06:04.985
It's disgusting. What am I saying?

96
00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:07.784
Right. You don't know what you are saying too.

97
00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:11.524
Because you are the one who is wrong, and you're ashamed.

98
00:06:11.524 --> 00:06:12.654
Quiet now.

99
00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.354
You want breakfast? Cereal or noodles?

100
00:06:17.724 --> 00:06:19.865
I'm wondering why you're making breakfast for me.

101
00:06:20.094 --> 00:06:22.034
I don't know if I might owe you again.

102
00:06:23.164 --> 00:06:25.135
If something bad happens,

103
00:06:26.235 --> 00:06:28.104
please protect my daughter.

104
00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:32.474
Never mind. I'll have breakfast next door from now on.

105
00:06:32.805 --> 00:06:35.175
From now on? You mean every day?

106
00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:37.274
The lady next door wants to make breakfast for us.

107
00:06:38.784 --> 00:06:39.945
Oh, that's nice.

108
00:06:43.954 --> 00:06:45.625
Their breakfast is so good.

109
00:06:45.724 --> 00:06:47.055
As if you have tried before?

110
00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:49.024
I have tried.

111
00:06:49.894 --> 00:06:50.925
When? Without me?

112
00:06:50.925 --> 00:06:52.425
Yes, when you were not around.

113
00:06:54.235 --> 00:06:56.034
It was many times throughout the day that I didn’t like you.

114
00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:58.635
- Come on. - Don't do it.

115
00:06:59.604 --> 00:07:01.834
- I'm Wolverine. - Don't do it.

116
00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:03.534
Please stop. I hate it.

117
00:07:04.305 --> 00:07:05.305
That hurts.

118
00:07:35.604 --> 00:07:36.635
Mom.

119
00:07:37.505 --> 00:07:40.005
Mom, where is the razor?

120
00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:43.774
Mom, why do I have so much hair on my legs?

121
00:07:46.885 --> 00:07:50.854
I just shaved yesterday, and it grew so much again.

122
00:07:50.854 --> 00:07:53.925
The growing speed is like the speed of light.

123
00:07:53.925 --> 00:07:55.094
And my armpits are worse.

124
00:08:07.474 --> 00:08:10.275
Hey, Hong Joo, say hi.

125
00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:14.075
We're going to have breakfast together from now on.

126
00:08:14.445 --> 00:08:17.645
And the armpits. I mean, the razor is next to the shampoo.

127
00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:20.315
- Search for it again. - Okay.

128
00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:26.384
Welcome.

129
00:08:38.405 --> 00:08:39.535
Goodness.

130
00:08:39.565 --> 00:08:41.474
Hong Joo, you are quite moisturized.

131
00:08:43.905 --> 00:08:45.974
My eyebrows are half gone, like Mona Lisa.

132
00:08:50.645 --> 00:08:53.685
Why couldn't you have given me more eyebrows?

133
00:08:55.754 --> 00:08:57.925
Now, enjoy.

134
00:08:58.825 --> 00:09:02.854
Hong Joo is a very neat and tidy girl.

135
00:09:02.954 --> 00:09:06.364
She won't allow even one single hair left on her leg.

136
00:09:06.364 --> 00:09:07.395
Right. I see.

137
00:09:10.265 --> 00:09:11.665
You have such a huge breakfast every day?

138
00:09:11.704 --> 00:09:13.964
Hey, this is just a regular meal.

139
00:09:13.964 --> 00:09:16.204
Before this, she even made Five Spice Sliced Steamed Pork.

140
00:09:16.704 --> 00:09:18.974
The shabu-shabu you made before was the best thing ever.

141
00:09:18.974 --> 00:09:22.114
That's nice. I'll try to cook again next time.

142
00:09:24.884 --> 00:09:26.445
Welcome to the table.

143
00:09:29.754 --> 00:09:33.655
Mom, you should have told me guests were coming over.

144
00:09:33.655 --> 00:09:37.525
I told you, but the song you turned on was too loud.

145
00:09:38.265 --> 00:09:41.935
It's okay, Hong Joo. Everyone is like that at home.

146
00:09:41.935 --> 00:09:43.594
Being yourself at home.

147
00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:46.334
Oh, not to this level, ma'am.

148
00:09:46.704 --> 00:09:47.935
Stop lying.

149
00:09:48.035 --> 00:09:50.805
My brother doesn't look like a human at home.

150
00:09:53.204 --> 00:09:56.344
I know how your brother looks like at home.

151
00:09:56.374 --> 00:09:57.945
- You saw him? - How do you know?

152
00:09:59.415 --> 00:10:02.984
I have seen your house in my dream many times.

153
00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:07.454
You don't wash your hair for many days and go to work, right?

154
00:10:08.195 --> 00:10:11.895
You're right. I'm scared that he'll have lice.

155
00:10:11.895 --> 00:10:13.795
You take off your socks and pants in any way you want,

156
00:10:13.795 --> 00:10:15.695
and you've never put them in the washing machine yourself.

157
00:10:15.964 --> 00:10:18.964
Why do you open the bathroom door and take a dump?

158
00:10:18.964 --> 00:10:22.204
Right. That's right. What's worse is that...

159
00:10:22.275 --> 00:10:23.405
- he doesn't flush! - He doesn't flush!

160
00:10:24.744 --> 00:10:26.344
You're so good.

161
00:10:26.405 --> 00:10:27.575
How do you know all of this from your dream?

162
00:10:27.575 --> 00:10:29.575
I dream of your brother quite often these days.

163
00:10:29.575 --> 00:10:32.484
I didn't mean to look inside your house, but I just had to.

164
00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:43.795
Who on earth will clean this up?

165
00:10:43.795 --> 00:10:45.525
Why are you using violence?

166
00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:47.124
- Darn you. - Gosh.

167
00:10:47.124 --> 00:10:49.895
Oh, a prosecutor beats an innocent one.

168
00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:04.045
It's a scene nobody should miss.

169
00:11:04.045 --> 00:11:05.945
Stop being so coy.

170
00:11:06.045 --> 00:11:08.415
I haven't said a word for your dignity.

171
00:11:08.415 --> 00:11:09.454
Should I spill some more?

172
00:11:09.915 --> 00:11:11.825
- Hey, Nam Hong Joo. - What!

173
00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:15.994
I admit all that. So stop it now.

174
00:11:16.695 --> 00:11:18.265
Let's all eat now.

175
00:11:29.974 --> 00:11:33.405
I have seen you at home already. Just be yourself now.

176
00:11:34.374 --> 00:11:36.214
Don't act like you're neat.

177
00:11:37.545 --> 00:11:39.945
Your brother will tell me the truth anyway.

178
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:44.285
Are you mad?

179
00:11:48.555 --> 00:11:50.795
You should get on the bus. Aren't you getting on the bus?

180
00:11:52.165 --> 00:11:54.464
- I'm not getting on the bus. - What? Why not?

181
00:11:56.334 --> 00:11:58.405
I have to drop you at your work first.

182
00:12:02.334 --> 00:12:04.645
Ask me to protect you, come and bother me.

183
00:12:04.675 --> 00:12:05.945
Ask me to send you home, and ask me to send you to work.

184
00:12:06.545 --> 00:12:07.545
I will try to.

185
00:12:08.614 --> 00:12:12.015
If it makes me relieved, I will try to.

186
00:12:18.584 --> 00:12:21.895
This was real.

187
00:12:23.094 --> 00:12:24.195
I told you it's real.

188
00:12:47.884 --> 00:12:48.884
Hey, the bus is here.

189
00:12:57.195 --> 00:12:58.695
What are you doing? We'll be late.

190
00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:46.675
(Episode 11: A City of Blinds)

191
00:13:51.984 --> 00:13:54.214
Two boxes of my name cards?

192
00:13:54.315 --> 00:13:57.285
All the people in the prosecutor's offices were...

193
00:13:57.285 --> 00:13:58.655
changed while you were gone.

194
00:13:58.655 --> 00:14:00.854
You should go say hi one by one.

195
00:14:00.954 --> 00:14:02.624
- Two boxes might not be enough. - Yes, sir.

196
00:14:05.525 --> 00:14:07.165
I'm starting this for real.

197
00:14:07.165 --> 00:14:09.565
I will watch what kind of items you bring in.

198
00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:11.964
Police, prosecutor, firemen, and petrols.

199
00:14:12.035 --> 00:14:14.805
What they are investigating and what's their top list,

200
00:14:14.834 --> 00:14:16.675
you must be aware of every little detail, okay?

201
00:14:16.805 --> 00:14:17.844
Even the patrols?

202
00:14:18.545 --> 00:14:19.575
You don't want to?

203
00:14:20.145 --> 00:14:21.614
No, I love it.

204
00:14:22.315 --> 00:14:25.084
I feel so much younger like a freshman.

205
00:14:26.384 --> 00:14:28.384
Shall I report to you every two hours?

206
00:14:28.384 --> 00:14:29.384
That would be nice.

207
00:14:30.584 --> 00:14:33.425
Oh, gosh. I give in.

208
00:14:36.025 --> 00:14:37.055
Welcome...

209
00:14:37.254 --> 00:14:39.025
Good afternoon. We're here again.

210
00:14:43.565 --> 00:14:44.805
Hong Joo is not here today.

211
00:14:44.834 --> 00:14:47.704
We didn't come for her. We're here to have some meat.

212
00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:51.004
I haven't had breakfast, so I should have a heavy meal...

213
00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:52.204
for lunch to stand throughout the day.

214
00:14:53.145 --> 00:14:56.344
And we won't ask for cash receipts.

215
00:14:56.445 --> 00:15:00.754
A tough man won't ask for a bill or a coupon stamp.

216
00:15:00.785 --> 00:15:02.555
We won't ask for such things.

217
00:15:02.714 --> 00:15:03.754
We're done with those.

218
00:15:03.754 --> 00:15:06.224
What's wrong with asking for cash receipts?

219
00:15:06.685 --> 00:15:09.094
It's a fair-trade a policeman should be aware of.

220
00:15:09.094 --> 00:15:10.494
A policeman should not say such things.

221
00:15:16.695 --> 00:15:19.504
Woo Tak, what do I do? I just made a mistake again.

222
00:15:19.504 --> 00:15:21.604
Kyung Han, please!

223
00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:33.214
(Police Station)

224
00:15:36.015 --> 00:15:37.185
Hey, Han Woo Tak!

225
00:15:38.055 --> 00:15:40.325
I mean, Lieutenant Han. Nice to see you here.

226
00:15:40.325 --> 00:15:41.354
What are you doing here?

227
00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:42.925
You two know each other?

228
00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:46.695
- You got a new job? - No, I'm back to my old job.

229
00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:50.295
I can't be pretty all my life.

230
00:15:50.295 --> 00:15:52.464
- I must work hard. - SBC reporter?

231
00:15:53.435 --> 00:15:54.474
You are a reporter?

232
00:15:55.405 --> 00:15:56.675
I'm sorry I didn't know.

233
00:15:57.204 --> 00:15:58.474
How do they know each other?

234
00:15:58.474 --> 00:16:01.114
They don't have much in common.

235
00:16:01.874 --> 00:16:02.974
Hold on.

236
00:16:04.114 --> 00:16:06.945
They seem like they know each other very well.

237
00:16:12.724 --> 00:16:15.454
Hey, don't you have anything on the top list in your office?

238
00:16:15.795 --> 00:16:18.665
I have to report to my senior. I have nothing to report.

239
00:16:20.224 --> 00:16:23.364
Oh, it's my senior. I need something to report.

240
00:16:25.004 --> 00:16:27.435
It's Nam Hong Joo, sir.

241
00:16:28.235 --> 00:16:30.235
I'm here at the third patrol.

242
00:16:30.775 --> 00:16:33.245
Reporting items? Hurry, and give me some.

243
00:16:33.245 --> 00:16:34.844
We have a case where a street cat was killed.

244
00:16:34.844 --> 00:16:37.215
Yes, a street cat was killed.

245
00:16:38.184 --> 00:16:40.914
- It's a serial murder case. - It's a serial killing case, sir.

246
00:16:40.914 --> 00:16:43.184
The number of cats being killed so far is...

247
00:16:43.854 --> 00:16:45.455
Around 100...

248
00:16:45.684 --> 00:16:46.684
100?

249
00:16:48.094 --> 00:16:49.525
Yes, over 100 cats, sir.

250
00:16:50.225 --> 00:16:51.225
Yes, sir.

251
00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:55.094
Okay, sir. All right.

252
00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:01.104
- Sir, I'm back. - Come on in.

253
00:17:03.535 --> 00:17:04.575
Hello.

254
00:17:06.005 --> 00:17:07.174
I don't see Prosecutor Shin here.

255
00:17:07.174 --> 00:17:09.414
She went to monitor the death benefit fraud case.

256
00:17:09.444 --> 00:17:10.575
The death benefit fraud case?

257
00:17:10.575 --> 00:17:12.684
Yes, it's relevant to you too.

258
00:17:13.084 --> 00:17:14.555
- Me? - Yes.

259
00:17:14.584 --> 00:17:16.414
I was here during your duty the other night. Remember?

260
00:17:16.914 --> 00:17:19.854
There was a car accident that night, and I went to examine the dead.

261
00:17:19.854 --> 00:17:23.394
- Yes, I'm aware of it. - It wasn't a simple car accident.

262
00:17:24.225 --> 00:17:25.325
Shall I conduct an autopsy?

263
00:17:25.594 --> 00:17:27.894
No, not the autopsy.

264
00:17:28.664 --> 00:17:31.035
The deceased’s big brother was against the autopsy.

265
00:17:31.334 --> 00:17:35.374
So I had to give an order to pass the deceased one to his family.

266
00:17:35.535 --> 00:17:37.745
But when I investigated this,

267
00:17:38.075 --> 00:17:41.374
the big brother put 2.7 million dollars on the deceased’s insurance.

268
00:17:41.815 --> 00:17:43.715
I had goosebumps all over.

269
00:17:44.245 --> 00:17:46.045
Because the big brother cried so hard for the dead.

270
00:17:46.045 --> 00:17:48.654
But he killed the brother and acted on crying so hard.

271
00:17:48.654 --> 00:17:51.725
He must have acted for 2.7 million dollars.

272
00:17:51.955 --> 00:17:54.995
How could he kill a person for money?

273
00:17:55.055 --> 00:17:56.394
And it's his younger brother.

274
00:17:58.364 --> 00:18:03.035
Kang, the guilty one, has put his two younger siblings...

275
00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:06.434
under a huge death benefit insurance and falsified a car accident.

276
00:18:07.205 --> 00:18:08.934
Is the accused named Kang?

277
00:18:08.975 --> 00:18:11.374
Yes. How do you know that?

278
00:18:11.374 --> 00:18:12.505
Yes, it's Kang Dae Hee.

279
00:18:13.045 --> 00:18:15.815
Is it the case where he killed both of his younger brother and sister?

280
00:18:15.844 --> 00:18:18.914
No, he just killed the brother. The younger sister is alive.

281
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.955
- The younger sister is still alive? - Yes.

282
00:18:22.985 --> 00:18:25.985
But how did you know that he has a younger sister?

283
00:18:27.594 --> 00:18:28.624
Did you see the records?

284
00:18:29.094 --> 00:18:31.664
No, I was confused with another case.

285
00:18:32.565 --> 00:18:35.265
Do you think there is any chance that he becomes innocent?

286
00:18:35.334 --> 00:18:37.035
No way!

287
00:18:37.035 --> 00:18:39.604
He confessed that he killed while we were investigating.

288
00:18:39.604 --> 00:18:41.705
Not a denial but a confession.

289
00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.205
But why did you conduct another direct investigation?

290
00:18:44.174 --> 00:18:46.944
His lawyer is Lee Yu Beom.

291
00:18:55.715 --> 00:18:57.354
Hey, Prosecutor Shin. Hi, Pil Soon.

292
00:18:57.884 --> 00:18:58.955
Hello, Yu Beom.

293
00:19:03.154 --> 00:19:04.325
You have prepared a lot for the trial.

294
00:19:04.364 --> 00:19:06.124
Of course, I have prepared a lot.

295
00:19:06.265 --> 00:19:09.735
You should politely say "No, I haven't".

296
00:19:09.735 --> 00:19:12.305
It's manners to prepare a lot when I have to work against you.

297
00:19:13.404 --> 00:19:15.934
Today's trial is a bit unique. Do you want Coke?

298
00:19:16.134 --> 00:19:18.705
Yes, it was unique. A female jury and...

299
00:19:18.775 --> 00:19:20.444
all the panels were women too.

300
00:19:20.705 --> 00:19:23.775
I think it's the first time ever for two women juries to be in a trial.

301
00:19:26.344 --> 00:19:29.985
It's a bit uncomfortable, but it should be all fair, right?

302
00:19:31.725 --> 00:19:33.785
What is it that makes you uncomfortable?

303
00:19:34.094 --> 00:19:35.094
Sorry?

304
00:19:36.654 --> 00:19:41.235
What's wrong with female juries?

305
00:19:43.894 --> 00:19:48.104
Are you Ms. Kim Joo Young, the Assistant Chief Jury?

306
00:19:48.434 --> 00:19:49.535
Nice to meet you.

307
00:19:50.805 --> 00:19:54.005
No, it's not that it's uncomfortable. It's rather unique.

308
00:19:54.114 --> 00:19:56.015
Usually, it's all male jury.

309
00:19:56.015 --> 00:19:57.015
That's my point.

310
00:19:57.944 --> 00:20:01.815
When all the jury were men, you never said anything about being fair.

311
00:20:01.985 --> 00:20:06.255
Now you mention about being fair to jury who are all ladies.

312
00:20:07.184 --> 00:20:11.265
Aren't male jury more likely to be unfair...

313
00:20:11.525 --> 00:20:13.495
than female jury?

314
00:20:15.495 --> 00:20:17.705
I really don't understand you.

315
00:20:21.604 --> 00:20:25.874
She's right. If all the jury were men,

316
00:20:26.275 --> 00:20:28.745
being fair should not only apply to women.

317
00:20:28.844 --> 00:20:32.215
I'm sorry, Lawyer Lee, the Jury already doesn't like you.

318
00:20:32.285 --> 00:20:36.114
Right. I'll lose to Prosecutor Shin today.

319
00:20:36.114 --> 00:20:39.154
The cases are different.

320
00:20:41.295 --> 00:20:42.424
(Trial In Process)

321
00:20:46.424 --> 00:20:49.495
You said you bet on chances.

322
00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:52.465
- That's right. - How big is my chance?

323
00:20:53.035 --> 00:20:54.334
It's around 99 percent.

324
00:20:57.174 --> 00:20:58.245
Are we the one percent?

325
00:20:58.275 --> 00:20:59.475
All rise, please.

327
00:21:15.995 --> 00:21:18.765
Straighten your shoulders. We're the 99 percent.

328
00:21:20.594 --> 00:21:22.735
The chance of being guilty is 99 percent.

329
00:21:22.894 --> 00:21:25.364
I deducted one percent because Yu Beom is the lawyer this time.

330
00:21:25.364 --> 00:21:28.005
But in fact, it's 100 percent that he's guilty.

331
00:21:28.005 --> 00:21:29.874
You really think there is no chance that he is innocent?

332
00:21:29.874 --> 00:21:32.205
Why are you wishing for him to be guilty?

333
00:21:32.575 --> 00:21:34.005
Is there anything you know?

334
00:21:34.575 --> 00:21:37.584
No, but we have to be careful with every single thing.

335
00:21:37.584 --> 00:21:40.315
You are not being careful in my heart.

336
00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:41.455
You better be careful alone.

337
00:21:42.785 --> 00:21:46.124
If he is innocent, I will die.

338
00:21:46.124 --> 00:21:50.055
I haven't even dissected the deceased’s body too.

339
00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:57.265
Stop sighing on me!

340
00:21:58.434 --> 00:22:00.205
- We can do it. - Yes, we can do it.

341
00:22:00.604 --> 00:22:03.904
Prosecutor, please state your point to the charge.

342
00:22:03.904 --> 00:22:04.904
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:22:05.775 --> 00:22:09.315
The accused Kang Dae Hee has put his brother and sister...

344
00:22:09.315 --> 00:22:11.815
as insurants since June, 2015.

345
00:22:11.944 --> 00:22:15.184
And he set himself as a beneficiary for over 31 life insurances.

346
00:22:15.184 --> 00:22:18.384
Kang's been paying over 4,000 dollars per month for insurances.

347
00:22:18.384 --> 00:22:19.384
I see.

348
00:22:19.884 --> 00:22:22.825
His income source had gone wrong when his stocks investments...

349
00:22:22.894 --> 00:22:25.965
went wrong and to get the death benefits from the insurances,

350
00:22:26.194 --> 00:22:29.565
he decided to falsify a car accident in which...

351
00:22:29.664 --> 00:22:31.834
his brother ended up being killed.

352
00:22:38.604 --> 00:22:41.775
On March 28 at 9pm, the accused was on his way...

353
00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:45.144
to send his brother home and he intentionally hit the gate.

354
00:22:45.344 --> 00:22:49.055
This ended up killing his brother.

355
00:22:50.614 --> 00:22:54.594
Moreover, the accused has reported false information on...

356
00:22:54.594 --> 00:22:57.864
the fake car accident case to seven insurance companies...

357
00:22:58.164 --> 00:23:01.134
and claimed 27 million dollars in total.

358
00:23:02.035 --> 00:23:04.065
For this, the accused, based on Criminal Law Article 250,

359
00:23:04.065 --> 00:23:06.104
is charged with murdering.

360
00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:10.035
Criminal Law Article 347-1 adds fraud to his crimes...

361
00:23:10.035 --> 00:23:11.205
and shall be prosecuted based on these.

362
00:23:14.414 --> 00:23:17.944
Lawyer Lee. Do you admit to the charges?

363
00:23:24.455 --> 00:23:27.354
No, I plead not guilty to the entire charges.

364
00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:30.765
The accused...

365
00:23:33.225 --> 00:23:34.465
claims innocence to all charges.

366
00:23:51.715 --> 00:23:53.715
Kang Dae Hee is claiming innocence to his charges?

367
00:23:53.715 --> 00:23:57.485
Yes, sir. I was worried that he'd cry for mercy,

368
00:23:57.485 --> 00:24:00.384
but it's better this way. It's easier to prosecute now.

369
00:24:00.384 --> 00:24:02.394
Lee Yu Beom is being reckless this time.

370
00:24:02.394 --> 00:24:04.025
It's a confession case. Why bother flipping it?

371
00:24:04.295 --> 00:24:07.834
Don't you think Lawyer Lee has made him confess for a reason?

372
00:24:08.035 --> 00:24:11.205
When a confession is made, they investigate less.

373
00:24:12.235 --> 00:24:14.134
What's wrong with you, Prosecutor Jung?

374
00:24:14.174 --> 00:24:17.134
Your big mouth said something similar last time.

375
00:24:17.174 --> 00:24:20.245
Well, his big mouth sounds quite reasonable this time.

376
00:24:20.374 --> 00:24:22.174
Confession could have been a smart strategy.

377
00:24:22.174 --> 00:24:25.315
They investigate less and can prove better in the trial.

378
00:24:25.414 --> 00:24:27.315
Why are you on his side?

379
00:24:27.315 --> 00:24:29.354
Put down your little heart.

380
00:24:29.785 --> 00:24:30.825
Sir!

381
00:24:31.955 --> 00:24:33.325
Why are you praying alone?

382
00:24:35.055 --> 00:24:38.424
Let's now all pray separately.

383
00:24:39.265 --> 00:24:44.065
Prosecutor Shin, don't ignore his advice.

384
00:24:44.634 --> 00:24:46.864
Of course not, sir.

385
00:24:48.305 --> 00:24:52.174
Prosecutor Jung, thank you a lot...

386
00:24:52.844 --> 00:24:53.944
for your hearty advice.

387
00:24:54.414 --> 00:24:58.485
I thought those advice could only be made by those who have…

388
00:24:58.584 --> 00:25:00.515
over 20 years of experience. It's been only a few months for you.

389
00:25:00.515 --> 00:25:03.184
How could you possibly give me such experienced advice?

390
00:25:05.654 --> 00:25:07.055
I'd like to learn too.

391
00:25:12.265 --> 00:25:13.525
Was it a compliment?

392
00:25:19.265 --> 00:25:22.005
Compliment? She was embarrassing me!

393
00:25:22.374 --> 00:25:24.374
Why do you twist her words?

394
00:25:24.705 --> 00:25:26.075
Maybe she really wants to learn.

395
00:25:26.444 --> 00:25:29.344
What she meant was that I crossed the line and should stop.

396
00:25:29.344 --> 00:25:30.815
Can't you distinguish sarcasm?

397
00:25:30.884 --> 00:25:32.414
What's your score in literature?

398
00:25:32.414 --> 00:25:35.854
Why are you taking it out on me?

399
00:25:36.515 --> 00:25:38.525
I dream a lot about your brother.

400
00:25:38.684 --> 00:25:41.455
So I get to see a lot of what's happening in your house.

401
00:25:44.725 --> 00:25:48.535
Oh, right, my little brother. I should not take it out on you.

402
00:25:48.535 --> 00:25:50.904
What's wrong with you? Is anybody here?

403
00:25:51.005 --> 00:25:53.864
Please lift your feet. I need to vacuum there.

404
00:25:57.444 --> 00:26:00.104
What's with your hair? Your hair's all messy at home.

405
00:26:00.374 --> 00:26:02.075
You put on BB cream too?

406
00:26:02.414 --> 00:26:03.475
I didn't.

407
00:26:03.475 --> 00:26:08.184
Yes, you did. Why would you put on BB cream at home?

408
00:26:09.654 --> 00:26:11.354
Is it because she can see you in her dream?

409
00:26:11.424 --> 00:26:14.525
No, shut your mouth now, little brat.

410
00:26:15.894 --> 00:26:17.295
So it's true.

411
00:26:17.354 --> 00:26:19.495
You're doing house chores and wearing nice clothes at home...

412
00:26:19.565 --> 00:26:21.295
because she can see you.

413
00:26:21.334 --> 00:26:23.565
You're making quite a show.

414
00:26:23.565 --> 00:26:24.965
I'll get you, little brat.

415
00:26:24.965 --> 00:26:28.174
I have seen how you are at home.

416
00:26:28.275 --> 00:26:32.874
Don't act like you are neat. Your brother tells me everything.

417
00:26:34.745 --> 00:26:36.374
Oh, she dreamed this too.

418
00:26:36.374 --> 00:26:39.045
She's like a human surveillance camera.

419
00:26:39.315 --> 00:26:42.515
I'm going mad!

420
00:26:42.515 --> 00:26:43.715
You're scaring me.

421
00:26:44.624 --> 00:26:45.955
I'm seriously getting dizzy.

422
00:26:47.924 --> 00:26:50.795
So what's happening to the Sangbu-dong street cat serial killings?

423
00:26:50.795 --> 00:26:52.465
Update me on your report.

424
00:26:52.465 --> 00:26:56.065
So when I examined this, it was only 1 or 2 cats a few months ago.

425
00:26:56.065 --> 00:26:57.904
But now the serial killing scale got bigger.

426
00:26:57.965 --> 00:27:01.005
Over 100 cats died so far.

427
00:27:01.104 --> 00:27:02.104
- That's unbelievable. - Goodness.

428
00:27:02.104 --> 00:27:03.104
Who killed all the cats?

429
00:27:03.104 --> 00:27:06.505
All the cats died of poison. None of them had external bruises.

430
00:27:07.045 --> 00:27:09.144
Police think that there has to be one suspect.

431
00:27:09.144 --> 00:27:11.384
Keep reporting on it until the suspect gets caught.

432
00:27:11.384 --> 00:27:13.545
Do I have to follow this case?

433
00:27:13.545 --> 00:27:16.084
I think the TV show "Animal Farm" should air something about it.

434
00:27:16.084 --> 00:27:18.555
Why? I think it has a story.

435
00:27:18.924 --> 00:27:21.725
It's like a pre-warning before the serial killing.

436
00:27:21.755 --> 00:27:24.295
One of the typical signs is the animal abuses.

437
00:27:24.525 --> 00:27:27.025
It's like a rehearsal before the actual serial killing on people.

438
00:27:27.394 --> 00:27:29.694
He killed over 100 cats.

439
00:27:29.995 --> 00:27:32.634
Who is the suspect? What kind of traits does he have?

440
00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:34.134
Am I the only one who cares?

441
00:27:34.134 --> 00:27:36.075
- No. - No, we all care.

442
00:27:36.075 --> 00:27:37.545
- He makes sense. - Right.

443
00:27:37.545 --> 00:27:39.275
He made a point.

444
00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:41.545
What's wrong with you?

445
00:27:41.545 --> 00:27:44.384
I want to cover humans, not cats.

446
00:27:58.565 --> 00:27:59.565
Jae Chan.

447
00:28:01.065 --> 00:28:03.834
If you've seen the moment in your dream...

448
00:28:26.084 --> 00:28:27.124
Kang Dae Hee...

449
00:28:28.225 --> 00:28:29.255
Why was he there?

450
00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:39.981
(Episode 12 will air shortly.)
