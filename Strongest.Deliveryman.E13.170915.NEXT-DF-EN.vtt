00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:15.861
Don't leave.

3
00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.563
I'll try my best to make you happy.

<i>[Episode 13]</i>

5
00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:29.664
Did you sleep well?

6
00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:32.614
Yeah.

7
00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:35.679
Why are you smiling?

8
00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.694
- Because you're pretty.
- You're crazy.

9
00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:41.852
Isn't there anything you want to eat?

10
00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:43.406
I'll make you something delicious.

11
00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:46.191
- Go and make some ramen or something.
- Ramen? Okay.

12
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:50.316
But... I don't think there's
any more ramen, Ms. Lee Dan Ah.

13
00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:53.641
Go and buy some, please.

14
00:01:55.923 --> 00:01:57.531
- Whoa!
- You head back to Seoul first.

15
00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:00.066
I'm going to stop by
my house first.

16
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:01.775
Should we all go together
and greet your parents, then?

17
00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:03.706
Next time. See you guys
at the office tomorrow.

18
00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:04.742
Yeah.

19
00:02:04.742 --> 00:02:05.992
- I'm off.
- All right.

20
00:02:07.257 --> 00:02:08.958
I'm a bit concerned.

21
00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.182
Min Chan's parents will be quite angry

22
00:02:10.182 --> 00:02:12.926
if they find out he's given up on
getting hired at a large company.

23
00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:21.371
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.028
No. I'm okay with it,
as long as you are.

25
00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:27.163
Father.

26
00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:28.990
All right, then.
Do your best.

27
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.991
You've always done your best,
no matter what you did.

28
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:32.258
That's all you need to do.

29
00:02:32.258 --> 00:02:34.149
If you do that,
things will all go well.

30
00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:38.615
Yeah.

31
00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:43.705
But, um, who are those folks?

32
00:02:46.057 --> 00:02:47.601
Oh... Kang Soo!

33
00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:50.919
Hello!

34
00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.580
Nice to meet you.
My name is Choi Kang Soo.

35
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.289
This is the CEO of our company.

36
00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:56.901
Oh, I see!

37
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:59.658
Please take good care
of my Min Chan, sir.

38
00:03:00.674 --> 00:03:02.340
Yes, I will!
Thank you!

39
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.734
We'll do our best.

40
00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:12.925
Come at me, Choi Kang Soo!

41
00:03:14.052 --> 00:03:15.448
Here!

42
00:03:15.448 --> 00:03:17.024
Hyah!
Ms. Dan Ah!

43
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.340
Do your best, Kang Soo!

44
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.578
Let's get some rest today
and work hard tomorrow!

45
00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:05.271
Yeah, you worked hard, too.

46
00:04:05.271 --> 00:04:07.266
All right, disperse!

47
00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:09.746
We're the only ones who need
to leave, Gong Gi.

48
00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:11.093
Oh, is that right?

49
00:04:11.622 --> 00:04:12.973
Only we shall disperse, then!

50
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:16.155
Have a safe trip home!

51
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.272
You worked hard.

52
00:04:19.272 --> 00:04:20.419
Want me to drop you off at home?

53
00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.659
Um, no. It's fine.

54
00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:22.921
I'll be going now.

55
00:04:42.217 --> 00:04:44.602
<i>Won't you let me make you happy?</i>

56
00:04:44.602 --> 00:04:45.719
<i>Don't leave.</i>

57
00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.566
<i>I'll try my best to make you happy.</i>

58
00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:51.958
Are you just getting back?

59
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.803
Huh?
Um, yeah.

60
00:04:54.803 --> 00:04:56.503
And why are you touching
your lip like that?

61
00:04:56.503 --> 00:04:58.073
What'd you do with
that mouth of yours?

62
00:04:58.073 --> 00:05:00.787
- W-what?
- You kissed all night, didn't you?

63
00:05:00.787 --> 00:05:02.731
What on earth are you talking about?

64
00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:06.638
Yeah, I think we're past the point
of resolving this with just words.

65
00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:09.260
Dad?

66
00:05:17.253 --> 00:05:18.392
Master.

67
00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:21.220
Put your martial arts uniform on.

68
00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.890
All right, let's get started.

69
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.958
Um, Master. I've had a really
bad back lately, so...

70
00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.635
And my knee hurts, too.

71
00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:38.381
Hyah! Hurry up and come at me!

72
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:41.981
But Master! My body really isn't
as nimble as it used to be!

73
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:44.023
Let's spar next time.

74
00:05:44.023 --> 00:05:46.184
I'll come at you first, then!

75
00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:02.340
Ow, Master!

76
00:06:03.652 --> 00:06:05.458
You really have become
pathetic, haven't you?

77
00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:06.921
Your passion has been
extinguished completely!

78
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:08.191
That's not true, Master.

79
00:06:08.191 --> 00:06:10.316
I still have a stubborn streak!

80
00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:13.888
No, you've changed.
Your spirit has died!

81
00:06:13.888 --> 00:06:15.662
It's because she's dating, Dad.

82
00:06:16.157 --> 00:06:17.487
You pipe down.

83
00:06:17.487 --> 00:06:18.737
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:19.636 --> 00:06:21.725
Do not disappoint me any further.

85
00:06:21.725 --> 00:06:24.330
If you cannot show me even
an ounce of skill

86
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.347
I will charge you for all the
free lessons I gave to you.

87
00:06:27.347 --> 00:06:30.532
You've been taking them for 15 years
since you were six years old

88
00:06:30.532 --> 00:06:32.450
so it'll be at least  10 million won!

89
00:06:33.147 --> 00:06:35.333
All right, then.
I'm coming at you!

90
00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.244
- Dad!
- Master!

91
00:06:50.883 --> 00:06:52.996
- Dad!
- I'm okay.

92
00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.347
What happened?
Oh, goodness!

93
00:06:56.474 --> 00:06:58.148
What happened to you?

94
00:06:58.602 --> 00:07:01.905
Sorry.
I drank a lot of alcohol, you see.

95
00:07:01.905 --> 00:07:02.922
Ugh!

96
00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.321
Oh gosh!

97
00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:05.972
So you're not dead yet, eh?

98
00:07:05.972 --> 00:07:08.924
You truly are
the best student I've ever had!

99
00:07:08.924 --> 00:07:10.234
- Ugh!
- Dad!

100
00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:23.463
What brings you to Seoul?

101
00:07:23.463 --> 00:07:26.775
I was just curious about how
you two were getting by.

102
00:07:27.357 --> 00:07:29.225
So, you're dating, eh?

103
00:07:30.573 --> 00:07:31.621
Yes.

104
00:07:31.621 --> 00:07:33.128
What kind of man is he?

105
00:07:33.128 --> 00:07:35.958
He's just... really kind.

106
00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.116
Just really kind...

107
00:07:38.155 --> 00:07:39.926
Well, as long as he's kind,
it's okay.

108
00:07:40.554 --> 00:07:42.361
But what have you been up to
in the meantime?

109
00:07:42.991 --> 00:07:45.998
Dan Ah is great at English
and has a great relationship.

110
00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:47.657
I'm just... you know.

111
00:07:47.657 --> 00:07:49.063
How's she getting by?

112
00:07:49.063 --> 00:07:50.787
She drinks and comes home late
a lot nowadays.

113
00:07:50.787 --> 00:07:52.366
- Hey.
- And she walks around practically naked.

114
00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:53.433
Lee Dan Ah!

115
00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:00.080
Put your martial arts uniform on.

116
00:08:00.556 --> 00:08:03.157
I only ever learned self-defense, Dad.

117
00:08:03.157 --> 00:08:05.097
- Hurry up.
- No!

118
00:08:05.097 --> 00:08:06.758
Oh gosh, I'm drunk!
Ugh!

119
00:08:06.758 --> 00:08:07.970
I said, hurry up and put it on!

120
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.712
Dad, the sky is spinning.

121
00:08:09.712 --> 00:08:12.065
Ugh.
Give me a piggyback ride.

122
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:19.583
Oh, you!

123
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.088
You truly are my daughter, eh?

124
00:08:22.857 --> 00:08:24.448
Dad.

125
00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:28.356
I really want to succeed.

126
00:08:30.023 --> 00:08:34.267
I really want to make her happy.

127
00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:42.977
Kang Soo.

128
00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:45.183
Hyun Soo.

129
00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:48.198
Are you really going
to be like this to me?

130
00:08:48.198 --> 00:08:51.039
How could you call Sung Jae
over, but not me?

131
00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:53.568
You... need to get more rest.

132
00:08:53.568 --> 00:08:54.851
Ugh.

133
00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:56.617
Why does everyone
keep telling me that?

134
00:08:56.617 --> 00:08:58.302
You were sick, after all.

135
00:08:58.302 --> 00:09:00.712
I'm all better now.
I'll report to work starting tomorrow.

136
00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:05.919
What is it?

137
00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:07.621
I told you, I'm really
all better now!

138
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:09.382
Do you want to arm-wrestle me?

139
00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:21.615
Go where?
No, I'm staying here.

140
00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:23.093
What are you saying?

141
00:09:23.093 --> 00:09:25.091
Are you going to live at a
sauna for the rest of your life?

142
00:09:25.091 --> 00:09:27.230
Yeah. This place is the best.

143
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.040
I can take care of everything here.

144
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.381
What about your spending, then?

145
00:09:30.381 --> 00:09:32.432
It costs 9,000 won per day to come here,
and you eat 3 meals a day.

146
00:09:32.432 --> 00:09:34.480
You're buying eggs and drinks, too!

147
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.736
You sure do eat a lot!

148
00:09:36.736 --> 00:09:39.257
I'm paying for it with my
card anyway!

149
00:09:39.257 --> 00:09:41.536
Why is it yours?
You gave it to me, so it's mine.

150
00:09:41.536 --> 00:09:43.155
Don't talk back,
and just follow me.

151
00:09:43.155 --> 00:09:45.140
Why? Where are we going?

152
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.410
You'll see.

153
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.158
Ugh, I don't like the sound of this.

154
00:09:49.158 --> 00:09:52.222
Shut your mouth.
Hurry up and follow me.

155
00:10:02.757 --> 00:10:03.851
Oh my.

156
00:10:03.851 --> 00:10:05.313
I, um, haven't washed up yet.

157
00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:08.829
Wait.
Wait, sirs. Wait.

158
00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:10.139
Wait...

159
00:10:18.158 --> 00:10:19.309
A favor?

160
00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:21.929
Yeah, please keep an eye
on Yeon Ji.

161
00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:24.198
Something about her
is definitely off.

162
00:10:24.756 --> 00:10:25.879
What do you mean?

163
00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:28.356
Just the sound of her voice when
she talks to me on the phone.

164
00:10:28.843 --> 00:10:31.819
And she couldn't seem to meet
my gaze today, too.

165
00:10:31.819 --> 00:10:33.475
So keep a close eye on her.

166
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:39.392
Drink this before you go, Dad.

167
00:10:39.392 --> 00:10:40.800
Don't throw up on the train.

168
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.342
Is this the most effective one?

169
00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:44.751
I don't know. I just saw it,
so I bought it.

170
00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:46.655
All right, thanks.

171
00:10:46.655 --> 00:10:47.805
You two should go home now.

172
00:10:47.805 --> 00:10:49.727
Oh, there's a cab!

173
00:10:52.892 --> 00:10:54.015
Dad!

174
00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.824
Get home safely!

175
00:10:59.824 --> 00:11:02.903
- All right, bye.
- Goodbye, Master!

176
00:11:06.757 --> 00:11:09.055
How could he lose to his disciple?

177
00:11:10.073 --> 00:11:13.043
Hey, he just went easy on me, is all.

178
00:11:13.043 --> 00:11:16.789
No. He definitely lost that one,
fair and square.

179
00:11:17.475 --> 00:11:19.539
I guess my dad's gotten old.

180
00:11:20.837 --> 00:11:24.087
Oh yeah, did you know that someone
moved in to the third floor?

181
00:11:24.087 --> 00:11:26.069
Oh, really?
What's their job?

182
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:27.971
I'm not sure about that, but...

183
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.827
she had a message for you.

184
00:11:30.488 --> 00:11:31.946
She said, "Ji Yoon has moved in."

185
00:11:31.946 --> 00:11:33.179
What?

186
00:11:37.413 --> 00:11:41.618
I have to buy a rice cooker,
and spoons.

187
00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:42.769
Hey.

188
00:11:43.406 --> 00:11:44.608
Untie me right now.

189
00:11:44.608 --> 00:11:46.399
Oh, and I need bowls, too.

190
00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:48.183
Hey, are you out of your mind?

191
00:11:48.183 --> 00:11:49.866
How could you bring me
to this neighborhood?

192
00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:51.151
How could I possibly stay here?

193
00:11:52.523 --> 00:11:54.663
Why?
Why can't you stay here?

194
00:11:54.663 --> 00:11:57.367
It's much better than a new neighborhood
where you don't know anyone.

195
00:11:57.367 --> 00:11:59.687
You have me, and a friend
like Mister, too.

196
00:11:59.687 --> 00:12:00.766
Right?

197
00:12:01.257 --> 00:12:03.331
I don't feel like explaining, and...

198
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:05.621
Just let me go!
This is a crime, you know!

199
00:12:05.997 --> 00:12:10.010
All right, I'll untie you if you
promise me that you'll sit still.

200
00:12:10.545 --> 00:12:12.871
All right, all right.
I'll do that.

201
00:12:13.461 --> 00:12:14.879
I promise to sit still.

202
00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:17.097
If you're going to sit still, it doesn't
matter if you're tied up or not.

203
00:12:17.097 --> 00:12:18.121
Hey...

204
00:12:24.102 --> 00:12:25.233
Who is it?

205
00:12:25.233 --> 00:12:26.736
<i>Hey, open the door!</i>

206
00:12:26.736 --> 00:12:28.184
<i>It's me, Dan Ah!</i>

207
00:12:28.184 --> 00:12:29.761
Dan Ah...
It's Dan Ah.

208
00:12:29.761 --> 00:12:30.867
Just a moment!

209
00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:33.334
- It's Dan Ah.
- Shush!

210
00:12:33.773 --> 00:12:35.206
Dan Ah!

211
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.130
What are you doing right now?

212
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.246
I told you not to move here!

213
00:12:43.246 --> 00:12:45.874
<i>I'm sorry.
I had no choice.</i>

214
00:12:45.874 --> 00:12:48.121
This is the only place I could find
at this size for this price.

215
00:12:48.121 --> 00:12:50.853
- Ugh.
- I promise to be a quiet neighbor.

216
00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:53.831
I won't inconvenience you
even this much.

217
00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:57.560
- Damn it.
- Ugh!

218
00:12:58.158 --> 00:13:00.033
It's not like she owns this building.

219
00:13:03.841 --> 00:13:06.173
- She left.
- Dan Ah lives here too?

220
00:13:06.173 --> 00:13:07.286
Yes.

221
00:13:09.661 --> 00:13:11.044
No!

222
00:13:12.702 --> 00:13:14.054
No!

223
00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:15.357
Are you out of your mind?

224
00:13:15.357 --> 00:13:16.453
Why?

225
00:13:16.453 --> 00:13:18.579
Am I not allowed to live in the
same building as Dan Ah?

226
00:13:20.294 --> 00:13:23.028
Did you two not get along
when you worked together?

227
00:13:23.028 --> 00:13:25.908
Did she hit you too,
by any chance?

228
00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:29.761
Why would she have hit me?

229
00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:31.673
You have nothing to worry about, then!

230
00:13:31.673 --> 00:13:35.900
Wait, wait, please.
Please, untie this. Please!

231
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.871
- Please.
- I'll do it tomorrow morning.

232
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:39.058
Good night.

233
00:13:40.329 --> 00:13:43.530
All right, let's get you on
the blanket.

234
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.838
- Wait, wait.
- There we go!

235
00:13:47.865 --> 00:13:49.717
Lie down properly!
The pillow is here.

236
00:13:49.717 --> 00:13:53.925
How can I lie down properly
when I'm tied up, huh?

237
00:13:53.925 --> 00:13:56.433
- There we go, all done!
- Damn it!

238
00:13:56.433 --> 00:13:57.703
Good night!

239
00:13:57.703 --> 00:14:00.010
Hey!

240
00:14:03.514 --> 00:14:04.954
Aren't you going to sleep?

241
00:14:04.954 --> 00:14:07.265
No, I still have some
work left to do.

242
00:14:14.867 --> 00:14:15.915
Yeah, Mom?

243
00:14:16.467 --> 00:14:18.044
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

244
00:14:18.044 --> 00:14:19.478
Seoul.

245
00:14:19.478 --> 00:14:21.158
I told you that I was going
to see Kang Soo.

246
00:14:21.158 --> 00:14:22.424
<i>And I said that you couldn't.</i>

247
00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:24.702
Well, why not?

248
00:14:24.702 --> 00:14:26.346
<i>Just no, okay?</i>

249
00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:31.033
Kang Soo.

250
00:14:31.677 --> 00:14:33.433
Please talk to her for me.

251
00:14:39.028 --> 00:14:42.517
<i>[Mom]</i>

252
00:14:46.512 --> 00:14:47.812
Yes?

253
00:14:49.158 --> 00:14:52.226
<i>Send Hyun Soo back here, now.</i>

254
00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:55.120
Hyun Soo can take care of himself.

255
00:14:55.558 --> 00:14:57.832
Hyun Soo is an adult now, too.

256
00:14:57.832 --> 00:14:59.476
<i>Kang Soo.</i>

257
00:14:59.476 --> 00:15:01.565
I'm hanging up now.

258
00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:10.871
Wow, you're really good at
shutting up my mom.

259
00:15:11.488 --> 00:15:12.844
Get some sleep.

260
00:15:14.317 --> 00:15:15.793
Want me to put down a blanket for you?

261
00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:18.223
No, I might stay up all night.

262
00:15:18.223 --> 00:15:19.839
Get some sleep.

263
00:15:40.087 --> 00:15:41.477
Mr. Jin Kyu.

264
00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:45.203
Wake up!
It's morning!

265
00:15:48.624 --> 00:15:51.203
Did you sleep okay?

266
00:16:03.336 --> 00:16:05.193
Do you think you would've slept well
if you'd been in my shoes?

267
00:16:05.193 --> 00:16:08.179
But wasn't it much better than sleeping
all curled up at the park, though?

268
00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:09.398
Ugh!

269
00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:13.208
Here, have some breakfast.

270
00:16:14.227 --> 00:16:15.798
Are you trying to fatten me up?

271
00:16:15.798 --> 00:16:18.158
It's just good to help each other
out, as fellow lonely people.

272
00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:19.712
Well, I'm not lonely.

273
00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:22.506
"Lonely" means that you have nobody
by your side when you need them...

274
00:16:22.506 --> 00:16:23.947
Hey, are you listening?

275
00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:27.515
I... don't need anyone.

276
00:16:27.515 --> 00:16:28.924
Well, it seems to me that you do.

277
00:16:28.924 --> 00:16:31.798
- Why are you so forceful?
- I'm not.

278
00:16:31.798 --> 00:16:34.087
I'm trying to discipline you and
steer you in the right direction.

279
00:16:34.087 --> 00:16:37.740
When someone is immature, they need
a guardian to show them the way.

280
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.784
What?

281
00:16:38.784 --> 00:16:41.554
It was the same for me when I ran away
from home and had nowhere to go.

282
00:16:41.554 --> 00:16:43.563
My ideas became more and more reckless

283
00:16:43.563 --> 00:16:45.592
and my IQ kept going down.

284
00:16:45.592 --> 00:16:48.256
I feel like my IQ dropped to
that of a 5-year-old's.

285
00:16:48.256 --> 00:16:50.515
I have no idea
what you're trying to say.

286
00:16:50.515 --> 00:16:53.708
Acting like you don't know what I'm
saying when you do makes you a bad kid!

287
00:16:53.708 --> 00:16:54.895
Ugh!

288
00:16:56.314 --> 00:16:59.028
I barely managed to regain my senses
when Mister helped me

289
00:16:59.028 --> 00:17:01.640
while I was starving on the street
and had no hope.

290
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.650
That's why I'm paying it
forward to you, Mr. Jin Kyu.

291
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.765
So hurry up and get your act together,
and help someone else.

292
00:17:07.765 --> 00:17:10.534
If you do, our world will become
a much better place.

293
00:17:10.534 --> 00:17:11.768
Are you running for
office or something?

294
00:17:11.768 --> 00:17:13.117
Hurry up and eat that.
Your noodles will get overcooked.

295
00:17:20.766 --> 00:17:23.071
I have another cup noodle,
so eat that for lunch.

296
00:17:23.071 --> 00:17:25.194
And you can boil the water
in this coffee pot.

297
00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:27.714
You're not going to tie me up
before you leave?

298
00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.012
You have nowhere to go anyway.

299
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:31.527
See you in the evening, then.

300
00:17:41.256 --> 00:17:44.768
Oh, hello, Ms. Dan Ah!
Where are you coming from?

301
00:17:44.768 --> 00:17:46.064
None of your business.

302
00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:47.700
Um, wait.

303
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.688
Where do I buy things
like spoons and such?

304
00:17:49.688 --> 00:17:51.325
Go to the supermarket.

305
00:17:51.325 --> 00:17:52.643
And where is that, exactly?

306
00:17:52.643 --> 00:17:55.575
Go toward the subway stop
for Line 4, and then take the bus.

307
00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:56.669
Which bus do I take?

308
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:58.585
There's directions there
when you go there.

309
00:17:58.585 --> 00:17:59.659
All right.

310
00:18:00.573 --> 00:18:02.198
Wait. Wait!

311
00:18:02.198 --> 00:18:03.632
What do you want now?

312
00:18:03.632 --> 00:18:07.131
I'm sorry, but can you be more
careful when you walk at home?

313
00:18:07.131 --> 00:18:08.698
It's super loud.

314
00:18:08.698 --> 00:18:12.977
Sorry, but just plug up
your ears instead.

315
00:18:17.056 --> 00:18:19.591
Wow, she's so rude.

316
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:22.149
Mister really has bad taste in women!

317
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:25.383
This is the Jung Family building.
All items are available for breakfast.

318
00:18:25.383 --> 00:18:29.399
Please eat breakfast here from now on!
We open at 6 a.m. now.

319
00:18:36.056 --> 00:18:38.419
Hello, we're from Jung Family Foods.

320
00:18:47.056 --> 00:18:49.592
<i>They really are a force
to be reckoned with.</i>

321
00:18:52.593 --> 00:18:53.941
Their prices are super cheap

322
00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:55.358
but if they do a lot of
advertising like this

323
00:18:55.358 --> 00:18:58.272
the other restaurants
really have no chance.

324
00:18:58.272 --> 00:19:01.098
Will they be able to handle such
a large number of customers, though?

325
00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:05.198
Jung Family Seolleongtang had issues
because of the influx of customers.

326
00:19:05.254 --> 00:19:07.272
No, I think that things are
different this time around.

327
00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:11.998
Now, there isn't a single customer who
came here because of the wait time there.

328
00:19:11.998 --> 00:19:14.286
How is this possible?

329
00:19:16.044 --> 00:19:18.281
Let's go there.

330
00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:19.680
Okay.

331
00:19:20.338 --> 00:19:22.877
Welcome to Jung Family Hangover Stew!

332
00:19:22.877 --> 00:19:25.114
I'm sorry, we don't have
any more free seats.

333
00:19:25.114 --> 00:19:28.210
Would you mind going to Jung Family
Kimchi Stew on the third floor?

334
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.438
If you do that, we'll bring you
your blood sausage soup there.

335
00:19:31.438 --> 00:19:33.979
That'd be great!
Let's go upstairs.

336
00:19:33.979 --> 00:19:35.305
- Sure, let's go.
- Let's go.

337
00:19:36.158 --> 00:19:39.024
So this is why our Restaurant Row
had no customers.

338
00:19:39.224 --> 00:19:43.301
I think this entire building is being run
like a Jung Family food court.

339
00:19:50.464 --> 00:19:53.216
There aren't any customers near
Restaurant Row.

340
00:19:53.216 --> 00:19:56.707
We'll be able to establish ourselves here
faster than other Jung Family locations.

341
00:20:00.256 --> 00:20:02.158
What brings you here?

342
00:20:02.158 --> 00:20:04.955
I doubt you came here to eat.

343
00:20:04.955 --> 00:20:06.698
I just came by to look around.

344
00:20:06.698 --> 00:20:08.170
Did you come to spy on us?

345
00:20:09.242 --> 00:20:11.284
Do you think you're capable
of copying us, though?

346
00:20:11.284 --> 00:20:13.345
Not just any person
can be a businessman.

347
00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:16.034
And you don't succeed just by
working hard at it.

348
00:20:16.034 --> 00:20:17.909
So don't overextend yourself any further

349
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:20.469
and take the chance now to quit.

350
00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:22.281
I will still see this through
until the very end.

351
00:20:22.281 --> 00:20:25.494
One won't learn much unless
they see things through to the end.

352
00:20:25.494 --> 00:20:27.823
That's a common mistake
among young folks.

353
00:20:27.823 --> 00:20:32.073
They end up losing ten things
by trying to learn one thing.

354
00:20:46.844 --> 00:20:48.534
That was a great idea.

355
00:20:48.534 --> 00:20:50.296
When did you manage
to come up with that?

356
00:20:50.296 --> 00:20:52.235
Just... you know.

357
00:20:52.235 --> 00:20:54.105
Keep working hard.

358
00:20:54.105 --> 00:20:57.765
If things go well, I'll appoint you
as the General Director of this building.

359
00:20:57.765 --> 00:21:00.533
Yes, CEO Jung!
Thank you!

360
00:21:00.533 --> 00:21:01.803
CEO Jung?

361
00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.543
Chairman Oh's wife
is here to see you.

362
00:21:06.506 --> 00:21:08.160
What brings you here?

363
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.734
Where is Jin Kyu?

364
00:21:09.734 --> 00:21:13.737
I asked the other employees, and
they said that you fired him!

365
00:21:13.737 --> 00:21:15.022
Well, ask again, then.

366
00:21:15.022 --> 00:21:17.431
I never fired Jin Kyu.

367
00:21:17.431 --> 00:21:20.898
I prepared a ceremony for him to
be appointed as a director

368
00:21:20.898 --> 00:21:23.669
but he suddenly disappeared
that morning.

369
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:25.054
What do you mean, he disappeared?

370
00:21:25.054 --> 00:21:26.666
Why would he?

371
00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:30.858
He said that he has no intention of
living his life as an Ohsung Group heir.

372
00:21:30.858 --> 00:21:32.198
What do you mean by that?

373
00:21:32.198 --> 00:21:34.026
I told him the truth

374
00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:36.637
and said that Chairman Oh would
accept him as his son again

375
00:21:36.637 --> 00:21:38.860
if he became a successful businessman.

376
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.304
And to accept the director
position, and to work hard.

377
00:21:42.304 --> 00:21:44.302
But he said he didn't want that.

378
00:21:44.302 --> 00:21:51.602
He said that he has no intention of ever
being the chairman's second eldest son.

379
00:21:52.754 --> 00:21:56.072
Where on earth is he now, then?

380
00:21:56.072 --> 00:21:58.109
I don't know, either.

381
00:21:58.109 --> 00:22:00.361
I'm doing all I can to
search for him right now, too.

382
00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:02.246
Oh... goodness!

383
00:22:05.023 --> 00:22:06.584
<i>Thanks for everything.</i>

384
00:22:06.584 --> 00:22:09.180
<i>But don't keep a wretched guy
like me in your company.</i>

385
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.158
<i>You know that ugly dolls look uglier
when you put them together, right?</i>

386
00:22:13.158 --> 00:22:14.854
<i>Good luck.</i>

387
00:22:14.854 --> 00:22:17.940
So, you didn't have a single
customer come in today?

388
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.480
All we had were the 20
delivery orders that came in.

389
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.275
This isn't even enough
for us to break even.

390
00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:26.265
Goodness, and our contract
will be up soon.

391
00:22:26.265 --> 00:22:28.043
So we'll have to pay higher rent.

392
00:22:28.043 --> 00:22:30.060
And Youngil Bank is telling us
that our loans are due

393
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.608
and that we need to repay
them immediately.

394
00:22:32.608 --> 00:22:34.624
You have to pay back your
loans now, too?

395
00:22:34.624 --> 00:22:38.438
Don't they usually give you an extension
if you pay off the interest consistently?

396
00:22:38.438 --> 00:22:39.477
Yeah.

397
00:22:39.477 --> 00:22:41.666
But this time they said no.

398
00:22:41.666 --> 00:22:44.458
They flat-out refused!

399
00:22:44.458 --> 00:22:46.249
Our loans aren't the only problem.

400
00:22:46.249 --> 00:22:49.158
The building owners are saying that
they'll raise rent by 50 percent.

401
00:22:49.158 --> 00:22:50.627
50 percent?

402
00:22:50.627 --> 00:22:53.881
But the law says they can only
raise it up nine percent!

403
00:22:53.881 --> 00:22:55.853
Oh, the law doesn't matter here.

404
00:22:55.853 --> 00:23:00.556
Here, we have to pay whatever they
ask for and sign a contract, too.

405
00:23:00.556 --> 00:23:04.561
If we don't, then the building owners
refuse to rent to us.

406
00:23:16.609 --> 00:23:19.477
They can't just ignore the law like this
just because they're the building owners!

407
00:23:19.477 --> 00:23:21.925
It's because they're more
powerful than the law.

408
00:23:22.473 --> 00:23:25.268
You know the saying, "Building owners
are more powerful than God Almighty."

409
00:23:27.065 --> 00:23:29.217
That's just how South Korean laws are.

410
00:23:29.217 --> 00:23:31.815
We never protect the poor.

411
00:23:31.815 --> 00:23:34.566
They just act like they are,
and then drop the act soon enough.

412
00:23:34.566 --> 00:23:36.601
But we can't just stand around
and let them do this to us.

413
00:23:36.601 --> 00:23:37.651
What's your plan, then?

414
00:23:37.651 --> 00:23:38.867
We'll have to find a way.

415
00:23:40.486 --> 00:23:41.861
Let's do this, then.

416
00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:43.294
Do what?

417
00:23:43.294 --> 00:23:46.893
Who do you think you are,
asking us to get together like this?

418
00:23:46.893 --> 00:23:50.718
I told you. We have something to say
on behalf of your tenants.

419
00:23:51.871 --> 00:23:54.458
Don't raise the rent this year.

420
00:23:54.458 --> 00:23:56.060
- What did you say?
- What?

421
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.888
- What is she saying?
- What is this nonsense?

422
00:23:57.888 --> 00:23:59.463
If you raise the rent
this year as well

423
00:23:59.463 --> 00:24:01.631
we'll report the fact that you forced
a contract on your tenants

424
00:24:01.631 --> 00:24:03.832
and all of your tax evasion
to the authorities.

425
00:24:03.832 --> 00:24:05.367
- What?
- Why, you little...

426
00:24:05.367 --> 00:24:07.823
Are you punks blackmailing us right now?

427
00:24:07.823 --> 00:24:11.373
Yes, just like you've been
blackmailing your tenants all along.

428
00:24:11.373 --> 00:24:14.701
- What the...
- What are you trying to pull, here?

429
00:24:14.701 --> 00:24:16.034
I'm asking for us to coexist!

430
00:24:16.034 --> 00:24:17.589
If all of the restaurants on
Restaurant Row go down

431
00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:19.678
all of you will go down
alongside them.

432
00:24:20.572 --> 00:24:23.716
What tenant would want to start a
business in an unsuccessful area?

433
00:24:26.556 --> 00:24:28.214
This is a tough time for everyone.

434
00:24:28.214 --> 00:24:31.371
So if we fight amongst each other,
all of us will go down together.

435
00:24:32.862 --> 00:24:36.085
Looks like these young folks
have us trapped.

436
00:24:37.707 --> 00:24:39.518
Jeez.

437
00:24:39.518 --> 00:24:44.208
Damn it, what's got them so busy
that they can't even eat with us?

438
00:24:44.208 --> 00:24:46.617
I hate eating alone with that guy.

439
00:24:46.617 --> 00:24:48.349
They said that they had
an urgent meeting!

440
00:24:48.349 --> 00:24:51.621
Damn it, how annoying.

441
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:54.105
When you're annoyed,
eat some jjajangmyun!

442
00:24:54.105 --> 00:24:56.132
And when you're sad, eat some ulmyeon!

443
00:24:56.132 --> 00:24:58.437
When things are chaotic,
eat some fried rice!

444
00:24:58.437 --> 00:25:00.756
Tang, tang, tang, tang!

445
00:25:00.756 --> 00:25:04.637
Here.
Eat up.

446
00:25:06.632 --> 00:25:07.900
I put my heart into this.

447
00:25:09.805 --> 00:25:12.022
I honestly feel like I'm going to cry.

448
00:25:12.022 --> 00:25:13.171
Soon Ae!

449
00:25:13.171 --> 00:25:15.778
Don't you know that I don't eat peas?

450
00:25:15.778 --> 00:25:18.225
Do you not have a brain?

451
00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:20.131
How many damn times
do I have to tell you this?

452
00:25:42.622 --> 00:25:44.438
Nobody is allowed here after 10 p.m.

453
00:25:54.858 --> 00:25:56.209
Mr. Jin Kyu!

454
00:25:56.209 --> 00:25:57.486
Oh!

455
00:25:57.486 --> 00:25:59.123
Oh, Ji Yoon.
Oh.

456
00:25:59.123 --> 00:26:00.746
Wow, so this really works, huh?

457
00:26:00.746 --> 00:26:03.708
I sent you a telepathic message
telling you to meet me here.

458
00:26:05.228 --> 00:26:08.198
I didn't know that our minds
were so well-linked like this.

459
00:26:08.198 --> 00:26:10.536
Oh, um, yeah.
Totally.

460
00:26:12.958 --> 00:26:16.256
But, um, Ji Yoon.
I'll head back to your place first.

461
00:26:16.256 --> 00:26:19.309
- What?
- I'll turn the lights on and such.

462
00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:21.102
- Take your time walking home.
- Let's just go together.

463
00:26:21.102 --> 00:26:22.302
No, no.
Take your time.

464
00:26:22.302 --> 00:26:23.802
Take your time!

465
00:26:24.504 --> 00:26:25.719
What's with him?

466
00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:27.791
Whew!

467
00:26:41.919 --> 00:26:45.938
Oh well, whatever.

468
00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:47.893
You sure were good at
blackmailing them.

469
00:26:47.893 --> 00:26:49.511
I learned it all from you.

470
00:26:50.665 --> 00:26:52.105
Make sure you learn this kind of stuff.

471
00:26:52.105 --> 00:26:55.850
You can't just be nice if you're going to
run a business in this kind of country.

472
00:26:57.727 --> 00:26:59.268
You're the CEO, after all.

473
00:26:59.268 --> 00:27:01.136
So you take care of the dirty work

474
00:27:01.136 --> 00:27:04.720
and let your workers
live their lives as kind people.

475
00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.585
Seeing you act like this really makes you
seem like the chairwoman.

476
00:27:06.585 --> 00:27:09.916
I'll fire you as the CEO
if you don't do as I say.

477
00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:11.698
Oh, wow!

478
00:27:12.158 --> 00:27:15.455
Doesn't it feel like we're newlyweds
since we're acting like this?

479
00:27:15.455 --> 00:27:16.640
What?

480
00:27:17.492 --> 00:27:19.938
And what do newlyweds do
at a time like this...

481
00:27:26.485 --> 00:27:28.916
Ow!
Ow!

482
00:27:28.916 --> 00:27:30.421
Whoa, ow!

483
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:32.708
Did that hurt?

484
00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:41.330
Hey!

485
00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:46.881
Hyun Soo is here right now?

486
00:27:46.881 --> 00:27:49.727
Yeah. He said that he wants to
work at our company, too.

487
00:27:49.727 --> 00:27:52.438
Are... you okay?

488
00:27:55.604 --> 00:27:58.041
Go home.
You've worked hard today.

489
00:27:58.989 --> 00:28:01.650
Okay, I'll be going.

490
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.573
Sweet dreams.
I'll see you tomorrow.

491
00:28:03.573 --> 00:28:04.603
Okay.

492
00:28:07.056 --> 00:28:08.833
- Get home safely.
- Okay.

00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:34.938
Oh... hey, you!

495
00:28:34.938 --> 00:28:36.294
Let's play together.

496
00:28:42.684 --> 00:28:45.205
- Dan Ah.
- What are you doing?

497
00:28:45.205 --> 00:28:47.136
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

498
00:28:47.136 --> 00:28:48.669
I thought you said you were
secretly giving lessons.

499
00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:50.958
So where on earth are you
going right now?

500
00:28:51.305 --> 00:28:54.310
Ah, I decided to take a break today.

501
00:28:55.572 --> 00:28:56.805
I have a cold.

502
00:28:56.805 --> 00:28:59.575
Then you should go home.
Why are you out in a place like this?

503
00:28:59.575 --> 00:29:00.870
"A place like this"?

504
00:29:02.065 --> 00:29:04.806
Are you talking about this bar?

505
00:29:05.427 --> 00:29:06.474
Yes.

506
00:29:06.897 --> 00:29:07.957
Yeon Ji.

507
00:29:08.967 --> 00:29:11.545
Min Chan. You're here already?

508
00:29:11.545 --> 00:29:12.573
Yes.

509
00:29:12.573 --> 00:29:15.104
Oh, Dan Ah. Hello.

510
00:29:15.532 --> 00:29:18.276
I was with you earlier.

511
00:29:18.276 --> 00:29:19.556
What are you two up to?

512
00:29:19.556 --> 00:29:22.845
Oh, we were just going to have a drink.

513
00:29:22.845 --> 00:29:23.956
What?

514
00:29:24.765 --> 00:29:26.344
You're the only one who can date?

515
00:29:27.034 --> 00:29:28.367
D... date?

516
00:29:31.246 --> 00:29:33.406
- Hey, then every night...
- That's right.

517
00:29:34.927 --> 00:29:37.795
Things were kind of hot between us.

518
00:29:37.795 --> 00:29:39.050
Is that so wrong?

519
00:29:40.658 --> 00:29:42.127
Let's go, Min Chan.

520
00:29:42.127 --> 00:29:43.316
Oh, okay.

521
00:29:46.188 --> 00:29:47.965
What? Are you serious?

522
00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.511
How shocking.

524
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.835
Go on and eat. This is just for you.

525
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.534
Look at you letting your older bro
eat first.

526
00:30:18.313 --> 00:30:22.544
You're the only person who truly
coaches me, Ho Young.

527
00:30:25.599 --> 00:30:29.129
Every time the others open their mouths,
they tell me to give up, it's hopeless...

528
00:30:29.129 --> 00:30:31.964
It won't work. Those hateful jerks.

529
00:30:33.716 --> 00:30:34.977
Eat up.

530
00:30:34.977 --> 00:30:36.275
Thanks for the food.

531
00:30:38.677 --> 00:30:41.167
I'll only trust in you.

532
00:30:41.167 --> 00:30:44.701
Please help Yeon Ji become my woman.

533
00:30:48.512 --> 00:30:50.105
All right. Thank you.

534
00:30:54.762 --> 00:30:56.811
Wow, I almost got in big trouble.

535
00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.128
If I wasn't planning to meet you
today, Min Chan...

536
00:31:00.128 --> 00:31:01.746
there would've been complete chaos.

537
00:31:01.776 --> 00:31:04.136
She will find out someday, though.

538
00:31:04.705 --> 00:31:06.680
I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

539
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.257
Let's just drink for now.

540
00:31:09.257 --> 00:31:10.486
Here. Cheers.

541
00:31:27.477 --> 00:31:28.609
Here you go.

542
00:31:30.102 --> 00:31:31.277
Hurry.

543
00:31:47.046 --> 00:31:49.686
Let's guard the things we should.

544
00:31:49.985 --> 00:31:52.794
Let's take care of one another and
take things slowly.

545
00:31:52.794 --> 00:31:53.887
Sure, okay.

546
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:56.742
Let’s make sure to do that.

547
00:31:57.562 --> 00:31:59.042
I'll turn off the lights then.

548
00:32:03.113 --> 00:32:04.199
Good night.

549
00:32:20.547 --> 00:32:21.614
Boom.

550
00:32:26.063 --> 00:32:28.873
Don't do that. It's not funny.

551
00:32:29.131 --> 00:32:30.396
I'm telling you, it's not funny.

552
00:32:30.396 --> 00:32:31.977
Okay. Go to bed.

553
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:34.957
- I promise not to.
- Don't promise. Just sleep.

554
00:32:34.958 --> 00:32:36.369
Okay. Go to sleep.

555
00:32:48.335 --> 00:32:49.374
Jump.

556
00:32:53.148 --> 00:32:54.638
Stop that!

557
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.146
- Okay.
- It's not funny.

558
00:32:57.147 --> 00:32:58.665
Sleep. I won't do it.

559
00:32:58.665 --> 00:33:01.139
Seriously, stop it. I'm not joking.

560
00:33:01.139 --> 00:33:02.287
I promise.

561
00:33:08.784 --> 00:33:09.882
Zoom.

562
00:33:09.882 --> 00:33:11.704
Don't say zoom.

563
00:33:11.704 --> 00:33:13.283
Don't zoom.

564
00:33:13.283 --> 00:33:15.602
I didn't do anything.

565
00:33:16.553 --> 00:33:19.822
You did a zoom. Something came flying.

566
00:33:19.822 --> 00:33:20.898
I really didn't.

567
00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:24.088
You keep denying it...

568
00:33:26.996 --> 00:33:28.196
Good night.

569
00:33:29.015 --> 00:33:31.179
How can I sleep, huh?

570
00:33:31.448 --> 00:33:34.016
How can I sleep when things come
flying at me?

571
00:33:40.887 --> 00:33:42.158
Let's go shopping.

572
00:33:44.236 --> 00:33:45.476
Go alone.

573
00:33:46.351 --> 00:33:48.921
I couldn't sleep at all.

574
00:33:48.922 --> 00:33:51.165
No, I won't get discounts if I go alone.

575
00:33:51.508 --> 00:33:53.507
No, leave me alone.

576
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:57.900
Oh, seriously.

577
00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.334
Save me.

578
00:33:59.841 --> 00:34:01.744
Stop it, you psycho.

579
00:34:02.066 --> 00:34:03.477
You're so heavy.

580
00:34:03.477 --> 00:34:05.714
- You psycho.
- Just walk!

581
00:34:09.298 --> 00:34:10.689
Welcome.

582
00:34:10.689 --> 00:34:13.008
Oh my. You two look so good together.

583
00:34:13.008 --> 00:34:14.316
Please don't lie.

584
00:34:14.934 --> 00:34:17.218
No, no. Thank you.

585
00:34:18.976 --> 00:34:21.628
Oh, this is perfect for two people.

586
00:34:21.628 --> 00:34:24.309
I'll cook. Honey, you do the laundry.

587
00:34:24.309 --> 00:34:26.557
I'll do both.
Just don't bother me at night.

588
00:34:27.668 --> 00:34:31.298
Then you shouldn't bother me during
the day especially when I do the dishes.

589
00:34:33.597 --> 00:34:34.791
Stop that.

590
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:37.789
I guess day or night doesn't matter
for you two.

591
00:34:37.789 --> 00:34:38.970
You're right.

592
00:34:39.255 --> 00:34:40.483
Let's go look at other stuff.

593
00:34:40.963 --> 00:34:42.816
Enjoy your meal.

594
00:34:42.816 --> 00:34:44.726
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

595
00:34:46.108 --> 00:34:49.497
Here you go. Enjoy your meal.

596
00:34:49.497 --> 00:34:50.939
Thank you.

597
00:34:51.535 --> 00:34:53.438
Here you go. Enjoy your meal.

598
00:34:53.438 --> 00:34:54.758
Thank you.

599
00:34:54.758 --> 00:34:57.180
- Hello.
- Oh, CEO Choi!

600
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.593
Oh, hold on.

601
00:34:59.593 --> 00:35:01.800
Manger Kim, help out here.

602
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.918
Put your hat on properly. Thanks.

603
00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:08.139
What brings you here?

604
00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:11.229
Can I help you with anything?

605
00:35:11.229 --> 00:35:14.441
I'd appreciate your help, of course.

606
00:35:14.441 --> 00:35:16.653
Please help us distribute food.

607
00:35:16.653 --> 00:35:17.847
Sure.

608
00:35:18.709 --> 00:35:19.992
Thank you for your hard work.

609
00:35:23.959 --> 00:35:28.240
You're even helping me clean up too.

610
00:35:29.439 --> 00:35:31.320
You must have a favor to ask of me.

611
00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.380
Yes.

612
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.952
- Is it a loan?
- Yes.

613
00:35:33.952 --> 00:35:37.271
But, it's not for me.
It's for our affiliate restaurants.

614
00:35:37.273 --> 00:35:39.064
Ah, I see.

615
00:35:40.106 --> 00:35:44.195
I heard they're having a hard
time lately.

616
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:49.010
Aren't loans meant for people
going through hard times?

617
00:35:50.019 --> 00:35:53.151
Yes, of course!
You came to the right person.

618
00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:55.505
Who should you get loans from?
Na Han Tae.

619
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:01.108
- Thank you.
- Oh, no.

620
00:36:03.887 --> 00:36:08.160
The vitality of the restaurants...

621
00:36:09.269 --> 00:36:10.863
on our street...

622
00:36:15.595 --> 00:36:19.026
I met him while delivering seolleongtang.

623
00:36:19.026 --> 00:36:21.369
He has agreed to cover all the loans.

624
00:36:21.369 --> 00:36:22.622
What are you making right now?

625
00:36:22.622 --> 00:36:26.535
He needs a business plan in order to
convince management.

626
00:36:26.535 --> 00:36:30.213
Something to show the vision that
this street has.

627
00:36:40.193 --> 00:36:42.383
CEO Choi, have you not learned Word?

628
00:36:42.383 --> 00:36:44.083
Huh? Well... no.

629
00:36:44.403 --> 00:36:46.584
I never needed to use a computer.

630
00:36:52.164 --> 00:36:55.925
Don't worry. It's only about ten pages.

631
00:36:55.925 --> 00:36:56.992
I can stay up all night.

632
00:36:56.992 --> 00:36:58.226
Oh my God.

633
00:36:59.673 --> 00:37:01.726
- Get up, Boss.
- Huh?

634
00:37:01.726 --> 00:37:03.941
Get your female employee to do it,
please.

635
00:37:10.418 --> 00:37:11.593
Water.

636
00:37:11.593 --> 00:37:12.845
Yes, water.

637
00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:17.001
Water.

638
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.892
- Coffee.
- Coffee, coffee.

639
00:37:24.376 --> 00:37:25.523
Coffee.

640
00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:30.628
Something sweet.

641
00:37:30.628 --> 00:37:31.950
Sweet? Something sweet.

642
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.079
Something sweet, what?

643
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:42.579
Here.

644
00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:52.003
- Is it good?
- Yes.

645
00:37:58.083 --> 00:38:00.981
This should have an outline around it
to emphasize it.

646
00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:04.057
- Like this?
- Yes.

647
00:38:04.597 --> 00:38:07.146
Also, I want the titles to be bigger
and bolder.

648
00:38:07.146 --> 00:38:09.876
Yes, I was going to do that anyway.

649
00:38:09.876 --> 00:38:12.057
I think we can take this out.

650
00:38:12.057 --> 00:38:13.126
Which part?

651
00:38:13.927 --> 00:38:17.186
From here to there.

652
00:38:17.186 --> 00:38:18.376
From here...

653
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.407
Get away from me!

654
00:38:42.934 --> 00:38:43.981
I'll get going now.

655
00:38:43.981 --> 00:38:45.972
- Should I take you home?
- Forget it.

656
00:38:46.637 --> 00:38:47.780
Bye!

657
00:38:54.934 --> 00:38:56.108
What are you doing?

658
00:38:56.108 --> 00:38:57.639
I'm taking you home.

659
00:39:00.778 --> 00:39:02.695
- Wait for me!
- Go back.

660
00:39:02.695 --> 00:39:04.334
That punk. Look at him.

661
00:39:04.334 --> 00:39:06.184
Kang Soo looks really happy.

662
00:39:06.184 --> 00:39:08.405
I thought the three of us
could finally have a drink.

663
00:39:08.885 --> 00:39:10.296
I know.

664
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.322
Did you get a lot of exercise, CEO Choi?

665
00:39:25.083 --> 00:39:26.941
Thank you for bringing me home.

666
00:39:26.941 --> 00:39:28.979
Hey, get me some water.

667
00:39:28.979 --> 00:39:30.579
Go to Lively Handmade Noodles and
have some.

668
00:39:30.579 --> 00:39:31.682
Hey!

669
00:39:31.682 --> 00:39:32.840
Hurry up.

670
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.030
I'm holding all the heavy stuff.

671
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.945
Who told you
to lose rock, paper, scissors?

672
00:39:36.945 --> 00:39:39.503
You made me do it until you won!

673
00:39:39.503 --> 00:39:40.650
Oh Jin Kyu.

674
00:39:42.358 --> 00:39:43.474
What is it?

675
00:39:56.646 --> 00:39:58.215
How did you end up with Ji Yoon?

676
00:39:59.744 --> 00:40:02.253
Don't ask me. I'm suffering.

677
00:40:03.182 --> 00:40:04.892
Where have you been all this time?

678
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.510
Just here and there.

679
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.892
What happened to you? Tell me.

680
00:40:09.894 --> 00:40:11.231
It just worked out that way.

681
00:40:12.383 --> 00:40:14.110
How about your business?
Is it doing well?

682
00:40:14.392 --> 00:40:15.505
It's hard.

683
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.950
It was better when we were going at it
with each other.

684
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.664
Honestly, we're being pushed out and
we're in danger.

685
00:40:21.664 --> 00:40:23.713
- Hold on for just six months.
- What?

686
00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:25.983
Jung Family won't continue
selling at those low prices.

687
00:40:25.983 --> 00:40:30.191
Once the competitors close and leave,
they'll raise their prices.

688
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:34.119
The seolleongtang that costs 5,500 won
now will go up to 8,000 won.

689
00:40:34.119 --> 00:40:35.189
Really?

690
00:40:35.189 --> 00:40:39.108
I checked all the other Jung Family
businesses and they all do that.

691
00:40:39.108 --> 00:40:43.601
If another restaurant happens to open up,
they’ll have a lunch special.

692
00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:46.160
They'll lower to 5,500 won again
and shut the other store down.

693
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.758
Even if the building is theirs...

694
00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:54.139
they can't continue
selling at that price.

695
00:40:54.139 --> 00:40:58.291
They may not pay rent,
but they pay a lot of bank interest.

696
00:40:58.291 --> 00:41:01.811
They take out a loan of nearly
10 billion won to start a business.

697
00:41:01.811 --> 00:41:03.249
Hold on for six months.

698
00:41:03.249 --> 00:41:06.610
If you hold on until then,
Jung Family will fall.

699
00:41:10.356 --> 00:41:12.075
You were set up on a marriage date?

700
00:41:12.075 --> 00:41:14.327
Yes, my family forced me to.

701
00:41:14.327 --> 00:41:16.438
You did it
even though you liked Kang Soo?

702
00:41:16.438 --> 00:41:18.017
I had no choice.

703
00:41:18.017 --> 00:41:21.336
They were going to force me on a plane
and send me to study abroad if I didn't.

704
00:41:21.767 --> 00:41:24.666
So, what's your relationship now?

705
00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.816
You don't live here with him, do you?

706
00:41:28.246 --> 00:41:29.267
I do.

707
00:41:30.035 --> 00:41:31.807
Don't get the wrong idea.

708
00:41:31.807 --> 00:41:33.706
We haven't crossed any lines.

709
00:41:33.706 --> 00:41:35.785
We keep a boundary when we sleep.

710
00:41:37.338 --> 00:41:42.206
Wow, are you really naive, or corrupt?

711
00:41:42.206 --> 00:41:44.619
I told you not to say that.

712
00:41:44.619 --> 00:41:46.548
Okay, all right.

713
00:41:46.929 --> 00:41:49.284
Keep your boundaries and live.
I'll be going.

714
00:41:49.285 --> 00:41:51.851
- I have a question to ask.
- What is it?

715
00:41:51.851 --> 00:41:54.476
Is Mister's company hiring anymore?

716
00:41:54.476 --> 00:41:56.282
What are you trying to say?

717
00:41:56.282 --> 00:42:00.130
If he is hiring,
I just want to recommend Jin Kyu.

718
00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:01.932
He is experienced, so he'll do well.

719
00:42:01.932 --> 00:42:03.479
We have no plans to.

720
00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:07.226
Then how about as an intern or part-time?

721
00:42:07.226 --> 00:42:09.497
It's hard if I'm the only one with
an income.

722
00:42:09.497 --> 00:42:10.838
We both need an income.

723
00:42:10.838 --> 00:42:13.552
- Wow.
- Please do me this favor.

724
00:42:38.476 --> 00:42:40.577
I'll pay you back,
so can you stop calling?

725
00:42:40.577 --> 00:42:42.907
Ah, language study abroad?

726
00:42:42.907 --> 00:42:45.206
- Of course, you should go.
- All right.

727
00:42:45.206 --> 00:42:47.247
No, no. Don't worry.
I'll do it for you.

728
00:42:48.952 --> 00:42:50.043
Okay.

729
00:42:52.273 --> 00:42:53.421
Your little sister?

730
00:42:54.793 --> 00:42:55.992
Credit card company?

731
00:42:56.293 --> 00:42:58.173
- How much do you need?
- 10 million won.

732
00:42:58.557 --> 00:43:00.275
- How about you?
- 8 million won.

733
00:43:00.999 --> 00:43:02.090
What are you going to do?

734
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.376
Of course we'll loan you the money.

735
00:43:04.376 --> 00:43:08.521
Who would we lend money to if not for
young people with bright futures?

736
00:43:08.521 --> 00:43:12.171
Of course, we should lend them a lot.

737
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:14.521
Let's go inside and sign the contract.

738
00:43:14.521 --> 00:43:15.684
This way.

739
00:43:17.543 --> 00:43:18.668
Hurry along.

740
00:43:19.646 --> 00:43:20.726
Come on.

741
00:43:27.066 --> 00:43:28.226
You're getting back now?

742
00:43:28.226 --> 00:43:29.349
Yeah.

743
00:43:32.749 --> 00:43:34.099
Did he drink?

744
00:43:34.099 --> 00:43:35.128
We had a drink.

745
00:43:35.128 --> 00:43:36.704
Why would you give him alcohol?

746
00:43:36.704 --> 00:43:38.083
He wanted to drink.

747
00:43:38.083 --> 00:43:40.646
Honestly, he hasn't been able to
drink for months.

748
00:43:40.646 --> 00:43:42.026
He must've craved it a lot.

749
00:43:43.175 --> 00:43:44.905
What are you going to do about Hyun Soo?

750
00:43:44.905 --> 00:43:46.726
Are you going to employ him or not?

751
00:43:46.726 --> 00:43:47.936
He should go home.

752
00:43:47.936 --> 00:43:50.005
Gosh, what's with you, seriously?

753
00:43:50.005 --> 00:43:51.351
He has to go home.

754
00:43:51.351 --> 00:43:52.534
Do whatever you want.

755
00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:54.003
I'm leaving.

756
00:43:55.434 --> 00:43:56.704
Get home safe.

757
00:44:55.465 --> 00:44:56.639
Hey, Boss.

758
00:44:59.459 --> 00:45:00.731
Boss.

759
00:45:02.601 --> 00:45:04.956
Yeah... you're here?

760
00:45:04.956 --> 00:45:07.246
Yes. Why are you sleeping here?

761
00:45:07.246 --> 00:45:09.758
I just fell asleep here.

762
00:45:10.188 --> 00:45:13.039
Is Hyun Soo sleeping alone in the room?

763
00:45:13.537 --> 00:45:14.597
Yes.

764
00:45:38.224 --> 00:45:40.628
Where is Hyun Soo?

765
00:45:45.675 --> 00:45:48.590
He's... on the second floor.

766
00:45:49.939 --> 00:45:52.380
Can you get him for me?

767
00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.793
Please leave.

768
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.220
I'll get Hyun Soo and leave.

769
00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:02.887
I told you to leave.

770
00:46:03.624 --> 00:46:04.758
Kang Soo.

771
00:46:12.351 --> 00:46:13.459
Mom.

772
00:46:15.392 --> 00:46:17.586
- Let's go.
- What's with you?

773
00:46:17.586 --> 00:46:19.771
I said I'm staying here with Kang Soo.

774
00:46:20.334 --> 00:46:21.613
Hurry up!

775
00:46:21.613 --> 00:46:23.514
Mom, why are you acting like this!

776
00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:25.564
Kang Soo, please stop my mom.

777
00:46:30.499 --> 00:46:31.843
Kang Soo!

778
00:46:31.843 --> 00:46:33.005
Go!

779
00:46:34.494 --> 00:46:35.570
Kang Soo...

780
00:46:35.898 --> 00:46:37.054
Go home.

781
00:46:39.374 --> 00:46:40.744
Don't come back to Seoul.

782
00:46:42.383 --> 00:46:43.613
Why are you being like this?

783
00:46:50.673 --> 00:46:53.423
Let's go. Hurry up and let's leave.

784
00:46:53.798 --> 00:46:55.378
I said hurry up!

785
00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:58.175
Hurry up and let's go.

786
00:47:49.999 --> 00:47:51.990
- Dan Ah.
- Yes?

787
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:56.291
Can you call up all our employees and
the owners of all the restaurants?

788
00:48:03.052 --> 00:48:07.092
We came to an agreement with the building
owners not to increase rent this year.

789
00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:10.481
We found a way to resolve the issue
of the expired loan agreements.

790
00:48:10.481 --> 00:48:14.166
A new bank in this neighborhood will
give loans at a lower interest.

791
00:48:16.459 --> 00:48:18.999
What's with all of your facial
expressions?

792
00:48:18.999 --> 00:48:21.541
The rent isn't going up and the loan
issue has been resolved.

793
00:48:21.541 --> 00:48:23.160
This is an amazing thing.

794
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.247
Because it was our CEO,
he was able to pull it off.

795
00:48:25.247 --> 00:48:28.755
What good is it to resolve that?
There are no customers.

796
00:48:28.755 --> 00:48:31.577
Yes, we need customers first.

797
00:48:31.577 --> 00:48:34.445
Even if our rent doesn't increase and
we have the loans

798
00:48:34.445 --> 00:48:36.577
what good would that do when we
don't have customers?

799
00:48:37.318 --> 00:48:40.528
Yes, I realize that,
so I've been thinking.

800
00:48:40.528 --> 00:48:43.677
We need to make food that customers
want like Jung Family does.

801
00:48:43.677 --> 00:48:46.668
We need to use 100 percent domestic
ingredients like Jung Family.

802
00:48:46.668 --> 00:48:48.349
We have to sell at an affordable price.

803
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:51.122
Don't you think we want to do that?

804
00:48:51.122 --> 00:48:53.972
We would have no profit,
and that's why we can't.

805
00:48:54.351 --> 00:48:58.921
I'll do what I can to get ingredients
directly from the suppliers.

806
00:48:58.921 --> 00:49:00.264
You think that's easy?

807
00:49:00.264 --> 00:49:04.532
Also, even if you manage to do that,
we need to pay rent every month.

808
00:49:04.532 --> 00:49:07.572
So, how can we sell as cheap as
Jung Family?

809
00:49:07.572 --> 00:49:11.461
Yes, I know it is hard...
but we must do it.

810
00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:15.599
Even if you make only 100 won off one
dish, that's what we must do now.

811
00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:18.769
If we hold on for six months,
Jung Family will fall.

812
00:49:18.769 --> 00:49:23.238
Just like you have your rent,
Jung Family has interest on financing.

813
00:49:23.238 --> 00:49:27.639
Jung Family can't last six months on
the low prices they're offering now.

814
00:49:31.778 --> 00:49:35.898
Getting chased out because we
don't have money...

815
00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:38.671
is something I really hate.

816
00:49:38.671 --> 00:49:44.311
I know you all must hate getting chased
out when you've been for 10 or 20 years.

817
00:49:44.668 --> 00:49:46.380
That's why I need you to hold on.

818
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.530
If we join hands and hold on...

819
00:49:50.412 --> 00:49:51.760
we can win.

820
00:49:52.171 --> 00:49:53.401
Kang Soo.

821
00:49:54.965 --> 00:49:56.233
Let's stop now.

822
00:49:56.722 --> 00:49:57.883
Sir.

823
00:49:57.883 --> 00:50:00.012
How can we last six months?

824
00:50:00.012 --> 00:50:03.193
Even one month is hard for people
like us.

825
00:50:03.854 --> 00:50:06.244
Yes, we know how you feel.

826
00:50:06.244 --> 00:50:08.282
I know what you're trying to say too.

827
00:50:08.282 --> 00:50:13.175
However, people who have nothing usually
have to accept it even while knowing.

828
00:50:13.175 --> 00:50:15.304
We don't accept it because we don't know.

829
00:50:15.644 --> 00:50:17.267
We know everything.

830
00:50:17.686 --> 00:50:20.798
We have to accept all of this because
there is no other way!

831
00:50:21.983 --> 00:50:23.084
I'm sorry.

832
00:50:23.613 --> 00:50:24.793
You worked hard.

833
00:50:25.454 --> 00:50:26.653
Sir.

834
00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:30.336
Wait, sir!

835
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.421
Hello, welcome.

836
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:52.086
I'd like to put up a restaurant for rent.

837
00:50:52.485 --> 00:50:54.856
<i>[For Lease]
Please get it rented quickly.</i>

838
00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:58.291
<i>I'm just losing out on rent.</i>

839
00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.445
<i>[There are no delivery orders.]</i>

840
00:51:20.818 --> 00:51:25.217
Please trust in me this once and
give it a try.

841
00:51:25.217 --> 00:51:27.697
I'll try to protect this street somehow.

842
00:51:28.258 --> 00:51:31.693
Can't you trust in me this once?

843
00:51:31.972 --> 00:51:34.354
I'm asking you, just this once.

844
00:51:34.354 --> 00:51:35.505
I'm sorry.

845
00:51:43.003 --> 00:51:45.258
Here. Take this.

846
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.566
Kang Soo.

847
00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:08.976
You should go.

848
00:52:14.258 --> 00:52:15.664
Get some rest.

849
00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:20.724
Go on.

850
00:53:32.336 --> 00:53:34.086
- Yeon Ji.
- Huh?

851
00:53:35.209 --> 00:53:37.525
- What?
- This place really won't do.

852
00:53:37.525 --> 00:53:40.285
What... do you mean by that?

853
00:53:40.285 --> 00:53:41.867
This country...

854
00:53:43.775 --> 00:53:48.146
It really... it really won't do.

855
00:53:48.146 --> 00:53:51.385
It won't change with just one
good person.

856
00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:55.476
One good person can't do it.

857
00:53:57.374 --> 00:54:00.066
What is it now? Did something happen?

858
00:54:00.595 --> 00:54:02.606
That's why you should leave?

859
00:54:03.242 --> 00:54:06.798
You always said so.
This place has no hope.

860
00:54:07.012 --> 00:54:08.731
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

861
00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.601
Just shut your eyes to everything
and leave.

862
00:54:18.601 --> 00:54:21.680
Forget your family, Train Guy, everything
and just leave.

863
00:54:24.081 --> 00:54:26.119
Don't worry about the people left behind.

864
00:54:26.729 --> 00:54:30.240
Everyone will figure out a way to live.

865
00:54:30.711 --> 00:54:33.514
A lot of people live without any hope.

866
00:54:34.055 --> 00:54:36.543
A lot of people live life having
given up already.

867
00:54:38.985 --> 00:54:42.414
Also, please study English already.

868
00:54:42.414 --> 00:54:44.860
Since you met him,
how many pages have you done?

869
00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:45.952
Open your book.

870
00:54:47.887 --> 00:54:49.077
Go on now.

871
00:55:32.492 --> 00:55:33.626
Dan Ah.

872
00:55:33.626 --> 00:55:35.055
Try again.

873
00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.555
Start again.

874
00:55:40.534 --> 00:55:45.064
I don't know about others,
but I can't stand to see you give up.

875
00:55:45.543 --> 00:55:49.113
I don't even want to imagine you living
life without hope.

876
00:55:50.416 --> 00:55:51.584
Dan Ah.

877
00:55:52.874 --> 00:55:54.505
I want to see it.

878
00:55:55.334 --> 00:55:57.155
Someone like you succeeding.

879
00:55:58.804 --> 00:56:02.595
So, show it to me.

880
00:56:04.854 --> 00:56:06.025
Do it...

881
00:56:08.572 --> 00:56:10.238
and make me happy.

882
00:56:14.347 --> 00:56:16.014
Then I won't leave.

883
00:56:18.968 --> 00:56:20.119
No...

884
00:56:22.108 --> 00:56:23.689
Make it so I won't leave.

885
00:56:25.767 --> 00:56:26.952
Dan Ah.

886
00:56:28.843 --> 00:56:30.182
I love you.

887
00:56:34.233 --> 00:56:35.876
I love you, Kang Soo.
