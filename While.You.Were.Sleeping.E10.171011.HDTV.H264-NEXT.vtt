(Episode 10)

2
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.540
- Tae Seob. - Yes!

3
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.511
Here, this is the last delivery of the day.

4
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:28.150
Okay, I'll be back in a bit.

5
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.400
What? Is that where those missing pieces of fried chicken end up?

6
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.441
All right, I shouldn't say anything.

7
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:57.511
Who do I think I am?

8
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.550
I don't even have any energy left.

9
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.570
What if you have a dream about your death?

10
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:25.100
I'll just have to change it.

11
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.040
It can be changed.

12
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:32.181
(Myungwon University, Candle event, March 28 at 8pm)

13
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:43.320
- Mamamoo! - Mamamoo!

14
00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:58.800
(Myungwon University, Candle event, March 28 at 8pm)

15
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.550
(Myungwon University)

16
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:25.130
Gosh.

17
00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:43.921
What are you guys doing?

18
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.721
I'm a dad too.

19
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:52.191
I cried so much when I heard about the kid losing his parents.

20
00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:55.261
But I didn't drive, you know.

21
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.630
All I did was sit in the passenger seat.

22
00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:00.400
I did not drive. I didn't kill them.

23
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.471
You did more than just sit in the passenger seat.

24
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:06.001
You handed the car keys to him and even told him how to avoid police.

25
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:07.711
Handing the keys to him is considered a crime?

26
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.671
Someone else would've given him the keys anyway.

27
00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:12.681
Even if I had stopped him, he would've driven that night.

28
00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:16.150
Let's be honest here. It's not like I grabbed him by the collar...

29
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.681
or hit him to coerce him into driving.

30
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:20.150
All I did was this.

31
00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:22.650
That and making a mere suggestion...

32
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.491
can't justify you treating me like a total criminal here!

33
00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:30.701
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

34
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.400
It wasn't a mere suggestion.

35
00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:35.931
Gosh, Ms. Son is so bullheaded.

36
00:03:35.931 --> 00:03:38.771
She should just listen to Mr. Park and drop the case.

37
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:41.040
I can't believe she summoned him again for questioning.

38
00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:44.040
By the way, why are you here?

39
00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:46.411
Did you decide whether he should be indicted?

40
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:48.451
Oh, I actually have a favor to ask of you.

41
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.620
I have to interview a victim. See you later.

42
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.650
See you.

43
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.921
Gosh, all right. What is it?

44
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:00.761
Something has come up for me in the evening.

45
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.461
Would you be able to cover my night duty today?

46
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.531
My goodness.

47
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.900
There's a curse that everyone here knows about.

48
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.840
Something bad happens whenever you cover anyone's shift.

49
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.840
See you.

50
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:14.640
I'll cover your weekend shift.

51
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.110
When I covered for someone in the past,

52
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.340
there was an explosion at a karaoke bar.

53
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.781
I'll cover your shift during the holidays.

54
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:22.011
A ton of people died. From autopsies to postmortem examinations,

55
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.921
there were so many things to report.

56
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:26.251
I ended up with a mountain of work for just covering someone's shift.

57
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:28.550
Then I'll set you up with a nice lady.

58
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.890
What?

59
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:33.790
You said it's today, right?

60
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:36.491
Yes.

61
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.330
Thanks in advance, Mr. Jung.

62
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.941
No problem.

63
00:04:58.581 --> 00:04:59.781
Hey!

64
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.150
Get him!

65
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.391
- Jae Chan! - Stay still.

66
00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:05.561
My gosh!

67
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:20.641
- You woke up? - I didn't sleep.

68
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.471
Aren't you hungry?

69
00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:23.940
There's a tent bar nearby.

70
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.750
Their stir-fried sundae is unbelievably good.

71
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:28.181
Shall we go eat it?

72
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.380
Actually, how about we patrol the area around Myungwon University?

73
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.050
Okay. Then let's go eat stir-fried sundae quickly...

74
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.520
and head over to Myungwon University.

75
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.730
I'll drive. Let's patrol the area first.

76
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.101
Oh, really? That's what I was saying.

77
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.201
Let's go on patrol first.

78
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.041
Hey, wait. Where are you going this late?

79
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.311
Mom, I might be back late tonight. Don't wait for me.

80
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:04.020
Where are you going? And why are you taking this?

81
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.920
I'm heading out to save someone whom I saw getting injured in my dream.

82
00:06:10.991 --> 00:06:13.791
Mom, promise me one thing.

83
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.601
If I can change what I saw in my dream this time...

84
00:06:19.531 --> 00:06:21.300
and save that person's life,

85
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.000
please reconsider me wanting to go back to work, okay?

86
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.050
(Cho Hee, accept my love!)

87
00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:46.791
- Say yes! - Say yes!

88
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.291
- Say yes! - Say yes!

89
00:06:53.701 --> 00:06:54.701
What is this?

90
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.170
What's going on?

91
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.070
- What just happened? - Who are you?

92
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:05.940
I'm so annoyed.

93
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.550
Cho Hee, Cho Hee!

94
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.181
Thank goodness.

95
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.130
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

96
00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:29.730
You won't believe me, but I just prevented a terrible accident.

97
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.270
What on earth are you talking about now?

98
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.440
Who is this woman?

99
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.971
Do you know how long it took us to prepare this?

100
00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:35.371
Do you know how much work went into this?

101
00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.210
- Do you have any idea? - What was that about?

102
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.281
- Hey! - Stop!

103
00:07:41.851 --> 00:07:43.750
- Hey. - Stop right there!

104
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.641
- Where did she go? - I think she went that way.

105
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:07.011
Which way did she go?

106
00:08:08.011 --> 00:08:09.610
Why are you here, Jae Chan?

107
00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:14.610
Let's go that way.

108
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.681
- All right. - Gosh.

109
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.320
- Goodness. - Hurry up.

110
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.400
- It's okay. - Gosh.

111
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:42.440
1, 2, 3, 4.

112
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.451
1, 2, 3, 4.

113
00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:50.121
1, 2, 3.

114
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.050
I saw a girl getting a severe burn at the candle event in my dream,

115
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.561
so I shot a fire extinguisher and saved her life.

116
00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:00.931
But I realized afterward that she's... My gosh.

117
00:09:01.031 --> 00:09:02.661
You know the girl at the cafe, right?

118
00:09:02.661 --> 00:09:04.831
It was her. What a coincidence, right?

119
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:08.431
Are you here because you saw me in your dream?

120
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:10.741
Woo Tak told me...

121
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.241
that you've been having a lot of dreams about me.

122
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.911
Why would that be? Are we like the opposite poles of magnets?

123
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:18.980
Are we attracted to each other for some inexplicable reason? Like fate?

124
00:09:23.621 --> 00:09:26.050
I'm sorry about that day, and I'm grateful.

125
00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:28.291
That day? When?

126
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:30.690
You took my side in front of my co-workers at the restaurant.

127
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:32.161
Oh, that.

128
00:09:32.291 --> 00:09:33.891
I wasn't really taking your side.

129
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:35.531
I was just telling the truth.

130
00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:38.161
Then I take it back.

131
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.070
By the way, have you made a decision?

132
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.641
Should the man who abetted driving under the influence be indicted?

133
00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:44.971
Or should he be just let go?

134
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.241
He should be indicted.

135
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.811
Why? He didn't drive.

136
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.480
Just because he handed over the car keys?

137
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.311
It's a crime because it's not a big deal.

138
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:57.320
Not giving him the keys would've been...

139
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.920
no big deal either.

140
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:01.721
Like how he abetted DUI with just a few words,

141
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.891
he could've also prevented all of it with just a few words.

142
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.090
He could've saved lives had he taken his action seriously.

143
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.061
He didn't do what's right knowing how easy it is, so it is a crime.

144
00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:14.201
What he did was so trivial, and that's what makes it a crime.

145
00:10:15.971 --> 00:10:17.101
You've changed.

146
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.610
Well, because of someone, I guess.

147
00:10:29.781 --> 00:10:31.380
- There she is. - Where?

148
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.590
She's so dead.

149
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.650
Let's teach her a lesson.

150
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.431
Excuse me. I'm Lieutenant Han Woo Tak from Sangku Division.

151
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:48.371
You just jaywalked...

152
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.440
and violated Article 10 Section 2 of the Road Traffic Act.

153
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.971
What are you talking about? We haven't even crossed the street.

154
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:55.570
We were waiting for the light to change.

155
00:10:56.471 --> 00:10:58.710
I heard everything, okay?

156
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.581
Who's the woman? You guys said that she's so dead.

157
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.681
You punks. You guys are off to beat up someone, aren't you?

158
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:05.681
No, not at all.

159
00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:09.190
Don't wander around like hyenas looking for rotten meat.

160
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.460
Beating people up is bad, okay?

161
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.531
- Come with me. Come on! - Why are you doing this?

162
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.730
What do you think you're doing? Follow me.

163
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.860
- Officer. - I said, follow me!

164
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.931
- Gosh! Just follow me, will you? - I'm sorry.

165
00:11:19.931 --> 00:11:21.831
- Officer. - For goodness' sake!

166
00:11:21.971 --> 00:11:23.000
- Come on. - We're really sorry.

167
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.670
- Officer! - That's not what happened.

168
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.811
What's wrong? Did you get hurt?

169
00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:32.041
No, I didn't. But there's a burning sensation, which is so weird.

170
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:33.451
What is wrong with me?

171
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.951
Hello?

172
00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:46.460
Dae Hee.

173
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.201
What... What happened?

174
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:55.900
- Hey. - Tell me.

175
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:59.241
Can you hear me?

176
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.770
Cho Hee, what should we do?

177
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.440
He's not waking up.

178
00:12:06.811 --> 00:12:10.351
Hey, this isn't really happening now, right?

179
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.020
What on earth happened?

180
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.190
- Gosh, wake up. - Please...

181
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.190
Why is his body so cold?

182
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.291
Wake up, please.

183
00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:24.431
It's me, Cho Hee. Please...

184
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:28.331
Gosh, I have to do this postmortem because I covered his shift.

185
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.440
The curse was proved right once again.

186
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.270
The younger brother wasn't wearing his seat belt.

187
00:12:33.511 --> 00:12:35.670
The shock caused a dent in his skull,

188
00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:37.281
and his neck broke.

189
00:12:37.281 --> 00:12:39.741
Goodness, why didn't he put on his seat belt?

190
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:41.581
Who knows?

191
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.650
- Please... - Please excuse us for a moment.

192
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.820
Bleeding seems minimal for the size of the accident.

193
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.360
Shall we start the autopsy?

194
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.690
No.

195
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.190
No, you can't do an autopsy.

196
00:12:56.561 --> 00:12:58.130
To find out the accurate cause of death...

197
00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.701
No, please don't.

198
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.601
I killed him.

199
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:03.701
He could've taken the bus, but I...

200
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:07.670
I drove. I killed him.

201
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.340
Let's forgo the autopsy since that's what the victim's family wants.

202
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.050
What should we do now?

203
00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:26.491
I'm home.

204
00:13:29.331 --> 00:13:32.360
Oh, my. Why did you buy so many crabs?

205
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:40.741
Mom.

206
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.811
I saved that person,

207
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.811
the girl I saw getting injured in my dream.

208
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.610
So, as you promised...

209
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.920
I never made any promise. You just assumed that I did.

210
00:13:57.161 --> 00:14:00.690
Mom, you know how much I love writing in my diary.

211
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.601
I couldn't even sleep for an hour during my probationary period,

212
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.261
but I still made sure to write in my diary every day.

213
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.300
I used to fill up a dozen pages with mean stuff about my seniors.

214
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.670
But these days, I only write six words.

215
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.340
"Today wasn't any different from yesterday."

216
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.480
I can even write them in advance. Tomorrow won't be different either.

217
00:14:23.781 --> 00:14:26.550
What I wrote in the entire last year...

218
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.351
is less than what I used to write for a day.

219
00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:30.320
What are you trying to say?

220
00:14:35.661 --> 00:14:38.360
Mom, I just want...

221
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.531
today to be a little bit better.

222
00:14:42.201 --> 00:14:44.770
I don't want to waste my life just because I fear my dreams.

223
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.170
So? Are you saying you will go back to work?

224
00:14:47.411 --> 00:14:49.241
After seeing yourself die as a reporter in your dream?

225
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.041
I won't die.

226
00:14:52.081 --> 00:14:54.351
I'll just change what I saw in that dream.

227
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.951
I've been able to change my dreams since meeting Jae Chan and Woo Tak.

228
00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.951
I mean, I did it today too. It actually gave me a revelation.

229
00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:05.391
"There's one thing I know for certain about life."

230
00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:06.621
What is that one thing?

231
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.791
The fact that nothing is set in stone in life.

232
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.670
So, you're not really asking for my permission.

233
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.630
You're basically notifying me.

234
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.311
No, I'm not.

235
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.471
I won't go back to work if you don't allow it.

236
00:15:45.101 --> 00:15:46.161
It's gone bad.

237
00:15:56.185 --> 00:15:59.417
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E10 While You Were Sleeping "Don't Trust Her"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

238
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:12.320
What is going on here?

239
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.561
I'm in charge of making breakfast.

240
00:16:15.031 --> 00:16:16.061
Am I good?

241
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.531
I'm an amazing cook.

242
00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:21.270
I'll grill mackerel for you when you visit home during your vacation.

243
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.800
I know how to grill mackerel to perfection.

244
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.500
So Yoon, it's a total lie! Ask him to switch to a video call!

245
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.170
Go away, will you? Get out.

246
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.340
- Fire! - Gosh.

247
00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:30.940
There's a fire here!

248
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.581
(Jae Chan's dreams, Hong Joo's dreams, My dreams)

249
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:42.721
Do you usually have breakfast here?

250
00:16:42.721 --> 00:16:43.860
Oh, what brings you here?

251
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.161
I made toast for myself, but it got totally burnt.

252
00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:48.630
I figured this would fill me up. What about you?

253
00:16:48.661 --> 00:16:50.300
My morning has been similar to yours.

254
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.661
Right, there's something I want to ask you.

255
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:54.070
What is it?

256
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.130
About the accident...

257
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.900
I thought it was so strange.

258
00:17:02.741 --> 00:17:05.241
You obviously saved my life,

259
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:06.781
but strangely enough,

260
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.581
I felt as if I was hit by the car and died in that moment.

261
00:17:11.851 --> 00:17:16.420
It felt... It felt unbelievably real.

262
00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.991
Has something like that ever happened to you?

263
00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:23.500
Feeling like you came back to life after a near-death experience.

264
00:17:25.261 --> 00:17:26.400
I've felt that too.

265
00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:28.630
Seriously? When?

266
00:17:29.371 --> 00:17:33.000
It was when I was very young. I fell into deep water,

267
00:17:33.641 --> 00:17:35.811
and someone saved my life.

268
00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:44.621
I survived thanks to that kid, but strangely enough,

269
00:17:46.181 --> 00:17:48.621
I felt as if I was sinking and drowning in water.

270
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.491
It felt so real.

271
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.630
I knew it.

272
00:17:55.391 --> 00:17:57.061
The kid who saved your life...

273
00:17:58.431 --> 00:17:59.800
Wasn't it Hong Joo?

274
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.800
What?

275
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.800
All right. Hear out my hypothesis, okay?

276
00:18:03.101 --> 00:18:05.601
I was incredibly grateful to you because of that very feeling.

277
00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.570
I thought, "I could've really died."

278
00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:10.710
"I want to make sure I can repay him for saving my life."

279
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:13.181
- That thought must be... - What?

280
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.980
what started those dreams.

281
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.581
The dreams where I can foresee the future of the one who saved my life.

282
00:18:19.581 --> 00:18:22.920
You keep seeing Hong Joo in your dreams, so she must be...

283
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.991
the one who saved your life.

284
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.931
What do you think?

285
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.690
That is complete nonsense.

286
00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.960
Why?

287
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.931
The kid who saved me was a boy. It wasn't Hong Joo.

288
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.130
Are you sure?

289
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.471
Yes, I'm sure.

290
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:40.110
I called him Chestnut. It was a boy who loved baseball.

291
00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:42.440
A strong, brave boy.

292
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:47.710
I'm home!

293
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.121
Mom, there's a sale going on at the department store.

294
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:52.820
Mom?

295
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.050
Mom, why...

296
00:19:04.661 --> 00:19:07.000
Can this still be categorized as compost?

297
00:19:08.831 --> 00:19:09.931
Wait, is that...

298
00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:13.670
Is that the mackerel I gave you guys?

299
00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.840
No, it's not. This is...

300
00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:20.451
Well, grilling fish is harder than I thought.

301
00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:21.880
Controlling the heat is tricky too.

302
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.451
Gosh. How about you guys come over every morning for breakfast?

303
00:19:26.451 --> 00:19:27.690
Gosh, no. It's okay.

304
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.020
Please. I'd like to ask a favor of you in return.

305
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.190
Well... About Hong Joo...

306
00:19:34.791 --> 00:19:37.130
You don't know why she decided to take a leave of absence, right?

307
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.531
She had a dream...

308
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.300
where she died as a reporter.

309
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.270
That's why I told her to leave her job immediately.

310
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:51.041
You know, right? Her dreams are quite special.

311
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.241
Yes, I know.

312
00:19:54.011 --> 00:19:57.681
That wench wants to return to work though.

313
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.050
I should've dissuaded her.

314
00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:09.891
I've decided to let her do it because I felt so bad for her.

315
00:20:11.331 --> 00:20:13.670
It was breaking my heart to watch her having to hold back...

316
00:20:14.201 --> 00:20:15.500
from what she wants to do.

317
00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:43.601
Anyway, what kind of food do you like?

318
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.331
Korean, Chinese, or Western cuisine. You name it.

319
00:20:46.331 --> 00:20:49.300
I've run a bunch of restaurants, all of which went under,

320
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.500
so I can make all kinds of food.

321
00:20:52.141 --> 00:20:53.670
All you need to do is tell me...

322
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.110
what you and your brother like.

323
00:20:56.241 --> 00:20:57.980
I'll make breakfast for you guys every day.

324
00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.840
For free. I won't charge you.

325
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.210
Gosh. Why are you offering to make us breakfast out of the blue?

326
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.721
Well, you know. I just want to express my gratitude.

327
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.891
I heard that you saved my daughter's life a few times.

328
00:21:09.451 --> 00:21:11.161
I want to repay you.

329
00:21:12.561 --> 00:21:13.761
And...

330
00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:16.491
just in case you end up helping her again.

331
00:21:19.831 --> 00:21:21.000
Just in case...

332
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.770
It shouldn't happen,

333
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.440
but if something like that happens,

334
00:21:27.411 --> 00:21:29.311
please keep Hong Joo safe.

335
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:03.011
Shall I go back to work or not?

336
00:22:05.011 --> 00:22:06.511
It wasn't because she didn't want to go back.

337
00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:10.820
She wanted to go back, but she was scared.

338
00:22:44.281 --> 00:22:46.020
Facial expressions can be deceiving.

339
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.721
I got this!

340
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.561
I got this!

341
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.761
I got this! I can totally do this!

342
00:22:57.601 --> 00:23:01.101
Sometimes, we can read someone's mood, thoughts,

343
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.241
and feelings from their facial expressions like an open book.

344
00:23:13.911 --> 00:23:14.951
Mom.

345
00:23:15.781 --> 00:23:18.851
Gosh, don't worry. I'm still on the bus. Yes.

346
00:23:19.351 --> 00:23:20.750
Don't you believe in your daughter?

347
00:23:21.721 --> 00:23:23.221
Okay, I heard you.

348
00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.561
I'm so excited. Yes!

349
00:23:26.561 --> 00:23:28.391
- But some people can use... - Okay.

350
00:23:28.391 --> 00:23:30.230
their facial expressions like a mask...

351
00:23:30.431 --> 00:23:32.601
that conceals their mood, thoughts, and feelings.

352
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.500
Nevertheless, there are flashing moments...

353
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.270
that collapse the border between such deception and truth.

354
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.471
No...

355
00:24:26.281 --> 00:24:28.090
The truth that no one could see.

356
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.400
The things that you didn't want anyone to find out.

357
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.641
There are brief moments when they're revealed to the world.

358
00:24:50.181 --> 00:24:53.581
Let's not close our eyes if we ever happen to face such moments.

359
00:25:14.031 --> 00:25:15.371
Don't pretend you didn't see it.

360
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.601
Don't avoid it.

361
00:25:18.371 --> 00:25:19.641
Face it squarely.

362
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.360
Gosh, look who's here.

363
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.791
Hello, I'm back.

364
00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:45.630
- It's been such a long time. - Welcome back, Hong Joo.

365
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.170
Welcome back!

366
00:25:47.831 --> 00:25:49.400
- It's been so long. - Indeed.

367
00:25:49.531 --> 00:25:50.840
- Hey. - Captain!

368
00:25:51.041 --> 00:25:52.300
I'm back.

369
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:53.610
How's your health?

370
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:54.641
Good to see you, Hong Joo.

371
00:25:54.641 --> 00:25:56.570
Oh, hey. It was your baby's birthday, right?

372
00:25:56.781 --> 00:25:59.181
Your eye makeup is smudged. Go check in the mirror.

373
00:26:02.181 --> 00:26:03.951
Du Hyun, I'm back.

374
00:26:04.181 --> 00:26:06.420
I put your uniform on the desk over there.

375
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.791
You sure are her supervisor. You got everything ready for her.

376
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:16.331
You're so two-faced.

377
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.900
Captain! What are you doing now?

378
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.170
- I'm bugging you. - Gosh.

379
00:26:20.431 --> 00:26:22.831
You're my supervisor. Shouldn't you be helping me?

380
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.541
What is this mess? For goodness' sake!

381
00:26:43.491 --> 00:26:46.261
We got a brand new design for the uniform.

382
00:26:46.991 --> 00:26:50.360
I was getting sick of purple. Try it on. Let's see if it suits you.

383
00:26:55.331 --> 00:26:57.741
Was crossing the street that hard for you?

384
00:26:58.241 --> 00:27:00.710
I know, right? Is it because I haven't been here in so long?

385
00:27:01.241 --> 00:27:03.340
Everything feels hard, and I'm nervous for no reason.

386
00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.181
Then what? Shall I walk you to the office?

387
00:27:06.681 --> 00:27:09.811
Why are you being like this? I'll get the wrong idea again.

388
00:27:10.011 --> 00:27:12.920
I'll cling onto you and ask you to take me to work every day.

389
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.451
I'll also pester you to protect me.

390
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:17.520
We can do that.

391
00:27:19.491 --> 00:27:20.491
Sorry?

392
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:22.791
Cling onto me, ask me to take you to work,

393
00:27:22.791 --> 00:27:25.831
and pester me to protect you. I'll try.

394
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.701
Well... I'll do it if it'll give you relief.

395
00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.610
Why are you doing this to me? You sound like you mean it.

396
00:27:41.351 --> 00:27:44.721
I do mean it. You don't believe me?

397
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.020
Is that why you're crying?

398
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.590
I'm crying because I believe you,

399
00:27:48.951 --> 00:27:50.690
because I feel relieved.

400
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.460
I wanted to hear that so much.

401
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.931
That's why I'm crying.

402
00:27:58.331 --> 00:28:00.971
Gosh, my makeup got all smudged.

403
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.770
Hey, stop. What are you...

404
00:28:06.041 --> 00:28:08.741
You said you'd keep me safe. You can't even do this for me?

405
00:28:22.391 --> 00:28:23.991
You're not avoiding me today.

406
00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:26.920
You don't like it?

407
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:29.451
I do.

408
00:29:31.121 --> 00:29:32.661
I like it a lot.

409
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:36.761
