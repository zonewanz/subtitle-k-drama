00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:16.066
A thriller about a religious cult, Save Me.

2
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.067
(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:18.535
(All organizations, locations, 
religions, and characters...)

4
00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:19.870
(in this drama are fictitious.)

5
00:00:20.137 --> 00:00:21.338
Are you ready?

6
00:00:21.872 --> 00:00:23.006
Let's go.

7
00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:26.109
- Sang Mi! 
- Don't let them fool you.

8
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.944
Sang Mi! You demon.

9
00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.147
How dare you steal Almighty's possession?

10
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.715
Sang Mi!

11
00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:32.783
Thank you.

12
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.087
They said they should let
 the cult leader have me...

13
00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:38.722
to find salvation.

14
00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:40.157
We don't even have evidence yet.

15
00:00:40.157 --> 00:00:41.725
Do you think the police
 will investigate it properly?

16
00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:43.960
Call her dad, and tell him to come.

17
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.763
I'll go back. I'll try to figure out a way.

18
00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:49.733
What happened? Why did she go back?

19
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.269
It is now time to stand
 together and pray with fire.

20
00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.571
She already knew things 
would turn out this way.

21
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:56.740
I'm going to do things my way now.

22
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.177
I need to see for myself 
what kind of place it is.

23
00:01:00.177 --> 00:01:01.778
After Spiritual Father's announcement,

24
00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:03.647
you'll receive training 
to become Spiritual Mother.

25
00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:05.482
Then you'll have a spiritual wedding.

26
00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.018
Everyone who is 
considered influential in Muji...

27
00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:10.120
is affiliated with that cult.

28
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.055
That's my son.

29
00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:15.392
Your son has such a pure soul.

30
00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:20.997
(Episode 11)

31
00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:40.016
Hello?

32
00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.918
Your dad wants to see you.

33
00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.920
Come to the nursing home.

34
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:46.289
(Muji Hangil Nursing Home)

35
00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.993
Thank you for coming all the way here.

36
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.531
Sang Hwan, you're here.

37
00:01:55.232 --> 00:01:56.800
That's my son.

38
00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:11.448
Your son has...

39
00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:13.950
such a pure soul.

40
00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.955
Say hello. He's the pastor of Guseonwon.

41
00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:21.825
Dad, that man...

42
00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.794
isn't a pastor. He's a cult leader.

43
00:02:24.794 --> 00:02:27.564
Stop. That's rude of you.

44
00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:31.001
I'm sorry. He's still immature.

45
00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:33.670
It's fine.

46
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.438
Your name is Sang Hwan, right?

47
00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.709
I'm just a cleric who spreads 
the word of salvation...

48
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.878
in this land.

49
00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:44.014
He said he would...

50
00:02:44.014 --> 00:02:47.884
take better care of your 
friend you told me about.

51
00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:50.654
As I hear, she's a girl with an illness...

52
00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:52.822
and a wounded heart.

53
00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:56.726
Your father also asked people at
 the welfare division to help her.

54
00:02:57.294 --> 00:02:58.862
Don't worry.

55
00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:01.631
Dad.

56
00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:03.867
You did the same thing three years ago.

57
00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:07.504
I asked you to help out
 my innocent friend...

58
00:03:07.504 --> 00:03:10.574
because he was about to go to 
jail for not having money or connections.

59
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.843
You turned away from him to be 
elected as the governor!

60
00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:15.645
What is it this time?

61
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.949
A provincial governor? A congressman?

62
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.884
- That's enough. 
- When I was little,

63
00:03:20.884 --> 00:03:23.019
you told me that someone 
like you who has power...

64
00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.956
should help the weak and the poor!

65
00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:29.292
That man locked up a girl who is young enough to be your daughter...

66
00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.595
to make a pass at her.

67
00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:34.864
Han Sang Hwan! Don't say such a thing when you don't know anything.

68
00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:37.400
Dad. Are you willing...

69
00:03:38.702 --> 00:03:40.904
to join hands with a cult leader now?

70
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:44.274
How could you stoop so low?

71
00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:45.875
You brat!

72
00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:50.313
Gosh, Pastor Baek. I'm sorry.

73
00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:53.617
My foolish son made a big mistake.

74
00:03:53.617 --> 00:03:55.418
I apologize on behalf of him.

75
00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:57.087
Don't worry.

76
00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.522
Sang Hwan.

77
00:04:00.457 --> 00:04:03.893
Almighty does not turn away from...

78
00:04:04.394 --> 00:04:06.763
the weak and the poor.

79
00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:10.500
That's why he entrusted me with Sang Mi.

80
00:04:10.734 --> 00:04:15.138
Please trust me, and believe in Almighty.

81
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.713
(I hope you'll get better soon, Baek Jung Ki)

82
00:04:32.622 --> 00:04:33.757
After all,

83
00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:37.327
you're all the same.

84
00:05:01.785 --> 00:05:03.620
It's fine, Brother Wan Deok.

85
00:05:10.026 --> 00:05:12.195
Is there something else you want to say to me?

86
00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:13.530
I'm warning you.

87
00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:16.533
If you do so much as lay a finger on my friend,

88
00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:20.170
I will make you regret it.

89
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.643
Do you like Sang Mi, Sang Hwan?

90
00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:29.412
What nonsense are you talking?

91
00:05:29.612 --> 00:05:32.382
I'm just talking about your feelings.

92
00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:36.553
Just like how you can't hide your feelings towards her,

93
00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:41.491
Almighty can't hide his affection towards her either.

94
00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.527
So please don't misunderstand us.

95
00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:49.499
We care about Sang Mi more than anyone.

96
00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:53.236
The problem is Sang Mi doesn't like...

97
00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:56.673
you or the Almighty you're referring to.

98
00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.449
I hope you'll calm down your anger and visit us.

99
00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.253
People these days only believe things they can see.

100
00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:32.609
Thank you.

101
00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:34.144
- Please get off. - Okay.

102
00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:36.179
Welcome.

103
00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:38.481
- Bless you. - Come on up.

104
00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.721
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

105
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:45.955
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

106
00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:47.157
Thank you.

107
00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.693
- Bless you. - Please take one.

108
00:06:57.267 --> 00:06:59.102
Visit us.

109
00:06:59.102 --> 00:07:02.872
People these days only believe things they can see.

110
00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:07.577
"Dear Spiritual Father,"

111
00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:13.817
"Hello, Spiritual Father, my spiritual husband."

112
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.087
"I'm Shim Hyo Seo, a second grade student..."

113
00:07:18.087 --> 00:07:19.656
"at Muji Elementary School."

114
00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:23.326
"During your sermon, you taught me..."

115
00:07:23.326 --> 00:07:28.531
"that paradise is only there if we're delighted at heart."

116
00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:33.403
"I am so happy when I see you, Spiritual Father."

117
00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:38.508
"That's why this place is the paradise for me."

118
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.482
"Dear Spiritual Father, I will work hard to keep my faith..."

119
00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:49.619
"because I want to become Spiritual Mother in the future."

120
00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:53.289
"I will pray hard to Almighty..."

121
00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:57.427
"so I can become Spiritual Mother."

122
00:07:57.427 --> 00:07:59.896
She's such a precious child of faith.

123
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.165
Yes.

124
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:07.136
However, there can't be anyone more precious...

125
00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:09.739
than Sang Mi, our soon-to-be Spiritual Mother.

126
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.442
Don't you agree, Spiritual Mother?

127
00:08:16.212 --> 00:08:17.647
I will save them.

128
00:08:19.115 --> 00:08:20.116
I'm sorry?

129
00:08:21.484 --> 00:08:22.552
I will...

130
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.588
save them all no matter what.

131
00:08:27.357 --> 00:08:30.527
That's right, Sang Mi. Becoming Spiritual Mother is...

132
00:08:30.727 --> 00:08:34.197
a sacred deed which will save...

133
00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:35.532
everyone here.

134

(The Boat of Salvation Will Save You.)

135

(Offertory)

136
00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:05.128
Please stand up.

137
00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:13.202
You are...

138
00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:17.974
getting closer to Almighty.

139
00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.208
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

140
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.781
Our dear Sister Park Bong Hee here...

141
00:09:25.615 --> 00:09:30.320
made a special offering to Almighty today...

142
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.488
for Spiritual Mother's sake.

143
00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.890
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

144
00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:36.960
Also, she is only...

145
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.229
a few steps away from getting promoted...

146
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.832
to an apostle.

147
00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:46.002
Let's bless her with a round of applause.

148
00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.339
I believe it. Our wishes will be fulfilled!

149
00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:50.807
I believe it.

150
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:00.083
You're right.

151
00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:16.165
(Guseonwon Main Building, Private Prayer Rooms)

152
00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:28.645
Today, we're finally here...

153
00:10:29.312 --> 00:10:31.147
for the proclamation ceremony...

154
00:10:31.447 --> 00:10:34.183
for welcoming our new spiritual mother.

155
00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.227
All right.

156
00:10:45.028 --> 00:10:48.631
Now, let's welcome Sang Mi, who has been chosen...

157
00:10:49.332 --> 00:10:50.700
as Spiritual Mother,

158
00:10:51.668 --> 00:10:52.902
with a big round of applause.

159
00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:27.837
Like pure white flowers,

160
00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:31.274
you will purify us from our dark...

161
00:11:31.908 --> 00:11:33.509
and filthy sins.

162
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.746
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

163
00:11:36.746 --> 00:11:38.815
- Our wishes will be fulfilled! - Our wishes will be fulfilled!

164
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.978
My dear sisters and brethren.

165
00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:14.016
When Almighty gives me his message,

166
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.154
Sang Mi and I will have a spiritual wedding...

167
00:12:19.455 --> 00:12:22.925
where we will become one.

168
00:12:22.925 --> 00:12:24.727
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - We believe it.

169
00:12:24.727 --> 00:12:27.663
- All of you will be purified... - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

170
00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:33.136
from your filthy sins. Do you all believe it?

171
00:12:33.136 --> 00:12:35.071
- We believe it! - We believe it!

172
00:12:35.071 --> 00:12:36.839
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - Our wishes will be fulfilled.

173
00:13:15.978 --> 00:13:17.713
You can go down now.

174
00:13:18.681 --> 00:13:19.816
Okay.

175
00:13:42.438 --> 00:13:43.606
Stay out of it.

176
00:13:44.307 --> 00:13:47.210
Weren't you locked up in the youth detention center three years ago?

177
00:13:48.544 --> 00:13:50.379
Who are you?

178
00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:37.894
(Spiritual Father's Office)

179
00:15:39.322 --> 00:15:42.024
(We bless and welcome you, Reception for new believers)

180
00:16:01.344 --> 00:16:02.845
Please have a seat.

181
00:16:07.516 --> 00:16:09.518
There are some things I need to talk to you about in preparation...

182
00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:12.221
for the upcoming spiritual wedding.

183
00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:14.991
Everyone, from myself and apostles...

184
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:17.159
to all of our believers,

185
00:16:17.526 --> 00:16:20.496
must abstain from eating meat from now on.

186
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.132
We can only eat...

187
00:16:23.866 --> 00:16:25.267
clean, raw white rice.

188
00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:27.536
We must purify our blood...

189
00:16:27.937 --> 00:16:30.840
before welcoming Spiritual Mother.

190
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.409
Do you all understand?

191
00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:36.078
- Yes, Spiritual Father. - Yes, Spiritual Father.

192
00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:38.247
I'll wait for Almighty's message...

193
00:16:38.948 --> 00:16:41.951
to reschedule the date for the wedding.

194
00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:46.288
So please make sure that you can be ready at all times.

195
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:49.658
You two apostles should make sure...

196
00:16:49.658 --> 00:16:53.929
that Sang Mi can be in her purest, cleanest state spiritually.

197
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.331
We'll make sure, Spiritual Father.

198
00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.900
Our wishes will be fulfilled. I believe it.

199
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.736
All right then. You may leave now.

200
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.051
Here are some things I think you should include in your next sermon.

201
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:17.920
Since we're welcoming Spiritual Mother,

202
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.688
it'd be nice if you could help me...

203
00:17:19.688 --> 00:17:22.558
map out what we can do to collect special offerings for the occasion.

204
00:17:23.159 --> 00:17:24.927
It's a very special event, you know.

205
00:17:25.528 --> 00:17:27.696
But we haven't collected as much as I was expecting.

206
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.668
Here.

207
00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:40.876
"Since we're welcoming Spiritual Mother,"

208
00:17:41.077 --> 00:17:44.346
"we must now get rid of all materialistic things..."

209
00:17:44.447 --> 00:17:47.116
"that blind us and weigh down our hearts..."

210
00:17:47.249 --> 00:17:49.452
"in order to get on the Boat of Salvation..."

211
00:17:49.452 --> 00:17:53.189
"with a light heart and clean soul."

212
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.226
Well, that's the gist of it.

213
00:17:57.426 --> 00:18:01.230
But we both know how good you are at editing sentences.

214
00:18:01.297 --> 00:18:02.798
You'll do it, right?

215
00:18:06.368 --> 00:18:08.070
I should get back to work, Spiritual Father.

216
00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:38.200
Those who conceal Almighty's glory...

217
00:18:38.501 --> 00:18:40.269
will perish in fire...

218
00:18:42.438 --> 00:18:46.509
on the day of judgment.

219
00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:10.499
I believe in Almighty who has prepared...

220
00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:12.968
the Boat of Salvation and allowed us...

221
00:19:12.968 --> 00:19:15.738
to ready ourselves for the day of judgement.

222
00:19:16.038 --> 00:19:18.707
"The one who believes in me will live, even though they die."

223
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:20.776
"And whoever lives..."

224
00:19:20.776 --> 00:19:24.547
"by believing in me will never die." I believe in your words.

225
00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:25.307
You are now...

226
00:20:26.675 --> 00:20:28.777
the body of Almighty.

227
00:20:29.578 --> 00:20:31.480
No one...

228
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:36.118
will be able to stand against you.

229
00:23:24.787 --> 00:23:25.988
Sang Jin.

230
00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:28.290
I've been waiting for you all day.

231
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.958
You should come home straight from school.

232
00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:31.760
Where have you been?

233
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.128
Ms. Kim.

234
00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:36.231
Don't leave me alone.

235
00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:37.766
Mom.

236
00:23:43.338 --> 00:23:44.807
Why are you here?

237
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.341
Sang Mi.

238
00:23:47.876 --> 00:23:50.479
This is too dangerous. You should leave now.

239
00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:54.016
Sang Mi, let's get out of here together.

240
00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:55.551
No.

241
00:23:56.452 --> 00:23:57.719
It's not the time yet.

242
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:03.358
Let's go.

243
00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:06.728
You should be in the sanitarium, not here.

244
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:08.130
Okay.

245
00:24:13.068 --> 00:24:14.069
Sang Mi.

246
00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:19.341
Is it you, Spiritual Mother?

247
00:24:19.808 --> 00:24:22.177
I'm okay. Hurry up and go.

248
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:36.558
I guess your mother came to hear Spiritual Father's sermon.

249
00:24:37.226 --> 00:24:38.961
Yes, Apostle Kang.

250
00:24:39.928 --> 00:24:44.099
Please take good care of Sang Jin and Sang Mi.

251
00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:47.569
Of course. Please don't worry.

252
00:24:52.908 --> 00:25:00.516
(The Boat of Salvation Will Save You.)

253
00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:19.001
By the way,

254
00:25:19.301 --> 00:25:22.671
I guess the one who always drives this van isn't here today.

255
00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:26.875
Gosh, you have a keen eye, Dong Cheol.

256
00:25:27.209 --> 00:25:30.679
You said you invest in stocks. I guess it's because you're smart.

257
00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:34.850
It's not that. He just has a very large build.

258
00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:37.519
He went to run some errands.

259
00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:39.588
We're looking for someone.

260
00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:43.058
Do you have any friends...

261
00:25:43.058 --> 00:25:46.628
who often go around riding a motorcycle?

262
00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:49.998
Every kid in this town rides motorcycles.

263
00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:53.669
Why are you looking for them?

264
00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:56.438
Do you have any friends like that?

265
00:25:56.939 --> 00:26:00.375
No, I'm just curious.

266
00:26:03.345 --> 00:26:07.149
They left without a contact number after doing something good.

267
00:26:07.349 --> 00:26:10.118
We'd like to return their favor.

268
00:26:11.186 --> 00:26:14.056
Gosh, they must have done something really good.

269
00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:15.390
Yes.

270
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:18.427
I hope we find them soon.

271
00:26:29.071 --> 00:26:30.606
We're here.

272
00:26:32.808 --> 00:26:33.875
See you tomorrow.

273
00:26:33.875 --> 00:26:35.010
Thank you.

274
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.680
Listen. We have a seminar tomorrow,

275
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.149
so you'll have a chance to ask questions.

276
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.318
- Okay. - Goodbye.

277
00:26:43.318 --> 00:26:44.920
- Dong Cheol. - Yes?

278
00:26:46.121 --> 00:26:47.456
I really hope you'll come tomorrow.

279
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:49.658
Okay.

280
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.128
See you tomorrow.

281
00:26:56.198 --> 00:26:57.599
Please drive safely.

282
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:09.711
Who are you?

283
00:27:10.178 --> 00:27:13.048
I'm a reporter. I'm collecting news about this cult under cover.

284
00:27:18.086 --> 00:27:19.721
(I don't know why you came here,)

285
00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:21.356
(but do not come back to this place.)

286
00:27:26.261 --> 00:27:28.630
Goodness. He really is a crazy man.

287
00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:32.668
Have you gone crazy too? Why did you go there?

288
00:27:32.668 --> 00:27:34.836
He's right, you crazy punk.

289
00:27:39.007 --> 00:27:40.008
Listen.

290
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.811
I think...

291
00:27:43.378 --> 00:27:46.548
my dad joined hands with that cult leader.

292
00:27:47.449 --> 00:27:50.118
That's why I wanted to see it for myself.

293
00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:54.289
I wanted to bring everything that can be evidence.

294
00:27:55.991 --> 00:27:56.958
I'm sorry.

295
00:28:00.095 --> 00:28:01.096
It's fine.

296
00:28:01.897 --> 00:28:05.267
Whatever your dad does,

297
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:07.536
you're not going to run away, right?

298
00:28:13.208 --> 00:28:14.509
Jung Hoon.

299
00:28:15.911 --> 00:28:19.881
I want you to broadcast the video of the cult leader I filmed.

300
00:28:20.248 --> 00:28:23.218
I thought about it. If my dad is on the same side with him,

301
00:28:23.218 --> 00:28:26.488
no one including the police and the press will believe us.

302
00:28:26.488 --> 00:28:28.356
We have to show it...

303
00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:30.926
directly to people and make them believe us.

304
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.096
Okay. I got it.

305
00:28:53.048 --> 00:28:54.349
(Guseonwon)

306
00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:55.617
All right, it's done.

307
00:28:56.051 --> 00:28:58.019
Oh, here.

308
00:28:59.221 --> 00:29:01.456
A woman at Guseonwon gave me this.

309
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:02.858
What is it?

310
00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:09.998
"I don't know why you're here, but don't ever come back."

311
00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:11.466
My gosh, what is this?

312
00:29:11.466 --> 00:29:14.569
I just know that she's an undercover journalist.

313
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:16.538
- She's a journalist? - Yes.

314
00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:20.575
"Don't ever come back"? Do you think this is a warning or a threat?

315
00:29:20.575 --> 00:29:22.811
I guess I'll find out after I ask her in person.

316
00:29:23.545 --> 00:29:27.048
Anyway, these guys don't seem like an ordinary cult.

317
00:29:27.048 --> 00:29:30.218
And that cult leader seems scarier than we thought he'd be.

318
00:29:30.318 --> 00:29:31.586
You should be careful, Dong Cheol.

319
00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:33.555
You should be careful.

320
00:29:34.156 --> 00:29:35.690
The same goes for you guys too.

321
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.260
The curly haired guy's looking all over the place for you two.

322
00:29:39.461 --> 00:29:41.129
Okay, let's all be careful.

323
00:29:41.129 --> 00:29:42.297
I'll check...

324
00:29:42.597 --> 00:29:45.801
if that journalist is someone we can trust and rely on.

325
00:29:45.967 --> 00:29:49.638
I'll also look into what these guys did before they came to Muji.

326
00:29:51.907 --> 00:29:53.241
I have to go now.

327
00:29:53.241 --> 00:29:54.609
Why? Let's grab a drink.

328
00:29:55.076 --> 00:29:57.045
I have somewhere I need to go.

329
00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:58.446
See you guys tomorrow.

330
00:29:59.581 --> 00:30:00.849
He's always so busy.

331
00:30:06.188 --> 00:30:07.355
What's...

332
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.758
your identity?

333
00:30:10.358 --> 00:30:11.359
Pardon?

334
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.695
- Well... - I saw everything.

335
00:30:13.695 --> 00:30:17.699
You stopped that guy earlier from trying to help me.

336
00:30:20.435 --> 00:30:22.571
I don't understand what you're saying.

337
00:30:23.338 --> 00:30:26.908
Spiritual Mother, Apostle Kang asked me to do something...

338
00:30:37.018 --> 00:30:38.820
Do you really believe that...

339
00:30:39.621 --> 00:30:41.890
you can get on the Boat of Salvation by staying here?

340
00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:44.960
Do you really believe...

341
00:30:46.695 --> 00:30:49.030
everything that the so-called "Spiritual Father" says to you?

342
00:30:50.498 --> 00:30:52.701
I really don't understand what you mean.

343
00:30:52.701 --> 00:30:54.269
You already know everything.

344
00:30:56.137 --> 00:30:57.505
You know that...

345
00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.908
this place is all fake.

346
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.849
Why are you pretending like you don't know anything?

347
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.918
Isn't it worse to pretend like...

348
00:31:10.418 --> 00:31:12.320
you don't know anything when you do?

349
00:31:17.559 --> 00:31:18.760
Why do you think...

350
00:31:19.728 --> 00:31:22.330
I'm pretending like I don't know anything?

351
00:31:23.665 --> 00:31:25.300
Because you also seemed to be...

352
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:28.970
observing this place, just like me.

353
00:31:29.571 --> 00:31:32.641
Then I finally realized when you asked me that question...

354
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:33.675
at the nursing home.

355
00:31:34.175 --> 00:31:36.511
You should run away.

356
00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:40.515
If you stay here, your body and soul will die.

357
00:31:42.417 --> 00:31:44.619
Then why aren't you leaving?

358
00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:47.289
That question.

359
00:31:48.456 --> 00:31:51.159
I've been asking that question so many times.

360
00:31:52.627 --> 00:31:54.429
"Why didn't you leave?"

361
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.399
I've been here for over four years,

362
00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:00.835
but nobody ever asked me that question.

363
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:13.248
You're right. I don't believe this place.

364
00:32:21.957 --> 00:32:23.458
Do you really not...

365
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.028
believe this place?

366
00:32:30.665 --> 00:32:31.766
No.

367
00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:33.768
To be honest,

368
00:32:36.805 --> 00:32:37.939
I'm a journalist.

369
00:32:39.307 --> 00:32:42.110
I couldn't find anything weird about this place from outside.

370
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:46.281
So I've disguised myself as a believer to collect information.

371
00:32:46.848 --> 00:32:49.517
These people never leave any kind of evidence behind.

372
00:32:49.851 --> 00:32:51.419
I've only recently managed to...

373
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.456
get close to finding anything.

374
00:32:57.058 --> 00:32:58.259
Then...

375
00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:01.930
I'll help you from now on.

376
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:04.299
What?

377
00:33:04.899 --> 00:33:07.268
I'm going to destroy this place no matter what.

378
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.339
So you should help me too.

379
00:33:12.807 --> 00:33:14.309
Are you sure about this?

380
00:33:14.809 --> 00:33:16.778
I have friends who are trying to help me.

381
00:33:17.679 --> 00:33:20.648
Now, I also have you too.

382
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.318
Okay.

383
00:33:24.185 --> 00:33:26.021
I'll do my best to help you.

384
00:33:30.058 --> 00:33:33.695
Spiritual Mother, please deliver my prayers to Spiritual Father.

385
00:33:33.695 --> 00:33:35.730
- Please deliver it to him. - Sister So Rin.

386
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.299
How dare you cause a scene in front of our future Spiritual Mother?

387
00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:41.736
You can't cheat like this.

388
00:33:41.736 --> 00:33:43.705
She's right. Spiritual Mother.

389
00:33:43.705 --> 00:33:46.241
- Don't listen to her prayers. - She's right.

390
00:33:49.711 --> 00:33:51.146
Our Almighty told us...

391
00:33:51.579 --> 00:33:54.649
not to ignore the prayers of the weak.

392
00:33:55.717 --> 00:33:58.920
You can tell me anything you want as well.

393
00:34:00.088 --> 00:34:03.091
I'll deliver your prayers to Spiritual Father.

394
00:34:09.964 --> 00:34:11.199
Spiritual Mother.

395
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.935
I have a son.

396
00:34:14.235 --> 00:34:15.870
And he's...

397
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:19.441
Spiritual Mother, please help my mother.

398
00:34:19.707 --> 00:34:22.210
Please help me save my son.

399
00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.046
- Spiritual Mother. - My goodness.

400
00:34:29.017 --> 00:34:30.018
Dong Cheol.

401
00:34:31.486 --> 00:34:32.620
What?

402
00:34:40.695 --> 00:34:41.830
Thanks.

403
00:34:43.231 --> 00:34:46.468
And I'm sorry for making you go to that dangerous place...

404
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:49.270
all alone.

405
00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:57.045
Do you know...

406
00:34:58.079 --> 00:35:00.148
what I hate hearing from you?

407
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.718
I hate it when you say sorry.

408
00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:12.060
To be honest, it wasn't your fault.

409
00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:16.598
The reason why you, Sang Mi, and I turned out this way...

410
00:35:17.765 --> 00:35:19.667
is all because of adults.

411
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:28.209
I thought...

412
00:35:29.811 --> 00:35:33.615
my mom would be able to wake up if my dad became the governor.

413
00:35:34.415 --> 00:35:36.718
I was foolish.

414
00:35:37.986 --> 00:35:39.087
Sang Hwan.

415
00:35:40.188 --> 00:35:43.558
Do you remember what you said to me...

416
00:35:43.925 --> 00:35:45.527
when I got expelled from school,

417
00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:48.296
and when you stopped the prisoner bus?

418
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.069
I said, "Stand tall."

419
00:36:39.581 --> 00:36:42.550
What's going on? Shouldn't we go check on her?

420
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.519
My gosh, just leave her be.

421
00:36:44.519 --> 00:36:47.188
Honey, please help me.

422
00:36:47.488 --> 00:36:49.891
You'll only end up getting your hair pulled out.

423
00:36:50.058 --> 00:36:52.927
- She'll tell you to save her son. - You're right. Let's go.

424
00:36:52.927 --> 00:36:54.929
- Please help. - Let's go. Hurry.

425
00:36:57.198 --> 00:37:00.435
Honey. Sang Mi.

426
00:37:02.537 --> 00:37:03.938
Sang Mi.

427
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.250
Apostle Im, is this your first time coming here?

428
00:37:16.217 --> 00:37:17.385
Yes.

429
00:37:17.385 --> 00:37:19.621
This will make you become an important apostle.

430
00:37:20.188 --> 00:37:21.589
This is a great blessing for you.

431
00:37:22.257 --> 00:37:24.759
Our wishes will be fulfilled. I believe it.

432
00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:28.196
This is place is filled with evil spirits.

433
00:37:28.896 --> 00:37:29.964
I see.

434
00:37:33.301 --> 00:37:36.704
- Now, let's go inside. - Okay.

435
00:37:51.886 --> 00:37:55.290
Can you smell the stench of the devil?

436
00:37:56.658 --> 00:37:57.959
Yes, I can.

437
00:37:58.126 --> 00:37:59.160
Come this way.

438
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.166
Help me.

439
00:38:38.866 --> 00:38:40.535
Please help me.

440
00:38:40.535 --> 00:38:42.236
After getting possessed by the devil,

441
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:46.674
he lead our believers to abandon their faith for Almighty.

442
00:38:47.008 --> 00:38:49.110
He's one of the worst.

443
00:38:53.815 --> 00:38:56.651
I... I'm sorry.

444
00:38:56.818 --> 00:38:58.886
What are you sorry about?

445
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.356
I dared...

446
00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:03.758
I dared to...

447
00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:06.361
doubt your power, Spiritual Father.

448
00:39:06.994 --> 00:39:09.130
You are the only one...

449
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.767
who can lead us to salvation.

450
00:39:13.201 --> 00:39:16.637
The act of using your words to seduce, deceive,

451
00:39:16.637 --> 00:39:18.740
and make people arrogant...

452
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.508
is the devil's...

453
00:39:21.409 --> 00:39:23.678
clever scheme.

454
00:39:39.527 --> 00:39:41.028
No...

455
00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:45.800
Spiritual Father.

456
00:39:51.439 --> 00:39:54.976
You nasty devil!

457
00:39:55.777 --> 00:40:01.616
I order you to leave from the body of my precious child!

458
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:18.132
Look carefully.

459
00:40:18.433 --> 00:40:21.869
His sins have gathered together and solidified...

460
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.238
in his stomach.

461
00:40:24.472 --> 00:40:27.008
When I lay my hands on a sinner,

462
00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:29.210
the pain that he or she will feel...

463
00:40:29.544 --> 00:40:32.814
will be proportional to his or her sin.

464
00:40:44.892 --> 00:40:46.661
Apostle Im, why don't you...

465
00:40:47.962 --> 00:40:49.831
pray for the sinners today?

466
00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:55.503
Me?

467
00:40:55.803 --> 00:40:57.939
From now on, I'd like you to...

468
00:40:58.473 --> 00:41:00.608
be in charge of this place...

469
00:41:01.108 --> 00:41:03.611
and help us get rid of the devil.

470
00:41:04.111 --> 00:41:05.913
But isn't this position...

471
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.651
only given to the most spiritually awakened apostle?

472
00:41:11.352 --> 00:41:16.023
You're the most spiritually awakened.

473
00:41:17.058 --> 00:41:18.159
Pardon?

474
00:41:19.293 --> 00:41:20.661
You gave...

475
00:41:21.462 --> 00:41:23.498
what's most precious to you...

476
00:41:24.932 --> 00:41:27.201
to our Almighty.

477
00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:35.543
Don't you agree,

478
00:41:36.611 --> 00:41:37.912
Apostle Kang?

479
00:41:40.381 --> 00:41:42.950
Yes, you're right. He gave our Almighty...

480
00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:45.553
his beloved daughter.

481
00:41:46.654 --> 00:41:48.222
- Apostle Im. - Yes?

482
00:41:48.222 --> 00:41:49.390
You should pray for him.

483
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:50.391
Okay.

484
00:41:54.028 --> 00:41:56.063
You nasty devil.

485
00:42:04.772 --> 00:42:08.442
I call you out under the name of our Almighty!

486
00:42:10.144 --> 00:42:13.548
I call you out with the power of our Almighty!

487
00:42:16.784 --> 00:42:19.654
I give you this order under the name of our Almighty.

488
00:42:19.754 --> 00:42:22.623
I order you to confess your sin!

489
00:42:23.858 --> 00:42:26.794
I command you to return to the fiery pit!

490
00:42:49.116 --> 00:42:50.217
What?

491
00:42:54.388 --> 00:42:55.590
Come in, and eat dinner.

492
00:42:59.927 --> 00:43:01.896
Our dear Sister Park Bong Hee here...

493
00:43:02.096 --> 00:43:05.700
made a special offering to Almighty today...

494
00:43:05.766 --> 00:43:07.835
for Spiritual Mother's sake.

495
00:43:12.206 --> 00:43:13.307
Is he your friend?

496
00:43:15.476 --> 00:43:17.979
I made you dinner. You should eat before you go to work.

497
00:43:18.646 --> 00:43:19.947
Where are you going again?

498
00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:24.318
Jin Cheol's mother asked me to help her with something again.

499
00:43:26.621 --> 00:43:29.056
Did you borrow money from someone?

500
00:43:29.056 --> 00:43:30.858
Why are you working so much these days?

501
00:43:32.159 --> 00:43:34.395
What are you talking about? That's nonsense.

502

If you need money,

503
00:43:37.798 --> 00:43:40.034
don't ask weird people for help.

504
00:43:40.134 --> 00:43:42.570
Just ask me. Okay?

505
00:43:43.237 --> 00:43:44.338
Okay.

509
00:44:10.431 --> 00:44:11.766
Today,

510
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.770
your dad became an apostle in charge to get rid of evil spirits.

511

Do you know what that is?

512
00:44:19.907 --> 00:44:21.409
That position is given to...

513
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:27.248
the most faithful person in Guseonwon.

514
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:29.850
It wasn't given to Apostle Kang.

515
00:44:31.819 --> 00:44:33.120
It was given to me.

516
00:44:34.588 --> 00:44:37.258
I was given the position to get rid of evil spirits.

517
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.795
And...

518
00:44:42.096 --> 00:44:44.298
Sang Mi will soon become our Spiritual Mother.

519
00:44:44.465 --> 00:44:45.966
Then our whole family...

520
00:44:46.634 --> 00:44:50.037
will all be able to get on the Boat of Salvation.

521

I'll ask the police chief to send some policemen over.

528
00:45:11.258 --> 00:45:14.929
Don't bother. We can't blame these ignorant people.

529
00:45:15.129 --> 00:45:17.732
They're all just given orders by someone.

530
00:45:17.732 --> 00:45:20.568
Mr. Cheon's getting orders by Senator Park.

531

And Senator Park's...

532
00:45:23.571 --> 00:45:26.941
getting orders by Baek Jung Ki.

534
00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.450
I thought I was the president of Muji.

535
00:45:36.851 --> 00:45:41.021
But I guess someone else was actually becoming the president.

536
00:45:44.959 --> 00:45:46.093
Here.

537
00:45:47.261 --> 00:45:48.662

Hey.

541
00:45:57.271 --> 00:45:58.739
Where's Dong Cheol?

542
00:45:58.739 --> 00:46:00.341
He's getting changed.

543
00:46:00.341 --> 00:46:01.542
I see.

544
00:46:02.143 --> 00:46:03.677
Did you find anything out?

545
00:46:03.677 --> 00:46:05.913
They have a nursing home,

546
00:46:05.913 --> 00:46:07.581
and they do a lot of volunteer work.

547
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:09.083
I could only find positive articles about them.

548
00:46:10.951 --> 00:46:14.922
I can't believe he even has the police and reporters on his side.

549
00:46:14.922 --> 00:46:17.458
But then again, what can't you do with money these days?

550
00:46:18.292 --> 00:46:21.262
I'd like to let you know that not all policemen are like that.

551
00:46:21.262 --> 00:46:22.730
Please leave my dad out of this.

552
00:46:24.899 --> 00:46:28.202
Yes, okay. I know your dad's not that kind of person.

553
00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:30.771
Yes, of course. He just doesn't do his work properly.

554
00:46:30.771 --> 00:46:33.674
That's... That's true.

555
00:46:33.841 --> 00:46:34.842
I agree.

Hey, Dong Cheol.

559
00:46:47.488 --> 00:46:50.291
You may know already, but those guys are really clever.

560
00:46:50.291 --> 00:46:51.992
They act like they're a legal community,

561
00:46:51.992 --> 00:46:54.662
but all the critical evidence will all be hidden inside.

562
00:46:54.662 --> 00:46:56.330
You got in there with your guts,

563
00:46:56.597 --> 00:46:59.099
so let's increase our winning rate by using our brain.

the secret behind salvation and eternal life.

569
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:19.019
This place is spiritually detached from...

570
00:47:19.019 --> 00:47:21.021
the world you are all living in.

571
00:47:21.222 --> 00:47:22.289
So from now on,

572
00:47:22.289 --> 00:47:25.059
you'll have to turn in your cell phones whenever you come here.

573
00:47:25.192 --> 00:47:27.528
It's just like how you don't wear anything in a public bathhouse.

574
00:47:27.528 --> 00:47:30.631
You should take everything off in order to cleanse yourself properly.

Why are you giving me your cell phone?

577
00:47:33.901 --> 00:47:35.469
Sang Mi told me.

578
00:47:35.703 --> 00:47:38.339
I heard the believers there aren't allowed to use cell phones.

579
00:47:38.672 --> 00:47:41.242
They always kept an eye on Sang Mi and even locked her up.

580
00:47:41.242 --> 00:47:42.843
So they probably have strict regulations.

581
00:47:44.278 --> 00:47:46.213
- Go ahead. - Thank you.

582
00:47:50.017 --> 00:47:53.053

Where? The newspaper company?

I should go there in person and check.

like the cross to us.

00:50:54.868 --> 00:50:57.771
To us, it's even more important than the cross...

615

as it symbolizes salvation. You all got that, right?

00:55:23.537 --> 00:55:25.072
Stir once...

665
00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:27.641
and say, "Please forgive my sin."

666
00:55:28.008 --> 00:55:29.343
Do it.

667
00:55:38.051 --> 00:55:39.553
Almighty,

668
00:55:41.221 --> 00:55:44.057
I doubted that you're my savior...

669
00:55:45.225 --> 00:55:47.160
and said that you're fake.

670
00:55:48.362 --> 00:55:51.698
Please forgive my sin.

671
00:55:56.837 --> 00:56:01.108
I resented my dad for bringing...

672
00:56:02.342 --> 00:56:03.944
my family here.

673
00:56:05.345 --> 00:56:08.482
Please forgive my sin.

674
00:56:10.817 --> 00:56:12.953
Good. Keep going.

675
00:56:18.191 --> 00:56:21.495
I resented and hated Apostle Kang Eun Sil who's in front of me now.

676
00:56:22.262 --> 00:56:24.197
Please forgive my sin.

677
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.169
I said that Apostle Jo Wan Deok is a murderer.

678
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:32.339
Please forgive my sin.

679
00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:37.744
I thought that everyone here was insane.

680
00:56:38.712 --> 00:56:42.048
Please forgive my sin.

681
00:56:46.052 --> 00:56:47.120
Sang Mi.

682
00:56:49.623 --> 00:56:51.758
Is the training going well?

683
00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.061
Is Mom doing okay?

684
00:56:56.363 --> 00:56:59.399
She didn't look well the last time I saw her.

685
00:57:00.467 --> 00:57:03.003
Apostle Kang is doing her best...

686
00:57:03.136 --> 00:57:06.306
to take great care of her, so you don't need to worry about her.

687
00:57:06.773 --> 00:57:10.110
Oh, she actually just left to go to the sanitarium again.

688
00:57:22.656 --> 00:57:23.790
Mom.

689
00:57:25.792 --> 00:57:27.160
Is it you, Sang Jin?

690
00:57:28.628 --> 00:57:29.763
Sang Jin!

691
00:57:30.864 --> 00:57:34.201
Where do you think you're going? Let's have some fun.

692
00:57:35.035 --> 00:57:38.839
Don't you know that you'll never be able to get out of here?

693
00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:44.411
Sang Jin! Sang Jin, help me. Sang Jin!

694
00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:46.346
Sang Jin!

695
00:57:46.346 --> 00:57:47.481
Mom!

696
00:57:48.014 --> 00:57:49.249
Sang Jin.

697
00:57:49.249 --> 00:57:53.053
You need to get out of here for Sang Mi to live, so please...

698
00:57:55.055 --> 00:57:56.656
Please save Sang Mi.

699
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.061
Sang Mi...

700
00:58:01.862 --> 00:58:03.163
Sang Mi!

701
00:58:45.939 --> 00:58:48.808
No... No, Sang Mi.

702
00:58:49.175 --> 00:58:52.112
Sang Jin! Help me, Sang Jin.

703
00:58:52.112 --> 00:58:55.081
Come to your senses, Mom! You have to get out of here.

704
00:58:55.081 --> 00:58:56.783
Sister Kim.

705
00:58:59.953 --> 00:59:01.521
Sang Mi!

706
00:59:08.828 --> 00:59:10.897
The most precious thing...

707
00:59:11.398 --> 00:59:14.601
will be harvested.

708
00:59:14.601 --> 00:59:16.770
Three years have passed, yet you still...

709
00:59:17.837 --> 00:59:19.673
have downy hair like a baby.

710
00:59:25.345 --> 00:59:26.846
You should drink a lot of water.

711
01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:10.490
Sang Mi.

712
01:00:13.927 --> 01:00:15.061
Sang Mi.

713
01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:14.187
Sang Mi.

714
01:01:15.522 --> 01:01:17.357
Sang Mi, you should run away.

715
01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:20.827
Run.

716
01:01:21.327 --> 01:01:22.462
Sang Mi...

717
01:02:12.011 --> 01:02:14.681
(Save Me)

718
01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:19.953
It's burning hot.

719
01:02:20.854 --> 01:02:24.057
If you keep neglecting all the resentment and sorrow in your heart,

720
01:02:26.459 --> 01:02:27.827
you'll end up burning...

721
01:02:28.628 --> 01:02:31.698
yourself as well as everything around you.

722
01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:34.234
So now, you should...

723
01:02:35.068 --> 01:02:37.637
surrender everything to Almighty.

724
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:44.611
How do I do that?

725
01:02:46.312 --> 01:02:47.547
What should I do...

726
01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:50.950
to surrender my everything to Almighty?
