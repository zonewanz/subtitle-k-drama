(Episode 14)

2
00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:33.202
Who are you?

3
00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:36.433
You jerks made my mom get all bruised,

4
00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:39.202
saying that you're giving her a prayer.

5
00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:40.912
You guys need to pay for what you did.

6
00:00:40.912 --> 00:00:43.372
Hey, stop...

7
00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.382
Stop that immediately!

8
00:00:55.592 --> 00:00:58.122
Sang Mi. Get out of here.

9
00:00:58.463 --> 00:00:59.463
Dad.

10
00:00:59.963 --> 00:01:01.162
Don't worry.

11
00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:03.833
Almighty will protect me.

12
00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:08.232
All right. Let's see if he'll really protect you.

13
00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:12.043
We shall find out.

14
00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:19.082
Get out of here with Spiritual Mother!

15
00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:20.883
- Let's go. - Now!

16
00:01:20.883 --> 00:01:21.982
Hurry.

17
00:01:23.913 --> 00:01:26.622
What? Why are you here?

18
00:01:26.622 --> 00:01:28.053
Are you one of them?

19
00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:32.323
Sang Mi, we must hurry.

20
00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:42.002
Listen to me carefully now.

21
00:01:42.232 --> 00:01:43.972
I'm not one of them.

22
00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:46.603
I just want to kill everyone here.

23
00:01:46.603 --> 00:01:49.273
What? Why are you stopping me then?

24
00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:50.883
Didn't you say...

25
00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:54.082
you want to make a lot of money and live with your mom in a nice place?

26
00:02:02.823 --> 00:02:03.952
I will...

27
00:02:04.963 --> 00:02:07.493
destroy this place no matter what.

28
00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:09.962
Could you please trust me and go back?

29
00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:12.103
Where is he?

30
00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:14.473
What are you doing? Are you okay?

31
00:02:14.473 --> 00:02:16.672
Dae Sik, punch me.

32
00:02:17.943 --> 00:02:19.103
Dae Sik!

33
00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.313
What on earth is happening? Let's go inside.

34
00:02:21.313 --> 00:02:23.073
- What's going on? - Hurry.

35
00:02:24.742 --> 00:02:26.742
Goodness! Hey!

36
00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:29.952
- Are you okay? My gosh. - Are you all right?

37
00:02:32.982 --> 00:02:34.522
Come on.

38
00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:38.163
I'm okay.

39
00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:43.633
Dong Cheol.

40
00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:47.133
I thought you were slow-witted, but you're quite manly.

41
00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:50.973
I just thought I had to protect Spiritual Mother.

42
00:02:51.242 --> 00:02:53.603
What made you think that?

43
00:02:56.413 --> 00:03:00.952
I was told that she will cleanse us of our original sin.

44
00:03:02.353 --> 00:03:03.452
Isn't it right?

45
00:03:03.612 --> 00:03:06.682
You have such a pure soul.

46
00:03:07.283 --> 00:03:12.093
Almighty will make great use of you.

47
00:03:23.732 --> 00:03:25.573
How did it go with the chief of police?

48
00:03:26.543 --> 00:03:27.642
Let me have a sip of this first.

49
00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:38.323
The police force is an organization, and I'm a member of it.

50
00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:43.593
Did you call me here to tell me you can't investigate?

51
00:03:43.593 --> 00:03:46.123
You know that we don't have anything concrete...

52
00:03:46.123 --> 00:03:48.593
except the rumors about his sexual assault and embezzlement.

53
00:03:48.763 --> 00:03:50.263
The police need proof.

54
00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:51.503
Proof?

55
00:03:52.063 --> 00:03:54.302
We recorded the pastor's statement earlier.

56
00:03:54.432 --> 00:03:57.302
We'll soon find the account books and his fake certificate.

57
00:03:57.302 --> 00:03:59.973
That's forgery of official document, fraud, and embezzlement.

58
00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.413
Once the investigation starts,

59
00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:03.313
they'll have to look for the victim of the sexual assault.

60
00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:08.283
By the way, mister. I heard...

61
00:04:08.452 --> 00:04:11.452
you were a competent detective from Seoul. Is it really true?

62
00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:15.693
It's not "mister". Call me Detective Lee.

63
00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:20.892
Who is your friend who went into Guseonwon?

64
00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:22.193
You don't need to know that.

65
00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:24.133
Gosh, why are you hiding it?

66
00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:26.402
Do you think I would disturb your plan?

67
00:04:27.573 --> 00:04:30.073
I don't want to put my friend in danger.

68
00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:36.042
Dong Cheol, you can go back to your room.

69
00:04:36.712 --> 00:04:37.743
Okay.

70
00:04:38.313 --> 00:04:39.513
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

71
00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:46.582
I see you working hard.

72
00:04:47.183 --> 00:04:49.592
We're getting less offerings these days.

73
00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:53.623
If we run out of funds, we'll have to send...

74
00:04:53.722 --> 00:04:56.292
those poor people back to the evil world outside.

75
00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.803
So please try a little harder, Apostle Kang.

76
00:04:58.803 --> 00:05:00.633
What are you suggesting I should do?

77
00:05:01.573 --> 00:05:04.702
Well, we can have a revival service.

78
00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:08.013
Do you think we can have...

79
00:05:08.013 --> 00:05:10.673
a revival service any time we want?

80
00:05:11.683 --> 00:05:13.383
Don't be so fussy.

81
00:05:13.383 --> 00:05:16.712
It's your greed that made that detective come here.

82
00:05:16.912 --> 00:05:19.282
You're accusing an innocent person.

83
00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:22.823
Why is it because of me? I'm also saved by Almighty.

84
00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:25.193
It's not salvation that you sought here.

85
00:05:25.193 --> 00:05:27.933
You just wanted money. Do you think I don't know that?

86
00:05:28.263 --> 00:05:31.433
Listen, I take care of all our affairs here.

87
00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:34.373
Isn't it natural that I pay attention to our funds too?

88
00:05:34.373 --> 00:05:36.073
You have taken enough amount,

89
00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:37.873
so please leave now.

90
00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:41.272
Spiritual Father and I will lead this place from now on.

91
00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:46.683
Eun Sil, you're biting the hand that fed you.

92
00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:49.253
Have you forgotten?

93
00:05:50.212 --> 00:05:52.053
I haven't forgotten it at all.

94
00:05:52.983 --> 00:05:54.592
Stop bringing...

95
00:05:54.852 --> 00:05:57.823
demons into this place with your false faith, and leave now.

96
00:06:01.162 --> 00:06:04.402
Your husband. It's the man you killed.

97
00:06:04.402 --> 00:06:08.102
I pulled strings so you won't go to prison for it.

98
00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:10.133
And now, you're telling me to leave?

99
00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:27.082
It wasn't you who helped me. It was Almighty.

100
00:06:27.183 --> 00:06:30.652
You were merely used by Almighty for his plan.

101
00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:33.162
I cleaned up after you,

102
00:06:34.063 --> 00:06:35.733
and now you're saying it wasn't me.

103
00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:39.662
That must be why you've been holding your head so high.

104
00:06:40.363 --> 00:06:43.102
Do you know why I've curried favor with you all?

105
00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.402
Because I'm scared of you?

106
00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:48.113
You and Baek Jung Ki are...

107
00:06:48.243 --> 00:06:52.983
just cash cow to me. I humor you because it keeps you happy,

108
00:06:53.142 --> 00:06:55.712
and you will get money from those people.

109
00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:59.352
Let go of me, you evil demon.

110
00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:00.952
Let go of me.

111
00:07:03.952 --> 00:07:06.123
Eun Sil, do you see it now?

112
00:07:07.563 --> 00:07:09.662
Do you see who really has power here?

113
00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.813
Almighty.

114
00:07:28.553 --> 00:07:30.712
I've devoted everything to you.

115
00:07:31.323 --> 00:07:35.022
My daughter, my family, my time,

116
00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:37.392
and even my life.

117
00:07:40.892 --> 00:07:42.133
Almighty.

118
00:07:44.832 --> 00:07:46.532
Please don't abandon me.

119

(Guseonwon Sanitarium)

120
00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:15.292
Hello.

121
00:08:17.733 --> 00:08:19.133
I'm a friend of Sang Mi.

122
00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:25.472
You're Sang Mi's friend?

123
00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:27.472
Yes.

124
00:08:29.373 --> 00:08:30.673
Where is Sang Mi?

125
00:08:33.812 --> 00:08:34.912
Sang Mi...

126
00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:37.552
wanted me to tell you...

127
00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:40.623
that you don't need to worry about her,

128
00:08:41.223 --> 00:08:44.123
and that she wants you to hang in there a little longer.

129
00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:47.633
My dear daughter.

130
00:08:48.363 --> 00:08:50.763
I need to see her myself.

131
00:08:52.233 --> 00:08:53.562
You can't see her right now.

132
00:08:56.833 --> 00:09:00.373
I should go and protect Sang Mi.

133
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.572
I know it's hard, but you have to keep calm.

134
00:09:04.613 --> 00:09:06.243
You've been doped up with drugs,

135
00:09:06.343 --> 00:09:08.113
and you just came to your senses.

136
00:09:08.883 --> 00:09:11.152
You can't protect Sang Mi when you're so weak.

137
00:09:16.253 --> 00:09:19.292
For now, you have to keep acting...

138
00:09:20.062 --> 00:09:21.733
until your body recovers.

139
00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:26.463
Only then can we deceive all those people.

140
00:09:30.333 --> 00:09:31.603
I understood.

141
00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:36.812
I'll be going now then.

142
00:09:36.812 --> 00:09:38.942
I can't stay here for too long.

143
00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:42.152
Wait.

144
00:09:47.493 --> 00:09:48.792
Here.

145
00:09:52.363 --> 00:09:54.692
Please give this to Sang Mi.

146
00:09:56.593 --> 00:09:57.802
Please tell her...

147
00:09:58.763 --> 00:10:00.263
that I'm sorry...

148
00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:02.733
and that I love her.

149
00:10:11.213 --> 00:10:12.383
I promise...

150
00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:14.912
you will be able to get out of here.

151
00:10:15.912 --> 00:10:17.013
So...

152
00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:20.223
please hang in there a little longer.

153
00:10:24.522 --> 00:10:26.093
Okay.

154

157
00:11:44.172 --> 00:11:45.473
What is this?

158
00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.213
Why does it say Sang Mi is a patient here?

159
00:12:02.253 --> 00:12:05.892
Almighty, you saved me with your precious blood. I believe in you.

160
00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:09.192
Please protect my mind from the temptation of the evil...

161
00:12:10.333 --> 00:12:13.503
and help me stay obedient to you even through the ordeal and pain.

162
00:12:13.503 --> 00:12:15.672
You and Baek Jung Ki are just cash cow to me.

(Muji Daily)

165
00:12:43.233 --> 00:12:44.603
I found the medical record.

166
00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.312
All believers here are recorded as patients.

167
00:13:00.042 --> 00:13:01.613
Why do you think they did it?

168
00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:08.723
They made fake patients and prescriptions...

169
00:13:08.953 --> 00:13:11.662
to obtain psychotropic drugs illegally.

170
00:13:11.993 --> 00:13:14.162
They force-fed those pills...

171
00:13:14.162 --> 00:13:16.493
to your mom or other people.

172
00:13:16.892 --> 00:13:19.203
Also, they must have tried to raise the sanitarium's grade...

173
00:13:19.203 --> 00:13:21.873
and get the state subsidies by increasing the number of patients.

174
00:13:22.473 --> 00:13:23.532
Look at this.

175
00:13:23.932 --> 00:13:26.672
It's signed by the director of the sanatorium and Baek Jung Ki.

176
00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:29.243
This means they all took part in this.

177
00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:30.672
But do you think...

178
00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:32.942
the police will willingly investigate this?

179
00:13:32.942 --> 00:13:34.353
It'll be hard for the police in Muji to get involved.

180
00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:38.723
I have a friend who works at a broadcasting station in Seoul.

181
00:13:38.723 --> 00:13:40.652
I'll take this to Seoul and contact a broadcasting station there.

182
00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:42.453
I'll try to make this into a national problem.

183
00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:44.792
Then the police and prosecution of Muji...

184
00:13:44.792 --> 00:13:46.292
won't be able to ignore this.

185
00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:47.392
I don't think...

186
00:13:48.292 --> 00:13:50.532
we have much time left.

187
00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:54.032
I'll go to Seoul right now and come back with some help.

188
00:14:07.912 --> 00:14:09.013
Thanks.

189
00:14:10.213 --> 00:14:13.753
Don't thank me. This could only happen because you stood strong.

190
00:14:20.322 --> 00:14:21.463
Here.

191
00:14:25.963 --> 00:14:27.062
Your mom wanted to...

192
00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:30.432
let you know that she's okay and told me to give this to you.

193
00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:42.613
Wait. Wait.

194
00:14:48.152 --> 00:14:51.392
Sister So Rin, where do you keep going these days?

195
00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:55.133
Sorry? Oh, my mom's ill.

196
00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:57.093
Apostle Kang is looking for you.

197
00:14:58.062 --> 00:14:59.103
Hurry.

198
00:14:59.103 --> 00:15:00.103
Okay.

199
00:15:08.642 --> 00:15:10.473
We brought her here, Apostle Kang.

200
00:15:11.282 --> 00:15:13.883
Why did you want to see me, Apostle Kang?

201
00:15:13.883 --> 00:15:14.883
Where did you say...

202
00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:18.052
you went to two days ago?

203
00:15:19.453 --> 00:15:23.223
I told you that I had to go home to visit my mom for her birthday.

204
00:15:24.493 --> 00:15:27.422
I feel like there are so many devils in this place these days.

205
00:15:27.532 --> 00:15:30.162
I should've been careful not to bring them in in the first place.

206
00:15:35.272 --> 00:15:38.072
What did I say happens to you when you lie before our Almighty?

207
00:15:38.243 --> 00:15:41.213
I found out that you weren't a student before you came here.

208
00:15:42.213 --> 00:15:43.613
You were a reporter.

209
00:15:44.042 --> 00:15:46.113
You were a local news reporter at Muji Daily.

210
00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:48.953
Apostle Kang, please let me explain.

211
00:15:48.953 --> 00:15:51.182
Did you come here to approach Sang Mi?

212
00:15:51.182 --> 00:15:54.792
No, that's not it. I think there has been a misunderstanding.

213
00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:58.822
You filthy creature. I cannot stand you.

214
00:15:59.593 --> 00:16:02.662
How can you be so brazen before our Almighty?

215
00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:04.703
Put her inside.

216
00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:08.902
Apostle Kang. Apostle Kang, wait.

217
00:16:20.042 --> 00:16:21.152
Who else is there?

218
00:16:21.483 --> 00:16:23.013
Who else...

219
00:16:23.013 --> 00:16:26.223
is a devil in disguise trying to destroy Guseonwon like you?

220
00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:29.152
I'm going to get rid of every single devil in this place.

221
00:16:31.562 --> 00:16:34.863
Today is the day that our soon-to-be Spiritual Mother...

222
00:16:35.263 --> 00:16:39.003
is going to share what she's learned through her spiritual training...

223
00:16:39.603 --> 00:16:41.603
with our believers...

224
00:16:41.973 --> 00:16:45.373
and her mother.

225
00:16:46.603 --> 00:16:48.912
A Spiritual Mother should be able to...

226
00:16:48.912 --> 00:16:51.042
speak the language of paradise...

227
00:16:51.383 --> 00:16:54.853
in front of all our believers from now on.

228
00:16:55.182 --> 00:17:00.223
If Sang Mi has diligently learned...

229
00:17:00.483 --> 00:17:04.662
what Apostle Kang has taught her,

230
00:17:05.562 --> 00:17:07.292
I trust that our Almighty will...

231
00:17:08.733 --> 00:17:14.233
grant her with the ability to speak the language of paradise today.

232
00:17:14.632 --> 00:17:16.433
- We believe it! - We believe it!

233
00:17:16.433 --> 00:17:18.342
- We believe it! - We believe it!

234
00:17:19.173 --> 00:17:21.713
Honey, watch carefully.

235
00:17:21.872 --> 00:17:25.713
Look how faithful our daughter has become.

236
00:17:35.493 --> 00:17:37.092
My savior.

237
00:17:39.263 --> 00:17:44.302
I believe in you, my Almighty, who has granted me life.

238
00:17:45.332 --> 00:17:49.403
You have brought our family here...

239
00:17:50.503 --> 00:17:54.003
and enabled us to meet Spiritual Father.

240
00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:56.173
And...

241
00:18:01.253 --> 00:18:02.612
And I believe that...

242
00:18:03.713 --> 00:18:06.183
the hardship you gave to my brother, Sang Jin, and my mother...

243
00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:09.923
was all part of your big plan to make me become...

244
00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:13.322
the Spiritual Mother.

245
00:18:14.062 --> 00:18:15.663
- I believe it. - I believe it.

246
00:18:29.173 --> 00:18:31.913
Spiritual Father!

247
00:20:04.643 --> 00:20:06.572
Make her take one pill a day.

248
00:20:24.362 --> 00:20:26.622
(Im Sang Mi)

249
00:20:26.622 --> 00:20:29.193
(Suffering depression and sleep disorder, zolpidem prescribed)

250
00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:33.562
I think we should test Sang Mi...

251
00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:37.943
if she's truly capable of becoming our Spiritual Mother.

252
00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:41.872
Okay.

253
00:20:42.673 --> 00:20:45.282
Why hasn't Jung Hoon come back? I can't reach him either.

254
00:20:45.782 --> 00:20:48.082
I wonder if he got caught by his dad when he went home.

255
00:20:50.253 --> 00:20:51.322
Just a second.

256
00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:55.622
- Gosh, it's so hot. - You're here.

257
00:20:56.122 --> 00:20:57.792
It's so cool here.

258
00:20:59.062 --> 00:21:02.963
Hey, is Jung Hoon going to church these days? It doesn't suit him.

259
00:21:03.393 --> 00:21:05.862
What did you just say?

260
00:21:05.963 --> 00:21:07.802
He was...

261
00:21:08.203 --> 00:21:11.743
going somewhere on a church van yesterday.

262
00:21:12.173 --> 00:21:13.342
A van?

263
00:21:13.342 --> 00:21:14.413
Yes.

264
00:21:16.913 --> 00:21:18.743
Did that van...

265
00:21:19.382 --> 00:21:21.812
have a sign saying "Guseonwon"?

266
00:21:22.852 --> 00:21:24.423
"Guseonwon"?

267
00:21:25.153 --> 00:21:27.493
It said, "Join us on the happy journey to paradise."

268
00:21:29.253 --> 00:21:30.753
You guys should be careful too.

269
00:21:30.753 --> 00:21:33.893
That guy with a perm is looking all over the place for you guys.

270
00:21:34.092 --> 00:21:35.332
It's them.

271
00:21:35.332 --> 00:21:36.993
Sang Hwan, what should we do?

272
00:21:36.993 --> 00:21:38.263
Was I correct?

273
00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:40.933
My gosh, I have such a good memory.

274
00:21:41.173 --> 00:21:42.372
Bye.

275
00:21:42.973 --> 00:21:45.643
I think they caught Jung Hoon and took him there.

276
00:21:45.643 --> 00:21:48.013
Please try to find out where he is.

277
00:21:53.643 --> 00:21:55.683
Why are you so surprised?

278
00:21:55.683 --> 00:21:57.082
No, it's nothing.

279
00:21:59.522 --> 00:22:01.253
I'll be off then.

280
00:22:01.292 --> 00:22:02.292
Okay.

281
00:22:11.733 --> 00:22:16.003
I have a talent in finding hidden things.

282

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

283
00:22:42.285 --> 00:22:44.384
My gosh, I can't believe this guy.

284
00:23:17.795 --> 00:23:18.925
Hey, Dong Cheol.

285
00:23:20.324 --> 00:23:21.465
Really?

286
00:23:22.295 --> 00:23:23.364
Okay.

287
00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:25.134
Let's go.

288
00:23:25.134 --> 00:23:26.864
These guys really aren't humans.

289
00:23:28.265 --> 00:23:29.304
Wait.

290
00:23:47.985 --> 00:23:49.884
Sang Hwan, you should drive more carefully.

291
00:23:49.884 --> 00:23:51.054
Hey, let me borrow your car.

292
00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:52.255
What are you talking about?

293
00:23:52.495 --> 00:23:54.465
- Hurry. - Thanks.

294
00:23:54.564 --> 00:23:56.725
What went wrong this time?

295
00:23:57.195 --> 00:23:58.465
You guys are unbelievable.

296
00:23:59.894 --> 00:24:01.664
Do you think I work at a car rental center?

297
00:24:02.404 --> 00:24:03.404
Thanks.

298
00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:05.074
My gosh.

299
00:24:09.475 --> 00:24:11.114
What's going on?

300
00:24:41.705 --> 00:24:43.175
Bring me some tools.

301
00:25:09.334 --> 00:25:11.334
- Are you ready? - Yes.

302
00:25:12.074 --> 00:25:13.374
I'll be back.

303
00:25:37.425 --> 00:25:38.435
I mean, seriously.

304
00:25:38.795 --> 00:25:43.064
I'm always doing all the dirty stuff for Guseonwon.

305
00:25:43.435 --> 00:25:46.175
How dare she try to kick me out when she should be thanking me?

306
00:25:47.904 --> 00:25:51.215
Those who repay people's kindness with betrayal...

307
00:25:51.215 --> 00:25:53.545
are monsters, not humans.

308
00:25:59.985 --> 00:26:01.285
Gosh, my back hurts.

309
00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:04.725
Wan Deok! Hey, Wan Deok!

310
00:26:05.354 --> 00:26:08.195
That's deep enough. You can bury him now.

311
00:26:16.164 --> 00:26:17.475
My gosh.

312
00:26:21.475 --> 00:26:22.604
That's right.

313
00:26:24.945 --> 00:26:26.245
I'm hungry.

314
00:26:26.715 --> 00:26:29.215
Let's go eat sundaeguk. I'm hungry.

315
00:26:37.624 --> 00:26:39.824
From here, we have to go this way,

316
00:26:40.525 --> 00:26:41.864
and turn left.

317
00:26:49.164 --> 00:26:51.175
This place is creepy at night.

318
00:26:51.975 --> 00:26:53.175
We need to stay alert.

319
00:26:56.104 --> 00:26:57.205
Let's go.

320
00:27:26.705 --> 00:27:29.804
Do you know who she is?

321
00:27:31.144 --> 00:27:32.215
Yes.

322
00:27:33.015 --> 00:27:36.045
She's my helper.

323
00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:39.185
No. She's no longer...

324
00:27:39.354 --> 00:27:42.884
the helper you thought she was.

325
00:27:44.324 --> 00:27:46.295
She's a devil...

326
00:27:46.695 --> 00:27:48.265
who's trying to destroy your soul.

327
00:27:49.495 --> 00:27:50.695
Did you...

328
00:27:51.535 --> 00:27:54.235
get blinded by this woman?

329
00:27:57.435 --> 00:27:58.675
No.

330
00:27:58.675 --> 00:28:02.275
You must always tell the truth to Spiritual Father.

331
00:28:03.175 --> 00:28:04.445
Do you understand?

332
00:28:05.914 --> 00:28:07.045
Yes.

333
00:28:07.914 --> 00:28:09.084
What did...

334
00:28:09.884 --> 00:28:13.185
she say to you while she was with you?

335
00:28:14.054 --> 00:28:16.324
She didn't say anything.

336
00:28:16.955 --> 00:28:20.124
She only delivered Apostle Kang's messages to me.

337
00:28:20.925 --> 00:28:23.295
Did you know that she is a reporter...

338
00:28:24.495 --> 00:28:26.864
who's getting controlled by the devil?

339
00:28:29.834 --> 00:28:31.205
No.

340
00:28:31.735 --> 00:28:33.904
We must get rid of every single devil...

341
00:28:34.904 --> 00:28:36.904
in Guseonwon.

342
00:28:37.144 --> 00:28:38.344
I believe it.

343
00:28:43.685 --> 00:28:44.914
If you...

344
00:28:46.854 --> 00:28:48.985
really did not get blinded by her,

345
00:28:50.084 --> 00:28:51.554
you should...

346
00:28:52.425 --> 00:28:55.525
carry out a fire prayer for her.

347
00:28:56.295 --> 00:28:58.594
Please save me.

348
00:28:58.594 --> 00:29:00.664
I don't know anything.

349
00:29:05.505 --> 00:29:07.644
Please do not get fooled by the devil.

350
00:29:08.205 --> 00:29:11.374
The devil always approaches us in the most...

351
00:29:12.445 --> 00:29:13.874
pitiful form...

352
00:29:15.515 --> 00:29:17.884
and uses that as a scheme...

353
00:29:18.354 --> 00:29:19.715
to weaken our hearts.

354
00:29:20.314 --> 00:29:22.654
Sang Mi, hurry up and kick the devil out of here.

355
00:29:22.925 --> 00:29:24.195
You can do it.

356
00:29:24.755 --> 00:29:26.995
You even prayed passionately...

357
00:29:27.255 --> 00:29:29.765
to our Almighty a while ago.

358
00:29:30.624 --> 00:29:33.995
Sang Mi, you need to run away.

359
00:29:34.705 --> 00:29:36.164
Can you see?

360
00:29:37.005 --> 00:29:39.604
There are so many devils hiding in this place.

361
00:29:40.304 --> 00:29:42.245
Sang Mi, hurry up.

362
00:29:43.074 --> 00:29:44.715
Your mother...

363
00:29:45.374 --> 00:29:47.215
also wants you to...

364
00:29:47.215 --> 00:29:48.914
You dirty...

365
00:29:51.685 --> 00:29:53.215
devil!

366
00:29:53.814 --> 00:29:54.955
Get lost!

367
00:29:55.225 --> 00:29:57.455
No, that's not me.

368
00:29:58.624 --> 00:30:01.164
I'm not a devil.

369
00:30:01.495 --> 00:30:03.765
With the fire of our Almighty...

370
00:30:04.965 --> 00:30:07.465
With his hot fire,

371
00:30:08.664 --> 00:30:10.765
I command you, the dirty devil,

372
00:30:12.275 --> 00:30:14.175
to get lost!

373
00:30:32.455 --> 00:30:33.854
You cannot come in here.

374
00:30:36.364 --> 00:30:40.834
No, it's just that I saw a few weird guys secretly coming in here.

375
00:30:41.465 --> 00:30:42.735
Who are you talking about?

376
00:30:43.404 --> 00:30:45.175
They seemed like my age.

377
00:30:45.334 --> 00:30:48.104
One was tall, and the other one was a bit chubby.

378
00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:50.505
I saw them going over to the storage in the woods.

379
00:31:04.554 --> 00:31:06.324
- We need to go right now. - What?

380
00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:10.094
- They're here. - Who's here?

381
00:31:10.094 --> 00:31:12.094
Those guys who took Sang Mi.

382
00:31:12.435 --> 00:31:13.465
Where are they right now?

383
00:31:13.465 --> 00:31:14.864
They went to the prayer room in the woods.

384
00:31:15.664 --> 00:31:17.134
What? The prayer room?

385
00:31:19.104 --> 00:31:20.604
Follow me. Hurry up.

386
00:31:26.945 --> 00:31:29.545
Jung Hoon. Jung Hoon.

387
00:31:31.654 --> 00:31:32.884
Jung Hoon.

388
00:31:33.485 --> 00:31:34.725
Jung Hoon.

389
00:31:39.495 --> 00:31:40.654
Jung Hoon.

390
00:31:40.654 --> 00:31:42.064
Is that him?

391
00:31:42.064 --> 00:31:43.364
Jung Hoon.

392
00:31:48.834 --> 00:31:50.064
Move over.

393
00:31:56.945 --> 00:31:58.344
Jung Hoon.

394
00:32:01.344 --> 00:32:03.314
Jung Hoon, are you okay?

395
00:32:11.295 --> 00:32:13.295
- Hurry up! - Wait, wait.

396
00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:16.394
Let's go this way.

397
00:32:28.874 --> 00:32:30.144
Darn it.

398
00:32:40.255 --> 00:32:42.725
I see those punks.

399
00:32:52.235 --> 00:32:53.334
Be careful.

400
00:32:54.235 --> 00:32:55.334
Are you okay?

401
00:32:59.175 --> 00:33:02.005
Here! I caught them!

402
00:33:02.505 --> 00:33:03.904
What are you doing?

403
00:33:03.904 --> 00:33:05.545
Hurry up, and punch me.

404
00:33:05.545 --> 00:33:07.844
Over here! Hurry up!

405
00:33:16.255 --> 00:33:18.224
You demons!

406
00:33:27.034 --> 00:33:28.604
Stop them!

407
00:33:29.064 --> 00:33:30.264
Get them!

408
00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:32.704
Hey!

409
00:33:40.545 --> 00:33:42.545
Jung Hoon, are you okay?

410
00:33:43.485 --> 00:33:45.385
I'm all right.

411
00:33:45.555 --> 00:33:46.755
They will...

412
00:33:47.584 --> 00:33:50.854
mess up everyone in Muji if we don't stop them.

413
00:33:56.295 --> 00:33:57.494
I'm so grateful...

414
00:33:58.834 --> 00:33:59.894
that I have you guys.

415
00:34:06.204 --> 00:34:07.874
By the way,

416
00:34:08.345 --> 00:34:13.575
how did you say you saw those young men?

417
00:34:14.514 --> 00:34:18.584
Well, I was on my way to the prayer room in the woods,

418
00:34:18.885 --> 00:34:21.354
and I saw some strange boys passing by.

419
00:34:22.055 --> 00:34:24.255
I just thought they might be the ones.

420
00:34:24.494 --> 00:34:27.925
Gosh, you did a really good thing.

421
00:34:28.025 --> 00:34:29.064
You're amazing.

422
00:34:29.064 --> 00:34:30.724
Not at all.

423
00:34:30.994 --> 00:34:33.295
It must have been dark in the woods.

424
00:34:33.534 --> 00:34:36.704
How did you know they were the ones right away?

425
00:34:38.834 --> 00:34:40.405
I heard their voices.

426
00:34:40.534 --> 00:34:43.305
They said something about getting someone out,

427
00:34:43.305 --> 00:34:46.244
and how they should be careful of this cult.

428
00:34:46.244 --> 00:34:48.115
I heard things like that.

429
00:34:48.244 --> 00:34:50.414
They're acting like they're the truth when they're fake.

430
00:34:50.445 --> 00:34:52.684
We should not be deceived by things like that.

431
00:34:53.454 --> 00:34:57.525
That is why we pray and have worship every day.

432
00:34:57.954 --> 00:34:59.925
- Our wishes will be fulfilled. - I believe it.

433
00:34:59.925 --> 00:35:01.164
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

434
00:35:06.764 --> 00:35:11.505
Almighty sent a precious soul to us today.

435
00:35:12.104 --> 00:35:13.235
He is...

436
00:35:14.704 --> 00:35:16.474
a blessed gatekeeper of Guseonwon.

437
00:35:17.144 --> 00:35:18.514
Am I?

438
00:35:19.374 --> 00:35:20.514
Congratulations.

439
00:35:21.215 --> 00:35:23.345
You have been given a gracious duty.

440
00:35:23.445 --> 00:35:24.514
I'm sorry?

441
00:35:26.184 --> 00:35:27.624
Thank you.

442
00:35:33.994 --> 00:35:38.295
Now, Apostle Im should take Spiritual Mother and go.

443
00:35:38.865 --> 00:35:42.965
Apostle Kang, please prepare the night worship with Dong Cheol.

444
00:35:43.664 --> 00:35:44.805
Yes, Spiritual Father.

445
00:36:04.624 --> 00:36:05.795
Please wait.

446
00:36:07.195 --> 00:36:08.295
What is it?

447
00:36:08.525 --> 00:36:12.494
I just received a divine revelation from Almighty.

448
00:36:13.764 --> 00:36:17.905
He says we shouldn't just send away the one who fought with the demons.

449
00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:25.275
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

450
00:36:25.545 --> 00:36:26.715
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

451
00:36:30.644 --> 00:36:33.354
Dad, please give me Living Water.

452
00:36:33.354 --> 00:36:34.354
Sure.

453
00:36:51.235 --> 00:36:54.744
All of them.

454
00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:02.184
Thank you.

455
00:37:02.985 --> 00:37:03.985
Sure.

456
00:37:12.155 --> 00:37:13.325
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

457
00:37:13.494 --> 00:37:14.525
Our wishes will be fulfilled.

458
00:37:16.525 --> 00:37:17.564
Let's go.

459
00:37:22.034 --> 00:37:23.805
Why didn't you tell me?

460
00:37:24.474 --> 00:37:28.244
Why did you do something unnecessary and make those demons...

461
00:37:28.445 --> 00:37:31.115
come inside of Guseonwon?

462
00:37:31.115 --> 00:37:32.275
Why?

463
00:37:33.374 --> 00:37:34.885
Don't ask me.

464
00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:38.055
You should just ask Almighty directly.

465
00:37:41.385 --> 00:37:44.055
What do you mean by that?

466
00:37:44.055 --> 00:37:46.425
I'm saying this is all because of you.

467
00:37:46.425 --> 00:37:48.764
They're digging up your past...

468
00:37:48.764 --> 00:37:51.334
and broadcasting it on the internet.

469
00:37:54.164 --> 00:37:56.264
It will complicate things.

470
00:37:56.264 --> 00:37:58.005
I think it's time to leave this place.

471
00:37:58.005 --> 00:37:59.635
It's a small town,

472
00:37:59.635 --> 00:38:03.045
and we've been here for about five years. That's enough.

473
00:38:03.045 --> 00:38:06.445
They're doing this because of Sang Mi anyway.

474
00:38:06.814 --> 00:38:08.885
Let's let her go...

475
00:38:08.885 --> 00:38:11.084
and leave this place quietly, okay?

476
00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.985
It might cause us bigger trouble...

477
00:38:13.284 --> 00:38:15.784
if the police get involved.

478
00:38:15.784 --> 00:38:17.994
Sang Mi and I will soon have our spiritual wedding...

479
00:38:17.994 --> 00:38:20.655
where she will become our Spiritual Mother.

480
00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:23.965
Until then, please don't cause any more problems.

481
00:38:23.965 --> 00:38:26.195
Darn it, are you insane?

482
00:38:26.195 --> 00:38:29.135
If you want to mess around with her, just do it right now!

483
00:38:30.564 --> 00:38:34.445
Why are you obsessing so much about Sang Mi?

484
00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:37.374
If you need a girl, just tell me.

485
00:38:37.374 --> 00:38:39.014
Among the believers, I will...

486
00:38:39.014 --> 00:38:40.814
It looks like...

487
00:38:42.215 --> 00:38:44.045
Apostle Kang was right.

488
00:38:45.014 --> 00:38:48.985
She said demons have filled up this place at some point.

489
00:38:51.555 --> 00:38:53.295
Are you talking about me?

490
00:39:00.034 --> 00:39:01.934
Those who have lost their faith...

491
00:39:02.235 --> 00:39:04.474
are no longer the children of Almighty.

492
00:39:06.175 --> 00:39:07.334
Apostle Jo.

493
00:39:08.445 --> 00:39:09.445
Please...

494
00:39:10.575 --> 00:39:11.874
leave us now.

495
00:39:16.115 --> 00:39:17.115
What?

496
00:39:18.485 --> 00:39:20.655
I've been treating you like you're really the Spiritual Father,

497
00:39:21.184 --> 00:39:22.985
and you've gone insane.

498
00:39:26.224 --> 00:39:27.595
You lunatic.

499
00:39:28.965 --> 00:39:31.894
You've been convicted of fraud eight times. Prisoner 6100,

500
00:39:31.894 --> 00:39:34.965
that's who you really are, you crazy jerk.

501
00:39:35.365 --> 00:39:37.805
You creeped and crawled to me like a dog.

502
00:39:38.505 --> 00:39:41.005
Have you forgotten it?

503
00:39:53.454 --> 00:39:54.454
Hit me.

504
00:39:57.555 --> 00:39:58.954
Hit me with it.

505
00:40:03.325 --> 00:40:05.334
If you hit me,

506
00:40:05.695 --> 00:40:10.735
do you think you will get everything you want?

507
00:40:18.914 --> 00:40:21.945
The prisoner you knew in the past...

508
00:40:23.615 --> 00:40:25.184
died already.

509
00:40:36.264 --> 00:40:37.264
I am...

510
00:40:39.235 --> 00:40:42.534
the father of all spirits who will lead you...

511
00:40:44.934 --> 00:40:46.575
to the paradise.

512
00:40:51.945 --> 00:40:53.244
Do you understand?

513
00:41:10.525 --> 00:41:12.795
Don't let what happened today bother you,

514
00:41:13.034 --> 00:41:14.534
and pray harder.

515
00:41:22.204 --> 00:41:23.275
Dad.

516
00:41:24.814 --> 00:41:25.814
Yes?

517
00:41:26.175 --> 00:41:29.445
Please let me see Mom.

518
00:41:31.784 --> 00:41:33.014
I can't.

519
00:41:33.755 --> 00:41:37.184
You're not supposed to see her during your training.

520
00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:42.595
Almighty showed me his divine revelation.

521
00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:45.764
What?

522
00:41:46.764 --> 00:41:48.704
Is that true?

523
00:41:48.704 --> 00:41:49.764
Yes.

524
00:41:50.934 --> 00:41:54.675
Almighty came to my dream last night.

525
00:41:56.175 --> 00:41:58.974
He said I have to be with her when I pray for her.

526
00:41:59.144 --> 00:42:02.414
If I do, she will be free from her illness,

527
00:42:02.414 --> 00:42:04.684
and I will truly become Spiritual Mother.

528
00:42:11.325 --> 00:42:13.155
Excuse me, Apostle Kang.

529
00:42:14.195 --> 00:42:15.494
What is it?

530
00:42:15.795 --> 00:42:17.124
May I use the toilet?

531
00:42:18.034 --> 00:42:20.764
My stomach hurts probably because I'm relaxed now.

532
00:42:21.264 --> 00:42:22.534
Apostle Kang.

533
00:42:23.164 --> 00:42:25.735
You need to lead the chant now.

534
00:42:26.034 --> 00:42:29.104
Shall I tell everyone to pray for a little while if you're busy?

535
00:42:29.945 --> 00:42:30.945
No, it's okay.

536
00:42:31.945 --> 00:42:34.115
- You may go. - Thank you.

537
00:42:34.414 --> 00:42:35.814
- Let's go upstairs. - Okay.

538
00:42:49.724 --> 00:42:52.235
They abducted him and beat him up.

539
00:42:52.465 --> 00:42:54.805
- Are you sure about that? - Can't you tell?

540
00:42:58.905 --> 00:43:00.945
Why did you bring him to me instead of taking him to the hospital?

541
00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:03.345
Those jerks can show up at the hospital here anytime.

542
00:43:03.604 --> 00:43:06.244
We'll take him to the city, but we want to ask you for a favor first.

543
00:43:06.914 --> 00:43:10.615
They abduct, confine, and beat people up to death.

544
00:43:10.744 --> 00:43:14.425
I need to get my friends out of there as soon as possible.

545
00:43:15.584 --> 00:43:16.985
The police need to get involved.

546
00:43:18.325 --> 00:43:19.795
I told you the other day.

547
00:43:20.394 --> 00:43:22.164
You guys are probably too young to understand, but...

548
00:43:22.164 --> 00:43:24.365
Don't blame others. Can't you just try?

549
00:43:24.465 --> 00:43:26.465
- What? - Stop blaming the lack of evidence,

550
00:43:26.465 --> 00:43:28.905
the hierarchy, and the fact that it's a religious organization.

551
00:43:28.905 --> 00:43:31.534
Even a dead body has been found. When will the police get involved?

552
00:43:32.474 --> 00:43:34.244
Gosh, you punks drive me crazy.

553
00:43:35.005 --> 00:43:38.744
Chief needs to meet with Mr. Han first in order to take any action.

554
00:43:39.014 --> 00:43:43.244
In Muji, no one can do anything without your dad's permission.

555
00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:46.954
We'll take him to a hospital and get a medical report first.

556
00:43:46.954 --> 00:43:49.454
They committed assault, coercion, abduction, and confinement.

557
00:43:49.454 --> 00:43:51.695
We'll press charges against them for everything they've done.

558
00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:55.865
My dad won't be able to stop me if the media takes interest in it.

559
00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:57.425
I'll make that happen.

560
00:43:57.894 --> 00:44:01.005
So please. You have to do something about it.

561
00:44:02.505 --> 00:44:05.604
It'll turn into a pretty big case once the media becomes interested.

562
00:44:05.704 --> 00:44:08.104
If you help us out, all of your work will eventually...

563
00:44:08.575 --> 00:44:10.104
get recognized, don't you think?

564
00:44:12.374 --> 00:44:14.885
You're right. I should move back to Seoul.

565
00:44:16.084 --> 00:44:17.584
Sure, let's take action.

566
00:44:17.784 --> 00:44:20.115
Gosh, I'm so sick and tired of this place.

567
00:44:20.514 --> 00:44:21.655
We'll get going then.

568
00:44:29.095 --> 00:44:30.425
- Sang Hwan. - Yes.

569
00:44:31.934 --> 00:44:34.434
You should take Jung Hoon to a hospital.

570
00:44:34.564 --> 00:44:36.704
I want to try...

571
00:44:37.204 --> 00:44:39.534
talking to my dad one last time.

572
00:44:39.534 --> 00:44:42.604
Sang Hwan, what will you do with your dad?

573
00:44:42.775 --> 00:44:45.945
If he continues to try to stop the investigation,

574
00:44:47.075 --> 00:44:49.215
I'll have no choice but to press charges against him.

575
00:44:50.345 --> 00:44:53.814
A son pressing charges against his father will hopefully make...

576
00:44:54.624 --> 00:44:56.155
people and the media become interested.

577
00:45:30.284 --> 00:45:32.595
Dong Cheol, Jung Hoon is fine.

578
00:45:32.595 --> 00:45:35.795
I'll raid that place with the police tomorrow no matter what,

579
00:45:35.795 --> 00:45:38.295
so I hope you and Sang Mi can stay strong until then.

580
00:45:47.235 --> 00:45:48.474
Sang Mi.

581
00:45:50.244 --> 00:45:51.414
Sang Mi.

582
00:45:53.615 --> 00:45:54.814
Honey.

583
00:45:56.284 --> 00:45:57.655
Sang Mi is here...

584
00:45:58.314 --> 00:46:00.755
to pray for you.

585
00:46:01.655 --> 00:46:03.755
To pray for me?

586
00:46:08.025 --> 00:46:09.224
Mom.

587
00:46:10.224 --> 00:46:11.735
Don't worry about anything.

588
00:46:14.635 --> 00:46:18.575
Of course. I'm in the paradise.

589
00:46:20.104 --> 00:46:21.204
That's right.

590
00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:23.175
This place...

591
00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:25.644
is the paradise.

592
00:46:37.155 --> 00:46:40.025
Oh, no. This is priceless.

593
00:46:41.325 --> 00:46:43.025
You should've been careful.

594
00:46:43.724 --> 00:46:44.865
I'm sorry.

595
00:46:45.494 --> 00:46:49.604
Dad, can you get me another vile of Living Water?

596
00:46:51.005 --> 00:46:54.474
All right. I'll be right back.

597
00:46:54.805 --> 00:46:56.675
Honey, you and Sang Mi should...

598
00:46:58.575 --> 00:47:01.885
I mean, Spiritual Mother. You should stay with her here.

599
00:47:02.514 --> 00:47:03.684
Okay?

600
00:47:10.784 --> 00:47:11.854
Sang Mi.

601
00:47:12.624 --> 00:47:14.164
Are you really okay?

602
00:47:15.494 --> 00:47:16.595
Yes.

603
00:47:17.325 --> 00:47:18.595
I'm fine.

604
00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:22.164
This must be so hard for you.

605
00:47:24.064 --> 00:47:25.235
I'm sorry.

606
00:47:26.505 --> 00:47:29.945
I should've come to my senses a lot sooner.

607
00:47:32.374 --> 00:47:35.345
Don't say that. It's not your fault.

608
00:47:36.184 --> 00:47:38.055
Those people made you like this.

609
00:47:38.914 --> 00:47:41.084
Now, we need to take them down.

610
00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:43.224
So please...

611
00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:47.354
Try to stay strong for just a little longer, okay?

612
00:47:48.994 --> 00:47:51.764
What can you do by yourself though?

613
00:47:52.494 --> 00:47:53.635
Mom.

614
00:47:54.534 --> 00:47:56.064
I'm not doing this alone.

615
00:47:57.365 --> 00:48:00.135
I have friends who are helping me.

616
00:48:01.575 --> 00:48:02.905
And I'm not weak.

617
00:48:04.775 --> 00:48:06.215
I'm your daughter, you know.

618
00:48:07.244 --> 00:48:08.644
I'm strong, just like you.

619
00:48:11.414 --> 00:48:12.584
So...

620
00:48:13.854 --> 00:48:15.255
don't worry too much, okay?

621
00:49:22.124 --> 00:49:23.325
Dad.

622
00:49:24.425 --> 00:49:25.425
Yes?

623
00:49:25.755 --> 00:49:27.295
I need to use the washroom quickly.

624
00:49:28.425 --> 00:49:31.465
All right. I'll wait for you outside.

625
00:49:31.834 --> 00:49:32.865
Okay.

626
00:50:08.264 --> 00:50:09.704
Is it you, Dong Cheol?

627
00:50:10.664 --> 00:50:12.505
Yes, it's me.

628
00:50:13.534 --> 00:50:16.505
Those jerks brought the reporter here,

629
00:50:17.305 --> 00:50:18.974
but I'm not sure where they took her.

630
00:50:19.244 --> 00:50:21.345
Is there any place that comes to your mind?

631
00:50:26.314 --> 00:50:27.854
I think I know where they took her.

632
00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:30.255
In the basement, there's a separate ward...

633
00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:33.325
where they confine patients that have caused problems.

634
00:50:34.925 --> 00:50:37.795
All right. I'll go down there.

635
00:50:49.445 --> 00:50:52.575
Gosh, why are there so many flies here?

636
00:50:53.974 --> 00:50:56.115
Hey, don't you dare!

637
00:50:59.485 --> 00:51:03.354
All right, everyone. Do you know where I am now?

638
00:51:03.354 --> 00:51:06.624
You remember the scary, shocking video I recently uploaded...

639
00:51:06.624 --> 00:51:08.224
about the cult leader, right?

640
00:51:08.224 --> 00:51:11.635
I'm back at their building. Look.

641
00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:14.965
It's called Guseonwon.

642
00:51:15.735 --> 00:51:19.604
Look at this. It's so spooky here.

643
00:51:19.604 --> 00:51:23.345
This place totally gives you the creeps. That car is...

644
00:51:23.345 --> 00:51:24.945
It's a police car.

645
00:51:25.175 --> 00:51:27.985
Guys, I better hide now.

646
00:51:30.045 --> 00:51:32.954
All right. The car is coming closer.

647
00:51:33.115 --> 00:51:37.255
Both the police car and the other car stopped.

648
00:51:37.385 --> 00:51:40.025
Let's see. We should see what happens.

649
00:51:40.224 --> 00:51:41.295
My gosh, Sergeant Woo.

650
00:51:41.295 --> 00:51:44.434
- Hello, how have you been? - Good. You're working so hard.

651
00:51:45.834 --> 00:51:47.394
- Just a second, please. - Sure.

652
00:51:47.635 --> 00:51:49.934
Gosh, you didn't have to get me anything.

653
00:51:50.204 --> 00:51:51.874
You have to stay healthy...

654
00:51:51.874 --> 00:51:54.905
to provide for your wife and son. Aren't I right?

655
00:51:54.905 --> 00:51:57.715
I can't keep accepting things like this.

656
00:51:57.715 --> 00:52:01.985
Why? Don't worry. No one knows, and no one will find out.

657
00:52:06.255 --> 00:52:08.885
How dare you! Goodness.

658
00:52:16.164 --> 00:52:18.934
Gosh, you sure have gotten gutsy.

659
00:52:20.494 --> 00:52:21.905
Did you run away from home or what?

660
00:52:22.264 --> 00:52:24.064
- Dad. - What?

661
00:52:24.635 --> 00:52:27.005
When will you come home?

662
00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:31.615
You should come home. Do you love your friends that much?

663
00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:33.775
I'll go home today.

664
00:52:33.775 --> 00:52:35.045
Why did you call me?

665
00:52:38.385 --> 00:52:39.684
Because I missed you.

666
00:52:43.954 --> 00:52:45.525
He said he missed me.

667
00:52:47.965 --> 00:52:49.925
Cut it out. You're making me cringe.

668
00:52:49.925 --> 00:52:52.534
Stop missing me. You should spend that time to study hard.

669
00:52:52.534 --> 00:52:54.635
That's how you can be a good son.

670
00:52:55.135 --> 00:52:56.204
You got that?

671
00:52:56.564 --> 00:52:57.805
Jung Hoon.

672
00:52:59.005 --> 00:53:00.005
Yes.

673
00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:04.644
- That silly boy. - My gosh.

674
00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:12.814
Jung Hoon.

675
00:53:13.385 --> 00:53:14.655
I'll take you to a hospital now.

676
00:53:16.724 --> 00:53:18.825
All right. Let's go.

677
00:53:29.635 --> 00:53:32.305
You probably want to say that this place is fake,

678
00:53:33.204 --> 00:53:35.204
but it's real.

679
00:53:36.505 --> 00:53:38.414
I'll make it real.

680
00:53:41.414 --> 00:53:43.084
Sister So Rin,

681
00:53:44.954 --> 00:53:46.814
this injection will make you...

682
00:53:48.954 --> 00:53:51.295
believe that this place is the paradise.

683
00:53:53.595 --> 00:53:55.525
So don't worry about anything, okay?

684
00:54:02.064 --> 00:54:03.135
Why are you here?

685
00:54:04.065 --> 00:54:06.406
believe that this place is the paradise.

686
00:54:10.105 --> 00:54:11.175
Why are you here?

687
00:54:13.534 --> 00:54:15.375
What are you doing now?

688
00:54:35.965 --> 00:54:37.164
Are you all right?

689
00:54:40.264 --> 00:54:43.105
If you go that way into the forest,

690
00:54:43.105 --> 00:54:45.074
you'll get to a stream with a small bridge.

691
00:54:45.875 --> 00:54:48.074
You can meet my friend there and get help from him.

692
00:54:48.505 --> 00:54:50.105
I'll give him a call now.

693
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:51.514
His name is Han Sang Hwan.

694
00:54:51.645 --> 00:54:53.344
What about you and Sang Mi?

695
00:54:54.384 --> 00:54:57.184
We'll take everyone here with us.

696
00:54:57.884 --> 00:55:00.884
You need to get out of here and tell the whole world about this place.

697
00:55:01.755 --> 00:55:02.824
Okay.

698
00:55:03.724 --> 00:55:04.925
Be careful, okay?

699
00:55:05.655 --> 00:55:07.195
I promise you I'll come back.

700
00:55:07.324 --> 00:55:08.364
All right.

701
00:55:28.414 --> 00:55:29.485
Hey, Dong Cheol.

702
00:55:29.485 --> 00:55:30.684
Is Jung Hoon okay?

703
00:55:30.715 --> 00:55:31.755
Yes.

704
00:55:31.985 --> 00:55:34.784
Man Hee took him to the hospital, so he'll be fine.

705
00:55:34.855 --> 00:55:35.985
What about you guys?

706
00:55:36.454 --> 00:55:37.485
We're okay too.

707
00:55:38.755 --> 00:55:40.355
Sang Hwan. By the way,

708
00:55:40.795 --> 00:55:43.525
I need you to go to Muji Creek right now.

709
00:55:43.664 --> 00:55:45.895
Muji Creek? Really?

710
00:55:46.094 --> 00:55:49.034
I helped the reporter escape, and she's on her way there now.

711
00:55:49.304 --> 00:55:52.175
Take her to Eun Sung's place so that she can hide there.

712
00:55:52.434 --> 00:55:55.375
Okay. I'll leave right now.

713
00:55:55.405 --> 00:55:56.474
Dong Cheol.

714
00:55:56.545 --> 00:55:57.545
What is it?

715
00:55:57.545 --> 00:56:00.715
We'll raid that place with the police tomorrow.

716
00:56:00.815 --> 00:56:03.344
This time, we have evidence because Jung Hoon got beaten up.

717
00:56:03.344 --> 00:56:04.684
They won't be able to get out of it.

718
00:56:04.715 --> 00:56:07.014
You just need to hold out tonight.

719
00:56:07.155 --> 00:56:08.184
All right.

720
00:56:08.925 --> 00:56:10.355
You be careful too.

721
00:56:10.884 --> 00:56:13.054
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

722
00:57:13.085 --> 00:57:16.855
Almighty must love me very much.

723
00:57:17.925 --> 00:57:20.755
I mean, who thought I'd run into you right here?

724
00:57:21.364 --> 00:57:23.425
Aren't I right, Reporter Hong So Rin?

725
00:58:04.134 --> 00:58:05.434
Yes, hello?

726
00:58:06.974 --> 00:58:08.005
Sang...

727
00:58:09.045 --> 00:58:10.275
Hwan.

728
00:58:11.945 --> 00:58:12.974
Mom?

729
00:58:13.344 --> 00:58:16.784
Yes, it's me.

730
00:58:33.195 --> 00:58:35.905
(Save Me)

731
00:58:36.434 --> 00:58:38.474
Mom, Mom.

732
00:58:41.704 --> 00:58:44.715
Mom, did you move on your own?

733
00:58:59.395 --> 00:59:00.554
Mom.

734
00:59:03.925 --> 00:59:07.295
Your dad...

735
00:59:08.905 --> 00:59:10.804
Where is he?
