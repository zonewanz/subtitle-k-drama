1
00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.394
Yes, I can't live like this.

2
00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:22.765
I came back to my reality,

3
00:00:22.894 --> 00:00:24.765
and I finally became a police officer too.

4
00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:28.035
But without Soo Jin, my life is meaningless.

5
00:00:40.214 --> 00:00:41.214
Soo Jin.

6
00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:43.255
I will turn everything around.

7
00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:45.484
I will change this no matter what it takes...

8
00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:47.055
to get you back.

9
00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:00.174
What?

10
00:01:07.244 --> 00:01:08.244
What is this?

11
00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:10.845
Where did the manhole go?

12
00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:12.744
What's...

13
00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:18.854
What's going on?

14
00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:39.774
What's going on?

15
00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:43.684
Who did this? Who?

16
00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:45.585
Who did this and why?

17
00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:50.654
Where did the manhole go?

18
00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:52.624
He must be crazy.

19
00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:54.854
Don't go near him. There are a lot of weird people.

20
00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:18.184
It's past midnight.

21
00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:22.955
Does this mean I can't get in there anymore?

22
00:02:26.024 --> 00:02:31.825
(Episode 12, Love, the unknown)

23
00:02:33.564 --> 00:02:35.494
I decided on her.

24
00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:41.374
We have the same taste in a daughter-in-law.

25
00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:43.675
I liked her the best too.

26
00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:45.504
I'm glad...

27
00:02:45.904 --> 00:02:47.145
you like her too.

28
00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:49.175
She looks so nice,

29
00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.485
and she works at a bank, so she has a secure job.

30
00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:53.385
And both her parents are in education,

31
00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:55.485
so I'm sure she was brought up very well.

32
00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:57.555
Above all, I love how she wants to have...

33
00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:59.284
children as soon as possible.

34
00:02:59.284 --> 00:03:01.994
I mean, it's about time we had grandchildren.

35
00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:03.055
You're right.

36
00:03:03.594 --> 00:03:06.194
If anything, Pil is one good looking kid,

37
00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:09.594
so I'm sure our grandchild will be good looking too.

38
00:03:09.594 --> 00:03:11.404
And look at her, she's way above average.

39
00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:13.064
Their kids will be really pretty.

40
00:03:13.064 --> 00:03:15.434
I'm already looking forward to seeing them.

41
00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:17.944
Hey, Pil.

42
00:03:17.944 --> 00:03:19.545
- Look at this photo... - No.

43
00:03:21.774 --> 00:03:24.844
Fine. I won't see you either.

44
00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:27.955
I'll never see you again, you brat.

45
00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:30.055
My goodness.

46
00:03:40.635 --> 00:03:42.194
Wait.

47
00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:44.934
(Manholes that disappeared.)

48
00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:46.305
(Your search did not match anything.)

49
00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:53.045
(Replacing manholes)

50
00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:56.015
(Eunha-gu replaces and removes faulty manholes.)

51
00:03:58.045 --> 00:03:59.515
Nothing comes up.

52
00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:01.855
I need to find out why it's gone,

53
00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:03.624
so I can come up with a plan.

54
00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:05.925
Goodness.

55
00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:09.325
Who manages the manholes?

56
00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:13.094
Yes, the borough office.

57
00:04:13.964 --> 00:04:17.934
That's right. Seok Tae works there.

58
00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:30.485
Hi, what's up?

59
00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:33.215
Hey, Seok Tae. I need to ask you...

60
00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:36.555
about the manholes in my neighborhood.

61
00:04:36.624 --> 00:04:37.954
Can we talk?

62
00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:40.954
Don't you know I get off work at 6pm?

63
00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:43.295
Call during the office hours.

64
00:04:44.095 --> 00:04:46.124
Hey, Seok Tae. Hey!

65
00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:54.775
I have to wait until tomorrow.

66
00:04:56.605 --> 00:04:58.605
Darn it.

67
00:05:43.454 --> 00:05:44.684
I heard you went to the hospital.

68
00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:48.694
Yes. Did you hear it from the police officer?

69
00:05:48.925 --> 00:05:49.925
Yes.

70
00:05:50.425 --> 00:05:51.525
Jae Hyun.

71
00:05:52.295 --> 00:05:54.264
I'm going through so much because of you.

72
00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:56.805
I can't eat or sleep these days.

73
00:05:57.264 --> 00:05:58.465
I feel like I'm going to die...

74
00:05:58.465 --> 00:05:59.535
So?

75
00:06:00.105 --> 00:06:02.275
Will you bother me like this forever?

76
00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:03.305
Jae Hyun.

77
00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:06.045
Young Ju, I have a family.

78
00:06:06.715 --> 00:06:08.314
Please stop.

79
00:06:08.314 --> 00:06:09.615
Jae Hyun.

80
00:06:10.845 --> 00:06:12.415
Do you love her more than me?

81
00:06:13.184 --> 00:06:14.454
I know you don't.

82
00:06:15.084 --> 00:06:16.384
Jae Hyun.

83
00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:19.055
We have wonderful memories together.

84
00:06:20.454 --> 00:06:23.025
Did I make some kind of mistake?

85
00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:26.264
That's why you married her, isn't it?

86
00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:29.394
No. I really love my wife.

87
00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:31.665
You can't even imagine how much I love her.

88
00:06:31.965 --> 00:06:32.965
What?

89
00:06:32.965 --> 00:06:34.535
If you have the time to follow me around,

90
00:06:34.535 --> 00:06:36.004
use it to get treated.

91
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:37.944
Jae Hyun.

92
00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:17.715
If you want to park your car,

93
00:07:17.715 --> 00:07:18.845
be quiet and stay still.

94
00:07:44.644 --> 00:07:46.545
What are you thinking about?

95
00:07:46.845 --> 00:07:48.175
Did you have a good run?

96
00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:49.574
You're back early.

97
00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:51.584
Sit down. Let's have breakfast.

98
00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:52.845
Okay.

99
00:07:56.525 --> 00:07:58.824
Why did you prepare so much food?

100
00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:01.555
It's too much work for you. Keep it simple.

101
00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:04.425
No. You should have a hearty breakfast.

102
00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:06.025
I made squid soup. Your favorite.

103
00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:07.165
Try it.

104
00:08:13.334 --> 00:08:14.405
It's good.

105
00:08:24.814 --> 00:08:26.084
Why are you looking at me like that?

106
00:08:26.084 --> 00:08:28.055
What? It's nothing.

107
00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:30.225
I love watching you eat so deliciously.

108
00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:32.224
You should eat too.

109
00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:33.354
Okay.

110
00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:38.625
Wait. I don't have my cellphone.

111
00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:39.694
What?

112
00:08:40.094 --> 00:08:42.434
Did you leave it in the room?

113
00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:44.035
No, I had it with me.

114
00:08:44.305 --> 00:08:45.834
I had it in my pocket.

115
00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:49.074
I must've dropped it while I was jogging.

116
00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:51.045
I'll call your phone.

117
00:08:54.145 --> 00:08:55.814
- Your call is being... - Not picking up.

118
00:08:55.814 --> 00:08:56.984
forwarded to...

119
00:08:57.385 --> 00:08:59.745
Just leave it. I'll call it later.

120
00:08:59.745 --> 00:09:00.984
Let's eat.

121
00:09:01.214 --> 00:09:02.385
Okay.

122
00:09:11.895 --> 00:09:13.995
- Have a good day at work. - Thanks.

123
00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:16.934
- Drive safe. - Okay. Bye.

124
00:09:28.015 --> 00:09:30.714
This is Jae Hyun's number.

125
00:09:32.584 --> 00:09:33.684
Hello?

126
00:09:33.714 --> 00:09:36.155
Hello. Yes.

127
00:09:36.314 --> 00:09:38.454
I found this phone.

128
00:09:38.454 --> 00:09:40.255
I'm calling you because...

129
00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:41.995
this number showed up as the most recent call.

130
00:09:41.995 --> 00:09:44.925
It's my husband's phone. Thank you.

131
00:09:44.925 --> 00:09:47.035
I'll come pick it up now. Where are you?

132
00:09:49.934 --> 00:09:51.405
Where is she?

133
00:09:52.564 --> 00:09:55.204
Are you the one who lost your phone?

134
00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:56.329
Yes, it's me.

135
00:09:58.604 --> 00:09:59.675
Here.

136
00:10:01.314 --> 00:10:03.015
It was sitting on a bench.

137
00:10:03.015 --> 00:10:04.814
Thank you.

138
00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:06.415
How can I repay you?

139
00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:08.155
Don't worry about it.

140
00:10:08.484 --> 00:10:10.084
I live around here too.

141
00:10:10.224 --> 00:10:12.425
Neighbors should help each other.

142
00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:14.295
I see.

143
00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:17.765
I'll buy you lunch when I see you next time.

144
00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:19.025
All right.

145
00:10:20.135 --> 00:10:21.834
I'll get going then.

146
00:10:21.834 --> 00:10:22.995
Thanks again.

147
00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:24.265
- Bye. - Bye.

148
00:10:42.614 --> 00:10:43.655
Hello?

149
00:10:43.655 --> 00:10:45.354
Officer Bong, where are you?

150
00:10:46.594 --> 00:10:47.724
Well...

151
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:51.064
There are people fighting in the street.

152
00:10:51.064 --> 00:10:52.594
I'm trying to stop them.

153
00:10:52.594 --> 00:10:56.334
Excuse me. Sir! Please stop...

154
00:10:57.005 --> 00:10:58.765
Okay.

155
00:10:58.765 --> 00:11:00.734
Take care of it and get back soon.

156
00:11:00.734 --> 00:11:03.545
I'll be there as soon as I take care of this.

157
00:11:10.814 --> 00:11:12.114
- Excuse me. - Yes?

158
00:11:12.545 --> 00:11:15.084
Jo Seok Tae works here, doesn't he?

159
00:11:15.354 --> 00:11:16.525
Jo Seok Tae.

160
00:11:17.224 --> 00:11:19.584
Yes, he's with civil construction department.

161
00:11:20.295 --> 00:11:22.255
Where is civil construction department?

162
00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:24.025
Over there.

163
00:11:24.025 --> 00:11:25.694
Okay. Thank you.

164
00:11:36.604 --> 00:11:37.974
Seok Tae.

165
00:11:39.104 --> 00:11:40.114
Hey.

166
00:11:42.714 --> 00:11:43.714
Seok Tae.

167
00:11:43.844 --> 00:11:45.814
Are you with civil construction department?

168
00:11:47.684 --> 00:11:48.684
There you go.

169
00:11:48.785 --> 00:11:50.285
Thanks.

170
00:11:51.385 --> 00:11:54.694
I feel so relieved because you work...

171
00:11:54.694 --> 00:11:56.625
for the civil construction department.

172
00:11:57.395 --> 00:12:00.464
I believe the divine being is helping me.

173
00:12:00.464 --> 00:12:02.564
What's the favor you need to ask me?

174
00:12:02.564 --> 00:12:06.434
The manhole near the tunnel,

175
00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:09.135
why did that get removed all of a sudden?

176
00:12:09.734 --> 00:12:11.604
That manhole?

177
00:12:12.005 --> 00:12:14.415
There were too many complaints.

178
00:12:14.415 --> 00:12:16.314
People heard weird noises...

179
00:12:16.314 --> 00:12:18.245
and some said they saw ghosts.

180
00:12:18.245 --> 00:12:19.854
That's why we blocked it.

181
00:12:21.415 --> 00:12:22.515
Hey.

182
00:12:22.984 --> 00:12:27.125
Who believes in ghosts anymore?

183
00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:31.224
How can you block it because of complaints?

184
00:12:31.224 --> 00:12:34.364
Since when were the police interested in manholes?

185
00:12:40.704 --> 00:12:42.135
Seok Tae.

186
00:12:44.675 --> 00:12:46.074
Listen carefully.

187
00:12:47.344 --> 00:12:48.875
I'm not lying.

188
00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:50.415
I'm very serious.

189
00:12:51.584 --> 00:12:53.155
You have to believe me.

190
00:12:57.555 --> 00:12:58.824
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

191
00:12:59.084 --> 00:13:00.125
I know.

192
00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:01.895
I wouldn't believe me if I were you.

193
00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:03.265
But Seok Tae,

194
00:13:03.564 --> 00:13:06.295
these unbelievable things are happening to me.

195
00:13:07.564 --> 00:13:10.635
Okay. So...

196
00:13:10.905 --> 00:13:12.964
you ride this manhole...

197
00:13:12.964 --> 00:13:15.204
and travel in time.

198
00:13:15.204 --> 00:13:18.545
I've been going back and forth in time.

199
00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:20.344
Anyway, Seon Tae.

200
00:13:20.344 --> 00:13:22.974
I need the manhole to travel time again.

201
00:13:22.974 --> 00:13:26.214
Can you restore the manhole please?

202
00:13:26.814 --> 00:13:29.084
Hey, be honest.

203
00:13:29.354 --> 00:13:30.354
What?

204
00:13:30.354 --> 00:13:32.425
You made a bet with Goo Gil...

205
00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:34.224
on whether I trust you or not, right?

206
00:13:34.224 --> 00:13:35.795
What are you talking about?

207
00:13:35.795 --> 00:13:37.395
I'm serious now.

208
00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:39.464
I'm not the old Seok Tae anymore.

209
00:13:39.464 --> 00:13:41.094
Don't even think about fooling me.

210
00:13:41.094 --> 00:13:43.704
I have so much work to do as is.

211
00:13:43.704 --> 00:13:45.405
What nonsense are you talking about?

212
00:13:45.405 --> 00:13:46.405
Go, you punk.

213
00:13:46.704 --> 00:13:48.234
Hey, Seok Tae.

214
00:13:48.234 --> 00:13:50.444
Let go of me, and just go.

215
00:13:50.444 --> 00:13:51.574
Seok Tae!

216
00:13:51.775 --> 00:13:53.745
Trust me already!

217
00:13:55.344 --> 00:13:56.814
It's driving me crazy.

218
00:13:58.645 --> 00:13:59.745
Then again,

219
00:14:00.354 --> 00:14:03.354
it's hard to believe that I'm a time traveler.

220
00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:06.625
How should I persuade him?

221
00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:20.875
What?

222
00:14:21.974 --> 00:14:23.474
Why are you doing this to me?

223
00:14:35.755 --> 00:14:36.755
What is going on?

224
00:14:41.354 --> 00:14:42.354
Sir.

225
00:14:42.354 --> 00:14:44.125
- Are you okay? - Please go catch him.

226
00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:46.025
Stop right there!

227
00:14:53.035 --> 00:14:55.135
Hey, you! Stop!

228
00:15:45.255 --> 00:15:46.255
Sergeant Choi.

229
00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:48.594
There has been an assault.

230
00:15:58.135 --> 00:16:00.334
- Goodness. - Please stay still.

231
00:16:00.805 --> 00:16:04.905
What did I do to deserve this in broad daylight?

232
00:16:04.905 --> 00:16:06.045
Please calm down.

233
00:16:07.814 --> 00:16:08.875
He got away.

234
00:16:09.314 --> 00:16:10.385
How is the victim?

235
00:16:10.785 --> 00:16:12.545
He was passing by this tunnel,

236
00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:14.584
and the assailant beat him up for no reason.

237
00:16:15.515 --> 00:16:18.025
So many incidents happen in this tunnel.

238
00:16:18.984 --> 00:16:20.555
Did you see what he looks like?

239
00:16:20.555 --> 00:16:22.824
No, I chased him from behind, so I couldn't.

240
00:16:22.824 --> 00:16:24.194
Let's go to the office first.

241
00:16:24.364 --> 00:16:25.364
Yes, sir.

242
00:16:29.334 --> 00:16:30.434
Wait.

243
00:16:31.434 --> 00:16:32.665
There's something here.

244
00:16:37.045 --> 00:16:39.145
It looks like a broken part of an ornament.

245
00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:41.645
This might be a piece of evidence,

246
00:16:41.645 --> 00:16:43.344
so let's take it and hand it over.

247
00:16:43.614 --> 00:16:44.614
Yes, sir.

248
00:16:49.984 --> 00:16:53.454
While you're at it, clean the menu too.

249
00:16:54.194 --> 00:16:56.594
Let's set the utensil container again.

250
00:16:57.194 --> 00:16:59.265
Hey, Ms. Yun.

251
00:16:59.265 --> 00:17:00.934
What brings you here?

252
00:17:01.364 --> 00:17:05.205
It's been a while since I saw you carrying that bag.

253
00:17:05.205 --> 00:17:06.535
- Are you busy? - No.

254
00:17:06.535 --> 00:17:08.305
We haven't opened, so I'm not that busy.

255
00:17:08.305 --> 00:17:09.305
Is that so?

256
00:17:09.305 --> 00:17:12.005
Then shall we go out for lunch together?

257
00:17:12.745 --> 00:17:13.745
Sure.

258
00:17:14.144 --> 00:17:15.144
Let's go.

259
00:17:18.414 --> 00:17:19.884
Thank you.

260
00:17:19.884 --> 00:17:21.955
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

261
00:17:22.485 --> 00:17:24.084
They serve delicious noodles here.

262
00:17:24.084 --> 00:17:25.985
It's on me, so eat a lot.

263
00:17:32.064 --> 00:17:33.394
It's good.

264
00:17:34.295 --> 00:17:36.195
I guess you didn't pack Jae Hyun a lunchbox today.

265
00:17:36.195 --> 00:17:38.334
He seemed to have a lunch meeting today.

266
00:17:39.404 --> 00:17:40.404
Soo Jin.

267
00:17:40.834 --> 00:17:42.975
You two look great together.

268
00:17:42.975 --> 00:17:46.074
I want my marriage life to be like yours.

269
00:17:49.475 --> 00:17:52.584
Why did you bring your camera today?

270
00:17:54.884 --> 00:17:56.985
I was feeling a little down,

271
00:17:56.985 --> 00:17:59.384
so I wanted to take photos and refresh myself.

272
00:17:59.624 --> 00:18:01.455
Why would you feel down?

273
00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:03.324
You're happy every day.

274
00:18:05.795 --> 00:18:06.795
Jin Sook.

275
00:18:07.935 --> 00:18:10.134
It's nothing serious,

276
00:18:11.404 --> 00:18:13.134
but Jae Hyun...

277
00:18:14.574 --> 00:18:16.435
He had an argument with some man...

278
00:18:16.435 --> 00:18:18.705
regarding the parking problem yesterday.

279
00:18:19.245 --> 00:18:23.185
The man was pretty aged.

280
00:18:23.515 --> 00:18:26.654
But Jae Hyun acted rudely and yelled at him.

281
00:18:26.884 --> 00:18:29.824
That felt a little...

282
00:18:30.584 --> 00:18:31.755
Jae Hyun did?

283
00:18:32.584 --> 00:18:33.995
- That's unexpected. - Right?

284
00:18:34.824 --> 00:18:36.624
I was so surprised.

285
00:18:36.795 --> 00:18:39.695
He didn't feel like the Jae Hyun I know.

286
00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:42.935
He felt like a stranger to me all of a sudden.

287
00:18:42.935 --> 00:18:45.735
It may happen for men when they get angry.

288
00:18:45.735 --> 00:18:47.305
Seok Tae looks all nice too,

289
00:18:47.305 --> 00:18:49.435
but he's scary when he's mad.

290
00:18:49.604 --> 00:18:51.174
- Really? - And...

291
00:18:51.174 --> 00:18:53.644
Jae Hyun isn't a person to do such a thing.

292
00:18:54.015 --> 00:18:56.245
That man must've started the fight.

293
00:18:56.374 --> 00:18:59.584
And you must know when to be angry.

294
00:18:59.584 --> 00:19:01.314
Otherwise, others would look down on you.

295
00:19:01.485 --> 00:19:03.225
- Is that right? - I thought...

296
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:04.654
something bad happened.

297
00:19:04.654 --> 00:19:05.725
Don't worry,

298
00:19:05.725 --> 00:19:06.924
and let's enjoy our noodles.

299
00:19:07.025 --> 00:19:08.654
- I see. - There have been...

300
00:19:08.654 --> 00:19:09.755
a lot of assault cases...

301
00:19:09.755 --> 00:19:12.525
targeting unspecified individuals recently.

302
00:19:12.525 --> 00:19:15.735
The incidents caused by uncontrolled anger...

303
00:19:15.735 --> 00:19:18.305
are becoming a social issue.

304
00:19:18.805 --> 00:19:20.174
Last night, on a street in Seoul,

305
00:19:20.174 --> 00:19:22.235
an assailant beat up an innocent civilian...

306
00:19:22.235 --> 00:19:24.445
without any reason.

307
00:19:24.445 --> 00:19:26.074
- The 47-year-old man... - Is it good?

308
00:19:26.074 --> 00:19:27.314
was injured.

309
00:19:27.314 --> 00:19:29.985
- He's been hospitalized. - What a world.

310
00:19:29.985 --> 00:19:33.354
The assailant committed violence against...

311
00:19:33.354 --> 00:19:35.555
the victim who was walking off guard.

312
00:19:35.555 --> 00:19:37.455
- Why does it have to... - He wasn't captured in...

313
00:19:37.455 --> 00:19:39.154
- be in our neighborhood? - nearby security cameras.

314
00:19:39.154 --> 00:19:40.995
- How annoying. - Due to lack of evidence,

315
00:19:40.995 --> 00:19:43.695
the police can't seem to locate the culprit.

316
00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:46.094
It happened in that tunnel again.

317
00:19:46.094 --> 00:19:47.134
Again?

318
00:19:47.134 --> 00:19:49.465
Incidents keep happening in our district.

319
00:19:49.465 --> 00:19:51.634
It's become a crime-ridden area.

320
00:19:55.975 --> 00:19:56.975
Officer Bong,

321
00:19:57.445 --> 00:19:58.545
did you hurt your leg?

322
00:19:59.344 --> 00:20:00.745
- Yes. - Goodness.

323
00:20:00.745 --> 00:20:02.945
You're going through a lot.

324
00:20:03.515 --> 00:20:05.945
Leave work for today. We'll handle the rest.

325
00:20:05.945 --> 00:20:08.854
Okay. Call me if you need me.

326
00:20:08.854 --> 00:20:10.525
Okay. Bye.

327
00:20:10.525 --> 00:20:11.824
- Goodbye. - See you.

328
00:20:30.975 --> 00:20:34.344
Sir, you need to be at the meeting by 3pm.

329
00:20:48.025 --> 00:20:49.195
Mr. Kim.

330
00:20:49.965 --> 00:20:52.765
- Yes? - Do me a favor.

331
00:20:53.025 --> 00:20:54.035
Jung Ae.

332
00:20:55.064 --> 00:20:57.005
I've made some flyers. Check this out.

333
00:20:57.005 --> 00:20:59.064
You didn't have to do this.

334
00:20:59.334 --> 00:21:01.104
What do you think about the phrase?

335
00:21:01.205 --> 00:21:02.975
It'll be a hit if we hand these out.

336
00:21:02.975 --> 00:21:05.475
I'll hand them out at the intersection.

337
00:21:05.945 --> 00:21:06.945
Hello.

338
00:21:07.275 --> 00:21:09.215
Welcome. How may I help you?

339
00:21:09.215 --> 00:21:11.144
Do you do delivery too?

340
00:21:11.144 --> 00:21:13.285
Sure. How many do you need?

341
00:21:13.285 --> 00:21:14.854
I would like to order 40 cups.

342
00:21:15.154 --> 00:21:16.785
40 cups?

343
00:21:17.225 --> 00:21:18.785
Where should I deliver them?

344
00:21:19.055 --> 00:21:21.055
(Hong Juice)

345
00:21:25.394 --> 00:21:27.364
Don't you have to watch your store?

346
00:21:27.735 --> 00:21:30.235
No, I'm all right.

347
00:21:30.235 --> 00:21:33.005
You can't deliver 40 cups alone.

348
00:21:34.935 --> 00:21:36.745
It's better to be together than alone.

349
00:21:37.945 --> 00:21:39.005
I'll help you.

350
00:21:53.894 --> 00:21:56.354
(Director Oh Dal Soo)

351
00:22:00.064 --> 00:22:02.465
Hello.

352
00:22:02.965 --> 00:22:05.035
Hello.

353
00:22:05.705 --> 00:22:08.634
Gosh, this company is huge.

354
00:22:09.435 --> 00:22:11.904
The female employees are all pretty and fancy.

355
00:22:11.904 --> 00:22:13.374
Those shoes are expensive.

356
00:22:13.374 --> 00:22:14.414
Jung Ae.

357
00:22:15.015 --> 00:22:16.715
You're so much prettier.

358
00:22:17.685 --> 00:22:20.185
By the way, how did they know about my place?

359
00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:21.955
You got an order as soon as...

360
00:22:21.955 --> 00:22:23.854
I made the flyers.

361
00:22:23.854 --> 00:22:25.525
You didn't even hand them out yet.

362
00:22:25.884 --> 00:22:27.894
Anyway, I guess there's always a way out.

363
00:22:27.894 --> 00:22:29.195
I should make them my regulars.

364
00:22:29.455 --> 00:22:30.725
Let's deliver them to the meeting room.

365
00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:31.795
Let's go.

366
00:22:31.795 --> 00:22:33.735
Hello, it's Hong Juice.

367
00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:37.965
Come in.

368
00:22:39.735 --> 00:22:42.305
I'd appreciate it if you place one at each seat.

369
00:22:43.134 --> 00:22:44.505
Don't worry.

370
00:22:45.545 --> 00:22:48.614
Thank you so much for making an order.

371
00:22:48.614 --> 00:22:51.614
Call me whenever you have meetings.

372
00:22:51.614 --> 00:22:53.755
We'll deliver it to you whether it's 40 or 100.

373
00:22:53.755 --> 00:22:56.485
That's... It wasn't me who bought them.

374
00:22:56.485 --> 00:22:58.654
It was the director's order.

375
00:22:58.654 --> 00:23:00.654
I only did as I was told.

376
00:23:00.654 --> 00:23:01.854
The director?

377
00:23:03.624 --> 00:23:04.695
Come in.

378
00:23:06.834 --> 00:23:08.164
Excuse me.

379
00:23:08.394 --> 00:23:10.634
Is the director inside?

380
00:23:22.215 --> 00:23:23.985
Hello, sir.

381
00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:25.685
We're from Hong Juice.

382
00:23:26.215 --> 00:23:29.015
I heard you went out of your way to order...

383
00:23:29.015 --> 00:23:30.725
from our business, so we came to say thanks.

384
00:23:33.154 --> 00:23:34.894
Oh, you're welcome.

385
00:23:35.354 --> 00:23:36.354
It's fine.

386
00:23:36.354 --> 00:23:38.564
We'd like to thank you face to face.

387
00:23:39.394 --> 00:23:40.695
Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:44.664
I am not comfortable talking to strangers.

389
00:23:45.735 --> 00:23:48.005
You're a very picky customer.

390
00:23:49.435 --> 00:23:50.904
Oh, I see.

391
00:23:51.144 --> 00:23:53.174
Thank you anyway.

392
00:23:53.874 --> 00:23:56.545
Yes, do call us again.

393
00:23:56.914 --> 00:24:00.455
I'll leave one of our flyers here.

394
00:24:00.455 --> 00:24:03.084
You can call us directly instead of sending a guy.

395
00:24:04.685 --> 00:24:06.755
Goodbye, then.

396
00:24:08.055 --> 00:24:09.055
Goodbye.

397
00:24:12.525 --> 00:24:16.394
(Ah Ri Love)

398
00:24:24.074 --> 00:24:26.074
Why would a director of a company read comics?

399
00:25:29.134 --> 00:25:32.344
My gosh, hello. We meet again.

400
00:25:32.344 --> 00:25:33.614
Yes.

401
00:25:33.614 --> 00:25:35.674
It must be because we live in the same neighborhood.

402
00:25:35.674 --> 00:25:38.245
It must be fate that we meet so often.

403
00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:39.344
You must be right.

404
00:25:40.354 --> 00:25:42.555
Are you a photographer?

405
00:25:42.555 --> 00:25:45.584
Oh, it's only a hobby nowadays.

406
00:25:45.584 --> 00:25:47.495
I also take photographs as a hobby.

407
00:25:47.495 --> 00:25:48.555
I'm very glad to meet you.

408
00:25:48.555 --> 00:25:49.624
Really?

409
00:25:50.025 --> 00:25:52.394
Then did you major in photography?

410
00:25:52.394 --> 00:25:53.795
No.

411
00:25:53.795 --> 00:25:55.965
I take them personally.

412
00:25:57.664 --> 00:25:59.364
Since we meet so often,

413
00:25:59.364 --> 00:26:01.334
why don't we go out to take pictures together?

414
00:26:01.334 --> 00:26:02.935
I'd be more than happy to.

415
00:26:02.935 --> 00:26:05.144
Things get pretty boring if you go out by yourself.

416
00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:10.844
Oh, did you say it was your husband's phone?

417
00:26:11.045 --> 00:26:13.455
- Yes. - You look pretty young.

418
00:26:13.455 --> 00:26:15.515
Did you two get married recently?

419
00:26:15.785 --> 00:26:18.525
Oh, yes. We're still newlyweds.

420
00:26:19.654 --> 00:26:20.955
You must be happy.

421
00:26:21.225 --> 00:26:23.025
Yes, of course.

422
00:26:26.295 --> 00:26:29.134
I forgot to ask you for your name.

423
00:26:30.134 --> 00:26:32.064
I'm Park Young Ju.

424
00:26:32.235 --> 00:26:34.334
Oh, Park Young Ju.

425
00:26:34.334 --> 00:26:36.874
I'm Kang Soo Jin.

426
00:26:37.245 --> 00:26:38.305
Okay.

427
00:26:40.844 --> 00:26:43.185
Do you want to see the pictures I took?

428
00:26:52.624 --> 00:26:54.924
Gosh, look at this, and I didn't get to the manhole.

429
00:26:56.154 --> 00:26:57.265
Gosh, that hurts.

430
00:27:14.144 --> 00:27:15.275
Pil,

431
00:27:15.275 --> 00:27:17.584
forget about the past as of today,

432
00:27:17.945 --> 00:27:19.614
and return as my friend.

433
00:27:20.314 --> 00:27:21.354
Okay?

434
00:27:22.215 --> 00:27:24.624
So why don't we shake hands?

435
00:27:25.624 --> 00:27:27.594
Let's have a great haul, my friend.

436
00:28:00.624 --> 00:28:02.924
Hey, Pil. Are you working?

437
00:28:04.624 --> 00:28:05.624
Yes.

438
00:28:07.564 --> 00:28:08.634
Hey.

439
00:28:09.535 --> 00:28:11.205
What's with your leg?

440
00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:15.005
I fell.

441
00:28:15.005 --> 00:28:17.674
What? Let me see that.

442
00:28:23.844 --> 00:28:26.215
Hey, are you all right?

443
00:28:26.914 --> 00:28:28.785
Look, you're bleeding.

444
00:28:28.785 --> 00:28:31.854
Did you go to a hospital?

445
00:28:32.455 --> 00:28:33.495
My gosh.

446
00:28:33.495 --> 00:28:35.654
I asked you if you went to the hospital.

447
00:28:36.025 --> 00:28:38.594
I don't have to go to a hospital for this.

448
00:28:38.725 --> 00:28:40.164
It'll heal itself in time.

449
00:28:40.334 --> 00:28:41.935
What are you saying?

450
00:28:42.094 --> 00:28:43.834
You should've at least given yourself first aid.

451
00:28:44.235 --> 00:28:47.104
It's nothing, I'm really fine, so you should go.

452
00:28:47.104 --> 00:28:48.975
You aren't okay.

453
00:28:49.074 --> 00:28:51.245
I can't let you go. Follow me.

454
00:28:51.245 --> 00:28:52.505
- Hey. - Hurry.

455
00:28:52.505 --> 00:28:53.844
- Soo Jin. - Hurry up.

456
00:28:53.844 --> 00:28:54.914
Come on.

457
00:29:03.985 --> 00:29:05.084
Jae Hyun.

458
00:29:09.824 --> 00:29:11.664
Are you coming back from lunch?

459
00:29:11.864 --> 00:29:13.025
Yes.

460
00:29:13.735 --> 00:29:16.164
Why are you two here together?

461
00:29:16.195 --> 00:29:17.935
Pil hurt his leg,

462
00:29:17.935 --> 00:29:19.564
but he won't go see a doctor.

463
00:29:19.564 --> 00:29:21.235
So I brought him here.

464
00:29:21.275 --> 00:29:23.074
Can you treat him?

465
00:29:23.545 --> 00:29:24.775
Really?

466
00:29:25.545 --> 00:29:27.814
I'm fine, really. I'll get going now.

467
00:29:27.814 --> 00:29:30.314
Where do you think you're going?

468
00:29:30.314 --> 00:29:31.685
Aren't you going to listen to me?

469
00:29:32.985 --> 00:29:35.485
Why don't you come in? Let me take a look.

470
00:29:37.955 --> 00:29:39.354
Go on.

471
00:29:39.624 --> 00:29:41.324
Go inside. Hurry.

472
00:29:56.945 --> 00:29:58.644
How is he? Isn't this bad?

473
00:29:59.644 --> 00:30:01.975
I told you that you should go see a doctor.

474
00:30:02.475 --> 00:30:04.215
You don't have to go see a doctor.

475
00:30:07.854 --> 00:30:09.654
Put on antibiotic ointment on it often.

476
00:30:09.955 --> 00:30:12.854
You'll be fine in a few days, so don't worry.

477
00:30:12.854 --> 00:30:14.094
You heard him.

478
00:30:14.094 --> 00:30:16.824
Make sure you don't forget to put it on.

479
00:30:17.924 --> 00:30:19.394
How much do I owe you?

480
00:30:19.725 --> 00:30:22.134
You don't need to pay him.

481
00:30:22.134 --> 00:30:23.634
I brought you here.

482
00:30:24.664 --> 00:30:26.465
Right, Jae Hyun?

483
00:30:28.005 --> 00:30:29.674
Hey, if your wound doesn't heal,

484
00:30:29.674 --> 00:30:31.144
make sure you go see a doctor.

485
00:30:32.104 --> 00:30:34.545
Okay, I will.

486

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

487
00:31:08.015 --> 00:31:11.844
Why didn't he even thank you?

488
00:31:13.114 --> 00:31:14.685
Thanks, my dear.

489
00:31:14.814 --> 00:31:15.884
Sure.

490
00:31:16.985 --> 00:31:20.094
Right, I found your cell phone.

491
00:31:21.295 --> 00:31:22.324
Look.

492
00:31:22.894 --> 00:31:24.025
Where did you find it?

493
00:31:24.094 --> 00:31:25.465
It was apparently at the park.

494
00:31:25.465 --> 00:31:27.664
One of our neighbors found it for us.

495
00:31:41.844 --> 00:31:43.745
Hello, this is sewerage control.

496
00:31:43.745 --> 00:31:45.844
I was taking a walk at the park,

497
00:31:45.844 --> 00:31:48.255
and I keep hearing weird sound in the manhole.

498
00:31:48.814 --> 00:31:50.525
Pardon? What kind of sound?

499
00:31:50.884 --> 00:31:53.755
It kind of sounds like a person,

500
00:31:53.755 --> 00:31:55.525
or it might be an animal.

501
00:31:55.555 --> 00:31:58.795
Anyway, it's really scary, so please take a look.

502
00:31:58.965 --> 00:32:00.634
Yes, sure.

503
00:32:03.735 --> 00:32:04.805
Was that a complaint?

504
00:32:05.035 --> 00:32:08.205
Yes, she's hearing weird sounds from a manhole.

505
00:32:08.205 --> 00:32:10.005
Is that the one at the park?

506
00:32:10.005 --> 00:32:12.144
Did you get a similar call?

507
00:32:12.674 --> 00:32:14.045
That's uncanny.

508
00:32:14.245 --> 00:32:16.515
I got a complaint a few days ago that said...

509
00:32:16.515 --> 00:32:17.985
they saw a weird light coming from the manhole.

510
00:32:17.985 --> 00:32:19.854
But I didn't see anything when I got there.

511
00:32:19.854 --> 00:32:20.914
It's that manhole again.

512
00:32:20.914 --> 00:32:23.685
Is there a ghost in that manhole or something?

513
00:32:24.124 --> 00:32:25.955
There's no such thing.

514
00:32:25.955 --> 00:32:27.695
I'll check it tonight.

515
00:32:27.695 --> 00:32:28.755
Okay.

516
00:32:33.394 --> 00:32:35.064
My gosh.

517
00:32:35.864 --> 00:32:37.634
It looks fine.

518
00:32:41.435 --> 00:32:43.545
Goodness, what's wrong with the lamp?

519
00:32:56.624 --> 00:32:58.285
Let's see.

520
00:33:01.995 --> 00:33:03.894
I don't see anything weird.

521
00:33:11.305 --> 00:33:13.435
Goodness, what's going on?

522
00:33:15.775 --> 00:33:17.945
What? What is this?

523
00:33:19.475 --> 00:33:20.475
What's going on?

524
00:33:25.215 --> 00:33:26.215
What's this?

525
00:33:29.654 --> 00:33:31.285
Gosh, I'm curious.

526
00:33:34.394 --> 00:33:36.495
- Goodness. - What on earth?

527
00:33:41.935 --> 00:33:43.705
What is this? What's going on?

528
00:33:46.104 --> 00:33:47.305
My goodness.

529
00:33:48.935 --> 00:33:49.945
What is this?

530
00:33:52.545 --> 00:33:53.614
What is this?

531
00:33:53.874 --> 00:33:55.814
No!

532
00:34:04.924 --> 00:34:05.985
Goodness.

533
00:34:13.765 --> 00:34:17.004
Is Pil really traveling in time through that manhole?

534
00:34:29.544 --> 00:34:30.714
Hi, Jin Sook.

535
00:34:31.544 --> 00:34:34.714
No, I'm not busy. I should be done by 6pm.

536
00:34:34.984 --> 00:34:35.984
Yes.

537
00:34:36.085 --> 00:34:38.355
It's yummy. Do you want some?

538
00:34:38.355 --> 00:34:39.955
No, you finish it.

539
00:34:39.955 --> 00:34:42.055
I'm full just watching you eat.

540
00:34:43.055 --> 00:34:46.364
Seok Tae, why were you angry earlier?

541
00:34:46.364 --> 00:34:47.395
That?

542
00:34:47.495 --> 00:34:49.464
I think Pil used me...

543
00:34:49.464 --> 00:34:51.265
to make a bet with Goo Gil.

544
00:34:51.265 --> 00:34:53.274
A bet? What bet?

545
00:34:53.574 --> 00:34:55.835
Pil told me he...

546
00:34:55.835 --> 00:34:59.205
was traveling in time through a manhole.

547
00:34:59.375 --> 00:35:01.174
What kind of nonsense is that?

548
00:35:01.174 --> 00:35:02.245
I don't know.

549
00:35:02.475 --> 00:35:04.384
I think they're trying to see...

550
00:35:04.384 --> 00:35:07.614
whether I'd believe that or not.

551
00:35:07.785 --> 00:35:09.415
Pil thinks I'm an idiot.

552
00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:11.685
Gosh, that jerk.

553
00:35:11.824 --> 00:35:12.955
Do you want me to hit him?

554
00:35:13.455 --> 00:35:14.524
It's okay.

555
00:35:14.895 --> 00:35:16.055
But...

556
00:35:16.455 --> 00:35:18.294
there's this one thing.

557
00:35:19.294 --> 00:35:20.594
Remember when I told you about...

558
00:35:20.594 --> 00:35:22.065
that weird moment at the manhole?

559
00:35:22.734 --> 00:35:26.065
- Yes, that manhole that's been removed? - Yes.

560
00:35:26.605 --> 00:35:28.835
Don't you think it's possible that...

561
00:35:28.835 --> 00:35:31.004
it might do something strange...

562
00:35:31.004 --> 00:35:33.004
and make you travel in time?

563
00:35:34.315 --> 00:35:35.815
Seok Tae.

564
00:35:35.815 --> 00:35:38.015
You're too innocent.

565
00:35:38.015 --> 00:35:40.685
That's why Pil always gets you.

566
00:35:40.785 --> 00:35:41.955
I told you.

567
00:35:41.984 --> 00:35:44.185
You were seeing things because you were tired.

568
00:35:45.055 --> 00:35:46.754
It's nonsense, right?

569
00:35:47.154 --> 00:35:50.895
Seok Tae. From now on only listen...

570
00:35:50.895 --> 00:35:52.324
to what I say, got it?

571
00:35:52.324 --> 00:35:53.495
Okay.

572
00:35:53.794 --> 00:35:56.935
Eat up. You're so cute.

573
00:35:56.935 --> 00:35:58.134
What's wrong?

574
00:35:58.634 --> 00:35:59.935
It's strange.

575
00:36:15.915 --> 00:36:18.355
Hey, are you okay?

576
00:36:18.984 --> 00:36:21.725
Goodness. Blood...

577
00:36:21.955 --> 00:36:23.924
Did you go to the hospital?

578
00:36:35.035 --> 00:36:36.134
Soo Jin.

579
00:36:38.174 --> 00:36:40.344
We decided to stay as friends.

580
00:36:41.774 --> 00:36:43.285
Why can't I do that?

581
00:36:45.944 --> 00:36:48.855
I have to get over you.

582
00:36:49.654 --> 00:36:51.024
But it's hard.

583
00:36:53.855 --> 00:36:56.455
I must not be ready to accept the fact...

584
00:36:58.665 --> 00:37:00.565
that you're married.

585
00:37:06.634 --> 00:37:08.504
The manhole is gone.

586
00:37:09.705 --> 00:37:11.605
What should I do now?

587
00:37:23.484 --> 00:37:25.384
(Soo Jin)

588
00:37:25.384 --> 00:37:27.024
(Pil, are you okay?)

589
00:37:27.024 --> 00:37:29.594
Pil, are you okay?

590
00:37:36.734 --> 00:37:37.734
Yes.

591
00:37:41.004 --> 00:37:44.805
(Pil, are you okay?)

592
00:37:48.844 --> 00:37:51.415
A text message isn't enough.

593
00:38:10.065 --> 00:38:12.504
(I'm okay.)

594
00:38:37.694 --> 00:38:39.594
(I'm okay. Don't worry.)

595
00:38:39.594 --> 00:38:41.794
I'm okay. Don't worry.

596
00:38:44.805 --> 00:38:47.475
- Who was that? - It was Pil.

597
00:38:47.705 --> 00:38:50.745
He says he's better thanks to you.

598
00:38:53.274 --> 00:38:54.844
- Soo Jin. - Yes?

599
00:38:55.344 --> 00:38:57.114
Have you ever liked Pil?

600
00:38:57.984 --> 00:38:58.984
What?

601
00:39:00.055 --> 00:39:02.685
It seemed like he liked you a lot.

602
00:39:03.654 --> 00:39:05.024
I wondered how you felt about him.

603
00:39:05.785 --> 00:39:07.694
Did you ever like him as a guy?

604
00:39:08.754 --> 00:39:10.495
What are you saying?

605
00:39:10.495 --> 00:39:12.225
Pil is just a friend.

606
00:39:13.165 --> 00:39:14.165
Is he?

607
00:39:14.335 --> 00:39:17.765
I feel like you don't think of him as a friend.

608
00:39:20.574 --> 00:39:21.975
What do you mean, Jae Hyun?

609
00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:26.274
The way you look at Pil.

610
00:39:26.714 --> 00:39:27.774
Your behavior.

611
00:39:28.645 --> 00:39:30.085
It seems a bit different.

612
00:39:34.685 --> 00:39:37.884
Jae Hyun, you got it wrong.

613
00:39:38.185 --> 00:39:39.785
To me,

614
00:39:39.995 --> 00:39:42.855
Pil is no different from Jin Sook or Jung Ae.

615
00:39:43.565 --> 00:39:46.194
He lived next door since we were young,

616
00:39:46.194 --> 00:39:47.964
so we were like family.

617
00:39:47.995 --> 00:39:49.794
I guess that's why we seemed close.

618
00:39:51.464 --> 00:39:52.835
- Really? - Yes.

619
00:39:53.634 --> 00:39:55.004
I trust you.

620
00:39:55.504 --> 00:39:57.904
I don't think you'd disappoint me.

621
00:39:57.904 --> 00:40:00.315
Of course not.

622
00:40:02.844 --> 00:40:05.245
We're out of kiwi. It's your favorite.

623
00:40:05.614 --> 00:40:07.085
- I'll go get more. - It's okay.

624
00:40:07.714 --> 00:40:08.884
I'll get it.

625
00:40:33.645 --> 00:40:34.645
Where did you find it?

626
00:40:34.745 --> 00:40:36.074
It was apparently at the park.

627
00:40:36.074 --> 00:40:38.685
One of our neighbors found it for us.

628
00:40:41.984 --> 00:40:43.114
Here you go.

629
00:40:43.455 --> 00:40:44.785
What are you looking at?

630
00:40:45.125 --> 00:40:47.154
I was just looking at your pictures.

631
00:40:48.294 --> 00:40:49.924
Who is this woman?

632
00:40:50.324 --> 00:40:53.364
She's the one who found your phone.

633
00:40:53.364 --> 00:40:54.694
I bumped into her yesterday...

634
00:40:54.694 --> 00:40:56.065
when I was taking pictures.

635
00:40:56.835 --> 00:40:57.904
I see.

636
00:41:09.844 --> 00:41:10.844
Hey.

637
00:41:11.245 --> 00:41:12.245
Seok Tae.

638
00:41:12.444 --> 00:41:14.085
Pil. What are you doing here?

639
00:41:14.085 --> 00:41:15.214
Have you been waiting for me?

640
00:41:15.384 --> 00:41:16.524
Seok Tae.

641
00:41:17.424 --> 00:41:19.995
I have nobody else to help me.

642
00:41:20.225 --> 00:41:21.524
Let's have a talk, please.

643
00:41:21.524 --> 00:41:22.524
About what?

644
00:41:23.225 --> 00:41:25.324
It's about that again, isn't it?

645
00:41:25.324 --> 00:41:27.495
- No. Go home. - It's real.

646
00:41:27.495 --> 00:41:28.995
How can I make you to believe me?

647
00:41:28.995 --> 00:41:30.065
Shall I kneel before you?

648
00:41:30.065 --> 00:41:31.864
No. Stop. Just go home.

649
00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:33.035
Hey, Seok Tae.

650
00:41:33.035 --> 00:41:34.435
Please help me.

651
00:41:34.435 --> 00:41:36.035
Why won't you help your friend?

652
00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:38.305
Hey, please save me. Seok Tae.

653
00:41:38.305 --> 00:41:40.844
- Seok Tae. - No. Just leave.

654
00:41:40.844 --> 00:41:42.274
Hey, Seok Tae.

655
00:41:42.274 --> 00:41:43.384
Jo Seok Tae!

656
00:41:43.685 --> 00:41:45.685
- Listen to me! - Is he crazy?

657
00:41:45.685 --> 00:41:48.884
- Open the door! - Hey. Be quiet. Go home!

658
00:41:49.185 --> 00:41:50.225
Hey!

659
00:41:52.024 --> 00:41:53.794
Oh, my gosh.

660
00:42:00.594 --> 00:42:02.495
What should I do?

661
00:42:14.774 --> 00:42:15.774
No.

662
00:42:16.044 --> 00:42:18.344
I really love my wife.

663
00:42:18.484 --> 00:42:20.315
You can't even imagine how much I love her.

664
00:42:26.154 --> 00:42:27.754
We're still newlyweds.

665
00:42:28.924 --> 00:42:30.194
You must be happy.

666
00:42:30.424 --> 00:42:32.125
Oh, sure.

667
00:42:54.384 --> 00:42:57.154
Jae Hyun.

668
00:43:03.964 --> 00:43:06.395
Jae Hyun!

669
00:43:25.245 --> 00:43:28.154
Miss, open the door.

670
00:43:28.154 --> 00:43:30.185
Something's going on inside,

671
00:43:30.185 --> 00:43:31.585
but she won't open the door.

672
00:43:31.585 --> 00:43:33.495
- What should we do? - Miss.

673
00:43:33.495 --> 00:43:35.524
What's going on inside?

674
00:43:35.524 --> 00:43:37.094
Don't you know anything?

675
00:43:37.225 --> 00:43:40.565
Miss, we know you're inside, so open the door.

676
00:43:40.864 --> 00:43:43.035
- Goodness. - What should we do?

677
00:43:43.165 --> 00:43:44.305
Goodness.

678
00:43:44.364 --> 00:43:47.535
Miss, please open the door.

679
00:43:48.674 --> 00:43:50.174
Goodness.

680
00:43:51.504 --> 00:43:54.145
Miss, open the door.

681
00:44:08.995 --> 00:44:11.225
Gosh, why won't this break?

682
00:44:12.024 --> 00:44:13.094
Seok Tae,

683
00:44:13.835 --> 00:44:15.634
if you can't do it, I'll do it myself.

684
00:44:29.074 --> 00:44:30.114
It's the patrol office.

685
00:44:34.254 --> 00:44:35.815
- Hello? - Well,

686
00:44:35.815 --> 00:44:37.824
I'm sorry to call you when you left work.

687
00:44:37.884 --> 00:44:39.555
It's okay. What's the matter?

688
00:44:39.555 --> 00:44:42.194
The woman who lived in seclusion last time.

689
00:44:42.424 --> 00:44:46.125
People heard breaking sounds in her room.

690
00:44:46.864 --> 00:44:48.935
Can you go check?

691
00:44:48.935 --> 00:44:50.134
Well...

692
00:44:50.535 --> 00:44:51.935
Now?

693
00:44:51.935 --> 00:44:54.674
I'll go if it's uncomfortable for you.

694
00:44:54.674 --> 00:44:56.544
No, it's okay.

695
00:44:57.404 --> 00:45:00.745
I'll go check now.

696
00:45:01.815 --> 00:45:03.285
Sorry, Mr. Bong.

697
00:45:03.285 --> 00:45:05.745
I'll treat you to a meal next time. Thanks.

698
00:45:05.915 --> 00:45:06.984
No problem.

699
00:45:12.024 --> 00:45:14.754
I need Seok Tae to restore the manhole.

700
00:45:15.654 --> 00:45:17.824
Why do I have so many things to do?

701
00:45:38.015 --> 00:45:39.185
Jae Hyun.

702
00:45:42.085 --> 00:45:43.585
Let's go somewhere and talk.

703
00:45:44.625 --> 00:45:46.824
Can't we just talk here?

704
00:45:49.725 --> 00:45:51.024
Jae Hyun.

705
00:45:58.705 --> 00:46:01.605
What? Why is Jae Hyun here?

706
00:46:03.605 --> 00:46:04.605
Hold on.

707
00:46:15.654 --> 00:46:18.024
Jae Hyun. Don't be like this.

708
00:46:18.024 --> 00:46:19.824
You didn't take it seriously...

709
00:46:20.154 --> 00:46:21.754
because I was being nice, did you?

710
00:46:22.024 --> 00:46:23.995
Why are you showing up in front of Soo Jin?

711
00:46:24.665 --> 00:46:26.094
- Well? - What do you mean?

712
00:46:30.234 --> 00:46:32.665
You took my phone to meet Soo Jin, didn't you?

713
00:46:34.234 --> 00:46:37.574
What were you going to say to her?

714
00:46:37.574 --> 00:46:38.645
No.

715
00:46:39.674 --> 00:46:41.344
I was just curious...

716
00:46:41.544 --> 00:46:43.685
what she was like. That's all.

717
00:46:44.544 --> 00:46:46.015
Please...

718
00:46:46.315 --> 00:46:47.455
I was just...

719
00:46:52.455 --> 00:46:53.594
Jae...

720
00:46:55.055 --> 00:46:56.495
Jae Hyun...

721
00:46:58.065 --> 00:46:59.225
Jae Hyun...

722
00:46:59.765 --> 00:47:02.435
You know how I become when I get mad.

723
00:47:02.435 --> 00:47:03.535
Jae...

724
00:47:03.634 --> 00:47:05.935
If you try to see her once again,

725
00:47:06.435 --> 00:47:08.935
I won't let it slide, so you better behave.

726
00:47:58.555 --> 00:47:59.955
Where have you been?

727
00:48:01.995 --> 00:48:03.094
What do you want?

728
00:48:04.065 --> 00:48:05.895
I went to Young Ju's house a while ago...

729
00:48:05.995 --> 00:48:08.364
and saw you take her somewhere.

730
00:48:09.194 --> 00:48:10.335
So?

731
00:48:10.765 --> 00:48:13.574
Didn't you say you two broke up?

732
00:48:13.574 --> 00:48:15.335
I met her because I had something to say.

733
00:48:15.335 --> 00:48:17.344
You could've just said it in front of her house.

734
00:48:17.344 --> 00:48:19.004
Why did you take her somewhere?

735
00:48:19.004 --> 00:48:20.344
And you forced her to get in.

736
00:48:21.574 --> 00:48:23.815
I'm on my way back after taking her to her house.

737
00:48:24.415 --> 00:48:26.245
What are you suspecting?

738
00:48:26.714 --> 00:48:29.585
Are you worried I might cheat on Soo Jin?

739
00:48:29.585 --> 00:48:30.625
Who knows...

740
00:48:31.185 --> 00:48:33.194
what you scheme in secret?

741
00:48:37.794 --> 00:48:40.194
You said Young Ju was a stalker. Is it true?

742
00:48:41.065 --> 00:48:43.805
Or is it because you're cutting her off?

743
00:48:45.765 --> 00:48:47.274
Think however you'd like.

744
00:48:47.404 --> 00:48:48.935
You won't believe me anyway.

745
00:48:54.574 --> 00:48:56.415
I hope you don't say anything foolish to her...

746
00:48:56.415 --> 00:48:58.544
and cause a misunderstanding.

747
00:49:21.134 --> 00:49:24.375
Why do I feel like he isn't a friend to you?

748
00:49:27.375 --> 00:49:28.875
What do you mean?

749
00:49:30.214 --> 00:49:32.785
The way you look at Pil.

750
00:49:33.484 --> 00:49:34.484
Your behavior.

751
00:49:35.384 --> 00:49:36.955
It seems a bit different.

752
00:49:47.035 --> 00:49:48.565
(Pil)

753
00:49:52.035 --> 00:49:54.475
Hi, Pil. What's up?

754
00:49:56.605 --> 00:49:58.904
Soo Jin, do you have a moment?

755
00:49:59.274 --> 00:50:00.745
I need to talk to you.

756
00:50:00.844 --> 00:50:01.944
Now?

757
00:50:02.475 --> 00:50:04.484
No, I'm busy.

758
00:50:05.214 --> 00:50:06.754
Talk to me on the phone.

759
00:50:06.785 --> 00:50:08.685
It's not something that I can talk on the phone.

760
00:50:09.015 --> 00:50:10.484
Spare me some time.

761
00:50:10.855 --> 00:50:12.024
It'll be just for a moment.

762
00:50:55.565 --> 00:50:59.734
Sitting here makes me feel great.

763
00:51:00.835 --> 00:51:02.574
The other kids don't know about it.

764
00:51:02.574 --> 00:51:04.174
I discovered this place.

765
00:51:04.444 --> 00:51:06.074
It's your seat now.

766
00:51:06.174 --> 00:51:07.214
Really?

767
00:51:07.444 --> 00:51:08.444
Of course.

768
00:51:08.444 --> 00:51:11.145
I won't let others sit on here.

769
00:51:24.625 --> 00:51:26.835
I lost my chance...

770
00:51:28.935 --> 00:51:30.265
to tell you.

771
00:51:34.875 --> 00:51:37.174
Because you were always beside me,

772
00:51:40.444 --> 00:51:42.574
I thought I'd be able to tell you...

773
00:51:46.044 --> 00:51:48.585
whenever I made up my mind to say...

774
00:51:52.984 --> 00:51:54.094
that I...

775
00:51:55.254 --> 00:51:56.924
like you.

776
00:51:58.565 --> 00:52:00.364
I should've said it...

777
00:52:01.864 --> 00:52:03.634
on the beach that day.

778
00:52:05.935 --> 00:52:07.734
But I couldn't tell you.

779
00:52:15.544 --> 00:52:16.944
I regret it so much.

780
00:52:17.444 --> 00:52:18.515
All right.

781
00:52:19.614 --> 00:52:20.754
Let's get married.

782
00:52:21.815 --> 00:52:22.884
What?

783
00:52:22.884 --> 00:52:24.524
You said everything will go back to normal...

784
00:52:24.524 --> 00:52:26.654
once you travel time through the manhole.

785
00:52:27.024 --> 00:52:28.495
So let's get married.

786
00:52:38.464 --> 00:52:40.574
When things go back to how they used to be,

787
00:52:40.975 --> 00:52:42.574
what will I be like?

788
00:52:45.444 --> 00:52:46.745
Well...

789
00:52:48.574 --> 00:52:49.645
Just...

790
00:52:51.044 --> 00:52:52.645
You'll be just the same.

791
00:52:54.654 --> 00:52:56.415
You'll be waiting for me.

792
00:53:01.924 --> 00:53:03.424
Preparing for our wedding.

793
00:53:14.174 --> 00:53:16.605
A lot of things happened right here with you.

794
00:53:17.844 --> 00:53:20.074
There is no one beside me,

795
00:53:21.774 --> 00:53:23.984
but you already have someone else beside you.

796
00:53:51.504 --> 00:53:52.504
Pil.

797
00:53:53.375 --> 00:53:54.975
Hey, you're here.

798
00:53:56.714 --> 00:53:58.114
Why did you want to see me?

799
00:54:00.015 --> 00:54:01.955
Oh, well...

800
00:54:04.024 --> 00:54:05.185
To be honest, today...

801
00:54:17.205 --> 00:54:18.205
Soo Jin.

802
00:54:19.464 --> 00:54:22.875
Did you know a lot about Jae Hyun before marriage?

803
00:54:23.975 --> 00:54:25.745
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

804
00:54:25.745 --> 00:54:27.174
I was wondering...

805
00:54:27.174 --> 00:54:29.174
if you got married to him after getting to know him.

806
00:54:30.815 --> 00:54:32.714
What are you trying to say?

807
00:54:35.484 --> 00:54:36.984
I'll be frank.

808
00:54:38.424 --> 00:54:40.855
I'm not entirely sure if he's a good man.

809
00:54:41.495 --> 00:54:43.324
He may be good to you on the surface,

810
00:54:43.594 --> 00:54:45.495
but I'm sure there is something you don't know.

811
00:54:45.495 --> 00:54:46.495
Pil.

812
00:54:47.734 --> 00:54:49.464
Jae Hyun is my husband.

813
00:54:50.265 --> 00:54:51.504
I probably know...

814
00:54:51.605 --> 00:54:54.234
more about him than you ever will.

815
00:54:55.305 --> 00:54:56.305
Right.

816
00:54:56.645 --> 00:54:58.574
- But Soo Jin... - I asked you, remember?

817
00:54:59.074 --> 00:55:01.315
Please respect my decision.

818
00:55:02.274 --> 00:55:03.745
You doing this...

819
00:55:03.884 --> 00:55:05.915
really doesn't help me in any way.

820
00:55:07.114 --> 00:55:08.114
Are you saying this...

821
00:55:08.714 --> 00:55:11.585
because you want my marriage to fall apart?

822
00:55:13.424 --> 00:55:15.355
It's not like that.

823
00:55:16.055 --> 00:55:18.495
I wish for your happiness more than anyone.

824
00:55:18.665 --> 00:55:20.464
How can I do that?

825
00:55:21.335 --> 00:55:23.605
If you want me to be happy,

826
00:55:24.464 --> 00:55:25.835
then don't ever speak ill of...

827
00:55:26.134 --> 00:55:27.705
Jae Hyun in front of me.

828
00:55:32.305 --> 00:55:35.074
I'm not sure what you're trying to say,

829
00:55:36.074 --> 00:55:37.384
but no matter what you say,

830
00:55:38.085 --> 00:55:39.685
I will trust Jae Hyun.

831
00:55:41.815 --> 00:55:42.855
Even if...

832
00:55:43.855 --> 00:55:46.794
he did do something really bad,

833
00:55:48.495 --> 00:55:50.495
I'm the one who must embrace him.

834
00:55:54.964 --> 00:55:56.335
If you keep doing this,

835
00:55:57.665 --> 00:56:00.004
you will ruin all of our good memories.

836
00:56:00.875 --> 00:56:02.074
So Pil,

837
00:56:03.475 --> 00:56:04.875
will you please stop this?

838
00:56:13.484 --> 00:56:15.455
This is the last time I come to see you...

839
00:56:16.015 --> 00:56:17.225
late at night like this.

840
00:56:19.085 --> 00:56:20.824
I came to tell you that.

841
00:56:22.154 --> 00:56:23.165
Goodbye, then.

842
00:57:00.594 --> 00:57:02.935
- I'm here! - Goodness.

843
00:57:02.935 --> 00:57:04.504
- Guys! - Goodness, sir.

844
00:57:04.504 --> 00:57:06.404
You're drunk again.

845
00:57:06.404 --> 00:57:08.574
Yes, I am. That's why I'm here.

846
00:57:08.574 --> 00:57:09.904
I'm sleeping over tonight.

847
00:57:09.904 --> 00:57:12.174
Sir, you cannot go in.

848
00:57:12.174 --> 00:57:14.714
We really don't have any rooms tonight.

849
00:57:14.714 --> 00:57:16.685
I'll take you back to your house. Let's go.

850
00:57:16.685 --> 00:57:19.285
Do you know how scary my wife is?

851
00:57:19.285 --> 00:57:21.815
You always tell me to go home.

852
00:57:21.815 --> 00:57:24.125
- I'm sleeping over. - Goodness.

853
00:57:24.884 --> 00:57:27.824
Sir, your wife is in there right now.

854
00:57:27.824 --> 00:57:29.964
What? My wife?

855
00:57:30.824 --> 00:57:31.824
- Go. - Goodbye, then.

856
00:57:31.824 --> 00:57:34.065
- Yes, hurry up. - Yes.

857
00:57:34.065 --> 00:57:35.194
Be careful.

858
00:57:35.935 --> 00:57:37.964
Will he be all right? This isn't his first time.

859
00:57:37.964 --> 00:57:39.605
Of course.

860
00:57:39.975 --> 00:57:41.504
And stop drinking!

861
00:57:48.044 --> 00:57:49.114
Hey, Manhole.

862
00:57:49.844 --> 00:57:51.044
I really...

863
00:57:51.585 --> 00:57:53.285
have to go back.

864
00:57:55.955 --> 00:57:57.384
Are you telling me to just live this life?

865
00:58:01.254 --> 00:58:03.864
Let's see who will become the last one standing.

866
00:58:04.024 --> 00:58:05.294
Let's do this.

867
00:58:51.105 --> 00:58:52.205
Darn it.

868
00:58:59.145 --> 00:59:01.015
I couldn't travel back in time again.

869
00:59:02.085 --> 00:59:04.324
If this goes on, it'll all end here.

870
00:59:13.565 --> 00:59:14.565
Goodness.

871
00:59:15.734 --> 00:59:18.305
Oh, gosh.

872
00:59:18.565 --> 00:59:19.805
I'm so sleepy.

873
00:59:20.674 --> 00:59:24.145
Regardless, I should still sleep at home.

874
00:59:33.315 --> 00:59:34.315
My gosh.

875
00:59:35.984 --> 00:59:39.685
Why can't I seem to get sober? My gosh.

876
00:59:41.094 --> 00:59:44.265
I'll never drink again.

877
00:59:45.065 --> 00:59:46.634
Mr. Cheon, that darned man.

878
00:59:50.234 --> 00:59:51.335
What's going on?

879
01:00:00.614 --> 01:00:01.975
Hey, please stop.

880
01:00:07.455 --> 01:00:08.585
Of course.

881
01:00:10.484 --> 01:00:11.654
Yes.

882
01:00:14.824 --> 01:00:16.694
Yes, sure. Jung Ae.

883
01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:19.725
Good night, and dream of me.

884
01:00:21.265 --> 01:00:23.205
I mean, have a pig dream.

885
01:00:23.705 --> 01:00:25.364
It's for good luck.

886
01:00:27.435 --> 01:00:28.634
Yes, good night.

887
01:00:43.114 --> 01:00:44.125
What's that?

888
01:01:04.605 --> 01:01:05.605
Hey, Goo Gil.

889
01:01:06.105 --> 01:01:07.274
Hey, Pil.

890
01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:10.714
This guy here is beating someone up.

891
01:01:10.984 --> 01:01:13.815
- An assault? - Yes, exactly.

892
01:01:13.815 --> 01:01:15.015
Where are you right now?

893
01:01:17.055 --> 01:01:19.555
I'm at the back alley of the supermarket.

894
01:01:32.165 --> 01:01:33.234
Pil.

895
01:01:34.475 --> 01:01:35.535
Give me a second.

896
01:01:48.815 --> 01:01:52.085
- Are you all right? - I'm sorry.

897
01:01:52.085 --> 01:01:53.725
Look at your face. Goodness.

898
01:01:55.024 --> 01:01:56.024
What do you want?

899
01:02:09.475 --> 01:02:11.344
Hello? Goo Gil. Goo Gil.

900
01:02:13.475 --> 01:02:14.475
Can you hear me?

901
01:02:15.044 --> 01:02:16.245
What's going on?

902
01:02:34.165 --> 01:02:35.464
Are you okay?

903
01:02:37.634 --> 01:02:38.634
Goo Gil.

904
01:02:47.274 --> 01:02:48.274
Goo Gil.

905
01:02:53.855 --> 01:02:54.855
Goo Gil.

906
01:02:55.785 --> 01:02:56.924
Goo Gil. Goo Gil!
