1
00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:11.141
It's going to be bad if the ratings go down after today's episode.

2
00:00:11.372 --> 00:00:14.511
The tone of your voice makes it sound you're on a picnic.

3
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:16.642
I'm trying to smile, so that blessings will come my way.

4
00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:22.952
What's Hong Ah up to?

5
00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:26.322
Here she is. Speak of the devil.

6
00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:27.822
Hey.

7
00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:29.421
What's wrong with you?

8
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:31.691
You don't even have the right to be an assistant writer.

9
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:35.731
Hyun Soo, here's a gift for you. Open it.

10
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:36.761
What is it?

11
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:42.472
I still have some left.

12
00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:44.401
You look really tired these days.

13
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.871
You can't let your skin get ruined just because your drama's failing.

14
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:50.072
Why do you have to poke her where it hurts?

15
00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:51.212
It's a fact.

16
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:53.981
You're the one who's being overly protective of her.

17
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:55.182
Okay, I'll use it.

18
00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:56.612
Then you guys won't have to fight, right?

19
00:00:58.581 --> 00:00:59.881
Don't you need to wash your face first?

20
00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:02.352
It's okay. I'm just going to apply it again after I wash my face later.

21
00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:08.262
- Hyun Soo. - Yes?

22
00:01:10.092 --> 00:01:12.601
Can you take my name off the assistant writer list?

23
00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:16.972
Why? That's the reason everyone wants to become an assistant writer.

24
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:18.101
That's not the case for me.

25
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:20.472
Okay, then. Hey, Kyung.

26
00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:22.842
Call the staff, and ask them to get rid of Hong Ah's name from the list.

27
00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:24.181
Okay.

28
00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.241
You're really strange.

29
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:28.952
We still have time before today's episode airs.

30
00:01:28.952 --> 00:01:30.782
Let's order something. I'll buy.

31
00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:33.252
Did something good happen to you today?

32
00:01:33.252 --> 00:01:34.321
It's the opposite.

33
00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:38.321
Hong Ah tends to spend money whenever something upsetting...

34
00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:40.161
happens to her.

35
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.431
What's there for her to get upset about?

36
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:43.961
Do you know everything about me?

37
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:47.732
You and I are stuck together for over 10 hours every day.

38
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:52.002
Don't be mistaken. That doesn't mean we share anything during that time.

39
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:54.012
You guys, that's enough.

40
00:01:54.012 --> 00:01:56.441
I'll buy today. What do you want to eat?

41
00:01:57.112 --> 00:01:58.211
I want stir-fried seafood noodles.

42
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:09.951
Stir-fried seafood noodles is one of the dishes that are easy to make.

43
00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:13.631
This dish personally reminds me of my mother.

44
00:02:14.062 --> 00:02:16.462
This was what she used to cook for me as a late-night meal.

45
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:18.932
It's a meaningful dish to me.

46
00:02:53.032 --> 00:02:55.032
Why is he running on the beach all of a sudden?

47
00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:57.302
Does that make sense?

48
00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.441
It's a good image though. It's vast.

49
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.372
But the image doesn't fit with the story.

50
00:03:31.101 --> 00:03:32.272
Is it the ratings?

51
00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:35.772
I told you. Ratings go up for fight scenes.

52
00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:40.082
The story becomes unrealistic if they shoot it like that.

53
00:03:40.082 --> 00:03:41.911
It feels like a drama.

54
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:43.111
But it is a drama.

55
00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:46.451
My gosh. I think the ratings will drop from last week.

56
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:48.391
No, you don't know yet.

57
00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:50.562
This live chart isn't even that exact.

58
00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:52.992
It's not exact, but it's pretty similar.

59
00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:56.092
I'm going to bed.

60
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:58.532
Be safe when you leave, Hong Ah.

61
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:01.071
I'm not leaving. I'm going to stay the night here.

62
00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:03.272
- Okay. - Good night.

63
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:43.041
Writer Lee Hyun Soo, I support you.

64
00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:45.741
(You've liked the comment.)

65
00:04:45.741 --> 00:04:49.152
I wish I could like this comment 10 times.

66

(Director Min Yi Bok)

70
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:53.882
Yes, Director Min.

71
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:55.952
Did you see the ratings?

72
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:59.022
The ratings dropped for the department store scene...

73
00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:00.392
that you told me to shoot as is on the script.

74
00:06:00.392 --> 00:06:03.892
Ratings went up for the action scene that I changed to an empty lot.

75
00:06:04.022 --> 00:06:06.121
This is the difference between professionals and amateurs.

76

(Park Jung Woo)

77
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:47.402
Yes, Mr. Park.

78
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:50.942
You sound cheery. You didn't see the ratings?

79
00:06:51.241 --> 00:06:52.601
I saw it.

80
00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:54.942
I'm sorry. Looks like you'll see some loss because of me.

81

Lee Hyun Soo.

82
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.382
You have to think of yourself first in situations like this.

83
00:07:04.452 --> 00:07:06.822
I'm escaping right now. I'm eating something.

84
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:10.222
If you're escaping by eating, I see that you're doing okay.

85
00:07:13.061 --> 00:07:14.092
To be honest,

86
00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:17.001
I'm scared.

87
00:07:18.332 --> 00:07:19.632
Are you being a woman right now?

88
00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:22.431
Then I'll take it.

89
00:07:22.772 --> 00:07:23.942
No.

90
00:07:24.642 --> 00:07:25.942
Look straight.

91
00:07:26.942 --> 00:07:29.611
That way you can get up even if you fall again.

("Ratings for SBC's 'Unruly Detectives' Reaches All Time Low")

93
00:07:51.361 --> 00:07:52.702
What do we do?

94
00:07:52.702 --> 00:07:55.132
She must have seen it and gone out to roam around.

95
00:07:55.532 --> 00:07:56.632
("Reaches All Time Low")

96
00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:00.171
Why did she go all out when she gets scared so easily?

97
00:08:00.342 --> 00:08:02.111
She's going to take the blame.

98
00:08:02.142 --> 00:08:03.611
What do you mean blame?

99
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:07.082
When ratings drop like this, someone has to be sacrificed.

100
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:08.811
Whose fault is it?

101
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:10.751
Why is it Hyun Soo's fault?

102
00:08:10.921 --> 00:08:12.782
She went on set.

103
00:08:12.782 --> 00:08:15.192
She exposed problems going on inside.

104
00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:16.892
She'll become the target.

105
00:08:16.921 --> 00:08:17.991
Why would you say that?

106
00:08:19.022 --> 00:08:20.161
Fine, you're right.

107
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:22.991
You're awfully sharp sometimes.

108
00:08:23.491 --> 00:08:26.001
It's not sometimes. I'm always like this.

109
00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:28.801
It's Hyun Soo.

110
00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:31.541

111
00:08:32.142 --> 00:08:33.542
Stay calm.

112
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:36.572
I can't pretend to be fine in front of you guys too.

113
00:08:36.572 --> 00:08:38.412
Should I get you a cup of tea?

114
00:08:38.582 --> 00:08:40.141
That'd be great.

115
00:08:40.351 --> 00:08:42.052
I'll come out after sending the script for episode eight.

116
00:08:43.412 --> 00:08:44.851
Yes, this is Ji Hong Ah.

117
00:08:44.851 --> 00:08:46.251
Congratulations.

118
00:08:46.322 --> 00:08:50.422
Your script has been selected as the winner for HNC's drama competition.

119
00:08:50.422 --> 00:08:51.592
Really?

120
00:08:53.062 --> 00:08:54.861
When is the award ceremony?

121
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:58.231
Okay. Thank you.

122
00:09:00.572 --> 00:09:02.231
What award ceremony?

123
00:09:02.231 --> 00:09:05.042
My script won HNC's drama series competition.

124
00:09:06.771 --> 00:09:09.072
You submitted your script to the competition?

125
00:09:09.072 --> 00:09:10.111
When?

126
00:09:10.611 --> 00:09:12.511
- That's amazing. - Congratulations.

127
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:14.611
- Hyun Soo. - My goodness.

128
00:09:14.682 --> 00:09:16.781
This is the beginning for you.

129
00:09:16.881 --> 00:09:18.021
Congratulations.

130
00:09:19.422 --> 00:09:22.092
Thank you. Work hard.

131
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:24.922
I work really hard even now.

132
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:28.062
Winning competitions requires luck.

133
00:09:28.062 --> 00:09:30.092
You don't win just by writing well.

134
00:09:30.401 --> 00:09:33.131
The scripts that make the final cut are pretty much the same.

135
00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:35.401
From that point, it just depends on the jury's tastes.

136
00:09:35.501 --> 00:09:37.401
- So... - Hyun Soo.

137
00:09:37.601 --> 00:09:39.771
Can't we just focus on congratulating me?

138
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.111
If you say I just got lucky, I feel like you're belittling my efforts.

139
00:09:43.781 --> 00:09:45.942
You have no idea how hard I tried.

140
00:09:45.942 --> 00:09:48.212
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:48.452 --> 00:09:49.511
I'm sorry too.

142
00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:51.621
What are you sorry about?

143
00:09:51.881 --> 00:09:53.621
I got jealous for half a second.

144
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:55.452
Good for you, Ji Hong Ah!

145
00:09:55.722 --> 00:09:57.922
You have everything now.

146
00:09:58.422 --> 00:10:00.692
Writer Ji, do you want a cup of tea too?

147
00:10:00.692 --> 00:10:02.031
Kyung, you're the best.

148
00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:06.802
Can I leave?

149
00:10:06.802 --> 00:10:07.901
I have to tell the news to a lot of people.

150
00:10:07.901 --> 00:10:09.972
Go ahead. Your mom will be so happy.

151
00:10:13.472 --> 00:10:14.611
Thank you.

152
00:10:15.572 --> 00:10:17.582
I know things are tough for you,

153
00:10:17.741 --> 00:10:20.111
but I have to respect my life too.

154
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.682
I have to be happy on a day like this.

155
00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:25.151
That's why I like you.

156
00:10:26.121 --> 00:10:28.592
If you didn't get all happy because of me,

157
00:10:28.592 --> 00:10:30.292
I would have felt more miserable.

158
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:34.462
Hurry.

159
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.121
Kyung Soo.

160
00:11:04.462 --> 00:11:06.192
This is good.

161
00:11:07.462 --> 00:11:09.631
Why aren't you eating the pasta?

162
00:11:10.162 --> 00:11:11.202
Do I have to?

163
00:11:11.631 --> 00:11:13.001
That doesn't seem right.

164
00:11:13.001 --> 00:11:15.172
The jamppong and bibimguksu are both spicy.

165
00:11:15.401 --> 00:11:18.172
It makes me strongly suspect that you're purposely avoiding my dishes.

166
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:20.842
I eat what I want to eat.

167
00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:23.312
You have a habit of doubting everyone's intentions.

168
00:11:23.312 --> 00:11:24.412
Fix it.

169
00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:26.682
Exactly what I wanted to say.

170
00:11:26.712 --> 00:11:27.851
Fix it.

171
00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:31.552
Hi Hong Ah.

172
00:11:32.452 --> 00:11:33.952
You guys are eating.

173
00:11:35.552 --> 00:11:36.651
What's up?

174
00:11:37.592 --> 00:11:39.861
Is Jung Sun here? I don't see him.

175
00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:42.031
He went to film for "Star's Favorite Dish" today.

176
00:11:42.031 --> 00:11:43.062
Why?

177
00:11:44.562 --> 00:11:45.631
Just...

178
00:11:46.432 --> 00:11:47.601
Do you want to eat with us?

179
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:49.432
No, I'll be on my way.

180
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:00.381
Is everything okay?

181
00:12:02.611 --> 00:12:05.182
Won Joon, you're such a great guy.

182
00:12:05.222 --> 00:12:08.322
You're such a great guy, but why don't I have any feelings for you?

183
00:12:09.592 --> 00:12:10.822
That hurt.

184
00:12:10.822 --> 00:12:13.521
Won Joon, my script won.

185
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:15.792
The HNC station called me today.

186
00:12:16.092 --> 00:12:17.261
Really?

187
00:12:17.631 --> 00:12:19.631
Ji Hong Ah!

188
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:26.672
You finally did it.

189
00:12:26.672 --> 00:12:27.871
I did it.

190
00:12:28.212 --> 00:12:29.611
Be a nice person now.

191
00:12:30.312 --> 00:12:32.381
And this was going so well.

192
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:34.182
When have I ever been not nice?

193
00:12:35.812 --> 00:12:38.281
But what time does Jung Sun start shooting?

194
00:12:39.682 --> 00:12:41.292
After getting makeup done,

195
00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:43.052
we'll proceed the day following this order.

196
00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:45.162
The other chef is already here.

197
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:48.832
We cook a dish for the star, and a dish we want, right?

198
00:12:48.832 --> 00:12:51.031
Yes. You would need to think quick.

199
00:12:51.031 --> 00:12:53.361
You won't know the dish they want until we start the shoot.

200
00:12:53.361 --> 00:12:54.802
(Green room)

201
00:12:54.932 --> 00:12:56.672
I'll come back just before we start.

202
00:12:56.672 --> 00:12:57.672
Okay.

203
00:13:01.912 --> 00:13:03.542
(Hong Ah)

204
00:13:05.342 --> 00:13:06.342
Yes?

205
00:13:06.381 --> 00:13:08.052
Are you not recording yet?

206
00:13:08.682 --> 00:13:10.212
I thought I'd call just in case.

207
00:13:10.822 --> 00:13:12.952
If you thought I was shooting, why did you call?

208
00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:17.491
I got picked.

209
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:19.521
I was selected for a series at HNC.

210
00:13:20.092 --> 00:13:22.062
Really? Congratulations.

211
00:13:22.592 --> 00:13:24.261
I don't like your reaction.

212
00:13:24.531 --> 00:13:26.832
I wanted you to be the first to congratulate me,

213
00:13:26.832 --> 00:13:28.572
so I even went to Good Soup.

214
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:31.901
Good job, Hong Ah. Congratulations.

215
00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:35.842
Words don't count. Buy me a nice meal later.

216
00:13:36.271 --> 00:13:37.881
I'll wait for you at Good Soup.

217
00:13:38.542 --> 00:13:39.542
Okay.

218
00:13:50.566 --> 00:13:53.798
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E12 Temperature of Love "Congratulate Me"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

219
00:14:03.401 --> 00:14:06.241
Are you my opponent today?

220
00:14:10.042 --> 00:14:11.381
Hello, sir.

221
00:14:12.842 --> 00:14:14.851
You were always lucky.

222
00:14:15.452 --> 00:14:16.922
How did you get this far?

223
00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:19.121
I look forward to it.

224
00:14:19.682 --> 00:14:21.792
All right, let's give it a go.

225
00:14:22.251 --> 00:14:24.962
I want to see how far your luck will take you.

226
00:14:28.062 --> 00:14:29.462
Please sit down over here.

227
00:14:32.832 --> 00:14:34.202
Did you stay up all night?

228
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:36.401
You look tired.

229
00:14:36.871 --> 00:14:38.871
How can I sleep well in a situation like this?

230
00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:44.042
Don't take this to heart.

231
00:14:45.141 --> 00:14:47.781
When a child's marks are low, the parents get him a tutor...

232
00:14:48.212 --> 00:14:50.651
or change the way he studies.

233
00:14:50.722 --> 00:14:52.851
If the director and the writer...

234
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.491
agree to keep trying, I can't touch a thing.

235
00:14:55.792 --> 00:14:59.222
But the director isn't happy about the writing, and the rating is low.

236
00:15:00.391 --> 00:15:01.991
I have no other choice.

237
00:15:06.302 --> 00:15:07.901
Let's get one more writer.

238
00:15:09.932 --> 00:15:11.371
Do you know anyone you're close with?

239
00:15:11.371 --> 00:15:12.702
Someone you could work with.

240
00:15:14.741 --> 00:15:16.312
I'll think about it.

241
00:15:20.312 --> 00:15:21.812
You didn't hear about what happened on set, right?

242
00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:26.452
Do you know what Shin Ha Rim is doing right now?

243
00:15:29.822 --> 00:15:31.692
Ha Rim, please.

244
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:34.062
We can't waste any more time.

245
00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:36.462
I asked for an edit, but I didn't get one.

246
00:15:36.462 --> 00:15:38.062
I'll edit it in the shoot.

247
00:15:38.131 --> 00:15:40.432
My emotions...

248
00:15:43.302 --> 00:15:45.771
I can't get into character. Okay?

249
00:15:46.271 --> 00:15:47.271
Let's shoot tomorrow.

250
00:15:47.611 --> 00:15:49.842
The show will air next week.

251
00:15:49.942 --> 00:15:52.682
How can I shoot when it's not fun?

252
00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:55.682
I couldn't sleep for two days.

253
00:15:56.452 --> 00:15:59.781
None of us slept well, okay?

254
00:16:00.322 --> 00:16:01.621
Shoot someone else first.

255
00:16:03.521 --> 00:16:05.322
Hey. Ha Rim!

256
00:16:05.322 --> 00:16:08.662
Hey! Hey! How can you leave? Hey!

257
00:16:08.662 --> 00:16:11.731
Today's star has a baby face and a talent in acting.

258
00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:14.231
She has been loved ever since her debut.

259
00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:16.731
If you compare her to a book, she's a steady seller.

260
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:20.712
Today, Lee Deul Lae is here on "Star's Favorite Dish".

261
00:16:20.712 --> 00:16:22.771
I heard that you want to eat French food.

262
00:16:22.771 --> 00:16:24.641
There's something called bouillabaisse.

263
00:16:24.641 --> 00:16:28.381
I had it in France when I went there for my honeymoon.

264
00:16:28.381 --> 00:16:30.052
- I see. - I...

265
00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:31.952
was really happy then.

266
00:16:32.952 --> 00:16:37.261
She wants to eat bouillabaisse and remember her happy moments.

267
00:16:37.261 --> 00:16:38.261
This is it.

268
00:16:38.261 --> 00:16:41.491
This is the reason why our show exists.

269
00:16:41.491 --> 00:16:43.601
Chefs, did you hear her well?

270
00:16:43.662 --> 00:16:44.962
- Yes. - Great.

271
00:16:45.202 --> 00:16:49.202
Please make the bouillabaisse Lee Deul Lae had on her honeymoon,

272
00:16:49.202 --> 00:16:51.901
and a dish that will compliment...

273
00:16:51.901 --> 00:16:54.141
the bouillabaisse.

274
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:57.912
I'll give you 40 minutes to cook.

275
00:16:58.042 --> 00:17:00.682
Please start now.

276
00:17:04.781 --> 00:17:07.591
He's fierce as he slices.

277
00:17:17.731 --> 00:17:21.771
I'm excited to see how they'll make bouillabaisse.

278
00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:26.341
The aroma is reaching us now.

279
00:17:26.472 --> 00:17:27.672
- It smells good. - Yes.

280
00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:30.811
I'll go up and have a taste.

281
00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:33.011
It's bouillabaisse.

282
00:17:33.882 --> 00:17:36.652
How will it taste?

283
00:17:36.652 --> 00:17:38.051
I brought a spoon.

284
00:17:38.051 --> 00:17:41.692
Wow. This is almost complete.

285
00:17:41.892 --> 00:17:42.922
All right.

286
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:48.231
It tastes familiar.

287
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:51.331
I took the French bouillabaisse, and added a Korean touch.

288
00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:55.432
That's why it's a little spicy. It brings up your appetite.

289
00:17:56.372 --> 00:17:59.741
I'll now try Chef On Jung Sun's food.

290
00:17:59.801 --> 00:18:01.412
It has a different color.

291
00:18:11.751 --> 00:18:14.222
I can't really tell what this tastes like.

292
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:18.192
Jung Sun is losing his smile.

293
00:18:18.462 --> 00:18:21.132
All right. Please continue with your cooking.

294
00:18:24.402 --> 00:18:27.472
The two dishes taste different for sure.

295
00:18:27.632 --> 00:18:29.672
I'm so excited. I want to try it.

296
00:18:29.672 --> 00:18:30.872
I know, right?

297
00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:55.392
It's time to wrap up.

298
00:18:55.392 --> 00:18:57.031
You have seven minutes.

299
00:18:57.531 --> 00:19:02.571
Chef Lee Jin Wook seems to be finishing up.

300
00:19:02.571 --> 00:19:03.771
He's putting it on the plate.

301
00:19:03.972 --> 00:19:06.402
Chef On Jung Sun...

302
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:08.942
Is there a problem?

303
00:19:09.872 --> 00:19:11.612
He seems to be in a rush.

304
00:19:14.182 --> 00:19:18.021
The lamb he placed in the sous vide machine wasn't cooked.

305
00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:20.021
Goodness, this is...

306
00:19:20.222 --> 00:19:23.922
I'm not sure if he'll finish his dishes on time.

307
00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:28.462
Were there any chefs that didn't finish on time?

308
00:19:28.462 --> 00:19:29.632
- No, not yet. - Really?

309
00:19:29.632 --> 00:19:31.162
We didn't have one yet.

310
00:19:31.162 --> 00:19:35.071
If they're in a rush, even chefs can make mistakes.

311
00:19:35.071 --> 00:19:37.001
- He looks calm. - Yes.

312
00:19:38.741 --> 00:19:42.071
Yes. Chef Lee Jin Wook has rung the bell.

313
00:19:42.071 --> 00:19:43.112
Yes.

314
00:19:43.412 --> 00:19:45.882
Now, the problem is Chef On Jung Sun.

315
00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:49.051
There are three minutes left.

316
00:19:53.952 --> 00:19:56.251
There is one minute left.

317
00:19:56.852 --> 00:19:58.491
I'm worried.

318
00:19:59.291 --> 00:20:03.192
There isn't any time left.

319
00:20:03.491 --> 00:20:06.801
Chef On Jung Sun is putting the food on the plate.

320
00:20:07.071 --> 00:20:08.331
Okay.

321
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:11.372
We'll count down the last five seconds.

322
00:20:13.571 --> 00:20:15.372
Five,

323
00:20:15.942 --> 00:20:21.511
- Four, Three, Two, One. - Four, Three, Two, One.

324
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:23.051
Okay. He finished.

325
00:20:23.051 --> 00:20:27.122
Chef On Jung Sun also rung the bell...

326
00:20:27.152 --> 00:20:30.122
to indicate that he finished.

327
00:20:32.261 --> 00:20:34.531
Shin Ha Rim can't even act. All he does is show off.

328
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:37.132
He's ruining the drama.

329
00:20:37.331 --> 00:20:38.632
Tell him not to come out.

330
00:20:41.402 --> 00:20:42.432
What are you doing?

331
00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:44.672
I'm leaving bad comments for Shin Ha Rim.

332
00:20:46.341 --> 00:20:47.912
(Please cooperate for a cleaner internet culture.)

333
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:51.382
I was reported again.

334
00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:54.612
They should know how annoying Ha Rim is.

335
00:20:55.051 --> 00:20:58.481
If he doesn't shoot, what does he expect us to do?

336
00:20:59.251 --> 00:21:00.591
I'm going home.

337
00:21:01.692 --> 00:21:05.321
Okay. Go home and rest.

338
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:08.291
Someone else is editing it anyway.

339
00:21:09.261 --> 00:21:10.632
Yes.

340
00:21:12.632 --> 00:21:13.672
Hey.

341
00:21:14.872 --> 00:21:16.271
I...

342
00:21:16.531 --> 00:21:18.571
It's okay.

343
00:21:19.102 --> 00:21:21.841
Even if this doesn't work out, you can write something else.

344
00:21:21.942 --> 00:21:23.942
Even if this fails, you'll succeed.

345
00:21:24.811 --> 00:21:26.682
Are you telling me I failed already?

346
00:21:26.912 --> 00:21:30.652
No, I didn't mean that. No.

347
00:21:32.821 --> 00:21:35.751
I shouldn't try to console you in this state.

348
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:38.722
You being here makes me feel better.

349
00:21:40.291 --> 00:21:41.731
I'll go soak in despair.

350
00:21:41.892 --> 00:21:44.061
Come on.

351
00:21:45.102 --> 00:21:46.801
Sleep well.

352
00:21:46.801 --> 00:21:47.801
Okay.

353
00:21:47.902 --> 00:21:49.501
- I'll taste it. - Okay.

354
00:21:49.731 --> 00:21:50.942
- I'm so happy. - Yes.

355
00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:52.071
I've been waiting for this.

356
00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:57.541
I'm trying to keep a serious face, but I can't help but smile.

357
00:21:57.541 --> 00:21:59.412
This dish is perfect.

358
00:22:04.382 --> 00:22:06.152
It's very refreshing,

359
00:22:06.682 --> 00:22:08.192
yet it's full of aroma.

360
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:10.662
It's amazing.

361
00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:12.291
- Now... - Okay.

362
00:22:12.291 --> 00:22:13.291
This one.

363
00:22:19.162 --> 00:22:22.071
Also, here's a bit of information we should note.

364
00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:25.801
Chef Lee Jin Wook and Chef On Jung Sun...

365
00:22:25.801 --> 00:22:27.372
were a teacher and a pupil.

366
00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:30.581
Not really.

367
00:22:30.841 --> 00:22:32.942
He was under me as a line cook.

368
00:22:33.751 --> 00:22:36.281
Are you saying he wasn't a pupil?

369
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:37.551
No.

370
00:22:37.551 --> 00:22:39.682
I see. Okay.

371
00:22:39.682 --> 00:22:40.952
- Lee Deul Lae. - Yes?

372
00:22:40.952 --> 00:22:43.521
Your decision will determine if Chef On Jung Sun...

373
00:22:43.521 --> 00:22:44.862
will beat his master,

374
00:22:45.162 --> 00:22:47.362
or if Chef Lee Jin Wook...

375
00:22:47.362 --> 00:22:50.231
will receive an expected win.

376
00:22:50.862 --> 00:22:53.231
Did you just see your face? Was it that good?

377
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:55.271
It's not that.

378
00:22:56.031 --> 00:22:57.172
No?

379
00:22:57.172 --> 00:22:59.372
It's hard to read her face.

380
00:22:59.642 --> 00:23:01.642
It's time for you to make your decision.

381
00:23:01.872 --> 00:23:04.741
Deul Lae, have you made your choice?

382
00:23:06.682 --> 00:23:08.412
I did.

383
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:10.352
Okay.

384
00:23:11.422 --> 00:23:12.981
- I'll press it. - Okay.

385
00:23:18.362 --> 00:23:20.531
- Bye. - Take care.

386
00:23:26.632 --> 00:23:29.771
Chef Lee Jin Wook's food was more delicious.

387
00:23:30.102 --> 00:23:32.402
He's a great chef.

388
00:23:33.372 --> 00:23:35.071
However, yours made me happy.

389
00:23:35.741 --> 00:23:37.511
I felt like I was in my 20s again,

390
00:23:38.311 --> 00:23:40.952
roaming the streets of Paris with my husband.

391
00:23:41.352 --> 00:23:43.382
Tiring, but...

392
00:23:43.382 --> 00:23:45.952
I felt excited.

393
00:23:47.122 --> 00:23:50.051
Thank you. This is why I cook.

394
00:23:50.692 --> 00:23:52.862
I want to make people happy, even if momentarily.

395
00:23:53.392 --> 00:23:54.531
I was happy.

396
00:24:03.372 --> 00:24:06.001
So? Where is Ha Rim right now?

397
00:24:09.142 --> 00:24:10.341
Okay.

398
00:24:12.011 --> 00:24:13.341
Why are you here?

399
00:24:15.112 --> 00:24:17.581
I'm here to see the chief director because of "Unruly Detectives".

400
00:24:17.952 --> 00:24:20.222
Congratulations on your first win.

401
00:24:20.222 --> 00:24:21.622
What happened with "Unruly Detectives"?

402
00:24:22.291 --> 00:24:24.462
The studio wants a new writer,

403
00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:26.692
and the actor left the scene refusing to shoot.

404
00:24:27.231 --> 00:24:29.061
There's so much bashing criticism.

405
00:24:29.061 --> 00:24:30.231
It's in the worst situation.

406
00:24:31.962 --> 00:24:33.462
So where are you going now?

407
00:24:33.571 --> 00:24:35.102
To see Shin Ha Rim.

408
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:37.771
I'm going to whatever it takes to get him back on set.

409
00:24:37.942 --> 00:24:40.372
I'll beat him if I have to.

410
00:24:41.412 --> 00:24:42.741
Don't be the one getting beat up.

411
00:24:43.212 --> 00:24:44.912
Do you not talk to Hyun Soo?

412
00:24:45.011 --> 00:24:46.682
You two looked pretty close.

413
00:24:47.212 --> 00:24:49.652
It'd be nice to make her something to eat.

414
00:24:51.021 --> 00:24:52.352
Not that she'd take it.

415
00:24:54.122 --> 00:24:55.652
- Let's go. - Okay.

416
00:25:12.372 --> 00:25:13.541
(Kind Soup)

417
00:25:18.712 --> 00:25:20.251
Why are you calling instead of coming here?

418
00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:21.852
I'm sorry.

419
00:25:21.852 --> 00:25:24.581
Something came up, so I can't have dinner.

420
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:29.722
I thought you were going to congratulate me. I'll wait.

421
00:25:29.852 --> 00:25:31.291
I'm sorry, don't wait for me.

422
00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:32.922
I'll cook you something nice later.

423
00:25:35.932 --> 00:25:37.531
Who are you seeing instead?

424
00:26:06.192 --> 00:26:08.761
Did you hear that I'm pathetic too?

425
00:26:10.831 --> 00:26:12.662
Words travel far.

426
00:26:14.731 --> 00:26:16.501
It went too far this time.

427
00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:20.442
Here, I'll do it.

428
00:26:20.442 --> 00:26:22.412
No, I want to do it. This is my house.

429
00:26:22.672 --> 00:26:25.481
You're always treating me. I want to do it.

430
00:26:25.481 --> 00:26:27.412
The one who does it better can just do it.

431
00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:29.551
I'm good at things like this,

432
00:26:29.551 --> 00:26:31.852
so you should do what you're good at.

433
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:45.561
I don't think I'm good at anything.

434
00:26:50.541 --> 00:26:52.541
I'm best at writing.

435
00:26:56.741 --> 00:26:58.581
But look at me now.

436
00:27:09.452 --> 00:27:12.122
Don't look at me like that. My dignity hit rock bottom.

437
00:27:20.632 --> 00:27:21.831
I'm scared.

438
00:27:29.612 --> 00:27:31.382
I'm acting like a woman.

439
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:35.952
I can't believe I'm acting like this...

440
00:27:36.081 --> 00:27:37.481
so that you'd console me.

441
00:27:42.821 --> 00:27:44.622
What are you doing?

442
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:20.462
Are you scared?

443
00:28:29.231 --> 00:28:30.642
(Thank you to Kim Hwan and Choi Hwa Jeong)

444
00:28:42.581 --> 00:28:44.852
(Temperature of Love)

445
00:28:45.722 --> 00:28:47.591
Did you get a chance to read it?

446
00:28:47.591 --> 00:28:50.662
I have to get at least a dime more than Hyun Soo.

447
00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:52.061
I'm afraid that's not possible.

448
00:28:52.061 --> 00:28:53.731
Why are you choosing her over me?

449
00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:55.491
Did I ever ask you to do something for me?

450
00:28:55.491 --> 00:28:57.061
Why isn't she checking her e-mail?

451
00:28:57.061 --> 00:28:58.501
I lost what I wrote.

452
00:28:58.501 --> 00:28:59.501
I came to get my stuff.

453
00:28:59.501 --> 00:29:02.172
Looking at how things are going, Hyun Soo will be fired.

454
00:29:02.172 --> 00:29:04.902
I'll pay you more than her. Come work for me.

455
00:29:04.902 --> 00:29:07.311
Are you doing this because of Jung Sun?

456
00:29:07.311 --> 00:29:09.041
Do you not care about how I feel...

457
00:29:09.041 --> 00:29:10.511
because Jung Sun likes you?

458
00:29:10.511 --> 00:29:13.081
Are you so crazy about a man that you would throw away our friendship?

459
00:29:13.081 --> 00:29:14.652
I'd choose Hyun Soo over anyone.

460
00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:16.581
Don't try to guilt me anymore.

461
00:29:17.081 --> 00:29:18.122
(Next Monday at 10pm...)
