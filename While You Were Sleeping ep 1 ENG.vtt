00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:17.523
(Kyobo Finances)

2
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:12.013
I...

3
00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:14.013
believe in you.

4
00:01:15.412 --> 00:01:16.442
Because it's me,

5
00:01:18.183 --> 00:01:19.752
I can believe you.

6
00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:42.143
My gosh.

7
00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:43.343
(Episode 1)

8
00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:51.852
No way. This is crazy.

9
00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:53.982
Gosh, I really can't believe this.

10
00:01:58.893 --> 00:02:00.523
Goodness.

11
00:02:02.692 --> 00:02:04.563
(On a road)

12
00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.343
What's wrong? Did you have another dream?

13
00:02:17.343 --> 00:02:18.472
(On a road, at night, wintertime)

14
00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:19.613
What's this smell?

15
00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.713
Don't light the candles. Open your window and let the fresh air in instead.

16
00:02:22.882 --> 00:02:26.113
Goodness, your room looks like a pigsty.

17
00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:27.553
(I hugged a man I've never seen before.)

18
00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:29.452
Gosh, it's so crazy!

19
00:02:30.452 --> 00:02:34.192
What's crazy? Look at this mess. It totally looks like a pigsty.

20
00:02:34.192 --> 00:02:37.322
I can't even eat pork because pigs remind me of you.

21
00:02:37.322 --> 00:02:40.563
Not about that, Mom. In my dream, I hugged a man whom I've never seen.

22
00:02:40.563 --> 00:02:42.762
I hugged him first. Mom, you know...

23
00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.673
that I'm not the type to hit on guys first.

24
00:02:44.673 --> 00:02:45.773
Of course I know.

25
00:02:45.873 --> 00:02:47.532
How can you hit on guys looking like that?

26
00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:49.903
If you have any conscience, that is.

27
00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:52.213
Mom, are you really my mom?

28
00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:54.613
Can you please toll the bell for your mom?

29
00:02:54.613 --> 00:02:55.713
Here, Ernest Hemingway.

30
00:03:06.423 --> 00:03:08.963
What does he look like? Is he handsome?

31
00:03:09.863 --> 00:03:11.463
Why does that even matter?

32
00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:12.933
I have a boyfriend, you know.

33
00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:15.833
Hey, you've only seen him twice since the blind date.

34
00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:17.803
Will you marry him the next time you see him?

35
00:03:17.803 --> 00:03:19.532
I hate people who cheat,

36
00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.873
so don't even talk to me about the guy in my dream. Never.

37
00:03:21.873 --> 00:03:23.843
He'll come into your life even if you don't want it.

38
00:03:24.072 --> 00:03:27.373
All of your dreams come true, you know.

39
00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.643
That's not true!

40
00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:37.053
I heard someone's moving into that house. It must be happening today.

41
00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:40.192
Oh, my. Handsome brothers.

42
00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:42.623
Are they really brothers?

43
00:03:43.192 --> 00:03:44.762
Take this already.

44
00:03:44.762 --> 00:03:47.163
People no longer give out rice cakes when they move. It's old-fashioned.

45
00:03:47.163 --> 00:03:49.502
It's not old-fashioned. It's a way to show kindness.

46
00:03:51.473 --> 00:03:52.473
Go on.

47
00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.673
It's him.

48
00:04:00.913 --> 00:04:02.642
He's the one I hugged in my dream.

49
00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:03.683
What?

50
00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:14.663
Hello, I just moved into the house across the street.

51
00:04:14.663 --> 00:04:17.423
Please leave. Do not visit us unannounced like this.

52
00:04:17.462 --> 00:04:20.563
We don't want any greetings or kind gestures. Sorry.

53
00:04:24.103 --> 00:04:26.303
Goodness, what is her problem?

54
00:04:27.832 --> 00:04:29.743
Hey, I told you that I didn't want to do this.

55
00:04:29.743 --> 00:04:31.313
- You didn't smile, right? - You little...

56
00:04:31.543 --> 00:04:32.543
I did.

57
00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:34.613
I had a big smile on my face like an idiot.

58
00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:36.483
Really?

59
00:04:37.483 --> 00:04:39.353
Who would be that rude?

60
00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.053
- Was it a woman? - Yes!

61
00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:43.452
You should date her. You two will make a great couple.

62
00:04:43.452 --> 00:04:44.592
You're such a jerk.

63
00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.262
- Hey. - Gosh.

64
00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:01.743
Mom, you should've given me a heads-up if you needed the car.

65
00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:03.342
Of course I'll be late if I take the bus.

66
00:05:08.543 --> 00:05:09.942
Mom, Mom, Mom.

67
00:05:10.442 --> 00:05:11.853
That guy is here.

68
00:05:12.783 --> 00:05:14.512
The guy I saw in my dream.

69
00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:17.353
Excuse me. Do you mind moving over a bit?

70
00:05:17.353 --> 00:05:18.423
I absolutely can't fall for him.

71
00:05:18.423 --> 00:05:20.293
- Excuse me? - I'll call you later.

72
00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:24.223
Calm down.

73
00:05:24.762 --> 00:05:28.163
I have no interest in him whatsoever.

74
00:05:33.002 --> 00:05:34.272
Why is he sitting right beside me?

75
00:05:34.772 --> 00:05:36.642
3 seats on the left and 2 on the right.

76
00:05:36.642 --> 00:05:38.743
Why did he pick that seat out of them all?

77
00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:41.842
Is he trying to hit on me?

78
00:05:42.512 --> 00:05:45.553
No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions unless I want to embarrass myself.

79
00:05:48.923 --> 00:05:50.082
He followed me.

80
00:05:50.882 --> 00:05:53.192
Then I'm neither jumping to conclusions nor being delusional.

81
00:05:56.063 --> 00:05:57.462
He followed me again.

82
00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:01.192
If I let my guard down, a neighbor will turn into a friend,

83
00:06:01.192 --> 00:06:03.332
then a friend will become a boyfriend.

84
00:06:03.402 --> 00:06:05.402
- I'm not interested in you. - You girls can take these seats.

85
00:06:09.142 --> 00:06:10.743
I beg your pardon?

86
00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:12.413
- Hey. - My goodness.

87
00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:14.043
She must've thought that guy was hitting on her.

88
00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:15.082
- How embarrassing. - Seriously.

89
00:06:15.082 --> 00:06:16.983
- Be quiet. She'll hear us. - She must be mortified.

90
00:06:16.983 --> 00:06:18.512
- My gosh. - Look at her.

91
00:06:18.783 --> 00:06:20.252
I'm embarrassed for her.

92
00:06:21.382 --> 00:06:23.183
Miss, you should take the one across the street.

93
00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:24.592
The next stop is the final stop.

94
00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:27.223
I know that. I can't take the bus to the final stop?

95
00:06:27.223 --> 00:06:29.392
- Did you girls hear that? - My gosh.

96
00:06:30.392 --> 00:06:31.892
Gosh, how embarrassing.

97
00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.832
- It's really embarrassing. - What's she going to do?

98
00:06:33.832 --> 00:06:35.603
- I know, right? - She must be mortified.

99
00:06:38.303 --> 00:06:41.572
We don't want any greetings or kind gestures. Sorry.

100
00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:45.212
That voice...

101
00:06:48.382 --> 00:06:50.842
Oh, wait. You're...

102
00:06:50.842 --> 00:06:54.082
It's the voice I heard through the intercom. You're that rude girl!

103
00:06:54.553 --> 00:06:57.853
It's okay. Don't worry. That wasn't embarrassing at all.

104
00:06:59.423 --> 00:07:00.592
You were good.

105
00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:02.592
You put up a good defense.

106
00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.632
- Mom. - That little...

107
00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.332
I think that dream will come true.

108
00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:08.233
Have you already fallen for that guy?

109
00:07:08.533 --> 00:07:10.033
Is your heart an automatic door or what?

110
00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:12.402
It opens up before anyone even knocks on it.

111
00:07:12.402 --> 00:07:13.473
Like this.

112
00:07:13.473 --> 00:07:16.043
That's not what I meant. That guy is smitten by me.

113
00:07:16.043 --> 00:07:17.173
What makes you think that?

114
00:07:17.173 --> 00:07:20.142
Why else do you think he sat right beside me like that?

115
00:07:20.243 --> 00:07:22.442
You said he did it so that those girls could sit.

116
00:07:22.712 --> 00:07:24.652
He's such a pro.

117
00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:26.783
He has some serious skills.

118
00:07:26.783 --> 00:07:29.882
I think you just have no clue when it comes to guys.

119
00:07:32.923 --> 00:07:33.923
Could I get my bill, please?

120
00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:38.392
1 serving of pork belly and kimchi stew. 17 dollars, please.

121
00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:40.092
Okay. Just a second, please.

122
00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:45.233
- Here you go. - Thank you.

123
00:07:51.942 --> 00:07:53.813
- Thank you. - The food was good.

124
00:07:53.813 --> 00:07:54.842
Thank you.

125
00:07:58.753 --> 00:08:01.153
What's the matter? Do you know that man?

126
00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:03.452
In a dream I had about three months ago,

127
00:08:04.222 --> 00:08:07.352
I saw that man with a bandage on his finger.

128
00:08:08.393 --> 00:08:11.933
It was snowing. As soon as he flicked his lighter for a smoke,

129
00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:13.332
he caught fire.

130
00:08:13.763 --> 00:08:15.462
When? Where was it?

131
00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:16.633
I don't know.

132
00:08:16.702 --> 00:08:18.933
He flicked his lighter with the hand with that bandage.

133
00:08:18.933 --> 00:08:21.003
That means it'll happen soon. My gosh.

134
00:08:22.372 --> 00:08:23.503
Sir.

135
00:08:27.212 --> 00:08:30.143
Sir, could you give me your lighter and cigarettes?

136
00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:31.383
- Why? - Smoking...

137
00:08:31.383 --> 00:08:32.952
is bad for your health. It can cause cancer...

138
00:08:32.952 --> 00:08:36.383
Why do you care? It's none of your business.

139
00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:37.423
Move. Get away.

140
00:08:37.423 --> 00:08:39.393
Sir, you'll die if you smoke.

141
00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:41.722
What is wrong with these women? Are you both crazy or what?

142
00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:43.663
Get lost. Don't block my way!

143
00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:46.192
Gosh...

144
00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.592
For goodness' sake.

145
00:08:47.592 --> 00:08:48.633
Sir!

146
00:08:49.102 --> 00:08:52.173
You have to listen to me. You'll die if you smoke!

147
00:08:52.472 --> 00:08:54.072
You have nothing to lose. Hear me out. Please?

148
00:08:54.072 --> 00:08:55.742
Gosh, you totally ruined my day.

149
00:09:00.442 --> 00:09:02.383
- Gosh. - Hey.

150
00:09:03.283 --> 00:09:04.313
Goodness.

151
00:09:05.283 --> 00:09:07.313
I took this from him. Will it help?

152
00:09:08.683 --> 00:09:10.683
Forget it. It's of no use.

153
00:09:11.592 --> 00:09:13.352
It's his choice and his life.

154
00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:15.722
What are you talking about? We must change it if we know.

155
00:09:30.572 --> 00:09:31.742
We can't.

156
00:09:34.372 --> 00:09:36.143
Who would believe this crazy nonsense?

157
00:09:42.622 --> 00:09:44.653
"I saw you in my dream."

158
00:09:44.653 --> 00:09:46.992
Gosh, where did my lighter go?

159
00:09:46.992 --> 00:09:49.192
"What I see in my dreams always comes true,"

160
00:09:50.163 --> 00:09:51.462
"so if you want to live,"

161
00:09:52.433 --> 00:09:54.033
"you must listen to me no matter what."

162
00:09:57.732 --> 00:09:59.633
Everyone will think it's complete nonsense.

163
00:10:01.842 --> 00:10:04.003
Even Dad passed away like that because he didn't believe me.

164
00:10:07.913 --> 00:10:10.013
The future is unchangeable.

165
00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:13.313
Knowing what will happen changes nothing.

166
00:10:38.742 --> 00:10:44.112
(While You Were Sleeping)

167
00:10:47.482 --> 00:10:49.122
I'll get this cake.

168
00:10:49.153 --> 00:10:51.923
And please give me enough firecrackers.

169
00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:53.053
Is it someone's birthday?

170
00:10:53.492 --> 00:10:57.423
Hey, today is Prosecutor Jung's first day. We should celebrate.

171
00:10:57.523 --> 00:11:00.192
Celebrate, my foot. You're going overboard.

172
00:11:00.433 --> 00:11:02.732
We should celebrate indeed. Let's celebrate.

173
00:11:02.732 --> 00:11:04.332
Let today be a national holiday.

174
00:11:04.433 --> 00:11:05.773
He looks smart.

175
00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:09.273
I know, right? Doesn't Prosecutor Jung look so sharp?

176
00:11:09.742 --> 00:11:11.072
I really like him.

177
00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:13.972
- Look at this. - My goodness.

178
00:11:13.972 --> 00:11:16.143
Ms. Moon, my feelings are hurt.

179
00:11:16.183 --> 00:11:18.683
You used to call me fondly like that when we used to work together.

180
00:11:18.952 --> 00:11:21.013
You're already calling Prosecutor Jung like how you used to call me?

181
00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.622
Gosh, Prosecutor Lee...

182
00:11:23.523 --> 00:11:24.852
Lawyer Lee.

183
00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:26.423
I'll pay for this.

184
00:11:26.722 --> 00:11:28.962
No, you don't have to do that.

185
00:11:28.962 --> 00:11:32.133
It's all right. Today is Prosecutor Jung's first day, you know.

186
00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:33.192
I should congratulate him.

187
00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.803
Do you know him?

188
00:11:34.803 --> 00:11:38.472
Of course. I used to tutor him.

189
00:11:39.202 --> 00:11:41.842
He looks like he's never needed a tutor in his whole life.

190
00:11:41.942 --> 00:11:44.643
What? He always got the lowest grades in school.

191
00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:46.572
- Are you serious? - Really?

192
00:11:46.742 --> 00:11:47.872
I find that hard to believe.

193
00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.753
All right. What does this word mean? Read it out loud for me.

194
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:53.313
(13 years ago)

195
00:11:53.352 --> 00:11:55.283
This is so easy.

196
00:11:55.452 --> 00:11:57.082
"Just". It means now.

197
00:11:57.322 --> 00:11:58.923
"Ice" as in "ice cube".

198
00:11:59.192 --> 00:12:01.263
Together, they're pronounced as "just ice".

199
00:12:01.263 --> 00:12:03.293
It means, "Freeze now."

200
00:12:04.663 --> 00:12:07.592
My gosh, he used to be that dumb?

201
00:12:07.592 --> 00:12:10.803
Poor you. A stupid prosecutor will definitely make your job harder.

202
00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:14.403
Well, he's still a prosecutor.

203
00:12:14.403 --> 00:12:15.742
He can't be that stupid.

204
00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:17.173
My gosh.

205
00:12:25.283 --> 00:12:26.513
I can't stand him.

206
00:12:27.783 --> 00:12:28.822
Hey, Jae Chan.

207
00:12:34.322 --> 00:12:35.362
Is it you, Yoo Bum?

208
00:12:35.362 --> 00:12:37.192
(Prosecutor's Office, Prosecutor: Jung Jae Chan)

209
00:12:37.293 --> 00:12:38.332
(Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan)

210
00:12:39.533 --> 00:12:42.133
Was it two years ago? The work I did...

211
00:12:42.133 --> 00:12:44.433
for the corruption scandal and the serial murder case earned me...

212
00:12:44.433 --> 00:12:46.173
an award from the Public Prosecutor General.

213
00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:48.602
All I did was put down a spoon on a table...

214
00:12:48.602 --> 00:12:51.472
that was already set by Mr. Choi, but I even got an award.

215
00:12:51.472 --> 00:12:52.712
Gosh, that's not true.

216
00:12:53.813 --> 00:12:56.582
Hello, I'm Investigator Choi Dam Dong.

217
00:12:56.643 --> 00:12:58.112
Nice to meet you. I'm Jung Jae Chan.

218
00:12:58.153 --> 00:12:59.153
Oh, this is...

219
00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:01.013
I'm Assisting Officer Moon Hyang Mi.

220
00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:02.653
Hello, I'm pleased to meet you.

221
00:13:09.992 --> 00:13:11.832
- What brings you here? - What do you think?

222
00:13:11.832 --> 00:13:13.763
You're gloriously back as a prosecutor.

223
00:13:13.763 --> 00:13:15.332
I should congratulate you, of course.

224
00:13:15.563 --> 00:13:17.862
You two first met as a tutor and a student,

225
00:13:17.862 --> 00:13:20.332
and now you meet again as a lawyer and a prosecutor.

226
00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:21.403
I guess you can say that.

227
00:13:21.842 --> 00:13:24.673
I just came to say hi. I think we'll be able to help each other out.

228
00:13:24.673 --> 00:13:26.773
You know, a win-win relationship.

229
00:13:28.513 --> 00:13:29.643
Oh, excuse me for a second.

230
00:13:30.683 --> 00:13:32.413
Yes, did you get my text?

231
00:13:32.783 --> 00:13:34.582
Make sure you're free on the 14th.

232
00:13:35.553 --> 00:13:37.383
What do you think? It's Valentine's Day.

233
00:13:38.692 --> 00:13:41.122
The restaurant you've been wanting to check out...

234
00:13:41.322 --> 00:13:42.563
I actually know that place.

235
00:13:42.563 --> 00:13:45.063
Jae Chan, do you know what "win-win" means?

236
00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:51.702
"Win-win"? Is it a Chinese word?

237
00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:57.202
I'll tell you what it is. Your dad said that he'd...

238
00:13:57.543 --> 00:13:59.643
raise my pay by 10 dollars each time your class ranking goes up.

239
00:13:59.773 --> 00:14:00.972
Just give up.

240
00:14:01.413 --> 00:14:03.313
I cannot get better grades for the life of me.

241
00:14:06.653 --> 00:14:08.383
We can fudge your grades on your report cards.

242
00:14:10.622 --> 00:14:13.553
Gosh, my dad is a cop.

243
00:14:13.553 --> 00:14:16.793
What if we get caught? I bet he'll put both of us behind bars.

244
00:14:16.793 --> 00:14:18.633
We can make sure it's not that obvious.

245
00:14:18.962 --> 00:14:21.702
Hey, I'll get 300 dollars more if it goes up by 30 places.

246
00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:23.232
I'll give you half of it.

247
00:14:24.433 --> 00:14:26.433
You said you want a motorcycle.

248
00:14:26.602 --> 00:14:28.702
When will you be able to buy it with your pocket money?

249
00:14:29.872 --> 00:14:32.643
I can make more money, and you can buy a motorcycle.

250
00:14:34.612 --> 00:14:36.683
Your improved grades will make your dad happy too.

251
00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:38.553
All parties involved will be satisfied.

252
00:14:38.883 --> 00:14:40.582
That is a win-win situation.

253
00:14:44.452 --> 00:14:46.393
So you have to come, okay?

254
00:14:46.992 --> 00:14:47.992
All right.

255
00:14:48.592 --> 00:14:51.063
Hey, make some time for me soon.

256
00:14:51.222 --> 00:14:53.793
I'll take you to an amazing sushi restaurant. I'm off.

257
00:14:53.992 --> 00:14:55.102
- I'll get going. - Okay, bye.

258
00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.202
You're leaving already?

259
00:14:56.303 --> 00:14:57.862
- Bye. - Bye.

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

261
00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:27.192
So...

262
00:15:28.403 --> 00:15:31.732
Mom died because of me?

263
00:15:32.173 --> 00:15:33.533
Because...

264
00:15:35.572 --> 00:15:36.942
of the accident I caused?

265
00:15:37.442 --> 00:15:38.742
Hong Joo.

266
00:15:40.143 --> 00:15:43.143
Tell me that this is a dream. Please.

267
00:15:47.283 --> 00:15:49.452
Wake me up. Please?

268
00:15:49.452 --> 00:15:51.053
Pull yourself together.

269
00:16:14.942 --> 00:16:16.342
What should I do?

270
00:16:26.923 --> 00:16:32.193
(Aunt, Mom)

271
00:16:34.033 --> 00:16:39.733
(Because of the accident I caused, Mom...)

272
00:16:49.043 --> 00:16:52.213
Up to 10cm of snow is expected to pile up.

273
00:16:53.182 --> 00:16:55.322
- Hong Joo, eat before you wash up. - The snow will freeze,

274
00:16:55.322 --> 00:16:57.253
so please be careful when you drive.

275
00:16:57.253 --> 00:17:00.592
Hey, why are your eyes so puffy? Did you cry?

276
00:17:00.592 --> 00:17:01.622
Extra caution is advised.

277
00:17:01.622 --> 00:17:02.993
I ate ramyeon before bed last night.

278
00:17:02.993 --> 00:17:04.322
I'm going to wash up.

279
00:17:04.322 --> 00:17:05.963
- Eat first. - A massive explosion...

280
00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:09.332
was caused by a civilian who was smoking while filling up gas.

281
00:17:09.902 --> 00:17:11.973
A self-serve gas station in Osung-dong, Giheung-gu.

282
00:17:12.072 --> 00:17:14.172
A man gets off his SUV.

283
00:17:14.172 --> 00:17:17.642
He puts a cigarette in his mouth and takes the nozzle...

284
00:17:17.642 --> 00:17:19.543
toward the gas tank opening.

285
00:17:19.713 --> 00:17:21.382
As soon as he flicks his lighter,

286
00:17:21.382 --> 00:17:23.842
the oil mist from the gas tank opening catches fire,

287
00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:26.682
and the gas station gets engulfed in flames instantly.

288
00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:30.122
This accident killed the 37-year-old man, Mr. Kim, on the spot.

289
00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:32.523
Hey, isn't he the guy from the other day?

290
00:17:32.822 --> 00:17:34.662
You told him not to smoke. It's that guy, right?

291
00:17:40.132 --> 00:17:41.193
Hong Joo.

292
00:17:43.203 --> 00:17:44.973
Hong Joo! Give it to me.

293
00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:46.672
Hey, let go. Let go of this!

294
00:17:47.102 --> 00:17:49.842
Give it to me. What is the matter with you?

295
00:17:50.342 --> 00:17:55.082
Mom, that man died just like what I saw in my dream.

296
00:17:55.243 --> 00:17:58.382
I know. There was nothing we could do though.

297
00:17:58.852 --> 00:18:00.612
The future doesn't change!

298
00:18:02.023 --> 00:18:04.453
What should I do? Mom...

299
00:18:04.922 --> 00:18:06.723
Mom, what should we do?

300
00:18:07.023 --> 00:18:08.922
Mom...

301
00:18:10.592 --> 00:18:11.793
Hong Joo.

302
00:18:11.793 --> 00:18:13.963
Mom.

303
00:18:17.203 --> 00:18:20.072
Are you saying I'll die because of an accident you'll cause?

304
00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:24.572
And you don't know when it'll be?

305
00:18:28.713 --> 00:18:29.813
Let me see.

306
00:18:30.882 --> 00:18:33.152
You need a flower right here.

307
00:18:35.753 --> 00:18:37.352
- My gosh. - You think this is funny?

308
00:18:37.882 --> 00:18:39.553
Mom, do you find this situation funny?

309
00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:42.063
You saw that the man died just like what happened in my dream.

310
00:18:42.193 --> 00:18:44.793
My dreams have never been wrong.

311
00:18:44.932 --> 00:18:47.263
Is that why you chopped your hair off like this?

312
00:18:47.362 --> 00:18:49.533
Did you think that changing your hairstyle might change what you saw?

313
00:18:49.703 --> 00:18:51.533
I'll never grow my hair long.

314
00:18:52.303 --> 00:18:54.072
I had long hair in the dream.

315
00:18:54.703 --> 00:18:56.243
I had no idea...

316
00:18:56.503 --> 00:18:59.842
that you looked pretty because of your hair.

317
00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:01.713
Mom!

318
00:19:03.382 --> 00:19:05.953
Gosh, don't worry.

319
00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:08.753
I won't die like that.

320
00:19:09.223 --> 00:19:11.152
You're the only one I have in this whole world,

321
00:19:12.023 --> 00:19:14.322
so don't leave me.

322
00:19:15.463 --> 00:19:16.592
Okay?

323
00:19:18.632 --> 00:19:20.162
Gosh, my baby.

324
00:19:23.963 --> 00:19:26.102
You really should wear a flower in your hair.

325
00:19:26.102 --> 00:19:27.132
Mom!

326
00:20:22.023 --> 00:20:23.422
Here are your flowers.

327
00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:29.233
Thank you.

328
00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:36.402
(February 14, 2016)

329
00:20:41.612 --> 00:20:42.682
What are you doing?

330
00:20:45.182 --> 00:20:46.713
Oh, my. Do you have a date?

331
00:20:46.852 --> 00:20:47.882
Hey, Yoo Bum.

332
00:20:48.223 --> 00:20:50.352
My gosh, did you get a new car?

333
00:20:51.922 --> 00:20:54.193
- What brings you here? - I have a date.

334
00:20:54.193 --> 00:20:55.223
- What about you? - What?

335
00:20:55.862 --> 00:20:57.023
Oh, me too.

336
00:20:57.122 --> 00:20:58.932
- Yoo Bum. - Hey, you.

337
00:20:59.693 --> 00:21:01.092
You got a haircut.

338
00:21:08.203 --> 00:21:09.602
Do you guys know each other?

339
00:21:10.043 --> 00:21:11.543
Well, sort of.

340
00:21:15.783 --> 00:21:17.912
By the way, how do you know him?

341
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:20.283
Wait, are you two dating?

342
00:21:20.483 --> 00:21:21.553
Yes.

343
00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:23.422
We're dating, right?

344
00:21:23.422 --> 00:21:24.453
Sorry?

345
00:21:25.322 --> 00:21:26.352
Yes.

346
00:21:26.592 --> 00:21:28.822
Hey, would you and your girlfriend care to join us?

347
00:21:29.223 --> 00:21:30.493
- No, I don't want to. - No.

348
00:21:31.533 --> 00:21:32.533
Fine, then.

349
00:21:32.533 --> 00:21:33.862
It's cold. Let's go in.

350
00:21:33.963 --> 00:21:35.733
All right. You guys should go in. Go on.

351
00:21:35.733 --> 00:21:36.832
See you.

352
00:21:36.832 --> 00:21:40.303
Look at you. You even have a car now. You're all grown up.

353
00:21:40.902 --> 00:21:41.943
Bye.

354
00:21:43.642 --> 00:21:46.612
Was it when he was in middle school? I got him a motorcycle.

355
00:21:46.612 --> 00:21:49.213
My gosh, I think it was over a decade ago.

356
00:21:49.382 --> 00:21:50.943
Jae Chan is all grown up now.

357
00:21:53.513 --> 00:21:56.152
You really didn't steal that motorcycle?

358
00:21:56.822 --> 00:21:59.152
No, I bought it with my money.

359
00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.662
I never gave you that much allowance.

360
00:22:02.662 --> 00:22:04.632
(Winter of 2003)

361
00:22:04.632 --> 00:22:05.932
I earned it.

362
00:22:06.092 --> 00:22:09.003
You earned the money? From what? How?

363
00:22:09.102 --> 00:22:11.402
Chief, we'll question him.

364
00:22:11.402 --> 00:22:12.803
Why can't you answer my question?

365
00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:15.203
Did you steal it?

366
00:22:15.203 --> 00:22:17.473
No. I just used my report cards...

367
00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:20.172
What? Your report cards?

368
00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:22.443
(Report Card)

369
00:22:28.322 --> 00:22:29.983
I manipulated my report cards.

370
00:22:30.553 --> 00:22:33.422
Yoo Bum said he'd be able to raise his rate if we did that.

371
00:22:34.122 --> 00:22:35.523
We split it in half.

372
00:22:36.793 --> 00:22:40.592
Gosh, you punk. Why did you lie about your grades?

373
00:22:41.033 --> 00:22:44.332
Your dad has been going on about how much your grades have improved.

374
00:22:45.003 --> 00:22:46.733
Hey, apologize to him right away.

375
00:22:47.102 --> 00:22:49.172
Dad, this accident is...

376
00:22:53.273 --> 00:22:55.443
- Chief. - Gosh, Chief.

377
00:23:24.713 --> 00:23:26.872
(Mom)

378
00:23:32.412 --> 00:23:33.483
Is something going on?

379
00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:35.553
You keep checking your phone.

380
00:23:35.652 --> 00:23:38.553
I think I should go home early today.

381
00:23:39.092 --> 00:23:40.993
My mom isn't texting me back.

382
00:23:40.993 --> 00:23:43.122
Is she ill?

383
00:23:43.263 --> 00:23:44.892
No, she's not.

384
00:23:45.563 --> 00:23:47.233
I'm just getting a bad feeling.

385
00:23:50.862 --> 00:23:53.372
I blew out the candles.

386
00:23:53.973 --> 00:23:56.872
The stove... I know I turned it off.

387
00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:00.842
The door.

388
00:24:04.082 --> 00:24:05.382
I forgot to lock the door.

389
00:24:05.483 --> 00:24:06.483
Sorry?

390
00:24:07.382 --> 00:24:09.822
I didn't lock the door. I should rush back home.

391
00:24:10.152 --> 00:24:11.223
Well...

392
00:24:12.322 --> 00:24:13.352
Hong Joo.

393
00:24:20.493 --> 00:24:23.003
Mom, please pick up.

394
00:24:25.102 --> 00:24:27.672
Wait, Hong Joo. Have you driven in the snow before?

395
00:24:27.803 --> 00:24:29.273
No, I haven't.

396
00:24:30.102 --> 00:24:32.473
Gosh, what should I do? Shall I take a taxi?

397
00:24:33.473 --> 00:24:35.082
Will I be able to hail one now?

398
00:24:36.582 --> 00:24:38.612
Give me your keys. I'll drive.

399
00:24:39.813 --> 00:24:42.122
- But... - I've driven in the snow a lot.

400
00:24:42.122 --> 00:24:43.453
Give it to me. I'll drive.

401
00:25:19.253 --> 00:25:20.322
Excuse me.

402
00:25:31.872 --> 00:25:33.773
Why isn't she picking up?

403
00:25:33.773 --> 00:25:35.243
Should I call the police?

404
00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:38.713
I'm sure she's fine.

405
00:25:39.743 --> 00:25:41.813
Hello? Mom?

406
00:25:42.943 --> 00:25:45.053
Why did you call me so many times?

407
00:25:48.382 --> 00:25:52.122
No, I left my phone at the cafe.

408
00:25:52.253 --> 00:25:53.822
That's why I missed your calls.

409
00:25:55.922 --> 00:25:57.322
You silly goose.

410
00:25:57.822 --> 00:25:59.493
I'm obviously talking to you now because I found it.

411
00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:01.832
A nice young man found it and returned it to me.

412
00:26:02.132 --> 00:26:03.602
Don't leave your phone behind,

413
00:26:03.602 --> 00:26:05.572
and make sure you pick up right away!

414
00:26:06.332 --> 00:26:08.473
Okay. I'll be home soon.

415
00:26:12.473 --> 00:26:13.612
Thank goodness.

416
00:26:13.773 --> 00:26:15.983
Do you always worry that much about your mom?

417
00:26:17.313 --> 00:26:18.382
No.

418
00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:24.253
Yoo Bum.

419
00:26:27.553 --> 00:26:28.622
If...

420
00:26:30.063 --> 00:26:32.392
If I cause an accident,

421
00:26:34.233 --> 00:26:36.233
will you keep my mom safe?

422
00:26:36.233 --> 00:26:38.233
What are you talking about? What accident?

423
00:26:38.602 --> 00:26:40.832
Well, I'm not talking about right now.

424
00:26:41.372 --> 00:26:43.203
Something like that might happen in the future.

425
00:26:44.872 --> 00:26:45.912
Okay.

426
00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:48.513
No matter what happens, I'll be sure...

427
00:26:48.513 --> 00:26:50.783
to keep you and your mom safe. Are we good now?

428
00:26:53.313 --> 00:26:56.453
By the way, are you really okay? You don't look so well.

429
00:28:13.533 --> 00:28:14.662
Mom.

430
00:28:17.132 --> 00:28:18.303
Mom.

431
00:28:18.402 --> 00:28:20.372
My gosh, look. She regained...

432
00:28:20.372 --> 00:28:21.872
- her consciousness. - Mom.

433
00:28:21.872 --> 00:28:23.342
- My goodness. - Gosh.

434
00:28:23.342 --> 00:28:24.612
- My gosh. - Miss.

435
00:28:24.612 --> 00:28:26.543
- Can you hear us? - My mom...

436
00:28:27.142 --> 00:28:28.243
Where is she?

437
00:28:28.243 --> 00:28:30.013
- Go get a doctor. - Can you see me?

438
00:28:30.013 --> 00:28:31.753
- Is she okay? - My gosh.

439
00:28:31.783 --> 00:28:33.053
Yoo Bum.

440
00:28:34.213 --> 00:28:35.322
Hurry.

441
00:28:35.322 --> 00:28:36.483
Hong Joo.

442
00:28:37.322 --> 00:28:39.293
Ms. Nam, do you see me?

443
00:28:39.753 --> 00:28:41.362
How many fingers do you see?

444
00:28:41.563 --> 00:28:43.892
- My gosh. - It must be a Christmas miracle.

445
00:28:43.892 --> 00:28:45.733
- It must be. - Thank goodness.

446
00:28:45.733 --> 00:28:46.733
Where's Mom?

447
00:28:47.362 --> 00:28:49.463
- Doctor. - She'll be okay, right?

448
00:29:01.112 --> 00:29:02.182
My hair...

449
00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:05.682
What happened to my hair?

450
00:29:10.223 --> 00:29:11.223
Aunt.

451
00:29:12.293 --> 00:29:13.493
What's the date today?

452
00:29:13.622 --> 00:29:14.723
Today?

453
00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:17.463
It's Christmas Eve.

454
00:29:21.132 --> 00:29:22.432
Christmas...

455
00:29:23.332 --> 00:29:24.602
has already passed.

456
00:29:25.572 --> 00:29:27.033
It was three months ago.

457
00:29:27.203 --> 00:29:30.943
Miss, you've been here for 10 months.

458
00:29:34.842 --> 00:29:35.842
Aunt.

459
00:29:37.513 --> 00:29:38.813
Where's Mom?

460
00:29:39.682 --> 00:29:40.813
I'll tell you later.

461
00:29:42.523 --> 00:29:45.223
I'll tell you when you're more alert.

462
00:29:45.223 --> 00:29:46.753
I'm totally alert now.

463
00:29:48.162 --> 00:29:49.293
Just tell me now.

464
00:29:54.063 --> 00:29:56.402
I wish you woke up a little sooner.

465
00:29:57.063 --> 00:29:59.372
Your mom did her best to hold out...

466
00:29:59.703 --> 00:30:01.943
to see you regaining your consciousness.

467
00:30:04.172 --> 00:30:05.973
What do you mean?

468
00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:09.443
What happened to Mom?

469
00:30:11.313 --> 00:30:13.553
Because of the accident you caused,

470
00:30:15.582 --> 00:30:17.882
someone died.

471
00:30:19.023 --> 00:30:22.362
My son! My poor son...

472
00:30:23.122 --> 00:30:26.033
Bring him back to life. Bring my son back to life!

473
00:30:31.063 --> 00:30:32.973
Gosh, my baby.

474
00:30:33.773 --> 00:30:37.273
Wake up soon, okay? I'll make delicious food for you.

475
00:30:38.172 --> 00:30:39.973
She had to pay the settlement money...

476
00:30:40.313 --> 00:30:42.043
and your hospital bills,

477
00:30:42.342 --> 00:30:45.682
so she sold everything including her house and the restaurant.

478
00:30:46.253 --> 00:30:48.352
She worked so much that she didn't even have time to sleep.

479
00:30:50.523 --> 00:30:52.693
She only thought about your recovery.

480
00:30:53.253 --> 00:30:56.223
Then one day, she...

481
00:31:12.773 --> 00:31:13.813
Did she...

482
00:31:15.313 --> 00:31:16.513
die?

483
00:31:17.182 --> 00:31:18.612
Yes, she did.

484
00:31:40.432 --> 00:31:42.443
(Dear my daughter Hong Joo,)

485
00:31:42.443 --> 00:31:44.912
(There's 25,000 dollars and 15,000 dollars in my savings accounts.)

486
00:31:44.912 --> 00:31:47.372
(I also have life insurance that you can claim.)

487
00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:49.682
(Don't beat yourself up.)

488
00:31:52.882 --> 00:31:53.983
This must be a dream.

489
00:31:55.822 --> 00:31:56.922
I'm dreaming now, right?

490
00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:58.953
Tell me that this is a dream.

491
00:31:59.852 --> 00:32:00.922
Please?

492
00:32:02.723 --> 00:32:04.263
I need to wake up from this nightmare.

493
00:32:04.993 --> 00:32:06.463
Why can't I wake up?

494
00:32:09.902 --> 00:32:12.902
Tell me that this is a dream. Please.

495
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:15.473
Hong Joo.

496
00:32:16.743 --> 00:32:18.072
I hate this dream.

497
00:32:20.473 --> 00:32:21.743
Aunt...

498
00:32:23.213 --> 00:32:24.813
Pull yourself together.

499
00:32:25.283 --> 00:32:27.483
You might have to stand trial.

500
00:32:29.182 --> 00:32:30.422
What do you mean?

501
00:32:31.152 --> 00:32:32.592
Why should I stand trial?

502
00:32:33.453 --> 00:32:36.162
I didn't even drive. Why?

503
00:32:36.563 --> 00:32:37.963
You didn't drive?

504
00:32:38.563 --> 00:32:40.733
Why do you keep saying that I caused the accident?

505
00:32:41.193 --> 00:32:42.832
I did not drive.

506
00:32:43.203 --> 00:32:46.003
That accident wasn't my fault!

507
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.090
