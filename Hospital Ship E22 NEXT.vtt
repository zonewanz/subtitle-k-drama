00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:17.383
(Episode 22)

2
00:00:46.184 --> 00:00:47.325
Come in.

3
00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:57.234
You should be the one holding an exhibition.

4
00:00:57.705 --> 00:00:59.005
Why are you here?

5
00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:03.334
Chamomile tea.

6
00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:06.045
Have some. It's good when you're tired.

7
00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:10.944
- Thanks. - I should thank you.

8
00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:15.485
Hyun said he'd look after me.

9
00:01:21.824 --> 00:01:24.864
- Thanks for sending him back. - Ms. Choi.

10
00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.164
I know what you'll say.

11
00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:30.664
You didn't send him back.

12
00:01:30.664 --> 00:01:32.964
- That's right. - No.

13
00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:34.705
You did send him back.

14
00:01:35.474 --> 00:01:38.304
I've known Hyun for six years.

15
00:01:38.304 --> 00:01:41.474
I can tell what he's thinking just by...

16
00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:43.274
looking into his eyes.

17
00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:49.315
He used to have that warm, kind glance...

18
00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:50.985
when he looked at me.

19
00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:54.524
Now, he looks at someone else that way.

20
00:01:58.095 --> 00:01:59.824
I don't care.

21
00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:04.664
I don't mind if all I have is just an empty shell.

22
00:02:04.664 --> 00:02:07.375
- Ms. Choi. - But not anymore.

23
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.845
Now, he's all mine. Shell and heart.

24
00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:14.414
- So... - Is that why you lied?

25
00:02:14.644 --> 00:02:16.044
About being sick?

26
00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:20.414
Aren't you overstepping your boundaries?

27
00:02:20.414 --> 00:02:22.215
What do you think of me?

28
00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:25.824
Shall I check for markings that you had any tests?

29
00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:29.394
If you have acute myeloid leukemia,

30
00:02:29.394 --> 00:02:32.264
you must have scars on your pelvis.

31
00:02:33.694 --> 00:02:37.335
Will you tell Hyun?

32
00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:43.134
You should look around carefully before making secret calls.

33
00:02:43.674 --> 00:02:46.144
If you keep on being so careless,

34
00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:49.514
you might end up telling him yourself.

35
00:02:55.514 --> 00:02:57.255
Why are you doing this?

36
00:02:57.255 --> 00:02:59.354
How long do you think you can...

37
00:02:59.824 --> 00:03:01.995
keep him close with those lies?

38
00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:05.065
Don't you know this is all your fault?

39
00:03:05.924 --> 00:03:07.794
He was always on my side.

40
00:03:07.794 --> 00:03:10.734
Even when I was mean and left him a hundred times,

41
00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:13.005
he always took me back.

42
00:03:14.805 --> 00:03:17.805
He would have this time as well if it hadn't been for you.

43
00:03:18.704 --> 00:03:19.875
So...

44
00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:23.275
don't you mind whether I'm lying to him or not.

45
00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:25.185
Just keep your word.

46
00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:29.914
You said you don't care for love,

47
00:03:29.914 --> 00:03:31.924
so even if Hyun hits on you,

48
00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:34.824
make sure you don't...

49
00:03:34.824 --> 00:03:36.824
give into his advances.

50
00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:50.845
Come out.

51
00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:58.984
I know you're there, Nurse Pyo.

52
00:03:58.984 --> 00:04:00.715
You can come out.

53
00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:17.034
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:18.404 --> 00:04:22.134
Nurse Pyo said there's something wrong with the wires.

55
00:04:22.634 --> 00:04:24.105
I'm fixing them.

56
00:04:27.444 --> 00:04:30.584
- Did you hear us? - I don't need hearing aids yet.

57
00:04:31.884 --> 00:04:34.685
- Pretend you didn't. - I should, right?

58
00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:38.185
Ms. Choi needs to get a good hold on Hyun...

59
00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:40.394
if I'm to stand a chance with you.

60
00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:44.165
- Are you going to be silly? - No.

61
00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:47.065
Today, I'll be an honest messenger.

62
00:04:48.194 --> 00:04:50.505
- What do you mean? - I don't know how,

63
00:04:50.505 --> 00:04:53.975
but it looks like Doctor Kwak and I have become rivals.

64
00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:56.774
I like to play fair.

65
00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:58.844
So you'll tell him?

66
00:04:59.074 --> 00:05:00.975
- Can't I? - Don't.

67
00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:03.214
- Why not? - It's between them.

68
00:05:03.214 --> 00:05:04.815
- Moreover... - Moreover?

69
00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:07.555
If he were to hear from us,

70
00:05:07.555 --> 00:05:09.454
he could feel ashamed.

71
00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:12.284
This is fraud.

72
00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:14.855
Wouldn't it be better to feel ashamed...

73
00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:16.725
than be conned?

74
00:05:17.194 --> 00:05:18.225
No.

75
00:05:18.964 --> 00:05:21.295
Depending on the person,

76
00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:24.534
feeling ashamed can be worse than anything.

77
00:05:41.584 --> 00:05:42.855
Are you like that?

78
00:05:43.824 --> 00:05:45.954
Is it worse than anything to be humiliated?

79
00:05:46.894 --> 00:05:49.094
Is that why you're looking out for him?

80
00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:04.144
Okay.

81
00:06:04.975 --> 00:06:06.815
I'll do as you say.

82
00:06:09.175 --> 00:06:11.545
Under one condition.

83
00:06:13.045 --> 00:06:15.855
- What is it? - I haven't thought about it yet.

84
00:06:16.954 --> 00:06:18.555
I'll tell you when I do.

85
00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:20.795
See you.

86
00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:33.875
Oh dear.

87
00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:39.045
What a terrible love triangle.

88
00:06:40.644 --> 00:06:42.444
Should I keep going?

89
00:06:47.415 --> 00:06:53.324
Okay. Heads for go. Tails for stop.

90
00:07:00.394 --> 00:07:02.764
That was practice.

91
00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:11.045
Okay, another practice round.

92
00:07:29.495 --> 00:07:33.865
Make sure you get all the weeds.

93
00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:35.165
You fool.

94
00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:37.964
If you can't cut them, pull them out.

95
00:07:37.964 --> 00:07:40.675
- I'm sick of this. - What?

96
00:07:40.675 --> 00:07:43.204
What's wrong with you? Pick up your sickle.

97
00:07:43.204 --> 00:07:45.574
Hire someone else to do it.

98
00:07:45.774 --> 00:07:47.844
No one does this themselves these days.

99
00:07:47.844 --> 00:07:49.675
You have four functioning limbs.

100
00:07:49.675 --> 00:07:51.344
Why would we hire someone?

101
00:07:51.344 --> 00:07:54.115
Dad, look it up on the internet.

102
00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:56.415
There are tons of people willing to work for a fee.

103
00:07:56.415 --> 00:07:59.685
Stop searching the internet. Do we have money to waste?

104
00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:01.524
That's rich coming from a guy...

105
00:08:01.524 --> 00:08:04.694
who can't keep a job and is between work right now.

106
00:08:04.694 --> 00:08:06.324
You nag too much.

107
00:08:06.324 --> 00:08:08.665
Get a job if you can't stand my nagging.

108
00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:10.665
Get your own place.

109
00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:14.305
What is it this time?

110
00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:18.175
- Bees. - Run! Run!

111
00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:19.274
Run.

112
00:08:23.745 --> 00:08:25.685
- Oh no. - Hey.

113
00:08:25.844 --> 00:08:26.915
Oh dear.

114
00:08:28.384 --> 00:08:29.584
Dad.

115
00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:35.725
911 emergency call center.

116
00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:39.995
- How can I help? - My dad's hurt.

117
00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:44.235
He got stung by bees.

118
00:08:44.235 --> 00:08:45.965
He was running away.

119
00:08:45.965 --> 00:08:48.804
- Where are you right now? - Gogae Island.

120
00:08:50.005 --> 00:08:52.304
Hello? Hello?

121
00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:53.575
Hello?

122
00:08:54.115 --> 00:08:56.144
The caller isn't responding.

123
00:08:56.345 --> 00:08:59.684
We can't serve Gogae Island. Call the Coast Guard.

124
00:08:59.684 --> 00:09:00.814
Got it.

125
00:09:00.814 --> 00:09:02.115
- Chief. - Okay.

126
00:09:02.115 --> 00:09:04.255
Get a speed boat out right now.

127
00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:07.255
The hospital ship's docked at Gogae Island right now.

128
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:08.355
Is it?

129
00:09:09.755 --> 00:09:13.024
We'll deal with it right away. Out.

130
00:09:16.664 --> 00:09:20.674
Emergency patient. Emergency patient.

131
00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:25.975
- Go as fast as you can. - Okay.

132
00:09:33.755 --> 00:09:36.684
Oh dear. A few bee stings got...

133
00:09:36.684 --> 00:09:38.725
the emergency center, Coast Guard,

134
00:09:38.725 --> 00:09:40.995
and even us on red alert.

135
00:09:40.995 --> 00:09:44.225
- We were as busy as a bee. - That's what I'm saying.

136
00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:46.965
Can a bee sting be that dangerous?

137
00:09:46.965 --> 00:09:48.934
My point exactly.

138
00:09:48.934 --> 00:09:51.605
Some soy bean paste is all you need.

139
00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:53.875
Not in this day and age.

140
00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:56.034
It depends on the kind of bee.

141
00:09:56.034 --> 00:09:58.544
Hornets can be deadly. Right, doctor?

142
00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:00.845
Yes. You can get an anaphylactic shock...

143
00:10:00.845 --> 00:10:03.845
- and even die from it. - You can die?

144
00:10:03.845 --> 00:10:05.245
Of a bee sting?

145
00:10:06.085 --> 00:10:10.085
Bees these days are killers.

146
00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:11.154
I know.

147
00:10:11.355 --> 00:10:14.625
In our days, most of them were harmless.

148
00:10:15.225 --> 00:10:16.355
What?

149
00:10:31.144 --> 00:10:32.304
Let's go.

150
00:10:32.404 --> 00:10:34.945
Wake up, sir. Wake up.

151
00:10:34.945 --> 00:10:36.345
- Sir. - Why are they like this?

152
00:10:36.345 --> 00:10:38.085
Is he trying to protect him?

153
00:10:38.085 --> 00:10:39.784
What's your name?

154
00:10:40.085 --> 00:10:43.154
Tae Wook. Tae Wook.

155
00:10:43.154 --> 00:10:44.654
Let's put them on their backs.

156
00:10:44.654 --> 00:10:46.154
- Okay. - Hurry up.

157
00:10:47.695 --> 00:10:48.725
Hurry.

158
00:11:11.814 --> 00:11:13.955
- What's your name? - Tae Wook.

159
00:11:13.985 --> 00:11:16.154
- Sir. - Tae Wook.

160
00:11:16.154 --> 00:11:17.284
Tracheostomy tube.

161
00:11:17.654 --> 00:11:19.625
Inject epinephrine into his muscles.

162
00:11:19.625 --> 00:11:20.755
Okay.

163
00:11:27.595 --> 00:11:29.034
He isn't breathing.

164
00:11:37.245 --> 00:11:39.644
His nasal passage is blocked, and I can't intubate.

165
00:11:39.644 --> 00:11:40.814
Okay.

166
00:11:59.164 --> 00:12:00.235
Scalpel.

167
00:12:04.235 --> 00:12:05.965
You'll slice his neck here?

168
00:12:09.674 --> 00:12:12.804
- Sir. Sir. - Sir.

169
00:12:12.804 --> 00:12:14.414
His heart stopped. Take this.

170
00:12:14.414 --> 00:12:15.945
- Defibrillator, now. - Okay.

171
00:12:25.755 --> 00:12:27.255
- Let's swap. - Okay.

172
00:12:28.595 --> 00:12:30.524
Attach the pads.

173
00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:40.835
- It's done. - Okay.

174
00:12:47.914 --> 00:12:49.715
- Ambu bag. - Okay.

175
00:12:55.585 --> 00:12:57.625
The pads are connected.

176
00:12:57.625 --> 00:12:59.654
Wait for charging to complete.

177
00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.125
Wait for charging to complete.

178
00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:03.764
Move away from the patient.

179
00:13:03.764 --> 00:13:05.365
Clear. Shoot.

180
00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:19.075
It's in.

181
00:13:19.945 --> 00:13:21.174
Good.

182
00:13:26.184 --> 00:13:28.355
Move away from the patient.

183
00:13:28.355 --> 00:13:29.855
Clear. Shoot.

184
00:13:36.054 --> 00:13:37.394
He's back.

185
00:13:50.418 --> 00:13:53.650

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

186
00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:09.995
Doctor, he's waking up.

187
00:14:10.794 --> 00:14:12.365
Are you awake?

188
00:14:12.794 --> 00:14:15.764
- What's your name? - Tae Wook.

189
00:14:17.034 --> 00:14:20.005
- Sir. - My son, Tae Wook.

190
00:14:20.005 --> 00:14:22.575
Your son's still unconscious.

191
00:14:23.205 --> 00:14:25.445
What did you say?

192
00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:28.845
- You need to stay calm. - Where is he?

193
00:14:29.075 --> 00:14:30.814
We'll monitor him for now...

194
00:14:30.814 --> 00:14:32.914
and transfer him when he's stable.

195
00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:33.914
Okay.

196
00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:36.884
Tae Wook. My son!

197
00:14:38.524 --> 00:14:41.355
What's this? Why is that there?

198
00:14:42.195 --> 00:14:44.024
I had to make an incision because...

199
00:14:44.024 --> 00:14:45.865
his nasal passage was blocked.

200
00:14:46.934 --> 00:14:50.465
Why is he in this state when I'm fine?

201
00:14:50.564 --> 00:14:52.634
Because he lay on top of you...

202
00:14:52.634 --> 00:14:54.634
to protect you from the bees.

203
00:14:54.634 --> 00:14:57.174
What... What did you say?

204
00:14:57.445 --> 00:15:00.115
- We'll look after him. - Let go.

205
00:15:01.144 --> 00:15:03.144
You idiot.

206
00:15:03.144 --> 00:15:05.314
Why did you protect me?

207
00:15:05.314 --> 00:15:08.255
You should've run away from the bees.

208
00:15:08.715 --> 00:15:10.225
Why did you...

209
00:15:10.855 --> 00:15:13.054
follow me to protect me?

210
00:15:14.894 --> 00:15:18.164
Tae Wook, are you awake?

211
00:15:21.294 --> 00:15:24.134
What's wrong? Why can't he speak?

212
00:15:24.404 --> 00:15:25.965
It's temporary.

213
00:15:26.404 --> 00:15:29.034
His voice will return when the cut heals.

214
00:15:29.034 --> 00:15:31.505
Why did this happen to us?

215
00:15:34.575 --> 00:15:36.544
Use this instead.

216
00:15:52.095 --> 00:15:53.325
"Dad."

217
00:15:54.564 --> 00:15:57.505
"Sorry for being cranky."

218
00:15:58.934 --> 00:16:01.605
When I get a job next year,

219
00:16:01.804 --> 00:16:04.745
I'll help you with a happy heart.

220
00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:08.875
You fool.

221
00:16:09.814 --> 00:16:13.455
Who cares about the weeds when you're in this state?

222
00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:20.095
It's okay. Don't try to talk.

223
00:16:20.654 --> 00:16:21.755
I get it.

224
00:16:26.465 --> 00:16:28.995
It's okay, my son.

225
00:16:30.465 --> 00:16:31.865
My son.

226
00:16:32.705 --> 00:16:36.674
It's okay. It's fine.

227
00:16:38.105 --> 00:16:39.304
Tae Wook.

228
00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.314
I'm so sorry.

229
00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:46.445
It's okay now, my son.

230
00:16:59.294 --> 00:17:00.965
He wants to pay his debt.

231
00:17:01.394 --> 00:17:03.865
He has nothing to give you as an inheritance.

232
00:17:06.235 --> 00:17:09.034
He can't leave you with debt.

233
00:17:09.034 --> 00:17:12.374
I know what you think of him.

234
00:17:14.945 --> 00:17:17.415
I can't help but feel sorry for him.

235
00:18:04.564 --> 00:18:05.925
Get in.

236
00:18:06.465 --> 00:18:08.135
I'll take a bus.

237
00:18:08.965 --> 00:18:10.465
They're both here.

238
00:18:15.505 --> 00:18:17.505
Shall I drop the bomb?

239
00:18:17.574 --> 00:18:18.645
Doctor Kim.

240
00:18:18.645 --> 00:18:21.044
Get in. That's my condition.

241
00:18:22.044 --> 00:18:24.584
For as long as your dad's at our hospital,

242
00:18:24.985 --> 00:18:28.284
- let me drive you around. - That's unnecessary.

243
00:18:33.124 --> 00:18:34.554
What is it, Woo Jae?

244
00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:37.594
Dad's insisting on leaving the hospital.

245
00:18:44.304 --> 00:18:46.705
- Let's go. - Why did you change your mind?

246
00:18:46.705 --> 00:18:48.834
Don't waste any time. Just drive.

247
00:18:57.284 --> 00:18:59.645
Hyun, shouldn't we go too?

248
00:19:30.784 --> 00:19:33.185
- Dad. - Why are you here?

249
00:19:33.185 --> 00:19:34.715
I drove Doctor Song.

250
00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:38.584
Is her dad very ill?

251
00:19:40.155 --> 00:19:41.955
He wants to go home.

252
00:19:41.955 --> 00:19:43.155
What?

253
00:19:43.594 --> 00:19:45.524
In his condition?

254
00:19:45.524 --> 00:19:47.864
Take extra care of her for a while.

255
00:19:48.165 --> 00:19:49.864
It seems complicated.

256
00:19:50.665 --> 00:19:51.764
Okay.

257
00:19:58.344 --> 00:19:59.645
What are you doing?

258
00:20:01.574 --> 00:20:04.185
- Can't you see? - You won't get paid.

259
00:20:04.614 --> 00:20:06.584
I already informed the insurance commission.

260
00:20:08.554 --> 00:20:09.614
Eun Jae, you...

261
00:20:09.614 --> 00:20:12.284
So stop getting ideas, and get changed again.

262
00:20:12.524 --> 00:20:14.725
Get changed, and lie down.

263
00:20:14.725 --> 00:20:15.824
No.

264
00:20:16.764 --> 00:20:18.165
I won't.

265
00:20:19.824 --> 00:20:22.165
Consider me gone.

266
00:20:22.334 --> 00:20:24.604
You managed without me so far.

267
00:20:24.604 --> 00:20:25.705
Dad.

268
00:20:38.385 --> 00:20:39.844
That's all I needed.

269
00:20:41.314 --> 00:20:43.185
I didn't think...

270
00:20:43.185 --> 00:20:45.554
I'd hear you call me that before I died.

271
00:20:45.554 --> 00:20:47.395
You won't die.

272
00:20:47.824 --> 00:20:49.395
I won't let you.

273
00:20:49.895 --> 00:20:51.864
- Eun Jae. - I'll save you.

274
00:20:52.725 --> 00:20:55.064
I'll save you no matter what.

275
00:20:55.534 --> 00:20:57.304
So don't think about fleeing.

276
00:20:57.705 --> 00:20:59.304
Think about how you'll make up...

277
00:20:59.764 --> 00:21:01.804
and play the father role from now on.

278
00:21:28.564 --> 00:21:31.304
- Take it. - It's okay.

279
00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:33.165
I have money.

280
00:21:33.774 --> 00:21:36.034
Eat proper meals instead of instant noodles.

281
00:21:38.044 --> 00:21:40.945
If he wants to eat something, buy it for him.

282
00:21:41.614 --> 00:21:42.745
Okay?

283
00:21:54.995 --> 00:21:57.965
See if the swelling diminishes where there's a fracture.

284
00:21:57.965 --> 00:21:59.225
Then proceed with the operation.

285
00:21:59.824 --> 00:22:01.395
Did you also hurt your face?

286
00:22:03.735 --> 00:22:06.064
Get the patient's records, and do a CT scan.

287
00:22:06.064 --> 00:22:07.205
Yes, doctor.

288
00:22:07.205 --> 00:22:08.235
Let's see.

289
00:22:08.235 --> 00:22:11.645
- Hello, doctor. - Doctor Song.

290
00:22:12.945 --> 00:22:14.814
I was hoping to change my shift today.

291
00:22:14.814 --> 00:22:17.584
- Is something the matter? - Please, doctor.

292
00:22:17.584 --> 00:22:19.814
Wait a minute. Let me call Dr. Kim.

293
00:22:20.014 --> 00:22:21.354
Are you going to Seoul?

294
00:22:22.155 --> 00:22:23.755
- Yes. - You should go.

295
00:22:23.755 --> 00:22:25.854
I haven't contacted Dr. Kim yet.

296
00:22:25.854 --> 00:22:29.655
If you need someone, I'll be here. You may go.

297
00:22:30.495 --> 00:22:31.665
Thank you.

298
00:22:35.534 --> 00:22:38.165
Finish it up here.

299
00:22:42.104 --> 00:22:43.774
Okay, have it ready.

300
00:22:45.344 --> 00:22:47.774
I called the hospital car, so take it.

301
00:22:48.975 --> 00:22:51.784
- That's okay. - It's not all the way to Seoul.

302
00:22:51.784 --> 00:22:54.685
- Go to the airport. It's faster. - But...

303
00:22:54.685 --> 00:22:58.255
Take advantage of it. I owe you a lot for saving my wife.

304
00:22:59.725 --> 00:23:02.755
By the way, it may not be easy.

305
00:23:02.824 --> 00:23:05.264
I know something happened between you two in the past.

306
00:23:06.124 --> 00:23:09.764
I know Dr. Kim Do Hoon well because he was my colleague.

307
00:23:10.034 --> 00:23:11.235
He's not a bad person.

308
00:23:11.764 --> 00:23:13.475
I don't know if he's a kind doctor,

309
00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:15.604
but he's definitely talented.

310
00:23:17.274 --> 00:23:21.014
As your father's guardian, ask him earnestly and politely.

311
00:23:21.344 --> 00:23:24.844
Then he will make wise decisions as a doctor.

312
00:23:25.314 --> 00:23:26.385
Yes, doctor.

313
00:23:27.185 --> 00:23:29.885
I asked the secretary to reserve a ticket.

314
00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:32.124
Get it as soon as you get to the airport.

315
00:23:32.225 --> 00:23:33.854
Thank you for everything.

316
00:23:33.854 --> 00:23:37.064
Thank me after your father gets better.

317
00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:39.764
There's the car. Go on now.

318
00:23:46.235 --> 00:23:48.304
Why didn't you ask me to drive her to the airport?

319
00:23:49.235 --> 00:23:51.145
She has a lot of pride.

320
00:23:52.304 --> 00:23:56.044
If a man is inquisitive about everything,

321
00:23:56.514 --> 00:23:58.385
she'll feel humiliated.

322
00:23:59.415 --> 00:24:02.485
- She'll tell you to get lost. - Humiliated?

323
00:24:02.584 --> 00:24:05.655
That's right. Is something wrong?

324
00:24:05.655 --> 00:24:06.955
No.

325
00:24:07.554 --> 00:24:10.364
I'm getting lectured on humiliation...

326
00:24:10.364 --> 00:24:12.264
many times today.

327
00:24:19.005 --> 00:24:22.675
(Seoul Daehan Hospital)

328
00:24:55.874 --> 00:24:57.274
(Central Operation Room)

329
00:24:58.945 --> 00:25:01.175
We were so lucky today.

330
00:25:01.175 --> 00:25:03.885
I know. They found a transplant donor.

331
00:25:03.885 --> 00:25:06.385
When the pilot said the helicopter couldn't fly due to the wind,

332
00:25:06.385 --> 00:25:09.054
I wanted to fly it myself. Then...

333
00:25:09.054 --> 00:25:12.155
It was great timing when the wind calmed down.

334
00:25:12.155 --> 00:25:15.225
- I know. - We deserve to celebrate today.

335
00:25:15.524 --> 00:25:17.965
We love you, doctor.

336
00:25:17.965 --> 00:25:19.594
Doctor Song Eun Jae?

337
00:25:22.135 --> 00:25:23.564
It's been a long time.

338
00:25:25.665 --> 00:25:27.705
How have you been?

339
00:25:28.074 --> 00:25:31.804
I'm always the same. What brings you here?

340
00:25:33.415 --> 00:25:36.344
I have a favor to ask of you.

341
00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:38.445
A favor?

342
00:25:50.764 --> 00:25:54.294
- It must be about her father. - Probably.

343
00:25:54.294 --> 00:25:55.735
Will he do it?

344
00:25:57.604 --> 00:25:58.905
Why wouldn't he?

345
00:25:59.635 --> 00:26:02.735
Gosh, how could he?

346
00:26:03.274 --> 00:26:05.945
He was attacked by his own trainee.

347
00:26:05.945 --> 00:26:08.344
Attacked? She only told the truth.

348
00:26:08.344 --> 00:26:10.114
Are you kidding?

349
00:26:10.114 --> 00:26:13.915
If the world values the truth so much,

350
00:26:13.915 --> 00:26:16.584
why was Dr. Song expelled to the hospital ship?

351
00:26:16.584 --> 00:26:19.185
Some people actually enjoy working there.

352
00:26:19.584 --> 00:26:20.955
Don't say, "expelled".

353
00:26:20.955 --> 00:26:23.594
Gosh, you've matured, haven't you?

354
00:26:26.264 --> 00:26:27.435
By the way,

355
00:26:28.435 --> 00:26:30.405
can't Dr. Song do the operation?

356
00:26:30.405 --> 00:26:34.235
Are you just saying that, or do you really not know?

357
00:26:34.235 --> 00:26:37.044
No matter how strong Dr. Song may be,

358
00:26:37.245 --> 00:26:40.245
she can't remain calm during her own father's operation.

359
00:26:40.445 --> 00:26:43.044
It's a perfect situation that calls for trouble.

360
00:26:43.245 --> 00:26:45.844
If something goes wrong and her father dies,

361
00:26:46.284 --> 00:26:49.385
do you think she can continue being a surgeon?

362
00:26:53.124 --> 00:26:54.854
What if she gets rejected?

363
00:26:55.554 --> 00:26:58.165
Gosh, I have no idea.

364
00:26:58.165 --> 00:27:00.064
Of course, I'll do it.

365
00:27:02.135 --> 00:27:04.705
Your father's life depends on it.

366
00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:08.104
What you did was disgraceful, but doing the operation is only right.

367
00:27:08.205 --> 00:27:11.044
- Thank you. - Unfortunately,

368
00:27:11.344 --> 00:27:14.645
I can't free up my schedule because it's already packed.

369
00:27:16.574 --> 00:27:18.915
When I worked with a talented doctor like you,

370
00:27:18.915 --> 00:27:21.915
I could free up a day or two.

371
00:27:22.314 --> 00:27:24.685
However, it's impossible to do that now.

372
00:27:25.225 --> 00:27:28.395
- Professor... - You should find another doctor.

373
00:27:29.255 --> 00:27:31.165
Please consider it one more time.

374
00:27:32.064 --> 00:27:34.935
I feel bad, but I have no choice.

375
00:27:34.935 --> 00:27:37.304
- Professor... - You should leave.

376
00:27:40.475 --> 00:27:41.874
I beg you.

377
00:27:49.514 --> 00:27:51.215
I beg you, professor.

378
00:27:53.755 --> 00:27:57.255
Please save my father.

379
00:28:23.385 --> 00:28:24.814
(Hospital Ship)

380
00:28:24.814 --> 00:28:27.215
The tumor that formed in the biliary tract...

381
00:28:27.215 --> 00:28:30.255
Will you be okay with Dr. Song's operating...

382
00:28:30.255 --> 00:28:31.255
on her own father?

383
00:28:31.255 --> 00:28:33.425
What kind of a person do you want to be as you age?

384
00:28:34.425 --> 00:28:36.764
Come here, and give the flowers to your brother.

385
00:28:36.764 --> 00:28:39.425
I was unbearably angry.

386
00:28:39.425 --> 00:28:41.735
It'll be over when you wake up.

387
00:28:41.735 --> 00:28:43.834
Even if something goes wrong,

388
00:28:43.834 --> 00:28:45.635
it won't be your fault.

389
00:28:45.935 --> 00:28:49.104
Thank you for thinking of me when you're having a hard time.

390
00:28:49.104 --> 00:28:51.945
I want to keep working at the hospital ship.
