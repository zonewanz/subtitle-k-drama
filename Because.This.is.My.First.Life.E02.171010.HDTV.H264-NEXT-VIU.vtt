1
00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:28.344
Thank you for your neocortex story.

2
00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:31.815
I think I've already become a failure in this life,

3
00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:34.754
but I'll try my best.

4
00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:40.855
Good luck.

5
00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:44.965
Going through this life is the first time for all of us anyway.

6
00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:42.285
Today's bus services have ended.

7
00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:44.274
Let's eat.

8
00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:51.654
I don't want to. Why should I spend my weekends with you?

9
00:02:51.654 --> 00:02:54.325
I really want to get together with this girl.

10
00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:56.295
I think she's too shy to meet one on one.

11
00:02:56.554 --> 00:02:58.825
The best part is that her friend is really pretty.

12
00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:00.795
- Did you see the picture I sent? - No.

13
00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:01.795
Come on.

14
00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:05.005
I know you're going to be eating nasty pre-made lunches.

15
00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:06.705
Why won't you come?

16
00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:12.904
Don't derogate how I use my time.

17
00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:15.344
Mr. Ma. You lack compassion.

18
00:03:15.344 --> 00:03:18.214
You can only find self-esteem through your social relationships.

19
00:03:18.214 --> 00:03:20.885
To you, it may seem like they're nasty lunches,

20
00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:22.784
but to me, they're like an oasis.

21
00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:26.255
I have to eat while listening to people like you all week.

22
00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:28.825
Do you know how much stress you people give me?

23
00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:31.265
Hey, it was a slip of the tongue. I'm sorry.

24
00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:34.964
I'll apologize. Let's reset, format, and reboot. Okay?

25
00:03:35.594 --> 00:03:38.034
Please do not bother me when I'm trying...

26
00:03:38.034 --> 00:03:40.605
to have a meal in peace and quiet all by myself...

27
00:03:40.635 --> 00:03:43.135
- after five days. - Yes, it's very important.

28
00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:46.344
It's a very important time. That's it. The conversation is over.

29
00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:47.445
By the way,

30
00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:51.284
who is that person that lives at your place?

31
00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:54.344
Was it Ji Ho? He's nothing compared to you,

32
00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:55.455
but I better take him instead.

33
00:03:55.554 --> 00:03:58.284
All of my friends are busy...

34
00:04:15.105 --> 00:04:17.705
Are you sure you don't want to? He's a really nice guy.

35
00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:19.305
I'm okay.

36
00:04:19.904 --> 00:04:22.115
You know how bad I am at blind dates.

37
00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:24.745
How can a writer for dramas have zero dating experience?

38
00:04:24.745 --> 00:04:28.214
You write kiss scenes, but you've never kissed.

39
00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:30.455
You deserve to be covered in "TV in TV".

40
00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:32.984
Hey, that's such an old show.

41
00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:36.625
Also, kissing isn't a big deal.

42
00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:39.024
What are you talking about?

43
00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:40.565
How would you know that?

44
00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:44.464
I...

45
00:04:44.765 --> 00:04:48.305
I saw it a lot on shows like "TV in TV".

46
00:04:48.305 --> 00:04:49.805
What are you talking about?

47
00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:52.344
You better not be dating without telling me.

48
00:04:52.344 --> 00:04:55.245
No way. I'm not dating.

49
00:04:55.615 --> 00:04:58.645
Hey, Soo Ji. I'm getting a call. I'll call you later.

50
00:04:58.645 --> 00:04:59.984
Okay.

51
00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:03.115
That was close.

52
00:05:04.015 --> 00:05:06.055
Are you stupid? Why would you say that?

53
00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:10.495
What's this?

54
00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:14.094
(Tile and grout cleaner)

55
00:05:15.935 --> 00:05:17.635
Well, it's not that bad.

56
00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:20.505
I'll consider it a gift for the landlord.

57
00:05:22.674 --> 00:05:23.904
It looked natural.

58
00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:42.354
You don't have to date to kiss.

59
00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:44.794
I had my first kiss too.

60
00:05:50.464 --> 00:05:51.464
Are you crazy?

61
00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:54.534
That's not something to boast about.

62
00:05:54.534 --> 00:05:56.135
Good for you.

63
00:05:56.404 --> 00:05:58.645
Thank goodness he was a stranger.

64
00:06:03.544 --> 00:06:04.815
Hello.

65
00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:18.695
Doors are opening.

66
00:06:23.065 --> 00:06:24.094
Thank you.

67
00:06:24.964 --> 00:06:26.505
Doors are closing.

68
00:06:27.334 --> 00:06:28.375
Level four.

69
00:07:00.964 --> 00:07:04.005
Level four. Doors are opening.

70
00:07:14.214 --> 00:07:17.284
What? He's... Kiss...

71
00:07:17.284 --> 00:07:19.524
Why is neocortex... Why?

72
00:07:19.524 --> 00:07:21.055
- Hold on. - Going down.

73
00:07:21.055 --> 00:07:23.125
What? Why did he get off here?

74
00:07:24.495 --> 00:07:25.695
No way.

75
00:07:26.594 --> 00:07:27.765
Does he live here?

76
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:29.765
Doors are opening.

77
00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:40.474
I left my wallet at home.

78
00:07:40.505 --> 00:07:41.945
Doors are closing.

79
00:07:42.174 --> 00:07:44.745
What do I do? What if I run into him again?

80
00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:46.044
No, no.

81
00:07:46.584 --> 00:07:49.084
I better go home first.

82
00:07:49.354 --> 00:07:51.224
That's the safest place right now.

83
00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:08.904
Let's go.

84
00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:14.005
Hurry.

85
00:08:22.515 --> 00:08:23.815
This should do it for now.

86
00:08:24.214 --> 00:08:26.685
I'm safe now that I'm home.

87
00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:28.755
It's okay. I can calm down.

88
00:08:29.854 --> 00:08:32.594
What? Is the owner home?

89
00:08:34.324 --> 00:08:35.564
Delivery.

90
00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:40.865
Gosh. What if he's living on the same floor as me?

91
00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:43.135
No way. That's impossible.

92
00:08:43.434 --> 00:08:45.174
I can be unlucky,

93
00:08:45.174 --> 00:08:47.375
but Seoul is huge. How can we be on the same floor?

94
00:08:49.044 --> 00:08:50.615
I should ask her.

95
00:08:50.615 --> 00:08:52.515
She'll know who her neighbors are.

96
00:08:53.085 --> 00:08:55.184
She has really big feet.

97
00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:58.454
They're 275mm? Is she a basketball player?

98
00:09:03.294 --> 00:09:04.725
Hello, you were home...

99
00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:15.475
Why are you...

100
00:09:16.574 --> 00:09:17.605
here?

101
00:09:21.544 --> 00:09:25.085
(Episode 2: Because This Is My First Kiss)

102
00:09:26.414 --> 00:09:29.085
Why are you here?

103
00:09:29.115 --> 00:09:30.515
That's what I should ask.

104
00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:32.524
How did you get in here?

105
00:09:33.154 --> 00:09:34.184
I just...

106
00:09:34.855 --> 00:09:37.294
This is unit 401...

107
00:09:37.294 --> 00:09:39.524
I live here and stuff.

108
00:09:40.564 --> 00:09:41.595
No way.

109
00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:46.365
Maybe I came into the wrong house.

110
00:09:46.365 --> 00:09:49.304
I'm sorry. They all look the same here.

111
00:09:51.034 --> 00:09:52.204
Bye.

112
00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:56.475
(Se Hee: landlord)

113
00:09:57.715 --> 00:09:58.944
Hello?

114
00:09:59.444 --> 00:10:00.544
Hello.

115
00:10:09.395 --> 00:10:10.755
Are you Yoon Ji Ho?

116
00:10:11.725 --> 00:10:12.725
Yes?

117
00:10:27.145 --> 00:10:28.774
Hot, hot, hot.

118
00:10:30.574 --> 00:10:33.485
Okay. Nice to meet you.

119
00:10:33.485 --> 00:10:34.654
Give me your feet.

120
00:10:34.654 --> 00:10:35.654
Now, we'll...

121
00:10:35.654 --> 00:10:37.184
What are you doing? They stink.

122
00:10:37.184 --> 00:10:40.154
I smelled them for seven years. It's not anything new.

123
00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:43.625
Look. It's all tense.

124
00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:44.895
What did I tell you?

125
00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:47.324
You need to take breaks and sit down in a washroom stall.

126
00:10:50.434 --> 00:10:52.434
Right. Is it today?

127
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:54.105
Today? What's today?

128
00:10:56.635 --> 00:10:58.005
Is it a special day?

129
00:10:59.274 --> 00:11:01.845
No, never mind. It was yesterday.

130
00:11:01.845 --> 00:11:03.745
Yesterday? It can't be yesterday.

131
00:11:03.745 --> 00:11:07.345
I checked everything. It wasn't an anniversary or anything.

132
00:11:08.115 --> 00:11:09.985
It wasn't our anniversary.

133
00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:13.784
I finished my period.

134
00:11:16.355 --> 00:11:17.965
Hey, Yang Ho Rang.

135
00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:19.995
What?

136
00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:23.365
Why didn't you tell me earlier? You little...

137
00:11:24.564 --> 00:11:27.204
- Come here. - I'm so happy. Gosh.

138
00:11:27.304 --> 00:11:28.904
- You're not going to work. - I'd love that.

139
00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.204
Hold on.

140
00:11:34.204 --> 00:11:36.245
- What? - Gosh.

141
00:11:36.544 --> 00:11:37.615
Gosh.

142
00:11:45.824 --> 00:11:47.454
- Yes, Ji Ho. - Hey.

143
00:11:47.454 --> 00:11:49.054
We're in big trouble.

144
00:11:49.054 --> 00:11:51.495
Why is his housemate a woman?

145
00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:53.625
What? What are you talking about?

146
00:11:53.625 --> 00:11:56.034
What? Why is the landlord a man?

147
00:12:03.105 --> 00:12:04.135
(Yoon Ji Ho)

148
00:12:08.044 --> 00:12:09.345
(Yoon Ji Ho)

149
00:12:13.784 --> 00:12:15.554
You said his name is Ji Ho and that he's handsome.

150
00:12:15.554 --> 00:12:16.615
You told me he quit smoking.

151
00:12:16.615 --> 00:12:18.524
Yes, Ji Ho. She's handsome.

152
00:12:18.654 --> 00:12:20.085
She really quit smoking.

153
00:12:20.255 --> 00:12:21.824
Are you joking with me?

154
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.524
Aren't you the one joking with me?

155
00:12:23.524 --> 00:12:24.625
You said her name is Se Hee.

156
00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:26.995
A quiet person with a cat that was born in 1980.

157
00:12:28.034 --> 00:12:29.965
You told me she's the one standing next to you.

158
00:12:29.965 --> 00:12:32.904
Yes, he's super quiet and he has a cat.

159
00:12:32.904 --> 00:12:35.605
He's standing right next to me. That's Se Hee.

160
00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:37.434
That's Se Hee without a doubt.

161
00:12:37.434 --> 00:12:38.444
Hey.

162
00:12:39.774 --> 00:12:43.574
No one would expect a quiet man to have a cat.

163
00:12:44.745 --> 00:12:48.385
Fine. Then who would expect a handsome woman to quit smoking?

164
00:12:52.225 --> 00:12:53.554
We're in big trouble.

165
00:13:00.765 --> 00:13:01.794
Gosh.

166
00:13:03.664 --> 00:13:04.804
We're ruined.

167
00:13:05.804 --> 00:13:06.804
Yes.

168
00:13:08.135 --> 00:13:09.204
Okay.

169
00:13:10.074 --> 00:13:11.174
Okay.

170
00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:15.115
(Nam Se Hee)

171
00:13:16.914 --> 00:13:18.544
(Yoon Ji Ho)

172
00:13:25.225 --> 00:13:26.225
Here.

173
00:13:32.865 --> 00:13:35.635
says they'll take care of it. They're sorry.

174
00:13:35.735 --> 00:13:37.794
How can they take care of it?

175
00:13:37.904 --> 00:13:39.235
It's us that's in the situation.

176
00:13:39.765 --> 00:13:40.765
You're right.

177
00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:44.845
When I heard your name, I thought you were a woman.

178
00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:47.404
I know a man with the same name as you.

179
00:13:47.645 --> 00:13:48.845
He was in my military troop.

180
00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:50.745
I see...

181
00:14:04.765 --> 00:14:07.495
I have work to do, so I better go out.

182
00:14:07.625 --> 00:14:08.635
Okay.

183
00:14:10.465 --> 00:14:12.534
Please contact me once you have things figured out.

184
00:14:13.635 --> 00:14:14.735
Okay, I will.

185
00:14:40.924 --> 00:14:41.995
Yes.

186
00:14:43.135 --> 00:14:44.605
You're right.

187
00:14:45.204 --> 00:14:46.664
I better eat first.

188
00:14:50.304 --> 00:14:53.105
I need to end this life.

189
00:15:04.924 --> 00:15:06.085
- Ji Ho. - Yes?

190
00:15:06.085 --> 00:15:07.485
Do you want a steak too?

191
00:15:07.485 --> 00:15:08.924
Hold on. I'll put in an order...

192
00:15:09.194 --> 00:15:10.995
It's okay, this is enough.

193
00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:13.995
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:14.865 --> 00:15:16.495
How does this even make sense?

195
00:15:16.495 --> 00:15:18.164
Bong Hee and Ok Hee are girl names.

196
00:15:18.164 --> 00:15:19.904
How is Se Hee a man's name? It's too pretty for a man.

197
00:15:19.904 --> 00:15:22.174
Hey, not all pretty names belong to women.

198
00:15:22.304 --> 00:15:24.005
That's true. Even your name is Soo Ji.

199
00:15:27.044 --> 00:15:28.615
Do you want water? Hold on.

200
00:15:29.475 --> 00:15:31.314
That little wench.

201
00:15:31.914 --> 00:15:33.284
Are you okay?

202
00:15:41.954 --> 00:15:43.024
Soo Ji.

203
00:15:44.454 --> 00:15:47.865
You know, the house owner.

204
00:15:52.505 --> 00:15:55.204
I think he's...

205
00:15:56.235 --> 00:15:57.534
- I... - Why?

206
00:15:57.704 --> 00:16:00.005
Did he hit on you?

207
00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:02.174
He hit on you?

208
00:16:02.245 --> 00:16:03.274
Is he good looking?

209
00:16:03.274 --> 00:16:04.345
How much does he earn?

210
00:16:10.314 --> 00:16:11.355
Never mind.

211
00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:18.424
Hey, your chief lives in Namcheon-dong, doesn't he?

212
00:16:19.794 --> 00:16:22.664
I did all the work with your chief, you know.

213
00:16:33.845 --> 00:16:35.145
Jjajangmyeon is so good.

214
00:16:43.615 --> 00:16:45.085
Darn it. What do you want me to do?

215
00:16:45.324 --> 00:16:47.225
I was stood up by the girl I like,

216
00:16:47.225 --> 00:16:50.125
and I'm having jjajangmyeon in the office on the weekend.

217
00:16:50.125 --> 00:16:53.164
What do you want me to do more? What do you want?

218
00:16:53.194 --> 00:16:55.595
Hit me then. Hit me if it helps you feel better.

219
00:16:55.595 --> 00:16:58.605
Here. Wait, that won't do.

220
00:16:58.804 --> 00:17:00.904
Stab my artery with this.

221
00:17:01.034 --> 00:17:02.274
Try stabbing me!

222
00:17:07.275 --> 00:17:09.775
I mean, it's hard to believe...

223
00:17:09.944 --> 00:17:12.385
someone so thorough didn't make sure of everything at first.

224
00:17:12.385 --> 00:17:13.984
You are so thorough.

225
00:17:13.984 --> 00:17:17.115
Is that something that the CEO should be saying?

226
00:17:18.825 --> 00:17:20.025
(Love is science. A world that anyone can love someone.)

227
00:17:20.025 --> 00:17:22.855
(Date someone through data, not phone calls or texting.)

228
00:17:24.494 --> 00:17:26.264
All the data was perfect.

229
00:17:26.325 --> 00:17:28.764
I checked the face through Facebook. Most importantly,

230
00:17:29.234 --> 00:17:32.805
the contract articles included recycling and looking after my cat.

231
00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:34.434
They were perfect.

232
00:17:35.174 --> 00:17:38.174
Well, but initially, you didn't know it was a woman.

233
00:17:38.444 --> 00:17:40.605
Is she pretty? Is she cute?

234
00:17:41.275 --> 00:17:42.744
Why aren't you answering?

235
00:17:43.474 --> 00:17:44.585
She's cute.

236
00:17:45.115 --> 00:17:47.744
I'm going to sleep over at my friend's tonight.

237
00:17:48.454 --> 00:17:51.525
- She's cute, isn't she? - So stay comfortably for tonight.

238
00:17:51.525 --> 00:17:53.555
She must be pretty.

239
00:18:01.464 --> 00:18:03.895
Did the director give you a call yet?

240
00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.904
I know. Has he gone somewhere?

241
00:18:07.904 --> 00:18:10.174
Do you think you can trust that director?

242
00:18:10.434 --> 00:18:13.474
He always uses you, telling you that he's going to use your scenario.

243
00:18:15.744 --> 00:18:16.815
Hello?

244
00:18:18.145 --> 00:18:19.514
Yes, sir.

245
00:18:23.484 --> 00:18:26.525
All right. I'll fix it when I reach the office.

246
00:18:27.325 --> 00:18:28.994
All right. See you tomorrow.

247
00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:32.264
That jerk.

248
00:18:34.424 --> 00:18:35.535
Is it work?

249
00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:37.295
Do you have to go back?

250
00:18:37.395 --> 00:18:38.605
I guess.

251
00:18:39.335 --> 00:18:42.275
I can actually do it tomorrow, but I wouldn't feel at ease.

252
00:18:46.244 --> 00:18:47.404
I know.

253
00:18:48.645 --> 00:18:50.514
If it's something you have to do,

254
00:18:51.615 --> 00:18:53.585
it's better to finish it today.

255
00:18:53.845 --> 00:18:55.085
You're right.

256
00:18:55.414 --> 00:18:57.514
It's something I have to do.

257
00:18:57.785 --> 00:18:59.454
Nobody will do it for me anyway.

258
00:19:00.154 --> 00:19:02.355
Ji Ho, go home first.

259
00:19:02.754 --> 00:19:04.454
Soo Ji, let me off here.

260
00:19:04.865 --> 00:19:06.464
The bus stop over there.

261
00:19:13.404 --> 00:19:14.535
Thanks.

262
00:19:15.974 --> 00:19:17.535
Call me if something happens.

263
00:19:17.805 --> 00:19:19.944
If he tries to make a move, get rid of him.

264
00:19:31.115 --> 00:19:32.785
I was the one who tried to make a move.

265
00:19:35.494 --> 00:19:37.525
That won't be undone anyway.

266
00:19:39.895 --> 00:19:41.125
Let's go.

267
00:20:08.525 --> 00:20:09.625
I...

268
00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:14.025
would like to make an apology.

269
00:20:15.295 --> 00:20:16.434
That's why I came tonight.

270
00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:19.964
When I...

271
00:20:20.904 --> 00:20:22.674
kissed you...

272
00:20:25.775 --> 00:20:27.204
at the bus stop...

273
00:20:30.244 --> 00:20:31.984
I'm really...

274
00:20:33.615 --> 00:20:34.754
sorry...

275
00:20:35.555 --> 00:20:37.615
that I did that.

276
00:20:42.494 --> 00:20:43.694
That's an offside.

277
00:20:44.454 --> 00:20:46.694
- Pardon? - It wasn't a regular attack.

278
00:20:46.694 --> 00:20:50.494
It was like an offside when you attacked me when I was defenseless.

279
00:20:50.734 --> 00:20:54.234
Yes, you're right. It was like an offside.

280
00:20:55.474 --> 00:20:56.775
I'm really sorry.

281
00:20:57.474 --> 00:20:58.605
Okay.

282
00:20:58.845 --> 00:21:01.275
Were you super upset?

283
00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:03.115
- I would've been as well... - Being upset...

284
00:21:03.174 --> 00:21:05.184
involves some emotions.

285
00:21:05.214 --> 00:21:07.615
When people are unexpectedly attacked,

286
00:21:07.615 --> 00:21:09.714
they feel perplexed and unpleasant.

287
00:21:10.914 --> 00:21:12.724
Attacked? Did you say I attacked you?

288
00:21:13.224 --> 00:21:15.754
No, it wasn't like that. I was just...

289
00:21:15.754 --> 00:21:18.625
I just was so in the mood that night,

290
00:21:18.825 --> 00:21:22.035
but it doesn't mean I wanted to harass you or anything.

291
00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:24.934
It was never meant to be an attack.

292
00:21:24.934 --> 00:21:26.404
It's true. Believe me.

293
00:21:33.174 --> 00:21:36.244
I know that it's only right...

294
00:21:36.815 --> 00:21:38.285
for me to get out of here right now,

295
00:21:38.944 --> 00:21:40.085
but...

296
00:21:41.254 --> 00:21:43.785
I have nowhere to go right now.

297
00:21:44.414 --> 00:21:47.525
I have some work I'm waiting to receive, and once I get that,

298
00:21:47.585 --> 00:21:49.555
I'll move out right away.

299
00:21:51.664 --> 00:21:52.964
I'm really sorry.

300
00:22:09.944 --> 00:22:11.714
(Turtle Studying Room)

301
00:22:13.285 --> 00:22:15.484
Sir, how are you spending your rest days?

302
00:22:16.154 --> 00:22:18.125
I fixed the scenario that you said you like...

303
00:22:18.285 --> 00:22:19.954
one more time.

304
00:22:20.385 --> 00:22:21.994
Don't feel pressured,

305
00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:27.295
and get back to me soon.

306
00:22:27.295 --> 00:22:30.434
(The mail has been sent.)

307
00:22:43.244 --> 00:22:45.914
Did he just lock the door?

308
00:22:47.484 --> 00:22:48.484
Unbelievable.

309
00:22:51.254 --> 00:22:55.025
(Director Park)

310
00:23:01.095 --> 00:23:02.295
Hello?

311
00:23:03.434 --> 00:23:04.434
Yes.

312
00:23:08.404 --> 00:23:11.004
No, I wasn't sleeping.

313
00:23:40.365 --> 00:23:41.775
Drama for Fridays and Saturdays?

314
00:23:41.775 --> 00:23:45.504
Yes. The upper management wanted a fresh and youth melodrama...

315
00:23:45.904 --> 00:23:47.444
to be aired.

316
00:23:47.674 --> 00:23:50.575
I mean, there's no reason not to do it...

317
00:23:50.575 --> 00:23:52.085
when you've written so much.

318
00:23:53.184 --> 00:23:56.315
I'm... I'm just really grateful.

319
00:23:57.355 --> 00:23:58.625
- Hey. - Yes?

320
00:23:59.025 --> 00:24:00.684
You know it's my first drama I'm directing.

321
00:24:01.525 --> 00:24:03.994
I hope you two work together...

322
00:24:04.454 --> 00:24:07.025
and make me a masterpiece.

323
00:24:17.575 --> 00:24:19.575
I think there must be more back stories and secrets...

324
00:24:19.845 --> 00:24:21.815
for the characters.

325
00:24:24.585 --> 00:24:26.714
- Okay. - And among the supporting roles,

326
00:24:26.785 --> 00:24:28.684
there's one who plays a student who wants to be a writer.

327
00:24:29.714 --> 00:24:31.254
- What about it? - I mean...

328
00:24:31.825 --> 00:24:35.025
It's not realistic for someone who graduated from...

329
00:24:35.454 --> 00:24:37.154
Seoul National University to want to become a scenario writer.

330
00:24:39.464 --> 00:24:40.994
Is it unrealistic?

331
00:24:40.994 --> 00:24:43.764
Well, I know for a fact that some directors take multiple exams...

332
00:24:43.764 --> 00:24:44.865
to become directors.

333
00:24:45.664 --> 00:24:47.065
That's a different story.

334
00:24:47.135 --> 00:24:50.234
That's different because it's studying to get employed.

335
00:24:51.345 --> 00:24:53.045
For writers...

336
00:24:53.645 --> 00:24:55.914
They never know when they'll become a writer.

337
00:24:55.914 --> 00:24:57.174
It's like walking in a dark tunnel.

338
00:24:57.444 --> 00:25:00.845
Why would someone with such a prominent future do that?

339
00:25:21.734 --> 00:25:24.075
(Yoon Ji Ho, Seoul National University)

340
00:25:24.744 --> 00:25:27.145
Let's make history with our first paid work.

341
00:25:27.145 --> 00:25:29.275
Don't you want to become a star writer?

342
00:25:38.254 --> 00:25:41.295
Right, this could be my last chance.

343
00:25:42.224 --> 00:25:44.055
I can make this happen.

344
00:25:44.795 --> 00:25:46.264
I will become the legend.

345
00:26:57.264 --> 00:26:59.964
Your loan payment is due on September 29.

346
00:26:59.964 --> 00:27:02.204
The interest rate will be 3.2%.

347
00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:06.375
The total amount of your loan is 187,260 dollars,

348
00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:08.775
and your installment is 865 dollars.

349
00:27:08.845 --> 00:27:09.875
Neohee Bank.

350
00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:26.395
(Income)

351
00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:28.135
(Expense)

352
00:27:38.805 --> 00:27:40.244
(The loan installment, insurance, food)

353
00:27:40.244 --> 00:27:42.414
(Wage and rent from the tenant)

354
00:27:44.585 --> 00:27:46.145
(Cat food and family event)

355
00:27:47.785 --> 00:27:50.454
(Wage and rent from the tenant)

356
00:27:50.855 --> 00:27:52.154
If that's the case...

357
00:27:52.525 --> 00:27:57.555
(Income minus expenses is negative 300 dollars.)

358
00:27:59.194 --> 00:28:00.525
(No health insurance expense)

359
00:28:00.525 --> 00:28:02.164
(No leisure expense)

360
00:28:02.164 --> 00:28:03.595
(Changing the food expense to...)

361
00:28:04.704 --> 00:28:06.704
(45 dollars)

362
00:28:06.704 --> 00:28:11.035
(No change for the cat food)

363
00:28:17.885 --> 00:28:18.944
What are you doing?

364
00:28:21.315 --> 00:28:23.154
I'm trying to adjust my cost of living for next month.

365
00:28:29.395 --> 00:28:32.365
Wow, how can someone like you...

366
00:28:32.365 --> 00:28:33.964
get a tenant in your place?

367
00:28:34.095 --> 00:28:35.934
I can never think of you as...

368
00:28:36.065 --> 00:28:39.404
someone who can live with another human being.

369
00:28:39.704 --> 00:28:41.275
I need the money.

370
00:28:41.674 --> 00:28:44.375
If I get paid the rent for 10 years, that becomes 36,000 dollars

371
00:28:44.404 --> 00:28:46.045
If my monthly wage and the rent are guaranteed,

372
00:28:46.045 --> 00:28:48.674
I can pay my loan back in 12 years.

373
00:28:48.974 --> 00:28:50.014
So?

374
00:28:50.014 --> 00:28:52.914
If I retire at 50, it means I have 12 years to work from now on.

375
00:28:52.914 --> 00:28:55.014
The average life expectancy of Koreans is 81.2.

376
00:28:55.014 --> 00:28:57.014
I will be able to spend 32 years in my house...

377
00:28:57.014 --> 00:28:59.154
after my retirement.

378
00:28:59.254 --> 00:29:02.895
I mean, I wouldn't be home that much while I'm working and making money.

379
00:29:02.994 --> 00:29:04.355
Therefore, it's better to find a tenant...

380
00:29:04.355 --> 00:29:06.264
and pay back my loan with the rent as soon as possible.

381
00:29:06.264 --> 00:29:07.795
That's my goal.

382
00:29:09.164 --> 00:29:11.404
Okay. I see what you want to do.

383
00:29:11.535 --> 00:29:14.305
But you are not getting any rent next month.

384
00:29:15.605 --> 00:29:17.204
Why do you think that happened?

385
00:30:43.194 --> 00:30:44.895
(Diligence, Recycle, Maturity, Cleanness, Cat)

386
00:30:44.895 --> 00:30:46.565
(Tenant 1, Han Ji Sang, the personality clash.)

387
00:30:46.565 --> 00:30:48.194
(Tenant 2, Sim Jun Ho, smoker, brought a woman.)

388
00:30:48.194 --> 00:30:49.865
(Diligence, Recycle, Maturity, Cleanness, Cat)

389
00:30:50.035 --> 00:30:51.335
(The reason for disqualification is his negligence in duty.)

390
00:30:51.335 --> 00:30:52.635
(Possible alcoholic)

391
00:30:52.635 --> 00:30:53.635
(Chelsea fan)

392
00:30:53.635 --> 00:30:54.674
(He yelled at the cat.)

393
00:30:59.305 --> 00:31:01.414
(Tenant 7, Yoon Ji Ho)

394
00:31:05.714 --> 00:31:08.855
4.7? Is this even possible?

395
00:31:09.115 --> 00:31:12.385
I think you should live with her.

396
00:31:12.385 --> 00:31:15.295
Getting this high score from a crazy person like you...

397
00:31:15.325 --> 00:31:16.895
is more difficult than getting the perfect SAT score.

398
00:31:16.895 --> 00:31:18.095
But I can't live with her.

399
00:31:18.164 --> 00:31:20.724
Why not? There are many men and women housemates these days.

400
00:31:20.724 --> 00:31:23.095
You are not even interested in dating anyone.

401
00:31:23.095 --> 00:31:25.335
I can't do that. It's too much of a risk.

402
00:31:25.335 --> 00:31:26.335
What kind of risk?

403
00:31:27.464 --> 00:31:28.504
What could there be?

404
00:31:29.704 --> 00:31:31.775
(The reason for disqualification is...)

405
00:31:43.454 --> 00:31:46.454
(she's a woman.)

406
00:32:12.585 --> 00:32:14.414
- What is this? - I'll do that.

407
00:32:14.754 --> 00:32:16.514
- Look. - So I was like...

408
00:32:17.714 --> 00:32:20.125
Are you going to work already?

409
00:32:20.625 --> 00:32:21.654
Yes, I am.

410
00:32:23.224 --> 00:32:25.125
You don't have to recycle anymore.

411
00:32:26.264 --> 00:32:29.835
But it's my task for the time being.

412
00:32:30.434 --> 00:32:32.934
This is what I need to do until I move out.

413
00:32:33.635 --> 00:32:34.635
I see.

414
00:32:37.605 --> 00:32:38.605
Yes.

415
00:32:39.504 --> 00:32:40.575
Bye then.

416
00:32:49.585 --> 00:32:50.585
Excuse me.

417
00:32:51.085 --> 00:32:52.085
Yes?

418
00:32:52.154 --> 00:32:55.855
Did you fix the tiles in the bathroom?

419
00:32:55.994 --> 00:32:58.565
Yes, I did. They seemed quite old.

420
00:32:58.565 --> 00:33:00.025
So I did it last weekend.

421
00:33:03.095 --> 00:33:05.464
Should I have had your permission for that?

422
00:33:05.464 --> 00:33:06.764
No, that's not what it is.

423
00:33:08.174 --> 00:33:11.275
Did you clean the windows in the living room too?

424
00:33:11.345 --> 00:33:14.545
Yes, I did. That's what I do before I write...

425
00:33:15.345 --> 00:33:16.414
I see.

426
00:33:18.645 --> 00:33:23.754
By the way... Why did you kiss me?

427
00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:27.525
Is he crazy?

428
00:33:29.125 --> 00:33:31.395
My sister said she would come home.

429
00:33:31.395 --> 00:33:32.565
Hey.

430
00:33:32.565 --> 00:33:33.994
- It's nice to see you. - Hi.

431
00:33:33.994 --> 00:33:35.035
Why are you...

432
00:33:36.135 --> 00:33:37.734
asking me that?

433
00:33:37.904 --> 00:33:40.035
It's very important to me.

434
00:33:40.035 --> 00:33:41.575
I mean, to live with you.

435
00:33:42.934 --> 00:33:45.775
That still doesn't make any sense.

436
00:33:46.845 --> 00:33:49.145
I don't think that's what we can talk about right now.

437
00:33:49.145 --> 00:33:51.285
- You should do it well. - That doesn't work like that.

438
00:33:51.285 --> 00:33:52.885
- It's here. - Look at this.

439
00:33:52.885 --> 00:33:54.345
Did you dry all the peppers?

440
00:33:54.345 --> 00:33:55.484
I didn't. I just ground it.

441
00:33:55.484 --> 00:33:57.514
- Okay. - That's enough for this year!

442
00:33:57.514 --> 00:33:58.684
I see.

443
00:33:58.684 --> 00:33:59.984
- Doesn't it have a nice color? - Yes, it does.

444
00:33:59.984 --> 00:34:01.355
The peppers looked really fine.

445
00:34:08.095 --> 00:34:10.235
- See you later. - Bye.

446
00:34:10.235 --> 00:34:12.664
You can talk about it now.

447
00:34:15.875 --> 00:34:16.934
Well...

448
00:34:18.675 --> 00:34:19.974
To be honest,

449
00:34:20.645 --> 00:34:22.474
I just wanted to do that.

450
00:34:22.574 --> 00:34:24.545
You just wanted to do that.

451
00:34:25.815 --> 00:34:26.844
Yes.

452
00:34:28.485 --> 00:34:29.614
It's because...

453
00:34:31.925 --> 00:34:34.525
I haven't been in a relationship.

454
00:34:35.094 --> 00:34:37.554
So I hadn't kissed anyone.

455
00:34:38.364 --> 00:34:40.965
And things didn't go well with the guy I liked.

456
00:34:41.264 --> 00:34:42.465
Yes, I know that.

457
00:34:43.395 --> 00:34:45.405
That was going to happen anyway.

458
00:34:45.565 --> 00:34:48.204
You can date someone when you have money and time.

459
00:34:48.634 --> 00:34:50.204
I have neither.

460
00:34:50.934 --> 00:34:53.175
Normally, you have to date someone to kiss.

461
00:34:54.474 --> 00:34:57.215
But I thought that wouldn't really happen in my life.

462
00:34:57.215 --> 00:35:01.145
That's what I was thinking, and all of a sudden...

463
00:35:01.914 --> 00:35:03.114
I was like, "Why not?"

464
00:35:03.114 --> 00:35:06.324
Because I thought I wouldn't have a chance to kiss someone.

465
00:35:06.324 --> 00:35:08.655
That's basically why I did that.

466
00:35:12.525 --> 00:35:13.664
I think that's what it is.

467
00:35:17.695 --> 00:35:20.505
I feel like I'm crazy after saying that.

468
00:35:21.405 --> 00:35:22.675
You don't understand, do you?

469
00:35:22.905 --> 00:35:25.905
I do, I fully understand you if that's the case.

470
00:35:26.744 --> 00:35:28.545
Really?

471
00:35:28.545 --> 00:35:30.775
Yes, relationships cost you something...

472
00:35:30.775 --> 00:35:32.784
whether it's money, time, or emotions.

473
00:35:32.884 --> 00:35:36.255
You wanted to bring out a result without any cost.

474
00:35:36.255 --> 00:35:38.954
That's why you kissed me.

475
00:35:39.025 --> 00:35:40.485
That's right.

476
00:35:40.784 --> 00:35:42.054
That's exactly what I'm saying.

477
00:35:42.454 --> 00:35:45.425
You're not looking for any kind of love relationship either.

478
00:35:45.494 --> 00:35:48.565
No, my hands are full of problems already. I shouldn't add to that.

479
00:35:48.565 --> 00:35:49.634
Then it's fine.

480
00:35:49.965 --> 00:35:51.804
- What? - It's perfect.

481
00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:54.804
What is?

482
00:35:56.775 --> 00:35:59.945
This is the list of my past housemates.

483
00:36:00.574 --> 00:36:03.045
As you can see,

484
00:36:03.244 --> 00:36:06.284
you have the highest score among these seven housemates.

485
00:36:07.954 --> 00:36:11.884
To be honest, I've never met someone who qualifies all my criteria.

486
00:36:12.054 --> 00:36:15.094
Thus, it's most likely that I won't ever meet someone like you again.

487
00:36:15.324 --> 00:36:16.454
But...

488
00:36:17.864 --> 00:36:20.625
I have a critical disqualification.

489
00:36:20.864 --> 00:36:24.065
I believe that's our blind spot, at the same time, advantage.

490
00:36:24.505 --> 00:36:26.735
- Pardon? - You'll be disqualified...

491
00:36:26.735 --> 00:36:28.804
if we have at least the slightest possibility of falling in love.

492
00:36:28.804 --> 00:36:30.775
But we know it's not going to happen.

493
00:36:31.775 --> 00:36:33.545
So it's safe for both of us.

494
00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:37.244
What's more, we have already kissed each other.

495
00:36:37.545 --> 00:36:40.244
It's been proved it's never going to happen.

496
00:36:42.485 --> 00:36:43.585
You have a point.

497
00:36:45.224 --> 00:36:46.585
You can trust me.

498
00:36:47.485 --> 00:36:50.594
I happened to kiss you somehow,

499
00:36:51.864 --> 00:36:54.065
but you're really not my type.

500
00:36:54.764 --> 00:36:55.965
The feeling is mutual.

501
00:36:58.965 --> 00:37:02.204
Then can I continue to be your housemate?

502
00:37:02.405 --> 00:37:03.434
Yes.

503
00:37:09.945 --> 00:37:11.445
You decided to live with him?

504
00:37:12.585 --> 00:37:14.755
Will you be all right? He's still a man.

505
00:37:15.485 --> 00:37:16.485
Sure.

506
00:37:16.884 --> 00:37:19.755
Nothing's going to happen between us anymore.

507
00:37:21.054 --> 00:37:22.125
What do you mean?

508
00:37:23.895 --> 00:37:24.965
Anymore?

509
00:37:25.795 --> 00:37:27.625
Well...

510
00:37:27.795 --> 00:37:31.264
I don't think I'll be able to find a better place...

511
00:37:31.605 --> 00:37:33.164
than this house anymore.

512
00:37:33.204 --> 00:37:34.735
The landlord...

513
00:37:35.875 --> 00:37:38.405
needs a tenant in order to pay for his loan.

514
00:37:38.545 --> 00:37:42.074
I need a place to rent without any deposit. It's a win-win.

515
00:37:42.744 --> 00:37:44.784
Then again, when will you ever get to live in such a place again?

516
00:37:45.645 --> 00:37:48.715
How much is the lease? Is it expensive?

517
00:37:57.025 --> 00:37:59.864
(Turtle Studying Room, written by Yoon Ji Ho)

518
00:38:04.065 --> 00:38:05.565
- Hello. - You're here.

519
00:38:05.605 --> 00:38:06.664
You're here early.

520
00:38:06.965 --> 00:38:08.175
Hi, Ji Ho.

521
00:38:10.175 --> 00:38:11.945
- Hello. - Are you surprised?

522
00:38:13.405 --> 00:38:15.145
I'm happy to see you guys again.

523
00:38:15.675 --> 00:38:17.645
- Now, please be seated. - Okay.

524
00:38:19.945 --> 00:38:23.684
So I think it might be better if Ms. Hwang give us some advice...

525
00:38:23.815 --> 00:38:27.585
regarding its storyline and everything.

526
00:38:27.855 --> 00:38:30.554
That'll help us getting a more prime air time.

527
00:38:30.655 --> 00:38:33.025
You know they aren't willing to give new writers prime air time.

528
00:38:35.335 --> 00:38:36.395
I see.

529
00:38:36.965 --> 00:38:39.204
Both of you will be the main scriptwriters. Don't be mistaken.

530
00:38:39.735 --> 00:38:40.764
Ms. Yoon.

531
00:38:42.405 --> 00:38:43.574
There's nothing to be mistaken.

532
00:38:44.704 --> 00:38:45.905
It's rather an honor for me.

533
00:38:47.405 --> 00:38:49.074
Thank you in advance.

534
00:38:49.145 --> 00:38:51.485
Right, I won't take away...

535
00:38:51.485 --> 00:38:53.985
an assistant writer's work at this age.

536
00:38:55.155 --> 00:38:57.755
I'll help you as much as I can. Let's do this.

537
00:38:58.855 --> 00:39:01.824
Great, then let's start going over...

538
00:39:01.994 --> 00:39:03.525
from the first episode.

539
00:39:03.525 --> 00:39:05.465
From which part should I begin?

540
00:39:06.094 --> 00:39:07.525
I have so much to talk about.

541
00:39:10.965 --> 00:39:12.164
Ji Ho.

542
00:39:12.804 --> 00:39:13.835
Yes?

543
00:39:30.554 --> 00:39:31.554
Excuse me.

544
00:39:35.425 --> 00:39:36.494
Excuse me.

545
00:39:40.724 --> 00:39:42.494
- You're home. - Hi.

546
00:39:43.864 --> 00:39:46.565
I guess your work isn't going well again.

547
00:39:46.565 --> 00:39:49.235
Well, I got stressed out,

548
00:39:49.574 --> 00:39:50.934
so I happened to do this habitually again.

549
00:39:51.605 --> 00:39:52.645
You really...

550
00:39:54.974 --> 00:39:57.244
have such an ideal habit.

551
00:39:59.284 --> 00:40:01.045
- Is that so? - Yes.

552
00:40:01.815 --> 00:40:03.784
- It's so great of you. - Thank...

553
00:40:04.414 --> 00:40:05.655
Thank you.

554
00:40:46.925 --> 00:40:48.534
You want to join me?

555
00:40:48.934 --> 00:40:50.895
No, I have to go back to work.

556
00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:02.514
- He kept possession of the ball. - A good ball delivered to Sanchez.

557
00:41:02.514 --> 00:41:04.145
- He takes a shot. - It's Iwobi.

558
00:41:04.744 --> 00:41:07.244
It goes straight into the hands of Lloris.

559
00:41:07.784 --> 00:41:12.255
Arsenal swiftly switched from defense to offense.

560
00:41:14.494 --> 00:41:17.155
Watching a derby match is thrilling indeed.

561
00:41:17.224 --> 00:41:18.895
It's the best part of the league.

562
00:41:19.764 --> 00:41:22.134
Why won't he get married by the way?

563
00:41:22.134 --> 00:41:24.735
I mean, he owns a house and has a fine job.

564
00:41:25.235 --> 00:41:27.204
So why? Wait, by any chance...

565
00:41:27.905 --> 00:41:29.034
Is he gay?

566
00:41:30.735 --> 00:41:31.945
By the way,

567
00:41:32.605 --> 00:41:34.875
aren't you getting married?

568
00:41:36.974 --> 00:41:40.184
Well, people usually get married when they turn around your age.

569
00:41:40.645 --> 00:41:42.054
You own a house too.

570
00:41:42.085 --> 00:41:43.355
That's the usual case.

571
00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:45.985
But I'm single.

572
00:41:47.054 --> 00:41:49.755
Does that mean...

573
00:41:49.994 --> 00:41:52.125
- you won't get married forever? - Yes.

574
00:41:52.864 --> 00:41:55.664
This house, Kitty, and myself.

575
00:41:56.034 --> 00:41:58.634
I'm willing to bear these three things only.

576
00:41:59.134 --> 00:42:02.405
I don't need to bear something that requires more energy and cost.

577
00:42:04.434 --> 00:42:05.505
I see.

578
00:42:06.545 --> 00:42:07.645
So...

579
00:42:08.045 --> 00:42:10.514
how much more time do you have left to pay off your loan?

580
00:42:10.514 --> 00:42:12.145
I just need to pay for 30 more years.

581
00:42:12.514 --> 00:42:13.784
What?

582
00:42:18.025 --> 00:42:21.954
Then you'll have to work all your life only for this house.

583
00:42:23.155 --> 00:42:26.195
Isn't that too much in vain?

584
00:42:27.664 --> 00:42:31.204
There's nothing more certain than property in this country.

585
00:42:32.364 --> 00:42:34.364
You know better than anyone else.

586
00:42:45.384 --> 00:42:49.255
I saw earlier, and there's a general hospital right in front of here.

587
00:42:49.315 --> 00:42:51.224
Yes, it takes 10 minutes by foot.

588
00:42:51.224 --> 00:42:53.655
It's one of the reasons why I chose this house.

589
00:42:54.184 --> 00:42:55.855
- Are you sick? - No.

590
00:42:55.855 --> 00:42:58.525
It's advantageous this way in many parts...

591
00:42:58.525 --> 00:43:01.065
if I take my later years into consideration.

592
00:43:02.235 --> 00:43:05.735
You're still young, so isn't it too early to prepare for that?

593
00:43:05.905 --> 00:43:08.134
I'm going to die in this house.

594
00:43:08.134 --> 00:43:09.974
So I should take everything into consideration.

595
00:43:12.704 --> 00:43:15.775
Actually, your room will be where my death will take place.

596
00:43:23.514 --> 00:43:25.585
That room has nice ventilation.

597
00:43:34.125 --> 00:43:35.695
No wonder...

598
00:43:36.895 --> 00:43:38.335
why my room felt so cool and nice.

599
00:43:39.364 --> 00:43:41.775
I can tell all his thoughts are reasonable,

600
00:43:42.175 --> 00:43:44.275
but he does seem weird.

601
00:43:45.304 --> 00:43:46.545
He lacks emotions too.

602
00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:49.675
He's really not my type.

603
00:43:57.554 --> 00:43:58.684
Please wait for me.

604
00:44:00.125 --> 00:44:01.395
Thank you.

605
00:44:02.025 --> 00:44:04.155
The doors are closing.

606
00:44:07.525 --> 00:44:08.864
Which floor are you going?

607
00:44:09.735 --> 00:44:12.164
I'm going to the fourth floor too. Thank you for asking.

608
00:44:13.534 --> 00:44:14.875
The doors are opening.

609
00:44:21.775 --> 00:44:24.344
Miss, why are you going in there?

610
00:44:24.414 --> 00:44:25.514
Pardon?

611
00:44:26.145 --> 00:44:29.414
That's because this place is my house.

612
00:44:31.284 --> 00:44:33.585
This is my son's house.

613
00:44:34.085 --> 00:44:35.224
What?

614
00:44:52.204 --> 00:44:53.304
I'm fine.

615
00:44:54.974 --> 00:44:56.074
So...

616
00:44:56.875 --> 00:44:59.715
she's not your girlfriend?

617
00:44:59.815 --> 00:45:02.085
I told you. She's my housemate.

618
00:45:02.114 --> 00:45:05.485
Housemate, my foot. She's a woman.

619
00:45:05.655 --> 00:45:09.155
She's not your girlfriend, but you're living with her?

620
00:45:09.324 --> 00:45:11.594
I'm living with her because she's not my girlfriend.

621
00:45:11.824 --> 00:45:14.425
- She's a tenant. - You won't really get married?

622
00:45:14.895 --> 00:45:16.264
You want to see me die?

623
00:45:16.264 --> 00:45:18.664
Why would you bring that up again? I said I don't want to get married.

624
00:45:18.664 --> 00:45:22.175
Your father wants to get a divorce.

625
00:45:23.405 --> 00:45:26.704
He will divorce me if I don't make you get married.

626
00:45:26.945 --> 00:45:29.014
Do you want me to go through that at this age?

627
00:45:30.974 --> 00:45:33.545
Please understand me. I want to live happily.

628
00:45:33.585 --> 00:45:35.985
How can you be so selfish?

629
00:45:38.755 --> 00:45:39.855
I'm sorry.

630
00:45:40.085 --> 00:45:43.355
I didn't take the others visiting our house into consideration.

631
00:45:44.155 --> 00:45:47.264
She's not just anyone. She's your mother.

632
00:45:47.895 --> 00:45:50.664
All parents care about their children.

633
00:45:51.934 --> 00:45:55.005
What they want is to fulfill their desires...

634
00:45:55.204 --> 00:45:57.175
through their kids.

635
00:45:59.804 --> 00:46:03.114
If it's okay with you, you can just ignore her...

636
00:46:03.114 --> 00:46:05.315
No, how could I possibly do that?

637
00:46:05.514 --> 00:46:07.784
She left after taking two anxiety pills.

638
00:46:08.715 --> 00:46:12.324
A director I know told me there's one empty workshop I can stay at.

639
00:46:12.784 --> 00:46:14.724
I can stay there for a while.

640
00:46:15.494 --> 00:46:18.695
When I earn enough money, I'll get a room for myself.

641
00:46:18.695 --> 00:46:19.724
Okay.

642
00:46:20.494 --> 00:46:23.594
I'll transfer back this month's rent to your account.

643
00:46:24.505 --> 00:46:25.905
I'll get going to work then.

644
00:46:25.905 --> 00:46:27.304
All right.

645
00:46:45.355 --> 00:46:46.585
Kitty.

646
00:46:48.195 --> 00:46:50.295
I got attached to you already.

647
00:46:52.795 --> 00:46:55.795
I know you'll be bored after I'm gone.

648
00:47:10.215 --> 00:47:11.244
What's this?

649
00:47:11.844 --> 00:47:12.884
What?

650
00:47:14.244 --> 00:47:15.255
What?

651
00:47:20.324 --> 00:47:23.094
Sir, this isn't just a simple fix,

652
00:47:23.094 --> 00:47:24.525
but a whole different drama.

653
00:47:25.195 --> 00:47:28.264
What's wrong? You agreed to Writer Hwang fixing your script.

654
00:47:28.264 --> 00:47:29.835
But the whole story...

655
00:47:33.465 --> 00:47:37.505
How's this different from other foolish dramas?

656
00:47:37.844 --> 00:47:40.145
I mean, why add a birth secret story...

657
00:47:40.744 --> 00:47:42.614
to a story about youth?

658
00:47:42.815 --> 00:47:43.844
Ms. Yoon.

659
00:47:44.614 --> 00:47:46.244
Why are you acting like an amateur?

660
00:47:46.884 --> 00:47:47.914
Pardon?

661
00:47:47.914 --> 00:47:50.054
We all know the story about youth is fresh...

662
00:47:50.054 --> 00:47:51.724
and interesting.

663
00:47:51.724 --> 00:47:53.184
But would people watch it?

664
00:47:53.324 --> 00:47:55.795
People would only watch it...

665
00:47:56.025 --> 00:47:57.195
when it has conflicts.

666
00:48:02.164 --> 00:48:03.164
Ms. Yoon.

667
00:48:04.605 --> 00:48:05.934
I heard you graduated from Seoul National University.

668
00:48:07.164 --> 00:48:08.605
I heard it from Writer Hwang.

669
00:48:08.704 --> 00:48:12.005
Your classmates must be earning so much by now.

670
00:48:12.445 --> 00:48:13.844
You should be as well.

671
00:48:14.514 --> 00:48:17.014
You're already 30. How can you still be living somewhere like this?

672
00:48:18.545 --> 00:48:19.614
Don't you think so?

673
00:48:27.655 --> 00:48:29.695
She's a teacher in the school your father used to work at.

674
00:48:29.855 --> 00:48:32.395
She's just 28, so the age difference is perfect.

675
00:48:32.695 --> 00:48:34.735
Okay. I heard that already.

676
00:48:34.735 --> 00:48:35.934
Don't be late.

677
00:48:35.934 --> 00:48:39.264
Se Hee, try to be more attentive for my sake.

678
00:48:39.264 --> 00:48:41.034
Okay. Good night.

679
00:48:52.884 --> 00:48:54.784
I'm sorry I couldn't say this in person.

680
00:48:55.355 --> 00:48:56.655
Thank you for everything.

681
00:49:09.936 --> 00:49:12.606
(She take a man's underwear...)

682
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:23.862
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E02 Because This is My First Life
"Because This is My First Kiss"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

683
00:49:30.023 --> 00:49:31.594
The groom is entering.

684
00:49:40.934 --> 00:49:42.674
The bride is entering.

685
00:49:46.974 --> 00:49:48.014
Beautiful.

686
00:49:52.614 --> 00:49:53.983
There's nothing much to it.

687
00:49:53.983 --> 00:49:55.014
Just get married.

688
00:49:55.014 --> 00:49:56.253
There's nothing much to it.

689
00:49:56.353 --> 00:49:58.123
Just serve in the military again.

690
00:49:58.123 --> 00:49:59.253
What's the difference?

691
00:49:59.724 --> 00:50:01.724
It's different. Look over there.

692
00:50:01.853 --> 00:50:04.793
It'll be all over after doing this for an hour...

693
00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:07.494
and paying respect to the elders. That's all.

694
00:50:07.494 --> 00:50:09.634
So do they just go home after the wedding?

695
00:50:09.634 --> 00:50:11.233
That's possible.

696
00:50:11.233 --> 00:50:13.534
There are many type of couples.

697
00:50:13.534 --> 00:50:16.733
There are show-window couples, weekend couples and sexless couples.

698
00:50:16.804 --> 00:50:18.704
What's so hard about it?

699
00:50:18.704 --> 00:50:21.943
Your father promised to pay all the loans back when you get married.

700
00:50:22.713 --> 00:50:24.284
I would get married just for that.

701
00:50:25.443 --> 00:50:27.443
The groom and bride will now bow to each other.

702
00:50:29.114 --> 00:50:30.913
They're a perfect match!

703
00:50:37.094 --> 00:50:39.123
- Why isn't she here? - She said she'll be late.

704
00:50:39.123 --> 00:50:40.224
She has a meeting.

705
00:50:42.264 --> 00:50:45.663
Why are you here when it's a wedding of my college friend?

706
00:50:46.963 --> 00:50:48.704
She's also a college friend of Won Seok.

707
00:50:48.704 --> 00:50:50.474
I'm here in place of Won Seok because he's busy.

708
00:50:51.603 --> 00:50:52.603
Soo Ji.

709
00:50:52.773 --> 00:50:53.974
- Hey, Soo Ji. - Soo Ji.

710
00:50:53.974 --> 00:50:55.174
- Hi, Soo Ji. - Hi.

711
00:51:02.684 --> 00:51:03.684
Ji Ho.

712
00:51:06.853 --> 00:51:08.623
Congratulations, sir.

713
00:51:08.623 --> 00:51:10.193
- Thank you. - Well done, sir.

714
00:51:10.193 --> 00:51:11.563
- Thank you. - That was great.

715
00:51:12.563 --> 00:51:13.893
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

716
00:51:13.893 --> 00:51:15.063
Thank you.

717
00:51:15.063 --> 00:51:16.994
- Live happily. - Thanks.

718
00:51:19.063 --> 00:51:20.563
Your dress is so pretty.

719
00:51:20.804 --> 00:51:21.804
I got a new one.

720
00:51:22.003 --> 00:51:23.804
Soo Ji, can I have your business card?

721
00:51:23.804 --> 00:51:26.304
My brother's applying for the company you're in.

722
00:51:26.304 --> 00:51:27.474
I can't do much about it.

723
00:51:27.474 --> 00:51:30.014
Tell him to send me an email if he has any questions.

724
00:51:31.684 --> 00:51:34.353
I heard that you're the key figure in the business department.

725
00:51:35.284 --> 00:51:36.454
Give me your business card too.

726
00:51:36.583 --> 00:51:37.583
Give me one too.

727
00:51:37.583 --> 00:51:39.424
- Give me one. - You didn't get the full story.

728
00:51:39.583 --> 00:51:42.853
They call me the key figure just to make fun of me.

729
00:51:43.554 --> 00:51:45.063
No way.

730
00:51:45.424 --> 00:51:47.293
The real key figure is Ji Ho.

731
00:51:49.393 --> 00:51:51.704
She's the only one who got the full scholarship back in college.

732
00:51:51.963 --> 00:51:53.034
Isn't she the only one?

733
00:51:55.134 --> 00:51:56.733
Well, that's correct.

734
00:51:57.034 --> 00:51:58.974
Hey, Ji Ho. It's been a while.

735
00:52:00.704 --> 00:52:03.413
What do you do for living?

736
00:52:03.574 --> 00:52:06.443
Hey, she's a scenario writer for dramas.

737
00:52:06.514 --> 00:52:07.543
- Really? - Really?

738
00:52:07.543 --> 00:52:09.784
- That's awesome. - That's awesome.

739
00:52:10.114 --> 00:52:12.253
No, I'm just an assistant writer.

740
00:52:12.253 --> 00:52:13.784
That's amazing.

741
00:52:13.784 --> 00:52:15.293
What did you write?

742
00:52:16.054 --> 00:52:19.393
The most recent one was "Love Story of a Fool".

743
00:52:20.293 --> 00:52:21.663
A fool?

744
00:52:22.163 --> 00:52:23.663
A fool. I see.

745
00:52:24.094 --> 00:52:26.503
I also wrote "Ramyeon Restaurant of Kkotsoon".

746
00:52:30.503 --> 00:52:35.014
I bet you all know "The Queen of House Chores".

747
00:52:36.873 --> 00:52:39.014
Oh, of course.

748
00:52:39.384 --> 00:52:40.784
Oh, that one.

749
00:52:40.884 --> 00:52:41.983
You watched it, right?

750
00:52:41.983 --> 00:52:43.853
- Of course. - It was fun.

751
00:52:44.424 --> 00:52:47.184
You guys don't know "The Queen of House Chores"?

752
00:52:47.184 --> 00:52:49.054
I don't watch TV these days.

753
00:52:50.023 --> 00:52:53.364
That's the legendary morning drama.

754
00:52:53.364 --> 00:52:55.764
You guys, look them up on your phones right now.

755
00:52:55.764 --> 00:52:57.264
- Okay. - Hurry.

756
00:52:57.264 --> 00:52:58.603
- Okay. - I didn't know.

757
00:52:58.603 --> 00:52:59.663
- Okay. - Hey.

758
00:53:01.873 --> 00:53:04.443
I have to go because I have another appointment.

759
00:53:09.844 --> 00:53:10.983
Bye.

760
00:53:15.054 --> 00:53:18.023
Hey, why are you overreacting today?

761
00:53:18.583 --> 00:53:19.884
Calm down, will you?

762
00:53:32.764 --> 00:53:35.304
Why did you come out already? I really have to go because...

763
00:53:35.304 --> 00:53:36.773
I have to go home.

764
00:53:37.943 --> 00:53:39.443
Does the bus number 7737 pass here?

765
00:53:45.884 --> 00:53:48.813
Why do well-off people want to be humble too?

766
00:53:48.813 --> 00:53:51.123
That's such a turn-off, don't you think?

767
00:53:53.054 --> 00:53:55.994
I told you not to study too hard.

768
00:53:56.753 --> 00:53:59.463
Look at me. I don't even get to make decisions since I didn't study.

769
00:54:05.063 --> 00:54:07.134
Do you think there's a reason for things...

770
00:54:07.833 --> 00:54:09.404
that people tell you not do?

771
00:54:11.074 --> 00:54:14.514
My father told me that I'll starve to death if I chose my major.

772
00:54:16.674 --> 00:54:18.184
That's true.

773
00:54:20.384 --> 00:54:21.454
Ji Ho.

774
00:54:22.284 --> 00:54:24.014
Are you not on good terms with your writing?

775
00:54:26.083 --> 00:54:29.853
I mean, you don't earn as much as Soo Ji and date someone like me.

776
00:54:30.693 --> 00:54:33.623
But you always looked so happy when you were writing something.

777
00:54:36.094 --> 00:54:38.733
Don't you feel happy when you write these days?

778
00:54:46.373 --> 00:54:48.474
It's nice to meet you.

779
00:54:49.114 --> 00:54:50.913
It's nice to meet you.

780
00:54:51.784 --> 00:54:53.114
I'm going to go.

781
00:54:53.114 --> 00:54:54.784
Hey, have some loyalty. Wait for me.

782
00:54:54.983 --> 00:54:56.184
I hope to see you again.

783
00:54:58.253 --> 00:55:00.154
- Don't go. - I have an appointment.

784
00:55:00.154 --> 00:55:02.353
- I shouldn't be late. - It's the weekend. Don't lie.

785
00:55:03.654 --> 00:55:05.994
- Are you going on a blind date? - Bye.

786
00:55:06.563 --> 00:55:07.634
All right.

787
00:55:07.733 --> 00:55:11.063
Act like a normal person, and you'll be able to get married.

788
00:55:11.963 --> 00:55:13.764
Hello, it's nice to meet you. I'm Ma Sang Goo.

789
00:55:14.003 --> 00:55:15.404
I run a dating company.

790
00:55:19.304 --> 00:55:21.443
(Ji Ho)

791
00:55:30.114 --> 00:55:32.884
Let's see what I've got.

792
00:55:34.083 --> 00:55:37.154
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

793
00:55:37.793 --> 00:55:40.123
- I'm sorry. Are you okay? - Yes.

794
00:55:49.873 --> 00:55:50.943
This...

795
00:55:51.873 --> 00:55:53.773
I think I used it yesterday. Did I not?

796
00:55:54.643 --> 00:55:55.643
Give that to me.

797
00:55:56.943 --> 00:55:58.384
- Give what? - That.

798
00:55:59.384 --> 00:56:00.483
That's mine.

799
00:56:02.583 --> 00:56:03.654
This condom?

800
00:56:22.634 --> 00:56:25.844
It was her. How could she not recognize me?

801
00:56:28.844 --> 00:56:31.114
This woman named Choi Yong Jae...

802
00:56:31.114 --> 00:56:33.583
becomes the owner of the residence after killing the original owner.

803
00:56:33.614 --> 00:56:35.583
And a rich writer named Choi Jun Seok...

804
00:56:35.583 --> 00:56:37.384
happens to move into the residence.

805
00:56:37.454 --> 00:56:39.753
He looks for his mother.

806
00:56:39.853 --> 00:56:42.954
It turns out that the two are half brothers.

807
00:56:43.353 --> 00:56:46.193
You always looked so happy when you were writing something.

808
00:56:46.994 --> 00:56:48.634
Don't you feel happy when you write these days?

809
00:56:48.693 --> 00:56:52.103
There are also women who have crush on different guys.

810
00:56:52.103 --> 00:56:54.304
- It's interesting. - It is.

811
00:56:55.003 --> 00:56:56.833
- Right? - What do you think, Ms. Yoon?

812
00:57:00.074 --> 00:57:01.143
What?

813
00:57:06.643 --> 00:57:07.784
Yes, it's...

814
00:57:10.353 --> 00:57:11.554
Is it interesting?

815
00:57:14.554 --> 00:57:15.654
What's interesting?

816
00:57:18.693 --> 00:57:20.824
This story is about people living in a student residence.

817
00:57:21.193 --> 00:57:23.134
Why should a rich guy live in hiding here?

818
00:57:23.364 --> 00:57:25.434
This story is about romance of the youth.

819
00:57:25.663 --> 00:57:27.634
So why should half brothers come out?

820
00:57:27.674 --> 00:57:30.333
- Ji Ho. - Think about it.

821
00:57:30.674 --> 00:57:33.744
We might as well just go with a trashy storyline then.

822
00:57:33.773 --> 00:57:35.373
Why should we fool the viewers?

823
00:57:36.014 --> 00:57:37.114
Ji Ho.

824
00:57:37.684 --> 00:57:39.114
Did you just say trashy?

825
00:57:39.784 --> 00:57:41.483
Isn't that too rude?

826
00:57:41.913 --> 00:57:43.483
I'm only trying to help you.

827
00:57:43.684 --> 00:57:45.884
Do you not want to get this drama going?

828
00:57:45.884 --> 00:57:47.853
I get to choose...

829
00:57:51.724 --> 00:57:53.724
whether to get this drama going or not.

830
00:57:55.693 --> 00:57:57.663
This is my piece.

831
00:58:52.253 --> 00:58:54.494
(Send a text to my blind date.)

832
00:58:57.224 --> 00:59:00.193
(Did you get home safely?)

833
00:59:04.063 --> 00:59:05.603
If she got home safely,

834
00:59:06.764 --> 00:59:08.074
then what?

835
00:59:08.804 --> 00:59:10.634
It's such a waste of time.

836
00:59:30.924 --> 00:59:31.994
Sorry.

837
00:59:32.424 --> 00:59:34.163
I was so busy that I forgot to feed you.

838
00:59:37.963 --> 00:59:39.534
What we need...

839
00:59:40.434 --> 00:59:41.904
isn't marriage.

840
00:59:58.724 --> 01:00:00.454
Where are you, Ji Ho?

841
01:00:00.583 --> 01:00:02.193
Apologize to Ms. Hwang.

842
01:00:02.293 --> 01:00:04.154
We might really have to put a stop on our drama at this rate.

843
01:00:04.224 --> 01:00:05.924
You want to be done for in this field?

844
01:00:08.833 --> 01:00:09.893
Who's there?

845
01:00:15.583 --> 01:00:16.643
Who's there?

846
01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.954
What? You can't come in here.

847
01:00:25.195 --> 01:00:26.255
I...

848
01:00:27.054 --> 01:00:29.025
I can't even come here to see you?

849
01:00:30.295 --> 01:00:31.934
I got you this place after all.

850
01:00:38.675 --> 01:00:39.775
Ms. Yoon.

851
01:00:42.644 --> 01:00:44.815
What's wrong with you?

852
01:00:45.945 --> 01:00:49.585
I'm trying to make things work out with you.

853
01:00:51.485 --> 01:00:52.985
And why are you doing this to me?

854
01:00:54.155 --> 01:00:55.324
I...

855
01:00:56.525 --> 01:00:58.295
I tried to do the same.

856
01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:01.264
But this isn't the story we were going for.

857
01:01:03.195 --> 01:01:06.795
Not everyone can do what they want from the start.

858
01:01:07.135 --> 01:01:08.335
Only...

859
01:01:09.835 --> 01:01:11.605
the successful ones can do what they want.

860
01:01:13.034 --> 01:01:14.545
People like us...

861
01:01:14.545 --> 01:01:17.074
just have to do what we're told to do.

862
01:01:17.175 --> 01:01:19.074
Okay, I understand.

863
01:01:19.074 --> 01:01:21.085
So let's talk tomorrow when you're sober.

864
01:01:24.355 --> 01:01:25.414
Why are you doing this?

865
01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:28.255
Ms. Yoon.

866
01:01:29.755 --> 01:01:31.054
Have you never liked me?

867
01:01:33.025 --> 01:01:34.054
Don't do this.

868
01:01:34.425 --> 01:01:36.764
Stop it. Don't do this.

869
01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:38.735
Wait.

870
01:01:39.335 --> 01:01:41.434
You're drunk. Let's talk tomorrow.

871
01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:43.364
Don't do this. Hold on.

872
01:01:43.804 --> 01:01:45.534
I said, stop!

873
01:01:48.144 --> 01:01:49.204
Hey.

874
01:01:50.144 --> 01:01:51.175
You...

875
01:01:51.914 --> 01:01:53.875
You know why you're such a scum?

876
01:01:54.485 --> 01:01:56.885
It's not because you confused me for three years.

877
01:01:57.344 --> 01:01:59.585
It's not because you made a fool out of my piece.

878
01:02:00.114 --> 01:02:02.284
It's not because you flirted with me when you have a girlfriend.

879
01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:06.594
This is the only place...

880
01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:08.864
where I can sleep tonight.

881
01:02:09.594 --> 01:02:12.094
And you just made me leave this place too. You know that?

882
01:02:13.664 --> 01:02:17.264
I really want to sleep, you jerk!

883
01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:33.954
(Soo Ji)

884
01:02:46.835 --> 01:02:48.335
There's a side which you never wish to show others...

885
01:02:49.164 --> 01:02:51.434
no matter how close you are with them.

886
01:03:16.565 --> 01:03:19.894
I'm not going to let you sleep tonight.

887
01:03:23.005 --> 01:03:25.775
Sometimes, your family can be...

888
01:03:26.074 --> 01:03:28.804
the least close people to you.

889
01:03:35.215 --> 01:03:37.855
When I decided to follow my dream,

890
01:03:38.914 --> 01:03:40.485
I thought my life would be...

891
01:03:41.085 --> 01:03:45.324
like walking through a dark tunnel.

892
01:03:47.664 --> 01:03:49.324
But I didn't know it was going to be...

893
01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:52.394
this dark.

894
01:03:53.364 --> 01:03:54.835
I didn't know it was going to be...

895
01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:58.905
this lonely.

896
01:03:59.675 --> 01:04:00.804
How much...

897
01:04:03.074 --> 01:04:07.414
How much longer do I have to go?

898
01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:34.034
Why am I here now?

899
01:04:38.144 --> 01:04:39.215
Why?

900
01:04:40.775 --> 01:04:43.114
Why is my body doing this?

901
01:04:55.965 --> 01:04:59.094
Arsenal needs to make a breakthrough.

902
01:04:59.094 --> 01:05:02.235
It seems the last shot was deflected by the defender.

903
01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.505
Chelsea is still one goal ahead.

904
01:05:09.675 --> 01:05:11.914
Arsenal wins the ball back.

905
01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:14.244
- The ball gets delivered. - This looks promising.

906
01:05:14.445 --> 01:05:15.545
- Walcott. - Walcott!

907
01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:17.554
He takes a shot from inside the box. Sanchez!

908
01:05:17.554 --> 01:05:19.614
- Yes. - That was...

909
01:05:19.614 --> 01:05:20.815
I was asleep,

910
01:05:22.355 --> 01:05:25.155
then I woke up because of a dream.

911
01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:29.025
I was going to walk for a bit.

912
01:05:29.724 --> 01:05:32.965
Then I somehow got here.

913
01:05:33.235 --> 01:05:36.204
I see. I guess it was a bad dream.

914
01:05:37.704 --> 01:05:38.735
Yes, it was.

915
01:05:39.775 --> 01:05:42.204
It was an endless tunnel.

916
01:05:44.614 --> 01:05:47.045
I was walking through it by myself.

917
01:05:47.614 --> 01:05:48.744
I see.

918
01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.284
Welbeck is there.

919
01:05:50.284 --> 01:05:53.554
- They have to pass better. - That's right.

920
01:05:53.554 --> 01:05:55.155
How have you been?

921
01:05:55.724 --> 01:05:57.485
All right.

922
01:06:06.434 --> 01:06:07.434
I have...

923
01:06:08.804 --> 01:06:10.304
something to say.

924
01:06:10.565 --> 01:06:11.605
Okay.

925
01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:14.775
If you have some time...

926
01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:16.105
Yes?

927
01:06:16.644 --> 01:06:17.645
Would you...

928
01:06:18.314 --> 01:06:19.914
marry me?

929
01:06:26.185 --> 01:06:27.385
Back then...

930
01:06:28.324 --> 01:06:29.854
I just wanted to...

931
01:06:31.055 --> 01:06:32.625
literally fall into something...

932
01:06:34.425 --> 01:06:37.595
whether it's into a manhole or just a big hole.

933
01:06:39.034 --> 01:06:40.295
It didn't matter.

934
01:06:41.604 --> 01:06:42.635
Yes.

935
01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:47.675
I just want to...

936
01:06:48.805 --> 01:06:50.675
sleep well tonight.

937
01:07:14.965 --> 01:07:18.774
(Because This is My First Life)

938
01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:21.404
Do you like me by any chance?

939
01:07:22.074 --> 01:07:23.345
Ji Ho is...

940
01:07:23.345 --> 01:07:24.414
a bit...

941
01:07:25.244 --> 01:07:26.475
weird.

942
01:07:28.715 --> 01:07:30.645
Isn't that guy really cute?

943
01:07:30.645 --> 01:07:32.154
Many newly married couples buy it.

944
01:07:32.154 --> 01:07:34.685
Which is why not everyone is cut out for marriage.

945
01:07:34.824 --> 01:07:37.755
Stop being such a snob! It's really annoying!

946
01:07:38.694 --> 01:07:41.265
If my dad knocks over the table, it's the end of the discussion.

947
01:07:41.265 --> 01:07:42.895
Are you crazy?

948
01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.135
Did you say you want to live with a guy?

949
01:07:47.135 --> 01:07:48.965
I think this is fate.

950
01:07:48.965 --> 01:07:50.204
It was love at first sight, wasn't it?

951
01:07:50.204 --> 01:07:52.005
It felt unreal.

952
01:07:52.404 --> 01:07:55.274
By chance, do you like me?

953
01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:57.005
Because it's you, Ji Ho.

954
01:07:57.375 --> 01:07:59.045
That's why I did that.
