We're from Intellectual Crime Unit...

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.530
of Daemyeong Police Station.

5
00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:20.959
We received a report...

6
00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:22.799
about a break-in on the 20th floor.

7
00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.900
We were told to take care of this quietly.

8
00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.040
Please come in.

9
00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.839
I have to go to the bathroom. Excuse me.

10
00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:32.839
Sure.

11
00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:42.589
Mr. Choi.

12
00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:45.019
- To the chairman's room. - What?

13
00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.519
The police are here.

14
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.659
Hide in there for now, then leave quietly.

15
00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.059
Don't bump into them. Got it?

16
00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:59.570
Something is really weird.

17
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.219
Get those.

18
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.189
Mr. Choi.

19
00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:16.449
Get out.

20
00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:17.550
Mr. Choi.

21
00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:23.960
Get out of here!

22
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.729
Kim Min Joon, the police are coming.

23
00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.800
What?

24
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.430
This was a trap.

25
00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:31.339
- That way. - That way.

26
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.779
Mr. Choi!

27
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.050
- Kang Woo! - Mr. Choi.

28
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.150
What do you think you're doing?

29
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.850
Someone has to buy time.

30
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.919
This is like getting caught red-handed.

31
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.189
Let's go.

32
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.329
Darn you.

33
00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.699
Mr. Choi. Mr. Choi!

34
00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:01.430
- We have to go. - Mr. Choi.

35
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.669
- Mr. Choi. - Let's go.

36
00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:04.070
- Kang Woo. - Come with me.

37
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.469
No, Kang Woo!

38
00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:06.469
Kang Woo!

Where's the greenhouse?

41
00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:24.860
It's that way.

42
00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:57.749
Kang Woo.

43
00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.259
Mr. Choi?

44
00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.360
Gosh, you caught me.

45
00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.759
I'm sorry for breaking in without asking you.

46
00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.659
What about the people who were in here?

47
00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.430
Was someone else in here?

48
00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:10.029
Yes.

49
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.849
- Wait! Stop! - Ms. Jang!

50
00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.120
Wait! Stop right there!

51
00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.420
Wait.

52
00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:27.819
You there!

53
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.189
Where are you going?

54
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.520
Well...

55
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.960
We have to get some chemicals.

56
00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.730
We believe it's powdery mildew.

57
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.870
Ms. Jang, why did you come today?

58
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.670
I...

59
00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.309
The old files...

60
00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:52.339
Ha Ri.

61
00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:56.150
Did you bring the files?

62
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.650
You should've returned them...

63
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.379
when you quit your job.

64
00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.890
I'm sorry, Manager Park.

65
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.559
Is something going on?

66
00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.059
Well...

67
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.689
It's a virus.

68
00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.700
Excuse me.

(Episode 10)

70
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.970
Okay.

71
00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.610
I'll call you after the shareholders' meeting.

72
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.819
Stay quiet until then.

73
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.990
Chairman Cha.

74
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.720
Thank you for...

75
00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.889
being with my father until his last minute.

76
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.370
I'll see you soon, Hong Joo.

77
00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:09.120
Why that...

78
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:13.290
Will he come to his senses...

79
00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.030
if we take out one of his guys?

80
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.329
Not Mad Dog.

81
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:18.829
It'll cause too much damage.

82
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.300
Damage?

83
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.470
Do you still like him?

84
00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:25.269
Don't you see?

85
00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.170
Kang Woo...

86
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.240
puts himself in danger...

87
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.439
when his teammate is about to face danger.

88
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.240
If we're not careful,

89
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.509
the mad dog could run about crazier.

90
00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.819
Do you have a plan?

91
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.350
There is one...

92
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.290
who isn't his teammate.

93
00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.490
So you left Mr. Choi to get caught...

94
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.559
and came here?

95
00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:51.329
Hey.

96
00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.860
We're terribly upset too.

97
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.069
We should find a way.

98
00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:58.740
No.

99
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.470
Let's wait.

100
00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.740
What are you saying?

101
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.809
The greenhouse was a trap.

102
00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:06.939
Someone sent Mr. Choi to the funeral...

103
00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:08.610
and tried to get only us.

104
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.980
Someone used us as hostages...

105
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.180
to use Mr. Choi.

106
00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:13.949
But instead of us,

107
00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.550
only Mr. Choi fell into the trap.

108
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.290
Who did? Joo Hyun Ki?

109
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:18.790
Cha Joon Kyu?

110
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.389
That's why we need to wait and see.

111
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.530
Someone will...

112
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.730
go visit Mr. Choi.

113
00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:39.980
Executive Director Cha.

114
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.009
You aren't surprised to see me,

115
00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:43.680
Manager Choi.

116
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.420
Why should I be surprised?

117
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.720
I thought you still trusted me.

118
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.050
That's why you called...

119
00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:52.259
Ha Ri to Taeyang Insurance.

120
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:54.389
That was a case of the biter bit.

121
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.329
There's no point talking about it.

122
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:02.730
Ms. Cha.

123
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.769
What do you want?

124
00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:07.269
Ms. Cha?

125
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.939
Nothing much.

126
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.980
It's very simple.

127
00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.079
Don't do anything and just stay put.

128
00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:17.249
What?

129
00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:19.149
Until I say when,

130
00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:20.850
lay low.

131
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.420
Stay put and lay low?

132
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.019
I'm putting a leash on a mad dog.

133
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.860
So don't do anything.

134
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.290
Don't bark and stay in your doghouse.

135
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.829
What if I say no?

136
00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:34.329
It's not time...

137
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:36.600
for you to decide yet.

138
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.170
Decide after you come out and see.

139
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.899
See what?

140
00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:44.170
You won't be that heartbroken...

141
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.280
or sad.

142
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.050
We reached an agreement.

143
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.850
Let him off with a warning.

144
00:08:08.769 --> 00:08:10.629
"Decide after you come out and see."

145
00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:12.699
See what?

146
00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:19.509
- Mr. Choi. - Mr. Choi.

147
00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:24.649
You didn't have to pick me up.

148
00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.460
Here.

149
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.190
I couldn't find tofu,

150
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.830
so I brought you soy milk.

151
00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:38.960
Thanks.

152
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.299
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

153
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.830
I should've checked before I went in.

154
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.999
I was too careless.

155
00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:45.769
I'm sorry for putting you in trouble.

156
00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:48.740
Where's Kim Min Joon?

157
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.379
He went out for a run...

158
00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:54.810
to clear his head.

159
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.279
He looked upset, didn't he?

160
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.320
You won't be that heartbroken...

161
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:04.049
or sad.

162
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.759
Where is he now?

163
00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:16.429
(Mad Dog)

164
00:09:53.169 --> 00:09:54.570
Dr. Kim, pick up.

165
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.480
What? Dr. Kim's phone is moving.

166
00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:00.179
Here.

167
00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:02.279
He's going back to our office.

168
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:03.580
What?

169
00:10:04.409 --> 00:10:06.249
- To the office. - Yes, sir.

170
00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:14.259
- Kim Min Joon. - Kim Min Joon.

171
00:10:16.789 --> 00:10:18.429
- Untie him. - Okay.

172
00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:24.700
He still has pulse.

173
00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:27.200
But he's breathing weakly.

174
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.409
Breathe, Min Joon.

175
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:38.980
Ha Ri.

176
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.490
Kang Woo.

177
00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:43.519
Chee...

178
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.360
Dr. Kim!

179
00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:49.090
His breathing is fine.

180
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:51.460
Dr. Oh. Call Dr. Oh.

181
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.529
Yes, sir.

182
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.499
I don't think he should stay here.

183
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:02.409
Help me carry him.

184
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.779
(Mad Dog: A Dog Barks at the Sun)

185
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.749
He is okay.

186
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.789
The pressure wasn't that bad.

187
00:11:17.789 --> 00:11:18.860
When will he...

188
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.019
He'll wake up soon.

189
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.490
He needs to take a rest for a while.

190
00:11:24.029 --> 00:11:25.860
Thank you very much for coming.

191
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:32.039
What kind of work are you doing?

192
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.100
Well...

193
00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:34.610
It's nothing.

194
00:11:35.139 --> 00:11:36.310
Ms. Jang.

195
00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:37.810
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.210
If something like this happens to Soon Jung,

197
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.210
don't call me.

198
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.210
Pardon?

199
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.419
I don't want to see him sick.

200
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:50.850
Let's go.

201
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.560
Thank you again.

202
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.889
I'll call you.

203
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.259
Thank you.

204
00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:04.129
You should all go too.

205
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.840
Don't scatter.

206
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.210
Ha Ri, don't stay alone at home.

207
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.440
Okay. I'll be with them in the office.

208
00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:12.310
Don't worry about Ms. Jang.

209
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.509
We'll protect her.

210
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:14.549
I'll take care of myself.

211
00:12:14.549 --> 00:12:15.710
Get some rest, Mr. Choi.

212
00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:18.120
Call me when he wakes up.

213
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.419
Okay.

214
00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:24.519
Bye.

215
00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:39.590
Hey, Kim Min Joon.

216
00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:41.429
What are you doing there?

217
00:14:41.429 --> 00:14:42.560
You're awake.

218
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.860
Aren't you hungry?

219
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.799
I'm starving.

220
00:14:49.929 --> 00:14:50.929
Are you okay?

221
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.070
It hurts.

222
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.639
Who did that to you?

223
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.980
I don't know. I didn't get to see the face.

224
00:15:00.009 --> 00:15:03.110
I guess it was Mr. Lee Young Ho of Juhan Air.

225
00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:06.549
It's similar to what he did to Ko Jin Chul.

226
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.220
Hey.

227
00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:11.560
Where did you get that from?

228
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.860
Did you step outside?

229
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.690
Your fridge was way too empty.

230
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.629
You only had soju, water,

231
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:22.100
inedible kimchi that went bad,

232
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.669
and frozen food...

233
00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:25.669
that passed its expiration date.

234
00:15:25.669 --> 00:15:26.669
Hey.

235
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:29.340
Don't you know why I brought you here?

236
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.879
It's for you to stay here without going anywhere.

237
00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:34.850
Okay, okay.

238
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.980
I'll stay put here without going anywhere.

239
00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:41.049
You're really the type that nags too much.

240
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.289
I'll hear the rest of your nagging...

241
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:46.289
after we finish eating first.

242
00:15:48.929 --> 00:15:50.029
Aren't you eating?

243
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.999
I'm great at making soup.

244
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.080
Where did you learn how to make seaweed soup?

245
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.149
Mija Gebauer's...

246
00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:19.860
hometown was some kind of an island.

247
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.560
It had a lot of seaweed there.

248
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.289
She loved seaweed soup.

249
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.560
So I learned very hard...

250
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.929
to win her favor.

251
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:34.340
What do you think? Isn't it amazing?

252
00:16:35.009 --> 00:16:36.039
It's not bad.

253
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.330
What?

254
00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:58.759
Is it salty?

255
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:03.800
It's been a while.

256
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.270
What is?

257
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:09.310
Having a meal with someone in this house.

258
00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.080
It's delicious.

259
00:17:32.229 --> 00:17:34.600
I heard the extraordinary shareholders' meeting...

260
00:17:34.969 --> 00:17:36.600
of JH Group will take place early next week.

261
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.639
It's Monday as far as I know.

262
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:41.370
The chief prosecutor is waiting for the timing.

263
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.270
He wants to demand a 10-year sentence...

264
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.780
and fine Vice President Joo 200 million dollars...

265
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.610
for embezzlement and malpractice.

266
00:17:49.149 --> 00:17:50.209
The first trial...

267
00:17:50.709 --> 00:17:52.879
might end in sentencing him to four years in jail.

268
00:17:53.719 --> 00:17:55.320
It'll be meaningless...

269
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.419
if they let him go in the 2nd or 3rd trial,

270
00:17:57.419 --> 00:17:59.159
giving him probation instead.

271
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.600
Hyun Ki staying only a short while in jail...

272
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.000
should never happen.

273
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.669
If we accuse him of more charges and charge him...

274
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:11.000
for the illegal takeover of management right,

275
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.100
I'm worried it might harm you as well.

276
00:18:17.469 --> 00:18:19.879
What do I have to do with...

277
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.780
the succession of JH's management right?

278
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.620
Is that right?

279
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.350
Then...

280
00:18:26.649 --> 00:18:28.520
shall we just accuse him of that as well?

281
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.659
I was just saying.

282
00:18:37.899 --> 00:18:41.370
I watched an interesting video clip a few days ago.

283
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.000
The brother of the assistant pilot...

284
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.270
who crashed the plane two years ago appeared in it.

285
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.010
It also talked about the 3.4 million dollars.

286
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.179
I'm not sure if it's beneficial...

287
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.250
for Taeyang Insurance...

288
00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.149
to be talked about in JH Group's issue.

289
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.389
Like I already warned you before,

290
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.560
don't cause any scandal.

291
00:19:06.159 --> 00:19:07.590
Things are like...

292
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.689
the eye of a typhoon now.

293
00:19:10.659 --> 00:19:13.129
It's better for you...

294
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.070
to stay low from now on.

295
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.399
I'm sorry...

296
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.239
for troubling you.

297
00:19:28.179 --> 00:19:29.550
"Don't do anything..."

298
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.080
"and stay put."

299
00:19:32.179 --> 00:19:34.179
Ms. Cha is showing her true intention...

300
00:19:34.179 --> 00:19:35.419
all of a sudden.

301
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.989
I don't think she wanted to kill you for real.

302
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.719
The doctor said...

303
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.360
that the pressure wasn't too hard.

304
00:19:42.629 --> 00:19:43.790
I know.

305
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.600
She only threatened me...

306
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.929
that she'll really kill me if I don't stay put.

307
00:19:49.169 --> 00:19:50.600
Why do they...

308
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.600
keep stressing others to stay still?

309
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.439
It's next week.

310
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.340
Let's please not...

311
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.709
cause any trouble until then.

312
00:19:58.709 --> 00:20:00.879
What if it didn't mean the funeral...

313
00:20:01.449 --> 00:20:03.679
when Vice President Joo talked about next week?

314
00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:04.850
So there's another issue...

315
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.520
that Taeyang and JH Group have to...

316
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.189
take care of quietly without drawing attention.

317
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.590
Then...

318
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.929
we should bark loudly...

319
00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:17.729
and draw everyone's attention.

320
00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:19.659
- Don't. - What?

321
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.030
Detective Jo's daughter...

322
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.040
is getting her surgery two days from now.

323
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.600
So you'll really stay put?

324
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.639
You'll be a silent dog just like this?

325
00:20:32.739 --> 00:20:34.879
That sounds cool.

326
00:20:35.449 --> 00:20:36.780
A silent dog.

327
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.820
- Mr. Kang. - Until the surgery ends,

328
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.520
let's stay quiet...

329
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.419
and prepare for a huge ruckus.

330
00:20:48.189 --> 00:20:49.189
All right.

331
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.760
(Security Card)

332
00:20:53.429 --> 00:20:55.100
Don't they suspect you in the company?

333
00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.070
So far, so good.

334
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.870
I'm sorry that you had to...

335
00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:02.709
step down from your position because of me.

336
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:04.679
Kang Woo.

337
00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:06.939
Did you forget what you told me last time?

338
00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.550
You said not to say sorry anymore.

339
00:21:10.209 --> 00:21:11.449
Same here.

340
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:13.479
I stepped down because I didn't do a proper job...

341
00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:15.889
in investigating the case two years ago.

342
00:21:15.889 --> 00:21:17.090
So don't say sorry.

343
00:21:18.419 --> 00:21:20.760
So what do I have to do now?

344
00:21:21.229 --> 00:21:23.090
- What? - Tell me already.

345
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.070
Hey.

346
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.439
How much is the unpaid claims...

347
00:21:32.439 --> 00:21:34.199
and dormant premium that Taeyang has to pay?

348
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.870
There must be quite a lot left.

349
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.909
The unpaid claims is about 10 million dollars.

350
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.540
I bet there's more for the dormant premium.

351
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.949
I need to see the list.

352
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:43.280
Why?

353
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.620
Are you going to retrieve unpaid insurance money...

354
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.850
for people?

355
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:46.949
Why can't I?

356
00:21:46.949 --> 00:21:49.020
It's the money they must pay by the law.

357
00:21:52.489 --> 00:21:55.260
(List of unpaid claims)

358
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.229
"Unpaid claims"...

359
00:21:57.229 --> 00:21:59.000
and "dormant premiums"?

360
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.199
Unpaid claims is the money...

361
00:22:01.199 --> 00:22:03.199
that the insurance company must pay,

362
00:22:03.199 --> 00:22:05.500
but that hasn't been paid due to some excuses.

363
00:22:06.139 --> 00:22:07.439
Dormant premium is the money...

364
00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:09.310
that stays dormant in the company...

365
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.709
since the beneficiaries haven't claimed...

366
00:22:11.709 --> 00:22:13.679
their insurance money, right?

367
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.449
According to the data sent by Mr. Park,

368
00:22:17.449 --> 00:22:18.949
Taeyang has the unpaid claims...

369
00:22:18.949 --> 00:22:20.479
worth 10 million dollars...

370
00:22:20.479 --> 00:22:22.350
and the dormant premium worth 200 million dollars.

371
00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:24.050
They paid quite a lot though.

372
00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.060
But there's a lot more to pay.

373
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.090
There are almost...

374
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.189
a billion-dollar worth dormant premiums...

375
00:22:29.189 --> 00:22:31.429
in all the insurance companies this year.

376
00:22:31.699 --> 00:22:34.360
Why do people not claim that money?

377
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.530
As they repeat joining and canceling insurances,

378
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.340
they forget which insurance they signed for.

379
00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.739
There's also the case...

380
00:22:41.739 --> 00:22:43.639
where the beneficiary passes away.

381
00:22:43.639 --> 00:22:45.810
Losing contact seems to be most common.

382
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.610
By the way, why should we help retrieve...

383
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.379
their insurance money that they didn't claim?

384
00:22:50.649 --> 00:22:52.679
It's not time we should do this kind of stuff.

385
00:22:52.679 --> 00:22:55.590
Taeyang paid you 3.4 million dollars so easily.

386
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.850
But they dawdled so much not to pay...

387
00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.389
the bereaved of those...

388
00:22:59.389 --> 00:23:00.790
who really killed themselves.

389
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.330
And they ignored the court's judgement...

390
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.060
to pay the money even if they were suspicious...

391
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.159
whether it was really a suicide.

392
00:23:07.399 --> 00:23:08.399
So what?

393
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.770
Mr. Kim, come on.

394
00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:15.040
"Financial Supervisory Service..."

395
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.639
"Forewarns a Severe Disciplinary Action..."

396
00:23:16.639 --> 00:23:18.179
"Against Unpaid Insurance Claims"?

397
00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:21.580
"They forewarned insurance companies..."

398
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.350
"who refused to pay claims for suicide cases..."

399
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.149
"of an extremely severe disciplinary action."

400
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.850
What if the world finds out...

401
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.790
that Taeyang Insurance has not been paying...

402
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.419
insurance claims for suicide cases?

403
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.260
Financial Supervisory Service will step in.

404
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.590
In that case, what do we have to do?

405
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.729
Find those people who are lost in touch,

406
00:23:40.729 --> 00:23:42.399
and give out the unclaimed sum.

407
00:23:42.399 --> 00:23:43.800
Then naturally...

408
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.100
We'll find the family who didn't get...

409
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.300
the insurance money after their family's suicide.

410
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.709
Then we borrow the voices of those people...

411
00:23:48.709 --> 00:23:50.540
to impose a disciplinary action to the company.

412
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.310
Including reprimanding the top-level management.

413
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:53.939
Wait.

414
00:23:54.479 --> 00:23:57.010
I thought Ms. Cha was a part of the management.

415
00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.419
It looks like Taeyang Insurance...

416
00:24:00.419 --> 00:24:02.389
will get caught in trouble once again.

417
00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.120
I guess so.

418
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.620
Taeyang Insurance's...

419
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.429
Executive Director Cha.

420
00:24:24.709 --> 00:24:26.310
What are you thinking about?

421
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.149
You didn't even notice that I came, Hong Joo.

422
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.280
Get out of here.

423
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.409
Finally.

424
00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.979
Seeing you finally awakened like this...

425
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:35.219
makes me think, like dad, like daughter.

426
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.290
I told you to get out.

427
00:24:38.419 --> 00:24:40.090
I don't want to leave by myself.

428
00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:44.860
Do you want to go eat some feet of chicken?

429
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.570
I guess you don't eat those anymore.

430
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:11.219
I guess you liked him a lot.

431
00:25:11.689 --> 00:25:12.719
No.

432
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.760
It's a bit weird to say you liked a married guy.

433
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.959
I liked him.

434
00:25:17.729 --> 00:25:19.659
I tried everything I can...

435
00:25:22.169 --> 00:25:23.469
to not get caught.

436
00:25:24.969 --> 00:25:26.739
His wife was too good of a person...

437
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.709
for me to hate or get jealous of her.

438
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.379
And Ju Won was like a nephew to me.

439
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.510
Yet you still let them get on that plane.

440
00:25:38.179 --> 00:25:39.379
Mr. Joo.

441
00:25:39.879 --> 00:25:41.719
You know that it's not the case.

442
00:25:41.719 --> 00:25:42.750
Right.

443
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.760
I know that it's not the case.

444
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.790
How would you know that plane would crash?

445
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:48.959
All you did was...

446
00:25:48.959 --> 00:25:50.959
let us get into an insurance contract...

447
00:25:50.959 --> 00:25:52.929
knowing that we had deficient airplanes.

448
00:25:53.459 --> 00:25:55.070
Even I have forgotten about...

449
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.500
which aircraft it was...

450
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.340
and when and where it was headed.

451
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.000
You said you liked him,

452
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:03.840
so I said that because I wanted to hurt you.

453
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:06.879
I'm sorry.

454
00:26:08.949 --> 00:26:10.310
Are you that distressed?

455
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.250
Then go tell him.

456
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.020
Confess what you did and ask for forgiveness.

457
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.889
All you did was turn a blind eye just once.

458
00:26:16.989 --> 00:26:20.090
It's the only mistake you made in your life.

459
00:26:20.189 --> 00:26:21.330
Mr. Joo.

460
00:26:22.629 --> 00:26:24.459
We're not the ones to decide...

461
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.530
if it was a mistake or not.

462
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.000
Then who is it up to?

463
00:26:31.899 --> 00:26:32.969
The victims.

464
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:36.669
The family of the victims.

465
00:26:40.709 --> 00:26:41.850
Cha Hong Joo.

466
00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:44.620
You and I can make that decision.

467
00:26:44.979 --> 00:26:46.280
It's what we did.

468
00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.050
Why would anyone else decide what that was?

469
00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.520
You and I just made a mistake.

470
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.790
A small, minor mistake.

471
00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:02.570
Take your hands off of me.

472
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.100
Sorry.

473
00:27:17.979 --> 00:27:19.050
Ms. Oh.

474
00:27:23.449 --> 00:27:24.659
I can't help you anymore.

475
00:27:24.889 --> 00:27:25.989
With what?

476
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.659
The charts.

477
00:27:29.959 --> 00:27:31.560
It looks like you're dressed up...

478
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.399
to fight against that handsome...

479
00:27:35.399 --> 00:27:37.500
yet arrogant young man.

480
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.500
The handsome yet arrogant young man?

481
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.770
Mr. Kim?

482
00:27:42.439 --> 00:27:43.870
He is arrogant,

483
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.810
but he's not handsome.

484
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.639
His skin is so pale and lips are so red.

485
00:27:47.639 --> 00:27:50.709
He seems like a vampire from the middle ages...

486
00:27:50.709 --> 00:27:52.879
who was never exposed to any sunlight for life.

487
00:27:52.879 --> 00:27:54.219
Forget it.

488
00:27:54.379 --> 00:27:56.050
He's not your rival.

489
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.590
It's a fight only for you.

490
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.659
Fine.

491
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.290
Ms. Oh, will you please take another look?

492
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:05.560
My concept for the day is a fabulous guy.

493
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.399
A fabulous guy?

494
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.129
Yes, I'm the most fabulous...

495
00:28:14.469 --> 00:28:15.870
Robin Hood.

496
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.540
Will you be my partner today?

497
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.610
No, thanks.

498
00:28:19.639 --> 00:28:21.040
Ms. Oh. Ms. Oh!

499
00:28:21.139 --> 00:28:22.280
The insurance money?

500
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.750
Yes. Last April, your husband was...

501
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.820
diagnosed with a fourth-stage...

502
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.919
metastatic pulmonary cancer in Hanju Hospital.

503
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.020
He gets high-frequency treatments, as well as...

504
00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.320
mistletoe, thymosin injections, and pills.

505
00:28:34.929 --> 00:28:38.000
However, the insurance company refused to pay...

506
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.860
because his treatments are conservative treatments,

507
00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.159
not direct treatments.

508
00:28:41.469 --> 00:28:42.729
How do you know that?

509
00:28:42.729 --> 00:28:44.370
There is an angel...

510
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.540
in a white uniform in Hanju Hospital.

511
00:28:48.639 --> 00:28:50.209
Mr. Kang's guardian.

512
00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:52.310
He may look odd,

513
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.979

Come on, Ms. Oh.

515
00:28:57.209 --> 00:28:59.719
They refused to pay the amount because...

516
00:28:59.719 --> 00:29:01.350
the contract was ambiguous about its terms.

517
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.219
Even if he gets indirect treatments,

518
00:29:03.219 --> 00:29:04.959
the rules are to pay...

519
00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:07.090
the amount in full if he has cancer.

520
00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.929
Then how can I get the rest of the money?

521
00:29:09.929 --> 00:29:12.500
Should I get it for you?

522
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.699

You called again.

544
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.590
Pardon? You called again...

545
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.219
because you liked my voice?

Right.

- Yes, sir. I'm listening. - I know you're joking.

00:31:41.209 --> 00:31:44.850
In 2015, he was 138cm tall.

576
00:31:48.489 --> 00:31:49.550
Get out.

about my brother.

580
00:31:56.959 --> 00:31:59.100
I really have nothing, so it feels empty...

581
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.800
whenever I think about him.

No, that doesn't count.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.959
Dad, can you just measure me now?

590
00:32:28.959 --> 00:32:31.129
I told you, I can't.

591

decided, Mr. Choi?

Taeyang and I have nothing to do with it.

Don't lie to me.

613
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.500
You avoid my eyes when you do.

614
00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:20.670
Don't act like you know.

615

You didn't do it?

You didn't do anything?

623
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.920
I just made a decision...

624
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.429

625
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.730
What is that?

626
00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:48.600
Taeyang Insurance...

628
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.100

630
00:34:54.839 --> 00:34:55.839
Yes.

631
00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.639
The most important things to me...

632
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.350

633
00:35:03.509 --> 00:35:04.509
Yes.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.080
Rightfully so.

635
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:08.850
Hong Joo.

636
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:13.290
I really don't know who you are now.

637
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.299
That's a relief.

638
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.859
Mr. Choi.

639
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:24.400
If you stay put, you'll be fine.

Nothing will happen.

641

So...

642
00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.370
stay curled up.

643
00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:33.739

645
00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:00.370
After HJ meeting,

646
00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.870
he arrived in a pub in Gangam-dong.

647
00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.580
Nothing significant to report.

648
00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.850
Where did your guys say...

649
00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.449
he was?

650
00:36:16.449 --> 00:36:18.460
They said he was in a pub in Gangam-dong.

651
00:36:19.319 --> 00:36:20.319
Is that right?

652
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.730
Proceed with the surgery tomorrow as planned.

653
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:24.859
Yes, sir.

654
00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:52.420
I told them you were here.

655
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:53.889
Don't go anywhere else,

656
00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:55.330
and go straight home.

657
00:36:55.859 --> 00:36:57.029

658
00:37:05.639 --> 00:37:06.839
It's so nerve wrecking.

659
00:37:07.699 --> 00:37:09.739
This isn't operation 007.

660
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:10.909

661
00:37:10.909 --> 00:37:12.239
Hey. You know...

662
00:37:12.239 --> 00:37:14.949
I'm a seasoned claims examiner of 16 years.

663
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:17.250
You're so popular these days.

664
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.580
I saw Detective Jo...

665
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.080
and another team outside.

666
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.819
That's Chairman Cha.

667
00:37:24.859 --> 00:37:26.560
You don't drink...

668
00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.589

669
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:28.759
Pour me a glass.

670
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.259
You punk.

671
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.730
We haven't been here in so long.

672
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.400
We had a drink here when Director Cha...

673
00:37:38.469 --> 00:37:40.600
was a newbie in the claims examination team.

674
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.639
Did we?

675
00:37:42.509 --> 00:37:44.609
- I don't remember. - No way.

676
00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:47.739
It's better to forget, I guess.

677
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.909
What happened with the unpaid claims?

678
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.449
Hwan Hee has her surgery tomorrow morning.

679
00:37:55.219 --> 00:37:57.489
We'll get busy starting tomorrow afternoon.

680
00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.920
Is that so?

681
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.020
That's good.

682
00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.589
We should get to work.

683
00:38:21.509 --> 00:38:23.009
Why are you home so late?

684
00:38:23.049 --> 00:38:24.679
Did you eat dinner?

685
00:38:30.949 --> 00:38:32.819
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

686
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.589
Did you drink again?

687
00:38:35.759 --> 00:38:37.630
Aren't you drinking too often?

688
00:38:37.759 --> 00:38:39.500
- Stop it. - Stop what?

689
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.529
Don't ask me why I'm late,

690
00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:41.830
why I drank again,

691
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.100
or anything like that.

692
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.270
Well, it's because we live together...

693
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.040
We're not living together.

694
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.080
I guess you're right.

695
00:39:44.029 --> 00:39:45.060
Hey, Min Joon.

696
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:52.969
Do you really want to die?

697
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.409
You went out again.

698
00:39:55.969 --> 00:39:58.639
Are you crazy? They're tailing me too.

699
00:39:58.639 --> 00:40:01.210
I didn't step outside, not even for a second.

700
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:04.449
What's all that in the fridge then?

701
00:40:06.049 --> 00:40:08.150
Ha Ri brought those yesterday.

702
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.489
Seriously, don't worry.

703
00:40:11.489 --> 00:40:12.719
Until the work is done,

704
00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:14.630
until I come to you,

705
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.389
I will never get killed.

706
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.859
Detective Jo's daughter...

707
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.560
went in for her surgery.

708
00:40:21.569 --> 00:40:23.370
He'll call when it's over.

709
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.469
You were so concerned about Hwan Hee's surgery,

710
00:40:26.469 --> 00:40:28.540
but you came home drunk and slept in.

711
00:40:30.609 --> 00:40:31.639
What?

712
00:40:34.909 --> 00:40:36.409
Gosh.

713
00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.359
Is this his house?

714
00:40:54.259 --> 00:40:55.799
Goodness.

715
00:41:06.339 --> 00:41:09.980
(Operating room)

716
00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.380
The surgery went well.

717
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.920
You don't need to worry.

718
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.980
Thank you.

719
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.319
- Thank you. - Thank you.

720
00:41:17.489 --> 00:41:19.389
- Honey. - It's over now.

721
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.400
Hwan Hee's surgery went well.

722
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:32.670
Thank you.

723
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:34.370
I resigned today.

724
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.980
Hi, Kang Woo.

725
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.889
Things will get crazy now.

726
00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.150
- You... - My brother-in-law's...

727
00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.989
cousin found a job for me...

728
00:41:53.659 --> 00:41:55.190
in a security company in Busan.

729
00:41:56.029 --> 00:41:57.790
So don't worry about me,

730
00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.900
and do everything you want.

731
00:42:00.799 --> 00:42:01.830
What about Hwan Hee?

732
00:42:02.029 --> 00:42:03.600
She's my daughter.

733
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.540
I'll look after her. Don't worry.

734
00:42:06.469 --> 00:42:07.469
And...

735
00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.409
I'm sorry.

736
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:10.940
I know.

737
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.179
Take care.

738
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.029
Yes, Mr. Choi.

739
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:29.330
Let's start.

740
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.000
Noo Ri. Upload all the files we collected...

741
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.299
on the Financial Supervisory Service site.

742
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.500
Okay.

743
00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:40.040
Please call Dr. Kim too.

744
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.370
Isn't he already on the line?

745
00:42:42.609 --> 00:42:44.710
I couldn't get a hold of him.

746
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:45.710
What?

747
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:46.710
What?

748
00:43:01.429 --> 00:43:03.029
Kim Min Joon, you punk.

749
00:43:04.529 --> 00:43:06.600
The phone is turned off.

750
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.469
Please leave a message after the beep.

751
00:43:09.469 --> 00:43:11.170
Kim Min Joon, this crazy punk.

752
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:17.310
Ms. Cho Kyung Eun?

753
00:43:18.639 --> 00:43:19.810
You have...

754
00:43:20.679 --> 00:43:22.109
such a nice voice.

755
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:23.880
Thank you.

756
00:43:25.049 --> 00:43:26.179
Ha Eun...

757
00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.319
I mean, my sister...

758
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.989
liked people...

759
00:43:31.719 --> 00:43:33.159
with nice voices.

760
00:43:36.659 --> 00:43:38.199
Is there anyone...

761
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.799
who's related to a suicide benefit...

762
00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:43.330
among those who called Mr. Kim?

763
00:43:43.529 --> 00:43:45.270
There is. Her name is Cho Kyung Eun.

764
00:43:45.339 --> 00:43:46.440
Cho Kyung Eun?

765
00:43:46.739 --> 00:43:48.770
The one who liked his voice and called again?

766
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:49.810
What?

767
00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:50.940
Nothing.

768
00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.409
How is she related to...

769
00:43:52.409 --> 00:43:53.810
a suicide benefit?

770
00:43:55.509 --> 00:43:56.549
Cho Ha Eun.

771
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:58.449
She's Cho Kyung Eun's little sister.

772
00:43:58.449 --> 00:44:00.920
She was 17 years old when she died in 2015.

773
00:44:01.219 --> 00:44:03.719
She fell from a rooftop and died.

774
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:05.489
They found sleeping pills...

775
00:44:05.489 --> 00:44:07.020
in her bag.

776
00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.630
She didn't kill herself.

777
00:44:11.799 --> 00:44:13.259
Taeyang claims...

778
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.500
that it's a suicide case because they found...

779
00:44:15.799 --> 00:44:17.330
sleeping pills in her bag.

780
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:19.839
But there wasn't any composition...

781
00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:21.810
of sleeping pills found in her body.

782
00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.109
When exactly did Taeyang...

783
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:25.339
reject your claim?

784
00:44:25.339 --> 00:44:28.710
It was November 20, 2015.

785
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.580
Did you confirm it yourself?

786
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:31.620
Yes.

787
00:44:32.049 --> 00:44:35.150
November 20, 2015.

788
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:36.850
(Rejected)

789
00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:38.819
Mr. Choi, it's November 20, 2015...

790
00:44:38.819 --> 00:44:41.259
when Taeyang rejected to pay...

791
00:44:41.259 --> 00:44:43.560
Ms. Cho the insurance money.

792
00:44:44.929 --> 00:44:46.859
November 20, 2015.

793
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.799
That's the day when Taeyang paid...

794
00:44:50.529 --> 00:44:53.199
Kim Bum Joon the suicide benefit.

795
00:44:54.239 --> 00:44:56.739
The two claims got submitted on the same day,

796
00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:58.880
but Taeyang paid for your brother...

797
00:44:59.109 --> 00:45:01.250
and didn't pay Ms. Cho until now.

798
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.310
I should write the article about the issue, right?

799
00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.650
Right.

800
00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.819
You can interview me exclusively...

801
00:45:08.819 --> 00:45:10.819
after you release the article.

802
00:45:10.819 --> 00:45:13.819
You believe that your brother...

803
00:45:13.819 --> 00:45:16.089
didn't crash the plane on purpose?

804
00:45:16.989 --> 00:45:19.199
Is that important?

805
00:45:19.199 --> 00:45:20.199
What?

806
00:45:20.199 --> 00:45:23.630
I realized something in the past two years.

807
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:26.770
My opinion doesn't matter at all.

808
00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:28.670
Then what does?

809
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:31.810
It matters how we should make people think,

810
00:45:32.009 --> 00:45:33.310
suspect, and remember...

811
00:45:34.239 --> 00:45:36.810
on their own.

812
00:45:43.049 --> 00:45:44.690
I'll go to her house first then.

813
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:45.690
Hold on.

814
00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.130
There's something written...

815
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:49.290
on the note in her claim.

816
00:45:50.659 --> 00:45:52.000
Mad Dog,

817
00:45:52.359 --> 00:45:54.529
keep an eye on Reporter Bang's blog.

818
00:45:54.529 --> 00:45:57.330
I think this punk's scheming something big.

819
00:45:57.799 --> 00:45:59.540
Then we should simply take this.

820
00:46:00.469 --> 00:46:02.639
Noo Ri. Knock down every server of...

821
00:46:02.639 --> 00:46:04.339
Taeyang Insurance,

822
00:46:04.339 --> 00:46:05.710
Financial Supervisory Service,

823
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:07.040
and Life Insurance Association.

824
00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.049
Okay.

825
00:46:08.909 --> 00:46:10.580
Get me Reporter Bang's location.

826
00:46:11.179 --> 00:46:12.250
Let's take down Mr. Kim first...

827
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:13.850
before they do.

828
00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:15.690
Mr. Choi, you're being tailed.

829
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:16.690
I'll go...

830
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:19.020
Ha Ri, Lee Young Ho might chase him again.

831
00:46:19.219 --> 00:46:21.159
I'll do it. I'll take care of it.

832
00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.759
Sit down.

833
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.799
Search every acquaintance of Reporter Bang.

834
00:46:26.799 --> 00:46:28.600
Send me all the related locations.

835
00:46:28.699 --> 00:46:29.900
Yes, sir.

836
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:34.639
Aren't you drinking too often?

837
00:46:34.639 --> 00:46:35.639
Stop.

838
00:46:35.639 --> 00:46:37.270
Well, it's because we live together...

839
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:39.109
We're not living together.

840
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.589
What are you talking about?

841
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.089
The server is down?

842
00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:58.699
It's because of the unpaid claims.

843
00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.929
The beneficiaries are claiming for it suddenly.

844
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.100
(Taeyang Insurance)

845
00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.509
(The website has exceeded its traffic capacity.)

846
00:47:11.009 --> 00:47:12.679
Call the data processing team...

847
00:47:12.679 --> 00:47:13.940
for the restore work.

848
00:47:14.779 --> 00:47:16.810
What about the unpaid claims?

849
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.719
There are too many claims to examine.

850
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.949
How much is the total amount...

851
00:47:20.949 --> 00:47:22.190
of the unpaid claims?

852
00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.589
About 2.1 million dollars for just today.

853
00:47:25.889 --> 00:47:27.060

Yes, ma'am.

Is this how you handle your work?

Financial Supervisory Service has called us.

862
00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:57.089
Their customer's service is going crazy...

It's Kang Woo.

He must be behind this.

868

How did he...

869
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:13.600
Even so,

870
00:48:13.699 --> 00:48:15.310
I can handle this.

871
00:48:15.509 --> 00:48:17.069
By paying the insurance money?

872
00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:18.980
How will you pay them...

873
00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.279
when the money's already out of our hands?

874

We haven't paid the unpaid claims yet.

Is it about Taeyang?

No, that's not it.

Yes. Here's what I find very odd.

1022
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:12.219
I have eyes and ears too.

1023
00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.650
Do you know how good my eyesight is?

1024
00:56:15.389 --> 00:56:17.549
They're 20-20.

1025
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.190
What on earth are you talking about?

1026
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.230
I'm saying that I have eyes too.

1027
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:49.319
Choi Kang Woo.

1028
00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.230
Will you be all right?

1029
00:56:57.359 --> 00:56:58.529
What about you?

1030
00:56:58.699 --> 00:56:59.859
Will you be all right?

1031
00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.569
Like you said, the worst thing...

1032
00:57:01.569 --> 00:57:03.029
that could happen is for me to die.

1033
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:05.870
But still, let's live.

1034
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.699
Both of us should live.

1035
00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:09.710
Yes, let's live.

1036
00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:24.120
Jan Gebauer.

1037
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.029
Kim Min Joon.

1038
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:36.929
Jang Ha Ri.

1039
00:57:37.429 --> 00:57:38.500
Mr. Choi.

1040
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:43.239
Ms. Jang.

1041
00:57:44.239 --> 00:57:45.710
Were you worried about me?

1042
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.279
I wasn't worried.

1043
00:57:47.409 --> 00:57:48.909
You were really worried.

1044
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:50.380
When was I?

1045
00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.620
Your feelings can't be covered up.

1046
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:55.690
Mr. Choi, great job.

1047
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:58.520
Park Soon Jung.

1048
00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.630
Well, they aren't that important.

1049
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:09.500
It's this guy.

1050
00:58:11.739 --> 00:58:13.299
Great job, Mr. Choi.

1051
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.770
Mr. Kim. Will you stop causing trouble?

1052
00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:19.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

1053
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.080
Then shall we go get some meat today?

1054
00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.750
Yes. Let's eat beef.

1055
00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:26.980
We aren't making any money. Let's get pork.

1056
00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:27.989
Let's go with beef.

1057
00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.190
It's on me.

1058
00:58:31.759 --> 00:58:33.920
Gosh, it's Mr. Landlord.

1059
00:58:33.989 --> 00:58:35.759
- Yes! - Let's go.

1060
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:37.230
Let's go.

1061
00:58:40.259 --> 00:58:42.400
(Father)

1062
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:45.739
This guy is a gem.

1063
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:48.969
That must be why...

1064
00:58:48.969 --> 00:58:50.739
you never told me about him,

1065
00:58:50.739 --> 00:58:52.139
Chairman Cha.

1066
00:58:53.339 --> 00:58:54.440
Oh, no.

1067
00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.150
Hong Joo, you knew him too.

1068
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:58.650
Since you two are...

1069
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:00.980
family.

1070
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:03.549
Pentium, come on. Let's go.

1071
00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.190
Give me a moment.

1072
00:59:07.089 --> 00:59:08.759
I have to take this.

1073
00:59:09.089 --> 00:59:11.089
- Take it. - Is he dating someone?

1074
00:59:11.359 --> 00:59:12.359
Come on.

1075
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.569
He lured her with his innocent face.

1076
00:59:15.569 --> 00:59:18.540
He's all grown up now.

1077
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:19.900
Hey, look at this.

1078
00:59:20.199 --> 00:59:21.770
Will you please stop?

1079
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:24.409
- What about this? - It's not done yet.

1080
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:27.710
Yes?

1081
00:59:28.779 --> 00:59:29.980
Father.

1082
00:59:30.179 --> 00:59:32.020
I told you to stay under the radar.

1083
00:59:32.449 --> 00:59:34.250
What have you been up to?

1084
00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.989
On Noo Ri.

1085
00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:39.190
The eldest son of Chief On Joo Sik.

1086
00:59:43.529 --> 00:59:45.400
Don't touch him.

1087
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.100
- Why not? - You aren't...

1088
00:59:49.199 --> 00:59:50.469
supposed to harm family members.

1089
00:59:50.969 --> 00:59:52.199
Right, Hong Joo?

1090
00:59:53.199 --> 00:59:54.299
You aren't...

1091
00:59:58.279 --> 00:59:59.839
supposed to harm family members.

1092
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:04.150
What now?

1093
01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.790
Should I take in these dogs for you?

1094
01:00:11.389 --> 01:00:12.460
On Noo Ri.

1095
01:00:12.889 --> 01:00:14.560
Stop what you're doing and leave them.

1096
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.960
Father.

1097
01:00:16.159 --> 01:00:17.230
Leave now.
