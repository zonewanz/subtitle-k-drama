00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.127
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:14.564
You're embarrassing me. I'm not a baby.

3
00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:15.999
You didn't have to take me 
to work on my first day.

4
00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.269
I had a bad dream. 
I didn't want you to drive.

5
00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.837
Be careful today.

6
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:22.639
- Do your best at work. - Stop there.

7
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:24.141
I'm not going to the military.

8
00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:25.942
Please go now.

9
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.645
Goodbye.

10
00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:42.559
Do as I told you yesterday 
for that problem.

11
00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:53.837
Chairman?

12
00:00:55.772 --> 00:00:56.773
Is that her?

13
00:00:59.443 --> 00:01:00.811
Wait a minute. Wait up!

14
00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:03.814
- Wait a minute. Stop. - Chairman.

15
00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:05.315
Stop for a moment.

16
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:10.220
- It's me. - Yes.

17
00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:12.055
- I just dropped him off. - Really?

18
00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:14.057
I'll hurry. Let's eat together.

19
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:16.093
I love you too.

20
00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:25.469
That surely was Anna.

21
00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:27.604
What's wrong?

22
00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:33.477
Did you say we were meeting 
the new employees today?

23
00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:35.979
Let's go.

24
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.118
Anna?

25
00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:55.966
(Congratulations on joining the
 new Menu Research and Development Team)

26
00:01:57.968 --> 00:01:59.102
I can't believe this.

27
00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.660
What are you doing?

28
00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:27.764
Are you here already?

29
00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:31.301
What's wrong? Did something happen?

30
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.802
No, it's nothing.

31
00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:35.472
Something must have happened. 
Your eyes are full of tears.

32
00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:37.541
Tell me. What is it?

33
00:02:41.144 --> 00:02:43.780
It's just that...

34
00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:47.017
I'm moved.

35
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.788
Everyone treated me as a loser.

36
00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:57.294
I'm so happy that I finally 
have a position in this society.

37
00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:02.599
My eyes kept welling...

38
00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.035
even when I was on the 
subway on my way to work.

39
00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:08.338
It felt like a dream that I was 
among the people going to work...

40
00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:11.208
while wearing a suit.

41
00:03:13.143 --> 00:03:16.846
Anyway, you're my savior.

42
00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:18.281
Thank you.

43
00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.319
You're the one who moved me.

44
00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:24.854
You move me all the time.

45
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.289
I do?

46
00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.558
Ru Ri, don't forget.

47
00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.494
This place is always empty for you.

48
00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:33.830
Is it here?

49
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.300
Goodness. Stop joking.

50
00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:39.202
It hurts.

51
00:03:39.202 --> 00:03:41.004
Wasn't that quite strong?

52
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:46.509
Do you know about our future plans?

53
00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:49.746
Yes, you will find a successor from our company.

54
00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:51.881
Please find a capable person, since the future of...

55
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:54.517
SC Food and Beverage depends on it.

56
00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:57.254
If people find out Jung Tae Yang joined through connections,

57
00:03:57.254 --> 00:03:59.556
they will resist strongly.

58
00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:04.527
Isn't having more competitors profitable to the company?

59
00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:12.202
- Chairman Kevin. - Yes.

60
00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.505
Manager Joo's flight has been delayed, so she will be late.

61
00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:17.540
Manager Joo?

62
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.542
She is the new manager of the menu development team.

63
00:04:20.143 --> 00:04:24.347
She's my daughter, but evaluate her without any strings attached.

64
00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:26.483
Let's start without her.

65
00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:34.357
Did the Chairman Kevin have a daughter?

66
00:04:34.591 --> 00:04:35.759
I never heard about it.

67
00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:38.094
I heard he was a celibate for his whole life.

68
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.297
Why do things keep going wrong?

69
00:04:41.298 --> 00:04:43.933
Find out what happened.

70
00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:45.302
Yes, ma'am.

71
00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:53.743
Are you having fun watching us?

72
00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.981
Keep your eyes on the front, and drive properly.

73
00:04:58.748 --> 00:04:59.849
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:05.989
I heard you had a hard time at the Jeju branch.

75
00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:07.223
Yes, I did.

76
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.727
I was scheming something as the princess of SC Food and Beverage.

77
00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:12.862
Scheme? What kind of scheme?

78
00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:15.732
Money.

79
00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:19.969
I will pretend to be a trustworthy chef to win my dad over.

80
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.938
Do you have to do that?

81
00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:25.542
You're his only daughter. SC Food and Beverage won't go anywhere.

82
00:05:26.476 --> 00:05:29.279
My great dad doesn't want me to be a nouveau riche.

83
00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:33.683
He will choose a successor based on competence, not blood.

84
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.853
You'll need my help then.

85
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.555
Princess.

86
00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:45.428
Nice to meet you.

87
00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.164
We've already seen each other, so let's skip the introduction.

88
00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.667
Let's work together in one accord,

89
00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:54.738
and write new history for SC Food and Beverage.

90
00:06:00.677 --> 00:06:02.746
I'll briefly announce the schedule.

91
00:06:02.746 --> 00:06:03.913
I have a question.

92
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.416
What is he doing here?

93
00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:11.221
Mr. Jung Tae Yang went through a special employment.

94
00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:14.290
He withdrew because of the company's fault.

95
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.593
We evaluated him separately and employed him.

96
00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:18.595
I'm obviously the manager, right?

97
00:06:18.595 --> 00:06:20.797
We can't have 2 chefs in 1 kitchen.

98
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.432
We already have a manager.

99
00:06:27.837 --> 00:06:29.038
Hello, everyone.

100
00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:39.783
I'll be working with you in developing menu from today.

101
00:06:39.783 --> 00:06:41.351
I'm the Manager Joo Ae Ri.

102
00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.088
Joo Ae Ri?

103
00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:48.358
Hey!

104
00:06:51.594 --> 00:06:53.029
- That hurts. - What's wrong?

105
00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:58.301
I'll take this.

106
00:06:58.735 --> 00:07:00.170
What should we do?

107
00:07:01.237 --> 00:07:03.840
The winners are No Ji Shim, Kim Sung Tan,

108
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.308
Jung Tae Yang and Lee Ru Ri.

109
00:07:06.976 --> 00:07:08.244
(Lee Ru Ri)

110
00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:11.247
Lee Ru Ri?

111
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:22.759
Look who's here.

112
00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:28.498
I'll have to get rid of trash first.

113
00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:35.538
Who is Joo Ae Ri?

114
00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:38.341
She is the Chairman's adopted daughter.

115
00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:40.844
She's not his real daughter?

116
00:07:40.844 --> 00:07:43.480
She is the daughter of the helper who took care of Chairman's house...

117
00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:45.048
for a long time.

118
00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.484
They lived together for over 20 years.

119
00:07:47.784 --> 00:07:50.286
Chairman Kevin supported her like his daughter.

120
00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.789
Is she a hidden child of his?

121
00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:56.793
I have a bad feeling. Be precise and find out about it.

122
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.428
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:04.601
She's the one who ruined my engagement.

124
00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:06.970
I don't want to see her at work, so fire her right away.

125
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.404
I'm going to point out two things.

126
00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:14.544
One more thing.

127
00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:17.347
If you want her out, beat her in the competition.

128
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.917
Only your skills will be considered here, not words.

129
00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:24.053
Okay.

130
00:08:24.487 --> 00:08:27.724
If that's your rule, I must obey it, Dad.

131
00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:40.637
Oh, no. What am I going to do?

132
00:08:40.637 --> 00:08:43.206
I told Mom that I got a job.

133
00:08:43.206 --> 00:08:44.874
I'm about to lose my job on my first day.

134
00:08:45.642 --> 00:08:47.210
This is so embarrassing.

135
00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:51.281
Why do only misfortunes happen to me?

136
00:08:57.053 --> 00:08:58.187
What are you doing?

137
00:08:58.655 --> 00:09:00.123
We need to get the training at the branches.

138
00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.758
That's not important right now.

139
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.526
I'll probably have to pack my things now...

140
00:09:03.526 --> 00:09:05.161
since Joo Ae Ri is the manager.

141
00:09:09.032 --> 00:09:10.433
You're scared of her that much?

142
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.436
Companies aren't playgrounds.

143
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.573
If she's going to kick you out because of her personal feeling,

144
00:09:17.373 --> 00:09:18.908
you should stay here at all cost.

145
00:09:18.942 --> 00:09:22.145
But she's the daughter of Chairman Kevin.

146
00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.880
This might sound like a cliche.

147
00:09:24.581 --> 00:09:26.416
The more iron gets hammered and dipped into the fire,

148
00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:28.918
the stronger and harder the iron becomes.

149
00:09:29.052 --> 00:09:30.820
Your true target...

150
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.389
isn't your environment. It's the kitchen.

151
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.792
"What can I do..."

152
00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:38.561
"to make the most delicious dish?"

153
00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.197
Come inside.

154
00:09:47.036 --> 00:09:50.073
He's right. I need to draw a line between my life and work.

155
00:09:50.773 --> 00:09:54.177
If something happens, I'll just take her down like in Guam.

156
00:09:55.578 --> 00:09:57.046
Wait for me, Chef Jung!

157
00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:11.928
Goodness, my back hurts. Shoot.

158
00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:31.280
- Hey, let's go. - Oh, my.

159
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.583
Don't go anywhere, and stay in the lobby.

160
00:10:33.583 --> 00:10:37.020
You should think about what you did wrong...

161
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.189
and repent all night long.

162
00:10:40.923 --> 00:10:43.793
Gosh, she can be so rigid.

163
00:10:43.793 --> 00:10:45.828
She must have slept in the lobby.

164
00:10:45.828 --> 00:10:48.264
She's going to catch a cold. Goodness.

165
00:10:53.503 --> 00:10:54.637
What is this?

166
00:10:55.038 --> 00:10:56.639
"Hotel Olivia"?

167
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.042
"350 dollars"?

168
00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:02.879
Wait. She wasn't reflecting on her wrongdoings last night.

169
00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:06.649
She was sleeping in a luxurious hotel, enjoying by herself?

170
00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:09.318
And she even stayed at a five-star hotel?

171
00:11:09.819 --> 00:11:12.822
Unbelievable. Has she lost her mind?

172
00:11:12.822 --> 00:11:14.023
Goodness.

173
00:11:17.527 --> 00:11:18.628
Where are you?

174
00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.764
Where do you think? I'm at my house.

175
00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:23.266
Your house?

176
00:11:28.004 --> 00:11:31.174
Hey, you. Where did you get all those clothes?

177
00:11:31.174 --> 00:11:34.677
From the look of it, I can tell that they are very expensive.

178
00:11:34.677 --> 00:11:37.213
I must say, you have good eyes.

179
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.416
I went shopping at the department store.

180
00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:41.784
I bought some clothes for myself and Ru Ri.

181
00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:44.420
Where is your card? Give it back to me.

182
00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:46.055
Goodness.

183
00:11:51.894 --> 00:11:53.796
I'm going to take this card away.

184
00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.766
Suit yourself. I already maxed out the card.

185
00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.800
Hey!

186
00:11:58.034 --> 00:11:59.135
What?

187
00:12:00.703 --> 00:12:02.939
Did you just yell at me?

188
00:12:02.939 --> 00:12:04.040
Yes, I did.

189
00:12:04.273 --> 00:12:07.009
I only realized it now after living 34 years with you.

190
00:12:07.043 --> 00:12:10.179
Others don't uphold my right. Only I can protect my own right.

191
00:12:10.546 --> 00:12:12.648
Starting now, don't you dare mistreat me.

192
00:12:12.648 --> 00:12:14.550
If you ever run your mouth at me,

193
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.185
yell at me, boss me around,

194
00:12:16.185 --> 00:12:18.287
make me kneel down, or kick me out of this house,

195
00:12:18.554 --> 00:12:20.456
that would be the last day of our marriage!

196
00:12:20.456 --> 00:12:23.960
From that moment, you will forever disappear in my life!

197
00:12:24.927 --> 00:12:28.264
Hey, when did I mistreat you?

198
00:12:28.264 --> 00:12:30.800
Besides, look who's talking.

199
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.535
You stabbed me in the back!

200
00:12:32.535 --> 00:12:34.637
How dare you go on a shopping spree?

201
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.206
- Did you earn this money? I did! - Goodness.

202
00:12:37.406 --> 00:12:39.041
All you talk about is money.

203
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:42.011
You brag that you supported our family whenever you have a chance.

204
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:45.581
For my entire life, I was worried about buying a T-shirt...

205
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:47.917
that only cost 10 dollars.

206
00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:50.686
I worked as a housewife who was never off the clock for 34 years.

207
00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:53.189
And I was a housewife to you without even getting paid.

208
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.958
I had to deal with your nagging when I wanted to buy my friend lunch.

209
00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.693
Without my sacrifices,

210
00:12:57.693 --> 00:12:59.529
do you think you could work hard at the company?

211
00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:01.898
What about the house? Do you think you'd be living here?

212
00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:04.333
You went golfing and on business trips.

213
00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:06.569
Only you got to enjoy those luxuries.

214
00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:09.138
I must start enjoying mine now. Got it?

215
00:13:09.138 --> 00:13:12.542
I'm going to spend the money I have saved up until now.

216
00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.076
Otherwise, it'd be a great injustice!

217
00:13:14.076 --> 00:13:17.814
Fine, fine. Use all of it. Spend all your money.

218
00:13:17.814 --> 00:13:20.316
Spend your money like water then.

219
00:13:20.316 --> 00:13:23.286
We don't have any income, but sure. Go ahead.

220
00:13:23.286 --> 00:13:24.821
I can just go into a mountain...

221
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:27.657
and live like a cave man!

222
00:13:27.824 --> 00:13:32.028
Hey, this is precisely why I can't let you handle our finances.

223
00:13:32.028 --> 00:13:34.197
You're not adequate enough to figure things out.

224
00:13:34.197 --> 00:13:36.499
Goodness, you're such an idiot.

225
00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:39.468
I warned you earlier. Don't you talk down to me.

226
00:13:39.468 --> 00:13:41.204
I'm returning your warning right back at you!

227
00:13:41.671 --> 00:13:43.806
A stupid daughter who takes after you.

228
00:13:43.806 --> 00:13:46.209
Thanks to me, her life was about to be taken care of.

229
00:13:46.209 --> 00:13:47.910
But you ruined it!

230
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.178
How will you take responsibility for it?

231
00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:53.049
Goodness. Is Oh Mok Sin really Prince Charming?

232
00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:55.418
Do you need to ask me that?

233
00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.321
He has a great family, went to good schools, and has a stable job.

234
00:13:58.321 --> 00:14:02.625
In this failing economy and with the high unemployment rate,

235
00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:06.696
a job at a public enterprise is a lifelong position!

236
00:14:06.796 --> 00:14:10.032
Where will Ru Ri meet someone as successful as him?

237
00:14:10.132 --> 00:14:12.935
I can't believe you. You're fooling yourself.

238
00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:15.938
I think he's the worst of the worst.

239
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:19.141
Seriously? How would you know that? Do you have proof?

240
00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:21.177
- You’re such an idiot. - Darn you.

241
00:14:22.645 --> 00:14:25.781
What a great timing. Here comes the proof.

242
00:14:26.916 --> 00:14:29.952
Proof? Goodness, whom is she trying to fool?

243
00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:32.688
Oh, my. How can she be so clueless?

244
00:14:36.692 --> 00:14:38.294
How have you been? Mr. Lee.

245
00:14:38.427 --> 00:14:42.064
Hey, you! Didn't I make myself clear?

246
00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:45.301
I told you not to set foot in my house!

247
00:14:46.869 --> 00:14:48.137
Call him, Myung Rang.

248
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.171
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.411
(My Honey Mok Sin)

250
00:14:55.778 --> 00:14:57.914
What are you scheming right now?

251
00:14:57.914 --> 00:14:58.948
Quiet.

252
00:15:00.416 --> 00:15:01.684
Goodness!

253
00:15:02.551 --> 00:15:04.053
Do you want to die, Small-eye?

254
00:15:04.186 --> 00:15:07.290
I told you not to show your face!

255
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.294
So that's why I’m only calling you.

256
00:15:11.794 --> 00:15:14.430
I'm really sorry about what happened.

257
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.765
Shut your mouth!

258
00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:20.169
Stop talking before I knock out those dirty teeth of yours.

259
00:15:21.037 --> 00:15:23.940
Oh, dear. You heard him, didn't you?

260
00:15:25.942 --> 00:15:27.276
Let me warn you.

261
00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:30.413
Tell Big-eye's dad to watch his back at night.

262
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.182
What? "My daughter is pretty"?

263
00:15:33.549 --> 00:15:35.084
Her face is a complete mess.

264
00:15:35.818 --> 00:15:39.622
Gosh, if she wasn't my father's friend's daughter...

265
00:15:40.056 --> 00:15:42.792
Anyhow, you wait.

266
00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:46.562
I have prepared a gift for you guys, ugly con-artists.

267
00:15:46.963 --> 00:15:48.197
Hang up!

268
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.199
(My Honey Mok Sin)

269
00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:55.671
Hey, how can he be so vulgar?

270
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:57.707
Gosh, what a jerk.

271
00:15:58.774 --> 00:16:01.043
How could he swear like that?

272
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.249
- I think he texted you. - Okay. Hold on.

273
00:16:07.783 --> 00:16:09.452
It's a video.

274
00:16:14.023 --> 00:16:15.624
Here's your gift.

275
00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:18.260
One.

276
00:16:20.162 --> 00:16:21.163
Two.

277
00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:25.034
Three. Here it comes!

278
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.307
Goodness, I can't believe this.

279
00:16:31.307 --> 00:16:34.677
What a piece of trash.

280
00:16:35.044 --> 00:16:37.013
Wait. So he really is...

281
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.049
Oh Mok Sin, son of Dong Ki?

282
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.687
If you don't think so, why don't you watch it again? Here.

283
00:16:44.687 --> 00:16:47.656
Hey, hey, hey. Get that out of my sight.

284
00:16:47.656 --> 00:16:49.058
It smells. Gosh, this is disgusting.

285
00:16:49.058 --> 00:16:50.659
Since we're at this,

286
00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:52.928
when we were going out, he never paid for a cup of coffee.

287
00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:55.531
He saved up the money and went to clubs to meet girls.

288
00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:57.199
- And... - Stop!

289
00:16:57.933 --> 00:17:00.636
That's enough. Let's stop it here.

290
00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.139
Do you see it now?

291
00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:07.176
Do you see how ridiculous your requests were?

292
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.045
She's right on this.

293
00:17:09.078 --> 00:17:11.447
Please give Ru Ri her freedom.

294
00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:13.349
There are tons of choices even for ice cream flavors these days,

295
00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:15.117
but she doesn't have any at all.

296
00:17:15.184 --> 00:17:16.986
She always has to listen to you.

297
00:17:17.186 --> 00:17:20.156
She even ran away to Guam because you suffocated her.

298
00:17:21.424 --> 00:17:24.960
Ru Ri has a job now.

299
00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:29.432
She's an intern, but she might get the job after six months.

300
00:17:29.432 --> 00:17:32.068
Just trust her this time.

301
00:17:33.969 --> 00:17:36.238
Goodness. Are you serious?

302
00:17:36.372 --> 00:17:39.875
I'll assure you that if you keep being stubborn like this,

303
00:17:40.376 --> 00:17:43.412
no one will remain by your side.

304
00:17:43.879 --> 00:17:46.649
You retired from work. Do you want to be left out in our family?

305
00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.385
Be quiet. Stop it.

306
00:17:50.019 --> 00:17:51.954
That's enough. Stop it.

307
00:17:52.188 --> 00:17:54.123
Stop it. Stop it!

308
00:18:08.604 --> 00:18:11.474
Honey, congratulations on our fourth wedding anniversary.

309
00:18:16.412 --> 00:18:19.682
He's gorgeous. He's a work of art. He's a fantastic piece of art.

310
00:18:28.324 --> 00:18:31.393
You said you didn't have to work in the morning. Did I wake you up?

311
00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:34.096
Can you take the suit I wore yesterday to the dry cleaners?

312
00:18:34.663 --> 00:18:35.731
Okay.

313
00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:43.873
What is this?

314
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:49.612
Beppu hot springs plane ticket?

315
00:18:50.679 --> 00:18:51.747
Honey.

316
00:18:57.586 --> 00:18:59.922
Let's go to Kyushu on the weekend with your mother.

317
00:19:00.322 --> 00:19:03.626
It's our anniversary. Let's go to the hot spring and eat sashimi.

318
00:19:05.828 --> 00:19:06.962
What's wrong?

319
00:19:07.263 --> 00:19:08.731
I'm so thankful.

320
00:19:09.365 --> 00:19:11.934
It's the first time you remembered our anniversary.

321
00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:15.337
I told you that I'd try harder.

322
00:19:16.238 --> 00:19:19.441
Don't be stressed that we're having a hard time conceiving a baby.

323
00:19:19.675 --> 00:19:22.311
We can live with or without a baby.

324
00:19:22.778 --> 00:19:24.713
- Okay? - Okay.

325
00:19:25.181 --> 00:19:27.383
I'll change a lot too.

326
00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.352
I'll reduce shopping and sleeping.

327
00:19:30.352 --> 00:19:32.855
I'll learn how to cook instead of going clubbing.

328
00:19:33.189 --> 00:19:35.958
Anyway, I love you so much.

329
00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:41.463
Wait a minute.

330
00:19:46.202 --> 00:19:47.269
Yes?

331
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:50.206
What?

332
00:19:52.575 --> 00:19:54.243
Okay, I'll be there right away.

333
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.751
Did you need me?

334
00:20:03.686 --> 00:20:05.321
Are you Doctor Lee So Won?

335
00:20:05.321 --> 00:20:07.489
Yes, is there a problem?

336
00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:11.560
A child was abandoned, so we just protected and treated the child.

337
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.430
We were going to take Han Gyul to the child protection center,

338
00:20:14.863 --> 00:20:17.633
but she said something strange, so we called you to check.

339
00:20:18.734 --> 00:20:20.002
Something strange?

340
00:20:21.136 --> 00:20:24.773
Han Gyul, can you repeat what you said a minute ago?

341
00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:26.842
Who is he?

342
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.085
It's okay, say it.

343
00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:37.753
Who am I to you?

344
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:43.859
Dad.

345
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.562
My dad.

346
00:20:47.396 --> 00:20:51.166
That's right, he's my dad.

347
00:20:51.567 --> 00:20:54.003
He's my dad.

348
00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:55.471
It's okay.

349
00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:00.676
She had this as proof.

350
00:21:05.414 --> 00:21:06.749
Han Gyul, it's okay.

351
00:21:16.258 --> 00:21:19.428
The food doesn't taste good.

352
00:21:19.762 --> 00:21:21.830
It's not like I have morning sickness.

353
00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:26.502
I will feel better after I eat...

354
00:21:26.502 --> 00:21:30.906
udon in a 100-year-old restaurant in Japan.

355
00:21:33.175 --> 00:21:34.576
What is this?

356
00:21:35.911 --> 00:21:40.683
Are these plane tickets for a Japanese hot spring?

357
00:21:42.351 --> 00:21:44.453
So Won wants to take us to Japan for the weekend.

358
00:21:44.453 --> 00:21:47.756
Oh, my. I can't believe this.

359
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.659
How did a cold man like him think of something like that?

360
00:21:50.659 --> 00:21:53.329
Be nice to him from now on.

361
00:21:53.429 --> 00:21:56.165
A country girl like you is...

362
00:21:56.165 --> 00:21:59.168
going to Japan all because of your wonderful doctor son-in-law.

363
00:21:59.168 --> 00:22:00.936
Your life is a success.

364
00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:06.375
If I were you, I would give him the building in Cheongdam-dong.

365
00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:08.877
What? Are you going to make me poor?

366
00:22:08.877 --> 00:22:11.313
That's not what I mean.

367
00:22:11.313 --> 00:22:14.683
I want to give him that as a thank you gift,

368
00:22:14.683 --> 00:22:17.152
since he loves me so much.

369
00:22:17.453 --> 00:22:19.922
You're an idiot.

370
00:22:19.988 --> 00:22:22.925
You're blaming the wrong thing and being ridiculous.

371
00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:25.394
It's not like you weren't loved because you were poor.

372
00:22:25.494 --> 00:22:27.129
You just lacked in techniques.

373
00:22:27.363 --> 00:22:28.664
Techniques?

374
00:22:28.664 --> 00:22:30.366
Three-cushion.

375
00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:33.168
Have you ever played three-cushion billiards?

376
00:22:34.403 --> 00:22:36.739
If you really love your husband,

377
00:22:36.739 --> 00:22:39.908
you need to do your best to your in-laws.

378
00:22:39.908 --> 00:22:41.477
That's the three-cushion technique.

379
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.879
You lost your child,

380
00:22:43.879 --> 00:22:46.815
so your father-in-law must be really upset.

381
00:22:47.249 --> 00:22:51.420
Should I do something for your in-laws?

382
00:22:51.687 --> 00:22:53.422
Three-cushion?

383
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.427
Inmate 601's visitor, please wait a minute.

384
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:16.912
That's right, he's my dad.

385
00:23:17.112 --> 00:23:19.448
He's my dad.

386
00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:28.123
I can't believe this.

387
00:23:31.126 --> 00:23:33.429
I'll assure you that if you keep being stubborn like this,

388
00:23:33.429 --> 00:23:36.432
no one will remain by your side.

389
00:23:36.432 --> 00:23:39.268
You retired from work. Do you want to be left out in our family?

390
00:23:40.469 --> 00:23:41.703
Stubborn?

391
00:23:42.538 --> 00:23:46.341
She's disregarding me because I'm retired.

392
00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:49.111
She defies me and talks back to me every time.

393
00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:52.147
Gosh, she's acting up.

394
00:23:56.518 --> 00:23:57.886
Be quiet!

395
00:24:03.826 --> 00:24:07.162
You dirty punk. Let it go.

396
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.431
- Give me one bite. - No.

397
00:24:11.166 --> 00:24:12.835
You're eating it all up.

398
00:24:12.935 --> 00:24:14.169
What is this?

399
00:24:14.403 --> 00:24:15.938
It doesn't taste good.

400
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:22.411
You're nothing without your wife at this age.

401
00:24:23.912 --> 00:24:25.647
His wife graduated their marriage,

402
00:24:25.647 --> 00:24:27.416
so he died alone.

403
00:24:27.416 --> 00:24:28.650
Did he die alone?

404
00:24:40.128 --> 00:24:42.164
No, that can't happen.

405
00:24:42.498 --> 00:24:43.565
That won't happen to me.

406
00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:46.368
No, that won't happen to me.

407
00:24:47.002 --> 00:24:49.638
No. No, no.

408
00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:51.173
That won't happen to me.

409
00:24:58.413 --> 00:24:59.481
Oh, my.

410
00:25:02.518 --> 00:25:03.585
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

411
00:25:04.653 --> 00:25:07.189
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

412
00:25:07.623 --> 00:25:08.724
What should we do?

413
00:25:09.658 --> 00:25:11.226
- Call an ambulance. - Okay, ma'am.

414
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.196
- Goodness! Father. - Oh, my.

415
00:25:14.196 --> 00:25:15.931
Oh, my. It really is him.

416
00:25:16.331 --> 00:25:19.701
I can't smell any alcohol. Why would he run into a car?

417
00:25:20.502 --> 00:25:22.404
What's wrong with him? What is he doing?

418
00:25:22.404 --> 00:25:23.739
- We're in trouble. - He needs to go to the hospital.

419
00:25:23.739 --> 00:25:26.408
When will it come? In two minutes?

420
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:29.878
670, 680, 690.

421
00:25:30.178 --> 00:25:31.413
It's 690 dollars.

422
00:25:33.582 --> 00:25:36.518
- This is 10 dollars. - That makes it 700 dollars.

423
00:25:37.219 --> 00:25:38.687
We need 800 more dollars.

424
00:25:38.687 --> 00:25:40.656
Why does a hairdressing school cost so much?

425
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.926
I wish we could hit the jackpot.

426
00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:45.727
Where will I get 800 dollars?

427
00:25:46.361 --> 00:25:47.563
Get a part-time job at a fast food restaurant.

428
00:25:48.931 --> 00:25:50.299
I want to,

429
00:25:52.334 --> 00:25:53.635
but they want me to get this form signed.

430
00:25:56.104 --> 00:25:57.973
Guardian consent for a part-time job?

431
00:25:58.907 --> 00:26:00.676
You need mom and dad's signatures.

432
00:26:01.343 --> 00:26:02.678
How will I get those?

433
00:26:02.878 --> 00:26:04.813
Mom will faint if I go to hairdressing school...

434
00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:06.048
instead of college.

435
00:26:06.114 --> 00:26:08.417
There's one way left.

436
00:26:18.594 --> 00:26:19.828
Do you know where their seals are?

437
00:26:31.773 --> 00:26:33.408
This is pretty.

438
00:26:37.946 --> 00:26:39.681
Do you know this person?

439
00:26:45.921 --> 00:26:48.657
That surprised me. I thought it was Tae Yang.

440
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.960
Is this his biological father?

441
00:26:56.732 --> 00:26:59.668
- Mom. - Who is he?

442
00:26:59.668 --> 00:27:01.003
He really looks like Tae Yang.

443
00:27:01.003 --> 00:27:02.404
Is he the biological father of Tae Yang?

444
00:27:02.671 --> 00:27:05.874
Get out. You're not supposed to touch my things.

445
00:27:06.575 --> 00:27:07.643
Mom.

446
00:27:07.643 --> 00:27:08.910
Get out right now!

447
00:27:22.124 --> 00:27:24.426
There's no such thing as a secret in the world.

448
00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:52.320
It must have been Anna.

449
00:27:53.622 --> 00:27:57.325
But she is supposed to be dead. And she can't be in Seoul.

450
00:27:59.528 --> 00:28:01.730
No, I must have been mistaken.

451
00:28:01.863 --> 00:28:03.098
It can't have been her.

452
00:28:03.398 --> 00:28:05.100
It's been 30 years.

453
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:09.698
It's pretty.

454
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.996
(Break Time from 3pm to 4pm)

455
00:30:47.996 --> 00:30:49.698
- Customer based service, - Customer based service,

456
00:30:49.698 --> 00:30:51.199
- customer satisfying service, - customer satisfying service,

457
00:30:51.199 --> 00:30:52.934
- and customer safety service. - and customer safety service.

458
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:55.003
I'll check the standard terms. Let's start with Chef No.

459
00:30:55.003 --> 00:30:57.038
Hello. Welcome.

460
00:30:57.239 --> 00:31:00.108
May I have your name?

461
00:31:00.308 --> 00:31:02.644
Did you make an appointment for three?

462
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:04.613
Sir, there are no more vacant seats.

463
00:31:04.613 --> 00:31:07.415
You may need to wait for 10 more minutes. Would that be all right?

464
00:31:09.217 --> 00:31:10.418
Well done.

465
00:31:10.418 --> 00:31:13.188
It will be dinner time within five minutes. Let's get ready.

466
00:31:13.388 --> 00:31:14.823
Manager Joo,

467
00:31:15.991 --> 00:31:18.126
- how about me? - Right.

468
00:31:18.927 --> 00:31:20.395
I forgot about the intern.

469
00:31:21.162 --> 00:31:23.932
You don't have any experience working in the restaurant.

470
00:31:24.666 --> 00:31:26.101
You should stay in the back.

471
00:31:29.371 --> 00:31:31.239
Gosh, that can't be true.

472
00:31:31.239 --> 00:31:32.574
Did you hear that, Manager Jung?

473
00:31:32.574 --> 00:31:33.909
Intern Lee Ru Ri,

474
00:31:34.009 --> 00:31:35.977
if you call me Manager, it could be confusing.

475
00:31:36.611 --> 00:31:38.313
From now on, call me Chef Jung.

476
00:31:52.427 --> 00:31:53.728
Excuse me, Manager Joo.

477
00:31:54.129 --> 00:31:57.599
I entered the company after I took the same exam as the others.

478
00:31:57.599 --> 00:31:59.968
I also participated actively in the courses this morning.

479
00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:03.838
I don't think it's fair that you don't treat me like the others.

480
00:32:03.838 --> 00:32:04.873
Really?

481
00:32:05.073 --> 00:32:07.876
I was only trying to be considerate. You must be confident.

482
00:32:08.944 --> 00:32:10.078
All right.

483
00:32:13.481 --> 00:32:14.516
But...

484
00:32:14.883 --> 00:32:17.686
if you make a mistake, I'll have you stay in the back.

485
00:32:29.597 --> 00:32:32.500
All right. I will do my best.

486
00:32:52.587 --> 00:32:53.888
It smells nice.

487
00:32:54.189 --> 00:32:55.757
You must have done something wrong.

488
00:32:56.257 --> 00:32:58.626
When you make mistakes, you can't look me in the eyes.

489
00:32:58.626 --> 00:33:00.328
You apologize to my back.

490
00:33:00.462 --> 00:33:02.130
Didn't the children say anything?

491
00:33:03.365 --> 00:33:04.833
They are really worried.

492
00:33:04.833 --> 00:33:06.768
They think you are having menopause.

493
00:33:07.268 --> 00:33:09.571
They said they are irritated because you are always irritated.

494
00:33:15.677 --> 00:33:17.712
How about you throw away...

495
00:33:18.346 --> 00:33:19.481
that necklace?

496
00:33:20.882 --> 00:33:23.218
Honestly, I'm jealous.

497
00:33:23.618 --> 00:33:25.687
I'm worried that you still have feelings for...

498
00:33:25.987 --> 00:33:28.523
Tae Yang's father because you still have the necklace.

499
00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:31.192
It's nothing like that.

500
00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:35.897
But I plan to tell Tae Yang everything...

501
00:33:36.297 --> 00:33:38.233
about his biological father.

502
00:33:38.233 --> 00:33:39.401
To do that...

503
00:33:39.467 --> 00:33:42.337
Right. He doesn't even know what his father looks like.

504
00:33:43.104 --> 00:33:44.572
When are you going to tell him?

505
00:33:44.739 --> 00:33:48.076
I'll tell him when he finds someone that he truly loves,

506
00:33:48.476 --> 00:33:50.779
and when he settles down,

507
00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:55.183
so that even if he hears something shocking like this,

508
00:33:55.884 --> 00:33:57.685
he would be all right.

509
00:33:59.087 --> 00:34:02.023
That's why you allowed him to work at SC Food and Beverage.

510
00:34:04.492 --> 00:34:06.428
I pray every day that...

511
00:34:06.728 --> 00:34:09.130
he would be able to endure it...

512
00:34:09.431 --> 00:34:11.766
even when your mother bullies him.

513
00:34:13.068 --> 00:34:15.003
He'll be great. Trust him.

514
00:34:15.103 --> 00:34:17.172
He's a lot like me.

515
00:34:17.172 --> 00:34:19.641
He is resilient.

516
00:34:27.849 --> 00:34:28.917
Chairman Kevin.

517
00:34:30.718 --> 00:34:31.786
Did you ask to see me?

518
00:34:33.421 --> 00:34:36.291
Can I check the security footage of the parking lot?

519
00:34:36.558 --> 00:34:38.560
I need to check the visitors' car plates.

520
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.464
Is it because of the person you met this morning?

521
00:34:42.964 --> 00:34:44.833
She was supposed to have died 30 years ago.

522
00:34:44.866 --> 00:34:46.868
I can't believe she's alive.

523
00:34:47.569 --> 00:34:49.437
I need to find out if she's alive...

524
00:34:50.038 --> 00:34:52.440
and the reason she came here.

525
00:34:56.644 --> 00:34:59.247
Here's your bacon carbonara pasta.

526
00:34:59.314 --> 00:35:00.348
Enjoy your meal.

527
00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:02.817
The plates are too heavy.

528
00:35:05.253 --> 00:35:07.288
This is today's special.

529
00:35:07.288 --> 00:35:10.391
This is soft meat harmonized with peanut dressing...

530
00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:20.068
Is there a problem, sir?

531
00:35:25.773 --> 00:35:27.008
What is that?

532
00:35:27.008 --> 00:35:28.042
It's hair.

533
00:35:28.042 --> 00:35:30.378
I have eyes. Don't act up.

534
00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:33.648
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

535
00:35:33.748 --> 00:35:35.583
I'll check with the kitchen and...

536
00:35:35.583 --> 00:35:36.584
Manager.

537
00:35:40.288 --> 00:35:42.457
Is there a problem, sir?

538
00:35:44.359 --> 00:35:46.161
How do you train your staff?

539
00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:47.962
This should...

540
00:35:48.563 --> 00:35:50.298
go back to where it belongs.

541
00:35:58.540 --> 00:35:59.941
I'm so sorry, sir.

542
00:36:11.252 --> 00:36:12.620
You can't deny that the color...

543
00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.422
and the length of this hair matches that of yours.

544
00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:16.024
I'm sorry. I will never...

545
00:36:16.024 --> 00:36:18.193
You have no sense of hygiene nor have you satisfied the customer.

546
00:36:18.693 --> 00:36:20.695
You should stay in the back.

547
00:36:36.411 --> 00:36:37.579
I'm so sorry.

548
00:36:56.064 --> 00:36:57.165
Did you like that?

549
00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:58.967
Well done.

550
00:37:00.068 --> 00:37:02.370
I'll make her leave on her own accord,

551
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.939
not even within six months, but a week.

552
00:37:20.788 --> 00:37:23.458
Honey. Wake up.

553
00:37:27.228 --> 00:37:29.897
Honey. Are you awake now?

554
00:37:31.199 --> 00:37:32.867
I'm sorry.

555
00:37:33.568 --> 00:37:36.437
I complained to you so much when you didn't do anything.

556
00:37:36.437 --> 00:37:38.206
I'll never do that again.

557
00:37:39.941 --> 00:37:41.442
How can I trust you?

558
00:37:41.643 --> 00:37:43.044
I swear.

559
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:47.482
I regretted so much when you were away because I was so lonely.

560
00:37:48.016 --> 00:37:52.854
Then sign it to prove it.

561
00:37:54.489 --> 00:37:55.957
Honey.

562
00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:00.928
Or I'm going to explode all of my brain blood vessels and kill myself.

563
00:38:01.129 --> 00:38:03.197
Honey. No.

564
00:38:03.464 --> 00:38:05.967
I can't live without you.

565
00:38:06.234 --> 00:38:08.503
Then sign it.

566
00:38:09.637 --> 00:38:10.772
Fine.

567
00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:29.123
Mom. Look at Father's lips.

568
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:30.525
Why are they like that?

569
00:38:31.192 --> 00:38:32.660
My goodness.

570
00:38:33.394 --> 00:38:35.697
He's got it.

571
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.465
Got what?

572
00:38:37.598 --> 00:38:40.168
Facial paralysis.

573
00:38:40.668 --> 00:38:43.638
- Facial paralysis? - Paralysis.

574
00:38:45.506 --> 00:38:47.208
Father. Wake up.

575
00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:49.077
Father. No. Wake up.

576
00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:50.778
- Wake up. Father. - What?

577
00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.317
- What's wrong? - What a relief.

578
00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:59.287
Because Yeon Ju woke you up,

579
00:38:59.287 --> 00:39:03.157
you were able to prevent paralyzing.

580
00:39:03.157 --> 00:39:04.192
What?

581
00:39:05.226 --> 00:39:08.162
How did I get here?

582
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:10.598
Goodness. Don't you remember?

583
00:39:11.232 --> 00:39:13.468
You were hit by my mom's car.

584
00:39:13.468 --> 00:39:15.503
On our way to your house,

585
00:39:15.503 --> 00:39:19.207
some man suddenly ran into my car.

586
00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:21.943
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you.

587
00:39:21.943 --> 00:39:24.846
You ran into my car...

588
00:39:24.846 --> 00:39:27.915
and fell backward. My goodness.

589
00:39:28.116 --> 00:39:32.086
I think it's serious because your brain was injured.

590
00:39:32.387 --> 00:39:36.524
Do you recognize me?

591
00:39:41.396 --> 00:39:43.231
Why did you save me?

592
00:39:44.232 --> 00:39:47.235
You should've left me to die on the street.

593
00:39:47.602 --> 00:39:49.103
No way.

594
00:39:49.103 --> 00:39:51.339
Why would you say that?

595
00:39:51.339 --> 00:39:56.210
If I collapsed again, I'm sure it means the stroke's back.

596
00:39:57.044 --> 00:39:58.913
I'd rather...

597
00:39:59.914 --> 00:40:02.483
Your result's not out yet,

598
00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:05.019
so don't give up yet.

599
00:40:05.686 --> 00:40:07.922
- Mr. Lee Shin Mo? - Yes. Hello.

600
00:40:09.023 --> 00:40:10.691
How's the result, Doctor?

601
00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:12.927
Father's test result. Hurry.

602
00:40:13.561 --> 00:40:17.198
Since my mouth is fine,

603
00:40:18.266 --> 00:40:19.867
that means my legs are paralyzed, am I right?

604
00:40:20.368 --> 00:40:22.937
- What did you eat yesterday? - Pardon me?

605
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.541
Yesterday,

606
00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:29.444
my daughter pissed me,

607
00:40:30.077 --> 00:40:33.815
so all I had was three bottles of soju.

608
00:40:33.815 --> 00:40:35.416
- Goodness. - And today?

609
00:40:35.917 --> 00:40:37.018
Today,

610
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.022
my wife pissed me.

611
00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:45.293
That reminds me I haven't had anything.

612
00:40:45.293 --> 00:40:46.961
That's why you fainted.

613
00:40:47.228 --> 00:40:50.064
You drank on an empty stomach, and you were stressed.

614
00:40:50.832 --> 00:40:53.868
It's only a temporary dizziness. Make sure to eat well.

615
00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:55.336
You can go home now.

616
00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:03.311
She told you to leave right now.

617
00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:05.980
You didn't tell my family, did you?

618
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.116
Of course. You yelled so loudly...

619
00:41:09.116 --> 00:41:11.619
when you were being transferred to the hospital.

620
00:41:12.253 --> 00:41:14.589
You told me never to tell Mother.

621
00:41:15.623 --> 00:41:16.757
Okay.

622
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:19.927
Take your mother home.

623
00:41:21.329 --> 00:41:25.233
I'm going to sleep here alone tonight.

624
00:41:30.271 --> 00:41:33.941
I'll book you a five-star hotel.

625
00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:35.576
You can sleep there.

626
00:41:41.682 --> 00:41:43.684
Inmate 601's visitor?

627
00:41:44.218 --> 00:41:45.186
Yes.

628
00:41:45.186 --> 00:41:46.287
Come this way.

629
00:42:18.886 --> 00:42:20.121
Long time no see.

630
00:42:28.396 --> 00:42:31.499
Mr. Lee. Get up, and try this.

631
00:42:31.766 --> 00:42:34.235
You drank soju on an empty stomach...

632
00:42:34.235 --> 00:42:36.504
since yesterday and had nothing.

633
00:42:36.504 --> 00:42:40.107
You should fill up your stomach before you sleep.

634
00:42:41.709 --> 00:42:43.711
Why didn't you leave?

635
00:42:43.878 --> 00:42:46.747
I bought this from a very famous restaurant,

636
00:42:46.847 --> 00:42:50.017
so try the soup first.

637
00:43:00.328 --> 00:43:02.930
I'm so sorry.

638
00:43:04.498 --> 00:43:06.000
Goodness.

639
00:43:06.767 --> 00:43:09.036
You must be very upset.

640
00:43:09.036 --> 00:43:11.439
You're crying in front of me.

641
00:43:11.639 --> 00:43:14.508
Just tell me.

642
00:43:14.609 --> 00:43:17.311
Pretend that I'm your sister.

643
00:43:18.212 --> 00:43:20.915
I've wasted my life.

644
00:43:22.617 --> 00:43:24.018
I never told you,

645
00:43:25.252 --> 00:43:28.022
but my heart hurts so much.

646
00:43:29.056 --> 00:43:33.194
Other people think I'm rich and that I enjoy my life with the money,

647
00:43:34.295 --> 00:43:38.265
but I actually got fired.

648
00:43:40.468 --> 00:43:41.936
I was planning to...

649
00:43:42.436 --> 00:43:46.407
go to a civil engineering cooperative company after I retire,

650
00:43:47.642 --> 00:43:49.577
but they rejected me.

651
00:43:50.978 --> 00:43:54.949
It deeply hurt your pride.

652
00:43:56.117 --> 00:43:58.786
I have nothing left, do I?

653
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.889
My children are grown up. They can go their own way.

654
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.959
I only have my wife left...

655
00:44:05.393 --> 00:44:08.562
at this old age.

656
00:44:09.163 --> 00:44:14.001
But she doesn't care about me.

657
00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:17.605
I have no idea what I did wrong.

658
00:44:17.772 --> 00:44:21.642
Do you want me to tell you what you did wrong?

659
00:44:24.712 --> 00:44:28.749
You only worked for all your life. That's what's wrong.

660
00:44:29.483 --> 00:44:31.352
You only worked hard.

661
00:44:31.786 --> 00:44:33.287
Worked hard?

662
00:44:33.621 --> 00:44:37.792
Yes. From now on, you must take care of people.

663
00:44:37.892 --> 00:44:39.827
Even though I'm a woman,

664
00:44:39.827 --> 00:44:42.329
women's hearts are so sly that we change our minds every minute.

665
00:44:42.329 --> 00:44:46.767
So you must always tell your wife, "I love you", "You're beautiful".

666
00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:48.602
Even if you didn't do anything wrong,

667
00:44:48.602 --> 00:44:50.938
tell her you're sorry and that it's your fault.

668
00:44:50.938 --> 00:44:52.440
You must give in to her.

669
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.809
Losing is winning.

670
00:44:54.809 --> 00:44:57.812
The beautiful secret is the love.

671
00:44:57.945 --> 00:45:00.081
Get it? Do you understand?

672
00:45:00.448 --> 00:45:01.549
Always.

673
00:45:04.018 --> 00:45:05.119
Father.

674
00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:06.620
Yes.

675
00:45:07.421 --> 00:45:08.889
Here's your present.

676
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:12.460
Give this to Mother. Here.

677
00:45:14.562 --> 00:45:17.565
They are real 50 dollar bills. All of them.

678
00:45:18.599 --> 00:45:19.734
My goodness.

679
00:45:24.772 --> 00:45:26.040
Nice to see you.

680
00:45:26.874 --> 00:45:28.442
It's been six years.

681
00:45:29.577 --> 00:45:31.712
- How... - What are you trying to do?

682
00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:35.249
Don't be so mean. We just reunited.

683
00:45:35.249 --> 00:45:36.350
Tell me.

684
00:45:38.586 --> 00:45:39.787
That kid, Han Gyul.

685
00:45:41.088 --> 00:45:42.189
Who's she?

686
00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:43.758
Why would you ask when you know the answer already?

687
00:45:46.393 --> 00:45:47.661
Then is it true?

688
00:45:49.597 --> 00:45:51.766
- Is she really... - If you can't trust me,

689
00:45:52.099 --> 00:45:55.169
ask your father. He knows everything.

690
00:45:55.369 --> 00:45:56.504
What do you mean?

691
00:45:57.605 --> 00:46:00.207
You moved to the US after marrying a rich man.

692
00:46:00.441 --> 00:46:02.143
Why would you blame my father?

693
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.349
You're so naive.

694
00:46:08.682 --> 00:46:10.251
Did you really trust what was written in that letter?

695
00:46:10.851 --> 00:46:13.020
Or are you pretending you did just to feel better?

696
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.523
- Jung Su Mi. - I left you...

697
00:46:15.956 --> 00:46:18.058
because of your father. Get it?

698
00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:19.560
What do you mean?

699
00:46:22.229 --> 00:46:23.831
What did he do to you?

700
00:46:23.831 --> 00:46:24.932
Do you want to see...

701
00:46:25.566 --> 00:46:29.136
what your father did to me?

702
00:46:58.432 --> 00:47:00.935
I'm glad I didn't marry Su Mi.

703
00:47:00.935 --> 00:47:03.871
Don't even bring her up.

704
00:47:04.538 --> 00:47:07.308
You'll never see her again in your life.

705
00:47:25.392 --> 00:47:26.894
Why isn't he picking up?

706
00:47:27.127 --> 00:47:29.964
What happened? He's not answering my calls.

707
00:47:44.812 --> 00:47:45.846
Honey.

708
00:47:46.847 --> 00:47:49.350
Why did you come out here to meet me?

709
00:47:50.351 --> 00:47:53.020
Were you worried that I'd have fainted?

710
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.388
Why didn't you answer my calls?

711
00:47:54.388 --> 00:47:56.190
I didn't have the energy to answer your calls.

712
00:47:57.024 --> 00:48:00.961
Gosh, you made me starve.

713
00:48:01.562 --> 00:48:02.963
Let's go inside.

714
00:48:02.963 --> 00:48:05.499
I cooked kimchi soup with pork neck that you like.

715
00:48:05.599 --> 00:48:06.867
Why are you doing this?

716
00:48:07.001 --> 00:48:09.169
You said you were going to isolate me.

717
00:48:09.169 --> 00:48:12.206
That will never work on you.

718
00:48:12.706 --> 00:48:14.141
Let's go inside.

719
00:48:14.942 --> 00:48:16.043
Here.

720
00:48:18.312 --> 00:48:19.747
I picked it up from the street.

721
00:48:20.748 --> 00:48:22.082
You can have that...

722
00:48:22.082 --> 00:48:24.351
and buy yourself some clothes.

723
00:48:28.756 --> 00:48:31.292
Gosh, I can't believe this.

724
00:48:31.792 --> 00:48:33.794
You are giving me money.

725
00:48:34.728 --> 00:48:37.097
If you do things you don't normally do, they say you'll die early.

726
00:48:37.231 --> 00:48:39.366
Gosh, Young Hye.

727
00:48:39.867 --> 00:48:42.736
- 1, 2... - What are you doing?

728
00:48:43.637 --> 00:48:44.772
Gosh.

729
00:48:44.872 --> 00:48:45.940
What are you doing?

730
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.808
Do you want to die?

731
00:48:55.749 --> 00:48:57.418
See, Young Hye?

732
00:48:58.185 --> 00:49:00.287
You can act up all right,

733
00:49:00.921 --> 00:49:02.856
but you are a grandmother now.

734
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:04.758
Gosh.

735
00:49:04.959 --> 00:49:07.962
So don't act up, okay?

736
00:49:08.295 --> 00:49:09.830
I won't act up either.

737
00:49:13.767 --> 00:49:14.768
Here.

738
00:49:15.636 --> 00:49:16.670
- Here. - No.

739
00:49:19.273 --> 00:49:20.307
Here.

740
00:49:31.018 --> 00:49:32.987
Oh, my.

741
00:49:40.894 --> 00:49:42.830
I pray every day that...

742
00:49:42.896 --> 00:49:45.332
he would be able to endure it...

743
00:49:45.599 --> 00:49:47.968
even when your mother bullies him.

744
00:49:54.308 --> 00:49:55.776
Who is this?

745
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.579
You came to see me without even calling me.

746
00:50:00.347 --> 00:50:01.849
I need to show you something.

747
00:50:15.229 --> 00:50:17.331
This is the only good memory...

748
00:50:17.331 --> 00:50:18.999
I have of you.

749
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.268
One week before you left the house,

750
00:50:22.236 --> 00:50:25.272
you spent the whole day playing with me and my brother.

751
00:50:25.773 --> 00:50:27.641
We didn't know anything.

752
00:50:28.042 --> 00:50:30.310
Excited by the attention our mother was giving us,

753
00:50:30.544 --> 00:50:33.947
we played until it got dark, not even realizing that we were hungry.

754
00:50:34.481 --> 00:50:36.016
Why did you...

755
00:50:37.418 --> 00:50:38.919
bring this to me?

756
00:50:39.353 --> 00:50:40.521
After that,

757
00:50:41.422 --> 00:50:43.357
I have never been happy.

758
00:50:44.558 --> 00:50:45.959
Do you know how...

759
00:50:45.959 --> 00:50:48.028
Eun Byul and I lived after my brother died?

760
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.098
Before she went to school,

761
00:50:51.698 --> 00:50:52.833
she'd...

762
00:50:54.435 --> 00:50:56.503
try to hide alcohol from me.

763
00:50:56.737 --> 00:50:58.705
Are you blaming me for that?

764
00:50:59.039 --> 00:51:01.909
That's when I met Hwa Young.

765
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:04.478
She saved me from alcohol...

766
00:51:04.978 --> 00:51:06.947
and provided a warm family for Eun Byul.

767
00:51:07.247 --> 00:51:10.484
Now, for the first time after that, I'm living like a human.

768
00:51:11.418 --> 00:51:12.419
So?

769
00:51:12.886 --> 00:51:14.521
I beg you.

770
00:51:15.522 --> 00:51:18.258
Please don't hurt my family.

771
00:51:18.358 --> 00:51:21.662
Leave my wife and Tae Yang alone.

772
00:51:21.662 --> 00:51:24.998
If I do that, what will you give me in return?

773
00:51:25.933 --> 00:51:27.101
I will...

774
00:51:28.469 --> 00:51:29.536
forgive you.

775
00:51:32.873 --> 00:51:34.708
I don't need your forgiveness.

776
00:51:35.375 --> 00:51:38.579
I've already forgiven myself.

777
00:51:39.446 --> 00:51:42.916
Go Jung Do, what I need is not my son...

778
00:51:43.016 --> 00:51:44.618
but a business partner who can make money with me.

779
00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:47.621
Come back after you make your decision.

780
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:23.123
What should I do?

781
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:25.259
Should I stop researching about Jung Hwa Young?

782
00:52:25.259 --> 00:52:26.660
Are you out of your mind?

783
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.462
Call Kim Jin Ho,

784
00:52:28.462 --> 00:52:30.397
and tell him that we have the money, and that we need to talk.

785
00:52:30.898 --> 00:52:31.965
Yes, ma'am.

786
00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:46.246
What on earth happened?

787
00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:48.682
- It's because of her. - No, it's not.

788
00:52:50.184 --> 00:52:52.252
Old habits die hard.

789
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.888
She's being mean here again.

790
00:53:07.067 --> 00:53:08.835
What are you doing? It smells.

791
00:53:08.835 --> 00:53:10.504
Clean the frying pan first.

792
00:53:11.538 --> 00:53:12.773
Yes, ma'am.

793
00:53:21.448 --> 00:53:23.750
You need to clean it thoroughly, Intern Lee.

794
00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:25.219
Good luck.

795
00:53:25.586 --> 00:53:27.020
I'm sorry I have to leave early.

796
00:53:31.758 --> 00:53:32.893
Do you have a lot to do?

797
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:36.597
I have so many left, Manager... I mean, Chef Jung.

798
00:53:36.964 --> 00:53:37.998
Really?

799
00:53:38.665 --> 00:53:40.334
You just have to try harder then.

800
00:53:40.601 --> 00:53:41.768
Goodbye, Intern Lee.

801
00:53:54.448 --> 00:53:55.482
Isn't it hard?

802
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.188
Then...

803
00:54:02.122 --> 00:54:03.257
just give up.

804
00:54:03.957 --> 00:54:06.293
The exit door is always open.

805
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.963
If you try to stay, you'll experience the abyss.

806
00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:14.001
Or is it the abyss already?

807
00:54:23.377 --> 00:54:26.046
Oh, my. My hand must have slipped.

808
00:54:53.206 --> 00:54:54.541
I have the security footage.

809
00:55:00.347 --> 00:55:01.348
Wait.

810
00:55:02.149 --> 00:55:03.250
Zoom in.

811
00:55:06.119 --> 00:55:07.921
Is that Anna?

812
00:55:08.855 --> 00:55:10.057
She looks similar.

813
00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:13.694
What's her car plate number?

814
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:19.466
Unfortunately, the security cameras are being replaced.

815
00:55:19.466 --> 00:55:21.168
This is all we have.

816
00:55:22.102 --> 00:55:26.039
51Ma 9378.

817
00:55:30.877 --> 00:55:32.212
Track the car.

818
00:55:32.846 --> 00:55:33.847
Yes, sir.

819
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.988
He's being so mean.

820
00:55:41.988 --> 00:55:44.691
I came here because of him, and yet he pretends like he doesn't know me.

821
00:55:44.958 --> 00:55:46.526
Now that he got in,

822
00:55:46.526 --> 00:55:48.528
he probably doesn't need a fool like me.

823
00:55:52.165 --> 00:55:54.267
Gosh, my legs hurt.

824
00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:56.002
Even my shoulders hurt.

825
00:55:58.772 --> 00:56:00.540
Gosh, my nails.

826
00:56:03.176 --> 00:56:04.177
I'm hungry.

827
00:56:05.579 --> 00:56:08.048
Are you hungry? Yes, I know.

828
00:56:08.348 --> 00:56:09.416
I'll go home...

829
00:56:09.416 --> 00:56:11.518
and feed you ramen. I understand.

830
00:56:11.518 --> 00:56:13.887
Ru Ri, are you done washing dishes?

831
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:18.058
From tomorrow, you should come here one hour earlier.

832
00:56:18.191 --> 00:56:20.660
If you can't work properly, you should at least be diligent.

833
00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:25.599
Aren't you hungry?

834
00:56:25.966 --> 00:56:27.868
I'll buy you ramen at a really good restaurant.

835
00:56:39.646 --> 00:56:42.048
You should come while my offer still stands.

836
00:56:42.048 --> 00:56:43.850
I know that your stomach is in war right now.

837
00:57:15.649 --> 00:57:16.850
Why do you keep...

838
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:30.497
Are you growing your nails?

839
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.734
Let's talk about it when we get off.

840
00:57:58.892 --> 00:58:01.695
Come an hour early, and wash the frying pans again,

841
00:58:01.895 --> 00:58:03.063
so it won't get smelly.

842
00:58:28.855 --> 00:58:29.956
Let me see.

843
00:58:44.604 --> 00:58:46.806
(Congratulations!)

844
00:58:49.709 --> 00:58:50.810
That's cute.

845
00:59:08.061 --> 00:59:10.463
(Queen of dish washing)

846
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:26.846
Honey. Honey.

847
00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:28.248
What?

848
00:59:28.682 --> 00:59:30.517
Get up, and drink this.

849
00:59:30.517 --> 00:59:31.618
Okay.

850
00:59:32.419 --> 00:59:35.121
My goodness. What's this?

851
00:59:45.465 --> 00:59:47.601
Why? Does it taste weird?

852
00:59:48.368 --> 00:59:50.637
You're beautiful. Really.

853
00:59:50.837 --> 00:59:52.138
Goodness.

854
00:59:52.138 --> 00:59:54.608
Get up. Get ready for breakfast.

855
00:59:55.375 --> 00:59:58.712
Wait. Sit here. Sit.

856
01:00:01.748 --> 01:00:06.119
I had a dream about you last night.

857
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.390
You said you'll never leave me, and you even kissed me.

858
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:13.693
It felt really good. What a dream.

859
01:00:14.728 --> 01:00:18.565
You snored so loud. I didn't know you had a dream.

860
01:00:18.732 --> 01:00:23.036
Hey. I wouldn't have such a dream if I wasn't so stressed.

861
01:00:23.937 --> 01:00:25.271
It's all your fault.

862
01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:33.413
So let's stop fighting. I beg you.

863
01:00:33.947 --> 01:00:37.250
I must be old. I don't even have the energy to cook after we fight.

864
01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:39.986
Fine. Okay. I get it.

865
01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.688
I said I'll be better,

866
01:00:43.189 --> 01:00:45.291
so...

867
01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.029
why don't you...

868
01:00:50.296 --> 01:00:52.232
kiss me here?

869
01:00:54.434 --> 01:00:55.602
Goodness.

870
01:00:56.269 --> 01:00:58.505
Fine. All right.

871
01:01:02.442 --> 01:01:05.045
My gosh. You're ridiculous.

872
01:01:05.278 --> 01:01:06.980
This is great.

873
01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:17.791
It's Yeon Ju.

874
01:01:19.059 --> 01:01:21.561
Yes. What's up so early in the morning?

875
01:01:23.496 --> 01:01:24.664
What?

876
01:01:25.331 --> 01:01:29.002
Okay. I see.

877
01:01:29.536 --> 01:01:32.038
Calm down. Hang up first.

878
01:01:32.038 --> 01:01:33.807
I'll find out. Okay.

879
01:01:36.376 --> 01:01:39.345
So Won didn't come home last night.

880
01:01:40.046 --> 01:01:42.849
What? That punk.

881
01:01:48.521 --> 01:01:49.622
Where are you?

882
01:01:51.524 --> 01:01:52.559
What?

883
01:01:56.229 --> 01:01:57.831
Okay. Bye.

884
01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.136
You said he got a studio apartment. Where is it?

885
01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.705
- I'll go with you. - No.

886
01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:08.508
He told me to come alone. He said he has something to tell me.

887
01:02:09.576 --> 01:02:11.177
That punk.

888
01:02:13.413 --> 01:02:15.715
What's going on?

889
01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:26.726
Yes. This is the one.

890
01:02:38.438 --> 01:02:42.442
Oh, my. I'm at the wrong place.

891
01:02:42.776 --> 01:02:43.877
I'm sorry.

892
01:02:46.246 --> 01:02:48.348
Father. Come in.

893
01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:56.389
Is this your apartment?

894
01:02:58.124 --> 01:02:59.959
Then who's this?

895
01:03:04.664 --> 01:03:07.267
Who is she? Why is she with you?

896
01:03:07.667 --> 01:03:08.835
Who's child is she?

897
01:03:09.502 --> 01:03:10.603
She's our child.

898
01:03:10.837 --> 01:03:13.373
What? What do you mean?

899
01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.641
She's...

900
01:03:16.943 --> 01:03:18.211
your granddaughter.
