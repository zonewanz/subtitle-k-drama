00:00:30.517 --> 00:00:33.620
(Episode 16)

2
00:00:43.897 --> 00:00:45.498
Do you want some help?

3
00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:50.537
Are you okay?

4
00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.289
Only public law shall be like water, and justice shall flow like sewage.

5
00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:12.258
Only public law shall be like water, and justice shall flow like sewage.

6
00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:37.317
And justice shall flow like sewage.

7
00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:59.439
This was his first murder in a public place.

8
00:02:00.707 --> 00:02:02.308
Did you get the security footage?

9
00:02:02.308 --> 00:02:04.077
We're checking them right now.

10
00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:06.379
But there weren't any near the back gate.

11
00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:08.348
And there was no one in the church?

12
00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:11.217
A woman said she saw a suspicious person.

13
00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:12.919
We are asking her some questions.

14
00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:15.688
Sun Woo and Min Young, you should go and listen.

15
00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:17.090
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.804
He's getting bolder.

17
00:02:35.775 --> 00:02:38.378
He doesn't seem to have been influenced by the situation.

18
00:02:41.114 --> 00:02:42.348
He's meticulous.

19
00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:45.318
He suggests his methods carefully...

20
00:02:45.418 --> 00:02:48.388
as if he thinks of it as important as the killing itself.

21
00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:57.297
The pool of blood is concentrated inside.

22
00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.267
He must have covered him with cloth after he killed him.

23
00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.338
I didn't see his face.

24
00:03:06.406 --> 00:03:09.209
He had a hood on.

25
00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:11.878
His head had been lowered too.

26
00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:14.447
What made him look suspicious?

27
00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:16.850
Something was off about him.

28
00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:21.588
I tried to talk to him as he was a stranger who had come late at night.

29
00:03:22.288 --> 00:03:24.057
But he just stayed there.

30
00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.428
I asked him if he was okay,

31
00:03:28.795 --> 00:03:31.097
but he just sat there.

32
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.534
Did he...

33
00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:37.704
show any reactions when you talked to him?

34
00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.074
That is...

35
00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:45.478
It didn't seem like he was praying,

36
00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.647
but he kept...

37
00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.519
moving his fingers.

38
00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:56.689
It looked like he was playing a piano.

39
00:04:00.627 --> 00:04:03.396
He could have killed me, right?

40
00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:04.964
Don't worry.

41
00:04:05.398 --> 00:04:08.635
The police will be protecting you for a while.

42
00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:10.637
Thank you.

43
00:04:11.337 --> 00:04:13.640
The culprit doesn't kill random people.

44
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.110
He's only interested in people that he has decided as a target.

45
00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:21.314
Yes. These victims must have been killed...

46
00:04:21.614 --> 00:04:23.049
because of a similarity they had.

47
00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:25.418
We need to find out what that is.

48
00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:27.353
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.494
Excuse me,

50
00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:37.764
but may I have a look at that?

51
00:04:47.607 --> 00:04:51.678
Team Manager Kang, I was researching the victims' past,

52
00:04:52.078 --> 00:04:54.514
and I found out that Father Han Sang Jin had been...

53
00:04:54.514 --> 00:04:57.317
charged with child molestation a year ago.

54
00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:59.285
Child molestation?

55
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.588
What happened?

56
00:05:02.355 --> 00:05:04.757
Many devotees started a petition campaign,

57
00:05:04.857 --> 00:05:06.626
and they submitted it to the court.

58
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.129
After that, the parents who had reported it dropped the charges,

59
00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:11.598
and he was found innocent.

60
00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:14.467
All right.

61
00:05:21.674 --> 00:05:24.277
I will go back into my office first.

62
00:05:24.577 --> 00:05:25.778
I need to check something.

63
00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:30.450
Go with Min Young.

64
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.517
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:32.018 --> 00:05:34.354
- Yes, Hyun Jun? - Nana.

66
00:05:34.954 --> 00:05:38.358
I want to know if other victims had been charged for something.

67
00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.159
It's urgent.

68
00:05:40.727 --> 00:05:43.496
In that case, I'll research as fast as I can.

69
00:05:45.698 --> 00:05:46.899
Okay.

70
00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:49.669
I will start with Kang Joon Seob.

71
00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:52.205
All right.

72
00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:56.075
February 2015, he was charged with dating violence,

73
00:05:56.075 --> 00:05:58.378
but he was found innocent.

74
00:05:59.646 --> 00:06:02.949
Han Ju Young worked at a daycare center six years ago...

75
00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.518
and was charged for assaulting a child which had resulted in death.

76
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.354
This isn't right.

77
00:06:08.688 --> 00:06:09.889
Was she acquitted?

78
00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.658
Wait... Wait.

79
00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:14.694
This is a different case.

80
00:06:15.128 --> 00:06:17.897
In 2013, she was charged with administration of...

81
00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:20.400
methamphetamine and ecstasy with her friends.

82
00:06:20.767 --> 00:06:24.704
She was sentenced to one year and a half of imprisonment...

83
00:06:24.704 --> 00:06:26.939
and three years of probation for violating the law on drugs.

84
00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:30.677
This might actually lead to something.

85
00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:37.150
Lee Hyun Jae, the taxi driver, was charged with drunk driving.

86
00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:39.185
And he was found innocent?

87
00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.354
Yes, that's right.

88
00:06:41.788 --> 00:06:45.258
He was found innocent during his trial four months ago.

89
00:06:46.225 --> 00:06:47.593
All right. Thank you.

90
00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:55.935
Team Manager Kang.

91
00:06:58.538 --> 00:07:00.873
The victims have all been charged with a serious murder...

92
00:07:00.973 --> 00:07:02.809
but have been found innocent.

93
00:07:03.109 --> 00:07:04.577
Now we know...

94
00:07:05.178 --> 00:07:07.513
the similarity that the victims had.

95
00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:18.558
He was after the people...

96
00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.194
who were found not guilty.

97
00:07:26.866 --> 00:07:28.434
He didn't just put any stone into the victim's ear.

98
00:07:28.434 --> 00:07:29.469
There is a pattern on it.

99
00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:30.536
A pattern?

100
00:07:31.838 --> 00:07:34.574
This is the pattern that was on the stone inside the victim's ear.

101
00:07:41.013 --> 00:07:42.448
This is a "baraegi" pattern...

102
00:07:42.448 --> 00:07:45.118
that was used to drive away evil spirits since Unified Silla.

103
00:07:45.818 --> 00:07:47.487
- Baraegi? - Yes.

104
00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:50.189
It's also referred to as "Yacha" or "goblin".

105
00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:51.257
I know this too.

106
00:07:51.424 --> 00:07:54.827
This is like a guardian that looks after the soul after death.

107
00:07:55.027 --> 00:07:58.965
Yes, it was normally used as a talisman.

108
00:07:59.398 --> 00:08:02.735
They put it on roof tiles and doorknobs of ancient monuments.

109
00:08:02.835 --> 00:08:05.838
It's still being used on modern buildings as well.

110
00:08:06.606 --> 00:08:08.608
That means that the culprit...

111
00:08:08.608 --> 00:08:11.144
considers the victims as evil that he needs to conquer.

112
00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:14.080
Yes.

113
00:08:15.047 --> 00:08:16.849
He planned every moment...

114
00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:19.318
of his murder carefully.

115
00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:23.089
The culprit attacks the victim at once with a knife.

116
00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:25.858
And then, he uses a blade to make sure they're dead.

117
00:08:25.858 --> 00:08:28.394
He also leaves a symbolic sign.

118
00:08:29.328 --> 00:08:32.265
Then, he covers the eyes of the victims.

119
00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:34.734
In cases like these,

120
00:08:34.734 --> 00:08:37.136
the culprit's emotions are excessively involved.

121
00:08:37.403 --> 00:08:40.206
They tend to express the belief that they believe in.

122
00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:43.109
That is why we need to focus on the fact that the culprit...

123
00:08:43.276 --> 00:08:46.946
covered the face of the victims as if they were Lady Justice.

124
00:08:47.046 --> 00:08:49.248
This is closely related...

125
00:08:49.248 --> 00:08:51.484
to his job.

126
00:08:51.617 --> 00:08:53.786
Lady Justice has its eyes covered...

127
00:08:53.786 --> 00:08:56.489
which signifies that the law will be enforced...

128
00:08:56.656 --> 00:08:59.425
regardless of social status and wealth.

129
00:09:00.326 --> 00:09:01.727
But unlike other countries,

130
00:09:01.727 --> 00:09:04.130
the Lady Justice in front of the Supreme Court in Korea...

131
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.464
doesn't have its eyes covered.

132
00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:06.599
(We Should Cover the Eyes of Lady Justice Right Now!)

133
00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:10.536
It seems like he's trying to express the unfairness...

134
00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:12.338
of the judicial system in Korea.

135
00:09:13.406 --> 00:09:17.009
The culprit, his family, or friends could have been a victim...

136
00:09:17.343 --> 00:09:19.879
of a serious crime.

137
00:09:22.048 --> 00:09:25.218
It's likely that the culprit is someone...

138
00:09:25.218 --> 00:09:29.055
working for or near the judicial system.

139
00:09:29.755 --> 00:09:32.959
Then we will cross reference the people working in the legal field...

140
00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:36.295
and the victims who have been involved in assault cases...

141
00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:38.497
in the past.

142
00:09:38.497 --> 00:09:42.568
Even if we were right and he is working in the legal field,

143
00:09:42.668 --> 00:09:45.438
he won't be noticeable.

144
00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:06.926
The culprit knows...

145
00:10:07.059 --> 00:10:10.396
that people don't really know who he is.

146
00:10:15.334 --> 00:10:18.304
His normal features are the best shields...

147
00:10:18.304 --> 00:10:20.339
that help him protect himself.

148
00:10:21.307 --> 00:10:23.776
If the information we have gathered goes public,

149
00:10:23.776 --> 00:10:25.778
the culprit will only gain more information.

150
00:10:26.078 --> 00:10:29.248
Please make sure none of this information leaks.

151
00:10:30.116 --> 00:10:31.617
We have to make sure...

152
00:10:31.784 --> 00:10:34.186
this doesn't go public through the media.

153
00:10:34.453 --> 00:10:36.689
If that happens, the culprit will...

154
00:10:36.856 --> 00:10:40.026
think that he has overpowered the people by himself.

155
00:10:40.026 --> 00:10:43.429
That confidence will only make him kill more.

156
00:11:04.884 --> 00:11:06.118
This is Yoo Min Young speaking.

157
00:11:09.055 --> 00:11:10.189
Okay.

158
00:11:13.893 --> 00:11:15.728
Why, did something happen?

159
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:18.898
The culprit killed another person again.

160
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:24.937
This is the fifth victim.

161
00:11:24.937 --> 00:11:28.307
It's a murder case from a year ago at a bus terminal.

162
00:11:28.674 --> 00:11:31.010
A police was murdered...

163
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.179
after getting in a quarrel...

164
00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:35.047
and a physical fight with a pedestrian.

165
00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:37.783
The attacker Oh Jin Myung was found not guilty,

166
00:11:37.883 --> 00:11:39.819
and he was released.

167
00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:41.087
(Official documents regarding Oh Jin Myung's case)

168
00:11:41.087 --> 00:11:43.956
There was a witness testifying...

169
00:11:43.956 --> 00:11:46.058
that Oh Jin Myung's behavior was completely accidental.

170
00:11:46.158 --> 00:11:47.159
Her name is Han Seo Ra.

171
00:11:47.827 --> 00:11:49.895
Because of her crucial testament,

172
00:11:49.895 --> 00:11:51.998
Oh Jin Myung was found not guilty.

173
00:11:54.767 --> 00:11:56.068
We will go and find out.

174
00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:58.337
- Please back us up. - Okay.

175
00:12:01.307 --> 00:12:02.708
You have to see this right now.

176
00:12:05.044 --> 00:12:08.914
Do you remember the murder of a taxi driver we reported yesterday?

177
00:12:08.914 --> 00:12:10.883
It has been revealed that this case...

178
00:12:10.883 --> 00:12:14.453
had a similar context as a vigilance murder...

179
00:12:14.453 --> 00:12:17.223
like the homemaker murder case that was reported a week ago...

180
00:12:17.223 --> 00:12:20.359
and the dentist murder case.

181
00:12:20.426 --> 00:12:22.695
It is interesting...

182
00:12:22.695 --> 00:12:24.997
that the victims all had court records...

183
00:12:24.997 --> 00:12:27.600
of past cases that caused public rage.

184
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.303
It was revealed that they openly enjoyed normal life...

185
00:12:31.303 --> 00:12:34.273
after they were all found not guilty...

186
00:12:34.273 --> 00:12:38.177
from committing a felony.

187
00:12:38.177 --> 00:12:40.479
People are saying the culprit is keeping justice for society...

188
00:12:40.479 --> 00:12:43.549
when the law isn't doing that.

189
00:12:44.517 --> 00:12:47.853
Every station is broadcasting this since the afternoon.

190
00:12:48.587 --> 00:12:50.389
The culprit isn't...

191
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.358
our only opponent now.

192
00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:55.094
We will go to Han Seo Ra right away.

193
00:12:58.864 --> 00:13:00.733
One day, heavy rain will fall...

194
00:13:00.733 --> 00:13:03.335
and all trash will be washed away.

195
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.505
This is a line from the movie "Taxi Driver".

196
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.674
People are even saying...

197
00:13:08.674 --> 00:13:12.178
that the police gave the culprit an inside list of suspects.

198
00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:14.447
Are you saying...

199
00:13:14.447 --> 00:13:16.449
that someone leaked criminal records to the media?

200
00:13:16.449 --> 00:13:20.086
We know for sure that someone is providing information to them.

201
00:13:20.086 --> 00:13:21.087
Whoever that is,

202
00:13:21.087 --> 00:13:24.557
that person must have free access to court records.

203
00:13:24.957 --> 00:13:28.127
Why aren't the culprits contacting the media?

204
00:13:28.127 --> 00:13:29.929
Culprits like this usually want...

205
00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:32.264
to be praised of their work.

206
00:13:32.598 --> 00:13:34.733
That might not be important to them right now.

207
00:13:34.967 --> 00:13:37.369
They are still executing their plan right now.

208
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.105
They are going crazy for this imaginary role...

209
00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:42.608
such as "judge of justice" and "cleaner of the streets"...

210
00:13:42.608 --> 00:13:46.145
that people are calling them.

211
00:13:47.713 --> 00:13:48.948
I will find some media records...

212
00:13:48.948 --> 00:13:52.184
of controversial cases that were ruled non-guilty.

213
00:13:52.284 --> 00:13:54.386
I might be able to point out victims...

214
00:13:54.386 --> 00:13:56.789
before the culprits do.

215
00:13:57.089 --> 00:13:59.658
Team Manager Kang, you need to see this first.

216
00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:03.429
About an hour ago, we started to receive calls regarding information.

217
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:05.197
It is more serious than we expected.

218
00:14:05.197 --> 00:14:06.799
I have some information.

219
00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:09.435
What should I do to give this information to the murderer?

220
00:14:09.435 --> 00:14:12.204
Why are the police trying so hard to catch someone like this?

221
00:14:12.204 --> 00:14:14.440
Are you jealous because they are more competent than you are?

222
00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:17.510
Help Min Young to find out...

223
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.079
who leaked the information to the media.

224
00:14:20.646 --> 00:14:24.350
Nana, please find out who released this first, and report right away.

225
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.518
Yes, sir.

226
00:14:38.197 --> 00:14:39.398
Thank you.

227
00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:41.433
Thank you.

228
00:14:42.535 --> 00:14:43.636
Thank you.

229
00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:02.047
Let me go.

230
00:16:02.047 --> 00:16:03.148
Are you okay?

231
00:16:03.148 --> 00:16:04.783
- Don't move. - Let go.

232
00:16:04.783 --> 00:16:05.784
Don't move!

233
00:16:06.318 --> 00:16:09.088
Let me go!

234
00:16:10.256 --> 00:16:12.258
Stop.

235
00:16:12.258 --> 00:16:14.226
Let me go.

236
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.894
No.

237
00:16:16.528 --> 00:16:18.797
Gong Hyung Kyu, 34 years old.

238
00:16:18.998 --> 00:16:21.567
He works as a private security guard at a bank.

239
00:16:22.868 --> 00:16:24.370
He was robbed last year,

240
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.639
so he received intensive care.

241
00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.707
I think he started acting strangely from that time.

242
00:16:28.707 --> 00:16:31.310
He fits our profile.

243
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.779
How is it going?

244
00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:35.848
He confessed every crime just now.

245
00:16:37.383 --> 00:16:40.119
Why did you kill...

246
00:16:40.119 --> 00:16:41.587
Han Seo Ra when she has no relation to you?

247
00:16:41.587 --> 00:16:44.423
She deserved to die.

248
00:16:44.423 --> 00:16:46.358
Why do you think so?

249
00:16:46.925 --> 00:16:48.994
She received money to testify.

250
00:16:48.994 --> 00:16:50.796
If she didn't do a dirty deed like that,

251
00:16:50.796 --> 00:16:52.564
that man who killed an innocent police...

252
00:16:53.165 --> 00:16:54.333
wouldn't have been released.

253
00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:57.536
It is not your position to decide.

254
00:16:58.337 --> 00:17:00.339
He lived a perfectly normal life...

255
00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:03.275
after committing an unforgivable crime...

256
00:17:04.076 --> 00:17:05.778
and even boasted about it like it was a heroic episode.

257
00:17:07.279 --> 00:17:08.414
This world is...

258
00:17:09.548 --> 00:17:11.717
full of people who deserve to die.

259
00:17:12.318 --> 00:17:13.986
If you don't demonstrate like this,

260
00:17:14.887 --> 00:17:17.189
people will suffer again one day.

261
00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:20.459
It sounds...

262
00:17:21.427 --> 00:17:24.730
like you are completely innocent.

263
00:17:25.297 --> 00:17:28.467
I did what I had to do. It was obvious.

264
00:17:30.235 --> 00:17:32.738
What did the taxi driver do wrong?

265
00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:35.808
He ruined a family.

266
00:17:36.008 --> 00:17:37.376
He was drinking and driving.

267
00:17:37.376 --> 00:17:38.777
What about Han Sang Jin?

268
00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:41.547
He's not even human.

269
00:17:41.947 --> 00:17:44.483
He violated children that were like his daughter.

270
00:17:45.317 --> 00:17:46.819
He used their religion as a bait.

271
00:17:47.219 --> 00:17:49.355
Is that why you stabbed his heart?

272
00:17:51.457 --> 00:17:53.158
I regret killing him so simply...

273
00:17:53.759 --> 00:17:56.095
when I think of those children.

274
00:17:56.628 --> 00:17:58.297
I should have ripped him into pieces...

275
00:17:59.298 --> 00:18:01.934
and choked him to give him pain.

276
00:18:01.934 --> 00:18:02.935
Stop.

277
00:18:06.338 --> 00:18:07.773
I'll leave him to you.

278
00:18:13.779 --> 00:18:14.847
Gong Hyung Kyu.

279
00:18:17.383 --> 00:18:19.218
Were you that desperate to become a star?

280
00:18:19.685 --> 00:18:20.753
Or...

281
00:18:21.186 --> 00:18:23.689
did you just kill everyone because this was the chance to do so?

282
00:18:24.556 --> 00:18:25.858
Come back to your senses.

283
00:18:26.358 --> 00:18:29.128
You're going to regret imitating them mindlessly.

284
00:18:31.363 --> 00:18:33.999
Every one of the people I killed...

285
00:18:34.199 --> 00:18:35.968
all deserved to die.

286
00:18:36.368 --> 00:18:38.904
I did everything. It was me.

287
00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:40.105
Me.

288
00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:50.449
Gong Hyung Kyu is not related to any of the other victims.

289
00:18:50.783 --> 00:18:54.987
I could provoke Han Gi Eun, who is the reporter who first reported it.

290
00:18:55.554 --> 00:18:59.158
He reported articles daily like it was an exclusive coverage.

291
00:18:59.558 --> 00:19:02.327
We could attract the culprit from that.

292
00:19:03.695 --> 00:19:05.097
- Let's meet him right away. - Okay.

293
00:19:06.565 --> 00:19:09.968
I searched the five victims that were killed by the culprit.

294
00:19:09.968 --> 00:19:12.438
There weren't any overlapping points...

295
00:19:12.438 --> 00:19:15.808
in the police who arrested them,

296
00:19:15.908 --> 00:19:17.943
public defender, and prosecutor.

297
00:19:17.943 --> 00:19:20.813
But it's confirmed that all of the victims' cases were handled...

298
00:19:20.813 --> 00:19:23.215
at the Seoul Eastern District Court.

299
00:19:25.117 --> 00:19:26.819
Okay, thank you.

300
00:19:29.087 --> 00:19:32.057
The NCI came to ask help from me.

301
00:19:32.124 --> 00:19:34.827
Our team manager was busy, so we came here instead.

302
00:19:34.927 --> 00:19:36.295
Team Manager Kang Ki Hyung?

303
00:19:36.829 --> 00:19:38.664
It's such an honor.

304
00:19:38.764 --> 00:19:40.732
He was on the high roll once.

305
00:19:40.732 --> 00:19:43.168
It was even hard to get an interview with him.

306
00:19:43.969 --> 00:19:45.337
You also won't get one from him now.

307
00:19:45.938 --> 00:19:46.939
Really?

308
00:19:47.272 --> 00:19:49.007
You must be really busy these days.

309
00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:51.043
We also are as you can see.

310
00:19:52.478 --> 00:19:53.479
Reporter Han.

311
00:19:53.479 --> 00:19:54.780
("The cleaner of the streets who took over the city")

312
00:19:56.748 --> 00:19:59.618
You reported this case...

313
00:19:59.618 --> 00:20:01.086
faster than anybody else.

314
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.490
You were even faster than the police sometimes.

315
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.526
Where did you get the information?

316
00:20:08.994 --> 00:20:10.429
Shouldn't you be faster than the investigation...

317
00:20:10.929 --> 00:20:13.599
if you're a good reporter?

318
00:20:16.869 --> 00:20:19.037
I can help you if you want.

319
00:20:19.638 --> 00:20:22.875
But I will have to meet Team Manager Kang in person.

320
00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:41.793
We need to ask some questions.

321
00:20:41.793 --> 00:20:44.596
Please answer if you have anything that comes to mind.

322
00:20:44.596 --> 00:20:45.964
The culprit would have been usually quiet,

323
00:20:45.964 --> 00:20:48.867
but would have displayed behavior that stands out when in stress.

324
00:20:48.867 --> 00:20:50.636
Look at these papers.

325
00:20:51.136 --> 00:20:54.273
It would be easier to find someone who's not like that here.

326
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.485
Wherever he is, he's not noticeable.

327
00:21:06.485 --> 00:21:08.186
He will be like a ghost.

328
00:21:08.754 --> 00:21:11.957
But he knows specific things about cases.

329
00:21:12.357 --> 00:21:16.094
He would have constant access to crimes in any way.

330
00:21:16.528 --> 00:21:20.699
It's highly possible that he gets angry about crimes while he works.

331
00:21:26.638 --> 00:21:29.908
If you talk about the well-known crimes committed by vigilantes,

332
00:21:29.908 --> 00:21:32.277
the culprit will have a lenient perspective.

333
00:21:32.744 --> 00:21:35.147
But he won't bring it up.

334
00:21:35.347 --> 00:21:37.783
Do you want an honest answer from me?

335
00:21:38.984 --> 00:21:42.788
This is a place where people dealing with crimes work all day.

336
00:21:43.188 --> 00:21:45.857
They won't be able to commit murder,

337
00:21:46.024 --> 00:21:48.994
but they would all want to punish those who have...

338
00:21:49.328 --> 00:21:52.898
better lives than us although they have committed crimes.

339
00:21:53.398 --> 00:21:57.235
Most of the people will have to protect the culprits here.

340
00:21:58.236 --> 00:21:59.404
Goodbye.

341
00:22:02.107 --> 00:22:05.877
(The Court Clerk)

342
00:22:06.078 --> 00:22:09.047
How did you come up with the hypothesis that it's a vigilante?

343
00:22:09.448 --> 00:22:12.017
The culprit ensures the safety of the people.

344
00:22:12.284 --> 00:22:14.319
The safety of the people?

345
00:22:15.687 --> 00:22:20.225
To be honest, it's true that the police can't protect us.

346
00:22:21.259 --> 00:22:23.729
The police can't establish justice in the society...

347
00:22:24.062 --> 00:22:25.998
which is why the culprit is doing it himself.

348
00:22:26.098 --> 00:22:30.369
Do you mean to say that the culprit charged with murder is a hero?

349
00:22:31.436 --> 00:22:34.373
People see things differently, don't they?

350
00:22:34.573 --> 00:22:38.243
We need to hear more from you about the victims.

351
00:22:39.077 --> 00:22:40.178
Here.

352
00:22:41.346 --> 00:22:42.414
This woman...

353
00:22:43.348 --> 00:22:45.617
was involved in a trivial case.

354
00:22:46.018 --> 00:22:49.655
Everyone was fooled by the lawyer in the participatory trial...

355
00:22:49.788 --> 00:22:51.156
when he said that addiction is also an illness.

356
00:22:51.857 --> 00:22:56.028
And this man bought the victim's family with money.

357
00:22:57.496 --> 00:22:59.998
He had beaten up the woman he was living with.

358
00:23:00.832 --> 00:23:02.768
He got tattoos all over her body with his name.

359
00:23:02.768 --> 00:23:04.169
But he was found not guilty.

360
00:23:05.003 --> 00:23:06.338
How about Lee Hyun Jae?

361
00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:08.907
It was drunk driving.

362
00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:11.877
It was a tragedy,

363
00:23:12.177 --> 00:23:14.146
but it can happen to anyone.

364
00:23:15.213 --> 00:23:17.015
How about the culprit we are looking for?

365
00:23:17.416 --> 00:23:20.285
What do you think has happened to him in the past?

366
00:23:20.619 --> 00:23:21.687
The culprit...

367
00:23:22.287 --> 00:23:26.258
must have been involved in a serious crime.

368
00:23:26.725 --> 00:23:27.993
He would have been a victim.

369
00:23:28.727 --> 00:23:31.730
It would have been more serious than we think.

370
00:23:32.264 --> 00:23:33.465
Is that...

371
00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:36.268
why you think of him as a hero?

372
00:23:37.169 --> 00:23:38.170
Well.

373
00:23:39.137 --> 00:23:42.874
Nowadays, we accept even the strangest things.

374
00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:47.479
It's true that the world has become insane.

375
00:23:48.113 --> 00:23:51.116
No one can survive it in their right minds.

376
00:23:53.885 --> 00:23:56.655
This picture was not made public by the media.

377
00:23:56.855 --> 00:23:59.257
This could make you a little uncomfortable.

378
00:24:00.158 --> 00:24:02.694
I'm accustomed to pictures from crime scenes.

379
00:24:05.964 --> 00:24:08.400
That's where we are stuck.

380
00:24:09.868 --> 00:24:13.004
Did he put that in to kill him effectively,

381
00:24:13.004 --> 00:24:15.707
or is it symbolic?

382
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.444
It's interesting.

383
00:24:48.974 --> 00:24:51.943
If it were you, why would you...

384
00:24:51.943 --> 00:24:54.346
stab someone's ear with a stone?

385
00:24:54.646 --> 00:24:57.015
Are you really asking this because you need my help?

386
00:24:59.417 --> 00:25:01.253
You made him...

387
00:25:01.787 --> 00:25:05.257
into a hero with ease.

388
00:25:05.657 --> 00:25:06.658
So...

389
00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:08.994
What is it you want to say?

390
00:25:09.127 --> 00:25:10.395
Do you know...

391
00:25:10.929 --> 00:25:14.332
that the emotions you experience through serial killers...

392
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.668
are no different from killing?

393
00:25:19.237 --> 00:25:23.408
In fact, you would not have wanted him to be caught for a while.

394
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:27.646
What happens to others is none of your business, right?

395
00:25:31.049 --> 00:25:32.417
What are you doing?

396
00:25:32.984 --> 00:25:36.288
If that's not the case, help us find the culprit.

397
00:25:37.155 --> 00:25:39.357
That's what you should really do.

398
00:25:40.959 --> 00:25:42.194
Please cooperate with us.

399
00:25:42.627 --> 00:25:44.930
There has been an incident at this court.

400
00:25:46.898 --> 00:25:49.367
But these documents are little strange.

401
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.876
The trial records of the victim, Lee Hyun Jae, is missing.

402
00:25:58.076 --> 00:26:00.145
Yes. According to the order,

403
00:26:00.145 --> 00:26:02.914
there should be documents from February 2017.

404
00:26:03.415 --> 00:26:04.416
We should look into it.

405
00:26:06.985 --> 00:26:08.019
Excuse me.

406
00:26:08.486 --> 00:26:09.487
Yes?

407
00:26:09.487 --> 00:26:10.989
Can you take a look at this?

408
00:26:10.989 --> 00:26:13.058
Why can't we see records from here?

409
00:26:14.993 --> 00:26:18.530
It's because the court stenographer hasn't interpreted it yet.

410
00:26:18.797 --> 00:26:21.066
Stenographer?

411
00:26:21.633 --> 00:26:25.537
We're also having trouble because it's being delayed.

412
00:26:25.837 --> 00:26:29.875
We did have a lot of work, but he's on sick leaves often,

413
00:26:30.075 --> 00:26:33.144
and the interpretation work has been delayed...

414
00:26:33.144 --> 00:26:34.546
by 3 to 6 months.

415
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.718
(Personal Information)

416
00:26:41.987 --> 00:26:43.255
(Personal Information)

417
00:26:45.123 --> 00:26:46.458
(Personal Information)

418
00:26:49.895 --> 00:26:51.162
(Pictures from the Crime Scene)

419
00:26:54.699 --> 00:26:57.068
The victims have all been charged with a serious murder,

420
00:26:57.068 --> 00:26:58.737
but have been found innocent.

421
00:26:58.737 --> 00:27:01.039
It's likely that the culprit is someone...

422
00:27:01.306 --> 00:27:04.042
working for or near the judicial system.

423
00:27:04.409 --> 00:27:05.944
He kept...

424
00:27:08.246 --> 00:27:10.916
He kept moving his fingers.

425
00:27:10.982 --> 00:27:12.617
It looked like he was playing a piano.

426
00:27:18.556 --> 00:27:19.724
Yes, Team Manager Kang.

427
00:27:19.724 --> 00:27:21.960
Can you look into the stenographer who was in charge...

428
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.728
of the records of the victims' cases?

429
00:27:23.728 --> 00:27:25.096
Yes, I will.

430
00:27:26.364 --> 00:27:27.532
Stenographer?

431
00:27:27.632 --> 00:27:29.034
It's someone who's in the court...

432
00:27:29.167 --> 00:27:31.403
and knows every specific details about the case.

433
00:27:32.103 --> 00:27:33.738
Then that movement...

434
00:27:34.339 --> 00:27:36.908
He kept moving his fingers.

435
00:27:39.844 --> 00:27:42.647
As he records violent and terrible crimes every day,

436
00:27:43.748 --> 00:27:46.318
he could feel like he was the one delivering the judgement.

437
00:27:47.652 --> 00:27:50.722
That could have been what intensified the trauma.

438
00:27:51.356 --> 00:27:54.626
Stenographers in the court are like ghosts in the court.

439
00:27:55.093 --> 00:27:58.396
They just record the testimonies of the court all day.

440
00:27:59.597 --> 00:28:01.333
Where is he now?

441
00:28:04.102 --> 00:28:07.238
He should be in courtroom 412 now.

442
00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:09.107
That's the room we had visited.

443
00:28:11.776 --> 00:28:16.214
(The Court Clerk)

444
00:28:17.649 --> 00:28:19.517
He would have heard everything.

445
00:28:25.757 --> 00:28:28.460
The stenographer in charge of the the victims' cases...

446
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.427
is Jung Do Il.

447
00:28:29.527 --> 00:28:34.132
Find out if he was involved in any serious crimes in the past.

448
00:28:35.333 --> 00:28:37.635
In 2001, his family died...

449
00:28:37.635 --> 00:28:39.637
as a result of burglary.

450
00:28:40.638 --> 00:28:42.607
He was only 15 years old then,

451
00:28:43.608 --> 00:28:45.076
and he was the only survivor.

452
00:28:52.917 --> 00:28:54.819
We're from NCI.

453
00:28:55.854 --> 00:28:59.858
Is the stenographer in charge of this case called Jung Do Il?

454
00:29:00.025 --> 00:29:03.328
No, he took a sick leave and went home.

455
00:29:06.498 --> 00:29:09.734
He must have found out that we're after him.

456
00:29:17.175 --> 00:29:19.077
- Nana. - Yes, Hyun Jun?

457
00:29:19.077 --> 00:29:21.279
Send us the address of Jung Do Il.

458
00:29:21.546 --> 00:29:23.014
Okay, I'll send it right away.

459
00:29:30.255 --> 00:29:33.625
Team Manager Kang, his phone is turned off.

460
00:29:34.592 --> 00:29:35.927
Do you think he went home?

461
00:29:36.227 --> 00:29:38.329
Find out which case it was...

462
00:29:38.329 --> 00:29:41.266
that he finished interpreting recently.

463
00:30:11.496 --> 00:30:13.798
Jung Do Il will try to do his job...

464
00:30:13.965 --> 00:30:15.834
until the end.

465
00:30:16.734 --> 00:30:18.436
We need to find the victim that...

466
00:30:18.837 --> 00:30:20.505
he's after before he does.

467
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.702
Jung Do Il, this is the police! Open the door.

468
00:31:18.096 --> 00:31:20.698
Do you think he wanted to prevent someone coming from outside?

469
00:31:20.899 --> 00:31:22.634
Jung Dong Il sat in court...

470
00:31:23.067 --> 00:31:24.903
and wrote in shorthand every day.

471
00:31:26.004 --> 00:31:27.605
It must be that from one point,

472
00:31:28.072 --> 00:31:29.507
he couldn't stop talking...

473
00:31:30.708 --> 00:31:33.044
even outside the court.

474
00:31:33.144 --> 00:31:36.047
Apparently, he kept mumbling even in the cathedral.

475
00:31:36.548 --> 00:31:38.016
He must have been compulsive,

476
00:31:38.183 --> 00:31:40.118
and suffered from horrible auditory hallucinations.

477
00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.855
This must be what...

478
00:31:44.155 --> 00:31:45.356
the stone in the ears meant.

479
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.025
He wanted to return...

480
00:31:47.292 --> 00:31:49.727
the pain he'd suffered to the victims.

481
00:32:04.842 --> 00:32:06.744
- Yes. - Team Manager Kang.

482
00:32:06.744 --> 00:32:09.647
I'm looking through Jung Do Il's last shorthand court notes.

483
00:32:10.148 --> 00:32:12.617
But none of the transcriptions for recent victims...

484
00:32:12.617 --> 00:32:14.485
are up yet.

485
00:32:14.719 --> 00:32:16.554
It's probably because the situation has changed.

486
00:32:16.888 --> 00:32:18.289
Now Jung Do Il, himself,

487
00:32:18.756 --> 00:32:20.458
had to reach a verdict.

488
00:32:29.634 --> 00:32:31.736
That's the only photo.

489
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.973
His clock stopped ticking after that day.

490
00:32:36.608 --> 00:32:38.676
This is his parents' life insurance certificate.

491
00:32:38.943 --> 00:32:40.912
He didn't even collect the benefits.

492
00:32:45.016 --> 00:32:46.017
Yes.

493
00:32:46.417 --> 00:32:48.586
I found the killer's past records.

494
00:32:49.153 --> 00:32:51.222
Jung Do Il's father, Jung Hyung Soo,

495
00:32:51.222 --> 00:32:53.558
was a professor who taught folklore.

496
00:32:54.292 --> 00:32:55.293
The murderer at the time...

497
00:32:55.293 --> 00:32:57.595
was a student of his, Oh Kyeung Sub.

498
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:59.797
But...

499
00:33:43.107 --> 00:33:47.245
at the time Oh Kyeung Sub's blood alcohol level was 0.25 percent.

500
00:33:48.012 --> 00:33:50.848
He claimed that Jung Hyung Soo had abused him for years,

501
00:33:50.882 --> 00:33:53.117
and suffered from psychological damages as a result.

502
00:33:53.117 --> 00:33:55.153
He was sentenced to only 10 years.

503
00:33:55.653 --> 00:33:58.556
And then, the sentence was reduced to seven years.

504
00:33:59.357 --> 00:34:03.127
Oh Kyeung Sub became religious after being released from jail.

505
00:34:03.428 --> 00:34:04.595
Right now,

506
00:34:04.896 --> 00:34:06.798
he's abroad doing missionary work.

507
00:34:21.846 --> 00:34:22.847
Team Manager Kang.

508
00:34:33.257 --> 00:34:36.327
Does this mean he had this many people to kill?

509
00:34:36.627 --> 00:34:38.162
He probably thought...

510
00:34:38.162 --> 00:34:40.465
there was no stopping once he'd started.

511
00:34:48.339 --> 00:34:50.875
The keyboard is so worn out that the letters are erased.

512
00:34:52.343 --> 00:34:54.579
I can't understand what this means at all.

513
00:34:54.579 --> 00:34:57.715
This is an older version of the shorthand keyboard.

514
00:34:58.182 --> 00:35:02.353
In this case, stenographers use 36 letter and number keys...

515
00:35:02.353 --> 00:35:05.590
to type as if playing harmonies on the piano.

516
00:35:05.656 --> 00:35:06.924
Depending on the stenographer,

517
00:35:06.924 --> 00:35:09.727
some even have their own secret codes.

518
00:35:10.194 --> 00:35:12.997
Court stenographers in particular...

519
00:35:12.997 --> 00:35:15.333
mostly have their own unique system.

520
00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:16.968
So other people can't decode it.

521
00:35:17.835 --> 00:35:19.137
Jung Do Il...

522
00:35:19.437 --> 00:35:22.140
probably knows that we're looking for him right now.

523
00:35:23.408 --> 00:35:24.742
Where could he be?

524
00:35:26.644 --> 00:35:28.613
We have to go inside his brain...

525
00:35:28.613 --> 00:35:29.747
and find out.

526
00:35:37.188 --> 00:35:39.157
There has to be an answer in here.

527
00:35:39.557 --> 00:35:43.394
Condense the list to felons who were found not guilty.

528
00:35:44.395 --> 00:35:46.931
Considering how serious Jung Do Il's murders are becoming,

529
00:35:47.165 --> 00:35:49.000
we should focus on violent crimes.

530
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.369
Wouldn't it be faster to start with the most recent cases?

531
00:35:51.369 --> 00:35:54.005
Jung Do Il has a neurotic compulsion disorder.

532
00:35:54.272 --> 00:35:56.073
People like him go to the very beginning...

533
00:35:56.073 --> 00:35:57.642
to move onto the next job.

534
00:35:57.842 --> 00:36:00.178
So we still have to rummage through all of this.

535
00:36:01.179 --> 00:36:02.213
Book bands.

536
00:36:04.515 --> 00:36:06.184
He marked it this way.

537
00:36:06.584 --> 00:36:07.952
The traces are still here.

538
00:36:19.764 --> 00:36:23.067
Jung Do Il already knew that we'd be here.

539
00:36:24.769 --> 00:36:26.170
If he got rid of the book bands...

540
00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:28.940
to get rid of evidence or to stop us from finding him...

541
00:36:31.375 --> 00:36:33.377
I have to look more into this.

542
00:36:35.313 --> 00:36:36.314
Nana.

543
00:36:36.614 --> 00:36:39.016
Yes, Hyun Jun. What can I do for you?

544
00:36:40.084 --> 00:36:42.653
Check court records for the dates I'm about to tell you.

545
00:36:46.991 --> 00:36:48.860
May 21, 2011,

546
00:36:49.827 --> 00:36:51.429
January 10, 2009,

547
00:36:52.463 --> 00:36:54.699
September 24, 2014.

548
00:36:55.533 --> 00:36:56.534
Wait.

549
00:36:57.268 --> 00:36:58.269
Wait a moment.

550
00:36:58.769 --> 00:36:59.837
I remember.

551
00:37:00.071 --> 00:37:02.340
It's the dates of the victims' rulings.

552
00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.175
How many pages are there?

553
00:37:07.011 --> 00:37:08.012
I found it.

554
00:37:08.012 --> 00:37:10.181
In the court records of the dates you gave me,

555
00:37:10.181 --> 00:37:12.283
the five victims are included.

556
00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.452
They must be in here.

557
00:37:16.854 --> 00:37:18.155
Wait.

558
00:37:18.823 --> 00:37:20.391
There's a murder case similar...

559
00:37:20.391 --> 00:37:22.760
to that of Jung Do Il's family.

560
00:37:23.427 --> 00:37:25.530
It happened in 2008.

561
00:37:25.796 --> 00:37:28.099
Hwang In Chul who was in high school at the time...

562
00:37:28.199 --> 00:37:30.334
murdered his own parents.

563
00:37:30.701 --> 00:37:34.071
He claimed to have suffered domestic abuse for a long time...

564
00:37:34.405 --> 00:37:36.807
and became mentally ill as a result.

565
00:37:36.807 --> 00:37:38.676
He was found not guilty and let go.

566
00:37:41.379 --> 00:37:42.413
I found it.

567
00:37:44.582 --> 00:37:46.384
This was hidden in between the drawers.

568
00:37:57.028 --> 00:37:59.530
Jung Do Il's family was murdered...

569
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.566
by one of his father's students.

570
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.269
He must have thought that Hwang In Chul, who killed his parents,

571
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.940
needed a new verdict after being found not guilty.

572
00:38:36.133 --> 00:38:38.235
The person you are trying to reach is not available.

573
00:38:38.402 --> 00:38:40.071
Hwang In Chul isn't picking up.

574
00:38:40.237 --> 00:38:42.673
And his wife Kang Ji Yeon is still on the line.

575
00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.609
Request emergency backup to the local police station.

576
00:38:44.609 --> 00:38:45.610
Okay.

577
00:38:54.619 --> 00:38:55.753
But I still bought it.

578
00:38:56.387 --> 00:38:58.956
He deserves to die. Kill him. Kill him.

579
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.075
Okay. Hurry home.

580
00:39:22.546 --> 00:39:25.983
(Emergency situation)

581
00:39:27.284 --> 00:39:30.588
- Hello? - I'm Kang Ki Young from the NCI.

582
00:39:30.588 --> 00:39:32.390
Is Hwang In Chul home?

583
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.225
He's not home right now.

584
00:39:34.425 --> 00:39:35.526
What is this about?

585
00:39:46.037 --> 00:39:47.038
Where are you right now?

586
00:39:47.138 --> 00:39:48.439
I was just on the phone with you.

587
00:39:49.206 --> 00:39:50.374
I'm in front of the house.

588
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.278
Honey, wait.

589
00:39:54.412 --> 00:39:55.846
No, that's not it.

590
00:40:01.786 --> 00:40:02.987
I'll kill you.

591
00:40:02.987 --> 00:40:04.155
In Chul!

592
00:40:05.289 --> 00:40:06.323
In Chul!

593
00:40:13.297 --> 00:40:14.365
In Chul!

594
00:40:15.966 --> 00:40:17.068
Don't come!

595
00:40:17.735 --> 00:40:19.470
I'm going to kill him.

596
00:40:20.738 --> 00:40:23.340
Let me go. He's my husband!

597
00:40:23.674 --> 00:40:25.543
- Let me go! - Don't come near me.

598
00:40:25.643 --> 00:40:27.778
In Chul! Mister, help me.

599
00:40:27.778 --> 00:40:29.080
Help me!

600
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.314
Do you see all those people?

601
00:40:30.314 --> 00:40:32.717
Tell everyone here.

602
00:40:33.017 --> 00:40:34.719
How did you kill your parents again?

603
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:38.956
He's my husband!

604
00:40:38.956 --> 00:40:43.160
Tell everyone that you shamelessly lied to them.

605
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.595
Tell them.

606
00:40:44.595 --> 00:40:45.596
I already...

607
00:40:46.363 --> 00:40:47.631
said everything then.

608
00:40:47.631 --> 00:40:49.700
- No! - Calm down.

609
00:40:50.267 --> 00:40:51.936
They kept hitting me.

610
00:40:52.103 --> 00:40:54.004
I had no choice!

611
00:40:54.004 --> 00:40:56.340
Don't lie to me!

612
00:40:57.341 --> 00:40:59.310
You repeatedly abused your parents.

613
00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:01.378
Because of drugs, right?

614
00:41:01.378 --> 00:41:03.614
You sold drugs!

615
00:41:03.948 --> 00:41:05.850
And you still call yourself a son.

616
00:41:06.317 --> 00:41:09.253
Your mom had to lie...

617
00:41:10.254 --> 00:41:11.555
and say she did it instead of you.

618
00:41:12.389 --> 00:41:15.493
She never knew her son would kill her.

619
00:41:18.195 --> 00:41:20.731
Devils like you should never have been born.

620
00:41:20.731 --> 00:41:22.133
Let me go!

621
00:41:33.277 --> 00:41:34.278
I'll go talk to him.

622
00:41:34.278 --> 00:41:35.646
He's too agitated.

623
00:41:36.147 --> 00:41:37.148
It's dangerous.

624
00:41:37.148 --> 00:41:38.482
We should still try.

625
00:41:38.482 --> 00:41:39.650
Come with me.

626
00:41:43.254 --> 00:41:44.355
Don't come here!

627
00:41:44.989 --> 00:41:46.557
I'm not interested in you guys.

628
00:41:47.958 --> 00:41:48.959
Jung Do Il,

629
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.562
let that go.

630
00:41:52.263 --> 00:41:53.597
No. I'm going to kill him.

631
00:41:53.597 --> 00:41:55.699
No, you can't!

632
00:41:55.833 --> 00:41:57.635
Do you think he deserves to die?

633
00:41:57.635 --> 00:41:59.537
He should have died years ago.

634
00:41:59.637 --> 00:42:03.040
He killed his parents, but he's still here!

635
00:42:03.207 --> 00:42:04.642
I think so too.

636
00:42:07.077 --> 00:42:09.079
But it's not up to us...

637
00:42:09.079 --> 00:42:10.281
to kill him or let him live.

638
00:42:10.948 --> 00:42:12.349
You think...

639
00:42:13.751 --> 00:42:15.920
a person like this deserves to live?

640
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.221
Jung Do Il.

641
00:42:18.489 --> 00:42:21.592
We'll redo the whole investigation on the crime he committed.

642
00:42:21.826 --> 00:42:22.893
I promise.

643
00:42:23.227 --> 00:42:24.228
No.

644
00:42:24.995 --> 00:42:25.996
No!

645
00:42:27.198 --> 00:42:29.900
It's up to me to punish guys like this.

646
00:42:31.468 --> 00:42:32.536
Get out of my way.

647
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:36.106
I'm going to kill him and kill myself too!

648
00:42:37.508 --> 00:42:40.611
Records show that Jung Do Il repeatedly requested to meet...

649
00:42:40.778 --> 00:42:43.080
the murderer who killed his parents.

650
00:42:43.914 --> 00:42:46.750
And the murderer Oh Kyeung Sub only allowed it once...

651
00:42:47.017 --> 00:42:48.919
until he was released.

652
00:42:50.221 --> 00:42:51.388
Then you will forever...

653
00:42:52.122 --> 00:42:54.658
lose the chance to find out the truth.

654
00:42:55.793 --> 00:42:57.294
Why did Oh Kyeung Sub...

655
00:42:58.095 --> 00:43:00.431
do that to your family? For what reason?

656
00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:02.499
That doesn't matter anymore.

657
00:43:04.201 --> 00:43:09.240
They were released because of all of you here.

658
00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.908
I'm sorry.

659
00:43:13.143 --> 00:43:16.113
Please forgive me.

660
00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:18.249
Forgive you?

661
00:43:18.249 --> 00:43:20.017
I repented to god.

662
00:43:21.719 --> 00:43:23.787
The lord forgave me.

663
00:43:25.623 --> 00:43:28.893
I received forgiveness, and I atoned.

664
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:31.795
Please don't come visit me.

665
00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:35.099
Only the lord can punish me.

666
00:43:41.205 --> 00:43:42.206
Hey.

667
00:43:42.406 --> 00:43:45.643
Hey. What are you saying?

668
00:43:46.543 --> 00:43:48.679
Hey!

669
00:43:48.746 --> 00:43:51.548
Forgiveness?

670
00:43:51.715 --> 00:43:53.017
Forgiveness?

671
00:43:53.717 --> 00:43:54.919
Says who?

672
00:43:55.352 --> 00:43:58.155
Says who? Says who?

673
00:44:00.057 --> 00:44:01.292
Don't kid yourself.

674
00:44:01.825 --> 00:44:03.827
It's not the almighty who forgives.

675
00:44:22.112 --> 00:44:24.214
Only public law shall be like water, and justice shall flow like sewage.

676
00:44:24.548 --> 00:44:26.850
Only public law shall be like water, and justice shall flow like sewage.

677
00:44:26.951 --> 00:44:29.353
Only public law shall be like water, and justice shall flow like sewage.

678
00:44:29.453 --> 00:44:33.991
Only public law shall be like water, and justice shall flow like sewage.

679
00:44:44.201 --> 00:44:48.906
Only public law shall be like water, and justice shall flow like sewage.

680
00:45:28.045 --> 00:45:30.848
Only public law shall be like water, and justice shall flow like sewage.

681
00:45:44.328 --> 00:45:47.031
Only!

682
00:45:48.532 --> 00:45:50.534
Only my judgement is the truth.

683
00:45:50.534 --> 00:45:52.236
Please don't kill me.

684
00:45:52.403 --> 00:45:53.570
Don't kill him!

685
00:45:54.004 --> 00:45:56.073
Let go! Let me go!

686
00:45:56.073 --> 00:45:57.174
My son...

687
00:45:58.575 --> 00:46:00.711
She's pregnant with our child.

688
00:46:01.578 --> 00:46:03.947
No, it's too dangerous.

689
00:46:06.417 --> 00:46:09.620
Don't kill him. Please!

690
00:46:12.289 --> 00:46:13.991
Why you...

691
00:46:19.396 --> 00:46:20.397
- Oh my gosh! - Goodness.

692
00:46:21.365 --> 00:46:22.399
- No! - Goodness.

693
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.441
Jung Do Il.

694
00:46:31.341 --> 00:46:32.376
Jung Do Il!

695
00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:35.746
An ambulance! Bring an ambulance.

696
00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:40.584
Breathe. Breathe!

697
00:46:47.758 --> 00:46:48.759
I...

698
00:46:50.127 --> 00:46:51.962
I just couldn't believe it.

699
00:46:52.996 --> 00:46:55.032
I couldn't believe that he was fine living his life...

700
00:46:55.933 --> 00:46:58.435
after doing something so horrible like that.

701
00:47:05.909 --> 00:47:06.910
Jung Do Il.

702
00:47:07.678 --> 00:47:08.846
Jung Do Il!

703
00:47:18.622 --> 00:47:19.890
Are you okay?

704
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.802
This is judgement by justice.

705
00:47:33.103 --> 00:47:34.138
No!

706
00:47:34.505 --> 00:47:35.572
- Let go! - Hey!

707
00:47:35.572 --> 00:47:37.141
- You! - Take him!

708
00:47:37.207 --> 00:47:38.542
Let me go!

709
00:47:38.742 --> 00:47:40.611
- Ambulance! - No!

710
00:47:41.278 --> 00:47:42.779
Let me go!

711
00:47:42.946 --> 00:47:44.515
No!

712
00:47:44.715 --> 00:47:45.782
Let go!

713
00:47:46.917 --> 00:47:48.085
- Ambulance! - No!

714
00:47:50.287 --> 00:47:51.922
- Ambulance! - What do I do!

715
00:47:51.922 --> 00:47:53.323
No!

716
00:47:56.326 --> 00:47:58.295
"I am against violence..."

717
00:47:58.428 --> 00:48:00.898
"because even if it seems to serve a greater good,"

718
00:48:01.165 --> 00:48:03.167
"it in itself is only temporary."

719
00:48:03.734 --> 00:48:07.371
"As long as violence exists, evil will persist forever."

720
00:48:07.704 --> 00:48:08.839
Gandhi.

721
00:48:11.041 --> 00:48:13.810
What do you think about the recent incident?

722
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.179
He deserved to die.

723
00:48:15.179 --> 00:48:16.914
I think violent criminals...

724
00:48:17.114 --> 00:48:18.916
deserve to suffer through the same thing.

725
00:48:19.049 --> 00:48:21.185
I would have done the same thing.

726
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:24.288
To be honest, the reality is that you can't trust the law.

727
00:48:24.288 --> 00:48:28.458
This is terrifying. What do I tell my children?

728
00:48:29.359 --> 00:48:30.561
I have no idea.

729
00:48:30.561 --> 00:48:32.196
Still, murder is wrong.

730
00:48:32.296 --> 00:48:33.864
He's a murderer.

731
00:48:34.131 --> 00:48:36.733
He was executed in his own way.

732
00:48:36.733 --> 00:48:38.468
In some way, he's a hero.

733
00:48:38.468 --> 00:48:40.003
Didn't the police shoot him on purpose?

734
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:41.672
I read online that...

735
00:48:41.672 --> 00:48:44.241
he was shot dead because they thought he'd be found guilty.

736
00:48:50.113 --> 00:48:51.148
Yes.

737
00:48:51.815 --> 00:48:54.451
Do you think Hwang In Chul's murderer will get a jail sentence?

738
00:48:54.751 --> 00:48:55.752
Yes.

739
00:48:56.253 --> 00:48:59.223
He had no relations to Hwang In Chul.

740
00:49:00.123 --> 00:49:01.959
He was only a copycat killer...

741
00:49:02.659 --> 00:49:03.894
who empathized with Jung Do Il.

742
00:49:04.161 --> 00:49:07.331
I think the media is steering this case into a weird direction.

743
00:49:07.698 --> 00:49:10.100
I was spooked watching the street interviews.

744
00:49:10.767 --> 00:49:14.504
The law can't do its job, so the world is going insane.

745
00:49:16.206 --> 00:49:17.507
To be honest, even I...

746
00:49:17.874 --> 00:49:20.344
have frequent moments when I want to use my fist instead of the law.

747
00:49:20.978 --> 00:49:23.213
The public must feel more so.

748
00:49:24.147 --> 00:49:28.252
The problem is that he crossed a line he shouldn't have crossed.

749
00:49:33.857 --> 00:49:34.858
Do you want to go for a drink?

750
00:49:39.563 --> 00:49:41.365
Sure, let's.

751
00:49:57.648 --> 00:50:01.285
(Seoul Station)

752
00:50:06.323 --> 00:50:08.058
It's not too heavy? You're okay?

753
00:50:08.558 --> 00:50:10.093
That's good.

754
00:50:10.394 --> 00:50:11.461
Yes, Team Manager Kang.

755
00:50:12.462 --> 00:50:13.730
The trip was nice.

756
00:50:14.164 --> 00:50:17.034
The food was good, and our hotel was comfortable.

757
00:50:18.302 --> 00:50:19.369
The kids?

758
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.005
- Auntie. - Yes.

759
00:50:22.372 --> 00:50:25.909
Why are those guys sleeping there? They don't have a home?

760
00:50:25.909 --> 00:50:26.977
Well,

761
00:50:27.511 --> 00:50:29.513
they might not have a home,

762
00:50:29.513 --> 00:50:32.549
or they might not be able to go into their home.

763
00:50:32.716 --> 00:50:34.885
Why can't they go home?

764
00:50:35.285 --> 00:50:37.954
Well, I'm not sure.

765
00:50:39.089 --> 00:50:42.592
Oh, right! We were going to get some food, right?

766
00:50:42.826 --> 00:50:43.994
Shall we?

767
00:50:43.994 --> 00:50:45.862
I'm so hungry. Let's go.

768
00:50:45.862 --> 00:50:48.598
Kids, here's some pasta. Eat this.

769
00:50:48.598 --> 00:50:50.534
Okay.

770
00:50:59.576 --> 00:51:01.011
Good times.

771
00:51:04.581 --> 00:51:08.218
Min Young, you've been surfing on the web this whole time.

772
00:51:08.218 --> 00:51:09.820
What's going on?

773
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:13.156
My landlord is talking about my lease.

774
00:51:13.924 --> 00:51:17.561
I feel like it might be better to just buy my own house these days.

775
00:51:18.962 --> 00:51:21.598
You'll sign your name, but the bank owns your house.

776
00:51:21.765 --> 00:51:23.033
That's pointless.

777
00:51:23.834 --> 00:51:24.835
Min Young,

778
00:51:25.335 --> 00:51:28.538
I've been working too hard these days.

779
00:51:29.406 --> 00:51:32.209
All I have is my looks and money.

780
00:51:32.442 --> 00:51:33.944
But I don't have anything to spend it on.

781
00:51:34.478 --> 00:51:36.546
I don't have a husband to feed,

782
00:51:36.546 --> 00:51:38.448
or cute children.

783
00:51:39.182 --> 00:51:41.151
This is all for Ha Eun's sake.

784
00:51:42.052 --> 00:51:43.253
How much do you need?

785
00:51:44.321 --> 00:51:45.555
How much?

786
00:51:45.555 --> 00:51:47.391
Thanks, but I can't.

787
00:51:47.524 --> 00:51:49.559
Min Young, life is all about timing.

788
00:51:49.559 --> 00:51:52.629
Being too square is a shortcut to suffering.

789
00:51:53.063 --> 00:51:54.464
Life isn't much.

790
00:51:54.631 --> 00:51:56.266
You help each other out,

791
00:51:56.266 --> 00:51:59.436
rely on one another, and make each other uncomfortable at times.

792
00:52:00.637 --> 00:52:03.774
I told you. All I have is money.

793
00:52:04.141 --> 00:52:05.776
Oh, and my looks too.

794
00:52:07.077 --> 00:52:09.980
Han Byul, give me some too.

795
00:52:11.882 --> 00:52:14.017
Hey, lady.

796
00:52:14.317 --> 00:52:16.420
- What? - Come here.

797
00:52:17.454 --> 00:52:19.055
What's up with her?

798
00:52:19.055 --> 00:52:21.591
Well, he's just...

799
00:52:21.591 --> 00:52:22.592
No, that's not it.

800
00:52:45.015 --> 00:52:46.450
You...

801
00:52:50.687 --> 00:52:51.988
My bad.

802
00:52:56.793 --> 00:52:58.929
Hey, lady.

803
00:52:59.229 --> 00:53:01.331
- What? - Come here.

804
00:53:02.365 --> 00:53:03.967
What's up with her?

805
00:53:03.967 --> 00:53:06.503
Well, he's just...

806
00:53:06.503 --> 00:53:07.504
No, that's not it.

807
00:53:29.926 --> 00:53:31.361
You...

808
00:53:35.599 --> 00:53:36.900
My bad.

809
00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:41.905
National house prices have surpassed...

810
00:53:41.905 --> 00:53:44.941
the average of 300,000 dollars for the first time ver.

811
00:53:45.208 --> 00:53:46.443
According to the Bank of Korea,

812
00:53:46.443 --> 00:53:49.546
the average of house prices, including those of apartments,

813
00:53:49.546 --> 00:53:52.983
and houses was 330,000 dollars this month.

814
00:53:53.049 --> 00:53:56.620
- Compared to last year... - The place is so well decorated.

815
00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:59.155
This place must be expensive. Right?

816
00:54:02.392 --> 00:54:05.161
But can you work here?

817
00:54:05.295 --> 00:54:07.964
How is it? You like this place?

818
00:54:08.832 --> 00:54:11.535
It is quite special,

819
00:54:12.269 --> 00:54:13.803
but I've never been to a place like this.

820
00:54:15.572 --> 00:54:16.907
Should we have dinner first?

821
00:54:18.008 --> 00:54:20.110
There's food?

822
00:54:34.524 --> 00:54:36.059
I feel funny.

823
00:54:36.059 --> 00:54:37.193
You're fine.

824
00:54:37.394 --> 00:54:39.496
You'll feel better.

825
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:42.165
No, but my head really hurts.

826
00:54:42.332 --> 00:54:44.968
You'll feel happy.

827
00:54:45.535 --> 00:54:47.203
Are you sure you didn't drug my drink?

828
00:54:50.407 --> 00:54:52.475
You must have.

829
00:55:01.985 --> 00:55:04.187
Where are you going?

830
00:55:30.313 --> 00:55:31.815
(Top one percent land for the one percent!)

831
00:55:35.585 --> 00:55:39.823
(Submissions over)

832
00:55:42.392 --> 00:55:45.929
Daedong Dream Village's biggest strength is how efficient...

833
00:55:45.929 --> 00:55:48.898
the space is in consideration to how people move around.

834
00:55:49.099 --> 00:55:51.401
The space feels much bigger than it actually is.

835
00:55:51.401 --> 00:55:53.169
You can tell after seeing it, right?

836
00:55:53.169 --> 00:55:54.838
This size is most popular these days, right?

837
00:55:54.838 --> 00:55:57.073
- Yes. - Take your time.

838
00:55:59.342 --> 00:56:02.112
It would be so nice if the kitchen always looked like this.

839
00:56:02.178 --> 00:56:04.948
Exactly. I'm sick of cleaning up.

840
00:56:04.948 --> 00:56:06.583
But look at how real the props look.

841
00:56:06.583 --> 00:56:09.085
They put so much care into arranging showrooms these days.

842
00:56:10.186 --> 00:56:11.821
This isn't fake.

843
00:56:12.155 --> 00:56:13.223
- Really? - No.

844
00:56:24.801 --> 00:56:26.403
(Lee Jin Hee)

845
00:56:28.805 --> 00:56:31.741
A woman was found murdered at a showroom for Dream Village...

846
00:56:31.741 --> 00:56:33.943
in Moktan, Gyeonggi Province.

847
00:56:33.943 --> 00:56:36.513
The victim's name is Lee Jin Hee. She's 26 years old.

848
00:56:36.513 --> 00:56:39.049
She worked at a design firm.

849
00:56:40.817 --> 00:56:42.552
And 24-year-old Yoo Ah Young.

850
00:56:42.585 --> 00:56:45.889
Likewise, she was found dead in a showroom for Palace Town...

851
00:56:45.889 --> 00:56:47.624
in Gaesun-dong, Seoul.

852
00:56:48.324 --> 00:56:51.861
Both murders occurred in a showroom,

853
00:56:51.861 --> 00:56:54.397
and the weapon use is similar too.

854
00:56:54.397 --> 00:56:55.732
Considering the murder location,

855
00:56:55.732 --> 00:56:58.268
either the killer abducted the victims,

856
00:56:58.268 --> 00:57:01.371
or lured them there.

857
00:57:02.372 --> 00:57:04.674
No traces of sexual assault were found.

858
00:57:05.875 --> 00:57:07.410
According the police report,

859
00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:11.347
the killer used utensils in the kitchen to cook and drink.

860
00:57:11.581 --> 00:57:13.016
After watching TV,

861
00:57:13.016 --> 00:57:15.919
he even put in bath bombs to take a bath...

862
00:57:15.919 --> 00:57:19.055
as if that was his home.

863
00:57:19.422 --> 00:57:22.892
Why would anyone do that in a showroom?

864
00:57:22.892 --> 00:57:24.661
A showroom...

865
00:57:24.794 --> 00:57:26.696
is the manifestation of the perfect home.

866
00:57:26.696 --> 00:57:29.899
The killer may obsess over such fantasies and ideals.

867
00:57:31.334 --> 00:57:33.703
Sun Woo and Hyun Jun, go take a look at the crime scene.

868
00:57:33.703 --> 00:57:36.806
Nana, look closely...

869
00:57:36.806 --> 00:57:38.875
into if there were any similar cases in the past.

870
00:57:38.875 --> 00:57:41.845
We can go through the records from the first murder.

871
00:57:41.845 --> 00:57:43.213
- Yes. - Okay.

872
00:57:46.149 --> 00:57:48.218
(Apartment construction approved)

873
00:58:21.484 --> 00:58:24.621
Undigested food was found in the victim's stomach.

874
00:58:25.855 --> 00:58:28.158
She ate here with the culprit.

875
00:59:06.529 --> 00:59:08.731
She ate here with the culprit.

876
00:59:08.765 --> 00:59:10.500
The floors are clean without a single trace.

877
00:59:10.567 --> 00:59:12.101
Something doesn't fit.

878
00:59:12.168 --> 00:59:14.137
The showroom location...

879
00:59:14.137 --> 00:59:15.705
may be the culprit's signature.

880
00:59:15.805 --> 00:59:17.607
Save me!

881
00:59:17.807 --> 00:59:20.710
It's likely that the culprit worked on construction sites.

882
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:23.847
He's probably finding his own way through the murders.

883
00:59:24.147 --> 00:59:26.749
Then the pattern may accelerate.

884
00:59:26.749 --> 00:59:28.651
Don't kill me.

885
00:59:28.751 --> 00:59:30.220
I haven't even started.

886
00:59:30.286 --> 00:59:32.255
He won't give up on his fantasies.

887
00:59:32.322 --> 00:59:34.290
So he will kill again.
