<i>[This program is suitable
for viewers ages 15 and up.]</i>

3
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.703
Who... are you?

4
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:36.481
<i>Is there such a thing as fate?</i>

5
00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:40.984
<i>If there is,
I'm out of luck in this life.</i>

6
00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:45.259
<i>My life is way too tangled up.</i>

7
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.490
Yes, Big Brother.

8
00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:59.076
Please do this for me.

9
00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:00.670
Please help me.

10
00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.726
<i>Will I be able to find some hope?</i>

11
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:09.578
<i>In my life, nothing was ever easy.</i>

12
00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:11.711
<i>It was hard getting into college.</i>

13
00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:15.133
<i>And graduating was even harder.</i>

14
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:21.381
<i>- I found out later...</i>
- Number 13, Kang Sung Ho?

15
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.964
<i>that finding a job is the hardest part.</i>

16
00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:32.146
<i>[We're a family.]</i>

17
00:01:32.146 --> 00:01:35.247
<i>I barely managed to
get into a tiny company.</i>

18
00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:39.125
How could family fire one another?

19
00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:42.095
Hey, when will you stop living that way?

20
00:01:43.362 --> 00:01:47.163
I'll scout you,
so work for us as a chief.

21
00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:50.571
- A chief?
- You can be a director if you want.

22
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:53.562
Hey, I'm the president.
I can get you any position you want.

23
00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:59.136
Wow, but hey, what business do you run?

24
00:01:59.658 --> 00:02:03.202
Have you heard of anyone
getting rich by saving money?

25
00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:07.044
Have you ever heard of becoming
a business tycoon with life savings?

26
00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:10.604
That's not how you make money, everyone.

27
00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:16.561
We buy 500 coffee roasters
that cost 8 million won

28
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:19.321
and we lend them
to coffee establishments.

29
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:21.789
If you buy three, you'll become a chief.

30
00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.258
If you buy six,
you'll become a head chief.

31
00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:28.306
If you buy 9, you'll become
a director. If you buy 12...

32
00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:32.626
you will become a president,
with a formal business license.

33
00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:35.488
Who? That's right, you.

34
00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:42.158
Hey, if you invest 8 million won,
you can make 10 million a month.

35
00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:45.918
- Hey, do you want to die?
- Who says we can't be rich?

36
00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:48.625
You can be rich! I'm not interested!

37
00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:52.789
This is a great opportunity.
You'll probably thank me later.

38
00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.008
Build pyramids in Egypt, not in Korea!

39
00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:57.281
Hey.

40
00:02:58.323 --> 00:02:59.869
Move.

41
00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:03.864
Your friend wouldn't
bring you to a bad place.

42
00:03:03.864 --> 00:03:06.798
- Let go!
- Hey, come on.

43
00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:08.991
Are they fighting?

44
00:03:08.991 --> 00:03:11.656
- Stay for another hour.
- I'll report you to the police!

45
00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:14.509
If you leave like this,
you'll embarrass me.

46
00:03:15.293 --> 00:03:16.972
Please move out of the way.

47
00:03:16.972 --> 00:03:21.395
President Bong's friend
shouldn't act this way.

48
00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.889
Please go inside.

49
00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.396
Geez, what the heck?

50
00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:27.704
You're leaving, right?

51
00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:32.144
Geez, let's go.

52
00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:34.363
Hey, Kyung Jae.

53
00:03:34.363 --> 00:03:37.758
It's possible. I'm already
a president! I'm already...

54
00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:39.925
How can I trust you, you bastard?

55
00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.221
I'm taking the subway from here.

56
00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:09.666
Are you okay? Can you walk?

57
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.466
Geez, I only hurt my ankle.

58
00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:14.216
My legs are fine.

59
00:04:14.882 --> 00:04:18.022
Okay, then I'll get going.

60
00:04:18.022 --> 00:04:20.047
Thank you for today.

61
00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:22.301
Here.

62
00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:39.073
Excuse me!

63
00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.004
Can I give you my number?

64
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:51.640
I'll give it to you. It's 010 9102...

65
00:05:13.992 --> 00:05:16.489
I'm sorry! Are you okay? I'm sorry!

66
00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:18.888
Are you okay? What do we do?

67
00:05:18.888 --> 00:05:20.527
Does it hurt?

68
00:05:22.765 --> 00:05:24.957
It's 010...

69
00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:28.609
9102...

70
00:05:33.782 --> 00:05:35.575
<i>I liked her because she was pretty.</i>

71
00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:40.933
<i>I liked her because
she was kind and pretty.</i>

72
00:05:44.604 --> 00:05:47.566
- I want that.
<i>- I liked her because she was kind</i>

73
00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:49.383
<i>pretty, and honest.</i>

74
00:05:55.152 --> 00:05:57.676
Don't go on your computer
until late at night.

75
00:05:57.676 --> 00:05:59.794
And don't snack too much at night either.

76
00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:03.292
I'll go now. Goodnight.

77
00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:04.415
Wait.

78
00:06:07.102 --> 00:06:09.616
Do you want to eat chicken gizzard?

79
00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:34.594
<i>Nothing ever went my way until now.</i>

80
00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:41.201
<i>Love was the only thing that went my way.</i>

81
00:06:48.427 --> 00:06:52.397
<i>If I think about it,
love was the easiest.</i>

82
00:06:55.715 --> 00:07:04.460
<i>[Love is the easiest.]</i>

83
00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:17.838
Who... are you?

84
00:07:19.227 --> 00:07:20.780
I'm...

85
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.588
- Me?
- Who are you, really?

86
00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:31.823
I'm San Ma Ru.

87
00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:41.119
Who are you to do this to me?

88
00:07:42.049 --> 00:07:46.862
You're not important. You're just
a tourist who's here for three days.

89
00:07:46.862 --> 00:07:49.696
Why are you doing this to me
all of a sudden?

90
00:07:50.364 --> 00:07:53.789
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to put on the chastity belt.

91
00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:56.006
I did, but I didn't know
it'd turn out this way.

92
00:07:56.006 --> 00:07:59.042
But I'm not saying I should be
forgiven because I didn't know.

93
00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.679
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

94
00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:05.105
I'm not talking about the chastity belt!

95
00:08:06.427 --> 00:08:08.355
Then what is this about?

96
00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:13.460
<i>I'm saying... you're my destined love.</i>

97
00:08:18.263 --> 00:08:20.749
Meet me in the hotel lobby
at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning.

98
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:24.967
The others will start their day,
and you will head to the airport.

99
00:08:24.967 --> 00:08:26.523
I'll see you tomorrow.

100
00:08:32.908 --> 00:08:36.758
Something happened, right?
Are we banned? Were you scolded?

101
00:08:37.854 --> 00:08:40.598
Talk to me. How can I help?

102
00:08:46.189 --> 00:08:48.355
Something did happen.

103
00:08:48.355 --> 00:08:50.647
Nothing happened.

104
00:08:50.647 --> 00:08:55.143
I'll go see the mayor.
I'll fight, beg, or beat him up.

105
00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:57.416
I'll do everything I can
so you're not harmed.

106
00:08:57.416 --> 00:08:59.979
- Where are you going?
- To see the mayor.

107
00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:01.860
That's not it!

108
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.378
No, I'll take the responsibility.

109
00:09:06.773 --> 00:09:09.447
Ma Ru! San Ma Ru!

110
00:09:09.447 --> 00:09:13.259
It's not that way!
It's not that way either!

111
00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:17.055
It's this way. Follow me.

112
00:09:41.028 --> 00:09:43.115
Where are you going
when you don't know the way?

113
00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:45.499
Is the mayor waiting to see you?

114
00:09:45.499 --> 00:09:48.513
Do you think he'll
invite you in for a chat?

115
00:09:48.513 --> 00:09:52.104
You can't speak French.
What will you say to him?

116
00:09:52.104 --> 00:09:53.505
I didn't think that far ahead.

117
00:09:53.505 --> 00:09:56.141
But it's my responsibility,
so I'll take care of it.

118
00:09:56.141 --> 00:09:59.314
I'm... a guide.

119
00:09:59.314 --> 00:10:04.368
The tourists are under my responsibility
during their stay here, including you.

120
00:10:04.368 --> 00:10:08.613
So please behave while you're here
and make it easier for me.

121
00:10:09.204 --> 00:10:11.130
I'm not an irresponsible person.

122
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.154
He could be going home soon. Let's hurry.

123
00:10:37.119 --> 00:10:39.258
<i>I don't even know why we fought.</i>

124
00:10:40.334 --> 00:10:43.321
Hey, you're smellier. Go take a poop.

125
00:10:44.404 --> 00:10:47.585
<i>- It wasn't worth fighting over.</i>
- Yes, Big Brother!

126
00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:49.190
Fine, go back.

127
00:10:58.488 --> 00:11:01.874
<i>Fighting and making up
became a daily routine.</i>

128
00:11:07.384 --> 00:11:10.687
<i>There's nothing special about love.</i>

129
00:11:10.687 --> 00:11:13.413
That's what he said to me.

130
00:11:13.413 --> 00:11:15.662
<i>We eat together.</i>

131
00:11:15.662 --> 00:11:18.634
- Let's eat!
<i>- We cook together.</i>

132
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.920
- Enjoy.
<i>- We order delivery.</i>

133
00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:27.173
<i>- Or we don't eat at all.</i>
- Huh?

134
00:11:27.173 --> 00:11:30.537
What's wrong this time?
Where are you going?

135
00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:34.709
- Geez, it took so long...
<i>- We cooked for one another.</i>

136
00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:38.344
<i>And cleaned up afterward.</i>

137
00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:44.277
<i>Love is also a part of making a living.</i>

138
00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:49.937
<i>It's just that making a living
is the hardest thing in the world.</i>

139
00:12:09.247 --> 00:12:11.185
<i>It doesn't even startle me anymore.</i>

140
00:12:18.767 --> 00:12:21.415
- Did you eat?
- I'm not hungry.

141
00:12:23.031 --> 00:12:25.301
Hey, I bought wine.

142
00:12:27.268 --> 00:12:28.763
I bought this wine...

143
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:34.168
coconut oil for constipation...

144
00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:38.143
and these cookies that are
supposed to bring good fortune.

145
00:12:38.869 --> 00:12:40.374
I'm not interested.

146
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.215
Geez, seriously.

147
00:12:54.412 --> 00:12:57.888
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

148
00:12:58.671 --> 00:13:00.088
Forgive me.

149
00:13:00.874 --> 00:13:03.606
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

150
00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:07.194
Hey, I said, I'm sorry.

151
00:13:09.412 --> 00:13:12.297
Hey, why are you acting like this?

152
00:13:12.297 --> 00:13:14.630
Do you have to do this in France?

153
00:13:19.725 --> 00:13:22.981
Hey, hey, hey! I bought wine,
so don't open that!

154
00:13:22.981 --> 00:13:25.207
Hey! Hey!

155
00:13:25.207 --> 00:13:27.662
You're the one who's ruining the trip.

156
00:13:27.662 --> 00:13:29.547
You were annoyed
and on the phone all day!

157
00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:33.763
Are you saying sorry
because you're actually sorry?

158
00:13:39.744 --> 00:13:43.216
<i>Our future depends on it,
so what else could I do?</i>

159
00:13:45.047 --> 00:13:49.548
We'll introduce it as
"Smart City," or "All City."

160
00:13:49.548 --> 00:13:53.485
If we're lucky, we can get at least 10

161
00:13:53.485 --> 00:13:56.086
to a maximum of 30.

162
00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:59.373
- You mean...
- Three billion won.

163
00:13:59.373 --> 00:14:01.296
Including the processing fee.

164
00:14:03.168 --> 00:14:06.211
That's not all. I'll give
the company a share too.

165
00:14:06.211 --> 00:14:11.189
Don't worry about the investments,
and focus on growing the company.

166
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:16.192
And I'll invest 30 million won,
so use that for your operation costs.

167
00:14:16.192 --> 00:14:19.960
- Thank you, Senior.
- Call me Big Brother.

168
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.091
Yes, Big Brother.

169
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:25.277
And, by the way

170
00:14:25.277 --> 00:14:29.441
do you think I'll get the investments
by mid-next month?

171
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:33.195
Probably. Why? Is it urgent?

172
00:14:33.195 --> 00:14:37.277
It's my seventh anniversary
with my girlfriend next month.

173
00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:40.195
Geez, what a loyal couple you are.

174
00:14:40.195 --> 00:14:45.534
Yes, so I wanted to take her
on vacation and prepare an event

175
00:14:45.534 --> 00:14:47.450
so I can propose.

176
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.305
Yeah, a man needs a house to get married.

177
00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:53.989
If you get the investments,
marriage is no trouble at all.

178
00:14:53.989 --> 00:14:55.358
Yes.

179
00:14:55.358 --> 00:14:59.353
<i>"Thank you for waiting so long.
Let's get married."</i>

180
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.125
<i>"I got the investments,
and the business will go well."</i>

181
00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:05.404
<i>"I won't give you a hard time."</i>

182
00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:09.332
<i>I brought you here because
I wanted to tell you that.</i>

183
00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:15.026
Yes, Big Brother.
You said we'd find out by today.

184
00:15:16.995 --> 00:15:18.287
It's not going to work?

185
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.524
That's not it.

186
00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:31.767
Big Brother, you said we'd get at least
one billion won. How could you do this?

187
00:15:34.182 --> 00:15:37.878
Senior, I'm begging you.

188
00:15:37.878 --> 00:15:42.993
I'm fine with 300 to 400 million won,
so give me some breathing room.

189
00:15:42.993 --> 00:15:47.297
You can double the processing fee

190
00:15:47.297 --> 00:15:49.133
and I'll give you a larger share.

191
00:15:50.109 --> 00:15:51.413
Yes.

192
00:15:53.715 --> 00:15:56.691
<i>It turns out...
nothing ever works out for me.</i>

193
00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:01.119
<i>So can't you go easy on me?</i>

194
00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:04.286
<i>Can't you comfort me?</i>

195
00:16:04.286 --> 00:16:07.718
- I'm going to sleep.
- Hey, So Ran.

196
00:16:08.662 --> 00:16:13.043
It was a call from the senior who
was going to connect me with investors.

197
00:16:13.043 --> 00:16:15.960
- I had no choice but to answer...
- I don't want to hear it.

198
00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:23.916
If this works out, we'll be problem-free.

199
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:30.604
I know it's difficult,
but this is for our future.

200
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.322
I'm sick of this.

201
00:16:46.108 --> 00:16:47.665
<i>I'm lonely.</i>

202
00:17:15.975 --> 00:17:18.013
Why did you come here?

203
00:17:18.013 --> 00:17:21.445
Why did you come to France of all places?

204
00:17:21.445 --> 00:17:23.656
Flights to Italy were sold out.

205
00:17:24.734 --> 00:17:28.118
Why did you come alone?
You have a girlfriend.

206
00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:32.023
- We fought.
- That's why you came alone?

207
00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:35.387
My girlfriend didn't come to the airport.

208
00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:37.313
On the day of departure?

209
00:17:37.313 --> 00:17:39.456
Without notice?

210
00:17:41.917 --> 00:17:44.045
How did you fight?

211
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.481
I did nothing wrong.

212
00:17:47.481 --> 00:17:51.617
All men say this.
They say they did nothing wrong.

213
00:17:52.461 --> 00:17:54.776
I really did nothing wrong.

214
00:17:55.392 --> 00:17:57.305
You don't know why we fought.

215
00:17:57.305 --> 00:18:00.588
The process of fighting
is when women get hurt the most.

216
00:18:00.588 --> 00:18:04.990
So how you fight is important.
But not to most men.

217
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.918
To them, why they fought
is the most important.

218
00:18:06.918 --> 00:18:09.637
- That's not always true.
- For example

219
00:18:09.637 --> 00:18:14.180
let's say you fought with your
girlfriend, so you drank with a friend.

220
00:18:14.721 --> 00:18:17.509
She hasn't been answering my calls
because we fought yesterday.

221
00:18:17.509 --> 00:18:19.413
Then what does your friend say?

222
00:18:19.413 --> 00:18:25.572
Why? Why did you fight?
Then, did you win or lose?

223
00:18:25.572 --> 00:18:27.065
Isn't that right?

224
00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:31.676
- I guess.
- If it were my friend...

225
00:18:40.743 --> 00:18:42.952
How did you fight?

226
00:18:42.952 --> 00:18:46.068
<i>Wait, what did she say?</i>

227
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.903
I fought with Evian...

228
00:18:53.771 --> 00:18:56.690
so he left the house.

229
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.029
How did you fight?

230
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:04.869
Don't just think about why you fought.
Think about how you fought, too.

231
00:19:04.869 --> 00:19:08.551
Think about it and see
if you're still not at fault.

232
00:19:12.157 --> 00:19:16.267
You're right. I hadn't thought that far.

233
00:19:24.628 --> 00:19:26.514
I did nothing wrong.

234
00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:58.711
Why did you fight?

235
00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:00.813
There was a problem at work.

236
00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:04.494
I thought we'd think the same way.

237
00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:07.365
Was anyone ever rewarded for
uncovering a company's corruption?

238
00:20:07.365 --> 00:20:11.490
Yeah, in the United States
and Europe, they reward them...

239
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.016
Not in the United States
or Europe, but in Korea.

240
00:20:14.016 --> 00:20:16.189
Was anyone rewarded in Korea?

241
00:20:18.782 --> 00:20:20.185
Anyone?

242
00:20:21.281 --> 00:20:24.693
- In the future.
- Maybe, but not now.

243
00:20:24.693 --> 00:20:28.157
You'll be punished for stabbing them
in the back, dooming you in society.

244
00:20:28.157 --> 00:20:31.550
You won't get another job.
You'll be a loser forever.

245
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.878
- That's the reality.
- The reality isn't right.

246
00:20:33.878 --> 00:20:37.108
Isn't it also wrong... to ignore reality?

247
00:20:37.108 --> 00:20:41.136
<i>I reported it to the section chief,
and an investigation began</i>

248
00:20:41.136 --> 00:20:43.110
<i>but they only investigated me.</i>

249
00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:46.367
You were planning to
bring the company down.

250
00:20:46.367 --> 00:20:48.013
How did you get these documents?

251
00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:52.155
It's illegal to access secret documents
with your superior's ID and password.

252
00:20:52.155 --> 00:20:55.169
Who told you to do it?
I'm sure it was someone.

253
00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:58.713
- Where's the file?
- Where's the file?

254
00:20:58.713 --> 00:21:03.283
I left for my vacation the next day.
And my girlfriend didn't come.

255
00:21:03.283 --> 00:21:07.617
You were brave to take
a vacation in that situation.

256
00:21:07.617 --> 00:21:09.972
I might have run away.

257
00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:13.754
Is that why you're going to go back?

258
00:21:13.754 --> 00:21:16.262
Will it change anything?

259
00:21:16.262 --> 00:21:19.243
Absence without leave isn't right.

260
00:21:19.243 --> 00:21:23.631
Vacation isn't a company benefit,
but the employee's right.

261
00:21:23.631 --> 00:21:27.590
Aren't you giving up your future
if you give that up?

262
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.099
I wish she could have said that.

263
00:21:30.099 --> 00:21:36.125
But I can't live with someone
who gave up on his future.

264
00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:40.090
- What do you mean?
- This is what they say in our country.

265
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:44.061
If you play and rest all you want,
you won't have a future.

266
00:21:44.061 --> 00:21:46.515
But you're saying the opposite.

267
00:21:46.515 --> 00:21:50.186
- If I only work, I'll have no future.
- You'll have a future at the company.

268
00:21:50.186 --> 00:21:52.907
But it's quite strange, isn't it?

269
00:21:52.907 --> 00:21:55.740
We only think that the company
is keeping us alive.

270
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.153
We never think that we're keeping
the company alive.

271
00:21:59.153 --> 00:22:00.711
Why do you think that is?

272
00:22:00.711 --> 00:22:04.519
No matter how much we feed
companies, they're never full.

273
00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:06.358
It's strange.

274
00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:11.019
The company isn't an enemy or a friend.

275
00:22:11.019 --> 00:22:14.115
You can't betray them,
but you can't trust them either.

276
00:22:14.115 --> 00:22:17.972
But one thing's for sure.
You did nothing wrong.

277
00:22:18.569 --> 00:22:21.538
You're the first person to say that.

278
00:22:21.538 --> 00:22:23.894
You did the right thing.

279
00:22:23.894 --> 00:22:28.910
So don't go back as if
you've done something wrong.

280
00:22:58.111 --> 00:23:01.878
Who told you to slam the door?
I ended up leaking everywhere!

281
00:23:01.878 --> 00:23:05.898
I told you to close the door
when you pee! You're like a dog!

282
00:23:05.898 --> 00:23:09.154
A dog? A dog?

283
00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:10.958
You can't say that!

284
00:23:21.629 --> 00:23:23.645
- I'm sorry.
- What's wrong?

285
00:23:23.645 --> 00:23:25.582
Did you fight with that woman?

286
00:23:25.582 --> 00:23:28.903
Why are you getting annoyed at me?

287
00:23:28.903 --> 00:23:32.542
I knew this would happen since you
asked me to come on this secret trip.

288
00:23:32.542 --> 00:23:34.723
I didn't get annoyed.

289
00:23:34.723 --> 00:23:37.251
I'm annoyed.

290
00:23:40.369 --> 00:23:41.644
I'm sorry.

291
00:23:41.644 --> 00:23:44.696
I'll close the door from now on.

292
00:23:44.696 --> 00:23:47.427
- Are you happy?
- No.

293
00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:49.766
Pay a fine of 100,000 won.

294
00:23:49.766 --> 00:23:53.629
Wow, you only talk about money.

295
00:23:53.629 --> 00:23:58.082
Do you think it's wasteful? You said
you'd pay me as much as you love me.

296
00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:03.644
I don't think it's wasteful at all.
It's never a waste on you.

297
00:24:03.644 --> 00:24:05.618
You're so cute.

298
00:24:07.628 --> 00:24:10.044
100,000 won is 70 euros.

299
00:24:10.044 --> 00:24:13.639
- Give me 80 euros.
- I don't want to.

300
00:24:13.639 --> 00:24:15.261
I'll give you 100 euros.

301
00:24:16.013 --> 00:24:19.436
- Thank you.
- You're so cute.

302
00:24:22.437 --> 00:24:25.148
I'm still annoyed,
so I want some time alone.

303
00:24:29.474 --> 00:24:31.260
Yeah, I got it.

304
00:24:41.538 --> 00:24:45.034
I told you to dress warm.
Why did you catch a cold?

305
00:24:45.034 --> 00:24:48.725
It's not a cold. It's just phlegm.

306
00:24:48.725 --> 00:24:50.669
Phlegm? Yeah, right.

307
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:54.292
You should have come back early!

308
00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:57.043
Why did you stay out so late?

309
00:24:57.043 --> 00:25:00.475
- That's why you're sick!
- We came all the way here

310
00:25:00.475 --> 00:25:02.398
so I wanted to sightsee...

311
00:25:07.511 --> 00:25:09.765
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

312
00:25:10.987 --> 00:25:13.657
- Take your medicine.
- Yeah.

313
00:25:13.657 --> 00:25:16.045
Gosh, I'll take it.

314
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.860
You should worry about
your health before medicine.

315
00:25:23.515 --> 00:25:26.311
Your medicine won't help...

316
00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:29.571
Geez, this woman.

317
00:26:00.035 --> 00:26:02.506
I know the way. I can go on my own.

318
00:26:02.506 --> 00:26:06.830
I said you're my responsibility
until you leave France.

319
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.937
Aren't you tired?

320
00:26:38.984 --> 00:26:40.974
Why did you stare at it for so long?

321
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.062
I don't know when I'll be back.

322
00:26:44.062 --> 00:26:47.746
I'm sad. I really like this place.

323
00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:51.769
I hate this place.

324
00:26:52.524 --> 00:26:56.395
Why? You said this is
the best place in France.

325
00:27:05.588 --> 00:27:08.050
Did you hear about
the long-living banana?

326
00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:13.625
They put one banana on the floor,
and hung one banana from the ceiling.

327
00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:19.480
The banana on the floor
realized it died, and turned black.

328
00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.544
But the banana in the air
thought it was still alive

329
00:27:23.544 --> 00:27:25.737
so it stayed fresh.

330
00:27:25.737 --> 00:27:28.115
I feel that way every time I come here.

331
00:27:28.684 --> 00:27:32.186
I was the banana
hanging from the ceiling.

332
00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:37.615
I already died, but I deluded myself
into thinking I was alive, and endured.

333
00:27:38.126 --> 00:27:40.351
Hey, that's...

334
00:27:40.351 --> 00:27:42.707
a load of bananas.

335
00:27:45.108 --> 00:27:49.100
I... got married here.

336
00:27:53.696 --> 00:27:56.868
You... got married?

337
00:27:56.868 --> 00:27:58.215
Yes.

338
00:27:59.745 --> 00:28:01.396
Right over there.

339
00:28:02.474 --> 00:28:05.936
Wait, was it there?

340
00:28:07.145 --> 00:28:08.955
I don't remember that either.

341
00:28:13.232 --> 00:28:15.501
Congratulations on your marriage.

342
00:28:23.052 --> 00:28:26.240
I ran away from home with that man.

343
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.504
I didn't even have a wedding dress,
anyone's blessing

344
00:28:33.504 --> 00:28:35.674
or anyone to curse at us.

345
00:28:35.674 --> 00:28:37.987
It was just the two of us.

346
00:28:40.423 --> 00:28:44.530
I think I wore a white dress.

347
00:28:45.589 --> 00:28:48.378
<i>What was he wearing?</i>

348
00:28:50.505 --> 00:28:52.753
I don't remember that either.

349
00:28:53.985 --> 00:28:55.891
I really don't.

350
00:28:55.891 --> 00:28:59.977
I don't remember his face,
or the sound of his breathing.

351
00:29:00.717 --> 00:29:02.611
I forgot everything.

352
00:29:04.755 --> 00:29:06.888
That man...

353
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.119
<i>Was he...</i>

354
00:29:11.119 --> 00:29:13.505
<i>But that bastard...</i>

355
00:29:13.505 --> 00:29:17.455
No, I ran away.

356
00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:21.300
I ran away far away from him.

357
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:25.080
I ran away so far
that I forgot about him.

358
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.407
I can't get caught. I did nothing wrong.

359
00:29:29.917 --> 00:29:32.752
I didn't want to come here, but...

360
00:29:32.752 --> 00:29:37.678
"This is the most beautiful place
in the world made by God's revelation"

361
00:29:37.678 --> 00:29:40.929
"and human belief, everyone."

362
00:29:41.937 --> 00:29:45.792
This is what I'm doing, like a fool.

363
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.885
I finally managed to run away from here

364
00:30:02.885 --> 00:30:05.542
but they said
I'd meet my true love here.

365
00:30:06.961 --> 00:30:10.062
At the statue of
Saint Michael the Archangel.

366
00:30:10.062 --> 00:30:13.484
- Isn't that funny?
- You won't meet him, then.

367
00:30:13.484 --> 00:30:15.741
You can't go up there.

368
00:30:15.741 --> 00:30:18.063
What if I can?

369
00:30:18.063 --> 00:30:21.328
- Then you'll meet him.
- Do you think so?

370
00:30:22.205 --> 00:30:24.058
If you believe in destiny.

371
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.167
I don't believe in that.
It's all nonsense.

372
00:30:29.167 --> 00:30:32.288
I become friends
with the tourists on their last day.

373
00:30:32.288 --> 00:30:36.011
It seems like I said a lot of nonsense.

374
00:30:39.994 --> 00:30:41.348
Shall we go now?

375
00:30:42.156 --> 00:30:45.097
Is that why you kept
riding the merry-go-round?

376
00:30:46.274 --> 00:30:47.634
Pardon?

377
00:30:49.015 --> 00:30:52.977
No matter how long you ride it,
you come back to the same place.

378
00:30:52.977 --> 00:30:57.587
The same place and time
you've wanted to come back to.

379
00:30:57.587 --> 00:30:59.525
Isn't that why you ride it?

380
00:30:59.525 --> 00:31:01.849
I ride it to pass the time.

381
00:31:01.849 --> 00:31:05.936
Then don't cry. If you cry,
you can't start over.

382
00:31:05.936 --> 00:31:09.886
Don't blame yourself,
and when your destined love appears

383
00:31:09.886 --> 00:31:13.320
blame him for showing up so late.

384
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.831
Okay?

385
00:31:16.327 --> 00:31:18.712
I don't believe in destiny though.

386
00:31:18.712 --> 00:31:21.859
You'll meet a cool man,
even if you don't believe in it.

387
00:31:21.859 --> 00:31:25.350
Because you're a cool woman.

388
00:31:45.374 --> 00:31:48.606
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E05 The Package</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

389
00:31:57.074 --> 00:32:00.367
<i>Women often make mistakes
when they're lonely.</i>

390
00:32:05.188 --> 00:32:07.247
<i>Men do that too.</i>

391
00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:14.097
<i>At times, the mistake is caused
by the desire to make a mistake.</i>

392
00:32:26.365 --> 00:32:28.386
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

393
00:32:28.386 --> 00:32:30.718
You could have used your words
instead of your bottle.

394
00:32:30.718 --> 00:32:32.811
My mouth was occupied though.

395
00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:41.241
<i>At times, "mistake" is a cowardly word
we use to hide our true feelings.</i>

396
00:32:42.818 --> 00:32:45.680
I'm sorry. I made a mistake...

397
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.407
I made a mistake too.

398
00:32:48.626 --> 00:32:51.648
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you.

399
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.640
I'm crazy. I've lost it.

400
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.728
- So So!
- I'm going crazy.

401
00:32:59.649 --> 00:33:01.129
Wait!

402
00:33:02.103 --> 00:33:04.033
You forgot your bag!

403
00:33:04.033 --> 00:33:08.475
So So! Slow down! Your bag!

404
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.487
- Don't you have to go back upstairs?
- Hey, if you're a man

405
00:33:17.487 --> 00:33:20.321
it's all over after you
close the door and leave.

406
00:33:20.321 --> 00:33:23.936
Your woman has to run over
and apologize on her knees

407
00:33:23.936 --> 00:33:27.550
with her head down before you go
back into the room. Don't you agree?

408
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:28.597
Yes.

409
00:33:28.597 --> 00:33:32.368
But... is your travel partner
your girlfriend or your daughter?

410
00:33:33.215 --> 00:33:36.860
She's like a daughter who's my
girlfriend, and the other way around.

411
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.589
It's a mess.

412
00:33:43.706 --> 00:33:45.699
Isn't the beer bland?

413
00:33:45.699 --> 00:33:48.802
In France, all the food
and drinks are bland.

414
00:33:50.843 --> 00:33:52.775
Would you like to go full out?

415
00:34:03.587 --> 00:34:05.667
This is called a "Wine Bomb."

416
00:34:05.667 --> 00:34:09.581
30 percent white wine and 70 percent
red wine creates a strong flavor.

417
00:34:09.581 --> 00:34:13.439
Wow, I learned something important today.

418
00:34:13.439 --> 00:34:16.294
Give it to me. I'll pour you a glass.

419
00:34:16.294 --> 00:34:17.517
Here.

420
00:34:19.564 --> 00:34:21.003
What are you doing?

421
00:34:21.003 --> 00:34:22.849
Yes, pour it for me.

422
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:26.267
I'm an elder. You're being so rude.

423
00:34:26.267 --> 00:34:28.956
You don't know drinking
etiquette. Use two hands.

424
00:34:28.956 --> 00:34:33.070
No, this is how you're
supposed to receive wine.

425
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:37.419
It doesn't matter what drink it is.
You can't receive it with one hand.

426
00:34:37.419 --> 00:34:40.325
Drinking etiquette doesn't differ
depending on drinks. Use both hands.

427
00:34:40.325 --> 00:34:42.046
Sure, I apologize.

428
00:34:42.928 --> 00:34:46.392
You should have done
that from the start. Here.

429
00:34:46.392 --> 00:34:47.923
This is 30 percent.

430
00:34:47.923 --> 00:34:50.307
And this is 70 percent.

431
00:34:50.307 --> 00:34:54.207
- That's enough, sir.
- Hey, it's better when it's full.

432
00:34:56.057 --> 00:34:59.173
- Yes, thank you.
- Ready?

433
00:35:01.553 --> 00:35:04.437
We have to chug our first glass, sir.

434
00:35:04.437 --> 00:35:08.367
Sounds good! Let's make
a drinking wave. Cheers!

435
00:35:08.367 --> 00:35:09.695
Cheers!

436
00:35:10.144 --> 00:35:11.691
Aren't you going to cheers?

437
00:35:12.412 --> 00:35:15.102
- Yes, I will.
- Again.

438
00:35:15.102 --> 00:35:17.457
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

439
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:32.950
<i>Today is an especially
pitiful day in my life.</i>

440
00:35:34.097 --> 00:35:36.108
<i>Although, it was always pitiful.</i>

441
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.566
Hey.

442
00:35:40.274 --> 00:35:42.762
Who taught you to glare at your man?

443
00:35:42.762 --> 00:35:45.548
Mom, why are you getting mad at me?

444
00:35:45.548 --> 00:35:49.341
- Is it red?
- Hey, it's not red.

445
00:35:50.164 --> 00:35:51.832
It's not bleeding. You won't die.

446
00:35:51.832 --> 00:35:53.742
I don't know. I'm annoyed.

447
00:35:54.963 --> 00:35:56.753
Geez, seriously.

448
00:36:00.169 --> 00:36:05.164
You did nothing wrong. You should
fool around and live a fun life.

449
00:36:06.682 --> 00:36:10.157
By the way, when are you
going to get married?

450
00:36:16.988 --> 00:36:21.271
It's not good to make
a woman wait too long.

451
00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:25.633
Yes, of course, Mother.

452
00:36:25.633 --> 00:36:27.948
<i>That's when I promised myself</i>

453
00:36:27.948 --> 00:36:30.615
<i>that I wouldn't make her wait any longer.</i>

454
00:37:01.367 --> 00:37:03.573
Drink! Drink! Drink!

455
00:37:03.573 --> 00:37:06.474
Hey, Kids! Kids! Kids!

456
00:37:06.474 --> 00:37:09.276
Drink! Drink! You should drink! Enjoy it!

457
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.876
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

458
00:37:41.062 --> 00:37:42.919
<i>I was rude.</i>

459
00:38:08.932 --> 00:38:11.503
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

460
00:38:11.503 --> 00:38:14.501
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

461
00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:17.122
We will complete yesterday's
schedule in the morning

462
00:38:17.122 --> 00:38:20.195
and you'll have free time
in the afternoon.

463
00:38:20.195 --> 00:38:24.070
San Ma Ru will go back to Korea
today because of work.

464
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:27.983
We've gotten close on this trip.
Aren't you sad?

465
00:38:27.983 --> 00:38:29.189
Yes.

466
00:38:32.481 --> 00:38:34.970
Then, let's get on the bus.

467
00:38:40.769 --> 00:38:43.644
The rental car is here. You can go now.

468
00:38:43.644 --> 00:38:44.921
Okay.

469
00:38:53.307 --> 00:38:55.403
Please come this way.

470
00:38:56.099 --> 00:38:58.454
- Are you going back to work?
- Yes.

471
00:38:58.454 --> 00:39:01.376
You're a good man.

472
00:39:01.376 --> 00:39:07.224
When I worked at a company...
When was it? During the 1988 Olympics?

473
00:39:07.224 --> 00:39:12.146
Back then, our athletes won
12 medals after only eating ramen.

474
00:39:12.146 --> 00:39:16.329
That's the kind of mindset
we need to bring back in Korea.

475
00:39:17.753 --> 00:39:20.802
- It's a pharmaceutical company, right?
- Yes.

476
00:39:20.802 --> 00:39:23.579
You have a lot of cancer
medicine there, right?

477
00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:25.102
Cancer medicine?

478
00:39:25.878 --> 00:39:29.213
- Anticancer drugs?
- That's the one!

479
00:39:29.213 --> 00:39:31.981
You must have good medicine
that hasn't been released yet.

480
00:39:31.981 --> 00:39:35.099
The kind that cures cancer
and brings back appetites.

481
00:39:35.099 --> 00:39:38.070
But that's not what
our department works with.

482
00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.260
Please look for it anyway. If you help me

483
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.332
I'll treat you as
our VIP customer forever.

484
00:39:44.332 --> 00:39:48.048
- I'll call you in Korea.
- Okay.

485
00:39:53.669 --> 00:39:58.499
Thank you for everything.
And I'm sorry in many ways.

486
00:39:58.499 --> 00:40:00.747
If you get a call...

487
00:40:00.747 --> 00:40:03.675
Yes, that's fine. Call me anytime.

488
00:40:03.675 --> 00:40:07.171
Not me, but the
travel agency's call center.

489
00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:12.195
If they ask you to rate your
satisfaction, please give me a 10.

490
00:40:12.195 --> 00:40:14.229
I'll give you a 10.

491
00:40:14.229 --> 00:40:17.195
Thank you. Travel safely.

492
00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:38.829
Ma Ru is getting on the plane today.

493
00:40:39.439 --> 00:40:42.428
I bet he won't come today either.

494
00:40:42.428 --> 00:40:45.733
He'll drag it out and attack us
when we have our guard down.

495
00:40:45.733 --> 00:40:49.878
Who can guarantee he's not
talking to reporters there?

496
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.291
He wouldn't do that.

497
00:40:52.291 --> 00:40:55.300
Even if we can block
the media from talking

498
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.180
what if he hands it over
to another business?

499
00:40:58.461 --> 00:41:01.019
Do you have proof he doesn't
have the documents?

500
00:41:01.019 --> 00:41:04.972
He doesn't have anything to hand over.
I collected all the documents

501
00:41:04.972 --> 00:41:08.499
- and I don't think he has the file.
- If he does...

502
00:41:09.559 --> 00:41:14.216
who will take the responsibility
if he attacks us with it?

503
00:41:14.709 --> 00:41:18.106
The CEO? The president?

504
00:41:18.106 --> 00:41:19.861
No way.

505
00:41:20.465 --> 00:41:24.762
The section chief, me,
and you will suffer for it.

506
00:41:25.626 --> 00:41:28.329
- You know that, right?
- Yes.

507
00:41:28.329 --> 00:41:31.271
We could get used and fired too.

508
00:41:33.501 --> 00:41:34.995
Did you search everywhere?

509
00:41:35.847 --> 00:41:37.729
I did.

510
00:41:37.729 --> 00:41:43.073
His computer, his server,
and his computer at home.

511
00:42:06.472 --> 00:42:09.985
Isn't it fascinating? That's my first
laptop I bought with my part-time job.

512
00:42:09.985 --> 00:42:11.979
You still have this?

513
00:42:14.416 --> 00:42:18.289
This is my time capsule.
All my secrets are on it.

514
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.416
I'll get going first, Chief.

515
00:42:28.997 --> 00:42:30.117
Come here.

516
00:43:11.068 --> 00:43:13.396
Why is everyone seated this way?

517
00:43:13.396 --> 00:43:15.778
You didn't fight last night, did you?

518
00:43:17.164 --> 00:43:21.570
Almost everyone fights by the fourth day.

519
00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:26.048
But I have very surprising
and good news for you today.

520
00:43:26.048 --> 00:43:31.387
We will be the first group to go up to
the Saint Michael the Archangel statue.

521
00:43:31.387 --> 00:43:34.394
It has never been shown
to average tourists

522
00:43:34.394 --> 00:43:37.267
and it won't be in the future either.

523
00:43:37.267 --> 00:43:41.869
Aren't you excited to go up
to the closest place to Heaven?

524
00:43:41.869 --> 00:43:43.669
Really?

525
00:43:52.332 --> 00:43:54.782
It's surprising, indeed.

526
00:43:54.782 --> 00:43:57.523
Are we supposed to walk up there?

527
00:43:58.104 --> 00:44:01.023
- Are you going?
- Of course.

528
00:44:01.023 --> 00:44:04.091
- It's closest to Heaven.
- Geez.

529
00:44:04.091 --> 00:44:06.233
It's just another observatory.

530
00:44:06.233 --> 00:44:09.213
It's windy and cold up there.
Just stay here.

531
00:44:09.213 --> 00:44:11.644
Gosh, I'm going up.

532
00:44:11.644 --> 00:44:15.812
- I told you to stay.
- I'm going up.

533
00:44:15.812 --> 00:44:17.878
Are you crazy?

534
00:44:19.311 --> 00:44:21.590
Okay, let's go up.

535
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.195
- Yes.
- Huh?

536
00:44:25.267 --> 00:44:26.604
Let's go.

537
00:44:29.642 --> 00:44:31.992
It'd be nice to go up together

538
00:44:31.992 --> 00:44:36.303
but there's a limit for safety
and cultural reasons.

539
00:44:36.303 --> 00:44:39.300
First, you two will come up with me

540
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:44.615
and you can go up after we come down.
Are you okay with going up last?

541
00:44:44.615 --> 00:44:47.079
Yes, we don't mind.

542
00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:51.247
If you get tired, let me know
so we can take a break.

543
00:44:51.247 --> 00:44:52.740
Let's go.

544
00:44:53.631 --> 00:44:55.030
You can do it, sir.

545
00:45:26.173 --> 00:45:29.512
<i>[Your computer is in use.
Would you like remote access?]</i>

546

547
00:45:56.432 --> 00:45:58.097
Hey.

548
00:45:58.097 --> 00:46:00.673
- Where are you?
- Home.

549
00:46:00.673 --> 00:46:02.115
Whose home?

550
00:46:04.916 --> 00:46:08.412
- Did you leave yet?
- Are you going through my computer?

551
00:46:09.148 --> 00:46:10.517
Yeah.

552
00:46:11.675 --> 00:46:15.724
Did the company tell you
to find the file and erase it?

553
00:46:15.724 --> 00:46:18.751
Come back. Let's talk then.

554
00:46:25.925 --> 00:46:29.434
You're going to look through everything
from the most recent file, right?

555
00:46:30.026 --> 00:46:31.461
Yeah.

556
00:46:32.227 --> 00:46:33.887
Then, you'll find it.

557
00:46:35.133 --> 00:46:39.041
Probably. It'll take some time though.

558
00:46:39.041 --> 00:46:41.410
I used steganography.

559
00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:44.099
Erase it if you want. But...

560
00:46:44.979 --> 00:46:50.135
you'll have to remember
what you're about to erase.

561
00:47:30.274 --> 00:47:31.590
<i>I'll take it now.</i>

562
00:47:32.186 --> 00:47:35.128
One, two, three.

563
00:47:40.361 --> 00:47:42.733
This is crazy.

564
00:47:42.733 --> 00:47:45.689
- Why?
- It turned out perfectly.

565
00:47:45.689 --> 00:47:48.434
- Let's frame it.
- Sure.

What is it?

Why are you crying? Go back down.

I never told you anything.

You said you needed to send a car
for an early leaver by 1 p.m.

582
00:51:49.724 --> 00:51:50.968
I did?

I don't think So So went there.

584
00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:57.740

00:55:03.758 --> 00:55:05.035
Look!

How did you get back?

I turned the car around.

617

You asked me not to leave.

I swear, I'll remember your face.
You'd better watch out.

Why are you so late?

620

It's time to go back down.

It was so high up there
that I was scared.

622
00:57:23.496 --> 00:57:25.717
You should have held my hand.

623
00:57:25.717 --> 00:57:28.447
It was scary just standing up there.

624
00:57:28.447 --> 00:57:31.835
I wonder how scared the builders were.

625
00:57:31.835 --> 00:57:36.447
How did they lift so many rocks
without a fork crane?

00:57:37.643 --> 00:57:40.942
It's not a fork crane, but a tower crane.

627
00:57:40.942 --> 00:57:44.569
Anyway, it would have been scary.

628
00:57:44.569 --> 00:57:48.083
I couldn't even dream of doing it myself.

629
00:57:48.083 --> 00:57:51.096
That's true.
You get scared pretty easily.

630
00:57:51.096 --> 00:57:53.152
That's why you can't watch horror movies.

631
00:57:53.152 --> 00:57:57.650
I guess there's nothing
we can't do if we overcome our fears.

632
00:57:58.687 --> 00:58:03.196
Yeah, that's why people go to boot camp.

633
00:58:04.091 --> 00:58:08.757
That's why I thought about
why we're still dating.

634
00:58:09.464 --> 00:58:12.034
Maybe we're not dating
because we love each other.

635
00:58:12.685 --> 00:58:16.306
Maybe we're just too scared to break up.

636
00:58:18.886 --> 00:58:21.063
What do you mean?

637
00:58:22.591 --> 00:58:24.257
It's exactly how it sounds.

638
00:58:25.359 --> 00:58:27.281
Right now...

639
00:58:28.324 --> 00:58:30.179
we don't love each other.

640
00:58:32.116 --> 00:58:35.078
We're just scared of breaking up.

641
00:58:41.125 --> 00:58:45.127
Should we... break up now?

642
00:58:48.594 --> 00:58:51.243
<i>How can she look so calm?</i>

643
00:58:51.976 --> 00:58:54.257
<i>As if there's nothing more to fear...</i>

644
00:58:58.851 --> 00:59:00.393
Hey, Yoon So So!

645
00:59:12.355 --> 00:59:14.004
Please wait.

646
00:59:19.315 --> 00:59:21.583
<i>I ran away.</i>

647
00:59:21.583 --> 00:59:25.714
I ran away far, far away from him.

648
00:59:30.364 --> 00:59:31.779
Run away.

649
00:59:38.665 --> 00:59:40.755
Move, Sumimasen.

650
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:52.004
It's not like...
love is that special anyway.

651
00:59:55.931 --> 01:00:00.170
There's no reason to jadedly
hold on to each other like this.

652
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:02.576
I said I'm sorry. Don't be mad.

653
01:00:02.576 --> 01:00:04.567
I'm not mad.

654
01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:06.705
It's weird, but I'm not mad at all.

655
01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:13.598
I... don't want to be scared anymore.

656
01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.391
Let's end it here.

657
01:00:22.672 --> 01:00:25.163
I won't call you disloyal, so leave.

658
01:00:26.025 --> 01:00:27.538
I'll leave too.

659
01:00:45.181 --> 01:00:46.533
I'm sorry.

660
01:00:47.324 --> 01:00:49.232
I'm late, aren't I?

661
01:01:26.909 --> 01:01:29.056
<i>Love was the easiest.</i>

662
01:01:31.786 --> 01:01:34.254
<i>Except when she cried.</i>

663
01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:39.650
<i>Except when she was angry.</i>

664
01:01:41.629 --> 01:01:44.089
<i>Except when she was
having a hard time.</i>

665
01:01:47.556 --> 01:01:50.295
<i>And aside from when
she wouldn't look at me...</i>

666
01:01:51.857 --> 01:01:54.150
<i>love was the easiest.</i>

<i>Yes, Ma Ru. Where are you?</i>

669
01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.701
<i>- Do you see me?
- I told you not to go there!</i>

670
01:02:33.701 --> 01:02:35.348
<i>You could die!</i>

671
01:02:35.348 --> 01:02:38.844
<i>- I'm not dead though.
- You're driving me crazy!</i>

672
01:02:39.868 --> 01:02:41.620
<i>You're dead.</i>

<i>So So, is anything wrong?</i>

674
01:02:43.683 --> 01:02:48.105
<i>How can I be calm? Do you want
to be stuck here? Follow me!</i>

675
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:52.958
<i>We have to stay until the tide goes down.</i>

676
01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:55.417
<i>It'll go down by tomorrow morning.</i>

677
01:02:57.487 --> 01:03:00.822
<i>- Pardon?
- We can leave tomorrow morning.</i>
