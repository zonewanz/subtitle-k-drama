1
00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:09.209
(September, 2017
P Hotel, Yeongjongdo, Incheon)

2
00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.480
(A car arrives secretly.)

3
00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.919
Let's do this, everyone.

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.619
(Awesome people arrive
in suits one by one.)

5
00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.420
(Woo Jin is amazed.)

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.859
(The entire group of Wanna One,
the rookie group of 2017, is here.)

7
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.629
(Why are they here today?)

8
00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.230
I rented this place today, so you
can just go in and have a good time.

9
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.129
(Let us introduce
the citizens here.)

10
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.239
(Kang Daniel,
amazing stamina, always excited)

11
00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:38.369
Don't spit on me.

12
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.240
(Lee Dae Hwi, strong in secret,
the youngest, but most influential)

13
00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.780
I felt it by instinct

14
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.679
(Ha Sung Woon, trusty vocal,
the newest minstrel)

15
00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:46.079
I know everything.

16
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.079
This is...

17
00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.179
What is this?

18
00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.079
(Lai Kuan Lin, the young brain,
I know everything, do I?)

19
00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.590
Let the past go

20
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.590
(Bae Jin Young, used to be dark,
but he's sweet for today)

21
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.159
Why is this person
here like this...

22
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.630
when there are
a lot of other spaces?

23
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.460
(Park Ji Hoon, human magnet,
saved Yoon Ji Sung in my heart)

24
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.000
(Ong Seong Woo, very loud,
full of unique clumsiness)

25
00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.640
(Park Woo Jin, the dolphin, new
discovery of sexy baby oh my lady)

26
00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.439
(Kim Jae Hwan, always cheerful,
innocent face with wild voice)

27
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.310
Why are you being shy?

28
00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.849
You're so cute.

29
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.420
(Hwang Min Hyun, the dad,
you're cuter)

30
00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:26.019
- The square root of 9 is 3.
- How?

31
00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.219
- What?
- Why?

32
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.420
- How does 9 become 3?
- Because it's a square root.

33
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.159
(Yoon Ji Sung, math genius, "because
it's a square root" after 3 seconds)

34
00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.260
- Oh, my.
- It's so fun. It'll be a success.

35
00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.799
Look.

36
00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.200
- Someone's like this.
- What is that?

37
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.569
Isn't that Kim Soo Hyun?

38
00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.269
- We should say "Hello" to him.
- Yes.

39
00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.209
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

40
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.510
- Gosh.
- What is this?

41
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.409
(This man is greeting everyone
greatly with arms wide open.)

42
00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.049
(The game master of Wanna City)

43
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.680
- He's Kim Soo Hyun, right?
- Should we greet him?

44
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.180
Let's say "Hello" to him.

45
00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.790
Let us say "Hello". 1, 2, 3.

46
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.590
- All I wanna do, Wanna One. Hello.
- All I wanna do, Wanna One. Hello.

47
00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.159
(They are very polite.)

48
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.890
He's greeting us with his arms
wide open.

49
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.829
He is very handsome in person.

50
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.099
A unique paradise
for a variety show.

51
00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.300
- Welcome to Wanna City.
- What is this?

52
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.439
Is this voice coming from within?

53
00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.870
- His lips aren't moving.
- I am your guide, Kim Soo Hyun.

54
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.740
I will be together with you today.

55
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.509
(Amazed)

56
00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.680
- Oh, my.
- What is this?

57
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.610
(They are moved by
his introduction.)

58
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.849
- That's amazing.
- Gosh.

59
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.419
(There are tears filled
in his eyes.)

60
00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.580
First, take a card from the front.

61
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.849
- Just pick one randomly.
- They are gold.

62
00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.219
Come on.

63
00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.289
You will fight to win...

64
00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.860
divided by Team Black and Team Red.

65
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.159
Don't forget that the winning team
will win a hefty prize.

66
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.030
- Sure.
- I got it.

67
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.830
- Mine's black.
- Mine too.

68
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.000
Mine's red.

69
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
- Is this it?
- Are these the teams?

70
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Are all your cards black?

71
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.069
We're all underage...

72
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.469
- meanwhile you all are not.
- You're not.

73
00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:54.469
(We were just
as surprised as you are.)

74
00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:58.409
(Team Black, Team Red)

75
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.009
(The teams are now divided.)

76
00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:02.250
Team Black can sit there
while Team Red sits here.

77
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.580
- Right.
- Can we drink this?

78
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.219
Team Red, this way.

79
00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.050
- Okay.
- 1, 2, 3, 4...

80
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.259
(He checks his face.)

81
00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:14.090
All right. Thank you all for coming.

82
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.830
Okay, I wonder what's next.

83
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.430
(Beverages are handed out
to quench their thirst.)

84
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.069
(Amazed)

85
00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.770
Keep it turning.
Isn't it lemonade?

86
00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.870
(He's suspicious.)

87
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.879
Is it good?

88
00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.409
(Everyone enjoys
their welcome drink.)

89
00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.750
I think there's
something in the drink.

90
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.120
- What is it?
- I don't know.

91
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.219
What's wrong?

92
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.189
What is it?

93
00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.330
Team Black is up 1 to 0.

94
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.360
- What?
- Sorry?

95
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.460
The first game is over.

96
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.500
- What?
- What?

97
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.900
What's going on?

98
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.199
(Ecstatic)

99
00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.599
(Devastated)

100
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.009
- Hold on.
- What's wrong with him?

101
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.039
- There's something in his drink.
- Are you serious?

102
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.180
(Hello!)

103
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.750
(One of the drinks was salt water.
The team who drank it loses.)

104
00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.520
(Team Black's spirits are high.)

105
00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.689
(He tasted real salt.)

106
00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:13.689
What's in it?

107
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.849
Let's see.

108
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.020
What is it?

109
00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.590
It was disgusting.

110
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.060
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

111
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.699
(The taste is shocking, horrifying,
unbelievable, and uncanny.)

112
00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:27.970
Is the game really over?

113
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.800
(He makes sure Daniel gets a sip.)

114
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.439
What is this?

115
00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.180
That was fun.

116
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.810
This show is going to rock!

117
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.149
One drink must've been different
from the others,

118
00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:42.279
and Seong Woo chose it.

119
00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.949
I'm sitting dead in the center,

120
00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.089
and I chose first.

121
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.490
You're meant to lose
first games anyway.

122
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.620
Shall we move on?

123
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.689
- Sure.
- Yes.

124
00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:53.189
("Number Game" is worth 2 points.)

125
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:57.459
(The team wins if the number called
out matches the fingers raised.)

126
00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:00.399
You better not cheat.

127
00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:02.269
- Are we done when one team wins?
- Yes.

128
00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:04.069
- It's a sudden death.
- Right.

129
00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.939
Let's play in 1, 2...

130
00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.540
In 1, 2, 3. 11!

131
00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.639
(7 fingers were raised in total.)

132
00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:11.810
Gosh.

133
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.110
In 1, 2, 3. 10.

134
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.750
(8 fingers were raised in total.)

135
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.779
- I guessed wrong.
- Right.

136
00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:19.720
In 1, 2, 3. 12.

137
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.189
No way.

138
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.290
(Jae Hwan is astonished.)

139
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.230
(Numerous sets of eyes
scan the fingers.)

140
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.800
(8 fingers were raised in total.)

141
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.500
You made a fuss
when it was absolutely nothing.

142
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.930
In 1, 2, 3. 11.

143
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.339
- That was close.
- It's 10.

144
00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.839
- Count again.
- 10 fingers.

145
00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:43.009
- That was really close.
- It's our turn.

146
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.209
I have a good feeling about this.
In 1, 2, 3. 13.

147
00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:47.649
(Did he call out the right number?)

148
00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:50.079
In 1, 2, 3. 13. Okay.

149
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.889
- 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12.
- That was so close.

150
00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:57.990
(12 fingers were raised in total.)

151
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.759
You should've said one less,
you idiot!

152
00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.430
If you had, we would've won.

153
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.230
He would've if he had known.

154
00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:06.199
Let's just move on.

155
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.100
- Whose turn is it?
- In 1, 2, 3. 7.

156
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.899
1, 2, 3, 4...

157
00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:11.540
In 1, 2, 3. 7.

158
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.410
1, 2, 3, 4...

159
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.910
(It's a match!)

160
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.579
He did it.

161
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.120
(Giddy)

162
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.319
(No way...)

163
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.220
Why aren't you cheering?

164
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.730
Hold on a second.

165
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.959
I'm on your team,
but I still find it astonishing.

166
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.860
- What is this?
- That was amazing.

167
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.769
We can't seem to beat them.

168
00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:42.399
- Team Black leads 3 to 0.
- Yes, 3 to 0.

169
00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:43.399
(The current score)

170
00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:46.410
- We can't beat them.
- The last game is for four points.

171
00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.480
(No way...)

172
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.750
You can't.

173
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.810
Hold on a second.

174
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.120
The previous games
were all for nothing.

175
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.449
(You've got to be kidding us!)

176
00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.889
- It was all for nothing.
- What's going on?

177
00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:02.519
The games so far
meant nothing at all.

178
00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:03.920
There was no point in winning.

179
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.790
- Exactly.
- We played for no reason.

180
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.689
That's it. That's right.

181
00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:09.060
- Good.
- We won for no reason.

182
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.730
- I know.
- Tell me about it.

183
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.500
(They feel wronged.)

184
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.269
- Kids, this is life.
- We only need to win once.

185
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.139
- It's all in one game.
- Fine, let's do this.

186
00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:19.870
This is fun, so let's do this.

187
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.980
This game is called
"Hello, Cleopatra".

188
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.839
- Yes.
- Nice.

189
00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:27.079
This game is called
"Hello, Cleopatra".

190
00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.250
(This is what we're talking about!)

191
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.720
(This is unfair!)

192
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.550
Hello, Cleopatra

193
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.990
Hello!

194
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.160
("Hello, Cleopatra" is
worth 4 points.)

195
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:41.290
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- Hello!

196
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.560
Hold on a second.

197
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.000
They have too many vocalists.

198
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.769
- Hello!
- Hello!

199
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.000
(Nervous and anxious)

200
00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:51.639
(The game still begins.)

201
00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:53.939
- In 5, 6, 7, 8.
- In 5, 6, 7, 8.

202
00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:59.009
Hello, Cleopatra,
the world's thinnest potato chip

203
00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:04.850
(Daniel raises the key higher.)

204
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:10.620
Hello, Cleopatra,
the world's thinnest potato chip

205
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.160
(This is easy.)

206
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.730
Hello, Cleopatra

207
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.800
The world's thinnest potato chip

208
00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:22.699
(He uses his head voice.)

209
00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:28.009
The world's thinnest potato chip

210
00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:30.879
Hello, Cleopatra

211
00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:32.910
(This is the highest key
he's ever sang in.)

212
00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:36.279
(How's that?)

213
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.149
(Gosh...)

214
00:08:45.129 --> 00:08:47.860
Hello, Cleopatra

215
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.330
(A dolphin appears!)

216
00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:53.269
(So do seals.)

217
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:56.139
The world's thinnest potato chip

218
00:08:56.139 --> 00:08:58.669
(The world's thinnest potato chip)

219
00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:01.110
(The lead vocalist is
feeling the pressure.)

220
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.110
(I'm doomed.)

221
00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:08.480
(His pitch was higher than
that of the lead vocalist.)

222
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.519
I can't believe it. You did it.

223
00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:11.580
We won again.

224
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.889
- Hold on a second.
- Unbelievable.

225
00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:16.289
I can't believe it.

226
00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:17.289
(Team Black wins 7 to 0.)

227
00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:19.429
It didn't even come close.

228
00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:21.129
Woo Jin carried the team.

229
00:09:21.129 --> 00:09:22.559
Something's here.

230
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.629
(They sing a tune
as the prize enters.)

231
00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:25.929
- Congratulations
- Congratulations

232
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.669
- Let's open it on three.
- Jin Young, go ahead.

233
00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:30.200
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

234
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.309
(The winning team receives
a sweet beverage each.)

235
00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:34.870
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

236
00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:37.379
(This is what the losing team gets.)

237
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.509
- Nice!
- It's fine.

238
00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:41.850
Are you kidding me?

239
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.250
How did they even do this?

240
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.720
Let's all dive in and share.

241
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.620
- Here.
- Cheers.

242
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.720
- Wait.
- We should be grateful.

243
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.690
- I actually like that.
- Then...

244
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.529
(I badly want to drink it all.)

245
00:09:57.299 --> 00:10:00.299
(Jealous)

246
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.039
It's delicious.

247
00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:04.669
What do you think you're doing?

248
00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:06.669
- Wait.
- You can't drink it all.

249
00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:08.909
(I'll win the next round.)

250
00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:10.440
(Wanna City)

251
00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:13.210
(Amazed)

252
00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:15.220
(They enter where
Round 2 will take place.)

253
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.250
What is this place?

254
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.649
This reminds me of the place
where our ranking was announced.

255
00:10:20.649 --> 00:10:22.419
- The second time.
- Exactly.

256
00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:24.360
- I agree.
- I remember too.

257
00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:25.659
The steps were here.

258
00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:27.289
I'm always reminded of that...

259
00:10:27.289 --> 00:10:29.899
in places like this
which makes me uncomfortable.

260
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.539
(They must stop when the music does
and answer a question correctly.)

261
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.470
- Stop right there
- Stop right there

262
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.710
(Freeze)

263
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.139
What if the song stops while
we're in the middle of a this move?

264
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.610
(The song they'll dance to is
"Energetic".)

265
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.179
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

266
00:10:48.179 --> 00:10:50.250
(Their rallying cry gets
them ready.)

267
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.620
(The song begins.)

268
00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:55.860
(Nervous)

269
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.820
(He still manages to look handsome.)

270
00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:02.559
(He's nervous.)

271
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.960
(He's nervous too.)

272
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.330
(Gulping)

273
00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:07.029
Please don't stop now.

274
00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:11.299
This is the hardest part.

275
00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:13.409
The music can't stop right now.

276
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.080
Okay.

277
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.120
(They're off to a good start.)

278
00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:25.190
(Daniel's first.)

279
00:11:25.549 --> 00:11:27.220
"Who is most perceptive?"

280
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.220
Ji Sung.

281
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.090
He knows whenever I pretend
not to have ate ramyeon.

282
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.889
(The music plays again.)

283
00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:33.889
(He still thinks it's hilarious.)

284
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.570
This is a bad spot.

285
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.600
(Who's next?)

286
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.769
I didn't eat ramyeon.

287
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.509
"Who's most pretentious?"

288
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:48.980
Jin Young.

289
00:11:50.539 --> 00:11:52.480
He's just very cool.

290
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.549
(I'll get you later for that one.)

291
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.389
("Energetic")

292
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.490
No way.

293
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.289
"Say something to your dad."
Dad, I love you.

294
00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:13.870
(Who's next?)

295
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.110
(The next question is for him.)

296
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.440
Have you eaten?

297
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.440
(The world's sweetest words.)

298
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.379
(Laughter and love are in the air.)

299
00:12:26.549 --> 00:12:31.220
("Energetic")

300
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.259
"When did Wanna One debut?"
August 7!

301
00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:36.490
That's amazing.

302
00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:42.059
(They are busy dancing
and solving the questions.)

303
00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:44.330
(But they still look amazing.)

304
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.840
("Energetic")

305
00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:57.879
(What's next?)

306
00:12:59.809 --> 00:13:01.309
- Who is it?
- It's Jin Young.

307
00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:03.179
"What did you eat
for dinner yesterday?"

308
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.950
Fried chicken.

309
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.190
- Right.
- He's right.

310
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.759
- We shot a commercial.
- He's smart.

311
00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:11.019
(Music, cue.)

312
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.629
(They move to the rhythm...)

313
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:15.600
(get excited,)

314
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.399
(and dance.)

315
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.500
(He shows a technique.)

316
00:13:27.169 --> 00:13:29.009
"Who's the member Daniel
likes the most?"

317
00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:33.980
(My favorite member?)

318
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.679
(I want to be chosen.)

319
00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:38.950
(It's making me nervous
for no reason.)

320
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.419
Ha Sung Woon.

321
00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:46.929
Their faces are the same tone.

322
00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:49.330
That's right.

323
00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:53.100
(Those who haven't been
asked a question are...)

324
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.840
(Woo Jin, Ji Hoon, Sung Woon,
and Min Hyun.)

325
00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:04.210
("Energetic")

326
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.850
"What's 25 plus 78?"

327
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.649
- Wait. That's hard.
- My gosh.

328
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.990
That's...

329
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.720
(I didn't hear anything.)

330
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.159
100... 103.

331
00:14:18.289 --> 00:14:19.330
(He's right!)

332
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:21.830
(The music resumes playing.)

333
00:14:24.854 --> 00:14:28.086
<font color="#80ffff">[Kocowa Ver] E01 Wanna City</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

334
00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:33.809
"Is there anyone you want to
invite to Pink Sausage Team?"

335
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.580
(Another member?)

336
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.639
(Can I join you?)

337
00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:37.639
(I want to join
the Pink Sausage Team.)

338
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:39.879
None.

339
00:14:40.049 --> 00:14:41.179
(He smiles.)

340
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:51.690
("Energetic")

341
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.990
"Which phrase became popular
after 'Koo Koo Ka Ka'?"

342
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.960
"I'll save you in my heart".

343
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.570
(He's a catch phrase maker.)

344
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.070
Something new.

345
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.399
- Something new?
- The frontal lobe.

346
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.700
I will input you
in my frontal lobe.

347
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.909
That's it.

348
00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:11.580
It's hot.

349
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.279
(Groaning)

350
00:15:18.549 --> 00:15:19.549
Oh, dear.

351
00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:20.820
"What do you want to
say to your grandmother?"

352
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.919
"Stay healthy."

353
00:15:22.159 --> 00:15:23.720
(Laughing)

354
00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:26.830
(Their movements become lighter
when the questions are finished.)

355
00:15:34.929 --> 00:15:37.100
(They get their smiles back.)

356
00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.080
(Energetic baby)

357
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.990
(They are amazing.
"Energetic" is lovely.)

358
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.889
It's hot.

359
00:15:55.889 --> 00:15:59.190
(They pass the 1st game of Round 2,
"Stop Right There".)

360
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.730
- This is difficult.
- I am sweating.

361
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.159
It's even tougher
when you try not to sweat.

362
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.730
- You're all warmed up, aren't you?
- Yes.

363
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.730
Let's begin the main game.

364
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.830
What?

365
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.970
Was that just a warm-up?

366
00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:11.269
(The main game of Round 2 begins.)

367
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:12.840
(Wanna City)

368
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.240
This game will...

369
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.309
- test your team work.
- Team work.

370
00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:18.610
- It's a game for us.
- Will we play together?

371
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.809
You will do an arm wrestling.

372
00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:23.649
- Woo Jin is strong. Really strong.
- Jin Young too.

373
00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.250
(But isn't Team Black
at a disadvantage?)

374
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.350
What do we do?

375
00:16:26.789 --> 00:16:28.389
It's a couple arm wrestling.
Two players will be a team.

376
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:29.659
- 2 on 2?
- 2 on 2?

377
00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:31.019
- Lee Dae Hwi?
- Lee Dae Hwi?

378
00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:32.330
- Lee Dae Hwi?
- Me?

379
00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:34.690
(It's 2-on-2 Arm Wrestling.)

380
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.429
(Each team holds a meeting.)

381
00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:38.669
You two should do it. Great.

382
00:16:38.669 --> 00:16:40.299
We already have a plan.

383
00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:41.700
You guys are done for.

384
00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:43.139
(They ignore him.)

385
00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:45.210
(Come on.)

386
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.909
5, 6, 7, 8.

387
00:16:46.909 --> 00:16:48.909
Pink Sausage Team. Cross.

388
00:16:48.909 --> 00:16:50.610
(They are surprised.)

389
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.080
- Are you the first players?
- Yes.

390
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.679
We are the first players.

391
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.580
Okay. Change the order.

392
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.289
- Wait.
- That's not possible.

393
00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:00.450
Dae Hwi, Kuan Lin.

394
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.590
(Beat them.)

395
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.289
- Dae Hwi, Kuan Lin.
- Can't we change the order?

396
00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:04.519
It's all right.
They're our sacrifices.

397
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.399
- Sacrifices.
- They're our sacrifices.

398
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.099
(Jae Hwan and Ji Sung versus
Ji Woon and Woo Jin)

399
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:18.170
- All right.
- We're having a war of nerves.

400
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.440
Wait. Can I stretch my shoulder?

401
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.079
- I will stretch my shoulder.
- You can't get hurt.

402
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.640
- I can't get hurt.
- There's wind.

403
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.809
- Our body is precious.
- Safety first.

404
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.650
- All right.
- I will wait for you.

405
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.880
Goodness, they're
having the war of nerves.

406
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.119
All right. Relax.

407
00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.390
(It's me, Woo Jin.)

408
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:34.650
- Relax.
- Ready.

409
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.759
What's wrong with you?
We're in the same team.

410
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.730
- We are Wanna One.
- We love you all.

411
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:40.990
One. Ready.

412
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.859
Here we go.

413
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.029
1, 2...

414
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.400
- 1, 2, 3.
- Show them what you got.

415
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.670
Come on.

416
00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.769
(The spectators are excited.)

417
00:17:53.609 --> 00:17:55.980
(It's really fun to watch.)

418
00:18:01.609 --> 00:18:05.490
(Ji Hoon and Woo Jin
of Team Black win the 1st game.)

419
00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:10.690
- Our sacrifices are sacrificed.
- They are good.

420
00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.660
Come on. Who's next?

421
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.690
You are the best.

422
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.859
(It's been a tough day
for Woo Jin the Strong Man.)

423
00:18:15.859 --> 00:18:17.829
He's going to do well. Look.

424
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.970
(Team Black wins
without breaking a sweat.)

425
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.069
(Kuan Lin and Dae Hwi will
fight for Team Black on Round 2.)

426
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.740
By the way...

427
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.470
This is going to be boring.

428
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.039
What do you mean?
We are strong.

429
00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:29.680
Don't you know how strong
Dae Hwi is?

430
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.309
We've been acting weak until now.

431
00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:34.009
(Seong Woo and Min Hyun
versus Dae Hwi and Kuan Lin)

432
00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:36.880
(The two teams cheer
for their players.)

433
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.650
(They cheer
in an old-fashioned way.)

434
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.059
Go, Min Hyun! Go, Seong Woo!

435
00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:44.990
We will cheer for our players.
1, 2, 3.

436
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.730
Go, Dae Hwi and Kuan Lin!

437
00:18:47.329 --> 00:18:48.430
(We won't lose, will we?)

438
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.700
- I am strong though.
- That was cute.

439
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.369
- Yes. You are strong.
- That was cute.

440
00:18:53.369 --> 00:18:54.829
Look how different our wrists are.

441
00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:56.970
Look at these poor wrists.

442
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.640
Does anyone need a toothpick?

443
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.269
Dae Hwi, grab Seong Woo's elbow.

444
00:19:00.269 --> 00:19:02.240
Should I hold it?

445
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.309
Ready.

446
00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:06.009
- It's a big match.
- It's a big match.

447
00:19:06.009 --> 00:19:07.809
1, 2, 3. Come on.

448
00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:10.519
1, 2, 3.

449
00:19:11.079 --> 00:19:12.549
(They got defeated
in just a second.)

450
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:15.819
Your wrist isn't broken, is it?

451
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.859
- I heard a snap.
- There was a snap.

452
00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.660
- There was a snap.
- This is cracked.

453
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.829
Is it okay?

454
00:19:20.829 --> 00:19:23.329
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

455
00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:24.660
Please come on out.

456
00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:25.970
We are out.

457
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.700
(Why is he out again?)

458
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.339
- Why did you come out again?
- You're allowed to play twice.

459
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.210
(Sung Woon and Daniel
versus Woo Jin and Jin Young)

460
00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:34.809
- Gosh.
- It's going to break his arm.

461
00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:36.779
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy.

462
00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:37.880
- All right.
- Ready.

463
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.049
I will put power
once the game starts.

464
00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:42.019
My arm can't touch the table.

465
00:19:42.019 --> 00:19:44.220
- Ready.
- Go, Sung Woon! Go, Daniel!

466
00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:46.089
1, 2, 3.

467
00:19:46.089 --> 00:19:47.589
Let's go. Let's go. Let's win.

468
00:19:47.589 --> 00:19:48.920
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

469
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.490
(They're extremely concentrated.)

470
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.529
(Power up!)

471
00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:55.029
Go, Team Red!

472
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:56.130
(Go, team!)

473
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.529
- Come on, Sung Woon.
- Come on.

474
00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:01.029
(The game is not ending.)

475
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.440
(What will happen to
this nip and tuck match?)

476
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.480
(Woo Jin and Jin Young win.)

477
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.150
This is crazy.

478
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.619
(That was tough.)

479
00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:17.950
- I don't have any strength left.
- You were strong.

480
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.619
- I don't have any power left.
- Good job.

481
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.559
- It ended before I even tried.
- Good job.

482
00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.359
(Team Black wins
with the score of 2 to 1.)

483
00:20:24.359 --> 00:20:25.789
(Round 2 is finished.)

484
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:27.960
- Unexpectedly...
- Ours might be better.

485
00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:29.460
We did really well.

486
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.900
The saying goes losing is winning.

487
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.130
- What is it?
- What is it?

488
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.329
- It's jumping.
- What is it?

489
00:20:33.329 --> 00:20:34.900
- It smells like French fries.
- Really?

490
00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.400
- Should we open it?
- All right. Let's open it.

491
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.170
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

492
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.809
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

493
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.779
(What is it?)

494
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.240
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

495
00:20:47.349 --> 00:20:50.250
(The winners get fried chicken.)

496
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.650
(The losers get fried chicken
flavored snacks.)

497
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.720
(Scream!)

498
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.220
- Wait.
- There's a drumstick.

499
00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:57.589
(They can't believe
what they are seeing.)

500
00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.289
- Wait.
- No way.

501
00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.559
- This is beyond my imagination.
- I love this.

502
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.099
- I really love this.
- There's a drumstick.

503
00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:06.430
- I...
- Should we eat it?

504
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.769
- No.
- Wait.

505
00:21:07.769 --> 00:21:08.869
They should've served
enough for all of us.

506
00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:10.869
- I don't eat drumsticks anyway.
- Right.

507
00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:12.339
- You should eat.
- You eat first.

508
00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:15.809
Guys, let's make a toast.

509
00:21:15.809 --> 00:21:18.549
(They make a toast
using chicken-flavored snack.)

510
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.309
It's...

511
00:21:20.309 --> 00:21:22.119
- We can't finish it anyway.
- We are only five.

512
00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:23.519
- We can't finish it.
- We can't finish it.

513
00:21:23.519 --> 00:21:26.119
- Just eat it.
- That's not it.

514
00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.150
Who wants it?

515
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:29.690
- Me.
- Wait.

516
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:30.890
You have to act cute first.

517
00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:33.559
(Act cute?)

518
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:34.890
You have to act cute first.

519
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.230
(Is he asking us to act cute
for a piece of fried chicken?)

520
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.269
(My gosh!)

521
00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:43.400
(No problem.)

522
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.369
I want chicken.

523
00:21:45.369 --> 00:21:48.009
(It becomes a mess.)

524
00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.609
The camera is over there.

525
00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:53.450
(They are doing
all kinds of things.)

526
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.220
Okay. That's enough.

527
00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.279
Do everything you want.

528
00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.289
Thanks.

529
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.220
You have to act cute.

530
00:22:01.589 --> 00:22:03.190
Act cute. What are you doing?

531
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.029
- Do you not want to do it?
- I won't beg for it.

532
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:06.630
- I won't eat it.
- Won't you eat it?

533
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.500
Let's enjoy it.

534
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.130
I am upset.

535
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.700
(Here you go.)

536
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.670
I don't want French fries.
I want chicken.

537
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:21.809
(Wanna City)

538
00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:24.609
I am going to win this time.

539
00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:26.809
Watch out, Team Black.

540
00:22:26.809 --> 00:22:28.380
- We are going to win this time.
- Go, team!

541
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.049
(Two rooms...)

542
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.789
(await for Wanna One.)

543
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:36.690
(What will happen here?)

544
00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:39.759
(Team Red enters the venue
for Round 3.)

545
00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:42.859
What's going on?

546
00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:44.529
What's this?

547
00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:46.099
- What's this? I'm scared.
- My gosh.

548
00:22:46.099 --> 00:22:47.730
I think we sit here.

549
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.140
I guess we are supposed
to be sitting here, right?

550
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.140
What's the laptop for?

551
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.670
(What will be
the mission this time?)

552
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.869
- What's the laptop for?
- All right.

553
00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.009
(He starts a sketch.)

554
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.579
The item I brought this time is...

555
00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.150
- Send it to New York.
- Send it along with cheesecake.

556
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.049
- Cheesecake to New York?
- Okay.

557
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:04.319
Hello?

558
00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:06.390
Please send the cheesecake
to New York.

559
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:07.390
Will do, sir.

560
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.390
(Team Red is having fun.
What is Team Black up to?)

561
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.819
(Team Black enters
the empty room.)

562
00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:12.890
You lose!

563
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.460
(They're humming the background
music for "Love House".)

564
00:23:15.829 --> 00:23:19.130
I love this. Isn't it like this?

565
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.000
You sit here.

566
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.140
Calm down.

567
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.200
Let's start the mission.

568
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.910
- Jin Young.
- Keep your class.

569
00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.240
Have a seat.

570
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.309
Let's go.

571
00:23:28.309 --> 00:23:29.809
Have a seat. Calm down.

572
00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:31.750
It looks like a place
for a strategy meeting.

573
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.710
You've seen too many movies.

574
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.119
Look at that.

575
00:23:35.119 --> 00:23:36.380
(What did Ji Hoon see?)

576
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.319
(The doors are locked.)

577
00:23:38.319 --> 00:23:41.119
It doesn't feel good.

578
00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:42.119
What's going on?

579
00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.460
(What?)

580
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.359
I think we have to open this.

581
00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:48.359
It's like room escape.

582
00:23:48.359 --> 00:23:49.559
(Room escape?)

583
00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:50.559
(Bingo.)

584
00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:52.369
Gosh, that surprised me.

585
00:23:52.369 --> 00:23:53.900
That really surprised me.

586
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.069
What's going on?

587
00:23:55.069 --> 00:23:56.400
(The screen suddenly turned on.)

588
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.309
- Keep it down, boys.
- This is going to be fun.

589
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.609
"You are at the editing room
of Wanna-patch,"

590
00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:05.210
"Korea's top-selling
entertainment newspaper company."

591
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.309
I will be the General Manager.

592
00:24:07.049 --> 00:24:10.279
"This is Wanna Entertainment
which produced many celebrities."

593
00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:11.890
(You are at the overseas
business department...)

594
00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.750
(which is in charge
of the overseas expansion.)

595
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.390
You're given 30 minutes.

596
00:24:16.859 --> 00:24:18.930
- What's going on?
- "You must escape this place."

597
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.130
Let's do this.

598
00:24:21.329 --> 00:24:23.700
- Look at that.
- It began.

599
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.700
Look.

600
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.329
(It's chaotic.)

601
00:24:26.329 --> 00:24:27.599
I used to work
at a room escape place.

602
00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:29.900
- Trust me.
- What do we have to do?

603
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.609
(I don't know. Just crawl.)

604
00:24:32.809 --> 00:24:34.740
- Don't move. The suspect...
- No.

605
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.509
The suspect is in here.

606
00:24:36.509 --> 00:24:37.839
- The suspect is here.
- The suspect is here.

607
00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:39.049
What is this?

608
00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:41.079
- What's this?
- Let's escape...

609
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.450
(Please open the door.)

610
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.819
Come on.

611
00:24:44.849 --> 00:24:47.589
One is a number lock.
One is a key lock.

612
00:24:47.589 --> 00:24:48.589
What's the other one?

613
00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:55.529
(There are 3 locks on the door.
The team that escapes 1st wins.)

614
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.059
I used to work at a room
escape place. I got this.

615
00:24:58.059 --> 00:24:59.099
We need to solve this.

616
00:25:00.569 --> 00:25:02.170
Here's a job request
for Wanna-patch.

617
00:25:02.339 --> 00:25:04.670
(Did they find the hint right away?)

618
00:25:04.869 --> 00:25:06.339
It's addressed to Wanna One.

619
00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:10.109
"A job request. I wish you
the best luck, Wanna One."

620
00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:12.710
"Please get the job done
according to the description below."

621
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.880
"Cover the interview of NU'EST
presented by Eric Nam."

622
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.950
Why Eric?

623
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.390
Are you doing well, Eric?

624
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.059
- "Eat lunch and..."
- Wait.

625
00:25:22.589 --> 00:25:24.619
- We...
- On 27th?

626
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:26.789
When is the 27th?

627
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:27.789
(The interview is held on
September 27, Wednesday at 1pm.)

628
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:29.160
(What are we supposed to cover?)

629
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.970
I think... This means "west".

630
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.299
There are "west" and "north".

631
00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:34.299
There's "south".

632
00:25:35.099 --> 00:25:36.470
It's "east, west, south, and north".

633
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.339
You're right.
It's "east, west, south, and north".

634
00:25:38.509 --> 00:25:40.309
But there's no "east".

635
00:25:40.309 --> 00:25:41.309
(There are
"west, north, and south".)

636
00:25:41.309 --> 00:25:43.339
(This is my limit.)

637
00:25:43.339 --> 00:25:45.380
(They keep thinking.)

638
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.950
(Min Hyun gets an idea.)

639
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.880
- NU'EST. That's "east".
- That's "east".

640
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.980
(NU'EST means "east".)

641
00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.250
- "West, north, south, and east".
- NU'EST means "east".

642
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.549
It's "west, north, south, and east".

643
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:56.259
I got it.

644
00:25:56.259 --> 00:25:58.789
- Look. This is west, right?
- "West, north, south, and east".

645
00:25:59.029 --> 00:26:00.029
West.

646
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:01.799
- Where is north?
- North is up.

647
00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:04.160
- And then?
- North.

648
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:05.630
To the right.

649
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.430
(Please open.)

650
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.000
(Their reasoning ability
is surprising.)

651
00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:13.569
(Will Team Red be able to
open the first lock?)

652
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.009
We have it here.

653
00:26:16.579 --> 00:26:18.680
There's a hint. There's one.

654
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.210
- Everyone...
- Isn't this it?

655
00:26:21.609 --> 00:26:23.549
(He finds a strange note.)

656
00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:26.519
(There was a note on the laptop
with strange numbers.)

657
00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:28.619
(Will these numbers open the lock?)

658
00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:29.890
Isn't this the combination?

659
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.619
- What is that?
- Isn't this the combination?

660
00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:32.730
Do we have four numbers?

661
00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:34.890
(They give it a try right away.)

662
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200
No.

663
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.299
(But the lock is not opened
with the numbers in the note.)

664
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:41.900
This is not it.

665
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.000
(He concentrates.)

666
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
(What? What's this?)

667
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.069
Bring that. Where is the note?

668
00:26:47.609 --> 00:26:49.180
This is so fun.

669
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.509
The first is 0820.

670
00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:53.180
This is our schedule.

671
00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.680
(It's Wanna One's abroad schedule.)

672
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.150
The 1st is 0820.

673
00:26:57.579 --> 00:26:58.589
0923.

674
00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:02.119
KCON Australia.

675
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.019
Wasn't there a map?

676
00:27:04.019 --> 00:27:05.029
0924.

677
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:07.160
(What do the schedule
and these numbers mean?)

678
00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.259
I remembered them all.

679
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.470
I remembered them all.
Let's hurry up and do it.

680
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:16.470
So how do you
use this information now?

681
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.470
Wait.

682
00:27:19.109 --> 00:27:23.339
Hurry up. Look for America.

683
00:27:23.509 --> 00:27:26.250
This is Europe. Wait.

684
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.480
Don't look at South America.
Search for North America.

685
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.920
- What will you do with it?
- What will you do?

686
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.289
It's right here.

687
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.019
Right. What do you do with it?

688
00:27:35.019 --> 00:27:36.019
(They found it.
But what will they use it for?)

689
00:27:36.019 --> 00:27:38.359
- Now...
- What will you do with it?

690
00:27:38.359 --> 00:27:40.230
(Why is there a camera?)

691
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.329
Let me see that.

692
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.369
(There's something.)

693
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.869
(Did I find something?)

694
00:27:46.869 --> 00:27:48.569
Here you go.

695
00:27:49.869 --> 00:27:51.940
(What is this?)

696
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.109
- What's that?
- What's that?

697
00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:57.039
Great.

698
00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:02.279
(Oh, my gosh)

699
00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:06.089
(What is this alien language?)

700
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.259
What's this? Boracay?

701
00:28:09.259 --> 00:28:10.819
(The symbols frustrate Team Black.)

702
00:28:10.819 --> 00:28:12.490
What is this?

703
00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.029
- I feel insulted.
- I feel insulted.

704
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:17.400
- This is too difficult.
- Square root of four?

705
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.829
(Square root of four?)

706
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.599
I gave up math a long time ago.

707
00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:23.140
I gave it up
when I was in eighth grade.

708
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.670
(Will they be able to get out
of the room within the day?)

709
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:26.670
(Team Red)

710
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.039
I opened it.

711
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:29.779
I opened it.

712
00:28:29.779 --> 00:28:30.940
- Nice job.
- I knew he would do it.

713
00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.910
I used to work
at a room escape cafe.

714
00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.119
(Now 2 locks remain.)

715
00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.779
Here's the next one.

716
00:28:36.779 --> 00:28:39.490
On Wednesday at noon,
we have lunch in Gangnam...

717
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:41.390
- and move to...
- That's useless.

718
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:42.619
I think that's useless.

719
00:28:42.619 --> 00:28:45.289
We have already solved
the puzzle with that information.

720
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:47.490
- So that's useless now.
- Is that right?

721
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.599
Of course.

722
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:50.029
Lovely.

723
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:51.400
This is frustrating.

724
00:28:54.829 --> 00:28:56.670
I have to use my strength
to solve this.

725
00:28:58.509 --> 00:29:00.509
I feel like something
should be here.

726
00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:04.539
Since there's a camera here,
there's something in here.

727
00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:07.049
What could
these four numbers mean?

728
00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.220
- Four numbers?
- What do they mean?

729
00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.549
What do the four numbers mean?

730
00:29:13.049 --> 00:29:15.359
(Seong Woo has been
looking at the corner.)

731
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.059
When I opened this,
this came out.

732
00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.059
(Team Red finds
the symbol chart too.)

733
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.200
- Who learned about square root?
- I will do it.

734
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.769
I've never learned about it.

735
00:29:25.769 --> 00:29:29.500
BTOB has seven members.

736
00:29:29.839 --> 00:29:31.670
(BTOB?)

737
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.839
(Are they the initials
for idol groups?)

738
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.940
BTOB has seven members.

739
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.440
- Mamamoo.
- Mamamoo has four members.

740
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.710
- We got it.
- BTS.

741
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:39.980
Boom Boom?

742
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.349
- No.
- Is it Park Bom?

743
00:29:41.349 --> 00:29:42.880
- No.
- It should be a group.

744
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.480
- Big Bang.
- Big Bang.

745
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.549
- Highlight.
- Highlight. Multiply by...

746
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:48.490
- Now...
- The laptop has a calculator.

747
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:49.660
- The laptop has a calculator.
- It's...

748
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.960
- Where?
- The laptop has a calculator.

749
00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.759
Every laptop has a calculator.

750
00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.700
- Look for a calculator.
- We are genius.

751
00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.160
Goodness.

752
00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.869
They must've been shocked.

753
00:29:58.869 --> 00:30:00.069
- What?
- It's there.

754
00:30:00.069 --> 00:30:02.099
I wrote "calculator" wrong.

755
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.940
Calculator.

756
00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:08.579
They must've never imagined
that we'd figure it out so quickly.

757
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.640
Add 7 to 804.

758
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.109
Add... I mean subtract four.

759
00:30:14.109 --> 00:30:15.480
We're doing well.

760
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.250
Add seven and...

761
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.890
By the way, Sechs Kies...

762
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.190
used to be 6, but they're 5 now.

763
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.660
Subtract it by 5.

764
00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.190
This is amazing.

765
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.690
Multiply it by square root of nine.

766
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.200
(Square root of nine?)

767
00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:34.000
- Isn't this the square root?
- Here it is.

768
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
That's it.

769
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.039
- 7290.
- 7290.

770
00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:38.470
(What does 7290 mean?)

771
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.710
We got it.

772
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:40.910
Okay.

773
00:30:43.109 --> 00:30:45.650
(Will the lock open?)

774
00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:46.910
It won't open.

775
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.579
(Where did it go wrong?)

776
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.920
Why isn't there anyone here?

777
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.220
- All right.
- It's not our forte.

778
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.690
Come here everyone.

779
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.289
On the count of three...

780
00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.220
We are the strongest
ones in the team.

781
00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:59.630
- No way.
- Let's find clues.

782
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.490
(They haven't found any clues.)

783
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.599
What are you doing?

784
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:04.359
Can this be it? No, right?

785
00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:05.430
(Time keeps passing.)

786
00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:11.099
All right.

787
00:31:11.099 --> 00:31:12.269
(Eureka!)

788
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:13.869
I got it.

789
00:31:13.869 --> 00:31:14.869
What is it?

790
00:31:15.339 --> 00:31:18.410
These are the initials
of groups. I.O.I, Seventeen...

791
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.410
- Count the number of members.
- Black Pink.

792
00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.349
- There's Black Pink.
- There's g.o.d.

793
00:31:23.349 --> 00:31:25.420
- Vixx.
- That's Vixx.

794
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:26.990
Girls' Generation.

795
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.220
Square root 4 is 2.

796
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.720
- Is it really 2?
- It is 2.

797
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.890
- I.O.I has 11 members.
- 11 members.

798
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.759
(Solve from the top.)

799
00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:38.130
- It's 1630.
- It's 1630.

800
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.269
It's either 1630 or 1631.

801
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.740
(At first, we thought
it was alien language.)

802
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.440
(But they were
the fellow idol group names.)

803
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:48.740
(We calculated
the square root as well.)

804
00:31:49.839 --> 00:31:52.009
(Please open.)

805
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.210
I opened one.

806
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:54.410
- We got it.
- We did it.

807
00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.750
- Did it open?
- I am a genius.

808
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.150
(They have 17 minutes
and 50 seconds left now.)

809
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.289
(Now 2 locks remain.)

810
00:32:00.349 --> 00:32:02.220
Come here, guys.
Let's solve this first.

811
00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:05.490
- How...
- Solve the square root of nine.

812
00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:07.430
I will calculate.

813
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.529
Square root of 9 is 3.

814
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.529
- How? Why?
- Why?

815
00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:15.640
How can 9 be 3?

816
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.440
- It's square root of 9.
- Okay.

817
00:32:17.599 --> 00:32:18.710
It's 3.

818
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.470
Let's give it a try.
Let's multiply it by 3.

819
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.240
(What is the number?)

820
00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.049
(They are very serious.)

821
00:32:26.049 --> 00:32:27.109
(What number did they get?)

822
00:32:27.109 --> 00:32:28.150
It's 2427.

823
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.349
(Did they finally get the answer?)

824
00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:35.319
- We got it.
- We got it.

825
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:36.589
- We got it.
- We got it.

826
00:32:36.589 --> 00:32:37.589
Okay.

827
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:40.230
- Here.
- Now just bring a saw.

828
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.230
Bring a saw.

829
00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.299
Let's get a saw and open it.

830
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:44.599
(Now only 1 lock remains.)

831
00:32:44.599 --> 00:32:46.799
(10 minutes and 45 seconds remain.)

832
00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:49.140
(Team Black still have
2 locks to open.)

833
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.369
I think I get this.

834
00:32:53.569 --> 00:32:55.240
It departs from Seoul...

835
00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.549
and leaves for Los Angeles.
This is the direction.

836
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.180
We depart from Seoul
and go to Los Angeles.

837
00:33:01.309 --> 00:33:02.880
Where do we go on September 23?

838
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.680
- Australia.
- Australia.

839
00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.150
Then go down.

840
00:33:06.849 --> 00:33:08.319
- Hong Kong.
- Go up.

841
00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:09.789
Go down.

842
00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:15.900
- It worked!
- It worked!

843
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.400
(It worked!)

844
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.599
- Let's go.
- We got it.

845
00:33:19.599 --> 00:33:20.670
Do we have one lock left now?

846
00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:24.299
(Both teams have 1 lock to open.)

847
00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:25.609
(They only have 7 minutes.)

848
00:33:25.609 --> 00:33:27.869
(They have to escape
sooner than the other team.)

849
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.710
(They have to find
the hidden last hint.)

850
00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:35.450
(Please give us a hint.
We have to win this time.)

851
00:33:35.619 --> 00:33:38.349
(Team Black dreams of
winning on Round 3 too.)

852
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:40.819
(Team Red is desperate to win.)

853
00:33:40.819 --> 00:33:42.089
(This is frustrating.)

854
00:33:42.089 --> 00:33:43.559
(I don't see a key.)

855
00:33:45.559 --> 00:33:48.259
(I still can't see it.)

856
00:33:49.359 --> 00:33:51.559
(They have to escape the room
faster than anyone.)

857
00:33:51.559 --> 00:33:54.500
(Which team...)

858
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.200
(will complete the mission
and escape the room?)

859
00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.940
From my years of experience
working in a room escape cafe,

860
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.009
keys are usually...

861
00:34:03.009 --> 00:34:06.250
(What usually happens to the keys?)

862
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:07.980
- hidden.
- Could it be inside of something?

863
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.349
Right. It should be hidden inside
something. Where could it be?

864
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:13.289
I want to solve it on my own.

865
00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:15.119
(Jae Hwan was checking
the bottom of the chair.)

866
00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.960
I found it.

867
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.960
- Bravo.
- Okay.

868
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.760
(Jae Hwan finds the last clue.)

869
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.199
- Where was it?
- He found it.

870
00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:27.099
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- It was underneath the chair.

871
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.099
- Here it is.
- What does it say?

872
00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.710
To be one! Wanna One!

873
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.340
Everyone in the team should go up
on this envelop and last 11 seconds.

874
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.739
Take off your shoes.

875
00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.050
- Take off your shoes.
- I can lift two people.

876
00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.449
Take off your shoes.

877
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:44.050
The ones on our back
should hold us.

878
00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:46.650
How can we stand on one foot?

879
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:50.360
Should we link each other's
arms like this?

880
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.059
- How's this?
- Pull each other.

881
00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:54.590
- You should pull each other.
- Go down.

882
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.699
- Should we pull each other?
- Really?

883
00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:58.099
Shouldn't we pull each other?

884
00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.969
But it doesn't work.

885
00:34:59.969 --> 00:35:01.369
Step on my foot.

886
00:35:01.469 --> 00:35:03.170
- Like this?
- Step on my foot.

887
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.840
- Step on my foot.
- This is a great idea.

888
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.369
And lift your other foot
on the count of three.

889
00:35:07.369 --> 00:35:09.079
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

890
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.980
Wait.

891
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.210
Wait.

892
00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:14.349
- Wait.
- How many seconds is it?

893
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:16.380
- 11 seconds.
- Step on my foot.

894
00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:18.920
- Go in.
- This is too funny.

895
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.320
Pull each other. Pull each other.

896
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.489
1, 2, 3.

897
00:35:22.889 --> 00:35:24.320
This is so funny.

898
00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:29.530
(They fail again.)

899
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.630
Do it again.

900
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.130
Hurry up. Go up.

901
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.170
(Meanwhile, Team Black
is searching the room.)

902
00:35:36.639 --> 00:35:39.070
I have no clue. Wait.

903
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.510
(He threatens the crew
through the window.)

904
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.610
You know, don't you?

905
00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.710
(Team Black has a hard time
finding the last clue.)

906
00:35:45.949 --> 00:35:47.110
Use that.

907
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:48.880
It should be here somewhere.

908
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.090
- 1, 2, 3.
- Lift your foot.

909
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.420
1, 2.

910
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.789
Gosh.

911
00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:56.619
- Wait.
- This is not it.

912
00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.260
- This is not it.
- Wait. How can we stand?

913
00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.829
Some of us should be
on our shoulders.

914
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:03.760
(His tongue gets tied.)

915
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.699
- Wait.
- There is a way.

916
00:36:06.699 --> 00:36:10.070
What if one person
carries one person in the back?

917
00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:14.369
But we can't stand on one foot
for 11 seconds.

918
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.880
(I am the man of wisdom.
Please let me think of a solution.)

919
00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.650
(There must be a way.)

920
00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.719
"Every member of the team
should stand on the envelope."

921
00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:26.590
(Oh?)

922
00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:28.050
Wait.

923
00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.659
What if we open the envelope
and make it wider?

924
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.760
- He's right!
- Rip the envelope!

925
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.500
- Rip it.
- He's right. He's right.

926
00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:40.070
- He's right.
- Let's rip it.

927
00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:43.039
- Let's try it.
- Let's rip it.

928
00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:44.769
- Rip it.
- It's already ripped.

929
00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:46.539
It didn't say that
we shouldn't rip the envelope.

930
00:36:46.539 --> 00:36:48.409
- Right.
- Right.

931
00:36:48.409 --> 00:36:49.739
They should've said
do not rip it.

932
00:36:49.739 --> 00:36:51.340
Rip it so that each of us get one.

933
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.510
- Rip more.
- Stand on one.

934
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.750
Let's rip it in four pieces
and stand on them with one foot.

935
00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.750
- It's already ripped.
- It's done.

936
00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.989
- You can make one more.
- Here.

937
00:37:02.159 --> 00:37:03.590
- Now let's stand on it.
- Okay.

938
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.659
Let's hold hands.

939
00:37:04.659 --> 00:37:06.059
- Step on it.
- 1, 2, 3.

940
00:37:06.329 --> 00:37:07.989
- 1, 2, 3.
- We did it.

941
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:10.300
Step on my foot.

942
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.170
5, 6, 7,

943
00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.300
8, 9,

944
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.039
10, 11.

945
00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.239
(They succeed.)

946
00:37:19.809 --> 00:37:21.110
(They are thrilled.)

947
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.280
(A key is thrown.)

948
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.579
Let's get out.

949
00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:26.849
Get out.

950
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:29.380
- Let's get out.
- Let's hurry out.

951
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.590
Don't get your shoes.

952
00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.119
Just leave your shoes.

953
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.860
- We have to escape before they do.
- We have to go first.

954
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.889
- Hurry out.
- Get out.

955
00:37:41.929 --> 00:37:43.929
(They run outside.)

956
00:37:44.099 --> 00:37:45.929
I'm barefooted.

957
00:37:45.929 --> 00:37:47.530
(Where is the prize?)

958
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.469
What is it?

959
00:37:50.639 --> 00:37:52.369
Use the stairs and go to Room 11000.

960
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.380
(Their final destination
is Room 110000.)

961
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.940
- We did it.
- We did it.

962
00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:59.280
Should we hide?

963
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:00.679
Let's hide.

964
00:38:00.679 --> 00:38:01.980
Let's hide.

965
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:03.280
(They move busily
to fool the other team members.)

966
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.380
Let's go.

967
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.789
What?

968
00:38:05.789 --> 00:38:07.090
- Did they escape first?
- What?

969
00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.420
- What happened?
- No way.

970
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.389
(He pretends he hasn't
seen it yet.)

971
00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:12.429
What is that?

972
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:14.159
(What's this?)

973
00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:15.659
- What's this?
- It's my ring.

974
00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:18.900
We have something to show you.

975
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.500
- Let's go.
- What is it?

976
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.670
(Ta-da!)

977
00:38:24.699 --> 00:38:27.610
(It's the card key which lets them
take the elevator to Room 11000.)

978
00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:30.280
We got one too.

979
00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.710
Show them.

980
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.010
Do you not have this?

981
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.519
(What happened?)

982
00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:37.579
(Here's what happened.)

983
00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:44.219
(5 minutes ago)

984
00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.190
Why is the camera here?

985
00:38:46.659 --> 00:38:48.929
(Dae Hwi wondered why
the camera was hidden in a corner.)

986
00:38:48.929 --> 00:38:50.630
Why is the camera here?

987
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:52.070
It should be where the camera is.

988
00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.429
(Where there's a camera,
there is something.)

989
00:38:53.769 --> 00:38:55.039
(Oh?)

990
00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.500
I think I am quick-witted.

991
00:38:57.699 --> 00:38:59.710
(Team Black finds the last clue.)

992
00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:01.469
I am good at playing games.

993
00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:04.210
He found it.

994
00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.409
"To be one! Wanna One!"

995
00:39:06.409 --> 00:39:10.079
"Every member should stand on
this envelope and last 11 seconds."

996
00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.920
If we were six,

997
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:13.420
- we would've been in trouble.
- I know.

998
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.059
- My legs are weak.
- Do that.

999
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.420
And hug each other.

1000
00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.489
(They give a piggyback
to another member and hug.)

1001
00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.929
Woo Jin, please keep the balance.

1002
00:39:20.929 --> 00:39:22.599
(The counting begins.)

1003
00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:25.170
1, 2, 3,

1004
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.300
- Come on.
- 4, 5,

1005
00:39:27.469 --> 00:39:30.969
6, 7, 8, 9,

1006
00:39:30.969 --> 00:39:32.769
10, 11.

1007
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.469
(They succeed in one try.)

1008
00:39:34.469 --> 00:39:35.739
- Let's go.
- We did it.

1009
00:39:35.739 --> 00:39:36.739
Let's escape.

1010
00:39:36.739 --> 00:39:40.250
(Team Black open the last lock
and escape the room.)

1011
00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:42.820
Did we come out first?

1012
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.650
(Team Red is not out yet.)

1013
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:45.719
We got out first.

1014
00:39:45.949 --> 00:39:47.590
Don't make any noise.

1015
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:48.889
Open.

1016
00:39:49.889 --> 00:39:50.989
It's the key to the penthouse.

1017
00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:52.489
Let's go.

1018
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.789
Where is it?

1019
00:39:54.789 --> 00:39:56.829
(This is what happened.)

1020
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:57.900
Do you have a card like this?

1021
00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.630
Perhaps we have to take the stairs
while they ride the elevator.

1022
00:40:00.769 --> 00:40:02.539
Perhaps we have to take the stairs
while they ride the elevator.

1023
00:40:02.539 --> 00:40:04.500
- Wait.
- We can ride with them.

1024
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.969
I am barefooted.

1025
00:40:05.969 --> 00:40:07.039
I am barefooted as well.

1026
00:40:07.039 --> 00:40:08.809
We came out on barefoot.

1027
00:40:08.809 --> 00:40:09.880
(Team Black wins
a sweeping victory.)

1028
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.440
- Let's go.
- It's a pumpkin carriage.

1029
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.280
I will give you my gold card.

1030
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:16.820
- Go get something good.
- You are amazing.

1031
00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.519
Then let us ride the elevator.

1032
00:40:18.519 --> 00:40:19.690
You can't ride the elevator.

1033
00:40:20.449 --> 00:40:21.489
It's the elevator.

1034
00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.659
This way for the elevator,
and that way for the stairs.

1035
00:40:23.659 --> 00:40:25.289
We will see you up there.

1036
00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.789
- Have fun.
- Good luck.

1037
00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.429
I'm going to run.

1038
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.800
Don't run.

1039
00:40:30.329 --> 00:40:31.630
Are we really running?

1040
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.900
- We are really.
- Really?

1041
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.699
(Are they running to Floor 11?)

1042
00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:36.739
It would be too tough
for the cameramen. Let's walk.

1043
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.010
- It's hard for the cameraman.
- This is really happening.

1044
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.840
- We are really taking the stairs.
- We are really taking the stairs.

1045
00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.909
(Yes, you are really
taking the stairs.)

1046
00:40:42.909 --> 00:40:44.280
We are here.

1047
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.349
(They arrive at the penthouse
fast and swiftly.)

1048
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:46.849
It's here.

1049
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:49.050
Ta-da.

1050
00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.920
(Their eyes open big
and jaws drop.)

1051
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.989
- No way.
- I love you.

1052
00:40:53.019 --> 00:40:54.519
This is crazy.

1053
00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.420
This is amazing.

1054
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.059
(We prepared a special treat
for Wanna One.)

1055
00:40:58.059 --> 00:40:59.829
This is a house.

1056
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.630
What is this place?

1057
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.730
Don't lie down. Don't.

1058
00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.130
Did they say we can't lie down?

1059
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.099
It looks like we shouldn't lie down.

1060
00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:08.869
Goodness.

1061
00:41:08.869 --> 00:41:11.099
I will take a shower now.

1062
00:41:11.199 --> 00:41:12.340
Hot shower?

1063
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.940
(We're more excited to see
Ji Hoon's abs,)

1064
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.480
(but we will check it next time.)

1065
00:41:15.679 --> 00:41:18.409
When we arrive in the room,
we should pretend to be cool.

1066
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.110
Don't look tired.

1067
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.250
Don't look tired.

1068
00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.750
The moment we gasp, we lose.

1069

(After 10 minutes)

1070
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:26.289
Go, team!

1071
00:41:26.289 --> 00:41:27.590
I am so tired.

1072
00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:31.260
Make me brave

1073
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:34.690
Once again

1074
00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:40.429
Make me strong enough
to defeat rough waves

1075
00:41:40.769 --> 00:41:42.070
Catch your breath.

1076
00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:43.269
Pretend you're not tired.

1077
00:41:43.769 --> 00:41:44.940
Don't gasp.

1078
00:41:46.769 --> 00:41:48.510
It's here. I hear them.

1079
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.079
(He doesn't even have
any strength to talk.)

1080
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.110
11th floor is too high.

1081
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.349
(They are amazed by the splendor.)

1082
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:58.420
- What's this?
- They're having a party.

1083
00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.750
It's as if you came here
one hour ago.

(They changed into pajamas.)

1086
00:42:04.659 --> 00:42:06.559
(They look comfortable as if
they became one with the sofa.)

1087
00:42:06.559 --> 00:42:08.900
You look relaxed, don't you?

1088
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.329
Hello, we are Wanna One.

1089

makes them sadder.)

You look very relaxed.

Jin Young, your sleeping acting
is very bad.

1093
00:42:18.239 --> 00:42:19.809
Did you take the stairs?

1094
00:42:19.809 --> 00:42:21.010
Aren't you tired?

1095
00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:23.340
- The pajamas...
- Aren't we tired?

1096
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.909
Do you want to try it?

1097

(Wanna One reunites
after changing into pajamas.)

1098

when they are resting?)

for the fans of Wanna One.)

1101

Give it to you

1102

Cause uptown funk
going to give it to you

Cause uptown funk
going to give it to you

Drop the beat.

00:43:31.579 --> 00:43:32.780
(Type 4, The chatterbox)

1120
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.449
I am waiting for you

1121
00:43:37.219 --> 00:43:40.219
- I am waiting for you
- They're filming us.

1122
00:43:40.219 --> 00:43:42.260
There is a camera filming us.

1123
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.889
- It's embarrassing.
- Why is it embarrassing?

1124
00:43:43.889 --> 00:43:45.789
- We are on a bed.
- Why is it embarrassing?

1125
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.730
- Stop it.
- What?

1126
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:49.130
Why is it embarrassing?

1127
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.500
Are you embarrassed of me?

1128
00:43:51.429 --> 00:43:52.969
- You have a muffin top.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1129
00:43:52.969 --> 00:43:54.599
How cute!

1130
00:43:55.239 --> 00:43:57.469
Don't say that I have a muffin top.

1131
00:43:57.469 --> 00:43:59.239
I don't want people to believe it.

1132
00:43:59.809 --> 00:44:01.010
They won't believe it.

1133
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:03.809
Come on! Ta-da!

1134
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.179
(Woo Jin interrupts their moment.)

1135
00:44:10.179 --> 00:44:13.119
(He didn't leave the bed
for a long time.)

1136
00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:14.190
(The shoot resumes.)

1137
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.789
Does it feel like
something is missing?

1138
00:44:16.789 --> 00:44:19.329
We need something to snack on.

1139
00:44:19.329 --> 00:44:20.530
Every party needs a game, food,

1140
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.400
- and drinks.
- A board game?

1141
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.730
- That's right.
- Drinks?

1142
00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:25.699
I wasn't talking
about alcoholic drinks.

1143
00:44:25.699 --> 00:44:27.800
- We need something like juice.
- Coke?

1144
00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:29.099
(That's why we prepared this.)

1145
00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:30.800
No way!

1146
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.570
- No way!
- This is the best.

1147
00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:33.570
(Standing up)

1148
00:44:34.094 --> 00:44:37.326
<font color="#80ffff">[Kocowa Ver] E01 Wanna City</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

1149
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.280
(The production crew's gift
will make the party shine.)

1150
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:42.519
(Oh, yes.)

1151
00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:44.949
I really want to eat.
I am so excited.

1152
00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.289
(Here come sandwiches and fries.)

1153
00:44:47.849 --> 00:44:49.889
We won't get chogochujang
instead of ketchup, will we?

1154
00:44:49.889 --> 00:44:51.929
- Is that for a game?
- Do we need to play a game?

1155
00:44:52.329 --> 00:44:53.929
- We need to do something to eat.
- We need to do something.

1156
00:44:53.929 --> 00:44:54.960
- My goodness.
- I heard something.

1157
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.659
The fries look delicious.

1158
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.760
(What do they need to do
for the late-night snack?)

1159
00:44:57.829 --> 00:45:00.530
(The 11 members will receive
the late-night snack...)

1160
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:03.739
(if they move 5 table tennis balls
with chopsticks in 1 minute.)

1161
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.869
- Five table tennis balls?
- It's a piece of cake.

1162
00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:06.940
We just need to stay calm.

1163
00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.579
We should have a chant.
Heave, ho, heave, ho.

1164
00:45:10.579 --> 00:45:12.550
- That's right.
- Since one minute is pretty long,

1165
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.050
- we need to stay calm.
- Let's relax...

1166
00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.719
so that we can eat
sandwiches and fries.

1167
00:45:16.719 --> 00:45:18.150
- Get your chopsticks ready.
- Okay.

1168
00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:20.150
- Start.
- Wait a second.

1169
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.320
- Relax.
- Do it slowly.

1170
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.989
We can do this.

1171
00:45:23.989 --> 00:45:25.760
- Do it slowly.
- It's not a difficult task.

1172
00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.130
- Ho.
- Ho.

1173
00:45:27.429 --> 00:45:28.530
- Heave.
- Heave.

1174
00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:29.860
- Ho.
- Ho.

1175
00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.460
- Wait a second.
- Heave.

1176
00:45:31.699 --> 00:45:33.000
- Ho.
- Ho.

1177
00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.130
- Heave.
- Heave.

1178
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:35.400
Min Hyun is holding chopsticks
in a strange way.

1179
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.869
- My goodness.
- It's okay.

1180
00:45:36.869 --> 00:45:38.670
Min Hyun is holding chopsticks
in a strange way.

1181
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:40.239
- Ho.
- My goodness.

1182
00:45:40.239 --> 00:45:41.239
- It's okay.
- Heave.

1183
00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:42.980
Who was that?
Jae Hwan, stop talking.

1184
00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.079
- Heave.
- Heave.

1185
00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:46.010
Who was that?
Jae Hwan, stop talking.

1186
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.110
Ho.

1187
00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:48.250
Did we get six table tennis balls
in the glass?

1188
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.219
- No.
- We dropped a ball.

1189
00:45:50.219 --> 00:45:51.619
Ho.

1190
00:45:51.619 --> 00:45:52.619
30 second passed.

1191
00:45:52.619 --> 00:45:53.949
- No way!
- Don't get excited.

1192
00:45:53.949 --> 00:45:54.949
Come on.

1193
00:45:54.949 --> 00:45:56.360
- 30 second passed.
- No way.

1194
00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.860
Don't get excited.

1195
00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.260
Heave.

1196
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.090
Ho.

1197
00:46:01.289 --> 00:46:03.559
- 30 second passed.
- No way.

1198
00:46:03.559 --> 00:46:05.670
- We got one ball in the glass.
- Heave.

1199
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:07.469
Ho.

1200
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.039
- Will we succeed?
- My goodness.

1201
00:46:09.039 --> 00:46:11.139
- We got one ball in the glass.
- Ho.

1202
00:46:11.139 --> 00:46:13.309
Don't use
the tip of your chopsticks.

1203
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:14.440
Use the middle part.

1204
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.840
How many balls do we have?

1205
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.110
- Heave.
- Be careful.

1206
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:18.409
My fingers are strained.

1207
00:46:18.449 --> 00:46:20.110
We need to hurry up.

1208
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.980
- We need to hurry up.
- Come on.

1209
00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.650
(The game is almost
coming to an end.)

1210
00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:25.349
Hurry up and get one more ball
in the glass.

1211
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:26.820
Come on.

1212
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.849
Wait a second.

1213
00:46:27.849 --> 00:46:29.119
Come on.

1214
00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.119
Four.

1215
00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:33.460
(Will Wanna One get
the late-night snack?)

1216
00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:34.690
(I really want to eat
sandwiches and fries.)

1217
00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:35.929
(Please)

1218
00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.769
- Wait a second.
- Come on.

1219
00:46:38.769 --> 00:46:39.769
Four.

1220
00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:44.000
Hey!

1221
00:46:44.239 --> 00:46:46.309
(The last member dropped the ball.)

1222
00:46:46.969 --> 00:46:48.610
- One.
- Seong Woo!

1223
00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.840
- For goodness' sake.
- Why do you keep messing it up?

1224
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.150
- Wait a minute.
- Seong Woo!

1225
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:54.110
- For goodness' sake.
- Why do you keep messing it up?

1226
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.849
- For goodness' sake.
- What is wrong with you?

1227
00:46:56.849 --> 00:46:59.019
- For goodness' sake.
- Forget it.

1228
00:46:59.019 --> 00:47:00.650
Leave the room.

1229
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:02.190
- Leave the room.
- Leave.

1230
00:47:02.289 --> 00:47:03.659
Leave.

1231
00:47:03.659 --> 00:47:05.230
Seriously.

1232
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:07.429
It's completely ridiculous.

1233
00:47:07.429 --> 00:47:09.730
- You messed up the first round.
- Are you kidding me?

1234
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:11.000
You messed up the first round.

1235
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.199
Why do you keep messing it up?

1236
00:47:12.199 --> 00:47:14.599
- We only needed one more ball.
- I Am Ground.

1237
00:47:14.599 --> 00:47:17.139
- What is wrong with you?
- Seriously.

1238
00:47:17.139 --> 00:47:18.510
Maybe he is a spy.

1239
00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:21.570
- Maybe Seong Woo is an X-man.
- You are a spy...

1240
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.210
- from the crew, right?
- You are an X-man, right?

1241
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:25.480
- You are an X-man, right?
- Please give us another chance.

1242
00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.780
We will put eight table tennis balls
in the glasses.

1243
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:29.219
A popping performance in pajamas.

1244
00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.980
Seong Woo will give
a popping performance in pajamas.

1245
00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.550
He will dance
to the guitar accompaniment.

1246
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.750
The guitar accompaniment.

1247
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.820
- That's a good idea.
- Since it's a penalty,

1248
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.090
- I will play something great.
- You made a ridiculous mistake.

1249
00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:42.000
Give us a popping performance
to the music.

1250
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.230
(Why is this happening to me?)

1251
00:47:43.329 --> 00:47:45.400
5, 6, 7, 8.

1252
00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:50.170
(It's the new kind of popping.)

1253
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.969
(Laughing)

1254
00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:54.840
- My goodness.
- Why do I feel sad?

1255
00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.409
- My goodness.
- It's hilarious.

1256
00:47:58.409 --> 00:47:59.480
(I have so much respect.)

1257
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:07.449
(The perfect finale)

1258
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.530
- It was great.
- You looked cool.

1259
00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:13.929
Grab the tools.

1260
00:48:13.929 --> 00:48:15.059
Let's eat.

1261
00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:17.329
We have eight balls to move.

1262
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:18.730
I am not good
at using the chopsticks.

1263
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:20.070
Min Hyun holds them
in a strange way.

1264
00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:22.039
We need to drop
less than three balls.

1265
00:48:22.039 --> 00:48:23.739
Min Hyun dropped two balls.

1266
00:48:24.099 --> 00:48:25.809
- Slowly.
- Heave.

1267
00:48:25.809 --> 00:48:26.909
Min Hyun is holding chopsticks
in a strange way.

1268
00:48:26.909 --> 00:48:27.909
- Ho.
- My goodness.

1269
00:48:27.909 --> 00:48:29.510
- It's okay.
- Heave.

1270
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.309
Who was that?
Jae Hwan, stop talking.

1271
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:33.380
(His mind goes blank
after dropping two balls in a row.)

1272
00:48:33.449 --> 00:48:34.780
Then Min Hyun should go first.

1273
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.420
I think that's a good idea.

1274
00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:37.480
Min Hyun should do this.

1275
00:48:38.219 --> 00:48:39.519
(They offer a solution
for Min Hyun.)

1276
00:48:39.519 --> 00:48:41.219
Give Min Hyun a spoon.

1277
00:48:41.219 --> 00:48:43.219
- A spoon?
- Do this.

1278
00:48:43.219 --> 00:48:45.260
Min Hyun can't do it.

1279
00:48:45.559 --> 00:48:47.429
That's why I am worried about him.

1280
00:48:47.429 --> 00:48:49.559
- He keeps struggling.
- Min Hyun.

1281
00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:51.000
He can't use chopsticks very well.

1282
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.199
He is terrible at it.

1283
00:48:52.199 --> 00:48:53.429
Hold chopsticks like this.

1284
00:48:53.429 --> 00:48:55.769
- I can't even copy him.
- Do this instead.

1285
00:48:55.769 --> 00:48:57.940
That's right. When he does that,
pick up the ball.

1286
00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:59.639
Pick up the ball.

1287
00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:01.039
- You know what I mean, right?
- I am bad at this.

1288
00:49:01.539 --> 00:49:03.079
(Will they be able to eat
sandwiches?)

1289
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.780
The paradise of variety shows!

1290
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.650
- Wanna City, let's go!
- Wanna City, let's go!

1291
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:08.719
- We can do this.
- Come on.

1292
00:49:08.719 --> 00:49:09.980
This is the last chance.

1293
00:49:10.619 --> 00:49:11.619
(Are they off to a good start?)

1294
00:49:11.619 --> 00:49:12.849
Let's go.

1295
00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:13.989
All right.

1296
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.389
(He makes the 1st ball.)

1297
00:49:16.659 --> 00:49:17.789
(He drops the 2nd ball.)

1298
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:18.889
For goodness' sake.

1299
00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:21.230
This is driving me insane.

1300
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:23.159
This is driving me insane.

1301
00:49:23.159 --> 00:49:25.269
- Don't let go.
- Ji Sung!

1302
00:49:26.869 --> 00:49:28.300
(He averts his eyes.)

1303
00:49:30.199 --> 00:49:32.809
This is what he does.

1304
00:49:32.909 --> 00:49:34.969
How does he eat?

1305
00:49:34.969 --> 00:49:36.309
Okay, let's go again.

1306
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:38.349
Okay, let's go again.

1307
00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:40.250
Let's go again.

1308
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:42.449
- This is no good.
- This is ridiculous.

1309
00:49:42.449 --> 00:49:44.219
- My goodness.
- Let me eat...

1310
00:49:44.219 --> 00:49:45.449
sandwiches!

1311
00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:46.590
It wasn't my fault, was it?

1312
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:47.619
Let's go again.

1313
00:49:47.619 --> 00:49:49.260
- Let's go again.
- The shoot can't go on forever.

1314
00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:50.559
Please just give us the food.

1315
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.090
Let's go again.

1316
00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:55.230
- Concentrate.
- Stick your chopsticks in there.

1317
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:57.099
Stop talking.

1318
00:49:57.099 --> 00:49:58.500
The paradise of variety shows!

1319
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.329
- Wanna City, let's go!
- Wanna City, let's go!

1320
00:50:00.329 --> 00:50:01.739
Start right away.

1321
00:50:01.739 --> 00:50:04.170
- Come on.
- All right.

1322
00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:07.570
Hold on tight.

1323
00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.480
Be quiet.

1324
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.780
Don't let go too quickly.

1325
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.710
- All right.
- Let's stay on our toes.

1326
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:13.710
All right.

1327
00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:21.590
Okay.

1328
00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:24.219
It's a bit tilted.

1329
00:50:24.219 --> 00:50:25.329
Good job.

1330
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.090
We shouldn't go too fast.

1331
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:29.199
- That's right.
- Okay.

1332
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:30.760
I am sorry.

1333
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:32.130
30 seconds passed.

1334
00:50:33.329 --> 00:50:34.429
Okay, okay.

1335
00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.440
30 seconds passed.

1336
00:50:36.469 --> 00:50:37.570
(So far, they put 3 balls
in the glasses)

1337
00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:38.969
Okay, okay.

1338
00:50:39.539 --> 00:50:40.909
I love that clanking sound.

1339
00:50:40.909 --> 00:50:42.510
My goodness.

1340
00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:44.480
I love that clanking sound.

1341
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.309
- My goodness.
- Calm down.

1342
00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:49.449
- Here.
- Okay.

1343
00:50:49.619 --> 00:50:50.750
Focus.

1344
00:50:50.849 --> 00:50:53.250
(The ace members in moving the balls
are doing an amazing job.)

1345
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.320
Okay.

1346
00:50:54.519 --> 00:50:55.860
Let's stay calm.

1347
00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.860
Okay.

1348
00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.119
(The table tennis balls
find their places with a clank.)

1349
00:50:58.119 --> 00:50:59.130
Okay.

1350
00:51:01.289 --> 00:51:03.760
(Do they have one more ball to go?)

1351
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:05.699
Aren't we done?

1352
00:51:05.699 --> 00:51:07.170
- My goodness.
- Hey!

1353
00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:09.070
- My goodness.
- Hey!

1354
00:51:09.739 --> 00:51:11.599
- Don't get excited.
- Don't get excited.

1355
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:13.139
It's the last one.

1356
00:51:13.139 --> 00:51:15.010
- Don't get excited.
- Don't get excited.

1357
00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:16.840
It's the last one.

1358
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:20.409
(Everyone is watching.)

1359
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:22.550
(He picked it up.)

1360
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.579
There is no ball now.

1361
00:51:24.849 --> 00:51:27.150
- There is no ball now.
- Don't joke around. Put it in.

1362
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.420
Put it in. Put it in.

1363
00:51:29.489 --> 00:51:31.159
Put it in.

1364
00:51:31.929 --> 00:51:35.730
(With the leader's desperate cry,
they succeed in moving 8 balls.)

1365
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.929
(Wanna One won late-night snack.)

1366
00:51:37.929 --> 00:51:39.429
(I love sandwiches.)

1367
00:51:40.429 --> 00:51:41.429
Finally!

1368
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.500
All right.

1369
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:46.409
- Please give us the food.
- We will eat.

1370
00:51:46.409 --> 00:51:48.539
Thank you. Thank you.

1371
00:51:48.909 --> 00:51:49.909
(Congratulations)

1372
00:51:50.579 --> 00:51:51.639
- May we eat?
- Yes.

1373
00:51:51.639 --> 00:51:53.250
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1374
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.449
Thank you for the food.

1375
00:51:54.449 --> 00:51:55.780
- Thank you for the food.
- Sprinkle salt.

1376
00:51:56.579 --> 00:51:58.349
Oh, yes.

1377
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:59.750
Are we sprinkling salt?

1378
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.789
(It looks delicious.)

1379
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.090
My goodness.

1380
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:06.889
Why did you bring forks?

1381
00:52:06.889 --> 00:52:07.889
My goodness.

1382
00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:09.530
This is...

1383
00:52:10.199 --> 00:52:12.369
It's really tasty.

1384
00:52:15.199 --> 00:52:17.840
Let's eat a lot of delicious food
together.

1385
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.039
Let's walk on the path
of delicious food.

1386
00:52:19.039 --> 00:52:20.510
That's the most important thing.

1387
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:22.579
Delicious food trumps
success or money.

1388
00:52:22.579 --> 00:52:23.579
I agree.

1389
00:52:23.909 --> 00:52:25.050
(Wanna City)

1390
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:27.409
Today marks one month of our debut.

1391
00:52:27.409 --> 00:52:28.849
- I see.
- It's meaningful day.

1392
00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:30.150
It felt like
a one-month anniversary party.

1393
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:31.219
- That's right.
- That's right.

1394
00:52:31.219 --> 00:52:33.489
Please invite us back
for this program.

1395
00:52:33.489 --> 00:52:37.489
We will have another season
if we get a lot of views and likes.

1396
00:52:37.719 --> 00:52:38.889
Please press like.

1397
00:52:39.159 --> 00:52:40.230
Please press like.

1398
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:42.530
- Wannable, let's go.
- Please press like.

1399
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:44.800
- Wannable, we want a new season.
- Please press like.

1400
00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.199
The paradise of variety shows!

1401
00:52:46.199 --> 00:52:48.769
- Wanna City, bye!
- Wanna City, bye!

1402
00:52:48.769 --> 00:52:55.440
(It's time to say goodbye
to Wanna City.)

1403
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.440
(The end or not)

1404
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.610
How refreshing!

1405
00:52:59.349 --> 00:53:01.920
I had a lot of fun today.

1406
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.150
The day passed by so quickly
that I regretted not coming earlier.

1407
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:06.349
I had a lot of fun.

1408
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:09.119
I am fascinated
to visit a place like this...

1409
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.190
for a shoot.

1410
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.190
This is a bathtub.

1411
00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:15.230
It's really big, isn't it?

1412
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:17.730
It's my first time
visiting a place like this.

1413
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.570
I had a great day.

1414
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:20.769
I love it here.

1415
00:53:20.769 --> 00:53:22.400
I love this space.

1416
00:53:23.039 --> 00:53:24.599
I am drunk on the atmosphere.

1417
00:53:24.599 --> 00:53:25.739
Does it show?

1418
00:53:25.739 --> 00:53:27.639
I felt comfortable
throughout the shoot.

1419
00:53:27.639 --> 00:53:31.039
This was the first time
I felt so comfortable.

1420
00:53:31.039 --> 00:53:34.849
When would we have a chance
to use a luxury suite?

1421
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.349
I am giving an interview!

1422
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:40.619
I had a lot of fun today.
Yes. Well...

1423
00:53:40.619 --> 00:53:47.860
(He forgot what he wanted to say.)

1424
00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.099
What should I say?

1425
00:53:49.099 --> 00:53:52.670
It was great to have
a healing time with the members.

1426
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:54.199
A month passed since we debuted.

1427
00:53:54.369 --> 00:53:56.539
Since we have a lot of time,

1428
00:53:57.739 --> 00:53:59.710
I hope we would make
fun and nice memories.

1429
00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.510
I want us to build deep friendship.

1430
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.380
I think it's nice...

1431
00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:08.179
to do something with the members.

1432
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:12.050
I want to do more things
with the 11 members.

1433
00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:14.190
I want to make more memories.

1434
00:54:15.219 --> 00:54:17.190
There are many things
we don't know about each other.

1435
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:20.929
(There are many things
we don't know about each other.)

00:54:20.989 --> 00:54:23.230
The fans who love Wanna One,
Wannable,

1437
00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:27.929
it's all thanks
to you that we are here.

1438
00:54:27.929 --> 00:54:31.710
Please continue to cheer for us
by our side.

1439
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:34.239
While we accomplished
many things in a month,

1440
00:54:34.239 --> 00:54:36.539
there are much more we want to show.

1441
00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:38.309
Please look forward
to our future endeavors.

1442
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:41.480
We worked hard
and had fun throughout this shoot.

1443
00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.980
Please send us your love
and watch this program.

1444
00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:47.519
We did our best...

1445
00:54:47.519 --> 00:54:50.659
and worked with the staff
to film this program.

1446
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.460
I hope many people watch it.

1447
00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.030
I am wearing pajamas.

1448
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.400
Dream about me.
Let's go to bed. Bye.

1449
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.670
Good night.

1450
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:02.000
Good night, everyone.

1451
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.039
Good night.

1452
00:55:03.039 --> 00:55:04.139
Bye.

1453
00:55:04.139 --> 00:55:05.340
Good night.

1454
00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:08.139
