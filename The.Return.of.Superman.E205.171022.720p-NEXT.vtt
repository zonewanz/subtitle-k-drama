1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.838
(Parental guidance advised for viewers...)

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.210
(under the age of 12.)

3
00:00:07.391 --> 00:00:09.762
Seo Eon, the security guard is over there.

4
00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:13.631
Let's give him two.

5
00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:16.570
Excuse me.

6
00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:17.902
(What are the twins gifting him?)

7
00:00:18.972 --> 00:00:20.141
Are you here to see me?

8
00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:21.801
Thank you.

9
00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:25.811
During the holidays,

10
00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:27.281
it's customary to gift
rice cakes to people...

11
00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:28.811
you're thankful for.

12
00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:30.612
Who is the most thankful
person in your life?

13
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:33.081
- The security guard.
- Good answer.

14
00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:35.351
- Hold on.
- He's eating it.

15
00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:36.952
What are you doing?

16
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:40.690
Rice cakes for sale.

17
00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:42.161
It's not meant to be sold.

18
00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:43.491
Say, "Have a wonderful day."

19
00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:45.532
Have a wonderful day.

20
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:48.062
(Laughing happily)

21
00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:51.231
Have a wonderful day.

22
00:00:51.232 --> 00:00:53.242
Okay. See you.

23
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.341
The twins...

24
00:00:55.342 --> 00:00:57.272
circle the neighborhood to show gratitude.

25
00:00:57.672 --> 00:00:59.941
- Thank you.
- Is the rice cake for me?

26
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:01.812
Thank you.

27
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:05.150
Have a plentiful Chuseok.

28
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:06.621
Thank you.

29
00:01:07.582 --> 00:01:08.822
Why are you giving these to us?

30
00:01:09.192 --> 00:01:11.691
Our dad told us to hand them out...

31
00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:14.192
to people that we're thankful for.

32
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.332
How sweet of you.

33
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.662
Thank you. We'll enjoy the rice cakes.

34
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:23.132
He's so cute.

35
00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:24.832
Hey, Seo Eon.

36
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:27.071
Come over here.

37
00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:30.371
(They gaze at a building.)

38
00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:33.311
I think it's this one.

39
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.681
I think this is the one.

40
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:39.252
(Where is this place?)

41
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:41.882
(They enter the building first.)

42
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:45.192
(Looking around)

43
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:48.162
Where is the entrance?

44
00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:50.260
Who are you here to see?

45
00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:51.992
Yong Hwa.

46
00:01:53.632 --> 00:01:54.831
Hey, Seo Eon.

47
00:01:54.832 --> 00:01:56.802
(They met by chance on a rainy day.)

48
00:01:56.901 --> 00:02:01.101
(He's kind and handsome.)

49
00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:03.511
(He carried Seo Eon, who was fast asleep.)

50
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:05.811
Is Yong Hwa here?

51
00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:08.082
Did you have an appointment with him?

52
00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:10.811
No, we didn't make one.

53
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:13.981
But we brought these to give to him.

54
00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:15.120
They're rice cakes.

55
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:16.322
Rice cakes?

56
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:19.720
(He picks one up...)

57
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:20.821
(and indifferently tosses it to her.)

58
00:02:20.822 --> 00:02:22.091
Thank you.

59
00:02:23.892 --> 00:02:27.202
(She immediately calls to confirm.)

60
00:02:27.962 --> 00:02:29.802
All right.

61
00:02:31.702 --> 00:02:34.072
Head up to the third-floor workroom.

62
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:35.840
The third floor?

63
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:37.611
Thank you very much.

64
00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:39.212
(Thankfully, Yong Hwa seems to be in.)

65
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:42.552
This is the third floor.

66
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:48.121
Where do we go now?

67
00:02:51.492 --> 00:02:52.521
(Something suddenly
catches Seo Eon's eyes.)

68
00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:55.531
A certain poster catches Seo Eon's eyes.

69
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:57.791
(It's a poster of Yong Hwa.)

70
00:02:57.792 --> 00:02:59.000
Hey, Seo Jun.

71
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:02.202
Do you think that's Yong Hwa?

72
00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:06.471
His hairstyle seems a bit different.

73
00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:10.642
Kids, that's Yong Hwa.

74
00:03:11.272 --> 00:03:13.612
But he seems to have stepped out.

75
00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:15.851
(Hissing)

76
00:03:17.482 --> 00:03:18.551
It's dad.

77
00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:20.881
(That's Hwi Jae's signature hiss.)

78
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:24.351
(Scaring)

79
00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:27.220
(Gosh. How startling.)

80
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:29.931
What are you guys doing here?

81
00:03:30.762 --> 00:03:32.160
What brings you here today?

82
00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:33.832
(Yong Hwa is glad to see them.)

83
00:03:34.302 --> 00:03:37.332
What's the occasion?

84
00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:39.870
(Please receive a rice cake.)

85
00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:41.600
- What is this?
- Rice cake.

86
00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:43.672
- Rice cake?
- Is that for me?

87
00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:45.512
Really?

88
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.780
We're giving it to you...

89
00:03:47.781 --> 00:03:50.711
because we're thankful that you...

90
00:03:50.712 --> 00:03:55.281
kept us safe from the rain last time.

91
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:56.691
You're thankful?

92
00:03:56.792 --> 00:03:59.992
(These little munchkins are praiseworthy.)

93
00:04:01.392 --> 00:04:03.530
The Return of Superman, episode 203.

94
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.462
"Bringing Warmth to One Another".

95
00:04:07.462 --> 00:04:09.000
Seo Jun has returned home.

96
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:10.702
He begins to change.

97
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:14.072
(The little prankster begins to change.)

98
00:04:17.012 --> 00:04:19.911
Now, he changes all on his own.

99
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:24.682
Oh, no. That's a T-shirt.

100
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:28.551
(That's a T-shirt.)

101
00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:31.151
Why is he taking so long to change?

102
00:04:31.822 --> 00:04:33.361
Gosh. He grooms himself now.

103
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:38.262
(That's not why. His pants aren't fitting.)

104
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:42.031
(He makes all sorts of efforts...)

105
00:04:43.772 --> 00:04:45.400
(but eventually fails.)

106
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:47.442
Why are you taking so long?

107
00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:50.171
(Smiling timidly)

108
00:04:50.241 --> 00:04:51.741
Wear these shorts.

109
00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:53.781
Hand that to me.

110
00:04:55.182 --> 00:04:57.980
He still needs a bit of
help from his father.

111
00:04:57.981 --> 00:04:59.861
(He seems all grown-up,
but he's still a baby.)

112
00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:03.521
(Looking about)

113
00:05:03.522 --> 00:05:06.720
Seo Jun searches the
house for something fun.

114
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:08.061
(Is there anything fun to do?)

115
00:05:08.062 --> 00:05:09.931
(He digs into his dad's backpack.)

116
00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:11.061
Seo Eon, rummaging through...

117
00:05:11.062 --> 00:05:12.702
someone else's backpack isn't right.

118
00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:13.861
Okay.

119
00:05:14.062 --> 00:05:15.600
But I'm not Seo Eon.

120
00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:16.772
Seo Jun.

121
00:05:16.832 --> 00:05:18.670
But you're not someone else.

122
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:20.191
(You're not just "someone else", dad.)

123
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:23.110
Hey, don't do that. That's a real baseball.

124
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:25.272
That's very important to me.

125
00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:28.081
(It's very important to you?)

126
00:05:28.082 --> 00:05:29.651
Just rest up, you two.

127
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:32.920
As Hwi Jae leaves the room,

128
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:35.051
the twins begin to move about busily.

129
00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:37.191
They're making me feel a bit uneasy.

130
00:05:37.192 --> 00:05:40.522
(He carries Hwi Jae's
prized signed ball...)

131
00:05:41.322 --> 00:05:43.832
(and slides it underneath the sofa.)

132
00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:47.332
(Goodness)

133
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:54.772
(And Seo Eon hides one behind a door.)

134
00:05:58.142 --> 00:05:59.712
Seo Eon and Seo Jun.

135
00:06:00.611 --> 00:06:02.041
What are you two doing?

136
00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:06.382
(He's looking for a place
to hide the last ball.)

137
00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:11.651
(Where did Seo Jun just remember?)

138
00:06:13.392 --> 00:06:15.561
(He places it on top of
the bathroom cabinet.)

139
00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:18.161
(Risky)

140
00:06:21.361 --> 00:06:23.832
(He's secretive enough to close the door.)

141
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:27.502
(Stomping)

142
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:30.840
(As soon as the door closes, )

143
00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:35.882
(it falls into the toilet.)

144
00:06:40.122 --> 00:06:43.252
(Oh my gosh)

145
00:06:43.822 --> 00:06:45.691
That's very important to me.

146
00:06:45.692 --> 00:06:47.372
(It just happens to fall into the toilet.)

147
00:06:48.361 --> 00:06:50.091
(He hesitates momentarily.)

148
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:53.861
(He pulls out a tissue right away.)

149
00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:58.202
(He fragilely places a
single sheet on top.)

150
00:06:58.872 --> 00:07:01.401
(He attempts to save the
ball with a tissue.)

151
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:03.611
(Fail)

152
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:06.281
(Second attempt, towel)

153
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:08.410
Why isn't it coming out?

154
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:11.051
(It's big enough to cover the toilet.)

155
00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:13.851
(It gets more stuck.)

156
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.921
(He moves to find another tool.)

157
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:20.262
(His presence in the
kitchen is foreboding.)

158
00:07:22.531 --> 00:07:25.091
Oh, no. Don't use a spoon.

159
00:07:25.462 --> 00:07:27.801
(He runs spoon in hand.)

160
00:07:28.832 --> 00:07:31.332
(Seo Jun mischievously uses the spoon.)

161
00:07:34.872 --> 00:07:37.072
(He barely manages to rescue it.)

162
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:41.741
(Running)

163
00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.721
(It's soaked.)

164
00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:53.490
Oh, no.

165
00:07:53.491 --> 00:07:55.220
His mother is going to get shocked.

166
00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:56.661
(He places the spoon right back.)

167
00:07:56.692 --> 00:07:57.931
He placed it right back.

168
00:07:57.932 --> 00:08:00.360
I hid your baseballs.

169
00:08:00.361 --> 00:08:01.731
You can't.

170
00:08:02.572 --> 00:08:04.170
You can't play with those.

171
00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:06.441
That's really important to me.

172
00:08:06.442 --> 00:08:10.211
I'll give you hints.

173
00:08:10.212 --> 00:08:13.241
They're in the bedroom,
playroom, and living room.

174
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:16.980
But it's not in the toilet.

175
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:18.410
What are you talking about?

176
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:20.522
(I want to stay away from Dad right now.)

177
00:08:24.192 --> 00:08:25.290
Yes.

178
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:26.771
(He easily finds the first treasure.)

179
00:08:27.991 --> 00:08:30.161
How many did you hide all together?

180
00:08:31.062 --> 00:08:33.001
Three. Here it is.

181
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:34.801
(He stumbles upon the second treasure.)

182
00:08:34.802 --> 00:08:36.001
You little rascals.

183
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:39.902
The signature belongs to Oh Jae Won.

184
00:08:40.172 --> 00:08:42.811
It's a huge star.

185
00:08:42.812 --> 00:08:44.132
(He boasts about his collection.)

186
00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:46.011
They're invaluable.

187
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:50.412
(The final ball remains.)

188
00:08:52.322 --> 00:08:55.251
He used his head to hide the last one.

189
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:58.322
I found it. Hold on.

190
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:00.591
Why is this so wet?

191
00:09:01.922 --> 00:09:03.590
This is precious to me.

192
00:09:03.591 --> 00:09:06.101
(He wipes it down without a problem.)

193
00:09:06.902 --> 00:09:09.032
Did you toss this into the water?

194
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:12.571
Hey, this was signed by...

195
00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:15.100
Choi Yong Ho. He's very talented.

196
00:09:15.101 --> 00:09:16.840
This is very precious to me.

197
00:09:16.841 --> 00:09:18.010
But why is this so wet?

198
00:09:18.011 --> 00:09:19.281
But...

199
00:09:19.282 --> 00:09:23.781
if I tell you the truth,
will you forgive me?

200
00:09:23.782 --> 00:09:26.082
There's nothing wrong
with it being wet. Why?

201
00:09:27.422 --> 00:09:30.890
Will you forgive me if
I tell you the truth?

202
00:09:30.891 --> 00:09:34.291
(He wants to be affirmed.)

203
00:09:34.292 --> 00:09:35.590
Of course I will.

204
00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:38.032
Then, follow me.

205
00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:40.402
- What?
- Come over here.

206
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:41.501
Why?

207
00:09:41.902 --> 00:09:44.871
I placed it...

208
00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:47.301
up here.

209
00:09:47.302 --> 00:09:49.911
But it rolled and fell in there.

210
00:09:49.912 --> 00:09:52.211
It fell into the toilet?

211
00:09:52.212 --> 00:09:53.341
Did you wash it?

212
00:09:53.442 --> 00:09:54.610
I didn't.

213
00:09:54.611 --> 00:09:55.981
You didn't?

214
00:09:57.712 --> 00:09:59.422
(Sighing)

215
00:10:00.822 --> 00:10:03.251
(He washes his little treasure.)

216
00:10:03.521 --> 00:10:04.721
You little rascals.

217
00:10:06.692 --> 00:10:08.961
How did you take it out?
Did you use your hands?

218
00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:10.791
I scooped it out with a spoon.

219
00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:11.962
Where did that spoon go?

220
00:10:12.962 --> 00:10:14.000
- The spoon?
- Yes.

221
00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:16.032
- To wash it?
- Of course.

222
00:10:16.271 --> 00:10:17.671
Did you wash your hands?

223
00:10:17.672 --> 00:10:18.840
Yes.

224
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:20.471
(He managed to wash his hands.)

225
00:10:22.712 --> 00:10:25.071
Is it this one? Are you sure?

226
00:10:25.072 --> 00:10:26.111
- Yes.
- Gosh.

227
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:28.952
(You can't just only wash that one.)

228
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:31.751
Come over here. Listen well.

229
00:10:31.912 --> 00:10:35.520
Choi Yong Ho is Korea's
greatest home run hitter.

230
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:39.462
- Do you understand?
- Do you love me more...

231
00:10:39.521 --> 00:10:43.091
or the baseball?

232
00:10:43.692 --> 00:10:45.661
Is that even a question?

233
00:10:45.662 --> 00:10:47.901
Of course I love you much more.

234
00:10:47.902 --> 00:10:53.100
I can do anything for you, Seo Jun.

235
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:55.840
Can I drop the baseball
in there one more time?

236
00:10:55.841 --> 00:10:56.870
Where?

237
00:10:56.871 --> 00:10:57.911
The toilet.

238
00:10:57.912 --> 00:11:00.541
You didn't drop it there on purpose, right?

239
00:11:00.542 --> 00:11:01.911
It was a mistake, right?

240
00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:03.110
Then, it's okay.

241
00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:04.582
(It was really a mistake dad.)

242
00:11:05.082 --> 00:11:06.781
Use both your hands.

243
00:11:06.782 --> 00:11:08.302
(Lo Hee begins her morning with golf.)

244
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:13.890
(Hole-in-one)

245
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:16.292
She might really become a golf player.

246
00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:17.630
Where did the ball go?

247
00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:19.101
(The ball rolled under the sofa.)

248
00:11:19.902 --> 00:11:23.271
(She pushes her butt out and searches.)

249
00:11:25.641 --> 00:11:27.601
I found it. It's here.

250
00:11:27.942 --> 00:11:29.011
Is it there?

251
00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:34.082
She just might fit in there.

252
00:11:34.582 --> 00:11:36.480
It rolled under there.

253
00:11:36.481 --> 00:11:38.551
- Shall I help you?
- Yes.

254
00:11:38.552 --> 00:11:40.480
It's out.

255
00:11:40.481 --> 00:11:42.081
(She found it thanks to her dad's help.)

256
00:11:42.292 --> 00:11:44.621
(Something is discomforting her behind.)

257
00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:48.562
I think she keeps getting wedgies.

258
00:11:49.391 --> 00:11:51.591
(Actually...)

259
00:11:52.532 --> 00:11:55.871
(It's been uncomfortable
every time she got up.)

260
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:00.572
(Why is it getting stuck like this?)

261
00:12:00.942 --> 00:12:03.641
- I keep getting wedgies.
- Come here.

262
00:12:03.672 --> 00:12:05.442
Are you getting wedgies?

263
00:12:07.111 --> 00:12:08.811
Lo Hee, you can change into a diaper...

264
00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:11.212
whenever your underwear
feels uncomfortable.

265
00:12:11.312 --> 00:12:12.721
(She's been weaning off diapers.)

266
00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:16.490
But isn't she so cute
with underwear on now?

267
00:12:16.491 --> 00:12:19.391
She's so adorable, right?

268
00:12:20.091 --> 00:12:21.422
But Daddy,

269
00:12:21.822 --> 00:12:25.191
I think my stomach is about to explode.

270
00:12:25.192 --> 00:12:26.832
You're about to explode? Let's go. Hurry.

271
00:12:28.432 --> 00:12:29.601
Push.

272
00:12:30.832 --> 00:12:33.871
Now she's even learning to use the toilet.

273
00:12:34.442 --> 00:12:35.510
Hey, Lo Hee. Are you pooping?

274
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:37.041
(Not so long ago, )

275
00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:40.611
(she used to go on the spot.)

276
00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:44.682
Her diaper days just seem like yesterday.

277
00:12:45.952 --> 00:12:47.850
Even the atmosphere at home is different...

278
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.751
since she grew up.

279
00:12:50.091 --> 00:12:53.391
Hey, Lo Hee. Please give me a massage.

280
00:12:54.121 --> 00:12:56.192
- Are you hurting, Dad?
- Yes.

281
00:12:57.062 --> 00:12:58.760
(She suddenly pulls out a phone.)

282
00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:00.361
Hold this, Daddy.

283
00:13:01.432 --> 00:13:02.672
Hello.

284
00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:04.732
This is Tae Gon's residence, right?

285
00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:06.841
Hold on, Tae Gon.

286
00:13:07.141 --> 00:13:08.572
Here, Lo Hee.

287
00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:10.111
Hey, Tae Gon.

288
00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:12.542
I'm sorry for not making it today.

289
00:13:12.812 --> 00:13:14.712
Let's play together next time.

290
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:17.681
Daddy is sick today.

291
00:13:17.682 --> 00:13:20.251
(Daddy is sick today.)

292
00:13:20.721 --> 00:13:21.850
What did she say?

293
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:23.491
When did I say that I was sick?

294
00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:26.052
Oh, is it because I said
that I was in pain?

295
00:13:26.491 --> 00:13:27.491
Sure.

296
00:13:27.962 --> 00:13:31.361
I'll be looking after him.
See you next time.

297
00:13:32.361 --> 00:13:34.731
(While these two gush over one another, )

298
00:13:36.402 --> 00:13:37.722
(Eugene is focused on something.)

299
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:41.542
Mom must've messed something up again.

300
00:13:41.641 --> 00:13:43.270
That's not it.

301
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:44.511
What is it?

302
00:13:44.672 --> 00:13:47.311
The chocolate melts so fast.

303
00:13:47.312 --> 00:13:48.481
I see.

304
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:50.212
I'm curious.

305
00:13:50.682 --> 00:13:52.381
I'm curious.

306
00:13:53.652 --> 00:13:56.691
(What are you doing, Mommy?)

307
00:13:56.692 --> 00:13:59.491
- What are you making?
- Me?

308
00:14:00.062 --> 00:14:03.332
I'm drawing on a piece of toast.

309
00:14:04.562 --> 00:14:08.302
Toast art is all the
rage online these days.

310
00:14:10.172 --> 00:14:12.770
(A good-looking toast is a tasty toast.)

311
00:14:12.771 --> 00:14:14.942
This is delicate work.

312
00:14:15.812 --> 00:14:18.341
She draws a strawberry with strawberry jam.

313
00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:21.511
And completes the details
with chocolate seeds.

314
00:14:24.582 --> 00:14:27.721
They're Eugene's tasteful toast art.

315
00:14:27.881 --> 00:14:31.491
Children just might enjoy
them better like this.

316
00:14:32.521 --> 00:14:35.562
Would you like to pick, Lo Hee?

317
00:14:36.832 --> 00:14:38.291
I'm going to eat that one.

318
00:14:38.292 --> 00:14:39.962
- This one.
- Is that your favorite?

319
00:14:40.332 --> 00:14:42.671
You pick tasty things so well.

320
00:14:42.672 --> 00:14:44.401
You picked so well.

321
00:14:44.402 --> 00:14:46.501
How did you know that this was yours?

322
00:14:46.672 --> 00:14:48.471
- I know.
- I saw that.

323
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:52.111
- What should we eat now?
- Are you eating this one?

324
00:14:52.741 --> 00:14:54.442
Here's one for you, honey.

325
00:14:54.912 --> 00:14:57.082
I'll give it a try.

326
00:14:59.822 --> 00:15:01.421
(Anticipant)

327
00:15:01.422 --> 00:15:02.621
How does it taste?

328
00:15:03.091 --> 00:15:04.490
- It's so good.
- Is it?

329
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:07.462
- Sure, the jam is good.
- The cherry is alive.

330
00:15:07.861 --> 00:15:09.561
But there's also cream cheese.

331
00:15:09.562 --> 00:15:10.831
(Explosion of compliments)

332
00:15:10.832 --> 00:15:12.101
It's so good.

333
00:15:13.562 --> 00:15:15.471
(Exclaiming)

334
00:15:17.072 --> 00:15:18.370
(Positive reactions abound)

335
00:15:18.371 --> 00:15:19.541
This is so good.

336
00:15:19.542 --> 00:15:21.441
- Try this with jam.
- Try it.

337
00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:23.311
(Lo Hee takes a bite too.)

338
00:15:23.312 --> 00:15:25.271
The jam is sweet and tasty.

339
00:15:28.812 --> 00:15:30.152
Give mommy a kiss.

340
00:15:30.452 --> 00:15:32.581
I can't because chocolate
is smeared on my lips.

341
00:15:32.582 --> 00:15:33.682
That's okay.

342
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:35.552
How nice.

343
00:15:36.391 --> 00:15:37.922
It's smeared.

344
00:15:39.121 --> 00:15:41.260
- Chocolate is smeared.
- That's why you can't?

345
00:15:41.261 --> 00:15:42.562
Mommy is fine with it.

346
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:47.402
Now, wipe your lips. It's all over it.

347
00:15:47.432 --> 00:15:49.432
You can wipe this on your mouth.

348
00:15:49.572 --> 00:15:50.672
Hey, Lo Hee.

349
00:15:51.202 --> 00:15:52.942
What did mommy say about this?

350
00:15:53.702 --> 00:15:56.071
- It's a waste.
- You're correct.

351
00:15:56.072 --> 00:15:58.212
Throwing away something new is a waste.

352
00:15:58.312 --> 00:16:00.441
- I really...
- She knows the meaning.

353
00:16:00.442 --> 00:16:03.181
- Love...
- You can't waste, okay?

354
00:16:03.182 --> 00:16:04.281
Our Lo Hee.

355
00:16:04.282 --> 00:16:06.421
Excuse me, Dad.

356
00:16:06.422 --> 00:16:07.782
(Excuse me, Dad.)

357
00:16:10.652 --> 00:16:12.962
(She asks him to move aside.)

358
00:16:15.631 --> 00:16:17.091
Watch this, Mommy.

359
00:16:17.162 --> 00:16:18.802
Daddy is exercising.

360
00:16:19.402 --> 00:16:22.302
(Tae Young begins to
show off his strength.)

361
00:16:22.902 --> 00:16:24.072
Eugene.

362
00:16:24.402 --> 00:16:25.470
Eugene.

363
00:16:25.471 --> 00:16:26.672
Don't get on.

364
00:16:26.871 --> 00:16:28.202
- What about me?
- Don't get on.

365
00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:33.782
One. You count "three", Lo Hee.

366
00:16:34.542 --> 00:16:36.912
One. Back to one.

367
00:16:36.952 --> 00:16:39.121
- Two.
- I'm struggling.

368
00:16:39.282 --> 00:16:40.321
Three.

369
00:16:40.322 --> 00:16:42.422
She said you can. Go back down. Three.

370
00:16:43.292 --> 00:16:45.422
- On your knees then.
- Four.

371
00:16:45.562 --> 00:16:46.692
Four.

372
00:16:46.721 --> 00:16:48.161
Pride won't allow you, right?

373
00:16:48.162 --> 00:16:49.192
No.

374
00:16:50.532 --> 00:16:52.832
- I can touch too.
- You can touch.

375
00:16:54.332 --> 00:16:57.032
Lo Hee, daddy is still alive.

376
00:16:57.572 --> 00:16:59.902
Daddy, crawl forward.

377
00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:01.600
- She wants you to go.
- Crawl there?

378
00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:03.611
(Tae Young must do as he's told.)

379
00:17:03.612 --> 00:17:06.010
Daddy is suddenly exercising again.

380
00:17:06.011 --> 00:17:07.310
(He does as he's told.)

381
00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:09.152
My muscles are sore.

382
00:17:12.251 --> 00:17:13.921
(She hops off dexterously.)

383
00:17:13.922 --> 00:17:16.622
All done. Lo Hee, you
have to pay your fare.

384
00:17:18.251 --> 00:17:20.061
Thank you.

385
00:17:20.221 --> 00:17:21.362
I only get words?

386
00:17:21.721 --> 00:17:22.731
Yes.

387
00:17:23.662 --> 00:17:25.760
Thank you very much.

388
00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:27.530
(Walking away)

389
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:29.471
My heart aches.

390
00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.172
My heart is aching.

391
00:17:32.402 --> 00:17:34.372
What are you doing there, Lo Hee?

392
00:17:34.942 --> 00:17:36.372
I'm hiding.

393
00:17:37.471 --> 00:17:39.480
That's hiding?

394
00:17:39.481 --> 00:17:41.057
(All she needs to do is cover her head.)

395
00:17:41.081 --> 00:17:42.382
I'll bring new Moi over.

396
00:17:42.452 --> 00:17:44.652
- Hey, Lo Hee.
- Where's the new Moi?

397
00:17:44.882 --> 00:17:46.422
Is that the older one?

398
00:17:47.281 --> 00:17:49.621
- Hey, Lo Hee.
- It's so interesting...

399
00:17:49.622 --> 00:17:51.422
to see her distinguish between the two.

400
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:53.962
Which one is the new Moi?

401
00:17:54.021 --> 00:17:55.961
This one's the new one.

402
00:17:55.962 --> 00:17:57.291
Really? Let's see.

403
00:17:58.162 --> 00:18:01.202
Lo Hee actually owns two Moi dolls.

404
00:18:01.402 --> 00:18:04.001
We thought she lost the old one.

405
00:18:04.301 --> 00:18:06.801
So her aunt bought her a new one.

406
00:18:06.942 --> 00:18:09.271
But over time,

407
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:12.341
the texture, feel, and appearance...

408
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.241
began to look the same.

409
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:16.881
(Lo Hee distinguishes the two dolls.)

410
00:18:16.882 --> 00:18:18.182
Which one is the new Moi?

411
00:18:18.652 --> 00:18:21.250
(Which is it?)

412
00:18:21.251 --> 00:18:22.951
Now, which one is the new Moi?

413
00:18:22.952 --> 00:18:24.852
(Which will she choose?)

414
00:18:25.152 --> 00:18:27.362
This one's new, and that one's old.

415
00:18:27.892 --> 00:18:30.261
This one's new, and that one's old.

416
00:18:30.432 --> 00:18:32.432
(They have to look at the tags to confirm.)

417
00:18:33.432 --> 00:18:34.501
She's right.

418
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:36.131
How do you know?

419
00:18:36.132 --> 00:18:38.632
Close your eyes.

420
00:18:38.771 --> 00:18:39.771
Close your eyes and feel them.

421
00:18:39.772 --> 00:18:42.740
Guess which one is which.

422
00:18:42.741 --> 00:18:43.770
(She must choose based on feel and scent.)

423
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:45.642
This one might be difficult.

424
00:18:45.912 --> 00:18:48.781
Will she be able to guess on feel alone?

425
00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:54.122
This one is new, and that one is old.

426
00:18:55.182 --> 00:18:56.352
She's right.

427
00:18:59.662 --> 00:19:00.861
(Correct again)

428
00:19:00.862 --> 00:19:02.491
How can you tell, Lo Hee?

429
00:19:02.862 --> 00:19:05.531
- I'm so curious.
- How do you know?

430
00:19:05.602 --> 00:19:08.202
How can you tell? They're the same.

431
00:19:08.462 --> 00:19:10.231
They even feel the same.

432
00:19:10.372 --> 00:19:12.942
It has to be different.
She closed her eyes.

433
00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.300
She has never guessed incorrectly.

434
00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:16.712
It's a mystery.

435
00:19:16.971 --> 00:19:19.611
- It's really a mystery.
- It really is.

436
00:19:19.612 --> 00:19:21.682
(We are soulmates.)

437
00:19:22.712 --> 00:19:24.852
Where are we going, Lo Hee?

438
00:19:25.682 --> 00:19:27.821
- Hello.
- Hello there.

439
00:19:28.122 --> 00:19:29.791
Hi, Lo Hee.

440
00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:33.691
She's the hair stylist for
Korea's top actresses,

441
00:19:33.692 --> 00:19:35.291
Cha Hong.

442
00:19:36.932 --> 00:19:41.101
(She's familiar with
giving public advice too.)

443
00:19:41.102 --> 00:19:42.500
- Can I take it off?
- Yes.

444
00:19:42.501 --> 00:19:46.442
(This intern is here to
learn from the best.)

445
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:48.001
How pretty.

446
00:19:48.071 --> 00:19:50.740
You're very good...

447
00:19:50.741 --> 00:19:52.511
- at styling her hair.
- Really?

448
00:19:53.781 --> 00:19:56.511
- I'm not so sure.
- You're good.

449
00:19:57.511 --> 00:20:00.321
(Tae Young is Lo Hee's exclusive stylist.)

450
00:20:02.721 --> 00:20:04.921
This is more than enough talent.

451
00:20:04.922 --> 00:20:06.891
- He's so competent.
- The "Pippi" style...

452
00:20:06.892 --> 00:20:08.591
is difficult for men...

453
00:20:08.592 --> 00:20:09.931
because their hands are too big.

454
00:20:09.932 --> 00:20:12.031
Hair bands for babies are very tiny.

455
00:20:12.761 --> 00:20:15.902
This actually looks great on Lo Hee too.

456
00:20:16.172 --> 00:20:19.241
It's perfectly fine. Part
her hair to the side.

457
00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:20.601
(Lo Hee's style, picking sunflowers)

458
00:20:20.602 --> 00:20:22.612
Bring one side over.

459
00:20:23.212 --> 00:20:26.412
- Then, braid. Can you?
- Yes.

460
00:20:26.781 --> 00:20:29.581
Really? Men usually can't.

461
00:20:29.751 --> 00:20:33.281
You braid backwards.

462
00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:35.991
- Backwards?
- Yes, like this.

463
00:20:36.551 --> 00:20:38.622
Just give her a slight braid.

464
00:20:39.491 --> 00:20:40.922
It's so pretty, Lo Hee.

465
00:20:40.991 --> 00:20:43.391
Just like this. At the final part,

466
00:20:43.392 --> 00:20:45.702
Just tuck it back in like this.

467
00:20:46.001 --> 00:20:48.161
Once you do that, - It's so pretty.

468
00:20:48.162 --> 00:20:50.331
Give the top a tug.

469
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:52.342
Lo Hee, look at me.

470
00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:53.702
It's pretty.

471
00:20:54.142 --> 00:20:57.442
The new style is saved
inside Tae Young's head.

472
00:20:57.811 --> 00:20:58.981
Take a seat here.

473
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:01.212
It's time to cut your hair.

474
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:03.681
- It's time to cut.
- Put your arms in.

475
00:21:03.682 --> 00:21:05.520
It's emotionally healthy for children...

476
00:21:05.521 --> 00:21:07.382
for their parents to cut their hair.

477
00:21:07.922 --> 00:21:09.991
Tae Young will personally cut her hair?

478
00:21:10.821 --> 00:21:12.938
You don't necessarily have
to use this type of brush.

479
00:21:12.962 --> 00:21:14.522
(The intern begins his field training.)

480
00:21:17.592 --> 00:21:19.201
(Cha Hong is also nervous.)

481
00:21:19.202 --> 00:21:21.201
Good. You did well.

482
00:21:21.202 --> 00:21:22.230
All right.

483
00:21:22.231 --> 00:21:25.031
Now, twist it once.

484
00:21:25.642 --> 00:21:28.771
Like how you learned.
You're doing very well.

485
00:21:29.342 --> 00:21:32.612
- Now, cut the center.
- Okay.

486
00:21:32.712 --> 00:21:34.741
That's why it was so straight.

487
00:21:35.751 --> 00:21:37.181
(Trembling)

488
00:21:37.182 --> 00:21:39.221
- My hand is shaking.
- I'm nervous.

489
00:21:40.682 --> 00:21:43.491
(He focuses intently on the snipping.)

490
00:21:44.791 --> 00:21:46.790
(How will Lo Hee's hair look?)

491
00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:48.520
- It's done.
- Was it too much?

492
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:50.961
No, I think you did a good job.
Shall we look?

493
00:21:50.962 --> 00:21:53.201
Ta-da.

494
00:21:53.202 --> 00:21:54.531
(Ta-da)

495
00:21:54.702 --> 00:21:56.230
- The ends are longer.
- They are, right?

496
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:58.402
- Yes.
- You did a good job.

497
00:21:59.102 --> 00:22:01.270
- It's pretty, right?
- Yes.

498
00:22:01.271 --> 00:22:02.271
Lo Hee.

499
00:22:02.272 --> 00:22:04.510
These bangs are comfortable...

500
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:05.711
for children.

501
00:22:05.712 --> 00:22:07.810
They accentuate the children's faces.

502
00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:08.882
I see.

503
00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:10.080
That's right.

504
00:22:10.081 --> 00:22:11.112
(Tilting her head)

505
00:22:11.212 --> 00:22:12.750
(Dad, you are pretty good.)

506
00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:14.951
Straight bangs are okay,
but these are better.

507
00:22:14.952 --> 00:22:16.891
This part is shorter. All right.

508
00:22:16.892 --> 00:22:18.821
- You get it, right?
- Yes.

509
00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:20.561
Good job.

510
00:22:22.561 --> 00:22:23.691
- Good job.
- Good job.

511
00:22:23.692 --> 00:22:24.961
- You speak English well.
- Good job.

512
00:22:24.962 --> 00:22:28.931
To add volume to the bangs,

513
00:22:28.932 --> 00:22:30.431
you can use toilet paper.

514
00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:32.171
- Toilet paper?
- If you are on a trip,

515
00:22:32.172 --> 00:22:34.970
grab the bangs...

516
00:22:34.971 --> 00:22:37.770
and roll them up with toilet paper.

517
00:22:37.771 --> 00:22:38.942
My goodness.

518
00:22:39.182 --> 00:22:41.010
- My goodness.
- Roll them up...

519
00:22:41.011 --> 00:22:42.351
- like this.
- You roll them up.

520
00:22:42.352 --> 00:22:44.681
Roll them up like this.

521
00:22:44.682 --> 00:22:47.051
My goodness, what is this?

522
00:22:47.382 --> 00:22:50.291
It looks like a marshmallow.

523
00:22:51.751 --> 00:22:52.790
Look at this.

524
00:22:52.791 --> 00:22:55.561
Secure it with a small pin.

525
00:22:56.662 --> 00:22:59.001
Lo Hee.

526
00:23:00.432 --> 00:23:02.471
- What is going on?
- My goodness.

527
00:23:03.402 --> 00:23:04.871
(Aunt Bada appears.)

528
00:23:04.872 --> 00:23:09.411
I thought you were an employee.

529
00:23:09.412 --> 00:23:11.212
You look really young.

530
00:23:11.672 --> 00:23:12.681
(Why are you here?)

531
00:23:12.682 --> 00:23:14.942
- Do you use this salon?
- Yes, I do.

532
00:23:15.112 --> 00:23:16.852
I see.

533
00:23:17.011 --> 00:23:19.351
I cut Lo Hee's bangs.

534
00:23:19.352 --> 00:23:22.092
Look at the bangs he cut.

535
00:23:22.452 --> 00:23:24.392
- My goodness.
- He cut them.

536
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:27.591
My goodness, you look like Ja Doo.

537
00:23:27.592 --> 00:23:29.830
- Ja Doo!
- You look like Ja Doo.

538
00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:31.091
- Ja Doo!
- How cute!

539
00:23:31.092 --> 00:23:32.462
(Hello, Lo Hee and Ja Doo.)

540
00:23:32.632 --> 00:23:34.701
It adds volume to her bangs.

541
00:23:34.702 --> 00:23:36.501
How are you so good at this?

542
00:23:36.801 --> 00:23:39.171
- Is this your new job?
- No, it's not.

543
00:23:39.172 --> 00:23:41.970
Lo Hee looks more feminine with curly hair.

544
00:23:41.971 --> 00:23:43.511
My goodness.

545
00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:45.142
Lo Hee, I am leaving.

546
00:23:45.481 --> 00:23:47.142
Whose car are you riding?

547
00:23:47.311 --> 00:23:48.612
Whose car am I riding?

548
00:23:48.682 --> 00:23:51.111
I am riding my own car.
Do you want to ride it?

549
00:23:51.112 --> 00:23:52.951
- Let's see you again.
- I want to go with you.

550
00:23:52.952 --> 00:23:55.321
Lo Hee, you want to go with me?

551
00:23:55.852 --> 00:23:56.891
- I will get going.
- Bye.

552
00:23:56.892 --> 00:23:58.550
- See you next time.
- Bye.

553
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:00.020
Lo Hee, I will get going.

554
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:01.692
(See you again, Aunt Bada.)

555
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:04.891
- Thank you so much.
- Dad.

556
00:24:04.892 --> 00:24:06.530
I will be able to use...

557
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:08.560
what I learned today.

558
00:24:08.561 --> 00:24:10.830
Her bangs are very pretty.

559
00:24:10.831 --> 00:24:11.951
- Yes, they are.
- Dad, Dad.

560
00:24:13.442 --> 00:24:15.570
Today... Look.

561
00:24:15.571 --> 00:24:17.211
(Si An is getting his hair done as well.)

562
00:24:17.511 --> 00:24:19.612
You need to look cool today.

563
00:24:20.112 --> 00:24:22.351
Do you want to part your hair?

564
00:24:22.352 --> 00:24:23.652
(What is happening today?)

565
00:24:25.882 --> 00:24:28.182
(Dong Gook is using his skills.)

566
00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:30.692
Look, Si An.

567
00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:34.691
Si An, look.

568
00:24:34.692 --> 00:24:36.191
(He will follow the right path.)

569
00:24:36.192 --> 00:24:37.631
You look cool.

570
00:24:37.632 --> 00:24:39.331
Si An, you just need to wait like this.

571
00:24:39.731 --> 00:24:41.260
When he comes back from school,

572
00:24:41.261 --> 00:24:43.300
he talks about Min Chae from time to time.

573
00:24:43.301 --> 00:24:46.271
Since we moved to a new house,

574
00:24:46.571 --> 00:24:48.401
I invited...

575
00:24:48.402 --> 00:24:51.740
Si An's first girlfriend...

576
00:24:51.741 --> 00:24:53.942
to a housewarming party.

577
00:24:55.712 --> 00:24:57.151
You need to look at it from afar.

578
00:24:57.152 --> 00:24:58.592
What do you think of your hairstyle?

579
00:24:59.251 --> 00:25:00.780
What do you think?

580
00:25:00.781 --> 00:25:02.821
How will it feel to look
this way before Min Chae?

581
00:25:03.192 --> 00:25:04.790
I would be embarrassed.

582
00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:06.761
Don't you like this hairstyle?

583
00:25:07.721 --> 00:25:09.692
- No? No?
- Let's go.

584
00:25:10.261 --> 00:25:12.760
Give me a different hairstyle.

585
00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:13.961
A different hairstyle?

586
00:25:13.962 --> 00:25:15.061
- Yes.
- Which one?

587
00:25:15.672 --> 00:25:17.800
I think this hairstyle is nice. Let's see.

588
00:25:17.801 --> 00:25:20.901
(He lets his dad play with his hair again.)

589
00:25:20.902 --> 00:25:23.771
Si An, go and look at the mirror.

590
00:25:23.872 --> 00:25:25.310
Tell me if you like it.

591
00:25:25.311 --> 00:25:27.111
(Will he like it?)

592
00:25:27.112 --> 00:25:28.612
(He is smiling suspiciously.)

593
00:25:34.751 --> 00:25:37.651
(He looks like he is ready to sing a song.)

594
00:25:37.652 --> 00:25:39.862
I don't want this hairstyle.

595
00:25:40.291 --> 00:25:42.260
All right. Come here.

596
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:44.091
(Will you stop it?)

597
00:25:44.092 --> 00:25:45.361
Here is a brush.

598
00:25:45.362 --> 00:25:49.270
I want your hairstyle.

599
00:25:49.271 --> 00:25:51.401
- My hairstyle?
- Your hairstyle.

600
00:25:51.402 --> 00:25:52.671
My hairstyle.

601
00:25:52.672 --> 00:25:55.040
Let's pull back your hair in a natural way.

602
00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:57.571
Don't touch your hair. Go and look.

603
00:26:00.682 --> 00:26:02.882
(He feels powerful.)

604
00:26:10.721 --> 00:26:13.662
(My goodness.)

605
00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:16.392
This isn't it.

606
00:26:18.862 --> 00:26:20.961
This isn't it.

607
00:26:20.962 --> 00:26:22.971
Which hairstyle do you want?

608
00:26:23.602 --> 00:26:24.770
Which hairstyle do you want?

609
00:26:24.771 --> 00:26:26.602
(Disheartened)

610
00:26:28.602 --> 00:26:30.041
Are you parting your hair?

611
00:26:31.442 --> 00:26:33.441
Min Chae will be scared to see you.

612
00:26:33.442 --> 00:26:35.550
She will be scared to see...

613
00:26:35.551 --> 00:26:37.581
that you parted your hair like delinquents.

614
00:26:37.981 --> 00:26:40.020
Si An, this hairstyle
works the best for you.

615
00:26:40.021 --> 00:26:45.092
I want to wear a princely outfit.

616
00:26:45.592 --> 00:26:46.862
- Really?
- Yes.

617
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:49.191
Is it because Min Chae is coming?

618
00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:50.192
Yes.

619
00:26:50.193 --> 00:26:53.161
Si An, there is a cool outfit.

620
00:26:53.162 --> 00:26:54.522
Let's go and put on a cool outfit.

621
00:26:54.602 --> 00:26:56.131
(Shouting)

622
00:26:56.132 --> 00:26:57.271
This way.

623
00:26:58.942 --> 00:27:00.902
(What is Si An's princely outfit?)

624
00:27:05.071 --> 00:27:07.941
You want to look cool in front of Min Chae.

625
00:27:07.942 --> 00:27:08.951
Yes.

626
00:27:08.952 --> 00:27:11.581
Make me look cool, Dad.

627
00:27:12.652 --> 00:27:15.182
(He wears a cute bow tie.)

628
00:27:15.521 --> 00:27:18.021
Let's wear this.

629
00:27:20.422 --> 00:27:21.990
(Si An's fashion surprises Dong Gook.)

630
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:23.362
- Dad.
- Si An.

631
00:27:25.331 --> 00:27:26.932
He transformed into a gentleman.

632
00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:29.602
Si An looks cool.

633
00:27:30.202 --> 00:27:31.570
Si An, sit down.

634
00:27:31.571 --> 00:27:33.342
(Si An, the gentleman)

635
00:27:36.011 --> 00:27:38.470
Does Si An look cool?

636
00:27:38.471 --> 00:27:39.841
He looks cool.

637
00:27:39.842 --> 00:27:42.712
He looks like a magician.

638
00:27:43.152 --> 00:27:45.151
(Like magic, Si An became cooler.)

639
00:27:45.152 --> 00:27:46.580
- Si An.
- Yes?

640
00:27:46.581 --> 00:27:48.952
I have never met Min Chae.
What is she like?

641
00:27:49.321 --> 00:27:51.220
She is very pretty.

642
00:27:51.221 --> 00:27:53.192
(He is very serious.)

643
00:27:53.761 --> 00:27:54.990
Is Min Chae pretty?

644
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:56.091
Yes.

645
00:27:56.092 --> 00:27:57.891
You must always carry...

646
00:27:57.892 --> 00:27:58.961
- a handkerchief.
- Okay.

647
00:27:58.962 --> 00:28:01.462
When a woman cries, wipe
her tears with this.

648
00:28:01.962 --> 00:28:03.131
- Okay?
- Okay.

649
00:28:03.132 --> 00:28:06.142
When a woman sits down, lay it down.

650
00:28:06.442 --> 00:28:07.471
Okay.

651
00:28:08.172 --> 00:28:09.470
Min Chae is here.

652
00:28:09.471 --> 00:28:11.672
Min Chae is here.

653
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:14.641
- Seol A and Soo A.
- Min Chae.

654
00:28:14.642 --> 00:28:16.051
(I haven't looked at a mirror yet.)

655
00:28:16.452 --> 00:28:17.551
(Did Min Chae come?)

656
00:28:17.852 --> 00:28:20.351
- It's me.
- It's me.

657
00:28:20.352 --> 00:28:22.750
They are your sisters.

658
00:28:22.751 --> 00:28:24.520
Why is Si An wearing a tuxedo?

659
00:28:24.521 --> 00:28:27.691
Si An's girlfriend is coming.

660
00:28:27.692 --> 00:28:30.432
Seol A and Soo A ran when the door opened.

661
00:28:30.761 --> 00:28:34.161
Si An became cool.

662
00:28:34.162 --> 00:28:35.470
Men should be like that.

663
00:28:35.471 --> 00:28:36.902
(Since he decided to be cool, )

664
00:28:38.102 --> 00:28:39.470
(he shows off his killer moves.)

665
00:28:39.471 --> 00:28:41.571
- How cool!
- How cool!

666
00:28:42.172 --> 00:28:44.810
(It's excessive.)

667
00:28:44.811 --> 00:28:46.381
Si An, is Min Chae pretty?

668
00:28:46.382 --> 00:28:48.412
(Si An, is Min Chae pretty?)

669
00:28:48.541 --> 00:28:49.580
Yes.

670
00:28:49.581 --> 00:28:50.980
Who is prettier, Min Chae or Seol A?

671
00:28:50.981 --> 00:28:53.321
(The moment has come.)

672
00:28:53.852 --> 00:28:56.021
- Sit down.
- Min...

673
00:28:56.321 --> 00:28:57.622
Seol A.

674
00:28:58.551 --> 00:29:01.361
"Min... Seol A".

675
00:29:01.362 --> 00:29:03.731
Who do you like better, me or Min Chae?

676
00:29:04.092 --> 00:29:06.060
- Soo A.
- All right.

677
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:07.661
Who do you like better, Dad or Min Chae?

678
00:29:08.132 --> 00:29:11.201
Listen, when Min Chae comes,

679
00:29:11.202 --> 00:29:12.872
he will say he likes Min Chae better.

680
00:29:13.342 --> 00:29:15.942
(Stop asking me questions.)

681
00:29:16.842 --> 00:29:18.781
(He runs to the front door.)

682
00:29:19.011 --> 00:29:20.511
Is Min Chae coming?

683
00:29:21.281 --> 00:29:23.250
She should be here any minute.

684
00:29:23.251 --> 00:29:25.281
Min Chae, come quickly.

685
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:30.651
(Will I hear Min Chae's footsteps?)

686
00:29:30.652 --> 00:29:33.122
I hear Min Chae's footsteps.

687
00:29:34.392 --> 00:29:36.030
When will she come?

688
00:29:36.031 --> 00:29:39.030
(When will she come?)

689
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:42.632
I want to see Min Chae.

690
00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:49.741
(He eagerly waits for Min Chae.)

691
00:29:49.942 --> 00:29:51.641
Min Chae, come quickly.

692
00:29:51.642 --> 00:29:53.141
(Min Chae, do you hear my voice?)

693
00:29:53.142 --> 00:29:54.912
Min Chae, come quickly.

694
00:29:55.712 --> 00:29:59.182
Min Chae, come quickly.

695
00:29:59.352 --> 00:30:02.221
You are like a stone statue,

696
00:30:02.452 --> 00:30:03.550
Si An.

697
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:04.852
Hurry up.

698
00:30:05.922 --> 00:30:07.220
Si An, open the door.

699
00:30:07.221 --> 00:30:08.662
(Ringing)

700
00:30:09.231 --> 00:30:10.331
She is here.

701
00:30:10.731 --> 00:30:12.402
(She is finally here.)

702
00:30:13.202 --> 00:30:16.331
(They waited a long time
for Si An's girlfriend.)

703
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:20.540
- Hello.
- Si An.

704
00:30:20.541 --> 00:30:22.212
She is finally here.

705
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:23.741
Si An.

706
00:30:24.142 --> 00:30:25.882
Min Chae is here.

707
00:30:26.612 --> 00:30:29.852
This is Min Chae, Si An's girlfriend.

708
00:30:30.551 --> 00:30:33.622
They are friends who smile
when they are together,

709
00:30:33.751 --> 00:30:35.182
Si An and Min Chae.

710
00:30:35.692 --> 00:30:37.351
Welcome, Min Chae.

711
00:30:37.352 --> 00:30:38.861
(Si An's first girlfriend
visits the house.)

712
00:30:38.862 --> 00:30:40.191
Hello.

713
00:30:40.192 --> 00:30:42.431
I will give you a call.

714
00:30:42.432 --> 00:30:44.391
- All right.
- You startled me.

715
00:30:44.392 --> 00:30:45.801
(You startled me.)

716
00:30:47.462 --> 00:30:50.831
(Si An has 4 sisters.)

717
00:30:51.872 --> 00:30:53.501
You startled me.

718
00:30:53.942 --> 00:30:55.041
Hello.

719
00:30:55.412 --> 00:30:57.871
Welcome.

720
00:30:57.872 --> 00:30:59.382
(Min Chae is a sheep to their eyes.)

721
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:02.311
(Si An is extremely excited.)

722
00:31:03.412 --> 00:31:05.721
- Hello, Min Chae.
- Hello.

723
00:31:08.991 --> 00:31:11.952
(His heart pounds.)

724
00:31:12.321 --> 00:31:16.731
(He wants to say something.)

725
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:19.361
Do I look cool?

726
00:31:19.362 --> 00:31:22.730
(It's a rash question.)

727
00:31:22.731 --> 00:31:24.971
(Well...)

728
00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:27.300
I guess your outfit is excessive.

729
00:31:27.301 --> 00:31:28.971
Si An, I guess your outfit is excessive.

730
00:31:29.672 --> 00:31:31.111
She didn't know what to say.

731
00:31:31.112 --> 00:31:33.040
I guess your outfit is excessive.

732
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:34.741
(It's a look she isn't familiar with.)

733
00:31:36.882 --> 00:31:39.952
(The four sisters make her uncomfortable.)

734
00:31:40.122 --> 00:31:42.651
Min Chae, how old are you?

735
00:31:42.652 --> 00:31:43.721
I am four years old.

736
00:31:43.922 --> 00:31:46.560
That makes you my friend.

737
00:31:46.561 --> 00:31:47.721
You are the same age.

738
00:31:47.821 --> 00:31:49.461
You are the same age as Si An.

739
00:31:49.462 --> 00:31:52.561
Do you have siblings?

740
00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:54.500
- No.
- My goodness.

741
00:31:54.501 --> 00:31:55.931
(Min Chae is an only daughter.)

742
00:31:55.932 --> 00:31:57.471
She is an only child.

743
00:31:57.771 --> 00:31:59.500
Min Chae, I am sorry,

744
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:01.672
but Si An has four sisters.

745
00:32:01.842 --> 00:32:03.010
It's okay, right?

746
00:32:03.011 --> 00:32:04.412
(It's okay.)

747
00:32:04.541 --> 00:32:07.412
Is Si An cool?

748
00:32:07.612 --> 00:32:09.010
Si An is very funny.

749
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:10.250
Is Si An very funny?

750
00:32:10.251 --> 00:32:12.351
- Is he funny?
- Is he funny?

751
00:32:12.352 --> 00:32:14.480
What is he like at school? Is he funny?

752
00:32:14.481 --> 00:32:16.521
What is he like at school?

753
00:32:17.051 --> 00:32:19.991
(I will show you how funny I am.)

754
00:32:20.561 --> 00:32:23.092
A ball! A ball!

755
00:32:24.392 --> 00:32:28.432
(The four-year-old likes slapstick comedy.)

756
00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:32.401
Si An, show your room...

757
00:32:32.402 --> 00:32:34.341
to Min Chae.

758
00:32:34.342 --> 00:32:35.941
You should do that. Si An and Min Chae.

759
00:32:35.942 --> 00:32:37.810
- Bye.
- Bye.

760
00:32:37.811 --> 00:32:39.010
It looks like they are going on a trip.

761
00:32:39.011 --> 00:32:40.581
You don't have to hold hands.

762
00:32:42.311 --> 00:32:43.810
Ta-da!

763
00:32:43.811 --> 00:32:45.520
Is this your room?

764
00:32:45.521 --> 00:32:46.551
Yes.

765
00:32:48.581 --> 00:32:50.050
I want to sit here.

766
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:51.192
Seol A.

767
00:32:51.521 --> 00:32:52.691
(Si An takes something out.)

768
00:32:52.692 --> 00:32:54.162
Min Chae.

769
00:32:54.761 --> 00:32:56.990
(Seol A is taken away.)

770
00:32:56.991 --> 00:32:58.592
Min Chae.

771
00:32:58.962 --> 00:33:00.561
What is that?

772
00:33:01.132 --> 00:33:02.901
It's something you like.

773
00:33:02.902 --> 00:33:04.001
What is that?

774
00:33:04.402 --> 00:33:06.142
How pretty!

775
00:33:06.541 --> 00:33:08.810
It's something I like.

776
00:33:08.811 --> 00:33:11.311
Are these earrings?

777
00:33:12.712 --> 00:33:14.381
Aren't these earrings?

778
00:33:14.382 --> 00:33:15.912
These are earrings.

779
00:33:16.081 --> 00:33:18.681
There is a ring too.

780
00:33:18.682 --> 00:33:21.351
The ring is pretty. I love these.

781
00:33:21.352 --> 00:33:22.851
What is that?

782
00:33:22.852 --> 00:33:24.521
(The jewelry captures Min Chae's heart.)

783
00:33:26.162 --> 00:33:28.422
(Min Chae tries on a tiara.)

784
00:33:29.132 --> 00:33:31.331
It's pretty. It's pretty.

785
00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:33.101
Do you like it?

786
00:33:33.102 --> 00:33:34.132
Yes.

787
00:33:34.402 --> 00:33:35.471
It's pretty.

788
00:33:36.001 --> 00:33:38.602
(Love blooms in Si An's room.)

789
00:33:38.702 --> 00:33:41.501
Will Si An play the piano for Min Chae?

790
00:33:41.842 --> 00:33:46.481
(It's a performance he
prepared for Min Chae.)

791
00:33:50.712 --> 00:33:54.851
(A serenade for Min Chae)

792
00:33:54.852 --> 00:33:58.051
In his mind, he is serenading Min Chae.

793
00:33:58.551 --> 00:34:00.761
Min Chae, can you hear it?

794
00:34:01.862 --> 00:34:03.891
The car is moving.

795
00:34:03.892 --> 00:34:06.301
Min Chae, hold tight.

796
00:34:06.331 --> 00:34:07.661
Okay.

797
00:34:10.032 --> 00:34:11.500
(Si An shows off his driving skills.)

798
00:34:11.501 --> 00:34:13.371
I am going fast.

799
00:34:15.672 --> 00:34:17.640
(Speed up)

800
00:34:17.641 --> 00:34:19.782
Let's eat.

801
00:34:19.942 --> 00:34:23.251
I will cook something delicious.

802
00:34:23.481 --> 00:34:26.152
I will brush your hair, Honey.

803
00:34:28.021 --> 00:34:29.291
Honey.

804
00:34:29.592 --> 00:34:31.390
Min Chae is my honey.

805
00:34:31.391 --> 00:34:32.462
(Embarrassed)

806
00:34:34.722 --> 00:34:37.032
The baby is crying.

807
00:34:37.962 --> 00:34:39.032
Baby.

808
00:34:39.532 --> 00:34:41.700
Baby, don't cry.

809
00:34:41.701 --> 00:34:42.870
(Si An is an affectionate dad.)

810
00:34:42.871 --> 00:34:46.370
- Baby, let's eat.
- Why are you crying?

811
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:47.671
(Si An and Min Chae care for the baby.)

812
00:34:47.672 --> 00:34:49.811
Please carry the baby on your back.

813
00:34:50.541 --> 00:34:51.972
Okay.

814
00:34:52.681 --> 00:34:54.381
I want to hold him like this.

815
00:34:54.382 --> 00:34:55.382
Okay.

816
00:34:55.882 --> 00:34:57.152
Here you go.

817
00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:00.821
I am carrying the baby.

818
00:35:00.822 --> 00:35:02.652
Knock, knock.

819
00:35:03.652 --> 00:35:06.060
Baby, it's time to take your medicine.
Open wide.

820
00:35:06.061 --> 00:35:07.422
(Harmonious and happy days)

821
00:35:07.621 --> 00:35:09.691
- Si An.
- Yes?

822
00:35:09.692 --> 00:35:11.631
- Are you playing well...
- Yes.

823
00:35:11.632 --> 00:35:12.761
With Min Chae?

824
00:35:12.762 --> 00:35:14.661
(Are you playing well with Min Chae?)

825
00:35:15.161 --> 00:35:17.132
(Scary)

826
00:35:18.802 --> 00:35:21.971
Is it more fun than playing with me?

827
00:35:21.972 --> 00:35:23.041
Yes.

828
00:35:24.871 --> 00:35:28.080
(How dare he!)

829
00:35:28.081 --> 00:35:30.382
(She feels betrayed.)

830
00:35:30.612 --> 00:35:32.012
Do you want to play with us?

831
00:35:32.722 --> 00:35:33.850
Do you want to play with us?

832
00:35:33.851 --> 00:35:34.882
Yes.

833
00:35:35.152 --> 00:35:36.291
Min Chae.

834
00:35:36.621 --> 00:35:39.222
Do you want to play doctor?

835
00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:40.761
Who wants to be the doctor?

836
00:35:40.762 --> 00:35:41.821
Me.

837
00:35:41.822 --> 00:35:43.191
- All right.
- Me.

838
00:35:43.192 --> 00:35:44.331
Me.

839
00:35:44.492 --> 00:35:46.600
- I am hurting.
- Thank you.

840
00:35:46.601 --> 00:35:48.430
I am hurting.

841
00:35:48.431 --> 00:35:50.771
I knew this would happen.

842
00:35:52.242 --> 00:35:53.370
Seol A and Soo A,

843
00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:57.011
you should let Si An and Min Chae play...

844
00:35:57.012 --> 00:35:58.672
by themselves.

845
00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:02.382
You played with Min Ha without Si An.

846
00:36:02.652 --> 00:36:04.811
(It pricks at her conscience.)

847
00:36:05.282 --> 00:36:07.552
Hurry up and open the door.

848
00:36:07.851 --> 00:36:09.291
It's me, Si An.

849
00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:12.991
When their friend came over,

850
00:36:12.992 --> 00:36:15.731
Seol A and Soo A played without Si An.

851
00:36:17.291 --> 00:36:19.962
(How could they.)

852
00:36:21.632 --> 00:36:25.172
He felt agony at the tender age of four.

853
00:36:26.902 --> 00:36:28.270
What's wrong, Si An?

854
00:36:28.271 --> 00:36:29.541
(I won't forget this.)

855
00:36:30.942 --> 00:36:34.310
When Min Ha came,

856
00:36:34.311 --> 00:36:35.450
(Stuttering)

857
00:36:35.451 --> 00:36:38.951
Si An bothered him.

858
00:36:39.121 --> 00:36:41.481
- Did Si An bother him?
- Si An gave him a hug.

859
00:36:45.561 --> 00:36:46.922
(Hugging)

860
00:36:47.962 --> 00:36:50.931
(Flustered)

861
00:36:51.632 --> 00:36:54.861
What do you want to be when you grow up?

862
00:36:54.862 --> 00:36:56.600
I want to be a princess.

863
00:36:56.601 --> 00:37:00.941
Do you want to try on a princess' dress?

864
00:37:00.942 --> 00:37:01.971
Yes.

865
00:37:01.972 --> 00:37:03.811
- There are a lot.
- This one.

866
00:37:04.242 --> 00:37:06.040
- Little Mermaid dress?
- No, this one.

867
00:37:06.041 --> 00:37:07.640
- This one?
- Snow White dress.

868
00:37:07.641 --> 00:37:09.081
(They choose dresses excitedly.)

869
00:37:10.112 --> 00:37:13.321
(He goes outside while they change.)

870
00:37:13.322 --> 00:37:15.350
Si An, what is Min Chae doing?

871
00:37:15.351 --> 00:37:19.192
She is putting on a princess' dress.

872
00:37:19.462 --> 00:37:21.491
- A princess' dress?
- Yes.

873
00:37:21.492 --> 00:37:23.890
Si An, how should you react...

874
00:37:23.891 --> 00:37:25.532
when Min Chae comes out...

875
00:37:25.661 --> 00:37:27.761
- in a princess' dress.
- "You look pretty."

876
00:37:27.762 --> 00:37:30.270
Tell her that she looks pretty, okay?

877
00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:31.632
Give her...

878
00:37:32.302 --> 00:37:34.802
a big reaction.

879
00:37:36.072 --> 00:37:38.310
"My goodness, you look pretty."

880
00:37:38.311 --> 00:37:39.810
Go. What should you say?

881
00:37:39.811 --> 00:37:42.481
"My goodness, you look pretty."

882
00:37:42.811 --> 00:37:43.911
Clap.

883
00:37:43.951 --> 00:37:45.381
(Clap to double the effect.)

884
00:37:45.382 --> 00:37:48.180
"You are the best. You look pretty."

885
00:37:48.181 --> 00:37:52.092
Your nose grows if you lie.

886
00:37:52.862 --> 00:37:55.290
Right. Your nose grows if you lie.

887
00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:57.591
You lied.

888
00:37:57.592 --> 00:37:59.402
No, I didn't lie.

889
00:38:00.201 --> 00:38:02.101
(He checks his nose.)

890
00:38:03.072 --> 00:38:04.231
My goodness.

891
00:38:05.072 --> 00:38:06.270
Here she comes.

892
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:08.201
(He becomes extremely excited again.)

893
00:38:10.411 --> 00:38:13.841
They turned into princesses.

894
00:38:13.842 --> 00:38:15.041
(The three princesses enter.)

895
00:38:15.481 --> 00:38:17.382
How will Si An react?

896
00:38:18.981 --> 00:38:22.451
You look pretty.

897
00:38:22.621 --> 00:38:23.922
How pretty!

898
00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:27.362
You look the prettiest.

899
00:38:28.791 --> 00:38:30.831
Si An, who is the prettiest?

900
00:38:31.032 --> 00:38:32.230
Min Chae.

901
00:38:32.231 --> 00:38:33.731
(Was he too honest?)

902
00:38:35.032 --> 00:38:37.802
Min Chae, you take the first place.

903
00:38:37.972 --> 00:38:40.140
Si An, go on a date,

904
00:38:40.141 --> 00:38:41.270
okay?

905
00:38:41.271 --> 00:38:42.641
Go on a date.

906
00:38:43.112 --> 00:38:45.810
Go to the park.

907
00:38:45.811 --> 00:38:49.481
Min Chae and I will be back.

908
00:38:50.911 --> 00:38:52.921
A bus.

909
00:38:52.922 --> 00:38:54.951
A bus.

910
00:38:55.251 --> 00:38:56.651
Let's go on a bus.

911
00:38:56.652 --> 00:38:58.322
Let's go.

912
00:38:59.922 --> 00:39:01.660
It's your first time riding a bus here.

913
00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:04.362
Right? It's your first time.

914
00:39:04.962 --> 00:39:07.231
- Snack.
- Snack.

915
00:39:07.802 --> 00:39:10.371
You want a snack.

916
00:39:11.371 --> 00:39:12.742
Here comes the bus.

917
00:39:13.501 --> 00:39:16.810
Jane, the bus is coming.

918
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:17.972
(Welcome, bus.)

919
00:39:20.742 --> 00:39:23.281
Does she need to pay?

920
00:39:23.282 --> 00:39:24.652
No.

921
00:39:28.181 --> 00:39:31.092
Jane goes on her first date with Dad.

922
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:33.322
It's your first time taking a bus.

923
00:39:35.962 --> 00:39:38.132
(Winking)

924
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:42.632
(She is cute.)

925
00:39:44.371 --> 00:39:47.242
(She acts cute.)

926
00:39:47.701 --> 00:39:50.411
Why are you acting cute?
For whom are you doing it?

927
00:39:51.371 --> 00:39:52.512
Jane.

928
00:39:53.382 --> 00:39:54.782
For whom are you doing it?

929
00:39:55.342 --> 00:39:56.481
Look.

930
00:39:57.411 --> 00:39:59.222
Let me tell you what it says.

931
00:39:59.822 --> 00:40:02.591
If you ride the bus without paying,

932
00:40:02.592 --> 00:40:04.391
you will get a fine of 20 dollars.

933
00:40:04.822 --> 00:40:06.620
The bus fare is one dollar.

934
00:40:06.621 --> 00:40:08.422
You will have to pay 20 times more.

935
00:40:08.891 --> 00:40:11.762
When you are old enough to take a bus,

936
00:40:12.061 --> 00:40:13.862
you should make sure to pay the fare.

937
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:15.100
Okay?

938
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:16.871
(She is too young for this education.)

939
00:40:17.271 --> 00:40:19.041
This is nice.

940
00:40:21.402 --> 00:40:24.112
(They get off the bus.)

941
00:40:24.212 --> 00:40:26.441
Here you go.

942
00:40:26.442 --> 00:40:27.641
Ta-da.

943
00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:29.351
All right.

944
00:40:29.712 --> 00:40:30.910
Bye.

945
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:32.350
(Bye, bus.)

946
00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:34.021
We will take a tram now.

947
00:40:35.751 --> 00:40:37.592
Here comes the tram.

948
00:40:39.262 --> 00:40:41.192
Let's take it.

949
00:40:41.422 --> 00:40:43.032
Here comes the tram.

950
00:40:43.891 --> 00:40:46.401
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

951
00:40:46.402 --> 00:40:47.660
Let's go.

952
00:40:47.661 --> 00:40:49.731
(What?)

953
00:40:50.431 --> 00:40:51.631
Let's go.

954
00:40:51.632 --> 00:40:54.672
(Is he jaywalking?)

955
00:40:56.742 --> 00:40:59.140
Since trams run in the middle of the road,

956
00:40:59.141 --> 00:41:00.580
the cars stop...

957
00:41:00.581 --> 00:41:02.651
for the safety of the passengers.

958
00:41:02.652 --> 00:41:06.121
(People stand on the road
to get on the tram.)

959
00:41:06.581 --> 00:41:10.120
(He passes two cabins...)

960
00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:12.862
(and takes a seat.)

961
00:41:13.322 --> 00:41:14.992
Jane, it's your first time taking a tram.

962
00:41:17.661 --> 00:41:20.201
Tell Mom later that you took a tram.

963
00:41:20.731 --> 00:41:22.731
(I am excited.)

964
00:41:24.101 --> 00:41:26.701
Give one to me.

965
00:41:27.802 --> 00:41:29.742
(Loving)

966
00:41:36.251 --> 00:41:40.052
(They are a loving dad and daughter.)

967
00:41:40.981 --> 00:41:41.981
Here.

968
00:41:43.152 --> 00:41:44.821
(They follow the tram rail...)

969
00:41:44.822 --> 00:41:46.722
By tram,

970
00:41:46.862 --> 00:41:48.191
(to navigate Moscow.)

971
00:41:48.192 --> 00:41:50.692
they pass through the center of the city...

972
00:41:53.161 --> 00:41:56.401
to arrive at the park the locals frequent.

973
00:41:56.402 --> 00:42:00.371
(They arrive at Severnoye Tushino Park.)

974
00:42:03.172 --> 00:42:05.681
What is that? There is a swing.

975
00:42:06.581 --> 00:42:07.842
- Hello.
- Hello.

976
00:42:08.041 --> 00:42:09.512
Say, "Hello."

977
00:42:09.581 --> 00:42:10.811
What's your name?

978
00:42:11.081 --> 00:42:12.251
Jane.

979
00:42:13.782 --> 00:42:15.751
- Jane.
- Jane.

980
00:42:15.851 --> 00:42:17.621
What a pretty girl...

981
00:42:17.922 --> 00:42:19.791
with a pretty name!

982
00:42:19.992 --> 00:42:21.222
How old are they?

983
00:42:22.891 --> 00:42:25.802
(2 years and 6 months,
2 years and 10 months)

984
00:42:28.132 --> 00:42:31.001
She is 1 year and 7 months old.

985
00:42:31.802 --> 00:42:33.541
What are you filming?

986
00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:38.341
They came from Korea...

987
00:42:38.342 --> 00:42:41.041
- to film a show.
- They came from Korea.

988
00:42:41.512 --> 00:42:43.180
I look after the child without my wife.

989
00:42:43.181 --> 00:42:44.882
(I look after the child without my wife.)

990
00:42:44.911 --> 00:42:46.581
That's great.

991
00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:50.021
(The father isn't impressed.)

992
00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:52.421
What do you want to do?

993
00:42:52.422 --> 00:42:53.620
(Let's go that way.)

994
00:42:53.621 --> 00:42:54.822
Bye.

995
00:42:55.692 --> 00:42:56.791
What?

996
00:42:57.931 --> 00:42:59.862
I won't hold your hand.
Come down the slide.

997
00:43:02.072 --> 00:43:03.531
Let's go.

998
00:43:03.532 --> 00:43:05.071
(Should I go or not?)

999
00:43:05.072 --> 00:43:06.072
Jane.

1000
00:43:07.942 --> 00:43:10.771
(Sliding)

1001
00:43:14.382 --> 00:43:15.980
(My head hurts.)

1002
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:17.451
Did you bump your head?

1003
00:43:18.552 --> 00:43:20.281
(Dad, come here.)

1004
00:43:20.282 --> 00:43:21.822
Play, Jane.

1005
00:43:23.851 --> 00:43:25.251
What are the girls doing?

1006
00:43:25.822 --> 00:43:27.261
They are shoveling sand.

1007
00:43:27.262 --> 00:43:28.982
(The little fairies are playing with sand.)

1008
00:43:29.862 --> 00:43:31.261
Do you want to try it?

1009
00:43:31.262 --> 00:43:33.131
(I want to join them.)

1010
00:43:33.132 --> 00:43:35.001
Go in, Jane.

1011
00:43:35.501 --> 00:43:37.472
Try it. There you go.

1012
00:43:38.402 --> 00:43:40.201
Go ahead and play.

1013
00:43:40.742 --> 00:43:42.770
(Hesitant)

1014
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:43.811
There you go.

1015
00:43:44.472 --> 00:43:45.781
(May I sit with you?)

1016
00:43:45.782 --> 00:43:47.681
Play together, Jane.

1017
00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:49.181
(Hi.)

1018
00:43:49.681 --> 00:43:51.181
There you go.

1019
00:43:51.911 --> 00:43:53.021
There you go.

1020
00:43:53.121 --> 00:43:55.021
(She gives Jane a scoop of sand.)

1021
00:43:56.922 --> 00:43:59.161
(It lands on Jane's leg.)

1022
00:43:59.862 --> 00:44:02.291
(My goodness.)

1023
00:44:04.032 --> 00:44:05.661
- Do you want to go?
- It hurts.

1024
00:44:05.931 --> 00:44:06.962
Does it hurt?

1025
00:44:07.661 --> 00:44:10.731
(He shakes her up and down.)

1026
00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:14.242
It's okay. You can play with sand.

1027
00:44:14.641 --> 00:44:18.140
(Blow on my leg.)

1028
00:44:18.141 --> 00:44:19.212
Does it sting?

1029
00:44:19.612 --> 00:44:21.640
(He understands what Jane says.)

1030
00:44:21.641 --> 00:44:24.480
There you go. Let's go that way.

1031
00:44:24.481 --> 00:44:27.451
- Shoes.
- Let's put your shoes on.

1032
00:44:28.722 --> 00:44:30.722
(He feels bad.)

1033
00:44:30.751 --> 00:44:32.791
Say, "Bye."

1034
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:34.560
Let's go.

1035
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:35.992
(Saddened)

1036
00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:38.931
Be careful. Go slowly.

1037
00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:40.862
There you go.

1038
00:44:41.532 --> 00:44:42.572
That's how you do it.

1039
00:44:42.871 --> 00:44:44.302
There you go.

1040
00:44:44.672 --> 00:44:46.442
Go slowly, Jane.

1041
00:44:47.242 --> 00:44:50.271
(The boy from earlier approaches them.)

1042
00:44:51.442 --> 00:44:52.941
(He is excited.)

1043
00:44:52.942 --> 00:44:55.382
Go slowly. Watch where you step.

1044
00:44:55.712 --> 00:44:57.352
(He walks on his own with his bare feet.)

1045
00:44:57.882 --> 00:44:59.181
There you go.

1046
00:44:59.552 --> 00:45:01.581
Jane, shall we feed the ducks?

1047
00:45:02.451 --> 00:45:03.520
Here you go.

1048
00:45:03.521 --> 00:45:06.291
(They feed the ducks together.)

1049
00:45:07.862 --> 00:45:09.422
Jane, do you want to try throwing food?

1050
00:45:11.391 --> 00:45:13.462
No, don't eat it.

1051
00:45:14.201 --> 00:45:16.371
(It's my food.)

1052
00:45:18.032 --> 00:45:19.312
There are a lot of ducks, right?

1053
00:45:20.141 --> 00:45:22.271
They are playing in water.

1054
00:45:22.342 --> 00:45:23.672
Shall we go that way?

1055
00:45:24.641 --> 00:45:27.180
At the bank of Moscow River,

1056
00:45:27.181 --> 00:45:29.511
everyone is getting a sun tan.

1057
00:45:29.512 --> 00:45:30.980
(People are tanning on the small beach.)

1058
00:45:30.981 --> 00:45:33.620
The Muscovites enjoy the sun...

1059
00:45:33.621 --> 00:45:35.350
in a free-spirited way.

1060
00:45:35.351 --> 00:45:37.552
(The summer is short in Russia.)

1061
00:45:37.851 --> 00:45:40.722
The beach in the city provides relaxation.

1062
00:45:40.862 --> 00:45:43.492
Are Jane and Victor ready to have fun?

1063
00:45:45.802 --> 00:45:47.161
Jane, I need to put air...

1064
00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:51.802
I need to put air in it.

1065
00:45:52.172 --> 00:45:53.341
It won't go in.

1066
00:45:53.342 --> 00:45:56.072
(She staggers since she is on a hill.)

1067
00:45:58.842 --> 00:45:59.941
(It begins to take shape.)

1068
00:45:59.942 --> 00:46:01.140
I need to put air in it.

1069
00:46:01.141 --> 00:46:02.451
(It begins to take shape.)

1070
00:46:04.811 --> 00:46:07.052
(The air sofa is ready.)

1071
00:46:07.822 --> 00:46:10.391
(A woman approaches him.)

1072
00:46:11.552 --> 00:46:13.462
(She asks for a picture.)

1073
00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:18.532
She is a fan who recognized Victor.

1074
00:46:21.231 --> 00:46:24.431
(He is a superstar in Russia.)

1075
00:46:26.271 --> 00:46:29.342
(My dad is popular.)

1076
00:46:31.342 --> 00:46:32.382
Thank you.

1077
00:46:32.612 --> 00:46:34.181
Do you want to sit here?

1078
00:46:36.411 --> 00:46:37.552
Look at this.

1079
00:46:39.021 --> 00:46:42.021
(She sinks into an air sofa.)

1080
00:46:43.192 --> 00:46:45.051
(It's soft.)

1081
00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:46.092
Do you like it?

1082
00:46:46.592 --> 00:46:48.891
I brought swimsuits.

1083
00:46:49.061 --> 00:46:50.430
This one is for you.

1084
00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:53.462
You need to put it on.

1085
00:46:53.501 --> 00:46:55.231
You need to put it on.

1086
00:46:56.032 --> 00:46:59.640
(He attempts to help her wear a swimsuit.)

1087
00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:02.641
This one goes first. There you go.

1088
00:47:04.572 --> 00:47:05.742
My goodness.

1089
00:47:06.311 --> 00:47:09.052
(Little and cute)

1090
00:47:09.782 --> 00:47:11.080
You look cute!

1091
00:47:11.081 --> 00:47:12.151
(He is satisfied.)

1092
00:47:12.152 --> 00:47:13.282
Do you like it?

1093
00:47:13.382 --> 00:47:15.790
(How do I look?)

1094
00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:17.421
Put this swim cap on.

1095
00:47:17.422 --> 00:47:22.132
(The swim cap makes her 100 times cuter.)

1096
00:47:22.462 --> 00:47:23.632
With the swim cap,

1097
00:47:24.092 --> 00:47:25.661
your hair is invisible.

1098
00:47:28.902 --> 00:47:30.472
Do you have scissors?

1099
00:47:31.001 --> 00:47:32.572
Scissors.

1100
00:47:32.641 --> 00:47:35.442
I am going to put a hole in the swim cap.

1101
00:47:38.041 --> 00:47:39.842
I will put a hole in the swim cap.

1102
00:47:40.242 --> 00:47:42.152
- Okay.
- Wait a minute.

1103
00:47:43.981 --> 00:47:46.951
You aren't cutting hair, are you?

1104
00:47:49.152 --> 00:47:50.221
(He tries hard to make
her look like a girl.)

1105
00:47:50.222 --> 00:47:51.422
There you go.

1106
00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:53.592
- Thank goodness.
- One in the back, too.

1107
00:47:54.092 --> 00:47:55.762
She looks cute.

1108
00:48:00.262 --> 00:48:01.802
It's a success.

1109
00:48:02.771 --> 00:48:05.370
(Do I look like a girl now?)

1110
00:48:05.371 --> 00:48:08.472
Jane, I will go and change.

1111
00:48:08.701 --> 00:48:10.212
(Nodding)

1112
00:48:11.271 --> 00:48:12.712
Please watch Jane for a second.

1113
00:48:13.041 --> 00:48:14.742
I will go and change.

1114
00:48:16.112 --> 00:48:19.121
(Don't worry about me.)

1115
00:48:19.882 --> 00:48:21.181
Jane.

1116
00:48:22.222 --> 00:48:23.592
Jane.

1117
00:48:29.431 --> 00:48:32.902
(He has six pack abs.)

1118
00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:38.971
(A hard training gave him...)

1119
00:48:38.972 --> 00:48:41.172
(defined abs.)

1120
00:48:42.942 --> 00:48:44.342
Did you enjoy your food?

1121
00:48:45.342 --> 00:48:46.742
I changed.

1122
00:48:47.242 --> 00:48:50.851
(He is ready to get a sun tan.)

1123
00:48:53.322 --> 00:48:55.152
(Thank you.)

1124
00:48:56.451 --> 00:48:58.291
Let's eat.

1125
00:49:00.092 --> 00:49:01.161
Try it.

1126
00:49:01.992 --> 00:49:03.161
There you go.

1127
00:49:03.561 --> 00:49:04.831
It's a rice ball.

1128
00:49:05.132 --> 00:49:06.212
(She puts it in her mouth.)

1129
00:49:07.132 --> 00:49:08.972
You should take smaller bites.

1130
00:49:10.331 --> 00:49:12.841
(Food tastes better when they are outside.)

1131
00:49:12.842 --> 00:49:14.302
Jane, lie back like me.

1132
00:49:14.802 --> 00:49:16.112
It's comfortable.

1133
00:49:16.311 --> 00:49:17.311
My goodness.

1134
00:49:18.172 --> 00:49:19.712
Everyone is lying back.

1135
00:49:19.842 --> 00:49:21.480
This is how you relax.

1136
00:49:21.481 --> 00:49:23.181
(They feel drowsy after eating.)

1137
00:49:23.782 --> 00:49:27.481
Jane and her dad's first date is a success.

1138
00:49:28.521 --> 00:49:31.922
The sun sets and the evening comes.

1139
00:49:32.422 --> 00:49:35.731
Everyone is going home with a tired body.

1140
00:49:36.132 --> 00:49:38.931
However, some windows remain bright.

1141
00:49:39.632 --> 00:49:42.032
There is a man in an empty office.

1142
00:49:42.831 --> 00:49:46.600
(Ji Yong is working late.)

1143
00:49:46.601 --> 00:49:49.712
Dad, why do you have so much work?

1144
00:49:50.012 --> 00:49:53.012
(Dad, why do you have so much work?)

1145
00:49:53.382 --> 00:49:56.481
Since my wife and I work,

1146
00:49:56.681 --> 00:49:59.520
this happens from time to time.

1147
00:49:59.521 --> 00:50:02.620
I couldn't finish work on time.

1148
00:50:02.621 --> 00:50:05.790
Because my wife has an appointment,

1149
00:50:05.791 --> 00:50:07.822
she couldn't look after Seung Jae.

1150
00:50:07.962 --> 00:50:11.262
That's why I brought him
to the company to wait.

1151
00:50:12.362 --> 00:50:14.160
- Seung Jae.
- Yes?

1152
00:50:14.161 --> 00:50:16.501
I am sorry that this is taking long.

1153
00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:18.601
- Let's go, Dad.
- Let's go.

1154
00:50:18.842 --> 00:50:20.841
- Let's go.
- I will finish it soon.

1155
00:50:20.842 --> 00:50:22.810
(He cheers for his dad.)

1156
00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:27.882
(What should I play with?)

1157
00:50:30.512 --> 00:50:32.621
Why is there so much work?

1158
00:50:34.382 --> 00:50:36.492
I got a call.

1159
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:39.362
Who is this?

1160
00:50:39.862 --> 00:50:42.291
Is your sister sick?

1161
00:50:42.731 --> 00:50:45.901
I will be there shortly.

1162
00:50:45.902 --> 00:50:46.931
(He responds right away.)

1163
00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:50.430
(He keeps receiving calls.)

1164
00:50:50.431 --> 00:50:51.501
What is it?

1165
00:50:52.742 --> 00:50:56.212
Is Mr. Elephant locked in a park?

1166
00:50:56.371 --> 00:50:59.212
Okay, I will be there shortly.

1167
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:02.281
(When is he leaving?)

1168
00:51:02.282 --> 00:51:03.680
(Surprised)

1169
00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:06.351
Does Mr. Giraffe have a sore throat?

1170
00:51:06.382 --> 00:51:09.451
Okay, I will be there shortly.

1171
00:51:09.822 --> 00:51:11.821
(He finally gets up to go.)

1172
00:51:11.822 --> 00:51:12.822
Let's go.

1173
00:51:14.262 --> 00:51:17.492
Mr. Giraffe. Mr. Giraffe.

1174
00:51:17.532 --> 00:51:21.061
Mr. Giraffe. Mr. Giraffe.

1175
00:51:23.431 --> 00:51:24.601
My goodness.

1176
00:51:26.641 --> 00:51:29.611
(He returns to work.)

1177
00:51:29.612 --> 00:51:31.512
I am working.

1178
00:51:32.041 --> 00:51:34.311
(He is like an employee
who always works late.)

1179
00:51:34.382 --> 00:51:37.152
Why isn't the computer turned on?

1180
00:51:39.451 --> 00:51:40.521
What is it?

1181
00:51:40.782 --> 00:51:44.751
Will the computer turn on
if I press this button?

1182
00:51:44.951 --> 00:51:46.021
Okay.

1183
00:51:48.262 --> 00:51:50.762
I pressed it. Please turn on.

1184
00:51:51.661 --> 00:51:53.230
Is it working? No, it's not.

1185
00:51:53.231 --> 00:51:54.931
I can't start the computer.

1186
00:51:56.101 --> 00:51:58.972
Mr. Ko Ji Yong!

1187
00:51:59.641 --> 00:52:00.741
Mr. Ko Ji Yong!

1188
00:52:00.742 --> 00:52:02.441
(He's flustered.)

1189
00:52:02.442 --> 00:52:03.671
Mr. Ko Ji Yong!

1190
00:52:03.672 --> 00:52:05.040
(The intern is summoning the director.)

1191
00:52:05.041 --> 00:52:06.712
What are you doing, Seung Jae?

1192
00:52:06.842 --> 00:52:07.981
I'm working.

1193
00:52:08.081 --> 00:52:09.781
Come here. I'll show you something fun.

1194
00:52:09.782 --> 00:52:11.480
- What is it?
- Look.

1195
00:52:11.481 --> 00:52:12.481
Yes.

1196
00:52:13.552 --> 00:52:14.621
What is it?

1197
00:52:15.692 --> 00:52:17.951
- Let's see.
- Okay. Let's see.

1198
00:52:18.692 --> 00:52:19.692
- Keep watching.
- Let's see.

1199
00:52:19.692 --> 00:52:20.852
- Keep watching.
- Let's see.

1200
00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:23.790
(He has made a copy.)

1201
00:52:23.791 --> 00:52:24.890
What is this?

1202
00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:27.031
- It's exactly like this.
- It's identical, right?

1203
00:52:27.032 --> 00:52:28.430
(He's working and taking care of his son.)

1204
00:52:28.431 --> 00:52:29.930
This is how I work.

1205
00:52:29.931 --> 00:52:31.601
- Did you get it?
- It's running.

1206
00:52:33.572 --> 00:52:34.942
I want to try too.

1207
00:52:36.012 --> 00:52:37.141
Wait.

1208
00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:39.581
I can do this.

1209
00:52:43.251 --> 00:52:45.621
(This smart guy can copy
his dad right away.)

1210
00:52:46.422 --> 00:52:47.551
(Feeling excited)

1211
00:52:47.552 --> 00:52:48.851
Come on out.

1212
00:52:51.291 --> 00:52:53.191
(What did Seung Jae copy?)

1213
00:52:53.192 --> 00:52:54.961
- Dad!
- Yes?

1214
00:52:54.962 --> 00:52:58.262
Look at this! There's a deer on it!

1215
00:52:58.362 --> 00:53:00.600
- What is that?
- It looks like a deer.

1216
00:53:00.601 --> 00:53:01.730
How did you do this, Seung Jae?

1217
00:53:01.731 --> 00:53:04.930
I put the deer on it. I put it here.

1218
00:53:04.931 --> 00:53:06.742
The deer came out from here!

1219
00:53:07.001 --> 00:53:09.511
You put the deer between
here and pressed it?

1220
00:53:09.512 --> 00:53:12.511
Yes. Look. Let me try this.

1221
00:53:12.512 --> 00:53:14.112
(He shows off in front of the director.)

1222
00:53:14.311 --> 00:53:15.951
There are two now.

1223
00:53:16.451 --> 00:53:17.910
All right. I should put this down.

1224
00:53:17.911 --> 00:53:18.951
(He's not bad.)

1225
00:53:21.021 --> 00:53:22.492
Look at this.

1226
00:53:23.222 --> 00:53:24.351
Hold on.

1227
00:53:25.021 --> 00:53:27.021
- There are 2 deer.
- There are 1 and a half.

1228
00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:29.592
- What is this?
- It's one and a half.

1229
00:53:30.032 --> 00:53:32.330
- It covers this much.
- No, no.

1230
00:53:32.331 --> 00:53:34.301
Seung Jae, if you put them in the center,

1231
00:53:34.302 --> 00:53:35.971
deer on this side won't be in the paper.

1232
00:53:35.972 --> 00:53:38.230
Toward this side? I'll put three this time.

1233
00:53:38.231 --> 00:53:39.358
(He fixes his mistake.)

1234
00:53:40.641 --> 00:53:41.771
Let's try this.

1235
00:53:44.771 --> 00:53:49.251
It's coming out. Here it comes.

1236
00:53:50.382 --> 00:53:51.611
(Giggling)

1237
00:53:51.612 --> 00:53:52.822
There are three!

1238
00:53:53.981 --> 00:53:55.891
(He successfully prints three deer.)

1239
00:53:57.552 --> 00:53:58.922
This is so exciting!

1240
00:54:00.621 --> 00:54:03.992
(It's great to work with Dad.)

1241
00:54:04.431 --> 00:54:05.731
Shall we print your hand?

1242
00:54:06.862 --> 00:54:08.700
- This hand, please.
- This hand?

1243
00:54:08.701 --> 00:54:11.071
(He wants to play with Seung Jae more.)

1244
00:54:11.072 --> 00:54:13.501
- Here it comes.
- Let's check the paper.

1245
00:54:14.271 --> 00:54:16.541
- There's my hand on this!
- Your hand is on it.

1246
00:54:17.742 --> 00:54:20.041
("Seung Jae Was Here")

1247
00:54:20.641 --> 00:54:22.681
I will finish quickly and
play with you, Seung Jae.

1248
00:54:23.552 --> 00:54:25.421
(He follows his dad.)

1249
00:54:25.422 --> 00:54:26.722
- Dad.
- Yes?

1250
00:54:27.751 --> 00:54:30.421
(Seung Jae wants to play with him more.)

1251
00:54:30.422 --> 00:54:33.261
Dad, make me small pieces of paper, please.

1252
00:54:33.262 --> 00:54:34.660
Do you want to play gun fight?

1253
00:54:34.661 --> 00:54:37.391
I'm going to do it with you.

1254
00:54:37.692 --> 00:54:41.262
This often happens to
those working parents.

1255
00:54:42.902 --> 00:54:44.405
- Seung Jae.
- Yes?

1256
00:54:44.406 --> 00:54:46.917
This is just like money.

1257
00:54:46.942 --> 00:54:49.111
- Can you see the stamps?
- Yes.

1258
00:54:49.112 --> 00:54:50.370
This is just like money.

1259
00:54:50.371 --> 00:54:52.081
Go to the coffee shop on the first floor.

1260
00:54:52.512 --> 00:54:54.281
Get Daddy iced Americano.

1261
00:54:54.282 --> 00:54:56.850
- Iced coffee. Americano.
- Yes.

1262
00:54:56.851 --> 00:54:58.311
Please get me iced Americano.

1263
00:54:59.251 --> 00:55:02.391
Then I want iced apple juice!

1264
00:55:02.621 --> 00:55:04.691
- Iced apple juice?
- Yes.

1265
00:55:04.692 --> 00:55:08.091
With this, buy yourself iced apple juice.

1266
00:55:08.092 --> 00:55:10.330
With this, please bring me iced Americano.

1267
00:55:10.331 --> 00:55:11.390
- Yes.
- Got it?

1268
00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:13.532
Go to the first floor and turn right.

1269
00:55:13.701 --> 00:55:15.471
Get out of the elevator, and turn right.

1270
00:55:15.472 --> 00:55:16.730
- To the right.
- To the right.

1271
00:55:16.731 --> 00:55:19.200
- This is the 7th floor.
- Let's go.

1272
00:55:19.201 --> 00:55:20.941
Press number 7 when you come back.

1273
00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:22.742
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon.

1274
00:55:24.242 --> 00:55:26.612
(He's having fun looking at his face.)

1275
00:55:26.842 --> 00:55:28.012
Ta-da!

1276
00:55:28.751 --> 00:55:31.552
I'm here for the coffee!

1277
00:55:31.811 --> 00:55:35.152
(He ventures out to buy coffee.)

1278
00:55:38.351 --> 00:55:40.862
(He goes straight without any hesitation.)

1279
00:55:41.262 --> 00:55:43.291
(He said I have to turn right.)

1280
00:55:44.992 --> 00:55:47.230
(He turns right.)

1281
00:55:47.231 --> 00:55:51.902
Let's go. Let's get going.

1282
00:55:53.172 --> 00:55:54.802
(Struggling to open the door)

1283
00:55:57.842 --> 00:55:59.181
Here you go!

1284
00:55:59.411 --> 00:56:00.841
What would you like?

1285
00:56:00.842 --> 00:56:04.751
I'd like iced coffee and iced apple juice.

1286
00:56:04.851 --> 00:56:07.950
We don't have apple juice.
How about orange juice?

1287
00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:10.521
Then please give me orange juice.

1288
00:56:11.092 --> 00:56:13.592
I'll give you this. Please
wait for your drinks.

1289
00:56:15.661 --> 00:56:18.032
(What is this?)

1290
00:56:18.902 --> 00:56:20.560
Why did you give this to me?

1291
00:56:20.561 --> 00:56:24.930
When it vibrates, I will
give you coffee and juice.

1292
00:56:24.931 --> 00:56:26.242
Is this like a cell phone?

1293
00:56:26.701 --> 00:56:27.972
This is like a buzzer.

1294
00:56:28.541 --> 00:56:29.571
Let's see.

1295
00:56:29.572 --> 00:56:30.910
(He's fascinated by the buzzer.)

1296
00:56:30.911 --> 00:56:32.212
I'm going to watch this.

1297
00:56:34.342 --> 00:56:35.712
(What?)

1298
00:56:36.052 --> 00:56:37.911
Sir, what are you drinking?

1299
00:56:38.822 --> 00:56:40.302
I'm not that old. We're like friends.

1300
00:56:40.922 --> 00:56:42.350
- Say, "Hey".
- Hey.

1301
00:56:42.351 --> 00:56:43.521
Let's shake hands.

1302
00:56:44.222 --> 00:56:46.521
Let's shake hands. It's nice to meet you.

1303
00:56:46.962 --> 00:56:48.961
(You don't look like my peers.)

1304
00:56:48.962 --> 00:56:50.730
- You're not my friend.
- Yes, I am.

1305
00:56:50.731 --> 00:56:52.901
- You're not my friend.
- Yes, I am.

1306
00:56:52.902 --> 00:56:54.801
(They're arguing.)

1307
00:56:54.802 --> 00:56:56.601
- You're not my friend.
- Yes, I am.

1308
00:56:56.831 --> 00:56:59.101
You're an adult. You're tall.

1309
00:56:59.672 --> 00:57:01.140
You're tall.

1310
00:57:01.141 --> 00:57:03.540
Even if I'm tall, I'm still your friend.

1311
00:57:03.541 --> 00:57:04.811
(No, you're not.)

1312
00:57:05.481 --> 00:57:06.611
(They're in conflict.)

1313
00:57:06.612 --> 00:57:09.781
Your drinks are ready, so please...

1314
00:57:09.782 --> 00:57:11.580
- come to the counter.
- Here you go.

1315
00:57:11.581 --> 00:57:13.451
Please open the juice bottle for me.

1316
00:57:14.922 --> 00:57:16.242
- Thank you.
- Here's the coffee.

1317
00:57:17.152 --> 00:57:19.291
(He takes a sip of the
juice after the debate.)

1318
00:57:21.121 --> 00:57:22.331
Bye.

1319
00:57:22.561 --> 00:57:24.431
Goodbye.

1320
00:57:28.201 --> 00:57:30.672
I'm going to see my dad.

1321
00:57:33.001 --> 00:57:34.541
7th floor.
- 7th floor.

1322
00:57:34.771 --> 00:57:36.641
It's going up.

1323
00:57:37.012 --> 00:57:39.080
It's moving up.

1324
00:57:39.081 --> 00:57:40.140
This is the seventh floor.

1325
00:57:40.141 --> 00:57:43.782
Dad, what are you doing?

1326
00:57:44.751 --> 00:57:46.250
(He starts playing the
hide and seek alone.)

1327
00:57:46.251 --> 00:57:48.721
Dad is right there.

1328
00:57:48.722 --> 00:57:50.552
What is Dad doing?

1329
00:57:51.391 --> 00:57:53.092
(He hasn't noticed Seung Jae at all.)

1330
00:57:53.592 --> 00:57:55.931
I brought you the iced coffee.

1331
00:57:57.661 --> 00:57:59.962
I brought you the iced coffee.

1332
00:58:00.201 --> 00:58:01.701
Good job.

1333
00:58:02.001 --> 00:58:03.771
Goodness, you went downstairs for this?

1334
00:58:04.371 --> 00:58:05.601
- Did you?
- Yes.

1335
00:58:06.371 --> 00:58:08.172
I didn't drink yours, Dad.

1336
00:58:10.442 --> 00:58:12.212
Dad, drink up.

1337
00:58:12.712 --> 00:58:14.081
Thank you for the coffee.

1338
00:58:14.712 --> 00:58:16.882
Dad, are you done with your computer?

1339
00:58:17.681 --> 00:58:19.181
No, I am not.

1340
00:58:20.181 --> 00:58:21.921
(You do have a lot of work to do.)

1341
00:58:21.922 --> 00:58:23.991
- Hey, are you hungry?
- Yes.

1342
00:58:23.992 --> 00:58:25.561
Do you want to eat jjajangmyeon?

1343
00:58:25.922 --> 00:58:28.491
Hello, this is the seventh floor.

1344
00:58:28.492 --> 00:58:30.191
I'd like a bowl of jjajangmyeon.

1345
00:58:30.192 --> 00:58:32.762
I'll use the coupon for the
small sized tangsuyuk.

1346
00:58:33.231 --> 00:58:35.001
I spend a lot of time at work.

1347
00:58:35.231 --> 00:58:37.730
Before I realize it, I
had a lot of coupons.

1348
00:58:37.731 --> 00:58:40.870
It's fun collecting coupons.

1349
00:58:40.871 --> 00:58:43.041
I used the coupons for both of them.

1350
00:58:43.742 --> 00:58:46.112
Here's the car.

1351
00:58:46.512 --> 00:58:48.081
The food is here. Sit.

1352
00:58:48.541 --> 00:58:49.612
- Hello.
- It's here.

1353
00:58:49.782 --> 00:58:52.052
- Hi.
- Hello.

1354
00:58:53.052 --> 00:58:55.890
- This is jjajangmyeon.
- It's jjajangmyeon.

1355
00:58:55.891 --> 00:58:57.521
It's jjajangmyeon.

1356
00:58:59.422 --> 00:59:00.491
(Glancing)

1357
00:59:00.492 --> 00:59:02.862
Mister, why are you wearing a hat?

1358
00:59:03.561 --> 00:59:06.430
Why are you wearing the hat on your head?

1359
00:59:06.431 --> 00:59:08.870
He rides the motorcycle. It's dangerous.

1360
00:59:08.871 --> 00:59:10.501
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1361
00:59:10.831 --> 00:59:12.972
- Bye.
- Bye.

1362
00:59:14.601 --> 00:59:17.112
- Let's eat.
- I want jjajangmyeon.

1363
00:59:19.382 --> 00:59:21.540
(Late night food after
work is the tastiest.)

1364
00:59:21.541 --> 00:59:23.481
Dad, open your mouth too.

1365
00:59:25.152 --> 00:59:27.620
(He takes care of his dad who worked hard.)

1366
00:59:27.621 --> 00:59:29.261
Hold it first. Feed me one of them first.

1367
00:59:29.692 --> 00:59:32.021
(Dad, eat a lot.)

1368
00:59:32.422 --> 00:59:35.791
I'll work hard, and buy
you good food again.

1369
00:59:35.962 --> 00:59:39.262
I'm sure Seung Jae is just
happy to be with you.

1370
00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:43.032
Meanwhile, Si An left for his date.

1371
00:59:43.831 --> 00:59:46.601
- Be careful, Min Chae.
- Okay.

1372
00:59:48.402 --> 00:59:50.271
Isn't it pretty here?

1373
00:59:51.172 --> 00:59:53.040
(The birds are singing beautifully.)

1374
00:59:53.041 --> 00:59:54.311
I see birds!

1375
00:59:56.382 --> 00:59:58.112
(He can't help but hum.)

1376
01:00:00.121 --> 01:00:02.351
There are flowers here.

1377
01:00:03.121 --> 01:00:04.620
What do girls like?

1378
01:00:04.621 --> 01:00:07.790
(His dad taught him to
give flowers to girls.)

1379
01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:08.861
You should give flowers.

1380
01:00:08.862 --> 01:00:10.931
(I see.)

1381
01:00:11.231 --> 01:00:13.101
- Aren't flowers pretty?
- Yes.

1382
01:00:13.462 --> 01:00:15.631
They are as pretty as you.

1383
01:00:15.632 --> 01:00:18.031
(He's the sweetest.)

1384
01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:22.041
This is the foxtail.

1385
01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:25.811
(He plucks a foxtail.)

1386
01:00:27.712 --> 01:00:29.051
Do it on my arm.

1387
01:00:29.052 --> 01:00:30.282
(He tickles Min Chae.)

1388
01:00:30.411 --> 01:00:32.180
Shall I pluck it this time?

1389
01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:33.851
Okay. How though?

1390
01:00:35.322 --> 01:00:37.152
That's too far.

1391
01:00:38.521 --> 01:00:40.891
Shall I pluck it for you?

1392
01:00:44.532 --> 01:00:48.061
(He tries his best with his short arm.)

1393
01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:51.930
(Min Chae, I happen to
get this on the way.)

1394
01:00:51.931 --> 01:00:53.072
Keep it.

1395
01:00:53.972 --> 01:00:55.201
Thank you.

1396
01:00:57.012 --> 01:00:59.180
(This time, she tickles Si An.)

1397
01:00:59.181 --> 01:01:02.811
(They're a cute couple in love.)

1398
01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:09.822
(Si An and Min Chae are
having a great time.)

1399
01:01:12.922 --> 01:01:15.631
(Si An is taking Min Chae somewhere.)

1400
01:01:15.632 --> 01:01:18.132
I'll sit right here.

1401
01:01:19.262 --> 01:01:20.802
Hold tight.

1402
01:01:22.132 --> 01:01:24.402
(Trying to move)

1403
01:01:25.132 --> 01:01:27.802
(But the see-saw doesn't even budge.)

1404
01:01:28.541 --> 01:01:30.641
Why isn't it moving?

1405
01:01:32.512 --> 01:01:35.512
(She moves the see-saw with some energy.)

1406
01:01:35.712 --> 01:01:37.981
Min Chae, you're good.

1407
01:01:38.081 --> 01:01:40.081
(Amazed)

1408
01:01:41.251 --> 01:01:43.651
Min Chae, this is fun.

1409
01:01:43.652 --> 01:01:45.192
(The see-saw makes big movements.)

1410
01:01:45.722 --> 01:01:46.961
Isn't it fun?

1411
01:01:46.962 --> 01:01:48.621
It's fun!

1412
01:01:50.592 --> 01:01:54.101
(The see-saw is so thrilling.)

1413
01:01:57.371 --> 01:01:59.871
The see-saw ride is getting more intense.

1414
01:02:00.802 --> 01:02:02.310
Wait.

1415
01:02:02.311 --> 01:02:03.371
What is it?

1416
01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:06.141
Min Chae, I'm scared.

1417
01:02:06.382 --> 01:02:08.242
Were you scared?

1418
01:02:08.681 --> 01:02:09.950
Are you okay?

1419
01:02:09.951 --> 01:02:11.251
(I wanted to look cool.)

1420
01:02:11.351 --> 01:02:13.922
I was a little scared.

1421
01:02:14.422 --> 01:02:17.691
While Si An and Min Chae
are having a sweet time,

1422
01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:18.821
what are his sisters doing?

1423
01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:21.221
(Seol A looks displeased.)

1424
01:02:21.222 --> 01:02:22.230
What?

1425
01:02:22.231 --> 01:02:26.061
I think that girl stole Si An.

1426
01:02:26.302 --> 01:02:29.472
Si An? Do you think Min Chae stole him?

1427
01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.201
Are you jealous?

1428
01:02:31.302 --> 01:02:33.200
How can you be jealous already?

1429
01:02:33.201 --> 01:02:35.301
As time passes by,

1430
01:02:35.302 --> 01:02:36.810
you won't be jealous anymore.

1431
01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:41.410
I want Si An and Min Chae to come fast!

1432
01:02:41.411 --> 01:02:43.152
(She's emotional.)

1433
01:02:43.282 --> 01:02:44.851
Okay, then.

1434
01:02:45.081 --> 01:02:48.120
Shall we take a peek at what they're doing?

1435
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:49.890
- Hurry, hurry.
- Okay, let's go.

1436
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:51.250
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

1437
01:02:51.251 --> 01:02:52.692
Let's go!

1438
01:02:53.092 --> 01:02:56.060
(Si An is having a happy time.)

1439
01:02:56.061 --> 01:02:58.061
Should we sit here?

1440
01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:01.331
Hold on.

1441
01:03:02.302 --> 01:03:06.402
(He's placing a handkerchief for her.)

1442
01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:09.140
- Sit down.
- Okay.

1443
01:03:09.141 --> 01:03:10.911
Min Chae, sit here.

1444
01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:15.951
(Si An prepared something else.)

1445
01:03:16.212 --> 01:03:19.221
Min Chae, do you like jelly?

1446
01:03:19.222 --> 01:03:20.251
Yes.

1447
01:03:20.282 --> 01:03:23.120
(He's busy looking after Min Chae.)

1448
01:03:23.121 --> 01:03:26.262
Make sure you chew well.

1449
01:03:27.092 --> 01:03:29.160
(I'll feed you this time.)

1450
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:31.230
I'll feed you this time.

1451
01:03:31.231 --> 01:03:33.161
(Really?)

1452
01:03:34.161 --> 01:03:37.132
(Open up, Si An!)

1453
01:03:39.302 --> 01:03:41.200
(I had the sweetest jelly
in the world today.)

1454
01:03:41.201 --> 01:03:42.712
It's delicious.

1455
01:03:46.512 --> 01:03:49.081
Look at that.

1456
01:03:49.152 --> 01:03:51.181
(There is a mosquito.)

1457
01:03:51.681 --> 01:03:54.121
Your face. It's on your face.

1458
01:03:54.222 --> 01:03:56.821
(Stupid mosquito!)

1459
01:03:56.822 --> 01:03:58.390
I'm scared.

1460
01:03:58.391 --> 01:04:00.120
(I'm scared of bugs.)

1461
01:04:00.121 --> 01:04:01.822
(If you're scared...)

1462
01:04:02.362 --> 01:04:04.032
I was scared.

1463
01:04:05.431 --> 01:04:08.561
Si An is brave, so it's okay.

1464
01:04:09.072 --> 01:04:11.700
I'll protect you.

1465
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:13.601
(He's so brave.)

1466
01:04:15.201 --> 01:04:18.371
(Si An is so cool.)

1467
01:04:19.041 --> 01:04:22.411
(What a reliable friend.)

1468
01:04:24.012 --> 01:04:26.551
Min Chae, do you like me?

1469
01:04:26.552 --> 01:04:28.851
(Min Chae, do you like me?)

1470
01:04:28.891 --> 01:04:29.891
Yes.

1471
01:04:31.222 --> 01:04:34.362
(Grinning)

1472
01:04:35.931 --> 01:04:39.361
Si An, do you like me?

1473
01:04:39.362 --> 01:04:42.132
Yes. I like you because you're pretty.

1474
01:04:47.001 --> 01:04:50.012
(Gulping)

1475
01:04:50.972 --> 01:04:53.781
(What are you even thinking?)

1476
01:04:53.782 --> 01:04:56.851
(Gosh, my naughty lips.)

1477
01:04:57.882 --> 01:05:02.152
(The atmosphere is a little strange.)

1478
01:05:03.152 --> 01:05:06.962
(Si An's face is red.)

1479
01:05:08.661 --> 01:05:11.692
(Si An is approaching her.)

1480
01:05:12.331 --> 01:05:15.402
(Is it a sudden kiss?)

1481
01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:21.271
(He's showing off his eyebrows.)

1482
01:05:22.172 --> 01:05:25.112
(He makes Min Chae laugh.)

1483
01:05:26.081 --> 01:05:29.850
(There are dark shadows watching them.)

1484
01:05:29.851 --> 01:05:32.281
- Did they just kiss?
- Yes.

1485
01:05:32.282 --> 01:05:34.981
How strange.

1486
01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:37.120
We caught you!

1487
01:05:37.121 --> 01:05:39.621
- We saw you kiss.
- We caught you.

1488
01:05:40.362 --> 01:05:42.361
- We saw you kiss.
- We saw you.

1489
01:05:42.362 --> 01:05:43.730
We saw it all.

1490
01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:45.501
Hey! No.

1491
01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:47.461
- No.
- We saw you.

1492
01:05:47.462 --> 01:05:49.572
We saw you kiss.

1493
01:05:49.701 --> 01:05:50.871
Right?

1494
01:05:51.431 --> 01:05:53.600
- How was it?
- What is this?

1495
01:05:53.601 --> 01:05:56.871
What is it? Are you going to protect her?

1496
01:06:00.512 --> 01:06:03.680
Okay. Seol A, Soo A...

1497
01:06:03.681 --> 01:06:05.652
- Me.
- Here.

1498
01:06:07.382 --> 01:06:08.421
(Dad's homemade burger)

1499
01:06:08.422 --> 01:06:10.191
What's for dinner with Min Chae?

1500
01:06:10.192 --> 01:06:12.521
It's Dong Gook's homemade burgers.

1501
01:06:13.362 --> 01:06:16.791
You're good at eating, Min Chae.

1502
01:06:18.692 --> 01:06:22.031
Here. I'll wipe you with this.

1503
01:06:22.032 --> 01:06:24.631
- Good. Wipe her.
- I got it on my hand.

1504
01:06:24.632 --> 01:06:26.471
She has it on her hand. Wipe her hand.

1505
01:06:26.472 --> 01:06:27.971
(Si An is being such a gentleman.)

1506
01:06:27.972 --> 01:06:29.072
Wipe it for her.

1507
01:06:30.712 --> 01:06:31.770
(This looks familiar...)

1508
01:06:31.771 --> 01:06:34.742
A scene is passing by in Seol A's head.

1509
01:06:36.052 --> 01:06:39.481
(The day Min Ha came over)

1510
01:06:40.021 --> 01:06:41.281
- His mom...
- Did you eat?

1511
01:06:41.282 --> 01:06:42.751
Did you get it on you?

1512
01:06:42.891 --> 01:06:44.091
It's on him.

1513
01:06:44.092 --> 01:06:46.992
(The twins were busy
taking care of Min Ha.)

1514
01:06:47.992 --> 01:06:51.462
(Look at me.)

1515
01:06:51.962 --> 01:06:55.132
(They had no interest in their brother.)

1516
01:06:55.302 --> 01:06:56.700
Si An has some on too.

1517
01:06:56.701 --> 01:06:59.541
(Si An was invisible to the twins.)

1518
01:07:01.072 --> 01:07:03.972
(He's wiping Min Chae's hand.)

1519
01:07:05.782 --> 01:07:09.781
Aren't you going to wipe my hand?

1520
01:07:09.782 --> 01:07:12.481
You're too far to wipe.

1521
01:07:12.851 --> 01:07:15.750
(Is this too far for you?)

1522
01:07:15.751 --> 01:07:17.421
Why won't you wipe mine?

1523
01:07:17.422 --> 01:07:20.192
He's taking his revenge.

1524
01:07:20.791 --> 01:07:22.632
I don't want to eat it.

1525
01:07:22.962 --> 01:07:26.032
Min Chae won't like you then.

1526
01:07:26.831 --> 01:07:28.430
She won't play with you.

1527
01:07:28.431 --> 01:07:30.032
(Wait, that's not good.)

1528
01:07:30.532 --> 01:07:31.972
I'll eat it.

1529
01:07:33.601 --> 01:07:35.410
(Wide)

1530
01:07:35.411 --> 01:07:36.910
(He's eating so well.)

1531
01:07:36.911 --> 01:07:39.711
Min Chae, look at how well he eats.

1532
01:07:39.712 --> 01:07:41.911
Min Chae, do you like good eaters?

1533
01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:44.712
- Yes.
- Do you like Soo A?

1534
01:07:45.822 --> 01:07:47.180
Do you like Soo A?

1535
01:07:47.181 --> 01:07:49.291
She eats well. Do you like her?

1536
01:07:49.492 --> 01:07:50.821
She eats like a hippopotamus.

1537
01:07:50.822 --> 01:07:52.142
(Soo A eats like a hippopotamus.)

1538
01:07:52.362 --> 01:07:53.661
Like a hippopotamus,

1539
01:07:54.262 --> 01:07:55.791
She eats a lot.

1540
01:07:55.992 --> 01:07:57.660
- She stuffs herself.
- Even still,

1541
01:07:57.661 --> 01:08:00.032
you shouldn't call her a hippopotamus.

1542
01:08:01.201 --> 01:08:04.472
If you don't want it, give it to me.

1543
01:08:04.931 --> 01:08:07.270
- Can I eat it?
- Yes.

1544
01:08:07.271 --> 01:08:09.871
Since I'm cool, you can have it.

1545
01:08:10.442 --> 01:08:13.211
(Yes, you're cool.)

1546
01:08:13.212 --> 01:08:15.411
How did today go, Min Chae?

1547
01:08:15.581 --> 01:08:17.250
It was fun.

1548
01:08:17.251 --> 01:08:19.821
What about you, Min Chae? What was best?

1549
01:08:19.882 --> 01:08:21.682
- See-saw.
- The see-saw?

1550
01:08:23.151 --> 01:08:25.592
Si An, she liked riding with you.

1551
01:08:26.222 --> 01:08:27.892
(Grinning)

1552
01:08:28.592 --> 01:08:31.261
(Dong Gook is excited
about Si An's romance.)

1553
01:08:31.262 --> 01:08:33.000
(Yes, that's it.)

1554
01:08:33.001 --> 01:08:34.700
Good job.

1555
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:36.931
Si An really likes me.

1556
01:08:36.932 --> 01:08:38.700
You talk so nicely.

1557
01:08:38.701 --> 01:08:40.870
Yes, she does.

1558
01:08:40.871 --> 01:08:42.410
Si An does too.

1559
01:08:42.411 --> 01:08:44.211
Si An is cool when he talks.

1560
01:08:44.212 --> 01:08:45.981
Do you talk cool?

1561
01:08:45.982 --> 01:08:47.081
Yes.

1562
01:08:47.182 --> 01:08:48.610
He keeps on saying...

1563
01:08:48.611 --> 01:08:51.581
he talks cool.

1564
01:08:51.651 --> 01:08:54.121
He should talk like this.

1565
01:08:54.352 --> 01:08:56.351
I'm cool when I talk.

1566
01:08:56.352 --> 01:08:59.160
Okay.
- "I'm cool when I talk."

1567
01:08:59.161 --> 01:09:00.161
(What's wrong with him?)

1568
01:09:01.161 --> 01:09:04.160
(Min Chae, my sisters are just joking.)

1569
01:09:04.161 --> 01:09:05.761
It's time to say bye. Min Chae has to go.

1570
01:09:05.762 --> 01:09:07.301
Her mom is coming.

1571
01:09:07.302 --> 01:09:09.400
- You had fun, right?
- Yes!

1572
01:09:09.401 --> 01:09:12.441
Come visit again.

1573
01:09:12.701 --> 01:09:13.900
(A sad goodbye kiss)

1574
01:09:13.901 --> 01:09:15.271
- Good.
- Bye.

1575
01:09:15.272 --> 01:09:16.671
Bye.

1576
01:09:16.672 --> 01:09:18.780
Tell her to dream... She's here!

1577
01:09:18.781 --> 01:09:19.940
- Say, dream about me.
- Mom!

1578
01:09:19.941 --> 01:09:21.581
- Your mom's here.
- Mom!

1579
01:09:24.482 --> 01:09:27.021
- Mom! Mom!
- Hello.

1580
01:09:27.022 --> 01:09:28.181
(Si An is sulking.)

1581
01:09:28.182 --> 01:09:30.352
Si An, say your goodbye.

1582
01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:32.320
Give her a hug.

1583
01:09:32.321 --> 01:09:34.092
(Are you really leaving?)

1584
01:09:35.932 --> 01:09:37.331
See you tomorrow.

1585
01:09:38.062 --> 01:09:40.901
Min Chae, I love you.

1586
01:09:43.501 --> 01:09:45.331
How nice.

1587
01:09:45.701 --> 01:09:47.342
- It's so nice.
- Nice.

1588
01:09:47.941 --> 01:09:52.641
(The father and daughter
are here to practice.)

1589
01:09:52.642 --> 01:09:54.240
Hello.

1590
01:09:54.241 --> 01:09:55.781
I'm practicing by myself today.

1591
01:09:57.651 --> 01:10:00.121
- Thank you.
- Where's her mom today?

1592
01:10:00.852 --> 01:10:03.290
- Dad.
- Am I your dad?

1593
01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:04.790
(She's brave even without her mom.)

1594
01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:07.592
Let's go. I have to go skate.

1595
01:10:08.361 --> 01:10:09.490
Should we go this way?

1596
01:10:09.491 --> 01:10:10.791
(It's the skaters' locker room.)

1597
01:10:12.401 --> 01:10:14.261
(Amazed)

1598
01:10:14.262 --> 01:10:15.602
What is all this?

1599
01:10:16.232 --> 01:10:17.672
What is that?

1600
01:10:18.632 --> 01:10:19.870
I'm tying my laces.

1601
01:10:19.871 --> 01:10:20.941
Yes.

1602
01:10:21.701 --> 01:10:23.110
(Giggling)

1603
01:10:23.111 --> 01:10:25.641
You've never seen me tying skates, right?

1604
01:10:25.642 --> 01:10:27.162
(She's excited just looking at laces.)

1605
01:10:28.342 --> 01:10:30.080
- Jane.
- Jane!

1606
01:10:30.081 --> 01:10:31.410
Say hello.

1607
01:10:31.411 --> 01:10:32.751
Hello.

1608
01:10:32.852 --> 01:10:35.522
Who is the girl giving Jane a hug?

1609
01:10:36.852 --> 01:10:39.392
(Coach Alex and his daughter Vicka)

1610
01:10:40.762 --> 01:10:42.331
I like it.

1611
01:10:42.791 --> 01:10:44.962
You're exactly the same as your dad.

1612
01:10:45.701 --> 01:10:47.161
Let's skate.

1613
01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:49.501
Let's skate, Jane.

1614
01:10:50.071 --> 01:10:52.571
(Jane is wearing her first skates.)

1615
01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:57.172
Are you two ready to skate?

1616
01:10:58.172 --> 01:10:59.842
I'll go for a round.

1617
01:11:00.111 --> 01:11:01.280
Bye.

1618
01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:03.481
(He's skating fast...)

1619
01:11:03.482 --> 01:11:05.150
(thanks to Jane's support.)

1620
01:11:05.151 --> 01:11:08.551
Victor is back to being
a short track skater...

1621
01:11:08.552 --> 01:11:10.490
as he focuses on his practice.

1622
01:11:10.491 --> 01:11:12.422
(He's always on top of his training.)

1623
01:11:14.821 --> 01:11:16.691
Dad.

1624
01:11:17.632 --> 01:11:20.530
He's skating harder at Jane's cheers.

1625
01:11:20.531 --> 01:11:25.071
(There's no hesitation
as he turns corners.)

1626
01:11:25.871 --> 01:11:27.302
Dad.

1627
01:11:27.571 --> 01:11:31.241
Dad. Dad.

1628
01:11:31.611 --> 01:11:34.040
Dad. Dad.

1629
01:11:34.041 --> 01:11:35.982
(Victor has to look after
Jane time to time.)

1630
01:11:36.682 --> 01:11:40.051
High-five. High-five.

1631
01:11:40.052 --> 01:11:41.482
(Dad, you're great!)

1632
01:11:42.491 --> 01:11:43.852
How do you feel?

1633
01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:45.150
Great.

1634
01:11:45.151 --> 01:11:46.191
Great.

1635
01:11:46.491 --> 01:11:49.592
Good. Good. Great.

1636
01:11:51.632 --> 01:11:54.660
(Victor and Alex are having a discussion.)

1637
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:57.701
(When is this over?)

1638
01:11:58.701 --> 01:12:01.870
(Jane is reaching out to her dad.)

1639
01:12:01.871 --> 01:12:03.571
(She's kicking.)

1640
01:12:04.871 --> 01:12:06.811
(She misses her dad.)

1641
01:12:06.812 --> 01:12:07.841
Come to dad.

1642
01:12:07.842 --> 01:12:09.651
(She misses her dad.)

1643
01:12:13.321 --> 01:12:14.481
(Piggybacking)

1644
01:12:14.482 --> 01:12:15.552
Great.

1645
01:12:18.791 --> 01:12:20.591
What is this now?

1646
01:12:20.592 --> 01:12:21.722
(What is that pink object?)

1647
01:12:22.991 --> 01:12:27.400
(He received a baby blanket from his fans.)

1648
01:12:27.401 --> 01:12:31.232
(Is it a blanket?)

1649
01:12:32.142 --> 01:12:36.172
(Who would have thought he'd use it here?)

1650
01:12:37.371 --> 01:12:40.982
(The coach is helping Victor.)

1651
01:12:41.682 --> 01:12:43.250
(Jane has never used this before.)

1652
01:12:43.251 --> 01:12:45.312
Jane has never used the baby blanket.

1653
01:12:45.382 --> 01:12:47.320
Will she like it?

1654
01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:48.621
(She looks uncomfortable.)

1655
01:12:50.892 --> 01:12:53.262
The world's first baby piggyback skating.

1656
01:12:53.291 --> 01:12:56.392
It's only possible with a skater dad.

1657
01:12:57.732 --> 01:12:59.062
Are you okay?

1658
01:12:59.661 --> 01:13:03.531
(His thigh muscles are
used for piggybacks.)

1659
01:13:05.901 --> 01:13:08.571
One, two. One, two.

1660
01:13:08.941 --> 01:13:11.871
One, two. One, two.

1661
01:13:15.451 --> 01:13:17.352
Jane!

1662
01:13:17.951 --> 01:13:19.921
Hello.

1663
01:13:19.922 --> 01:13:21.382
(This is so much fun.)

1664
01:13:22.022 --> 01:13:24.392
Are you having fun? Do you like it?

1665
01:13:26.821 --> 01:13:31.262
(The practice is over. Let's go play!)

1666
01:13:32.732 --> 01:13:36.732
After practice, Victor and Jane...

1667
01:13:36.772 --> 01:13:39.772
are visiting a traditional market.

1668
01:13:42.941 --> 01:13:44.571
There are a lot of stuff.

1669
01:13:45.142 --> 01:13:46.241
What is it?

1670
01:13:47.111 --> 01:13:51.051
It's a famous market
full of arts and crafts.

1671
01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:52.551
(Moscow's traditional market)

1672
01:13:52.552 --> 01:13:55.182
Since we received gifts from Korea,

1673
01:13:55.392 --> 01:13:57.291
let's buy gifts to send back.

1674
01:13:57.592 --> 01:14:00.022
You can choose. What do you like?

1675
01:14:00.691 --> 01:14:02.022
Which one do you like?

1676
01:14:03.132 --> 01:14:04.791
This one? Do you like that?

1677
01:14:05.802 --> 01:14:07.201
Should I open it?

1678
01:14:07.501 --> 01:14:08.932
Did you just kiss it?

1679
01:14:09.031 --> 01:14:10.271
You can choose.

1680
01:14:10.272 --> 01:14:11.471
(A music box?)

1681
01:14:11.472 --> 01:14:12.700
I'll buy it for you.

1682
01:14:12.701 --> 01:14:13.941
(Grabbing)

1683
01:14:14.001 --> 01:14:15.301
Do you like this one?

1684
01:14:15.302 --> 01:14:16.741
(She loves matryoshka.)

1685
01:14:19.012 --> 01:14:20.240
Who is that?

1686
01:14:20.241 --> 01:14:21.841
(They discovered something interesting.)

1687
01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:23.511
He's the president of Russia.

1688
01:14:23.512 --> 01:14:25.150
(It's a Putin matryoshka.)

1689
01:14:25.151 --> 01:14:26.482
Look, Jane.

1690
01:14:27.081 --> 01:14:28.892
The Korean president is here too.

1691
01:14:30.352 --> 01:14:31.592
Look.

1692
01:14:33.462 --> 01:14:35.932
Jane, a hat. Do you want to try?

1693
01:14:36.092 --> 01:14:38.191
- Yes.
- Okay, which one?

1694
01:14:39.031 --> 01:14:41.432
I'll let you try a colorful one.

1695
01:14:42.331 --> 01:14:44.972
(What did Victor pick?)

1696
01:14:50.441 --> 01:14:53.481
(She looks like G-Dragon.)

1697
01:14:53.482 --> 01:14:55.611
Mom.

1698
01:14:56.581 --> 01:14:59.621
Jane is attracting a lot of attention.

1699
01:15:00.081 --> 01:15:01.522
How adorable.

1700
01:15:02.491 --> 01:15:04.691
Thank you.

1701
01:15:05.922 --> 01:15:07.861
Thank you, thank you.

1702
01:15:09.031 --> 01:15:11.790
We bought a matryoshka...

1703
01:15:11.791 --> 01:15:13.361
and a hat.

1704
01:15:14.062 --> 01:15:15.871
- Hat.
- Yes.

1705
01:15:16.732 --> 01:15:18.672
(Excuse me!)

1706
01:15:19.071 --> 01:15:22.000
A mysterious man is stopping Victor.

1707
01:15:22.001 --> 01:15:25.272
(A suspicious man is approaching.)

1708
01:15:28.581 --> 01:15:30.780
I want pictures.

1709
01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:31.911
- A photo.
- Okay.

1710
01:15:32.581 --> 01:15:35.221
(He wants a picture of Victor as a fan.)

1711
01:15:35.222 --> 01:15:37.892
- A selfie?
- Yes, a selfie is good.

1712
01:15:40.922 --> 01:15:44.031
(Hey, I want to get in.)

1713
01:15:47.632 --> 01:15:50.732
People are gathering after
recognizing Victor.

1714
01:15:51.001 --> 01:15:53.602
Jane's dad is so popular.

1715
01:15:54.642 --> 01:15:57.642
(Confused)

1716
01:15:58.672 --> 01:16:03.182
(Jane, your father is so amazing.)

1717
01:16:04.751 --> 01:16:07.321
- Are you training now?
- Yes, I am.

1718
01:16:09.451 --> 01:16:10.891
He's an Olympic champion too.

1719
01:16:10.892 --> 01:16:12.861
Really? In what sport?

1720
01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:15.562
- Wrestling.
- Oh, wrestling?

1721
01:16:16.361 --> 01:16:18.631
He continues to take
pictures with his fans.

1722
01:16:18.632 --> 01:16:20.932
I'm so proud.

1723
01:16:22.331 --> 01:16:27.071
(This is how famous an
Olympic champion is.)

1724
01:16:29.342 --> 01:16:30.571
Could I shake your hand?

1725
01:16:34.142 --> 01:16:35.142
(What's going on?)

1726
01:16:35.143 --> 01:16:36.151
Bye, bye.

1727
01:16:37.751 --> 01:16:40.052
- You were so good.
- Thank you.

1728
01:16:43.222 --> 01:16:44.422
Hello.

1729
01:16:47.922 --> 01:16:49.092
Thank you.

1730
01:16:50.592 --> 01:16:51.931
(He's good at Korean.)

1731
01:16:51.932 --> 01:16:52.962
Let's go.

1732
01:16:54.432 --> 01:16:55.901
- Not this one.
- It's a present.

1733
01:16:56.632 --> 01:16:58.802
It's a present.

1734
01:16:59.602 --> 01:17:00.841
She gave this to you.

1735
01:17:00.842 --> 01:17:02.611
(What a generous lady.)

1736
01:17:03.212 --> 01:17:05.611
- Jane. It's a present.
- Jane.

1737
01:17:06.312 --> 01:17:08.410
(Jane is getting a lot of presents.)

1738
01:17:08.411 --> 01:17:10.512
You have to thank him. Thank you.

1739
01:17:10.552 --> 01:17:11.650
Thank you.

1740
01:17:11.651 --> 01:17:14.750
(Jane is just as popular.)

1741
01:17:14.751 --> 01:17:16.751
Say thank you, Jane. Thank you.

1742
01:17:17.092 --> 01:17:18.250
Thank you.

1743
01:17:18.251 --> 01:17:20.061
(I'm so happy.)

1744
01:17:20.062 --> 01:17:21.092
Thank you.

1745
01:17:23.661 --> 01:17:26.831
(An elderly lady is approaching Jane.)

1746
01:17:27.031 --> 01:17:29.071
Look at that.

1747
01:17:29.401 --> 01:17:31.571
Why is this written on here?

1748
01:17:33.972 --> 01:17:37.071
(Stop asking me, I'm a girl.)

1749
01:17:37.512 --> 01:17:40.541
But you're so pretty.

1750
01:17:41.512 --> 01:17:43.911
What do you mean stop asking you?

1751
01:17:45.722 --> 01:17:49.392
People keep asking us if
she's a girl or a boy.

1752
01:17:49.892 --> 01:17:52.490
Then I tell them she's a girl.

1753
01:17:52.491 --> 01:17:53.931
- She looks like a girl.
- Does she?

1754
01:17:57.432 --> 01:17:58.632
Give her one.

1755
01:17:58.932 --> 01:18:00.462
(Have a bite.)

1756
01:18:01.501 --> 01:18:04.601
Thank you. I don't need it.

1757
01:18:04.602 --> 01:18:07.500
You can have it. Thank you.

1758
01:18:07.501 --> 01:18:09.111
(Then you have it, Dad.)

1759
01:18:09.672 --> 01:18:11.941
You gave it to your dad. Good job.

1760
01:18:16.951 --> 01:18:20.151
(He's trying on a traditional hat.)

1761
01:18:20.781 --> 01:18:22.022
Do you want to try?

1762
01:18:23.651 --> 01:18:24.790
Do you like it?

1763
01:18:24.791 --> 01:18:26.462
(She looks so cute.)

1764
01:18:27.222 --> 01:18:29.392
(I love it.)

1765
01:18:30.392 --> 01:18:32.201
(How adorable.)

1766
01:18:33.401 --> 01:18:34.462
Jane, come here.

1767
01:18:36.701 --> 01:18:39.101
(Jane has a good sense of balance.)

1768
01:18:39.102 --> 01:18:40.201
She's an athlete too.

1769
01:18:40.642 --> 01:18:42.212
It's because her dad...

1770
01:18:42.241 --> 01:18:44.871
- is good at skating.
- Let's go that way.

1771
01:18:46.541 --> 01:18:49.251
Jane, let's go eat corn.

1772
01:18:49.581 --> 01:18:51.111
(I'd love that.)

1773
01:18:51.512 --> 01:18:54.281
Hot. Hot.

1774
01:18:54.581 --> 01:18:55.821
Hot?

1775
01:18:56.722 --> 01:18:58.991
(Boiled corn is Jane's favorite.)

1776
01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:02.631
Jane, it's hot. I'll give it to you.

1777
01:19:02.632 --> 01:19:03.792
(She's begging for the corn.)

1778
01:19:04.331 --> 01:19:06.232
- Dad.
- Dad.

1779
01:19:06.632 --> 01:19:08.400
(Dad, hurry!)

1780
01:19:08.401 --> 01:19:10.531
Touch it. It's too hot. Touch it.

1781
01:19:10.701 --> 01:19:12.272
It's hot, right?

1782
01:19:13.272 --> 01:19:14.301
Dad.

1783
01:19:14.302 --> 01:19:15.610
(Jane is in a rush.)

1784
01:19:15.611 --> 01:19:17.272
Okay. Gosh, it's hot.

1785
01:19:21.781 --> 01:19:22.851
Blow on it.

1786
01:19:22.852 --> 01:19:24.111
(There's no time to blow.)

1787
01:19:26.022 --> 01:19:27.121
It's too hot.

1788
01:19:28.182 --> 01:19:29.651
- Hot.
- Yes, it's hot.

1789
01:19:29.892 --> 01:19:32.892
Yes, it's hot. It's too hot.

1790
01:19:33.092 --> 01:19:34.661
I'll cool it for you.

1791
01:19:34.722 --> 01:19:39.132
(Jane's dying to have it.)

1792
01:19:40.331 --> 01:19:41.932
It's too hot to eat.

1793
01:19:43.302 --> 01:19:44.302
(I can't wait anymore.)

1794
01:19:44.303 --> 01:19:46.540
It's too hot, Jane.

1795
01:19:46.541 --> 01:19:48.740
(Her passion for corn is just as hot.)

1796
01:19:48.741 --> 01:19:50.911
Wait a little more. It's too hot.

1797
01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:52.780
You can blow on it. Good.

1798
01:19:52.781 --> 01:19:53.981
(Biting)

1799
01:19:53.982 --> 01:19:55.751
Did you eat it? Isn't it hot?

1800
01:19:56.281 --> 01:19:57.611
It's hot.

1801
01:19:58.012 --> 01:19:59.251
Try just a little bit.

1802
01:20:01.552 --> 01:20:02.591
Hot.

1803
01:20:02.592 --> 01:20:04.922
(It's so hot!)

1804
01:20:05.522 --> 01:20:06.562
Was it hot?

1805
01:20:06.892 --> 01:20:11.462
(Her craving overpowers the heat.)

1806
01:20:13.831 --> 01:20:15.672
Let's go around.

1807
01:20:17.701 --> 01:20:18.802
Let's go.

1808
01:20:19.672 --> 01:20:21.342
- Salute.
- Salute.

1809
01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:25.370
Don't throw out your garbage here.

1810
01:20:25.371 --> 01:20:27.312
(Everyone, listen to me.)

1811
01:20:27.342 --> 01:20:29.012
Okay, we won't.

1812
01:20:29.281 --> 01:20:31.382
Don't run, it's dangerous.

1813
01:20:31.611 --> 01:20:33.751
There are so many ants.

1814
01:20:34.052 --> 01:20:36.552
Don't run.

1815
01:20:36.722 --> 01:20:38.321
Let's cross.

1816
01:20:38.451 --> 01:20:40.892
You can't cross when it's red light.

1817
01:20:42.291 --> 01:20:44.892
You can't cross when it's red light.

1818
01:20:45.232 --> 01:20:46.262
Okay.

1819
01:20:47.401 --> 01:20:50.102
Wow, Seung Jae. What a serious policeman.

1820
01:20:51.632 --> 01:20:52.772
Hello.

1821
01:20:52.802 --> 01:20:55.041
- Yes, hello.
- I called earlier.

1822
01:20:55.071 --> 01:20:56.440
- I'm Ko Ji Yong.
- Yes.

1823
01:20:56.441 --> 01:20:58.342
- Hello.
- Hello.

1824
01:20:58.411 --> 01:20:59.681
Are you Seung Jae?

1825
01:20:59.682 --> 01:21:02.451
I want to volunteer with Seung Jae.

1826
01:21:02.482 --> 01:21:04.751
Is there something we can do?

1827
01:21:05.111 --> 01:21:07.320
We have action officers.

1828
01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:10.521
You have to visit the elderly...

1829
01:21:10.522 --> 01:21:14.262
and ask how they're doing.
You have to visit them.

1830
01:21:14.321 --> 01:21:16.330
We would appreciate it if you could help.

1831
01:21:16.331 --> 01:21:17.591
- Can you do a good job?
- Yes.

1832
01:21:17.592 --> 01:21:18.931
Good luck.

1833
01:21:18.932 --> 01:21:20.131
(They're action officers for the day!)

1834
01:21:20.132 --> 01:21:22.031
- Please do a good job.
- Okay.

1835
01:21:22.272 --> 01:21:24.701
We have a car prepared.

1836
01:21:25.001 --> 01:21:27.171
You can go around together.

1837
01:21:27.172 --> 01:21:28.700
Please do a good job.

1838
01:21:28.701 --> 01:21:31.142
(They make visits to those in need.)

1839
01:21:31.672 --> 01:21:34.040
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

1840
01:21:34.041 --> 01:21:35.852
(Action Officer Seung Jae is on his way!)

1841
01:21:36.382 --> 01:21:39.081
Move out of the way, honk.

1842
01:21:39.121 --> 01:21:40.780
Let's go, Seung Jae.

1843
01:21:40.781 --> 01:21:43.121
(They arrived at the first house.)

1844
01:21:44.592 --> 01:21:47.462
Dad, I'm looking for thieves.

1845
01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:49.392
(On guard)

1846
01:21:49.562 --> 01:21:51.731
Seung Jae, we're going to
an elderly lady's home.

1847
01:21:51.732 --> 01:21:53.562
You have to ask her if she's doing okay.

1848
01:21:54.132 --> 01:21:56.200
Hello, grandma.

1849
01:21:56.201 --> 01:21:58.200
(Grandma, are you home?)

1850
01:21:58.201 --> 01:22:00.001
Grandma?

1851
01:22:00.371 --> 01:22:02.910
Ma'am? Hello.

1852
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:04.570
Is that a baby? Come in.

1853
01:22:04.571 --> 01:22:07.111
- Hello.
- Hello.

1854
01:22:07.611 --> 01:22:09.052
You have pretty shoes.

1855
01:22:09.382 --> 01:22:11.312
Grandma, you're pretty.

1856
01:22:13.751 --> 01:22:15.052
(She's bringing out snacks.)

1857
01:22:15.922 --> 01:22:18.490
There's this one and this one too.

1858
01:22:18.491 --> 01:22:20.161
(He's happy.)

1859
01:22:21.422 --> 01:22:22.861
What's your name?

1860
01:22:23.161 --> 01:22:24.891
- Ko Seung Jae.
- Ko Seung Jae?

1861
01:22:24.892 --> 01:22:26.901
You're such a good speaker.

1862
01:22:27.201 --> 01:22:28.561
Do you have any leaks?

1863
01:22:28.562 --> 01:22:30.330
Did anything bother you?

1864
01:22:30.331 --> 01:22:32.672
I have a lot I need, but I feel bad.

1865
01:22:33.272 --> 01:22:36.111
We'll do as much as we can.

1866
01:22:36.411 --> 01:22:38.111
One light doesn't work.

1867
01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:40.281
- Your lights?
- The lights?

1868
01:22:40.712 --> 01:22:42.981
That one.

1869
01:22:42.982 --> 01:22:46.281
(Ji Yong is taking a look.)

1870
01:22:47.922 --> 01:22:50.690
I'll go buy the same one...

1871
01:22:50.691 --> 01:22:53.021
and exchange it for you.
Is there a store nearby?

1872
01:22:53.022 --> 01:22:54.320
I'll be right back.

1873
01:22:54.321 --> 01:22:55.962
(He's off to the hardware store.)

1874
01:22:56.932 --> 01:22:58.531
What should we do?

1875
01:22:59.201 --> 01:23:01.562
- What is this?
- It's chili.

1876
01:23:01.831 --> 01:23:03.131
What is this?

1877
01:23:03.132 --> 01:23:04.830
They're chili leaves.

1878
01:23:04.831 --> 01:23:06.371
- It's big.
- My goodness.

1879
01:23:07.401 --> 01:23:08.700
It's big.

1880
01:23:08.701 --> 01:23:11.811
Why are there green ones and red ones?

1881
01:23:11.812 --> 01:23:13.342
This one is old.

1882
01:23:13.812 --> 01:23:15.682
This one is young.

1883
01:23:16.611 --> 01:23:17.711
I want to smell it.

1884
01:23:17.712 --> 01:23:19.922
No, you can't.

1885
01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:21.950
It's so spicy.

1886
01:23:21.951 --> 01:23:24.150
(Screaming)

1887
01:23:24.151 --> 01:23:26.320
(He's overacting just like the grandma.)

1888
01:23:26.321 --> 01:23:27.722
I dried this one.

1889
01:23:28.861 --> 01:23:31.561
(They get along so well.)

1890
01:23:31.562 --> 01:23:32.761
You're so adorable.

1891
01:23:32.762 --> 01:23:35.772
(There's so much laughter,
thanks to chili.)

1892
01:23:37.102 --> 01:23:39.301
- How cute.
- What is this?

1893
01:23:39.302 --> 01:23:40.901
Bring it over. I'll show you.

1894
01:23:43.012 --> 01:23:44.711
Sit down here.

1895
01:23:44.712 --> 01:23:46.152
(Do you want to know what it's for?)

1896
01:23:48.212 --> 01:23:49.811
It goes like this. Gosh, that feels good.

1897
01:23:49.812 --> 01:23:51.011
I want to try.

1898
01:23:51.012 --> 01:23:52.821
Okay, do me. That feels good.

1899
01:23:53.751 --> 01:23:54.922
How nice.

1900
01:23:55.251 --> 01:23:57.851
- Does it feel good?
- Yes, it's great.

1901
01:23:57.852 --> 01:23:59.320
(Seung Jae is giving her a massage.)

1902
01:23:59.321 --> 01:24:01.392
How wonderful.

1903
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:03.591
Put this in your pocket.

1904
01:24:03.592 --> 01:24:05.360
(Put the candy away.)

1905
01:24:05.361 --> 01:24:08.701
Put in another one. Good job.

1906
01:24:08.972 --> 01:24:12.171
Don't tell Dad.

1907
01:24:12.172 --> 01:24:14.801
Okay. I won't tell him.

1908
01:24:14.802 --> 01:24:16.571
(The candy alliance)

1909
01:24:17.172 --> 01:24:19.642
Guess what I'm eating.

1910
01:24:20.712 --> 01:24:22.280
I don't know.

1911
01:24:22.281 --> 01:24:24.881
(They're the best partners.)

1912
01:24:24.882 --> 01:24:27.580
I should make you something delicious.

1913
01:24:27.581 --> 01:24:30.052
What do you like? Do you like potatoes?

1914
01:24:30.321 --> 01:24:31.522
Yes.

1915
01:24:34.422 --> 01:24:37.391
She wants to feed Seung Jae something.

1916
01:24:37.392 --> 01:24:39.461
She's rushing to make potato pancakes.

1917
01:24:39.462 --> 01:24:42.772
(Granny's special potato pancakes)

1918
01:24:43.772 --> 01:24:46.201
Seung Jae, do you know how to eat this?

1919
01:24:46.842 --> 01:24:48.441
It's delicious.

1920
01:24:49.071 --> 01:24:51.610
- Gosh, it's delicious.
- What is it?

1921
01:24:51.611 --> 01:24:54.841
What is it? It's potato pancakes.

1922
01:24:54.842 --> 01:24:57.110
There's ketchup. Try it.

1923
01:24:57.111 --> 01:24:58.580
Gosh, you're good.

1924
01:24:58.581 --> 01:25:00.552
- Hot.
- Is it hot?

1925
01:25:01.022 --> 01:25:02.391
Hurry up and cool down.

1926
01:25:02.392 --> 01:25:04.251
(Hurry up and cool down for Seung Jae.)

1927
01:25:05.592 --> 01:25:07.991
(He's copying her.)

1928
01:25:08.462 --> 01:25:10.530
Try it now. Good.

1929
01:25:10.531 --> 01:25:11.531
(Biting)

1930
01:25:13.462 --> 01:25:15.161
(Delicious)

1931
01:25:18.472 --> 01:25:19.771
It tastes like fries.

1932
01:25:19.772 --> 01:25:21.802
Gosh, you're so smart.

1933
01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:25.212
Seung Jae is in love with
her potato pancakes.

1934
01:25:26.982 --> 01:25:28.382
This time, it's for you.

1935
01:25:29.182 --> 01:25:30.552
That's too big.

1936
01:25:33.651 --> 01:25:34.852
Thank you.

1937
01:25:35.552 --> 01:25:38.422
Ji Yong is rushing over.

1938
01:25:38.892 --> 01:25:41.962
He bought the things the
elderly lady needs.

1939
01:25:43.132 --> 01:25:46.461
(The grandma's house is
filled with laughter.)

1940
01:25:46.462 --> 01:25:48.161
I don't know.

1941
01:25:48.262 --> 01:25:53.272
(She was lonely, but now she's laughing.)

1942
01:25:54.701 --> 01:25:56.041
Your dad is here.

1943
01:25:56.312 --> 01:25:57.871
What is the policeman doing?

1944
01:25:57.911 --> 01:25:59.982
- Why do you have rice?
- I bought it.

1945
01:26:00.312 --> 01:26:02.011
Why would you bother?

1946
01:26:02.012 --> 01:26:04.250
I bought some fruits and rice.

1947
01:26:04.251 --> 01:26:06.051
- My goodness.
- It's nothing.

1948
01:26:06.052 --> 01:26:07.651
- I feel bad.
- Don't be.

1949
01:26:08.022 --> 01:26:10.450
Let me change your lights first.

1950
01:26:10.451 --> 01:26:13.022
Your son is so smart. He talks well too.

1951
01:26:13.722 --> 01:26:14.821
Thank you.

1952
01:26:16.161 --> 01:26:19.762
(Ji Yong is switching the lightbulb.)

1953
01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:23.632
- It's bright.
- It's a lot brighter.

1954
01:26:24.331 --> 01:26:25.601
- We'll come back.
- When?

1955
01:26:25.602 --> 01:26:27.101
We'll come back.

1956
01:26:27.102 --> 01:26:28.811
I'll come after three nights.

1957
01:26:28.812 --> 01:26:30.070
Please visit again.

1958
01:26:30.071 --> 01:26:32.011
Bye, grandma.

1959
01:26:32.012 --> 01:26:34.410
Okay. Take care.

1960
01:26:34.411 --> 01:26:37.311
- Stay healthy.
- Grandma, stay healthy.

1961
01:26:37.312 --> 01:26:38.852
You too.

1962
01:26:39.781 --> 01:26:40.922
Let's go!

1963
01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:42.821
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1964
01:26:43.092 --> 01:26:45.562
- Hello.
- Hello.

1965
01:26:46.762 --> 01:26:48.361
Let's go in. Take your shoes off.

1966
01:26:49.962 --> 01:26:52.661
- I'm here.
- Come in.

1967
01:26:52.762 --> 01:26:54.530
- Hello.
- Hello.

1968
01:26:54.531 --> 01:26:56.001
Gosh, you're cute.

1969
01:26:56.501 --> 01:26:59.142
(A visiting nurse is here too.)

1970
01:26:59.241 --> 01:27:01.701
Why is a nurse here?

1971
01:27:01.802 --> 01:27:05.071
Grandma hurt her knee.

1972
01:27:05.642 --> 01:27:08.110
- The nurse will help.
- Is it a checkup?

1973
01:27:08.111 --> 01:27:09.780
- Yes, it's a checkup.
- Checkup.

1974
01:27:09.781 --> 01:27:11.811
- I want to watch.
- Okay, come watch.

1975
01:27:11.812 --> 01:27:15.022
I want to see if she's brave.

1976
01:27:15.392 --> 01:27:19.990
(Brave grandma is testing
her blood pressure.)

1977
01:27:19.991 --> 01:27:21.592
What is that?

1978
01:27:22.161 --> 01:27:23.661
I'm checking her blood pressure.

1979
01:27:24.132 --> 01:27:26.361
That's part of a checkup.

1980
01:27:27.732 --> 01:27:29.801
Your blood pressure is normal.

1981
01:27:29.802 --> 01:27:31.070
It's 130 over 80.

1982
01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:32.842
What are you listening to?

1983
01:27:33.241 --> 01:27:35.302
- Do you want to hear it?
- Yes!

1984
01:27:35.812 --> 01:27:38.142
- I'll check her.
- Go ahead.

1985
01:27:39.411 --> 01:27:41.080
He must know how to do it.

1986
01:27:41.081 --> 01:27:43.381
(She's surprised.)

1987
01:27:43.382 --> 01:27:44.911
Try over here.

1988
01:27:45.182 --> 01:27:47.650
- How am I?
- I'll fix you.

1989
01:27:47.651 --> 01:27:49.790
Gosh, thank you.

1990
01:27:49.791 --> 01:27:51.751
(His words make her feel better.)

1991
01:27:53.022 --> 01:27:55.831
(Seung Jae, I'm proud of you.)

1992
01:27:56.262 --> 01:27:58.860
Grandma, are you getting a shot?

1993
01:27:58.861 --> 01:28:00.132
Yes.

1994
01:28:00.661 --> 01:28:03.301
I don't want her to get a shot.

1995
01:28:03.302 --> 01:28:06.070
We're checking her blood sugar level.

1996
01:28:06.071 --> 01:28:07.200
What do we do?

1997
01:28:07.201 --> 01:28:08.910
Don't give her a shot.

1998
01:28:08.911 --> 01:28:10.110
Should I not?

1999
01:28:10.111 --> 01:28:11.772
I have to get it since I'm sick.

2000
01:28:15.241 --> 01:28:17.712
(Poking)

2001
01:28:18.951 --> 01:28:21.250
(There's blood coming out from her finger.)

2002
01:28:21.251 --> 01:28:22.391
What do I do?

2003
01:28:22.392 --> 01:28:24.250
(He's stepping back after seeing blood.)

2004
01:28:24.251 --> 01:28:25.562
What do I do?

2005
01:28:27.892 --> 01:28:29.530
Why is she getting a shot?

2006
01:28:29.531 --> 01:28:30.932
Because she's sick.

2007
01:28:31.562 --> 01:28:32.830
My legs hurt the most.

2008
01:28:32.831 --> 01:28:35.631
I'll make an appointment at the clinic.

2009
01:28:35.632 --> 01:28:38.000
I'll take you there and drive you back.

2010
01:28:38.001 --> 01:28:40.371
- Gosh, thank you.
- It's nothing.

2011
01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:42.071
Let's go!

2012
01:28:42.342 --> 01:28:44.211
Move out of the way.

2013
01:28:44.212 --> 01:28:46.040
Grandma is coming.

2014
01:28:46.041 --> 01:28:47.482
(Make way for grandma!)

2015
01:28:51.512 --> 01:28:52.551
Let's go.

2016
01:28:52.552 --> 01:28:54.781
(They're escorting her.)

2017
01:28:56.552 --> 01:28:58.152
(Seung Jae is opening the door for her.)

2018
01:28:58.522 --> 01:29:00.092
Grandma, get on.

2019
01:29:00.422 --> 01:29:01.722
Seung Jae, move.

2020
01:29:01.861 --> 01:29:04.231
I have to move.

2021
01:29:04.232 --> 01:29:05.601
Hold on.

2022
01:29:05.602 --> 01:29:07.160
(I have to go too.)

2023
01:29:07.161 --> 01:29:09.802
(They're sitting in the back together.)

2024
01:29:10.001 --> 01:29:11.172
Good boy.

2025
01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:13.501
- Here we go.
- Okay.

2026
01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:17.910
Does physiotherapy help?

2027
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:21.982
If I get it every day, it feels good.

2028
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:24.450
- However, now...
- You can't go often.

2029
01:29:24.451 --> 01:29:28.080
No. When I used to go, I only had one cane.

2030
01:29:28.081 --> 01:29:30.592
But this year, I need two canes.

2031
01:29:30.751 --> 01:29:32.592
It's embarrassing to go outside.

2032
01:29:33.092 --> 01:29:35.291
I just stay indoors.

2033
01:29:35.691 --> 01:29:37.291
It's too embarrassing.

2034
01:29:39.232 --> 01:29:44.232
(Action Officer Seung
Jae is feeling tired.)

2035
01:29:45.972 --> 01:29:48.200
- The baby is sleeping.
- Yes.

2036
01:29:48.201 --> 01:29:49.511
He must be tired.

2037
01:29:49.512 --> 01:29:51.111
Seung Jae is sleeping,

2038
01:29:51.911 --> 01:29:53.040
so could you look after him?

2039
01:29:53.041 --> 01:29:55.281
I'll take her up to the clinic.

2040
01:29:55.781 --> 01:29:58.951
(Dad, please take good care of her!)

2041
01:30:04.052 --> 01:30:08.061
(She's getting Ji Yong's help.)

2042
01:30:08.062 --> 01:30:11.562
She finally arrived with
Ji Yong in her hand.

2043
01:30:12.462 --> 01:30:15.931
(Her therapy is starting.)

2044
01:30:15.932 --> 01:30:18.272
- It'll get hot soon.
- Okay.

2045
01:30:18.602 --> 01:30:19.802
It's warm.

2046
01:30:20.102 --> 01:30:21.440
- Thank you.
- No problem.

2047
01:30:21.441 --> 01:30:24.011
(Ji Yong is keeping by her side.)

2048
01:30:24.012 --> 01:30:26.540
I'm bothering so many people.

2049
01:30:26.541 --> 01:30:27.982
I feel so bad.

2050
01:30:28.182 --> 01:30:29.852
Don't think like that.

2051
01:30:30.611 --> 01:30:32.250
Then you'll get sad.

2052
01:30:32.251 --> 01:30:33.750
- I hope you get better.
- Okay.

2053
01:30:33.751 --> 01:30:35.921
Grandma, please stay healthy.

2054
01:30:35.922 --> 01:30:37.892
(Get well, grandma!)
