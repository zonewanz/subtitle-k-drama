1
00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:11.461
Mom told me everything. 
It must've surprised you.

2
00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:14.598
I'm sorry...

3
00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:17.834
- I'm sorry for leaving. 
- Listen to me first.

4
00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:21.138
There's something I must tell you.

5
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.508
Go ahead.

6
00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:29.312
Please don't be surprised
 to what I have to say.

7
00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:31.014
Sure.

8
00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:34.217
Ji An,

9
00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:36.853
you must not...

10
00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:39.289
You must not go to them.

11
00:00:41.992 --> 00:00:43.026
Pardon me?

12
00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:50.967
First, I must apologize 
for making you suffer.

13
00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.904
Towards you, Ji Soo,

14
00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:57.040
Ji Tae, Ji Ho, and even your mother,

15
00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:58.675
I'm sorry for everything.

16
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.479
Why do you say such things?

17
00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:04.948
You...

18
00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:07.417
Are you going to them...

19
00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:09.386
so you can get a job?

20
00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:12.055
It's not because they're rich, is it?

21
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.559
That's not the only reason.

22
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.497
Then is it because of our situation?

23
00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.900
Are you worried that they might do us harm?

24
00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:27.104
That's only part of it.

25
00:01:27.104 --> 00:01:28.472
Then...

26
00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:31.608
if you get a job...

27
00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:35.412
I mean, if you can study abroad,

28
00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:37.948
would you stay?

29
00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:39.950
Dad,

30
00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:44.788
do you want to stop me from going to them?

31
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:49.893
No,

32
00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:52.229
that's not it.

33
00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:54.631
Your decision...

34
00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:56.967
Your decision is what matters.

35
00:01:57.968 --> 00:01:59.970
I wanted to know why you made that decision.

36
00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:03.140
They asked me to come.

37
00:02:04.241 --> 00:02:05.542
I understand them.

38
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.245
Then if they say you don't have to come,

39
00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.580
would you stay with us?

40
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:12.849
Even Mom said I must go.

41
00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:15.519
And I can always pay you a visit.

42
00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.655
I mean, if they say you don't need to come,

43
00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:22.092
and if they say...

44
00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.628
that they'll forgive us...

45
00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.300
You...

46
00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:33.870
You don't want to go, right?

47
00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:36.373
Of course, Dad.

48
00:02:36.873 --> 00:02:38.441
I don't want to go.

49
00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:41.645
This is my home.

50
00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:57.060
I want to go.

51
00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.567
What... What?

52
00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:06.102
I...

53
00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:08.672
I also feel sorry for...

54
00:03:08.972 --> 00:03:11.808
Ji Soo, Ji Ho, and Ji Tae.

55
00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:15.645
But I want to go.

56
00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:19.649
You... You want to go?

57
00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:23.420
It's not because you must,

58
00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:26.022
but you want to go?

59
00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:30.994
Why?

60
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.396
Why?

61
00:03:34.764 --> 00:03:36.366
You want to go?

62
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.069
I know you suffered,

63
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.706
but do you really want to leave so easily like this?

64
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.876
Yes, I want to go.

65
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.746
I suffered so much.

66
00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:53.283
I wanted to kill myself. There's nothing I can do.

67
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.086
- Ji An. - Living like this...

68
00:03:57.254 --> 00:03:58.822
I'm sick of living like this.

69
00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:02.392
When other people ignore me and despise me,

70
00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:05.629
it makes me so miserable, poor, and servile.

71
00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.265
I can't stand it anymore.

72
00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:09.299
I mean,

73
00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.936
if it's because of getting a job, I'll try my best...

74
00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:16.306
Why do you want to stop me?

75
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.508
Why shouldn't I go?

76
00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.777
I...

77
00:04:21.745 --> 00:04:23.713
I could've been a regular employee,

78
00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:25.582
but...

79
00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:29.119
But her dad got her the job.

80
00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.889
That's how the world goes. No matter how much I try,

81
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.458
I already didn't deserve to get it.

82
00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.060
I already don't have good grades or qualifications.

83
00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:38.762
How could I get good grades...

84
00:04:38.762 --> 00:04:40.930
when I was working at the same time?

85
00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:43.566
How can I win against kids who got pocket money,

86
00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:45.869
had private lessons, and studied abroad?

87
00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:50.573
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:52.876
Why can't I be a daughter of a rich family?

89
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.879
My real parents are conglomerates.

90
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.249
Why can't I go when they're rich?

91
00:04:59.616 --> 00:05:00.750
I mean,

92
00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:04.487
why did you even pick me up in the first place?

93
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.061
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:00.377
Ji An.

95
00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.247
Ji Soo.

96
00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:07.951
What are you doing here? You should be at work.

97
00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:09.252
Are you not feeling well?

98
00:06:09.886 --> 00:06:12.122
I left early to see you.

99
00:06:12.756 --> 00:06:14.190
I must tell you something.

100
00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:17.427
You could've done that after work.

101
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.429
I thought I would forget it then.

102
00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:21.131
I'm going to Yoon Hee's wedding.

103
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.365
Let's talk about it later.

104
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:27.203
I know why I feel sad and keep crying.

105
00:06:27.504 --> 00:06:29.506
I couldn't believe it at first,

106
00:06:29.506 --> 00:06:31.307
and I was sad that you're not my sister.

107
00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:34.377
I thought it was because I couldn't live with you.

108
00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:35.445
But that wasn't it.

109
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.547
What do you mean?

110
00:06:37.547 --> 00:06:39.582
It was because I couldn't understand you.

111
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.452
Well, you're not me.

112
00:06:42.452 --> 00:06:45.622
You're leaving us because they're rich.

113
00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:47.323
You're going because they're conglomerates.

114
00:06:48.558 --> 00:06:50.760
- Can't I do that? - Of course you can't.

115
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.198
Why can't I? They're my birth parents.

116
00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:56.699
I'm going to my parents' house.

117
00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.135
You're making Mom and Dad miserable.

118
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.771
What?

119
00:07:01.771 --> 00:07:03.373
If you leave, that means...

120
00:07:03.373 --> 00:07:06.309
our parents are poor and incompetent.

121
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.311
You're blaming them...

122
00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:10.213
for not being able to build your resume...

123
00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:11.815
or get a job.

124
00:07:12.382 --> 00:07:14.617
How can you hurt them like that?

125
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:16.319
Are you finished?

126
00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.456
So take back what you said about leaving us.

127
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.458
If you go,

128
00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.626
I will never see you again.

129
00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:25.061
Hey, Seo Ji Soo!

130
00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:27.430
How can you leave us as soon as you found out?

131
00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:29.699
We are your family.

132
00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.001
We spent our whole life with you.

133
00:07:32.068 --> 00:07:33.770
Do we have to be related by blood to be a family?

134
00:07:34.137 --> 00:07:37.640
You can go and visit your birth parents.

135
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.209
Why would you leave us?

136
00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:40.810
This is your home.

137
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.512
I'm your twin sister.

138
00:07:42.512 --> 00:07:44.080
We are your family.

139
00:07:45.315 --> 00:07:47.317
This won't make any difference.

140
00:07:47.517 --> 00:07:49.886
I'm still their daughter and your sister.

141
00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.120
I'm going to come home every day,

142
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.889
have dinner together every night,

143
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.691
and give them a big allowance.

144
00:07:54.691 --> 00:07:56.326
Then why are you leaving?

145
00:07:56.326 --> 00:07:58.561
Because I don't want to be pathetic anymore.

146
00:07:58.828 --> 00:08:00.697
So please give me a break, okay?

147
00:08:01.097 --> 00:08:03.333
So you are leaving because of money.

148
00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:06.870
Hey! How can you leave us just for money?

149
00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:09.772
Just for money?

150
00:08:13.443 --> 00:08:14.511
Do you know what money is?

151
00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:16.579
Do you know about suffering?

152
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:18.515
Do you know how I have been living?

153
00:08:19.215 --> 00:08:22.252
You only lounge around. You know nothing.

154
00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:24.254
I don't care if others criticize me.

155
00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.022
But you don't have the right to criticize me.

156
00:08:26.022 --> 00:08:27.190
Anyone but you.

157
00:08:27.657 --> 00:08:29.125
What is that supposed to mean?

158
00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:30.760
We were born as twin sisters.

159
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.829
No, I thought we were twin sisters.

160
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:35.565
When I took care of you as I your big sister,

161
00:08:35.732 --> 00:08:36.966
what did you do?

162
00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:38.568
You didn't study.

163
00:08:38.568 --> 00:08:40.837
You just did and ate everything you wanted.

164
00:08:40.837 --> 00:08:43.206
Are you now scolding me for how much I eat?

165
00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:53.349
Are you now laughing at me? Are you?

166
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.084
No, you were just adorable.

167
00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.086
I laughed because you were cute.

168
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.722
- I think not. - No, really.

169
00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:04.727
And Ji Soo.

170
00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:08.831
No matter what, I'm leaving.

171
00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:10.967
That's my decision.

172
00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:15.405
So let's not make this any more painful.

173
00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:18.942
Have you really made up your mind?

174
00:09:19.042 --> 00:09:20.977
I'm going to be late for the wedding. Bye.

175
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.046
Hey, Ji An!

176
00:09:23.212 --> 00:09:25.715
You're not my sister anymore. I'm serious.

177
00:09:25.715 --> 00:09:27.450
If you leave, we're done!

178
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.786
Ji Soo, don't say that. It's already hard for me.

179
00:09:30.286 --> 00:09:32.689
The number you have dialed is not available...

180
00:09:35.358 --> 00:09:37.160
He should have at least called me...

181
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.196
if he left after saying that he will make a mess.

182
00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:45.568
(Ji An)

183
00:09:49.205 --> 00:09:50.206
Mom.

184
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:52.575
Ji An.

185
00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:54.811
Did you meet your dad?

186
00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:00.083
You were surprised, right?

187
00:10:01.217 --> 00:10:02.185
Mom,

188
00:10:02.785 --> 00:10:04.454
I'll leave earlier than planned.

189
00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:06.356
What?

190
00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.491
It's so hard to face Dad...

191
00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:10.727
and Ji Soo too.

192
00:10:15.098 --> 00:10:18.167
You set up her room very quickly.

193
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.937
Director Oh must have outdone herself.

194
00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:23.473
I paid her way more than usual.

195
00:10:24.407 --> 00:10:25.408
I see.

196
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.845
(Yang Mi Jung)

197
00:10:29.412 --> 00:10:31.648
Ji An is ready.

198
00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.950
Given our family's circumstances,

199
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.320
I believe it'd be better if she left earlier.

200
00:10:38.087 --> 00:10:39.589
How about tomorrow?

201
00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:45.328
Get this house cleaned. Make sure it's spotless.

202
00:10:45.328 --> 00:10:46.429
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:10:53.603 --> 00:10:54.671
Myung Hee.

204
00:10:58.007 --> 00:10:59.042
Jin Hee.

205
00:10:59.042 --> 00:11:01.044
I heard you found Eun Seok.

206
00:11:03.946 --> 00:11:06.082
Myung Hee, how can you not tell me?

207
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:08.084
What's going on?

208
00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:11.320
Do you still blame me?

209
00:11:11.854 --> 00:11:14.090
Do you still believe that it was my fault?

210
00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:24.934
Now, shall we go to the...

211
00:11:27.737 --> 00:11:28.971
She's sleeping.

212
00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:45.988
Hello?

213
00:11:45.988 --> 00:11:47.557
Myung Hee, where are you?

214
00:11:47.557 --> 00:11:48.658
Why do you ask?

215
00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:51.060
Are you okay? He didn't get you yet?

216
00:11:51.694 --> 00:11:53.196
What are you talking about?

217
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.932
I heard your husband got someone to tail you.

218
00:11:55.932 --> 00:11:57.800
Didn't he get you yet?

219
00:12:00.436 --> 00:12:03.806
My husband has someone tailing me?

220
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.810
Stop joking around, Jin Hee.

221
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.847
If I was joking, I wouldn't warn you.

222
00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:12.715
For our family's sake,

223
00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:15.451
I'm stopping him from ruining your reputation.

224
00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:16.452
What?

225
00:12:17.954 --> 00:12:19.555
Come to Nanny's house in Yangpyeong.

226
00:12:19.555 --> 00:12:22.091
Let her tend to Eun Seok, and let's leave together.

227
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.247
I thought we cleared that after you woke up.

228
00:12:44.814 --> 00:12:47.784
- Was that only one-sided? - Don't assume.

229
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.986
When will you stop? It's vulgar.

230
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.321
Vulgar?

231
00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:54.690
You're always prying around.

232
00:12:55.591 --> 00:12:58.561
What do you want to know? Why did you barge in?

233
00:12:59.962 --> 00:13:01.063
Myung Hee.

234
00:13:01.063 --> 00:13:04.400
We were to visit Ms. Jin at the hospital.

235
00:13:04.934 --> 00:13:06.969
I came in because you didn't call.

236
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.305
I was passing by after my work out.

237
00:13:09.305 --> 00:13:11.307
I saw a truck, and the door was open.

238
00:13:12.408 --> 00:13:16.179
Your sister came in through your open door.

239
00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:17.313
Prying?

240
00:13:17.814 --> 00:13:18.848
Vulgar?

241
00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:21.784
Are you going through menopause too?

242
00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:25.555
I see. I'm sorry.

243
00:13:25.955 --> 00:13:28.457
I forgot to tell you that I couldn't make it.

244
00:13:28.457 --> 00:13:29.659
I made a mistake.

245
00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:33.963
You surprised me from behind so many times.

246
00:13:34.096 --> 00:13:37.200
Let's stop here. I can't outtalk you.

247
00:13:38.167 --> 00:13:39.569
By the way,

248
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.205
when are you bringing her home?

249
00:13:42.805 --> 00:13:44.941
It looks like she'll be here today or tomorrow.

250
00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:47.310
Meet her when I introduce her later.

251
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.444
Don't you think...

252
00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:51.047
she should learn about her own family before you?

253
00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.582
How did she grow up?

254
00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.051
You must have an idea if Dad told you. Why ask?

255
00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:56.452
This is a waste of time.

256
00:13:57.286 --> 00:13:59.355
You should leave. I have a lot to do.

257
00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:03.159
Where are your husband and Do Kyung?

258
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.561
Do Kyung is at the gym.

259
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:07.797
And Jae Sung is golfing with the Entrepreneur...

260
00:14:07.997 --> 00:14:10.433
Association of Seoul National University.

261
00:14:15.338 --> 00:14:17.540
(Late Choi Eun Seok)

262
00:14:26.816 --> 00:14:28.551
Your lease won't end anytime soon.

263
00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:30.086
I guess you are planning to relocate her ashes.

264
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.822
I'll take this out. You can go.

265
00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:53.809
Daughter, congratulations on your 11th birthday.

266
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:55.945
I love you.

267
00:15:00.449 --> 00:15:01.951
(Daughter, congratulations on your 11th birthday.)

268
00:15:01.951 --> 00:15:02.985
(I love you.)

269
00:15:07.556 --> 00:15:09.458
(Myung Hee)

270
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.361
Yes, it's me.

271
00:15:14.397 --> 00:15:15.464
Golf?

272
00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:18.467
Oh, it's almost over.

273
00:15:21.437 --> 00:15:23.172
Eun Seok is coming tomorrow?

274
00:15:33.316 --> 00:15:36.319
Yes, I want to go.

275
00:15:37.153 --> 00:15:40.456
I wanted to kill myself. There's nothing I can do.

276
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.993
When other people ignore me and despise me,

277
00:15:44.293 --> 00:15:47.330
it makes me so miserable, poor, and servile.

278
00:15:48.431 --> 00:15:50.399
I can't stand it anymore.

279
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.969
Why can't I be a daughter of a rich family?

280
00:15:53.936 --> 00:15:57.039
Why did you even pick me up in the first place?

281
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.911
Excuse me.

282
00:16:04.947 --> 00:16:06.048
Sir.

283
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:09.819
Yes?

284
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.821
Are you all right?

285
00:16:12.855 --> 00:16:14.090
Yes.

286
00:16:14.457 --> 00:16:16.859
We had a report that you haven't moved an inch...

287
00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:18.194
standing right here for over an hour.

288
00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:23.332
Can you show us your ID?

289
00:16:26.302 --> 00:16:27.436
Sure.

290
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.981
You live in this area.

291
00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:40.916
What were you doing here?

292
00:16:43.052 --> 00:16:45.321
Nothing... Nothing much. I was just standing.

293
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:47.356
This is a children's playground.

294
00:16:48.157 --> 00:16:49.825
I think kids were very scared.

295
00:16:52.194 --> 00:16:55.231
Oh, I see. Seeing an old man here...

296
00:16:55.831 --> 00:16:57.800
must've scared them a lot.

297
00:16:58.534 --> 00:16:59.935
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:05.374 --> 00:17:07.143
I'm okay.

299
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.817
I apologize.

300
00:17:15.751 --> 00:17:17.253
- Mom, I'm scared. - It's all right.

301
00:17:17.253 --> 00:17:20.256
Please don't worry. He lives in this area.

302
00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:23.192
But how could he... stand there like that...

303
00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:25.361
without budging for over an hour?

304
00:17:25.694 --> 00:17:27.463
Gosh, doesn't his legs hurt?

305
00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.098
Kids were scared.

306
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.941
- Just a second. - Why?

307
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:45.881
How am I? Do I look all right?

308
00:17:45.881 --> 00:17:48.217
Of course. I bet you'll put the groom to shame.

309
00:17:49.118 --> 00:17:51.087
You'll definitely outshine Jae Rok.

310
00:17:51.087 --> 00:17:52.088
You think so?

311
00:17:52.088 --> 00:17:53.923
Why do you look so dashing today?

312
00:17:54.757 --> 00:17:55.758
I'm serious.

313
00:18:00.196 --> 00:18:01.363
You're envious, aren't you?

314
00:18:02.398 --> 00:18:04.467
- Let's go, darling. - Sorry.

315
00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:08.104
What was that about? I'm speechless.

316
00:18:08.237 --> 00:18:10.172
He could do better than you.

317
00:18:10.739 --> 00:18:13.342
What is her problem? Goodness.

318
00:18:13.442 --> 00:18:15.845
- Myung Shin. - Hey, Ji An.

319
00:18:16.645 --> 00:18:19.014
- What's up? - Why are you so late?

320
00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:20.282
A couple teased me.

321
00:18:20.282 --> 00:18:23.953
The woman was like, "Aren't you envious?"

322
00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:25.387
She's too honest.

323
00:18:26.222 --> 00:18:27.556
- Let's go in. - Okay.

324
00:18:31.894 --> 00:18:33.429
This is my boyfriend.

325
00:18:33.963 --> 00:18:35.197
- Hello. - Hello.

326
00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.700
I'm Seo Ji Tae. Congratulations.

327
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.035
Now, I know why Soo A has been hiding you from us.

328
00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:43.439
I'm Choi Jae Rok.

329
00:18:47.576 --> 00:18:49.879
I used to chase after Soo A back in the days.

330
00:18:50.846 --> 00:18:53.115
Hey, Jae Rok. Cut it out.

331
00:18:53.182 --> 00:18:55.117
Why are you joking around on your wedding day?

332
00:18:55.184 --> 00:18:56.685
He wasn't the only guy.

333
00:18:56.919 --> 00:18:59.522
Soo A was the most popular girl in our club.

334
00:18:59.688 --> 00:19:01.457
Guys loved how chic and cool she is.

335
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:04.927
Chic and cool? I guess you used that in college too.

336
00:19:05.194 --> 00:19:06.662
I also fell for that charm of hers.

337
00:19:06.962 --> 00:19:10.299
Enough already. I'm getting old now.

338
00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:12.868
Exactly. That's why you need to get hitched soon.

339
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:15.938
When will you two get married?

340
00:19:16.505 --> 00:19:18.007
We won't get married.

341
00:19:18.607 --> 00:19:19.608
Pardon?

342
00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:23.112
Oh, haven't I told you?

343
00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:24.980
We don't believe in marriage.

344
00:19:25.114 --> 00:19:27.383
They'll stay together without getting married.

345
00:19:28.117 --> 00:19:30.452
We've decided against getting married,

346
00:19:30.553 --> 00:19:33.389
but we hope your marriage to be full of happiness.

347
00:19:33.522 --> 00:19:35.090
Yes, thank you.

348
00:19:35.457 --> 00:19:37.193
I wish you a happy life.

349
00:19:46.702 --> 00:19:48.771
Did your doctor husband teach you that?

350
00:19:48.837 --> 00:19:51.173
Lamaze breathing for week 12 of pregnancy?

351
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.042
By the way, why isn't Myung Shin here yet?

352
00:19:53.209 --> 00:19:54.610
She's best friends with Ji An.

353
00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.011
I knew they wouldn't come.

354
00:19:56.245 --> 00:19:59.348
Ji An may not come, but Myung Shin should.

355
00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:03.018
Yoon Hee, why don't I have to be here?

356
00:20:06.989 --> 00:20:09.458
What is it? Were you hoping I wouldn't come?

357
00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.927
Not at all. You didn't get your contract renewed,

358
00:20:11.927 --> 00:20:13.729
so I figured you probably wouldn't want to come.

359
00:20:13.729 --> 00:20:16.498
Hey, how can I not come to your wedding?

360
00:20:16.498 --> 00:20:18.167
We're close friends.

361
00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:24.139
Ha Jung, you're here too.

362
00:20:25.207 --> 00:20:26.442
Hi, Ji An.

363
00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:30.679
She only found out that day when she got the job.

364
00:20:30.679 --> 00:20:33.382
Her dad told her just before she met us.

365
00:20:34.049 --> 00:20:35.551
Yoon Hee knows.

366
00:20:36.185 --> 00:20:38.721
Ha Jung told me that she heard about it on her way.

367
00:20:38.721 --> 00:20:40.689
I was going to tell you,

368
00:20:40.689 --> 00:20:43.459
but I couldn't because you had to leave.

369
00:20:43.459 --> 00:20:44.460
I see.

370
00:20:49.598 --> 00:20:51.200
Here's the 4,000 dollars.

371
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.202
Sorry I couldn't give you the entire sum at once.

372
00:20:54.603 --> 00:20:55.871
4,000 dollars?

373
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:58.741
The settlement money. I got 1,000 from my old job,

374
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.676
- and this is the rest. - Settlement money?

375
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.446
Ha Jung, you said you had a fight with Ji An.

376
00:21:04.446 --> 00:21:05.914
But settlement money?

377
00:21:05.914 --> 00:21:08.350
I haven't told you girls any details.

378
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.619
I almost lost two front teeth that day.

379
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.589
I heard you went to Jae Rok's dental clinic.

380
00:21:13.722 --> 00:21:14.957
Was it for those teeth?

381
00:21:14.957 --> 00:21:18.227
Jae Rok told me that those teeth are loose...

382
00:21:18.227 --> 00:21:20.029
because of gum infection.

383
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:21.864
You said they've been like that for a long time.

384
00:21:22.231 --> 00:21:24.967
Now, I can see your scenario.

385
00:21:25.401 --> 00:21:28.237
- Hey, Ha Jung. - Girls, that's enough.

386
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:31.040
We're at Yoon Hee's wedding.

387
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.710
And it is true that I beat Ha Jung to a pulp.

388
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.247
I might be in jail now if she didn't settle.

389
00:21:39.782 --> 00:21:43.152
Take it. I promised to give you this money.

390
00:21:49.692 --> 00:21:51.727
There are people who do bad things...

391
00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.162
and make others take the blame.

392
00:21:53.162 --> 00:21:55.464
This is making my blood boil.

393
00:21:56.498 --> 00:21:58.000
Hey, Ha Jung.

394
00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.401
How could you do that?

395
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:02.271
You pushed your friend out of her job...

396
00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:04.606
and even demanded settlement money from her.

397
00:22:04.707 --> 00:22:07.209
Just be grateful that you didn't die that day.

398
00:22:16.685 --> 00:22:17.953
Myung Shin!

399
00:22:18.687 --> 00:22:21.457
I won't ask my dad to help you find a job.

400
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.429
She was holding her breath to flatten her stomach.

401
00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:03.031
- Yes. - Even her face was red.

402
00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:05.968
I bet Ha Jung's neck is all twisted now.

403
00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:07.469
She probably got a herniated disc.

404
00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:11.006
She kept turning around and looking at us.

405
00:23:12.174 --> 00:23:13.475
Enough already.

406
00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:16.111
Had I known, I would've taught her a lesson.

407
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:18.247
How could she steal a friend's job?

408
00:23:18.947 --> 00:23:21.517
Ji An, are you okay?

409
00:23:21.517 --> 00:23:22.785
About what?

410
00:23:24.019 --> 00:23:26.622
- Yes, I'm fine. - How can you be fine?

411
00:23:26.622 --> 00:23:29.491
You lost your job and a friend.

412
00:23:31.026 --> 00:23:32.094
You're right.

413
00:23:39.768 --> 00:23:43.038
You can move tomorrow. Come home and pack up.

414
00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:46.175
- Oh, Su Kyung! - Girls!

415
00:23:46.442 --> 00:23:49.178
- It's been so long! - You became beautiful.

416
00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:51.480
- How have you been? - Good. You look amazing.

417
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.515
What have you been up to? What about you?

418
00:24:12.734 --> 00:24:15.037
Oh, isn't that your sister?

419
00:24:15.237 --> 00:24:16.238
Yes.

420
00:24:18.907 --> 00:24:20.709
No, it's not.

421
00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:23.545
It is her. I saw her at the bank.

422
00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:26.949
- Let's go. - Why are we leaving?

423
00:24:27.416 --> 00:24:28.517
You won't say hi to her?

424
00:24:28.817 --> 00:24:30.185
There's no need.

425
00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.163
You said you're hungry. Why don't you want to eat?

426
00:24:41.463 --> 00:24:42.631
Hey, Ji Tae.

427
00:24:43.031 --> 00:24:44.399
What are we?

428
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.668
Hey, you're going too far.

429
00:24:46.668 --> 00:24:48.837
It has nothing to do with not saying hi to Ji An.

430
00:24:50.539 --> 00:24:51.874
Am I a cockroach?

431
00:24:52.441 --> 00:24:54.076
Are we two cockroaches?

432
00:24:54.376 --> 00:24:57.446
Did we decide to date secretly or what?

433
00:24:57.779 --> 00:25:00.382
Can't I even meet your family?

434
00:25:00.449 --> 00:25:01.717
Did we do something wrong?

435
00:25:01.717 --> 00:25:03.919
There's no need because we're only dating.

436
00:25:04.386 --> 00:25:05.687
Dating is only between us.

437
00:25:05.854 --> 00:25:07.756
Marriage is what involves our families.

438
00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:10.359
We won't get married. Why would you meet my family?

439
00:25:10.592 --> 00:25:13.228
And we said we'd never fight about these things.

440
00:25:13.962 --> 00:25:15.230
Don't you remember?

441
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.967
You sure keep your words.

442
00:25:18.967 --> 00:25:20.736
I'm a man of my word.

443
00:25:21.103 --> 00:25:22.104
Ji Tae.

444
00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:25.007
You said you'd never get married, right?

445
00:25:26.241 --> 00:25:27.242
Yes.

446
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:29.711
You're sure, right?

447
00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:31.880
You're asking me that after four years with me?

448
00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:34.116
You've been with me for this long knowing that.

449
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:37.886
Why are you asking me about it again?

450
00:25:38.887 --> 00:25:40.856
Then I should go to Canada.

451
00:25:41.356 --> 00:25:44.726
My mom wants to introduce me to a guy at her church.

452
00:25:47.896 --> 00:25:48.897
Go ahead.

453
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:51.466
I may not come back if I like him.

454
00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:53.669
Will you let me know that you won't be coming back?

455
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.276
- Why are you so angry? - You're such a jerk.

456
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.947
I know that we've decided not to get married,

457
00:26:05.113 --> 00:26:08.216
but you should do all other things for me, jerk.

458
00:26:08.517 --> 00:26:09.952
Like what?

459
00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:12.487
Being jealous.

460
00:26:13.922 --> 00:26:17.092
You used to say you like how inattentive I am.

461
00:26:21.363 --> 00:26:22.698
Next news.

462
00:26:23.165 --> 00:26:26.068
A job seeker in her 20s who borrowed money...

463
00:26:26.068 --> 00:26:29.771
from a loan shark took her own life.

464
00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:32.007
Ms. Han, a college student...

465
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.477
borrowed 4,000 dollars from moneylender Mr. Ko.

466
00:26:35.477 --> 00:26:37.713
But she couldn't pay the interests.

467
00:26:37.913 --> 00:26:41.550
Police found out that he even forced her...

468
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:44.086
to work at a bar in Sinsa-dong, Gangnam-gu.

469
00:26:47.456 --> 00:26:50.125
- Gosh, it hurts. - Police are...

470
00:26:50.459 --> 00:26:52.160
Gosh, seriously.

471
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.432

(Franchisee Yang Mi Jung)

473
00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:17.486
Fill out the forms and send them to us.

474
00:27:17.486 --> 00:27:19.521
Our business development team will contact you.

475
00:27:20.088 --> 00:27:22.357
We were going to open a corporate store there,

476
00:27:22.357 --> 00:27:23.625
so the location is good.

477
00:27:27.262 --> 00:27:28.797
I'm home.

478
00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:32.701
Oh, you're back.

479
00:27:33.635 --> 00:27:35.237
Where's Dad?

480
00:27:36.038 --> 00:27:37.439
He's not back yet.

481
00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:41.209
Let's sit down.

482
00:27:51.486 --> 00:27:53.722
They say you should move right in...

483
00:27:54.122 --> 00:27:55.390
since tomorrow is Sunday.

484
00:27:56.692 --> 00:27:58.894
That's so soon.

485
00:28:00.395 --> 00:28:02.931
You'll move out anyway, so staying here longer...

486
00:28:03.699 --> 00:28:06.168
will just make you and all of us uncomfortable.

487
00:28:06.234 --> 00:28:07.636
You made the right decision.

488
00:28:09.705 --> 00:28:10.906
I'm sorry, Mom.

489
00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:15.277
Even to me,

490
00:28:16.445 --> 00:28:18.647
all of this still feels so strange and surreal.

491
00:28:19.247 --> 00:28:20.949
I know how distressed you've been.

492
00:28:23.485 --> 00:28:25.987
I'm sorry too. For forcing you to leave.

493
00:28:27.756 --> 00:28:30.258
But you leaving us doesn't change the fact...

494
00:28:30.425 --> 00:28:31.593
that me and Dad...

495
00:28:32.194 --> 00:28:33.962
are your parents.

496
00:28:34.863 --> 00:28:37.299
Of course. I know that.

497
00:28:39.101 --> 00:28:40.102
However,

498
00:28:41.236 --> 00:28:42.738
as soon as you move in there...

499
00:28:44.206 --> 00:28:45.841
ask them to send you abroad for studies.

500
00:28:47.642 --> 00:28:48.643
Studies abroad?

501
00:28:49.211 --> 00:28:50.612
Parents always end up giving in.

502
00:28:50.612 --> 00:28:53.014
Just pester them. Make sure you do that, okay?

503
00:28:53.448 --> 00:28:55.417
Go to the art school in Chicago.

504
00:28:58.086 --> 00:28:59.454
I'll think about it.

505
00:28:59.454 --> 00:29:01.289
No, you have to do it.

506
00:29:01.289 --> 00:29:02.791
It's my wish.

507
00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:04.593
That's why I'm sending you to that family.

508
00:29:05.026 --> 00:29:07.095
I want you to pursue your dreams again.

509
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.932
There's no age limit in becoming an artist.

510
00:29:10.932 --> 00:29:12.434
You can become successful anytime...

511
00:29:12.434 --> 00:29:14.336
as long as you get proper education.

512
00:29:16.738 --> 00:29:17.939
I'll visit you often.

513
00:29:20.942 --> 00:29:22.644
I won't let her visit you...

514
00:29:22.644 --> 00:29:24.546
until she turns over a new leaf.

515
00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:31.720
Don't be discouraged...

516
00:29:36.057 --> 00:29:37.292
when you go there.

517
00:29:40.262 --> 00:29:41.997
Live your life.

518
00:30:03.285 --> 00:30:05.020
("TOEIC", "Guide for Job Seekers")

519
00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:22.637
Hello.

520
00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:25.240
Hello.

521
00:30:25.373 --> 00:30:27.275
I'm a student from Youngmin University.

522
00:30:27.275 --> 00:30:29.411
The director asked me to drop off this chair.

523
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:30.912
Oh, I see.

524
00:30:31.146 --> 00:30:33.348
You can put it there. Please give me a minute.

525
00:30:33.348 --> 00:30:34.516
I'll give you coffee.

526
00:30:34.516 --> 00:30:35.550
Sure.

527
00:30:36.852 --> 00:30:38.787
Are you selling this chair?

528
00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:40.655
Yes.

529
00:30:40.755 --> 00:30:42.457
Then I'll buy it.

530
00:30:42.457 --> 00:30:43.692
How much is it?

531
00:30:43.692 --> 00:30:46.127
That's for you to decide.

532
00:30:46.695 --> 00:30:47.996
You should read this sign.

533
00:30:49.497 --> 00:30:50.632
(Furniture for sale)

534
00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:51.700
(Customers decide the price.)

535
00:30:53.435 --> 00:30:55.337
How can I decide the price?

536
00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:57.539
Sir, can you just tell me how much I should pay?

537
00:30:58.173 --> 00:30:59.641
Please don't call me like that.

538
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:01.009
If I decide the price,

539
00:31:01.009 --> 00:31:02.777
the shop director will get mad at me.

540
00:31:03.111 --> 00:31:05.180
The shop director?

541
00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.215
The shop works on DIY woodwork projects.

542
00:31:07.215 --> 00:31:08.316
I promised the director.

543
00:31:10.685 --> 00:31:11.887
Oh, there he is.

544
00:31:20.195 --> 00:31:21.229
Sir.

545
00:31:21.596 --> 00:31:24.399
She keeps asking me to decide the price for her.

546
00:31:27.435 --> 00:31:28.536
Hello.

547
00:31:29.437 --> 00:31:30.872
Please don't do that.

548
00:31:31.339 --> 00:31:33.008
Just follow the instructions on the sign.

549
00:31:34.276 --> 00:31:36.177
I'll pay 100 dollars.

550
00:31:36.511 --> 00:31:37.846
100 dollars?

551
00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:41.850
No, 200 dollars?

552
00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:46.454
I'll pay 300 dollars.

553
00:31:47.622 --> 00:31:50.492
Miss, it looks like you need some time.

554
00:31:50.492 --> 00:31:52.193
Tell us when you make up your mind.

555
00:31:52.727 --> 00:31:55.797
You can tell the cafe owner over there.

556
00:31:57.198 --> 00:31:58.266
Okay.

557
00:32:17.218 --> 00:32:18.219
Oh, boy.

558
00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:20.522
Oh, my gosh!

559
00:32:22.123 --> 00:32:23.158
You were home.

560
00:32:25.727 --> 00:32:28.396
What on earth are you doing here? Go.

561
00:32:28.396 --> 00:32:29.864
- What's the problem? - Go on.

562
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.135
- Seriously. - How did you find me?

563
00:32:34.135 --> 00:32:35.370
I thought I made it clear to you.

564
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.038
I don't want to tell you how I found you.

565
00:32:37.439 --> 00:32:38.940
You blocked my number, didn't you?

566
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.508
That's why I had to come here.

567
00:32:40.508 --> 00:32:42.143
What would you have done if I wasn't home?

568
00:32:42.143 --> 00:32:43.178
If you weren't home?

569
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:45.246
I was going to bring...

570
00:32:45.246 --> 00:32:46.848
this 20,500 dollars to your parents...

571
00:32:46.848 --> 00:32:49.050
and tell them to take good care of their daughter.

572
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.486
- What? What did you say? - I'm convinced that...

573
00:32:51.486 --> 00:32:54.255
you didn't get this money through normal means.

574
00:32:54.255 --> 00:32:55.657
- Look. - You know that I talk...

575
00:32:55.657 --> 00:32:57.158
for a long time once I start, right?

576
00:32:57.158 --> 00:32:59.227
You better wait since I started talking first.

577
00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:00.195
Don't cut me off.

578
00:33:01.496 --> 00:33:02.497
Gosh, I'm sick of this.

579
00:33:03.264 --> 00:33:05.266
I was just going to take the money,

580
00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:07.535
but I couldn't turn a blind eye knowing...

581
00:33:07.535 --> 00:33:09.437
this would ruin your life. That's why I came back.

582
00:33:09.437 --> 00:33:10.872
I must return it to you.

583
00:33:10.872 --> 00:33:12.440
- Well... - I'm not done yet.

584
00:33:13.742 --> 00:33:17.212
I'm not giving this back because it's worthless.

585
00:33:17.445 --> 00:33:19.714
I'm doing it out of noblesse oblige.

586
00:33:19.714 --> 00:33:21.216
Noblesse oblige. Got it?

587
00:33:23.685 --> 00:33:24.686
Hey, stop!

588
00:33:30.492 --> 00:33:31.593
Hey!

589
00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:33.461
Stop!

590
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.599
Gosh, this is more difficult than I thought.

591
00:34:05.193 --> 00:34:06.694
You want to catch me?

592
00:34:21.376 --> 00:34:22.977
You took so long.

593
00:34:23.445 --> 00:34:26.114
- How did you beat me? - I took a shortcut.

594
00:34:26.114 --> 00:34:27.382
I live in this neighborhood.

595
00:34:30.218 --> 00:34:31.419
- Gosh. - Watch out.

596
00:34:34.923 --> 00:34:37.092
Unless you're willing to tell me where it's from,

597
00:34:37.092 --> 00:34:38.960
I refuse to accept that money.

598
00:34:43.631 --> 00:34:44.666
Goodness.

599
00:34:45.667 --> 00:34:46.701
This is the police, right?

600
00:34:48.036 --> 00:34:49.971
I'm in front of Joy Church in Daebang-dong.

601
00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:51.239
Please come here as soon as possible.

602
00:34:56.111 --> 00:34:57.112
What are you doing now?

603
00:34:57.112 --> 00:34:59.380
A weird guy followed me into my house.

604
00:35:00.281 --> 00:35:02.650
I owe him 20,000 dollars.

605
00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.653
I paid him back, but he keeps refusing the money.

606
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.088
I'm really scared right now.

607
00:35:07.088 --> 00:35:10.091
Gosh, I'm taking it back. I'm taking it, okay?

608
00:35:10.091 --> 00:35:11.860
Ji An, what's going on?

609
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.129
- If he comes back... - I will not come back.

610
00:35:14.129 --> 00:35:15.130
I'll be there right now.

611
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.031
No, it's okay. You don't need to come.

612
00:35:17.031 --> 00:35:18.800
It's sorted out now. It wasn't a big deal.

613
00:35:20.635 --> 00:35:21.736
Why are you still here?

614
00:35:22.971 --> 00:35:24.405
I won't care even if...

615
00:35:24.405 --> 00:35:26.407
you have to sell organs because of this money.

616
00:35:26.407 --> 00:35:28.109
If you show up here or contact me ever again...

617
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:29.477
I will not show up or contact you.

618
00:35:29.477 --> 00:35:30.845
Never, ever!

619
00:35:30.845 --> 00:35:32.714
You'll never see me again.

620
00:35:33.281 --> 00:35:35.383
I'm so sick of dealing with you.

621
00:35:35.517 --> 00:35:36.718
Goodbye, then.

622
00:35:38.419 --> 00:35:39.921
Goodness.

623
00:35:41.956 --> 00:35:44.492
I bet she put her parents through a lot of trouble.

624
00:35:44.826 --> 00:35:46.761
Gosh, she's so tough and stubborn.

625
00:35:46.761 --> 00:35:48.630
I really can't stand her.

626
00:35:49.797 --> 00:35:50.798
Wait.

627
00:35:51.966 --> 00:35:53.334
What? Where did it go?

628
00:35:54.302 --> 00:35:55.336
Oh, no.

629
00:36:02.977 --> 00:36:03.945
Ji An.

630
00:36:03.945 --> 00:36:06.881
This cafe sells furniture made by students...

631
00:36:06.881 --> 00:36:08.550
studying furniture woodworking in college.

632
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.084
The people who want to buy the furniture pieces...

633
00:36:10.084 --> 00:36:12.554
have to decide the price they want to pay.

634
00:36:12.554 --> 00:36:14.689
This chair is all handmade.

635
00:36:14.689 --> 00:36:16.558
I looked it up on the internet,

636
00:36:16.558 --> 00:36:18.626
and the prices vary so much.

637
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.962
If I don't want to look clueless,

638
00:36:20.962 --> 00:36:22.197
how much should I say?

639
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.665
Oh, one more thing.

640
00:36:23.665 --> 00:36:26.668
Mr. Sun doesn't work at an interior design company.

641
00:36:26.668 --> 00:36:28.836
He has an online shop for DIY furniture.

642
00:36:30.505 --> 00:36:33.841
You're not my sister anymore. I'm serious.

643
00:36:37.612 --> 00:36:39.647
She's such a bad girl.

644
00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:47.689
(Hyuk)

645
00:36:49.257 --> 00:36:51.759
I'm sorry, Hyuk. I forgot to call you back.

646
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:54.462
What?

647
00:36:54.462 --> 00:36:56.130
I'm on the way to your house.

648
00:36:56.531 --> 00:36:59.467
You don't need to come. It was nothing.

649
00:37:00.034 --> 00:37:01.536
I was just putting up a show.

650
00:37:01.536 --> 00:37:03.071
I couldn't really call the police.

651
00:37:03.071 --> 00:37:05.673
I'm coming to your neighborhood. Hang on.

652
00:37:25.126 --> 00:37:26.127
A 50-cent coin?

653
00:38:12.907 --> 00:38:14.075
(Contact list)

654
00:38:14.108 --> 00:38:15.677
(Dad)

655
00:38:54.816 --> 00:38:56.050
Ji An would...

656
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.720
never go just to become rich.

657
00:38:59.387 --> 00:39:00.955
You said you scared her.

658
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:03.725
You said those people would make us pay...

659
00:39:03.725 --> 00:39:05.360
for not telling the police that we found her.

660
00:39:06.227 --> 00:39:07.895
That's why she said she'd go.

661
00:39:11.666 --> 00:39:12.667
I heard...

662
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:16.971
you're a day laborer.

663
00:39:19.674 --> 00:39:23.111
You make 1,500 dollars a month by manual labor...

664
00:39:23.778 --> 00:39:26.214
while pretending to work at a distribution center.

665
00:39:30.551 --> 00:39:33.321
What on earth can you do for Ji An?

666
00:39:35.923 --> 00:39:38.993
So did I ever let my family starve?

667
00:39:41.596 --> 00:39:44.132
I'm the only one who's fine just by not starving.

668
00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:45.800
And I'm just barely holding it together.

669
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.237
I may be okay, but Ji An is not.

670
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.440
What Ji An really needs is not three meals a day.

671
00:39:52.573 --> 00:39:54.375
But we can't just steal from someone else.

672
00:39:54.375 --> 00:39:56.077
This is theft.

673
00:39:56.077 --> 00:39:58.146
It's us who's doing this. It's just you and me.

674
00:39:59.447 --> 00:40:02.216
Why wouldn't I do that to make my child happy?

675
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:04.986
If I get caught, I'll go to jail.

676
00:40:05.219 --> 00:40:08.089
We only need to stay silent. How hard is that?

677
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.192
What? Conscience?

678
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.396
How much is it? How much does it cost to keep it?

679
00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:17.532
For me, it's worthless!

680
00:40:20.034 --> 00:40:22.336
I shouldn't have told you the truth.

681
00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:25.006
I should've told you after Ji An left.

682
00:40:26.607 --> 00:40:28.976
I trust Ji An.

683
00:40:29.343 --> 00:40:30.511
I trust my daughter.

684
00:40:34.615 --> 00:40:35.917
Must you...

685
00:40:37.919 --> 00:40:39.153
have it your way?

686
00:40:41.055 --> 00:40:42.323
Must you really do that?

687
00:40:48.896 --> 00:40:50.097
Have it your way.

688
00:40:51.766 --> 00:40:53.568
But if you stop her from leaving,

689
00:40:54.068 --> 00:40:55.436
you and I are finished.

690
00:40:55.937 --> 00:40:57.505
I'll leave this house!

691
00:41:46.587 --> 00:41:47.688
Then...

692
00:41:48.322 --> 00:41:49.357
please be in good health.

693
00:41:52.126 --> 00:41:53.628
Message recorded.

694
00:41:53.694 --> 00:41:55.796
(Dad)

695
00:42:10.278 --> 00:42:13.447
Every alley looks just the same.

696
00:42:14.315 --> 00:42:16.450
What on earth are you doing here? Go.

697
00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:18.486
- What's the problem? - Go on!

698
00:42:20.988 --> 00:42:23.491
I must've dropped it there.

699
00:42:23.758 --> 00:42:25.026
Never, ever!

700
00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:26.861
You'll never see me again.

701
00:42:27.028 --> 00:42:30.698
Gosh, that's it. I'll just call for service.

702
00:42:30.898 --> 00:42:33.134
Gosh, what's this? Oh, my goodness!

703
00:42:34.569 --> 00:42:37.338
What? I stepped on dog poop. Really?

704
00:42:37.338 --> 00:42:38.573
Unbelievable.

705
00:42:45.379 --> 00:42:46.714
Seriously.

706
00:42:47.815 --> 00:42:49.050
I should call the service center.

707
00:42:51.586 --> 00:42:53.321
What? Where's my phone?

708
00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.959
I just can't believe this.

709
00:42:58.693 --> 00:43:00.361
My goodness.

710
00:43:07.435 --> 00:43:10.338
I've tried to think that you'd have a reason.

711
00:43:10.338 --> 00:43:11.706
But I can't wait anymore.

712
00:43:12.406 --> 00:43:13.741
I know you're going through something.

713
00:43:13.874 --> 00:43:16.377
It's not a big deal. And it's already over.

714
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.613
You heard that. He said he'd never come back.

715
00:43:18.613 --> 00:43:21.315
You talked about 20,000 dollars. What is it about?

716
00:43:22.049 --> 00:43:23.951
- Hyuk. - Tell me, or don't leave.

717
00:43:24.285 --> 00:43:26.220
Don't even try to say that I don't need to know.

718
00:43:30.358 --> 00:43:32.860
The day we met each other again.

719
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.528
I had an accident that day.

720
00:43:37.865 --> 00:43:39.567
You wouldn't understand.

721
00:43:41.535 --> 00:43:43.738
But I felt like I'd die...

722
00:43:45.339 --> 00:43:46.841
if I didn't give him the money.

723
00:43:49.076 --> 00:43:50.478
And where did you get the money?

724
00:43:52.346 --> 00:43:53.948
I borrowed the money from someone.

725
00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:55.816
Who would lend you that much money?

726
00:43:56.117 --> 00:43:57.418
I think that's enough.

727
00:43:57.718 --> 00:43:59.987
It's not dangerous. Don't worry.

728
00:44:03.958 --> 00:44:05.259
Why didn't you tell me?

729
00:44:07.128 --> 00:44:08.896
Why would I tell you about that?

730
00:44:10.765 --> 00:44:11.799
Sunwoo Hyuk.

731
00:44:12.366 --> 00:44:14.068
Why do you care so much?

732
00:44:15.236 --> 00:44:16.837
Do I look so miserable?

733
00:44:17.605 --> 00:44:18.706
Why do you think...

734
00:44:19.607 --> 00:44:21.108
I'm doing this for you?

735
00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:22.877
What?

736
00:44:26.013 --> 00:44:28.015
Why do you think I care about you so much?

737
00:44:28.716 --> 00:44:30.418
Hey, stop it.

738
00:44:33.387 --> 00:44:35.056
You were acting too odd.

739
00:44:35.056 --> 00:44:36.590
You were acting too odd to ignore.

740
00:44:37.258 --> 00:44:40.327
You sounded like you were in big trouble.

741
00:44:42.963 --> 00:44:44.899
Is that why you came all the way here?

742
00:44:59.947 --> 00:45:01.649
That may be a reason,

743
00:45:03.818 --> 00:45:05.386
but it's not the only reason.

744
00:45:16.297 --> 00:45:18.766
This is the worst day of my life.

745
00:45:29.777 --> 00:45:31.612
Can I use your phone?

746
00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:33.547
What are you talking about?

747
00:45:37.151 --> 00:45:38.552
Hey.

748
00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:40.988
Can I use your phone?

749
00:45:41.188 --> 00:45:43.491
I'll pay you. Can I make one phone call?

750
00:45:43.491 --> 00:45:46.994
What if you run away with my phone?

751
00:45:48.896 --> 00:45:50.397
Run away?

752
00:45:50.898 --> 00:45:52.466
Gosh, the people are getting hard-hearted.

753
00:45:52.466 --> 00:45:53.901
A cellphone doesn't cost that much.

754
00:46:05.146 --> 00:46:07.148
Hey, Mr. Old Friend.

755
00:46:07.715 --> 00:46:10.217
Take that call. It's getting on my nerves.

756
00:46:10.551 --> 00:46:12.686
But I felt like I'd die...

757
00:46:13.721 --> 00:46:15.256
if I didn't give him the money.

758
00:46:21.896 --> 00:46:23.130
Excuse me.

759
00:46:27.568 --> 00:46:29.036
Well...

760
00:46:29.036 --> 00:46:30.971
Can I borrow your phone?

761
00:46:31.005 --> 00:46:32.473
That's my car,

762
00:46:32.473 --> 00:46:34.508
and my phone's locked inside.

763
00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:37.444
Can't you open a door?

764
00:46:37.945 --> 00:46:40.047
If it's your car, get your phone.

765
00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:43.150
Well, I lost my car keys too.

766
00:46:43.984 --> 00:46:46.153
Why should I lend you my phone?

767
00:46:47.488 --> 00:46:49.857
To open the car door,

768
00:46:49.857 --> 00:46:51.992
I need to call the insurance company.

769
00:46:53.093 --> 00:46:54.395
You have a lot of money.

770
00:46:54.395 --> 00:46:56.030
You could buy another key.

771
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:57.131
What?

772
00:46:57.131 --> 00:47:00.401
No. You could break a window and get in...

773
00:47:00.401 --> 00:47:01.669
since you're rich.

774
00:47:07.608 --> 00:47:09.977
Your insurance should cover it. Don't argue.

775
00:47:10.878 --> 00:47:13.347
You're blocking a road during rush hour,

776
00:47:13.347 --> 00:47:14.882
and you look too nice.

777
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:18.219
I think we met before.

778
00:47:22.489 --> 00:47:24.859
We did meet before.

779
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.108
She had a boyfriend.

780
00:47:41.775 --> 00:47:44.778
Shall I lend you my phone?

781
00:47:45.779 --> 00:47:47.047
No thanks.

782
00:47:57.958 --> 00:48:00.361
Did you give her the 20,000 dollars?

783
00:48:00.527 --> 00:48:01.762
Unbelievable.

784
00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:03.697
Tell me where you got this money.

785
00:48:03.697 --> 00:48:05.199
I'll only accept it then.

786
00:48:05.199 --> 00:48:06.467
Why would I tell you that?

787
00:48:06.467 --> 00:48:07.835
A loan, organ donation,

788
00:48:07.835 --> 00:48:10.170
or working at a bar. It's none of your concern.

789
00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.238
Wait.

790
00:48:11.672 --> 00:48:13.507
Did she not tell me on purpose?

791
00:48:14.208 --> 00:48:17.278
Did she just make fun of me?

792
00:48:30.257 --> 00:48:31.358
Hello.

793
00:48:31.625 --> 00:48:32.993
You're leaving tomorrow?

794
00:48:32.993 --> 00:48:34.895
Call me if something comes up.

795
00:48:35.863 --> 00:48:38.032
Who do you expect to clean that up?

796
00:48:38.799 --> 00:48:40.534
I'll come home every other day.

797
00:48:41.335 --> 00:48:42.336
"Home"?

798
00:48:42.736 --> 00:48:45.339
Seo Ji An, you only have one home.

799
00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:46.740
Just one home.

800
00:48:47.107 --> 00:48:49.677
I have to think of the parents who lost me.

801
00:48:50.244 --> 00:48:51.946
Say you're going for the money.

802
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.448
If I say that,

803
00:48:54.715 --> 00:48:56.283
will you feel better?

804
00:48:57.418 --> 00:48:59.420
I thought about what you said.

805
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.855
You had a hard time because of me.

806
00:49:02.356 --> 00:49:03.490
Was it just me?

807
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:05.125
There's Ji Ho too.

808
00:49:05.225 --> 00:49:06.694
You gave him an allowance...

809
00:49:06.694 --> 00:49:08.195
after he went back to college.

810
00:49:08.295 --> 00:49:09.997
You must've felt so wronged.

811
00:49:11.398 --> 00:49:14.902
But guess what? No one told you to do that.

812
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:17.037
You did it yourself.

813
00:49:17.905 --> 00:49:19.340
Stop it, Ji Soo.

814
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.575
You're not usually like this.

815
00:49:21.575 --> 00:49:23.477
You'll regret saying that after I leave.

816
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:25.112
Why would I regret?

817
00:49:25.245 --> 00:49:26.714
I said we're over if you leave,

818
00:49:26.714 --> 00:49:28.148
and you're packing your things.

819
00:49:28.215 --> 00:49:29.917
It's over between us.

820
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:32.486
What I can't forgive is that...

821
00:49:33.053 --> 00:49:34.855
you're going when you don't have to.

822
00:49:34.855 --> 00:49:36.957
If your parents are so rich,

823
00:49:36.957 --> 00:49:39.727
they won't let you search for a job.

824
00:49:39.727 --> 00:49:41.295
Even if you want them to,

825
00:49:41.295 --> 00:49:43.530
would they let you after they get you back?

826
00:49:44.565 --> 00:49:45.966
And you're still going.

827
00:49:47.134 --> 00:49:50.237
That's why you're no longer my sister.

828
00:49:51.805 --> 00:49:52.840
I am.

829
00:49:52.906 --> 00:49:54.575
- You're not. - I am.

830
00:49:54.575 --> 00:49:55.609
You are not!

831
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:56.710
Ji An...

832
00:49:57.011 --> 00:49:58.145
My goodness.

833
00:49:58.545 --> 00:50:00.714
Are you two fighting?

834
00:50:00.848 --> 00:50:02.016
You're home early.

835
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.052
I heard you're leaving tomorrow.

836
00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:08.255
Ji Tae's home too. He wants to have a beer.

837
00:50:08.989 --> 00:50:09.990
I'm not going.

838
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.827
Let's go.

839
00:50:14.028 --> 00:50:15.629
Ji Soo, won't you...

840
00:50:31.879 --> 00:50:34.281
What are your plans once you move in?

841
00:50:34.915 --> 00:50:37.885
You won't have to go back to work at Haesung.

842
00:50:39.553 --> 00:50:41.989
I haven't thought about that yet.

843
00:50:42.756 --> 00:50:44.525
It's all so sudden.

844
00:50:46.026 --> 00:50:47.528
I hope you study abroad.

845
00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:51.265
It's your chance to resume dreaming again.

846
00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:56.170
Mom said that and now you too?

847
00:50:57.171 --> 00:51:00.107
I'd never thought about it since I'd given up art.

848
00:51:01.575 --> 00:51:03.243
Ji Tae, I think...

849
00:51:05.345 --> 00:51:08.515
I'd forgotten about it for so long.

850
00:51:10.317 --> 00:51:12.419
It doesn't feel real at all.

851
00:51:15.255 --> 00:51:18.025
But if I can do it,

852
00:51:19.626 --> 00:51:20.727
I want to.

853
00:51:21.595 --> 00:51:23.097
It's not an "if".

854
00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:25.632
You can do anything you want.

855
00:51:25.799 --> 00:51:26.967
You're rich now.

856
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:30.337
Had I known,

857
00:51:31.472 --> 00:51:33.107
I'd have been nicer to you.

858
00:51:35.175 --> 00:51:38.278
Will you stop it? I'll come home often.

859
00:51:39.012 --> 00:51:40.047
I was...

860
00:51:41.148 --> 00:51:42.716
too busy with my own life.

861
00:51:43.817 --> 00:51:45.686
I thought we should care for ourselves.

862
00:51:46.987 --> 00:51:48.355
I ignored everyone else.

863
00:51:50.924 --> 00:51:52.025
Ji An.

864
00:51:55.262 --> 00:51:57.698
Don't forget about us.

865
00:52:11.745 --> 00:52:12.880
Ji An.

866
00:52:15.282 --> 00:52:17.818
I'm so sorry, Ji Ho.

867
00:52:18.185 --> 00:52:20.087
You too, Ji Tae.

868
00:52:21.555 --> 00:52:23.157
I'm so sorry for...

869
00:52:24.491 --> 00:52:27.628
I'm sorry for saying I'd leave so soon.

870
00:52:30.998 --> 00:52:33.467
I'm leaving you for a better life.

871
00:52:33.867 --> 00:52:35.736
I'm leaving you behind.

872
00:52:37.237 --> 00:52:39.206
I really wasn't going to go.

873
00:52:40.107 --> 00:52:42.276
I really wasn't going to go.

874
00:52:46.213 --> 00:52:48.649
I'm so sorry.

875
00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:53.086
Don't cry, Ji An.

876
00:52:53.987 --> 00:52:55.189
Don't cry.

877
00:52:57.524 --> 00:52:59.026
Who cares if you're leaving?

878
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.628
I would if I were you.

879
00:53:03.597 --> 00:53:04.965
Our mom.

880
00:53:05.799 --> 00:53:07.968
Our dad.

881
00:53:09.236 --> 00:53:11.505
Dad isn't answering his phone.

882
00:53:13.974 --> 00:53:17.110
Dad isn't answering his phone.

883
00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.168
Ji Soo, have breakfast.

884
00:54:15.168 --> 00:54:16.336
I'm not hungry.

885
00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:17.571
Where are you going?

886
00:54:17.938 --> 00:54:19.806
Don't you know I work on Sundays too?

887
00:54:19.806 --> 00:54:21.208
Ji Soo.

888
00:54:21.208 --> 00:54:23.577
This is very unexpected.

889
00:54:24.344 --> 00:54:27.514
Here's your favorite. Sausages.

890
00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:29.650
Do you think I'm a starved baby?

891
00:54:30.417 --> 00:54:31.718
Watch yourselves.

892
00:54:32.986 --> 00:54:34.655
Leave her alone.

893
00:54:35.489 --> 00:54:36.957
She's so serious.

894
00:54:36.957 --> 00:54:40.260
The real issue is that we don't take her seriously.

895
00:54:40.594 --> 00:54:42.262
I say she won't last a week.

896
00:54:43.997 --> 00:54:45.299
So do I.

897
00:54:45.299 --> 00:54:46.366
All right.

898
00:55:14.328 --> 00:55:15.696
Dad, Dad.

899
00:55:15.696 --> 00:55:17.197
- Dad! - Run.

900
00:55:17.397 --> 00:55:18.665
- Dad! - An and Soo.

901
00:55:18.665 --> 00:55:20.667
- Dad! - Oh, dear.

902
00:55:20.667 --> 00:55:21.835
Hello, hello.

903
00:55:22.235 --> 00:55:24.071
Dad, this is you.

904
00:55:24.071 --> 00:55:26.440
Doesn't it look exactly like you?

905
00:55:26.807 --> 00:55:28.508
Did you carve this?

906
00:55:28.709 --> 00:55:30.777
With the German carving knives you got me.

907
00:55:30.777 --> 00:55:32.379
They're really sharp.

908
00:55:33.046 --> 00:55:35.716
We ran freaking hard to get home before you.

909
00:55:35.816 --> 00:55:37.050
"Freaking"?

910
00:55:37.484 --> 00:55:39.986
Why are you out here instead of coming in?

911
00:55:39.986 --> 00:55:41.588
Dad's tired.

912
00:55:41.588 --> 00:55:43.190
Come inside, honey.

913
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.402
That looks so good.

914
00:55:58.739 --> 00:56:01.108
If only Ji Tae were here with us.

915
00:56:01.608 --> 00:56:03.977
No way. Soldier boy eats too much.

916
00:56:03.977 --> 00:56:06.146
He eats even before the meat's ready.

917
00:56:06.947 --> 00:56:08.715
Honey, open your present.

918
00:56:11.918 --> 00:56:13.653
Darling.

919
00:56:13.653 --> 00:56:17.257
These are emeralds. I wanted sapphires.

920
00:56:17.424 --> 00:56:20.961
You said Columbia produces the most emeralds.

921
00:56:20.961 --> 00:56:22.696
I thought that's what you wanted.

922
00:56:22.696 --> 00:56:26.066
I have two emerald necklace and ring sets.

923
00:56:31.505 --> 00:56:32.839
Ji An, Ji Soo.

924
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:36.777
Can you carry one each?

925
00:56:36.777 --> 00:56:38.779
How dare you ask your sisters?

926
00:56:39.279 --> 00:56:41.415
Can't a soldier carry his own bags?

927
00:56:42.215 --> 00:56:44.317
It's unfair that we have to serve in the military.

928
00:56:44.317 --> 00:56:45.919
Out of my way.

929
00:56:45.919 --> 00:56:47.220
Move, move.

930
00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:50.857
Honey, we should get a six-seater for us all.

931
00:56:50.857 --> 00:56:53.527
Mom, the best trips are the train kind.

932
00:56:53.527 --> 00:56:55.762
Yes, the best trips are the train kind.

933
00:56:55.762 --> 00:56:56.797
That's right.

934
00:56:57.097 --> 00:56:58.398
Mr. Seo?

935
00:56:58.398 --> 00:57:00.567
- Shall we go? - Let's go, Mr. Seo.

936
00:57:00.567 --> 00:57:03.336
Who do you take after that you're both so tall?

937
00:57:05.071 --> 00:57:08.375
It's all down to me. I fed them good food.

938
00:57:15.048 --> 00:57:16.817
- That was hard. - That was too hard.

939
00:57:16.817 --> 00:57:18.985
- Take that! - Not so hard!

940
00:57:19.186 --> 00:57:21.087
This is how you do it.

941
00:57:27.093 --> 00:57:30.497
We were like that. Those were the good days.

942
00:57:31.565 --> 00:57:33.166
We were happy then.

943
00:57:57.157 --> 00:57:59.860
This is the hottest set of our new line.

944
00:58:00.193 --> 00:58:01.228
No.

945
00:58:02.128 --> 00:58:04.531
What do you think about this?

946
00:58:04.898 --> 00:58:07.267
Have you lost your touch, Ms. Song?

947
00:58:08.468 --> 00:58:12.105
This set is a bit expensive but...

948
00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:16.376
It's a limited edition. Actress Son Ye Jin...

949
00:58:17.277 --> 00:58:18.778
Are you saying she's better than...

950
00:58:18.778 --> 00:58:21.147
whoever I'm getting this for?

951
00:58:21.648 --> 00:58:24.217
Are you seeing someone?

952
00:58:24.217 --> 00:58:25.719
That's a definite no.

953
00:58:25.719 --> 00:58:28.154
You have such a poor imagination.

954
00:58:28.355 --> 00:58:31.258
A single man shopping for a woman must be dating?

955
00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:32.526
No, no, no.

956
00:58:33.727 --> 00:58:36.396
It's not your mother's taste, so...

957
00:58:36.396 --> 00:58:38.064
A girlfriend or mother?

958
00:58:38.064 --> 00:58:40.467
Do you think a man has only two groups of women?

959
00:58:40.467 --> 00:58:43.136
That's how poor your imagination is.

960
00:58:43.336 --> 00:58:46.239
Above Son Ye Jin. Jun Ji Hyun, a mom of two.

961
00:58:46.239 --> 00:58:48.108
She's incomparable.

962
00:58:48.108 --> 00:58:50.777
This is purely a subjective view.

963
00:58:50.777 --> 00:58:53.046
I'm not at all demeaning them.

964
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.915
Of course not.

965
00:58:54.915 --> 00:58:57.684
Who on earth could this woman be?

966
00:58:58.418 --> 00:59:00.487
That's...

967
00:59:01.588 --> 00:59:02.856
a secret.

968
00:59:03.657 --> 00:59:04.991
Do you have anything else?

969
00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.462
Let me take that for you.

970
00:59:46.566 --> 00:59:48.668
Don't come out. I'll see myself off.

971
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:52.072
Would you if you were me?

972
00:59:53.506 --> 00:59:54.874
I guess not.

973
00:59:58.144 --> 00:59:59.746
Take care of yourselves.

974
01:00:00.213 --> 01:00:01.414
I'll visit often.

975
01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:05.318
Go on. They'll be waiting.

976
01:00:05.485 --> 01:00:06.686
Okay.

977
01:00:08.989 --> 01:00:10.090
Thank you.

978
01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:12.926
Nice to meet you.

979
01:00:13.326 --> 01:00:16.796
I'm General Manager Min. I work for Mr. Choi.

980
01:00:17.664 --> 01:00:19.165
I see.

981
01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:26.973
Hello. I'm Seo Ji An.

982
01:00:29.609 --> 01:00:31.511
Get in the car, miss.

983
01:00:48.194 --> 01:00:50.864
Bye, Mom. See you.

984
01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:54.267
Bye.

985
01:00:55.669 --> 01:00:57.337
Take care, Ji An.

986
01:00:58.505 --> 01:01:01.941
Take care of yourself. Call when you're there.

987
01:01:03.276 --> 01:01:04.544
See you.

988
01:01:44.184 --> 01:01:46.586
Why are you all out here?

989
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.155
Didn't you go straight to Daejeon?

990
01:01:49.255 --> 01:01:50.857
Are you here to see Ji An?

991
01:01:51.357 --> 01:01:53.026
She just left...

992
01:01:53.493 --> 01:01:54.761
in that car.

993
01:02:01.067 --> 01:02:02.569
Dad!

994
01:02:10.343 --> 01:02:11.478
Ji An!

995
01:02:12.378 --> 01:02:14.647
- Miss. - Yes?

996
01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:15.882
When you get home,

997
01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.818
don't introduce yourself as Seo Ji An.

998
01:02:20.854 --> 01:02:22.455
Then what do I say?

999
01:02:22.689 --> 01:02:25.024
You are Choi Eun Seok now.

1000
01:02:28.094 --> 01:02:29.395
I'm not sure.

1001
01:02:33.266 --> 01:02:34.567
Ji An!

1002
01:02:35.802 --> 01:02:38.037
Drive faster. They'll be waiting.

1003
01:02:38.138 --> 01:02:39.239
Sure.

1004
01:02:40.707 --> 01:02:42.075
Ji An!

1005
01:02:42.876 --> 01:02:44.277
Ji An!

1006
01:02:52.418 --> 01:02:53.686
Ji An.

1007
01:02:56.723 --> 01:02:57.857
Ji An!

1008
01:03:07.901 --> 01:03:09.969
Ji An...

1009
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:11.738
Ji An.

1010
01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.696
There's everything she'll need for now.

1011
01:03:36.696 --> 01:03:37.797
What do you think?

1012
01:03:38.198 --> 01:03:39.399
I like everything...

1013
01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:41.467
but the curtains.

1014
01:03:43.937 --> 01:03:46.806
- What about them? - Get blackout curtains.

1015
01:03:48.007 --> 01:03:49.442
She'll have a hard time...

1016
01:03:49.442 --> 01:03:51.344
falling asleep in this unfamiliar room.

1017
01:03:51.611 --> 01:03:54.380
Why? The mattress is fine and the bedding...

1018
01:03:56.149 --> 01:03:58.318
Oh, I see what you mean.

1019
01:03:59.319 --> 01:04:02.255
I saw her bedroom when I was there.

1020
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.524
I can't believe two girls shared it.

1021
01:04:05.358 --> 01:04:07.760
This room could feel dauntingly big.

1022
01:04:20.773 --> 01:04:22.108
We're here.

1023
01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:24.177
Okay.

1024
01:04:29.816 --> 01:04:31.317
Thank you.

1025
01:04:32.585 --> 01:04:33.920
Leave it.

1026
01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.989
Mr. Myung will bring them in.

1027
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:38.958
Oh, okay...

1028
01:04:42.896 --> 01:04:44.264
Mom, Dad.

1029
01:04:44.497 --> 01:04:46.799
I got a present for Eun Seok.

1030
01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.802
What did you get?

1031
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:52.005
I wasn't sure what she likes.

1032
01:04:52.005 --> 01:04:54.340
I got scented candles and incense for her room.

1033
01:04:54.507 --> 01:04:55.875
Well done.

1034
01:04:59.212 --> 01:05:00.380
Dad.

1035
01:05:00.914 --> 01:05:03.416
Yes. Well done.

1036
01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:08.154
I'm seeing a sister I've never met before,

1037
01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:09.689
so I'm really nervous.

1038
01:05:10.056 --> 01:05:12.759
Why are you two so tense?

1039
01:05:12.759 --> 01:05:15.028
What's taking her so long to get here?

1040
01:05:52.799 --> 01:05:53.967
Stop right there.

1041
01:06:07.013 --> 01:06:09.816
What are you doing in my house?

1042
01:06:11.484 --> 01:06:12.919
"My house"?

1043
01:06:46.052 --> 01:06:48.488
(My Golden Life)

1044
01:06:49.689 --> 01:06:51.257
This is horrible.

1045
01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.692
Introduce yourselves.

1046
01:06:52.692 --> 01:06:54.293
I'm Choi Do Kyung. Never mind.

1047
01:06:54.293 --> 01:06:55.995
Welcome back.

1048
01:06:55.995 --> 01:06:57.397
I'm your brother.

1049
01:06:57.397 --> 01:06:58.965
I shouldn't have come.

1050
01:06:58.965 --> 01:07:02.168
Dad, I'll treat you nicely instead of Ji An.

1051
01:07:02.168 --> 01:07:03.836
I'm your real daughter.

1052
01:07:03.836 --> 01:07:05.738
I'm your read daughter.

1053
01:07:05.905 --> 01:07:07.940
Dad collapsed while chasing after you.

1054
01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:10.109
He was following your car, but you ignored him.

1055
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:11.511
Hey, Seo Ji An.

1056
01:07:11.511 --> 01:07:14.647
Do I have to earn your trust if I'm from outside?

1057
01:07:14.647 --> 01:07:15.715
Of course.

1058
01:07:16.315 --> 01:07:17.383
It's fine.

1059
01:07:17.383 --> 01:07:18.651
It's hard to be your brother.

1060
01:07:18.651 --> 01:07:20.887
You don't have to do this.

1061
01:07:20.887 --> 01:07:22.355
Who do you think I am?

1062
01:07:22.355 --> 01:07:23.356
What?
