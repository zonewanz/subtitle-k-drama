00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:15.572
Ms. Sa Jin Jin!

3
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.811
Ms. Sa, you're in there, aren't you?

4
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:24.311
Ms. Sa, we just have a few questions.

5
00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:25.982
Ms. Sa.

6
00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:28.982
Please open up. We just want to ask a few questions.

7
00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:30.151
She's not in?

8
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:33.392
No, I think she's inside.

9
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.822
But she's not letting us in.

10
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.291
Ms. Sa, please open up!

11
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:39.431
Ms. Sa, aren't you home?

12
00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:44.002
We know you're in there!

13
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:49.102
- Ms. Sa! - Ms. Sa!

14
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:50.941
Please open up!

15
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:52.842
Please spare us a few minutes!

16
00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:55.011
We'll be on our way after we ask a few questions.

17
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:57.712
- It won't hurt you. Please open up! - Ms. Sa!

18
00:00:57.712 --> 00:00:59.712
It will only take a few minutes.

19
00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:01.952
Ms. Sa, please open the door.

20
00:01:01.952 --> 00:01:03.922
This will only take a few seconds.

21
00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:06.152
Please let us in. We just want to ask a few questions.

22
00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:07.152
Excuse me.

23
00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:09.122
We know you're in there.

24
00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:11.191
Please open the door.

The fried chicken.

26
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:18.631
Let us ask a few questions, and we'll be out of your hair.

27
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:22.441
How much is this?

28
00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:39.821
Ms. Sa!

29
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:43.392
- We're not strangers. Open up. - Please hold on.

30
00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:47.361
Please just spare us a few questions!

31
00:01:48.202 --> 00:01:49.631
You're in there, aren't you?

32
00:01:50.032 --> 00:01:51.301
Look here.

33
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:53.202
Who are you?

34
00:01:53.202 --> 00:01:55.601
- We are reporters. -That doesn't give you the right!

35
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.471
Who are you to disrupt the peace?

36
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.441
Before I report you for trespassing and file a noise complaint,

37
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:02.482
you'd better leave!

38
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.551
- I'm sorry. When we... - Stop it. Leave now!

39
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:06.182
I don't want to hear it. Just get out!

40
00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:08.682
- How could you be so rude? - We're sorry.

41
00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:10.152
Get out right now!

42
00:02:11.092 --> 00:02:12.451
But I think she's here.

43
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.421
- Ms. Sa! - Ms. Sa! Just...

44
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:16.492
- Ms. Sa! - Ms. Sa!

45
00:02:16.492 --> 00:02:17.891
I told you to leave!

46
00:02:18.062 --> 00:02:19.631
You're not going to leave?

47
00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:30.941
Excuse me.

48
00:02:34.782 --> 00:02:35.842
Here.

50
00:02:52.032 --> 00:02:53.161
Are you busy?

51
00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:54.832
A bit.

52
00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:59.002
This is bad. Jin Jin is getting tons of hate comments.

53
00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:00.272
It's crawling with haters online.

54
00:03:01.471 --> 00:03:04.071
- Really? - Should we pay her a visit?

55
00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:06.411
I don't think she can get any sleep.

56
00:03:12.252 --> 00:03:15.381
It's a report about the investment. Please have a positive mindset.

Let's take our time. Let us.

59
00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:39.242
Please edit this part out. This can't air.

60
00:03:39.842 --> 00:03:44.252
Please delete the whole footage. If it leaks, she'll be in trouble.

61
00:03:44.252 --> 00:03:46.511
I'm sorry. Please. I'm begging you.

62
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.522
Gosh, you startled me.

63
00:03:52.221 --> 00:03:54.092
You wanted me to get rid of the footage before.

64
00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:56.191
I don't have it. I deleted it right away.

65
00:03:56.191 --> 00:03:58.992
Please. Could you look for it one more time?

66
00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:01.701
Please, I'm begging you.

67
00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:03.302
I told you I don't have it.

68
00:04:03.962 --> 00:04:07.272
You know that we can't air our show in Hong Kong, don't you?

70
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:12.571
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:14.282 --> 00:04:16.381
This is karma catching up.

72
00:04:17.912 --> 00:04:19.781
Goodness.

73
00:04:21.182 --> 00:04:23.881
- Do you not drink? - I like drinking.

74
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:27.591
You're probably harder on yourself at a time like this.

75
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.862
It comes naturally at your age.

76
00:04:30.932 --> 00:04:33.062
You remind me of President Sung when he was young.

77
00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:36.701
That's an old story. He's grown quite old.

78
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.901
He says he's lonely and that he wants to date.

79
00:04:38.901 --> 00:04:40.302
Dating is nice.

80
00:04:41.502 --> 00:04:43.071
I saw the news,

81
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:45.612
and I think we might have someone suitable for our needs soon.

82
00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:47.742
- Who? - Her name is Sa Jin Jin.

83
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:50.742
Right. She's very sexy.

84
00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:53.182
She's been on her high horse for all this time.

85
00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:56.951
Do you think her starting fee would be about 30,000 dollars?

86
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:59.321
That's quite affordable.

87
00:04:59.552 --> 00:05:02.391
- Should I ask around? - Yes, please!

88
00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:05.461
Sir.

89
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:08.002
What? You want in on this too?

90
00:05:09.562 --> 00:05:10.872
What a man.

91
00:05:12.872 --> 00:05:13.872
Please...

92
00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:16.401
excuse me.

93
00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:24.042
- What is it? - President Gong.

94
00:05:24.252 --> 00:05:26.151
What's the matter with him?

95
00:05:34.722 --> 00:05:38.062
I'd like to take back my offer for the takeover...

96
00:05:38.362 --> 00:05:40.031
of National Chemicals.

97
00:05:52.312 --> 00:05:53.472
What's going on?

98
00:05:55.412 --> 00:05:56.812
I think she's sleeping.

99
00:05:57.612 --> 00:06:00.281
- We shouldn't have come. - Come on. Quiet.

100
00:06:07.722 --> 00:06:10.891
Hey, if the hospital finds out, I'll be in big trouble. I have to...

101
00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:12.862
Keep it down. You'll wake her up.

102
00:06:13.562 --> 00:06:14.761
Gosh.

103
00:06:15.002 --> 00:06:17.102
I'll sleep here, and you should sleep over there.

104
00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:24.372
I'll just sleep on the floor. The floor is more comfortable.

105
00:06:25.972 --> 00:06:28.542
- Then take this pillow. - Okay.

106
00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:31.951
Why did you make me come here?

107
00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:34.081
Okay, okay. Just get some sleep.

108
00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:01.412
Yes!

In times of happiness or sadness, no matter what happens...

114
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:20.261
to you, Jin Jin,

115
00:07:20.562 --> 00:07:23.232
- Daddy is going to protect you. - Let's play with them!

116
00:07:23.602 --> 00:07:26.432
- Sure. I'm Papa Giraffe. - While I'm gone,

117
00:07:26.432 --> 00:07:28.441
Jin Jin, Ah Reum, and Young Shim,

118
00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:30.341
you should become giraffes...

119
00:07:30.341 --> 00:07:33.172
- and be there for each other. - 1, 2, 3.

From Dad in Libya.

121
00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:37.581
- Goodness. - What is this?

122
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:39.682
It differs by gender.

123
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:42.482
No way.

124
00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:45.622
- Since we already ate everything... - Hey, let's do it together.

125
00:07:45.622 --> 00:07:47.122
- Don't fall! - We need to exercise.

126
00:07:47.122 --> 00:07:49.162
I knew it. It would break one day.

127
00:07:49.162 --> 00:07:51.031
- We can save this! - Oh, no.

128
00:07:51.031 --> 00:07:53.961
- You look too polite. - Then you should be...

129
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:57.031
Did you see? I'm the best.

130
00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:58.672
Let's put earrings on this.

131
00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:04.542
Since we're done eating...

132
00:08:18.151 --> 00:08:19.752
Did you get some sleep?

133
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:21.591
I bet you couldn't sleep.

134
00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:24.492
Oh, my. Go home, and sleep. Come on.

135
00:08:24.492 --> 00:08:26.292
Precisely.

136
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:28.631
I couldn't sleep at all. My back hurts.

137
00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:31.701
No, you snored like crazy last night.

138
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:36.102
This is an announcement for our residents.

139

Every Wednesday is the recycling day for residents in Seoul Mansion.

140
00:08:40.842 --> 00:08:42.881
Please recycle on the scheduled days...

141
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:45.311
and make a clean environment for all of us.

142
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:49.181
Today is Wednesday?

143

(On air)

145
00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:08.742
One who doesn't give up will fulfill one's dream.

146
00:09:08.742 --> 00:09:10.811
She has finally answered our desperate prayers...

147
00:09:10.811 --> 00:09:13.011
we made every Wednesday.

148
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:16.112
Everyone, she's going to make your hearts race so fast.

149
00:09:16.112 --> 00:09:19.011
The segment, Special Date, begins now.

150
00:09:19.011 --> 00:09:21.122
Please welcome, Sa Jin Jin.

151
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:23.482
Is this really happening?

152
00:09:23.482 --> 00:09:25.622
I can't believe this is actually happening.

153
00:09:25.622 --> 00:09:28.521
- It's so nice to meet you. - Hello, I'm Sa Jin Jin.

154
00:09:28.521 --> 00:09:31.232
Sir, please turn up the volume. Hurry.

155
00:09:31.732 --> 00:09:35.161
First of all, I must've surprised you all for showing up like this.

156
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:36.261
- No. - Not at all.

157
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:40.401
I'd like to apologize for showing up unannounced like this.

158
00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:41.771
- Please don't. - No, no.

159
00:09:41.771 --> 00:09:43.002
- That's nonsense. - Are you all right?

160
00:09:43.002 --> 00:09:45.511
Every week, Master and I have been...

161
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:47.072
begging for you to star on our show.

162
00:09:47.072 --> 00:09:49.311
- You heard our shows, didn't you? - Did this patient go somewhere?

163
00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:51.252
- Of course, I did. - She went out to meet a friend.

164
00:09:51.252 --> 00:09:53.381
- But... - A friend?

165
00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:56.752
I heard that she drove here without her agent.

166
00:09:56.752 --> 00:09:58.822
- Really? - Yes.

167
00:09:59.122 --> 00:10:00.192
Hold on.

168
00:10:00.192 --> 00:10:03.192
- Don't. I'd like to listen to this. - Support of my friends helped me.

169
00:10:04.592 --> 00:10:08.301
All right. Two of your friends accompanied you to the studio.

170
00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:09.702
One of your friends...

171
00:10:09.702 --> 00:10:13.931
came straight here in her hospital gown.

172
00:10:13.931 --> 00:10:16.671
Their friendship deserves our applause.

173
00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:19.011
What an amazing friendship.

174
00:10:21.881 --> 00:10:23.842
Before we start this fan meeting,

175
00:10:23.842 --> 00:10:25.612
Jin Jin told me that there's something...

176
00:10:25.612 --> 00:10:29.352
she wanted to say through our radio show.

177
00:10:29.352 --> 00:10:31.521
- What is it about? - All right.

178
00:10:32.092 --> 00:10:35.192
I'm sure you probably saw my name in the articles for the last two days.

179
00:10:35.192 --> 00:10:36.362
Yes, we did.

180
00:10:36.362 --> 00:10:39.061
I'd like to say it's not me in the video.

181
00:10:40.232 --> 00:10:42.031
And what's more important is that...

182
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:44.671
I'm afraid the scandal might've hurt an innocent person,

183
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:46.502
and I'd like to apologize for that.

184
00:10:46.502 --> 00:10:49.901
- That's true. - What's more is that...

185
00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.472
I'd like to tell the public that women must not...

186
00:10:52.472 --> 00:10:56.181
be criticized or vilified because of a video.

187
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:59.311
- Nothing's wrong with the video. - You're right.

188
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:02.521
The one who filmed and spread the video should be the one on trial.

189
00:11:03.482 --> 00:11:07.391
To tell you the truth, I was also hurt deeply...

190
00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:09.222
by an incident which mistreated me greatly.

191
00:11:09.222 --> 00:11:11.092
Just like Jin Jin said,

192
00:11:11.092 --> 00:11:13.462
the women are always the victims.

193
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:17.771
So I plan on catching whoever spread it and punish them dearly.

194
00:11:18.732 --> 00:11:22.041
The friend who came with me is a very scary lawyer.

195
00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:24.112
- I didn't know. - Me?

196
00:11:25.472 --> 00:11:27.742
- I went to the OBGYN... - Yes?

197
00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:30.511
to visit my friend over there at the hospital.

198
00:11:30.742 --> 00:11:31.952
That's all there's to it.

199
00:11:32.381 --> 00:11:35.681
I'll sue the reporters who printed vicious articles for defamation.

200
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:38.021
I won't settle.

201
00:11:38.352 --> 00:11:41.521
This is all I wanted to say.

202
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:42.661
(Jin Jin is telling the truth!)

203
00:11:42.862 --> 00:11:46.862
I'm sorry for making this fan meeting so dull.

204
00:11:46.862 --> 00:11:49.401
- No, no. - No, that's all right.

205
00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:50.872
What should I do?

206
00:11:50.872 --> 00:11:53.531
- I prepared a special skill. - No, no.

207
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:54.742
- That's all right. - Don't do it.

208
00:11:54.742 --> 00:11:56.002
- Please calm down. - Why is she saying that?

209
00:11:56.002 --> 00:11:57.372
You have waited long for this.

210
00:11:57.372 --> 00:12:00.942
This the first meeting with Jin Jin on "Hopeful Song at Noon".

211
00:12:00.942 --> 00:12:02.342
Here it goes!

212
00:12:08.482 --> 00:12:11.391
A lot of people are...

213
00:12:11.391 --> 00:12:13.952
- rooting for Jin Jin. - What is that?

214
00:12:13.952 --> 00:12:16.421
- What is this? - We talked about something serious.

215
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:18.031
- I'd like to... - We got texts at the same time.

216
00:12:18.031 --> 00:12:19.291
- You got it too? - Yes.

217
00:12:19.291 --> 00:12:22.561
- What is this? - Our writers have been busy...

218
00:12:22.561 --> 00:12:24.671
preparing a lot of activities.

219
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:27.901
Firstly, we'd like to clear up any misunderstandings about Jin Jin.

220
00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:29.842
- Give us a round of applause. - That was in Hong Kong.

221
00:12:29.842 --> 00:12:30.872
Wasn't it?

222
00:12:30.872 --> 00:12:31.972
- Good work. - Great job.

223
00:12:31.972 --> 00:12:33.271
Good work today.

224
00:12:33.271 --> 00:12:35.482
- Jin Jin, everyone loved the show. - Thank you.

225
00:12:35.482 --> 00:12:36.811
- Please come again next time. - We'll see you again.

226
00:12:36.811 --> 00:12:38.252
Sure, invite me again next time.

227
00:12:38.252 --> 00:12:39.681
- Good work, Shin Young. - Good job.

228
00:12:39.681 --> 00:12:42.252
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

229
00:12:42.252 --> 00:12:43.551
Oh, my. Jin Jin.

230
00:12:43.551 --> 00:12:46.852
- Hey, you need to watch this. - Take a look at this.

231
00:12:48.222 --> 00:12:50.661
- This is unbelievable. - This will surprise you.

232
00:12:51.261 --> 00:12:52.462
- Look. - Da Yeong.

233
00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:57.232
You're curious how I handle tabloid articles?

234
00:12:57.502 --> 00:12:59.531
- Yes. - I don't know how.

235
00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:00.602
Pardon?

236
00:13:01.742 --> 00:13:04.972
I see. You don't?

237
00:13:04.972 --> 00:13:06.942
There's no reason for me to handle such articles.

238
00:13:06.942 --> 00:13:09.381
They are not true. All of them are false stories.

239
00:13:10.141 --> 00:13:12.612
All right. Then...

240
00:13:12.612 --> 00:13:16.452
what about Kang Seok and the vice-chairman of Heesung Group?

241
00:13:16.852 --> 00:13:20.151
- Major-leaguer, Woo Kyu Hwan? - Hey, you.

242
00:13:20.151 --> 00:13:22.462
- A lot of people saw you in Boston. - That little witch.

243
00:13:22.462 --> 00:13:24.161
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

244
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:27.431
- Will you believe me if I say... - All right.

245
00:13:28.602 --> 00:13:30.972
- I've never dated a man? - What?

246
00:13:34.771 --> 00:13:37.771
I've never gone on dates...

247
00:13:37.771 --> 00:13:39.072
nor had boyfriends for that matter.

248
00:13:42.082 --> 00:13:44.482
Come on. Who would believe that?

249
00:13:44.482 --> 00:13:47.011
That was a ridiculous move, Jin Jin. You've never dated?

250
00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:48.322
You've never had a boyfriend?

251
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:49.781
There's nothing shameful about it.

252
00:13:50.322 --> 00:13:52.222
Is that a bad thing?

253
00:13:52.952 --> 00:13:55.891
- Is it? - No, it's not, but...

254
00:13:56.521 --> 00:14:00.261
Goodness, I can't believe this. She's as sly as a fox.

255
00:14:03.232 --> 00:14:04.332
You've never had a boyfriend.

256
00:14:04.332 --> 00:14:05.931
But that's quite hard to believe.

257
00:14:06.702 --> 00:14:07.842
Really?

258
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:10.401
Yes.

259
00:14:13.671 --> 00:14:14.911
Darn it.

260
00:14:18.681 --> 00:14:20.982
Okay. Sure.

261
00:14:23.222 --> 00:14:24.492
My stomach!

262
00:14:24.921 --> 00:14:27.252
My stomach.

263
00:14:27.252 --> 00:14:29.992
- My stomach. - What is this?

264
00:14:29.992 --> 00:14:31.531
My stomach.

265
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:33.161
Darn it.

266
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:35.131
- Do something! - Yes, sir.

267
00:14:35.131 --> 00:14:36.431
My stomach.

268
00:14:36.431 --> 00:14:38.572
Let go. My stomach. Stop it.

269
00:14:38.572 --> 00:14:41.602
Stop it. Don't say anything.

270
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:44.242
- Get rid of him. - My stomach!

271
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:46.742
Don't do anything. Don't.

272
00:14:46.742 --> 00:14:48.311
- My stomach. - What's wrong with him?

273
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:49.911
Let's take a break.

274
00:14:50.442 --> 00:14:52.651
That's so funny. Hold on.

275
00:14:54.452 --> 00:14:56.622
Hey. They say you have a people's voice.

276
00:14:56.752 --> 00:14:57.791
What?

277
00:14:58.192 --> 00:15:00.551
- Is that good or bad? - Right?

278
00:15:00.551 --> 00:15:02.222
- What will you do? - I don't know.

279
00:15:03.692 --> 00:15:05.791
Oh, my... What's wrong?

280
00:15:06.791 --> 00:15:08.261
What's wrong?

281
00:15:08.261 --> 00:15:10.002
That's not it.

282
00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:13.171
It's my fault.

283
00:15:14.102 --> 00:15:17.271
If I had told you not to come by,

284
00:15:17.572 --> 00:15:19.511
you wouldn't be going through this.

285
00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:21.641
It's my fault. I'm so sorry.

286
00:15:22.482 --> 00:15:25.011
That's not true.

287
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:26.651
- That's not true. - I'm sorry.

288
00:15:26.651 --> 00:15:28.622
That's not true. Stop it.

289
00:15:28.622 --> 00:15:31.952
- I'm so sorry... - Come on, now. That's not true.

290
00:15:31.952 --> 00:15:33.891
No, right?

291
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:37.021
- It's okay. It's not, right? - I'm so sorry.

292
00:15:37.021 --> 00:15:39.092
No, it isn't. It's okay.

293
00:15:39.092 --> 00:15:40.462
It's okay.

294
00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:43.732
Why are you crying over something like that?

295
00:15:43.732 --> 00:15:44.832
That's right.

296
00:15:45.502 --> 00:15:47.842
I'm so sorry.

297
00:15:48.842 --> 00:15:50.972
- What should we go eat? - What?

298
00:15:52.112 --> 00:15:54.612
- Sundae? - Sundae.

299
00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:56.881
Right?

300
00:15:58.752 --> 00:16:01.051
Let's go get some sundae.

301
00:16:01.352 --> 00:16:02.752
Stop crying.

302
00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:10.692
(Jin Jin)

303
00:16:11.891 --> 00:16:13.031
Hello?

304
00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:16.131
Were you sleeping? How can you sleep right now?

305
00:16:16.332 --> 00:16:17.631
No, I wasn't.

306
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:20.631
- What is this? - What?

307
00:16:20.732 --> 00:16:22.242
You said it's nothing to be proud of.

308
00:16:22.242 --> 00:16:23.702
What are you talking about?

309
00:16:24.641 --> 00:16:28.011
I know your specialty. Acting dumb.

310
00:16:29.612 --> 00:16:31.651
Fine. I'll play along.

311
00:16:32.011 --> 00:16:33.112
Bye.

312
00:16:39.992 --> 00:16:41.122
Da Yeong.

313
00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:45.732
You want to know how I deal with tabloids?

314
00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:51.972
What happened between you and President Sung last night?

315
00:16:52.372 --> 00:16:56.472
Nothing happened. Let's give up and just wrap things up.

316
00:16:56.472 --> 00:16:57.572
Wrap what...

317
00:16:59.041 --> 00:17:01.781
You worked day and night on it for months.

318
00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:08.781
Yes, sir.

319
00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:13.892
Anyway,

320
00:17:15.361 --> 00:17:17.432
that video spread quickly.

321
00:17:18.091 --> 00:17:19.192
I know.

322
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:21.202
You saved my friend.

323
00:17:21.202 --> 00:17:22.361
I didn't do anything.

324
00:17:22.831 --> 00:17:24.472
You saved your friend.

325
00:17:26.402 --> 00:17:27.742
What a beautiful friendship.

326
00:17:37.111 --> 00:17:39.281
I saw Sa Jin Jin again.

327
00:17:42.222 --> 00:17:43.621
I don't know if you'll believe me,

328
00:17:43.952 --> 00:17:46.752
but I've never dated even once.

329
00:17:46.752 --> 00:17:48.261
- What? - This sounds like a lie.

330
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:52.291
She doesn't lie about things like that.

331
00:17:53.432 --> 00:17:54.531
What?

- Hello? - Are you insane?

334
00:18:18.351 --> 00:18:20.321
I was just about to go in.

335
00:18:20.321 --> 00:18:23.492
You said you were a flight attendant. Why didn't you tell me?

336
00:18:23.662 --> 00:18:26.432
You should've told me right away.

337
00:18:26.531 --> 00:18:29.301
Flight attendants are my dream. You'll introduce me, right?

338
00:18:29.432 --> 00:18:31.771
You can't say you will and then show up yourself.

339
00:18:32.871 --> 00:18:34.031
Hello?

340
00:18:35.271 --> 00:18:36.442
She hung up.

341
00:18:36.442 --> 00:18:38.071
What a jerk.

342
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:42.041
Hello?

Enough to give my father a decent allowance.

355
00:20:16.442 --> 00:20:18.442
- Get rid of him. - My stomach!

356
00:20:18.642 --> 00:20:21.041
Don't do anything. Don't.

357
00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:23.081
- My stomach. - Let's take a break.

358
00:20:25.581 --> 00:20:27.482
It's because of jetlag.

359
00:20:27.482 --> 00:20:30.252
Come out. You're not the only one using the editing room.

360
00:20:30.682 --> 00:20:32.222
- What? - What about the shows?

361
00:20:32.321 --> 00:20:33.621
Let me edit mine.

362
00:20:34.321 --> 00:20:36.761
Right. Yes.

00:20:36.761 --> 00:20:38.492
Here.

364
00:20:44.172 --> 00:20:46.871
Isn't your contract with your agency almost over?

365
00:20:47.402 --> 00:20:51.242
- Yes. - Are you considering moving?

366
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:54.311
- I should go elsewhere. - Where...

367
00:20:55.781 --> 00:20:57.781
If you are considering moving,

368
00:20:58.081 --> 00:21:02.222
the CEO of my agency wants to meet you.

369
00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:06.121
Sure. If you pay me 100 million dollars.

370
00:21:06.121 --> 00:21:07.821
- What? - Then I'll go.

"Universal Feelings"?

375
00:21:32.781 --> 00:21:34.321
- "Universal Feelings"? - Is it a movie?

376
00:21:34.452 --> 00:21:36.281
- Should we watch that? - Yes, let's do that.

377
00:21:36.382 --> 00:21:39.021
(Universal Feelings)

378
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:44.791
Who's that in the poster?

379
00:21:45.761 --> 00:21:47.902
I think she's an idol singer.

380
00:22:30.742 --> 00:22:33.472
How dare you do this in front of our star?

381
00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:42.952
It's okay. It's okay.

Please leave already, will you?

383
00:23:00.732 --> 00:23:03.771
You watched it all, so go.

384
00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:17.791
Mom, I'm hungry.

Okay. Sit.

Why aren't you eating?

389
00:23:50.321 --> 00:23:53.121
You eat up. Here, have some bulgogi.

It's really good. When did you make it?

Eat your breakfast.

392
00:24:18.412 --> 00:24:22.051
You got a job at a tiny company. You think you're so great?

396
00:25:16.541 --> 00:25:18.511
I thought you were Jung Yup.

397
00:25:18.511 --> 00:25:20.041
- No. - I see.

398
00:25:20.242 --> 00:25:22.841
Jenny, I'm sorry.

399
00:25:24.252 --> 00:25:25.382
Don't.

400
00:25:26.551 --> 00:25:28.952
Love means never having to say you're sorry.

401
00:25:30.752 --> 00:25:32.021
No.

402
00:25:32.021 --> 00:25:35.321
Love means being unable to say you're sorry.

that his girlfriend looked like a famous actress,

426
00:26:58.412 --> 00:27:01.011
he committed the crime in a moment of anger toward her.
