00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:11.361
Who is this person?

2
00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:15.065
Is it him?

3
00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:17.000
He is Tae Yang's...

4
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.571
birth father.

5
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:29.346
A lot has changed.

6
00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:32.783
Seoul always feels
new whenever I come.

7
00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:36.753
Did you settle everything in the US
to permanently come back?

8
00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:40.924
I have a lot to do in Korea.

9
00:00:41.258 --> 00:00:42.993
Are you talking about
business matters for the company?

10
00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:45.028
I must find someone.

(Menu Developing Contest
Final Round)

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.268
(Episode 7)

13
00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:52.769
Did you have a good dream
last night?

14
00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:56.339
Yes, two dragons appeared
in front of me,

15
00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.075
and flew to the sky.

16
00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:00.644
- That's a conception dream.
- A conception dream?

17
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:03.947
Why are you touching your stomach?
You're so naive.

18
00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:05.048
Let's go.

19
00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:07.084
Move, move.

20
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.935
Chairman, welcome.

21
00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:26.636
It's been a long time.

22
00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:42.919
Isn't that Chairman Kevin?

23
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.621
He's smiling at you.

24
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.289
I know.

25
00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:48.191
He's coming.

26
00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:51.761
What is your name?

27
00:01:51.828 --> 00:01:53.930
My name is Jung Tae Yang.

28
00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:55.565
Jung Tae Yang?

29
00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:58.935
Are you participating
in today's contest?

30
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.673
Yes, I just made it to the second
round, and I'm here for the finals.

31
00:02:03.907 --> 00:02:06.710
Really? I'll keep an eye on you.

32
00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.012
Let's see how good you've become.

33
00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:15.152
How good he's become?

34
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.360
That's awesome.

35
00:02:23.994 --> 00:02:25.428
I think he recognizes you.

36
00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:26.730
Have you ever met him?

37
00:02:27.197 --> 00:02:28.732
No, I've never met him.

38
00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:31.535
I don't remember meeting him.

39
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.607
He must have mistaken me for him.

40
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:38.808
Who?

41
00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:40.977
Don't you see the sword?
Take it out for me.

42
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:42.612
"Goblin"?

43
00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:49.519
Take it out for me. Darn it.

44
00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:53.356
The contest will start in one hour.

45
00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:57.227
The subject is a table that
captivates your heart.

46
00:02:57.727 --> 00:03:00.163
The final results are up to you.

47
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.166
Do you happen to know...

48
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.435
Jung Tae Yang?

49
00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:07.671
He might be...

50
00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:13.343
the person I'm looking for.

51
00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:16.313
I see.

52
00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:25.855
What does that mean?

53
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.025
It's not enough that I hate
Jung Tae Yang,

54
00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.861
but even the chairman knows him now?

55
00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:33.897
- What should I do?
- Why are you asking?

56
00:03:34.164 --> 00:03:35.298
I'll leave it to you.

57
00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:36.566
Yes, ma'am.

58
00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:54.117
Here.

59
00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:57.487
You'll calm down after drinking
this bamboo shoot tea.

60
00:04:01.358 --> 00:04:02.459
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:04.861
I'll drink it later.

62
00:04:08.298 --> 00:04:12.068
Tell me the secret you're hiding.

63
00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:14.838
What is it? Why are you so alarmed?

64
00:04:15.438 --> 00:04:17.607
Why are you suddenly looking
at the photo of Tae Yang's father?

65
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.112
It's nothing.

66
00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:25.482
He just threatened me,
so it bothered me.

67
00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:28.852
- How did he threaten you?
- I already told you.

68
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.722
Someone was investigating me, and
he'll let people know if he's upset.

69
00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:36.559
- What's he going to let them know?
- Why are you so curious?

70
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.995
Did you already forget
what you said?

71
00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:42.165
You said it didn't matter what
kind of woman I was and what I did.

72
00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:43.300
Was that a lie?

73
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.601
Is that why you're interrogating me?

74
00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:46.036
Don't you know me?

75
00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.038
I'll have to know
what is happening...

76
00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:51.908
- to protect you.
- I don't need your protection.

77
00:04:52.242 --> 00:04:54.611
I'll handle my own business.
Just pretend that you don't know.

78
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:55.979
That's how you can help me.

79
00:04:56.313 --> 00:04:57.914
Is this related
to Tae Yang's father?

80
00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:02.786
It must be.

81
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.854
What is it?

82
00:05:04.854 --> 00:05:06.723
What happened between you two?

83
00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:10.593
How come you never talk about him
to Tae Yang and me?

84
00:05:14.864 --> 00:05:16.299
Do you really want to know?

85
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:19.602
The moment you find out the truth,

86
00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:22.405
I will not be the same,

87
00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:25.108
and so will you.

88
00:05:25.108 --> 00:05:26.176
That very moment,

89
00:05:27.177 --> 00:05:29.412
your love for me will disappear
into thin air.

90
00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.480
Honey.

91
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.182
Do you still want to know the truth?

92
00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:35.885
Fine.

93
00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:38.421
If that's what you want,
I'll tell you.

94
00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:44.494
- Mom!
- Mom!

95
00:05:44.494 --> 00:05:45.495
Let's have a party.

96
00:05:45.495 --> 00:05:47.564
Eun Byul wants to throw a party for
Tae Yang if he wins the contest.

97
00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:49.466
We already bought
everything we need.

98
00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:52.369
How nice. That was
so nice of you, Eun Byul.

99
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.536
Let me see.

100
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.238
I brought a lot, didn't I?

101
00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.742
I hope he wins.

(Menu Developing Contest
Final Round)

103
00:06:04.748 --> 00:06:08.718
The final round
of SC Food and Beverage's...

104
00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:10.754
menu developing contest
will begin now.

105
00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:14.657
Today's theme is making the best
meal with the worst ingredients.

106
00:06:14.858 --> 00:06:16.559
In our company's freezer,

107
00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:19.729
various frozen ingredients
are prepared for you to cook.

108
00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:23.233
You'll be given only an hour.
Within your given time,

109
00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:26.169
you must defrost and cook the best
meal with cheap ingredients.

110
00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:27.670
This is impossible.

111
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.106
How can we cook with frozen
ingredients within an hour?

112
00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:31.541
Just shut it,
and do what I tell you to do.

113
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:32.909
I'm the chef here.

114
00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:38.615
Strangely, I hate that guy.

115
00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:43.286
Chairman Kevin has selected
this special ingredient.

116
00:06:43.787 --> 00:06:45.789
Let me reveal it to you now.

117
00:06:50.226 --> 00:06:52.295
What does he mean
by special ingredient?

118
00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:53.997
That will be today's
main ingredient.

119
00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.435
There are so many things
to keep up with.

120
00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.505
They must be kidding me.

121
00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:04.307
I knew it. This is like him.

122
00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:12.749
You should use eggs as your
main ingredient.

123
00:07:12.816 --> 00:07:15.051
Please make the best meal
with what's given.

124
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:16.853
Your time beings now.

125
00:07:22.058 --> 00:07:23.293
You're ready, right?

126
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.922
Where's beef tenderloin?

127
00:07:53.356 --> 00:07:56.359
Chef, I found the tenderloin!

128
00:07:58.161 --> 00:07:59.496
Do you think that will
defrost in time?

129
00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:03.366
Thank you.

130
00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:10.039
Start boiling water. We need to
defrost the meat first.

131
00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:11.674
Blanch the vegetables
in the hot water just slightly.

132
00:08:11.674 --> 00:08:13.910
Rinse the frozen cockles with water.

133
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.911
What about the rest?

134
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.679
I'll take care of the rest.

135
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:18.348
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:08:18.348 --> 00:08:20.617
- Hurry.
- Yes, chef.

137
00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:22.485
- Let's hurry.
- Did you get everything?

138
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:33.096
Where is seaweed fulvescens?

139
00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:01.758
He's been taken care of.

140
00:09:01.758 --> 00:09:03.593
Don't worry, and enjoy the contest.

141

(Choi Sun Young)

142
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.639
Congratulations, Father.

143
00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:18.341
You'll be a grandfather soon.

144
00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:19.576
All right.

145
00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.246
There isn't much in life.

146
00:09:24.747 --> 00:09:26.516
This is the joy of life.

147
00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:29.619
Hold on.

148
00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:32.488
What should I buy them
for their present?

149
00:09:33.222 --> 00:09:36.759
Since her family is rich,
I can't give her cash.

150
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:40.697
That's right! This is it.

151

(Lee Kyuh La)

152
00:10:09.092 --> 00:10:10.126
All right.

153
00:10:10.994 --> 00:10:12.095
This is good.

154
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:17.734
We have to head out soon.
Aren't you going to get ready?

155
00:10:17.734 --> 00:10:19.469
Okay. I'm going to.

156
00:10:19.502 --> 00:10:21.504
Wait. Hold on.

157
00:10:24.741 --> 00:10:25.775
What is it?

158
00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:28.077
What is this?

159
00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.247
Was there something on my face?

160
00:10:33.616 --> 00:10:34.984
It's your beauty.

161
00:10:38.688 --> 00:10:42.225
Goodness, you said you'll
give me one last chance.

162
00:10:42.525 --> 00:10:44.627
I have to survive even if it means
making jokes like this.

163
00:10:44.861 --> 00:10:46.496
Don't you think so, Young Hye?

164
00:10:46.496 --> 00:10:48.531
Goodness, what are you doing?

165
00:10:48.531 --> 00:10:50.600
- Come on.
- What's the matter with you? Stop.

166
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.734
- I won't stop.
- What's up with you?

167
00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.369
- I'll keep doing this.
- What are you doing?

168
00:10:53.369 --> 00:10:55.104
Oh, my. I can feel your potbelly.

169
00:10:55.104 --> 00:10:58.007
- That's quite chubby.
- Please stop!

170
00:10:58.007 --> 00:10:59.976
- There's a lot of fat there.
- Goodness.

171
00:10:59.976 --> 00:11:02.145
- We can do something with this.
- I told you to stop.

172
00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:06.249
Goodness, it hurts. How dare you?

173
00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:09.218
I told you to stop.
Why did you keep touching me?

174
00:11:09.285 --> 00:11:10.486
Unbelievable.

175
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.221
Hey.

176
00:11:13.122 --> 00:11:15.358
Do you think I like doing this?

177
00:11:15.358 --> 00:11:18.695
To be honest, there's nothing
to see since you're old.

178
00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:21.764
I was just trying my best
to have a good life.

179
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:25.001
I'm putting all of my effort,
but you can't even play along?

180
00:11:27.737 --> 00:11:30.239
What? Am I wrong?

181
00:11:32.675 --> 00:11:34.477
Are you going to tell me
you want to gradate marriage again?

182
00:11:36.345 --> 00:11:38.748
No, I'm sorry.

183
00:11:39.248 --> 00:11:42.218
I'm the one who deserves
all the blame, but...

184
00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:45.254
I need some time to adjust.

185
00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:48.224
Forgive me.

186
00:11:49.826 --> 00:11:50.993
Be careful.

187
00:11:56.499 --> 00:11:59.769
But don't you think
we might be going overboard?

188
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.472
It's not like she has
delivered her baby yet.

189
00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.440
She just got pregnant.

190
00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.275
What are you talking about?

191
00:12:06.576 --> 00:12:08.778
Children begin their education
in their mothers' womb.

192
00:12:08.778 --> 00:12:13.216
If I want my grandchild to be
as successful as So Won,

193
00:12:13.216 --> 00:12:16.085
we need to work hard
for the child's education.

194
00:12:18.621 --> 00:12:20.857
That child is going
to have a tough life.

195
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.593
What? What did you say?

196
00:12:23.693 --> 00:12:24.861
Come back.

197
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.497
Why?

198
00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:28.731
Come here!

199
00:12:36.072 --> 00:12:37.573
Do you think I'm a joke?

200
00:12:37.607 --> 00:12:39.475
Now that I treat you like a queen,

201
00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:41.477
do you think you're better than me?

202
00:12:42.712 --> 00:12:43.946
Let me warn you.

203
00:12:43.946 --> 00:12:46.616
Don't use marriage graduation
as a weapon and look down on me.

204
00:12:47.316 --> 00:12:49.485
Honey, when did I...

205
00:12:49.485 --> 00:12:50.620
I told you.

206
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.722
When it comes
to educating our children,

207
00:12:52.755 --> 00:12:54.390
you don't have a say in that.

208
00:12:54.957 --> 00:12:58.761
Because I took charge and matched
a good wife for So Won,

209
00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:01.197
he has become a successful
doctor from a nobody.

210
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.366
Have you forgotten what I have done?

211
00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:05.601
Are you talking
about Su Mi right now?

212
00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:06.702
Hey!

213
00:13:07.136 --> 00:13:08.638
I already warned you.

214
00:13:08.938 --> 00:13:11.107
Don't even bring up her name.

215
00:13:14.777 --> 00:13:18.014
Anyway, as long as...

216
00:13:18.147 --> 00:13:21.984
I have a healthy grandchild,

217
00:13:22.118 --> 00:13:27.023
my 35-year plan will be
completed at last.

218
00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:30.593
So a stupid housewife like you,
whose perspective is limited...

219
00:13:30.593 --> 00:13:33.529
as you only cooked food at home,

220
00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:35.865
should just need to listen to me.
Okay?

221
00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.369
Understood?

222
00:13:50.213 --> 00:13:54.350
I have heard your reputation
in this industry.

223
00:13:54.717 --> 00:13:56.853
She's my only daughter.

224
00:13:56.853 --> 00:13:59.088
It's been four years
since she got married,

225
00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.857
but she can't seem to get pregnant.

226
00:14:00.857 --> 00:14:02.425
Please help us.

227
00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:03.626
It's true.

228
00:14:04.493 --> 00:14:06.295
I must conceive a child.

229
00:14:06.295 --> 00:14:09.332
My husband thinks that I'm pregnant
right now.

230
00:14:09.332 --> 00:14:12.568
I'm getting infertility
treatment from the clinic also.

231
00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:16.105
But the whole universe must come
together and give me a way.

232
00:14:16.372 --> 00:14:17.840
I will perform an exorcism
if necessary...

233
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.609
or carry talismans if I have to.

234
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.378
Gosh, you're pathetic.

235
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.114
What?

236
00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:27.250
Who's pathetic?

237
00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.253
Am I pathetic? Is it me?

238
00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:31.354
Yes.

239
00:14:31.988 --> 00:14:35.124
Wrapping yourself with expensive
clothes won't do you any good.

240
00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:37.093
Your heart is a rag.

241
00:14:37.827 --> 00:14:41.230
Even if you use money
as your sitting cushion,

242
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.734
you're no better than a drunk beggar
at Seoul Station, you witch.

243
00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:46.235
Witch?

244
00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:48.971
Is that how you talk
to your clients?

245
00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:52.975
Give it to me. Let me see your ring.

246
00:14:53.242 --> 00:14:54.644
- Why?
- Give it to me.

247
00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:57.146
Goodness. You must've gone mad.

248
00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:07.857
What is it?

249
00:15:08.758 --> 00:15:09.926
What?

250
00:15:13.195 --> 00:15:14.964
- I'm tired.
- Gosh.

251
00:15:14.964 --> 00:15:16.265
Hurry.

252
00:15:16.732 --> 00:15:18.234
- Oh, my.
- My legs hurt.

253
00:15:18.234 --> 00:15:19.635
Hurry up, and come here.

254
00:15:19.635 --> 00:15:21.837
I'm tired.

255
00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:24.607
My legs hurt!

256
00:15:25.074 --> 00:15:26.475
I said let's go!

257
00:15:34.951 --> 00:15:36.986
Mom, I'm scared.

258
00:15:36.986 --> 00:15:38.754
He's gone mad.

259
00:15:38.955 --> 00:15:40.856
- I want to go home.
- Be quiet. Shut it.

260
00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:42.758
He must be seeing something.
Be quiet.

261
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.527
Did you see something?

262
00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.195
Are you sensing something?

263
00:15:46.395 --> 00:15:48.097
You should be punished.

264
00:15:50.232 --> 00:15:52.201
You punk.
What are you talking about?

265
00:15:52.435 --> 00:15:53.502
Don't you have any respect
for your elders?

266
00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:56.005
Is that all you have to say?

267
00:15:56.105 --> 00:15:57.640
I see a little boy.

268
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:00.076
You witch!

269
00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:04.113
You've done something evil. That's
why your daughter can't have kids.

270
00:16:04.447 --> 00:16:06.315
It doesn't matter whether it takes
hundreds or thousands of years.

271
00:16:06.482 --> 00:16:08.150
Regardless of gender,

272
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.586
your breed will be dry,
and you'll have no descendants.

273
00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:12.021
Shut it, you punk!

274
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.857
You're speaking carelessly.

275
00:16:14.857 --> 00:16:18.995
You're ruining the future
of my daughter, you jerk.

276
00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:20.363
Is that all you have to say?

277
00:16:20.363 --> 00:16:22.098
Don't you even dare say
something like this again.

278
00:16:22.098 --> 00:16:25.101
I'm going to take your tongue out
if you speak another word.

279
00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:28.237
Mind your own business.

280
00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:30.139
I knew he would be a charlatan.

281
00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:33.576
I can't believe
someone crazy like him exists.

282
00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:36.278
- Mom, wait for me.
- Hold on!

283
00:16:36.946 --> 00:16:37.980
Yes?

284
00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:43.085
You need to pay before you go.

285
00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:44.220
I'll pay.

286
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.525
Mom, wait for me.

287
00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:59.368
You can't pretend
that it didn't happen.

288
00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:04.073
You are so foolish.

289
00:17:08.244 --> 00:17:12.048
Your sin will pay back soon.

290
00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:18.421
That was disastrous.

291
00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:19.889
Mom, are you okay?

292
00:17:19.889 --> 00:17:22.525
Your lips are so pale.
It looks like you'll faint soon.

293
00:17:22.525 --> 00:17:24.226
He's just putting up a show.

294
00:17:24.326 --> 00:17:26.729
How will a charlatan like him know?

295
00:17:26.729 --> 00:17:31.067
Don't mind him.
That's just all superstition.

296
00:17:31.067 --> 00:17:34.737
Let's go pray somewhere else
and never come back here.

297
00:17:34.737 --> 00:17:36.105
Okay.

298
00:17:36.338 --> 00:17:38.541
I could go to the underworld
to turn...

299
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:40.309
the heart of my husband back to me.

300
00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:41.677
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

301
00:17:42.178 --> 00:17:45.514
Let's go pray

302
00:17:47.216 --> 00:17:48.584
(Every success starts
from a weak start.)

303
00:17:48.584 --> 00:17:50.252
(Don't dream of getting rich quick.
Good Network Korea)

304
00:17:55.724 --> 00:17:56.959
Have you eaten yet?

305
00:18:01.764 --> 00:18:02.998
You're Jung Su Ji, right?

306
00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:07.503
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

307
00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:08.571
Follow me.

308
00:18:10.806 --> 00:18:12.575
- Who are you?
- Move.

309
00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:15.377
If you don't, I'll report her to the
police for child abandonment.

310
00:18:16.045 --> 00:18:18.380
Let's go. I also have a lot to say.

311
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:33.329
Is it because you're a doctor?
You're smarter than you look.

312
00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:34.763
How did you find me?

313
00:18:34.763 --> 00:18:37.333
You were the temporary guardian
for Han Gyul's preschool.

314
00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:40.569
Why are you doing this?

315
00:18:40.569 --> 00:18:42.338
I'm really busy.

316
00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:45.407
I'm busy doing business. I have
no time to take care of my niece.

317
00:18:45.641 --> 00:18:47.443
That's why I sent her to you,
so you can take care of her.

318
00:18:47.443 --> 00:18:48.744
Why should I be responsible...

319
00:18:52.014 --> 00:18:53.315
for her?

320
00:18:53.315 --> 00:18:54.683
I told you.

321
00:18:54.984 --> 00:18:57.486
My sister's life was ruined
because of you.

322
00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.657
You should take responsibility
to atone now.

323
00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:02.892
Where is Su Mi right now?

324
00:19:03.325 --> 00:19:05.794
What is she doing
when her child is like that?

325
00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:09.498
Are you laughing? Do you feel
like laughing right now?

326
00:19:10.699 --> 00:19:12.735
Don't you have a conscience?

327
00:19:13.035 --> 00:19:15.004
How could you abandon a young child
irresponsibly like that?

328
00:19:15.004 --> 00:19:16.105
Excuse me.

329
00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:18.774
Sometimes there are situations
where you can't help...

330
00:19:18.774 --> 00:19:21.544
but be irresponsible
even if you want to be responsible.

331
00:19:21.677 --> 00:19:23.546
What kind of situation is that?

332
00:19:23.546 --> 00:19:25.247
Ask her yourself.

333
00:19:28.984 --> 00:19:30.186
Where is she?

334
00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:32.988
- In Cheongju.
- Cheongju?

335
00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:35.491
Our country needed her there.

336
00:19:36.825 --> 00:19:37.993
Do you understand now?

337
00:19:37.993 --> 00:19:39.962
While you were happy
with a rich woman's daughter...

338
00:19:39.995 --> 00:19:43.432
all because
of your distinguished father,

339
00:19:44.233 --> 00:19:46.769
my poor sister's life was ruined.

340
00:20:08.157 --> 00:20:09.225
My phone.

341
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.128
I left it in the waiting room.

342
00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:19.568
Hey! Excuse me!

343
00:20:20.035 --> 00:20:21.537
There's someone in here.

344
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.242
Hey.

345
00:20:26.942 --> 00:20:28.210
Is anybody there?

346
00:20:29.345 --> 00:20:30.446
Hey.

347
00:20:32.248 --> 00:20:34.283
Dong Ki.

348
00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:38.153
What brings you here?

349
00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:40.723
This is Oh Mok Sin's father.

350
00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:42.925
- This is my wife.
- Long time no see.

351
00:20:43.525 --> 00:20:47.263
You'll have to start calling
her differently.

352
00:20:47.396 --> 00:20:49.131
We will soon become in-laws.

353
00:20:49.131 --> 00:20:51.267
She'll become the
mother-in-law of your son.

354
00:20:51.267 --> 00:20:52.468
That's right.

355
00:20:53.802 --> 00:20:57.139
Mok Sin dressed up today
to meet your daughter.

356
00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:00.576
Ru Ri made a good decision
to marry my son.

357
00:21:00.709 --> 00:21:03.545
We won't make her have a hard time
in our household,

358
00:21:03.545 --> 00:21:06.382
since my wife already passed away.

359
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:10.319
She was quite impatient.

360
00:21:10.452 --> 00:21:12.554
Why did she hurry off like that?

361
00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:19.228
Here's some medicine for
my daughter-in-law.

362
00:21:19.795 --> 00:21:23.165
It will help make her womb healthy.
Make sure she takes it.

363
00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:24.233
Okay.

364
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.003
Why does your wife look so worried?

365
00:21:28.003 --> 00:21:29.938
Are you guys still talking about
marriage graduation?

366
00:21:29.938 --> 00:21:31.273
Do you think I'd let that happen?

367
00:21:32.074 --> 00:21:35.711
She was begging me to take her back,
so I forgave her.

368
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:37.546
Is she nicer now?

369
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.516
That's not easy.

370
00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:42.251
I thought so.

371
00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:44.520
She must have
a lot of hard feelings.

372
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.355
Make it concrete.

373
00:21:46.922 --> 00:21:49.124
- What?
- Sleep together.

374
00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:51.927
The physical distance equals to the
psychological distance.

375
00:21:52.294 --> 00:21:53.595
That's why I'm telling you.

376
00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:58.500
Get some restorative Chinese
medicine. It'll give you stamina.

377
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.570
Even if you don't have
any customers,

378
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.605
you can't make me your customer.

379
00:22:03.605 --> 00:22:05.474
It's all for your sake.

380
00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:08.444
They call it the "Ugly 60s".
If you lose your wife's favor,

381
00:22:08.444 --> 00:22:10.346
you might die alone just like
how Jong Gu died.

382
00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:11.780
I'm still alive.

383
00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:16.085
I have so much stamina.
I don't need medicines.

384
00:22:16.318 --> 00:22:17.453
Do you want to see?

385
00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.723
Let me show you.

386
00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:22.825
Just wait and see.

387
00:22:33.268 --> 00:22:36.405
I'm late. I need to go.

388
00:22:39.174 --> 00:22:40.476
Come back if you need them.

389
00:22:40.709 --> 00:22:43.445
The medicine is really effective.

390
00:22:43.946 --> 00:22:45.180
Here you go.

391
00:22:46.949 --> 00:22:50.285
We got some Chinese medicine
prescribed for Yeon Ju.

392
00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:53.555
We're cautious because it's
the early stages of her pregnancy,

393
00:22:53.655 --> 00:22:56.525
but this will help strengthen
her womb.

394
00:22:57.025 --> 00:22:58.060
Okay.

395
00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:01.497
But Mrs. Hong...

396
00:23:02.264 --> 00:23:07.269
I have to tell you something
about her pregnancy.

397
00:23:07.403 --> 00:23:11.006
Mother, thank you very much.

398
00:23:12.241 --> 00:23:16.044
I'll take it on time. Thank you.

399
00:23:16.044 --> 00:23:19.748
Okay, forget about dieting.

400
00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:23.185
You must eat a lot for Kyuh La.

401
00:23:23.285 --> 00:23:25.254
Kyuh La?

402
00:23:25.254 --> 00:23:27.389
Oh, right. I forgot.

403
00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:30.993
Here. I got this for you.

404
00:23:36.398 --> 00:23:39.668
Father, what is this?

405
00:23:40.335 --> 00:23:43.205
Lee Kyuh La, let's win.

406
00:23:43.739 --> 00:23:46.074
What does this mean?

407
00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:47.276
Let's win?

408
00:23:47.443 --> 00:23:50.379
Is there a soccer match?

409
00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:55.284
He made a nickname for the baby.

410
00:23:55.784 --> 00:23:57.719
Life is like a battlefield.

411
00:23:57.986 --> 00:24:00.456
Our grandchild should always win.

412
00:24:01.723 --> 00:24:03.459
Please keep calling this name.

413
00:24:03.459 --> 00:24:06.795
Kyuh La, let's win.

414
00:24:15.337 --> 00:24:20.275
Father, that's a really good
nickname.

415
00:24:20.776 --> 00:24:23.479
I'll prepare some coffee.

416
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.484
Don't you like green tea?
Please wait for a minute.

417
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.455
They must be really pleased.

418
00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:41.763
What should I do?

419
00:24:43.065 --> 00:24:46.568
This is serious.
This is very serious.

420
00:24:46.702 --> 00:24:49.471
I'll just tell the truth.

421
00:24:49.471 --> 00:24:53.075
No, you can't. Don't tell them
now when they seem so happy.

422
00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:55.010
Father might hate me.

423
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.914
Lies will only lead to other lies.
They will then follow other lies.

424
00:24:59.047 --> 00:25:02.451
Your belly is supposed to get
bigger soon. What will you do then?

425
00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:05.053
It's better to tell them now.

426
00:25:05.053 --> 00:25:07.556
You can't. Mom, you can't.

427
00:25:07.956 --> 00:25:10.726
Mom, life is all about the timing.

428
00:25:10.893 --> 00:25:13.962
We should not act up.
We need to endure this.

429
00:25:13.962 --> 00:25:16.498
Let's relax. Relax.

430
00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:22.905
Gosh, when did my life
become so negative?

431
00:25:22.905 --> 00:25:26.708
I don't know why this is
happening to me. Gosh.

432
00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:28.744
Do you want sugar?

433
00:25:29.144 --> 00:25:30.946
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

434
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.881
Gosh.

435
00:25:41.657 --> 00:25:43.325
Why isn't he coming?

436
00:25:56.104 --> 00:25:57.406
What happened?

437
00:25:57.406 --> 00:25:59.274
Did something happen to him again?

438
00:26:01.176 --> 00:26:02.878
What happened to Jung Tae Yang?

439
00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.681
I don't know either.

440
00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:08.750
He was in the refrigerated warehouse
a few moments ago.

441
00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:11.420
I will go and get him.

442
00:26:14.089 --> 00:26:16.525
If both contestants leave
this room at the same time,

443
00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:18.961
it will count as a withdrawal.
You know that, right?

444
00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:20.429
What?

445
00:26:51.627 --> 00:26:52.828
- Can I have that?
- Okay.

446
00:26:52.828 --> 00:26:54.730
- Why is this so hard?
- Do you want me to help you?

447
00:26:56.932 --> 00:26:59.001
What happened with Tae Yang's
father?

448
00:26:59.001 --> 00:27:00.936
Why are you keeping it a secret
to everyone?

449
00:27:08.043 --> 00:27:09.878
- Oh, my!
- You surprised me.

450
00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:11.146
What if Tae Yang doesn't win?

451
00:27:11.146 --> 00:27:13.815
- What?
- That's why I prepared this.

452
00:27:13.815 --> 00:27:14.883
What is that?

453
00:27:14.883 --> 00:27:16.451
Ta-da.

454
00:27:16.818 --> 00:27:18.286
"Don't worry, Tae Yang."

455
00:27:18.286 --> 00:27:20.489
"We have a young father
to take care of us."

456
00:27:20.489 --> 00:27:21.590
What did you say?

457
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.492
It's hard enough raising you two.

458
00:27:23.525 --> 00:27:25.627
You want me to financially support
Tae Yang too?

459
00:27:25.627 --> 00:27:27.629
- Give it to me. I can't.
- Gosh, you're so mean.

460
00:27:27.629 --> 00:27:28.730
Dad.

461
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.667
You need to grow up,
not physically but mentally.

462
00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:34.569
This is not why I raised you guys.

463
00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:36.505
I'm mortified.

464
00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:39.274
- Let's make more balloons.
- Okay.

465
00:27:39.908 --> 00:27:41.476
Mom, the cake!

466
00:27:44.913 --> 00:27:45.914
Oh, my.

467
00:27:46.515 --> 00:27:48.016
Gosh!

468
00:27:49.685 --> 00:27:50.886
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

469
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.256
You shouldn't do this.
You should go inside and rest.

470
00:27:55.223 --> 00:27:56.258
Let's go.

471
00:28:06.835 --> 00:28:08.270
Honey, I'm sorry.

472
00:28:09.438 --> 00:28:11.740
I really want to
tell you everything,

473
00:28:12.274 --> 00:28:15.377
but I'm scared
that I might lose you.

474
00:28:15.377 --> 00:28:18.747
I'm also scared that something
might happen to Tae yang.

475
00:28:20.515 --> 00:28:22.150
If the world learns about this,

476
00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.653
will you and Tae Yang be in danger?

477
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.555
Yes.

478
00:28:27.589 --> 00:28:29.324
Who else knows about this?

479
00:28:29.524 --> 00:28:30.926
Does Woo Joo's father
know about this?

480
00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:34.629
No, he probably doesn't.
He can't know about this.

481
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:37.666
I never told anyone.

482
00:28:38.467 --> 00:28:40.335
Only Tae Yang's father and I
know about this.

483
00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:42.637
Then where is he now?

484
00:28:42.704 --> 00:28:44.005
Do you know where he lives?

485
00:28:45.741 --> 00:28:47.743
Where? Where does he live?

486
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.247
No, I don't know. Gosh.

487
00:28:53.014 --> 00:28:55.450
He must be dead. I'm sure of it.

488
00:28:57.753 --> 00:29:01.189
All right. In that case,
you don't need to worry.

489
00:29:01.523 --> 00:29:04.192
Even if Choi Sun Young tries to
find out about you,

490
00:29:04.693 --> 00:29:06.461
she won't learn anything.

491
00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:11.399
I won't ask you about this anymore.

492
00:29:12.067 --> 00:29:14.503
I can wait until you're ready.

493
00:29:15.237 --> 00:29:17.939
So don't beat yourself up over this.

494
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.775
If you're upset,

495
00:29:20.008 --> 00:29:22.677
we will all be upset as well.

496
00:29:23.245 --> 00:29:26.815
So just promise me that, okay?

497
00:29:44.933 --> 00:29:47.903
What on earth
happened to Jung Tae Yang?

498
00:29:48.136 --> 00:29:49.838
Well, that is...

499
00:29:50.005 --> 00:29:51.706
Don't worry, Chairman.

500
00:29:51.706 --> 00:29:54.709
He was late to the second round
as well.

501
00:29:54.976 --> 00:29:56.978
He must have run away...

502
00:29:57.212 --> 00:29:59.414
because he's either scared
or unsure of himself.

503
00:29:59.614 --> 00:30:00.682
Really?

504
00:30:01.983 --> 00:30:03.518
I didn't know that happened.

505
00:30:03.518 --> 00:30:06.254
Cowards like him participate
from time to time.

506
00:30:06.688 --> 00:30:09.991
They get scared after they meet
their competitors.

507
00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:34.916
Is Jung Tae Yang withdrawing
from the contest?

508
00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:37.886
No, he isn't. He's never going to
give up.

509
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.088
I'll go look for him.

510
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.426
If you go out like this,
it means you're withdrawing.

511
00:31:00.141 --> 00:31:01.276
Manager Jung.

512
00:31:01.743 --> 00:31:04.145
Manager Jung, it's Ru Ri.
Are you in there?

513
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.014
Manager Jung!

514
00:31:09.784 --> 00:31:11.086
Maybe he's not in there.

515
00:31:46.087 --> 00:31:47.389
(Lee Ru Ri)

516
00:31:51.226 --> 00:31:53.295
Something must have happened.

517
00:31:57.465 --> 00:32:00.635
It's here.
Can you please open it for me?

518
00:32:00.835 --> 00:32:03.438
I told you many times.

519
00:32:03.538 --> 00:32:04.906
No one would be in there.

520
00:32:04.906 --> 00:32:07.475
Please, just for once.
I'll just take a look.

521
00:32:07.475 --> 00:32:09.377
It's not something difficult.

522
00:32:09.377 --> 00:32:10.745
Gosh.

523
00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:22.223
Manager Jung.

524
00:32:22.958 --> 00:32:26.594
Manager Jung. Wake up, Manager Jung.
Manager Jung!

525
00:32:26.594 --> 00:32:29.264
No, you can't die!

526
00:32:29.564 --> 00:32:31.333
Why aren't you
calling the ambulance?

527
00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:32.534
All right.

528
00:32:32.834 --> 00:32:35.003
Manager Jung! Manager Jung!

529
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:39.774
We'll be announcing the winner
of the menu developing contest.

530
00:32:40.575 --> 00:32:44.379
The Chairman himself will be
announcing the winner.

531
00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:46.414
Well done, everyone.

532
00:32:46.648 --> 00:32:50.652
I want to thank you again
for participating in this contest.

533
00:32:51.319 --> 00:32:54.089
After considering carefully,
we've decided...

534
00:32:54.255 --> 00:32:57.058
that the winner is
No Ji Shim's team,

535
00:32:57.158 --> 00:33:00.128
who made egg and sweet potato
patatas bravas and meat jeon.

536
00:33:00.128 --> 00:33:01.529
We won!

537
00:33:02.063 --> 00:33:03.231
We won!

538
00:33:11.973 --> 00:33:13.074
Congratulations.

539
00:33:16.678 --> 00:33:17.946
Thank you.

540
00:33:33.995 --> 00:33:36.564
You've worked so hard, Chairman.

541
00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:41.169
What happened to Jung Tae Yang?

542
00:33:41.169 --> 00:33:42.804
I was right.

543
00:33:43.338 --> 00:33:45.707
I found out that he had withdrawn
from the contest.

544
00:33:45.707 --> 00:33:46.775
Really?

545
00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:50.278
That's disappointing.

546
00:33:51.246 --> 00:33:53.314
I must have misread him.

547
00:33:53.615 --> 00:33:56.518
It seems like you've known him
for a long time.

548
00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.389
How do you know him?

549
00:34:03.925 --> 00:34:05.727
Let's just say that
he saved my life.

550
00:34:08.029 --> 00:34:10.799
Unfortunately, we might
not see each other again.

551
00:34:12.667 --> 00:34:13.835
You can go now.

552
00:34:13.835 --> 00:34:16.204
All right. Goodbye.

553
00:34:37.759 --> 00:34:42.363
(Jung Tae Yang)

554
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.001
Jung Tae Yang.

555
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.014
Where am I...

556
00:35:33.014 --> 00:35:35.550
Manager Jung. Are you awake?

557
00:35:36.317 --> 00:35:38.586
I thought you were going to die.

558
00:35:42.323 --> 00:35:44.626
Who's this? Are you Ru Ri?

559
00:35:46.528 --> 00:35:47.729
Manager Jung.

560
00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:49.164
Why is it so dark here?

561
00:35:49.898 --> 00:35:51.533
Is it still night?

562
00:35:51.666 --> 00:35:56.337
Can you not see anything?

563
00:35:56.704 --> 00:36:00.475
Can't you see anything because
you were trapped in the fridge?

564
00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:04.646
Wait here. I'll call the doctor.

565
00:36:04.646 --> 00:36:05.780
No, wait.

566
00:36:08.082 --> 00:36:09.684
It's just my eyes are still frozen.

567
00:36:09.684 --> 00:36:12.754
It's still cold. Thaw my eyes
like this.

568
00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:13.821
Your eyes?

569
00:36:13.821 --> 00:36:15.356
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

570
00:36:20.295 --> 00:36:21.462
This one too.

571
00:36:21.796 --> 00:36:22.964
This one?

572
00:36:25.567 --> 00:36:26.834
Are you okay now?

573
00:36:27.936 --> 00:36:31.105
My eyes are fine. Thaw my lips.

574
00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:33.374
Lips? Okay.

575
00:36:47.455 --> 00:36:51.626
Hey. Are you naive or dumb?

576
00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.295
How can you joke around?

577
00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:56.364
You're so mean.

578
00:36:56.998 --> 00:36:59.434
You're sick in bed because
you were trapped in the fridge,

579
00:36:59.434 --> 00:37:02.804
but that company blamed you
and didn't care.

580
00:37:04.005 --> 00:37:06.874
I was worried you wouldn't wake up.

581
00:37:08.543 --> 00:37:12.146
I almost had a heart attack.

582
00:37:12.513 --> 00:37:13.815
Do you like me that much?

583
00:37:19.454 --> 00:37:22.090
I'll leave now that you're awake.

584
00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:25.193
Take me with you.

585
00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.628
No, you can't get up.

586
00:37:26.628 --> 00:37:29.230
The doctor said you should stay
in the hospital tonight.

587
00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.732
I don't want to stay here.

588
00:37:31.065 --> 00:37:32.734
I have to go before my mom
gets worried.

589
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:38.006
What are you going to do now?

590
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.209
What can I do?
I should go back to Guam.

591
00:37:41.976 --> 00:37:45.146
I blew up the competition.
I can't stay jobless.

592
00:37:45.647 --> 00:37:50.084
Am I not going to see you again?

593
00:37:55.089 --> 00:37:56.324
I know...

594
00:37:57.025 --> 00:38:01.029
you were going to follow my decision
if we win the competition,

595
00:38:01.796 --> 00:38:03.731
but since we didn't win,

596
00:38:04.565 --> 00:38:07.335
our relationship's over as well.

597
00:38:10.071 --> 00:38:11.239
Follow me.

598
00:38:11.339 --> 00:38:13.007
To where?

599
00:38:13.474 --> 00:38:15.209
There's something
I want to show you.

600
00:38:22.383 --> 00:38:23.484
What do you think?

601
00:38:24.085 --> 00:38:25.820
This is beautiful.

602
00:38:27.188 --> 00:38:31.259
Is this a reward for
what I went through today?

603
00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:33.494
This is nice.

604
00:38:36.531 --> 00:38:37.665
Manager Jung.

605
00:38:38.666 --> 00:38:39.834
Lie down here.

606
00:38:43.905 --> 00:38:45.073
Come on.

607
00:38:53.047 --> 00:38:54.282
What do you see?

608
00:38:56.417 --> 00:39:00.588
I see a few stars in dark night sky.

609
00:39:00.955 --> 00:39:03.958
What's really beautiful isn't
fancy lights,

610
00:39:04.959 --> 00:39:06.627
but the stars that glow in the dark.

611
00:39:08.563 --> 00:39:09.731
Do you know why?

612
00:39:11.899 --> 00:39:14.335
Someone must turn on the light,

613
00:39:15.169 --> 00:39:16.904
but stars glow by themselves.

614
00:39:17.672 --> 00:39:21.442
That's why they are
valuable and loved.

615
00:39:25.913 --> 00:39:27.014
Get it?

616
00:39:28.282 --> 00:39:32.253
Do what you want to do from now on,
and meet someone you love.

617
00:39:34.856 --> 00:39:36.124
Actually...

618
00:39:38.126 --> 00:39:40.461
I wanted to cook.

619
00:39:46.334 --> 00:39:48.669
After listening to you,

620
00:39:50.104 --> 00:39:55.777
I thought there must be at least
one thing I'm good at,

621
00:39:55.943 --> 00:39:59.280
so if I really got the job,

622
00:39:59.747 --> 00:40:02.083
I was going to try my best.

623
00:40:03.184 --> 00:40:04.185
I'm sorry...

624
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.688
for being trapped in the fridge.

625
00:40:09.957 --> 00:40:12.894
Anyway, if you want to try,
you can still learn it now.

626
00:40:14.295 --> 00:40:16.664
I'll support you from afar.

627
00:40:19.066 --> 00:40:21.002
Can you do that from nearby?

628
00:40:27.375 --> 00:40:28.709
Don't go.

629
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:31.879
I realized it when you collapsed.

630
00:40:32.146 --> 00:40:35.416
I'm hopeless without you.

631
00:40:36.551 --> 00:40:40.688
Be my teacher, and teach me
one by one...

632
00:40:43.224 --> 00:40:47.228
beside me.
Teach me little by little.

633
00:40:47.462 --> 00:40:48.896
Teach me how to cook.

634
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.135
Rather than going on a blind date,

635
00:40:55.236 --> 00:40:56.904
meet someone you love.

636
00:40:56.904 --> 00:40:58.105
Of course...

637
00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:03.144
Of course.

638
00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:05.546
Things will get complicated
if you start dating me.

639
00:41:06.414 --> 00:41:08.249
Your father will be against it.

640
00:41:08.249 --> 00:41:11.052
I'm prepared for that.

641
00:41:11.419 --> 00:41:13.321
Once I start, I have to see the end.

642
00:41:14.489 --> 00:41:16.224
If you run away...

643
00:41:16.224 --> 00:41:19.460
I got fired before,
but I never ran away.

644
00:41:23.397 --> 00:41:24.565
Are you sure about this?

645
00:41:24.932 --> 00:41:26.133
I'm...

646
00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:30.204
not sure,

647
00:41:31.005 --> 00:41:35.276
but I'm going to try my best...

648
00:41:35.776 --> 00:41:37.245
to be proud...

649
00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:41.315
to myself and to Dad.

650
00:41:42.049 --> 00:41:43.150
Okay.

651
00:41:45.152 --> 00:41:46.254
I appoint you...

652
00:41:47.188 --> 00:41:49.957
as my favorite pupil from now on.

653
00:41:53.528 --> 00:41:56.664
Thank you, Manager... No.
Master Jung.

654
00:41:58.733 --> 00:42:00.234
Okay.

655
00:42:03.571 --> 00:42:05.172
Thank you.

656
00:42:09.844 --> 00:42:11.012
Who's this?

657
00:42:13.814 --> 00:42:16.250
- Dad.
- Speak louder!

658
00:42:16.684 --> 00:42:17.919
Dad.

659
00:42:18.586 --> 00:42:21.355
Yes. Listen to him from now on,

660
00:42:21.756 --> 00:42:23.324
so that you don't get kicked out.

661
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.382
My sister's life was ruined
because of you.

662
00:42:49.317 --> 00:42:52.587
You should take responsibility
to atone now.

663
00:43:24.151 --> 00:43:25.586
Dad.

664
00:43:26.587 --> 00:43:28.055
My dad.

665
00:43:35.796 --> 00:43:40.001
Are you sure I'll get pregnant if I
put this inside my husband's pillow?

666
00:43:40.001 --> 00:43:42.436
Why can't you trust me?

667
00:43:42.603 --> 00:43:44.939
I paid so much money...

668
00:43:44.939 --> 00:43:48.009
to a very powerful shaman for this,

669
00:43:48.009 --> 00:43:50.378
so just trust me.

670
00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:54.615
Okay. I need to get pregnant before
Father and my husband find out.

671
00:43:55.483 --> 00:43:57.318
How do I use this by the way?

672
00:43:57.585 --> 00:43:59.453
Take all your underwear out.

673
00:43:59.453 --> 00:44:01.856
Since it's pretty big,

674
00:44:01.856 --> 00:44:04.358
make a pocket and put it inside
your panties.

675
00:44:04.358 --> 00:44:05.459
Mom!

676
00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:08.896
I can't put it inside my panties.
It's embarrassing!

677
00:44:13.734 --> 00:44:15.169
You're home.

678
00:44:16.337 --> 00:44:18.706
- I'm home.
- Welcome.

679
00:44:18.706 --> 00:44:21.108
Welcome, my son-in-law.

680
00:44:21.108 --> 00:44:23.110
You look tired.

681
00:44:23.277 --> 00:44:25.980
You can rest now.

682
00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:32.153
Honey. Why do you look so tired
today?

683
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.755
Do you want to take a bath?

684
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:37.458
It's fine. You should be resting.

685
00:44:37.958 --> 00:44:39.460
I'm fine. I'll do it.

686
00:44:44.665 --> 00:44:46.033
I'm sorry, Yeon Ju.

687
00:44:47.168 --> 00:44:48.235
For what?

688
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:52.973
I don't deserve to be your husband.

689
00:44:54.375 --> 00:44:56.043
Things got so complicated...

690
00:44:56.711 --> 00:44:58.345
when you're pregnant.

691
00:44:58.546 --> 00:45:01.982
What's complicated?

692
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.251
Never mind.

693
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.254
It's nothing.

694
00:45:08.255 --> 00:45:09.857
You should only think about
our baby.

695
00:45:12.626 --> 00:45:13.694
Okay.

696
00:45:14.528 --> 00:45:15.730
I will.

697
00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:30.878
That woman.

698
00:45:32.246 --> 00:45:35.249
She used to like me so much.

699
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.953
Why did she get so cold?

700
00:45:41.822 --> 00:45:43.958
She must have
a lot of hard feelings.

701
00:45:44.191 --> 00:45:45.960
Make it concrete.

702
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.261
Sleep together.

703
00:45:47.495 --> 00:45:49.563
The physical distance equals to the
psychological distance.

704
00:45:52.733 --> 00:45:56.237
Yes, Nam Cheol gave me something...

705
00:45:56.704 --> 00:45:58.706
for moments like this.

706
00:46:11.418 --> 00:46:12.553
Let me see.

707
00:46:18.959 --> 00:46:23.130
The medicine will work
faster this way.

708
00:46:23.664 --> 00:46:26.433
This is so much simpler.

709
00:46:26.433 --> 00:46:28.803
Why would I need
expensive Chinese medicine?

710
00:46:40.614 --> 00:46:41.882
Oh, my.

711
00:46:42.683 --> 00:46:46.654
I feel so much better now.

712
00:46:57.298 --> 00:46:58.499
Hong Young Hye.

713
00:46:59.567 --> 00:47:03.604
We won't sleep in separate rooms
from now on.

714
00:47:03.938 --> 00:47:05.105
You should be prepared for this.

715
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.115
Gosh, it's me.

716
00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:50.384
It's Shin Mo, your husband.

717
00:47:51.919 --> 00:47:53.587
What are you doing here?

718
00:47:53.587 --> 00:47:55.856
It's my room.
You're creeping me out.

719
00:47:56.023 --> 00:47:57.825
We're not strangers,

720
00:47:58.092 --> 00:47:59.526
and I'm not a pervert.

721
00:48:00.794 --> 00:48:03.898
I wanted to stay the night with you
as your husband.

722
00:48:03.898 --> 00:48:06.901
Why did you need to make
such a big fuss?

723
00:48:06.901 --> 00:48:09.203
Gosh, never mind.

724
00:48:09.203 --> 00:48:12.339
Never mind. I won't do this.
This is unfair.

725
00:48:12.339 --> 00:48:14.575
Let's just hold hands.

726
00:48:14.575 --> 00:48:17.244
No, don't come near me.

727
00:48:17.244 --> 00:48:19.480
Just... Just stay there.

728
00:48:19.914 --> 00:48:22.650
Don't come near me. Stay there.

729
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:24.752
This is an order.
Don't come near me.

730
00:48:24.752 --> 00:48:27.488
What? An order? Goodness.

731
00:48:27.588 --> 00:48:29.857
Gosh, Young Hye.

732
00:48:29.857 --> 00:48:32.192
You want to do this?

733
00:48:32.192 --> 00:48:33.694
All right, let's do this.

734
00:48:33.694 --> 00:48:34.895
What are you doing?

735
00:48:35.496 --> 00:48:37.631
What are you doing?
I told you not to come near me.

736
00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:39.500
Don't come near me. Don't.

737
00:48:39.934 --> 00:48:42.503
- Oh, my. You want to do this?
- Don't come.

738
00:48:42.503 --> 00:48:43.837
- You do?
- Gosh.

739
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:45.873
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

740
00:48:46.607 --> 00:48:49.276
Hey, Hog Young Hye! Gosh!

741
00:48:49.276 --> 00:48:50.377
Stay right there.

742
00:48:51.478 --> 00:48:53.547
I know what you mean.

743
00:48:53.547 --> 00:48:55.683
But for today,
you should sleep here.

744
00:48:55.683 --> 00:48:57.818
I'll sleep in the living room.

745
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.421
Stop!

746
00:49:02.456 --> 00:49:03.524
If you...

747
00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:06.727
move one step out of this room,

748
00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:08.128
we're done for.

749
00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:09.396
What did you say?

750
00:49:10.164 --> 00:49:11.165
Come here.

751
00:49:11.665 --> 00:49:12.666
Shin Mo.

752
00:49:12.733 --> 00:49:15.936
All problems for couples come from
staying in separate rooms.

753
00:49:16.804 --> 00:49:19.106
We'll stay in the same room
and solve problems here,

754
00:49:19.106 --> 00:49:21.475
even if one snores,
grinds one's teeth,

755
00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:23.644
or farts in this room.

756
00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:25.779
Come here right now.

757
00:49:25.779 --> 00:49:27.147
Gosh.

758
00:49:28.048 --> 00:49:30.584
Aren't you coming? This is an order.

759
00:49:30.818 --> 00:49:32.186
I'm counting to three.

760
00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.355
One.

761
00:49:39.727 --> 00:49:42.129
Shin Mo.

762
00:49:42.129 --> 00:49:45.165
Don't say anything, and come here.
Two.

763
00:49:47.568 --> 00:49:49.003
Are you all right?

764
00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:52.072
Your face is...

765
00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:53.607
What?

766
00:49:54.475 --> 00:49:55.943
What's wrong with my face?

767
00:50:03.417 --> 00:50:04.585
What?

768
00:50:05.552 --> 00:50:08.822
Why is it so red
like a monkey's buttocks?

769
00:50:17.631 --> 00:50:18.999
Shin Mo.

770
00:50:28.275 --> 00:50:31.145
It's all right even if it's red.
Come here.

771
00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:34.515
Three.

772
00:50:39.253 --> 00:50:40.854
Shin Mo!

773
00:50:52.299 --> 00:50:53.667
How are you feeling?

774
00:50:54.902 --> 00:50:56.236
I...

775
00:50:56.236 --> 00:50:58.305
He said he had a headache,

776
00:50:58.305 --> 00:50:59.606
stuffy nose,

777
00:50:59.606 --> 00:51:02.109
and that his heart
was beating really fast.

778
00:51:02.109 --> 00:51:04.845
He had a ministroke a few weeks ago.

779
00:51:04.878 --> 00:51:06.647
Does this have anything
to do with that?

780
00:51:07.614 --> 00:51:10.084
Do you feel any pain down there?

781
00:51:10.184 --> 00:51:11.685
Down there?

782
00:51:12.352 --> 00:51:14.855
You mean down there?

783
00:51:16.457 --> 00:51:18.192
Yes, I do.

784
00:51:18.459 --> 00:51:23.130
It really feels painful there.

785
00:51:25.933 --> 00:51:27.534
Did you have an aphrodisiac?

786
00:51:28.569 --> 00:51:30.838
What are you talking about?

787
00:51:30.838 --> 00:51:32.873
You know what I mean. Viagra.

788
00:51:32.873 --> 00:51:35.476
What are you talking about?

789
00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:37.878
I've never even seen that before.

790
00:51:37.978 --> 00:51:40.514
Why would you need that?

791
00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:41.515
Really?

792
00:51:41.515 --> 00:51:44.318
It seems like a typical side-effect
of aphrodisiacs made in China.

793
00:51:44.318 --> 00:51:46.987
No, that's not it.

794
00:51:46.987 --> 00:51:50.424
I have a contempt for men
who use such things.

795
00:51:50.424 --> 00:51:52.893
How low can they get?

796
00:51:54.294 --> 00:51:56.029
It's a relief then.

797
00:51:56.063 --> 00:51:59.066
If you don't do something quickly
about its side-effects,

798
00:51:59.233 --> 00:52:02.302
in the worst case scenario,
the tissues there could be harmed.

799
00:52:02.336 --> 00:52:05.305
In that case, you need to cut it off
through surgery. Goodbye.

800
00:52:05.305 --> 00:52:07.341
Wait, Doctor.

801
00:52:09.476 --> 00:52:12.546
Wait... Wait a moment.

802
00:52:14.715 --> 00:52:18.285
In fact, I did take it.

803
00:52:19.753 --> 00:52:22.723
The Viagra made in China.

804
00:52:24.091 --> 00:52:25.526
He can't be serious.

805
00:52:31.865 --> 00:52:33.534
(Kevin Miller)

806
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:37.738
I just know that he lived at
an orphanage in Jeolla Province,

807
00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:39.506
and got adopted in the US
when he was six.

808
00:52:41.008 --> 00:52:42.976
Kevin Miller.

809
00:52:45.279 --> 00:52:46.813
What are you looking at?

810
00:52:47.314 --> 00:52:50.083
I'm looking at the picture of
the Chairman of SC Foods.

811
00:52:50.651 --> 00:52:52.986
He's from the US,
and he is so charismatic.

812
00:52:53.086 --> 00:52:54.354
You should take a look too.

813
00:52:54.454 --> 00:52:57.758
I don't want to. I don't like him
because he didn't pick you.

814
00:52:58.859 --> 00:53:00.727
Come downstairs.
Let's have breakfast.

815
00:53:11.004 --> 00:53:12.372
- You're early.
- Yes.

816
00:53:12.873 --> 00:53:14.107
How did you get out?

817
00:53:14.107 --> 00:53:16.376
I lied to them that I was
going to the library.

818
00:53:17.044 --> 00:53:19.913
What is this about?
Why did you tell me to come here?

819
00:53:20.647 --> 00:53:22.049
There's someone we need to meet.

820
00:53:25.986 --> 00:53:27.588
Where's the Chairman's room?

821
00:53:27.688 --> 00:53:29.122
Did you make an appointment?

822
00:53:29.623 --> 00:53:30.691
No.

823
00:53:30.691 --> 00:53:33.493
But I really need to meet him.

824
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:36.997
I'm sorry, but you can't meet him
without an appointment.

825
00:53:37.731 --> 00:53:38.999
Please.

826
00:53:39.566 --> 00:53:42.302
If that's too hard,
just let me make one call.

827
00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:44.738
You should go.

828
00:53:45.339 --> 00:53:46.773
I just need to give this to him.

829
00:53:46.773 --> 00:53:48.275
- Go away.
- What floor is he at?

830
00:53:48.275 --> 00:53:49.776
You should go.

831
00:53:50.143 --> 00:53:52.145
Gosh, please go.

832
00:53:52.145 --> 00:53:53.981
Isn't that the Chairman?

833
00:53:56.883 --> 00:53:58.585
Stop there. Stop!

834
00:53:59.753 --> 00:54:01.455
- Hey.
- I just need a moment.

835
00:54:01.455 --> 00:54:02.723
Do you know where this is?

836
00:54:02.723 --> 00:54:03.924
I just need a moment.

837
00:54:06.593 --> 00:54:07.728
What is this?

838
00:54:09.229 --> 00:54:10.664
I wanted to meet the Chairman.

839
00:54:10.664 --> 00:54:12.399
Please spare some time for us.

840
00:54:12.899 --> 00:54:14.835
You withdrew from the contest
that day.

841
00:54:14.901 --> 00:54:16.169
What are you doing here?

842
00:54:16.169 --> 00:54:17.604
We had a problem.

843
00:54:17.604 --> 00:54:20.274
He nearly died because he was locked
up in the refrigerated warehouse.

844
00:54:20.874 --> 00:54:22.109
The refrigerated warehouse?

845
00:54:24.711 --> 00:54:27.547
There was an accident?

846
00:54:27.648 --> 00:54:30.384
That's all just an excuse.

847
00:54:30.817 --> 00:54:32.586
What are you doing? Take them away.

848
00:54:32.586 --> 00:54:34.488
I'm sorry. Let's go.

849
00:54:34.488 --> 00:54:35.589
Wait.

850
00:54:37.457 --> 00:54:38.859
Take them to my room.

851
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:40.494
Chairman Kevin.

852
00:54:51.004 --> 00:54:52.839
Gosh.

853
00:54:53.106 --> 00:54:55.275
It hurts. Go easy on me.

854
00:54:55.275 --> 00:54:57.944
You should have listened to me.

855
00:54:57.944 --> 00:55:00.147
Why did you get a "Viagrab"?

856
00:55:00.614 --> 00:55:04.051
It's all because of you!

857
00:55:04.284 --> 00:55:06.253
Don't even mention the alphabet
"v" in front of me.

858
00:55:06.353 --> 00:55:08.588
Have you resolved with your wife?

859
00:55:08.588 --> 00:55:09.756
Don't get me started.

860
00:55:10.257 --> 00:55:13.593
She treats me like a pervert now.

861
00:55:14.394 --> 00:55:15.629
What should I do?

862
00:55:16.063 --> 00:55:17.497
I stopped her from the
marriage graduation,

863
00:55:17.497 --> 00:55:19.132
but our relationship's
worse than before.

864
00:55:19.232 --> 00:55:22.235
So work things out with her
rather than trying to seize her.

865
00:55:22.235 --> 00:55:23.503
Just like what you did to
your daughter.

866
00:55:23.603 --> 00:55:27.107
What are you talking about?
I didn't do anything to Ru Ri.

867
00:55:27.374 --> 00:55:28.875
Mok Sin told me you got her...

868
00:55:29.042 --> 00:55:31.211
a studio apartment for her to
get prepared for job interviews.

869
00:55:31.345 --> 00:55:33.613
He said she lives there,

870
00:55:33.613 --> 00:55:35.148
and rarely visits home.

871
00:55:35.282 --> 00:55:37.150
What are you talking about?

872
00:55:37.417 --> 00:55:40.687
I'll shave her head
if she sleeps outside.

873
00:55:40.754 --> 00:55:41.855
Really?

874
00:55:42.255 --> 00:55:43.457
That's not true.

875
00:55:43.457 --> 00:55:46.893
He said he's going to have ramyeon
at her apartment today.

876
00:55:47.027 --> 00:55:48.128
What?

877
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:51.298
Ru Ri went to the library today.

878
00:55:51.665 --> 00:55:54.000
What are you talking about?

879
00:56:01.508 --> 00:56:02.709
What's all this?

880
00:56:02.876 --> 00:56:04.745
It's the meal I prepared that day.

881
00:56:04.745 --> 00:56:07.147
You withdrew. Are you doing this...

882
00:56:07.147 --> 00:56:08.815
to earn our sympathy?

883
00:56:08.915 --> 00:56:12.486
No. I'm not interested
in your sympathy.

884
00:56:12.853 --> 00:56:14.421
Then what are you doing here?

885
00:56:14.855 --> 00:56:18.091
I heard you were adopted to
the US when you were six.

886
00:56:18.759 --> 00:56:20.961
You returned to your motherland
after 46 years.

887
00:56:21.361 --> 00:56:23.897
I wanted to treat you with
a good meal.

888
00:56:23.897 --> 00:56:26.299
You're being so nosy.

889
00:56:28.935 --> 00:56:32.706
So how are you going to treat me
with a good meal?

890
00:56:33.507 --> 00:56:36.109
I think a good memory
is the best taste,

891
00:56:36.743 --> 00:56:40.781
so I want to treat you with the
meals you had when you were young.

892
00:56:41.314 --> 00:56:44.985
These dishes are from
your hometown, Namdo.

893
00:56:53.393 --> 00:56:55.262
This is Beolgyo cockles jeon.

894
00:56:59.566 --> 00:57:01.134
This is Yeonggwang yellow corvina.

895
00:57:06.273 --> 00:57:08.108
This is Jangheung seaweed
fulvescens soup.

896
00:57:08.708 --> 00:57:12.012
Lastly, this is white rice
and a fried egg.

897
00:57:16.483 --> 00:57:18.585
Back then, these dishes were rare.

898
00:57:19.052 --> 00:57:22.956
I assumed they fed you this
before you left.

899
00:57:54.454 --> 00:57:55.589
Nice!

900
00:57:56.256 --> 00:57:57.457
Eat a lot.

901
00:57:57.624 --> 00:58:00.293
Tonight is your last night in Korea.

902
00:58:00.293 --> 00:58:02.128
- Here. Go ahead.
- Okay.

903
00:58:28.989 --> 00:58:30.323
Do you know what this is?

904
00:58:35.962 --> 00:58:37.063
This is...

905
00:58:38.164 --> 00:58:41.167
- Are you...
- Bali in 2010.

906
00:58:41.668 --> 00:58:45.171
Mr. X from Malio Resort?

907
00:59:01.855 --> 00:59:03.023
Yes. What is it?

908
00:59:03.023 --> 00:59:06.126
Did you get Ru Ri
a studio apartment?

909
00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:09.095
No. What are you talking about?

910
00:59:09.095 --> 00:59:12.666
This girl lied to me again.

911
00:59:13.066 --> 00:59:14.734
I'm going to check it now.

912
00:59:15.735 --> 00:59:17.203
Honey. Honey.

913
00:59:18.104 --> 00:59:19.205
Hey, hey.

914
00:59:19.773 --> 00:59:23.543
Ask your son where that
studio apartment is.

915
00:59:23.643 --> 00:59:25.946
- Why?
- Ask him now.

916
00:59:26.813 --> 00:59:29.049
Just ask him for the address.
Don't say anything else.

917
00:59:29.316 --> 00:59:31.051
You're so weird.

918
00:59:36.356 --> 00:59:38.925
I've been searching for you
for six years.

919
00:59:39.626 --> 00:59:43.396
I established this company
to find you.

920
00:59:45.165 --> 00:59:47.167
How do you know him?

921
00:59:48.335 --> 00:59:51.204
I was suffering from dengue fever
alone...

922
00:59:51.705 --> 00:59:54.074
in the hotel room in Bali
seven years ago.

923
00:59:55.108 --> 00:59:57.277
I was sick, and I lost appetite.

924
00:59:57.777 --> 01:00:00.814
I was about to starve to death
because I couldn't even drink water.

925
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:06.486
Then one day, I started getting
delicious Korean food.

926
01:00:06.953 --> 01:00:08.822
That helped me recover.

927
01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:11.524
Are you the one who cooked this?

928
01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:14.461
Yes. I work here as a club mate.

929
01:00:15.295 --> 01:00:17.397
I heard your situation from
the manager.

930
01:00:17.797 --> 01:00:19.899
I volunteered to cook.

931
01:00:25.772 --> 01:00:27.173
What's this bracelet?

932
01:00:27.173 --> 01:00:28.875
My mother gave me the bracelet,

933
01:00:29.009 --> 01:00:31.778
saying that it'll protect me
anywhere I go.

934
01:00:32.612 --> 01:00:34.814
I know how you feel because
I also live alone away from home.

935
01:00:35.515 --> 01:00:37.984
You feel lonely when you're sick.

936
01:00:40.954 --> 01:00:43.957
What's your name?

937
01:00:44.457 --> 01:00:46.126
I'm Jung Tae Yang

938
01:00:46.292 --> 01:00:48.695
(Jung Tae Yang)

939
01:00:51.665 --> 01:00:53.667
I searched for you...

940
01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:55.935
after I returned to the US,

941
01:00:56.302 --> 01:00:58.104
but you already left.

942
01:00:58.338 --> 01:01:00.340
You didn't even leave your address
in Korea.

943
01:01:01.174 --> 01:01:05.245
But we met each other again here.

944
01:01:05.478 --> 01:01:07.047
Thank you for remembering me.

945
01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:11.584
Hire him for
the menu development team.

946
01:01:13.353 --> 01:01:14.454
Chairman Kevin.

947
01:01:14.487 --> 01:01:16.322
Chairman Kevin, you can't do that.

948
01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:18.958
It's not fair. There will be
a lot of oppositions.

949
01:01:18.958 --> 01:01:22.262
The basics of food come from
the heart of chef.

950
01:01:22.796 --> 01:01:25.465
Even if they use the same
ingredients and have similar skills,

951
01:01:25.965 --> 01:01:29.936
the food tastes different
depending on their spirit.

952
01:01:31.004 --> 01:01:34.074
He's sincere to his customers.

953
01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:37.143
He's good enough to be a chef
that I want.

954
01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.045
Hire him.

955
01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:58.865
Why are you staring at me?
Is there something on my face?

956
01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:02.535
You're amazing. You were amazing
seven years ago as well.

957
01:02:02.602 --> 01:02:03.737
You just noticed it?

958
01:02:04.704 --> 01:02:07.507
You'll start working from Monday.
Get ready for it.

959
01:02:07.607 --> 01:02:10.143
Yes. I'm so excited.

960
01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:11.644
I want to scream.

961
01:02:11.644 --> 01:02:13.513
I finally got a job!

962
01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:19.953
I should tell Mom this good news.

963
01:02:24.624 --> 01:02:26.593
Mom. I have good news.

964
01:02:26.593 --> 01:02:27.761
Where are you?

965
01:02:29.462 --> 01:02:30.463
Me?

966
01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:34.834
Of course I'm in the library.

967
01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.069
I have a bad feeling.

968
01:02:36.703 --> 01:02:40.206
Dad called to ask if I got you
a studio apartment.

969
01:02:40.707 --> 01:02:43.042
When I said I didn't,
he said he'll check now.

970
01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:46.312
What?

971
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.015
Myung Rang's studio apartment?

972
01:02:49.749 --> 01:02:51.985
- My goodness.
- Help me, Mom.

973
01:02:51.985 --> 01:02:54.954
Stop Dad from meeting Myung Rang.

974
01:02:58.091 --> 01:02:59.459
Where is it? Give me the address.

975
01:03:03.296 --> 01:03:04.731
Mok Sin told me you got her...

976
01:03:05.165 --> 01:03:07.333
a studio apartment for her to
get prepared for job interviews.

977
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.735
She lives there.

978
01:03:08.735 --> 01:03:12.405
My son said
her eyes are really small.

979
01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:17.877
It's strange.

980
01:03:20.013 --> 01:03:21.881
It's very strange.

981
01:03:25.185 --> 01:03:27.554
