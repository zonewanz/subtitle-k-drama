00:00:15.157 --> 00:00:17.557
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:18.956
How have you been?

4
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.296
How is Ms. Mo?

5
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.566
Who are you?

6
00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:27.366
Don't you remember me?

7
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.807
I'm the doctor from the hospital ship.

8
00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:32.336
Do you know me?

9
00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:35.677
- Ma'am. - Let go of me.

10
00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:44.387
Doctor.

11
00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:47.287
What's going on?

12
00:00:50.357 --> 00:00:51.897
Geun Ja.

13
00:00:57.096 --> 00:01:00.107
Goodness. What's going on?

14
00:01:00.537 --> 00:01:02.967
Hey. Geun Ja...

15
00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:05.876
Ma'am. Who are you?

16
00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:10.277
How do you know my name?

17
00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:13.986
My gosh. Do you have Alzheimer's?

18
00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:16.857
You have a sick mother. What is going on?

19
00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:18.286
Goodness.

20
00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:19.717
- Ma'am. - Geun Ja.

21
00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:21.626
- Ma'am? - Geun Ja.

22
00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:33.236
Change her clothes.

23
00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:35.266
She's severely dehydrated, so get her on an IV first.

24
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.506
Yes, doctor.

25
00:01:37.937 --> 00:01:39.206
Is she an emergency patient?

26
00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:41.046
Yes, her temperature went up to 40℃.

27
00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.646
Her vitals are unstable,

28
00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:44.316
and she's not herself at all.

29
00:01:44.777 --> 00:01:47.587
She hasn't had those symptoms for a long time. I think it's delirium.

30
00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:49.587
Please get her on the monitor first,

31
00:01:49.587 --> 00:01:51.217
and check her vitals again.

32
00:01:51.217 --> 00:01:52.456
Okay.

33
00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.827
Doctor Kwak.

34
00:01:56.456 --> 00:01:58.197
We might need to move her to the ER right away,

35
00:01:58.197 --> 00:01:59.697
so check with the Coast Guard now.

36
00:01:59.697 --> 00:02:01.796
- I've called them already. - And?

37
00:02:01.796 --> 00:02:03.536
It seems like there was a big accident...

38
00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:05.736
where a liner and a fishing boat crashed.

39
00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:09.036
They're all at the scene, so they may not be able to come right away.

40
00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:12.106
The captain says we can set sail now,

41
00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:13.476
so if she can hang on for four hours...

42
00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:16.647
Okay. I'll try to stabilize the patient as soon as possible.

43
00:02:16.647 --> 00:02:17.717
All right.

45
00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:43.006
Hi, doctor.

46
00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:46.476
My dad? Again?

47
00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:52.576
I'm on the island now, so I can't go there right now.

48
00:02:54.017 --> 00:02:55.117
Yes.

49
00:02:57.117 --> 00:02:59.856
Please do. Okay.

50
00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:02.726
Please try to find him, and call me.

51
00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:19.807
- Please stop. - Calm down.

52
00:03:21.807 --> 00:03:23.446
- My gosh. - Doctor Kwak.

53
00:03:23.846 --> 00:03:26.247
The doctor is here. Please get up.

54
00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:29.487
Come on. Please calm down.

55
00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:33.156
What on earth is going on?

56
00:03:33.687 --> 00:03:36.897
What will happen to her now?

57
00:03:36.897 --> 00:03:39.126
I'll tell you the details after we examine her.

58
00:03:39.126 --> 00:03:41.497
That's not going to help her!

59
00:03:42.397 --> 00:03:44.967
There is no medicine for dementia.

(Jaae Rehabilitation Center)

62
00:03:54.307 --> 00:03:55.707
She doesn't have...

63
00:03:59.147 --> 00:04:01.717
It's almost certain that she doesn't have dementia.

64
00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:02.946
What?

65
00:04:03.356 --> 00:04:05.187
She couldn't recognize us,

66
00:04:05.187 --> 00:04:07.457
she talked nonsense,

67
00:04:07.457 --> 00:04:09.386
and she even wet her pants.

68
00:04:09.386 --> 00:04:11.297
But she doesn't have dementia?

69
00:04:11.297 --> 00:04:13.566
She was fine a week ago.

70
00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:16.097
Dementia develops slowly.

71
00:04:16.097 --> 00:04:18.196
It doesn't occur so suddenly like this.

72
00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:19.696
What is it then?

73
00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:23.237
What's wrong with her? Why is she not herself like that?

74
00:04:23.237 --> 00:04:25.206
Since she's showing sudden sets of symptoms,

75
00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:28.547
it's probably delirium rather than dementia.

76
00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:31.316
De... What?

77
00:04:31.316 --> 00:04:34.016
Delirium. Please explain it to her.

78
00:04:34.287 --> 00:04:35.617
Yes, doctor.

79
00:04:35.617 --> 00:04:38.086
She will explain what it is for you.

80
00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:39.987
Please calm down,

81
00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:42.086
and get some rest in the waiting room.

82
00:04:42.256 --> 00:04:44.557
We'll take good care of your friend.

83
00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:50.037
Are you saying she can be normal again?

84
00:04:50.297 --> 00:04:53.066
Can you make her sane again?

85
00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:54.407
I'll do my best.

86
00:04:54.407 --> 00:04:56.506
I don't need you to do your best.

87
00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:59.237
I need you to promise me.

88
00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:03.446
Promise me that you will give me back my friend.

89
00:05:06.247 --> 00:05:07.347
There is...

90
00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:11.287
something to I want to say...

91
00:05:11.287 --> 00:05:14.787
No. There is something I must say to her.

92
00:05:15.526 --> 00:05:17.357
I have to tell her.

93
00:05:18.196 --> 00:05:22.727
So no matter what happens,

94
00:05:23.297 --> 00:05:29.237
please help my friend come back.

95
00:05:36.107 --> 00:05:38.646
Okay. I will do everything I can.

96
00:05:46.256 --> 00:05:49.227
Gosh. Please come this way.

97
00:05:49.227 --> 00:05:51.896
- I'll explain it to you. - Come on.

98
00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:56.526
Her vitals are still very unstable.

99
00:05:58.966 --> 00:06:00.167
I've given her a fever reducer,

100
00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:02.636
but her body temperature won't go down from 40℃.

101
00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:05.407
We have to find the cause of her high fever first.

102
00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.677
What could it be?

103
00:06:06.677 --> 00:06:08.946
She has sudden clouded consciousness and a high fever.

104
00:06:08.946 --> 00:06:11.646
We should suspect cerebromeningitis first.

105
00:06:11.646 --> 00:06:14.617
Don't we have to test her cerebrospinal fluid to verify?

106
00:06:14.787 --> 00:06:16.216
Let's do the simple tests first.

107
00:06:17.787 --> 00:06:19.586
Ma'am. Ma'am.

108
00:06:19.586 --> 00:06:21.626
I want to go home.

109
00:06:21.987 --> 00:06:24.256
My mom's waiting for me.

110
00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:26.766
Let me lift your head.

111
00:06:32.466 --> 00:06:33.636
I'll do that again.

112
00:06:38.307 --> 00:06:39.677
There's no Brudzinski sign.

113
00:06:39.677 --> 00:06:40.807
(The knees should bend)

114
00:06:40.807 --> 00:06:41.876
If it's cerebromeningitis,

115
00:06:42.347 --> 00:06:45.677
the back of her neck would be stiff, but it's soft.

116
00:06:45.677 --> 00:06:48.287
Are you saying we should exclude cerebromeningitis?

117
00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:51.586
Then what's causing the fever?

There's nothing more we can do.

150

We want to report him missing,

The hospital ship's docked three hours away from Geoje,

161
00:09:42.127 --> 00:09:43.927
and we have an emergency patient.

162
00:09:45.657 --> 00:09:47.297
A patient?

00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:50.437
If I don't concentrate on a diagnosis and treatment,

164
00:09:51.437 --> 00:09:53.966
this patient could even end up dead.

165
00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:55.836

00:09:56.637 --> 00:09:57.706
Okay.

00:10:05.616 --> 00:10:06.816
Treat your patient.

170
00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:09.116
Don't worry about anything. You just do that.

171
00:10:09.417 --> 00:10:10.417
Okay, Hyun?

172
00:10:13.057 --> 00:10:14.127
Yes.

173
00:10:15.456 --> 00:10:16.527
Look after...

174
00:10:18.297 --> 00:10:19.427
Dad for me.

175
00:10:41.147 --> 00:10:42.446
Where did you go?

176
00:10:43.417 --> 00:10:45.856
Why can't you just leave your son alone?

177
00:10:53.496 --> 00:10:56.196
(Cruise ship boarding point)

178
00:10:57.167 --> 00:10:58.537
Geun Hee looks like...

179
00:10:59.736 --> 00:11:01.767
she's prickly and cold,

180
00:11:02.566 --> 00:11:05.336
but inside, she's soft like tofu.

181
00:11:07.877 --> 00:11:08.877
Not just that,

182
00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:11.877
she's an amazing cook.

183
00:11:12.647 --> 00:11:16.316
She could pick any odd herb from the field...

184
00:11:17.057 --> 00:11:18.116
and create...

185
00:11:18.586 --> 00:11:20.657
something that tasted special.

186
00:11:22.657 --> 00:11:26.127
She's been looking after her sick mother.

187
00:11:26.726 --> 00:11:28.267
Ever since she moved here,

188
00:11:28.767 --> 00:11:30.336
she went to fields...

189
00:11:31.196 --> 00:11:34.437
and mountains every day to collect herbs.

190
00:11:36.677 --> 00:11:37.706
Herbs?

191
00:11:39.377 --> 00:11:40.377
Yes.

192
00:11:40.377 --> 00:11:42.476
Did she collect herbs in mountains?

193
00:11:42.846 --> 00:11:43.917
Yes.

194
00:11:44.446 --> 00:11:47.047
Why are you asking about that?

195
00:11:53.826 --> 00:11:55.057
What was that about?

196
00:11:56.356 --> 00:11:57.356
I don't know.

197
00:11:59.397 --> 00:12:00.397
I found it.

198
00:12:01.027 --> 00:12:02.897
I think I know what caused the fever.

199
00:12:03.127 --> 00:12:05.267
Every day for the past two weeks,

200
00:12:05.267 --> 00:12:07.407
she collected herbs in the mountains.

201
00:12:08.066 --> 00:12:10.976
Orientia tsutsugamushi tends to cause fevers in the fall.

202
00:12:11.236 --> 00:12:13.076
- It can't be... - Tsutsugamushi?

203
00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:15.076
That's the most likely cause.

204
00:12:20.586 --> 00:12:21.986
It must be on her somewhere.

205
00:12:23.787 --> 00:12:25.856
The site of the bite will be swollen and red.

206
00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:28.986
I found it.

207
00:12:29.856 --> 00:12:31.496
It's really bush typhus.

208
00:12:31.757 --> 00:12:33.996
- Let's run a blood test. - Yes, doctor.

209
00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:35.566
We don't have the reagent.

210
00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:36.937
We do.

211
00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:40.037
Tsutsugamushi is a popular autumn disease.

212
00:12:40.267 --> 00:12:41.966
I ordered the reagent just in case.

213

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

214
00:12:59.787 --> 00:13:02.127
Doctor, the blood test results.

215
00:13:03.057 --> 00:13:04.127
Well?

216
00:13:04.127 --> 00:13:05.897
It is tsutsugamushi disease.

217
00:13:06.096 --> 00:13:07.866
If you ordered the reagent,

218
00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:10.096
then I'm sure you ordered the cure too.

219
00:13:10.937 --> 00:13:12.366
She was very lucky.

220
00:13:12.566 --> 00:13:14.307
You're a great doctor.

221
00:13:14.767 --> 00:13:17.537
Nurse Yoo, give her 200mg of doxycycline orally.

222
00:13:17.836 --> 00:13:18.836
Yes, doctor.

223
00:13:18.836 --> 00:13:20.246
(Doxycycline is an antibiotic)

224
00:13:28.387 --> 00:13:30.816
Tsutsugamushi disease?

225
00:13:31.257 --> 00:13:34.887
Yes. I gave her an antibiotic for now,

226
00:13:35.326 --> 00:13:37.356
but she needs to stay at a hospital.

227
00:13:38.596 --> 00:13:41.196
She'll come back to you healthy and happy.

228
00:13:43.637 --> 00:13:46.167
She'll recognize you and...

229
00:13:55.547 --> 00:13:58.716
She'll be able to hear your story.

230
00:14:00.746 --> 00:14:02.246
What should I do?

231
00:14:03.716 --> 00:14:04.986
I'm so grateful.

232
00:14:06.316 --> 00:14:10.057
How should I repay you for your help?

233
00:14:11.427 --> 00:14:13.826
She'll be fine. Don't worry.

He traveled all his life.

00:15:10.287 --> 00:15:11.356
Again,

237
00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.226
he left without a word.

238
00:15:39.946 --> 00:15:41.547
Did you find something?

239
00:15:42.887 --> 00:15:44.687
Anything that could be a clue?

240
00:15:45.586 --> 00:15:47.427
I'm not sure. Not yet.

241
00:15:49.456 --> 00:15:52.956
I'm not sure if this will be of any help.

242
00:15:53.897 --> 00:15:57.637
A few days ago, he kept asking me to find him something.

243
00:15:58.037 --> 00:15:59.566
He said he had somewhere to go.

244
00:15:59.736 --> 00:16:02.466
What was it? What did he want?

245
00:16:03.407 --> 00:16:07.476
It sounded like "Kkok Ji" or "Kkak Ji".

246
00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:13.586
Is it the name of a pet dog or something?

247
00:16:14.287 --> 00:16:17.657
He was talking in his sleep a while ago.

248

"Come here, Kkak Ji. My beautiful Kkak Ji."

- "This time..." - "When I return,"

It's Kwak Ji, not Kkak Ji.

255
00:16:42.907 --> 00:16:44.476
It's Kwak Ji, Mom.

256
00:16:48.946 --> 00:16:50.417
No.

257
00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:53.726
No, I don't want to be Ji Eun.

258
00:16:53.726 --> 00:16:55.557
Stop crying.

259
00:16:56.157 --> 00:16:58.956
My name isn't Ji Eun.

260
00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:01.267
Ji Eun.

261
00:17:01.366 --> 00:17:05.536
No, that's not my name.

My brother is Kwak Hyun.

Why do I have three syllabi in my name?

266
00:17:13.677 --> 00:17:14.847
Stop crying.

267
00:17:14.847 --> 00:17:17.617
That's not something to complain about.

268
00:17:17.617 --> 00:17:19.577
I won't be Ji Eun.

269
00:17:19.776 --> 00:17:22.387
I don't like that name.

270
00:17:22.516 --> 00:17:24.657
You don't have to be Ji Eun.

271
00:17:24.657 --> 00:17:26.087
Dad.

272
00:17:28.456 --> 00:17:30.397
You don't have to be.

273
00:17:30.627 --> 00:17:34.067
- You can be Kwak Ji. - Kwak Ji?

274
00:17:34.496 --> 00:17:35.827
That's right.

275
00:17:36.296 --> 00:17:38.937
I'm Kwak Sung, and your brother is Kwak Hyun.

276
00:17:39.337 --> 00:17:42.206
You can be Kwak Ji.

277
00:17:42.206 --> 00:17:44.476
You must be happy.

278
00:17:44.476 --> 00:17:47.046
- Your name changed to Kwak Ji. - Kwak Ji.

279
00:17:47.046 --> 00:17:48.847
My goodness.

280
00:17:50.847 --> 00:17:53.546
Kwak Ji.

281
00:17:55.417 --> 00:17:57.817
Do you think Dad went there?

282
00:18:00.387 --> 00:18:02.226
To keep our promise?

283
00:18:40.627 --> 00:18:41.996
You should go now.

284
00:18:42.726 --> 00:18:45.367
- The patient is still... - I'll take care of it.

285
00:18:45.367 --> 00:18:47.536
You saved the patient,

286
00:18:47.536 --> 00:18:48.907
so I'll watch her.

287
00:18:49.607 --> 00:18:51.877
You should go to your dad now.

288
00:18:53.407 --> 00:18:54.776
You can go now.

289
00:19:37.317 --> 00:19:39.056
What are you doing here?

290
00:19:43.226 --> 00:19:45.157
I'm waiting for my daughter.

291
00:19:45.927 --> 00:19:47.067
How old...

292
00:19:48.597 --> 00:19:49.927
is your daughter?

293
00:19:51.736 --> 00:19:52.897
She's six years old.

294
00:20:02.677 --> 00:20:03.847
What is...

295
00:20:04.617 --> 00:20:06.786
the name of your daughter?

296
00:20:07.486 --> 00:20:08.917
Kwak Ji.

297
00:20:13.756 --> 00:20:16.056
"Kwak Ji".

298
00:20:18.827 --> 00:20:21.796
Her real name is Kwak Ji Eun,

299
00:20:22.226 --> 00:20:26.137
but she prefers to be called Kwak Ji.

300
00:20:34.347 --> 00:20:35.847
What's this?

301
00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:42.117
It's a bubble gun. I bought it on my way here.

302
00:20:42.417 --> 00:20:46.516
My daughter loves to play with bubbles.

303
00:20:51.097 --> 00:20:52.256
May I...

304
00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:55.897
try it?

305
00:20:56.837 --> 00:20:58.637
Only if you're gentle with it.

306
00:20:58.996 --> 00:21:00.966
She's quite sensitive.

307
00:21:02.107 --> 00:21:08.607
If you damage it, she might try to attack you.

308
00:21:10.877 --> 00:21:12.417
I'll be careful.

309
00:21:21.827 --> 00:21:24.196
The gun makes bubbles.

310
00:21:25.526 --> 00:21:27.397
It's an interesting toy.

311
00:21:29.327 --> 00:21:32.337
- Don't you think? - Yes.

312
00:21:32.796 --> 00:21:35.206
If all the guns in the world...

313
00:21:36.677 --> 00:21:39.837
make bubbles like this, it would be great.

314
00:21:40.877 --> 00:21:44.016
Then Dad wouldn't have gone to war.

315
00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:51.857
Did your dad...

316
00:21:54.927 --> 00:21:57.296
go to war?

317
00:21:58.196 --> 00:21:59.256
Yes.

318
00:22:01.827 --> 00:22:03.536
Do you miss him?

319
00:23:20.946 --> 00:23:22.147
Are you awake?

320
00:23:22.577 --> 00:23:25.016
Where am I?

321
00:23:25.476 --> 00:23:26.786
You're at a hospital.

322
00:23:34.026 --> 00:23:35.486
Don't you remember?

323
00:23:36.796 --> 00:23:39.056
The doctor found you.

324
00:23:39.256 --> 00:23:42.296
He carried you all the way to the hospital.

325
00:23:43.837 --> 00:23:47.667
Right, I remember.

326
00:23:49.137 --> 00:23:50.776
I think I do.

327
00:23:51.706 --> 00:23:52.907
Do you remember?

328
00:23:53.746 --> 00:23:56.976
Do you remember everything clearly?

329
00:23:59.986 --> 00:24:02.187
That's so surprising.

330
00:24:03.246 --> 00:24:06.587
I thought she had Alzheimer's.

331
00:24:07.026 --> 00:24:09.256
How is she back to normal?

332
00:24:09.256 --> 00:24:12.556
So what? Are you unhappy?

333
00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:15.466
What are you talking about?

334
00:24:17.837 --> 00:24:21.067
- Are you okay? - Of course, she isn't.

335
00:24:22.206 --> 00:24:25.036
She can't even take care of herself.

336
00:24:26.377 --> 00:24:29.776
Just look at her. She isn't okay.

337
00:24:29.776 --> 00:24:31.546
Who is the one to talk?

338
00:24:33.446 --> 00:24:37.016
Do you think you look better than me?

339
00:24:42.387 --> 00:24:43.696
I'm sorry.

340
00:24:45.226 --> 00:24:48.627
- I'm sorry, Choon Soon. - Sorry about what?

341
00:24:48.627 --> 00:24:50.937
You've been sick,

342
00:24:51.637 --> 00:24:53.837
but I never came to visit you.

343
00:24:53.837 --> 00:24:55.536
Forget it.

344
00:24:56.167 --> 00:25:00.206
Let me explain, Choon Soon.

345
00:25:02.506 --> 00:25:04.347
I was afraid.

346
00:25:06.276 --> 00:25:08.786
I was afraid that...

347
00:25:09.917 --> 00:25:11.256
I'd become like you.

348
00:25:12.887 --> 00:25:14.087
To be honest,

349
00:25:17.056 --> 00:25:18.157
I...

350
00:25:21.796 --> 00:25:23.637
I don't live in Seoul.

351
00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:30.877
I don't live in Seoul.

352
00:25:32.337 --> 00:25:33.806
I'm a diver...

353
00:25:35.877 --> 00:25:39.246
just like you in the East Sea.

354
00:25:45.157 --> 00:25:47.056
It's been over 20 years...

355
00:25:47.956 --> 00:25:49.887
since I separated from my husband.

356
00:25:51.397 --> 00:25:55.296
I don't know what to do with my only child.

357
00:25:58.996 --> 00:26:00.506
After getting divorced,

358
00:26:01.766 --> 00:26:03.577
I started diving again.

359
00:26:05.377 --> 00:26:07.806
Perhaps I'm meant to be a diver.

360
00:26:09.177 --> 00:26:11.516
Becoming a diver again...

361
00:26:12.117 --> 00:26:13.546
wasn't difficult.

362
00:26:14.786 --> 00:26:19.387
I started to save money little by little,

363
00:26:19.956 --> 00:26:22.286
but my son squandered it all.

364
00:26:23.127 --> 00:26:24.296
Now,

365
00:26:25.496 --> 00:26:28.226
he thinks my mom will die soon.

366
00:26:29.196 --> 00:26:31.266
He wants to send her to a sanatorium...

367
00:26:31.966 --> 00:26:34.236
and sell her house.

368
00:26:35.506 --> 00:26:37.607
I have to work hard...

369
00:26:39.437 --> 00:26:41.806
to stop him from doing that,

370
00:26:43.347 --> 00:26:45.917
and I got worried that I might get sick like you.

371
00:26:50.917 --> 00:26:52.087
Geun Ja...

372
00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:55.526
No. Geun Hee.

373
00:26:57.026 --> 00:26:58.296
It's Geun Ja.

374
00:27:01.996 --> 00:27:05.796
Just call me Geun Ja.

375
00:27:06.036 --> 00:27:09.736
A new name couldn't change the fact that I'm a bumpkin.

376
00:27:22.317 --> 00:27:23.917
I'm sorry.

377
00:27:45.937 --> 00:27:49.147
All right. Shall we dive in together now? It's been a while.

378
00:27:49.276 --> 00:27:50.746
How long has it been?

379
00:27:51.317 --> 00:27:54.087
It's been 30 years. 30 years.

380
00:27:56.657 --> 00:27:58.917
I'm all set. Let's go.

381
00:27:59.887 --> 00:28:02.387
- Are you good to go? - I am.

382
00:28:03.857 --> 00:28:06.226
Let's go then. Here we go.

383
00:28:49.607 --> 00:28:50.937
I told...

384
00:28:52.077 --> 00:28:53.806
Seung Won about Dad.

385
00:28:54.847 --> 00:28:55.976
What did he say?

386
00:28:56.546 --> 00:28:57.946
He says he's disappointed...

387
00:28:58.317 --> 00:29:02.446
that I didn't tell him sooner and sorry he couldn't earn my trust.

388
00:29:03.756 --> 00:29:05.016
That's good.

389
00:29:06.516 --> 00:29:07.687
It doesn't look like...

390
00:29:08.556 --> 00:29:10.827
Dad can walk me down the aisle, right?

391
00:29:13.157 --> 00:29:15.996
I'm so disappointed. I want to...

392
00:29:17.196 --> 00:29:19.736
hold his hand and walk down the aisle.

393
00:29:23.377 --> 00:29:24.506
You can...

394
00:29:25.637 --> 00:29:27.177
hold my hand instead.

395
00:29:29.077 --> 00:29:32.347
I will ask for your father's blessing today.

396
00:29:32.877 --> 00:29:34.317
So why don't we...

397
00:29:36.486 --> 00:29:39.986
hold each other's hands and walk down the aisle together?

398
00:29:46.526 --> 00:29:48.327
It's great to finally meet you, Mr. Kwak.

399
00:29:48.696 --> 00:29:51.766
My name is Han Seung Won.

400
00:29:55.306 --> 00:29:57.407
I came to ask for your blessing.

401
00:30:05.917 --> 00:30:08.387
Please let me marry Ji Eun.

402
00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:12.117
I will love her and look after her...

403
00:30:12.117 --> 00:30:14.756
when we're happy or sad.

404
00:30:17.496 --> 00:30:19.627
Would you give us your blessing?

405
00:30:28.667 --> 00:30:29.837
Kwak Ji.

406
00:30:33.177 --> 00:30:35.177
Do you like this guy?

407
00:30:39.417 --> 00:30:40.546
Dad.

408
00:30:40.546 --> 00:30:42.847
I can't really say I like him.

409
00:30:44.917 --> 00:30:46.056
Dad.

410
00:30:46.956 --> 00:30:48.157
You thief.

411
00:31:25.381 --> 00:31:26.681
(Episode 28 will air shortly.)
