EPISODE 2

10
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.110
One two three

11
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.960
OK. 
Let's properly do the revenge.

12
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.930
I'm back from school.

13
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.240
Ah... This... was fallen on the yard.
If you don't need, will I throw it away?

14
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.790
The doll was broken.

15
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.380
Wow she treats me like an invisible man.

[Buam-Dong Coffee Social Club]

17
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.600
Then...

18
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.800
shall we try starting?

19
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.920
Revenge? Right now? Immediately?

20
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.000
Self-introductions.

21
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.400
Since the Buam-Dong Revenge Social Club is having its first meeting,

22
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.370
the members should introduce themselves first.

23
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.360
Having said that, that Revenge Social name… that is really a mouthful.

24
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.870
Shortening it, Avengers Club.

25
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.740
Avengers Club?

26
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.570
Oh, that sounds okay. 
It sounds a lot better.

27
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.970
Then starting with me. 
I’m Kim Jung Hye. I'm 36.

28
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.340
I’m Lee Mi Sook. 
I’m 42 years old.

29
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.020
My name is Hong Do Hee.

30
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.940
Sorry. I’m sorry.

31
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.600
I run a stall at the Buam Market. 
Hong Do Fish.

32
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.360
So, everyone calls me Hong Do, Hong Do, 
but having to say my own name

33
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.200
for the first time in a long time, 
it feels very awkward.

34
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.110
I feel that way, too.

35
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.710
And your age?

36
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.280
Different to how it may look, I seem to be the oldest. I’m 45 in my prime.

37
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.960
However, you both look like 
the world’s most refined,

38
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.240
to whom and what revenge are you saying that you are going to do.

39
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.250
You look as if you have never ever had to deal with an unfair situation.

40
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.530
Husbands.

41
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.000
Ah… Cheating. Violence.

42
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.360
How did you know?

43
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.260
Ay… of course, you can just tell.

44
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.910
Evil jerks. So, who is “cheating” and 
who is “violent”? Hm?

45
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:56.910
“Cheating”?

46
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.000
What in the world. You look as if 
you would fly away if someone blows

47
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.640
on you too hard. 
Where is there to hit you anyway?

48
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.200
However, the two of you, 
when and how did you meet?

49
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.760
We met a few days ago 
through our husbands.

50
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.110
What?! A few days ago?! 
So, the two of you

51
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.110
don’t really know each other 
that well either?

52
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.990
Excu… excuse me. 
Your voice, please.

53
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.930
If we all have the same objective, 
isn’t that enough?

54
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.930
It’s not as if it’s a family gathering 
or anything.

55
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.040
That is true, I guess.

56
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.600
However, why you made such an offer to me, I’m curious about that.

57
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.810
Rather than two, 
isn’t three better?

58
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.560
Huh?

59
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.400
Since it looked as if you would want to get revenge on that woman.

60
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.550
Is that all?

61
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.070
Is something else necessary?

62
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.450
Well, that… that is… 
it isn’t like that.

63
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.040
I guess if you say that this is fate, then 
we have to look at it as fated.

64
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.630
You said the settlement amount 
was 20 million won.

65
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.850
There is no way. She was just throwing out numbers to be mean. She’s evil really.

66
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.000
What is this?

67
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.390
The settlement money. Use this to at least settle that matter first…

68
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.280
Wait wait wait wait wait. 
Just one minute. What did you say?

69
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.110
Why are you being like this?

70
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.790
What do you mean “why”? You’re pushing such a large sum of money to a stranger…

71
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.980
It’s not a large sum of money to me. 

72
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.940
And, it’s not to a stranger. Now, we are all Avengers Club members

73
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.640
and we agreed to seek 
revenge together.

74
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.280
Okay, then.

75
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.880
Let’s be frank.

76
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:49.520
I did come here because I was furious, but I don’t think I can trust the two of you yet.

77
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.730
To a person that you’ve met 
for the first time,

78
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.730
you say let’s get revenge together and shove such a large sum of money.

79
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.020
Whether you’re not trying to scam me or something is something I keep wondering.

80
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.600
I’m not a scam artist.

81
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.260
I… I am not.

82
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.050
Yes, you look that way.

83
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.130
What in the world is the problem? 
You need money immediately after all.

84
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.230
Since I have it, I’m just saying 
that I’ll give it to you is all.

85
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.910
Look here. Starting the other day, you keep treating me like a beggar…

86
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.410
My husband has brought the child that he had with another woman into our house.

87
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.580
Wh… what?

88
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.020
Come in!

89
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.840
Ah. Soo Gyum?

90
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.480
Nice to meet you. 
I'm Yi Soo Gyum.

91
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.480
Nice to meet you. 
Have a seat.

92
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.560
You resembled your father. 
You're very tall.

93
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.480
I'm a highschool senior of you two's fathers.

94
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.100
Ah. I've heard it from father.

95
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.520
Soo Gyum, you just moved, 
it must feel awkward in everything.

96
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.640
So Yeon, please teach him well.

97
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.210
Soo Gyum, think she is your sister. 
Be comfortable to her.

98
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.400
Because of the relationship 
with your fathers,

99
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.260
I called you to introduce to each other.

100
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.960
Thank you.

101
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.960
You guys look good.

102
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.410
Hey. By the way...

103
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.840
Are you by chance...

104
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.920
This isn’t revenge. 
This is a matter for a divorce.

105
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.400
That isn’t possible. That...

106
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.700
Why isn’t it possible?

107
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.810
It was a marriage to connect 
two families.

108
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.940
How great a family do you belong to that you can’t even get a divorce.

109
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.570
HaeRan Construction. 
And, my family is GeoNa.

110
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.710
G..g…R…really that Geo…GeoNa?

111
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.040
There really is such a thing as 
a chaebol daughter.

112
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.220
Oh, so, at least when you suffer 
something like that

113
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:24.000
from the husband you had trusted, 
then you probably want to kill him.

114
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.070
Yes. However…

115
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.590
Why would you kill a person?

116
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.190
Huh?

117
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.040
Then, you will go to jail.

118
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.350
Yes, that’s right.

119
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.720
So why would you do something 
like that?

120
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.990
That’s right! I also don’t want 
that kind of a revenge.

121
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.970
So, something that doesn’t run foul of the law, so, that is… just a little bit,

122
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.640
without anyone knowing. Doing the same kinds of things that the bad guys do,

123
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.410
I don’t want to do that kind of revenge.

124
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.120
I agree.

125
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.470
I thought you said that this gathering 
was to take revenge?

126
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.460
That’s right.

127
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.550
Then what revenge, and how are you 
saying that you want to do it?

128
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.910
From now on, we have to 
think about it.

129
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:21.520
<i>What is this? These people have no clue. Maybe I’m just getting involved with the wrong people…</i>

130
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.950
<i>Maybe I shouldn’t have said that I would do it. Maybe, even just now, I should quit…</i>

131
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.240
<i>These people, is it really okay to trust them?</i>

132
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.870
Yah! If you’re finished, then you should have just stayed away longer.

133
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.340
Why did you come back so early?

134
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.030
Because I wanted to see you.

135
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.420
Oh, you!

136
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.240
Oh wait a minute. 
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

137
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.390
Hey you!

138
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.070
You’re the one who rolled down the stairs, 
aren’t you?

139
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:55.820
Yes?

140
00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.590
Yesterday. Didn’t you roll down the stairs? 
It was you, right?

141
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:01.720
Yes, that’s right.

142
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.810
Are you okay now?

143
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.250
Yes. However, who are…?

144
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.470
That’s a relief.

145
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.910
- He’s the senior who called 911. 
 - Huh?

146
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.330
Sunbae-nim! (This title means “senior person” and is a term of respect.)

147
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.520
Thank you.

148
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.060
If you’re grateful, then you can just 
buy me some bread later.

149
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.860
Ow. Ow. Fishy smells!

150
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.620
Ow. Ow. Fishy smells!

151
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:35.070
Let’s go together! 
I said let’s go together.

152
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.680
- Then walk faster. 
 -No.

153
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.260
-Oppa! 
 -What are you doing here.

154
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.870
Before the rain starts, I have to go to work. So, for today, just till here.

155
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.450
I also…

156
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.610
But, this is the start.

157
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.100
- As for the bill, then I’ll…
- I’ll do it.

158
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.580
Just a minute. Wait. Wait.

159
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.580
Today, let’s all pay individually for ourselves.

160
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.580
And, for next time, we can start 
a group fund or something.

161
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.480
Aigoo you're babbling over nonsense.

162
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.480
Ah I don't know, just hang up!

163
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.880
One Americano is out.

164
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.810
What's it?

165
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.440
- Yeh? 
-I'm already boiling with anger.

166
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.360
Do I look like drinking this hot thing?

167
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.330
Well, you ordered it.

168
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.380
What are you talking about? 
I ordered Americano Ice!

169
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.230
No you didn't. You ordered... 
- Hey!

170
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.710
Since a while ago, you made me wait and 
went away for your own business.

171
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.050
Now, what are you saying?

172
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.880
What kind of store this is!

173
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.590
That was... 
I got an urgent call of nature.

174
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.290
I am sorry.  
-You said you're urgent?

175
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.520
How dare you don't know 
when customers come.

176
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.560
This jerk, you never pee?

177
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.560
So I put it on here and went.

178
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.030
So are you saying you did well?

179
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.870
You just put this piece on?

180
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.740
You're just a part timer and are you 
arguing to a customer?

181
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.750
I will report it to your boss and 
 cut you out!

182
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.720
You wait.

183
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.720
You shove it down.

184
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.720
<i>Ah really.</i>

185
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.750
That bastard.

186
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.720
Don't stop me.

187
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.720
Are you okay?

188
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.720
Where is she? 
Shall we call her?

189
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.670
Hey. Turn off the phone. 
Turn it off.

190
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.200
What are you doing here?

191
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.420
Oh, I’m sorry.

192
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.280
<i>What’s this? What’s this?</i>

193
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.530
<i>Ouch! Ouch!</i>

194
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.920
Revenge? Whatever.

195
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.080
When you are such scaredy cats, what kind of revenge can we do?

196
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.080
Well she ran away with us.

197
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.080
Eh? What did you say?

198
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.640
That’s right. 
Will we be able to do well?

199
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.760
Why?

200
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.620
It’s just that, with just an inconsequential opponent as that, we couldn’t do it properly.

201
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.820
We properly got back at him.

202
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.770
Oh, for the first one, it wasn’t 
completely satisfying.

203
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.770
We’ll just leave that one as it is.

204
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.770
It’s the ones going forward that’s important…

205
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.820
Oh, right there in front. Please stop the car there.
-Okay.

206
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.950
It’s going forward that’s important…

207
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.720
It's fresh.

208
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.400
Distinguished figure. 
Two silver hairtail from Jeju, $30.

209
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.910
Ajumma, your things are always fresh. 
I trust you and buy.

210
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.910
Thank you. Have it deliciously and come again.
 - Yes

211
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.640
Thanks to the beauties sitting there, 
It's selling well.

212
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.530
What were we talking about?

213
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.660
How about going to trial? 
Wouldn't it be better?

214
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.080
Because it wasn't all my Hee Soo's fault?

215
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.370
I already thought about it.

216
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.040
By any chance, if the trial goes wrong, 
what should I do?

217
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.680
Agreement is the best way indeed.

218
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.010
Since he is a minor, even if he loses.

219
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.980
Won't it be just monetary penalty?

220
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.300
Even so, but the record is left anyway.

221
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.280
It may still harm his future.

222
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.800
You're right

223
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.880
It's difficult.

224
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.050
Ah.

225
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.040
Lawyer Yim?

226
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.350
I have a favor to ask.

227
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.510
That sounds good.

228
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.160
Yes. 
Then I will call you again.

229
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.860
I called a lawyer.

230
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.820
That's great!

231
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.680
Oh, oh! Thank you!

232
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.410
Definitely you're in another level.

233
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.250
By the way, this...

234
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.210
Yes.

235
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.390
One more cup of this.

236
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.890
That's your third cup.

237
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.480
Why is it so delicious?

238
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:52.170
Aigoo, our Madam is charmed by the taste 
of instant coffee.

239
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.190
I will buy. 
How much is it?

240
00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.550
Four cups please. 
You two have one more cup.

241
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.480
Sook!

242
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.470
Give us one more cup of coffee.

243
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.090
Unnie, just a moment. After I take group customers.
 - Okay.

244
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.060
It's 50 cents.

245
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.420
Eh?

246
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.430
She is in another level.

247
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.090
Hello.

248
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.090
Okay.

249
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.190
We should have a family dinner before I leave.

250
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.480
I see.

251
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.660
I should go now.

252
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.740
Me too. It's time to prepare dinner.

253
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.210
Wait, wait a moment!

254
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.760
Don't give it to the guys you hate.

255
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.640
What's this?

256
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.680
It's not from Jeju. 
It's hairtail from Mokpo.

257
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.480
But it tastes no less good.

258
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.160
Don't ask me to give you everyday 
because it's so delicious.

259
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.210
How much is it?

260
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.830
$500.

261
00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.510
Ahh! No! Aigoo...

262
00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.510
Go! Go!

263
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.630
I'll eat well.
 - Yes

264
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.420
Sook, cancel the coffee!

265
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.130
Excuse me, are you getting off?

266
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.040
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.890
What the hell?

268
00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.120
Ah sorry.

269
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.080
Are you a pervert or what?

270
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.120
Hey, that was too harsh.

271
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.080
Why do you touch someone else's stuff?

272
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.280
No, it's not like that.
 Whenever I see you, you're putting it into your ears.

273
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.660
So I was curious what songs 
Seoul kids listen to.

274
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.310
We've met only few times.

275
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.840
Didn't you hear what the principal said?

276
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.720
He told us to be sociable to each other well.

277
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:22.880
I don't like to.

278
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.160
It may burst on your ears.

279
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.630
Are you dissatisfied to the world?

280
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.480
Why are you following me?

281
00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.120
I'm on my way home.

282
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.560
So irritating.

283
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.240
Help yourself.

284
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.220
Ah yes.

285
00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.960
Ah that's mother's seat. 
Sit down here.

286
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.700
Ah!

287
00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.430
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.640
Sorry!

289
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.370
Wow it's like a luxurious restaurant.

290
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.310
Eat a lot!

291
00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.440
You too.

292
00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.510
I'll eat well!

293
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.720
Ah right. 
When do you leave tomorrow?

294
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.110
At dawn.

295
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.060
I won't able to see you before I leave.

296
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.990
I envy you going to a trip abroad.

297
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.970
I've never been a plane, even once.

298
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.120
I'm not going to play, you punk.

299
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.260
Then father, are you managing the foreign part 
of the business too?

300
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.820
Yes. 
Your grandfather is sick.

301
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.490
Anyway, I will manage all. 
I should keep checking it ahead.

302
00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.440
He didn't announce who will inherit, yet.

303
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.590
It's just a formal procedure.

304
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.900
Well, I should be responsible as an owner 
and raise my specialty.

305
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.160
Madam, when did you buy this fresh hairtail?

306
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.120
Hairtail?

307
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.250
You've worked hard.

308
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.800
Yes, please eat it deliciously.

309
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.110
I love hairtail very much.

310
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.690
I'll eat it well.

311
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.560
It's so delicious.

312
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.670
While I’m away, you two try to get closer.

313
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.480
Yes, understood.

314
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.600
Then let's meet right there, Mr. Lawyer.

315
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:38.760
Yes.

316
00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:58.650
Oh, geez, this woman. 
She has no sense of timekeeping either.

317
00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.120
Hee Soo’s mother?

318
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.700
Oh, here you are.

319
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.470
I seem to be a little late. 
Sorry.

320
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.370
What’s wrong? 
You look a little shocked.

321
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.370
W..what? No one is shocked.

322
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.920
So... when are you going to deposit it?

323
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.920
It’s better to finish this as soon as possible.

324
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.250
First, I want to re-determine the settlement amount.

325
00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.250
$20,000 is too much.

326
00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.150
After completely breaking the arm of 
another’s beloved son,

327
00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.500
Is that something that you can say?

328
00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.420
If one is a person, one should have a conscience 
and a sense of shame.

329
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.600
How dare you try to negotiate?

330
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.600
I can’t reduce it by even one cent.

331
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.220
<i>I knew you would do this, 
so I started with a high number.</i>

332
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.220
At first, you said $10,000.

333
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.400
That is already high, but do you think that 
$20,000 makes any sense?

334
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.800
What? 
When did I?

335
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.550
You can’t even understand a person’s words correctly 
and what are you trying to pull?

336
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.550
Look here. 
Perpetrators’ mother.

337
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.020
You don’t seem to understand the 
situation here very well,

338
00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.020
so shall we just go to the police student?

339
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.020
That Jung Wook student hurt his arm, 
I feel badly about that.

340
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.950
And, having decided to settle, it’s only right 
that I give you the settlement money.

341
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:44.420
However, we have to calculate it appropriately.

342
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:49.850
Right now. What is this attitude? 
What could it be?

343
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.470
$10,000 is not reasonable.

344
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.400
She seems to be using her child 
to make some money.

345
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.670
To a person like that, you have to take 
a forceful line.

346
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.670
Even if you were sued,

347
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.500
you have the right to ask for a reconsideration 
of a reasonable amount.

348
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.800
Really?

349
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.950
There is no way that the other side 
doesn’t know that.

350
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:15.520
Using the threat of suing you, she’s calculatingly trying to get 
a lot more settlement money from you.

351
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.100
Have you seen the broken arm?

352
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.000
You haven’t seen it, have you?

353
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.500
That could be a lie also, so ask her to show you 
the diagnosis first. The diagnosis.

354
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.900
Oh, I didn’t think about that. Diagnosis.

355
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.900
Diagnosis. Okay.  
Please show me the diagnosis.

356
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.320
Make her look fashionable.

357
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:34.570
How much more? 
This is already pretty fashionable.

358
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:39.720
The settlement money is the bill for the treatment, 
school attendance, and consolation money.

359
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.550
No. It’s losses from missing school.

360
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:47.670
Losses from missing school.

361
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:53.550
The settlement money consists of the treatment bill, 
losses from missing schools, and consolation.

362
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.600
You know that, right?

363
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.600
Even if you doubled the number, 
it wouldn’t be $10,000.

364
00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.270
How much was the bill for the treatment? 
And, will you show me the diagnosis?

365
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.750
<i>What is this?</i>

366
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.270
<i>Why is this witch suddenly being like this?</i>

367
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.750
Why do I have to show you a diagnosis?

368
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.950
It seems as if because of the money, you’ve become 
unreasonable and trying to run roughshod,

369
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.920
but if you’re going to be like this, then settlement money or whatever,
there is a way to just make it as if it never happened.

370
00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.550
Understand the situation that you’re in properly, perpetrator!

371
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.420
Sue me. Go ahead and sue me.

372
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.820
More strongly.

373
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.250
Go ahead and sue me.
More comfortably.

374
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.670
Go ahead and sue me.

375
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.170
More forcefully.

376
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.450
Go ahead and sue me!

377
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.900
I’ve finished understanding the situation. 
Go ahead and do it.

378
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.100
What?

379
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.120
Suing. 
Go ahead and do it.

380
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.220
Listen here.

381
00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.470
It was your son’s unprovoked violent attack.

382
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.500
My son didn’t do anything.

383
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.750
Go ahead and allege that at court.

384
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.820
Allege? This is a fact! Fact!

385
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.220
That is for a judge to determine.

386
00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.600
Yah!

387
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.300
The fact that your side by using defamatory remarks 
actually caused the accident,

388
00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:03.350
the fact you threatened me trying to get the unbelievable amount of $20,000 
as settlement money, I’m going to reveal all of it in court.

389
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:07.820
And, I’m going to countersue for mental distress.

390
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.170
Then either you’ll be punished, 
or at least the settlement money will be reduced, don’t you think?

391
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:15.320
So, either lower the settlement amount or sue me

392
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.970
and try getting into a dogfight with me!

393
00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.950
<i>This fishy person. What is she 
relying on to act this way?</i>

394
00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:31.550
Give in. Please. 
Please give in.

395
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.920
Because it was so pitiful that you are suffering 
to sell fish in order to make a living,

396
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.920
I was thinking of lowering the settlement amount,

397
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.050
but your audacity is just piercing the sky!

398
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.100
It’s an act of rudeness, 
disdaining any benefits!

399
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.100
If that is your wish, 
then I’ll do that.

400
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.100
Go to trial! 
Let’s go to trial then!

401
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.620
<i>Oh no, this isn’t what I wanted.</i>

402
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.150
Omo. Hello. 
We meet again.

403
00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:11.070
Omo. Madam. Hello.

404
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.620
Omo! Sister Do Hee!

405
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.320
How is it that we meet again here?

406
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.700
Oh, yeah, Jung Hye. 
It’s good to see you.

407
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.900
This fishy pers…  I mean… How is it… 
Do you and this person know each other?

408
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:31.620
Yes, of course, we know each oth… 
no, she’s a very close sister.

409
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.670
Ah.

410
00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.850
Vice President Hwang is also doing well, isn’t he?

411
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.520
No. No, I mean yes, yes, yes. 
He’s dong very well. Yes, yes, yes.

412
00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.150
Thanks to the Managing Director, 
we’re also doing very well.

413
00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.150
Thank you so much for asking after him.

414
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.700
Oh, by the way, you said that you had been having 
some difficulty these days, didn’t you?

415
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.720
Huh? Oh. Yes. 
That’s right.

416
00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.720
Tell me later what the problem is.

417
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.720
I’ll do everything I can to help you.

418
00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.050
Between us, there isn’t anything we can’t talk about. 
Isn’t that right?

419
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.820
That’s right. I’ll do that. 
Jung Hye.

420
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.370
Oh, how do the two of you know each other…?

421
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.000
Oh, that is…

422
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
That is… our children… friends.

423
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.820
They’re school friends. So, we’ve just been having a 
parents of students meeting right now.

424
00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.970
That’s right, isn’t it, Hee Su’s mother?

425
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.970
After you’re done talking, come and see me 
before you go, sister. Okay?

426
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.900
Then...

427
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.650
<i>We were too obvious. Has she caught on 
that we had planned this?</i>

428
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.570
<i>What is this? How can this person… 
with the Madam…</i>

429
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:52.420
Oh. You’ve dribbled a little.

430
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.000
That’s fine.

431
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.500
Then, shall we finish our talk?

432
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.650
If you insist on suing like that…

433
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.370
When did I…?!

434
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.720
You can’t just misunderstand a person’s intentions like that.

435
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.020
Accept a drink! 
Accept a drink.

436
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:45.720
Oh, that woman’s face… 
it was really a shame that only I saw it.

437
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.720
I also saw it.

438
00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.050
Now, you just need to have the lawyer 
submit the settlement, right?

439
00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:55.620
Yes. Then it’s really over. Over. 
Over. Over. Over.

440
00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.850
However, the settlement amount…

441
00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:01.550
Oh that amount. I’m also a woman who has 
at least $5,000.

442
00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.550
Here. Cheers!

443
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:04.770
Cheers!

444
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.670
Oh, however, Vice President Hwang? 
Who is that?

445
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.020
That woman’s husband. 
The Managing Director is my husband.

446
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:20.800
Ahh. So, in that case, the wives are in a pecking order 
of their own also.

447
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.550
Oh wow, this is really a couple who are 
identical in power.

448
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:29.550
Then, in that case, 
shall we properly celebrate?

449
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.630
However, this place is…

450
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.630
Where shall we go? To a place that’s really nice.

451
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.040
Selton? Charriot?  (Expensive hotels)

452
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.040
- What are those?
- Hotels.

453
00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.270
- I’ll make reservations.
 -  Oh wait! Wait a moment.

454
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.380
I know a totally fantastic place.

455
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.160
Oh, what in the world!

456
00:32:51.488 --> 00:32:59.650
Oh… careful, careful. Aigoo. Our Madam.
What is so fascinating now?

457
00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.500
<i>-Don’t. No.
-I told you it was her.</i>

458
00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.870
Hee Soo’s mother. Is today a special day?

459
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.760
What kind of a day is it that you’re dressed up so much?

460
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.000
It’s a good day.
I went to someplace nice.

461
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.540
Who is that?

462
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.540
She’s an important person who has come.

463
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.880
<i>Leave quickly. Go!</i>

464
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.200
Ay, venomous women, how did they even
notice we were here.

465
00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.300
Here. Please come in.

466
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.860
Jung Hye, let’s go in.

467
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.800
Hurry and come on in.
Here. Here.

468
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.760
Jung Hye.

469
00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.600
<i>She’s fascinated with something.
Fascinated.</i>

470
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.060
What do you think?

471
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.060
It’s more fun than a hotel room, isn’t it?

472
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.980
Today, I’ll serve our noble ladies a feast
to stuff yourselves. Come on in.

473
00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.100
Oh, that’s spicy.

474
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
That. That.

475
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.300
Oh, okay.

476
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.120
Why?
Does it look strange?

477
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.120
It’s pretty.

478
00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:16.180
Since Madam is wearing it, even a pair of cheap
$5 trousers totally look stylish.

479
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.320
Does it?

480
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.960
Here. Let’s start a party now!

481
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.960
Oh, in the refrigerator, there is some alcohol, please get it.

482
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.880
Okay.

483
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.220
<i>Madam! What are you doing?</i>

484
00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.220
<i>Please give us some alcohol here.
Some alcohol!</i>

485
00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.060
Let’s eat today and die!

486
00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.780
No. Let’s take revenge!

487
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.480
Accept this.

488
00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.220
Avengers Club, fighting!

489
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.480
Fighting!

490
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:25.460
Oh right. I have to mix in the soju.
Yah, let’s mix in the soju.

491
00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.460
Have you ever had this? So-maek? So-maek?
**(So-mek is soju and maekju, which is the Korean word for beer.)

492
00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.540
No, I haven’t.

493
00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.120
You haven’t? 
What in the world?

494
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:32.750
You've worked hard.

495
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.130
Hello Sunbae!
 - Ah you startled me.

496
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.360
The stairs?
 - Yes, right.

497
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.340
What's up?

498
00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.180
To buy you bread.

499
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.360
Hey I was just joking.

500
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.380
No. I really want to buy bread for you.

501
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.800
But, how did you know my class?
 - At the cafeteria.

502
00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.460
I saw your name tag.

503
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.080
Wow, you have a good memory.

504
00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.120
Good.

505
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.190
I like red bean bread.

506
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.190
Seoul red bean bread.

507
00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:10.350
Me, I like pizza bread.
 - Really?

508
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.130
Yes.

509
00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.290
One pizza bread, one red bean bread.

510
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.600
Thank you.

511
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.460
Eat it deliciously
 - Yes

512
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.290
Aigoo.. Hey now the fishy smell is doing the bread-shuttle?

513
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.120
Hey, you punk just shut up and go.

514
00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:26.360
He's a senior...

515
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.080
So what? what?

516
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.470
Anyway go.

517
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:35.680
What are those guys?

518
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.740
Nothing. Don't pay attention.

519
00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:38.730
Please eat it.

520
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.120
I will eat well.
 - Yes

521
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.410
It's my first Seoul red bean bread.

522
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.150
I transferred.

523
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:54.940
Ah, that's why!

524
00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.940
For me, speaking with a Seoul accent is harder 
than speaking in English.

525
00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.720
You look cool, speaking in dialect.

526
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.960
I'll teach you?
 - Eh?

527
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.980
Do you want me to teach you how to 
speak in dialect?

528
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.340
Ah, Hahaha

529
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.320
You moved to Seoul?

530
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.680
Well. Something like that.

531
00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.710
Where do you live? 
I live in Buam 1 Dong.

532
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.650
I live in Buam 3 Dong.

533
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.180
That's the rich's area.

534
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.440
But I'm not rich.

535
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.830
Sunbae, you're…
 - What sunbae?

536
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.230
Just call me hyung.

537
00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:24.410
Yes.

538
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:28.360
Hyung, what else do you like, besides bread?

539
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.790
I like…

540
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:36.750
Seafood ramen which my grandma used to cook…

541
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:49.100
I grabbed a hairtail in each hand and turned them 
around like nunchucks.

542
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.110
'Hey do you want to be beaten by the silver hairtail today?'

543
00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.420
Then I ran to them, but they just ran away, 
never turning around.

544
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.780
Unnie.

545
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.230
Can I call you unnie?

546
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.370
I'm not a oppa, right?

547
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.580
Why do you ask such a thing?

548
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.070
Then, I will, too.

549
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:13.550
Unnie.

550
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.560
Hong Do unnie.

551
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.080
Mi Sook unnie.

552
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.270
Why are you like this?
 Like you've never called unnie before.

553
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.900
It's my first time.

554
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.970
Jung Hye, you have sisters, right?

555
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.330
I do.

556
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.490
I do have, but...

557
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.960
Unnie, you're a brave person.

558
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.060
Ayooo

559
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.480
Why, why wouldn't I be scared inside?

560
00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.620
When that woman said she would sue...

561
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.470
How much was I scared deep inside.

562
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.040
It's good that it's settled down well, but...

563
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.140
My feeling is...

564
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.550
She was so harsh to me.

565
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.300
But completely changed her attitude 
when it came to Jung Hye.

566
00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.400
There are too many people like that.

567
00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:03.850
Right.

568
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.120
I thought...

569
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.520
If I live my own life without doing any shameful thing,

570
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.650
I would never have to beg others for anything, 
that’s been my belief.

571
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.060
But, in the end, it’s a matter of money.

572
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.800
You did it because of your child.

573
00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.940
Anyone can be a parent.

574
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:34.080
But not all people can be good parents.

575
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:36.510
Anyone...

576
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.340
Unnie, you're a good mother.

577
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.740
Eh that’s…

578
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.240
Am I?

579
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:57.850
Hey, by the way, how are you with that kid?

580
00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.420
Who?

581
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.460
Ah... that kid?

582
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.300
I don't know.

583
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.450
It must be hard, but it must be hard for the little kid, too.

584
00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:11.320
He isn't a little kid.

585
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.400
Nine... teen... years old

586
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.340
Nineteen? Nineeen? 
Not nine, but 19?

587
00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.080
High school!

588
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.400
Yep, high school senior.
 - Oh, my word.

589
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:31.280
Your kids must have been so surprised.
 A big guy suddenly came.

590
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.500
No. She has no kids.

591
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.800
It's sunset already.

592
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.470
I will go ahead.

593
00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.280
You will?

594
00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.460
Ayooo Aigoo Aigoo

595
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.210
I’ll send her home after she wakes up.

596
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.160
Lay down here for a while, 
I'll come back soon.

597
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.740
So Jung Hye had a backstory like that.

598
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:14.700
However, if we’re going to do revenge or whatever, 
then we should know something about each other.

599
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.680
Yes, we should.

600
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.420
That is kind of like that.

601
00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:25.460
However, for me to drink alcohol like this and laugh 
so loudly, it’s been a really long time.

602
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:36.660
However, regarding another couple’s relationship, 
saying this is a bit like that...

603
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.000
but you’re really not going to get a divorce?

604
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.360
Yes.

605
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.980
You’re getting injured.

606
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.720
He doesn’t do it frequently.

607
00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:57.340
Occasionally, just really only occasionally, 
when he’s had a lot to drink.

608
00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:00.440
When he’s not like that, 
he’s usually a good person.

609
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.360
Aigoo, you frustrating person.

610
00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.800
It’s not that if only you take that thing out, he’s a good person. 
It’s because of that one thing that he’s a bad person.

611
00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:13.680
Being drunk and raising his hands, 
he definitely won’t be able to fix it.

612
00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.300
What makes you so happy that you smile?

613
00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.930
Because you seem to really be like a sister to me.

614
00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.340
Let’s go, little sister!

615
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:47.710
Water, water.

616
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:07.390
Ouch!

617
00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.660
Ouch!

618
00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.280
Oh, I’m hungry.

619
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.400
If you eat the ramen I make for you, you’ll go into shock over it. It's here.

620
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.680
Oooh.

621
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.640
- Soy bean sprouts! 
 -Soy bean sprouts?

622
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:11.936
It’s okay if it doesn’t have any.

623
00:45:11.984 --> 00:45:14.540
A seafood broth without soy bean sprouts is just wrong.

624
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:15.712
Hyung, you go in first.

625
00:45:15.728 --> 00:45:18.190
It’s right in front of my nose there, so I’ll be right back

626
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:21.200
Yah! I said it wasn’t necessary!

627
00:45:27.648 --> 00:45:29.400
For just a minute, I’ll be rude.

628
00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.400
Unnie!

629
00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:52.350
Hyung Do Unnie!

630
00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.600
Unnie, some toilet paper!

631
00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:19.660
My unnie… suffers so much… that her hands seem 
like a man’s hands.

632
00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.530
Unnie.

633
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.600
Hmm?

634
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.000
We will make sure to get revenge.

635
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.130
All the bad people, let’s kill them all! 
Lee Byun Soo - evil bastard.

636
00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.660
Avengers Club fighting!

637
00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.330
Mmm. Fighting!

638
00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:53.400
I’ll finish and be out soon.

639
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.600
What are you doing that 
you’re not going in yet?

640
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:14.000
Uh… Ah, I have something that I have to do right now, 
so I’ll eat it next time. Sorry.

641
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Brother!

642
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:42.500
Who are you?

643
00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:48.450
Who are you? 
You, who are you?

644
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:55.550
Are you a thief? 
This house… has no money.

645
00:47:55.550 --> 00:48:00.600
They’re poor. 
They’re so poor…

646
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.350
I’m not a thief. 
I’m the son of this household.

647
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.350
Mom!

648
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:10.750
Did my mother go somewhere?

649
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.100
Hm? Mom? Ahhhh. 
You’re Hee Soo?

650
00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:23.550
Yes, I’m Hee Soo. 
You’re mom’s friend, aren’t you?

651
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:28.400
I am her little sister. 
I’m her little sister.

652
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.200
And Hong Do Hee sister is my sister.

653
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.400
Yes. Hello. However, what about my mom?

654
00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.050
I don’t know.

655
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.300
She said she was coming right back.

656
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:47.950
So, I was so thirsty that I drank some water.

657
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:53.650
However, this is too bitter.

658
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:58.600
Sister…

659
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:06.650
Come sit here for a moment.

660
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:19.650
You must be so happy.

661
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:20.900
What?

662
00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.900
Hong Do Hee sister is your mother.

663
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.500
You must be so happy. 
So happy.

664
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.600
Yes, I’m happy.

665
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.700
I’ll clean up the empty bottles.

666
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:41.000
Yah! Give her to me. Give her to me. 
I’ll give you money. Okay?

667
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.550
What?

668
00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:45.100
My purse.

669
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:52.250
I have a LOT of money. 
How much?

670
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:56.050
How much is enough for Hong Do Hee sister?

671
00:49:56.050 --> 00:50:01.200
I only have $2,000. 
Card! Card!

672
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.450
Ouch. Ouch. 
That hurts. That hurts!

673
00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:06.050
Sell her!

674
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:09.150
I’m not selling her. 
I’m not selling her.

675
00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:12.250
You’re bad. You’re so bad!

676
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:16.600
If I sold mom, than I would be 
a really bad guy.

677
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:23.950
No. You’re not bad. 
You’re nice.

678
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:29.850
The bad ones are other bastards.

679
00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:33.450
You don’t know that, do you?

680
00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:35.450
Know what?

681
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:38.100
The bad guys, we…

682
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:44.200
Hong Do Hee sister and we are going to punish them.

683
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.050
Yes?

684
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:46.950
We’re going to take revenge…

685
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:48.950
What does that mean?

686
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.300
No, no. Ajumma you can’t do that here. 
To the bathroom.

687
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.800
The bathroom. Bathroom. Bathroom.

688
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:15.240
Let me go. 
I want to look for Hong Do unnie.

689
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:19.660
I can’t let you go. It will be dangerous if you 
come outside with this condition.

690
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:21.760
What are you doing?

691
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.120
Mom.

692
00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.120
Unnie...

693
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.260
Who is this ahjumma? 
She is so weird.

694
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:34.260
You are the one who is even weirder. 
Unnie, where have you gone?

695
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.200
Her drunken state is so cute.

696
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.460
She isn’t cute at all.

697
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:42.830
Why? Why?

698
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.500
Honey.

699
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:07.400
You're here?

700
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.070
Honey.

701
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.140
I thought you would be late. Why didn't you call me?
 - Eh, it's nothing.

702
00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.780
I cleaned the bathroom after long time. 
I feel refreshed.

703
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:17.560
Yes. Thank you.

704
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.380
I'll make dinner quickly.
 - You don't have to.

705
00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:27.150
Did you drink?

706
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.620
Y-yes. A li-little.

707
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:43.340
Did you drink?

708
00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.960
Y-yes. A li-little.

709
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.670
This fish is good.

710
00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.100
Yes. It's delicious.

711
00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.720
You drank, so you have no appetite.

712
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.000
N-no.

713
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:24.190
[Dohee unnie: Misook, are you home?
 I think I should let Jung Hye sleep here]

714
00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:26.640
Who is it?

715
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:29.420
An unnie I know.

716
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.660
You have that kind of person?

717
00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.870
A mother from Seo Yeon’s school.

718
00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.880
Don't needlessly get close 
with weird people. 

719
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:41.680
It's the beginning of election season, 
be careful of your behavior.

720
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.220
Of course, yes.

721
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.840
Jung Hye. Are you okay with 
not going home?

722
00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:04.140
I'm ok.

723
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.620
There’s nobody at home.

724
00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:09.240
Lee Byung Soo went on a business trip.

725
00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.080
Lee Byung Soo?

726
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:13.130
Husband.

727
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:17.240
Ah... there's one.

728
00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.710
That kid is there. 
That kid.

729
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:22.800
Hmmm, what was his name?

730
00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:26.060
Anyway, there’s that kid.

731
00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.040
Who is uselessly handsome.

732
00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:33.180
I don't want to go home.

733
00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.960
Jung Hye, by the way…
 - Ah, I don't know. I won't go.

734
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:41.880
I'll be here. 
Don't tell me to go.

735
00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.600
Yes, okay.

736
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:47.800
I'm not telling you to go, 
but wash up first before sleeping, huh?

737
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:50.110
If you don't, it will be harder tomorrow morning.

738
00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.710
I don't want to, it’s bothersome.

739
00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:53.530
Yes. You look so...

740
00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:58.140
Then, I will go, clean up, and come back. 
Get on the bed and sleep,

741
00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.320
OK? Understand?

742
00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:00.800
Up on the bed.

743
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.940
Yes.

744
00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.110
I've segregated the garbage.

745
00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.040
Aigoo. Thank you Mr. Son.

746
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:30.010
Mom
 - Um?

747
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:31.960
Today, I met the hyung who called 119 for me.

748
00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.830
He said he called immediately 
when he saw me fall.

749
00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:38.490
Aigoo, oh my, thank goodness!

750
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:39.760
So thankful.

751
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.280
We should pay him back.
 - Yes

752
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.090
So, we came home together.

753
00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:47.690
He’s a sunbae in his senior year, 
he’s tall and handsome.

754
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.530
His name is... Lee Soo Gyum.

755
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:51.470
Lee Soo Gyum?

756
00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:53.210
Then where is he?

757
00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.100
He was gone when I returned.
 - Soo Gyum.

758
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.130
It would be nice if I could see his face.
 - His name was Lee Soo Gyum. 

759
00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.800
Lee Soo Gyum was his name.

760
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.500
Aish!

761
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:31.100
Hello.

762
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.710
Are you doing well?
 - Yes, Father.

763
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:35.200
Did you arrive already?

764
00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.300
Yes. Don’t you feel uncomfortable staying with her?

765
00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.560
No. Not at all. I'm alright.

766
00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:41.640
That's a relief.

767
00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:43.900
Hey, but what's that sound?
 - Ah

768
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.430
I felt hot, so I came out for a walk.

769
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.100
There are too many cars here.

770
00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.170
Ahhh, alright.

771
00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:53.050
Then, take care!

772
00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:55.070
Yes, I will.

773
00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.060
Good morning!

774
00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:53.900
Are you feeling okay?

775
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.900
I brought you some honey water..

776
00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.820
Who are you?

777
01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:03.420
I’m the son of this house. 
I’m not a thief.

778
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.720
Thank you. 
Where is Hong Do Unnie?

779
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.540
She has to go early to buy the fishes and she asked me to give you 
honey water and prepare breakfast for you.

780
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.960
She asked you to call her 
once you woke up.

781
01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.520
Okay.

782
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:26.250
Would you like to eat some 
hangover soup ramen?

783
01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.510
Ramen?

784
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.020
I cook a really delicious one.

785
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.950
I put soy bean sprouts and a lot of seafood, 
so it’s really refreshing.

786
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:35.170
Everyone seems to like it.

787
01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.330
When mother’s friends drink here at the house,

788
01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:39.480
my responsibility is to make hangover soup ramen.

789
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:41.570
I’ll wash and come out.

790
01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:42.080
Yes.

791
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:50.550
Why are you laughing?

792
01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:55.510
Uhh…well, it’s just that now you’ve awoken from the alcohol, 
you seem like a completely different person.

793
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:02.280
I’ve left out a new toothbrush and a towel.

794
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.200
Oh, you startled me!

795
01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:53.710
Oh, you can’t!

796
01:01:53.710 --> 01:02:00.220
When it’s slightly undercooked, you have to leave the top on and 
let it sit for 30 seconds so that the noodles will be chewier.

797
01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:06.880
However, a lot of steam will be coming out. 
Taking it off…

798
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.600
No.

799
01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.600
Okay. Here.

800
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:21.150
<i>Hong Do Hee unni must be so happy.</i>

801
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.480
Here, it’s done.

802
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.420
Now, you just have to eat it.

803
01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:47.620
How is it?

804
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.710
It’s delicious.

805
01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:53.220
It is, isn’t it?!

806
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.080
I told you that I’m confident in my ramen making.

807
01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:58.910
Aren’t you eating?

808
01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.370
Oh, I ate rice earlier.

809
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:10.020
Please eat comfortably. 
I’ll go in my room.

810
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.820
If the portion is not enough, just let me know. 
I’ll give you some cold rice.

811
01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.820
Cold rice?! Why?

812
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.660
You don’t like me?

813
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.680
Huh?

814
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.260
Hand.

815
01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.620
Yes.

816
01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.460
Spending money.

817
01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.510
Oh, you don’t have to do this.

818
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:53.680
The ramen was delicious. 
Let’s see each other again next time.

819
01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:56.040
Go safely.

820
01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.370
Go Safely.

821
01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.600
What? 
What is this?

822
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Ai, this is driving me crazy! Really!

823
01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.290
Totally, he is a rich person.

824
01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.450
Son!

825
01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:47.100
If you appear so suddenly, what am I supposed to do?

826
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:50.640
Oh, my son, your face looks so much better.

827
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.030
It must be okay living here.

828
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.670
- Oh, you’ve almost completely become a Seoul person. 
 - Coming here, isn’t that a a little wrong of you?

829
01:04:58.030 --> 01:05:03.440
No. I mean, it’s the house that my son is living in… I’m curious about what it’s like.

830
01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.320
If you want to get something out of it, it would be better if you stayed quiet.

831
01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:09.370
Oh, you shrewd one!

832
01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:10.090
Ah!

833
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.940
Thanks to someone, you’re living the good life.

834
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.240
The wife here doesn’t harass you?

835
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:21.950
Well. Hardly.

836
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:24.250
Is it really magnificent? How is it?

837
01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.340
- At least, let’s go over there.
 - Why? Why? Why?

838
01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.960
- Yah, however… the house is really..
 - Oh, come on already.

839
01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.960
How far are we going?

840
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:52.620
- Ow. Ow. 
 - You..

841
01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:53.340
<i>You…</i>
- Ow. Ow. 
 - You..

842
01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:53.770
<i>You…</i>

843
01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.880
<i>Why?</i>

844
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:03.220
Ajumma!

845
01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:07.110
Ajumma!

846
01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:08.640
Have you arrived?

847
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.640
Ajumma’s husband hurt himself, 
so she’s going to be late today.

848
01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.370
She said she wasn’t able to contact Madam, 
so I told her that I would tell you	on her behalf.

849
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:26.930
Would you like to have lunch together?

850
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:29.860
I can actually cook pretty well.

851
01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.910
If that’s uncomfortable for you, 
then you don’t have to.

852
01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.310
I’ll try not to come downstairs.

853
01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.310
Please rest now.

854
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:45.840
Ramen.

855
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.460
I want to eat ramen.

856
01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:19.130
You must like ramen.

857
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:20.800
It’s the first time.

858
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.730
Huh?

859
01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:24.930
This morning was the first time I ate ramen. 
And, now is the second time.

860
01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.970
Oh. You’re the first person I’ve met who has said it’s the first time she had ramen.

861
01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.770
Oh, of course that can happen.

862
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:39.950
However, the first ramen must have appealed to your palate.

863
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:41.480
Yes, it was delicious.

864
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:43.480
And, this one?

865
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.330
It’s delicious.

866
01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:45.800
More than the first one?

867
01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.880
No.

868
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:56.080
You dislike me, don’t you?

869
01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:59.400
Of course, you must.

870
01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.750
I’m the child of your husband 
with another woman after all.

871
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.860
If you didn’t dislike me, 
it would be abnormal.
I’m the child of your husband

872
01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.400
If you didn’t dislike me, 
it would be abnormal.

873
01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.620
I don’t like that you’ve come into this house.

874
01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:12.660
However, that doesn’t mean that I dislike you.

875
01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.370
Why is that?

876
01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:16.800
Since you have done nothing wrong.

877
01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.800
And, I don’t know what kind of person you are even.

878
01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:25.640
Hey, still, if it were me, I think I would have just hated the sight of you.

879
01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.600
To Madam, isn’t my entire existence a problem for you?

880
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.620
This is an issue for adults. 
One that doesn’t involve you.

881
01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.820
No. This is also my issue.

882
01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:45.310
Do you not want to make a deal with me?

883
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:47.910
A deal?

884
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:52.110
Yes. I want to make a deal with Madam.

885
01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:55.040
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

886
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.370
Do you know why I’ve come into this house?

887
01:08:58.330 --> 01:08:59.440
Revenge.

888
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.040
I want to take revenge.
