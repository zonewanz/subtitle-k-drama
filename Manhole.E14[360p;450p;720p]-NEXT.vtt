1
00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.595
Here it is.

2
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:15.999
What's this?

3
00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:23.774
What?

4
00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:41.058
He was wearing a black 
cap and a black mask.

5
00:00:41.058 --> 00:00:42.159
Do you know...

6
00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:43.894
he was convicted for assault...

7
00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:45.929
and was hospitalized in 
a mental institute before?

8
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:02.446
No.

9
00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:06.249
It can't be.

10
00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.455
It's can't be you, Jae Hyun.

11
00:01:40.283 --> 00:01:41.284
Soo Jin.

12
00:01:52.262 --> 00:01:53.263
What's wrong?

13
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.965
Jae Hyun.

14
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.802
What is this bag?

15
00:02:01.138 --> 00:02:02.139
This one?

16
00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:06.810
It's my gym bag.

17
00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:13.683
Okay.

18
00:02:15.018 --> 00:02:16.319
Jae Hyun.

19
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:18.755
What is it?

20
00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:22.959
Keep going.

21
00:02:24.327 --> 00:02:28.031
Well... It's nothing.

22
00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.134
What's wrong?

23
00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:34.738
It's nothing. Really...

24
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.240
What are you thinking?

25
00:02:37.607 --> 00:02:38.942
You don't look good.

26
00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:51.354
I... I'm sorry.

27
00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.724
- Well... - Let's go home.

28
00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.143
He had a long scar...

29
00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.245
on his wrist...

30
00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:16.746
like this one.

31
00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:20.383
The piece of a key chain he found...

32
00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:21.918
at the crime scene matches my key chain.

33
00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:23.954
It seems like he thinks...

34
00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:25.388
- I'm the assailant. - He was wearing...

35
00:03:25.388 --> 00:03:27.357
a black cap and a black mask.

36
00:03:38.168 --> 00:03:39.302
Right.

37
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.038
I was going to do something in the kitchen.

38
00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.741
What was it?

39
00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.624
When we go to England,

40
00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:03.727
let's go to where we had our dates.

41
00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:06.997
Let's go walking in Hyde Park...

42
00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:09.566
and go to Portobello Market.

43
00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:13.436
Sure. Let's do that.

44
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:21.478
We'll spend a great time there.

45
00:04:24.748 --> 00:04:25.749
Jae Hyun.

46
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.451
What time will we leave here?

47
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.520
We should eat before we head out.

48
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.855
What should we have?

49
00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:34.824
I should've got some groceries.

50
00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.294
I'll go now.

51
00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.996
We can eat out.

52
00:04:40.397 --> 00:04:41.598
Don't worry about it.

53
00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.600
Can we?

54
00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:46.069
You're right.

55
00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:50.707
I should do the dishes. I...

56
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.711
need to finish this.

57
00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:57.714
- Do you want me to help? - No, Jae Hyun...

58
00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:59.883
I can do it...

59
00:05:22.872 --> 00:05:24.174
Jae Hyun.

60
00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:31.915
I'll just do it.

61
00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:37.654
Jae Hyun, go take a shower.

62
00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:41.057
You went in to take a shower.

63
00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:42.859
Why did you come back out?

64
00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:45.695
You'll finish faster if we do it together.

65
00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:48.298
After you shower,

66
00:05:48.498 --> 00:05:50.300
get your underwear...

67
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.435
and the clothes you'll bring to England.

68
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.207
England is cooler than Seoul, right?

69
00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:01.544
Get long-sleeved shirts and cardigan.

70
00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.686
- All right. - Okay.

71
00:07:08.912 --> 00:07:10.113
Soo Jin.

72
00:07:17.821 --> 00:07:18.855
Kang Soo Jin.

73
00:07:58.027 --> 00:08:00.096
Anyway, anyone can see that you were wrong.

74
00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:03.867
So you need to apologize to Jae Hyun...

75
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.035
and to Soo Jin.

76
00:08:13.543 --> 00:08:16.779
(My Precious)

77
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.465
(Jae Hyun)

78
00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:42.839
Soo Jin. You must not trust this guy.

79
00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:44.707
He's dangerous.

80
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:00.390
(Pil)

81
00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:04.260
Pil.

82
00:09:05.094 --> 00:09:07.363
I don't think I can see you anymore.

83
00:09:08.197 --> 00:09:09.499
No, I won't see you anymore.

84
00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:17.407
What am I going to do?

85
00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.045
What should I do?

86
00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:30.720
A bottle of soju?

87
00:09:31.754 --> 00:09:33.256
Okay.

88
00:09:34.223 --> 00:09:36.159
Soo Jin, what brings you here?

89
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.330
Jin Sook, can we talk?

90
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.899
Hey, is something wrong?

91
00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:45.168
Excuse me. One more bottle of sake, please.

92
00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:46.169
Yes, sir!

93
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.571
I'll be right back.

94
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:50.673
Please stay here.

95
00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:51.741
It'll only be a minute.

96
00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:06.623
- Here you go. - Thanks.

97
00:10:06.623 --> 00:10:07.790
Excuse me!

98
00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.492
- What? - Excuse me.

99
00:10:25.608 --> 00:10:27.076
Mom, I'm here.

100
00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:28.645
Hey, Soo Jin.

101
00:10:29.312 --> 00:10:31.848
Jae Hyun. Soo Jin is here.

102
00:10:32.115 --> 00:10:33.249
Yes, Mother.

103
00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:02.378
Sir, please step on it.

104
00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:27.437
Soo Jin.

105
00:11:40.016 --> 00:11:41.417
(My Precious)

106
00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:45.388
Hello? Soo Jin.

107
00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:46.489
Pil.

108
00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:48.658
Please help me.

109
00:11:49.258 --> 00:11:50.560
I'm really scared.

110
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.695
Soo Jin, where are you?

111
00:12:58.094 --> 00:12:59.128
Pil!

112
00:12:59.962 --> 00:13:00.963
Soo Jin.

113
00:13:18.147 --> 00:13:20.183
She's meeting that punk again?

114
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.257
Soo Jin.

115
00:14:02.558 --> 00:14:04.460
Soo Jin, wake up. Soo Jin.

116
00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:06.062
Soo Jin!

117
00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:08.898
What?

118
00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:11.067
I...

119
00:14:11.334 --> 00:14:15.304
I ran over Soo Jin?

120
00:14:29.185 --> 00:14:30.286
Hey.

121
00:14:31.387 --> 00:14:32.488
Soo Jin.

122
00:14:33.422 --> 00:14:34.657
Soo Jin!

123
00:14:40.263 --> 00:14:41.264
Soo Jin.

124
00:14:42.164 --> 00:14:44.267
I won't let you die like this.

125
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.002
I'll...

126
00:14:46.402 --> 00:14:48.170
I'll do whatever it takes to save you.

127
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.606
Soo Jin, don't die.

128
00:14:51.207 --> 00:14:52.508
Wait here.

129
00:14:59.382 --> 00:15:00.616
Soo Jin.

130
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.618
Soo Jin...

131
00:15:02.618 --> 00:15:05.187
What happened to Soo Jin?

132
00:15:05.254 --> 00:15:07.290
She went to the OR just now.

133
00:15:07.757 --> 00:15:08.758
What?

134
00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:10.760
How badly is she injured?

135
00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:12.828
She's unconscious.

136
00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:15.264
My goodness.

137
00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:17.533
What should we do?

138
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.902
It's all right. She's going to be all right.

139
00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:20.937
Mother.

140
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.105
What do you mean she got into an accident?

141
00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.141
What happened?

142
00:15:25.308 --> 00:15:26.509
Jae Hyun.

143
00:15:26.776 --> 00:15:29.278
Soo Jin was a victim of a hit-and-run.

144
00:15:29.712 --> 00:15:31.047
She came to the house,

145
00:15:31.047 --> 00:15:32.581
but she didn't come in...

146
00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:34.550
and went to see him...

147
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.485
and got into an accident.

148
00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:40.222
You punk.

149
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.692
You went after Soo Jin all your life.

150
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.361
You ended up causing trouble.

151
00:15:45.394 --> 00:15:46.963
Bring back Soo Jin.

152
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.298
I said bring her back!

153
00:15:49.298 --> 00:15:51.400
Why on earth did she...

154
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.436
go to see you?

155
00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:55.905
She called me.

156
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.643
As soon as I met her, she got hit before my eyes.

157
00:16:00.643 --> 00:16:02.044
Did you catch the culprit?

158
00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:05.781
- No. - What a scum.

159
00:16:06.148 --> 00:16:08.117
How could they run away after hitting a person?

160
00:16:08.117 --> 00:16:09.719
That horrible scum.

161
00:16:09.852 --> 00:16:13.856
What should we do? Gosh, Soo Jin...

162
00:16:32.375 --> 00:16:33.376
Suction.

163
00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:53.229
Why won't Soo Jin answer her phone?

164
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:56.232
She seemed like she came here to say something.

165
00:17:00.469 --> 00:17:01.470
Jin Sook!

166
00:17:02.038 --> 00:17:03.039
Jin Sook.

167
00:17:03.205 --> 00:17:05.074
Seok Tae, what's wrong?

168
00:17:05.074 --> 00:17:06.275
Soo Jin...

169
00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:08.277
was a victim of a hit-and-run.

170
00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.345
What?

171
00:17:26.228 --> 00:17:27.897
We operated on her physical injuries,

172
00:17:27.897 --> 00:17:30.666
but the problem is that she's still unconscious.

173
00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:35.971
We'll have to see how she recovers.

174
00:17:36.272 --> 00:17:37.273
Let's go.

175
00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:40.876
Honey.

176
00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:42.678
What should we do?

177
00:17:43.712 --> 00:17:45.181
My poor Soo Jin.

178
00:17:45.181 --> 00:17:47.650
She'll wake up for certain.

179
00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:49.418
She'll wake up.

180
00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:50.986
Honey.

181
00:17:51.187 --> 00:17:53.289
Don't think that she'll stay like this forever.

182
00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:54.890
Think on the bright side.

183
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.841
Soo Jin.

184
00:18:13.609 --> 00:18:14.777
So why...

185
00:18:15.111 --> 00:18:16.612
did you suspect me?

186
00:18:17.613 --> 00:18:19.815
You should've trusted me when I denied it.

187
00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:29.358
Hey, Pil.

188
00:18:30.793 --> 00:18:32.027
How is Soo Jin?

189
00:18:32.061 --> 00:18:33.429
I heard they finished the surgery.

190
00:18:33.996 --> 00:18:35.331
She's still unconscious.

191
00:18:35.598 --> 00:18:37.833
Oh, no. Poor Soo Jin.

192
00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:39.101
This is terrible.

193
00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:42.538
Why did you go to see her by the way?

194
00:18:43.606 --> 00:18:45.641
She called me and asked for my help.

195
00:18:45.641 --> 00:18:47.209
Help for what?

196
00:18:47.476 --> 00:18:48.744
I'm not sure.

197
00:18:49.979 --> 00:18:51.780
It sounded very urgent.

198
00:18:52.781 --> 00:18:55.050
Soo Jin came to see me a while ago.

199
00:18:55.317 --> 00:18:57.286
She looked so serious then.

200
00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:00.623
I should've listened to her when she came to me.

201
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.392
Only if I had told her to stay,

202
00:19:04.026 --> 00:19:05.861
she wouldn't have gotten into the accident.

203
00:19:06.095 --> 00:19:07.663
It's my fault.

204
00:19:08.097 --> 00:19:10.232
It's not your fault. Don't think of it that way.

205
00:19:12.868 --> 00:19:14.036
You're all here.

206
00:19:14.436 --> 00:19:16.639
Jae Hyun, you must've been surprised.

207
00:19:16.939 --> 00:19:19.041
I still can't believe it.

208
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.113
We promised to go to England together tomorrow.

209
00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:26.949
How could she...

210
00:19:26.949 --> 00:19:29.552
Soo Jin will wake up soon.

211
00:19:29.785 --> 00:19:31.453
Let's try to be positive.

212
00:19:31.687 --> 00:19:33.789
Yes, we should.

213
00:19:34.957 --> 00:19:38.060
They said she needs rest now,

214
00:19:38.194 --> 00:19:39.595
so go in later.

215
00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:43.098
Okay.

216
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.303
Pil, where are you going?

217
00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:48.971
What's wrong with him?

218
00:19:49.305 --> 00:19:52.675
He might cause trouble if we don't stop him.

219
00:19:52.708 --> 00:19:54.643
Let's follow him.

220
00:20:10.659 --> 00:20:11.727
Please.

221
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:13.429
Please.

222
00:20:14.396 --> 00:20:16.165
Please take me there.

223
00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:25.341
I need to save her.

224
00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:27.409
Please.

225
00:20:29.178 --> 00:20:33.082
Please take me to before the accident.

226
00:20:58.307 --> 00:21:00.042
Why doesn't it work?

227
00:21:01.944 --> 00:21:05.214
Please work. Please.

228
00:21:10.252 --> 00:21:11.687
Hey, Pil.

229
00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:12.755
- Hey. - Stop.

230
00:21:12.755 --> 00:21:14.156
What are you doing?

231
00:21:14.156 --> 00:21:15.457
Stop already.

232
00:21:15.658 --> 00:21:17.259
What are you doing?

233
00:21:17.259 --> 00:21:18.927
Soo Jin is unconscious in the hospital.

234
00:21:19.962 --> 00:21:21.964
But there's nothing I can do for her.

235
00:21:22.665 --> 00:21:25.334
She's in a critical state,

236
00:21:26.101 --> 00:21:27.603
but I'm not of any help.

237
00:21:27.603 --> 00:21:28.871
We feel the same.

238
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:30.506
You're not the only one who's frustrated.

239
00:21:30.506 --> 00:21:32.875
Go catch the culprit when you have time for this.

240
00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.610
What's the use in catching the culprit?

241
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.313
It won't make her wake up.

242
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:39.715
Seok Tae.

243
00:21:41.116 --> 00:21:43.352
I can't live if something happens to Soo Jin.

244
00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:46.188
Can you please let me open up this manhole?

245
00:21:47.823 --> 00:21:48.824
Seok Tae.

246
00:21:51.126 --> 00:21:52.528
- Goodness. - Let me...

247
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:55.564
Please let me have a chance to save her.

248
00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:56.965
I ask of you.

249
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.701
Seok Tae.

250
00:21:59.668 --> 00:22:01.870
I beg you. Please.

251
00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:06.875
Hey, wait.

252
00:22:07.142 --> 00:22:09.044
Why would you break the manhole?

253
00:22:09.678 --> 00:22:10.746
To save Soo Jin?

254
00:22:11.046 --> 00:22:12.681
What are you talking about?

255
00:22:13.816 --> 00:22:15.584
I ask of you, please.

256
00:22:16.952 --> 00:22:18.987
What can we do to save Soo Jin?

257
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:22.891
I have to save her.

258
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.594
Seok Tae.

259
00:22:26.695 --> 00:22:28.564
What am I going to do?

260
00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:40.909
Goodness, Mr. Park. Hello.

261
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:42.211
What brings you here?

262
00:22:42.211 --> 00:22:43.912
Thank you for your hard work.

263
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.349
Did you find any leads on the hit-and-run?

264
00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:51.387
Well, it happened in a very remote place.

265
00:22:51.387 --> 00:22:52.855
We couldn't find many security footages.

266
00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:56.392
We're looking into footage from another angle,

267
00:22:56.392 --> 00:22:59.061
but that place had too much traffic,

268
00:22:59.061 --> 00:23:01.597
so it's hard to see which is the perpetrator.

269
00:23:02.664 --> 00:23:03.932
- Is that so? - The case..

270
00:23:03.932 --> 00:23:05.834
Has been handed over to the police detectives,

271
00:23:05.834 --> 00:23:08.437
so we have to wait and see what they come up with.

272
00:23:08.437 --> 00:23:10.172
We're also looking for any eyewitnesses.

273
00:23:10.172 --> 00:23:11.840
We'll call you as soon as we have a lead.

274
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.908
Don't worry.

275
00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:14.843
Anyway.

276
00:23:16.111 --> 00:23:18.313
How is your wife dong?

277
00:23:19.181 --> 00:23:21.417
She's still unconscious. Here.

278
00:23:21.417 --> 00:23:23.018
- Oh, it's all right. - No.

279
00:23:23.018 --> 00:23:24.553
Thank you for the thought.

280
00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.122
Goodbye, then.

281
00:23:27.256 --> 00:23:28.290
Sure.

282
00:24:09.998 --> 00:24:12.267
I was the one who said nothing bad...

283
00:24:13.402 --> 00:24:14.970
will ever happen to you.

284
00:24:21.477 --> 00:24:23.846
I should've been hit by the car instead of you.

285
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:28.884
I should've saved you.

286
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.091
Soo Jin.

287
00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:39.394
I don't mind if you get angry at me.

288
00:24:41.697 --> 00:24:43.866
I don't care if you don't consider me as a friend.

289
00:24:43.866 --> 00:24:44.933
No.

290
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.769
I don't mind even if you don't wish to see me.

291
00:24:48.804 --> 00:24:50.572
I just need you to wake up again.

292
00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:54.610
I ask of you.

293
00:25:03.485 --> 00:25:05.153
What are you doing here?

294
00:25:10.792 --> 00:25:12.261
I came to see how she's doing.

295
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:14.229
I would like you to never come here,

296
00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:15.931
since she has me.

297
00:25:32.915 --> 00:25:33.916
Yesterday,

298
00:25:34.416 --> 00:25:37.753
Soo Jin called me and asked me for help.

299
00:25:39.688 --> 00:25:41.023
Do you know anything about that?

300
00:25:42.157 --> 00:25:44.526
How would I know? She called you, not me.

301
00:25:44.526 --> 00:25:46.628
If she was desperate enough to ask me for help,

302
00:25:47.262 --> 00:25:50.432
shouldn't you know what it is as her husband?

303
00:25:52.734 --> 00:25:53.735
So what?

304
00:25:54.536 --> 00:25:57.539
Are you blaming me for not being a good husband?

305
00:25:57.539 --> 00:25:59.675
If she was in such an emergency,

306
00:26:00.609 --> 00:26:03.011
why would she call me instead of her husband?

307
00:26:03.412 --> 00:26:05.047
I just thought that was very odd.

308
00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:08.550
I'm curious too.

309
00:26:09.117 --> 00:26:11.753
I wonder what kind of help she wanted to get.

310
00:26:14.723 --> 00:26:16.892
You can ask her yourself once she wakes up.

311
00:26:30.105 --> 00:26:31.540
Will you please leave?

312
00:27:13.148 --> 00:27:14.249
Seok Tae.

313
00:27:15.651 --> 00:27:17.886
I can't live if something happens to Soo Jin.

314
00:27:18.487 --> 00:27:20.722
Can you please let me open up this manhole?

315
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.458
Seok Tae.

316
00:27:25.527 --> 00:27:26.561
- Goodness. - Hey.

317
00:27:26.862 --> 00:27:29.231
Please let me have a chance to save her.

318
00:27:29.498 --> 00:27:30.532
I ask of you.

319
00:27:31.433 --> 00:27:32.467
Seok Tae.

320
00:27:33.535 --> 00:27:35.671
I beg you. Please.

321
00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:47.849
What's really happening with it is that...

322
00:27:48.717 --> 00:27:52.254
Excuse me, sir, I have something to ask.

323
00:27:52.254 --> 00:27:53.355
What is it?

324
00:27:53.555 --> 00:27:54.623
Well, it's about...

325
00:27:54.823 --> 00:27:58.093
the manhole we closed up three months ago.

326
00:27:59.294 --> 00:28:01.830
I would like to do a reconstruction on it.

327
00:28:03.198 --> 00:28:06.301
All of a sudden? Why?

328
00:28:06.535 --> 00:28:07.736
Well...

329
00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:12.107
Someone wanted us to open it up again.

330
00:28:12.741 --> 00:28:14.342
May we perform another construction?

331
00:28:14.342 --> 00:28:15.677
I thought people said...

332
00:28:15.677 --> 00:28:17.813
they wanted it closed because of weird sounds.

333
00:28:17.813 --> 00:28:19.414
Do they want to open it up this time?

334
00:28:19.514 --> 00:28:21.817
- My goodness. - I guess so.

335
00:28:23.719 --> 00:28:24.753
Here.

336
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.421
Seok Tae.

337
00:28:26.421 --> 00:28:28.223
Did he disapprove?

338
00:28:28.623 --> 00:28:30.125
He did.

339
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.328
What will Pil do now?

340
00:28:33.328 --> 00:28:34.629
He thinks the only way...

341
00:28:34.629 --> 00:28:36.665
he can save her is by getting into that manhole.

342
00:28:37.332 --> 00:28:38.900
It's really absurd...

343
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.336
how we're stressing over this unbelievable story.

344
00:28:42.003 --> 00:28:44.339
But if only Pil can really travel through time...

345
00:28:44.339 --> 00:28:46.074
through that manhole to save her,

346
00:28:46.074 --> 00:28:47.542
I'd break it open for him.

347
00:28:53.749 --> 00:28:57.352
Yes, some people grant wishes for the dead.

348
00:28:57.552 --> 00:28:59.688
Why wouldn't I do that for my friend who's alive?

349
00:29:00.522 --> 00:29:02.891
Jin Sook, let's open that thing up.

350
00:29:03.925 --> 00:29:05.994
- What? - He does sound crazy,

351
00:29:06.394 --> 00:29:09.564
but there's nothing else we can do for Soo Jin.

352
00:29:09.798 --> 00:29:11.233
I mean, when people get desperate,

353
00:29:11.233 --> 00:29:13.034
they go and worship at temples...

354
00:29:13.034 --> 00:29:15.003
or pray at churches.

355
00:29:15.203 --> 00:29:18.173
Let's give it a chance.

356
00:29:22.344 --> 00:29:26.915
(NU Hospital)

357
00:29:50.972 --> 00:29:52.507
What will happen to Soo Jin?

358
00:29:54.142 --> 00:29:56.011
I didn't even know this happened.

359
00:29:57.445 --> 00:29:59.047
You should've called me.

360
00:30:00.515 --> 00:30:03.585
I thought you didn't care about us anymore.

361
00:30:04.452 --> 00:30:05.821
That makes no sense.

362
00:30:06.121 --> 00:30:07.656
I'm a part of this family too.

363
00:30:11.693 --> 00:30:14.162
I heard you got into an incident too.

364
00:30:15.931 --> 00:30:18.233
- Are you all right? - Can't you tell?

365
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.268
I've been all right for some time.

366
00:30:22.704 --> 00:30:24.573
Everyone should live happily.

367
00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:26.842
Why do things like this keep on happening?

368
00:30:28.009 --> 00:30:29.110
Hey.

369
00:30:30.445 --> 00:30:32.881
I heard you ordered juice from Jung Ae.

370
00:30:36.017 --> 00:30:37.052
Yes.

371
00:30:37.752 --> 00:30:39.955
Did you think you would be forgiven...

372
00:30:39.955 --> 00:30:41.489
for what you did to her...

373
00:30:41.489 --> 00:30:43.091
just because you bought some juice from her?

374
00:30:43.658 --> 00:30:45.293
I didn't do that to be forgiven.

375
00:30:46.194 --> 00:30:48.463
Ordering juice isn't a grand gesture.

376
00:30:52.367 --> 00:30:53.768
Hey, let me ask you one thing.

377
00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:56.805
Why did you leave her?

378
00:30:59.341 --> 00:31:00.709
I thought she would be unhappy...

379
00:31:01.209 --> 00:31:03.111
if she stayed with me.

380
00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.316
As long as I am still my mom's son,

381
00:31:09.017 --> 00:31:11.253
as long as I can't cut off ties with her,

382
00:31:12.754 --> 00:31:14.956
I didn't think I could make her happy.

383
00:31:14.956 --> 00:31:16.892
That's nothing but an excuse.

384
00:31:17.325 --> 00:31:20.061
You just did not love her enough, that's all.

385
00:31:20.161 --> 00:31:21.196
You just...

386
00:31:21.997 --> 00:31:23.331
ran away because you were afraid.

387
00:31:27.836 --> 00:31:28.904
Yes.

388
00:31:29.504 --> 00:31:31.172
I suppose you might be right.

389
00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:34.009
If you were in my situation,

390
00:31:34.409 --> 00:31:37.512
you would've protected her until the end.

391
00:31:39.981 --> 00:31:41.449
I always knew...

392
00:31:41.616 --> 00:31:44.286
that you loved her much more than I did.

393
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.354
I knew that she would be...

394
00:31:46.888 --> 00:31:49.190
much happier if she was with you.

395
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.097
It's...

396
00:31:56.698 --> 00:31:59.334
too late for me to make her happy in this life.

397
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:02.804
I hope you can...

398
00:32:04.205 --> 00:32:05.540
make Jung Ae happy.

399
00:32:37.305 --> 00:32:38.606
Jae Hyun, you're here.

400
00:32:42.177 --> 00:32:44.112
Didn't Jung Ae come here?

401
00:32:44.813 --> 00:32:45.880
No, she didn't.

402
00:32:47.482 --> 00:32:49.884
You're doing so much to care for Soo Jin.

403
00:32:49.884 --> 00:32:52.153
Not at all. I'm happy to do it.

404
00:32:52.287 --> 00:32:53.455
Jae Hyun.

405
00:32:53.588 --> 00:32:54.889
I'll stay here.

406
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:56.591
You should go home and get some rest.

407
00:32:58.727 --> 00:33:00.428
Okay. Thank you.

408
00:33:00.829 --> 00:33:03.298
I'll go get changed and come back.

409
00:33:03.631 --> 00:33:04.799
- All right. - Okay.

410
00:33:13.708 --> 00:33:15.810
Soo Jin. I'll be right back.

411
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.223
I'll be back soon.

412
00:34:30.218 --> 00:34:32.420
- Aren't I heavy? - No.

413
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.355
You're light as a feather, Jin Sook.

414
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.759
Thanks for saying that.

415
00:34:37.759 --> 00:34:38.760
Move faster.

416
00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.429
We're almost there. Please don't rush me.

417
00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:42.430
What?

418
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:44.532
How many bowls of rice did you eat earlier?

419
00:34:46.201 --> 00:34:47.635
Hey, Pil!

420
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:50.105
Are you still at this?

421
00:34:50.472 --> 00:34:51.773
Why are you here?

422
00:34:52.207 --> 00:34:53.575
Shouldn't you be at work?

423
00:34:53.575 --> 00:34:56.478
Hey, we're here to help your crazy idea.

424
00:35:01.249 --> 00:35:02.317
What's that?

425
00:35:03.284 --> 00:35:04.319
I'm not...

426
00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:07.122
helping you because I believe you travel time,

427
00:35:07.155 --> 00:35:09.090
but because I'm touched...

428
00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.392
by how desperately you're trying to save Soo Jin.

429
00:35:11.426 --> 00:35:13.695
I could get fired for this.

430
00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:14.696
That's right.

431
00:35:16.464 --> 00:35:17.699
Get out of the way.

432
00:35:18.266 --> 00:35:19.567
Gosh. Let's see.

433
00:35:19.801 --> 00:35:21.603
- Okay. - How should we do this?

434
00:35:21.603 --> 00:35:22.904
Shall we start?

435
00:35:23.304 --> 00:35:25.807
Hey! Pil!

436
00:35:26.441 --> 00:35:28.343
Why aren't you answering your phone?

437
00:35:28.343 --> 00:35:29.644
- Goo Gil. - Goo Gil.

438
00:35:30.812 --> 00:35:33.381
Hey, I have something to tell you.

439
00:35:33.648 --> 00:35:34.649
What is it?

440
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.118
- Come with me. - What is it?

441
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:39.888
It's nothing.

442
00:35:39.954 --> 00:35:41.623
Hurry up. Follow me.

443
00:35:41.623 --> 00:35:44.325
- What? - We have to dig this.

444
00:35:44.325 --> 00:35:45.660
What's it about?

445
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.228
Hurry up.

446
00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:51.633
What is it?

447
00:35:52.534 --> 00:35:54.969
I don't know if I should say this.

448
00:35:55.703 --> 00:35:57.939
Should I tell you or not?

449
00:35:57.939 --> 00:35:59.274
What is it?

450
00:35:59.274 --> 00:36:02.410
Don't be shocked, okay?

451
00:36:04.379 --> 00:36:06.181
Remember how I told you...

452
00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:09.551
I saw a scar on the assailant's wrist?

453
00:36:09.551 --> 00:36:10.552
Yes.

454
00:36:11.386 --> 00:36:13.388
Gosh, this is crazy.

455
00:36:14.189 --> 00:36:15.723
What is it, Goo Gil?

456
00:36:17.158 --> 00:36:18.526
Today...

457
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.296
I saw Jae Hyun's wrist.

458
00:36:22.463 --> 00:36:24.332
He had the same scar.

459
00:36:28.903 --> 00:36:29.904
Is that true?

460
00:36:30.205 --> 00:36:31.206
Yes.

461
00:36:32.807 --> 00:36:36.110
Everyone has a scar, right?

462
00:36:36.511 --> 00:36:37.679
But why does he have...

463
00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:41.249
the same scar on his left wrist?

464
00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:46.120
It can't be him, can it?

465
00:36:46.688 --> 00:36:48.456
There is too much evidence that says otherwise.

466
00:36:49.224 --> 00:36:50.625
The broken key chain.

467
00:36:50.992 --> 00:36:52.093
The scar on the wrist.

468
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.896
They can't be all coincidences.

469
00:36:55.296 --> 00:36:57.699
- You're right, but... - He's the assailant.

470
00:36:58.566 --> 00:36:59.634
I'm sure of it.

471
00:36:59.701 --> 00:37:01.736
Hey, where are you going?

472
00:37:01.736 --> 00:37:03.671
He's with Soo Jin.

473
00:37:04.272 --> 00:37:05.740
How can I stay put?

474
00:37:07.342 --> 00:37:09.377
Goo Gil, thank you.

475
00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:13.514
Should I have kept quiet?

476
00:37:14.282 --> 00:37:16.084
Is he going to cause trouble again?

477
00:37:22.523 --> 00:37:23.558
What is it this time?

478
00:37:23.625 --> 00:37:24.959
You and I need to talk.

479
00:37:25.526 --> 00:37:26.561
Follow me.

480
00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:31.466
What are you doing?

481
00:37:31.466 --> 00:37:33.034
You shameless dirt bag!

482
00:37:33.434 --> 00:37:35.370
How dare you stay with Soo Jin?

483
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:36.371
What are you saying?

484
00:37:36.371 --> 00:37:39.707
The assault victim saw the scar on your wrist.

485
00:37:42.176 --> 00:37:43.177
Who did?

486
00:37:43.311 --> 00:37:44.646
Did Goo Gil say that?

487
00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.748
Now you and your friends...

488
00:37:46.748 --> 00:37:48.883
are outright trying to frame me.

489
00:37:48.883 --> 00:37:50.685
We'll see about that.

490
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.688
What are you doing?

491
00:38:13.474 --> 00:38:14.876
What happened?

492
00:38:15.176 --> 00:38:17.412
I got hurt earlier. Why?

493
00:38:18.446 --> 00:38:20.181
Is that a problem?

494
00:38:20.481 --> 00:38:21.816
You did this...

495
00:38:21.816 --> 00:38:24.085
because you knew Goo Gil saw your scar.

496
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.021
I'm speechless.

497
00:38:27.622 --> 00:38:30.525
Don't drag me into your crazy speculation.

498
00:38:30.858 --> 00:38:32.260
Think whatever you want.

499
00:38:33.528 --> 00:38:35.563
If you hit me again,

500
00:38:37.231 --> 00:38:39.667
it won't be over with just a suspension.

501
00:38:42.537 --> 00:38:44.906
Think before you act.

502
00:38:47.975 --> 00:38:49.077
You're a civil servant.

503
00:38:54.048 --> 00:38:56.217
Soo Jin's life is hanging by a thread,

504
00:38:56.217 --> 00:38:58.119
but you're talking nonsense.

505
00:38:58.219 --> 00:38:59.654
You're really pathetic.

506
00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:02.223
I see why Soo Jin...

507
00:39:02.223 --> 00:39:03.491
said she won't see you again.

508
00:39:04.992 --> 00:39:06.361
If you're a police officer,

509
00:39:06.361 --> 00:39:08.930
you should bring a solid proof.

510
00:39:10.064 --> 00:39:11.065
All right?

511
00:39:15.403 --> 00:39:16.804
The proof you talked about.

512
00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:20.508
I'll bring that proof and show you,

513
00:39:20.508 --> 00:39:21.509
so just wait.

514
00:39:22.643 --> 00:39:23.745
I...

515
00:39:24.312 --> 00:39:26.514
will expose you for who you really are.

516
00:39:40.495 --> 00:39:41.662
- Officer Bong. - Hi.

517
00:39:41.662 --> 00:39:43.831
- You shouldn't be here. - There are no tissues...

518
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.069
Hey, Officer Bong. What are you doing here?

519
00:39:48.436 --> 00:39:49.437
Don't you remember?

520
00:39:49.437 --> 00:39:52.340
You can't be here until your suspension is over.

521
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.341
Sir.

522
00:39:53.508 --> 00:39:55.777
You still have the surveillance video, right?

523
00:39:55.777 --> 00:39:57.145
Hey, Officer Bong.

524
00:39:58.112 --> 00:39:59.113
Sir.

525
00:39:59.847 --> 00:40:01.649
I must catch him.

526
00:40:02.884 --> 00:40:06.020
We're police officers too. You aren't the only one.

527
00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.256
- Go home and wait. - Sir!

528
00:40:09.357 --> 00:40:10.825
Why you...

529
00:40:13.361 --> 00:40:14.729
Please, sir.

530
00:40:15.763 --> 00:40:18.166
If you say it like that...

531
00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:36.017
This is...

532
00:40:36.284 --> 00:40:37.685
him.

533
00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:42.256
Evidence.

534
00:40:44.425 --> 00:40:46.594
I need to find evidence that he is Park Jae Hyun.

535
00:40:55.336 --> 00:40:58.906
Hey, I don't think drilling will work.

536
00:40:59.273 --> 00:41:01.776
By the way, why aren't they coming?

537
00:41:01.776 --> 00:41:02.777
Guys!

538
00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:04.879
What?

539
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.018
Gosh. Oh Dal Soo?

540
00:41:13.187 --> 00:41:15.022
Dal Soo, what brings you here?

541
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:17.325
I hear you need help.

542
00:41:18.025 --> 00:41:19.026
Long time no see.

543
00:41:21.362 --> 00:41:22.630
Anyway,

544
00:41:22.864 --> 00:41:25.099
what are you doing here?

545
00:41:25.766 --> 00:41:28.402
Can't you see? We're drilling.

546
00:41:29.003 --> 00:41:31.105
We're making Pil's wish come true.

547
00:41:31.138 --> 00:41:32.173
What wish?

548
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:37.812
Time travel?

549
00:41:38.646 --> 00:41:41.249
Are you doing this because you believe him?

550
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:42.617
Do you really believe in what Pil said?

551
00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:45.486
My goodness.

552
00:41:45.486 --> 00:41:47.588
My gosh, we don't believe him.

553
00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:50.224
We're trying to believe him, you idiot.

554
00:41:50.725 --> 00:41:52.960
Do you think we know anything?

555
00:41:53.261 --> 00:41:55.663
We're just doing whatever we can to wake Soo Jin up.

556
00:41:55.997 --> 00:41:57.198
Hey, Seok Tae.

557
00:41:57.632 --> 00:41:59.534
Do you think drilling will work?

558
00:41:59.734 --> 00:42:01.802
With this it'll take like 10 years.

559
00:42:03.004 --> 00:42:04.071
Then what?

560
00:42:05.907 --> 00:42:07.608
Hey, Dal Soo.

561
00:42:26.294 --> 00:42:27.428
Honey.

562
00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:29.230
Honey!

563
00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:31.966
Soo Jin just moved her finger.

564
00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:33.334
What are you talking about?

565
00:42:37.605 --> 00:42:39.941
Soo Jin.

566
00:42:45.212 --> 00:42:46.447
Can you hear me?

567
00:42:50.818 --> 00:42:54.388
Jae Hyun. Soo Jin is awake.

568
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.626
Soo Jin, can you hear me?

569
00:43:02.797 --> 00:43:04.465
Do you recognize me?

570
00:43:13.874 --> 00:43:16.377
Soo Jin, can you recognize us?

571
00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:19.280
Yes.

572
00:43:22.717 --> 00:43:23.784
Where...

573
00:43:24.652 --> 00:43:25.953
Where am I?

574
00:43:25.953 --> 00:43:28.956
Do you remember about the accident?

575
00:43:34.128 --> 00:43:35.963
The accident?

576
00:43:40.501 --> 00:43:41.869
No.

577
00:43:43.237 --> 00:43:45.539
I don't remember anything.

578
00:43:47.475 --> 00:43:50.778
It's okay. As long as you recognize us, it's okay.

579
00:43:50.778 --> 00:43:52.780
- That's right. - Honey, call the doctor.

580
00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.815
Right, okay. Let's go.

581
00:44:10.331 --> 00:44:11.499
Here.

582
00:44:13.501 --> 00:44:14.602
It's fortunate.

583
00:44:14.602 --> 00:44:17.405
Now that she's awake, you can be assured.

584
00:44:17.705 --> 00:44:19.940
We just need to watch how she recovers...

585
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.442
from her injuries.

586
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.544
By the way,

587
00:44:23.844 --> 00:44:26.747
it seems like she can't remember the accident.

588
00:44:27.348 --> 00:44:29.383
Are you sure there aren't other problems?

589
00:44:29.984 --> 00:44:32.386
Some patients suffer short-term memory loss...

590
00:44:32.386 --> 00:44:34.722
due to the shock of their accident.

591
00:44:34.722 --> 00:44:37.558
They eventually regain their memory after time,

592
00:44:37.558 --> 00:44:38.926
so don't worry too much.

593
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.662
That's good to hear.

594
00:44:41.662 --> 00:44:44.265
Don't force her to regain her memory.

595
00:44:44.265 --> 00:44:47.868
Make sure that she can rest completely.

596
00:44:47.868 --> 00:44:49.136
- Okay. - Sure.

597
00:44:49.704 --> 00:44:50.771
Honey.

598
00:45:08.322 --> 00:45:09.356
Pil.

599
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:50.965
Soo Jin.

600
00:45:56.737 --> 00:45:57.772
Are you okay?

601
00:45:58.405 --> 00:45:59.840
Can you remember anything now?

602
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:06.480
Where are my parents?

603
00:46:07.248 --> 00:46:09.884
I told them to get something to eat.

604
00:46:09.884 --> 00:46:11.152
They starved all day long.

605
00:46:11.819 --> 00:46:12.853
I see.

606
00:46:13.954 --> 00:46:15.156
That's good.

607
00:46:19.126 --> 00:46:20.127
Soo Jin.

608
00:46:22.129 --> 00:46:23.664
Can't you remember...

609
00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:26.467
anything about the accident?

610
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:30.104
No.

611
00:46:32.473 --> 00:46:33.874
I don't.

612
00:46:37.378 --> 00:46:39.480
How much do you remember?

613
00:46:41.582 --> 00:46:42.650
Well...

614
00:46:45.452 --> 00:46:48.656
That we promised to go on a trip to England.

615
00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:52.459
And...

616
00:46:54.628 --> 00:46:56.730
that I found...

617
00:46:57.865 --> 00:47:00.401
the tickets for our flight in your suit pocket.

618
00:47:02.536 --> 00:47:03.571
So...

619
00:47:04.205 --> 00:47:06.674
you don't remember anything after that?

620
00:47:08.209 --> 00:47:09.276
No.

621
00:47:10.945 --> 00:47:12.179
Jae Hyun.

622
00:47:14.215 --> 00:47:16.851
What happened?

623
00:47:17.184 --> 00:47:19.286
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

624
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:22.423
Let's forget all the bad memories.

625
00:47:25.025 --> 00:47:27.061
Let's get some rest first.

626
00:47:28.896 --> 00:47:30.064
Okay.

627
00:47:31.332 --> 00:47:33.801
I'll get some sleep.

628
00:47:34.602 --> 00:47:36.303
I'm so sleepy.

629
00:47:36.737 --> 00:47:38.405
Okay, go ahead.

630
00:47:38.405 --> 00:47:39.406
Okay.

631
00:47:57.391 --> 00:47:58.893
The proof you talked about.

632
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.196
I'll bring that proof and show you,

633
00:48:02.196 --> 00:48:03.330
so just wait.

634
00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:05.666
I...

635
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.369
will expose you for who you really are.

636
00:49:12.833 --> 00:49:13.834
Excuse me.

637
00:49:14.301 --> 00:49:15.736
You shouldn't move around.

638
00:49:15.736 --> 00:49:17.104
Go back in your room.

639
00:49:17.104 --> 00:49:18.872
You just had an operation.

640
00:49:18.872 --> 00:49:19.873
Excuse me.

641
00:49:21.008 --> 00:49:22.743
I'm really sorry,

642
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:25.279
but can I make a phone call?

643
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.982
I have some urgent matters to take care of.

644
00:49:28.382 --> 00:49:29.616
It's very urgent.

645
00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:39.626
Hello?

646
00:49:39.927 --> 00:49:41.028
Pil.

647
00:49:42.629 --> 00:49:43.630
Pil.

648
00:49:44.798 --> 00:49:46.400
Are you Soo Jin?

649
00:49:46.734 --> 00:49:47.768
Yes.

650
00:49:48.335 --> 00:49:50.237
I just woke up.

651
00:49:50.838 --> 00:49:52.973
I'm calling you in secret.

652
00:49:55.776 --> 00:49:57.177
Please come here quickly.

653
00:49:57.678 --> 00:49:59.113
I have something to tell you.

654
00:49:59.113 --> 00:50:01.048
Okay, I'll go to your room right now.

655
00:50:01.048 --> 00:50:02.116
No.

656
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:05.052
Let's meet in front of the hospital.

657
00:50:05.986 --> 00:50:07.287
Okay.

658
00:51:14.221 --> 00:51:15.823
Turn green. Hurry.

659
00:51:35.609 --> 00:51:36.810
Soo Jin.

660
00:51:38.979 --> 00:51:40.814
Why is she outside?

661
00:52:09.977 --> 00:52:10.978
Soo Jin.

662
00:52:22.422 --> 00:52:24.191
Soo Jin. What's wrong with you?

663
00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.541
Soo Jin.

664
00:52:41.275 --> 00:52:42.376
Kang Soo Jin!

665
00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:16.743
(Emergency Stairs)

666
00:54:07.261 --> 00:54:08.595
(Emergency Stairs)

667
00:54:18.105 --> 00:54:19.139
Soo Jin.

668
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:51.571
Hey, be careful.

669
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:05.319
Hey, Goo Gil. How much longer will it take?

670
00:55:05.452 --> 00:55:07.120
You need to hurry. People might report us.

671
00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.822
Okay, man.

672
00:55:10.924 --> 00:55:13.527
When did Goo Gil learn to do this?

673
00:55:14.227 --> 00:55:16.697
Didn't he say he served in the army with this?

674
00:55:17.097 --> 00:55:19.733
If you think about it, he's a talented man.

675
00:55:31.011 --> 00:55:33.046
Hey, Kang Soo Jin!

676
00:55:43.523 --> 00:55:44.558
Don't come near me.

677
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.061
You.

678
00:55:49.529 --> 00:55:51.298
You remember everything, don't you?

679
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.001
You remember...

680
00:55:57.003 --> 00:55:59.005
everything that happened before the accident.

681
00:55:59.606 --> 00:56:01.308
Don't come near.

682
00:56:02.743 --> 00:56:04.644
Go away, Jae Hyun.

683
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:07.614
Then...

684
00:56:09.149 --> 00:56:10.751
why did you lie to me?

685
00:56:12.419 --> 00:56:13.487
Why?

686
00:56:16.556 --> 00:56:18.191
I can explain everything.

687
00:56:21.194 --> 00:56:23.697
I think there is some kind of a misunderstanding.

688
00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:29.102
We need to talk.

689
00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:31.571
Come on.

690
00:56:35.108 --> 00:56:36.209
Soo Jin.

691
00:56:38.678 --> 00:56:39.679
Yes.

692
00:56:41.348 --> 00:56:42.883
I remember everything.

693
00:56:50.824 --> 00:56:52.759
The person who hit me with a car.

694
00:56:54.528 --> 00:56:56.263
That was you, Jae Hyun.

695
00:56:58.765 --> 00:57:00.767
So go away.

696
00:57:02.402 --> 00:57:04.204
I said, go away.

697
00:57:05.672 --> 00:57:07.340
Don't come near me!

698
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:11.645
Soo Jin!

699
00:57:13.046 --> 00:57:14.080
Pil.

700
00:57:17.451 --> 00:57:18.452
Soo Jin.

701
00:57:19.619 --> 00:57:20.787
Come here.

702
00:57:21.421 --> 00:57:22.522
Come to me.

703
00:57:34.935 --> 00:57:36.036
It's open.

704
00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:38.104
- It's open. - He did it.

705
00:57:38.672 --> 00:57:40.707
- He did it. - It worked.

706
00:57:40.707 --> 00:57:43.109
- Goo Gil, it worked. - That's awesome.

707
00:57:43.243 --> 00:57:44.811
Success.

708
00:57:44.945 --> 00:57:46.146
Hey, wait.

709
00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.014
Now that we opened this,

710
00:57:48.348 --> 00:57:49.616
what do we have to do?

711
00:57:52.486 --> 00:57:53.487
I don't know.

712
00:57:56.256 --> 00:57:57.390
You're right.

713
00:57:57.390 --> 00:58:00.026
- Pil didn't tell us. - What?

714
00:58:00.227 --> 00:58:01.228
Hey.

715
00:58:01.561 --> 00:58:02.863
Don't you come near us.

716
00:58:04.164 --> 00:58:05.599
Let go of me.

717
00:58:05.599 --> 00:58:07.200
I'm telling you, let go of her.

718
00:58:07.934 --> 00:58:09.202
Let go of her.

719
00:58:09.202 --> 00:58:10.737
This is all because of you.

720
00:58:12.405 --> 00:58:14.941
If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here.

721
00:58:15.842 --> 00:58:17.444
Get lost.

722
00:58:18.345 --> 00:58:20.814
Unless you want to see her die because of you.

723
00:58:22.282 --> 00:58:23.416
Do you remember what I said?

724
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:26.119
I said I'll expose you for who you really are.

725
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.154
Everything is over.

726
00:58:28.622 --> 00:58:29.723
Give up.

727
00:58:30.056 --> 00:58:31.124
Is that so?

728
00:58:32.259 --> 00:58:33.727
Is everything over?

729
00:58:36.129 --> 00:58:38.265
Then we'll end this all together.

730
00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:42.602
Hey, have we been...

731
00:58:42.602 --> 00:58:44.604
opening this without knowing the next step?

732
00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.308
I'm sure he told you something.

733
00:58:48.308 --> 00:58:50.210
I don't. He just wanted me to open this up.

734
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:51.811
He didn't tell me what I should do.

735
00:58:51.811 --> 00:58:52.946
Should I call him?

736
00:58:52.946 --> 00:58:54.014
Hurry up and call him.

737
00:58:54.481 --> 00:58:55.482
Goodness.

738
00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:00.921
What's going on?

739
00:59:02.289 --> 00:59:03.290
What?

740
00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:04.658
What's this?

741
00:59:05.892 --> 00:59:07.027
- What's going on? - Goodness.

742
00:59:07.027 --> 00:59:08.028
I have no idea.

743
00:59:16.136 --> 00:59:17.137
Soo Jin.

744
00:59:20.173 --> 00:59:21.508
Don't come near me.

745
00:59:23.743 --> 00:59:24.744
If you do,

746
00:59:27.914 --> 00:59:29.249
I'll jump.

747
00:59:29.249 --> 00:59:30.417
Soo Jin, no.

748
00:59:31.318 --> 00:59:32.619
It's too dangerous. Come down.

749
00:59:41.561 --> 00:59:42.862
Don't come near me.

750
00:59:47.534 --> 00:59:48.735
- Don't! - Soo Jin!

751
00:59:55.542 --> 00:59:56.910
What just happened?

752
00:59:57.444 --> 00:59:59.446
- Did you just see that? - Yes.

753
00:59:59.446 --> 01:00:00.547
What was that?

754
01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:25.205
What... What was that?

755
01:00:25.972 --> 01:00:27.307
Who saw that?

756
01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:29.909
Did you both see that?

757
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:31.711
Yes.

758
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.015
What was that?

759
01:00:35.248 --> 01:00:36.249
Goodness.

760
01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:37.384
Hey.

761
01:00:37.751 --> 01:00:39.085
That was weird.

762
01:01:00.473 --> 01:01:01.474
What?

763
01:01:02.275 --> 01:01:03.910
Where am I?

764
01:01:04.277 --> 01:01:05.278
What happened?

765
01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.213
I'm sure I went through that manhole.

766
01:01:10.684 --> 01:01:11.685
Soo Jin!
