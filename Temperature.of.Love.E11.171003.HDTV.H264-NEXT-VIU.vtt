00:00:06.927 --> 00:00:08.797
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:09.627 --> 00:00:12.767
I succeeded and earned a lot of money.

3
00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:14.707
But my dad isn't here.

4
00:00:15.707 --> 00:00:17.506
He passed away before he could witness my success.

5
00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.706
I want to make a family.

6
00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:24.817
I think I'll be able to live happily with you.

7
00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:28.846
I won the contest.

8
00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:30.756
But...

9
00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:32.656
I'm not pleased.

10
00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:36.287
I have a man I love.

11
00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:39.457
But I realized it too late.

12
00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:44.167
I realized what love is...

13
00:00:45.537 --> 00:00:47.807
only after he disappeared from my sight.

14
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:50.006
You...

15
00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:54.707
Are you aware what you're doing to me right now?

16
00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:56.807
He asked me to wait for him.

17
00:00:58.277 --> 00:00:59.817
He called me.

18
00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:04.116
But I couldn't take his call because I was with you.

19
00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:07.257
It was his last call.

20
00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:10.926
I should've taken it.

21
00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:14.667
Where must I go to see him now?

22
00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:25.736
(December, 2012)

23
00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:32.277
What does that man do for a living?

24
00:01:35.947 --> 00:01:38.417
I don't know why I'm asking you this right now.

25
00:01:39.357 --> 00:01:40.656
What good will it do to me?

26
00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:43.656
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:43.727 --> 00:01:44.796
Don't be sorry.

28
00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:47.626
Being sorry only means that this is the end.

29
00:01:49.397 --> 00:01:51.066
And don't be scared.

30
00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:53.807
I'm not going to make you feel uncomfortable.

31
00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:57.307
Thank you.

32
00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:05.046
I like this song.

33
00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:16.856
- Should I turn it off? - No, it's okay.

34
00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:35.547
Hyun Soo doesn't go out with just anyone.

35
00:02:36.077 --> 00:02:38.446
She doesn't go on blind dates or date just any guy she knows.

36
00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:40.047
She's full of doubt.

37
00:02:41.217 --> 00:02:42.487
She thinks of love very rationally.

38
00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:44.557
She said she wants to get married to someone...

39
00:02:44.557 --> 00:02:47.286
who respects her and whom she can respect in return.

40
00:02:48.656 --> 00:02:49.957
If you want to date Hyun Soo,

41
00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:52.497
it's important that you win her trust.

42
00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:56.897
It's been a while.

43
00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:01.936
It's hard to see you at work since you go abroad on business a lot.

44
00:03:01.936 --> 00:03:03.006
(April, 2013)

45
00:03:04.077 --> 00:03:05.837
You don't need to come to work anymore.

46
00:03:06.837 --> 00:03:08.047
Really?

47
00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:10.476
You never mentioned anything like that.

48
00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:12.577
Since when were you so obedient?

49
00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:18.856
Why aren't you offering to sign a contract with me?

50
00:03:21.027 --> 00:03:22.686
I know you get a lot of offers from other companies.

51
00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:24.457
I'm sure you feel uncomfortable with me.

52
00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:27.527
You said you won't make me feel uncomfortable.

53
00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:31.367
What you just did right now...

54
00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:35.566
You lift the right side of your lip whenever you smile. It's very sexy.

55
00:03:40.807 --> 00:03:41.876
Really?

56
00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:43.106
Yes.

57
00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:47.987
Let's sign a contract.

58
00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:50.356
Okay.

59
00:03:50.957 --> 00:03:52.557
I'll earn you a lot of money.

60
00:03:52.557 --> 00:03:53.856
I already earned a lot of money.

61
00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:55.886
And I can always earn money from other things.

62
00:03:56.386 --> 00:03:57.856
You can write whatever you want to write.

63
00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:02.797
Thank you.

64
00:04:03.897 --> 00:04:05.737
I need to go to Paris for about a month.

65
00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:07.636
I'll be doing business there and meeting people.

66
00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:11.337
- Should I get you a gift? - Yes.

67
00:04:12.277 --> 00:04:13.647
I can't believe you.

68
00:04:13.707 --> 00:04:15.247
You thought I'd refuse, didn't you?

69
00:04:15.577 --> 00:04:17.046
That's why I said yes.

70
00:04:29.887 --> 00:04:30.897
Hey.

71
00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:38.796
It seems like you've become a bit taller.

72
00:04:38.996 --> 00:04:41.937
I'm too old to grow. I even served in the military.

73
00:04:42.137 --> 00:04:44.077
You've pretty much done everything.

74
00:04:44.077 --> 00:04:45.777
All that's left is to succeed.

75
00:04:46.507 --> 00:04:48.377
You graduate next year?

76
00:04:48.507 --> 00:04:52.176
Once I graduate, I'm going to spend two years working at a restaurant.

77
00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:54.317
I want to be acknowledged as a chef here.

78
00:04:54.687 --> 00:04:57.717
All you think about is work. Don't you date?

79
00:04:58.587 --> 00:05:00.187
That's something for me to say.

80
00:05:00.187 --> 00:05:02.156
Girls must love you.

81
00:05:02.926 --> 00:05:04.156
You must be picky.

82
00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:05.757
No, I'm not.

83
00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:07.866
I was rejected recently.

84
00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:09.467
She likes someone else apparently.

85
00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:12.267
I was rejected too before I left for Paris.

86
00:05:13.236 --> 00:05:15.306
She said work is more important than love.

87
00:05:15.306 --> 00:05:18.176
She's ambitious. I like her.

88
00:05:18.176 --> 00:05:19.937
I'm glad you like her.

89
00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:23.616
I'm going to see her again when I get back to Korea.

90
00:05:23.616 --> 00:05:25.077
I'll introduce you to her then.

91
00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:27.746
What if I take her away?

92
00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:32.017
First of all, she won't let you take her away.

93
00:05:32.017 --> 00:05:34.486
And plus, she's seeing someone else right now.

94
00:05:34.486 --> 00:05:35.887
Apparently, they might get married.

95
00:05:38.627 --> 00:05:40.567
Don't give me that look.

96
00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:47.166
Never in my wildest dreams did I think...

97
00:05:47.236 --> 00:05:50.067
that we were having this conversation about one woman.

98
00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:54.007
If I'd known this first,

99
00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:58.277
would I have been able to calm his rage a bit?

100
00:05:59.947 --> 00:06:01.517
I still wonder.

101
00:06:02.147 --> 00:06:06.457
(Temperature of Love)

102
00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:10.087
(2017)

103
00:06:10.087 --> 00:06:12.697
What's this out of the blue?

104
00:06:12.697 --> 00:06:15.527
My goodness. This is what happens when you work with newcomers.

105
00:06:15.527 --> 00:06:17.197
They make a fuss over nothing.

106
00:06:17.197 --> 00:06:19.397
Things like this happen all the time if you work in TV.

107
00:06:19.397 --> 00:06:22.437
Since these things happen all the time, you should go through it too.

108
00:06:22.837 --> 00:06:25.736
Do you think I'm staying put because I like your directing?

109
00:06:25.736 --> 00:06:27.707
There's no detail whatsoever.

110
00:06:27.707 --> 00:06:29.106
My goodness.

111
00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:32.676
What did I do wrong in my past life to end up as the chief producer?

112
00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:33.916
(Chief Producers aid producers to make sure the production goes well.)

113
00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:36.346
You two can grab each other's hair and fight...

114
00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:39.187
or beat each other up and go to the police. Do whatever you want.

115
00:06:39.187 --> 00:06:40.556
And Ms. Lee,

116
00:06:40.556 --> 00:06:43.327
you keep saying that I matched you up and involving me in this.

117
00:06:43.327 --> 00:06:45.627
A matchmaker's job is done when the connection is made.

118
00:06:45.627 --> 00:06:48.096
Whether you two live with each other or not is up to you.

119
00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:50.837
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:51.197 --> 00:06:53.806
And also, the show must go on.

121
00:06:54.137 --> 00:06:55.637
I've been through this a lot too.

122
00:06:55.637 --> 00:06:57.777
I tried attaching writers and everything.

123
00:06:57.777 --> 00:06:59.676
But only those who are meant to succeed make it.

124
00:06:59.676 --> 00:07:02.346
It's a waste of energy to fight your teammate.

125
00:07:02.846 --> 00:07:04.976
Spare me, Yi Bok.

126
00:07:07.187 --> 00:07:08.187
Anyways,

127
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.257
if the ratings drop again tomorrow, you both...

128
00:07:15.027 --> 00:07:16.087
are out.

129
00:07:16.897 --> 00:07:17.957
Out.

130
00:07:18.726 --> 00:07:20.767
I want beer.

131
00:07:20.827 --> 00:07:23.027
Beer and fried chicken?

132
00:07:23.127 --> 00:07:26.036
Beer, chicken, and tourte.

133
00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:28.467
Gosh, he's showing off again.

134
00:07:28.567 --> 00:07:31.476
But I tried it too.

135
00:07:31.536 --> 00:07:32.707
It was good.

136
00:07:32.707 --> 00:07:35.077
I know how to make it too.

137
00:07:36.176 --> 00:07:39.147
Make it for me. I want to eat it.

138
00:07:39.147 --> 00:07:40.486
Stop, stop.

139
00:07:41.317 --> 00:07:43.687
Why are you guys acting like kids?

140
00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:45.916
Like kids, like kids.

141
00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:47.627
- No, stop! - Excuse me.

142
00:07:47.627 --> 00:07:49.056
You guys ordered fried chicken, right?

143
00:07:50.257 --> 00:07:52.426
- Who ordered it? - I didn't.

144
00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:56.496
Speak of the devil.

145
00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:57.666
There he is.

146
00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:13.476
They're having fun.

147
00:08:13.887 --> 00:08:15.746
My boys should be having fun.

148
00:08:16.817 --> 00:08:18.556
You actually have a lot of affection.

149
00:08:19.056 --> 00:08:20.426
You'll end up getting hurt.

150
00:08:20.426 --> 00:08:22.486
And you put up quite a wall.

151
00:08:22.687 --> 00:08:24.627
You won't get hurt much.

152
00:08:24.957 --> 00:08:27.767
I reached the conclusion after getting hurt a lot.

153
00:08:27.926 --> 00:08:30.127
I have to split people to keep by my side and those I shouldn't.

154
00:08:32.766 --> 00:08:34.636
I'm honored you're keeping me by my side.

155
00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:38.106
Be good.

156
00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:40.077
If you disappoint me,

157
00:08:40.077 --> 00:08:42.577
I'll seek company much less.

158
00:08:42.577 --> 00:08:44.146
Yes, Mr. Park.

159
00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:46.646
But why did you spare your precious time...

160
00:08:46.646 --> 00:08:48.447
to come here?

161
00:08:49.217 --> 00:08:51.217
Have you heard of "Star's Favorite Dish"?

162
00:08:51.217 --> 00:08:52.557
It's a new SBC variety show.

163
00:08:52.957 --> 00:08:55.827
I've heard of it, but I haven't watched it.

164
00:08:56.356 --> 00:08:57.596
Watch it.

165
00:08:57.596 --> 00:08:59.557
This week, it's a battle between two French chefs.

166
00:09:00.126 --> 00:09:02.996
But Chef Seo Dae Han suddenly had to go abroad.

167
00:09:03.596 --> 00:09:06.337
You're his replacement. How lucky.

168
00:09:06.797 --> 00:09:08.937
It's too early to say I'm lucky.

169
00:09:09.437 --> 00:09:10.776
Who's the other chef?

170
00:09:10.776 --> 00:09:13.437
They don't tell you. You'll find out once you get there.

171
00:09:13.807 --> 00:09:15.106
The guest is Lee Deul Lae.

172
00:09:15.106 --> 00:09:18.016
She's a middle-aged actor who's still quite famous.

173
00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:19.776
If she chooses your dish,

174
00:09:20.146 --> 00:09:22.016
it'll be a great opportunity for you.

175
00:09:27.856 --> 00:09:28.856
Good luck!

176
00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:38.636

(Assistant Director Jun Ho)

178
00:09:54.646 --> 00:09:55.646
Director Min,

179
00:09:56.746 --> 00:09:58.187
what do you want?

180
00:09:58.957 --> 00:10:01.386
Is there any way we can come to an agreement?

181
00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:02.726
Listen to me.

182
00:10:02.957 --> 00:10:04.396
That's the agreement.

183
00:10:04.957 --> 00:10:08.626
You can't attach writers even if you want to now.

184
00:10:09.026 --> 00:10:10.866
It's a genre piece. The story logic needs to make sense,

185
00:10:10.866 --> 00:10:12.396
and you need to do research.

186
00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:14.337
Are you threatening me right now?

187
00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:17.006
I respect you.

188
00:10:17.476 --> 00:10:19.677
I'm only asking that you respect me too.

189
00:10:19.907 --> 00:10:22.246
It's good that you fixed the script depending on the situation on set.

190
00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.276
You're good at it.

191
00:10:23.276 --> 00:10:26.776
I'll shoot everything on your script without changing anything.

192
00:10:27.346 --> 00:10:29.817
Let's see how the ratings are next week.

193
00:10:30.047 --> 00:10:32.116
Don't regret it then.

194
00:10:33.187 --> 00:10:35.927
Why do you keep being so negative?

195

(On Jung Sun)

198
00:11:28.207 --> 00:11:29.707
I don't like you.

199
00:11:30.717 --> 00:11:33.317
Are you doing exactly what I did to you?

200
00:11:55.636 --> 00:11:56.736
(Missed call)

201
00:12:03.746 --> 00:12:06.077
I checked the staff schedule earlier,

202
00:12:06.077 --> 00:12:08.187
and the shoot starts early in the morning tomorrow.

203
00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:11.016
They must be shooting additional scenes for tomorrow's episode.

204
00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:13.886
I heard from the director.

205
00:12:15.226 --> 00:12:16.687
It must be hard for everyone.

206
00:12:18.526 --> 00:12:20.567
Who doesn't have it hard here?

207
00:12:22.697 --> 00:12:24.396
So what's he going to do now?

208
00:12:25.766 --> 00:12:28.067
This hits the spot.

209
00:12:28.207 --> 00:12:31.077
I love drinking coffee at this hour.

210
00:12:31.077 --> 00:12:32.876
You're escaping reality.

211
00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:34.146
Bingo.

212
00:12:37.016 --> 00:12:39.177
This hits the spot.

213
00:12:42.447 --> 00:12:43.687
Goodness.

214
00:12:43.986 --> 00:12:46.986
(On Jung Sun)

215
00:12:46.986 --> 00:12:48.126
Oh, my.

216
00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.226
Why?

217
00:12:50.327 --> 00:12:51.996
It's nothing. I'm going to take this call inside.

218
00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:59.636
Hello. This is Lee Hyun Soo.

219
00:12:59.736 --> 00:13:00.937
I know.

220
00:13:01.766 --> 00:13:03.407
You knew it was my number?

221
00:13:04.006 --> 00:13:06.736
I should ask that question. How did you know my number?

222
00:13:07.776 --> 00:13:09.146
I got it from Won Joon.

223
00:13:11.776 --> 00:13:14.787
You're being picky. So what if I know your number?

224
00:13:14.917 --> 00:13:16.246
Is something up?

225
00:13:16.917 --> 00:13:19.157
No. I mean...

226
00:13:19.157 --> 00:13:21.157
There's a lot going on. I met the director.

227
00:13:22.256 --> 00:13:25.557
That's not really my field, so I don't know what to say.

228
00:13:26.356 --> 00:13:28.096
You just have to listen.

229
00:13:28.526 --> 00:13:31.337
It's hard to just listen. I'm a man.

230
00:13:31.337 --> 00:13:33.437
My instinct is to want to solve it.

231
00:13:35.537 --> 00:13:36.766
Okay.

232
00:13:37.307 --> 00:13:39.236
Then I'll ask a girl.

233
00:13:39.636 --> 00:13:41.746
We're good at just listening.

234
00:13:42.707 --> 00:13:44.516
Then you don't have a particular reason for calling me?

235
00:13:45.317 --> 00:13:46.417
No.

236
00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:50.016
Then good night. You can't skip your meals when working.

237
00:13:50.687 --> 00:13:53.756
Okay. You sleep tight too.

238
00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.366
You can't skip your meals when working.

239
00:14:02.866 --> 00:14:04.366
He's flirting with me.

240
00:14:06.437 --> 00:14:08.736
Do you want me to teach you what I did when I was sad?

241
00:14:10.437 --> 00:14:11.876
Then I should flirt with him too.

242
00:14:18.476 --> 00:14:21.787
(Will you solve it for me?)

243
00:14:33.766 --> 00:14:35.126
Will you solve it for me?

244
00:14:37.937 --> 00:14:38.967
How?

- Are you going to give up? - No.

247
00:14:59.886 --> 00:15:01.486
You can stop if it's too tiring.

248
00:15:01.787 --> 00:15:02.927
No, I'm going to keep running.

249
00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:04.496
I'm going to work after this.

250
00:15:06.256 --> 00:15:09.197
There's a huge gap between watching a drama and producing one.

251
00:15:09.427 --> 00:15:11.067
It seemed like really hard work.

252
00:15:11.067 --> 00:15:12.366
You should've completed the shooting.

253
00:15:13.636 --> 00:15:15.207
I wouldn't have asked you to run if I knew.

254
00:15:16.366 --> 00:15:18.907
Were you surprised to find out that I was the main writer?

255
00:15:22.177 --> 00:15:23.646
Did you already know before agreeing to appear on the show?

256
00:15:25.376 --> 00:15:28.087
Let's go. You said you need to go to work.

257
00:15:29.187 --> 00:15:30.886
Why aren't you answering my question?

258
00:15:37.697 --> 00:15:38.726
You're here.

259
00:15:38.927 --> 00:15:39.996
Isn't anyone here yet?

260
00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:42.327
No. You guys are so lazy.

261
00:15:42.327 --> 00:15:43.766
This is why I decided to gather everyone.

262
00:15:44.236 --> 00:15:47.337
You can't just suddenly make a group chat and tell us to come out.

263
00:15:47.337 --> 00:15:48.736
Hurry up, and get over here!

264
00:15:52.476 --> 00:15:54.177
I'm tired. Why did you make us come here?

265
00:15:54.506 --> 00:15:55.707
I'm not tired.

266
00:15:56.077 --> 00:15:58.177
I really like this guy.

267
00:15:58.577 --> 00:16:01.047
That's too bad because I really don't like you.

268
00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:03.986
My gosh, he's exactly my type.

269
00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:05.256
Min Ho, you're really popular.

270
00:16:05.287 --> 00:16:06.657
You can't call this being popular.

271
00:16:06.657 --> 00:16:09.356
They're just putting me in the middle of their emotional dispute.

272
00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.996
My gosh, I really like you too.

273
00:16:12.297 --> 00:16:15.366
Now, let us proceed. "Where there is a will, there is a way."

274
00:16:15.366 --> 00:16:17.297
"Where there is..."

275
00:16:17.297 --> 00:16:20.467
My gosh. "Where there is a will, there is a way."

276
00:16:20.467 --> 00:16:22.967
Won Joon, please don't talk like an old man.

277
00:16:22.967 --> 00:16:25.037
Gosh, you guys are so dumb.

278
00:16:25.207 --> 00:16:26.636
It's a proverb.

279
00:16:26.636 --> 00:16:28.177
It means you can achieve anything...

280
00:16:28.177 --> 00:16:29.807
as long as you focus.

281
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:31.016
Thank you, Ha Sung.

282
00:16:31.376 --> 00:16:32.917
When Chef On starts appearing on TV,

283
00:16:32.917 --> 00:16:34.047
we'll be on our own.

284
00:16:34.217 --> 00:16:35.687
I called you out here...

285
00:16:35.687 --> 00:16:37.417
to rekindle our cooperative spirit.

286
00:16:38.787 --> 00:16:39.787
Where's Chef On?

287
00:16:39.787 --> 00:16:41.287
He's right. Why isn't he here?

288
00:16:41.287 --> 00:16:43.287
I didn't call him. He needs to rest.

289
00:16:43.287 --> 00:16:44.356
He needs to turn over a new leaf.

290
00:16:44.657 --> 00:16:46.096
Look. He's doing it again.

291
00:16:46.226 --> 00:16:47.667
I said, it's a proverb!

292
00:16:52.537 --> 00:16:54.037
You'll get more tired if you take a break.

293
00:16:54.037 --> 00:16:55.366
You need to run at a steady pace.

294
00:16:55.366 --> 00:16:58.236
Your nagging hasn't gone away at all.

295
00:16:58.236 --> 00:17:00.746
You're always the same because you think of this as nagging.

296
00:17:01.407 --> 00:17:02.476
I'm always the same?

297
00:17:03.447 --> 00:17:04.976
I hate hearing that.

298
00:17:05.447 --> 00:17:08.546
I want to be someone who betters myself every day.

299
00:17:08.687 --> 00:17:11.417
This is the problem of achievement oriented education.

300
00:17:11.556 --> 00:17:13.157
Why must you always better yourself?

301
00:17:14.957 --> 00:17:15.957
You're right.

302
00:17:16.627 --> 00:17:18.326
Why do I always need to better myself?

303
00:17:18.957 --> 00:17:20.296
I guess that's one thing that's changed about you.

304
00:17:21.826 --> 00:17:23.266
Yes, that's one thing that's changed about me.

305
00:17:24.897 --> 00:17:26.637
It must be really hard.

306
00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:29.336
You always need to have high ratings.

307
00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:31.607
And now that you're a writer, you need to become more famous...

308
00:17:31.607 --> 00:17:32.937
That's not true.

309
00:17:34.746 --> 00:17:36.207
I'm not trying to become more famous,

310
00:17:36.207 --> 00:17:38.816
and I'm not pressured about getting high ratings.

311
00:17:39.947 --> 00:17:41.347
I just...

312
00:17:42.546 --> 00:17:44.086
the drama that I wrote...

313
00:17:44.687 --> 00:17:47.986
to help the viewers go on with their day.

314
00:17:48.986 --> 00:17:49.986
That's a lie.

315
00:17:50.296 --> 00:17:51.796
Then there's no reason for you to struggle.

316
00:17:52.026 --> 00:17:53.766
That's upsetting to hear.

317
00:17:54.467 --> 00:17:55.726
You're so mean.

318
00:17:56.097 --> 00:17:58.066
You've become so cynical.

319
00:17:58.266 --> 00:18:00.736
I was always like this. I guess you didn't know.

320
00:18:00.867 --> 00:18:02.536
Have some interest in me, will you?

321
00:18:06.677 --> 00:18:07.677
Aren't you going to run?

322
00:18:08.707 --> 00:18:10.917
It's important to have a strong will when you run.

323
00:18:11.246 --> 00:18:12.276
I'm going to go first.

324
00:18:14.086 --> 00:18:15.187
I'm going to run!

00:18:53.457 --> 00:18:54.756
- Good Soup. - Look!

331
00:18:54.756 --> 00:18:56.756
- It's Chef On! Chef! - Good Soup.

332
00:19:01.826 --> 00:19:02.897
Did you guys run today?

333
00:19:02.897 --> 00:19:05.566
Yes, Sous-chef said we need to focus...

334
00:19:05.697 --> 00:19:07.637
our mind...

335
00:19:07.766 --> 00:19:10.236
and use that to...

336
00:19:10.877 --> 00:19:12.806
- I don't know. - He's so dumb.

337
00:19:13.036 --> 00:19:14.476
I'm not that dumb.

338
00:19:14.907 --> 00:19:16.046
Hyun Soo.

339
00:19:17.947 --> 00:19:19.016
Is she your sister?

340
00:19:19.016 --> 00:19:21.447
No, she's the writer of "Unruly Detectives".

341
00:19:21.617 --> 00:19:22.786
I told you that I know her.

342
00:19:22.947 --> 00:19:24.516
Oh, really?

343
00:19:24.786 --> 00:19:25.887
Hello.

344
00:19:26.256 --> 00:19:27.586
- Hello. - Hello.

345
00:19:28.157 --> 00:19:30.127
How do you know Chef On?

346
00:19:35.066 --> 00:19:36.197
What should we eat?

347
00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:40.266
- 6... - Sandwiches.

348
00:19:40.867 --> 00:19:42.167
I'd like to order six sandwich combo sets.

349
00:19:42.167 --> 00:19:43.806
- Okay. - Please heat the bread.

350
00:19:43.806 --> 00:19:44.907
Okay.

351
00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:47.947
- Okay. - I like my sandwiches cold.

352
00:19:48.947 --> 00:19:50.177
Then should I ask them not to heat yours?

353
00:19:50.177 --> 00:19:52.046
Don't you think there's something weird about them?

354
00:19:52.046 --> 00:19:53.647
What's so weird about them?

355
00:19:54.117 --> 00:19:55.447
They like each other.

356
00:19:56.046 --> 00:19:57.056
What?

357
00:19:57.056 --> 00:19:58.917
I'm quite sensitive when it comes to these kind of things.

358
00:19:59.786 --> 00:20:01.457
They like each other.

359
00:20:01.927 --> 00:20:03.657
Isn't Chef On way younger than her?

360
00:20:03.657 --> 00:20:05.397
Why does that even matter?

361
00:20:05.526 --> 00:20:07.097
My gosh, I never said it mattered.

362
00:20:07.197 --> 00:20:09.566
I'm just talking about his taste in women.

363
00:20:09.726 --> 00:20:11.066
Then what's his relationship with Hong Ah?

364
00:20:11.367 --> 00:20:12.937
I thought they had something going on.

365
00:20:13.437 --> 00:20:14.766
No, there's definitely nothing going on between them.

366
00:20:15.467 --> 00:20:17.506
Then I'm going to make Hong Ah mine.

367
00:20:17.877 --> 00:20:19.107
Here you go.

368
00:20:19.137 --> 00:20:20.476
Please enjoy.

369
00:20:22.407 --> 00:20:23.647
Here you go.

370
00:20:23.647 --> 00:20:25.347
Were you guys talking about something interesting?

371
00:20:25.476 --> 00:20:26.476
No.

372
00:20:27.516 --> 00:20:29.016
I'm your fan, Ms. Lee.

373
00:20:29.617 --> 00:20:30.816
You're just Shin Ha Rim's fan.

374
00:20:32.117 --> 00:20:33.826
You're really no help at all.

375
00:20:34.326 --> 00:20:36.056
It's okay. I should be grateful.

376
00:20:36.056 --> 00:20:37.226
You're a fan of the actor that appears in my drama.

377
00:20:37.326 --> 00:20:38.697
I hope you keep watching our show.

378
00:20:40.326 --> 00:20:42.496
You're very pretty.

379
00:20:42.726 --> 00:20:44.036
Thank you.

380
00:20:44.036 --> 00:20:45.597
I should accept that before anyone disagrees.

381
00:20:57.316 --> 00:20:58.546
(Hwangbo Kyung is calling you.)

382
00:21:01.387 --> 00:21:02.387
What do you want?

383
00:21:02.816 --> 00:21:04.957
Hey, are you sure you're an assistant writer?

384
00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.586
How can you not show up at all? We're in an emergency right now.

385
00:21:07.826 --> 00:21:09.286
There's nothing to do.

386
00:21:09.526 --> 00:21:11.197
Hyun Soo's going to write everything anyway.

387
00:21:11.197 --> 00:21:14.766
But still, it'll be reassuring if we help her with the script.

388
00:21:15.226 --> 00:21:16.766
She has Mr. Park on her side.

389
00:21:17.697 --> 00:21:19.367
Regardless of what the director says,

390
00:21:19.367 --> 00:21:21.107
the production company is always on her side.

391
00:21:21.107 --> 00:21:23.137
Shut it. Hurry up, and get over here.

392
00:21:24.006 --> 00:21:25.407
I need to go somewhere first.

393
00:21:25.506 --> 00:21:26.506
Where?

394
00:21:27.076 --> 00:21:28.506
It's none of your business.

395
00:21:32.546 --> 00:21:34.617
What is she busy doing?

396
00:21:36.986 --> 00:21:38.556
Can you cook me a bowl of instant noodles?

397
00:21:40.687 --> 00:21:42.726
And why would I do that for you?

398
00:21:42.986 --> 00:21:43.996
Because I'm hungry.

399
00:21:44.496 --> 00:21:47.496
You shouldn't eat instant noodles for breakfast.

400
00:21:47.526 --> 00:21:48.566
Do you have rice?

401
00:21:48.566 --> 00:21:50.496
- Yes. - Then give me some.

402
00:21:50.597 --> 00:21:51.697
Okay.

403
00:21:56.036 --> 00:21:57.377
I fell for it again.

404
00:21:59.476 --> 00:22:02.076
Do you think this is a restaurant or something?

405
00:22:02.107 --> 00:22:04.347
Come on. Let's help each other out.

406
00:22:04.347 --> 00:22:06.516
You're talking about a two-way relationship.

407
00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:08.847
And you should be the one helping me out right now.

408
00:22:08.847 --> 00:22:09.917
You earn 100,000 dollars a year.

409
00:22:09.917 --> 00:22:12.016
There's not much left after tax.

410
00:22:12.016 --> 00:22:14.326
And I know you have to give money to your ex-wife as well.

411
00:22:16.056 --> 00:22:18.957
You're still giving money to your ex-wife.

412
00:22:19.357 --> 00:22:22.496
And yet, you still ask an assistant writer to do things for you.

413
00:22:26.066 --> 00:22:29.637
But why in the world am I actually fixing a meal for you?

414
00:22:29.736 --> 00:22:31.776
Am I mentally ill or something?

415
00:22:33.207 --> 00:22:34.546
Think about it.

416
00:22:34.947 --> 00:22:37.347
You're doing everything for everyone.

417
00:22:37.447 --> 00:22:39.046
You're even just an assistant writer.

418
00:22:40.746 --> 00:22:41.816
You're cute.

419
00:22:45.316 --> 00:22:47.657
You really are a pervert.

420
00:22:48.226 --> 00:22:50.086
Your bad taste in women...

421
00:22:50.086 --> 00:22:52.157
is the reason why you ended up getting married to a weird woman.

422
00:22:52.157 --> 00:22:55.427
And that's why you're still giving money to her.

423
00:23:01.536 --> 00:23:02.967
(In the process of defeating Red Monster)

424
00:23:02.967 --> 00:23:04.306
(Results)

425
00:23:12.246 --> 00:23:15.187
We have eggs here. Do you want me to fry you an egg?

426
00:23:16.887 --> 00:23:18.357
I get hurt too.

427
00:23:18.717 --> 00:23:20.256
Exactly.

428
00:23:21.256 --> 00:23:23.427
That's why I'm asking if you want fried eggs.

429
00:23:25.927 --> 00:23:27.996
Can I have boiled eggs instead?

430
00:23:28.766 --> 00:23:29.766
I'd like two, please.

431
00:23:45.217 --> 00:23:46.776
You can begin telling me why you're here.

432
00:23:53.556 --> 00:23:55.256
They're the scripts I wrote for a daily drama.

433
00:23:56.056 --> 00:23:58.326
I even submitted them to HNC's Writing Contest.

434
00:24:01.266 --> 00:24:04.167
I'd like you to review it and produce the drama.

435
00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:07.967
If you don't sign a contract me, you'll regret it in the future.

436
00:24:11.236 --> 00:24:14.207
I'm intrigued by your groundless confidence.

437
00:24:14.677 --> 00:24:16.347
Hyun Soo's writing lacks popularity.

438
00:24:16.677 --> 00:24:19.717
You already know that. You just choose to produce it anyway.

439
00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:22.887
But I'm a fast writer, and my storyline is more popular.

440
00:24:23.387 --> 00:24:25.556
There's no need to criticize Ms. Lee...

441
00:24:25.816 --> 00:24:27.657
to make yourself stand out.

442
00:24:28.056 --> 00:24:31.526
I've already told Hyun Soo that her writing lacks popularity.

443
00:24:31.657 --> 00:24:33.967
People normally choose to show their good sides...

444
00:24:34.226 --> 00:24:36.937
when they want to make themselves look appealing to someone.

445
00:24:37.536 --> 00:24:39.796
But I chose the opposite of that.

446
00:24:40.266 --> 00:24:41.736
It's intense.

447
00:24:42.167 --> 00:24:43.877
It is intense indeed.

448
00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:47.847
My goal was to have you see my intense desire to succeed...

449
00:24:47.847 --> 00:24:50.546
even if it means squashing a close friend.

450
00:24:51.147 --> 00:24:52.677
You've reached your goal.

451
00:24:53.177 --> 00:24:54.586
And I'll consider it.

452
00:24:55.746 --> 00:24:56.986
Thank you.

453
00:25:07.066 --> 00:25:09.226
Hello. You're early.

454
00:25:09.226 --> 00:25:11.197
Yes. The exhibition is tomorrow.

455
00:25:11.197 --> 00:25:13.066
So I have a couple things to take care of.

456
00:25:13.066 --> 00:25:14.766
Congratulations, Professor Min.

457
00:25:14.766 --> 00:25:16.306
Come see it if you have time.

458
00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:18.536
Sure. Do you want some tea?

459
00:25:18.536 --> 00:25:20.177
Bring it to the terrace.

460
00:25:20.407 --> 00:25:21.806
Is Jung Sun there?

461
00:25:27.746 --> 00:25:29.546
- Are you coming from the shoot? - Yes.

462
00:25:29.947 --> 00:25:32.617
On Jung Sun is going to become a world celebrity now.

463
00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:37.556
My uncle used to love her.

464
00:25:37.957 --> 00:25:39.397
She's still exactly the same.

465
00:25:40.127 --> 00:25:41.496
What dish are you making?

466
00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:42.597
They won't tell me.

467
00:25:42.597 --> 00:25:44.637
I thought it was all pre-arranged,

468
00:25:44.637 --> 00:25:45.937
but this is hard.

469
00:25:46.496 --> 00:25:48.566
Who do you think the other French chef is?

470
00:25:48.607 --> 00:25:50.677
It must be someone we know. It's a small field.

471
00:25:50.677 --> 00:25:52.536
Get me a list of potential dishes...

472
00:25:52.536 --> 00:25:53.907
Lee Deul Lae might like.

473
00:25:53.907 --> 00:25:55.647
I want to at least know her taste.

474
00:25:55.647 --> 00:25:56.806
Yes, Chef.

475
00:26:01.986 --> 00:26:04.617
What's going on with Hyun Soo? Are you two dating?

476
00:26:04.687 --> 00:26:07.657
No. Concentration and choice.

477
00:26:07.657 --> 00:26:09.286
Right now, I'm choosing Good Soup.

478
00:26:09.286 --> 00:26:11.197
I'm concentrating on Good Soup.

479
00:26:11.197 --> 00:26:12.957
What if she slips away?

480
00:26:13.457 --> 00:26:15.066
She's already slipped away once.

481
00:26:15.397 --> 00:26:17.697
So I'm not going to start things easily this time.

482
00:26:22.137 --> 00:26:23.167
Hello.

483
00:26:23.937 --> 00:26:25.377
You get more charming every time I see you.

484
00:26:25.377 --> 00:26:27.546
- Are you working out? - Yes.

485
00:26:28.107 --> 00:26:29.147
Have a seat.

486
00:26:32.877 --> 00:26:34.546
Soo Jung told me.

487
00:26:34.546 --> 00:26:35.986
You're going to be on TV?

488
00:26:36.286 --> 00:26:37.387
Yes.

489
00:26:37.387 --> 00:26:39.417
You'll get famous once it airs.

490
00:26:39.486 --> 00:26:41.486
You're young and handsome.

491
00:26:42.256 --> 00:26:44.226
It's like I'm seeing my youth.

492
00:26:45.457 --> 00:26:47.066
You still hold your own.

493
00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:50.496
I like handsome men.

494
00:26:50.697 --> 00:26:52.667
Jung Sun's dad was handsome,

495
00:26:52.667 --> 00:26:55.306
and all the men I met before were handsome too.

496
00:27:00.506 --> 00:27:02.947
You should really thank me.

497
00:27:02.947 --> 00:27:05.447
Who do you think gave you your looks?

498
00:27:06.447 --> 00:27:07.947
Are you going to stay for lunch?

499
00:27:07.947 --> 00:27:10.957
Yes. We came at this time on purpose to eat lunch here.

500
00:27:10.957 --> 00:27:12.256
After this cup of tea.

501
00:27:12.717 --> 00:27:14.457
Then enjoy your lunch, and do your thing.

502
00:27:14.586 --> 00:27:15.756
Oh, right.

503
00:27:16.026 --> 00:27:17.726
Thank you, every time.

504
00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:23.796
Why do you bother to say that?

505
00:27:23.796 --> 00:27:25.437
He doesn't like hearing those things.

506
00:27:25.437 --> 00:27:27.236
I shouldn't be like that.

507
00:27:27.236 --> 00:27:29.107
I have to pay my dues.

508
00:27:29.107 --> 00:27:31.236
I told you that it's okay.

509
00:27:32.207 --> 00:27:35.046
Honey, this isn't right.

510
00:27:35.576 --> 00:27:37.147
Why aren't you letting me say what I want?

511
00:27:37.147 --> 00:27:38.617
In front of your son at that.

512
00:27:38.617 --> 00:27:41.516
It's not that I'm not letting you. It's just unnecessary.

513
00:27:42.246 --> 00:27:44.187
That's for me to decide.

514
00:27:46.657 --> 00:27:48.157
I'm sure this is uncomfortable for you.

515
00:27:48.357 --> 00:27:51.256
You're an adult too now, so I think you'll understand.

516
00:27:53.726 --> 00:27:55.796
I wanted to say thank you.

517
00:27:55.796 --> 00:27:58.967
It was very thoughtful of you to do that for every exhibition,

518
00:27:58.967 --> 00:28:00.806
so I had to express my thanks.

519
00:28:03.637 --> 00:28:05.076
Don't you know what I'm saying?

520
00:28:05.276 --> 00:28:06.976
No, it's fine.

521
00:28:07.476 --> 00:28:08.546
It's fine?

522
00:28:15.246 --> 00:28:16.286
What's wrong?

523
00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:19.687
Where did you get the money?

524
00:28:19.957 --> 00:28:21.627
Jung Sun didn't send it, did he?

525
00:28:21.627 --> 00:28:24.326
Why did you lie? Why are you treating me like an idiot?

526
00:28:24.496 --> 00:28:26.026
I made a fool of myself in front of Jung Sin.

527
00:28:26.026 --> 00:28:27.167
It's Jung Sun.

528
00:28:28.597 --> 00:28:31.496
- What? - It's Jung Sun, not Jung Sin.

529
00:28:32.197 --> 00:28:35.667
You can't change my son's name just because you're mad.

530
00:28:37.407 --> 00:28:39.937
Fine. Jung Sun, Jung Sun, Jung Sun, Jung Sun.

531
00:28:41.576 --> 00:28:44.576
People who love each other can't lie to one another.

532
00:28:45.217 --> 00:28:48.147
I didn't lie. I just switched things up.

533
00:28:48.647 --> 00:28:50.217
Mr. Park sent it.

534
00:28:50.217 --> 00:28:53.857
Mr. Park and Jung Sun are practically brothers.

535
00:28:53.857 --> 00:28:55.857
So you said they were from your son...

536
00:28:55.857 --> 00:28:57.326
to boost his dignity?

537
00:28:57.697 --> 00:28:58.957
Then what about me?

538
00:28:58.957 --> 00:29:00.326
Why aren't you boosting my dignity?

539
00:29:00.326 --> 00:29:02.127
I am boosting your dignity.

540
00:29:02.127 --> 00:29:03.867
I'm even involving my son's senior.

541
00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:05.197
What more can I do?

542
00:29:06.236 --> 00:29:07.266
I'm still mad at you.

543
00:29:07.266 --> 00:29:09.536
Honey, you're strange.

544
00:29:09.536 --> 00:29:11.236
You get mad at the weirdest times.

545
00:29:11.236 --> 00:29:14.046
You're getting mad after eating the whole meal, not right after?

546
00:29:14.506 --> 00:29:16.447
I still have to eat.

547
00:29:17.576 --> 00:29:18.746
I'm going on my own.

548
00:29:23.617 --> 00:29:26.927
How hardworking of me to consider him a man and take him in.

549
00:29:43.036 --> 00:29:44.707
Of course you won't let this go.

550
00:29:52.316 --> 00:29:53.717
You're hard to deal with.

551
00:29:54.187 --> 00:29:56.986
I feel like the teacher just caught me doing something wrong.

552
00:29:56.986 --> 00:29:59.516
Don't try to weasel out of this.

553
00:29:59.516 --> 00:30:02.556
I thought for a second about you could borrow money from.

554
00:30:02.556 --> 00:30:04.796
The worst is someone I know.

555
00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:06.357
I just hope it's not that.

556
00:30:06.756 --> 00:30:08.627
That's not it.

557
00:30:08.627 --> 00:30:11.137
Why would I borrow money from someone you know?

558
00:30:11.437 --> 00:30:13.137
Daniel gives me money.

559
00:30:13.536 --> 00:30:16.006
Professors don't get paid a lot, but he gives me some.

560
00:30:17.177 --> 00:30:18.707
I have some saved up.

561
00:30:19.107 --> 00:30:21.006
Do you really need a man?

562
00:30:24.776 --> 00:30:26.617
Are you going to live with me forever then?

563
00:30:26.717 --> 00:30:28.187
Can't you just live on your own?

564
00:30:29.816 --> 00:30:31.056
I don't want to live by myself.

565
00:30:32.187 --> 00:30:33.957
You don't want to live with me,

566
00:30:34.157 --> 00:30:35.657
but men are different.

567
00:30:36.286 --> 00:30:38.326
Even if it's for a little while, they love me.

568
00:30:38.597 --> 00:30:40.197
At a very high temperature at that.

569
00:30:41.097 --> 00:30:43.637
You got burned last time, but you're still going on about it?

570
00:30:43.637 --> 00:30:45.766
So you won't ferment the paste because you're scared of maggots?

571
00:30:45.996 --> 00:30:47.806
Men and women live together...

572
00:30:47.806 --> 00:30:49.637
from the heat they once shared.

573
00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:52.536
All relationships are bland.

574
00:30:53.036 --> 00:30:54.306
But with a man,

575
00:30:55.276 --> 00:30:56.877
at least momentarily, it's burning hot.

576
00:30:58.217 --> 00:31:01.387
All right. This conversation won't get us anywhere.

577
00:31:01.786 --> 00:31:04.486
Now tell me. Who lent you the money?

578
00:31:05.086 --> 00:31:08.556
I told you I didn't borrow money. Why can't you trust your own mother?

579
00:31:13.597 --> 00:31:17.137
(Episode 12 will air shortly.)
