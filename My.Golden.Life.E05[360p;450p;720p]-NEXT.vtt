1
00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:09.359
I'm sorry, Ji Tae.

2
00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:11.628
And you too, Ji Soo.

3
00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:19.036
I'm sorry, Mom.

4
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.175
(Episode 5)

5
00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:30.047
I'll move into that house.

6
00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:35.018
What do you mean by
moving into that house?

7
00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:43.860
I'll move to
my parents' house.

8
00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.469
Parents' house?

9
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.473
What do you mean?
Are you joking?

10
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.041
Did you make up your mind?

11
00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:59.609
Stop it, Mom.

12
00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:03.346
Mother.

13
00:01:04.214 --> 00:01:05.215
Ji An.

14
00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:08.919
Ji Tae...

15
00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:13.757
Do you remember staying
at my mom's house...

16
00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:16.259
before we left for Dubai?

17
00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:18.562
Before we left for Dubai?

18
00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:22.099
The time you lived
with Father...

19
00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.134
because you were sick?

20
00:01:25.368 --> 00:01:26.670
There was an accident...

21
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:29.339
at that time.

22
00:01:30.474 --> 00:01:31.975
I'll tell them, Mom.

23
00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:34.611
At that time,

24
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:38.148
Ji Soo's twin had died.

25
00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:45.055
And they found me
before moving to Dubai.

26
00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.091
They thought
I was abandoned.

27
00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:49.893
Right, Mom?

28
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.662
What...
What do you mean she died?

29
00:01:54.064 --> 00:01:56.032
Do you mean Ji An died?

30
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:57.734
No way.

31
00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:00.971
Are you saying...

32
00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:04.274
you're not my real sister?

33
00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.812
I don't know how they
did it, but they found me,

34
00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:10.147
and we met.

35
00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:14.417
So I decided to move
into their house.

36
00:02:14.784 --> 00:02:16.786
You met them? Already?

37
00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:18.054
When?

38
00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:22.025
Did they ask you
to move in?

39
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.529
What are their jobs?

40
00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:27.497
Actually...

41
00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:29.499
They're from
Haesung Corporation.

42
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.402
The company in which
Ji An worked on contract.

43
00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.803
- Haesung Corporation?
- Haesung Corporation?

44
00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:36.773
She has made up her mind.

45
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.408
Respect her decision.

46
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.549
We're not twins?

47
00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:48.785
You're not my sister?

48
00:02:54.824 --> 00:02:55.959
Mom.

49
00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:01.631
I'm sorry, Mom.

50
00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:05.135
You shouldn't apologize.
It had to be done.

51
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.572
I know you're
disappointed.

52
00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:14.911
Mom. Is it true?

53
00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:17.781
Is she really not
my sister?

54
00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:20.283
It doesn't make sense.

55
00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:23.386
How can she
not be my sister?

56
00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:25.055
Ji Soo.

57
00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.424
How can we not be twins?

58
00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:29.926
So the real Ji An is dead?

59
00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.563
No way. You're lying,
aren't you, Mom?

60
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.365
Don't be so stubborn.

61
00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:38.468
Finish your meal.
You have to go to work.

62
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.771
Let's go, okay?

63
00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:44.574
What do you mean you're
moving to their house?

64
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:46.943
Why would you go there?

65
00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.282
Let's go.
Let's talk outside, okay?

66
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.021
The workers are here.

67
00:03:58.622 --> 00:04:00.190
Why are they here
so early?

68
00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.625
I called them...

69
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:03.660
to finish working
on Eun Seok's room.

70
00:04:04.194 --> 00:04:06.830
Mother, did Eun Seok
decide to come?

71
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.967
Not yet. But she
might come soon.

72
00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.869
She might not
move in at all.

73
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.204
Let's not
get our hopes up.

74
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:17.374
There's nothing you can do
if she says no, right?

75
00:04:17.474 --> 00:04:19.142
I'm just saying,
we should give her...

76
00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:20.644
some time
with that family.

77
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.212
I can't let her stay
in that house.

78
00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.782
She wouldn't say no. That
family isn't doing well.

79
00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.085
Tell them to
finish the floor...

80
00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:31.221
so that we can have
the furniture in tomorrow.

81
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:32.222
Okay.

82
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.529
(Yang Mi Jung)

83
00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:45.835
Hello. It's No Myung Hee.

84
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:51.007
Go ahead.
I know who's calling.

85
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:55.578
She'll come?

86
00:05:01.251 --> 00:05:02.319
Okay.

87
00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.887
I'm in the middle of
having breakfast.

88
00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.088
I'll call you back later.

89
00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:08.825
Mother.

90
00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:11.027
Is Eun Seok coming?

91
00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:13.530
Yes.

92
00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:15.832
She said she'll come.

93
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.268
Eun Seok said...

94
00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.837
she'll come?

95
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.206
Already?
When is she coming?

96
00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:08.151
But...

97
00:06:09.152 --> 00:06:10.687
why couldn't they...

98
00:06:11.254 --> 00:06:12.956
find you until now?

99
00:06:14.257 --> 00:06:15.959
I didn't hear about that.

100
00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.460
I said everything I know.

101
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.195
So you probably...

102
00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:21.264
don't know the details.

103
00:06:21.564 --> 00:06:24.834
Is that what you want to
know? She's moving out.

104
00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.506
Ji Ho, aren't you sad
about Ji An leaving?

105
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.640
Me?

106
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.515
I'm okay.

107
00:06:38.882 --> 00:06:41.451
Even if you leave,
you're still my sister.

108
00:06:41.718 --> 00:06:43.453
- Hey...
- Ji Soo.

109
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.522
It's time for Ji An
to live on her own.

110
00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:48.958
Ji Tae, what about you?

111
00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:51.327
Are you okay with
Ji An leaving?

112
00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.464
I need to go to work.
Let's talk about it later.

113
00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:56.499
Although there's nothing
to talk about.

114
00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:58.701
What do you mean there's
nothing to talk about?

115
00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:01.638
She's an adult. She made
the decision herself.

116
00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:04.007
It's not like we'll never
see her again.

117
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.376
What's wrong with you all?

118
00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:09.446
I'm just living
in a different house.

119
00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:11.514
I understand
their situation too.

120
00:07:11.948 --> 00:07:13.583
We're already family.

121
00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:16.052
I'm just getting
one more family.

122
00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:18.087
It's not like I'm out
of this family.

123
00:07:18.822 --> 00:07:20.890
Just think about it
that way.

124
00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:25.195
Aren't you going to work,
Ji Soo?

125
00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:28.264
Ji Tae should go to work,
and Ji Ho should go study.

126
00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:31.201
See you later.

127
00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:51.821
What's wrong?

128
00:07:52.455 --> 00:07:54.390
Are you feeling okay?

129
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:57.827
Did you cry?

130
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:01.331
I retched because I
thought I had indigestion.

131
00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:12.342
- Are you okay, Father?
- Are you okay?

132
00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:13.943
I'm fine.

133
00:08:14.277 --> 00:08:17.213
I suddenly had indigestion
upon hearing the news.

134
00:08:18.214 --> 00:08:20.683
It's been a while
since I saw you smile.

135
00:08:21.384 --> 00:08:22.886
Do Kyung and Seo Hyun,

136
00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:24.687
you two must
help Eun Seok...

137
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.190
to make her our family
as fast as possible.

138
00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.261
Don't tell anyone else
that we found Eun Seok.

139
00:08:31.528 --> 00:08:34.697
Nobody should know before
our official announcement.

140
00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.833
What do you mean by an
official announcement?

141
00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:39.068
We need to give Eun Seok
time to adjust.

142
00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.438
Okay. We will do our best.

143
00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:45.708
The media will probably
make gossip out of her...

144
00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:49.112
about returning
after 25 years.

145
00:08:49.245 --> 00:08:50.980
What are you
going to do then?

146
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.484
We'll handle it.
Just make sure you behave.

147
00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:57.554
There's been a lot of
issues with conglomerates.

148
00:08:57.921 --> 00:08:59.455
There's a rumor that
the media is after us.

149
00:08:59.656 --> 00:09:01.190
I've heard about that too.

150
00:09:01.925 --> 00:09:03.226
Once they find out
about Eun Seok,

151
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.162
you two will be mentioned
as well.

152
00:09:06.162 --> 00:09:07.797
Let me know when you
come up with a plan.

153
00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:10.366
I can't wait to meet
Eun Seok.

154
00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.602
I was curious...

155
00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:15.204
about her name
and where she worked,

156
00:09:15.538 --> 00:09:17.340
but I didn't ask
since you didn't tell us.

157
00:09:18.107 --> 00:09:19.742
I want to know what
kind of person she became.

158
00:09:20.944 --> 00:09:22.178
She's a good girl.

159
00:09:23.046 --> 00:09:26.115
She grew up well even in
a difficult environment.

160
00:09:33.923 --> 00:09:37.860
Could you
lend me 20,000 dollars?

161
00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:41.297
(No Myung Hee
20,000 dollars)

162
00:09:42.966 --> 00:09:44.467
Send me your
account details,

163
00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:45.835
and check
five minutes later.

164
00:09:48.204 --> 00:09:49.706
20,000 dollars...

165
00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:52.709
has been given
as if it were 20 dollars.

166
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.745
Stop putting on a show...

167
00:09:55.745 --> 00:09:57.614
if you won't pay
the full 20,700 dollars.

168
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.722
She's always on time.
Why is she late today?

169
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:46.696
You're 10 minutes late.

170
00:10:47.463 --> 00:10:48.464
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.707
Are... Are you crying now?

172
00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:01.244
I'm just going
through something now.

173
00:11:05.448 --> 00:11:07.684
That's none
of my business.

174
00:11:08.184 --> 00:11:09.452
Return after you're done.

175
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.187
Okay.

176
00:11:14.323 --> 00:11:16.325
(Haesung Corporation)

177
00:11:19.062 --> 00:11:21.197
(Mr. Choi proved to be
capable with new...)

178
00:11:21.197 --> 00:11:23.332
(strategies and received
positive evaluations.)

179
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:28.237
(Senior Manager,
Choi Do Kyung)

180
00:11:31.074 --> 00:11:32.842
She had a brother who's
the same age as me.

181
00:11:34.243 --> 00:11:37.080
What is the season now?

182
00:11:37.346 --> 00:11:39.182
It's autumn.
It's September now.

183
00:11:39.182 --> 00:11:41.851
Is it really autumn when
it's this hot outside?

184
00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:43.486
I agree.

185
00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:45.455
It's September, but it's
still so hot outside.

186
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:46.789
I guess it's still summer.

187
00:11:46.856 --> 00:11:49.225
If it's still summer, why
is your main display...

188
00:11:49.225 --> 00:11:52.161
- a heavy coat?
- Pardon?

189
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:53.963
You say that you're
in the apparel business.

190
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.365
But how can you be aware
of only four seasons?

191
00:11:58.534 --> 00:12:01.304
We're going under
a change of seasons.

192
00:12:01.938 --> 00:12:04.974
A midterm season before
the next season arrives.

193
00:12:06.175 --> 00:12:07.610
This is not listed
in dictionaries.

194
00:12:07.944 --> 00:12:10.813
But there is a report of
this newly-coined word...

195
00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.682
by the National Academy
of the Korean Language.

196
00:12:13.116 --> 00:12:14.417
I see.

197
00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:17.487
Look at this.

198
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.722
Why is this jacket
hiding here?

199
00:12:19.722 --> 00:12:22.658
This is the perfect jacket
clients want at this time.

200
00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.428
Change the display
with this jacket.

201
00:12:25.428 --> 00:12:26.562
Yes, sir.

202
00:12:26.562 --> 00:12:28.464
Can I take a look
at that jacket?

203
00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:31.567
Why would you take
a look at the jacket?

204
00:12:31.868 --> 00:12:34.670
This is made
for you to wear.

205
00:12:36.806 --> 00:12:39.242
This jacket's concept
focuses on the mobility.

206
00:12:39.242 --> 00:12:41.944
It's light and thin,
so it is easy to carry.

207
00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:44.847
When you wear this at
night or for an occasion,

208
00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:46.816
you'll look great.

209
00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:49.218
The jacket fits
you perfectly.

210
00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:53.189
- Hello.
- Hi.

211
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:56.192
I'm the one who owes
you 20,700 dollars.

212
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.193
(Assailant)

213
00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.195
Why did you call me?

214
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.065
Hold on.

215
00:13:05.668 --> 00:13:08.604
I answered because I did
not check the caller ID.

216
00:13:08.938 --> 00:13:11.340
Why do I have to
talk with you?

217
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.842
I'm working now.

218
00:13:12.842 --> 00:13:13.943
I...

219
00:13:13.943 --> 00:13:15.678
What? What is it
this time?

220
00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:19.182
I called you because we
have unfinished business.

221
00:13:19.182 --> 00:13:20.983
I don't think we do.

222
00:13:20.983 --> 00:13:22.318
I have
unfinished business.

223
00:13:22.318 --> 00:13:23.586
I don't.

224
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.055
You didn't even hear
what I'm talking about.

225
00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:28.090
Do you have
a terrible memory?

226
00:13:28.324 --> 00:13:31.594
I said we have nothing
to discuss last night.

227
00:13:31.594 --> 00:13:33.596
That settlement
was one-sided.

228
00:13:33.596 --> 00:13:35.665
I have something
I need to take care of.

229
00:13:36.599 --> 00:13:38.201
I will give you the 5,000.

230
00:13:38.668 --> 00:13:40.570
Are you talking
about 5,000 dollars?

231
00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:42.171
Forget it.

232
00:13:42.171 --> 00:13:43.806
I wasn't referring
to 5,000 dollars.

233
00:13:44.207 --> 00:13:45.308
I'm hanging up.

234
00:13:45.308 --> 00:13:46.909
I'll hang up and block
your number. Don't...

235
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:48.611
Aren't you a member
of N-Gaon?

236
00:13:50.112 --> 00:13:52.248
Should I visit you
at work?

237
00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:56.652
Are... Are you
threatening me?

238
00:13:56.719 --> 00:13:57.987
You're working
out of your office now?

239
00:13:57.987 --> 00:13:59.956
Where are you? Why don't
I meet you there?

240
00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:02.191
It won't take long.
I need only three minutes.

241
00:14:02.191 --> 00:14:03.292
What...

242
00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:07.563
Okay. I'll see you there
in 30 minutes.

243
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.401
Hello.

244
00:14:15.404 --> 00:14:17.807
In what form would you
like the 20,700 dollars?

245
00:14:19.242 --> 00:14:20.576
Would you like them
in checks?

246
00:14:23.312 --> 00:14:24.947
I wasn't referring
to 5,000 dollars.

247
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:27.817
There's nothing we need to
discuss except that.

248
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.219
Should I visit you
at work?

249
00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.455
I knew I had a bad
feeling about this.

250
00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:35.224
It looked like
she knew who I was.

251
00:14:35.691 --> 00:14:37.960
Just make sure you behave.

252
00:14:38.194 --> 00:14:40.830
There's been a lot of
issues with conglomerates.

253
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.832
There's a rumor that
the media is after us.

254
00:14:43.532 --> 00:14:45.034
I shouldn't have called
her to Yangpyeong.

255
00:14:45.034 --> 00:14:47.670
I shouldn't have. I gave
her something to chew on.

256
00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:01.050
Hello. I'm here.

257
00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:09.325
Please tell me
what this is about.

258
00:15:09.692 --> 00:15:11.060
You're not going
to get off?

259
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.729
I'm quite busy.

260
00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:17.800
I must hurry off after
hearing what you say.

261
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.101
All right then.

262
00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:20.469
Take this.

263
00:15:21.237 --> 00:15:23.205
- What is this?
- See it for yourself.

264
00:15:23.205 --> 00:15:25.608
Why would I do that?

265
00:15:25.608 --> 00:15:27.243
This is what I wanted
to give you.

266
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.577
Take a look.

267
00:15:29.445 --> 00:15:30.446
What is this?

268
00:15:34.083 --> 00:15:36.452
- What's all this money?
- The 20,700 dollars.

269
00:15:36.452 --> 00:15:38.321
Count them, and
give me the receipt.

270
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:40.556
Why did you pay me
in 50-dollar bills?

271
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.391
And what do you mean by
a receipt?

272
00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:44.460
Should I just give you
20,700 dollars without...

273
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.095
checking how much
the repairs cost?

274
00:15:46.095 --> 00:15:49.231
I... I already got rid
of that car.

275
00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:50.733
I changed it to this car.

276
00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:52.234
I don't care about that.

277
00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:54.470
You do what you want
with your property.

278
00:15:54.837 --> 00:15:56.439
Then give me the estimate
for the repairs.

279
00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:58.441
Right! And check
the money first.

280
00:15:58.808 --> 00:16:00.710
Do you want me
to count these here?

281
00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:03.813
However,

282
00:16:05.114 --> 00:16:06.215
where did you get
this money?

283
00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:07.616
I gave you what I owe you.

284
00:16:07.616 --> 00:16:08.951
Count them, and
give me the estimate.

285
00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:11.220
Where did you get it? You
didn't have it last night.

286
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.588
Just count the bills.

287
00:16:14.357 --> 00:16:16.392
Did you take out
a private loan?

288
00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.361
Oh, I almost forgot.

289
00:16:21.464 --> 00:16:22.865
100 dollars
for the trunk show,

290
00:16:22.865 --> 00:16:24.467
80 dollars for the
round-trip taxi fares,

291
00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:25.568
10 dollars
for the laundry,

292
00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:27.069
and 10 dollars for the
dinner I couldn't eat.

293
00:16:27.703 --> 00:16:29.171
I can take out
200 dollars, right?

294
00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:32.241
Count if it's
20,500 dollars.

295
00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:33.809
What in the world...

296
00:16:36.946 --> 00:16:38.347
Where did you
get this money?

297
00:16:38.347 --> 00:16:40.082
You said you were busy.
So just count them...

298
00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:42.318
I don't need to.
I won't accept this.

299
00:16:42.318 --> 00:16:43.652
- Why not?
- Because I already...

300
00:16:43.652 --> 00:16:45.721
decided that
I won't accept it.

301
00:16:45.955 --> 00:16:48.324
Keep your pride at the
expense you can handle.

302
00:16:49.492 --> 00:16:50.826
- What?
- I get that your pride...

303
00:16:50.826 --> 00:16:53.195
was bruised from the trunk
show and last night.

304
00:16:53.195 --> 00:16:55.197
But how can you
be so reckless?

305
00:16:55.197 --> 00:16:58.167
Go, and return this money.
You can save the interest.

306
00:17:00.236 --> 00:17:02.304
I didn't take out
a private loan.

307
00:17:03.706 --> 00:17:05.041
Don't worry, and take it.

308
00:17:05.041 --> 00:17:07.977
If not, who would give
this to someone like you?

309
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:09.612
"Someone like me?"

310
00:17:10.246 --> 00:17:11.647
What kind of person am I?

311
00:17:11.647 --> 00:17:13.082
I... I mean...

312
00:17:13.082 --> 00:17:14.350
A shameless girl
who's polite...

313
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.619
for 20,000 dollars, but
haughty for 5,000 dollars?

314
00:17:16.719 --> 00:17:19.555
A beggar who bowed down
when you cleared my debts?

315
00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:22.191
What else? The more you
know me, the worse I am?

316
00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:24.927
It was you who caused
that misunderstanding.

317
00:17:24.927 --> 00:17:25.928
Don't you remember?

318
00:17:25.928 --> 00:17:28.197
You provided the cause
for the misunderstanding.

319
00:17:28.197 --> 00:17:29.231
Don't you remember?

320
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:31.200
How you called me to
Yangpyeong, used me there,

321
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.401
and then abandoned me?

322
00:17:32.401 --> 00:17:33.469
I said I had...

323
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:35.371
I bet something
urgent came up.

324
00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:36.972
When something urgent
happens to you,

325
00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:39.542
can I not be mad of
whatever happens to me?

326
00:17:40.176 --> 00:17:42.912
Why? Because
you gave me a break?

327
00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:45.548
Because you lowered the
repair fee to 5,000?

328
00:17:45.714 --> 00:17:48.250
Because you alone
decided not to accept...

329
00:17:48.517 --> 00:17:50.352
the money from me?

330
00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:52.655
But when I got upset, you
thought I was arrogant.

331
00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.223
You thought how someone
like me could get mad?

332
00:17:54.223 --> 00:17:57.193
So you told me to pay
20,000 to trample over me.

333
00:17:57.193 --> 00:18:00.162
How can you say you did it
out of noblesse oblige?

334
00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:02.098
Did... Did you just say...

335
00:18:02.098 --> 00:18:04.433
that I trampled over you?

336
00:18:04.433 --> 00:18:08.704
You weren't doing
me a favor.

337
00:18:08.704 --> 00:18:09.705
What do you mean?

338
00:18:09.705 --> 00:18:12.308
My life is a series
of favors I do for others.

339
00:18:13.109 --> 00:18:14.977
You're taking credit
with your parents' money.

340
00:18:14.977 --> 00:18:16.946
- That was pathetic.
- Hey!

341
00:18:16.946 --> 00:18:19.281
- Don't be so rude.
- What?

342
00:18:19.281 --> 00:18:21.851
You told me to pay back if
I wanted to be arrogant.

343
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:24.019
So I'm being arrogant
after I paid you back.

344
00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.287
How dare you be so rude!

345
00:18:25.287 --> 00:18:26.956
Goodness, I...

346
00:18:26.956 --> 00:18:29.525
You're going too far with
the money you borrowed.

347
00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:31.427
Know your limit when I'm
getting off your back.

348
00:18:31.427 --> 00:18:33.929
Stop letting your ego
do all the talking.

349
00:18:33.929 --> 00:18:35.931
No. Just tell me where
you got this money.

350
00:18:35.931 --> 00:18:37.399
I'll only accept it then.

351
00:18:37.399 --> 00:18:38.667
Why would I tell you that?

352
00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:40.970
A loan, organ donation,
or working at a bar.

353
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.204
It's none of your concern.

354
00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:44.707
A loan, organ donation,
and working at a bar?

355
00:18:45.007 --> 00:18:47.409
I won't ask for the repair
estimate. Just go.

356
00:18:47.409 --> 00:18:48.611
Hey... Hey!

357
00:18:48.611 --> 00:18:49.612
Goodness.

358
00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:53.182
My bad. I just
meant to tap.

359
00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:57.686
Why are you pushing it?

360
00:18:57.686 --> 00:18:59.155
I said I'll let you off.

361
00:18:59.155 --> 00:19:01.524
Why are you pushing it?

362
00:19:01.524 --> 00:19:03.125
I said I'll give
it to you.

363
00:19:05.294 --> 00:19:06.462
I can't talk with you.

364
00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.098
Let's stop this nonsense.

365
00:19:09.098 --> 00:19:10.966
I get it now.

366
00:19:10.966 --> 00:19:12.801
So please take
this money back.

367
00:19:13.936 --> 00:19:15.304
Do I still look
like a beggar to you?

368
00:19:15.304 --> 00:19:17.439
It was you who
caused all of this.

369
00:19:17.439 --> 00:19:19.708
And I don't make people
go above their means.

370
00:19:19.708 --> 00:19:21.243
I can only accept this if
I know you can afford to.

371
00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:24.013
You'll ruin your life just
to keep your pride intact.

372
00:19:26.448 --> 00:19:27.516
Hey.

373
00:19:29.118 --> 00:19:30.386
Hey!

374
00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:35.991
This is my
sincere request.

375
00:19:35.991 --> 00:19:38.394
Let's not see each
other ever again.

376
00:19:38.894 --> 00:19:39.929
Okay.

377
00:19:41.463 --> 00:19:42.731
That's more like it.

378
00:19:45.801 --> 00:19:48.137
This is my
sincere request.

379
00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:50.706
Think why I brought
you 20,000 dollars...

380
00:19:50.706 --> 00:19:53.142
as you count these bills.

381
00:19:56.979 --> 00:19:59.982
Hey! Stop right there.

382
00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:01.750
Hey.

383
00:20:03.052 --> 00:20:04.119
Gosh.

384
00:20:06.388 --> 00:20:07.957
Hey, you!

385
00:20:08.724 --> 00:20:09.792
Seriously.

386
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:11.126
Hey!

387
00:20:13.195 --> 00:20:14.296
I can't believe this.

388
00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:20.803
(Victim)

389
00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:22.638
(Are you sure you want to
delete this phone number?)

390
00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:28.043
- Let's go for lunch.
- Okay.

391
00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:31.380
-Let's go.
- Gosh, I'm hungry.

392
00:20:33.849 --> 00:20:36.552
Hello?
Why did you call me?

393
00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:38.754
You rarely call me first.

394
00:20:39.388 --> 00:20:41.357
Did you have lunch yet?

395
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.927
Not yet. It's only noon.
I was about to have lunch.

396
00:20:45.427 --> 00:20:48.964
Then have lunch with me.
I'm in Daejeon right now.

397
00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:52.301
You... You're in Daejeon?

398
00:21:02.444 --> 00:21:05.948
Are you going through
puberty or something?

399
00:21:06.148 --> 00:21:08.250
You came here just to
have lunch with me?

400
00:21:08.717 --> 00:21:12.054
Are you hungry? I heard
this restaurant serves...

401
00:21:12.054 --> 00:21:13.722
good rice and soup.

402
00:21:14.023 --> 00:21:17.126
Don't be absurd. Let's
eat something you like.

403
00:21:17.293 --> 00:21:19.928
I booked the most popular
restaurant in Daejeon.

404
00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:21.764
Let's just eat here.

405
00:21:21.964 --> 00:21:24.600
It's okay. It takes only
three minutes by taxi.

406
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:42.051
Why aren't you eating
the marinated crab?

407
00:21:42.251 --> 00:21:44.987
You eat two bowls of rice
with marinated crabs.

408
00:21:46.021 --> 00:21:47.690
I don't feel like eating.

409
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:49.892
Why not?

410
00:21:52.594 --> 00:21:55.464
I guess you have
something to tell me.

411
00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:57.166
Go ahead.

412
00:21:58.267 --> 00:22:00.102
Just eat. I'll tell you
once you are done.

413
00:22:01.203 --> 00:22:03.138
I knew you were
acting strange.

414
00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:06.542
You weren't here to give
some side dishes for me.

415
00:22:07.042 --> 00:22:08.110
Tell me.

416
00:22:08.944 --> 00:22:11.513
You'll lose your appetite
once you hear it.

417
00:22:11.513 --> 00:22:14.216
I'll have an upset stomach
if I hear it after eating.

418
00:22:14.216 --> 00:22:15.250
Just tell me.

419
00:22:18.787 --> 00:22:19.822
Tae Soo.

420
00:22:22.291 --> 00:22:23.492
I...

421
00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:27.162
made a huge mistake.

422
00:22:29.698 --> 00:22:31.100
Did you borrow money
from Hae Ja?

423
00:22:32.468 --> 00:22:33.502
Then what?

424
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:40.442
It turns out...

425
00:22:42.344 --> 00:22:43.979
that they didn't
abandon her.

426
00:22:45.848 --> 00:22:47.015
The child...

427
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.618
Someone kidnapped her...

428
00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:52.688
and abandoned her
after taking her jewels.

429
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:58.594
What are you talking
about? I don't understand.

430
00:22:58.761 --> 00:22:59.962
I'm talking about Ji Soo.

431
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.698
Her birth mother
came to me.

432
00:23:04.199 --> 00:23:05.801
Ji Soo's birth mother?

433
00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:10.672
What?

434
00:23:10.672 --> 00:23:11.774
But...

435
00:23:14.276 --> 00:23:16.011
I told her it was Ji An.

436
00:23:18.447 --> 00:23:19.882
Wait a second.

437
00:23:20.716 --> 00:23:23.252
Ji Soo's birth mother
came to you,

438
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.654
but you said
her daughter is Ji An?

439
00:23:25.954 --> 00:23:27.256
What are you
talking about?

440
00:23:27.556 --> 00:23:30.025
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

441
00:23:30.025 --> 00:23:31.727
Tell me in a way
I can understand.

442
00:23:42.104 --> 00:23:44.173
I printed out
an article about it.

443
00:23:45.874 --> 00:23:47.443
This was her.

444
00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:51.246
(The daughter of Haesung
Corporation is missing.)

445
00:23:51.713 --> 00:23:53.215
She was their daughter.

446
00:23:54.383 --> 00:23:55.617
Haesung Corporation.

447
00:23:56.251 --> 00:23:57.953
Ji Soo is...

448
00:24:00.022 --> 00:24:01.457
their daughter?

449
00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:05.961
Was it Seo Tae Soo?
The man who took Eun Seok.

450
00:24:08.464 --> 00:24:10.132
What about Seo Tae Soo?

451
00:24:10.766 --> 00:24:13.435
What do you want to do
with the couple?

452
00:24:14.703 --> 00:24:17.306
They made us waste
the past 25 years.

453
00:24:19.741 --> 00:24:21.143
What do you think?

454
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:23.946
I was thinking about
paying them.

455
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.081
Paying them?

456
00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:28.283
I bet you were thinking
about the same thing.

457
00:24:30.452 --> 00:24:33.455
Is this what you wanted
to talk about over lunch?

458
00:24:33.822 --> 00:24:35.023
At first,

459
00:24:35.023 --> 00:24:38.460
I wanted to meet him
and teach him a lesson.

460
00:24:39.194 --> 00:24:41.463
But I guess we should
cover it up for Eun Seok.

461
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:43.866
Are you saying
you'll forgive him?

462
00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:45.701
Pay them handsomely.

463
00:24:46.435 --> 00:24:48.504
So Eun Seok will feel
unencumbered.

464
00:24:51.373 --> 00:24:54.376
I appreciate your struggle
to find her by yourself.

465
00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:57.713
I still can't
believe this.

466
00:24:58.881 --> 00:25:00.849
I feel so bad...

467
00:25:02.351 --> 00:25:04.119
that I tried to think
she was dead.

468
00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:08.524
I'm sorry for you
and Eun Seok.

469
00:25:10.526 --> 00:25:13.495
It must've been hard
for you too...

470
00:25:13.629 --> 00:25:14.997
to think that way...

471
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:17.199
for the past 25 years.

472
00:25:17.966 --> 00:25:20.135
You've never given up
hope the whole time.

473
00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:23.438
Thank you.

474
00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:25.541
I owe it all to you.

475
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:33.649
But I lost her
in the first place.

476
00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:36.552
It's not that
you lost her on purpose.

477
00:25:36.852 --> 00:25:38.720
If it weren't for you, we
wouldn't have found her.

478
00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:51.800
They never told me...

479
00:25:52.534 --> 00:25:54.202
how they found out
about us.

480
00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:57.940
They hired a door-to-door
cosmetic saleswoman.

481
00:25:58.774 --> 00:25:59.975
Do you remember that day?

482
00:26:00.242 --> 00:26:02.244
When Ji An and Ji Soo's
toothbrushes were gone.

483
00:26:02.244 --> 00:26:05.280
They did DNA tests
with the toothbrushes.

484
00:26:05.347 --> 00:26:08.216
But you told them
Ji An's their daughter.

485
00:26:08.884 --> 00:26:11.353
Why on earth did you
do that?

486
00:26:11.353 --> 00:26:13.655
I don't know.
It just slipped out.

487
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.024
Which is it?

488
00:26:17.092 --> 00:26:20.629
Don't torment me
any longer, Mi Jung.

489
00:26:20.629 --> 00:26:22.731
Which girl is mine?

490
00:26:22.898 --> 00:26:25.968
Which is it?
Which one is mine?

491
00:26:25.968 --> 00:26:27.402
Who is my daughter?

492
00:26:27.703 --> 00:26:30.405
It's Ji An!

493
00:26:34.443 --> 00:26:35.744
She kept asking me...

494
00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:38.680
which one is her daughter.

495
00:26:39.581 --> 00:26:42.117
She kept pushing me
into a corner.

496
00:26:43.251 --> 00:26:45.287
Then I remembered
Ji An's back.

497
00:26:46.254 --> 00:26:48.690
And her name
came out of my mouth.

498
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:52.194
What are you talking
about? That's ridiculous.

499
00:26:56.331 --> 00:26:58.233
When I saw Ji An...

500
00:26:59.001 --> 00:27:00.302
at the police station...

501
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:02.037
(Mom)

502
00:27:02.771 --> 00:27:04.272
It's your mother.

503
00:27:06.108 --> 00:27:07.542
(Mom)

504
00:27:14.916 --> 00:27:16.551
Ji An is at
the police station...

505
00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:18.053
for assault.

506
00:27:18.253 --> 00:27:19.821
Come to the police station
for settlement.

507
00:27:20.989 --> 00:27:21.990
Assault?

508
00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:27.963
Here's the change, ma'am.

509
00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:31.667
Ma'am?

510
00:27:32.501 --> 00:27:35.704
This is how
the world works.

511
00:27:37.639 --> 00:27:38.807
Let's go.

512
00:28:13.742 --> 00:28:15.043
Dad...

513
00:28:34.296 --> 00:28:37.499
Her friend stole her job
using her connections,

514
00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:40.502
and she didn't tell Ji An
to get her riled up.

515
00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:56.051
When I saw Ji An's back
that day,

516
00:28:58.386 --> 00:28:59.855
I wanted to kill myself.

517
00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:05.360
Ji An was living her life
like that.

518
00:29:06.962 --> 00:29:09.464
She's struggled to earn
her school expenses.

519
00:29:10.432 --> 00:29:13.869
She's worked as an intern
and a contract worker.

520
00:29:15.303 --> 00:29:18.306
I just thought that's what
happens to kids nowadays.

521
00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:21.409
I knew things would be
tough for her,

522
00:29:21.643 --> 00:29:24.880
but I didn't know she'd
live in misery like that.

523
00:29:32.854 --> 00:29:34.623
So I said her name.

524
00:29:37.726 --> 00:29:39.194
I said her name, but...

525
00:29:40.962 --> 00:29:43.965
This is just crazy, right?

526
00:29:45.901 --> 00:29:48.503
I took someone else's kid
and raised her.

527
00:29:48.503 --> 00:29:49.704
And now...

528
00:29:50.005 --> 00:29:53.241
I told them their daughter
is Ji An, not Ji Soo.

529
00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:57.145
- So...
- But...

530
00:29:57.612 --> 00:30:00.148
I didn't want to confess
the truth.

531
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.719
I didn't want to admit
that I made a mistake.

532
00:30:06.454 --> 00:30:09.724
I didn't want to tell them
Ji Soo is their daughter.

533
00:30:12.594 --> 00:30:13.662
How could you...

534
00:30:14.963 --> 00:30:16.731
- Mi Jung.
- You know...

535
00:30:17.933 --> 00:30:19.467
that we raised Ji Soo
like our own daughter.

536
00:30:19.467 --> 00:30:20.669
Let's pretend...

537
00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:23.271
that we swapped our
daughter with theirs.

538
00:30:23.271 --> 00:30:24.739
Have you lost your mind?

539
00:30:25.307 --> 00:30:27.175
No, I cannot allow this.

540
00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:29.411
Tell them the truth
and apologize right away!

541
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:30.445
It's already too late.

542
00:30:30.445 --> 00:30:31.780
What are you
talking about?

543
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.782
Ji An has decided
to go live with them!

544
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.552
You must know what that
means. Don't you know her?

545
00:30:38.286 --> 00:30:40.055
It means she can't take it
anymore.

546
00:30:40.055 --> 00:30:41.890
She has no energy left
to hold out.

547
00:30:42.657 --> 00:30:45.694
Pretend to know nothing,
and just let her go.

548
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.131
Get up. We have to go
to Seoul right now.

549
00:30:51.466 --> 00:30:54.402
Taxi! Taxi!

550
00:30:57.372 --> 00:30:59.741
Ji An said
she wants to go!

551
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.879
She said she wants to go
live with them.

552
00:31:04.613 --> 00:31:07.215
She said it because she
doesn't know the truth,

553
00:31:07.282 --> 00:31:09.618
thinking that she's
really their daughter.

554
00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:11.152
She was fooled
by your lies!

555
00:31:11.887 --> 00:31:13.555
So, what are you going
to do in Seoul?

556
00:31:13.555 --> 00:31:15.690
I must tell Ji An first,
then tell that family...

557
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:16.791
that she's not
their daughter.

558
00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:18.159
Tae Soo,
let me tell you something.

559
00:31:19.294 --> 00:31:21.196
If you do that, you'll
lose both daughters.

560
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.832
I'll lose both of them?
What do you mean?

561
00:31:23.832 --> 00:31:26.501
Ji An has already decided
to live as their daughter.

562
00:31:26.668 --> 00:31:28.270
Do you think Ji Soo will
forgive us?

563
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.272
She'll know that we're
sending Ji An...

564
00:31:30.272 --> 00:31:32.474
to that rich family
instead of her.

565
00:31:33.942 --> 00:31:35.944
Ji Soo knows about this?

566
00:31:36.011 --> 00:31:37.946
Ji Tae and Ji Ho know too.

567
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.948
Ji An announced
in front of everyone...

568
00:31:39.948 --> 00:31:42.550
that she has decided to
live with that family.

569
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:44.686
How could you do this?

570
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.056
You didn't even discuss
with me about this.

571
00:31:48.056 --> 00:31:49.424
What have you done?

572
00:31:49.424 --> 00:31:51.092
How could you...

573
00:31:51.092 --> 00:31:52.460
Had I told you,

574
00:31:53.695 --> 00:31:55.463
you wouldn't have let me
do it.

575
00:31:56.965 --> 00:31:58.967
Why are you so foolish?

576
00:31:59.668 --> 00:32:02.637
You'll send Ji An instead
of Ji Soo, then what?

577
00:32:02.637 --> 00:32:04.272
There's no such thing
as a secret.

578
00:32:04.272 --> 00:32:05.540
As soon as
she moves in,

579
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:07.943
she can go study abroad.

580
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.145
What?

581
00:32:10.145 --> 00:32:12.213
I'll tell her to go study
abroad as soon as she can.

582
00:32:12.213 --> 00:32:14.015
You know that she has
always dreamt of...

583
00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:17.052
studying sculpture
since elementary school.

584
00:32:17.052 --> 00:32:20.422
She liked making things
way more than Ji Tae did.

585
00:32:20.422 --> 00:32:21.623
Did you fool everyone...

586
00:32:21.756 --> 00:32:23.191
just so she can
study abroad?

587
00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:25.460
"Just so that she can
study abroad?"

588
00:32:26.695 --> 00:32:28.863
Tae Soo, you make it
sound so easy.

589
00:32:28.863 --> 00:32:31.766
It's not just studying.
She'll get her dream back.

590
00:32:31.766 --> 00:32:34.135
Who made her give up? Why
did she have to give up?

591
00:32:34.135 --> 00:32:36.104
She had to take a leave of
absence to make money...

592
00:32:36.104 --> 00:32:37.105
for her tuition fees
and so on.

593
00:32:37.105 --> 00:32:38.940
Unlike her friends, she
never got to go abroad...

594
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.275
or build her resume.

595
00:32:40.275 --> 00:32:43.378
Who made her
live like that?

596
00:32:50.418 --> 00:32:52.821
They might find out
down the road,

597
00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:54.689
but she'll still be able
to study abroad.

598
00:32:54.689 --> 00:32:56.424
That can't be
taken away.

599
00:32:56.424 --> 00:32:57.525
What will happen
if they find out?

600
00:32:58.526 --> 00:32:59.627
What about Ji An?

601
00:33:00.428 --> 00:33:01.696
How do you think
she'll feel?

602
00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.732
What is she going to do?

603
00:33:03.732 --> 00:33:06.134
She didn't fool them.
It was all me.

604
00:33:06.134 --> 00:33:08.370
She was also fooled by me.

605
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:10.405
She'll be shocked
and blame me.

606
00:33:11.673 --> 00:33:13.108
I don't care about that.

607
00:33:14.242 --> 00:33:15.377
Then what about Ji Soo?

608
00:33:16.311 --> 00:33:17.979
Don't you feel guilty
when you think about her?

609
00:33:22.617 --> 00:33:23.785
Ji Soo is...

610
00:33:27.622 --> 00:33:29.624
She's happy enough here.

611
00:33:31.659 --> 00:33:32.861
Ji An...

612
00:33:33.661 --> 00:33:35.430
is unhappy with us.

613
00:33:45.206 --> 00:33:46.741
I didn't know you'd be
here in person, sir.

614
00:33:46.741 --> 00:33:48.777
I wanted to
pick it up myself.

615
00:33:49.177 --> 00:33:50.178
Is it ready?

616
00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:00.255
To whom are you
gifting it to?

617
00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:03.124
It's limited-edition, and
you even got it engraved.

618
00:34:03.992 --> 00:34:06.061
It belongs to this person.

619
00:34:06.961 --> 00:34:08.630
Although it's
eight years too late.

620
00:34:28.883 --> 00:34:29.951
I'll tell the kids...

621
00:34:32.287 --> 00:34:34.823
that you can't come to
Seoul for a little while.

622
00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:39.260
I'll tell Ji An
to see you later on,

623
00:34:40.228 --> 00:34:41.863
so just pretend
you know nothing,

624
00:34:42.864 --> 00:34:44.265
and stay here.

625
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.868
Are you...

626
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:50.371
the Yang Mi Jung I know?

627
00:34:51.406 --> 00:34:53.975
The woman whom I've been
living with for 35 years.

628
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:56.511
Are you really her?

629
00:35:03.618 --> 00:35:04.619
I should go.

630
00:36:00.642 --> 00:36:01.609
Hey, Myung Shin.

631
00:36:02.844 --> 00:36:03.978
Are you busy?

632
00:36:04.012 --> 00:36:05.180
No.

633
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.216
I was just wondering
what I should do today.

634
00:36:08.283 --> 00:36:10.451
What? You were wondering
what you should do?

635
00:36:10.618 --> 00:36:12.820
"Working my shift." "On
the road after my shift."

636
00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.522
I was expecting to hear
something like that.

637
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:17.592
Oh, the tteokbokki place
we used to love is gone.

638
00:36:18.426 --> 00:36:19.928
Are you in Hongdae now?

639
00:36:20.495 --> 00:36:22.230
Are you there
for an interview?

640
00:36:22.363 --> 00:36:24.499
No, I'm just
walking around.

641
00:36:26.634 --> 00:36:28.369
I didn't hear from you,

642
00:36:28.903 --> 00:36:30.905
so I waited and decided
I should call you.

643
00:36:31.206 --> 00:36:33.074
I heard you didn't get
the job at Haesung.

644
00:36:33.074 --> 00:36:34.075
That's right.

645
00:36:34.576 --> 00:36:35.977
What has gotten into you?

646
00:36:35.977 --> 00:36:38.179
You're acting like a girl
from a rich family...

647
00:36:38.179 --> 00:36:39.781
with no worries.

648
00:36:39.781 --> 00:36:40.782
Myung Shin.

649
00:36:41.549 --> 00:36:43.718
The sky in September
is really beautiful.

650
00:36:43.718 --> 00:36:45.119
The clouds are pretty too.

651
00:36:45.553 --> 00:36:48.089
Who knew the sky in Seoul
still looked like this?

652
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:50.725
Ji An, are you okay?

653
00:36:51.593 --> 00:36:53.061
Oh, I hear the bell.

654
00:36:53.061 --> 00:36:54.362
Go to your class.
Let's talk later.

655
00:36:54.362 --> 00:36:55.363
Wait.

656
00:36:55.363 --> 00:36:57.599
Yoon Hee's wedding is
tomorrow. You know, right?

657
00:36:58.299 --> 00:37:01.035
Gosh, I forgot.
Is it tomorrow?

658
00:37:01.269 --> 00:37:02.270
Are you coming?

659
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.906
Of course. I must
be there for Yoon Hee.

660
00:37:04.906 --> 00:37:05.974
I'll meet you
in front of the venue.

661
00:37:05.974 --> 00:37:07.342
Go to your class.

662
00:37:08.977 --> 00:37:10.511
I almost forgot.

663
00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:14.015
Yoon Ha Jung.

664
00:37:25.226 --> 00:37:28.463
(We loan money to
housewives...)

665
00:37:31.633 --> 00:37:32.700
(Agreement to Give Up
My Body and Organs)

666
00:37:36.804 --> 00:37:39.741
No, no. She said
it's not a private loan.

667
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:50.551
She won't even pass
the interview.

668
00:37:55.056 --> 00:37:58.860
You're only taking
my kidney, right?

669
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.199
Her heart, kidney, liver,
lungs, and eyeballs.

670
00:38:17.111 --> 00:38:20.114
Mr. Choi, the meeting
is about to start.

671
00:38:20.114 --> 00:38:21.215
What meeting?

672
00:38:21.949 --> 00:38:24.352
In the morning,
you asked me...

673
00:38:24.352 --> 00:38:26.554
to call a meeting for the
strategic planning team.

674
00:38:27.021 --> 00:38:28.890
Oh, yes. I remember.

675
00:38:31.092 --> 00:38:33.161
By the way, what is that?

676
00:38:33.161 --> 00:38:34.662
- This?
- Yes.

677
00:38:35.863 --> 00:38:38.299
Mr. Yoo, let's say you
need 20,000 dollars today.

678
00:38:38.299 --> 00:38:41.202
If not, you'll get fired.
What will you do then?

679
00:38:41.202 --> 00:38:42.570
Then I'll just ask you...

680
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.305
Me?
I won't lend you a penny.

681
00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:46.574
Then I'll use
my rent deposit.

682
00:38:46.574 --> 00:38:48.409
You live at your friend's
place. There's no deposit.

683
00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:50.078
Then I'll sell my watch
and other things...

684
00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:51.079
They're all knock-offs.

685
00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:52.447
Then I'll get my severance
pay in advance...

686
00:38:52.447 --> 00:38:53.748
There's no severance pay.

687
00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:55.249
- I'll ask my parents...
- Your parents?

688
00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:57.952
Yes, my parents
will help me.

689
00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:03.825
Will your parents give you
that much in cash?

690
00:39:04.225 --> 00:39:07.095
By the way, is that
20,000 dollars?

691
00:39:07.095 --> 00:39:09.630
Well, what kind of parents
give 20,000 dollars...

692
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:12.633
in 50-dollar bills?

693
00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:15.136
Gosh, no one
would do that.

694
00:39:15.203 --> 00:39:17.572
Unless they're loan
sharks, that is.

695
00:39:17.572 --> 00:39:20.074
Right? No parents
would do such a thing.

696
00:39:20.541 --> 00:39:22.910
Then how on earth
did she get this money?

697
00:39:23.678 --> 00:39:25.446
1, from a loan shark.
2, from working at a bar.

698
00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:26.714
Three, from selling
organs.

699
00:39:26.714 --> 00:39:29.016
If it's a girl, the bar.
If it's a guy, the organs.

700
00:39:31.285 --> 00:39:34.222
But these days,
even bars...

701
00:39:36.157 --> 00:39:38.092
don't pay that much unless
the girl is super hot.

702
00:39:38.226 --> 00:39:39.660
I guess 10,000 dollars
per person is possible.

703
00:39:40.428 --> 00:39:41.496
10,000 per person?

704
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:43.364
10,000 per person...

705
00:39:43.731 --> 00:39:44.766
Two girls?

706
00:39:57.111 --> 00:40:00.014
I have a seriously
bad feeling about this.

707
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.653
I like this the most.
Is the furniture ready?

708
00:40:05.653 --> 00:40:08.156
Yes. They'll be delivered
by the time...

709
00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:09.657
the floor's done.

710
00:40:10.191 --> 00:40:12.560
Then we're left with
the curtains and bedding.

711
00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.996
- We chose the bedding.
- Yes.

712
00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:17.098
Mom.

713
00:40:17.532 --> 00:40:19.000
When did you come home?

714
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.670
I just dropped by to check
the furniture and layout.

715
00:40:23.304 --> 00:40:25.540
I'm leaving for
my afternoon class.

716
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.110
How about flowy curtains
in white or ivory?

717
00:40:29.477 --> 00:40:31.779
Mom, I'm off to class.

718
00:40:31.779 --> 00:40:32.880
Okay.

719
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.049
I have to leave soon.
Let's speed things up.

720
00:40:35.049 --> 00:40:36.884
- Okay.
- That's nice.

721
00:40:48.129 --> 00:40:50.364
- Oh no. Are you okay?
- What's wrong?

722
00:40:50.465 --> 00:40:51.799
- Are you okay?
- Get up.

723
00:40:51.799 --> 00:40:53.634
Are you all right?

724
00:40:53.901 --> 00:40:55.369
Are you sick?

725
00:40:55.369 --> 00:40:58.806
You haven't been yourself
since you had lunch.

726
00:40:58.806 --> 00:41:01.509
I'm fine. I'll be okay.

727
00:41:01.843 --> 00:41:04.512
What's going on?
Watch yourself.

728
00:41:08.449 --> 00:41:12.420
Please tell Eun Seok that
we have everything ready.

729
00:41:14.288 --> 00:41:15.656
I will.

730
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:17.825
I'll say that...

731
00:41:18.259 --> 00:41:21.596
you and your husband made
a mistake 25 years ago.

732
00:41:22.363 --> 00:41:25.366
I'll let it go. It's what
my husband wants.

733
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.639
When can we pick her up?

734
00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:36.410
I think... Soon,
within a few days.

735
00:41:37.478 --> 00:41:41.382
Ji An will need time
to sort things out.

736
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.619
I had something
to say to you,

737
00:41:44.619 --> 00:41:48.322
but you said you wanted to
speak with me. Go ahead.

738
00:41:49.724 --> 00:41:50.791
Well...

739
00:41:52.159 --> 00:41:53.361
I'd like you to...

740
00:41:54.595 --> 00:41:57.765
let Ji An
go abroad to study.

741
00:41:59.133 --> 00:42:00.401
Abroad?

742
00:42:00.635 --> 00:42:03.471
She wanted to
be a sculptor.

743
00:42:03.871 --> 00:42:07.575
She had that dream since
she was in middle school.

744
00:42:07.942 --> 00:42:10.745
We meant to send her
to study art in Chicago,

745
00:42:11.245 --> 00:42:13.481
but then my husband's
business failed.

746
00:42:13.481 --> 00:42:15.349
She had to give up art...

747
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:17.051
We'll deal with that.

748
00:42:17.351 --> 00:42:20.788
Ji An was very good.
She's very talented.

749
00:42:20.788 --> 00:42:22.089
That's enough.

750
00:42:22.823 --> 00:42:23.824
What?

751
00:42:23.824 --> 00:42:25.726
You raised her
all these years,

752
00:42:25.726 --> 00:42:28.629
so it'll take some time
to cut ties.

753
00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:30.598
Still, it must be done.

754
00:42:31.899 --> 00:42:34.802
- What do you mean?
- To join our family,

755
00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:36.804
don't you think
she'll need time?

756
00:42:39.473 --> 00:42:43.010
You won't see her until
she makes the transition.

757
00:42:50.885 --> 00:42:52.153
Open it.

758
00:42:55.423 --> 00:42:57.191
What's this?

759
00:42:57.191 --> 00:42:59.460
We meant to open
the store ourselves,

760
00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:01.262
so it's in a good spot.

761
00:43:01.596 --> 00:43:03.864
If you fill in and
submit the form,

762
00:43:04.265 --> 00:43:06.133
our staff
will contact you.

763
00:43:07.602 --> 00:43:10.037
Why are you
giving this to me?

764
00:43:11.038 --> 00:43:12.540
What is this for?

765
00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.575
We don't need it.

766
00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:18.379
I looked you up
before visiting you.

767
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.781
Your husband
struggled for a while...

768
00:43:21.115 --> 00:43:22.950
after his business failed.

769
00:43:25.419 --> 00:43:27.021
We get by.

770
00:43:27.822 --> 00:43:31.092
Not knowing when
you'll starve isn't ideal.

771
00:43:32.326 --> 00:43:35.429
It's none of your concern.

772
00:43:35.429 --> 00:43:38.032
Your husband is
a day laborer.

773
00:43:38.265 --> 00:43:40.801
Shouldn't he have
a stable job?

774
00:43:41.135 --> 00:43:42.303
What?

775
00:43:42.403 --> 00:43:45.806
Ji An will be concerned
about you for a while.

776
00:43:45.973 --> 00:43:48.476
How would she feel
knowing her father is...

777
00:43:48.476 --> 00:43:50.411
a construction worker?

778
00:43:51.779 --> 00:43:53.981
No, you're wrong.

779
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:56.951
My husband works at...

780
00:43:57.451 --> 00:43:59.053
a distribution center.

781
00:43:59.286 --> 00:44:00.655
He's a manager there.

782
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:06.160
Is that what
your husband told you?

783
00:44:13.367 --> 00:44:17.038
Consider this compensation
for the costs of...

784
00:44:17.805 --> 00:44:19.540
raising Eun Seok.

785
00:44:29.116 --> 00:44:31.152
- Thank you.
- Bye.

786
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:39.927
Ji Soo.

787
00:44:41.328 --> 00:44:42.329
Yes?

788
00:44:42.363 --> 00:44:43.764
Did your parents
pass away?

789
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:45.700
No.

790
00:44:45.966 --> 00:44:48.803
Did the man
on the bike reject you?

791
00:44:49.403 --> 00:44:50.671
No.

792
00:44:51.038 --> 00:44:53.441
You have an eye infection.
See a doctor.

793
00:44:54.408 --> 00:44:56.110
I don't need to.

794
00:44:56.744 --> 00:44:58.679
It's not an infection.

795
00:44:59.447 --> 00:45:01.949
You only stop crying
when there's a customer.

796
00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:04.518
See a psychiatrist.
I hate it when people cry.

797
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.054
Okay.

798
00:45:08.422 --> 00:45:09.790
Welcome.

799
00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:12.493
- Do your legs hurt?
- Yes.

800
00:45:12.993 --> 00:45:14.261
Just a moment.

801
00:45:15.629 --> 00:45:17.832
Sit on this. Hang on.

802
00:45:18.866 --> 00:45:20.634
We don't have chairs.

803
00:45:21.602 --> 00:45:23.404
Thanks, miss.

804
00:45:23.404 --> 00:45:25.940
What's going on?

805
00:45:26.841 --> 00:45:29.610
She didn't have
the money last night,

806
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.746
but she brought me cash
this morning.

807
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:33.013
Cash?

808
00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.516
A plastic bag
full of 50-dollar bills.

809
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.718
They weren't from a bank.

810
00:45:37.718 --> 00:45:40.154
They weren't in
bundles or piles.

811
00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:42.923
She got the money
to save her pride?

812
00:45:44.091 --> 00:45:46.360
- She's interesting.
- Interesting?

813
00:45:47.328 --> 00:45:49.697
I've never had
this bad a feeling.

814
00:45:49.697 --> 00:45:50.765
Why is it bad?

815
00:45:50.765 --> 00:45:53.134
Pride can't beat money.

816
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.970
I mocked her a bit.
It could've hurt.

817
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.805
A girl who didn't have
5,000 dollars...

818
00:45:57.972 --> 00:45:59.740
got 20,000 from
somewhere overnight?

819
00:45:59.974 --> 00:46:01.408
Just for pride?

820
00:46:01.542 --> 00:46:03.611
- Revenge.
- Revenge?

821
00:46:03.711 --> 00:46:06.113
Do Kyung, return
the money right away.

822
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.549
Someone must've
snapped you taking it.

823
00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:09.717
Photographs?

824
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:12.219
I thought about that...

825
00:46:12.219 --> 00:46:14.722
and looked around.
There was nothing.

826
00:46:14.722 --> 00:46:17.391
If you didn't see him,
maybe he's an expert.

827
00:46:18.559 --> 00:46:20.094
What can you do
with photos?

828
00:46:20.761 --> 00:46:23.230
Say you demanded something
after the accident.

829
00:46:23.531 --> 00:46:25.633
Haesung Corporation's heir
Choi Do Kyung.

830
00:46:26.634 --> 00:46:29.470
She'll want 10 times
the money, post it online,

831
00:46:30.304 --> 00:46:31.672
or tell a reporter.

832
00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:41.882
Your noblesse oblige
was always so risky.

833
00:46:42.716 --> 00:46:44.552
Why are you
so considerate?

834
00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.389
Come here. Let's talk.

835
00:46:54.762 --> 00:46:55.863
Ji Soo.

836
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.266
Nothing will change
after I leave.

837
00:47:01.001 --> 00:47:03.904
You're my sister,
we'll have our parents,

838
00:47:03.904 --> 00:47:05.472
Ji Tae is Ji Tae,

839
00:47:05.472 --> 00:47:06.674
and Ji Ho is Ji Ho.

840
00:47:06.674 --> 00:47:08.175
It'll be just the same.

841
00:47:08.509 --> 00:47:10.244
Don't be so serious.

842
00:47:10.511 --> 00:47:13.781
How is it the same?
I won't see you every day.

843
00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:15.883
We won't live together.

844
00:47:15.883 --> 00:47:18.786
Neither will we
when we get married.

845
00:47:18.786 --> 00:47:20.788
That's marriage.

846
00:47:20.955 --> 00:47:22.723
This isn't
the same as that.

847
00:47:24.391 --> 00:47:26.060
Must you really go?

848
00:47:26.827 --> 00:47:28.095
Why?

849
00:47:29.029 --> 00:47:30.431
Is it for the money?

850
00:47:31.031 --> 00:47:35.202
You can stay with us
and ask them for a job.

851
00:47:37.805 --> 00:47:40.174
Why do you have to go?

852
00:47:40.474 --> 00:47:42.009
Can't you stay?

853
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:45.679
Think about it
from their perspective.

854
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.382
Those parents
didn't bring you up.

855
00:47:49.149 --> 00:47:51.452
We spent
every day together.

856
00:47:52.219 --> 00:47:53.721
I don't believe this.

857
00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:55.723
I can't believe it.

858
00:47:58.392 --> 00:47:59.727
Ji Soo.

859
00:48:09.136 --> 00:48:10.304
Hello?

860
00:48:10.304 --> 00:48:11.906
It's the victim.

861
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.342
Hello? Hello?

862
00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:17.011
See?

863
00:48:17.011 --> 00:48:18.612
She hung up.

864
00:48:18.612 --> 00:48:20.014
Her plan's in motion.

865
00:48:20.347 --> 00:48:21.682
Her plan?

866
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:31.992
(Block number)

867
00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:33.694
The call can't be taken.

868
00:48:33.694 --> 00:48:34.762
She can't pick up.

869
00:48:34.762 --> 00:48:36.630
- She blocked you.
- What?

870
00:48:37.531 --> 00:48:39.400
It's not blackmail then.

871
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.768
How do you know?

872
00:48:40.868 --> 00:48:42.770
If she took photos then...

873
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.972
and wanted to
use them against me,

874
00:48:44.972 --> 00:48:46.140
she wouldn't block me.

875
00:48:46.307 --> 00:48:48.842
Even if she uploaded them
or called a reporter,

876
00:48:48.842 --> 00:48:51.111
she'd still
want to taunt me.

877
00:48:51.412 --> 00:48:52.846
Then what is it?

878
00:48:54.014 --> 00:48:56.250
There's only
one other option.

879
00:49:37.925 --> 00:49:39.159
Honey.

880
00:49:39.493 --> 00:49:42.096
Can you attach
a door right over there?

881
00:49:42.096 --> 00:49:43.630
Sweetie.

882
00:49:43.864 --> 00:49:45.399
Don't start getting ideas.

883
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.770
Too bad I'm getting
even worse ideas now.

884
00:49:50.304 --> 00:49:51.305
Hey.

885
00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.476
Let's get a rooftop room.

886
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:02.549
With the money we spend
to come here.

887
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:05.652
Hey. A rooftop room
or semi-basement.

888
00:50:05.652 --> 00:50:07.421
Didn't you move into...

889
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:08.922
a women-only condo
to feel safe?

890
00:50:08.922 --> 00:50:10.791
Who said
I want to live there?

891
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:13.093
I meant to use it
as our hideout.

892
00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:14.361
A hideout?

893
00:50:14.862 --> 00:50:17.531
Do you want to get married
in a rooftop room?

894
00:50:17.531 --> 00:50:20.634
Don't say
things like that.

895
00:50:21.135 --> 00:50:22.536
Then give up.

896
00:50:22.536 --> 00:50:24.538
This is a perfect hideout.

897
00:50:24.538 --> 00:50:25.939
Reasonably spacious...

898
00:50:25.939 --> 00:50:26.974
and thrilling.

899
00:50:31.812 --> 00:50:32.780
How could you?

900
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.615
We need a reason
to keep dating.

901
00:50:44.892 --> 00:50:46.727
Go home. I'll get inside.

902
00:50:52.466 --> 00:50:53.967
Not here.

903
00:50:53.967 --> 00:50:55.369
We got caught last time.

904
00:50:55.369 --> 00:50:56.570
No, no.

905
00:50:59.073 --> 00:51:00.841
Hey. That hurt.

906
00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:05.412
I'm sorry, Mi Sook.

907
00:51:05.946 --> 00:51:07.014
For what?

908
00:51:08.482 --> 00:51:11.452
I'm sorry
for being Seo Ji Tae.

909
00:51:11.785 --> 00:51:13.153
What do you mean?

910
00:51:13.287 --> 00:51:15.923
Would you feel better
if you were Park Ji Tae?

911
00:51:22.996 --> 00:51:23.997
Go home.

912
00:51:25.899 --> 00:51:27.301
If you're sorry,

913
00:51:28.469 --> 00:51:30.537
go to the wedding
with me tomorrow.

914
00:51:32.239 --> 00:51:34.541
We agreed not to
attend events together.

915
00:51:34.541 --> 00:51:36.443
But he was my first love.

916
00:51:36.443 --> 00:51:38.879
I confessed my love,
and he turned me down.

917
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.281
I don't want to go alone.

918
00:51:41.782 --> 00:51:42.883
I'll look shabby.

919
00:51:45.252 --> 00:51:46.720
Okay, then.

920
00:51:47.221 --> 00:51:49.490
I can't let you
look shabby.

921
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:50.591
Really?

922
00:51:57.731 --> 00:52:00.901
We raised Ji Soo
like our own daughter.

923
00:52:00.901 --> 00:52:02.136
Let's pretend...

924
00:52:02.136 --> 00:52:04.037
that we swapped our
daughter with theirs.

925
00:52:04.037 --> 00:52:05.639
Do you think Ji Soo will
forgive us?

926
00:52:05.639 --> 00:52:07.574
She'll know that we're
sending Ji An...

927
00:52:07.574 --> 00:52:09.743
to that rich family
instead of her.

928
00:52:09.743 --> 00:52:12.613
As soon as she moves in,
she can go study abroad.

929
00:52:12.613 --> 00:52:15.616
It's not just studying.
She'll get her dream back.

930
00:52:15.616 --> 00:52:17.784
Who made her give up? Why
did she have to give up?

931
00:52:17.784 --> 00:52:21.054
She's happy enough here.

932
00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:24.224
Ji An is unhappy with us.

933
00:53:21.448 --> 00:53:24.751
(Franchise Contract)

934
00:53:34.361 --> 00:53:35.596
Hae Ja, is that you?

935
00:53:41.034 --> 00:53:42.102
Why...

936
00:53:43.403 --> 00:53:44.671
Why are you here?

937
00:53:44.671 --> 00:53:45.739
Where's Ji An?

938
00:53:45.739 --> 00:53:47.407
What are you doing here?

939
00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:49.943
- Ji An.
- She isn't in.

940
00:53:50.844 --> 00:53:53.180
She left to return
something to her friend.

941
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.950
She has a wedding at 3pm
and will be home late.

942
00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.388
Sit.

943
00:54:10.631 --> 00:54:11.732
Okay.

944
00:54:12.633 --> 00:54:15.769
My business failed when
Ji An started high school.

945
00:54:15.769 --> 00:54:17.537
She had to
give up her dream.

946
00:54:17.537 --> 00:54:19.840
She had to work
all through college.

947
00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.809
That's why she couldn't
maintain good grades...

948
00:54:22.809 --> 00:54:24.611
and struggled
to find a job.

949
00:54:25.679 --> 00:54:29.149
Yes, everything you said
was right. It's all on me.

950
00:54:31.885 --> 00:54:33.920
I didn't mean to
blame you.

951
00:54:34.821 --> 00:54:38.692
I thought about
what you said all night.

952
00:54:39.092 --> 00:54:42.195
I thought again and again.

953
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:44.531
But still...

954
00:54:45.866 --> 00:54:48.035
This...
This is still wrong.

955
00:54:48.302 --> 00:54:49.303
Please.

956
00:54:49.303 --> 00:54:52.172
It's not too late.
We must correct this.

957
00:54:52.673 --> 00:54:55.042
Are you the only one
who can think?

958
00:54:55.575 --> 00:54:57.811
Do you think
I don't know it's wrong?

959
00:54:57.844 --> 00:54:59.780
That I don't
feel sorry for Ji Soo?

960
00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:01.281
That I didn't
think of her?

961
00:55:01.281 --> 00:55:02.883
Whatever you say,

962
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:05.919
I won't let Ji An
move into that house.

963
00:55:05.919 --> 00:55:07.120
I won't.

964
00:55:07.954 --> 00:55:09.423
If you ruin things now,

965
00:55:09.423 --> 00:55:11.325
you might
as well kill her.

966
00:55:12.092 --> 00:55:15.362
She'll never recover
from the guilt and shame.

967
00:55:16.029 --> 00:55:18.432
She wanted to go when she
found out they were rich.

968
00:55:18.432 --> 00:55:21.034
But what if it turns out
that she isn't their kid?

969
00:55:21.034 --> 00:55:22.469
Me, me!

970
00:55:23.203 --> 00:55:24.404
I'm Ji An's father.

971
00:55:26.239 --> 00:55:29.176
I'll see to it that
she doesn't get hurt,

972
00:55:29.176 --> 00:55:30.410
so don't ever stop me.

973
00:55:32.679 --> 00:55:33.780
What will you do?

974
00:55:35.115 --> 00:55:36.850
What will you tell her?

975
00:55:37.784 --> 00:55:41.555
Ji An would never go
just to become rich.

976
00:55:42.489 --> 00:55:43.790
You said you scared her.

977
00:55:44.991 --> 00:55:47.160
You said those people
would make us pay...

978
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.995
for not telling the police
that we found her.

979
00:55:49.629 --> 00:55:51.465
That's why
she said she'd go.

980
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:59.239
Can we have
two vanilla lattes?

981
00:55:59.473 --> 00:56:01.241
Okay... Sure.

982
00:56:04.344 --> 00:56:06.346
Vanilla latte is
her signature coffee now.

983
00:56:06.346 --> 00:56:08.382
This is a lovely place.

984
00:56:09.383 --> 00:56:12.018
Are these what
the students made?

985
00:56:12.018 --> 00:56:14.020
They're pretty good.

986
00:56:14.554 --> 00:56:16.189
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

987
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.602
Seriously.

988
00:56:28.602 --> 00:56:31.671
Find me a couple of chairs
for the store.

989
00:56:32.072 --> 00:56:33.140
Chairs?

990
00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.308
For the elderly customers.

991
00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:37.811
Oh. What kind?

992
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:39.880
I'll find a few online.

993
00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:43.850
No, no. Look for
a furniture store nearby.

994
00:56:44.284 --> 00:56:46.052
I haven't seen
a furniture...

995
00:56:46.887 --> 00:56:49.089
Oh, there is a place
that sells chairs.

996
00:56:49.089 --> 00:56:50.991
- A cafe with furniture...
- Good.

997
00:56:50.991 --> 00:56:53.593
Then here you go.
Go take a look.

998
00:56:53.593 --> 00:56:55.562
- Right now?
- Yes.

999
00:56:55.562 --> 00:56:57.030
Right now, I'm a bit...

1000
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:59.099
You're a bit what? What?

1001
00:56:59.132 --> 00:57:00.634
You won't eat
bread or rice.

1002
00:57:00.634 --> 00:57:02.669
I don't want to see you
mope all day.

1003
00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:04.271
Get going right now.

1004
00:57:05.071 --> 00:57:07.841
Okay. Then I'll head off.

1005
00:57:12.179 --> 00:57:13.213
Here.

1006
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.081
Is this for me?

1007
00:57:15.515 --> 00:57:16.950
A late opening present?

1008
00:57:18.752 --> 00:57:21.121
It's the jacket
you lent me in Yangpyeong.

1009
00:57:21.121 --> 00:57:23.423
I wasn't sure
what you'd need.

1010
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:25.158
Sorry I wasn't at
the opening.

1011
00:57:25.659 --> 00:57:27.360
It's fine,
I was just kidding.

1012
00:57:27.994 --> 00:57:30.630
I just wanted to
brag about the store.

1013
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:32.032
Where's your office?

1014
00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:34.201
Let's drink our coffees
and go have a look.

1015
00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:35.202
What's up?

1016
00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:37.704
Is this world ending?
Are you emigrating?

1017
00:57:37.904 --> 00:57:39.573
You bought me meat,
returned my clothes,

1018
00:57:39.573 --> 00:57:40.841
came here,
and now my office?

1019
00:57:40.841 --> 00:57:43.443
Because I'm curious
and fascinated.

1020
00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:46.346
Come by whenever
you want a break.

1021
00:57:46.346 --> 00:57:48.215
I'll make sure
you don't have to pay.

1022
00:57:49.249 --> 00:57:50.250
Hyuk.

1023
00:57:51.151 --> 00:57:52.919
Why are you so good to me?

1024
00:57:54.287 --> 00:57:55.722
Am I good to you?

1025
00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:58.492
For just one year in our
first year of high school.

1026
00:57:58.492 --> 00:58:01.094
We only met
during carpentry class.

1027
00:58:01.595 --> 00:58:04.197
You weren't
like this back then.

1028
00:58:05.265 --> 00:58:07.400
Why am I good to you?

1029
00:58:08.635 --> 00:58:09.669
There's a reason.

1030
00:58:10.303 --> 00:58:11.304
A reason?

1031
00:58:11.471 --> 00:58:14.441
You know I was transferred
to your school because...

1032
00:58:14.975 --> 00:58:16.910
I got into trouble as
the school year started?

1033
00:58:17.344 --> 00:58:19.613
You were the bully
in middle school.

1034
00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.481
Rumors had spread and...

1035
00:58:21.481 --> 00:58:24.217
kids tried to avoid you.
What about that?

1036
00:58:24.217 --> 00:58:27.020
My dad sent me to that
school saying I should...

1037
00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.422
learn a trade since
I couldn't go to college.

1038
00:58:29.422 --> 00:58:30.490
We even moved to do so.

1039
00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:33.093
Is that why you joined
the carpentry class?

1040
00:58:38.231 --> 00:58:39.533
(Carpentry)

1041
00:58:39.533 --> 00:58:41.968
If you don't graduate
from high school,

1042
00:58:41.968 --> 00:58:43.470
I'll guarantee...

1043
00:58:44.037 --> 00:58:46.806
that I'll be in the papers
for killing my own son.

1044
00:58:47.541 --> 00:58:49.509
At least learn the basics
of carpentry.

1045
00:58:51.711 --> 00:58:52.779
He's so cruel.

1046
00:59:05.091 --> 00:59:06.960
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1047
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.629
- You're really good.
- Not bad.

1048
00:59:42.596 --> 00:59:45.131
Who are you? A new kid?

1049
00:59:45.332 --> 00:59:46.466
Hi.

1050
00:59:48.702 --> 00:59:52.205
You sawed through that
like it was nothing.

1051
00:59:52.739 --> 00:59:54.941
I fell in love
with carpentry that day.

1052
00:59:55.809 --> 00:59:57.811
I'm good at sawing.

1053
00:59:57.911 --> 01:00:00.380
Right. I taught you
how to saw.

1054
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.881
And the carving knife.

1055
01:00:02.782 --> 01:00:05.285
So I'm the one
who led you to...

1056
01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:06.553
where you are now.

1057
01:00:06.886 --> 01:00:08.622
You were like a spring
back then.

1058
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:10.290
A spring?

1059
01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:12.759
I've never seen you
discouraged.

1060
01:00:13.326 --> 01:00:14.928
You were always excited...

1061
01:00:14.928 --> 01:00:17.864
and said yes to
all requests.

1062
01:00:18.098 --> 01:00:20.200
You were so nosy too.

1063
01:00:20.467 --> 01:00:22.135
If anyone got mugged,

1064
01:00:22.268 --> 01:00:23.903
you'd take me with you
and get the money back.

1065
01:00:23.903 --> 01:00:25.372
Did I?

1066
01:00:25.805 --> 01:00:27.073
I don't remember it.

1067
01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:31.211
You must've been surprised
to see how different I am.

1068
01:00:31.344 --> 01:00:32.779
It's not you.

1069
01:00:33.013 --> 01:00:35.281
The environment made
you look changed.

1070
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:38.518
Thank you for saying that.

1071
01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:40.787
Don't be like that.

1072
01:00:40.787 --> 01:00:42.288
We're friends.

1073
01:00:42.288 --> 01:00:43.490
I'm not sure.

1074
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.992
Do you think we can stay
as friends?

1075
01:00:46.693 --> 01:00:48.762
Friends need to share
similar thoughts,

1076
01:00:49.429 --> 01:00:51.631
but we're different.
I've changed.

1077
01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:53.633
What do you mean?

1078
01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:56.569
By the way, who's she?

1079
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:59.806
She's my business partner.

1080
01:00:59.806 --> 01:01:00.840
I see.

1081
01:01:02.976 --> 01:01:04.477
I forgot to
give you water.

1082
01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:07.213
Hello. I'm his friend.

1083
01:01:07.213 --> 01:01:08.982
We're friends from
high school.

1084
01:01:08.982 --> 01:01:10.884
I see.

1085
01:01:11.785 --> 01:01:12.819
Hyuk...

1086
01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.424
Please be nice to
Mr. Sun Woo.

1087
01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.364
Excuse me.

1088
01:01:28.134 --> 01:01:29.302
Dad.

1089
01:01:31.171 --> 01:01:32.739
Are you back in Seoul?

1090
01:01:34.474 --> 01:01:36.209
No. I can go now.

1091
01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:39.079
Okay. I'll get going now.

1092
01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.881
- I'm sorry, but...
- I'll call the cab.

1093
01:01:42.482 --> 01:01:44.651
I want to give you a ride,
but I have a meeting.

1094
01:01:44.884 --> 01:01:47.420
You don't need to.
Can you call a cab for me?

1095
01:01:52.058 --> 01:01:53.827
Does he have to
ask me to buy it now...

1096
01:01:53.827 --> 01:01:55.462
when I'm so exhausted?

1097
01:01:59.532 --> 01:02:01.201
That's Mr. Sun Woo.

1098
01:02:01.534 --> 01:02:03.403
Are we Romeo and Juliet
or something?

1099
01:02:03.403 --> 01:02:04.904
I can't ever spend
enough time with you.

1100
01:02:05.271 --> 01:02:06.439
I'm sorry.

1101
01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:08.174
Bye now.

1102
01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:10.710
What?

1103
01:02:14.114 --> 01:02:16.149
Who's that? Who's that?

1104
01:02:16.649 --> 01:02:17.751
Who's that?

1105
01:02:18.785 --> 01:02:21.054
Who's that? What?

1106
01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:32.632
She's beautiful.

1107
01:02:32.966 --> 01:02:33.967
I know, right?

1108
01:02:36.102 --> 01:02:37.303
By the way, Hyuk.

1109
01:02:37.804 --> 01:02:39.739
She's your
high school crush.

1110
01:02:40.306 --> 01:02:41.541
Do you still like her?

1111
01:02:41.674 --> 01:02:43.209
Shouldn't I?

1112
01:02:43.209 --> 01:02:45.345
You haven't met her
for 10 years.

1113
01:02:45.478 --> 01:02:47.113
That's enough time
to change the mountains.

1114
01:02:47.781 --> 01:02:49.349
Didn't it change
your mind?

1115
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:50.517
It can't possibly change.

1116
01:02:50.784 --> 01:02:53.653
No other woman influenced
me like she did.

1117
01:02:55.822 --> 01:02:58.091
I guess that's
possible then.

1118
01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:10.637
Ji An.

1119
01:03:20.513 --> 01:03:22.015
(Whiner)

1120
01:03:24.284 --> 01:03:26.719
Why do you have to go?

1121
01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:28.421
Can't you stay?

1122
01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:32.992
The number you have dialed
is unavailable...

1123
01:03:32.992 --> 01:03:34.727
Why isn't she picking up?

1124
01:03:35.094 --> 01:03:36.496
Hey, Seo Ji An.

1125
01:03:36.496 --> 01:03:38.264
You wouldn't believe
who I just saw.

1126
01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:46.673
My goodness.

1127
01:03:52.779 --> 01:03:55.014
Pick up, Ji An.

1128
01:03:58.551 --> 01:04:03.556
The number you have dialed
is unavailable.

1129
01:04:08.161 --> 01:04:09.362
Hey, what about
the chairs?

1130
01:04:10.864 --> 01:04:13.099
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang.
I have to go.

1131
01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.767
What?

1132
01:04:15.501 --> 01:04:16.569
Hey.

1133
01:04:36.489 --> 01:04:37.590
Dad.

1134
01:04:38.157 --> 01:04:39.993
Hey, Ji An.

1135
01:04:40.493 --> 01:04:43.129
Why did you want to meet
here? You could go home.

1136
01:04:44.097 --> 01:04:46.232
Have a seat. Sit here.

1137
01:04:50.203 --> 01:04:52.872
Mom told me everything.

1138
01:04:53.406 --> 01:04:54.841
It must've surprised you.

1139
01:04:56.743 --> 01:04:58.077
I'm sorry...

1140
01:04:58.711 --> 01:04:59.846
for leaving.

1141
01:04:59.846 --> 01:05:01.514
Listen to me first.

1142
01:05:02.015 --> 01:05:04.784
There's something
I must tell you.

1143
01:05:06.719 --> 01:05:07.921
Go ahead.

1144
01:05:08.955 --> 01:05:12.558
Don't be surprised
to hear this.

1145
01:05:13.593 --> 01:05:14.694
Sure.

1146
01:05:16.763 --> 01:05:18.031
Ji An,

1147
01:05:19.632 --> 01:05:20.800
you must not...

1148
01:05:21.801 --> 01:05:23.069
go to them.

1149
01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.173
Pardon me?

1150
01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:59.339
(My Golden Life)

1151
01:05:59.739 --> 01:06:01.641
Are you leaving us
for money?

1152
01:06:01.641 --> 01:06:04.010
For money?
Do you know how I lived?

1153
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:06.846
You don't have any rights
to say that to me.

1154
01:06:06.846 --> 01:06:08.214
What do you mean?

1155
01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:10.783
She must've made her
parents suffer.

1156
01:06:12.285 --> 01:06:13.553
You were home.

1157
01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:14.654
How did you find me?

1158
01:06:14.654 --> 01:06:16.022
I was going to bring...

1159
01:06:16.022 --> 01:06:17.423
this 20,500 dollars
to your parents...

1160
01:06:17.423 --> 01:06:19.225
and tell them to take good
care of their daughter.

1161
01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:20.259
What?

1162
01:06:20.994 --> 01:06:22.662
Eun Seok's coming
tomorrow?

1163
01:06:23.262 --> 01:06:25.765
Don't be discouraged
when you go there.

1164
01:06:25.932 --> 01:06:27.467
Live your life.

1165
01:06:28.534 --> 01:06:30.903
I trust Ji An.

1166
01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:32.572
I trust my daughter.
