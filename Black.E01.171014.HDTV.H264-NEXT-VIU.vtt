(Episode 1)

4
00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:34.598
Is this me?

5
00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.709
This is me?

6
00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.378
This is really me?

7
00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:54.788
(Black)

8
00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:02.799
- Guys, hurry up. - Yes, sir.

9
00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:04.869
These idiots. Why didn't they fold this in?

10
00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.468
- Move over. We don't have time. - Please move out of the way.

11
00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:09.098
Please cooperate.

12
00:03:09.198 --> 00:03:11.239
- I'm sorry. - What is going on?

13
00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.538
Hurry up already!

14
00:03:12.538 --> 00:03:14.908
If you're going to loiter around, just go play golf instead.

15
00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.978
- Where's the body? - This way, sir.

16
00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:20.209
Gosh, this rain.

17
00:03:21.248 --> 00:03:22.448
Would you say it's well preserved?

18
00:03:22.748 --> 00:03:24.649
It's been left for too long, but we're trying.

19
00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:27.788
From the size of his skull, the temporal bone,

20
00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.989
and skullcap, I'm convinced that it's a male.

21
00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:32.628
I'm not sure exactly when he died,

22
00:03:32.788 --> 00:03:34.258
but I think it happened just over a decade ago.

23
00:03:34.258 --> 00:03:35.329
A decade?

24
00:03:37.028 --> 00:03:38.369
- Look at this mess. - Gosh.

25
00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:39.869
Hey, hey!

26
00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.299
You idiot!

27
00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:47.579
Han Moo Gang, that loser. How many times has he done this?

28
00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.938
You just ruined the evidence!

29
00:03:48.938 --> 00:03:50.179
- Gosh! - This is crazy.

30
00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.348
Get lost.

31
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:54.718
Gosh, that idiot.

32
00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.649
What on earth did he eat? Goodness.

33
00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.158
You idiot! Had you closed your teeth together,

34
00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:03.619
only the liquid would've come out!

35
00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:05.489
He actually threw up food. Gosh.

36
00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.929
I'm so annoyed right now.

37
00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:09.498
What's the cause of death?

38
00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:12.669
Judging from the crack in the skull, I think he was murdered.

39
00:04:13.498 --> 00:04:14.998
Gosh, seriously.

40
00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:17.739
Why did they partner me up with that loser?

41
00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.838
That guy will ruin my career.

42
00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:23.078
What?

43
00:04:23.878 --> 00:04:25.078
What is...

44
00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.248
What is this?

45
00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:31.388
What do you think this is?

46
00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:40.729
Your stomach must be empty because you threw up everything.

47
00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.799
Let's grab a quick bite here. We have the team dinner later.

48
00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:47.638
I'll get a barbecue burger and soda.

49
00:04:47.638 --> 00:04:49.568
I don't have any appetite right now.

50
00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:55.138
Why? You don't feel like eating because you just saw skeletons?

51
00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:57.239
You better go in before I make you gulp down bone soup.

52
00:04:58.109 --> 00:04:59.948
Didn't you say you were feeling queasy?

53
00:05:14.698 --> 00:05:16.099
It's been a long time, Ha Ram.

54
00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:21.539
How long has it been?

55
00:05:22.638 --> 00:05:24.539
773 days and 5 hours.

56
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:26.438
Your order?

57
00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.508
The shrimp burger couple set.

58
00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:33.679
Signature.

59
00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.518
Your order?

60
00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:44.859
- Pardon me? - Your order.

61
00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.529
Oh, one barbecue burger...

62
00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:50.659
and soda, please. By any chance,

63
00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:54.898
can I order half a cup of Americano? I can't, right?

64
00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:56.369
Then I'll just get that.

65
00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.409
- Hey! - Yes? I wanted to use up my change.

66
00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:00.938
Gosh, that startled me.

67
00:06:01.338 --> 00:06:02.679
I told you to take that off.

68
00:06:03.638 --> 00:06:06.309
It'll repel customers!

69
00:06:07.748 --> 00:06:09.578
They'll find me even more repulsive without it.

70
00:06:09.748 --> 00:06:10.748
For goodness' sake.

71
00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.088
Is this funny to you?

72
00:06:17.258 --> 00:06:19.289
You little... Do you think this is a joke?

73
00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:24.599
Your order?

74
00:06:25.698 --> 00:06:26.828
Your order?

75
00:06:27.068 --> 00:06:29.299
- Sorry? - Are you deaf?

76
00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:31.708
Finish your order. One barbecue burger and what?

77
00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:34.039
I'll get one barbecue burger and soda.

78
00:06:35.378 --> 00:06:38.409
Is it really not possible to order just half a cup of Americano?

79
00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:42.779
What are you looking at?

80
00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.049
Shall I poke your eyes with utility poles?

81
00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:49.088
Or shall I spoon your eyeballs and suck all the fluid out of them?

82
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:11.248
Here's your shrimp burger couple set.

83
00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:14.518
Stay for three more minutes.

84
00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:16.448
What are you doing?

85
00:07:17.378 --> 00:07:19.849
- Just three more minutes. - What are you saying? Let go.

86
00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:21.719
Then wait for just a minute.

87
00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:23.789
Stay here for just one minute.

88
00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:30.258
What is it again? What?

89
00:07:30.258 --> 00:07:32.669
It was my mom last time. Is it me now?

90
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:41.809
You haven't changed at all.

91
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:44.979
Do you know why I dumped you?

92
00:07:47.648 --> 00:07:49.849
It's because you bring misfortune.

93
00:07:50.378 --> 00:07:51.518
Let go of me.

94
00:08:11.838 --> 00:08:13.169
Oh, my goodness!

95
00:08:14.438 --> 00:08:15.938
- Oh, no! - What just happened?

96
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:19.609
He must be dead.

97
00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.929
What's wrong with that woman?

98
00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:51.909
(Die hard! Never die!)

99
00:08:59.188 --> 00:09:01.259
(For unfortunate days)

100
00:09:12.098 --> 00:09:14.899
Are you okay? It must've startled you.

101
00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:18.909
Well, I've been through this a lot.

102
00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:23.039
Oh, my. This isn't so nice of me to drink it alone.

103
00:09:25.948 --> 00:09:27.618
Would you like some?

104
00:09:30.478 --> 00:09:32.188
Why do you look like that?

105
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:33.889
Did something happen?

106
00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:35.289
Something?

107
00:09:36.988 --> 00:09:38.328
Something happened indeed.

108
00:09:41.098 --> 00:09:42.899
Do you remember Dong Won?

109
00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:46.929
I saw him after 773 days and 5 hours.

110
00:09:47.698 --> 00:09:50.338
What a coincidence to run into him at a burger place.

111
00:09:50.338 --> 00:09:51.639
But...

112
00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:54.909
he said...

113
00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.679
I'm unfortunate.

114
00:10:00.848 --> 00:10:04.488
Gosh, how ridiculous. He's the unfortunate one.

115
00:10:05.618 --> 00:10:07.919
I told him to stay for one minute.

116
00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:09.458
Why did he have to leave?

117
00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:12.789
I lost my grip...

118
00:10:13.588 --> 00:10:15.598
when he said I bring misfortune.

119
00:10:22.468 --> 00:10:24.208
I should've stopped him.

120
00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:30.108
Did he die because of me?

121
00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:35.318
Did he really die because...

122
00:10:35.318 --> 00:10:37.718
I bring misfortune?

123
00:10:40.318 --> 00:10:41.488
That's right.

124
00:10:42.188 --> 00:10:43.818
It's because of me.

125
00:10:43.818 --> 00:10:46.728
I think it is. He died because of me.

126
00:10:46.728 --> 00:10:48.458
It's all my fault.

127
00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:50.629
Dad.

128
00:10:51.129 --> 00:10:53.269
Dad!

129
00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:58.608
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

130
00:10:58.608 --> 00:11:01.779
Why does it only happen to me? Why?

131
00:11:03.478 --> 00:11:05.848
It's okay. You're okay.

132
00:11:05.848 --> 00:11:08.179
Ha Ram, don't worry.

133
00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:11.389
Daddy will make your eyes okay.

134
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:16.988
Ta-da. It's a magical pair of sunglasses.

135
00:11:23.698 --> 00:11:26.629
If you wear these, you won't see any of the scary stuff.

136
00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:28.799
If I wear these,

137
00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:31.338
will I really not see the scary things?

138
00:11:31.338 --> 00:11:32.669
You won't.

139
00:11:49.718 --> 00:11:50.759
Dad.

140
00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:56.198
I can't watch it anymore.

141
00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:00.468
I can't do this anymore.

142
00:12:08.179 --> 00:12:09.309
I'm sorry, sir.

143
00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:11.809
You brat.

144
00:12:12.049 --> 00:12:14.419
Hey, you should eat.

145
00:12:14.419 --> 00:12:17.019
I heard you've been throwing up all day.

146
00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:18.618
Your stomach must be empty.

147
00:12:18.618 --> 00:12:19.749
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:20.649 --> 00:12:23.188
We have the liver, heart,

149
00:12:23.488 --> 00:12:24.728
and intestine.

150
00:12:24.728 --> 00:12:27.759
Gosh, look at this. It's the tongue.

151
00:12:28.728 --> 00:12:32.568
There must be some tongue in beef tripe and intestine soup.

152
00:12:33.429 --> 00:12:35.769
What? Oh, goodness.

153
00:12:36.468 --> 00:12:37.568
Look at this.

154
00:12:38.708 --> 00:12:40.009
It's an eye.

155
00:12:41.179 --> 00:12:43.639
This is a delicacy, you know.

156
00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:53.118
It's so juicy.

157
00:12:54.188 --> 00:12:55.988
Hey, hey.

158
00:12:55.988 --> 00:12:57.458
Where are you going?

159
00:12:58.228 --> 00:13:01.429
Why did you stick a bean in a quail egg and trick him?

160
00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:03.799
He got shocked and ran away.

161
00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:05.598
Who hired that brat?

162
00:13:05.598 --> 00:13:07.299
You did.

163
00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:09.539
Give me someone else as a partner!

164
00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:16.639
- It looks good. - Eat up.

165
00:13:16.738 --> 00:13:17.809
Hey.

166
00:13:19.608 --> 00:13:21.049
What are you doing?

167
00:13:21.049 --> 00:13:22.779
- What is this? - What are you doing, you punk?

168
00:13:26.818 --> 00:13:28.188
- Boss! - Oh, no.

169
00:13:28.188 --> 00:13:30.088
What do you think you're doing?

170
00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:35.299
We'll kill you.

171
00:13:35.299 --> 00:13:37.698
Let go of me.

172
00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.769
Get up. Get up, you punk.

173
00:13:40.769 --> 00:13:43.039
- You little... - Darn it.

174
00:13:44.169 --> 00:13:46.409
- Hey. No! - Don't...

175
00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:49.039
Why are you doing this to me?

176
00:13:49.809 --> 00:13:51.179
Come here, punk!

177
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.749
Hey, move.

178
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:56.948
You punk. Come here.

179
00:13:58.818 --> 00:13:59.889
Hey!

180
00:13:59.889 --> 00:14:03.818
The detectives are having a team dinner here.

181
00:14:03.818 --> 00:14:06.588
What's with all the noise? I'll arrest you all for...

182
00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:09.429
What are you doing over there, Moo Gang?

183
00:14:09.858 --> 00:14:11.198
Detective Han.

184
00:14:12.568 --> 00:14:13.629
Detective?

185
00:14:14.999 --> 00:14:17.708
How dare you beat him up like that?

186
00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:19.539
- What's going on? - Get them!

187
00:14:19.539 --> 00:14:21.509
- Hey! - How dare you!

188
00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:57.039
Gosh, it's red bean noodle soup.

189
00:14:57.039 --> 00:14:59.279
It's your birthday today.

190
00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:02.749
I made some since it's your favorite.

191
00:15:03.478 --> 00:15:04.718
It'll be good.

192
00:15:06.549 --> 00:15:09.618
Oh, right. Moo Gang. Look over there.

193
00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.789
That's your birthday present.

194
00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:12.789
What?

195
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:14.598
Present?

196
00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:18.429
You didn't have to.

197
00:15:22.769 --> 00:15:24.208
What is this?

198
00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:27.838
This is a limited edition for the 40th anniversary of "Robot Jjippa".

199
00:15:28.379 --> 00:15:31.108
Gosh, they're not even in the stores yet.

200
00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:33.379
Moo Gang. Here.

201
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:35.549
Mother says it's your medicine for this month.

202
00:15:35.848 --> 00:15:36.919
My medicine?

203
00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:40.718
I guess I should take it.

204
00:15:42.088 --> 00:15:44.488
You should call your mother more often.

205
00:15:45.688 --> 00:15:47.029
I know.

206
00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.698
But she doesn't answer my calls anyway.

207
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:54.198
Can't you reconsider?

208
00:15:54.198 --> 00:15:56.499
Do you have to be a detective? You aren't cut out for it.

209
00:15:56.499 --> 00:15:59.208
- Your mother hates it so much. - I'm starving.

210
00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:00.338
I'll go wash up.

211
00:16:00.738 --> 00:16:02.539
Gosh, it smells fantastic.

212
00:16:43.049 --> 00:16:45.649
Hi. Did you look into it?

213
00:16:46.549 --> 00:16:47.618
Yes.

214
00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:58.169
Oh, that's right. The picture.

215
00:17:00.068 --> 00:17:01.098
Hold on.

216
00:17:23.388 --> 00:17:25.628
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome on board.

217
00:17:25.729 --> 00:17:27.759
I'm your captain, Yoky Raine,

218
00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:30.098
and our destination is Helsinki, Finland.

219
00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.799
We'll now be preparing for takeoff.

220
00:17:52.219 --> 00:17:54.289
My sunglasses. Where did my sunglasses go?

221
00:17:57.459 --> 00:18:01.428
Hi, sweetie. That's mine. Give it back.

222
00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:02.729
- I don't want to. - You don't want to?

223
00:18:02.729 --> 00:18:04.328
Don't say that. You have to give it back.

224
00:18:04.729 --> 00:18:07.269
Please take it off and give it back. You'll be in trouble. Come on.

225
00:18:07.469 --> 00:18:08.638
I don't want to!

226
00:18:46.509 --> 00:18:50.239
Stop! Stop immediately! Don't take off!

227
00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.949
You need to stop. Right now!

228
00:18:52.949 --> 00:18:54.979
Stop this airplane immediately!

229
00:18:55.279 --> 00:18:57.418
- What's the problem? Calm down. - No.

230
00:18:57.418 --> 00:18:58.749
No, no!

231
00:19:00.019 --> 00:19:01.818
Go away! Get away from me!

232
00:19:01.818 --> 00:19:04.088
Go away! I said, go away!

233
00:19:05.489 --> 00:19:08.358
You cannot let this plane take off. You absolutely shouldn't.

234
00:19:08.358 --> 00:19:10.428
This airplane must not take off!

235
00:19:11.469 --> 00:19:13.769
Open this door! Right now!

236
00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:16.299
Stop this airplane.

237
00:19:21.108 --> 00:19:24.979
Get off. You all need to get off. The plane can't take off!

238
00:19:25.608 --> 00:19:27.578
Everyone will die!

239
00:19:27.878 --> 00:19:30.348
Please believe me!

240
00:19:30.648 --> 00:19:31.848
Mister.

241
00:19:32.818 --> 00:19:35.088
This is hers.

242
00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:45.729
Please, no.

243
00:19:45.868 --> 00:19:49.098
We can't let the plane take off. It cannot take off!

244
00:19:49.269 --> 00:19:51.309
Everyone on that plane will die!

245
00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.979
Breaking news. A Helsinki-bound airplane that left...

246
00:20:02.979 --> 00:20:06.388
Incheon International Airport at 6am today...

247
00:20:06.618 --> 00:20:08.519
- crashed while flying over... - Hey, everyone died.

248
00:20:08.519 --> 00:20:10.459
Hey, Man Soo. Will that affect you at all?

249
00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:12.059
Aren't you in the insurance department?

250
00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:13.428
That has nothing to do with...

251
00:20:14.959 --> 00:20:17.098
- It actually will affect me a lot. - I'm doing it right now!

252
00:20:17.098 --> 00:20:18.828
There would be a ton of work if it was a full flight.

253
00:20:19.269 --> 00:20:20.598
What should I do? Gosh.

254
00:20:21.999 --> 00:20:24.838
You guys! Can't you see that it's a state of emergency?

255
00:20:24.969 --> 00:20:26.709
Aren't you watching the news?

256
00:20:26.868 --> 00:20:29.838
How can you get drunk in broad daylight and make prank calls?

257
00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:31.979
Look at him. Does his face look okay to you?

258
00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:33.509
It's totally beaten up.

259
00:20:34.618 --> 00:20:37.549
Gosh, I really didn't do anything.

260
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:41.759
I only said that he shouldn't make prank calls.

261
00:20:42.318 --> 00:20:45.559
He's right. Those two guys beat him up.

262
00:20:45.628 --> 00:20:47.388
That loser just tried to stop the fight.

263
00:20:48.729 --> 00:20:51.168
Anyway, I absolutely will not settle.

264
00:20:51.168 --> 00:20:52.969
I'll be sure to put these jerks behind bars.

265
00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:56.598
What? A global star, a corporate heir, and a sports star?

266
00:20:56.699 --> 00:20:59.138
Brace yourselves. I'll tell reporters everything!

267
00:20:59.138 --> 00:21:00.939
- You jerk. - How dare you!

268
00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:03.279
- Bring it on! - Break it up!

269
00:21:04.949 --> 00:21:08.249
Hey, why are you going through the list of missing men?

270
00:21:08.749 --> 00:21:10.378
Do we already have the DNA test results?

271
00:21:11.249 --> 00:21:12.689
Gosh, seriously.

272
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:14.959
Didn't Moo Gang tell you when he was dropping this off?

273
00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:17.989
So it's a woman. He didn't say anything.

274
00:21:17.989 --> 00:21:19.059
What happened?

275
00:21:19.289 --> 00:21:20.289
Oh, no.

276
00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:22.358
Are you okay?

277
00:21:27.638 --> 00:21:28.638
I'm sorry.

278
00:21:29.699 --> 00:21:32.608
Hey, you really don't know what this is?

279
00:21:35.309 --> 00:21:38.709
Are you clueless or dumb?

280
00:21:39.709 --> 00:21:41.378
Hey, do this with your hands.

281
00:21:41.479 --> 00:21:42.979
- Like this? - That's the ready position.

282
00:21:43.118 --> 00:21:44.388
Stay just like that, okay?

283
00:21:47.719 --> 00:21:49.759
Now, put them over your chest.

284
00:21:51.959 --> 00:21:54.299
- Oh, these are women's... - That's right, you idiot.

285
00:21:54.759 --> 00:21:57.328
How can these not have rotten when the victim died over 10 years ago?

286
00:21:57.699 --> 00:22:01.269
Silicone doesn't decay even after a century, you dimwit.

287
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:04.338
Gosh, didn't you go to an elite university in the States?

288
00:22:05.209 --> 00:22:07.539
Hey, be honest with me.

289
00:22:08.408 --> 00:22:09.878
You must've faked your academic credentials.

290
00:22:09.878 --> 00:22:12.148
I studied accounting which has nothing to do with any of this.

291
00:22:12.148 --> 00:22:15.479
You're such a loser. Why did you study accounting out of everything?

292
00:22:15.848 --> 00:22:18.219
There's no match.

293
00:22:19.418 --> 00:22:21.618
- Nothing at all? - No.

294
00:22:21.888 --> 00:22:26.128
I went through the missing women records from the last 20 years,

295
00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:27.499
but there's no match.

296
00:22:28.628 --> 00:22:29.828
What is it, then?

297
00:22:30.199 --> 00:22:32.699
This woman probably wasn't even reported missing.

298
00:22:39.168 --> 00:22:41.209
By the way, where will we find the information we need?

299
00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:43.838
About what?

300
00:22:44.009 --> 00:22:47.449
The skeletons we found. She wasn't found in our data base.

301
00:22:47.578 --> 00:22:50.449
Hey, they say that there's more than one way to skin a cat.

302
00:22:53.118 --> 00:22:54.689
You see the numbers on them, right?

303
00:22:55.989 --> 00:22:58.388
- Right there. That's it. - Yes.

304
00:22:58.529 --> 00:23:00.189
It's the manufacturer's serial number.

305
00:23:00.229 --> 00:23:04.598
That number will tell us the manufacturer name, which hospital...

306
00:23:04.598 --> 00:23:07.939
they supplied to, and the name of the patient who got the surgery,

307
00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:09.199
so go find out everything.

308
00:23:09.199 --> 00:23:11.368
The numbers got erased because these are old.

309
00:23:11.709 --> 00:23:13.908
Gosh, do you have all the time in the world or what?

310
00:23:14.408 --> 00:23:17.809
Hey, who can decipher things that are not even visible?

311
00:23:19.009 --> 00:23:20.078
What do you mean?

312
00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:23.019
The eyes of the Six Million Dollar Man.

313
00:23:23.019 --> 00:23:24.949
The ears of the Bionic Woman. Don't you know?

314
00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:27.348
All detectives must have such abilities.

315
00:23:27.348 --> 00:23:30.789
Anyhow, find out no matter what. You got that?

316
00:23:31.588 --> 00:23:32.628
Okay.

317
00:23:40.469 --> 00:23:42.199
Am I supposed to laugh or what?

318
00:23:48.709 --> 00:23:50.848
Don't touch me, pervert!

319
00:23:50.979 --> 00:23:52.549
Get your hands off of me.

320
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:55.818
- Are you going to keep this up? - Let go! Let go of me first.

321
00:23:56.078 --> 00:23:57.789
- Let go! - Who is that woman?

322
00:23:57.789 --> 00:24:00.189
Let go of me first! I said, let go!

323
00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:02.088
- Tidy up, guys. - Let go of me, please!

324
00:24:05.088 --> 00:24:07.499
I'm serious. I didn't do anything.

325
00:24:07.499 --> 00:24:10.299
Then why did you get off the plane just before takeoff?

326
00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:12.328
I didn't get off voluntarily. I was dragged out.

327
00:24:12.598 --> 00:24:13.969
How did you know that everyone would die?

328
00:24:14.939 --> 00:24:17.338
Answer me! Are you a terrorist?

329
00:24:20.368 --> 00:24:24.279
How did you know about the crash if it wasn't your doing?

330
00:24:25.378 --> 00:24:26.578
Hey, Miss!

331
00:24:27.108 --> 00:24:28.418
This is a very serious matter!

332
00:24:28.848 --> 00:24:31.489
You must tell me the truth for me to help you.

333
00:24:31.949 --> 00:24:33.689
How did you know that everyone would die?

334
00:24:38.729 --> 00:24:40.158
I saw the shadow.

335
00:24:41.098 --> 00:24:42.098
What?

336
00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:45.469
The shadow.

337
00:24:47.598 --> 00:24:49.769
I can see the shadow of death.

338
00:24:51.739 --> 00:24:54.779
I've never seen so many of them before.

339
00:24:57.078 --> 00:24:58.509
She can foresee death?

340
00:25:00.479 --> 00:25:01.749
Oh, she's...

341
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:03.749
I saw her at the burger joint.

342
00:25:07.888 --> 00:25:09.759
Gosh, honey! Honey.

343
00:25:10.618 --> 00:25:12.888
What on earth happened? Gosh, honey.

344
00:25:12.888 --> 00:25:16.999
Who's the jerk that did this to you? How can you beat up someone's face?

345
00:25:16.999 --> 00:25:18.199
How could you do this?

346
00:25:18.199 --> 00:25:19.469
- Ma'am. - Hey!

347
00:25:19.628 --> 00:25:20.799
You're very beautiful.

348
00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:22.239
Gosh, hello.

349
00:25:23.439 --> 00:25:24.969
Do I know you?

350
00:25:25.338 --> 00:25:28.979
I work as an insurance planner at Royal Insurance.

351
00:25:29.078 --> 00:25:30.809
My name is Han Jin Sook.

352
00:25:31.648 --> 00:25:32.908
She's your employee?

353
00:25:34.108 --> 00:25:36.749
That's great. Just compensate them well.

354
00:25:37.148 --> 00:25:39.219
- What did you just say? - Gosh, please don't do this!

355
00:25:40.148 --> 00:25:41.519
- Let go! - Gosh!

356
00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:42.959
- My goodness. - Are you okay?

357
00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:43.959
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

358
00:25:51.598 --> 00:25:52.828
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine.

359
00:25:53.928 --> 00:25:55.368
- Calm down. - Gosh, these jerks.

360
00:25:56.499 --> 00:25:57.739
Will you guys settle or not?

361
00:25:57.739 --> 00:26:00.368
Pardon me? Oh, let's just settle, honey.

362
00:26:00.368 --> 00:26:03.209
- What are you talking about? - Yes. We'll settle.

363
00:26:03.209 --> 00:26:04.949
- Take them and get them to sign it. - Yes, sir.

364
00:26:05.078 --> 00:26:06.949
- I won't settle. - Go on. Let's go.

365
00:26:06.949 --> 00:26:08.049
Yes, we're coming.

366
00:26:08.178 --> 00:26:09.678
That woman has it too.

367
00:26:11.348 --> 00:26:12.618
What? She has what?

368
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:14.959
The shadow.

369
00:26:15.418 --> 00:26:16.689
The shadow of death.

370
00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:18.729
She'll die soon too.

371
00:26:24.699 --> 00:26:25.928
Is she a fortune-teller?

372
00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:31.469
Oh, right.

373
00:26:31.739 --> 00:26:32.868
Shoot.

374
00:26:48.588 --> 00:26:50.888
You didn't send a car?

375
00:26:50.888 --> 00:26:52.529
I waited for a while.

376
00:26:54.358 --> 00:26:59.269
Well, it's fine. I can use my two legs, you know.

377
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:02.638
Stop wasting your life. I want you to take over Insurance.

378
00:27:03.739 --> 00:27:06.039
Sorry? Insurance?

379
00:27:08.509 --> 00:27:10.809
You mean, Royal Insurance?

380
00:27:11.108 --> 00:27:12.809
Are you asking me to...

381
00:27:14.178 --> 00:27:18.618
Gosh, thank you so much. I'll do my very best. Thank you.

382
00:27:23.158 --> 00:27:24.388
I'm sorry.

383
00:27:27.499 --> 00:27:29.898
Think of your position and behave.

384
00:27:30.628 --> 00:27:32.499
I don't expect much from you.

385
00:27:32.499 --> 00:27:35.098
Just don't ruin the image of Royal.

386
00:27:35.668 --> 00:27:36.739
Of course not.

387
00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:40.209
I will make Royal Insurance the best insurance company...

388
00:27:40.209 --> 00:27:43.108
in our country. Thank you.

389
00:27:52.019 --> 00:27:53.418
Royal Insurance.

390
00:27:55.418 --> 00:27:57.789
These are all so expensive.

391
00:28:15.309 --> 00:28:17.949
Thank you.

392
00:28:17.949 --> 00:28:20.979
I don't care who you are.

393
00:28:20.979 --> 00:28:22.418
Thank you...

394
00:28:27.418 --> 00:28:28.789
Is someone sick?

395
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:32.888
Hey.

396
00:28:33.189 --> 00:28:35.398
I told you not to watch it in front of the dog.

397
00:28:35.658 --> 00:28:38.328
You have your own laptop. Why do you always use mine?

398
00:28:38.328 --> 00:28:40.398
Dad locked my laptop.

399
00:28:40.398 --> 00:28:42.068
Don't be so happy, Uncle Man Soo.

400
00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:44.469
I know that you're an outcast of our family,

401
00:28:44.769 --> 00:28:48.108
but how can you know so little about how things are at the company?

402
00:28:48.108 --> 00:28:49.908
You just turned 30 now.

403
00:28:50.338 --> 00:28:52.848
Do you think it makes sense that you'll be the president...

404
00:28:53.348 --> 00:28:55.049
of Royal Insurance?

405
00:28:55.348 --> 00:28:58.088
You just don't know how capable I am.

406
00:28:58.088 --> 00:29:00.019
Dad and the board of directors...

407
00:29:00.019 --> 00:29:02.789
teamed up and made you the representative.

408
00:29:02.959 --> 00:29:03.989
What?

409
00:29:03.989 --> 00:29:06.658
I overheard Mom and Dad talking on the phone.

410
00:29:06.658 --> 00:29:10.199
They said Royal Insurance is a big nuisance now.

411
00:29:10.229 --> 00:29:13.499
They had to pay tens of millions of dollars when there was a fire at...

412
00:29:13.499 --> 00:29:14.999
Samjeong Department Store last year.

413
00:29:15.638 --> 00:29:18.809
They have to pay a lot again because of today's plane accident.

414
00:29:18.809 --> 00:29:22.279
I knew they shouldn't have insured foreign airlines.

415
00:29:22.638 --> 00:29:23.939
Gosh, your dad.

416
00:29:25.348 --> 00:29:26.408
Anyway,

417
00:29:27.009 --> 00:29:29.749
they will sell it to China before it goes bankrupt.

418
00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:32.888
That means you've become...

419
00:29:33.689 --> 00:29:36.318
the captain of a ship that will sink soon.

420
00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:37.828
Good luck.

421
00:29:43.729 --> 00:29:45.428
He's going to blame me...

422
00:29:45.799 --> 00:29:48.368
for its insolvency and sell the company?

423
00:29:48.368 --> 00:29:49.398
That means...

424
00:29:51.309 --> 00:29:53.668
he wants me to take all the blame.

425
00:29:55.138 --> 00:29:56.939
Gosh, I knew it.

426
00:30:01.749 --> 00:30:04.418
You sensed it was strange too, right?

427
00:30:08.289 --> 00:30:09.618
What's wrong with your face?

428
00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:13.088
Why do you have gunk in your eye? Are you sick?

429
00:30:22.568 --> 00:30:25.439
This isn't your department. Why do you keep hovering around?

430
00:30:25.439 --> 00:30:27.578
Well... What happened to that woman?

431
00:30:27.578 --> 00:30:28.578
Did you release her?

432
00:30:28.578 --> 00:30:31.309
Who? You mean the crazy girl?

433
00:30:33.848 --> 00:30:36.578
Is she really crazy? What did she say?

434
00:30:37.888 --> 00:30:39.888
She's exercising her right to remain silent.

435
00:30:39.888 --> 00:30:42.318
She won't say anything.

436
00:30:44.729 --> 00:30:47.229
Where is she? Where is that crazy girl?

437
00:30:47.229 --> 00:30:49.628
Where did that crazy girl go?

438
00:30:50.459 --> 00:30:52.769
You. You brat.

439
00:30:52.928 --> 00:30:56.039
What nonsense did you rattle on again this time? What?

440
00:30:56.499 --> 00:30:58.969
My goodness, you crazy wench!

441
00:30:58.969 --> 00:31:02.709
Let's just kill ourselves together today.

442
00:31:02.709 --> 00:31:05.108
- Let's just die! - Stop!

443
00:31:05.108 --> 00:31:06.549
Please calm down.

444
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:08.549
If you want to kill yourself, go ahead.

445
00:31:09.219 --> 00:31:12.118
I'm strong enough to survive alone from that plane,

446
00:31:12.118 --> 00:31:13.949
so if you want to die, die alone!

447
00:31:13.949 --> 00:31:16.289
You and your darn mouth.

448
00:31:16.289 --> 00:31:19.658
You wench. I told you to keep your mouth shut.

449
00:31:20.088 --> 00:31:22.928
I told you to keep your eyes closed!

450
00:31:22.928 --> 00:31:24.828
You crazy wench!

451
00:31:24.828 --> 00:31:26.699
That crazy wench.

452
00:31:27.668 --> 00:31:30.469
- Goodness. - Please have a seat here.

453
00:31:30.469 --> 00:31:31.608
Oh, gosh.

454
00:31:31.608 --> 00:31:34.239
Here, please sit.

455
00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:39.209
That girl isn't normal.

456
00:31:40.078 --> 00:31:41.749
She's insane.

457
00:31:41.749 --> 00:31:43.279
(Seoun Police Station)

458
00:31:52.959 --> 00:31:54.029
What is this?

459
00:31:57.229 --> 00:31:58.328
You're awake.

460
00:31:58.769 --> 00:32:02.838
It was broken, so I fixed it.

461
00:32:07.739 --> 00:32:09.009
Listen.

462
00:32:11.749 --> 00:32:14.779
Do you remember me by any chance?

463
00:32:15.178 --> 00:32:16.578
I saw you a few days ago.

464
00:32:17.818 --> 00:32:20.689
At the burger place on the day of the truck accident.

465
00:32:21.158 --> 00:32:22.358
I don't know.

466
00:32:22.358 --> 00:32:23.559
Wait.

467
00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:27.059
Why do you always cover your eyes? They're beautiful.

468
00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:31.668
You have beautiful eyes.

469
00:32:33.199 --> 00:32:35.568
Why do you always cover them? They're beautiful.

470
00:32:39.668 --> 00:32:42.338
Do you wear sunglasses to avoid seeing the shadows?

471
00:32:43.578 --> 00:32:45.009
Did you hear it?

472
00:32:46.408 --> 00:32:47.519
Yes.

473
00:32:47.719 --> 00:32:50.719
Do you believe me?

474
00:32:51.189 --> 00:32:53.418
Not exactly,

475
00:32:53.918 --> 00:32:55.519
but that's what you said.

476
00:33:04.199 --> 00:33:07.299
Do you not see the shadows if you wear them?

477
00:33:13.108 --> 00:33:15.408
Shadows are black.

478
00:33:15.408 --> 00:33:17.648
When I wear black sunglasses, I don't see them.

479
00:33:18.749 --> 00:33:20.979
At the burger place the other day,

480
00:33:20.979 --> 00:33:22.678
did your ex-boyfriend...

481
00:33:23.348 --> 00:33:24.449
I mean...

482
00:33:24.749 --> 00:33:29.019
Well... Did the guy in the accident have...

483
00:33:29.418 --> 00:33:31.229
a shadow as well?

484
00:33:34.828 --> 00:33:38.769
Did you also know that he'd be hit by a truck and die?

485
00:33:42.239 --> 00:33:43.368
How?

486
00:33:43.838 --> 00:33:45.709
If I touch the shadow,

487
00:33:45.709 --> 00:33:48.039
I can see the moment that person dies.

488
00:33:49.338 --> 00:33:50.408
What?

489
00:33:51.678 --> 00:33:54.049
I saw him getting hit by a truck and die,

490
00:33:54.378 --> 00:33:57.219
so I tried to make him stay until the truck passes.

491
00:34:02.759 --> 00:34:04.388
You don't believe me, do you?

492
00:34:05.759 --> 00:34:09.328
You say you see shadows, and it's just a little funny...

493
00:34:10.258 --> 00:34:12.368
No, I believe you.

494
00:34:13.198 --> 00:34:14.769
I believe you, of course.

495
00:34:15.499 --> 00:34:17.868
The little girl who sat next to me on the plane.

496
00:34:18.939 --> 00:34:21.508
I should've gotten off the plane with her at least.

497
00:34:24.008 --> 00:34:26.778
I can't stop thinking about her.

498
00:34:30.319 --> 00:34:34.319
My eyes are cursed. People are right.

499
00:34:34.319 --> 00:34:37.289
I'm a cursed monster.

500
00:34:43.499 --> 00:34:44.999
That's...

501
00:34:48.238 --> 00:34:50.169
It has been revealed...

502
00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:52.439
that the cause of the recent plane crash...

503
00:34:52.439 --> 00:34:54.138
was not an act of terrorism,

504
00:34:54.138 --> 00:34:56.709
but a defect of the aircraft.

505
00:34:56.908 --> 00:34:59.649
The airline and the investigation officials analyzed the blackbox...

506
00:34:59.649 --> 00:35:01.778
and the debris from the crash.

507
00:35:01.778 --> 00:35:03.479
They confirmed that...

508
00:35:03.479 --> 00:35:06.718
a part of the compressor inside the engine was broken.

509
00:35:06.718 --> 00:35:08.289
It was a defect in the aircraft.

510
00:35:08.289 --> 00:35:10.789
They concluded that the crash occurred due to the defect.

511
00:35:11.959 --> 00:35:14.559
I can just smash the heads of those jerks.

512
00:35:14.899 --> 00:35:17.428
They accused an innocent person of being a terrorist.

513
00:35:18.968 --> 00:35:22.468
I will report you all to the UN's human rights office.

514
00:35:24.508 --> 00:35:27.468
Hi. I heard the news on my way to work.

515
00:35:27.468 --> 00:35:29.209
I'm glad the misunderstanding cleared up.

516
00:35:30.539 --> 00:35:31.649
Are you going home?

517
00:35:32.448 --> 00:35:34.008
Give me a ride home, please.

518
00:35:34.008 --> 00:35:35.919
No, I just came to work...

519
00:35:36.319 --> 00:35:37.419
Excuse me.

520
00:35:40.819 --> 00:35:42.658
No one gets off work in the morning.

521
00:35:46.629 --> 00:35:47.899
You see,

522
00:35:48.698 --> 00:35:51.598
I'm a very precious son to my parents.

523
00:35:51.698 --> 00:35:53.229
I'm a third-generation only son.

524
00:35:53.229 --> 00:35:55.798
When I was little, my mom set up a different table just for me.

525
00:36:04.078 --> 00:36:06.479
My gosh, she's giving me all kinds of trouble.

526
00:36:29.968 --> 00:36:32.069
There he goes again.

527
00:36:33.638 --> 00:36:35.109
He's going to die.

528
00:36:39.809 --> 00:36:41.178
I can see a shadow.

529
00:36:42.078 --> 00:36:43.149
What?

530
00:36:43.718 --> 00:36:45.388
He is Leo's manager.

531
00:36:45.548 --> 00:36:46.749
Do you know him?

532
00:36:48.189 --> 00:36:50.488
Don't worry. He will never jump.

533
00:36:51.189 --> 00:36:53.359
He's famous around here.

534
00:36:53.689 --> 00:36:56.098
He's been up on this bridge every morning for the last two years.

535
00:36:56.098 --> 00:36:57.868
A few months ago,

536
00:36:57.868 --> 00:37:00.069
he was doing the same thing,

537
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:01.539
and he missed his step.

538
00:37:01.539 --> 00:37:03.098
He actually almost fell off the bridge.

539
00:37:03.098 --> 00:37:04.709
Then he hung on to the handrail,

540
00:37:04.709 --> 00:37:07.069
and he wouldn't stop crying out for help.

541
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:09.309
Gosh, he will never kill himself.

542
00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:10.379
Don't you worry.

543
00:37:10.578 --> 00:37:13.379
You said you believe me. You're a big fat liar.

544
00:37:14.319 --> 00:37:15.348
What?

545
00:37:15.548 --> 00:37:17.689
Whatever. I don't care.

546
00:37:18.819 --> 00:37:20.048
I'm not a big fat liar.

547
00:37:23.919 --> 00:37:26.089
I thought he was going to get a job at a celebrity agency.

548
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:27.559
Did he get fired already?

549
00:37:44.848 --> 00:37:45.908
What?

550
00:37:53.189 --> 00:37:54.459
What's her problem?

551
00:37:55.959 --> 00:37:57.359
Gosh, I'm late.

552
00:38:04.129 --> 00:38:06.868
Something urgent came up, so I'm on my way to work now.

553
00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:08.598
You lazy punk.

554
00:38:08.798 --> 00:38:11.368
Hey, did you find out the number on that silicon?

555
00:38:11.669 --> 00:38:14.479
A professional told me that it could be restored.

556
00:38:14.479 --> 00:38:15.709
We just need to wait a little...

557
00:38:18.548 --> 00:38:20.278
My gosh, what a bad temper.

558
00:38:27.019 --> 00:38:29.158
(I know you don't believe me, you jerk!)

559
00:38:29.988 --> 00:38:31.328
"Jerk"?

560
00:38:34.399 --> 00:38:36.059
How did she get a hold of my number?

561
00:38:49.278 --> 00:38:52.149
I can't believe he's still there.

562
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:06.629
What?

563
00:39:22.879 --> 00:39:24.778
- My gosh. - He fell.

564
00:39:24.778 --> 00:39:26.178
What should we do?

565
00:39:26.178 --> 00:39:27.749
Call 911.

566
00:39:27.749 --> 00:39:30.448
- My gosh. - I can't believe this.

568
00:39:47.499 --> 00:39:49.468
Ji Dong!

569
00:39:49.999 --> 00:39:51.539
- My goodness! - Please calm down.

570
00:39:52.109 --> 00:39:53.508
Ji Dong!

571
00:39:56.178 --> 00:39:57.848
My son!

572
00:39:59.209 --> 00:40:00.809
I can't believe this!

573
00:40:01.178 --> 00:40:02.879
- Mom, stop. - My gosh!

574
00:40:02.948 --> 00:40:05.388
- Mom. - My goodness.

575
00:40:07.859 --> 00:40:09.488
I can't believe this!

576
00:40:09.488 --> 00:40:11.129
Mom, stop it.

577
00:40:16.229 --> 00:40:17.499
That person's going to die.

578
00:40:17.798 --> 00:40:19.069
I can see shadows.

579
00:40:20.499 --> 00:40:21.999
She was right.

580
00:40:22.468 --> 00:40:23.939
She can foresee death.

581
00:40:38.789 --> 00:40:40.189
He died.

582
00:40:42.689 --> 00:40:44.859
He really jumped off that bridge and died.

583
00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:47.129
I told you so.

584
00:40:47.388 --> 00:40:49.928
He was a really nice and diligent guy.

585
00:40:50.559 --> 00:40:52.828
If I had listened to you,

586
00:40:54.439 --> 00:40:55.939
I could've saved him.

587
00:40:57.468 --> 00:40:58.868
It's all my fault.

588
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:02.008
I practically killed him myself.

589
00:41:03.879 --> 00:41:06.348
My gosh, I'm so dumb!

590
00:41:06.778 --> 00:41:09.149
How am I going to reveal the truth like this?

591
00:41:13.089 --> 00:41:14.959
What? "The truth"?

592
00:41:19.789 --> 00:41:21.258
How did you endure it?

593
00:41:23.428 --> 00:41:25.468
How did you endure it?

594
00:41:26.328 --> 00:41:28.169
This was just my first time.

595
00:41:29.238 --> 00:41:31.738
But you must've lived with this feeling all your life.

596
00:41:32.269 --> 00:41:33.609
Get lost.

597
00:41:33.939 --> 00:41:36.339
Or I'm going to stick that soju bottle into your eyes.

598
00:41:39.008 --> 00:41:41.149
- No. - What do you mean?

599
00:41:41.649 --> 00:41:44.249
You're not a cursed monster.

600
00:41:46.948 --> 00:41:49.118
What you have...

601
00:41:50.359 --> 00:41:51.559
is a gift.

602
00:41:52.129 --> 00:41:53.689
It's not a curse.

603
00:41:55.158 --> 00:41:57.528
The fact that you can foresee someone's death...

604
00:41:58.229 --> 00:42:02.368
is a really cool thing because that means you can save people's lives.

605
00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:07.109
My gosh, what are you doing?

606
00:42:10.578 --> 00:42:12.048
Let's work together.

607
00:42:12.479 --> 00:42:14.348
Let's save lives.

608
00:42:14.948 --> 00:42:17.689
You should prove it to yourself that what you have...

609
00:42:17.848 --> 00:42:20.488
is actually a gift, not a curse.

610
00:42:21.419 --> 00:42:24.758
Stop running away like a fool.

611
00:42:24.888 --> 00:42:26.888
That's enough. Get lost.

612
00:42:27.798 --> 00:42:28.859
That kid who sat next to you.

613
00:42:31.499 --> 00:42:33.468
You said you can't get her out of your head.

614
00:42:36.138 --> 00:42:38.669
You felt uneasy about having left her on that plane.

615
00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:44.008
Let's save lives together...

616
00:42:44.348 --> 00:42:47.848
so that no one will have to die such a sudden death.

617
00:42:49.319 --> 00:42:50.819
Let's work together.

618
00:42:51.749 --> 00:42:52.819
Okay?

619
00:42:55.089 --> 00:42:57.189
If it's too hard on your own,

620
00:42:59.388 --> 00:43:00.758
I'll help you.

621
00:43:01.658 --> 00:43:02.658
Okay?

622
00:43:05.028 --> 00:43:06.028
Come on.

623
00:43:07.769 --> 00:43:08.899
Hey.

624
00:43:09.968 --> 00:43:11.069
Can you...

625
00:43:12.439 --> 00:43:14.138
move your feet?

626
00:43:28.718 --> 00:43:30.828
Let's work together just once.

627
00:43:30.928 --> 00:43:33.559
If you're not sure about it,

628
00:43:34.328 --> 00:43:36.158
why don't you give it a try just once?

629
00:43:36.899 --> 00:43:38.169
Just once.

630
00:43:39.899 --> 00:43:42.298
My gosh, he's so loud.

631
00:43:42.339 --> 00:43:44.939
Just do it for him already.

632
00:43:44.939 --> 00:43:48.408
My gosh, let me get some sleep. You're so loud.

633
00:43:48.408 --> 00:43:51.448
You heard what she said, right?

634
00:43:52.448 --> 00:43:54.048
Just once.

635
00:43:54.948 --> 00:43:57.019
Let's work together just once.

636
00:43:57.448 --> 00:43:59.448
Just once.

637
00:43:59.789 --> 00:44:01.019
Please?

638
00:44:01.019 --> 00:44:02.859
Just once.

639
00:44:02.859 --> 00:44:05.859
- Let's do it just once. - Let's go.

640
00:44:05.859 --> 00:44:09.158
- Gosh, we need to do it. - Get inside.

641
00:44:09.828 --> 00:44:12.269
My gosh, stop playing hard to get!

642
00:44:12.569 --> 00:44:14.238
- Let's do it just once. - Shut it.

643
00:44:14.439 --> 00:44:15.868
That crazy jerk.

644
00:44:38.488 --> 00:44:40.488
You said you can't get her out of your head.

645
00:44:43.158 --> 00:44:45.629
You felt uneasy about having left her on that plane.

646
00:44:45.769 --> 00:44:49.238
Let's save lives together so that no one will have to...

647
00:44:49.468 --> 00:44:51.008
die such a sudden death.

648
00:44:53.468 --> 00:44:55.109
Who am I going to save?

649
00:44:55.709 --> 00:44:57.778
I couldn't even save my own dad.

650
00:44:58.508 --> 00:45:00.379
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

651
00:45:01.819 --> 00:45:02.979
Moo Gang.

652
00:45:03.319 --> 00:45:04.388
You punk.

653
00:45:04.388 --> 00:45:06.888
I heard someone reported you yesterday for causing a fuss...

654
00:45:06.888 --> 00:45:08.589
in front of their house after getting drunk.

655
00:45:08.919 --> 00:45:10.019
What?

656
00:45:10.718 --> 00:45:13.789
Oh, that? No, that's not what it was.

657
00:45:14.028 --> 00:45:16.158
There was a slight misunderstanding.

658
00:45:16.298 --> 00:45:20.698
My gosh, you're a disgrace to our police station.

659
00:45:22.839 --> 00:45:25.269
What was the number on that silicon?

660
00:45:25.408 --> 00:45:29.039
Well, I figured out the hospital that bought it.

661
00:45:29.138 --> 00:45:31.249
But the doctor was busy doing a surgery,

662
00:45:31.278 --> 00:45:32.678
and they said they'll call me back after...

663
00:45:32.678 --> 00:45:34.078

Since when did detectives give people the option to call back?

665
00:45:37.519 --> 00:45:39.249
Do you think you're a realtor or something?

666

- But he was in surgery... - When is he going to call you?

667
00:45:41.758 --> 00:45:43.919
- In 1, 2, 3. - I'll go see him right now.

668
00:45:45.388 --> 00:45:48.559
My gosh, what's he doing with this brain?

669
00:45:48.928 --> 00:45:52.428
What am I going to do with him? My goodness gracious.

670
00:45:53.698 --> 00:45:54.899
What's this?

671
00:45:55.638 --> 00:45:58.468
It's the 1997 Moojin Fire Accident.

He can't even take care of a case that happened two days ago.

673
00:46:01.238 --> 00:46:03.278
Why is he looking into something that happened 20 years ago?

674
00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:18.859
It was used 20 years ago.

675
00:46:18.959 --> 00:46:21.258
I just found the patient records.

676

Let's see.

677
00:46:26.598 --> 00:46:28.868
This patient got more than just a breast implant.

678
00:46:29.238 --> 00:46:30.939
He also got her thing removed.

679
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:32.638
"Her thing"?

680
00:46:35.979 --> 00:46:38.709
Do you mean she went through a sex reassignment surgery?

681
00:46:40.048 --> 00:46:43.649
So that's why his name wasn't on the missing persons list.

682
00:46:44.388 --> 00:46:46.649
She also got cosmetic surgery on her face.

No.

689
00:47:21.988 --> 00:47:25.328
I think he was mistaken about the serial number.

No, everyone's obligated to take that photo.

It was right there.

829
01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:26.809
Like this.

830
01:00:27.368 --> 01:00:29.508
The person didn't take my advice and died like this.

831
01:00:30.778 --> 01:00:32.778
So you have to listen to me.

832
01:00:32.908 --> 01:00:35.249
Please don't go anywhere near the shopping mall.

833
01:00:35.249 --> 01:00:36.548
You're crazy.

834
01:00:36.919 --> 01:00:40.448
You wench. Do you think I have time to go to places like that?

835
01:00:40.448 --> 01:00:42.658
I don't have an easy life, okay?

836
01:00:45.758 --> 01:00:48.928
Gosh, this isn't working. All right, I'll be generous today.

837
01:00:49.098 --> 01:00:51.368
I'll give you your pay...

838
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:53.528
for today,

839
01:00:55.198 --> 01:00:57.809
so don't go anywhere. Stay right here with me.

840
01:00:59.939 --> 01:01:02.238
I put in an extra 10-dollar bill.

841
01:01:05.508 --> 01:01:06.749
You're a gold digger, aren't you?

842
01:01:06.948 --> 01:01:08.618
You little... Get lost!

843
01:01:08.948 --> 01:01:13.218
You're investing this 100 dollars to rip me off big time later on.

844
01:01:17.528 --> 01:01:20.658
You treat money like garbage.

845
01:01:22.359 --> 01:01:23.859
Whatever. I did my best.

846
01:01:23.859 --> 01:01:25.928
I don't care whether you die or not.

847
01:01:34.539 --> 01:01:37.778
Jerk, how dare you call me a gold digger?

848
01:01:37.848 --> 01:01:40.948
Hey, did you leave your eyeballs at home or what?

849
01:01:40.979 --> 01:01:44.218
And what kind of gold digger would target an old blue-collar like you?

850
01:01:44.218 --> 01:01:45.948
Have you completely lost your mind?

851
01:01:45.948 --> 01:01:48.859
Go ahead. Hit me. Punch me.

852
01:01:48.859 --> 01:01:51.729
- Hit me. I'd rather get hit. - Go away, you wench.

853
01:01:51.729 --> 01:01:54.459
- Mister, just punch me. Wait. - I said, go away. Let go.

854
01:01:54.459 --> 01:01:56.729
Help! This man is trying to run away after hitting me.

855
01:01:56.729 --> 01:01:58.428
- Let go! - No, you can't go!

856
01:01:58.428 --> 01:01:59.569
Gosh, are you insane?

857
01:02:24.959 --> 01:02:26.589
Blood... Blood.

858
01:02:26.888 --> 01:02:30.129
I'm bleeding. That man is trying to run away after hitting me.

859
01:02:30.129 --> 01:02:31.899
Please call the police! I'm bleeding.

860
01:02:32.399 --> 01:02:34.999
Look at this blood. Gosh, I'm bleeding!

861
01:02:38.209 --> 01:02:39.539
Please catch him!

862
01:02:45.209 --> 01:02:46.278
Hey!

863
01:02:46.278 --> 01:02:48.278
- Let go! - Gosh.

864
01:02:48.548 --> 01:02:49.848
Goodness.

865
01:02:49.848 --> 01:02:51.618
- Miss, what's going on? - Arrest this man.

866
01:02:51.618 --> 01:02:53.649
- You need to arrest him now. - Why? What happened?

867
01:02:53.649 --> 01:02:55.359
- Well... - Make sure he can't move.

868
01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:57.589
- What did he do? - He hit me.

869
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:59.528
- He hit you? - Yes.

870
01:02:59.828 --> 01:03:01.359
- Do something. - Wait!

871
01:03:01.359 --> 01:03:04.028
I didn't do anything! That woman is a gold digger!

872
01:03:04.028 --> 01:03:06.528
I'm telling you. She's a gold digger. Officer!

873
01:03:06.528 --> 01:03:07.539
Officer.

874
01:03:09.298 --> 01:03:10.298
Here.

875
01:03:13.209 --> 01:03:14.979
What are you doing here? You said you can't come.

876
01:03:15.809 --> 01:03:18.249
I had to come because you said you'd pull out my eyeballs.

877
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:19.508
That must hurt a lot.

878
01:03:21.118 --> 01:03:22.419
I don't want to die like that.

879
01:03:24.519 --> 01:03:27.089
Do you even know what I went through to find you?

880
01:03:28.718 --> 01:03:30.218
Give me your phone.

881
01:03:31.428 --> 01:03:32.528
Come on.

882
01:03:39.169 --> 01:03:40.629
(Han Moo Gang, added to friends list)

883
01:03:41.039 --> 01:03:42.098
What did you just do?

884
01:03:42.098 --> 01:03:44.539
I don't want to go through hoops again just to find you.

885
01:03:45.868 --> 01:03:48.008
Whatever. You're the one who didn't come when I asked you to.

886
01:03:48.778 --> 01:03:51.078
You just can't talk nicely, can you?

887
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:54.678
Great, it's done. Here you go.

888
01:03:58.919 --> 01:04:00.348
You hurt yourself, didn't you?

889
01:04:01.089 --> 01:04:03.959
To get him locked up in a holding cell to make sure he's safe.

890
01:04:04.629 --> 01:04:05.729
Aren't I right?

891
01:04:10.459 --> 01:04:13.598
Well, are you really a detective?

892
01:04:13.798 --> 01:04:16.468
You tripped and fell because you can't even walk properly.

893
01:04:16.698 --> 01:04:18.269
You should just quit being a detective.

894
01:04:21.709 --> 01:04:24.109
I'm actually planning to quit.

895
01:04:26.979 --> 01:04:28.048
Well...

896
01:04:28.678 --> 01:04:30.778
Well, you know. Everyone can...

897
01:04:30.778 --> 01:04:33.419
trip and fall at times.

898
01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:35.618
Getting your back stepped on happens too.

899
01:04:35.618 --> 01:04:37.629
You're done, right? I'll get going, then.

900
01:04:38.189 --> 01:04:40.428
Wait, no. You can't leave.

901
01:04:48.698 --> 01:04:50.269
Well, what else do you need?

902
01:04:51.039 --> 01:04:53.138
I don't think it'll end with that man.

903
01:04:54.479 --> 01:04:55.508
Sorry?

904
01:04:57.479 --> 01:04:58.678
Well,

905
01:04:59.609 --> 01:05:02.778
I touched that man's shadow earlier.

906
01:05:14.528 --> 01:05:16.598
Help me!

907
01:05:16.999 --> 01:05:20.198
I'll kill this jerk!

908
01:05:21.868 --> 01:05:23.738
Please come back to me.

909
01:05:25.669 --> 01:05:26.968
Let go!

910
01:05:27.638 --> 01:05:31.709
I'll really kill you, jerk.

911
01:05:44.428 --> 01:05:46.589
There will be a hostage situation?

912
01:05:49.499 --> 01:05:50.658
I think...

913
01:05:51.899 --> 01:05:53.499
it was a shopping mall.

914
01:05:56.698 --> 01:05:59.609
I saw an underwear store.

915
01:06:00.709 --> 01:06:04.109
A gun. That's right, I think he was holding a gun.

916
01:06:06.749 --> 01:06:09.749
I think it was 7pm.

917
01:06:11.149 --> 01:06:12.519
He was wearing a military uniform.

918
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:13.988
A military uniform?

919
01:06:20.359 --> 01:06:22.999
If he had a firearm on him, he must be a runaway soldier.

920
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:27.229
There's no news about a runaway soldier though.

921
01:06:28.569 --> 01:06:29.999
Do you happen to know the date?

922
01:06:30.269 --> 01:06:31.669
I'm not sure about that.

923
01:06:34.008 --> 01:06:37.039
But if he's a runaway soldier, it means that anyone...

924
01:06:37.039 --> 01:06:39.249
can be held hostage even though that man is safe.

925
01:06:39.548 --> 01:06:40.709
Right.

926
01:06:42.019 --> 01:06:45.388
We have to catch the runaway soldier to prevent that situation.

927
01:06:47.348 --> 01:06:49.658
Do you know which shopping mall it was?

928
01:06:49.658 --> 01:06:50.928
Try to remember what you saw.

929
01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:52.388
Well...

930
01:06:58.269 --> 01:07:00.328
I remember seeing a big clock on a wall.

931
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:04.098
Wait.

932
01:07:05.069 --> 01:07:06.169
What is it?

933
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:08.278
It was 7 o'clock according to the soldier's watch,

934
01:07:08.439 --> 01:07:10.408
but the clock was pointing at 9 o'clock.

935
01:07:10.408 --> 01:07:12.678
7 o'clock... But...

936
01:07:13.979 --> 01:07:16.548
But the clock on the wall was pointing at 9 o'clock?

937
01:07:18.519 --> 01:07:19.819
A clock on a wall?

938
01:07:24.189 --> 01:07:25.859
I think I know where it is.

939
01:07:30.385 --> 01:07:32.154
What? It's a painting?

940
01:07:32.484 --> 01:07:33.555
Is this it?

941
01:07:35.255 --> 01:07:38.165
That means the incident will take place at this shopping mall at 7pm.

942
01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:39.465
We don't know the date though.

943
01:07:39.465 --> 01:07:42.494
Exactly. We need to know the date.

944

(Mentoring Lecture, Senator Nam Joong Pyo)

945
01:07:45.564 --> 01:07:47.265
- It's today. - What?

946
01:07:48.034 --> 01:07:51.774
Look at that. I saw people holding that book.

947
01:07:55.015 --> 01:07:56.915
That means we only have five hours.

948
01:07:58.144 --> 01:07:59.215
What?

949
01:08:03.284 --> 01:08:04.385
What's wrong?

950
01:08:04.385 --> 01:08:05.784
That woman.

951
01:08:05.784 --> 01:08:08.795
She was crying among the bystanders.

952
01:08:08.795 --> 01:08:10.625
She must know something.

953
01:08:16.765 --> 01:08:17.965
(Meet me now, or I'll kill everyone.)

954
01:08:18.465 --> 01:08:20.635
I told him that I'm seeing someone else now...

955
01:08:20.975 --> 01:08:23.505
and that I want him to stop clinging to me.

956
01:08:24.345 --> 01:08:26.904
Yes, got it.

957
01:08:27.574 --> 01:08:28.644
Okay.

958
01:08:34.015 --> 01:08:36.455
Our guess was right. He ran away early this morning.

959
01:08:39.085 --> 01:08:40.955
Why isn't it on the news though?

960
01:08:42.225 --> 01:08:44.694
A number of sexual assault cases happened in the military, you know.

961
01:08:44.765 --> 01:08:47.394
They're probably hushing it up and trying to track him down.

962
01:08:48.595 --> 01:08:49.665
Miss,

963
01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:52.104
please try to contact your boyfriend.

964
01:08:52.104 --> 01:08:53.335
Tell him that you want to talk.

965
01:09:31.904 --> 01:09:33.744
And you know what?

966
01:09:33.744 --> 01:09:35.744
Your boyfriend must've been having a hard time in the military.

967
01:09:35.744 --> 01:09:38.045
How can you cheat on him like that?

968
01:09:38.444 --> 01:09:40.345
I would be furious too.

969
01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:48.095
Have you been starving yourself or what?

970
01:09:49.324 --> 01:09:50.354
Look at this.

971
01:09:50.765 --> 01:09:52.824
You've had two servings already.

972

Hey, I'm here.

Hello.

974
01:10:15.614 --> 01:10:17.215
Has everything been well with you?

975
01:10:17.555 --> 01:10:18.625
Yes.

976
01:10:19.524 --> 01:10:20.795
How have you been?

977
01:10:21.095 --> 01:10:22.125
Good.

978
01:10:24.494 --> 01:10:27.894
You said that you're seeing another guy.

979
01:10:28.064 --> 01:10:29.494
It was a lie, right?

980
01:10:29.494 --> 01:10:31.734
Excuse me. May I know what time is it?

981
01:10:32.465 --> 01:10:33.505
Sorry.

982
01:10:36.534 --> 01:10:38.644
Gosh, what are you doing now?

983
01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:42.314
I'm sorry. My apologies.

984
01:10:48.354 --> 01:10:51.184
You were lying when you said that you're seeing someone else, right?

985
01:10:54.295 --> 01:10:55.654
I'm sorry.

986
01:10:56.354 --> 01:10:58.965
Why are you apologizing? Did you...

987
01:11:00.765 --> 01:11:02.295
What? What are you doing now?

988
01:11:03.165 --> 01:11:05.835
Well, I totally understand how you must be feeling now,

989
01:11:05.904 --> 01:11:08.034
- but this is wrong. Let's go. - What?

990
01:11:08.234 --> 01:11:09.234
Hey.

991
01:11:09.234 --> 01:11:11.644
- I'm really sorry. - Hey, how could you...

992
01:11:12.604 --> 01:11:14.715
How could you do this to me?

993
01:11:18.184 --> 01:11:19.915
Cheer up, okay?

994
01:11:20.684 --> 01:11:22.585
There are so many women in this world.

995
01:11:22.585 --> 01:11:25.225
Just forget about her and move on. There.

996
01:11:26.725 --> 01:11:29.354
Go on in. Everything will be okay.

997
01:11:33.194 --> 01:11:34.394
Oh, boy.

998
01:11:40.404 --> 01:11:42.675
Gosh, that little...

999
01:11:50.614 --> 01:11:54.154
People from his division said that they'll pick him up.

1000
01:11:55.085 --> 01:11:56.385
It's all over now.

1001
01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:58.385
I'm off.

1002
01:12:04.765 --> 01:12:05.965
Detective Han!

1003
01:12:08.795 --> 01:12:11.805
I know I told you to quit your job, but I take it back.

1004
01:12:12.335 --> 01:12:14.635
You were pretty helpful today.

1005
01:12:14.875 --> 01:12:17.135
All right. Bye.

1006
01:12:19.805 --> 01:12:20.814
Ha Ram!

1007
01:12:22.574 --> 01:12:25.415
We did an incredible thing today.

1008
01:12:25.744 --> 01:12:26.944
You know that, right?

1009
01:12:28.684 --> 01:12:30.824
That ability you have...

1010
01:12:31.284 --> 01:12:34.994
is a blessing, not a curse. I hope you know that now.

1011
01:12:40.194 --> 01:12:41.265
Bye now.

1012
01:12:51.944 --> 01:12:54.175
(Sunglasses)

1013
01:12:54.175 --> 01:12:55.175
(Save)

1014
01:12:58.644 --> 01:13:00.045
(Sorry, Moo Gang. It's my fault.)

1015
01:13:18.665 --> 01:13:21.404
We did an incredible thing today.

1016
01:13:22.205 --> 01:13:24.175
That ability you have...

1017
01:13:24.805 --> 01:13:28.475
is a blessing, not a curse. I hope you know that now.

1018
01:13:30.784 --> 01:13:33.114
It's been decided that the commemoration park...

1019
01:13:33.114 --> 01:13:36.684
for the Moojin Time Mart collapse from 20 years ago that killed...

1020
01:13:36.684 --> 01:13:39.184
300 people will be built on a mountain...

1021
01:13:39.184 --> 01:13:41.994
near Moojin Elementary School after a long conflict.

1022
01:13:41.994 --> 01:13:43.194
The construction will commence...

1023
01:13:43.194 --> 01:13:45.324
- as early as next week. - What? My elementary school?

1024
01:13:45.324 --> 01:13:46.524
- Since the location has been... - Gosh!

1025
01:13:46.524 --> 01:13:49.494
Joon and I buried our time capsules in that mountain.

1026
01:13:49.494 --> 01:13:53.305
- Royal Group... - Gosh, I should dig it up tomorrow.

1027
01:13:53.305 --> 01:13:55.904
All eyes are on how the situation will unfold.

1028
01:13:55.904 --> 01:13:57.644
My goodness.

1029
01:13:57.644 --> 01:14:00.175
My body is aching all over from doing all that work.

1030
01:14:00.404 --> 01:14:03.215
Shall I go to a sauna and get a body scrub?

1031
01:14:05.484 --> 01:14:06.545
Oh, the bus is here.

1032
01:14:15.354 --> 01:14:16.494
It's my phone.

1033
01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:18.665
Please answer it for me.

1034
01:14:22.234 --> 01:14:23.295
Hello?

1035
01:14:25.034 --> 01:14:27.305
Yes. Just a moment, please.

1036
01:14:44.984 --> 01:14:47.795
What was that? Was I imagining it or something?

1037
01:14:55.064 --> 01:14:56.194
What just happened?

1038
01:14:56.864 --> 01:14:58.165
That's so weird.

1039
01:15:00.635 --> 01:15:02.774
(Loser, 17 missing calls)

1040
01:15:03.404 --> 01:15:04.444
What?

1041
01:15:11.684 --> 01:15:13.144
Did something happen?

1042
01:15:16.755 --> 01:15:18.854
Did they get released?

1043
01:15:30.878 --> 01:15:34.110
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E01 Black "It's Not a Curse"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

1044
01:15:44.829 --> 01:15:48.100
What's going on? He called me so many times.

1045
01:16:16.269 --> 01:16:18.798
I put it around my toes and braided it all night to finish it.

1046
01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:23.979
My dad says a red thread is the thread of fate.

1047
01:16:24.939 --> 01:16:25.939
Really?

1048
01:16:26.979 --> 01:16:28.279
Oh, wait here.

1049
01:16:36.519 --> 01:16:38.888
What? Are you giving it to me?

1050
01:16:39.119 --> 01:16:41.088
But you like it so much.

1051
01:16:41.088 --> 01:16:44.328
That's why I'm giving it to you. Please keep it for me.

1052
01:16:44.428 --> 01:16:45.699
Can I write you?

1053
01:16:49.869 --> 01:16:51.168
(19-1, Myeonhee-dong, Mioh-gu, Seoul)

1054
01:16:53.199 --> 01:16:55.239
Ha Ram, what do I always say?

1055
01:16:55.309 --> 01:16:57.439
"You're a blessed girl."

1056
01:16:57.638 --> 01:17:00.609
That's right. The ability you have is a blessing.

1057
01:17:01.479 --> 01:17:03.349
Foreseeing deaths is...

1058
01:17:03.649 --> 01:17:06.279
a great ability that you can save people's lives with.

1059
01:17:06.678 --> 01:17:09.088
I'll write you often.

1060
01:17:09.319 --> 01:17:11.758
Reply me. Don't forget me.

1061
01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:13.588
Stay in touch, okay?

1062
01:17:15.588 --> 01:17:17.189
Is this loser...

1063
01:17:18.128 --> 01:17:19.559
really him?

1064
01:17:22.668 --> 01:17:23.928
Actually,

1065
01:17:24.468 --> 01:17:26.569
his lips and eyes look similar.

1066
01:17:26.668 --> 01:17:27.708
I'm going to...

1067
01:17:28.409 --> 01:17:29.809
become a detective.

1068
01:17:31.078 --> 01:17:33.178
A cool detective like your dad.

1069
01:17:38.019 --> 01:17:40.019
He really became a detective.

1070
01:17:40.918 --> 01:17:43.689
Gosh, why didn't I recognize him?

1071
01:17:44.689 --> 01:17:45.788
He's...

1072
01:18:01.739 --> 01:18:03.668
(Republic of Korea Army)

1073
01:18:03.838 --> 01:18:05.279
Why is there only one line?

1074
01:18:06.479 --> 01:18:08.248
There were clearly two.

1075
01:18:09.008 --> 01:18:10.109
The watch.

1076
01:18:11.619 --> 01:18:13.519
He was wearing a watch on his right wrist.

1077
01:18:16.418 --> 01:18:18.958
Excuse me. Where is the gun?

1078
01:18:19.859 --> 01:18:21.689
He didn't have one on him when he deserted.

1079
01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:23.588
Let's go.

1080
01:18:26.828 --> 01:18:27.899
What?

1081
01:18:28.828 --> 01:18:30.199
He's not the one.

1082
01:18:34.269 --> 01:18:37.008
- Hello? A hostage situation? - Hello? Yes.

1083
01:18:37.378 --> 01:18:38.909
What are you doing? Move it!

1084
01:18:40.578 --> 01:18:41.979
Move it.

1085
01:18:41.979 --> 01:18:45.819
We have breaking news. There is a hostage situation at a mall.

1086
01:18:45.918 --> 01:18:48.519
The captor is in a military uniform, and he has a gun.

1087
01:18:48.519 --> 01:18:50.388
It's highly likely that he's a soldier who deserted.

1088
01:18:50.489 --> 01:18:53.119
The hostage is a man in his 30s.

1089
01:18:53.119 --> 01:18:55.489
His identity remains unknown.

1090
01:18:55.489 --> 01:18:56.859
Why is he...

1091
01:18:57.798 --> 01:18:59.628
Why is Detective Han there?

1092
01:18:59.928 --> 01:19:01.128
Why...

1093
01:19:01.998 --> 01:19:03.828
Why is Detective Han there?

1094
01:19:04.399 --> 01:19:06.638
- Why is he there? - Chief!

1095
01:19:06.638 --> 01:19:08.769
Detective Han is the hostage. Come and look.

1096
01:19:08.769 --> 01:19:09.769
What's going on?

1097
01:19:10.008 --> 01:19:11.279
That's Detective Han, right?

1098
01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:12.638
(The captor is a soldier, the victim of sexual assault.)

1099
01:19:12.638 --> 01:19:14.349
He went to pick up my mom!

1100
01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:16.508
It is said that Private Lee is not a deserter.

1101
01:19:17.208 --> 01:19:18.449
Your mom?

1102
01:19:18.519 --> 01:19:20.078
Please let me go.

1103
01:19:20.078 --> 01:19:22.388
My mom has dementia.

1104
01:19:22.418 --> 01:19:24.588
She's at a mall in Dongbaek-ri. Its name is Nine something.

1105
01:19:24.588 --> 01:19:27.388
Anyway, they have her there.

1106
01:19:27.859 --> 01:19:29.989
I have to go pick her up.

1107
01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:32.428
You mean Nine PM?

1108
01:19:33.428 --> 01:19:35.369
Is that why this man was there?

1109
01:19:36.128 --> 01:19:37.899
Where in Nine PM are you at?

1110
01:19:38.269 --> 01:19:40.099
Does this mean that man's fate...

1111
01:19:41.008 --> 01:19:42.508
became Detective Han's?

1112
01:19:43.239 --> 01:19:46.508
I'm really going to kill this guy!

1113
01:19:46.779 --> 01:19:48.809
He went to the mall today...

1114
01:19:48.809 --> 01:19:51.378
No. It can't be.

1115
01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:55.888
When he was stopped by the guards, he took the man hostage.

1116
01:19:56.048 --> 01:19:58.559
(The captor requests Senator Nam Joong Pyo to reveal the truth.)

1117
01:19:58.559 --> 01:20:00.019
What? What happened?

1118
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:03.189
- Did Detective Han get shot? - Let's move now.

1119
01:20:18.479 --> 01:20:19.479
What did I...

1120
01:20:20.508 --> 01:20:22.508
What did I do?

1121
01:20:22.748 --> 01:20:24.619
What on earth did I do?

1122
01:20:26.849 --> 01:20:28.349
It's because of me.

1123
01:20:45.498 --> 01:20:47.269
Doctor, please see this patient first.

1124
01:20:56.378 --> 01:20:57.378
Moo Gang.

1125
01:21:04.718 --> 01:21:06.359
Get the defibrillator ready.

1126
01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:09.788
Scissors!

1127
01:21:11.729 --> 01:21:13.729
Clear. Shock!

1128
01:21:16.668 --> 01:21:18.338
Charge it again to 200 joules. Hurry.

1129
01:21:20.708 --> 01:21:22.769
Clear. Shock!

1130
01:21:59.538 --> 01:22:01.979
It has been revealed that the person the gun belonged to was...

1131
01:22:01.979 --> 01:22:05.578
not Private Lee, but Detective Han Moo Gang, the hostage.

1132
01:22:05.649 --> 01:22:07.418
Detective Han was taken to the hospital...

1133
01:22:07.418 --> 01:22:08.918
I killed him.

1134
01:22:09.788 --> 01:22:11.519
I killed him. I did it.

1135
01:22:12.019 --> 01:22:13.819
I'm cursed.

1136
01:22:20.029 --> 01:22:21.298
I should die.

1137
01:22:21.529 --> 01:22:22.998
I should die.

1138
01:22:23.369 --> 01:22:24.699
I should die.

1139
01:23:41.979 --> 01:23:43.248
What?

1140
01:24:10.309 --> 01:24:12.078
How dramatic.

1141
01:24:13.078 --> 01:24:15.109
Gosh, humans.

1142
01:24:33.968 --> 01:24:35.399
(Black)

1143
01:24:35.828 --> 01:24:38.099
It will be a tragic end.

1144
01:24:39.099 --> 01:24:41.769
First love, my foot. I don't need it.

1145
01:24:42.708 --> 01:24:44.008
Hey, you!

1146
01:24:45.078 --> 01:24:48.008
- Hey! - How can I lose this woman?

1147
01:24:48.078 --> 01:24:50.279
She's so annoying.

1148
01:24:50.409 --> 01:24:53.449
What's wrong with Moo Gang? He's like a completely different person.

1149
01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:55.519
Who are you?

1150
01:24:56.449 --> 01:24:58.689
You died that day, Han Moo Gang.
