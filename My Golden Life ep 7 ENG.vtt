(Episode 7)

4
00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.029
Stop right there.

5
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:41.750
What are you doing in my house?

6
00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.110
"My house"?

7
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.920
How did you find my house?

8
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.689
I knew there was something strange about you.

9
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.220
I knew it when you insisted to pay me back.

10
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.390
I noticed when you talked about N-Gaon.

11
00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.199
How dare you come to my house when I'm not home?

12
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.400
Did you take a picture of yourself giving me money?

13
00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.240
Never, ever! You'll never see me again.

14
00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.009
I'm so sick of dealing with you.

15
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.309
You two knew each other?

16
00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.279
General Manager Min.

17
00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.779
I thought you went to pick up Eun Seok.

18
00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.419
Eun Seok?

19
00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:30.359
She's Eun Seok?

20
00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.300
Yes.

21
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.029
Oh, my goodness.

22
00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.839
I... I...

23
00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.509
I can never make that much money.

24
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.809
Are you going to take only 5,000 dollars?

25
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.850
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

26
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.609
You lowered yourself when it was 20,000 dollars,

27
00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.119
but now that it's 5,000 dollars, you act proud.

28
00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.249
You're so hopeless.

29
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.619
Are you a beggar?

30
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.059
Your humble self is back...

31
00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:01.259
now that the debt is back down to 5,000.

32
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.990
I'll pay back 5,000 dollars.

33
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.499
Stop putting on a show...

34
00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.199
if you won't pay the full 20,700 dollars.

35
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.200
Could you lend me 20,000 dollars?

36
00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.980
But how do you two know each other?

37
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.039
Why isn't she coming in, General Manager Min?

38
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.580
The vice-chairman is here.

39
00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.779
Don't let my parents know.

40
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.689
- Why is everyone outside? - Father.

41
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.789
You're here, Eun Seok.

42
00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.230
Good to see you. It's good to see you.

43
00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.640
What brings you this far, Vice Chairman Choi?

44
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.469
I saw her belongings at the door but not her.

45
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.110
Let's go in.

46
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.610
Let's go.

47
00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:53.839
Yes.

48
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.680
Why are your hands empty, Do Kyung?

49
00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.020
I thought you were buying the cake.

50
00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:07.020
Oh, it's in the car. Go in first.

51
00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:08.730
Okay.

52
00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.069
What's wrong? Do you remember something?

53
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.939
Do you remember anything?

54
00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.439
Pardon?

55
00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.650
You might remember.

56
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.279
We've been living here even before you were born.

57
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.219
We kept your room, but Mother just renovated it.

58
00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.189
- I see. - Let's go.

59
00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.159
Yes.

60
00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.999
Is that how you accept an apology?

61
00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.409
Because I don't want your apology.

62
00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.069
I bet something urgent came up.

63
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.909
When something urgent happens to you,

64
00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.379
can I not be mad of whatever happens to me?

65
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.480
"Someone like me?" What kind of person am I?

66
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.950
You trampled over me.

67
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.689
How can you say you did it out of noblesse oblige?

68
00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.020
You weren't doing me a favor.

69
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.789
You're taking credit with your parents' money.

70
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.159
That was pathetic.

71
00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:17.390
Don't be so rude.

72
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.900
Do I still look like a beggar to you?

73
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.130
Think why I brought you 20,000 dollars...

74
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.500
as you count these bills.

75
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.539
This is insane.

76
00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.239
This is horrible.

77
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.479
She's here.

78
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.179
What was she doing outside?

79
00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.950
She met Do Kyung in front of the house.

80
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.690
Eun Seok.

81
00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.070
Nice... Nice to see you too.

82
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.140
Don't say that. I'm your mom.

83
00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.109
What else should she say?

84
00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:05.880
That's true.

85
00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:08.450
Come. Have a seat.

86
00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:09.849
Yes.

87
00:05:13.873 --> 00:05:18.873
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

88
00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.060
Take it to the kitchen.

89
00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:27.599
I'm home.

90
00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:29.400
Yes. Have a seat.

91
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.870
Let's introduce each other.

92
00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:36.969
You already know about us.

93
00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:40.210
So Seo Hyun and Do Kyung should... Well...

94
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.109
Introduce yourselves.

95
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.909
I'm Choi Seo Hyun.

96
00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.880
I'm 23 and in my last year at a music college.

97
00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:48.719
My major is the cello.

98
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.760
Nice to meet you. I'm Seo Ji...

99
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.089
I'm Choi Do Kyung.

100
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.789
I'm the manager of our Strategic Planning Team.

101
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.330
- What? - Why would you...

102
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.500
talk so formally to your younger sister?

103
00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.609
Right.

104
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.779
My name is Choi Do Kyung. No.

105
00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:14.279
I'm Choi Do Kyung.

106
00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.150
Welcome back.

107
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.820
Why do you treat her like an outsider?

108
00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:23.820
Seo Hyun may not remember her, but you do.

109
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.919
I barely remember her, Mother.

110
00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.560
And it was so long ago.

111
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.390
Those memories...

112
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.429
don't match with her.

113
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.599
Do you remember about your grandfather?

114
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.310
Yes. I heard he spends most of his time...

115
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.210
in Hawaii due to his lung problems.

116
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.779
Is that what the rumors say?

117
00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:49.510
That's true.

118
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.179
His lungs just don't function well.

119
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.450
If it leaks to the public, it'll affect the business.

120
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.120
Who spoke about that?

121
00:06:59.359 --> 00:07:02.060
Ji An, this is for you.

122
00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:05.260
I thought you'd find your room unfamiliar,

123
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.229
so I got scented candles and perfume to relax you.

124
00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:10.330
I didn't know what you would prefer,

125
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.770
so I just bought what seemed fit.

126
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.770
Please understand that.

127
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.440
Oh, thank you.

128
00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:18.279
I'm sure Do Kyung got you something too.

129
00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:19.679
Pardon?

130
00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.049
Oh, the cake?

131
00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:24.479
It's in the kitchen so it won't go bad...

132
00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.150
He got her a basket of flowers.

133
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.060
You have a good sense.

134
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.560
Open it.

135
00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:51.479
How did you get this, Do Kyung?

136
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.150
Put this on her yourself, Do Kyung.

137
00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:56.880
- Me? - It's fine.

138
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.750
It's better that way since it's from you.

139
00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:03.520
She wouldn't feel comfortable about that.

140
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.419
I'll give it to her later.

141
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.229
Did you prepare anything?

142
00:08:17.469 --> 00:08:19.039
I bought this for your university admission...

143
00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:21.409
when you became 20.

144
00:08:23.609 --> 00:08:25.710
Do Kyung and Seo Hyun have one too.

145
00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:28.049
Is it a fountain pen, Father?

146
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.250
Why don't you open it?

147
00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.829
Congratulations on getting your real name back,

148
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:42.860
my dear daughter.

149
00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:47.360
Thank you. I'll use this well.

150
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.449
I didn't know your taste,

151
00:09:04.449 --> 00:09:05.980
so I decorated it to my liking.

152
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.120
Do you like it?

153
00:09:07.419 --> 00:09:10.220
Yes, the room looks so great.

154
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.090
Thank you.

155
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.090
My pleasure.

156
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.270
Don't thank the helpers like that.

157
00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:26.569
Pardon?

158
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.270
They are paid handsomely.

159
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.770
They're just doing their jobs.

160
00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:33.309
Thank people when they help you.

161
00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:36.209
"Well done" would do for situations like this.

162
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.449
Oh, I see.

163
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.880
Rest for a bit.

164
00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.289
I'll call you when lunch is ready.

165
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.590
Okay.

166
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.569
What do I do?

167
00:09:57.569 --> 00:09:58.770
Why is he...

168
00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:02.039
Why is he my brother?

169
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.049
Why is she...

170
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.880
How can this happen?

171
00:10:11.049 --> 00:10:13.120
Goodness, this is bad.

172
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:15.020
Mr. Choi.

173
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.720
- Is it lunchtime already? - No.

174
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.789
I was just worried.

175
00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:25.829
- You're worried? - What's going on?

176
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.600
How do you know Ms. Choi Eun Seok?

177
00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:32.000
I don't know the exact story.

178
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.140
But consider that your sister has suffered...

179
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.970
a great deal throughout her life.

180
00:10:36.409 --> 00:10:39.510
I hope you can be considerate of her.

181
00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:44.350
What do you mean by that?

182
00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:47.449
Are you saying that I might despise my sister...

183
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:49.289
because of some troubles from the past?

184
00:10:49.289 --> 00:10:52.860
I've never seen you get that furious before.

185
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.059
General Manager Min.

186
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.829
Remember whom you're talking to.

187
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:58.929
- Yes. - Whatever happened,

188
00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:00.970
even if she was an enemy whom I wanted dead,

189
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.630
it was before I knew that she was my sister.

190
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.270
Is it my fault that's how she grew up?

191
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.299
No, it's not.

192
00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:08.939
It's because of the kidnappers and my mom.

193
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.840
Eun Seok is nothing but a victim.

194
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.510
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:17.010
I have been worried for nothing.

196
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.049
That tends to happen when people grow old.

197
00:11:19.049 --> 00:11:21.449
They start to worry about pointless things.

198
00:11:22.689 --> 00:11:25.220
I do understand why you'd be worried.

199
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.959
Yes, some things did happen between us.

200
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.360
Yes, it's true.

201
00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:31.529
But it's none of your business.

202
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.699
My parents don't need to know either, right?

203
00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:42.439
I understand. I saw nothing.

204
00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:49.880
Jerk.

205
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:52.120
I practically raised you.

206
00:11:54.789 --> 00:11:58.090
That's right. I'm right.

207
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.059
This isn't Eun Seok's fault.

208
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.860
Is it her fault that...

209
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.090
she turned out to be disobedient, rude,

210
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.299
and haughty?

211
00:12:05.299 --> 00:12:07.529
No, it's not. Of course it's not.

212
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.299
It seemed like she had a big ego.

213
00:12:13.539 --> 00:12:15.069
If she was raised in our family,

214
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:17.640
she would have become quite arrogant.

215
00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:21.980
Must I walk for two hours in the rain?

216
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.279
Is that what I am?

217
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.350
Ji An.

218
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.520
Hyuk.

219
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.890
She behaved like that...

220
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.500
because of that guy.

221
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.130
All right. I, Choi Do Kyung,

222
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.970
will accept you as my sister.

223
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.010
Who is it?

224
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.650
It's your brother.

225
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.010
My brother?

226
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.299
Can I come in?

227
00:13:11.699 --> 00:13:12.829
I have something to tell you.

228
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.970
Do you like your room?

229
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.510
Yes.

230
00:13:23.409 --> 00:13:27.179
Don't you think this is quite a funny reunion?

231
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.709
You must have felt awkward as well.

232
00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:32.179
I did.

233
00:13:32.179 --> 00:13:34.250
Let's forget about how we met again...

234
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.090
and what happened in our past.

235
00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:37.760
We were brother and sister,

236
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.289
and it happened because we didn't know each other.

237
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.329
With that in mind, can I introduce myself again?

238
00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:46.959
It's nice to meet you.

239
00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:50.270
I'm Choi Do Kyung, your older brother.

240
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.069
I'll be your older brother.

241
00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.679
We already introduced ourselves earlier.

242
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.209
I'm sorry about what happened before.

243
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.779
Won't you shake my hand?

244
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.090
Are you making fun of me now?

245
00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:09.620
Making fun of you?

246
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.990
Why would I?

247
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.689
You're my sister whom I got back after 25 years.

248
00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:17.329
These are the facts.

249
00:14:17.659 --> 00:14:20.230
You're Choi Eun Seok, my sister who went missing.

250
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.699
And I'm your older brother, Choi Do Kyung.

251
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.740
Can we change these facts?

252
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.400
No.

253
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.909
Since we can't, I will embrace your past...

254
00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:30.169
and accept you.

255
00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.039
It's just that I'm quite flustered right now.

256
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.449
I don't know what to say in this situation.

257
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.279
And it's awkward too.

258
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.620
Take out your phone.

259
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.959
- Why? - You blocked my number.

260
00:14:46.289 --> 00:14:48.990
Let's take our first step by unblocking my number.

261
00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:58.799
Shouldn't we take Dad to the hospital?

262
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.409
Dad firmly refused going to the hospital.

263
00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:02.909
He said a little bit of rest will do.

264
00:15:02.909 --> 00:15:04.779
It's just that he's so quiet.

265
00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:06.779
He just ran a bit.

266
00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:08.709
He wouldn't pass out from running a bit.

267
00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:11.049
It's because he could neither sleep nor eat.

268
00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:12.419
Trust me. I know.

269
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:14.449
But Mom.

270
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.490
Why did Dad come back?

271
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:19.289
I thought he went back after seeing Ji An.

272
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.760
Didn't he come to send her off?

273
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.890
To say goodbye?

274
00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:25.159
I don't think that's why he came back.

275
00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:27.159
He ran to stop Ji An from leaving.

276
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:29.100
That's right.

277
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.169
He was found lying on the street.

278
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.439
I don't understand him.

279
00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:35.709
I don't think he had to stop Ji An.

280
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.709
It's only fair for him to let her go...

281
00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:39.939
if he cares about her.

282
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.709
That's right.

283
00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:44.010
I'm sad, but we ought to let her go.

284
00:15:44.419 --> 00:15:46.819
There are some things you can't understand.

285
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.990
Don't bother him. Let him get some sleep.

286
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.390
Ji Tae, I thought you had a seminar at work.

287
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.520
And Ji Ho, go to the academy and study.

288
00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:56.659
I'll go when Dad wakes up.

289
00:15:57.429 --> 00:15:58.529
Dad!

290
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.459
Mom. Where's Dad?

291
00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.669
Ji Soo. Why are you here?

292
00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:04.400
Ji Soo called me.

293
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.400
So I told her that Dad passed out.

294
00:16:06.569 --> 00:16:09.069
Why would you tell her such a thing?

295
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.720
Dad.

296
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.990
I'll take good care of you.

297
00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:24.459
I'll take care of you in place of Ji An.

298
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.590
I'm your real daughter.

299
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.059
I'm your biological daughter.

300
00:16:31.029 --> 00:16:32.929
Dad wanted to get some rest.

301
00:16:32.929 --> 00:16:34.270
He told us not to wake him up.

302
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.270
Did he?

303
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:37.529
- Come out. - Okay.

304
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.610
Is Dad really sleeping?

305
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.279
Isn't he sick?

306
00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:48.980
Why did he pass out on the streets?

307
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.150
Is it anemia?

308
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.779
Ji Tae, take Ji Soo out with you.

309
00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.250
Let's go. We'll talk on the way.

310
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.520
Are you a faucet?

311
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.090
I'm going to kill Seo Ji An.

312
00:17:03.459 --> 00:17:05.699
He ran after her, but she just left.

313
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.130
It was the car that was leaving.

314
00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:09.330
How could he stop a car?

315
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.040
Exactly. She shouldn't have gone to begin with.

316
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.540
I even told her I wouldn't be her sister.

317
00:17:18.239 --> 00:17:19.939
You can't understand Ji An?

318
00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:22.679
No, I can't. I just can't understand her.

319
00:17:23.249 --> 00:17:25.679
Why not? She'll give you a bigger allowance now.

320
00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:27.419
Ji Tae!

321
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.890
(Soo A)

322
00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:33.989
I'm too busy to talk right now.

323
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.560
I'll call you back later.

324
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.159
Hold on. Wait.

325
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.900
Listen to me.

326
00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:41.499
- I'm on my way... - I said I'll call later.

327
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.850
You're unbelievable, Ji Tae.

328
00:18:11.459 --> 00:18:12.659
I want to go.

329
00:18:13.699 --> 00:18:14.870
I don't understand him.

330
00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:16.699
It's only fair for him to let her go...

331
00:18:16.699 --> 00:18:18.100
if he cares about her.

(Franchisee Yang Mi Jung)

337
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.989
What is all this?

338
00:19:16.929 --> 00:19:18.259
There are so many.

339
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.429
Since this is our first dinner in 25 years,

340
00:19:22.429 --> 00:19:23.969
Mom prepared something special.

341
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.699
This isn't what we do every day. Don't worry.

342
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.439
Okay.

343
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:31.780
All right. Shall we begin our welcome-home dinner...

344
00:19:31.939 --> 00:19:33.209
for Eun Seok?

345
00:19:46.489 --> 00:19:48.959
Let's make a toast to Eun Seok.

346
00:19:51.459 --> 00:19:53.999
Eun Seok, that's water. Raise the other glass.

347
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.100
Oh, okay.

348
00:19:57.999 --> 00:19:59.269
Welcome home.

349
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.070
Thank you.

350
00:20:10.479 --> 00:20:13.719
Our cook used to work at the Blue House.

351
00:20:14.219 --> 00:20:15.650
He's very good.

352
00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:17.790
I should start by using the outer one, right?

353
00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:26.560
The meat is a little tough today.

354
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.900
I don't think Eun Seok would like it well-done.

355
00:20:31.199 --> 00:20:33.169
No, it's very delicious.

356
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:35.669
You can answer slowly when you eat.

357
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:37.370
You shouldn't talk with your mouth full.

358
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.979
And when you use the cutlery...

359
00:20:38.979 --> 00:20:41.610
Let's take things slow. This is her first day.

360
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.679
Mom told me to help her, so I was just being nice.

361
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.749
You should get along with her first.

362
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.290
If there's anything you want to know, ask her.

363
00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:56.330
I don't know anything about her yet.

364
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.229
Her school, major, and past.

365
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.969
Can I ask her things like that?

366
00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.400
Not here.

367
00:21:03.499 --> 00:21:05.999
You didn't give us any information about her.

368
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.269
Why would you need information about her?

369
00:21:10.209 --> 00:21:13.140
About how she lived for the past 25 years.

370
00:21:13.709 --> 00:21:16.679
There's no reason for us to know about that.

371
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.650
This is just the beginning.

372
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.150
What will you do with Eun Seok from now on?

373
00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:23.390
What's your plan?

374
00:21:23.989 --> 00:21:27.159
You'll see after your grandfather comes home.

375
00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:30.929
Make sure not to leak the news about her until then.

376
00:21:30.929 --> 00:21:33.699
When is Grandpa coming?

377
00:21:33.699 --> 00:21:36.269
He'll be here to see Eun Seok on Chuseok.

378
00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:39.800
Just leave it there.

379
00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.350
Get up.

380
00:21:55.489 --> 00:21:56.489
Pardon?

381
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.900
Before we have dessert,

382
00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:08.100
I will give my gift to Eun Seok now.

383
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.669
Well, you don't have to give it to me.

384
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:14.870
I'm not giving it to you.

385
00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.409
I'm putting it on you.

386
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.939
Oh, it's okay. I'll do it myself.

387
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.219
I'm glad that you're back safe. Thank you.

388
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.620
Thank you.

389
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.189
It looks pretty.

390
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.890
You got her a good one.

391
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.560
I agree.

392
00:22:39.429 --> 00:22:41.169
Just a bit more balance...

393
00:22:41.499 --> 00:22:42.929
and it'll be much better.

394
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.709
Ms. Min, give a call to the aesthetic shop...

395
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.939
- and the hair salon. - Yes, ma'am.

396
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:54.179
This is her first day. Give her a break.

397
00:22:54.249 --> 00:22:57.749
As it's her first day, she needs a fresh new start.

398
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.120
It looks like...

399
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.290
as if she's in someone else's house.

400
00:23:07.689 --> 00:23:09.489
I want 6 of this and 2 of that.

401
00:23:09.489 --> 00:23:11.959
Mi Jung. Yang Mi Jung!

402
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.800
- Hae Ja. - Gosh.

403
00:23:15.229 --> 00:23:16.370
What a coincidence!

404
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.699
I was about to visit you, but here you are.

405
00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:22.239
I heard Ji An had left.

406
00:23:23.169 --> 00:23:24.880
Haesung came here to pick her up, right?

407
00:23:25.209 --> 00:23:26.979
How did you know that?

408
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.650
The laundryman in your neighborhood saw that.

409
00:23:29.979 --> 00:23:33.179
How could you do that to me?

410
00:23:33.519 --> 00:23:36.320
You should've let me see Ji An before she left.

411
00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.659
It just happened somehow.

412
00:23:38.189 --> 00:23:41.429
- I want five big ones. - Okay.

413
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.290
What are you buying abalones for?

414
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.360
Is Tae Soo home?

415
00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:49.199
Tae Soo must have become ill...

416
00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:51.199
just as Ji An left, right?

417
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.810
I knew it.

418
00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.540
Poor Tae Soo. He loved Ji An so much.

419
00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.310
What's with you and all this grocery shopping?

420
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.150
Oh, this?

421
00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.650
My husband is coming.

422
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.749
Is he coming back from Vietnam?

423
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.650
When? Why all of a sudden?

424
00:24:23.769 --> 00:24:25.340
Where did he go?

425
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.840
He even folded back his bedding.

426
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.739
(Franchise Contract)

427
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:33.509
(Franchise Contract)

428
00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:41.820
He didn't even hear me out yet.

429
00:24:42.449 --> 00:24:45.390
What if he collapses in the streets again?

430
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.330
Seriously.

431
00:24:58.439 --> 00:25:00.499
The number you've dialed is switched off.

432
00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:03.269
Leave a message after the beep.

433
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.979
He even turned off his phone by anger.

434
00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:16.919
Grandpa.

435
00:25:19.259 --> 00:25:23.030
Grandpa. Can't you hear me?

436
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.400
- Me? - Yes.

437
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.959
I'm talking to you, Grandpa.

438
00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:30.169
All right. I'm an old man.

439
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.540
Why?

440
00:25:33.239 --> 00:25:36.469
You are wearing mismatched shoes.

441
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.580
Your mom won't be happy to see that.

442
00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:42.810
I'm sorry, sir.

443
00:25:48.689 --> 00:25:50.150
Darn it!

444
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.219
It must've been a while since you got a massage.

445
00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.189
You have flaky skin.

446
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:31.689
Well, right.

447
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.999
I thought I was getting my hair blow-dried.

448
00:27:42.729 --> 00:27:46.570
Your hair is damaged, so you need treatment first.

449
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:18.939
An unemployed woman in her 20s got a loan...

450
00:28:18.969 --> 00:28:20.300
of 20,000 dollars without security?

451
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.469
Isn't it a private loan?

452
00:28:21.469 --> 00:28:24.409
Even a loan shark needs security.

453
00:28:25.239 --> 00:28:26.280
Hang on.

454
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.150
If it's a woman in her 20s,

455
00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.880
would that be a collateral in and of itself?

456
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.519
But you'll give her 20,000 dollars?

457
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.150
It's not like she's your wife or girlfriend.

458
00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:38.290
She's nobody yet. 20,000 dollars?

459
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.090
I'm overreacting, right?

460
00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:42.689
Of course, I am.

461
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.199
But the thing is, I can't sit back and do nothing.

462
00:28:46.199 --> 00:28:47.259
It's your money,

463
00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:49.169
so I don't really have anything to say.

464
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:52.669
But if I were to give you a piece of advice...

465
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.870
You said you're expanding your woodworking shop.

466
00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.939
Weren't your savings meant for that?

467
00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.479
Do you think I'll blow my business money...

468
00:28:59.479 --> 00:29:00.979
just because of a girl?

469
00:29:01.409 --> 00:29:02.850
And even if I offered it,

470
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.280
Ji An wouldn't just take that money.

471
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.479
I'll tell her to pay me back in installments.

472
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.419
I have a very delicate palate,

473
00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.390
and the bread here perfectly suits my taste.

474
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.429
I don't do things like that.

475
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:17.560
Pardon me?

476
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.360
I don't sell my bread to other stores.

477
00:29:19.659 --> 00:29:22.169
My cafe is 330m².

478
00:29:22.169 --> 00:29:24.900
I'll order at least 50 of them a day.

479
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.439
Then I absolutely can't.

480
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.640
I only make a set number of bread a day.

481
00:29:28.769 --> 00:29:31.280
- Then you can make more. - Why should I?

482
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.249
If you sell 50 of that to my cafe each day,

483
00:29:35.249 --> 00:29:36.679
how much will you make a month?

484
00:29:36.679 --> 00:29:38.380
Why should I do such calculations?

485
00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.880
I won't sell them to you.

486
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.150
Goodness.

487
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.489
Unbelievable.

488
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.959
Mr. Kang, Mr. Kang.

489
00:29:50.959 --> 00:29:52.959
Why don't you want a contract with her cafe?

490
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.229
Because I'm not interested in making money.

491
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.169
But you are making money.

492
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:59.169
I mean, people line up to buy your bread.

493
00:29:59.169 --> 00:30:00.870
Why don't you want to make money?

494
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.140
Just go home.

495
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.640
Our bread for today is all sold out.

496
00:30:04.009 --> 00:30:05.939
They sold out earlier than usual today.

497
00:30:05.939 --> 00:30:07.979
It's only 4:30pm now.

498
00:30:07.979 --> 00:30:09.310
I can run petty errands for you.

499
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.979
Goodness, didn't you run out of the store...

500
00:30:11.979 --> 00:30:13.850
the other day looking like a crazy girl?

501
00:30:14.249 --> 00:30:15.989
Don't act like you care about me.

502
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.719
Just leave if you want to be helpful.

503
00:30:18.259 --> 00:30:19.560
Okay, then.

504
00:30:21.929 --> 00:30:24.530
I already paid for this.

505
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.429
I wanted to give it to my dad.

506
00:30:38.739 --> 00:30:41.679
Ji An. Even without your help,

507
00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:44.009
I decided on the price for the chair and bought it.

508
00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:45.850
I even found his online shop.

509
00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:47.749
You just wait and see.

510
00:30:47.989 --> 00:30:49.850
I'll make sure that this crush on Mr. Sun...

511
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.890
has a happy ending.

512
00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.729
But how can I make sure it has a happy ending?

513
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.100
I gave him my number,

514
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.900
but he hasn't even called me.

515
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.669
That basically means no.

516
00:31:04.769 --> 00:31:06.070
Right, Ji An?

517
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.370
What did I just do?

518
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.679
Gosh, don't do that. I'm such an idiot.

519
00:31:16.179 --> 00:31:17.820
Ji An, you're so mean.

520
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:20.580
Why do you keep popping up in my mind?

521
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.019
Shall I go there and act like I ran into him?

522
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560
Yes.

523
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:34.400
I don't need you, Ji An.

524
00:31:34.929 --> 00:31:37.669
I thought of a way to meet him without your help.

525
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:38.939
You wench.

526
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.070
(Women Only)

527
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.080
The number you have dialed is not available...

528
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.209
What's going on with Soo A?

529
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.120
You've been ignoring my calls and messages.

530
00:31:55.419 --> 00:31:57.189
Are you hibernating because it's Sunday?

531
00:31:57.449 --> 00:31:59.719
I've waited for an hour outside your building.

532
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.259
Call me when you get up.

533
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:09.229
(Ji Tae)

534
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.800
Soo A.

535
00:32:14.709 --> 00:32:16.370
Haven't you made up your mind yet?

536
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:19.040
Will you do it or not?

537
00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.679
I'll do it.

538
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.350
It's just a blind date. You took ages to decide.

539
00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.949
Then I'll set a time and date for it.

540
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.120
Okay.

541
00:32:36.459 --> 00:32:38.199
(Ji Tae, 4 missed calls)

542
00:32:39.929 --> 00:32:41.370
(Ji Tae)

543
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.110
Did you call me?

544
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:51.380
Eun Seok is back.

545
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.640
Go greet her.

546
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.350
She seemed so nervous and uncomfortable earlier.

547
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.380
Sure.

548
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.429
Hi, Eun Seok. You're back.

549
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.429
I'm back.

550
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.870
My, look at you, Eun Seok.

551
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.239
You're even prettier dressed up like this.

552
00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:24.810
It's not complete yet, but you look pretty good.

553
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.249
With a little more work, you'll look perfect.

554
00:33:30.009 --> 00:33:32.820
What's wrong? You don't like it?

555
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.320
It's not that.

556
00:33:34.989 --> 00:33:36.949
I was just coming home,

557
00:33:36.949 --> 00:33:39.419
so I thought all this makeup and new clothes...

558
00:33:39.419 --> 00:33:41.290
were a bit too much.

559
00:33:41.689 --> 00:33:43.489
You're our family now,

560
00:33:43.729 --> 00:33:45.900
so I wanted everything to be perfect.

561
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.360
I didn't have...

562
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.370
time to prepare these things before, you know.

563
00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:54.870
My gosh, who are you?

564
00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:58.780
Oh, my. You look amazing, Eun Seok.

565
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.540
You look gorgeous, my little sister.

566
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.050
Mom, you were right.

567
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.380
It looks like her past has been totally wiped clean.

568
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.419
Little sister,

569
00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:12.789
how do you feel being reborn?

570
00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.130
I'm feeling all right.

571
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.800
I do look like a different person.

572
00:34:27.539 --> 00:34:28.669
Eun Seok.

573
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.809
- Can I come in? - Of course. Come in.

574
00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:43.689
Take it. It's your allowance.

575
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.720
Gosh, it's okay.

576
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.260
I've waited for this moment for 25 years.

577
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:52.130
Thank you.

578
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.300
I'm sure you don't feel at home here yet.

579
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.769
You must feel awkward around us too.

580
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.530
There's no need to rush though.

581
00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.240
You'll get comfortable with everything in time.

582
00:35:00.869 --> 00:35:01.939
Right.

583
00:35:07.709 --> 00:35:10.380
Let me take you out on a date later.

584
00:35:10.479 --> 00:35:11.519
Okay.

585
00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:28.099
Tae Soo.

586
00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:30.800
Oh, Mr. Kang.

587
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.340
I sincerely apologize.

588
00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.570
I missed work and didn't even call you.

589
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.610
Are you packing up now...

590
00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.510
so you can take responsibility and quit?

591
00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.010
I heard that you hired someone.

592
00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:43.849
I hired him for only four days.

593
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.979
Your phone was off.

594
00:35:45.979 --> 00:35:48.320
How was I supposed to know when you'd be back?

595
00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.220
Does that mean...

596
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.590
We've worked together for so long.

597
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.590
You've never done that before,

598
00:35:55.729 --> 00:35:57.760
so I thought something must've happened to you.

599
00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.400
Unpack right away.

600
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.930
Thanks, Mr. Kang.

601
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.340
By the way, why did you turn your phone off?

602
00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.970
Oh, it ran out of battery.

603
00:36:07.939 --> 00:36:09.439
Come join me for soju.

604
00:36:09.439 --> 00:36:11.139
Okay, I'll be right there.

605
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.459
- Hello? - Tae Soo.

606
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.459
Why was your phone off?

607
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.300
Mr. Jang? Is it you, Seok Doo?

608
00:36:34.669 --> 00:36:36.530
- I'm home. - Hey.

609
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.039
Mom, how's Dad holding up?

610
00:36:39.139 --> 00:36:41.269
Dad went back to Daejeon.

611
00:36:41.439 --> 00:36:42.809
He went back?

612
00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:44.809
Why did he go back already?

613
00:36:44.979 --> 00:36:46.539
Being here reminds him of Ji An,

614
00:36:46.539 --> 00:36:48.550
so he probably didn't want to stay any longer.

615
00:36:48.749 --> 00:36:50.809
He has business in Daejeon, you know.

616
00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.079
He should've taken this.

617
00:36:53.419 --> 00:36:54.919
My gosh, what's this?

618
00:36:55.189 --> 00:36:57.249
He seemed too exhausted.

619
00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.619
And this is yours, Mom.

620
00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.090
Why did you buy one for me? I'm fine.

621
00:37:03.389 --> 00:37:04.930
Chuseok is just around the corner, you know.

622
00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:07.099
By the way, are you okay, Mom?

623
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.200
I said I'm fine.

624
00:37:09.669 --> 00:37:11.769
I'm talking about letting Ji An go like that.

625
00:37:12.169 --> 00:37:13.939
Among us, you must be the most upset.

626
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.709
It'll be better for her future, you know.

627
00:37:17.709 --> 00:37:20.010
You are all old enough to move out...

628
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.809
and start your own lives.

629
00:37:22.479 --> 00:37:25.249
Ji Tae, I'll go to Daejeon and give it to Dad.

630
00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:27.450
On my day off this week,

631
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:28.720
- I'll go... - Forget it!

632
00:37:31.189 --> 00:37:32.889
He'll come home for Chuseok,

633
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.430
so you should give it to him then.

634
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.130
Let's give him some time and space...

635
00:37:39.499 --> 00:37:41.599
so that he can pull himself together, okay?

636
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.099
All right.

637
00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:47.639
Then at least you should take one right away, Mom.

638
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.470
Your eyes look exhausted these days.

639
00:37:50.809 --> 00:37:52.709
I don't want you to collapse...

640
00:37:52.709 --> 00:37:54.249
because of someone who left us.

641
00:37:54.249 --> 00:37:56.280
Take this, okay? Come on.

642
00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:58.380
Here.

643
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.289
I'm happy to see you taking it.

644
00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:21.369
Come in.

645
00:38:22.709 --> 00:38:24.439
Have breakfast with us tomorrow.

646
00:38:24.439 --> 00:38:25.439
At 7am.

647
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.840
7am?

648
00:38:26.979 --> 00:38:29.010
That's when Mom and Dad eat.

649
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.510
Do Kyung too.

650
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:33.820
I join on special days if they tell me to.

651
00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.849
Usually, I eat depending on my lessons.

652
00:38:37.959 --> 00:38:39.490
Thanks for telling me.

653
00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:42.160
Ms. Min asked me to.

654
00:38:43.959 --> 00:38:46.760
Then I should thank Ms. Min.

655
00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:49.530
For giving me an excuse to talk to...

656
00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.169
my sister whom I haven't seen in 25 years.

657
00:38:52.639 --> 00:38:54.139
You can speak just fine.

658
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.240
Why not around Do Kyung?

659
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.479
He's trying really hard to be nice to you.

660
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.050
Do you fear men?

661
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.349
He even got you a necklace.

662
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.019
Yurmes' chief designer made a limited number...

663
00:39:08.019 --> 00:39:10.889
for Audrey Kelly's 100th birthday.

664
00:39:11.289 --> 00:39:13.119
Only 50 were imported.

665
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:15.860
I see.

666
00:39:16.189 --> 00:39:19.729
I made a preorder too but couldn't get one.

667
00:39:25.499 --> 00:39:26.639
This is for you then.

668
00:39:28.139 --> 00:39:29.470
Can I really have it?

669
00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.050
But I can't take your gift from Do Kyung.

670
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.749
The design isn't my taste.

671
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:41.419
You don't like the design?

672
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:47.289
She threw out all job-finding books.

673
00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.400
Why didn't she take this?

674
00:40:57.229 --> 00:40:58.430
Good morning, sister.

675
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.369
Did you sleep well?

676
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.570
Yes.

677
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.470
You had a long day, but you're up early.

678
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.970
Yes.

679
00:41:09.639 --> 00:41:12.240
Won't you greet me good morning? I did.

680
00:41:14.709 --> 00:41:16.249
Did you sleep well?

681
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:21.820
She won't call me, "brother".

682
00:41:22.889 --> 00:41:24.889
I said I'd be her brother.

683
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:33.660
Why is it so bland?

684
00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.329
The vegetables are bland and so is the fish.

685
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:41.309
Is the soup not to your taste?

686
00:41:41.639 --> 00:41:43.570
No, it's fine.

687
00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:45.139
They're wild pine mushrooms.

688
00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:47.209
Seo Hyun.

689
00:41:49.749 --> 00:41:51.849
Pine mushrooms contain vitamins B1, B2,

690
00:41:51.849 --> 00:41:54.720
and ergosterol which are good for you.

691
00:41:54.919 --> 00:41:56.619
You know what ergosterol is, right?

692
00:41:57.519 --> 00:41:59.619
No, I don't.

693
00:41:59.619 --> 00:42:01.459
It's a steroid found in ergot,

694
00:42:01.459 --> 00:42:03.430
yeast, and mushrooms.

695
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.099
When exposed to sunlight, it becomes vitamin D2.

696
00:42:06.099 --> 00:42:07.559
So it's also called provitamin D.

697
00:42:08.599 --> 00:42:10.729
What is ergot?

698
00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:16.639
I don't know that either.

699
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.510
We have a meeting and must leave now.

700
00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:21.809
Eun Seok.

701
00:42:22.579 --> 00:42:23.880
Go shopping with this.

702
00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.919
Go shopping for what?

703
00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:30.189
You can buy whatever you need,

704
00:42:30.619 --> 00:42:33.660
but you must spend every single cent.

705
00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.389
That's your mission for today.

706
00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.059
It's 30,000 dollars.

707
00:42:39.329 --> 00:42:41.900
3... 30,000 dollars?

708
00:42:44.939 --> 00:42:46.099
Take my car.

709
00:42:46.539 --> 00:42:49.869
Tell Ms. Min. She'll have Mr. Myung on standby.

710
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.780
No, I'll take a bus.

711
00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:54.510
Mr. Myung will drive you.

712
00:42:54.749 --> 00:42:56.749
Your mom can come with me.

713
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.519
Okay.

714
00:43:04.559 --> 00:43:06.720
Isn't her first mission a bit too tough?

715
00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.900
It's barely enough to get a decent watch.

716
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.369
Though she won't have the guts yet.

717
00:43:14.669 --> 00:43:15.700
Exactly.

718
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.269
She reminds me of the first time...

719
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.369
I set foot in your home.

720
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:44.760
(79 dollars)

721
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:57.110
- I'll take one. - Yes, just a moment.

722
00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:02.110
Here.

723
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:06.249
This check's for 1,000 dollars.

724
00:44:06.249 --> 00:44:09.019
Yes. Can you not give me any change?

725
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:12.619
You have to spend over 60 percent of the amount.

726
00:44:13.959 --> 00:44:15.289
Okay. Thanks.

727
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.669
How am I to spend 30,000 dollars?

728
00:44:23.669 --> 00:44:24.900
It's impossible.

729
00:44:34.209 --> 00:44:36.309
This is the cheaper brand you asked for.

730
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:03.039
This would look great on Ji Soo.

731
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.809
- Can I have one of these? - Sure.

732
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.680
Wait. Can I have one of these bags too?

733
00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:11.979
Yes.

734
00:45:18.789 --> 00:45:19.990
Excuse me.

735
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.090
Get me a new one of these, please.

736
00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:23.430
Thank you.

737
00:45:39.709 --> 00:45:41.579
Here's your latte.

738
00:45:41.579 --> 00:45:44.820
These are free samples. Taste them.

739
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:46.880
I don't like bread.

740
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.050
I feel bloated when I eat it.

741
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.189
The flour...

742
00:45:50.189 --> 00:45:52.260
probably isn't the reason for that.

743
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.930
Bread made only with flour is fine.

744
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.999
It's the additives that cause that sensation.

745
00:45:57.999 --> 00:46:00.300
Trust me, and try these.

746
00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:02.300
No, thanks.

747
00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.070
This is mocha bread.

748
00:46:04.099 --> 00:46:06.169
These are chestnut and sweet pumpkin bread.

749
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:08.340
There's sweet pumpkin bread?

750
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:24.689
What's wrong?

751
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:29.430
It's delicious.

752
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.499
Isn't it? It's so good you want to cry, right?

753
00:46:33.559 --> 00:46:35.099
You really appreciate it.

754
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:39.700
Our chef has a special kneading technique.

755
00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.479
You don't sell any food for the customers yet.

756
00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.309
I'll bring you some if you want.

757
00:46:56.789 --> 00:46:59.519
Where is your bakery?

758
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.559
How is your 20,000-dollar girl?

759
00:47:06.959 --> 00:47:08.169
Problem solved.

760
00:47:08.169 --> 00:47:10.070
Really? How?

761
00:47:10.369 --> 00:47:12.070
I'll tell you later. It's complicated.

762
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.410
It's not solved if it's complicated.

763
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:16.410
(Mom)

764
00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:20.139
Gi Jae, my mom's calling. Let's talk later.

765
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:23.309
Yes, Mom.

766
00:47:25.519 --> 00:47:26.519
The department store?

767
00:47:26.519 --> 00:47:28.849
It's so obvious that she'll be struggling.

768
00:47:29.019 --> 00:47:30.419
Go, and help her.

769
00:47:30.419 --> 00:47:33.090
Sure, I'll do that. Bye.

770
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:37.030
What a hassle.

771
00:47:38.099 --> 00:47:41.999
However, I am her older brother.

772
00:47:44.539 --> 00:47:47.240
We have to send some staff to the PR event.

773
00:47:47.499 --> 00:47:49.369
You two have to go to Hongdae.

774
00:47:49.369 --> 00:47:52.209
- Hongdae? - The youth gather there.

775
00:47:52.639 --> 00:47:55.280
Okay, sir. We'll give out our business cards too.

776
00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.079
Good. And hand over your duties to the other team.

777
00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.619
Yes, sir.

778
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.260
(Soo A)

779
00:48:14.059 --> 00:48:15.430
What's up?

780
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.570
Are you cheating on me?

781
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.269
You ignored all my texts and calls yesterday,

782
00:48:20.269 --> 00:48:21.269
and now, you ask what's up?

783
00:48:21.869 --> 00:48:23.439
I slept all day yesterday.

784
00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.439
We're currently busy with a tax investigation.

785
00:48:26.709 --> 00:48:28.309
Oh, I see.

786
00:48:28.749 --> 00:48:31.220
Then you can't have lunch today?

787
00:48:32.019 --> 00:48:33.820
What about dinner tomorrow?

788
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.650
I'll be out, and I might finish early.

789
00:48:36.119 --> 00:48:37.150
Tomorrow?

790
00:48:38.189 --> 00:48:40.789
I think I have to work late tomorrow too.

791
00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.590
Really?

792
00:48:43.559 --> 00:48:45.300
Soo A, you really are busy, aren't you?

793
00:48:45.729 --> 00:48:46.729
Bye.

794
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:51.369
Oh, well.

795
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:56.070
Thanks for coming to Daejeon.

796
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:57.110
What?

797
00:48:57.369 --> 00:48:59.979
I was glad to have an excuse to leave home.

798
00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.610
But why do you look so old all of a sudden?

799
00:49:04.209 --> 00:49:06.320
What about you? Have you been getting shots?

800
00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.189
Your face is all smooth and shiny.

801
00:49:08.189 --> 00:49:10.519
Me? Don't I look younger?

802
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.820
It's because I do everything I want.

803
00:49:16.289 --> 00:49:18.260
Don't you care about Hae Ja?

804
00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.070
I feel terrible for not being able to tell her.

805
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:24.439
Do you think she doesn't know...

806
00:49:24.439 --> 00:49:26.099
that I have another family in Vietnam?

807
00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.070
Did you tell her?

808
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.309
Whenever I am about to tell her,

809
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.840
she gets worked up and stops me.

810
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.749
So I haven't told her yet.

811
00:49:36.079 --> 00:49:38.079
You are making no sense.

812
00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:40.749
She'd throw a fit if she found out.

813
00:49:40.749 --> 00:49:41.820
Tae Soo.

814
00:49:41.919 --> 00:49:44.619
We've both been married for over 30 years,

815
00:49:44.619 --> 00:49:46.389
but you still know nothing about women.

816
00:49:47.059 --> 00:49:48.260
Women...

817
00:49:48.329 --> 00:49:51.229
Our wives are all the same. They know.

818
00:49:53.459 --> 00:49:55.970
Our food is here. Forget about our wives.

819
00:49:58.499 --> 00:50:02.010
Why do you want to start a business?

820
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:07.010
Why? You sent Ji An to a rich family.

821
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:09.510
They must have given you something.

822
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:12.019
Ji An moved in with them,

823
00:50:12.019 --> 00:50:14.119
so I must really succeed now.

824
00:50:14.119 --> 00:50:17.450
You worked hard for your entire life.

825
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.019
You're over 60 now.

826
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:21.130
You put food on the table.

827
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.930
You now need more than food to make a living.

828
00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:28.070
Does your wife still complain?

829
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.900
Well, women really never stop complaining until...

830
00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.769
their coffins are nailed shut.

831
00:50:33.769 --> 00:50:35.369
Just like our wives.

832
00:50:36.039 --> 00:50:38.410
- Eat up. - Stop talking nonsense.

833
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:41.479
Just tell me about your friend's business seminar.

834
00:50:41.479 --> 00:50:42.709
Where was it tomorrow?

835
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:45.680
Hello.

836
00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.349
Hello, is this Ms. Yang Mi Jung?

837
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.450
Yes, that's me.

838
00:50:51.019 --> 00:50:52.820
I'm Han Mi Young...

839
00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:54.530
from Haesung FNB.

840
00:50:55.229 --> 00:50:57.289
Oh, hello.

841
00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:00.400
Thank you for sending the signed contract over.

842
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.769
I heard the details from Ms. No.

843
00:51:06.269 --> 00:51:08.209
Ms. Yang sent the signed contract,

844
00:51:08.209 --> 00:51:09.840
so I put things into action.

845
00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.010
She sent it already?

846
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.809
That was earlier than we expected.

847
00:51:15.249 --> 00:51:18.380
She had no choice. Her husband's a daily laborer.

848
00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.749
Give them your full support.

849
00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:23.749
And don't tell Eun Seok until they tell her.

850
00:51:24.519 --> 00:51:25.889
What do you mean?

851
00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.630
The sooner she knows, the sooner she can...

852
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:30.329
forget about them and fit in with us.

853
00:51:30.329 --> 00:51:32.229
It'll only be a few days.

854
00:51:32.229 --> 00:51:34.700
They'll tell her when the store's ready to open.

855
00:51:35.229 --> 00:51:37.669
If they tell her we gave them the store,

856
00:51:37.669 --> 00:51:40.200
it will cause a rift between them.

857
00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.510
It means admitting that they got paid.

858
00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:47.650
You're right.

859
00:51:48.479 --> 00:51:51.150
Your plan is more efficient.

860
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.889
Then I won't tell Eun Seok.

861
00:52:02.059 --> 00:52:03.389
Mr. Myung.

862
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:06.229
I think I'll be here a while.

863
00:52:06.229 --> 00:52:08.430
I'll stay until the store closes.

864
00:52:08.499 --> 00:52:10.470
Go somewhere else, and take a break.

865
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:11.939
I'll give you a call.

866
00:52:15.169 --> 00:52:16.169
(Choi Do Kyung)

867
00:52:16.169 --> 00:52:18.180
Why's he calling?

868
00:52:26.479 --> 00:52:27.889
Hello.

869
00:52:41.269 --> 00:52:43.499
- Mom. - Ji An.

870
00:52:43.499 --> 00:52:45.939
I'm busy, so I'll just leave these here.

871
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:47.910
What's all this?

872
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:50.269
This is Dad's shirt and jacket.

873
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:52.680
I didn't get pants because I don't know his size.

874
00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.209
Here's a blouse and shoes for you.

875
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:56.650
Try them on now.

876
00:52:56.849 --> 00:52:59.380
Why did you buy all these?

877
00:52:59.419 --> 00:53:01.490
And these are for Ji Tae.

878
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:03.320
A new bag and a few ties.

879
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.059
His only bag is so worn out.

880
00:53:06.189 --> 00:53:08.630
I got Ji Ho sneakers and workout clothes.

881
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:10.360
For when he goes to study.

882
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:11.860
Ji An, wait.

883
00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:14.030
The other three are for Ji Soo.

884
00:53:14.499 --> 00:53:15.630
For whom?

885
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:17.639
Oh, dear. Ji Soo.

886
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:19.840
You're just on time.

887
00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.610
I thought I'd miss you.

888
00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:22.809
Try this on.

889
00:53:22.809 --> 00:53:24.939
I found something that would look...

890
00:53:24.939 --> 00:53:26.780
just perfect on you. What do you think?

891
00:53:28.809 --> 00:53:30.950
Hey, watch out. You'll tear it.

892
00:53:31.979 --> 00:53:33.320
Ji Soo.

893
00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:38.689
What are you doing?

894
00:53:43.329 --> 00:53:45.800
Mom, I'll call you later.

895
00:53:51.439 --> 00:53:52.539
Ji Soo.

896
00:53:54.709 --> 00:53:55.910
Seo Ji Soo.

897
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:59.880
Seo Ji Soo. What's wrong?

898
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:02.050
Don't do this again.

899
00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:03.749
We aren't beggars,

900
00:54:03.749 --> 00:54:05.249
ex-Seo Ji An.

901
00:54:06.249 --> 00:54:07.619
Will you please stop this?

902
00:54:07.619 --> 00:54:09.650
Dad collapsed while running after you.

903
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:12.260
He ran after your car, and you ignored him.

904
00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:15.860
Dad... Dad ran after me?

905
00:54:16.889 --> 00:54:18.430
So how is he?

906
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:20.300
Is he okay?

907
00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.630
I won't tell you.

908
00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:28.039
Why won't he stop calling?

909
00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:31.240
Hello?

910
00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.240
Where are you?

911
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:34.680
What's this about?

912
00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.680
I just asked where you are.

913
00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.349
Dad's not in.

914
00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.090
Yes, I took photos of you, mister.

915
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:51.459
Mom told me to help you,

916
00:54:51.499 --> 00:54:52.999
so I'm on my way to the department store.

917
00:54:53.059 --> 00:54:54.300
What?

918
00:54:54.329 --> 00:54:56.070
Are you not at the department store?

919
00:54:56.099 --> 00:54:57.570
Are you done already?

920
00:54:57.599 --> 00:55:00.300
No... No, I'm still here shopping.

921
00:55:01.209 --> 00:55:02.369
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

922
00:55:02.369 --> 00:55:04.280
Pick up right away when I call.

923
00:55:04.539 --> 00:55:07.110
Do you know which store I'm at?

924
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.079
Mom told me.

925
00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.519
Okay, see you.

926
00:55:14.249 --> 00:55:15.550
You witch.

927
00:55:15.889 --> 00:55:17.660
You couldn't even say you were coming here.

928
00:55:18.189 --> 00:55:20.660
Ji Soo, take these...

929
00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.329
Ji Soo!

930
00:55:37.539 --> 00:55:38.979
Did you see her off?

931
00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.380
Why won't you scold me?

932
00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:44.550
You did well.

933
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.849
I... I did well?

934
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:49.349
She needs to settle in over there.

935
00:55:51.559 --> 00:55:53.660
(Eldest daughter)

936
00:55:54.889 --> 00:55:56.059
What is it?

937
00:55:56.229 --> 00:55:58.829
Mom, I heard that Dad fainted.

938
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.300
Did he faint while running after me?

939
00:56:03.099 --> 00:56:04.669
He just felt dizzy from anemia.

940
00:56:04.669 --> 00:56:07.240
He got better right away and went to Daejeon.

941
00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.669
Don't worry about it.

942
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:13.479
He's really okay, so don't worry.

943
00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:16.650
And don't do what you just did today.

944
00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.380
Bye.

945
00:56:22.289 --> 00:56:23.320
Mom.

946
00:56:41.269 --> 00:56:42.769
Thank you.

947
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:46.079
Keep these for me. I'll come for them later.

948
00:56:46.579 --> 00:56:48.309
Yes, miss.

949
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:51.419
- Thank you. - Sure.

950
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:57.450
What an idiot.

951
00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.559
Hello?

952
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:08.499
Where are you? I'm here.

953
00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.939
Are you here already? I'm in the ladies' room.

954
00:57:16.539 --> 00:57:18.010
Excuse... Excuse me.

955
00:57:18.079 --> 00:57:20.079
Can I get the bags I left with you?

956
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.249
Here you go.

957
00:57:21.749 --> 00:57:22.849
Thank you.

958
00:57:26.519 --> 00:57:27.689
Hello.

959
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:30.590
You took all these to the toilet?

960
00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:33.019
Leave them at a store or the information desk.

961
00:57:33.889 --> 00:57:35.160
Oh, I should have.

962
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:39.200
- Are you done? - It's fine.

963
00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.369
What did you get?

964
00:57:45.869 --> 00:57:48.269
Well, this and that.

965
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:50.169
Women go for clothes first,

966
00:57:50.169 --> 00:57:51.579
so that should be done.

967
00:57:52.539 --> 00:57:54.110
- Purses? - Yes.

968
00:57:54.139 --> 00:57:55.880
- Watches? - That too.

969
00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.410
- Shoes? - Shoes too.

970
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:59.119
I have everything I need.

971
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.820
You still have money left.

972
00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:04.360
- Come with me. - No, I can manage.

973
00:58:09.459 --> 00:58:11.829
Mom told you to spend everything...

974
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:13.160
for a very good reason.

975
00:58:13.999 --> 00:58:16.700
I'm too tired to shop anymore.

976
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.070
I'll talk to her.

977
00:58:19.869 --> 00:58:20.869
Okay, then.

978
00:58:22.169 --> 00:58:23.309
Then let's go home.

979
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:26.180
Give me that. I'll go home with Mr. Myung.

980
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.349
Well... Hey!

981
00:58:38.689 --> 00:58:41.490
You must be hungry. Let's get a bite before we go.

982
00:58:42.189 --> 00:58:43.430
I'm okay.

983
00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.769
I'm your older brother. I'll buy you dinner.

984
00:58:49.499 --> 00:58:52.269
No, it's okay. I'm not hungry.

985
00:58:52.439 --> 00:58:54.570
I ate something before you came.

986
00:59:00.639 --> 00:59:02.979
If you are hungry...

987
00:59:02.979 --> 00:59:04.079
From now on,

988
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.220
you'll be enjoying many things.

989
00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:08.590
Once you get their trust.

990
00:59:09.749 --> 00:59:12.689
Can't we go home without talking to each other?

991
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:15.889
But as you know, trust is not something...

992
00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.559
you can easily get from someone.

993
00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:23.169
That sounds a little strange.

994
00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:26.400
Since I haven't lived with them, do I have to...

995
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.709
get their trust to become their daughter?

996
00:59:27.709 --> 00:59:28.809
Of course.

997
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.610
Whatever you think now,

998
00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:34.410
it's only correct where you used to live in.

999
00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:37.079
You know people have different thoughts.

1000
00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:40.619
So we have our own rules here.

1001
00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:43.990
I know that.

1002
00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:48.930
If you really know that,

1003
00:59:55.769 --> 00:59:57.200
give this money back to your boyfriend.

1004
00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:59.369
You can't break up with him with the debt.

1005
00:59:59.869 --> 01:00:02.439
- My boyfriend? - Who lent you this money.

1006
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:04.309
Did you tell him...

1007
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:07.110
- about our parents? - No.

1008
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:09.680
I don't have a boyfriend.

1009
01:00:10.979 --> 01:00:12.349
- You don't? - No.

1010
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:14.150
Break up with him.

1011
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:18.490
I have a male friend, but I don't have a boyfriend.

1012
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.289
Men and women can't be friends.

1013
01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.160
People have different ideas about that.

1014
01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:25.329
And this is...

1015
01:00:25.329 --> 01:00:26.959
It's hard to be your older brother.

1016
01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:29.269
Well, don't be.

1017
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:31.070
What?

1018
01:00:33.169 --> 01:00:36.039
You don't have to care about me.

1019
01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.280
We both feel so uncomfortable.

1020
01:00:38.939 --> 01:00:40.240
You don't have to do this.

1021
01:00:47.479 --> 01:00:48.950
They're home.

1022
01:00:50.349 --> 01:00:52.019
What took them so long?

1023
01:00:52.019 --> 01:00:53.720
They just went to the department store.

1024
01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.889
I guess they caught up on old times...

1025
01:00:57.289 --> 01:00:58.829
talking about their past.

1026
01:00:59.559 --> 01:01:00.700
We're home.

1027
01:01:01.169 --> 01:01:02.900
We're home.

1028
01:01:03.229 --> 01:01:06.599
You're late. Did you two catch up on old times?

1029
01:01:06.669 --> 01:01:08.470
I arrived at the department store late.

1030
01:01:08.709 --> 01:01:11.579
I couldn't help her shop. I just carried her stuff.

1031
01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.950
Let me see if you have an eye for fashion.

1032
01:01:22.189 --> 01:01:24.260
Well... Okay.

1033
01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:31.700
Not that one. I want to see the receipts.

1034
01:01:31.959 --> 01:01:32.999
Pardon?

1035
01:01:34.099 --> 01:01:36.570
Did you not get the receipts?

1036
01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.869
Men's shoes. Men's clothes.

1037
01:01:43.809 --> 01:01:46.309
Sportswear. Running shoes.

1038
01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.180
Necktie.

1039
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:51.180
Bag.

1040
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.749
Dress. Bag.

1041
01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:58.689
I have the receipts...

1042
01:01:59.419 --> 01:02:01.689
for the things you don't have here.

1043
01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:05.829
I told you to buy something for you.

1044
01:02:05.999 --> 01:02:09.300
But the half of them are for your old family.

1045
01:02:10.599 --> 01:02:13.099
Well... I was...

1046
01:02:14.639 --> 01:02:17.680
Your family must've been happy. It's okay.

1047
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:23.809
Why does she not tell Mom the truth?

1048
01:02:24.749 --> 01:02:26.320
Don't do that ever again though.

1049
01:02:27.889 --> 01:02:29.150
Money should be spent...

1050
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:32.720
for what the owner of it wants.

1051
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:36.990
Okay. I understand.

1052
01:02:38.559 --> 01:02:41.970
Why isn't she telling Mom they didn't accept it?

1053
01:02:47.709 --> 01:02:49.110
I'm home.

1054
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:51.809
I'm late because of my practice for the concert.

1055
01:02:53.439 --> 01:02:56.209
Why are you wearing that necklace?

1056
01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.720
Did you take it from your sister?

1057
01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.650
No. Eun Seok gave it to me.

1058
01:03:01.919 --> 01:03:03.749
She gave it to you?

1059
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:07.660
I said I wouldn't take it because it's your gift,

1060
01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.530
but she gave me it saying it's not her style.

1061
01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.459
Okay.

1062
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:32.979
I need to talk to you.

1063
01:03:38.689 --> 01:03:39.990
Boyfriend?

1064
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.789
Eun Seok says she doesn't have a boyfriend.

1065
01:03:43.329 --> 01:03:46.400
She borrowed 20,000 dollars from me before.

1066
01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.300
She borrowed 20,000 dollars?

1067
01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.900
The money was from you?

1068
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:52.669
The money?

1069
01:03:52.669 --> 01:03:54.200
No, nothing.

1070
01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.470
So did you give her the money?

1071
01:03:57.309 --> 01:03:58.579
I did.

1072
01:03:59.639 --> 01:04:01.780
It might not be about a boyfriend.

1073
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:04.950
But she sounded serious. I'm worried about that.

1074
01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.950
I should've checked up on it sooner.

1075
01:04:12.559 --> 01:04:15.160
Okay. I'll work on it.

1076
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:20.260
It shouldn't leak. I need you to take care of it.

1077
01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.499
Okay.

1078
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.209
Whether you are Choi Eun Seok or Seo Ji An,

1079
01:04:29.369 --> 01:04:31.380
You are a lot of work.

1080
01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:39.619
We stay in a separate building.

1081
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.530
Hyuk, why are you calling me at this hour?

1082
01:04:52.099 --> 01:04:55.070
I'm sorry. My work finished late.

1083
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:56.930
Then you should call me tomorrow.

1084
01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.369
I had to tell you something today.

1085
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.910
I need you...

1086
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:04.880
to answer my questions truthfully.

1087
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.610
What? 20,000 dollars?

1088
01:05:07.039 --> 01:05:08.809
Are you calling me at this hour because of that?

1089
01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.780
I got the money back.

1090
01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.450
Are you out of your mind? Why do you even care?

1091
01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.889
What?

1092
01:05:19.619 --> 01:05:21.130
Is he asking her for money?

1093
01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:24.630
What? Now? It's late.

1094
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:25.959
I can't see you now.

1095
01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:28.700
- I'll go to your place. - Don't do that.

1096
01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:31.369
I can't see you today. I'll see you tomorrow.

1097
01:05:31.369 --> 01:05:33.470
I'll see you tomorrow at noon. I have to go.

1098
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.340
What's wrong with him?

1099
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:38.610
What's wrong with you?

1100
01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:46.079
Did I startle you?

1101
01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:47.950
What is it?

1102
01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.419
Who do you think I am?

1103
01:05:51.519 --> 01:05:55.160
Do you think I'm someone you can talk to like that?

1104
01:05:56.189 --> 01:05:57.329
I've had enough of this.

1105
01:05:57.329 --> 01:05:59.599
You're just going too far.

1106
01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:01.729
I knew you'd be like that though.

1107
01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:03.599
What are you talking about?

1108
01:06:03.599 --> 01:06:05.039
What was your name? Seo Ji An?

1109
01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.869
Get out of our house now.

1110
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:13.579
- What? - Get out of this house!

1111
01:06:23.203 --> 01:06:28.203
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1112
01:06:43.669 --> 01:06:45.880
(My Golden Life)

1113
01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:51.950
You just awoke a sleeping lion.

1114
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.519
What on earth did you do?

1115
01:06:53.519 --> 01:06:55.519
Pay it back with this. Get out of it now.

1116
01:06:55.519 --> 01:06:56.749
Do you like me?

1117
01:06:56.749 --> 01:06:58.389
Why does it sound like a scolding?

1118
01:06:58.419 --> 01:06:59.559
We don't belong to each other.

1119
01:06:59.559 --> 01:07:00.689
He's not your boyfriend?

1120
01:07:00.689 --> 01:07:02.889
I'll have to take care of her.

1121
01:07:02.889 --> 01:07:04.599
I want to get married.

1122
01:07:04.599 --> 01:07:06.559
You said you'd never get married.

1123
01:07:06.559 --> 01:07:07.669
I just can't...

1124
01:07:07.669 --> 01:07:10.939
pass down poverty to my children.

1125
01:07:10.939 --> 01:07:13.099
Ji Soo, are you happy?

1126
01:07:13.099 --> 01:07:14.939
There hasn't been a moment...

1127
01:07:14.939 --> 01:07:16.610
that I wasn't happy.

1128
01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:18.110
But I'm unhappy now.
