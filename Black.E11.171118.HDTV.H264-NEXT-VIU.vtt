1
00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:18.986
- Repeal. - Repeal.

2
00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:20.885
Stop the act.

3
00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:22.655
- Stop the act. - Stop the act.

4
00:00:22.986 --> 00:00:24.626
- This is it. - Get off.

5
00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:25.696
- Get off. - Get off.

6
00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:53.116
- Let go of her! Stop it! - What is this?

7
00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:54.425
What are you?

8
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:03.752
Fire? It wasn't here.

9
00:01:07.822 --> 00:01:08.822
(Choi Joon Seok)

10
00:01:21.072 --> 00:01:24.041
You're driving me crazy. Why did you leave the kids in there?

11
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:27.572
Gosh...

12
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:29.242
You jerks...

13
00:01:29.242 --> 00:01:30.912
- I'll teach you a lesson. - Where are the kids?

14
00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:32.341
Let go! Let go of me.

15
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:33.981
(Reveal the truth! Tell me why my son died!)

16
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:35.251
(You already killed hundreds, Will you kill more)

17
00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:38.882
- I'll go check on them. - Okay.

18
00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:41.552
The kid... Gosh. Where is he?

19
00:01:41.552 --> 00:01:44.022
- Over there. He's over there. - Sorry?

20
00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:46.362
- There? Where exactly... Gosh! - Yes! Gosh!

21
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:56.942
Ha Ram. Hey!

22
00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:23.492
You said you'd like the vanilla flavor, right?

23
00:02:23.862 --> 00:02:26.901
Just one vanilla ice cream, please.

24
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.101
- The spaghetti... - It looks like you're having fun.

25
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:31.302
- Yes. - Are you playing with your dolls?

26
00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:32.341
- Yes. - Yes.

27
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:34.012
Your parents will be back soon.

28
00:03:01.772 --> 00:03:03.371
- What is that? - Seriously.

29
00:03:23.492 --> 00:03:24.721
Let go. Enough, you punks.

30
00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:25.992
Stop it!

31
00:03:26.422 --> 00:03:28.691
Stop... Stop it already, you jerk.

32
00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.561
I'm a police officer. Hey!

33
00:03:33.702 --> 00:03:36.272
Freeze! Stay still, you jerks.

34
00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:37.901
Unless you want me to put a hole through your brain.

35
00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:42.672
Where did she go now?

36
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:48.682
What? Who did this?

37
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:50.422
Gosh, what should I do?

38
00:03:50.952 --> 00:03:52.422
My goodness.

39
00:03:52.522 --> 00:03:54.591
Hello? Is anybody inside?

40
00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.862
Help us, please.

41
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:01.432
- Here. - Are you okay, sir?

42
00:04:01.432 --> 00:04:02.762
- There are kids inside. - Kids...

43
00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:04.531
Gosh, what should we do?

44
00:04:06.232 --> 00:04:09.001
What's going on over there? Gosh, this is crazy.

45
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:28.251
How can I get this open?

46
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.162
Joon. Joon, help me with this.

47
00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:35.492
What should I do? I can't open this lock.

48
00:04:35.592 --> 00:04:37.631
There are kids inside. What should we do?

49
00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:41.432
Plus, most of the souls were kids.

50
00:04:41.932 --> 00:04:44.941
Kids who didn't know why they had to die.

51
00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:47.871
Kids who had so many days to live ahead.

52
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:49.871
Collecting souls of kids,

53
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:52.412
who were full of dreams about their future,

54
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:55.581
obviously couldn't have been easy.

55
00:04:55.581 --> 00:04:57.121
It won't take long. Wait just a little, okay?

56
00:04:58.621 --> 00:04:59.881
No.

57
00:05:00.552 --> 00:05:02.992
I should never get involved in attempts to save human lives.

58
00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:05.222
What should I do?

59
00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:09.862
Kids, wait just a little longer, okay?

60
00:05:15.102 --> 00:05:16.172
No.

61
00:05:16.172 --> 00:05:17.602
We call those who have lost their spouses by death...

62
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:20.472
"widow" or "widower".

63
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:23.612
And kids who have lost their parents are called orphans.

64
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:25.682
But do you know what parents...

65
00:05:26.782 --> 00:05:28.482
who have lost their children are called?

66
00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.081
There's no such word.

67
00:05:30.282 --> 00:05:31.881
It's so cruel...

68
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:34.552
that there's no word for it.

69
00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:40.831
Step back.

70
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:53.302
Come out!

71
00:06:02.951 --> 00:06:04.581
- No, what should we do? - Joon Seok!

72
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:05.581
Joon Seok!

73
00:06:05.982 --> 00:06:07.152
Rescue them quickly!

74
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:10.222
- Hurry up! - My son...

75
00:06:10.422 --> 00:06:12.461
- Joon Seok! - My son!

76
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:17.201
- What's this? What is this? - Open the door!

77
00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:19.061
- Come out! - Call the ambulance now!

78
00:06:19.432 --> 00:06:20.831
- Dad... - Come here.

79
00:06:23.172 --> 00:06:25.641
Where's the ambulance? Is the ambulance here yet?

80
00:06:25.742 --> 00:06:28.711
- Where's Joon Seok? - Joon Seok!

81
00:06:30.172 --> 00:06:31.982
Isn't that Ha Ram?

82
00:06:32.542 --> 00:06:34.381
Why is she here?

83
00:06:35.652 --> 00:06:36.682
Ha Ram!

84
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:42.222
Ha Ram!

85
00:06:43.722 --> 00:06:44.761
Ha Ram!

86
00:06:45.422 --> 00:06:46.992
- Joon Seok! - My child...

87
00:06:46.992 --> 00:06:49.891
- Hey, get out of my way! - My child is still in there!

88
00:06:49.961 --> 00:06:51.061
Ha Ram!

89
00:06:51.862 --> 00:06:53.032
Hey!

90
00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:01.271
Let me get you out of here.

91
00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:03.811
Come here. Get out of there.

92
00:07:04.381 --> 00:07:05.881
- I don't want to. - Gosh.

93
00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:07.912
Do whatever you want then.

94
00:07:17.092 --> 00:07:18.662
It's okay. Come here, okay?

95
00:07:18.662 --> 00:07:20.761
- I don't want to. I'm scared. - Come on.

96
00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:22.891
- It's okay. It's all right. - I'm scared.

97
00:07:23.032 --> 00:07:24.961
Come out. Come on.

98
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:28.771
There you did it. Good girl.

99
00:07:28.771 --> 00:07:30.742
All right. You're fine now.

100
00:07:30.972 --> 00:07:32.042
Get out.

101
00:07:37.282 --> 00:07:38.842
- Thank you. - Get out of here now.

102
00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:39.982
Okay.

103
00:07:44.682 --> 00:07:45.782
Ha Ram.

104
00:07:46.081 --> 00:07:47.792
- Joon Seok! - He hasn't come out yet.

105
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:51.061
(Choi Joon Seok)

106
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:53.761
- Joon. - Let's get out of here.

107
00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:55.292
I think Hoon Seok's dad is still inside.

108
00:07:55.292 --> 00:07:57.061
Get this kid out of here first.

109
00:07:57.061 --> 00:07:58.131
What?

110
00:07:58.131 --> 00:07:59.631
Hey, hey!

111
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:02.172
Come here.

112
00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:05.472
- Are you in there? Hoon Seok... - Hey!

113
00:08:06.042 --> 00:08:07.972
- Come on. Let's go. - Joon.

114
00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:09.342
Enough, already!

115
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:10.742
You said that you never want to die.

116
00:08:10.742 --> 00:08:11.742
Just a minute.

117
00:08:12.482 --> 00:08:14.451
- Hey! - Mister!

118
00:08:15.612 --> 00:08:16.782
Mister...

119
00:08:17.482 --> 00:08:19.552
Mister, wake up.

120
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:24.621
Wake up. You can't die!

121
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:27.831
You need to save your son's life. Please wake up!

122
00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:29.391
Come here.

123
00:08:30.362 --> 00:08:33.132
Wake up. Please wake up!

124
00:08:33.532 --> 00:08:34.932
Wake up already!

125
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:37.101
- Ha Ram! - You have to save your son's life.

126
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:38.872
- Where are you, Ha Ram? - Joon, I'm here.

127
00:08:39.002 --> 00:08:40.571
- Help him. - Move. Just get out of here!

128
00:08:45.382 --> 00:08:46.682
Excuse me.

129
00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.682
- Please help me. - Let's go!

130
00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:50.882
- Take this kid, and get out. - What?

131
00:08:52.652 --> 00:08:53.821
Where are you going now?

132
00:08:54.652 --> 00:08:56.392
- Are you under here? - Help me.

133
00:08:56.552 --> 00:08:58.461
- Just a moment. - Over here.

134
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.392
My gosh.

135
00:09:11.902 --> 00:09:13.872
Come out. Hurry up!

136
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:16.772
We can't let them die in there.

137
00:09:20.382 --> 00:09:22.882
- All right. - Send us more ambulances!

138
00:09:23.052 --> 00:09:25.522
- His current condition is... - Send us more ambulances now!

139
00:09:25.682 --> 00:09:27.552
You only sent us three.

140
00:09:29.422 --> 00:09:31.622
- Take him. - Hurry up!

141
00:09:36.731 --> 00:09:38.132
The ambulances are over there.

142
00:09:39.461 --> 00:09:40.902
Get the kids in first.

143
00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:43.741
Do it like this. From the side. Slowly now.

144
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:46.402
- Hey, come here. - Is his face seriously injured?

145
00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:51.711
Are you okay? Did you get any injuries?

146
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:55.412
What's gotten into you? It's so unlike you to try to rescue a kid.

147
00:09:55.412 --> 00:09:58.522
Then what? No parents would just walk out...

148
00:09:58.522 --> 00:10:01.451
when a child is dying right in front of them, you wench.

149
00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:05.662
By the way, what brings you here?

150
00:10:05.762 --> 00:10:06.762
That's none of your business.

151
00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:11.061
Well, Hoon Seok is waiting for your marrow. You should hurry.

152
00:10:12.201 --> 00:10:13.731
Okay, thanks.

153
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:24.741
You said that your life motto is to never die, didn't you?

154
00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:28.981
How can you be so reckless when you're that attached to life?

155
00:10:29.081 --> 00:10:30.081
Look at what you did today.

156
00:10:30.382 --> 00:10:33.422
You jumped into the fire multiple times to save lives.

157
00:10:33.851 --> 00:10:35.821
You might die if you keep that up.

158
00:10:38.861 --> 00:10:41.061
I just can't understand you.

159
00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:44.932
All humans fear death. Doesn't it scare you? Don't you fear death?

160
00:10:46.502 --> 00:10:50.272
Who doesn't fear death? I'm scared of it too.

161
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:52.002
But...

162
00:10:54.042 --> 00:10:56.882
I fear it less than seeing someone die...

163
00:10:57.581 --> 00:10:59.981
right in front of my eyes.

164
00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:06.451
Give me that.

165
00:11:09.022 --> 00:11:10.262
Just stay still.

166
00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:13.561
It's making your ugly face look even uglier.

167
00:11:15.262 --> 00:11:16.662
- Goodness. - What is all this?

168
00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:26.201
Close your eyes. The soot will get into your eyes.

169
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:28.012
Close your eyes.

170
00:11:36.111 --> 00:11:37.282
What's wrong?

171
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:39.951
One ambulance just left the site.

172
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:41.392
Nothing.

173
00:11:43.451 --> 00:11:45.262
Wipe it yourself. Here.

174
00:11:45.922 --> 00:11:47.262
Do you have no hands or what?

175
00:11:49.032 --> 00:11:52.162
What's with him? He said he'd do it for me. Why is he so fickle-minded?

176
00:11:56.172 --> 00:11:57.741
We didn't do it.

177
00:11:57.802 --> 00:12:00.142
I'm telling you the truth. We never locked that door,

178
00:12:00.142 --> 00:12:01.772
and we didn't start the fire either.

179
00:12:01.772 --> 00:12:03.811
Please just answer my question.

180
00:12:04.581 --> 00:12:06.542
- Hang on a second. - Gwang Gyun, please. Seriously.

181
00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:09.182
All right, just for a second. I can't stand these jerks.

182
00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:11.581
Are you saying that this barrel of oil...

183
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:15.951
- did this on its own? - Gosh, seriously.

184
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.321
Goodness, stop it.

185
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:19.792
How dare you lie to our faces?

186
00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:22.091
We have solid evidence right here!

187
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:24.831
All of them were found in your car, you jerks.

188
00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:26.561
That's just something we...

189
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:29.432
Just what? Just to scare them, right?

190
00:12:29.432 --> 00:12:30.571
Weren't you going to say that?

191
00:12:30.841 --> 00:12:34.512
Thugs always give the same excuses ever since the 50s.

192
00:12:34.512 --> 00:12:36.241
- You guys are so predictable. - Gwang Gyun.

193
00:12:36.241 --> 00:12:39.481
We'll take care of this, so please leave us alone, okay? I'm sorry.

194
00:12:39.481 --> 00:12:42.412
You idiot. They're lying because you're acting like a pushover.

195
00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:44.721
The world is changing so fast.

196
00:12:44.721 --> 00:12:46.382
Look, we now use things like cell phones and...

197
00:12:46.382 --> 00:12:48.951
- credit card bills arrive by text! - You jerks deserve to be stuffed...

198
00:12:48.951 --> 00:12:51.361
with hydrochloric acid and thrown into the Pacific Ocean!

199
00:13:01.432 --> 00:13:02.672
Let me ask you something first.

200
00:13:03.302 --> 00:13:04.741
Why did you come to Moojin?

201
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:06.912
I was running some errands.

202
00:13:06.912 --> 00:13:08.872
Errands? What errands?

203
00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.042
What about you? Why were you there?

204
00:13:10.042 --> 00:13:11.711
Me? I was running errands.

205
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:13.782
Errands? What errands?

206
00:13:15.652 --> 00:13:17.282
My gosh, you brat.

207
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:20.552
Forget it. The skeleton I told you about.

208
00:13:20.552 --> 00:13:23.191
If you remember anything about it, tell me right away. Okay?

209
00:13:28.162 --> 00:13:29.831
You brat.

210
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:31.831
They say everyone has a talent.

211
00:13:32.762 --> 00:13:34.402
What's your relationship with that girl?

212
00:13:41.912 --> 00:13:43.341
It's none of your business.

213
00:13:45.682 --> 00:13:47.012
Why you little...

214
00:13:47.182 --> 00:13:48.552
Royeol Complex Shopping Mall...

215
00:13:48.552 --> 00:13:50.422
How could you mess this up? I told you to scare them.

216
00:13:50.422 --> 00:13:52.422
- Why did you lock up children? - There was a fire.

217
00:13:52.552 --> 00:13:55.221
- A congressman got injured as well. - The children of protesters...

218
00:13:55.221 --> 00:13:57.361
How are you going to settle this mess?

219
00:13:57.361 --> 00:13:58.762
I think someone pulled a trick.

220
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:00.961
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:03.561
It's my fault that I didn't check...

222
00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:19.682
- We're not open yet. - Darn it.

223
00:14:21.412 --> 00:14:23.382
Why did you lie to me? Why?

224
00:14:23.552 --> 00:14:25.682
What do you think you're doing?

225
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:28.191
Clara didn't run away, did she?

226
00:14:28.191 --> 00:14:30.052
What on earth happened that night?

227
00:14:30.052 --> 00:14:32.662
Tell me! Tell me the truth!

228
00:14:33.292 --> 00:14:35.491
Well, about that.

229
00:14:36.632 --> 00:14:40.902
Well... It was a troubled time...

230
00:14:41.101 --> 00:14:43.772
because a mart collapsed downtown.

231
00:14:45.372 --> 00:14:50.341
Oh, right. It was the day when they found Woo Byung Sik's body.

232
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.542
Jin Sook said...

233
00:14:52.741 --> 00:14:55.951
Clara dragged Sun Young by the hair to the mountain.

234
00:14:55.951 --> 00:14:58.152
She talked gibberish, saying we need to find them.

235
00:14:58.152 --> 00:15:00.591
So we went to look for them together,

236
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:02.922
but we couldn't find them anywhere.

237
00:15:03.792 --> 00:15:06.821
We gave up and came back to the bar.

238
00:15:06.932 --> 00:15:10.762
We never saw Clara and Sun Young after that day.

239
00:15:10.762 --> 00:15:14.002
Jin Sook also disappeared after that.

240
00:15:14.002 --> 00:15:17.201
That means Clara didn't run away.

241
00:15:17.201 --> 00:15:20.512
Why did you lie to me that she did? Why?

242
00:15:23.981 --> 00:15:25.142
It's you, isn't it?

243
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:28.851
You took the money and the bankbook from Clara's house, didn't you?

244
00:15:29.311 --> 00:15:31.522
That's why you didn't even report her...

245
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:33.282
as a missing person, isn't it?

246
00:15:34.721 --> 00:15:36.591
No, that's...

247
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:40.861
If I had left it there,

248
00:15:40.861 --> 00:15:44.861
the police would've taken it all.

249
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:47.731
I thought it'd be better for me to keep it...

250
00:15:47.731 --> 00:15:49.372
and when Clara comes back...

251
00:15:49.672 --> 00:15:51.101
Stop lying!

252
00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:53.341
If you had left it there,

253
00:15:53.341 --> 00:15:56.642
I would've believed that Clara didn't run away.

254
00:15:56.642 --> 00:15:58.542
I would've found her by any means.

255
00:15:58.711 --> 00:15:59.981
If I had, she wouldn't have...

256
00:16:02.782 --> 00:16:04.851
returned like this.

257
00:16:06.851 --> 00:16:09.052
Is this Clara?

258
00:16:09.091 --> 00:16:10.821
Oh, dear.

259
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:17.101
When you met Han Jin Sook again,

260
00:16:17.231 --> 00:16:19.361
did she really not say anything about what happened that day?

261
00:16:19.361 --> 00:16:20.632
She didn't.

262
00:16:21.071 --> 00:16:23.272
That's not a lie.

263
00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:26.642
I was curious too, so I asked her about it to find them myself.

264
00:16:26.971 --> 00:16:28.941
But whenever I brought up Clara's name,

265
00:16:29.372 --> 00:16:31.441
she kept her mouth shut.

266
00:16:33.652 --> 00:16:34.711
But...

267
00:16:36.311 --> 00:16:39.821
something must've happened indeed. Jin Sook said...

268
00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:44.991
she and Sun Young promised not to talk about it forever.

269
00:16:45.491 --> 00:16:49.392
And if they do, that man would kill her.

270
00:16:49.991 --> 00:16:51.061
"That man"?

271
00:16:53.831 --> 00:16:55.002
Who is that?

272
00:16:55.672 --> 00:16:57.672
I don't know that.

273
00:16:59.272 --> 00:17:03.471
Jin Sook seemed so scared.

274
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:05.812
He probably...

275
00:17:06.882 --> 00:17:08.051
killed...

276
00:17:09.082 --> 00:17:10.652
Jin Sook too.

277
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:17.021
Detective.

278
00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:19.322
Hi.

279
00:17:20.092 --> 00:17:23.132
Look. Did your wife tell you anything about her old friend?

280
00:17:23.132 --> 00:17:25.162
Her childhood friend?

281
00:17:25.162 --> 00:17:28.402
Do you remember anything your wife said to you about her friend?

282
00:17:29.971 --> 00:17:32.201
I don't think she told me anything about a friend.

283
00:17:35.912 --> 00:17:38.182
Do you remember anything at all?

284
00:17:38.582 --> 00:17:39.682
Pardon?

285
00:17:40.011 --> 00:17:41.352
Never mind.

286
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:45.051
Anyway, if you remember anything, call me right away. Okay?

287
00:17:45.682 --> 00:17:47.451
- Answer me. - I will.

288
00:17:48.852 --> 00:17:50.562
Why didn't they talk more? They were married.

289
00:17:51.221 --> 00:17:52.721
My gosh.

290
00:17:53.021 --> 00:17:55.092
Why is that jerk being so rude to me?

291
00:17:56.162 --> 00:17:57.761
He thinks he's a big man because he's a detective.

292
00:17:59.332 --> 00:18:00.372
Gosh.

293
00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:03.102
Welcome...

294
00:18:06.801 --> 00:18:10.241
Goodness, why is he here again?

295
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:17.251
(Emergency Medical Center)

296
00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:19.481
Why did you want to come here again?

297
00:18:19.481 --> 00:18:21.691
I need to check if Hoon Seok's shadow is gone.

298
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:23.422
Thank you for the ride.

299
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:33.402
What have I done today?

300
00:18:33.402 --> 00:18:35.432
I can't believe I saved humans.

301
00:18:35.432 --> 00:18:37.872
I must be insane.

302
00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:55.721
Ha Ram.

303
00:18:57.991 --> 00:18:59.392
Are you hurt anywhere?

304
00:19:02.261 --> 00:19:03.602
Hoon Seok isn't going to die.

305
00:19:04.132 --> 00:19:07.201
His dad told me what happened.

306
00:19:08.132 --> 00:19:10.642
You went there to save his life.

307
00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:17.981
What happened? Did you get burned?

308
00:19:22.082 --> 00:19:23.652
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:23.652 --> 00:19:26.322
I knew it might put you in danger,

310
00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:29.721
but I wasn't in my right mind then...

311
00:19:30.291 --> 00:19:31.991
because of Hoon Seok.

312
00:19:31.991 --> 00:19:34.432
I didn't think you had any maternal love.

313
00:19:36.191 --> 00:19:38.402
How could you be so affectionate towards Hoon Seok?

314
00:19:39.932 --> 00:19:43.271
You try so hard to save a boy whom you're not even related by blood.

315
00:19:43.271 --> 00:19:45.102
Why did you do that to me, your real daughter?

316
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:47.872
Why did you try to kill me?

317
00:19:50.241 --> 00:19:51.241
What?

318
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:53.142
I always wanted to ask you this.

319
00:19:54.082 --> 00:19:56.652
I was struggling not to die.

320
00:19:58.082 --> 00:19:59.852
Why did you do that to me?

321
00:20:00.791 --> 00:20:03.562
Take it. Take it!

322
00:20:03.562 --> 00:20:05.822
- Take it, and let's die together. - Dad!

323
00:20:05.822 --> 00:20:06.991
Take it!

324
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:08.832
I've thought about it hundreds of times,

325
00:20:08.991 --> 00:20:10.961
but I just can't understand.

326
00:20:11.602 --> 00:20:12.632
Tell me.

327
00:20:13.231 --> 00:20:15.001
Why did you try to kill me then?

328
00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:17.941
Why did you do that?

329
00:20:18.172 --> 00:20:19.342
I was scared.

330
00:20:22.412 --> 00:20:24.011
I did it because I was scared.

331
00:20:24.142 --> 00:20:25.211
What?

332
00:20:27.652 --> 00:20:28.751
You were scared?

333
00:20:30.182 --> 00:20:31.951
Did I look like a monster to you?

334
00:20:33.852 --> 00:20:35.852
Is that why you tried to kill me?

335
00:20:36.491 --> 00:20:37.761
Is that it?

336
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:41.491
I'm your daughter.

337
00:20:43.632 --> 00:20:47.731
What kind of mother is scared of her own daughter?

338
00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:55.572
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:12.961 --> 00:21:14.731
Joon, you're still here.

340
00:21:16.592 --> 00:21:18.801
I have nothing else to do at home anyway.

341
00:21:18.801 --> 00:21:20.501
I have some time on my hands.

342
00:21:21.271 --> 00:21:23.801
I thought maybe I could drive you home, but you didn't come out.

343
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:28.011
Joon. Hoon Seok's shadow is gone now.

344
00:21:29.511 --> 00:21:32.541
Isn't that great news? I guess his surgery will go well.

345
00:21:32.912 --> 00:21:37.251
Isn't it great that he didn't die like a heroine in a tragic story?

346
00:21:37.652 --> 00:21:41.622
It's an illness that doesn't suit that fatty in the first place.

347
00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:47.832
Everyone seems safe and fine now.

348
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:51.332
I'm so relieved.

349
00:21:55.201 --> 00:21:56.372
Let's go, Joon.

350
00:21:57.271 --> 00:21:58.872
But you're not fine.

351
00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:03.072
Did...

352
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:05.882
Did you hear it?

353
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:09.112
Yes.

354
00:22:12.682 --> 00:22:14.021
If you want to cry, go ahead.

355
00:23:02.402 --> 00:23:05.402
Hey. How long do I have to stay here?

356
00:23:05.402 --> 00:23:08.211
It's tiring to act like I'm sick. Get me out of here.

357
00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:12.642
Gosh, I'm bored.

358
00:23:15.412 --> 00:23:16.412
("Rat")

359
00:23:20.652 --> 00:23:23.322
This is the script of the new drama I'll be filming, right? "Rat"?

360
00:23:26.862 --> 00:23:30.932
You can't leave tonight. They can discharge you tomorrow afternoon.

361
00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:34.771
Do you remember the girl who tried to die at the broadcasting station?

362
00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:36.602
- What about it? - Get me her script.

363
00:23:36.602 --> 00:23:39.801
(Case report)

364
00:23:42.342 --> 00:23:43.912
Gosh, you brat.

365
00:23:43.912 --> 00:23:45.741
I told you not to pick your nose at work.

366
00:23:46.412 --> 00:23:49.011
Sorry? I don't pick my nose now.

367
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:50.882
What is this then? Isn't this blood from your nose?

368
00:23:51.352 --> 00:23:54.822
Oh, that picture was under Moo Gang's desk.

369
00:23:54.822 --> 00:23:57.122
- I picked it up and attached it. - Is that so?

370
00:23:58.221 --> 00:24:01.191
That brat kept the evidence without telling me.

371
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:04.102
So this means...

372
00:24:05.231 --> 00:24:06.872
the man who killed Han Jin Sook...

373
00:24:06.872 --> 00:24:10.001
may be the same person who killed Clara 20 years ago.

374
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:13.572
If Woo Byung Sik really killed Han Jin Sook,

375
00:24:14.872 --> 00:24:17.941
he could have killed Clara 20 years ago too...

376
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:21.711
since his body we found was a fake then.

377
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:30.622
- Hello? - Hi. This is the watch expert.

378
00:24:30.691 --> 00:24:35.791
I checked the parts. It's certain that Schneider made it himself,

379
00:24:35.791 --> 00:24:38.102
but a number was written on it.

380
00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:39.662
What? A number?

381
00:24:39.662 --> 00:24:41.301
Yes. Number two.

382
00:24:41.602 --> 00:24:45.142
I've never seen a part made by Schneider that had a number on it.

383
00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:49.572
If it's number two, I thought maybe there is a same watch somewhere.

384
00:24:49.572 --> 00:24:52.182
But you said that watch craftsman or whatever...

385
00:24:52.182 --> 00:24:55.281
makes only one watch with the same design.

386
00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:57.521
Yes. That's what I heard.

387
00:24:57.951 --> 00:25:00.691
It may not have the same design.

388
00:25:01.021 --> 00:25:03.521
Okay, I see. Thank you.

389
00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:05.521
- This is so confusing. - Crazy Dog.

390
00:25:06.791 --> 00:25:08.132
It's not Woo Byung Sik.

391
00:25:08.362 --> 00:25:10.562
The person who killed Han Jin Sook isn't Woo Byung Sik.

392
00:25:10.562 --> 00:25:13.332
I'm confused as it is. What are you talking about now?

393
00:25:13.332 --> 00:25:15.372
Look at this. Here.

394
00:25:15.701 --> 00:25:17.842
- Can you see it? "September 14"? - Yes.

395
00:25:17.842 --> 00:25:20.842
- He was in the Philippines then, - What?

396
00:25:21.072 --> 00:25:23.781
but the date on the security camera footage of Han Jin Sook is also...

397
00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:25.882
- September 14. - That's right.

398
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:30.781
He couldn't have been in two different countries on the same day.

399
00:25:30.781 --> 00:25:34.422
The man with the watch Jin Sook met on that day wasn't him.

400
00:25:34.951 --> 00:25:36.251
It means there is another man.

401
00:25:39.221 --> 00:25:41.432
Because of this and what happened to Sang Min,

402
00:25:41.432 --> 00:25:44.862
the netizens are boycotting our products.

403
00:25:44.862 --> 00:25:46.432
It looks quite serious.

404
00:25:46.872 --> 00:25:48.872
You should stop the construction and open a press conference.

405
00:25:48.872 --> 00:25:50.701
Royeol Complex Shopping Mall...

406
00:25:51.142 --> 00:25:53.271
is a business I'm leading.

407
00:25:53.372 --> 00:25:54.941
If I give up here,

408
00:25:55.211 --> 00:25:58.211
the board of directors will drag me down by any means.

409
00:25:58.211 --> 00:26:01.852
If they build a mall on this unstable land...

410
00:26:01.912 --> 00:26:03.951
Until my dad dies,

411
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:06.382
- I shouldn't get on their nerves. - The same disaster can't...

412
00:26:06.682 --> 00:26:08.152
- Just buy me time. - happen again.

413
00:26:08.152 --> 00:26:10.362
- I strongly hope it won't. - If this blows over,

414
00:26:11.261 --> 00:26:12.721
- Please. - resume the construction.

415
00:26:17.761 --> 00:26:20.731
My gosh. Here comes the big hero.

416
00:26:21.172 --> 00:26:23.432
You're saving humans' lives out in the open now.

417
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:25.801
How are you going to deal with it later?

418
00:26:27.142 --> 00:26:28.672
I had no choice.

419
00:26:29.241 --> 00:26:31.441
Ha Ram was looking at me.

420
00:26:31.441 --> 00:26:33.441
If I hadn't saved them, she would've suspected me.

421
00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:36.412
That's such a lame excuse.

422
00:26:36.481 --> 00:26:37.781
I really...

423
00:26:41.652 --> 00:26:43.592
What happened to you?

424
00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:45.961
Why did you change your looks?

425
00:26:46.392 --> 00:26:49.062
You liked your old face. You kept it for a while.

426
00:26:49.362 --> 00:26:52.531
Doesn't it have some swag in it? Some impact.

427
00:26:54.332 --> 00:26:56.672
Since when did you like teenagers?

428
00:26:58.142 --> 00:27:00.511
It's not a unique face either.

429
00:27:00.872 --> 00:27:02.711
It's not something you'd like.

430
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:06.882
This is a unique face. I absolutely love it.

431
00:27:06.882 --> 00:27:08.912
How dare you raise your voice at me?

432
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:15.521
You brat.

433
00:27:15.521 --> 00:27:17.961
Oh, right. Let me ask you something.

434
00:27:18.822 --> 00:27:22.592
- What... What? - Can we really have a human's face?

435
00:27:23.031 --> 00:27:25.402
My face isn't... No.

436
00:27:25.402 --> 00:27:28.231
This isn't a human's face. It really isn't.

437
00:27:28.231 --> 00:27:29.872
What are you saying? I wasn't talking about you.

438
00:27:30.402 --> 00:27:31.602
I meant 419.

439
00:27:32.072 --> 00:27:34.872
419? Isn't that your former partner?

440
00:27:34.941 --> 00:27:38.842
That's right. Do you remember the face he had on his last duty?

441
00:27:40.142 --> 00:27:43.451
It looked exactly like that human's face that Crazy Dog showed me.

442
00:27:47.592 --> 00:27:49.491
Hey, what are you doing?

443
00:27:51.521 --> 00:27:54.362
What? Well,

444
00:27:55.362 --> 00:27:56.662
About that...

445
00:27:57.201 --> 00:28:00.672
We cannot have the face of a real human.

446
00:28:00.902 --> 00:28:02.971
It's our rule. Have you forgotten?

447
00:28:02.971 --> 00:28:06.771
- Right? - Yes. You just saw a similar face.

448
00:28:06.872 --> 00:28:09.011
Those who make us our faces...

449
00:28:09.011 --> 00:28:11.041
look at real humans' faces as reference.

450
00:28:11.342 --> 00:28:13.781
I'm sure there are a few similar faces.

451
00:28:14.781 --> 00:28:17.922
Yes, yes. All right. That must be it.

452
00:28:18.352 --> 00:28:20.182
Yes. You're right.

453
00:28:20.451 --> 00:28:22.422
I'm sure it was just a similar face.

454
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.191
That's right.

455
00:28:25.221 --> 00:28:26.362
I'm tired.

456
00:28:26.892 --> 00:28:28.231
Go in early today.

457
00:28:31.602 --> 00:28:33.301
It's so hard to act.

458
00:28:33.701 --> 00:28:34.872
You little...

459
00:28:34.872 --> 00:28:38.041
By the way, why are you still dawdling here?

460
00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:41.441
Go back to the underworld if you got your body and memories back.

461
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:45.011
If Black gets his body and memories back,

462
00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:47.152
I'll leave with him.

463
00:28:47.211 --> 00:28:49.382
"I'll leave with him." My goodness.

464
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:53.221
What do you like so much about that rude brat?

465
00:29:02.092 --> 00:29:04.031
Is that the only reason?

466
00:29:06.562 --> 00:29:07.632
What do you mean?

467
00:29:07.872 --> 00:29:10.441
Did you really save other humans...

468
00:29:11.201 --> 00:29:13.541
because you were worried that the girl might find out?

469
00:29:16.941 --> 00:29:18.041
To be honest,

470
00:29:21.281 --> 00:29:24.582
the children were looking at me over the window.

471
00:29:27.152 --> 00:29:28.592
I couldn't turn away from them.

472
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.489
Stop drinking. You can't even drink that much.

473
00:29:47.489 --> 00:29:49.219
How can you be drinking again after all that trouble?

474
00:29:49.219 --> 00:29:50.660
My dear Sip Gyeon...

475
00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:53.060
(Ms. Fortune-teller)

476
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.769
Hello?

477
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.810
He doesn't have anywhere to go right now. Could he stay here for...

478
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:07.939
No.

479
00:30:09.539 --> 00:30:10.979
There is no choice then.

480
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.150
I should take him to my place.

481
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.420
What? Where? Are you crazy?

482
00:30:16.749 --> 00:30:18.550
Please let him stay with you for a few days.

483
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.489
Mr. Oh.

484
00:30:26.459 --> 00:30:27.759
Mr. Oh, wake up.

485
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.499
That punk.

486
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:34.100
You fool. Why did you let a human stay in your house?

487
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.699
What else could I do? Ha Ram said she'd take him to her place.

488
00:30:36.699 --> 00:30:38.810
Whether he stays with her or lives with her, just leave them.

489
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.209
Are you crazy? I'd never... What are you talking about?

490
00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:47.519
If a human stays here, it'd be inconvenient for us.

491
00:30:47.519 --> 00:30:50.050
We can't come and go freely as we want.

492
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.719
He can't even see you anyway.

493
00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.219
But when we talk,

494
00:30:55.219 --> 00:30:58.189
this young gentleman will think it's strange.

495
00:30:58.189 --> 00:31:01.130
Gentleman, my foot. Forget it then.

496
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.130
I can understand him.

497
00:31:03.459 --> 00:31:06.800
He wouldn't want to let someone so handsome stay in Ha Ram's place.

("The Disaster of Royeol")

499
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.820
Hi, Ha Ram.

500
00:31:27.019 --> 00:31:28.459
Did Mr. Oh wake up?

501
00:31:28.759 --> 00:31:31.729
He's not eating anything, right? Should I bring over some porridge?

502
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.400
He's eating fine, so mind your own business!

503
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.670
He's not her boss anymore, but she still cares about him.

504
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:46.509
It's so nice that people deliver fried chicken 24 hours a day.

505
00:31:46.769 --> 00:31:49.880
Fried chicken is the best for hangover.

506
00:31:51.749 --> 00:31:53.249
Can I order one more?

507
00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:55.620
What?

508
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.420
You're such a big sponger. Get out.

509
00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:04.590
Get out now!

510
00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:07.029
- What? - You piece of trash.

511
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:08.860
I can't stand you anymore, so get out of here.

512
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:10.499
Go. Leave.

513
00:32:10.499 --> 00:32:11.630
My gosh.

514
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.699
- Hurry up, and leave. - My goodness.

515
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.870
You're making me feel upset.

516
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.570
I thought we'd be able to...

517
00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.239
use this chance to become close.

518
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:22.610
I don't even have anywhere to go.

519
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.949
I guess I should go to Ms. Fortune-teller's house.

520
00:32:28.979 --> 00:32:29.979
What?

521
00:32:29.979 --> 00:32:32.590
Where do you think you're going?

522
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:33.660
Ms. Fortune-teller...

523
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.360
You... You can order more. Order as much as you want.

524
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.330
You can order everything on the menu.

525
00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.959
Like you said, we're friends, right?

526
00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:43.999
So let's stick next to each other...

527
00:32:43.999 --> 00:32:46.499
and be friends for a really long time.

528
00:32:46.499 --> 00:32:48.039
Go ahead, and order more.

529
00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:51.370
I've thought about it after you visited last time,

530
00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.769
and something came to my mind.

531
00:32:52.769 --> 00:32:53.810
What is it?

532
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.580
I don't know if it's her friend.

533
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.610
But Jin Sook once had to go to a hospital because...

534
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.519
she had gotten into an accident on her way home.

535
00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:03.550
And she started getting angry at me as soon as she came home.

536
00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.719
"She looks exactly the same as when she was young."

537
00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:08.220
"I aged so much because I ended up getting married to you."

538
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.990
That's what she said to me.

539
00:33:10.119 --> 00:33:12.090
I recalled having fought with her back then.

540
00:33:13.959 --> 00:33:15.760
- An accident? - Yes.

541
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.170
Which hospital did she go to?

542
00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:18.729
It was Royeol Hospital.

543
00:33:19.869 --> 00:33:22.470
There was a patient who came in because of a minor collision.

544
00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.639
I signed her up for an insurance because I felt sorry for her.

545
00:33:25.639 --> 00:33:26.939
Could it be...

546
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.579
Hey, So Tae. Detective Park.

547
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.880
My gosh, where is everyone?

555
00:34:37.079 --> 00:34:39.180
Ms. Yoon, are you inside?

556
00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.220
Ms. Yoon Soo Wan?

557
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.720
Ms. Yoon, are you home?

558
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.959
A detective will visit you. Don't meet him.

559
00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.760
Ms. Yoon.

560
00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:57.329
Ms. Yoon, are you inside?

561
00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:09.539
Doctor Yoon doesn't work here anymore.

562
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.820
Hey, So Tae. Remember Hwang Mi Ja from Santorini?

563
00:35:16.479 --> 00:35:19.490
Give me her home address via text. Okay.

564
00:35:26.389 --> 00:35:27.459
What's this?

565
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.499
I went grocery shopping to cook something for Mr. Oh.

566
00:35:30.499 --> 00:35:32.229
What? He's not here right now.

567
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.999
Really? Where did he go?

568
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.110
I don't know. He was gone when I came out of the shower.

569
00:35:38.869 --> 00:35:40.439
He even wore my clothes.

570
00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:41.809
That black suit?

571
00:35:41.809 --> 00:35:43.849
Gosh, I only have that one suit.

572
00:35:43.849 --> 00:35:45.550
What a beggar.

573
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.519
He probably doesn't even have anywhere to go.

574
00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:53.050
The person you have reached is not available. Please leave...

575
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.720
He's not picking up.

576
00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.159
You don't think...

577
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.400
he'll do anything drastic, do you?

578
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.059
Don't worry. He's not going to die.

579
00:36:03.059 --> 00:36:05.829
My gosh, how can you be so sure?

580
00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:08.369
You don't even have the ability to see shadows like me.

581
00:36:08.939 --> 00:36:10.670
You're right. I don't.

582
00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.840
But anyway, he'll be fine.

583
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.579
If he wore that dark suit,

584
00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.309
he might've gone to see Sip Gyeon.

585
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.019
I'll go now.

586
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.990
My gosh, that boss of hers is such a pain.

587
00:36:28.959 --> 00:36:30.019
Wait for me!

588
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:43.300
What brings you all the way to my house?

589
00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.110
Is she Kim Sun Young?

590
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.780
No.

591
00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.209
Look carefully.

592
00:36:55.619 --> 00:36:58.450
Fine, Sun Young. Stick next to Han Moo Gang,

593
00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.760
and find that videotape no matter what.

594
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.490
This is a photo from 20 years ago.

595
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.860
The photo has a low definition because my phone's old.

596
00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:08.499
It's not her.

597
00:37:08.499 --> 00:37:11.670
She looks completely different.

598
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.400
Are you sure?

599
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.380
Okay. If you recall any memories about Kim Sun Young,

600
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.249
call me right away. Okay?

601
00:37:24.249 --> 00:37:25.650
Okay.

602
00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.760
If you ever try to escape again,

603
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.930
- Where did he put it? - not only will you die,

604
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.030
but Han Moo Gang will die as well.

Put that away.

657
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:09.260
What's wrong? You love noodle soup with red beans.

658
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:12.400
Here. Try some.

659
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.470
I told you to put that away!

660
00:42:17.439 --> 00:42:18.639
Gosh, it's hot.

661
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.709
Han Moo Gang, this jerk.

662
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.749
Why does his favorite food have to be red beans?

663
00:42:28.619 --> 00:42:30.720
I have no use of for him at all.

664
00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:35.920
My gosh, it's hot.

665
00:42:40.999 --> 00:42:42.030
Let me see.

666
00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:44.030
It's okay.

667
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:48.700
I just fell.

668
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.209
Why is she lying?

669
00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:55.680
This kind of scar comes from torture.

670
00:42:55.809 --> 00:42:58.680
I'm fine. I didn't get burned that much.

671
00:43:10.189 --> 00:43:11.760
Does this really help?

672
00:43:17.869 --> 00:43:18.869
Why?

673
00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:21.539
Does it hurt more?

674
00:43:22.269 --> 00:43:24.570
I heard that cold water helps.

675
00:43:29.479 --> 00:43:30.880
I'm sorry, Moo Gang.

676
00:43:34.119 --> 00:43:36.950
Joon, did Mr. Oh come home yet?

677
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.189
Hello.

678
00:43:43.189 --> 00:43:45.990
I... I came in because the front gate was open. I'm sorry.

679
00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:48.599
I'll... I'll go now.

680
00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:50.470
"Joon"?

681
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:54.039
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

682
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.070
"Joon"?

683
00:43:57.809 --> 00:44:00.280
Why is she calling you Joon?

684
00:44:02.409 --> 00:44:03.550
Did you...

685
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.749
also know that I had an older brother?

686
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:09.150
Do you...

687
00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.320
remember everything now?

688
00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.519
No.

689
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.860
Then how did you find out?

690
00:44:33.579 --> 00:44:34.909
I saw this and asked Moo Gang's...

691
00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:36.610
No.

692
00:44:37.479 --> 00:44:39.809
I asked my mom about this. Why?

693
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:44.420
But why is she calling you Joon?

694
00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:52.559
Well...

695
00:44:54.499 --> 00:44:57.570
Well, I really need her help for an investigation.

696
00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:00.400
She's helping me because she thinks I'm her hometown friend, Joon.

697
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.099
And I'm pretending to be him.

698
00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.110
So you can never tell her that...

699
00:45:06.369 --> 00:45:08.039
I'm not Joon. Do you understand?

700
00:45:09.909 --> 00:45:13.280
- But... - Just keep that in mind, okay?

701
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.550
Okay.

702
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.189
I won't say anything.

703
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:26.130
I'll go now.

704
00:45:34.099 --> 00:45:35.639
I hope that doctor...

705
00:45:37.209 --> 00:45:38.769
doesn't say anything.

706
00:45:48.019 --> 00:45:49.450
Hey, Ms. Fortune-teller.

707
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:07.570
You lost so much weight.

708
00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.309
I hope drinking this will help you regain your energy.

709
00:46:12.709 --> 00:46:15.180
It's already giving me a lot of strength since you made it for me.

710
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:20.079
Where did you go without even saying anything?

711
00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.019
- I got a job. - You got a job?

712
00:46:23.619 --> 00:46:24.619
Here.

713
00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:26.990
What's this?

714
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:28.959
I'm an insurance planner now.

715
00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.389
I got a license for that when I used to be the CEO of Royeol Insurance.

716
00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:33.829
I'm a freelance insurance planner.

717
00:46:33.959 --> 00:46:37.200
I have flexible working hours, and I get paid solely based on my results.

718
00:46:37.369 --> 00:46:40.340
But I have great talking skills, and I'm very good looking.

719
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.099
I also look good in this suit.

720
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.709
Why did you suddenly become an insurance planner?

721
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.340
My dad also started out as an insurance agent.

722
00:46:48.439 --> 00:46:51.809
I'm going to achieve everything step by step...

723
00:46:52.079 --> 00:46:53.309
just like my dad.

724
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.180
You just watch. I'm going to become the most popular insurance planner.

725
00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.519
Then in the future,

726
00:46:57.519 --> 00:47:00.320
I'm going to build a company as big as Royeol Insurance.

727
00:47:02.789 --> 00:47:05.389
How's your father doing?

728
00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.200
He's become a lot better.

729
00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:10.329
That's a relief.

730
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.400
My dad became like that...

731
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.070
because of me.

732
00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:20.340
What?

733
00:47:21.139 --> 00:47:23.039
- Why? - My family used to...

734
00:47:23.039 --> 00:47:24.849
treat me like I didn't even exist.

735
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.019
My only friend was Sip Gyeon and my computer.

736
00:47:30.019 --> 00:47:34.619
But as I grew older, I wanted to let my family know that I existed.

737
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.420
I was too immature back then.

738
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.059
I thought they'd acknowledge my existence...

739
00:47:39.059 --> 00:47:40.599
if I got myself in trouble.

740
00:47:40.599 --> 00:47:43.729
I thought that would grab their attention.

741
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.970
So I hacked into Royeol Group's security system.

742
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.970
Then my older brother sued me.

743
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:58.010
My dad even begged to my brother on his knees, but it was useless.

744
00:47:58.479 --> 00:48:00.550
I became an ex-convict because of that,

745
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.780
so my dad got shocked and collapsed.

746
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:05.650
He's been bedridden ever since.

747
00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:18.090
Leo! Leo!

748
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.659
- Hey, what's wrong? - He surprised me.

749
00:49:20.659 --> 00:49:22.229
- Hey! Leo! - He suddenly fainted.

750
00:49:22.229 --> 00:49:24.829
- Here. - Thank you.

751
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:27.840
Leo, wake up! Leo, wake up.

752
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:29.740
Wake up.

753
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.479
I should've killed him back then.

754
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:39.349
Excuse me.

755
00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:40.820
Okay.

756
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:46.450
Leo, how do you feel?

757
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.459
You're going to be shooting soon. You should take care of your health.

758
00:49:50.459 --> 00:49:54.030
I saw the main concept and ending of this drama somewhere else.

759
00:49:54.499 --> 00:49:55.630
What are you talking about?

760
00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.400
("Mouse")

761
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.769
You know what that is, right?

762
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:05.740
It's just a coincidence.

763
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.439
There are so many similar stories these days.

764
00:50:07.939 --> 00:50:09.979
You practically copied the entire thing.

765
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:12.650
All you did is change the genre.

766
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:16.720
Don't worry. We just used the main concept. That's not plagiarism.

767
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.920
Then what about the writer?

768
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.320
Don't worry about her.

769
00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.490
We spread rumors that she's insane.

770
00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:26.930
So no one's going to believe what she says.

771
00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:29.030
What a bunch of thieves.

772
00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:30.869
You'd rather be better off stealing something.

773
00:50:30.869 --> 00:50:32.170
You little jerk.

774
00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:34.769
You're not even a great actor.

775
00:50:34.769 --> 00:50:37.269
You have nothing to be proud of apart from your pretty face.

776
00:50:37.269 --> 00:50:39.070
- You piece of trash. - My gosh, stop!

777
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.840
That's enough. He's a patient. Please let go of him.

778
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.409
- Let me go. - I said, let go of him.

779
00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:49.519
- You jerk. - Let me go!

780
00:50:53.249 --> 00:50:54.619
You punk.

781
00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.700
(You'll end up regretting your past deeds to the bone.)

782
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.099
(I'll make you fall into the fiery pit, so brace yourself.)

783
00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:12.039
What?

784
00:51:12.439 --> 00:51:15.240
Is there someone else other than me who's after Leo?

785
00:51:15.579 --> 00:51:16.880
Is it a stalker?

786
00:51:18.209 --> 00:51:21.650
This might make things easier for me.

787
00:51:26.689 --> 00:51:29.860
Oh Man Ho, you must've hid it well.

788
00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.030
I'm sure there's evidence to prove that he got bribed.

789
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:37.329
Please find a document for me.

790
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:41.039
It's a document under Chunsu Insurance from 20 years ago.

791
00:51:41.999 --> 00:51:43.070
What?

792
00:51:43.369 --> 00:51:46.979
They said they didn't have any documents from 1997.

793
00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:49.110
That means they got rid of it.

794
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:53.180
Chunsu Insurance's written documents are kept in the storage room.

795
00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.479
So the files from 1997 could still be there.

796
00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:58.420
Yes, that's right. Mr. Hwang told me that the documents from 1997...

797
00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.459
are still kept in the storage room.

798
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:06.229
Hello, Mr. Hwang. It's me, Oh Man Soo.

799
00:52:07.559 --> 00:52:08.959
Leo!

800
00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:15.840
What happened to your face? Did you have a fight or something?

801
00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.909
No, it's nothing.

802
00:52:18.709 --> 00:52:20.780
I'll also be in Director Shin's drama.

803
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.479
As soon as I heard that you'd be my co-star,

804
00:52:23.479 --> 00:52:26.510
I signed the contract without even negotiating my pay.

805
00:52:26.579 --> 00:52:28.249
You'll be the female lead?

806
00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.289
How did you get that role?

807
00:52:31.249 --> 00:52:32.749
Did you find yourself a backer or what?

808
00:52:33.619 --> 00:52:35.760
Don't call him like that.

809
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:38.630
He's my lover.

810
00:52:40.159 --> 00:52:41.430
Shall I tell you who it is?

811
00:52:43.459 --> 00:52:44.970
He's...

812
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.470
Gosh. What was that about?

813
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:51.709
I'll see you at the read-through.

814
00:53:02.849 --> 00:53:04.019
Goodness.

815
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:08.260
- Hey. - Hey, where are you now?

816
00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.119
The CEO is outraged right now.

817
00:53:10.119 --> 00:53:11.689
Come home immediately.

818
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.059
You called a chauffeur, right?

819
00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:17.400
Of course.

I got confused because she has the exact same car.

I got the exact same model as yours.

Oh, right.

853

You asked me for the documents from 1997 stored in the warehouse.

I need to look into something.

You haven't told anyone about this, right?

859

Gosh, of course not.

860

All the documents from Chunsu Insurance...

are missing data from 1997.

862

Do you know anything about it?

863
00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:31.170
I think that's when things started happening for Chunsu Insurance.

864
00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.999
Even just reminiscing that time puts me in a great mood.

865

That was my second year at the company,

866

but I got a lot of bonus that year.

What position did my brother have back then?

868
00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:42.340
He and I joined the company in the same year.

869
00:55:42.579 --> 00:55:44.249
Oh, right. Was it that summer?

870
00:55:44.249 --> 00:55:47.019
He got promoted to the director position.

871
00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:49.320

872
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.849
making all the important decisions.

873
00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:54.920
He's been the one holding the reign since then.

Oh, really?

875
00:55:56.289 --> 00:55:58.389
Mr. President told us in the past...

876
00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:00.329
that he'd make his sons...

877

work just like us normal employees.

878
00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:06.099
But he changed his words in less than two years after saying that,

879
00:56:06.099 --> 00:56:08.400
so all of us were very flustered.

Gosh, what is this mess?

884

Something must've happened in 1997.

but when I arrived, the car was gone.

983
01:02:09.385 --> 01:02:11.555
- What? - The car already left.

984
01:02:11.555 --> 01:02:13.796
It's not him. It was someone else.

985
01:02:14.926 --> 01:02:16.655
Before we parted last night...

986
01:02:18.066 --> 01:02:19.495
Did you bring it already?

987
01:02:19.495 --> 01:02:21.336
This is Mi So's car.

988
01:02:21.336 --> 01:02:23.296
Your car is over there.

989
01:02:25.106 --> 01:02:26.765
I was confused because it's the same car.

990
01:02:26.975 --> 01:02:28.135
He was wearing a black cap.

991
01:02:28.635 --> 01:02:30.035
A black cap.

992
01:02:30.606 --> 01:02:34.015
His hand was bandaged. Did you see his face?

993
01:02:34.015 --> 01:02:35.716
It was too dark.

994
01:02:39.515 --> 01:02:40.756
Is that so?

995
01:02:41.885 --> 01:02:43.086
On his face...

996
01:02:50.865 --> 01:02:52.026
Are you okay?

997
01:02:53.325 --> 01:02:54.666
I'm sorry.

998
01:02:55.265 --> 01:02:56.635
I'm sorry.

999
01:02:59.635 --> 01:03:02.435
Don't try to change people's fate carelessly.

1000
01:03:03.236 --> 01:03:04.805
He had a scar on the face.

1001
01:03:05.475 --> 01:03:08.115
- A scar? - On his right cheek.

1002
01:03:25.126 --> 01:03:26.566
(You will regret what you've done.)

1003
01:03:28.296 --> 01:03:29.595
What do you mean?

1004
01:03:30.205 --> 01:03:33.805
You won't be able to bear the consequence.

1005
01:03:34.435 --> 01:03:35.905
Remember what I said.

1006
01:03:43.816 --> 01:03:45.885
What was that? How uncomfortable.

1007
01:03:45.986 --> 01:03:48.055
Do you remember anything else?

1008
01:03:56.555 --> 01:03:57.926
It was him.

1009
01:03:59.066 --> 01:04:01.265
Who do you mean?

1010
01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:06.265
It's the same way that he killed the woman.

1011
01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:25.325
Actress Lee Mi So was found dead in her car.

1012
01:04:25.325 --> 01:04:27.756
According to a witness, the suspect's hand was bandaged.

1013
01:04:27.756 --> 01:04:30.796
- Lee Mi So? - He has a scar on his face.

1014
01:04:31.426 --> 01:04:32.725
A scar?

1015
01:04:32.725 --> 01:04:34.066
What happened?

1016
01:04:34.495 --> 01:04:35.666
No way.

1017
01:04:35.765 --> 01:04:38.006
Many people have scars on their face.

1018
01:04:39.106 --> 01:04:41.805
Don't try to change people's fate carelessly.

1019
01:04:42.006 --> 01:04:43.276
Remember what I said.

1020
01:04:43.506 --> 01:04:47.146
You won't be able to bear the consequence.

1021
01:04:47.876 --> 01:04:48.946
It can't be him.

1022
01:04:51.716 --> 01:04:53.486
(The suspect is presumed to have a scar on his face.)

1023
01:04:57.825 --> 01:04:59.185
A scar?

1024
01:05:02.926 --> 01:05:04.526
Long time no see, Kim Sun Young.

1025
01:05:57.816 --> 01:05:59.845
Help me over here. Over here!

1026
01:05:59.845 --> 01:06:01.685
- Are you okay? - There are children inside.

1027
01:06:01.685 --> 01:06:02.816
Get out of the way.

1028
01:06:14.935 --> 01:06:17.006
No. No.

1029
01:06:18.535 --> 01:06:19.735
I'll kill you.

1030
01:06:22.376 --> 01:06:23.575
I'll kill you.

1031
01:06:25.405 --> 01:06:27.075
Which woman are you talking about?

1032
01:06:28.016 --> 01:06:29.575
Who do you mean?

1033
01:06:30.985 --> 01:06:32.445
Do you mean Han Jin Sook?

1034
01:06:34.315 --> 01:06:35.386
No.

1035
01:06:35.855 --> 01:06:37.186
The director of the mental hospital.

1036
01:06:59.575 --> 01:07:00.916
Be quiet.

1037
01:07:02.945 --> 01:07:04.186
Be quiet.

1038
01:07:04.916 --> 01:07:06.216
Be quiet!

1039
01:07:13.186 --> 01:07:15.726
I told you to be quiet.

1040
01:07:16.296 --> 01:07:18.166
Be quiet!

1041
01:07:23.836 --> 01:07:26.166
He enjoys killing people.

1042
01:07:49.726 --> 01:07:51.096
(Black)

1043
01:07:51.565 --> 01:07:54.096
He has a scar on his face. It's him.

1044
01:07:54.096 --> 01:07:56.535
He could be killing someone else right now.

1045
01:07:56.636 --> 01:07:58.936
It was done by that doctor.

1046
01:07:58.936 --> 01:07:59.966
No way.

1047
01:07:59.966 --> 01:08:02.905
We could have stopped it if we found out sooner.

1048
01:08:03.136 --> 01:08:06.205
Moo Gang isn't Joon.

1049
01:08:06.205 --> 01:08:07.645
That can't be.

1050
01:08:07.645 --> 01:08:09.716
If you continue, you might die.

1051
01:08:09.716 --> 01:08:11.115
My Joon.

1052
01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:13.985
Is he really dead?
