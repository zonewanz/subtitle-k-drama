3
00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.178
What was that?

4
00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:18.348
You almost cracked your head open.

5
00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.019
That's why you should've listened.

6
00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:24.458
Fine.

7
00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:30.958
Do you want to go get something to eat?

8
00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.668
What do you want to eat?

9
00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:39.568
Steamed buns?

10
00:00:50.178 --> 00:00:51.579
It isn't monsoon season.

11
00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.218
Why is it raining so much in the fall?

12
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:55.589
I know.

13
00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:02.629
Thanks,

14
00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:05.099
Jung Hee.

15
00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:08.369
For coming to get me.

16
00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:11.239
This is friendship.

17
00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:15.438
You're on probation because of me after all.

18
00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.138
I'm a girl of loyalty.

19
00:01:23.278 --> 00:01:26.349
You look better with the tape on your glasses.

20
00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:27.819
It looks fashionable.

21
00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:29.688
Really?

22
00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:31.959
Do you think it'll become a trend?

23
00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:33.888
A little?

24
00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:35.559
A little?

25
00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.819
What was that?

26
00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:08.028
Sorry.

27
00:02:10.098 --> 00:02:11.429
That hurts.

28
00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:13.899
- Hey. - Let go. That hurts.

29
00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:14.968
That hurts.

30
00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:19.139
What?

31
00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.839
What is it? Let go.

32
00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:38.288
What did you say?

33
00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:41.959
Must you...

34
00:02:43.758 --> 00:02:45.299
Must you do this?

35
00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:48.128
How can I live without you?

36
00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:50.869
Of course you can live.

37
00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:53.239
You'll be fine.

38
00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:56.239
Thank you for everything.

39
00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.278
You were nice to a nobody like me.

40
00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:00.309
No.

41
00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.149
Do Ha.

42
00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.848
Please be good to your wife.

43
00:03:07.848 --> 00:03:09.818
You should forget about me.

44
00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:27.739
Jung Hee.

45
00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:30.579
Are you all right?

46
00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:34.579
Jung Hee.

47
00:03:39.778 --> 00:03:41.688
- Happy? - Don't hit Jung Hee!

48
00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.489
Stop it!

49
00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.688
Jung Hee, how is your mom's hand?

50
00:03:47.688 --> 00:03:49.989
Mom, did you hurt your hand?

51
00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.728
What are you saying? Are you sleeping?

52
00:03:56.998 --> 00:03:58.299
How...

53
00:03:59.568 --> 00:04:01.438
Hey, Jung Hee.

54
00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:04.408
This is my guess.

55
00:04:04.408 --> 00:04:06.679
Adults must have...

56
00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.149
lives of their own.

57
00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:13.149
They can't control their feelings either.

58
00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:14.549
Their own lives?

59
00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.518
They're always ordering us because they're adults.

60
00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:19.188
They stomp over us.

61
00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.429
I can't forgive him.

62
00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:24.099
Never!

63
00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:35.568
Drink some water.

64
00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.568
Do you have to pee?

65
00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.109
Why are you staring at the bedpan?

66
00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:11.708
Did you do something wrong again?

67
00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:16.409
I'm back.

68
00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:18.318
Did you get caught in the rain?

69
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.948
You should always take an umbrella.

70
00:05:19.948 --> 00:05:21.648
It was just a little bit.

71
00:05:22.648 --> 00:05:24.688
Jung Hee, were you out?

72
00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:30.429
What's wrong?

73
00:05:30.828 --> 00:05:33.029
Are you crazy?

74
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:36.029
Why are you looking at Do Ha like that?

75
00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.398
What a bother.

76
00:05:38.799 --> 00:05:40.138
Do Ha, let's go cook.

77
00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:41.638
Okay.

78
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:43.539
Auntie.

79
00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:45.838
Yes?

80
00:05:57.318 --> 00:06:00.729
Jung Hee, did something happen at school?

81
00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:03.859
Is it because of Jin?

82
00:06:03.859 --> 00:06:05.099
Auntie.

83
00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:15.669
I got yelled at school because of you...

84
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.609
for wearing this.

85
00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:22.078
Really? What do I do?

86
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:24.378
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:24.448 --> 00:06:27.119
I thought you wanted to wear it.

88
00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.258
Did they hit you? Did you have a drill?

89
00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.229
What about this?

90
00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:37.628
I asked you to alter it ages ago.

91
00:06:39.328 --> 00:06:40.529
What about this?

92
00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.739
You said you would wash this.

93
00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:46.698
What about this and this?

94
00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:51.138
I'm sorry, Jung Hee.

95
00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:53.008
There's a lot of work at the factory because...

96
00:06:53.008 --> 00:06:55.878
If you're not going to do work,

97
00:06:55.878 --> 00:06:57.719
go back to your home.

98
00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:04.018
I hate you.

99
00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.429
I'm sorry, Jung Hee.

100
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.208
Jung Hee.

101
00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:29.809
- Hae Joo. - Jung Hee.

102
00:07:29.878 --> 00:07:31.578
What happened?

103
00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:33.419
Why didn't you come to school?

104
00:07:35.018 --> 00:07:36.289
Hello.

105
00:07:37.188 --> 00:07:39.289
- Come to my room. - Jung Hee.

106
00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:40.888
Hey...

107
00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:44.458
Your father will be home in a while.

108
00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:46.398
- Mom. - Come on, Mom.

109
00:07:46.398 --> 00:07:47.398
Be quiet.

110
00:07:47.398 --> 00:07:48.799
I'll leave soon.

111
00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:50.799
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:56.878
Why did she come here with a kid on her back?

113
00:07:56.878 --> 00:07:59.378
Mom, don't be like that.

114
00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:01.349
Be quiet, you jerk.

115
00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:08.119
Jin's contact in Seoul?

116
00:08:09.818 --> 00:08:10.888
Actually,

117
00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:13.659
my dad...

118
00:08:14.688 --> 00:08:17.458
was arrested and is in Seoul.

119
00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:18.659
What?

120
00:08:20.128 --> 00:08:21.369
Why?

121
00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:23.698
He got involved in current state of affairs.

122
00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:26.498
I can't visit him.

123
00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:29.039
- It's frustrating. - Then...

124
00:08:29.768 --> 00:08:31.609
were you in Seoul all this time?

125
00:08:31.609 --> 00:08:32.608
Yes.

126
00:08:33.578 --> 00:08:36.779
I was asking around.

127
00:08:37.448 --> 00:08:40.649
I tried asking relatives for help, but...

128
00:08:45.118 --> 00:08:46.488
Why are you taking...

129
00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:48.828
Eng Cho around?

130
00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:54.368
Young Choon is also at the police station.

131
00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:58.269
There's no one to take care of her.

132
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:59.838
But, still...

133
00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.679
Hello.

134
00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:15.049
Shim Ae Sook.

135
00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.389
- You look pretty today. - Hey.

136
00:09:20.458 --> 00:09:21.988
What do you want me to do?

137
00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:23.598
What should I do...

138
00:09:23.799 --> 00:09:25.958
for them to release Young Choon?

139
00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:28.429
If I tell you,

140
00:09:29.328 --> 00:09:30.368
will you do it?

141
00:09:34.468 --> 00:09:36.879
Ae Sook. Both you and I...

142
00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:38.608
are nobodies.

143
00:09:39.338 --> 00:09:40.948
There's nothing we can do.

144
00:09:51.618 --> 00:09:52.988
You were alive?

145
00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:57.059
Because of your Dad's case,

146
00:09:57.358 --> 00:09:59.999
he had to find something to report to his superior.

147
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:03.468
Young Choon was unlucky.

148
00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:06.698
Because he helped your father,

149
00:10:07.568 --> 00:10:09.409
they call him a communist.

150
00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:10.938
Young Choon...

151
00:10:13.649 --> 00:10:15.578
only did what he did because I asked for help.

152
00:10:15.578 --> 00:10:17.318
Even if you say that, it won't help.

153
00:10:18.318 --> 00:10:19.448
They won't care.

154
00:10:20.118 --> 00:10:21.218
I don't know...

155
00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:23.149
anything more than that.

156
00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:30.698
Ae Sook.

157
00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:33.468
Thank you.

158
00:10:43.578 --> 00:10:45.179
I'll pick it up.

159
00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:48.978
This is Seongbuk-dong.

160
00:10:51.649 --> 00:10:52.718
Hello?

161
00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:55.618
Hello?

162
00:10:58.818 --> 00:10:59.889
Hello.

163
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.929
It's me. Jin.

164
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:12.468
I'm sorry I called you out of the blue.

165
00:11:12.499 --> 00:11:13.809
I thought...

166
00:11:15.938 --> 00:11:20.348
maybe you might be able to help me.

167
00:11:21.578 --> 00:11:24.379
Let's dance

168
00:11:24.749 --> 00:11:27.948
Before the night ends

169
00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:31.188
- Boogie woogie - Dad.

170
00:11:31.188 --> 00:11:32.919
Boogie woogie

171
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:35.659
Who is that?

172
00:11:36.858 --> 00:11:39.828
It's Jung Hee. Gosh, Jung Hee.

173
00:11:39.828 --> 00:11:41.399
My daughter, Jung Hee.

174
00:11:41.728 --> 00:11:43.468
My smart Jung Hee.

175
00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:47.909
- Gosh. - Sir.

176
00:11:47.909 --> 00:11:51.208
- Dad. - What, what, what?

177
00:11:51.309 --> 00:11:53.279
Do you want allowance?

178
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.448
Hold on.

179
00:11:54.848 --> 00:11:58.078
Let's see. Where's my wallet?

180
00:11:58.078 --> 00:11:59.249
Mom!

181
00:11:59.818 --> 00:12:01.289
Dad's home!

182
00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:03.688
Mom!

183
00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:06.488
I know, stupid girl.

184
00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:10.858
I can't find my wallet. Where did it go?

185
00:12:10.858 --> 00:12:12.029
Get up!

186
00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:14.228
- Who is this? - Get up.

187
00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:17.669
Who else would it be? Get up.

188
00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:20.438
I have to give Jung Hee some allowance.

189
00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:23.809
My goodness.

190
00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:24.909
Go inside.

191
00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:36.618
Jung Hee...

192
00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:41.889
- Hey, Duk Seon. - Hello.

193
00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:43.958
Your skirt keeps on getting shorter.

194
00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:47.568
Hae Joo.

195
00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:53.338
I'm sorry I missed so many classes, sir.

196
00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:59.438
Come to the office before we start class.

197
00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:00.749
Okay.

198
00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:04.318
It's Hae Joo!

199
00:13:04.448 --> 00:13:05.649
- Hae Joo! - Hae Joo!

200
00:13:05.649 --> 00:13:07.948
- Hey, keep it down! - Hello.

201
00:13:08.249 --> 00:13:10.818
Hey, where have you been?

202
00:13:10.818 --> 00:13:12.159
- We were worried. - Where were you?

203
00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:13.358
Are you okay?

204
00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:18.598
Hey.

205
00:13:19.728 --> 00:13:21.368
I heard about your father.

206
00:13:22.499 --> 00:13:23.968
You must be heartbroken.

207
00:13:25.669 --> 00:13:27.838
You must brace yourself at times like these.

208
00:13:30.478 --> 00:13:33.078
Stay focused, Park Hae Joo!

209
00:13:34.078 --> 00:13:37.249
Don't influence the other kids.

210
00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:39.118
- Do you understand? - Yes.

211
00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:52.858
- I was so annoyed. - Hello.

212
00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:54.899
Isn't that Jin?

213
00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:57.238
- Hello. - It really is Jin.

214
00:13:57.338 --> 00:13:58.999
What is he doing here?

215
00:13:59.568 --> 00:14:00.868
I'll get going first.

216
00:14:04.909 --> 00:14:05.938
Jin.

217
00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.149
Jung Hee, have you been well?

218
00:14:10.318 --> 00:14:11.718
You must be here to see Hae Joo.

219
00:14:12.379 --> 00:14:13.419
Yes.

220
00:14:14.348 --> 00:14:15.618
I also thought I should see you...

221
00:14:16.618 --> 00:14:18.389
I see Hae Joo coming.

222
00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:19.889
Hae Joo!

223
00:14:31.968 --> 00:14:33.238
Why did you come here?

224
00:14:33.368 --> 00:14:35.968
Eng Cho is doing fine.

225
00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:37.909
Eng Cho...

226
00:14:39.238 --> 00:14:42.049
will be taken away by an orphanage. Actually,

227
00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:45.649
she's not my real sister.

228
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:48.889
I kept her with me because she was homeless.

229
00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:53.059
I'll keep Eng Cho with me.

230
00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:55.429
- I can take care of her. - Why?

231
00:14:55.588 --> 00:14:57.328
You don't have anything to do with us.

232
00:14:58.499 --> 00:14:59.799
I told you before.

233
00:14:59.929 --> 00:15:03.368
You need to stay focused. Watch out for yourself.

234
00:15:06.068 --> 00:15:07.409
I'm finished.

235
00:15:08.468 --> 00:15:10.039
I'll wait for you, Young Choon.

236
00:15:22.348 --> 00:15:25.059
Hae Joo, did you meet him?

237
00:15:25.618 --> 00:15:27.328
How did Young Choon look?

238
00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:31.499
Hae Joo.

239
00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:51.848
You should get going.

240
00:15:52.448 --> 00:15:53.588
I'll go home too.

241
00:15:54.688 --> 00:15:56.019
Let's walk a little more.

242
00:15:57.019 --> 00:15:58.419
I'm okay.

243
00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:01.688
- You should go. - In a bit.

244
00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:03.698
Let's walk together.

245
00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:13.409
Dong Moon.

246
00:16:14.238 --> 00:16:15.568
Are you going to my place?

247
00:16:16.068 --> 00:16:18.108
Dong Moon, it's been a while.

248
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:19.578
Have you been well?

249
00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:23.779
- What are you doing here? - He came to see Hae Joo.

250
00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:25.049
I missed Jung Hee.

251
00:16:25.978 --> 00:16:29.789
No, it's not true. Hae Joo asked for his help.

252
00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:40.059
Then you can go after seeing Jung Hee.

253
00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:47.809
Dong Moon!

254
00:16:48.868 --> 00:16:49.938
Bae Dong Moon.

255
00:16:50.478 --> 00:16:51.838
He's still cute.

256
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:57.818
- Do you want to go now? - Yes.

257
00:16:58.818 --> 00:17:00.348
Take care on your way back home.

258
00:17:03.218 --> 00:17:06.118
Dong Moon! Wait for me.

259
00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:09.358
Why are you coming already?

260
00:17:09.828 --> 00:17:12.059
Didn't you miss him? You should talk with him.

261
00:17:12.128 --> 00:17:13.828
We talked enough already.

262
00:17:13.928 --> 00:17:15.898
Also, he's here to see Hae Joo.

263
00:17:15.928 --> 00:17:17.299
Hae Joo asked him for a favor.

264
00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:18.999
You know Young Choon from the pharmacy, right?

265
00:17:19.068 --> 00:17:22.509
He's arrested, but he couldn't get...

266
00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:23.539
Jung Hee.

267
00:17:23.979 --> 00:17:25.009
Yes?

268
00:17:25.809 --> 00:17:27.348
You don't have to make up excuses.

269
00:17:28.178 --> 00:17:30.578
It's not an excuse. It's the truth.

270
00:17:30.578 --> 00:17:33.019
Why would I make an excuse to you?

271
00:17:34.818 --> 00:17:35.888
That's true.

272
00:17:37.418 --> 00:17:39.588
We don't need excuses between us.

273
00:17:40.628 --> 00:17:41.759
I'll get going.

274
00:17:42.259 --> 00:17:44.898
Dong Moon! Bae Dong Moon!

275
00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:53.568
Are you home, Jung Hee?

276
00:17:55.368 --> 00:17:56.439
Jung Hee.

277
00:17:56.568 --> 00:17:59.039
Are you craving any dishes?

278
00:17:59.209 --> 00:18:00.378
If you want anything, I'll make it for you.

279
00:18:00.378 --> 00:18:01.848
I don't want anything.

280
00:18:02.309 --> 00:18:05.918
You like dried whitebait and pork jangjorim, right?

281
00:18:06.918 --> 00:18:08.049
Forget it.

282
00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:10.818
It's so busy I'm going to go crazy.

283
00:18:11.318 --> 00:18:13.559
Number three quit.

284
00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:15.189
Number three quit?

285
00:18:15.858 --> 00:18:17.459
- Why? - I don't know.

286
00:18:17.699 --> 00:18:19.128
According to number two,

287
00:18:19.328 --> 00:18:20.969
she was scouted to a bigger factory.

288
00:18:21.128 --> 00:18:22.269
Is that so?

289
00:18:26.868 --> 00:18:28.068
Jung Hee...

290
00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:31.539
Do Ha, why are you only doing laundry today?

291
00:18:31.979 --> 00:18:33.309
You didn't even eat lunch.

292
00:18:41.719 --> 00:18:43.388
Number three quit?

293
00:18:45.088 --> 00:18:47.289
Then what was this? A goodbye gift?

294
00:18:47.289 --> 00:18:49.759
She gave you a gift?

295
00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:51.358
- Yes. - Of course she did.

296
00:18:51.959 --> 00:18:53.398
She liked you so much.

297
00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:56.398
Who? Number three did?

298
00:18:57.138 --> 00:18:58.299
- Didn't you know? - Didn't you know?

299
00:18:59.969 --> 00:19:01.709
How would I know?

300
00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:03.439
You're so slow.

301
00:19:03.608 --> 00:19:06.749
How could you not? Even I could see it.

302
00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:11.148
Us twins are both slow.

303
00:19:11.449 --> 00:19:12.878
Look at Jung Hee.

304
00:19:12.878 --> 00:19:14.888
She still doesn't know how you feel.

305
00:19:15.249 --> 00:19:17.189
Why are you changing the subject?

306
00:19:18.618 --> 00:19:20.289
Did you have fun talking with Jin?

307
00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:22.489
It must have been nice to see him again.

308
00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:25.098
- Stop it. - That hurts.

309
00:19:36.739 --> 00:19:38.539
Because of your Dad's case,

310
00:19:38.739 --> 00:19:41.279
he had to find something to report to his superior.

311
00:19:41.479 --> 00:19:44.118
Young Choon was unlucky.

312
00:19:45.418 --> 00:19:47.219
Because he helped your father,

313
00:19:47.989 --> 00:19:49.888
they call him a communist.

314
00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:56.729
You better tell us the truth.

315
00:19:57.328 --> 00:20:00.168
Do you want to be seen as a communist?

316
00:20:00.229 --> 00:20:01.699
Do what you want.

317
00:20:02.469 --> 00:20:05.739
It's not like you listen when I talk.

318
00:20:05.838 --> 00:20:06.908
You punk!

319
00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:13.578
Yes.

320
00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.279
Park Jin Soo's daughter?

321
00:20:20.749 --> 00:20:22.049
Is that so?

322
00:20:22.318 --> 00:20:23.388
Yes.

323
00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:27.888
Joo Young Choon was never involved with Dad.

324
00:20:29.259 --> 00:20:32.759
He only helped because I asked him.

325
00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:37.539
Joo Young Choon is a punk.

326
00:20:37.699 --> 00:20:38.939
Doesn't he know his place?

327
00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.668
- Why did he approach you? - No.

328
00:20:42.168 --> 00:20:43.979
Young Choon is...

329
00:20:45.378 --> 00:20:46.509
Young Choon...

330
00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:49.479
is someone I like.

331
00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:53.749
We like each other.

332
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:56.989
That's why he helped me.

333
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:02.289
Young Choon...

334
00:21:05.158 --> 00:21:06.559
is innocent.

335
00:21:09.229 --> 00:21:10.598
Let him go.

336
00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:18.638
Hae Joo!

337
00:21:33.888 --> 00:21:35.189
Young Choon.

338
00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:37.759
Why did you do that?

339
00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:41.828
You should have left me in the cell!

340
00:21:43.838 --> 00:21:45.398
Do you want to ruin your life?

341
00:21:47.108 --> 00:21:49.209
I did it because I like you.

342
00:21:51.408 --> 00:21:54.678
I couldn't stand watching you...

343
00:21:54.678 --> 00:21:56.178
ruin your life for me.

344
00:21:58.678 --> 00:22:00.219
Without you,

345
00:22:01.088 --> 00:22:02.888
I don't think I can live.

346
00:22:15.428 --> 00:22:17.898
- Expel her? - Park Hae Joo...

347
00:22:18.469 --> 00:22:19.838
was in a serious relationship...

348
00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:22.009
with a local thug.

349
00:22:22.168 --> 00:22:23.638
Sir,

350
00:22:23.979 --> 00:22:26.309
Hae Joo would never do that.

351
00:22:26.408 --> 00:22:27.878
Sir.

352
00:22:28.608 --> 00:22:31.249
Could you please reconsider?

353
00:22:31.348 --> 00:22:35.049
I'll take responsibility for and teach Hae Joo.

354
00:22:35.648 --> 00:22:38.388
Do you people want to stop being teachers?

355
00:22:38.588 --> 00:22:39.588
Do you?

356
00:22:42.158 --> 00:22:44.128
What is it?

357
00:22:46.328 --> 00:22:48.469
Jung Hee, what is this about?

358
00:22:48.469 --> 00:22:52.598
Does this mean Hae Joo was dating that thug,

359
00:22:52.668 --> 00:22:54.039
Young Choon?

360
00:22:54.068 --> 00:22:56.239
What? No way.

361
00:22:56.239 --> 00:22:57.509
Why not?

362
00:22:57.509 --> 00:23:00.408
They were going on dates with the little kid too.

363
00:23:00.408 --> 00:23:01.979
That's not true.

364
00:23:01.979 --> 00:23:03.848
Hae Joo isn't like that.

365
00:23:10.189 --> 00:23:12.088
That's what happened.

366
00:23:12.259 --> 00:23:14.328
If you want to protest,

367
00:23:14.328 --> 00:23:15.888
you may submit one.

368
00:23:16.689 --> 00:23:18.128
As your teacher,

369
00:23:18.128 --> 00:23:19.358
I'll take your side...

370
00:23:19.358 --> 00:23:20.969
I'll accept it.

371
00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:23.799
I know that if I continue attending this school,

372
00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:26.568
it'll make things harder for all of you.

373
00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:28.969
Don't give up on your studies though.

374
00:23:32.608 --> 00:23:34.249
There's always the GED.

375
00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:37.479
Thank you.

376
00:23:38.148 --> 00:23:39.148
Hey.

377
00:23:39.479 --> 00:23:40.789
Hae Joo.

378
00:23:40.888 --> 00:23:43.318
- Hae Joo. - Hae Joo.

379
00:23:43.318 --> 00:23:45.918
Hae Joo. What's going on?

380
00:23:45.918 --> 00:23:47.928
What did you do wrong?

381
00:23:51.358 --> 00:23:52.598
Hae Joo.

382
00:23:54.898 --> 00:23:58.269
Hey. Seoul Chick. Are you running away?

383
00:23:58.638 --> 00:24:01.709
You always argue so well at other times.

384
00:24:02.868 --> 00:24:05.039
Are you leaving like this? It's cowardly.

385
00:24:07.878 --> 00:24:08.949
I know.

386
00:24:10.049 --> 00:24:11.618
I'm a coward.

387
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:16.318
Thank you all for everything.

388
00:24:16.318 --> 00:24:18.918
- No, Hae Joo. - Hae Joo.

389
00:24:19.059 --> 00:24:20.328
Hae Joo.

390
00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:27.928
Let's begin.

391
00:24:30.138 --> 00:24:31.138
Mr. Oh!

392
00:24:31.739 --> 00:24:33.509
This isn't fair.

393
00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:36.108
- Jung Hee. - How could this happen?

394
00:24:36.108 --> 00:24:37.408
It's too mean.

395
00:24:37.408 --> 00:24:38.739
- It's not right! - This is wrong.

396
00:24:38.739 --> 00:24:40.809
- How can you do this? - It's so mean.

397
00:24:41.979 --> 00:24:44.678
You pigs! Open your books!

398
00:24:44.678 --> 00:24:46.549
Do you all want to get expelled too?

399
00:25:08.009 --> 00:25:09.408
Jung Hee, sit down.

400
00:25:14.209 --> 00:25:15.209
Jung Hee!

401
00:25:17.848 --> 00:25:19.848
Don't sit if you don't want to.

402
00:25:19.848 --> 00:25:21.189
Page 72.

403
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:25.618
Jung Hee, where are you going?

404
00:25:39.068 --> 00:25:40.868
JHBS.

405
00:25:42.439 --> 00:25:44.039
Jeonghyeon's broadcasting club.

406
00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:47.249
We will begin a temporary broadcast.

407
00:25:47.348 --> 00:25:48.709
Isn't that Jung Hee?

408
00:25:49.479 --> 00:25:51.418
Are you surprised?

409
00:25:51.918 --> 00:25:54.249
- What is that? - Today...

410
00:25:54.249 --> 00:25:55.618
is a very sad day...

411
00:25:56.959 --> 00:25:58.388
on which our friend...

412
00:25:59.689 --> 00:26:01.529
is leaving the school.

413
00:26:03.059 --> 00:26:04.128
That is why...

414
00:26:04.928 --> 00:26:07.029
we are having this temporary broadcast.

415
00:26:07.898 --> 00:26:09.729
We wish our friend...

416
00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:12.439
Park Hae Joo, whom we love,

417
00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:16.168
a life full of nothing but happiness.

418
00:26:17.908 --> 00:26:20.078
We will play a song Hae Joo liked...

419
00:26:21.509 --> 00:26:24.219
as a farewell song.

420
00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:32.658
Goodbye,

421
00:26:34.989 --> 00:26:36.459
my friend Hae Joo.

422
00:26:49.068 --> 00:26:51.239
Why that wench.

423
00:26:54.148 --> 00:26:55.378
What's wrong with this?

424
00:26:55.378 --> 00:26:56.979
Why won't the door open?

425
00:26:57.178 --> 00:26:59.249
I think the door is jammed.

426
00:26:59.578 --> 00:27:01.588
What's wrong with this?

427
00:27:39.418 --> 00:27:42.759
Hello. I'm Park Hae Joo.

428
00:27:43.059 --> 00:27:44.428
One day,

429
00:27:44.428 --> 00:27:46.969
I want to experience passionate love.

430
00:27:48.368 --> 00:27:49.628
I am a hot-blooded...

431
00:27:50.398 --> 00:27:51.598
woman.

432
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:05.019
Jung Hee. We're friends now, right?

433
00:28:05.019 --> 00:28:06.578
Good night, friend.

434
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:10.759
Jung Hee. Are you okay?

435
00:28:28.939 --> 00:28:30.908
Thank you, Jung Hee.

00:29:13.648 --> 00:29:14.818
Thank you.

00:29:15.588 --> 00:29:16.648
Thank you.

441
00:29:19.959 --> 00:29:21.289
Be happy.

442
00:29:23.189 --> 00:29:25.029
I love you, my friend.

443
00:29:49.418 --> 00:29:51.888
Goodbye, Hae Joo.

444
00:30:08.168 --> 00:30:10.709
Quiet. It's the teacher.

445
00:30:11.138 --> 00:30:13.809
Yes. What is this about?

446
00:30:16.779 --> 00:30:17.779
Yes.

447
00:30:19.078 --> 00:30:20.189
Jung Hee...

448
00:30:21.189 --> 00:30:22.289
Probation?

449
00:30:25.989 --> 00:30:27.729
What do you mean?

450
00:30:29.588 --> 00:30:31.759
(Apology)

451
00:30:45.939 --> 00:30:47.309
I heard you were on probation too.

452
00:30:47.908 --> 00:30:49.178
Bong Soo told me.

453
00:30:51.418 --> 00:30:53.848
What are you doing? It isn't raining.

454
00:30:55.318 --> 00:30:56.818
Let's just say it is.

455
00:30:57.118 --> 00:30:59.918
I have no excuse to come otherwise.

456
00:31:00.229 --> 00:31:01.759
Why do you need an excuse?

457
00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:03.029
You don't need to come.

458
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:04.699
How could I not when you feel terrible?

459
00:31:04.699 --> 00:31:05.828
I was worried.

460
00:31:10.868 --> 00:31:11.868
We are...

461
00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:14.838
friends after all. Friends.

462
00:31:16.138 --> 00:31:17.939
My friend feels terrible.

463
00:31:18.678 --> 00:31:20.908
A true friend should be there with her.

464
00:31:24.318 --> 00:31:25.378
Friends.

465
00:31:27.588 --> 00:31:28.689
We're friends,

466
00:31:29.848 --> 00:31:33.289
but I couldn't give Hae Joo any help.

467
00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:37.459
I wasn't good to her either.

468
00:31:38.959 --> 00:31:41.529
That's not true. You did your best.

469
00:31:41.999 --> 00:31:43.199
I'm sure she knows that.

470
00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:45.398
You were crazy brave,

471
00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:46.809
Jung Hee.

472
00:31:48.368 --> 00:31:51.309
Friendship doesn't end because she was expelled.

473
00:31:53.138 --> 00:31:54.509
Friendship lasts forever.

474
00:31:55.148 --> 00:31:56.249
Like you and me.

475
00:31:58.078 --> 00:31:59.249
You and me?

476
00:32:04.318 --> 00:32:05.318
Let go.

477
00:32:06.928 --> 00:32:08.158
Let's share.

478
00:32:13.059 --> 00:32:14.328
Take it.

479
00:32:15.469 --> 00:32:17.098
Let's use it.

480
00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:23.309
Why are you getting home now?

481
00:32:23.878 --> 00:32:24.939
Get over here.

482
00:32:25.108 --> 00:32:27.108
Get over here!

483
00:32:27.108 --> 00:32:29.908
- Father. - Who are you? Step aside.

484
00:32:29.908 --> 00:32:30.979
Move.

485
00:32:30.979 --> 00:32:32.348
You're dead. Come here.

486
00:32:33.348 --> 00:32:35.648
- Stop it! - Probation?

487
00:32:35.648 --> 00:32:38.019
I told you not to hang out with that communist,

488
00:32:38.118 --> 00:32:39.489
didn't I?

489
00:32:39.489 --> 00:32:41.128
- Get over here. - Stop.

490
00:32:41.128 --> 00:32:42.928
- Stop it! - Let go.

491
00:32:43.259 --> 00:32:44.398
Let go.

492
00:32:44.428 --> 00:32:46.158
I spent good money...

493
00:32:46.499 --> 00:32:49.828
and educated you. I spoiled you too much.

494
00:32:50.239 --> 00:32:53.469
How dare you lie and hang out with a communist?

495
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:54.868
What about you?

496
00:32:55.469 --> 00:32:57.638
- Why did you lie to us? - What?

497
00:32:57.979 --> 00:32:59.279
What did I lie about?

498
00:32:59.408 --> 00:33:00.479
When did I lie?

499
00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:03.648
You lied to mom and to us, and cheated with...

500
00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:05.678
You brat!

501
00:33:10.118 --> 00:33:11.189
What?

502
00:33:15.358 --> 00:33:16.999
You thought I didn't know, right?

503
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:21.898
I saw you and Auntie all happy together...

504
00:33:21.898 --> 00:33:23.999
Get inside. Get in there.

505
00:33:29.608 --> 00:33:31.578
Father. What...

506
00:33:32.209 --> 00:33:34.608
What is that...

507
00:34:02.668 --> 00:34:04.209
Did you know?

508
00:34:05.078 --> 00:34:06.279
Since when?

509
00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:09.879
Why didn't you say anything?

510
00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:13.519
Because I was embarrassed.

511
00:34:15.749 --> 00:34:18.959
I was embarrassed of your father.

512
00:34:19.618 --> 00:34:21.928
I was embarrassed of myself.

513
00:34:24.158 --> 00:34:26.899
And I was embarrassed of Auntie.

514
00:34:29.229 --> 00:34:31.638
Imagine how bad I was that a cheapskate...

515
00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:35.508
like your father would cheat.

516
00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:41.149
Is embarrassment more painful...

517
00:34:41.178 --> 00:34:42.749
than betrayal?

518
00:34:44.319 --> 00:34:47.448
Are all adults like that?

519
00:34:48.988 --> 00:34:51.118
It wasn't because I was embarrassed.

520
00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:54.729
Isn't it pitiful?

521
00:34:55.789 --> 00:34:58.129
I feel sorry for your father.

522
00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:00.899
I feel sorry for Auntie,

523
00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:06.339
and I feel sorry for me.

524
00:36:05.399 --> 00:36:08.269
I had been putting money into a savings account...

525
00:36:08.968 --> 00:36:10.839
in your name.

526
00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:14.809
Madam.

527
00:36:15.609 --> 00:36:16.809
No.

528
00:36:17.539 --> 00:36:19.979
You paid me regularly.

529
00:36:20.448 --> 00:36:22.078
Don't do this.

530
00:36:30.758 --> 00:36:32.488
Were you planning to leave like this?

531
00:36:32.689 --> 00:36:35.089
Is that why all you did was work like a cow...

532
00:36:35.959 --> 00:36:37.229
the past few days?

533
00:36:42.368 --> 00:36:44.198
Meet a nice man.

534
00:36:45.598 --> 00:36:49.238
And have a pretty baby that looks like you.

535
00:36:53.339 --> 00:36:54.649
Madam.

536
00:36:55.448 --> 00:36:57.048
I'm sorry.

537
00:36:57.419 --> 00:36:58.749
Please forgive me.

538
00:37:01.649 --> 00:37:02.948
I'm sorry.

539
00:37:04.819 --> 00:37:06.158
You have...

540
00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:09.158
such a kind heart...

541
00:37:09.559 --> 00:37:11.859
like a stupid idiot.

542
00:37:13.828 --> 00:37:16.069
It must've killed you inside.

543
00:37:18.939 --> 00:37:20.439
Madam.

544
00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:51.638
Here.

545
00:37:52.399 --> 00:37:53.569
What is it?

546
00:38:17.359 --> 00:38:19.459
I should just quit.

547
00:38:20.769 --> 00:38:21.928
Let's quit.

548
00:38:32.178 --> 00:38:34.209
You should eat something.

549
00:38:34.348 --> 00:38:36.209
You'll get sick.

550
00:38:42.289 --> 00:38:43.459
Suk Hee.

551
00:39:07.508 --> 00:39:08.848
Sorry.

552
00:39:13.988 --> 00:39:15.118
I...

553
00:39:16.189 --> 00:39:17.589
was wrong.

554
00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:23.528
I was lonely.

555
00:39:25.658 --> 00:39:29.428
Life was just too tough.

556
00:39:31.298 --> 00:39:32.439
No.

557
00:39:33.738 --> 00:39:35.209
That's not it.

558
00:39:35.638 --> 00:39:38.979
I... I was just wrong.

559
00:39:42.249 --> 00:39:43.819
Are you really sorry?

560
00:39:48.149 --> 00:39:49.319
I'm sorry.

561
00:40:02.169 --> 00:40:03.999
I'm truly sorry.

562
00:40:06.769 --> 00:40:08.339
Whatever you say,

563
00:40:09.368 --> 00:40:11.809
I'll do everything...

564
00:40:12.138 --> 00:40:13.408
Then...

565
00:40:16.508 --> 00:40:18.218
go to sleep.

566
00:40:19.448 --> 00:40:20.919
Stop talking.

567
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:43.368
- Auntie left. - What?

568
00:40:45.078 --> 00:40:47.548
She asked me to tell you she said bye...

569
00:40:48.008 --> 00:40:49.678
since she couldn't see you before she left.

570
00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:55.149
That moron. All she did was work nonstop.

571
00:41:25.778 --> 00:41:26.888
Jung Hee.

572
00:41:27.988 --> 00:41:31.758
I wanted to see you before I left,

573
00:41:32.618 --> 00:41:33.959
but I just left.

574
00:41:35.928 --> 00:41:38.899
I was happy living with my kind...

575
00:41:39.258 --> 00:41:41.028
and pretty Jung Hee.

576
00:41:42.298 --> 00:41:43.328
That's right.

577
00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:46.908
I left you a gift in the closet.

578
00:41:49.638 --> 00:41:51.408
I made it.

579
00:41:52.678 --> 00:41:54.408
I hope you like it.

580
00:42:00.089 --> 00:42:01.149
Jung Hee.

581
00:42:02.988 --> 00:42:05.189
Grow up to be a beautiful girl.

582
00:42:05.718 --> 00:42:06.959
Be proud.

583
00:42:08.488 --> 00:42:09.758
Love, Auntie.

584
00:42:55.238 --> 00:42:56.738
Are you leaving?

585
00:42:57.008 --> 00:42:58.178
Why did you come again?

586
00:42:58.839 --> 00:43:01.749
Everyone knows me in this neighborhood.

587
00:43:02.678 --> 00:43:03.879
It's hard for me to make a living.

588
00:43:05.078 --> 00:43:06.419
Take care of yourself.

589
00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:10.359
I already told you.

590
00:43:12.488 --> 00:43:14.459
How can you do this to me?

591
00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:17.098
I heard you were expelled from school.

592
00:43:19.698 --> 00:43:21.999
How far will you go until you wake up?

593
00:43:26.698 --> 00:43:28.309
Forget about me...

594
00:43:29.839 --> 00:43:31.178
and have a good life.

595
00:43:36.408 --> 00:43:37.519
I will.

596
00:43:38.348 --> 00:43:40.388
If that's what you want,

597
00:43:40.888 --> 00:43:41.948
I will.

598
00:43:45.319 --> 00:43:47.089
I'm not confident,

599
00:43:48.028 --> 00:43:49.689
but I'll try.

600
00:44:32.098 --> 00:44:33.339
How will you live?

601
00:44:35.008 --> 00:44:36.339
It doesn't matter...

602
00:44:36.908 --> 00:44:38.609
to you anymore.

603
00:44:43.778 --> 00:44:44.879
Are you sure...

604
00:44:46.278 --> 00:44:47.448
you won't regret it?

605
00:44:48.919 --> 00:44:50.859
Won't you regret taking off with me?

606
00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:53.428
Why would I when I'm with you?

607
00:44:54.828 --> 00:44:56.859
If I'm with you,

608
00:44:57.629 --> 00:44:58.899
why would I?

609
00:45:22.348 --> 00:45:24.658
Don't leave me behind.

610
00:45:28.689 --> 00:45:30.158
Don't leave me.

611
00:45:35.428 --> 00:45:36.798
I love you, Hae Joo.

612
00:45:53.348 --> 00:45:54.348
Okay.

613
00:46:01.028 --> 00:46:02.629
Give it to me.

614
00:46:06.298 --> 00:46:07.499
Let's go, Eng Cho.

615
00:46:10.198 --> 00:46:12.439
Sit at the front with Eng Cho.

616
00:46:12.439 --> 00:46:14.138
I'll sit here.

617
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:16.839
I'll sit here too.

618
00:46:20.149 --> 00:46:21.149
It's finished.

619
00:46:21.149 --> 00:46:23.078
Okay. Thanks.

620
00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:25.249
- Thank you. - I appreciate it.

621
00:46:26.919 --> 00:46:29.718
Hae Joo. When you settle down,

622
00:46:30.089 --> 00:46:31.158
make sure to contact me.

623
00:46:31.158 --> 00:46:32.419
Of course.

624
00:46:33.158 --> 00:46:34.359
Hey,

625
00:46:34.428 --> 00:46:36.189
you better be good to Hae Joo.

626
00:46:36.189 --> 00:46:37.859
I'll be watching you.

627
00:46:37.859 --> 00:46:40.229
I'm so scared of you.

628
00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:44.539
Don't worry.

629
00:46:45.638 --> 00:46:47.039
I'll take good care of her.

630
00:46:55.278 --> 00:46:56.379
Take care.

631
00:47:01.419 --> 00:47:04.089
Thank you, my friend.

632
00:47:14.528 --> 00:47:16.198
- We're leaving. - Okay.

633
00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:23.339
Don't get sick.

634
00:47:23.908 --> 00:47:25.039
Stay healthy.

635
00:47:58.539 --> 00:47:59.709
Stop crying.

636
00:48:00.778 --> 00:48:02.078
Hae Joo will be fine.

637
00:48:03.149 --> 00:48:04.249
I'm not crying.

638
00:48:05.919 --> 00:48:07.189
I know that.

639
00:48:07.988 --> 00:48:09.519
Hae Joo will be fine.

640
00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:13.289
Park Hae Joo.

641
00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:15.629
It was her dream...

642
00:48:15.758 --> 00:48:16.999
to fall in a passionate love.

643
00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:19.559
Her dream came true.

644
00:48:20.999 --> 00:48:22.069
What about you?

645
00:48:22.868 --> 00:48:24.238
What was your dream?

646
00:48:28.109 --> 00:48:29.169
Son Jin?

647
00:48:29.908 --> 00:48:31.379
You little...

648
00:48:32.638 --> 00:48:34.348
You little...

649
00:48:36.249 --> 00:48:37.749
Since you're feeling down,

650
00:48:38.218 --> 00:48:40.988
should we go see a movie?

651
00:48:41.789 --> 00:48:44.388
Today's show would be sold out already.

652
00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:45.559
It's Sunday.

653
00:48:46.189 --> 00:48:48.658
I already got us tickets.

654
00:48:50.729 --> 00:48:53.468
Wow. Bae Dong Moon.

655
00:48:53.798 --> 00:48:54.928
Also,

656
00:48:55.428 --> 00:48:58.269
I'm going to start officially.

657
00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.468
Start what?

658
00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:03.439
Being your boyfriend.

659
00:49:05.238 --> 00:49:06.278
This is...

660
00:49:06.638 --> 00:49:09.348
considered the first step.

661
00:49:10.178 --> 00:49:11.379
Who says?

662
00:49:12.218 --> 00:49:13.218
Bye.

663
00:49:16.118 --> 00:49:18.718
Anyway, if you show up,

664
00:49:19.059 --> 00:49:20.629
I'll consider that you agree.

665
00:49:20.828 --> 00:49:22.129
I'll become your boyfriend.

666
00:49:22.828 --> 00:49:24.428
Go away.

667
00:49:26.968 --> 00:49:29.069
See you later, Jung Hee.

668
00:49:43.649 --> 00:49:45.718
Who says you can be my boyfriend?

669
00:49:49.289 --> 00:49:50.289
Jung Hee.

670
00:49:52.988 --> 00:49:54.028
Jin.

671
00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:56.359
What are you doing here?

672
00:49:56.798 --> 00:49:58.828
Oh. Well...

673
00:49:58.828 --> 00:50:01.069
What do we do?

674
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:02.828
Hae Joo already left.

675
00:50:03.499 --> 00:50:04.569
Really?

676
00:50:05.999 --> 00:50:08.209
Did she leave today?

677
00:50:10.408 --> 00:50:11.508
I didn't know.

678
00:50:15.649 --> 00:50:16.649
Did the move...

679
00:50:17.548 --> 00:50:18.649
go well?

680
00:50:19.319 --> 00:50:20.319
Yes.

681
00:50:21.089 --> 00:50:23.019
Well... Then...

682
00:50:23.519 --> 00:50:25.559
Did you come on family business?

683
00:50:26.158 --> 00:50:27.158
I...

684
00:50:28.189 --> 00:50:29.388
missed you.

685
00:50:31.959 --> 00:50:33.769
I came because I missed you.

686
00:50:36.298 --> 00:50:38.899
But it's already getting late.

687
00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:40.638
What should I do?

688
00:50:40.968 --> 00:50:42.939
Did you wait a long time?

689
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:46.109
I was helping Hae Joo with her move.

690
00:50:46.138 --> 00:50:47.278
Did you?

691
00:50:48.149 --> 00:50:49.309
Good job.

692
00:51:01.189 --> 00:51:02.589
For some reason,

693
00:51:04.359 --> 00:51:06.359
I kept thinking about you while in Seoul.

694
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:08.528
Then I realized...

695
00:51:10.399 --> 00:51:11.468
that I...

696
00:51:12.968 --> 00:51:15.868
started to like you.

697
00:51:20.408 --> 00:51:21.448
Jung Hee.

698
00:51:23.249 --> 00:51:24.578
If it's not too late,

699
00:51:26.519 --> 00:51:30.089
will you accept my feelings?

700
00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:36.388
Were you surprised?

701
00:51:37.328 --> 00:51:38.499
I'm sure you are.

702
00:51:43.638 --> 00:51:45.499
I have to drop by home.

703
00:51:46.908 --> 00:51:48.669
I have a ticket for the bus at 4pm.

704
00:51:49.408 --> 00:51:52.408
Can I see you before I go?

705
00:51:56.348 --> 00:51:57.678
The 4pm bus?

706
00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:01.919
I'll wait for you at the terminal.

707
00:52:07.388 --> 00:52:09.658
(Showtime: 4pm)

708
00:52:10.158 --> 00:52:12.528
Why does everything...

709
00:52:12.959 --> 00:52:15.198
come to you a step too late?

710
00:53:53.868 --> 00:53:54.968
Jung Hee.

711
00:53:58.439 --> 00:53:59.499
I'm sorry.

712
00:54:01.939 --> 00:54:05.078
The film is starting. Please come in.

713
00:54:27.328 --> 00:54:30.638
The 4pm bus to Seoul is departing soon. Get on.

714
00:54:48.289 --> 00:54:49.319
Jung Hee.

715
00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:05.069
Aren't you going in?

716
00:55:05.499 --> 00:55:07.908
- Pardon? - It's starting soon.

717
00:55:28.859 --> 00:55:32.098
Jung Hee. Are you not coming?

718
00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:34.999
I guess you don't like me.

719
00:56:21.479 --> 00:56:22.578
Is this...

720
00:56:23.879 --> 00:56:25.178
how it's going to end?

721
00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:28.749
What are you doing? The film is over.

722
00:56:30.048 --> 00:56:32.388
I'm leaving.

723
00:56:33.118 --> 00:56:34.488
I'll leave.

724
00:56:37.629 --> 00:56:38.629
Jung Hee.

725
00:56:40.298 --> 00:56:42.669
Dong Moon. Is that where you were?

726
00:56:48.539 --> 00:56:49.569
Jung Hee.

727
00:56:53.948 --> 00:56:54.979
When did you get here?

728
00:56:55.048 --> 00:56:57.149
I was a little late,

729
00:56:57.448 --> 00:56:59.448
so I couldn't find my seat and sat here.

730
00:56:59.548 --> 00:57:00.988
My neck hurts.

731
00:57:04.658 --> 00:57:05.789
Jung Hee.

732
00:57:07.629 --> 00:57:08.789
Thank you.

733
00:57:14.629 --> 00:57:16.098
Thank you so much.

734
00:57:17.399 --> 00:57:19.939
What's wrong with you? Let me go.

735
00:57:29.948 --> 00:57:30.979
Jung Hee.

736
00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:35.388
Bae Dong Moon.

737
00:57:37.019 --> 00:57:38.158
You won.

738
00:57:51.169 --> 00:57:54.138
I thought you weren't coming.

739
00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.778
Why wouldn't I?

740
00:57:58.109 --> 00:57:59.578
It'd be a waste of a movie ticket.

741
00:58:00.479 --> 00:58:02.149
Is that why you came?

742
00:58:03.249 --> 00:58:04.618
Didn't you come for me?

743
00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:07.289
No.

744
00:58:11.319 --> 00:58:12.359
You did.

745
00:58:15.689 --> 00:58:16.928
Then...

746
00:58:19.698 --> 00:58:21.499
Well...

747
00:58:22.968 --> 00:58:25.939
I started to like Dong Moon.

748
00:58:29.169 --> 00:58:32.039
I'm sorry, Jin.

749
00:58:34.908 --> 00:58:36.149
Don't be sorry.

750
00:58:37.819 --> 00:58:39.419
People...

751
00:58:40.618 --> 00:58:42.149
change minds all the time.

752
00:58:45.258 --> 00:58:46.388
Just like...

753
00:58:47.158 --> 00:58:48.229
how my heart...

754
00:58:49.758 --> 00:58:51.298
turned towards you.

755
00:59:03.269 --> 00:59:04.439
Right?

756
00:59:06.278 --> 00:59:09.048
No. I really didn't.

757
00:59:11.078 --> 00:59:12.149
You're...

758
00:59:12.979 --> 00:59:14.519
giving me the permission, right?

759
00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:16.758
As your boyfriend?

760
00:59:18.988 --> 00:59:21.129
- Maybe. - What do you mean maybe?

761
00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:24.258
I can see it on your face.

762
00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:26.899
Nothing is on my face.

763
00:59:28.968 --> 00:59:30.069
It's written all over.

764
00:59:30.399 --> 00:59:32.399
"Yes, let's do that."

765
00:59:32.899 --> 00:59:34.238
That's what it says.

766
00:59:35.368 --> 00:59:36.609
You're a liar.

767
00:59:44.118 --> 00:59:46.178
Hey, Dong Moon.

768
00:59:48.988 --> 00:59:50.118
Jung Hee.

769
00:59:54.828 --> 00:59:56.559
I really, really like you.

770
01:00:18.078 --> 01:00:19.218
Jung Hee.

771
01:00:27.928 --> 01:00:29.258
Wait for me.

772
01:00:29.528 --> 01:00:30.629
I don't want to.

773
01:00:30.999 --> 01:00:33.359
- Let's walk together. - I don't want to.

774
01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:36.069
Don't be mad. Come on.

775
01:00:36.229 --> 01:00:37.298
All right.

776
01:00:38.198 --> 01:00:40.039
- Do you want steamed bun? - Steamed buns?

777
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:42.039
Yes. No?

778
01:00:50.879 --> 01:00:52.178
Eun Ja,

779
01:00:52.948 --> 01:00:54.649
- I love you. - Are you crazy?

780
01:00:54.649 --> 01:00:55.689
I love you.

781
01:00:55.689 --> 01:00:56.888
- I'm crazy about you. - What are you saying?

782
01:00:56.888 --> 01:00:59.819
Roses? Daisies? You look like them all.

783
01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:01.658
- I'll tattle to Jung Hee. - Go ahead!

784
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:02.859
What's wrong?

785
01:01:07.428 --> 01:01:08.528
Suk Hee.

786
01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:20.778
Please take them.

787
01:01:31.618 --> 01:01:35.789
(Thank you for watching Girls' Generation 1979.)

788
01:01:39.129 --> 01:01:40.499
Please be happy,

789
01:01:40.968 --> 01:01:42.198
Young Choon.

790
01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:13.928
What is this?

791
01:02:15.629 --> 01:02:18.069
Come over here! Do this again.

792
01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:20.709
How many times is this?

793
01:02:21.539 --> 01:02:23.169
I told you to do it properly!

794
01:02:23.169 --> 01:02:26.609
Ever since I became a young breadwinner,

795
01:02:26.848 --> 01:02:28.979
I never worked like you.

796
01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:31.749
How many times did I tell you?

797
01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:32.919
Hey!

798
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:34.589
Seriously!

799
01:02:35.548 --> 01:02:37.589
Let's do it right!

800
01:02:37.859 --> 01:02:40.928
What is this? Look at that.
