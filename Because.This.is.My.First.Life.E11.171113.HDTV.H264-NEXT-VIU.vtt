1
00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:23.737
We're making kimchi for the winter this week.

2
00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:26.707
Your family is in Namhae.

3
00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:30.007
- How can I go? - That's not my problem.

4
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.578
I'll text you the address and date later.

5
00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.527
You're up early.

6
00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:53.228
Yes.

7
00:01:03.737 --> 00:01:05.277
That one's mine.

8
00:01:06.808 --> 00:01:08.648
This is yours.

9
00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:12.047
Okay.

10
00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:15.717
Are you going out already?

11
00:01:15.988 --> 00:01:19.458
Yes. I told Bok Nam I'd eat breakfast with him...

12
00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:21.198
at the cafe.

13
00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:22.928
I see.

14
00:01:25.967 --> 00:01:27.738
Our lease agreement...

15
00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:32.607
No, I mean our lease and marriage agreement.

16
00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:34.478
I'm taking it out with me.

17
00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:38.577
Your mother went through all the drawers two days ago.

18
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:41.978
I'll leave it at the cafe since that's more safe.

19
00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:45.148
She won't be coming anymore.

20
00:01:45.187 --> 00:01:47.818
- We had a talk, and I changed... - Sure.

21
00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:51.527
It's not my problem what you two talked about.

22
00:01:52.127 --> 00:01:55.627
You never know, so you should take yours to work too.

23
00:01:56.857 --> 00:01:57.997
It would be awkward...

24
00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.068
for someone to find the agreement.

25
00:02:03.368 --> 00:02:04.467
Okay.

26
00:02:05.907 --> 00:02:07.008
Okay, then.

27
00:02:22.217 --> 00:02:23.918
Good job, Ji Ho.

28
00:02:24.787 --> 00:02:26.227
It was perfect.

29
00:02:26.558 --> 00:02:28.597
You didn't waver even once.

30
00:02:30.197 --> 00:02:31.597
Poker face.

31
00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:35.768
She's definitely mad at me.

32
00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:37.967
Right?

33
00:03:00.287 --> 00:03:02.157
(Two-year Term Lease Marriage Agreement)

34
00:03:07.738 --> 00:03:09.838
Why did you go in there?

35
00:03:13.407 --> 00:03:14.608
Let's go.

36
00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:22.118
Wow. They're using a negative strategy.

37
00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:25.418
They were going for the opposite of our app.

38
00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:27.888
The problem is, it's working.

39
00:03:28.058 --> 00:03:31.328
They're ahead of us in the app store after just a month of its release.

40
00:03:31.588 --> 00:03:32.958
This app...

41
00:03:33.287 --> 00:03:36.298
has sections for the parents' jobs and annual income.

42
00:03:36.697 --> 00:03:39.268
It worked to lure in users that are conservative.

43
00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:41.738
People that date with marriage in mind...

44
00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:43.868
want to have proper relationships.

45
00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:53.178
Mr. Nam, what do you think about this emergency situation?

46
00:03:55.347 --> 00:03:56.747
The design's concept...

47
00:03:59.388 --> 00:04:00.518
is excellent.

48
00:04:02.187 --> 00:04:05.328
If they placed the event banner underneath the profile,

49
00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:07.388
it would have been a lot better.

50
00:04:10.527 --> 00:04:11.597
Mr. Nam.

51
00:04:12.298 --> 00:04:15.537
I'm not asking you to share your appreciation for design.

52
00:04:15.537 --> 00:04:16.597
Can you...

53
00:04:18.908 --> 00:04:21.377
Shouldn't we change our concept at this stage?

54
00:04:21.877 --> 00:04:24.408
I think it's dangerous to split up the dating market...

55
00:04:24.408 --> 00:04:26.147
and the marriage market.

56
00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:30.478
Even our app's name sounds wrong. "Dating Instead of Marriage"?

57
00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:32.848
Who named our app?

58
00:04:48.468 --> 00:04:51.468
But he's the only one that's married.

59
00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:58.348
Okay, then. We'll have another concept meeting tomorrow.

60
00:04:58.647 --> 00:05:01.778
Think about if we should continue to highlight dating,

61
00:05:01.877 --> 00:05:04.517
or if we should change to something that encompasses marriage.

62
00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:07.218
Think about it and we'll talk tomorrow.

63
00:05:07.218 --> 00:05:08.757
- Okay? - Okay.

64
00:05:14.858 --> 00:05:17.528
Why were you there?

65
00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:19.697
You should have made them think you couldn't go.

66
00:05:20.598 --> 00:05:22.337
You could have said you were busy.

67
00:05:23.497 --> 00:05:25.468
I thought you were a good defender.

68
00:05:27.978 --> 00:05:31.278
Ji Ho. It wasn't in our contract,

69
00:05:33.678 --> 00:05:35.778
but this is the compensation for...

70
00:05:37.218 --> 00:05:38.918
your unfair labor tonight.

71
00:05:42.618 --> 00:05:45.827
Does he think he's Won Bin? Does he want me to name the price?

72
00:05:46.957 --> 00:05:48.528
Did something happen with your landlord?

73
00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.098
When did you take that?

74
00:05:53.968 --> 00:05:55.368
It's not a bad deal.

75
00:05:55.368 --> 00:05:57.507
Maybe I should get a contract marriage too.

76
00:05:58.507 --> 00:06:00.637
You have a place and a motorcycle. You don't need to.

77
00:06:00.668 --> 00:06:03.778
But it's completely different from having someone at home.

78
00:06:04.137 --> 00:06:05.908
I'm lonely when I'm home alone.

79
00:06:06.108 --> 00:06:09.178
You have your husband at home, so you wouldn't get lonely.

80
00:06:10.178 --> 00:06:13.988
Hey. Do you know why they call husbands a husband?

81
00:06:14.658 --> 00:06:17.118
Because they'll never be yours.

82
00:06:17.528 --> 00:06:21.127
There's an old saying that goes, "Give easy dishes to your daughter,"

83
00:06:21.127 --> 00:06:23.457
"while giving the hard dishes to your daughter-in-law."

84
00:06:24.127 --> 00:06:25.468
A daughter-in-law that's like a real daughter?

85
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.837
She should have adopted a daughter instead then.

86
00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:30.238
Seriously.

87
00:06:34.678 --> 00:06:35.738
What is it?

88
00:06:36.007 --> 00:06:37.077
Ji Ho.

89
00:06:37.507 --> 00:06:39.947
You sound just like someone I know.

90
00:06:40.707 --> 00:06:43.017
- Who? - The lady next door.

91
00:06:43.348 --> 00:06:45.587
- What? - She's always...

92
00:06:47.218 --> 00:06:49.017
talking bad about her husband with that face.

93
00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:51.428
How can you make the exact same face?

94
00:06:54.327 --> 00:06:56.098
You were so sweet when you first started working.

95
00:06:56.397 --> 00:06:58.868
I never thought I'd see her face in yours.

96
00:07:00.327 --> 00:07:02.098
I'd better not get married.

97
00:07:17.247 --> 00:07:20.087
The app started off on the wrong foot.

98
00:07:20.387 --> 00:07:23.288
"Dating Instead of Marriage" sounds very harsh.

99
00:07:23.587 --> 00:07:24.887
It's too pessimistic.

100
00:07:25.358 --> 00:07:27.228
- I said that. - I know.

101
00:07:27.428 --> 00:07:28.858
We talked about this.

102
00:07:29.158 --> 00:07:30.257
I told you.

103
00:07:30.298 --> 00:07:32.397
That's why we should...

104
00:07:32.397 --> 00:07:35.897
change our concept to support marriage.

105
00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:37.637
Yes.

106
00:07:37.637 --> 00:07:39.908
- Yes. - We need to change it.

107
00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:48.077
Everyone, look at this.

108
00:07:48.317 --> 00:07:51.887
Someone asked for a day off in this state of emergency.

109
00:07:52.147 --> 00:07:56.418
- Shall we guess who it is? - It wasn't me.

110
00:07:56.488 --> 00:07:58.827
"Request for a day off. Department: design".

111
00:07:59.058 --> 00:08:01.298
"Name: Nam Se Hee".

112
00:08:02.058 --> 00:08:03.457
It's Mr. Nam.

113
00:08:04.168 --> 00:08:07.228
I have a personal business to attend and it's on a weekday.

114
00:08:07.228 --> 00:08:09.567
What kind of office worker has business...

115
00:08:09.567 --> 00:08:11.767
to attend on a weekday?

116
00:08:11.968 --> 00:08:14.408
I have to go make kimchi.

117
00:08:15.908 --> 00:08:17.908
Kimchi?

118
00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:20.377
Kimchi? What's kimchi?

119
00:08:20.377 --> 00:08:22.278
Is it a new program?

120
00:08:22.647 --> 00:08:24.118
Do you mean...

121
00:08:24.618 --> 00:08:26.947
you're making kimchi for winter?

122
00:08:27.247 --> 00:08:29.757
Yes, that's it.

123
00:08:30.187 --> 00:08:33.628
How far are you going to make kimchi...

124
00:08:33.628 --> 00:08:36.428
- to take a day off? - To Namhae. My wife's.

125
00:08:37.197 --> 00:08:40.668
No, my in-laws'. I'm going to make kimchi.

126
00:08:44.437 --> 00:08:46.508
I haven't taken a day off this year.

127
00:08:47.008 --> 00:08:49.308
I'd appreciate a speedy approval.

128
00:08:51.577 --> 00:08:55.117
It'd be best to keep our app's name the way it is.

129
00:08:56.178 --> 00:08:58.847
- Yes. - The current name is the best.

130
00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:00.888
- Yes. - Let's go.

131
00:09:02.957 --> 00:09:05.827
That's how scary marriage is.

132
00:09:11.998 --> 00:09:13.227
(Episode 11)

133
00:09:13.227 --> 00:09:14.538
Kimchi?

134
00:09:14.538 --> 00:09:17.737
(Because This Is My First Beach)

135
00:09:27.548 --> 00:09:30.987
You have this app too? "Dating Instead of Marriage"?

136
00:09:31.788 --> 00:09:34.158
No, my boyfriend works for this company,

137
00:09:34.158 --> 00:09:35.487
so I just downloaded it.

138
00:09:35.687 --> 00:09:36.817
Really?

139
00:09:37.528 --> 00:09:39.928
You received so many hearts.

140
00:09:40.128 --> 00:09:41.898
It's nothing. It's just for fun.

141
00:09:42.028 --> 00:09:44.268
That's true, you'll be married soon.

142
00:09:45.197 --> 00:09:46.768
Did you set the date yet?

143
00:09:47.298 --> 00:09:48.398
What?

144
00:09:49.268 --> 00:09:52.437
We're still talking about it.

145
00:09:53.967 --> 00:09:55.937
Did you check the lunch reservations?

146
00:09:56.008 --> 00:09:57.138
- Yes. - Yes.

147
00:10:06.317 --> 00:10:07.447
Hello?

148
00:10:08.957 --> 00:10:10.087
Yes, Mother.

149
00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:14.258
Yes, yes. You're in Seoul?

150
00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:17.097
Pardon?

151
00:10:18.268 --> 00:10:19.367
You're downstairs?

152
00:10:19.668 --> 00:10:21.837
I'll be right out.

153
00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:34.048
You should have dinner with Ho Rang and I.

154
00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:35.717
I have to make dinner for my husband.

155
00:10:36.918 --> 00:10:38.687
I had some time until my bus,

156
00:10:38.947 --> 00:10:41.518
so I came to see my son-in-law instead of my daughter.

157
00:10:42.918 --> 00:10:44.058
Son-in-law?

158
00:10:45.258 --> 00:10:48.998
I saw the ring, and the rock is quite big.

159
00:10:49.227 --> 00:10:50.758
I think you spent too much.

160
00:10:50.928 --> 00:10:53.898
No, that's the least I can do for Ho Rang.

161
00:10:53.898 --> 00:10:55.237
Yes.

162
00:10:55.867 --> 00:10:57.808
I'm saying this because she's my daughter,

163
00:10:59.008 --> 00:11:01.778
but there are no girls like her these days.

164
00:11:01.878 --> 00:11:05.508
Once you get married, she'll be a good housewife.

165
00:11:05.508 --> 00:11:07.548
She learned from me ever since she was young.

166
00:11:08.778 --> 00:11:09.977
I know that.

167
00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:13.788
Then...

168
00:11:15.018 --> 00:11:17.827
When do you plan on having the wedding?

169
00:11:18.457 --> 00:11:20.258
What did your parents say?

170
00:11:23.628 --> 00:11:24.798
Well...

171
00:11:25.327 --> 00:11:27.798
I haven't told my parents yet.

172
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.337
You should hurry up and tell them.

173
00:11:29.638 --> 00:11:31.607
It's not good to drag on.

174
00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.808
How long are you going to let Ho Rang live...

175
00:11:34.808 --> 00:11:36.837
in a small place with Soo Ji?

176
00:11:37.038 --> 00:11:38.408
Yes, that's true.

177
00:11:40.648 --> 00:11:44.317
Are you still living in that rooftop house?

178
00:11:44.888 --> 00:11:47.048
Yes, I'm still there.

179
00:11:47.048 --> 00:11:48.658
Do they get hot water there?

180
00:11:49.018 --> 00:11:50.018
What about the wind?

181
00:11:50.018 --> 00:11:51.987
It's fine.

182
00:12:02.398 --> 00:12:04.337
(Shim Won Seok and Yang Ho Rang)

183
00:12:05.937 --> 00:12:08.107
Ho Rang, what are you talking about?

184
00:12:08.207 --> 00:12:10.408
How can we get married two years later?

185
00:12:10.607 --> 00:12:13.378
Why can't we get married? We saved up.

186
00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:17.447
Pick the service you want.

187
00:12:18.788 --> 00:12:21.658
We saved 500 dollars a month for two years.

188
00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:24.258
That's 1,000 dollars for 24 months.

189
00:12:24.558 --> 00:12:27.498
- That's... - Please take your bank book.

190
00:12:28.528 --> 00:12:30.428
That's a lot of money.

191
00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.077
Where did I take it off?

192
00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:48.217
Did I never put it on at home?

193
00:12:52.847 --> 00:12:54.187
Yes, Mr. Park.

194
00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:56.558
Ms. Woo, what's taking you so long? Food is here.

195
00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:58.587
Okay, I'm coming.

196
00:13:08.867 --> 00:13:10.398
I'll keep my jacket on.

197
00:13:13.737 --> 00:13:15.737
It's delicious.

198
00:13:17.648 --> 00:13:19.148
Help yourselves.

199
00:13:19.908 --> 00:13:21.048
I'm sweating.

200
00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:23.477
It's hot.

201
00:13:25.817 --> 00:13:27.288
Aren't you hot, Ms. Woo?

202
00:13:27.687 --> 00:13:29.217
You should take that off.

203
00:13:29.788 --> 00:13:30.928
It's okay.

204
00:13:35.197 --> 00:13:36.658
- What? - Gosh.

205
00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:39.528
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:42.268
- I'm sorry. - Did you get hurt?

207
00:13:42.268 --> 00:13:44.268
It slipped. Here's a wet tissue.

208
00:13:44.268 --> 00:13:46.308
Here, I'll wipe it.

209
00:13:46.308 --> 00:13:48.178
I'm sorry, it slipped.

210
00:13:50.737 --> 00:13:51.908
Look.

211
00:14:03.018 --> 00:14:04.558
I told you.

212
00:14:04.558 --> 00:14:06.857
She goes around without it. I told you.

213
00:14:06.857 --> 00:14:11.528
Give it to me. It's 50 dollars each.

214
00:14:11.528 --> 00:14:13.898
How can she not wear a bra?

215
00:14:13.998 --> 00:14:15.538
Do a lot of women do that these days?

216
00:14:15.538 --> 00:14:17.367
Is she a B?

217
00:14:17.367 --> 00:14:19.508
B? No, no.

218
00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:21.378
She's a full A.

219
00:14:21.378 --> 00:14:22.778
A full A.

220
00:14:22.878 --> 00:14:24.308
How do you know that?

221
00:14:24.308 --> 00:14:27.817
I can tell when I look at it.

222
00:14:28.077 --> 00:14:30.217
I just know.

223
00:14:30.847 --> 00:14:34.048
Seriously. Only if I wasn't married.

224
00:14:34.158 --> 00:14:37.418
I would get it on with Ms. Woo.

225
00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:39.888
I would do that, you know.

226
00:14:42.028 --> 00:14:43.128
Ms. Woo.

227
00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:46.467
How long were you standing there?

228
00:14:47.467 --> 00:14:48.638
Give me a light.

229
00:14:58.778 --> 00:15:00.248
You do smoke.

230
00:15:00.378 --> 00:15:01.648
Did you win a lot?

231
00:15:02.278 --> 00:15:03.378
What?

232
00:15:03.748 --> 00:15:05.617
I'm talking about the bet you made on my bra.

233
00:15:06.087 --> 00:15:07.187
What?

234
00:15:07.888 --> 00:15:11.487
It was obvious since I'm a full A, right?

235
00:15:15.727 --> 00:15:18.867
It looks like you're about the same size as me.

236
00:15:19.197 --> 00:15:21.538
If you don't intend on working out, let me know.

237
00:15:21.867 --> 00:15:23.437
I'll lend you mine.

238
00:15:37.817 --> 00:15:38.987
Take it away.

239
00:15:39.487 --> 00:15:41.518
I don't know the intention of your glance.

240
00:15:42.658 --> 00:15:44.628
You know I hate such things.

241
00:15:46.357 --> 00:15:48.857
What happens to you when you get married?

242
00:15:49.097 --> 00:15:51.268
How did kimchi and vacation day...

243
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:54.097
get into your closed-off world of IT?

244
00:15:54.097 --> 00:15:55.237
How did they penetrate?

245
00:15:55.237 --> 00:15:58.308
Well, it was something predictable.

246
00:15:58.908 --> 00:16:00.607
My parents are giving her trouble,

247
00:16:00.837 --> 00:16:03.207
and I intend on paying it back through labor.

248
00:16:04.248 --> 00:16:06.148
She was called to help prepare for a memorial service.

249
00:16:06.977 --> 00:16:08.117
Ji Ho.

250
00:16:10.817 --> 00:16:11.947
I got it.

251
00:16:12.288 --> 00:16:14.158
Do you remember Uhm Byung Moon?

252
00:16:14.317 --> 00:16:16.617
After the holidays, he picks up...

253
00:16:16.617 --> 00:16:18.528
after his wife for a month.

254
00:16:18.587 --> 00:16:22.327
She doesn't want to see anyone with the last name Uhm.

255
00:16:22.327 --> 00:16:25.428
He'll be kicked out of the room, so he goes to the couch.

256
00:16:25.428 --> 00:16:28.038
When his parents visit, he puts up an act...

257
00:16:28.038 --> 00:16:29.138
as if he's the head of the house.

258
00:16:29.367 --> 00:16:33.268
I really don't get what this is.

259
00:16:33.837 --> 00:16:37.778
It's a social illness created by Korean parents.

260
00:16:37.778 --> 00:16:40.748
They exploit their kids' partner by calling them family.

261
00:16:40.748 --> 00:16:42.148
They are pressured to do physical and mental labor.

262
00:16:42.148 --> 00:16:44.248
Then it's returned as a fight, a separation,

263
00:16:44.248 --> 00:16:46.148
or a divorce of the children.

264
00:16:46.148 --> 00:16:48.357
If someone has a rational mind,

265
00:16:48.888 --> 00:16:51.687
it's a system they should never pick. Marriage.

266
00:16:51.888 --> 00:16:54.428
Exactly. Never...

267
00:16:57.928 --> 00:17:01.867
Then why did someone like you choose such a system?

268
00:17:02.668 --> 00:17:05.738
I'm suddenly surprised.

269
00:17:05.907 --> 00:17:08.208
All you think about are mortgage and Kitty.

270
00:17:08.208 --> 00:17:10.538
Why did you choose to do something so irrational?

271
00:17:10.538 --> 00:17:12.677
Is your wife a cat lover?

272
00:17:12.677 --> 00:17:15.548
Unless you're getting rent from your wife,

273
00:17:15.817 --> 00:17:18.548
it's hard for me to understand.

274
00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.258
She's pretty.

275
00:17:23.018 --> 00:17:24.887
It doesn't matter how pretty she is.

276
00:17:24.988 --> 00:17:26.958
Did you forget? She's pretty.

277
00:17:27.698 --> 00:17:30.728
- What's men's weakness? - Vision.

278
00:17:30.728 --> 00:17:33.228
Then what if a pretty woman is in front of you?

279
00:17:33.528 --> 00:17:35.968
- Would you look at her or not? - I would.

280
00:17:35.968 --> 00:17:38.308
Then if you could see that woman every day,

281
00:17:38.407 --> 00:17:41.137
would you marry her or not?

282
00:17:41.137 --> 00:17:43.337
- I'd marry her no matter what. - Exactly.

283
00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:45.877
Do you get it now?

284
00:17:53.788 --> 00:17:55.788
I'm at the parking lot by your office's side door.

285
00:17:55.788 --> 00:17:57.117
Come here in 20 minutes.

286
00:17:57.357 --> 00:18:01.157
I'm really frustrated right now, so you better prepare yourself.

287
00:18:02.058 --> 00:18:04.127
You should go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

288
00:18:04.127 --> 00:18:06.268
I thought you had an important meeting today.

289
00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:08.067
Something more important just got scheduled.

290
00:18:08.167 --> 00:18:10.597
- Bye. Is that the side door? - No.

291
00:18:11.667 --> 00:18:13.508
- The side door is over there. - Okay.

292
00:18:13.768 --> 00:18:14.938
See you later.

293
00:18:16.337 --> 00:18:19.008
- I'm sorry. - I'll do it.

294
00:18:19.407 --> 00:18:21.617
I'm sorry. See you tomorrow. Bye.

295
00:18:32.258 --> 00:18:35.528
Ta-da. Hello, baby.

296
00:18:40.097 --> 00:18:41.837
All right.

297
00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:43.938
Let's go eat first.

298
00:18:43.938 --> 00:18:47.808
I told you, I'm frustrated.

299
00:18:53.347 --> 00:18:54.718
What is it?

300
00:18:56.278 --> 00:18:58.188
Something happened at work, didn't it?

301
00:18:58.917 --> 00:19:00.188
No. What?

302
00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:06.188
What's wrong? Nothing happened.

303
00:19:10.228 --> 00:19:12.798
Tell me. I want to know.

304
00:19:13.067 --> 00:19:14.238
Something happened, right?

305
00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.468
Something annoying happened.

306
00:19:20.768 --> 00:19:23.438
The male employees made a bet on something related to me.

307
00:19:23.577 --> 00:19:24.607
What bet?

308
00:19:24.607 --> 00:19:27.778
They betted 50 dollars each on whether I was wearing a bra or not.

309
00:19:28.018 --> 00:19:29.077
What?

310
00:19:30.917 --> 00:19:32.887
Gosh, why those little...

311
00:19:33.587 --> 00:19:34.657
Forget it.

312
00:19:35.188 --> 00:19:37.218
I gave them a lesson already.

313
00:19:37.827 --> 00:19:38.887
How?

314
00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.587
I threw my cigarette...

315
00:19:40.728 --> 00:19:43.157
in Mr. Park's coffee cup like this.

316
00:19:44.867 --> 00:19:47.498
Those punks are driving me crazy.

317
00:19:48.137 --> 00:19:50.698
I'll earn a lot of money and buy your company for certain.

318
00:19:50.698 --> 00:19:52.768
And I'll give those darn employees...

319
00:19:53.137 --> 00:19:55.438
a hard time as my underlings forever.

320
00:19:55.978 --> 00:19:58.677
How could they make a bet on such an issue?

321
00:19:58.708 --> 00:20:00.478
What do they take you for?

322
00:20:00.607 --> 00:20:03.677
What kind of women don't wear a bra at their company in the first place?

323
00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:06.048
- Goodness. - Me.

324
00:20:07.387 --> 00:20:08.387
What?

325
00:20:08.657 --> 00:20:10.958
I haven't been in a bra all day today.

326
00:20:13.427 --> 00:20:14.528
Are you serious?

327
00:20:32.778 --> 00:20:34.617
What?

328
00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:37.518
I'm on my way home now.

329
00:20:47.127 --> 00:20:50.028
Have you had dinner?

330
00:20:50.028 --> 00:20:52.667
Do you think I've had dinner at this hour?

331
00:20:53.097 --> 00:20:56.167
No, I'll go eat at home.

332
00:20:57.038 --> 00:20:58.468
I haven't eaten yet either.

333
00:20:59.407 --> 00:21:02.278
Do you want to eat out for dinner today?

334
00:21:02.478 --> 00:21:04.038
What? Dine out?

335
00:21:05.748 --> 00:21:08.117
It's not necessary.

336
00:21:08.117 --> 00:21:10.077
We both can't spend much on living expenses.

337
00:21:10.748 --> 00:21:12.847
- Let's just... - Just take out ingredients...

338
00:21:12.847 --> 00:21:14.817
from the fridge and make yourself something for dinner.

339
00:21:16.718 --> 00:21:18.427
How can he ask to eat out for dinner...

340
00:21:18.427 --> 00:21:20.087
with what he did yesterday?

341
00:21:20.688 --> 00:21:23.198
He's more like an enemy than my husband.

342
00:21:24.167 --> 00:21:27.367
Why did I get married in the first place?

343
00:21:27.837 --> 00:21:31.208
Hey, you look very similar to someone I know.

344
00:21:31.337 --> 00:21:33.167
- Who? - The lady next door.

345
00:21:33.567 --> 00:21:36.438
She badmouths her husband with this look.

346
00:21:36.438 --> 00:21:37.907
How can even your face expression be the same?

347
00:21:40.377 --> 00:21:43.048
What? He supports the family?

348
00:21:43.778 --> 00:21:46.417
He gives me a tiny amount of living expenses,

349
00:21:46.518 --> 00:21:48.657
and he takes so much credit for it.

350
00:21:48.657 --> 00:21:50.458
Goodness, I can't stand this.

351
00:21:50.988 --> 00:21:54.627
- My life is so miserable. - Gosh.

352
00:22:21.857 --> 00:22:23.958
I'm taking my day off tomorrow.

353
00:22:27.458 --> 00:22:29.028
- Is that right? - Yes.

354
00:22:29.298 --> 00:22:33.028
Let me know your parents' house address, and I'll go there in time.

355
00:22:34.938 --> 00:22:37.738
Okay, I'll send you the address.

356
00:22:42.907 --> 00:22:44.008
By the way,

357
00:22:45.008 --> 00:22:47.008
I can't go there tomorrow.

358
00:22:47.377 --> 00:22:49.048
I know.

359
00:22:49.347 --> 00:22:51.188
You have to work.

360
00:22:53.587 --> 00:22:55.458
You went to our memorial service alone.

361
00:22:56.117 --> 00:22:58.857
So it's only right for me to go to your house alone too.

362
00:22:59.627 --> 00:23:02.698
I'll work there for six hours just like you did.

363
00:23:08.397 --> 00:23:12.107
Did you put the contract in your office?

364
00:23:13.938 --> 00:23:15.877
No, it's in my briefcase.

365
00:23:16.978 --> 00:23:20.008
Mr. Ma goes through my documents from time to time.

366
00:23:20.308 --> 00:23:21.847
So I thought it'd be safer this way.

367
00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:26.387
We'll be in trouble if Mr. Ma finds out about this.

368
00:23:26.788 --> 00:23:28.758
Right, that should never happen.

369
00:23:29.117 --> 00:23:31.728
Then it'll be only a matter of time Soo Ji finds out too.

370
00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:34.087
What?

371
00:23:35.357 --> 00:23:36.657
Didn't you know?

372
00:23:37.327 --> 00:23:40.298
Mr. Ma and Soo Ji are dating.

373
00:23:41.268 --> 00:23:42.367
They're dating?

374
00:23:42.998 --> 00:23:45.907
How did that happen?

375
00:23:45.907 --> 00:23:47.008
Tell me about it.

376
00:23:47.337 --> 00:23:50.137
Humans are such interesting beings.

377
00:23:51.407 --> 00:23:53.048
They don't look good together at all.

378
00:23:53.647 --> 00:23:55.647
But how can they be in a relationship?

379
00:23:59.117 --> 00:24:00.288
What is he talking about?

380
00:24:01.488 --> 00:24:03.087
We're married too.

381
00:24:18.167 --> 00:24:21.538
My girlfriend is braless?

382
00:24:26.607 --> 00:24:28.548
People would notice it for certain.

383
00:24:28.778 --> 00:24:31.617
You think they wouldn't, don't you? But they notice it right away.

384
00:24:32.488 --> 00:24:35.157
It's their fault to notice it, not mine.

385
00:24:35.357 --> 00:24:38.458
Of course, it's their fault. I'm sure about it, but...

386
00:24:40.688 --> 00:24:42.397
Tell me honestly. Have you...

387
00:24:42.397 --> 00:24:44.768
gone to work without wearing a bra before as well?

388
00:24:44.998 --> 00:24:46.097
Sometimes.

389
00:24:47.298 --> 00:24:49.538
I take it off when I work away and sometimes forget to wear it back on.

390
00:24:49.637 --> 00:24:50.907
My goodness.

391
00:24:51.667 --> 00:24:53.438
You're crazy.

392
00:24:53.837 --> 00:24:56.708
I would've gone naked if I really were crazy.

393
00:24:58.077 --> 00:25:01.548
Goodness.

394
00:25:02.877 --> 00:25:05.248
Do you really have to talk back to every single word I say?

395
00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:08.857
Understand me a little. I hate it.

396
00:25:09.317 --> 00:25:11.028
Why are you so angry?

397
00:25:12.558 --> 00:25:13.728
Soo Ji.

398
00:25:14.127 --> 00:25:16.097
Can't you feel my heart?

399
00:25:16.427 --> 00:25:19.367
My true worrying and loving heart?

400
00:25:20.028 --> 00:25:21.137
I'm not sure.

401
00:25:21.337 --> 00:25:24.308
Why do I feel like you're rationalizing yourself...

402
00:25:24.508 --> 00:25:26.208
and romanticizing your possessiveness with love?

403
00:25:26.438 --> 00:25:29.907
Why do you feel that way?

404
00:25:31.548 --> 00:25:33.748
This is different from our contract.

405
00:25:33.978 --> 00:25:35.917
Why do you intrude my privacy?

406
00:25:37.048 --> 00:25:39.048
I'm glad you mentioned it.

407
00:25:39.087 --> 00:25:41.258
You know what you wrote on the contract, right?

408
00:25:45.528 --> 00:25:47.798
Here. Do you call this your privacy?

409
00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:52.528
What's this? It's strange.

410
00:25:53.167 --> 00:25:56.137
Where did you learn this bad habit of backing out?

411
00:25:57.038 --> 00:25:58.308
Let's see.

412
00:25:58.468 --> 00:26:02.107
"Two-year Term Lease Marriage Agreement".

413
00:26:02.177 --> 00:26:03.637
What's this?

414
00:26:06.077 --> 00:26:07.647
What's this?

415
00:26:09.077 --> 00:26:11.117
(Dating Agreement)

416
00:26:13.188 --> 00:26:14.758
(Woo Soo Ji, Ma Sang Goo)

417
00:26:35.538 --> 00:26:36.637
Ji Ho.

418
00:26:38.248 --> 00:26:39.548
Take a look at this.

419
00:26:39.808 --> 00:26:42.548
What's this? "Dating Agreement"?

420
00:26:42.647 --> 00:26:46.317
Yes, this seems to be the dating agreement between Mr. Ma and Soo Ji.

421
00:26:47.248 --> 00:26:48.417
I told you...

422
00:26:48.587 --> 00:26:50.887
that they don't look good together at all.

423
00:26:52.327 --> 00:26:54.127
And look here.

424
00:26:54.758 --> 00:26:57.097
Soo Ji is the former,

425
00:26:58.268 --> 00:26:59.327
and Mr. Ma is the latter.

426
00:26:59.397 --> 00:27:01.468
Goodness, so it's real.

427
00:27:02.468 --> 00:27:05.907
Why did they sign a contract on their dating?

428
00:27:10.907 --> 00:27:12.907
Well, we're not in the position to say this.

429
00:27:13.847 --> 00:27:16.218
By the way, how do you have this?

430
00:27:16.577 --> 00:27:20.218
We bumped into each other a while ago. I think our stuff got mixed up,

431
00:27:20.647 --> 00:27:21.988
and it ended up in my briefcase.

432
00:27:22.657 --> 00:27:23.857
I see.

433
00:27:24.728 --> 00:27:28.157
It's not like this got switched with our agreement, is it?

434
00:27:35.798 --> 00:27:36.798
What?

435
00:27:40.538 --> 00:27:42.538
(Two-year Term Lease Marriage Agreement)

436
00:27:44.708 --> 00:27:46.607
You haven't dated him for long, but you're getting married?

437
00:27:46.778 --> 00:27:50.647
Many people get married only after 2 or 3 months after the relationship.

438
00:27:50.847 --> 00:27:53.587
Why do you keep calling him your landlord?

439
00:27:54.657 --> 00:27:55.958
Did I?

440
00:27:55.958 --> 00:27:57.927
- A part-time job? Why? - What?

441
00:27:59.127 --> 00:28:01.198
Well, I need to work in order to pay for my rent...

442
00:28:02.258 --> 00:28:05.468
I mean, our living expenses and phone bills.

443
00:28:08.567 --> 00:28:10.167
Ji Ho, this crazy brat.

444
00:28:30.927 --> 00:28:32.587
What do you have to give me this time?

445
00:28:32.927 --> 00:28:34.058
Well...

446
00:28:35.058 --> 00:28:38.897
It's the marinated crab which my mom sent me last time.

447
00:28:39.597 --> 00:28:41.798
She gave this so that I could share with everyone.

448
00:28:42.167 --> 00:28:44.367
And I forgot to give you some.

449
00:28:45.567 --> 00:28:48.577
Thanks. I should call her once.

450
00:28:48.938 --> 00:28:50.008
She's well, right?

451
00:28:50.308 --> 00:28:51.778
Of course.

452
00:28:51.778 --> 00:28:54.847
- She isn't ill or anything, is she? - Of course not.

453
00:28:55.048 --> 00:28:58.188
- What about your lease marriage? - Of course.

454
00:29:01.258 --> 00:29:02.988
You pay 250 dollars a month.

455
00:29:03.288 --> 00:29:05.857
Hey, there are not many places that cost only that amount these days.

456
00:29:06.157 --> 00:29:07.528
Soo Ji... Well...

457
00:29:07.528 --> 00:29:10.827
If you're okay with it, can I move into his house after two years?

458
00:29:11.228 --> 00:29:12.597
As his next wife.

459
00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:14.538
- Come on. - What?

460
00:29:15.298 --> 00:29:16.597
You did nothing good.

461
00:29:18.837 --> 00:29:19.968
Crazy brat.

462
00:29:21.938 --> 00:29:22.938
Crazy punk.

463
00:29:24.808 --> 00:29:26.248
Goodness.

464
00:29:29.677 --> 00:29:33.587
How did you even think about getting married though?

465
00:29:33.587 --> 00:29:36.688
We all have different ways...

466
00:29:37.157 --> 00:29:38.728
to live our lives.

467
00:29:38.728 --> 00:29:40.958
But you did it just for your house.

468
00:29:41.458 --> 00:29:43.427
You just did it just to get the rental fee!

469
00:29:49.998 --> 00:29:51.508
It's not just for the house.

470
00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:54.577
It's not just to get the rental fee.

471
00:29:55.208 --> 00:29:57.177
You have no idea how important the house is.

472
00:29:57.948 --> 00:29:59.048
You should also know...

473
00:30:00.308 --> 00:30:01.917
money really matters too.

474
00:30:07.657 --> 00:30:09.617
It was just an empty room to me.

475
00:30:11.258 --> 00:30:13.288
However, it was something she really needed.

476
00:30:13.827 --> 00:30:15.627
She was desperate to have her own room.

477
00:30:17.298 --> 00:30:18.667
So I shared my place...

478
00:30:19.228 --> 00:30:21.067
using the proper legal system.

479
00:30:22.038 --> 00:30:23.137
I...

480
00:30:24.367 --> 00:30:25.837
needed some money too.

481
00:30:32.208 --> 00:30:33.907
Did Ji Ho...

482
00:30:37.948 --> 00:30:39.817
remind you of her?

483
00:30:57.567 --> 00:30:59.268
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you...

484
00:31:00.038 --> 00:31:01.508
that my marriage wasn't real.

485
00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:04.407
Of course, you couldn't tell me.

486
00:31:04.647 --> 00:31:06.107
How could you tell me that?

487
00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:08.478
By the way, why are you sorry?

488
00:31:09.778 --> 00:31:11.248
You are the one who's suffering.

489
00:31:18.357 --> 00:31:19.657
Are you really okay?

490
00:31:20.357 --> 00:31:21.528
Of course.

491
00:31:22.258 --> 00:31:24.198
It was my decision.

492
00:31:25.298 --> 00:31:28.867
It takes a long time to decide something,

493
00:31:29.968 --> 00:31:33.607
but when I do, I hardly regret my decision.

494
00:31:35.137 --> 00:31:37.077
It doesn't look nothing to me.

495
00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:40.048
Your marriage...

496
00:31:41.278 --> 00:31:43.278
is not something you count as nothing.

497
00:31:45.887 --> 00:31:47.817
You like your husband.

498
00:31:49.657 --> 00:31:51.558
I mean, your landlord.

499
00:31:53.927 --> 00:31:57.498
I have feelings for someone these days.

500
00:31:57.897 --> 00:31:59.067
What do you mean?

501
00:31:59.067 --> 00:32:00.498
Who is that?

502
00:32:01.397 --> 00:32:02.567
My husband.

503
00:32:05.508 --> 00:32:07.407
I don't think you felt that way at first.

504
00:32:08.637 --> 00:32:10.508
Have you been falling for him while living together?

505
00:32:16.518 --> 00:32:17.647
No, it's not.

506
00:32:19.218 --> 00:32:20.718
Maybe I liked him from the start.

507
00:32:24.488 --> 00:32:27.458
I don't know when I started to feel this way.

508
00:32:29.927 --> 00:32:31.097
What about him?

509
00:32:32.698 --> 00:32:35.498
Does he like you too?

510
00:32:42.008 --> 00:32:43.137
No.

511
00:32:45.147 --> 00:32:46.978
He doesn't even know...

512
00:32:49.048 --> 00:32:50.778
that I like him.

513
00:33:07.798 --> 00:33:09.038
There must be a way...

514
00:33:10.298 --> 00:33:12.337
to reach someone's heart.

515
00:33:21.677 --> 00:33:23.117
If there's a way,

516
00:33:23.278 --> 00:33:24.587
(Shim Won Seok and Yang Ho Rang)

517
00:33:24.587 --> 00:33:28.058
there must be...

518
00:33:29.087 --> 00:33:30.488
where it starts.

519
00:33:30.488 --> 00:33:31.587
Ho Rang!

520
00:33:33.927 --> 00:33:35.028
Ho Rang!

521
00:33:35.927 --> 00:33:36.998
Look!

522
00:33:37.798 --> 00:33:39.397
Did you make it?

523
00:33:40.427 --> 00:33:43.468
I'll put 500 dollars in it too!

524
00:33:43.597 --> 00:33:47.038
As we promised, let's put 500 dollars a month from now on.

525
00:33:47.038 --> 00:33:49.308
When the three-year-term ends,

526
00:33:49.308 --> 00:33:50.907
we will move to somewhere nicer than here, am I right?

527
00:33:50.907 --> 00:33:52.048
We will.

528
00:33:52.948 --> 00:33:55.077
We have already saved 1,000 dollars.

529
00:33:55.518 --> 00:33:57.817
We might end up buying a house with a front yard.

530
00:33:58.248 --> 00:33:59.748
I prefer an apartment.

531
00:34:00.857 --> 00:34:02.317
If that's what you want...

532
00:34:04.927 --> 00:34:06.458
Let's do that!

533
00:34:13.768 --> 00:34:18.108
(Shim Won Seok deposited 150 dollars.)

534
00:34:21.407 --> 00:34:25.208
(Yang Ho Rang deposited 500 dollars.)

535
00:34:38.757 --> 00:34:40.188
I'm so relieved now.

536
00:34:40.358 --> 00:34:43.657
If you are going to have kids and raise them, it's not too soon.

537
00:34:43.827 --> 00:34:47.568
Don't make my girl, Ho Rang, go through a hard time.

538
00:34:48.197 --> 00:34:49.297
I won't.

539
00:34:49.568 --> 00:34:51.907
I know you won't.

540
00:34:53.308 --> 00:34:56.077
This is for celebrating your new job.

541
00:34:56.277 --> 00:34:59.777
I hope you keep that job for a long time.

542
00:34:59.777 --> 00:35:03.148
Don't think about developing your own application.

543
00:35:03.418 --> 00:35:04.588
Do you hear me?

544
00:35:04.788 --> 00:35:06.447
I do. Thank you so much for this.

545
00:35:06.447 --> 00:35:07.558
That's good.

546

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

547
00:35:31.308 --> 00:35:33.748
If there's a way to reach someone's heart,

548
00:35:35.617 --> 00:35:37.318
there must be somewhere...

549
00:35:40.018 --> 00:35:41.757
we should meet...

550
00:35:43.318 --> 00:35:44.588
at the end.

551
00:35:55.438 --> 00:35:57.097
Ho Rang, are you asleep?

552
00:36:02.507 --> 00:36:03.838
You are home.

553
00:36:05.308 --> 00:36:06.608
You are late.

554
00:36:08.918 --> 00:36:10.447
You smell like soju.

555
00:36:11.987 --> 00:36:13.387
I drank a bit.

556
00:36:14.987 --> 00:36:16.117
Ho Rang.

557
00:36:17.487 --> 00:36:19.558
Do you want to go on a date with me this weekend?

558
00:36:21.327 --> 00:36:22.558
A date?

559
00:36:23.228 --> 00:36:24.998
Yes, a date.

560
00:36:25.898 --> 00:36:29.268
Let's go out and eat something nice.

561
00:36:30.168 --> 00:36:31.768
We can watch a movie too.

562
00:36:34.538 --> 00:36:37.677
You told me there's a play you wanted to see.

563
00:36:38.648 --> 00:36:40.347
I will book that too.

564
00:36:43.418 --> 00:36:46.148
Okay. Let's do that.

565
00:36:49.418 --> 00:36:51.558
Okay. Let's do that.

566
00:37:05.838 --> 00:37:09.507
Will there be a different way that starts...

567
00:37:13.177 --> 00:37:17.518
from where our hearts meet?

568
00:37:19.918 --> 00:37:22.358
But the thing I'm afraid of the most is...

569
00:37:24.427 --> 00:37:27.327
not that we have different ways,

570
00:37:30.358 --> 00:37:34.498
nor that we'll never meet on the way.

571
00:37:37.038 --> 00:37:38.568
What I'm afraid of the most is...

572
00:37:40.068 --> 00:37:42.108
I talked to Mr. Ma and it went well.

573
00:37:42.538 --> 00:37:43.808
I will sleep first.

574
00:37:44.447 --> 00:37:45.777
that there's no way to reach your heart.

575
00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:51.748
What if there's just no way to reach your heart...

576
00:37:53.788 --> 00:37:55.318
at all?

577
00:37:56.257 --> 00:37:58.088
That's what I'm afraid of.

578
00:37:59.128 --> 00:38:00.628
I received the address.

579
00:38:00.827 --> 00:38:03.228
I'll go help your family make kimchi.

580
00:38:03.858 --> 00:38:05.568
But for now,

581
00:38:07.297 --> 00:38:08.938
I can't do anything about it.

582
00:38:11.338 --> 00:38:13.808
I don't know the way to reach his heart.

583
00:38:15.407 --> 00:38:17.748
But he does know where to go make kimchi.

584
00:38:18.447 --> 00:38:19.677
That's him,

585
00:38:27.918 --> 00:38:30.117
and I like him.

586
00:38:31.887 --> 00:38:33.887
For now,

587
00:38:37.527 --> 00:38:38.797
that is enough.

588
00:38:41.998 --> 00:38:43.268
Really?

589
00:38:43.367 --> 00:38:47.108
Just some bottles of makgeolli won't be enough while making kimchi.

590
00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:50.338
Just get a lot that's enough to fill a whole bucket.

591
00:38:51.447 --> 00:38:53.277
Okay.

592
00:38:54.077 --> 00:38:56.777
Ji Seok and our daughter-in-law will be here soon.

593
00:38:57.518 --> 00:38:59.717
It's not even a national event.

594
00:38:59.717 --> 00:39:02.257
Why did you tell her to come here? She's pregnant.

595
00:39:02.257 --> 00:39:04.257
Where's Ji Ho? When is she going to be here?

596
00:39:04.927 --> 00:39:07.387
Ji Ho doesn't have time for that.

597
00:39:07.527 --> 00:39:09.558
She is busy making her living in Seoul.

598
00:39:09.558 --> 00:39:12.068
She's doing nothing at home. What's making her busy?

599
00:39:12.068 --> 00:39:15.938
She's married now. She should learn how to make kimchi.

600
00:39:16.038 --> 00:39:18.068
Goodness.

601
00:39:23.838 --> 00:39:25.308
Hey, Ji Ho. What's going on?

602
00:39:26.808 --> 00:39:29.248
What? Who's coming here?

603
00:39:29.347 --> 00:39:31.117
Yes, later to help you.

604
00:39:31.288 --> 00:39:32.947
What about your work?

605
00:39:32.947 --> 00:39:34.987
I can't go,

606
00:39:35.288 --> 00:39:37.288
but someone else will go in place of me.

607
00:39:37.588 --> 00:39:38.927
Who's coming?

608
00:39:55.808 --> 00:39:58.007
Hey! It's cold. Close the window.

609
00:40:22.668 --> 00:40:24.407
You've deviated from the original course.

610
00:40:25.768 --> 00:40:28.137
- What? - This is not the right direction.

611
00:40:29.938 --> 00:40:31.708
I'm searching for the right direction.

612
00:40:37.688 --> 00:40:39.688
You're making so much.

613
00:40:39.788 --> 00:40:41.217
How could you buy 100 heads of cabbage...

614
00:40:41.217 --> 00:40:42.288
when we don't have enough people to work on?

615
00:40:42.487 --> 00:40:44.827
Don't worry about it.

616
00:40:45.628 --> 00:40:48.728
We'll be done before your husbands come home.

617
00:40:50.728 --> 00:40:53.097
By the way, is Ji Ho not coming?

618
00:40:53.527 --> 00:40:54.768
- Ji Ho? - Yes.

619
00:40:55.438 --> 00:40:56.498
Oh, right.

620
00:40:56.998 --> 00:40:59.168
She told me someone else is coming instead of her.

621
00:40:59.467 --> 00:41:00.507
Who?

622
00:41:02.077 --> 00:41:04.038
- Excuse me. - I don't know.

623
00:41:04.108 --> 00:41:05.677
She told me to wait and see.

624
00:41:08.818 --> 00:41:09.847
Excuse me.

625
00:41:11.588 --> 00:41:12.688
Hello.

626
00:41:17.217 --> 00:41:18.558
Hey, Se Hee.

627
00:41:19.458 --> 00:41:21.827
What are you doing here?

628
00:41:22.027 --> 00:41:23.697
- Well... - He's Ji Ho's husband?

629
00:41:23.827 --> 00:41:25.628
- You're good-looking. - He is.

630
00:41:25.628 --> 00:41:28.137
- He's good-looking - He really is.

631
00:41:28.137 --> 00:41:30.168
- You're insane. - What?

632
00:41:30.168 --> 00:41:32.568
- Goodness. - Stop it.

633
00:41:33.768 --> 00:41:35.808
The whole neighborhood looks better with him in it.

634
00:41:37.708 --> 00:41:41.347
I'm here to help you with making kimchi.

635
00:41:43.478 --> 00:41:45.947
So you're the one Ji Ho said...

636
00:41:45.947 --> 00:41:48.188
- That's right. It's me. - Who's here?

637
00:41:48.688 --> 00:41:50.117
Hey, my son-in-law!

638
00:41:53.427 --> 00:41:55.858
What's going on? What are you doing here?

639
00:41:55.927 --> 00:41:58.728
I'm here to help with making kimchi.

640
00:41:59.197 --> 00:42:00.367
Kimchi?

641
00:42:01.268 --> 00:42:02.438
Yes.

642
00:42:02.938 --> 00:42:04.668
Come on in. Welcome.

643
00:42:04.668 --> 00:42:07.068
Bring us something to drink.

644
00:42:08.108 --> 00:42:09.438
Come on in.

645
00:42:09.608 --> 00:42:12.608
We can have bossam after they make kimchi for us.

646
00:42:12.808 --> 00:42:14.378
- Take a seat. - No, that's not right.

647
00:42:14.918 --> 00:42:18.148
I'm not here to have bossam but to help with making kimchi.

648
00:42:19.018 --> 00:42:20.958
I must help her make kimchi.

649
00:42:21.088 --> 00:42:22.188
What?

650
00:42:25.288 --> 00:42:26.987
Actually,

651
00:42:27.527 --> 00:42:30.027
Ji Ho helped with the ancestral rites...

652
00:42:30.297 --> 00:42:31.768
in my parents' place.

653
00:42:31.827 --> 00:42:34.197
That's why I agreed with her to share my labor...

654
00:42:34.297 --> 00:42:36.297
and time equivalent of how she spent hers in my parents'.

655
00:42:36.367 --> 00:42:38.068
What are you talking about?

656
00:42:38.068 --> 00:42:40.768
It's only natural for a daughter-in-law to do that.

657
00:42:41.808 --> 00:42:44.108
Is that right? She helped in your parents' place?

658
00:42:44.248 --> 00:42:45.308
Yes, she did.

659
00:42:46.208 --> 00:42:48.878
Stop talking nonsense, and sit down here.

660
00:42:49.018 --> 00:42:50.547
Let's have a drink.

661
00:42:50.547 --> 00:42:53.387
- I can't... - You'll have to get changed.

662
00:42:54.858 --> 00:42:58.157
You'll need something else to wear. Do you want mine?

663
00:42:59.288 --> 00:43:02.427
- Sure. I'd appreciate that. - Okay.

664
00:43:22.677 --> 00:43:24.018
I've arrived at your parents' place.

665
00:43:24.447 --> 00:43:27.918
We're making kimchi now.

666
00:43:29.058 --> 00:43:30.117
Is there something wrong?

667
00:43:30.318 --> 00:43:32.327
What? No, it's nothing.

668
00:43:34.827 --> 00:43:36.197
Hey, Soo Ji is here.

669
00:43:41.768 --> 00:43:44.838
She's pretty as usual. She's totally my type.

670
00:43:50.407 --> 00:43:51.547
What?

671
00:43:52.478 --> 00:43:53.608
Nothing.

672
00:43:54.878 --> 00:43:57.818
Your type...

673
00:43:58.347 --> 00:43:59.748
changes so fast.

674
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:03.887
You used to tell me how pretty I am.

675
00:44:05.157 --> 00:44:07.387
I just thought you were a little cute.

676
00:44:07.728 --> 00:44:09.197
You're actually not my type.

677
00:44:19.338 --> 00:44:22.177
What? He went to make kimchi in Namhae?

678
00:44:23.308 --> 00:44:24.347
Yes.

679
00:44:25.878 --> 00:44:28.677
He's as amazing as you are.

680
00:44:29.447 --> 00:44:32.288
No wonder you two signed such a contract.

681
00:44:33.518 --> 00:44:36.518
What if he falls sick and can't make it back to Seoul?

682
00:44:37.018 --> 00:44:38.858
I'm sure your mom bought about 100 heads of cabbage.

683
00:44:40.387 --> 00:44:42.927
I don't think they'll make him help.

684
00:44:43.498 --> 00:44:45.827
He'll probably have some bossam and come back.

685
00:44:46.568 --> 00:44:49.338
I knew it already that they won't make him help.

686
00:45:18.128 --> 00:45:19.998
Put that in here.

687
00:45:19.998 --> 00:45:21.768
Where did the garlic go?

688
00:45:23.398 --> 00:45:25.068
How come you're so weak?

689
00:45:25.068 --> 00:45:26.768
Pull it!

690
00:45:27.907 --> 00:45:29.577
My goodness.

691
00:45:33.177 --> 00:45:34.478
Look at him.

692
00:45:36.918 --> 00:45:38.288
Put it over there.

693
00:45:42.518 --> 00:45:44.387
Thank you.

694
00:45:45.827 --> 00:45:47.597
- It's hectic, right? - It is.

695
00:45:48.398 --> 00:45:51.097
They're really salty as they've been preserved in salt.

696
00:45:51.898 --> 00:45:53.998
- They are? - Yes.

697
00:45:54.237 --> 00:45:56.498
That's why you can't season them right away.

698
00:45:56.737 --> 00:46:00.637
You have to rinse them in clean water first.

699
00:46:00.637 --> 00:46:03.777
Then put them in the basket. Do you get it?

700
00:46:04.648 --> 00:46:08.318
Rinse them in clean water...

701
00:46:09.447 --> 00:46:11.987
- and put them there? - That's right. Give it a go.

702
00:46:22.797 --> 00:46:25.228
My goodness. That's not helping.

703
00:46:25.398 --> 00:46:28.938
Wash them like how I'm washing them.

704
00:46:28.938 --> 00:46:30.467
Okay, I'll do that.

705
00:46:33.038 --> 00:46:35.108
How can a newly-wed be so weak?

706
00:46:35.108 --> 00:46:37.108
Would he be able to make a baby?

707
00:46:38.108 --> 00:46:41.617
Don't you know skinny men are better at that?

708
00:46:44.918 --> 00:46:48.858
Stop talking nonsense in front of my son-in-law.

709
00:46:49.257 --> 00:46:51.157
- That was funny. - I know.

710
00:46:51.487 --> 00:46:52.987
Skinny men are better.

711
00:47:05.237 --> 00:47:07.338
No, no. Wash them one more time.

712
00:47:08.177 --> 00:47:10.277
What... What do you mean?

713
00:47:11.047 --> 00:47:14.077
I mean you have to wash them like this again.

714
00:47:14.217 --> 00:47:16.978
Oh, like that. I see.

715
00:47:17.277 --> 00:47:19.588
- Like this. - I mean...

716
00:47:20.117 --> 00:47:21.858
wash them with much strength.

717
00:47:23.487 --> 00:47:25.088
Gosh, I can't believe this.

718
00:47:27.558 --> 00:47:28.597
Okay.

719
00:47:28.858 --> 00:47:32.427
Why on earth would you hit my son-in-law's back, you wench?

720
00:47:46.677 --> 00:47:50.047
What's this? He's really making kimchi?

721
00:47:54.188 --> 00:47:57.117
What? Why would she hit him?

722
00:47:57.688 --> 00:47:59.527
She's crazy.

723
00:48:01.327 --> 00:48:02.797
Please take my order.

724
00:48:03.558 --> 00:48:04.797
Sure!

725
00:48:08.268 --> 00:48:09.938
I'll go take it. You can leave.

726
00:48:10.338 --> 00:48:12.237
- Where to? - Where your husband is.

727
00:48:14.177 --> 00:48:16.277
If you're that concerned, you should go see him.

728
00:48:17.407 --> 00:48:19.308
But you have to come work during the weekend.

729
00:48:29.617 --> 00:48:31.858
Gosh, this is going to take forever.

730
00:48:33.358 --> 00:48:35.998
Put them over here.

731
00:48:52.277 --> 00:48:53.407
What?

732
00:48:54.577 --> 00:48:55.677
What?

733
00:49:24.007 --> 00:49:26.208
- Mr. Nam! - Yes, ma'am!

734
00:49:26.378 --> 00:49:29.077
Come carry this for me.

735
00:49:29.277 --> 00:49:30.677
Why is he just sitting there?

736
00:49:34.088 --> 00:49:35.257
How useless.

737
00:49:35.958 --> 00:49:38.188
I guess he's really here to help with kimchi.

738
00:49:38.188 --> 00:49:42.527
My gosh. He's really weird.

739
00:49:42.958 --> 00:49:44.527
Squeeze them tight.

740
00:49:49.697 --> 00:49:51.568
I've fed them.

741
00:49:53.007 --> 00:49:54.407
Where did he go though?

742
00:49:55.577 --> 00:49:58.608

743
00:50:03.478 --> 00:50:04.748

00:50:09.617 --> 00:50:11.728
Are you here?

745
00:50:12.228 --> 00:50:13.927
When did you come in here?

746
00:50:17.058 --> 00:50:19.827

749

Would it be okay for me to borrow this?

750
00:50:34.878 --> 00:50:38.148

I guess he got this from someone.

755
00:51:33.038 --> 00:51:34.837
That's enough. You can go take a rest.

756
00:51:35.007 --> 00:51:38.237
No, that's okay. I still have some more time to fill.

757
00:51:38.777 --> 00:51:41.377
Since I took my day off, I better use the most of it.

758

759
00:51:46.478 --> 00:51:47.587
Of course.

Ji Ho.

761
00:52:15.447 --> 00:52:18.118
What are you doing here? You just left last time after yelling at me.

762
00:52:22.817 --> 00:52:26.118
What's this? Is this your new business now?

763
00:52:27.217 --> 00:52:30.228
I bought the ones that are most comfortable.

764
00:52:30.288 --> 00:52:31.958
One of them must fit you.

765
00:52:32.098 --> 00:52:33.828
So try them.

766
00:52:34.598 --> 00:52:35.998
If you still find them uncomfortable,

767
00:52:36.498 --> 00:52:39.138
I'll try my best to look for...

768
00:52:40.067 --> 00:52:41.237
something that'd make you comfortable.

769
00:52:45.208 --> 00:52:46.607
I'm sorry...

770
00:52:46.607 --> 00:52:49.578
that I made you feel as though I was pressuring you.

771
00:52:49.748 --> 00:52:51.217
I'll try to fix it.

772
00:52:51.547 --> 00:52:52.848
So you should be...

773
00:52:53.848 --> 00:52:55.547
considerate of me as well.

774
00:52:58.188 --> 00:53:00.928

776
00:53:05.428 --> 00:53:07.098
and imagine weird stuff.

777
00:53:08.428 --> 00:53:10.697
Okay. I'm sorry too.

778
00:53:10.697 --> 00:53:12.138
I'm sorry for thinking it's crossing the line.

779
00:53:13.467 --> 00:53:17.067
How could you just turn off your phone? It made me anxious!

780
00:53:17.877 --> 00:53:19.678
That's because of a meeting.

781
00:53:21.107 --> 00:53:23.208
Wait for me for about an hour. Let's have dinner together.

782
00:53:24.647 --> 00:53:26.748
- Dinner? - Wait for me around here.

783
00:53:38.998 --> 00:53:40.127

787
00:54:01.947 --> 00:54:05.388
How are your back and shoulders?

788
00:54:06.158 --> 00:54:09.558
They ache a bit, but I guess they'll be okay soon.

789
00:54:10.998 --> 00:54:12.127
No.

790
00:54:12.697 --> 00:54:14.728
I should go to a pharmacy...

791
00:54:14.728 --> 00:54:16.397

00:54:34.547 --> 00:54:37.317
come because you were worried about me?

I dreamed of loving someone.

830
00:57:43.467 --> 00:57:44.578
The fact that...

831
00:57:46.678 --> 00:57:49.308
you ended your love...

832
00:57:52.647 --> 00:57:53.917
was a bit...

833
00:57:55.647 --> 00:57:56.987
sad.

834
00:57:59.518 --> 00:58:02.958
- Cheers! - Cheers!

835
00:58:08.167 --> 00:58:10.467
Gosh, my son-in-law.

836
00:58:10.467 --> 00:58:12.667
Good work today.

837
00:58:14.107 --> 00:58:15.507
Here. Let me pour you one.

838
00:58:18.277 --> 00:58:21.107
Have you ever seen anyone like him?

839
00:58:21.578 --> 00:58:24.647
My son-in-law came all the way here to help us making kimchi.

840
00:58:27.217 --> 00:58:29.487
Your daughter must be stressing him out a lot.

841
00:58:29.547 --> 00:58:31.857
You are a man. Why did you come here to help your wife's family?

842
00:58:33.058 --> 00:58:34.587
What do you mean?

843
00:58:34.987 --> 00:58:37.598
When a husband adores his wife,

844
00:58:37.598 --> 00:58:39.228
he can even kiss the fence of his wife's house.

845
00:58:39.697 --> 00:58:41.998
Don't you think he does this because my girl, Ji Ho, is beautiful?

846
00:58:41.998 --> 00:58:44.697
Stop bragging!

847
00:58:46.379 --> 00:58:47.214
Is that true?

848
00:58:47.647 --> 00:58:49.616
Did you come here because you adore your wife that much?

849
00:58:49.946 --> 00:58:51.147
Answer me!

850
00:58:52.598 --> 00:58:55.297
Stop bragging!

851
00:58:56.079 --> 00:58:56.914
Is that true?

852
00:58:57.047 --> 00:58:59.016
Did you come here because you adore your wife that much?

853
00:58:59.346 --> 00:59:00.547
Answer me!

854
00:59:00.922 --> 00:59:03.052
Yes, she is beautiful.

855
00:59:03.352 --> 00:59:05.222
That's why I'm here.

856
00:59:06.363 --> 00:59:08.193
I quite like you.

857
00:59:08.292 --> 00:59:09.992
Let me pour you a glass.

858
00:59:11.403 --> 00:59:13.003
My glass is still full.

859
00:59:13.332 --> 00:59:15.972
You should empty it now and take another one.

860
00:59:16.472 --> 00:59:17.533
I see.

861
00:59:20.803 --> 00:59:21.943
Here you are.

862
00:59:25.843 --> 00:59:26.983
Drink it.

863
00:59:29.512 --> 00:59:30.553
Drink!

864
00:59:32.253 --> 00:59:33.323
Okay.

865
00:59:35.852 --> 00:59:36.923
Drink!

866
00:59:37.963 --> 00:59:40.093
Se Hee, wait!

867
00:59:40.392 --> 00:59:42.432
- Yes? - Here!

868
00:59:42.562 --> 00:59:44.702
- Do you need me now? - Yes!

869
00:59:52.773 --> 00:59:54.642
- Let's drink now. - Let's drink!

870
00:59:55.742 --> 00:59:58.242
Are you okay? You were drinking a lot.

871
00:59:58.912 --> 01:00:00.343
I don't think...

872
01:00:03.682 --> 01:00:05.023
I'm okay.

873
01:00:05.483 --> 01:00:07.753
I think I'm almost hitting my limit.

874
01:00:07.753 --> 01:00:09.923
Where is the son-in-law?

875
01:00:09.923 --> 01:00:12.093
- Where is he? - Come with me!

876
01:00:18.832 --> 01:00:20.863
He won't let you go anywhere.

877
01:00:21.073 --> 01:00:24.173
If you keep drinking what he gives you, that can kill you.

878
01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:27.242
You should've have told me that sooner.

879
01:00:27.642 --> 01:00:30.012
Where's Ji Ho? Did she go somewhere?

880
01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:34.242
She went to get my medication, but she's not coming back yet.

881
01:00:34.452 --> 01:00:36.812
Don't come back soon then.

882
01:00:36.912 --> 01:00:38.582
Come back after walking around a bit.

883
01:00:38.783 --> 01:00:41.523
Call Ji Ho, spend some time with her and come back.

884
01:00:42.023 --> 01:00:43.923
- I will. - Let's go.

885
01:00:44.352 --> 01:00:45.762
- Are you tired? - I am.

886
01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.463
Let's go.

887
01:01:07.812 --> 01:01:10.113
Do you know it's actually the first time we're eating together?

888
01:01:10.452 --> 01:01:11.523
Really?

889
01:01:12.253 --> 01:01:14.222
We ate together before.

890
01:01:14.222 --> 01:01:16.492
What do you mean? We were just drinking makgeolli.

891
01:01:16.492 --> 01:01:18.662
You drank six bottles and got really drunk.

892
01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:21.062
It's made of rice anyway. So I'll count that as a meal.

893
01:01:22.892 --> 01:01:25.963
Let's eat like this from now on...

894
01:01:26.202 --> 01:01:28.803
at least three times a week. It's an order.

895
01:01:30.003 --> 01:01:31.202
But why though?

896
01:01:31.343 --> 01:01:33.542
Do you know how important it is?

897
01:01:33.542 --> 01:01:36.613
Do you have any idea why people are always talking about food?

898
01:01:37.012 --> 01:01:40.142
It's the best way to get closer to each other.

899
01:01:40.883 --> 01:01:44.053
I guess so. That's why Ji Ho fell for him too.

900
01:01:45.383 --> 01:01:47.483
What do you mean?

901
01:01:49.722 --> 01:01:51.093
I mean,

902
01:01:53.162 --> 01:01:55.533
Ji Ho fell for her landlord.

903
01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:59.602
My friend likes your friend.

904
01:02:02.033 --> 01:02:04.003
Don't tell your friend though.

905
01:02:05.202 --> 01:02:06.903
It looks like one-way love.

906
01:02:12.943 --> 01:02:14.983
Do you think it is?

907
01:02:16.852 --> 01:02:17.923
What?

908
01:02:17.923 --> 01:02:19.553
Do you think Se Hee doesn't know...

909
01:02:21.153 --> 01:02:22.622
Ji Ho likes him?

910
01:02:33.963 --> 01:02:35.003
Ji Ho.

911
01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:38.702
Ji Ho.

912
01:02:41.573 --> 01:02:43.042
Ji Ho!

913
01:03:23.852 --> 01:03:25.323
He knows Ji Ho likes him?

914
01:03:25.952 --> 01:03:27.053
Yes, he does.

915
01:03:27.553 --> 01:03:28.852
How about him then?

916
01:03:29.292 --> 01:03:31.562
How does he feel about Ji Ho?

917
01:03:37.733 --> 01:03:40.503
I like their rice. It's really fresh.

918
01:03:41.573 --> 01:03:45.343
Ji Ho has never dated anyone before. She doesn't know anything.

919
01:03:46.273 --> 01:03:47.872
I asked you because I'm worried about her.

920
01:03:55.053 --> 01:03:57.653
Se Hee must be scared because he knows.

921
01:04:01.553 --> 01:04:03.553
He knows what love is.

922
01:04:05.963 --> 01:04:08.363
That's why he's more scared. Don't you think so?

923
01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:20.042
You could have refused...

924
01:04:20.542 --> 01:04:21.713
that makgeolli.

925
01:04:22.173 --> 01:04:24.582
You are good at that normally.

926
01:04:24.983 --> 01:04:26.242
Why could you not do it today?

927
01:04:32.253 --> 01:04:34.792
- What's going on? - This is how you felt...

928
01:04:36.392 --> 01:04:38.792
when I asked you why you went to my house for the rites.

929
01:04:43.593 --> 01:04:45.832
You felt sad like I'm feeling now.

930
01:04:51.542 --> 01:04:53.073
The sea looks great.

931
01:04:54.202 --> 01:04:55.673
I haven't looked at it for a while.

932
01:04:56.713 --> 01:04:57.883
Me too.

933
01:04:58.812 --> 01:04:59.883
I mean,

934
01:05:01.682 --> 01:05:02.983
I have never looked at it...

935
01:05:06.783 --> 01:05:08.423
with someone who's not my family or my friends.

936
01:05:09.722 --> 01:05:11.762
You are neither of them.

937
01:05:14.062 --> 01:05:15.233
I've never looked at it...

938
01:05:16.693 --> 01:05:19.762
with a man.

939
01:05:24.602 --> 01:05:28.142
You haven't done a lot of things. I never expected that.

940
01:05:30.173 --> 01:05:31.343
That's true.

941
01:05:32.783 --> 01:05:36.053
I was always busy in my 20s.

942
01:05:37.582 --> 01:05:38.923
So I haven't done...

943
01:05:40.182 --> 01:05:41.892
a lot of things.

944
01:05:43.053 --> 01:05:45.262
I don't know a lot of things either.

945
01:05:47.992 --> 01:05:49.162
There's a poem...

946
01:05:50.233 --> 01:05:52.533
I liked when I was in my 20s.

947
01:05:54.403 --> 01:05:56.133
It goes like,

948
01:05:58.273 --> 01:05:59.903
"Meeting someone in life..."

949
01:06:01.003 --> 01:06:03.042
"is when someone's whole life comes along."

950
01:06:04.242 --> 01:06:05.613
"The heart is fragile."

951
01:06:06.443 --> 01:06:08.253
"Therefore, it might have been broken."

952
01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:11.582
"That heart is coming too."

953
01:06:13.483 --> 01:06:15.423
When I loved that poem,

954
01:06:16.992 --> 01:06:19.262
I didn't know what it meant.

955
01:06:20.493 --> 01:06:22.193
But when I found out the meaning,

956
01:06:24.163 --> 01:06:26.203
I couldn't like the poem anymore.

957
01:06:27.932 --> 01:06:29.233
There are a lot of things...

958
01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:33.172
you can never do again when you actually know about them.

959
01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:37.943
So I'm...

960
01:06:41.283 --> 01:06:42.953
envious of you, Ji Ho.

961
01:06:45.922 --> 01:06:47.283
You may not know about things,

962
01:06:48.752 --> 01:06:50.222
but it's a good thing.

963
01:06:53.523 --> 01:06:54.733
So...

964
01:06:55.863 --> 01:06:57.533
don't worry too much.

965
01:07:04.773 --> 01:07:06.273
It's the same to you, Se Hee.

966
01:07:08.672 --> 01:07:10.712
Even though you've seen a sea before,

967
01:07:12.012 --> 01:07:15.382
this sea you are looking at now is a different one.

968
01:07:16.913 --> 01:07:20.323
Even though you know it well, and even though you've done it before,

969
01:07:21.592 --> 01:07:25.663
Having the moment with that person is the first time for you.

970
01:07:29.663 --> 01:07:32.962
Like our marriage.

971
01:07:35.233 --> 01:07:37.273
Like the kiss at the bus stop.

972
01:07:40.602 --> 01:07:43.012
I believe what happens after those moments...

973
01:07:45.243 --> 01:07:47.882
is no one's fault.

974
01:07:49.352 --> 01:07:50.483
It...

975
01:07:51.953 --> 01:07:53.453
just happened to be that way.

976
01:07:55.793 --> 01:07:58.762
Like some waves keep on flowing...

977
01:07:59.922 --> 01:08:03.092
while the others break.

978
01:08:06.932 --> 01:08:08.873
It just happens that way.

979
01:08:09.432 --> 01:08:10.602
So...

980
01:08:12.903 --> 01:08:14.243
Se Hee,

981
01:08:15.613 --> 01:08:17.472
don't worry too much.

982
01:08:20.812 --> 01:08:22.583
It's not like...

983
01:08:24.113 --> 01:08:25.752
you know all about today...

984
01:08:27.123 --> 01:08:28.352
just because you lived yesterday.

985
01:08:30.993 --> 01:08:35.632
"Meeting someone in life is actually something astonishing."

986
01:08:38.002 --> 01:08:39.233
"That's because..."

987
01:08:40.333 --> 01:08:41.932
"someone's whole life comes along."

988
01:08:45.142 --> 01:08:46.573
"The heart is fragile."

989
01:08:48.312 --> 01:08:49.512
"Therefore,"

990
01:08:50.842 --> 01:08:52.312
"it might have been broken."

991
01:08:55.212 --> 01:08:56.382
"That heart..."

992
01:08:59.222 --> 01:09:00.422
"is coming too."

993
01:09:02.293 --> 01:09:05.422
Now I know why people go to the sea when they feel suffocated.

994
01:09:07.733 --> 01:09:11.432
You can face your heart here.

995
01:09:12.602 --> 01:09:13.703
What?

996
01:09:14.403 --> 01:09:19.172
By the way, there's something I've been wanting to correct.

997
01:09:20.972 --> 01:09:24.743
What you did at the bus stop isn't a kiss. It's more like a peck.

998
01:09:31.083 --> 01:09:32.382
Why did he have to...

999
01:09:33.653 --> 01:09:34.752
Okay.

1000
01:09:35.693 --> 01:09:37.793
In a way, it can't be called a peck either.

1001
01:09:38.193 --> 01:09:39.962
If I were to define it,

1002
01:09:40.493 --> 01:09:43.233
it'd more like lips making physical contact with other lips.

1003
01:09:43.663 --> 01:09:45.333
That should be the right definition.

1004
01:09:49.932 --> 01:09:52.602
Okay, I get it.

1005
01:09:52.972 --> 01:09:54.943
That can't be called a kiss.

1006
01:09:59.012 --> 01:10:00.812
That's not how you kiss someone.

1007
01:10:01.613 --> 01:10:04.382
Okay, I was bad at it.

1008
01:10:04.382 --> 01:10:07.823
Yes, exactly. This is...

1009
01:10:09.953 --> 01:10:11.293
how you kiss.

1010
01:10:39.983 --> 01:10:43.153
Do you get it now?

1011
01:10:45.123 --> 01:10:46.222
Or...

1012
01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.092
should we do it more?

1013
01:10:51.703 --> 01:10:54.373
I want to do it more.

1014
01:11:16.252 --> 01:11:17.793
His fragile heart.

1015
01:11:20.422 --> 01:11:23.363
The heart that might have been broken before.

1016
01:11:26.062 --> 01:11:27.432
His heart...

1017
01:11:32.773 --> 01:11:34.142
came to me.

1018
01:11:54.733 --> 01:11:58.432
(Because This Is My First Life)

1019
01:11:59.163 --> 01:12:02.932
I'm totally feeling the love.

1020
01:12:02.932 --> 01:12:04.903
She's pretty.

1021
01:12:04.903 --> 01:12:06.443
Don't you want to sleep with him?

1022
01:12:06.443 --> 01:12:08.543
I mean, you two live together.

1023
01:12:08.842 --> 01:12:10.573
Go wash up first.

1024
01:12:10.913 --> 01:12:12.613
Why did I do that?

1025
01:12:12.743 --> 01:12:16.153
I'm thinking about that kiss so many times a day.

1026
01:12:16.153 --> 01:12:17.682
You silly.

1027
01:12:19.283 --> 01:12:20.752
It's about our marriage.

1028
01:12:20.852 --> 01:12:23.092
Can you wait a little more?

1029
01:12:23.823 --> 01:12:26.363
I'm just curious about my girlfriend's house.

1030
01:12:26.993 --> 01:12:28.163
You're out.

1031
01:12:28.333 --> 01:12:32.102
What do young people do on a date these days?

1032
01:12:32.863 --> 01:12:34.533
I'm afraid of myself...

1033
01:12:34.972 --> 01:12:38.373
hurting someone again.
