Episode 4

4
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.640
What do you think? Do you like it?

5
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.800
It's nice. You must have worked hard.

6
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.520
Oh, not at all.

7
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.190
Now, the only thing left is to
run straight to the election.

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.940
As long as I have Manager Lee.

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.060
Oh, Principal Hong, you've come.

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.100
Oh, however, you look a little...

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.880
This is nice here. Really nice.
Yes.

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.920
Over there.
Why don't you sit comfortably and talk?

13
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.940
Please come in.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.380
Wow, this view is really nice.

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.180
It's really fine and very nice.

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.980
Please sit down.

17
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.860
Yes.

18
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.340
Why are you doing that?

19
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.920
Huh? Ah, nothing.

20
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.760
Should I get you a
cup of water at least?

21
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.500
No, that's okay. That's okay.

22
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.440
It's nice.

23
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.080
However, that creature, at least for the
time being, he'll be anxious, won't he?

24
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.820
The more I think about it,
the more it pleases me.

25
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.280
Then for us, what is our next plan?

26
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.200
Uh...

27
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.340
We're in the middle
of thinking about it.

28
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.400
We can just think about it.

29
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.280
We'll have to think about it.

30
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.840
Oh, here, here, here!

31
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.000
Oh, why are you going over there?

32
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.320
Stay quiet. Stay quiet. Stay quiet.

33
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.260
Are you crazy?

34
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.440
Where do you think this is
that you came here to find me?

35
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.620
If you come to find me one more time,
then...

36
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.140
Thanks to whom that you even have a
son who is like a gift from heaven?

37
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.000
I told you not to contact me first.

38
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.940
If you talk to the conspirator like
this, then I'm so disappointed.

39
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.720
So?

40
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.780
When are you going to sell the land?

41
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.200
That. It's not going to
be as easy as we thought.

42
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.880
I didn't know that he would
be so stridently against it.

43
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.800
Still, how can you let it happen that
the child ended up at the police station?

44
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.980
Well, how was I supposed to know that he
would show up that day like that?

45
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.440
Still, whether you look at it this way
or that, according to the law, it's mine.

46
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.400
So you just have to deal with him.

47
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.320
Don't just blame it on the child.
Just take care of it.

48
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.880
And don't do anything foolish.

49
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.460
Why are you leaving already?
I still have things to say.

50
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.480
Your nostrils! If you want to gain
something from me, then stay quiet.

51
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.870
I mean, am I the kind
of person who will stay

52
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.800
quiet just because I'm told to stay quiet?

53
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.180
Surely,
it's not that you have no plan, is it?

54
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.860
Anyway,
Madam and I have become colleagues.

55
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.020
I only judged that it would become
a bigger revenge against my husband.

56
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.250
Of course. It's win-win for both of us.

57
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.540
However, what shall I do
in the house from now on?

58
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.200
What?

59
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.880
Since we can't look
as if we're too close.

60
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.450
I don't think that is something
that you have to worry about.

61
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.880
How is it that the two of
you are coming in together?

62
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.060
Oh,
we met here at the front of the house.

63
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.600
Yah, if you ride this, your spirits
will really feel good. Try this on.

64
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.660
I said no.

65
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.063
There is the sincerity
of the person who came

66
00:04:35.263 --> 00:04:37.340
here to see you.
So, aren't you being too much?

67
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.140
Baek Seo Yeon!

68
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.320
Seo Yeon.

69
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.320
A little while ago downstairs,
I saw you with a boy.

70
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.460
Who is he?

71
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.760
He's a friend, of course.

72
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.680
A friend? Who?

73
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.300
If I tell you, would you even know him?

74
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.280
Is he a close friend?

75
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.940
Why? What is it that you want to know?

76
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.600
It's just...
Seo Yeon, perhaps, at your school

77
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.560
do you know Hee Soo?

78
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.080
How does mom know him?

79
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.320
Oh, he's the son of a close friend.

80
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.020
And the child seems very nice.

81
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.720
Why? Do you wish you had a son like him?

82
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.320
No!

83
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.680
How could... No. It's not that.

84
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.800
Hee Soo has been bullied
by some bad kids at school.

85
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.180
What does Mom know to
speak badly of my friends?!

86
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.600
You... you also bullied him with them?

87
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.540
Yes. Is there a reason
why I can't do that?

88
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.660
Seo Yeon!

89
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.440
So annoying.

90
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.300
Seo Yeon!

91
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.480
Why do you go around
with kids like that?!

92
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.800
Seo Yeon!

93
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.060
Seo Yeon!

94
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.180
Talk to Mom! Okay?

95
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.280
Seo Yeon!

96
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.880
You can't hang around
with kids like that!

97
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.260
Seo Yeon!

98
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.500
Seo Yeon!

99
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.060
Seo Yeon!

100
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.940
Uh?

101
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.240
Right now? I understand.

102
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.400
Soo Gyum! Soo Gyum!

103
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.740
Son! Soo Gyum!

104
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.380
I think he wants to see you. That's why
he's pushing his meeting and coming by.

105
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.640
You know what's important to do, right?

106
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.060
Yes.

107
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.880
You have to mind your manners
and greet him properly.

108
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.600
Yes.

109
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.080
He's coming.

110
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.180
Father, you've come.

111
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.480
If you had told me earlier,
we would have come to the airport.

112
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.200
Get in.

113
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:31.780
Yes.

114
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.260
Soo Gyum, get in over there
next to your grandfather.

115
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.880
Aren't you going in?

116
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.800
However... Isn't there something a bit
strange about that kid as you look at him?

117
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.821
He seems okay,
but then occasionally when you look

118
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:18.920
at him,
you can't tell at all what he's thinking.

119
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.240
Didn't you feel that?

120
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.820
Who would the son resemble?

121
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.260
I mean, you.
No matter how much you're like that

122
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.340
You couldn't even just say "Father,
you've come."

123
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.200
Is it my fault that
you were pushed aside?

124
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.900
Pushed aside? Me?

125
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.820
To whom?

126
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.000
You're making a lot of effort.

127
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.980
That's why.
If only you didn't have that flaw...

128
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.200
No. That is...
what I'm trying to say is...

129
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.440
It's not that I'm saying
it's your fault...

130
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.600
It's because I'm flawed
that I met a man like you.

131
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.860
Hello?

132
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.880
Yes.

133
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.860
Yes. I understand.

134
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.660
You've come?

135
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.460
Yes.

136
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.040
Oh, he's good looking!

137
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.720
He must be your grandson.

138
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.980
Give me a large portion of that.

139
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.020
What would you like?

140
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.140
I'll have blood stew.

141
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.160
He's definitely your grandson.

142
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.560
Blood stew two of them!

143
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.922
My sons, because they
have delicate digestive

144
00:10:05.122 --> 00:10:07.160
systems, have never eaten that with me.

145
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.040
Since I was very young, on market days,

146
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.400
it's something I ate with my
grandmother. So I like it.

147
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.200
Really?

148
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.420
Have a delicious meal.

149
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.280
You must think about
your grandmother a lot.

150
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.380
Yes.

151
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.840
They said that you came
as soon as she was buried.

152
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.600
Why did you rush too much?

153
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.980
I was curious about the family
who came looking for me now.

154
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.800
So now that you've seen them,
how do they look?

155
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.620
What kind of a person do you think I am?

156
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.040
Like a chairman.

157
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.120
So I guess I don't seem like
a grandfather to you then.

158
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.540
What kind of a grandson does
Grandfather want me to be?

159
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.120
Let's find out as we go.

160
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.400
Let's eat.

161
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.060
Yes. I'll eat well.

162
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.250
One hour before the event,
we will plan to have a rehearsal.

163
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.880
For a doctor's conference,
isn't this a little too small?

164
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.820
We'll change the location.

165
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.020
The conference room?

166
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.640
Yes. Please come this way.

167
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.160
So, you've gained a son?

168
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.040
If something like that happens, isn't it
good manners to tell the family properly?

169
00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.180
Your husband telling Jeong Jun
just in passing isn't enough.

170
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.080
I didn't have a chance to do so.

171
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.920
Of course, it must have been that.

172
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.320
Has the Chairman seen the son yet?

173
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.560
Yes.

174
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.300
What will you do?

175
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.200
If he were young, you might had at least
a chance to develop some affection.

176
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.150
You should think it's a
relief that he's all grown up.

177
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.940
Bring the child to Mother's birthday.

178
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.180
We should see his face at least.

179
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.980
What?
Did you have something more to say?

180
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.900
No.

181
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.400
Mi Sook!

182
00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.360
This turned out well.

183
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.380
However, what kind of a place is this?

184
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.680
Unnie came along, too?

185
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.220
Should I leave now?

186
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.920
No. I just...

187
00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.360
Let's go. Let's go.

188
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
You are saying that if you do this,
you're able to relieve your stress?

189
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.460
I seem to have cut this.

190
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.260
How is Madam doing with this?

191
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.020
Are you relieving some stress?

192
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.480
Ah!

193
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.850
This does completely
relieve the stress anyway.

194
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.800
Oh! Omona. You're a specialist!
A specialist.

195
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.120
Omo, what in the world.

196
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.540
She can be proud of herself. Very proud.

197
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.640
We did well.

198
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.810
It must have been the first
time for our Madam as well.

199
00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.280
I just wondered if it would
relieve some of our stress.

200
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.280
Did something happen to you today?

201
00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.460
It's okay now since I've met you, Unnie.

202
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.820
That's right. Whenever you get stressed,
just call us over.

203
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.880
However, today,
where shall we go for a second round?

204
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.480
Why? Do you have to go home?

205
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.040
No.

206
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.360
However, is Hee Soo okay?

207
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.720
Oh, he's able to take care of his dinner
by himself just fine.

208
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.800
That's not what I meant...

209
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.300
I just wondered if the student Jung Wook
wasn't still harassing him afterwards.

210
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:41.460
It also continues to worry me. But Hee Soo
just keeps saying that things are fine.

211
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.720
Oh, right!

212
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.460
Did you say her name was Seo Yeon?

213
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.180
Yes?

214
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.900
Your daughter!

215
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.960
I've been meaning to ask Hee Soo
about her, but I keep forgetting.

216
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.620
Let's go. Let's go.

217
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.320
Oh! What are you doing here, darling?

218
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.760
Oh. Yes. I. That is...

219
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.675
I asked to see her.
I thought we could exercise

220
00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:11.740
together in order to become
closer to each other.

221
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.840
Oh, really?

222
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Oh. Get in! Get in!

223
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.800
Go. Go. I can just go by myself.

224
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.780
We just came to play some screen golf
and are about to go out for dinner.

225
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.700
It's good that it turned out this way.

226
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.820
Why don't you come with us? I had wanted
to invite you for dinner some time, anyway.

227
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.500
Isn't that right?

228
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.340
Ayy...

229
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.760
No matter whether you say this or that,

230
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.080
a woman without a husband
is the most pitiful.

231
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.900
Now, why am I shaking this? Ayy...

232
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.080
Oh, what a waste. This.

233
00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.940
I think we may know each other.

234
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.660
I'm sorry! (in Japanese)

235
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.900
Aigoo. You're putting on quite a show.

236
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.620
Our eyes had met!

237
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.280
You shove this in your mouth!

238
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.280
I'm sorry!

239
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.100
Aigoo! What is this?!

240
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.820
Hey, you Ajumma! Oh!

241
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.720
When did I meet your eyes?

242
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.160
Stop putting up that
unbelievable pretense.

243
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.480
Ajumma!

244
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.680
That day, you were dressed shabbily
like this as well!

245
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.040
You've mistaken me for someone else.

246
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.540
Ajumma!

247
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.820
Because of Ajumma,
I had to wear a cast for a long time

248
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.500
and damaged my elbow!

249
00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.282
Because of that, I couldn't work.
The treatment

250
00:18:44.482 --> 00:18:46.320
bill and for suffering mental anguish...

251
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:47.920
So how much is all of that...

252
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.660
Don't lie! You look perfectly fine.

253
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.720
Lie?

254
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.980
How dare this woman injure a man and
then raise her voice?! I should just...

255
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.950
Why did you come here so early?

256
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.830
What?

257
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.470
Who is this man?

258
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.420
Oh.

259
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.210
It's raining. Let's get in.

260
00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.250
Hey.

261
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.500
What happened?

262
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.000
Aigoo.

263
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.250
Drink slowly.

264
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.240
By the way how did you two meet?

265
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.640
Why? We don't match?

266
00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.880
No,

267
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.180
because you two look good.

268
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.930
You followed her around a lot, right?

269
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.930
I did.

270
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.350
She was so nice and beautiful,

271
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.000
far too good for me.

272
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.810
Then you must treat her well even now?

273
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.480
Ah.

274
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.860
Of course.

275
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.613
I watched the news yesterday.
A famous professor was

276
00:20:19.813 --> 00:20:21.850
proven to be a criminal,
guilty of domestic violence.

277
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.860
Are you alright?

278
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.860
Yes.

279
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.130
Yes. I heard your son who is studying
abroad is so good at his studies.

280
00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:34.890
He was.

281
00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.840
Should we consider also sending
our son abroad to study?

282
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.840
Whatever.

283
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.720
My son.

284
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.230
Seo Jin.

285
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.810
Excuse me.
I don't feel good in my stomach,

286
00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.810
I will get up ahead.

287
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.320
Sunbae, why don't you go with her?
She's alright.

288
00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.640
Then why don't you go with her?

289
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.250
Drink slowly.

290
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.160
Unnie.

291
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.940
Why are you doing this,
making me feel uncomfortable?

292
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.260
Until when will you just avoid it?

293
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.160
It's my family matter.

294
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.540
It's also an Avengers Club matter.
I...

295
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.960
need more time.

296
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.960
I will go ahead.

297
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.410
Jung Hye,

298
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.410
I'm going to Hong Do Unnie.

299
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.770
I have something to tell her.
I have something to tell her, too.

300
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.560
Right.

301
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.560
You should listen, too.

302
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.920
Eh?
I will tell you after we get there.

303
00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.240
Have some.

304
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.440
Because it is said that
chamomile has a soothing effect.

305
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.570
I can't get the taste.

306
00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.010
Ah.

307
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:16.000
Camo... It is.

308
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.000
Thanks.

309
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.390
Leave them.

310
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.390
Are you okay?

311
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.570
Didn't you get hurt?
I'm okay.

312
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.620
What should I do with this?
I did it again.

313
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.620
I will surely pay for it.

314
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.840
No.

315
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.470
The phone.

316
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:27.240
Umm.

317
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.510
Are you coming now?

318
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.510
I see.

319
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.730
I think I'll be leaving now.

320
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.950
But it's still raining.
It's ok.

321
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:52.590
Wait a moment.

322
00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.350
Use this while you're going home.

323
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.680
This alley is

324
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.690
rather dangerous for a woman
to walk alone at night.

325
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.510
Please go home safely.

326
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.140
A woman? Who me? DH is talking to herself
about how she could be seen as a woman.

327
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:54.940
<i>Seo Yeon,</i>

328
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.490
<i>Let's please talk today.</i>

329
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.020
<i>I trust you, Seo Yeon.</i>

330
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.770
<i>I am just worried.</i>

331
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.280
<i>If you keep going around
with bad friends...</i>

332
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.210
Why did they come?
Get off, get off.

333
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.120
Hey wake up.

334
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:17.820
She will never ride it.

335
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.830
Why are you doing this?

336
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.360
Hee Soo!

337
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.550
Mom!

338
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.060
Hello.

339
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.420
Hey, hold tight.

340
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.810
Hee Soo!

341
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.630
Hee Soo!

342
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.240
Are you alright?
Are you okay?

343
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.240
Can you stand up?

344
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:38.010
Mom.

345
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.090
Aish.

346
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.600
I'm screwed.

347
00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.760
Hey, go!
Uh?

348
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.350
I said go quickly,

349
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.460
Hey, Hwang Jung Wook!

350
00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.440
That punk!
Seo Yeon!

351
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.700
Are you alright? Aren't you hurt?

352
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.170
What happened?
You saw it all.

353
00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.120
Seo Yeon.

354
00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.120
What's this?

355
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.750
Your daughter?

356
00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.975
But why was she with Jung Wook?

357
00:27:18.175 --> 00:27:19.870
No she isn't.
We're friends.

358
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.350
Seo Yeon.

359
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.770
Weren't you accomplices?

360
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.140
You should state that clearly.

361
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.820
Hyung, did you know her?

362
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:47.820
Yes. Just randomly.

363
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.274
How much your mother
must have been surprised.

364
00:27:55.474 --> 00:27:56.280
None of your business.

365
00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.270
It's a relief you're only hurt this much.
It could have been much more serious.

366
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.240
It's all because of you.

367
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.610
You already know it, didn't you?

368
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.830
Unnie, you said you have
something to talk about.

369
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.830
Why don't you say something?

370
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.680
My Seo Yeon...

371
00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.510
is indeed a friend with Jung Wook.

372
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.080
So...

373
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.660
you're saying your daughter is
one of the party with Jung Wook?

374
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:46.570
No.

375
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.750
That wouldn't be so.

376
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.180
She is just a friend of them,

377
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.180
but she wouldn't do that.

378
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.220
My kid just met wrong friends...
Just met wrong friends?

379
00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.530
That's what all parents say.

380
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.170
You also

381
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.690
want to say that your
daughter is innocent.

382
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:09.914
It's not like that.

383
00:29:10.114 --> 00:29:12.110
What's the difference between
you and Jung Wook's mom?

384
00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.570
Unnie, that's not so.

385
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.770
Please consider Mi Sook Unnie's stance,
too.

386
00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:18.760
Consider?

387
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.320
Consider what at this situation?

388
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.780
How can you say that seeing all that
Hee Soo and I had suffered?

389
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.640
You guys don't know.

390
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.830
All that's left to me
is just my children.

391
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.600
You never know every morning,

392
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.030
how I feel seeing Hee
Soo's back going to school.

393
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.150
I can't even show my worried face
because it may hurt his heart.

394
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.230
I think...

395
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.510
I can't help it.

396
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.510
I don't deserve to be...

397
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.520
in Avengers Club.

398
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.070
No, that should not be.

399
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.490
Unnie!

400
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.490
OK. Then quit it.

401
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:08.940
Mom!

402
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.090
Apologize to Hee Soo and his mother,
come on.

403
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.600
Quickly.

404
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:27.660
Seo Yeon!

405
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.810
Hee Soo, I'm sorry.

406
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.400
Mom, I'm okay.

407
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.720
Taxi! Taxi!

408
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.060
Why do you want to spend the money?
Let's take the bus.

409
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.590
Do you really want to see
Mom die of heartache?

410
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.560
Mom will not save money anymore.

411
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.070
Even if I don't have any,
I'm going to live as if I have it.

412
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.530
So that you won't be disdained.

413
00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.900
Why are you overreacting?

414
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.580
I've never been disdained.
I'm disdaining them.

415
00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.860
As if, Jung Wook,
that one guy wasn't enough,

416
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:28.860
it was Seo Yeon, that girl, as well.

417
00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:30.860
Please stop.

418
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:33.120
Today was the first time
I even knew her name was

419
00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.150
Baek Seo Yeon.
She was only riding in the back.

420
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.150
She got hurt more than I did.

421
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.120
Who is worrying about whom right now?

422
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.120
Mom,

423
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.120
I'm more worried about you.

424
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.290
The mom who worries only
about me is my worry.

425
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.445
Everest, 8,848 K2, 8,611

426
00:32:12.645 --> 00:32:15.450
Kangchenjunga, 8,586

427
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.120
Lohtse, 8,516 Majalu, 8,363

428
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.120
Cho Oyu, 8,201

429
00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.880
Baek Seo Yeon.

430
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.680
Baek Seo Yeon.

431
00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.843
If you have something to say, do it later.
Now Seo Yeon is...

432
00:32:32.043 --> 00:32:33.040
Baek Seo Yeon, come here.

433
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:36.830
Baek Seo Yeon, come here.

434
00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.280
What's this?

435
00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:42.280
What are you doing around?

436
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.280
Aigoo, just leave her alone.

437
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.670
You aren't causing any trouble, are you?

438
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.800
You're the daughter of a
Superintendent of Education candidate.

439
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.710
You should have asked if I was alright.

440
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.432
Go in, Seo Yeon.

441
00:32:56.632 --> 00:32:59.160
You always protect her like
this that's why she's like that!

442
00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.700
I see, so let's talk.
You get in quickly.

443
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:04.700
Now more than ever, you must...

444
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.820
You...

445
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.710
Should you do it?

446
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.212
More than the Superintendent of Education
election, what's more urgent to us is...

447
00:33:14.412 --> 00:33:15.580
It's all for our family...

448
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.860
Don't you know?

449
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.150
It's for you.

450
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:25.870
Seo Yeon.

451
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.200
Seo Yeon. It's alright. Mom is sorry.

452
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.330
Mom is sorry. Seo Yeon. Mom did wrong.

453
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.180
It's alright. It's alright.

454
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.000
Seo Yeon. It's alright. I'm sorry.

455
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.000
It's alright. It's alright.

456
00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.470
It's alright. It's alright. Seo Yeon.

457
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.000
It's alright. It's alright. Seo Yeon.

458
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.230
Mom did wrong. Mom is sorry. Seo Yeon.

459
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.610
Seo Yeon. It's alright. It's alright

460
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:55.070
Look at Mom! Mom is...

461
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.790
The ajummas will reconcile soon.

462
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.320
They should.

463
00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:05.120
Surely...

464
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.060
You aren't worried that the Avengers
Club would really be broken, are you?

465
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.880
That you might not be
able to take revenge?

466
00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.000
It's not that kind of matter.

467
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.520
Eh, don't worry.

468
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:20.520
I will really do well.

469
00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:22.890
My son is very sociable.

470
00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.120
Hmm, isn't he?

471
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.800
You ate ox blood soup with Grandfather.

472
00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.640
You're getting along with Mom well. Hmm?

473
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.760
Have you come?

474
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.690
My son,

475
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.360
how will you please me?

476
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.200
I'll prepare a gift for mother-in-law.

477
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.840
You don't have to take care of it.
I'll go there by myself.

478
00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:52.960
What's your secret to getting along well
with your step mother?

479
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:55.960
I've lived with her for 10 years,
but I still don't know.

480
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.680
Ma'am, your flower bouquet is ready.

481
00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.688
You have to make a good
impression to the maternal elders.

482
00:35:22.888 --> 00:35:23.290
Yes.

483
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.910
Aren't we meeting Mother
first before we go in?

484
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.110
Just come along.

485
00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.930
Oh, Hyung!

486
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.620
Have you been well?
Ah, yes.

487
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.630
This is your uncle.
You should greet him.

488
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.200
Hello. How are you?

489
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.720
He seems to both resemble you
and not resemble you

490
00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:43.770
at the same time.

491
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.420
Anyway, he's good looking.

492
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.570
Well, of course.
That means that he resembles me.

493
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:51.770
Yes.

494
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.700
You're here.
It would've been okay, though,

495
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.010
if you had done as you usually do
and just sent a present.

496
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.630
This time, I wanted to show you
the present directly myself.

497
00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.710
Now, you won't have to worry about
your daughter or me anymore.

498
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:11.950
Greet them.

499
00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.140
My name is Lee Soo Gyum.

500
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.130
Happy birthday,

501
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.160
Grandmother.

502
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.280
Byung Soo, you'll walk on a flower path
from now on. <i>(Live an easy life)</i>

503
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.420
Perhaps.

504
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.840
He has a way of upending
flower paths after all.

505
00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.579
Occasionally,
the dirt has to be turned over so

506
00:36:34.779 --> 00:36:36.320
that the farming can
continue for a long time.

507
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.950
And do you have a
contract for the farming?

508
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.780
Of course!

509
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.110
I already put in place all the
plans for setting up a new hotel.

510
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.080
They say you've gotten ahold
of a decent possibility.

511
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:46.890
I guess that's true.

512
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.790
Where is it?

513
00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.300
I'll discuss it with you separately.

514
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.520
You came?

515
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.450
Happy birthday.

516
00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.440
Thank you.

517
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.560
She's already received the present.

518
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.060
A very special present.

519
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.150
You'll now be able to
sympathize with mom's feelings.

520
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.070
You can understand that kid's
stance more than anyone.

521
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:10.990
Jung Min...

522
00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.600
Oh, you didn't know?

523
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.100
Since you both have the same background,

524
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.110
isn't it a relief?

525
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.040
Noona, that's enough.

526
00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.500
I'm sorry.

527
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.080
I'll leave first.

528
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:30.810
Why?

529
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.100
At least have some cake.

530
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.140
Noona, why are you eating mine?
Then, you can eat some of mine, too.

531
00:38:59.160 --> 00:38:59.980
Your fa...

532
00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.810
I'm sorry, Unnie.

533
00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.560
I told you not to call me your unnie.

534
00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.620
Oh, wait.

535
00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.250
How many years are there between you?

536
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.460
It must be embarrassing for you
to be called mom.

537
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.870
How can you live in the same house
together when it must be so uncomfortable?

538
00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:39.630
It's fine.

539
00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.060
Mother treats me very well.

540
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:43.850
Ohhh.

541
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:46.780
Your disposition is very good.

542
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.860
Because being born...

543
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.450
is not this child's fault.

544
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.210
<i>The call cannot be connected.</i>

545
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:38.760
<i>My Son The call cannot be connected.</i>

546
00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:38.960
<i>My Son</i>

547
00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.580
<i>Sweetheart</i>

548
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.450
<i>The call cannot be connected.</i>

549
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.370
So everyone is avoiding me. Is that it?

550
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.120
That's enough. Let her be by herself.

551
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.320
Even still...

552
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:19.310
<i>Han Soo Ji</i>

553
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.980
That was the first time
I saw you laugh so much.

554
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.480
Because it was the first time

555
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.840
that I said what I wanted to say
in front of those people.

556
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.290
All this time,
have you been restraining yourself?

557
00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:02.560
Now I won't anymore.

558
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.350
I made the Avengers Club after all.

559
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.350
That's right.

560
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:08.350
So now don't restrain yourself.

561
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.600
Since there is nothing
that we've done wrong.

562
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.620
Oh, that...

563
00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:19.450
By the way,

564
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.320
Have the ajummas made up?

565
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:23.470
They will have to.

566
00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.160
So about that...

567
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:55.920
Oh, Soo Gyum?

568
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:27.160
Yes, Soo Gyum?
Ajumma, something bad happened!

569
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.120
What happened?

570
00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:35.900
Soo Gyum!

571
00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:40.650
What happened?

572
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.740
Then, I'll go first.

573
00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:57.530
What happened?
He said you're in trouble.

574
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.050
What's going on?

575
00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.540
I don't have money.

576
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.550
W-what did she say?

577
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.360
Can we really eat these here?

578
00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.990
Why does it look so empty?

579
00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.150
I rented the place.

580
00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.350
The whole place?

581
00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.740
Do you really want to...

582
00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.490
call off the Avengers Club?

583
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.760
You say something...

584
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.630
It... It's my fault...

585
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:20.520
You did what?

586
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.340
It was me who overreacted.

587
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:31.530
I asked Hee Soo, and he said...

588
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.850
your daughter didn't join them.

589
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:36.350
I was wrong.

590
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:43.470
So...

591
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:45.600
Should we stop or not?

592
00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.690
What do you mean? We just started.

593
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.570
I'm not someone who eats and runs.

594
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.260
It's because I'm inadequate.

595
00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.200
It's all my fault.

596
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:01.040
What do you lack?

597
00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.990
You have your husband and child.

598
00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:04.860
I'm still alive, too.

599
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.100
But still...

600
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:16.920
I'm still living, too.

601
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:22.590
Today is my mom's birthday.

602
00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:25.360
It's a great day, so why?

603
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:29.420
I'm like Hong Gil Dong.

604
00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.820
I can't call Mom as Mom...

605
00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:37.100
and I can't call Unnie as Unnie.

606
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.260
Is she drunk?

607
00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.280
Well,
she hasn't even finished one glass.

608
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.880
But you two...

609
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.820
You have your family.

610
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.170
To be honest...

611
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:53.770
I am similar to Soo Gyum.

612
00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.140
No.

613
00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.250
At least Soo Gyum knows
his mother's face.

614
00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.350
So...

615
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:12.800
Shall we call it off?

616
00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:14.320
Or not?

617
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.530
Of course not!

618
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.520
I thought you owned the whole world...

619
00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.180
We are now your sisters.

620
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:48.200
That's right.

621
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.080
Your sister is here.

622
00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.590
Avengers Club...

623
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:09.820
Avengers Club...

624
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.040
Fighting!

625
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:12.680
Bottoms up!

626
00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.740
It feels strange to drink
soju from this glass.

627
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:24.380
My goodness!

628
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.029
Aigoo, you were starving for a drink.
If we hadn't given it to you,

629
00:48:28.229 --> 00:48:29.340
you might not have been
able to go to sleep.

630
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:30.010
You said bottoms up...

631
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.550
You did well. You did well.

632
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.110
Aigoo, drink well.

633
00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.080
Here, have some more.

634
00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.890
Let's drink and die.

635
00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.190
Cheers!

636
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:48.380
Bottoms up!

637
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.330
Omona!

638
00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.740
Omo! Hey, excuse me!

639
00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:59.740
I! I am Soo Gyum's mother.
Omo! Omo! Omo!

640
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:00.830
Omo! Omo!

641
00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:03.290
Omona! Excuse me? Excuse me!

642
00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.200
You can't go inside! Omo!
I'm going inside!

643
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:06.360
Ah! You can't go inside!

644
00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.850
Oh my god...

645
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:15.470
Hey,

646
00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.600
Who are you?
Oh my god...

647
00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.820
Oh my god, my goodness...

648
00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.680
This is totally my style.

649
00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.440
You'll get me in trouble!

650
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:26.600
I like it here so much.

651
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.910
So... Let's have a look around?

652
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:35.870
Hey, look here...

653
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.640
You can't go in there!

654
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:39.370
That's Madam's room.

655
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:42.360
Oh, is that so?

656
00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:46.400
I thought it was my son's room.

657
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:48.170
Soo Gyum's room is on the second floor.

658
00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.080
Follow me.

659
00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.340
Hey, you! Hey!

660
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.170
Omo! Omo! Open the door!

661
00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:09.530
Open the door!

662
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.350
Ahhh...

663
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.350
This is it?

664
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.340
Hey!

665
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.220
Wow...

666
00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.540
Hey!

667
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:21.240
Ahh, totally my style...

668
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.960
Open the door!

669
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:23.550
So nice!

670
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.360
Hey!

671
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.040
Omo...

672
00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:43.180
This suits me

673
00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:45.200
so perfectly.

674
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:48.040
See!

675
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:49.980
This is the construction proposal.

676
00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:51.690
It's for the school.

677
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.750
This is for the new school building
and other facilities.

678
00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.280
So that the construction runs smoothly,
the windows...

679
00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:00.800
<i>I couldn't contact you,
so I came to your house.</i>

680
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.050
Are you crazy!?
<i>What time will you get off from work?</i>

681
00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:03.900
Damn!

682
00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.530
<i>Son!</i>

683
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:07.440
<i>Why didn't you pick up the phone?</i>

684
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.260
<i>I'm worried, so I came to see you.
</i>Damn

685
00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.370
<i>Son, your house is not bad.</i>

686
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:15.450
Hyung!

687
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.720
Madam will come home soon.
Please leave immediately.

688
00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.400
I say...

689
00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.240
Can you get me something to drink?

690
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.320
Something expensive.

691
00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:34.280
If I do, will you leave?

692
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.670
Ahhh... So good.

693
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:46.440
Take it.

694
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.370
Today, it's our treat.

695
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.940
Go home.

696
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.080
What the hell do you think you're doing?

697
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.250
So hot! I was nearly burned!

698
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:16.220
You came?
Leave right this very minute!

699
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.280
Ouch, what are you doing?! It's not like
I went somewhere I can't go to!

700
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:19.950
Hey!

701
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.220
Why! What is it!

702
00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:25.420
Son, you're here.

703
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:27.950
Oh, Soo Gyum, go settle your mom.

704
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:29.160
What's up with him?

705
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.030
Let's go out.

706
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:35.130
No.. No.. Ah, I'm coming.
Ah! Ah! Let's have dinner!

707
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:36.380
Only us! Ah! I'm leaving!

708
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.440
Ah, ah, ah! Ouch, ouch, ouch...

709
00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.750
Startled me...

710
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:44.650
Fine, I know! I'm leaving, I'm leaving!

711
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:45.680
But...

712
00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.190
Now you know the consequences
of ignoring me, right?

713
00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.230
Damn it!

714
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.520
Damn it?

715
00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:54.250
No matter how hard you deny it.

716
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.900
I'm still your mother,
and that's never going to change.

717
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:00.640
Pick up the phone.

718
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.600
Really, what were you doing?

719
00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.650
I'm sorry.

720
00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:31.550
Why should she be sorry?

721
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:34.250
You should apologize first.

722
00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:37.000
Why? Why should I? She came here first.

723
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.750
As a father, you should have handled it.

724
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:31.225
For causing hardships for you in
so many ways, I'm sorry.

725
00:54:31.425 --> 00:54:34.500
For things that are not your fault,
don't keep apologizing.

726
00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:37.700
If it was something that I
could resolve by trying...

727
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:41.450
well, then I would have
tried whatever I could.

728
00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:46.950
Why someone like that gave birth to me,
I really don't know.

729
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:52.600
Even a mother like that,
at least you can meet her.

730
00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.300
I also thought that at first.

731
00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:08.700
However, it might have been better
had I rather not known her.

732
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:14.250
There is no one who gets to be born
choosing their own parents.

733
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:36.800
Yes?

734
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.850
Your delivery is here.

735
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.000
You didn't have to bring so much.

736
00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.700
It's said that it's good for dementia
patients if they often move their fingers.

737
00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:02.100
I'm sorry you had to come here.

738
00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:05.300
It's a good place to have a meeting to
make our plans. And, it's so natural.

739
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.600
Excuse me for a moment.
I need to use the bathroom.

740
00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.450
Your mother-in-law looks so serene.

741
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.600
She's like a mother to me.

742
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:19.800
Mother-in-law?

743
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:22.400
Hello.

744
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:27.000
The sisters... why?

745
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.700
Mother-in-law...

746
00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.850
Are these friends here to visit?

747
00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:36.000
That's right, we're friends.

748
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:41.850
This one seems like a much,
much younger sister.

749
00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:43.350
Hello.

750
00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:46.250
Mother, how could you say she looks like
a much, much younger sister?

751
00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:49.600
That might make me the much,
much oldest sister. Very sad.

752
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.550
Mother, are you in a good mood?

753
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:56.850
Yes, I am.

754
00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.000
My friends bought some tangerines.

755
00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:02.550
Mom, please try some of this.

756
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:05.350
My marketplace is known for its fruits.

757
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.650
Seeing you smile, you're a girl.

758
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.800
I had a dream.

759
00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:22.050
What did you dream about?

760
00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.350
This is a secret.

761
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:32.300
Today...

762
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.650
my grandson is coming.

763
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.750
That would be nice.

764
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.900
Yes, it'll be nice.

765
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:49.050
It's going to be a good day.

766
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.600
Yeobo, you didn't say you would come. How...
<i>(yeobo means honey or darling)</i>

767
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.600
I had a meeting near here.

768
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.600
Mom, I'm here.

769
00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:31.650
You, horrible man.

770
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:37.900
Mom?

771
00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:39.900
Get out!

772
00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.700
Go!

773
00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:44.725
Mother, what are you doing?

774
00:58:44.925 --> 00:58:47.750
Horrible man! Get out! Go!

775
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.850
Mom, why are you doing this?

776
00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:53.350
Bring my Seo Jin. My Seo Jin.

777
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:55.850
Bring me my grandson, you jerk!

778
00:58:56.550 --> 00:59:00.400
Please stop it! Seo Jin is dead!

779
00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.750
I did wrong.

780
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:21.550
I made a mistake. I made a mistake.

781
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.850
Mother, it's okay.

782
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.425
I made a mistake.

783
00:59:29.625 --> 00:59:31.650
It's alright.

784
00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:32.650
Mom...

785
00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:34.850
Please don't hit me!

786
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.700
Young Pyo, please leave. This is not
good for your mother's blood pressure.

787
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.350
I made a mistake, yeobo.

788
00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:51.750
I made a mistake, please don't hit me.
Don't hit me.

789
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:53.950
I made a mistake, yeobo.

790
00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:57.950
Please leave now.

791
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.600
I made a mistake. I made a mistake.
I made a mistake...

792
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.700
Mother, it's okay.

793
01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:11.800
Please calm down. It's ok. It's ok.

794
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:35.700
It's okay. It's okay.

795
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.900
Mi Sook...

796
01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:59.900
Mi Sook, I feel so...

797
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.050
Please don't cry.

798
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:35.850
Mi Sook, don't cry.

799
01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.050
Young Pyo! Young Pyo!

800
01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:43.000
Stop it!

801
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.775
This is Seo Jin's.

802
01:02:45.975 --> 01:02:48.550
Stop it. Enough!

803
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:51.300
Enough of this.

804
01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.450
Seo Jin...

805
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:34.050
No longer will I live
just accepting everything.

806
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:35.600
That's right.

807
01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.850
Let me pay back some
of the debt I owe you.

808
01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:40.350
The exchange of revenge service
has to be done properly.

809
01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:42.700
It's no longer an exchange of services.

810
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.700
Starting now, we're family.

811
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.950
We live together, we die together.

812
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:51.600
Your revenge is my revenge.

813
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:54.150
Wait a moment.

814
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:57.100
Why?
