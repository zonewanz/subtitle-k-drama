00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:11.614
I will announce the results of
the advertising campaign now.

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.798
175 votes for Geo Food Life.

4
00:00:15.902 --> 00:00:19.339
207 votes for SH Food System.

5
00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.275
As for Jung Family Corporation...

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.382
they got 638 votes.

7
00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.151
And as for Strongest
Deliveryman Corporation...

8
00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:35.789
they got 787 votes!

9
00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:42.929
- Whoa!
- Yes!

10
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.938
The Strongest Deliveryman
Corporation has won the vote.

11
00:00:51.938 --> 00:00:53.006
Thank you.

12
00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:21.835
What do you think is the
reason why we lost?

13
00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:25.705
Simply put, it seems that Strongest
Deliveryman's emotional marketing worked.

14
00:01:25.705 --> 00:01:28.575
They planted the idea in people's
heads that they deliver

15
00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:30.410
not only food, but kindness as well.

16
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.611
And the restaurant owners in
Restaurant Row

17
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:33.780
greeted customers
like they were family.

18
00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:37.917
That much is in our
company's own manual, too!

19
00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:40.253
It says in there that customers must be
greeted with genuine warmth

20
00:01:40.253 --> 00:01:43.089
and not a forced, mechanical
sense of kindness!

21
00:01:45.058 --> 00:01:46.793
So, why?

22
00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:49.396
Why is it that our genuine feelings
could not be conveyed

23
00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:52.232
while theirs were?
That's my question!

24
00:01:52.232 --> 00:01:58.138
I want resignation letters from all the
Head Managers except Ms. Son Young Ah.

25
00:01:58.605 --> 00:01:59.973
What?

26
00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:01.641
None of you offered up any
creative ideas

27
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:04.077
except for Head Manager Son.

28
00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:05.879
To put it simply

29
00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.083
you all did not have an earnest
desire to win this fight!

30
00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:14.087
I don't need people who
passively follow the manual

31
00:02:14.087 --> 00:02:16.890
and do nothing else but
collect their paychecks!

32
00:02:17.857 --> 00:02:19.626
Submit your resignation
letters immediately!

33
00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:21.594
It's unfair of you to
fire us like this.

34
00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:26.232
Report me, then!
I'll pay the fine!

35
00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:28.168
Get out, all of you.

36
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.978
Eat up!
Yes!

37
00:02:38.978 --> 00:02:42.382
Oh, you need to be rung up?
Did you enjoy the food?

38
00:02:42.382 --> 00:02:44.617
Oh, yes, welcome!
Please take a seat here!

39
00:02:44.617 --> 00:02:47.220
We also deliver, so please
use that service a lot, too!

40
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.221
<i>[Lunch Special]</i>

41
00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:49.322
Ah, welcome!

42
00:02:49.322 --> 00:02:50.924
- Yes, welcome!
- Here you are.

43
00:02:50.924 --> 00:02:52.759
Thank you!
Did you enjoy your meal?

44
00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:53.993
Yes, I did.

45
00:02:53.993 --> 00:02:55.962
Oh, my wife loves this dish, too.

46
00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:58.798
Then make a delivery order
to your home, too!

47
00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:01.601
<i>Our entire menu is there if you
open the "Strongest Deliveryman" app.</i>

48
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.635
<i>- Oh, really?
- Yes.</i>

49
00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:04.537
<i>- I'll do that, then!
- All right!</i>

50
00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.075
With figures like these,
we really have succeeded.

51
00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:10.977
You're the best, CEO Choi.

52
00:03:12.846 --> 00:03:14.614
- What?
- You said that we were successful.

53
00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:18.051
But we haven't actually succeeded yet!

54
00:03:18.051 --> 00:03:20.153
You just said that we're
pretty successful now, though!

55
00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:22.822
Hey, the computer is acting weird!

56
00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:26.159
Hey!

57
00:03:32.098 --> 00:03:33.967
What's got you two so busy?

58
00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:36.436
I had to eat lunch alone
with this guy again!

59
00:03:36.436 --> 00:03:38.071
Oh, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:38.638 --> 00:03:39.739
Hurry up and give me your orders.

61
00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.074
What do you guys want to eat?

62
00:03:41.074 --> 00:03:43.009
Um... jjajangmyun.

63
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.811
- Two jjajangmyuns!
- Two jjajangmyuns, got it!

64
00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:46.546
Two more jjajangmyun, please!

65
00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:57.357
Say, "ah!"

66
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.161
Stop it--

67
00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:03.997
So cute.

68
00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:08.001
How far have you gone with
Mister, Ms. Dan Ah?

69
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.605
- Huh?
- Did you two kiss?

70
00:04:17.143 --> 00:04:18.645
Oh, you did, didn't you!

71
00:04:19.212 --> 00:04:20.747
Who kissed who first?

72
00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:23.149
Ji Yoon!

73
00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:24.918
I bet that's how it was.

74
00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:26.920
Mister is really stone-faced
when he wants to be.

75
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.189
I went at him once, too,
and was utterly humiliated.

76
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.392
How many times did it take
for you to succeed?

77
00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:33.927
Shut your mouth and eat your noodles.

78
00:04:33.927 --> 00:04:35.328
Come on, Ms. Dan Ah!

79
00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:36.963
It's not like we're animals!

80
00:04:36.963 --> 00:04:40.266
Only human beings have the ability
to talk while they're eating.

81
00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:41.935
What did you two do after you kissed?

82
00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.237
Hey.

83
00:04:45.638 --> 00:04:48.741
Why? I want to know, as reference.

84
00:04:48.741 --> 00:04:50.977
I... I... I... I'm done eating.

85
00:04:52.078 --> 00:04:53.680
Um, me too.
I'm.. I'm done.

86
00:04:57.216 --> 00:04:58.785
Tell me, Ms. Dan Ah.

87
00:04:58.785 --> 00:05:00.620
It's only us two now.

88
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.988
What'd you do after that?

89
00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:09.128
Yeah, I want to know, too.

90
00:05:12.465 --> 00:05:13.933
Thank you for the meal.

91
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:17.437
Why are you all leaving?

92
00:05:17.437 --> 00:05:19.672
Sex is nothing to be embarrassed about!

93
00:05:22.742 --> 00:05:24.611
Who am I supposed to ask about this?

94
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:27.046
We have many other businessmen
coming back to Restaurant Row now.

95
00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:29.282
And not just the employees
from Sunjin Construction, either.

96
00:05:29.282 --> 00:05:30.750
We have a lot of delivery
orders going out, too.

97
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.219
If we keep this up, we'll be able
to make more money than we'd projected

98
00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.155
and even Strongest Deliveryman may be
able to make profits for the first time!

99
00:05:36.155 --> 00:05:37.924
Ooh!

100
00:05:37.924 --> 00:05:39.325
Let's hang in there for a bit longer.

101
00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:40.360
If we get Jung Family out of here

102
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.129
I might be able to give you all a
bonus on top of your paychecks.

103
00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.366
- Aw, yes!
- Yes!

104
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.035
All right, a round of applause for our
new employee, Oh Jin Kyu

105
00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:50.236
who gave us a great idea!

106
00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:55.541
Oh, stop it!
You're embarrassing me!

107
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:57.276
- Good boy.
- Jeez.

108
00:05:57.276 --> 00:05:58.711
Why does he keep acting like that?

109
00:06:00.813 --> 00:06:03.082
Our sales have dropped by 50 percent.

110
00:06:03.082 --> 00:06:08.454
At this rate, the Jung Family Complex
may have a 300 million won deficit.

111
00:06:11.424 --> 00:06:13.359
How much interest do we owe the banks
this month for our loans?

112
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.829
Including the 10 billion we
borrowed from Youngil Bank, I mean.

113
00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:18.564
120 million won per month.

114
00:06:18.564 --> 00:06:21.200
And after 6 months, we'll have to start
paying off the loan while paying interest

115
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.869
so we'll need around
three times that amount.

116
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.772
Let's start offering delivery, too.

117
00:06:25.772 --> 00:06:28.574
Set up an app and a
delivery system in 15 days.

118
00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:29.976
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:06:29.976 --> 00:06:32.045
- And what about the other bait?
- It's ready, ma'am.

120
00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:34.180
Release it when we start
offering delivery.

121
00:06:34.714 --> 00:06:36.382
We have to wipe them out
in one fell swoop.

122
00:06:36.382 --> 00:06:37.717
Understood.

123
00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:48.594
What are you looking at so intently?

124
00:06:48.594 --> 00:06:50.463
Huh?
Um, it's nothing.

125
00:06:50.463 --> 00:06:52.765
- What is it?
- I told you, it's nothing.

126
00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:54.500
Why are you hiding it
if it's nothing? Let me see.

127
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.369
I told you, it's nothing!
Why are you being like this?

128
00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:57.704
This just makes things
seem more suspicious.

129
00:07:03.476 --> 00:07:05.478
I'll kiss you if you don't show me.

130
00:07:05.478 --> 00:07:07.947
Oh, jeez.
Here, look, look.

131
00:07:09.182 --> 00:07:11.350
Huh? The words on the screen changed.

132
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.186
If you're done with it, give it back.

133
00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:15.321
What do those English words mean?

134
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:16.923
None of your business.

135
00:07:16.923 --> 00:07:18.191
Why does it say plus 20?

136
00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:20.059
I said it's none of your business!

137
00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:21.594
Oh.

138
00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:24.597
You've been counting the days
since... that day, huh?

139
00:07:24.597 --> 00:07:26.299
You're so quick on the uptake.

140
00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:28.735
So make sure you do everything properly.

141
00:07:28.735 --> 00:07:32.839
If not, "Happy Day" might
change back to "D-Day" again.

142
00:07:34.107 --> 00:07:38.010
And if that happens,
we'll really have no hope.

143
00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:44.383
To some people, it may seem like
I just changed some words around.

144
00:07:45.284 --> 00:07:46.886
But not to me.

145
00:07:47.854 --> 00:07:51.958
That was the day that I felt
hope for the first time.

146
00:07:52.525 --> 00:07:56.129
And the first day that I'd ever
entertained the idea of being happy.

147
00:07:58.598 --> 00:07:59.999
Because of you.

148
00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:04.070
Make sure you keep your promise.

149
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.339
Make me happy, no matter what.

150
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:09.776
Understand?

151
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.278
Yeah.

152
00:08:16.182 --> 00:08:20.920
Thanks for being by my side.

153
00:08:22.722 --> 00:08:24.924
And for making me happy, too.

154
00:09:16.442 --> 00:09:19.679
Why do you keep staring at me?
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

155
00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:21.147
Because you're good-looking.

156
00:09:21.147 --> 00:09:23.182
- What?
- I said, you're good-looking.

157
00:09:24.817 --> 00:09:27.286
It's true. You seem more charismatic
the more I look at you.

158
00:09:27.286 --> 00:09:28.421
How do I put this?

159
00:09:28.421 --> 00:09:31.691
At first, I thought you were
nothing but a useless diamond

160
00:09:31.691 --> 00:09:34.660
but now, you seem like you've
become a very useful pebble.

161
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.864
Was that actually supposed to
be a compliment?

162
00:09:37.864 --> 00:09:40.032
- Of course.
- Hey, come on.

163
00:09:40.032 --> 00:09:42.168
You sure have a way of making even
your compliments sound like insults.

164
00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:43.769
You love it, though.

165
00:09:44.503 --> 00:09:46.072
Sweet dreams, Pebble!

166
00:10:03.422 --> 00:10:06.959
Ugh, please, stop it. I feel like
I'm going to have a nightmare.

167
00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:08.427
Stop it.

168
00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:09.795
Wait a second.

169
00:10:19.405 --> 00:10:22.642
Oh, thank the heavens!
Thank you so much!

170
00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:51.604
Thanks for making me into
a useful pebble.

171
00:10:57.476 --> 00:10:59.445
I'm more thankful.

172
00:11:02.615 --> 00:11:04.817
If you hadn't been there, Mr. Jin Kyu

173
00:11:04.817 --> 00:11:07.019
I would've been crying
by myself every day.

174
00:11:08.187 --> 00:11:09.455
Mr. Jin Kyu.

175
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:11.190
Hmm?

176
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.192
Is it okay for me to love you?

177
00:11:17.396 --> 00:11:19.532
Do you want to love me too, Mr. Jin Kyu?

178
00:11:25.104 --> 00:11:26.439
All right, then.

179
00:11:28.574 --> 00:11:30.676
- Close your eyes.
- Fine.

180
00:11:31.544 --> 00:11:33.479
Good night.

181
00:12:03.576 --> 00:12:04.844
Wait!

182
00:12:04.844 --> 00:12:07.546
I think I forgot to brush my teeth.

183
00:12:07.546 --> 00:12:08.748
Hey, what--

184
00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:10.649
Wait just a moment!
I'll be right back.

185
00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:13.052
What are you -- you're not supposed
to do that in the middle of a kiss!

186
00:12:13.052 --> 00:12:14.420
<i>I'm sorry! It'll only take a second.</i>

187
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.156
<i>- Be ready to make out when I come back!
- Ugh, forget it!</i>

188
00:12:17.156 --> 00:12:19.025
<i>- I'm going to bed!
- It'll only take a second!</i>

189
00:12:19.025 --> 00:12:20.426
<i>Just a moment!</i>

190
00:12:51.557 --> 00:12:53.359
This is the delivery course.
150-100.

191
00:12:53.359 --> 00:12:56.328
218 in 2-Gudong, and 38 in Gildong.

192
00:12:56.328 --> 00:12:58.164
Then 158 in Chonyukdong-dong.

193
00:12:58.164 --> 00:12:59.698
Doonchon 2-dong, 126.

194
00:12:59.698 --> 00:13:02.168
And then there's 152 in 2-dong.

195
00:13:04.103 --> 00:13:06.105
I'm back!

196
00:13:20.619 --> 00:13:22.621
- CEO Choi!
- Oh my gosh, you surprised me!

197
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:24.190
- CEO Choi!
- Why, this dog--

198
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.025
What do you want?

199
00:13:26.025 --> 00:13:29.128
Dog? Yes, indeed!
How'd you know?

200
00:13:29.128 --> 00:13:30.396
Whoa, a knife!
Whoa.

201
00:13:30.396 --> 00:13:32.398
- Section Chief Na!
- Oh, CEO Choi!

202
00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:36.302
Come outside! I've prepared
an event to help you out.

203
00:13:36.302 --> 00:13:38.170
Welcome, welcome!

204
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.438
Hello!

205
00:13:39.438 --> 00:13:43.008
You can take a photo with a
"Strongest Deliveryman" deliveryman

206
00:13:43.008 --> 00:13:44.877
and a cute dog!

207
00:13:44.877 --> 00:13:46.445
<i>Come into the corner!</i>

208
00:13:46.445 --> 00:13:47.713
One, two!

209
00:14:00.593 --> 00:14:03.329
<i>The president of Youngil Bank,
that rotten bastard.</i>

210
00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:06.832
<i>President Kim Jong Hyun of
Youngil Bank is a total son of a bitch.</i>

211
00:14:08.267 --> 00:14:09.535
Welcome--

212
00:14:11.237 --> 00:14:13.305
Mister!

213
00:14:17.643 --> 00:14:18.878
Mister!

214
00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:22.248
Yeah, hey, Kang Soo.
Long time no see.

215
00:14:23.349 --> 00:14:24.817
And you too, Soon Ae.

216
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:35.861
I was talking with Kang Soo when he
was at the detention center

217
00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:37.163
and your name came up, Soon Ae.

218
00:14:37.163 --> 00:14:39.498
So I came, just in case.

219
00:14:39.498 --> 00:14:41.567
But it really was you.

220
00:14:42.401 --> 00:14:44.103
Yes.

221
00:14:44.703 --> 00:14:46.539
Have you been doing well?

222
00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:48.073
Well, more or less.

223
00:14:48.073 --> 00:14:49.842
Why did you end up in
the detention center?

224
00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.512
When you deal with
money often...

225
00:14:54.113 --> 00:14:55.714
misunderstandings happen.

226
00:14:55.714 --> 00:14:57.783
But it's all been resolved now.

227
00:14:59.952 --> 00:15:01.520
Soon Ae.

228
00:15:02.388 --> 00:15:03.622
You...

229
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.992
can't be treating me like this.

230
00:15:06.992 --> 00:15:10.963
Your father and I were like brothers.

231
00:15:10.963 --> 00:15:12.531
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:13.332 --> 00:15:15.868
That was why it was that much
more hard for me to tell you.

233
00:15:16.468 --> 00:15:19.805
You're quite scary once you
spring into action, after all.

234
00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:25.377
It would've all been resolved if
I just disappeared quietly.

235
00:15:26.779 --> 00:15:28.013
All right.

236
00:15:28.714 --> 00:15:30.749
Let's keep in touch from now on.

237
00:15:32.184 --> 00:15:33.819
Please eat here before you leave, sir.

238
00:15:33.819 --> 00:15:35.487
Next time.

239
00:15:38.724 --> 00:15:40.259
Are you Lee Dan Ah, Young Miss?

240
00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:41.627
Yes.

241
00:15:41.627 --> 00:15:43.028
You're pretty.

242
00:15:43.028 --> 00:15:45.864
So this is why Kang Soo thought
about you every night.

243
00:15:47.499 --> 00:15:49.034
All right, see you next time.

244
00:15:50.035 --> 00:15:52.438
- Goodbye, sir!
- Take care!

245
00:15:52.438 --> 00:15:53.472
Goodbye, sir!

246
00:16:04.149 --> 00:16:07.152
Wow, you sure disclosed a lot to
someone you met in the detention center.

247
00:16:07.152 --> 00:16:10.823
Sorry. We talked about a lot of things
every night, and the topic came up.

248
00:16:10.823 --> 00:16:12.591
Jeez, you gossiper!

249
00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:15.394
But, what's the relationship between
the boss and Ms. Soon Ae?

250
00:16:15.394 --> 00:16:16.829
How did they meet?

251
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:17.930
None of your business.

252
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.365
Hey!

253
00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:25.304
Ms. Soon Ae used to be famous as
the daughter of a really rich man.

254
00:16:25.304 --> 00:16:29.975
And the boss was a gang member who'd
received orders to kidnap her.

255
00:17:25.664 --> 00:17:26.965
She's not here, either?

256
00:17:26.965 --> 00:17:28.500
Go look in the basement.

257
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.568
Yes, sir.

258
00:17:29.568 --> 00:17:31.103
Hey, go to the basement!

259
00:17:32.438 --> 00:17:35.407
And so, the two of them started
meeting up secretly.

260
00:17:35.407 --> 00:17:39.111
And Ms. Soon Ae even asked him
to run away with her.

261
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:43.015
But I think the boss lost his chance
while he was hesitating.

262
00:17:43.015 --> 00:17:46.785
Oh, so that's why she's always
so hard on him?

263
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.955
Jeez, you've turned me into
a gossiper too, now!

264
00:17:49.955 --> 00:17:51.490
Pretend that you don't
know about this story!

265
00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.991
If Ms. Soon Ae finds out,
I'll get in trouble.

266
00:17:52.991 --> 00:17:54.159
All right.

267
00:17:56.729 --> 00:17:58.097
Kang Soo.

268
00:17:58.097 --> 00:17:59.231
Yeah?

269
00:17:59.231 --> 00:18:00.833
Let's make a promise.

270
00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:05.204
No matter what happens, let's not
break up in a stupid way.

271
00:18:06.071 --> 00:18:09.608
And that, no matter how difficult
something may be, we'll do it together.

272
00:18:11.243 --> 00:18:12.411
Promise me.

273
00:18:13.612 --> 00:18:15.347
All right, I promise.

274
00:18:15.347 --> 00:18:16.615
Stamp.

275
00:18:16.915 --> 00:18:18.350
Sign!

276
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.018
Scan!

277
00:18:20.452 --> 00:18:22.087
Laminate!

278
00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:27.593
Seal.

279
00:18:36.702 --> 00:18:37.803
Oh, jeez.

280
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.105
The preparations are complete.

281
00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.176
Begin.

282
00:19:17.176 --> 00:19:18.544
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

283
00:19:26.318 --> 00:19:29.321
Wow, we're saved
thanks to Kang Soo!

284
00:19:31.356 --> 00:19:33.892
Oh, I'm so tired!

285
00:19:33.892 --> 00:19:36.829
I'll lock up the restaurant so
you should go home, Boss.

286
00:19:36.829 --> 00:19:37.996
Oh, really?

287
00:19:37.996 --> 00:19:41.033
Oh, I'm sorry for always
imposing on you.

288
00:19:41.033 --> 00:19:42.167
It's okay!

289
00:19:42.167 --> 00:19:45.270
But in exchange, give me a
raise if the restaurant does well!

290
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.639
Money has been a bit tight lately.

291
00:19:47.639 --> 00:19:49.007
All right, all right!

292
00:19:49.007 --> 00:19:51.410
I'll give you a huge raise
if we just get past this hurdle.

293
00:19:52.177 --> 00:19:53.745
I'll leave it to you, then!

294
00:19:53.745 --> 00:19:55.347
All right, see you tomorrow.

295
00:19:55.347 --> 00:19:56.482
Okay!

296
00:19:57.449 --> 00:19:59.885
- Goodbye!
- All right, bye!

297
00:20:03.989 --> 00:20:05.224
Excuse me!

298
00:20:05.224 --> 00:20:06.992
Oh, we're closed for the day.

299
00:20:06.992 --> 00:20:09.895
I'm not here to eat.
I wanted to talk to you.

300
00:20:10.462 --> 00:20:11.930
What, exactly?

301
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.433
I'm not the owner here.
I'm just an employee.

302
00:20:14.433 --> 00:20:16.935
Yes, I know. And that's why
I've come to see you.

303
00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:21.707
There it comes!

304
00:20:24.977 --> 00:20:26.979
- Hello, everyone!
- yes, hello!

305
00:20:26.979 --> 00:20:28.413
You brought the newly-
harvested rice, right?

306
00:20:28.413 --> 00:20:30.916
Oh, of course!
It's gleaming!

307
00:20:30.916 --> 00:20:32.951
Hey, bring me a bag
of the newly-harvested rice.

308
00:20:32.951 --> 00:20:34.052
Sure.

309
00:20:34.052 --> 00:20:35.320
Oof.
Here, ma'am.

310
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.655
Yes, in there, please.

311
00:20:46.565 --> 00:20:48.634
- Excuse me.
- Who are you?

312
00:20:48.634 --> 00:20:50.836
I'd like to meet with you
after you're done with work.

313
00:20:50.836 --> 00:20:52.070
Why would I meet with you?

314
00:20:54.406 --> 00:20:55.607
You'll see when you come by.

315
00:20:56.708 --> 00:20:57.876
Be sure to come...

316
00:20:57.876 --> 00:21:00.879
if you don't want to cause
any harm to Mr. Choi Kang Soo.

317
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.016
<i>[Jung Family Foods
Chief Park Sang Do]</i>

318
00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:08.487
What?

319
00:21:08.487 --> 00:21:12.758
I said, I can send you
back to jail if I wanted to.

320
00:21:14.426 --> 00:21:16.895
Sorry, lady, but that incident
is all over now.

321
00:21:16.895 --> 00:21:19.531
No, it's not.

322
00:21:19.531 --> 00:21:20.666
Special violence isn't a crime that
can't be persecuted for

323
00:21:20.666 --> 00:21:21.934
without a victim's complaint.

324
00:21:21.934 --> 00:21:23.468
Even if the victim says
that it's all okay

325
00:21:23.468 --> 00:21:26.939
they have to re-open the investigation if
a third party reports it to the police.

326
00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:29.041
And judging from what
I saw on the CCTV footage

327
00:21:29.041 --> 00:21:31.510
you even came into
Jung Family Seolleongtang

328
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.880
threatened Oh Jin Kyu, and
damaged our property.

329
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.882
You'll have to pay for
those crimes, too.

330
00:21:38.617 --> 00:21:39.885
Report me then, woman.

331
00:21:39.885 --> 00:21:41.453
I'll just rot away in there
for a couple of years.

332
00:21:41.453 --> 00:21:43.155
What kind of crap is this?

333
00:21:43.155 --> 00:21:45.490
I didn't call you over here
to blackmail you.

334
00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:47.926
What did you say?

335
00:21:47.926 --> 00:21:51.730
I'm going to use this to blackmail
Choi Kang Soo instead of you.

336
00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:55.500
You and Choi Kang Soo
are quite close.

337
00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.172
So he'll definitely falter if
I threaten to send you to jail.

338
00:22:00.172 --> 00:22:03.809
Or he'll do whatever it takes to put
the blame on himself again.

339
00:22:03.809 --> 00:22:07.913
At any rate, he'll be so miserable
that he'll go crazy.

340
00:22:09.147 --> 00:22:10.415
Choose.

341
00:22:10.415 --> 00:22:14.152
Do you want to become a traitor,
and be miserable?

342
00:22:14.152 --> 00:22:15.454
Or...

343
00:22:15.988 --> 00:22:18.423
do you want to make Choi Kang Soo
miserable because of you?

344
00:22:19.191 --> 00:22:20.626
Why, you little--

345
00:22:22.894 --> 00:22:25.030
Bring over all the guys
who work under you

346
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.598
and come to Jung Family.

347
00:22:27.065 --> 00:22:28.600
We're starting a delivery service, too.

348
00:22:35.707 --> 00:22:37.109
Oh, you're here?

349
00:22:37.109 --> 00:22:38.644
Wow, you came at the perfect time!

350
00:22:38.644 --> 00:22:39.678
Hurry over here!

351
00:22:52.591 --> 00:22:53.659
What brings you here?

352
00:22:53.659 --> 00:22:55.060
What else? To eat ramen, of course.

353
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.329
But, where did you go off to
by yourself?

354
00:22:57.329 --> 00:22:58.997
Just to get some fresh air.

355
00:22:58.997 --> 00:23:01.700
You get plenty of fresh air making
deliveries, and yet you went out again?

356
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.435
Were you off letting loose?

357
00:23:03.435 --> 00:23:04.603
Crazy bastard.

358
00:23:04.603 --> 00:23:06.638
Yes, CEO Choi.
That joke fell flat.

359
00:23:06.638 --> 00:23:07.973
I'll pretend that I didn't hear that.

360
00:23:07.973 --> 00:23:10.308
Yes, your sense of humor is
not exactly palatable.

361
00:23:10.809 --> 00:23:13.879
Oh... oh wow, that was a bad joke, huh?
Let's eat up, everyone.

362
00:23:14.746 --> 00:23:16.648
Oh, there aren't any
chopsticks for you!

363
00:23:16.648 --> 00:23:20.018
Here. I didn't put my mouth on this. I
only used it to portion the noodles out.

364
00:23:25.991 --> 00:23:27.926
This is what's wrong with you.

365
00:23:27.926 --> 00:23:29.928
- What do you mean?
- Take care of feeding yourself first!

366
00:23:29.928 --> 00:23:31.563
Instead of thinking about
feeding others first!

367
00:23:31.563 --> 00:23:32.998
You're not just some
other person to me, though.

368
00:23:32.998 --> 00:23:34.066
What am I, then?

369
00:23:34.066 --> 00:23:35.367
My Lord.

370
00:23:36.168 --> 00:23:37.202
My Lord.

371
00:23:37.202 --> 00:23:40.272
Please eat up, my lord!
This food is truly nutritious!

372
00:23:41.807 --> 00:23:44.109
What's with you, Kang Soo?

373
00:23:44.109 --> 00:23:46.778
I guess CEO Choi is in a good mood
since business is booming.

374
00:23:53.418 --> 00:23:55.687
We have to work even harder at times
like this, when things are going well.

375
00:23:55.687 --> 00:23:56.988
Running a business is all
about credibility.

376
00:23:56.988 --> 00:23:58.457
We always have to be consistent.
Got it, everyone?

377
00:23:58.457 --> 00:23:59.658
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

378
00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:03.161
But, where did Sung Jae go?

379
00:24:03.161 --> 00:24:04.863
He was gone when
we woke up this morning.

380
00:24:10.001 --> 00:24:11.136
Yes?

381
00:24:11.136 --> 00:24:13.038
<i>Big trouble, Kang Soo!</i>

382
00:24:13.038 --> 00:24:15.707
<i>Jung Family Foods started
offering delivery, too!</i>

383
00:24:15.707 --> 00:24:16.742
What?

384
00:24:21.079 --> 00:24:22.247
Oh, you're here!

385
00:24:22.247 --> 00:24:23.749
Look!

386
00:24:23.749 --> 00:24:26.885
They were handing these out when I was
heading to work this morning!

387
00:24:26.885 --> 00:24:28.320
What do we do now?

388
00:24:29.554 --> 00:24:32.257
Huh?
What's that?

389
00:24:34.693 --> 00:24:35.727
Sung Jae!

390
00:25:07.292 --> 00:25:08.693
What are you doing right now?

391
00:25:09.427 --> 00:25:11.463
They said they'd pay me a lot,
so I switched over.

392
00:25:11.463 --> 00:25:13.465
I want to make some big bucks, too.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

393
00:25:13.465 --> 00:25:16.234
- What?
- Hey, have you no conscience?

394
00:25:16.234 --> 00:25:18.737
Kang Soo even went to the detention
center because of you!

395
00:25:18.737 --> 00:25:20.071
That's why I switched over.

396
00:25:20.071 --> 00:25:22.874
A CEO like him who is so nosy
won't be able to make any money.

397
00:25:22.874 --> 00:25:24.476
Anyway, that's why I switched over.

398
00:25:24.476 --> 00:25:26.611
So don't be too sad about it.

399
00:25:26.611 --> 00:25:29.281
- Kim Sung Jae!
- You guys are doing great now, anyway.

400
00:25:29.281 --> 00:25:31.750
It won't be a problem even if a couple
guys like me drop out, right?

401
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:32.784
Hey!

402
00:25:35.487 --> 00:25:36.755
I was an orphan.

403
00:25:36.755 --> 00:25:39.224
Guys like me can only become
psychos when they have no money.

404
00:25:39.224 --> 00:25:40.659
So try to be understanding, yeah?

405
00:25:44.696 --> 00:25:45.697
Sorry.

406
00:25:45.697 --> 00:25:47.732
I'll be going now.

407
00:26:03.515 --> 00:26:07.319
How could Sung Jae,
of all people, do that to us?

408
00:26:07.319 --> 00:26:09.788
Wow, money really does
buy everything, huh?

409
00:26:09.788 --> 00:26:11.189
It wasn't because of the money.

410
00:26:12.257 --> 00:26:15.727
Sung Jae definitely isn't someone
to be won over by money.

411
00:26:15.727 --> 00:26:18.430
It's definitely something else
besides money.

412
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.598
Jeez, Kang Soo.

413
00:26:19.598 --> 00:26:21.666
There's no surer reason
than money out there!

414
00:26:21.666 --> 00:26:23.768
No, I'm sure of it.

415
00:26:23.768 --> 00:26:25.503
You'll really need to get
your head on straight.

416
00:26:25.503 --> 00:26:28.506
I think that they did this
with you as their main target.

417
00:26:29.207 --> 00:26:31.309
They could've gotten deliverymen
from other places.

418
00:26:31.309 --> 00:26:33.345
But they stole away your friend
from your hometown, of all people.

419
00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:35.347
They definitely did this in order
to make you waver.

420
00:26:36.915 --> 00:26:38.483
Does Jung Family
really stoop that low?

421
00:26:38.483 --> 00:26:40.752
They're capable of worse things,
in my opinion.

422
00:26:43.488 --> 00:26:44.856
Let's get to work for now.

423
00:26:44.856 --> 00:26:48.059
Jung Family is delivering too.
Now, it's a real war.

424
00:26:48.059 --> 00:26:50.228
Everyone, get to your battle positions!

425
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:52.864
- Battle positions.
- Battle positions.

426
00:27:01.006 --> 00:27:02.107
Kang Soo...

427
00:27:04.009 --> 00:27:05.210
It's okay.

428
00:27:06.411 --> 00:27:07.812
He'll be back.

429
00:27:09.281 --> 00:27:11.082
He always comes back if I wait.

430
00:27:16.755 --> 00:27:19.557
So, Team Manager Kim. How is the work?

431
00:27:21.326 --> 00:27:22.994
Let me know if you need anything.

432
00:27:22.994 --> 00:27:24.796
Kang Soo won't be ruined
because you do this.

433
00:27:24.796 --> 00:27:26.665
You'll end up a fool in the end.

434
00:27:26.665 --> 00:27:27.732
Have some manners.

435
00:27:27.732 --> 00:27:28.934
Leave him be.

436
00:27:28.934 --> 00:27:31.069
If thinking that makes you feel better,
go ahead.

437
00:27:31.069 --> 00:27:32.537
You can get going, Team Manager Kim.

438
00:27:40.378 --> 00:27:43.081
How is the bait that's being
put out in the restaurants going?

439
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:45.450
<i>The food products will be
handed over today.</i>

440
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.041
Sorry. Excuse me.

441
00:28:12.911 --> 00:28:16.881
You've mixed in imports with the
domestic so it's very hard to tell.

442
00:28:16.881 --> 00:28:18.316
Still, experts know the difference.

443
00:28:18.316 --> 00:28:21.820
The seafood and red chili powder
all have Chinese products mixed in.

444
00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.189
You are in violation
of certification of origin.

445
00:28:24.189 --> 00:28:26.758
No, that can't be.

446
00:28:26.758 --> 00:28:29.027
It really is domestic.

447
00:28:29.027 --> 00:28:30.895
It really is!

448
00:28:30.895 --> 00:28:32.697
Kang Soo, what's going on?

449
00:28:32.697 --> 00:28:34.833
I don't know. I don't know either.

450
00:28:34.833 --> 00:28:38.103
What the heck!
I thought it was 100 percent domestic.

451
00:28:38.103 --> 00:28:39.270
I refuse to pay.

452
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.139
Oh, wait!

453
00:28:42.507 --> 00:28:43.842
What's going on?

454
00:28:46.511 --> 00:28:49.314
Min Chan, go to your hometown and
find out what happened.

455
00:28:49.314 --> 00:28:50.515
Yeah, okay.

456
00:28:50.515 --> 00:28:51.783
I'll go with you.

457
00:28:51.783 --> 00:28:53.818
We'll visit the other restaurants.

458
00:28:59.357 --> 00:29:02.027
Why did the inspectors suddenly come?

459
00:29:02.627 --> 00:29:04.729
Why only that restaurant of all places?

460
00:29:04.729 --> 00:29:06.197
Apparently, someone called in a tip.

461
00:29:07.232 --> 00:29:08.400
A tip?

462
00:29:10.268 --> 00:29:11.870
What are you going to do now?

463
00:29:12.537 --> 00:29:14.672
We could lose Sunjin Construction.

464
00:29:21.513 --> 00:29:22.714
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:22.714 --> 00:29:26.284
Please give us time to find out
what happened.

466
00:29:26.284 --> 00:29:28.319
Convincing me alone won't do it.

467
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.423
The employees are calling for me
to break this contract.

468
00:29:31.423 --> 00:29:33.892
Their pride is very hurt.

469
00:29:41.733 --> 00:29:43.368
What good is an apology?

470
00:29:43.368 --> 00:29:45.003
How can they lie about the food source?

471
00:29:45.003 --> 00:29:46.704
That's all for show.

472
00:29:46.704 --> 00:29:48.273
They'll do the same thing again later.

473
00:29:48.273 --> 00:29:49.340
I know.

474
00:29:49.674 --> 00:29:52.143
People who lie about food disgust me.

475
00:29:52.143 --> 00:29:54.345
Don't let them off the hook.
Cancel the contract.

476
00:29:58.483 --> 00:30:00.752

We sincerely apologize.]</i>

477
00:30:05.123 --> 00:30:07.759
<i>Because of the rumors about the
food origins...</i>

478
00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:09.260
customers aren't coming anymore.

479
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.897
If Sunjin Construction turns on us,
we'll be ruined.

480
00:30:12.897 --> 00:30:16.201
All because of you,
we're all going to be ruined.

481
00:30:16.201 --> 00:30:17.569
What are you going to do?

482
00:30:17.569 --> 00:30:19.137
Why are you blaming me?

483
00:30:19.137 --> 00:30:20.939
I really don't know a thing.

484
00:30:20.939 --> 00:30:24.309
You sold off the domestic goods and
bought imports to use.

485
00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:26.010
You're going to keep blaming an
innocent person?

486
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:31.316
All I did I was use what Kang Soo brought
and cook food with that.

487
00:30:31.316 --> 00:30:33.751
You really won't stop, will you?

488
00:30:33.985 --> 00:30:36.488
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

489
00:30:39.124 --> 00:30:40.158
Wait.

490
00:30:41.626 --> 00:30:43.595
Do you think Kang Soo fooled us?

491
00:30:43.595 --> 00:30:45.997
- What?
- Think about it.

492
00:30:45.997 --> 00:30:48.867
I really only used what Kang Soo
brought me.

493
00:30:48.867 --> 00:30:51.102
That means he could've fooled me.

494
00:30:51.369 --> 00:30:52.704
Isn't that true?

495
00:31:11.422 --> 00:31:14.859
Kang Soo... they've all gone home.

496
00:31:15.793 --> 00:31:16.928
Let's go.

497
00:31:18.563 --> 00:31:19.697
Get up.

498
00:31:32.911 --> 00:31:33.978
Kang Soo.

499
00:31:33.978 --> 00:31:38.449
President Park here
insists it really wasn't her.

500
00:31:38.449 --> 00:31:40.852
We've seen her morning and night for
20 years.

501
00:31:40.852 --> 00:31:42.487
I doubt that she'd lie.

502
00:31:42.487 --> 00:31:45.156
Tell us. Was it you?

503
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.892
You wouldn't lie to us, would you?

504
00:31:47.892 --> 00:31:49.294
What do you think you're doing?

505
00:31:49.294 --> 00:31:51.129
We're just so frustrated is all.

506
00:31:51.129 --> 00:31:52.764
What are you so frustrated about?

507
00:31:52.764 --> 00:31:54.999
Even if you are,
are you as frustrated as him?

508
00:31:54.999 --> 00:31:56.868
Why are you getting angry at us?

509
00:31:56.868 --> 00:31:59.037
- Are you feeling guilty about something?
- What?

510
00:31:59.037 --> 00:32:00.338
Why would you react this way?

511
00:32:00.338 --> 00:32:02.774
Oh, it must be true.

512
00:32:02.774 --> 00:32:04.142
You did lie to us.

513
00:32:04.142 --> 00:32:06.911
You lied and said they were domestic
and made some money off us.

514
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:09.180
You made money off of us through
the deliveries too.

515
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.083
You acted like you cared about us
on the outside.

516
00:32:12.083 --> 00:32:13.952
Behind our backs, you were using us.

517
00:32:13.952 --> 00:32:15.587
Are you finished?

518
00:32:19.824 --> 00:32:22.760
Where are you going?
Aren't you going to answer us?

519
00:32:23.895 --> 00:32:25.063
Why you...

520
00:32:25.063 --> 00:32:27.298
I'm warning you.
Don't you dare touch him.

521
00:32:27.298 --> 00:32:29.801
If you lay one finger on him,
I won't let you be.

522
00:32:30.368 --> 00:32:34.572
Yesterday, it was you people giving
him a thumbs up when you saw Kang Soo.

523
00:32:34.572 --> 00:32:36.341
You completely change in one night?

524
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:39.377
He's your hero when you make money
and a bad person when you lose money?

525
00:32:39.377 --> 00:32:41.512
- Look at the way you're talking to me.
- Why?

526
00:32:41.512 --> 00:32:43.481
Did I say anything wrong?

527
00:32:44.816 --> 00:32:46.951
You people are all trash.

528
00:32:46.951 --> 00:32:50.822
You throw away pride, trust, conscience,
and everything for some money.

529
00:32:50.822 --> 00:32:54.892
This country is becoming more like hell
because of people like you.

530
00:32:58.796 --> 00:32:59.964
That's enough.

531
00:33:01.399 --> 00:33:02.667
Let's go.

532
00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:49.180
Kang Soo.

533
00:33:52.183 --> 00:33:55.853
Kang Soo, we got a fax from
Sunjin Construction.

534
00:33:57.188 --> 00:34:00.558
They want to cancel their contract
with us.

535
00:35:00.551 --> 00:35:01.986
Kang Soo.

536
00:35:03.187 --> 00:35:04.322
<i>Go.</i>

537
00:35:05.556 --> 00:35:06.758
Kang Soo.

538
00:35:07.759 --> 00:35:10.962
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

539
00:35:13.464 --> 00:35:14.732
<i>I'm all right.</i>

540
00:35:16.367 --> 00:35:17.602
Don't worry.

541
00:35:19.771 --> 00:35:20.938
See you tomorrow.

542
00:36:25.736 --> 00:36:26.804
You're here?

543
00:36:28.306 --> 00:36:29.307
Yes.

544
00:36:30.441 --> 00:36:32.143
You're up early.

545
00:36:32.143 --> 00:36:33.144
Yeah.

546
00:36:33.611 --> 00:36:35.947
- Did you sleep well?
- Of course.

547
00:36:49.727 --> 00:36:51.863
Did you two have breakfast?

548
00:36:52.196 --> 00:36:53.264
You haven't, right?

549
00:36:53.264 --> 00:36:55.600
Kang Soo, what do you want to eat?

550
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.102
Since it's breakfast,
do you want crispy rice stew?

551
00:36:58.836 --> 00:37:01.539
No, I'll just eat black bean noodles.

552
00:37:01.539 --> 00:37:03.307
Still, man...

553
00:37:03.574 --> 00:37:05.042
Then how about I make stir-fry
black bean noodles.

554
00:37:05.042 --> 00:37:08.079
No, just regular black bean noodles.

555
00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:10.114
All right, sure.

556
00:37:50.922 --> 00:37:53.591
Sunjin Construction contacted us asking
to meet tomorrow.

557
00:37:53.591 --> 00:37:56.127
They've canceled their contract
with Strongest Deliveryman.

558
00:37:56.127 --> 00:37:58.663
They want to sign with Jung Family,
who came in second.

559
00:37:58.696 --> 00:37:59.997
Good work.

560
00:38:00.865 --> 00:38:02.600
Proceed with the rest of our plans.

561
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:08.306
We need to use this opportunity to
destroy Strongest Deliveryman.

562
00:38:08.306 --> 00:38:12.376
That way, they cannot challenge us again.

563
00:38:12.777 --> 00:38:13.945
Yes, CEO Jung.

564
00:38:14.478 --> 00:38:16.514
Your parents seem to have a hard life.

565
00:38:16.514 --> 00:38:18.983
Shouldn't you be a good son to
them now?

566
00:38:19.483 --> 00:38:21.519
Are you doing background checks
on me too?

567
00:38:21.953 --> 00:38:24.055
If we want to scout you,
of course we need to.

568
00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.229
I heard that you were the most important
employee at Strongest Deliveryman.

569
00:38:32.229 --> 00:38:33.998
You have a great background, as well.

570
00:38:33.998 --> 00:38:38.569
It would be a waste of your talents
to stay at a company that's closing soon.

571
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.871
Come to Jung Family.

572
00:38:41.205 --> 00:38:44.208
We'll give you many opportunities to
develop your skills.

573
00:38:45.142 --> 00:38:48.079
Oh, how nice of you to show up
early in the morning.

574
00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:49.847
Thank you, customers.

575
00:38:49.847 --> 00:38:51.782
Good luck to you today.

576
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.853
See you again
on the fifteenth of next month.

577
00:38:56.787 --> 00:38:58.189
Hey, go see that guy.

578
00:38:58.556 --> 00:39:00.057
We have a customer to tend to.

579
00:39:03.995 --> 00:39:05.830
My gosh.

580
00:39:06.364 --> 00:39:08.165
The interest is so high.

581
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.535
How are we going to pay off that
interest next month?

582
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:15.172
All the restaurants are going under and
it seems like our company is too.

583
00:39:15.172 --> 00:39:18.275
Should we follow Sung Jae and
work there?

584
00:39:18.275 --> 00:39:20.911
- What?
- I'm just saying...

585
00:39:20.911 --> 00:39:22.780
We need to live first.

586
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.582
How can we betray Kang Soo though?

587
00:39:24.582 --> 00:39:27.118
This isn't the time for loyalty.

588
00:39:27.118 --> 00:39:30.388
We could lose all our organs,
at this rate.

589
00:39:30.388 --> 00:39:31.622
Our organs?

590
00:39:31.622 --> 00:39:35.926
Yes, people like that drag you away
if you can't pay the money.

591
00:39:35.926 --> 00:39:38.162
Then they take out your organs.

592
00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.204
Oh no.

593
00:39:56.547 --> 00:39:57.715
What do you want?

594
00:39:58.315 --> 00:39:59.650
Why are you here!

595
00:40:01.252 --> 00:40:03.120
Jung Family's delivery is honest
about its food origins.

596
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.289
Jung Family's delivery does not
fool its customers.

597
00:40:05.289 --> 00:40:07.224
Jung Family's delivery has integrity.

598
00:40:07.224 --> 00:40:09.960
Jung Family's delivery is honest about
it's food origins.

599
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.430
Jung Family's delivery does not
fool its customers.

600
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.765
Jung Family's delivery is honest
about its food origins.

601
00:40:14.765 --> 00:40:17.301
Jung Family's delivery does not
fool its customers.

602
00:40:17.301 --> 00:40:19.070
Jung Family's delivery has integrity.

603
00:40:20.071 --> 00:40:24.442
Then... will thing's become difficult
for Mister's company?

604
00:40:24.842 --> 00:40:26.477
I don't really know.

605
00:40:26.477 --> 00:40:29.246
This is all my mom's fault, right?

606
00:40:32.817 --> 00:40:34.185
Jin Kyu.

607
00:40:37.088 --> 00:40:38.289
Hmm?

608
00:40:39.557 --> 00:40:41.826
You're not going to hate me too, are you?

609
00:40:44.361 --> 00:40:46.497
Why would I hate you?

610
00:40:47.865 --> 00:40:49.834
I'm the daughter of Jung Family.

611
00:40:53.304 --> 00:40:54.605
You moved out.

612
00:40:55.639 --> 00:40:59.477
Now, you're an independent individual.

613
00:41:05.316 --> 00:41:06.517
Right?

614
00:41:10.621 --> 00:41:11.789
Your hand.

615
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.068
Young Taek and Byung Soo...

616
00:41:25.569 --> 00:41:26.771
they resigned.

617
00:41:27.304 --> 00:41:28.773
They want me to tell you sorry.

618
00:41:30.207 --> 00:41:31.742
They'll probably work for Jung Family.

619
00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:35.179
Orders are no longer coming in through
the Strongest Deliveryman app.

620
00:41:35.179 --> 00:41:38.816
I don't think we'll be able to get paid
for the food products we provided either.

621
00:41:39.683 --> 00:41:41.819
We need to pay this month's wages too.

622
00:41:42.386 --> 00:41:43.487
What should we do?

623
00:41:44.388 --> 00:41:47.324
How much money does the company have?

624
00:41:47.324 --> 00:41:52.029
The 100,000 won investment from the
delivery guys is 38.1 million won.

625
00:41:52.029 --> 00:41:54.865
No, don't touch that.

626
00:41:57.101 --> 00:41:58.435
Besides that...

627
00:41:58.903 --> 00:42:01.806
there's about 40 million won left
from the 100 million won investment.

628
00:42:02.039 --> 00:42:06.410
Then use that for the monthly wages.

629
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.980
Pay Sung Jae, Young Taek, and
Byung Soo too.

630
00:42:11.248 --> 00:42:12.516
Pay the insurance too.

631
00:42:12.516 --> 00:42:14.151
Then that investment money will be gone.

632
00:42:14.585 --> 00:42:15.886
There's nothing left.

633
00:42:20.157 --> 00:42:23.761
What next? What will you do after that?

634
00:42:34.672 --> 00:42:36.340
What were you talking about?

635
00:42:36.574 --> 00:42:38.809
- Just some stuff.
- About money?

636
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.412
I know the basics too.

637
00:42:41.412 --> 00:42:45.015
There's nothing left once this month's
pay goes out, right?

638
00:42:45.282 --> 00:42:46.383
Yes.

639
00:42:48.385 --> 00:42:50.754
- Then I'll invest my money.
- What?

640
00:42:50.754 --> 00:42:55.059
Keep it a secret from Kang Soo and
make up a story to hide it.

641
00:42:55.059 --> 00:42:57.428
Like say your hometown people helped
you or something.

642
00:42:57.428 --> 00:42:59.129
- Dan Ah...
- No!

643
00:43:00.798 --> 00:43:02.199
Not that money.

644
00:43:03.267 --> 00:43:04.501
Kang Soo.

645
00:43:05.269 --> 00:43:07.605
You should go, Min Chan.
Pretend you didn't hear that.

646
00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.976
Yeah, okay.

647
00:43:17.848 --> 00:43:19.450
What do you think you're doing?

648
00:43:19.717 --> 00:43:21.952
- You worked so hard to save that money.
- Why not?

649
00:43:22.887 --> 00:43:25.356
I'm making an investment too,
just like you.

650
00:43:26.757 --> 00:43:29.760
Accept it. Why can't you?

651
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.528
I'm making an investment in you.

652
00:43:31.528 --> 00:43:33.797
- Still, you can't.
- Then what will you do?

653
00:43:35.666 --> 00:43:36.901
Tell me.

654
00:43:37.401 --> 00:43:39.536
You're not giving up like this.

655
00:43:51.682 --> 00:43:52.750
Have this.

656
00:43:54.318 --> 00:43:55.586
Your throat hurts.

657
00:44:04.428 --> 00:44:05.629
I'll take the garbage.

658
00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:15.139
I might move to a different company.

659
00:44:15.139 --> 00:44:16.240
Where to?

660
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.408
A bigger company.

661
00:44:18.509 --> 00:44:19.910
The pay is better.

662
00:44:20.911 --> 00:44:22.279
It's much more stable.

663
00:44:22.279 --> 00:44:25.749
Then what about Strongest Deliveryman.
I heard things are tough right now.

664
00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:27.518
Can you leave at a time like this?

665
00:44:31.088 --> 00:44:32.656
Then don't go.

666
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:36.560
If you think you'll regret it,
it's best not to do it at all.

667
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.295
That's how it is for me right now.

668
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.766
I threw away my pride to make money.

669
00:44:42.766 --> 00:44:45.469
Because of that,
I'm miserable every night.

670
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:50.674
It feels like I threw out 300 million won
just to earn 3 million won.

671
00:45:01.051 --> 00:45:04.922
It's a lot colder now.
Make sure to turn the boiler on.

672
00:45:06.857 --> 00:45:07.992
I'm going to go now.

673
00:45:11.028 --> 00:45:12.329
I'll take you home.

674
00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:13.497
Are you going to run again?

675
00:45:13.797 --> 00:45:14.798
Yes.

676
00:45:29.446 --> 00:45:30.714
Kang Soo.

677
00:45:30.714 --> 00:45:31.749
Yeah?

678
00:45:35.052 --> 00:45:37.221
You're really okay, right?

679
00:45:37.888 --> 00:45:38.889
Yes.

680
00:45:41.358 --> 00:45:42.793
Are you really?

681
00:45:44.128 --> 00:45:45.229
Yes.

682
00:45:48.932 --> 00:45:50.234
That's good then.

683
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:07.351
I'll head inside.

684
00:46:08.552 --> 00:46:10.788
Okay. Good night.

685
00:46:11.588 --> 00:46:12.656
Okay.

686
00:46:14.358 --> 00:46:15.692
Dream of me.

687
00:46:16.126 --> 00:46:17.194
All right.

688
00:46:44.188 --> 00:46:45.589
You should get going.

689
00:47:20.591 --> 00:47:23.894
<i>Then what's going to happen to
Train Guy?</i>

690
00:47:25.062 --> 00:47:27.498
Is it going to end like this?

691
00:47:29.233 --> 00:47:32.169
Is it going to stop?

692
00:47:32.736 --> 00:47:34.004
No.

693
00:47:36.673 --> 00:47:38.142
He'll beat this.

694
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:42.212
He'll beat this and run again.

695
00:47:42.212 --> 00:47:43.347
How?

696
00:47:43.847 --> 00:47:45.649
Is there a way?

697
00:47:47.017 --> 00:47:48.152
I don't know.

698
00:47:50.387 --> 00:47:53.790
But, he will overcome this.

699
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:55.092
He is Kang Soo.

700
00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:58.729
He can do it.

701
00:47:58.729 --> 00:48:00.264
What if he can't manage to do it?

702
00:48:01.465 --> 00:48:03.033
Then what will you do?

703
00:48:05.002 --> 00:48:06.770
Are you going to leave?

704
00:48:08.071 --> 00:48:11.608
No... I won't leave.

705
00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:17.614
I made a promise to him not to leave.

706
00:50:07.157 --> 00:50:09.192
Is he really okay?

707
00:50:12.329 --> 00:50:13.830
Talk to me, would you?

708
00:50:16.733 --> 00:50:18.969
Is he really okay?

709
00:51:01.678 --> 00:51:02.813
<i>Dan Ah.</i>

710
00:51:04.014 --> 00:51:06.550
<i>I'm sorry. I have a favor to ask you.</i>

711
00:51:07.751 --> 00:51:08.919
<i>Don't look for me.</i>

712
00:51:09.519 --> 00:51:10.854
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

713
00:51:11.755 --> 00:51:13.990
- <i>You should leave too.</i>
- Kang Soo...

714
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:15.726
<i>Go to a place where there is hope.</i>

715
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.428
<i>Go there and be happy.</i>

716
00:51:19.229 --> 00:51:20.764
Kang Soo!

717
00:51:22.366 --> 00:51:23.700
Kang Soo!

720
00:51:28.038 --> 00:51:29.873
<i>want you to be happy.</i>

721
00:51:30.407 --> 00:51:31.508
Kang Soo!

722
00:51:31.508 --> 00:51:34.778
<i>I really want you to find happiness.</i>

723
00:51:35.846 --> 00:51:37.114
Kang Soo...

724
00:51:38.014 --> 00:51:39.149
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

725
00:51:40.717 --> 00:51:42.185
<i>I couldn't keep my promise to you.</i>

726
00:51:42.619 --> 00:51:44.020
Kang Soo.

727
00:51:44.488 --> 00:51:45.589
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

728
00:51:47.557 --> 00:51:49.326
Kang Soo.

729
00:51:50.827 --> 00:51:53.196
Kang Soo!
