00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.010
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420
Hold on. Where did it go?

3
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.330
Hey, it's you, Soo Jin.

4
00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.729
Hey.

5
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.970
Jae Hyun.

6
00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.270
I can't believe I'm seeing you here.

7
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.809
Do you go to this school?

8
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.809
Yes, thank you.

9
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.779
Wait.

10
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.520
Why are you in England?

11
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.619
I'm on a trip.

12
00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.020
I'm here to see a friend who goes to this school.

13
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.160
I see.

14
00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:36.919
Anyway, it's good to see you.

15
00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:37.960
You too.

16
00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:41.999
I'm sorry. I have to go to class.

17
00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.359
You should go.

18
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.729
Enjoy your trip and fly home safe.

19
00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:46.800
Thank you.

20
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.240
Bye.

21
00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:10.759
Hey, where's water?

22
00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.630
Bring me water!

23
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.699
Goodness.

24
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.799
Hey, you know nothing about life.

25
00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.400
Goodness, he's at it again.

26
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.070
What are you doing?

27
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.769
Hey, what are you doing here?

28
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.679
(September 2018)

29
00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:30.040
- Why are you doing this? - Come here.

30
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.509
Let go.

31
00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.109
Where am I?

32
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.579
What do you think? It's a police station.

33
00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.679
What?

34
00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.419
Excuse me. Officer. Please stop him.

35
00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:41.690
Hey.

36
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.160
You're a police officer. How can you sleep at work?

37
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.190
Please, stop.

38
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.199
- Stop it. - How dare you...

39
00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.000
Why do you cause trouble every morning?

40
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.729
Go home! Leave!

41
00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.070
No, I won't.

42
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.070
My wife is really scary.

43
00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.470
- Goodness. - I want to sleep.

44
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.940
- My gosh. - I'm going to sleep here.

45
00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.280
- What is this? - Let me sleep here.

46
00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.579
Did I become a police officer?

47
00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.380
My goodness.

48
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.350
Officer Bong.

49
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.019
You must feel out of place because you just started.

50
00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.419
I do too even though I've been here 30 years,

51
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.929
Excuse me. What year is it?

52
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.160
Hey.

53
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.400
You're too handsome to joke around.

54
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.470
It's 2018.

55
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.169
2018. Did you say 2018?

56
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.139
Are you still asleep? What's wrong with you?

57
00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.750
We have to patrol the streets.

58
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.679
I'll go grab my jacket. Get ready.

59
00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:41.150
Hurry up.

60
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.150
2018.

61
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.389
(Episode 11, Love always runs away)

62
00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:55.959
(Seoul Gangbuk Police Station)

63
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.040
I was supposed to go back to the past.

64
00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.970
Why am I in the future?

65
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.139
Hey.

66
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.310
Hey, who are you?

67
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.419
What are you doing?

68
00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:43.309
That's right.

69
00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.179
It wasn't midnight yet,

70
00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:48.020
but I got sucked into the manhole.

71
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.850
This never happened before.

72
00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.220
Why did this happen?

73
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.290
- Already? - Pardon?

74
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.629
Well, obviously I'm much...

75
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.400
older than you.

76
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.799
I don't think this is right.

77
00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:06.129
What do you mean?

78
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.239
Should I drive?

79
00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:10.069
Fine. I'll drive.

80
00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:13.770
I see. Wait, I'm sorry. I'll drive.

81
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.679
No, I'll do it. I can drive safely.

82
00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:18.150
No, I'll drive.

83
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.850
Will you?

84
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.160
Goodness.

85
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.100
Ma'am, I'll help you.

86
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.470
I got it. It's all done.

87
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.100
No, it's okay.

88
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.040
Thank you. I'll push the cart.

89
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.040
Which way are you going?

90
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.470
- This way. - This way?

91
00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:47.879
- Goodness. - There.

92
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.080
- It's heavy. Be careful. - Okay, thank you.

93
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.280
- Take care. - Bye.

94
00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:57.280
Gosh, this used to be a nice neighborhood.

95
00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.650
Why do you say that? Is there a problem?

96
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.760
You talk as if you don't know anything.

97
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.660
There have been a lot of assaults at night,

98
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.460
so all the residents don't come out after dark.

99
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.600
If I catch that culprit...

100
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.669
I'm going to...

101
00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.499
Please report your location.

102
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.169
We're patrolling Haewoo-dong area.

103
00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.080
101 Samho Villa, 21 Haewoo-dong.

104
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.150
Please check the resident's status.

105
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.720
Patrol car 11 is on the way.

106
00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:30.619
You heard that. Let's go to 21 Haewoo-dong.

107
00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.390
- Over there. - Okay.

108
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.869
- Hurry up. - Hurry.

109
00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:51.770
Please hurry up. This is the place.

110
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.169
Hurry up.

111
00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:54.379
Please hurry.

112
00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:55.979
This way.

113
00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.679
It's this way. Hurry.

114
00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:59.249
This is it.

115
00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.249
This the police. Please open the door.

116
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.520
It's no use.

117
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.689
I've been knocking on the door for a few days.

118
00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:10.160
But there's no answer.

119
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.960
Are you sure there's someone inside?

120
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.059
Maybe the person left home for a few days.

121
00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.600
I checked the surveillance video.

122
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:19.799
She hasn't come out of the house for a month.

123
00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:22.439
I'm afraid she might be dead.

124
00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:23.970
That's why I called you.

125
00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:27.809
I'll have to break in.

126
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.410
Officer Bong, call the locksmith.

127
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.280
Pardon? Well...

128
00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:36.049
I don't know the number.

129
00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:38.119
Come on.

130
00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:40.859
I told you to save the number on your phone.

131
00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:42.460
Did you forget?

132
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.590
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.290
Wait.

134
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.330
Hello? This is Sergeant Choi.

135
00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:54.569
I need your help.

136
00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:56.400
I'm at 101 Samho Villa.

137
00:07:58.109 --> 00:07:59.770
- It's open. - Thank you.

138
00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:03.540
Police patrol. We're coming in.

139
00:08:06.109 --> 00:08:07.179
Why is it so dark in here?

140
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.150
Officer Bong. Open the curtains.

141
00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:11.189
- Okay. - Gosh, it stinks.

142
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:19.059
I'm new to being a police officer.

143
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.760
But I'm already at a crime scene.

144
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.069
This is too much. It's just too much.

145
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.179
Sir. Over here.

146
00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.480
Hey. Are you okay?

147
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.719
Wait.

148
00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:46.089
I'll call 911.

149
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.929
Hello.

150
00:08:53.929 --> 00:08:56.299
101 Samho Villa, 21 Haewoo-dong.

151
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.829
A woman is unconscious. Please hurry.

152
00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:00.169
Okay.

153
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.169
You don't want to be seen with me?

154
00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:04.309
Well, it's not that.

155
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.410
Hey.

156
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.240
Honey, do you know him?

157
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.309
No, I don't.

158
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.549
It's her.

159
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.849
It's the woman who dated the pharmacist.

160
00:09:33.199 --> 00:09:36.500
She fainted because of malnutrition and anemia.

161
00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:39.040
It's not serious though.

162
00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:41.839
With the IV, she'll recover soon.

163
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.579
That's good to hear.

164
00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:45.079
I heard...

165
00:09:45.079 --> 00:09:47.949
she didn't leave her house for a month.

166
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.579
Yes, the neighbor called and reported.

167
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.589
If she hasn't been eating,

168
00:09:53.589 --> 00:09:55.360
and she hasn't left her home,

169
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.329
it seems she has a bigger problem.

170
00:09:58.329 --> 00:10:00.130
When she wakes up,

171
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.059
she should see a psychologist.

172
00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:06.270
I understand. I'll take care of it.

173
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.099
Okay. Bye.

174
00:10:08.099 --> 00:10:09.169
Bye.

175
00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:12.240
I'll call the station.

176
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.809
You stay here.

177
00:10:13.809 --> 00:10:14.880
Okay.

178
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.150
Why did she become like this?

179
00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:28.689
She had pictures she took with the pharmacist.

180
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.730
It looks like they're still dating.

181
00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:35.799
What's going on?

182
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:42.169
Excuse me. Are you awake?

183
00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:45.270
Where am I?

184
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.240
You're in a hospital. I'm a patrol officer.

185
00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:51.380
Your neighbor called and made a report.

186
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.809
You were unconscious when I found you.

187
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.349
I see.

188
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.360
I heard you didn't leave home for a month.

189
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.020
Did something happen?

190
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.760
No, nothing happened.

191
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:10.059
I just didn't want to go out.

192
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.770
Well,

193
00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:17.240
you know Park Jae Hyun, don't you?

194
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.809
How do you know him?

195
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.650
I know him personally.

196
00:11:26.049 --> 00:11:27.049
As far as I know,

197
00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:30.579
you two dated for a long time.

198
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.549
By any chance, do you still see him now?

199
00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:35.020
Look.

200
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.260
If you really know him,

201
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.730
please tell him...

202
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.630
that I'm at the hospital now.

203
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.959
Jae Hyun won't see me...

204
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.829
when I'm suffering so much because of him.

205
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:47.900
So...

206
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.140
please tell him on my behalf.

207
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.569
If he hears that I'm at the hospital,

208
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:55.579
he might be worried and come to see me.

209
00:11:59.049 --> 00:12:00.079
What's wrong?

210
00:12:00.849 --> 00:12:01.919
It's nothing.

211
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.620
The patient is awake.

212
00:12:04.689 --> 00:12:05.890
Are you okay?

213
00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:10.319
You may leave now.

214
00:12:10.319 --> 00:12:11.630
I'll take care of the rest.

215
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.660
Yes, sir.

216
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.510
She seemed fine when I saw her last.

217
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.110
What happened to her?

218
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.309
So Jae Hyun broke up with her.

219
00:12:34.049 --> 00:12:35.780
Is he dating Soo Jin then?

220
00:12:37.349 --> 00:12:38.490
No, no.

221
00:12:38.689 --> 00:12:41.189
It can't be since she's going to study abroad.

222
00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:46.089
What?

223
00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.130
That's Jae Hyun.

224
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.270
What?

225
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.699
Why did she come in Soo Jin's house?

226
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.270
It's so great to have tea together like this...

227
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.169
after a long time.

228
00:12:59.169 --> 00:13:00.270
I know.

229
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.740
Maybe I didn't come to see you for so long.

230
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.750
Let's often have some tea like this from now on.

231
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.679
I'd love that. Call me anytime.

232
00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:11.589
By the way, didn't you have something to say?

233
00:13:12.349 --> 00:13:15.959
Oh, what I wanted to talk about is...

234
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.760
If you're okay with it,

235
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.730
how about we go on a trip together?

236
00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:23.760
Gosh, that sounds great.

237
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.230
It'll soon be the season for autumn colors too.

238
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.370
No, we're talking about...

239
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.910
a trip abroad.

240
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.439
There are a lot of good and cheap trip packages.

241
00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:38.150
Travel abroad?

242
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:41.179
Isn't it too expensive though?

243
00:13:41.179 --> 00:13:43.520
Come on. Pil's got a job,

244
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.189
so ask him to pay for it.

245
00:13:45.849 --> 00:13:49.189
We're not paying for our trip either.

246
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.230
Then who's paying for it?

247
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.799
It's obvious.

248
00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:56.299
There's only one person who'd do that.

249
00:14:03.169 --> 00:14:04.410
Mother and Father, I'm here.

250
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.140
- Hi. - You're here.

251
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.079
Hello. I didn't know you're here too.

252
00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:11.809
- Hello. - It's nice to see you.

253
00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.179
Come sit here.

254
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.549
You said you'd pay for our trip abroad,

255
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:24.059
so we're suggesting that they join us.

256
00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:25.329
I see.

257
00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:27.189
It's good to have a company.

258
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:28.199
Right.

259
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.900
Gosh, what is that?

260
00:14:32.169 --> 00:14:33.230
Oh, this?

261
00:14:34.169 --> 00:14:35.969
I brought you some supplements.

262
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.969
I put enough vitamins and iron.

263
00:14:38.969 --> 00:14:40.209
Make sure you have it.

264
00:14:40.209 --> 00:14:41.309
Goodness.

265
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.449
We're still not done with what you gave us before.

266
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.049
You don't need to do this.

267
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.919
Right, you really don't have to do this.

268
00:14:51.049 --> 00:14:53.419
We told him not to do this so many times,

269
00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:54.819
but he continues to be like this.

270
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.790
Gosh, it's hot.

271
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.530
Hey.

272
00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:09.099
What are you doing here, Dad and Mom?

273
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.370
We're here to have some tea.

274
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.969
Why did you come here and not home after work?

275
00:15:12.969 --> 00:15:16.140
I mean, I saw him go in this house.

276
00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:19.250
Why are you sitting here?

277
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.280
Goodness.

278
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.750
Why is it strange for our son-in-law to visit us?

279
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.719
You're being very strange.

280
00:15:26.219 --> 00:15:28.719
What? What did you just say?

281
00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.059
Son-in-law?

282
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.390
Who? This punk?

283
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.589
What do you mean, this punk?

284
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.599
Pil, watch your language to our son-in-law.

285
00:15:36.929 --> 00:15:39.630
What's wrong with him? Let us take him out of here.

286
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.669
- Goodness. - We'll see you later.

287
00:15:42.669 --> 00:15:43.870
Come out.

288
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.010
- Son-in-law? - Goodness.

289
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.110
- What's wrong with you? - Come out!

290
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.010
Goodness.

291
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.510
Is he drunk?

292
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.980
Pil is becoming stranger by the day.

293
00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:56.020
I know. I wonder when he'll grow up.

294
00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.890
Please understand.

295
00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.919
Sure.

296
00:16:02.719 --> 00:16:04.730
Goodness.

297
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.160
Goodness, seriously.

298
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.699
You crazy brat.

299
00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:11.569
I can keep face because of you embarrass me.

300
00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:13.270
Did you drink a pack of soju...

301
00:16:13.599 --> 00:16:14.770
on your way or something?

302
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.299
No, I'm completely sober.

303
00:16:17.439 --> 00:16:19.270
And what are you talking about?

304
00:16:19.469 --> 00:16:22.240
Soo Jin is studying abroad so how is she married?

305
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.809
She went back and got married a long time ago.

306
00:16:24.809 --> 00:16:26.349
What nonsense are you talking about?

307
00:16:26.349 --> 00:16:28.919
You must be drunk for certain.

308
00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:30.250
Go in your room and sleep.

309
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.419
No.

310
00:16:32.089 --> 00:16:33.790
I won't believe you...

311
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.120
unless I see it myself.

312
00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:39.929
Hey, Pil!

313
00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:41.099
- Honey. - Goodness.

314
00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:44.199
Is he really my son?

315
00:16:45.569 --> 00:16:47.270
I doubt the fact too sometimes.

316
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.439
Excuse me.

317
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.780
How can I...

318
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.209
Wait, you're Soo Jin's friend.

319
00:16:57.209 --> 00:16:58.209
Yes.

320
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.709
Soo Jin went to study abroad, right?

321
00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:03.049
What are you talking about?

322
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.790
She got married and quit working a long time ago.

323
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.420
You're her friend, and you don't know it?

324
00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.369
You left work for today?

325
00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.339
Dal Soo.

326
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.809
Did you know Soo Jin got married?

327
00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.210
What are you talking about?

328
00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.180
It's been a year since she got married.

329
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:31.680
A year?

330
00:17:33.609 --> 00:17:36.220
No, she said she was going to study abroad.

331
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:39.089
How could she get married without my knowing?

332
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.089
You're scaring me.

333
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.190
You caused a mess...

334
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.059
when we went to send the wedding box to her house.

335
00:17:47.159 --> 00:17:48.659
What are you talking about now?

336
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.200
Gosh, it's so loud. I can't stand it.

337
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.839
You terrible scum!

338
00:17:58.909 --> 00:18:00.639
He's awake.

339
00:18:00.639 --> 00:18:02.139
Pil, can you hear me?

340
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:05.349
Here's the wedding invitation.

341
00:18:05.349 --> 00:18:06.549
(To my friend, Pil)

342
00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:10.889
Dal Soo.

343
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.490
Did I get beaten up by Jae Hyun?

344
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:15.790
Yes.

345
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.859
You got beaten up by him,

346
00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:19.930
so I carried you on my back...

347
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.799
and took you to Jin Sook's house.

348
00:18:24.599 --> 00:18:25.599
So...

349
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.170
I traveled a year to the future...

350
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.670
from when I first traveled time through the manhole.

351
00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:34.510
This isn't the situation within the time travel.

352
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.879
It's reality.

353
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.879
Police officer.

354
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.750
What's wrong with you? Goodness.

355
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.649
It must be because of lack of sleep.

356
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.819
Go home and get some sleep.

357
00:19:13.379 --> 00:19:15.349
(Visitors have arrived in front of your house.)

358
00:19:15.379 --> 00:19:17.149
Who is it?

359
00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:24.629
- What brings you here? - Hi.

360
00:19:25.089 --> 00:19:26.329
Welcome.

361
00:19:26.359 --> 00:19:27.760
Soo Jin!

362
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.099
Hi, Soo Jin.

363
00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:31.430
We came to have some juice.

364
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:32.670
What were you doing?

365
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.470
I was making a lunch box for my husband.

366
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.899
Wait, no.

367
00:19:36.899 --> 00:19:38.609
Have these fruits instead.

368
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.010
It's been a while since you last visited here.

369
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.980
Jin Sook and I are busy doing our business.

370
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:48.180
To be specific,

371
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.750
it's only Jin Sook who's busy all the time.

372
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.520
I handed you my truck on a great business spot.

373
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:54.619
How can it not be successful?

374
00:19:54.659 --> 00:19:57.089
I know. I trusted you when I first took it over.

375
00:19:57.089 --> 00:19:59.030
I'm not sure why it isn't going well.

376
00:19:59.329 --> 00:20:01.299
Still, you can trust on the taste of my juice.

377
00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:02.359
Have a glass.

378
00:20:03.329 --> 00:20:04.399
Here.

379
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.379
What are you talking about?

380
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.309
It's been a year since she got married.

381
00:20:30.589 --> 00:20:33.359
Are you still not seeing Dal Soo by the way?

382
00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.829
Let's not talk about it.

383
00:20:36.829 --> 00:20:38.200
It'll only upset us.

384
00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:39.399
Okay.

385
00:20:39.799 --> 00:20:42.869
What about you, Jin Sook?

386
00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:45.010
I had no idea...

387
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.710
that you would date him.

388
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.540
Right, I'm curious too.

389
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.109
What do you like about him?

390
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.950
It's not like I date him because of something.

391
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.020
You never know what will happen to you after all.

392
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.119
We're in Soo Jin's house. Let's stop this talk.

393
00:20:57.119 --> 00:20:58.690
How is everything with Jae Hyun?

394
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.159
You must be having a wonderful marriage life,

395
00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.089
seeing how you make a lunchbox for him.

396
00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:04.629
You're such a devoted wife.

397
00:21:04.629 --> 00:21:07.960
I'm happy all the time.

398
00:21:10.329 --> 00:21:13.099
- Goodness. - It's making me cringe.

399
00:21:13.399 --> 00:21:15.970
Hey, the time. It's 12pm already.

400
00:21:16.099 --> 00:21:17.569
Don't you have to open your stores?

401
00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:19.040
- It's 12pm already. - Oh, right.

402
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.740
- Let's go. - I'll go out with you.

403
00:21:23.139 --> 00:21:24.379
Have a great day.

404
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.680
- Sure. - And eat well, okay?

405
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.879
- Okay. - See you at Bongbong Pub.

406
00:21:27.879 --> 00:21:29.280
Okay, I won't be late.

407
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280
- Okay. - Bye.

408
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.389
Have a great day.

409
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.290
How can I help you today?

410
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.629
My eyes are too dim,

411
00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:18.069
and tears keep on coming out.

412
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.369
Are the symptoms the same after using the medicine?

413
00:22:21.369 --> 00:22:23.940
It seemed to get better,

414
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.040
but it happened again.

415
00:22:25.569 --> 00:22:28.980
I'll make an appointment with an optometrist today.

416
00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:30.180
You have to go, okay?

417
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.280
I'll be very thankful if you would do that.

418
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.020
Mr. Park.

419
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:38.389
My knees have been hurting every single night.

420
00:22:38.389 --> 00:22:39.589
What should I do?

421
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:42.920
I'll give you some heat packs.

422
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.530
Warm your knees up before you go to bed.

423
00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.760
And don't strain yourself climbing mountains.

424
00:22:49.859 --> 00:22:51.530
Hey, Soo Jin.

425
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.670
Look.

426
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.569
Did you make all this?

427
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.109
You said you were sick of eating out.

428
00:23:02.109 --> 00:23:04.710
So I decided to cook for once.

429
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.809
It looks great.

430
00:23:14.889 --> 00:23:16.059
It's really good.

431
00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:19.089
Try this one too.

432
00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:28.670
Oh, right.

433
00:23:29.139 --> 00:23:31.109
I met Pil at your dad's when I stopped by.

434
00:23:31.569 --> 00:23:32.839
- Pil? - Yes.

435
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:34.980
He must've been drunk or something.

436
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.879
He said something odd when he walked in.

437
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.349
I don't think he can accept that we're married.

438
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.649
He said he can't believe how I'm married to you.

439
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.889
Goodness, Pil.

440
00:23:48.359 --> 00:23:50.119
That must've been awkward for you.

441
00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.089
He looked drunk, so I'll let him slide.

442
00:23:56.299 --> 00:23:58.000
Eat up.

443
00:23:58.369 --> 00:23:59.500
Do you want this?

444
00:24:03.139 --> 00:24:04.740
How did things turn out like this?

445
00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:16.180
Hey.

446
00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.849
- I have something to say. - Yes?

447
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.520
I...

448
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.659
want to start running a studio.

449
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:27.829
Would it be okay for me to open it up again?

450
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.500
It hasn't been long since you closed it.

451
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.799
You've worked hard until now.

452
00:24:36.139 --> 00:24:37.609
Don't you deserve a longer break?

453
00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:41.339
I don't think I'm the housekeeping type.

454
00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:43.980
I'm dying to work.

455
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.710
Really?

456
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.750
Then let's give it a thought.

457
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:49.950
Okay.

458
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.690
Oh, we're meeting my friends tonight.

459
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.020
I know. I'll be there as soon as I close.

460
00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.260
Okay.

461
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.869
- Are you all right? - Yes.

462
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.899
- Honey. - I ate too much.

463
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.740
I'll go get something to drink.

464
00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.710
My friend runs a juice truck nearby.

465
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:13.740
Sure.

466
00:25:14.309 --> 00:25:16.010
Keep eating, okay?

467
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:22.420
Hey, Pil.

468
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.549
What are you doing here?

469
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.490
Oh, I'm on my way home after work.

470
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.190
I heard you said something odd at my parents' house.

471
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.299
Oh, it's...

472
00:25:36.829 --> 00:25:39.599
I'm sorry. I must've been out of it.

473
00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:41.170
You should stop drinking.

474
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.970
You'll ruin your health.

475
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:45.940
Soo Jin.

476
00:25:47.369 --> 00:25:48.540
Are you...

477
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.010
really married?

478
00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.349
What are you talking about?

479
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.980
It's just that...

480
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.119
I still can't believe it.

481
00:25:57.889 --> 00:25:59.690
You're not sober yet.

482
00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:01.619
Go home and sleep.

483
00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:03.559
I'll see you tonight at Bongbong Pub.

484
00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:06.490
You do know that we're meeting up tonight, right?

485
00:26:06.829 --> 00:26:08.659
Yes, right.

486
00:26:09.659 --> 00:26:10.659
Okay.

487
00:26:10.659 --> 00:26:12.569
Okay, then. See you later.

488
00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:30.950
How are your shoulders?

489
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.089
I feel much better after your massage.

490
00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:38.859
You must've strained yourself because of Pil.

491
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.899
Gosh, I'm so frustrated whenever I think of him.

492
00:26:42.899 --> 00:26:44.930
I guess he still thinks of Soo Jin...

493
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.700
whenever he gets drunk.

494
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.569
He can't get over 28 years of feelings at once.

495
00:26:50.569 --> 00:26:52.069
Time will do the magic.

496
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.579
I hate how Soo Jin's mom boasts about Jae Hyun,

497
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.879
and I hate seeing Pil...

498
00:26:58.879 --> 00:27:00.549
all by himself without a girlfriend.

499
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:02.349
Then what can we do?

500
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:06.319
These...

501
00:27:06.849 --> 00:27:09.790
are the women interested in a blind date with him.

502
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.589
Let's see.

503
00:27:13.159 --> 00:27:14.299
What about her?

504
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:16.829
Her eyes are very kind. Doesn't she look nice?

505
00:27:18.569 --> 00:27:22.369
I feel like she might be nicer than her.

506
00:27:22.369 --> 00:27:23.639
The corners of her mouth...

Pil has no intention of going on a blind date.

He might change his mind once he meets them.

I mean, all of them are as great as Soo Jin.

00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:48.170
- I'll bring some chairs. - Okay.

676
00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:51.469
You look pretty today.

677
00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.009
What about the studio?

678
00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:56.909
No, I didn't get permission yet.

679
00:36:56.909 --> 00:36:58.309
- You're the hardest... - Really?

680
00:36:58.309 --> 00:37:00.880
- one to get used to. - I'll ask again...

681
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.380
later.

682

(Bongbong Pub)

683
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.070
Cheers!

684
00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.009
- Cheers! - Cheers!

685
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.440
- Don't drink too much. - Just this one.

686
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.820
How can Jae Hyun be so nice to Soo Jin?

687
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.550
When I get married,

688
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.349
I want my husband to love me a lot.

689
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:40.020
Me too.

690
00:37:40.389 --> 00:37:42.389
Jang Ae, how was business today?

691
00:37:42.389 --> 00:37:44.590
I had no customers.

692
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.259
Please give me some advice.

693
00:37:47.259 --> 00:37:50.099
CEO Yoon Jin Sook is the business expert.

694
00:37:50.099 --> 00:37:51.369
Okay.

695
00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:53.570
I'll tell you all about my business skills.

696
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.699
You'll have to serve me free juice forever though.

697
00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:59.239
- All right. - Me too.

698
00:37:59.239 --> 00:38:00.239
Come on.

699
00:38:00.469 --> 00:38:01.980
By the way,

700
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.150
isn't Dal Soo coming tonight?

701
00:38:04.809 --> 00:38:05.809
Hey.

702
00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.980
How dare he come here?

703
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.920
He left us and this neighborhood.

704
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.050
He should be ashamed of himself.

705
00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.690
Come on, Goo Gil.

706
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.889
He's working at his dad's company.

707
00:38:16.889 --> 00:38:19.460
So he must be a chief now.

708
00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.529
He should show up looking all cool.

709
00:38:22.529 --> 00:38:25.029
Why do you think he's working for his dad?

710
00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:27.099
He got sick...

711
00:38:27.099 --> 00:38:29.739
of living like a poor commoner.

712
00:38:29.739 --> 00:38:31.570
Do you think he'll show up here?

713
00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.880
I'll bet my entire fortune on him not showing up.

714
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:43.079
Let's not talk about Dal Soo.

715
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.489
- Okay. - All right.

716
00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:46.820
- Cheers. - Cheers.

717
00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:47.920
Seriously, don't talk about Dal Soo.

718
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.159
We shouldn't talk about someone who isn't here.

719
00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.630
This is good.

720
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.400
This is delicious.

721
00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:03.139
It's yummy.

722
00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:27.699
(Bongbong Pub)

723
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.469
Now that I think about it,

724
00:39:38.469 --> 00:39:41.779
Soo Jin's wedding was a turning point for us.

725
00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:44.579
Pil and Seok Tae passed the civil servant exam.

726
00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:46.449
Jung Ae got a food truck.

727
00:39:46.449 --> 00:39:48.449
I started a business and became a CEO.

728
00:39:48.449 --> 00:39:50.250
And you...

729
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.250
Goo Gil...

730
00:39:51.849 --> 00:39:53.750
What about me?

731
00:39:55.219 --> 00:39:56.860
You're right.

732
00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.829
Soo Jin's wedding brought us luck.

733
00:39:59.929 --> 00:40:02.130
We started dating, right?

734
00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:03.130
Yes.

735
00:40:03.529 --> 00:40:06.099
Why didn't that luck come to me?

736
00:40:07.199 --> 00:40:08.570
What's wrong with a pool hall?

737
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:09.969
You're making a living.

738
00:40:09.969 --> 00:40:11.009
It earns you a lot of money.

739
00:40:11.009 --> 00:40:12.369
Thanks, Jung Ae.

740
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.440
That's very comforting.

741
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:17.009
Don't be too touched.

742
00:40:22.679 --> 00:40:25.619
Well, since we're both here,

743
00:40:25.619 --> 00:40:27.590
I want to apologize to you.

744
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:31.489
There was a small incident before the wedding.

745
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.659
I was too rash then.

746
00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:37.469
- Come on. - Come on.

747
00:40:37.469 --> 00:40:39.329
Pil deserved it.

748
00:40:39.329 --> 00:40:41.770
I'd say it was an excessive friendship.

749
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.040
No need to apologize.

750
00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.670
No, I should apologize.

751
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:49.779
I'm very sorry.

752
00:40:51.279 --> 00:40:55.119
Gosh, Jae Hyun is such a gentleman.

753
00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.389
It was just a happening.

754
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.860
Hey, Pil.

755
00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.460
Get over it already, won't you?

756
00:41:05.489 --> 00:41:08.730
By the way, are you seeing anyone?

757
00:41:11.699 --> 00:41:13.099
Why do you ask?

758
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:16.840
Well, everyone has a partner.

759
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.670
I think you'd feel lonely.

760
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.940
I don't feel lonely.

761
00:41:24.409 --> 00:41:26.279
You don't need to worry.

762
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.619
Right, there must be someone out there.

763
00:41:33.619 --> 00:41:34.619
Like me and Seok Tae.

764
00:41:34.619 --> 00:41:37.389
You two are nothing...

765
00:41:37.389 --> 00:41:39.630
compared to Jae Hyun and Soo Jin.

766
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.000
They met while studying abroad in England.

767
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.429
And they got married.

768
00:41:43.699 --> 00:41:47.029
That's what you call fate.

769
00:41:47.029 --> 00:41:48.270
I'm so envious.

770
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.070
- Soo Jin. - Yes?

771
00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.309
Did you two meet while studying abroad?

772
00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:54.809
Yes.

773
00:41:55.509 --> 00:41:57.380
It's so amazing to think back even now.

774
00:41:57.779 --> 00:41:58.949
Right?

775
00:42:02.849 --> 00:42:04.690
Hold on. Where did it go?

776
00:42:09.989 --> 00:42:12.029
Hey, it's you, Soo Jin.

777
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.360
Hey.

778
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.559
Jae Hyun.

779
00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:20.670
Soo Jin.

780
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.980
What? Jae Hyun.

781
00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:32.250
- We meet again. - What is this?

782
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.750
How did you know I was here?

783
00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:36.119
I don't know.

784
00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:38.920
I think someone planned this out for us,

785
00:42:39.219 --> 00:42:41.389
so we can go on a date.

786
00:42:43.759 --> 00:42:45.059
In that sense,

787
00:42:45.259 --> 00:42:47.190
how about we have dinner together today?

788
00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.099
Sure.

789
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.829
I realized it then.

790
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.639
That there's really a destiny.

791
00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:59.710
It's like a scene from "Before Sunrise".

792
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.909
It's so romantic.

793
00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:08.079
Are you coming back from somewhere?

794
00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:10.750
Hi, Jae Hyun. We went to buy the wedding gifts.

795
00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.619
Congratulations on your wedding.

796
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.259
Thank you.

797
00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.559
I didn't believe in destiny either.

798
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.190
But I came to believe it after I met her.

799
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:23.900
Excuse me.

800
00:43:24.469 --> 00:43:26.469
- It's romantic. - Goodness.

801
00:43:26.469 --> 00:43:28.699
- Yes. - What about you?

802
00:43:28.699 --> 00:43:30.809
- I'll be right there. - Goodness.

803
00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:32.710
I need to go move my car for someone.

804
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.409
- Hey. - They serve nice steaks.

805
00:43:35.409 --> 00:43:37.880
- Not fish and chips? - Their steaks are good.

806
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.610
- He doesn't know. - I do.

807
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:40.610
The steaks are good.

808
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:41.920
- Really? - Does it rain a lot?

809
00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.219
- Yes. - Where are you going?

810
00:43:43.219 --> 00:43:44.219
- Medium? - I...

811
00:43:44.219 --> 00:43:45.219
Rare?

812
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.090
Pil, why are you outside?

813
00:43:51.489 --> 00:43:54.529
I wanted to get some fresh air.

814
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.630
I think all Soo Jin's friends are nice.

815
00:44:00.029 --> 00:44:02.770
Can I join this gathering often from now on?

816
00:44:06.009 --> 00:44:08.139
You said you ran into her in England.

817
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.980
It wasn't a coincidence, was it?

818
00:44:11.779 --> 00:44:14.449
Pardon? What do you mean?

819
00:44:14.849 --> 00:44:17.849
I feel like you approached her intentionally.

820
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.820
You knew she'd go study abroad...

821
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.059
and followed her. Something like that.

822
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.869
Pil, you're funny.

823
00:44:32.099 --> 00:44:33.800
How did you think of that?

824
00:44:34.699 --> 00:44:36.400
I guess you don't want to believe...

825
00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.070
we're meant to be together.

826
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.469
I know you liked her very much in the past.

827
00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:43.579
Still, she's married now.

828
00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.679
I hope you can keep your boundaries.

829
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:48.679
I'll see how you do first.

830
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:53.090
What do you mean?

831
00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:01.029
That was witty.

832
00:45:01.929 --> 00:45:05.099
Wait a second. Where's Jae Hyun?

833
00:45:05.099 --> 00:45:07.770
He went to move his car. I guess he's still outside.

834
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:09.869
Wait. Pil isn't here either.

835
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.340
He went outside when Jae Hyun did.

836
00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.909
Maybe they're having a men's talk outside.

837
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.509
Right, men become much closer with each other...

838
00:45:19.509 --> 00:45:20.949
after some fight.

839
00:45:20.949 --> 00:45:22.449
Leave them be.

840
00:45:22.449 --> 00:45:23.449
All right.

841
00:45:23.449 --> 00:45:25.349
- Cheers. - Cheers.

842
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.719
It sounds like...

843
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.360
you'll take my place...

844
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:33.259
if I'm not good to her.

845
00:45:33.259 --> 00:45:36.000
Oh, you understood it that way.

846
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.630
I didn't mean that.

847
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:45.110
I don't want to have this emotional fight with you.

848
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.210
Let's go in.

849
00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:50.279
When did you break up with Park Young Ju?

850
00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:58.690
I happened to go to her house because of work.

851
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:02.290
She was suffering a lot emotionally.

852
00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:03.759
It seemed like...

853
00:46:05.059 --> 00:46:06.790
it was because of you.

854
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.369
She needs to get over the break up by herself.

855
00:46:13.429 --> 00:46:15.500
Should I be responsible for her after we broke up?

856
00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.239
There are manners to be kept when you break up.

857
00:46:18.409 --> 00:46:20.070
I'm wondering if it was because...

858
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:23.540
you ended things with her in a wrong way.

859
00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.110
What do you know about me to say such a thing?

860
00:46:27.179 --> 00:46:29.920
Do you have any idea how hard it was for me?

861
00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:32.920
She kept on monitoring me and was obsessed with me.

862
00:46:33.389 --> 00:46:34.989
I'm the victim.

863
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:38.090
Why do I have to hear such a thing from you?

864
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:45.699
You might know if you saw her today.

865
00:46:46.369 --> 00:46:48.300
She has a mental problem.

866
00:46:48.699 --> 00:46:52.110
And you trusted what she said and suspected me.

867
00:46:52.369 --> 00:46:53.509
I'm speechless.

868
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.279
But...

869
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.279
why can't I trust...

870
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.020
anything you say?

871
00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.079
The Park Jae Hyun I know...

872
00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.219
always went for something unrighteous...

873
00:47:07.989 --> 00:47:10.219
behind that innocent mask of his.

874
00:47:10.219 --> 00:47:12.860
Look, Pil.

875
00:47:12.889 --> 00:47:14.090
Stop, Jae Hyun.

876
00:47:19.099 --> 00:47:20.099
Pil.

877
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.340
How could you say such a thing?

878
00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:26.940
What do you know about him to say so?

879
00:47:27.909 --> 00:47:29.440
It's all right. Let's stop.

880
00:47:31.079 --> 00:47:33.279
I'll go first. Come home when it's over.

881
00:47:33.509 --> 00:47:34.550
Jae Hyun.

882
00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:36.279
Jae Hyun.

883
00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:39.349
Jae Hyun.

884
00:47:42.889 --> 00:47:45.259
Jae Hyun.

885
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.389
You can't leave like this.

886
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.259
I told you to come later. Don't follow me.

887
00:47:49.259 --> 00:47:51.699
You must've felt terrible because of him.

888
00:47:51.699 --> 00:47:53.469
I apologize on his behalf.

889
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:56.469
What is he that you apologize on his behalf?

890
00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.610
What?

891
00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:02.779
Because he's my friend...

892
00:48:03.639 --> 00:48:05.710
Why on earth do you go out for that gathering?

893
00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.619
What do you mean?

894
00:48:10.179 --> 00:48:11.420
Be honest.

895
00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:13.820
Do you go there to meet your friends?

896
00:48:14.489 --> 00:48:17.020
Or do you have someone you must see there?

897
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.730
What do you mean, I have someone I must see?

898
00:48:24.699 --> 00:48:26.829
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

899
00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:29.969
Nothing. Forget it.

900
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:33.210
Try not to join that gathering from now on.

901
00:48:33.739 --> 00:48:35.409
If you have to, go alone.

902
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.750
It's tiring to hang out with your friends.

903
00:48:41.179 --> 00:48:42.320
Jae Hyun.

904
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:45.420
Jae Hyun.

905
00:48:46.219 --> 00:48:47.320
Jae Hyun.

906
00:48:49.119 --> 00:48:50.219
What...

907
00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:18.590
(Family DVD Rental)

908
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:55.090
You dropped this.

909
00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:57.960
You dropped this.

910
00:50:00.059 --> 00:50:01.829
I said you dropped this.

911
00:50:20.009 --> 00:50:23.179
Who parked this car in front of the store?

912
00:50:23.679 --> 00:50:24.989
Goodness.

913
00:50:27.719 --> 00:50:30.219
You really didn't have to walk me to here.

914
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.889
What do you mean?

915
00:50:32.159 --> 00:50:34.329
Don't you know it's dangerous?

916
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.900
Don't walk around alone at night.

917
00:50:37.059 --> 00:50:38.300
Thank you.

918
00:50:39.329 --> 00:50:40.800
I feel safe.

919
00:50:41.699 --> 00:50:43.770
- I'll see you later then. - Well...

920
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.679
Don't you feel good about meeting the kids tonight?

921
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.409
Yes, I was feeling down lately,

922
00:50:51.409 --> 00:50:53.449
but I feel much better now that I met with them.

923
00:50:53.449 --> 00:50:54.820
See?

924
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:59.449
Don't be so stressed out for the juice truck.

925
00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:02.790
You'll have many customers soon.

926
00:51:03.159 --> 00:51:06.130
Right, every dog has its day.

927
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.529
I'll really go in. Bye.

928
00:51:08.529 --> 00:51:09.699
Bye.

929
00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:11.500
- Go first. - No, you go in first.

930
00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.869
All right.

931
00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:14.400
I'll see you later.

932
00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:17.610
Good night.

933
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.619
The juice truck?

934
00:51:44.599 --> 00:51:45.599
Soo Jin.

935
00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.980
I thought you went home with Jae Hyun.

936
00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.119
Oh, I stopped by because I had to...

937
00:52:01.119 --> 00:52:02.750
give you something.

938
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.290
This is great.

939
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.619
Take it.

940
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:06.820
Okay.

941
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.029
What is this?

942
00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:14.230
It's a box of our memories.

943
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.960
It has everything you've given me...

944
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:19.829
including toys, dolls, camera,

945
00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:22.000
and even pictures we took together.

946
00:52:22.369 --> 00:52:23.699
It's all in there.

947
00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.610
Why are you giving this to me?

948
00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.110
I thought this was the only way...

949
00:52:32.579 --> 00:52:36.079
we can settle our relationship for good.

950
00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.820
I...

951
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.489
will give your heart back with the box too.

952
00:52:47.699 --> 00:52:49.059
- Soo Jin. - Pil.

953
00:52:50.599 --> 00:52:53.199
When you didn't come to my wedding,

954
00:52:54.029 --> 00:52:56.869
and when you disrupted the wedding gift night,

955
00:52:57.469 --> 00:52:58.739
I understood everything.

956
00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.210
We've been friends for a very long time,

957
00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.710
so I understand how difficult it is...

958
00:53:05.009 --> 00:53:06.849
to accept that someone else is with me.

959
00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:10.020
If you said you were getting married,

960
00:53:10.579 --> 00:53:12.489
I think I would've felt the same way.

961
00:53:13.619 --> 00:53:14.860
But...

962
00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.230
we can't stay with each other for life.

963
00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:22.000
I know you aren't very fond of Jae Hyun,

964
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.230
but I hope...

965
00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:26.699
you can respect my decision.

966
00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:33.239
Pil, forget about the past as of today,

967
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:35.309
and return as my friend.

968
00:53:36.139 --> 00:53:37.139
Okay?

969
00:53:38.009 --> 00:53:39.150
So why don't we...

970
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:40.710
shake hands?

971
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.279
Let's have a great haul, my friend.

972
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:10.099
What were you thinking when you parked your car?

973
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.840
What about other people?

974
00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:13.739
I'll move it.

975
00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.880
Goodness, I don't believe your manners, young man.

976
00:55:17.009 --> 00:55:20.279
Shouldn't you be apologizing to me first?

977
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:27.250
Goodness.

978
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:32.829
Why are you getting off?

979
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:34.599
Move your car first.

980
00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:36.329
But...

981
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:39.730
why on earth are you talking down to me?

982
00:55:49.139 --> 00:55:50.980
If you want to park your car,

983
00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.349
be quiet and stay still.

984
00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:21.980
He wanted to break up with me.

985
00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.409
He said he found another woman.

986
00:56:24.809 --> 00:56:27.920
So what did you tell him?

987
00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.349
I told him I can't do that.

988
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.520
Jae Hyun didn't marry her because he loved her.

989
00:56:33.849 --> 00:56:35.860
He did it out of spite.

990
00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.889
Is that why you've been lingering around him...

991
00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.559
and keeping him under your watch?

992
00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:43.130
Doctor.

993
00:56:44.599 --> 00:56:46.570
I am the only one...

994
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:48.340
who can make Jae Hyun happy.

995
00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.239
She doesn't know anything about him.

996
00:56:53.869 --> 00:56:56.380
If she finds out his true colors,

997
00:56:58.349 --> 00:57:00.210
she won't be able to take it.

998
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:20.670
(Soo Jin is ugly.)

999
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.170
This is driving me nuts, Soo Jin.

1000
00:58:28.469 --> 00:58:31.070
I should congratulate you on your marriage,

1001
00:58:34.409 --> 00:58:35.909
and I should be saying,

1002
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:38.179
"I'm glad you look..."

1003
00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:41.449
"very happy."

1004
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:44.619
But...

1005
00:58:48.119 --> 00:58:50.420
I just can't do that.

1006
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:26.429
Yes, I can't live like this.

1007
00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.730
I came back to my reality,

1008
00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:30.800
and I finally became a police officer too.

1009
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:34.029
But without Soo Jin, my life is meaningless.

1010
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:47.150
Soo Jin.

1011
00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:49.219
I will turn everything around.

1012
00:59:49.679 --> 00:59:51.520
I will change this no matter what it takes...

1013
00:59:51.690 --> 00:59:53.020
to get you back.

1014
01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.329
What?

1015
01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440
What is this?

1016
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:16.940
Where did the manhole go?

1017
01:00:17.779 --> 01:00:18.880
What's...

1018
01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:25.020
What's going on?

1019
01:00:48.509 --> 01:00:51.579
(Manhole)

1020
01:00:52.509 --> 01:00:55.949
Soo Jin, we decided to be just friends,

1021
01:00:56.449 --> 01:00:57.989
but why is that so hard for me?

1022
01:00:58.119 --> 01:01:00.290
Did you ever have any feelings for Pil?

1023
01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.759
I'm serious.

1024
01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.020
What can I do to make you believe?

1025
01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.829
Forget about it. Just go.

1026
01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:06.630
Seok Tae, if you won't do it,

1027
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:07.960
I'll do it myself.

1028
01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:12.230
Is he really traveling through time?

1029
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:14.300
Do you love her more than you love me?

1030
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.199
That looks like his ex-girlfriend.

1031
01:01:16.469 --> 01:01:18.610
I thought they broke up. Why are they meeting up?
