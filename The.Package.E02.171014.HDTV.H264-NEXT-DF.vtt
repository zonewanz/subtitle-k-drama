<i>[This program is suitable

3
00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.475
<i>How will I live my life?</i>

4
00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.265
<i>This is what Goethe said.</i>

5
00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:33.826
<i>"Life isn't about speed, but direction."</i>

6
00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.548
<i>This is what Gandhi said.</i>

7
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.042
<i>"If the direction is wrong,
the speed doesn't matter."</i>

8
00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:55.076
<i>Life's answers can be found
in the prohibited direction.</i>

9
00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:59.960
<i>Will I... be able to find it?</i>

10
00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.075
<i>I found a woman, though.</i>

11
00:01:31.072 --> 00:01:33.828
<i>I developed a fever, starting that day.</i>

12
00:01:37.183 --> 00:01:40.171
Your temperature is normal. 36.5 degrees.

13
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:41.266
Thank you.

14
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.010
<i>The temperature of blossoming love</i>

15
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.951
<i>is 36.5 degrees.</i>

16
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:49.466
<i>[If you don't want to do it,
don't do it.]</i>

17
00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.450
Hello! I'm the new employee, San Ma Ru.

18
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.296
I'll work so hard,
you'll think I'm crazy...

19
00:02:06.213 --> 00:02:07.915
I'll do my best...

20
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:15.796
The key goals of the company...

21
00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:19.460
The goal that we need to achieve

22
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.889
is that if we do our best
in what we think is right...

23
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:28.316
<i>I developed a fever, once again.</i>

24
00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:33.312
You don't have a fever. You're normal.

25
00:02:35.248 --> 00:02:38.668
<i>I was always 36.5 degrees.</i>

26
00:02:50.248 --> 00:02:52.942
<i>I love you. Let's go out.</i>

27
00:02:52.942 --> 00:02:55.566
<i>I love you. Let's go out.</i>

28
00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:57.250
<i>I practiced is a thousand times.</i>

29
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.680
We shall love.

30
00:03:06.098 --> 00:03:10.645
I shall... hear that again.

31
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.241
<i>The fever disappeared without a trace.</i>

32
00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:36.038
<i>The love that won't change
until I die... is 36.5 degrees.</i>

33
00:04:31.423 --> 00:04:33.348
I'm not that kind of person.

34
00:04:34.213 --> 00:04:35.947
A friend asked me to buy these.

35
00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:39.778
- This is for my friend too.
- Hey.

36
00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:41.398
It's a big size.

37
00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:50.584
My friend said she likes it... bigger.

38
00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.552
Wait.

39
00:05:07.552 --> 00:05:09.663
So So, wait.

40
00:05:10.418 --> 00:05:13.461
Hold on. Geez, wait.

41
00:05:22.668 --> 00:05:23.975
Have fun.

42
00:05:33.627 --> 00:05:35.935
- You're not buying them?
- No.

43
00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.088
I thought it was a friend's request.

44
00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.795
It is, but I don't need to buy them.

45
00:05:58.588 --> 00:06:00.286
San Ma Ru.

46
00:06:03.033 --> 00:06:06.480
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

47
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.971
There are street bars over there.

48
00:06:08.971 --> 00:06:11.779
If you go up farther,
there are more intense street bars.

49
00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:13.637
They might have what you want.

50
00:06:13.637 --> 00:06:16.942
I'm not the kind of person
who wants those things.

51
00:06:16.942 --> 00:06:22.122
I told you that in France, they're
accepting of other people's tastes.

52
00:06:22.122 --> 00:06:24.803
I'm really... not into those things.

53
00:06:24.803 --> 00:06:27.533
Then, go back to the hotel.

54
00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:30.814
Travelers get scammed all the time here.

55
00:06:30.814 --> 00:06:34.230
Yes, have a good night.

56
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.473
- It's not that way.
- I see.

57
00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.841
- It's not that way either.
- I see.

58
00:06:42.223 --> 00:06:44.300
- It's a red light!
- I see.

59
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.459
Yoon So So. What does "So So" mean?

60
00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:03.199
It's green light.

61
00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:11.173
Would you like to go to the Seine?
The views are beautiful.

62
00:07:11.735 --> 00:07:13.639
Have you seen "The Lovers on the Bridge?"

63
00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.074
Would you like to go?

64
00:07:15.074 --> 00:07:17.221
- Right now?
- Yes.

65
00:07:17.221 --> 00:07:19.935
- Just the two of us?
- Yes.

66
00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:31.663
I'll see you at the airport
tomorrow. I'll wait for you.

67
00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:39.384
Yes, we shall go.

68
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.670
I mean, let's go.

69
00:07:44.262 --> 00:07:45.942
It's this way.

70
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.815
I see.

71
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.382
<i>An unfamiliar place, an unfamiliar
woman, and an unfamiliar proposal.</i>

72
00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:59.324
<i>A departure is given to me
on this vacation.</i>

73
00:08:00.841 --> 00:08:02.934
You can give me 30 euros.

74
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.084
Pardon? You want my money?

75
00:08:07.084 --> 00:08:10.144
There's an extra charge for night tours.

76
00:08:10.144 --> 00:08:12.396
You can give it to me
right now or tomorrow.

77
00:08:12.396 --> 00:08:16.038
- Are you saying...
- In Korean currency, 39,000 won.

78
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:28.500
Thank you.

79
00:08:35.668 --> 00:08:37.797
There were only two bridges
over the Seine

80
00:08:37.797 --> 00:08:39.926
until the middle of the 16th century.

81
00:08:39.926 --> 00:08:44.399
The bridges were too old and crowded,
so they built Pont Neuf.

82
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.019
In French, "Pont" means bridge,
and "Neuf" means new.

83
00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:50.496
It means "new bridge."

84
00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:53.037
But now, it's the oldest bridge in Paris.

85
00:08:53.037 --> 00:08:55.317
- It's right here, isn't it?
- Pardon?

86
00:08:55.317 --> 00:08:58.642
The place where the couple
in "The Lovers on the Bridge" stood.

87
00:08:58.642 --> 00:09:01.025
Yes, this is the place.

88
00:09:01.962 --> 00:09:03.847
Wow...

89
00:09:05.047 --> 00:09:06.666
I feel lonely.

90
00:09:08.404 --> 00:09:11.520
I've never heard anyone say that here.

91
00:09:12.197 --> 00:09:14.871
People normally say it's beautiful.

92
00:09:15.292 --> 00:09:17.481
It's a sad movie.

93
00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:20.114
The man was a homeless addict

94
00:09:20.114 --> 00:09:23.863
and the woman was
a painter who went blind.

95
00:09:25.538 --> 00:09:30.008
That's true. And then they loved,
beyond what they could manage.

96
00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:33.851
Who loves only as much
as they can manage?

97
00:09:35.147 --> 00:09:36.556
That's true.

98
00:09:37.339 --> 00:09:41.480
We all start, not realizing
that it'll end tragically.

99
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:46.524
Do you remember
the last line in the movie?

100
00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:51.700
"No one ever taught me
how to part with someone."

101
00:09:55.546 --> 00:09:57.251
<i>It's easy to talk to her.</i>

102
00:09:57.251 --> 00:09:59.389
<i>I want to talk with her all night.</i>

103
00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.304
Talk to me.

104
00:10:10.032 --> 00:10:11.782
I said, talk to me!

105
00:10:15.398 --> 00:10:18.245
- Would you like to go down to the river?
- Yes.

106
00:10:24.943 --> 00:10:29.123
The Seine passes through Paris
and leaves through the English Channel.

107
00:10:29.123 --> 00:10:31.690
It's 776 kilometers long

108
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.565
with an average depth of 8 meters.

109
00:10:33.565 --> 00:10:36.431
There are 37 bridges in Paris.

110
00:10:36.431 --> 00:10:40.816
It's made so that all the channels
exit through the river.

111
00:10:40.816 --> 00:10:45.125
All visitors who come to Paris
take a picture here.

112
00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:48.484
This is a photo point.
I'll take one for you.

113
00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:52.221
- I'm a little embarrassed.
- Stand over there.

114
00:10:52.221 --> 00:10:53.620
- Give it to me.
- Thank you.

115
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.471
Give me your phone.

116
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:57.812
Yes, it's right here.

117
00:11:01.407 --> 00:11:04.182
How... Here we go. Ready?

118
00:11:05.014 --> 00:11:07.134
You don't normally pose like that.

119
00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:08.453
You're right.

120
00:11:14.616 --> 00:11:17.671
But... why do you pose like that?

121
00:11:17.671 --> 00:11:18.999
I'm sorry.

122
00:11:21.285 --> 00:11:23.686
Just smile like before. It's much better.

123
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.558
Why aren't you going home?

124
00:13:09.558 --> 00:13:12.264
Team Leader,
I still have work left to do.

125
00:13:12.264 --> 00:13:14.948
Hey, your vacation starts tomorrow.

126
00:13:14.948 --> 00:13:16.774
Go home early.

127
00:13:18.717 --> 00:13:20.708
Sweet, I'm out of here.

128
00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:26.775
He's smart, mannerly, and rich.
He drives me crazy.

129
00:13:26.775 --> 00:13:29.614
- Even his shadow looks good.
- Is he smart?

130
00:13:29.614 --> 00:13:31.062
He failed to become a doctor.

131
00:13:31.062 --> 00:13:35.716
No. His father is a hospital director.
He was forced to go to medical school

132
00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:39.038
but decided to drop out last minute
to become a designer.

133
00:13:39.038 --> 00:13:41.836
- The hospital is huge.
- Really?

134
00:13:42.859 --> 00:13:46.465
- Hey, do you know what we call him?
- What?

135
00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:49.611
A man who has
nothing to do with our lives.

136
00:13:49.611 --> 00:13:50.841
Later.

137
00:14:15.655 --> 00:14:18.323
There are a lot of compounds
of calcium in the water in France.

138
00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:20.246
Pardon?

139
00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:23.432
It's harmful to your skin.

140
00:14:25.107 --> 00:14:26.418
I see.

141
00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:32.530
Take these. It's a vacation gift from me.

142
00:14:47.798 --> 00:14:49.129
Nice.

143
00:15:07.972 --> 00:15:09.626
Hey.

144
00:15:10.538 --> 00:15:12.120
You startled me.

145
00:15:12.794 --> 00:15:14.735
- Hey.
- What?

146
00:15:14.735 --> 00:15:17.035
Take that off.

147
00:15:17.035 --> 00:15:18.701
I'm almost finished.

148
00:15:18.701 --> 00:15:20.674
Geez, seriously.

149
00:15:21.243 --> 00:15:23.964
Do you know how I knew
that man is having an affair?

150
00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:26.655
- Does that even work?
- Of course.

151
00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:29.735
You know when we were
having dinner earlier today?

152
00:15:29.735 --> 00:15:34.860
I'm sorry. It's difficult
to call you because of work.

153
00:15:35.462 --> 00:15:36.870
Yeah.

154
00:15:37.638 --> 00:15:42.519
I got it. But you're the only one
who understands me, Honey.

155
00:15:43.613 --> 00:15:46.424
What? A video call?

156
00:15:48.778 --> 00:15:51.019
It's not a good time right now.

157
00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:52.287
Yeah.

158
00:15:54.249 --> 00:15:57.115
I know. I love you too. Kisses.

159
00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:08.046
Isn't it unbelievable?
Do you know what he did afterward?

160
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.187
He's such a jerk.

161
00:16:21.187 --> 00:16:23.501
You know the
young girl he came with?

162
00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:25.158
Did you see her makeup?

163
00:16:25.158 --> 00:16:28.217
Her style is totally absurd.
How can she be so tacky?

164
00:16:28.217 --> 00:16:31.581
- Is this for every other day?
- No, every day.

165
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:34.716
And you know the man
who calls everyone "Big Sis"?

166
00:16:34.716 --> 00:16:37.961
He's so uneducated. It annoys me.

167
00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:40.408
- Would you like some wine?
- No, a beer.

168
00:16:40.408 --> 00:16:43.943
And the man who came alone is weird too.

169
00:16:43.943 --> 00:16:46.619
Why did he go on a package
vacation by himself?

170
00:16:46.619 --> 00:16:49.546
- How much is the beer?
- Is he a pervert?

171
00:16:49.546 --> 00:16:52.269
- Hey, that doesn't mean he's a pervert.
- It's true.

172
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:54.524
He should have friends
if he doesn't have a girlfriend.

173
00:16:54.524 --> 00:16:58.482
- How much is eight euros?
- Let's see, 8,432...

174
00:16:58.482 --> 00:17:00.780
- I don't know.
- It's expensive, right?

175
00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.167
Did you see that woman take her medicine?

176
00:17:31.145 --> 00:17:33.359
I'm 100 percent sure she has depression.

177
00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:37.464
That lady has no expression on her face
and looks totally down.

178
00:17:37.464 --> 00:17:42.731
I'm not surprised. If my husband
were uneducated, I'd be depressed too.

179
00:17:44.088 --> 00:17:46.932
Why do you keep talking
about other people?

180
00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:49.432
Can't we talk about us instead?

181
00:17:54.144 --> 00:17:56.576
- Let's talk.
- About what?

182
00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.932
Let's talk about us.

183
00:18:02.265 --> 00:18:04.547
Sit down. You said you wanted to talk.

184
00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:07.400
- Aren't you drinking?
- No.

185
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.647
- You said you wanted beer.
- I'm not drinking.

186
00:18:09.647 --> 00:18:12.271
Why did you change your mind?
I'll go out and buy some.

187
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:14.872
Forget it. Let's talk about us.

188
00:18:14.872 --> 00:18:17.384
We don't need to talk.
I'll buy some beer.

189
00:18:37.047 --> 00:18:40.768
- When will you fix your habit?
- Habits can't be fixed.

190
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.938
Let's just stay in
and drink the hotel's beer.

191
00:18:44.938 --> 00:18:47.984
It's too expensive. Let's drink
hotel beer when we're successful.

192
00:18:47.984 --> 00:18:52.374
- But it's bothersome.
- It's better than paying too much money.

193
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.534
There are times when the mood
is more important than money.

194
00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:59.364
Hey, what mood do we need
to be in to drink beer? I'll be back.

195
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.876
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

196
00:19:34.498 --> 00:19:35.915
Yesterday...

197
00:19:37.952 --> 00:19:41.973
We tried on that and that.

198
00:20:09.494 --> 00:20:12.022
You came here with
your girlfriend, didn't you?

199
00:20:12.022 --> 00:20:15.561
Yes, do you remember the ones
she tried on but didn't buy?

200
00:20:15.561 --> 00:20:18.084
Yes, she said they were too racy.

201
00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:20.529
Yes.

202
00:20:21.229 --> 00:20:22.692
Pardon?

203
00:20:23.547 --> 00:20:26.673
I thought they were nice. Are they racy?

204
00:20:27.366 --> 00:20:31.585
They feature a sexy side
rather than function

205
00:20:31.585 --> 00:20:33.522
so it can be considered racy.

206
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:36.265
I see.

207
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.354
Would you like to buy them?

208
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:42.385

What?

217

Hello, Chief Yoo. It's me.

218
00:23:58.538 --> 00:24:01.346
Hey, aren't you coming to work?

219
00:24:01.346 --> 00:24:03.539
I'm on vacation starting today.

220
00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:06.844
Yeah, that's right. It's your vacation.

221
00:24:06.844 --> 00:24:08.527
When are you coming to work?

222
00:24:08.527 --> 00:24:12.923
- In 10 days.
- 10 days? Why?

223
00:24:12.923 --> 00:24:15.392
My vacation is 10 days.

224
00:24:16.996 --> 00:24:21.093
I know you're on vacation,
but are you actually taking it?

225
00:24:21.634 --> 00:24:23.728
I'm in France right now.

226
00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:26.461
I see. France?

227
00:24:26.461 --> 00:24:28.393
The French village in Gapyeong?

228
00:24:28.393 --> 00:24:30.650
No, I arrived in Paris yesterday.

229
00:24:31.508 --> 00:24:36.836
A new employee is using all his
vacation days for France? Paris?

230
00:24:36.836 --> 00:24:40.556
How are you so brave? Are you on drugs?

231
00:24:40.556 --> 00:24:43.803
- I'm not.
- Then are you crazy?

232
00:24:43.803 --> 00:24:48.346
We're all going crazy over next year's
sales report. Are you screwing us over?

233
00:24:50.727 --> 00:24:55.085
- You approved my vacation.
- I did.

234
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.132
But Deputy Oh is here for her vacation.

235
00:24:59.132 --> 00:25:01.220
Do you think life is a joke?

236
00:25:01.621 --> 00:25:04.609
Did Deputy Oh... go to work?

<i>Of course, you punk!</i>

00:25:18.596 --> 00:25:20.480
The company's in trouble because of you.

240
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.739
- It wasn't because of me.
- I'm sorry.

241
00:25:23.739 --> 00:25:25.983
It's true that it was
the company's fault.

242
00:25:25.983 --> 00:25:28.210
Although, it's not certain.

243
00:25:29.116 --> 00:25:32.503
- You know what I mean.
- I don't.

244
00:25:32.503 --> 00:25:35.101
I don't know why this
needs to be explained.

245
00:25:35.101 --> 00:25:37.470
We agreed to go on vacation
starting tomorrow.

246
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.614
Stop acting like a child.

247
00:25:39.614 --> 00:25:41.826
It was the company's fault,
but you exposed it.

248
00:25:41.826 --> 00:25:45.428
The problem itself isn't a problem,
but exposing is?

249
00:25:45.428 --> 00:25:49.912
You'll be fired if you make one mistake.
Do you really want to take time off?

250
00:25:49.912 --> 00:25:52.022
Then what am I supposed to do?

251
00:25:52.713 --> 00:25:56.365
Should I just go to work?
"I canceled my vacation so I can work."

252
00:25:56.365 --> 00:25:59.102
- Should I suck up?
- Don't act like you're strong.

253
00:25:59.102 --> 00:26:02.000
You want to avoid this problem
by going on vacation.

254
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.567
If you run away, will it change anything?

255
00:26:04.567 --> 00:26:06.715
Am I not allowed to run away?

256
00:26:06.715 --> 00:26:11.128
Can't I take some time off
to think about what I should do?

257

<i>The company told us to think
for ourselves while we worked</i>

258

<i>I felt like I wouldn't lose

even if they forced us to go on vacation.</i>

261
00:26:31.144 --> 00:26:34.484
You take all your vacation days,

I'm not sure.

281
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.230
Deputy Oh. Our ace, Deputy Oh.

282
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.459
Yes?

283
00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:48.557
How does the company operate?

284
00:28:48.557 --> 00:28:50.818
It operates with two words.

285

- What do I say?
- "Do well."

286

He wouldn't understand.

287
00:28:59.127 --> 00:29:01.144
What do I say?

288
00:29:01.144 --> 00:29:03.748
- "Do well."
- What should you hear?

289
00:29:03.748 --> 00:29:07.298
- "Good job."
- That's right.

290
00:29:07.298 --> 00:29:10.641
Do well. You just have to do a good job.

291
00:29:10.641 --> 00:29:13.727
That's how companies are.
You don't need to know anything else.

Yes, we graduated in the same year.

00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:45.477
Who else would come here
to catch you? Why are you asking?

317
00:31:45.949 --> 00:31:49.698
I'm going crazy. How did he
find out I work here?

318
00:31:49.698 --> 00:31:50.901
What did you say?

319
00:31:50.901 --> 00:31:54.968
I sweet-talked him to get him to leave.

320
00:31:54.968 --> 00:31:58.132
I understand your situation,
but I can't do anything.

321
00:31:58.132 --> 00:32:02.545
Her whereabouts and phone
number are personal information.

322
00:32:02.545 --> 00:32:05.644
If I expose her personal information...

323
00:32:05.644 --> 00:32:08.490
- I'll get arrested.
- So you can't tell me?

324
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.811
Well, that's the law, you know.

325
00:32:13.513 --> 00:32:17.006
Then, I guess one of us
will end up in prison.

326
00:32:17.642 --> 00:32:20.680
Whether it's you, who exposed
personal information...

327
00:32:23.113 --> 00:32:25.054
or me, who busted this place.

328
00:32:25.054 --> 00:32:27.727
He's not the type to listen.

329
00:32:28.442 --> 00:32:30.321
How did he know our office location?

330
00:32:30.321 --> 00:32:34.017
Who was it?
That friend that you live with.

331
00:32:34.017 --> 00:32:38.188
Was it "Alkay?" "Aljazirah?"

332
00:32:38.188 --> 00:32:42.421
- Algérie?
- Yeah, that's right. Algérie.

333
00:32:42.421 --> 00:32:47.208
I can't seem to remember
her name no matter how hard I try.

334
00:32:47.208 --> 00:32:49.026
Did Algérie tell him?

335
00:32:49.026 --> 00:32:52.823
It seems like she passed him over to me
when he went crazy at your place.

336
00:32:52.823 --> 00:32:56.913
Boss, you know my situation, right?
I can't get caught right now.

337
00:32:56.913 --> 00:32:58.374
I didn't do anything wrong.

338
00:32:58.374 --> 00:33:01.511
So So, So So. You stole money.

339
00:33:01.511 --> 00:33:02.791
Boss!

340
00:33:03.434 --> 00:33:06.632
- He just left to catch you.
- He's coming here?

341
00:33:06.632 --> 00:33:08.287
Did you tell him I'm here?

342
00:33:08.287 --> 00:33:11.652
So So, of course not.

343
00:33:14.026 --> 00:33:15.950
- Hey, look here.
- Geez.

344
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.901
We have multiple guides here.
You won't be able to find her.

345
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:23.594
Yes, Paris is a big city.

346
00:33:23.594 --> 00:33:27.607
But the tourist attractions are limited.

347
00:33:27.607 --> 00:33:29.458
Where else would a guide go?

348
00:33:34.234 --> 00:33:38.950
Geez, that young punk.
How dare he pat me like that?

349
00:33:39.593 --> 00:33:40.938
He's smart, though.

350
00:33:40.938 --> 00:33:43.247
How can you let him take
a picture of the schedule?

351
00:33:43.247 --> 00:33:48.753
As your boss,
and your much older "brother"

352
00:33:48.753 --> 00:33:52.554
let me give you a warning.
Just turn yourself in.

353
00:33:53.205 --> 00:33:56.548
You won't solve this problem
by running away.

354
00:33:56.548 --> 00:33:59.450
I'm not running away.
I'm just avoiding it.

355
00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:05.224
Why don't you stop writing a drama,
and live a reasonable life, So So?

356
00:34:05.224 --> 00:34:08.965
It's almost over.
I just need six more months.

357
00:34:09.976 --> 00:34:11.291
I'm hanging up.

358
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:16.438
Did you sleep well?
Did you have breakfast?

359
00:34:16.438 --> 00:34:19.005
- Why are the rooms so cold?
- Was it cold?

360
00:34:19.005 --> 00:34:21.101
How is this a five star hotel?

361
00:34:42.916 --> 00:34:45.067
Why aren't they coming down?

362
00:34:45.067 --> 00:34:47.501
It's not 8 o'clock yet.

363
00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:54.385
Why is that poop girl late again?

364
00:35:03.076 --> 00:35:04.835
We're late.

365
00:35:06.018 --> 00:35:09.280
- I'm almost done.
- Stop putting that on.

366
00:35:10.255 --> 00:35:13.436
If men don't take care of
their skin at my age, it's all over.

367
00:35:13.436 --> 00:35:16.262
Did that woman tell you
to take care of your skin?

368
00:35:18.623 --> 00:35:23.465
I'm not... jealous, as if I'm a child.

369
00:35:29.166 --> 00:35:32.599
- Big Sis Guide!
- I wish you wouldn't call her Big Sis.

370
00:35:32.599 --> 00:35:35.567
Weren't we supposed to be here
by 8 a.m.? Call their room!

371
00:35:36.202 --> 00:35:39.344
They're only late by one minute.
Let's wait a little bit longer.

372
00:35:39.344 --> 00:35:41.913
Whether it's one minute
or an hour, they're still late!

373
00:35:41.913 --> 00:35:45.938
They should have manners if they're
in a group. We waited since 7:30 a.m.!

374
00:35:45.938 --> 00:35:47.759
We're all waiting!

375
00:35:47.759 --> 00:35:50.597
- We're fine with it.
- What are you talking about?

376
00:35:50.597 --> 00:35:53.248
You're being too much, mister.

377
00:35:54.514 --> 00:35:58.125
- They're coming.
- I'm sorry.

378
00:35:58.125 --> 00:36:00.903
Pass me your key.
I'll help you check out.

379
00:36:02.012 --> 00:36:05.260
I left it in my room... Just kidding.

380
00:36:10.456 --> 00:36:13.894
We're in a group.
You shouldn't be late for no reason.

381
00:36:13.894 --> 00:36:16.818
- I'm sorry.
- We've been waiting since 7:00 a.m.!

382
00:36:16.818 --> 00:36:18.550
7:30 a.m.

383
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.201
Geez, I'm sorry, sir.

384
00:36:22.617 --> 00:36:24.934
By the way, did you...

385
00:36:24.934 --> 00:36:27.347
- buy this yourself?
- Why?

386
00:36:27.347 --> 00:36:31.070
I wanted to buy this so badly,
but it was too expensive.

387
00:36:31.954 --> 00:36:35.902
It it expensive? This?
My kid bought it for me.

388
00:36:35.902 --> 00:36:38.692
Wow, what a good son.

389
00:36:38.692 --> 00:36:41.436
- This is expensive.
- It was our daughter.

390
00:36:41.436 --> 00:36:43.585
Daughters are the best.
They are, indeed.

391
00:36:43.585 --> 00:36:46.907
These cost hundreds, even on sale.

392
00:36:46.907 --> 00:36:49.322
This one was from my son.

393
00:36:49.322 --> 00:36:55.331
Which one? Wow, this is
what you wear to the Himalayas.

394
00:36:56.632 --> 00:36:59.902
Why did they buy such
expensive clothes for me?

395
00:37:00.543 --> 00:37:05.152
We're going to Montmartre today.
Even if we only climb one hill...

396
00:37:05.152 --> 00:37:08.690
you should wear something
like this. That's right!

397
00:37:09.465 --> 00:37:11.443
Let's get on the bus.

398
00:37:11.443 --> 00:37:15.733
I'm sorry for being late, everyone.
As a token of my apology

399
00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:18.637
I'll buy everyone some drinks.

400
00:37:18.637 --> 00:37:21.152
Let's hurry!

401
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:27.268
Those were so shabby.
No one wears those anymore.

402
00:37:27.268 --> 00:37:30.106
In business, compliments are necessary.

403
00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:33.858
That's okay. It's fine the way it is.

404
00:37:33.858 --> 00:37:36.514
That young lad knows
what he's talking about.

405
00:37:39.856 --> 00:37:42.492
Did you see that?
The way he flatters people.

406
00:37:42.492 --> 00:37:44.105
That's how he gets women.

407
00:37:44.105 --> 00:37:47.028
You said you hated the sight of him,
but you're watching him carefully.

408
00:37:47.028 --> 00:37:49.800
The things we hate
are much easier to see.

409
00:37:55.585 --> 00:37:59.175
I'm going crazy.
How did he know I work here?

410
00:37:59.175 --> 00:38:02.027
He's not the type to listen.

411
00:38:13.532 --> 00:38:15.902
Today, we'll visit Montmartre

412
00:38:15.902 --> 00:38:18.789
have lunch, visit Auvers-sur-Oise

413
00:38:18.789 --> 00:38:21.586
and arrive at
Mont Saint-Michel by evening.

414
00:38:21.586 --> 00:38:26.320
We'll come back to Paris on the last day
to do everything we missed yesterday.

415
00:38:39.588 --> 00:38:43.150
Do you see the Eiffel Tower over there?

416
00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:03.523
It's a world-famous
tourist attraction now

417
00:39:03.523 --> 00:39:05.927
but it was criticized at first.

418
00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:09.539
Artists criticized that scraps of metal

419
00:39:09.539 --> 00:39:12.668
were coming in to invade beautiful Paris.

420
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:18.945
Maupassant, who wrote
"Une Vie," strongly opposed.

421
00:39:18.945 --> 00:39:22.079
But he later became a regular customer
at the restaurant at the Eiffel Tower.

422
00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:24.302
People asked him this question.

423
00:39:24.302 --> 00:39:27.701
"Why do you come here
after you opposed it so strongly?"

424
00:39:33.152 --> 00:39:35.096
Maupassant said this.

425
00:39:35.096 --> 00:39:38.503
"This is the only place
where I can't see the Eiffel Tower."

426
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.489
People normally laugh when I say this.

427
00:39:48.612 --> 00:39:53.181
But the Eiffel Tower has become
the top symbol of Paris.

428
00:40:14.027 --> 00:40:17.998
Why did you want to meet here?
People will be suspicious.

429
00:40:18.675 --> 00:40:20.847
I have a question.

430
00:40:22.025 --> 00:40:23.829
What do you think about me?

431
00:40:24.519 --> 00:40:26.626
What are you saying all of a sudden?

432
00:40:27.233 --> 00:40:28.713
Answer me.

433
00:40:29.442 --> 00:40:31.143
What do you think of me?

434
00:40:31.143 --> 00:40:34.911
What else? I think you're sexy.

435
00:40:35.445 --> 00:40:37.545
That's not what I mean.

436
00:40:37.545 --> 00:40:40.914
Am I... a trustworthy person?

437
00:40:40.914 --> 00:40:43.795
You're so trustworthy, that you're sexy.

438
00:40:44.639 --> 00:40:48.135
Am I... an upright person?

439
00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:51.916
Is something... the matter?

440
00:40:58.088 --> 00:41:03.414
Yeah. You're very upright,
to the point of being trustworthy.

441
00:41:03.414 --> 00:41:07.121
Will you... stay by my side
until the end?

442
00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:09.030
What's the matter?

443
00:41:15.358 --> 00:41:16.751
Fine.

444
00:41:18.938 --> 00:41:22.021
I'm on your side until the end.

445
00:41:25.751 --> 00:41:27.744
I think I made a mistake.

446
00:41:27.744 --> 00:41:31.202
I mean, I made a mistake.

447
00:41:32.255 --> 00:41:37.974
I was suspicious, so I pulled a report.
The company is doing strange things.

448
00:41:45.391 --> 00:41:48.197
You should get off. We're here.

449
00:42:00.972 --> 00:42:02.320
This way.

450
00:42:21.824 --> 00:42:23.309
Wow.

451
00:42:27.353 --> 00:42:30.041
This way.

452
00:42:30.041 --> 00:42:32.498
This is similar to the cable cars
at Namsan Tower.

453
00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:40.719
<i>Montmartre used to be
a village outside of Paris</i>

454
00:42:40.719 --> 00:42:43.686
<i>and was incorporated
into Paris in the 1870s.</i>

455
00:42:43.686 --> 00:42:47.931
<i>After the village became established,
poor people gathered here</i>

456
00:42:47.931 --> 00:42:49.710
<i>and flourished after that.</i>

457
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:53.119
<i>Places such as Moulin Rouge and
Moulin de la Galette were established</i>

458
00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:56.574
<i>and such cabarets
are continuing to keep it alive.</i>

459
00:42:56.574 --> 00:43:01.646
<i>In the 19th century, Manet, Monet,
Gogh, Cézanne, and Picasso</i>

460
00:43:01.646 --> 00:43:05.215
<i>gathered here as poor artists
to paint and sell their art</i>

461
00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:07.222
<i>and kept this place alive.</i>

462
00:43:07.222 --> 00:43:11.610
<i>Their juniors are still painting here,
so this place hasn't changed over time</i>

463
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.760
<i>and became the street of art.</i>

464
00:43:14.295 --> 00:43:17.672
This is a Catholic church
named Sacré-Coeur.

465
00:43:17.672 --> 00:43:22.579
It was built to commemorate those
who were sacrificed in the Paris Commune.

466
00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:25.447
It looks different from other
Catholic churches, don't you think?

467
00:43:25.447 --> 00:43:31.369
It features the Byzantine art taken from
Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey.

468
00:43:32.286 --> 00:43:34.391
Let's go that way.

469
00:43:36.713 --> 00:43:39.820
This is a free observatory
where you can see all of Paris.

470
00:43:40.422 --> 00:43:43.085
This looks like the view
from Namsan Tower.

471
00:43:43.085 --> 00:43:44.436
Right?

472
00:43:44.436 --> 00:43:48.554
We need to sit here and eat
some pork belly with soju.

473
00:43:48.554 --> 00:43:50.552
Too bad.

474
00:43:50.552 --> 00:43:54.492
We'll have some free time
and meet here in one hour.

475
00:43:54.492 --> 00:43:57.824
Be careful of your passports,
wallets, phones, and cameras!

476
00:43:57.824 --> 00:44:00.570
If salespeople talk to you,
don't answer them.

477
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.755
Let's meet here in one hour.

478
00:44:02.755 --> 00:44:04.722
- Yes.
- Yes.

479
00:44:10.469 --> 00:44:11.849
Aren't you going?

480
00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:14.161
Is there a place with Wi-Fi here?

481
00:44:14.161 --> 00:44:18.670
The cafes should have Wi-Fi.
Are you going to work?

482
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.320
- Yes.
- You're on vacation, though.

483
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.974
You need to be brave to rest. If not,
you'll ruin your work and vacation.

484
00:44:26.492 --> 00:44:30.289
<i>The five eagle brothers didn't die
because they didn't know that.</i>

485
00:44:31.396 --> 00:44:33.927
I need to urgently
take care of something.

486
00:44:33.927 --> 00:44:37.806
- Please come back in time.
- Yes, thank you.

487
00:44:47.157 --> 00:44:50.914
Please sketch from my waist up.

488
00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.766
- Okay?
- Okay.

489
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.867
Why are you doing something
you can do in Korea?

490
00:44:57.867 --> 00:45:01.070
- He's a French artist.
- All drawings are the same.

491
00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:04.476
Let's go and eat some delicious food.

492
00:45:04.476 --> 00:45:07.739
- Please stop.
- What did I do?

493
00:45:07.739 --> 00:45:10.568
I want to be portrayed beautifully.

494
00:45:10.568 --> 00:45:12.838
Why are you greedy
for beauty at your age?

495
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:20.065
Am I not allowed to be greedy?

496
00:45:20.065 --> 00:45:22.914
I was never greedy before
in my entire life.

497
00:45:25.135 --> 00:45:26.590
Geez.

498
00:45:30.858 --> 00:45:32.554
Gosh, why is it raining?

499
00:45:32.554 --> 00:45:35.483
I know, right? It's scattered too.

500
00:45:35.483 --> 00:45:38.422
Wouldn't it be nice to get married here?

501
00:45:38.422 --> 00:45:39.998
We can have the ceremony there

502
00:45:39.998 --> 00:45:41.900
and our guests can
drink tea at the cafes.

503
00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.804
Hey, that's too expensive. It'll cost
one million won to rent one cafe.

504
00:45:45.804 --> 00:45:49.474
Two, four, six, eight.
How many are there?

505
00:45:49.474 --> 00:45:52.193
- Forget it.
- What is it this time?

506
00:45:52.193 --> 00:45:55.684
We can make more money
and have a beautiful wedding.

507
00:45:55.684 --> 00:45:58.108
Forget it. Let's go to a coffee shop.

508
00:45:58.108 --> 00:46:00.715
Why? Do you need to poop again?

509
00:46:00.715 --> 00:46:03.420
- Yeah.
- Did you fail to go again?

510
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.282
I want to die.

511
00:46:08.628 --> 00:46:11.208
I miss you too.

512
00:46:11.208 --> 00:46:13.751
You know I miss you a lot.

513
00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:20.619
Well, I can't do a video call.

514
00:46:20.619 --> 00:46:24.501
That's not it. I'm with some
other people, so it's noisy.

515
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:29.242
Yeah, of course.
I've been thinking about you all day.

516
00:46:29.242 --> 00:46:31.938
I love you too.

517
00:46:35.844 --> 00:46:37.525
It's raining all of a sudden.

518
00:46:37.525 --> 00:46:40.610
You could die for her, huh?

519
00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:43.829
Hey, love is a business too.

520
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:45.088
Gosh.

521
00:46:47.059 --> 00:46:51.065
Senior Chief, whom I love. Let me
use your card to go shopping.

522
00:46:51.065 --> 00:46:53.722
Hey, what do you have to buy?

523
00:46:55.007 --> 00:46:58.708
Geez, you should buy things. Here.

524
00:46:58.708 --> 00:47:00.864
- Buy whatever you want.
- Okay.

525
00:47:00.864 --> 00:47:02.608
I love you.

526
00:48:12.244 --> 00:48:14.045
You're Korean, aren't you?

527
00:48:14.746 --> 00:48:17.494
Do you know this woman?

528
00:48:17.494 --> 00:48:19.563
She's a Korean tour guide.

529
00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:21.215
- I'm not sure.
- I don't know.

530
00:48:29.606 --> 00:48:34.505
You're Korean, aren't you?
Do you know her? She's a tour guide.

531
00:48:37.273 --> 00:48:38.505
Do you know her?

532
00:48:47.036 --> 00:48:51.001
I'm going crazy.
How did he find out I work here?

533
00:48:51.503 --> 00:48:56.032
Boss, you know my situation, right?
I can't get caught right now.

534
00:48:56.032 --> 00:48:58.110
I didn't do anything wrong.

535
00:48:59.414 --> 00:49:01.032
You know her, don't you?

536
00:49:01.032 --> 00:49:04.717
If you tell me where she is,
I'll compensate you.

537
00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.043
Yes?

538
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.905
I'm sorry.
(In Japanese)

539
00:49:24.139 --> 00:49:26.114
Thank you.

540
00:49:54.072 --> 00:49:57.213
- You're Korean, aren't you?
- Yes.

541
00:49:57.213 --> 00:49:59.257
Have you seen this woman before?

542
00:49:59.257 --> 00:50:00.668
Thank you.

543
00:50:28.909 --> 00:50:32.088
- Are you Korean, by any chance?
- Yes.

544
00:50:32.088 --> 00:50:35.023
Have you seen this woman before?

545
00:50:35.023 --> 00:50:37.744
She's a Korean tour guide.

546
00:50:37.744 --> 00:50:39.284
I haven't.

547
00:51:07.083 --> 00:51:08.503
Guide Yoon!

548
00:51:14.168 --> 00:51:15.434
Guide Yoon!

549
00:51:21.186 --> 00:51:23.097
Wait. Wait.

550
00:51:23.097 --> 00:51:25.480
What are you doing?

551
00:51:31.905 --> 00:51:34.003
- Wait. Wait.
- Yes.

552
00:51:34.003 --> 00:51:35.659
Wait a minute.

553
00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:37.592
I'm sorry. Hold on.

554
00:51:41.186 --> 00:51:43.188
Wait, I'm begging you.

555
00:51:49.663 --> 00:51:53.592
<i>I didn't know my heart
could pound so hard.</i>

556
00:51:55.719 --> 00:51:57.186
He left.

557
00:52:02.777 --> 00:52:04.586
I noticed someone's been looking for you.

558
00:52:05.333 --> 00:52:07.007
I'm sorry if I startled you.

559
00:52:11.222 --> 00:52:14.971
Thank you. And sorry about that.

560
00:52:14.971 --> 00:52:16.485
Let's meet with the others.

561
00:52:25.994 --> 00:52:28.476
Geez, I'm sorry.

562
00:52:29.699 --> 00:52:32.201
But why isn't the guide here?

563
00:52:32.201 --> 00:52:33.869
I'm sure she'll be here.

564
00:52:33.869 --> 00:52:37.614
Did she run off because
we didn't tip her?

565
00:52:37.614 --> 00:52:40.820
- I hear about it on the news.
- Hey.

566
00:52:41.769 --> 00:52:43.228
That's enough.

567
00:52:44.413 --> 00:52:47.282
Why do you always say that to me?

568
00:52:47.282 --> 00:52:49.646
What did I do? Geez.

569
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:02.844
Thank you.

570
00:53:06.594 --> 00:53:08.150
Excuse me.

571
00:53:10.273 --> 00:53:12.217
You're not Korean.

572
00:53:12.217 --> 00:53:15.898
- Goodbye. (In Japanese)
- Goodbye.

573
00:53:34.548 --> 00:53:37.789
<i>Please meet me in front of
the rail car. I'm sorry.</i>

574
00:53:50.106 --> 00:53:51.628
This way!

575
00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:53.903
Let's get in. Yes.

576
00:53:53.903 --> 00:53:55.605
Please hurry.

577
00:53:56.974 --> 00:53:58.791
Let's get in.

578
00:53:58.791 --> 00:54:00.829
Please hurry.

579
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:03.257
I'm sorry. Please get in.

580
00:54:19.545 --> 00:54:20.981
Damn it.

581
00:54:24.655 --> 00:54:28.755
Did you have a good time? We'll have
lunch before we go to Auvers-sur-Oise.

582
00:54:28.755 --> 00:54:31.411
Huh? He's that Japanese man
we saw earlier.

583
00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:33.800
You're right.

584
00:54:36.304 --> 00:54:40.663
Yes, we'll go to Auvers-sur-Oise...

585
00:54:40.663 --> 00:54:42.547
I heard it's a grave of someone.

586
00:54:43.394 --> 00:54:46.443
Yes, at Auvers-sur-Oise...

587
00:54:46.443 --> 00:54:47.451
The thing is...

588
00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:50.175
It's the grave of an artist from
the Netherlands, Vincent van Gogh.

589
00:54:50.175 --> 00:54:52.856
Why was a man from
the Netherlands buried in France?

590
00:54:52.856 --> 00:54:56.873
Gogh worked at a company,
but I don't remember the name.

591
00:54:56.873 --> 00:55:00.222
He worked at Goupil Cies Gallery
in the The Hague.

592
00:55:00.222 --> 00:55:02.788
But he was assigned
to the branch in France.

593
00:55:02.788 --> 00:55:05.452
And then he gave up working there,
and became a painter.

594
00:55:05.452 --> 00:55:09.552
Geez, it's a tough world out there.
Why did he quit his job? How foolish.

595
00:55:09.552 --> 00:55:12.166
- Why are you getting mad at me?
- Why are we going to his grave?

596
00:55:12.166 --> 00:55:14.161
- So So.
- Yes?

597
00:55:14.161 --> 00:55:15.217
We're here.

598
00:55:15.217 --> 00:55:19.423
Yes, let's move quickly.

599
00:55:20.791 --> 00:55:22.550
Why?

600
00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:26.791
I'm sorry! We're late for lunch!
Please hurry!

601
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:28.226
Why?

602
00:55:28.226 --> 00:55:32.726
- Hurry! Please hurry!
- Where are we going, Big Sis Guide?

603
00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:56.900
I'm not running away.
I'm just avoiding him.

604
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:59.518
I'm sorry. Hold on.

605
00:57:03.588 --> 00:57:06.206
<i>In life, it's about
the direction, not speed.</i>

606
00:57:06.206 --> 00:57:10.192
<i>But there's never enough time
to make a decision.</i>

607
00:57:17.599 --> 00:57:20.762
- Geez.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

608
00:57:20.762 --> 00:57:23.715
I want to talk to your boss!
Call your boss!

609
00:57:24.628 --> 00:57:26.436
Wait!

610
00:57:36.514 --> 00:57:40.293
You're known for not knowing
what your job is and causing trouble.

611
00:57:40.293 --> 00:57:42.896
If you don't want to do it, quit.

612
00:57:54.547 --> 00:57:56.871
<i>I've seen that bus before.</i>

613
00:57:56.871 --> 00:57:59.599
Wait! You forgot me!

614
00:57:59.599 --> 00:58:02.856
I told you to stop! Hey!

615
00:58:02.856 --> 00:58:04.230
Hey!

616
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:06.862
Stop!

617
00:58:06.862 --> 00:58:09.744
Stop! You forgot me!

618
00:58:09.744 --> 00:58:11.777
Wait! Please!

619
00:58:11.777 --> 00:58:12.884
Wait!

620
00:58:12.884 --> 00:58:14.585
Please, step on it!

621
00:58:14.585 --> 00:58:16.719
- Hurry, hurry!
- What the heck?

622
00:58:16.719 --> 00:58:18.786
Is this the Han River?

623
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:26.251
- Wait!
- Damn it.

624
00:58:26.251 --> 00:58:28.266
Don't forget me!

625
00:58:28.581 --> 00:58:31.192
He's not Japanese. That bastard.

626
00:58:31.192 --> 00:58:32.869
Hey, you bastard!

627
00:58:34.753 --> 00:58:37.096
