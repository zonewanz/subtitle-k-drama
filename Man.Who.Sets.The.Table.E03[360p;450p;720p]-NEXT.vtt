00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.559
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.262
It smells so bad.

3
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.197
It's been over 10 days since he died.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.133
- Oh, my. 
- How did that happen?

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.734
His wife graduated their marriage,

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.404
- so he died alone. 
- Did he die alone?

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.539
He should've treated his wife better.

8
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.476
Oh, my.

9
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.318
Sir?

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.320
We're here.

11
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.833
You're late.

12
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.304
You drank a lot.

13
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.740
What happened?

14
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.643
Oh, my. Let me go. What are you doing?

15
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.244
What are you doing?

16
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.880
What are you doing? Have you gone mad?

17
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.382
Get away.

18
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.950
What's wrong with you?

19
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.053
You witch.

20
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.189
Do you think I'd let you go?

21
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.059
You'll always be my wife whether 
you're dead or alive.

22
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.995
Divorce? No way.

23
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.964
That will never happen.

24
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.185
What are you doing?

25
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.430
My friend Jong Gu...

26
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.666
Jong Gu died.

27
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.739
He had a stroke in the bathroom.

28
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.975
He bled a lot.

29
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.577
My poor friend.

30
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.548
He was living alone.

31
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.654
He was found 10 days after his death.

32
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.560
Honey,

33
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.364
do you want that to happen to me?

34
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.000
Do you really want to...

35
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.803
divorce or do that graduation thing...

36
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.007
and make me live alone?

37
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.912
I really don't want to be alone.

38
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.847
The children are all gone.

39
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.582
What will I do alone in this big house?

40
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.020
What will I do...

41
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.023
if I don't have you?

42
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.459
I can't live...

43
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.528
alone.

44
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.300
Tell me.

45
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.834
I'll do anything.

46
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.971
I'll do anything you ask for.

47
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.173
Tell me.

48
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.308
Please.

49
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.510
Let's stop doing this.

50
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.080
You're drunk. Go to sleep.

51
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.582
Answer me!

52
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.684
Tell me you'll stop doing this graduation thing.

53
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.485
Answer me right now.

54
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.155
You're trying to hold on to me saying you will treat me better,

55
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.857
but it's impossible for you to do that.

56
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.359
Do you know why?

57
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.061
You will never know...

58
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.196
why it was hard for me to live...

59
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.333
with you.

60
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.768
Young Hye.

61
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.939
Are you done talking?

62
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.845
When a man comforts you like this,

63
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.450
a woman should accept him back.

64
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.785
Why are you so stubborn?

65
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.688
Do you think you're perfect because I said I'll treat you better?

66
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.392
I wasn't going to tell you,

67
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.394
but I also have a lot of complaints about you.

68
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.364
Do you want me to list all of your faults?

69
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.904
I know...

70
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.540
that you are stupid.

71
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.378
Just obey me.

72
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.880
Do you know who...

73
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.183
will be more damaged if we part ways?

74
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.952
When a man has some money,

75
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.322
women stand in line to live with him...

76
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.059
even if he's old.

77
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.695
Hey.

78
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.197
You're going to turn 60 soon.

79
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.934
You already reached menopause. Who will treat you as a woman?

80
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.939
I'm still a man.

81
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.445
You're just...

82
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.947
a human.

83
00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.382
A neuter gender.

84
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.184
Okay?

85
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.454
Grandma, you're going to be in trouble.

86
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.325
Oh, my.

87
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.626
Oh, my.

88
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.395
Hey. You almost hit me.

89
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.997
You don't think I can hit you?

90
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.499
I always wanted to hit you whenever you ignored me...

91
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.368
while I was living with you.

92
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.869
What did you say?

93
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.441
Are you out of your mind? Okay.

94
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.076
Hit me.

95
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.812
Okay, hit me.

96
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.147
- Hit me. - Get away.

97
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.516
- Hit me. - Why are you doing this?

98
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.518
Just hit me.

99
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.553
- Move. - Hit me.

100
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.955
- Move away! - Why? Just hit me.

101
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.058
You don't even know how to hit me.

102
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.127
I'm telling you to hit me.

103
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.765
Wait a minute.

104
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.001
Oh, my.

105
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.144
I'm bleeding.

106
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.380
I can't believe you're doing this.

107
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.514
I'm asking you.

108
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.650
Let me be courteous when we're going to part ways.

109
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.952
Come here.

110
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.820
Follow me!

111
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.823
- What are you doing? - Come here.

112
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.725
- What are you doing? - Follow me!

113
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.960
What are you doing?

114
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.194
Come here.

115
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.564
- Follow me. - It hurts.

116
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.433
Let go of me if you want to talk.

117
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.501
Get in.

118
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.302
Where are we going at this hour?

119
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.005
Are you that mad to bury me under the ground or something?

120
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.574
Yes! I'm going to buy a shovel on my way. Get in.

121
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.576
Get in. This is an order!

122
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.745
Goodness.

123
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.749
This is your favorite dried yellow corvina. Eat up.

124
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.018
No, I won't.

125
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.388
Why are you trying to upset me?

126
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.756
Do you have to ask?

127
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.958
So Won is mad because of you.

128
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.194
You said your plan could help them reconcile,

129
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.495
but they're going to get divorced.

130
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.698
Your mother-in-law already made her decision.

131
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.700
How would I have known that in advance?

132
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.136
That woman should know she's lucky to be fed and have a roof over her.

133
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.640
Fine. Tell her to live without her husband.

134
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.743
Hey. I became a widow at the age of 28.

135
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.947
Goodness, men in Beolgyo recognized beauty when they saw one.

136
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.316
From gangsters to men who emptied the septic tank,

137
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.453
every man made a pass at me when I walked past them.

138
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.255
Do you know how humiliating that was?

139
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.513
What's Ru Ri doing? Why isn't she answering her phone?

140
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.014
Our family is such a mess now.

141
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.124
You're going back to your family whom you must have missed.

142
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.060
Why do you look like you're going to a slaughterhouse?

143
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.063
Right now, I feel like I've transformed into a cow.

144
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.199
I'm sorry, Manager Jung.

145
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.635
You have to take a disciplinary action because of me.

146
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.803
Exactly.

147
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.439
Do you know how much you disappointed me?

148
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.874
I'm really sorry.

149
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.810
How can you fall for such a loser like him even if you were desperate?

150
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.945
Raise your standards.

151
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.080
Manager Jung.

152
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.115
And work on your punches.

153
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.651
You only look intimidating with your height.

154
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.386
You couldn't even take down that witch.

155
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.262
Actually, today is the first day I let out my anger.

156
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.266
I always held back and let the others win.

157
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.269
I lost it today. I was furious.

158
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.137
Why do you live like such a pushover?

159
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.109
I wonder from which point my life started to head south.

160
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.279
But what's weird is that...

161
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.282
once things go sour, they keep going south.

162
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.518
Unfortunate things always happen to me.

163
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.922
I'm not brave either.

164
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.525
I don't believe in myself.

165
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.997
I'm not that competent either.

166
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.900
I'm so pathetic.

167
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.268
Have you just realized that?

168
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.239
How pathetic.

169
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.647
Where are you going? The airport is that way.

170
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.867
That's so intriguing!

171
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.716
He got out.

172
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.618
How did he get out?

173
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.253
Did you see that?

174
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.756
You look kind of lame right now.

175
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.860
But why did you bring me here? We were going to the airport.

176
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.296
I took pity on you.

177
00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.099
I wanted you to find some solutions for your life.

178
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.500
Solutions?

179
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.971
Solutions?

180
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.017
If you go in now, you can check in right away.

181
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.785
Be smart in Seoul.

182
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.521
Let me warn you.

183
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.224
Let's not meet ever again.

184
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.926
- I'm going. - Wait.

185
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.397
Tell me why you brought me to the magic show.

186
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.767
You said I can find some solutions for my life there.

187
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.402
What could that be?

188
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.405
Look at you. You really are pathetic, aren't you?

189
00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.543
Even after the show, you didn't feel or realize anything?

190
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.911
I thought it was fantastic.

191
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.681
It amazed me how he could do the trick in a blink of an eye.

192
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.649
Do you know what the most important part is...

193
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.851
when magicians do their tricks?

194
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.923
The magicians must believe in themselves.

195
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.526
"I can do it."

196
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.129
"No matter how hard it is, I can pull it off."

197
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.266
When you believe in yourself that you can actually do it,

198
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.669
your life will magically improve.

199
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.773
Go already.

200
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.509
I don't want to see you again after you miss your flight.

201
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.244
I'm leaving now.

202
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.147
Thank you, sir.

203
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.394
Stop disappointing me.

204
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.767
If you don't get this job, just get married to Myung Tae.

205
00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.271
My boyfriend told me...

206
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.174
that you had never had a boyfriend,

207
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.743
and that you clung onto him...

208
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.778
after he treated you nicely out of pity.

209
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.747
He played with you like a toy.

210
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.218
You were too pathetic that you couldn't tell love and pity apart.

211
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.922
"No matter how hard it is, I can pull it off."

212
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.758
The magicians must believe in themselves.

213
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.603
He's right. I can't just go back like this.

214
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.654
Where are we going?

215
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.723
Are we really going to a mountain?

216
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.124
Why? Are you scared?

217
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.392
No way.

218
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.628
Being buried in the mountain sounds like a better alternative...

219
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.730
than living with you.

220
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.538
Oh, my.

221
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.406
Don't drive like a lunatic.

222
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.909
You're not even good with directions.

223
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.411
Don't use your brain. Just do what I tell you to do.

224
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.013
Unbelievable.

225
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.501
Hey, Lee Ru Ri.

226
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.136
Hey, loser.

227
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.675
Why did you come so late?

228
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.510
I waited for you so long.

229
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.745
I went grocery shopping and had dinner.

230
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.014
But what's going on? Why are you here?

231
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.986
Let me stay at your place just for a week.

232
00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.387
Please let me stay.

233
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.990
What? Why should I?

234
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.024
Don't worry.

235
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.927
A week later, when I get the job as the club mate again,

236
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.863
I'll move out right away.

237
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.565
Have you gone mad? Why would I let a grown-up woman stay at my home?

238
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.000
You won't have to worry about that either.

239
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.636
I'll stay out of sight and just sleep at your place.

240
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.608
Besides, you're the safest guy I can think of.

241
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.877
Because of the aftereffect,

242
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.379
you're incapable...

243
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.481
Hey, don't you dare look down.

244
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.520
Then I will carry this bag since I'm your roommate now.

245
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.759
Why did you buy so many things?

246
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.895
I guess you knew I was waiting for you here.

247
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.133
Park the car over there. Slowly.

248
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.205
We're here. Get off the car.

249
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.274
Where on earth are we?

250
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.350
Why does it look so creepy?

251
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.263
The wind is getting chilly. Let's go back.

252
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.501
Unless you're seriously thinking of burying me, let's go.

253
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.670
Can't you...

254
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.772
recognize where we are?

255
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.743
I get that you are bad with directions.

256
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.845
You can't forget this place.

257
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.382
21, San Avenue.

258
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.252
Unit 203.

259
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.521
This is the place?

260
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.259
You must have forgotten everything...

261
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.595
including how we met...

262
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.998
and how we lived.

263
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.315
I ran into you by chance

264
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.285
And you stole my heart just like that

265
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.023
I saw your eyes by chance

266
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.760
They won my heart over

267
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.999
I have something to tell you

268
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:29.805
But why don't I have the courage?

269
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.012
I want to tell you, but I don't have the courage

270
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.348
My heart is just racing

271
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.586
I'm frustrated

272
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.791
Let the wind blow it away

273
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.394
Isn't he good looking? He's my brother's friend.

274
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.863
Shin Mo, I'm here.

275
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.399
Oh, you're here.

276
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.639
This is my friend, Hong Young Hye.

277
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.008
She's the most popular girl from my major. Isn't she pretty?

278
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.882
Let's go eat some bread together.

279
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.219
What?

280
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.123
It's fortunate that you like my daughter.

281
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.293
When should they get married?

282
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.129
The sooner the better.

283
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.165
What about you, Young Hye?

284
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.069
Father.

285
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.740
I will take Young Hye with me.

286
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.108
Let's go.

287
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.943
What are you doing?

288
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.179
How will you support her?

289
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.614
My daughter will marry an entertainer like you...

290
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.884
over my dead body.

291
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.319
Okay.

292
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.540
I will get a job and support her.

293
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.210
Where are you going?

294
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.578
Sit down right now!

295
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.655
Are you going to be okay?

296
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.890
The room is really small.

297
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.792
Let's start from my boarding house.

298
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.395
Do you regret it?

299
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.630
With you,

300
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.366
I will never regret.

301
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.138
I can't promise you anything else,

302
00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.640
except for one.

303
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.276
I won't make you cry.

304
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.056
Oh, my.

305
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.659
Nothing has changed.

306
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.962
We are the ones who have changed.

307
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.618
You have everything.

308
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.888
My mom will love these.

309
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.358
Why is your kitchen so amazing when you're living alone?

310
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.893
Don't touch that.

311
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.395
You're going to break them.

312
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.235
Roman prosciutto grilled beef sirloin.

313
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.404
These are all recipes.

314
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.407
Manager Jung, are you a chef?

315
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.476
I heard that you worked quite long at the resort.

316
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.880
What is your favorite food from the resort?

317
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.152
What was it?

318
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.453
Rigatoni pasta.

319
00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.855
That's really good.

320
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.625
- I developed that. - What?

321
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.093
Really?

322
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.229
You really are a professional.

323
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.736
Here, this is seafood risotto.

324
00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.439
- It's an honor to eat my food. - Thank you.

325
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.878
Are you going to throw that away?

326
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.316
You can throw it away right here.

327
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.218
This is for four people.

328
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.953
It's better than throwing it away.

329
00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.789
Your stomach is amazing.

330
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.825
Where should I sleep?

331
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.593
You're shameless.

332
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.062
You didn't even get on the plane.

333
00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:48.897
Where does your confidence come from?

334
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.699
You said it.

335
00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.869
"If you believe you'll be good, you'll become good at it."

336
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.572
From now on,

337
00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.240
I'm going to start trusting myself.

338
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.175
Like magic.

339
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.310
Like this.

340
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:02.611
Ru Ri, you can do it.

341
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:03.979
Let's go.

342
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.415
Do you see that?

343
00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.449
That is my room.

344
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.851
There's a guest room right next there.

345
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.886
Don't get confused and come into my room.

346
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.488
Be quiet and just sleep.

347
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.056
Wash the dishes cleanly.

348
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.190
Okay.

349
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.293
Good night.

350
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.333
Seriously?

351
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.135
She's deep in sleep.

352
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.571
She got confused and came into my room.

353
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.574
Hey.

354
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.075
Hey.

355
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.608
Hey, Ru Ri.

356
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.813
Is she sick?

357
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.550
Maybe she got bitten by a red ant.

358
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.653
Ru Ri, wake up.

359
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.525
This is serious. She's unconscious.

360
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.295
Let's go to the hospital. We have to go to the hospital.

361
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.665
Where are my car keys?

362
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.034
Where did I put them?

363
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.436
Who are you?

364
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.838
Where am I?

365
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.807
Oh, my.

366
00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.109
What happened?

367
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.713
Are you okay?

368
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.350
My head hurts so much.

369
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.027
Gosh.

370
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.130
What are you doing to me?

371
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.598
You're so sneaky.

372
00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:10.732
What? Sneaky?

373
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.537
If you have any shame, look in the mirror and tell me.

374
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.139
You're like a sea squirt on fire.

375
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.440
Give me that.

376
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.875
A sea squirt?

377
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.447
Where?

378
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:29.985
This is because of alcohol.

379
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.454
Did you give me alcohol?

380
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.723
I'm allergic to alcohol.

381
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.625
You should've told me earlier.

382
00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.894
- I put wine in the risotto. - What?

383
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.030
I'm in trouble.

384
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.532
It's so itchy.

385
00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.336
It's so itchy.

386
00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:50.105
Do you have to do that in front of me?

387
00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.140
What should I do?

388
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.408
Go back to Seoul right away tomorrow.

389
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.544
I'm scared that you might get in trouble again.

390
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.379
You're so irresponsible.

391
00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.648
I can't do that.

392
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.117
I can't leave. I have to be here.

393
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.419
No, you can't.

394
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.688
I can't do that.

395
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.291
I'm going to stay here even if I die.

396
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.693
Why don't you want to go back to Seoul?

397
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.697
What is it?

398
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.039
I want to find my life.

399
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.244
I never lived according to my own will.

400
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.314
I only did what my dad made me do.

401
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.783
I really want to know...

402
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.386
what I want,

403
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.454
what I want to do,

404
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:41.823
and what I'm good at.

405
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.126
No.

406
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:47.629
I just want...

407
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.099
to know what kind of person I am.

408
00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:01.310
Please.

409
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.345
Let go.

410
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.392
What are you doing?

411
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:19.061
I'm making cucumber juice.

412
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.164
At this hour? Why?

413
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.967
You need to sober up.

414
00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.704
You were ugly before, but now that you are swollen, it's worse.

415
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.809
I must have sinned in my previous life.

416
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:45.087
Coming here brings back old memories.

417
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.325
I was too busy to reminisce about these memories.

418
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.064
I remember when I bought my first car.

419
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:59.401
It was...

420
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.537
there in the alley.

421
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.641
It was parked in front of the cigar store.

422
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.046
Don't be so slow, and come here.

423
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.182
Ru Ri, this is our car.

424
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.052
Honey.

425
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:19.454
- Dad, is this really our car? - Of course.

426
00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.324
Let's ride the car right now.

427
00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.059
Let's go, Ru Ri.

428
00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.430
- I... - This is our car.

429
00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:30.632
So Won.

430
00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.735
Hey, don't do that. You might break the windows.

431
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.339
Gosh, we have a car now.

432
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.645
- Like this, like this, like this - Like this, like this, like this

433
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.548
- The seeds have sprouted - The seeds have sprouted

434
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.985
- The seeds have sprouted - The seeds have sprouted

435
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.053
Again.

436
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.790
It's still fresh in my memory.

437
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.926
The children loved it.

438
00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.830
Everyone told me I was crazy.

439
00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.634
We were living in a rented house with two rooms,

440
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.437
and yet I had bought a car.

441
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.106
I couldn't understand you then.

442
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.209
Do you know why I bought it even when people told me...

443
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.279
I was crazy?

444
00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.483
I had to live apart...

445
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.719
at the construction site...

446
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.488
in the other city for months.

447
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.862
And I missed you and the children so much...

448
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.034
that it drove me crazy.

449
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:45.040
That's why when I had even a little bit of time...

450
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.275
I came home...

451
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.113
no matter how long it took,

452
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.215
even if I had...

453
00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.584
less time to sleep.

454
00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.888
And I'd look at you and the children...

455
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.059
while you were asleep.

456
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.562
Then I went back however long it took...

457
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.665
to the construction site.

458
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.904
That's why I bought that car.

459
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.375
My heart...

460
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.044
is no different...

461
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.015
than the one I had then.

462
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.588
I think it's the same.

463
00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.224
But what happened to us?

464
00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.694
Why can't we do better than this?

465
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.832
I wanted to make you happy.

466
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.467
That's why...

467
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.037
I worked so hard.

468
00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.140
What...

469
00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.545
have I done to you?

470
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.281
What have I done...

471
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.184
to cause this?

472
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:06.822
Why are we...

473
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.424
Why are we...

474
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.827
Why have we become like this?

475
00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.275
Seoul has changed a lot.

476
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.644
I don't even recognize where we are.

477
00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.447
Have you really never set foot in Seoul during the past 10 years?

478
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.650
No, I didn't need to come here.

479
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.619
Then the person you are meeting...

480
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.487
It's been 10 years.

481
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.089
You must be happy to meet him again.

482
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.292
Well, honestly, I am looking forward to it.

483
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.062
What would his face be like when he sees me?

484
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:50.899
Would there be tears? Or would it be the opposite?

485
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.170
Excuse me.

486
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:57.606
Excuse me.

487
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.044
Who are you?

488
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.380
Is this Go Jung Do's house?

489
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.682
Yes, he's my dad.

490
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.050
Really?

491
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.153
Then you must be Eun Byul.

492
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.390
Oh, my. You've grown a lot.

493
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.093
Who is she?

494
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.528
I don't know. She's here for dad.

495
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.399
He mustn't have told you anything about me.

496
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.935
Call your dad.

497
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.072
Tell him that Choi Sun Young is back from Tokyo.

498
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.644
Guys, let's have some fruit.

499
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.778
Mom.

500
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.857
Mom? You are their mom?

501
00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:51.092
Excuse me, but who are you?

502
00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.894
I asked you a question first.

503
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.163
What's your relationship with Go Jung Do?

504
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.098
He's my husband.

505
00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.199
What?

506
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.435
Husband?

507
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.138
You are his wife?

508
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.376
I can't believe this.

509
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.945
Who are you? Who are you to...

510
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.379
Dad is here.

511
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.550
It's been a while.

512
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:24.659
Get out.

513
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.928
Are you still angry at me?

514
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.164
It's been 10 years.

515
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.865
I told you to get out.

516
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.968
Get out now! Now!

517
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.372
I think I made a good choice of coming back,

518
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.740
seeing you are still angry.

519
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.476
Dislike is a form of love.

520
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.144
Don't kid yourself.

521
00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.614
It's hatred, not dislike.

522
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.955
It's funny.

523
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.925
We'll meet again.

524
00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.697
Mom.

525
00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.333
It's okay. Don't worry.

(Contact Dancer Jung Hwa Young)

528
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:22.117
Jung Hwa Young?

529
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.857
Find out about her.

530
00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.626
Find out everything about her.

531
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.328
Yes, ma'am.

532
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.635
I'm sorry.

533
00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.938
I didn't want to get angry in front of you.

534
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.274
Who was she?

535
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.443
The person who gave birth to me.

536
00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.546
Was that your mother?

537
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.415
She doesn't deserve to be called my mother.

538
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.785
She merely gave birth to me.

539
00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:58.653
You don't have to be worried about her.

540
00:33:58.650 --> 00:33:59.687
Honey.

541
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.925
You know me. I don't hate people for no reason.

542
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.694
I don't know why she came to me,

543
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.398
but if she comes between us, everything will fall apart.

544
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.802
But don't worry. Whatever happens,

545
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.971
I will make sure she doesn't do that.

546
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:40.628
What are you doing in the dressing room all day?

547
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.696
Drink this.

548
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:42.697
What is this?

549
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.466
If it's black goat blood like last time, I'm not having it.

550
00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.235
It's not. I know you don't like it because of the smell.

551
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.904
I won't give you something you don't like. Never.

552
00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.775
- Then what is this? - It's gaesoju.

553
00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.178
Why did you spit it out? You should have swallowed it.

554
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.013
It's gone to waste.

555
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:02.584
By the way, why do you have all these bags out and packing up?

556
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.586
What's with all these bags?

557
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.088
I'm going on a trip to Jeju Island with my husband for two days.

558
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.657
It's only for two days, and yet it looks like you're moving.

559
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.026
The weather is very fickle in Jeju Island.

560
00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.595
I need to change clothes according to the weather.

561
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.296
These are for rainy days,

562
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:17.732
and those are for sunny days.

563
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.234
What about that one?

564
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.906
It's for my "fire night" with my husband.

565
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.108
Gosh, stop it.

566
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.678
- What is it, mom? - You should have told me.

567
00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.781
I'll prepare something...

568
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.584
for "fire night". Wait a moment.

569
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.553
Wait a moment. Mom.

570
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:42.357
We're going on a trip to relieve his stress...

571
00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.658
he received from his mother.

572
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.161
If you follow us, he'll only get more stress.

573
00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.696
Gosh, you are so heartless.

574
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.633
How can you be so mean?

575
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.735
You can spend a "fire night",

576
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.603
and I only give him stress?

577
00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.138
Can't I enjoy my life too?

578
00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.408
Gosh. You go ahead then!

579
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.446
Mom. Are you angry?

580
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.216
Don't be.

581
00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:19.093
My heart is no different than the one I had then.

582
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.897
But what happened to us?

583
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.334
I wanted to make you happy.

584
00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.969
What...

585
00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:32.006
have I done to you?

586
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.157
Is that all your stuff?

587
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:52.794
I'm not going on a trip.

588
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.129
I'm going to come back as soon as I find Ru Ri.

589
00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.297
I'm wondering...

590
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.033
if Ru Ri coming back will change Mom's decision.

591
00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.835
If you and Ru Ri work together,

592
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.137
she might change her mind.

593
00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.174
You're right. She always listens to her children.

594
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.277
Look after your mom while I'm away.

595
00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:12.413
- Try to change her mind. - Okay.

596
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.148
Cheer up, Father.

597
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.317
You know that I'm on your side, right?

598
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.654
Thank you. I'll go now.

599
00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.132
- You want to apply for a club mate? - Yes.

600
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.067
I regret it so much.

601
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.238
Actually, that couple was the cause of the whole accident.

602
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.073
It was an accident.

603
00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.609
We don't care who caused it.

604
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.544
It's up to you to apply,

605
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.013
but don't expect us to hire you.

606
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.048
- Manager. - You know...

607
00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.884
General Manager makes the final decision.

608
00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.088
Anyway, please think over since my life depends on it.

609
00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.198
What are you doing here?

610
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.240
She wants to work with us again.

611
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.177
What a pity. She worked very hard.

612
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.714
General Manager hates her now that he wouldn't hire her.

613
00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.153
Why would he throw this out?

614
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.432
I want to find out...

615
00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.467
what I want,

616
00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.469
what I want to do,

617
00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.071
what I'm good at,

618
00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.873
and what kind of person I am.

619
00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.486
This is the recipe that you requested.

620
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:00.855
It can change our breakfast menu.

621
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:02.623
Oh, thank you.

622
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.860
But under one condition.

623
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.906
The number you have dialed is unavailable at the moment.

624
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.242
You will be connected to the voicemail box after the beep.

625
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.946
What's she doing that she never picks up her phone?

626
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.148
She's annoying.

627
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.853
By the way, how do I get to the Visitors Bureau?

628
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.591
- Excuse me. - Yes.

629
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.626
I'm trying to get to Guam Visitors Bureau.

630
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.662
Get on the free shuttle over there,

631
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.898
and here's the time table.

632
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:46.634
- Okay. Thank you. - Goodbye.

633
00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.507
I'm sorry.

634
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:55.243
Don't be mad. You know I love you.

635
00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.112
Are you a mite?

636
00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.614
Stop getting so close. It's already so hot.

637
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.449
What do you mean?

638
00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:04.085
You shouldn't call your future husband a mite.

639
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:05.720
That's funny.

640
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.856
How could you say that after such an ugly propose?

641
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.026
Hey, that's not my fault!

642
00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:14.629
It's all because of that witch, Lee Ru Ri.

643
00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.134
It's making up for...

644
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.003
our great future.

645
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.738
Make up, my foot.

646
00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.339
Hey, Bong Myung Tae.

647
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.408
You're out of my life.

648
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.609
Go away.

649
00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.412
Ae Ri. Please stop.

650
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.448
The more you do this, the more you hurt me.

651
00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:36.884
Ae Ri. Wait up.

652
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.987
We're getting on the same plane anyway, Ae Ri.

653
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.989
- Oh, I'm sorry. - Sorry.

654
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.426
Wait. You punk.

655
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.662
What are you doing here?

656
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.864
Are you here to meet Ru Ri?

657
00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.066
- What? - You jerk.

658
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:55.903
Are you trying to start over with her now that she found...

659
00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:58.239
a job at the Visitors Bureau?

660
00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.509
Hey, get a grip.

661
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.178
Did you just say she got a job?

662
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.549
I'll give you a tip since you came a long way here.

663
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.485
If you don't see her at the Visitors Bureau,

664
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.086
go to the biggest resort here.

665
00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.155
You'll find your successful daughter there.

666
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.324
You jerk.

667
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.659
- Ae Ri. Ae Ri. - Hey, come here.

668
00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:22.396
Hey. Come here you jerk.

669
00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.832
That jerk.

670
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:27.335
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

671
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.238
He's crazy.

672
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.908
My goodness. This is so nice.

673
00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.444
- Oh, my. - Hey.

674
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.412
You can't just come in.

675
00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:39.614
Get out. Now.

676
00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:40.715
Wait.

677
00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:42.583
So is this...

678
00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.254
the historical site where you cuddled with Manager Jung?

679
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.757
This is so nice.

680
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.425
You should be working.

681
00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.027
Why did you even come here?

682
00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.595
Leave now.

683
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.963
How was it?

684
00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.465
Did your heart beat fast?

685
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.634
Or did you run out of breath?

686
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.569
Tell me now.

687
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.005
How was it to cuddle with Manager Jung's abs?

688
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.007
I told you already.

689
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.175
I was drunk, so I passed out.

690
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.045
Also, how could something happen when I looked so ugly?

691
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.813
Ru Ri, be honest.

692
00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.216
Do you like Manager Jung?

693
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.818
- Do you love him? - Hey.

694
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.389
I just met him. I don't know anything about him.

695
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:23.858
I admit...

696
00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.527
that he's hot.

697
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:31.299
He's also generous.

698
00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.734
Look at you.

699
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.337
Wait. Manager Jung likes you too.

700
00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.406
Are you two flirting right now?

701
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.908
No way, Manager Jung.

702
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.643
Stop it, Myung Rang.

703
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.212
He's not interested in me at all.

704
00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.515
He asked General Manager to consider...

705
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.216
hiring you today.

706
00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.484
He swallowed his pride.

707
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.819
Can you still say that he's not interested in you now?

708
00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.387
- Are you serious? - Yes.

709
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.358
Then why would he scold me for eating a lot?

710
00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.694
Or tell me to move out, or say that I'm pathetic?

711
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:00.995
Why would he keep scolding me?

712
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:03.064
What should I do with you?

713
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.633
You're so bad at reading a man's heart.

714
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.469
Think about it. He has no other choice.

715
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:09.737
What do you mean?

716
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.674
He's refusing to love you...

717
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.843
because of the aftereffect of the burn that you caused.

718
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:18.145
He's trying his best to push you away.

719
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.014
Can't you see that he's pushing you away?

720
00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:21.315
No way.

721
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.984
If you can't believe me,

722
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.720
I'll make a reservation at a fancy restaurant for you.

723
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.821
You can go check.

724
00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:29.924
How?

725
00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:31.492
If the man hesitates,

726
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.028
- you should make a move first. - I should do that?

727
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.429
If he says yes, then you'll start dating,

728
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:36.864
but if not, you'll be embarrassed.

729
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:37.965
Hey.

730
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.568
You shouldn't delay it.

731
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:42.903
Don't regret it later.

732
00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:44.739
Just get down to it first.

733
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:46.741
Good luck.

734
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:49.944
(Guam Visitors Bureau)

735
00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.279
What?

736
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:55.883
I think there's been a mistake. There's no one named Lee Ru Ri.

737
00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.885
We do have two Korean employees,

738
00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.320
but they're both men.

739
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.926
If you don't see her at the Visitors Bureau, go to the biggest resort.

740
00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.095
You'll find your successful daughter there.

741
00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:22.376
Don't even think about drinking, or you'll become a sea squirt again.

742
00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:23.911
Hey, Lee Ru Ri.

743
00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.883
Make a move first.

744
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.123
Why did you want to see me...

745
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:37.658
in here?

746
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.468
If I don't get the club mate position,

747
00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.838
I have to go to Seoul tomorrow.

748
00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:57.545
Since it's my last day in Guam, I wanted to spend time with you.

749
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.682
Did you put on a make up?

750
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:03.384
Pardon?

751
00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.154
No, I didn't.

752
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:11.325
I'm not trying to look pretty for you or anything.

753
00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:20.134
Thank you for supporting me,

754
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.071
and providing me with a place to sleep until now.

755
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.840
Also,

756
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.943
thank you very much anyway.

757
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:38.586
Hey, stop talking gibberish, and eat your food.

758
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.588
Your stomach is calling for food.

759
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:41.989
Okay.

760
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.092
Enjoy your food.

761
00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.648
You're eating like a pig.

762
00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.183
Slow down, or you'll get sick.

763
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.719
Okay.

764
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:26.634
What is it? You're scaring me.

765
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.103
Your eyes are already big enough.

766
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.139
- Did something get in your eyes? - What?

767
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.343
It's not like that. You should use it first.

768
00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.159
Are you chopping something?

769
00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.627
Do you have hand tremor?

770
00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:56.163
What? No, I don't.

771
00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.174
Stay still.

772
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:09.543
What?

773
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.279
What are you...

774
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.815
What are you...

775
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:26.694
Lee Ru Ri, he's pretending otherwise, but he likes you too.

776
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.465
It's weird.

777
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:34.568
You haven't been drinking, and yet you're red in the face...

778
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.070
and sweating a lot.

779
00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.446
There's no fever, but she's panting.

780
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:52.486
You can be honest with me.

781
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:55.155
Do you perhaps...

782
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.857
Perhaps?

783
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.265
- Do you have a chronic disease? - What?

784
00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.234
Oh, Lee Ru Ri.

785
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:08.502
I know her very well.

786
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:10.304
She worked here until recently.

787
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.773
Here? What did she do here?

788
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:13.974
Club mate.

789
00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.175
Club mate?

790
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.412
I was very close to her even though she quit lately.

791
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:19.780
She quit?

792
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:25.753
Then this girl, my daughter,

793
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.656
where should I go to see her?

794
00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:34.662
Where is this place?

795
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:38.933
A man's house who lives together with her.

796
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:42.202
Live together?

797
00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:50.177
You should eat this. I went really far to buy this.

798
00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.112
You shouldn't have. I know you're busy.

799
00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:54.448
Father asked me to...

800
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.050
take care of you.

801
00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:58.986
He's trying to be different. He wants to be better.

802
00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.587
I don't believe his words.

803
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.856
People don't change easily.

804
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:09.396
But the life we have led together keeps stopping me.

805
00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.634
I still feel attached to him even though I dislike him.

806
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:17.738
The long 34 years I lived with him and the memories...

807
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:20.240
keep stopping me.

808
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:25.546
Yes, Mom. Please give him one more chance.

809
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.548
Try to see him more positively.

810
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.818
He went to Guam to fetch Ru Ri.

811
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.054
What?

812
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.823
He went to see Ru Ri?

813
00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.025
Yes. He must have been desperate...

814
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.927
as he went to bring Ru Ri to persuade you.

815
00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.762
Gosh, I can't believe this.

816
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.905
No, this was going to happen anyway.

817
00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.907
What are you talking about?

818
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.542
Ru Ri is going to get in trouble...

819
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:57.845
because of me.

820
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:10.758
Do you feel better after walking?

821
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.361
If you're not feeling well, we can go home.

822
00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:17.865
What? No, I'm totally fine.

823
00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.633
Don't make me worry about you.

824
00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:22.136
If I keep living with you, I don't think I can live long.

825
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.245
Why are you laughing?

826
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:34.882
What? No, it's nothing.

827
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:42.256
Why do you keep laughing?

828
00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:46.393
I don't know why, but I can't stop laughing.

829
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:52.332
I am happy to be able to walk here with you.

830
00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.201
That's nothing to be happy about.

831
00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:05.913
When I go back to Seoul, I'll miss this spot the most.

832
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:08.549
Whenever I came here feeling frustrated,

833
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.384
I'd get better again.

834
00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:12.052
Really?

835
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.655
How sad.

836
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.495
Then stand over there.

837
00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.465
I'll take a picture of you here.

838
00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.468
What? No, I don't take pictures.

839
00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.070
I don't take pictures because I look like a pumpkin.

840
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:33.674
Pumpkins look like pumpkins, not anything better.

841
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:35.175
Stand over there.

842
00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.543
It's all right.

843
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:45.819
Take your hoodie off.

844
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:57.464
You won't look nice in a picture like that.

845
00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.511
You look much better.

846
00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.314
Don't frown.

847
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:15.949
Tilt your head a little.

848
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.218
Say "cookie".

849
00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:54.154
What's wrong with me?

850
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:24.051
- Hello. - Hi.

851
00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.086
The homeowner is not here at this moment.

852
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.154
How do you know?

853
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:30.757
I saw him and his girlfriend at that beach on my way here.

854
00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:32.926
Girlfriend?

855
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.467
What are you doing?

856
00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.503
I'm trying to keep the sea in my heart.

857
00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.742
Did I get used to her now?

858
00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.544
She's adorable.

859
00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:54.615
Get a hold of yourself, Jung Tae Yang.

860
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:09.363
I will never forget you.

861
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:11.665
Why not?

862
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:16.703
You are the only man who has been nice to me.

863
00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:24.444
You always get dumped easily because you get moved by men so easily.

864
00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.549
The world is large, and there are so many men in it.

865
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:34.388
You should make good guys line up in front of you.

866
00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:39.860
And don't get upset tomorrow.

867
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:42.696
Even if you don't make the club mate again,

868
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:45.165
you should believe in yourself.

869
00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:49.836
You can do everything if you just believe that you can.

870
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.354
Hey, Lee Ru Ri! Today's your last chance.

871
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.757
You should do it. You should make a move first.

872
00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:12.693
And...

873
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:16.263
even when you get to Seoul, be prepared for everything.

874
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.865
Think about what you can do best,

875
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:22.336
and what you want to do.

876
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.455
I'm so sorry.

877
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:43.990
Was that unpleasant?

878
00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:46.693
I wasn't going to,

879
00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:48.795
but Myung Rang kept telling me to make sure...

880
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.334
I mean, I don't know how you feel about me.

881
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.738
What's wrong?

882
00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:44.718
Dad?

883
00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.387
Dad?

884
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.658
- Hello. - Dad!

885
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:53.894
- Dad. - You.

886
00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:55.695
Who do you think you are?

887
00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:57.798
Do you know who I am?

888
00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:00.567
I went around the construction sites around the world.

889
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.403
I'm sorry, Dad. Let me explain. Wait, Dad.

890
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.005
I'll kill you today.

891
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.507
- You jerk. - Dad.

892
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.443
How dare you do that to my daughter?

893
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.044
- Who do you think you are? - Dad, please.

894
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.179
You jerk.

895
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.383
- Dad. - Get up! Get up, you jerk.

896
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.088
I think there's a misunderstanding, sir.

897
00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.424
Shut your mouth. I don't want to talk to you.

898
00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.393
- Calm down. - Be quiet!

899
00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:31.565
Dad. Let me explain.

900
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.433
What happened was...

901
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:36.603
I don't need your excuse. Just answer my question.

902
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.472
Did you...

903
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.741
lie about getting a job at the Visitors Bureau?

904
00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:46.313
Did you lie to me all this time,

905
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:50.217
and worked as a club mate instead?

906
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.388
I'm sorry, Dad.

907
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:58.024
Is it true...

908
00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.894
you live at his house?

909
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:02.562
- Sir, actually... - Be quiet.

910
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:04.064
Be quiet.

911
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:10.570
Tell me. Is it true?

912
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.273
It's true that I'm staying at his house,

913
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:15.675
but it's not what you think it is.

914
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.444
I had a problem...

915
00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:20.046
that I was only staying at his house for a while.

916
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.555
I'm sorry, Dad.

917
00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.092
I've never been...

918
00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:36.897
so ashamed like today in my whole life.

919
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.400
You.

920
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:42.702
You never...

921
00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:46.506
made me happy.

922
00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.277
You always lacked something.

923
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:53.213
You always made me worry.

924
00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.983
That wasn't enough that...

925
00:58:57.530 --> 00:59:00.353
you're at your lowest bottom now.

926
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:03.023
It's also my fault.

927
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:05.158
Dad.

928
00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:06.593
Listen to me carefully.

929
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.297
You're no longer my daughter.

930
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.632
Don't call me as dad.

931
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:14.067
Don't even think about coming back home.

932
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:16.836
We're done here.

933
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:21.775
You chose this kind of life.

934
00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:26.046
Suit yourself. Do whatever you want.

935
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:28.949
I won't care anymore.

936
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:30.150
- Dad. - Suit yourself.

937
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:31.318
Dad. Dad.

938
00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:32.385
Let me go!

939
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.255
Dad. Dad.

940
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.857
- I'm sorry, Dad. - Move.

941
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:39.659
Please forgive me, Dad.

942
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.462
You're not my daughter.

943
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:44.130
You're not!

944
00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.232
I'm not your dad.

945
00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:48.201
You're not my daughter.

946
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.173
Dad.

947
00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.943
Dad.

948
00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.379
I can't believe it.

949
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:03.950
Dad!
