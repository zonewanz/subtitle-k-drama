00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.020
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:11.160
Ru Ri was crying, and she was 
a mess yesterday.

3
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:13.680
Her mother fainted.

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.410
I think she should see a psychiatrist.

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.180
A psychiatrist?

6
00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:25.950
Are you saying my wife...

7
00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.610
has a mental problem?

8
00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:32.740
According to her results, her blood 
vessels don't have problems.

9
00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:36.430
But she fainted because the front part 
of her heart didn't move.

10
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
What do you mean by that?

11
00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:42.300
Anyway, we will have to talk
 to a psychiatrist.

12
00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:44.710
Okay.

13
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.480
What is happening?

14
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.910
They're treating a normal person
 as a crazy woman.

15
00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:55.250
I can't believe this.

16
00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:06.710
How have you been?

17
00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:08.060
Why are you here?

18
00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.300
Are you here to see Ru Ri?

19
00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:14.870
No, I'm here for a checkup.

20
00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:16.240
Are you sure?

21
00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.860
Are you trying to deceive me?

22
00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:21.010
No, I'm not. Don't worry.

23
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:23.230
Let me make this sure again.

24
00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:27.080
I hate people like you the most.

25
00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:30.390
You're insincere and irresponsible.

26
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.750
You don't take care of fragile women,

27
00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:35.690
and treat them inferior to you.

28
00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:39.930
You're a beast that humiliates other men.

29
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.460
I admit that, sir.

30
00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.130
I didn't make the best impression to you.

31
00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:48.300
However, there're other sides of me.

32
00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:52.610
If you give me some time, I'd like to show you my true self.

33
00:01:55.432 --> 00:01:57.160
You're a smooth talker.

34
00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:58.610
Why should I do that?

35
00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:03.590
Do you still have feelings for my daughter?

36
00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:05.850
If that's so, stop dreaming.

37
00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:10.460
I have no intention to have a son-in-law like you.

38
00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:13.530
Over my dead body.

39
00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:25.610
Was that Ru Ri's dad?

40
00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.140
Yes, it was.

41
00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:29.240
Even his back gives me goosebumps.

42
00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:31.380
Why are you here?

43
00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:34.080
What? I'm here to hand over this kid.

44
00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.100
- Is that the child? - Yes.

45
00:02:38.108 --> 00:02:40.420
I need to go prepare for the enlistment.

46
00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.030
What's your name?

47
00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:46.630
You punk.

48
00:02:47.484 --> 00:02:50.000
You look like Ru Ri, so you're really cute.

49
00:02:56.393 --> 00:02:59.460
Honey, why do you look so tired?

50
00:02:59.462 --> 00:03:01.510
You won't even look me in the eye since yesterday.

51
00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:03.510
Did I do something wrong?

52
00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:08.130
Goodness, Yeon Ju. How could you be so clueless?

53
00:03:08.138 --> 00:03:10.070
You're so not quick-witted.

54
00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:13.100
Hey, right now, your father-in-law had an affair...

55
00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.010
and brought a child with him out of the blue.

56
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:18.890
Do you think your husband would want to smile and laugh?

57
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.280
But thank goodness...

58
00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.930
that your husband doesn't take after your father-in-law.

59
00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.740
Thank you so much, Doctor Lee.

60
00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:31.610
Me too, honey.

61
00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:37.680
I'm off now.

62
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.240
All right. I'll let you slide for being so pessimistic today.

63
00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:47.870
Think about your mother, and get yourself together!

64
00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:51.410
Make sure you have the right leg to operate on!

65
00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:53.090
Don't lose your focus.

66
00:03:57.454 --> 00:03:58.530
(Needs absolute rest)

67
00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.690
The patient just fell asleep after getting the sedative.

68
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:03.150
Oh, right. Don't go far.

69
00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.890
Your mom is only asking for you.

70
00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:07.310
Okay. Thank you.

71
00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:14.580
(Needs absolute rest)

72
00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:30.050
Let me see your phone. Give it to me.

73
00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:31.420
What? Why?

74
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:33.990
Just do it. Let me have it.

75
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.100
Dad.

76
00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:38.110
I'm going to confiscate it for a while.

77
00:04:38.728 --> 00:04:41.840
You might be in contact with some loser.

78
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:46.930
Ru Ri. What happened?

79
00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:48.980
Hello, Mr. Lee.

80
00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.540
Myung Rang, how could you bring her here?

81
00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.540
Goodness, look at you. I'm busy preparing for the enlistment.

82
00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.540
Okay. Good job looking after her.

83
00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:00.880
Come here, Han Gyul.

84
00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.660
No, it's okay.

85
00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:05.920
I'll feed her in the cafeteria first.

86
00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:08.850
You said you're busy. I'll feed her. You can go.

87
00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:10.990
Goodness.

88
00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:12.790
What about me? I don't get to eat?

89
00:05:12.796 --> 00:05:14.560
I'm hungry too.

90
00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.360
Come on. Buy me a meal. Hurry.

91
00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:18.930
- I'm sorry. - What...

92
00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:21.050
- You said you're busy. - Gosh, I'm hungry.

93
00:05:27.177 --> 00:05:28.970
Hey, Myung Rang.

94
00:05:28.978 --> 00:05:30.180
Why are we running?

95
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.110
Oh, dear. You are horrible at reading the room.

96
00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:34.380
Don't speak another word, and just follow me.

97
00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:35.880
You'll be surprised!

98
00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:36.970
What?

99
00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:47.540
(Chef Jung)

100
00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:49.780
"Chef Jung"?

101
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.050
Who is this Chef Jung?

102
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.160
Hey, gourmand. I couldn't reach you.

103
00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:04.160
Are you listening?

104
00:06:05.682 --> 00:06:08.180
I guess you can't talk now.

105
00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:09.730
I'll wait for you in the lobby.

106
00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.330
Hey, hey. Excuse me.

107
00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:16.970
I think I heard his voice somewhere.

108
00:06:18.695 --> 00:06:19.740
Lobby?

109
00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:22.790
How have you been?

110
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.410
Why are you here?

111
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.420
Look at this joker.

112
00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:35.170
Hey, Myung Rang, where are we going?

113
00:06:35.178 --> 00:06:37.040
- The cafeteria is in the basement. - Goodness.

114
00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:39.040
There's something more important than your meal.

115
00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:40.530
What is it?

116
00:06:41.251 --> 00:06:42.460
That.

117
00:06:48.258 --> 00:06:49.340
Chef Jung!

118
00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:53.930
Let this go.

119
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.980
Hi.

120
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:07.290
Hey, you!

121
00:07:08.378 --> 00:07:09.590
What is it?

122
00:07:09.813 --> 00:07:11.530
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:17.170
All right.

124
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.300
Ru Ri.

125
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.610
I'll be outside with your sister.

126
00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:26.610
If there's anything you need to do with him, take your time.

127
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.980
What does that mean?

128
00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:32.680
That's only for adults. You don't need to know.

129
00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:34.850
Myung Rang!

130
00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.220
Gosh, you two look good.

131
00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:41.810
What's wrong with her?

132
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:43.740
As she said, we don't have a lot of time.

133
00:07:43.746 --> 00:07:44.980
Let's get our things done.

134
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:46.160
What?

135
00:07:49.486 --> 00:07:51.230
What do you mean by that?

136
00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:56.970
Here.

137
00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:01.430
I see. The sandwich.

138
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:02.980
Yes, the sandwich.

139
00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:06.030
What? Did you expect something else?

140
00:08:06.035 --> 00:08:09.600
No way. Actually, I was very hungry.

141
00:08:09.606 --> 00:08:11.540
I was craving a sandwich.

142
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:13.540
I was so surprised to see this sandwich magically appear.

143
00:08:13.543 --> 00:08:16.520
That's right. You're such a voracious eater.

144
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.980
The caregivers have a harder time than the patients.

145
00:08:19.983 --> 00:08:21.400
Don't skip your meals.

146
00:08:26.356 --> 00:08:28.470
Why? Is that too small?

147
00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:31.560
Hey, it was so hectic during the morning rush hour.

148
00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:33.270
It was so hard to even buy one.

149
00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:36.590
I'm sorry, Chef Jung.

150
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.200
It's your first day at the headquarters.

151
00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:39.860
I'm sorry for bothering you.

152
00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:42.880
Thanks to you, this will be the most unforgettable first day.

153
00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:47.420
And...

154
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.760
I really want to go to work,

155
00:08:51.247 --> 00:08:54.660
but I don't think I can leave my mom alone.

156
00:08:54.884 --> 00:08:56.080
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:56.085 --> 00:08:57.400
Don't worry.

158
00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.300
You're not much of help to begin with.

159
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.910
Don't worry, and just take care of your mom.

160
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:09.280
But the intern has to do all the chores.

161
00:09:09.499 --> 00:09:12.500
I have to wash the dirty dishes, clean,

162
00:09:12.502 --> 00:09:14.700
prepare ingredients, and gather data from the websites.

163
00:09:14.704 --> 00:09:15.780
Didn't I tell you?

164
00:09:16.372 --> 00:09:17.920
You're not much of help.

165
00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:22.660
I already asked for a replacement. Don't worry.

166
00:09:23.246 --> 00:09:24.880
What about the proposal for the new dish?

167
00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:27.150
I have to go grocery shopping and brainstorm.

168
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.260
Look at you.

169
00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.930
Others may think you're the backbone of SC Food and Beverage.

170
00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.170
I'll take care of everything. You don't need to worry about it.

171
00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:38.870
Just stay by your mom's side for now.

172
00:09:42.098 --> 00:09:43.140
What?

173
00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:45.280
It's nothing.

174
00:09:46.402 --> 00:09:48.180
What is it? Tell me.

175
00:09:49.272 --> 00:09:51.390
Before I saw you,

176
00:09:52.075 --> 00:09:54.420
it was so hard, and I didn't know what to do.

177
00:09:55.712 --> 00:09:59.130
Seeing you here is lifting my spirits.

178
00:10:01.084 --> 00:10:04.030
That's right. You should consider yourself lucky.

179
00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:06.650
It's hard to meet such a nice supervisor.

180
00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:09.650
And I'm also really embarrassed...

181
00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:11.810
that you had to see how messed up my family is.

182
00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:14.040
Are you bragging about your family now?

183
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.180
My family is second to none in this respect.

184
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:18.780
I'm not joking.

185
00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:21.250
Ru Ri.

186
00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:24.050
You're prettiest when you smile.

187
00:10:24.974 --> 00:10:26.150
So...

188
00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.620
let's smile even if things are hard.

189
00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.900
Your mom will be fine soon enough.

190
00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:55.520
Where are they?

191
00:10:55.838 --> 00:10:57.290
Those punks.

192
00:11:01.277 --> 00:11:02.410
Yes, Mr. Lee!

193
00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.470
Where are you now?

194
00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:07.610
Now? We are eating in the cafeteria.

195
00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:08.850
How dare you lie to me!

196
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:10.800
I'm in the cafeteria right now.

197
00:11:10.953 --> 00:11:12.180
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:12.188 --> 00:11:13.900
Lee Myung Rang! Myung Rang!

199
00:11:15.124 --> 00:11:17.670
What? Look at these punks.

200
00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:22.460
Hold on. Then... Right.

201
00:11:22.465 --> 00:11:24.410
Gosh, he's terrifying.

202
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.420
His voice even makes my hair stand up.

203
00:11:28.004 --> 00:11:30.050
Poor Ru Ri.

204
00:11:30.373 --> 00:11:33.520
How did she survive under this oppression and pressure?

205
00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:36.260
Wait. I can't just do nothing about this.

206
00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:39.290
If he finds this out, she's done.

207
00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:40.930
No, no. I can't let that happen.

208
00:11:42.518 --> 00:11:43.720
No.

209
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.800
They must be pretty busy. I can't ruin their flow.

210
00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.440
What should I do?

211
00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:50.200
Let's save her life first.

212
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.360
Ru Ri.

213
00:11:53.362 --> 00:11:54.910
Stop enjoying yourself.

214
00:11:55.398 --> 00:11:58.230
Ru Ri! Stop it!

215
00:11:58.234 --> 00:11:59.500
What is it? I'm busy.

216
00:11:59.502 --> 00:12:01.130
Ru Ri!

217
00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.180
What? What? What is it?

218
00:12:03.606 --> 00:12:04.650
What?

219
00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:19.720
Where is she?

220
00:12:19.722 --> 00:12:22.000
She's probably getting coffee.

221
00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.910
You are going to keep deceiving me?

222
00:12:29.132 --> 00:12:30.440
Where is your sister?

223
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:34.650
She's not here!

224
00:12:36.072 --> 00:12:37.420
I'm sorry, Ru Ri.

225
00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.660
Move.

226
00:12:59.162 --> 00:13:00.780
Lee Ru Ri!

227
00:13:01.464 --> 00:13:02.580
Ru Ri!

228
00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:05.380
Ru Ri!

229
00:13:05.735 --> 00:13:07.750
I know you're there!

230
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.480
Come here!

231
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:13.150
Lee Ru Ri!

232
00:13:14.477 --> 00:13:16.060
Ru Ri!

233
00:13:19.849 --> 00:13:21.060
Oh, my.

234
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.400
I was so scared.

235
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:26.630
Why are you so fast?

236
00:13:27.957 --> 00:13:30.670
We're going to die if my dad catches us.

237
00:13:32.528 --> 00:13:34.410
Hurry up, and go inside. I'll leave.

238
00:13:35.331 --> 00:13:38.580
I'm sorry. I caused you so much trouble.

239
00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:42.050
I'll be waiting 24 hours. Call me whenever you want.

240
00:13:43.005 --> 00:13:44.150
I'm going.

241
00:14:08.631 --> 00:14:10.410
There's no one here. Why are you so scared?

242
00:14:11.901 --> 00:14:14.880
Why did you want me to come to work one hour early?

243
00:14:16.472 --> 00:14:19.050
Did you forget what Manager Joo said?

244
00:14:20.877 --> 00:14:22.240
What will you do then?

245
00:14:22.245 --> 00:14:25.330
We have to get rid of the two people who joined us through connections.

246
00:14:25.748 --> 00:14:26.930
You're going to get rid of them.

247
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.430
- Me? - Should I do it then?

248
00:14:33.222 --> 00:14:35.200
Change that with this.

249
00:14:38.828 --> 00:14:39.940
Hurry.

250
00:14:58.614 --> 00:15:00.330
(Cheese potato hamburger that can be eaten with a spoon)

251
00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:01.930
(Pork neck fries salad)

252
00:15:06.355 --> 00:15:09.540
We need to show something definite to the directors.

253
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.910
New menus of this level won't make the cut.

254
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.140
I need Jung Do.

255
00:15:18.868 --> 00:15:21.100
She suddenly disappeared one day.

256
00:15:21.103 --> 00:15:23.330
There were rumors that she was living with a man.

257
00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:24.400
What kind of a man?

258
00:15:24.407 --> 00:15:26.420
It was "Jay". His name was Jay.

259
00:15:27.276 --> 00:15:28.420
Jay.

260
00:15:30.112 --> 00:15:35.160
Something must have happened with him 30 years ago.

261
00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.670
What could that be?

262
00:15:44.994 --> 00:15:46.890
I got a call from Seattle.

263
00:15:46.896 --> 00:15:48.010
Let me see.

264
00:15:54.003 --> 00:15:56.020
This is Sarah Kang, Jung Hwa Young's sister.

265
00:15:56.238 --> 00:15:58.650
She was a professor, but quit seven years ago.

266
00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:01.470
Where is she now?

267
00:16:01.477 --> 00:16:04.290
We're trying to find her, but it's not easy.

268
00:16:07.016 --> 00:16:08.800
What about that man called Jay?

269
00:16:09.318 --> 00:16:10.530
We can't find him either.

270
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.700
This was too long ago. It's hard to find him just with his name.

271
00:16:13.756 --> 00:16:16.200
I don't care how much it costs.

272
00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:20.910
Search every corner of Seattle, and bring that man to me.

273
00:16:21.464 --> 00:16:22.540
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.090
(Alcoholism remedy)

275
00:16:59.502 --> 00:17:02.420
Who is he cooking for that he's putting in so much effort?

276
00:17:02.638 --> 00:17:05.290
Is he cooking for the chairman?

277
00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:06.790
Come on.

278
00:17:09.378 --> 00:17:13.930
He keeps trying to make a good impression to the chairman.

279
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.430
- Give me your phone. - Okay.

280
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.600
Here it is.

281
00:17:23.826 --> 00:17:27.410
Manager Joo. I have something to report about Jung Tae Yang.

282
00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:30.950
What do you mean?

283
00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:32.350
What about Jung Tae Yang?

284
00:17:32.668 --> 00:17:34.320
I'm worried about you.

285
00:17:35.037 --> 00:17:38.220
It won't be good if the company knows about your condition.

286
00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:41.170
What do you want to do about it?

287
00:17:41.177 --> 00:17:44.330
We need to keep Jung Tae Yang quiet first.

288
00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.080
Even if we have to fire him.

289
00:17:47.083 --> 00:17:48.430
He won't talk about me.

290
00:17:48.884 --> 00:17:50.230
Don't be ridiculous.

291
00:17:51.787 --> 00:17:53.600
Don't you know that people can get greedy?

292
00:17:53.889 --> 00:17:58.070
He will try to use your weakness to his advantage.

293
00:18:11.273 --> 00:18:12.370
What is this?

294
00:18:12.374 --> 00:18:13.950
It's the chairman's breakfast.

295
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.670
You looked sick yesterday. Are you feeling okay?

296
00:18:30.893 --> 00:18:32.470
I made this early in the morning.

297
00:18:32.628 --> 00:18:33.910
I hope you enjoy it.

298
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:41.330
Who sent this?

299
00:18:41.337 --> 00:18:43.920
He just said that he was from the menu development team.

300
00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:47.560
It's clear that it's Jung Tae Yang.

301
00:18:48.444 --> 00:18:50.420
He sent this to pretend that he cares for you.

302
00:18:50.446 --> 00:18:53.360
"I know your weakness. Be careful."

303
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:54.830
Don't you think he's trying to say that?

304
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.810
I wanted to be sure.

305
00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:08.440
I was wondering if you had a child.

306
00:19:11.634 --> 00:19:12.850
No.

307
00:19:13.435 --> 00:19:16.220
He can't know about the existence of Tae Yang.

308
00:19:40.129 --> 00:19:41.840
(Math progress book)

309
00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:45.680
Let's see my score.

310
00:19:46.468 --> 00:19:48.850
Let's check your results.

311
00:19:50.072 --> 00:19:52.120
You got 100 points.

312
00:19:54.343 --> 00:19:57.140
Eun Byul, you can study well all by yourself.

313
00:19:57.146 --> 00:19:58.830
Don't worry about me.

314
00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:00.690
How did it go?

315
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.870
I feel relieved.

316
00:20:06.322 --> 00:20:09.200
I'm saying goodbye to this prison forever.

317
00:20:09.892 --> 00:20:13.360
Do you think it's okay to not tell mom?

318
00:20:13.362 --> 00:20:16.540
Of course, she just started to feel better yesterday.

319
00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.380
It's going to be hard for us if she's mad again.

320
00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:20.630
Anyway, congratulations.

321
00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.480
All you have to do is register for the beauty class.

322
00:20:22.571 --> 00:20:23.680
Yes.

323
00:20:34.016 --> 00:20:36.500
It smells like kimchi jjim. I'm so hungry.

324
00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:38.320
You slept really well yesterday.

325
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.530
You even snored.

326
00:20:40.623 --> 00:20:42.440
I'm still sleepy no matter how much I sleep.

327
00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:44.410
Maybe it's because my 30-year-old tension is relieved.

328
00:20:44.426 --> 00:20:47.020
Just forget about that person,

329
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:48.680
and just think of good things from now on.

330
00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.160
I'll do that.

331
00:20:50.165 --> 00:20:52.810
Our unhappiness is over. We're going to start being happy.

332
00:20:55.604 --> 00:20:56.720
Wait a minute.

333
00:20:58.907 --> 00:21:00.190
Yes, Coach?

334
00:21:02.544 --> 00:21:03.660
What?

335
00:21:06.081 --> 00:21:09.430
Yes, I got it.

336
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.970
Why? Is Woo Joo in trouble?

337
00:21:14.023 --> 00:21:16.200
What am I going to do with him?

338
00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.070
We're home.

339
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.110
It smells really good.

340
00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:25.310
I'm really hungry because I practiced hard.

341
00:21:25.401 --> 00:21:27.310
Are you coming from the practice?

342
00:21:27.336 --> 00:21:29.570
Of course, the competition is coming up soon.

343
00:21:29.571 --> 00:21:32.500
The coach is making us practice hard.

344
00:21:32.508 --> 00:21:33.690
Hey!

345
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.670
Do you think I'm a fool?

346
00:21:35.678 --> 00:21:37.620
The coach just called.

347
00:21:38.947 --> 00:21:40.890
He said you were going to quit judo.

348
00:21:41.617 --> 00:21:42.860
What is the reason?

349
00:21:43.585 --> 00:21:44.720
Judo is not for me.

350
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.690
Woo Joo, how could you decide that by yourself?

351
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.440
Do you think parents are there for nothing?

352
00:21:49.858 --> 00:21:52.110
- You should have talked to us. - Then what?

353
00:21:52.861 --> 00:21:54.110
Would you allow me to quit?

354
00:21:54.163 --> 00:21:56.680
Mom, you just want me to go to college.

355
00:21:57.366 --> 00:21:59.700
She just wants you to do your best since you will qualify...

356
00:21:59.702 --> 00:22:03.080
for special admission if you win a medal.

357
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.360
Will you study if you quit judo?

358
00:22:09.478 --> 00:22:10.820
I'm going to quit school.

359
00:22:11.513 --> 00:22:14.380
With my grades, I have no hope even if I try many times.

360
00:22:14.383 --> 00:22:15.900
What will you do if you quit school?

361
00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:20.970
Tell me what you will do.

362
00:22:21.957 --> 00:22:24.910
Woo Joo, just tell them.

363
00:22:27.129 --> 00:22:28.480
Aren't you going to tell us?

364
00:22:36.972 --> 00:22:41.000
Is this what you want to do?

365
00:22:41.009 --> 00:22:42.820
To put on makeup like women?

366
00:22:43.312 --> 00:22:45.330
He wants to become a beauty consultant.

367
00:22:45.381 --> 00:22:48.130
He wants to teach people how to put on makeup that suits them.

368
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.430
Are you crazy?

369
00:22:52.688 --> 00:22:53.900
What is this?

370
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.700
The registration fee for beauty class.

371
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:01.340
Woo Joo worked the whole summer doing nails for people.

372
00:23:01.897 --> 00:23:05.150
So you lied about hurting your leg?

373
00:23:05.267 --> 00:23:08.720
And you earned this money by doing nail art instead of Judo?

374
00:23:12.508 --> 00:23:13.620
I'm taking this away.

375
00:23:14.109 --> 00:23:16.510
Give it to me. I earned it by myself.

376
00:23:16.512 --> 00:23:17.590
Give it to me.

377
00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:18.690
You earned it?

378
00:23:19.448 --> 00:23:21.410
Are you proud of the money...

379
00:23:21.417 --> 00:23:24.160
you earned from working while lying to your parents?

380
00:23:24.386 --> 00:23:26.430
You should think about what you did wrong first.

381
00:23:35.798 --> 00:23:38.010
I'll announce the promotion topic for the fourth quarter.

382
00:23:38.367 --> 00:23:41.060
Two months later, it will be Christmas season.

383
00:23:41.069 --> 00:23:43.130
To prepare for Christmas, the two teams...

384
00:23:43.138 --> 00:23:45.400
should develop a new menu within two weeks.

385
00:23:45.407 --> 00:23:49.060
It should go along with the season and target families.

386
00:23:49.478 --> 00:23:52.990
You should prepare generous amounts of food with reasonable prices.

387
00:23:53.615 --> 00:23:57.330
He will try to use your weakness to his advantage.

388
00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.170
Through evaluation,

389
00:24:00.322 --> 00:24:03.100
the team with the best result will stay.

390
00:24:03.292 --> 00:24:04.920
- Good luck. - All right.

391
00:24:04.927 --> 00:24:06.120
All right.

392
00:24:06.128 --> 00:24:07.170
That's all.

393
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.380
By the way, Jung Tae Yang,

394
00:24:10.466 --> 00:24:11.910
I'd like to talk to you in my room.

395
00:24:20.509 --> 00:24:23.060
Did you make this for me?

396
00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:25.990
Didn't you like it?

397
00:24:26.248 --> 00:24:27.440
You didn't even touch it.

398
00:24:27.449 --> 00:24:29.260
I want to know your intentions.

399
00:24:29.952 --> 00:24:33.530
I want to know why you made this for me.

400
00:24:35.324 --> 00:24:37.670
I didn't have any intentions.

401
00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:42.580
You looked like you were in a bad state at the parking lot yesterday,

402
00:24:42.931 --> 00:24:46.200
so I thought you wouldn't feel great today. That's why I made this.

403
00:24:46.201 --> 00:24:48.120
Throughout my life,

404
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.420
I encountered a lot of people.

405
00:24:50.973 --> 00:24:54.720
I encountered more bad people than good.

406
00:24:56.345 --> 00:24:59.190
But the people that I hate the most...

407
00:25:00.516 --> 00:25:04.430
are the ones that try to benefit from others' weaknesses.

408
00:25:07.956 --> 00:25:11.410
You must have seen the medicine I take yesterday.

409
00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:14.290
If you think you can take advantage of me with that,

410
00:25:14.296 --> 00:25:15.440
you're wrong.

411
00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:19.580
Just like I employed you because I wanted to,

412
00:25:19.968 --> 00:25:21.720
I can fire you if I want to.

413
00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:24.650
So don't try to do anything,

414
00:25:25.874 --> 00:25:27.150
and get back to work.

415
00:25:43.058 --> 00:25:44.910
Let me tell you something.

416
00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:50.740
I think food is for people who eat it,

417
00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:53.180
not the person who makes it.

418
00:25:55.437 --> 00:25:57.180
While I made this,

419
00:25:57.205 --> 00:25:59.450
I have never thought about myself.

420
00:26:00.342 --> 00:26:03.010
In Bali, when you were starving for days,

421
00:26:03.011 --> 00:26:05.610
I made you rice soup because I wanted to help you...

422
00:26:05.614 --> 00:26:06.930
eat something.

423
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.930
And that's the same thought I had when I made this.

424
00:26:13.388 --> 00:26:15.900
But seeing as you misunderstood my meal like that,

425
00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:19.510
I don't know what to say.

426
00:26:20.862 --> 00:26:22.110
I'll get back to work.

427
00:27:00.135 --> 00:27:01.450
It's a nice company.

428
00:27:01.937 --> 00:27:03.600
Do you think we can come here out of the blue like this?

429
00:27:03.605 --> 00:27:05.650
Don't you want to register for the beauty class?

430
00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:07.840
Tae Yang is the only one who can give you the money...

431
00:27:07.843 --> 00:27:09.420
that Mom took away from you.

432
00:27:09.711 --> 00:27:11.110
Do you know which floor he's at?

433
00:27:11.113 --> 00:27:12.230
Wait a moment.

434
00:27:14.416 --> 00:27:16.060
May I help you?

435
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:18.550
Where's the Menu Research and Development Team?

436
00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:19.630
Wait a moment.

437
00:27:24.092 --> 00:27:25.140
Wait.

438
00:27:26.628 --> 00:27:28.680
Why is she here?

439
00:27:34.202 --> 00:27:35.380
Eun Byul.

440
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.620
Grandmother?

441
00:27:40.108 --> 00:27:42.590
You shouldn't call me that outside.

442
00:27:44.212 --> 00:27:45.490
It's been a while.

443
00:27:46.148 --> 00:27:48.930
Why did you come here?

444
00:27:49.317 --> 00:27:51.730
Did you come here to see me?

445
00:27:55.524 --> 00:27:58.860
Gosh, I'm so angry. I'm so angry.

446
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.170
He must be out of his mind.

447
00:28:01.329 --> 00:28:04.060
I spent so much on his Judo classes.

448
00:28:04.066 --> 00:28:06.960
I spent all my money that I earned from the dance classes I taught...

449
00:28:06.968 --> 00:28:09.830
from 6am every morning. I taught 3 classes every day...

450
00:28:09.838 --> 00:28:11.330
for seven years!

451
00:28:11.339 --> 00:28:13.920
If I had saved that money, I could have built a building!

452
00:28:14.142 --> 00:28:15.890
You're exaggerating.

453
00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:18.130
Are you teasing me?

454
00:28:18.747 --> 00:28:19.860
No.

455
00:28:20.415 --> 00:28:23.310
I'm so upset because I feel like I wasn't a good father to him.

456
00:28:23.318 --> 00:28:25.420
He didn't tell me that he didn't want to do it.

457
00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.100
If I were his biological father,

458
00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:29.400
he would have told me.

459
00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:33.820
You are the best dad ever. He's the bad one.

460
00:28:33.829 --> 00:28:36.930
What is he going to do in Korea without even graduating college?

461
00:28:36.932 --> 00:28:39.750
If he can't study well, he should at least play sports.

462
00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:41.520
You're so weird.

463
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.430
You act normally most of the time,

464
00:28:43.438 --> 00:28:44.670
but you change whenever you talk about your son.

465
00:28:44.673 --> 00:28:45.700
What did I do?

466
00:28:45.707 --> 00:28:47.170
You look like a different person.

467
00:28:47.175 --> 00:28:49.070
On the outside, you look like you're open-minded.

468
00:28:49.077 --> 00:28:51.120
But when it comes to your children, it's like you're from Joseon.

469
00:28:52.047 --> 00:28:54.910
I think he doesn't have to go to college.

470
00:28:54.916 --> 00:28:56.150
In the past, people got nice jobs...

471
00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:58.730
after graduating from college, but it's not like that now.

472
00:28:59.121 --> 00:29:00.920
Whether it is makeup or farming that he wants to do...

473
00:29:00.922 --> 00:29:02.900
in his life, the important thing is that he's happy.

474
00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:04.370
Would you say the same thing...

475
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.010
if it had been Eun Byul?

476
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.530
What do you mean?

477
00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:11.480
I'm disappointed.

478
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.250
Maybe it's because he's not your son.

479
00:29:14.436 --> 00:29:16.780
I'm the one who's disappointed.

480
00:29:16.872 --> 00:29:20.200
I've never treated Woo Joo as if he weren't my real son.

481
00:29:20.208 --> 00:29:21.920
Then it must be the generation gap.

482
00:29:22.077 --> 00:29:23.860
This is why I didn't date younger men.

483
00:29:24.112 --> 00:29:25.640
Oh, is that so?

484
00:29:25.647 --> 00:29:29.150
You must be so happy that you're so old, ma'am.

485
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:31.570
Yes, I'm old! So what?

486
00:29:33.221 --> 00:29:36.350
Gosh. But still...

487
00:29:36.358 --> 00:29:39.170
But still, he shouldn't drop out of high school.

488
00:29:45.534 --> 00:29:48.420
So you fought with your mom?

489
00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:51.990
Yes, she took all our money.

490
00:29:52.207 --> 00:29:53.400
Stop it.

491
00:29:53.408 --> 00:29:55.920
It's all right. I'm your grandmother.

492
00:29:56.211 --> 00:29:58.660
Can I ask you something?

493
00:29:59.614 --> 00:30:01.930
Why are you on such bad terms with Dad?

494
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:03.460
I don't know.

495
00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:07.900
Just like you fought with your mom,

496
00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:11.910
I fought with your dad too, and this is what happened.

497
00:30:13.228 --> 00:30:16.430
That is why I want to ask you to help me.

498
00:30:16.431 --> 00:30:17.640
How?

499
00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:19.760
I want to make up to your father...

500
00:30:19.768 --> 00:30:22.330
in secret and be on good terms again.

501
00:30:22.337 --> 00:30:23.870
But I need your help.

502
00:30:23.872 --> 00:30:24.870
What kind of help?

503
00:30:24.873 --> 00:30:28.150
Your brother, Jung Tae Yang, is my employee.

504
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.630
For him to get promoted, we need to know about his family.

505
00:30:32.113 --> 00:30:34.430
But we don't know anything about his real dad.

506
00:30:35.116 --> 00:30:37.430
Did you hear anything about him?

507
00:30:37.719 --> 00:30:40.350
Why do you have to know about my brother's dad?

508
00:30:40.355 --> 00:30:43.570
If something bad about him comes up, I need to cover it for him.

509
00:30:44.793 --> 00:30:47.940
We don't know anything about him.

510
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.380
Think carefully.

511
00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:54.610
Didn't your mom mention anything?

512
00:30:57.873 --> 00:30:59.570
Yes, the necklace.

513
00:30:59.574 --> 00:31:00.720
The necklace?

514
00:31:00.809 --> 00:31:01.960
A necklace?

515
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:04.090
What necklace?

516
00:31:04.346 --> 00:31:07.010
Mom has an old necklace...

517
00:31:07.015 --> 00:31:09.900
that has a photo of someone that resembles Tae Yang.

518
00:31:11.419 --> 00:31:12.530
Really?

519
00:31:13.288 --> 00:31:17.100
Can I see that photo?

520
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.370
Mom wouldn't like that.

521
00:31:22.497 --> 00:31:25.150
We'll keep it a secret.

522
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.910
Can you do that?

523
00:31:29.771 --> 00:31:31.520
It's for your brother.

524
00:31:32.207 --> 00:31:35.610
And if you do that, I can get you registered...

525
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.090
to the beauty class that you want to attend.

526
00:31:41.616 --> 00:31:44.660
All right. I'll get it for you.

527
00:31:57.565 --> 00:31:59.210
Are you all right, Mom?

528
00:32:05.941 --> 00:32:07.120
What should I do?

529
00:32:08.043 --> 00:32:10.260
You couldn't go to work because of me.

530
00:32:11.513 --> 00:32:12.830
It's all right.

531
00:32:14.849 --> 00:32:17.760
Do you remember fainting yesterday?

532
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.430
Fainting?

533
00:32:23.858 --> 00:32:26.620
Sue me? You think that's easy?

534
00:32:26.628 --> 00:32:29.330
It could take up to 3, 4,

535
00:32:29.331 --> 00:32:30.680
or even five years.

536
00:32:30.832 --> 00:32:33.830
If you want to be a divorced woman even when you're old,

537
00:32:33.835 --> 00:32:35.820
go ahead.

538
00:32:44.579 --> 00:32:47.630
I'm sorry, Mom. I couldn't leave her behind.

539
00:32:51.886 --> 00:32:54.270
Give this to her.

540
00:32:54.356 --> 00:32:56.690
You're the sick one.

541
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:57.790
It's all right.

542
00:32:57.792 --> 00:32:58.910
It's fine.

543
00:32:59.461 --> 00:33:01.370
She didn't do anything wrong.

544
00:33:01.963 --> 00:33:03.440
She's still a little girl.

545
00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:07.880
She must've suffered among strangers. Here.

546
00:33:15.477 --> 00:33:17.220
We're no strangers to her.

547
00:33:17.812 --> 00:33:20.190
She probably met Dad from time to time.

548
00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:24.660
How old is she?

549
00:33:25.587 --> 00:33:28.100
I don't know. I don't want to know.

550
00:33:29.324 --> 00:33:30.740
I'm an idiot.

551
00:33:32.227 --> 00:33:34.010
She looks like 4 or 5.

552
00:33:34.896 --> 00:33:36.930
How did I not know?

553
00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:38.710
You're not an idiot.

554
00:33:38.867 --> 00:33:42.180
Dad is a betrayer and a swindler who deceived us.

555
00:33:42.971 --> 00:33:45.390
I can never forgive him.

556
00:33:45.807 --> 00:33:48.760
I get angrier and grossed out the more I think about it.

557
00:33:49.377 --> 00:33:50.660
What's this?

558
00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:52.780
Your life, my life,

559
00:33:52.781 --> 00:33:54.160
her mom's life,

560
00:33:54.349 --> 00:33:55.930
and her life.

561
00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:00.770
How is Dad going to pay for his sin?

562
00:34:04.826 --> 00:34:09.340
I always trusted Dad even though he only yelled at me all the time.

563
00:34:10.031 --> 00:34:12.530
Unlike other men who cheat on their wives,

564
00:34:12.534 --> 00:34:15.010
I thought he loved us to death.

565
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:18.550
- Ru Ri. - But that was all a lie.

566
00:34:19.207 --> 00:34:21.690
He never cared about us.

567
00:34:22.277 --> 00:34:25.560
He's a selfish man who only thinks about himself.

568
00:34:26.181 --> 00:34:27.960
Ru Ri. Come sit here.

569
00:34:44.466 --> 00:34:46.610
It makes me more upset when I see you.

570
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:53.450
I'm getting punished for making a wrong choice.

571
00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:55.890
But why do you have to suffer?

572
00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:00.090
What's wrong with your dad?

573
00:35:10.892 --> 00:35:12.070
You're up.

574
00:35:14.762 --> 00:35:16.940
See?

575
00:35:17.132 --> 00:35:20.110
I told you you'll feel better after a nap.

576
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.120
How do you feel?

577
00:35:23.638 --> 00:35:26.150
I'm okay now.

578
00:35:27.609 --> 00:35:29.320
Let me check.

579
00:35:31.279 --> 00:35:32.460
Okay.

580
00:35:33.548 --> 00:35:35.230
- Does it hurt? - Yes.

581
00:35:36.184 --> 00:35:38.260
- Here too? - Yes.

582
00:35:41.156 --> 00:35:42.700
My guess was right.

583
00:35:43.057 --> 00:35:44.300
Let's begin the examination.

584
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:48.070
Follow me, please.

585
00:35:51.299 --> 00:35:52.660
What kind of examination is it?

586
00:35:52.667 --> 00:35:54.680
What? Oh, it's nothing big.

587
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.350
It's a mental health test.

588
00:35:57.472 --> 00:35:58.740
You know.

589
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.600
It's one of the things you do when you visit hospitals.

590
00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:02.890
Let's go.

591
00:36:13.087 --> 00:36:16.400
Hey, Ru Ri. You're distracting.

592
00:36:16.558 --> 00:36:19.440
Take the youngest one, and go home.

593
00:36:26.201 --> 00:36:27.350
The youngest one?

594
00:36:48.156 --> 00:36:50.440
This is for beef sashimi.

595
00:36:52.093 --> 00:36:54.990
- Also, make sure to cook a lot. - Yes.

596
00:36:54.996 --> 00:36:58.710
Try to avoid using pepper powder for the little kid.

597
00:36:58.766 --> 00:37:00.010
Yes, ma'am.

598
00:37:01.569 --> 00:37:03.020
What's all this, Mom?

599
00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:05.290
Is it Dad's ritual today?

600
00:37:05.406 --> 00:37:08.690
I know you're my child,

601
00:37:08.776 --> 00:37:11.440
but is your brain a washer or something?

602
00:37:11.446 --> 00:37:15.450
Do you wash your brain clean every day?

603
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.600
This is all going to your in-law's.

604
00:37:18.386 --> 00:37:20.270
All of these? Why?

605
00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:24.590
It's obvious that your mother-in-law's in bed.

606
00:37:24.592 --> 00:37:26.770
Who else is going to do all the house chores?

607
00:37:26.828 --> 00:37:29.710
If her only daughter-in-law...

608
00:37:29.931 --> 00:37:32.350
go comfort her now,

609
00:37:32.367 --> 00:37:36.370
Dr. Lee will appreciate it so much.

610
00:37:36.371 --> 00:37:40.390
I'll wrap them up for you. Just take them to their house.

611
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:43.520
But I'm scared.

612
00:38:08.036 --> 00:38:09.250
It's me, Father.

613
00:38:10.038 --> 00:38:11.780
How's Mom?

614
00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:15.890
Oh, I worked it out as you can imagine.

615
00:38:16.778 --> 00:38:18.290
You worked it out?

616
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.940
What do you mean?

617
00:38:19.947 --> 00:38:21.780
I told you.

618
00:38:21.783 --> 00:38:24.430
Your mom listens to whatever I tell her.

619
00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:27.630
She's a bit upset and angry,

620
00:38:27.955 --> 00:38:30.000
but she'll take good care of Han Gyul.

621
00:38:32.593 --> 00:38:36.640
Father. I think I'm shameless.

622
00:38:37.198 --> 00:38:39.700
I should tell Mom the truth...

623
00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:41.680
Truth, my foot.

624
00:38:42.136 --> 00:38:43.920
Don't even come home for a while.

625
00:38:44.138 --> 00:38:45.450
Father.

626
00:38:45.606 --> 00:38:47.820
Just listen to what I tell you to do.

627
00:38:48.609 --> 00:38:53.560
From now on, the truth is that Han Gyul's my daughter for good.

628
00:38:53.915 --> 00:38:56.660
You're going to be her brother.

629
00:39:04.592 --> 00:39:05.710
Gosh.

630
00:39:14.469 --> 00:39:17.250
You'll get an upset stomach. Slow down.

631
00:39:18.373 --> 00:39:20.050
Here. Drink water.

632
00:39:26.447 --> 00:39:28.440
Why would you spill?

633
00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:29.600
Here.

634
00:39:32.186 --> 00:39:33.430
You spilled too much.

635
00:39:34.088 --> 00:39:35.200
Let's get you changed.

636
00:39:37.258 --> 00:39:38.400
What's wrong?

637
00:39:39.861 --> 00:39:40.970
Are you embarrassed?

638
00:39:41.362 --> 00:39:42.890
You have no other choice.

639
00:39:42.897 --> 00:39:44.510
Take it off before you catch cold.

640
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:48.610
My goodness.

641
00:39:49.337 --> 00:39:50.620
What's wrong?

642
00:39:51.973 --> 00:39:53.290
Do you have something inside?

643
00:39:55.009 --> 00:39:57.460
It's fine. Tell me. What is it?

644
00:40:00.681 --> 00:40:02.260
Okay. Fine.

645
00:40:02.917 --> 00:40:06.500
I'll put it back after you get changed.

646
00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:12.470
What is it? What do you have?

647
00:40:20.968 --> 00:40:24.020
(Salute! Lieutenant Lee So Won from Seoul Hospital)

648
00:40:26.507 --> 00:40:28.720
Han Gyul. Han Gyul.

649
00:40:29.243 --> 00:40:31.020
Why do you have this?

650
00:40:34.882 --> 00:40:37.930
It's fine. Tell me. What's this picture?

651
00:40:38.386 --> 00:40:43.300
Dad. He's my dad. Dad.

652
00:40:49.263 --> 00:40:51.340
It's typical repressed anger.

653
00:40:52.033 --> 00:40:53.310
Repressed anger?

654
00:40:54.202 --> 00:40:56.870
So her body is healthy,

655
00:40:56.871 --> 00:41:00.050
but she has anger in her heart?

656
00:41:00.508 --> 00:41:03.460
If you neglect it, you could get a serious disease.

657
00:41:03.978 --> 00:41:07.860
From high blood pressure to diabetes, angina, and even dementia.

658
00:41:09.917 --> 00:41:12.500
Your wife is in a very serious condition.

659
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.270
Anger piled up for a long time...

660
00:41:15.323 --> 00:41:18.390
that she has stress rashes, and she has been taking digestive medicine.

661
00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:19.920
Did you know that?

662
00:41:19.927 --> 00:41:20.970
Pardon?

663
00:41:21.863 --> 00:41:25.850
No. I thought she was exaggerating.

664
00:41:28.736 --> 00:41:32.390
The most important part in treatment is the family's cooperation.

665
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.890
What do you say to...

666
00:41:34.008 --> 00:41:37.960
taking a couple counseling treatment together?

667
00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:47.100
How do I do that?

668
00:41:58.699 --> 00:42:01.580
Ru Ri. What are you doing here?

669
00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:08.520
Did you know Mom was taken to the hospital last night?

670
00:42:08.576 --> 00:42:11.160
What? Why?

671
00:42:11.345 --> 00:42:12.690
Because she fainted.

672
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.360
Dad brought a kid home and told her to raise her.

673
00:42:20.221 --> 00:42:23.440
Don't you want to know who the kid is?

674
00:42:23.824 --> 00:42:26.360
I know. I've seen her before.

675
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.770
I'm sure you have.

676
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.740
What are you saying?

677
00:42:37.905 --> 00:42:39.150
Where did you get this?

678
00:42:39.307 --> 00:42:40.950
That kid had it.

679
00:42:41.342 --> 00:42:44.190
She said it's her dad. She kept it in her pocket.

680
00:42:47.782 --> 00:42:48.960
Tell me the truth.

681
00:42:50.318 --> 00:42:51.530
Is she your child?

682
00:42:54.055 --> 00:42:56.040
Answer me! Is she your child?

683
00:43:01.128 --> 00:43:02.240
Yes.

684
00:43:04.198 --> 00:43:07.210
Han Gyul is my child.

685
00:43:10.037 --> 00:43:12.840
Are you out of your mind? How can you...

686
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.720
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

687
00:43:16.277 --> 00:43:19.690
But I didn't hide it to avoid taking responsibility.

688
00:43:20.047 --> 00:43:21.280
And it's not what you think.

689
00:43:21.282 --> 00:43:23.430
I didn't cheat on Yeon Ju.

690
00:43:24.118 --> 00:43:27.820
I did what Father told me to do to protect my family.

691
00:43:27.822 --> 00:43:29.750
Your family needs to be protected,

692
00:43:29.757 --> 00:43:32.150
but our family doesn't?

693
00:43:32.159 --> 00:43:35.420
You pretend to be so clever and great,

694
00:43:35.429 --> 00:43:37.490
and yet whatever Dad tells you to do, you listen to him...

695
00:43:37.498 --> 00:43:39.030
even if it doesn't make any sense?

696
00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:40.860
I told you it's not like that.

697
00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:42.430
It happened so suddenly.

698
00:43:42.436 --> 00:43:44.280
I don't want to listen to your excuses.

699
00:43:45.072 --> 00:43:47.000
You caused Mom to faint...

700
00:43:47.008 --> 00:43:49.670
so that you can live your life. Isn't that what happened?

701
00:43:49.677 --> 00:43:50.820
Lee Ru Ri.

702
00:43:54.181 --> 00:43:55.760
I don't want to do this any longer.

703
00:43:56.117 --> 00:43:59.320
If you have any conscience left, tell everyone...

704
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.540
that that girl is your child, not your sister.

705
00:44:06.661 --> 00:44:10.440
How can you be so much like Dad?

706
00:44:10.931 --> 00:44:13.410
Is that what clever people who went to a good university are like?

707
00:44:15.136 --> 00:44:16.800
You are a selfish person...

708
00:44:16.804 --> 00:44:19.240
who only thinks of yourself no matter what happens to others.

709
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.170
That's too harsh. No one got hurt because of this.

710
00:44:22.176 --> 00:44:24.820
Mom and Dad are going to get divorced soon.

711
00:44:26.514 --> 00:44:28.330
I beg you.

712
00:44:28.816 --> 00:44:32.330
Please get your act together from now on, okay?

713
00:44:37.391 --> 00:44:38.700
Come inside.

714
00:44:47.201 --> 00:44:50.230
Hey, you can't just bring her here.

715
00:44:50.237 --> 00:44:51.350
Han Gyul,

716
00:44:51.639 --> 00:44:54.390
stay next to him at all times, okay?

717
00:44:57.578 --> 00:44:59.390
He's your real dad.

718
00:45:38.385 --> 00:45:40.130
It's going to be so fun.

719
00:45:44.391 --> 00:45:48.310
Why did this happen to my family?

720
00:46:00.341 --> 00:46:01.550
Manager Jung.

721
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:03.560
Why is your voice like that?

722
00:46:04.278 --> 00:46:05.590
Didn't you have dinner?

723
00:46:05.679 --> 00:46:06.990
It's not that.

724
00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:11.110
You must have been so busy all day because of me.

725
00:46:11.118 --> 00:46:13.380
Who did all the cleaning up and chores today?

726
00:46:13.387 --> 00:46:15.380
I told you not to worry about it.

727
00:46:15.389 --> 00:46:17.400
Substitute workers came and cleaned up the kitchen.

728
00:46:18.259 --> 00:46:20.270
Are you home then?

729
00:46:20.427 --> 00:46:22.710
Of course, I came home ages ago.

730
00:46:23.197 --> 00:46:26.250
Why? Should I go there?

731
00:46:26.567 --> 00:46:27.630
Where are you?

732
00:46:27.635 --> 00:46:29.110
No, you don't need to.

733
00:46:29.637 --> 00:46:31.730
You must be tired. Get some rest.

734
00:46:31.739 --> 00:46:33.190
I'm home too.

735
00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.220
I'll see you tomorrow.

736
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:43.730
I really don't want to go home.

737
00:46:46.587 --> 00:46:48.130
Where should I go?

738
00:46:51.458 --> 00:46:53.970
She could be crying somewhere by herself.

739
00:47:11.412 --> 00:47:12.930
Who's here at this hour?

740
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.810
Substitute workers came and cleaned up the kitchen.

741
00:47:33.367 --> 00:47:34.510
Ru Ri.

742
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.280
You said you were home. Why did you come here?

743
00:47:42.676 --> 00:47:44.960
What is it? Did something happen?

744
00:48:18.178 --> 00:48:19.430
Don't cry.

745
00:48:40.301 --> 00:48:41.410
Are you done crying?

746
00:48:43.237 --> 00:48:44.280
Here.

747
00:48:45.072 --> 00:48:46.690
It's hot cocoa.

748
00:48:47.741 --> 00:48:50.020
You should drink something after crying so much.

749
00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.960
I really don't want to go home tonight.

750
00:48:58.819 --> 00:49:01.330
Do you know what that means?

751
00:49:03.991 --> 00:49:06.470
"I don't want to go home today."

752
00:49:08.262 --> 00:49:10.540
Do you know how dangerous it is to say that?

753
00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:13.910
Don't say that to anyone else.

754
00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:15.850
You can only say that to me.

755
00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:19.890
But I mean it. I don't want to go home.

756
00:49:21.608 --> 00:49:24.320
I hate my selfish brother who only thinks of himself,

757
00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:29.560
I hate my mom who just lives with all this,

758
00:49:31.185 --> 00:49:33.480
and I hate myself for not being able to do anything.

759
00:49:33.487 --> 00:49:36.540
I just hate all my family members.

760
00:49:39.927 --> 00:49:42.410
Do you know how my second father...

761
00:49:43.097 --> 00:49:44.340
was like?

762
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.250
He was a police officer...

763
00:49:49.136 --> 00:49:50.880
who was crazy about gambling.

764
00:49:51.905 --> 00:49:54.690
He'd destroy and hit everything telling us to give him money.

765
00:49:55.676 --> 00:49:56.960
Every time that happened,

766
00:49:58.178 --> 00:49:59.990
I had the exact thoughts.

767
00:50:02.216 --> 00:50:04.500
I hated my father who was a bully,

768
00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:07.430
I hated my mom who just let him do that to her,

769
00:50:07.621 --> 00:50:09.100
and I hated my young self...

770
00:50:10.591 --> 00:50:12.040
for not being able to do anything.

771
00:50:14.328 --> 00:50:15.470
Chef Jung.

772
00:50:17.297 --> 00:50:19.010
That's why I decided...

773
00:50:20.567 --> 00:50:23.020
that I won't get married in the future.

774
00:50:24.972 --> 00:50:28.390
I decided not to have fantasies about families.

775
00:50:30.577 --> 00:50:31.620
Me too.

776
00:50:33.347 --> 00:50:35.380
Who would want to get married...

777
00:50:35.382 --> 00:50:37.430
if it feels like falling into the abyss?

778
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:42.630
But there's something...

779
00:50:43.724 --> 00:50:44.940
I realized recently.

780
00:50:46.427 --> 00:50:49.840
Marriage is not the problem. Who you marry is more important.

781
00:50:50.597 --> 00:50:52.580
And if you meet a good person,

782
00:50:52.699 --> 00:50:54.750
marriage could also be a blessing.

783
00:50:57.071 --> 00:50:58.680
So don't lose hope.

784
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.050
Your parents' lives are their lives.

785
00:51:03.377 --> 00:51:06.060
Our lives are ours to live.

786
00:51:08.048 --> 00:51:09.090
Right?

787
00:51:14.455 --> 00:51:15.530
Here.

788
00:51:45.586 --> 00:51:47.130
Where did you put the medicine?

789
00:51:50.757 --> 00:51:52.040
If you're worried about...

790
00:51:52.392 --> 00:51:55.670
what the doctor said at the hospital, don't worry about it.

791
00:51:56.196 --> 00:52:00.010
I won't attend a couple counseling program with you.

792
00:52:02.703 --> 00:52:05.950
I was shocked by what the doctor said.

793
00:52:08.008 --> 00:52:09.790
I feel disappointed in myself...

794
00:52:11.078 --> 00:52:13.090
for not being able to protect my wife...

795
00:52:13.847 --> 00:52:14.990
and making you suffer.

796
00:52:16.416 --> 00:52:18.630
I know this sounds like an excuse,

797
00:52:19.686 --> 00:52:21.030
but I really had no idea.

798
00:52:21.822 --> 00:52:23.820
I didn't know you were...

799
00:52:23.824 --> 00:52:26.270
so stressed out while living with me.

800
00:52:28.762 --> 00:52:31.740
Yes, I'm patriarchal.

801
00:52:32.366 --> 00:52:36.250
I was born in a patriarchal family, educated to be patriarchal,

802
00:52:36.336 --> 00:52:39.950
and I lived in a patriarchal era. I can't help it.

803
00:52:41.842 --> 00:52:42.960
But you knew this...

804
00:52:43.677 --> 00:52:45.990
when you married me.

805
00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:49.760
When people get old,

806
00:52:50.784 --> 00:52:53.230
it's hard for them to change their personalities.

807
00:52:54.087 --> 00:52:55.130
Especially...

808
00:52:55.956 --> 00:52:58.000
for men like me, who are...

809
00:52:58.358 --> 00:53:01.140
self-assertive and full of pride.

810
00:53:04.298 --> 00:53:06.080
What do you want to tell me?

811
00:53:06.166 --> 00:53:08.680
For our relationship to get better,

812
00:53:09.469 --> 00:53:11.120
I need to change you.

813
00:53:12.072 --> 00:53:15.290
Since you're gentle and obedient,

814
00:53:15.509 --> 00:53:16.920
it's easier to fix you.

815
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.960
If you have any complaints, tell me.

816
00:53:21.181 --> 00:53:23.160
Tell me what you like and what you don't like.

817
00:53:23.717 --> 00:53:27.380
Don't keep it inside you. Just tell me.

818
00:53:27.387 --> 00:53:29.500
Then I'll know how you feel.

819
00:53:31.758 --> 00:53:34.640
I told you before.

820
00:53:35.095 --> 00:53:37.140
There's something wrong with your personality.

821
00:53:37.998 --> 00:53:42.380
When you're angry, you don't talk about it like I do.

822
00:53:42.836 --> 00:53:46.650
You keep it inside you and not talk for days.

823
00:53:46.807 --> 00:53:49.220
It also suffocated me to put up with it.

824
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:54.460
Let's take this chance to fix your habit of not talking.

825
00:53:54.781 --> 00:53:57.310
Let's open everything,

826
00:53:57.317 --> 00:54:00.370
and talk more, communicate more,

827
00:54:00.554 --> 00:54:02.480
and get rid of...

828
00:54:02.489 --> 00:54:05.700
the repressed anger you have.

829
00:54:05.926 --> 00:54:07.140
Understand?

830
00:54:09.396 --> 00:54:11.760
My goodness. See?

831
00:54:11.765 --> 00:54:14.810
You're not responding again.

832
00:54:14.868 --> 00:54:19.450
I'm talking to you. Say something.

833
00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.790
Do you get it or not?

834
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:26.060
Answer me. Do you understand?

835
00:54:27.948 --> 00:54:29.490
What nonsense.

836
00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:32.760
What? What did you just say?

837
00:54:33.487 --> 00:54:34.870
I said that's nonsense.

838
00:54:35.822 --> 00:54:37.200
Hey, Hong Young Hye.

839
00:54:37.724 --> 00:54:39.250
Did you say there's something wrong with my personality?

840
00:54:39.259 --> 00:54:40.940
That I need to change it?

841
00:54:41.395 --> 00:54:44.260
So we should talk more and communicate more?

842
00:54:44.264 --> 00:54:46.960
Hey, if that was possible,

843
00:54:46.967 --> 00:54:49.080
this would've never happened.

844
00:54:49.936 --> 00:54:52.450
You always yell at me when I say something.

845
00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:55.300
If I say you're wrong, you say I don't know anything.

846
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:57.890
You never respected me, and told me I'm stupid.

847
00:54:58.912 --> 00:55:03.050
Is that your meaning of communication?

848
00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:06.580
Hey, Hong Young Hye. I mean, Mrs. Hong. What are you...

849
00:55:06.586 --> 00:55:07.930
There's no need to talk.

850
00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:11.500
I'll get a new court date. Let's get divorced.

851
00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:15.140
That's the only thing I can do with you.

852
00:55:16.196 --> 00:55:18.980
Hey, Hong Young Hye. Hong Young Hye.

853
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:25.950
What's wrong with her?

854
00:55:26.073 --> 00:55:29.970
I'm talking with sincerity,

855
00:55:29.976 --> 00:55:33.440
but she never understands.

856
00:55:33.447 --> 00:55:36.260
This is why we can never have a conversation.

857
00:55:52.566 --> 00:55:53.910
It's delicious.

858
00:56:19.926 --> 00:56:21.970
Mommy is the best.

859
00:56:22.195 --> 00:56:24.340
I should comfort Mother with these.

860
00:56:26.199 --> 00:56:27.680
It's my honey.

861
00:56:28.835 --> 00:56:31.920
Honey. I was about to call you.

862
00:56:32.205 --> 00:56:33.340
Where are you?

863
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.000
I'm on the way to comfort Mother.

864
00:56:36.009 --> 00:56:37.660
Come over, so we can have dinner together.

865
00:56:38.078 --> 00:56:42.160
That's good. I have something to tell you. I'll meet you there.

866
00:56:42.382 --> 00:56:45.100
Okay, honey. I love you.

867
00:56:49.756 --> 00:56:51.100
He has something to tell me?

868
00:56:52.859 --> 00:56:54.070
I wonder what it is.

869
00:57:01.134 --> 00:57:02.680
Welcome.

870
00:57:06.006 --> 00:57:10.220
All the clothes in this store. Everything.

871
00:57:10.277 --> 00:57:12.270
How much would it cost for me to buy everything?

872
00:57:12.279 --> 00:57:14.490
Everything? Is it for yourself?

873
00:57:14.748 --> 00:57:19.030
No. You know "obladi oblada"?

874
00:57:19.085 --> 00:57:21.380
You know how rich people donate to the society...

875
00:57:21.388 --> 00:57:23.820
Oh, you mean noblesse oblige?

876
00:57:23.824 --> 00:57:25.750
Oh, I was confused.

877
00:57:25.759 --> 00:57:28.790
I'm the chairwoman of building owners association,

878
00:57:28.795 --> 00:57:30.990
and I'm going to host a charity.

879
00:57:30.997 --> 00:57:35.110
Call the manager and the owner so I can pay for everything.

880
00:57:35.302 --> 00:57:37.330
Obladi oblada.

881
00:57:37.337 --> 00:57:39.730
Yes. Obladi oblada.

882
00:57:39.739 --> 00:57:40.950
Hold on.

883
00:57:45.145 --> 00:57:46.490
Yes. Dr. Lee.

884
00:57:46.847 --> 00:57:48.730
Please come over to my parents' house now.

885
00:57:49.282 --> 00:57:51.460
I have something to tell you.

886
00:57:51.518 --> 00:57:55.430
Sure. I'll get going right away.

887
00:57:55.755 --> 00:57:57.440
Okay. Okay.

888
00:57:59.359 --> 00:58:02.470
My goodness. It's like a feast.

889
00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:06.410
My mom prepared all this in case you skip the meal.

890
00:58:07.167 --> 00:58:10.280
Mother doesn't even cook because she's upset, does she?

891
00:58:10.337 --> 00:58:13.020
She's totally outraged.

892
00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.550
You're so mean, Father.

893
00:58:15.842 --> 00:58:18.110
Mother must be very angry.

894
00:58:18.111 --> 00:58:20.690
I know. It's all my fault.

895
00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:21.990
I'm sorry.

896
00:58:23.817 --> 00:58:27.270
Hey. Why are you back?

897
00:58:27.487 --> 00:58:29.030
I told you not to come.

898
00:58:29.222 --> 00:58:32.100
He's here to comfort Mother.

899
00:58:32.726 --> 00:58:35.470
Why are you with her, honey?

900
00:58:35.629 --> 00:58:38.140
I have something to tell you. Go bring Mother.

901
00:58:38.198 --> 00:58:39.240
Okay.

902
00:58:39.866 --> 00:58:44.080
Little Sister-in-law, come with me, please. Here.

903
00:58:45.472 --> 00:58:47.390
Let's go.

904
00:58:50.911 --> 00:58:53.460
Hey. What are you trying to say?

905
00:58:53.547 --> 00:58:55.460
You know exactly what I'm going to tell them.

906
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:56.960
What?

907
00:58:57.684 --> 00:59:00.770
You're ruining everything.

908
00:59:01.788 --> 00:59:04.050
Come here. Follow me.

909
00:59:04.057 --> 00:59:06.770
Come here. Come.

910
00:59:13.867 --> 00:59:17.420
Why are you doing this?

911
00:59:18.071 --> 00:59:19.550
It's all done now.

912
00:59:19.606 --> 00:59:21.150
I heard Mom fainted yesterday.

913
00:59:22.409 --> 00:59:24.220
I can't do this anymore as a human.

914
00:59:24.344 --> 00:59:26.990
I've made up my mind. Don't try to stop me anymore.

915
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.590
No. You can never do that.

916
00:59:30.183 --> 00:59:31.210
I won't allow it.

917
00:59:31.217 --> 00:59:33.030
Are you going to divorce Mom then?

918
00:59:33.219 --> 00:59:34.680
Are you going to make me the bad son...

919
00:59:34.688 --> 00:59:36.150
who make my own parents divorce for my sake?

920
00:59:36.156 --> 00:59:39.040
Hey. Quiet down. They'll hear you. Lower your voice.

921
00:59:41.761 --> 00:59:44.310
If it bothers you so much,

922
00:59:45.031 --> 00:59:48.780
I'll tell your mom only.

923
00:59:48.935 --> 00:59:51.230
If she finds out Han Gyul's your child,

924
00:59:51.237 --> 00:59:53.400
she wouldn't talk about divorce anymore.

925
00:59:53.406 --> 00:59:54.750
Please stop.

926
00:59:55.775 --> 00:59:57.060
It's over now.

927
00:59:57.978 --> 01:00:00.330
Hey, So Won. So Won.

928
01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.060
Hey, So Won.

929
01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:04.360
Hey.

930
01:00:04.551 --> 01:00:07.230
Hey. Hey, So Won.

931
01:00:07.587 --> 01:00:08.770
You're making a mistake.

932
01:00:08.989 --> 01:00:10.450
You're going to regret for the rest of your life.

933
01:00:10.457 --> 01:00:12.420
Let me go, Father.

934
01:00:12.425 --> 01:00:13.570
Honey.

935
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:19.340
Mother said she won't eat.

936
01:00:20.266 --> 01:00:22.010
What's wrong, Father?

937
01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:24.620
No. It's nothing.

938
01:00:25.305 --> 01:00:26.450
Don't worry about it.

939
01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.220
- Follow me. - What?

940
01:00:30.677 --> 01:00:34.690
Hey, So Won. So Won. So Won.

941
01:00:56.936 --> 01:00:58.120
What's going on?

942
01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:03.420
He said he has something to tell us.

943
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:07.960
If you're trying to stop me from divorcing,

944
01:01:08.682 --> 01:01:09.860
just leave.

945
01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.470
Honey.

946
01:01:22.495 --> 01:01:23.680
I'm sorry, Mom.

947
01:01:27.801 --> 01:01:29.110
It's all my fault...

948
01:01:30.203 --> 01:01:31.380
for making you like this.

949
01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:35.120
What do you mean? You didn't do anything.

950
01:01:39.145 --> 01:01:40.730
What is it, Honey?

951
01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.160
I can't wait. Just say it.

952
01:01:46.052 --> 01:01:47.230
Don't be surprised.

953
01:01:48.188 --> 01:01:49.400
It's about Han Gyul.

954
01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:52.040
Yes, what about Han Gyul?

955
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.970
Well...

956
01:01:55.995 --> 01:01:58.840
No. Don't say it.

957
01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:02.080
Why would you stop him from talking? What is it?

958
01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:04.230
It's nothing.

959
01:02:04.237 --> 01:02:07.450
- Hey, So Won. Let's go out. - Stop it, Father!

960
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:12.060
Han Gyul is my daughter.

961
01:02:13.913 --> 01:02:15.090
What?

962
01:02:17.217 --> 01:02:18.460
What did you say?

963
01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.030
Honey.

964
01:02:21.387 --> 01:02:25.150
Hey. Are you drunk? That doesn't make sense.

965
01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:26.670
Come here. Come.

966
01:02:26.893 --> 01:02:28.170
I lied.

967
01:02:29.195 --> 01:02:30.540
She's not my sister.

968
01:02:32.298 --> 01:02:33.480
She's my daughter.

969
01:02:36.569 --> 01:02:38.520
Daughter?

970
01:02:41.808 --> 01:02:42.950
Yeon Ju.

971
01:02:44.677 --> 01:02:45.890
Yeon Ju.

972
01:02:50.884 --> 01:02:54.100
Are you serious?

973
01:02:54.487 --> 01:02:58.140
Is the child outside...

974
01:02:59.659 --> 01:03:02.170
really your daughter? For real?

975
01:03:05.298 --> 01:03:06.910
Tell me now!

976
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:12.280
I'm sorry.

977
01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:34.970
(Man Who Sets the Table)

978
01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:37.030
You know the youngest sister-in-law?

979
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:39.290
He's your brother.

980
01:03:39.299 --> 01:03:40.960
No. He's my dad.

981
01:03:40.967 --> 01:03:42.930
I'll practice every day after work.

982
01:03:42.936 --> 01:03:44.570
Only the regular employees can stay until late.

983
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.840
I'll lend you this. Just don't get caught.

984
01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.870
You can never find a new recipe like this.

985
01:03:48.875 --> 01:03:50.670
Copy Jung Tae Yang's.

986
01:03:50.677 --> 01:03:51.770
If you bring the necklace,

987
01:03:51.778 --> 01:03:54.380
I can pay for your beauty classes.

988
01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.280
Where did I see her?

989
01:03:56.282 --> 01:03:57.860
I found the necklace.
