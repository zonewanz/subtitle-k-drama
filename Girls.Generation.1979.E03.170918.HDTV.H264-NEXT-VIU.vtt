1
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:13.302
Jung Hee, are you all right?

2
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:14.831
Jung Hee, are you okay?

3
00:00:15.302 --> 00:00:17.001
I was thinking of visiting the hospital.

4
00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:19.372
Look at all that sweat.

5
00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:21.442
Jin.

6
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:24.811
Yes?

7
00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:26.352
Are...

8
00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:30.021
Are you two...

9
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:33.591
I'm too scared to ask if they're dating.

10
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:37.391
Since you couldn't come, Hae Joo took your spot.

11
00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:39.531
We were just talking about...

12
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.031
the show today.

13
00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:49.572
This?

14
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:52.942
This is to celebrate the broadcasting show.

15
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:56.072
Jung Hee.

16
00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:59.082
- It's not like that... - Jung Hee!

17
00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:01.512
Why did you run away like that?

18
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:03.482
What happened, Jung Hee?

19
00:01:03.982 --> 00:01:05.852
- Jung Hee! - Jung Hee!

20
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.792
- Wake up! - Gosh...

21
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:10.262
Why did you faint there?

22
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:12.061
- Jung Hee! - Hae Joo.

23
00:01:19.732 --> 00:01:22.301
I better get going then.

24
00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:25.902
Those weren't for Jung Hee.

25
00:01:26.572 --> 00:01:28.941
We weren't talking about the broadcasting show.

26
00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:32.982
She's sick. I felt bad telling her the truth.

27
00:01:34.182 --> 00:01:35.852
It would have hurt her feelings.

28
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:44.162
That girl... I'll disown her.

29
00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:45.891
Is she trying to drive me crazy?

30
00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:48.591
Has she lost her mind from drinking so much water?

31
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.902
Why did she run off there?

32
00:01:51.902 --> 00:01:54.372
She pulled out the expensive IV.

33
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:56.201
You know how much...

34
00:01:56.272 --> 00:01:59.402
Jung Hee looked forward to the show.

35
00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:02.212
- She was probably upset. - What a fool.

36
00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:04.712
It's just a broadcasting show.

37
00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:06.451
It's not like it's her wedding day.

38
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.812
Why would she wait for such a stupid thing?

39
00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:11.252
Keep it down. She needs rest.

40
00:02:11.252 --> 00:02:12.282
Okay, I will.

41
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:14.252
Get out.

42
00:02:15.092 --> 00:02:16.891
- Okay. - Now!

43
00:02:19.162 --> 00:02:20.431
Girls, wait outside.

44
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:21.991
Go on.

45
00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:25.532
They say if you have bad luck in marriage,

46
00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:28.072
you'd have bad luck with your children.

47
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:29.572
So that's what happened.

48
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:32.002
I didn't know...

49
00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:34.472
Jung Hee liked Jin so much.

50
00:02:34.472 --> 00:02:36.072
Yes. Jung Hee...

51
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:39.912
was really getting on with Jin, you know.

52
00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:42.852
You have no idea how much she waited for the show.

53
00:02:42.852 --> 00:02:43.951
Right.

54
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:47.252
She was so happy that all of the city...

55
00:02:47.252 --> 00:02:49.762
would see her as Jin's girl.

56
00:02:49.762 --> 00:02:53.461
This is all because of Shim Ae Sook.

57
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:54.562
I agree.

58
00:02:54.562 --> 00:02:56.032
Shim Ae Sook?

59
00:02:58.732 --> 00:03:02.701
Are you saying Jung Hee didn't just fall in?

60
00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:06.472
Did this Shim Ae Sook girl push her in the water?

61
00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:08.641
Well...

62
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:09.641
Well?

63
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:14.752
Is Ae Sook the daughter of the pub at the market?

64
00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:18.051
Isn't she the daughter of the woman...

65
00:03:18.051 --> 00:03:19.451
that flirts with every man?

66
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.121
Please, the kids are here.

67
00:03:21.121 --> 00:03:22.861
I don't care.

68
00:03:22.861 --> 00:03:26.062
It's not for sure if Ae Sook did it.

69
00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:29.192
It's just an assumption.

70
00:03:29.192 --> 00:03:31.562
- An assumption? - Yes, that's right.

71
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.002
Fine. I'll wait until sunrise.

72
00:03:36.301 --> 00:03:38.141
You girls.

73
00:03:38.472 --> 00:03:41.271
I'll interrogate all of you.

74
00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:44.782
I'll make sure to find the culprit.

75
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:48.412
This isn't just about Jung Hee.

76
00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:50.421
It almost took away...

77
00:03:50.421 --> 00:03:52.921
the life of a young man.

78
00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:55.391
Right, I almost forgot.

79
00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:57.162
What happened to that boy?

80
00:03:57.391 --> 00:03:59.262
What a headache.

81
00:03:59.391 --> 00:04:01.391
Is he an orphan?

82
00:04:01.562 --> 00:04:03.331
Why is it that no one came for him?

83
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:05.861
Bong Soo says...

84
00:04:05.901 --> 00:04:09.572
that his parents are traveling abroad.

85
00:04:10.342 --> 00:04:12.072
- Abroad? - Yes.

86
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:16.582
They must be rich.

87
00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:18.311
He didn't want his parents to worry,

88
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.212
so he begged the nurse...

89
00:04:20.212 --> 00:04:22.381
not to contact his parents.

90
00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.022
- What a good son. - Yes.

91
00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:26.952
My goodness.

92
00:04:27.022 --> 00:04:28.952
Now that I look closely,

93
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:30.421
he looks pretty handsome.

94
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:33.131
He has thick eyebrows.

95
00:04:33.462 --> 00:04:35.691
- Look at that big nose. - Yes.

96
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:39.261
Those lips are like cherries.

97
00:04:39.602 --> 00:04:43.441
You said he's in Bong Soo's class, right?

98
00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:47.412
Yes. Apparently, he gets the highest marks.

99
00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.941
Really? What?

100
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:51.782
Is he smiling?

101
00:04:56.852 --> 00:04:57.952
I was happy.

102
00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:02.421
Jung Hee, you held me so tightly.

103
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:04.522
I was so happy.

104
00:05:04.962 --> 00:05:07.392
I couldn't ask for anything more.

105
00:05:07.732 --> 00:05:09.431
I'd be a happy man even if I died.

106
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:12.162
Dong Moon, can you hear me?

107
00:05:13.532 --> 00:05:14.671
I guess not.

108
00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:16.972
Could he have...

109
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:18.902
hurt his head?

110
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:20.241
No!

111
00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:22.412
What do we do?

112
00:05:23.212 --> 00:05:24.941
- Did he go crazy? - My goodness!

113
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:26.712
What do we do?

114
00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:35.852
Are you closed?

115
00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:37.792
Hello.

116
00:05:45.332 --> 00:05:47.602
How can I help you today?

117
00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:52.402
Is it a headache?

118
00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:53.941
A toothache?

119
00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:56.042
No?

120
00:05:57.082 --> 00:05:58.611
Then...

121
00:05:58.712 --> 00:06:00.452
I need digestive medicine.

122
00:06:00.782 --> 00:06:02.611
I have an upset stomach.

123
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.251
Sure.

124
00:06:07.792 --> 00:06:10.022
Digestive medicine...

125
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.871
Hae Joo. Can't you think it over?

126
00:06:27.811 --> 00:06:28.941
I want to go out with you.

127
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.042
Jin.

128
00:06:30.782 --> 00:06:32.852
Like I said before,

129
00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:34.511
I'd prefer it...

130
00:06:34.982 --> 00:06:37.652
if we could remain as friends.

131
00:06:39.022 --> 00:06:40.051
Hae Joo,

132
00:06:40.792 --> 00:06:41.821
don't be like this.

133
00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:43.022
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:44.361
Why are you...

135
00:06:53.972 --> 00:06:55.032
Hello.

136
00:06:55.032 --> 00:06:58.202
(Kim's Pharmacy)

137
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:07.452
I don't think you came to the broadcasting show.

138
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:09.722
I didn't see you there, mister.

139
00:07:10.022 --> 00:07:13.152
Do you think I have time on my hands?

140
00:07:26.102 --> 00:07:27.332
Also,

141
00:07:31.342 --> 00:07:32.972
I'm not that old.

142
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:43.921
Okay.

143
00:07:55.032 --> 00:07:57.532
Looking at the survey results,

144
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:58.832
our fellow students are surprisingly...

145
00:07:58.832 --> 00:08:02.301
more worried about love than their marks.

146
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:06.102
Have you ever worried about your love life?

147
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:07.671
I think you would have many men around you.

148
00:08:12.412 --> 00:08:13.511
I'm not sure.

149
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:15.611
You can be honest with us.

150
00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:17.921
What about you?

151
00:08:17.982 --> 00:08:19.321
Of course I have.

152
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:21.592
I see. Were there a lot?

153
00:08:21.592 --> 00:08:24.321
- Just once. - I think you're lying.

154
00:08:24.392 --> 00:08:25.522
No, I'm not.

155
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:42.472
Dad's home.

156
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:44.942
Dad, are you...

157
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:48.182
Do you have a guest?

158
00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:49.621
Pardon me.

159
00:09:00.161 --> 00:09:01.932
Hey, Hae Joo.

160
00:09:03.531 --> 00:09:05.661
Did you see anyone outside?

161
00:09:05.832 --> 00:09:06.932
Anyone suspicious?

162
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:11.202
- No. - Is that so?

163
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:14.942
Who is that man?

164
00:09:14.942 --> 00:09:17.381
He's a student of mine.

165
00:09:17.381 --> 00:09:21.052
Hae Joo, he's going to stay a few days with us.

166
00:09:21.052 --> 00:09:24.822
You can't tell anyone about it. Okay?

167
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:27.222
- Yes, Dad. - Good.

168
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:29.592
Get some rest.

169
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:42.572
(Yi Il Hospital)

170
00:09:55.982 --> 00:09:58.521
I'm late! Why didn't the alarm...

171
00:10:03.462 --> 00:10:04.462
Right.

172
00:10:07.491 --> 00:10:08.661
My head hurts.

173
00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:11.631
Where did everyone go?

174
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:13.371
Are they out to eat?

175
00:10:14.472 --> 00:10:16.541
(Lee Byung Sae, Bae Dong Moon)

176
00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:17.802
Bae Dong Moon.

177
00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:21.871
Did he get discharged already?

178
00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:27.411
Excuse me, did the guy here leave?

179
00:10:27.411 --> 00:10:29.052
I wish.

180
00:10:29.052 --> 00:10:30.651
His condition worsened overnight.

181
00:10:30.651 --> 00:10:32.151
We had to send him to a hospital in Seoul.

182
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:33.151
He's worse?

183
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:34.291
Yes.

184
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:40.261
Then Dong Moon...

185
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:42.361
Jung Hee, I'm so glad.

186
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:44.401
You're alive.

187
00:10:48.131 --> 00:10:49.332
No.

188
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:51.102
No, Dong Moon.

189
00:10:51.802 --> 00:10:53.312
It's my fault.

190
00:10:54.212 --> 00:10:56.241
It's all my fault.

191
00:10:58.182 --> 00:11:00.082
I'm sorry, Dong Moon.

192
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:05.452
Dong Moon.

193
00:11:06.692 --> 00:11:08.422
It's my fault.

194
00:11:09.422 --> 00:11:11.861
- I'm sorry, Dong Moon. - Hey.

195
00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:14.092
You don't have to be sorry.

196
00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:19.631
I thought you were sent to Seoul.

197
00:11:19.631 --> 00:11:20.631
What?

198
00:11:22.901 --> 00:11:24.271
My bed...

199
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:25.942
is over there.

200
00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:29.682
Then are you all right?

201
00:11:29.682 --> 00:11:30.682
Yes.

202
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:32.281
I'm completely fine.

203
00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:36.322
Do you know how much you startled me?

204
00:11:37.222 --> 00:11:38.222
Were you...

205
00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:41.192
worried about me?

206
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:45.922
Why did you surprise me like that?

207
00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:50.001
Jung Hee.

208
00:11:50.332 --> 00:11:51.962
Are you okay now?

209
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:54.401
I heard you came down with a terrible fever.

210
00:11:54.602 --> 00:11:57.241
Of course, you'd get a stomachache...

211
00:11:57.241 --> 00:11:58.641
from drinking so much water.

212
00:12:03.141 --> 00:12:04.212
Are you okay?

213
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:06.381
Well?

214
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.651
About that, I...

215
00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:13.991
Give it back! Give it back!

216
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:15.521
I want it back!

217
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:16.521
Hey.

218
00:12:16.822 --> 00:12:19.192
What? What do you want back?

219
00:12:23.732 --> 00:12:24.761
This?

220
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.631
- Whatever! - Oh, my.

221
00:12:28.702 --> 00:12:30.842
- I'm sorry. Are you okay? - Yes.

222
00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:33.011
Number three. What are you doing here?

223
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:35.672
Your mom said to bring you some porridge.

224
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.281
Seeing how strong you are, you must be all better.

225
00:12:40.182 --> 00:12:42.552
Jung Hee. You can be discharged now.

226
00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:48.192
Mom won't even come see me anymore?

227
00:12:48.222 --> 00:12:50.661
True. It's not like I'm Bong Soo.

228
00:12:50.761 --> 00:12:52.661
She doesn't care whether or not I die.

229
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:54.761
Don't even get me started.

230
00:12:54.891 --> 00:12:55.991
What?

231
00:13:02.001 --> 00:13:04.702
Are you saying Ae Sook pushed Jung Hee in?

232
00:13:04.972 --> 00:13:06.172
Okay.

233
00:13:06.472 --> 00:13:09.541
- I'll investigate... - Investigate?

234
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:10.881
I've already done that.

235
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.881
Forget it all. Get rid of her.

236
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:17.582
- Get rid of her? - Expel that brat,

237
00:13:17.582 --> 00:13:19.182
Shim Ae Sook.

238
00:13:20.991 --> 00:13:22.991
Well, but...

239
00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:24.861
You see, ma'am.

240
00:13:25.161 --> 00:13:27.531
Expelling a student...

241
00:13:27.531 --> 00:13:29.531
isn't all that simple.

242
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:30.661
Fine!

243
00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:33.202
If you refuse to expel her,

244
00:13:33.432 --> 00:13:36.501
I'll have no choice but to personally, myself,

245
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:39.712
send in a protest to the vice-commissioner...

246
00:13:39.712 --> 00:13:42.472
and the Minister of Education...

247
00:13:42.472 --> 00:13:45.141
and right this injustice. Is that okay?

248
00:13:45.511 --> 00:13:46.751
Protest?

249
00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:49.281
- Fine. Do as you wish. - Wait.

250
00:13:49.281 --> 00:13:52.452
I am just too angry right now...

251
00:13:52.452 --> 00:13:53.922
that I can't breathe.

252
00:13:54.322 --> 00:13:55.452
I'm sure.

253
00:13:55.452 --> 00:13:57.861
You have a child too, don't you?

254
00:14:06.771 --> 00:14:07.932
Something's strange.

255
00:14:08.232 --> 00:14:09.641
Are you...

256
00:14:10.501 --> 00:14:11.802
thinking about Jin again?

257
00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:15.641
Dong Moon.

258
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:18.541
I appreciate your saving me,

259
00:14:18.582 --> 00:14:21.781
but don't meddle with whom I think about.

260
00:14:22.212 --> 00:14:23.352
Got it?

261
00:14:29.121 --> 00:14:30.562
I like you.

262
00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:35.592
That's why I care.

263
00:14:39.062 --> 00:14:40.401
- What? - I know...

264
00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:45.702
that Jin is the only thing in your heart right now.

265
00:14:49.212 --> 00:14:50.442
As long as you know.

266
00:14:51.011 --> 00:14:52.982
I'll pretend I didn't hear what you just said.

267
00:14:52.982 --> 00:14:54.381
That's not right.

268
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:56.422
I like you.

269
00:14:56.582 --> 00:14:58.552
How could you pretend you didn't hear me?

270
00:14:58.552 --> 00:14:59.692
That's...

271
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:05.391
It's because I won't ever like you like that.

272
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:07.361
How do you know?

273
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:10.102
You don't know if it'll rain tomorrow...

274
00:15:10.102 --> 00:15:11.802
or if it'll be sunny. That's life.

275
00:15:11.802 --> 00:15:12.932
I do know.

276
00:15:12.932 --> 00:15:14.602
- You don't know. - I do too!

277
00:15:14.602 --> 00:15:15.631
You don't...

278
00:15:16.972 --> 00:15:18.072
know.

279
00:15:19.072 --> 00:15:20.271
I do too!

280
00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:24.141
That hurts. Let go. That hurts.

281
00:15:24.281 --> 00:15:26.651
You're really smooshy.

282
00:15:26.812 --> 00:15:28.111
You're like dough.

283
00:15:31.452 --> 00:15:32.582
What was that?

284
00:15:33.352 --> 00:15:35.052
Eat up, okay?

285
00:15:35.452 --> 00:15:36.722
Bye, Dough Boy.

286
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:45.962
Jung Hee.

287
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:56.281
Now that I told her,

288
00:15:56.712 --> 00:15:58.911
I feel like weight has been lifted.

289
00:16:01.582 --> 00:16:02.751
Actually, no.

290
00:16:06.592 --> 00:16:07.991
Why does it hurt so much?

291
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:09.791
It feels heavy.

292
00:16:21.802 --> 00:16:23.541
How could you?

293
00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:27.672
How is that? Do you admit it now?

294
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:29.271
I will not.

295
00:16:29.842 --> 00:16:32.342
She fell in. I didn't push her.

296
00:16:32.342 --> 00:16:33.651
No?

297
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:36.682
No? You brat.

298
00:16:40.052 --> 00:16:41.291
Get up.

299
00:16:41.891 --> 00:16:43.121
Get up!

300
00:16:48.432 --> 00:16:49.861
Then what?

301
00:16:50.102 --> 00:16:52.761
Are you saying you're fine being expelled?

302
00:16:53.371 --> 00:16:54.472
Do as you wish.

303
00:16:55.172 --> 00:16:57.442
I don't want to go to this stupid school.

304
00:16:57.672 --> 00:16:58.842
"Stupid school"?

305
00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:01.041
"Stupid school"?

306
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:04.511
Go to your class.

307
00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:06.781
Go to your class!

308
00:17:35.041 --> 00:17:36.182
Mr. Oh.

309
00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:40.182
- Yes? - I'd like to talk to you.

310
00:17:40.612 --> 00:17:41.612
Talk?

311
00:17:42.882 --> 00:17:44.122
Move!

312
00:17:44.622 --> 00:17:46.622
What the...

313
00:17:49.991 --> 00:17:51.261
Move!

314
00:17:58.402 --> 00:17:59.771
Is Jung Hee here yet?

315
00:18:00.071 --> 00:18:01.872
She's still in the hospital...

316
00:18:03.501 --> 00:18:04.601
because of you.

317
00:18:06.942 --> 00:18:08.311
Who reported me?

318
00:18:10.982 --> 00:18:12.112
It was you, right?

319
00:18:13.382 --> 00:18:16.882
Watch your back when you walk down the street.

320
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:21.521
If I see you...

321
00:18:22.722 --> 00:18:24.662
Like this...

322
00:18:26.192 --> 00:18:28.692
You may get a pretty scar on your face.

323
00:18:33.101 --> 00:18:34.202
Why are you laughing?

324
00:18:39.172 --> 00:18:40.271
Ae Sook.

325
00:18:44.741 --> 00:18:45.912
How can you do that?

326
00:18:45.982 --> 00:18:48.251
- What? - It isn't right...

327
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:51.122
to hit a friend's head like that.

328
00:18:52.152 --> 00:18:53.222
A friend?

329
00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:56.362
Why is she...

330
00:18:57.662 --> 00:18:58.692
my friend?

331
00:18:58.692 --> 00:19:01.991
We're in the same class. Aren't we all friends?

332
00:19:04.331 --> 00:19:06.031
Seriously.

333
00:19:06.872 --> 00:19:10.041
I wondered where I should let out my anger.

334
00:19:11.501 --> 00:19:14.071
So what? Who do you think you are?

335
00:19:15.942 --> 00:19:17.112
Who do you think you are?

336
00:19:17.382 --> 00:19:18.412
Why?

337
00:19:20.912 --> 00:19:22.081
Will you hit me too?

338
00:19:23.152 --> 00:19:24.251
Go ahead.

339
00:19:28.851 --> 00:19:30.791
You stupid pig.

340
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:34.132
You still haven't learned your lesson.

341
00:19:34.892 --> 00:19:38.162
How dare you start up with Hae Joo?

342
00:19:39.632 --> 00:19:42.071
Just because you're in the same class,

343
00:19:42.101 --> 00:19:43.702
do you think you're equal?

344
00:19:44.372 --> 00:19:46.001
You punk.

345
00:19:46.341 --> 00:19:48.071
Just wait two years.

346
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.081
Human trash like you...

347
00:19:50.581 --> 00:19:52.541
can't dare even look at a refined...

348
00:19:52.541 --> 00:19:54.712
- college girl like her. - Mr. Oh.

349
00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:56.722
- That's too... - You're right.

350
00:19:57.722 --> 00:19:58.952
I can't look at her.

351
00:20:00.091 --> 00:20:01.251
I know...

352
00:20:01.892 --> 00:20:05.222
that the trash that may be expelled at any point,

353
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:09.132
and the professor's precious daughter...

354
00:20:10.601 --> 00:20:12.031
don't even compare.

355
00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:13.801
You little...

356
00:20:15.472 --> 00:20:16.642
Ae Sook.

357
00:20:17.271 --> 00:20:19.172
Go kneel in the hall.

358
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:21.172
Now!

359
00:20:25.982 --> 00:20:27.011
Fine.

360
00:20:29.751 --> 00:20:31.281
Why that...

361
00:20:34.922 --> 00:20:36.162
Are you okay?

362
00:20:36.722 --> 00:20:38.061
You must've been startled.

363
00:20:39.561 --> 00:20:40.962
- Mr. Oh... - What are you doing?

364
00:20:41.192 --> 00:20:42.531
Sit in your seats.

365
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:51.972
There's Jung Hee.

366
00:20:51.972 --> 00:20:53.841
What? Jung Hee.

367
00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:55.571
Are you feeling better?

368
00:20:56.811 --> 00:20:59.482
Did you go to the market already?

369
00:20:59.482 --> 00:21:01.511
You're a real piece of work.

370
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.682
Look how skinny you look.

371
00:21:03.922 --> 00:21:04.922
Are you okay?

372
00:21:04.922 --> 00:21:07.222
I am not. What's your problem?

373
00:21:07.222 --> 00:21:09.251
You barely came to see me.

374
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:11.521
I was too busy playing to visit.

375
00:21:11.892 --> 00:21:14.831
I was too busy partying to visit.

376
00:21:14.962 --> 00:21:16.862
- Sorry. - I'll bring this in.

377
00:21:16.932 --> 00:21:18.702
Did they demand more money...

378
00:21:18.702 --> 00:21:20.972
because she left after lunch?

379
00:21:21.132 --> 00:21:22.972
- Of course not. - You and your money.

380
00:21:22.972 --> 00:21:25.172
You hate having to pay my hospital bill, right?

381
00:21:25.172 --> 00:21:27.972
Yes, I do. It makes me so angry, I almost died.

382
00:21:27.972 --> 00:21:29.412
You know me so well.

383
00:21:29.712 --> 00:21:32.011
Jung Hee. Your friend is here.

384
00:21:33.811 --> 00:21:34.882
Jung Hee.

385
00:21:36.751 --> 00:21:38.081
Hello.

386
00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:39.791
Weren't you at the hospital yesterday?

387
00:21:39.952 --> 00:21:41.821
Those flowers are so pretty.

388
00:22:05.041 --> 00:22:06.112
Jung Hee.

389
00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:08.781
Here.

390
00:22:09.922 --> 00:22:11.622
Why did you bring me flowers?

391
00:22:16.791 --> 00:22:18.422
What did the doctors say?

392
00:22:19.392 --> 00:22:20.862
Are you better now?

393
00:22:22.831 --> 00:22:23.831
Hae Joo.

394
00:22:24.732 --> 00:22:26.501
Will you tell me the truth?

395
00:22:29.402 --> 00:22:32.172
What's going on between you and Jin?

396
00:22:32.372 --> 00:22:33.642
Are you two dating?

397
00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:35.341
Or...

398
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:37.982
was Jin...

399
00:22:38.982 --> 00:22:40.281
hitting on you?

400
00:22:40.581 --> 00:22:43.482
Jun Hee was looking so forward to the show.

401
00:22:43.482 --> 00:22:44.581
She was.

402
00:22:44.581 --> 00:22:47.821
She was so happy that she could announce...

403
00:22:47.821 --> 00:22:50.722
to all of Daegu that she's Son Jin's girl.

404
00:22:52.291 --> 00:22:53.692
Tell me the truth.

405
00:22:54.291 --> 00:22:55.831
There's nothing going on between us.

406
00:23:01.232 --> 00:23:02.232
You mean it?

407
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:06.741
If you're trying to comfort me,

408
00:23:08.212 --> 00:23:09.942
I don't want it.

409
00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:12.882
That isn't comforting me,

410
00:23:13.112 --> 00:23:15.212
but making me a total loser and a fool.

411
00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:16.622
Jung Hee.

412
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:21.652
I don't have any feelings for Jin.

413
00:23:22.222 --> 00:23:25.622
I hope we don't grow apart because of him.

414
00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:28.732
I mean it.

415
00:23:38.541 --> 00:23:40.511
What are they saying?

416
00:23:43.712 --> 00:23:44.712
Scram.

417
00:23:48.281 --> 00:23:50.051
Excuse me.

418
00:24:03.001 --> 00:24:04.261
Hello.

419
00:24:04.462 --> 00:24:07.301
Why are you making your guest stand?

420
00:24:07.301 --> 00:24:09.331
Sit down. You don't need to hold the roof up.

421
00:24:12.541 --> 00:24:15.372
Goodness. You look like such a good girl.

422
00:24:15.372 --> 00:24:17.712
You transferred from Seoul?

423
00:24:17.712 --> 00:24:18.712
Yes.

424
00:24:19.442 --> 00:24:21.452
- What does your dad do? - Mom.

425
00:24:21.452 --> 00:24:24.581
Hae Joo's father...

426
00:24:24.722 --> 00:24:28.551
is a professor at Seoul University, correct?

427
00:24:30.462 --> 00:24:32.662
Why is he talking like that?

428
00:24:33.892 --> 00:24:36.561
Your dad is a professor at Seoul University?

429
00:24:37.531 --> 00:24:39.501
Come over often.

430
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:42.031
Come, and help Jung Hee with her studies.

431
00:24:42.702 --> 00:24:44.442
I'm terrible in school too.

432
00:24:44.442 --> 00:24:45.501
Good for you.

433
00:24:46.001 --> 00:24:47.771
Eat. Come on.

434
00:24:49.412 --> 00:24:51.142
Here. You. Get out.

435
00:24:51.942 --> 00:24:54.081
My leg is cramping.

436
00:24:56.452 --> 00:24:59.622
Hae Joo, thanks for coming over.

437
00:24:59.622 --> 00:25:01.251
Come over often.

438
00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:03.261
- I will. - Good, good.

439
00:25:04.591 --> 00:25:06.122
- Have a nice day. - Okay.

440
00:25:07.462 --> 00:25:08.591
Bong Soo.

441
00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:11.031
Are you going somewhere? Why are you dressed up?

442
00:25:11.862 --> 00:25:13.732
Hae Joo, let's go.

443
00:25:13.732 --> 00:25:15.031
I'll walk you home.

444
00:25:15.031 --> 00:25:16.902
It's okay. My house is close by.

445
00:25:16.902 --> 00:25:19.811
No, no. I'll escort you.

446
00:25:19.811 --> 00:25:21.811
There are so many thugs in the area.

447
00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:24.712
He's right. You don't want to run into Young Choon.

448
00:25:24.712 --> 00:25:26.581
- Walk her. - Right?

449
00:25:27.412 --> 00:25:28.811
Let's go, Hae Joo.

450
00:25:29.311 --> 00:25:30.551
Have a nice day.

451
00:25:31.482 --> 00:25:33.091
Go on. Bye.

452
00:25:35.622 --> 00:25:38.192
Bong Soo is grinning ear to ear.

453
00:25:38.192 --> 00:25:40.831
He kept going on and on about Olivia Cosmos.

454
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:42.591
Cosmos? What's that?

455
00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:45.001
Is she Olivia Cosmos?

456
00:25:45.001 --> 00:25:46.132
Yes.

457
00:25:46.132 --> 00:25:49.432
So many guys are lovesick because of that girl.

458
00:25:49.432 --> 00:25:50.672
Olivia?

459
00:25:55.696 --> 00:25:58.928

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

460
00:26:03.452 --> 00:26:04.452
Jung Hee.

461
00:26:04.652 --> 00:26:07.452
I don't have any feelings for Jin.

462
00:26:07.652 --> 00:26:10.991
I hope we don't grow apart because of him.

463
00:26:13.031 --> 00:26:14.132
I mean it.

464
00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:19.001
Jung Hee.

465
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:22.531
I forgot to bring this in.

466
00:26:27.741 --> 00:26:28.942
Did Hae Joo leave?

467
00:26:30.482 --> 00:26:31.482
Why?

468
00:26:31.811 --> 00:26:33.682
You feel bad for not walking her out, right?

469
00:26:34.182 --> 00:26:35.412
I do not.

470
00:26:38.922 --> 00:26:39.922
Auntie.

471
00:26:41.021 --> 00:26:42.692
Hae Joo is prettier than I am, right?

472
00:26:42.692 --> 00:26:43.862
In what way?

473
00:26:44.362 --> 00:26:45.821
Bong Soo...

474
00:26:46.091 --> 00:26:49.091
kept calling her "Olivia Cosmos",

475
00:26:49.232 --> 00:26:52.301
so I thought she was prettier than an actress,

476
00:26:52.402 --> 00:26:53.531
but she wasn't.

477
00:26:53.732 --> 00:26:56.472
I think you are much prettier.

478
00:26:58.071 --> 00:27:00.142
- Do you mean it? - I mean it.

479
00:27:06.652 --> 00:27:08.251
(Jung Hee.)

480
00:27:08.952 --> 00:27:09.982
It's from Dong Moon.

481
00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:11.321
What?

482
00:27:14.452 --> 00:27:15.452
What?

483
00:27:15.652 --> 00:27:16.722
Jung Hee.

484
00:27:17.591 --> 00:27:19.462
You were so sound asleep,

485
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:21.331
so I couldn't say bye.

486
00:27:25.662 --> 00:27:26.672
Know something?

487
00:27:27.872 --> 00:27:28.972
You...

488
00:27:34.642 --> 00:27:37.041
look pretty even when you sleep.

489
00:27:46.051 --> 00:27:48.791
See? Dong Moon also says you're pretty.

490
00:27:51.192 --> 00:27:52.462
What?

491
00:27:54.491 --> 00:27:55.632
Also,

492
00:27:56.162 --> 00:27:57.331
this is a gift.

493
00:27:57.662 --> 00:27:58.831
Get well soon.

494
00:27:59.531 --> 00:28:03.472
Dong Moon is a terrible artist. Right?

495
00:28:05.801 --> 00:28:08.011
Time for dinner.

496
00:28:08.011 --> 00:28:09.011
Okay.

497
00:28:10.741 --> 00:28:13.251
Goodness. Let's eat.

498
00:28:18.021 --> 00:28:19.021
What's this?

499
00:28:19.692 --> 00:28:21.091
It's ox knee soup.

500
00:28:21.091 --> 00:28:24.091
Mom got it for Jung Hee to get better soon.

501
00:28:25.122 --> 00:28:26.531
Were you sick?

502
00:28:26.991 --> 00:28:28.232
Father.

503
00:28:29.232 --> 00:28:31.202
Of course, she was.

504
00:28:31.202 --> 00:28:34.172
She fell into the water two days ago.

505
00:28:34.172 --> 00:28:35.672
The girl was a moron.

506
00:28:35.672 --> 00:28:37.942
Why are you making her ox knee soup?

507
00:28:38.372 --> 00:28:39.672
Do you have money to burn?

508
00:28:40.912 --> 00:28:42.841
I didn't use your money.

509
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:44.341
I used my secret stash.

510
00:28:45.081 --> 00:28:46.652
Your secret stash isn't my money?

511
00:28:46.912 --> 00:28:49.682
What you wear, what you stuff into your mouth,

512
00:28:49.952 --> 00:28:52.081
that was all bought with my money.

513
00:28:52.722 --> 00:28:54.051
You little...

514
00:28:54.692 --> 00:28:57.491
It's not like that brat gave birth or anything.

515
00:28:57.722 --> 00:29:00.232
If you spend money on nothing like that,

516
00:29:00.232 --> 00:29:01.692
when will we pay off our debt?

517
00:29:02.902 --> 00:29:05.132
Money spent on the factory last year...

518
00:29:05.132 --> 00:29:06.432
and the new machines,

519
00:29:06.432 --> 00:29:08.632
we're buried in debt. Did you forget?

520
00:29:09.031 --> 00:29:11.041
Seriously. Let's eat.

521
00:29:11.341 --> 00:29:13.712
You are so mean.

522
00:29:13.841 --> 00:29:14.841
What?

523
00:29:15.372 --> 00:29:16.482
How am I mean?

524
00:29:16.882 --> 00:29:18.041
How dare you talk back to me?

525
00:29:18.642 --> 00:29:21.051
You don't care if your daughter drowns,

526
00:29:21.081 --> 00:29:23.581
or dies in the hospital.

527
00:29:23.882 --> 00:29:25.982
You didn't come see me once.

528
00:29:25.982 --> 00:29:28.291
But you're throwing a fit because of some soup?

529
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:29.962
Have you lost your mind?

530
00:29:31.761 --> 00:29:32.831
What did you say?

531
00:29:35.962 --> 00:29:36.962
"Throwing a fit"?

532
00:29:42.001 --> 00:29:43.071
What are you doing?

533
00:29:43.071 --> 00:29:45.672
"Throwing a fit"? Is that what you said?

534
00:29:45.672 --> 00:29:48.041
You wouldn't have done that if it were Bong Soo!

535
00:29:48.271 --> 00:29:50.811
Yes, your dad is an immature brat.

536
00:29:50.811 --> 00:29:52.241
Please stop.

537
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:54.152
And what? Did you die?

538
00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:56.011
Are you in a coma?

539
00:29:56.422 --> 00:29:58.551
You're alive and well.

540
00:29:58.682 --> 00:30:02.091
I'm working like crazy to support my family.

541
00:30:02.091 --> 00:30:05.061
How dare you raise your voice at me?

542
00:30:05.061 --> 00:30:07.291
If it were Bong Soo, you would've called...

543
00:30:07.291 --> 00:30:09.091
an ambulance and brought him to Seoul!

544
00:30:09.091 --> 00:30:11.202
You brat! That's enough!

545
00:30:11.202 --> 00:30:12.632
That's only natural.

546
00:30:12.632 --> 00:30:14.632
I told you over and over.

547
00:30:14.632 --> 00:30:16.642
You, who will end up joining another family,

548
00:30:17.001 --> 00:30:19.642
don't compare to Bong Soo, our precious only son.

549
00:30:20.511 --> 00:30:21.571
I...

550
00:30:21.811 --> 00:30:24.412
will not prepare someone else's memorial!

551
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:27.452
- What? - I...

552
00:30:27.882 --> 00:30:30.122
won't live like Mom.

553
00:30:30.682 --> 00:30:33.051
I'm going to become a crazy successful woman.

554
00:30:33.622 --> 00:30:36.291
My husband will prepare our family's memorials.

555
00:30:36.291 --> 00:30:37.392
You brat.

556
00:30:38.122 --> 00:30:40.462
After all we did to raise you...

557
00:30:40.591 --> 00:30:42.132
What did you...

558
00:30:42.362 --> 00:30:44.732
- You should just die. - Father.

559
00:30:44.732 --> 00:30:47.972
She fell in the river and almost died!

560
00:30:47.972 --> 00:30:49.801
How could you say you'll kill her?

561
00:30:49.902 --> 00:30:52.071
- Fine! Kill her! - Why you...

562
00:30:52.071 --> 00:30:53.771
- Get over here! - Stop it!

563
00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:56.341
- Move. - Stop it.

564
00:30:56.341 --> 00:30:59.182
- Move! - Please stop, sir.

565
00:30:59.751 --> 00:31:01.551
Don't hit Jung Hee!

566
00:31:05.422 --> 00:31:06.722
Move.

567
00:31:06.991 --> 00:31:08.222
Hello?

568
00:31:09.122 --> 00:31:11.122
Is anyone in?

569
00:31:11.761 --> 00:31:12.831
Someone's here.

570
00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:17.402
Someone's here?

571
00:31:18.061 --> 00:31:19.162
Someone's here.

572
00:31:23.001 --> 00:31:24.872
Someone's here. Clean up.

573
00:31:25.771 --> 00:31:26.771
Who is it?

574
00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:35.311
Ma'am.

575
00:31:35.581 --> 00:31:38.152
I agree with everything you said...

576
00:31:38.152 --> 00:31:40.192
at the school today.

577
00:31:40.192 --> 00:31:43.491
If I could have my way, I'd like to kick out...

578
00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:45.692
this wretched wench.

579
00:31:45.692 --> 00:31:47.091
Ma'am.

580
00:31:48.061 --> 00:31:50.432
Can't you forgive her just this once?

581
00:31:50.862 --> 00:31:52.831
Ae Sook should be punished...

582
00:31:52.831 --> 00:31:54.771
for what she did.

583
00:31:55.132 --> 00:31:57.172
But she's still a child.

584
00:31:57.172 --> 00:31:58.942
As a fellow mother...

585
00:31:58.942 --> 00:32:00.912
We understand what you mean.

586
00:32:03.142 --> 00:32:06.652
I knew it. Mr. Lee is a businessman,

587
00:32:06.652 --> 00:32:08.952
so he's generous like no other.

588
00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:10.321
In exchange,

589
00:32:10.851 --> 00:32:12.081
I have a condition.

590
00:32:12.351 --> 00:32:13.351
Sure.

591
00:32:14.251 --> 00:32:15.291
You.

592
00:32:17.321 --> 00:32:18.722
Apologize to Jung Hee.

593
00:32:19.321 --> 00:32:21.692
Yes. We brought her here...

594
00:32:21.962 --> 00:32:25.001
to apologize and make up.

595
00:32:25.001 --> 00:32:28.301
You. Get on your knees, and beg for forgiveness.

596
00:32:33.612 --> 00:32:34.642
- What? - What?

597
00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:36.311
What did he say?

598
00:32:36.942 --> 00:32:39.851
She was wrong, so she should beg.

599
00:32:40.452 --> 00:32:41.511
Are you insane?

600
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.122
Watch your mouth.

601
00:32:43.652 --> 00:32:45.882
She almost drowned my precious daughter.

602
00:32:45.882 --> 00:32:49.351
I should send her to jail for the rest of her life.

603
00:32:50.392 --> 00:32:52.892
So... You.

604
00:32:53.791 --> 00:32:55.591
Get on your knees, and beg Jung Hee for forgiveness.

605
00:32:58.932 --> 00:33:00.632
Do as he says.

606
00:33:01.902 --> 00:33:03.472
I can't do that.

607
00:33:05.601 --> 00:33:07.112
Jung Hee, come out.

608
00:33:07.372 --> 00:33:08.442
Jung Hee.

609
00:33:09.372 --> 00:33:11.511
Just expel me.

610
00:33:14.081 --> 00:33:16.222
The store your mom runs...

611
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:20.991
My close friend owns the building.

612
00:33:21.551 --> 00:33:23.821
I can have him evict her, right?

613
00:33:24.922 --> 00:33:26.122
Tomorrow.

614
00:33:26.791 --> 00:33:29.462
Father! That's not right.

615
00:33:31.162 --> 00:33:32.261
Is that okay?

616
00:33:33.571 --> 00:33:35.501
Please stop.

617
00:33:35.501 --> 00:33:37.942
I heard she's behind on rent anyway.

618
00:33:38.702 --> 00:33:40.841
She took out her deposit long ago.

619
00:33:41.642 --> 00:33:44.412
You know your mom has a bad rep, right?

620
00:33:45.942 --> 00:33:48.011
I wonder if he has a new tenant yet.

621
00:33:49.051 --> 00:33:50.821
Don't say that in front of a child.

622
00:33:50.952 --> 00:33:52.751
Ae Sook. What are you doing?

623
00:33:53.722 --> 00:33:54.821
Sir.

624
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:57.622
You can't do that to a child.

625
00:33:58.222 --> 00:34:00.261
The children were fighting...

626
00:34:04.261 --> 00:34:06.432
- I apologize. - Hey, Ae Sook!

627
00:34:08.172 --> 00:34:09.942
Sorry, Jung Hee.

628
00:34:10.942 --> 00:34:13.811
I was wrong.

629
00:34:14.512 --> 00:34:17.112
Get up! Don't get on your knees.

630
00:34:17.342 --> 00:34:18.581
Get up!

631
00:34:19.951 --> 00:34:21.512
Father, how could you do this?

632
00:34:22.112 --> 00:34:24.181
You can't relieve your guilt toward me like this.

633
00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:27.922
Get up! I said to get up! Get up!

634
00:34:39.161 --> 00:34:40.271
Jung Hee.

635
00:34:41.672 --> 00:34:43.742
Jung Hee.

636
00:34:44.101 --> 00:34:46.172
Don't be like that. Restrain yourself.

637
00:34:46.442 --> 00:34:48.672
Jung... Jung Hee.

638
00:34:50.712 --> 00:34:52.411
Jung Hee.

639
00:35:27.681 --> 00:35:29.311
I hated Ae Sook,

640
00:35:29.311 --> 00:35:30.951
who pushed me into the water,

641
00:35:31.782 --> 00:35:34.621
and I hated Hae Joo, who I felt...

642
00:35:34.891 --> 00:35:36.391
had won over Jin's heart,

643
00:35:37.462 --> 00:35:41.092
but the person I hated the most was my father.

644
00:35:41.192 --> 00:35:43.001
- If you spend money... - All he does...

645
00:35:43.001 --> 00:35:45.132
is raise his voice.

646
00:35:45.532 --> 00:35:47.431
What are you doing?

647
00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:50.641
He thinks the world revolves around him.

648
00:35:50.942 --> 00:35:52.871
- You should just die. - Father.

649
00:35:52.871 --> 00:35:54.911
- Stop it! - He never...

650
00:35:55.072 --> 00:35:56.882
admits his wrong.

651
00:35:57.581 --> 00:35:59.882
- He oppresses the weak... - Get on your knees.

652
00:36:00.311 --> 00:36:03.282
In order to hide his embarrassing flaws.

653
00:36:06.422 --> 00:36:07.621
I...

654
00:36:08.492 --> 00:36:09.822
really hate...

655
00:36:10.692 --> 00:36:12.161
my father.

656
00:36:14.032 --> 00:36:16.161
- Hey. - Hello, Mr. Lee.

657
00:36:16.862 --> 00:36:19.831
Did you come yourself to get cold medicine?

658
00:36:22.771 --> 00:36:23.802
Get to work.

659
00:36:25.471 --> 00:36:28.242
Hey. What do you need to put...

660
00:36:28.672 --> 00:36:29.842
on a burn?

661
00:36:30.342 --> 00:36:32.482
Did someone get burned? Who?

662
00:36:36.882 --> 00:36:38.951
- Give it to me. - Yes, sir.

663
00:36:43.192 --> 00:36:44.221
Gosh.

664
00:37:39.681 --> 00:37:40.982
You scared me.

665
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:42.922
What are you doing?

666
00:37:45.621 --> 00:37:46.721
Young Choon.

667
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:50.661
Can you buy me some alcohol?

668
00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:53.331
You're too young to drink. It's late.

669
00:37:54.092 --> 00:37:56.632
Go home, and go to bed.

670
00:37:57.962 --> 00:38:00.302
Then I won't drink.

671
00:38:00.371 --> 00:38:03.342
Can't you just stay with me?

672
00:38:05.141 --> 00:38:06.512
Eng Cho is waiting.

673
00:38:12.681 --> 00:38:14.152
This is where you were.

674
00:38:15.782 --> 00:38:17.052
Want a drink?

675
00:38:21.891 --> 00:38:22.891
Ae Sook.

676
00:38:25.061 --> 00:38:26.391
Go home. Now.

677
00:38:29.232 --> 00:38:30.431
Fine, let's drink.

678
00:38:33.371 --> 00:38:35.101
Let's drink until we die.

679
00:38:36.201 --> 00:38:37.302
Hey, Peanut.

680
00:38:38.101 --> 00:38:39.541
I said to go home.

681
00:38:41.271 --> 00:38:43.411
Thanks, Young Choon,

682
00:38:44.012 --> 00:38:45.242
for lending me your girlfriend.

683
00:38:55.322 --> 00:38:56.462
Let's go.

684
00:39:01.692 --> 00:39:03.561
It was about 1:20am.

685
00:39:04.032 --> 00:39:06.802
I went out to go to the bathroom,

686
00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:08.701
- and... - Bam!

687
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:12.371
The tenant girl brought her boyfriend again?

688
00:39:13.911 --> 00:39:15.442
What were they doing?

689
00:39:15.612 --> 00:39:18.411
They were shuffling around for a while, and then...

690
00:39:18.742 --> 00:39:20.911
I heard some strange ripping sound.

691
00:39:21.251 --> 00:39:22.382
Ripping sound?

692
00:39:22.482 --> 00:39:24.052
Did they break something?

693
00:39:24.181 --> 00:39:25.782
No.

694
00:39:26.791 --> 00:39:29.492
It was the sound of her blouse ripping.

695
00:39:29.661 --> 00:39:31.962
Her blouse ripped.

696
00:39:32.521 --> 00:39:33.561
Then...

697
00:39:33.862 --> 00:39:35.931
Hae Joo came to me,

698
00:39:36.561 --> 00:39:40.101
but I couldn't get myself to go to her.

699
00:39:40.101 --> 00:39:42.132
"Look." That's what he said.

700
00:39:42.331 --> 00:39:44.541
I wanted to believe her,

701
00:39:45.302 --> 00:39:48.641
but I couldn't stop thinking that there was...

702
00:39:48.811 --> 00:39:50.342
something going on with her and Jin.

703
00:39:51.411 --> 00:39:52.442
Why is that?

704
00:39:53.581 --> 00:39:56.112
What is it? I didn't hear the bell.

705
00:39:56.681 --> 00:39:59.521
We don't have math this period.

706
00:39:59.521 --> 00:40:00.851
Okay, okay. Quiet.

707
00:40:01.152 --> 00:40:03.822
I rushed over...

708
00:40:04.322 --> 00:40:06.492
to share the news...

709
00:40:06.632 --> 00:40:08.962
of a very happy event in our class...

710
00:40:08.962 --> 00:40:11.501
as soon as possible.

711
00:40:12.101 --> 00:40:14.632
Park Hae Joo of our class...

712
00:40:15.271 --> 00:40:18.902
scored the highest in the nation...

713
00:40:19.371 --> 00:40:22.112
on the national mock exam this semester.

714
00:40:22.311 --> 00:40:23.641
Amazing.

715
00:40:25.942 --> 00:40:27.052
Mr. Oh!

716
00:40:28.782 --> 00:40:31.922
We took that mock exam...

717
00:40:33.192 --> 00:40:35.152
- before she came. - What?

718
00:40:35.152 --> 00:40:37.121
What are you talking about?

719
00:40:37.962 --> 00:40:39.962
She scored the highest in the nation.

720
00:40:40.161 --> 00:40:43.262
It doesn't matter where she took the exam.

721
00:40:43.262 --> 00:40:45.701
It's all the same, idiot.

722
00:40:45.831 --> 00:40:47.732
Also, I just heard...

723
00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:51.242
that Hae Joo came in first in the National...

724
00:40:52.371 --> 00:40:55.612
Presidential Essay Competition,

725
00:40:55.612 --> 00:40:57.212
Poetry Component.

726
00:40:59.612 --> 00:41:02.782
Okay. Hae Joo. Please stand up.

727
00:41:03.822 --> 00:41:05.351
Go on.

728
00:41:09.121 --> 00:41:11.462
Our class' treasure. Our diamond.

729
00:41:11.721 --> 00:41:13.431
Let's give Hae Joo...

730
00:41:13.692 --> 00:41:15.962
a warm round of applause!

731
00:41:25.742 --> 00:41:26.911
That's right.

732
00:41:27.771 --> 00:41:30.181
I don't compare to Hae Joo.

733
00:41:30.512 --> 00:41:32.742
We will now begin the afternoon broadcast...

734
00:41:32.951 --> 00:41:34.851
by Jeonghyeon's broadcasting club.

735
00:41:41.422 --> 00:41:42.992
In every aspect.

736
00:41:44.561 --> 00:41:46.492
Hae Joo!

737
00:41:47.192 --> 00:41:49.931
Where are you? Hae Joo!

738
00:41:49.962 --> 00:41:51.701
- Hae Joo! - She's coming.

739
00:41:51.701 --> 00:41:54.402
- She's so pretty. - Quiet.

740
00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:56.001
Have you eaten?

741
00:41:56.402 --> 00:41:57.871
The thought...

742
00:41:58.541 --> 00:42:01.871
that I don't come close to Hae Joo...

743
00:42:01.971 --> 00:42:05.141
as being Jin's girlfriend won't stop...

744
00:42:06.181 --> 00:42:08.012
tormenting me.

745
00:42:08.112 --> 00:42:10.251
Those guys are so pathetic.

746
00:42:11.322 --> 00:42:13.422
Jung Hee. Your brother is the worst...

747
00:42:13.422 --> 00:42:15.021
among them.

748
00:42:15.221 --> 00:42:16.791
Then what am I...

749
00:42:17.592 --> 00:42:18.891
supposed to do?

750
00:42:18.962 --> 00:42:20.962
Get lost! Scram!

751
00:42:20.962 --> 00:42:22.262
What do you mean?

752
00:42:22.431 --> 00:42:24.262
Tell your brother...

753
00:42:24.532 --> 00:42:26.061
to get it together.

754
00:42:26.061 --> 00:42:27.771
What else can I do?

755
00:42:27.931 --> 00:42:30.101
I'll have to expose the truth.

756
00:42:30.101 --> 00:42:31.971
What? Expose what?

757
00:42:32.342 --> 00:42:33.541
You guys go ahead.

758
00:42:33.612 --> 00:42:34.672
Jung Hee!

759
00:42:34.672 --> 00:42:36.882
Look. It's Jin.

760
00:42:36.882 --> 00:42:43.052
(Gyeryoon High School)

761
00:42:43.052 --> 00:42:45.052
- Jin. - Jin.

762
00:42:52.931 --> 00:42:54.161
Who's she?

763
00:42:54.262 --> 00:42:55.331
Jung Hee.

764
00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:57.462
Are you okay now?

765
00:43:09.012 --> 00:43:10.081
What is it?

766
00:43:10.411 --> 00:43:11.581
Jin.

767
00:43:12.641 --> 00:43:15.681
What's going on with you and Hae Joo?

768
00:43:17.081 --> 00:43:18.221
Hae Joo says...

769
00:43:18.482 --> 00:43:20.851
there's nothing between you, but...

770
00:43:24.791 --> 00:43:27.992
But I wanted to confirm with you.

771
00:43:28.462 --> 00:43:31.661
Do you like Hae Joo?

772
00:43:32.762 --> 00:43:34.732
Please tell me the truth.

773
00:43:36.471 --> 00:43:39.001
If you do,

774
00:43:40.842 --> 00:43:43.141
I'm going to stop...

775
00:43:46.512 --> 00:43:47.951
liking you.

776
00:43:52.052 --> 00:43:53.052
Jung Hee.

777
00:43:54.152 --> 00:43:56.462
You're spunkier than I thought.

778
00:43:57.422 --> 00:43:59.931
Please tell me.

779
00:44:02.061 --> 00:44:03.101
Hae Joo...

780
00:44:05.701 --> 00:44:06.732
Hae Joo...

781
00:44:10.342 --> 00:44:12.402
She's just a good friend.

782
00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:18.911
Is that true?

783
00:44:21.012 --> 00:44:22.181
Dong Moon.

784
00:44:25.681 --> 00:44:26.851
Hello.

785
00:44:27.192 --> 00:44:28.492
I'm sorry for interrupting.

786
00:44:28.592 --> 00:44:31.891
I'm Baek Dong Moon. I'm a junior.

787
00:44:31.962 --> 00:44:34.762
We met at the meeting of representatives.

788
00:44:35.291 --> 00:44:36.302
Really?

789
00:44:36.302 --> 00:44:38.661
What are you doing? Leave.

790
00:44:40.072 --> 00:44:41.132
Jung Hee...

791
00:44:42.971 --> 00:44:45.771
was in a lot of pain because of you.

792
00:44:46.942 --> 00:44:48.541
That's why I'm being rude...

793
00:44:48.842 --> 00:44:50.982
and asking you again to be sure.

794
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:54.581
Do you...

795
00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:56.681
like Jung Hee?

796
00:44:56.681 --> 00:44:59.322
- No. - Yes, I like her.

797
00:44:59.382 --> 00:45:00.391
Hey!

798
00:45:02.351 --> 00:45:05.462
You're in the heart of the girl I like,

799
00:45:06.192 --> 00:45:08.132
so I'm not all that happy.

800
00:45:08.492 --> 00:45:09.501
However,

801
00:45:10.962 --> 00:45:12.601
I'm afraid she'll get hurt...

802
00:45:12.601 --> 00:45:13.701
Dong Moon.

803
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:16.172
Stop it.

804
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:17.771
Dong Moon.

805
00:45:18.641 --> 00:45:19.641
You're cute.

806
00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:22.311
But you know your doing this...

807
00:45:23.012 --> 00:45:25.212
to a senior is very out of line,

808
00:45:26.811 --> 00:45:27.882
don't you?

809
00:45:28.581 --> 00:45:30.782
Yes, I do know.

810
00:45:31.822 --> 00:45:32.922
I'm sorry.

811
00:45:36.221 --> 00:45:38.021
Fine. As long as you know.

812
00:45:39.831 --> 00:45:40.831
Jung Hee.

813
00:45:41.592 --> 00:45:42.632
Goodbye.

814
00:45:47.572 --> 00:45:48.732
Wait!

815
00:45:57.041 --> 00:45:59.581
Young Choon. I'm here to pick up my medicine.

816
00:45:59.581 --> 00:46:00.951
Just a minute.

817
00:46:01.581 --> 00:46:03.121
First in the nation?

818
00:46:03.552 --> 00:46:05.322
Not first in Daegu?

819
00:46:05.322 --> 00:46:07.322
No. First in the nation.

820
00:46:07.322 --> 00:46:10.521
My gosh. Someone like that moved into our town?

821
00:46:10.521 --> 00:46:12.891
Yes. Hae Joo's father...

822
00:46:12.891 --> 00:46:15.061
is a professor at Seoul University.

823
00:46:15.061 --> 00:46:17.462
Oh my gosh. Why did someone like that...

824
00:46:17.462 --> 00:46:19.201
move down here?

825
00:46:19.632 --> 00:46:20.771
I don't know.

826
00:46:24.072 --> 00:46:25.541
- Here you go. - How much is it?

827
00:46:25.902 --> 00:46:26.942
That will be 50 cents.

828
00:46:28.041 --> 00:46:29.041
Here.

829
00:46:30.581 --> 00:46:31.842
Have a nice day.

830
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:33.052
You too.

831
00:46:58.971 --> 00:47:00.311
Who do you think you are?

832
00:47:00.641 --> 00:47:02.541
How could you follow me there?

833
00:47:02.641 --> 00:47:03.641
Me?

834
00:47:06.911 --> 00:47:08.552
The man who likes Jung Hee.

835
00:47:09.652 --> 00:47:11.822
- I told you. - Dong Moon.

836
00:47:12.282 --> 00:47:13.891
I'm warning you.

837
00:47:13.891 --> 00:47:15.192
Don't do that again.

838
00:47:15.192 --> 00:47:17.121
You're free to like me,

839
00:47:17.121 --> 00:47:18.322
but I won't condone...

840
00:47:18.322 --> 00:47:20.092
your meddling like this, got it?

841
00:47:21.732 --> 00:47:23.101
Don't you do this either.

842
00:47:24.032 --> 00:47:25.701
Even if you like Jin,

843
00:47:25.701 --> 00:47:27.532
you shouldn't show up at the school.

844
00:47:31.672 --> 00:47:32.771
That's up to me.

845
00:47:34.612 --> 00:47:35.842
It's up to me too.

846
00:47:42.411 --> 00:47:43.422
Are you hungry?

847
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:47.492
- Want some pastries? - Eat by yourself!

848
00:47:47.652 --> 00:47:49.092
You always want to eat pastries.

849
00:48:05.902 --> 00:48:07.041
Hello.

850
00:48:09.982 --> 00:48:11.141
Wait a few minutes.

851
00:48:11.311 --> 00:48:12.851
The pharmacist will be back soon.

852
00:48:13.282 --> 00:48:14.351
Well...

853
00:48:15.411 --> 00:48:17.882
I need a bandage...

854
00:48:18.181 --> 00:48:20.851
for a cut on the hand...

855
00:48:21.391 --> 00:48:22.592
How?

856
00:48:33.331 --> 00:48:34.771
Not me.

857
00:48:41.172 --> 00:48:42.882
A guest...

858
00:48:43.081 --> 00:48:45.382
cut his hand and I think...

859
00:48:46.751 --> 00:48:48.652
it got infected.

860
00:48:50.052 --> 00:48:52.221
Well, if that's the case,

861
00:48:52.891 --> 00:48:54.291
he should go to the hospital.

862
00:48:57.621 --> 00:49:00.462
He can't go to the hospital.

863
00:49:11.371 --> 00:49:13.811
I said to stop following me.

864
00:49:15.612 --> 00:49:17.242
I wasn't following you.

865
00:49:18.081 --> 00:49:20.612
I'm going to visit my friend,

866
00:49:21.282 --> 00:49:22.581
Bong Soo.

867
00:49:26.422 --> 00:49:27.422
Okay then.

868
00:49:29.791 --> 00:49:31.561
Come home safely.

869
00:49:44.072 --> 00:49:46.911
The infection looks bad.

870
00:49:46.911 --> 00:49:48.141
You need a doctor,

871
00:49:48.141 --> 00:49:50.081
but you're on the run... Hae Joo.

872
00:49:53.882 --> 00:49:55.382
It must hurt a lot.

873
00:49:57.052 --> 00:49:58.482
Okay. All done.

874
00:50:06.192 --> 00:50:07.431
Eng Cho.

875
00:50:10.362 --> 00:50:12.971
My goodness. When did you come?

876
00:50:13.201 --> 00:50:15.501
It's okay. Don't cry.

877
00:50:15.501 --> 00:50:18.802
It's okay. Don't cry. That's a good girl.

878
00:50:33.152 --> 00:50:34.152
Hae Joo...

879
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:37.592
She's just a good friend.

880
00:51:01.751 --> 00:51:03.282
Hey.

881
00:51:03.282 --> 00:51:06.192
You saved Jung Hee's life.

882
00:51:06.192 --> 00:51:08.521
This is all I can do to thank you.

883
00:51:08.521 --> 00:51:10.262
Eat up. Eat.

884
00:51:10.561 --> 00:51:13.791
You're not a picky eater, are you?

885
00:51:13.992 --> 00:51:17.032
Bong Soo, this brat, is so finicky.

886
00:51:17.032 --> 00:51:18.701
That's why he's so skinny.

887
00:51:19.001 --> 00:51:21.672
No. I'm not picky at all.

888
00:51:21.971 --> 00:51:22.971
Thank you.

889
00:51:22.971 --> 00:51:25.141
You look like you wouldn't be picky.

890
00:51:25.342 --> 00:51:26.342
Eat up.

891
00:51:27.512 --> 00:51:29.112
Why are you hitting him?

892
00:51:29.541 --> 00:51:30.541
Eat up.

893
00:51:30.641 --> 00:51:32.242
- What a liar. - Goodness.

894
00:51:32.242 --> 00:51:34.382
You're such a good eater.

895
00:51:34.512 --> 00:51:36.721
Here. Eat this.

896
00:51:36.721 --> 00:51:38.451
You should eat it whole,

897
00:51:38.451 --> 00:51:40.121
including the bone.

898
00:51:40.121 --> 00:51:41.221
Try it.

899
00:51:41.621 --> 00:51:43.891
That's it. Eat it all up.

900
00:51:44.362 --> 00:51:47.931
Goodness. Try some of this too.

901
00:51:47.931 --> 00:51:49.632
Here. Try this.

902
00:51:49.632 --> 00:51:50.632
Gosh.

903
00:51:51.132 --> 00:51:53.001
What a good eater.

904
00:51:53.001 --> 00:51:54.101
Eng Cho.

905
00:51:55.001 --> 00:51:56.201
Eng Cho.

906
00:51:58.601 --> 00:51:59.612
Eng Cho.

907
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:04.411
Eng Cho.

908
00:52:10.282 --> 00:52:11.422
Eng Cho!

909
00:52:12.482 --> 00:52:13.492
Your turn.

910
00:52:14.152 --> 00:52:15.221
Eng Cho!

911
00:52:18.922 --> 00:52:20.962
Have you seen Eng Cho?

912
00:52:20.992 --> 00:52:22.661
- I didn't. - No?

913
00:52:22.732 --> 00:52:23.762
No.

914
00:52:24.661 --> 00:52:26.402
- You didn't? - No, I didn't.

915
00:52:34.641 --> 00:52:36.041
A gangster doesn't become a saint...

916
00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:37.242
by living like this.

917
00:52:38.442 --> 00:52:39.482
Eng Cho!

918
00:52:41.212 --> 00:52:42.451
Young Choon.

919
00:52:45.081 --> 00:52:47.791
- Where did you go? - I was with Hae Joo.

920
00:52:48.422 --> 00:52:50.621
She braided my hair...

921
00:52:50.692 --> 00:52:52.291
pretty like this,

922
00:52:52.291 --> 00:52:54.262
- and made me donuts... - You brat.

923
00:52:54.262 --> 00:52:56.262
You brat. You little brat.

924
00:52:56.831 --> 00:52:58.302
I told you not to go there.

925
00:52:58.302 --> 00:53:00.302
You scared me. I thought you went missing.

926
00:53:00.302 --> 00:53:02.842
- Why won't you listen? - Stop.

927
00:53:04.442 --> 00:53:07.842
I'm sorry. I assumed she had told you.

928
00:53:09.271 --> 00:53:11.411
Do you think Eng Cho is a beggar?

929
00:53:12.112 --> 00:53:14.012
Did I ask you to do that?

930
00:53:19.951 --> 00:53:21.021
Let's go.

931
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:30.161
It's dark already.

932
00:53:30.262 --> 00:53:31.931
Get home quickly.

933
00:53:32.402 --> 00:53:34.701
Yes, ma'am. The food was delicious.

934
00:53:34.701 --> 00:53:35.732
Thanks.

935
00:53:35.732 --> 00:53:37.701
- See you tomorrow. - Okay.

936
00:53:37.701 --> 00:53:40.112
- Bye. Don't come back. - Shut it.

937
00:53:40.641 --> 00:53:41.672
Goodbye.

938
00:53:44.982 --> 00:53:46.512
What? Why aren't you going?

939
00:53:46.782 --> 00:53:47.982
Do you need to poop?

940
00:53:49.112 --> 00:53:51.251
No, that's not it.

941
00:53:53.021 --> 00:53:54.351
You're still here?

942
00:53:55.351 --> 00:53:56.721
- Jung Hee. - Bye.

943
00:53:57.121 --> 00:53:59.492
Look how that brat talks.

944
00:54:00.262 --> 00:54:02.791
- Bye. - Okay. Good night.

945
00:54:05.802 --> 00:54:07.771
Be careful of gangsters!

946
00:54:07.902 --> 00:54:08.931
Okay.

947
00:54:10.371 --> 00:54:12.842
He has a great voice too.

948
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:16.041
How is he so mature?

949
00:54:17.112 --> 00:54:18.742
Just make him your son-in-law.

950
00:54:18.911 --> 00:54:20.851
You don't think I will?

951
00:54:28.121 --> 00:54:29.621
Maybe I overate.

952
00:54:30.492 --> 00:54:32.621
I need a bathroom.

953
00:55:02.822 --> 00:55:04.561
Will you tell me the truth?

954
00:55:04.692 --> 00:55:07.362
What's going on between you and Jin?

955
00:55:07.362 --> 00:55:08.762
There's nothing going on between us.

956
00:55:11.561 --> 00:55:12.632
Yes.

957
00:55:13.532 --> 00:55:14.632
Let's make up.

958
00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:28.052
Jin?

959
00:55:35.391 --> 00:55:37.192
Whom is he waiting for?

960
00:55:45.802 --> 00:55:47.802
- Why are you back? - You said...

961
00:55:48.971 --> 00:55:50.802
you have no feelings for me...

962
00:55:51.641 --> 00:55:52.802
to Jung Hee?

963
00:55:54.742 --> 00:55:55.742
Yes.

964
00:55:56.342 --> 00:55:58.581
I thought I should be honest with her.

965
00:56:00.212 --> 00:56:01.251
Hae Joo.

966
00:56:01.982 --> 00:56:03.621
Why don't you understand how I feel?

967
00:56:05.251 --> 00:56:06.721
I really like you.

968
00:56:07.021 --> 00:56:09.721
I can't study because of you. My grades...

969
00:56:09.962 --> 00:56:11.161
keep falling. I'm going crazy.

970
00:56:12.092 --> 00:56:13.831
What must I do for you to like me?

971
00:56:14.661 --> 00:56:15.862
I'm sorry.

972
00:56:16.132 --> 00:56:19.462
You can't control how a person feels.

973
00:56:21.672 --> 00:56:23.201
I need to go back in.

974
00:56:24.172 --> 00:56:25.201
Good night.

975
00:56:26.572 --> 00:56:27.641
Hae Joo.

976
00:56:29.212 --> 00:56:30.311
Then...

977
00:56:31.112 --> 00:56:33.411
did he lie to me?

978
00:56:34.712 --> 00:56:35.951
How?

979
00:56:36.751 --> 00:56:37.982
How?

980
00:56:38.521 --> 00:56:39.721
Jin.

981
00:56:45.021 --> 00:56:46.092
What is it?

982
00:56:48.032 --> 00:56:49.431
Were you listening in?

983
00:56:49.431 --> 00:56:51.132
It wasn't intentional.

984
00:56:51.661 --> 00:56:54.701
Jin. Why did you lie to Jung Hee?

985
00:56:55.001 --> 00:56:56.132
What?

986
00:57:00.911 --> 00:57:02.212
I have nothing to say to you.

987
00:57:06.612 --> 00:57:09.152
You need to be clear about things like this.

988
00:57:09.251 --> 00:57:11.851
Not telling the truth to avoid hurting someone...

989
00:57:12.121 --> 00:57:14.291
- isn't for the person... - Dong Moon.

990
00:57:18.391 --> 00:57:20.762
- Leave. - I can't go like this.

991
00:57:22.291 --> 00:57:23.701
Tell Jung Hee the truth.

992
00:57:23.701 --> 00:57:25.831
Step aside. Do you want a beating?

993
00:57:25.962 --> 00:57:27.101
Want to try me?

994
00:57:28.331 --> 00:57:29.402
Shall I?

995
00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:35.771
If we fight and I beat you,

996
00:57:36.342 --> 00:57:38.282
please tell Jung Hee the truth.

997
00:57:38.282 --> 00:57:39.712
You little punk.

998
00:57:46.121 --> 00:57:48.652
Are you okay? Watch it next time.

999
00:57:50.092 --> 00:57:51.592
I'm not done yet.

1000
00:58:09.371 --> 00:58:10.442
Dong Moon.

1001
00:58:11.141 --> 00:58:12.612
Don't just study.

1002
00:58:13.382 --> 00:58:15.311
Exercise a little too.

1003
00:58:21.192 --> 00:58:22.322
See you at school.

1004
00:58:35.431 --> 00:58:36.601
That's what it was.

1005
00:58:36.601 --> 00:58:37.701
Jin!

1006
00:58:38.072 --> 00:58:39.201
I saw only...

1007
00:58:39.271 --> 00:58:41.471
- what I wanted to. - Hey.

1008
00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:43.541
I had no idea.

1009
00:58:44.811 --> 00:58:47.251
She must be in a lot of pain. Oh, no.

1010
00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:50.822
I had no idea...

1011
00:58:51.521 --> 00:58:54.052
that Jin liked Hae Joo from the start.

1012
00:59:39.771 --> 00:59:40.831
Jung Hee.

1013
00:59:40.971 --> 00:59:42.601
Who hit you?

1014
00:59:45.771 --> 00:59:48.842
I met a gangster over there earlier.

1015
00:59:49.541 --> 00:59:51.442
I would've fought back if there were one or two,

1016
00:59:52.612 --> 00:59:54.782
but eight of them jumped me at once.

1017
01:00:04.362 --> 01:00:05.462
Wipe your mouth.

1018
01:00:06.532 --> 01:00:09.391
I can't use that. It's too precious.

1019
01:00:12.262 --> 01:00:13.771
Wipe it already.

1020
01:00:16.271 --> 01:00:17.601
That hurts.

1021
01:00:21.172 --> 01:00:22.342
Are you crying?

1022
01:00:25.442 --> 01:00:28.411
Why? Because I got hurt?

1023
01:00:29.621 --> 01:00:30.951
Don't be stupid.

1024
01:00:35.822 --> 01:00:37.962
Then why?

1025
01:00:46.271 --> 01:00:47.971
I got in trouble with my dad.

1026
01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:52.101
You did?

1027
01:00:55.971 --> 01:00:57.242
Then cry.

1028
01:01:00.052 --> 01:01:01.652
You'll feel better.

1029
01:01:03.152 --> 01:01:04.322
Should I?

1030
01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:07.492
Should I cry a little?

1031
01:01:10.362 --> 01:01:11.462
Cry.

1032
01:01:13.492 --> 01:01:14.862
I'll stand guard.

1033
01:01:42.152 --> 01:01:43.661
Why are you crying?

1034
01:01:45.192 --> 01:01:46.232
I...

1035
01:01:47.632 --> 01:01:48.692
I...

1036
01:01:50.762 --> 01:01:52.762
Because the wounds hurt.

1037
01:01:54.532 --> 01:01:57.641
I'm crying because I'm so upset...

1038
01:01:58.771 --> 01:02:00.842
because I can't win your love.

1039
01:02:02.172 --> 01:02:05.512
Because I don't compare at all to Jin.

1040
01:02:07.112 --> 01:02:08.451
You should cry too.

1041
01:02:09.181 --> 01:02:10.982
You'll feel better.

1042
01:03:12.882 --> 01:03:15.451
(Girls' Generation 1979)

1043
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:18.922
Be proud and confident.

1044
01:03:18.922 --> 01:03:20.791
I'm over Jin now.

1045
01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:21.922
You mean it?

1046
01:03:22.251 --> 01:03:23.521
It's not over.

1047
01:03:23.521 --> 01:03:25.762
I won't forget your dad making me get on my knees.

1048
01:03:25.762 --> 01:03:28.661
- An after party? - Jin is coming too.

1049
01:03:29.192 --> 01:03:32.032
Did you know that Jin keeps hitting on Hae Joo?

1050
01:03:32.931 --> 01:03:35.172
- Please help me. - Sorry?

1051
01:03:35.371 --> 01:03:36.371
A study room?

1052
01:03:36.371 --> 01:03:37.371
I'll give you my pass.

1053
01:03:37.371 --> 01:03:39.612
Does that mean I'll be spending...

1054
01:03:39.612 --> 01:03:41.811
my first night with Jin tonight?
