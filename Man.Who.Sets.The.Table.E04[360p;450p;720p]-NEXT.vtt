3
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.001
I think there's been a mistake.

4
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.337
There's no one by the name of Ru Ri Lee.

5
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.775
At his house who lives together with her.

6
00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:27.677
I saw him and his girlfriend
 at that beach...

7
00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:29.179
on my way here.

8
00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:49.900
Did you eat?

9
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.635
(Episode 4)

10
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.070
What are you doing right now?

11
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.572
Can't you see? I'm packing.

12
00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:58.175
If you go now, you can follow 
your father at the airport.

13
00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:02.345
I can't. I'm not going.

14
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.715
You don't know...

15
00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.052
how scary my dad is when he's mad.

16
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.722
If I go back to Seoul right now, 
he will kill me.

17
00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:14.324
What will you do if you don't go back?

18
00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.992
Do you think you can still 
work in Guam like this?

19
00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.594
I can't accept that anymore.

20
00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:20.997
- Manager Jung. 
- It's natural that he's mad.

21
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.300
You were in an employment scam, 
lived with a man, and kissed me.

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.569
That's all a misunderstanding.

23
00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.237
So let's go and get it straight.

24
00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:29.272
It's better to face your problems head on.

25
00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:31.108
You must resolve misunderstandings 
as soon as possible.

26
00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:32.542
Let's go.

27
00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:34.344
I can't.

28
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:35.912
I'm...

29
00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:39.583
too scared to go.

30
00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:48.859
He'll still be here if it's before 
the departure process.

31
00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:50.927
I think he's not here.

32
00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:53.463
Are you really going to be like this?

33
00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:55.699
Just give me one chance.

34
00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.601
I'm too scared to go back to Korea.

35
00:01:57.601 --> 00:01:58.935
Don't worry.

36
00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:00.604
If he tries to hit you, I'll take it for you.

37
00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:02.272
It's not about that.

38
00:02:16.153 --> 00:02:18.622
Mr. Lee, Ru Ri is here.

39
00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:23.927
She wants to go with you.

40
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:26.329
If you're not finished with ticketing, I'll help you.

41
00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.670
Dad, I'll be honest and tell you about everything.

42
00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:37.908
It's my fault that I deceived you.

43
00:02:39.276 --> 00:02:42.846
But I couldn't tell you then because I was too scared.

44
00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.949
I just wanted to live freely.

45
00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:50.120
I just slept and ate at Manager Jung's house.

46
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.957
That's right. We're not in that kind of relationship.

47
00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:55.692
What about that?

48
00:02:57.127 --> 00:03:00.397
A moment ago, you were hugging each other at the sea.

49
00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:03.333
That is...

50
00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:05.869
Let me just ask you one thing.

51
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.738
Are you serious about him?

52
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.109
Or are you just enjoying your time with him?

53
00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.714
You said you would be honest.

54
00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:19.316
Tell me.

55
00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:23.019
Are you serious, or are you just having fun?

56
00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:29.092
It's serious.

57
00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.894
Really?

58
00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:34.331
What about you?

59
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:36.766
Are you serious about her?

60
00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:40.370
Tell me. What side is it?

61
00:03:43.206 --> 00:03:44.374
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:46.943
I haven't thought deeply about her.

63
00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:54.684
Is this what you call living freely?

64
00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:56.586
You were hugging and rolling around...

65
00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:59.656
with a man who isn't serious about you in the middle of the night.

66
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.259
I'm telling you again.

67
00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.462
I won't interfere with your life again.

68
00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:08.131
Live like this if you want to.

69
00:04:11.768 --> 00:04:13.403
The 29 years I spent on her is a waste.

70
00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:15.972
How could she meet a punk like that?

71
00:04:16.373 --> 00:04:20.043
He should say, "I love her", and "I'll be responsible for her".

72
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.812
No, what's the point of blaming others?

73
00:04:23.113 --> 00:04:27.217
It's all because she's like her mom. Lacking in everything she does.

74
00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.234
Here, take care of the tickets.

75
00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.238
You will arrive early in the morning.

76
00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:51.308
Talk to your father properly when you go back to Korea.

77
00:04:51.308 --> 00:04:52.475
Make sure to sort everything out.

78
00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:57.347
Promise me one thing.

79
00:04:57.847 --> 00:05:00.283
- What? - I'll come back...

80
00:05:00.283 --> 00:05:01.851
after receiving my dad's permission.

81
00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:03.486
Wait for me until then.

82
00:05:03.787 --> 00:05:06.056
Ru Ri, you don't have to try so hard.

83
00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.157
No.

84
00:05:07.924 --> 00:05:09.559
I will really come back.

85
00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:12.562
Right next to your side.

86
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:16.299
Right next to my side?

87
00:05:18.168 --> 00:05:19.469
I already know...

88
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.472
that you were lying earlier.

89
00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:26.676
I know you hid your true heart towards me...

90
00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:30.113
because of the aftereffects of the accident.

91
00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:33.983
You don't have to anymore.

92
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:39.155
It doesn't matter who you are, and what your condition is.

93
00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:42.659
Even if you have a problem sexually.

94
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.929
I'm ready to like you with all my heart.

95
00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:49.799
No, I already like you.

96
00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:54.104
So don't worry about that.

97
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.312
You really are naive.

98
00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:05.415
No, it's all my fault.

99
00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:07.851
You need to be careful who you play with.

100
00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:11.654
I don't have any aftereffects.

101
00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:14.991
At first, it was fun to see you all flustered.

102
00:06:18.528 --> 00:06:20.463
I'm really sorry.

103
00:06:21.598 --> 00:06:22.599
Then,

104
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.868
what was that?

105
00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:28.171
You kissed me on the beach.

106
00:06:29.172 --> 00:06:31.374
Were you just playing with me, just like my dad said?

107
00:06:31.374 --> 00:06:34.677
Was it because I'm a foolish girl who doesn't know her place?

108
00:06:34.677 --> 00:06:36.246
Be careful what you talk about.

109
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.716
It's hard for people to realize their own feelings.

110
00:06:40.283 --> 00:06:42.786
Honestly, I've never thought about you like that.

111
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.790
Sometimes, your behavior and words don't match.

112
00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:51.528
I was carried away by the atmosphere.

113
00:06:51.528 --> 00:06:52.595
That's okay.

114
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.099
It makes me sadder to hear such excuses.

115
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.969
It was nice to be mistaken alone.

116
00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:01.371
Be healthy.

117
00:07:02.238 --> 00:07:03.907
You can't go like this.

118
00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:08.178
Why? Does it make you feel bad since I'll remember you as a bully?

119
00:07:08.478 --> 00:07:11.848
Don't worry. We'll never see each other again.

120
00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:14.484
I will forget everything about you.

121
00:07:37.674 --> 00:07:38.808
Excuse me.

122
00:07:46.483 --> 00:07:48.485
No, Manager Jung.

123
00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:50.987
Hey.

124
00:08:28.725 --> 00:08:33.429
Ta-da. Today's breakfast menu is strawberry omelet with bread.

125
00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:35.665
Honey, eat a lot. Okay?

126
00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:38.034
You want me to eat this for breakfast?

127
00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:39.302
Why? You don't want to?

128
00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.272
I saw it coming. So I prepared something else too.

129
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.309
Here. I have chocolate and bananas. Which one would you like?

130
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:49.846
I'm going to work.

131
00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:51.781
What's the matter?

132
00:08:51.915 --> 00:08:53.016
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.686
My taste in food is quite Korean, so I prefer doenjang to baked goods...

134
00:08:57.053 --> 00:08:58.421
from a trendy bakery.

135
00:08:58.421 --> 00:09:01.524
You're ridiculous. Who's going to suit your taste?

136
00:09:01.524 --> 00:09:05.061
You should've married a girl who digs cockles in Beolgyo,

137
00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:06.829
so you can have the stew for breakfast and dinner.

138
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:10.700
Why did you marry a girl who studied overseas? Why are you making a fuss?

139
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.136
- Goodness. You're unbelievable. - She's going at it again.

140
00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.538
Mom, didn't I make myself clear?

141
00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:19.042
I told you we'll live by ourselves if you nag So Won.

142
00:09:19.776 --> 00:09:23.046
Okay. Please don't bring that up again.

143
00:09:23.446 --> 00:09:24.881
I'll keep my mouth shut.

144
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.051
You heard her, right?

145
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:31.654
Don't be so upset. Let's go to Jeju Island tonight, just the two of us.

146
00:09:32.922 --> 00:09:34.090
Why are we going there all of a sudden?

147
00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.192
I told you already.

148
00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:38.795
I said I wanted to get some fresh air and de-stress.

149
00:09:38.795 --> 00:09:40.563
Am I in any position to go on a trip?

150
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:43.633
I won't expect you to be a good daughter-in-law.

151
00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:45.335
Just don't turn me into a bad son.

152
00:09:48.938 --> 00:09:53.276
Honey, honey. Honey!

153
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.547
That guy is so negative. He's so pessimistic.

154
00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.882
What's wrong with this breakfast?

155
00:10:03.553 --> 00:10:06.556
Bring me the cold rice and fermented bean stew we had last night.

156
00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:17.667
He went to Guam to fetch Ru Ri.

157
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.139
(Beautiful Daughter)

158
00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:27.777
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

159
00:10:27.777 --> 00:10:29.445
- after the beep. - Goodness.

160
00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:33.216
Ru Ri, did you see your dad?

161
00:10:33.516 --> 00:10:36.285
I'm worried sick. Please call me back.

162
00:10:42.258 --> 00:10:43.326
Mom.

163
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:46.696
- Hi. - I'm here.

164
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.632
You should've gone straight to work. You didn't have to come again.

165
00:10:49.632 --> 00:10:51.134
I don't have surgeries scheduled this morning.

166
00:10:51.668 --> 00:10:53.336
Father hasn't called back, has he?

167
00:10:53.936 --> 00:10:56.839
I can't reach him either. I don't know what's going on.

168
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.541
I'm hoping nothing has happened.

169
00:10:59.308 --> 00:11:00.777
Don't worry.

170
00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:02.578
Taking a few days off won't be a problem for Ru Ri.

171
00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:05.148
You don't know anything.

172
00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:07.383
It won't be easy to find Ru Ri either.

173
00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.385
What are you talking about?

174
00:11:11.888 --> 00:11:15.324
Ru Ri isn't working at Guam Visitors Bureau.

175
00:11:19.996 --> 00:11:21.931
- You're back. - Yes.

176
00:11:28.137 --> 00:11:29.172
Where's Ru Ri?

177
00:11:29.172 --> 00:11:32.942
She's not part of this family anymore. Don't even bring her up.

178
00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:34.777
What do you mean?

179
00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:36.579
Did something happen in Guam?

180
00:11:36.846 --> 00:11:39.415
It's bitter to even talk about what happened. So I won't.

181
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.752
She got a job at Guam Visitors Bureau?

182
00:11:44.387 --> 00:11:47.423
She was conning us. It was all a lie.

183
00:11:47.523 --> 00:11:48.891
That ungrateful brat.

184
00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:51.794
What? Then why did she go to Guam?

185
00:11:55.064 --> 00:11:57.200
What happened? Mom, you know what happened, don't you?

186
00:12:01.671 --> 00:12:05.208
Honey, you should try to understand her.

187
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:09.946
Ru Ri's initial intention wasn't to lie to us.

188
00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:12.749
She couldn't get a job again.

189
00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:16.185
She did that because she was worried that you'd be disappointed in her.

190
00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:18.788
Think how miserable she must've been been to willingly commit suicide.

191
00:12:18.788 --> 00:12:22.658
I thought something horrible was going to happen. So I let her.

192
00:12:22.892 --> 00:12:25.828
For three years, she suffered a great deal to get a job.

193
00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:28.564
I told her to go because I wanted her to relax.

194
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:32.301
So Ru Ri did nothing wrong. Everything is my fault.

195
00:12:32.435 --> 00:12:34.570
- How dare you! - Father.

196
00:12:36.038 --> 00:12:41.277
So you two plotted this scheme...

197
00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:43.446
and deceived me?

198
00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.781
Honey.

199
00:12:44.781 --> 00:12:47.283
Do you know what you've done?

200
00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:51.420
You need to think of ways to teach her when she made a mistake.

201
00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:54.657
How can you, her mother, ruin her chance at having a future?

202
00:12:54.657 --> 00:12:57.059
What are you talking about? How did I ruin her future?

203
00:12:57.059 --> 00:12:58.194
Do you have to ask?

204
00:12:58.795 --> 00:13:01.330
Right now, that brat...

205
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.767
is living with a guy whom we never heard of in Guam.

206
00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.170
- What? - It was all for nothing.

207
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.206
You ruined our precious daughter whom I raised with all my effort.

208
00:13:11.073 --> 00:13:15.545
Goodness, this is why I should've checked the IQ of the bride.

209
00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:18.781
Since you are so stupid,

210
00:13:18.781 --> 00:13:22.685
your daughter is doing only foolish things.

211
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.153
Mom.

212
00:13:25.021 --> 00:13:27.557
Honey, that's not true.

213
00:13:27.957 --> 00:13:29.592
I'm sure that was a misunderstanding.

214
00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:34.263
Ru Ri wouldn't do such a thing. She wouldn't do that.

215
00:13:34.263 --> 00:13:35.565
Quit dreaming!

216
00:13:35.932 --> 00:13:38.134
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

217
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:42.538
They were kissing and all over each other.

218
00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:44.273
Oh, dear.

219
00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:47.009
Goodness, I was so embarrassed of her.

220
00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:50.046
That's not true! I trust Ru Ri.

221
00:13:51.314 --> 00:13:52.815
That's not like her.

222
00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:55.418
Even if that's true, I'm certain she had a good reason for it.

223
00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:57.453
A good reason, my foot!

224
00:13:58.387 --> 00:14:00.957
We don't need to talk anymore. Get out.

225
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.393
I don't need someone who deceives in my own house...

226
00:14:04.393 --> 00:14:06.662
which I bought with the money I personally earned.

227
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.633
Whether it's marriage graduation or divorce, I'll do whatever you want.

228
00:14:10.666 --> 00:14:11.901
So get out of this house right now.

229
00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.704
- Honey. - I told you to get out!

230
00:14:16.305 --> 00:14:19.275
I'll leave, but not like this. You can't kick me out.

231
00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:23.579
I'll straighten things out for Ru Ri and leave this house on my own will.

232
00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:24.914
No way.

233
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:28.050
You caused a colossal disaster.

234
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.919
But now you want to straighten things out? Forget it.

235
00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:31.520
You don't have the right to do that.

236
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:34.423
- Please calm down. - Okay, okay.

237
00:14:34.423 --> 00:14:37.226
Leave now. Get out of my house right now.

238
00:14:40.062 --> 00:14:42.431
Am I a joke to you?

239
00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:45.534
You know what? Come here.

240
00:14:45.534 --> 00:14:48.804
I said I'll do whatever you want. Why aren't you leaving?

241
00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:50.139
- Let go of me. - Why?

242
00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:52.174
- Get out of my house. - Goodness!

243
00:14:52.174 --> 00:14:53.709
What's gotten into you?

244
00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:56.012
Get out. Leave now.

245
00:14:56.178 --> 00:14:57.947
Father, please calm down. Compose yourself.

246
00:14:57.947 --> 00:14:59.815
- Father! - Get out!

247
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:09.825
Gosh, it hurts.

248
00:15:11.294 --> 00:15:12.662
Unbelievable.

249
00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:17.066
Hey, Hong Young Hye! You're listening, aren't you?

250
00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:23.306
I don't ever want to see you again.

251
00:15:23.406 --> 00:15:25.341
Don't dare set foot in this neighborhood.

252
00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:30.313
Starting this point, I have neither a wife nor a daughter.

253
00:15:31.747 --> 00:15:34.050
The only family I have is So Won.

254
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.685
Get that?

255
00:15:35.918 --> 00:15:37.153
Did you get that?

256
00:16:01.677 --> 00:16:02.778
Get up.

257
00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:07.383
What did your father say?

258
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.519
I don't think he would've kept quiet. I know how he is.

259
00:16:11.253 --> 00:16:14.423
Where is Ru Ri? How is she doing now?

260
00:16:14.423 --> 00:16:15.825
How can you worry about her now?

261
00:16:16.292 --> 00:16:18.761
Haven't you thought about how shocked he is?

262
00:16:20.196 --> 00:16:22.431
You let that foolish girl live overseas.

263
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:24.033
I bet she's just wasting her life there.

264
00:16:24.533 --> 00:16:27.169
How can you be just like your father?

265
00:16:27.436 --> 00:16:30.539
Okay, I get it. It's all my fault. You don't need to blame Ru Ri.

266
00:16:31.674 --> 00:16:33.676
- Where are you going? - That's not your concern.

267
00:16:33.676 --> 00:16:34.910
You have no place to go.

268
00:16:37.046 --> 00:16:38.180
Come with me.

269
00:16:51.127 --> 00:16:56.298
Look at you. Why are you crying?

270
00:16:56.565 --> 00:16:59.168
You're breaking my heart.

271
00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:00.336
Mom.

272
00:17:00.669 --> 00:17:04.507
It doesn't matter how hard I try. I can't make him love me.

273
00:17:04.807 --> 00:17:07.009
- Goodness. - I wanted to be a good wife,

274
00:17:07.009 --> 00:17:10.880
so I cooked him breakfast and planned our trip.

275
00:17:12.515 --> 00:17:14.784
But I think So Won really hates me.

276
00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:18.120
Why do you like that doctor so much anyway?

277
00:17:18.888 --> 00:17:21.557
Mom, this is just between us.

278
00:17:21.857 --> 00:17:24.593
I'm not that smart as you know.

279
00:17:25.061 --> 00:17:28.364
When I see him reading a book,

280
00:17:28.597 --> 00:17:30.866
I go crazy because he's so hot.

281
00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:32.868
This is ridiculous.

282
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.806
He used to be so good to me at first.

283
00:17:38.507 --> 00:17:40.076
Why is he so mean now?

284
00:17:40.109 --> 00:17:41.310
Hold on.

285
00:17:42.244 --> 00:17:43.546
It's been about four years...

286
00:17:43.546 --> 00:17:45.448
- since you've been married, right? - Yes.

287
00:17:45.448 --> 00:17:48.317
It's about time for you guys to reach the stage of ennui.

288
00:17:48.384 --> 00:17:51.053
"The stage of ennui"? What should I do, Mom?

289
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.488
Get pregnant.

290
00:17:53.556 --> 00:17:54.690
Pregnant?

291
00:17:57.226 --> 00:17:58.294
Come in.

292
00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:04.300
Whose house is this?

293
00:18:04.366 --> 00:18:05.801
This is my second house.

294
00:18:06.869 --> 00:18:08.370
Second house?

295
00:18:09.105 --> 00:18:10.506
There's nothing to be surprised about.

296
00:18:11.574 --> 00:18:14.543
We repeat a routine endlessly, so I bought that.

297
00:18:14.543 --> 00:18:17.880
It didn't feel like my home and it was suffocating.

298
00:18:18.547 --> 00:18:20.316
So Won, are you...

299
00:18:20.316 --> 00:18:22.051
Am I regretting getting married?

300
00:18:22.218 --> 00:18:24.987
No, I'm thankful to Father.

301
00:18:25.087 --> 00:18:27.289
I almost got ruined after breaking up with Su Mi.

302
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:30.259
I came to my senses after Father introduced Yeon Ju to me.

303
00:18:30.826 --> 00:18:33.062
It was also the best from a practical viewpoint.

304
00:18:33.062 --> 00:18:34.964
"A practical viewpoint"?

305
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:38.334
Is marriage a business, to think about profit?

306
00:18:38.767 --> 00:18:40.970
You should've got married because you're in love.

307
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.639
It's funny that you're saying that.

308
00:18:44.573 --> 00:18:48.144
Didn't you marry Father despite Grandfather's opposition?

309
00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:50.646
Looking at you right now,

310
00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:53.215
I think my choice was wiser than yours.

311
00:19:04.593 --> 00:19:06.128
My goodness.

312
00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:09.064
They're so disrespectful.

313
00:19:10.699 --> 00:19:14.336
They are so ungrateful.

314
00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:31.487
My gosh.

315
00:19:38.994 --> 00:19:40.095
Oh, my.

316
00:19:48.504 --> 00:19:49.538
Hey.

317
00:19:50.306 --> 00:19:52.808
Hong Young Hye. Lee Ru Ri.

318
00:19:53.209 --> 00:19:55.544
Why are you at my house?

319
00:19:55.945 --> 00:20:00.549
Pigs will fly before I ever...

320
00:20:00.716 --> 00:20:05.254
forgive you two.

321
00:20:05.854 --> 00:20:07.056
Come here.

322
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:13.395
Why am I so dizzy?

323
00:20:15.364 --> 00:20:16.532
Come here.

324
00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:18.033
Goodness.

325
00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:23.339
What is wrong with me?

326
00:20:28.344 --> 00:20:29.645
My head hurts.

327
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.215
It hurts.

328
00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:04.546
Mom?

329
00:21:05.748 --> 00:21:06.782
Mom?

330
00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:08.550
Mom?

331
00:21:09.285 --> 00:21:10.386
Mom?

332
00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:11.987
Mom?

333
00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:15.624
Where did she go?

334
00:21:18.394 --> 00:21:20.529
I need to see her first.

335
00:21:39.982 --> 00:21:42.851
Dad.

336
00:21:42.985 --> 00:21:45.587
Dad, wake up.

337
00:21:45.788 --> 00:21:47.189
Mom.

338
00:21:48.891 --> 00:21:51.026
Dad.

339
00:21:53.796 --> 00:21:55.564
What should we do?

340
00:21:57.766 --> 00:22:01.036
Just leave me alone. That's helping me.

341
00:22:01.036 --> 00:22:02.938
Okay, I trust you.

342
00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:05.974
Oh, my. What happened?

343
00:22:06.342 --> 00:22:07.710
It's hot.

344
00:22:08.477 --> 00:22:10.546
Hey. Oh, my.

345
00:22:12.815 --> 00:22:15.050
Why are you in the kitchen? Where is your dad?

346
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:16.051
He went to work out.

347
00:22:16.051 --> 00:22:18.554
He must be stressed after Grandma visited.

348
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.023
He exercises like crazy whenever he's worried about something.

349
00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:24.760
Wait, I'll make you instant noodles.

350
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.964
Mom, did you hear anything from him?

351
00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:32.601
Is Grandma a monster?

352
00:22:32.701 --> 00:22:35.337
How strange is she for him to treat her like that?

353
00:22:35.337 --> 00:22:37.139
Is this your first time seeing her?

354
00:22:37.306 --> 00:22:39.041
I didn't know she existed.

355
00:22:39.241 --> 00:22:42.945
We're in big trouble. I have a bad feeling about her.

356
00:22:52.955 --> 00:22:56.625
It's worth the visit seeing you this angry.

357
00:22:57.059 --> 00:22:59.328
Hate is also a form of love.

358
00:23:00.896 --> 00:23:04.533
Hey, wait for me.

359
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.335
Hey.

360
00:23:43.305 --> 00:23:45.474
Hi, Go Jung Do.

361
00:23:45.707 --> 00:23:48.610
I think you have 30 minutes left until your class.

362
00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.078
Let's go somewhere and talk.

363
00:23:51.246 --> 00:23:53.816
Should I go to your classroom?

364
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.324
Drink.

365
00:24:02.825 --> 00:24:05.360
Mango juice isn't that bad these days.

366
00:24:06.228 --> 00:24:07.262
Drink it all.

367
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.065
I'm allergic to mangoes.

368
00:24:11.266 --> 00:24:14.536
How could a mother not know what her child is allergic to?

369
00:24:14.736 --> 00:24:16.004
But...

370
00:24:16.004 --> 00:24:19.274
I'm here as a senior of the industry, not your mother.

371
00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:21.276
Senior?

372
00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:28.450
What do you want, Senior Choi?

373
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.986
Do you hate me that much?

374
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.288
I'll leave if you don't have anything to say.

375
00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:36.525
People must live according to their conditions.

376
00:24:37.192 --> 00:24:39.561
It's funny when a crow-tit tries to walk like a stork.

377
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:42.064
But it's funnier when a stork tries to imitate a crow-tit.

378
00:24:42.064 --> 00:24:45.267
It's only funny in your eyes. I don't have any complaints.

379
00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:48.570
Your house is about to collapse, and you're living with an old lady.

380
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.740
Do you think it suits you...

381
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.375
taking care of that lady's kids and being tired?

382
00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:56.044
What do you even know about us to thoughtlessly talk like that?

383
00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:57.813
Do you have any right to do so?

384
00:24:57.813 --> 00:24:58.881
Why don't I?

385
00:24:58.881 --> 00:25:02.150
Like it or not, I gave birth to you. You're my child.

386
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.253
I have enough right to interfere with your life...

387
00:25:04.253 --> 00:25:06.188
since I gave birth to you.

388
00:25:06.188 --> 00:25:09.057
If you wanted to interfere, you should've done it earlier.

389
00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:12.060
When I needed a mother.

390
00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:14.830
When Father needed a wife.

391
00:25:15.297 --> 00:25:17.065
Where were you then?

392
00:25:17.499 --> 00:25:19.735
You were moving from one young man to another.

393
00:25:20.469 --> 00:25:23.238
Are you starting to think of your children...

394
00:25:23.405 --> 00:25:25.307
because you're old and young men aren't interested in you?

395
00:25:27.876 --> 00:25:29.311
10 years ago,

396
00:25:30.045 --> 00:25:32.281
2 people died because of you.

397
00:25:32.848 --> 00:25:35.751
The moment my brother and his wife died because of you,

398
00:25:36.585 --> 00:25:38.220
you were also dead to me.

399
00:25:38.253 --> 00:25:41.290
So don't you dare appear in front of me again.

400
00:25:41.557 --> 00:25:44.126
How much salary do you want?

401
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:47.296
I can give you 10 times more than your salary.

402
00:25:50.232 --> 00:25:51.533
Don't you know?

403
00:25:51.533 --> 00:25:55.237
I gave up my life in Japan to achieve a goal in Korea.

404
00:25:55.604 --> 00:25:57.639
I'm here to develop SC Food and Beverage.

405
00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:59.641
If you work with me,

406
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:02.311
it will only be a matter of time to become the top of the industry.

407
00:26:04.746 --> 00:26:06.048
(SC Food and Beverage, Seoga and Cook)

408
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:10.819
Is that why you wanted to see me?

409
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.957
If you don't like me, you can completely treat me as a senior.

410
00:26:14.957 --> 00:26:16.692
Just as I suspected.

411
00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:20.329
I thought you gained a conscience after getting older.

412
00:26:20.696 --> 00:26:22.798
But now you're just trying to use your child.

413
00:26:23.865 --> 00:26:26.535
It's too bad. I'm different from Father.

414
00:26:26.969 --> 00:26:29.304
Father loved you until the moment he died.

415
00:26:29.304 --> 00:26:31.373
He gave you everything.

416
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:34.309
The only thing I can offer you is hatred.

417
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.646
So never appear in front of me again.

418
00:26:49.958 --> 00:26:50.959
What is this?

419
00:26:50.959 --> 00:26:52.794
They are chairman Kevin's special orders.

420
00:26:52.794 --> 00:26:54.796
In case you failed at recruiting Go Jung Do,

421
00:26:54.796 --> 00:26:56.398
he said he would recruit a new menu developer.

422
00:26:56.398 --> 00:26:58.600
A newbie can't handle this.

423
00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.735
That's why...

424
00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.639
you should hurry Go Jung Do's recruitment.

425
00:27:03.639 --> 00:27:06.008
What happened to the orders I made?

426
00:27:06.274 --> 00:27:08.877
I told you to find information on Jang Hwa Young.

427
00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:10.646
I will report to you within the day.

428
00:27:10.646 --> 00:27:11.747
Hurry.

429
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.616
That woman is the only thing to defeat Jung Do.

430
00:27:24.826 --> 00:27:26.595
- So Won. - Mom.

431
00:27:27.095 --> 00:27:28.797
- Mom. - Ru Ri.

432
00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:32.968
It's okay. Everything will be fine.

433
00:27:34.436 --> 00:27:36.338
- What about your dad? - He's still in examination.

434
00:27:36.338 --> 00:27:37.806
Is he conscious?

435
00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:42.511
We're fortunate that Ru Ri found him quickly.

436
00:27:42.878 --> 00:27:44.379
It's all because of me.

437
00:27:44.379 --> 00:27:47.049
I upset him, so this happened.

438
00:27:47.349 --> 00:27:48.784
Don't say anything like that.

439
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.953
That's not what happened, so don't say anything like that.

440
00:27:52.354 --> 00:27:54.790
Your dad is strong. Don't worry.

441
00:27:55.691 --> 00:27:56.958
Let's wait and see.

442
00:28:10.338 --> 00:28:11.473
There.

443
00:28:16.211 --> 00:28:17.312
Okay.

444
00:28:19.915 --> 00:28:21.550
- Hi. - Hi.

445
00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:22.784
Next week is the busiest week,

446
00:28:22.784 --> 00:28:26.321
so we train the new employees quickly and let them start working.

447
00:28:29.825 --> 00:28:32.527
- Police. - Is this the police car?

448
00:28:32.527 --> 00:28:34.296
Smile.

449
00:28:34.896 --> 00:28:36.031
What's up?

450
00:28:37.199 --> 00:28:38.300
Is something there?

451
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.836
Hey, where are you going?

452
00:28:40.836 --> 00:28:41.937
Ru Ri.

453
00:28:43.004 --> 00:28:44.306
What's the matter?

454
00:28:46.308 --> 00:28:47.442
I'm sorry.

455
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:55.784
Did she arrive in Seoul safely?

456
00:28:57.786 --> 00:28:59.855
It looked like her dad had quite a temper.

457
00:29:00.288 --> 00:29:01.556
I hope everything's okay.

458
00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.696
I can't believe I'm worried about a girl who has left.

459
00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:36.558
How is he?

460
00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:39.060
I have the test results.

461
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.529
Was it a stroke?

462
00:29:40.962 --> 00:29:42.330
The worst is over.

463
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:45.033
It was a transient ischemic attack.

464
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.002
What is that?

465
00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:50.972
It's a smaller stroke with temporary blockage of cerebrovascular.

466
00:29:52.274 --> 00:29:53.375
Does he need surgery?

467
00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:55.610
No, it's not that serious. I can cure it with medicines.

468
00:29:56.545 --> 00:29:58.747
Is my dad going to be all right?

469
00:29:58.814 --> 00:30:02.350
Yes, we will be medicating him for 4 to 5 days at the hospital.

470
00:30:02.651 --> 00:30:04.219
Thank you, Doctor.

471
00:30:04.786 --> 00:30:07.255
It might recur, so we might need to examine him further.

472
00:30:08.256 --> 00:30:09.791
Thank you.

473
00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:20.836
Father. Father.

474
00:30:25.807 --> 00:30:27.008
Are you all right?

475
00:30:27.809 --> 00:30:29.945
Do you know where you are?

476
00:30:49.898 --> 00:30:52.467
Shin Mo, don't worry.

477
00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:55.203
It's a temporary paralysis. You'll get better soon.

478
00:30:55.203 --> 00:30:57.439
Just relax and rest.

479
00:30:57.439 --> 00:30:58.607
That's right, Dad.

480
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.443
You are going to be okay. It's a relief.

481
00:31:03.478 --> 00:31:06.147
What is he saying?

482
00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:08.817
Wait. What are you saying?

483
00:31:10.752 --> 00:31:12.821
Your back?

484
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:16.992
His back must be hurting.

485
00:31:16.992 --> 00:31:18.360
He must have hurt it when he fell.

486
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.595
Shin Mo, does your back hurt?

487
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:23.965
Move a little. I'll do something. What should I do for you?

488
00:31:26.835 --> 00:31:28.036
Mom, are you all right?

489
00:31:33.808 --> 00:31:36.811
Mom, Father must be upset to see you here.

490
00:31:36.811 --> 00:31:38.513
- I think you should go outside. - So Won.

491
00:31:38.546 --> 00:31:39.614
Now.

492
00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:45.387
All right. I'll get some things from the house.

493
00:31:45.754 --> 00:31:46.855
Let's go.

494
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.268
You scumbags.

495
00:32:04.906 --> 00:32:06.007
Mom.

496
00:32:07.075 --> 00:32:08.777
I told you so.

497
00:32:08.977 --> 00:32:12.380
He fell because of me. He must have been stressed because of me.

498
00:32:13.048 --> 00:32:14.849
That's why he can't forgive me.

499
00:32:14.849 --> 00:32:16.384
Don't say that.

500
00:32:16.384 --> 00:32:18.019
It's not your fault.

501
00:32:19.721 --> 00:32:23.825
If he collapsed due to stress,

502
00:32:24.793 --> 00:32:26.094
it's all my fault.

503
00:32:27.562 --> 00:32:32.767
I asked him for a marriage graduation.

504
00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:35.236
Mom.

505
00:32:36.972 --> 00:32:39.975
I feel sorry for you and So Won, but I did.

506
00:32:42.444 --> 00:32:43.845
Let me ask you one thing.

507
00:32:44.446 --> 00:32:46.014
Your father said...

508
00:32:46.614 --> 00:32:49.784
that you were with a man when you were at Guam.

509
00:32:49.784 --> 00:32:52.787
No, Mom. It's over.

510
00:32:53.188 --> 00:32:56.291
I don't know what Dad told you, but it's nothing like that.

511
00:32:56.624 --> 00:33:00.295
I just liked him by myself because I thought he was a good man.

512
00:33:01.997 --> 00:33:03.865
It was over before it even began.

513
00:33:04.099 --> 00:33:07.135
Then are you okay now?

514
00:33:09.337 --> 00:33:10.739
Dad was right.

515
00:33:11.539 --> 00:33:13.308
I must be really stupid.

516
00:33:13.708 --> 00:33:16.778
My love is always one-sided and ends badly.

517
00:33:17.445 --> 00:33:19.647
I must be really stupid,

518
00:33:19.914 --> 00:33:23.718
or maybe it's just that I don't have any charms as a woman.

519
00:33:24.953 --> 00:33:26.287
That's me.

520
00:33:27.989 --> 00:33:29.991
My goodness.

521
00:33:34.396 --> 00:33:36.998
They must not know you very well.

522
00:33:37.532 --> 00:33:40.735
You're really adorable and lovely.

523
00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:50.145
One day, you will meet a man who recognizes who you really are.

524
00:33:52.714 --> 00:33:53.815
Let's go.

525
00:34:03.691 --> 00:34:07.729
It doesn't matter who you are, and what your condition is.

526
00:34:07.896 --> 00:34:10.165
Even if you have a problem sexually.

527
00:34:10.665 --> 00:34:13.001
I'm ready to like you with all my heart.

528
00:34:13.268 --> 00:34:14.402
No,

529
00:34:16.104 --> 00:34:17.906
I already like you.

530
00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:33.855
If you're looking at the photo of a girl who has left,

531
00:34:33.855 --> 00:34:35.957
it means you still have feelings for her.

532
00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:39.727
Should I call Ru Ri for you?

533
00:34:39.994 --> 00:34:41.796
"I didn't really mean it."

534
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.566
"I missed you after you left."

535
00:34:44.799 --> 00:34:47.936
"We should get together again."

536
00:34:49.938 --> 00:34:51.072
Don't act up.

537
00:34:51.306 --> 00:34:52.440
Why are you here?

538
00:34:53.441 --> 00:34:56.444
I've come here to look for men as I'm not working today.

539
00:34:56.711 --> 00:34:57.979
I am free today.

540
00:34:57.979 --> 00:35:00.748
That's good news. You must have plenty of time,

541
00:35:01.249 --> 00:35:02.884
so let's go on a date with me tonight.

542
00:35:05.787 --> 00:35:08.256
Date?

543
00:35:08.456 --> 00:35:11.326
Gosh, he must be a player.

544
00:35:11.459 --> 00:35:14.362
After Ru Ri, is it my turn now?

545
00:35:14.996 --> 00:35:16.131
I love it.

546
00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:20.435
Ru Ri, I'm sorry.

547
00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.876
We should get some lotion.

548
00:35:32.981 --> 00:35:36.184
Mom, are you really going to leave Dad?

549
00:35:36.751 --> 00:35:37.919
For real?

550
00:35:40.588 --> 00:35:42.123
You understand me, right?

551
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.461
You know better than anyone else what my life was like.

552
00:35:46.995 --> 00:35:48.563
To be honest,

553
00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:52.901
I really want to stop you because I don't want you two to part.

554
00:35:53.768 --> 00:35:55.436
But I know that I shouldn't.

555
00:35:56.204 --> 00:35:58.706
If you live like this, you will be sick someday.

556
00:36:00.808 --> 00:36:03.711
I know that you are taking medications.

557
00:36:04.145 --> 00:36:05.547
It's not like that.

558
00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:09.918
I take them when it gets too hard.

559
00:36:14.822 --> 00:36:16.090
Gosh.

560
00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.860
The wounds get festered because you are stressed.

561
00:36:19.227 --> 00:36:21.229
But Dad doesn't know anything.

562
00:36:21.229 --> 00:36:23.798
Don't mention this to Dad.

563
00:36:24.165 --> 00:36:26.134
Did you hear what the doctor said?

564
00:36:26.134 --> 00:36:28.069
He's on strict bed-rest.

565
00:36:28.937 --> 00:36:32.040
The worst is over this time, but it can recur.

566
00:36:32.974 --> 00:36:37.111
What's most important right now is your dad's health.

567
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:39.147
Don't worry him, okay?

568
00:36:47.055 --> 00:36:48.156
Mom.

569
00:36:49.824 --> 00:36:51.326
I am on your side.

570
00:36:52.794 --> 00:36:55.730
I want you to be happy from now on.

571
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.905
Try to pull as hard as you can.

572
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.941
Okay.

573
00:37:06.941 --> 00:37:08.676
Try to pull your tongue out.

574
00:37:10.378 --> 00:37:11.646
I'm so relieved.

575
00:37:12.247 --> 00:37:15.316
I was worried because your tongue was tilted to one side at first.

576
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.685
It's easier for you to speak now, right?

577
00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:19.087
Try speaking.

578
00:37:20.855 --> 00:37:24.359
Peter piper picked...

579
00:37:26.494 --> 00:37:27.996
a peck of...

580
00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:31.499
I can't pronounce well.

581
00:37:31.766 --> 00:37:33.268
That's good enough.

582
00:37:33.434 --> 00:37:35.136
You walk much better,

583
00:37:35.236 --> 00:37:37.205
although your left leg is still stiff.

584
00:37:37.205 --> 00:37:39.474
But it will get better after you wake up tomorrow.

585
00:37:39.874 --> 00:37:41.175
You should take some rest.

586
00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:42.977
- I'll get going. - Thank you.

587
00:37:44.979 --> 00:37:46.114
Goodbye.

588
00:37:50.084 --> 00:37:53.788
I saw Susie sitting...

589
00:37:53.955 --> 00:37:59.727
in a shoe shine shop. Where she sits she shines...

590
00:38:00.395 --> 00:38:03.865
Gosh, why can't I pronounce words?

591
00:38:04.065 --> 00:38:06.000
It's really hard to pronounce.

592
00:38:06.434 --> 00:38:08.236
Peter Piper picked...

593
00:38:08.236 --> 00:38:09.671
It's not easy for me either.

594
00:38:09.904 --> 00:38:11.506
You don't need to worry anymore.

595
00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:13.207
You're very lucky.

596
00:38:13.308 --> 00:38:15.276
You're only paralyzed temporarily for 24 hours.

597
00:38:15.343 --> 00:38:18.546
Does that mean I'm okay?

598
00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.316
Can I be relieved?

599
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.420
It's not a stroke, is it?

600
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.323
Father, this is the chance.

601
00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:30.792
This is the chance to stop Mom.

602
00:38:31.826 --> 00:38:34.495
So you should forgive her now.

603
00:38:34.495 --> 00:38:36.397
No way.

604
00:38:36.664 --> 00:38:39.267
I'll never see your mom or Ru Ri again...

605
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.438
even if I die.

606
00:38:43.504 --> 00:38:46.341
Then you'll end up having a stroke.

607
00:38:46.374 --> 00:38:48.176
You were lucky this time,

608
00:38:48.176 --> 00:38:49.711
but there's 30 percent of recurrence within a year.

609
00:38:49.711 --> 00:38:51.212
- Is that what you want? - What?

610
00:38:53.247 --> 00:38:55.383
30 percent?

611
00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:58.186
You need to manage your diet and exercise from now on.

612
00:38:58.286 --> 00:39:01.456
Someone needs to take you to the hospital if you show signs again.

613
00:39:01.522 --> 00:39:03.091
You can't do that alone.

614
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:05.727
I'll hire a nurse.

615
00:39:05.727 --> 00:39:08.396
No one would look after you all day long.

616
00:39:08.629 --> 00:39:11.165
You can't even cook ramyeon. How will you live alone...

617
00:39:11.165 --> 00:39:13.167
when you have a bomb inside your head?

618
00:39:14.635 --> 00:39:16.938
If you want to enjoy the rest of your life,

619
00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:18.706
don't let Mom leave you.

620
00:39:19.307 --> 00:39:20.675
That's the only way.

621
00:39:21.542 --> 00:39:23.945
Where are you going?

622
00:39:24.145 --> 00:39:26.381
I'm going home. I have my own family.

623
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.518
Mom will be here soon.

624
00:39:32.687 --> 00:39:34.555
I don't need her.

625
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:36.858
I don't want to see her.

626
00:39:44.999 --> 00:39:48.169
Honey. I just had a shower.

627
00:39:51.606 --> 00:39:53.307
- Yeon Ju. - Yes, honey?

628
00:39:53.608 --> 00:39:55.376
- Turn the light off. - Already?

629
00:39:57.245 --> 00:39:58.379
Okay.

630
00:40:07.321 --> 00:40:09.724
Goodnight. I'm tired. I'll sleep first.

631
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.768
Are you that tired?

632
00:40:22.336 --> 00:40:25.106
I'm a human vitamin. I'll make you feel better.

633
00:40:25.206 --> 00:40:26.874
I love you.

634
00:40:27.542 --> 00:40:30.211
Go to sleep. My back hurts.

635
00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:40.154
Back? Let me see. I'll give you a massage.

636
00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:41.823
Here.

637
00:40:48.596 --> 00:40:49.797
For goodness' sake.

638
00:40:52.433 --> 00:40:54.535
- Honey. - How many times do I need say it?

639
00:40:54.569 --> 00:40:56.704
I'm tired. I'm exhausted.

640
00:40:56.838 --> 00:40:58.439
I don't expect anything from you,

641
00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:01.976
but just let me get some rest when I get home.

642
00:41:04.645 --> 00:41:07.315
Do you know what you say to me most often?

643
00:41:07.648 --> 00:41:10.184
All you say is that you're tired.

644
00:41:10.318 --> 00:41:12.353
Is this why I married you?

645
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.590
We don't even talk for 30 minutes in a day.

646
00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.925
I can't even remember the last time we slept together.

647
00:41:19.126 --> 00:41:20.795
What am I to you?

648
00:41:20.995 --> 00:41:22.230
Do you even see me as a woman?

649
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.764
It's been four years since we got married.

650
00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:26.334
Do you expect me to get excited every time I see you?

651
00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:28.169
Grow up, please.

652
00:41:29.403 --> 00:41:30.805
Let's have a baby.

653
00:41:35.343 --> 00:41:36.644
You're in the stage of ennui.

654
00:41:36.644 --> 00:41:38.379
A baby is the only way to fix it.

655
00:41:38.479 --> 00:41:39.981
I'll get pregnant.

656
00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:41.816
A baby isn't the solution.

657
00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:45.520
Please realize what's going on for goodness' sake.

658
00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.456
I've had a long day because of Father,

659
00:41:48.556 --> 00:41:50.224
so please leave me alone!

660
00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:56.063
Hey, what did you just say?

661
00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:59.433
What do you mean you had a long day because of your father?

662
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.835
You were eavesdropping?

663
00:42:00.835 --> 00:42:02.770
That's not the point.

664
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:05.439
Is your father all right?

665
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.475
Father's in the hospital.

666
00:42:07.975 --> 00:42:09.110
He had a stroke.

667
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.246
Oh, my goodness.

668
00:42:12.246 --> 00:42:14.115
Why didn't you tell me?

669
00:42:14.115 --> 00:42:15.483
I didn't have a chance.

670
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:18.019
You only fuss. You're no help.

671
00:42:18.019 --> 00:42:20.588
What? What did you just say?

672
00:42:20.588 --> 00:42:21.756
Say that again.

673
00:42:21.756 --> 00:42:24.358
I can't believe what you just said.

674
00:42:24.358 --> 00:42:27.395
Father-in-law is in the hospital,

675
00:42:27.395 --> 00:42:29.630
but his daughter-in-law is no help to him?

676
00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:33.834
I know she loves you more than you love her,

677
00:42:33.935 --> 00:42:35.536
but how could you treat her like that?

678
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:38.606
Don't look down on her.

679
00:42:38.706 --> 00:42:42.343
- Mother. - I know we're not educated,

680
00:42:42.376 --> 00:42:45.146
but you should still show respect to us.

681
00:42:45.146 --> 00:42:47.915
- Mom. - I'm not only upset...

682
00:42:48.015 --> 00:42:50.251
because of this.

683
00:42:50.384 --> 00:42:53.454
I've never seen you smiling...

684
00:42:53.454 --> 00:42:55.156
anytime of the day.

685
00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:58.359
I opened a hospital for you in the middle of Gangnam.

686
00:42:58.359 --> 00:43:00.861
I bought you a grand house in Cheongdam-dong.

687
00:43:00.861 --> 00:43:02.296
What's your problem?

688
00:43:02.363 --> 00:43:06.500
Are you looking down on your wife...

689
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.903
because she's so nice to you?

690
00:43:08.936 --> 00:43:11.105
If you knew any better,

691
00:43:11.105 --> 00:43:14.108
you should kneel down to me...

692
00:43:14.108 --> 00:43:16.243
and thank me every day.

693
00:43:16.377 --> 00:43:18.245
I don't know what you want.

694
00:43:18.245 --> 00:43:20.314
- Mom, let's go. - One more thing.

695
00:43:20.314 --> 00:43:23.184
If your rich mother-in-law treated you nicely,

696
00:43:23.184 --> 00:43:27.588
you should return the favor. That's the way of life.

697
00:43:27.655 --> 00:43:30.691
- Let's go. - How could you do that?

698
00:43:30.725 --> 00:43:34.495
Are you even a human being?

699
00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:49.110
That's his shirt.

700
00:43:51.612 --> 00:43:53.614
If you want to enjoy the rest of your life,

701
00:43:53.648 --> 00:43:55.049
don't let Mom leave you.

702
00:43:55.249 --> 00:43:56.517
That's the only way.

703
00:44:01.188 --> 00:44:02.690
Do you want to wash your face?

704
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:03.924
No, I don't.

705
00:44:05.726 --> 00:44:07.294
Did you hear what the doctor said?

706
00:44:07.294 --> 00:44:10.631
You're better now. You can go home at the end of the week.

707
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.269
Ru Ri. I'll stay here today.

708
00:44:15.269 --> 00:44:16.904
Go home and get some rest.

709
00:44:16.904 --> 00:44:19.440
No, Mom. I'll stay. You should go.

710
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.843
No, it's fine. You must be tired after coming a long way.

711
00:44:22.843 --> 00:44:24.245
You can't go there.

712
00:44:24.979 --> 00:44:26.047
I told you.

713
00:44:26.814 --> 00:44:29.383
I don't want to see neither of you ever again.

714
00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:32.520
Don't even think about moving into my house.

715
00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.522
Honey, please.

716
00:44:34.522 --> 00:44:37.324
Get out, you two. I don't want to see your faces.

717
00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:39.360
Get out.

718
00:44:42.963 --> 00:44:44.165
Fine.

719
00:44:44.632 --> 00:44:47.268
Then I'll come back early in the morning.

720
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:48.436
Let's go.

721
00:44:51.205 --> 00:44:53.441
- What's wrong? - What is it?

722
00:44:53.474 --> 00:44:56.210
My leg.

723
00:44:56.477 --> 00:44:57.545
What?

724
00:44:58.045 --> 00:44:59.380
- Leg? - What about your leg?

725
00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.481
What about your leg?

726
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:01.749
Why does your leg hurt?

727
00:45:02.583 --> 00:45:03.751
Do you want me to call the nurse?

728
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:05.686
- Yes. - Don't go.

729
00:45:05.786 --> 00:45:07.555
Don't go. Don't.

730
00:45:07.555 --> 00:45:08.589
What?

731
00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:11.225
- Cramp. - Cramp?

732
00:45:11.225 --> 00:45:13.694
- Cramp. - You have a cramp?

733
00:45:13.694 --> 00:45:15.096
Where?

734
00:45:15.129 --> 00:45:17.264
- Here? - Yes. There.

735
00:45:17.264 --> 00:45:18.733
Do you feel better now, Dad?

736
00:45:18.733 --> 00:45:20.935
Little bit more.

737
00:45:22.536 --> 00:45:24.939
Good. It's good now.

738
00:45:26.073 --> 00:45:28.309
- I'm cold. - You're cold?

739
00:45:28.442 --> 00:45:30.244
Is there a problem with the blood circulation?

740
00:45:30.244 --> 00:45:31.979
I'll go get more blankets.

741
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:33.147
Okay.

742
00:45:33.214 --> 00:45:34.648
It's cold.

743
00:45:34.982 --> 00:45:36.584
Let me see.

744
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.185
It's cold.

745
00:45:38.519 --> 00:45:40.588
You'll feel better soon. Hang in there.

746
00:45:40.588 --> 00:45:42.356
It's cold.

747
00:45:42.623 --> 00:45:45.226
What should I do?

748
00:45:46.494 --> 00:45:47.895
Hold on.

749
00:45:49.396 --> 00:45:50.664
Hug me.

750
00:45:51.966 --> 00:45:52.933
What?

751
00:45:52.933 --> 00:45:56.270
Hug me. I'm cold.

752
00:46:00.608 --> 00:46:01.809
Come here.

753
00:46:04.745 --> 00:46:07.915
- How do you feel now? Better? - Yes.

754
00:46:19.059 --> 00:46:21.195
Hey, Young Hye.

755
00:46:22.463 --> 00:46:24.665
You're very lucky.

756
00:46:25.232 --> 00:46:28.536
I'll let it go just this once.

757
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:33.274
But you must repent for the rest of your life...

758
00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:35.976
beside me.

759
00:46:37.344 --> 00:46:38.712
Did you say repent?

760
00:46:39.613 --> 00:46:41.816
This all happened because of you.

761
00:46:41.816 --> 00:46:44.785
I collapsed because you stressed me out...

762
00:46:45.519 --> 00:46:49.590
with the marriage graduation.

763
00:46:50.357 --> 00:46:54.795
If you ever say that again,

764
00:46:54.795 --> 00:46:58.132
I'll just kill myself with a stroke.

765
00:46:58.132 --> 00:46:59.333
Let me go.

766
00:46:59.633 --> 00:47:01.836
Don't ever say that again.

767
00:47:02.169 --> 00:47:03.704
Let me go.

768
00:47:03.704 --> 00:47:04.839
Promise me.

769
00:47:04.839 --> 00:47:06.373
Let me go first.

770
00:47:06.373 --> 00:47:08.776
- Promise me first. - My gosh.

771
00:47:08.943 --> 00:47:10.544
Let me go.

772
00:47:10.544 --> 00:47:11.979
Promise me.

773
00:47:12.713 --> 00:47:14.014
Promise me.

774
00:47:14.148 --> 00:47:15.916
Mom. I got the blankets.

775
00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:19.687
Give them to me.

776
00:47:31.665 --> 00:47:32.800
Hey, Ru Ri.

777
00:47:33.834 --> 00:47:35.636
Go on your knees.

778
00:47:37.171 --> 00:47:38.172
Pardon?

779
00:47:38.606 --> 00:47:40.441
Go on your knees. Now.

780
00:47:40.441 --> 00:47:42.109
Okay.

781
00:47:50.584 --> 00:47:51.819
Speak after me.

782
00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.856
Please forgive me.

783
00:47:56.123 --> 00:47:57.725
From now on,

784
00:47:58.325 --> 00:48:01.195
I'll do as what Dad says.

785
00:48:02.062 --> 00:48:03.497
Dad.

786
00:48:03.564 --> 00:48:05.966
- Honey. - Aren't you going to say it?

787
00:48:11.105 --> 00:48:13.774
I know I've committed a grave sin.

788
00:48:14.808 --> 00:48:18.646
I'll do everything you tell me to do from now on.

789
00:48:18.812 --> 00:48:21.916
Your mother begged me to forgive her...

790
00:48:22.049 --> 00:48:24.919
and said that she'll never do that again.

791
00:48:25.152 --> 00:48:29.056
So I will forgive you this time.

792
00:48:32.526 --> 00:48:35.362
- Okay. - But keep this in mind.

793
00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.398
You can...

794
00:48:38.465 --> 00:48:43.170
never meet that scumbag again.

795
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.440
You can't call or text him.

796
00:48:47.474 --> 00:48:49.176
Can you promise me that?

797
00:48:51.312 --> 00:48:52.546
Why aren't you answering me?

798
00:48:53.614 --> 00:48:54.815
Promise me.

799
00:48:57.318 --> 00:48:58.319
Yes.

800
00:48:59.386 --> 00:49:01.422
I won't meet him again.

801
00:49:01.422 --> 00:49:02.656
I promise.

802
00:49:02.823 --> 00:49:03.857
All right.

803
00:49:05.726 --> 00:49:08.729
I recorded all of that.

804
00:49:09.897 --> 00:49:12.900
If you break that promise,

805
00:49:13.067 --> 00:49:16.103
it's the end for both of us.

806
00:49:16.837 --> 00:49:18.505
- Do you understand? - Yes.

807
00:49:20.107 --> 00:49:23.143
Today, your mom will watch over me,

808
00:49:24.111 --> 00:49:25.646
so you can go home now.

809
00:49:26.513 --> 00:49:27.715
Go now.

810
00:49:36.957 --> 00:49:40.094
Good night.

811
00:49:43.364 --> 00:49:45.232
Hey, Young Hye.

812
00:49:48.569 --> 00:49:49.603
What?

813
00:49:50.704 --> 00:49:52.840
Help me wash my face.

814
00:49:56.076 --> 00:49:57.611
Try this. Tell me how it tastes.

815
00:49:58.212 --> 00:49:59.546
Thank you.

816
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:11.859
I'm not lying here,

817
00:50:12.026 --> 00:50:14.461
but I think a cancer patient could rise up after eating this.

818
00:50:16.497 --> 00:50:18.065
If it's that good, it must be a success.

819
00:50:18.465 --> 00:50:19.566
A success?

820
00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:21.835
Gosh.

821
00:50:22.936 --> 00:50:25.105
Is he trying to charm me with his food?

822
00:50:25.706 --> 00:50:29.710
Then I must eat it in a sexy way.

823
00:50:32.813 --> 00:50:35.983
What kind of a success?

824
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:39.520
- Are you curious? - Of course.

825
00:50:42.189 --> 00:50:43.223
Here.

826
00:50:44.825 --> 00:50:48.729
"Recruiting people who can develop new menus for SC Food"?

827
00:50:49.863 --> 00:50:51.765
- What is this? - Just as what it says.

828
00:50:52.299 --> 00:50:54.168
I wanted to develop new menus.

829
00:50:54.168 --> 00:50:55.335
What?

830
00:50:56.036 --> 00:50:59.206
You wanted me to taste your food for a new menu?

831
00:50:59.706 --> 00:51:01.608
Gosh, I knew it.

832
00:51:01.608 --> 00:51:03.811
It's cold. Turn the air conditioner off.

833
00:51:04.144 --> 00:51:06.713
I will raise my clothes up to here, so that it can even cover my neck.

834
00:51:08.415 --> 00:51:09.483
By the way,

835
00:51:10.417 --> 00:51:13.587
how's Ru Ri?

836
00:51:14.855 --> 00:51:16.957
You should be honest with me.

837
00:51:17.224 --> 00:51:20.227
You're really interested in Ru Ri, right?

838
00:51:20.694 --> 00:51:22.296
You didn't know when she was here,

839
00:51:22.296 --> 00:51:24.465
but after she left, you feel empty, and you miss her.

840
00:51:24.465 --> 00:51:26.066
That's why you were looking at her picture.

841
00:51:26.066 --> 00:51:27.668
And that's why you brought me here to ask about her.

842
00:51:27.668 --> 00:51:29.503
I'm right. I'm right.

843
00:51:29.603 --> 00:51:31.705
You should have treated her nicely from the start.

844
00:51:31.705 --> 00:51:33.607
- She's a really nice girl. - Stop it.

845
00:51:33.607 --> 00:51:36.977
Gosh, that innocent girl was so hurt,

846
00:51:36.977 --> 00:51:38.645
I don't know if she'll accept you.

847
00:51:38.745 --> 00:51:41.048
And her dad is really scary.

848
00:51:41.315 --> 00:51:43.650
- That's... - When are you going to Korea?

849
00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:45.686
Why?

850
00:51:45.686 --> 00:51:47.855
To enter a contest like this, you must need an assistant.

851
00:51:48.288 --> 00:51:51.125
Where would you get someone who would know how to help you?

852
00:51:52.126 --> 00:51:55.129
Witty Lee Myung Rang would be by your side to help.

853
00:51:55.996 --> 00:51:57.131
Let's go!

854
00:52:20.187 --> 00:52:24.591
You can never meet that scumbag again.

855
00:52:44.111 --> 00:52:46.547
I'm texting you because I am worried.

856
00:52:47.648 --> 00:52:49.883
I want to know how it went with your father.

857
00:52:51.084 --> 00:52:53.086
I'm going to Seoul soon.

858
00:53:15.209 --> 00:53:18.145
You're really interested in Ru Ri, right?

859
00:53:18.946 --> 00:53:20.514
You didn't know when she was here,

860
00:53:20.514 --> 00:53:22.716
but after she left, you feel empty, and you miss her.

861
00:53:22.883 --> 00:53:25.152
You should have treated her nicely from the start.

862
00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:32.793
(Chief of Food Laboratory, Choi Sun Young)

863
00:53:33.994 --> 00:53:35.896
Chief of Food Laboratory, Choi Sun Young.

864
00:53:36.396 --> 00:53:38.265
What do you think? Do you like it?

865
00:53:38.865 --> 00:53:42.169
I thought Chairman Kevin would be here to greet me.

866
00:53:42.502 --> 00:53:43.937
He doesn't seem to be here.

867
00:53:44.071 --> 00:53:46.707
He's still in the US, but he's expecting a lot from you.

868
00:53:46.707 --> 00:53:48.675
In that case, he should have full trust in me.

869
00:53:49.376 --> 00:53:51.545
Why are we recruiting menu developers?

870
00:53:51.545 --> 00:53:52.879
It was his orders.

871
00:53:53.013 --> 00:53:56.817
He wanted us to be prepared in case we couldn't recruit Go Jung Do.

872
00:53:56.984 --> 00:54:00.320
When will Chairman Kevin come to Korea?

873
00:54:00.821 --> 00:54:03.090
I'd like to see him to talk to him myself.

874
00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:04.725
He'd be coming back after 47 years,

875
00:54:04.725 --> 00:54:06.994
so it would take a while for him to wrap up his things in the US.

876
00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:11.064
I will recruit Go Jung Do. Just buy me some time.

877
00:54:11.131 --> 00:54:12.899
I just follow his orders.

878
00:54:13.934 --> 00:54:16.670
The contest is next week. I'd like you to be the judge.

879
00:54:26.146 --> 00:54:29.116
Come to my office right now.

880
00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:38.058
Here you go.

881
00:54:38.458 --> 00:54:40.494
- Okay. - Okay.

882
00:54:40.894 --> 00:54:43.297
- Okay. - Okay.

883
00:54:45.799 --> 00:54:47.267
We won!

884
00:54:47.267 --> 00:54:49.670
Your arms may be muscular,

885
00:54:49.903 --> 00:54:51.271
but you are too slow.

886
00:54:51.271 --> 00:54:52.339
Oh, my.

887
00:54:53.206 --> 00:54:55.442
How dare you talk to me like that?

888
00:54:55.442 --> 00:54:57.044
How do you think it got muscular?

889
00:54:57.311 --> 00:55:00.747
It's because I used my knife so much so that I could feed you.

890
00:55:00.747 --> 00:55:02.115
Stop fighting.

891
00:55:02.149 --> 00:55:03.917
Why are you always saying bad things to my sister...

892
00:55:06.019 --> 00:55:07.454
I mean, my brother?

893
00:55:07.587 --> 00:55:09.089
Let's go, brother. Let's have ice cream.

894
00:55:09.189 --> 00:55:10.357
Okay, sister.

895
00:55:10.357 --> 00:55:11.625
There's nothing for you.

896
00:55:17.798 --> 00:55:18.999
Are you that happy?

897
00:55:20.267 --> 00:55:23.503
Eun Byul's smile got so much prettier after she met you.

898
00:55:24.304 --> 00:55:27.374
When she lived with me, she was angry all the time.

899
00:55:29.042 --> 00:55:30.243
Thank you.

900
00:55:30.811 --> 00:55:34.247
Not only for Eun Byul. You made me forget the wounds...

901
00:55:34.815 --> 00:55:36.416
I received from that woman.

902
00:55:38.785 --> 00:55:40.454
Will you really not tell me...

903
00:55:41.822 --> 00:55:43.323
about your mother?

904
00:55:47.194 --> 00:55:48.362
Do you really want to know?

905
00:55:55.335 --> 00:55:56.436
That woman...

906
00:55:58.004 --> 00:55:59.873
should not have become a mother.

907
00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:05.879
Whenever she met a new man, she left home.

908
00:56:06.546 --> 00:56:08.415
When it was over, she'd come back home again.

909
00:56:09.249 --> 00:56:10.684
This went on forever...

910
00:56:12.085 --> 00:56:14.588
until she took all of Dad's money...

911
00:56:14.588 --> 00:56:18.625
and fled to Japan with a man.

912
00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:20.560
Then...

913
00:56:22.229 --> 00:56:24.765
how did Eun Byul's parents' die?

914
00:56:29.002 --> 00:56:30.203
They were killed...

915
00:56:31.438 --> 00:56:33.006
by Choi Sun Young.

916
00:56:33.673 --> 00:56:36.276
What do you mean they were killed?

917
00:56:37.377 --> 00:56:38.378
My dad...

918
00:56:40.247 --> 00:56:44.084
was betrayed, but he still loved her.

919
00:56:44.751 --> 00:56:46.853
10 years ago, after he found out he had cancer,

920
00:56:47.587 --> 00:56:49.823
he wished to see her. So my brother and his wife...

921
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.459
went to Japan to find her.

922
00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:57.297
That's when it happened.

923
00:56:58.064 --> 00:57:02.002
They had persuaded her into going and were heading to the airport.

924
00:57:02.335 --> 00:57:03.904
But she must have made a big fuss,

925
00:57:04.104 --> 00:57:05.439
- saying she couldn't go. - Stop the car.

926
00:57:05.439 --> 00:57:07.541
- Stop the car. - My brother couldn't bear it,

927
00:57:07.707 --> 00:57:09.209
so they had a fight.

928
00:57:09.376 --> 00:57:10.944
Stop the car.

929
00:57:11.144 --> 00:57:12.379
Stop the car.

930
00:57:12.379 --> 00:57:14.815
You can just meet Father, and then you can leave.

931
00:57:14.815 --> 00:57:16.750
- Stop the car. - Gosh.

932
00:57:42.776 --> 00:57:44.377
Gosh.

933
00:57:44.377 --> 00:57:47.514
The car! It's going to explode!

934
00:57:48.248 --> 00:57:50.917
Honey, Yoo Jeong, wake up!

935
00:57:51.418 --> 00:57:52.519
She's unconscious.

936
00:57:52.519 --> 00:57:54.187
That's not what's important!

937
00:57:54.287 --> 00:57:56.623
Why did you force me to come? I told you I didn't want to go.

938
00:57:56.723 --> 00:57:57.858
Why?

939
00:57:58.024 --> 00:57:59.359
Wait, no.

940
00:57:59.359 --> 00:58:02.729
I... I need to get out.

941
00:58:02.729 --> 00:58:04.865
- It's dangerous. - Don't move.

942
00:58:04.898 --> 00:58:07.334
If you move and we fall, we'll die.

943
00:58:07.334 --> 00:58:10.604
I won't die. Why should I? I'm going to get out.

944
00:58:10.704 --> 00:58:13.540
Open the door. Open the door now.

945
00:58:13.607 --> 00:58:15.175
Open the door.

946
00:58:20.413 --> 00:58:23.183
Mom, please. Stay still.

947
00:58:23.183 --> 00:58:26.319
Rescue will be here soon. Stay still until then.

948
00:58:27.187 --> 00:58:30.056
Mom. You must not leave.

949
00:58:30.056 --> 00:58:34.127
My daughter Eun Byul can't even walk yet.

950
00:58:34.127 --> 00:58:35.629
She's only a baby.

951
00:58:43.303 --> 00:58:45.572
Please.

952
00:58:45.572 --> 00:58:49.209
People have their own destiny.

953
00:58:49.976 --> 00:58:53.713
It's your fate to have me for your mom,

954
00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:57.918
and it's your daughter's fate to live without her parents,

955
00:58:57.918 --> 00:58:59.019
so...

956
00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.354
don't blame me!

957
00:59:01.354 --> 00:59:04.424
Mom. Mom.

958
00:59:04.724 --> 00:59:06.459
Mom.

959
00:59:17.938 --> 00:59:20.040
Do you know what my brother's last word was?

960
00:59:20.106 --> 00:59:21.207
He told me...

961
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:24.978
to never forgive her.

962
00:59:30.016 --> 00:59:31.818
A woman can do anything...

963
00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:34.955
if she can kill her own child.

964
00:59:36.856 --> 00:59:39.793
That's why she's scary.

965
00:59:48.935 --> 00:59:53.607
Jung Do. You'll soon come to me.

966
00:59:54.374 --> 00:59:57.377
I'll make you so.
