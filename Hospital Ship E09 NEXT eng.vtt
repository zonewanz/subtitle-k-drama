1
00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.606
Is it a haunted ship?

2
00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:17.306
It's worse than a ship of pirates.

3
00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:18.606
What are you doing?

4
00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:20.136
"If you can't avoid it, enjoy it."

5
00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:21.177
Take a look.

6
00:00:21.177 --> 00:00:23.336
- What do you think of my daughter? - Impressive.

7
00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:25.546
It's pie in the sky.

8
00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.206
Why would they come...

9
00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:28.737
- Clear. - work here?

10
00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:33.737
Did I miss something during such a simple operation?

11
00:00:33.937 --> 00:00:35.377
What have you done?

12
00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:37.537
All I did was tell the truth to the guardian.

13
00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.876
Get out, you punk!

14
00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:41.037
I'll be working here from now on.

15
00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:43.077
I'm Song Eun Jae, a surgeon.

16
00:00:46.507 --> 00:00:48.107
I'm sorry, Mom.

17
00:00:57.577 --> 00:00:59.207
(Episode 9)

18
00:02:08.176 --> 00:02:09.506
You're up early.

19
00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:11.837
You treated many patients. Aren't you tired?

20
00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:14.937
- Not really. - Are you going to work out?

21
00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:18.247
You don't skip a day, do you?

22
00:02:18.247 --> 00:02:20.307
You've been practicing for days.

23
00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:22.876
Is it going well?

24
00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:26.506
I'm begging my hand...

25
00:02:27.536 --> 00:02:29.707
to get used to it.

26
00:02:29.707 --> 00:02:32.876
"Don't let the head or the heart stop you."

27
00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:36.506
Please remember it.

28
00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:40.337
In reality,

29
00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:42.247
it's all about muscle memory.

30
00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:43.707
Bingo.

31
00:02:46.247 --> 00:02:49.277
You should continue. I'll get going.

32
00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:48.277
Let's take a look.

33
00:03:48.277 --> 00:03:50.406
- My goodness. - Hey.

34
00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:52.576
Don't run. Be careful.

35
00:03:52.576 --> 00:03:54.076
Ms. Lee Ye Rim.

36
00:03:54.076 --> 00:03:55.807
- Yes? - How long has it been?

37
00:03:55.807 --> 00:03:57.636
My lower back has been hurting for days.

38
00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.207
- Mr. Chu. - I need an operation now.

39
00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:02.506
I'm sorry. I can't do anything because of my child.

40
00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:03.876
- Mr. Yoo Sung Cheol? - Take care of it.

41
00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.636
- He's not here yet. - Please wait.

42
00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:07.976
- Mr. Kim? - Be careful.

43
00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:10.677
- Nurse Yoo. - Please wait a while.

44
00:04:10.677 --> 00:04:12.576
- Please hurry up. - Yes, sir.

45
00:04:12.576 --> 00:04:14.307
We'll prepare your medicine.

46
00:04:14.307 --> 00:04:16.036
- Thank you. - I will.

47
00:04:16.036 --> 00:04:17.777
Hey, can you stay still?

48
00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:18.976
There are so many people.

49
00:04:18.976 --> 00:04:21.237
- I'm sorry, sir. - Goodness.

50
00:04:21.237 --> 00:04:23.677
- Please hurry. I'm in so much pain. - Goodness.

51
00:04:23.677 --> 00:04:25.307
There are so many patients.

52
00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:29.477
Suction.

53
00:04:30.407 --> 00:04:31.636
Suction.

54
00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:35.907
Suction.

55
00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:39.836
- Gosh. - Goodness, I'm sorry.

56
00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:42.776
It looks fine.

57
00:04:46.737 --> 00:04:48.807
You're too handsome...

58
00:04:48.807 --> 00:04:50.336
to stay on the island.

59
00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:52.576
- Let's treat with acupuncture. - Yes, doctor.

60
00:04:56.506 --> 00:04:57.607
Doctor.

61
00:04:58.376 --> 00:05:00.376
When do you finish work?

62
00:05:04.677 --> 00:05:07.547
You're tough just like my ideal...

63
00:05:09.407 --> 00:05:10.607
You're my...

64
00:05:12.237 --> 00:05:13.836
- Mr. Park Jang Pyeong. - Yes.

65
00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:16.937
- Mr. Park. - I'm coming.

66
00:05:19.107 --> 00:05:21.737
- Hello. - Please come in.

67
00:05:30.477 --> 00:05:34.506
(Prescribed medicine)

68
00:05:36.706 --> 00:05:38.477
Ms. Lee Sung Joo.

69
00:05:38.477 --> 00:05:41.336
Mr. Park Jang Pyeong. Ms. Kim Byung Hwa.

70
00:05:41.336 --> 00:05:43.006
Are you Ms. Lee Sung Joo?

71
00:05:43.136 --> 00:05:45.206
Here you go, Mr. Park.

72
00:05:45.276 --> 00:05:46.977
- Here you go. - Thank you.

73
00:05:48.177 --> 00:05:50.576
Why did you come out? You have many patients to see.

74
00:05:50.576 --> 00:05:52.206
That's why.

75
00:05:52.907 --> 00:05:54.607
Have you seen Nurse Yoo?

76
00:05:55.107 --> 00:05:56.907
There's so much work to do.

77
00:05:57.076 --> 00:05:59.506
She was heading to the operation room.

78
00:05:59.907 --> 00:06:01.977
- Again? - What do you mean?

79
00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.506
She's lost her mind after assisting the liver transplant.

80
00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:05.537
She goes to the operation room whenever she can.

81
00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:36.206
What's the matter?

82
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.977
What are you doing here?

83
00:07:39.477 --> 00:07:41.376
We have visitors on top of residents.

84
00:07:41.376 --> 00:07:43.276
Isn't it extremely busy at Internal Medicine?

85
00:07:43.937 --> 00:07:45.336
Of course, it is.

86
00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:49.506
Including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and acute pancreatitis...

87
00:07:50.576 --> 00:07:53.206
We have two patients waiting for fluid injection.

88
00:07:55.136 --> 00:07:56.836
Can't I work with surgeons?

89
00:07:56.836 --> 00:07:58.836
You can work with him instead.

90
00:07:58.836 --> 00:08:02.206
That's sad to hear. Do you hate me that much?

91
00:08:02.307 --> 00:08:05.307
It's just that my dream is to be a scrub nurse.

92
00:08:05.307 --> 00:08:06.506
(Scrub nurse handles sterile equipment during operations.)

93
00:08:06.506 --> 00:08:10.206
- Switch with me, please? - No way.

94
00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:12.807
All operations on the hospital ship are urgent.

95
00:08:12.807 --> 00:08:15.477
- They require experience. - Please, Nurse Pyo.

96
00:08:15.477 --> 00:08:18.336
It's impossible. Even if I want to,

97
00:08:18.336 --> 00:08:20.636
there's no way that Dr. Song will approve it.

98
00:08:20.907 --> 00:08:22.506
Why do you think so?

99
00:08:23.307 --> 00:08:24.576
Doctor.

100
00:08:25.177 --> 00:08:26.506
Will you allow it?

101
00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:29.136
Under one condition.

102
00:08:34.376 --> 00:08:35.506
(Surgery Guidelines)

103
00:08:37.907 --> 00:08:40.106
I'll test you once every two days.

104
00:08:40.507 --> 00:08:43.407
If you pass, we start with a simple operation.

105
00:08:44.777 --> 00:08:48.106
Will you teach Nurse Yoo?

106
00:08:48.106 --> 00:08:50.647
- Yes. - Will you also test her?

107
00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:53.307
Yes, is there something wrong?

108
00:08:53.836 --> 00:08:56.677
No, not necessarily.

109
00:08:57.076 --> 00:08:59.476
Get back to work before I change my mind.

110
00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:01.807
You must finish what you started without a flaw.

111
00:09:02.206 --> 00:09:04.206
Yes, doctor.

112
00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.836
Thank you so much.

113
00:09:08.736 --> 00:09:11.236
- Let's wrap up our work. - Okay.

114
00:09:13.537 --> 00:09:18.007
Is it only me who thinks that Dr. Song has gotten...

115
00:09:18.007 --> 00:09:19.606
more softhearted?

116
00:09:20.507 --> 00:09:21.777
No way.

117
00:09:31.476 --> 00:09:33.277
Work is over.

118
00:09:45.147 --> 00:09:49.287
Internal Medicine had the most patients. Aren't you tired?

119
00:09:50.216 --> 00:09:51.246
Not at all.

120
00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:53.187
She's so full of energy.

121
00:09:55.086 --> 00:09:57.647
You people all did so well today.

122
00:09:58.316 --> 00:10:01.216
You're all completely out of it.

123
00:10:01.216 --> 00:10:03.787
I think this was the busiest day...

124
00:10:03.787 --> 00:10:06.517
since this ship started serving the islands.

125
00:10:06.517 --> 00:10:09.287
Good for you. You must be pleased.

126
00:10:11.346 --> 00:10:15.187
That's why I prepared a special event for you.

127
00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:16.647
An event?

128
00:10:18.647 --> 00:10:20.816
Set it up, and get the party poppers.

129
00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:22.147
They're coming.

130
00:10:22.147 --> 00:10:24.856
- Why must we come up here? - For a special event.

131
00:10:24.856 --> 00:10:27.446
I'm so tired. An event?

132
00:10:27.687 --> 00:10:29.287
Gosh. Oh, my.

133
00:10:31.387 --> 00:10:34.647
This beautiful island and its view deserve...

134
00:10:34.787 --> 00:10:36.887
an on-board barbecue.

135
00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:38.047
A female pig.

136
00:10:40.387 --> 00:10:43.086
- A female pig. - Stand in line.

137
00:10:43.387 --> 00:10:45.816
We have everything set up.

138
00:10:45.816 --> 00:10:47.417
- Come, and eat. - Let's eat.

139
00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:49.446
- This is great. - You're awesome.

140
00:10:49.446 --> 00:10:51.716
This is amazing. Thank you all.

141
00:10:51.716 --> 00:10:54.047
- Come, and eat. - Doctors! Doctors!

142
00:10:54.047 --> 00:10:55.716
- Let's eat. - Doctors!

143
00:10:55.716 --> 00:10:57.346
Come on out here!

144
00:10:57.346 --> 00:11:00.716
Something's broken. Something's badly broken.

145
00:11:00.757 --> 00:11:02.687
- It's a fracture. - Emergency kit.

146
00:11:02.687 --> 00:11:03.787
Yes, doctor.

147
00:11:05.616 --> 00:11:08.017
He's over here.

148
00:11:08.486 --> 00:11:10.287
- What's your name? - Wait, wait.

149
00:11:10.316 --> 00:11:11.687
I'm... I'm...

150
00:11:11.687 --> 00:11:13.116
Why's the bleeding so bad?

151
00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:16.216
- Which leg did you break? - No...

152
00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:19.346
It's not his leg.

153
00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:24.716
Doctor Song's here.

154
00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.446
Come on in.

155
00:11:28.986 --> 00:11:30.187
Have a seat.

156
00:11:31.187 --> 00:11:33.616
It's not his leg.

157
00:11:34.616 --> 00:11:36.147
It's...

158
00:11:37.716 --> 00:11:39.086
It's that thing.

159
00:11:45.757 --> 00:11:47.956
Will he be okay?

160
00:11:48.346 --> 00:11:49.486
Doctor, the kit...

161
00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:54.147
You're...

162
00:12:04.887 --> 00:12:05.917
You?

163
00:12:06.316 --> 00:12:09.417
How could you do this to me?

164
00:12:12.986 --> 00:12:14.086
My boyfriend.

165
00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:21.647
Come over here.

166
00:12:22.787 --> 00:12:24.086
Is this right?

167
00:12:24.086 --> 00:12:26.316
Nurse Yoo's boyfriend...

168
00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:29.887
cheated on her with her friend? Is that it?

169
00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:32.616
And he got into that mess while doing the deed?

170
00:12:33.446 --> 00:12:34.586
I think so.

171
00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:38.856
It must be the end of the world.

172
00:12:46.246 --> 00:12:47.246
Is it...

173
00:12:47.986 --> 00:12:49.187
badly broken?

174
00:12:49.986 --> 00:12:51.616
It's torn, to be exact.

175
00:12:52.586 --> 00:12:54.316
A penis doesn't have a bone.

176
00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:01.816
The exact diagnosis is a ruptured sclera.

177
00:13:01.816 --> 00:13:04.246
(Often mistaken for a fracture)

178
00:13:16.187 --> 00:13:19.017
- Did you see it yourself? - Yes.

179
00:13:19.346 --> 00:13:21.187
How swollen was it?

180
00:13:21.187 --> 00:13:22.816
It was this big.

181
00:13:24.047 --> 00:13:25.917
Was it that big?

182
00:13:26.547 --> 00:13:27.986
Is that possible?

183
00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:31.816
He saw it himself. Why ask me if... Quiet.

184
00:13:34.216 --> 00:13:35.446
She isn't a woman.

185
00:13:36.147 --> 00:13:37.316
Do you want some?

186
00:13:39.917 --> 00:13:41.486
No woman could do that.

187
00:13:42.316 --> 00:13:43.956
She wasn't shaken one bit.

188
00:13:44.316 --> 00:13:46.687
Is she a man? Artificial Intelligence?

189
00:13:48.147 --> 00:13:49.187
You idiot.

190
00:13:53.986 --> 00:13:56.486
Ah Rim, hear me out.

191
00:13:57.316 --> 00:13:59.446
I swear that I said no.

192
00:13:59.446 --> 00:14:03.387
- He forced me to... - You'd better... Shut that mouth.

193
00:14:04.346 --> 00:14:05.486
Come here.

194
00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:17.887
Open the door. Open up.

195
00:14:17.887 --> 00:14:21.687
I'll get my hands on you. Open this door! Open up!

196
00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:25.346
Don't kill me, Ah Rim. I did nothing wrong.

197
00:14:25.757 --> 00:14:27.387
It was all him.

198
00:14:27.387 --> 00:14:29.687
I said open this door! Hey!

199
00:14:30.446 --> 00:14:32.086
I'm really sorry.

200
00:14:32.086 --> 00:14:33.986
Open up right now.

201
00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:36.187
I'm really sorry.

202
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:38.417
Will you stop it?

203
00:14:38.417 --> 00:14:41.047
Leave her alone. Go back inside.

204
00:14:41.187 --> 00:14:42.816
You witch. You witch!

205
00:14:50.986 --> 00:14:52.417
Oh dear.

206
00:14:53.887 --> 00:14:54.956
Who's she?

207
00:14:55.486 --> 00:14:56.856
Secretary Hong? Why...

208
00:14:58.687 --> 00:15:00.216
- Are you... - Don't tell your father.

209
00:15:00.586 --> 00:15:04.787
Please don't tell Director Kim.

210
00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:06.586
Do you know each other?

211
00:15:07.517 --> 00:15:08.547
"Secretary"?

212
00:15:09.446 --> 00:15:10.517
"Father"?

213
00:15:11.187 --> 00:15:12.387
- Wait. - Hold on.

214
00:15:13.787 --> 00:15:16.316
If his father's a director, is he...

215
00:15:19.417 --> 00:15:22.616
Jae Geol's dad is the director of Geoje Jeil Hospital?

216
00:15:30.856 --> 00:15:34.387
What a huge bombshell.

217
00:15:34.616 --> 00:15:37.116
Yes. The sooner, the better.

218
00:15:37.216 --> 00:15:40.216
30 minutes? Yes, please.

219
00:15:40.616 --> 00:15:43.216
- Oh dear. - The son of Korea's Schweitzer...

220
00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:44.757
and the son of a director...

221
00:15:45.346 --> 00:15:48.287
The hospital ship's full of entitled, young men.

222
00:15:48.287 --> 00:15:49.687
It is.

223
00:15:50.147 --> 00:15:51.716
What are you talking about?

224
00:15:52.147 --> 00:15:53.616
Doctor Kim Jae Geol.

225
00:15:54.047 --> 00:15:56.956
His dad's the director of Geoje Jeil Hospital.

226
00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:57.956
What?

227
00:15:59.716 --> 00:16:02.346
What's going on in surgery?

228
00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:05.986
- Why not just chop it off? - Will you be quiet?

229
00:16:06.547 --> 00:16:08.147
The patient can hear you.

230
00:16:13.446 --> 00:16:14.486
Surgery?

231
00:16:15.017 --> 00:16:16.047
Yes.

232
00:16:16.047 --> 00:16:18.687
Here, on board the ship?

233
00:16:19.116 --> 00:16:20.187
Yes.

234
00:16:20.417 --> 00:16:21.486
No way.

235
00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:23.486
Forget it.

236
00:16:23.647 --> 00:16:25.856
I'll go to a general hospital.

237
00:16:26.187 --> 00:16:28.716
Get me a helicopter or the Coast Guard.

238
00:16:30.647 --> 00:16:33.956
- They'll come in 30 minutes. - You can do as you wish, but...

239
00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:36.446
But?

240
00:16:37.116 --> 00:16:38.517
If a ruptured sclera...

241
00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:42.086
isn't treated within two hours of the occurrence,

242
00:16:42.246 --> 00:16:45.647
you could suffer grave performance issues in the future.

243
00:16:49.887 --> 00:16:51.586
Grave performance issues?

244
00:16:52.757 --> 00:16:53.917
Don't you get it?

245
00:16:57.387 --> 00:16:59.316
Are you going to leave it?

246
00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:25.087
I'd always thought he looked pretty rich.

247
00:17:25.087 --> 00:17:26.286
Me too.

248
00:17:26.986 --> 00:17:28.046
Hey.

249
00:17:28.786 --> 00:17:30.486
Why are you out here?

250
00:17:30.546 --> 00:17:33.516
Why are you hiding like you're in the wrong?

251
00:17:34.617 --> 00:17:37.246
I'm not out here hiding.

252
00:17:37.647 --> 00:17:41.117
Doctor Song's too charitable for her own good.

253
00:17:41.617 --> 00:17:44.387
She should've lopped it off for you.

254
00:17:44.986 --> 00:17:46.446
What's the surgery for?

255
00:17:47.857 --> 00:17:50.187
He's going to get surgery?

256
00:17:50.387 --> 00:17:51.817
Didn't you know?

257
00:17:52.317 --> 00:17:53.317
Darn it.

258
00:17:54.417 --> 00:17:56.956
What is going on?

259
00:17:56.956 --> 00:17:59.117
This is a disaster.

260
00:17:59.117 --> 00:18:00.246
It is.

261
00:18:11.687 --> 00:18:12.986
It's a simple surgery.

262
00:18:13.687 --> 00:18:15.817
We'll get the blood clot and sew you up.

263
00:18:16.617 --> 00:18:19.857
The rupture can cause a change in shape.

264
00:18:23.046 --> 00:18:25.647
Are you sure I'll have no performance issues?

265
00:18:30.687 --> 00:18:33.147
He looks nervous. I'll add some sedatives.

266
00:18:33.486 --> 00:18:34.486
Sure.

267
00:18:51.617 --> 00:18:54.317
Why are you operating on someone like him?

268
00:18:57.857 --> 00:19:00.817
- Nurse Yoo. - Don't. He doesn't deserve it.

269
00:19:01.446 --> 00:19:03.446
Do you know what you're saying?

270
00:19:03.887 --> 00:19:06.446
He doesn't know what trust or love is.

271
00:19:07.857 --> 00:19:09.716
He doesn't deserve to have a male's organ.

272
00:19:09.716 --> 00:19:11.647
- So... - Stop it.

273
00:19:13.216 --> 00:19:15.317
Joon Young, get her out of here.

274
00:19:17.087 --> 00:19:19.246
No. She can scrub in.

275
00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.887
Scrub in, and help out.

276
00:19:26.187 --> 00:19:28.986
- Doctor. - Don't be a spiteful woman.

277
00:19:29.546 --> 00:19:33.486
Be the professional nurse you are, and help treat the patient.

278
00:19:34.917 --> 00:19:36.786
- Doctor. - Do it.

279
00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:45.286
I can't do that. I refuse!

280
00:19:46.046 --> 00:19:48.817
If you refuse, you are no longer...

281
00:19:48.817 --> 00:19:51.286
permitted into the operating room ever again.

282
00:19:53.456 --> 00:19:54.917
Do you still refuse?

283
00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:09.587

You're too good a surgeon. That's the problem.

295

That jerk won't lose his ability...

to be a man.

297

Hello.

- Hello. - Hello.

306
00:24:37.286 --> 00:24:39.847
Hi. Let's go.

307
00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:50.746
Who does that in this day and age?

308
00:24:51.286 --> 00:24:53.516
People would think they were filming a drama.

309
00:24:54.486 --> 00:24:56.286
We aren't very well.

310
00:24:57.387 --> 00:25:00.417
It's like the fox is acting like the king after the tiger left.

311
00:25:01.046 --> 00:25:03.246
Dr. Myung Se Joon became an assistant professor.

312
00:25:11.246 --> 00:25:13.087
Stay focused, will you?

313
00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:17.946
Look who's talking.

314
00:25:22.117 --> 00:25:24.617
Dr. Song Eun Jae may be emotionless,

315
00:25:24.946 --> 00:25:27.046
but she's still better, isn't she?

316
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:33.046
Everyone misses you.

317
00:25:37.187 --> 00:25:39.817
Doctor. When will you be back?

318
00:25:50.187 --> 00:25:53.317
Let's see. Dr. Song Eun Jae...

319
00:25:54.216 --> 00:25:55.387
There she is.

320
00:25:58.786 --> 00:26:01.647
What is all of that? That stack...

321
00:26:01.647 --> 00:26:04.587
Sort of like a lifeline?

322
00:26:04.587 --> 00:26:05.647
A lifeline?

323
00:26:05.647 --> 00:26:07.986
She's upset enough about being banished,

324
00:26:07.986 --> 00:26:10.286
but her classmate became an assistant professor.

325
00:26:10.486 --> 00:26:13.986
I'm sure she wants to find a huge case that will take down...

326
00:26:13.986 --> 00:26:16.587
that classmate and the professor.

327
00:26:16.587 --> 00:26:19.087
That's the only way she can go back.

328
00:26:20.516 --> 00:26:21.716
- Go in. - Okay.

329
00:26:25.087 --> 00:26:26.847
What will happen now?

330
00:26:26.847 --> 00:26:29.246
Will you continue working at the hospital?

331
00:26:30.016 --> 00:26:32.687
No. I should return.

332
00:26:33.556 --> 00:26:36.687
I will definitely return to the place...

333
00:26:37.587 --> 00:26:39.317
I came from.

334
00:26:40.357 --> 00:26:41.917
Because I'm confident.

335
00:26:42.417 --> 00:26:44.887
Confident that I can get myself back...

336
00:26:46.317 --> 00:26:48.286
purely on my skills, without exposing...

337
00:26:49.046 --> 00:26:50.387
other people's weaknesses.

338
00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:56.847
Because I'm going to go back.

339
00:27:11.216 --> 00:27:12.357
Dr. Kwak.

340
00:27:14.516 --> 00:27:15.946
What brings you here?

341
00:27:17.087 --> 00:27:19.516
Does someone need urgent care?

342
00:27:19.687 --> 00:27:20.847
No.

343
00:27:21.887 --> 00:27:24.246
I volunteered at the ER.

344
00:27:24.647 --> 00:27:27.216
They approved right away, saying they were short-staffed.

345
00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:28.986
Volunteer? Why?

346
00:27:28.986 --> 00:27:31.986
I felt like playing with a model wouldn't get me anywhere.

347
00:27:36.817 --> 00:27:37.986
That day...

348
00:27:39.617 --> 00:27:41.456
when Ms. Park Oh Weol collapsed,

349
00:27:43.286 --> 00:27:45.387
if you weren't there,

350
00:27:45.387 --> 00:27:47.687
she would've passed away right then and there.

351
00:27:49.317 --> 00:27:51.357
I don't want to be a doctor like that.

352
00:27:52.286 --> 00:27:54.887
- I'd rather... - You'd rather what?

353
00:27:58.117 --> 00:28:00.216
Would you quit medicine?

354
00:28:03.786 --> 00:28:05.786
I didn't think you were so rash.

355
00:28:06.286 --> 00:28:07.516
A doctor...

356
00:28:08.456 --> 00:28:10.387
grows through failure,

357
00:28:12.147 --> 00:28:14.456
although it is cruel that people are the subjects...

358
00:28:15.946 --> 00:28:17.486
of those failures.

359
00:28:20.556 --> 00:28:23.516
How many patients do you think died by these hands?

360
00:28:26.417 --> 00:28:28.556
Probably many more than by yours, right?

361
00:28:29.286 --> 00:28:30.516
Are you comforting me?

362
00:28:32.817 --> 00:28:34.046
I'm warning you.

363
00:28:41.917 --> 00:28:43.246
Dr. Song.

364
00:28:43.246 --> 00:28:44.847
An angina patient is coming in.

365
00:28:44.847 --> 00:28:48.216
I'm going to ask Internal Medicine for assistance. Go now.

366
00:29:04.687 --> 00:29:06.456
- Sir. - Hyun.

367
00:29:07.786 --> 00:29:10.357
I... I can't breathe...

368
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.009
(Episode 10 will air shortly.)
