<i>[Episode 6]</i>

3
00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:14.828
Why did you bring all your
stuff with you?

4
00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:16.071
I'm going to go somewhere else.

5
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:18.214
I keep reading the lines that
I'm writing out loud

6
00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:19.848
so I'm being a nuisance
to my juniors.

7
00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:21.653
Do you want to grab something to eat?

8
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.119
The food here is only 4,000 won?
How cheap.

9
00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:39.873
I was going to buy something cheaper
but I splurged a little.

10
00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.681
Come work at my house.

11
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:45.006
I'll be at work, so my house will be
empty until tonight.

12
00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:47.608
Did your mother leave?

13
00:00:47.608 --> 00:00:50.025
I was so taken aback since
she's so young and pretty.

14
00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:51.942
She looks like she's young
enough to be my older sister!

15
00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:53.714
The passcode
for my house is...

16
00:00:53.714 --> 00:00:55.530
I don't like being a burden
to others.

17
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.244
You can repay me then.

18
00:00:58.454 --> 00:00:59.601
With what?

19
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.287
Um... be my taste tester.

20
00:01:01.287 --> 00:01:03.043
What kinds of dishes do you like?

21
00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:07.102
Soups.

22
00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:11.581
Whoa!

23
00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:17.768
Wow!
What a refreshing taste!

24
00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.361
Clams are good for people
who use their brains a lot.

25
00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:26.465
Yum!

26
00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:28.379
This is good, too.

27
00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:30.640
Not as good as my mom used
to make when I was younger, though.

28
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.637
I mean, it's probably because there's
a story behind my mom's cooking

29
00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.723
that I remember it
being more delicious.

30
00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:41.055
So food tastes better to you
when there's a story behind it?

31
00:01:41.055 --> 00:01:42.055
Yes.

32
00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:44.327
So when you open your own restaurant

33
00:01:44.327 --> 00:01:47.194
be sure to include an item on your
menu that has a story behind it.

34
00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:48.424
It'll be a huge hit.

35
00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:58.479
Have I sufficiently repaid you
for the meal you made me?

36
00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.852
Yes.

37
00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:05.116
Will this omurice make it onto
your restaurant's menu, Chef?

38
00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:06.123
Nope.

39
00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:07.459
Sheesh.

40
00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.281
Thank you for the meal!

41
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.772
You're wearing your
sweater inside out.

42
00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:17.408
I was going to tell
you earlier

43
00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:19.355
but I thought you'd be
embarrassed, so I didn't.

44
00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.193
I wore it inside-out
on purpose, though.

45
00:02:21.193 --> 00:02:22.571
Why?

46
00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:24.155
The stitches were irritating me.

47
00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:27.428
I should've told you earlier, then!
I don't know why I got so scared.

48
00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:28.899
Senior Joon Ha...

49
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.060
Oh, I have a senior from
college who is a PD at SBC.

50
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.914
And he says that I'm too blunt

51
00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:36.196
and that I'll be stoned
to death one of these days.

52
00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:38.843
Did you refrain from telling me because
you though I'd stone you to death?

53
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:42.346
Oh, how refreshing. I thought
I'd die if I kept it inside!

54
00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:46.702
I also thought that it might just
be your sense of style

55
00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:48.631
since you're always
wearing things inside out.

56
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:51.248
You should've just asked,
instead of waiting so long to ask.

57
00:02:51.248 --> 00:02:52.732
I know, right?

58
00:02:58.636 --> 00:02:59.933
But, um...

59
00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:02.998
why does it feel like...

60
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.765
you're not making soups to
experiment with new menu items

61
00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:09.459
but you're making them only because
I told you that I like soups?

62
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.858
Are your hunches
usually correct?

63
00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:15.559
No.

64
00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.367
Well, you're wrong
this time, too.

65
00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:23.559
I want to eat something spicy!

66
00:03:24.678 --> 00:03:26.118
Here.

67
00:03:33.693 --> 00:03:35.768
Ooh!
Oh, that's hot!

68
00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:49.120
Yum!

69
00:03:50.362 --> 00:03:51.445
Delicious.

70
00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:52.821
It's delicious.
It's delicious.

71
00:03:56.086 --> 00:03:58.458
I really like it.

72
00:03:58.458 --> 00:03:59.733
Want to clink glasses?

73
00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:19.653
- Is this how you seduce women?
- What do you mean?

74
00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:22.066
You're being too affectionate.

75
00:04:22.612 --> 00:04:24.567
I'm not affectionate.

76
00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:25.665
What is this, then?

77
00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.473
Are you being affectionate
because I'm not a woman to you?

78
00:04:27.473 --> 00:04:28.674
Do you want me to treat you like a woman?

79
00:04:29.754 --> 00:04:31.114
No.

80
00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:34.155
For me, work comes before love right now.

81
00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:40.463
Did you hear back from
Alain Passard?

82
00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:42.689
I sent him another email.

83
00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.244
You said it'll take about five years for
you to come back if you leave, right?

84
00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.266
How old will I be, then?

85
00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:50.312
I'll be 34.

86
00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.917
I could be married by then.

87
00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.581
If you tell me not to go,
then I won't go.

88
00:04:57.086 --> 00:04:59.343
Why would you stay for me?
I'm not that important.

89
00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:05.175
But we kissed.

90
00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:17.158
There's no reason to put meaning behind
a no-strings-attached kiss.

91
00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:21.982
We just got caught up in the
moment that day, after all.

92
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:25.708
I've decided to just
leave it at that.

93
00:05:27.364 --> 00:05:29.684
It was actually nice to
not take things too seriously

94
00:05:29.684 --> 00:05:31.927
for once in my life.

95
00:05:33.788 --> 00:05:35.607
Wow, you're so cool.

96
00:05:35.607 --> 00:05:37.396
I'm only acting that way.

97
00:05:39.912 --> 00:05:42.275
Because I'm older than you.

98
00:05:43.153 --> 00:05:47.309
I just feel like I should make sure
that we adhere to the guidelines.

99
00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:51.093
Your appeal is that you
don't put on an act, though.

100
00:05:51.093 --> 00:05:53.091
Your appeal just dropped.

101
00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:54.530
I'll just have to pick it up, then.

102
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.852
You're such a smooth talker.

103
00:05:56.852 --> 00:05:58.258
Is that what you like about me?

104
00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:00.008
Yeah.

105
00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:02.910
Of course you do.

106
00:06:04.102 --> 00:06:06.223
So you act cocky too, huh?

107
00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:16.145
<i>[Hong Ah]</i>

108
00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:17.400
It's Hong Ah.

109
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.730
Yeah.

110
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.251
<i>[Hong Ah]</i>

111
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.631
Aren't you going to pick it up?

112
00:06:28.408 --> 00:06:29.855
Pour me another shot.

113
00:07:09.174 --> 00:07:11.119
Hey, hey, hey.
She's here again.

114
00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:15.487
Wow, what a player. I guess you have
a way with both men and women, huh?

115
00:07:15.487 --> 00:07:18.115
She's really pretty, but
she's not really my type.

116
00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:20.312
What do you mean,
she's not your type?

117
00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:23.465
She's one-size-fits-all!
A goddess!

118
00:07:23.465 --> 00:07:24.578
Hey.

119
00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.155
Hey!

120
00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:30.300
You take inventory,
starting today.

121
00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:32.708
But that's your job, Sous Chef.

122
00:07:32.708 --> 00:07:35.266
The chef told you to be
my assistant.

123
00:07:35.266 --> 00:07:36.641
Have you forgotten?

124
00:07:38.446 --> 00:07:39.595
What, you don't want to?

125
00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:40.744
No.

126
00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:42.701
Hey, tell him which items
need restocking.

127
00:07:44.475 --> 00:07:45.651
Cauliflower and sea urchin.

128
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:47.949
Oh, we're out of salmon.
Caviar, too.

129
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:51.886
Tell me how much you need.

130

<i>[Kyung]</i>

132
00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:06.203
Yeah, Kyung?

133
00:08:06.203 --> 00:08:08.913
Um, Hyun Soo.

134
00:08:08.913 --> 00:08:12.045
Writer Park wants you to come back
starting tomorrow.

135
00:08:12.636 --> 00:08:14.254
I can't.

136
00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:17.172
You know how she fired me.

137
00:08:18.473 --> 00:08:19.617
<i>Give me the phone.</i>

138
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:22.126
<i>I'll give the phone to
Writer Park.</i>

139
00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:23.172
No.

140
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.578
Hey, Hyun Soo.

141
00:08:28.088 --> 00:08:29.550
Yes, Writer Park.

142
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.095
Do you have a grudge
against me?

143
00:08:32.107 --> 00:08:34.851
<i>People are all capable
of saying nasty things.</i>

144
00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:39.509
Just imagine how hard it was for me
to reach out to you!

145
00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:43.691
But, as you know,
Kyung is the type of girl

146
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:47.437
who doesn't even know
what an "episode" is!

147
00:08:47.437 --> 00:08:49.989
She's the one who does
all the grunt work!

148
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.961
Hyun Soo.

149
00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:54.445
Are you really going to refuse,
when I'm asking you like this?

150
00:08:54.445 --> 00:08:57.007
<i>I thought you liked and
respected me.</i>

151
00:08:57.595 --> 00:08:59.378
<i>Or was all of that a lie?</i>

152
00:08:59.912 --> 00:09:01.860
What were you up to
all this time?

153
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.807
I was preparing my script
for the open call.

154
00:09:03.807 --> 00:09:05.696
Show it to me.
I'll give you some feedback.

155
00:09:05.696 --> 00:09:07.901
Um, yes.
Thank you.

156
00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:09.039
Sure.

157
00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:11.360
- Do you want to eat?
- No.

158
00:09:25.685 --> 00:09:28.033
You can't even make
ramen properly?

159
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.037
This is porridge, not ramen!

160
00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:33.363
I just wanted you to be
able to digest it well.

161
00:09:33.363 --> 00:09:36.552
You've been having
digestive issues lately.

162
00:09:36.552 --> 00:09:38.986
But you still said that
you wanted ramen.

163
00:09:39.754 --> 00:09:43.486
Really? So you were being
considerate, huh?

164
00:09:43.486 --> 00:09:47.272
What to do, though, when I can't
eat this since it's so disgusting?

165
00:09:47.272 --> 00:09:48.432
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:49.938 --> 00:09:51.390
Ugh.

167
00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:54.970
This is why you'll never make it!

168
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.171
Because you worry about
stupid things like this!

169
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.864
Thank you.

170
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.865
Don't come in until I call you in.

171
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:18.412
Yes, Sir.

172
00:10:31.062 --> 00:10:32.878
You took a new family portrait.

173
00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:35.888
Looks like you get along.
It looks so peaceful.

174
00:10:35.888 --> 00:10:37.720
Why did you come here?

175
00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:40.759
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

176
00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:43.066
Why would I, when
things are over between us?

177
00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:44.504
How can they be? We have a child.

178
00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:46.946
Stop using the kid
for this kind of thing.

179
00:10:51.608 --> 00:10:52.739
Hey!

180
00:10:53.504 --> 00:10:56.012
What?
Are you going to hit me?

181
00:10:57.066 --> 00:11:01.071
Hit me, so I can reminisce on what
it was like when we lived together.

182
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.151
Leave.

183
00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:10.869
You think I'll leave just
because you tell me to?

184
00:11:10.869 --> 00:11:14.519
Do I still look like the Yoo Young Mi
you used to beat up?

185
00:11:16.961 --> 00:11:20.253
Why did you only hit me?
How come you don't hit this woman?

186
00:11:22.162 --> 00:11:23.697
How long will you continue
to act like this?

187
00:11:24.903 --> 00:11:26.469
Pick up my calls.

188
00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:29.364
Once my husband,
always my husband.

189
00:11:29.364 --> 00:11:31.008
Tell me your bank account number.

190
00:11:40.696 --> 00:11:42.690
You're not allowed
to be happy...

191
00:11:43.158 --> 00:11:45.464
until I'm happy.

192
00:11:57.662 --> 00:12:00.277
You stayed in one spot for so long.
That's not like you at all.

193
00:12:00.277 --> 00:12:01.964
You look like the type to flit around.

194
00:12:02.854 --> 00:12:04.719
I like staying home and reading.

195
00:12:04.719 --> 00:12:06.475
That's why I still write.

196
00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:09.749
Everyone thinks that I'm an extrovert
but I'm actually an introvert.

197
00:12:09.749 --> 00:12:10.821
- Oh my!
- Oh!

198
00:12:13.052 --> 00:12:14.748
Are... are you okay?

199
00:12:15.582 --> 00:12:16.805
What is your problem?

200
00:12:16.805 --> 00:12:19.283
You think my pretty face
is for you to look at and enjoy?

201
00:12:19.283 --> 00:12:22.297
What are you going on about?
You bumped into me!

202
00:12:22.757 --> 00:12:24.529
You may be pretty, but
you have a nasty attitude.

203
00:12:24.529 --> 00:12:26.831
What?
Nasty attitude?

204
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:28.383
This is sexual harassment!

205
00:12:28.383 --> 00:12:31.109
Do you know how uncomfortable
your look made me feel?

206
00:12:31.109 --> 00:12:33.826
Why are you speaking informally to me?
What, you think I can't get mad?

207
00:12:33.826 --> 00:12:35.300
What are you going to do, huh?

208
00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:37.366
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:37.366 --> 00:12:38.885
She's a little sensitive right now.

210
00:12:38.885 --> 00:12:41.385
Is it a crime to say that
she's pretty, when she is?

211
00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:44.239
It's not, but she said that
it's making her uncomfortable.

212
00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:46.724
But she went overboard too,
so please let it go.

213
00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:48.498
Why, you little...

214
00:12:48.498 --> 00:12:51.060
I work at that restaurant there.
Please come by sometime.

215
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.871
I'll serve you delicious food.

216
00:12:59.701 --> 00:13:01.553
Hey, what is your problem?

217
00:13:01.553 --> 00:13:03.310
Why are you picking fights
with random people passing by?

218
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:07.714
Do you know how dirty it makes me feel
when a guy looks at me like that?

219
00:13:07.714 --> 00:13:09.360
Even so, just take it.

220
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.062
Most people in the world just endure
the things that make them annoyed.

221
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:16.364
Take me home.

222
00:13:16.364 --> 00:13:18.171
I knew you'd say that,
so I already called a cab.

223
00:13:19.638 --> 00:13:20.688
Here it is.

224
00:13:25.681 --> 00:13:26.704
Get in.

225
00:13:48.171 --> 00:13:49.642
Ugh, I can't do this.

226
00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:52.796
Huh?
Where are you going?

227
00:13:53.893 --> 00:13:56.250
Hey, get me a cup of coffee.

228
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.364
Yes, Ma'am.

229
00:14:00.267 --> 00:14:03.634
I have something I need to
say to you, Writer Park.

230
00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:04.782
Say it here, then.

231
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.384
I'm sorry, but I can't be
your assistant writer.

232
00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:16.287
I'd already decided to focus and
work on my own script this year...

233
00:14:17.455 --> 00:14:20.476
so I can't focus on yours.

234
00:14:27.248 --> 00:14:30.613
You call this writing? Where do you
get off acting so high and mighty?

235
00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:36.763
I thought you'd write well, since you're
so good at analyzing other people's work.

236
00:14:36.763 --> 00:14:38.746
But, what is this?

237
00:14:38.746 --> 00:14:41.036
The characters, directions,
and their lines!

238
00:14:41.036 --> 00:14:43.767
You didn't write a single
one of those correctly!

239
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:48.091
Is it really that much of a mess?

240
00:14:48.091 --> 00:14:50.358
You think that the open call for
script submissions is a joke?

241
00:14:50.358 --> 00:14:53.683
You know that I judged the first round of
the competition last year for SBC, right?

242
00:14:53.683 --> 00:14:56.942
This wouldn't have passed
even the first round.

243
00:14:56.942 --> 00:15:01.345
Know your damn place
instead of acting high and mighty!

- Ugh, why is this so strong and sweet?

245
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.783
I put two packets in,
since you seemed tired.

246
00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:20.071
How is it that you can't
do anything right?

247
00:15:20.637 --> 00:15:23.177
Just do as I say! Why are you thinking?

248
00:15:30.283 --> 00:15:31.579
I'm quitting, too.

249
00:15:31.579 --> 00:15:32.866
What?

250
00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.241
I have my own thoughts
and feelings

251
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:37.784
but all you ever do is yell at me.
You're going to drive me crazy.

252
00:15:37.784 --> 00:15:41.983
I can't be of any help to you, anyway.
I can't do this anymore.

253
00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.303
Goodness!

254
00:15:44.053 --> 00:15:45.778
Oh, goodness!

255
00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:48.903
Hey, wait, you...

256
00:15:48.903 --> 00:15:50.211
Do you even have a place to go?

257
00:15:50.211 --> 00:15:51.863
I can just go to a student hostel.

258
00:15:56.561 --> 00:15:57.961
Ugh!

259
00:15:58.422 --> 00:16:03.382
This is why they say that you
shouldn't take in other people's kids!

260
00:16:03.382 --> 00:16:06.441
I fed you and gave you a place
to stay when you had nowhere to go!

261
00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:08.654
You sure did teach her well.

262
00:16:08.654 --> 00:16:13.240
I'm going to make sure that you two
never make it in this industry!

263
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.354
I do have that kind of power,
at least, you know!

264
00:16:17.145 --> 00:16:18.654
Ugh!

00:16:43.416 --> 00:16:45.018
Would you like to come in?

268
00:16:45.018 --> 00:16:46.926
Let's just chat here briefly.

269
00:16:49.212 --> 00:16:50.956
Why did your mother come back?

270
00:16:51.451 --> 00:16:53.082
What, is she not allowed to come back?

271
00:16:53.082 --> 00:16:54.911
I was uneasy when you came back.

272
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.282
Because I was afraid that
she'd follow you here.

273
00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.584
She came to see me,
and threw a fit today.

274
00:17:00.488 --> 00:17:02.608
Please, take your mother
and leave.

275
00:17:02.608 --> 00:17:04.831
Let's all live in peace, okay?

276
00:17:05.636 --> 00:17:07.397
What could I possibly do?

277
00:17:07.397 --> 00:17:08.742
She listens to you, at least.

278
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.623
Your mother is a crazy woman.

279
00:17:13.693 --> 00:17:15.529
And who was it
who made her that way?

280
00:17:15.529 --> 00:17:18.502
Everyone blames everyone else
for their problems.

281
00:17:18.502 --> 00:17:20.052
It's not like I did it for no reason.

282
00:17:20.052 --> 00:17:21.727
She kept provoking me!

283
00:17:21.727 --> 00:17:23.621
I was there.

284
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:25.551
I'm begging you.

285
00:17:32.971 --> 00:17:34.033
Miss!

286
00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:35.483
Oh, hello.

287
00:17:35.483 --> 00:17:38.223
I got a call from the real estate agent.
They're coming to see the house tomorrow.

288
00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:39.556
I think it'll be rented out soon.

289
00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.185
What do you mean?

290
00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:44.532
Your younger sister is putting
the house up for rent

291
00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:46.875
and asked me to give her back
her security deposit.

292
00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:48.167
What?

293
00:17:54.219 --> 00:17:55.596
You put the house up for rent?

294
00:17:55.596 --> 00:17:59.354
Yeah. How long were you
planning to mooch off me?

295
00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:01.619
What do you mean?

296
00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:03.409
I found a place to live on my own.

297
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:06.071
Half of the deposit is mine,
so I'm going to take it and go.

298
00:18:06.071 --> 00:18:07.696
So have a nice life.

You heard back from
Alain Passard, didn't you?

319
00:19:53.861 --> 00:19:54.923
Yeah.

320
00:19:55.698 --> 00:19:57.446
Wow, congratulations!

321
00:19:58.214 --> 00:19:59.756
Do you want to meet up now?

322
00:20:00.683 --> 00:20:01.927
I can't.

323
00:20:01.927 --> 00:20:03.401
But we live in the same neighborhood.

324
00:20:03.401 --> 00:20:04.786
I'll meet you in front of your place.

325
00:20:04.786 --> 00:20:06.293
Surely you can see me
for just a short while.

326
00:20:06.293 --> 00:20:07.974
I said no!

327
00:20:08.762 --> 00:20:10.657
Wow, way to act your age.

328
00:20:10.657 --> 00:20:12.506
You're being stubborn because
you're not getting your way.

329
00:20:13.938 --> 00:20:17.294
Sorry.
Get some sleep, then.

330
00:20:18.577 --> 00:20:20.279
Okay.
Congrats again.

<i>[Caviar purchase log]</i>

332
00:20:45.264 --> 00:20:47.840
Get over here. You were
doing inventory this week, weren't you?

333
00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.277
Yes.

334
00:20:51.129 --> 00:20:53.073
Explain to me
how this happened.

335
00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:58.455
This is weird.
I only ordered one pack.

336
00:20:58.455 --> 00:21:00.638
So why does it say that
there were two this week?

337
00:21:01.591 --> 00:21:02.609
Yes, why?

338
00:21:02.609 --> 00:21:04.681
Why are you asking me that,
when you ordered it?

339
00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:07.054
Did you do this because
I yelled at you a little?

340
00:21:08.714 --> 00:21:11.332
Are you implying that I stole
from the restaurant?

341
00:21:11.332 --> 00:21:13.120
Everything is pointing to you!

342
00:21:16.706 --> 00:21:21.008
I came to this place because
of my trust in you.

343
00:21:21.008 --> 00:21:23.000
But today, you've broken that trust.

344
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.456
- Are you saying you didn't do it?
- I didn't do it.

345
00:21:24.456 --> 00:21:25.560
Who was it, then?

346
00:21:27.905 --> 00:21:30.176
I really wanted to leave
this place on a good note.

347
00:21:31.736 --> 00:21:33.369
What do you mean by that?

348
00:21:33.369 --> 00:21:35.158
I'm quitting.

349
00:21:35.158 --> 00:21:38.325
How could you do this to me?
I treasured you so much!

350
00:21:39.262 --> 00:21:41.137
I am thankful to you for that.

351
00:21:41.137 --> 00:21:42.628
That's fine and all, but how will you
take responsibility for this?

352
00:21:42.628 --> 00:21:45.933
I guess the order I made was wrong,
so I'll compensate you.

353
00:21:45.933 --> 00:21:48.041
So it's true that you're from
a rich family, isn't it?

354
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:49.993
That's why you're such
an asshole!

355
00:21:49.993 --> 00:21:52.645
We'll only be able to meet
again at a later date

356
00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:55.335
if you don't stoop to character
assassination, don't you think?

357
00:22:04.868 --> 00:22:06.536
I need you to come with me somewhere.

358
00:22:32.416 --> 00:22:34.631
It seems that your ancestors
did a lot of work for the government.

359
00:22:35.812 --> 00:22:38.101
"My ancestors?"
How funny.

360
00:22:38.101 --> 00:22:40.683
My grandfather, and my dad.

361
00:22:40.683 --> 00:22:43.099
They're right above me
on our family tree.

362
00:22:43.706 --> 00:22:45.320
Am I doing this right?

363
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.734
Like this?

364
00:22:46.734 --> 00:22:48.253
There's no such thing
as the "right way."

365
00:22:48.253 --> 00:22:49.817
How do you do it,
Mr. Ohn Jung Seon?

366
00:22:49.817 --> 00:22:52.578
I do it a little differently,
since I learned to do it differently.

367
00:23:05.532 --> 00:23:08.051
I heard that you quit
your job at the restaurant

368
00:23:08.051 --> 00:23:10.232
and figured that this was my chance.

369
00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:18.928
Can you give me
anything I want?

370
00:23:24.847 --> 00:23:26.381
And what is it that you want?

371
00:23:26.914 --> 00:23:28.923
You, CEO Park.

372
00:23:35.937 --> 00:23:38.735
Making you cringe is addictive.
I got addicted for just a moment.

373
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:45.011
Oh, so this is what it feels like
to be on the receiving end.

374
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.613
I'll refuse, for now.

375
00:23:48.232 --> 00:23:50.082
Want to just call me Big Bro?

376
00:23:51.062 --> 00:23:53.121
I don't make offers like this
to just anyone, you know.

377
00:23:53.638 --> 00:23:55.378
Maybe a couple of years down the line.

378
00:23:55.378 --> 00:23:57.248
But if I do open my own restaurant...

379
00:24:00.157 --> 00:24:01.591
I'll open it with you, Big Bro.

380
00:24:05.988 --> 00:24:08.104
Try this and see if it's any good.

381
00:24:08.469 --> 00:24:11.031
I want a critique from
Chef Ohn Jung Seon.

382
00:24:16.081 --> 00:24:17.875
Yum!

383
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.956
You cooked the noodles
a little too much.

384
00:24:21.685 --> 00:24:23.971
This is how I usually
like my noodles.

385
00:24:31.416 --> 00:24:33.542
Hello, this is Lee Hyun Soo.

386
00:24:33.542 --> 00:24:36.741
I'm calling you because there's
something I want to talk to you about.

387
00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:38.952
When do you have time?

388
00:24:51.746 --> 00:24:53.754
Sorry for making you
come all this way.

389
00:24:53.754 --> 00:24:55.359
It's all right.

390
00:24:55.359 --> 00:24:57.946
The person who has something to say
should be the one to travel.

391
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.288
And what is it that
you wanted to say?

392
00:25:05.012 --> 00:25:07.321
I'll accept the offer
you made me last time.

393
00:25:07.321 --> 00:25:09.071
3 million won per month.

394
00:25:16.457 --> 00:25:19.212
Only if the offer is
still valid, though.

395
00:25:19.212 --> 00:25:21.051
Can you start working tomorrow?

396
00:25:21.754 --> 00:25:22.917
Of course!

397
00:25:30.284 --> 00:25:31.688
Want to try hitting one?

398
00:25:31.688 --> 00:25:33.750
No, I'm not really in the mood
for that right now.

399
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:38.089
You have to do what the owner tells
you to do even if you're not in the mood.

400
00:25:38.089 --> 00:25:40.494
That's how a company works.

401
00:25:40.494 --> 00:25:44.029
You have to do whatever you're
told even if it pisses you off.

402
00:25:46.196 --> 00:25:47.695
I'll do it.

403
00:26:02.794 --> 00:26:03.870
Whoa!

404
00:26:05.812 --> 00:26:07.753
Can I give it another shot?

405
00:26:07.753 --> 00:26:09.240
- No.
- Why not?

406
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.735
Because you want to.

407
00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:13.998
Let's go and eat something.

408
00:26:15.877 --> 00:26:18.198
Do we have to eat? I don't
really want to, though.

409
00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:22.986
I mean, um...

410
00:26:23.637 --> 00:26:25.283
don't you feel uncomfortable

411
00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:27.365
watching people do something
you forced them to do?

412
00:26:27.365 --> 00:26:28.476
Not in the slightest.

413
00:26:28.476 --> 00:26:31.636
You're doing it against your will
because you don't want to upset me.

414
00:26:31.636 --> 00:26:34.331
That's only possible for me
if I have power.

415
00:26:34.331 --> 00:26:38.058
Oh, so you like having power, I see.

416
00:26:38.995 --> 00:26:40.556
Yep, I do.

417
00:26:42.043 --> 00:26:46.408
I'll happily eat, Sir,
instead of forcing myself!

418
00:26:46.408 --> 00:26:48.264
Want me to send this to you
as a package?

419
00:26:48.264 --> 00:26:51.320
No, can you hold on to it for me
for the time being?

420
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.938
Sure.

421
00:26:52.938 --> 00:26:55.004
What did Hyun Soo say?

422
00:26:55.004 --> 00:26:59.042
The situation is a bit grim, since
Ms. Hyun Soo has her own life, too.

423
00:26:59.042 --> 00:27:01.317
You didn't ask her to
wait for you, did you?

424
00:27:01.317 --> 00:27:03.532
You really know nothing about women.

425
00:27:03.532 --> 00:27:06.195
For women, love trumps all!

426
00:27:06.195 --> 00:27:09.123
Hyun Soo's mind is all over the place now
since she's looking for a part-time job.

427
00:27:09.123 --> 00:27:11.196
So if you tell her to
wait for you now

428
00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:12.443
she'll love it.

429
00:27:12.443 --> 00:27:15.395
You're saying this because
you know nothing about her.

430
00:27:15.395 --> 00:27:17.299
To her, work is more important than love.

431
00:27:17.299 --> 00:27:19.093
- Did you ask her?
- I did ask her.

432
00:27:19.093 --> 00:27:21.385
It's because you only asked
her once! You should've asked twice!

433
00:27:21.385 --> 00:27:24.700
There's no way she'd say yes immediately
when she's older than you.

434
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.559
How do you have such little common sense?

435
00:27:32.302 --> 00:27:33.491
Wait, really?

436
00:27:33.491 --> 00:27:34.629
Yeah.

437
00:27:34.629 --> 00:27:38.369
Call her before you leave and
see if she picks up or not.

438
00:27:38.369 --> 00:27:39.948
She's not the type to ignore calls.

439
00:27:39.948 --> 00:27:41.655
She might pick up and
reject me, though.

440
00:27:55.742 --> 00:27:57.837
Your palate is just like
a little kid's, CEO Park.

441
00:27:57.837 --> 00:28:00.232
My mother used to make this for me
often when I was young.

442
00:28:00.232 --> 00:28:01.740
I eat it when I miss her.

443
00:28:02.577 --> 00:28:04.543
You can just go see her if
you want, can't you?

444
00:28:12.234 --> 00:28:13.803
I'm sorry.

445
00:28:13.803 --> 00:28:16.750
Looks like I asked a low-caliber
question again.

446
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:21.177
Did your mother pass away?

447
00:28:21.177 --> 00:28:22.733
Yeah.

448
00:28:24.217 --> 00:28:26.283
How old were you
when it happened?
