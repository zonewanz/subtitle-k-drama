1
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:39.926
- It's dangerous. - What is?

2
00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:41.695
I've gained weight. I'm heavy.

3
00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:42.762
You're not.

4
00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:46.232
What?

5
00:00:47.434 --> 00:00:49.302
Why did the power go out suddenly?

6
00:00:49.803 --> 00:00:51.571
I'll go check the fuse box.

7
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:53.206
Watch out when you go down the stairs.

8
00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:54.240
Okay.

9
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:12.292
What was that?

10
00:01:21.735 --> 00:01:22.802
Honey.

11
00:01:32.612 --> 00:01:35.014
Chungmyung Police station requested cooperation...

12
00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:36.683
related to a serial sex offender.

13
00:01:37.183 --> 00:01:39.853
6 months ago, 4 university students were raped...

14
00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:42.522
in Christian university located in Chungmyung.

15
00:01:42.722 --> 00:01:45.392
4 female students were raped once every 10 days.

16
00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:48.561
It stopped for six months,

17
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.231
then it began with completely different targets 15 days ago.

18
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:56.202
The second victim, Jung Jin Hee, 37.

19
00:01:56.436 --> 00:01:58.271
She was raped 15 days ago.

20
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:01.941
She's currently in Bookyung where her parents live.

21
00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:04.611
There was an additional rape...

22
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:07.480
a week ago in a house in Palbongro, Chungmyung.

23
00:02:08.782 --> 00:02:10.850
Her name's Choi Yu Rim, 34.

24
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.586
Her boyfriend, Kim Jae Seok, was with her at the time,

25
00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:16.322
and the culprit smashed the back of his head.

26
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:20.760
Compared to the previous victims,

27
00:02:20.894 --> 00:02:22.862
the current victims are in their mid 30s.

28
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:27.233
There's no correlation between the victims.

29
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.636
How do you know it's done by a same person?

30
00:02:29.903 --> 00:02:32.772
The culprit left a same voice message to the victims.

31
00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:40.213
I can give you everything you want.

32
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.016
We were lucky to restore one of the victims'...

33
00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:44.684
broken cell phone.

34
00:02:44.884 --> 00:02:48.054
I can narrow down the age by analyzing the voice.

35
00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:51.791
The culprit's exposing himself through the message...

36
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:53.960
as if he's showing off.

37
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.463
He's not trying to hide himself at all.

38
00:02:56.763 --> 00:02:58.131
Upon hearing the message,

39
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:01.100
it sounds like the culprit knows the victims well.

40
00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:04.270
Was it possible to assume suspects in the initial investigation?

41
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:05.772
No. Not yet.

42
00:03:05.772 --> 00:03:08.141
The message's distinctive, but what's more unique is that...

43
00:03:08.274 --> 00:03:10.643
starting with Choi Yu Rim a week ago,

44
00:03:10.643 --> 00:03:13.012
the culprit left a witness on purpose.

45
00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:15.415
Did the boyfriend witness the scene of crime?

46
00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:18.284
Yes. The boyfriend was there,

47
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.420
and he lost his consciousness.

48
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:22.722
If there are several victims,

49
00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:25.191
they could outline the culprit's features.

50
00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.495
The thing is, the culprit raped the victims so cruelly...

51
00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:30.263
that they can't remember it.

52
00:03:30.763 --> 00:03:33.800
Even their testimony is ambiguous.

53
00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:37.971
They said he breathed heavily, had sharp appearance,

54
00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:39.873
and he wore a cap.

55
00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:43.042
Any connections with ex-convicts?

56
00:03:43.576 --> 00:03:45.912
Police secured the culprit's hair from the scene of crime...

57
00:03:45.912 --> 00:03:48.281
and went through a DNA test,

58
00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:50.416
but couldn't find any match.

59
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.786
First victims were religious university students.

60
00:03:54.153 --> 00:03:56.623
He had six months...

61
00:03:56.623 --> 00:04:00.126
until he raped Jung Jin Hee and Choi Yu Rim.

62
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.763
He selected completely different crime targets.

63
00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:08.735
It's important to figure out why the culprit changed his targets.

64
00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:11.271
We need to find out what the six months' time means...

65
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.841
to the culprit while he stopped the rape.

66
00:04:15.842 --> 00:04:18.111
How's Choi Yu Rim's condition?

67
00:04:19.012 --> 00:04:20.213
She's in hospital.

68
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.350
Sun Woo and Min Young can go talk to the victims in hospital,

69
00:04:25.084 --> 00:04:27.620
and Nana can join us at the police station.

70
00:04:27.954 --> 00:04:30.690
What? Me too?

71
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.325
You begin the interrogation.

72
00:04:42.702 --> 00:04:44.470
When we look at the first victims' houses,

73
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.973
they either lived in a studio or a rooftop house.

74
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.710
Their neighbors could hear their scream.

75
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.312
Why didn't they hear anything?

76
00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:55.582
There's no trace of break-in at the victims' houses.

77
00:04:56.182 --> 00:04:59.152
No one knew until the victims reported.

78
00:04:59.852 --> 00:05:01.955
How did he get inside the house?

79
00:05:03.122 --> 00:05:05.925
The culprit's committing crimes...

80
00:05:05.925 --> 00:05:07.293
using his own pattern.

81
00:05:07.594 --> 00:05:09.963
He made the victims to open the door for him...

82
00:05:10.063 --> 00:05:12.265
as if he was invited.

83
00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:16.202
He might have a record of burglary.

84
00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:18.271
No. I don't think so.

85
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:20.640
If he was going for an empty house,

86
00:05:21.074 --> 00:05:23.242
he wouldn't harass the victims this much.

87
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:29.482
The culprit raped the victims multiple times in the same place.

88
00:05:30.316 --> 00:05:31.751
Multiple times?

89
00:05:34.954 --> 00:05:37.890
It turns out Palbongro area where Choi lives...

90
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:40.994
had a power outage for two hours on the day of the crime.

91
00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:44.263
The culprit was aiming for the moment...

92
00:05:44.263 --> 00:05:47.133
when the victim's scared in the dark.

93
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.771
The culprit wanted to see the victims scared in the dark.

94
00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:54.040
The victims testified that...

95
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.044
before they were raped, they heard a loud noise outside.

96
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:00.313
He was trying to distract them.

97
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.815
That's when he got into the house.

98
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.292
- I'm Team Manager Hong Sang Mi. - I'm Kang Ki Hyung.

99
00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:14.794
I'm in charge of this case.

100
00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:18.731
As you know, my sexual crimes team is simple.

101
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.533
It's cost-effective.

102
00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:24.971
You requested us as soon as you got the report.

103
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:26.406
Yes.

104
00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:30.810
I thought I should find out the reason he changed the targets...

105
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.146
through profiling to narrow down the suspect.

106
00:06:33.413 --> 00:06:36.115
I heard you were Agent Ha's senior...

107
00:06:36.182 --> 00:06:37.550
when she just became a police officer.

108
00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:42.321
Yes. We drank so much every time the culprits we caught...

109
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:43.990
were released.

110
00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:47.293
I can't imagine Sun Woo doing so.

111
00:06:49.762 --> 00:06:52.331
You'll have to talk through with the victims.

112
00:06:53.032 --> 00:06:55.401
You'll find female agents more helpful.

113
00:06:56.302 --> 00:06:59.405
If you need my help, I'm more than willing to help you.

114
00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:00.940
- Sure. - Okay.

115
00:07:03.743 --> 00:07:05.745
(Emergency Center)

116
00:07:10.483 --> 00:07:12.752
Why did they tie her arms up?

117
00:07:13.853 --> 00:07:16.122
I heard she attempted suicide multiple times.

118
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.161
Choi Yu Rim?

119
00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:26.733
We're...

120
00:07:28.034 --> 00:07:29.702
from NCI.

121
00:07:32.371 --> 00:07:34.073
Do you remember anything new...

122
00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:35.975
that happened on the day of the crime?

123
00:07:40.913 --> 00:07:42.115
I know it's hard,

124
00:07:42.982 --> 00:07:45.852
but try to recall the memory please.

125
00:07:49.222 --> 00:07:51.290
Do you remember the culprit's face?

126
00:07:57.864 --> 00:07:59.132
When I close my eyes,

127
00:08:00.032 --> 00:08:01.601
I can see his face.

128
00:08:03.302 --> 00:08:06.906
I can't even open my eyes anymore.

129
00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:13.412
Please.

130
00:08:13.613 --> 00:08:15.681
Please...

131
00:08:16.082 --> 00:08:17.583
How long do I have to...

132
00:08:17.583 --> 00:08:18.751
It's all right.

133
00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:21.621
Let's stop here.

134
00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:24.023
We'll come back later.

135
00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:34.500
Analysis of his voice...

136
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.501
shows that...

137
00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:38.471
the culprit was a male in his mid to late 30s.

138
00:08:39.272 --> 00:08:41.574
He would have been someone...

139
00:08:41.574 --> 00:08:43.776
who could watch the victims all day.

140
00:08:43.776 --> 00:08:45.511
We investigated and interrogated...

141
00:08:45.511 --> 00:08:47.713
people around the victims for the last year,

142
00:08:47.713 --> 00:08:50.016
but we could not find anyone who was suspicious.

143
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.753
The culprit would have no personal relationship with the victims,

144
00:08:54.053 --> 00:08:56.923
but he would have talked to the victims at least once.

145
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.560
He would be nice looking and good at conversations.

146
00:09:00.693 --> 00:09:02.461
The victims probably don't remember the culprit...

147
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:05.164
because they didn't feel hostility towards him.

148
00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:07.900
It would be possible if he was someone that everyone can meet.

149
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.203
He could be a real estate agent,

150
00:09:10.403 --> 00:09:12.672
service technician, internet installation engineer...

151
00:09:12.672 --> 00:09:14.140
I'm sorry to interrupt,

152
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.576
but we have interrogated every one of those people.

153
00:09:17.143 --> 00:09:19.846
No, you must have made a mistake.

154
00:09:20.213 --> 00:09:22.181
The victims were of different age,

155
00:09:22.181 --> 00:09:25.985
they had different jobs, and they led different lives.

156
00:09:26.052 --> 00:09:28.621
Seeing as the culprit set them as the target,

157
00:09:29.055 --> 00:09:31.390
he must have lived near the victims...

158
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.694
or had jobs that had something to do with the victims.

159
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:37.630
(Emergency Center)

160
00:09:39.232 --> 00:09:40.533
At least the weather is nice.

161
00:09:48.674 --> 00:09:50.443
He would have watched...

162
00:09:50.443 --> 00:09:52.511
the victims from where he worked.

163
00:09:52.712 --> 00:09:56.315
He would have only committed the crime when his fantasy could be met.

164
00:09:58.551 --> 00:10:00.453
This means...

165
00:10:00.453 --> 00:10:02.121
that he has access to...

166
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:04.824
not only the victims but to everyone.

167
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:06.792
- Min Ah? - That'd be me.

168
00:10:07.026 --> 00:10:09.161
- Thank you. - He could be a cable engineer,

169
00:10:09.161 --> 00:10:11.130
a gasman, or a maintenance engineer for water purifiers.

170
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.132
If you widen your thoughts from there,

171
00:10:13.132 --> 00:10:16.702
He would work at a place where women can easily talk to men.

172
00:10:17.036 --> 00:10:19.071
He could work at a beauty parlor, a cosmetics store,

173
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:21.440
a library, a post office,

174
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.444
a delivery service, or a convenience store.

175
00:10:29.215 --> 00:10:32.451
Did anyone suspicious come to you after the incident?

176
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:34.620
I told you everything six months ago.

177
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.822
Can't you just check the records?

178
00:10:37.423 --> 00:10:38.491
Sun Young,

179
00:10:38.925 --> 00:10:40.326
I know this is hard for you.

180
00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:42.995
But the number of victims is increasing.

181
00:10:49.101 --> 00:10:52.104
I'm sorry, but we need to know.

182
00:10:52.104 --> 00:10:53.973
I'd like to ask you again.

183
00:10:54.173 --> 00:10:56.175
Was there anyone near you...

184
00:10:56.175 --> 00:10:58.945
who kept circling you quietly?

185
00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:00.446
Ms. Hong,

186
00:11:02.081 --> 00:11:04.884
I'd like to talk to Sun Young alone.

187
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:11.924
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:15.361
We should have been more considerate.

189
00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:19.131
I'm an information specialist at NCI.

190
00:11:19.332 --> 00:11:21.434
I'm not an expert at profiling.

191
00:11:25.671 --> 00:11:26.906
There is no one in particular...

192
00:11:29.842 --> 00:11:31.711
that I can think of.

193
00:11:34.113 --> 00:11:37.550
Is there anyone who suddenly quit a club, a gathering,

194
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.085
or took time off from school?

195
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.122
It wasn't someone around me.

196
00:11:45.825 --> 00:11:47.860
I know that much.

197
00:11:49.962 --> 00:11:51.063
We think that the culprit...

198
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.133
has been stalking other victims.

199
00:11:55.334 --> 00:11:56.802
Did the culprit...

200
00:11:57.136 --> 00:11:59.071
try to talk to you about something?

201
00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:00.873
I don't remember anything else,

202
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.641
but...

203
00:12:03.376 --> 00:12:05.745
he had said something really scary to me.

204
00:12:09.115 --> 00:12:10.683
Look at me.

205
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.652
Look at me.

206
00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:16.422
Look.

207
00:12:17.223 --> 00:12:18.324
Look at me.

208
00:12:23.095 --> 00:12:24.263
The police...

209
00:12:25.231 --> 00:12:27.500
told me that he hadn't killed me or anything,

210
00:12:27.633 --> 00:12:30.503
so I should forget about it as if it was a bad dream.

211
00:12:31.303 --> 00:12:33.773
They said there were many people who were killed in the end,

212
00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:36.242
and that it was a relief.

213
00:12:38.344 --> 00:12:39.512
But...

214
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.452
is it really a relief?

215
00:13:01.834 --> 00:13:03.903
Before committing the crime, there's order.

216
00:13:03.903 --> 00:13:07.373
But during the process, he becomes disorderly and violent.

217
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.075
That means...

218
00:13:09.075 --> 00:13:11.811
he's angry when he commits these crimes.

219
00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:15.114
That's probably why he is violent.

220
00:13:18.651 --> 00:13:21.554
"I heard a sound after the electricity went off."

221
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.790
"That's when the culprit came inside through the open door."

222
00:13:26.692 --> 00:13:29.462
It's not like other crime patterns.

223
00:13:29.595 --> 00:13:31.330
Especially sexual assault crimes.

224
00:13:31.864 --> 00:13:33.933
Before committing the crime,

225
00:13:33.933 --> 00:13:35.601
he plans it inside his head,

226
00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:37.002
and then he carries it out.

227
00:13:37.603 --> 00:13:40.106
He must get excited while he watches...

228
00:13:40.106 --> 00:13:42.641
the victims panic in disorder...

229
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:44.043
after he turns off the electricity.

230
00:13:46.512 --> 00:13:48.581
Please check if there were...

231
00:13:48.614 --> 00:13:51.283
similar cases like this in the past.

232
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:54.053
I was actually searching for cases.

233
00:13:54.653 --> 00:13:55.821
I'll conduct a nation-wide search...

234
00:13:55.821 --> 00:13:58.224
on cases in which the culprit stole from or broke into houses...

235
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.693
while the electricity was turned off.

236
00:14:00.693 --> 00:14:01.694
All right.

237
00:14:02.361 --> 00:14:06.332
Are you guessing that the culprit committed other crimes before this?

238
00:14:06.465 --> 00:14:08.334
Seeing as he plans his crimes,

239
00:14:08.334 --> 00:14:11.971
it's likely that he started with burglary or breaking into houses.

240
00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:14.840
If you look at the crime patterns, he's very bold...

241
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.442
and confident.

242
00:14:16.876 --> 00:14:18.911
During his second crime, he didn't try to hide anything.

243
00:14:19.011 --> 00:14:21.280
He even left a witness to his crime.

244
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.115
He leaves messages and witnesses,

245
00:14:23.115 --> 00:14:26.952
makes the victims look at his face forcefully,

246
00:14:27.052 --> 00:14:29.121
and vents his violent anger towards the victims.

247
00:14:30.222 --> 00:14:31.690
What do they mean?

248
00:14:32.691 --> 00:14:36.195
They could have something to do an experience in the past.

249
00:14:36.562 --> 00:14:38.931
And we need to find that story.

250
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:43.302
The fact that he has left a witness could be a message in itself.

251
00:14:43.636 --> 00:14:44.770
The culprit...

252
00:14:45.204 --> 00:14:48.440
is asking someone to keep an eye on him.

253
00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:50.142
Whoever it is,

254
00:14:50.643 --> 00:14:53.145
it must be someone from the culprit's past.

255
00:14:53.612 --> 00:14:56.515
There must be more victims that we don't know of yet.

256
00:14:57.082 --> 00:15:00.953
Only 11 percent of rape victims report to the police in Korea.

257
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.023
The victims from the first case were all Christians.

258
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.824
It would have been harder for them to report.

259
00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:08.160
The culprit would have taken that into account as well.

260
00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:11.230
He would have chosen victims who are unlikely to report.

261
00:15:13.832 --> 00:15:16.302
Why do you think he stopped for six months?

262
00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:21.440
There must have been a reason why he had changed his mind.

263
00:15:23.142 --> 00:15:25.411
It would have something to do with the reason he changed his targets.

264
00:15:26.912 --> 00:15:28.480
It's been a while since you worked together,

265
00:15:28.681 --> 00:15:30.115
and yet it looks very familiar.

266
00:15:30.683 --> 00:15:33.686
I didn't know she started her career here.

267
00:15:33.953 --> 00:15:34.954
I didn't...

268
00:15:35.254 --> 00:15:39.391
know that she'd be so successful.

269
00:15:41.093 --> 00:15:45.231
Is NCI going to be officially leading the investigation?

270
00:15:46.432 --> 00:15:49.435
The culprit would be looking for his next victim.

271
00:15:49.535 --> 00:15:52.104
We must move before he does.

272
00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:54.540
Was there anyone suspicious around the victims?

273
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.342
I think I have something.

274
00:15:56.842 --> 00:15:58.911
Six months ago, a female student from Chungmyung University...

275
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:00.679
committed suicide.

276
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.315
Did she report any sexual assaults?

277
00:16:03.582 --> 00:16:04.950
No, she didn't.

278
00:16:05.284 --> 00:16:07.419
She committed suicide during the period...

279
00:16:07.653 --> 00:16:10.322
in which the culprit had stopped committing his crimes.

280
00:16:13.726 --> 00:16:14.960
I don't know why...

281
00:16:15.594 --> 00:16:18.464
So Hee has anything to do with the incidents you are talking about.

282
00:16:18.631 --> 00:16:19.665
Have you...

283
00:16:20.366 --> 00:16:23.535
heard about the suicide incident in Chungmyung University?

284
00:16:24.403 --> 00:16:25.371
Of course.

285
00:16:25.704 --> 00:16:27.740
The story was all over the media.

286
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.575
We think...

287
00:16:29.842 --> 00:16:33.112
that So Hee has something to do with the incident.

288
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.982
What are you trying to say?

289
00:16:37.683 --> 00:16:39.451
That's not possible.

290
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.121
My daughter...

291
00:16:42.454 --> 00:16:44.623
wasn't someone who would be the target of such crimes.

292
00:16:44.623 --> 00:16:45.791
Honey.

293
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.830
Did So Hee leave a will?

294
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.101
I'm sorry,

295
00:16:56.702 --> 00:16:58.871
but may we take a look at it?

296
00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:00.773
There was no such thing.

297
00:17:14.053 --> 00:17:15.921
Team Manager Kang, I searched...

298
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:18.791
for similar cases in the past as you asked me.

299
00:17:19.325 --> 00:17:21.193
There have been multiple cases...

300
00:17:21.193 --> 00:17:24.630
that show similar traits at the cities on the outskirts of Seoul...

301
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.133
like Moohyun, Hajeong, Songro, and Yuljeong since five years ago.

302
00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:30.602
Five years ago,

303
00:17:30.602 --> 00:17:32.771
there have been housebreaking cases in Moohyun.

304
00:17:32.905 --> 00:17:34.673
But since the incident that happened in Hajeong,

305
00:17:34.673 --> 00:17:36.442
it was turned into burglary.

306
00:17:36.642 --> 00:17:39.845
All the cases happened after there was no electricity.

307
00:17:40.145 --> 00:17:42.014
During the last crime that happened in Yuljeong,

308
00:17:42.715 --> 00:17:44.983
the culprit violently killed...

309
00:17:44.983 --> 00:17:46.852
a dog that was in the yard.

310
00:17:47.152 --> 00:17:48.921
All the victims from the first and second cases...

311
00:17:49.021 --> 00:17:51.690
have something to do with the fact that the electricity had gone out.

312
00:18:14.813 --> 00:18:17.282
The suspect would choose a target in advance...

313
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.352
and cut the electricity off on purpose.

314
00:18:20.552 --> 00:18:21.620
That's strange.

315
00:18:21.954 --> 00:18:23.989
Look at the direction the suspect moved.

316
00:18:26.091 --> 00:18:29.995
It starts here, and it connects all the way to Chungmyung,

317
00:18:30.195 --> 00:18:32.831
as if this is his final destination.

318
00:18:32.931 --> 00:18:34.199
The final destination?

319
00:18:35.634 --> 00:18:37.603
It must mean a case that started in Chungmyung...

320
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.571
became the trigger.

321
00:18:40.973 --> 00:18:44.109
Nana, let's narrow it down to men in their 30s...

322
00:18:44.343 --> 00:18:46.545
and focus on people from Chungmyung.

323
00:18:46.545 --> 00:18:48.580
Let's do the background check for past cases again.

324
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.681
Yes, sir.

325
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.421
Sir, this is hard for us to bring up too.

326
00:18:56.221 --> 00:18:59.525
We'll return So Hee's will after the investigation.

327
00:18:59.525 --> 00:19:00.592
It's hard?

328
00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.129
What's hard? If it's so hard,

329
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.133
why did you come six months after she was buried...

330
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.670
to ask me about how she died? How does this make sense?

331
00:19:15.174 --> 00:19:16.742
Both my husband and I...

332
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.012
are just barely living on.

333
00:19:23.182 --> 00:19:26.251
I'm very sorry that we're asking you at this time,

334
00:19:27.352 --> 00:19:29.822
but we don't want more people to be victimized like her.

335
00:19:30.522 --> 00:19:32.491
We'll do our best to prevent it.

336
00:19:36.962 --> 00:19:38.330
I'm sorry,

337
00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:42.501
but we don't want to help you anymore.

338
00:19:58.183 --> 00:19:59.251
Wait.

339
00:20:36.722 --> 00:20:37.990
Our daughter...

340
00:20:39.691 --> 00:20:41.860
was very precious to my husband.

341
00:20:45.163 --> 00:20:47.533
It's too hard for him right now.

342
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:57.442
We came too late.

343
00:21:00.412 --> 00:21:01.480
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:03.415 --> 00:21:05.784
We're her parents, but we lost her.

345
00:21:07.753 --> 00:21:09.555
We should have prevented it.

346
00:21:10.689 --> 00:21:11.690
Really?

347
00:21:12.991 --> 00:21:14.092
You're lying, right?

348
00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:30.142
(Dear fellow students, I'm writing because I need your help.)

349
00:21:33.912 --> 00:21:36.982
(Reply: No way! I would die! Reply: I know who she is.)

350
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.801
So Hee...

351
00:21:56.902 --> 00:21:59.371
was pregnant due to the rape.

352
00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:38.910
(Suicide, suicide)

353
00:22:45.684 --> 00:22:46.785
Mom,

354
00:22:47.552 --> 00:22:48.620
Dad,

355
00:22:49.855 --> 00:22:51.490
I'm sorry...

356
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.625
I'm a disappointing daughter.

357
00:22:56.361 --> 00:22:58.630
The reason why the criminal stopped committing crimes...

358
00:22:59.431 --> 00:23:01.900
was because of So Hee's suicide six months ago.

359
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.469
He could have felt guilty.

360
00:23:04.903 --> 00:23:06.872
He must think that he killed her.

361
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.441
After that,

362
00:23:10.042 --> 00:23:12.210
his sadistic characteristic would have magnified.

363
00:23:15.514 --> 00:23:17.182
Looking at the state Choi Yu Rim is in,

364
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.752
it won't be long before he commits murder.

365
00:23:24.122 --> 00:23:26.224
Ms. Hong told me you're a good soju drinker.

366
00:23:26.391 --> 00:23:27.459
Is this true?

367
00:23:29.895 --> 00:23:33.331
Well, I guess it wouldn't be so easy to be in a team...

368
00:23:33.765 --> 00:23:35.000
that focuses on sexual assault cases.

369
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.371
Prior to leaving the team, I had to take a difficult case.

370
00:23:40.305 --> 00:23:41.339
What was it?

371
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.342
Was it difficult even for an NCI agent?

372
00:23:49.915 --> 00:23:52.451
There's always a first in everything...

373
00:23:53.685 --> 00:23:56.421
whether that beginning is painful or happy.

374
00:23:57.022 --> 00:23:58.590
They must have a reason of its own.

375
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.695
I must be here now...

376
00:24:04.429 --> 00:24:06.565
because of my time there.

377
00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:15.240
Sir.

378
00:24:16.341 --> 00:24:19.511
There is something I have to check with Choi Yu Rim.

379
00:24:29.221 --> 00:24:30.422
Did the culprit...

380
00:24:31.823 --> 00:24:35.494
mention anything about children or family?

381
00:24:36.094 --> 00:24:37.095
No.

382
00:24:37.662 --> 00:24:41.399
Then did he say anything about his misfortunes...

383
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.470
or about his relationship with other people?

384
00:24:47.639 --> 00:24:51.409
There was no chance for me to talk with him.

385
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.145
One of the victims...

386
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.715
found out that she was pregnant with his child...

387
00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:00.652
and took her own life.

388
00:25:07.993 --> 00:25:11.563
Yu Rim, did you think of something?

389
00:25:25.143 --> 00:25:26.812
Actually,

390
00:25:27.712 --> 00:25:29.581
I was trying to get pregnant.

391
00:25:30.749 --> 00:25:32.150
I'm getting old.

392
00:25:34.119 --> 00:25:36.721
I couldn't tell my boyfriend,

393
00:25:38.223 --> 00:25:41.793
but I went to get consultation from the fertility clinic.

394
00:25:45.564 --> 00:25:46.631
He...

395
00:25:47.532 --> 00:25:49.401
didn't want a baby.

396
00:25:49.801 --> 00:25:51.203
When did that happen?

397
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:57.075
I visited the clinic about a month before the incident.

398
00:25:57.442 --> 00:25:58.810
Did you...

399
00:25:59.544 --> 00:26:01.713
tell anyone about it?

400
00:26:01.813 --> 00:26:02.881
No.

401
00:26:04.783 --> 00:26:06.985
I jokingly mentioned to my friends...

402
00:26:08.653 --> 00:26:10.822
that I want a baby,

403
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.860
but I didn't tell anyone...

404
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.862
that I was planning for it.

405
00:26:18.463 --> 00:26:22.033
The other victim Jung Jin Hee who is also in her 30s...

406
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.570
had visited the same fertility clinic as Choi Yu Rim.

407
00:26:25.871 --> 00:26:27.072
When did she go?

408
00:26:28.173 --> 00:26:29.341
Around the same time.

409
00:26:29.841 --> 00:26:32.611
She was divorced, and she wanted a child.

410
00:26:33.912 --> 00:26:35.380
Check the hospital records.

411
00:26:35.981 --> 00:26:38.884
The culprit must be a staff at the clinic,

412
00:26:39.484 --> 00:26:42.320
or someone who can easily approach the patient records.

413
00:26:42.354 --> 00:26:44.823
Yes, sir. There's one more thing.

414
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.825
Both of the victims...

415
00:26:46.825 --> 00:26:50.095
were prescribed with Clomifene, a medication that induces ovulation.

416
00:26:50.395 --> 00:26:53.431
Before the medication shows effects,

417
00:26:53.632 --> 00:26:55.700
the clinic wouldn't perform any procedures on patients.

418
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.941
The culprit approached the victims knowing they were taking Clomifene.

419
00:27:03.041 --> 00:27:05.010
If it was prior to getting artificial insemination,

420
00:27:05.143 --> 00:27:07.579
there would be a higher chance they would bear his child.

421
00:27:08.213 --> 00:27:11.082
If the criminal is committing sexual assault...

422
00:27:11.283 --> 00:27:14.252
to impregnate his victims,

423
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.889
then those women were perfect targets for him.

424
00:27:17.889 --> 00:27:21.192
In the beginning, he chose young and devoted Christians.

425
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.862
They're easy to control,

426
00:27:23.862 --> 00:27:26.264
and he figured they wouldn't get an abortion.

427
00:27:26.665 --> 00:27:28.433
However, when So Hee committed suicide,

428
00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.170
he changed his target to women that want babies.

429
00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.339
But why is he maltreating...

430
00:27:34.339 --> 00:27:35.674
the victims?

431
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:38.443
He might be trying to impregnate the victims...

432
00:27:38.743 --> 00:27:40.912
as a means of letting out his resentment and rage.

433
00:27:41.313 --> 00:27:45.183
If that's the case, it must be connected to a trauma.

434
00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:50.989
(Infertility Clinic)

435
00:27:50.989 --> 00:27:54.092
I'm sorry, but whoever committed such crimes...

436
00:27:54.092 --> 00:27:55.460
has nothing to do with us.

437
00:27:56.561 --> 00:27:59.064
As you can see, most staff...

438
00:27:59.064 --> 00:28:00.231
and patients are women here.

439
00:28:00.231 --> 00:28:02.033
He could be a subcontractor, supplier,

440
00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:04.169
or even from your security company.

441
00:28:04.169 --> 00:28:05.971
I'm not saying we won't cooperate.

442
00:28:06.304 --> 00:28:08.173
I'm saying there's nothing we can cooperate with.

443
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.743
It's really heartbreaking what happened.

444
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:14.112
However, you should see things from my point of view too.

445
00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.781
As you know,

446
00:28:17.882 --> 00:28:20.385
less people are getting pregnant,

447
00:28:20.385 --> 00:28:22.120
and if there's a weird rumor about us,

448
00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.022
it'll be too much damage.

449
00:28:24.589 --> 00:28:27.359
We're not interested in this hospital's...

450
00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:29.094
profit or stake.

451
00:28:29.361 --> 00:28:30.395
One thing for sure is that...

452
00:28:30.562 --> 00:28:32.964
victims were raped...

453
00:28:33.031 --> 00:28:34.833
after they went to this hospital.

454
00:28:37.602 --> 00:28:39.704
Can you fill this out please?

455
00:28:40.672 --> 00:28:42.240
What's that form?

456
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:44.209
Excuse me.

457
00:28:45.343 --> 00:28:48.480
It's a simple survey to provide customized service...

458
00:28:48.513 --> 00:28:49.714
to patients.

459
00:28:49.714 --> 00:28:50.782
Team Manager Kang.

460
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.592
Has this been leaked?

461
00:29:02.293 --> 00:29:03.595
Has this...

462
00:29:04.662 --> 00:29:07.232
even been leaked?

463
00:29:07.399 --> 00:29:08.833
I sold this once...

464
00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:11.503
to a research company,

465
00:29:11.503 --> 00:29:15.440
but we never leaked patients' medical record.

466
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.441
I'll keep that in mind.

467
00:29:16.674 --> 00:29:17.709
No.

468
00:29:18.143 --> 00:29:19.511
Hold on.

469
00:29:19.511 --> 00:29:21.813
Can you talk to me in private for a minute?

470
00:29:21.813 --> 00:29:24.749
The police will explain to you about the related laws.

471
00:29:25.083 --> 00:29:26.051
No.

472
00:29:28.453 --> 00:29:31.222
Look into a research company named Happy Finding.

473
00:29:31.222 --> 00:29:33.625
- Sure, Team Manager Kang. - Find out...

474
00:29:33.625 --> 00:29:35.560
if it's related to the university the victims went.

475
00:29:35.894 --> 00:29:37.429
(Chungmyung Christian University)

476
00:29:37.762 --> 00:29:41.032
They were in charge of new students' orientation.

477
00:29:41.199 --> 00:29:42.233
Okay.

478
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.601
Let's go to Happy Finding.

479
00:29:43.601 --> 00:29:44.602
Yes, sir.

480
00:29:46.971 --> 00:29:50.041
We're researching on the university students' awareness.

481
00:29:50.041 --> 00:29:53.244
The first question is...

482
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:59.551
Are you sure our ex-employee did it?

483
00:29:59.784 --> 00:30:01.619
I need the database of research...

484
00:30:01.953 --> 00:30:04.522
from infertility clinic and Chungmyung Christian University.

485
00:30:04.622 --> 00:30:07.392
You're not sure if he's our employee yet.

486
00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:08.593
If you want,

487
00:30:08.593 --> 00:30:11.563
we can always come back with a warrant in an hour.

488
00:30:13.565 --> 00:30:15.934
Team Manager Kang. I sorted out...

489
00:30:15.934 --> 00:30:20.071
single men from early 30s to early 40s who worked...

490
00:30:20.071 --> 00:30:23.675
at Happy Finding from 10 years ago until now.

491
00:30:24.142 --> 00:30:25.910
I have 20 on the list.

492
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.681
Find an employee who has a record of calling the victims.

493
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:31.082
There are three.

494
00:30:32.884 --> 00:30:35.820
All three aren't related to the past crime.

495
00:30:36.221 --> 00:30:38.823
They've all left the company.

496
00:30:38.923 --> 00:30:40.792
We need to figure out...

497
00:30:41.259 --> 00:30:43.461
a potential victim among the survey participants.

498
00:30:43.461 --> 00:30:46.631
The culprit knew well about the victims' house structure.

499
00:30:46.764 --> 00:30:47.932
He cut the power...

500
00:30:47.932 --> 00:30:50.235
and went in through unlocked door.

501
00:30:50.869 --> 00:30:53.371
Do you think it's related vocationally?

502
00:31:05.783 --> 00:31:09.053
Why would you stay naked? What if you catch a cold?

503
00:31:09.087 --> 00:31:10.822
Come here. Dry.

504
00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:54.866
Hey, Ga Ram.

505
00:31:55.333 --> 00:31:56.935
Let's go sleep inside.

506
00:31:57.502 --> 00:31:58.636
Come here, Ga Ram.

507
00:31:59.003 --> 00:32:00.805
There, there.

508
00:32:01.806 --> 00:32:02.907
Come here.

509
00:32:03.208 --> 00:32:06.844
There, there. Okay.

510
00:32:07.512 --> 00:32:08.947
Let's go.

511
00:32:16.454 --> 00:32:17.722
Sleep tight.

512
00:32:31.336 --> 00:32:32.537
An unidentified man broke into...

513
00:32:32.537 --> 00:32:35.873
an elementary school teacher Park's house last night at 10pm...

514
00:32:35.873 --> 00:32:38.476
and got away after raping Park.

515
00:32:38.476 --> 00:32:39.844
It turns out..

516
00:32:39.844 --> 00:32:43.915
- he's a serial rapist... - A word, please.

517
00:32:43.915 --> 00:32:45.984
who raped university students in Chungmyung...

518
00:32:45.984 --> 00:32:49.053
for three months starting in November, 2016.

519
00:32:49.354 --> 00:32:52.056
It turns out that the police...

520
00:32:52.056 --> 00:32:54.993
hid the existence of the rapist...

521
00:32:54.993 --> 00:32:57.495
who raped four female university students,

522
00:32:57.495 --> 00:33:00.098
and two more women after them.

523
00:33:00.098 --> 00:33:03.034
Unfortunately, it is still not...

524
00:33:03.034 --> 00:33:07.171
NCI's trying its best to resolve the case as soon as possible.

525
00:33:07.171 --> 00:33:09.374
There will be an official briefing soon,

526
00:33:09.374 --> 00:33:12.443
so please don't write any speculative articles or reports.

527
00:33:13.745 --> 00:33:15.146
At least the weather is nice.

528
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:25.556
Park Ga Hyun, 36.

529
00:33:25.757 --> 00:33:28.793
She raised her child alone after her husband died.

530
00:33:29.193 --> 00:33:31.963
- Where's the child? - In the room with Ms. Hong.

531
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.831
He left a witness.

532
00:33:33.831 --> 00:33:35.033
It's a relief.

533
00:33:35.566 --> 00:33:36.601
A relief?

534
00:33:36.601 --> 00:33:38.336
The culprit locked the child in the closet.

535
00:33:38.336 --> 00:33:40.705
Fortunately, he didn't see his mom being raped.

536
00:33:42.106 --> 00:33:44.208
You're saying that's a relief?

537
00:33:44.475 --> 00:33:45.476
What?

538
00:33:50.348 --> 00:33:53.885
Did the power go out from 10pm until midnight?

539
00:33:54.319 --> 00:33:55.320
Yes.

540
00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.755
It's same as the previous crime.

541
00:33:58.189 --> 00:34:00.858
The culprit left a message this time.

542
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.165
"Annunciatio dominae".

543
00:34:07.432 --> 00:34:09.233
It means the Annunciation in Latin.

544
00:34:09.233 --> 00:34:12.370
It represents the moment Gabrielle tells the Virgin Mary...

545
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.239
that she'll be pregnant.

546
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:18.710
He made the victims to see his face,

547
00:34:18.743 --> 00:34:20.211
left a witness,

548
00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:23.548
and even left a message.

549
00:34:24.982 --> 00:34:27.051
It sure is his signature.

550
00:34:27.118 --> 00:34:28.453
Now that it's open to the public,

551
00:34:28.453 --> 00:34:31.255
he wants everyone to acknowledge him.

552
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:35.860
Park Ga Hyun has nothing in common with previous victims.

553
00:34:36.227 --> 00:34:37.962
She's never been to the infertility clinic.

554
00:34:37.995 --> 00:34:40.131
Do you think the culprit changed the target again?

555
00:34:40.231 --> 00:34:41.299
If so,

556
00:34:41.532 --> 00:34:44.469
something about the victim must've stimulated the culprit.

557
00:34:44.702 --> 00:34:46.704
What's different about this case is that...

558
00:34:46.871 --> 00:34:49.807
he went after a victim with a child.

559
00:34:49.807 --> 00:34:51.676
What if the child left...

560
00:34:51.776 --> 00:34:53.611
is a message?

561
00:34:53.978 --> 00:34:56.981
It could represent his childhood.

562
00:34:57.181 --> 00:35:00.318
The fact that the culprit made the victims feel his trauma...

563
00:35:00.318 --> 00:35:03.187
is common among cruel criminals.

564
00:35:08.593 --> 00:35:09.627
Hey, Nana.

565
00:35:09.961 --> 00:35:11.396
Find out if the victim...

566
00:35:11.696 --> 00:35:14.198
participated in an organization or any online communities.

567
00:35:15.066 --> 00:35:17.001
Go meet the victim, Sun Woo.

568
00:35:17.168 --> 00:35:18.169
Yes, sir.

569
00:35:26.911 --> 00:35:28.579
I'm from NCI.

570
00:35:37.321 --> 00:35:39.957
How's Ga Ram?

571
00:35:40.658 --> 00:35:41.859
He's fine.

572
00:35:42.193 --> 00:35:44.362
One of our agents is taking care of him.

573
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:51.402
Ga Hyun.

574
00:35:53.438 --> 00:35:55.039
Can you tell me...

575
00:35:55.606 --> 00:35:57.341
what happened last night?

576
00:36:08.986 --> 00:36:10.354
Promise me...

577
00:36:13.624 --> 00:36:15.726
that you will...

578
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:18.930
arrest him...

579
00:36:20.298 --> 00:36:21.799
no matter what.

580
00:36:22.366 --> 00:36:23.367
Yes.

581
00:36:23.901 --> 00:36:25.169
I promise.

582
00:36:40.017 --> 00:36:41.252
Hi, Honey.

583
00:37:09.614 --> 00:37:10.615
Are you all right?

584
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.453
To be honest, it's a little hard.

585
00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.588
May I ask you a question?

586
00:37:19.056 --> 00:37:21.192
Sun Woo looks a little different today.

587
00:37:21.726 --> 00:37:23.561
Do you know anything about it?

588
00:37:24.495 --> 00:37:27.198
It's probably because of an incident that happened in the past.

589
00:37:28.132 --> 00:37:32.036
It's the last case she was in charge of when she worked as a task force.

590
00:37:33.971 --> 00:37:35.106
Six years ago, there was a case...

591
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.677
in which waitresses of Seowoo-dong area were abducted and raped.

592
00:37:40.378 --> 00:37:43.080
Not many people cared as they were waitresses at a bar.

593
00:37:43.881 --> 00:37:45.917
And there were not enough officers at the station to investigate.

594
00:37:46.651 --> 00:37:48.653
That was when Sun Woo volunteered to act as bait.

595
00:37:49.086 --> 00:37:50.888
She said she wouldn't have become a police officer...

596
00:37:51.022 --> 00:37:53.257
if she was going to choose who deserved to be saved.

597
00:37:53.257 --> 00:37:56.027
Tuck your hair on the right side if you think you found the culprit.

598
00:40:12.329 --> 00:40:16.100
When we arrived at the scene, the waitress had already died.

599
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.002
Sun Woo had a hard time.

600
00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.038
And she was sent to another team.

601
00:40:21.439 --> 00:40:23.607
Did you arrest the culprit then?

602
00:40:24.075 --> 00:40:26.477
Yes, he's serving his sentence now.

603
00:40:44.795 --> 00:40:46.630
I searched for suspects at the fertility clinic,

604
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:49.500
the research company, and among people around Park Ga Hyun.

605
00:40:49.734 --> 00:40:52.303
But there was no one that fit our profile.

606
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.705
Was there any women who filled the survey...

607
00:40:54.905 --> 00:40:56.807
who could be the culprit's type of target?

608
00:40:57.108 --> 00:40:59.176
Most of them were women of infertile couples.

609
00:40:59.677 --> 00:41:02.379
They don't seem like women that the victim would target.

610
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.515
I found someone from the list of suspects...

611
00:41:04.515 --> 00:41:07.284
whose hometown is Chungmyung.

612
00:41:07.785 --> 00:41:09.854
He doesn't have anything to do with the research company,

613
00:41:09.854 --> 00:41:12.389
but he was interrogated once for spreading pornography.

614
00:41:13.324 --> 00:41:15.392
His name is Choi Min Ho, and he is 34 years old.

615
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.129
He works as a security guard at a bank.

616
00:41:18.295 --> 00:41:20.164
He's the closest one to our profile.

617
00:41:20.965 --> 00:41:22.032
What about the other one?

618
00:41:23.167 --> 00:41:26.871
While I was researching on Happy Finding,

619
00:41:26.871 --> 00:41:29.807
I found out that there have been illegal database deals.

620
00:41:30.007 --> 00:41:32.977
Park Ga Hyun was in the list that has been illegally transferred.

621
00:41:33.477 --> 00:41:34.612
It's from a cafe for divorced singles.

622
00:41:35.012 --> 00:41:39.350
One of the members, Oh Ju Hwan, still lives in Chungmyung,

623
00:41:39.717 --> 00:41:43.087
and he had been interrogated as an accomplice in a similar case.

624
00:41:44.789 --> 00:41:47.124
We can't arrest a culprit because he matches our profile.

625
00:41:47.591 --> 00:41:50.161
If we move hastily before we find evidence,

626
00:41:50.628 --> 00:41:52.229
it could only have reverse effects.

627
00:41:52.396 --> 00:41:55.833
Yes. According to his pattern until now,

628
00:41:56.233 --> 00:41:58.702
he will move again in a few days.

629
00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:00.571
We need to use a bait.

630
00:42:02.406 --> 00:42:04.208
We can answer the survey with fake information.

631
00:42:06.377 --> 00:42:07.478
I will do it.

632
00:42:07.912 --> 00:42:08.913
Sun Woo.

633
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:11.615
We can't.

634
00:42:12.116 --> 00:42:13.384
We don't have time.

635
00:42:13.584 --> 00:42:16.554
There could be more victims if we don't.

636
00:42:23.861 --> 00:42:25.229
What's my profile?

637
00:42:25.329 --> 00:42:26.664
You're a deputy director at a law firm.

638
00:42:26.897 --> 00:42:29.166
You are 36 years old and divorced.

639
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.336
You answered the survey 48 hours ago.

640
00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:34.839
The research company has your information,

641
00:42:35.172 --> 00:42:37.007
so he won't overlook it.

642
00:42:39.043 --> 00:42:40.845
Act naturally...

643
00:42:41.345 --> 00:42:42.947
so that he can watch you.

644
00:42:44.215 --> 00:42:47.284
He won't wait long like he did with his former victims.

645
00:42:48.152 --> 00:42:50.754
As soon as he appears, we will go after him.

646
00:42:51.822 --> 00:42:53.057
So act calmly.

647
00:42:53.357 --> 00:42:55.292
We want him...

648
00:42:55.559 --> 00:42:57.261
to go inside.

649
00:42:57.928 --> 00:43:00.431
If he trespasses, we could obtain...

650
00:43:00.531 --> 00:43:03.500
evidence with his DNA.

651
00:43:03.834 --> 00:43:05.870
Ms. Hong and I will be outside the house.

652
00:43:06.537 --> 00:43:10.174
Sun Woo, don't forget to keep the radio connected.

653
00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:14.378
Sun Woo, are you all right with this?

654
00:43:15.212 --> 00:43:16.213
Of course.

655
00:43:16.213 --> 00:43:17.982
Be careful.

656
00:43:22.186 --> 00:43:23.721
You don't need to worry.

657
00:43:37.001 --> 00:43:38.335
(Happy Finding)

658
00:44:31.922 --> 00:44:32.990
All right.

659
00:44:35.092 --> 00:44:36.226
Keep watching.

660
00:45:18.302 --> 00:45:20.004
The culprit has access...

661
00:45:20.004 --> 00:45:22.473
to not only the victims but to everyone.

662
00:45:22.473 --> 00:45:25.576
He was in charge of the research for the freshmen's orientation.

663
00:45:25.576 --> 00:45:28.612
The culprit was used to the structure of the victim's houses.

664
00:45:29.446 --> 00:45:32.816
He cut off the electricity and went through the door he had opened.

665
00:45:33.517 --> 00:45:35.919
Do you think that could have anything to do with his job?

666
00:45:38.555 --> 00:45:41.058
He has a job that allows him...

667
00:45:42.693 --> 00:45:44.628
to watch the victims' houses...

668
00:45:45.496 --> 00:45:47.197
without suspicion...

669
00:45:47.998 --> 00:45:50.634
and to obtain information...

670
00:45:51.335 --> 00:45:53.237
from a research company.

671
00:46:31.575 --> 00:46:32.576
Get ready.

672
00:46:33.577 --> 00:46:37.347
Find out if there's anyone who works as the building maintenance...

673
00:46:37.915 --> 00:46:41.085
of research company's building was involved in these past cases.

674
00:47:03.273 --> 00:47:05.442
His name is Kim Hyung Soo, and he is 35 years old.

675
00:47:05.442 --> 00:47:09.213
He worked as a security guard at Happy Finding.

676
00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:13.117
He was booked without detention for a short while...

677
00:47:13.117 --> 00:47:15.752
for assaulting his girlfriend.

678
00:47:16.286 --> 00:47:19.490
Six years ago, he lived with his girlfriend named Hannah.

679
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:22.392
After the assault, she moved out right away.

680
00:47:22.392 --> 00:47:24.394
About a year ago, she married someone else...

681
00:47:24.394 --> 00:47:26.130
and moved out of the country.

682
00:47:26.263 --> 00:47:30.367
His ex-girlfriend's marriage stimulated Kim Hyung Soo's trauma.

683
00:47:30.467 --> 00:47:32.469
Yes, I believe that's what happened.

684
00:47:32.903 --> 00:47:35.239
Hannah registered her marriage...

685
00:47:35.305 --> 00:47:38.642
just a week before the first sexual assault.

686
00:47:38.976 --> 00:47:40.043
I need you to check...

687
00:47:40.043 --> 00:47:43.313
if the same security car was seen around the victims.

688
00:48:11.575 --> 00:48:12.576
Let go.

689
00:48:16.213 --> 00:48:18.248
(NCI Kim Hyun Jun)

690
00:48:22.619 --> 00:48:24.354
The number you're calling...

691
00:48:40.737 --> 00:48:41.738
Oh Ju Hwan.

What are you doing?

695
00:48:46.877 --> 00:48:47.878
Hold still.

00:48:48.111 --> 00:48:49.746
- Get him. - Let go!

697
00:48:49.746 --> 00:48:50.747

- Pardon? - The car of the security company...

00:49:14.871 --> 00:49:17.908
was caught on the CCTV cameras surrounding the victims' homes.

Yes, sir.

717
00:50:00.884 --> 00:50:04.087
The culprit works for the research company's security.

718

- Pardon? - The car of the security company...

722
00:50:21.772 --> 00:50:24.474
Sir, Sun Woo isn't here.

723
00:50:24.474 --> 00:50:25.842
Her phone is turned off.

724
00:50:27.244 --> 00:50:28.745
I don't think it's Oh Ju Hwan.

725
00:50:28.979 --> 00:50:31.048
He was calling an illegal massage parlor...

726
00:50:31.048 --> 00:50:32.916
to find its location.

727
00:50:40.857 --> 00:50:43.293
Find out Kim Hyung Soo's address,

728
00:50:43.293 --> 00:50:45.395
and send it to Hyun Jun and the team on ground.

Hannah.

731
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.285
How can you do this to me?

732
00:51:08.285 --> 00:51:09.386
Move.

733
00:51:12.055 --> 00:51:14.224
I don't have your baby anymore,

734
00:51:15.025 --> 00:51:16.393
so I won't ever have to see you again.

735
00:51:16.393 --> 00:51:17.394
What?

736
00:51:17.627 --> 00:51:19.062
Did you think...

737
00:51:19.696 --> 00:51:21.098
I'd marry...

738
00:51:21.098 --> 00:51:23.467
a poor man without a future...

739
00:51:23.667 --> 00:51:25.435
who always hits me?

740
00:51:28.138 --> 00:51:30.073
I'd rather die alone...

741
00:51:30.073 --> 00:51:32.709
than raise a child that looks you.

742
00:51:33.443 --> 00:51:34.478
Don't you dare...

743
00:51:35.746 --> 00:51:37.647
touch me anymore.

744
00:51:50.227 --> 00:51:51.228
Let go!

745
00:51:58.502 --> 00:51:59.836
Fine, kill me.

746
00:51:59.936 --> 00:52:01.104
Kill me!

747
00:52:01.104 --> 00:52:03.507
- Just kill me instead! - What are you doing?

748
00:52:03.507 --> 00:52:04.674
Hey!

749
00:52:12.015 --> 00:52:13.683
Kim Hyung Soo, Ha Sun Woo.

750
00:52:14.384 --> 00:52:16.086
Where are you?

751
00:52:50.954 --> 00:52:52.189
Where do you think he went?

752
00:52:53.957 --> 00:52:54.958
Yes.

753
00:52:55.592 --> 00:52:57.994
I need you to check if Hyung Soo and Hannah...

754
00:52:57.994 --> 00:53:00.897
had a place registered as home together before.

755
00:53:00.897 --> 00:53:02.666
After that, track for the vehicle nearby.

756
00:53:02.899 --> 00:53:03.900
Okay.

757
00:53:11.842 --> 00:53:14.311
I found Kim Hyung Soo's car.

758
00:53:15.912 --> 00:53:17.948
In 2011, Kim Hyung Soo and Hannah...

759
00:53:17.948 --> 00:53:20.016
registered for the same house.

760
00:53:20.016 --> 00:53:21.251
This is the address.

761
00:53:21.785 --> 00:53:23.920
The area is under redevelopment right now.

762
00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.522
It's currently vacant.

763
00:53:45.876 --> 00:53:47.310
Were you waiting...

764
00:53:47.477 --> 00:53:49.379
to catch me there?

765
00:53:55.485 --> 00:53:56.486
Are you looking for this?

766
00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.355
You're just a weak woman...

767
00:53:58.788 --> 00:54:00.156
without this.

768
00:54:00.824 --> 00:54:01.825
That's who you are.

769
00:54:02.292 --> 00:54:03.360
Kim Hyung Soo.

770
00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.496
Is this how you treat women?

771
00:54:06.496 --> 00:54:08.098
NCI agent...

772
00:54:09.232 --> 00:54:10.901
isn't much different.

773
00:54:11.234 --> 00:54:12.836
What would you know?

774
00:54:14.738 --> 00:54:17.407
You must not know me.

775
00:54:17.607 --> 00:54:18.742
Once you get to know me,

776
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:21.144
you'll change your mind.

777
00:54:22.345 --> 00:54:24.414
If you realize how much they wanted me...

778
00:54:24.414 --> 00:54:26.316
and liked me,

779
00:54:28.285 --> 00:54:32.088
you'll be dying to have my child.

780
00:54:32.589 --> 00:54:33.590
No.

781
00:54:33.924 --> 00:54:35.892
I know very well how people like you are.

782
00:54:36.192 --> 00:54:38.962
You never dated a woman properly.

783
00:54:39.496 --> 00:54:41.898
All you do is try to overpower them.

784
00:54:43.133 --> 00:54:44.501
If you don't treat them harshly,

785
00:54:44.501 --> 00:54:47.604
you can't even feel anything. You're a perverted sadist.

786
00:54:48.204 --> 00:54:49.606
That's what you are.

787
00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.842
You were probably just as horrible when you were young.

788
00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:56.146
Someone with a proper past...

789
00:54:56.746 --> 00:54:58.715
wouldn't treat women like you.

790
00:55:01.351 --> 00:55:04.654
So you know me well, don't you?

791
00:55:06.122 --> 00:55:08.291
Shall we check?

792
00:55:09.326 --> 00:55:12.295
Let's see how different you are compared to other women.

793
00:55:16.232 --> 00:55:18.535
How does it feel? Does it feel real now?

794
00:55:19.169 --> 00:55:20.470
Shall we check?

795
00:55:22.405 --> 00:55:24.941
No woman has ever looked at me like you do.

796
00:55:25.475 --> 00:55:26.610
It excites me.

797
00:55:28.044 --> 00:55:29.112
Stay still!

798
00:55:30.213 --> 00:55:32.048
You'll feel good soon.

799
00:55:33.917 --> 00:55:35.251
I said, stay still.

800
00:55:35.251 --> 00:55:37.053
I told you, you'll feel great.

801
00:55:57.774 --> 00:55:59.275
Let me ask you one thing.

802
00:56:01.211 --> 00:56:04.047
Why does someone like you want a child?

803
00:56:04.047 --> 00:56:05.115
See?

804
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:09.653
You also want to know me, don't you?

805
00:56:10.286 --> 00:56:11.921
You like it, but you act like you don't.

806
00:56:12.922 --> 00:56:14.591
You act clean, but you're dirty.

807
00:56:15.358 --> 00:56:17.127
You pretend to be chaste when you're not.

808
00:56:17.127 --> 00:56:18.495
Come here.

809
00:56:18.495 --> 00:56:20.130
- No. - Follow me.

810
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:21.498
No.

811
00:56:22.198 --> 00:56:23.266
Go in.

812
00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.670
Don't cry. Stay quiet in there.

813
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:29.606
No. I don't want to.

814
00:56:29.606 --> 00:56:30.740
Mommy.

815
00:56:32.042 --> 00:56:33.510
Stop it.

816
00:56:34.778 --> 00:56:36.312
That's what women are like.

817
00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:39.849
I only served those women.

818
00:56:40.684 --> 00:56:42.185
I'm only trying to...

819
00:56:43.453 --> 00:56:46.189
make them have a baby like me.

820
00:56:48.124 --> 00:56:50.760
Hey, what are you doing?

821
00:56:51.528 --> 00:56:53.063
We should start it over.

822
00:56:55.632 --> 00:56:56.633
My kid.

823
00:57:01.738 --> 00:57:02.772
Stop.

824
00:57:02.872 --> 00:57:05.742
What? You enjoyed it too.

825
00:57:07.944 --> 00:57:09.145
Is this what you want?

826
00:57:11.247 --> 00:57:14.884
Do you want to end up like the ones on TV or...

827
00:57:54.858 --> 00:57:58.561
"Tragedy is a tool for the living to gain wisdom,"

828
00:57:58.928 --> 00:58:02.165
"not a guide by which to live."

829
00:58:02.732 --> 00:58:03.967
Robert Kennedy.
