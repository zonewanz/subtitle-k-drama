1
00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:19.498
Make way.

2
00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:24.338
(Episode 1)

3
00:00:25.277 --> 00:00:26.277
Move.

4
00:00:27.308 --> 00:00:28.847
Make way.

5
00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:42.458
Stop.

6
00:00:53.197 --> 00:00:54.208
Gosh.

7
00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:12.558
Goodness. Are you okay?

8
00:01:12.558 --> 00:01:13.627
Oh, my.

9
00:01:13.627 --> 00:01:14.787
Mr. Kim!

10
00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:17.698
Let's not meet ever again.

11
00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:19.558
Oh, my.

12
00:01:27.138 --> 00:01:28.508
- Oh, my. - Are you okay?

13
00:01:28.508 --> 00:01:29.668
Are you okay?

14
00:01:29.668 --> 00:01:32.278
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:49.758 --> 00:01:50.998
My shoulders hurt.

16
00:01:50.998 --> 00:01:52.198
Take this arm.

17
00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:54.927
Where do you think you're going? You need to pay me.

18
00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:56.397
Do I owe you?

19
00:01:56.397 --> 00:01:58.437
Cut the nonsense and pay me right now.

20
00:01:58.437 --> 00:01:59.897
If not, I'm going to follow you to your company.

21
00:01:59.897 --> 00:02:02.108
How will you take away my precious money?

22
00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:03.308
How?

23
00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:04.808
Look.

24
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:07.308
I'll deal with it according to the law.

25
00:02:07.308 --> 00:02:09.247
(Petition for back pay)

26
00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:11.578
(Petitioner, Baek June)

27
00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:21.828
She's like a leech.

28
00:02:21.828 --> 00:02:24.198
You're a dracula that sucks the blood from part-timers.

29
00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:30.568
Disappear from my life after this.

30
00:02:33.068 --> 00:02:34.568
This is still my money.

31
00:02:40.478 --> 00:02:41.878
Don't look down on your part-timers,

32
00:02:41.878 --> 00:02:43.677
and don't try to bilk money from them.

33
00:02:43.677 --> 00:02:45.777
Live an honest life, Mr. Kim.

34
00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:53.927
Here.

35
00:02:55.087 --> 00:02:57.057
- What is this? - Your change.

36
00:02:57.158 --> 00:02:58.658
I'm a calculative person.

37
00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:15.908
I'm late.

38
00:03:18.747 --> 00:03:20.047
I'm Baek June.

39
00:03:20.418 --> 00:03:23.858
I'm the perfect alpha girl for the 21st century of Korea.

40
00:03:24.017 --> 00:03:25.888
No, I'm just a part-timer.

41
00:03:26.117 --> 00:03:28.258
Can I have two cups of lattes?

42
00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:30.557
Yes, do you want them hot?

43
00:03:33.027 --> 00:03:34.027
Thank you.

44
00:03:35.997 --> 00:03:37.698
Part-time jobs are also jobs.

45
00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:39.897
You can earn as much as regular jobs...

46
00:03:39.897 --> 00:03:41.908
if you work at three good part-time jobs.

47
00:03:44.237 --> 00:03:45.737
People say that you should get...

48
00:03:45.737 --> 00:03:47.707
a stable job when you're younger.

49
00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:50.008
Do they know that people spend...

50
00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:52.348
thousands of dollar each year to acquire...

51
00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:53.547
requirements for jobs?

52
00:03:56.188 --> 00:03:58.158
- Here. - Okay.

53
00:03:58.158 --> 00:03:59.158
Okay.

54
00:03:59.957 --> 00:04:02.457
- Thank you. - Have a drink.

55
00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:03.957
Just give me half a cup.

56
00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:05.828
Drink up.

57
00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:06.828
Okay.

58
00:04:09.828 --> 00:04:12.797
Drink some more. It's like an energy drink.

59
00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:15.038
I can't be drunk for my next schedule.

60
00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:17.678
How many part-time jobs are you working per day?

61
00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:20.477
You graduated from college. Why are you living like that?

62
00:04:20.477 --> 00:04:23.618
I think investing time and money to get a job is useless.

63
00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:26.748
You're right. Everyone is a college graduate these days.

64
00:04:26.748 --> 00:04:28.248
They all get fired when they turn 40 years old...

65
00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:29.717
no matter how hard they try.

66
00:04:29.717 --> 00:04:31.157
I was fired at 39.

67
00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:35.328
The first country is Switzerland.

68
00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:37.597
This is Mr. Kim from M Electronics.

69
00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:43.068
I was a big player from Yeouido.

70
00:04:43.068 --> 00:04:45.438
Mr. Lee used to work at L Securities.

71
00:04:45.438 --> 00:04:47.107
People treated Mrs. Ahn well in Gangnam...

72
00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:49.467
before her husband's business collapsed.

73
00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:52.178
We need to golf together some time.

74
00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:55.347
A stable job in Korea has become...

75
00:04:55.347 --> 00:04:57.217
a fantasy since a long time ago.

76
00:04:59.378 --> 00:05:02.017
I know a person who went through restructuring.

77
00:05:02.017 --> 00:05:03.988
He opened a chicken restaurant and a convenience store...

78
00:05:03.988 --> 00:05:05.717
and died from a brain hemorrhage.

79
00:05:27.808 --> 00:05:31.748
That's why I chose a path that was fast and durable.

80
00:05:32.847 --> 00:05:35.888
(Human management, Walking the right path)

81
00:05:35.888 --> 00:05:40.488
(Byun Gang Soo, Chairman of Gangsoo Group)

82
00:05:48.928 --> 00:05:50.298
You're here.

83
00:05:51.337 --> 00:05:52.337
- It's been a long time. - Hello.

84
00:05:52.337 --> 00:05:53.568
Chairman Byun.

85
00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:54.907
You're here.

86
00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:57.808
Thank you for making time for us.

87
00:05:57.808 --> 00:05:58.808
Congratulations.

88
00:05:58.808 --> 00:05:59.977
Yes, thank you.

89
00:05:59.977 --> 00:06:01.308
How have you been?

90
00:06:01.308 --> 00:06:02.777
Good. How about you?

91
00:06:02.777 --> 00:06:04.347
Thanks to you, I'm doing good.

92
00:06:05.618 --> 00:06:06.717
You're beautiful tonight.

93
00:06:06.717 --> 00:06:07.917
Thank you.

94
00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:10.558
Would you like some champagne?

95
00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:11.558
Please.

96
00:06:13.428 --> 00:06:14.457
Again, congratulations.

97
00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.328
- Thank you. - Thank you.

98
00:06:25.368 --> 00:06:26.467
This way.

99
00:06:32.938 --> 00:06:34.147
Do you want a drink?

100
00:06:36.107 --> 00:06:37.248
I'm working.

101
00:06:37.248 --> 00:06:39.048
He says, "Human management".

102
00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:40.818
Your chairman is so strict.

103
00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:43.217
He should allow his employees to enjoy events like this.

104
00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:47.388
When did you get employed at the hotel?

105
00:06:47.388 --> 00:06:48.587
It's a part time job.

106
00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:50.527
When are you going to stop working part time?

107
00:06:50.798 --> 00:06:52.157
What's wrong with working part time?

108
00:06:53.128 --> 00:06:55.198
While you, a full-time employee at Gangsoo,

109
00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:57.767
have to stand up straight all day and can't even get a drink of water,

110
00:06:57.798 --> 00:06:59.638
I can eat whenever I want.

111
00:07:00.568 --> 00:07:01.967
The caviar tastes so nice today.

112
00:07:07.048 --> 00:07:10.248
The lack of responsibility is what differentiates a professional.

113
00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:13.248
Where is the chairman's son that you are taking care of?

114
00:07:13.448 --> 00:07:16.188
I want to see a rich man's son for myself.

115
00:07:16.347 --> 00:07:18.188
Don't mind that and just do your work.

116
00:07:18.517 --> 00:07:19.618
Sure.

117
00:07:36.777 --> 00:07:39.078
Hello? Where are you?

118
00:07:39.078 --> 00:07:41.748
My friend. My friend.

119
00:07:42.647 --> 00:07:44.548
My friend. My friend.

120
00:07:44.717 --> 00:07:46.347
My friend.

121
00:07:46.748 --> 00:07:48.087
Je Hoon.

122
00:07:48.587 --> 00:07:50.017
My friend.

123
00:07:50.488 --> 00:07:53.628
My friend. My friend.

124
00:07:54.527 --> 00:07:55.828
Is everything okay?

125
00:07:56.657 --> 00:07:58.628
Chae Ri didn't come.

126
00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:06.097
We were supposed to meet in Bali.

127
00:08:06.597 --> 00:08:09.508
But she ignored my texts and didn't even call me.

128
00:08:13.448 --> 00:08:16.207
My friend. Where are you?

129
00:08:17.878 --> 00:08:19.948
Are you the only one on this plane?

130
00:08:26.318 --> 00:08:27.688
Excuse me, sir.

131
00:08:27.787 --> 00:08:31.227
If you're done, please return the telephone.

132
00:08:31.727 --> 00:08:34.727
I still miss Chae Ri, Je Hoon.

133
00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:37.938
What should I do now?

134
00:08:38.867 --> 00:08:40.467
Chae Ri.

135
00:08:41.107 --> 00:08:43.707
Are you drunk? Where are you?

136
00:08:43.977 --> 00:08:45.438
Chae Ri.

137
00:08:45.877 --> 00:08:47.148
Excuse me.

138
00:08:48.107 --> 00:08:49.347
Excuse me.

139
00:08:51.217 --> 00:08:53.948
This is Hankook Airways flight from Bali to Incheon.

140
00:08:54.247 --> 00:08:56.818
The other passengers are complaining about the phone call.

141
00:08:57.058 --> 00:08:58.757
Would it be all right if I hang up?

142
00:08:59.387 --> 00:09:00.928
Thank you.

143
00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:07.127
Please sit down.

144
00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:08.768
I'm already sitting down.

145
00:09:08.768 --> 00:09:10.798
Not there. Down here.

146
00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:15.337
Chae Ri.

147
00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:25.678
Can I have one more drink?

148
00:09:25.977 --> 00:09:27.587
Please, I beg you.

149
00:09:29.117 --> 00:09:32.288
I'm afraid it's not going to be possible due to company regulations.

150
00:09:32.587 --> 00:09:35.158
Everyone. Everyone. This airline...

151
00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:36.457
has a really bad service.

152
00:09:36.457 --> 00:09:37.957
- Where's the way out? - Wait.

153
00:09:37.957 --> 00:09:40.467
- Where's the way out? - You shouldn't stand up right now.

154
00:10:04.558 --> 00:10:05.717
Sit down this instant.

155
00:10:05.857 --> 00:10:07.087
Let me go.

156
00:10:07.928 --> 00:10:09.028
Gosh.

157
00:10:09.028 --> 00:10:10.928
- Why are you trying to... - Oh, my.

158
00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:14.268
I'm going to shoot this taser gun.

159
00:10:22.967 --> 00:10:24.337
Chae Ri...

160
00:10:30.377 --> 00:10:31.818
You're really funny.

161
00:10:34.918 --> 00:10:36.188
Thank you for coming.

162
00:10:37.818 --> 00:10:40.558
Your eldest son always looks handsome.

163
00:10:40.987 --> 00:10:42.158
Thank you.

164
00:10:42.627 --> 00:10:44.798
Where's your younger son?

165
00:10:45.398 --> 00:10:47.068
He's on his way.

166
00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:50.298
He has a severe cold. He won't be coming here.

167
00:10:50.837 --> 00:10:52.698
- Why... - Did he do something wrong again?

168
00:10:52.768 --> 00:10:54.438
Stop.

169
00:10:57.408 --> 00:10:58.678
Excuse me, Father.

170
00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:19.698
You know I'm aerophobic.

171
00:11:20.497 --> 00:11:22.597
It's so scary when the airplane shakes.

172
00:11:23.168 --> 00:11:25.737
To explain everything, as soon as I stood up,

173
00:11:25.798 --> 00:11:27.538
the airplane shook really bad.

174
00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:30.007
You know how when you're in an unexpected situation,

175
00:11:30.007 --> 00:11:31.678
you try to hold on to something, right?

176
00:11:31.678 --> 00:11:33.578
That's why you held on to the stewardess's breasts?

177
00:11:33.578 --> 00:11:35.048
Yes.

178
00:11:42.548 --> 00:11:45.957
I was so scared that the airplane would fall at any minute.

179
00:11:47.188 --> 00:11:48.627
Can't you understand me?

180
00:11:49.587 --> 00:11:51.398
It wasn't sexual harassment.

181
00:11:53.898 --> 00:11:56.127
My management philosophy has always been...

182
00:11:56.127 --> 00:11:57.298
based on...

183
00:11:58.467 --> 00:11:59.837
the people.

184
00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.477
People based management...

185
00:12:03.707 --> 00:12:06.908
is the most important virtue and value...

186
00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:10.818
in the fourth industrial revolution...

187
00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:13.048
of the 21st century.

188
00:12:16.418 --> 00:12:20.288
That's the road that Gangsoo Group is headed...

189
00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:22.487
and its goal.

190
00:12:25.198 --> 00:12:26.627
I, Byun Gang Soo,

191
00:12:26.867 --> 00:12:29.028
will try to continue the former chairman's goals...

192
00:12:29.367 --> 00:12:30.698
and make Gangsoo Group...

193
00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:34.507
succeed proudly in the global market...

194
00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:37.607
as the company that leads the economic development...

195
00:12:38.938 --> 00:12:40.408
of Korea.

196
00:13:08.837 --> 00:13:09.967
Hey.

197
00:13:21.418 --> 00:13:22.518
Let's go.

198
00:13:36.938 --> 00:13:38.068
Wait.

199
00:13:40.467 --> 00:13:41.538
Okay.

200
00:13:42.168 --> 00:13:43.408
Your hair.

201
00:13:44.237 --> 00:13:45.737
- Is this okay? - Yes.

202
00:13:46.637 --> 00:13:49.078
You scumbag!

203
00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:51.648
I'm sorry. Please calm down and listen to me.

204
00:13:52.578 --> 00:13:55.018
What excuse are you going to make up...

205
00:13:55.018 --> 00:13:57.087
this time, scumbag?

206
00:13:58.318 --> 00:14:00.627
It wasn't like that. I didn't do it on purpose.

207
00:14:00.627 --> 00:14:03.087
Come here. Come here. Come here right now!

208
00:14:03.597 --> 00:14:06.158
You jerk! How did I end up with a scumbag like this?

209
00:14:07.997 --> 00:14:11.467
I'm sorry. It's my fault I gave birth to such a lacking son.

210
00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:12.698
You're blaming yourself again.

211
00:14:12.698 --> 00:14:14.938
I told you so many times. I came out early because I was in a hurry.

212
00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:19.377
If you had been born after seven months and made your mom suffer,

213
00:14:19.737 --> 00:14:22.408
you should get a hold of yourself and start acting like a human.

214
00:14:22.408 --> 00:14:24.247
Father, your blood pressure.

215
00:14:24.247 --> 00:14:26.887
My blood pressure? Before you worry about my blood pressure,

216
00:14:27.548 --> 00:14:29.987
you should worry about your legs first.

217
00:14:34.627 --> 00:14:36.357
Chairman Byun, I brought this.

218
00:14:36.587 --> 00:14:38.227
If you only use violence,

219
00:14:38.227 --> 00:14:39.627
there won't be any communication between us.

220
00:14:39.627 --> 00:14:41.398
What? Communication?

221
00:14:41.398 --> 00:14:45.298
Hyuk, just beg him for forgiveness.

222
00:14:45.298 --> 00:14:47.607
Why do you get angry even before you hear me out?

223
00:14:47.607 --> 00:14:49.408
Manager Kwon, get down.

224
00:14:49.408 --> 00:14:50.908
- Father. - Yes, Chairman Byun.

225
00:14:51.007 --> 00:14:52.977
No, Je Hoon did nothing wrong.

226
00:14:53.038 --> 00:14:55.007
He made a mistake of letting...

227
00:14:55.107 --> 00:14:57.078
a time bomb get onto a plane by himself.

228
00:14:57.078 --> 00:14:58.847
I lied to him to get onto the plane.

229
00:15:00.318 --> 00:15:03.148
You scums. You're just the same.

230
00:15:03.387 --> 00:15:06.357
Don't you have things to do that are worth doing?

231
00:15:06.887 --> 00:15:08.028
Father.

232
00:15:11.757 --> 00:15:13.198
I'm sorry, Father.

233
00:15:14.467 --> 00:15:15.997
It's all my fault.

234
00:15:17.198 --> 00:15:18.438
If you are going to hit someone,

235
00:15:19.497 --> 00:15:20.768
hit me.

236
00:15:25.607 --> 00:15:30.048
Don't let me see him again for a while.

237
00:15:37.288 --> 00:15:38.857
Thank you, Manager Kwon.

238
00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:54.967
Stand up.

239
00:15:55.507 --> 00:15:57.507
Why won't my father...

240
00:15:58.007 --> 00:16:00.347
ever listen to me?

241
00:16:02.148 --> 00:16:03.778
I have my reasons.

242
00:16:05.217 --> 00:16:06.578
He just gets angry at me...

243
00:16:07.617 --> 00:16:09.117
to vent out his anger.

244
00:16:10.918 --> 00:16:11.957
Well,

245
00:16:12.857 --> 00:16:14.387
I must obey him.

246
00:16:15.227 --> 00:16:16.528
He's the king.

247
00:16:16.528 --> 00:16:19.227
Just know that you have your privileges thanks to him...

248
00:16:19.497 --> 00:16:20.997
before you complain.

249
00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:26.867
Maybe.

250
00:16:28.137 --> 00:16:29.408
Thank you.

251
00:16:29.408 --> 00:16:30.808
- Thank you. - Thank you.

252
00:16:34.847 --> 00:16:37.318
Can you clean this up by yourself?

253
00:16:37.318 --> 00:16:40.018
Of course. This is the least I can do to earn more.

254
00:16:40.318 --> 00:16:41.518
You should go.

255
00:16:41.818 --> 00:16:43.987
Well, you're good at your job.

256
00:16:44.688 --> 00:16:45.788
I'll leave the rest up to you.

257
00:16:45.788 --> 00:16:47.457
Bye, thank you.

258
00:16:47.457 --> 00:16:48.457
Bye.

259
00:19:28.087 --> 00:19:29.718
I'm home.

260
00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:50.238
Hello. Good morning.

261
00:19:50.238 --> 00:19:51.708
I think your body needs this.

262
00:19:52.407 --> 00:19:53.708
How are you?

263
00:19:54.147 --> 00:19:55.407
You have dark circles under your eyes.

264
00:19:55.407 --> 00:19:58.248
It'll get better if you drink this. Feel free to take this free sample.

265
00:19:58.248 --> 00:19:59.447
Thank you.

266
00:19:59.617 --> 00:20:01.748
Hello. Good morning.

267
00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:12.657
Hello. Good morning.

268
00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:15.968
Manager Kwon!

269
00:20:16.367 --> 00:20:17.968
When did you get promoted?

270
00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:19.498
I said I'm not drinking it.

271
00:20:19.498 --> 00:20:22.337
Please take it as you got promoted.

272
00:20:24.377 --> 00:20:26.038
Help me improve my performance.

273
00:20:35.947 --> 00:20:37.218
Let's talk outside for a minute.

274
00:20:39.318 --> 00:20:40.328
Take this.

275
00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.087
What is it?

276
00:20:43.758 --> 00:20:44.758
(Job application)

277
00:20:44.758 --> 00:20:46.228
It's an application form for a new recruit.

278
00:20:46.627 --> 00:20:48.068
Why are you giving this...

279
00:20:48.068 --> 00:20:49.828
You're qualified enough to pass the resume screening...

280
00:20:49.828 --> 00:20:51.738
if I talk to human resources.

281
00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:54.167
You have a reason for delivering vegetable juice here, don't you?

282
00:20:54.167 --> 00:20:56.937
Stop trying to be acquainted with the employees here...

283
00:20:57.308 --> 00:20:59.407
by visiting different departments.

284
00:20:59.677 --> 00:21:02.208
It won't help if you're acknowledged that way.

285
00:21:02.407 --> 00:21:03.978
You'll lose points on your job interview.

286
00:21:07.187 --> 00:21:08.187
Why?

287
00:21:09.248 --> 00:21:11.758
Because delivering vegetable juice is insignificant?

288
00:21:12.417 --> 00:21:13.427
Hey.

289
00:21:13.627 --> 00:21:16.687
People are valued according to what they do.

290
00:21:18.758 --> 00:21:22.927
You're deluding yourself that you're doing something grand.

291
00:21:23.068 --> 00:21:25.897
I don't want to earn money like you by cleaning up after rich people.

292
00:21:26.298 --> 00:21:28.637
Stop standing on your petty pride.

293
00:21:28.808 --> 00:21:30.407
After all, what you're doing now...

294
00:21:30.778 --> 00:21:32.278
also makes money for that company's CEO.

295
00:21:32.278 --> 00:21:33.337
No.

296
00:21:33.447 --> 00:21:36.048
At least, I'm not a fixer for company owner's son.

297
00:21:36.847 --> 00:21:38.417
Right. I haven't seen it these days.

298
00:21:38.518 --> 00:21:40.718
It was fun to see your face on newspapers.

299
00:21:42.248 --> 00:21:43.988
I'm telling you again.

300
00:21:45.087 --> 00:21:46.857
I'm not interested in permanent positions,

301
00:21:46.857 --> 00:21:49.187
especially at the company you're working.

302
00:22:04.578 --> 00:22:05.677
(The younger son of Gangsoo Group found driving while intoxicated)

303
00:22:05.677 --> 00:22:07.578
Byun Hyuk, the younger son of Gangsoo Group.

304
00:22:08.278 --> 00:22:09.478
He's quite famous.

305
00:22:13.818 --> 00:22:15.818
He drives while intoxicated, dine and dash in a club,

306
00:22:15.818 --> 00:22:17.387
and even urinates on the street.

307
00:22:17.818 --> 00:22:19.558
You wrap up the cases roughly,

308
00:22:19.558 --> 00:22:21.857
and you're the one who appears on the media.

309
00:22:22.857 --> 00:22:25.657
Air rage is a serious crime.

310
00:22:25.657 --> 00:22:28.397
It's different from those misdemeanors.

311
00:22:28.397 --> 00:22:29.568
I know that.

312
00:22:31.038 --> 00:22:32.068
Have you eaten yet?

313
00:22:32.167 --> 00:22:33.637
It's still early.

314
00:22:33.968 --> 00:22:35.038
Is it?

315
00:22:35.538 --> 00:22:37.877
It's been so long since I ate on time.

316
00:22:38.208 --> 00:22:39.437
This is how a prosecutor lives.

317
00:22:39.437 --> 00:22:41.708
I can't eat on time or sleep on time.

318
00:22:41.708 --> 00:22:43.548
It's a difficult job.

319
00:22:46.578 --> 00:22:48.687
There's no easy job in the world, you know.

320
00:22:59.857 --> 00:23:02.498
It must be hard for you to clean up after rich people.

321
00:23:03.867 --> 00:23:05.397
I'll consider this matter settled.

322
00:23:05.538 --> 00:23:07.837
I'll get going now.

323
00:23:10.937 --> 00:23:13.907
I thought you would work as my subordinate.

324
00:23:14.278 --> 00:23:15.907
Didn't you prepare for the bar exam?

325
00:23:17.278 --> 00:23:19.978
I was surprised to hear that you entered Gangsoo Group.

326
00:23:20.447 --> 00:23:22.748
You were the top student in your class.

327
00:23:22.847 --> 00:23:24.018
Why are you living like this?

328
00:23:35.798 --> 00:23:37.097
You and I are...

329
00:23:37.397 --> 00:23:38.867
not so different.

330
00:23:39.568 --> 00:23:41.167
We're both salaried employees.

331
00:23:42.667 --> 00:23:45.137
Are you looking down on me for taking bribes?

332
00:23:46.278 --> 00:23:47.447
I understand.

333
00:23:47.978 --> 00:23:50.877
It's hard to reject the order your superior gives.

334
00:23:53.248 --> 00:23:55.718
This is not a bribe. It's a compensation.

335
00:23:55.718 --> 00:23:57.758
Look at you.

336
00:23:57.758 --> 00:24:01.288
I forgot. Call me whenever you find your work hard.

337
00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:03.627
At the legal department I work,

338
00:24:03.627 --> 00:24:05.498
I can make your position available.

339
00:24:11.697 --> 00:24:13.637
You can get an annual salary as much as you want.

340
00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:15.208
Bye.

341
00:24:24.218 --> 00:24:26.447
I met the prosecutor in charge and settled the matter.

342
00:24:27.218 --> 00:24:29.647
It's the original file. There's no copy of it.

343
00:24:31.458 --> 00:24:33.288
Even though he's my brother,

344
00:24:33.387 --> 00:24:36.288
I don't understand at all what he's thinking.

345
00:24:36.758 --> 00:24:39.558
I think he makes mistakes often as he's an emotional person.

346
00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:45.437
Anyway, it was settled quietly thanks to your effort.

347
00:24:46.238 --> 00:24:48.367
I guess he would stay quiet for a while after this.

348
00:24:48.367 --> 00:24:49.468
He should.

349
00:24:51.177 --> 00:24:52.177
Where is he now?

350
00:25:10.998 --> 00:25:13.298
There's no way this is how we're saying goodbye.

351
00:25:14.828 --> 00:25:17.397
There must be an inevitable reason.

352
00:25:17.998 --> 00:25:19.937
We're being out of touch for a short while.

353
00:25:20.637 --> 00:25:21.907
I should not be obsessed with it.

354
00:25:30.347 --> 00:25:32.347
- What are you looking at? - I really didn't look.

355
00:25:32.347 --> 00:25:34.548
- You looked! - You're the prettiest.

356
00:25:34.548 --> 00:25:37.988
- Come on. - I really didn't look.

357
00:25:37.988 --> 00:25:39.917
- You looked. - What's this?

358
00:25:39.917 --> 00:25:41.427
It's nothing.

359
00:25:41.427 --> 00:25:43.728
- Catch me if you can! - What are you doing?

360
00:25:45.728 --> 00:25:46.728
Chae Ri!

361
00:25:48.268 --> 00:25:49.867
It was definitely Chae Ri's voice.

362
00:25:50.097 --> 00:25:51.697
Chae Ri, Chae Ri!

363
00:26:02.607 --> 00:26:04.278
The key!

364
00:26:05.218 --> 00:26:06.218
What do I do?

365
00:26:16.228 --> 00:26:18.427
- Let's go and have fun. - All right.

366
00:26:21.298 --> 00:26:23.697
Chae Ri.

367
00:26:39.048 --> 00:26:40.647
34, 35...

368
00:26:43.117 --> 00:26:44.117
Chae Ri.

369
00:26:45.018 --> 00:26:46.018
Chae Ri.

370
00:26:53.097 --> 00:26:54.127
Chae Ri.

371
00:26:56.897 --> 00:26:58.097
No, he can't go with Chae Ri!

372
00:27:02.768 --> 00:27:05.538
My goodness. My earring! My earring!

373
00:27:06.008 --> 00:27:08.347
Honey, honey!

374
00:27:08.447 --> 00:27:10.778
What's wrong, honey?

375
00:27:27.498 --> 00:27:29.828
You're the only one who's been to this room!

376
00:27:30.697 --> 00:27:34.308
That's true, but you shouldn't accuse me of something like that.

377
00:27:41.647 --> 00:27:45.478
Goodness. You're even so beautiful when you're angry, honey.

378
00:27:45.978 --> 00:27:48.617
That's enough. You might get wrinkles.

379
00:27:49.087 --> 00:27:51.587
It's nothing. I can buy you the same one.

380
00:27:55.558 --> 00:27:58.097
You look so shameless. Who do you think you're lying to?

381
00:28:01.268 --> 00:28:03.738
I've dealt with people like you so many times.

382
00:28:18.278 --> 00:28:19.718
Honey!

383
00:28:20.617 --> 00:28:23.788
Buy me all of these.

384
00:28:23.788 --> 00:28:25.887
Sure. You can have all of them.

385
00:28:25.988 --> 00:28:27.288
Really?

386
00:28:28.728 --> 00:28:31.097
Can I pay by credit card?

387
00:28:31.798 --> 00:28:34.298
- Honey, I want this too. - Sure.

388
00:28:34.328 --> 00:28:35.897
Honey, how about this one?

389
00:28:35.897 --> 00:28:37.298
- Honey. - I'll pay for all of them.

390
00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:39.397
Thank you, honey.

391
00:28:43.038 --> 00:28:45.538
Congratulations on 30 days of dating...

392
00:28:45.538 --> 00:28:47.778
for Byun Hyuk and Hong Chae Ri!

393
00:28:47.778 --> 00:28:48.907
Everybody, scream!

394
00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:53.377
All right. Kiss!

395
00:28:53.377 --> 00:28:56.347
- Kiss! - Kiss!

396
00:28:56.347 --> 00:28:58.988
- Kiss him now! - Kiss!

397
00:29:02.288 --> 00:29:03.627
I'm so jealous!

398
00:29:03.758 --> 00:29:05.897
Honey, you can go to Bali first.

399
00:29:05.897 --> 00:29:08.468
I'll be there too really soon. All right?

400
00:29:13.238 --> 00:29:16.337
If you didn't take it, where would it be?

401
00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:18.238
You're the only one who cleaned in this room.

402
00:29:19.008 --> 00:29:21.347
I just did my duty.

403
00:29:21.347 --> 00:29:23.407
I haven't seen a trash that looks like it.

404
00:29:23.778 --> 00:29:26.018
So, if you want to treat me like I am a thief,

405
00:29:28.048 --> 00:29:30.048
you need to provide a proper evidence.

406
00:29:31.288 --> 00:29:35.087
It's suspicious that a young person is doing this kind of work.

407
00:29:35.087 --> 00:29:37.427
Haven't you been going after guests' valuables this way?

408
00:29:37.427 --> 00:29:38.958
What did you just say?

409
00:29:39.627 --> 00:29:41.397
How dare you talk to me that way?

410
00:29:44.197 --> 00:29:45.367
You're really...

411
00:29:47.538 --> 00:29:49.568
- You can't do this! - Honey!

412
00:29:49.768 --> 00:29:51.078
What are you doing now?

413
00:29:51.078 --> 00:29:53.748
- Stop right there! - Apologize to her now!

414
00:29:53.748 --> 00:29:56.818
She grabbed me first. Tell someone who grabbed first to apologize!

415
00:29:56.818 --> 00:29:59.117
Baek June, let her go!

416
00:30:03.248 --> 00:30:05.157
Why are you telling me to apologize? Why?

417
00:30:07.728 --> 00:30:08.828
Because she's our customer.

418
00:30:15.167 --> 00:30:16.897
I'm sorry to have made you worry.

419
00:30:16.998 --> 00:30:20.068
I'll find what you have lost as soon as I can.

420
00:30:20.607 --> 00:30:23.008
If I can't find it, I'll compensate for your damage.

421
00:30:24.078 --> 00:30:28.377
Before that, I need to receive an apology from a rude employee.

422
00:30:29.877 --> 00:30:31.278
What are you doing, Ms. Baek?

423
00:30:31.718 --> 00:30:33.147
You should apologize right now.

424
00:30:34.347 --> 00:30:35.617
Baek June!

425
00:30:35.617 --> 00:30:38.587
Gosh, seriously...

426
00:30:59.238 --> 00:31:00.907
Goodness, you crazy!

427
00:31:01.447 --> 00:31:03.917
Yes, I'm the crazy one here.

428
00:31:04.078 --> 00:31:07.387
I'll end up paying for a diamond I haven't touched if I can't find it.

429
00:31:07.387 --> 00:31:09.318
That's enough to drive me crazy, isn't it?

430
00:31:09.587 --> 00:31:11.818
Baek June, stop it now!

431
00:31:11.818 --> 00:31:13.187
You told me to find it!

432
00:31:13.488 --> 00:31:16.587
An employee should first understand when a customer gets upset.

433
00:31:16.758 --> 00:31:18.397
Didn't you hear me when I said you should apologize?

434
00:31:18.728 --> 00:31:20.867
I didn't do anything wrong. Why do I have to apologize?

435
00:31:20.867 --> 00:31:23.397
The customer is always right.

436
00:31:27.167 --> 00:31:28.437
Gosh. Seriously...

437
00:31:32.877 --> 00:31:34.578
Well...

438
00:31:44.187 --> 00:31:46.157
Oh, my foot!

439
00:31:48.657 --> 00:31:49.657
What's this?

440
00:31:58.681 --> 00:32:01.913
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E01 Revolutionary Love ""</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

441
00:32:10.877 --> 00:32:12.278
My earring!

442
00:32:15.117 --> 00:32:16.318
My earring!

443
00:32:18.018 --> 00:32:19.417
Put your foot away!

444
00:32:19.687 --> 00:32:21.657
This customer is not right at all.

445
00:32:21.988 --> 00:32:24.028
An apology should be made by someone who did wrong.

446
00:32:24.597 --> 00:32:26.968
Hey, rude punk. Apologize to me.

447
00:32:27.367 --> 00:32:29.697
I'll put my foot away if you apologize.

448
00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:33.708
- She's incredible. - You lunatic!

449
00:32:40.708 --> 00:32:42.078
I'm sorry, ma'am.

450
00:32:51.458 --> 00:32:52.518
Hey.

451
00:32:53.387 --> 00:32:55.058
You're not a match for me.

452
00:32:56.458 --> 00:32:59.458
I can sue you for making a false accusation.

453
00:33:00.427 --> 00:33:02.697
But that's just wasting revenue stamp on the paper, so I won't.

454
00:33:09.468 --> 00:33:11.978
I'm sorry. I sincerely apologize.

455
00:33:14.278 --> 00:33:15.548
Hey, Ms. Baek!

456
00:33:17.718 --> 00:33:19.177
This is so annoying!

457
00:33:26.657 --> 00:33:28.587
Honey?

458
00:33:33.568 --> 00:33:35.068
Honey.

459
00:33:36.837 --> 00:33:38.738
Honey, honey!

460
00:33:38.768 --> 00:33:41.667
No, no!

461
00:33:41.667 --> 00:33:44.078
It's annoying, so annoying!

462
00:33:45.708 --> 00:33:48.078
After losing love, I write.

463
00:33:48.748 --> 00:33:50.447
- Honey! - Good bye,

464
00:33:50.718 --> 00:33:52.377
short nights.

465
00:33:53.587 --> 00:33:54.748
Good bye,

466
00:33:55.117 --> 00:33:58.917
desires that are not mine any more.

467
00:34:05.162 --> 00:34:07.532
Even though you're a part timer,

468
00:34:07.532 --> 00:34:09.873
you don't have basic manners as an employee here.

469
00:34:09.873 --> 00:34:12.802
An employee should provide work and get paid accordingly.

470
00:34:12.802 --> 00:34:14.072
Do I have to give up being respected?

471
00:34:14.072 --> 00:34:16.313
Money equals respect, at least here.

472
00:34:16.612 --> 00:34:20.153
The salary you receive comes out of the customer's wallet.

473
00:34:21.682 --> 00:34:23.083
That's not right.

474
00:34:25.383 --> 00:34:27.492
If I have to give up being respected and sacrifice my emotions,

475
00:34:27.492 --> 00:34:29.923
the minimum wage of 6.5 dollars per hour is too little.

476
00:34:29.923 --> 00:34:32.063
If you're not satisfied with your pay, you should quit.

477
00:34:32.623 --> 00:34:33.762
How can you say that?

478
00:34:35.762 --> 00:34:38.003
She did nothing wrong. Can you just fire her like that?

479
00:34:43.133 --> 00:34:46.673
Stay quiet for a while and don't cause any trouble, understand?

480
00:34:48.313 --> 00:34:52.083
Anyway, she was treated as if she were a thief. Don't you think...

481
00:34:52.983 --> 00:34:54.813
this is unfair?

482
00:34:56.952 --> 00:34:59.483
What...

483
00:34:59.483 --> 00:35:03.353
Are those in charge of training doing their jobs at all?

484
00:35:04.463 --> 00:35:07.592
That's enough. Calculate my work days after last month,

485
00:35:07.592 --> 00:35:09.592
and send the money to my account today.

486
00:35:09.932 --> 00:35:11.202
The customer is right?

487
00:35:11.463 --> 00:35:14.202
Even the president gets brought down for doing something wrong.

488
00:35:14.202 --> 00:35:15.802
It's not the Restoration period!

489
00:35:15.802 --> 00:35:18.403
I agree. The customer is right?

490
00:35:18.673 --> 00:35:20.142
Her way of thinking is too old-fashioned.

491
00:35:24.412 --> 00:35:28.153
Get out. Both of you, get out now.

492
00:35:31.552 --> 00:35:32.653
Well?

493
00:35:32.753 --> 00:35:33.892
Get out now.

494
00:35:34.092 --> 00:35:35.623
I can walk out.

495
00:35:36.123 --> 00:35:37.592
I have legs too.

496
00:35:37.592 --> 00:35:38.662
Shut it!

497
00:35:42.333 --> 00:35:43.802
This is unfair dismissal.

498
00:35:43.802 --> 00:35:46.463
Is it my fault to ask to treat us as humans?

499
00:35:46.463 --> 00:35:47.972
Unfair what?

500
00:35:47.972 --> 00:35:49.873
I heard that from somewhere.

501
00:35:53.043 --> 00:35:54.373
I can't believe this.

502
00:35:59.512 --> 00:36:02.253
You boast the best service when you treat your employees like this.

503
00:36:02.253 --> 00:36:04.353
I wish your hotel goes out of business.

504
00:36:07.293 --> 00:36:10.362
You don't have to curse because that happened.

505
00:36:10.362 --> 00:36:11.693
What are you doing?

506
00:36:12.023 --> 00:36:13.793
I'm just...

507
00:36:13.793 --> 00:36:15.193
Are you also a part-timer?

508
00:36:15.463 --> 00:36:16.463
- Do you work at the spa? - What?

509
00:36:16.463 --> 00:36:18.032
No, I don't.

510
00:36:18.032 --> 00:36:20.472
Are you a permanent employee?

511
00:36:21.802 --> 00:36:23.432
Did they still fire you like this?

512
00:36:23.432 --> 00:36:26.003
(Permanent employee?)

513
00:36:26.003 --> 00:36:28.673
This hotel is good for nothing.

514
00:36:31.983 --> 00:36:33.883
Just report them to the employment and labor administration.

515
00:36:33.883 --> 00:36:34.883
That's not it.

516
00:36:35.353 --> 00:36:36.612
I don't think that's necessary.

517
00:36:36.612 --> 00:36:38.983
They're acting like this because you just suffer like this.

518
00:36:38.983 --> 00:36:41.793
Report them and make them pay a fine.

519
00:36:41.793 --> 00:36:42.822
Make sure you receive...

520
00:36:42.822 --> 00:36:45.322
back pay and the legal interest.

521
00:36:45.762 --> 00:36:47.532
Do I really need to?

522
00:36:47.932 --> 00:36:48.932
Good luck.

523
00:36:49.492 --> 00:36:50.702
I wish you victory.

524
00:36:56.133 --> 00:36:59.202
Anyway, thank you for fighting with me.

525
00:36:59.202 --> 00:37:00.213
You're a comrade.

526
00:37:09.883 --> 00:37:10.883
Hey.

527
00:37:15.023 --> 00:37:16.722
What is your name?

528
00:37:16.722 --> 00:37:17.722
Me?

529
00:37:18.162 --> 00:37:19.162
It's Baek June.

530
00:37:20.693 --> 00:37:21.793
Baek June.

531
00:37:25.162 --> 00:37:27.133
What is your name?

532
00:37:29.233 --> 00:37:30.242
Hyuk.

533
00:37:31.642 --> 00:37:32.702
Byun Hyuk.

534
00:37:35.512 --> 00:37:36.943
Byun Hyuk.

535
00:37:39.443 --> 00:37:41.912
It's a good name. It's stylish.

536
00:37:43.452 --> 00:37:44.923
Goodbye, Byun Hyuk.

537
00:37:53.293 --> 00:37:55.592
Before she called my name,

538
00:37:56.762 --> 00:38:00.633
I was just a gesture.

539
00:38:01.503 --> 00:38:03.842
When she called my name,

540
00:38:04.472 --> 00:38:06.972
I became...

541
00:38:07.642 --> 00:38:10.512
a flower.

542
00:38:27.262 --> 00:38:28.362
What happened?

543
00:38:29.193 --> 00:38:31.333
Why are you stopping me from entering?

544
00:38:33.472 --> 00:38:35.572
Just leave for today.

545
00:38:36.003 --> 00:38:39.503
We will calculate your back pay and compensation...

546
00:38:39.503 --> 00:38:40.813
and send it to your account.

547
00:38:44.782 --> 00:38:46.182
You must be misunderstanding...

548
00:38:46.512 --> 00:38:48.112
because I'm dressed like this.

549
00:38:48.853 --> 00:38:50.182
I'm not a worker.

550
00:38:52.383 --> 00:38:54.623
The manager gave us instructions to ban...

551
00:38:54.623 --> 00:38:56.862
employees from entering who caused trouble.

552
00:38:58.362 --> 00:39:01.633
This isn't right.

553
00:39:02.193 --> 00:39:04.733
I didn't want to reveal my identity.

554
00:39:06.133 --> 00:39:09.532
Don't reveal it. Don't tell anyone.

555
00:39:12.802 --> 00:39:14.912
I'm Byun Hyuk of Gangsoo Group.

556
00:39:18.713 --> 00:39:21.383
I'm the son of Chairman Byun Gang Soo.

557
00:39:22.952 --> 00:39:25.583
I really am. Believe me.

558
00:39:25.583 --> 00:39:26.782
- Hey. - Be quiet.

559
00:39:26.782 --> 00:39:29.392
I'm the son of Chairman Byun Gang Soo.

560
00:39:29.392 --> 00:39:31.362
- Let go. - Put him down.

561
00:39:31.362 --> 00:39:32.793
- Let me go. - Put him down.

562
00:39:40.373 --> 00:39:42.972
I'm the son of Chairman Byun Gang Soo.

563
00:39:43.202 --> 00:39:44.443
Be quiet.

564
00:39:44.443 --> 00:39:46.873
Will you come to your senses when we call the police?

565
00:39:49.313 --> 00:39:50.713
We're both going to die...

566
00:39:50.713 --> 00:39:52.182
if you keep becoming the center of gossip.

567
00:39:59.182 --> 00:40:01.052
My friend.

568
00:40:01.052 --> 00:40:03.523
My friend.

569
00:40:17.342 --> 00:40:18.673
Those punks.

570
00:40:19.472 --> 00:40:21.173
How could they throw someone out like this?

571
00:40:22.572 --> 00:40:25.813
I don't have my phone and wallet. What should I do?

572
00:40:47.503 --> 00:40:48.503
Comrade!

573
00:40:48.702 --> 00:40:50.103
Do you also take the bus from here?

574
00:40:50.103 --> 00:40:51.673
What? Yes.

575
00:40:52.103 --> 00:40:54.043
You're hurt.

576
00:40:54.373 --> 00:40:56.673
I was in a scuffle...

577
00:40:56.673 --> 00:40:58.043
while trying to get back in the hotel.

578
00:40:58.043 --> 00:40:59.912
Did they hit you?

579
00:41:02.912 --> 00:41:04.052
No.

580
00:41:04.353 --> 00:41:06.253
I was just slightly pitting my strength with them.

581
00:41:06.322 --> 00:41:08.952
I was like a lone Spartan warrior fighting...

582
00:41:08.952 --> 00:41:10.662
several ten millions of enemies.

583
00:41:10.662 --> 00:41:11.892
Can I borrow...

584
00:41:11.892 --> 00:41:14.762
your phone to make a call?

585
00:41:15.262 --> 00:41:17.932
I left my phone and wallet at the hotel.

586
00:41:18.563 --> 00:41:21.003
Did they also stop you from getting your personal items?

587
00:41:21.273 --> 00:41:23.702
They're vicious.

588
00:41:23.802 --> 00:41:25.842
Here, use it as much as you want to.

589
00:41:26.302 --> 00:41:27.313
Thank you.

590
00:41:33.952 --> 00:41:35.313
Doesn't it work?

591
00:41:35.983 --> 00:41:38.983
I always used speed-dial,

592
00:41:40.083 --> 00:41:41.722
so I don't remember the number.

593
00:41:45.193 --> 00:41:48.162
My bus is here. I have to go.

594
00:41:48.932 --> 00:41:50.302
Okay, thank you.

595
00:42:11.282 --> 00:42:13.052
Did you eat?

596
00:42:23.662 --> 00:42:24.932
What's wrong?

597
00:42:24.932 --> 00:42:26.403
I need to open a suite.

598
00:42:26.403 --> 00:42:28.173
We can't locate a guest.

599
00:42:28.173 --> 00:42:30.403
According to regulations, we can't open it without permission.

600
00:42:30.403 --> 00:42:32.773
I'm from the management support team of Gangsoo Group.

601
00:42:32.773 --> 00:42:36.242
The guest is Byun Hyuk, the second son of Byun Gang Soo.

602
00:42:40.753 --> 00:42:41.753
(The chairman's son)

603
00:42:41.753 --> 00:42:45.623
I'm Byun Hyuk, the son of Chairman Byun Gang Soo.

604
00:42:51.392 --> 00:42:52.892
I'm going to put some condiments,

605
00:42:56.532 --> 00:42:57.633
some salted shrimp,

606
00:42:59.802 --> 00:43:01.072
perilla powder,

607
00:43:03.273 --> 00:43:06.373
a lot of green onions,

608
00:43:06.373 --> 00:43:08.673
and kkakdugi liquid.

609
00:43:12.242 --> 00:43:13.242
Okay.

610
00:43:24.662 --> 00:43:27.963
Part-timers sometimes need to eat high protein food like this.

611
00:43:28.733 --> 00:43:29.793
Why aren't you eating?

612
00:43:31.202 --> 00:43:32.302
What is this?

613
00:43:34.233 --> 00:43:35.472
It's sundae gukbap.

614
00:43:37.572 --> 00:43:39.373
Is this your first time seeing sundae gukbap?

615
00:43:39.373 --> 00:43:41.412
It's my first time seeing sundae in water.

616
00:43:43.842 --> 00:43:45.713
You're pickier than you look.

617
00:43:46.512 --> 00:43:47.813
Try it first.

618
00:43:47.813 --> 00:43:48.813
Okay.

619
00:43:50.853 --> 00:43:54.023
Try eating some of that meat.

620
00:43:55.193 --> 00:43:56.693
It's my first time eating something that looks like this.

621
00:43:58.262 --> 00:44:00.293
This is pork head.

622
00:44:00.392 --> 00:44:02.492
These are the heart and intestines.

623
00:44:02.563 --> 00:44:03.563
That's the ear.

624
00:44:05.233 --> 00:44:06.233
Ear?

625
00:44:07.202 --> 00:44:08.603
The ear of a pig?

626
00:44:09.202 --> 00:44:10.202
Yes.

627
00:44:14.673 --> 00:44:15.912
Don't eat it if you don't want to.

628
00:44:17.112 --> 00:44:18.583
This is soul food for me.

629
00:44:18.583 --> 00:44:19.883
It's really delicious.

630
00:44:26.523 --> 00:44:28.092
Her soul is consoled...

631
00:44:28.392 --> 00:44:30.592
while eating pig's ear.

632
00:44:32.162 --> 00:44:33.262
I think...

633
00:44:33.992 --> 00:44:36.693
humans are really cruel.

634
00:44:38.903 --> 00:44:41.403
Don't you like pork?

635
00:44:41.403 --> 00:44:42.503
Are you a vegetarian?

636
00:44:42.503 --> 00:44:43.543
No.

637
00:44:43.603 --> 00:44:45.302
I think we should enjoy eating...

638
00:44:45.302 --> 00:44:46.813
for the noble sacrifice of the pigs.

639
00:44:53.012 --> 00:44:54.883
Do you know how much...

640
00:44:55.012 --> 00:44:56.713
the suite costs per day?

641
00:44:58.282 --> 00:44:59.383
About 1,200 dollars?

642
00:45:00.222 --> 00:45:02.222
My rent and living expenses for a month...

643
00:45:02.222 --> 00:45:04.423
is about 1,200 dollars.

644
00:45:04.793 --> 00:45:08.362
I have to work hard for a month to get that much money.

645
00:45:10.503 --> 00:45:11.802
Is that all you get?

646
00:45:13.103 --> 00:45:14.972
They looked like they were in a similar age group as us.

647
00:45:14.972 --> 00:45:16.403
They didn't pay that themselves.

648
00:45:16.403 --> 00:45:18.373
Of course, their parents paid for them.

649
00:45:18.373 --> 00:45:21.213
Yes, they were abusing their power with money from their parents.

650
00:45:21.213 --> 00:45:24.112
Korea's corruption perceptions index is increasing because of them.

651
00:45:24.112 --> 00:45:26.383
People like us are harmed because of them.

652
00:45:26.682 --> 00:45:28.182
What kind of harm?

653
00:45:28.182 --> 00:45:29.552
They make us feel a feeling of loss...

654
00:45:29.552 --> 00:45:31.722
and make us lose the will to do our best in life.

655
00:45:32.123 --> 00:45:33.353
They make us feel that life is futile,

656
00:45:33.353 --> 00:45:34.992
and that decreases our quality of life.

657
00:45:35.353 --> 00:45:38.523
But you can't say that they harmed us directly.

658
00:45:39.762 --> 00:45:42.133
You don't have a sense of reality.

659
00:45:42.733 --> 00:45:45.603
Because of them, we got kicked out.

660
00:45:47.403 --> 00:45:48.733
- That's right. - You...

661
00:45:48.833 --> 00:45:51.072
will keep being a pushover like this.

662
00:45:51.072 --> 00:45:54.713
Poor people like us have to be on our toes all the time.

663
00:45:55.242 --> 00:45:57.083
Don't forget what kind of country we're living in.

664
00:45:57.682 --> 00:45:58.983
What?

665
00:45:59.483 --> 00:46:02.782
What kind of country is this?

666
00:46:03.552 --> 00:46:05.883
My monthly living expenses are the same as their salaries.

667
00:46:07.123 --> 00:46:08.592
Is that why she mentioned the kind of this country?

668
00:46:09.153 --> 00:46:10.923
- Eat up. - Okay.

669
00:46:21.833 --> 00:46:23.702
Bye. It was nice meeting you.

670
00:46:24.072 --> 00:46:25.972
Me too.

671
00:46:26.642 --> 00:46:28.713
Oh, right. You must not have transportation fee either.

(The Second Son of Gangsoo Group Made a Scene on a Plane)

674
00:46:44.492 --> 00:46:45.892
Here, take this.

675
00:46:47.133 --> 00:46:49.262
Well...

676
00:46:50.733 --> 00:46:51.963
I have a favor to ask of you.

677
00:46:56.842 --> 00:46:58.202
There he comes!

678
00:47:06.742 --> 00:47:09.682
Sir, is it true about your son?

679
00:47:09.682 --> 00:47:11.083
Where is your second son?

680
00:47:11.083 --> 00:47:12.452
- Please say a word. - Did you talk to your son?

681
00:47:12.452 --> 00:47:13.722
- Sir. - Please make way.

682
00:47:13.722 --> 00:47:14.952
Please say a word.

683
00:47:20.932 --> 00:47:21.992
Oh, dear.

684
00:47:27.333 --> 00:47:29.173
- Sir. - Sir, please say a word.

685
00:47:29.173 --> 00:47:31.273
- Sir. - Where is your son?

686
00:47:31.273 --> 00:47:33.512
- Sir. - What did your son say about this?

687
00:47:38.512 --> 00:47:39.742
My apologies, sir.

688
00:47:40.182 --> 00:47:41.483
Where is he?

689
00:47:43.552 --> 00:47:45.753
Bring him to me immediately.

690
00:47:46.923 --> 00:47:47.952
Immediately!

691
00:47:48.392 --> 00:47:49.452
Yes, sir.

692
00:48:05.273 --> 00:48:07.412
Gosh, where on earth did he go?

693
00:48:08.472 --> 00:48:09.742
Excuse me. These.

694
00:48:10.713 --> 00:48:11.912
Where did you find those?

695
00:48:12.112 --> 00:48:13.983
They were in his locker.

696
00:48:15.353 --> 00:48:19.052
Does it mean he disappeared in a swimsuit?

697
00:48:22.023 --> 00:48:25.762
He wasn't captured in the footage after he went in the spa.

698
00:48:27.662 --> 00:48:30.362
That's impossible unless he was drowned to death.

699
00:48:31.032 --> 00:48:33.262
- Let's go through it again. - Okay.

700
00:50:01.052 --> 00:50:02.423
(Dad)

701
00:50:08.633 --> 00:50:09.693
Hello?

702
00:50:10.702 --> 00:50:12.302
Did you even do your job properly?

703
00:50:12.603 --> 00:50:14.603
How could you let such news to be broadcast?

704
00:50:15.333 --> 00:50:16.733
Why is that my fault?

705
00:50:16.733 --> 00:50:19.403
This wouldn't have happened if you had taken proper care of him.

706
00:50:21.273 --> 00:50:22.972
I can't do a better job than this.

707
00:50:23.583 --> 00:50:25.383
He's not a child, so I can't watch him 24 hours a day.

708
00:50:25.443 --> 00:50:27.313
You should if that's necessary.

709
00:50:29.583 --> 00:50:31.222
I'm so apologetic to the chairman.

710
00:50:31.222 --> 00:50:33.952
You don't have to be so anxious about my situation.

711
00:50:34.392 --> 00:50:36.753
What about Master Byun? Is he all right?

712
00:50:38.492 --> 00:50:40.633
- I'm looking for him. - Still?

713
00:50:41.492 --> 00:50:43.333
Gosh, where is he at this hour?

714
00:50:44.362 --> 00:50:47.972
It's cold outside. I'm worried he might get sick.

715
00:50:48.733 --> 00:50:51.242
That darn precious chairman's son...

716
00:50:51.242 --> 00:50:54.943
will be fine somewhere without any worries, so take care of yourself.

717
00:51:01.383 --> 00:51:04.623
Punk. I guess the work is hard-standing for him.

718
00:51:07.222 --> 00:51:10.862
Still, he should be grateful for the fact that he and I are...

719
00:51:10.862 --> 00:51:12.423
making our living thanks to the chairman.

720
00:51:13.833 --> 00:51:15.293
Ungrateful brat.

721
00:51:21.373 --> 00:51:23.173
Goodness.

722
00:51:23.543 --> 00:51:27.043
My dad has been calling him "Master Byun" all his life.

723
00:51:42.753 --> 00:51:43.892
Gosh, I'm so tired.

724
00:51:43.892 --> 00:51:45.092
Dad!

725
00:51:45.463 --> 00:51:48.262
Goodness, my son.

726
00:51:48.262 --> 00:51:50.262
How have you been, my Hyuk?

727
00:51:50.262 --> 00:51:51.403
Yes.

728
00:51:52.932 --> 00:51:54.403
Just a moment, Mr. Chairman.

729
00:51:57.403 --> 00:51:58.503
What?

730
00:52:03.072 --> 00:52:04.483
It's done, sir.

731
00:52:05.012 --> 00:52:06.782
All right. Let's go in.

732
00:52:15.423 --> 00:52:17.463
Je Hoon, bye.

733
00:52:19.923 --> 00:52:21.362
Good boy.

734
00:52:21.963 --> 00:52:24.563
Gosh, how have you been, my boy?

735
00:52:24.563 --> 00:52:27.173
What should we have for dinner, galbi or bulgogi?

736
00:52:27.403 --> 00:52:29.472
- Galbi! - That sounds good.

737
00:52:30.543 --> 00:52:32.043
I had no idea...

738
00:52:32.373 --> 00:52:36.142
I'd clean up his mess all my life until then.

739
00:52:36.883 --> 00:52:39.142
He's the eye sore in my life.

740
00:52:39.682 --> 00:52:43.052
But he's also my life's elevator which I can never let go of.

741
00:52:43.552 --> 00:52:45.483
He did nothing wrong.

742
00:52:45.653 --> 00:52:47.552
You darn time bomb.

743
00:52:47.623 --> 00:52:49.853
It's your fault to let him ride on the plane alone.

744
00:53:04.173 --> 00:53:08.373
(The Second Son of Gangsoo Group Made a Scene on a Plane)

745
00:53:11.983 --> 00:53:13.682
(The Second Son of Gangsoo Group Made a Scene on a Plane)

746
00:53:17.483 --> 00:53:20.653
Whichever humiliation I may face, I'll put up with it.

747
00:53:21.693 --> 00:53:23.623
I'll get compensated for this no matter what.

748
00:53:24.963 --> 00:53:27.333
- He's something. - Hyuk is?

749
00:53:28.463 --> 00:53:30.032
I don't think so.

750
00:53:30.733 --> 00:53:32.403
I felt so frustrated...

751
00:53:32.403 --> 00:53:36.233
that I came here for a talisman to stop him from causing more trouble.

752
00:53:36.572 --> 00:53:38.673
You'll only block his future if you use a talisman.

753
00:53:38.702 --> 00:53:40.543
He's on his way to become great at the moment.

754
00:53:40.873 --> 00:53:43.583
People called Einstein stupid when he was little.

755
00:53:43.642 --> 00:53:46.213
Edison was kicked out of his school.

756
00:53:46.412 --> 00:53:50.153
You know that Steve Jobs was once a drug addict, right?

757
00:53:50.153 --> 00:53:53.423
My goodness. Jobs was addicted to drugs?

758
00:53:54.052 --> 00:53:57.092
He has a perfect balance of negative and positive.

759
00:53:57.592 --> 00:54:00.733
He's born lucky with people, wealth, and everything.

760
00:54:01.362 --> 00:54:03.233
Don't be so anxious and relax.

761
00:54:14.512 --> 00:54:16.373
How should I persuade him?

762
00:54:17.383 --> 00:54:19.383
I need to start off smoothly...

763
00:54:19.383 --> 00:54:21.182
so that he doesn't feel uncomfortable.

764
00:54:24.423 --> 00:54:27.023
Actually, this might not work out.

765
00:54:27.322 --> 00:54:29.023
He was such a rude, mean jerk.

766
00:54:29.653 --> 00:54:31.892
I'll ask him since your situation is desperate,

767
00:54:31.923 --> 00:54:33.293
but don't expect too much.

768
00:54:33.293 --> 00:54:36.392
By the way, June. Can I have one more of this?

769
00:54:36.903 --> 00:54:38.202
It's delicious, right?

770
00:54:38.802 --> 00:54:41.403
It's 7 dollars, but I'll make it 6 dollars for you.

771
00:54:41.503 --> 00:54:43.133
I'll pay you back as soon as I find my wallet.

772
00:54:45.043 --> 00:54:47.142
Don't forget. It's 30 dollars for a stay.

773
00:54:47.142 --> 00:54:48.242
Okay.

774
00:54:56.583 --> 00:54:58.623
No, that's not going to happen.

775
00:54:58.623 --> 00:55:02.793
Come on. Don't be like this and let him stay for one night.

776
00:55:03.423 --> 00:55:06.362
He was kicked out without any money, so he had nowhere else to go.

777
00:55:06.362 --> 00:55:09.162
It's cold outside, so I couldn't ignore him.

778
00:55:09.563 --> 00:55:13.003
I don't see why I have to let a stranger sleep over at my house.

779
00:55:15.633 --> 00:55:17.773
For the universal mankind's sake,

780
00:55:17.773 --> 00:55:19.903
share a little bit of your private place with him.

781
00:55:20.165 --> 00:55:21.205
No.

782
00:55:21.842 --> 00:55:24.512
Je Hoon, why are you so cold-hearted?

783
00:55:28.903 --> 00:55:29.932
What?

784
00:55:30.247 --> 00:55:31.546
Oh, gosh.

785
00:55:31.546 --> 00:55:33.886
- Help me! - What's the matter?

786
00:55:36.216 --> 00:55:37.287
Why?

787
00:55:37.287 --> 00:55:39.557
- What is it? - There's a mouse here.

788
00:55:39.557 --> 00:55:42.687
It's a mouse. It's so fast.

789
00:55:47.296 --> 00:55:48.296
What is this?

790
00:55:48.667 --> 00:55:51.466
This is the person I was talking about.

791
00:55:51.466 --> 00:55:53.937
He's my comrade who was fired from the hotel because of me.

792
00:55:54.537 --> 00:55:55.607
Comrade?

793
00:55:56.107 --> 00:55:57.107
Nice to meet you.

794
00:55:57.937 --> 00:55:59.377
"Nice to meet you"?

795
00:56:00.946 --> 00:56:02.377
I told you he's cold.

796
00:56:03.946 --> 00:56:06.787
Yes, I understand.

797
00:56:11.287 --> 00:56:13.727
Please let him stay overnight.

798
00:56:14.187 --> 00:56:15.727
If you don't let him,

799
00:56:15.926 --> 00:56:17.627
I'll need to let him sleep in my room.

800
00:56:18.096 --> 00:56:19.756
- What? - Really?

801
00:56:19.756 --> 00:56:21.526
But I can't do that.

802
00:56:21.767 --> 00:56:23.267
We can't sleep in the same room.

803
00:56:28.406 --> 00:56:29.866
He's going to give us the money.

804
00:56:29.866 --> 00:56:31.477
Let's share.

805
00:56:34.147 --> 00:56:35.807
He looks cold on the outside,

806
00:56:35.807 --> 00:56:37.716
but his heart is as vast as the sea.

807
00:56:37.716 --> 00:56:39.446
- He looks really kind. - Of course.

808
00:56:40.216 --> 00:56:42.817
I feel bad for him. Just for one night.

809
00:56:48.187 --> 00:56:49.187
Gosh.

810
00:56:50.656 --> 00:56:51.997
What happened?

811
00:56:52.096 --> 00:56:53.196
As you can see,

812
00:56:53.196 --> 00:56:55.067
because of my clothes, there was a misunderstanding.

813
00:56:55.067 --> 00:56:56.667
I couldn't even get my cell phone back,

814
00:56:56.667 --> 00:56:58.236
so I couldn't call you.

815
00:56:58.636 --> 00:57:00.906
So how did you end up here?

816
00:57:00.906 --> 00:57:02.307
I know, right?

817
00:57:02.307 --> 00:57:04.736
We must be destined.

818
00:57:08.776 --> 00:57:11.116
So this is what your room looks like.

819
00:57:19.386 --> 00:57:21.187
Stand up. Let's go home.

820
00:57:21.187 --> 00:57:23.026
I can't.

821
00:57:24.756 --> 00:57:26.096
Didn't you see the news?

822
00:57:26.096 --> 00:57:28.366
That's why I can't go home.

823
00:57:29.466 --> 00:57:31.966
Go and turn yourself in. We can't stop this any longer.

824
00:57:32.397 --> 00:57:34.037
The chairman wants that too.

825
00:57:35.767 --> 00:57:36.807
Je Hoon.

826
00:57:40.247 --> 00:57:41.406
Chae Ri...

827
00:57:41.946 --> 00:57:43.946
cheated on me with my friend.

828
00:57:44.276 --> 00:57:46.147
I saw her with him at the hotel.

829
00:57:48.946 --> 00:57:50.917
It's been a hard day for me.

830
00:57:50.917 --> 00:57:53.826
I want to at least be able to sleep well.

831
00:57:54.886 --> 00:57:57.997
Can't you just stay by my side and comfort me as my friend?

832
00:58:00.897 --> 00:58:02.727
You really are incorrigible.

833
00:58:03.026 --> 00:58:05.337
The company is in such big trouble because of you.

834
00:58:05.636 --> 00:58:08.167
And yet, you're having a hard day because of your girlfriend?

835
00:58:12.236 --> 00:58:13.676
This is the last night.

836
00:58:15.276 --> 00:58:17.317
- What? - If I turn in myself tomorrow,

837
00:58:17.576 --> 00:58:19.477
I'll have to stay in prison.

838
00:58:20.147 --> 00:58:22.346
It's going to be the last night for me.

839
00:58:25.587 --> 00:58:28.057
Please stay with me, my friend.

840
00:58:28.087 --> 00:58:29.156
My friend.

841
00:58:29.656 --> 00:58:31.426
My friend.

842
00:58:38.037 --> 00:58:40.337
(Expiration Date for my 2 years of installment savings)

843
00:58:43.067 --> 00:58:44.807
I lost all my precious savings...

844
00:58:44.807 --> 00:58:46.946
because of that weird girl.

845
00:58:47.977 --> 00:58:50.176
It was the best part time job that paid well.

846
00:58:52.917 --> 00:58:55.917
What should I do to fill my schedule?

847
00:59:02.486 --> 00:59:03.796
(Chauffeur service, Convenience Store)

848
00:59:13.736 --> 00:59:15.307
They didn't respect my rights...

849
00:59:15.307 --> 00:59:16.937
and treated me like an expendable.

850
00:59:17.307 --> 00:59:19.877
I quit right away and came out.

851
00:59:20.607 --> 00:59:21.647
I made the right call, right?

852
00:59:24.017 --> 00:59:27.287
If I had been so loyal to the company,

853
00:59:27.616 --> 00:59:29.716
I would have gotten hurt like you.

854
00:59:30.716 --> 00:59:33.057
You do understand why I don't want to...

855
00:59:33.787 --> 00:59:35.057
work as a full-time employee, right?

856
00:59:43.167 --> 00:59:45.397
- You should sleep here. - Can't I sleep on the bed?

857
00:59:45.397 --> 00:59:46.636
It hurts my back.

858
00:59:47.807 --> 00:59:49.006
No.

859
01:00:03.486 --> 01:00:05.287
What's June like?

860
01:00:05.457 --> 01:00:07.227
She's out of the ordinary.

861
01:00:07.227 --> 01:00:08.587
Out of the ordinary?

862
01:00:08.886 --> 01:00:11.326
She lives off part time jobs and thinks she's doing fine.

863
01:00:11.326 --> 01:00:12.926
- She's cool. - What?

864
01:00:12.926 --> 01:00:15.526
She's the savior of my life. She's like the light for me.

865
01:00:15.796 --> 01:00:16.796
What are you talking about?

866
01:00:16.796 --> 01:00:19.937
If it weren't for her, I would've starved to death on the road today.

867
01:00:20.537 --> 01:00:22.236
She's the first person...

868
01:00:22.506 --> 01:00:23.506
that has been nice to me.

869
01:00:23.506 --> 01:00:25.307
She's just nosy.

870
01:00:25.307 --> 01:00:27.107
I want to return the favor.

871
01:00:27.977 --> 01:00:28.977
Did you borrow money from her?

872
01:00:28.977 --> 01:00:30.517
Just the rent and three bowls of ramyeon.

873
01:00:30.517 --> 01:00:31.676
39 dollars.

874
01:00:32.747 --> 01:00:34.247
You went to a stranger...

875
01:00:34.247 --> 01:00:36.116
and asked her for ramyeon and rent?

876
01:00:37.886 --> 01:00:39.756
I can't believe June.

877
01:00:41.357 --> 01:00:42.457
Stay down there.

878
01:00:49.466 --> 01:00:53.267
I used to spend that much money just to pay for one meal.

879
01:00:54.437 --> 01:00:56.636
It was so miserable not having that money.

880
01:00:57.776 --> 01:00:59.176
It hurt my pride too.

881
01:00:59.176 --> 01:01:00.446
I had to lower myself.

882
01:01:00.707 --> 01:01:02.107
Did you realize that today?

883
01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.346
But I...

884
01:01:05.076 --> 01:01:06.886
realized I was a fool...

885
01:01:06.886 --> 01:01:08.616
that can't even make 10 dollars by myself.

886
01:01:12.156 --> 01:01:15.486
You told me I received privileges...

887
01:01:16.727 --> 01:01:18.857
for obeying my dad.

888
01:01:20.796 --> 01:01:22.267
I understand it now.

889
01:01:26.196 --> 01:01:28.006
What happened to you?

890
01:01:30.176 --> 01:01:32.607
But June won't obey.

891
01:01:32.977 --> 01:01:34.346
She doesn't think he's the king.

892
01:01:34.647 --> 01:01:36.817
She turned the place upside down saying that...

893
01:01:36.817 --> 01:01:38.647
she can't give up her rights and pride because of money.

894
01:01:38.647 --> 01:01:40.417
She was so full of swag.

895
01:01:40.946 --> 01:01:43.417
You should have seen that.

896
01:01:43.417 --> 01:01:45.357
She lost her temper again.

897
01:01:49.156 --> 01:01:51.526
How did you first meet June?

898
01:01:51.526 --> 01:01:53.156
Have you lived here for a long time?

899
01:01:54.067 --> 01:01:55.567
You don't need to know that.

900
01:01:55.627 --> 01:01:56.736
It's none of your business.

901
01:02:20.857 --> 01:02:22.187
Didn't you hear me?

902
01:02:28.696 --> 01:02:29.727
I...

903
01:02:30.236 --> 01:02:31.497
like you.

904
01:02:33.196 --> 01:02:35.866
I like you.

905
01:02:47.046 --> 01:02:48.046
So what?

906
01:02:48.846 --> 01:02:49.846
What do you want me to do?

907
01:03:14.247 --> 01:03:15.707
Gosh.

908
01:03:16.147 --> 01:03:18.247
Every time I think about this, it frustrates me.

909
01:03:18.546 --> 01:03:21.787
"People are given values according to what they do"?

910
01:03:22.116 --> 01:03:24.357
Kwon Je Hoon, you have the same mindset...

911
01:03:24.357 --> 01:03:26.886
as the weird girl and the manager that kicked me out.

912
01:03:31.026 --> 01:03:32.997
Gosh, you jerk!

913
01:03:39.236 --> 01:03:40.236
I...

914
01:03:41.366 --> 01:03:42.667
like you.

915
01:03:44.776 --> 01:03:47.307
I like you.

916
01:03:50.946 --> 01:03:52.216
How close are you two?

917
01:03:54.917 --> 01:03:57.716
You two aren't dating, right?

918
01:03:59.886 --> 01:04:00.986
What...

919
01:04:02.687 --> 01:04:04.557
Stop talking nonsense, and go back to sleep.

920
01:04:04.557 --> 01:04:06.256
Right? Okay. Of course not.

921
01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:08.397
I knew it wasn't' like that.

922
01:04:12.837 --> 01:04:13.837
But...

923
01:04:14.437 --> 01:04:17.736
why did you ask me if we're dating?

924
01:04:18.307 --> 01:04:20.946
- Do you... - I think June likes me.

925
01:04:22.076 --> 01:04:23.076
What?

926
01:04:23.346 --> 01:04:25.616
Then why would she have been so nice to me?

927
01:04:25.616 --> 01:04:27.587
She took care of me.

928
01:04:27.587 --> 01:04:29.087
She took me with her all day,

929
01:04:29.087 --> 01:04:30.817
let me ride her car, bought me meals,

930
01:04:31.087 --> 01:04:32.817
and even let me sleep here.

931
01:04:32.917 --> 01:04:34.826
She's probably into me.

932
01:04:35.187 --> 01:04:36.796
I'm always so popular.

933
01:04:39.897 --> 01:04:40.897
Hey.

934
01:04:41.096 --> 01:04:43.096
You need to get up early in the morning to go turn yourself in.

935
01:04:43.096 --> 01:04:45.296
So go to sleep, okay?

936
01:04:48.307 --> 01:04:49.537
Je Hoon, please take good care of her...

937
01:04:50.176 --> 01:04:52.276
while I'm gone.

938
01:04:57.176 --> 01:04:58.776
What do you mean that it's hard to live in Korea?

939
01:05:06.187 --> 01:05:07.857
How dare you talk to me that way?

940
01:05:12.796 --> 01:05:14.397
It hurts.

941
01:05:38.287 --> 01:05:39.557
I think...

942
01:05:42.057 --> 01:05:43.857
I'm in love with her.

943
01:05:47.096 --> 01:05:48.826
Everything before her...

944
01:05:50.636 --> 01:05:52.167
was just rehearsals.

945
01:06:02.977 --> 01:06:04.377
I think I finally met...

946
01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:08.546
the woman of my destiny.

947
01:06:46.617 --> 01:06:50.197
(Revolutionary Love)

948
01:06:50.296 --> 01:06:51.796
- Just do this first. - It's like the underworld.

949
01:06:51.796 --> 01:06:53.867
I was just following her, and I'm now working a part-time job.

950
01:06:53.867 --> 01:06:54.867
Save me.

951
01:06:54.867 --> 01:06:56.897
Don't get in trouble by running wild.

952
01:06:56.897 --> 01:06:58.166
Just stay in your place.

953
01:06:58.166 --> 01:06:59.367
Why? What happened?

954
01:06:59.367 --> 01:07:01.536
I'm going to last until the end.

955
01:07:01.536 --> 01:07:04.506
I have the woman of my destiny and my best friend.

956
01:07:04.506 --> 01:07:06.607
This is true paradise.

957
01:07:07.477 --> 01:07:09.907
Please educate your child properly.

958
01:07:09.907 --> 01:07:12.147
Look at the mess he created.

959
01:07:12.147 --> 01:07:13.687
Is your chairman's son in trouble again?

960
01:07:13.687 --> 01:07:14.886
Why is he like that?

961
01:07:14.886 --> 01:07:18.216
I can't stay like this. I need to prove that I'm not an evil force.
