Kang Chi Hwan. Calm down.

2
00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:27.507
Let her go,

3
00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:29.538
and let's talk.

4
00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:31.507
Don't try to trick me.

5
00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:32.607
No!

6
00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:00.938
Gosh.

9
00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:33.808
Why did I run away?

10
00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:35.877
I realized...

11
00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:38.648
it'd be a hassle.

12
00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:41.948
Exams are coming up soon.

13
00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:44.288
I'm a straight-A student,

14
00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:46.588
so I can't let my parents down.

15
00:01:49.187 --> 00:01:51.928
If that's how you're trying to get out from here,

16
00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:54.758
you should give up now.

00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:05.568
You know this, right?

19
00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.178
I do.

Kang Chi Hwan.

23
00:02:15.947 --> 00:02:18.947
You committed murder according to the postings...

24
00:02:19.287 --> 00:02:20.787
on the fan fiction website.

25
00:02:21.187 --> 00:02:22.187
Come on.

26
00:02:22.918 --> 00:02:24.227
Don't be like this.

27
00:02:24.527 --> 00:02:25.988
Don't be like an amateur.

28
00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:29.058
Maybe other people practiced...

29
00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:32.428
committing fake murder for fun.

30
00:02:33.428 --> 00:02:35.937
Is that wrong? It's not a crime.

31
00:02:37.338 --> 00:02:39.168
They didn't kill for real.

32
00:02:40.808 --> 00:02:42.178
Murder practice?

33
00:02:43.377 --> 00:02:44.447
Isn't that website...

34
00:02:45.747 --> 00:02:47.148
really interesting?

35
00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:50.648
When I read from it,

36
00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.958
my fingers start to tingle,

37
00:02:54.787 --> 00:02:55.958
and sometimes...

38
00:02:56.558 --> 00:03:00.027
I feel like I'm actually committing murder.

39
00:03:03.257 --> 00:03:04.727
Don't you want to know...

40
00:03:06.697 --> 00:03:07.937
what it feels like...

41
00:03:10.298 --> 00:03:11.608
to kill someone?

42
00:03:13.608 --> 00:03:17.078
People will die eventually.

43
00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:22.618
Why do I have to waste my time...

44
00:03:22.947 --> 00:03:24.947
for people who are already dead?

45
00:03:26.148 --> 00:03:28.217
He's not nervous at all.

46
00:03:29.157 --> 00:03:32.727
He's aware that there's no clear evidence to prove his murder.

47
00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:33.898
If this continues,

48
00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:37.067
he'll be transferred to prosecutors for special injury.

49
00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:41.738
We don't have an excuse keep him here.

51
00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:49.638
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:50.447 --> 00:03:52.108
Kang Chi Hwan's a first offender.

53
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:54.947
If he feels intimidated by the surrounding,

54
00:03:55.618 --> 00:03:57.817
he'll feel pressured psychologically.

55
00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:23.478
Do you remember this student?

56
00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:25.707
You two studied the same major,

57
00:04:26.007 --> 00:04:27.418
but she was recently murdered.

58
00:04:33.988 --> 00:04:35.288
We operated...

59
00:04:35.587 --> 00:04:38.187
a mystery club called...

60
00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:39.988
"Journal Holmse".

61
00:04:40.827 --> 00:04:44.197
I found her cute, but then she got so clingy,

62
00:04:44.968 --> 00:04:46.728
so I stopped seeing her.

63
00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:49.197
By the way,

64
00:04:49.598 --> 00:04:51.267
who killed her?

65
00:05:00.278 --> 00:05:01.918
That's Ko Joon Hee we talked about earlier.

66
00:05:03.147 --> 00:05:04.887
She's the first victim of the incident.

67
00:05:05.348 --> 00:05:07.788
She was electrocuted with a stun gun,

68
00:05:08.118 --> 00:05:11.058
abducted, tortured,

69
00:05:12.058 --> 00:05:13.457
and abandoned at the end...

70
00:05:13.798 --> 00:05:15.028
like a piece of garbage.

(Body found near Sin Mok Stream)

72
00:05:19.197 --> 00:05:20.668
She's a victim of shooting incident.

73
00:05:26.038 --> 00:05:29.238
There's a narrowing construction area near Nadeulmok.

74
00:05:30.007 --> 00:05:31.408
If you want to get on the outer road,

75
00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:33.817
you must pass this narrow road.

76
00:05:35.747 --> 00:05:37.418
When the man selects a target,

77
00:05:37.988 --> 00:05:40.317
he slows down on purpose...

78
00:05:41.017 --> 00:05:43.058
and blocks the woman's path.

79
00:05:43.728 --> 00:05:47.298
The car behind gets upset, so she comes up,

80
00:05:47.298 --> 00:05:49.358
then the man doesn't miss the chance...

81
00:05:49.358 --> 00:05:51.627
and shoots the gun like this!

82
00:05:55.868 --> 00:05:58.808
Did I get anything wrong?

83
00:05:59.908 --> 00:06:02.978
The order of the crime, pattern, method,

84
00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:04.077
and even the after-measures.

85
00:06:05.647 --> 00:06:06.978
It's all perfect.

86
00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:12.918
How did you find the culprit's signature?

87
00:06:13.187 --> 00:06:14.187
Pardon?

88
00:06:15.457 --> 00:06:18.158
It's all in the fan fiction.

89
00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:21.158
I only repeated it.

90
00:06:21.397 --> 00:06:24.397
It sounds like you're admitting your crime.

91
00:06:27.298 --> 00:06:30.937
I think I told you earlier that I'm smart.

92
00:06:34.108 --> 00:06:35.608
Do you have any more questions?

93
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.278
You dimmed the light...

94
00:06:43.447 --> 00:06:45.247
and lowered the temperature.

95
00:06:46.747 --> 00:06:50.827
You showed me the photos of victims on purpose,

96
00:06:52.358 --> 00:06:54.957
and you continued to stay silent...

97
00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:57.598
to intimidate me psychologically.

98
00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:01.837
What's wrong?

99
00:07:03.567 --> 00:07:05.468
Did I miss anything?

100
00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:12.647
Is it possible...

101
00:07:13.247 --> 00:07:16.178
to lower the temperature more?

102
00:07:17.447 --> 00:07:18.988
I have a lot of heat in my body.

103
00:07:19.988 --> 00:07:22.317
My brain works better...

104
00:07:22.858 --> 00:07:25.228
when my head is cold.

105
00:07:28.327 --> 00:07:30.197
Left-handed and tall.

106
00:07:30.528 --> 00:07:33.627
He matches the suspect's appearance caught on the surveillance camera.

107
00:07:33.798 --> 00:07:36.437
He took the same lectures with Ko Joon Hee,

108
00:07:36.437 --> 00:07:37.937
and they joined the same club.

109
00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:40.067
They're administrators of the fan fiction club.

110
00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:43.308
Above all, on the day the murder notice was posted,

111
00:07:43.377 --> 00:07:46.147
he abducted Son Na Kyung as what's written in the posting.

112
00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:48.218
Do we still need more evidence?

113
00:07:48.377 --> 00:07:51.548
Without a conclusive evidence, we can't imprison him for murder.

114
00:07:51.548 --> 00:07:53.187
The problem is...

115
00:07:53.817 --> 00:07:55.757
the website closed down...

116
00:07:55.757 --> 00:07:57.788
because the information leaked.

117
00:07:58.288 --> 00:08:01.327
I can't trace the club members anymore.

118
00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:03.798
I'm sure they moved the website...

119
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.997
instead of closing it.

120
00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.238
Now that he's on it again,

121
00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:11.137
he'll never stop.

(The Night Reaper)

123
00:08:30.687 --> 00:08:34.798
(The Night Reaper)

124
00:08:51.008 --> 00:08:52.248
- Excuse me. - Yes?

125
00:08:52.248 --> 00:08:54.617
Have you seen this person?

126
00:08:54.748 --> 00:08:56.987
No, I haven't.

127
00:08:58.748 --> 00:09:00.388
- Excuse me. - Yes?

128
00:09:00.418 --> 00:09:02.617
Have you seen this person?

129
00:09:03.617 --> 00:09:05.528
No, I haven't.

130
00:09:25.048 --> 00:09:26.077
Mother.

131
00:09:26.707 --> 00:09:27.847
I...

132
00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:31.447
can't get hold of Seo Young for two days now.

133
00:09:31.687 --> 00:09:32.687
Yes.

134
00:09:33.758 --> 00:09:36.058
We had a fight preparing for the wedding,

135
00:09:36.258 --> 00:09:38.128
but I could always get hold of her.

136
00:09:39.687 --> 00:09:43.258
Don't you think I should tell Father?

137
00:09:43.357 --> 00:09:45.268
We need more time.

138
00:09:46.768 --> 00:09:49.038
I know what you mean,

139
00:09:49.168 --> 00:09:52.607
but solving the case is more important than justifying oneself.

140
00:09:58.977 --> 00:10:00.378
Trust me.

141
00:10:00.477 --> 00:10:02.248
I will solve this.

142
00:10:08.187 --> 00:10:11.357
We have some breaking news. We're shocked to hear...

143
00:10:11.357 --> 00:10:14.128
that during the chase that happened in the middle of the town...

144
00:10:14.158 --> 00:10:16.597
as NCI was trying arrest a suspect of an abduction case,

145
00:10:16.597 --> 00:10:20.467
three citizens were hit by a car and were hospitalized.

146
00:10:42.587 --> 00:10:44.687
It's like we're on a pilgrimage.

147
00:10:45.558 --> 00:10:47.197
These are the traces of the Reaper.

148
00:10:49.028 --> 00:10:51.628
- This is the place. - Look.

149
00:10:51.628 --> 00:10:55.298
(The Night Reaper)

150
00:10:55.298 --> 00:10:58.408
Guys, isn't this place a little scary?

151
00:10:59.467 --> 00:11:00.508
Really?

152
00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:20.898
These stories were kept secret, but people started adding more to them.

153
00:11:20.998 --> 00:11:23.628
It's hard to find the person who wrote it first.

154
00:11:23.628 --> 00:11:26.298
The original site was closed down, but people are making...

155
00:11:26.498 --> 00:11:28.798
more and more similar websites after this case became well-known.

156
00:11:29.998 --> 00:11:32.737
It seems unlikely that we'd find anything through the internet.

157
00:11:33.268 --> 00:11:36.178
If we can't stop the supporters,

158
00:11:36.577 --> 00:11:39.847
many more of Kang Chi Hwan will appear.

159
00:11:39.977 --> 00:11:41.617
That could be the chaos...

160
00:11:42.617 --> 00:11:44.388
that the Reaper wants.

161
00:11:48.388 --> 00:11:51.388
There have been superiors' orders to abort the investigation.

162
00:11:52.227 --> 00:11:53.587
From now on,

163
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:57.227
regional investigation unit will be in charge.

164
00:11:57.498 --> 00:11:58.567
All right?

165
00:11:59.327 --> 00:12:02.668
The superiors seem to believe that the fact that NCI is in charge...

166
00:12:02.837 --> 00:12:06.567
could only stimulate the culprits of this case.

167
00:12:06.967 --> 00:12:10.778
As you may already know, the public already has a negative view...

168
00:12:10.778 --> 00:12:12.347
on this team, and it could worsen.

169
00:12:12.548 --> 00:12:15.977
Chief Director Baek, the Reaper is after us.

170
00:12:16.178 --> 00:12:19.187
Are you asking us to step out in such a situation?

171
00:12:19.388 --> 00:12:21.087
This is an order, so proceed accordingly.

172
00:12:22.288 --> 00:12:23.658
Do you understand, Team Manager Kang?

173
00:13:08.097 --> 00:13:10.808
What? On Chief Manager Baek?

174
00:13:25.487 --> 00:13:27.457
Team Manager Kang, you should take a look at this.

175
00:13:27.717 --> 00:13:29.717
Someone uploaded a strange writing on the bulletin board.

176
00:13:29.857 --> 00:13:30.888
Here.

177
00:13:30.888 --> 00:13:32.158
(NCI Bulletin Board)

178
00:13:33.558 --> 00:13:35.128
(The woman was looking at a building with so many windows.)

179
00:13:40.638 --> 00:13:42.337
(NCI Bulletin Board)

180
00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:44.107
Someone could be...

181
00:13:45.308 --> 00:13:47.378
leaving us a message.

182
00:13:50.707 --> 00:13:52.808
(The woman was looking at a building with so many windows.)

183
00:13:54.018 --> 00:13:56.748
"The woman was looking at a building with so many windows."

184
00:13:57.347 --> 00:13:58.687
"I will die here."

185
00:13:58.788 --> 00:14:00.888
"If possible, I want it to be today."

186
00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.357
"I hope you are the one that kills me."

187
00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:07.928
I think the style has gotten a little different.

188
00:14:07.998 --> 00:14:11.028
Until now, the stories have directly described the murders.

189
00:14:11.197 --> 00:14:14.138
But this one is indirectly predicting a murder.

190
00:14:16.798 --> 00:14:20.067
A woman who is asleep. A drowsy sunlight.

191
00:14:21.808 --> 00:14:23.477
It's describing an afternoon.

192
00:14:24.808 --> 00:14:27.617
And there are passersby and a bus stop.

193
00:14:28.977 --> 00:14:30.717
People without facial expressions.

194
00:14:31.317 --> 00:14:34.918
Team Manager Kang, near the bus stop 271,

195
00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:36.957
there's a department store with a clock tower.

196
00:14:37.357 --> 00:14:40.087
In front of the store, there's a crosswalk and an intersection.

197
00:14:47.538 --> 00:14:50.567
It's describing the road we were hiding to catch Kang Chi Hwan.

198
00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:53.937
The Reaper.

199
00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:57.178
This must be the Reaper's writing.

200
00:14:58.678 --> 00:15:00.977
Son Na Kyung is hospitalized at Seojin Hospital.

201
00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:02.477
Yes.

202
00:15:04.388 --> 00:15:07.258
Team Manager Kang, I found out where the chief director is.

203
00:15:07.957 --> 00:15:09.258
He's at Seojin Hospital.

204
00:15:16.558 --> 00:15:19.227
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

205
00:15:20.067 --> 00:15:21.768
The chief director is not answering my calls.

206
00:15:39.288 --> 00:15:40.518
Where am I supposed to go to?

207
00:16:02.908 --> 00:16:05.808
What do you want me to do?

208
00:16:06.178 --> 00:16:08.778
Why? Are you disappointed...

209
00:16:09.447 --> 00:16:11.317
that it's not your daughter?

210
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:13.788
Where is she?

211
00:16:14.388 --> 00:16:16.258
If you really want to see her,

212
00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:18.857
I'll let you see her.

213
00:16:42.477 --> 00:16:43.617
How do you like it?

214
00:16:44.048 --> 00:16:46.548
Now, if you want to save your daughter,

215
00:16:47.487 --> 00:16:49.418
kill the woman next to you.

216
00:16:52.327 --> 00:16:53.327
What's wrong?

217
00:16:53.857 --> 00:16:56.957
Isn't your family the one thing that you are afraid of losing?

218
00:16:57.567 --> 00:16:59.597
If you want something from me, let's meet up.

219
00:17:00.898 --> 00:17:01.967
Please.

220
00:17:02.837 --> 00:17:04.237
Don't do anything to her.

221
00:17:04.808 --> 00:17:06.768
Are you begging me?

222
00:17:09.837 --> 00:17:11.407
Gosh, you guys.

223
00:17:12.147 --> 00:17:15.847
Why is everything so complicated with you guys?

224
00:17:17.117 --> 00:17:18.917
Your family is dying.

225
00:17:19.847 --> 00:17:21.288
To save your daughter,

226
00:17:22.188 --> 00:17:23.587
kill her.

227
00:17:24.188 --> 00:17:25.357
Kim Yong Chul,

228
00:17:26.127 --> 00:17:28.228
you've got this the wrong way.

229
00:17:28.657 --> 00:17:31.728
If you just do as I tell you, I'll let your daughter go.

230
00:17:33.667 --> 00:17:35.097
You have only once chance.

231
00:17:37.407 --> 00:17:38.768
Do you see the drawer?

232
00:17:41.137 --> 00:17:42.337
Open it.

233
00:17:55.887 --> 00:17:57.188
Pick the scalpel up.

234
00:18:03.498 --> 00:18:04.597
You know what to do.

235
00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:12.038
Don't hesitate, and kill her at once.

236
00:19:15.567 --> 00:19:17.867
Son Na Kyung. Son Na Kyung.

237
00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:21.407
I called the Chief Director's house...

238
00:19:21.407 --> 00:19:23.438
and found out that his daughter has been missing for days.

239
00:19:26.347 --> 00:19:28.847
The Reaper must have abducted his daughter to threaten him.

240
00:19:29.548 --> 00:19:32.317
He's using the same method that he had used on me.

241
00:19:40.998 --> 00:19:43.127
Track Chief Director Baek's car.

242
00:20:00.478 --> 00:20:02.877
(National Criminal Investigation)

243
00:20:03.248 --> 00:20:05.288
There's another posting on the bulletin board.

244
00:20:05.347 --> 00:20:07.758
(Near Route 27, a quiet cafe with a view of the lake.)

245
00:20:09.087 --> 00:20:11.258
"Near Route 27,"

246
00:20:11.258 --> 00:20:13.857
"a quiet cafe with a view of the lake."

247
00:20:46.157 --> 00:20:47.798
Why did you come so late?

248
00:20:47.927 --> 00:20:50.198
I already had two cups of coffee.

249
00:20:50.798 --> 00:20:51.798
Kim Yong Chul.

250
00:20:52.597 --> 00:20:53.798
Where is Chief Director Baek?

251
00:20:54.738 --> 00:20:56.198
Why are you in such a hurry?

252
00:20:57.107 --> 00:20:59.337
Don't just stand there. Take a seat.

253
00:20:59.667 --> 00:21:01.978
There must be a lot of things you'd like to hear from me.

254
00:21:02.107 --> 00:21:03.677
Don't think about doing anything stupid.

255
00:21:05.248 --> 00:21:06.248
Kang Ki Hyung.

256
00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:09.478
Your pet is rather noisy.

257
00:21:09.617 --> 00:21:12.718
You won't be able to step out of this room.

258
00:21:15.917 --> 00:21:16.958
Do you want to make a bet?

259
00:21:17.887 --> 00:21:21.458
Let's see if I can just walk out of this room in 10 minutes or not.

260
00:21:43.147 --> 00:21:44.248
Kim Yong Chul,

261
00:21:44.917 --> 00:21:46.317
I understand your pain.

262
00:21:46.788 --> 00:21:50.587
But you do not know what pain is like...

263
00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:54.298
because you can't feel anything.

264
00:21:56.058 --> 00:21:58.698
You even killed people that the society doesn't care about,

265
00:21:58.698 --> 00:22:00.738
that are without rights,

266
00:22:00.738 --> 00:22:02.367
and forgotten by others.

267
00:22:03.367 --> 00:22:06.708
You murdered such people.

268
00:22:08.038 --> 00:22:10.107
That's your problem.

269
00:22:10.607 --> 00:22:13.048
Can't you think simply?

270
00:22:15.718 --> 00:22:18.548
Chief Director Baek San understood me.

271
00:22:19.317 --> 00:22:20.718
But then,

272
00:22:21.488 --> 00:22:24.587
he's the type that pushes his luck.

273
00:22:38.137 --> 00:22:39.238
I told you.

274
00:22:40.008 --> 00:22:42.708
I'll get to walk out of here on my own accord.

275
00:22:44.278 --> 00:22:45.677
But don't you want to know...

276
00:22:46.177 --> 00:22:49.048
what's inside the bag that belongs to a psychopath?

277
00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:50.647
What is this?

278
00:22:52.188 --> 00:22:56.458
This is my ticket to get me out of here.

279
00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:17.677
Are you disappointed...

280
00:23:17.907 --> 00:23:20.877
that it's Son Suk Ju, and not Baek San?

281
00:23:21.748 --> 00:23:23.788
You psychopath!

282
00:23:23.788 --> 00:23:25.548
Wait, wait.

283
00:23:28.788 --> 00:23:31.258
I have something I have to check on.

284
00:23:35.127 --> 00:23:36.528
It's breaking news.

285
00:23:36.528 --> 00:23:40.897
A shocking report has come in to YTB News.

286
00:23:41.167 --> 00:23:44.468
The anonymous informer sent us a video...

287
00:23:44.468 --> 00:23:47.038
of five youths being confined.

288
00:23:47.038 --> 00:23:49.938
He claimed that if the students are not rescued in time,

289
00:23:49.938 --> 00:23:52.607
all of them will die.

290
00:23:53.077 --> 00:23:55.417
According to an expert analysist...

291
00:23:55.417 --> 00:23:58.087
Let's see how much time we have left.

292
00:23:58.087 --> 00:23:59.288
It was confirmed.

293
00:24:01.558 --> 00:24:03.788
Shall we start over again?

294
00:24:06.288 --> 00:24:08.758
We're getting countless calls at the studio...

295
00:24:08.758 --> 00:24:11.228
from the viewers that just watched the breaking news.

296
00:24:11.228 --> 00:24:13.738
It is said that a child of a powerful politician...

297
00:24:13.738 --> 00:24:15.998
is among the five hostages,

298
00:24:15.998 --> 00:24:18.038
making the situation even bigger.

299
00:24:21.577 --> 00:24:23.077
Should we make a move first?

300
00:24:24.407 --> 00:24:25.407
No.

301
00:24:25.877 --> 00:24:26.948
Stand by for now.

302
00:24:27.448 --> 00:24:28.448
Okay.

303
00:24:31.847 --> 00:24:32.847
Yes?

304
00:24:33.448 --> 00:24:34.758
The situation doesn't look good.

305
00:24:35.317 --> 00:24:36.617
We're trapped in here!

306
00:24:36.617 --> 00:24:38.728
- Save us! - Help!

307
00:24:42.927 --> 00:24:44.468
- Help us! - Help!

308
00:24:44.468 --> 00:24:45.827
Help!

309
00:24:47.137 --> 00:24:48.597
Help!

310
00:24:48.597 --> 00:24:50.907
- Help. - Hurry...

311
00:24:52.038 --> 00:24:53.038
Move.

312
00:24:55.208 --> 00:24:56.208
Move.

313
00:25:03.817 --> 00:25:05.188
Well, Kang Ki Hyung.

314
00:25:06.688 --> 00:25:09.087
Do you feel like talking now?

315
00:25:09.688 --> 00:25:10.688
Tell me.

316
00:25:12.288 --> 00:25:14.028
What is it that you want?

317
00:25:21.097 --> 00:25:23.337
He wants to go in Team Manager Kang's car.

318
00:25:23.768 --> 00:25:26.907
He'll tell us where the kids are...

319
00:25:27.038 --> 00:25:28.377
once we get to the place he wants.

320
00:25:28.438 --> 00:25:30.478
He might have a scheme.

321
00:25:30.478 --> 00:25:32.448
The kids' lives are at stake.

322
00:25:32.508 --> 00:25:33.577
Just do as he tells us.

323
00:25:33.718 --> 00:25:35.347
Team Manager Kang could be put in danger.

324
00:25:35.347 --> 00:25:36.548
Just go with it for now.

325
00:25:36.718 --> 00:25:38.548
Get the best agents to follow them as a backup.

326
00:26:01.877 --> 00:26:04.308
Nice shot, Chief Commissioner.

327
00:26:15.317 --> 00:26:17.427
If you make a rash move,

328
00:26:17.558 --> 00:26:20.087
the kids might die. Remember that.

329
00:26:24.327 --> 00:26:25.427
Let's go.

330
00:26:34.837 --> 00:26:37.377
I'll contact you soon, so please be on standby.

331
00:26:37.377 --> 00:26:38.377
I will.

332
00:26:43.478 --> 00:26:46.518
Nana, please trace a vehicle for me.

333
00:26:51.387 --> 00:26:54.798
Chief Director Baek is a human, just like you.

334
00:26:55.627 --> 00:26:58.667
He acted all noble and well-mannered,

335
00:26:59.097 --> 00:27:01.867
but he lost his head when it came to his family.

336
00:27:01.867 --> 00:27:03.768
Is that the only thing...

337
00:27:04.107 --> 00:27:05.367
you can do?

338
00:27:07.538 --> 00:27:09.508
You will never beat me.

339
00:27:10.077 --> 00:27:12.478
You'll end up accepting my offer.

340
00:27:14.377 --> 00:27:17.048
You mentioned about the fire at the mental hospital, right?

341
00:27:18.188 --> 00:27:20.988
There's a part you omitted.

342
00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:26.427
Aren't you curious how delighted I was...

343
00:27:26.558 --> 00:27:30.028
while watching the people struggling to survive in the fire?

344
00:27:30.768 --> 00:27:32.028
Don't worry.

345
00:27:32.268 --> 00:27:34.298
You'll get to experience it yourself soon.

346
00:27:41.377 --> 00:27:42.738
Turn right.

347
00:27:46.177 --> 00:27:47.417
Go straight.

348
00:27:57.627 --> 00:27:58.857
Where did the car go?

349
00:28:07.337 --> 00:28:08.637
Hold on, Hyun Jun.

350
00:28:09.597 --> 00:28:11.268
Team Manager Kang's car disappeared.

351
00:28:12.667 --> 00:28:14.137
From where they disappeared...

352
00:28:14.177 --> 00:28:16.407
to underground passages and tunnels,

353
00:28:16.808 --> 00:28:19.978
I'm searching for areas that could lose signals.

354
00:28:20.417 --> 00:28:22.877
But it's been a while since I lost the signal.

355
00:28:23.917 --> 00:28:26.048
I think they're going through this underground passage.

356
00:28:26.048 --> 00:28:27.558
Where could this underground passage...

357
00:28:27.887 --> 00:28:30.958
link to that also do not have signals?

358
00:28:32.488 --> 00:28:33.728
There are three possibilities.

359
00:28:34.627 --> 00:28:36.498
The closest one is...

360
00:28:40.597 --> 00:28:42.397
It's Baejae Tunnel.

361
00:28:42.968 --> 00:28:44.808
It's close to where you are.

362
00:28:49.907 --> 00:28:52.308
Okay, that's enough driving.

363
00:29:05.258 --> 00:29:07.258
On top of the tunnel entrance on a hill,

364
00:29:07.258 --> 00:29:09.758
there is a storage covered with ivy.

365
00:29:10.327 --> 00:29:12.567
It's a meaningful place for me.

366
00:29:13.667 --> 00:29:15.097
Let's look at the time.

367
00:29:17.137 --> 00:29:18.907
You have about five minutes.

368
00:29:19.538 --> 00:29:20.708
You better hurry.

369
00:29:28.218 --> 00:29:30.387
It's too bad we're parting ways like this,

370
00:29:30.887 --> 00:29:32.617
but I'm sure we'll meet again.

371
00:29:53.468 --> 00:29:54.877
He walked out that way.

372
00:29:55.438 --> 00:29:57.607
I'll go check on the children. Go chase the Reaper.

373
00:29:57.607 --> 00:29:58.607
Yes, sir.

374
00:30:30.631 --> 00:30:33.863
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 20 Criminal Minds</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

375
00:31:04.048 --> 00:31:05.177
Help me.

376
00:31:24.397 --> 00:31:25.468
Please.

377
00:31:25.667 --> 00:31:26.927
Help me.

378
00:31:36.677 --> 00:31:37.708
Wake up.

379
00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:40.008
Am I going to die?

380
00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:43.448
Hurry up.

381
00:31:44.417 --> 00:31:45.488
Hurry up.

382
00:32:11.877 --> 00:32:14.478
It looks like liquid smoke used for special effect.

383
00:32:15.417 --> 00:32:18.417
Fortunately, it's harmless.

384
00:32:20.857 --> 00:32:23.657
The Reaper expected the children...

385
00:32:23.857 --> 00:32:26.087
to feel fear in a closed space,

386
00:32:27.397 --> 00:32:29.228
and that they'll fight against themselves.

387
00:33:09.038 --> 00:33:11.607
You guys always do this.

388
00:34:19.467 --> 00:34:20.608
Help me.

389
00:34:21.907 --> 00:34:23.177
Help me.

390
00:34:24.378 --> 00:34:25.648
Help me.

391
00:34:27.018 --> 00:34:28.418
Help me.

392
00:34:29.418 --> 00:34:30.487
Seo Young.

393
00:34:30.648 --> 00:34:31.947
Help me.

394
00:34:32.547 --> 00:34:33.547
Seo Young.

395
00:34:33.547 --> 00:34:35.418
Dad. Dad.

396
00:34:44.068 --> 00:34:45.128
Dad.

397
00:34:46.197 --> 00:34:47.268
Dad.

398
00:34:48.367 --> 00:34:49.438
Seo Young.

399
00:34:50.768 --> 00:34:51.808
- Dad. - Seo Young.

400
00:34:52.967 --> 00:34:54.038
Seo Young.

401
00:34:55.708 --> 00:34:56.737
Seo Young.

402
00:35:01.077 --> 00:35:02.148
Dad.

403
00:35:04.887 --> 00:35:07.358
Dad. I'm scared.

404
00:35:12.788 --> 00:35:16.458
Let's go home now, Seo Young.

405
00:35:16.898 --> 00:35:17.967
Let's go home.

406
00:35:28.637 --> 00:35:31.847
Seo Young, You go first.

407
00:35:32.108 --> 00:35:34.577
I'll catch up with you. Hurry.

408
00:35:45.157 --> 00:35:47.597
Get out, Seo Young. Hurry.

409
00:36:33.068 --> 00:36:34.137
Okay.

410
00:36:48.518 --> 00:36:49.617
Dad...

411
00:36:50.558 --> 00:36:51.657
What about my dad?

412
00:36:52.157 --> 00:36:54.257
We searched every old building...

413
00:36:55.998 --> 00:36:57.327
within the radius of 4km...

414
00:36:58.467 --> 00:37:00.438
from where you were found.

415
00:37:04.838 --> 00:37:05.907
I'll...

416
00:37:07.737 --> 00:37:09.137
find Chief Director for sure.

417
00:37:13.347 --> 00:37:16.318
I got out alone. Alone.

418
00:37:19.047 --> 00:37:20.918
Please save my dad.

419
00:37:21.217 --> 00:37:22.987
Please save my dad.

420
00:37:22.987 --> 00:37:24.887
Please find my dad.

421
00:37:26.657 --> 00:37:28.998
Please find my dad.

422
00:37:33.027 --> 00:37:34.137
Where...

423
00:37:35.097 --> 00:37:36.938
should we start?

424
00:37:38.068 --> 00:37:40.808
We can't catch him with a usual investigation method.

425
00:37:41.708 --> 00:37:43.007
He was aware of tracking...

426
00:37:43.237 --> 00:37:46.447
that he erased his trace completely as he moved.

427
00:37:46.708 --> 00:37:48.177
I know it's the Reaper,

428
00:37:48.818 --> 00:37:51.418
but I can't believe he can do all this alone.

429
00:37:51.947 --> 00:37:53.547
There must be another follower.

430
00:37:54.558 --> 00:37:56.117
To get him,

431
00:37:56.518 --> 00:37:59.088
we must do exactly what the Reaper did,

432
00:37:59.157 --> 00:38:01.157
and attract his followers.

433
00:38:01.558 --> 00:38:04.367
We'll be able to attract the Reaper that way.

434
00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:07.467
I'm sure...

435
00:38:08.568 --> 00:38:10.608
he watched everything at the site.

436
00:38:11.637 --> 00:38:15.438
Team Manager Kang. There's a video delivered to you.

437
00:38:16.308 --> 00:38:17.347
Play it.

438
00:38:45.838 --> 00:38:46.838
What do you think?

439
00:38:47.708 --> 00:38:49.108
Do you like this one?

440
00:38:50.677 --> 00:38:51.777
I think...

441
00:38:52.577 --> 00:38:54.978
that's enough to make a good deal.

442
00:38:55.248 --> 00:38:56.518
What do you want?

443
00:38:57.117 --> 00:38:59.088
You know what I want.

444
00:38:59.418 --> 00:39:02.487
It's simple. Give up on that boy,

445
00:39:02.487 --> 00:39:04.987
and tell the world...

446
00:39:05.657 --> 00:39:07.458
that you'll stop chasing after me.

447
00:39:07.657 --> 00:39:09.027
That you have lost.

448
00:39:09.257 --> 00:39:10.697
That you'll give up now.

449
00:39:11.867 --> 00:39:14.338
If you give up on your petty pride,

450
00:39:15.168 --> 00:39:17.407
Chief Director Baek will survive,

451
00:39:18.838 --> 00:39:20.907
and I'll never appear again.

452
00:39:22.737 --> 00:39:26.047
Don't you think it's a pretty good deal?

453
00:39:28.077 --> 00:39:29.478
I've told you already.

454
00:39:29.978 --> 00:39:33.717
I don't make a deal with a jerk like you.

455
00:39:35.887 --> 00:39:38.288
Is your belief or justice that important?

456
00:39:39.228 --> 00:39:43.427
Only novices care about such things when someone's life...

457
00:39:44.097 --> 00:39:45.967
is at risk.

458
00:39:46.827 --> 00:39:47.838
Kim Yong Chul,

459
00:39:48.398 --> 00:39:50.637
we'll arrest you soon.

460
00:39:51.867 --> 00:39:52.938
Kang Ki Hyung,

461
00:39:54.108 --> 00:39:57.708
the needle in your pocket will stab you soon...

462
00:39:57.978 --> 00:40:00.577
unless you get rid of your arrogant behavior.

463
00:40:01.217 --> 00:40:03.217
You will never win at this game.

464
00:40:03.577 --> 00:40:04.688
Never.

465
00:40:09.268 --> 00:40:10.337
Zoom in.

466
00:40:13.337 --> 00:40:15.407
Find me some personal details on him.

467
00:40:17.117 --> 00:40:18.878
And find out the number of the patrol car.

468
00:40:20.248 --> 00:40:21.248
Sir.

469
00:40:23.518 --> 00:40:26.257
Someone helped him at the church where the third murder happened.

470
00:40:26.487 --> 00:40:27.958
It could have been the Reaper.

471
00:40:28.527 --> 00:40:32.197
The Reaper wanted to destroy our team in the first place.

472
00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:36.328
That means the murders had to be enacted...

473
00:40:36.398 --> 00:40:38.837
just the way it was written in the fan fiction novels.

474
00:40:39.168 --> 00:40:42.808
These criminals had even planned the time of the murder.

475
00:40:43.637 --> 00:40:44.808
That means it was important...

476
00:40:45.277 --> 00:40:48.748
for them to know when we were going to find the bodies.

477
00:40:51.518 --> 00:40:53.277
Do you have anything in mind?

478
00:40:59.858 --> 00:41:01.058
It's not the Reaper.

479
00:41:03.128 --> 00:41:06.458
The person that found Ko Joon Hee's body in the first case.

480
00:41:07.628 --> 00:41:08.697
Do you remember him?

481
00:41:08.728 --> 00:41:11.268
I'm Choi Hyun Jin. I work in the Female and Youth Division.

482
00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:12.697
(Root of Evil)

483
00:41:12.898 --> 00:41:14.608
We found it on the scene.

484
00:41:15.367 --> 00:41:17.777
Are you talking about Detective Choi?

485
00:41:23.148 --> 00:41:25.578
He's not just a supporter.

486
00:41:29.317 --> 00:41:32.317
He was engaged to the Reaper's seventh victim,

487
00:41:32.757 --> 00:41:34.628
Han Ji Won.

488
00:41:35.987 --> 00:41:39.657
You're saying that he was the one that waited at the scene...

489
00:41:39.828 --> 00:41:42.128
for the Reaper to appear, and helped...

490
00:41:42.128 --> 00:41:43.697
Kang Chi Hwan.

491
00:41:44.837 --> 00:41:47.137
He's been acting as his supporter,

492
00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:49.808
so that he could get his revenge on his fiancee.

493
00:41:49.808 --> 00:41:50.808
We're exposed.

494
00:41:55.248 --> 00:41:59.677
(The Night Reaper)

495
00:43:52.128 --> 00:43:54.367
Team Manager Kang, I have something.

496
00:43:54.828 --> 00:43:58.538
A car behind the container has started to move.

497
00:43:58.837 --> 00:43:59.998
Keep an eye on the car.

498
00:44:02.208 --> 00:44:03.677
- Stay still. - Let me go.

499
00:44:04.578 --> 00:44:06.237
You can't catch the Reaper.

500
00:44:06.237 --> 00:44:09.277
You can't catch him with your weak ways.

501
00:44:14.217 --> 00:44:15.387
Shut your mouth.

502
00:44:16.018 --> 00:44:18.387
Although you blame it on the Reaper,

503
00:44:19.117 --> 00:44:20.288
you're just another murderer.

504
00:44:20.288 --> 00:44:22.828
Don't kid yourself. I'm going to kill him myself.

505
00:44:22.828 --> 00:44:24.398
Get a hold of yourself, Choi Hyun Jin.

506
00:44:25.927 --> 00:44:27.728
The Reaper already knew who you are.

507
00:44:28.567 --> 00:44:30.567
He just played you.

508
00:44:42.878 --> 00:44:43.878
Yes, sir.

509
00:44:44.117 --> 00:44:46.887
He was watching us nearby as we expected.

510
00:44:47.348 --> 00:44:50.117
I'll follow him first. You should come right away too.

511
00:44:52.087 --> 00:44:54.628
I'm tracking him through the security footage.

512
00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:56.898
The backup forces are waiting at the headquarters.

513
00:45:17.777 --> 00:45:19.248
This is where...

514
00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:22.987
the mental hospital that Kim Yong Chul set on fire had stood.

515
00:45:23.757 --> 00:45:26.558
He came back to the place where all his pains have started.

516
00:45:26.788 --> 00:45:28.328
Do you think...

517
00:45:28.458 --> 00:45:31.058
he didn't know that we were after Choi Hyun Jin?

518
00:45:32.098 --> 00:45:34.367
Just like we were always tracking him down,

519
00:45:35.098 --> 00:45:37.668
he would have been watching us.

520
00:45:38.337 --> 00:45:39.998
What if he had wanted us...

521
00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:42.038
to come here?

522
00:45:42.038 --> 00:45:44.637
He would try to end everything here.

523
00:45:45.277 --> 00:45:46.677
The chief director is in danger.

524
00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:46.297
I think he just left the room.

525
00:48:23.538 --> 00:48:24.538
Chief Director Baek!

526
00:48:27.038 --> 00:48:28.067
Kim Hyun Jun.

527
00:48:28.567 --> 00:48:29.608
Step back.

528
00:48:36.177 --> 00:48:37.277
Kim Yong Chul.

529
00:48:39.748 --> 00:48:40.987
Stop fooling around.

530
00:48:55.398 --> 00:48:57.938
You're too uptight.

531
00:49:06.808 --> 00:49:09.848
What is it? Was it not fun?

532
00:49:10.148 --> 00:49:11.518
Where is our chief director?

533
00:49:12.418 --> 00:49:13.987
Tell us before I shoot off your head.

534
00:49:13.987 --> 00:49:19.117
If you kill me now, you'll never find him.

535
00:49:19.657 --> 00:49:21.858
Don't put up a show, and just tell me.

536
00:49:22.087 --> 00:49:23.898
He won't be able to last long.

537
00:49:24.858 --> 00:49:27.527
He's in bad shape right now.

538
00:49:28.168 --> 00:49:29.197
All right.

539
00:49:30.837 --> 00:49:32.067
What's next?

540
00:49:34.737 --> 00:49:37.038
Put the guns down first before we talk.

541
00:49:37.907 --> 00:49:39.978
Then we can start negotiating.

542
00:49:51.858 --> 00:49:54.087
Kang Ki Hyung, this is your chance.

543
00:49:55.387 --> 00:49:56.927
If you really want to kill me,

544
00:49:57.797 --> 00:49:59.398
shoot me now.

545
00:50:00.898 --> 00:50:02.927
Do you want me to kill you?

546
00:50:03.398 --> 00:50:05.137
I thought that's what you wanted.

547
00:50:07.867 --> 00:50:09.308
Shoot me, Kang Ki Hyung.

548
00:50:11.237 --> 00:50:12.557
If you don't shoot me now,

549
00:50:12.562 --> 00:50:14.281
you'll regret it forever.

550
00:50:16.348 --> 00:50:17.547
I told you...

551
00:50:18.418 --> 00:50:20.418
that you and I are the same sort.

552
00:50:22.947 --> 00:50:25.018
Of course you'd deny it.

553
00:50:26.058 --> 00:50:27.358
Shut your mouth.

554
00:50:29.188 --> 00:50:31.257
How is that young police doing?

555
00:50:32.228 --> 00:50:35.228
He had such black eyes.

556
00:50:36.567 --> 00:50:38.598
Every time I kill someone with eyes like that,

557
00:50:38.697 --> 00:50:40.808
my heart races.

558
00:50:41.467 --> 00:50:43.407
If I kill that young police...

559
00:50:44.108 --> 00:50:46.378
and rip him to pieces in front of you...

560
00:50:46.378 --> 00:50:47.547
Don't move!

561
00:50:48.578 --> 00:50:49.648
Shoot me.

562
00:50:51.547 --> 00:50:52.677
Go ahead.

563
00:51:21.947 --> 00:51:23.148
Tell us.

564
00:51:24.277 --> 00:51:25.617
Where is he?

565
00:51:50.438 --> 00:51:51.538
You jerk!

566
00:51:51.538 --> 00:51:53.007
Calm down.

567
00:51:55.348 --> 00:51:56.447
Open it.

568
00:51:57.547 --> 00:51:59.378
It might not be what you expected to see.

569
00:52:19.797 --> 00:52:21.268
It's only a start.

570
00:52:36.047 --> 00:52:37.157
Now,

571
00:52:38.058 --> 00:52:40.228
prove to yourselves...

572
00:52:40.527 --> 00:52:42.688
how evil human beings can be.

573
00:52:53.538 --> 00:52:54.567
Sir.

574
00:53:14.788 --> 00:53:16.288
An instinct to survive...

575
00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:19.297
is a common instinct to all animals.

576
00:53:19.927 --> 00:53:23.898
All humans are animals, just like pigs.

577
00:54:04.777 --> 00:54:06.007
Am I wrong?

578
00:54:07.478 --> 00:54:08.677
You jerk!

579
00:54:48.348 --> 00:54:50.958
You should have shot me when I gave you the chance.

580
00:54:52.757 --> 00:54:56.427
I already killed Chief Director Baek.

581
00:54:59.558 --> 00:55:02.328
You're so weak.

582
00:55:02.728 --> 00:55:04.337
Kim Yong Chul!

583
00:55:12.407 --> 00:55:14.578
Shoot. Shoot me.

584
00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.717
Did I tell you?

585
00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:22.748
Out of all the people I've killed...

586
00:55:23.958 --> 00:55:26.418
touching Hae Won's body...

587
00:55:26.828 --> 00:55:28.688
excited me the most.

588
00:55:29.628 --> 00:55:31.458
It was the best.

589
00:55:49.578 --> 00:55:50.677
Team Manager Kang.

590
00:55:52.177 --> 00:55:53.418
Team Manager Kang!

591
00:55:57.783 --> 00:55:59.954
Shoot. Shoot me.

592
00:56:03.624 --> 00:56:05.093
Did I tell you?

593
00:56:05.693 --> 00:56:08.124
Out of all the people I've killed...

594
00:56:09.334 --> 00:56:11.794
touching Hae Won's body...

595
00:56:12.204 --> 00:56:14.064
excited me the most.

596
00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:16.834
It was the best.

597
00:56:34.954 --> 00:56:36.053
Team Manager Kang.

598
00:56:37.553 --> 00:56:38.794
Team Manager Kang!

599
00:58:23.667 --> 00:58:25.567
"The ultimate power and the devil are fighting there."

600
00:58:26.127 --> 00:58:27.567
"The battlefield is..."

601
00:58:28.138 --> 00:58:29.498
"the heart of man."

602
00:58:30.268 --> 00:58:31.437
By Dostoyevsky.

603
00:58:56.235 --> 00:58:57.235
Dad.

604
00:58:57.636 --> 00:59:00.076
Why do waves come and go?

605
00:59:03.036 --> 00:59:04.346
Because it doesn't stagnate.

606
00:59:06.445 --> 00:59:07.775
What does stagnate mean?

607
00:59:09.985 --> 00:59:13.715
It means it's contained in one place for a long time.

608
00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:17.456
Is stagnating bad?

609
00:59:20.395 --> 00:59:21.556
Well...

610
00:59:22.755 --> 00:59:24.395
It could be good...

611
00:59:25.125 --> 00:59:26.936
or bad.

612
00:59:30.005 --> 00:59:32.105
I think it's good.

613
00:59:35.875 --> 00:59:37.246
Why do you think so?

614
00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:40.076
If something stagnates,

615
00:59:40.645 --> 00:59:43.346
it means I can be with it for a long time.

616
00:59:47.456 --> 00:59:48.616
Do you miss your mom?

617
00:59:54.956 --> 00:59:55.956
It's fine.

618
00:59:57.025 --> 01:00:00.536
Your mom will be with us...

619
01:00:01.596 --> 01:00:03.166
in our hearts.

620
01:00:26.726 --> 01:00:28.425
Uncle. Aunt.

621
01:00:34.565 --> 01:00:42.576
(Thank you for watching Criminal Minds.)
