1
00:00:01.382 --> 00:00:03.052
(One Night Two Days)

2
00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:05.613
(Hot summer has passed.)

3
00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:07.944
(And there's a cooler breeze now.)

4
00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:10.954
(Leaves turn red and yellow.)

5
00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:13.753
(Cosmos blooms in our front yards.)

6
00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:14.885
It's now the fall.

7
00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:16.323
Yes, and the fall night deepens.

8
00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:17.925
(Now a fall night deepens.)

9
00:00:18.594 --> 00:00:19.594
(Slapping)

10
00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:22.594
There are insects everywhere.

11
00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:24.295
I know.

12
00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:25.734
Yes, especially mayflies.

13
00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:28.304
One Night Two Days celebrates its...

14
00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:30.064
10-year anniversary this year.

15
00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:32.334
Jong Min has been with the show...

16
00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:33.605
during his 20s, 30s, and 40s.

17
00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:35.803
- Is that so?
- Yes.

18
00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:38.145
- I started in my 20s.
- Are you already 40?

19
00:00:38.244 --> 00:00:39.413
No, I'm 39.

20
00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.585
It'll be true if the
show airs next year too.

21
00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:45.154
Anyway, the show was able to air...

22
00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:47.685
for such a long time...

23
00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.824
thanks to the love and support...

24
00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:52.655
- of our viewers.
- I agree.

25
00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:55.224
The viewers of our show
aren't like the others.

26
00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:56.965
I had time to think about it.

27
00:00:57.134 --> 00:00:59.265
Most viewers watch shows
because they're fun,

28
00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:02.305
but our viewers tune into our show...

29
00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:04.404
like a habit almost every week.

30
00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:06.173
I agree with what Dong Gu said.

31
00:01:06.174 --> 00:01:07.304
Sometimes, it wasn't funny.

32
00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:08.503
- Of course.
- For many episodes.

33
00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:09.804
Even when it was...

34
00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:11.214
- They were loyal.
- Exactly!

35
00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:13.143
- They were loyal viewers.
- Yes, loyal.

36
00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:16.484
But many still want us
to shut down production.

37
00:01:16.614 --> 00:01:17.654
(A harsh fact)

38
00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:19.884
We should face reality.

39
00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:21.054
(He speaks ill of their own show.)

40
00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:23.154
I'd like to take this opportunity...

41
00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:24.555
to bow down to our viewers.

42
00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:26.294
I agree.

43
00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:28.964
You've been with the show for 10 years.

44
00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.635
So say you're grateful
and we'll bow with you.

45
00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:35.404
We didn't make it this far because of...

46
00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:36.935
what we did on the show.

47
00:01:37.374 --> 00:01:40.944
We owe it to all the viewers...

48
00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:42.174
who adored us dearly.

49
00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:44.973
We wish to be in your good graces...

50
00:01:44.974 --> 00:01:46.474
for 10 more years to come.

51
00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:47.685
Thank you.

52
00:01:47.844 --> 00:01:49.644
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

53
00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:54.123
Airing for 10 years is
an incredible milestone.

54
00:01:54.124 --> 00:01:56.084
Thank you so much.

55
00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:58.124
You shouldn't sneak glances while bowing.

56
00:01:58.754 --> 00:01:59.794
(Giggling)

57
00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:01.295
- All right.
- Let's have a seat.

58
00:02:01.564 --> 00:02:04.893
To say thank you to our viewers today,

59
00:02:04.894 --> 00:02:07.135
we will look back on the 10 years...

60
00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:09.463
of One Night Two Days.

61
00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:10.703
The 10 years?

62
00:02:10.704 --> 00:02:12.304
- Here you go.
- We went to many places.

63
00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:13.643
It's a single card.

64
00:02:13.644 --> 00:02:15.574
- The pilot episode.
- The pilot?

65
00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:18.143
- Well...
- This you should know.

66
00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:20.143
- Jong Min, come on.
- This you should know.

67
00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:21.845
- What was the season?
- What year was it?

68
00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:24.483
- This is what I remember.
- 10 years ago, of course.

69
00:02:24.484 --> 00:02:27.023
The opening took place at a toll gate.

70
00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:29.584
It was also a very hot day.

71
00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:32.453
(They first met the viewers...)

72
00:02:32.454 --> 00:02:35.165
(on a hot summer day in 2007.)

73
00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:36.863
One Night...

74
00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:39.195
(Thanks to your constant
love and support, )

75
00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:40.733
- Two Days.
- Two Days.

76
00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:44.904
(we're still with you on this very day.)

77
00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:47.143
The number of locations
we visited add up to...

78
00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:48.244
I wonder how many.

79
00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.945
151 places.

80
00:02:51.674 --> 00:02:53.444
- 151?
- We also went to...

81
00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:56.515
- places multiple times.
- My gosh, 151.

82
00:02:56.684 --> 00:02:59.984
(We welcomed warm spring 10 times.)

83
00:03:00.554 --> 00:03:03.285
(We felt the vibrant energy of summer.)

84
00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:05.755
(In the fall too, )

85
00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:09.864
(we visited Korea's exquisite beauty.)

86
00:03:10.165 --> 00:03:11.765
When did we have so many guests?

87
00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:15.733
223 people joined us on our trips.

88
00:03:15.734 --> 00:03:16.875
Really?
- 223 people?

89
00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:19.234
How come I only remember Han Hyo Joo?

90
00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:21.945
(In Tae Hyun's memories, )

91
00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.644
(only Hyo Joo's smile from
last spring remains.)

92
00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:29.144
- Not you guys too.
- No, it's someone else.

93
00:03:29.244 --> 00:03:30.854
- Who?
- Park Shin Hye.

94
00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:32.554
We had to jump to see her.

95
00:03:33.855 --> 00:03:36.324
(She who made their morning brighter)

96
00:03:36.325 --> 00:03:38.894
(Morning fairy, Park Shin Hye)

97
00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:42.464
(How could you be sleepy
after a glimpse of her?)

98
00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:44.863
- There was Suzy.
- And Sae Kyeong.

99
00:03:44.864 --> 00:03:46.064
- Hyun A too.
- Right.

100
00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:47.625
Don't you want to go back to that time?

101
00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:51.704
(Suzy was the first morning fairy.)

102
00:03:52.605 --> 00:03:55.304
(She even cooked them an early breakfast.)

103
00:03:56.744 --> 00:03:59.714
(She woke them up by playing the piano.)

104
00:04:00.184 --> 00:04:02.785
(Morning fairy Sae Kyeong)

105
00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:08.683
(Sometimes they gave the
members butterflies.)

106
00:04:08.684 --> 00:04:11.225
(Sometimes they brought them laughter.)

107
00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:14.495
(How can love fade away?)

108
00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:16.565
(Follow me!)

109
00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:17.963
Follow me!

110
00:04:17.964 --> 00:04:20.065
(They let go of all inhibitions...)

111
00:04:20.704 --> 00:04:23.474
(which we are grateful for.)

112
00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:24.904
No way!

113
00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:27.603
150 crew members help with...

114
00:04:27.604 --> 00:04:29.204
the production of the show.

115
00:04:29.675 --> 00:04:30.675
150?

116
00:04:30.676 --> 00:04:34.244
Does that include those
who edit the scenes?

117
00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:36.343
- Yes, everyone.
- I see.

118
00:04:36.344 --> 00:04:38.014
Joon Ho was first to buy them dinner...

119
00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:39.484
when he won the Grand Award.

120
00:04:39.485 --> 00:04:40.554
It cost me about three big ones.

121
00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:41.555
- Kim Joon Ho.
- Kim Joon Ho!

122
00:04:41.556 --> 00:04:43.384
(Joon Ho bought dinner...)

123
00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:45.195
(after winning the 2013 KBS Grand Award.)

124
00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:50.094
(It included all the
staff and the members.)

125
00:04:52.034 --> 00:04:54.505
(What he had to pay was through the roof.)

126
00:04:54.534 --> 00:04:57.234
You have to buy pork and
twice the amount of beef.

127
00:04:57.235 --> 00:04:59.634
- Eel too.
- That you buy the most.

128
00:04:59.635 --> 00:05:01.444
We should start a private fund.

129
00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:03.744
He's right about starting one.

130
00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:06.885
- We need insurance.
- Yes, exactly.

131
00:05:07.315 --> 00:05:09.543
It's actually quite scary to win an award.

132
00:05:09.544 --> 00:05:11.713
- Of course.
- We'll be in the red.

133
00:05:11.714 --> 00:05:12.754
Right.

134
00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:14.554
The numbers show that we have made history.

135
00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:16.485
I'm sure we brought back many memories.

136
00:05:17.024 --> 00:05:19.523
To commemorate our 10-year anniversary,

137
00:05:19.524 --> 00:05:21.994
we asked the viewers...

138
00:05:21.995 --> 00:05:23.765
a few questions on our website.

139
00:05:24.935 --> 00:05:27.834
(The 10-year Anniversary Survey)

140
00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:31.575
(Viewers replied with
many ideas and comments.)

141
00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:35.603
Who here participated or saw the questions?

142
00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:36.724
I did see it on the website.

143
00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:38.374
- Really?
- Yes, but...

144
00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:42.084
I couldn't find the link
although I tried twice.

145
00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:44.413
- He's bad with computers.
- Right.

146
00:05:44.414 --> 00:05:46.283
- I used my cell phone.
- It should've worked.

147
00:05:46.284 --> 00:05:48.283
- That's not it.
- He's bad with this.

148
00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:50.394
He should get himself a private tutor.

149
00:05:51.794 --> 00:05:53.394
We made sure that it could be accessed.

150
00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:55.694
- So there was a survey.
- Right.

151
00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:58.494
We asked the viewers to vote on a ranking.

152
00:05:58.495 --> 00:05:59.695
One of the questions was this.

153
00:05:59.894 --> 00:06:03.365
"What is the word that sums up the show?"

154
00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:05.074
- Our roulette games.
- Of course.

155
00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:06.674
- Yes, our games.
- I agree.

156
00:06:06.675 --> 00:06:08.304
That has to be it.

157
00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:10.344
(Their games based on chance ranked first.)

158
00:06:10.675 --> 00:06:13.074
The game that I remember the most...

159
00:06:13.075 --> 00:06:15.885
is the one we did in Chinatown.

160
00:06:16.284 --> 00:06:18.014
- Right.
- Of course!

161
00:06:18.015 --> 00:06:20.754
I almost had a heart attack.

162
00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.695
Joo Hyuk even said that
he'd leave the show.

163
00:06:24.755 --> 00:06:26.031
(One team was to go home early.)

164
00:06:26.055 --> 00:06:27.124
Let's go!

165
00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:29.995
(The suspense almost killed them that day.)

166
00:06:30.094 --> 00:06:31.164
Which team is it?

167
00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:34.204
(Sleeping outdoors)

168
00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:37.075
(The joy was double the size.)

169
00:06:39.935 --> 00:06:41.174
(The other team slept...)

170
00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:43.005
(where the marathon was to take place.)

171
00:06:44.044 --> 00:06:46.015
The one I remember...

172
00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:47.884
was the big ladder game we played.

173
00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:50.283
- We'd follow the lines.
- Oh, that one.

174
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:51.644
We had to immediately take a dive.

175
00:06:52.685 --> 00:06:53.754
I was the unlucky one that day.

176
00:06:53.755 --> 00:06:55.024
- Right.
- Of course.

177
00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:57.854
(On the 1-year anniversary of Season 3)

178
00:06:59.154 --> 00:07:01.523
(They failed their mission, )

179
00:07:01.524 --> 00:07:03.735
(so 2 had to take a dive in the water.)

180
00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:07.305
(Joon Young was selected.)

181
00:07:08.765 --> 00:07:11.104
(It was a cold winter day.)

182
00:07:11.704 --> 00:07:16.005
(Joon Young was the unlucky one.)

183
00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:21.115
- Good job.
- Goodness.

184
00:07:21.385 --> 00:07:22.783
In me and Joon Ho's case...

185
00:07:22.784 --> 00:07:23.814
- The octopus fishing.
- Exactly.

186
00:07:23.815 --> 00:07:24.953
(The horrifying octopus fishing)

187
00:07:24.954 --> 00:07:27.684
I remember the game being difficult too.

188
00:07:27.685 --> 00:07:28.924
(Yangjangpi)

189
00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:30.624
(4 years ago, someone else was...)

190
00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:33.394
(also unlucky on a winter day.)

191
00:07:34.894 --> 00:07:38.534
(Thankfully, he wasn't flying solo.)

192
00:07:38.964 --> 00:07:40.033
I wasn't going to say this but...

193
00:07:40.034 --> 00:07:44.175
(Jong Min sought out his fishing partner.)

194
00:07:45.834 --> 00:07:46.973
- Your sister...
- We get it.

195
00:07:46.974 --> 00:07:50.675
(He was ungrateful to
Joon Ho even though...)

196
00:07:51.714 --> 00:07:55.115
(Joon Ho hosted his sister's wedding.)

197
00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:56.414
How could you?

198
00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.454
(Joon Ho collapsed out of frustration.)

199
00:08:00.385 --> 00:08:01.425
Gosh!

200
00:08:02.485 --> 00:08:05.523
(The two went through quite an ordeal...)

201
00:08:05.524 --> 00:08:08.565
(4 years ago on a winter day.)

202
00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:10.664
Oh no.

203
00:08:10.964 --> 00:08:12.094
Dong Gu, what about you?

204
00:08:12.334 --> 00:08:15.234
Dong Gu has only himself to blame.

205
00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:16.365
That's true.

206
00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:18.773
Why are you good at beating me though?

207
00:08:18.774 --> 00:08:21.473
I haven't said this before,

208
00:08:21.474 --> 00:08:23.514
but as an actor, I had to watch what I ate.

209
00:08:23.515 --> 00:08:26.213
I didn't want to look bloated...

210
00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.314
on set the next day.

211
00:08:27.315 --> 00:08:29.215
But I always win when I'm on your team.

212
00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:32.084
- So it was damaging.
- I didn't want to eat,

213
00:08:32.085 --> 00:08:34.124
but I always won when I'm on your team.

214
00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:35.724
You're nothing but a meal to him.

215
00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:37.053
He thinks of you as that.

216
00:08:37.054 --> 00:08:39.354
To him, your name is Gimbap.

217
00:08:39.355 --> 00:08:40.765
I'm like a tasty gimbap.

218
00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:43.594
Gosh.

219
00:08:43.595 --> 00:08:45.393
Let me ask you another.

220
00:08:45.394 --> 00:08:48.564
Which is the best location
we've ever been to?

221
00:08:48.765 --> 00:08:50.704
- Harbin.
- The ice lantern...

222
00:08:50.705 --> 00:08:51.734
festival was amazing.

223
00:08:51.735 --> 00:08:54.705
The Ahn Jung Geun Tour we went on...

224
00:08:55.074 --> 00:08:56.774
had a great impact.

225
00:08:57.314 --> 00:08:59.574
(They visited Harbin last winter.)

226
00:09:00.544 --> 00:09:04.355
(It looked like the castle from "Frozen".)

227
00:09:05.784 --> 00:09:08.624
(There they encountered...)

228
00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:14.265
(Ahn Jung Geun's footsteps.)

229
00:09:14.924 --> 00:09:16.394
It's exactly 10 steps.

230
00:09:17.365 --> 00:09:20.964
(They felt his breaths...)

231
00:09:20.965 --> 00:09:26.034
(as they ruminated on the meaning.)

232
00:09:28.605 --> 00:09:34.714
(The series moved the
viewers as well as...)

233
00:09:34.715 --> 00:09:37.154
(the member of One Night Two Days.)

234
00:09:39.985 --> 00:09:44.053
My favorite place is where we ate lunch...

235
00:09:44.054 --> 00:09:47.023
- on the Jong Min Special.
- It was incredible.

236
00:09:47.024 --> 00:09:48.923
- I mean...
- Of course!

237
00:09:48.924 --> 00:09:51.264
The day you got angry over a cucumber.

238
00:09:51.265 --> 00:09:53.335
- It was because of him.
- "Jong Min, put it down."

239
00:09:53.735 --> 00:09:55.303
(They went to Boriam hermitage...)

240
00:09:55.304 --> 00:09:57.033
(on the Jong Min Special.)

241
00:09:57.034 --> 00:09:58.034
What a view!

242
00:09:58.475 --> 00:10:00.174
(There we saw...)

243
00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:02.744
(a different side to Jong Min.)

244
00:10:02.745 --> 00:10:04.143
- What is it?
- Why are you eating?

245
00:10:04.144 --> 00:10:05.215
They let me.

246
00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:09.544
(They helped Jong Min eat
at least something.)

247
00:10:09.644 --> 00:10:10.855
- Good.
- Gosh.

248
00:10:11.115 --> 00:10:12.885
(Director Yoo didn't allow it...)

249
00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:15.523
(and Jong Min got angry
for the first time.)

250
00:10:15.524 --> 00:10:17.793
- The view was incredible.
- I know.

251
00:10:17.794 --> 00:10:19.653
Don't you remember the cliff?

252
00:10:19.654 --> 00:10:21.464
- That's right.
- Is where...

253
00:10:21.465 --> 00:10:23.994
we went diving in Ulleungdo?

254
00:10:23.995 --> 00:10:25.563
Yes, that place.

255
00:10:25.564 --> 00:10:27.563
I hear that the place became popular...

256
00:10:27.564 --> 00:10:28.834
after our show aired.

257
00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:31.073
- That's right.
- Joon Ho didn't jump.

258
00:10:31.074 --> 00:10:33.074
- That's right.
- We should go again.

259
00:10:34.505 --> 00:10:41.015
(Ulleungdo, the place of
extraordinary beauty)

260
00:10:43.855 --> 00:10:46.284
(They enjoyed jumping off a cliff.)

261
00:10:47.524 --> 00:10:51.495
(The two chickens couldn't move an inch.)

262
00:10:52.924 --> 00:10:56.124
(Maybe they will this summer though.)

263
00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.393
What came in first place?

264
00:10:57.394 --> 00:11:00.033
- Mount Baekdu?
- That must be it.

265
00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.404
- Mount Baekdu.
- I guess you're right.

266
00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:04.204
In first place is Mount Baekdu.

267
00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.604
- That's right.
- Of course.

268
00:11:05.605 --> 00:11:06.673
It had to be that.

269
00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:09.573
They poured in water from Jeju Island.

270
00:11:09.574 --> 00:11:10.745
We're almost there.

271
00:11:11.414 --> 00:11:13.944
(9 years ago, they visited Mount Baekdu.)

272
00:11:14.745 --> 00:11:16.714
(It was particularly moving...)

273
00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:19.284
(since it's not easily reachable.)

274
00:11:20.885 --> 00:11:23.053
(They brought water from Dokdo, )

275
00:11:23.054 --> 00:11:25.194
(the island on the far end of the east.)

276
00:11:27.524 --> 00:11:30.235
(Water from Baengnyeongdo was also added.)

277
00:11:30.465 --> 00:11:31.563
Mix in with the rest!

278
00:11:31.564 --> 00:11:36.304
(It was our wish to see
all of it become one.)

279
00:11:37.105 --> 00:11:39.403
And now we begin...

280
00:11:39.404 --> 00:11:41.475
the One Night Two Days Awards.

281
00:11:41.804 --> 00:11:44.074
- An award ceremony?
- Is there a Grand Award?

282
00:11:44.174 --> 00:11:45.244
He will have to buy dinner.

283
00:11:45.245 --> 00:11:46.884
The one with the most awards...

284
00:11:46.885 --> 00:11:47.944
can be the winner.

285
00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:50.014
- That's a good idea.
- So today...

286
00:11:50.015 --> 00:11:51.153
He'll buy us beef right after the shoot.

287
00:11:51.154 --> 00:11:52.214
(The winner will buy beef!)

288
00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:53.683
- Okay.
- Got it.

289
00:11:53.684 --> 00:11:55.153
- Beef.
- That includes...

290
00:11:55.154 --> 00:11:56.823
the previous members of the show.

291
00:11:56.824 --> 00:11:58.094
Of course.

292
00:11:58.095 --> 00:11:59.725
We should contact them.

293
00:12:00.524 --> 00:12:01.725
In 1, 2, 3.

294
00:12:02.324 --> 00:12:04.063
- Hold on.
- Are you insane?

295
00:12:04.064 --> 00:12:05.563
(One Night Two Days Awards)

296
00:12:05.564 --> 00:12:07.124
(They will guess who topped the chart.)

297
00:12:08.635 --> 00:12:09.734
(For a correct answer, a
snack will be given.)

298
00:12:09.735 --> 00:12:10.803
Jong Min, oh no.

299
00:12:10.804 --> 00:12:12.635
I think we'll be eating beef today.

300
00:12:12.674 --> 00:12:15.245
We're all getting a bite to eat!

301
00:12:16.105 --> 00:12:19.544
(Best late night snacks are prepared.)

302
00:12:20.485 --> 00:12:22.514
(Wouldn't you like a bite too?)

303
00:12:22.515 --> 00:12:24.014
One Night Two Days Awards.

304
00:12:24.015 --> 00:12:25.355
Here's the first category.

305
00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:27.824
It's the Most Handsome Award.

306
00:12:29.654 --> 00:12:30.934
Should we stay objective or not?

307
00:12:30.995 --> 00:12:34.563
I really don't know how
to answer this question.

308
00:12:34.564 --> 00:12:36.293
The candidates were you...

309
00:12:36.294 --> 00:12:37.794
and everyone from the past seasons.

310
00:12:38.465 --> 00:12:41.765
If only I participated in the survey!

311
00:12:42.635 --> 00:12:43.705
Right.

312
00:12:44.534 --> 00:12:46.004
I already wrote down a name.

313
00:12:46.005 --> 00:12:47.105
I wrote it down.

314
00:12:47.544 --> 00:12:48.804
You can't write your own name.

315
00:12:49.274 --> 00:12:51.745
Should we be considering Joo Hyuk?

316
00:12:52.274 --> 00:12:53.584
Come on.

317
00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:56.115
- Of course not.
- Even I'm better looking.

318
00:12:56.444 --> 00:12:58.755
Joo Hyuk's closer to a squid.

319
00:12:59.515 --> 00:13:00.884
(Joo Hyuk, the squid)

320
00:13:00.885 --> 00:13:02.283
I haven't said this before,

321
00:13:02.284 --> 00:13:04.225
but he's even beneath me.

322
00:13:05.054 --> 00:13:06.471
(Joo Hyuk gets squashed
by the three menaces.)

323
00:13:06.495 --> 00:13:08.264
Please keep in mind...

324
00:13:08.265 --> 00:13:10.023
the fans of the candidates.

325
00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:12.465
Of course. It can only be one person.

326
00:13:12.965 --> 00:13:14.734
No one can beat him.

327
00:13:14.735 --> 00:13:15.933
- Of course.
- Most Handsome Award.

328
00:13:15.934 --> 00:13:16.934
Write it down.

329
00:13:17.975 --> 00:13:19.434
I know I have it right.

330
00:13:20.904 --> 00:13:22.304
Stop peeking!

331
00:13:22.475 --> 00:13:24.073
- That's not it.
- You were looking.

332
00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:26.515
No one can argue with the winner.

333
00:13:26.814 --> 00:13:28.783
- All right. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

334
00:13:28.784 --> 00:13:30.354
- There.
- It's Lee Seung Gi.

335
00:13:30.355 --> 00:13:32.985
- Of course it is.
- He wrote Dong Gu down.

336
00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:35.923
- No way.
- Really?

337
00:13:35.924 --> 00:13:37.393
He's the most recent member.

338
00:13:37.394 --> 00:13:38.823
Out of everyone on the show,

339
00:13:38.824 --> 00:13:40.424
- he had the most fans.
- Of course.

340
00:13:40.524 --> 00:13:42.994
Also, everyone liked him
regardless of their age.

341
00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:46.903
The impact he had was incredible.

342
00:13:46.904 --> 00:13:50.573
Why was Joo Hyuk not
even considered though?

343
00:13:50.574 --> 00:13:52.273
- Stop that.
- It can't be him.

344
00:13:52.274 --> 00:13:55.073
To me, Joo Hyuk's a top celebrity.

345
00:13:55.074 --> 00:13:56.944
Then why didn't you write down his name?

346
00:13:57.274 --> 00:13:58.434
It's because I wanted to eat.

347
00:13:59.174 --> 00:14:00.384
See?

348
00:14:00.385 --> 00:14:01.985
Let's see his infamous video once again.

349
00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:04.053
Cue!

350
00:14:04.054 --> 00:14:05.313
Kill the dog...

351
00:14:05.314 --> 00:14:08.324
(Kill the dog even when
the hunting isn't over.)

352
00:14:09.755 --> 00:14:11.794
What does that even mean?

353
00:14:12.355 --> 00:14:13.675
(Stand in the corner over there!)

354
00:14:14.894 --> 00:14:17.164
(Him saying the proverb
wrong was legendary.)

355
00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:19.095
Five of you wrote Lee Seung Gi,

356
00:14:19.534 --> 00:14:21.334
while Joon Young wrote Dong Gu.

357
00:14:21.335 --> 00:14:22.903
I just badly wanted to eat.

358
00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.033
That is most important.

359
00:14:24.034 --> 00:14:25.634
- 5th?
- Who do you think...

360
00:14:25.635 --> 00:14:27.774
- came in 5th?
- Could it be one of us?

361
00:14:28.074 --> 00:14:29.644
- Is it Defconn?
- Or Joon Ho?

362
00:14:30.674 --> 00:14:31.944
It's Kim Joo Hyuk.

363
00:14:32.875 --> 00:14:34.144
It's Kim Joo Hyuk.

364
00:14:34.985 --> 00:14:35.985
No way!

365
00:14:36.444 --> 00:14:39.355
See? What did I tell you?

366
00:14:40.085 --> 00:14:41.245
So Joo Hyuk's in fifth place.

367
00:14:41.784 --> 00:14:43.995
- Gosh.
- Congratulations.

368
00:14:44.424 --> 00:14:45.754
Congratulations. Anyway,

369
00:14:45.755 --> 00:14:48.324
we can say that we beat him then.

370
00:14:48.424 --> 00:14:49.663
Of course.

371
00:14:49.664 --> 00:14:51.234
I'm sure we rank above him.

372
00:14:51.235 --> 00:14:52.765
Now for the fourth place.

373
00:14:53.235 --> 00:14:55.403
- What about Tae Hyun?
- It should be...

374
00:14:55.404 --> 00:14:56.563
one of us.

375
00:14:56.564 --> 00:14:58.073
In fourth place is Joon Young.

376
00:14:58.074 --> 00:14:59.504
(Fourth place, Jung Joon Young)

377
00:14:59.505 --> 00:15:01.143
You're better looking than Joo Hyuk!

378
00:15:01.144 --> 00:15:02.674
You should be happy.

379
00:15:03.174 --> 00:15:04.674
- Congratulations.
- Above me are...

380
00:15:05.074 --> 00:15:08.085
Dong Gu, Lee Seung Gi, and Joo Won.

381
00:15:09.485 --> 00:15:10.854
What?

382
00:15:10.855 --> 00:15:12.514
I guess I should be happy then.

383
00:15:12.515 --> 00:15:14.023
- You're handsome.
- Congratulations.

384
00:15:14.024 --> 00:15:15.664
- You're good looking.
- Congratulations.

385
00:15:15.725 --> 00:15:17.553
You still beat a lot of people.

386
00:15:17.554 --> 00:15:19.554
- That's a relief.
- You beat at least 15.

387
00:15:19.824 --> 00:15:21.694
In third place is...

388
00:15:21.995 --> 00:15:24.063
- Is it Tae Hyun?
- He's looking at Dong Gu.

389
00:15:24.064 --> 00:15:25.904
Is it Dong Gu? He's looking
in this direction.

390
00:15:26.465 --> 00:15:27.785
(They're the handsome ones here.)

391
00:15:28.064 --> 00:15:29.865
Is it me?

392
00:15:31.674 --> 00:15:33.135
Why are you looking at me?

393
00:15:33.205 --> 00:15:34.704
- He was looking at me.
- No, me.

394
00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:36.244
No, me!

395
00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:37.544
You two probably came in last.

396
00:15:38.345 --> 00:15:40.845
- In third place is...
- Hurry up already.

397
00:15:41.885 --> 00:15:43.014
It's Dong Gu.

398
00:15:43.015 --> 00:15:44.454
(3rd place, Yoon Dong Gu)

399
00:15:44.455 --> 00:15:46.313
- There you go.
- He's not in first place.

400
00:15:46.314 --> 00:15:47.885
This isn't at all fun.

401
00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:51.955
- Of course it's him.
- Thank you.

402
00:15:51.995 --> 00:15:54.564
Anyone can tell that he's handsome.

403
00:15:55.095 --> 00:15:56.365
- That I guarantee.
- Gosh.

404
00:15:56.694 --> 00:15:57.974
Will I be the only one left out?

405
00:15:58.534 --> 00:16:02.664
The winner received 24
percent of the votes.

406
00:16:02.934 --> 00:16:04.234
It's Eun Ji Won.

407
00:16:04.235 --> 00:16:05.875
- What?
- Thank goodness.

408
00:16:06.274 --> 00:16:07.474
- He's in first place?
- Gosh.

409
00:16:07.644 --> 00:16:09.504
- What?
- No way.

410
00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:10.574
- Really?
- Are you sure?

411
00:16:10.814 --> 00:16:12.351
Ji Won and I aren't that much different.

412
00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:13.884
This must be a joke.

413
00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:15.813
- Is it really Ji Won?
- He's not a member...

414
00:16:15.814 --> 00:16:16.955
of Sechs Kies for nothing.

415
00:16:17.914 --> 00:16:20.225
(He's forever our leader.)

416
00:16:21.654 --> 00:16:24.424
(Leader Eun is back!)

417
00:16:25.654 --> 00:16:27.063
What do you mean he's just like you?

418
00:16:27.064 --> 00:16:28.164
Say that to his fans.

419
00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:30.163
Go ahead.

420
00:16:30.164 --> 00:16:31.334
His fans already know.

421
00:16:31.335 --> 00:16:32.965
How many votes did Seung Gi get?

422
00:16:33.365 --> 00:16:35.604
He received 21 percent of the votes.

423
00:16:35.605 --> 00:16:37.504
So it was quite close.

424
00:16:37.505 --> 00:16:40.573
The ranking doesn't end
at the top five though.

425
00:16:40.574 --> 00:16:42.844
In 13th place is...
- 13th place?

426
00:16:42.845 --> 00:16:44.745
- Who is it?
- It's Defconn.

427
00:16:45.414 --> 00:16:46.784
- What about Joon Ho?
- Me?

428
00:16:47.485 --> 00:16:48.844
How many are there in total?

429
00:16:48.845 --> 00:16:50.314
- The fans...
- Thank you.

430
00:16:50.515 --> 00:16:52.385
- Thank you.
- Out of how many?

431
00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:54.485
I must've ranked higher than some.

432
00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:55.924
You're 13th out of 13 people.

433
00:16:56.355 --> 00:16:58.324
- I don't think so.
- There are 17 at least.

434
00:16:58.924 --> 00:17:00.053
I at least beat some.

435
00:17:00.054 --> 00:17:02.564
- Gosh.
- I'll keep on going.

436
00:17:03.024 --> 00:17:04.864
In 10th place is...
- 10th place.

437
00:17:05.235 --> 00:17:06.363
It's Kim Joon Ho.

438
00:17:06.364 --> 00:17:08.434
(10th place, Kim Joon Ho)

439
00:17:08.435 --> 00:17:10.204
Thank you so much.

440
00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:12.103
(Laughing boisterously)

441
00:17:12.104 --> 00:17:13.333
At least it's not Jong Min.

442
00:17:13.334 --> 00:17:14.444
I'm in 13th place.

443
00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:16.274
That means you're handsome.

444
00:17:17.415 --> 00:17:18.721
(They're not laughing on the inside.)

445
00:17:18.745 --> 00:17:19.773
Why isn't Tae Hyun on the ranking?

446
00:17:19.774 --> 00:17:22.245
In eighth place is Tae Hyun.

447
00:17:22.485 --> 00:17:23.584
- Finally.
- Gosh.

448
00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:25.254
I knew you'd be on the list.

449
00:17:25.255 --> 00:17:26.824
- Is this a joke?
- Unbelievable.

450
00:17:26.985 --> 00:17:28.583
- Stop messing with me.
- Hold on.

451
00:17:28.584 --> 00:17:30.293
Stop fooling around.

452
00:17:30.294 --> 00:17:32.293
- I knew you'd be called.
- Right.

453
00:17:32.294 --> 00:17:33.424
7th or 8th.

454
00:17:33.425 --> 00:17:36.023
- Is this for real?
- Only Jong Min's left.

455
00:17:36.024 --> 00:17:37.824
- Is he below 10th?
- This is nerve-wracking.

456
00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:39.265
Jong Min...

457
00:17:40.465 --> 00:17:41.665
Jong Min...

458
00:17:45.235 --> 00:17:47.844
(Everyone has a spot on the ranking.)

459
00:17:48.804 --> 00:17:49.944
Jong Min is in seventh place.

460
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:51.714
(7th place, Kim Jong Min)

461
00:17:51.715 --> 00:17:52.915
I lost to Jong Min.

462
00:17:53.645 --> 00:17:55.645
(Tae Hyun is humiliated.)

463
00:17:56.584 --> 00:17:58.255
I'm sorry. I really am.

464
00:17:58.384 --> 00:17:59.415
This can't be.

465
00:17:59.854 --> 00:18:00.954
I'm so sorry.

466
00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:02.584
- Is this a foot?
- Goodness.

467
00:18:02.725 --> 00:18:03.995
Is this a foot on your head?

468
00:18:04.655 --> 00:18:06.094
I'm sorry.

469
00:18:06.695 --> 00:18:08.194
You're Mr. Handsome.

470
00:18:08.195 --> 00:18:10.564
The ranking makes no sense at all.

471
00:18:11.034 --> 00:18:12.863
Some just vote for a funny result.

472
00:18:12.864 --> 00:18:14.363
There are people who do that.

473
00:18:14.364 --> 00:18:16.205
Our viewers are very objective.

474
00:18:17.175 --> 00:18:19.204
- This can't be.
- Look at Tae Hyun.

475
00:18:19.205 --> 00:18:20.874
I'm not sure if you are handsome.

476
00:18:22.475 --> 00:18:24.544
He kind of looks like a fly.

477
00:18:25.044 --> 00:18:28.284
Since no one guessed
correctly in this round,

478
00:18:28.745 --> 00:18:30.583
the food will be untouched.

479
00:18:30.584 --> 00:18:32.284
Can the next round be for two bites?

480
00:18:32.784 --> 00:18:34.255
(Bring it on!)

481
00:18:34.685 --> 00:18:37.553
Next up is the Squid Award.

482
00:18:37.554 --> 00:18:38.994
- What's that?
- The least handsome?

483
00:18:39.024 --> 00:18:40.394
It's the opposite of the previous ranking.

484
00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:42.563
Can I write Yu Hae Jin
when we're not friends?

485
00:18:42.564 --> 00:18:43.964
(Yu Hae Jin has been summoned.)

486
00:18:43.965 --> 00:18:46.033
- How could you?
- I couldn't write that.

487
00:18:46.034 --> 00:18:48.833
Just so you know, I'm a huge fan of his.

488
00:18:48.834 --> 00:18:50.975
- He's not.
- Write it down already.

489
00:18:51.405 --> 00:18:53.273
Hold on a second.

490
00:18:53.274 --> 00:18:54.274
Hurry up.

491
00:18:55.344 --> 00:18:56.584
I can see whose name you wrote.

492
00:18:57.544 --> 00:18:58.645
It's Defconn.

493
00:18:59.274 --> 00:19:00.594
(D in Defconn is easily visible.)

494
00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:03.485
Who wrote my name? Who is it?

495
00:19:04.584 --> 00:19:06.054
This can't be fixed.

496
00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:07.575
You can't all write down one name.

497
00:19:07.755 --> 00:19:10.695
He ranked 13th in the previous ranking.

498
00:19:11.324 --> 00:19:12.394
(Gosh)

499
00:19:12.395 --> 00:19:13.475
- Let's reveal it.
- Oh no.

500
00:19:13.594 --> 00:19:16.165
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Is this really okay?

501
00:19:16.834 --> 00:19:17.834
My gosh.

502
00:19:17.835 --> 00:19:19.965
- Sung Si Kyung?
- Him without the glasses.

503
00:19:24.104 --> 00:19:25.104
Kim Jong Min!

504
00:19:25.105 --> 00:19:27.773
(Tae Hyun still holds a grudge.)

505
00:19:27.774 --> 00:19:29.974
I won't forget that I was humiliated.

506
00:19:29.975 --> 00:19:31.843
Three of you wrote down my name.

507
00:19:31.844 --> 00:19:32.944
Who else can it be?

508
00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:34.915
- Squid of the universe.
- The pig squid.

509
00:19:35.245 --> 00:19:36.584
This is humiliating.

510
00:19:37.455 --> 00:19:39.184
Let's see if there's a twist.

511
00:19:39.185 --> 00:19:40.724
- I won't be in 5th place.
- Here's who's in 5th.

512
00:19:40.725 --> 00:19:41.784
- All right.
- Here it is.

513
00:19:41.925 --> 00:19:42.985
It's the fresh squid.

514
00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:45.554
- Let's say cuttlefish.
- Cuttlefish!

515
00:19:45.624 --> 00:19:46.755
Kim Jong Min.

516
00:19:46.824 --> 00:19:48.024
(What?)

517
00:19:48.524 --> 00:19:50.023
- Really?
- Are you sure?

518
00:19:50.024 --> 00:19:52.094
- What?
- This is insane.

519
00:19:52.834 --> 00:19:54.303
But I was in seventh place earlier.

520
00:19:54.304 --> 00:19:57.634
The ranking earlier was just done for fun.

521
00:19:58.235 --> 00:20:00.204
Jong Min is a cuttlefish.

522
00:20:00.205 --> 00:20:01.674
Who's the baby octopus then?

523
00:20:01.675 --> 00:20:03.315
I'm fine as long as I don't come in last.

524
00:20:03.344 --> 00:20:04.873
- In fourth place is...
- Please.

525
00:20:04.874 --> 00:20:06.373
He is a baby octopus.

526
00:20:06.374 --> 00:20:07.644
- A baby octopus?
- Yes.

527
00:20:07.645 --> 00:20:09.184
- A baby octopus.
- Right.

528
00:20:09.185 --> 00:20:10.254
It's Joon Ho.

529
00:20:10.255 --> 00:20:12.154
(4th place, baby octopus)

530
00:20:12.155 --> 00:20:15.124
- Hold on.
- What did I tell you?

531
00:20:15.255 --> 00:20:16.823
People say that...

532
00:20:16.824 --> 00:20:19.353
I'm handsome for a comedian.

533
00:20:19.354 --> 00:20:21.293
- Look here.
- It's true.

534
00:20:21.294 --> 00:20:24.094
Why don't we make some salted baby octopus?

535
00:20:24.634 --> 00:20:26.294
I've even modeled for magazines.

536
00:20:26.735 --> 00:20:28.063
- Unbelievable.
- Have a seat.

537
00:20:28.064 --> 00:20:29.533
Hi, Mr. Cuttlefish.

538
00:20:29.534 --> 00:20:30.803
Hello there.

539
00:20:30.804 --> 00:20:32.604
This is what makes our show so funny.

540
00:20:33.104 --> 00:20:35.005
In third place is the long-legged octopus.

541
00:20:35.445 --> 00:20:38.113
In third place is Kang Ho Dong.

542
00:20:38.114 --> 00:20:39.745
(3rd place, Kang Ho Dong)

543
00:20:40.044 --> 00:20:42.844
- Of course.
- We're better looking.

544
00:20:42.945 --> 00:20:44.654
You shouldn't say that though.

545
00:20:44.655 --> 00:20:45.814
He's a long-legged octopus.

546
00:20:46.015 --> 00:20:50.824
(3rd place, long-legged octopus)

547
00:20:51.995 --> 00:20:55.294
Hold on. This means I
could be in the top two.

548
00:20:55.864 --> 00:20:56.864
You don't know that.

549
00:20:56.865 --> 00:20:58.564
Please let it be him.

550
00:20:58.735 --> 00:21:02.804
Let me tell you who's in the top two.

551
00:21:03.205 --> 00:21:04.334
It's Defconn.

552
00:21:05.304 --> 00:21:07.844
- And Hae Jin.
- I knew it.

553
00:21:07.874 --> 00:21:10.244
Please.

554
00:21:10.245 --> 00:21:11.313
Oh, no. Stop frowning.

555
00:21:11.314 --> 00:21:13.714
You look like a squid squirming.

556
00:21:13.715 --> 00:21:15.383
Please.

557
00:21:15.384 --> 00:21:16.853
- Please.
- Please.

558
00:21:16.854 --> 00:21:19.514
Please don't make me win first place.

559
00:21:19.515 --> 00:21:21.595
Could you please sit down?
You smell like gochujang.

560
00:21:22.985 --> 00:21:24.024
The winner got...

561
00:21:24.955 --> 00:21:27.593
43 percent of the votes.
- 43 percent?

562
00:21:27.594 --> 00:21:29.593
He won by a landslide.

563
00:21:29.594 --> 00:21:32.395
- Squid Award goes to...
- Please. I don't want it.

564
00:21:33.564 --> 00:21:34.705
Defconn.

565
00:21:36.104 --> 00:21:38.373
(Praise the squid!)

566
00:21:38.374 --> 00:21:40.974
- Squid!
- Squid!

567
00:21:40.975 --> 00:21:42.604
Squid!

568
00:21:43.544 --> 00:21:45.974
(I'm sorry that I'm ugly)

569
00:21:45.975 --> 00:21:46.985
(I'm sorry.)

570
00:21:47.715 --> 00:21:50.214
(I'm sorry that I'm fat and ugly.)

571
00:21:50.215 --> 00:21:51.215
(Stop it!)

572
00:21:51.216 --> 00:21:52.455
What are you doing?

573
00:21:53.255 --> 00:21:54.484
What is this?

574
00:21:54.485 --> 00:21:55.783
(We appreciate your handsome face.)

575
00:21:55.784 --> 00:21:56.995
What on earth are you doing?

576
00:21:58.824 --> 00:22:00.594
Why did you waste money on such a thing?

577
00:22:00.765 --> 00:22:02.665
- What does it say?
- It says "Squid Award".

578
00:22:02.965 --> 00:22:04.195
My goodness.

579
00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:06.664
- Congratulations.
- Squid Award.

580
00:22:06.665 --> 00:22:08.104
Is it shaped after a squid?

581
00:22:08.134 --> 00:22:12.735
I appreciate the viewers' interest in me.

582
00:22:12.804 --> 00:22:14.303
- What a good-looking man.
- Take off your glasses.

583
00:22:14.304 --> 00:22:15.474
Make a bow to the viewers.

584
00:22:15.475 --> 00:22:16.873
All right. Let's take a
picture to celebrate it.

585
00:22:16.874 --> 00:22:19.374
- Please raise your head.
- I love you. 1, 2, 3.

586
00:22:19.415 --> 00:22:20.415
Good.

587
00:22:21.314 --> 00:22:22.583
(1st place, Defconn)

588
00:22:22.584 --> 00:22:23.584
You look like a squid.

589
00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:26.955
Thank you, everyone.

590
00:22:27.324 --> 00:22:28.754
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

591
00:22:28.755 --> 00:22:30.794
That you won 43 percent
of the votes means...

592
00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:33.293
almost half of all Korean citizens...

593
00:22:33.294 --> 00:22:34.524
Don't be so mean to him.

594
00:22:34.594 --> 00:22:36.834
Sometimes when I sleep outdoors,

595
00:22:37.094 --> 00:22:40.204
I find him sleeping next
to me in the morning.

596
00:22:40.205 --> 00:22:42.204
His face without glasses scares me...

597
00:22:42.205 --> 00:22:44.033
because it's so ugly.

598
00:22:44.034 --> 00:22:45.504
(The 2nd attack)

599
00:22:45.505 --> 00:22:47.904
- He's a squid.
- I told you guys already.

600
00:22:47.905 --> 00:22:50.774
Honestly, that being said...

601
00:22:50.915 --> 00:22:53.274
You know, we played "Scrubbing Game" once.

602
00:22:53.314 --> 00:22:55.284
When you were soaked in water...

603
00:22:56.114 --> 00:23:00.685
(His ugliness was very intimidating.)

604
00:23:01.255 --> 00:23:03.124
It's because he was not wearing glasses.

605
00:23:03.554 --> 00:23:05.093
His skin was so pale.

606
00:23:05.094 --> 00:23:06.994
- It was.
- It's so pale.

607
00:23:06.995 --> 00:23:08.995
His skin is as soft as that of babies'.

608
00:23:09.094 --> 00:23:10.394
- It looked very soft.
- Yes.

609
00:23:10.395 --> 00:23:12.495
- But announcers like him.
- You're right.

610
00:23:12.665 --> 00:23:14.834
- Come on.
- Cheer up.

611
00:23:14.905 --> 00:23:18.103
- Thank you.
- I saw on the internet...

612
00:23:18.104 --> 00:23:20.874
that many girls picked
you as their ideal type.

613
00:23:20.975 --> 00:23:22.043
- That's right.
- Right.

614
00:23:22.044 --> 00:23:24.214
Many people like to eat squid as snack.

615
00:23:24.215 --> 00:23:25.655
(People like to eat squid as snack.)

616
00:23:26.784 --> 00:23:29.244
- People love squids.
- Something to chew.

617
00:23:29.245 --> 00:23:31.614
People like to have something to chew.

618
00:23:32.255 --> 00:23:33.685
Thank you.

619
00:23:33.824 --> 00:23:37.094
Let each member get one at least. Please.

620
00:23:37.594 --> 00:23:39.854
I should take some action.

621
00:23:40.465 --> 00:23:42.093
From now on, you can take two bites.

622
00:23:42.094 --> 00:23:43.594
I'm so jealous.

623
00:23:44.465 --> 00:23:46.293
Can we take 1 bite?
- 1 bite?

624
00:23:46.294 --> 00:23:47.404
No, we can take two bites.

625
00:23:47.405 --> 00:23:49.804
- I'm going with jokbal.
- Try some chicken.

626
00:23:51.804 --> 00:23:53.134
Thank you for the food.

627
00:23:53.705 --> 00:23:55.445
It's nice to eat the food outdoors.

628
00:23:57.215 --> 00:23:58.944
Let me take a drumstick.

629
00:23:58.945 --> 00:24:00.884
- It looks tasty.
- He just had a bite.

630
00:24:03.715 --> 00:24:06.755
- Joon Ho, you had a bite.
- That was a bite.

631
00:24:07.324 --> 00:24:09.324
- You had a bite.
- You had a bite.

632
00:24:09.425 --> 00:24:11.494
You had a bite. You can't take it back.

633
00:24:11.495 --> 00:24:13.725
- You already had a bite.
- It went into his mouth.

634
00:24:13.864 --> 00:24:15.594
Let me go for my second bite then.

635
00:24:16.225 --> 00:24:18.935
It looks tasty. It looks so tasty.

636
00:24:21.205 --> 00:24:22.234
Hurry up.

637
00:24:22.235 --> 00:24:23.235
(To make up for his lost first bite, )

638
00:24:23.236 --> 00:24:24.504
(he squeezes the whole
piece into his mouth.)

639
00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:27.245
- It looks tasty.
- It looks dry.

640
00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:30.514
Can you eat seafood as a seafood yourself?

641
00:24:30.515 --> 00:24:33.583
- My gosh.
- Of course, Mr. Squid.

642
00:24:33.584 --> 00:24:36.015
- It's my turn.
- It has collagen in it.

643
00:24:36.245 --> 00:24:38.114
- Collagen.
- He's ready.

644
00:24:38.415 --> 00:24:39.415
Here it goes.

645
00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:41.484
(The eyeing guys don't matter to him...)

646
00:24:41.485 --> 00:24:42.883
(because it tastes so good.)

647
00:24:42.884 --> 00:24:44.553
How can I eat the chicken?

648
00:24:44.554 --> 00:24:45.654
(Joon Young wants to eat the chicken.)

649
00:24:45.655 --> 00:24:47.964
- Take one bite.
- Only one bite?

650
00:24:47.965 --> 00:24:49.724
We're not that strict.

651
00:24:49.725 --> 00:24:51.494
(He's generous to Joon Young only.)

652
00:24:51.495 --> 00:24:52.495
Take a drumstick.

653
00:24:53.765 --> 00:24:56.563
But you were so strict to him earlier.

654
00:24:56.564 --> 00:24:58.574
Joon Young, take a whole drumstick.

655
00:24:58.735 --> 00:25:00.204
He's only strict to Joon Ho...

656
00:25:00.205 --> 00:25:01.573
because he's a baby octopus.

657
00:25:01.574 --> 00:25:03.405
- I'll eat the chicken.
- A chicken wing.

658
00:25:04.015 --> 00:25:05.373
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

659
00:25:05.374 --> 00:25:06.984
It's my treat. Enjoy.

660
00:25:06.985 --> 00:25:07.985
Thank you for being ugly.

661
00:25:07.986 --> 00:25:09.484
You're welcome.

662
00:25:09.485 --> 00:25:11.613
I'm born to feed you guys.

663
00:25:11.614 --> 00:25:12.614
I want to eat some more.

664
00:25:12.615 --> 00:25:13.624
The next award is...

665
00:25:14.884 --> 00:25:16.224
Stupidest Member Award.

666
00:25:16.225 --> 00:25:17.554
(Stupidest Member Award)

667
00:25:18.024 --> 00:25:19.224
Let's all have a bite.

668
00:25:19.225 --> 00:25:20.764
Shall we all have a bite each?

669
00:25:20.765 --> 00:25:22.864
What's the most common comment you get?

670
00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:24.593
- Me?
- Stupid.

671
00:25:24.594 --> 00:25:25.665
(I'll keep it short.)

672
00:25:26.195 --> 00:25:27.304
Stupid.

673
00:25:28.604 --> 00:25:30.405
- Hurry up.
- It's a very easy one.

674
00:25:30.735 --> 00:25:32.404
It's so easy that even
children can answer it.

675
00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:34.103
My image has changed...

676
00:25:34.104 --> 00:25:35.873
a lot recently.

677
00:25:35.874 --> 00:25:37.313
- All right.
- It sure has.

678
00:25:37.314 --> 00:25:39.014
Why don't you just write your own name?

679
00:25:39.015 --> 00:25:40.745
Hurry up. Why take so long?

680
00:25:41.145 --> 00:25:42.215
It's difficult.

681
00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:44.215
Did you forget your own name?

682
00:25:45.155 --> 00:25:47.384
Hey. Dong Gu.

683
00:25:47.884 --> 00:25:49.255
I'm not that stupid.

684
00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:51.624
Why did you write "Kim"?

685
00:25:52.455 --> 00:25:54.215
Are you really going to
write your own name?

686
00:25:54.294 --> 00:25:55.864
- Yes.
- My goodness.

687
00:25:56.124 --> 00:25:57.934
You want to eat the food, don't you?

688
00:25:57.935 --> 00:25:59.863
- You want the food.
- I don't want to...

689
00:25:59.864 --> 00:26:01.080
- admit it, but...
- He wants the food.

690
00:26:01.104 --> 00:26:02.435
- Seriously?
- All right.

691
00:26:02.505 --> 00:26:03.603
- One...
- Is it unanimous?

692
00:26:03.604 --> 00:26:05.774
- 2, 3.
- This doesn't feel right.

693
00:26:06.374 --> 00:26:07.694
(They all wrote Jong Min's name.)

694
00:26:08.804 --> 00:26:10.774
It might be wrong. It's too obvious.

695
00:26:10.814 --> 00:26:13.584
Let me announce the ranking. Fifth place...

696
00:26:13.784 --> 00:26:14.784
goes to Joon Young.

697
00:26:14.785 --> 00:26:16.714
It's not that surprising.

698
00:26:16.715 --> 00:26:18.313
It means he doesn't know some things.

699
00:26:18.314 --> 00:26:20.383
- Fifth place? No problem.
- No problem.

700
00:26:20.384 --> 00:26:22.383
Actually, it looks cool
when he's like that.

701
00:26:22.384 --> 00:26:25.123
He doesn't know things, but his JQ is high.

702
00:26:25.124 --> 00:26:26.553
- JQ?
- What is JQ?

703
00:26:26.554 --> 00:26:27.964
It means he's proficient at cheap tricks.

704
00:26:27.965 --> 00:26:29.724
- I've never heard of it.
- What does J stand for?

705
00:26:29.725 --> 00:26:30.864
(What does J stand for?)

706
00:26:31.564 --> 00:26:32.734
(What a silly question.)

707
00:26:32.735 --> 00:26:34.404
My goodness.

708
00:26:34.405 --> 00:26:35.864
I'm sure everyone will get to eat.

709
00:26:36.205 --> 00:26:38.435
It's annoying such a guy
is better-looking than me.

710
00:26:39.205 --> 00:26:40.205
It must feel horrible.

711
00:26:40.505 --> 00:26:42.803
Fourth place goes to Soo Geun.

712
00:26:42.804 --> 00:26:44.014
Soo Geun.

713
00:26:44.015 --> 00:26:47.284
Soo Geun doesn't know much about proverbs.

714
00:26:47.614 --> 00:26:48.944
(The ear of the horse)

715
00:26:48.945 --> 00:26:49.945
(It hurts.)

716
00:26:51.584 --> 00:26:54.384
(At a quiz game held on one day in 2010)

717
00:26:55.955 --> 00:26:59.195
(Soo Geun was even more
ignorant than Jong Min.)

718
00:26:59.225 --> 00:27:02.023
You beat Jong Min.
- "It hurts"?

719
00:27:02.024 --> 00:27:03.424
Those who are ranked higher than third...

720
00:27:03.425 --> 00:27:04.564
are really stupid ones.

721
00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:05.671
This is where the real match begins.

722
00:27:05.695 --> 00:27:06.934
3rd place... - 3rd place is not bad.

723
00:27:06.935 --> 00:27:07.964
Goes to Joon Ho.

724
00:27:07.965 --> 00:27:10.205
(3rd place, Kim Joon Ho)

725
00:27:10.675 --> 00:27:11.833
I didn't see this coming.

726
00:27:11.834 --> 00:27:13.844
- Hang on a second.
- What a stupid.

727
00:27:13.905 --> 00:27:15.303
You know I was the quiz
champion several times.

728
00:27:15.304 --> 00:27:17.214
Stop pretending to be smart.

729
00:27:17.215 --> 00:27:19.313
- This is unexpected.
- The viewers chose you.

730
00:27:19.314 --> 00:27:21.844
I guess they picked me for no reason.

731
00:27:23.015 --> 00:27:24.455
(As one of the members of Season 1,)

732
00:27:25.384 --> 00:27:27.144
(he entertained us with
ridiculous answers.)

733
00:27:28.124 --> 00:27:31.695
(The nominee number 1, Eun Ji Won)

734
00:27:33.155 --> 00:27:34.293
It doesn't look nice.

735
00:27:34.294 --> 00:27:36.725
(His dumbness has 10 years of tradition.)

736
00:27:37.995 --> 00:27:39.894
Give it a try.

737
00:27:39.895 --> 00:27:41.563
- If possible...
- That's not what I meant.

738
00:27:41.564 --> 00:27:43.834
(He is dumb in so many different ways.)

739
00:27:44.905 --> 00:27:47.475
(The nominee number 2, Kim Jong Min)

740
00:27:48.874 --> 00:27:50.945
Stupidest Member Award goes to...

741
00:27:51.975 --> 00:27:53.014
Jong Min.

742
00:27:53.015 --> 00:27:54.714
(Jong Min wins Stupidest Member Award.)

743
00:27:54.715 --> 00:27:56.445
- Congratulations.
- Stupid Kim.

744
00:27:56.685 --> 00:27:58.383
- Stupid Kim.
- Congratulations.

745
00:27:58.384 --> 00:28:01.485
(Look at the stupidest man.)

746
00:28:01.685 --> 00:28:02.685
Thank you.

747
00:28:03.354 --> 00:28:05.655
(It's somehow touching.)

748
00:28:06.695 --> 00:28:09.363
The title is written in big red letters.

749
00:28:09.364 --> 00:28:11.044
(The title "Stupidest Member" stands out.)

750
00:28:11.495 --> 00:28:12.894
1, 2...

751
00:28:12.895 --> 00:28:13.964
(Congratulations)

752
00:28:13.965 --> 00:28:15.004
Thank you.

753
00:28:15.005 --> 00:28:16.005
(Congratulations)

754
00:28:16.205 --> 00:28:17.603
Now, it's time to take a bite.

755
00:28:17.604 --> 00:28:20.005
The quiz was too easy.

756
00:28:20.034 --> 00:28:21.674
- What should I eat?
- What should I eat?

757
00:28:21.675 --> 00:28:22.704
We all got the answer correctly.

758
00:28:22.705 --> 00:28:25.745
I feel like eomuk. No, I don't want it.

759
00:28:26.245 --> 00:28:27.985
Do you think I'm stupid?

760
00:28:28.114 --> 00:28:29.515
Give it to Jong Min.

761
00:28:30.215 --> 00:28:31.954
Jong Min, did you write your own name?

762
00:28:31.955 --> 00:28:32.955
Yes, I did.

763
00:28:33.755 --> 00:28:35.435
There was no other way. I wanted the food.

764
00:28:35.524 --> 00:28:37.330
- There was no other way.
- You did a good job.

765
00:28:37.354 --> 00:28:38.455
It looks amazing.

766
00:28:39.294 --> 00:28:40.925
- It tastes good.
- Take a big bite.

767
00:28:41.124 --> 00:28:42.925
Take one big bite.

768
00:28:43.195 --> 00:28:44.793
(Thanks to Jong Min, )

769
00:28:44.794 --> 00:28:46.034
(everyone took a bite each.)

770
00:28:47.405 --> 00:28:49.004
- Thank you, Jong Min.
- Thank you.

771
00:28:49.005 --> 00:28:52.204
Thank you for being dumb.

772
00:28:52.205 --> 00:28:53.404
Thank you for being stupid, Jong Min.

773
00:28:53.405 --> 00:28:54.474
It's a dinner party.

774
00:28:54.475 --> 00:28:55.995
(They had an unexpected dinner party.)

775
00:28:56.344 --> 00:28:57.344
It's my treat.

776
00:28:59.614 --> 00:29:03.584
The next award is for
the unluckiest member.

777
00:29:03.614 --> 00:29:06.554
It's Misfortune Award.

778
00:29:06.685 --> 00:29:08.924
Hang on a second. It's
going to be a close match.

779
00:29:08.925 --> 00:29:10.724
Jong Min is also quite unlucky.

780
00:29:10.725 --> 00:29:13.965
He already won an award,
so it might not be him.

781
00:29:14.364 --> 00:29:15.494
(But)

782
00:29:15.495 --> 00:29:17.794
(Is this what you call "misfortune"?)

783
00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:20.965
Congratulations on your second award.

784
00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:22.405
Let's have a beef party!

785
00:29:23.804 --> 00:29:25.474
Beef!

786
00:29:25.475 --> 00:29:28.404
- I love beef.
- Let's have a beef party.

787
00:29:28.405 --> 00:29:30.474
Wait a minute. Let me see.

788
00:29:30.475 --> 00:29:32.244
- I can't believe this.
- He said "Let me see".

789
00:29:32.245 --> 00:29:33.843
How could he talk like
that to the director?

790
00:29:33.844 --> 00:29:35.383
- He's so stupid.
- He's stupid.

791
00:29:35.384 --> 00:29:38.314
How stupid. How could you
talk like that to him?

792
00:29:38.884 --> 00:29:40.925
- What a dumb.
- Misfortune...

793
00:29:41.124 --> 00:29:42.284
never comes alone.

794
00:29:43.624 --> 00:29:45.824
(Congratulations on
winning the 2nd awards.)

795
00:29:46.995 --> 00:29:49.864
(They had to catch fish to avoid climbing.)

796
00:29:50.935 --> 00:29:53.504
(He failed and had to climb an ice wall.)

797
00:29:53.505 --> 00:29:55.385
(Make a firm meringue to
complete the mission.)

798
00:29:55.864 --> 00:29:58.475
(He started the mission before Tae Hyun...)

799
00:30:00.205 --> 00:30:01.205
(but failed.)

800
00:30:02.304 --> 00:30:03.873
(Jong Min was always unlucky...)

801
00:30:03.874 --> 00:30:06.015
(and it put him into trouble.)

802
00:30:06.745 --> 00:30:09.043
The next award is Best Friend Award.

803
00:30:09.044 --> 00:30:10.154
- Best Friend Award?
- Best Friend Award?

804
00:30:10.155 --> 00:30:12.813
It's for a male guest who
had the best chemistry...

805
00:30:12.814 --> 00:30:15.685
- with the members.
- A guest?

806
00:30:15.725 --> 00:30:17.255
One of the nominees is...

807
00:30:17.624 --> 00:30:18.695
Cha Soo Chan.

808
00:30:20.765 --> 00:30:22.024
- What?
- That sounds funny.

809
00:30:22.124 --> 00:30:24.895
- He is indeed a male.
- You surprised me.

810
00:30:25.395 --> 00:30:28.864
I went on a family trip to Mount Seorak.

811
00:30:28.965 --> 00:30:30.280
When we were on a cable car there,

812
00:30:30.304 --> 00:30:32.274
people recognized him but not me.

813
00:30:33.604 --> 00:30:35.603
He has a cute face.

814
00:30:35.604 --> 00:30:37.014
- It's easy to notice him.
- He's cute.

815
00:30:37.015 --> 00:30:38.445
He looks special.

816
00:30:38.475 --> 00:30:39.843
Because of Soo Chan, we
couldn't keep it secret.

817
00:30:39.844 --> 00:30:41.524
(He couldn't keep the family trip secret.)

818
00:30:42.015 --> 00:30:43.144
- My goodness.
- Did he win fifth place?

819
00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:44.984
Cantos was also nominated.

820
00:30:44.985 --> 00:30:46.113
- The dog?
- Cantos.

821
00:30:46.114 --> 00:30:48.254
- It's a male dog.
- He detects cigarettes.

822
00:30:48.255 --> 00:30:49.655
He was really scary.

823
00:30:50.155 --> 00:30:53.665
(Cantos joined them on "No Smoking Trip".)

824
00:30:54.594 --> 00:30:55.664
Do you have any cigarettes?

825
00:30:55.665 --> 00:30:56.695
No.

826
00:30:56.995 --> 00:31:00.465
(He was very good at finding cigarettes.)

827
00:31:01.104 --> 00:31:02.104
I don't have it.

828
00:31:02.465 --> 00:31:03.505
One Night...

829
00:31:04.774 --> 00:31:06.073
Two Days.

830
00:31:06.074 --> 00:31:07.144
Gosh, you're good.

831
00:31:07.145 --> 00:31:08.985
(The art student was
pretty good at anything.)

832
00:31:09.344 --> 00:31:10.374
(5th place, Lee Seo Jin)

833
00:31:11.614 --> 00:31:15.844
(Unlike his appearance, he was very naive.)

834
00:31:16.485 --> 00:31:17.553
What should I do?

835
00:31:17.554 --> 00:31:19.755
(One Night Two Days)

836
00:31:20.554 --> 00:31:25.155
(Mr. Ugly who enjoyed the
wild without hesitation)

837
00:31:26.925 --> 00:31:31.834
(4th in Best Friend Award, Park Seo Jun)

838
00:31:32.134 --> 00:31:34.633
Since I met Seo Jun in that episode,

839
00:31:34.634 --> 00:31:37.373
we've become very close.

840
00:31:37.374 --> 00:31:38.603
- Right.
- He's a close friend.

841
00:31:38.604 --> 00:31:41.404
- We're close.
- It's good to see him.

842
00:31:41.405 --> 00:31:43.174
Seo Jun's been successful since then.

843
00:31:43.175 --> 00:31:45.544
- I know.
- Things are going well.

844
00:31:45.844 --> 00:31:48.214
(He's on a roll.)

845
00:31:48.215 --> 00:31:50.454
- Then...
- We have one person left.

846
00:31:50.455 --> 00:31:53.455
I'm sure I'll get to eat this time.

847
00:31:53.955 --> 00:31:54.984
I saw this.

848
00:31:54.985 --> 00:31:56.995
It's got the highest ratings, right?

849
00:31:57.094 --> 00:31:58.225
It wasn't us though.

850
00:31:58.395 --> 00:32:00.224
I get it.

851
00:32:00.225 --> 00:32:01.293
- You do?
- Yes!

852
00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:02.623
We'll definitely eat this time.

853
00:32:02.624 --> 00:32:05.194
- Is that him?
- I have no idea.

854
00:32:05.195 --> 00:32:07.164
I'm 100 percent sure.

855
00:32:07.165 --> 00:32:10.063
You should write Ji Tae's name.
He's your friend.

856
00:32:10.064 --> 00:32:12.734
I'd give up a bite and write his name.

857
00:32:12.735 --> 00:32:14.445
Don't write, "I love you, Ji Tae."

858
00:32:14.774 --> 00:32:17.373
- How did you know?
- Don't do that.

859
00:32:17.374 --> 00:32:18.573
I'm not doing it.

860
00:32:18.574 --> 00:32:20.944
I told you not to do such a thing.

861
00:32:20.945 --> 00:32:22.843
You're being ridiculous.

862
00:32:22.844 --> 00:32:24.784
Show me your answers. In 1, 2, and 3.

863
00:32:24.985 --> 00:32:27.054
- It's him.
- I wrote Park Chan Ho.

864
00:32:27.084 --> 00:32:30.495
The episode got like 40
percent of viewer ratings.

865
00:32:31.054 --> 00:32:33.764
It was amazing. Jong Min,
you didn't write his name.

866
00:32:33.765 --> 00:32:35.563
Zo In Sung was the best guest in Season 3.

867
00:32:35.564 --> 00:32:37.664
It recorded the highest ratings.

868
00:32:37.665 --> 00:32:40.133
I gave up to give the correct answer.

869
00:32:40.134 --> 00:32:41.735
I chose friendship over a bite.

870
00:32:42.235 --> 00:32:44.704
What does it say on the next page?

871
00:32:44.705 --> 00:32:46.904
On the next page, it says Park Chan Ho.

872
00:32:46.905 --> 00:32:48.374
And it says, "I'm sorry, Ji Tae."

873
00:32:49.844 --> 00:32:52.675
- It's Ji Tae!
- Zo In Sung is third.

874
00:32:53.274 --> 00:32:54.384
I see.

875
00:32:54.685 --> 00:32:57.184
It's hard to see In Sung on variety shows.

876
00:32:57.185 --> 00:32:58.314
I see him very often.

877
00:32:59.985 --> 00:33:01.255
I'm tired of him.

878
00:33:03.895 --> 00:33:06.353
(He was tricked into joining...)

879
00:33:06.354 --> 00:33:09.094
(One Night Two Days by Tae Hyun.)

880
00:33:10.265 --> 00:33:13.034
- Drunk guys?
- Anyway.

881
00:33:13.604 --> 00:33:17.134
(In Sung was forgiven
no matter what he did.)

882
00:33:17.935 --> 00:33:19.005
(This is too tight.)

883
00:33:19.774 --> 00:33:23.874
(He gave off his charm
as much as he liked.)

884
00:33:24.445 --> 00:33:27.014
The winner of Best Friend Award is...

885
00:33:27.015 --> 00:33:28.495
(Is it the man we're thinking about?)

886
00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:29.745
Park...

887
00:33:29.945 --> 00:33:30.955
Park...

888
00:33:31.584 --> 00:33:33.154
- Bo Gum.
- It's Bo Gum.

889
00:33:33.155 --> 00:33:34.754
- That's right.
- Gosh, it's Bo Gum.

890
00:33:34.755 --> 00:33:37.123
I didn't think of Bo Gum.

891
00:33:37.124 --> 00:33:38.954
I'm so sorry.

892
00:33:38.955 --> 00:33:41.323
- It was Bo Gum.
- Bo Gum.

893
00:33:41.324 --> 00:33:44.534
Bo Gum even made Jong Min go on the rides.

894
00:33:44.895 --> 00:33:47.405
He completely fell for Bo Gum.

895
00:33:48.304 --> 00:33:51.803
(Jong Min had acrophobia.)

896
00:33:51.804 --> 00:33:53.475
I can't do it.

897
00:33:53.874 --> 00:33:56.303
(And Bo Gum came to Jong Min.)

898
00:33:56.304 --> 00:33:57.313
It's four of us.

899
00:33:57.314 --> 00:34:01.843
(With his warm words, he
melted Jong Min's heart.)

900
00:34:01.844 --> 00:34:03.954
We won't get to try it together ever again.

901
00:34:03.955 --> 00:34:05.213
Why are you doing this to me?

902
00:34:05.214 --> 00:34:06.374
Why are you doing this to me?

903
00:34:06.614 --> 00:34:08.355
Gosh, Bo Gum, you brat.

904
00:34:08.754 --> 00:34:14.765
(It was like Bo Gum's magic.)

905
00:34:16.094 --> 00:34:22.705
(He brought about a change
in Jong Min's life.)

906
00:34:24.134 --> 00:34:25.205
This is amazing.

907
00:34:29.674 --> 00:34:31.974
Why didn't we think of Bo Gum?

908
00:34:31.975 --> 00:34:32.975
(We're sorry, Bo Gum.)

909
00:34:33.214 --> 00:34:36.685
The episode with Chan Ho was just as great.

910
00:34:37.685 --> 00:34:42.685
(Chan Ho even went into
ice water in winter.)

911
00:34:43.625 --> 00:34:47.564
(We could see the new side of him.)

912
00:34:47.565 --> 00:34:49.264
If you search our show on the internet,

913
00:34:49.265 --> 00:34:50.764
his name pops right out together.

914
00:34:50.765 --> 00:34:53.503
- It was that good.
- Right. Mount Baekdu.

915
00:34:53.504 --> 00:34:55.363
- It was impressive.
- Bo Gum's there too.

916
00:34:55.364 --> 00:34:58.134
- The last question.
- Let's up the ante.

917
00:34:58.234 --> 00:34:59.934
A chance for a bowl.

918
00:34:59.935 --> 00:35:01.374
A chance for a bowl? Let's do that.

919
00:35:01.375 --> 00:35:02.875
- All right.
- Good.

920
00:35:03.645 --> 00:35:06.044
The last question is...

921
00:35:06.045 --> 00:35:07.745
- Female guest.
- Best Female Guest Award.

922
00:35:08.415 --> 00:35:10.553
Gosh, this is so hard.

923
00:35:10.554 --> 00:35:12.954
Best Female Guest Award?
There was Kim Ha Neul...

924
00:35:12.955 --> 00:35:14.253
in Actress Special.

925
00:35:14.254 --> 00:35:17.394
We can't just pick one
person in Actress Special.

926
00:35:17.395 --> 00:35:22.064
We've had a lot of amazing female guests.

927
00:35:22.065 --> 00:35:23.994
But we have to pick one.

928
00:35:23.995 --> 00:35:26.363
- I have one in my mind.
- Give me a hint.

929
00:35:26.364 --> 00:35:28.705
- Give us a hint.
- I'll tell you fifth.

930
00:35:28.804 --> 00:35:29.835
Fifth is...

931
00:35:30.705 --> 00:35:31.835
Shin Ji.

932
00:35:32.034 --> 00:35:34.174
- Shin Ji.
- I see. It's Shin Ji.

933
00:35:34.444 --> 00:35:36.174
Shin Ji was amazing.

934
00:35:37.015 --> 00:35:43.245
(Over the last 10 years,
she's been with Jong Min.)

935
00:35:43.415 --> 00:35:46.184
(She's Jong Min's best friend...)

936
00:35:46.185 --> 00:35:50.955
(who's appeared in the show the most.)

937
00:35:52.455 --> 00:35:54.463
There was Girlfriend Special.

938
00:35:54.464 --> 00:35:55.664
- Moon Geun Young.
- There was Geun Young.

939
00:35:55.665 --> 00:35:56.693
- And Park Bo Young.
- Bo Young.

940
00:35:56.694 --> 00:35:58.764
- There are a lot.
- Geun Young.

941
00:35:58.765 --> 00:36:00.564
Fourth is Kim Ha Neul.

942
00:36:00.565 --> 00:36:01.803
- Ha Neul.
- I see.

943
00:36:01.804 --> 00:36:04.274
- Was Ha Neul in Season 2?
- No, in Season 1.

944
00:36:04.275 --> 00:36:07.245
(Ha Neul was in Actress
Special of Season 1.)

945
00:36:08.004 --> 00:36:12.843
(Giving off her innocent charm, )

946
00:36:12.844 --> 00:36:18.355
(she showed the new side of her.)

947
00:36:19.185 --> 00:36:20.224
Thank you.

948
00:36:20.225 --> 00:36:24.225
(Ha Neul was beautiful
even with no makeup on.)

949
00:36:24.955 --> 00:36:26.625
- That's amazing.
- Write your answer.

950
00:36:27.395 --> 00:36:28.765
(Impressed)

951
00:36:29.694 --> 00:36:30.995
(It's time to give an answer.)

952
00:36:31.435 --> 00:36:33.394
- What?
- I told you fourth place.

953
00:36:33.395 --> 00:36:35.264
- What about the third?
- No.

954
00:36:35.265 --> 00:36:36.534
This is so easy.

955
00:36:36.605 --> 00:36:38.573
- It's so obvious.
- I think...

956
00:36:38.574 --> 00:36:39.904
Why are we hesitating?

957
00:36:40.545 --> 00:36:42.274
We already mentioned her name a lot.

958
00:36:42.275 --> 00:36:44.843
We've talked about her for a year.

959
00:36:44.844 --> 00:36:46.984
I guess we should take it easy.

960
00:36:47.784 --> 00:36:50.355
I still remember I won the
popularity vote then.

961
00:36:51.384 --> 00:36:52.884
Who? I was the second.

962
00:36:53.725 --> 00:36:55.185
I don't know. You just liked me.

963
00:36:55.654 --> 00:36:56.684
(Embarrassed)

964
00:36:56.685 --> 00:36:58.553
- Did I say that?
- You did.

965
00:36:58.554 --> 00:37:00.363
You've misunderstood me since then.

966
00:37:00.364 --> 00:37:01.963
It's not a misunderstanding.

967
00:37:01.964 --> 00:37:03.963
- It's the truth.
- Exactly.

968
00:37:03.964 --> 00:37:05.894
- It's okay to like me.
- All right.

969
00:37:05.895 --> 00:37:07.533
- Are you done?
- Yes.

970
00:37:07.534 --> 00:37:09.504
Show me your answers. In 1, 2, and 3.

971
00:37:09.765 --> 00:37:12.173
She's always in our hearts.

972
00:37:12.174 --> 00:37:13.673
- You don't have her name?
- Me?

973
00:37:13.674 --> 00:37:16.144
Everyone says Han Hyo Joo.

974
00:37:16.145 --> 00:37:17.874
I'm the only one who has
a different answer.

975
00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:19.843
(Tae Hyun chose Bo Young.)

976
00:37:19.844 --> 00:37:21.744
- Look at you.
- Bo Young?

977
00:37:21.745 --> 00:37:23.530
Bo Young joined our show
even when she was sick.

978
00:37:23.554 --> 00:37:24.585
Who did you write?

979
00:37:25.455 --> 00:37:26.924
I'm feel apologetic to Bo Gum.

980
00:37:28.185 --> 00:37:30.954
- Don't be sorry.
- We said her name a lot.

981
00:37:30.955 --> 00:37:33.863
- It must be Hyo Joo.
- I know.

982
00:37:33.864 --> 00:37:35.193
She's in our hearts.

983
00:37:35.194 --> 00:37:38.693
But our viewers might think differently.

984
00:37:38.694 --> 00:37:39.733
We had a lot of fun with You Jung though.

985
00:37:39.734 --> 00:37:40.804
Right, You Jung!

986
00:37:41.265 --> 00:37:44.033
(You Jung!)

987
00:37:44.034 --> 00:37:45.774
It was a lot of fun when You Jung was here.

988
00:37:45.775 --> 00:37:47.974
- She was so good.
- I didn't think of that.

989
00:37:47.975 --> 00:37:49.003
Can I change my answer?

990
00:37:49.004 --> 00:37:51.114
- She might be the winner.
- It must be You Jung.

991
00:37:51.844 --> 00:37:54.884
(Kim You Jung joined
School Trip with Friends.)

992
00:37:56.815 --> 00:37:58.614
(Making a fuss)

993
00:38:00.085 --> 00:38:06.525
(She spent some quality
time with Jong Min.)

994
00:38:07.424 --> 00:38:09.394
Please let me change my answer.

995
00:38:09.395 --> 00:38:11.194
- You can do that.
- Change it.

996
00:38:12.034 --> 00:38:15.033
Change it. You didn't like
Hyo Joo to begin with.

997
00:38:15.034 --> 00:38:17.105
- You like Joon Young.
- She's just an obstacle.

998
00:38:17.634 --> 00:38:19.573
You only like Joon Young.

999
00:38:19.574 --> 00:38:21.374
He's so cool. He's a man
with his own beliefs.

1000
00:38:21.375 --> 00:38:24.744
He's never liked Hyo Joo the whole time.

1001
00:38:24.745 --> 00:38:25.815
You're right.

1002
00:38:26.315 --> 00:38:27.715
Let's do this with our own beliefs.

1003
00:38:28.284 --> 00:38:29.745
- You Jung!
- You changed it.

1004
00:38:30.214 --> 00:38:31.284
It's You Jung.

1005
00:38:31.355 --> 00:38:33.354
- You Jung.
- Let's do this.

1006
00:38:33.355 --> 00:38:35.153
I'll give you a chance
to change your answer.

1007
00:38:35.154 --> 00:38:37.125
- No, I won't change it.
- I won't be fooled.

1008
00:38:37.525 --> 00:38:39.824
All right. I'll announce the winner.
Third is...

1009
00:38:40.725 --> 00:38:41.765
Park Bo Young.

1010
00:38:42.324 --> 00:38:43.363
Bo Young is third.

1011
00:38:43.364 --> 00:38:44.364
(Disappointed)

1012
00:38:44.365 --> 00:38:46.864
- It's Bo Young.
- She's good though.

1013
00:38:47.464 --> 00:38:49.504
(Lovely Bo Young was in
Girlfriend Special.)

1014
00:38:51.935 --> 00:38:56.815
(She was a cute and lucky girl.)

1015
00:38:57.245 --> 00:38:58.444
Is there anyone here?

1016
00:38:59.815 --> 00:39:01.215
There are no reporters around here.

1017
00:39:01.745 --> 00:39:02.984
That's too bad.

1018
00:39:03.085 --> 00:39:07.823
(She's good at singing and dancing.)

1019
00:39:07.824 --> 00:39:12.895
(She's a talented actress
with a high-pitched tone.)

1020
00:39:13.395 --> 00:39:15.665
I'll tell you the top two nominees.

1021
00:39:16.395 --> 00:39:20.503
Han Hyo Joo who appeared in Season 3.

1022
00:39:20.504 --> 00:39:22.903
- I knew it.
- It's Hyo Joo.

1023
00:39:22.904 --> 00:39:25.003
And from Season 1...

1024
00:39:25.004 --> 00:39:26.503
- Is it Kim Su Mi?
- Choi Ji Woo?

1025
00:39:26.504 --> 00:39:28.105
- Choi Ji Woo.
- I see.

1026
00:39:28.844 --> 00:39:30.003
(I'm doomed.)

1027
00:39:30.004 --> 00:39:31.714
I knew it.

1028
00:39:31.944 --> 00:39:33.384
Why did you let me change my answer?

1029
00:39:34.245 --> 00:39:36.483
Why did you give me a chance to change it?

1030
00:39:36.484 --> 00:39:37.783
- He's never done that.
- Sit down.

1031
00:39:37.784 --> 00:39:39.454
That's not what he does.

1032
00:39:39.455 --> 00:39:40.855
You have no luck.

1033
00:39:41.455 --> 00:39:42.955
He's no luck at all.

1034
00:39:43.254 --> 00:39:44.854
No wonder I won the Misfortune Award.

1035
00:39:44.855 --> 00:39:46.535
(Jong Min is happy because of Joon Young.)

1036
00:39:46.594 --> 00:39:48.394
- He's unfortunate.
- This is so nice.

1037
00:39:48.395 --> 00:39:50.025
(It's the symbol of misfortune.)

1038
00:39:51.134 --> 00:39:53.233
- Let's continue.
- Announcing the winner.

1039
00:39:53.234 --> 00:39:55.434
The winner of Best Female Guest Award is...

1040
00:39:55.435 --> 00:39:56.874
- We kept saying her name.
- Right.

1041
00:39:56.875 --> 00:39:57.903
Ms. Han!

1042
00:39:57.904 --> 00:40:01.344
(Is the winner Hyo Joo?)

1043
00:40:02.444 --> 00:40:04.274
- Han Hyo Joo.
- Yes!

1044
00:40:04.275 --> 00:40:05.545
(The winner is Han Hyo Joo.)

1045
00:40:05.775 --> 00:40:08.384
(Disappointed)

1046
00:40:08.614 --> 00:40:11.685
- I knew it.
- Are you a fool?

1047
00:40:12.214 --> 00:40:18.895
(Ji Woo was so lovely in Actress Special.)

1048
00:40:19.654 --> 00:40:21.694
One Night Two Days!

1049
00:40:22.324 --> 00:40:24.694
(She jumped into the water by the book.)

1050
00:40:25.234 --> 00:40:29.034
(There's a touch of humanity about her.)

1051
00:40:31.835 --> 00:40:38.914
(She adapted herself to
the show being polite, )

1052
00:40:38.915 --> 00:40:42.983
(which surprised all the members.)

1053
00:40:42.984 --> 00:40:48.884
(Han Hyo Joo is the best
female guest ever.)

1054
00:40:50.254 --> 00:40:54.024
Hyo Joo, join our show
again if you watch this.

1055
00:40:54.025 --> 00:40:56.794
- We miss you.
- No more starch syrup.

1056
00:40:56.795 --> 00:40:59.264
- We really mean it.
- I won't add it again.

1057
00:40:59.265 --> 00:41:02.264
We'll give you a ride in a cultivator.

1058
00:41:02.265 --> 00:41:03.903
I'll give you a ride in
a tractor this time.

1059
00:41:03.904 --> 00:41:05.604
You mean this?

1060
00:41:05.605 --> 00:41:06.605
(Please come back again.)

1061
00:41:06.606 --> 00:41:08.044
The 4 of you get 1 bowl chance.

1062
00:41:08.045 --> 00:41:10.214
- One bowl chance!
- Nice.

1063
00:41:10.614 --> 00:41:11.854
- I'm starving.
- That's great.

1064
00:41:12.214 --> 00:41:13.315
This is delicious.

1065
00:41:14.245 --> 00:41:15.284
Pick this up and eat.

1066
00:41:15.315 --> 00:41:17.484
Is this an empty bowl? I'm so full.

1067
00:41:18.614 --> 00:41:20.225
Thank you for the meal. Thanks, Hyo Joo.

1068
00:41:20.554 --> 00:41:21.725
- It's good.
- Thank you.

1069
00:41:23.384 --> 00:41:25.424
Why wasn't You Jung there?

1070
00:41:25.955 --> 00:41:26.995
(Upset)

1071
00:41:27.765 --> 00:41:29.995
All right. The award ceremony is over.

1072
00:41:30.234 --> 00:41:32.395
Jong Min received two awards.

1073
00:41:33.395 --> 00:41:36.304
We want to give everyone else a trophy too.

1074
00:41:36.734 --> 00:41:39.234
So we'll hold Our Own Awards.

1075
00:41:39.875 --> 00:41:40.904
Please bring them out.

1076
00:41:41.404 --> 00:41:42.444
Does it say something?

1077
00:41:43.004 --> 00:41:44.375
Jong Min has three.

1078
00:41:45.074 --> 00:41:48.213
- Three trophies.
- You want us to pick.

1079
00:41:48.214 --> 00:41:49.384
You want us to choose.

1080
00:41:49.415 --> 00:41:52.315
The trophies each have
a member's name on it.

1081
00:41:52.554 --> 00:41:54.284
Let's be positive.

1082
00:41:54.324 --> 00:41:56.054
Let's go with something nice.

1083
00:41:56.185 --> 00:41:58.324
- Let's be nice this time.
- Yes.

1084
00:41:58.424 --> 00:42:00.364
Will Joon Ho go first?

1085
00:42:01.395 --> 00:42:04.964
I want to receive Best Dressed Award.

1086
00:42:05.795 --> 00:42:10.134
(We'll make your wish come true.)

1087
00:42:11.105 --> 00:42:14.503
I want to receive Best Dressed Award.

1088
00:42:14.504 --> 00:42:15.705
Dirtiest Dresser Award.

1089
00:42:17.344 --> 00:42:19.444
(They changed the award in a second.)

1090
00:42:19.614 --> 00:42:20.843
- The dirtiest dresser.
- Wait.

1091
00:42:20.844 --> 00:42:22.544
Let's go with something positive.

1092
00:42:22.545 --> 00:42:23.684
Let's be positive.

1093
00:42:23.685 --> 00:42:25.614
(Laughing)

1094
00:42:26.214 --> 00:42:27.753
How about Smelly Award?

1095
00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:28.855
Odor Award?

1096
00:42:30.324 --> 00:42:31.594
How about Yellow Teeth Award?

1097
00:42:32.025 --> 00:42:33.765
Like the Golden Lion Award.

1098
00:42:34.225 --> 00:42:36.024
- Golden Teeth Award.
- Golden Teeth Award?

1099
00:42:36.025 --> 00:42:37.093
Yellow teeth.

1100
00:42:37.094 --> 00:42:39.795
Then give us a yellow marker.

1101
00:42:40.304 --> 00:42:42.864
Because we need to draw teeth here.

1102
00:42:44.134 --> 00:42:45.275
I didn't start this.

1103
00:42:45.835 --> 00:42:48.244
- Yellow Teeth Award.
- Odor Award.

1104
00:42:48.245 --> 00:42:50.074
- Odor Award.
- Fart Award?

1105
00:42:50.475 --> 00:42:52.314
Let's go with Red Skin Award.

1106
00:42:52.315 --> 00:42:54.415
- Red Skin.
- Red skin disease.

1107
00:42:54.844 --> 00:42:56.185
Red skin diseases is funny.

1108
00:42:57.214 --> 00:43:00.154
This is the same as that game.

1109
00:43:00.254 --> 00:43:03.754
- Without the trophy...
- It's "Your Flaws".

1110
00:43:04.054 --> 00:43:05.423
I'm fine. I'm neat these days.

1111
00:43:05.424 --> 00:43:07.363
"I'm neat these days."
- Let me see.

1112
00:43:07.364 --> 00:43:10.165
I'm getting whitening treatments.

1113
00:43:10.835 --> 00:43:14.364
Golden Teeth Award is just so perfect.

1114
00:43:15.634 --> 00:43:17.004
I think that's the best.

1115
00:43:17.105 --> 00:43:18.874
- That's it?
- Please write that down.

1116
00:43:18.875 --> 00:43:21.344
Actually I was angry before.

1117
00:43:22.074 --> 00:43:23.573
Because I didn't think they were yellow.

1118
00:43:23.574 --> 00:43:25.713
But after looking at
myself in the mirror...

1119
00:43:25.714 --> 00:43:26.783
(I realized they were yellow.)

1120
00:43:26.784 --> 00:43:27.984
This one tooth here.

1121
00:43:28.614 --> 00:43:29.684
He knows.

1122
00:43:29.685 --> 00:43:31.713
(Tae Hyun carefully completes the trophy.)

1123
00:43:31.714 --> 00:43:33.284
Thank you for Golden Teeth Award.

1124
00:43:33.955 --> 00:43:36.625
This would be the first of the kind...

1125
00:43:37.054 --> 00:43:38.594
- Nice.
- It's pure gold.

1126
00:43:39.094 --> 00:43:40.495
- I drew teeth on here.
- Okay.

1127
00:43:41.495 --> 00:43:46.234
(They present the first award as they hum.)

1128
00:43:49.705 --> 00:43:51.604
- Golden Teeth Award.
- Congratulations.

Kim Jong Min. - 100th Day Party Award.

1290
00:49:50.065 --> 00:49:51.435
Mine was very quick.

1291
00:49:52.864 --> 00:49:56.504
(100th Day Party Award, Kim Jong Min)

1292
00:49:56.975 --> 00:49:59.275
We walked out of the water after the dive.

1293
00:49:59.674 --> 00:50:01.545
We were all getting changed.

1294
00:50:01.645 --> 00:50:02.774
- I was shocked.
- Why?

1295
00:50:02.775 --> 00:50:05.375
Jong Min, like a baby at
his 100th-day party...

1296
00:50:05.515 --> 00:50:07.814
100th Day Party.
- 100th Day Party.

1297
00:50:07.815 --> 00:50:11.085
(A 100-day-old baby with leg hair)

1298
00:50:11.955 --> 00:50:12.984
He's a good baby.

1299
00:50:13.415 --> 00:50:15.054
He got so many awards.

1300
00:50:15.955 --> 00:50:18.394
Now let's do the main event.

1301
00:50:18.395 --> 00:50:19.725
What do you mean by main event?

1302
00:50:20.625 --> 00:50:22.823
Something about squid?

1303
00:50:22.824 --> 00:50:24.094
I Want to Kiss Award.

1304
00:50:27.234 --> 00:50:29.205
(This is why he's the main event.)

1305
00:50:30.435 --> 00:50:31.774
This is the final award!

1306
00:50:31.775 --> 00:50:32.775
(Hooray!)

1307
00:50:32.776 --> 00:50:34.504
- It's the main event!
- Nice.

1308
00:50:35.174 --> 00:50:37.275
I wrote that down. I Want to Kiss Award.

1309
00:50:37.375 --> 00:50:40.044
- I Want to Kiss Award.
- Will you write more?

1310
00:50:40.045 --> 00:50:41.544
Of course.

1311
00:50:41.545 --> 00:50:42.613
There's a lot of space.

1312
00:50:42.614 --> 00:50:46.153
He'll receive the most awards in history.

1313
00:50:46.154 --> 00:50:48.854
- I Want To Kiss Award.
- I Want To Kiss Award.

1314
00:50:48.855 --> 00:50:51.394
- Never Been Kissed...
- Never Been Kissed?

1315
00:50:51.395 --> 00:50:52.454
Never Been Kissed Award.

1316
00:50:52.455 --> 00:50:54.124
- Write that one down.
- Chastity Award.

1317
00:50:54.125 --> 00:50:57.334
- Because he's chaste.
- Chastity Award is neat.

1318
00:50:57.335 --> 00:50:58.794
- Chastity Award.
- He's chaste.

1319
00:50:58.795 --> 00:51:01.034
Imaginary Boyfriend Award.

1320
00:51:02.464 --> 00:51:04.774
Imaginary Boyfriend Award?

1321
00:51:04.775 --> 00:51:07.045
- That rhymes.
- I know.

1322
00:51:07.245 --> 00:51:08.403
That's not a trophy.

1323
00:51:08.404 --> 00:51:09.404
(That's not an award.)

1324
00:51:09.405 --> 00:51:10.545
That's not a trophy.

1325
00:51:11.214 --> 00:51:12.514
My goodness.

1326
00:51:12.515 --> 00:51:14.713
- It cost us a lot of money.
- Really?

1327
00:51:14.714 --> 00:51:17.384
It cost them a lot of money.

1328
00:51:17.415 --> 00:51:19.855
What were you thinking? My goodness.

1329
00:51:21.154 --> 00:51:23.153
I will fill up the last blank myself later.

1330
00:51:23.154 --> 00:51:24.254
(Let's stop now.)

1331
00:51:24.295 --> 00:51:27.494
You can write your first
girlfriend's name on it.

1332
00:51:27.495 --> 00:51:28.735
People will think this is real.

1333
00:51:29.995 --> 00:51:33.193
- Let's set up Defconn...
- Your first girlfriend.

1334
00:51:33.194 --> 00:51:34.963
On a blind date, not Jong Min.

1335
00:51:34.964 --> 00:51:36.404
- That's right.
- Here we go.

1336
00:51:36.904 --> 00:51:38.903
- Please take my picture.
- Gosh, this is annoying.

1337
00:51:38.904 --> 00:51:40.244
(Imaginary Boyfriend Award)

1338
00:51:40.245 --> 00:51:41.874
- Let's do it.
- Take three pictures.

1339
00:51:41.875 --> 00:51:43.713
- He won three awards.
- Thank you.

1340
00:51:43.714 --> 00:51:44.714
Way to go.

1341
00:51:44.715 --> 00:51:48.244
Defconn will stay as a single.

1342
00:51:48.245 --> 00:51:50.984
(He won't kiss anyone for the show.)

1343
00:51:51.614 --> 00:51:52.814
His character as a single is funny.

1344
00:51:52.815 --> 00:51:57.394
(He will stay as a single for the show.)

1345
00:51:57.395 --> 00:51:59.754
He's amazing. He'd do it for the viewers.

1346
00:52:00.265 --> 00:52:02.265
(He even has an imaginary girlfriend.)

1347
00:52:03.495 --> 00:52:06.765
(We present these awards
to our chaste Defconn.)

1348
00:52:08.265 --> 00:52:10.104
(I Want to Kiss Award, Chastity Award, )

1349
00:52:10.105 --> 00:52:11.904
(Imaginary Boyfriend Award)

1350
00:52:12.174 --> 00:52:16.375
Anyway, you've won at least one award each.

1351
00:52:16.504 --> 00:52:17.515
And...

1352
00:52:17.545 --> 00:52:18.915
(And?)

1353
00:52:19.145 --> 00:52:22.613
Among the winners, you will deliver...

1354
00:52:22.614 --> 00:52:25.315
- the trophy...
- Ourselves?

1355
00:52:25.714 --> 00:52:27.625
To only one of them.

1356
00:52:27.824 --> 00:52:29.053
- Gosh.
- Now?

1357
00:52:29.054 --> 00:52:31.294
- Now? Oh, later.
- Later.

1358
00:52:31.295 --> 00:52:32.624
Who are the winners? Bo Gum.

1359
00:52:32.625 --> 00:52:34.294
Hyo Joo. We should deliver it.

1360
00:52:34.295 --> 00:52:37.435
- We should.
- I can make time for it.

1361
00:52:37.694 --> 00:52:40.165
- I'll go.
- I'm the hardworking one.

1362
00:52:40.265 --> 00:52:41.765
I'll deliver it.

1363
00:52:42.065 --> 00:52:43.404
I'm chaste, so I'll go.

1364
00:52:43.634 --> 00:52:45.174
(Self-destruct)

1365
00:52:45.875 --> 00:52:48.475
Please pick 1 winner. Just 1.

1366
00:52:48.545 --> 00:52:51.714
- Ji Won, Hyo Joo, Bo Gum.
- Bo Gum.

1367
00:52:52.114 --> 00:52:54.614
- We should go to Bo Gum.
- It should be Hyo Joo.

1368
00:52:54.815 --> 00:52:56.444
You should deliver it to Ji Won.

1369
00:52:56.614 --> 00:53:00.054
- Ji Won?
- He misses our show,

1370
00:53:00.085 --> 00:53:01.185
so let's go to Ji Won.

1371
00:53:02.625 --> 00:53:05.193
(Do you remember?)

1372
00:53:05.194 --> 00:53:06.395
Has it been two years?

1373
00:53:08.765 --> 00:53:10.864
(He came to wake us up.)

1374
00:53:15.804 --> 00:53:18.504
(He still did crazy things, )

1375
00:53:22.444 --> 00:53:26.784
(but he did make us wide awake.)

1376
00:53:27.015 --> 00:53:28.585
Ji Won.

1377
00:53:30.315 --> 00:53:32.614
Okay, you can go then.

1378
00:53:33.654 --> 00:53:35.153
That's good.

1379
00:53:35.154 --> 00:53:36.654
All right, go ahead.

1380
00:53:37.094 --> 00:53:39.193
(Seriously No Fun Award, Yoon Dong Gu)

1381
00:53:39.194 --> 00:53:41.094
The winner of Seriously No Fun Award...

1382
00:53:41.525 --> 00:53:42.794
Why?

1383
00:53:42.795 --> 00:53:45.034
And Hardworking Award.

1384
00:53:45.165 --> 00:53:47.764
- Why do I have to go?
- Way to go, Dong Gu.

1385
00:53:47.765 --> 00:53:48.804
(It's typical.)

1386
00:53:49.065 --> 00:53:50.274
Keep working hard.

1387
00:53:50.275 --> 00:53:54.003
He really deserves those awards.

1388
00:53:54.004 --> 00:53:55.803
You're so hardworking.

1389
00:53:55.804 --> 00:53:56.814
It's settled.

1390
00:53:56.815 --> 00:53:58.673
- I'll go to Hyo Joo.
- Let's decide it.

1391
00:53:58.674 --> 00:54:01.014
Please pick one person...

1392
00:54:01.015 --> 00:54:03.484
you really want to deliver the trophy to.

1393
00:54:03.614 --> 00:54:05.114
1, 2, 3.

1394
00:54:05.154 --> 00:54:06.314
- Han Hyo Joo.
- Han Hyo Joo.

1395
00:54:06.355 --> 00:54:07.384
Okay.

1396
00:54:08.525 --> 00:54:09.625
Your voice was the loudest.

1397
00:54:10.254 --> 00:54:12.395
You shouted out her name.

1398
00:54:12.525 --> 00:54:13.525
Who will deliver it?

1399
00:54:13.526 --> 00:54:17.294
All right. You'll deliver
the trophy to Hyo Joo.

1400
00:54:17.295 --> 00:54:20.205
However, not everyone can go.

1401
00:54:20.504 --> 00:54:22.304
Do we have to win a game?

1402
00:54:22.335 --> 00:54:26.233
- Only one of you can go.
- My goodness.

1403
00:54:26.234 --> 00:54:28.303
If Dong Gu delivers it awkwardly,

1404
00:54:28.304 --> 00:54:29.444
it'd be the funniest.

1405
00:54:29.775 --> 00:54:31.874
Also, it'd look good if Dong Gyu goes.

1406
00:54:31.875 --> 00:54:34.314
- Who's Dong Gyu?
- I mean, Dong Gu.

1407
00:54:34.315 --> 00:54:37.983
Now, we'll play a game,
and the winner will...

1408
00:54:37.984 --> 00:54:40.983
deliver the trophy to Hyo Joo.

1409
00:54:40.984 --> 00:54:43.754
- It'd be awesome.
- I'm jealous already.

1410
00:54:43.795 --> 00:54:46.254
It's a simple game.

1411
00:54:46.295 --> 00:54:47.424
Throw it high.

1412
00:54:48.725 --> 00:54:51.594
("Don't Pop the Balloon")

1413
00:54:53.435 --> 00:54:57.004
(They'll catch the balloon
their opponent throws.)

1414
00:54:58.105 --> 00:55:03.245
(If the balloon pops, he loses the game.)

1415
00:55:03.944 --> 00:55:05.114
"Don't Pop the Balloon",

1416
00:55:05.275 --> 00:55:09.015
the winner will deliver
the trophy to Hyo Joo.

1417
00:55:09.114 --> 00:55:10.984
The winner will go to see Hyo Joo.

1418
00:55:11.185 --> 00:55:12.284
"The Way to Hyo Joo".

1419
00:55:13.015 --> 00:55:16.025
"The Way to Hyo Joo". Let's start the game.

1420
00:55:16.824 --> 00:55:19.594
("Don't Pop the Balloon")

1421
00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:21.994
Tae Hyun and Dong Gu will play first.

1422
00:55:21.995 --> 00:55:24.264
It's a ball game. Dong Gu might lose again.

1423
00:55:24.265 --> 00:55:25.295
It's a ball game indeed.

1424
00:55:25.694 --> 00:55:27.664
- Gosh, it's a ball game.
- Ball Gu.

1425
00:55:27.665 --> 00:55:29.303
- He's Ball Gu.
- Let's go!

1426
00:55:29.304 --> 00:55:31.503
- Here comes Ball Gu.
- Hey, Ball Gu.

1427
00:55:31.504 --> 00:55:32.504
Hardworking Ball Gu.

1428
00:55:32.505 --> 00:55:34.174
(He has all kinds of nicknames.)

1429
00:55:35.074 --> 00:55:36.144
- We'll start now.
- Let's go.

1430
00:55:36.145 --> 00:55:37.315
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1431
00:55:37.545 --> 00:55:38.785
It won't pop right away, right?

1432
00:55:39.275 --> 00:55:41.383
All right.

1433
00:55:41.384 --> 00:55:42.444
That was wonky.

1434
00:55:44.315 --> 00:55:45.315
He lost.

1435
00:55:45.315 --> 00:55:46.315
(What?)

1436
00:55:47.625 --> 00:55:50.295
(He lost to Ball Gu at once.)

1437
00:55:51.395 --> 00:55:53.864
(It's a lucky day for Dong Gu.)

1438
00:55:54.395 --> 00:55:56.093
Why? Why did it pop?

1439
00:55:56.094 --> 00:55:58.593
He's the most fertile one.

1440
00:55:58.594 --> 00:56:00.464
- The most fertile one.
- That's true.

1441
00:56:00.804 --> 00:56:02.604
- He's the most fertile.
- That's why it popped.

1442
00:56:02.605 --> 00:56:04.204
- The balloon popped.
- Of course.

1443
00:56:04.205 --> 00:56:05.874
The winner of Most Fertile
Award, Cha Tae Hyun.

1444
00:56:05.875 --> 00:56:07.403
(Most Fertile Award)

1445
00:56:07.404 --> 00:56:10.844
We all won the awards for a reason.

1446
00:56:10.915 --> 00:56:13.545
All right. Dong Gu moves
on to the semi-finals.

1447
00:56:14.145 --> 00:56:15.814
- My pants are all wet.
- It's this couple again.

1448
00:56:15.815 --> 00:56:16.883
What a nice couple.

1449
00:56:16.884 --> 00:56:18.654
Can I end the game at one go?

1450
00:56:19.214 --> 00:56:20.254
I'll beat you at once.

1451
00:56:21.625 --> 00:56:22.955
I have to go to see Hyo Joo.

1452
00:56:23.995 --> 00:56:25.194
Here we go.

1453
00:56:27.594 --> 00:56:28.594
I think he means it.

1454
00:56:28.595 --> 00:56:30.093
(I will be the one...)

1455
00:56:30.094 --> 00:56:32.765
(to gets to see Hyo Joo.)

1456
00:56:34.165 --> 00:56:35.165
I think he means it.

1457
00:56:37.435 --> 00:56:38.435
I think he means it.

1458
00:56:40.205 --> 00:56:41.673
(Joon Young loses.)

1459
00:56:41.674 --> 00:56:43.713
You have to fall backward like Jong Min.

1460
00:56:43.714 --> 00:56:45.914
- Jong Min won.
- You must use your body.

1461
00:56:45.915 --> 00:56:47.714
You should catch it with your body.

1462
00:56:47.915 --> 00:56:50.415
All right. The pitcher is Kim Joon Ho.

1463
00:56:50.714 --> 00:56:51.883
No, don't do that.

1464
00:56:51.884 --> 00:56:54.384
- I'll throw it this way.
- No.

1465
00:56:54.554 --> 00:56:58.795
Don't do that.

1466
00:57:04.194 --> 00:57:05.334
(Today's pose of chastity)

1467
00:57:05.335 --> 00:57:06.364
He did it.

1468
00:57:08.004 --> 00:57:09.464
You looked very chaste.

1469
00:57:10.105 --> 00:57:11.604
(He takes the pose again.)

1470
00:57:11.605 --> 00:57:13.104
- Chastity Award.
- Chastity Award.

1471
00:57:13.105 --> 00:57:15.045
- He looked chaste.
- That was good.

1472
00:57:15.344 --> 00:57:17.443
It might pop because of the microphone.

1473
00:57:17.444 --> 00:57:18.645
Go easy on him.

1474
00:57:19.315 --> 00:57:20.315
(Flinching)

1475
00:57:26.114 --> 00:57:28.254
(Heavy)

1476
00:57:28.855 --> 00:57:30.085
You looked chaste too.

1477
00:57:32.295 --> 00:57:33.664
(He gets ready to throw it upward.)

1478
00:57:33.665 --> 00:57:35.994
He's throwing it high. It'll pop this time.

1479
00:57:35.995 --> 00:57:37.495
(Anxious)

1480
00:57:39.194 --> 00:57:41.404
(He threw it too high that
it went out of the frame.)

1481
00:57:42.705 --> 00:57:45.174
(That's high!)

1482
00:57:46.504 --> 00:57:48.504
(Fly higher than anyone.)

1483
00:57:52.315 --> 00:57:54.214
(Surprised)

1484
00:57:55.015 --> 00:57:56.714
You should become a rugby player.

1485
00:57:57.884 --> 00:58:00.354
(He protected the balloon
with his chastity.)

1486
00:58:00.355 --> 00:58:01.585
I can't believe he did it.

1487
00:58:02.355 --> 00:58:03.694
Did you see it?

1488
00:58:03.895 --> 00:58:05.655
Maybe it's because he's
never hugged a girl.

1489
00:58:06.895 --> 00:58:08.693
That was his first hug.

1490
00:58:08.694 --> 00:58:09.863
(Chastity Award)

1491
00:58:09.864 --> 00:58:11.495
- That's how a hug feels.
- Stop it.

1492
00:58:12.194 --> 00:58:13.233
Here we go.

1493
00:58:13.234 --> 00:58:14.234
Let's go!

1494
00:58:14.804 --> 00:58:16.664
Here we go!

1495
00:58:16.665 --> 00:58:18.533
(He fires a cannon.)

1496
00:58:18.534 --> 00:58:19.704
That's crazy.

1497
00:58:19.705 --> 00:58:20.875
(Bombing)

1498
00:58:21.145 --> 00:58:22.645
- It didn't pop.
- He didn't lose.

1499
00:58:22.674 --> 00:58:23.975
(He flings it to the ground.)

1500
00:58:24.344 --> 00:58:26.274
- The balloon didn't pop.
- It didn't pop.

1501
00:58:26.275 --> 00:58:27.355
(It miraculously survived.)

1502
00:58:27.614 --> 00:58:29.984
It didn't pop. Goodness.

1503
00:58:30.614 --> 00:58:33.053
- Just throw it hard.
- You have no choice.

1504
00:58:33.054 --> 00:58:34.724
Hyo Joo.

1505
00:58:34.725 --> 00:58:36.455
- It'll pop now.
- Wait for me.

1506
00:58:38.025 --> 00:58:39.093
Upward?

1507
00:58:39.094 --> 00:58:40.295
(Take this.)

1508
00:58:41.225 --> 00:58:43.495
(Defconn fails to catch his fastball.)

1509
00:58:43.795 --> 00:58:45.395
Hyo Joo, wait for me!

1510
00:58:46.534 --> 00:58:48.133
I guess he really wanted to go.

1511
00:58:48.134 --> 00:58:49.364
It's coming to an end now.

1512
00:58:50.105 --> 00:58:53.134
(Dong Gu versus Jong Min versus Joon Ho)

1513
00:58:53.444 --> 00:58:54.874
Let's draw a triangle.

1514
00:58:54.875 --> 00:58:56.395
Let's throw it at the person you like.

1515
00:58:57.415 --> 00:58:58.515
That sounds fun.

1516
00:58:59.714 --> 00:59:03.514
Yes, if one of them loses,
it'll be the finals.

1517
00:59:03.515 --> 00:59:04.515
(I got it.)

1518
00:59:04.815 --> 00:59:07.783
Why are you signaling each
other with your faces?

1519
00:59:07.784 --> 00:59:10.354
It's because of my yellow teeth.

1520
00:59:10.355 --> 00:59:11.355
(That's a lousy excuse.)

1521
00:59:12.955 --> 00:59:13.964
Can I start now?

1522
00:59:16.424 --> 00:59:19.895
(Jong Min plays it in an
unbelievably smart way.)

1523
00:59:22.004 --> 00:59:23.874
(Dong Gu is lucky again.)

1524
00:59:23.875 --> 00:59:25.304
He somehow manages to catch it.

1525
00:59:25.705 --> 00:59:28.073
Go on. Throw it at him to make it funny.

1526
00:59:28.074 --> 00:59:29.875
(Dong Gu plays a trick too.)

1527
00:59:31.275 --> 00:59:33.174
- It looks strange.
- What's wrong with this?

1528
00:59:37.815 --> 00:59:41.984
- It looks strange.
- What's wrong with this?

1529
00:59:43.324 --> 00:59:44.324
What is this?

1530
00:59:45.225 --> 00:59:47.295
- It's a good balloon.
- What's that?

1531
00:59:47.395 --> 00:59:48.525
It has a strange shape.

1532
00:59:48.694 --> 00:59:49.694
Here we go.

1533
00:59:52.534 --> 00:59:53.534
Dong Gu!

1534
00:59:54.065 --> 00:59:55.903
(Dong Gu survives again.)

1535
00:59:55.904 --> 00:59:57.404
It won't pop. It's strange.

1536
00:59:58.534 --> 01:00:03.775
(Is it not going to pop forever?)

1537
01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:06.045
(Pop already!)

1538
01:00:09.045 --> 01:00:10.214
- All right.
- What?

1539
01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:12.214
(What?)

1540
01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:18.194
(He did catch it, )

1541
01:00:20.395 --> 01:00:23.395
(but the balloon slipped.)

1542
01:00:26.234 --> 01:00:27.903
(Dazed)

1543
01:00:27.904 --> 01:00:30.475
- It ended unexpectedly.
- He overdid it.

1544
01:00:30.504 --> 01:00:33.275
- It's the final game.
- Dong Gu might win.

1545
01:00:34.174 --> 01:00:36.875
I didn't interview her
well on the plane before.

1546
01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:39.874
I'll go and ask her all of
my questions this time.

1547
01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:40.884
All right.

1548
01:00:41.384 --> 01:00:43.045
- Wait for me.
- Dong Gu is doing great.

1549
01:00:43.315 --> 01:00:45.314
Will Dong Gu surprisingly win a ball game?

1550
01:00:45.315 --> 01:00:46.983
If I win this game,

1551
01:00:46.984 --> 01:00:49.525
it will be the most overwhelming thing.

1552
01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:52.093
Throw it low at first.

1553
01:00:52.094 --> 01:00:53.924
- Lightly.
- That's right.

1554
01:00:54.525 --> 01:00:58.265
(The rally goes on for
long as it's the finals.)

1555
01:00:59.165 --> 01:01:01.034
(Are they meerkats?)

1556
01:01:01.705 --> 01:01:02.904
It looks like a rugby ball.

1557
01:01:03.265 --> 01:01:05.673
(Why are you so good, Dong Gu?)

1558
01:01:05.674 --> 01:01:06.874
- Good job.
- You're good.

1559
01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:08.744
There he goes.

1560
01:01:08.745 --> 01:01:10.474
There he goes.

1561
01:01:10.475 --> 01:01:12.713
(It didn't pop yet.)

1562
01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:13.844
Goodness.

1563
01:01:14.444 --> 01:01:15.545
(Screaming)

1564
01:01:17.984 --> 01:01:18.984
What happened?

1565
01:01:20.924 --> 01:01:21.924
What happened?

1566
01:01:23.254 --> 01:01:25.294
(The balloon becomes strange again.)

1567
01:01:25.295 --> 01:01:26.295
What happened?

1568
01:01:27.924 --> 01:01:30.234
- It will pop soon.
- It will.

1569
01:01:31.364 --> 01:01:32.835
- That's right.
- It's the end.

1570
01:01:33.534 --> 01:01:35.463
It still didn't pop. It's persistent.

1571
01:01:35.464 --> 01:01:37.304
- That's interesting.
- Throw it hard.

1572
01:01:37.734 --> 01:01:40.004
(Will the water balloon
be on Dong Gu's side?)

1573
01:01:45.545 --> 01:01:48.314
(The balloon definitely popped.)

1574
01:01:48.315 --> 01:01:50.214
- Come on.
- What happened?

1575
01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:54.954
- Come on.
- What happened?

1576
01:01:54.955 --> 01:01:56.484
- Who won?
- What happened?

1577
01:01:57.795 --> 01:02:00.054
The water splashed on him.

1578
01:02:00.665 --> 01:02:02.725
- Did you record it?
- Who's the winner?

1579
01:02:04.864 --> 01:02:07.134
(Dong Gu loses.)

1580
01:02:07.364 --> 01:02:10.704
It's unclear. Did Dong Gu lose?

1581
01:02:10.705 --> 01:02:12.934
- Yes.
- Didn't Dong Gu lose?

1582
01:02:12.935 --> 01:02:15.545
- Jong Min barely won.
- How?

1583
01:02:16.004 --> 01:02:17.114
Right?

1584
01:02:17.214 --> 01:02:18.744
(He won anyway.)

1585
01:02:18.745 --> 01:02:19.745
Hyo Joo.

1586
01:02:20.784 --> 01:02:22.645
- It feels awkward.
- It's quite awkward.

1587
01:02:23.284 --> 01:02:25.314
- It feels awkward.
- They can become friends.

1588
01:02:25.315 --> 01:02:26.685
It's a chance to become friends.

1589
01:02:27.284 --> 01:02:30.923
There's something more to
his meeting with Hyo Joo.

1590
01:02:30.924 --> 01:02:32.524
As Jong Min is the winner,

1591
01:02:32.525 --> 01:02:35.364
he'll deliver the trophy to Han Hyo Joo.

1592
01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:37.494
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1593
01:02:37.495 --> 01:02:39.193
(It's worrisome.)

1594
01:02:39.194 --> 01:02:41.964
- You were so awkward.
- I know.

1595
01:02:43.364 --> 01:02:45.335
(He interviewed Hyo Joo last spring.)

1596
01:02:46.605 --> 01:02:48.844
(Now, Jeju Island, are
you wearing no makeup?)

1597
01:02:50.174 --> 01:02:52.775
(He stammers and dances instead.)

1598
01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:55.614
(She's flustered.)

1599
01:02:56.855 --> 01:03:00.053
(He gets macaron from friendly Hyo Joo.)

1600
01:03:00.054 --> 01:03:01.085
I felt so nervous.

1601
01:03:01.185 --> 01:03:02.725
(He blushes.)

1602
01:03:04.194 --> 01:03:07.995
There's another task for other members.

1603
01:03:08.594 --> 01:03:12.733
We've had guests from
the public on the show.

1604
01:03:12.734 --> 01:03:14.904
- Do you remember Ms. Kim?
- Right.

1605
01:03:15.165 --> 01:03:16.904
Joon Ho can go to Neubdari.

1606
01:03:17.534 --> 01:03:18.574

1768
01:11:44.515 --> 01:11:45.674
Please open it.

1769
01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:47.414
Please open it.

1770
01:11:47.515 --> 01:11:49.985
- "Follow one member".
- "Follow one member".

1771
01:11:50.485 --> 01:11:51.884
Will it be three people then?

1772
01:11:52.015 --> 01:11:53.984
It will be three people in the team.

1773
01:11:53.985 --> 01:11:56.083
- I...
- This is funny.

1774
01:11:56.084 --> 01:11:58.124
I think I can be your good partner.

1775
01:11:58.195 --> 01:11:59.894
I have a good feeling. Come to me.

1776
01:11:59.895 --> 01:12:01.593
Joon Young isn't so lucky these days.

1777
01:12:01.594 --> 01:12:02.594
He's also unlucky.

1778
01:12:02.595 --> 01:12:04.264
What are you saying? I always win games.

1779
01:12:04.265 --> 01:12:05.395
He's unlucky.

1780
01:12:05.834 --> 01:12:07.164
He's unlucky.

1781
01:12:07.535 --> 01:12:08.803
I'll pick Tae Hyun.

1782
01:12:08.804 --> 01:12:11.034
It's safe to choose him.

1783
01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.904
I'd like to go with Tae Hyun.

1784
01:12:12.905 --> 01:12:14.425
Come here. We're now in the same team.

1785
01:12:14.975 --> 01:12:16.415
What if he has got the same mission?

1786
01:12:16.744 --> 01:12:17.873
What if we all got the same mission?

1787
01:12:17.874 --> 01:12:19.444
(Maybe we all got the same mission.)

1788
01:12:19.445 --> 01:12:20.615
What about Hyo Joo then?

1789
01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:22.825
Maybe the last one tells
you to follow Hyo Joo.

1790
01:12:22.985 --> 01:12:24.253
We can all go meet Hyo Joo then.

1791
01:12:24.254 --> 01:12:25.654
(Was that what this was all about?)

1792
01:12:25.914 --> 01:12:27.025
I'm going to open mine.

1793
01:12:28.384 --> 01:12:30.155
There is something in mine.

1794
01:12:30.594 --> 01:12:32.424
Something big.

1795
01:12:32.794 --> 01:12:33.864
The letters are big.

1796
01:12:33.865 --> 01:12:36.395
What is it? Show us. 1, 2, 3.

1797
01:12:36.994 --> 01:12:38.493
- 1, 2, 3.
- Share with us.

1798
01:12:38.494 --> 01:12:40.093
- Open it.
- What is this?

1799
01:12:40.094 --> 01:12:41.303
There's a question mark.

1800
01:12:41.304 --> 01:12:43.604
- Open it.
- What is it?

1801
01:12:43.605 --> 01:12:45.605
- Keep opening.
- What is that?

1802
01:12:47.475 --> 01:12:48.715
- What is that?
- What is that?

1803
01:12:49.204 --> 01:12:50.274
What does a question mark on a person mean?

1804
01:12:50.275 --> 01:12:51.475
A question mark means...

1805
01:12:51.914 --> 01:12:56.285
Defconn can meet one of the guests we had.

1806
01:12:56.714 --> 01:12:58.454
- I wish I chose him.
- That's a good one.

1807
01:12:59.054 --> 01:13:01.384
It doesn't matter if
it's a celebrity or not.

1808
01:13:01.884 --> 01:13:03.994
- Really?
- It's so good.

1809
01:13:04.094 --> 01:13:05.354
Any of the guests we had.

1810
01:13:05.355 --> 01:13:08.225
Defconn, go to Washington to meet Roy.

1811
01:13:09.025 --> 01:13:10.334
Go to Washington.

1812
01:13:10.834 --> 01:13:11.895
- Defconn.
- I told you.

1813
01:13:12.365 --> 01:13:14.365
I told you we should choose Defconn!

1814
01:13:15.535 --> 01:13:17.204
I told you we should choose Defconn!

1815
01:13:19.304 --> 01:13:20.775
I'm free from them!

1816
01:13:21.504 --> 01:13:22.544
How about visiting Bo Gum?

1817
01:13:23.975 --> 01:13:25.243
It's...

1818
01:13:25.244 --> 01:13:27.114
- It's Joon Young's turn.
- His is amazing.

1819
01:13:27.115 --> 01:13:28.684
- What's written in it?
- What does it say?

1820
01:13:28.685 --> 01:13:29.685
This is amazing.

1821
01:13:29.686 --> 01:13:31.754
My goodness.

1822
01:13:31.884 --> 01:13:32.953
What was that?

1823
01:13:32.954 --> 01:13:34.484
I saw "all six members".

1824
01:13:34.485 --> 01:13:37.053
It's written "all six members".

1825
01:13:37.054 --> 01:13:38.993
- Calm down.
- I saw the first letter.

1826
01:13:38.994 --> 01:13:40.793
Do you think you drew a wrong one?

1827
01:13:40.794 --> 01:13:41.825
It was "Gim".

1828
01:13:42.964 --> 01:13:44.234
- Gimje?
- Gimje?

1829
01:13:44.235 --> 01:13:46.434
Is it Gimje?
- 1, 2, 3!

1830
01:13:46.435 --> 01:13:49.333
Visit all six grandmothers in Gimje.

1831
01:13:49.334 --> 01:13:51.503
Give them presents to
show our appreciation.

1832
01:13:51.504 --> 01:13:54.344
Visit one grandmother to help her out.

1833
01:13:55.174 --> 01:13:57.914
- Yes!
- Kim Joon Ho!

1834
01:13:58.115 --> 01:14:00.044
- Kim Joon Ho!
- I'm happy for him.

1835
01:14:00.445 --> 01:14:02.445
I'm so jealous.

1836
01:14:03.754 --> 01:14:05.354
That was surprising.

1837
01:14:05.355 --> 01:14:07.484
It's our 10th anniversary, isn't it?

1838
01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:09.924
- But...
- How nice it is.

1839
01:14:10.395 --> 01:14:12.854
I told you I wanted to visit them.

1840
01:14:12.855 --> 01:14:14.864
But if he's visiting them,
I can't visit them.

1841
01:14:14.865 --> 01:14:17.134
I'm so jealous you're going to meet them...

1842
01:14:17.235 --> 01:14:19.133
although helping them
with work might be tough.

1843
01:14:19.134 --> 01:14:21.104
Now, we have two people left.

1844
01:14:21.105 --> 01:14:22.234
Please.

1845
01:14:22.235 --> 01:14:24.974
- Please.
- The letters are big.

1846
01:14:24.975 --> 01:14:28.144
- Neubdari.
- Neubdari.

1847
01:14:28.145 --> 01:14:31.913
- Neubdari.
- Neubdari.

1848
01:14:31.914 --> 01:14:33.843
What's on it?

1849
01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:34.844
A person plus a person?

1850
01:14:35.344 --> 01:14:39.254
(What does this mean?)

1851
01:14:40.155 --> 01:14:43.355
Visit two guests you can think of...

1852
01:14:47.365 --> 01:14:50.695
Let's go to my place and
meet Tae Eun and Soo Chan.

1853
01:14:51.594 --> 01:14:53.164
They are the best guests!

1854
01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:56.065
He has the best one.

1855
01:14:56.504 --> 01:14:58.133
They can meet both guests at once.

1856
01:14:58.134 --> 01:14:59.774
Visiting 1 place is
deemed visiting 1 person.

1857
01:14:59.775 --> 01:15:00.904
That sounds fair.

1858
01:15:00.905 --> 01:15:02.104
Then...

1859
01:15:02.105 --> 01:15:03.444
let's go to my place and...

1860
01:15:03.445 --> 01:15:06.173
have lunch with Tae Eun and Soo Chan first.

1861
01:15:06.174 --> 01:15:08.184
Then let's go either meet Bo Gum...

1862
01:15:08.185 --> 01:15:10.014
- or In Sung.
- That sounds good.

1863
01:15:10.015 --> 01:15:11.384
Choose anyone you like.

1864
01:15:11.785 --> 01:15:13.115
Okay, that sounds good.

1865
01:15:13.554 --> 01:15:15.524
We can meet Bo Young on the way.

1866
01:15:15.525 --> 01:15:17.005
(We can stop by at Bo Young's place.)

1867
01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:19.094
Please draw 10 people on our card.

1868
01:15:19.424 --> 01:15:22.194
We will meet Bo Young and...

1869
01:15:22.195 --> 01:15:23.293
- Is it okay...
- Let's visit 10 people.

1870
01:15:23.294 --> 01:15:24.664
For us to follow you guys?

1871
01:15:25.094 --> 01:15:26.294
Can we just follow you?

1872
01:15:26.594 --> 01:15:28.963
Let's go meet Hyo Joo together.

1873
01:15:28.964 --> 01:15:30.803
Theirs look better.

1874
01:15:30.804 --> 01:15:32.104
You're not going to meet
Hyung Don, are you?

1875
01:15:32.105 --> 01:15:33.674
It has to be one of our guests.

1876
01:15:33.704 --> 01:15:35.144
Defconn, have you made up your mind?

1877
01:15:35.575 --> 01:15:36.914
- I haven't yet.
- I see.

1878
01:15:37.075 --> 01:15:38.914
I'll take my time.

1879
01:15:39.174 --> 01:15:40.414
All right.

1880
01:15:41.414 --> 01:15:42.784
(Please look forward to
their delivery service.)

1881
01:15:42.785 --> 01:15:44.615
I told you I'm lucky.

1882
01:15:45.254 --> 01:15:47.584
- I am lucky.
- We're so lucky.

1883
01:15:50.195 --> 01:15:53.224
(Lastly, they got comments
from the viewers.)

1884
01:15:53.225 --> 01:15:54.265
They're really focused.

1885
01:15:57.164 --> 01:15:59.534
"Dong Gu is made up of
one percent charm..."

1886
01:15:59.535 --> 01:16:02.605
"and 99 percent clumsiness."

1887
01:16:03.105 --> 01:16:04.734
It doesn't matter as long
as you are good-looking.

1888
01:16:04.735 --> 01:16:06.503
He's a clumsy man.

1889
01:16:06.504 --> 01:16:08.003
"Joon Ho is a mirror ball."

1890
01:16:08.004 --> 01:16:11.975
"Once the switch is on, he goes childish."

1891
01:16:12.174 --> 01:16:13.414
He is childish.

1892
01:16:13.584 --> 01:16:15.115
- A mirror ball?
- Yes, a mirror ball.

1893
01:16:15.544 --> 01:16:17.185
"Tae Hyun is an accelerator."

1894
01:16:18.254 --> 01:16:20.155
"When one member starts a joke,"

1895
01:16:20.754 --> 01:16:23.423
"he accelerates it by joining."

1896
01:16:23.424 --> 01:16:26.253
- That's so true.
- He makes it funnier.

1897
01:16:26.254 --> 01:16:27.395
It's all because of you.

1898
01:16:28.065 --> 01:16:29.093
It's because of you!

1899
01:16:29.094 --> 01:16:31.065
He's the problem.

1900
01:16:31.594 --> 01:16:32.594
You're the host.

1901
01:16:32.895 --> 01:16:34.163
You make things bigger.

1902
01:16:34.164 --> 01:16:35.964
Whenever I try to make some jokes,

1903
01:16:36.004 --> 01:16:37.873
he always comes and joins.

1904
01:16:37.874 --> 01:16:39.074
I didn't know I was doing that.

1905
01:16:39.075 --> 01:16:40.645
He's like a parasite.

1906
01:16:40.844 --> 01:16:42.775
Are you a host or what?

1907
01:16:43.145 --> 01:16:46.075
"Defconn is a cute man who is serious."

1908
01:16:46.914 --> 01:16:48.384
"Not like his weight,"

1909
01:16:48.815 --> 01:16:50.883
"he has a lot of concerns
like a little bird."

1910
01:16:50.884 --> 01:16:52.485
I think it's charming.

1911
01:16:52.954 --> 01:16:55.654
It's cute everyone makes
fun of him being a single.

1912
01:16:55.655 --> 01:16:56.725
I agree.

1913
01:16:56.754 --> 01:16:58.194
- I see.
- We know it.

1914
01:16:58.195 --> 01:16:59.294
Thank you.

1915
01:16:59.525 --> 01:17:01.825
"Joon Young is CA."

1916
01:17:02.624 --> 01:17:04.093
"He's crazy but attractive."

1917
01:17:04.094 --> 01:17:05.634
(Joon Young is crazy but attractive.)

1918
01:17:05.794 --> 01:17:07.105
I can't read it myself.

1919
01:17:07.134 --> 01:17:08.703
- Dong go.
- Read it for him.

1920
01:17:08.704 --> 01:17:11.275
Dong Gu, please read it in a small voice.

1921
01:17:11.334 --> 01:17:13.575
"Jong Min's a wild ginseng
that is 10 years old."

1922
01:17:13.744 --> 01:17:15.673
"There is a big difference between..."

1923
01:17:15.674 --> 01:17:17.413
"a 1-year-old ginseng and
a 10-year-old ginseng."

1924
01:17:17.414 --> 01:17:19.043
"Jong Min has been constantly..."

1925
01:17:19.044 --> 01:17:21.944
"doing well for 10 years
