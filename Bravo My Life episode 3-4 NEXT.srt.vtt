00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.489
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.269
I'm here.

3
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.549
- Director Ha. - You're fired.

4
00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.149
Director Ha.

5
00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:41.520
You didn't even hand in your assignment. Why should I keep you?

6
00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.960
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.929
I get nervous in front of the camera.

8
00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.130
Look at this punk.

9
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.770
You have so many ways of ridiculing me.

10
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.700
Have you never taken a selfie before?

11
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.140
No.

12
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.439
Hey. That's why I gave you that assignment, got it?

13
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.109
I'll give you another day.

14
00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:14.290
If you don't send it to me by tomorrow, I'll never see you again.

15
00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:19.519
What is wrong with this guy?

16
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.420
Are you training Bum Woo well?

17
00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.299
I told him to record his daily life and sent it to my email,

18
00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.670
but he said he gets nervous in front of the camera.

19
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.340
So? Do you want to give up?

20
00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.639
He's not fit for it. You can't do anything.

21
00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.150
I'll find a way.

22
00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.020
(Jung Sung Ah)

23
00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.430
The fact is that

24
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.360
You are more attracted to me

25
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.129
Your girl is looking in the mirror right now

26
00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.340
Putting red lipstick on, baby

27
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.250
Her feet probably hurt from the high heels

28
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.330
Challenges are my destiny.

29
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.000
Cut. Okay.

30
00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.840
- Great job, Do Hyun. - Thank you.

31
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.210
Let's go one more time.

32
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.349
That one was good.

33
00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.419
I want...

34
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.990
him to be more certain.

35
00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.629
Do Hyun, can we go another time?

36
00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.300
Sure.

37
00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.639
- Can we take a break? - Should we?

38
00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.340
Mr. Seol Do Hyun.

39
00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.610
That one was good. Let's keep going.

40
00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.680
I need a minute.

41
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.180
We'll be back quickly.

42
00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.919
They'll get a divorce.

43
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.930
- Really? - Yes.

44
00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:11.430
They're in the initial stage.

45
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.269
How did they decide on it so quickly?

46
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:20.269
Please don't ask. You have to wait a little more.

47
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.949
- Mr. Park. - Yes.

48
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.920
I'm going to be the mom of JU Group's successor.

49
00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.490
You should know who to line up with.

50
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.529
What?

51
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.670
We can't go on a honeymoon?

52
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.110
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:57.509
It overlaps with the release of a new product.

54
00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.610
Let's go on our honeymoon when we have time.

55
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.420
You run a business, so you should know.

56
00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:10.959
Please be understanding.

57
00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:15.459
All right.

58
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.230
I knew you would understand. This is why I decided...

59
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.970
to marry you the moment I saw you.

60
00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.040
Thank you.

61
00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.149
I work part-time as a chauffeur.

62
00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:44.720
I was so nervous,

63
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.560
so I came to get medicine to help me relax.

64
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.860
(Plus Pharmacy)

65
00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:53.360
I woke up at 11am and had breakfast.

66
00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.829
I always run two hours along the Han River.

67
00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:58.439
If there's a job,

68
00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.470
then I go and work.

69
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.509
I don't have any skills,

70
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.009
so it's usually physical labour.

71
00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.750
I normally sleep around 8am.

72
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.550
How many hours does he sleep then?

73
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.930
Hello.

74
00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:26.730
Did you follow me all the way here?

75
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.699
I'm here for some other business.

76
00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.000
Why would you come to a station for?

77
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.110
I'm participating in an audition program.

78
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.110
You're a judge for that show.

79
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.680
Since you won't take a woman as your pupil,

80
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.009
this is the best I can do.

81
00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:45.350
Jung Sung Ah.

82
00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:47.889
You won't make it to the show with your abilities.

83
00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.149
We'll see.

84
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.160
Bye.

85
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.500
- Hey. - Are you here?

86
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.639
Have you been well?

87
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.240
I've been meaning to visit whenever I visit the station.

88
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.879
We all know you're busy.

89
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.579
Gosh.

90
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.449
As I mentioned, you should do this drama.

91
00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:18.180
That drama?

92
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.990
The schedule is tight,

93
00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:23.560
but I'll do it if you ask me.

94
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.889
Can't you just accept it without being such a jerk?

95
00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:28.490
I have a reputation to uphold.

96
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.899
Hey, come meet our music director.

97
00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:36.230
You must know him since he's so famous.

98
00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:39.000
- I'm Ha Do Na. - She's the production assistant.

99
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.910
- Let's do our best, Do Na. - Yes.

100
00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:44.740
Okay.

101
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.920
Hey, shouldn't you be editing?

102
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.920
Have you figured anything out to help me build self-esteem?

103
00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:03.029
That's not important right now.

104
00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:05.500
- Come over here. - What is it?

105
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.399
They say it's a female producer of "S" broadcasting studio.

106
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.029
They already have your name up.

107
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.069
(Does the Chairman's Wife of Juvis Group Have a Daughter?)

108
00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:18.910
Did you know about this?

109
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.110
About what?

110
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.250
You said you used to have a mom.

111
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.250
Hey! There's no such thing.

112
00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.389
Gosh.

113
00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:38.899
Mom.

114
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.700
What is it at this hour?

115
00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:46.639
- What is it? - Look at it yourself.

116
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.009
(Does the Chairman's Wife of Juvis Group Have a Daughter?)

117
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.149
What is this?

118
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.279
What is this about?

119
00:09:01.289 --> 00:09:03.350
My in-laws would have found out.

120
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.690
How can I see Joon Ho and his parents?

121
00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:10.059
Is that the problem right now?

122
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.860
I might get a divorce.

123
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.529
A divorce? That's obvious.

124
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.470
So that's why Dad is in Japan.

125
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.039
How can you do this to me and Dad?

126
00:09:20.169 --> 00:09:21.309
I'm sorry,

127
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.080
but couldn't you be considerate of me?

128
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.710
How can you say that right now?

129
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.779
My life is ruined because of you.

130
00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:34.220
You're driving me crazy.

131
00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:45.299
(Chicken Kalguksu)

132
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.700
Are you going to eat?

133
00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:50.870
- Grandma. - Yes?

134
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.509
- Grandma. - I heard you.

135
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.879
Do you know someone named Lara?

136
00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:06.350
She's the wife of JU Group's chairman...

137
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:09.320
and she was cast in three films Dad directed.

138
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.620
Do you know her?

139
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.559
Why are you bringing her up?

140
00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:18.330
An article went up...

141
00:10:19.299 --> 00:10:22.200
on the Internet saying that I might be...

142
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:24.539
her daughter.

143
00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:26.240
What?

144
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.710
It was on the news?

145
00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:34.049
It's not true, is it?

146
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.879
Is it a false report?

147
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.980
Tell me that it is.

148
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.649
Was it you?

149
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.549
I'm sorry. She was very firm.

150
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.350
From now on,

151
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.990
don't act so rashly.

152
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.730
This is a warning.

153
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.759
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:35.539
Honey.

155
00:11:42.409 --> 00:11:43.980
Did you have to do that?

156
00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:45.980
I won't make excuses.

157
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.690
It would hurt my child...

158
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.090
Do you only care about how she would feel?

159
00:11:51.159 --> 00:11:53.490
Don't you care about how you shamed me...

160
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.090
in front of the world?

161
00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:56.789
You promised to keep it a secret...

162
00:11:56.789 --> 00:11:58.730
I'll announce the divorce publicly tomorrow.

163
00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:01.100
Honey.

164
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.169
You know I can't live without you.

165
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.940
Honey, please calm down, and listen to me.

166
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:12.409
Why should I listen to you?

167
00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:16.149
I truly loved you.

168
00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:18.350
That hasn't changed.

169
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.389
Do you think...

170
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.759
I can believe in your words?

171
00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:25.889
- It's the truth. - No.

172
00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:28.929
You gave your innocence to someone else,

173
00:12:29.289 --> 00:12:32.000
and you approached me as a cunning woman.

174
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.970
No, that's not true.

175
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.769
Let's stop here.

176
00:12:36.669 --> 00:12:39.600
I can't stand the fact that I'm having this conversation right now.

177
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:41.539
Honey...

178
00:12:43.169 --> 00:12:44.740
Please, think it over.

179
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.049
I can only live under your protection.

180
00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:50.250
How can I live without...

181
00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.519
You can live with your daughter now.

182
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:20.409
We should annul the wedding, right?

183
00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:23.710
No. Hold on.

184
00:14:24.179 --> 00:14:26.509
I'm not sure if this puts us in any harm.

185
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:28.710
Mom, it's humiliating.

186
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.750
Can you really take her in as your daughter-in-law?

187
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.580
We should think about what will benefit us.

188
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.820
You've been living as a businessman's wife for many years.

189
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.220
I guess you're finally able to think properly.

190
00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.379
Do Na.

191
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.179
Grandma.

192
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.320
You're the only mother I have.

193
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.149
So let's act...

194
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.529
like nothing ever happened.

195
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.330
Good night.

196
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:31.539
You have a busy future ahead of you.

197
00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:33.580
- Thank you. - I'll look forward to your work.

198
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.419
Hearing Ms. Shin confidently tell us that...

199
00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:39.179
she got married to acting...

200
00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:42.990
makes me admire her for being such a competent woman.

201
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.690
I wonder how our viewers felt.

202
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.490
We'll end our show here today. I hope you all have a great morning.

203
00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:53.129
Thank you. Good work.

204
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.500
- Thank you for your cooperation. - Thank you.

205
00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:57.399
I don't know if I did well today.

206
00:15:57.399 --> 00:15:59.440
You did well. I feel like today's episode will have high ratings.

207
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.809
- Do you think so? - Yes. Goodbye.

208
00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:01.840
Bye.

209
00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:05.110
- Hi, Ms. Shin. - Hey.

210
00:16:05.139 --> 00:16:07.179
Here's your script for episode three.

211
00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:08.379
It's out already?

212
00:16:08.409 --> 00:16:10.419
I'll see you at the rehearsal.

213
00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:11.820
Wait.

214
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.450
I used to be best friends with Lara.

215
00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:19.419
We debuted together...

216
00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:22.659
and even appeared on a few of your dad's movies together.

217
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:30.700
I see. I'll be off then.

218
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.970
Yes, okay.

219
00:16:55.789 --> 00:17:02.599
(Head Director, Kim Joon Ho)

220
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.670
JU Group just officially announced the chairman's divorce.

221
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.869
I guess it wasn't just a rumour.

222
00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:11.109
Are you going to go ahead with the wedding?

223
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.210
I don't have the power to make that choice.

224
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.920
My parents will decide for me.

225
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.180
I...

226
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.490
don't think it's a bad idea to get married to her.

227
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.359
You'll be at an advantage because of her weakness.

228
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.980
(Juvis Group)

229
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.180
I'm here.

230
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.319
What do you want?

231
00:17:51.319 --> 00:17:54.150
I wanted to ask why you couldn't delay the divorce announcement.

232
00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:56.250
You could've done it after my wedding.

233
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.259
It's better than getting married amidst these rumours.

234
00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:04.299
I have no intentions on sitting next to your mother during the wedding.

235
00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:08.430
I think it's always best to get things over with.

236
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.940
Dad.

237
00:18:15.809 --> 00:18:19.279
Will my position remain the same?

238
00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:23.309
What are you worried about?

239
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.990
You're the one and only competent heir...

240
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.420
of JU Group.

241
00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:35.829
Okay.

242
00:18:37.099 --> 00:18:38.359
I'll get back to work.

243
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.589
Ma'am.

244
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.819
I moved all your luggage to the suite at Giant Hotel.

245
00:19:50.769 --> 00:19:53.769
Regardless of whatever others might say about you,

246
00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:55.369
you don't need to be discouraged.

247
00:19:55.369 --> 00:19:56.980
None of this was your fault.

248
00:19:57.309 --> 00:19:58.710
Mother.

249
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.609
You're our family's daughter-in-law.

250
00:20:02.779 --> 00:20:05.980
From now on, I'll become your mother.

251
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.150
That means we're going to protect you from all of your hardships.

252
00:20:11.289 --> 00:20:12.319
Mother.

253
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.240
I'm just keeping my distance from him for a while.

254
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.410
I'll be able to go back soon.

255
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.109
Whatever that's happening right now is just a temporary storm.

256
00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:46.789
Here you go. I made you some healthy juice.

257
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.930
Are you still looking at that?

258
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.099
Do Na.

259
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.970
She's becoming more and more interesting.

260
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.240
Are you more interested in the production assistant than Acanthus?

261
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.970
I know how to draw a line between public and private matters.

262
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.180
And I'm saying you seem to be overly interested in her.

263
00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.680
Why are you always sticking around?

264
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.650
Hwa Im's also our agency's actress.

265
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.619
She never causes trouble.

266
00:21:12.619 --> 00:21:13.750
What?

267
00:21:14.849 --> 00:21:17.990
Does that mean I'm someone who always causes trouble?

268
00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:19.059
No.

269
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:22.430
I'm just worried about you like a brother.

270
00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:24.930
And...

271
00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:27.970
I really like being next to you.

272
00:21:29.829 --> 00:21:32.269
What's wrong with you? That's disgusting.

273
00:21:35.569 --> 00:21:39.079
You need to be determined to fall from here.

274
00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:43.250
Hey, wait. Hey, Bum Woo.

275
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.450
I wasn't trying to tell you to jump off and die. Get down here.

276
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.490
I think...

277
00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:52.289
I've been up here around four times.

278
00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:58.200
I came up here every time I thought I'd never make it.

279
00:22:01.569 --> 00:22:05.200
Okay, I get it. Let's talk down here.

280
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.309
But I couldn't jump off.

281
00:22:09.609 --> 00:22:12.279
Yes, of course. You shouldn't just kill yourself like that.

282
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.250
I had this small hope thinking that I might be able to succeed.

283
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.480
Yes, of course. You'll be able to make it.

284
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.119
You're even able to take selfies now.

285
00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:22.789
You took your first step.

286
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.819
Bum Woo, get down here.

287
00:22:34.329 --> 00:22:36.170
What is your problem?

288
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.269
Do you know how startled I was?

289
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.779
I'm scared.

290
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.990
I'm scared that everything will end up being...

291
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.160
false hope.

292
00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:19.779
Let's begin.

293
00:23:20.349 --> 00:23:23.779
The camera's rolling. This is the actual shooting.

294
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.150
I'm Kim Bum Woo.

295
00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.920
I have nothing to fear.

296
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.859
You can all point your fingers at me.

297
00:24:13.059 --> 00:24:14.299
But I'm still going to...

298
00:24:15.769 --> 00:24:17.970
live my life passionately!

299
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.009
Drink it.

300
00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:06.779
What am I supposed to do with you now?

301
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.150
Even...

302
00:25:11.589 --> 00:25:13.289
Even what?

303
00:25:14.589 --> 00:25:16.329
Even if I can't do it,

304
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.529
thank you.

305
00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:27.210
Why do you think you can't do it?

306
00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:29.509
You can do it.

307
00:25:29.509 --> 00:25:32.009
Tell yourself. "I can do it."

308
00:25:32.009 --> 00:25:33.809
Say it. "I can do it."

309
00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:37.319
I can do it.

310
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.950
See?

311
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.150
You did it.

312
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:50.430
When things don't go as planned,

313
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:54.200
you need to reassure yourself like that.

314
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:56.970
Okay.

315
00:25:58.869 --> 00:26:00.210
But it's hard...

316
00:26:01.509 --> 00:26:03.410
to convince yourself.

317
00:26:05.339 --> 00:26:06.740
I think so too.

318
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.250
It'll drive you nuts if you don't do it,

319
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.950
so that's why you do it.

320
00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:24.430
Do you do that too?

321
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.200
What?

322
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:30.740
Well...

323
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.779
Everybody has moments like that.

324
00:26:40.349 --> 00:26:42.880
I don't think you need to.

325
00:26:45.349 --> 00:26:46.549
I think...

326
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.859
you were born with courage.

327
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.759
Do you think so?

328
00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.160
Yes.

329
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:06.910
You're right. I only have courage.

330
00:27:10.309 --> 00:27:12.640
I'm a person with courage!

331
00:27:25.734 --> 00:27:27.963
(Episode 4)

332
00:27:38.944 --> 00:27:40.074
Is it Sung Ah?

333
00:27:42.644 --> 00:27:43.844
Hold on.

334
00:27:49.884 --> 00:27:51.454
Welcome. Come in.

335
00:28:00.193 --> 00:28:01.464
Why are you here?

336
00:28:02.134 --> 00:28:04.104
I got divorced. Where am I supposed to go?

337
00:28:06.134 --> 00:28:08.943
- Do you have a lot of money? - Your dad gave me enough.

338
00:28:08.943 --> 00:28:12.543
You have to live all your life with it. Why are you here?

339
00:28:12.543 --> 00:28:14.784
I won't stay here for long.

340
00:28:14.784 --> 00:28:16.814
I'm going back to your dad soon.

341
00:28:17.854 --> 00:28:20.723
Mom, don't you know him?

342
00:28:20.723 --> 00:28:23.354
He's only satisfied once he dominates the world.

343
00:28:23.354 --> 00:28:25.123
That's why I left.

344
00:28:25.423 --> 00:28:27.793
You shook up his world and got thrown out.

345
00:28:27.793 --> 00:28:30.324
But you're going back to him?

346
00:28:34.164 --> 00:28:36.304
I didn't want to eat alone so I told you to come.

347
00:28:37.104 --> 00:28:38.903
Let's go down and eat.

348
00:28:40.074 --> 00:28:41.804
I told you to wake up.

349
00:28:42.143 --> 00:28:45.843
You can never go back to Father. You have to survive on your own.

350
00:28:45.843 --> 00:28:47.143
That's not true.

351
00:28:47.483 --> 00:28:49.184
I know him well.

352
00:28:49.184 --> 00:28:51.283
- Do you believe that? - Yes.

353
00:28:51.283 --> 00:28:53.214
Then practice eating by yourself.

354
00:28:55.324 --> 00:28:57.824
Sung Ah. Sung Ah.

355
00:29:03.024 --> 00:29:04.393
You guys don't know...

356
00:29:05.834 --> 00:29:08.334
how much we loved each other.

357
00:29:20.313 --> 00:29:23.114
I think it's time for me to leave, so I'm leaving.

358
00:29:23.914 --> 00:29:25.313
But think about...

359
00:29:25.954 --> 00:29:30.123
how much we loved each other. All those times we spent together.

360
00:29:34.163 --> 00:29:37.394
You might forget about me,

361
00:29:37.764 --> 00:29:40.834
but please know that I'll love you forever.

362
00:29:52.044 --> 00:29:53.373
I got divorced.

363
00:29:55.144 --> 00:29:57.144
How?

364
00:29:57.144 --> 00:30:00.623
He was angry at me.

365
00:30:01.653 --> 00:30:04.623
But don't worry. We'll get back together.

366
00:30:04.623 --> 00:30:06.424
Please do so.

367
00:30:08.294 --> 00:30:09.464
How's Do Na?

368
00:30:11.464 --> 00:30:15.364
Doesn't she want to meet me?

369
00:30:15.364 --> 00:30:17.033
She's a strong child.

370
00:30:17.533 --> 00:30:19.934
She won't accept anything.

371
00:30:22.304 --> 00:30:23.473
That's a relief.

372
00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:27.614
I was worried she'll suffer because of me.

373
00:30:31.584 --> 00:30:32.883
You miss her, right?

374
00:30:37.294 --> 00:30:40.153
Yes, a lot.

375
00:30:52.373 --> 00:30:53.434
Dong Woo.

376
00:30:54.144 --> 00:30:56.073
Don't waste your energy.

377
00:30:56.073 --> 00:30:57.943
We haven't even started filming yet.

378
00:30:57.943 --> 00:31:00.614
- What's going on? - I always wait for you.

379
00:31:00.614 --> 00:31:02.943
Why do you keep wasting your time?

380
00:31:02.943 --> 00:31:05.153
- I'll give you a ride. - I have a car.

381
00:31:05.153 --> 00:31:07.584
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning too.

382
00:31:08.223 --> 00:31:09.554
Are you that bored?

383
00:31:10.253 --> 00:31:12.054
How long are you going to reject me for?

384
00:31:13.193 --> 00:31:14.823
- Ha Kyung. - Yes.

385
00:31:14.823 --> 00:31:16.464
I don't want to get married.

386
00:31:16.823 --> 00:31:18.334
Don't waste your efforts on me.

387
00:31:19.533 --> 00:31:23.133
You are so mean. I have to marry you.

388
00:31:25.804 --> 00:31:28.573
You must be tired. Let me give you a ride.

389
00:31:34.883 --> 00:31:36.344
Why are you by yourself?

390
00:31:37.253 --> 00:31:38.484
Who should I come home with?

391
00:31:38.484 --> 00:31:40.623
Ha Kyung said she'll drop you off.

392
00:31:40.623 --> 00:31:42.684
I told her to come in for some tea.

393
00:31:42.684 --> 00:31:44.753
Stop responding to her.

394
00:31:45.753 --> 00:31:49.294
You're so cold to her. I have to be nice so that she doesn't run away.

395
00:31:50.794 --> 00:31:51.893
I'll go inside.

396
00:32:17.294 --> 00:32:21.294
I raised you since you were 10.

397
00:32:22.063 --> 00:32:25.763
I was 25 years old, still so young, when I started raising you.

398
00:32:25.994 --> 00:32:28.003
It was tough, but I relied on you too.

399
00:32:28.664 --> 00:32:31.404
I lost my brother and his wife in an accident,

400
00:32:31.503 --> 00:32:33.434
and after I started raising you,

401
00:32:35.073 --> 00:32:38.344
but after I started raising you, I knew I couldn't.

402
00:32:38.443 --> 00:32:39.513
I don't regret it.

403
00:32:40.474 --> 00:32:42.844
I was less lonely with you around.

404
00:32:42.844 --> 00:32:44.883
I know you went through a lot.

405
00:32:44.883 --> 00:32:46.513
I'm not complimenting myself.

406
00:32:46.883 --> 00:32:49.854
At this age, I'm a bit lonely.

407
00:32:52.054 --> 00:32:53.224
I...

408
00:32:55.594 --> 00:32:57.763
don't want you to live like that.

409
00:33:15.044 --> 00:33:16.414
Why are you waiting outside?

410
00:33:18.453 --> 00:33:19.984
Come and sit down.

411
00:33:26.753 --> 00:33:29.123
- Do Na. - Yes?

412
00:33:29.123 --> 00:33:30.224
I know...

413
00:33:31.063 --> 00:33:34.463
that you want to be loyal to the mother that raised you.

414
00:33:34.633 --> 00:33:36.404
I understand.

415
00:33:38.133 --> 00:33:40.773
I'll tell you everything.

416
00:33:42.744 --> 00:33:46.844
Your father was planning to divorce your mother.

417
00:33:47.614 --> 00:33:49.914
He wanted to marry Lara.

418
00:33:51.383 --> 00:33:52.713
You should go to bed.

419
00:33:53.083 --> 00:33:55.284
Your mother and I...

420
00:33:55.284 --> 00:33:57.224
went to see Lara when she had you.

421
00:33:57.823 --> 00:33:59.693
When we got there,

422
00:33:59.693 --> 00:34:01.494
we begged her.

423
00:34:01.794 --> 00:34:04.034
We asked her to give you to us.

424
00:34:04.994 --> 00:34:07.664
- She was too kind... - Would someone so kind...

425
00:34:10.573 --> 00:34:12.273
have the child of a man that has a family?

426
00:34:12.273 --> 00:34:13.703
It was her first love...

427
00:34:13.703 --> 00:34:16.443
My mom said the same thing. She said Dad was her first love.

428
00:34:17.344 --> 00:34:18.914
He told her she's lucky...

429
00:34:18.914 --> 00:34:21.013
to marry her first love.

430
00:34:23.013 --> 00:34:24.854
That's what Mom was like.

431
00:34:26.513 --> 00:34:29.054
The person that made Mom cry...

432
00:34:30.453 --> 00:34:31.724
is that woman.

433
00:34:35.664 --> 00:34:36.763
You should sleep.

434
00:35:06.023 --> 00:35:08.094
- Bum Woo. - Yes?

435
00:35:09.063 --> 00:35:11.094
I say I'm helping you,

436
00:35:12.833 --> 00:35:14.934
but there's nothing I can do for you.

437
00:35:17.203 --> 00:35:18.773
You already did a lot.

438
00:35:20.234 --> 00:35:21.344
No.

439
00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:24.143
I just acted like I did.

440
00:35:28.184 --> 00:35:29.844
I already knew from the beginning.

441
00:35:31.883 --> 00:35:33.583
The one that has to break the shell...

442
00:35:34.424 --> 00:35:35.823
is yourself.

443
00:35:37.654 --> 00:35:40.253
I can't break it for you.

444
00:35:45.094 --> 00:35:47.664
If you're unable to break out of it,

445
00:35:50.363 --> 00:35:52.304
then there won't be any more chances for you.

446
00:35:56.644 --> 00:35:57.743
Copy me.

447
00:36:00.113 --> 00:36:02.243
No matter how you all look down on me,

448
00:36:02.813 --> 00:36:04.184
I'm Kim Bum Woo.

449
00:36:04.813 --> 00:36:06.813
No matter how you all look down on me,

450
00:36:07.483 --> 00:36:08.784
I'm Kim Bum Woo.

451
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:11.823
I won't budge. I'll keep going forward.

452
00:36:12.024 --> 00:36:14.524
I won't budge. I'll keep going forward.

453
00:36:15.024 --> 00:36:16.593
The path I'm taking...

454
00:36:17.493 --> 00:36:18.934
is the only way.

455
00:36:19.733 --> 00:36:22.804
The path I'm taking is the only way!

456
00:36:24.674 --> 00:36:27.103
Get out of my way, you cruel world!

457
00:37:05.313 --> 00:37:06.874
Do you know what you're good at?

458
00:37:08.284 --> 00:37:10.044
Do I have such a thing?

459
00:37:13.853 --> 00:37:15.684
It's that you don't ask anything.

460
00:37:18.223 --> 00:37:20.054
I'm not sure if that's a compliment.

461
00:37:23.764 --> 00:37:24.863
Thank you...

462
00:37:25.863 --> 00:37:28.563
for leaving me alone earlier.

463
00:38:07.004 --> 00:38:09.504
Is that you, Director?

464
00:38:11.374 --> 00:38:15.213
Gosh, look who it is. Is that you, Lara?

465
00:38:16.144 --> 00:38:18.684
It's been so long, sir.

466
00:38:19.284 --> 00:38:20.884
Just a moment.

467
00:38:26.493 --> 00:38:28.764
Has it been 30 years or so?

468
00:38:29.223 --> 00:38:30.634
- Yes. - How did time...

469
00:38:30.634 --> 00:38:32.294
slip past by you?

470
00:38:32.493 --> 00:38:33.764
You're exactly the same.

471
00:38:33.764 --> 00:38:35.333
You're still a joker.

472
00:38:35.504 --> 00:38:37.034
How are you doing?

473
00:38:39.073 --> 00:38:40.274
Don't you know?

474
00:38:41.144 --> 00:38:42.343
About what?

475
00:38:42.674 --> 00:38:44.874
I'm divorced.

476
00:38:45.144 --> 00:38:47.073
No way.

477
00:38:47.073 --> 00:38:48.743
Are you acting like you don't know,

478
00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:50.813
or did you really not know?

479
00:38:52.453 --> 00:38:55.254
I'm developing a new film,

480
00:38:55.384 --> 00:38:56.983
so I've been very busy.

481
00:38:57.493 --> 00:38:59.654
I don't really know what else is going on.

482
00:39:01.024 --> 00:39:03.264
You're going to shoot a new film?

483
00:39:03.264 --> 00:39:04.294
Yes.

484
00:39:14.004 --> 00:39:15.304
She took the bait.

485
00:39:16.304 --> 00:39:17.514
That easily?

486
00:39:17.514 --> 00:39:19.274
She used to be a queen.

487
00:39:19.813 --> 00:39:23.083
She wouldn't know how cruel the real world is.

488
00:39:27.054 --> 00:39:29.483
(Kim Min Woo, Jung Sung Ah)

489
00:39:41.563 --> 00:39:43.634
- Do Na. - Yes?

490
00:39:44.603 --> 00:39:47.343
What happened? You left this morning without a word.

491
00:39:47.843 --> 00:39:49.404
Your phone was off.

492
00:39:52.613 --> 00:39:53.644
It's here.

493
00:40:09.664 --> 00:40:11.093
Are you all right?

494
00:40:13.294 --> 00:40:15.904
- Why wouldn't I be? - Don't act in front of me.

495
00:40:16.063 --> 00:40:18.934
You can yell and cry if it hurts.

496
00:40:20.304 --> 00:40:21.544
I'm completely fine.

497
00:40:22.573 --> 00:40:24.473
That's even weirder.

498
00:40:25.044 --> 00:40:26.914
You should be hurting.

499
00:40:26.914 --> 00:40:28.813
I know you're just holding it in.

500
00:40:28.983 --> 00:40:30.684
That's true,

501
00:40:32.284 --> 00:40:34.223
but it's not because I'm hurt.

502
00:40:34.223 --> 00:40:35.284
Do Na.

503
00:40:36.284 --> 00:40:37.554
Let's be honest.

504
00:40:39.394 --> 00:40:40.863
What I'm holding in...

505
00:40:41.294 --> 00:40:43.424
is the feeling of being betrayed by my dad.

506
00:40:43.424 --> 00:40:45.363
It's worse than being in pain.

507
00:40:46.333 --> 00:40:48.534
It embarrasses me that I'm an illegitimate child.

508
00:40:48.534 --> 00:40:50.264
I can't feel anything else.

509
00:41:11.993 --> 00:41:13.024
Do Na.

510
00:41:18.963 --> 00:41:20.193
I missed you.

511
00:41:25.103 --> 00:41:26.174
Who are you?

512
00:41:27.774 --> 00:41:28.843
Do Na.

513
00:41:35.943 --> 00:41:38.083
You must be confused.

514
00:41:41.823 --> 00:41:43.323
Let's go somewhere else to talk.

515
00:42:01.973 --> 00:42:03.843
Why did you miss me?

516
00:42:05.813 --> 00:42:07.144
I'm sorry, Do Na.

517
00:42:08.113 --> 00:42:09.184
For what?

518
00:42:10.483 --> 00:42:12.113
What are you sorry for?

519
00:42:12.353 --> 00:42:14.054
I wanted to raise you, but...

520
00:42:14.054 --> 00:42:15.424
Who are you...

521
00:42:16.654 --> 00:42:18.593
to say that?

522
00:42:20.054 --> 00:42:22.723
- Do Na. - If you kept it a secret until now,

523
00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:25.034
you should have taken it to your grave.

524
00:42:28.703 --> 00:42:29.934
I'm so sorry.

525
00:42:30.874 --> 00:42:33.573
You must think I'm your daughter,

526
00:42:35.243 --> 00:42:37.044
but I don't have a mother like you.

527
00:42:47.384 --> 00:42:49.054
Does it make you happy...

528
00:42:50.993 --> 00:42:53.254
to tell the world I'm an illegitimate child?

529
00:42:55.093 --> 00:42:58.193
I really don't know how that happened.

530
00:42:58.193 --> 00:42:59.733
I only have one mother,

531
00:43:01.934 --> 00:43:03.934
so don't you ever come see me again.

532
00:43:39.733 --> 00:43:43.004
Honey, can you come home earlier tonight?

533
00:43:43.343 --> 00:43:46.174
I got new pajamas, and they're really cute.

534
00:44:45.834 --> 00:44:47.374
("Thyme")

535
00:44:50.203 --> 00:44:51.243
Dad.

536
00:44:52.943 --> 00:44:57.513
To this day, I was proud to be your daughter.

537
00:44:59.854 --> 00:45:01.523
But not anymore.

538
00:45:02.684 --> 00:45:03.824
I...

539
00:45:04.993 --> 00:45:06.654
am abandoning you.

540
00:45:23.104 --> 00:45:24.874
Sure. No, we're thankful.

541
00:45:27.314 --> 00:45:28.644
Hello, Director Shin.

542
00:45:30.684 --> 00:45:32.483
You must know who Lara is.

543
00:45:33.414 --> 00:45:37.354
I heard you had her notebook pad when you were in middle school.

544
00:45:38.894 --> 00:45:41.293
Hello, nice to meet you.

545
00:45:42.223 --> 00:45:44.733
- Sure. - Have a seat. Take a seat.

546
00:45:45.634 --> 00:45:46.793
Take a seat.

547
00:45:53.803 --> 00:45:58.243
Lara wants to make a comeback in 25 years.

548
00:45:58.743 --> 00:46:01.743
What do you think about her playing Ms. Kang in "Acanthus"?

549
00:46:01.743 --> 00:46:04.453
We already decided to go with Ms. Shin Hwa Im.

550
00:46:05.354 --> 00:46:06.354
Shin Hwa Im?

551
00:46:07.753 --> 00:46:08.884
Yes.

552
00:46:09.154 --> 00:46:12.523
Then can't she play Seol Do Hyun's mom?

553
00:46:13.354 --> 00:46:15.223
My drama's production assistant is Ha Do Na.

554
00:46:15.924 --> 00:46:19.993
- I know. - That's why she wants to be on it.

555
00:46:19.993 --> 00:46:22.104
She wants to work with Do Na.

556
00:46:22.104 --> 00:46:25.074
Don't you think you're being cruel?

557
00:46:26.074 --> 00:46:27.844
- I do. - And still?

558
00:46:27.844 --> 00:46:29.104
I want to...

559
00:46:30.943 --> 00:46:33.013
get at least one more look at her.

560
00:46:34.144 --> 00:46:35.844
Is that too selfish of me?

561
00:46:36.243 --> 00:46:37.253
Yes.

562
00:46:37.553 --> 00:46:39.283
Then can you help...

563
00:46:39.713 --> 00:46:41.624
this selfish mother out?

564
00:46:56.634 --> 00:47:00.074
From where I'm standing, I must protect her as much as I can.

565
00:47:00.334 --> 00:47:04.174
That's why I cannot let you be on my drama.

566
00:47:08.884 --> 00:47:11.614
It looks like my baby has a great senior at work.

567
00:47:26.334 --> 00:47:29.203
Can you think it over?

568
00:48:03.164 --> 00:48:05.904
This is like a lucky charm for you.

569
00:48:07.203 --> 00:48:11.074
When you have this tie on, you'll become Jin Hee.

570
00:48:15.184 --> 00:48:18.184
Thank you very much.

571
00:48:23.684 --> 00:48:25.924
If you can't do it, you can hang yourself to death.

572
00:48:27.023 --> 00:48:28.023
Okay.

573
00:48:28.263 --> 00:48:30.894
- Keep it up, okay? - Yes.

574
00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:35.703
Let me see.

575
00:48:48.384 --> 00:48:49.414
You look great.

576
00:48:50.283 --> 00:48:52.283
Don't you think the one I tried on last week was better?

577
00:48:52.283 --> 00:48:53.854
You looked great in that too.

578
00:48:54.154 --> 00:48:55.384
You look great in anything.

579
00:48:56.384 --> 00:48:58.094
I'll try on another one.

580
00:49:10.463 --> 00:49:11.703
Do you have be somewhere?

581
00:49:15.243 --> 00:49:17.104
It's almost time for my meeting.

582
00:49:17.374 --> 00:49:20.644
Then you should get going. I'll take pictures and send it.

583
00:49:20.644 --> 00:49:23.043
Okay. I'm sorry.

584
00:49:23.483 --> 00:49:26.314
Make sure you send me every single one you try on.

585
00:49:26.614 --> 00:49:27.753
I will.

586
00:49:45.074 --> 00:49:48.644
Do you surf the Internet often?

587
00:49:49.303 --> 00:49:50.874
Not really.

588
00:49:52.443 --> 00:49:53.513
I see.

589
00:49:54.414 --> 00:49:55.943
Is there something I should look for?

590
00:49:57.013 --> 00:49:58.253
No, nothing.

591
00:50:08.723 --> 00:50:09.763
Yes?

592
00:50:10.164 --> 00:50:12.064
What? Right now?

593
00:50:14.703 --> 00:50:17.104
Okay, I'll be there right now.

594
00:50:19.374 --> 00:50:22.273
Hey, you'll have to eat alone. Something urgent came up.

595
00:50:22.273 --> 00:50:23.473
I'll call you.

596
00:50:25.043 --> 00:50:26.243
Be careful.

597
00:50:26.674 --> 00:50:27.783
I'm sorry.

598
00:50:50.533 --> 00:50:53.773
Episode three has even less lines than the last.

599
00:50:54.404 --> 00:50:57.243
No, it's not even less. It's non existent.

600
00:50:58.243 --> 00:51:01.513
Then should a legendary boss be very talkative?

601
00:51:01.814 --> 00:51:05.283
I'm not asking you to shape him into a talkative character.

602
00:51:06.283 --> 00:51:08.184
Don't you get what I'm saying?

603
00:51:08.184 --> 00:51:09.753
I don't. I don't get it.

604
00:51:10.324 --> 00:51:13.394
Why don't you get such a simple concept?

605
00:51:13.864 --> 00:51:16.594
Is it so hard to understand how I have not enough lines?

606
00:51:16.963 --> 00:51:19.434
Min Hyeok just met Su Jeong again,

607
00:51:19.434 --> 00:51:21.404
and an internal conflict breaks out.

608
00:51:21.404 --> 00:51:23.503
What more can they say?

609
00:51:23.503 --> 00:51:27.904
I'm just frustrated to only see ellipses on the script.

610
00:51:27.904 --> 00:51:30.943
Forget that. You're making me dizzy. Can you sit and talk?

611
00:51:33.243 --> 00:51:35.483
Those ellipses are exactly the moments...

612
00:51:35.483 --> 00:51:38.253
when you need to show how you feel inside.

613
00:51:38.553 --> 00:51:40.783
It's not that I can't do that.

614
00:51:40.783 --> 00:51:44.293
I'm worried that my character has absolutely nothing to say, and...

615
00:51:44.953 --> 00:51:49.424
Stop worrying so much, and please focus on studying your character.

616
00:51:50.793 --> 00:51:51.834
Goodbye, then.

617
00:51:53.134 --> 00:51:55.263
- Darn it. - Are you leaving like this again?

618
00:51:57.404 --> 00:52:00.904
I told you she won't budge. Why did you call her?

619
00:52:00.904 --> 00:52:03.443
I've never seen anyone who ignores him like that.

620
00:52:03.443 --> 00:52:05.814
I think we need to come up with a plan.

621
00:52:05.814 --> 00:52:08.283
She's not someone you can talk to for a long time.

622
00:52:09.713 --> 00:52:10.854
You know what?

623
00:52:11.854 --> 00:52:13.684
When she told you to sit, you did.

624
00:52:15.783 --> 00:52:18.894
- I did? - Yes.

Tell Mr. Bang to come.

627
00:52:39.973 --> 00:52:42.684
Chairman Kim, you must rest.

628
00:52:43.013 --> 00:52:44.854
You've been overworking yourself.

629
00:52:46.354 --> 00:52:49.223
I'll continue working as scheduled.

630
00:52:50.624 --> 00:52:53.023
Make sure I don't have 10 minutes of time to spare tomorrow.

631

Sir...

632
00:52:59.263 --> 00:53:02.164
Ms. Kang has been calling you continuously.

633
00:53:02.164 --> 00:53:04.473
Tell her that I need some time to think.

634
00:53:06.033 --> 00:53:07.074
Yes, sir.
