00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:02.831
- Is this for the laundry?
- Oh no.

6
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:04.509
I can do it.

7
00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.969
Wait, leave that there.

8
00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:08.135
Thank you.

9
00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.911
Leave that there,
and I'll take care of it.

10
00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:20.010
Mister Kim Jae Woong,
how are you feeling today?

11
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:25.620
It's perfect weather for a walk.

12
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.688
Ah, I heard that you are
Grandma Duk Boon's daughter-in-law.

13
00:01:30.688 --> 00:01:34.186
Yes, I hope we can work well together.

14
00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:35.695
I should be the one saying that.

15
00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:38.697
Grandma Duk Boon is much more
popular here than I am.

16
00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:40.376
Oh, I see.

17
00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:44.243
By the way, what's the matter
with that man?

18
00:01:44.243 --> 00:01:47.325
He has colon cancer,
but miraculously his colon drained.

19
00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:49.814
But he still has his cancer.

20
00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:54.568
He tried alternative treatment,
and he managed to pass gas.

21
00:01:54.568 --> 00:01:56.038
I nearly cried.

22
00:01:56.038 --> 00:01:58.854
It's nothing for a normal person.

23
00:01:58.854 --> 00:02:01.079
For the patients here,
simple things are miracles.

24
00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:05.319
I think that patient
desperately wants something.

25
00:02:06.453 --> 00:02:08.104
I believe his will to live is strong.

26
00:02:08.772 --> 00:02:10.305
What made you ask about him?

27
00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:12.405
Did Mister Kim Jae Woong say something?

28
00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:13.955
No...

29
00:02:15.306 --> 00:02:16.424
It's nothing.

30
00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:19.382
Let's just work well together
going forward.

31
00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:21.805
Isn't this too heavy for you?

32
00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:22.945
It must be very hard.

33
00:02:22.945 --> 00:02:25.185
No, I'm fine. I can do it.

34
00:02:25.824 --> 00:02:27.634
Make sure to eat while you're at work.

35
00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:40.415
Park Ga Ram, you like
these kind of things, don't you?

36
00:02:42.026 --> 00:02:43.067
Want to buy it?

37
00:02:44.818 --> 00:02:46.270
You must be out of allowance money.

38
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.741
Hey, what do you take me for?

39
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.664
I was caught at the internet cafe.

40
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:53.540
Wow. That's U2.

41
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.800
That's their first album from the '80s.

42
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.131
That's really rare.

43
00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:00.471
I do want it.

44
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:02.088
Where did you get it?

45
00:03:02.088 --> 00:03:04.657
It's from my... I mean my dad's room.

46
00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:06.617
No, it's from my room.

47
00:03:06.617 --> 00:03:09.008
Why are you secretly selling it?

48
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:10.627
The reason is...

49
00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:16.317
- I can't get caught by that person.
- "That person"?

50
00:03:16.317 --> 00:03:18.205
Yes, that person.

51
00:03:18.205 --> 00:03:20.686
Lee Shi Young, darn it.

52
00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:22.236
What about Shi Young?

53
00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:25.926
Hey, would she let it go
if she knew if I was selling this?

54
00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:30.319
I'll buy it. How much do you need?

55
00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.765
As much as I can get.

56
00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:34.687
How long can you last
selling things like this?

57
00:03:34.687 --> 00:03:36.777
Do you need money that badly?

58
00:03:37.687 --> 00:03:39.376
Yes, very badly.

59
00:03:47.788 --> 00:03:49.307
Oh, that's nonsense.

60
00:03:49.307 --> 00:03:51.411
Bernard forced Ga Ram to give him money?

61
00:03:51.411 --> 00:03:52.868
I doubt that.

62
00:03:52.868 --> 00:03:54.290
You know my dad's a cop, right?

63
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.879
My dad told me this.

64
00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.169
These gangster types from Seoul
came here to catch Shi Kyung.

65
00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.526
Wow, really?

66
00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:01.670
That's crazy.

67
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.682
He must be on the run from gangsters.

68
00:04:03.682 --> 00:04:05.665
What could he have done
to make them come after him?

69
00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:08.677
But, Shi Kyung doesn't seem
that way at all when he's with us.

70
00:04:08.677 --> 00:04:10.024
If anything, he seems a little slow.

71
00:04:10.024 --> 00:04:11.339
You're right.

72
00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.509
- He's Bernard, after all... Bernard.
- No.

73
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.163
- It all makes sense now.
- What is it?

74
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.355
I happened to overhear
Shi Kyung on the phone.

75
00:04:23.877 --> 00:04:26.255
Hey, do you know what I've been through?

76
00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:32.153
They nailed me inside a coffin
to keep me from testifying.

77
00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:34.865
Yes!

78
00:04:37.048 --> 00:04:38.125
What does that mean?

79
00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.817
I just told you, dummy.

80
00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:43.944
I'm going to summarize it,
so listen carefully.

81
00:04:43.944 --> 00:04:46.665
A school assault case
was opened because of Shi Kyung.

82
00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:51.317
He trapped the person who witnessed
the assault inside a coffin.

83
00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:53.524
The end.

84
00:04:56.517 --> 00:04:58.569
Bom, what brings you here?

85
00:04:58.569 --> 00:04:59.976
You were in class at this hour?

86
00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:01.653
That's why I'm leaving now.

87
00:05:03.978 --> 00:05:05.786
Does anyone know Lee Shi Kyung's number?

88
00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:07.793
I know it. Why?

89
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:21.988
Amazing.

90
00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.252
What is this? So amazing.

91
00:05:24.252 --> 00:05:26.502
What's so funny there?

92
00:05:26.502 --> 00:05:28.333
Let me have a laugh too.

93
00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:33.196
These are poems written by the ladies
in the senior club I teach.

94
00:05:33.196 --> 00:05:34.803
They are great. Take a look.

95
00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:39.274
"F---"

96
00:05:39.274 --> 00:05:42.449
That's a curse word.
You should say "ding dong" instead.

97
00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.067
You're using "Ding Dong"
as the chorus, huh?

98
00:05:45.067 --> 00:05:46.884
This old lady has quite the potty mouth.

99
00:05:46.884 --> 00:05:50.536
Oh yeah, have you heard
the rumors about Lee Shi Kyung?

100
00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:51.685
What about Shi Kyung?

101
00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.504
There's a rumor that he was
a top gangster at his old school.

102
00:05:54.504 --> 00:05:55.788
Look into it.

103
00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.005
A gangster?

104
00:05:57.634 --> 00:06:01.694
His paperwork hasn't come in
from Seoul yet.

105
00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:05.293
We should resolve things
if that's not true, so look into it.

106
00:06:05.293 --> 00:06:06.374
"Ding dong."

107
00:06:06.374 --> 00:06:09.591
What? Okay. "Ding..."

108
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.377
Yeah, Ji Min.

109
00:06:19.377 --> 00:06:22.108
It's lunch time here too.

110
00:06:22.108 --> 00:06:24.259
I had breakfast, so I just took a nap.

111
00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:28.559
My grandma's snoring is like a
3.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.

112
00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:29.608
Yes.

113
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.319
What? Really?

114
00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.930
What's Lee Shi Kyung going to do then?

115
00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:38.670
It's not Shi Kyung's fault.

116
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.406
You think Shi Kyung would do that?

117
00:06:42.228 --> 00:06:45.127
All right, let's talk later then.

118
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:50.494
You're Lee Shi Kyung's
little sister, right?

119
00:06:50.494 --> 00:06:52.512
- No, I'm not.
- Really?

120
00:06:53.305 --> 00:06:54.476
Then, you wouldn't know.

121
00:06:54.476 --> 00:06:56.257
What do you want to know?

122
00:06:56.257 --> 00:06:59.536
Did Lee Shi Kyung transfer here
because he bullied someone?

123
00:07:00.377 --> 00:07:01.625
Who said that?

124
00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:04.725
- It's not true?
- Who said that nonsense!

125
00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:05.964
Never mind, if it's not true.

126
00:07:22.098 --> 00:07:24.637
<i>[Contract Teacher Employment]</i>

127
00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.237
I'm hurting everywhere.

128
00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:38.098
How was it? Is the work okay?

129
00:07:38.098 --> 00:07:39.988
No, I feel like I'm dying.

130
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.079
Don't tell the kids.

131
00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:45.528
Why? It's not like you're doing
something you shouldn't.

132
00:07:45.528 --> 00:07:48.225
Because... I still feel awkward.

133
00:07:48.225 --> 00:07:52.492
I heard from Shi Young that the school
kids visit the hospice all the time.

134
00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:53.841
You'll run into them right away.

135
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.904
I heard they usually
volunteer on Saturdays.

136
00:07:55.904 --> 00:07:58.230
- I'm not around then.
- Okay.

137
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.514
Grandma knows, right?

138
00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:01.901
She got me the job.

139
00:08:02.663 --> 00:08:04.934
Oh, she totally scares me so much.

140
00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:06.744
You really are amazing, Jung Won.

141
00:08:08.964 --> 00:08:10.132
Jung Soo.

142
00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:16.742
There's this patient,
and he keeps staring at me.

143
00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:19.480
Really, he keeps staring at me.

144
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.955
It's starting to get strange.

145
00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:22.875
What kind of patient is he?

146
00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:25.601
I found out that he has
late-stage colon cancer.

147
00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:28.520
He was the head of a famous gang.

148
00:08:29.177 --> 00:08:32.158
You know those people you see on
the news for getting into big fights.

149
00:08:32.158 --> 00:08:36.149
Why... why would
he stare at you, Jung Won?

150
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:38.703
You really need to be careful.

151
00:08:38.703 --> 00:08:41.994
From a certain, wrong angle,
you can actually look pretty.

152
00:08:41.994 --> 00:08:43.583
- "Wrong angle"?
- Yes.

153
00:08:47.942 --> 00:08:48.947
Oh yeah.

154
00:08:48.947 --> 00:08:52.788
Go to the school tomorrow and
meet Shi Kyung's homeroom teacher.

155
00:08:52.788 --> 00:08:55.229
He wanted to talk to me,
but I have to work.

156
00:08:55.229 --> 00:08:56.505
I said you would go instead.

157
00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:58.706
Talk to him? Why?

158
00:09:03.147 --> 00:09:05.986
Wow. Where did you get all of this?

159
00:09:05.986 --> 00:09:07.028
Shh.

160
00:09:07.908 --> 00:09:09.910
I have to count it before
Lee Shi Young gets back.

161
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.325
I stole it from her piggy bank.

162
00:09:12.325 --> 00:09:13.337
She doesn't know.

163
00:09:13.337 --> 00:09:15.890
You must really need money.

164
00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:20.227
Why are there so many 10 wons?

165
00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:22.288
Yong Gi wanted me to give this to you.

166
00:09:23.817 --> 00:09:24.907
Yong Gi?

167
00:09:25.979 --> 00:09:28.107
Ah... him?

168
00:09:28.107 --> 00:09:30.443
You still don't know who Yong Gi is?

169
00:09:30.443 --> 00:09:32.462
He's the top fighter at our school.

170
00:09:33.643 --> 00:09:34.687
And?

171
00:09:35.336 --> 00:09:36.653
Anyway, here it is.

172
00:09:44.445 --> 00:09:47.095
<i>[Come to the roof. Right now!]</i>

173
00:09:56.075 --> 00:09:59.345
Hey, hey. That transfer student
and Yong Gi are fighting on the roof!

174
00:09:59.345 --> 00:10:01.634
Really? I heard that kid was
the best fighter at his old school.

175
00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:03.364
- Really?
- Transfer student?

176
00:10:03.364 --> 00:10:05.216
It can't be Lee Shi Kyung, could it?

177
00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:15.557
So, Shi Kyung was not the perpetrator.
He was the witness to the assault?

178
00:10:15.557 --> 00:10:19.940
Yes, Shi Kyung isn't the type
of person to hurt anyone.

179
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.577
His little sister always beats him up.

180
00:10:22.577 --> 00:10:23.783
Little sister?

181
00:10:24.393 --> 00:10:25.855
Oh, Shi Young.

182
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.527
I'm sure he's just holding back.

183
00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:30.037
No, he's not.

184
00:10:30.037 --> 00:10:33.807
I wonder how a rumor like that started.

185
00:10:33.807 --> 00:10:36.360
Yes, I wonder.
I'm relieved to hear it's not true.

186
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.269
Regardless of this rumor...

187
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:42.836
I did want to consult with his guardians.

188
00:10:42.836 --> 00:10:46.865
It's our school policy to connect with
the guardians or the student's parents.

189
00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:48.864
I'm sorry. My sister is so busy.

190
00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:50.336
No, no. It's okay.

191
00:10:50.336 --> 00:10:53.105
There are others
whose parents can't show up.

192
00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:54.753
Ah, I see.

193
00:10:54.753 --> 00:10:59.219
Teacher, Yong Gi went up to roof
with the transfer student.

194
00:10:59.219 --> 00:11:01.288
- Again?
- Transfer student...

195
00:11:02.798 --> 00:11:04.155
Shi Kyung.

196
00:11:21.942 --> 00:11:23.669
Did you challenge me to a fight?

197
00:11:24.529 --> 00:11:26.328
What are you talking about?

198
00:11:26.328 --> 00:11:29.589
- I came because you asked to see me.
- Why are you changing your mind now?

199
00:11:30.437 --> 00:11:32.964
You said two suns
cannot exist in the sky.

200
00:11:32.964 --> 00:11:35.239
You challenged me to a fight
with that nonsense.

201
00:11:35.239 --> 00:11:36.869
Are you scared now that you've seen me?

202
00:11:36.869 --> 00:11:39.149
Then be clear about it
and get on your knees.

203
00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:41.610
<i>There is always one
of these guys wherever you go.</i>

204
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.277
<i>There's no point in wasting time.</i>

205
00:12:13.192 --> 00:12:14.250
Satisfied?

206
00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.879
I got on my knees, and now I'm going.

207
00:12:29.611 --> 00:12:32.408
Oh and I didn't send you that note.

208
00:12:32.408 --> 00:12:34.399
Hey, get back here.

209
00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:35.407
Eom Yong Gi.

210
00:12:35.407 --> 00:12:37.299
<i>More so than Yong Gi's bravado...</i>

211
00:12:43.044 --> 00:12:45.884
<i>I was more afraid of being caught
by the owner of these coins.</i>

212
00:12:49.278 --> 00:12:50.549
Bernard, what are you doing?

213
00:12:52.023 --> 00:12:54.182
My piggy was light, so I checked.

214
00:12:54.182 --> 00:12:57.001
Someone cut the stomach open
and covered it with tape.

215
00:12:57.967 --> 00:13:01.268
Really? Who would do something like that?

216
00:13:01.268 --> 00:13:03.383
I know how much was in there.

217
00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:05.023
I better not be missing even 10 won.

218
00:13:05.812 --> 00:13:07.643
16,370 won.

219
00:13:08.592 --> 00:13:10.432
It was so hard counting it all.

220
00:13:10.432 --> 00:13:11.532
Did you see Aunt Jung Soo?

221
00:13:12.383 --> 00:13:15.533
- Aunt Jung Soo?
- She came to school because of you.

222
00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:18.038
- There's a rumor you're a gangster.
- What!

223
00:13:18.038 --> 00:13:21.144
Then was that note a trick to test me?

224
00:13:21.144 --> 00:13:22.736
I wouldn't know.

225
00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:26.403
Oh, I saw a familiar person
in front of our school.

226
00:13:26.403 --> 00:13:29.095
- By chance was it...
- I know. It's Jae Hoon.

227
00:13:29.095 --> 00:13:32.014
Right? Jae Hoon from your class in Seoul.

228
00:13:32.014 --> 00:13:33.634
He's here because of the school assault.

229
00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:36.804
You knew and didn't go see him?

230
00:13:36.804 --> 00:13:38.166
I don't want to see him.

231
00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:40.352
- I talked to him on the phone.
- Hey.

232
00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:44.101
Still, he came all the way from Seoul.
Are you a celebrity or something?

233
00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:46.301
It has nothing to do with you.
Mind your own business.

234
00:13:47.717 --> 00:13:49.100
I told you not to come here.

235
00:13:50.658 --> 00:13:51.778
Sorry.

236
00:13:51.778 --> 00:13:55.486
I don't know what else to do
other than meet with you.

237
00:13:55.486 --> 00:13:56.833
Leave.

238
00:13:56.833 --> 00:13:59.312
I told you meeting me won't help you.

239
00:13:59.312 --> 00:14:00.573
Shi Kyung.

240
00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:02.712
I told you what happened to me.

241
00:14:02.712 --> 00:14:06.932
Would you want to be a witness
if you had been trapped in a coffin?

242
00:14:06.932 --> 00:14:08.441
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:09.592 --> 00:14:11.485
But, can't you help me?

244
00:14:11.485 --> 00:14:16.068
Their parents have gone to the police,
and they claim that I'm the perpetrator.

245
00:14:16.068 --> 00:14:17.570
How does that even make sense?

246
00:14:18.547 --> 00:14:21.644
All the kids at school know
they've been bullying you.

247
00:14:21.644 --> 00:14:23.562
No one's actually seen it.

248
00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:26.437
They went to school and spread
a rumor that I was the perpetrator.

249
00:14:26.437 --> 00:14:28.712
I'm too scared to go to school.

250
00:14:29.644 --> 00:14:31.114
I might transfer.

251
00:14:32.874 --> 00:14:36.172
Suppose I do give a statement,
do you think they'll apologize?

252
00:14:36.172 --> 00:14:40.111
Do you think they'll stop,
and say "I'm sorry"?

253
00:14:40.952 --> 00:14:43.003
At least, the truth would be out.

254
00:14:43.003 --> 00:14:47.043
It shows that my parents weren't lying
when they sued them!

255
00:14:47.043 --> 00:14:49.845
It won't end with me
being beaten up, looking like a fool.

256
00:14:51.014 --> 00:14:52.083
Just transfer.

257
00:14:53.614 --> 00:14:54.902
Go and live well.

258
00:14:54.902 --> 00:14:56.312
Shi Kyung.

259
00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:58.714
I really feel like I'm going to die.

260
00:14:59.234 --> 00:15:01.073
No one believes me.

261
00:15:02.046 --> 00:15:03.433
Please help me.

262
00:15:07.225 --> 00:15:10.663
I'm sorry, but I don't want
to be involved anymore.

263
00:15:18.198 --> 00:15:20.080
- Lee Shi Kyung.
- No, don't expect anything.

264
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.331
Let's get a part-time job.

265
00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:26.721
The pay is really good.

266
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.961
With your looks, I think you can pass.

267
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:33.812
Let's go.

268
00:15:36.443 --> 00:15:37.784
Oh my gosh.

269
00:15:37.784 --> 00:15:40.849
Seriously, that is so funny.

270
00:15:40.849 --> 00:15:42.967
I was going to die laughing
because of Shi Kyung.

271
00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:46.157
What kind of guy gets
on his knees so easily?

272
00:15:46.157 --> 00:15:48.366
He is just too easy.

273
00:15:50.177 --> 00:15:54.722
Still, I'm really relieved that you
and Gi Hoon were mistaken.

274
00:15:54.722 --> 00:15:56.445
- Right?
- Yes.

275
00:15:58.751 --> 00:16:00.595
It's a video of Shi Kyung.

276
00:16:31.268 --> 00:16:32.523
Excuse me.

277
00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:36.042
I have a favor to ask.

278
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:38.792
A favor?

279
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:43.289
Can you call her?

280
00:16:44.913 --> 00:16:46.114
"Call her"?

281
00:16:46.114 --> 00:16:48.241
Yes, call this number.

282
00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:50.944
Ask if it's Ban Min Ja.

283
00:16:50.944 --> 00:16:54.931
You just need to ask her
if her son's name is Kim Jae Woong.

284
00:17:03.739 --> 00:17:04.948
<i>Hello?</i>

285
00:17:06.028 --> 00:17:07.732
Yes, hello.

286
00:17:07.732 --> 00:17:10.866
Is this Ban Min Ja?

287
00:17:10.866 --> 00:17:12.185
<i>Yes. Who are you?</i>

288
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.076
Ah, yes.

289
00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:19.083
Is your son's name Kim Jae Woong?

290
00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:20.657
<i>Do you know my Jae Woong?</i>

291
00:17:20.657 --> 00:17:22.667
<i>How do you know him?</i>

292
00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.317
<i>Is my Jae Woong alive?</i>

293
00:17:25.317 --> 00:17:27.138
<i>Where is he?</i>

294
00:17:27.138 --> 00:17:29.971
<i>Please where is my Jae Woong?</i>

295
00:17:29.971 --> 00:17:31.143
<i>Hello?</i>

296
00:17:32.459 --> 00:17:33.941
- Yes.
- <i>Jae Woong?</i>

297
00:17:34.657 --> 00:17:37.505
<i>Jae Woong, where are you?</i>

298
00:17:37.505 --> 00:17:40.884
- Uh, well...
- <i>Jae Woong, are you there?</i>

299
00:17:40.884 --> 00:17:42.671
<i>Jae Woong.</i>

300
00:17:44.498 --> 00:17:47.201
Mom...

301
00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:50.356
Mister, Mister.

302
00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:52.288
Are you okay?

303
00:17:52.288 --> 00:17:55.179
Over here! Doctor.

304
00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:58.365
Chief Nurse! Please help me.

305
00:18:01.071 --> 00:18:03.157
- 10 milligrams of morphine and an IV.
- Yes.

306
00:18:05.134 --> 00:18:08.239
Ban Min Ja...

307
00:18:08.999 --> 00:18:10.820
My mom.

308
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:16.219
35 years ago...

309
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.140
I left home.

310
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.768
I haven't seen my mom since then.

311
00:18:25.827 --> 00:18:29.501
The way my mom looked back then...

312
00:18:34.522 --> 00:18:36.692
you look just like her.

313
00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:44.207
Sir, please calm down.

314
00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:47.167
We gave you a sedative,
so get some sleep.

315
00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:48.377
Leave him be.

316
00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:49.940
Let him say what he wants.

317
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.999
My mom...

318
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.145
I miss her.

319
00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:58.741
Mom.

320
00:19:00.847 --> 00:19:03.713
You can see her.
We can tell her to come here.

321
00:19:05.252 --> 00:19:06.945
I don't want her to see me...

322
00:19:08.074 --> 00:19:10.054
like this.

323
00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:13.522
Mom...

324
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.276
Mom.

325
00:19:20.277 --> 00:19:25.250
So, shrouding is washing and
preparing the corpse for burial.

326
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.353
What? That's what you want to do now?

327
00:19:28.353 --> 00:19:29.419
No.

328
00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:32.746
Yong Gi's grandpa,
the undertaker, does the washing.

329
00:19:32.746 --> 00:19:34.855
We can just help him.

330
00:19:34.855 --> 00:19:36.505
He'll hire high school students?

331
00:19:36.505 --> 00:19:38.151
I said you were an older friend of mine.

332
00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:41.226
Honestly, you don't look that young.

333
00:19:42.846 --> 00:19:44.628
But, the undertaker
probably knows my face.

334
00:19:44.628 --> 00:19:45.907
I thought about that.

335
00:19:45.907 --> 00:19:49.205
Yong Gi's grandpa never remembers
the faces of living people very well.

336
00:19:51.903 --> 00:19:55.152
I do need the money, but I don't know.

337
00:19:57.313 --> 00:20:00.501
Should I promise not to go to the
internet cafe and ask my mom for money?

338
00:20:01.691 --> 00:20:03.045
My grandma would be easier.

339
00:20:04.362 --> 00:20:05.460
Where are you going?

340
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.741
To my grandma. Sorry.

341
00:20:12.073 --> 00:20:15.321
You have to be professional
in this place.

342
00:20:15.321 --> 00:20:19.951
You cannot get involved with patients
because of your compassion.

343
00:20:20.621 --> 00:20:22.634
- He asked for a favor.
- Your job...

344
00:20:22.634 --> 00:20:25.872
is to handle the laundry
that the volunteers can't do.

345
00:20:25.872 --> 00:20:27.832
That is all you need to do well.

346
00:20:27.832 --> 00:20:29.602
Don't go overboard.

347
00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:46.541
I just wanted to hear your voice, Mom.

348
00:20:47.554 --> 00:20:49.961
The move? It went well.

349
00:20:50.892 --> 00:20:52.660
Grandma is being great to the kids.

350
00:20:54.803 --> 00:20:58.001
No, there's an art academy here,
so I'm teaching the kids here.

351
00:20:59.421 --> 00:21:01.861
Jung Soo's doing well too.
She'll get a job soon.

352
00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:04.942
Mom.

353
00:21:06.412 --> 00:21:07.691
Live a long time.

354
00:21:08.512 --> 00:21:11.931
Even if I can't visit you,
live well for a long time.

355
00:21:13.722 --> 00:21:15.211
Nothing's wrong.

356
00:21:15.211 --> 00:21:17.401
I just wanted to hear your voice, Mom.

357
00:21:19.384 --> 00:21:20.502
I better get going.

358
00:21:21.211 --> 00:21:22.752
It's time for me to teach my class.

359
00:21:22.752 --> 00:21:25.255
Okay. Yes, yes.

360
00:21:54.282 --> 00:21:55.354
It's me.

361
00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:00.501
Can I still do that shrouding thing?

362
00:22:01.531 --> 00:22:03.830
- Are you going to do it too?
- No.

363
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.931
I'm just going to observe.

364
00:22:06.794 --> 00:22:09.662
Once I go to medical school,
I'll have to see corpses.

365
00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:11.798
I thought it would be good
to see one now.

366
00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:14.340
- You're going to be a doctor?
- Yes.

367
00:22:15.863 --> 00:22:16.932
We're here.

368
00:22:16.932 --> 00:22:20.991
Stop talking now, and do only what I say.

369
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.885
- Okay.
- Okay.

370
00:22:39.862 --> 00:22:43.305
Let's have a moment of silence
before we start washing the body.

371
00:22:53.329 --> 00:22:56.652
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E03 Andante "It Bothers Me That Much"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

372
00:23:04.468 --> 00:23:05.525
What?

373
00:23:09.727 --> 00:23:10.846
<i>That's strange.</i>

374
00:23:10.846 --> 00:23:13.505
<i>I was so sure his toe moved.</i>

375
00:23:14.257 --> 00:23:15.976
<i>Am I hallucinating because I'm nervous?</i>

376
00:23:38.932 --> 00:23:42.013
Now, it's time to wash him clean.

377
00:23:42.532 --> 00:23:45.109
Bring me the chemicals
and towels from over there.

378
00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:50.384
Your hired helpers?

379
00:23:50.384 --> 00:23:52.083
Yes, Director.

380
00:23:52.763 --> 00:23:57.126
Please take good care of
Mister Kang Sung Hoon.

381
00:23:58.978 --> 00:24:01.759
Yong Gi's Grandpa,
can I speak to you for a moment?

382
00:24:08.349 --> 00:24:11.407
I saw it! His toe moved.

383
00:24:11.407 --> 00:24:14.002
Oh, that's because of cataleptic...

384
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.974
Lee Shi Kyung, wake up! Hey.

385
00:24:21.974 --> 00:24:23.230
Ga Ram.

386
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.478
Dad.

387
00:24:27.952 --> 00:24:30.769
It's called cataleptic rigidity
and spasms.

388
00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:34.440
It's a natural effect due to the proteins
in the muscles of the body.

389
00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:37.509
What will you do?
You didn't even get paid.

390
00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:39.009
My pay is not the issue.

391
00:24:39.009 --> 00:24:41.050
I nearly died in there.

392
00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.201
Yeah, it seems like you have died
and come back to life many times.

393
00:24:44.201 --> 00:24:47.611
Tell me about it.
Why is my life like this?

394
00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.226
Ah...

395
00:24:50.701 --> 00:24:53.281
Do you want to know about a person
who really came back to life?

396
00:24:54.143 --> 00:24:55.290
Who is that?

397
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.184
There was a woman
who really wanted to die.

398
00:24:58.184 --> 00:25:01.298
So, she decided to visit a place
she hadn't been to before dying.

399
00:25:01.298 --> 00:25:02.993
She went to the Grand Canyon.

400
00:25:02.993 --> 00:25:06.727
She expected to see
incredible nature and the space.

401
00:25:06.727 --> 00:25:08.943
She thought she would see it
and be moved by it.

402
00:25:08.943 --> 00:25:11.594
However, she got there and felt nothing.

403
00:25:11.594 --> 00:25:14.153
So, she decided that
it would be better to really die.

404
00:25:14.153 --> 00:25:19.682
Among that great landscape,
there was a tiny cactus.

405
00:25:19.682 --> 00:25:24.632
The moment she saw that little cactus
in that barren land...

406
00:25:24.632 --> 00:25:26.076
Did she then want to live?

407
00:25:26.076 --> 00:25:28.820
- Who is that story about?
- Just a person.

408
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.756
Why are you telling me that story?

409
00:25:32.315 --> 00:25:35.053
That friend of yours from earlier,
your witness testimony would...

410
00:25:35.053 --> 00:25:36.510
I knew you would bring that up.

411
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.942
What about my witness testimony?
What of it?

412
00:25:39.997 --> 00:25:44.193
Your witness testimony could be
like the tiny cactus to him.

413
00:25:44.193 --> 00:25:47.170
Are you expecting me to be moved
by that and go testify?

414
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.233
- Yes.
- Does that make sense?

415
00:25:49.233 --> 00:25:51.804
It makes more sense to see the
Grand Canyon and say "wow."

416
00:25:51.804 --> 00:25:55.307
How is a cactus you can find
in any flower shop comparable?

417
00:25:56.353 --> 00:25:58.013
I wish I could go to the Grand Canyon.

418
00:25:58.013 --> 00:25:59.375
You're missing the point.

419
00:25:59.375 --> 00:26:00.884
Is this about the vice-principal?

420
00:26:00.884 --> 00:26:03.724
She looks like the type
to tell this kind of story.

421
00:26:03.724 --> 00:26:05.805
"I'm not going to tell you."

422
00:26:05.805 --> 00:26:07.403
I knew it right then.

423
00:26:07.403 --> 00:26:11.307
<i>I heard everything. I heard everything.</i>

424
00:26:13.449 --> 00:26:17.673
Lee Shi Kyung, get one of those cacti
that you can find in any flower shop.

425
00:26:17.673 --> 00:26:20.063
Then come to the office on Monday.

426
00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:24.671
Have you ever seen such a "ding dong"?

427
00:26:28.117 --> 00:26:29.304
What is she saying?

428
00:26:29.304 --> 00:26:33.252
You can give your witness statement,
and then go to the office tomorrow.

429
00:26:33.252 --> 00:26:36.854
Whatever! I don't know. I don't know.

430
00:26:36.854 --> 00:26:40.147
Don't expect too much
from me. It's such a pain.

431
00:26:55.631 --> 00:26:57.907
<i>Shi Kyung, it's tomorrow.</i>

432
00:26:57.907 --> 00:27:00.287
<i>I know it's hard for you,
but please do it for me.</i>

433
00:27:02.097 --> 00:27:04.164
Gosh, I don't know!
What am I supposed to do?

434
00:27:05.257 --> 00:27:06.891
<i>It's bothering me.</i>

435
00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:10.821
<i>Just like Ga Ram said, it's on my mind.</i>

436
00:27:10.821 --> 00:27:12.863
<i>Are you asleep, Shi Kyung?</i>

437
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.191
Are you asleep already?

438
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.118
No.

439
00:27:23.155 --> 00:27:26.009
Is the heat working okay?

440
00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:28.211
Yes, it's warm.

441
00:27:30.922 --> 00:27:33.309
I heard about everything
from your mom earlier.

442
00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:36.327
Don't give a witness statement.

443
00:27:36.327 --> 00:27:41.317
They say you shouldn't hang around
police stations or courts.

444
00:27:41.317 --> 00:27:44.817
Okay, I wasn't going to.

445
00:27:44.817 --> 00:27:46.743
I already told my friend that.

446
00:27:48.023 --> 00:27:49.320
Good.

447
00:27:50.298 --> 00:27:52.403
<i>You don't feel good, do you?</i>

448
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.446
<i>No, I don't.</i>

449
00:27:56.896 --> 00:27:57.961
You...

450
00:27:59.836 --> 00:28:02.965
are just like your father.

451
00:28:09.574 --> 00:28:10.636
Here.

452
00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:14.615
This is some allowance money.

453
00:28:19.038 --> 00:28:20.215
Thank you.

454
00:28:24.352 --> 00:28:28.288
Your father lied to me a lot and
took allowance money from me too.

455
00:28:28.288 --> 00:28:31.028
One day, he said
he needed money from me.

456
00:28:31.028 --> 00:28:34.269
I wondered why he needed
so much money for school.

457
00:28:35.551 --> 00:28:37.328
Later, I found out.

458
00:28:38.689 --> 00:28:41.020
He had given it all away to his friends.

459
00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:45.189
He gave some to a friend who was
poor and couldn't afford lunch.

460
00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.948
One student who couldn't afford books.

461
00:28:50.579 --> 00:28:52.689
He gave it all away to others.

462
00:28:54.082 --> 00:28:55.410
In the end...

463
00:29:00.804 --> 00:29:02.018
Go to bed now.

464
00:29:09.461 --> 00:29:10.671
Goodnight.

465
00:29:21.912 --> 00:29:26.421
<i>In Grandma's memories,
my dad is the constant good son.</i>

466
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:31.660
<i>So, why can't I remember
a good dad in my memories?</i>

467
00:29:33.692 --> 00:29:35.249
<i>Is that why I'm like this?</i>

468
00:30:14.503 --> 00:30:15.817
<i>Please save me!</i>

469
00:30:17.406 --> 00:30:19.606
No!

470
00:31:04.153 --> 00:31:07.563
Are you crazy?
I thought you were a ghost.

471
00:31:08.461 --> 00:31:11.994
Hey, let's switch rooms.

472
00:31:11.994 --> 00:31:14.387
Then, I won't call you Bernard anymore.

473
00:31:14.387 --> 00:31:17.397
- Forget it.
- I'll call you "Older Brother."

474
00:31:18.631 --> 00:31:19.851
Shut up.

475
00:31:31.637 --> 00:31:35.516
Drink your water
and leave quietly, Bernard.

476
00:31:40.657 --> 00:31:41.746
Smell this.

477
00:31:41.746 --> 00:31:43.666
You're going to die.

478
00:31:55.019 --> 00:31:57.442
All the kids from our school
volunteer here.

479
00:31:57.442 --> 00:31:58.781
Oh, except for Bom.

480
00:31:58.781 --> 00:32:01.751
Bom? Kim Bom?

481
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:04.143
Why doesn't Kim Bom come here?

482
00:32:04.143 --> 00:32:06.813
Who knows? I don't know.

483
00:32:06.813 --> 00:32:08.080
You're not friendly with her?

484
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.258
She never gave me
a chance to be friendly.

485
00:32:10.258 --> 00:32:13.520
Bom transferred from Seoul just like you.

486
00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.681
I think it was during junior high.

487
00:32:15.681 --> 00:32:19.544
Anyway, she didn't talk
to anyone after she transferred.

488
00:32:19.544 --> 00:32:21.284
She had no interest in school events.

489
00:32:21.284 --> 00:32:24.363
We ended up becoming people
who only know each other's faces.

490
00:32:24.363 --> 00:32:27.142
Just as I thought, Kim Bom is a mystery.

491
00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:28.373
What do you mean?

492
00:32:28.373 --> 00:32:31.330
It's nothing. Let's go inside.

493
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.330
Ah, by the way, where's Shi Young?

494
00:32:46.491 --> 00:32:49.586
Why don't you go to the hospital
if your headaches are so severe?

495
00:32:49.586 --> 00:32:51.236
It gets better if I take the medicine.

496
00:32:53.969 --> 00:32:56.384
Where are you hurting, young lady?

497
00:32:56.384 --> 00:33:01.289
Do you have something that can
help me sleep during an earthquake?

498
00:33:03.705 --> 00:33:05.510
The sheets have probably been changed.

499
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:08.438
We need to clean the floors,
empty the locker, and the trash.

500
00:33:08.438 --> 00:33:09.900
Okay.

501
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.696
Oh!

502
00:33:13.114 --> 00:33:14.872
I think I've seen him before.

503
00:33:14.872 --> 00:33:16.710
Who is this?

504
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.316
Who? Do you know him?

505
00:33:23.412 --> 00:33:25.836
Yeah, I think I know him too.

506
00:33:26.859 --> 00:33:28.707
Did we see him while volunteering?

507
00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.320
You two are cleaning this room?

508
00:33:33.317 --> 00:33:36.193
Do a good job today.

509
00:33:36.193 --> 00:33:39.411
Dad, someone left a picture here.

510
00:33:39.411 --> 00:33:40.480
Let me see.

511
00:33:42.573 --> 00:33:44.002
You two don't recognize him?

512
00:33:44.002 --> 00:33:46.940
This is the same person you saw
down in the morgue.

513
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.257
That's him?

514
00:33:49.257 --> 00:33:51.500
Yes, that's him.

515
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.253
<i>Do the dead and the living
look that different?</i>

516
00:33:59.253 --> 00:34:02.311
This person died after a lot of
physical and emotional suffering.

517
00:34:02.311 --> 00:34:04.909
His son committed suicide
after being assaulted at school.

518
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:07.961
He quit his job
to focus on the lawsuit.

519
00:34:07.961 --> 00:34:10.902
He was running around here
and there and became ill.

520
00:34:31.641 --> 00:34:33.454
<i>His son died that way.</i>

521
00:34:34.273 --> 00:34:38.101
<i>The perpetrators weren't even punished
and just went back to attending school.</i>

522
00:34:38.101 --> 00:34:41.753
<i>Imagine how a father
would feel seeing that.</i>

523
00:34:49.286 --> 00:34:52.411
<i>Shi Kyung, no one believes me.</i>

524
00:34:52.411 --> 00:34:54.619
I really feel like I'm going to die.

525
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.340
Please help me.

526
00:35:43.367 --> 00:35:45.525
Gosh, I just don't know.

527
00:35:49.255 --> 00:35:50.396
What now?

528
00:35:51.646 --> 00:35:54.648
I was nervous and now
I have to go to the bathroom.

529
00:35:55.755 --> 00:35:56.827
Go on.

530
00:36:02.623 --> 00:36:04.539
Tell me in detail how
and where they hit him.

531
00:36:05.277 --> 00:36:07.050
It was mostly in the chest
and stomach area.

532
00:36:07.954 --> 00:36:09.351
They hit him with their fists.

533
00:36:09.351 --> 00:36:11.161
They kicked him too.

534
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:14.740
Was that the only time
you witnessed Jae Hoon being hit?

535
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:19.409
Yes, but I had heard that
they picked on Jae Hoon many times.

536
00:36:19.409 --> 00:36:21.643
That was the first time I saw it myself.

537
00:36:21.643 --> 00:36:25.630
If you were there too,
they must have seen you.

538
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.849
Were you hurt or wounded anywhere?

539
00:36:28.849 --> 00:36:31.409
They caught me while I was
running away, and they hit me once.

540
00:36:31.409 --> 00:36:33.228
I'm fine.

541
00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:37.431
Wow, those guys sound pretty terrible.

542
00:36:37.431 --> 00:36:39.730
You've been very brave.

543
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:44.427
I heard they followed you to your new
town and nailed you inside of a coffin.

544
00:36:44.427 --> 00:36:45.568
How do you know about that?

545
00:36:45.568 --> 00:36:48.409
Just a moment ago,
another student left this with me.

546
00:36:49.514 --> 00:36:50.929
Here. Take a look.

547
00:36:58.862 --> 00:37:00.590
About your friend, Shi Kyung...

548
00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.784
is he doing okay?

549
00:37:03.902 --> 00:37:04.945
Why?

550
00:37:04.945 --> 00:37:08.938
A while back, he was trapped
in a coffin and nearly buried alive.

551
00:37:08.938 --> 00:37:12.617
He claimed it was because
he had nowhere else to sleep.

552
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.668
I don't know. I think
there was something else going on.

553
00:37:16.668 --> 00:37:21.927
Dad, can I see the CCTV footage
of the storage room from that day?

554
00:37:21.927 --> 00:37:24.922
If it hasn't been deleted, then sure.

555
00:37:24.922 --> 00:37:25.965
Why do you need it?

556
00:37:25.965 --> 00:37:28.195
I think I have a good place to use it.

557
00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:33.619
<i>My life is all screwed up
because of that guy, Park Ga Ram.</i>

558
00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:40.338
<i>Shi Kyung, thank you
for your witness statement!</i>

559
00:37:40.338 --> 00:37:41.518
<i>I won't forget it.</i>

560
00:37:43.188 --> 00:37:45.351
<i>I really might end up
becoming a cactus, at this rate.</i>

561
00:37:45.351 --> 00:37:46.608
Did you do well?

562
00:37:48.028 --> 00:37:50.807
I just told them what I saw.
Do you want to get some food?

563
00:37:52.068 --> 00:37:54.146
Oh, you must be getting an allowance now.

564
00:37:54.146 --> 00:37:55.724
Can I have something expensive?

565
00:37:55.724 --> 00:37:58.244
Are you crazy? It's from my grandma.

566
00:37:58.244 --> 00:38:00.382
I don't have much left
after spending it on the bus.

567
00:38:00.382 --> 00:38:01.891
It has to be under 5,000 won.

568
00:38:03.811 --> 00:38:05.860
What's under 5,000 won these days?

569
00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.621
Black bean noodles?
Spicy seafood noodles?

570
00:38:08.195 --> 00:38:09.239
Fried dumplings.

571
00:38:44.208 --> 00:38:45.755
Oh, how embarrassing.

572
00:38:51.153 --> 00:38:52.838
I'm running late too.

573
00:38:55.802 --> 00:38:58.492
<i>That must hurt. You missed the bus, huh?</i>

574
00:38:58.492 --> 00:39:00.068
Who is this?

575
00:39:00.068 --> 00:39:01.909
I don't know this number.

576
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.072
<i>Look at you, looking around.</i>

577
00:39:08.072 --> 00:39:09.141
What is this?

578
00:39:16.072 --> 00:39:17.157
Where's your house?

579
00:39:17.157 --> 00:39:19.530
It's over that way.

580
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:21.320
- Why?
- Get on.

581
00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.621
I'll drive you.

582
00:39:22.621 --> 00:39:24.554
Who are you?

583
00:39:32.297 --> 00:39:33.400
Kim Bom?

584
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.005
Did you finish my tombstone inscription?

585
00:39:37.943 --> 00:39:39.005
Aren't you getting on?

586
00:39:41.222 --> 00:39:43.795
- Never mind then.
- No, I'll get on.

587
00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.251
<i>Kim Bom.</i>

588
00:40:20.192 --> 00:40:21.980
<i>How many faces does she have?</i>

589
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.152
<i>No, which is the real one?</i>

590
00:40:26.389 --> 00:40:28.155
<i>The Kim Bom who pretends to be a corpse?</i>

591
00:40:28.155 --> 00:40:30.802
<i>The Kim Bom who's cranky
and sleeps in class?</i>

592
00:40:30.802 --> 00:40:35.094
<i>Or... the sexy Kim Bom right now?</i>

593
00:40:39.985 --> 00:40:41.474
What is all of this?

594
00:40:41.474 --> 00:40:45.271
Grandma, why is my stuff out here?

595
00:40:46.942 --> 00:40:49.534
I can't stand messiness.

596
00:40:49.534 --> 00:40:51.931
Clean up what you want,
and throw out the rest.

597
00:40:52.702 --> 00:40:55.733
I had it organized the way I like it.

598
00:40:55.733 --> 00:41:00.693
I have my own rules and habits
that I've lived with for 17 years.

599
00:41:00.693 --> 00:41:03.844
Don't tell me to live
according to the way you like.

600
00:41:03.844 --> 00:41:07.391
You're living off of me.
What are you going on about?

601
00:41:07.391 --> 00:41:08.963
What the heck.

602
00:41:10.753 --> 00:41:11.755
"What the heck"?

603
00:41:11.755 --> 00:41:14.693
Do you think I'm living here
because I want to?

604
00:41:14.693 --> 00:41:17.364
I'm having a hard time because of you.

605
00:41:17.364 --> 00:41:19.373
Why would it be hard for you?

606
00:41:20.193 --> 00:41:23.786
You have no idea how loudly
you snore, do you Grandma?

607
00:41:23.786 --> 00:41:27.143
It's so loud that the house might
fall apart, and I can't sleep at all.

608
00:41:27.143 --> 00:41:29.387
Can't you see these dark circles?

609
00:41:30.184 --> 00:41:33.344
Look what you've done to my pretty face.
I have endure all of that.

610
00:41:33.344 --> 00:41:35.903
Why can't you overlook
something like this?

611
00:41:35.903 --> 00:41:38.614
I don't snore.
What are you talking about?

612
00:41:58.059 --> 00:42:00.478
You didn't come all the way
out here because of me, right?

613
00:42:00.478 --> 00:42:02.518
I did. Can't I do that?

614
00:42:02.518 --> 00:42:05.407
I come here often when I can't sleep.

615
00:42:05.407 --> 00:42:06.956
That's a relief then.

616
00:42:06.956 --> 00:42:09.309
How did you know my number?

617
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:10.788
The class president told me.

618
00:42:10.788 --> 00:42:11.878
Why would she do that?

619
00:42:11.878 --> 00:42:13.514
Because I asked her.

620
00:42:13.514 --> 00:42:16.675
<i>Oh, is she interested in me?</i>

621
00:42:16.675 --> 00:42:17.994
You want to know why I asked?

622
00:42:17.994 --> 00:42:21.157
- Yes.
- My tombstone inscription.

623
00:42:21.157 --> 00:42:22.596
I wanted to get it from you.

624
00:42:24.097 --> 00:42:27.126
Haven't you finished it yet?

625
00:42:27.126 --> 00:42:29.929
You must not know
since you don't come to school often.

626
00:42:29.929 --> 00:42:30.967
The thing is...

627
00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:34.648
I was caught cheating on my own
tombstone inscription.

628
00:42:34.648 --> 00:42:37.128
I know, Bernard.

629
00:42:38.465 --> 00:42:40.798
- Who doesn't know about Bernard?
- Fine, then.

630
00:42:41.568 --> 00:42:45.177
I'll take responsibility for yours
and do it for sure.

631
00:42:45.177 --> 00:42:47.842
Okay, make sure to do it.

632
00:42:47.842 --> 00:42:49.463
<i>Is that you, Shi Kyung?</i>

633
00:42:49.463 --> 00:42:51.237
Yes, Mom!

634
00:42:52.257 --> 00:42:54.215
I better get going. Bye.

635
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:00.429
Bye.

636
00:43:07.028 --> 00:43:08.829
<i>Why are you so late?</i>

637
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:10.331
<i>I was out with Ga Ram.</i>

638
00:43:10.331 --> 00:43:12.639
<i>Yeah right. You went
to the internet cafe, didn't you?</i>

639
00:43:12.639 --> 00:43:13.668
<i>Be quiet.</i>

640
00:43:13.668 --> 00:43:15.409
<i>Is that you, Shi Kyung?</i>

641
00:43:15.409 --> 00:43:17.101
<i>Yes, Grandma!</i>

642
00:43:17.101 --> 00:43:18.873
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

643
00:43:18.873 --> 00:43:20.083
<i>Yes, Grandma.</i>

644
00:43:41.525 --> 00:43:43.242
Did you get home okay yesterday?

645
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:49.581
<i>She's being cold again.</i>

646
00:43:56.394 --> 00:43:58.545
Oh no. Hey, young lady.

647
00:43:58.545 --> 00:43:59.844
Young lady.

648
00:43:59.844 --> 00:44:02.818
We passed the school already.
What are you doing over there?

649
00:44:02.818 --> 00:44:04.358
What are you talking about?

650
00:44:06.862 --> 00:44:08.228
Darn it!

651
00:44:13.045 --> 00:44:15.177
Where am I, seriously?

652
00:44:15.177 --> 00:44:16.746
I've never seen this place before.

653
00:44:16.746 --> 00:44:18.567
I'm going insane here.

654
00:44:18.567 --> 00:44:21.260
Lee Shi Kyung, that jerk,
got off without me.

655
00:44:23.032 --> 00:44:24.813
Can I have the number of a taxi?

656
00:44:24.813 --> 00:44:27.809
I don't know the address, just anything.

657
00:44:52.318 --> 00:44:54.637
<i>Customer, would you like the number?</i>

658
00:44:54.637 --> 00:44:57.032
No, it's okay. It's here.

659
00:45:01.253 --> 00:45:03.813
You got off quickly.
I thought you might end up here.

660
00:45:06.293 --> 00:45:08.639
- You came to pick me up, right?
- Yeah.

661
00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:11.059
Hurry, let's go.
It's on you if we're late.

662
00:45:11.059 --> 00:45:12.759
Okay.

663
00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:16.789
I'm going to go very fast,
so don't fall asleep like before.

664
00:45:31.489 --> 00:45:34.034
Oh no!

665
00:45:39.693 --> 00:45:41.771
Lee Shi Young, are you okay?

666
00:45:41.771 --> 00:45:44.119
- Yes.
- Let me see. Are you hurt?

667
00:45:44.119 --> 00:45:47.614
I'm fine, but what about your bike?

668
00:45:47.614 --> 00:45:49.360
Don't worry about it.

669
00:45:50.099 --> 00:45:52.119
It's old, so it's time to throw it out.

670
00:46:15.635 --> 00:46:16.994
Is he asking for burial clothes?

671
00:46:17.737 --> 00:46:18.777
Yes.

672
00:46:20.425 --> 00:46:23.431
You manage to get the perfect fit
by measuring like that.

673
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:25.090
It's quite amazing.

674
00:46:26.119 --> 00:46:28.112
I am quite smart.

675
00:46:29.532 --> 00:46:33.114
I think this patient is depressed.

676
00:46:33.771 --> 00:46:35.996
Please visit him often, Grandma Duk Boon.

677
00:46:36.626 --> 00:46:39.835
He has no family or a caretaker,
so I always worry about him.

678
00:46:39.835 --> 00:46:43.864
Why is it that the most unfortunate
ones always come in bunches?

679
00:46:45.126 --> 00:46:48.072
Your daughter-in-law
needs to learn a lot from you.

680
00:47:02.952 --> 00:47:05.300
You want us to do
a talent show at the hospice?

681
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.782
Oh no. Come on.

682
00:47:07.782 --> 00:47:10.661
- We don't want to.
- I won't do it.

683
00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.708
- No, no.
- Be quiet. Be quiet.

684
00:47:13.717 --> 00:47:17.302
We did it once before
you all began attending this school.

685
00:47:17.302 --> 00:47:19.887
I was honestly surprised.

686
00:47:19.887 --> 00:47:23.210
The students sang, danced,
and performed comedy.

687
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:27.967
To put it simply, I wondered if it
would be a nuisance to the patients.

688
00:47:28.599 --> 00:47:31.548
But, the patients really liked it.

689
00:47:31.548 --> 00:47:33.199
They laughed together and sang along.

690
00:47:33.199 --> 00:47:34.829
Oh, really?

691
00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:37.239
Can we do whatever we want?

692
00:47:37.239 --> 00:47:38.478
And then what?

693
00:47:39.568 --> 00:47:42.929
Will they not die after we put
on a show and joke around?

694
00:47:42.929 --> 00:47:45.869
The way you all think is super fake.

695
00:47:46.648 --> 00:47:47.760
You're right.

696
00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.847
Just like Yong Gi said,
it can appear super fake.

697
00:47:51.847 --> 00:47:56.043
But, if you look at it another way,
don't we all die anyway?

698
00:47:56.043 --> 00:47:57.905
We are just dying a little later.

699
00:47:59.184 --> 00:48:01.873
Also, if you're dying...

700
00:48:02.735 --> 00:48:04.054
are you not allowed to be happy?

701
00:48:04.054 --> 00:48:05.235
What the...

702
00:48:12.186 --> 00:48:14.193
<i>They like to do all kinds
of nonsense here.</i>

703
00:48:14.193 --> 00:48:15.858
<i>Work hard, everyone.</i>

704
00:48:15.858 --> 00:48:16.927
Lee Shi Kyung.

705
00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:19.510
I was told you had to bring a cactus.

706
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:22.208
Ah... the vice-principal.

707
00:48:26.885 --> 00:48:28.014
<i>[Lee Shi Kyung]</i>

708
00:48:28.014 --> 00:48:31.028
You bought this for 1,000 won
at Flower Heaven in town.

709
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:35.811
You already heard
the cactus story from Ga Ram.

710
00:48:36.943 --> 00:48:39.639
I suppose you're still not moved
by the story at all.

711
00:48:39.639 --> 00:48:41.320
No, I'm not.

712
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:45.378
I want you to collect 10 cacti here
that bear your name.

713
00:48:45.378 --> 00:48:46.771
What?

714
00:48:46.771 --> 00:48:50.568
I'll send you to the Grand Canyon
if you can get 10 here.

715
00:48:50.568 --> 00:48:52.592
You said you wanted to go.

716
00:48:53.173 --> 00:48:55.266
- What do you mean?
- Hmm...

717
00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:57.474
So, the first cactus is...

718
00:48:57.474 --> 00:49:01.394
you participating in the
talent show at the hospice.

719
00:49:02.317 --> 00:49:06.637
- What?
- Why not listen to this lady?

720
00:49:06.637 --> 00:49:09.126
It's a free trip to the Grand Canyon.

721
00:49:09.126 --> 00:49:12.476
So, the conditions are
that I have to do something.

722
00:49:12.476 --> 00:49:15.938
Then, I have to buy a cactus
with my own money.

723
00:49:15.938 --> 00:49:17.115
Bingo.

724
00:49:17.115 --> 00:49:19.585
Will you really send me to the
Grand Canyon if I collect 10?

725
00:49:19.585 --> 00:49:20.719
Yes.

726
00:49:20.719 --> 00:49:23.619
Has anyone ever gone there like that?

727
00:49:23.619 --> 00:49:24.686
Of course.

728
00:49:26.083 --> 00:49:28.882
<i>She's so strange. She is totally strange.</i>

729
00:49:30.237 --> 00:49:31.376
What about Shi Kyung?

730
00:49:31.376 --> 00:49:32.998
He wouldn't do it.

731
00:49:32.998 --> 00:49:35.501
He usually hates group activities.

732
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.951
He should join us.
He's the best looking guy in our school.

733
00:49:41.121 --> 00:49:42.719
Everyone would like it.

734
00:49:42.719 --> 00:49:45.760
Bernard listens well to you,
Park Ga Ram. You ask him.

735
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.425
Should I?

736
00:49:49.338 --> 00:49:50.958
I've been looking all over for you guys.

737
00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:54.384
It's not like you to join in
on something like this.

738
00:49:55.175 --> 00:49:56.927
You got reeled in by the vice-principal.

739
00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:58.161
What do you mean?

740
00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:00.320
I'm just trying out something new.

741
00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.893
That's great. Let's decide what to do,
something easy and unique.

742
00:50:03.893 --> 00:50:06.376
How about cosplay?
That's easy and unique.

743
00:50:06.376 --> 00:50:07.764
Cosplay?

744
00:50:07.764 --> 00:50:09.056
You guys didn't know?

745
00:50:09.056 --> 00:50:11.311
Lee Shi Young is a cosplay maniac.

746
00:50:11.311 --> 00:50:13.836
Wow, I've never met a cosplay maniac.

747
00:50:13.836 --> 00:50:15.639
Who do you like to cosplay?

748
00:50:15.639 --> 00:50:17.041
Maybe Sailor Moon?

749
00:50:17.041 --> 00:50:19.503
"In the name of justice,
I will punish you."

750
00:50:22.909 --> 00:50:24.646
It would be fine if she did Sailor Moon.

751
00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:27.088
She does something weird.
Alice from Wonderland.

752
00:50:27.088 --> 00:50:29.530
Alice from "Alice in Wonderland"?

753
00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:30.827
With the rabbit too?

754
00:50:32.273 --> 00:50:34.887
See? Even the others think it's weird.

755
00:50:35.722 --> 00:50:36.938
Trash.

756
00:50:39.666 --> 00:50:41.380
I won't do it if it's not cosplay.

757
00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:44.550
Shi Young. Lee Shi Young.

758
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.661
Shi Young must be mad because of me.

759
00:50:46.661 --> 00:50:47.751
Leave her alone.

760
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:49.951
She won't do it if it's not cosplay.

761
00:50:49.951 --> 00:50:51.601
What about a classic concert?

762
00:50:51.601 --> 00:50:53.501
We all learned an instrument
last semester.

763
00:50:53.501 --> 00:50:55.797
I can play the piano.

764
00:50:55.797 --> 00:50:57.125
I can't play anything.

765
00:50:57.125 --> 00:50:59.541
Let's think of something else then.

766
00:50:59.541 --> 00:51:02.235
Everyone ends up doing
the same thing in the end.

767
00:51:02.235 --> 00:51:06.543
Dancing, singing, impressions,
lip-syncing, something like that.

768
00:51:06.543 --> 00:51:08.565
Let's just dance.

769
00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:13.143
We could pick a fun song, practice the
moves a little. That would be very easy.

770
00:51:13.143 --> 00:51:14.833
Isn't dancing unoriginal?

771
00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:18.474
We need one good dancer,
but we don't have one.

772
00:51:18.474 --> 00:51:21.123
What about you, Shi Kyung?
Can you dance?

773
00:51:21.123 --> 00:51:23.554
Dance? I can follow along.

774
00:51:23.554 --> 00:51:25.887
- There is someone.
- Who?

775
00:51:25.887 --> 00:51:27.047
Kim Bom.

776
00:51:27.047 --> 00:51:30.927
According to my radar,
Kim Bom is a dancing queen.

777
00:51:30.927 --> 00:51:34.547
Apparently, her dancing is no joke.

778
00:51:34.547 --> 00:51:36.545
<i>Kim Bom is a dancing queen?</i>

779
00:51:36.545 --> 00:51:39.827
With that long hair and
those long arms and legs

780
00:51:39.827 --> 00:51:42.646
she'll go "ooh la, la, la."

781
00:51:43.887 --> 00:51:45.782
Hey, stop that.

782
00:51:45.782 --> 00:51:46.963
What's with you?

783
00:51:46.963 --> 00:51:48.510
Would Bom do it?

784
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:52.570
She misses classes, extracurriculars,
and volunteer events due to headaches.

785
00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:54.789
She barely comes to class.

786
00:51:55.757 --> 00:51:57.978
She asked for Shi Kyung's number before.

787
00:51:57.978 --> 00:52:00.119
Are you two close?

788
00:52:00.119 --> 00:52:01.690
No.

789
00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:05.860
I was supposed to do her
tombstone inscription. That's why.

790
00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.949
Nonetheless, you've spoken to Bom.

791
00:52:07.949 --> 00:52:10.322
It has to be you.

792
00:52:11.621 --> 00:52:14.619
Go get her now. We don't have much time.

793
00:52:20.061 --> 00:52:21.099
Me?

794

802
00:53:06.985 --> 00:53:08.951
<i>Yes, Bom. We'll follow your lead.</i>

803
00:53:08.951 --> 00:53:13.048
<i>As soon as Dad went missing,
and we came to you...</i>

804
00:53:13.048 --> 00:53:14.778
<i>what did you do back then, Grandma?</i>

805
00:53:14.778 --> 00:53:16.695
<i>You didn't want to see us
and kicked us out.</i>

806
00:53:16.695 --> 00:53:18.239
<i>And you didn't see us for 10 years.</i>

807
00:53:18.692 --> 00:53:19.911
<i>Hello.</i>

808
00:53:19.911 --> 00:53:22.110
<i>This is my classmate, Kim Bom.</i>

809
00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:23.438
<i>This is my grandma.</i>

810
00:53:23.438 --> 00:53:24.804
<i>Kim Bom?</i>

811
00:53:24.804 --> 00:53:26.965
<i>Do you want to date me?</i>

812
00:53:30.215 --> 00:53:31.557
<i>My heart is racing.</i>

813
00:53:31.557 --> 00:53:33.735
<i>My heart is racing like crazy.</i>
