3
00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:10.971
Has anything changed?

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:13.611
Do you still talk

5
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:20.551
Like the girl who used to make me laugh?

("Ex-Principal Dancer Min Seo Young Opens a Dance Studio")

7
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:23.950
Goodness.

8
00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:28.321
Oh, she got hurt.

9
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.630
She should've been careful.

10
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.560
What are you doing? I told you to babysit...

11
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:34.361
Oh, right.

12
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.000
What are you doing? Are you...

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.140
Come on, what's with you?

14
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.210
Do you think you're a lustful teenager?

15
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.240
You'll be 40 soon.

16
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.481
I don't believe you.

17
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.240
Do you think it's porn?

18
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:51.210
No, I'm not watching that.

19
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.880
What do you think of me?

20
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.651
I see you as an old guy in heat.

21
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:56.181
I remember finding your secret folder...

22
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.950
Goodness.

23
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.560
Why are you bringing up something from ages ago?

24
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.060
Fine.

25
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:04.461
Look. You can take a look.

26
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.830
Ballerina Min Seo Young?

27
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.841
Why are you reading this article?

28
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.541
There's something called privacy you must keep between couples.

29
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:18.440
I was curious.

30
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:20.341
Why are you curious about her?

31
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:21.741
Why can't I be curious?

32
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:23.211
I wanted to see if she was doing well.

33
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.550
To a guy, his first love stays in his memories for a lifetime.

34
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.720
It's not like I'm seeing her or having an affair.

35
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:30.050
She's just...

36
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.250
right here.

37
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:35.821
It feels like homework which I never got to finish.

38
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.791
That's what first love is.

39
00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:41.030
That darned first love.

40
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.071
How sad are those of us without a first love?

41
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.341
You do have a first love.

42
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.571
Your first love is...

43
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:50.241
right here.

44
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.741
You never liked anyone before me.

45
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:56.280
You got the heart of your first love, dated him, and married him.

46
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:58.780
You did all three.

47
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.151
That's why you wouldn't know how I feel.

48
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.250
What's it like to live with your first love?

49
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:04.491
Is it great?

50
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.050
Tell me. It is, isn't it?

51
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:08.320
Tell me. I'm very curious. I'm dying to know.

52
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.861
How is it? Isn't it great?

53
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:10.991
No.

54
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:12.861
You aren't my first love.

55
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.100
I don't have a first love.

56
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.771
Darn you, woman.

57
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.010
Hey, everyone has a first love.

58
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.470
I'm telling you, I'm your first love.

59
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.880
Why would you decide who my first love is?

60
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.341
I should do that.

61
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.350
And how do you know who's your first love?

62
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.611
Is it the first person you dated? Or kissed?

63
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.451
In that case, I'm your first love, not Min Seo Young.

64
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:37.591
No.

65
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:40.160
The first person that made you tremble just by seeing them,

66
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.220
and made your heart flutter just by thinking about them.

67
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.260
That's a one-sided love, not a first love.

68
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.260
And I never trembled or did my heart flutter whenever I saw you.

69
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.331
From my perspective, you aren't my first love.

70
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.530
- Keep remembering your first love. - Goodness.

71
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.570
One's first love is more dramatic, pure,

72
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.510
and genuine than any kind of love in this world.

73
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.681
Come play with Dad.

74
00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:02.410
But as ardent as that sounds,

75
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:07.480
the definition and standard of those words are very ambiguous.

76
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.220
You're so adorable. Do you want to go down?

77
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.891
(Episode 5, The Standard of First Love)

78
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:12.850
Let's go. Let's go play.

79
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:18.961
(1999, Seoul)

80
00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:20.060
Excuse me.

81
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.230
Thank you.

82
00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.461
Goodness.

83
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.530
Your mom must be glad to have you.

84
00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:26.440
I only have two daughters.

85
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.371
Oh, gosh.

86
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.510
Hey!

87
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.780
Goodness.

88
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:43.690
Mom, go inside.

89
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.220
What's with you?

90
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.491
This young man just...

91
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.921
Mom, just go.

92
00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:50.130
Go first.

93
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.790
- My goodness. - Mom, go.

94
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.630
- Go, okay? - Okay.

95
00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.970
I was just passing by.

96
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.641
How dare you come here?

97
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.910
Are you here to see my mom?

98
00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:18.521
Don't you ever come near my house again.

99
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:36.201
Do you know him?

100
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.180
- No. - Then why did you do that?

101
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:42.711
That young man helped me.

102
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.011
If he helps you again,

103
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.180
just kick him.

104
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:49.350
That jerk.

105
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.451
What's with you?

106
00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:53.490
He looked like a nice and a dependable man.

107
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.191
If you can't thank him,

108
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:57.360
the least you can do is not call him a jerk.

109
00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.930
He's just a jerk...

110
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:00.860
to you and me.

111
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:03.230
The pictures.

112
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.151
(Grapes)

113
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.620
Let's call it a day.

114
00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:23.951
- Great job everyone. - Oh, gosh.

115
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:26.391
- We're all done. - Great job, everyone.

116
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.660
Where are you going?

117
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:33.961
What?

118
00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:38.800
No.

119
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:41.970
You need to put this knee and this arm...

120
00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:44.170
in a straight diagonal line.

121
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:47.381
- Like this. - Oh, diagonally.

122
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.711
Now, again. Ready, go.

123
00:05:56.951 --> 00:05:58.120
Hey.

124
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.290
When can I wear the uniform?

125
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.730
What?

126
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.730
Like your partner... That guy...

127
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.901
How long will it take for me to be like him?

128
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.230
Like this...

129
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.600
And doing something like this.

130
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.391
- Stay right there. - What?

131
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.920
Lift me up.

132
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:23.841
You couldn't talk to her because you liked her so much.

133
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:27.341
She was so pretty that you couldn't even talk to her.

134
00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:29.751
All right. Call Park Shin Young.

135
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.910
- Shin Young! - Good.

136
00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:33.451
She's here.

137
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.490
What? That lady is his first love?

138
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.261
She's not pretty.

139
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.501
She's almost 60. Did you think she'd be pretty?

140
00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:52.501
He probably looked for her because he was curious.

141
00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:54.870
Mom, look at his face.

142
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.711
He's totally disappointed.

143
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.941
It would've been better not to see her.

144
00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:03.280
First love is beautiful when you reminisce.

145
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:05.881
What? Do you have a first love?

146
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.881
Yes, your dad does.

147
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:09.581
The orchard family's second daughter.

148
00:08:09.751 --> 00:08:11.720
He still loves her.

149
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.730
I didn't have time to like anyone because...

150
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.631
I was busy taking care of your uncles.

151
00:08:19.591 --> 00:08:23.470
You should've had a first love. This isn't fair.

152
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.331
What's not fair about it?

153
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:27.201
First love is useless.

154
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:29.071
What counts is your last love.

155
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:32.870
How can you be sure about it?

156
00:08:33.181 --> 00:08:36.110
What? Are you worried about your dad cheating on me?

157
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.081
Come on. Let's eat dinner.

158
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:43.750
Look. Look at his face.

159
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.921
- Hurry up. - Okay.

160
00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:56.671
(The year 2010)

161
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.870
- Get married again? - Yes.

162
00:09:00.941 --> 00:09:02.770
It's lonely to live alone,

163
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.240
and my friends also tell me I should.

164
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.140
Stop kidding, Dad.

165
00:09:09.411 --> 00:09:12.281
Don't you think it's time to let go of your mom?

166
00:09:16.421 --> 00:09:17.650
Let go of Mom?

167
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:23.431
Has it been 10 years since she passed away?

168
00:09:24.461 --> 00:09:25.860
No, it hasn't even been a year yet.

169
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.900
How can you let her go so soon?

170
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.931
How can you let her go?

171
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.270
We should listen to what he has to...

172
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.571
How can it only take a year for you to let go of Mom?

173
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:42.281
I still...

174
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.581
I still feel like Mom would be here smiling when I come home.

175
00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:52.150
I feel like she'd pick up the phone when I call home.

176
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:55.821
So I can't come here or call home.

177
00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.161
Because I'm afraid to really let her go.

178
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.931
But you can let her go?

179
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.000
This easily?

180
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:12.110
You're making Mom so pitiful.

181
00:10:20.681 --> 00:10:21.850
I'm leaving.

182
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.990
Jin Joo.

183
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.120
Excuse me.

184
00:10:42.701 --> 00:10:45.711
What are you doing? Dad was about to eat it.

185
00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:49.140
It's yours, Mom. You eat it.

186
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.850
Here.

187
00:11:08.531 --> 00:11:11.470
Did I make a mistake when I came home drunk?

188
00:11:11.531 --> 00:11:16.000
No, you acted no different from other days you were drunk.

189
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.140
My daughters.

190
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.010
- Daddy's home. - Gosh. Stop it.

191
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.081
- Goodness. Eun Joo. - You hate me?

192
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.951
- Mom! - You hugged them and kissed them.

193
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.880
You talked to the plants.

194
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.291
I, Pan Seok, am not dead yet.

195
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.760
You know that, right?

196
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:40.760
That's it!

197
00:11:41.661 --> 00:11:43.571
She hates getting kissed.

198
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:47.500
No, she wouldn't sulk for so long because of that.

199
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.171
You aren't secretly reading her diary these days.

200
00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:53.441
That's it.

201
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:56.980
Did you read it again?

202
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.750
I was really careful. How did she know?

203
00:12:00.081 --> 00:12:01.750
Great job.

204
00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:04.191
Why did you read her diary? She's all grown up.

205
00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:06.191
You're really strange.

206
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:07.691
I'm worried.

207
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:10.561
What if some strange guys are hitting on her?

208
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.730
She's an adult. She should be dating guys now.

209
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.571
No. I raised her so dearly. She can't just date anyone.

210
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:20.500
You know how dangerous it is out there?

211
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.110
Also men are all jerks.

212
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.740
Right.

213
00:12:27.211 --> 00:12:28.880
Jerk.

214
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.480
Whoever she dates, I'll screen him at least 10 times.

215
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.490
Goodness.

216
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.220
My daughters won't be able to marry anyone.

217
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.331
Then I'll live with my babies forever.

218
00:12:44.961 --> 00:12:46.091
My babies.

219
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:49.600
My babies.

220
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.370
Seo Jin, I miss you.

221
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.600
I miss you so very much.

222
00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:50.831
Seo Jin.

223
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.770
Why are you still in your room?

224
00:14:07.341 --> 00:14:08.441
What's wrong?

225
00:14:08.911 --> 00:14:10.110
It's nothing.

226
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.010
No, it's something. You were crying.

227
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:14.051
It's because I had a weird dream.

228
00:14:14.181 --> 00:14:15.281
Really?

229
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:19.591
You're acting strange these days.

230
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.091
You even had a dream that I was dying.

231
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.061
Should I get you some herbal medicine?

232
00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:30.730
What's this hug for?

233
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.640
Mom.

234
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:36.970
My mom.

235
00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:40.010
I love you so much.

236
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:46.921
You're acting really strange.

237
00:14:46.921 --> 00:14:49.691
Why do you keep clinging on to me when you're all grown up?

238
00:14:49.821 --> 00:14:51.520
Goodness.

239
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:14.411
Are you going to school already?

240
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.610
No. Take me with you.

241
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:24.951
She has been having dialysis regularly for five years.

242
00:15:25.321 --> 00:15:27.161
She doesn't have any problems.

243
00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:31.230
Well... She's okay now,

244
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.931
but if she keeps getting dialysis...

245
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.571
won't she have complications in 10 years?

246
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.541
Complications can happen in 10 years or tomorrow.

247
00:15:41.671 --> 00:15:45.270
You can't stop dialysis because of that.

248
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:50.010
Still, can you treat her so that she wouldn't have any...

249
00:15:50.081 --> 00:15:53.581
We're doing our best to avoid complications.

250
00:15:53.951 --> 00:15:56.720
Your mom can live a long life.

251
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.520
So don't worry too much.

252
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.480
By whose standards is she going to live long?

253
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.421
She's only going to live 10 more years.

254
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.490
Her kids must have searched a lot about her disease.

255
00:16:34.591 --> 00:16:35.760
They even know about complications.

256
00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:38.260
Her son visited yesterday.

257
00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:41.201
That patient doesn't have a son.

258
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.071
She only has two daughters.

259
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:46.000
Wake up, Choi Ban Do!

260
00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:54.181
Wake up!

261
00:16:55.811 --> 00:16:57.211
What? You're awake?

262
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:00.650
Good morning, Mom.

263
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:02.421
Dad.

264
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.690
I won't take it away from you. I won't.

265
00:17:07.091 --> 00:17:08.690
Not everyone can become rich.

266
00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.261
If you act like such a miser and doubt everyone like that...

267
00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:12.890
You jerk!

268
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.301
Where did you learn to speak to your dad like that?

269
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.801
You never listen to me when I tell you to wake up.

270
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.200
What's wrong with you recently?

271
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.670
- Is this cabbage juice? - Just take a sip.

272
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.071
This is good for your stomach.

273
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:33.781
It takes like a mop.

274
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.581
I know it tastes bad,

275
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.150
but it's good for your stomach.

276
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:40.920
Thank you, Mom. I'm going to school now. Goodbye.

277
00:17:43.331 --> 00:17:44.960
He never drinks that.

278
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.860
What's wrong with him today?

279
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.150
Seongbuk-dong 31, please.

280
00:18:13.221 --> 00:18:14.460
We're here.

281
00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:29.940
Keep pace with others!

282
00:18:31.241 --> 00:18:35.311
Left foot, left foot, left foot, left foot.

283
00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.710
You must be doing your morning training.

284
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:39.311
Yes.

285
00:18:39.311 --> 00:18:40.751
How's school?

286
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.791
If you need anything, just tell me. I'll do everything for you.

287
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.091
And please tell your father about me.

288
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.420
In that case,

289
00:18:49.731 --> 00:18:51.261
as I don't want to come to school,

290
00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:53.630
will you just give me the diploma?

291
00:18:54.261 --> 00:18:57.031
It'll be nice to get some scholarship too.

292
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.001
Gosh, I forgot that I had a meeting.

293
00:19:01.301 --> 00:19:02.341
I'll see you next time.

294
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:05.140
Oh, my, Jung Yu Ra!

295
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.140
Isn't he the university president?

296
00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:11.610
See? I knew there was something going on.

297
00:19:12.081 --> 00:19:14.221
He must be the son of a rich man or a politician.

298
00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:15.380
- Politician? - Yes.

299
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.051
Who dares to talk during exercise?

300
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:20.960
Gosh, you surprised me.

301
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.531
What are you doing?

302
00:19:24.591 --> 00:19:25.731
Go away.

303
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.430
Wait.

304
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.721
It tastes better if you have someone to eat with.

305
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.591
I'm not eating by myself.

306
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.571
- Why does snacks take so much time? - I know, right?

307
00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:07.170
I was talking about me.

308
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.571
What's he doing?

309
00:20:09.971 --> 00:20:12.981
He asked me not to get friendly. I don't get him.

310
00:20:20.781 --> 00:20:21.880
What's he doing?

311
00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:30.731
Nam Gil,

312
00:20:30.731 --> 00:20:32.690
you must be troubled because of Jin Joo.

313
00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:35.900
Gosh, it was the first time she's been asked out by a man.

314
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.571
Gosh, she's so old-fashioned.

315
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.801
It wasn't like that.

316
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.541
What?

317
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.410
He didn't ask me out.

318
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.241
I didn't ask her out.

319
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.541
I'm flirting with her.

320
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:55.751
Are you done?

321
00:21:01.491 --> 00:21:02.620
What are you doing? Follow me.

322
00:21:04.731 --> 00:21:05.991
Go on.

323
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.031
- Hurry. - Go.

324
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.410
He likes Jin Joo, right?

325
00:21:18.841 --> 00:21:19.981
I think so.

326
00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.511
She refused him, but he's still flirting with her.

327
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.680
Then he'd like her in any situations, right?

328
00:21:26.751 --> 00:21:29.551
Whether or not she's divorced and has a child.

329
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:32.620
These are such extreme examples. Eat up.

330
00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:43.430
I understand that he's going through a stormy period at his age,

331
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.541
but I really don't know what he's thinking.

332
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.670
I...

333
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.771
thought you told me not to get friendly.

334
00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:52.440
And that you didn't ask me out.

335
00:21:52.981 --> 00:21:55.241
But you're flirting with me? Me?

336
00:21:57.081 --> 00:21:58.210
Not me, you.

337
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:00.420
You are flirting with me.

338
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.180
I didn't do that.

339
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.190
I didn't flirt with anyone.

340
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.751
You've been flirting with me...

341
00:22:05.751 --> 00:22:08.061
the last few days, very actively.

342
00:22:09.731 --> 00:22:11.561
Gosh, I can't believe this.

343
00:22:11.791 --> 00:22:14.100
I've had people flirt with me,

344
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.100
but I have never flirted with anyone before in my life.

345
00:22:17.331 --> 00:22:19.670
What happened at the main gate...

346
00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:20.801
was just an accident.

347
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.041
The library...

348
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.271
was also an accident...

349
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.781
Right.

350
00:22:28.011 --> 00:22:29.410
How's your leg?

351
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.880
Does it hurt?

352
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.150
You should apply ice pack frequently so that it won't hurt later.

353
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.420
You know, if you sprain a body part and don't take good care of it,

354
00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:41.390
it will last forever.

355
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.630
See? You're flirting with me.

356
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:45.731
Why do you keep saying that?

357
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.501
- This is what flirting looks like. - What?

358
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.430
If you're going to do that, you may as well help me with my bags.

359
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.200
It's partly your fault after all.

360
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.140
You don't look sick enough to need my help.

361
00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:01.781
It doesn't show,

362
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.180
but it feels like my skin is ripping apart whenever I walk.

363
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.781
Really?

364
00:23:05.781 --> 00:23:07.521
Gosh, you shouldn't leave it like that.

365
00:23:07.981 --> 00:23:09.021
Wait, wait.

366
00:23:10.821 --> 00:23:12.190
How come you don't...

367
00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:14.120
know where to stop?

368
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.501
What's wrong with him?

369
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:29.001
What are you listening to?

370
00:23:29.771 --> 00:23:30.971
You surprised me.

371
00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:34.781
Why? Is that surprising?

372
00:23:37.081 --> 00:23:38.281
This is cool.

373
00:23:39.081 --> 00:23:40.281
Gosh.

374
00:23:40.981 --> 00:23:42.850
I mean it.

375
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.221
A combination of ballerina and hip-hop music.

376
00:23:47.791 --> 00:23:48.890
It's cool.

377
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:51.831
I thought you'd only listen to classical music because of ballet.

378
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.531
So you like this kind of music.

379
00:23:56.731 --> 00:23:57.801
It's fun, right?

380
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.531
Yes, yes!

381
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.301
hip-hop music has exciting beats.

382
00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.241
It's not like boring classical music.

383
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.741
It'd be fun to dance to this music.

384
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:09.981
Then do it.

385
00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:12.981
I can't do that kind of dance.

386
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.551
Ballet.

387
00:24:14.551 --> 00:24:15.721
Ballet is a type of dance, right?

388
00:24:16.291 --> 00:24:18.021
Can't you dance ballet to hip-hop music?

389
00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.521
Of course not.

390
00:24:20.521 --> 00:24:22.360
How would I dance ballet to hip-hop music?

391
00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:24.160
Really?

392
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.960
Well, I really must not have known you very well.

393
00:24:28.031 --> 00:24:29.670
We've only known a while.

394
00:24:29.971 --> 00:24:31.071
I know.

395
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.600
So we should get to know more.

396
00:24:33.301 --> 00:24:34.440
About what?

397
00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:36.670
Things about you that I didn't know about.

398
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.541
And about what I was like in the past.

399
00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.120
I don't remember being dumped.

400
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.960
Then why didn't I even ask her out and give up?

401
00:24:53.561 --> 00:24:54.620
Gosh.

402
00:24:55.221 --> 00:24:56.331
Give up what?

403
00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:58.860
Origami? Are you making cranes or turtles?

404
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.430
That's so out of fashion.

405
00:25:00.801 --> 00:25:02.831
People make roses now.

406
00:25:07.741 --> 00:25:10.170
What's that cloth on your hair?

407
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.370
Cloth?

408
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.981
Don't you know about H.O.T's bandanas?

409
00:25:14.481 --> 00:25:15.541
You're lying.

410
00:25:15.541 --> 00:25:18.311
You don't want people to know you're the one that got his head stuck.

411
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.880
Gosh, it was because of you.

412
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.261
It's too bitter for me.

413
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.091
Okay! Herbal medicine!

414
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.261
Hey, he kissed Bo Reum...

415
00:25:33.261 --> 00:25:35.900
and didn't brush his teeth since yesterday.

416
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.670
Gosh, that's so dirty.

417
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.410
Are you going out with Yoon Bo Reum?

418
00:25:44.771 --> 00:25:45.870
Why do you sound surprised?

419
00:25:47.581 --> 00:25:49.910
Yoon Bo Reum, that witch, ruined my life.

420
00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:53.981
I curse her.

421
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.420
I hope she ends up in a fiery pit.

422
00:25:57.221 --> 00:25:58.521
I pity myself.

423
00:25:59.551 --> 00:26:01.190
I feel so bad for me.

424
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.491
Only if I hadn't dated her...

425
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:08.160
Why does this guy keep repeating his painful history?

426
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.531
That's not dating.

427
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.940
That was just a peck. That wasn't a real kiss.

428
00:26:15.541 --> 00:26:18.140
- Same thing. - How are they the same thing?

429
00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.841
It was a peck, not a kiss.

430
00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:21.910
There's a song that goes like this.

431
00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.680
"When you meet, you kiss hello. When you leave, you kiss goodbye."

432
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.120
I give my niece a peck every day. Does that mean I'm dating her?

433
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:33.721
If we aren't dating, why would she kiss my lips?

434
00:26:34.561 --> 00:26:37.860
There are a few progressive women like her.

435
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.731
If you go abroad, they kiss to greet each other.

436
00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:44.900
Gosh, Bo Reum. I had no idea that she was such an open person.

437
00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:47.801
She's very open in every single way.

438
00:26:47.801 --> 00:26:49.370
You're amazing, Bo Reum.

439
00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.140
Do you get it? Two.

440
00:26:52.241 --> 00:26:57.150
I'm sure she wouldn't have kissed me if she wasn't going to date me.

441
00:26:58.051 --> 00:26:59.950
I'm a man too.

442
00:27:07.991 --> 00:27:10.731
- Hey. - I thought you'd run away.

443
00:27:15.761 --> 00:27:18.400
What was that? Is that all?

444
00:27:20.001 --> 00:27:21.440
Hold me right here.

445
00:27:22.241 --> 00:27:23.610
- Right here? - Yes.

446
00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:25.471
And one. Lift me up like that.

447
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:26.841
- Okay? - Yes.

448
00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.410
There are a few progressive women like her.

449
00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.081
Bo Reum isn't your average girl.

450
00:27:35.081 --> 00:27:37.551
She's rather physical.

451
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.190
Like this. Great.

452
00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.860
- Okay. - Okay, good.

453
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.460
Great job.

454
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.341
You should give me your bag.

455
00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.940
Did you pester me to carry just this for you?

456
00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.581
Just this? Do you know how expensive that is?

457
00:28:05.081 --> 00:28:09.481
Nam Gil, I baked this with a lot of love all night.

458
00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.521
It's good. Have some.

459
00:28:12.021 --> 00:28:14.120
My gosh, those are the good days.

460
00:28:14.991 --> 00:28:18.190
You baked it with love all night. You should have it.

461
00:28:23.331 --> 00:28:24.430
Oh, my.

462
00:28:34.281 --> 00:28:37.281
I picked this awful thing up from the trash can. Have some.

463
00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.410
Would you take it if I say that?

464
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.991
She made it all night for you. Why won't you take it?

465
00:28:44.051 --> 00:28:46.491
What if I do take it? Nothing in this world is free.

466
00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:47.761
Give and take.

467
00:28:47.761 --> 00:28:49.991
If I take something. I need to give something back.

468
00:28:49.991 --> 00:28:52.761
Why would I do that with someone I don't even like?

469
00:28:53.801 --> 00:28:57.400
I doubt she wanted anything when she offered you that.

470
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.501
She just likes you,

471
00:28:58.501 --> 00:29:00.640
so she wanted to do things and give you food.

472
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.011
She's got that heart of a mom.

473
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.370
Isn't what she did adorable?

474
00:29:07.081 --> 00:29:10.511
Do you think parents don't expect something from you?

475
00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:12.650
What's with this guy?

476
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.321
He's oddly twisted.

477
00:29:15.821 --> 00:29:17.950
- Give that to me. - What?

478
00:29:19.761 --> 00:29:20.860
You told me to take it.

479
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.460
Isn't it because you want to do things for me and give me food?

480
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.660
No, not me...

481
00:29:33.971 --> 00:29:35.571
I'll see you here at 7pm.

482
00:29:37.241 --> 00:29:38.511
I can't drive because of my leg.

483
00:29:40.341 --> 00:29:41.581
Take this.

484
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.811
Bring it then.

485
00:29:44.251 --> 00:29:45.350
Bye.

486
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.420
Your leg is fine.

487
00:29:53.021 --> 00:29:56.591
What was that? Is he hurt, or isn't he?

488
00:29:58.491 --> 00:30:00.900
If you do this, will you not get kicked out?

489
00:30:02.001 --> 00:30:04.200
I have to tick off my penalty points with volunteering.

490
00:30:05.031 --> 00:30:08.501
This is all because of that traitor, Jae Woo.

491
00:30:10.311 --> 00:30:11.541
Oh, hello.

492
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.341
Okay.

493
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.380
Number 85.

494
00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.321
How come that young kid is looking so masculine?

495
00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:24.051
He's older than you. Don't you know him?

496
00:30:24.251 --> 00:30:25.450
He's famous...

497
00:30:25.791 --> 00:30:27.521
as the hottest guy on campus.

498
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.491
He's tall, handsome, and has a great fit.

499
00:30:31.591 --> 00:30:33.600
Some say he's a grandson of a major company.

500
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.860
Oh, really?

501
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.400
And some say he's a son of the Minister of Defense.

502
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.140
But in my opinion, I think he's got even a bigger secret.

503
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.811
He's a M.F.S.

504
00:30:44.311 --> 00:30:45.571
What? M what?

505
00:30:45.571 --> 00:30:48.041
A M.F.S. Mom's friend's son.

506
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.950
Is he your mom's friend's son?

507
00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.251
Never mind.

508
00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.960
Hey, can you take this to the dressing room?

509
00:31:05.061 --> 00:31:06.231
The women's?

510
00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:08.331
You crazy idiot. Leave it.

511
00:31:20.841 --> 00:31:22.880
(Black Joe)

512
00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:25.981
She's a history major. Her name is Ma Jin Joo.

513
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.821
What if Ye Rim finds out?

514
00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:30.821
You worked so hard to get her to date you.

515
00:31:31.091 --> 00:31:32.521
I won't let her find out.

516
00:31:32.721 --> 00:31:34.120
I'll just fool around with her for a bit.

517
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.860
I mean, look at her. She's kind of pretty,

518
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.031
but she looks like someone who doesn't have a penny.

519
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.761
She's a perfect girl to fool around with.

520
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.700
And Ye Rim is my source of money for life.

521
00:31:45.331 --> 00:31:46.501
I won't let her go.

522
00:31:49.041 --> 00:31:50.741
Gosh, what a guy.

523
00:32:03.765 --> 00:32:06.997
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E05 Go Back Couple "The Standard of First Love"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

524
00:32:18.971 --> 00:32:20.071
What is this?

525
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:23.271
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

526
00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:24.741
I thought you were my friend.

527
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:26.610
You pushed me very hard.

528
00:32:27.741 --> 00:32:30.051
I'm sorry. Sorry.

529
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:38.850
Seo Young, I'm so sorry.

530
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.721
I'm sorry that the tickets are wasted too.

531
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:44.860
It's okay. I'll watch it alone.

532
00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.930
- Go. - I'm sorry.

533
00:32:47.231 --> 00:32:48.261
It's fine. Go.

534
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:49.700
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

535
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.650
Can't you dance ballet to hip-hop music?

536
00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:35.000
See? That did work.

537
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.141
Why couldn't you do it before?

538
00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:39.011
I was just trying it out for fun.

539
00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.911
You should do it for a living, not for fun.

540
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:44.051
Then it'll be a fun way of making a living.

541
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:45.911
What?

542
00:34:46.321 --> 00:34:50.121
It's not easy to find something you find fun in your life.

543
00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:53.091
What you want to do doesn't always align with what you need to do.

544
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:56.460
If that doesn't happen, you need to make that happen.

545
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.801
If you focus too much on the things you need to do,

546
00:34:59.801 --> 00:35:02.060
nothing will be left when you can't do what you need to do anymore.

547
00:35:02.261 --> 00:35:05.201
If you did something fun, at least you got that experience.

548
00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.540
You're a good talker.

549
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.871
I'm serious.

550
00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:14.380
What if you can't dance anymore later in life because of an injury?

551
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.051
Nothing lasts forever.

552
00:35:18.011 --> 00:35:20.951
So you should do what you want in that moment.

553
00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.681
Is that so?

554
00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:26.420
While we're at it, what do you want to do right now?

555
00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:29.860
Here.

556
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.690
Why are you giving it to me already? Follow me.

557
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.871
You lied.

558
00:35:38.201 --> 00:35:39.641
It doesn't look like you're hurt.

559
00:35:39.741 --> 00:35:41.071
You're fine.

560
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.810
I'm on my way to the hospital.

561
00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.141
The hospital?

562
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.580
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

563
00:35:50.951 --> 00:35:52.951
I'll take the bag too. I can carry it.

564
00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:55.750
I'm stronger than I look.

565
00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.020
It must really hurt.

566
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:06.730
Is this for real?

567
00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:08.900
Did you get these to watch a movie with me?

568
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:11.471
I told you my friends couldn't go...

569
00:36:12.071 --> 00:36:14.400
This is the third time telling you this.

570
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.741
What?

571
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:22.980
- Gosh. - Goodness.

572
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.511
- Are you okay? - Yes.

573
00:36:31.721 --> 00:36:33.460
- Gosh. - What's going on?

574
00:36:35.491 --> 00:36:36.630
Goodness.

575
00:36:41.201 --> 00:36:42.261
Grab on.

576
00:36:47.201 --> 00:36:49.101
You don't want to fall.

577
00:36:59.351 --> 00:37:00.520
- Gosh. - Goodness.

578
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.351
Drive carefully.

579
00:37:11.891 --> 00:37:13.931
My blood vessels.

580
00:37:13.931 --> 00:37:16.031
They're alive. Choi Ban Do.

581
00:37:16.031 --> 00:37:18.770
You're the man.

582
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.681
Is this the movie theater?

583
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.411
Well...

584
00:37:32.011 --> 00:37:33.880
It has to be this one, right?

585
00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.181
It must be this one, right?

586
00:37:36.551 --> 00:37:38.851
Yes, because I got tickets for this theater.

587
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.261
No way.

588
00:37:42.261 --> 00:37:44.630
It's a huge place. I'm sure we won't bump into each other.

589
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.241
It's three dollars.

590
00:37:56.411 --> 00:37:57.411
Okay.

591
00:38:06.011 --> 00:38:08.451
I need to go to the bathroom.

592
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:15.860
Here you go.

593
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:20.661
Why does it have to be here?

594
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:22.730
This is terrible.

595
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.801
No.

596
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:28.871
I'm not doing anything wrong.

597
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.270
I'm not cheating on her.

598
00:38:30.411 --> 00:38:32.310
Right. Choi Ban Do.

599
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.341
Be confident. Straighten your shoulders.

600
00:38:34.411 --> 00:38:35.681
All right. Let's go!

601
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.360
Right. I'm not doing anything wrong.

602
00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.101
Why do I...

603
00:38:55.161 --> 00:38:56.500
feel so nervous?

604
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.000
Wait.

605
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.741
What? Why is she here?

606
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:05.641
Gosh.

607
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:15.650
M.F.S?

608
00:39:19.891 --> 00:39:21.091
What's wrong?

609
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.431
You said you were going to a hospital.

610
00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.701
I'll feel better after watching a movie.

611
00:39:27.301 --> 00:39:28.701
Watching it alone is boring.

612
00:39:29.101 --> 00:39:30.900
See? You were faking it.

613
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.371
Goodness.

614
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.241
I shouldn't be here.

615
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:37.040
I'm sorry. I had to go the bathroom.

616
00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:38.241
Gosh.

617
00:39:39.781 --> 00:39:41.480
It's so good.

618
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.650
Oh, right.

619
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:45.781
Nam Gil.

620
00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.520
When you said you liked me...

621
00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:50.451
I didn't say...

622
00:39:50.451 --> 00:39:51.750
I mean...

623
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:53.060
when you asked me out.

624
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.060
Yes.

625
00:39:55.161 --> 00:39:57.661
That was already quite a while ago.

626
00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:02.560
I'm your first love.

627
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.400
I never had a first love,

628
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.031
but I was someone's first love.

629
00:40:07.871 --> 00:40:09.741
- Who? - You don't believe me?

630
00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:10.971
My college senior.

631
00:40:10.971 --> 00:40:13.741
He was hot, super rich, and popular.

632
00:40:13.741 --> 00:40:14.841
He even said he liked me.

633
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.380
Really?

634
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.580
Lady, stop watching TV.

635
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.250
You're getting good at lying. Are you writing a script?

636
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:22.821
Why would a hot, rich, popular guy like you?

637
00:40:23.091 --> 00:40:24.290
I'm not lying.

638
00:40:24.991 --> 00:40:26.860
You're delusional.

639
00:40:28.221 --> 00:40:30.830
It's you. You're that guy.

640
00:40:31.761 --> 00:40:32.931
M.F.S.

641
00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:36.130
Why? Did he get shot or something?

642
00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:37.871
Goodness. Sure.

643
00:40:38.101 --> 00:40:40.440
It's nice only when you're remembered as first love.

644
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.071
You haven't seen this, right?

645
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.071
Right. No, I haven't seen it.

646
00:40:46.681 --> 00:40:48.641
It's getting rave reviews.

647
00:40:48.641 --> 00:40:51.051
They say people cry because it's really sad.

648
00:40:51.181 --> 00:40:52.210
Come on.

649
00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.480
It's can't be that sad. It's your typical melodrama.

650
00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.991
I wouldn't cry watching this.

651
00:41:08.161 --> 00:41:09.500
(Back in 1999)

652
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.601
Don't...

653
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.670
Don't do that.

654
00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:19.341
(2004)

655
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.321
(2017)

656
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:31.391
No.

657
00:41:33.661 --> 00:41:34.721
Gosh.

658
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:37.391
By the way, I haven't been here in so long.

659
00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:39.560
I used to come here all the time in college.

660
00:41:40.801 --> 00:41:42.301
You're still in college.

661
00:41:42.301 --> 00:41:43.701
You're a freshman.

662
00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:46.400
Sometimes you talk like a middle-aged man.

663
00:41:47.201 --> 00:41:48.301
What?

664
00:41:50.571 --> 00:41:53.210
I'm not a middle-aged man.

665
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.341
I mean I like that.

666
00:41:55.341 --> 00:41:56.911
I like people who are old-fashioned.

667
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:58.810
I feel comfortable.

668
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.520
You like that?

669
00:42:17.531 --> 00:42:18.701
You aren't crying.

670
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.301
- Good work. - Good job.

671
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:53.471
Do men hate it...

672
00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:56.201
when women kiss them first?

673
00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:59.071
No. We love it! Thank you very much.

674
00:42:59.071 --> 00:43:00.710
Please introduce her to me.

675
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.281
Me first.

676
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:04.281
What's wrong with him then?

677
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.420
What about women asking men out first?

678
00:43:08.781 --> 00:43:09.991
A woman asking a man out?

679
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.051
Well, that's a bit...

680
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.821
What? Why should it matter?

681
00:43:14.821 --> 00:43:16.991
Hey, men have pride to uphold.

682
00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:19.900
Men should be given a chance to ask women out first.

683
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.130
Don't you think so?

684
00:43:24.701 --> 00:43:25.770
Come here and have a drink.

685
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:28.371
- Hurry up. Why are you so late? - We already started.

686
00:43:28.371 --> 00:43:29.471
Come on.

687
00:43:29.471 --> 00:43:31.040
Hurry up.

688
00:43:31.411 --> 00:43:34.281
For men, first love...

689
00:43:34.281 --> 00:43:36.110
lasts forever, until we die.

690
00:43:36.181 --> 00:43:37.650
Who is your first love?

691
00:43:37.851 --> 00:43:40.621
A girl from church in middle school.

692
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:44.351
What about you, Jae Woo?

693
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:45.920
- Me? - Yes.

694
00:43:49.491 --> 00:43:50.790
I was in kindergarten.

695
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.931
She made my heart flutter.

696
00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.900
They say the shy ones always more precocious.

697
00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.301
- Jae Woo. - You were so mature.

698
00:44:01.641 --> 00:44:02.701
Eat up.

699
00:44:03.871 --> 00:44:06.710
That's unrequited love, idiots.

700
00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:08.380
Did you go out with them?

701
00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.451
No. How could I have dated my teacher?

702
00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:13.420
She didn't even know me.

703
00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.880
That's not first love. That's unrequited love.

704
00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.491
You're completely mistaken.

705
00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:20.420
First love doesn't mean someone you liked for the first time.

706
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.321
It's the first person you dated.

707
00:44:23.491 --> 00:44:26.360
Being in a relationship is called love.

708
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.730
To love and to be loved. It has to be both ways.

709
00:44:29.261 --> 00:44:32.301
If you aren't in a relationship, then it's nothing.

710
00:44:32.471 --> 00:44:33.571
It's unrequited love.

711
00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:36.201
No!

712
00:44:36.371 --> 00:44:37.841
She was my first love.

713
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.480
My heart still races for her.

714
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.221
Why did she kiss me when we weren't even dating.

715
00:44:52.221 --> 00:44:53.520
Gosh.

716
00:44:53.721 --> 00:44:55.360
Is it so hard to ask me out?

717
00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:58.391
Waiting like this will give me cancer.

718
00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:18.210
Hey, Jae Woo.

719
00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.821
If you step away, we're over.

720
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.730
What?

721
00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:30.931
Did we do anything?

722
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.591
We weren't even going out.

723
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.201
- It was just an unrequited love. - What?

724
00:45:35.201 --> 00:45:37.201
Because you're so freewheeling,

725
00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:40.101
you might consider a kiss as a greeting. But...

726
00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:41.601
that's not the case for me.

727
00:45:42.741 --> 00:45:45.071
Why would you kiss someone you aren't even dating?

728
00:45:45.071 --> 00:45:46.841
I might be nothing to you,

729
00:45:46.841 --> 00:45:48.040
but to me you are...

730
00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.851
my first love.

731
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.121
You said your first love was in kindergarten.

732
00:45:56.121 --> 00:45:58.051
You said she made your heart flutter.

733
00:45:58.051 --> 00:45:59.721
How would I remember that? I didn't know anything then.

734
00:45:59.721 --> 00:46:02.221
And you told me, if we don't go out, it's one-sided love.

735
00:46:02.221 --> 00:46:04.130
Yes, so you were in a one-sided love with me too.

736
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.031
No, you're my first love.

737
00:46:09.201 --> 00:46:11.630
So what do you want to do with me?

738
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:13.801
What?

739
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:15.641
What do you want to do with me?

740
00:46:18.871 --> 00:46:20.011
I want to go out with you.

741
00:46:21.341 --> 00:46:22.580
I don't want one-sided love.

742
00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.411
I want to go out with you.

743
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.190
You asked me out, okay?

744
00:46:45.471 --> 00:46:46.571
You're not crying.

745
00:46:46.841 --> 00:46:49.201
Love stories aren't sad.

746
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.641
There are so many things to cry about other than that.

747
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.710
So what?

748
00:46:59.181 --> 00:47:00.321
Hey.

749
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.290
Hello, Father-in-law.

750
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.091
Who are you?

751
00:47:09.761 --> 00:47:11.830
I'm just a passerby.

752
00:47:19.841 --> 00:47:22.371
He's my friend from school. Just my friend.

753
00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:24.270
He's my dad.

754
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:28.141
Hello, I'm Jung Nam Gil.

755
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.681
Give it to me.

756
00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.520
I hurt my leg a little, so...

757
00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.161
Don't think of this as weird.

758
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:43.761
He's really just a friend.

759
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.400
Hello.

760
00:47:47.301 --> 00:47:50.170
Jin Joo, I'm going home right now. Do you want to go with me?

761
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:52.701
No, you should go first.

762
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.601
Should I?

763
00:47:54.841 --> 00:47:57.210
Then have fun. Take your time.

764
00:48:03.351 --> 00:48:04.511
Are you going to stay a little longer with me?

765
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:08.250
Did Dr. Han's treatment heal your legs completely?

766
00:48:09.121 --> 00:48:12.891
I'll consider your legs completely healed from now on. Goodbye.

767
00:48:14.161 --> 00:48:15.290
Ma Jin Joo.

768
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.060
I picked up something.

769
00:48:19.261 --> 00:48:21.500
I need to go to the police station. Do you want to go with me?

770
00:48:31.011 --> 00:48:32.610
Why did you do that just before?

771
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.141
What?

772
00:48:34.841 --> 00:48:35.980
I...

773
00:48:36.951 --> 00:48:38.810
I thought he was someone I knew.

774
00:48:39.781 --> 00:48:41.920
So he must have been a father.

775
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.391
- What? - What kind?

776
00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.051
Where did you meet him?

777
00:48:46.621 --> 00:48:49.790
Yes, a father.

778
00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:51.830
I...

779
00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.431
If you want to have fun, come out and dance with us!

780
00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:30.531
Here!

781
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:33.741
Hey!

782
00:49:55.621 --> 00:49:56.960
Is she dancing ballet to hip-hop music?

783
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.730
Dancing ballet to hip-hop music works.

784
00:50:36.101 --> 00:50:38.571
It worked because they helped me at the back.

785
00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:40.900
- Did you have fun? - Yes, it was so fun!

786
00:50:41.341 --> 00:50:42.571
It's a good thing I pushed you.

787
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:46.980
You were destined to dance there.

788
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.710
Yes, we were destined...

789
00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.681
to watch a movie together.

790
00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:53.781
You learn fast.

791
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.690
I lost it in a taxi.

792
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:35.591
I picked it up at school. At the parking lot.

793
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:50.170
How did you know it was mine?

794
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:52.210
There wasn't any identification cards inside.

795
00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.310
I asked around.

796
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:59.551
But is that how you should be acting towards someone who found it?

797
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.991
Well, I...

798
00:52:04.851 --> 00:52:05.951
Thank you.

799
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:09.321
So I'm buying this.

800
00:52:10.031 --> 00:52:13.101
But I think you're lying about your sprain.

801
00:52:13.101 --> 00:52:15.730
It must be very important to you whether or not I hurt my leg.

802
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:17.601
If it's true, I feel sorry.

803
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:21.371
And it worries me that I could have hurt you.

804
00:52:21.801 --> 00:52:24.641
You look rich. If you got hurt, go to the hospital.

805
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:27.380
Do I? Why?

806
00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.310
Don't you look at the mirror?

807
00:52:29.411 --> 00:52:32.150
You are wearing expensive clothing from head to bottom.

808
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:35.621
Your watch and car look expensive too.

809
00:52:35.621 --> 00:52:37.121
Gosh, you're covered with money.

810
00:52:37.121 --> 00:52:39.690
Nice catch.

811
00:52:40.821 --> 00:52:43.591
But even if I dress up like this, people don't tend to notice.

812
00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:47.900
- Are you a snob? - Snob?

813
00:52:50.471 --> 00:52:52.270
Anyone can know that.

814
00:53:00.341 --> 00:53:02.181
Maybe not.

815
00:53:11.991 --> 00:53:13.121
It's strange.

816
00:53:15.891 --> 00:53:17.560
Do you have a split personality?

817
00:53:18.761 --> 00:53:21.701
Or is there something wrong with your tear ducts?

818
00:53:22.301 --> 00:53:23.531
Is that why you cry so much?

819
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.601
What?

820
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:28.141
What are you talking about?

821
00:53:38.511 --> 00:53:41.520
What's wrong with him? He's making me feel uncomfortable.

822
00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:50.190
You found my wallet, so I'll repay you generously.

823
00:53:55.301 --> 00:53:56.601
Do you like anything in particular?

824
00:53:58.531 --> 00:53:59.670
You.

825
00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:04.741
I think it's true.

826
00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:08.641
I think I like you.

827
00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.440
You didn't have to come here when your leg hurts.

828
00:54:40.641 --> 00:54:41.911
I could've walked here by myself.

829
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:44.150
My leg got completely healed after watching the movie.

830
00:54:45.351 --> 00:54:47.721
Then you'll be all right tomorrow too.

831
00:54:49.821 --> 00:54:50.951
It...

832
00:54:51.491 --> 00:54:53.321
looked all right today.

833
00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:57.431
Goodbye.

834
00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.060
Bye.

835
00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.181
Take a seat.

836
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:41.601
So you're in the same major. What grade are you in?

837
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:42.971
I'm in my fourth year.

838
00:55:42.971 --> 00:55:45.040
- So you're graduating soon? - Yes.

839
00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:47.341
What did you do after watching the movie?

840
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:49.080
Pardon? Well...

841
00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.051
We went to get a drink.

842
00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:53.121
A drink? Just one drink?

843
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.920
No, I had about four glasses,

844
00:55:56.221 --> 00:55:58.491
and Jin Joo had about three.

845
00:55:58.491 --> 00:55:59.621
Three glasses?

846
00:55:59.621 --> 00:56:01.091
Can she really drink three glasses of beer?

847
00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:02.560
By the glass,

848
00:56:02.621 --> 00:56:04.460
or by the 500ml mug?

849
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:06.091
The mug.

850
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.761
Oh, so you're a good drinker.

851
00:56:09.971 --> 00:56:11.431
- What do your parents do? - Oh...

852
00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:13.270
They're in education.

853
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.141
So...

854
00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:18.071
If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to.

855
00:56:18.571 --> 00:56:20.681
To be honest, he is the director of our school.

856
00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:26.721
Hankook University?

857
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.551
The school which Jin Joo goes to?

858
00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:29.920
Yes.

859
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:32.750
But please don't mention it to Jin Joo.

860
00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.891
- No one knows about this. - Oh, right.

861
00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:39.391
And you shouldn't mention that we've met to her.

862
00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.161
Man-to-man. All right?

863
00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.170
- Yes. - So...

864
00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:45.770
do you like her a lot?

865
00:56:46.341 --> 00:56:48.071
- Pardon? - You must like her a lot...

866
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:51.341
to watch a movie with her and drink four glasses of beer.

867
00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.141
Yes, a bit...

868
00:56:56.511 --> 00:56:57.650
No, I mean,

869
00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.051
I like her a lot.

870
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.681
Oh, my.

871
00:57:32.781 --> 00:57:33.951
Hi.

872
00:57:35.221 --> 00:57:37.290
Why are you standing here? Don't you have an umbrella?

873
00:57:37.721 --> 00:57:39.351
It didn't rain when I got here.

874
00:57:41.091 --> 00:57:42.560
Is there anywhere I can get one?

875
00:57:43.161 --> 00:57:45.060
You don't need to buy one. I've got one here.

876
00:57:45.931 --> 00:57:47.360
Let's share. Come here.

877
00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:58.371
Eat that, and stop crying.

878
00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:00.540
Why do you always cry?

879
00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:02.880
You're like someone I know.

880
00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:26.371
Goodness, who made this awful umbrella?

881
00:58:56.431 --> 00:58:57.601
Just fold it.

882
00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:59.230
It tried its best.

883
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:07.911
Then I'll walk with you to wherever you were going.

884
00:59:26.601 --> 00:59:30.170
This little kid is being rather smooth like a serpent.

885
00:59:31.201 --> 00:59:32.701
He's making this old lady's heart flutter.

886
00:59:34.201 --> 00:59:35.801
Wait, is he a player?

887
00:59:36.641 --> 00:59:37.710
Hey.

888
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:39.011
Yes?

889
00:59:40.181 --> 00:59:42.011
Can you come a little closer to me?

890
00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:44.710
Listen to him! He is a player.

891
00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:47.451
If we walk like this, I'll get wet.

892
00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.161
I mean, it's my umbrella.

893
00:59:54.690 --> 00:59:55.920
Oh, right.

894
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:57.591
Goodness, I'm sorry.

895
01:00:09.371 --> 01:00:10.841
It'll stop soon, right?

896
01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:12.540
I hope so.

897
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.210
It's the festival season too.

898
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:57.321
(Epilogue)

899
01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.551
(What really happened in 1999)

900
01:00:58.551 --> 01:00:59.591
I'll pour you a glass too.

901
01:00:59.591 --> 01:01:02.190
(What really happened in 1999)

902
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:04.060
What will you do after you graduate?

903
01:01:06.531 --> 01:01:09.261
I'll do anything and everything to provide...

904
01:01:09.261 --> 01:01:10.431
for Jin Joo.

905
01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:12.601
So exactly what?

906
01:01:12.601 --> 01:01:14.170
What do you want to do, or what do you like?

907
01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:18.170
What do I like? I... I like Jin Joo.

908
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:19.980
I mean, I like...

909
01:01:20.741 --> 01:01:24.250
everything that Jin Joo likes.

910
01:01:24.451 --> 01:01:26.351
You're a man. Don't you have any dreams?

911
01:01:26.351 --> 01:01:27.781
No, I do, sir.

912
01:01:27.781 --> 01:01:28.920
My dream...

913
01:01:29.181 --> 01:01:32.551
is to live happily with Jin Joo and our children.

914
01:01:32.551 --> 01:01:33.621
What?

915
01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:37.261
This doesn't mean you can date her. This is only the first audition.

916
01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:39.230
You know, it's like an application screening.

917
01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:42.031
You have a long way to go until you pass the finals.

918
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:45.170
Yes, I'll do my best until the very end...

919
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:47.400
without ever giving up.

920
01:01:48.641 --> 01:01:49.770
Stop smiling.

921
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.110
I might grow fond of you.

922
01:01:51.371 --> 01:01:52.810
You'll make me lose my judgment.

923
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.741
Of course. I'm sorry, Father.

924
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:59.150
I'm not your father.

925
01:02:00.681 --> 01:02:03.020
Then are you my father-in-law...

926
01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:04.321
Father-in-law?

927
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.690
Well, then... Just Mr. Ma?

928
01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.091
Goodness.

929
01:02:35.781 --> 01:02:38.920
(Go Back Couple)

930
01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.391
Are you already dating someone when we don't know when we'll go back?

931
01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:43.130
You two were so close.

932
01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.560
Speak for yourself.

933
01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.931
He never showed up during festivals before. What's with him?

934
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:51.071
Nam Gil, where have you been?

935
01:02:51.371 --> 01:02:52.500
Are you hungry?

936
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.741
Ma Jin Joo!

937
01:02:54.241 --> 01:02:56.571
- Is something going on? - One of the contestants are gone.

938
01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:58.571
You can't be the May Queen.

939
01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:00.241
You should be glad if you aren't the last place.

940
01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.281
Ma Jin Joo, a history major.

941
01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:06.380
Hey, isn't that the same girl that you wanted to hit on?

942
01:03:06.821 --> 01:03:08.951
You should hurry. She'll be taken soon.
