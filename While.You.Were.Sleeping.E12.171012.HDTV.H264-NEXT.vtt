1
00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:11.575
A man named Kang Dae Hee attacked me in your dream?

2
00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:14.305
What is the case you're covering these days?

3
00:00:14.644 --> 00:00:17.714
Anything dangerous or might lead to grudges?

4
00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:19.944
Anything relevant to death benefit insurances?

5
00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:21.815
Not at all.

6
00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:25.654
I'm covering cats, not even humans. Street cats.

7
00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:27.025
Street cats?

8
00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:29.924
Yes. Someone killed the cats with potassium poison.

9
00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:31.125
They told me to cover this news.

10
00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:32.795
Oh, that's a relief.

11
00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:34.494
How's that a relief?

12
00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:37.335
They treat me like a freshman because I just got back to work.

13
00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:39.634
Isn't it better than doing something dangerous?

14
00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:41.664
And why is your reaction so timid?

15
00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:44.075
Aren't you scared that I dreamed of you dying as a reporter?

16
00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:45.775
This could be the dream.

17
00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:47.704
Not this dream, at least.

18
00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:50.914
Where was the place?

19
00:00:52.644 --> 00:00:53.785
Was it in the mountain?

20
00:00:54.184 --> 00:00:55.184
No, it wasn't.

21
00:00:56.214 --> 00:00:58.285
Did you see a green umbrella?

22
00:00:59.115 --> 00:01:00.125
No, I didn't.

23
00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:02.654
See? This isn't the dream.

24
00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:04.295
Any dream is okay except that one.

25
00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:10.434
When I crossed the road holding your hand,

26
00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:13.265
I let go of all the fear, worries, and everything else.

27
00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:14.704
Otherwise, I can't be a reporter.

28
00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:18.535
You changed.

29
00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:19.605
Because of whom?

30
00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:27.085
Kang Dae Hee is in trial now.

31
00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:29.345
A smart prosecutor named Shin Hee Min is in charge of it.

32
00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:30.684
Kang Dae Hee won't be free.

33
00:01:31.214 --> 00:01:32.454
There is no need for you to worry ahead.

34
00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:36.224
Instead, promise me something.

35
00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:38.394
Promise?

36
00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:43.224
It's annoying.

37
00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:46.934
Spilling records before a trial means something bad.

38
00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:49.765
Just forget about it. It could have been worse.

39
00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:54.075
It's all because of Prosecutor Jung. He has a big mouth.

40
00:01:57.644 --> 00:02:00.115
I'm sorry I have a big mouth.

41
00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:04.684
What now? You want to see the record and criticize?

42
00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:09.025
I know you will do well today, but please do your best.

43
00:02:09.184 --> 00:02:12.625
What are you doing? Are you teasing me now? How ridiculous.

44
00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:15.125
Just cheering you up as your junior. I mean it.

45
00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:25.075
Please plead guilty for Kang Dae Hee.

46
00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:27.105
Prosecutor Shin Hee Min.

47
00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:36.345
Okay.

48
00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:46.865
Are you okay?

49
00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:48.295
You did that on purpose!

50
00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:50.134
No I didn't. I'll help you.

51
00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:51.765
Get out of my sight.

52
00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:55.535
- Are you alright? - No I'm not alright.

53
00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:23.164
Prosecutor Lee.

54
00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:24.765
What brought you here?

55
00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:26.694
I'm free for a few minutes.

56
00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:29.805
You came because you're nervous about him getting no charges.

57
00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.474
What are you talking about? I believe in Min Hee.

58
00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:42.644
Accused Kang Dae Hee, on the day his brother died,

59
00:03:42.644 --> 00:03:45.384
has searched the following things on his mobile phone.

60
00:03:45.615 --> 00:03:47.724
When we link all his search words,

61
00:03:47.724 --> 00:03:50.724
we can tell his motives on why he has killed and his paths too.

62
00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:54.724
The accused has intentionally hit Domun Tunnel and killed his brother.

63
00:03:54.765 --> 00:03:56.865
Then he looked for any witnesses at the crime scene.

64
00:03:57.065 --> 00:03:59.894
He was scared that his motive will be revealed if the body...

65
00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:02.734
goes under autopsy, so he researched on how to avoid it.

66
00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:04.734
He hurried with cremating the dead body.

67
00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:08.644
During the funeral, he has searched for...

68
00:04:09.045 --> 00:04:10.244
"How to claim insurance for the deceased”.

69
00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:11.875
In the end,

70
00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:18.184
he has claimed 2.7 million dollars, a price for his dead brother.

71
00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:22.585
What a bad guy. What trash.

72
00:04:24.394 --> 00:04:27.765
If you assume that he killed him and link all these key words,

73
00:04:28.825 --> 00:04:30.494
it becomes a crime scenario.

74
00:04:31.194 --> 00:04:34.835
However, if he didn't kill him...

75
00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:36.035
and look again at his search words, it becomes another story.

76
00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:42.174
The accused didn't want to ruin the dead's body.

77
00:04:42.174 --> 00:04:44.244
He wanted to pay respect to his brother.

78
00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:47.345
That's why he searched, "How not to go through autopsy".

79
00:04:47.785 --> 00:04:51.285
Due to a financial reason, he couldn't hold the funeral for long.

80
00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:54.724
So he had to shorten the funeral as it costs less and searched for...

81
00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:58.795
"how to cremate". His sadness over losing a brother...

82
00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:01.224
didn't come before his tiredness of not having money.

83
00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:06.094
He came to think of the insurance. And he thought it was the last gift.

84
00:05:07.164 --> 00:05:08.534
That is why he searched for all these keywords.

85
00:05:08.965 --> 00:05:10.304
This also makes sense.

86
00:05:10.905 --> 00:05:12.375
That doesn't make sense.

87
00:05:16.474 --> 00:05:20.184
His difficult financial status has won over his sadness...

88
00:05:20.315 --> 00:05:21.914
of losing his brother. How could he pay 4,000 dollars per month...

89
00:05:21.914 --> 00:05:23.284
for the insurance?

90
00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:28.525
The accused has often paid penalties for not wearing seat belts.

91
00:05:28.755 --> 00:05:30.255
But on the day of the accident,

92
00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:32.125
only Kang has worn the seat belt.

93
00:05:32.494 --> 00:05:35.625
His brother did not wear the seat belt. Is this a coincidence?

94
00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:39.235
He often paid the penalty for it. That's why he worn it that day.

95
00:05:39.235 --> 00:05:42.565
He paid penalties even after the car accidents.

96
00:05:42.664 --> 00:05:44.335
How would you explain this?

97
00:05:44.905 --> 00:05:45.905
She's doing well.

98
00:05:47.405 --> 00:05:48.675
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:57.385 --> 00:05:58.414
Are you sleepy?

100
00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:02.855
Yes, Da Hee. I'll get some sleep.

101
00:06:03.795 --> 00:06:06.155
My work was tough today. I'm tired.

102
00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:08.664
Get some sleep.

103
00:06:09.724 --> 00:06:11.235
I will wake you up later.

104
00:06:12.494 --> 00:06:13.835
As you can see,

105
00:06:13.835 --> 00:06:18.105
the dash cam in the car was moved to face upwards.

106
00:06:18.304 --> 00:06:21.675
What was it that he did not want to record?

107
00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:24.574
If he didn't want to record, he should have removed it.

108
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:27.815
As you can hear from the recording, the brothers were...

109
00:06:27.844 --> 00:06:31.684
in such a good relationship.

110
00:06:35.025 --> 00:06:36.795
As I listen, there is one thing to clarify.

111
00:06:40.494 --> 00:06:41.965
Why didn't you want an autopsy?

112
00:06:42.224 --> 00:06:43.295
If it was a car accident,

113
00:06:44.094 --> 00:06:46.565
there is no need for you to skip the autopsy.

114
00:06:48.164 --> 00:06:51.304
I have a reason, of course.

115
00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:53.175
What is it?

116
00:06:53.974 --> 00:06:56.304
He did not die in the car accident.

117
00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:02.644
(Witness)

118
00:07:05.215 --> 00:07:08.025
You were the first to arrive at the scene, right?

119
00:07:08.224 --> 00:07:10.125
Could you describe how it was when you were saving him?

120
00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:12.994
The driver's seat was okay.

121
00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:17.135
However, the passenger's seat was completely destroyed...

122
00:07:17.195 --> 00:07:20.164
because it hit the gate. So I couldn't really tell.

123
00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:24.304
The driver, the accused sitting over there. Was he conscious?

124
00:07:24.775 --> 00:07:26.945
Yes.

125
00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:28.144
Did he ask to save his brother at the passenger's seat?

126
00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:29.605
No.

127
00:07:31.574 --> 00:07:32.574
That's all.

128
00:07:36.085 --> 00:07:37.614
I have read the medical record,

129
00:07:37.614 --> 00:07:40.625
and it says he didn't bleed much.

130
00:07:41.385 --> 00:07:45.954
The passenger's seat was completely destroyed.

131
00:07:46.764 --> 00:07:48.094
But the deceased did not bleed. It sounds odd, right?

132
00:07:49.525 --> 00:07:50.934
The car accident was big,

133
00:07:51.565 --> 00:07:52.994
but he didn't bleed much.

134
00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:57.175
What does it mean to have a scar but no blood?

135
00:07:57.474 --> 00:08:01.474
That is possible when...

136
00:08:01.744 --> 00:08:02.775
the scar is made after death.

137
00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:08.985
Your honor, the lawyer is making hypothetical statements.

138
00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:11.885
I'm only making a point that the victim did not die due to the car accident.

139
00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:13.985
I'm only supporting my claims.

140
00:08:14.224 --> 00:08:16.925
You're saying the victim did not die of car accident?

141
00:08:16.925 --> 00:08:20.425
To us, the claim by the prosecutor that the victim died...

142
00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:21.994
in a car accident sounds more like a...

143
00:08:23.264 --> 00:08:24.894
a hypothetical statement than truth.

144
00:08:28.764 --> 00:08:31.735
Then please provide evidence to your claim.

145
00:08:33.744 --> 00:08:38.114
The victim's body temperature right after the accident was 35˚C.

146
00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:40.914
Isn't this too low to be considered as a temperature right after death?

147
00:08:40.985 --> 00:08:45.054
Yes, when a person dies, the temperature drops by 1.5˚C per hour.

148
00:08:45.054 --> 00:08:47.585
This means that the differences were more than 1.5˚C.

149
00:08:47.585 --> 00:08:50.025
Which means it has been more than one hour since his death?

150
00:08:50.554 --> 00:08:53.494
- Yes. - It says his oxygen level is zero.

151
00:08:53.994 --> 00:08:57.135
Is the number normal?

152
00:08:57.135 --> 00:08:58.735
No, not usually right after death.

153
00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:01.434
It should take more than 1 hour to reach zero.

154
00:09:01.434 --> 00:09:02.864
All his records here prove that the victim died...

155
00:09:03.304 --> 00:09:06.235
before the car accident.

156
00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:08.074
These records proved the fact.

157
00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:13.684
This is not a hypothetical statement.

158
00:09:28.864 --> 00:09:31.264
Lawyer Lee is claiming that the victim didn't die...

159
00:09:31.264 --> 00:09:33.434
in the car accident.

160
00:09:33.534 --> 00:09:34.905
The victim was already dead before the accident.

161
00:09:34.905 --> 00:09:36.735
- Really? - Yes, sir.

162
00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:40.445
Didn't you go to examine too?

163
00:09:40.605 --> 00:09:43.175
- Yes. - You said it was a simple accident.

164
00:09:43.175 --> 00:09:45.344
It was a simple car accident,

165
00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:47.744
but the victim didn't bleed much.

166
00:09:48.585 --> 00:09:51.215
My goodness. Lawyer Lee is holding on to that.

167
00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.355
Whether he died in the car accident or not,

168
00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:57.394
the victim was killed for the death benefit insurances, right?

169
00:09:57.394 --> 00:10:00.724
No, it's a whole different story now.

170
00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:04.264
My goodness, look.

171
00:10:04.364 --> 00:10:07.635
A prosecutor already prosecuted him for killing in the car accident.

172
00:10:07.635 --> 00:10:09.864
If this was not a car accident that killed the victim,

173
00:10:09.864 --> 00:10:12.704
no matter how the victim died, this trial will state an acquittal.

174
00:10:12.704 --> 00:10:14.105
No, let's say that...

175
00:10:14.105 --> 00:10:16.914
the victim died of something else.

176
00:10:16.914 --> 00:10:19.974
The victim was in the car before and after the car.

177
00:10:19.974 --> 00:10:21.815
And it was only the victim and his older brother in the car.

178
00:10:21.844 --> 00:10:24.085
Then there is only one person that is likely to kill the other.

179
00:10:24.085 --> 00:10:25.755
How can he plead innocence?

180
00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:28.585
He could have died of a heart attack.

181
00:10:32.394 --> 00:10:36.494
On the day of incident, the victim had a tough day delivering mails.

182
00:10:36.735 --> 00:10:40.364
And while asleep, the victim could have died of a heart attack.

183
00:10:40.364 --> 00:10:42.505
After his death, the car accident happened.

184
00:10:42.505 --> 00:10:44.775
- It doesn't make sense. - It does make the least sense.

185
00:10:45.034 --> 00:10:49.105
I personally would like to know how the victim died too.

186
00:10:50.445 --> 00:10:52.045
It really is a pity.

187
00:10:52.445 --> 00:10:54.184
If we went through an autopsy,

188
00:10:54.744 --> 00:10:56.585
either of us will have a solid proof by now.

189
00:10:57.715 --> 00:11:01.585
However, neither side has a solid proof.

190
00:11:01.684 --> 00:11:04.394
Any indirect proofs should not have any contradiction.

191
00:11:04.394 --> 00:11:05.855
The victim's body temperature, oxygen saturation level,

192
00:11:05.855 --> 00:11:07.925
and the 911 man's statements...

193
00:11:09.295 --> 00:11:11.934
all contradict to what the prosecutor said.

194
00:11:14.735 --> 00:11:15.835
Of course, the incident may give a thought that...

195
00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:19.735
the accused killed his brother.

196
00:11:19.934 --> 00:11:22.405
However, even if there is a 99 percent of confident belief...

197
00:11:22.775 --> 00:11:26.644
If there is even one percent chance of a victim's death by heart attack,

198
00:11:29.085 --> 00:11:30.315
then the accused is innocent.

199
00:11:48.164 --> 00:11:51.235
If not killed in a car accident, how did you kill your brother?

200
00:11:51.804 --> 00:11:52.934
Potassium cyanide, the poison.

201
00:11:53.704 --> 00:11:58.074
At first, the street cats were making so much noise.

202
00:11:58.074 --> 00:12:00.215
So I fed it to the cats to kill them.

203
00:12:01.414 --> 00:12:04.355
The result was immediate. 100 percent.

204
00:12:05.155 --> 00:12:06.485
Why would you do this to your brother?

205
00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:11.025
The car accident doesn't guarantee it 100 percent.

206
00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:13.465
If he regains consciousness by any chance, I'll be in trouble.

207
00:12:14.164 --> 00:12:15.594
So I used potassium cyanide poison.

208
00:12:16.164 --> 00:12:17.965
It works 100 percent.

209
00:12:18.764 --> 00:12:19.934
And the police don't know this?

210
00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:23.775
No, they don't know.

211
00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:26.034
They will never find out because I cremated the body.

212
00:12:36.414 --> 00:12:38.514
It's obvious Kang Dae Hee killed his brother.

213
00:12:38.585 --> 00:12:40.485
Do we really have to accept that he is innocent?

214
00:12:40.485 --> 00:12:42.425
We prosecuted him wrong in the first place.

215
00:12:43.155 --> 00:12:44.954
If not car accident, then what?

216
00:12:45.425 --> 00:12:47.764
I know I shouldn't say this now.

217
00:12:48.795 --> 00:12:50.364
But why didn't you do an autopsy?

218
00:12:51.034 --> 00:12:53.605
This is all because you didn't do an autopsy.

219
00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.565
That's because...

220
00:12:57.775 --> 00:13:00.775
All the doctors and policemen said it was a car accident.

221
00:13:00.844 --> 00:13:02.875
The dead's family was crying in sadness.

222
00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:06.074
How could we ask to dissect the naked corpse?

223
00:13:06.074 --> 00:13:09.215
It was a difficult thing to ask the family.

224
00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:13.684
Can't we issue another warrant on the day of his release?

225
00:13:13.985 --> 00:13:16.155
If we release him like this, he'll commit a bigger crime.

226
00:13:16.155 --> 00:13:19.755
Issue a warrant on what? We don't know how he died.

227
00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:21.364
- Chief Prosecutor! - Come on.

228
00:13:21.364 --> 00:13:24.335
I don't want to release the suspect either!

229
00:13:24.335 --> 00:13:26.635
But we can't ignore all the laws and issue a warrant on nothing.

230
00:13:26.635 --> 00:13:28.235
We can't arrest him for nothing.

231
00:13:28.664 --> 00:13:29.934
It is a huge matter.

232
00:13:30.605 --> 00:13:33.005
If we don't know how the victim died, the suspect will be innocent.

233
00:13:37.045 --> 00:13:38.514
Seoul Hangang District Court,

234
00:13:38.514 --> 00:13:39.945
Criminal Investigation Department Two...

235
00:13:40.344 --> 00:13:42.014
will now announce the verdict.

236
00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:47.954
2016, case number 2029. The accused Kang Dae Hee,

237
00:13:49.025 --> 00:13:52.224
to this murder case,

238
00:13:52.355 --> 00:13:55.625
is not charged with falsifying the car accident killing,

239
00:13:55.894 --> 00:14:00.034
but is claiming that the victim was dead before the accident.

240
00:14:00.264 --> 00:14:02.565
He is denying on the charge of murdering the victim.

241
00:14:05.074 --> 00:14:07.304
According to the evidence that the prosecutor has submitted,

242
00:14:07.704 --> 00:14:12.945
the accused has put a huge amount of insurances under the victim.

243
00:14:13.715 --> 00:14:15.985
Despite his difficult financial status,

244
00:14:16.445 --> 00:14:19.614
he has put in a tremendous amount for insurance every month.

245
00:14:19.614 --> 00:14:20.824
He has maintained this unreasonable amount of insurances.

246
00:14:21.454 --> 00:14:23.994
He has also claimed the death benefits...

247
00:14:23.994 --> 00:14:25.295
during his own brother's funeral.

248
00:14:25.855 --> 00:14:29.594
Facts subject to judgement do exist in indirect presumptions.

249
00:14:31.795 --> 00:14:33.465
However, in this case,

250
00:14:34.135 --> 00:14:37.304
we are unsure if the victim was killed in the car accident.

251
00:14:38.405 --> 00:14:41.844
We are also uncertain if the motive of the accused is clear.

252
00:14:41.844 --> 00:14:44.775
These questions still remain here.

253
00:14:46.474 --> 00:14:48.284
With the above indirect presumptions,

254
00:14:48.784 --> 00:14:52.054
the charge does not have enough evidence.

255
00:14:52.315 --> 00:14:55.824
Furthermore, there is no direct evidence to prove the case.

256
00:14:59.224 --> 00:15:00.965
The charge to this case...

257
00:15:01.764 --> 00:15:04.864
only applies to when the crime has no other evidence.

258
00:15:05.835 --> 00:15:09.335
By the later part of Criminal Law Article 325,

259
00:15:09.735 --> 00:15:12.905
I hereby sentence acquittal to the accused.

260
00:15:19.929 --> 00:15:23.161

261
00:15:28.025 --> 00:15:29.184
The guy is worse than a worm.

262
00:15:31.855 --> 00:15:34.425
I had to shake hands with the guy with a smile.

263
00:15:48.375 --> 00:15:50.275
You changed a lot, Lee Yu Beom.

264
00:15:56.485 --> 00:15:57.485
Yu Beom.

265
00:16:00.485 --> 00:16:02.255
What is it? You followed me?

266
00:16:02.425 --> 00:16:03.724
Kang Dae Hee has no charge.

267
00:16:04.295 --> 00:16:06.625
You are done with this case. So please tell me.

268
00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:08.525
If it wasn't the car accident how did he kill him?

269
00:16:08.925 --> 00:16:09.925
You know it, don't you?

270
00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:23.204
Yu Beom, please. Please tell me how he killed him.

271
00:16:23.574 --> 00:16:26.144
I have to know, so I can issue a new arrest warrant.

272
00:16:26.175 --> 00:16:27.284
Why do you ask me?

273
00:16:28.114 --> 00:16:30.514
You have to find out yourself. Why do you ask me?

274
00:16:30.914 --> 00:16:31.954
Yu Beom.

275
00:16:32.114 --> 00:16:33.284
This is over.

276
00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:37.425
What you are doing is begging me to slip you an answer.

277
00:16:38.925 --> 00:16:42.724
Kang Dae Hee, that bastard, has put so much insurances...

278
00:16:42.894 --> 00:16:45.264
under his younger sister too. If we let him go, he'll kill her too.

279
00:16:45.394 --> 00:16:47.704
If he kills more people now, you're the one to blame!

280
00:16:48.704 --> 00:16:49.704
Me?

281
00:16:51.275 --> 00:16:52.335
Why would you blame it on me?

282
00:16:53.204 --> 00:16:55.344
Even if he kills more people, I have nothing to do with it.

283
00:16:56.074 --> 00:16:59.045
It's the prosecutors' fault who could not give enough evidence!

284
00:17:00.244 --> 00:17:02.284
So who told you all to presume it before you have the proof?

285
00:17:02.284 --> 00:17:04.755
You should have had the evidence to find one guilty!

286
00:17:07.925 --> 00:17:10.054
I have done my part as his lawyer.

287
00:17:10.954 --> 00:17:13.824
Whatever comes next, it has nothing to do with me.

288
00:17:14.925 --> 00:17:16.025
It's you all prosecutors' duty.

289
00:17:18.695 --> 00:17:19.994
So learn from it.

290
00:17:49.594 --> 00:17:54.034
Why is he so obsessed with Prosecutor Shin's case?

291
00:17:54.164 --> 00:17:56.405
I shouldn't say this now,

292
00:17:56.775 --> 00:18:00.375
but maybe Prosecutor Jung likes Prosecutor Shin.

293
00:18:02.974 --> 00:18:05.474
Right, you shouldn't say this now.

294
00:18:27.164 --> 00:18:28.264
(Little Pup)

295
00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:31.934
(Youngdeok Crab)

296
00:18:33.474 --> 00:18:36.844
Hey. Prosecutor Jung, what's up? You never call me.

297
00:18:36.914 --> 00:18:37.974
Where are you?

298
00:18:38.074 --> 00:18:42.215
I'm at the Third Patrol Station, investigating street cats.

299
00:18:42.784 --> 00:18:43.885
Nothing is going on, right?

300
00:18:44.514 --> 00:18:47.385
I hope something is wrong, so I can report something.

301
00:18:47.385 --> 00:18:49.925
If something goes wrong, call me immediately.

302
00:18:49.925 --> 00:18:51.855
Got it, sir.

303
00:18:54.965 --> 00:18:57.364
Sorry, I took too much of your time.

304
00:18:59.235 --> 00:19:01.764
No, it's fine. Let me send you home.

305
00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:08.775
But it's really quiet these days. I don't have anything to tell you.

306
00:19:08.775 --> 00:19:09.905
Have you questioned around?

307
00:19:10.005 --> 00:19:11.844
Yes, little kids told me that they saw...

308
00:19:11.844 --> 00:19:14.844
a man giving cats some chickens.

309
00:19:14.844 --> 00:19:17.554
But we couldn't conclude it on a specific person.

310
00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:20.824
Chicken?

311
00:19:26.324 --> 00:19:28.695
I've seen a man feeding chicken to cats too.

312
00:19:29.324 --> 00:19:31.994
- Oh, really? You know the man? - Yes.

313
00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:36.264
Why on earth did Kang Dae Hee attack Hong Joo?

314
00:19:36.465 --> 00:19:38.005
They have nothing in common.

315
00:19:40.034 --> 00:19:41.804
All these records here,

316
00:19:41.804 --> 00:19:44.775
prove that the victim has died before...

317
00:19:45.414 --> 00:19:46.545
the car accident.

318
00:19:47.614 --> 00:19:49.715
Someone killed the cats with potassium poison.

319
00:19:49.715 --> 00:19:50.954
They told me to cover this news.

320
00:19:52.414 --> 00:19:53.425
No way.

321
00:19:54.525 --> 00:19:55.554
Mr. Choi.

322
00:19:56.994 --> 00:20:00.125
I wasn't texting, okay? I was reading some spam texts.

323
00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:02.295
When you examined the victim's body for Kang Dae Hee's case,

324
00:20:02.295 --> 00:20:04.434
was there any possibility that he was poisoned?

325
00:20:05.195 --> 00:20:08.335
I'm not sure. I haven't even thought of it.

326
00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:16.675
You are scaring me!

327
00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.914
Something crossed my mind when you said "poison".

328
00:20:19.315 --> 00:20:20.315
The color of his blood!

329
00:20:20.315 --> 00:20:21.844
The color of his blood?

330
00:20:21.985 --> 00:20:23.855
Yes, usually the color of blood is blueish red.

331
00:20:24.155 --> 00:20:27.324
But the victim's blood color was pinkish, close to orange.

332
00:20:30.554 --> 00:20:31.795
What do you mean by that?

333
00:20:31.894 --> 00:20:36.025
This is a symptom for those who are infected with that.

334
00:20:36.025 --> 00:20:37.664
That thing. That.

335
00:20:37.664 --> 00:20:40.534
The one used to kill people in the past. That thing!

336
00:20:40.534 --> 00:20:43.474
- Potassium cyanide? - Yes! That's right!

337
00:20:43.735 --> 00:20:46.405
The blood turns green if you take it!

338
00:20:51.914 --> 00:20:53.885
Prosecutor Jung! Where are you going?

339
00:20:53.945 --> 00:20:55.914
Prosecutor Jung!

340
00:21:10.795 --> 00:21:12.835
(Chicken)

341
00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:29.784
Cho Hee. You were here.

342
00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:31.585
You were worried about me, right?

343
00:21:35.655 --> 00:21:36.655
Cho Hee.

344
00:21:36.655 --> 00:21:38.155
I was on your side, Dae Hee.

345
00:21:38.855 --> 00:21:40.565
No matter what the prosecutor says...

346
00:21:41.824 --> 00:21:45.594
I said my brother wouldn't do such a thing.

347
00:21:47.565 --> 00:21:48.605
You know that too, right?

348
00:21:49.005 --> 00:21:50.034
Sure, I do.

349
00:21:51.675 --> 00:21:53.945
I'm here because of what you said.

350
00:21:58.775 --> 00:22:02.244
I went to see your trial.

351
00:22:06.755 --> 00:22:09.454
Why? I told you not to.

352
00:22:14.864 --> 00:22:16.764
The voice from your dash cam.

353
00:22:19.434 --> 00:22:21.434
It wasn't his voice.

354
00:22:23.474 --> 00:22:25.135
Both voices were yours.

355
00:22:39.614 --> 00:22:40.655
Are you sleepy?

356
00:22:42.284 --> 00:22:45.625
Yes, Dae Hee. I'll get some sleep.

357
00:22:46.155 --> 00:22:48.525
My work was tough today. I'm tired.

358
00:22:49.795 --> 00:22:52.735
Get some sleep. I'll wake you up later.

359
00:22:59.034 --> 00:23:00.074
Dae Hee,

360
00:23:01.045 --> 00:23:03.675
did you really kill him?

361
00:23:14.954 --> 00:23:17.425
(Chicken)

362
00:23:20.965 --> 00:23:22.764
- Is this the place? - Yes.

363
00:23:22.925 --> 00:23:26.695
I saw the owner giving some chickens to cats.

364
00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:27.934
Really?

365
00:23:33.844 --> 00:23:36.445
You should wait here. Call the police if something happens.

366
00:23:36.744 --> 00:23:37.744
What?

367
00:23:41.315 --> 00:23:42.385
Hello? Anyone?

368
00:23:44.085 --> 00:23:45.855
Sir, is everything okay?

369
00:23:48.585 --> 00:23:50.094
Are you okay over there?

370
00:23:54.894 --> 00:23:55.925
Sir?

371
00:24:27.525 --> 00:24:28.824
Little bastard.

372
00:24:33.565 --> 00:24:35.505
- Gosh. - Goodness.

373
00:24:35.605 --> 00:24:36.605
Woo Tak!

374
00:24:52.355 --> 00:24:53.385
Run, Hong Joo!

375
00:24:56.385 --> 00:24:57.425
Run!

376
00:25:48.744 --> 00:25:49.775
Goodness.

377
00:26:01.684 --> 00:26:02.724
Do you have a cell phone?

378
00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:04.554
No, it's at the shop.

379
00:26:04.554 --> 00:26:05.594
Goodness. What to do I do?

380
00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:23.875
Hello? Please speak. Where are you now?

381
00:26:24.414 --> 00:26:28.144
Hello?

382
00:26:44.664 --> 00:26:46.934
I told her to just go. This is making me mad!

383
00:27:20.804 --> 00:27:23.605
Promise me something, Hong Joo.

384
00:27:24.405 --> 00:27:25.405
Promise?

385
00:27:26.005 --> 00:27:28.074
If something dangerous happens to you,

386
00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:31.614
I can see it in my dream beforehand.

387
00:27:35.184 --> 00:27:36.284
Jae Chan.

388
00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:40.385
If you see this moment in your dream...

389
00:27:41.184 --> 00:27:44.724
If a dangerous moment comes, tell me so I can go save you.

390
00:27:45.594 --> 00:27:46.625
Please.

391
00:27:48.025 --> 00:27:49.364
Come before it's too late.

392
00:27:49.695 --> 00:27:51.364
Tell me the time and place,

393
00:27:51.565 --> 00:27:55.164
so I know it in my dream.

394
00:27:57.474 --> 00:28:00.474
Sanggu-dong, Suju Building. It's the rooftop.

395
00:28:02.505 --> 00:28:04.014
It's April 11.

396
00:28:05.215 --> 00:28:06.715
10:12pm.

397
00:28:44.184 --> 00:28:46.054
Jung Jae Chan!

398
00:29:37.204 --> 00:29:38.235
Kang Dae Hee!

399
00:29:44.644 --> 00:29:47.514
You are under arrest for poisoning your brother to death.

400
00:29:51.114 --> 00:29:53.655
You falsified a car accident to cover this up.

401
00:29:54.655 --> 00:29:55.925
And claimed false insurances. You are under arrest.

402
00:30:31.094 --> 00:30:37.235
(While You Were Sleeping)
