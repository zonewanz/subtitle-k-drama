1
00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:08.158
Which is it?

2
00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:12.662
Don't torment me any longer, Mi Jung.

3
00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:14.598
Which girl is mine?

4
00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:17.868
Which is it?

5
00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:19.369
Which one is mine? Who is my daughter?

6
00:00:20.137 --> 00:00:22.639
It's Ji An!

7
00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:30.213
Is it Ji An?

8
00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:40.957
Is it...

9
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.694
really her?

10
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.400
Why didn't you...

11
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.370
report it?

12
00:00:56.273 --> 00:00:58.341
Why did you take Eun Seok 
in the first place?

13
00:00:58.542 --> 00:00:59.843
Her pictures were...

14
00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:02.479
on every newspaper 
and TV all over the country.

15
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.449
I thought she was abandoned.

16
00:01:13.623 --> 00:01:15.592
I always wanted a daughter.

17
00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:20.397
I was happy to have not just 1, but 2.

18
00:01:24.568 --> 00:01:25.969
Let's take a look here.

19
00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.537
- These hairpins are cute. - This one.

20
00:01:28.305 --> 00:01:29.940
They're so cute.

21
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.708
Which would you like, Ji An? This one?

22
00:01:31.808 --> 00:01:35.679
Okay. Get these two then. This is cute too.

23
00:01:36.947 --> 00:01:39.583
- What about this one? - Oh, no. Look out!

24
00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:47.424
It was all my fault.

25
00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:04.040
On the way back after burying her,

26
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:07.911
I saw a crying child.

27
00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:13.250
Oh, dear.

28
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.856
It felt like my daughter came back alive.

29
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:22.859
We found her...

30
00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.530
out of nowhere. We thought...

31
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:29.199
she was abandoned.

32
00:02:30.634 --> 00:02:33.470
I asked the police for any 
missing child reports,

33
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.172
but they said no.

34
00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.309
They were very similar 
in height and appearance.

35
00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:42.779
Two days later,

36
00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:46.183
we took her to Dubai with us.

37
00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:49.986
I couldn't possibly report her death,

38
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:53.823
so I prayed for her for 
three years in heart.

39
00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:00.830
I found that two days 
after Eun Seok's missing,

40
00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.533
on Friday, August 21, 1992,

41
00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:06.002
the whole family left for Dubai.

42
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:09.506
That's only an excuse.

43
00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:13.510
Eun Seok can't replace your dead daughter.

44
00:03:13.577 --> 00:03:16.379
How dare you consider her as a replacement?

45
00:03:16.513 --> 00:03:17.914
Then...

46
00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:21.518
why did you lose your child?

47
00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.187
How did she...

48
00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.690
end up there with so many bug bites?

49
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.893
I don't even know how long she starved.

50
00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:32.329
When I held her up,

51
00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.532
she hugged me while trembling.

52
00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.735
She fell asleep after only 
a few sips of tea.

53
00:03:40.237 --> 00:03:43.740
Why did you leave her in 
the mountain like that?

54
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.180
I didn't. Someone took her.

55
00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:53.817
By the way,

56
00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.288
how did you know it was us?

57
00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:07.063
Do you want me to tell her,

58
00:04:07.197 --> 00:04:08.665
or do you want to tell her?

59
00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:12.869
What?

60
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:14.404
Eun Seok will be shocked.

61
00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:17.140
It'd be better for you to tell her.

62
00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:19.909
Call my child immediately.

63
00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:22.545
Ms. No.

64
00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.881
I must see Eun Seok now,

65
00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:26.750
so call her and tell her yourself.

66
00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:31.187
Or do you want me to do it instead?

67
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:42.632
Who was it?

68
00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:44.801
It was her.

69
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.375
I knew it.

70
00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:54.244
Where are you going now?

71
00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:56.313
I must go see Eun Seok.

72
00:05:11.628 --> 00:05:13.496
I couldn't even flush.

73
00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:15.432
I tried my best to hold my breathe.

74
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.003
I didn't notice it at all.

75
00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:22.939
How could you keep it a secret from me?

76
00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.175
Hey, I only charged you...

77
00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:28.812
half the rent for this house.

78
00:05:28.812 --> 00:05:31.548
What are you doing here?

79
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.119
Oh, my. You look really shocked.

80
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.689
No wonder. It's possible.

81
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:43.860
By the way, what are you going to do now?

82
00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:46.730
She said she's going to take Ji An with her.

83
00:05:46.796 --> 00:05:49.499
No, wait. You should let her take her.

84
00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:51.768
She owns Haesung Corporation.

85
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:55.538
My goodness. Ji An suffered so much here...

86
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:58.174
when she had such rich parents?

87
00:05:58.174 --> 00:05:59.175
Please stop.

88
00:06:00.176 --> 00:06:01.378
My goodness.

89
00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.314
Then what about Tae Soo?

90
00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.417
- Tae Soo? - Your husband.

91
00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:11.121
He didn't show it at all.

92
00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:13.690
You only cared for Ji Soo, so he looked after Ji An.

93
00:06:13.757 --> 00:06:17.293
- He must've felt bad. - Please stop. Please.

94
00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.866
Please stop, and leave.

95
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.435
I want to be alone.

96
00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:28.238
You must decide what you're going to do.

97
00:06:28.538 --> 00:06:29.606
I'm not...

98
00:06:31.241 --> 00:06:32.542
myself.

99
00:06:33.176 --> 00:06:35.445
I don't even have the energy to talk.

100
00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:36.980
Please.

101
00:06:45.088 --> 00:06:47.490
Bread tastes the best during a break.

102
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.225
You must be happy.

103
00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:50.794
Bread isn't good enough.

104
00:06:50.794 --> 00:06:54.197
Ji An said she'll get a part time job.

105
00:06:54.898 --> 00:06:57.000
She won't listen.

106
00:06:57.133 --> 00:06:59.235
Tell her yourself.

107
00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.605
What are you doing?

108
00:07:06.743 --> 00:07:11.247
(Deposit)

109
00:07:13.817 --> 00:07:15.752
- Mr. Jung. - What?

110
00:07:15.752 --> 00:07:18.755
Can I borrow your phone? I left mine at home.

111
00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:20.690
You must eat this today.

112
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.292
- Thank you. Bye. - Bye.

113
00:07:29.165 --> 00:07:31.668
I'm sure I gave him the right number.

114
00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:38.741
Here's my number.

115
00:07:48.785 --> 00:07:49.853
Hold on.

116
00:07:56.993 --> 00:07:58.228
Hello?

117
00:08:01.698 --> 00:08:03.066
Hello?

118
00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:06.936
Isn't this Seo Ji Soo's phone?

119
00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:12.175
It is. This is she speaking.

120
00:08:12.809 --> 00:08:15.812
Goodness, I thought you were someone else.

121
00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:17.113
Dad?

122
00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:19.482
I'm calling you with someone else's phone.

123
00:08:19.549 --> 00:08:20.884
So answer my questions quickly.

124
00:08:20.984 --> 00:08:24.053
Where is the fried chicken restaurant Ji An works at?

125
00:08:25.555 --> 00:08:26.556
It's in Yeouido?

126
00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:31.494
This is my phone.

127
00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:36.432
Why do you look so down? Get ready to go home.

128
00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.503
I gave this guy my number, but he's not calling me.

129
00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:43.773
The bicycle guy doesn't like you, Ji Soo.

130
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.975
How did you know it was the guy on the bicycle?

131
00:08:46.242 --> 00:08:47.877
You chased after him so many times.

132
00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:51.648
That's how you knew.

133
00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:55.118
Did you say he doesn't like me?

134
00:08:55.652 --> 00:08:57.754
He might just not have time to call me...

135
00:08:57.754 --> 00:08:59.122
if he's really busy.

136
00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:02.525
Besides, he might feel shy about calling me.

137
00:09:02.525 --> 00:09:05.528
Guys don't delay when they want to call the ladies...

138
00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:07.630
as long as he's at least interested in that lady.

139
00:09:07.864 --> 00:09:09.098
Really?

140
00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:12.135
He will never call you. Don't wait for his call.

141
00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.604
How do you know that, Mr. Kang?

142
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.106
Put things away. Clean the hall.

143
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.608
Clean the front of the bakery.

144
00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:20.276
Yes, Mr. Kang.

145
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:27.784
If he doesn't call me, I won't have another chance.

146
00:09:30.887 --> 00:09:34.123
If it weren't for Ji An, I'd have confessed to him.

147
00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:48.638
Boss,

148
00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:51.341
if you keep that up, you'll ruin your business.

149
00:09:51.574 --> 00:09:54.477
Be friendly. Say, "Welcome" and "Goodbye".

150
00:09:54.477 --> 00:09:56.145
This is a prerequisite of running a business.

151
00:09:58.247 --> 00:09:59.983
Since there are no customers, give it a try.

152
00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:03.219
Since there are no customers,

153
00:10:03.219 --> 00:10:05.388
can't I talk to you casually?

154
00:10:05.755 --> 00:10:07.657
Why are you talking to me causally?

155
00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:12.996
Oh, right. The lady who gave you her number.

156
00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:15.331
She hung around the cafe today again.

157
00:10:15.398 --> 00:10:18.234
That doesn't concern me at all.

158
00:10:19.002 --> 00:10:21.137
She kept touching her phone.

159
00:10:21.237 --> 00:10:23.206
I think she was waiting for your call.

160
00:10:25.408 --> 00:10:27.610
Here's my number.

161
00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.213
Sorry.

162
00:10:37.987 --> 00:10:40.390
(Delete)

163
00:10:43.459 --> 00:10:46.129
She was quite pretty.

164
00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:47.463
Pretty?

165
00:10:47.463 --> 00:10:49.365
I hate girls who aren't straightforward.

166
00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:51.467
You know how many months she's been eyeing me?

167
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:53.569
No, how many months has it been?

168
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:55.271
She hid all over the place to look at me.

169
00:10:55.271 --> 00:10:57.774
She even chased after me. She frustrates me.

170
00:10:58.841 --> 00:11:00.610
I feel bad for her.

171
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.011
Woo Hee.

172
00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.481
Did your first love call you?

173
00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:09.585
No, she didn't. She's not texting me back.

174
00:11:09.986 --> 00:11:11.487
Her phone is turned off.

175
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.726
The number you have dialed is busy on another call...

176
00:11:16.726 --> 00:11:17.994
Her phone is turned on.

177
00:11:18.127 --> 00:11:19.729
Dad, what is it?

178
00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:20.763
Hey.

179
00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:24.267
I'm in Seoul now. I had to be at the headquarters.

180
00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.769
I'm in Yeouido.

181
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.105
Which restaurant do you work at?

182
00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:30.707
It's in Yeouido too.

183
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.709
Really? That's great.

184
00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:35.011
Let's grab dinner together then.

185
00:11:35.878 --> 00:11:37.747
Well...

186
00:11:37.747 --> 00:11:40.383
Hey, what are you doing? The orders are piling up.

187
00:11:40.383 --> 00:11:42.151
Dad, I'll call you again.

188
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:43.486
- Hey. - I'm sorry.

189
00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:45.855
A group of Chinese tourists just ordered.

190
00:11:45.855 --> 00:11:48.124
Cook 30 fried chickens in total. Hurry.

191
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.492
All right. I'm sorry.

192
00:11:49.492 --> 00:11:51.728
Hold on a minute. Let me see.

193
00:11:52.028 --> 00:11:53.863
What did I say about frying the second time?

194
00:12:28.698 --> 00:12:30.733
Mom, you're home early.

195
00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:32.769
Why are you heading out now?

196
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:36.639
The professor rescheduled my morning lesson.

197
00:12:37.907 --> 00:12:39.642
Stay focused, and practice.

198
00:12:39.742 --> 00:12:40.743
Okay.

199
00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.980
Have a good lesson.

200
00:12:53.322 --> 00:12:56.659
Why did Mom let her drive?

201
00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.427
Did something happen?

202
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.366
I guess I should postpone my trip today.

203
00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:04.901
I have a bad feeling about this.

204
00:13:05.735 --> 00:13:07.003
Goodbye.

205
00:13:07.003 --> 00:13:08.004
Bye.

206
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.991
- Sir. - What?

207
00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:31.127
How much are these with my employee discount?

208
00:13:31.127 --> 00:13:32.361
Goodness.

209
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:35.231
You just explained to the customer that...

210
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.633
they're the newest arrival. Stop dreaming.

211
00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:39.001
Employee discount, my foot.

212
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:41.571
Then do I have to pay the full price?

213
00:13:41.604 --> 00:13:44.373
You're such a scrooge. Why do you want them?

214
00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:47.476
What is it? Did you get a girlfriend?

215
00:13:47.476 --> 00:13:51.080
No, I won't date until I accomplish my mission.

216
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.114
Whatever.

217
00:13:53.482 --> 00:13:54.750
They are for my oldest sister.

218
00:13:56.118 --> 00:13:57.153
Really?

219
00:13:57.987 --> 00:13:59.488
In that case,

220
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.359
you can use your employee discount for these.

221
00:14:03.359 --> 00:14:04.594
What do you think?

222
00:14:05.127 --> 00:14:06.229
Sure.

223
00:14:47.403 --> 00:14:49.205
Empty this room.

224
00:14:55.912 --> 00:14:56.913
- Yong Min. - Yes?

225
00:14:56.913 --> 00:14:58.481
- Help her. - Sure.

226
00:15:04.754 --> 00:15:07.089
(General Manager Min)

227
00:15:09.525 --> 00:15:10.626
What is it?

228
00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:14.530
Ms. No wants you to come home early today.

229
00:15:15.398 --> 00:15:18.234
General Manager Min, don't you know where I am now?

230
00:15:18.401 --> 00:15:20.770
Ms. No has an important matter to discuss.

231
00:15:21.237 --> 00:15:23.406
What is it? Why don't you tell me?

232
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.875
Me?

233
00:15:27.243 --> 00:15:28.911
She asked you to call me.

234
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:30.880
Doesn't it imply you're allowed to tell me that?

235
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.149
This is very important.

236
00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:35.084
My plans are important as well.

237
00:15:35.818 --> 00:15:38.387
I'm going to sleep here. We'll discuss it tomorrow.

238
00:15:38.587 --> 00:15:39.822
Whatever that important matter is.

239
00:15:43.492 --> 00:15:46.662
I thought you were going to leave after dinner.

240
00:15:46.862 --> 00:15:49.498
I'm planning to cut weeds on my parents' graves.

241
00:15:50.232 --> 00:15:51.233
Let's go.

242
00:15:53.135 --> 00:15:55.371
Tomorrow? He's returning tomorrow?

243
00:15:55.438 --> 00:15:57.873
You didn't go to his uncle's memorial service.

244
00:15:57.873 --> 00:15:59.475
I think he's a bit upset.

245
00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:02.979
I think it'd be better if you called him.

246
00:16:02.979 --> 00:16:04.246
Let him be.

247
00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:10.953
Dad.

248
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.622
Hey, Ji An.

249
00:16:13.656 --> 00:16:15.358
You should've waited inside.

250
00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.126
Hey, aren't you hungry?

251
00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:19.628
I used to come here often when I ran my business.

252
00:16:19.628 --> 00:16:21.230
It's still here.

253
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.199
The meat here is the best.

254
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.502
Dad, I know you don't have much money to afford this.

255
00:16:26.502 --> 00:16:27.903
Korean beef is expensive.

256
00:16:28.104 --> 00:16:29.905
I have money. Don't worry.

257
00:16:29.972 --> 00:16:31.340
Let's go in. Come on.

258
00:16:31.907 --> 00:16:33.142
Let's go somewhere else.

259
00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:34.910
- Let's go somewhere else. - Where?

260
00:16:40.883 --> 00:16:42.218
Lost your appetite?

261
00:16:42.818 --> 00:16:45.521
Why can't you eat? Can't you really eat?

262
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.491
Didn't I tell you we should have Korean beef?

263
00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:50.993
No, this is tasty too.

264
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.362
They are all the same once they are in my stomach.

265
00:16:53.362 --> 00:16:54.997
They only stay in my mouth for 10 seconds.

266
00:16:54.997 --> 00:16:56.899
I won't eat beef for the sake of 10 seconds.

267
00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:10.112
Hey, open your mouth.

268
00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:12.014
Give it to me. I can eat on my own.

269
00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:23.926
This is so tasty.

270
00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:33.903
I learned from experience that...

271
00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:37.940
there's a time for everything,

272
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.942
and that destiny needs to play a part.

273
00:17:41.377 --> 00:17:42.545
I know.

274
00:17:44.013 --> 00:17:46.315
Let's just think...

275
00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:48.284
that it's not...

276
00:17:48.384 --> 00:17:49.885
your time yet.

277
00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:51.887
I will.

278
00:17:52.121 --> 00:17:54.657
I'm not the only one who didn't get the job.

279
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.527
And I want you...

280
00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:01.097
to quit the part-time job.

281
00:18:01.363 --> 00:18:02.898
Take a trip somewhere with this money.

282
00:18:07.536 --> 00:18:11.607
There's a saying, "Make hay while the sun shines."

283
00:18:11.907 --> 00:18:13.609
It's a good chance to recharge your batteries.

284
00:18:13.609 --> 00:18:16.679
No, it's okay. You don't have money for that.

285
00:18:16.912 --> 00:18:18.047
I got a bonus.

286
00:18:18.047 --> 00:18:20.382
Your mom doesn't know I have the money. Take it.

287
00:18:21.584 --> 00:18:22.685
Give it to Mom.

288
00:18:23.719 --> 00:18:26.288
I'm too old to get money from you.

289
00:18:26.622 --> 00:18:29.625
I already started standing on my own feet long ago.

290
00:18:30.459 --> 00:18:31.527
Hey.

291
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:35.431
That doesn't mean I can't give you some money.

292
00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.968
I'll just accept your heart.

293
00:18:43.606 --> 00:18:45.508
Mom would be upset...

294
00:18:45.508 --> 00:18:47.343
if she knew we ate meat without her.

295
00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:49.011
This is good.

296
00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:52.548
Mom prefers money over meat, right?

297
00:18:56.085 --> 00:18:58.888
I can't go home. I should go to Daejeon tonight.

298
00:19:00.055 --> 00:19:01.857
- Tonight? - So...

299
00:19:01.857 --> 00:19:04.760
don't tell Mom I was here.

300
00:19:05.261 --> 00:19:07.830
She'd get upset if she found out I only met you.

301
00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.066
Did you...

302
00:19:11.634 --> 00:19:13.636
come here because of me?

303
00:19:16.972 --> 00:19:20.209
Why did you do that wasting bus fares?

304
00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:27.683
By the way,

305
00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:30.586
why are you using the honorific form?

306
00:19:32.121 --> 00:19:33.122
What?

307
00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:36.892
Since when did you start using the honorific form?

308
00:19:39.028 --> 00:19:42.331
It's just because I'm a big girl now.

309
00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:54.176
Have some more. You should go back to Daejeon early.

310
00:19:56.078 --> 00:19:57.780
Don't worry about me.

311
00:19:58.113 --> 00:20:00.182
I'll figure things out.

312
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.021
Have some more.

313
00:20:07.556 --> 00:20:10.426
Okay. Let's eat.

314
00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:18.067
Dad, have a safe trip back to Daejeon.

315
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.902
Okay. Just go home.

316
00:20:20.069 --> 00:20:21.737
I want to see you off.

317
00:20:24.106 --> 00:20:26.375
Make sure not to skip meals.

318
00:20:26.609 --> 00:20:29.078
If you want to take a rest from work, just tell me.

319
00:20:29.078 --> 00:20:30.279
I have money.

320
00:20:30.679 --> 00:20:31.880
Okay.

321
00:20:35.451 --> 00:20:36.585
I'll see you later.

322
00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:37.820
Bye.

323
00:21:16.792 --> 00:21:18.327
Go on.

324
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.101
Bye.

325
00:21:59.635 --> 00:22:00.936
Ji An.

326
00:22:03.372 --> 00:22:05.341
Why are you waiting for me?

327
00:22:05.374 --> 00:22:06.775
I had something to ask.

328
00:22:06.942 --> 00:22:08.477
Let's go. I'll buy you some beer.

329
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:10.512
It's okay. I'll go home.

330
00:22:10.713 --> 00:22:13.182
Don't you want some beer? It's on me.

331
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:16.585
Save the money, and give it to Mom.

332
00:22:17.319 --> 00:22:20.022
Earlier today, Mr. Kang told me...

333
00:22:20.022 --> 00:22:22.658
Mr. Sun doesn't call me because he hates me.

334
00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:25.928
We didn't even date. Why would he hate me?

335
00:22:26.362 --> 00:22:28.997
Maybe he hates you or maybe not.

336
00:22:29.298 --> 00:22:31.967
Hey, how could you say that to me?

337
00:22:32.067 --> 00:22:33.936
If he doesn't call me, I'm finished.

338
00:22:34.169 --> 00:22:37.139
I don't even know where he is now.

339
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.675
Why don't you know that?

340
00:22:40.676 --> 00:22:42.811
I'll go to the cafe and ask where he is.

341
00:22:42.878 --> 00:22:44.213
Where's the cafe?

342
00:22:44.213 --> 00:22:46.115
Why are you getting mad?

343
00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:48.717
I told you I'd go to the cafe...

344
00:22:49.685 --> 00:22:53.122
and ask where Mr. Sun works.

345
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.358
So please...

346
00:22:56.925 --> 00:22:59.228
Can't you wait just a few days?

347
00:22:59.828 --> 00:23:01.764
Let me just catch my breath.

348
00:23:01.897 --> 00:23:05.033
Give me some time to pull myself together, okay?

349
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.369
Okay.

350
00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:16.445
- She's fired? - Yes, she's fired.

351
00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.849
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

352
00:23:21.617 --> 00:23:24.219
You're right. What should we do now?

353
00:23:25.187 --> 00:23:27.823
What do you mean by "we"?

354
00:23:27.856 --> 00:23:30.392
I'm the victim, and you're the offender's family.

355
00:23:30.626 --> 00:23:33.829
If my sister finds out I pretended to be her,

356
00:23:33.862 --> 00:23:36.098
I'll be beaten to death by her.

357
00:23:36.398 --> 00:23:38.867
Now that we both are involved in this,

358
00:23:38.967 --> 00:23:40.869
I guess I can say "we".

359
00:23:41.637 --> 00:23:44.306
- That's it. - I have an idea.

360
00:23:44.306 --> 00:23:47.309
I got a job. I'll pay you after I get paid.

361
00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:50.612
Do you think your sister, who'd beat you to death,

362
00:23:50.813 --> 00:23:52.047
will let it go?

363
00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:54.616
Oh. I don't think so.

364
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.151
Then we're done talking.

365
00:23:56.919 --> 00:23:59.621
I'll take care of it with your sister.

366
00:24:00.155 --> 00:24:01.890
You should just stay out of this.

367
00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:04.126
How will you take care of it?

368
00:24:07.162 --> 00:24:09.097
I'll do it like an adult.

369
00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:10.833
Okay?

370
00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:15.671
Maybe he said he wouldn't let it go.

371
00:24:21.276 --> 00:24:23.312
Mom, it's time for the drama. What are you doing?

372
00:24:24.446 --> 00:24:25.447
Mom.

373
00:24:26.281 --> 00:24:28.150
What? Hi.

374
00:24:29.051 --> 00:24:30.519
You two came home together.

375
00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:33.422
Yes. We met on the way home. Are you sleepy?

376
00:24:33.422 --> 00:24:34.857
- Yes. - I'm home.

377
00:24:34.857 --> 00:24:37.125
Ji Soo, go take a shower.

378
00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:39.561
- Ji An, come in here. - Okay.

379
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:48.971
What's the matter?

380
00:24:50.372 --> 00:24:51.640
Ji An.

381
00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:56.111
I want you to quit your part-time job tomorrow.

382
00:24:57.112 --> 00:24:58.614
Quit my part-time job?

383
00:24:58.881 --> 00:25:02.918
You spend all day in front of boiling oil in summer.

384
00:25:03.385 --> 00:25:06.288
Your face is flushed red.

385
00:25:06.922 --> 00:25:09.191
That's why the money is good.

386
00:25:09.691 --> 00:25:11.193
I want you to quit anyway.

387
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.165
Use this as your pocket money.

388
00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:22.471
Why are you doing this to me?

389
00:25:23.906 --> 00:25:26.575
The job market is unsteady in summer.

390
00:25:26.575 --> 00:25:28.610
I'll apply for jobs in fall again.

391
00:25:28.844 --> 00:25:30.612
Then take some time off until fall.

392
00:25:30.712 --> 00:25:33.115
I'll take care of it myself.

393
00:25:33.215 --> 00:25:35.918
I'm doing it because I can do it, and I should do it.

394
00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:37.886
Do you have a bone to pick with me?

395
00:25:38.887 --> 00:25:40.188
What do you mean?

396
00:25:40.188 --> 00:25:43.659
You come home reeking of fried chicken every night.

397
00:25:43.659 --> 00:25:45.527
You look exhausted.

398
00:25:45.527 --> 00:25:47.763
You're the one who has a bone to pick with me.

399
00:25:47.763 --> 00:25:51.266
Just quit the chicken restaurant. Is it hard?

400
00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:54.870
It's hard.

401
00:25:56.438 --> 00:25:59.708
I know how our family gets by every month.

402
00:26:00.943 --> 00:26:03.345
I haven't finished paying my student loans yet.

403
00:26:03.612 --> 00:26:07.349
I don't even know when I'll be employed.

404
00:26:07.583 --> 00:26:09.051
I just can't quit.

405
00:26:11.086 --> 00:26:12.621
Just keep this money.

406
00:26:13.088 --> 00:26:15.290
I won't be able to pay my living expenses a while.

407
00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:16.525
Please understand that.

408
00:26:32.107 --> 00:26:34.376
Gosh, it looks good.

409
00:26:34.776 --> 00:26:36.578
Give me the key. I'll say hello to the car.

410
00:26:36.878 --> 00:26:39.348
What do you want me to do with the car accident?

411
00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:42.618
I'll wait a few more days. I believe she'll call me.

412
00:26:42.818 --> 00:26:44.553
I'll have her send the money to my account.

413
00:26:44.553 --> 00:26:46.355
No. Just tell her to come to my office.

414
00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:51.927
Mr. Choi.

415
00:26:52.628 --> 00:26:53.629
What?

416
00:26:53.629 --> 00:26:55.897
Do you want me to bring her to your office?

417
00:26:56.565 --> 00:26:59.201
Then do you want me to tell her on the phone...

418
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:01.069
that I won't take the 5,000 dollars?

419
00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.405
Why would you let it go like that?

420
00:27:03.405 --> 00:27:05.407
She looks so miserable.

421
00:27:05.407 --> 00:27:07.376
She just got fired and has no money.

422
00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:11.046
Then why would you see her in your office?

423
00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:13.548
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

424
00:27:14.016 --> 00:27:16.018
I'm not giving alms. I'm just being considerate.

425
00:27:16.118 --> 00:27:17.552
I should go through due formalities.

426
00:27:22.157 --> 00:27:23.525
Do you want me to quit?

427
00:27:24.626 --> 00:27:27.029
You said nothing when I got off work yesterday.

428
00:27:27.195 --> 00:27:29.931
My nephew wants to work here.

429
00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:33.802
You can't just fire me like this though.

430
00:27:34.036 --> 00:27:36.872
You're supposed to give at least three days' notice.

431
00:27:37.372 --> 00:27:40.075
You should give me some time to find a new job.

432
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:45.180
That's why I want to pay you for another week.

433
00:27:46.548 --> 00:27:47.883
For a week?

434
00:27:52.721 --> 00:27:54.423
Thanks for all of your hard work.

435
00:27:54.623 --> 00:27:57.359
I felt bad that I made you work so hard.

436
00:27:59.528 --> 00:28:00.529
Hang on, please.

437
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.598
I'll give you half of this back.

438
00:28:11.907 --> 00:28:14.142
Make Seo Ji An quit.

439
00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:23.919
Who are you? Why are you so disrespectful to me?

440
00:28:24.986 --> 00:28:28.023
How can I not be rude if you are to my daughter?

441
00:28:28.857 --> 00:28:30.358
Oh, she's your daughter?

442
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.528
Give this to her.

443
00:28:34.863 --> 00:28:35.864
Sure.

444
00:28:40.068 --> 00:28:41.269
Bye.

445

(Nara Department Store is hiring event helpers.)

446

Hello, I'm calling for...

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.652
the part-time job you have posted.

(Part-time event helper, no experience required)

Sure, I'll be there by 11am with my resume.

450
00:29:02.524 --> 00:29:03.692
Thank you.

(Yoon Ha Jung)

455
00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:32.521
Why are you calling, Ha Jung?

456
00:29:32.554 --> 00:29:34.022
Why am I calling?

457
00:29:34.456 --> 00:29:36.892
Because of my hospital bill and settlement money.

458
00:29:37.192 --> 00:29:39.127
You said you'd pay me with your severance pay.

459
00:29:39.127 --> 00:29:41.897
I haven't gotten my severance pay yet.

460
00:29:41.897 --> 00:29:44.566
That's obviously why I haven't paid you yet.

461
00:29:45.867 --> 00:29:47.936
The settlement money is only 5,000 dollars.

462
00:29:47.936 --> 00:29:49.437
Were you worried that I wouldn't give it to you?

463
00:29:50.305 --> 00:29:52.707
5,000 dollars is fine, but you have 3 days.

464
00:29:54.543 --> 00:29:56.711
That's all you'll take?

465

Let's consider this my noblesse oblige,

466

00:30:02.284 --> 00:30:06.087
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

468
00:30:06.388 --> 00:30:09.357
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

469
00:30:09.357 --> 00:30:11.593
You can thank me after fulfilling your promise.

470
00:30:12.427 --> 00:30:13.528
Write down this phone number.

471

Hey, Ji An. Why aren't you answering me?

I'll call you back later.

Thank you.

478
00:31:33.608 --> 00:31:35.777
Mr. Kim, your friend is a businessman?

479
00:31:35.777 --> 00:31:37.145
Are you sure he's not an athlete?

480
00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:38.380
I told you.

481
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.382
He's an extreme sports nut.

482
00:31:40.382 --> 00:31:43.685
He loves to go skydiving, windsurfing,

483
00:31:43.785 --> 00:31:45.387
skiing, and snowboarding.

484
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.688
Hey, what other sports do you play?

485
00:31:46.688 --> 00:31:48.056
Don't overreact.

486
00:31:48.189 --> 00:31:49.824
I like exciting sports.

487
00:31:49.958 --> 00:31:51.860
Then come to Australia with Mr. Kim.

488
00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.361
We'll go skydiving in Cairns.

489
00:31:53.361 --> 00:31:54.362
Okay.

490
00:32:00.702 --> 00:32:03.438
Do Kyung, the deal will go well, thanks to you.

491
00:32:04.139 --> 00:32:06.207
Gosh, that guy is very fussy.

492
00:32:06.308 --> 00:32:07.909
But he's totally opened up to you.

493
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:09.377
Don't let your guard down.

494
00:32:09.377 --> 00:32:11.813
The KSP Group isn't an easy investment company.

495
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.049
Okay.

496
00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.721
Here you go.

497
00:32:25.794 --> 00:32:27.629
If you get my number,

498
00:32:27.762 --> 00:32:29.130
shall I marry you?

499
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.941
That would be a punishment.

00:32:39.941 --> 00:32:41.376
We decided not to get wed.

501
00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:42.410
Gosh.

502
00:32:44.079 --> 00:32:45.547
- Goodbye. - Bye.

503
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:56.458
Hey, Ji An.

504
00:32:57.125 --> 00:32:59.361
What brings you here? You didn't even call me.

505
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:01.296
I was just passing by...

506
00:33:01.296 --> 00:33:03.798
and thought of something I wanted to ask you.

507
00:33:04.265 --> 00:33:05.467
What is it?

508
00:33:07.902 --> 00:33:12.107
Can you borrow more money through the employee loan?

509
00:33:14.542 --> 00:33:17.112
Hey, it's already maxed out, you know.

510
00:33:17.445 --> 00:33:19.147
It hit the limit when our rent deposit went up.

511
00:33:19.581 --> 00:33:21.716
Oh, right. I forgot about that.

512
00:33:23.952 --> 00:33:26.521
I wanted to ask because I wanted an emergency fund.

513
00:33:26.521 --> 00:33:27.856
I'm off. I'll see you later.

514
00:33:33.628 --> 00:33:34.629
Who's that girl?

515
00:33:35.263 --> 00:33:36.331
What?

516
00:33:37.132 --> 00:33:39.267
She's my sister. The elder one of the two.

517
00:33:45.507 --> 00:33:47.175
- That was fun, mate. - Good.

518
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.614
Those jerks.

519
00:33:52.647 --> 00:33:54.382
It would've been perfect to shower together...

520
00:33:54.382 --> 00:33:55.784
and decide to invest in Sungho Medical.

521
00:33:55.917 --> 00:33:57.619
Why don't you go see a shaman or something?

522
00:33:57.852 --> 00:33:59.387
I'm so desperate.

523
00:33:59.387 --> 00:34:01.022
I told you my dad said he'd bring in...

524
00:34:01.022 --> 00:34:03.058
a management specialist if I don't prove myself.

525
00:34:03.625 --> 00:34:04.826
Mr. Choi.

526
00:34:05.627 --> 00:34:06.628
Yes.

527
00:34:06.961 --> 00:34:09.330
The interpreter fell and sprained her foot,

528
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.331
so she's at the hospital.

529
00:34:10.365 --> 00:34:12.967
What should we do? We can't hire someone new.

530
00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:15.336
Why don't you have one of them do it?

531
00:34:15.437 --> 00:34:17.472
We can't. They only have serving experience.

532
00:34:18.573 --> 00:34:20.508
Gosh, what should we do?

533
00:34:25.513 --> 00:34:26.781
(Assailant)

534
00:34:31.052 --> 00:34:32.087
Hello?

535
00:34:32.387 --> 00:34:33.888
Hello, how are you?

536
00:34:33.888 --> 00:34:35.457
I'm the driver that caused...

537
00:34:35.457 --> 00:34:37.092
the accident the other day.

538
00:34:37.392 --> 00:34:40.361
Your secretary gave me your number.

539
00:34:40.795 --> 00:34:43.198
- You remember me, right? - I haven't been well,

540
00:34:43.198 --> 00:34:45.567
and it was nine days ago, not "the other day".

541
00:34:45.567 --> 00:34:48.436
You're calling me six days late.

542
00:34:48.436 --> 00:34:49.971
Of course I remember you.

543
00:34:50.472 --> 00:34:54.075
I'm really sorry. I was in a bit of a situation.

544
00:34:54.242 --> 00:34:56.111
That's why I couldn't keep my promise. I'm sorry.

545
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:57.345
What about the 5,000 dollars?

546
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.448
That's...

547
00:35:00.548 --> 00:35:02.517
Tell me which departments you have worked in.

548
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.718
Hurry up. It's urgent.

549
00:35:04.953 --> 00:35:07.889
The marketing and sales team in Global Business.

550
00:35:07.956 --> 00:35:10.492
You must speak English. Can you speak Japanese?

551
00:35:12.494 --> 00:35:13.628
Okay, that's all I need to know.

552
00:35:14.395 --> 00:35:16.498
Put on a suit, and come to Yangpyeong right away.

553
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:18.133
I'll give you the highest pay.

554
00:35:19.267 --> 00:35:20.802
Okay.

555
00:35:21.636 --> 00:35:22.704
I'm back.

556
00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:24.239
Sure, I'll call you again.

557
00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:25.640
Hey, Ji An!

558
00:35:29.477 --> 00:35:32.046
Ji An, I have something to tell you.

559
00:35:32.046 --> 00:35:33.515
Not now. Tell me later.

560
00:35:33.781 --> 00:35:34.782
Where are you going?

561
00:35:34.782 --> 00:35:36.050
I got a part-time gig.

562
00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:37.552
You don't need to work part-time jobs.

563
00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:39.888
I have to go. The pay is high.

564
00:35:41.856 --> 00:35:43.892
- There's no need. - See you later, Mom!

565
00:35:43.892 --> 00:35:46.361
Wait, Ji An. Let's talk for a minute!

566
00:35:46.361 --> 00:35:47.495
Ji An!

567
00:35:48.163 --> 00:35:49.697
My goodness.

568
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.266
Don't they belong in Eun Seok's room?

569
00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:01.536
Did you have to stay there overnight?

570
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.806
I told you that it's about something important.

571
00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:07.909
I wanted to visit my parents' graves.

572
00:37:07.909 --> 00:37:10.111
I told you I had to talk to you about something.

573
00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:11.246
Do I say that often?

574
00:37:11.246 --> 00:37:13.248
My uncle paid my tuition fees in place of my dad,

575
00:37:13.248 --> 00:37:16.517
and it was his 49th day funeral ceremony.

576
00:37:16.951 --> 00:37:18.586
What can be more important than that?

577
00:37:19.954 --> 00:37:21.089
Eun Seok.

578
00:37:21.756 --> 00:37:22.824
What?

579
00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:24.158
Our daughter, Eun Seok.

580
00:37:25.326 --> 00:37:26.761
I found her.

581
00:37:28.796 --> 00:37:30.698
What... What are you talking about?

582
00:37:32.567 --> 00:37:34.569
What do you mean? You found Eun Seok?

583
00:37:37.305 --> 00:37:38.506
Eun Seok is...

584
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.642
She was alive?

585
00:37:42.644 --> 00:37:43.878
She's alive?

586
00:37:44.779 --> 00:37:47.815
You ran DNA tests and met the woman who raised her?

587
00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:50.585
Yes.

588
00:37:51.386 --> 00:37:52.587
You did all that...

589
00:37:53.488 --> 00:37:56.491
on your own without so much as a hint to me?

590
00:37:57.392 --> 00:37:58.760
Don't you remember?

591
00:37:59.027 --> 00:38:01.362
Exactly a year after Eun Seok disappeared,

592
00:38:01.763 --> 00:38:04.132
you said we should stop since we'd never find her.

593
00:38:05.566 --> 00:38:07.468
You said she'd be dead.

594
00:38:07.468 --> 00:38:09.737
"Why would a rich girl be taken without a ransom?"

595
00:38:09.737 --> 00:38:11.239
Okay, that's enough.

596
00:38:13.341 --> 00:38:15.376
She's alive and we found her, so it's fine.

597
00:38:16.277 --> 00:38:17.645
Let's talk about Eun Seok.

598
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:19.847
How is she doing?

599
00:38:20.515 --> 00:38:21.916
What does she do?

600
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.553
She'll be 28. Is she doing well?

601
00:38:27.889 --> 00:38:29.657
I'm not fluent in Japanese,

602
00:38:29.657 --> 00:38:31.392
but I can read a script.

603
00:38:31.993 --> 00:38:35.196
Yes, I introduced products at a promotional event.

604
00:38:36.297 --> 00:38:38.132
Okay, sure.

605
00:38:39.801 --> 00:38:42.236
What does he want me to do at a trunk show?

606
00:38:43.971 --> 00:38:45.406
(38 dollars)

607
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.742
Don't take the bus. Take the cab.

608
00:38:47.775 --> 00:38:48.876
I'll pay the fare.

609
00:38:53.014 --> 00:38:55.316
How much further do we have to go?

610
00:38:56.951 --> 00:38:59.487
I only have 43 dollars.

611
00:39:00.088 --> 00:39:01.989
Don't you want to see her?

612
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.592
We waited for 25 years.

613
00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:07.028
Can't we wait a few more days or weeks?

614
00:39:07.028 --> 00:39:08.863
Because I found her after 25 years.

615
00:39:08.863 --> 00:39:10.131
So I don't want her...

616
00:39:10.531 --> 00:39:12.567
to spend another hour, not even a day in that house.

617
00:39:13.801 --> 00:39:14.969
It's not just about us.

618
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:17.305
We must consider her too.

619
00:39:17.839 --> 00:39:20.842
How can you say that after hearing how she's living?

620
00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:27.782
You're home, Seo Hyun.

621
00:39:28.216 --> 00:39:30.551
What are they talking about?

622
00:39:30.685 --> 00:39:32.120
Who is Eun Seok?

623
00:39:32.453 --> 00:39:34.655
Your older sister.

624
00:39:43.431 --> 00:39:45.133
Ask for Mr. Choi.

625
00:39:50.838 --> 00:39:53.007
Is he ashamed of his name or something?

626
00:39:53.007 --> 00:39:54.475
Why is he Mr. Choi?

627
00:39:58.146 --> 00:39:59.280
Ms. Jung.

628
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.449
- Hello. - You made it.

629
00:40:02.049 --> 00:40:04.385
I'm really sorry for not calling.

630
00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:06.087
I know about that.

631
00:40:06.888 --> 00:40:08.089
Give it to her.

632
00:40:08.322 --> 00:40:10.458
I'm Jung Hye Mi, a luxury goods shopper.

633
00:40:10.892 --> 00:40:12.427
I'm Seo Ji An.

634
00:40:12.493 --> 00:40:14.028
That's the script for the trunk show.

635
00:40:14.195 --> 00:40:15.396
Ms. Jung will speak.

636
00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:17.698
You will translate that into English and Japanese.

637
00:40:18.366 --> 00:40:19.801
Have you given a presentation?

638
00:40:20.134 --> 00:40:22.136
- Of course. - I would call anyone...

639
00:40:22.136 --> 00:40:23.938
if it were just a presentation.

640
00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:26.974
I'll go with a translation that fits what she says.

641
00:40:28.676 --> 00:40:30.178
I'll pay after the event.

642
00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:32.914
- When will you be done? - Before midnight.

643
00:40:33.247 --> 00:40:34.415
Wait.

644
00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:37.718
Could you pay me when I'm done?

645
00:40:39.787 --> 00:40:41.989
Why should I leave during a party...

646
00:40:41.989 --> 00:40:44.025
just to pay someone like you?

647
00:40:45.526 --> 00:40:47.495
I can't miss the last bus to Seoul.

648
00:40:47.929 --> 00:40:50.598
I'll give you the cab fare too, so wait.

649
00:40:51.032 --> 00:40:53.568
Let's not meet like this ever again and end this.

650
00:40:53.634 --> 00:40:55.236
I want to end it today.

651
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:58.840
Okay, I'll wait.

652
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.741
Go, and read the script.

653
00:41:01.142 --> 00:41:02.176
Okay.

654
00:41:20.027 --> 00:41:22.697
Don't get it scratched. It costs over 80,000.

655
00:41:23.498 --> 00:41:24.966
80,000 dollars?

656
00:41:25.299 --> 00:41:27.168
- Take the brochures. - Okay.

657
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:31.239
Are you done?

658
00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:32.907
Yes.

659
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.679
This is quite elaborate for a trunk show.

660
00:41:38.946 --> 00:41:41.916
We aren't the hosts. It's N-Gaon's gathering,

661
00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:43.317
and we got invited.

662
00:41:43.518 --> 00:41:46.087
They meet every quarter to play sports and chat.

663
00:41:46.487 --> 00:41:49.056
But what is N-Gaon?

664
00:41:49.991 --> 00:41:51.626
A gathering of third- generation chaebols...

665
00:41:51.626 --> 00:41:53.327
who were childhood friends.

666
00:41:54.662 --> 00:41:56.197
Third-generation chaebols?

667
00:41:59.867 --> 00:42:01.969
Hello, N-Gaon members.

668
00:42:01.969 --> 00:42:04.472
I'm a shopper from Hemilia, Jung Hye Mi.

669
00:42:04.572 --> 00:42:07.742
Thank you for inviting me again after last spring.

670
00:42:08.409 --> 00:42:10.077
Good evening, N-Gaon members.

671
00:42:10.077 --> 00:42:12.280
This is Jung Hye Mi. She's a personal shopper...

672
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.215
at the Hemilia Luxury Goods Store.

673
00:42:14.315 --> 00:42:16.183
It's a great honor to be here again...

674
00:42:16.183 --> 00:42:17.318
after last spring.

675
00:42:30.698 --> 00:42:32.567
Who's she? She speaks Japanese too?

676
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:37.138
Hiroshi's from Japan and represents KSP Group Asia.

677
00:42:37.572 --> 00:42:39.407
And English is essential for business.

678
00:42:40.207 --> 00:42:42.176
I'm sure he prefers Japanese in his down time.

679
00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:43.844
You're the best.

680
00:42:45.279 --> 00:42:49.116
Valentino's concept is "Classics are Forever".

681
00:42:49.116 --> 00:42:51.586
Witro offers clothes that challenge your daily life.

682
00:42:51.586 --> 00:42:54.322
Please view our suits from two contrasting lines.

683
00:42:54.755 --> 00:42:56.090
Here, you're watching...

684
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.926
two different styles of suits for this autumn.

685
00:42:58.993 --> 00:43:01.696
Valentino's theme is "Classic is Eternal"...

686
00:43:01.696 --> 00:43:04.565
and Witro's is "Defiance in Daily Life".

687
00:43:16.911 --> 00:43:20.047
The Valentino suits are paired with shirts...

688
00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.054
Business suits,

689
00:43:27.054 --> 00:43:28.889
or a date with an unfamiliar lady.

690
00:43:28.889 --> 00:43:30.157
(Seo Hyun)

691
00:43:34.895 --> 00:43:37.198
Where would you like to go with this fabulous...

692
00:43:37.198 --> 00:43:38.199
and classic style?

693
00:43:38.532 --> 00:43:40.468
What? What did you just say?

694
00:43:40.968 --> 00:43:42.336
Did you say Eun Seok?

695
00:43:42.837 --> 00:43:44.138
They found Eun Seok?

696
00:43:44.405 --> 00:43:46.507
Yes, but Mom and Dad are arguing.

697
00:43:46.507 --> 00:43:47.742
You need to come home now.

698
00:43:48.009 --> 00:43:49.243
Okay.

699
00:43:51.412 --> 00:43:52.446
Do Kyung.

700
00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.916
Did you hire a trilingual MC for me?

701
00:43:55.916 --> 00:43:57.818
Something came up at home.

702
00:43:57.952 --> 00:44:00.554
Tell the others, and wrap things up for me.

703
00:44:00.554 --> 00:44:01.856
Sure.

704
00:44:02.757 --> 00:44:04.358
Mom fainted again.

705
00:44:04.759 --> 00:44:07.228
Why are they fighting when they found their daughter?

706
00:44:07.928 --> 00:44:10.531
This is the end of what we prepared today.

707
00:44:10.531 --> 00:44:13.367
Please enjoy the rest of your stay. Thank you.

708
00:44:32.453 --> 00:44:34.321
Mom, are you okay?

709
00:44:34.488 --> 00:44:35.890
Did Doctor Kang come by?

710
00:44:37.258 --> 00:44:39.427
It's not the first time I fainted.

711
00:44:40.127 --> 00:44:41.762
Weren't you with N-Gaon?

712
00:44:41.929 --> 00:44:44.965
It's your turn. The host shouldn't leave the party.

713
00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:48.235
What do you mean you found Eun Seok?

714
00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:51.138
Did you really find her?

715
00:44:52.006 --> 00:44:54.575
Yes, we found her.

716
00:44:55.643 --> 00:44:57.344
She was alive?

717
00:44:58.379 --> 00:45:00.915
When and how did you find her?

718
00:45:01.015 --> 00:45:02.616
Let's talk later.

719
00:45:02.917 --> 00:45:04.218
It's a long story.

720
00:45:05.686 --> 00:45:08.055
Is she doing well?

721
00:45:08.489 --> 00:45:10.591
Whether or not she is,

722
00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:12.493
we'll have her tell us.

723
00:45:19.867 --> 00:45:22.837
When do we get to eat?

724
00:45:22.837 --> 00:45:24.905
Back at the hotel after the event.

725
00:45:26.006 --> 00:45:28.008
Do you not eat until then?

726
00:45:28.242 --> 00:45:30.411
We had a snack at 4pm.

727
00:45:37.451 --> 00:45:38.619
Eat this.

728
00:45:40.187 --> 00:45:42.389
Thank you so much.

729
00:45:45.526 --> 00:45:46.861
You can't eat here.

730
00:45:47.428 --> 00:45:48.929
Eat in secret.

731
00:45:56.337 --> 00:45:57.638
What happened?

732
00:45:58.139 --> 00:45:59.473
How did they find her?

733
00:46:00.407 --> 00:46:02.510
They only said what you already know.

734
00:46:03.244 --> 00:46:04.411
They told me to wait.

735
00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:07.782
Why do I suddenly have an older sister?

736
00:46:10.284 --> 00:46:12.086
Do you remember her?

737
00:46:12.686 --> 00:46:13.821
Not really.

738
00:46:14.321 --> 00:46:16.390
Memories are what we remember,

739
00:46:16.957 --> 00:46:19.226
but we weren't allowed to even mention Eun Seok.

740
00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.428
She's extremely poor.

741
00:46:21.495 --> 00:46:23.931
That's why Mom wants to bring her back right away.

742
00:46:24.865 --> 00:46:26.066
Eun Seok?

743
00:46:49.256 --> 00:46:51.392
(Contacts, Victim)

744
00:47:02.837 --> 00:47:03.838
(Please call back)

745
00:47:03.838 --> 00:47:05.406
It's been over a week.

746
00:47:05.706 --> 00:47:07.341
Isn't that too long?

747
00:47:08.976 --> 00:47:10.077
Mr. Sun Woo.

748
00:47:14.048 --> 00:47:15.216
Mr. Sun Woo.

749
00:47:16.217 --> 00:47:19.220
- What? - Just give a call.

750
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:21.856
Did the carpentry camp call?

751
00:47:22.323 --> 00:47:23.891
I told them we'll leave before 1pm.

752
00:47:23.958 --> 00:47:26.260
Shall I press the call button for you?

753
00:47:26.493 --> 00:47:28.162
Do you not have the courage?

754
00:47:30.698 --> 00:47:33.367
There's a time when you shouldn't call.

755
00:47:34.201 --> 00:47:36.837
- Why did you call me? - You said you'd help us.

756
00:47:38.505 --> 00:47:39.640
Sorry.

757
00:47:43.878 --> 00:47:45.512
Why pull up the carpentry camp schedule...

758
00:47:45.512 --> 00:47:47.948
of all things?

759
00:47:48.816 --> 00:47:50.951
He's been really strange lately.

760
00:47:54.989 --> 00:47:56.657
Was she in another accident?

761
00:47:57.057 --> 00:47:59.526
What's the point in staring and not calling?

762
00:47:59.526 --> 00:48:00.928
I'm worried, that's...

763
00:48:02.096 --> 00:48:03.197
why.

764
00:48:32.927 --> 00:48:35.496
Do Kyung. Do Kyung?

765
00:48:40.968 --> 00:48:42.469
I dozed off.

766
00:48:44.138 --> 00:48:45.139
Come in.

767
00:48:47.608 --> 00:48:49.643
Gi Jae called me.

768
00:48:49.643 --> 00:48:51.645
He says you aren't answering your phone.

769
00:48:52.379 --> 00:48:54.281
I had a long day.

770
00:48:54.281 --> 00:48:55.716
I didn't hear it ring.

771
00:48:56.216 --> 00:48:57.518
Okay, thanks.

772
00:49:01.989 --> 00:49:03.090
Where is it?

773
00:49:04.825 --> 00:49:06.160
It's in my car.

774
00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.408
(Bus schedule)

775
00:49:25.379 --> 00:49:28.449
There are no more buses tonight.

776
00:49:28.949 --> 00:49:30.417
Where are you headed?

777
00:49:31.952 --> 00:49:33.187
Do you need a lift?

778
00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.090
No, my husband's on his way.

779
00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.525
Is he? That's a relief, then.

780
00:49:47.935 --> 00:49:50.971
Ji Soo, can you stay awake and pay the taxi fare?

781
00:49:55.175 --> 00:49:56.777
Taxi for hire.

782
00:49:56.777 --> 00:49:59.279
I need a taxi. I'm going to Seoul.

783
00:49:59.346 --> 00:50:01.415
There aren't any headed that way.

784
00:50:01.548 --> 00:50:04.418
It's raining hard, and drivers won't go that far.

785
00:50:04.551 --> 00:50:05.786
Sorry.

786
00:50:07.388 --> 00:50:08.989
What should I do?

787
00:50:18.365 --> 00:50:21.201
(Assailant)

788
00:50:21.201 --> 00:50:22.469
(Read message)

789
00:50:23.971 --> 00:50:25.839
They're cleaning up now.

790
00:50:25.839 --> 00:50:28.475
Where are you? I'm all alone right now.

791
00:50:28.475 --> 00:50:30.677
Tell me whether to wait or leave.

792
00:50:30.677 --> 00:50:32.279
Why won't you pick up?

793
00:50:32.346 --> 00:50:34.948
I spent all I had to get here. I have no cash.

794
00:50:34.948 --> 00:50:36.550
You're a third-generation chaebol?

795
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:38.485
That's great. Good for you.

796
00:50:38.485 --> 00:50:40.454
I don't want to be clingy.

797
00:50:40.454 --> 00:50:43.257
I'll wait until you come. Even if it's all night.

798
00:51:01.642 --> 00:51:04.178
Let's not meet like this ever again and end this.

799
00:51:04.178 --> 00:51:06.113
I want to end it today.

800
00:51:06.413 --> 00:51:07.948
What a jerk.

801
00:51:43.951 --> 00:51:47.221
Mom. Mom...

802
00:51:52.526 --> 00:51:55.262
(Battery: 1 percent)

803
00:51:56.029 --> 00:51:58.365
Oh no. What should I do?

804
00:52:01.468 --> 00:52:02.870
Hyuk.

805
00:52:03.837 --> 00:52:06.106
Why do you sound like that?

806
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.509
I'm so scared.

807
00:52:09.276 --> 00:52:11.178
I'll be right there. Wait.

808
00:52:13.947 --> 00:52:16.049
I have to be somewhere.

809
00:52:16.049 --> 00:52:17.317
Take care of the rest.

810
00:52:17.518 --> 00:52:21.388
You want us to do all this alone?

811
00:52:28.428 --> 00:52:29.696
The phone is off.

812
00:52:29.696 --> 00:52:31.431
- What? - Please leave a message.

813
00:52:31.431 --> 00:52:34.067
What is wrong with this woman?

814
00:52:34.067 --> 00:52:35.936
Why did she turn off her phone?

815
00:52:35.936 --> 00:52:37.471
What is she trying to do?

816
00:52:38.071 --> 00:52:41.408
Did she really think I'll show up,

817
00:52:41.408 --> 00:52:42.976
so she's messing with me?

818
00:52:43.143 --> 00:52:44.511
This is unbelievable.

819
00:52:48.782 --> 00:52:50.317
Who's that?

820
00:52:51.785 --> 00:52:54.121
Can you speed up? Why are you so slow?

821
00:53:02.629 --> 00:53:05.566
What do you want me to do?

822
00:53:05.566 --> 00:53:07.568
What is it you want?

823
00:53:11.305 --> 00:53:14.408
We must slow down by 20 percent when it rains.

824
00:53:33.393 --> 00:53:34.928
What a jerk.

825
00:53:48.875 --> 00:53:50.077
Where are you?

826
00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:53.013
I don't know where I am,

827
00:53:53.013 --> 00:53:55.616
and my phone's low on battery.

828
00:53:55.616 --> 00:53:58.185
Did you see any stores or road signs?

829
00:53:58.485 --> 00:54:00.821
One said "To Daesung-ri".

830
00:54:01.121 --> 00:54:04.491
Then go into the first gas station you find,

831
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:06.660
borrow a phone, and call me.

832
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.662
Is this the gas station?

833
00:54:09.429 --> 00:54:11.865
The first gas station, okay?

834
00:54:11.865 --> 00:54:12.966
Okay?

835
00:54:23.644 --> 00:54:24.778
Ji An.

836
00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:27.748
Hyuk.

837
00:54:31.718 --> 00:54:32.986
Are you okay?

838
00:54:45.032 --> 00:54:46.266
Let's go home.

839
00:54:48.135 --> 00:54:49.569
Take your time.

840
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.046
I'm glad she's safe,

841
00:55:00.347 --> 00:55:02.215
but she said she'd wait.

842
00:55:03.617 --> 00:55:05.218
She called her boyfriend.

843
00:55:16.897 --> 00:55:19.199
See you, Ji An. Call me.

844
00:55:24.237 --> 00:55:25.739
They got close pretty fast.

845
00:55:30.877 --> 00:55:32.179
(Assailant)

846
00:55:32.179 --> 00:55:33.380
(Text messages)

847
00:55:37.517 --> 00:55:38.719
Thank you.

848
00:55:38.985 --> 00:55:40.187
I'll turn on the heater.

849
00:55:42.723 --> 00:55:45.125
Let's charge your phone. You should call home.

850
00:55:45.125 --> 00:55:47.427
Right. Let me do it.

851
00:55:56.837 --> 00:55:58.205
(Text message)

852
00:56:01.508 --> 00:56:03.510
I'm texting because I couldn't get through.

853
00:56:03.777 --> 00:56:06.279
I'm sorry I had to leave on urgent business.

854
00:56:06.546 --> 00:56:07.948
Call me when you can.

855
00:56:08.048 --> 00:56:09.616
I'll pay what I owe.

856
00:56:10.283 --> 00:56:11.985
Text me your bank account...

857
00:56:11.985 --> 00:56:13.286
and what I owe you now.

858
00:56:13.286 --> 00:56:14.788
I'll wire you the money.

859
00:56:31.037 --> 00:56:33.974
Sun Woo Hyuk, why won't you ask?

860
00:56:34.741 --> 00:56:35.842
Ask what?

861
00:56:38.278 --> 00:56:41.281
Don't you want to know why I'm out here like this?

862
00:56:43.049 --> 00:56:44.451
Must I know everything?

863
00:56:45.986 --> 00:56:47.187
Get some sleep.

864
00:56:47.187 --> 00:56:49.156
You must have work tomorrow.

865
00:56:49.156 --> 00:56:50.323
It's already 2am.

866
00:56:51.358 --> 00:56:53.026
I don't work tomorrow.

867
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.528
I got fired.

868
00:56:58.365 --> 00:56:59.566
Things happened.

869
00:57:01.268 --> 00:57:03.970
Have you eaten? Let's get some hot soup.

870
00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:06.239
There's a 24-hour restaurant on the way.

871
00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.276
No thanks, I'm too sleepy.

872
00:57:09.476 --> 00:57:10.977
I'd rather sleep.

873
00:57:12.846 --> 00:57:14.681
Okay, then. Sleep.

874
00:57:16.016 --> 00:57:18.485
Daebang-dong, right? I'll wake you when we're there.

875
00:57:18.485 --> 00:57:19.486
Okay.

876
00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:33.133
Thanks.

877
00:57:40.006 --> 00:57:41.308
Just take it.

878
00:57:41.608 --> 00:57:43.910
You're all wet. You'll catch a cold.

879
00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:45.645
I'm fine.

880
00:57:45.779 --> 00:57:47.914
Just give it back after washing it.

881
00:57:48.548 --> 00:57:50.550
All right. I will.

882
00:57:50.717 --> 00:57:51.818
I'll treat you next time.

883
00:57:51.885 --> 00:57:53.119
You better.

884
00:57:54.321 --> 00:57:56.256
Go in, and get some sleep.

885
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:59.659
Thank you. Thank you so much for today.

886
00:58:00.994 --> 00:58:02.896
I like pork belly.

887
00:58:03.296 --> 00:58:04.397
Buy me pork belly.

888
00:58:05.065 --> 00:58:06.066
Okay.

889
00:58:06.867 --> 00:58:08.068
I'll go in now.

890
00:58:08.235 --> 00:58:09.302
Bye.

891
00:58:41.568 --> 00:58:44.304
Hello. I'm here.

892
00:58:44.571 --> 00:58:46.139
It's your day off. What are you doing here?

893
00:58:46.339 --> 00:58:48.608
You have an ingredient delivery today.

894
00:58:48.675 --> 00:58:49.910
I'm here to help you.

895
00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:55.515
I'm fine.

896
00:58:55.615 --> 00:58:58.785
This is nothing to me.

897
00:59:00.453 --> 00:59:01.988
This is something to you.

898
00:59:02.489 --> 00:59:04.824
I don't need help. You can leave.

899
00:59:06.426 --> 00:59:09.696
What are these white beans for?

900
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:12.532
I told you to know your place.

901
00:59:13.066 --> 00:59:14.801
You don't need to teach me your techniques,

902
00:59:14.968 --> 00:59:17.070
but you can still give me hints.

903
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.409
I hired you...

904
00:59:22.642 --> 00:59:24.277
for the storefront,

905
00:59:25.445 --> 00:59:26.947
so stop bugging me, and leave.

906
00:59:29.115 --> 00:59:30.517
I said get out.

907
00:59:34.054 --> 00:59:35.055
Get out.

908
00:59:55.075 --> 00:59:56.076
Ji An.

909
00:59:57.143 --> 00:59:58.144
Wake up.

910
00:59:58.678 --> 00:59:59.946
Ji An. Wake up.

911
01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:07.721
What is it?

912
01:00:08.388 --> 01:00:10.323
Wake up. It's 11am.

913
01:00:10.323 --> 01:00:13.760
I quit the part-time job as you said,

914
01:00:15.495 --> 01:00:19.265
so I went out to have fun last night.

915
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.135
Did you make hangover soup?

916
01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:25.138
Did you think I was drunk?

917
01:00:25.138 --> 01:00:26.640
No.

918
01:00:26.973 --> 01:00:30.777
I got off at the wrong bus stop,

919
01:00:31.678 --> 01:00:33.546
and it started raining,

920
01:00:34.614 --> 01:00:36.182
so I got home late.

921
01:00:36.916 --> 01:00:38.385
Just get up!

922
01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.591
Get ready. We need to go somewhere.

923
01:00:46.026 --> 01:00:47.260
Put this on.

924
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:50.597
Go where?

925
01:00:50.764 --> 01:00:52.365
Let's go out for a meal.

926
01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:55.235
What for? We can eat at home.

927
01:00:55.335 --> 01:00:56.569
Make sure to wear makeup.

928
01:01:05.645 --> 01:01:07.781
Why are we going to a hotel?

929
01:01:09.449 --> 01:01:10.617
Am I going on a blind date?

930
01:01:11.985 --> 01:01:15.055
Mom. Are you taking me out for a blind date?

931
01:01:15.555 --> 01:01:16.890
You'll see.

932
01:01:17.657 --> 01:01:19.359
Mom.

933
01:01:25.065 --> 01:01:26.466
Are you Yang Mi Jung?

934
01:01:27.167 --> 01:01:29.135
- Yes. - This way please.

935
01:01:29.836 --> 01:01:32.138
Aren't you going to tell me what's going on?

936
01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.875
This is weird.

937
01:01:51.658 --> 01:01:52.659
Mom.

938
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.029
They're my friends.

939
01:01:56.429 --> 01:01:57.697
Say hello, and have a seat.

940
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.636
Hello. I'm Seo Ji An.

941
01:02:14.547 --> 01:02:15.682
She hasn't...

942
01:02:16.182 --> 01:02:18.585
had breakfast yet.

943
01:02:19.219 --> 01:02:21.488
Let's get her food first before we talk.

944
01:02:22.088 --> 01:02:23.990
- Well... - Mr. Yoon.

945
01:02:24.758 --> 01:02:26.392
Bring our food in.

946
01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.128
Yes, sir.

947
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.445
Are we here to get me a job?

948
01:02:49.315 --> 01:02:50.450
Eat.

949
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:53.486
We had breakfast, so you can eat first.

950
01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:55.388
Yes.

951
01:03:18.678 --> 01:03:19.679
Mr. Yoon.

952
01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:23.116
Bring all our food in at once. Hurry up.

953
01:03:35.428 --> 01:03:37.130
You're not a picky eater.

954
01:03:39.132 --> 01:03:41.067
I'm not,

955
01:03:41.534 --> 01:03:43.837
but it's also because everything is delicious.

956
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:46.639
It might be because I skipped dinner last night.

957
01:03:51.177 --> 01:03:54.547
She's not picky nor ill disposed.

958
01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:56.816
She's diligent and smart.

959
01:03:57.550 --> 01:03:59.586
She's beyond reproach.

960
01:04:01.487 --> 01:04:03.156
Are you okay? Drink some water.

961
01:04:08.228 --> 01:04:09.662
I'm sorry.

962
01:04:10.763 --> 01:04:13.566
Honestly, I only followed Mom here...

963
01:04:13.566 --> 01:04:15.468
without knowing anything.

964
01:04:16.336 --> 01:04:20.139
I'm not sure why she'd tell you...

965
01:04:20.506 --> 01:04:22.909
these things.

966
01:04:24.744 --> 01:04:28.147
She hasn't told you anything yet?

967
01:04:39.025 --> 01:04:41.527
(Haesung Corporation Chairwoman No Myung Hee)

968
01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:45.365
Oh, my.

969
01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.275
Ji An.

970
01:04:55.508 --> 01:04:56.910
I'm sorry.

971
01:04:58.678 --> 01:05:01.281
Mom, are they from Haesung Corporation?

972
01:05:01.681 --> 01:05:02.882
Yes.

973
01:05:04.017 --> 01:05:05.485
They are Haesung Corporation's...

974
01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.587
vice-chairman and his wife.

975
01:05:09.255 --> 01:05:11.224
How do you know these people?

976
01:05:15.395 --> 01:05:18.031
I got to know them through you.

977
01:05:18.965 --> 01:05:20.066
Me?

978
01:05:21.935 --> 01:05:23.069
They're...

979
01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:26.339
your real parents, Ji An.

980
01:05:32.145 --> 01:05:33.880
What did you just say, Mom?

981
01:05:35.114 --> 01:05:37.050
They're your parents.

982
01:06:30.203 --> 01:06:32.572
(My Golden Life)

983
01:06:33.106 --> 01:06:36.376
You and Dad aren't my real parents?

984
01:06:36.376 --> 01:06:38.277
Is everything all right with Ji An?

985
01:06:38.277 --> 01:06:41.247
What can you do even if she's not?

986
01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:43.116
What happens to Eun Seok now?

987
01:06:43.182 --> 01:06:44.317
We should bring her.

988
01:06:44.317 --> 01:06:46.085
If it turns out you have rich parents,

989
01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.086
would you go?

990
01:06:47.487 --> 01:06:49.989
What is she doing? She rejected my call.

991
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:52.091
Let's see who wins.

992
01:06:52.525 --> 01:06:54.260
Why are you doing this to me?

993
01:06:54.327 --> 01:06:55.928
Why?

994
01:06:55.928 --> 01:06:57.030
I let you off.

995
01:06:57.030 --> 01:06:59.365
If you're going to be arrogant, pay first.

996
01:06:59.799 --> 01:07:03.036
Lend me 20,000 dollars please.
