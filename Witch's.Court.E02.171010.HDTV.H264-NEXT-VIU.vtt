(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:12.807
It has been found that certain people...

4
00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:14.738
have received unnecessary shoulder surgery...

5
00:00:14.738 --> 00:00:18.008
to avoid mandatory military service.

6
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:19.078
Hello.

7
00:00:19.078 --> 00:00:20.148
I'm Ma Yi Deum,

8
00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:22.418
a prosecutor with Criminal Unit 2.

9
00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:24.517
He won't say anything.

10
00:00:24.648 --> 00:00:26.887
We're going to look like complete idiots.

11
00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:28.918
I'll take care of it.

12
00:00:29.517 --> 00:00:31.928
Isn't Ms. Ma amazing?

13
00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:34.297
How did she manage to bring up...

14
00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:36.367
the corruption at the hospital?

15
00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:38.367
You must be Ma Yi Deum.

16
00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:39.767
I heard you're talented.

17
00:00:39.797 --> 00:00:41.468
Yes, I'm pretty good.

18
00:00:41.597 --> 00:00:43.608
I'll do even better now, so please watch me.

19
00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:44.968
Excuse me.

20
00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.138
If you want an exclusive, you need to provide...

21
00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:50.648
some intimacy with the informant.

22
00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:52.578
- What? - Stop it!

23
00:00:52.648 --> 00:00:53.977
Joonga News' Ms. Han.

24
00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:56.748
She reported Mr. Oh for sexual harassment.

25
00:00:57.117 --> 00:00:59.587
Take care of Ms. Han,

26
00:01:00.218 --> 00:01:01.458
and let's go up together.

27
00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:04.127
You're incredible.

28
00:01:04.957 --> 00:01:07.228
Do you want to succeed this badly?

29
00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:09.528
I don't care what you say.

30
00:01:09.657 --> 00:01:10.767
Drop the charges.

31
00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:12.927
That's the only way you and I can survive.

32
00:01:18.608 --> 00:01:20.138
He shoved her up against the wall.

33
00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:23.478
I also saw Ms. Han stomp on his left foot...

34
00:01:23.478 --> 00:01:25.147
with her heel.

35
00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:27.147
Why you...

36
00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:30.088
Hey, you. Oh Soo Chul.

37
00:01:30.847 --> 00:01:32.147
Don't touch me.

38
00:01:32.388 --> 00:01:34.718
Let's meet under better circumstances next time.

39
00:01:34.817 --> 00:01:36.358
That won't happen.

40
00:01:36.657 --> 00:01:38.287
Let's not meet again.

41
00:01:38.427 --> 00:01:39.457
Congratulations.

42
00:01:39.457 --> 00:01:42.058
You're finally a PWNF.

43
00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:44.297
Prosecutor With No Future.

44
00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:45.767
Says who?

45
00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:47.037
I haven't given up on my future.

46
00:01:47.498 --> 00:01:50.438
Sure. A person needs to have hope.

47
00:01:50.907 --> 00:01:52.007
Ms. Son.

48
00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:55.237
What's a Crimes Against Girls Unit?

49
00:01:55.237 --> 00:01:56.407
Oh, CAGU?

50
00:01:56.507 --> 00:01:58.978
Ms. Min Ji Sook started that unit.

51
00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:00.547
Oh my gosh.

52
00:02:00.547 --> 00:02:03.317
The icon of justice, conviction, and demotion.

53
00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:14.428
(Episode 2)

54
00:02:26.137 --> 00:02:28.477
(Crimes Against Girls Unit)

55
00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:36.947
Nice to see you again, Ms. Ma.

56
00:02:41.387 --> 00:02:42.857
(Crimes Against Girls Unit)

57
00:02:45.857 --> 00:02:48.028
Did you get appointed to this unit too?

58
00:02:49.028 --> 00:02:50.998
You too?

59
00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:53.898
Yes.

60
00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:01.208
Hey. I have a name.

61
00:03:02.778 --> 00:03:04.208
Let's properly say hello.

62
00:03:05.947 --> 00:03:07.077
I'm Yeo Jin Wook.

63
00:03:07.877 --> 00:03:10.387
Let's consider it shook. I'm Ma Yi Deum,

64
00:03:10.387 --> 00:03:11.917
and I don't want to get involved with you.

65
00:03:17.787 --> 00:03:19.688
That's unfortunate.

66
00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:20.827
What is?

67
00:03:22.458 --> 00:03:23.998
(Ma Yi Deum, Yeo Jin Wook)

68
00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:36.037
Ms. Son?

69
00:03:36.037 --> 00:03:37.178
Hello, Mr. Yeo.

70
00:03:37.407 --> 00:03:39.507
- I look forward to it. - Same with me.

71
00:03:41.077 --> 00:03:43.817
What a nice office. Do you want the...

72
00:03:49.827 --> 00:03:51.627
It'd be best if she uses it, right?

73
00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:52.627
Yes.

74
00:03:57.998 --> 00:04:00.537
- Do you hate this unit? - Of course I do!

75
00:04:02.398 --> 00:04:03.607
- Why do you hate it? - Why?

76
00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:06.238
Hey.

77
00:04:06.438 --> 00:04:08.037
Were you really in second during law school?

78
00:04:08.607 --> 00:04:11.548
- I was top of the class. - You can still be slow.

79
00:04:11.548 --> 00:04:13.977
I'm not sure. I really don't get it.

80
00:04:14.577 --> 00:04:16.447
Think about it. Both of us...

81
00:04:16.447 --> 00:04:17.887
who messed with the chief prosecutor...

82
00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:20.618
ended up in the same unit.

83
00:04:20.788 --> 00:04:22.517
We're going to have endless late nights.

84
00:04:22.717 --> 00:04:24.827
- That's not true. - What?

85
00:04:24.928 --> 00:04:26.998
Me being appointed here...

86
00:04:26.998 --> 00:04:29.127
has nothing to do with Chief Prosecutor Oh.

87
00:04:29.527 --> 00:04:30.668
How would you know that?

88
00:04:30.897 --> 00:04:32.798
If you persuade me in three seconds,

89
00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.267
I'll consider you as my big brother.

90
00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:37.067
- 1, 2... - I volunteered for it.

91
00:04:38.668 --> 00:04:39.738
What?

92
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.308
You don't have to call me your big brother.

93
00:04:41.637 --> 00:04:43.848
I hate it when women call me that.

94
00:04:44.147 --> 00:04:47.048
Wait. You volunteered to come here?

95
00:04:48.447 --> 00:04:50.188
- Yes. - What?

96
00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:52.548
That's crazy. Bravo.

97
00:04:52.717 --> 00:04:54.757
This is the unit everyone wants to avoid,

98
00:04:54.757 --> 00:04:56.257
and you volunteered. Amazing!

99
00:04:56.387 --> 00:04:57.558
You're awesome!

100
00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:08.298
Mom, he keeps on hitting me.

101
00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:11.137
Mom, In Hyuk keeps on taking my toy.

102
00:05:11.137 --> 00:05:13.777
Where's Grandma? Ask her to buy you one.

103
00:05:14.137 --> 00:05:15.277
Give it back!

104
00:05:15.277 --> 00:05:17.678
Why are there so many documents?

105
00:05:17.678 --> 00:05:20.217
Mom, he hit me here.

106
00:05:20.848 --> 00:05:23.887
- Mom, look. - I'm busy right now.

107
00:05:23.887 --> 00:05:26.688
Also, I told you not to call me at work.

108
00:05:26.717 --> 00:05:29.457
It's not that. Mom.

109
00:05:29.517 --> 00:05:32.228
- He keeps on hitting me. - You little punks.

110
00:05:32.658 --> 00:05:35.527
It's hectic as it is. Stop whining.

111
00:05:35.827 --> 00:05:38.267
If you don't hang up on the count of three,

112
00:05:38.498 --> 00:05:42.067
I'll take away all your toys. One!

113
00:05:52.207 --> 00:05:53.447
Are you married?

114
00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:55.748
- No. - Are you planning to?

115
00:05:55.918 --> 00:05:56.988
- Yes. - Yes.

116
00:05:57.418 --> 00:05:58.918
You don't want to end up like me, right?

117
00:06:00.457 --> 00:06:02.387
I recommend vasectomy.

118
00:06:03.757 --> 00:06:05.658
I won't bother say that we should work hard.

119
00:06:06.127 --> 00:06:08.598
From investigation to trial,

120
00:06:08.598 --> 00:06:11.928
you'll have to work hard to do it in one go.

121
00:06:12.527 --> 00:06:14.238
You all know that sentencing for rapes...

122
00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:15.967
is more complicated.

123
00:06:16.337 --> 00:06:18.438
Electronic anklets and treatment in custody.

124
00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:21.438
For children, the parents can lose their right.

125
00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:25.207
It'd be safe to say you won't have weekends.

126
00:06:27.118 --> 00:06:29.517
However, the more you suffer,

127
00:06:29.548 --> 00:06:31.087
the victims will suffer less.

128
00:06:31.317 --> 00:06:33.118
Yes, I'll remember that.

129
00:06:34.188 --> 00:06:37.688
Let's give our best. Let's applaud.

130
00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:39.188
Clap.

131
00:06:41.697 --> 00:06:43.697
That's it for now. Let's get to work.

132
00:06:43.897 --> 00:06:46.668
Jang, can you take the minor cases...

133
00:06:46.668 --> 00:06:48.067
- for now? - Yes, ma'am.

134
00:06:48.137 --> 00:06:50.967
- Seo, you can assist. - Okay.

135
00:06:51.308 --> 00:06:53.308
Yeo, you can take...

136
00:06:53.478 --> 00:06:55.837
- the female crime cases. - Okay.

137
00:06:58.207 --> 00:07:00.447
Son, you'll focus on desk work.

138
00:07:00.548 --> 00:07:03.288
Koo, you'll assist with the digital investigation.

139
00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:04.348
Okay.

140
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:10.887
Ma, come with me.

141
00:07:26.478 --> 00:07:28.908
Are you disappointed about your appointment?

142
00:07:30.877 --> 00:07:32.908
I apologize for my rude comment.

143
00:07:33.317 --> 00:07:34.817
I applied to a different department...

144
00:07:34.817 --> 00:07:36.317
for personal reasons.

145
00:07:39.488 --> 00:07:42.488
If you have the guts to humiliate...

146
00:07:42.488 --> 00:07:45.757
your chief prosecutor at a disciplinary hearing,

147
00:07:46.627 --> 00:07:48.998
didn't you expect this to happen?

148
00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:50.368
Humiliate...

149
00:07:50.697 --> 00:07:52.228
That's because...

150
00:07:52.228 --> 00:07:53.837
Mr. Oh forced me to commit perjury.

151
00:07:53.868 --> 00:07:56.608
You leak information for media manipulation.

152
00:07:56.808 --> 00:07:58.368
You blow up the smallest events...

153
00:07:58.637 --> 00:08:01.337
to get the attention of higher-ups.

154
00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:04.308
There are a lot of rumors about you.

155
00:08:04.908 --> 00:08:06.007
However,

156
00:08:06.717 --> 00:08:08.678
this is the CAGU.

157
00:08:09.147 --> 00:08:12.017
The victim is questioned by the detective,

158
00:08:12.017 --> 00:08:14.017
the prosecutor, and at the hearing.

159
00:08:14.387 --> 00:08:17.658
They give up after the multiple testimonies.

160
00:08:17.988 --> 00:08:19.587
We made this unit to get rid of that.

161
00:08:19.897 --> 00:08:21.827
Yes. Of course.

162
00:08:22.298 --> 00:08:25.498
This means you won't have a chance in front...

163
00:08:25.697 --> 00:08:27.337
of the camera for winning a case.

164
00:08:27.538 --> 00:08:29.168
Yes, I understand.

165
00:08:30.538 --> 00:08:32.367
Also, let me tell you this in advance.

166
00:08:32.808 --> 00:08:35.408
If you don't like your assignment,

167
00:08:35.538 --> 00:08:37.008
resigning is an option.

168
00:08:37.008 --> 00:08:39.678
What? Resign? My goal is retirement.

169
00:08:40.117 --> 00:08:42.178
I'll consider it as an encouragement.

170
00:08:44.747 --> 00:08:46.018
- You can go. - Okay!

171
00:08:50.258 --> 00:08:51.857
How can it go wrong on the first day?

172
00:08:51.957 --> 00:08:53.258
What? Resign?

173
00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:55.697
Who do you take me for?

174
00:08:55.798 --> 00:08:59.567
You'll see in two years. You'll beg me to stay.

175
00:09:01.237 --> 00:09:03.768
Did she assign you to a special case?

176
00:09:04.008 --> 00:09:06.938
You're having one-on-ones with the boss on day one.

177
00:09:07.378 --> 00:09:08.638
Yes, sure.

178
00:09:09.207 --> 00:09:10.847
Anyway, let's try to get along.

179
00:09:10.847 --> 00:09:13.217
I never thought I'd be working...

180
00:09:13.317 --> 00:09:15.378
with the infamous Ms. Ma.

181
00:09:16.247 --> 00:09:17.788
Have a great day.

182
00:09:24.528 --> 00:09:26.227
What is it now?

183
00:09:30.727 --> 00:09:32.067
How rude.

184
00:09:32.128 --> 00:09:34.497
What is it? Why is she famous?

185
00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:36.268
Don't be curious.

186
00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:38.837
You'll find out soon enough.

187
00:09:39.467 --> 00:09:40.737
Rude?

00:10:26.688 --> 00:10:29.558
Why? Why didn't my thesis make it in?

195
00:10:31.688 --> 00:10:33.028
It was below standard.

196
00:10:33.727 --> 00:10:35.857
This is impossible. Please review it again.

197
00:10:36.567 --> 00:10:38.867
I can't go back on my decision.

198
00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:42.967
Can you leave?

199
00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:44.207
I don't want to.

200
00:10:46.808 --> 00:10:48.107
Then I'll leave.

201
00:11:00.418 --> 00:11:03.487
You... You're a disappointment.

202
00:11:11.268 --> 00:11:12.528
What are you doing?

203
00:11:32.987 --> 00:11:36.727
So a male TA raped a female professor?

204
00:11:36.928 --> 00:11:39.288
No. He tried, but he failed.

205
00:11:41.258 --> 00:11:42.327
This the CCTV footage...

206
00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:45.668
of the hallway in front of her office that day.

207
00:11:45.898 --> 00:11:48.367
That's Kim Se Mi. She's an undergraduate.

208
00:11:48.367 --> 00:11:51.707
She was bringing back Professor Sun's laptop.

209
00:12:00.418 --> 00:12:02.347
It ended as an attempted rape.

210
00:12:02.477 --> 00:12:03.487
Yes.

211
00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:05.518
Is this all we have as evidence?

212
00:12:05.518 --> 00:12:06.758
We don't have any record of his DNA.

213
00:12:06.758 --> 00:12:09.087
He hasn't gone through the rape inspection kit.

214
00:12:09.087 --> 00:12:11.028
We only have evidence of the assault...

215
00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:13.298
and the witness' testimony.

216
00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:15.827
Okay, we have the basics down.

217
00:12:15.827 --> 00:12:16.997
Let's go investigate.

218
00:12:17.428 --> 00:12:19.268
Is the victim here?

219
00:12:19.798 --> 00:12:22.997
I think you have to go see her yourself.

220
00:12:23.668 --> 00:12:24.668

Normally when we get testimonies,

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.607
it's recorded at investigation agencies.

Since you're not doing well,

227
00:13:08.817 --> 00:13:10.548
we'll record it here today.

228
00:13:10.548 --> 00:13:12.688
We'll start with the investigation.

229
00:13:22.528 --> 00:13:24.398
That male TA...

230
00:13:26.837 --> 00:13:29.067
was reeking of alcohol.

231
00:13:31.467 --> 00:13:33.878
Anyway, he didn't look sane.

232
00:13:35.138 --> 00:13:38.178
We bickered for a while, then I looked at my watch.

233
00:13:40.048 --> 00:13:42.317
It was 10 minutes to 11pm.

234
00:13:43.587 --> 00:13:44.747
That building...

235
00:13:45.918 --> 00:13:48.688
closes its doors from the outside at 11pm.

236
00:13:50.827 --> 00:13:53.258
The young man was having a crazy fit.

237
00:13:54.697 --> 00:13:58.398
Then I thought about being locked in with him.

238
00:13:59.327 --> 00:14:01.168
I suddenly feared for myself.

239
00:14:09.077 --> 00:14:10.607
Let's talk tomorrow, Woo Sung.

240
00:14:13.817 --> 00:14:15.048
What are you doing?

241
00:14:15.317 --> 00:14:16.388
Move.

242
00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:18.117
You can't leave like this.

243
00:14:19.087 --> 00:14:21.658
We can talk tomorrow when you're sober.

244
00:14:23.758 --> 00:14:24.758
Then...

245
00:14:25.528 --> 00:14:27.158
As I tried to leave,

246
00:14:29.298 --> 00:14:31.097
I fell on the couch.

247
00:14:31.097 --> 00:14:32.327
What are you doing?

248
00:14:32.327 --> 00:14:34.168
My skirt ran up.

249
00:14:35.837 --> 00:14:37.908
That was the beginning.

250
00:14:40.038 --> 00:14:41.337
With one hand,

251
00:14:42.337 --> 00:14:45.778
he pressed down on my wrists.

252
00:14:46.477 --> 00:14:47.847
With the other hand...

253
00:14:59.058 --> 00:15:00.798
Aside from the pain,

254
00:15:03.697 --> 00:15:05.028
I was ashamed.

255
00:15:06.597 --> 00:15:08.438
I couldn't think straight.

256
00:15:12.938 --> 00:15:15.077
Do you know what he said to me?

257
00:15:19.048 --> 00:15:20.947
Women born to wealthy parents...

258
00:15:20.947 --> 00:15:22.648
will never get over yourselves...

259
00:15:23.388 --> 00:15:25.617
until you're taught a lesson.

260
00:15:27.987 --> 00:15:29.317
How can he do that to me?

261
00:15:35.798 --> 00:15:38.428
I had a feeling it'd only get worse.

262
00:15:39.567 --> 00:15:41.438
I told him to stop now.

263
00:15:45.707 --> 00:15:47.808
I told him I'd sue him if he didn't.

264
00:15:50.048 --> 00:15:51.378
Then he suddenly...

265
00:15:55.617 --> 00:15:57.288
started to choke me.

266
00:15:57.617 --> 00:15:59.717
I didn't do that, I swear!

267
00:16:05.428 --> 00:16:06.457
Woo Sung.

268
00:16:07.928 --> 00:16:09.898
You realize you're on camera, right?

269
00:16:10.227 --> 00:16:12.298
If you act emotional,

270
00:16:12.668 --> 00:16:13.867
it'll be disadvantageous for you.

271
00:16:14.737 --> 00:16:17.538
Instead of denying it, tell us what happened.

272
00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:22.337
I'm in debt because of my tuition.

273
00:16:22.337 --> 00:16:23.947
I bought three rice balls for a day's meal.

274
00:16:23.947 --> 00:16:25.477
A bowl of ramyeon lasted me three days.

275
00:16:25.477 --> 00:16:28.217
It was hard to survive the last two years.

276
00:16:28.918 --> 00:16:30.388
I really had to graduate.

277
00:16:30.688 --> 00:16:32.148
I went to see her...

278
00:16:32.148 --> 00:16:33.457
and asked her to revisit my thesis.

279
00:16:33.457 --> 00:16:36.117
I told her I'd die if I can't graduate.

280
00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:39.487
Your thesis is garbage, just like you.

281
00:16:41.398 --> 00:16:42.428
Move.

282
00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:52.107
I just lost it at that point.

283
00:16:52.107 --> 00:16:55.378
I wanted to kill her.

284
00:16:58.308 --> 00:16:59.817
Then you admit to assaulting her,

285
00:16:59.817 --> 00:17:01.918
but you never had any sexual interaction.

286
00:17:02.217 --> 00:17:03.347
Is that what you mean?

287
00:17:04.447 --> 00:17:05.517
Yes.

288
00:17:21.138 --> 00:17:22.237
Then what is this?

289
00:17:24.568 --> 00:17:25.967
If you didn't have any sexual interaction,

290
00:17:25.967 --> 00:17:27.878
why is your shirt open?

291
00:17:30.307 --> 00:17:31.747
Well...

292
00:17:32.477 --> 00:17:34.648
Do you only admit to choking her?

293
00:17:39.247 --> 00:17:41.517
Just be honest with us.

294
00:17:43.588 --> 00:17:44.658
No, I...

295
00:17:44.957 --> 00:17:47.497
I really didn't do it. I...

296
00:17:47.757 --> 00:17:50.368
I never sexually harassed the professor.

297

(Female professor attempted rape case)

298
00:18:05.908 --> 00:18:07.717
- Hello. - Professor Sun's case.

299
00:18:07.717 --> 00:18:10.188
Submit a statement saying it's attempted rape...

300
00:18:10.447 --> 00:18:11.747
by tomorrow morning.

301
00:18:12.047 --> 00:18:13.057
Pardon?

302
00:18:13.487 --> 00:18:15.487
I forgot we should split up tasks.

303
00:18:15.517 --> 00:18:18.428
Yeo, when did you join the Prosecutors' Office?

304
00:18:19.088 --> 00:18:22.057
About 10 months ago.

305
00:18:22.057 --> 00:18:23.227
It's been seven years for me.

306
00:18:23.527 --> 00:18:26.967
Which means I've been through all sorts...

307
00:18:26.967 --> 00:18:28.767
of hardships already.

308
00:18:29.707 --> 00:18:31.237
- And your point? - There is...

309
00:18:31.237 --> 00:18:34.878
a veteran of seven years and a newbie.

310
00:18:34.878 --> 00:18:37.678
Of course, the work should split accordingly.

311
00:18:37.947 --> 00:18:41.447
Are you saying I should assist you?

312
00:18:41.447 --> 00:18:42.547
Of course.

313
00:18:42.918 --> 00:18:44.747
Don't be pressured though.

314
00:18:44.747 --> 00:18:48.658
All you have to do is follow my instructions,

315
00:18:48.658 --> 00:18:50.158
orders, and requests.

316
00:18:51.328 --> 00:18:53.957
I'm not trying to discipline you.

317
00:18:54.697 --> 00:18:56.598
That's how I started too.

318
00:18:58.128 --> 00:19:00.697
All right. Sure.

319
00:19:05.368 --> 00:19:07.608
We have to keep investigating this case.

320
00:19:08.307 --> 00:19:09.338
Why?

321
00:19:09.537 --> 00:19:11.507
The assailant's testimony is full of holes...

322
00:19:11.507 --> 00:19:14.848
while the victim's is very persuasive.

323
00:19:14.848 --> 00:19:16.648
Also, at the time of the assault,

324
00:19:16.648 --> 00:19:19.858
the witness saw the helpless victim.

325
00:19:20.188 --> 00:19:21.888
The relationship between the two people...

326
00:19:21.888 --> 00:19:24.057
is too distinct for an accidental rape.

327
00:19:24.757 --> 00:19:26.527
She is in charge of grading his thesis.

328
00:19:26.527 --> 00:19:28.828
Would any TA rape their professor like this?

329
00:19:29.398 --> 00:19:32.227
Also, there's something different about Woo Sung.

330
00:19:32.227 --> 00:19:33.237
Stop.

331
00:19:35.068 --> 00:19:37.138
- Evidence. - Pardon?

332
00:19:37.138 --> 00:19:40.507
I don't need assumptions. Show me the evidence.

333
00:19:45.848 --> 00:19:49.217
I heard that you used to be a psychiatrist.

334
00:19:49.217 --> 00:19:52.388
However, this isn't where you analyze people.

335
00:19:52.717 --> 00:19:54.618
The substantive truth of this case...

336
00:19:54.618 --> 00:19:57.388
is that the TA tried and failed to rape her.

337
00:19:57.388 --> 00:19:59.898
And what does our team need? Speed.

338
00:20:00.057 --> 00:20:01.257
Is it clear now?

339
00:20:02.057 --> 00:20:03.098
Write the statement.

340
00:20:03.098 --> 00:20:04.628
I have to work on the next case.

341
00:20:06.027 --> 00:20:07.037
Ms. Ma...

342
00:20:07.297 --> 00:20:09.197
- Yes, Yoo Mi. - You fool.

343
00:20:09.197 --> 00:20:11.707
You're about to get kicked out of your place!

344
00:20:11.807 --> 00:20:13.578
Me? Why?

345
00:20:14.477 --> 00:20:15.838
Your lease is up,

346
00:20:15.838 --> 00:20:18.507
and you ignored the calls from the realtor.

347
00:20:18.507 --> 00:20:19.578
The realtor?

348
00:20:27.088 --> 00:20:28.557
Who are you?

349
00:20:30.628 --> 00:20:31.957
I knew it.

350
00:20:32.088 --> 00:20:34.227
There's a new landlord. Call them now.

351
00:20:34.497 --> 00:20:35.557
Okay.

352
00:20:37.267 --> 00:20:38.797
- I... - I'll be back in an hour.

353
00:20:40.668 --> 00:20:42.568
Ms. Ma, are you going...

354
00:20:43.267 --> 00:20:44.338
Ms. Son.

355
00:20:44.507 --> 00:20:47.338
Where's the security video for Professor Sun's case?

356
00:20:48.477 --> 00:20:51.078
The video room should be making a copy.

357
00:21:28.517 --> 00:21:29.618
Hello?

358
00:21:31.918 --> 00:21:33.158
She's here?

359
00:21:34.787 --> 00:21:36.118
Okay, I'm coming.

360
00:21:43.868 --> 00:21:46.898
Why? Why are you my new landlord?

361
00:21:46.898 --> 00:21:50.368
(Landlord: Yeo In Wook)

362
00:21:50.938 --> 00:21:53.878
I know. How was it the unit you're living in?

363
00:21:53.878 --> 00:21:56.447
What about the one you went into when we met?

364
00:22:02.217 --> 00:22:03.287
Happy?

365
00:22:06.348 --> 00:22:07.888
That's my mother's.

366
00:22:08.057 --> 00:22:10.557
Yours is mine.

367
00:22:10.987 --> 00:22:14.398
Are you bragging that you have two apartments?

368
00:22:14.457 --> 00:22:17.628
This building was cheaper than others.

369
00:22:18.168 --> 00:22:21.368
My mother said that since prosecutors don't...

370
00:22:21.438 --> 00:22:23.707
get paid much, I should collect rent.

371
00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:26.477
That's great thinking.

372
00:22:27.178 --> 00:22:29.108
In these hard times,

373
00:22:29.307 --> 00:22:31.777
Receiving rent every month...

374
00:22:31.777 --> 00:22:34.277
is the happiest thing.

375
00:22:35.447 --> 00:22:36.487
So?

376
00:22:36.818 --> 00:22:38.747
You have a lease with a 100,000-dollar deposit.

377
00:22:39.217 --> 00:22:40.217
Yes.

378
00:22:40.287 --> 00:22:43.957
And you want to convert to to a monthly rental?

379
00:22:47.297 --> 00:22:48.497
Just a minute.

380
00:22:56.507 --> 00:22:57.807
I get it.

381
00:22:59.507 --> 00:23:01.638
The monthly rate for the unit...

382
00:23:02.078 --> 00:23:04.447
is a 10,000-dollar deposit and 900 dollars at month,

383
00:23:04.678 --> 00:23:07.747
but he says he'll cut it to 800 dollars a month.

384
00:23:08.047 --> 00:23:09.447
- 800 dollars? - Yes.

385
00:23:09.717 --> 00:23:12.047
If the deposit is 50,000, rent is 850.

386
00:23:12.918 --> 00:23:14.757
Isn't it too low? Are you sure?

387
00:23:15.217 --> 00:23:16.757
I feel like you'll regret it.

388
00:23:16.858 --> 00:23:19.457
Okay. He says 850.

389
00:23:20.257 --> 00:23:21.527
Will you take it or not?

390
00:23:30.207 --> 00:23:31.807
Okay, then.

391
00:23:32.007 --> 00:23:34.307
Tell me when you have a move-out date.

392
00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:40.947
Look, Yeo.

393
00:23:42.977 --> 00:23:44.717
- I'm so humiliated. - My elbow.

394
00:23:45.688 --> 00:23:46.818
I'm so humiliated.

395
00:23:47.118 --> 00:23:50.328
I didn't want to say this and seem petty,

396
00:23:50.957 --> 00:23:53.898
but I barely got the 100,000 dollars...

397
00:23:53.898 --> 00:23:55.727
from a bank for a high interest.

398
00:23:55.727 --> 00:23:56.967
- Okay. - Plus,

399
00:23:56.967 --> 00:23:58.568
50,000 in debt from my college tuition...

400
00:23:58.568 --> 00:23:59.767
and studying for the bar.

401
00:23:59.767 --> 00:24:01.168
I'm still paying those back.

402
00:24:01.168 --> 00:24:03.307
I get cosmetics on sale, no-brand clothes,

403
00:24:03.307 --> 00:24:05.668
and eat three meals a day at a cafeteria!

404
00:24:05.868 --> 00:24:08.037
I'm barely surviving, okay?

405
00:24:08.408 --> 00:24:10.848
But if you change it to monthly, how am I...

406
00:24:11.477 --> 00:24:12.947
supposed to pay you?

407
00:24:14.547 --> 00:24:16.588
Can't you be nice, given my situation?

408
00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:19.318
What? I'm already giving you a great deal.

409
00:24:19.717 --> 00:24:22.257
No. You need to do it for me!

410
00:24:22.418 --> 00:24:23.727
No matter what!

411
00:24:25.757 --> 00:24:26.898
Ms. Ma.

412
00:24:28.658 --> 00:24:31.168
Where are you going? Shall we go back together?

413
00:24:31.598 --> 00:24:34.297
My landlord wants me out. I should find a new place.

414
00:24:35.967 --> 00:24:37.007
I guess so.

415
00:24:37.707 --> 00:24:40.138
Okay, then. Start looking.

416
00:24:41.477 --> 00:24:42.578
I'll go first.

417
00:24:47.418 --> 00:24:48.578
Why that...

418
00:24:49.477 --> 00:24:50.547
Shoot.

419
00:24:53.388 --> 00:24:54.517
Ms. Ma.

420
00:24:54.818 --> 00:24:56.858
Yes?

421
00:24:58.027 --> 00:25:01.057
About the female professor case,

422
00:25:01.957 --> 00:25:04.697
I saw something odd on the surveillance video.

423
00:25:05.297 --> 00:25:06.868
Would you review it with me?

424
00:25:08.668 --> 00:25:10.608
I'm still new on the job,

425
00:25:10.938 --> 00:25:12.568
so it's hard to judge by myself.

426
00:25:13.777 --> 00:25:16.277
What would you like to review?

427
00:25:18.007 --> 00:25:19.047
Watch.

428
00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:35.227
If it's as Professor Sun asserts,

429
00:25:35.757 --> 00:25:38.068
Woo Sung was just caught trying to rape her.

430
00:25:38.628 --> 00:25:42.068
He dropped his phone when he ran into Se Mi.

431
00:25:44.068 --> 00:25:46.477
He should've picked it up and run away,

432
00:25:47.477 --> 00:25:49.777
but he looks at it for two whole seconds.

433
00:25:50.477 --> 00:25:52.947
- Why you think that is? - Because it cracked?

434
00:25:54.118 --> 00:25:55.148
Pardon?

435
00:25:55.547 --> 00:25:59.588
If he's paying it off, and the screen cracks...

436
00:25:59.588 --> 00:26:00.957
Think again.

437
00:26:13.297 --> 00:26:14.297
No way.

438
00:26:14.938 --> 00:26:16.737
Either the phone rang right then,

439
00:26:18.938 --> 00:26:20.037
or he was in the middle of a call.

440
00:26:22.438 --> 00:26:24.378
He was talking to someone.

441
00:26:24.707 --> 00:26:26.547
Yoon Min Joo.

442
00:26:26.547 --> 00:26:29.678
They speak at least three times a day.

443
00:26:29.678 --> 00:26:31.217
His girlfriend.

444
00:26:31.217 --> 00:26:32.418
And the day of the incident?

445
00:26:32.418 --> 00:26:36.118
They began talking at 10:16pm,

446
00:26:36.118 --> 00:26:38.457
and ended at 10:53pm.

447
00:26:38.588 --> 00:26:41.727
It coincides with when he was in the office.

448
00:26:41.828 --> 00:26:45.267
That means Min Joo heard everything...

449
00:26:45.267 --> 00:26:46.868
that happened.

450
00:26:47.237 --> 00:26:49.037
Is she a pervert? Why was she listening?

451
00:26:49.237 --> 00:26:50.967
Let's meet her first.

452
00:26:58.908 --> 00:27:00.217
How may I help you?

453
00:27:00.717 --> 00:27:03.287
We'd like to see Yoon Min Joo.

454
00:27:04.217 --> 00:27:05.688
Dr. Yoon.

455
00:27:07.957 --> 00:27:08.957
Yes?

456
00:27:19.568 --> 00:27:23.237
Woo Sung tends to forget to end the call.

457
00:27:24.307 --> 00:27:25.908
I always nag him about it.

458
00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:28.237
But it actually helped this time.

459
00:27:29.078 --> 00:27:30.247
It helped?

460
00:27:31.148 --> 00:27:33.477
Are you saying he is not the assailant?

461
00:27:34.217 --> 00:27:36.688
No. He's the victim.

462
00:27:37.017 --> 00:27:38.487
Does he know as well...

463
00:27:38.588 --> 00:27:39.888
that the call was recorded?

464
00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:41.717
Yes.

465
00:27:42.217 --> 00:27:44.057
Then he should've submitted it.

466
00:27:44.057 --> 00:27:45.727
Why didn't he?

467
00:27:51.267 --> 00:27:52.727
You're dating, correct?

468
00:27:57.168 --> 00:27:59.307
Woo Sung had the same ring.

469
00:28:04.378 --> 00:28:06.348
I didn't do it.

470
00:28:07.878 --> 00:28:10.588
At first, I thought about cutting out my parts...

471
00:28:10.588 --> 00:28:12.247
and submitting it.

472
00:28:14.118 --> 00:28:15.188
But...

473
00:28:15.957 --> 00:28:17.328
I recently...

474
00:28:18.128 --> 00:28:19.688
came out of the closet.

475
00:28:21.757 --> 00:28:23.997
If it goes to trial, Professor Sun...

476
00:28:24.428 --> 00:28:27.197
will try to find out who submitted the tape.

477
00:28:28.068 --> 00:28:31.037
Then, our relationship will be out in the open.

478
00:28:31.408 --> 00:28:33.638
But he has to become a professor.

479
00:28:34.608 --> 00:28:38.108
What college would hire him, knowing he's gay?

480
00:28:40.447 --> 00:28:43.217
Woo Sung will not talk.

481
00:28:43.848 --> 00:28:45.747
I'll convince him regarding that.

482
00:28:46.118 --> 00:28:48.957
- So you... - What do you mean?

483
00:28:49.618 --> 00:28:51.557
You seem to be confused.

484
00:28:51.557 --> 00:28:53.757
Whether he's homosexual or heterosexual...

485
00:28:53.757 --> 00:28:55.727
is not our concern.

486
00:28:55.727 --> 00:28:58.398
- Ms. Ma. - Since you recorded...

487
00:28:58.398 --> 00:29:01.037
the supposed attach, your phone is evidence.

488
00:29:01.568 --> 00:29:05.537
Will you submit it after we get a warrant?

489
00:29:06.007 --> 00:29:07.707
Or will you give it to us now?

490
00:29:15.678 --> 00:29:17.947
I know how hard you worked on your thesis.

491
00:29:18.787 --> 00:29:22.987
You can pass the exam to become a professor.

492
00:29:23.757 --> 00:29:24.888
Professor.

493
00:29:26.727 --> 00:29:28.057
You have a nice body.

494
00:29:31.727 --> 00:29:32.868
Professor.

495
00:29:39.938 --> 00:29:41.078
No.

496
00:29:44.378 --> 00:29:46.108
This is clear evidence.

497
00:29:46.517 --> 00:29:49.047
Your attempted rape charge will be dropped,

498
00:29:49.178 --> 00:29:51.517
and Sun Hae Young will be investigated.

499
00:29:52.017 --> 00:29:54.418
- Now, as a victim, you... - No.

500
00:29:55.618 --> 00:29:57.057
I refuse.

501
00:29:58.588 --> 00:29:59.588
Pardon?

502
00:30:00.158 --> 00:30:03.227
I won't give a statement as a victim.

503
00:30:05.628 --> 00:30:06.697
Woo Sung.

504
00:30:06.697 --> 00:30:08.737
It's over for you once the trial is over.

505
00:30:09.197 --> 00:30:10.967
But I'll forever be the loser...

506
00:30:10.967 --> 00:30:12.338
who was assaulted by a woman.

507
00:30:12.707 --> 00:30:15.037
If I'm unlucky, they'll find out that I'm gay.

508
00:30:15.838 --> 00:30:17.047
Can you...

509
00:30:17.977 --> 00:30:19.447
take responsibility for that too?

510
00:30:20.717 --> 00:30:21.918
Can you...

511
00:30:23.318 --> 00:30:25.188
live my life for me?

512
00:30:25.188 --> 00:30:27.618
What are you trying to do?

513
00:30:32.457 --> 00:30:33.628
Woo Sung.

514
00:30:35.797 --> 00:30:37.668
All sexual assault victims...

515
00:30:38.197 --> 00:30:40.497
come to trial expecting to be hurt again.

516
00:30:41.267 --> 00:30:43.967
That's because they want the perp to be persecuted.

517
00:30:44.838 --> 00:30:46.638
They believe their assailant should suffer...

518
00:30:46.638 --> 00:30:48.307
the same, no, even half...

519
00:30:49.037 --> 00:30:51.477
of what they suffered.

520
00:30:55.418 --> 00:30:58.818
I thought you may be the victim from the start.

521
00:31:01.118 --> 00:31:04.358
Because I saw in you something...

522
00:31:06.227 --> 00:31:08.328
that every sexual assault victim has.

523
00:31:09.997 --> 00:31:11.128
Self blame.

524
00:31:12.727 --> 00:31:14.537
It's unique...

525
00:31:14.737 --> 00:31:18.138
only to victims of sexual assault.

526
00:31:18.138 --> 00:31:21.477
The assailants often say the victim's at fault too.

527
00:31:36.287 --> 00:31:37.757
Isn't it funny?

528
00:31:39.628 --> 00:31:40.957
Think about it.

529
00:31:43.027 --> 00:31:45.767
Ever since that happened,

530
00:31:46.997 --> 00:31:49.537
you were probably blaming yourself.

531
00:31:50.537 --> 00:31:51.737
"Because I'm gay."

532
00:31:54.777 --> 00:31:56.207
"Because I'm a student."

533
00:31:58.108 --> 00:31:59.818
"Because I'm not manly enough."

534
00:32:01.848 --> 00:32:03.148
But Woo Sung,

535
00:32:05.618 --> 00:32:07.888
you did nothing wrong.

536
00:32:11.057 --> 00:32:12.957
Professor Sun was the one who did wrong.

537
00:32:33.477 --> 00:32:34.717
Even if I testify,

538
00:32:36.047 --> 00:32:38.217
there's no guarantee that she'll be punished.

539
00:32:38.217 --> 00:32:40.057
We'll start with your statement...

540
00:32:40.057 --> 00:32:41.858
to find evidence.

541
00:32:42.388 --> 00:32:43.957
We'll do our best...

542
00:32:44.328 --> 00:32:46.398
to prove what you suffered.

543
00:32:53.668 --> 00:32:54.668
What...

544
00:32:55.898 --> 00:32:57.138
must I do?

545
00:32:58.737 --> 00:33:00.638
Tell us everything...

546
00:33:01.007 --> 00:33:03.247
that may be used as evidence.

547
00:33:20.727 --> 00:33:22.328
Darn it.

548
00:33:32.908 --> 00:33:33.908
Found it.

549
00:33:37.378 --> 00:33:39.447
The assailant's print was on the victim's clothing?

550
00:33:39.447 --> 00:33:41.918
Yes. The witness Kim Se Mi's statement...

551
00:33:41.918 --> 00:33:43.588
was also proven to be a lie.

552
00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:44.818
The clothing is good,

553
00:33:44.818 --> 00:33:47.487
and so is the fact that the testimony was false,

554
00:33:47.487 --> 00:33:48.987
but why are we taking the long way?

555
00:33:48.987 --> 00:33:50.287
We have solid evidence.

556
00:33:50.287 --> 00:33:53.158
What if the victim's sexuality comes out...

557
00:33:53.158 --> 00:33:54.527
by using the recording?

558
00:33:54.527 --> 00:33:56.568
We should just punish the assailant.

559
00:33:56.568 --> 00:33:58.598
Must we consider the victim's situation?

560
00:33:58.598 --> 00:33:59.737
Excuse me.

561
00:33:59.737 --> 00:34:01.568
The victim went along with being framed...

562
00:34:01.568 --> 00:34:03.108
in order to protect that secret.

563
00:34:03.108 --> 00:34:06.037
He refuses to testify if we use the recording.

564
00:34:06.237 --> 00:34:07.438
What will you do?

565
00:34:08.137 --> 00:34:10.508
Okay. Let's do this.

566
00:34:10.807 --> 00:34:13.878
Let's pressure Professor Sun with the fact...

567
00:34:13.878 --> 00:34:15.517
that the witness lied and the fingerprint,

568
00:34:16.048 --> 00:34:18.287
to get her to confess.

569
00:34:23.188 --> 00:34:25.287
(Evidence No. 2)

570
00:34:27.227 --> 00:34:29.798
What is this?

571
00:34:29.798 --> 00:34:31.068
You remember.

572
00:34:32.798 --> 00:34:33.798
This shirt.

573
00:34:34.267 --> 00:34:35.298
And these...

574
00:34:36.097 --> 00:34:38.707
are your fingerprints on it.

575
00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:41.977
They came out nicely. Very clear.

576
00:34:42.378 --> 00:34:44.407
I heard they used some kind of a method.

577
00:34:44.407 --> 00:34:45.608
Why...

578
00:34:46.177 --> 00:34:47.977
are you showing me this?

579
00:34:47.977 --> 00:34:49.148
You had said...

580
00:34:49.148 --> 00:34:51.418
while you were fighting Nam Woo Sung off,

581
00:34:51.418 --> 00:34:54.157
he pressed down on both your hands,

582
00:34:54.157 --> 00:34:56.387
making it impossible for you to budge.

583
00:34:56.588 --> 00:34:58.858
You couldn't budge at all,

584
00:34:58.858 --> 00:35:00.997
but you unzipped his pants,

585
00:35:00.997 --> 00:35:02.528
tore his shirt,

586
00:35:02.758 --> 00:35:04.867
and stripped him pretty roughly.

587
00:35:04.867 --> 00:35:07.198
Your statement does not match at all.

588
00:35:08.298 --> 00:35:11.468
Kim Se Mi's statement that he attacked you...

589
00:35:11.468 --> 00:35:12.938
was also proven to be false.

590
00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:14.878
So?

591
00:35:15.807 --> 00:35:17.807
Are you saying I raped...

592
00:35:18.307 --> 00:35:19.778
a young, healthy man?

593
00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:21.477
Is that it?

594
00:35:21.948 --> 00:35:23.117
Ms. Sun Hae Young.

595
00:35:24.048 --> 00:35:25.548
Did you think we'd believe you...

596
00:35:25.818 --> 00:35:27.488
if you played the weak woman?

597
00:35:27.588 --> 00:35:28.617
The evidence here,

598
00:35:28.617 --> 00:35:31.057
your lies, and the witness' lies...

599
00:35:31.057 --> 00:35:34.097
are plenty to get you for attempted rape.

600
00:35:34.097 --> 00:35:35.198
You know that, right?

601
00:35:35.298 --> 00:35:37.898
Attempted rape and rape have the same punishment.

602
00:35:37.898 --> 00:35:39.367
Why don't you confess?

603
00:35:40.097 --> 00:35:42.267
The judge will consider it and reduce your sentence.

604
00:35:42.867 --> 00:35:45.168
It's your first offense, you're a woman,

605
00:35:46.378 --> 00:35:49.137
and a professor who is loved by society.

606
00:35:51.847 --> 00:35:53.048
If I confess...

607
00:35:53.977 --> 00:35:55.818
We'll try to get you probation...

608
00:35:55.818 --> 00:35:57.247
rather than imprisonment.

609
00:35:57.747 --> 00:35:58.988
What will you do?

610
00:35:59.787 --> 00:36:02.188
A hospital is better than jail, no?

611
00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:15.698
You people are ridiculous.

612
00:36:17.968 --> 00:36:19.168
Are you telling me...

613
00:36:20.108 --> 00:36:22.338
to become a female rapist?

614
00:36:23.048 --> 00:36:24.307
Don't make me laugh.

615
00:36:25.207 --> 00:36:28.318
I never did such a thing.

616
00:36:33.657 --> 00:36:35.457
I'll get a lawyer.

617
00:36:43.767 --> 00:36:45.327
(Yeongpa District Court)

618
00:36:45.327 --> 00:36:48.497
Two young officers lost their lives...

619
00:36:49.198 --> 00:36:52.338
when the defendants swung a steel pipe and...

620
00:36:52.407 --> 00:36:53.878
hit their heads.

621
00:36:56.747 --> 00:36:59.608
They were losing their homes in the cold.

622
00:37:00.048 --> 00:37:01.878
Of course, they were angry.

623
00:37:02.448 --> 00:37:05.617
They must've wanted to argue with anyone.

624
00:37:05.988 --> 00:37:08.617
However, what we must remember...

625
00:37:09.858 --> 00:37:12.028
is that 10 years ago,

626
00:37:12.028 --> 00:37:14.698
they used violence at a protest...

627
00:37:14.698 --> 00:37:16.568
and hurt the officers on the scene...

628
00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:18.398
which hospitalized them for eight weeks.

629
00:37:18.398 --> 00:37:21.097
They both have priors.

630
00:37:21.097 --> 00:37:22.537
(Defendant)

631
00:37:22.938 --> 00:37:23.938
Thus,

632
00:37:24.168 --> 00:37:27.878
they do not try to resolve their own problems,

633
00:37:28.477 --> 00:37:31.307
but take out their anger habitually...

634
00:37:31.648 --> 00:37:33.378
on young officers.

635
00:37:33.378 --> 00:37:34.517
That's ridiculous!

636
00:37:34.517 --> 00:37:36.148
Five of our men died!

637
00:37:38.088 --> 00:37:40.188
Silence.

638
00:37:40.188 --> 00:37:41.617
Silence in the court.

639
00:37:41.617 --> 00:37:42.617
Silence.

640
00:37:45.427 --> 00:37:47.358
We cannot let people like that...

641
00:37:47.358 --> 00:37:51.097
take any more young lives, which are our future.

642
00:37:51.927 --> 00:37:55.298
Thus, we request that they be harshly punished.

644
00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:05.648
How could you do this?

645
00:38:05.648 --> 00:38:07.818
What did we do wrong?

646
00:38:15.017 --> 00:38:16.488
There he is.

647
00:38:16.488 --> 00:38:17.927
Are you satisfied with the verdict?

648
00:38:18.387 --> 00:38:20.128
Did you expect to win?

649
00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:23.398
I simply did my best.

650
00:38:23.398 --> 00:38:26.938
I thank the court for their wise decision.

651
00:38:26.938 --> 00:38:30.108
Do you really plan to run for mayor of Yeongpa?

652
00:38:30.108 --> 00:38:31.568
Please tell us.

653
00:38:31.568 --> 00:38:33.177
Will you be running?

654
00:38:39.048 --> 00:38:42.177
If you are really curious, I guess...

655
00:38:42.177 --> 00:38:43.488
I'll tell you.

656
00:38:44.117 --> 00:38:47.818
For the past 30 years, I, Cho Gap Soo,

657
00:38:48.358 --> 00:38:50.657
have dedicated my life...

658
00:38:50.657 --> 00:38:52.457
for a society where justice prevails,

659
00:38:52.457 --> 00:38:55.698
and for a safe and happy nation.

660
00:38:56.327 --> 00:38:58.028
As a police officer and a politician,

661
00:38:58.727 --> 00:39:01.668
I worked around the clock to create such a society.

662
00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:04.537
Now,

663
00:39:05.267 --> 00:39:07.278
I plan to dedicate my passion and energy...

664
00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:11.747
to create a new Yeongpa in which...

665
00:39:11.747 --> 00:39:12.948
the citizens...

666
00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.278
are the masters.

667
00:39:19.688 --> 00:39:21.488
Former assemblyman, Cho Gap Soo,

668
00:39:21.488 --> 00:39:22.887
has announced his candidacy...

669
00:39:22.887 --> 00:39:24.688
for Yeongpa mayor.

670
00:39:24.688 --> 00:39:25.758
As a result,

671
00:39:25.758 --> 00:39:28.798
Mayor Kim Moon Sung's ratings fell,

672
00:39:28.798 --> 00:39:31.767
and experts speculate the mayoral election...

673
00:39:31.767 --> 00:39:34.537
will be a close and interesting race.

(Cho Gap Soo Running for Mayor)

675
00:39:42.207 --> 00:39:43.548
Did you watch the news?

676
00:39:47.177 --> 00:39:48.177
What?

677
00:39:55.517 --> 00:39:57.688
This is just the start.

678
00:39:58.758 --> 00:40:01.398
I'll open our campaign office next week.

679
00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:06.298
Stop worrying about stupid things.

680
00:40:06.298 --> 00:40:09.037
Just prepare a nice, fat wallet.

681
00:40:18.448 --> 00:40:20.517
We received a new rape case.

682
00:40:20.648 --> 00:40:21.677
Rape?

683
00:40:22.677 --> 00:40:26.088
They came to the right man.

684
00:40:26.517 --> 00:40:28.318
Who's the client?

685
00:40:29.057 --> 00:40:31.727
The second daughter of the director...

686
00:40:32.088 --> 00:40:33.157
of Sunwoo Foundation?

687
00:40:34.597 --> 00:40:37.367
How did the daughter of such a rich family...

688
00:40:37.367 --> 00:40:39.327
have such a thing happen to her?

689
00:40:39.528 --> 00:40:42.338
She isn't the victim, but the assailant.

690
00:40:44.707 --> 00:40:48.207
The assailant is a woman?

691
00:40:54.517 --> 00:40:57.517
This case sounds fun.

692
00:40:59.287 --> 00:41:02.457
Who's the prosecutor in charge?

693
00:41:03.258 --> 00:41:05.727
The Crimes Against Girls Unit.

694
00:41:06.258 --> 00:41:08.427
It's where Min Ji Sook is.

695
00:41:09.528 --> 00:41:11.068
Min Ji Sook?

696
00:41:12.997 --> 00:41:16.537
I haven't heard that name in a while.

697
00:41:19.738 --> 00:41:20.807
Ms. Ha.

698
00:41:21.438 --> 00:41:25.477
Why don't you take on Ji Sook and humble her?

699
00:41:25.577 --> 00:41:27.577
I'll go watch.

700
00:41:28.448 --> 00:41:29.517
Yes, sir.

701
00:41:30.818 --> 00:41:31.887
Your Honor.

702
00:41:32.088 --> 00:41:34.858
We'd like to request a closed trial.

703
00:41:35.358 --> 00:41:37.258
The victim does not want a public trial.

704
00:41:37.457 --> 00:41:38.988
Moreover, considering...

705
00:41:39.427 --> 00:41:41.927
how much attention this case is getting,

706
00:41:42.398 --> 00:41:44.528
we cannot ignore the harm the victim will suffer.

707
00:41:44.867 --> 00:41:48.267
Our client is the one suffering right now.

708
00:41:48.798 --> 00:41:51.867
Look online. Her related search term is...

709
00:41:52.137 --> 00:41:53.577
"female rapist".

710
00:41:53.608 --> 00:41:56.378
That supports the need for a closed trial.

711
00:41:56.577 --> 00:41:57.677
Counsel,

712
00:41:57.977 --> 00:41:59.677
you need to think carefully.

713
00:41:59.878 --> 00:42:03.287
Once the trial starts, she may be harmed more.

714
00:42:03.747 --> 00:42:05.488
Can you handle it?

715
00:42:06.287 --> 00:42:07.387
Your Honor.

716
00:42:09.387 --> 00:42:10.588
I'm sorry, but...

717
00:42:12.488 --> 00:42:14.528
may I say something?

718
00:42:19.168 --> 00:42:20.367
I've been pegged...

719
00:42:21.637 --> 00:42:24.807
as a loathsome woman who assaulted her student.

720
00:42:26.207 --> 00:42:28.938
I had to take a break from my university...

721
00:42:30.077 --> 00:42:33.077
and send my children to my family in the US.

722
00:42:34.918 --> 00:42:36.177
I lost my job...

723
00:42:37.718 --> 00:42:39.918
as well as my children.

724
00:42:41.517 --> 00:42:43.457
What more harm could I possibly suffer?

725
00:42:45.528 --> 00:42:47.528
I want to die every day,

726
00:42:51.028 --> 00:42:54.267
but proving my innocence...

727
00:42:55.738 --> 00:42:57.867
during a public trial...

728
00:42:59.608 --> 00:43:01.637
is my only way to survive.

729
00:43:01.938 --> 00:43:04.177
Look here, ma'am.

730
00:43:04.948 --> 00:43:06.918
By what proof do you claim innocence?

731
00:43:07.517 --> 00:43:09.477
Don't you worry about being found guilty...

732
00:43:09.477 --> 00:43:12.347
in front of all the people and being humiliated...

733
00:43:12.688 --> 00:43:13.787
at all?

734
00:43:18.088 --> 00:43:19.188
Counsel.

735
00:43:20.157 --> 00:43:21.628
Please be courteous.

736
00:43:24.367 --> 00:43:26.698
It is a sensitive matter,

737
00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.097
and neither party wishes to settle,

738
00:43:29.468 --> 00:43:32.438
so we will proceed in an open trial.

739
00:43:36.307 --> 00:43:37.548
Thank you.

740
00:43:49.457 --> 00:43:50.657
Good job.

741
00:44:02.398 --> 00:44:03.608
Ms. Sun!

742
00:44:05.238 --> 00:44:06.707
You worm.

743
00:44:08.137 --> 00:44:10.207
How dare you insult me?

744
00:44:11.307 --> 00:44:14.017
Do you know what I'm enduring because of you?

745
00:44:14.247 --> 00:44:15.577
Please calm down.

746
00:44:15.918 --> 00:44:16.918
You...

747
00:44:18.218 --> 00:44:20.157
I will destroy you.

748
00:44:22.418 --> 00:44:23.557
Prepare yourself.

749
00:44:38.238 --> 00:44:39.367
Are you okay?

750
00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:45.448
Why do you want to beat a weak woman?

751
00:44:46.108 --> 00:44:47.878
You should stop here...

752
00:44:48.378 --> 00:44:50.218
before something worse happens.

753
00:45:02.358 --> 00:45:03.827
Did you just threaten him?

754
00:45:04.827 --> 00:45:07.867
I felt bad for him, so I gave him some advice.

755
00:45:08.097 --> 00:45:11.407
Do you think you're in a position to give advice?

756
00:45:11.938 --> 00:45:14.108
We'll determine in court whether or not...

757
00:45:14.778 --> 00:45:16.238
I am in such a position.

758
00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:31.927
She's incredible.

759
00:45:35.758 --> 00:45:38.867
We will now begin case number 2017GO1245,

760
00:45:39.298 --> 00:45:41.767
the people versus Sun Hae Young,

761
00:45:42.168 --> 00:45:45.307
at Seoul Central District Court.

762
00:45:45.807 --> 00:45:48.577
First, we will check attendance of the parties.

763
00:45:49.378 --> 00:45:50.508
Prosecutor.

764
00:45:51.077 --> 00:45:52.907
- Are you present? - Yes.

765
00:45:53.077 --> 00:45:55.778
- Defendant Sun Hae Young? - Yes.

766
00:45:55.918 --> 00:45:58.247
- Defense Counsel? - Yes.

767
00:45:58.548 --> 00:46:01.418
Jurors, are you present?

768
00:46:01.418 --> 00:46:02.488
Yes.

769
00:46:02.588 --> 00:46:05.157
Okay. We will now begin.

770
00:46:05.858 --> 00:46:08.898
Being the only one whose thesis was rejected,

771
00:46:09.528 --> 00:46:12.068
the victim goes to the professor to ask why.

772
00:46:12.267 --> 00:46:15.267
The professor states his thesis is excellent,

773
00:46:15.597 --> 00:46:18.068
but he lacks just one thing.

774
00:46:19.778 --> 00:46:20.977
What could that one thing be?

775
00:46:24.677 --> 00:46:25.807
That's correct.

776
00:46:26.677 --> 00:46:29.988
She demanded sexual favors in exchange.

777
00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:38.588
Head down, and look pitiful.

778
00:46:39.157 --> 00:46:41.358
You look like an assailant right now.

779
00:46:44.267 --> 00:46:46.568
While he was deciding whether to grant...

780
00:46:46.838 --> 00:46:49.438
her improper request and get his degree,

781
00:46:49.497 --> 00:46:52.367
the professor ripped her student's shirt,

782
00:46:52.367 --> 00:46:54.508
unzipped his pants, and initiated sex.

783
00:46:55.407 --> 00:46:57.608
Simply put, this is what this case is about.

784
00:46:59.077 --> 00:47:02.218
A professor used a student's degree...

785
00:47:03.218 --> 00:47:04.818
to sexually assault a student.

786
00:47:04.818 --> 00:47:07.358
Defense denies prosecution's assertions.

787
00:47:08.457 --> 00:47:11.787
Let's say a woman in her 40s tried to rape...

788
00:47:12.128 --> 00:47:14.097
a healthy young man in his 20s.

789
00:47:14.258 --> 00:47:16.827
How could he not resist...

790
00:47:17.068 --> 00:47:19.128
and let it happen?

791
00:47:19.968 --> 00:47:21.398
Think about it.

792
00:47:23.738 --> 00:47:26.938
We request that you use your rational judgment...

793
00:47:27.008 --> 00:47:28.338
to decide.

794
00:47:31.707 --> 00:47:32.807
That is all.

795
00:47:33.247 --> 00:47:36.117
(Fingerprint Results)

796
00:47:36.117 --> 00:47:38.588
Typically, 500ng to 1,000ng of proteins...

797
00:47:38.787 --> 00:47:41.818
or amino acids are detected in fingerprints.

798
00:47:42.418 --> 00:47:44.327
However, from this shirt and pants,

799
00:47:44.488 --> 00:47:47.097
more than 2,000ng was detected.

800
00:47:47.358 --> 00:47:48.657
What does that mean?

801
00:47:49.497 --> 00:47:50.827
I shows that defendant...

802
00:47:51.668 --> 00:47:53.198
applied great strength...

803
00:47:53.738 --> 00:47:56.707
in ripping the victim's clothes.

804
00:47:58.207 --> 00:48:00.608
Defense cannot accept prosecution's assertions.

805
00:48:00.977 --> 00:48:02.838
We will review the evidence submitted.

806
00:48:11.588 --> 00:48:12.718
As you can see.

807
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:14.588
Even if the defendant...

808
00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:17.227
pushed the witness away,

809
00:48:17.528 --> 00:48:20.097
a similar amount was detected.

810
00:48:20.258 --> 00:48:24.168
Thus, prosecution's claim that the defendant...

811
00:48:24.798 --> 00:48:26.568
ripped the witness' shirt lacks credibility.

812
00:48:32.968 --> 00:48:34.878
Around 11pm on the night of the incident,

813
00:48:35.378 --> 00:48:37.677
you went to the defendant's lab alone.

814
00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.948
- Is that correct? - Yes.

815
00:48:40.347 --> 00:48:42.177
Why did you go...

816
00:48:42.318 --> 00:48:44.847
to a woman's lab alone that late at night?

817
00:48:45.517 --> 00:48:47.517
You could've gone the next day.

818
00:48:47.688 --> 00:48:50.588
The final decisions were due at 10am.

819
00:48:50.988 --> 00:48:52.688
I was in too much of a rush...

820
00:48:53.798 --> 00:48:55.798
that it didn't cross my mind.

821
00:48:56.128 --> 00:48:57.267
So?

822
00:48:57.427 --> 00:49:01.568
Did you ask why she failed only your thesis?

823
00:49:01.867 --> 00:49:03.537
- Yes. - And?

824
00:49:03.838 --> 00:49:05.707
She said she made edits on her tablet PC...

825
00:49:05.707 --> 00:49:07.537
and told me to look through them.

826
00:49:07.807 --> 00:49:09.338
So I was looking at them, and...

827
00:49:12.807 --> 00:49:16.517
the professor started to touch my thigh.

828
00:49:18.548 --> 00:49:21.858
She could've just placed her hand there.

829
00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:23.358
To be exact,

830
00:49:24.427 --> 00:49:27.758
she was squeezing my thigh.

831
00:49:32.798 --> 00:49:34.968
- Were you excited? - No.

832
00:49:41.037 --> 00:49:42.838
Then, she grabbed my face,

833
00:49:44.608 --> 00:49:45.807
and kissed me.

834
00:49:50.517 --> 00:49:51.648
How much?

835
00:49:52.188 --> 00:49:53.418
I don't know.

836
00:49:53.858 --> 00:49:57.057
Are you saying you let her kiss you?

837
00:49:57.858 --> 00:50:00.298
- Yes. - Did you enjoy it?

838
00:50:00.298 --> 00:50:01.298
No, I did not.

839
00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:03.068
Why did you let her kiss you, then?

840
00:50:03.568 --> 00:50:05.227
You should've been able to thwart her off.

841
00:50:05.997 --> 00:50:07.168
Did you...

842
00:50:08.698 --> 00:50:10.668
see the defendant as a woman at that moment?

843
00:50:10.938 --> 00:50:12.468
I never saw her as a woman.

844
00:50:12.468 --> 00:50:14.207
Then it doesn't make sense.

845
00:50:14.207 --> 00:50:16.747
You never saw her as a woman,

846
00:50:16.878 --> 00:50:18.108
and you didn't like her touching you.

847
00:50:18.108 --> 00:50:19.278
Yet, you let her kiss you...

848
00:50:19.278 --> 00:50:21.818
and let her take your clothes off?

849
00:50:22.148 --> 00:50:23.218
Does that make sense?

850
00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:26.318
Sure, she was your professor,

851
00:50:26.318 --> 00:50:27.918
but you're a man.

852
00:50:28.287 --> 00:50:30.188
You could've overpowered her.

853
00:50:30.188 --> 00:50:32.327
I told you. My thesis was on the line.

854
00:50:32.327 --> 00:50:34.028
Was that so important?

855
00:50:34.827 --> 00:50:36.427
You're a man. Have you no pride?

856
00:50:36.898 --> 00:50:38.168
Most men...

857
00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:39.968
would've kicked his way out.

858
00:50:39.968 --> 00:50:41.097
Do you know...

859
00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:45.807
how much tuition for grad school is?

860
00:50:46.407 --> 00:50:47.878
Do you know...

861
00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:50.008
how many hours you must work to get a doctorate?

862
00:50:51.378 --> 00:50:53.218
If I upset her and leave the program,

863
00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:55.648
what then?

864
00:50:57.347 --> 00:50:59.247
If the degree was so important,

865
00:50:59.787 --> 00:51:01.657
you should've endured it.

866
00:51:01.887 --> 00:51:04.457
Why did you refuse to have sex with her?

867
00:51:06.497 --> 00:51:08.157
You should've endured it.

868
00:51:11.827 --> 00:51:12.927
You're right.

869
00:51:14.267 --> 00:51:15.338
You're correct.

870
00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:20.037
If I had just endured it as you say,

871
00:51:20.508 --> 00:51:22.477
I would've gotten my thesis through,

872
00:51:22.907 --> 00:51:24.508
and I wouldn't...

873
00:51:25.448 --> 00:51:27.077
be here doing this.

874
00:51:28.977 --> 00:51:30.017
I...

875
00:51:31.017 --> 00:51:32.318
was wrong.

876
00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:36.218
It's all my fault.

877
00:51:45.898 --> 00:51:47.037
No more questions.

878
00:52:05.418 --> 00:52:06.488
After...

879
00:52:06.918 --> 00:52:08.957
you started the grad school,

880
00:52:09.057 --> 00:52:11.457
you applied with another professor...

881
00:52:11.457 --> 00:52:12.887
for apprenticeship...

882
00:52:12.887 --> 00:52:14.528
and was rejected.

883
00:52:15.258 --> 00:52:17.327
You had excellent grades.

884
00:52:17.327 --> 00:52:19.028
Why were you rejected?

885
00:52:19.668 --> 00:52:22.637
Your Honor. This question is irrelevant to the case.

886
00:52:22.637 --> 00:52:25.367
It is important for determining the witness...

887
00:52:25.367 --> 00:52:26.838
and defendant's relationship.

888
00:52:26.838 --> 00:52:27.977
Proceed.

889
00:52:30.148 --> 00:52:31.307
Please answer.

890
00:52:31.407 --> 00:52:32.548
I was told it was because...

891
00:52:32.548 --> 00:52:35.148
I came from a small school and had a different major.

892
00:52:35.617 --> 00:52:37.188
And yet,

893
00:52:37.347 --> 00:52:39.387
the defendant saw your potential and chose you...

894
00:52:39.387 --> 00:52:41.258
to be her research assistant.

895
00:52:42.258 --> 00:52:43.427
Do you agree?

896
00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:44.927
Yes.

897
00:52:44.927 --> 00:52:46.327
On the day of the incident,

898
00:52:46.327 --> 00:52:48.798
when you found out your thesis was rejected,

899
00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:51.528
how did you feel at that moment?

900
00:52:52.898 --> 00:52:54.068
How did I feel?

901
00:52:55.097 --> 00:52:56.537
I was upset, naturally.

902
00:52:57.367 --> 00:52:58.468
And angry.

903
00:52:59.878 --> 00:53:00.977
Yes.

904
00:53:02.508 --> 00:53:03.677
That's why...

905
00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:06.747
you decided to get revenge.

906
00:53:06.847 --> 00:53:08.247
Is that it?

907
00:53:09.117 --> 00:53:10.318
What?

908
00:53:10.318 --> 00:53:12.247
Why are you suddenly bringing up revenge?

909
00:53:12.448 --> 00:53:14.218
What is your intention?

910
00:53:14.387 --> 00:53:16.758
Your Honor, we submit evidence...

911
00:53:16.988 --> 00:53:20.358
from his social media account that shows...

912
00:53:20.358 --> 00:53:22.727
he intended to frame the defendant.

913
00:53:22.727 --> 00:53:25.968
Objection. Not only did we not see it,

914
00:53:25.968 --> 00:53:28.267
it hasn't been authenticated.

915
00:53:28.298 --> 00:53:31.137
Counsel. I told you I wouldn't accept...

916
00:53:31.137 --> 00:53:33.207
evidence that were not previously authenticated.

917
00:53:33.207 --> 00:53:34.938
My apologies. However,

918
00:53:35.707 --> 00:53:38.108
you must know that this case is handled by...

919
00:53:38.108 --> 00:53:41.278
the Crimes Against Girls Unit.

920
00:53:41.648 --> 00:53:43.318
The trial date was set...

921
00:53:43.318 --> 00:53:44.948
within three days of the investigation.

922
00:53:45.148 --> 00:53:48.188
We only discovered it this morning,

923
00:53:48.287 --> 00:53:50.457
and did not have time to submit it sooner.

924
00:53:50.528 --> 00:53:51.927
Please let us submit it.

925
00:53:52.427 --> 00:53:53.657
Okay.

926
00:53:53.898 --> 00:53:55.057
Turn it on.

927
00:53:55.327 --> 00:53:56.427
Thank you.

928
00:54:03.867 --> 00:54:04.968
(She's so annoying.)

929
00:54:09.077 --> 00:54:10.878
(She's wearing a skirt, trying to be coy.)

930
00:54:10.878 --> 00:54:12.278
(Once my thesis gets through, I'll expose her.)

931
00:54:24.727 --> 00:54:27.128
You wrote these, correct?

932
00:54:27.157 --> 00:54:29.557
You cut off everything before it.

933
00:54:29.557 --> 00:54:31.968
Do you admit that you wrote...

934
00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:33.338
what is on the screen?

935
00:54:33.938 --> 00:54:35.137
This is ridiculous.

936
00:54:35.738 --> 00:54:38.537
Your Honor. These are irrelevant to the case,

937
00:54:38.537 --> 00:54:40.378
and they appear to have been selected...

938
00:54:40.378 --> 00:54:42.378
and taken out of context.

939
00:54:42.378 --> 00:54:43.548
I agree.

940
00:54:43.548 --> 00:54:44.907
Fine.

941
00:54:45.378 --> 00:54:49.048
It's not like I can't understand the witness.

942
00:54:49.247 --> 00:54:51.718
It's natural to badmouth your teacher...

943
00:54:51.718 --> 00:54:53.358
or your boss.

944
00:54:54.418 --> 00:54:55.617
However,

945
00:54:56.787 --> 00:54:58.887
you chatted with only one person...

946
00:54:58.887 --> 00:55:01.327
about the defendant.

947
00:55:01.327 --> 00:55:02.827
Is it a problem...

948
00:55:03.927 --> 00:55:06.367
that I'm an outcast and have no one to talk to?

949
00:55:06.367 --> 00:55:07.367
Look.

950
00:55:08.497 --> 00:55:09.637
You...

951
00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:14.707
are homosexual, and like men, correct?

952
00:55:17.878 --> 00:55:20.948
That person to whom you sent those messages...

953
00:55:21.077 --> 00:55:22.918
was your boyfriend of three years.

954
00:55:35.497 --> 00:55:36.528
My apologies.

955
00:55:37.997 --> 00:55:38.997
Your Honor.

956
00:55:39.367 --> 00:55:42.398
Prosecution is violating the witness' privacy.

957
00:55:42.398 --> 00:55:45.367
Can a homosexual man be raped by a woman?

958
00:55:45.537 --> 00:55:49.077
If he was an average man who liked women,

959
00:55:49.307 --> 00:55:51.508
when a woman made a sexual advance,

960
00:55:51.608 --> 00:55:53.448
he would've either enjoyed it,

961
00:55:53.448 --> 00:55:56.418
or used his physical strength...

962
00:55:56.418 --> 00:55:59.247
to thwart her off easily.

963
00:56:00.088 --> 00:56:01.418
However,

964
00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:04.258
because you are gay, and don't like women,

965
00:56:04.557 --> 00:56:08.258
you framed the innocent woman for rape.

966
00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:09.968
I did not.

967
00:56:09.968 --> 00:56:12.367
Then try and refute it.

968
00:56:12.528 --> 00:56:15.238
You have always loathed the defendant...

969
00:56:15.238 --> 00:56:16.968
who is a woman.

970
00:56:16.968 --> 00:56:19.637
Your thesis was rejected, so you wanted revenge.

971
00:56:19.938 --> 00:56:23.177
That is why you framed her for sexual assault!

972
00:56:23.177 --> 00:56:24.477
I did not!

973
00:56:26.577 --> 00:56:27.818
Take him away.

974
00:56:32.247 --> 00:56:33.287
Let go!

975
00:56:35.488 --> 00:56:36.588
Let go!

976
00:56:38.957 --> 00:56:40.198
Quiet!

977
00:56:41.057 --> 00:56:42.798
Prosecution. Defense.

978
00:56:43.398 --> 00:56:45.528
Can we continue with the trial?

979
00:56:46.068 --> 00:56:47.398
Should we take a break?

980
00:56:47.597 --> 00:56:49.867
No, Your Honor. Let us continue.

981
00:56:51.338 --> 00:56:53.977
Yes, we are fine as well.

982
00:57:01.247 --> 00:57:02.418
To be honest,

983
00:57:04.148 --> 00:57:06.887
this entire situation is too much for me.

984
00:57:09.218 --> 00:57:11.758
I've been respected by the society,

985
00:57:13.398 --> 00:57:14.727
and I've been loved...

986
00:57:14.997 --> 00:57:17.168
by my family as well.

987
00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:20.367
What do I lack...

988
00:57:23.037 --> 00:57:26.537
that I'd do something so heinous?

989
00:57:26.637 --> 00:57:29.477
I simply want to be free from this situation...

990
00:57:30.108 --> 00:57:31.608
in which I am...

991
00:57:32.008 --> 00:57:34.247
being framed of such a crime.

992
00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:39.017
No more questions.

993
00:57:42.457 --> 00:57:45.387
Prosecution. Any questions?

994
00:57:46.427 --> 00:57:47.557
Your Honor.

995
00:57:48.057 --> 00:57:49.827
We submit a recording...

996
00:57:49.827 --> 00:57:54.198
of the defendant trying to rape the victim.

997
00:57:55.137 --> 00:57:56.137
Prosecution.

998
00:57:56.738 --> 00:57:58.807
You'll submit what?

999
00:57:59.338 --> 00:58:00.677
Ms. Ma.

1000
00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:04.847
We knew the victim was homosexual.

1001
00:58:04.847 --> 00:58:07.617
We also knew that his boyfriend...

1002
00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:11.548
had recorded the sexual assault that night.

1003
00:58:12.387 --> 00:58:14.318
However, the victim was adamantly against...

1004
00:58:14.318 --> 00:58:17.787
his sexuality being exposed during the trial.

1005
00:58:18.227 --> 00:58:20.358
That is why we did not submit it into evidence.

1006
00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:22.858
But as you saw earlier,

1007
00:58:22.858 --> 00:58:27.267
defense exposed the victim's privacy,

1008
00:58:27.267 --> 00:58:29.938
so we do not have the need to hesitate.

1009
00:58:30.307 --> 00:58:32.738
We will submit the evidence.

1010
00:58:47.017 --> 00:58:49.157
Ms. Ma, do you know Nam Woo Sung's number?

1011
00:58:57.398 --> 00:58:58.597
Please tell him...

1012
00:58:58.597 --> 00:59:01.238
to seal his social media accounts for now.

1013
00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:06.068
Especially anything about Yoon Min Joo.

1014
00:59:08.438 --> 00:59:09.778
Yoon Min Joo?

1015
00:59:13.008 --> 00:59:15.847
Hey. Get me Nam Woo Sung's call records.

1016
00:59:28.128 --> 00:59:29.927
Let me borrow your phone.

1017
00:59:30.827 --> 00:59:31.968
Why?

1018
00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:33.597
Hurry. My battery's dead.

1019
00:59:36.668 --> 00:59:39.367
You are homosexual, correct?

1020
00:59:47.278 --> 00:59:49.347
Let's hear it.

1021
00:59:49.648 --> 00:59:50.648
Yes, Your Honor.

1022
01:00:01.157 --> 01:00:03.767
I know your thesis is excellent.

1023
01:00:05.927 --> 01:00:07.037
Professor.

1024
01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:08.968
You have a nice body.

1025
01:00:12.707 --> 01:00:15.438
Professor!

1026
01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:18.448
Professor!

1027
01:00:23.648 --> 01:00:25.718
- Professor! - No!

1028
01:00:26.117 --> 01:00:27.488
- Professor. - It's a lie.

1029
01:00:28.457 --> 01:00:29.657
It's a fabrication!

1030
01:00:30.028 --> 01:00:31.758
I'm being framed! No!

1031
01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:34.528
I'm being framed! You. Woo Sung.

1032
01:00:34.858 --> 01:00:36.398
Tell the truth!

1033
01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:39.128
Lies!

1034
01:00:39.327 --> 01:00:40.997
It's all lies!

1035
01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:42.738
Let go!

1036
01:00:43.568 --> 01:00:46.068
- Let go! - Keep it down!

1037
01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:51.077
(Deliberation in Progress)

1038
01:00:51.207 --> 01:00:52.347
The verdict is out.

1039
01:00:52.347 --> 01:00:54.448
A year and half in jail and 3 years probation.

1040
01:00:54.648 --> 01:00:57.918
The victim is gay. This case is interesting.

1041
01:01:00.117 --> 01:01:02.157
What a way to stab someone in the back.

1042
01:01:03.157 --> 01:01:05.057
- Sorry? - It was you, wasn't it?

1043
01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:07.097
You leaked to the defense that Woo Sung was gay.

1044
01:01:07.628 --> 01:01:08.727
Well...

1045
01:01:09.727 --> 01:01:11.427
Regardless, we won.

1046
01:01:12.698 --> 01:01:14.037
"Regardless, we won?"

1047
01:01:15.097 --> 01:01:16.568
Didn't you see how he looked

1048
01:01:16.568 --> 01:01:18.707
when it came up earlier?

1049
01:01:19.367 --> 01:01:21.977
- I did. - Don't you think about...

1050
01:01:21.977 --> 01:01:23.347
how he must feel right now?

1051
01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.918
Why must I do that?

1052
01:01:27.577 --> 01:01:28.648
What?

1053
01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:32.488
I'm a prosecutor, not a lawyer.

1054
01:01:40.227 --> 01:01:41.298
She's coming.

1055
01:01:43.028 --> 01:01:46.497
How does it feel to win with a single blow?

1056
01:01:46.497 --> 01:01:48.597
When did you know that the victim was gay?

1057
01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:53.278
Hello. I'm Ma Yi Deum, A prosecutor...

1058
01:01:53.537 --> 01:01:55.438
with Crimes Against Girls Unit.

1059
01:02:21.168 --> 01:02:23.707
(Witch's Court)

1060
01:02:23.707 --> 01:02:26.577
I took the bait that you laid out...

1061
01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:29.278
- and paid for it. - She's a peculiar one.

1062
01:02:29.438 --> 01:02:31.677
It's all over the internet already.

1063
01:02:31.878 --> 01:02:34.177
He may have approached the women...

1064
01:02:34.177 --> 01:02:36.148
planning to film them having sex.

1065
01:02:36.148 --> 01:02:37.918
It's a waste to watch alone.

1066
01:02:38.117 --> 01:02:39.548
The second victim.

1067
01:02:39.617 --> 01:02:41.657
I'm chasing a sick punk who posts videos...

1068
01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:43.688
of his girlfriends.

1069
01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:45.588
Imagine you were used to satisfy the needs of...

1070
01:02:45.588 --> 01:02:46.898
some guys you don't know.

1071
01:02:46.927 --> 01:02:49.028
How would you feel?

1072
01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:51.327
Kim Sun Kyoo said he was a victim too.

1073
01:02:51.327 --> 01:02:52.767
Are you some kind of a psychopath?

1074
01:02:52.997 --> 01:02:54.198
Ms. Ma!
